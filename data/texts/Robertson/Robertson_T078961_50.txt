HEN Grijalva returned to Cuba, he found the arma- BO 0 lO
ment defined to attempt the conquest of that rich
country which he had discovered, almost complete. Preparation5
Not only ambition, but avarice, had urged Velasquez to haften of Velasquez

for invading

his preparations; and having such a profpet: of gratifying both, New Spain.
he had advanced considerable fums out of his private fortune
towards defraying the expence. At the fame time, he exerted
his influence as governor, in engaging the most diftinguifled
persons in the colony to undertake the service". At a time
when the spirit of the Spanish nation was adventurous to ex-
cess, a number of soldiers, eager to embark in any daring en-
terprifc, soon appeared. But it was not so easy to find a person
qualified to take the command in an expedition of so much im-
portance ; and the character of Velasquez, who had the right
of nomination, greatly increaecd the difficulty of the choice.

V. .--,.--. for government, he poffefied neither such courage, nor such
'1 "' vigour and acivity of mind, as to undertake in person the con-

dud of the armament which he was preparing. In this embar-
raffing situation, he formed the chimerical scheme not only ofat-
chieving great exploits by a deputy, but offccuring to himself the
glory of conquefis which were to be made by another. In the
execution of this plan, he fondly aimed at reconciling contradic-
tions. He was solicitous to chufe a commander of intrepid
resolution, and of superior abilities, because he knew these to
be requisite in order to ensure success ; but, at the fame time,
from the jealousy natural to little minds, he wvifhed this person
to be of a spirit so tame and obsequious, as to be entirely de-
pendant on his will. But when he came to apply those ideas in
forming an opinion concerning the several officers who occurred
to his thoughts as worthy of being entrusted with the command,
he soon perceived that it was impossible to find such incom-
patible qualities united in one characer. Such as were diftin-
guifhed for courage and talents were too high-fpirited to be
paflive intfruments in his hand. Those who appeared more
gentle and tradable, were deltitute of capacity, and unequal to
the charge. This augmented his perplexity and his fears. He
deliberated long, and with much solicitude, and was fill waver-
ing in his choice, when Amador de Lares, the royal treafurcr
in Cuba, and Andres Ducro, his own fccretary, the two per-
sons in whom lie chiefly confided, were encouraged by this ir-
rcfolution to propole a new candidate, and they iupportcd their
rccomninmcndation with fiich afidluity and address, that, no lets
fatally for Vclafqutlz thain happily for their country, it proved

TH E

THE man whom they pointed out to him was Fernando C 0 l0K

V.

Cortes. He was born at Mcdellin, a finall town in Eftrema- -
dura, in the year one thousand four hundred and eighty-five, r-IcaLpUi.
and defeended from a family of noble blood, but of very mo- mo.Srcon'
derate fortune. Being originally deflined by his parents to the
fludy of law, as the most likely method of bettering his con-
dition, he was sent early to the university of Salamanca, where
he imbibed some tincture of learning. But lie was soon dif-
gusted with an academic life, which did not suit his ardent and
restless genius, and retired to Medellin, where he gave limfielf
up entirely to active sports and martial exercises. At this pe-
riod of life, he was so impetuous, so overbearing, and so difli-
pated, that his father was glad to comply with his inclination,
and fend him abroad as an adventurer in arms. There were
in that age two conspicuous theatres, on which fucli of the
Spanish youth as courted military glory might display their va-
lour; one in Italy, under the command of the Great Captain;
the other in the New World. Cortes preferred the forlmer,
but was prevented by indisposition from embarking with a re-
inforcement of troops sent to Naples. Upon this dislappoint-
ment he turned his views towards America, whither he was
allured by the profpcd of tlhe advantages whlich he might de-
rive from the patronage of Ovando l, the governor of I-lifia-
niola, who was his kinfinan. When he landed at St. Domingo
in one thousand five hundred and four, his reception was fitcli
as equalled his molf sanguine hopes, and he was employed by
the governor in several honourable and lucrative flations.
These, however, did not satisfy his ambition; and in the year
one thousand five lihundred and eleven, he obtained permiflion
to accompany Diego Vclalfluez in his expedition to Cuba. In

B 2. this

B o K this service he diflinguifled himself so much, that, notwith-
V_. flanding some violent contests with Velasquez, occasioned by,
s58.' trivial events, unworthy of remembrance, he was at length

taken into favour, and received an ample concession of lands
and of Indians, the recompence usually belfowed upon adven-
turers in the New World d.

THOUGH Cortes had not hitherto aCted in high command,

he had displayed such qualities in several scenes of difficulty
and danger, as raised universal expecation, and turned the eyes
of his countrymen towards him, as one capable of performing
great things. The turbulence of youth, as soon as he found
objects and occupations suited to the ardour of his mind, gra-
dually subsided, and fettled into a habit of regular indefatigable
acivity. The impetuosity of his temper, when he came to at
with his equals, insensibly abated, by being kept under re-
firaint, and mellowed into a cordial soldierly frankners. These
qualities were accompanied with calm prudence in concerting
his schemes, with persevering vigour in executing them, and
with what is peculiar to superior genius, the art of gaining the
confidence and governing the minds of men. To all which
were added the inferior accomplishments that strike the vulgar,
and command their refpea; a graceful person, a winning as-
peC, extraordinary address in martial exercises, and a conftitu-
tion of such vigour as to be capable of enduring any fatigue.

As soon as Cortes was mentioned to Velasquez by his-two

confidents, he' flattered himself that he had at length found
what he had hitherto fought in vain, a man with talents for
command, but not an objec ofjealoufy. Neither the rank nor

aspire at independence. He had reason to believe, that by his '---
own readiness to bury ancient animofities in oblivion, as well 58.
as his liberality in conferring several recent favours, he had al-
ready gained the good-will of Cortes, and hoped, by this new
and unexpected mark of confidence, that he might attach him.
for ever to his interest-

CORTES receiving his commiflion with the warmest expref- Soonbecomes

sions of refpet and gratitude to the governor, immediately heimusf
ereced his flandard before his own house, appeared in a mili- OWober 23.-
tary dress, and assumed all the ensigns of his new dignity.
His utmost influence and aativity were exerted in persuading
many of his friends to engage in the service, and in urging.
forward the preparations for the voyage. All his own funds,
together with what money he could raise by mortgaging his
lands and Indians, were expended in purchasing military stores
and provisions, or in. fipplying the wants of such of his officers
as were unable to equip themselves in a manner suited to their
rank . Inoffensive, and even laudable as this conduCt was,
his disappointed competitors were malicious enough to give it a
turn to his disadvantage : They represented him as aiming al-
ready, with little disguise, at eflablifhing an independent au-
thority over his troops, and endeavouring to secure their rcfpcct
or love by his ostentatious and intereflcd liberality. They re-
minded Velasquez of his former difenfions with the man in
whom he now reposcd so much confidence, and foretold that
Cortes would be more apt to avail himself of the power, which
the governor was inconsiderately putting in his hands, to

V.
---- insinuations made such impression upon the suspicious mind of
'.''' Velasquez, that Cortes soon observed some symptoms of a grow-

ing alienation and distrust in his behaviour, and was advised by
Lares and Duero, to haften his departure, before these flould
become so confirmed, as to break out with open violence.
Fully sensible of this danger, he urged forward his preparations
with such rapidity, that he set fail from St. Jago de Cuba on
the eighteenth of November, Velafqluez accompanying him to
the shore, and taking leave of him with an appearance of per-
sea friendship and confidence, though he had secretly given it
in charge to iome of Corics's officers, to keep a watchful eye
upon every part of their commander's conduCt

El.dcavous CORTES proceeded to Trinidad, a small settlement on the
to deprive fame fide of the island, where he was joined by several ad-
him ot his
commillion, venturers, and received a supply of provisions and military

flores, of which his flock was still very incomplete. He had
hardly left St. Jago when the jealousy which had been work-
ing in the breafl of Velasquez, grew so violent that it was im-
possible to suppress it. The armament was no longer under
his own eye and direcion; and he felt that as his power over
it ceased, that of Cortes became more absolute. Imagination
now aggravated every circumstance, which had formerly ex-
cited suspicion: the rivals of Cortes industriously threw in re-
flecions which increased his fears; and with no less art than
malice they called fuperflition to their aid, employing the pre-
diCtions of an aftrologcr in order to complete the alarm. All
,there, by their united operation, produced the desired effect.

to Trinidad, empowering Verdugo, the chief magistrate there,
to deprive Cortes of his commission. But Cortes had already
made such progress in gaining the esteem and confidence of his
troops, that, finding officers as well as soldiers equally zealous
to support his authority, he soothed or intimidated Verdugo,
and was permitted to depart from Trinidad without mo-
leflation.

There several persons of diftindion entered into the service,
and engaged to supply what provisions were fill wanting; but
as it was necessary to allow them some time for performing
what they had prornifed, Velasquez, sensible that he ought no
longer to rely on a man of whom he had so openly discovered
his distrust, availed himself of the interval, which this un-
avoidable delay afforded, in order to make one attempt more to
wrest the command out of the hands of Cortes. He loudly
complained of Verdugo's conducl, accusing him either of
childifil facility, or of manifest treachery, in suffering Cortec
to cfcape from Trinidad. Anxious to guard againfl a fecondt
disappointment, lie fcnt a pcrobn of confidence to the l-ava-
na, with peremptory injunciions to Pedro Barba, his lieute-
nant-governor in that colony, inflantly to arrest Cortes, to

V. .-.--> a Franciscan friar of St. Jago had secretly conveyed an account
5L8. of this interesting tranfaaion to Bartholomew de Olmedo, a

monk of the fame order, who aaed as chaplain to the expe-
dition.

Cortes dc- CORTES, forewarned of the danger, had time to take pre-
feats his
schemes, and cautions for his own safety. His first flep was to find some
cpepiaraeos pretext for removing from the Havana Diego de Ordaz, an offi-

cer of great merit, but in whom, on account of his known
attachment to Velasquez, he could not confide in this trying
and delicate juncture. He gave him the command of a vessel,
destined to take on board some provisions in a finall harbour
beyond Cape Antonio, and thus made sure of his absence,
without teeming to fufpet his fidelity. When he was gone,
Cortes no longer concealed the intentions of Velasquez from
his troops; and as officers and soldiers were equally impatient
to set out on an expedition, in preparing for which moit of
them had expended all their fortune, they expressed their afto-
nilhment and indignation at that illiberal jealousy, to which
the governor was about to sacrifice, not only the honour of their
general, but all their sanguine hopes of glory and wealth.
With one voice they intreated that he would not abandon the
important station to which he had fuich a good title. They
conjured him not to deprive them of a leader whom they fol-
lowed with such well-founded confidence, and offered to flied
the last drop of their blood in maintaining his authority. Cortes
was easily induced to comply with what he so ardently desired.
He swore that he would never desert soldiers who had given
him such a signal proof of their attachment, and promised in-
fPantly to conduct them to that rich country, which had been

ration was received with transports of military applause, accom- t-
panied with threats and imprecations against all who should
presume to call in quefftion the jurifdiftion of their general, or
to obstruct the execution of his designs.

EVERY thing was now ready for their departure: but The amount

though this expedition was the united effort of the Spaniflh
power in Cuba; though every fettlenient had contributed its
quota of men and provisions; though the governor had laid
out considerable tums, and each adventurer had exhausted his
flock, or strained his credit, the poverty of the preparations
was such as muff astonish the present age, and bore, indeed, no
resemblance to an armament destined for the conquest of a
great empire. The fleet consisted of eleven vessels; the largelt
of a hundred tons, which was dignified with the name of Ad-
miral; three of seventy or eighty tons, and the reft small open
barks. On board of these were fix hundred and feventecn men;
of which five hundred and eight belonged to the land service,
and a hundred and nine were seamen or artificers. The fol-
diers were divided into eleven companies, according to the
number of the ships; to each of which Cortes appointed a cap-
tain, and committed to him the command of the vessel while
at sea, and of the men when on tforel. As the use of fire-
arms among the nations of Europe was hitherto confined to a
few battalions of regularly difciplincld infantry, only thirteen
soldiers were armed with muskets, thirty-two were cross-bow-
men, and the reft had swords and fpcars. Inftcad of the uflal

As religious enthusiasm always mingled with the spirit of ad-
venture in the New World, and, by a combination fiill more
firange, united with avarice, in prompting the Spaniards to all
their enterprises, a large cross was displayed in their flandards,
with this incfription, Let us follow the crof, for under this
Jigtn we hall conquer.

So powerfully were Cortes and his followers animated with

both these paflions, that no less eager to plunder the opulent
country whither they were bound, than zealous to propagate
the Christian faith among its inhabitants, they set out, not with
the solicitude natural to men going upon dangerous service, but
with that confidence which arises from fccurity of success, and
certainty of the divine protction.

I'ouches at As Cortes had determined to touch at every place which Gri-

the natives, from some unknown cause, was totally changed.
After repeated endeavours to conciliate their good-will, he was
constrained to have recourse to violence. Though the forces
of the enemy were numerous, and advanced with extraordinary
courage, they were routed, with great slaughter, in several
fuccefiive actions. The lots which they futfained, and flill
more the astonishment and terror excited by the deflruaive
effect of the fire-arms, and the dreadful appearance of the
horses, humbled their fierce spirits, and induced them to sue
for peace. They acknowledged the king of Caflile as their
fovercign, and granted Cortes a supply of provisions, with a
present of cotton garments, some gold, and twenty female
slaves'.

CORTES continued his course to the weflward, keeping as Arrives at

19 great schemes which he meditated, if, in his tranfadions with

the natives, he must depend entirely upon such an imperfet,
ambiguous, and conjectural mode of communication, as the
use of signs. But he did not remain long in this embarrassing
situation: a fortunate accident extricated him, when his own
sagacity could have contributed little towards his relief. One of
the female slaves, whom he had received from the cazique of
Tabasco, happened to be present at the first interview between
Cortes and his new gueits. She perceived his distress, as well
as the confusion of Aguilar; and as she perfectly understood
the Mexican language, ihe explained what they said in the
Yucatan tongue, with which Aguilar was acquainted. This
woman, known afterwards by the name of Donna Marina, and
who makes a conspicuous figure in the history of the New
World, where great revolutions were brought about by small
causes and inconsiderable infiruments, was born in one of the
provinces of the Mexican empire. Having been carried off a
captive by some hostile party, after a variety of adventures she
fell into the hands of the Tabafcans, and had resided long
enough among them to acquire their language, without losing
the use of her own. Though it was both tedious and trouble-
some to converse by the intervention of two different interpret-
ers, Cortes was so highly pleated with having discovered this
method of carrying on some intercotu-re with the people of a
country into which he was determined to penetrate, that. in
the transports of his joy he confidercd it as a visible intcrpofition
of Providence in his favour'.

mander of his forces there, and that they were sent to inquire
what his intentions were in visiting their coast, and to offer him
what assistance he might need, in order to continue his voyage.
Cortes, firuck with the appearance of those people, as well as
the tenor of the mefrage, assured them, in respectful terms,
that he approached their country with most friendly senti-
ments, and came to propose matters of great importance to the
welfare of their prince and his kingdom, which he would unfold
more fully, in person, to the governor and the general. Next
morning, without waiting for any answer, he landed his
troops, his horses and artillery; and having chosen proper
ground, began to ereac huts for his men, and to fortify his
camp. The natives, instead of opposing the entrance of those
fatal guests into their country, afifted them in all their opera-
tions, with an alacrity of which they had ere long good reason
to repent.

disagreeable, and which they foresaw might prove extremely
embarrafing to their sovereign, whose mind had been filled
with many disquieting apprehensions, ever iince the former
appearance of the Spaniards on his coafis. But before they
attempted to dissuade Cortes from insisting on this demand,
they endeavoured to conciliate his good-will, by entreating
him to accept of certain presents, which, as humble slaves of
Montezuma, they laid at his feet. These were introduced with
great parade, and consisted of fine cotton cloth, of plumes of
various colours, and of ornaments of gold and filvcr, to a con-
fiderable value; the workmanship of which appeared to be as
curious as the materials were rich. The display of there pro-
duced an efledt very different from what the Mexicans intended.
Instead of satisfying, it increased the avidity of the Spaniards,
and rendered them so eager and impatient to become matters of
a country which abounded with such precious productions, that
Cortes could hardly liften with patience to the arguments
which Pilpatoe and Teutile employed to dissuade him from vi-
fiting the capital, and in a haughty determined tone he insistcd
on his demand, of being admitted to a personal audience of their
sovereign. I)uring this interview, fbme painters, in tle train
of the Mexican chiefs, had been diligently employed in deli-
nlcating upon white cotton cloths, figurcs of the Ihips, thle horfcs,

could communicate, he resolved to render the representation
frill more animated and interesting, by exhibiting such a spec-
tacle as might give both them and their monarch an awful im-
pression of the extraordinary prowess of his followers, and the
irrefiflible force of their arms. The trumpets, by his order,
founded an alarm; the troops, in a moment, formed in order
of battle, the infantry performed such martial exercises as were
best suited to display the effec of their different weapons; the
horse, in various evolutions, gave a specimen of their agility
and firength; the artillery pointed towards the thick woods
which surrounded the camp, made dreadful havoc among the
trees. The Mexicans looked on with that silent amazement,
which is natural when the mind is struck with objects, which
are both awful and above its comprehension. But, at tile ex-
plosion of the cannon, many of them fled, some fell to the
ground, and all werc so much confounded at the fight of men
whose power so nearly refeimbled that of the Gods, that Cortes
found it difficult to compose and re-aflure them. The painters
had now many new fubjeclts on which to exercise their art, and
they put their fancy on the firctch in order to invent figures
and characers to represent the extraordinary things which they
had seen.

s'19g these were trained to agility by a regular education, and relieved

one another at moderate distances, they conveyed intelligence
with surprising rapidity. Though the capital in which Mon-
tezuma resided was above a hundred and eighty miles from St.
Juan de Ulua, Cortes's presents were carried thither, and an
answer to his demands was received in a few days. The fame
officers who had hitherto treated with the Spaniards, were em-
ployed to deliver this answer; but as they knew how repug-
nant the determination of their master was to all the schemes
and withes of the Spanish commander, they would not venture
to make it known until they had previously endeavoured to

negociation by introducing a train of a hundred Indians, loaded
with presents sent to him by Montezuma. The magnificence
of these was such as became a great monarch, and far exceeded
any idea which the Spaniards had hitherto formed of his wealth.
They were placed upon mats spread on the ground, in such
order, as shewed them to the greatest advantage. Cortes
and his officers viewed, with admiration, the various manufac-
tures of the country, cotton fluffs so fine, and of such delicate
texture as to resemble silk; pictures of animals, trees, and
otliher natural objects formed with feathers of different colours,
disposed and mingled with such flill and elegance, as to rival
the works of the pencil in' truth and beauty of imitation.

1 a haughty prince in possession of extensive power. The Mexi-

can empire at this period, was at a pitch of grandeur to which;
no ibciety ever attained in so short a period. Though it had
fubfibfled only a hundred and thirty years, its dominion extend-
ed from the North to the South Sea, over territories firetching
above five hundred leagues from east to weft, and more than.
two hundred from north to south, comprehending provinces
not inferior in fertility, population, and opulence to any in
the torrid zone. The people were warlike and enterprising.
The authority of the monarch unbounded, and his revenues
considerable. If, with the forces which might have been fud-
denly assembled in such an empire, Montezuma had fallen upon
the Spaniards while encamped on a barren unhealthy coast,
unsupported by any ally, without a place of retreat, and defti-
tute of provisions, it is impoflible, even with all the advantages
of their superior discipline and arms, that they could have flood
the shock, and they must either have perished in such. an une-
qual contest, or have abandoned the enterprise.

part, his own dispositions seemed naturally to prompt him to it.
Of all the princes who had swayed the Mexican sceptre, he was-
the most haughty, the molt violent, and the most impatientofcon-
troul. His fubjeas looked up to him with awe, and his enemies-
with terror. The former he governed with unexampled rigour,
but they were impressed with such an opinion of his capacity,
as commanded their refped; and by many victories over the
latter, he had spread far the dread of his arms, and had added

stead of taking such resolutions as the consciousness of his own Spaniafrds
power, or the memory of his former exploits, might have in-
spired, he deliberated with an anxiety and hesitation which
did not escape the notice of his meanest courtiers. The per-
plexity and discomposure of Montezuma's mind upon this oc-
cafion, as well as the general dismay of his fubjeas, were not
owing wholly to the impression which the Spaniards had made
by the novelty of their appearance and the terror of their arms.
Its origin may be traced up to a more remote source. There
was an opinion, if we may believe the earliest and most authen-
tic Spanish historians, almost universal among the Americans,
that some dreadful calamity was impending over their heads,
from a race of formidable invaders who fmould come from re-
gions to'wards the rising fun, to overrun and desolate their
country. Whether this disquieting apprchenlion flowed fiom
the memory of fomne natural calamity which had afflited that
part of the globe, and imprcfled the minds of the inhabitants
with fuperflitious fears and forebodings, or whether it was an
imagination accidentally fuggefled by the aftoniflment which
the first fight of a new race of men occasioned, it is irnpofible
to determine. But as the Mexicans were more prone to super-.
flition than any people in the New World, they were more

eg . the messenger arrived from the Spanifli camp with an account

that Cortes, adhering to his original demand, refused to obey
the order enjoining him to leave the country, Montezuma
assumed some degree of resolution, and in a transport of rage
natural to a fierce prince, unaccustomed to meet with any oppa-
fition to his will, he threatened to sacrifice those presumptuous
firangers to his gods. But his doubts and fears quickly re-
turned, and instead of ifluing orders to carry his threats into
execution, he again called his minifiers to confer and offer
their advice. Feeble and temporizing measures will always be
the result when men assemble to deliberate in a situation where
they ought to ad. The Mexican counsellors took no effectual
measure for expelling such troublesome intruders, and were fa,
tisfied with issuing a more positive injuncion, requiring them
to leave the country; but this they prepofferoufly accompanied
with a prcfent of such value, as proved a fresh inducement to
remain there.

of the country, that, despising danger or hardships, when -- -
they had in view treasures which appeared to be inexhaufi- '59'
ible, they were eager to attempt the conqucll. Others, efli-
mating the power of the Mexican empire by its wealth, and
enumerating the various proofs which had occurred of its being
under a well regulated administration, contended that it would
be an at of the wildest frenzy to attack such a slate with a small
body of men, in want of provisions, unconneted with any
ally, and already enfeebled by the diseases peculiar to the cli-
mate, and the loss of several of their number '. Cortes secretly
applauded the advocates for bold measures, and cherifled their
romantic hopes, as fIch ideas corresponded with his own, and
favoured the execution of the schemes which he had formed.
From the time that the suspicions of Velasquez broke out with
open violence in the attempts to deprive Cortes of the com-
mand, he saw the necessity of dissolving a connecion which Schemes of
would obflruc and embarrass all his operations, and watched Cortes.
for a proper opportunity of coming to a final rupture with
him. Having this in view, he had laboured by every art, to
fecurc the efceln and affei'ion of his soldiers. With his abi-
lities for command, it was easy to gain their enecm ; and his
followers were quickly satisficd that they might rely, with
perfea confidence, on the conduEc and courage of their leader.
Nor was it more difficult to ac(quire their afl'ccion. - Among
adventurers, nearly of the fame rank, and serving at their
own expence, the dignity of command did not elevate a gene-
ral above mingling with thole who aeccl under him. Cortes
availed himfclf of this freedom of intercourfc, to insinuate

HiTs address DuRING those intrigues, Teutile arrived with the present
in carrying
h c rlon. from Montezuma, and, together with it, delivered the ultimate

order of that monarch to depart instantly out of his dominions;
and when Cortes, instead of complying, renewed his request of
an audience, the Mexican turned from him abruptly, and quit-
ted the camp with looks and gestures which strongly expressed
his surprise and resentment. Next morning, none of the na-
tives, who uscd to frequent the camp in great numbers, in or-
der to barter with the soldiers, and to bring in provisions, ap-
peared. All friendly correspondence seemed now to beat an
end, and it was expeaed every moment that hostilities would
conmmence. This, though an event that might have been fore-
seen, occasioned a sudden conflernation among the Spaniards,
which cmboldcned the adherents of Velasquez not only to mur-
mur and cabal againfl their general, but to appoint one of their
number to rcmonflrate openly againtf his imprudence in at-
tempting the conquest of a mighty empire with such inadequate
force, and to urge the ncceffity of returning to Cuba, in order
to refit the flcct and augment the army. Diego de Ordaz, one

tion, and as he well knew the temper and wifhcs of his fol-
diers, and foresaw how they would receive a proposition fatal '51'9
at once to all the splendid hopes and £chemes which they had
been forming with such complacency, he carried his diffimula-
tion so far as to seem to relinquifs his own measures in com-
pliance with the request of Ordaz, and issued orders that the
army should be in readiness next day to reimbark for Cu-
ba. As soon as this was known, the disappointed adventurers
exclaimed and threatened; the emiflaries of Cortes, mingling
with them, inflamed their rage; the ferment became general;
the whole camp was almost in open mutiny; all demanding
with eagerness to fee their commander. Cortes was not flow
in appearing; when, with one voice, they exprefled their aflo-
nifhment and indignation at the orders which they had re-
ceived. It was unworthy, they cried, of the Cafiilian courage
to be daunted at the first afpe& of danger, and infamous to fly
before any enemy appeared. For their parts, they were deter-
mined not to relinquish an enterprise, that had hitherto been
successful, and which tended so visibly to spread the knowledge
of true religion, and to advance the glory and interest of their
country. Happy under his command, they would follow him
with alacrity through every danger, in quest of those fettle-
nents and treasures which he had so long held out to their
view; but if he chose rather to return to Cuba, and tamely
give up all his hopes of diftin&tion and opuleince to an envious
rival, they would instantly chufe another general to conduct
them in that path of glory which he had not spirit to enter.

CORTES, delighted with their ardour, took no offence at the
boldness with which it was uttered. The fentimients were what

' fctded, however, to be surprised at what he heard, declaring

that his orders to prepare for embarking were ifl'ued from a per-
suasion that this was agreeable to his troops; that, from defe-
rence to what he had been informed was their inclination, he
had sacrificed his own private opinion, which was firmly bent
on eflablilhing immediately a settlement on the sea-coast, and
then on endeavouring to penetrate into the interior part of the
country; that now he was convinced of his error; and as he
perceived that they were animated with the generous spirit
which breathed in every true Spaniard, he would resume, with
fresh ardour, his original plan of operation, and doubted not
to conduct them, in the career of vicory, to such independent
fortunes as their valour merited. Upon this declaration, shouts
of applause teflified the excess of their joy. The measure seemed
to be taken with unanimous content; fich as secretly con-
demned it, being obliged to join in the acclamations, partly to
conceal their difaffecaion from their general, and partly to avoid

men naturally transplant the inflitutions and forms of the
mother-country into their new icttlemcnts, this awas framed
upon the model of a Spanill corporation. 'Tle magif'ratcs

chosen were moil firmly devoted to Cortes, and the inlftlument --
of their eledion was framed in the king's name, without any s
mention of their dependance on Velasquez. The two prin-
ciples of avarice and enthufiafin, which prompted the Spaniards
to all their enterprises in the New World, seem to have con-
curred in suggesting the name which Cortes bestowed on his
infant settlement. He called it, Yilla rica de la vera Ciuz;

set an example of reverence for its authority, he began a long

observed, that as the fupremejurifdition over the colony which

the king's name, to command the army in its future opera-

part which he wilhed them to take. His resignation was ac-
cepted; and as the uninterrupted tenour of their prosperity

eleced him chief justice of the colony, and captain-general of

nor of Cuba, accepted of the commission, which vested in him
fupremejurifdiction, civil as well as military, over the colony,
with many professions of refpet to the council, and gratitude
to the army. Together with his new command, he assumed
greater dignity, and began to exercise more extensive powers.
Formerly he had felt himself to be only the deputy of a subjed ;
now he aced as the representative of his Sovereign. The ad-
herents of Velasquez, fully aware of what would be the effea
of this change in the situation of Cortes, could no longer con-
tinue silent and passive fpeatators of his actions. They exclaimed
openly againt the proceedings of the council as illegal, and against
those of the army as mutinous. Cortes, instantly perceiving
the necessity of giving a timely check to such seditious discourse
by rome vigorous measure, arrelted Ordaz, Efcudero, and Ve-
lafquez de Leon, the ringleaders of this faction, and rent them
prisoners aboard the fleet, loaded with chains. Their depend-
ants, altonifhed and overawed, remained quiet; and Cortes,
more desirous to reclaim than to punifl his prisoners, who
were officers of great merit, courted their friendship with such
assiduity and address, that the reconciliation was perftcly cor-

had hitherto remained, and advance into the country. To
this he was encouraged by an event no less fortunate than sea-
fonable. Some Indians having approached his camp in a myfte-
rious manner, were introduced into his preefnce. He found
that they were rent with a proffer of friendflip from the ca-
zique of Zempoalla, a considerable town at no great difance;
and from their answers to a variety of questions which he put
to them, according to his usual practice in every interview with
the people of the country, he gathered, that their master,
though subjeC to the Mexican empire, was impatient of the
yoke, and filled with such dread and hatred of Montezuma,
that nothing could be more acceptable to him than any profped
of deliverance from the oppression under which he groaned.
On hearing this, a ray of light and hope broke in upon the
mind of Cortes. He saw that the great empire which he in-
tended to attack was not united, nor its sovereign beloved. He
concluded, that the caufcs of difaffecion could not be confined
to one province, but that in other corners there muff be mal-
contents, so weary of fubjedtion, or so desirous of changg, as
to be ready to follow the standard of any prutecor. Full of
those ideas, on which he began to form a scheme, that time,

and more perfect information concerning the Itate of the coun- B °0 K
try, enabled him to mature, he gave a most gracious reception '----
to the Zempoallans, and promised soon to visit their cazique".

IN order to perform this promise, it was not necefTary to vary M;rcjhes to

the route which he had already fixed for his march. Some of- c"'l'"
ficers, whom he had employed to survey the coast, having dif-
covered a village named QOiabifan, about forty miles to the
northward, which, both on account of the fertility of the foil,
and commodiousness of the harbour, seemed to be a more pro-
per station for a settlement than that where he was encamped,
Cortes determined to remove thither. Zempoalla lay in his
way, where the cazique received him in the manner which he
had reason to expea; with gifts and carefles, like a man soli-
citous to gain his good-will; with rcfpca approaching almnolt
to adoration, like one who looked up to him as a deliverer.
From him he learned many particulars with refped to the cha-
raecr of Montezuma, and the circumftanccs which rendered
his dominion odious. H.e was a tyrant, as the cazique told him
with tears, haughty, cruel, and suspicious; who treated his
own filbjes with arrogance, ruined the conquered provinces
by exceflive exacaions, and often tore their sons and daughters
frofn them by violence; the former, to be offered as victims to
his gods; the latter, to be reservcd as concubines for himself or
favourites. Cortes, in reply to him, artfully inlinuated, that
one great objeca of the Spaniards in viliting a country so remlote
from their own, was to rcdrefs grievances, and to relieve the
opprcfed ; and having encouraged him to hope for this inter--
polition in due time, he continued his march to (Qiabillan.

protection, they ventured to insult the Mexican power, at the
very name of which they were accustomed to tremble. Some
of Montezuma's officers having appeared to levy the usual tri-
bute, and to demand a certain number of human viatims, as an
expiation for their guilt in prcruming to hold intercourse with
those strangers whom the emperor had commanded to leave-his
dominions, inflead of obeying the order, the caziques made them

threatened to sacrifice them to their gods. From this last dan- 519-
ger Lthey were delivered by the interposition of Cortes, who
manifested the utmost horror at the mention of such a decd.
The two caziques having now been pushed to an aa of such
open rebellion, as left them no hope of safety but in attaching
themselves inviolably to the Spaniards, they soon completed
their union with them, by formally acknowledging themselves
to be vassals of the fame monarch. Their example was fol-
lowed by the Totonaques, a fierce people who inhabited the
mountainous part of the country. They willingly fubjeded
themselves to the crown of Castile, and offered to accompany
Cortes, with all their forces, in his march towards MexicoY.

were such as would naturally prompt him to apply for redress
to their common sovereign; and such a representation, he forc-

B oo Ix but fulje(ccd to punishment. Before he began his march, it was
----.~ neeceilary to take the most efFeCtual precautions against this im-
19' 9 pending danger. \Vith this view, he persuaded the magistrates

·of liis colony to address a letter to the king, containing a long
account of their own ferviccs; a pompous dcfcription of the
country which they had discovered ; its riches, the number of
its inhabitants, their civilization and arts; a view of the pro-
grefs which they had already made, Fin annexing fceveral exten-
live provinces of it to the crown of Caffile, and of the fchcmes
which they had formed, as well as the hopes which they enter-
tained, of reducing the whole to fubjecQion; and last of all, they
gave a minute detail of the motives which had induced them
to renounce all conn-ecion with Velasquez, to fettle a colony
dependant upon the crown alone, and to velt the fuprcme
power, civil as well as military, in the hands of Cortes; hum-
bly requefling their sovereign to ratify what they had done by
his royal authority. Cortes limfelf wrote in a similar dtrain;
and as he knew that the Spanish court, accuflomed to the ex-
aggerated representations of every new country by'its disco-
verer, would give little credit to their splendid accounts of New
Spain, if these were not accompanied with such a specimen of
what it contained, as would excite an high idea of its opulence,
he solicited his soldiers to relinquihn what they might claim
as their part of the treasures which had hitherto been collected,
in order that the whole might be sent to the king. Such was
the ascendant which he had acquired over their minds, and such
their own romantic expectations of future wealth, that an
army of indigent and rapacious adventurers was capable ofthis
generous effort, and offered to their sovereign the richest pre-
sent that had hitherto been transmitted from the New World'.

WHILE a vefiel was preparing for their departure, an un- A conifpiracy

expeced event occasioned a general alarm. Some soldiers and le,
sailors, secretly attached to Velasquez, or intimidated at the
profpec of the dangers unavoidable in attempting to penetrate
into the heart of a great empire with such unequal force, formed
the design of seizing one of the brigantines, and making their
escape to Cuba, in order to give the governor such intelligence
as might enable him to intercept the ship which was to carry
the treasure and d4ispatches to Spain. This conspiracy, though
formed by persons of low rank, was conduced with profound
secrecy; but at the moment when every thing was ready for
execution, they were betrayed by one of their associates.

THOUGH the good fortune of Cortes interposed so sea- I-e defnroy.

fonably on this occasion, the detection of this conspiracy filled
his mind with most disquieting apprehensions, and prompted
him to execute a scheme which he had long revolved. He
perceived that the spirit of disaffection still lurked among
his troops; that though hitherto checked by the uniform
success of his schemes, or kept down by the hand of au-
thority, various events might occur which would encourage
and call it forth. He obfcrved, that many of his men, weary
of tlh fatigue of fcrvicc, longed to rcvifit their fcttlcmcnts
in Cuba; and tlat upon any appearance of extraordinaiy
danger, or any reverie of fortune, it would be impo(lible

B 0 0 K that his forces, already too feeble, could bear no diminution,

-_--,' and that a very finall defection of his followers would oblige
I''9' him to abandon the enterprise. After ruminating, often, and

with much solicitude, upon those particulars, he saw no hope
of success, but in cutting off all poffihility of retreat,, and re-
ducing his men to the necessity of adopting the fame resolution
with which he himself was animated, either to conquer or to
perilh. With this view, he determined to destroy his fleet;
but as he durst not venture to execute such a bold refolutibn by
his single authority, he laboured to bring his soldiers to adopt
his ideas with refpe& to the propriety of this measure. His
address in accomplishing this was not inferior to the arduous
occasion in which it was employed. He persuaded some, that
the ships had suffered so much by having been long at sea, as
to be altogether unfit for service; to others he pointed out
what a seasonable reinforcement of strength they would derive
from the juntion of an hundred men, now unprofitably em-
ployed as sailors; and to all he represented the necessity of
fixing their eyes and wishes upon what was before them, with-
out allowing the idea of a retreat once to enter their thoughts.
With universal content the ships were drawn afhorc, and after
stripping them of their fails, rigging, iron-works, and what-
ever else might be of use, they were broke in pieces. Thus,
from an effort of magnanimity, to which there is nothing pa-
rallel in hiflory, five hundred men voluntarily consented to be
shut up in a hollile country, filled with powerful and unknown
nations; and having precluded every means of escape, left
thclnfclvcs without any resource but their own valour and pcr-
fcverance `.

NOTHING now retarded Cortes; the alacrity of his troops B °0 K

and the disposition of his allies were equally favourable. All '---
the advantages, however, derived from the latter, though pro- '5'9
cured by much assiduity and address, were well-nigh loft in a
moment by an indiscreet sally of religious zeal, which, on
many oecafions, precipitated Cortes into acions inconfitent
with the prudence that diflinguifhes his character. Though
hitherto he had neither time nor opportunity to explain to the
natives the errors of their own superstition, or to inftruE them
in the principles of the Christian faith, he commanded his fol-
diers to overturn the altars and to destroy the idols in the chief
temple of Zempoalla, and in their place to ered a crucifix and
an image of the Virgin Mary. The people beheld this with
astonishment and horror; the priefis excited them to arms; but
such was the authority of Cortes, and so great the ascendant
which the Spaniards had acquired, that the commotion was ap-
peased without bloodshed, and concord perfectly re-established '.

CORTES began his march from Zempoalla on the sixteenth Advances

into tihe

of August, with five hundred men, fifteen horse, and fix field- co,,nt-r.
pieces. The reft of his troops, confifiinig chiefly of filch as
from age or infirmity were lets lit for adivc forvice, he left as
a garrison in Villa Rica, under the command of lf;alantc, an
officer of merit, and warmly attached to his i ntcrcft. The
caz7ique of Zempoalla supplicd him wvith provif(ionl, and with
two hundrcd of those Indianis called 'Tacmcs, w. hoc oillice, in
a country wvhcre tanme animals were unknown, was to carry
burdens, and pcrform all fcrvile labour. They wv'ert a grcat

B o o K not only to carry their own baggage, but to drag along the

.--,--. artillery by main force. He offered likewise a considerable body
'19' of his troops, but Cortes was satisfied with four hundred; tak-

ing care, however, to chufe persons of such note as might prove
hoflages for the fidelity of their mailer. Nothing memorable
happened in his progress, until he arrived on the confines of
Tlafcala. The inhabitants of that province, a warlike people,
were implacable enemies of the Mexicans, and had been united
in an ancient alliance with the caziques of Zempoalla. Though
less civilized than the fubjeas of Montezuma, they were ad-
vanced in improvement far beyond the rude nations of Ame-
rica, whose manners we have described. They had made con-
liderable progress in agriculture; they dwelt in large towns;
they were not itrangers to tome species of commerce; and in
theimperfeat accounts of their institutions and laws, tranfinitted
to us by the early Span.ish writers, we discern traces both of
difiributive justice and of criminal jurifdidion, in their interior
police. But still, as the degree of their civilization was incom-
plete, and as they depended for fubfiflence not on agriculture
alone, but trusted for it, in a great measure, to hunting, they
retained many of the qualities natural to men in this hlate.
Like them, they were fierce and revengeful; like them, too,
they were high-fpirited and indepcndant. In consequence of
the former, they were involved in perpetual hoflilitics, and
had but a slender and occalional intcrcourfe with neighbouring,
flates. The latter inspired them with such detellation of crivi-
tulc, that they not only refuecd to sloop to a forcign yoke, and
maintained an obflinatc and fucccfsfnl contest in dcfence of their
liberty against the superior power of the Mexican empire, but
they guarded with equal folicitudc againfl dominic tyranny;

CORTES, though he had received information concerning the His war 'ti

the lafc.--

martial characer of this people, flattered himself that his pro- lans.
fefions of delivering the oppressed from the tyranny of Mon-
tezuma, that their enmity to the Mexicans, and the example of
their ancient allies the Zempoallans, might induce them to
grant him a friendly reception. In order to dispose them to
this, four Zempoallans of great eminence were sent ambaffa-
dors, to request, in his name and in that of their cazique, that
they would permit the Spaniards to pars through the territories
of Tlafcala in their way to Mexico. But instead of the favour-
able answer which was expected, the Tlafcalans seized the am-
baffadors, and, without any regard to their public characer,
made preparations for sacrificing them to their gods. At the
fame time, they afie:mbled their troops, in order to oppose tlole
unknown invaders, if they should attempt to make their pafihgc
good by force of arms. Various motives concurred in precipi-
tating the Tlafcalans into this resolution. A fierce people, linut
up witlin its own narrow prccincLs, and little acctflomed to any
intercourse with foreigners, is apt to confider every firanger as
an enemy, and is ealily excited to arms. They conclukL'(l, frnil

'5 19 the smallness of their number, were objects of contempt; they

had not yet measured their own strength with those new ene-
mies, and had no idea of the superiority which they derived
from their arms and discipline.
Aug. 30. CORTES, after waiting some days, in vain, for the return

of his ambassadors, advanced into the Tlafcalan territories. As
the resolutions of people who delight in war are executed with
no less promptitude than they are formed, he found troops in
the field ready to oppose him. They attacked him with great
intrepidity, and in the first encounter, wounded some of the
Spaniards, and killed two horses; a loss, in their situation, of
great moment, because it was irreparable. From this specimen
of their courage, Cortes saw the neceflity of proceeding with
caution. His army marched in close order; he chore the
stations, where he halted with attention, and fortified every
camp with extraordinary care. During 'fourteen days he was
exposed to almost uninterrupted assaults, the Tlafcalans ad-
vancing with numerous armies, and renewing the attack in
various forms, with a degree of valour and perseverance to
which the Spaniards had fceni nothing parallel in the New
World. The Spaniih hilsorians dcfcribe those fucceilive battles

mingling many exaggerated and incredible circumltanccs ' with

characer both of the people of New Spain, and of their con-
querors. Though the Tlafcalans brought into the field such vas
armies as appear fufficicnt to have ovcrwhelmed the Spaniards,
they were never able to make any imprefion upon their finall
battalion. Singular as this may seem, it is not inexplicable.
The Tlafcalans, though addited to war, were, like all unpo-
lifhed nations, firangers to military order and discipline, and
loft all the advantage which they might have derived from their
numbers, and the impetuosity of their attack, by their constant
solicitude to carry off the dead and wounded. This point of
honour, founded on a fcntiment of tendcrnefs natural to the
human mind, and flrengthened by anxiety to preserve the bo-
dies of their countrymen from being devoured by their enemies,
was univei'fil among the people of New Spain. Attention to
this pious office occupied them, even during the heat of com-
bat', broke their union, and diminilhcd the force of the iin-
)prllion which tIhey might have made by ajoint effort.

NOT only was their fupcriority in number of little avail, but

the imperfeclion of their military weapons rendered their va-
lour in a great mcalfure inoffcnfive. After three battles, and
many flkimifles and aflaults, not one Spaniard was killed in

1'19' though deftrudive weapons among naked Indians, were easily

turned aside by the Spanish bucklers, and could hardly pene-
trate the efcaztpiles, or quilted jackets which the soldiers wore.
The Tlafcalans advanced boldly to the charge, and often fought
hand to hand. Many of the Spaniards were wounded, though
all slightly, which cannot be imputed to any want of courage
in their enemies, but to the defe0t of the arms with which they
assailed them.

NOTWITHSTANDING the fury with which the Tlafcalans at-

tacked the Spaniards, they seem to have conducted their hofti-
lities with some degree of barbarous generosity. They gave
the Spaniards warning of their hostile intentions, and as they
knew that their invaders wanted provisions, and imagined, per-
haps, like the other Americans, that they had left their own
country because it did not afford them subsistence, they sent to
their camp a large supply of poultry and maize, desiring them
to eat plentifully, because they scorned to attack an enemy en-
feebled by hunger, and it would be an affront to their Gods to
offer them famished victims, as well as disagreeable to them-
selves to feed on such emaciated prey '.

WHEN they were taught by the first encounter with their

new enemies, that it was not easy to execute this threat; when
they perceived, in the subsequent engagements, that notwith-
tanding all the efforts of their own valour, of which they had
a very high opinion, not one of the Spaniards was slain or

beings, againit whom human power could not avail. In this -----'
extremity, they had recourse to their priests, requiring them 19
to reveal the mysterious causes of such extraordinary events,
and to declare what new means they fliould employ in order to
repulse those formidable invaders. The priests, after many fa-
crifices and incantations, delivered this response. That there
firangers were the offspring of the fun, procreated by his.ani-
mating energy in the regions of the eail; that, by day, while
cherished with the influence of his parental beams, they were
invincible; but by night, when his reviving heat was with-
drawn, their vigour declined and faded like the herbs in the
field, and they dwindled down into mortal men . Theories
less plausible have gained credit with more enlightened nations,
and have influenced their conduct. In consequence of this, the
Tlafcalans, with the implicit confidence of men who fancy
themselves to be under the guidance of Heaven, acted in con-
tradition to one of their most established maxims in war, and
ventured to attack the enemy in the night-time, in hopes of
destroying them when enfeebled and surprised. But Cortes
had more vigilance and discernment than to be deceived by the
rude firatagems of an Indian army. The centinels at his out-
posts, observing some extraordinary movement among the Tlaf-
calans, gave the alarm. In a moment the troops were under
arms, and rallying out, dispersed the party with great flaugh-
ter, without allowing them to approach the camp. Convinced,
by fad experience, that their priefls had deluded them, and
satisfied that they attempted in vain, either to deceive or to
vanquish their enemies, the fiercencfs of the Tlafcalans abated,
and they began to incline seriously to peace.

teemed to favour each opinion. On the one hand, as the
Spaniards constantly difiniffed the prisoners whom they took,
not only without injury, but often with presents of Euro-
pean toys, and renewed their offers of peace after every vic-
tory; this lenity amazed people accuflomed to the extermi-
nating system of war known in America, who sacrificed and
devoured without mercy all the captives taken in battle, and
disposed them to entertain favourable sentiments of their hu-
manity. But, on the other hand, as Cortes had seized fifty
of their countrymen who brought provisions to his camp,
and supposing them to be spies, had cut off their hands h;
this bloody fpeaacle, added to the terror occasioned by the
fire-arms and horses, filled them with dreadful impressions of
their ferocity '. This uncertainty was apparent in the mode of
addressing the Spaniards. " If, said they, you are divinities
of a cruel and savage nature, we present to you five slaves, that
you may drink their blood and eat their flesh. If you are mild
deities, accept an offering of incense and variegated plumes.
If you are men, here is meat, and bread and fruit to nourish
you '." The peace which both parties now desired with equal
Concluded, ardour, was soon concluded. The Tlafcalans yielded them-

selves as vassals to the crown of Caflile, and engaged to assist
Cortes in all his future operations. He took the republic under
his protection, and promised to defend their persons and pof-
sessions from injury or violence.

THIS treaty was concluded at a seasonable junture for the B o o K

V.

Spaniards. The fatigue of service among a small body of men, --
surrounded by such a multitude of enemies, was incredible. Advantages
Half the army was on duty every night, and even they whose of it to the
turn it was to reft, slept always upon their arms, that they
might be ready to run to their posts on a moment's warning.
Many of them were wounded, a good number, and among
there Cortes himself, laboured under the distempers peculiar
to the climate, and several had died since they set out
from Vera Cruz. Notwithstanding the supplies which
they received from the Tlafcalans, they were often in
want of provisions, and so destitute of the necessaries most
requisite in dangerous service, that they had no salve to dress
their wounds, but what was composed with the fat of the In-
dians whom they had slain '. Worn out with such intolerable
toil and hardfliips, many of the soldiers began to murmur,
and when they refleted on the multitude and boldness of their
enemies, more were ready to despair. It required the utmost
exertion of Cortes's authority and address to check this spirit of
despondency in its progress, and to reanimate his followers with
their wonted sense of their own fuiperiority over the enemies
with whom they had to contend '". The fubmnilion of the Tlaf-
calans, and their own triumphant entry into the capital city,
where they were received with the reverence paid to beings of
a 1iipcrior order, banishcd, at once, from the minds of the
Spaniards all memory of past fuffcrings, dispelled every anxious
thought with rerped to their future operations, and fully lhtif-
sied them that there was not now any power in America able
to withfland their arms "

CORTES remained twenty days in Tlafcala, in order to allow

his troops a short interval of repose after such hard service.
During that time, he was employed in tranfations and inqui-
ries of great moment with refpea to his future fchemtes. In
his daily conferences with the Tlafcalan chiefs, he received in-
formation concerning every particular relative to the slate of
the Mexican empire, or to the qualities of its Sovereign, which
could be of use in regulating his condua, whether he should
be obliged to a&c as a friend or as an enemy. As he found
that the antipathy of his new allies to the Mexican nation was
no less implacable than had been represented, and perceived
what benefit he might derive from the aid of such powerful
confederates, he employed all his powers of insinuation in order
to gain their confidence. Nor was any extraordinary exertion
of these necessary. The Tlafcalans, with the levity of mind
natural tb unpolifhed men, were, of their own accord, disposed
to run from the extreme of hatred to that of fondness. Every
thing in the appearance and condut of their guests, was to
them matter of wonder . They gazed with admiration at
whatever the Spaniards did, and fancying them to be of
heavenly origin, were eager not only to comply with their de-
mands, but to anticipate their wishes. They offered, accord-
ingly, to accompany Cortes in his march to Mexico, with all
the forces of the republic, under the command of their molf
experienced captains.

BUT, after bellowing so much pains on cementing this

union, all the beneficial fruits of it were on the point of being
loft, by a new effusion of that intemperate zeal with which

Cortes was animated, no less than the other adventurers of the B 0 0 K

age. They all confidered themselves as infiruments employed - .----'
by Heaven to propagate the Christian faith, and the lets they
were qualified either by their knowledge or morals for i'ch a
fination, they were more eager to discharge it. The profound
veneration of the Tlafcalans for the Spaniards, having encou-
raged Cortes to explain to some of their chiefs the doctrines of
the Christian religion, and to insist that they fliould abandon
their own fuperflitions, and embrace the faith of their new
friends, they, according to an idea universal among barbarous
nations, readily acknowledged the truth and excellence of what
he taught; but contended, that the Teules of Tlafcala were di-
vinities no less than the God in whom the Spaniards believed;
and as that Being was intitled to the homage of Europeans, so
they were bound to revere the fame powers which their ancef-
tors had worshipped. Cortes continued, nevertheless, to urge
his demand in a tone of authority, mingling threats with his
arguments, until the Tlafcalans could bear it no longer, and
conjured him never to mention this again, left the gods fllould
avenge on their heads the guilt of having lillened to such a
proposition. Cortes, astonished and enraged at their obltinacy,
prepared to execute by force what he could not accomplish by
persuasion, and was going to overturn their altars, and cafl
down their idols with the fame violent hand as at Zempoalla,
if father Bartholemew de Olmedo, chaplain to the expedition,
had not checked his inconfidcrate impctuofity. He reprcfcnted
the imprudence of such an attempt in a large city newly re-
conciled, and filled with people no lcfs superstitious than war-
like; he declared that the proceeding at Zempoalla had always
appeared to him precipitate and unjust ; that religion was not
to be propagated by the sword, or infidels to be converted by

scenes, where a narrow-minded bigotry appears in such close
union with oppression and cruelty, sentiments so liberal and
humane tooth the mind with unexpeced pleasure; and at a
time, when the rights of conscience were little underRood in
the Chriflian world, and the idea of toleration unknown, one
is astonished to find a Spanish monk of the sixteenth cen-
tury among the first advocates against persecution, and in
behalf of religious liberty. The remonstrances of an ecclefi-
aftic, no less respectable for wisdom than virtue, had their pro-
per weight with Cortes. He left the Tlafcalans in the undif-
turbed exercise of their own rites, requiring only that they
{hould desist from their horrid practice of offering human vic-
tims in sacrifice.

Advances to CORTES, as soon as his troops were fit for service, resolved

earnest difluafives of the Tlafcalans, who represented his de-
ftrulion' as unavoidable, if he put himself in the power of a
prince so faithless and cruel as Montezuma. As he was ac-
companied by fix thousand Tlafcalans, he had now the com-
ca't. . mand of forces which resembled a regular army. They di-

recLed their course towards Clolula; Montezuma, who had at
length consented to admit the Spaniards into his presence, hav-
ing informed Cortes, that he had given orders for his friendly
reception there. Cholula was a coniiderable town, and though

empire. This was confidered by all the people of New Spain k_---
as a holy place, the sanctuary and chief feat of their gods, to 1519.
which pilgrims reolrted from every province, and a greater
number of human victims were offered in its principal temple
than even in that of Mexicoq. Montezuma 'eems to have in-
vited the Spaniards thither, either froin some fuperflitious hope
that the gods would not susser this sacred mansion to be defiled,
without pouring down their wrath upon those impious firangers,
who ventured to insult their power in the place of its peculiar
residence, or from A belief that he himself might there attempt
to cut them off with more certain success, under the immediate
proteCtion of his divinities.

He himself, though received into the town with much seeming

were encamped at some distance from the town, as the Cho-
lulans refused to admit their ancient enemies within its pre-
cinCts, having found means to enter in difguite, acquainted
Cortes, that they observed the women and children of the prin-
cipal citizens retiring in great hurry every night; and that fix
children had been tacrificed in the chief temple, a rite which
indicated the execution of ftme warlike entcrprifc to be alp-
proaching. At the fame time, Marina tie interpreter received

15'9. others, pits or deep trenches were dug, and slightly covered

over, as traps into which the horse might fall; that flones and
miflive weapons were collected on the tops of the temples,
with which to overwhelm the infantry; that the fatal hour was
now at hand, and their ruin unavoidable. Cortes, alarmed at
this concurring evidence, secretly arrested three of the chief
priests, and extorted from them a confelfion that confirmed the
intelligence which he had received. As not a moment was to
be loft, he instantly resolved to prevent his enemies, and to in-
flicL on them such dreadful vengeance as might firike Monte-
zuma and his fubjelts with terror. For this purpose, the Spa-
niards and Zempoallans were drawn up in a large court, which
had been allqtted for their quarters near the centre of the town;
the Tlafcalans had orders to advance; the magifsrates, and fe-
veral of the chief citizens, were sent for, under various pretexts,
and seized. On a signal given, the troops rushed out, and fell
upon the multitude, destitute of leaders, and so much afto-
nifhed, that the weapons dropping from their hands, they
flood motionless, and incapable of defence. While the Spa-
niards pressed them in front, the Tlafcalans attacked them in
the rear. The fireets were filled with bloodshed and death.
The temples, which afforded a retreat to the priests and rome
of the leading men, were set on fire, and they perished in the
flames. Tlhis scene of horror continued two days; during
which, the wretched inhabitants fuffcred all that the deftruitive
rage of the Spaniards, or the implacable revenge of their Indian
allies, could intliA. At length the carnage cealed, after the
.laughtcr of lix thousand Cholulans, without the loss of a single
Spaniard. Cortes then rcleafed the rnagiftrates, and reproach-

ing

ing them bitterly for their intended treachery, declared, that B 0 0 K
as justice was now appeased, he forgave the offence, but re- ,----
quired them to recal the citizens who had fled, and re-cftablifh 5'9
order in the town. Such was the ascendant which the Spa-
niards had acquired over this superstitious race of men, 'and
so deeply were they impressed with an opinion of their superior
discernment, as well as power, that, in obedience to this com-
mand, the city was in a few days filled again with people, who,
amidst the ruins of their sacred buildings, yielded refpetful
service to men whose hands were stained with the blood of their
relations and fellow-citizens r.

FROM Cholula, Cortes advanced directly towards Mexico, oa 29.

which was only twenty leagues diflant. In every place through wards Mexi-
which he passed, he was received as a person possessed of fuffi- co.
cient power to deliver the empire from the oppreflion under
which it groaned; and the caziques or governors, with the un-
reserved confidence reposed in superior beings, communicated
to him all the grievances which they felt under the tyrannical
government of Montezuma. When Cortes first observed the
feeds of discontent in the remote provinces of the empire,
hope dawned upon his mind; but when he now discovered such
symptoms of alienation from their monarch near the feat of go-
vernment, he concluded that the vital parts of the constitution
were affected, and conceived the most sanguine expctlations of
overturning a slate whose natural strength was thus divided and
impaired. While those reflections encouraged the general to
perifit in his arduous undertaking, the soldiers were no less
animated by observations more obvious to their capacity. In

served fertile and cultivated fields, stretching farther than the eye
could reach; when they saw a lake resembling the sea in extent,
encompassed with large towns, and difcovered,the capital city
rising upon an island in the mniddle, adorned with its temples
and turrets; the scene so far exceeded 'heir imagination, that
some believed the fanciful descriptions of romance were realized,
and that its enchanted palaces and gilded domes were presented
to their fight; others could hardly persuade themselves that
this wonderful spectacle was any thing more than a dream.
As they advanced, their doubts were removed, but their amaze-

was rich beyond any conception which they had formed of it,

sign of open hostility appeared, the Spaniards, without regarding B C0 K
the flucuations of Montezuma's sentiments, continued their
march along the causeway which led to Mexico tlrough the lake, 15 9
with great circumfpelEion and the flriActel discipline, though with-
out seeming to fuipet the prince whom they were about to viiit.

WH1EN they drew near the city, about a thousand persons, Hisi ,rflin-

who appeared to be of diftindtion, came forth to meet them, the Sp'a"
adorned with plumes, and clad in mantles of fine cotton. Each "iJar'.
of these, in his order, pafled by Cortes, and saluted him ac-
cording to the mode deemed most relfpeleful and fubmiflive in
their country. They announced the approach of Montezuma
himself, and soon after his harbingers came in fight. There
appeared first two hundred persons in an uniform dress, wih
large plumes of feathers, alike in fashion, marching two and
two, in deep silence, barefooted, with their eyes fixed on the
ground. These were followed by a company of higher rank,
in their molt showy apparel, in the midfc of whom was Mon-
tezuma, in a chair or litter richly ornamented with gold, and
feathers of various colours. Four of his principal favourites
carried him on their shoulders, others supportcd a canopy of
curious workmanflhip over his head. Before him marched
three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which they
lifted up on high at certain intervals, and at that signal all
the people bowed their heads, and hid their faces, as unwvor-
thy to look on lb great a monarch. WVhcn ice drew near,

B O O K not touch the ground. Cortes accosted him with profound

reverence, after the European fafhioni. He returned the 1a-
'5'9* lutation, according to the mode of his country, by touching

the earth with his hand, and then kissing it. This ceremony,
the customary exprellion of veneration from inferiors towards
those who were above them in rank, appeared such amazing
condescension in a proud monarch, who scarcely deigned to
confider the reft of mankind as of the fame species with himself,
that all his fubjeas firmly believed those persons, before whom
he humbled himself in this manner, to be something more than
human. Accordingly, as they marched through the crowd,
the Spaniards frequently, and with much fatisfadion, heard
themselves denominated Teules, or divinities. Nothing mate-
rial passed in this first interview. Montezuma conducled Cortes
to the quarters which he had prepared for his reception, and
immediately took leave of him, with a politeness not unworthy
of a court more refined. " You are now," fays he, " with
your brothers in your own house; rcfrefh yourselves after
your fatigue, and be happy until I return'." The place allot-
ted to the Spaniards for their lodging was a house built by the
father of Montezuma. It was surrounded by a fone-wall, with
towers at proper distances, which served for defence as well as
for ornament, and its apartments and courts were so large as
to accommodate both the Spaniards and their Indian allies.
The first care of Cortes was to take precautions for his security,
by planting the artillery so as to command the different avenues
which led to it, by appointing a large division of his troops to
be always on guard, and by polling ccntinels at proper flations,
with injunldions to observe the fame vigilant discipline as if they
were within fight of an enemy's camp.

suitable to the opulence of his kingdom. A long conference en-
sued, in which Cortes learned what was the opinion of Monte-
zuma with refpecl to the Spaniards. It was an eflablifhed tradi-
tion, he told him, among the Mexicans, that their ancestors came
originally from a remote region, and conquered the provinces now
subjet to his dominion ; that after they were fettled there, the
great captain who conducted this colony returned to his own
country, promising, that at some future period his descendants
should visit them, assume the government, and reform their con-
ftitution and laws; that, from what he had heard and seen of
Cortes and his followers, he was convinced that they were the
very pcrfions whose appearance the Mexican traditions and pro-
phecies taught them .o expcat; that accordingly he had received
them, not as strangers, but as relations of the fame blood and
parentage, and desired that they might confider themfclves as
masters in his domnirlions, for both himlelf and his fubjecs should
be ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their
wifhcs. Cortes made a reply in his usual flile with refpeL to
the dignity and power of hlis sovereign, antd his intention in
fending him into that counntry; artfully endeavouring so to
frame his discourse, that it miglht coincide as much as poflible
with the idea which Montezuma had formed concerning the
origin of the Spaniards. Next morning, Cortes and some of
his principal attendants xwere admitted to a public audience of
the emperor. The three fubiequcnt days were employed in
viewing the city; the appearance of which, lo far superior in
the order of its buildings and the number of its inhabitants to

lIErxico, or 7nlzzc/til/zn as it was anciently called by the

natives, is lituated in a large plain, environed by mountains
of such heighlt, that, though within the torrid zone, the tem-
perature of its climate is mild and healthful. All the moisture
which descends from the high grounds is collected in several
lakes, the two largefi of which, of about ninety miles in cir-
cuit, communicate with each other. The waters of the one
are frcfh, those of the other braclkif. On the banks of the
latter, and on some finall illands adjoining to them, the capital
of Mlontezuma's empire was built. The access to the city was
liy artificial oaulfevays or streets, formed of stones and earth,
about thirty feet in breadth. As the waters of the lake du-
ring the rainy season overflowed the flat country, these cause-
ways were of considerable length. That of Tacuba on the
weft extended a mile and a half; that of Tczeuco on the north-
vweft three miles; that of Cuoyacan towards the south fix
miles. On the east there was no caufcway, and the city could
be approached only by canoes". In each of these caureways
,'wre openings at proper intervals, through wvhich the waters
flowed; and over these beams of timber were laid, which
bcing covered with earth, the causeway or flreet had every-
nwhre an unilorm appearance. As the approaches to the city
A'were li ulalr, its conilr u lion w';as remlarlkable. Not only the

interfeeaed it in other quarters. In fcveral places were large
openings or fquarcs, one of which, allotted for the great market,
is said to have been to spacious, that forty or fifty thouiand
persons carried on traffic there. In this city, the pride of the
New WVorld, and the noblest monument of the indufiry and art
of man, while unacquainted with the ue of iron, and defritute
of aid from any domestic animal, the Spaniards, who are mofl
moderate in their computations, reckon that there were at leaif
sixty thousand inhabitants ".

BUT how much soever the novelty of those objects might Thelirdan-

bridges placed at certain intervals on the causeways, or by de-
stroying part of the causeways themselves, their retreat would be
rendered impracticable, and they must remain cooped up in the
centre of a hostile city, surrounded by multitudes sufficient to
overwhelm them, and without a possibility of receiving aid
from their allies. Montezuma had, indeed, received them with
distinguished refpec. But ought they to reckon upon this as
real, or to confider it as feigned ? Even if it were sincere,
could they promise on its continuance ? Their safety depended
upon the will of a monarch in whose attachment they had no
reason to confide; and an order flowing from his caprice, nr a
word uttered by him in passion, might decide irrevocably con-
cerning their fate .

Solicitude THESE reflections, so obvious as to occur to the meanest
and perplex-
ityofCorLe. soldier, did not escape the vigilant sagacity of their general.

Before he set out from Cholula, Cortes had received advice
from Villa Rica ", that Qualpopoca, one of the Mexican ge-
nerals on the frontiers, having aflembled an army in order to
attack some of the people whom the Spaniards had encouraged
to throw off the Mexican yoke, Efcalante had marched out with
part of the garrifbn to support his allies; that an engagement
had endied, in which, though the Spaniards were victorious,
llcailante, with ficven of his men, had been mortally wounded,
his horfc killed, and one Spaniard had been surrounded by the
enemy and taken alive; that the head of this unfortunate cap-

had been sent to Mexico b. Cortes, though alarmncd \vith this
intelligence, as an indication of Montezuma's hoflile intentions,
had continued his march. But as soon as he entered Mexico,
he became sensible, that, from an excess of confidence in the fu-
perior valour and difciplinc of his troops, as well as from the
disadvantage of having nothing to guide him in an unknown
country, but the defecdive intelligence which he received from
people with whom his mode of communication was very imper-
set, he had pursed forward into a situation, where it was dif-
ficult to continue, and from which it was dangerous to retire.
Disgrace, and perhaps ruin, was the certain consequence of at-
tempting the latter. The success of his enterprise depended
upon supporting the high opinion which the people of New
Spain had formed with refpet to the irrefitlible power of his
arms. Upon the firIt symptom of timidity on his part, their
veneration would cease, and Montezuma, whom fear alone re-
strained at present, would let loose upon him the whole force
of his empire. At the fame time, lie knew that the counte-
nance of his own sovereign was to be obtained only by a series
of victorics, and that nothing but the merit of extraordinary
success could screen his condua from the ccnfure of irregularity.
From all these considerations, it was necessary to maintain his
station, and to extricate himself out of the difficulties in which
one bold flep had involved him, by venturing upon another
fill bolder. The situation was trying, but his mind was equal
to it; and after revolving the matter with deep attention, he
fixed upon a plan no less extraordinary than daring. He de-

thi:. tfartled at a measure so audacious, and raised objections. The

more intelligent and resolute, conscious that it was the only
resource in which there appeared any prospect of safety, warmly
approved of it, and brought over their companions so cordially
to the fame opinion, that it was agreed inflantly to make the
attempt. At his usual hour of visiting Montezuma, Cortes
went to the palace, accompanied by Alvarado, Sandoval, Lugo,
Velasquez de Leon, and Davita, five of his principal officers,
and as many trusty soldiers. Thirty chosen men followed, not
in regular order, but sauntering at some diflance, as if they
had no object but curiosity; small parties were polled at proper
intervals, in all the fireets leading from the Sparnilh quarters to
the court; and the remainder of his troops, with the Tlascalan
allies, were under arms, ready to faJly out on the first alarm.
Cortes and his attendants were admitted without suspicion, ; the
Mexicans retiring, as usual, out of refpecd. He addressed the
monarch in a tone very different fiom that which he had em-
ployed in, former conferences, reproaching him bitterly as the

Well as for the insult offered to the great prince whose servants B OO K
they were. Montezuma, confounded at this unexpeced accu-
fation, and changing colour either from consciousness of guilt, '9'
or from feeling the indignity with which he was treated, as-
ferted his own innocence with great earnestness, and as a proof
of it, gave orders instantly to bring Qualpopoca and his accom-
plices prisoners to Mexico. Cortes replied, with seeming com-
plaifance, that a declaration so respectable left no doubt remain--
ing in his own mind, but that something niore was requisite to
satisfy his followers, who would never be convinced that Mon-
rezuma did not harbour hostile intentions against them, unless,
as an evidence of his confidence and attachment, he removed
from his own palace, and took up his residence in the Spanifll
quarters, where he should be served and honoured as became
a great monarch. The firfi mention of so firange a proposal
bereaved Montezuma of speech, and almofl of motion. At
length, indignation gave him utterance, and he haughtily an-
fwered, " That persons of his rank were not accuflomed volun-
tarily to give up themselves as prisoners, and were lie mean
enough to do so, his fubjcds would not permit such an afltront
to be offered to their fovcreign." Cortes, unwilling to employ
force, endeavoured altcrnately to soothe and to intiiidate him.
The altercation became warm; and having continued above

young man, exclaimed with impatience, ll \Vlly ,waln more

of the attempt, or the success of the execution; and were not
all the circumfiances of this extraordinary transaction authenti-

MONTEZUMA
Co

MONTEZUMA was received in the Spanish quarters with all B 0 0 K

the ceremonious refpe& which Cortes had promised. He was
attended by his own domeflics, and f:crvedl with his ufulal slate. Received
E-is principal officers had free access to him, and he carried on rWiheal'epa'ct
every funcion of governmecnt as if he had been at perfec liberty.
The Spaniards, however, watched hiin with the scrupulous
vigilance which was natural in guarding such an important
prize d, endeavouring at the fame time to tooth and reconcile
him to his situation, by every external demonflration of regard,
and attachment. But from captive princes the hour of humi-
liation and stiffering is never far distant. Qualpopoca, his son, suit;cedro
and five of the principal officers who servcd under him, were: ni-:e^.
brought prisoners to the capital, in conlequence of the.orders Dec. .,
which Montezuma had ifnued. The emperor gave them up toa
Cortes, that he might inquire into the nature of their crime,
and determine their punishment. They were formally. tried
by a Spanilh court-martial; and thoug1h they had acted no
other part than what became. loyal fubjcts and brave men, in
obeying the orders of their lawful sovereign, and in opposing
the invaders of their country, they were condemned to be burnt
alive. The execution of such atrocious deeds is seldom long
suspended. The unhappy victims were inflantly led forth.
The pile on which they were laid was cornpoed of the weapons
colleced in the royal magazine for, the public defencc. An
innumerable multitude of Mexicans belield, in filcnt aflonifll-
mcnt, the double insult ofl'ered to the majefly of their empire,
an officer of ditfindion committed to the flames by the autho-
rity of strangers, for having done what lie owed in duty to hisa
natural fovcrcign; and the arms provided by the forcfight of

BUT these were not the nmot shocking indignities which

the Mexicans had to bear. The Spaniards, convinced that
Qualpopoca would not have ventured to attack Efcalante with-
out orders from his master, were not satisfied with inflicting
vengeance on the instrument employed in committing that
crime, while the author of it escaped with impunity. Just
before QOalpopoca was led out to susser, Cortes entered the
apartment of Montezuma, followed by some of his officers, and
a soldier carrying a pair of fetters; and approaching the mo-
narch with a stern countenance, told him, that as the persons
who were now to undergo the punishment which they merited,
had charged him as the cause of the outrage committed, it was
necessary that he likewise should make atonement for that guilt;
then turning away abruptly, without waiting for a reply, com-
manded the soldier to clap the fetters on his legs. The orders
were instantly executed. The disconsolate monarch, trained
up with an idea that his person was sacred and inviolable, and
confidering this profanation of it as the prelude of immediate
death, broke out into loud lamentations and complaints. His
attendants, fpeechlels with horror, fell at his feet, bathing
them with their tears; and bearing up the fetters in their hands,
endccavoured with officious tenderness to lighten their prefflre.
Nor did their grief and despondency abate, until Cortes re-
turned fromn the execution with a cheerful countenance, and
ordered the fetters to be taken off. As Montczuma's spirits
had tunk with unmanly dcjecqion, they now role into indecent
joy; and with an unbecoming transition, lie pasld at once

IN those tranfarions, as represented by the Spaninl hillo- Reason, of

(Col te~'5

rians, we search in vain for the qualities which difiinguifh conduit.
other parts of Cortes's conduc. To usurp a jurifdidion which
could not belong to a stranger, who assumed no higher cha-
rater than that of an ambassador from a ,foreign prince, and,
under colour of it, to inflic a capital punishment on men whose
conduct entitled them to esteem, appears an act of barbarous
cruelty. To put the monarch of a great kingdom in irons,
and, after such ignominious treatment, suddenly to release him,
seems to be a display of power no less inconsiderate than wan-
ton. According to the common relation, no account can be
given either of the one action or the other, but that Cortes, in-
toxicated with success, and presuming on the ascendant which
he had acquired over the minds of the Mexicans, thought no-
thing too bold for him to undertake, or too dangerous to exe-
cute. But, in one view, these proceedings, however repug-
nant to jultice and humanity, may have flowed fiom that artful
policy which regulated every part of Cortes's behaviour. The
Mexicans had conceived the Spaniards to be an order of beings
superior to men. It was of the utmosl confcquence to chcrilh
this illusion, and to keep up the veneration it inspircd. Cortes
willhed that sledding the blood of a Spaniard should ble dlccmed
the most heinous of all crimes; and nothing appealred better
calculated to eflablifh this opinion, than to condemn the lirft:
Mexicans who had ventured to commit it, to a cruel death,
and to oblige their monarch himlelf to fiibmit to a mortifying
indignity, as an expiation for being accessary to their guilt'..

The poW5 r feelms accordingly to have made all the impression that he de-
X'^ ichCnitc fired. The spirit of Montezuma was not only overawed, but

12zo. j;fubdued. During fix months that Cortes remained in Mexico,

the monarch continued in the Spanifl quarters, with an ap-
pearance of as entire fatisfadion and tranquillity, as if he had
resided there not from confiraint, but through choice. His
'ministers and officers attended him as usual. He took cog-
nizance of all affairs; every order was ifluied in his name.
The external aspea of government appearing the fame, and
all its ancient forms being scrupulously observed, the people
were so little sensible of any change, that they obeyed the man-
dates of their monarch with the fame fubminiive reverence as
ever. Such wlas the dread which both Montezuma and his
fubjeas had of the Spaniards, or such the veneration in which
they held them, that no attempt was made to deliver their
sovereign from confinement; and though Cortes, relying on
this ascendant which he had acquired over their minds, permit-
ted him not only to visit his temples, but to make hunting ex-
curfions beyond the lake, a guard of a few Spaniards carried
with it such a terror as to intimidate the multitude, and secure
the captive monarch '.

THus, by the fortunate temerity of Cortes in seizing Mon-

tezuma, the Spaniards at once secured to thcmlflves more exten-
five authority in the Mexican empire than it was poflible to
have acquired in a long course of time by open force; and
they exercised more absolute sway in the name of another than
they could have done in their own. The arts of polishcd

the fame in every period. The system of screening a foreign ---
usurpation, under the fandion of authority derived from the 1;2"
natural rulers of a country, the device of employing the ma-
giftrates and forms already etfablithed as inllruments to intro-
duce a new dominion, of which we are apt to boast as sublime
refinements in policy peculiar to the prelient age, were inveln-
tions of a more early period, and had been tried with success in
the Weft, long before they were praailled in the Eafl.

CORTES availed himself to the utmofl of the power which Utc ,,,icii hec

he poffefled by means of this. He sent some Spaniards, whom r i.: i.
he judged best qualified for such commiflions, into different
parts of the empire, accompanied by perlbns of diftindion,
whom Montezuma appointed to attend them both as guides
and proteCtors. They visited nioft of the provinces, viewed
their foil and productions, surveyed with particular care the
distriCts which yielded gold or silver, pitched upon fcveral
places as proper fiations for future colonies, and endeavoured
to prepare the minds of the people for filrnbitting to the Spanifl
yoke. While they were thus employed, Cortes, in the namne

B o\0 K enabled him to accomplish. Having frequently entertained his
'----J. prisoner with pompous accounts of the European marine and

art of navigation, he awakened his curiosity to fee those moving
palaces which made their way through the water without oars.
Under pretext of gratifying this desire, Cortes persuaded him to
appoint some of his fubjets to fetch part of the naval stores de-
posited at Vera Cruz to Mexico, and to employ others in cutting
down and preparing timber. With their afiftance, the Spanish
carpenters soon completed two brigantines, which afforded a
frivolous amusement to the monarch, and were confidered by
Cortes as a certain resource, if he should be obliged to retire.

h'dies him- submission to.his will, Cortes ventured to put it to a proof till

a vassal of the king of Castile, to hold his crown of him as fu-
perior, and to subjea his dominions to the payment of an
annual tribute. With this requisition, the last and moss hum-
bling that can be made to one possessed of sovereign authority,
Montezuma was so obsequious as to comply. He called together
the chief men of his empire, and in a solemn harangue, remind-
ing them of the traditions and prophecies which led them to ex-
pctc the arrival of a people sprung from the amne flock with
themselves, in order to take poffeflion of the fuipreine power, he
declared his belief that the Spaniards were this promised race;
that therefore he recognized the right of their monarch to govern
the Mexican empire; that he would lay his crown at his feet,
and obey him as a tributary. While uttering thlfc words,
Montezuma discovered how deeply he was afllcccd in making
fucl a sacrifice. Tears and groans frequently intcrruptcd his
difcourfc. Overawed and broken as his spir'it was, it 11ill rctained

such a sense of dignity, as to feel that pang which pierces the B o O K

heart of princes when confrained to resign independent power.
The firit mention of such a resolution struck the assembly dumb 1520.
with aftonifllmenr. This was followed by a fullen murmur of
sorrow mingled with indignation, which indicated some violent
eruption of rage to be near at hand. This Cortes foresaw,
and seasonably interposed to prevent it, by declaring that his
master had no intention to deprive Montezuma of the royal
dignity, or to make any innovation upon the conflitution and
laws of the Mexican empire. This assurance, added to their
dread of the Spanilh power, and to the authority of their mo-
narch's example, extorted a relutant content from the assem-
bly g. The aQd of submission and homage was executed with
all the formalities which the Spaniards were pleased to pre-
scribe '.

very liberal contributions. The Spaniards now colleted all the
treasure which had been either voluntarily bellowed upon them
at different times by Montezuma, or had been extorted from his
people under various pretexts ; and having melted the gold and
filvcr, the value of there, without including jewels and ornaments
of various kinds, which were prcfervcd on account of their curious
workmanship, amount(ed to fix hundred thousand pcfos. The fol- Divfionnorir,

--. and by some of the officers, towards defraying the expence of

fitting out the armament, were then deduced. The remainder
was divided among the army, including the garrison of Vera
Cruz, in proportion to their different ranks. After so many
defalcations, the share of a private man did not exceed a hun-
dred pesos. This fum fell so far below their sanguine expec-
tations, that some soldiers rejected it with scorn, and others
murmured so loudly at this cruel disappointment of their hopes,
that it required all the address of Cortes, and no small exertion
of his liberality, to appease them. The complaints of the army
were not altogether deflitute of foundation. As the crown had
contributed nothing towards the equipment or success of the
armament, it was not without regret that the soldiers beheld it
sweep away so great a proportion of the treasure purchased by
their blood and toil. What fell to the share of their general
appeared, according to the ideas of wealth in the sixteenth cen-
tury, an enormous fum. Some of Cortes's favourites had fe-
cretly appropriated to their own use several ornaments of gold,.
which neither paid the royal fifth, nor were brought into ac-
count as part of the common stock. It was, however, so ma-
nifefily the interest of Cortes at this period to make a large
remittance to the king, that it is highly probable those conceal-
ments were not of great consequence.

derived from this circumstance, were no farther in request than I---
as they furnished materials for ornaments and trinkets. These Sz
were either consecrated to the gods in their temples, or were
worn as marks of distinCtion by their princes and some of their
most eminent chiefs. As the consumption of the precious me-
tals was inconsiderable, the demand for them was not such as
to put either the ingenuity or industry of the Mexicans on the
stretch, in order to augment their store. They were altogether
unacquainted with the art of working the rich mines with which
their country abounded. What gold they had was gathered in
the beds of rivers, native, and ripened into a pure metallic
slate'. The utmost effort of their labour in search of it was to
wash the earth carried down by torrents from the mountains,
and to pick out the grains of gold which iubfided; and even
this simple operation, according to the report of the persons
whom Cortes appointed to survey the provinces where there
was a profpet of finding mines, they performed very unfkil-
fully k. From all those causes, the whole mars of gold in pof-
session of the Mexicans was not great. As silver is rarely found
pure, and the Mexican art was too rude to condut the process
for refining it in a proper manner, tile quantity of this metal
was flill Icls considerable '. Thus, though the Spaniards had ex-
crted all the power which they polRefedl in Mlexico, and often
with indecent rapacity, in order to gratify their predomi naint
passion, and though Montezuma had iondly cxiauflcd his trca-
fures, in hopes of fitiating their thirll for gold, the produLo of
both, which probably included a great part of the bullion in tle

_----' with refpeEt to one point he was inflexible. Though Cortes

Montezuma often urged him, with the importunate zeal of a missionary,
in&lxible
with refpcx to renounce his false gods, and to embrace the Chriflian faith,
to re'lior. he always rejeaed the proposition with horror. Superflition,

among the Mexicans, was formed into such a regular and com-
plete system, that its institutions naturally took fafl hold of the'
mind; and while the rude tribes in other parts of America were
easily induced to relinquish a few notions and rites, so loose
and arbitrary as hardly to merit the name of a public religion,
the Mexicans adhered tenaciously to their mode of worship,
which, however barbarous, was accompanied with such order
and solemnity as to render it the objeCt of veneration. Cortes,
finding all his attempts ineffectual to shake the constancy of
Montezuma, was so much enraged at his obstinacy, that in a
transport of zeal he led out his soldiers to throw down the
idols in the great temple by force. But the priests taking arms
in defence of their altars, and the people crowding with great
ardour to support them, Cortes's prudence overruled his zeal,
and induced him to desist from his rash attempt, after diflodg-
ing the idols from one of the shrines, and placing in their stead
an image of the Virgin Mary ".

narch to attempt either the one or the other by violence, he - --
was willing to try more gentle means. Having called Cortes 1S20.
into his presence, he observed that now, as all the purpoles of his
embassy were fully accomplished, the gods had declared their
will, and the people signified their desire that he and his follow-
ers should instantly depart out of the empire. With this he re-
quired them to comply, or unavoidable deftru&ion would fall
suddenly on their heads. The tenor of this unexpeced requi-
fition, as well as the determined tone in which it was uttered,
left Cortes no room to doubt that it was the result of some deep
scheme concerted between Montezuma and his fubjecs. He
quickly perceived that he might derive more advantage from a
teeming compliance with the monarch's inclination, than from
an ill-timed attempt to change or to oppose it, and replied, with
great composure, that he had already begun to prepare for re-
turning to his own country; but as he had destroyed the vessels
in which he arrived, some time was requisite for building other
flips. This appeared reasonable. A number of Mexicans
were sent to Vera Cruz to cut down timber, and some Spanish
carpenters were appointed to superintend the work. Cortes
flattered himfclf that during this interval, he might either find
means to avert the threatened danger, or receive such reinforcc-
mcnts as would enable him to deipitc it.

ALMOST nine rmonths were clapsed since Portocarrero and Anxiety nj

Montcjo had failed with his dilp)atches to Spain; and he daily Corc:.
expeaed their return with a confirmation of his authority from
the king. Without tlis, his condition was insecure and pre-
rarious, and after all the great things which he had done, it
might be his doom to bear the name and susser the punifhmcnt

of

V. _.-._. could not hope to complete the reducqion of a great empire with
152C. so fmnall a body of men, which by this time the diseases of the

climate had considerably thinned; nor could he apply for re-
cruits to the Spanish settlements in the ifands until he received
the royal approbation of his proceedings.

The arrival WHILE he remained in this cruel situation, anxious about
of a new ar-
nla3iclr what was pail, uncertain with refpet to the future, and, by

the late declaration of Montezuma, oppressed with a new addi-
tion of cares, a Mexican courier arrived with an account of
iome ships having appeared on the coast. Cortes, with fond
credulity, imagining that his messengers were returned from
Spain, and that the completion of all his wifiles and hopes was
at hand, imparted the glad tidings to his companions, who re-
ceived them with transports of mutual gratulation. Their joy
was not of long continuance. A courier from Sandoval, whom
Cortes had appointed to succeed Efcalante in command at Vera
Cruz, brought certain information that the armament was fitted
out by Velasquez, governor of Cuba, and instead of bringing
the aid which they expeCted, threatened them with immediate
deftrudion.

Fitted out by TIIR motives which prompted Vclafqluez to this violent mea-
Vclzlueyz. ftre are obvious. From the circumflances of Cortes's dcpar-

ture, it was impoflible not to fufpea his intention of throwing
offt all dependence upon him. I-Iis neglclting to tranfinit any
account of his operations to Cuba, flrengthencd this fiililicion,
which was at las: confirmed, beyond doubt, by the indifcrction
of the officers whom Cortes fcnt to Spain. They, from fornme
motive, which is not clearly explained by the contemporary

hinforians,
72

historians, touched at the island of Cuba, contrary to the per- B O O K
emptory orders of their general °. By this means Velasquez .

-

not only learned that Cortes and his followers, after formally '5zo'
renouncing all connection with him, had eftablifled an inde-
pendent colony in New Spain, and were soliciting the king to
confirm.their proceedings by his authority; but, he obtained
particular information concerning the opulence of the country,
the valuable presents which Cortes.had received, and the invit-
ing, prosp,eCts of success that opened, to his view. Every pas-
sion which can agitate-an ambitious mind; lhame, at having been
so grossly overreached; indignation, at being betrayed by the
man whom he had feleded as the objec of his favour and con-
fidence; grief, for having wafted his fortune to aggrandize an
enemy; and.defpair of recovering so fair an opportunity of efla-
blifhing his fame and extending his power, now raged in the
bosom of Velasquez. All these, with united force, excited him
to make an extraordinary effort in order to be avenged on the
author of his wrongs, and to wrest from him his usurped autho-
rity and conquests. Nor did lie want the appearance of a good
title to juflify such an attempt. The agent whom he sent to
Spain with an account of Grijalva's voyage, had met with a
most favourable reception; and from the specimens which he
produced, such high expetations were formed concerning the
opulence of New Spain, that Velasquez was authorised to pro-
fecute the discovery of the country, and appointed governor of
it during life, with more extensive power and privileges than
had been granted to any adventurer from the time of Co-
lumbus ''. Elated by this diflinguifhing mark of favour, and

Naamazd of parations were such as might have been expeced from the vio-

lence of the passions with which he was animated; and in a
short time an armament was completed, consisting of eighteen
ships, which had on board fourscore horse-men, eight hun-
dred foot soldiers, of which eighty were musketeers, and a
hundred and twenty cross-bow men, together with a train of
twelve pieces of cannon. As Velasquez's experience of the
fatal consequence of committing to another what he ought to
have executed himself, had not rendered him more enterprif-
ing, he vested the command of this formidable body, which,
in the infancy of the Spanish power in America, merits the
appellation of an army, in Pamphilo de Narvaez, with inftruc-
tions to seize Cortes and his principal officers, to fend them pri-
foners to him, and then to complete the discovery and conquest

the difaffedion of his followers to be so general, as increased ,----
the natural confidence and presumption of Narvaez. His fir-t 1s0'
operation, however, might have taught him not to rely on
their partial accounts. Having sent to summon the governor
of Vera Cruz to surrender, Guevara, a priest whom he employ-
ed in that service, made the requisition with such insolence,
that Sandoval, an officer of high spirit, and zealously attached
to Cortes, instead of complying with his demands, seized him
and his attendants, and lent them in chains to Mexico.

CORTES received them not like enemies, but as friends, and Cortes deeply

alarmed.

condemning the severity of Sandoval, set them immediately at
liberty. By this well-timed clemency, seconded by caresses and
presents, he gained their confidence, and drew from them such
particulars concerning the force and intentions of Narvaez, as
gave him a view of the impending danger in its full extent.
He had not to contend now with half-naked Indians, no match
for him in war, and flill more inferior in the arts of policy,
but to take the field against an army in courage and martial
discipline equal to his own, in number far superior, adting un-
der the fandion of royal authority, and commanded by an
officer of known bravery. He was informed that Narvacz,
more solicitous to gratify the resentment of Velafqucz, than at-
tentive to the honour or interest of his country, had begun his
intercourse with the-natives, by representing him and his fol-
lowers as fugitives and outlaws, guilty of rcbellion againt tlheir

with the new commander, and seemed to court him as a person
superior in power and dignity to those Spa'niards whom he had
hitherto revered as the first of men ".

Iis delibera- SUCI were the various afpeas of danger and difficulty which
tions con-
cerninghis presented themselves to the view of Cortes. No situation can
own condua. be conceived more trying to the capacity and firmness of a ge-

neral, or where the choice of the plan which ought to be adopt-
ed was more difficult. If he should wait the approach of Nar-
vaez in Mexico, deltru&tion seemed to be unavoidable; for
while the Spaniards prefled him from without, the inhabitants,
whose turbulent spirit he could hardly restrain with all his
authority and attention, would eagerly lay hold on such a fa-
vourable opportunity of avenging all their wrongs. If he fmould
abandon the capital, set the captive monarch at liberty, and
inarch out to meet the enemy ; he mull at once forego thelfruits
of all his toils and vitorics, and relinquifl advantages which
could not be recovered without extraordinary efforts, and infi-
nite danger. If, instead of employing force, lie flould have

augmented 'by cohbcioufnefs of his present superiority, sorbad '>2'
him to cheri'ill ^any'faiguine hope of success. After revolving

tempting to adjust matters by an amicable negociation. In this
service he employed Oimedo, his chaplain, to whose characser
the funcion was well suited, and who possesed, besides, such
prudence and address as qualified him to carry on the secret
intrigues in which Cortes placed his chief confidence. Nar-
vacz rejeced, with scorn, every scheme of accommodation that
Olmedo proposcd, and was with difficulty rcflraincd fiom lay-
ing violent hands on himn and his attendants. HIe met, how-
ever, with a more favourable reception among the followers of

Cortes or his officers, their ancient friends and companions. Cor--

---- ---' Others, from public spirit, laboured to prevent a civil war,

1520. which, whatever party should prevail, must shake, and perhaps

subvert the Spanish power, in a country where it was so imper-
fectly established. Narvaez disregarded both, and by a public
proclamation denounced Cortes and his adherents rebels and
enemies to their country. Cortes, it is probable, was not much
surprised at the untracable arrogance of Narvaez; and, after
having given such a proof of his own pacific disposition as might
justify his recourse to other means, he determined to advance
towards an enemy whom he had laboured in vain to appease.
Marh-s I HE left a hundred and fifty men in the capital, under the

W"' ay. command of Pedro de Alvarado, an officer of distinguished cou-

rage, for whom the Mexicans had conceived a singular degree
of refpe&. To the cuflody of this slender garrison he commit-
ted a great city, with all the wealth he had amassed, and, what
was frill of greater importance, the person of the imprisoned mo-
narch. His utmost art was employed in concealing from Mon-
tezuma the real cause of his march. HIe laboured to persuade
him, that the strangers who had lately arrived were his friends
and fellow-fubjecs; and that, after a short interview with
them, they would depart together, and return to their own
country. The captive prince, unable to comprehend the de-
signs of the Spaniards, or to reconcile what he now heard with
the declarations of Narvaez, and afraid to discover any symptom
of suspicion or diftrufi of Cortcs, promised to remain quietly
in the Spanifl quarters, and to cultivate the fame friendship
with Alvarado which he had uniformly maintained with him.

principally upon the injunctions which he had given Alvarado

Sandoval and the garrison of Vera Cruz, did not exceed two
hundred and fifty men. As he hoped for success chiefly from
the rapidity of his motions, his troops were not encumbered
either with baggage or artillery. But as he dreaded extremely
the impression which the enemy might make with their cavalry,
he had provided against this danger with the foresight and fa-
gacity which distinguish a great commander. Having observed
that the Indians in the province of Chinantla used spears of ex-
traordinary length and force, he armed his soldiers with these,
and accustomed them to that deep and compact arrangement
which the use of this formidable weapon, the best perhaps tlhat
ever was invented for defence, enabled them to assume.

WITH this finall but firm battalion, Cortes advanced towards Continucs to

ncgociaie as

Zempoalla, of which Narvaez had taken possession. During he advanced.
his march, he made repeated attempts towards some accommo-
dation with his opponent. But Narvaez requiring that Cortcs
and his followers should inflantly recognize his title to be go-
vernor of New Spain, in virtue of the powers which he derived
from Velasquez, and Cortes refuting to submit to any autlo-
rity which was not founded on a commiflion from the crperor
himself, under whose immediate protection he and his adhe-
rents had placed their infant colony. All there attempts proved
fruitless. The intercourse, however, which this occasioned
between the two parties, proved of no finall advantage to Cortes,
as it afforded him an opportunity of gaining some of Narvaez's
officers by liberal-prefents, of softening others by a semblance

A- -- ' among his troops, most of his ibidiers having converted their
15ZC. share of the Mexican gold into chains, bracelets, and other or-

naments, which they displayed with military ostentation. Nar-
vaez and a little junto of his creatures excepted, all the army
leaned towards an accommodation with their countrymen.
This discovery of their inclination irritated his violent temper
almoit. to madness. Ina transport of rage, he set a price upo.n
the head of Cortes, and of his principal officers; and having
learned that he was now, advanced within a league of Zem-.
poalla. with his. small body; of men, he confidered this as an
insult which.merited immediate chastisement, and marched out.

on the opposite bank of the river de Canoas, where he knew
that-he could not: be attacked, he beheld the approach of the,
enemy without concern, and disregarded this vain bravade.
It was thenthe,beginning.of the wet season', and the rain had
poured down, during agreat part of the day, with the violence

customed to the hardships of military service, murmured so
much at being, thusfruitlefsly exposed, that, from their unfol-
dier-like impatience, as. well as. his own contempt of hs6 ad-
verfary, their general permitted them to retire to Zempoalla.

rans, though flanding under the torrents, which continued to B o o K
fall, without a single tent or any shelter whatsoever to cover k-
them, were so far from repining at hardlhips which were become ".
familiar to them, that they were fill fresh and alert for service.
He foresaw that the enemy would naturally give themselves up
to repose after their fatigue, and that, judging of the conduEt
of others by their own effeminacy, they would deem themselves
perfectly secure at a season so unfit for action. He resolved,
therefore, to fall upon them in the dead of night, when the
surprise and terror of this unexpected attack might more than
compensate the inferiority of his numbers. His soldiers, fen-
fible that no resource remained but in some desperate effort of
courage, approved of the measure with such warmth, that
Cortes, in a military oration which he addrcTfed to them before
they began their march, was more solicitous to tcmpcr than to
inflame their ardour. He divided them into three parties.
At the head of the firif he placed Sandoval; entrLuPing this gal-
lant officer with the molf dangerous and important fcrvice, that
of seizing the enemy's artillery, which was planted before the
principal tower of the temple, where Narvacz had fixed his
head-quarters. Chrifloval de Olid commanded the fccond, witl
orders to assault the tower, and lay hold on tlhe general. Cortes
himself conducdl the third and finalleft division, which was to
at as a body of refervc, and to support the other two as tlhcre
flould be occasion. Having pafled the river de Canoas, which
was much fvwelled witl the rains, not without liffciulty, the
water reaching almost to their cliins, they advanced in profound
Jilcnce, without bcat of drum, or found of any warlike inllru-
mcnt; each man armed wvithl his fvword, his dagger, and hlis
Chinantlan fpcar. Narvacz, remiss in proportion to his hicu-
rity, had polled only two ccntinels to watch tlh motions of an

2' made his escape, and hurrying to the town with all the pre-

cipitation of fear and zeal, gave such timely notice of the
enemy's approach, that there was full leisure to have prepared
for their reception. But, through the arrogance and infatua-
tion of Narvaez, this important interval was loft. He imputed
this alarm to the cowardice of the centinel, and treated with
derision the idea of being attacked by forces so unequal to his
own. The shouts of Cortes's soldiers, rufling on to the alfault,
convinced him at last, that the danger which he despised was
real. The rapidity with which they advanced was such, that
only one cannon could be fired, before Sandoval's party closed
with the enemy, drove them from their guns, and began to
force their way up the fleps of the tower. Narvaez, no less
brave in action than presumptuous in conducE, armed himself
in haste, and by his voice and example animated his men to the
combat. Olid advanced to sustain his companions ; and Cortes
himself, rufling to the front, conducted and added new vigour
to the attack. The compact order in which this small body
pressed on, and the impenetrable front which they presented

and over- with their long spears, bore down all opposition before it. They
Lomes im-. had now reached the gate, and were firuggling to burns it open,

when a soldier having set fire to the reeds with which the tower
was covered, compelled Narvaez to sally out. In the firif en-
counter he was wounded in the eye with a fpcar, and falling to
the ground, was cliagged down the ftcps, and in a moment clapt
in fetters. The cry of victory resoundcd among the troops of
Cortes. Those who had sallied out with their leader now main-
tained the conflict feebly, and began to surrender. Among the re-
inailnder of his foldicrs, flationcd in two inmaller towers of the

Their own artillery was pointed againll them. Wherever they 5O'
turned their eyes, they bhelld lights gleaming through the ob-
fcurity of night, which, though proceeding only from a variety
of ihining infeQs, that abound in moist and sultry climates,
their affrightcd imaginations reprcfented as numerous bands of
niufkcteers advancing with kindled matches to the attack. Ai--
ter a short refiflance, the soldiers compelled their officers to
capitulate, and before morning all laid down their arms, and
submitted quietly to their conquerors.

THIS complete victory proved more acceptable, as it was Theefleasof

gained almost without bloodfled, only two soldiers being killed this "ilory .
on the fde of Cortes, and two officers, with fifteen private men,
of the adverse faction. Cortes treated the vanquifled not like
enemies, but as countrymen and friends, and offered either to
fend them back diretly to Cuba, or to take them into his service,
as partners in his fortune, on equal terms with his own soldiers.
This latter proposition, seconded by a seasonable distribution of
some presents from Cortes, and liberal promiles of more, opened
profpecls so agreeable to the romantic expcetations which had
induced them to engage in this service, that all, a few partizans
of Narvaez excepted, closed with it, and vied with each other
in profcffions of fidelity and attachment to a general wlhofe re-
cent fuccels had given themn such a friking proof of his abili-
ties for command. Thus, by a series of events no lcMs for-
tunate than uncommon, Cortes not only cfcaped from perdition
which seemed inevitable, but, when he had leafl realon to ex-
peed it, was placed at the head of a tloufand Spaniards, ready
to follow wherever he should lead them. \Vhoever reflec'ts

M n upon

upon the facility with which this vitory was obtained, or con-
fiders with what sudden and unanimous transition the followers
of Narvaez ranged themselves under the standard of his rival,
will be apt to ascribe both events as much to the intrigues as
to the arms of Cortes, and cannot but fufpe& that the ruin of
Narvaez was occasioned, no less by the treachery of his own
followers, than by the valour of his enemy .

BUT, in one point, the prudent conduc and good fortune-

of Cortes were equally conspicuous. If, by the rapidity of his
operations after he began his march, he had not brought mat-
ters to such a speedy issue, even this decisive victory would
have come too late to have saved his companions whom he left
in Mexico. A few days after the discomfiture of Narvaez, a
courier arrived with an account that the Mexicans had taken
arms, and having seized and destroyed the two brigantines, which
Cortes had built in order to secure the command of the lake, had
attacked the Spaniards in their quarters, had killed several of
them and wounded more, had reduced to alhes their magazine
of provisions, and carried on hoflilities with such fury, that,
though Alvarado and his men defended thcmfelves with un-
daunted resolution, they muff either be soon cut off by famine,
or fink under the multitude of their enemies. This revolt was
excited by motives which rendered it fill more alarming. On
the departure of Cortes for Zclmpoalla, the Mexicans Ilattered
thcmfelves, that the long-expeIlccd opportunity of refloring
their bfvcrcign to liberty, and of viidlicating their country from
the odious dominion of firangers, was at length arrived; that
wliile the forces of their opprcllbrs were divided, and the arms

of one party turned againit the other, they might triumph with B 0 0°
greater facility over both. Consultations were held, and schemes ---
formed with this intention. The Spaniards in Mexico, con-
fcious of their own feebleness, suspected and dreaded those
machinations. Alvarado, though a gallant officer poffiefed
neither that extent of capacity, nor dignity of manners, by
which Cortes had acquired such an ascendant over the minds of
the Mexicans, as never allowed them to form ajuft eflimate of
his weakness or of their own strength. Alvarado knew no mode
of supporting his authority but force. Instead of employing
address to disconcert the plans or to sooth the spirits of the
Mexicans, he waited the return of one of their folcmn festivals,
when the principal persons in the empire were dancing, ac-
cording to custom, in the court of the great temple; he seized
all the avenues which led to it, and, allured partly by the rich.
ornaments which they wore in honour of their gods, and partly
by the facility of cutting off at once the authors of that con-
fpiracy which he dreaded, he fell upon them, unarmed and
unfufpicious of any danger, and massacred a great number,
none escaping but such as made their way over the battlements
of the temple. An aation Ib cruel and treacherous filled not
only the city, but the whole empire, with indignation and
rage. All called aloud for vengeance; and regardless of the
safety of their monarch, wh!os life was at the mercy of the
Spaniards, or of their own dli (nger in aflaulting an cneiy who
hlacl been so long the ol)jccl of their terror, they commnitted all
tlofe acrs of violence of whic Cortes received an account.

To hini the danger appeared so imminent, as to admit nci- cni mnrclhc

blck to lhec

ther of deliberation nor delay. He set out inflantly with all .lcfitl.
his forces, and returned from Zempoalla with no lcs rapidity

l 1ima

B °V0 K than he had advanced thither. At Tlafcala he was joined by
'- '- two thousand chosen warriors. On entering the Mexican ter-

15z0.

iitori-es, he found that dilaffeation to the Spaniards was not
confined to the capital. The principal inhabitants had deserted
-the towns through which he passed; no person of note appear-
ing to meet him with the usual respect; no provision was made
for the fubfiflence of his troops; and though he was permitted
to advance without opposition, the solitude and silence which
reigned in every place, and the horror with which the people
avoided all intercourse with him, discovered a deep-rooted an-
tipathy, that excited the most just alarm. But, implacable as
the enmity of the Mexicans was, they were so unacquainted
with the science of war, that they knew not how to take the
proper measures, cither for their own safety or the deflrudion
of the Spaniards. Uninflruatcd ly their former error in ad-
mitting a formidable enemy into their capital, inflead of break-
ing down the causeways and bridges, by which they might
have inclosed Alvarado and his party, and have effeCtually

to the city without molestation, and to take quiet pofiefiion of
his ancient flation.

were so much elated, the one with their seasonable deliverance,
and the other with the great exploits which they had atclhieved,
that this intoxication of success seems to have so far reached
Cortes himself, that he behaved on this occasion neither with
his usual sagacity nor attention. lle not only neglected to visit
Montezuma, but embittered the insult by expressions full of

the mask of moderation, under which he had hitherto concealed I5SZO
his designs. Some Mexicans who undcrllood the Spaniih lan-
guage, heard the contemptuous words which Cortes uttered,
and reporting them to their countrymen, kindled their rage
anew. They were now convinced that the intentions of the
general were equally bloody with those of Alvarado, and that
his original purpose in visiting their country, had not been, as
he pretended, to court the alliance of their sovereign, but to at-
tempt the conquest of his dominions. They resumed their arms The v7olent

a confidcrable body of Spaniards who were marching towards can"
the great square in which the public market was held, and
compelled them to retire with some lots. Emboldened by this
success, and delighted to find that their oppreflbrs were not in-
vincible, they advanced next day with extraordinary martial
pomp to afnault the Spaniards in their quarters. Their number
was formidable, and their undaunted courage still more io.
Though the artillery pointed against their numerous battalions,
crowded together in narrow flreets, swept off multitudes at every
discharge; though every blow of the Spanish weapons fell
with mnortal effet1t upon their naked bodies, the impetuolity of
the assault did not abate. Irelli men rufmed forward to occupy
the places of the slain, and meeting with the fame fate, were

VB o0 K CORTES beheld, with wonder, the implacable ferocity of a

*---J--' people, who seemed at first to submit tamely to the yoke, and
Di'rrefs of had continued so long palfive under it. The soldiers of Nar-
the Spa-
nial.dsa. vaez, who fondly imagined that they followed Cortes to ihare

in the spoils of a conquered empire, were astonished to find
that they were involved in a dangerous war, with an enemy
whose vigour was flill unbroken, and loudly execrated their
own weakness, in giving such easy credit to the delusive pro-
mises of their new leader . But surprise and complaints were
of no avail. Some immediate and extraordinary effort was re-
quifite to extricate themselves out of their present situation. As
soon as the approach of evening induced the Mexicans to retire,
in compliance with their national custom of ceasing from holtili-
ties with the setting fun, Cortes began to prepare for a sally,
with such a considerable force, as might either drive the ene-
my out of the city, or compel them to liften to terms of accom-
modation.

Cortes at- HE conduced, in person, the troops deflined for this im-
tacks them
without fuc- portant service. Every invention known in the European art

of war, as well as every precaution, suggested by his long ac-
quaintance with the Indian mode of fighting, were employed to
cnfure fiuccefs. But he found an enemy prepared and deter-
mined to oppose him. The force of the Mexicans was greatly
augmented by fresh troops, which poured in continually from
the country, and their animosity was in no degree abated.
They were led by their nobles, inflamed by the exhortations of
their priests, and fought in defence of their temples and fami-
lies, under the eye of their gods, and in presence of their wives

and

and children. Notwithstanding their numbers, and enthufi- B 0 K
aflic contempt of danger and death, wherever the Spaniards '----
could close with them, the superiority of their diScipline and
arms obliged the Mexicans to give way. But in narrow streets,
and where many of the bridges or communication were broken
down, the Spaniards could seldom come to a fair rencounter
with the enemy, and as they advanced, were exposcd to sower-s
of arrows and stones from the tops of the houses. After a day
of inceflant exertion, though vafi numbers of the Mexicans fell,
and part of the city was burnt, the Spaniards, weary with the
slaughter, and harassed by multitudes whicl fuccellively reliev-
ed each other, were obliged at length to retire, with the morti-
fication of having accomplished nothing so decisive as to com-
penfate the unusual calamity of twelve soldiers killed, and above
sixty wounded. Another sally, made with greater force, was
not more effecqual, and in it the general himself was wounded
in the hand.

CORTEs now perceived, too late, the fatal error into which Mr,,<,,nma

he had been betrayed by his own contempt of the Mexicans, ai
and was satisficd that he could neither maintain his present fla-
tion in the centre of an hofile city, nor retire from it without
the mofn imminent danger. One rcfource flill remained, to
try what effect the interpotition of Montczuml a might have to
tooth or overaw his fubjccds. When the Mexicans approached

J'20. long been accustomed to honour, and almoil to revere as a god,

the weapons dropt from their hands, every tongue was silent,
all bowed their heads, and many profirated themselves on the
ground. Montezuma addressed them with every argument that
could mitigate their rage, or persuade them to cease from hofti-
lities. When he ended his discourse, a fullen murmur of difap-
probation run through the ranks; to this succeeded reproaches
and threats; and the fury of the multitude riling in a moment
above every restraint of decency or refpet, flights of arrows and
volleys of stones poured in so violently upon the ramparts, that
before the Spanith soldiers, appointed to cover Montezuma
with their bucklers, had time to lift them in his defence, two
arrows wounded the unhappy monarch, and the blow of a stone
on his temple struck him to the ground. On secing him fall,
the Mexicans were so much aftonilhed, that, with a transition
not uncommon to popular tumults, they pafiecd in a moment
from one extreme to the other, remorse succeeded to insult, and
they fled with horror, as if the vengeance of Hleaven were pur-
suing the crime which they had committed. The Spaniards,
without molestation, carried Montezuma to his apartments,
and Cortes haflened thither to console him under his misfortune.
But the unhappy monarch now perceived how low he was funk,
and the haughty spirit which leemed to have been Io long ex-
tin't, rcturning, he scorned to survive this last humiliation, aid
to protraLt an ignominious life, not only as the priobner and
tool of his enemies, but as the objct of contempt or letefla-
tion among his fubijcas. In a tranlfort of rage he tore tih
bandages from his wounds, and rcfufil, w\ith such obilinacy,
to take any nourillhmcnt, that he soon ended his wretched days,

I5ZO.

UPON the death of Montezuma, Cortes having loft all hope Nev con-

of bringing the Miexicans to an accommodation, saw no pro- fas.
spect of safety but in attempting a retreat, and began to prepare
for it. But a sudden motion of the Mexicans engaged him in
new conflicts. They took poffeflion of a high tower in the
great temple which overlooked the Spanish quarters, and plac-
ing there a garrison of their principal warriors, not a Spaniard
could stir without being exposed to their miiffle weapons.
From this polf it was necessary to dislodge them at any risk,
and Juan de Efcobar, with a numerous detachment of chosen
soldiers, was ordered to make the attack. But Efcobar, though
a gallant officer, and at the head of troops accuflomed to con-
quer, and who now fought under the eyes of their country-
men, was thrice repulsed. Cortes, sensible that not only the
reputation but the safety of his army depended on the success
of this afrault, ordered a buckler to be tied to his arm, as he
could not manage it with his wounded hand, and rufled with
his drawn sword into the thickest of the combatants. Encou-
raged by the pretence of their general, the Spaniards returned to
the charge with such vigour, that they gradually forced their
way up the fleps, and drove the Mexicans to the platform at
the top of the tower. There a dreadful carnage began, when
two young Mexicans of high rank, observing Cortes as lie ani-
matcd his soldiers by his voice and example, resolvcd to facri-
fice their own lives in order to cut off the author of all tle
calamities which desolated their country. They approached
him in a iupplicant pollurc, as if they had intcnded to lay
down their arms, anld lfizing lhii in a momient, liuricd hIint

' 2oJ. pieces by the fame fall. But Cortes, by his strength and agility,

broke loose from their grasp, and the gallant youths perished
in this generous, though unsuccessful, attempt to save their
country. As soon as the Spaniards became masters of the
tower, they set fire to it, and without farther molestation, con-
tinued the preparations for their retreat.

The Spani- THIS became the more necessary, as the Mexicans were so
ards abandon
the city. much astonished at the last effort of the Spanish valour, that

they began to change their whole system of hoflility, and in-
stead of incessant attacks, endeavoured, by barricading the
streets, and breaking down the causeways, to cut off the com-
munication of the Spaniards with the continent, and thus to
flarve an enemy whom they could not subdue. The firfi point
to be determined by Cortes and his followers, was whether they
should march out openly in the face of day, when they could dif-
cern every danger, and fee how to regulate their own motions,
as well as how to refint the amaults of the enemy; or whether
they should endeavour to retire secretly in the night. The lat-
ter was preferred, partly from hopes that their national super-
flition would restrain the Mexicans from venturing to attack them
in the night, and partly from their own fond belief in the pre-
dicions of a private soldier, who having acquired universal credit
by a finattering of learning, and his pretensions to aftrolocgy,
boldly assured them of success, if they made their retreat in this
manner. They began to move, towards midnight, in three divi-
sions. Sandoval led the van; Pedro Alvarado, and Vclafquez
de Leon, had the conduCt of the rear; and Cortes commanded
in the centre, where he placed the prisoners, among whom

several Mexicans of diflintion, the artillery, the baggage, and ----
a portable bridge of timber, intended to be laid over the *5?z'
breaches of the causeway. They marched in profound silence
along the causeway which led to Tacuba, because it was shorter
than any of the reit, and, lying most remote from the road to-
wards Tlafcala and the sea-coast, had been left more entire by
the Mexicans. They reached the firt breach in it without
molestation, hoping that their retreat was undiscovered.

BUT the Mexicans, unperceived, had not only watched all Attacked by
their motions with attention, but had made proper dispositions the Mexi-

cans.

for a most formidable attack. While the Spaniards were intent
upon placing their bridge in the breach, and occupied in con-
ducting their horses and artillery along it, they were suddenly
alarmed with the tremendous found of warlike instruments,
and a general shout from an innumerable multitude of enemies;
the lake was covered with canoes; flights of arrows, and showers
of stones poured in upon them from every quarter; the Mexi-
cans rushing forward to the charge with fearless impetuosity,
as if they hoped in that moment to be avenged for all their
wrongs. Unfortunately the wooden-bridge, by the weight of
the artillery, was wedged so fanl into the floncs and mud, that
it was impossible to remove it. Difinayed at this accident, the
Spaniards advanced with precipitation towards the Iccond
breach. The Mexicans hemmed them in on every fide, and
though they defended themfclves with their ufial courage, yet
crouded together as they were on a narrow caufcway, their dif-
cipline and military tkill were of little avail, nor did the oblcu-
rity of the night permit them to derive great advantage from
their fire-arms, or the fupcriority of their other weapons. All

B o0 K Mexico was now in arms, and so eager were the people on the de-

V. _---.... firuaion of their oppressors, that they who were not near enough

'520. to annoy them in person, impatient of the delay, pressed forward

with such ardour, as drove on their countrymen in the front with
irrefiflible violence. Fresh warriors instantly filled the place of
such as fell. The Spaniards, weary with slaughter, and un-
able to sustain the weight of the torrent that poured in upon
them, began to give way. In a moment the confusion was
universal; horse and foot, officers and soldiers, friends and
enemies, were mingled together; and while all fouglt, and
many fell, they could hardly distinguish from what hand the
blow came.

Their dif- CORTES, with about a hundred foot soldiers and a few horse,
alters,

forced his way over the two remaining breaches in the cause-
way, the bodies of the dead serving to fill up the chafns, and
reached the main land. Having formed them as soon as they
arrived, he returned with such as were yet capable of service,
to assist his friends in their retreat, and to encourage them, by
his pretence and example, to persevere in the efforts requisite
to effect it. He met with part of his soldiers, who had broke
through the enemy, but found many more overwhelmed by
the multitude of their aggreflbrs, or perishing in the lake; and
heard the piteous lamentations of others, whom the Mexicans,
having taken alive, were carrying off in triumph to be facri-
liced to the god of war. Before day, all who had efcapedcaf-

party of his kinsman, the governor of Cuba, to follow the for-
tune of his companions, was, on that account, as well as for
his superior merit, refpeaed by them as the second person in
the army. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage, were
loft; the greater part of the horses, and above two thousand
Tlafcalans, were killed, and only a very finall portion of the
treasure which they had amafled was saved. This, which had
been always their chief objct, proved a great cause of their
calamity; for many of the loldiers having so overloaded them-
fclves with bars of gold as rendered them unfit for ation, and
retarded their flight, fell, ignominiously, the vicims of their
own inconsiderate avarice. Amidif so many disasters, it was

15,20- temple situated on an eminence, took possession of it. There

he found not only the shelter for which he wished, but, what
was no less wanted, some provisions to refrelh his men; and
though the enemy did not intermit their attacks throughout the
day, they were with little difficulty prevented from making any
impression. During this time Cortes was engaged in deep con-
fultation with his officers, concerning the route which they
ought to take in their retreat. They were now on the weft
fide of the lake. Tlafcala, the only place where they could
hope for a friendly reception, lay about fixty-four miles to the
east of Mexico'; so that they were obliged to..go round the
north end of the lake before they could fall into the road which
led thither. 'A Tlafcalan soldier undertook to be their guide,
and conducted them through a country in some places marshy,
in others mountainous, in all ill-cultivated and thinly peopled.
They marched for fix days with little respite, and under con-
tinual alarms, numerous bodies of the Mexicans hovering around
them, Sometimes harassing them at a distance with their mif-
file weapons, and sometimes attacking them closely in front, in
rear, in flank, with great boldness, as they now knew that they
were not invincible. Nor were the fatigue and danger of those
inceflant conflicts the worst evils to which they were exposed.
As the barren country through which they pasTed afforded hardly
any provisions, they were reduced to feed on berries, rgots,
and the flalks of green maize; and at the very time that famine
was depressing their spirits and wafling their strength, their
situation required the mos vigorous and unremitting exertions
of courage and activity. Amidst those complicated difireffcs,

one circumstance supported and animated the Spaniards. Their E °0 K
commander sustained this fad reverse of fortune with unfhakecni
magnanimity. His pretence of mind never forsook him; his i,'0.
sagacity foresaw every event, and his vigilance provided for it.
He was foremost in every danger, and endured every hardship
with cheerfulness. The difficulties with which le was fur-
rounded seemed to call forth new talents; and his soldiers,
though despairing themselves, continued to follow him with
increasing confidence in his abilities.

ON the sixth day they arrived near to Otumba, not far fiom the Battle of O-

road between Mexico and Tlafcala. Early next morning they
began to advance towards it, flying parties of the enemy still
hanging on their rear; and amidf the insults with which they
accompanied their hostilities, Marina remarked that they often
exclaimed with exultation, " Go on, robbers; go to the place
where you shall quickly meet the vengeance due to your
crimes." The meaning of this threat the Spaniards did not com-
prehend, until they reached the summit of an eminence before
them. There a spacious valley opened to their view, covered
with a vast army, extending as far as the eye could reach.
The Mexicans, while with one body of their troops they ha-
raffed the Spaniards in 'their retreat, had assembled their prin-
cipal force on the other fide of the lake; and marching along
the road which led diredly to Tlafcala, polled it in the plain
of Otumba, through which they knew Cortes must pass. At
the fight of this incredible multitude, which they could fur-
vey at once from the rising ground, the Spaniards were aflo-
nifhed, and even the boldest began to despair. But Cortes,
without allowing leisure for their fears to acquire flrength by
reflceion, after warning them briefly that no alternative now

B 0 0 K remained but to conquer or to die, led them instantly to the

V.
-_ ---. charge. The Mexicans waited their approach with unusual forti-
15-. ' tude. Such, however, was the superiority of the Spanish difci-

pline and arms, that the impression of this small body was irre-
fiftible; and whichever way its force was direced, it penetrated
and dispersed the most numerous battalions. But while these
gave way in one quarter, new combatants advanced from an-
other, and the Spaniards, though successful in every attack,
were ready to fink under those repeated efforts, without feeing
any end of their toil, or any hope of victory. At that time
Cortes observed the great fandard of the empire, which was
carried before the Mexican general, advancing; and fortunately
recollecting to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the
event of every battle, he aflembled a few of his bravest officers,
whose horses were still capable of service, and placing himself
at their head, pushed forward towards the standard with an
impetuosity which bore down every thing before it. A chosen
body of nobles, who guarded the standard, made some resist-
ance, but were soon broken. Cortes, with a firoke of his lance,
wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the ground.
One of the Spanish officers alighting, put an end to his life,
and laid hold of the imperial standard. The moment that their
leader fell, and the fRandard, towards which all direced their
eyes, disappeared, an universal panic ftruek the Mexicans, and,
as if the bond which held them together had been dissolved,
every ensign was lowered, each soldier threw away his wea-
pons, and all fled with precipitation to the mountains., The
Spaniards, unable to pursue them far, returned to colleCt the
spoils of the field, which were so valuable as to be some com-
penfation for the wealth which they had loft in Mexico; for in
tace enemy's army were most of their principal warriors, drefled

out solicitude, as they were still uncertain what reception they
might meet with from allies, to whom they returned in a con-
dition very different from that in which they had lately set out
from their dominions. Happily for them, the enmity of the
Tlafcalans to the Mexican name was so inveterate, their desire
to avenge the death of their countrymen so vehement, and
the ascendant which Cortes had acquired over the chiefs of the
republic so complete, that, far from entertaining a thought of
taking any advantage of the distressed situation in which they
beheld the Spaniards, they received them with a tenderness and
cordiality which quickly diflipated all their suspicions.

such a long fucceflion of fatigue and hardflips. During this,
Cortes learned that he and his companions were not the only
Spaniards, who had felt the effets of the Mexican enmity. A
considerable detachment, which was marching from Zempoalla
towards the capital, had been cut off by the people of Tcpeaca.

--- surprised and destroyed in the mountains. At a junture when
15 O. the life of every Spaniard was of importance, fuchl losses were

deeply felt. The schemes which Cortes was 'editating ren-
dered them peculiarly afflictive to him. While his enemies,
and even many of his own followers, confidered the disasters
which had befallen him as fatal to the progress of his arms,
and imagined that nothing now remained but speedily to
abandon a country which he had invaded with unequal force,
his mind, as eminent for perseverance as for enterprise, was
flill bent on accomplishing his original purpose, of subject-
ing the Mexican empire to the crown of Caflile. Severe and
unexpected as the check was which he had received, it did
not appear to him a sufficient reason for relinquishing the con-
quests whisch he had already made, or against resuming his
operations with better hopes of success. The colony at Vera
Cruz was not only safe, but had remained unmolested. The
people of Zempoalla and the adjacent diftrias had discovered
no symptoms of defection. The Tlafcalans continued faithful
to their alliance. On their martial spirit, easily rouzed to
arms, and inflamed with implacable hatred of the Mexicans,
Cortes depended for powerful aid. He had frill the command of
a body of Spaniards, equal in number to that with which he
had opened his way into the centre of the empire, and had
taken poffeflion of the capital; so that with the benefit of
greater experience, as well as more perfect knowledge of the
country, he did not despair of quickly recovering all tltht he
had been deprived of by untoward events.

The mcafures FULL of this idea, he courted the Tlafcalan chiefs with such
he takes. attention, and diltributed among them so liberally the rich spoils

of

of Otumba, that he was secure of obtaining whatever he should Bn o oK

V.

require of the republic. He drew a small supply of ammuni- '-
tion, and two or three field-pieces, from his flores at Vera '5ZC
Cruz. He dispatched an officer of confidence with four flips
of Narvaez's fleet to Hispaniola and Jamaica, to engage adven-
turers, and to purchase horses, gunpowder, and other military
stores. As he knew that it would be vain to attempt the re-
dution of Mexico, unless he could secure the command of the
lake, he gave orders to prepare in the mountains of Tlafcala
materials for building twelve brigantines, so as they might be
carried thither in pieces ready to be put together, and launched-
when he flood in need of their service'.

BUT while, with provident attention, he was taking those Mutinouslr-

nt ofhis

necetfary steps towards the execution of his meafurcs, an ob- troops.
flacle arose in a quarter where it was leafl expected, but molt
formidable. The spirit of discontent and mutiny broke out in
his own army. Many of Narvaez's followers were planters
rather than soldiers, and had accompanied him to New Spain
with sanguine hopes of obtaining settlements, but with little in-
clination to engage in the hardships and dangers of war. As the
fame motives had induced them to enter into their new engage-
ments with Cortes, they no sooner became acquainted with the
nature of the service, than they bitterly repented of their choice.
Such of them as had the good fortune to survive the perilous
adventures in which their own imprudence had involved them,
happy in having made their escape, trembled at the thoughts
of being exposed a second time to similar calamities. As soon
as they discovered the intention of Cortes, they began fccretly

l C"' the imprudence of attacking a powerful empire with his ihattered

forces, and formally required him to lead them back directly
to Cuba. Though Cortes, long pradifed in the arts of com-
mand, employed arguments, entreaties, and presents, to con-
vince or to tooth them; though his own soldiers, animated with
the spirit of their leader, warmly seconded his endeavours; he
found their fears too violent and deep-rooted to be removed,
and the utmost he could effedt was to prevail with them to defer
their departure for some time, on a promise that he would, at
a more proper juncture, dismiss such as should desire it.

Means he THAT the malcontents might have no leisure to brood over
revive their the causes of their difaffecion, he resoLved. infrantly to call
confidence. forth his troops into action. He proposed to chastise the people

of Tepeaca for the outrage which they had committed, and, as
the detachment which they had cut off happened to be com-
posed mostly of soldiers who had served under Narvae,, their
companions, from the desire of vengeance, engaged more wil-
Augut. lingly in this war. He took the command in person, accom-

panied by a numerous body of Tlafcalans, and in the space of
a few weeks, after various encounters, with great slaughter of
the Tepeacans, reduced that province to fubjeCion. During
icveral months, while he waited for the fipplies of men and
ammunition which he expeCted, and; was carrying on, his pre-
parations for conftruding the brigantines, he kept hi,§ troops

ALL those preparatory arrangements, however, though the Strengthened

most prudent and efficacious which the situation of Cortes al- inforements.
lowed him to make, would have been of little avail, without a
reinforcement of Spanith soldiers. Of this he was so deeply
sensible, that it was the chief object of his thoughts and wishes ;
and yet his only profped of obtaining it from the return of the
officer whom he had sent to the isles to solicit aid, was both
distant and uncertain. But what neither his own sagacity nor
power could have procured, he owed to a series of fortunate
and unforeseen incidents. The governor of Cuba, to whom the
success of Narvaez appeared an event of infallible certainty,
having sent two small ships after him with new inflrutions
and a supply of men and military flores, the officer whom
Cortes had appointed to command on the coast, artfully decoy-
ed them into the harbour of Vera Cruz, seized the veflels, and
easily persuaded the soldiers to follow the standard of a more
able leader than him whom they were deflined to join f. Soon
after, three ships of more considerable force came into the har-
bour separately. These belonged to an armament fitted out by
Francilco de Garray, governor of Jamaica, who, being pofifefed
with the rage of discovery and conquest which animated every
Spaniard fettled in America, had long aimed at intruding into

-15 so They unadvisedly made their attempt on the northern pro-

vinces, where the country was poor and the people fierce and
warlike; and, after a cruel succession of disasters, famine com-
pelled them to venture into Vera Cruz, and cart themselves
O'ober zS. upon the mercy of their countrymen. Their fidelity was not

proof against the splendid hopes and promises which had fe-
duced other adventurers, and as if the spirit of revolt had been
contagious in New Spain, they likewise abandoned the matier
whom they were bound to serve, and inlifted under Cortes .
Nor was it America alone that furnished such unexpected aid.
A ship arrived from Spain, freighted by some private merchants
with military stores, in hopes of a profitable market in a coun-
try, the fame of whose opulence began to spread over Europe.
Cortes eagerly purchased a cargo which to him was invaluable,
and the crew, following the general example, joined him at
Tlafcala h.

mented with an hundred and eighty men, and twenty horses,
a reinforcement too inconsiderable to produce any consequence
which would entitle it to have been mentioned in the history
of other parts of the globe. But in that of America, where
great revolutions were brought about by causes which seemed
to bear no proportion to their effets, such small events rife
into importance, because they were fifficient to decide with
refpeCd to the fate of kingdoms. Nor is it the least remarkable

rival who wished to supplant him.

THE first effect of the junacion with his new followers was Numi crof

to enable him to difinifs such of Narvaez's soldiers as remained
with relucance in his service. After their departure, he still
mustered five hundred and fifty infantry, of which fourscore
were armed with muskets or cross-bows, forty horsemen, and
a train of nine field-pieces '. At the head of these, accompa-
nied by ten thousand Tlafcalans and other friendly Indians,
Cortes began his march towards Mexico, on the twenty-eighth

cient to gain their suffrages, although he had been less diftin-
guiflied for courage and capacity. He had an immediate
opportunity of shewing that he was worthy of their choice,
by conduaing, in person, those fierce attacks which compelled
the Spaniards to abandon his capital; and as soon as their retreat
afforded him any respite from action, he took measures for
preventing their return to Mexico, with prudence equal to the
spirit which he had displayed in driving them out of it. As

---.--' the motions and intentions of Cortes, he observed the storm that
1520. was gathering, and began early to provide against it. He re-

paired what the Spaniards had ruined in the city, and strength-
ened it with such new fortifications as the skill of his fubjeds
was capable of erecting. Beside filling his magazines with the
usual weapons of war, he gave direction to make long spears
headed with the swords and daggers taken from the Spaniards,
in order to annoy the cavalry. He summoned the people in
every province of the empire to take arms against their oppref-
fors, and as an encouragement to exert themselves with vigour,
he promised them exemption from all the taxes which his prede-
ceffors had imposed '. But what he laboured with the greatest
earnestness was, to deprive the Spaniards of the advantages which
they derived from the friendthip of the Tlafcalans, by endea-
vouring to pertuiade that people to renounce all connection with
men who were not only avowed enemies of the gods whom they
worshipped, but who would not fail to subjet them at last to
the fame yoke, which they were ndw inconsiderately lending
their aid to impose upon others. These representations, no less
striking than well-founded, were urged so forcibly by his am-
bafladors, that it required all the address of Cortes to prevent
their making a dangerous impression .

In his flead the Mexicans raised to the throne Guatimozin,

strength, murt have exposed his troops to inevitable deflruCtion.
Three months elapsed before the materials for conftruaing the
brigantines were finished, and before he heard any thing with
refpea to the success of the officer whom he had sent to His-
paniola. This, however, was not a season of inaaion to
Cortes. He attacked successively several of the towns situated
around the lake; and though all the Mexican power was ex-
erted to obftru: his operations, he either compelled them to
submit to the Spanifl crown, or reduced them to ruins. Other
towns he endeavoured to conciliate by more gentle means, and
though he could not hold any intercourse with the inhabitants
but by the intervention of interpreters, yet, under all the dif-
advantage of that tedious and imperfect mode of communica-
tion, he had acquired such thorough knowledge of the Rate of
the country, as well as of the dispositions of the people, that
he conducted his negociations and intrigues with astonishing
dexterity and success. Most of the cities adjacent to Mexico were
originally the capitals of small independent flates; and some of
them having been but lately annexed to the Mexican empire,
fill retained the remembrance of their ancient liberty, and bore
with impatience the rigorous yoke of their new maflers.
Cortes having early oblervcd symptoms of their (lifaffcdtion,
availed himni:lf of this knowledge to gain their conficence and
fiiendfhip. By offering, with confidence, to deliver them from
the odious dominion of the Mexicans, and by liberal proinifcs
of more indulgent treatmncnt, if they would unite with him
against their oppressors, he prevailed on the people of several
confiderablc difrics not only to acknowledge the king of Caflile

as their sovereign, but to supply the Spanish camp with pro- B O °V K
visions, and to strengthen his army with auxiliary troops. '----'
Guatimozin, on the first appearance of defeCtion among his i
fubjets, exerted himself with vigour to prevent or to punish
their revolt; but in ipite of his efforts, the spirit continued to
spread. The Spaniards gradually acquired new allies, and with
deep concern he beheld Cortes arming against his empire those
very hands which ought to have been aCive in its defence;
and ready to advance against the capital at the head of a nume-
rous body of his own subjes q.

WHILE, by those various methods, Cortes was gradually

circumscribing the Mexican power within such narrow limits
that his prospect of overturning it seemed neither to be uncer-
tain nor remote, all his schemes were well nigh defeated, by a
conspiracy no less unexpected than dangerous. The soldiers of
Narvaez had never united perfectly with the original compa-
nions of Cortes, nor did they enter into his measures with the
fame cordial zeal. Upon every occasion that required any ex-
traordinary effort of courage or of patience, their spirits were
apt to fink; and now, on a near view of what they had to en-
counter, in attempting to reduce a city so inaccessible as Mexico,
and defended by a numerous army, the resolution even of
those among them who had adhered to Cortes when he was
deserted by their associates, began to fail. Their fears led
them to prcfumptuous and unfoldier-like difcuflions concerning
the propriety of their general's measures, and the improbability
of their success. From these they proceeded to censure and
invectives, and at last began to deliberate how they might pro-

'--/ mander to be totally negligent. Antonio Villefagna, a private

soldier, but bold, intriguing, and firongly attached to Velasquez,
artfully fomented this growing spirit of difaffecion. His quar-
ters became the rendezvous of the malcontents, where, after
many consultations, they could discover no method of checking
Cortes in his career, but by assassinating him and his most con-
fiderable officers, and conferring the command upon some per-
son who would relinquish his wild plans, and adopt measures
more consistent with the general security. Despair inspired them
with courage. The hour for perpetrating the crime, the per-
sons whom they destined as viEtims, the officers to succeed
them in command, were all named; and the conspirators signed
an association, by which they bound themselves with most so-
lemn oaths to mutual fidelity. But on the evening before the
appointed day, one of Cortes's ancient followers, who had
been seduced into the conspiracy, touched with compunction
at the imminent danger of a man whom he had long been
accutfomed to revere, or firuck with horror at his own
treachery, went privately to his general, and revealed to him
all that he knew. Cortes, though deeply alarmed, discerned at
once what condu& was proper in a situation so critical. He
repaired inflantly to Villefagna's quarters, accompanied by
ftme of his molt trufly officers. The aflonifhment and con-
fusion of the man at this unexpeQed visit anticipated the con-
session of his guilt. Cortes, while his attendants feiznd the
traitor, snatched from his bosom a paper containing the aflocia-
tion, signed by the conspirators. Impatient to know how far the
defection extended, he retired to read it, and found there names
which fillcd hiin with fiirprilf. and for);'o\v. But, aware how
dangerous a flri- fIcrutiny might prove at such a juncture, lie

confined his judicial inquiries to Villefagna alone. As the B 0 0 I

proofs of his guilt were manifest, he was condemned after a 1----
short trial, and next morning he was seen hanging before the 1521.
door of the house in which he had lodged. Cortes called his
troops together, and having explained to them the atrocious
purpose of the conspirators, as well as the justice of the punish-
ment inflicted on Villefagna, he added, with an appearance of
satisfaCtion, that he was entirely ignorant with refpet to all
the circumfiances of this dark tranfadion, as the traitor, when
arrested, had suddenly torn and swallowed a paper, which pro-
bably contained an account of it, and under the severest tor-
tures possessed such conflancy as to conceal the names of his
accomplices. This artful declaration restored tranquillity to
many a breast that was throbbing, while he spoke, with con-
fcioufnefs of guilt and dread of detection; and by this prudent
moderation, Cortes had the advantage of having difcovcred
and of being able to observe such of his followers as were dif-
affeded; while they, flattering themselves that their pass crime
was unknown, endeavoured to avert any suspicion of it, by re-
doubling their aftivity and zeal in his service '.

xIsZ" vigilance, aaivity, and courage which he manifested on every

occasion, was growing daily in his confidence, and in the efti-
mation of his fellow-foldiers. The service was no less singular
than important; the beams, the planks, the maRss, the cordage,
the fails, the iron-work, and all the infinite variety of articles
requisite for the confirution of thirteen brigantines, were to
be carried: sixty miles over land through a mountainous coun-
try, by people who were unacquainted with the ministry of
domeflic animals, or the: aid of machines to facilitate any work
of labour. The Tlafcalans furnished eight thousand Tamenes,
an inferior order of men destined for servile talks, to carx-y the
materials on their shoulders, and appointed fifteen thousand
warriors to accompany and defend them. Sandoval made the
disposition for their progress with great propriety, placing the
Tamenes in the centre, one body of warriors in the front,
another in the rear, with considerable parties to cover the flanks.
To each of there he joined some Spaniards, not only to assist
them in danger, but to accustom them to regularity and sub-
ordination. A body so numerous, and so much encumbered,
advanced leisurely, but in excellent order; and in some places,
where it was confined by the woods or mountains, the line of
march extended above fix miles. Parties of Mexicans frequently
appeared hovering around them on the high grounds; but per-
ceiving no profpea of success in attacking an enemy coininually
on his guard, and prepared to receive them, they did not ven-
ture to molest him X and Sandoval had the glory of conducing
safely to Tezcuco a convoy on which all the future operations
of his countrymen depended '.

ihips arrived at Vera Cruz from Hilpaniola, with two hundred '- --
soldiers, eighty horses, two battering cannon, and a confi- RccaC,.e a
derable supply of ammunition and arms'. Elevated with ob- forcreent
serving that all his preparatory Ichemes, either for recruiting
his own army, or impairing the force of :he enemy, had now
produced their full effec, Cortes, impatient to begin the siege
in form, hastened the launching of the brigantines. To faci-
litate this, he had employed a vast number of Indians for two
months in deepening the small rivulet which runs by Tezeuco
into the lake, and in forming it into a canal near two miles in
length "; and though the Mexicans, aware of his intentions, as
well as of the danger which threatened them, endeavoured fre-
quently to interrupt the labourers, or to burn the brigantines,
the work was at last completed". On the twenty-eighth of April, The brigan-

tines launch-

all the Spanish troops, together with the auxiliary Indians, were ed.
drawn up on the banks of the canal; and with extraordinary mi-
litary pomp, heightened and rendered more solemn by the cele-
bration of the most sacred rites of religion, the brigantines were
launched. As they fell down the canal in order, Father Olmedo
blessed them, and gave each its name. Every eye followed them
with wonder and hope, until they entered the lake, when they
hoisted their fails, and bore away before the wind. A general
shout of joy was raised; all admiring that bold inventivegenius,
which, by means so extraordinary that their success almofi ex-
ceeded belief, had acquired the command of a fleet, without

Dispositions CORTES determined to attack the city from three different
fortheficge. quarters; from Tezeuco on the east fide of the lake, from Ta-

cuba on the weft, and from Cuyocan towards the south. Those
towns were situated on the principal causeways which led to the
capital, and intended for their defence. He appointed Sandoval
to command in the first, Pedro de Alvarado in the second, and
Chriftoval de Olid in the third; allotting to each a numerous
body of Indian auxiliaries, together with an equal division of
Spaniards, who, by the junction of the troops from Hispaniola,
amounted now to eighty-fix horsemen, and eight hundred and
eighteen foot soldiers; of whom a hundred and eighteen were
armed with muskets or cross-bows. The train of artillery con-
lifted of three battering-cannon, and fifteen field-pieces Z. He
reserved for himself, as the station of greatest importance and:
danger, the condut of the brigantines, each armed with one of
his small cannon, and manned with twenty-five Spaniards.

them, they broke down the aqueducts which the ingenuity of

ser '. Alvarado and Olid found the towns of which they were

and dreaded. Though the brigantines, after all the labour
and merit of Cortes in forming them, were of inconfider-
able bulk, rudely conftruded, and manned chiefly with land-
men, hardly possessed of skill enough to conduc them, they
muff have been objects of terror to a people unacquainted
with any navigation but that of their lake, and possessed of no
vessel larger than a canoe. Necessity, however, urged Guati-
mozin to hazard the attack; and hoping to supply by numbers
what he wanted in force, he assembled such a multitude of
canoes as covered the face of the lake. They rowed on boldly to
the charge, while the brigantines, retarded by a dead calm, could
scarcely advance to meet them. But as the enemy drew near, Repulsed.
a breeze suddenly sprung up; in a moment the fails were
spread, and the brigantines, with irresistible impetuosity, broke
through their feeble opponents, overset many canoes, and dif-
fipated the whole armament with such slaughter, as convinced
the Mexicans, that the progress of the Europeans in knowledge
and arts rendered their superiority greater on this new clement
than they had hitherto found it by land b.

V. '----' tance from each other, but were employed to cover the cause-

2' ways on each fide, and keep off the canoes, when they at-

tempted to annoy the troops as they advanced towards the city.
He formed the brigantines in three divisions, allotting one to
each Rtation, with orders to second the operations of the officer
who commanded there. From all the three itations he pushed
on the attack againfP the city with equal vigour; but in a
manner so very different from the condut of sieges in regular
war, that he himself seems afraid it would appear no less
improper than singular, to persons unacquainted with his
situation . Each morning his troops assaulted the barricades
which the enemy had ereced on the causeways, forced their
way over the trenches which they had dug, and through the
canals where the bridges were broken down, and endeavoured
to penetrate into the heart of the city, in hopes of obtain-
ing some decisive advantage, which might force the enemy
to surrender, and terminate the war at once; but when the
obstinate valour of the Mexicans rendered the efforts of the day
ineffecual, the Spaniards retired in the evening to their former
quarters. Thus their toil and danger were, in some measure,
continually renewed ; the Mexicans repairing in the night what
the Spaniards had defiroyed through the day, and recovering
the polls from which they had driven them. But necessity
prescribed this flow and untoward mode of operation. The
number of his troops vas t finall, that Cortes durst not; with
a llallful of men, attempt to make a lo ncgmcnt in a city where
he might be surrounded and annoyed by 'Lich a multitude of
enemies. The rcemembrance of wlat he hadl already suffered
by the ill-judged confidence with which he had ventured into

such a dangerous situation, was flill fresh in his mind. The B 0 0 K

V.

Spaniards, exhausted with fatigue, were unable to guard the »-
various posts which they daily gained ; and though their camp
was filled with Indian auxiliaries, they durst not devolve this
charge upon them, because they were so little accustomed to
discipline, that no confidence could be placed in their vigilance.
Besides this, Cortes was extremely solicitous to preserve the city
as much as possible from being destroyed, both because he defined
it to be the capital of his conquests, and wiflcd that it might
remain as a monument of his glory. From all there confider-
ations, he adhered obstinately, for a month after the siege was
opened, to the system which he had adopted. The Mexicans, in
their own defence, displayed valour which was hardly inferior
to that with which the Spaniards attacked them. On land, on
water, by night and by day, one furious conflict succeeded to
another. Several Spaniards were killed, more wounded, and
all were ready to fink under the toils of unintermitting service,
which were rendered more intolerable by the injuries of the
season, the periodical rains being now set in with their usual
violence '.

ASTONISHED and disconcerted with the length and difficul- JEndeavours

ties of the siege, Cortcs determined to make one great effort to tby i therm
get poffeflion of the city before he rclinquifhed the plan which
he had hitherto followed, and had recourse to any other mode
of attack. With this view, he sent inflrudions to Alvarado
and Sandoval to advance with their divisions to a general aflault,
and took the command in person of that potted on the caufcway
of Cuyocan. Animated by his prceence, and the expelqation July ;.

V.
---- other, forced their way over the ditches and canals, and having
ji' 'entered the city, gained ground incessantly, in spite of the mul-

titude and ferocity of their opponents. Cortes, though de-
lighted with the rapidity of his progress, did not forget that he
might still find it necessary to retreat; and in order to secure it,
appointed Julian de Alderete, a captain of chief note in the
troops which he had received from Hispaniola, to fill up the
canals and gaps in the causeway as the main body advanced.
That officer, deeming it inglorious to be thus employed, while
his companions were in the heat of action and the career of
victory, negleted the important charge committed to him, and
hurried on inconsiderately to mingle with the combatants. The
Mexicans, yhofe military attention and Ikill were daily im-
proving, no sooner observed this, than they carried an account
of it to their monarch.
Repulsed GUATIMOZIN inflantly discerned the consequences of the

error which the Spaniards had committed, and, with admir-
able pretence of mind, prepared to take advantage of it.
He commanded the troops polled in the front to flacken their
efforts, in order to allure the Spaniards to push forward, while
he dispatched a large body of chosen warriors through different
fireets, some by land, and others by water, towards the great
breach in the causeway, which had been left open. On a fig-
nal which he gave, the priests in the principal templectruck
the great drum consecrated to the god of war. No sooner did
the Mexicans hear its doleful solemn found, calculated to in-
spire them with contempt of death and enthusiastic ardour, than
they rushed upon the enemy with frantic rage. The Spaniards,
unable to resist men urged on no less by religious fury than

good countenance; but as the enemy pressed on, and their own -
impatience to escape increased, the terror and confusion became ''-
so general, that when they arrived at the gap in the causeway,
Spaniards and Tlafcalans, horsemen and infantry, plunged in
promiscuously, while the Mexicans ruffed upon them fiercely
from every fide, their light canoes carrying them through shoals
which the brigantines could not approach. In vain did Cortes
attempt to stop and rally his flying troops ; fear rendered them
regardless of his entreaties or commands. Finding all his en-
deavours to renew the combat fruitless, his next care was to
save some of those who had thrown themselves into the water;
but while thus employed, with more attention to their situation
than to his own, fix Mexican captains suddenly laid hold of withconfi-

added to what they really saw or heard, and augmented its

could not, like them, relieve his mind by giving vent to its

order to revive the spirit and hopes of his followers. The junc-
ture, indeed, required an extraordinary exertion of fortitude.
The Mexicans, elated with their victory, sallied out next morn-
ing to attack him in his quarters. But they did not rely
on the efforts of their own arms alone. They Tent the heads
of the Spaniards whom they had sacrificed to the leading men

war, appcafcd by the blood of their invaders, which had been
shed so plentifully on his altars, had declared with aniudclible

which had hitherto remained inactive, took arms with enthufi- lidianil;c-.

auxiliaries who had joined Cortcs, accuflomed to venerate tlh
fame deities with the Mexicans, and to receive the refponfcs of
their priefis with the fame implicit fIaith, abandoned the Spa-
niards as a race of men devoted to certain deftrulion. Even
the fidelity of the Tlafcalans was fhlaken, and tlhe Spanifl
troops were left almost alone in their stations. Cortes finding
that he attempted in vain to dispel the fuperiitious fears of his
confederates by argument, took advantage, from the impru-
dence of those who had framed the prophecy, in fixing its ac-
complifhment so near at hand, to give a striking demonfiration

Even with such a numerous army, he found it necessary to
adopt a new and more wary system of operation. Instead of
renewing his attempts to become master of the city at once, by
such bold but dangerous efforts of valour as he had already
tried, he made his advances gradually, and with every possible
precaution against exposing his men to any calamity similar to
that which they fill bewailed. As the Spaniards pushed for-
ward, the Indians regularly repaired the causeways behind
them. As soon as they got poffelfion of any part of the town,
the houses were instantly levelled with the ground. Day by
day, the Mexicans, forced to retire as their enemies gained
ground, were hemmed in within more narrow limits. Guati-
mozin, though unable to flop the career of the enemy, conti-
nued to defend his capital with obstinate resolution, and dif-
puted every inch of ground. But the Spaniards, having not
only varied their mode of attack, but, by orders of Cortes,
having changed the weapons with which they fought, were
again armed with the long Chinantlan spears, which they had
employed with such success against Narvaez, and, by the firm
array in which this enabled them to range themselves, they
repelled, with little danger, the loose assault of the Mexicans:
incredible numbers of them fell in the conflits which they
renewed every day '. While war wafted without, famine be-
gan to consume them within the city. The Spanilh brigan-
tincs, having the entire command of the lake, rendered it im-
possible to receive any supply of provisions by water. ~The vast
number of his Indian auxiliaries enabled Cortes to fliut up the
avenues to the city by land. The stores which Guatimozin had
laid up were exhausted, by the multitudes which crouded into

nued their progress. At length all the three divisions pene-
trated into the great square in the centre of the city, and made
a secure lodgment there. Three-fourths of the city were now
reduced, and laid in ruins. The remaining quarter was fb
closely pressed, that it could not long withfand assailants who
attacked it from their new flation with superior advantage, and
more assured expectation of success. The Mexican nobles,
solicitous to save the life of a monarch whom they revered, pre-
vailed on Guatimozin to retire from a place where resistance was
now vain, that he might rouse the more distant provinces of the
empire to arms, and maintain there a more successful firuggle
with the public enemy. In order to facilitate the execution of
this mcafure, they endcavoured to amure Cortcs with overtures
of fubmiflion, that, while his attention was employed in adjust-
ing the articles of pacification, Guatimozini might cfcape unpcr-
ceivcd. But they made this attempt upon a leader of gcater
sagacity and ditcernment than to be deceived by their arts.

only that no insult might be offered to the empress or his chil-
dren. Vhen conduced to Cortes, he appeared neither with
the fullen fierceness of a barbarian, nor with the dejecLion of a
supplicant. " I have done," said he, addressing himself to the

which both knew that the fortune of the empire depended. As .
the struggle here was more obflinate, it was likewise more equal

The great abilities of Guatimozin, the number of his troops,
the peculiar situation of his capital, so far counterbalanced the

Guatimozin, aware of his impending fate, had ordered what
remained of the riches amassed by his anceflors to be thrown
into the lake. The Indian auxiliaries, while the Spaniards
*were engaged in conflict with the enemy, had carried off the
most valuable part of the spoil. The fum to be divided among
the conquerors was so small, that many of them disdained to
accept of the pittance which fell to their share, and all mur-
mured and exclaimed; some, against Cortes and his confidents,
whom they fufpeted of having secretly appropriated to their
own use, a large portion of the riches which should have been
brought into the common flock; others, againfl Guatimozin,
whom they accused of obflinacy, in refusing to discover the

Without regarding the former dignity of Guatimozin, or feel-
ing any reverence for those virtues which he had displayed, he
fubjetced the unhappy monarch, togcther with his chief favou-

tes, ashamed of a scene so horrid, rescued the royal victim from
the hands of his torturers, and prolonged a life reserved for
new indignities and sufferings.".

THE fate of the capital, as both parties had foreseen, decided All the prn-

that of the empire. The provinces submitted one after another ei,'pire su'b
to the conquerors. Small detachments of Spaniards marching mnit
through them without interruption, penetrated in different
quarters to the great Southern Ocean, which, according to the
ideas of Columbus, they imagined would open a short as well
as easy passage to the East Indies, and secure to the crown of
Castile all the envied wealth of those fertile regions "; and the Cortes forms

_ .--._ tleman of honourable birth, having served several years in the
15Z1. East Indies, with distinguished valour, under the famous Albu-

querque, demanded the recompence which he thought due to
his services, with the boldness natural to a high spirited soldier.
But, for some reason which is not explained, both his general
and his sovereign rejected his suit with a disdainful coldness,
that was intolerable to a man conscious of what he had done,
and of what he deserved. In a transport of resentment, he
formally renounced his allegiance to an ungrateful mafler, and
r ,7. fled to the court of Castile, in hopes that there his worth would

be more justly estimated. He endeavoured to recommend him-
self by proposing to execute a scheme, the accomplishment of
which,-he knew, would wound the monarch againfl whom he
was exasperated in the most tender part. He revived Colurn-
bus's original and favourite projed, ofdifcovering a paifage to
India by a westerly course, and without encroaching on that
portion of the globe which was allotted to the Portuguese by
the line of demarcation. I-Ie founded his hopes of success on
the ideas of that great navigator, confirmed by many obferva-
tions, the result of his own naval experience, as well as that of
his countrymen, in their intercourse with the Eafr. The un-
dertaking, he acknowledged, was botih arduous and expensive,
as it couldl not be attempted but with a fquadrlon of confidcrable
force, and victualled for at Icaft two ycars. l'ortunately, he
applied to a nlinifer whlo wsas not apt to be dctcri-ced,c ither by

according to the ideas of the age, were deemed to be of
considerable force, though tlie burden of the largefl did not
exceed one hundred and twenty tons. The crews of the whole
amounted to two hundred and thirty-four men, among whom
were some of the most skilful pilots in Spain, and fevcral lPor-
tuguefe sailors, in whose experience, as more extensive, Ma-
gellan placed still greater confidence. After touching at the
Canaries, he flood direCtly south towards the equinoctial line
along the coast of America, but was so long retarded by tedious
calms, and spent so much time in searching every bay and inlet
for that communication with the Southern Ocean which he
wished to discover, that he did not reach the river De la Plata till
the twelfth of January. That spacious opening through which i, o.

desperate adventurer, and returning directly to Spain. This
dangerous infurredion Magellan suppressed, by an effort of
courage no lets prompt than intrepid, and inflicted exemplary
punishment on the ringleaders. With the remainder of his
followers, overawed but not reconciled to his scheme, he con-
tinued his voyage towards the south, and at length discovered,
near the fifty-third degree of latitude, the mouth of a firait,
into which he entered, notwithstanding the murmurs and re-
monstrances of the people under his command. After failing
twenty days in that winding dangerous channel, to which he
gave his own name, and where one of his ships deserted him,
the great Southern Ocean opened to his view, and with tears of
joy he returned thanks to Heaven for having thus far crowned
his endeavours with iuccefs .

BUT he was still at a greater distance than he imagined from

the object of his wifles. He failed during three months and
twenty days in an uniform direction towards the north-west,
without discovering land. In this voyage, the longest that had
ever been made in the unbounded ocean, he fufTered incredible
diflrefs. His flock of provisions was almoll exhausted, the
water became putrid, the men were reduced to the fiortefl al-
lowance with which it was pollible to fuflain lifc, and the
scurvy, the most dreadful of all the maladies with which sea-
faring people are afllidited, began to fprcad among the crew.

tremity that they mull have funk under their sufferings, they
fell in with a clutter of finall but fertile islands, which afforded March 6,
them refreshments in such abundance, that their health w-as
soon re-eflablifhed. From these isles, which he called De los
Ladclones, he proceeded on his voyage, and soon made a more
important discovery of the islands now known by the name of
the Philippines. In one of there he got into an unfortunate
quarrel with the natives, who attacked him with a numerous
body of troops well armed ; and while lie fo-ught at the licad
of his men with his usual valour, he fell by the hands of those April 26
barbarians, together with several of his principal officers.

THE expedition was prosecutcd under other commanders.

After visiting many of the smaller isles scattered in tle callern
part of the Indian ocean, they touched at the great island of
Borneo, and at length landed in Tidore, one of the Moluccas, Nov. 8.
to the astonishment of the Portuguese, wlo could not compre-
hend how the Spaniards, by holding a weflt-ly cou rs, lhad arrived
at that fequefrered feat of their most valuable conllmmece, whicl
they themselves had discovered by failing in an opposite direc-
tion. There, and in the adjacent isles, the Spaniards found a
people acquainted with the benefits of'extenlfive trade, and willing
to open an intercourse with a new nation. T'hey took in a cargo
of the precious fpiccs, ,which are the diflingiilicd lprodudlion
of those islands, and with tliat, as Swell as with liiccilmens or

space of three years and twenty-eight days q

THOUGH an untimely fate deprived Magellan of the satis-

fadtion of accomplishing this great undertaking, his contem-
poraries, just to his memory and talents, ascribed to him not
only the honour of having formed the plan, but of having fur-
mounted almost every obstacle to the completion of it; and in
the present age his name is still ranked among the highest in the
roll of eminent and successful navigators. The naval glory of
Spain now eclipsed that of every other nation, and by a lingular
felicity ihe had the merit, in the course of a few years, of dii-
covering a new continent almost as large as that part of the
earth which was formerly known, and of ascertaining by ex-
perience the form and extent of the whole terraqueous globe.

THE Spaniards were not satisficd with the glory of having

first encompaflscd the earth; they expected to derive great coim-
mercial advantages from this new and boldeit effort of their
maritime skill. The men of science among theim contended,
that the spice ifands, and several of the richelt countries in the
Eapt, were so situated as to belong of right to thg, crown of
Caltile, in consequence of the partition made by Alexander VI.
The merchants, without attending to this difcuflion, engaged

sion of such formidable rivals, remonflrated and negociated in -----
Europe, while in Asia they obftrued llthe trade of the Spaniards
by force of arms. Charles, not fuficieintly inflruced with rc-
f£pet to the importance of this valuable branch of commerce,
or diftraCed by the multiplicity of his fcliemcs and operations,
did not afford his subjects proper protction. At last, the low
slate of his finances, exhaufled by the cfforts of his arms in
every part of Europe, together with the dread of adding a new
war with Portugal to those in which lie was already engaged,
induced him to make over his claim of the Moluccas to the Por-
tuguefe for three hundred and fifty thousand ducats. HIe reserved,
however, to the crown, of Castile the right of reviving its pre-
tenfiors on repayment of that. fum, but other obje&s engrocfed
his attention and that of his fuccellbrs; and Spain was finally
excluded from a branch of commerce in which it was engaging
with sanguine expctations of profit '.

THOUGH the trade with the Moluccas was relinquished,

the voyage of Magellan was followed by commercial effccts of
great moment in Spain. Philip II. in the year one thousand
five hundred and fixty-four, reduced tllol illands whic he
dilfovercd in the Eafrern Ocean to ;fubjedion, and cflablilicld
fettlemcnts there ; between -which and the kingdom of New

I---.- ' comnmifion or authority from the sovereign whom he was

-) i' fcrving with such successful zeal, but to be regarded as an un-

.dutiful and seditious subjed. By the influence of Fonseca,
bhifhop of Burgos, his conduct in afluming the government of
'New Spain was declared to be an irregular usurpation, in con-
,tempt of the royal authority; and Clirifloval de Tapia received
.a commiflion, impowering him to supersede Cortes, to seize his
person, to confiscate his effets, to make a firid scrutiny into
his proceedings, and to transmit the result of all the inquiries
carried on in New Spain to the council of the Indies, of which
the bishop of Burgos was president. A few weeks after the
reduction of Mexico, Tapia landed at Vcra Cruz with the royal
mandate to flrip its conqueror of his power, and to treat him
as a criminal. But Fonseca had chosen a very improper inflru-
ment to wreak his vengeance on Cortes. Tapia had neither
the reputation nor the talents that suited the high command to
.uwhich he which he was appointed. Cortes, while he publickly expressed

the most refpedful veneration for the emperor's authority, fe-
cretly took meaflires to defeat the effed of his commission; and
having involved Tapia and his followers in a multiplicity of
negociations and conferences, in which he sometimes had rc-
cour fe to threats, but more frequently employed bribes and
promircs, he at length prevailed on that weak man to abandon
a province which he was unworthy of governing '.

His rchemnes EVEN before his jurifdiEtion received this legal fandion,
and arrange-
menri. Cortes ventured to exercise all the powers of a governor, and,

by various arrangements, endeavoured to render his conquest a
secure and beneficial acquisition to his country. He determin-
ed to efablifhi the feat of government in its ancient flation,
and to raise Mexico again from its ruins; and having conceived
high ideas concerning the future grandeur of the fiate of which
he was laying the foundation, he began to rebuild its capital
on a plan which hath gradually formed the molt magnificent
city in the New World. At the fame time, he employed fkil-
ful persons to search for mines in different parts of the coun-
try, and opened some which were found to be richer than any
which the Spaniards had hithierto dilcovcred in America. He
detached his principal officers into the remote provinces, and
encouraged them to fettle there, not only by beflowing upon
them large tracts of land, but by granting tlem the fame do-
minion over the Indians, and the fame right to their fcrvice,
which the Spaniards had atlumicd in the islands.

the glory redounding from these repeated vicories by their --
mode of treating the vanquished people. After taking Guati- s~z.
mozin, and becoming malters of his capital, they supposed that
the king of Castile entered on possession of all the rights of the
captive monarch, and affected to confider every effort of the
Mexicans to aflert their own independence, as the rebellion of
vaflals against their sovereign, or the mutiny of slaves against
their matter. Under the fandion of those ill-founded maxims,
they violated every right that should be held sacred between
hostile nations. After each infurredion, they reduced the com-
mon people in the provinces which they subdued, to the most hu-
miliating of all conditions, that of personal servitude. Their
chiefs, supposed to be more criminal, were punished with greater
severity, and put to death in the most ignominious or the most
excruciating mode, that the insolence or the cruelty of their con-
querors could devise. In almost every diftrid of the Mexican
empire, the progress of the Spanish arms is marked with blood,
and with deeds so atrocious as disgrace the enterpriling valour
that conduaced them to success. In the country of Panuco,
sixty caziques, or leaders, and four hundred nobles, were burnt
at one time. Nor was this ihocking barbarity perpetrated in
any sudden rally of rage, or by a commander of inferior note.
It was the ac of Sandoval, an offlicer whose name is entitled to
the fccond rank in the annals of New Spain, executed after a
folcinii consultation with Cortes ; and to complete the horror of
the fccne, the children and relations of the wretched vic.iirs
were affcmbled, and compelled to he frpctators of their dying
agonies Y. It fecms Irardly poflible to cxced in horror this
dreadful example of severity, but it was followed by another,

B op K which affeded the Mexicans frill more sensibly, as it gave
--_ --' them a most feeling proof of their own degradation, and of the

1522. finall regard that their haughty masters retained for the ancient

dignity and splendour of their slate. On a flight suspicion, con-
firmed by very imperfect evidence, that Guatimozin had form-
ed a scheme to fliake off the yoke, and to excite his former
fubjeds to take arms, Cortes, without the formality of a trial,.
ordered the unhappy monarch, together with the caziques of
Tezeuco and Tacuba, the two persons of greatest eminence in.
the empire, to be hanged; and the Mexicans, with astonish,-
men-t and horror, beheld this disgraceful punishment inflicted
upon persons, to whom they were accustomed to look up
with reverence, hardly inferior to that which they paid to the
gods themselves z. The example of Cortes and his principal
officers encouraged and justified persons of Subordinate rank to
venture upon committing greater excesses. Nuno de Guzman,
in particular, tained an illustrious name by deeds of peculiar
enormity and rigour, in various expeditions which he con-
duated .

Firflobje&t ONE circumstance, however, saved the Mexicans from far-
of indultry
among the ther consumption, perhaps from one as complete as that which
conquerors. had depopulated the islands. The first conquerors did. not at-

tempt to search for the precious metals in the bowels of the
earth. They were neither sufficiently wealthy to carry on the
expensive works, which are requisite for opening. those deep
recesses where Nature has concealed the veins of gold and
silver, nor sufficiently skilful to perform the ingenious opera-
tions by which they are separated from their refpeeqive ores.

They were satisfied with the more simple method, pradifed by B o

V K

the Indians, of wafling the earth carried down rivers and tor- -
rents from the mountains, and collecing the grains of native I''Z'
metal deposited there. The rich mines of New Spain, which
have poured forth their treasures with such profusion on every
quarterof the globe,were not difcoveredforfeveral years after the Is5z, &c.
conquef b. By that time, a more orderly government and police
were introduced into the colony; experience, derived from former
errors, had suggested many useful and humane regulations for
the protection and preservation of the Indians; and though it
then became neceflary to increase the number of those employed
in the mines, and they were engaged in a species of labour more
pernicious to the human constitution, they suffered less hard-
ihip or diminution than from the ill-judged, but less extensive,
schemes of the first conquerors.

THIS extraordinary mortality among the Indians, dif- Thoir po

appointed the hopes of their new mailers. Few seem to have vey
derived any considerable wealth from their ill-conduted
researches. According to the usual fate of firfl settlers in new
colonies, it was their lot to encounter danger and to struggle
with difficulties; the fruits of their victories and toils were re-
served for times of tranquillity, and reaped by successors of
greater industry, but of inferior merit. The early hiftoriana
of America abound with accounts of the sufferings and of the
poverty of its conquerors '. In New Spain, their condition
was rendered more grievous by a peculiar arrangement. When
Charles V. advanced Cortes to the government of that country,

much elevated with their promotion, that they thought they
were called to ad a part of the first consequence. But being
accustomed to the minute formalities of office, and having con-
traded the narrow ideas suited to the sphere in which they had

at the high authority which Cortes exercised, and could not
conceive that the mode of administration, in a country recently
subdued and fettled, must be different from that which took
place in one where tranquillity and regular government had
been long established. In their letters, they represented Cortes
as an ambitious tyrant, who having usurped a jurifdidion fupe-

wealth and extensive influence, might accomplifl those dif-
loyal schemes which he apparently meditated e. These infinu-

he advanced from the lake of Mexico to the western extremi-

arrival in New Spain, prevented the execution of this commit- _--
sion. But as the objec of his appointment was known, the Cortesre-
mind of Cortes was deeply wounded with this unexpeeted re- pa'n'
turn for services which far exceded whatever any subject of
Spain had rendered to his sovereign. I-Ie endeavoured, how-
ever, to maintain hi ilation, and to recover the confidence of
the court. But every perfun in office, who had arrived from
Spain since the conqucft, was a spy upon his conduct, and with
malicious ingenuity gave an unfavourable representation of all
his actions. The apprehensions of Charles and his ministers
incrcafed. A new commission of inquiry was issucd, with more r sza
extensive powers, and various precautions were taken in order
to prevent or to punish him, if he should be so prefuimptuous as
to attempt what was inconsistent with the fidelity of a subjec1t
Cortes beheld the approaching crisis of his fortune with all the
violent emotions natural to a haughty mind, conscious of high

of his desperate followers urged him to aflert his own rights
against his ungrateful country, and, with a bold hand, to fcize
that power which the courtiers meanly accused him of coveting ',
he retained such felf-command, or was actuated with such fen-
timcnts of loyalty, as to rejet their dangerous counsels, and to
chufe the only course in which he could secure his own dignity,
without departing from his duty. IHe resolvcd not to cxpofe
himself to the ignominy of a trial, in that country which had
been the scene of his triumphs; but, without waiting for the

there. that suited the conqueror of a mighty kingdom. He brought

with him a great part of his wealth, many jewels and orna-
ments of great value, several curious productions of the coun-
try', and was attended by some Mexicans of the first rank, as
well as by the most considerable of his own officers. His ar-
rival in Spain removed at once every suspicion and fear that had
been entertained with respect to his intentions. The emperor,
having now nothing to apprehend from the designs of Cortes,
received him like a person whom consciousness of his own
innocence had brought into the presence of his master, and who
was intitled, by the eminence of his services, to the highest
marks of dilfintion and refped. The order of St. Jago, the
title of Marquis del Valle de Guaxaca, the grant of a vail ter-
ritory in New Spain, were successively bellowed upon him;
and as his manners were correc and elegant, although he had
passed the greater part of his life among rough adventurers, the
emperor admitted him to the fame familiar intercourse with
himself, that was enjoyed by noblemen of the firit rank .

sagacious to commit such an important charge to a man whom
he had once fufpeaed, peremptorily refuted to invert him again
with powers which he might find it impossible to controul.

Cortes, though dignified with new titles, returned to Mexico
with diminished authority. The military department, with
powers to attempt new discoveries, was left in his hands; but
the supreme direction of civil affairs was placed in a board called
The Azudience of New Spain. At a subsequent period, when,
upon the increase of the colony, the exertion of authority more
united and extensive became necessary, Antonio de Mendoza,
a nobleman of high rank, was sent thither as Viceroy, to take
the government into his hands..

THIS division of power in New Spain proved, as was un-

avoidable, the source of perpetual dissention, which embittered
the life of Cortes, and thwarted all his schemes. As he had
now no opportunity to display his active talents but in attempt-
ing new discoveries, he formed various schemes for that purpose,
all of which bear impressions of a genius that delighted in what
was bold and splendid. He early entertained an idea, that,
either by fleering through the gulf of Florida along the eafl
coast of North America, some strait would be found that com-
municated with the weflern ocean; or that, by examining the
isthmus of Darien, some passage would be discovered between
the North and South Seas". But having been disappointed in his
expectations with respeCt to both, he now confined his views to
such voyages of diicovery as he could make from the ports of
New Spain in the South Sea. There he fitted out successively
several small squadrons, which either periflhed in the attempt,
or returned without making any discovery of moment. Cortes,
weary of entrusting the conduct of his operations to others,
took the command of a new armament in person, and, after

abruptly abandoned his charge, enlisted as a soldier, and after
serving some years in Italy, embarked for America, which, by 15'4'
opening such a boundless range to aCtive talents, allured every
adventurer whose fortune was not equal to his ambitious
thoughts. Tlere, Pizarro early difiinguifhed himfclf. With
a temper of mind no less daring than the constitution of his
body was robust, he was foremost in every danger, patient
under the greatest hardships, and unfubducd by any fatigue.
Though so illiterate that he could not even read, he was soon
confidered as a man formed to command. Every operation
committed to his conduCt proved successful, as, by a happy but
rare conjunCtion, he united perseverance with ardour, and was
as cautious in executing, as he was bold in forming his plans.
By engaging early in aCtive life, without any resource but his
own talents and industry, and by depending on himself alone
in his struggles to emerge from obscurity, he acquired such a
thorough knowledge of affairs, and of men, that he was fitted
to assume a superior part in conducting the one, and in govern-
ing the other '

ALMAGRO had as little to boafn of his dcfcent as Pizarro. The

one was a bastard, the other a foundling. Bred, like his com-
panion, in the camp, he yielded not to him in any of the fol-
dierly qualities of intrepid valour, indelftigable activity, or
inftirmounta)lc conifa;ncy in enduring the harldflips infcparable
from military ferricc in the New World. But in Almagro

B 0 0 IC and candour natural to men whose profession is arms; in Pi-

.-- ----' zarro, they were united with the address, the craft, and the

dissimulation of a politician, with the art of concealing his own
purposes, and with sagacity to penetrate into those of other
men.

I-IERNANDO DE LUQUE was an ecclesiastic, who aCted both

as priest and schoolmaster at Panama, and, by means which
the contemporary writers have not described, had amassed riches
that inlipired him with thoughts of riling to greater emi-

nen ce.

Term' of SUCH were the men deflined to overturn one of the most ex-
their afilbcia-
tion, tensive empires on the face of the earth. Their confederacy for

this purpose was authorised by Pedrarias, the governor of Pa-
nama. Each engaged to employ his whole fortune in the ad-
venture. Pizarro, the least wealthy of the three, as he could
not throw so large a fum as his afrociates into the common flock,
engaged to take the department of greatest fatigue and danger,
and to command in person the armament which was to go first
upon discovery. Alinagro offered to condut the supplies of
proviiions and rcinforcements of troops, of which Pizarro might
fiand in need. Luque was to remain at Panama to negociate
with the governor, and luperintend whatever was carrying on
for the general interest. As the spirit of cn,thufiafin uniformly
accompanied that of adventure in the New World,- and by tlat
strange union both acquired an incrcafe of force, this confede-
racy, formed by ambition and avarice, was confirmed by the
Inol solemn aLl of religion. Luque celebrated mass, divided a
confccratcd hofl in to thiree, and refrving one parlt to himlfclt,
gave the other two to his afibciatcs, of which tlhe partook ; and

thllus,

thus, in name of the Prince of Peace, ratified a contract of B O 0 K
which plunder and bloodshed were the objects d. d-

1524.

THE attempt was begun with a force more suited to the Their si 11

humble condition of the three associates, than to the grcatnefs
of the enterprise in which they were engaged. Pizarro set fail Nov. 14.
from Panama. with a tingle vessel, of fmoall burden, and a hun-
dred and twelve men. But in that age, so little were the Spa-
niards acquainted with the peculiarities of climate in America,
that the time which Pizarro chose for his departure was the
most improper in the whole year; the periodical winds, which
were then set in, being dircly adverse to the course which he
purposed to fleer '. After beating about for seventy days, with
much danger and incessant fatigue, Pizarro's progress towards Is-;-
the south-east was not greater than what a skilful navigator will
now make in as many hours. He touched at several places on
the coast of Tierra Firms, but found every where the fame un-
inviting country which former adventurers had dcfcribed; the
low grounds converted into swamps by the overflowing of
rivers; the higher, covered with impervious woods ; few in-
habitants, and those fierce and hoofilc. Famine, fatigue, fre-
quent rencounters with the natives, and, above all, the diflem-
pers of a moist, sultry climate, combined in wafling his ilendcr
band of followers. The undaunted rcfolution of their leader Aicndfe.
continued, however, for some time, to fuflain their spirits, al- !h .f''"
though no sign had yet appeared of difcoviring those golden
regions to which he had promiscd to conduc tlicm. At length,

his soldiers, who, in searching for'their companions, underwent
the fame distresses, and were exposed to the fame dangers, which
had driven them out of the country. Repulsed at length by
the Indians in a sharp conflict, in which their leader 'loft one
of his eyes by the wound of an arrow, 'they likewise were com-
pelled to reimbark. Chance led them to'the place of Pizarro's
ictreat, where they found some consolation in recounting to each
other their adventures, and comparing their sufferings. As Al-
Jure :-. magro had advanced as far as the river St. Juan, in the province

of Popayan, where both the country and inhabitants appeared
with a more promising aflpect, that dawn of better fortune was
sufficient to determine fuich sanguine projecors not to abandon
their feheme, notwithflanding all that they had suffercd in pro-
fecuting it '.

rcinforcelncnt was, they did not hcfitate about rfTmining their
operations. Aftcr a long fciics of difaflers and diflapploiitmcnts,

Emeraulds, they beheld a country more champaign and fertile -
than any they had yet discovered in the Soutlern Ocean, the 15z6
natives clad in garments of woollen or cotton fluff, and adorned
with several trinkets of gold and silver.

BUT, notwithstanding those favourable appearances, magni-

sied beyond the truth, both by the vanity of those who brought
the report from Tacamez, and by the fond imagination of
those who liflened to them, Pizarro and Almagro durst not
venture to invade a country so populous with a handiul of men,
enfeebled by fatigue and diteafes. They retired to the fiall
island of Gallo, where Pizarro remained with part of the troops,
and his associate returned to Panama, in hopes of bringing
such a reinforcement, as might enable them to take pofleffion

though deeply asseted with those measures, which they could
not prevent and durst not oppose, found means of communi-
cating their Sentiments privately to Pizarro, and exhorted him
not to relinquish an enterprise which was the foundation of all
their hopes, and the only means of re-establishing their repu-
tation and fortune, that were both on the decline. Pizarro's
mind, bent with inflexible obstinacy on all its purposes, needed
Perfisls in his no incentive to persist in the scheme. He peremptorily re-

fused to obey the governor of Panama's orders, and employed
all his address and eloquence in persuading his men not to
abandon him. But the incredible calamities to which they
had'been exposed were frill so recent in their memories, and
the thoughts of revisiting their families and friends after a
orig absence, rushed with such joy into their minds, that when
Pizarro drew a line upon the sand with his sword, permitting
such as wiffed to return home to pass over it, only thirteen of
all the daring veterans in his service had resolution to remain.

historians record with deserved praise, as the persons to whose

luable of all its American possessions, fixed their residence in

the coast than Gallo, and uninhabited, they confidered as a
more secure retreat, where, unmolested, they might wait for
supplies from Panama, which they trufled that the ativity of

were not inattentive or cold solicitors, and their inceflant ---
importunity was seconded by the general voice of the colony, ,iz6'
which exclaimed loudly against the infamy of exposing
brave men, engaged in the public service, and chargeable
with no error but what flowed from an excess of zeal and
courage, to perish like the most odious criminals in a desert
island. Overcome by those entreaties and expostulations, the
governor at last conrented to fend a small vessel to their relief.
But that he might not seem to encourage Pizarro to any new
enterprise, he would not permit one land-man to embark on
board of it.

BY this time, Pizarro and his companions had remained five Hardliips he

months in an island, infamous for the most unhealthy climate endure''
in that region of America ". During all this period, their
eyes were turned towards Panama, in hopes of succour from
their countrymen, but worn out at length with fruitless ex-
pecations, and dispirited with suffering hardships of which
they saw no end, they, in despair, came to a resolution of
committing themselves to the ocean on a float, rather than con-
tinue in that detcftable abode. Jut, on the arrival of the vessel
from Panama, they were transported with such joy, that all
their fuLfferings were forgotten. Their hopes revived, and,
with a rapid transition, not unnatural among men accuflomcd
by their nmode of life to lidden viciffitudcs of fortune, high
confidence succeeding to extreme dejeclion, Pizarro easily in-
duced not only his own followers, but the crew of the veflel

Discovers Gorgona, discovered the coast of Peru. After touching at feve-
Peru. ral villages on the coast no wife inviting, they landed at Tum-

bez, a place of some note, above three degrees south of the line,
diflinguifhed for its flately temple, and a palace of the Incas or
sovereigns of the country '. There the Spaniards feasted their
eyes with the first view of the opulence and civilization of the
Peruvian empire. They beheld a country fully peopled, and
cultivated with an appearance of regular industry ; the natives
decently clothed, and possessed of ingenuity so far surpassing
the other inhabitants of the New World, as to have the use of
tame domeflic animals. But what chiefly attracted their notice,
was'fuch a show of gold and silver, not only in the ornaments
of their persons and temples, but in several vessels and utensils
for common use, formed of the fame precious metals, as left
no room to doubt that these abounded with profusion in the
country. Pizarro and his companions seemed now to have
attained to the completion of their most sanguine hopes, and
fancied that all their wishes and dreams of rich domains, and
inexhaustible treasures, would soon be realized.

as far as was requisite to ascertain the importance of the disco-
very, Pizarro procured from the inhabitants some of their
Llamas or tame cattle, to which the Spaniards gave the name of
sheep, Ifme vessels of gold and silver, as well as some fpeci-
mens of their other works of ingenuity, and two young men,
whom he propoled to inftrud in the Caltilian language, that
they might serve as interpreters in the expedition which he me-
ditated. With these he arrived at Panama, towards the close
of the third year from the time of his departure thence"'. No
adventurer of the age suffered hardships or encountered dangers
which equal those to which he was exposed during this long
period. The patience with which he endured the one, and the
fortitude with which he surmounted the other, exceed what-
ever is recorded in the history of the New World, where so,
many romantic displays of those virtues occur.

NEITHER the splendid relation that Pizarro gave of the in-

credible opulence of the country which he had discovered, nor
his bitter complaints on account of that unseasonable recal of

ing any fettlerent tliere, could move the governor of Panama

colony was not in a condition to invade such a mighty empire,
and refused to autliorile an expedition which lie foresaw would

leagues along the coast to the south of the river St. Jago; to be
independent of the governor of Panama; and he had power to
nominate all the officers who were to serve under him. In re-
turn for those concessions, which colt the court of Spain no-
thing, as the enjoyment of them depended upon the success of
his own efforts, Pizarro engaged to raise two hundred and fifty
men, and to provide the ships, arms, and warlike stores requi-
fitc towards fubjecling, to the crown of Castile, the country of
which the government was allotted him.

INCONSIDERABLE as the body of men was, which Pizarro Slenderforce

had undlertaken to raise, his funds and credit were so low that to raire.
he could hardly complete half the number; and after obtain- 15

vately out of the port of Scville, in order to elude the scrutiny
of the officers xvo had it in charge to examine whether he had
fulfilled thc filpulations in his contrad °. Before his departurc,
however, he received fbme fliupply of money from Cortes, who

tribute his aid towards cnabling an ancient companion, with
whose talents and courage he was well acquainted, to begin a
career of glory similar to that which he himself had finished ".

to form a new association, in order to thwart or to rival his for-

more wisdom and address than to susSer a rupture so fatal to all
his schemes, to become irreparable. By offering voluntarily to
relinquish the office of adelantado, and promising to concur in
soliciting that title, with an independent government for Al-
magro, he gradually mitigated the rage of an open-hearted
soldier, which had been violent, but was not implacable. Lu-
que, highly satisfied with having been successful in all his own
pretensions, cordially fecouded Pizarro's endeavours. A recon-
ciliation was efl-ctecd; and the confederacy renewed on its ori-
ginal terms, that the enterprise flould be carried on at the
common expence of the aflociates, and the profits accruing
from it flmould be equally divided among them

thirty-fix of whom were horsemen, composed the armament Tlheir arna-
which they were able to fit out. But the astonishing progress mct"'
of the Spaniards in America had inspired them with such
ideas of their own superiority, that Pizarro did not hesitate to ; ,
fail with this contemptible force to invade a great empire. Al- Febr
magro was left at Panama, as formerly, to follow him with
what reinforcement of men he ihould be able to muster. As the
season for embarking was properly chosen, and the course of
navigation between Panama and Peru was now better known,
Pizarro completed the voyage in thirteen days ; though, by the
force of the winds and currents, he was carried above a hundred
leagues to the north of Tumbez, the place bs his dctination,
and obliged to land his troops in the bay of St. Matthew.
Without losing a moment, he began to advance towards the
south, taking care, however, not to depart far from the sea- Lans i
mhore, both that he might easily effced a junction with the sup- cPru.
plies which he expected from Panama, and secure a retreat in
cafe of any disaster, by keeping as near as possible to his flips.
But as the country in several parts on the coast of Peru is bar-
ren, unliealthful, and thinly peopled; as the Spaniards had to
pals all the rivers near their mouth, where the body of water is
greatefl; and as the imprudence of Pizarro, in attacking the na-
tives when he should have fludied to gain their confidence, had
forced them to abandon their habitations; famine, fatigue, and
diseases of various kinds, brought upon him and his followers
calamities hardly inferior to tholc which they had endured in
their former expedition. What they now experienced corre-
fponded so ill with the alluring dcfcription of the country given
by Pizarro, that many began to reproach him, and every flldicr

April 14. and, having surprised the principal settlement of the natives,

they seized there vessels and ornaments of gold and silver, to
the amount of thirty thousand pesos, with other booty of such
value, as dispelled all their doubts, and inspired the most de-
fponding with sanguine hopes'.

ing with treasure, that lie inflantly dispatched one of his ships to
Panama with a large remittance to Almagro; and another to
Nicaragua with a considerable fum to some persons of influence
in.that province, in hopes of alluring adventurers, by this early
display of the wealth which he had acquired. Meanwhile, he
continued his march along the coast, and disdaining to employ
any means of reducing the natives but force, he attacked them
with such violence in their scattered habitations, as compelled
them either to retire into the interior country, or to submit to
his yoke. This sudden appearance of invaders, whose asped
and manners were so strange, and whose power seemed to be
lb irrefiflible, made the fame dreadful impression as in other
parts of America. Pizarro hardly met with rcfiftance until he
attacked the island of Puna in the bay of Guayquil. As that
was better peopled than the country through which he had
paired, and its inhabitants fiercer and less civilized than those
of the contincnt, they defended themselves with such obstinate
valour, that Pizarro spent fix months in reducing them to sub-
jedion. From Puna he proceeded to Tumbez, where the dif-

WHILE he was thus employed, he began to reap advantage

cially as the one was under the command of Sebastian
Benalcazar, and the other of Hernando Soto, officers not
inferior in merit and reputation to any who had served in
America. From Tumbez he proceeded to the river Piura, and May 16.
in an advantageous flation near the mouth of it, he established
the first Spanish colony in Peru ; to which he gave the name of
St. Michael.

As Pizarro continued to advance towards the centre of the

Peruvian empire, he gradually received more full information
concerning its extent and policy, as well as the situation of its
affairs at that junaure. Without some knowledge of these, he
could not have conducted his operations with propriety; and
wvithout a suitable attention to them, it is impossible to account
for the progress which the Spaniards had already made, or to
'unfold the causes of their subsequent fucccfs.

53 *was originally possessed by small independent tribes, differing

from each other in manners, and in their forms of rude policy.
All, however, were so little civilized, that, if the traditions
concerning their mode of life, preserved among their descend-
ants, deserve credit, they must be classed among the most un-
improved savages of America. Strangers to every species of
cultivation or regular induflry, without any fixed residence,
and unacquainted with those sentiments and obligations which
form the first bonds of social union, they are said to have
roamed about naked in the forests, with which the country
was then covered, more like wild beasts than like men. After
they had struggled for several ages with the hardships and ca-
lamities which are inevitable in this barbarous slate, and when
no circumflance seemed to indicate the approach of any un-
common effort towards improvement, we are told that there
appeared on the banks of the lake Titiaca, a man and woman
of majestic form, and clothed in decent garments. They
declared themselves to be children of the Sun, sent by their
beneficent parent, who beheld with pity the miseries of the
human race, to inflrua and to reclaim them. At their per-
fiafion, enforced by reverence for the divinity in whose name
they were fulppofed to fpeal, several of the difpcrfed savages
united together, and receiving their commands as heavenly in-
juncions, followed them to Cuzco, where they fcttled, and
began to lay the foundations of a city. *

MANCO CAPAC and Mlama Ocollo, for such were the names

of those extraordinary personages, having thus collected some
wandering tribes, formed that lbcial union, which, by multi-
plying the dcfires, and uniting the efforts of the human fpccics,

VI.

instruCted the men in agriculture, and other useful arts. Mama --
Ocollo taught the women to spin and to wveave. By the labour 3
of the one sex, fubfiltence became less precarious; by that of
the other, life was rendered more comfortable. After securing
the objecs of first necefity in an infant ifate, by providing
food, raiment, and habitations for the rude people of whom
he took charge, Manco Capac turned his attention towards in-
troducing such laws and policy as might perpetuate their hap-
piness. By his inltitutions, which shall be more particularly
explained hereafter, the various relations in private life were
eflablifhed, and the duties resulting from them prescribed with
such propriety, as gradually formed a barbarous people to de-
cency of manners. In public administration, the functions of
persons in authority were so precisely defined, and the fubordi-
nation of those under their jurifdiaion maintained with filch a
steady hand, that the society in which he presided, soon aTfumed.
the aspea of a regular and well-governed fate.

THUS, according to the Indian tradition, was founded the

empire of the Inlcas or Lords of Peru. At firfl, its extent was
small. The territory of Manco Capac did not reach above eight
leagues from Cuzco. But within its narrow precincts, he cxer-
cifcd absolute and uncontrolled authority. His ilcccflbrs, as
their dominions expanded, arrogated a Iimilar jurifdiQion over
their subjects: the defpotilf of Asia was not more complete.
The Incas were not only obeyed as monarchs, but revere-d as-
divinities. Their blood was held to be sacred, and, by prohi-
biting intermarriages with the people, was never contaminatcd.
by mixing with that of any other race. The family, thus fcpa-
rated from the rcfl of the nation, was distinguished by peculia-

7 t-iticse

A
-- --' to assume. The monarch himself appeared with ensigns of

royalty reserved for him alone; and received from his fubjedts
marks of obsequious homage and refped, which approached al-
most to adoration.

BUT, among the Peruvians, this unbounded power of their

monarchs seems to have been uniformly accompanied with at-
tention to the good of their fubjecs. It was not the rage of
conquest, if we may believe the accounts of their countrymen,
that prompted the Incas to extend their dominions, but the
desire of diffusing the blessings of civilization, and the know-
ledge of the arts which they possessed, among the barbarous
people whom they reduced. During a succession of twelve
nonarchs, it is said that not one deviated from this beneficent
characer '.

WHEN the Spaniards firit visited the coast of Peru, in

the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-fix, Huana
Capac, the twelfth monarch from the founder of the state,
was feated on the throne. He is represented as a prince
distinguished not only for the pacific virtues peculiar to
the race, but eminent for his martial talents. By his vic-
torious arms the kingdom of Quito was fubjeCLed, a con-
quest of such extent and importance as almost doubled the
power of the Peruvian empire. He was fond of residing in
the capital of that valuable province, whichllhe had added to
his dominions; and, notwithstanding the ancient and funda-
mental law of the monarchy against polluting the royal blood

by any foreign alliance, he married the daughter of the van- B 0 0 l

quifhed monarch of Quito. She bore him a son named Atahual- t-
pa, whom, on his death at Quito, which seems to have happened 5"
about the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-nine, he
appointed his successor in that kingdom, leaving the reft of his
dominions to Huafcar, his eldest son, by a mother of the royal
race. Greatly as the Peruvians revered the memory of a monarch
who had reigned with more reputation and splendour than any of
his predecessors, the destination of Huana Capac concerning the
succession, appeared so repugnant to a maxim coeval with the
empire, and founded on authority deemed sacred, that it was
no sooner known at Cuzco than it excited general difgufl. En-
couraged by those sentiments of his fubjeds, Huafcar required
his brother to renounce the government of Quito, and to ac-
knowledge him as his lawful superior. But it had been the
firfl care of Atahualpa to gain a large body of troops vlhlich had
accompanied his father to Quito. These were the flower of tile
Peruvian warriors, to whose valour Huana Capac had been in-
debted for all his victories. Relying on their support, Atahualpa
first eluded his brother's demand, and then marched againfl him
in hostile array.

Ti-Ius the ambition of two young men, the title of the one

founded on ancient usage, and that of the other aflertcd by the
veteran troops, involved Peru in civil war, a calamity, to
which, under a fuccef]ion of virtuous princes, it liad hitherto
been a firanger. In such a contest, the iltlie was obvious. The
force of arms triumphed over the authority of laws. Atahualpa
remained vicorious, and made a cruel use of his vitory. Con-
f:ious of tlle defcc& in his own title to the crlown, lic attempted
to extcrminate the royal race, by putting to death all the chil-
dren of the Sun deficndcd from Manco Capac, wvhom he could

he made any hoflile attempt in his former visit to Peru in the
year one thousand five hundred and twcnty-feven, lie must then
have encountered the force of a powerful slate, united under a
monarch, possessed of capacity as well as courage, and unem-
barraftcd with any care that could divert him from opposing his
progress. But at this time, the two competitors, though they
received early accounts of the arrival and violent proceedings
of the Spaniards, were so intent upon the operations of a war,
which they deemed more interesting, that they paid no atten-
tion to the motions of an enemy, too inconsiderable in num-
ber, to excite any great alarm, and to whose career, it would
be easy, as they imagined, to give a check when more at
leisure.

BY this fortunate coincidence of events, whereof Pizarro could

and advanced to the centre of a great empire before one effort
of its power was exerted to flop his career. During their pro-
grefs, the Spaniards had acquired some imperfect knowledge of
this struggle between the two contending factions. The first com-

plete information, with refpet to it, they received from mef- B

iengers whom Huafcar sent to Pizarro, in order to solicit his ----
aid against Atahualpa, whom he represented as a rebel and an
usurper ". Pizarro perceived at once the importance of this in-
telligence, and foresaw so clearly all the advantages which might
be derived from this divided slate of thle kingdom, which he had
invaded, that, without waiting for the reinforcement which he
expected from Panama, he determined to push forward, while
intestine discord put it out of the power of the Peruvians
to attack him with their whole force, and while, by taking
part, as circumstances should incline him, with one of the
competitors, he might be enabled with greater cafe to crufli
both. Enterprising as the Spaniards of that age were in all
their operations against Americans, and diftiniguifhed as Pizarro
was among his countrymen for daring courage, we can hardly
suppose, that after having proceeded hitherto slowly, and witl
much caution, he would have changed at once his fyfler of
operation, and have ventured upon a measure so hazardous,
without some new motive or profpea to julify it.

As he was obliged to divide his troops, in order to leave as . ..;

importance as a place of retreat in cafe of any dilafler, and as a

according to the usual artifice of his countrymen in America,
pretended to come as the ambassador of a very powerful mo-
narch, and declared that he was now advancing with an inten-
tion to offer Atahualpa his aid against those enemies who dif-
puted his title to the throne '

-whether they flould confider their new guests as beings of a
superior nature, who had visited them from some beneficent
motive, or as formidable avengers of their crimes, and enemies
to their repose and liberty. The continual profeflions of the
Spaniards, that they came to enlighten them with the know-
ledge of truth, and lead them in the way of happiness, favoured
the former opinion ; the outrages which they committed, their
rapaciousness and cruelty, were awful confirmations of the latter.
WVhile in this slate of uncertainty, Pizarro's declaration of his
pacific intentions so far removed all the Inca's fears, that he
determined to give him a friendly reception. In consequence
of this resolution, the Spaniards were allowed to march in
tranquillity across the fLnldy dclert between St. Michael anrl

From Motupe they advanced towards the mountains lwhich en- ----
compaifed the low country of Peru, and pafied through a defile 151z
so narrow and inaccessible, that a few men might have defended
it againit a numerous army. But here likewise, from the fame
inconsiderate credulity of the Inca, the Spaniards met with no op-
position, and took quiet poffielion of a fort ereded for the fecu-
rity of that important flation. As they now approached near to
Caxamalca, Atahualpa renewed his profcffions of fricndflip;
and as an evidence of their sincerity, fcnt them presents of
greater value than the former.

ON entering Caxamalca, Pizarro took pofl}cfion of a large Arriveat

court, on one fide of which was a house which the Spaninfl
historians call a palace of the Inca, and on the other a temple
of the Sun, the whole surrounded with a lirong rampart or wall
of earth. When he had poiRed his troops in this advantageous
fiation, he dispatched Hernando Soto, and his brother Ferdi-
nand, to the camp of Atahualpa, which was about a league
difiant from the town. He inftlrudced them to confirm the de-
claration which lie had formerly made of his pacific disposition,
and to decire an interview witlh te Inca, that lie might explain

53 3 the vast profusion of wealth which they observed in the Inca's

camp. The rich ornaments worn by him and his attendants,
the vessels of gold and silver in which the repalt offered to theml
was served up, the multitude of utensils of every kind formed
of those precious metals, opened prospects far exceeding any
idea of opulence that a European of the sixteenth century could
form.

Perfidious ON their return to Caxamalca, while their minds were yet

Pizarro. warm with admiration and desire of the wealth which they had

beheld, they gave such a description of it to their countrymen,
as'confirmed Pizarro in a resolution which he had already taken.
From his own observation of American manners during his long
service in the New World, as well as from the advantages which
Cortes had derived from seizing Montezuma, he knew of what
consequence it was to have the Inca in his power. For this
purpose, he formed a plan as daring as it was perfidious. Not-
withflanding the characer he had assumed of an ambassador
from a powerful monarch, who courted an alliance with the
Inca, and in violation of the repeated offers which he had made
to him of his own fricndfhip and affiflance, he determined to
avail himself of the unfufpicious simplicity with which Ata-
liualpa relied on his profeflions, and to seize his pcrfon during
the interview to which he had invited him. He prepared for
the execution of his chlienc with the famne deliberate arrange-
nment, and with as little compunCion, as if it had rcflected no
tlifgrace on liinifelf or ihs country. Ile divided his cavalry into

avenue by which Atahualpa was to approach. Ail were com-
manded to keep within the square, and not to move until the

EARLY in the morning the Peruvian camp was all in mo- Nov. 6.

tion. But as Atahualpa was solicitous to appear with the VifiJtd by
greaterf splendour and magnificence in his first interview with
the strangers, the preparations for this were so tedious, that
the day was far advanced before he began his march. Even
then, left the order of the procession should be deranged, he
moved so slowly, that the Spaniards became impatient and ap-
prehenfive that fime suspicion of their intention might be the
caufc of this delay. In order to remove this, Pizarro clifpatclied
one of his officers with freih afTurances of his friendly difrpoi-
tion. At length the Inca approached. First of all appeared
four hundred men, in an uniform clrefs, as harbingers to clear
the way before him. I-e himself, fitting on a throne or couch,
adorned with plumes of various colours, and almofl covered
with plates of gold and filvcr enriched with precious ftoncs,
was carried on the fioulders of his principal attendants. Behind
him came iomc chief ofliccrs of his court, carried in the fame

he had never heard of them before, and did not now underfland

turning over the leaves, lifted it to his ear: "This," fays he,
"is filcnt; it tells me nothing;" and threw it with disdain
to the ground. The enraged monk, running towards his
countilvyen, cried out, " To arms, Chriflians, to arms; the

He saw the power of his enemies increase; and as he knew

having received a recompence for their services far beyond their
mot sanguine hopes, were so impatient to retire from fatigue
and danger, in order to spend the remainder of their days in their
native country, in ease and opulence, that they demanded their
discharge with clamorous importunity. Pizarro, sensible that
from fuch'm en he could expec neither enterprise in action nor
fortitude in suffering, and persuaded that wherever they went,
the display of their riches would allure adventurers, less opulent

of the temper and address requisite for gaining the confidence

have been derived from being master of his person and autho-
rity. Atahualpa was, indeed, a prince of greater abilities and
discernment than Mlontezuma, and seems to have penetrated
more thoroughly into the charaCter and intentions of the Spa-

prisoner, Pizarro's soldiers would apply whatever treasure
should be acquired, to make up what was wanting of the quan-
tity flipulated for his ransom, and under that pretext exclude
them from any part of it. They insisted eagerly on putting the
Inca to death, that all the adventurers in Peru might thereafter
be on an equal footing '.

Motives PIZARRO himself began to be alarmed with accounts of
ed wizrch io forces affenlbling in the remote provinces of the empire, and
confcnt. fufpeced Atahualpa of having issued orders for that purpose.

These fears and suspicions were artfully increafedby Philippillo,
one of the Indians whom Pizarro had carried off from Tumbez in
the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-feven, and whom
he employed as an interpreter. The funCtion which he performed
admitting this man to familiar intercourse with the captive mo-
narch, he presumed, notwithstanding the meanness of his birth,
to raise his affecions to a Coya, or descendant of the Sun, one of
Atahualpa's wives ; and feeing no profpec of gratifying that
paflion during the life of the monarch, he endeavoured to fill the
ears of the Spaniards with such accounts of his secret designs
and preparations, as might awaken their jcaloufy and incite
them to cut him off.

tached himself with peculiar affcaion to Ferdinand Pizarro and B V0 K
Hernando Soto; who, as they were persons of birth and edu- '----
cation superior to the rough adventurers with whom they '3
served, were accustomed to behave with more decency and at-
tention to the captive monarch. Soothed with this refpe&
from persons of such high rank, he delighted in their society.
But in the presence of the governor lie was uneasy, and over-
awed. This dread soon came to be mingled with contempt.
Among all the European arts, what he admired most was that
of reading and writing; and he long deliberated with himself,
whether he should regard it as a natural or acquired talent. In
order to determine this, lie desired one of the soldiers, who
guarded him, to write the name of God on the nail of his thumb.
This he fliewed successively to several Spaniards, asking its
meaning; and to his amazement, they all, without hesitation,
returned the fame answer. At length Pizarro entered ; and on
presenting it to him, he bluthed, and with some confusion was
obliged to acknowledge his ignorance. From that moment,
Atahualpa conlidered him as a mean person, less inflruccdl
than his own soldiers ; and he had not address enough to con-
ceal the Centiments with which this discovery infpiecd him. To
be the object of a barbarian's scorn, not only mortified the pride
of Pi,.arro, but excited such resentment in his breafl, as acdded

B o 1C try tle Inca with all the formalities observed in the criminal

----- courts of Spain. Pizarro himself, and Almagro, with two
5 33 afifinants, were appointed judges, with full power to acquit

or to condemn ; an attorney-general was named to carry on
the prosecution in the king's narme; counsellors were chosen to
afifit the prisoner in his defence; and clerks were ordained to
record the proceedings of court. Before this strange tribunal,
a charge was exhibited Itill more amazing. It consisted of va-
rious articles; that Atahualpa, though a baflard, had difpoffefied
the rightful owner of the throne, and usurped the regal power;
that he had put his brother and lawful sovereign to death ; that
he was an idolater, and had not only permitted, but commanded
the offering of human facrifces; that he had a great number of
concubines; that since his ilnprilonmcnt he had wased and em-
bezzled the royal trealfires, which now belonged of right to the
conquerors; that he had incited his flujecs to take arms againfl
the Spaniards. On these heads of accusation, some of wliich
are to ludicrous, others io absurd, that the effrontery of
Pizarro, in making them the foundation of a serious proce-
dure, is not les surprising than his injultice, did the court
go on to try the fovcreign of a great empire, over whom it
had no jurifdidion. \Vith rcfped to eacl of the articles, wit-
neflcs were examined ; but as they delivered their evidence in
their native tongue, Philippillo had it in his power to give their
words whatever turn bell lifited his malevolent intentions.
Tojudges predetermined in their opinion, this cv ldence appeared

Ic is con- fiuflicicnt. They pronounced Atallualpa guilty, and condemned
demnncj. Iihim to be burnt alive. Friar Valverdle proltitutcd the autho-

rity of Ilis sacrcd function to confirmr this (entcnce, and by his
fignaturc warranted it to be jflt. Aflonilicd at his fate,
Atahualpa endeavoured to avert it by tears, by promires, and

by entreaties, that he might be sent to Spain, where a monarch B 0 li
would be the arbiter of his lot. But pity never touched the

l -----

unfeeling heart of Pizarro. He ordered him to be led instantly
to execution; and what added to the bitterness of his last
moments, the fame monk who had just ratified his doom, of-
sered to console, and attempted to convert him. The most
powerful argument Valverdi employed to prevail with him to
embrace the Christian faith, was a promise of mitigation in
his punishment. The dread of a cruel death extorted from the
trembling vicim a desire of receiving baptifin. The ceremony
was performed; and Atahualpa, instead of being burnt, was and exccc,,:
firangled at the stake ".

HAPPILY for the credit of the Spanish nation, even among several Spn-

the profligate adventurers which it sent forth to conquer and "nias piott"tt"
desolate the New \World, there were persons who retained some
tincture of the Castilian generosity and honour. Though, before
the trial of Atahualpa, Ferdinand Pizarro had set out for Spain,
and Soto was sent on a separate command at a distance from Cax-
amalca, this odious tranfaation was not carried on without ccnfure
and opposition. Several ofliccrs, and among those some of the
i*reateft reputation and most rcfpeflable families in the service,
not only remolflrated, but protefled against this meafLirc of their
general, as disgraceful to their country, as repugnant to every

Difrolutionof ON the death of Atahualpa, Pizarro inverted one of his sons

Peru. experience might prove a more passive initrument in his hands,

than an ambitious monarch, who had been accustomed to inde-
pendent command. The people of Cuzco, and the adjacent
country, acknowledged Manco Capac, a brother of Huafcar,
as Inca P. But neither possessed the authority which belonged
to a sovereign of Peru. The violent convulsions into which
the empire had been thrown, first by the civil war between the
two brothers, and then by the invasion of the Spaniards, had
not only deranged the order of the Peruvian government, but
almost dissolved its frame. When they beheld their monarch
a captive in the power of strangers, and at last suffering an ig-
nominious death, the people in several provinces, as if they had
been set free from every restraint of law and decency, broke
out into the most licentious excesses q. So many descendents of
the Sun, after being treated with the utmost indignity, had been
cut off by Atahaulpa, that not only their influence in the slate
diminished with their number, but the accustomed reverence
for that iacred race sensibly decreased. In consequence of this

aspired to independent authority, and usurped jurisdiction to ---
which they had no title. The general who commanded for 5s33.
Atahualpa in Quito, seized the brother and children of his
master, put them to a cruel death, and disclaiming any con-
necion with either Inca, endeavoured to eftablifi a separate
kingdom for himself'.

THE Spaniards, with pleasure, beheld the spirit of discord Pizarro ad

diffusing itself, and the vigour of government relaxing among vance, to
the Peruvians. They confidered those disorders as symptoms
of a slate hastening towards its dissolution. Pizarro no longer
hesitated to advance towards Cuzco, and he had received such
considerable reinforcements, that he could venture, with little
danger, to penetrate so far into the interior part of the country.
The account of the wealth acquired at Caxamalca, operated as
he had foreseen. No sooner did his brother Ferdinand, with
the officers and soldiers, to whom he had given their discharge
after the partition of the Inca's ransom, arrive at Panama,
and display their riches in the view of their aflonifhed country-
men, than fame spread the account with such exaggeration
through all the Spanish settlements on the South Sea, that the
governors of Guatimala, Panama, and Nicaragua, could hard-
ly restrain the people under their jurifdiclion, from abandon-
ing their polleflions, and crowding to that inexhaufiible foilrce
of wealth which seemed to be opened in Peru . In fpiCt of
every check and regulation, such numbers resorted thither,

5 33- some large bodies of troops to oppose his progress. Several

fierce encounters happened. But they terminated, like all the
ations in America; a few Spaniards were killed or wounded;
the natives were put to flight with incredible slaughter. At
length Pizarro forced his way to Cuzco, and took quiet pof-
session of that capital. The riches found there, even after all
that the natives had carried off and concealed, either from a
superstitious veneration for the ornaments of their temples, or
out of hatred to their rapacious conquerors, exceeded in value
what had been received as Atahualpa's ransom. But as the
Spaniards were now accustomed to the wealth of the country,
and it came to be parcelled out among a greater number of ad-
venturers, this dividend did not excite the fame surprise either
from novelty, or the largeness of the urn that fell to the ihare
of each individual'.

Pizarro treated as Inca, died, and as the Spaniards substituted

settlement entrufled to his care, he placed himself at the head ---
of the reft, and set out to attempt the reduction of Quito, i5333
where, according to the report of the natives, Atahualpa had
left the greatest part of his treasure. Notwithstanding the vast
diflance of that city fiom St. Michael, the difficulty of march-
ing through a mountainous country covered with woods, and
the frequent and fierce attacks of the best troops in Peru, com-
manded by a skilful leader, the valour, good conduct, and per-
ieverance of Benalcazar surmounted every obstacle, and he en-
tered Quito with his vicorious troops. But they met with a
cruel mortification there. The natives, now acquainted, to
their sorrow, with the predominant pafion of their invaders,
and knowing how to disappoint it, had carried off all those
treasures, the profpea of which had prompted them to tlnder-
take this arduous expedition, and had supported them under all

VI.

_ -

_ kingdom of Quito did not lie within the limits of the province
'533. allotted to Pizarro, he resolved to invade it. The high repu-

tation of the commander allured volunteers from every quarter.
He embarked with five hundred men, of whom above two hun-
dred were of such diflintion as to serve on horseback. He
landed at Puerto Viejo, and without sufficient knowledge of
the country, or proper guides to conduct him, attempted to
march directly to Quito, by following the course of the river
Guayquil, and crossing the ridge of the Andes towards its
head. But in this route, one of the molt impracticable in all
America, his troops endured such fatigue in forcing their way
through forests and marshes on the low grounds, and suffered
fo-much from excessive cold when they began to ascend the
mountains, that before they reached the plain of Quito, a fifth
part of the men and half of their horses died, and the rcft were
so much dispirited and worn out, as to be almost unfit for ser-
vice Y. There they met with a body, not of Indians but of
Spaniards, drawn up in hoflile array against them. Pizarro,
having receivcd an account of Alvarado's armament, had de-
tached Almagro with some troops to oppose this formidable in-
vader of his jurifdidion; and there were joined by Benalcazar
and his victorious party. Alvarado, though surprised at the
fight of enemies whom he did not expect, advanced boldly to
the charge. But, by the interposition of some moderate men
in each paity, an amicable accommodation took'place; and the
fatal period, when Spaniards suspended their conquests to em-

to oppose him. Each of the contending parties was supported
by powerful adherents, and the dispute was on the point of
being tcrminated by the sword, when Francis Pizarro arrived
in the capital. The reconciliation between him and Almagro
had never been cordial. The treachery of 'izarro in engrossing
to hiimfelf all the honours and emoluments, which ought to have
been divided with his aiTociate, was always present in both
tlheir thoughts. The one, conscious of his own perfidy, did
not expeEt forgivencfs; the other, feeling that he had been
decevied, was impatient to be avenged ; and though avarice
and ambition had induced them not only to diflemble their fen-
timents, but even to aa in concert while in pursuit of wealth
and power, no sooner did they obtain poffeiion of these, than
the fame passions which had formed this temporary union,
gave rife to jealousy and discord. To cach of them was at-
tached afmall band ofintcrefled dependents, who, with the ma-
licious art, peculiar to fucli men, heightened their fuifpicions,
and magnified every appearance of offence. 13ut with all those

This new agreement, though confirmed with the fame sacred so-

fidelity '.

SOON after he concluded this important tranfation, Pizarro Regulations

marched back to the countries on the sea coast, and as he now f lizrro0
enjoyed an interval of tranquillity, undisturbed by any enemy,
either Spanish or Indian, he applied himself with that perse-
vering ardour, which distinguishes his character, to introduce a
form of regular government into the extensive provinces sub-
jed to his authority. Though ill qualified by his education to
enter into any disquisition concerning the principles of civil
policy, and little accustomed by his former habits of life to
attend to its arrangements, his natural sagacity supplied the
want both of science and experience. He difiributcd the coun-
try into various diflri&ts; he appointed proper magistrates to
preside in each; and cfrablifhcd rcgulations concerning the ad-
miiinifration ofjufice, the colleition of the royal revenue, the

VI.
---» situated in a corner of the empire, above four hundred miles

5S34. from the sea, and much farther from Quito, a province of whose

value he had formed an high idea. No other settlement of the
Peruvians was so considerable as to merit the name of a town,
or to allure the Spaniards to fix their residence in it. But, in
marching through the country, Pizarro had been struck with the
beauty and fertility of the valley of Rimac, one of the most
extensive and best cultivated in Peru. There, on the banks of
a small river, of the fame name with the vale which it waters
and enriches, at the distance of fix miles from Callao, the most
commodious harbour in the Pacific Ocean, he founded a city
which he destined to be the capital of his government. He gave
January 18. it the name of Ciudad de los Reyes, either from the circum-

seance of having laid the first stone, at that season when the
church celebrates the festival of the Three Kings, or, as is more
probable, in honour of Juana and Charles, the Sovereigns of
Castile. This name it still retains among the Spaniards, in all
legal and formal deeds; but it is better known to foreigners by
that of Lima, a corruption of the ancient appellation of the valley
in which it is situated. Under his infpeaCion, the buildings
advanced with such rapidity, that it soon assumed the form of
a city, which, by a magnificent palace that he ereced for him-
fclf, and by the fiately houses built by several of his officers,
gave, even in its infancy, some indication of its subsequent
grandeur '

less liberality and fearless courage, his itandard was followed by ..--
five hundred and seventy men, the greatest body of Europeans
that had hitherto been assembled in Peru. From impatience
to finish the expedition, or from that contempt of hardship and
danger acquired by all the Spaniards who had served long in
America, Almagro, inflead of advancing along the level coun-
try on the coast, chose to march across the mountains by a route
that was shorter indeed, but almost impracticable. In this at-
tempt his troops were exposed to every calamity which men can
susser, from fatigue, from famine, and from the rigour of the
climate in those elevated regions of the torrid zone, where the
degree of cold is hardly inferior to what is felt within the polar
circle. Many of them perished; and the survivors, when they
descended into the fertile plains of Chili, had new difficulties to
encounter. They found there a race of men very different from
the people of Peru, intrepid, hardy, independent, and in their
bodily constitution, as well as vigour of spirit, nearly refem-
bling the warlike tribes in North America. Though filled with
wonder at the first appearance of the Spaniards, and flill more
aflonifhed at the operations of their cavalry and the effecs of
their fire-arms, the Chilefe soon recovered so far from their
surprise, as not only to defend themselves with obstinacy, but
to attack their new enemies with more determined fierccners
than any American nation had hitherto discovered. The Spa-
niards, however, continued to penetrate into the country, and
colleced some considerable quantities of gold; but were so far
from thinking of making any settlement amidst such formi-
dable neighbours, that, in spite of all the experience and valour
of their leader, the final issue of the expedition fill remained
extremely dubious, when they were recalled from it by an un-

An infurrec- So many adventurers had flocked to Peru from every Spa-
tionsofthe s ith h colony in America, and all with such high expectations of

accumulating independent fortunes at once, that, to men pof-
sessed with notions so extravagant, any mention of acquiring
wealth gradually, and by schemes of patient indufiry, would
have been not only a disappointment, but an insult. In order
to find occupation for men who could not with safety be allowed
to remain inactive, Pizarro encouraged some of the most diftin-
guifhed officers who had lately joined him, to invade different
provinces of the empire, which the Spaniards had not hitherto
visited. Several large bodies were formed for this purpose;
aid about the time that Almagro set out for Chili, they marched'
Its rife, into remote diflrias of the country. No sooner did Manco Capac,

the Inca, observe the inconsiderate security of the Spaniards in
thus dispersing their troops, and that only a handful of men
remained in Cuzco, under Juan and Gonzalez Pizarro, than he
thought that the happy period was at length come for vindicat-
ing his own rights, avenging the wrongs of his country, and
extirpating its oppressors. Though firidly watched by the Spa-
niards, who allowed him to reside in the palace of his ancestors
at Cuzco, he found means of communicating his scheme to the
persons who were to be entrusted with the execution of it.
Among people accufromed to revere their sovereign as a divi-
nity, every hint of his will carries the authority of a command;
and they themfclves were now convinced, by the daily increase
in the number of their invaders, that the fond hopes which

thecy

they had long entertained of their voluntary departure were
altogether vain. All perceived that a vigorous effort of the
whole nation was requilite to expel them, and the preparations
for it were carried on with the secrecy and silence peculiar to
Americans.

AFTER some unsuccessful attempts of the Inca to make his

escape, Ferdinand Pizarro happening to arrive at that time in
Cuzco, he obtained permission from him to attend a great fefti-
val which was to be celebrated a few leagues from the capital.
Under pretext of that solemnity, the great men of the empire
were assembled. As soon as the Inca joined them, the standard
of war was ereced; and in a flort time all the fighting men,
from the confines of Quito to the frontier of Chili, were in arms.
Many Spaniards, living securely on the settlements allotted
them, were massacred. Several detachments, as they marched
carelessly through a country which seemed to be tamely fubmif-
five to their dominion, were cut off to a man. An army amount-
ing (if we may believe the Spanilh writers) to two hundred
thousand men attacked Cuzco, which the three brothers endea-
voured to defend with only one hundred and seventy Spaniards.
Another formidable body inverted Lima, and kept the governor
closely slut up. There was no longer any communication be-
tween the two cities; the numerous forces of the Peruvians
spreading over the country, intercepted every mefienger; and
as the parties in Cuzco and Lima were equally unacquainted
with the fate of their countrymen, each boded the worlt con-
cerning the other, and imagined that they themliclves were the
only persons who had survived the general extinlion of the
Spinifl name in Peru ".

Co. forms; and though they displayed not the fame undaunted fe-

rocity as the Mexican warriors, they conducted some of their
operations in a manner which discovered greater sagacity, and a
genius more susceptible of improvement in the military art.
They not only observed the advantages which the Spaniards
derived from their discipline and their weapons, but they en-
deavoured to imitate the former, and turn the latter againfl
them. They armed a considerable body of their bravest war-
riors with the swords, the spears, and bucklers, which they had
taken from the Spanish soldiers whom they had cut off in dif-
ferent parts of the country. These they endeavoured to marshal
in-that regular compaa order, to which experience had taught
them that the Spaniards were indebted for their irresistible force
in action. Some appeared in the field with Spanish muskets,
and had acquired skill and resolution enough to use them. A
few of the boldest, among whom was the Inca himself, were
mounted on the horses which they had taken, and advanced
briskly to the charge like Spanish cavaliers, with their lances
in the reft. It was more by their numbers, however, than by
those imperfeCt essays to imitate European arts, and employ
European arms, that the Peruvians annoyed the Spaniards'.
In spite of the valour, heightened by despair, with which the
three brothers defended Cuzco, Manco Capac recovered posses-
fioa of one half of his capital; and before the Spaniards could
drive him out of it, they loft Juan Pizarro, the belt beloved of
all the brothers, together with some other persons of note.

their way to the lea, and finding tome means of escaping from
a country which had been so fatal to the Spanish name f. While
they were brooding over those desponding thoughts, which their
officers laboured in vain to dispel, Almagro appeared suddenly
in the neighbourhood of Cuzco.

THE accounts transmitted to Almagro concerning the general Arrival of

insurrection of the Peruvians, were such as would have induced
him, without hesitation, to relinquish the conquest of Chili,
and haflen to the aid of his countrymen. But in this resolution
he was confirmed by a motive less generous, but more interest- and motives
ing. By the fame messenger who brought him intelligence of ds" conl
the Inca's revolt, he received the royal patent creating him go-
vernor of Chili, and defining the limits of hisjurifdicion. Upon
confidering the tenor of it, he deemed it manifest beyond con.
tradicion, that Cuzco lay within the boundaries of his govern-
ment, and he was equally solicitous to prevent the Peruvians
from recovering poffcTion of their capital, and to wreff it out of
the hands of the Pizarros. From impatience to accomplish both
he ventured to return by a new route; and in marching through
the sandy plains on the coafl, he suffered, from heat and
drought, calamities of a new species, hardly inferior to those
in which he had been involved by cold and famine on the
summits of the Andes.

or to take precautions against him as an enemy. The latter,
knowing the points in contest between him and his country-
men, flattered themselves that they had more to hope than to
dread from his operations. Almagro himself, unacquainted
with the detail of the events which had happened in his ab-
fence, and solicitous to learn the precise poflure of affairs,
advanced towards the capital slowly, and with great circum-
fpesion. Various negotiations with both parties were set on
foot. The Inca conducted them on his part with much address.
At first he endeavoured to gain the friendihip of Almagro;
and after many fruitless overtures, despairing of any cordial
union with a Spaniard, he attacked him by surprise with a nu-
merous body of chosen troops. But the Spanish discipline and
valour maintained their wonted superiority. The Peruvians
were repulsed with such slaughter, that a great part of their
army dispersed, and Almagro proceeded to the gates of Cuzco

Francis Pizarro having dispersed the Peruvians who had in- magro,

from Hispaniola and Nicaragua, ordered five hundred men,
under the command of Alonfo de Alvarado, to march to Cuzco,
in hopes of relieving his brothers, if they and their garrison
were not already cut off by the Peruvians. This body, which,
at that period of the Spanifli power in America, must be
deemed a considerable force, advanced near to the capital before
they knew that they had any enemy more formidable than In-
dians to encounter. It was with aflonifhment that they beheld
their countrymen posted on the banks of the river Abancay to
oppose their progress. Almagro, however, wiflcd rather to

advantages. two rivals mutt have been decided, if Almagro had known as

well how to improve as how to gain a vitory. Rodrigo Or-
gognez, an officer of great abilities, who having served under
the constable Bourbon, when he led the Imperial army to Rome,
had been accustomed to bold and decisive measures, advised him
instantly to issue orders for putting to death Ferdinand and
Gonzalo Pizarros, Alvarado, and a few other persons whom
he could not hope to gain, and to march direCtly with his vic-
torious troops to Lima, before the governor had time to pre-
pare for his defence. But Almagro, though he discerned at
once the utility of the counsel, and had courage to have
carried it into execution, suffered himself to be influenced
by sentiments unlike those of a soldier of fortune grown
old in service, and by scruples which suited not the chief of
a party who had drawn his sword in civil war. Feelings of
humanity restrained him from shedding the blood of his
opponents; and the dread of being deemed a rebel, deterred him
from entering a province which the king had allotted to another.
Though he knew that arms must terminate the dispute between
him and Pizarro, and rcfolvcd not to shun that mode of dcci-

PIZARRO was still unacquainted with all the interesting Dijrofs of

events which had happened near Cuzco. Accounts of Alma- Paro.
gro's return, of the loss of the capital, of the death of one bro-
ther, of the imprisonment of the other two, and of the defeat
of Alvarado, were brought to him at once. Such a tide of
misfortunes almost overwhelmed a spirit which had continued
firm and eret under the rudest shocks of adversity. But the
necessity of attending to his own safety, as well as the desire of
revenge, preserved him from finking under it. He took mea-
fures for both with his wonted sagacity. As he had the corn- His artfil
mand of the sea-coast, and expected considerable supplies both condu,.
of men and of military flores, it was no less his interest to gain
time, and to avoid action, than it was that of Almagro to pre-
cipitate operations, and bring the contest to a speedy issue. He
had recourse to arts which he had formerly practised with fuc-
cess, and Almagro was again weak enough to susser himself to
be amused with a profped of terminating their differences by
some amicable accommodation. By varying his overtures, and
shifting his ground as often as it suited his purpose, sometimes
seeming to yield every thing that his rival could desire, and
then retracing all that he had granted, Pizarro dexterously pro-
tratcd the negociation to such a length, that though every day
was precious to Almagro, several months elapsed without coming
to any final agreement. While the attention of Almagro, and
of the officers with whom he consulted, was occupied in de-
tefing and eluding the fraudulent intentions of the governor,
Gonzalo Pizarro and Alvarado found means to corrupt the fol-

undisturbed possession of whatever part of the country he now
occupied; that Ferdinand Pizarro should be set at liberty, and
return infaantly to Spain, together with the officers, whom
Almagro purposed to fend thither to represent the juflice of his
claims. Obvious as the design of Pizarro was in those propo-
fitionis, and familiar as his artifices might now have been to his
opponent, Almagro, with a credulity approaching to infatua-
tion, relied on his sincerity, and concluded an agreement on

mand of these was given to his two brothers, in whom he B 00 K
could perfectly confide for the execution of his most violent --
ichemes, as they were urged on, not only by the enmity flow- 3.
ing from family rivalfhip, but animated with the desire of ven-
geance, excited by recollection of their own recent disgrace and
sufferings. After an unsuccessful attempt to cross the inoun-
tains in the direct road between Lima and Cuzco, they march-
ed towards the south along the coast as far as Nafca, and then
turning to the left, penetrated through the defiles in that branch
of the Andes which lay between them and the capital. Alma-
gro, inftcad of hearkening to some of his officers, who advised
him to attempt the defence of those difficult passes, waited the
approach of the enemy in the plain of Cuzco. Two reasons
seem to have induced him to take this resolution. His followers
amounted hardly to five hundred, and he was afraid of weak-
ening such a feeble body, by fending any detachment towards
the mountains. I-is cavalry far exceeded that of the adverse
party, both in number and discipline, and it was only in an
open country that he could avail himself of that advantage.

he was so worn out with the fatigues of service, to which his
advanced age was unequal, that, at this crisis of his fate, he
could not exert his wonted a&ivity; and he was obliged to
commit the leading of his troops to Orgognez, who, though
an officer of great merit, did not possess the fame ascendant
either over the spirit or affections of the soldiers, as the chief
whom they had long been accustomed to follow and revere.

counterbalanced by Pizarro's superiority in numbers, and by
two companies of well-difciplined musketeers, which, on re-
ceiving an account of the infurretion of the Indians, the em-
peror had sent from Spain . As the use of fire-arms was not
frequent among the adventurers in America", hastily equipped
for service, at their own expence, this small band of soldiers,

were massacred in cold blood; above a hundred and forty fol- TV
diers fell in the field; a large proportion, where the number of 38
combatants were few, and the heat of the contest soon over.
Almagro, though so feeble that he could not bear the motion
of a horse, had insisted on being carried in a litter to an emi-
nence which overlooked the field of battle. From thence, in
the utmost agitation of mind, he viewed the various move-
ments of both parties, and at last beheld the total defeat of his
own troops, with all the passionate indignation of a veteran
leader long accustomed to victory. He endeavoured to save and ta'en.
himself by flight, but was taken prisoner, and guarded with the

THE Indians, instead of executing the resolution which they

had formed, retired quietly after the battle was over; and in
the history of the New World, there is not a more striking in-
stance of the wonderful ascendant which the Spaniards had
acquired over its inhabitants, than that after feeing one of the
contending parties ruined and dispersed, and the other weak-
ened and fatigued, they had not courage to fall upon their ene-

to gratify such extravagant expectations, had recourse to the
fame expedient which his brother had employed on a similar
occasion, and endeavoured to find occupation for this turbulent
assuming spirit, in order to prevent it from breaking out into
open mutiny. With this view, he encouraged his most ac-
tive officers to attempt the discovery and reduction of various
provinces which had not hitherto submitted to the Spaniards.
To every Standard ereced by the leaders who undertook any of
those new expeditions, volunteers resorted with the ardour and
hope peculiar to the age. Several of Almagro's soldiers joined
themn, and thus Pizarro had the satisfaction of being delivered
both from the importunity of his discontented friends, and the
dread of his ancient enemies q.

under all the anguish of fufpence. For although his doom was
determined by the Pizarros from the moment that he fell into
their hands, prudence confirained them to defer gratifying
their vengeance, until the soldiers who had served under him,
as well as several of their own followers in whom they could not
perfetly confide, had left Cuzco. As soon as they set out upon
their different expeditions, Almagro was impeached of treason,
condemned, formally tried, and condemned to die. The sentence astonished

him, and though he had often braved death with an undaunted
spirit in the field, its approach under this ignominious form
appalled him so much, that he had recourse to abject fupplica-

mities, and to susser him to pass the wretched remainder of his
days in bewailing his crimes, and in making his peace with
Heaven. The intreaties, fays a Spanish historian, of a man so
much beloved, touched many an unfeeling heart, and drew tears
from many a hard eye. But the brothers remained inflexible.

As, during the civil dissensions in Peru, all intercourse with

Spain was suspended, the detail of the extraordinary tranfac-
tions there did not ibon reach the court. Unfortunately for the
victorious faction, the first intelligence was brought thither
by some of Almagro's officers, who left the country upon the

' rived soon after, and appeared in court with extraordinary
'5 39 splendor, endeavoured to efface the impression which their ac-

cufations had made, and to justify his brother and himself by
representing Almagro as the aggressor. The emperor and his
minifrers, though they could not pronounce which of the con-
tending factions was most criminal, clearly discerned the fatal
tendency of their dissensions. It was obvious, that while the
leaders, entrusted with the conduc of two infant colonies, em-
ployed the arms which should have been turned againPt the com-
mon enemy, in destroying one another, all attention to the public
good must cease, and there was reason to dread that the Indians
might improve the advantage which the disunion of the Spaniards
presented to them, and extirpate both thevitors and the vanquish-
ed. But the evil was more apparent than the remedy. Where the
information which had been received was so defective and fufpi-
cious, and the scene of action io remote, it was almost impoflible
to chalk out the line of conduc that ought to be followed; and
before any plan that should be approved of in Spain could be
carried into execution, the situation of the parties, and the cir-
cumfiances of affairs, might alter so entirely as to render its
effects extremely pernicious.

in his operations. According to the different afpecQ of affairs,
he had power to take upon him different characters. If he
found the governor fill alive, he was to assume only the title
of judge, to maintain the appearance of acting in concert with
him, and to guard againlt giving any just cause of offence to a
man who had merited so highly of his country. But if Pi-
zarro were dead, he was entrusted with a commission that
he might then produce, by which he was appointed his fuc-
ceflbr in the government of Peru. This attention to Pizarro,
however, seems to have flowed rather from dread of his power,
than from any approbation of his measures; for at the very
time that the court feerned so oflicitous not to irritate him, his
brother Ferdinand was arrefled at Madrid, and confined to a
prison, where he remained above twenty years '.

WXVHLE Vaca de Cafiro was preparing for his voyage, events 40

impartiality, the extent of country which he had to bestow was sus-
ficient to have gratified his friends, and tohave gained his enemies.
But Pizarro conducted this tranfadion not with the equity and
candour of a judge attentive to discover and to reward merit,
but with the illiberal spirit of a party leader. Large dillricts,
in parts of the country most cultivated and populous, were fct

whom were many of the original adventurers to whose valour
and perseverance Pizarro was indebted for his success, were
totally excluded from any portion in those lands, towards the ac-
quifition of which they had contributed so largely. As the vanity
of every individual set an immoderate value upon his own ser-
vices, and the idea of each concerning the recompence due to
them rose gradually to a more exorbitant height in proportion as
their conquefis extended, all who were disappointed in their ex-
pectations exclaimed loudly against the rapaciousness and parti-
ality of the governor. The partisans of Almagro murmured in
secret, and meditated revenge'.

minion was not yet satisfied. The officers to whom Ferdinand
Pizarro gave the command of different detachments, penetrated
into several new provinces, and though some of them were ex-
posed to great hardships in the cold and barren regions of the
Andes, and others suffered diflrefs not inferior amidst the woods
and marshes of the plains, they made discoveries and conquests
which extended their knowledge of the country as well as added
to their power. Pedro de Valdivia re-affumed Almagro's
scheme of invading Chili, and notwithstanding the fortitude of
the natives in defending their possessions, made such progress
in the conquest of the country, that he founded the city of
St. Jago, and gave a beginning to the eflabliihment of the Spa-

from Quito at the head of three hundred and forty soldiers,
near one half of whom were horsemen, with four thousand In-
dians to carry their provisions. In forcing their way through

B 0 0 K continual scarcity of food, seem more than sufficient to have

VI. A.--,--' exhausted and dispirited any troops. But the fortitude and
s1540 perseverance of Spaniards in the sixteenth century were infupe-

rable. Allured by frequent but false accounts of rich coun-
tries before them, they persisted in firuggling on, until they
reached the banks of the Coca or Napo, one of the large rivers
whose waters pour into the Maragnon, and contribute to its
grandeur. There, with infinite labour, they built a bark,
which they expeEted would prove of great utility, both in con-
veying them over rivers, in procuring provisions, and in ex-
ploring the country. This was manned with fifty soldiers,
under the command of Francis Orellana, the officer next in
rank to Pizarro. The stream carried them down with such
rapidity, that they were soon far a-head of their countrymen,
who followed slowly and with difficulty by land.

Deserted by AT this diflance from his commander, Orellana, a young
Orellana. man of an aspiring mind, began to fancy himself independent,

and transported with the predominant pafion of the age, he
formed the scheme of distinguishing himself as a discoverer, by
following the course of the Maragnon, until it joined the ocean,
and by surveying the vast regions through which it flows.
This scheme of Orellana's was as bold as it was treacherous.
For, if he be chargeable with the guilt of having violated his
duty to his commander, and with having abandoned his fellow-
soldiers in a pathless desert, where they had hardly any hopes of
fucccfs, or even of safety, but what were founded on the service
which they expefted from the bark; his crime is, in tome measure,
balanced by the glory of having ventured, upon a navigation of
near two thousand leagues, through unknown nations, in a vcflel
haflily conflruScd, with green timber, and by very unskilful

hIands,

hands, without provisions, without a compass, or a pilot. But B O0 K
his courage and alacrity supplied every defec. Committing -
himself fearlessly to the guidance of the stream, the Napo Sails down
bore him along to the south, until he reached the great channel the Marag-

.non.

of the Maragnon. Turning with it towards the coafi, he held
on his course in that direction. He made frequent descents on
both fides of the river, fornetimes seizing by force of arms the
provisions of the fierce savages feated on its banks; and sometimes
procuring a supply of food by a friendly intercourse with more
gentle tribes. After a long series of dangers which he encoun-
tered with amazing fortitude, and of distresses which he sup-
ported with no less magnanimity, he reached the ocean , where
new perils awaited him. These he likewise surmounted, and
got safe to the Spanish settlement in the island Cubagua, from
thence he failed to Spain. The vanity natural to travellers
who visit regions unknown to the reft of mankind, and the
art of an adventurer, solicitous to magnify his own merit,
concurred in prompting him to mingle an extraordinary pro-
portion of the marvellous in the narrative of his voyage. He
pretended to have discovered nations so rich, that the roofs of
their temples were covered with plates of gold ; and described
a republic of women so warlike and powerful, as to have ex-
tended their dominion over a considerable trat of the fertile
plains which he had visited. Extravagant as tliof tales were,
they gave rife to an opinion, that a region abounding with gold,
diflinguifhed by the name of El Dorado, and a community of
Amazons, were to be found in this part of the New Worldl;
and such is the propensity of mankind to believe what is
wonderful, that it has been slowly and with difficulty, that

memorable occurrences in that adventrous age, but as the first

gions that firetch eastward from the Andes to the ocean'.

Distress of No words can describe the contfernation of Pizarro, when
Pizarro. he did not find the bark at the confluence of the Napo and

Maragnon, where he had ordered Orellana to wait for him.
He would not allow himself to fufped that a man, whom he
had entrutfed with such an important command, could be so
base and so unfeeling, as to desert him at fuich a junture. But
imputing his absence from the place of rendezvous to some
unknown accident, he advanced above fifty leagues along the
banks of the Maragnon, expecting every moment to fee the
~541. bark appear with a supply of provisions. At length he came

up with an officer whom Orellana had left to perifl in the
desert, because he had the courage to remonfirate againlt his
perfidy. From him he learned the extent of Orellana's crime,
and his followers perceived at once their own defperatc lituation,
when deprived of their only relource. The spirit oi rite fiouteft

and even to gnaw the leather of their saddles and fword-belts.
Four thousand Indians, and two hundred and ten Spaniards pe-
rifhed in this wild disastrous expedition, which continued
near two years; and as fifty men were aboard the bark with
Orellana, only fourscore got back to Quito. These were naked

longer entertained any hope of bettering their condition. Great
numbers in despair resorted to Lima, where the house of young
Almagro was always open to them, and the slender portion of
his father's fortune, which the governor allowed him to enjoy,
was spent in affording them subsistence. The warm attachment
with which every person who had served under the elder Al-

to his son, who was now grown up to the age of manhood,

or from contempt of persons whose poverty feerned to render
their machinations of little consequence, he disregarded the ad-
monitions of his friends. " Be in no pain, said he carelessly,

Peru knows that I can in a moment put him to death who
dares to harbour a thought against it'" This security gave the

had the charge of Almagro's education, took the lead in their
consultations, with all the zeal which this connecion inspired, 54.'
and with all the authority which the ascendant that he was
known to have over the mind of his pupil gave him.

ON Sunday, the twenty-fixth of June, at mid-day, the sea- and kill him,

son of tranquillity and repose in all sultry climates, Herrada,
at the head of eighteen of the most determined conspirators,
rallied out of Almagro's house in complete armour; and draw-
ing their swords, as they advanced hastily towards the governor's
palace, cried out, " Long live the king, but let the tyrant die."
Their associates, warned of their motions by a signal, were in
arms at different ltations ready to support them. Though
Pizarro was usually surrounded by such a numerous train of
attendants as suited the magnificence of the most opulent sub-
jec of the age in which he lived, yet as he was juss risen from
table, and most of his domeflics had retired to their own apart-
ments, the conspirators passed through the two outer courts of
the palace unobserved. They were at the bottom of the flair-
cafe, before a page in waiting could give the alarm to his
mafler, who was converting with a few friends in a large hall.
The governor, whose flcddy mind no form of danger could ap-
pal, flarting up, called for arms, and commandcd Francisco dle
Chavcs to make fapl the door. But that olficcr, who did not
retain so much preltnce of mind as to obey this prudent order,
running to the top of the flair-cafe, wildly afkced the confpira-
tors what they meant, and whither they were going. Inflcad
of answering, they flabbcd him to the heart, and burflt into the
hall. Some of the pcribns who were there threw themselves
from the windows; others attempted to fly; and a few draw-

-----', The conspirators, animated with having the object of their

' vengeance now in view, rufled forward after them. Pizarro,

with no other arms than his sword and buckler, defended the
entry, and supported by his half brother Alcantara, and his
little knot of friends, he maintained the unequal contest with
intrepidity worthy of his past exploits, and with the vigour of
a youthful combatant. " Courage, cried he, companions, we
are yet enow to make those traitors repent of their audacity."
But the armour of the conspirators protected them, while every
thrust they made took effect. Alcantara fell dead at his bro-
ther's feet; his other defenders were mortally wounded. The
governor, so weary that he could hardly wield his sword, and
no longer able to parry the many weapons furiously aimed at
him, received a deadly thrust full in his throat, funk to the
ground, and expired.

favour of Almagro, and he was soon at the head of eight
hundred of the most gallant veterans in Peru. As his youth
and inexperience disqualified him from taking the command
of them himself, he appointed Herrada to ad as general. But
though Almagro speedily colleted such a refpeclable force,
the acquiescence in his government was far from being general.
Pizarro had left many fiiends to whom his memory was dear;
the barbarous aflafination of a man to whom his country was
so highly indebted, filled every impartial person with horror.
The ignominious birth of Almagro, as well as the doubtful
title on which he founded his pretensions, led others to con-
fider him as an usurper. The officcrs who commanded in
some provinces refused to recognize his authority, until it was
confirmed by the emperor. In others, particularly at Cuzco,

venge the murder of their ancient leader.

of his arrival and of his commifion, he communicated to his
countrymen the royal pleasure with respect to the government
of the country. By private emissaries, he excited such officers
as had discovered their disapprobation of Almagro's proceed-
ings, to manifest their duty to their Sovereign by supporting
the person honoured with his commission. Those measures
were produCtive of great effecs. Encouraged by the approach
of the new governor, or prepared by his machinations, the loyal
were confirmed in their principles, and avowed them with
greater boldness; the timid ventured to declare their sentiments;
the neutral and wavering, finding it necessary to chute a fide,
began to lean to that which now appeared to be the safest as
well as the most just'.
Conduaotf ALMAGRO observed the rapid progress of this spirit of dif-

Atl;g. affection to his cause, and in order to give an effeEtual check

of his troops for Cuzco, where the most considerable body of . _
opponents had erected the royal standard, under the command 54
of Pedro Alvarez Holguin. During his march thither, Her-
rada, the skilful guide of his youth and of his counsels, died ;.
and from that time his measures were conspicuous for their
violence, but concerted with little sagacity, and executed with
no address. Holguin, who, with forces far inferior to those of
the opposite party, was descending towards the coast at the very
time that Almagro was on his way to Cuzco, deceived his un-
experienced adversary by a very simple firatagem, avoided an,
engagement, and effected a junction with Alvarado, an officer
of note, who had been the first to declare against Almagro as
an usurper,..

standard before his own tent, he declared, that, as governor, he
would discharge in person all the funCtions of general of their.
combined forces. Though formed by the tenour of his pafl life
to the habits of a sedentary and pacific profession, he at once
assumed the activity and discovered the decision of an officer long
accustomed to command. Knowing his firength to be now far
superior to that of the enemy, he was impatient to terminate
the contest by a battle. Nor did the followers of Almagro,.
who had no hopes of obtaining pardon for a crime so atrocious
as the murder of the governor, decline that mode of decision.
They met at Chupas, about two hundred miles from Cuzco, Sct. 16..
and fought with all the fierce animosity inspircd by the violence
of civil rage, the rancour of private enmity, the cagcrnefs of
revenge, and the last efforts of despair. ViCtory, after re-

maining

maining long doubtful, declared at last for Vaca de Castro.
The superior number of his troops, his own intrepidity, and
the martial ta'lents of Francisco de Carvajal, a veteran officer
formed under the great captain in the wars of Italy, and who
on that day laid the foundation of his future fame in Peru,
triumphed over the bravery of his opponents, though led on
by young Almagro with a gallant spirit, worthy of a better
cause, and deserving another fate. The carnage was great in
proportion to the number of the combatants. Many of the
vanquished, especially such as were conscious that they might
be charged with being accessory to the assassination of Pizarro,
ruffling on the swords of the enemy, chose to fall like soldiers,
rather than wait an ignominious doom. Of fourteen hundred
men, the total amount of combatants on both fides, five hun-
dred lay dead on the field, and the number of the wounded was
fill greater d.

IF the military talents displayed by Vaca de Castro, both in

the council and in the field, surprised the adventurers in Peru,
they were flill more astonished at his conduct after the victory.
As he was by nature a rigid dispenser ofjuflice, and persuaded
that it required examples of extraordinary severity to restrain
the licentious spirit of soldiers so far removed from the feat of
government, he proceeded diretly to try his prisoners as rebels.
Forty were condemned to susser the death of.-traitors, others
were banished from Peru. Their leader, who made his escape
from the battle, being betrayed by some of his officers, was

and the latter the most ambitious, was encumbered with fucli
a multiplicity of fcliemcs, and involved in war with so many

-- their right. The plunder of the countries which they invaded
A542. served to indemnify them for what they had expended in

equipping themselves for the service, and the conquered ter-
ritory was divided among them, according to rules which cuf-
tom had introduced, as permanent establishments which their
successful valour merited. In the infancy of those settlements,
when their extent as well as their value were unknown, many
irregularities escaped observation, and it was found necessary
to connive at many excefles. The conquered people were pil-
laged with defRrucive rapacity, and their country parcelled out
among its new maflers in exorbitant shares, far exceeding the
highest recompence due to their services. The rude conquerors
of America, incapable of forming their establishments upon any
general or extensive plan of policy, attentive only to private
interest, unwilling to forego present gain from the profped of
remote or public benefit, seem to have had no objeCt but to
amass sudden wealth, without regarding what might be the
consequences of the means by which they acquired it. But
when time at length discovered to the Spanish court the im-
portance of its American possessions, the necessity of new-
modelling their whole frame became obvious, and in place of
the maxims and practices prevalent among military adven-
turers, it was found requisite to substitute the institutions cf
regular government.

ONE evil in particular called for an immediate remedy.

The conquerors of Mexico and Peru imitated the fatal example
of their countrymen fettled in the islands, and employed them-
selves in Icarching for gold and silver with the fame inconsiderate
eagerncfs. Similar effct:s followed. The natives employed im

this

this labour by masters, who in imposing their tasks had no re- B 0
gard either to what they felt or to what they were able to per- --
form, pined away and perilhed so fast, that there was reason
to apprehend that Spain, instead of poffefling countries peopled
to such a degree as to be susceptible of progressive improvement,
would soon remain proprietor only of a vast uninhabited defart.

THIE emperor and his ministers were so sensible of this, and

so solicitous to prevent the extinction of the Indian race, which
threatened to render their acquisitions of no value, that from
time to time various laws, which I have mentioned, had been
made for securing to that unhappy people more gentle and
equitable treatment. But the distance of America from the
feat of empire, the feebleness of government in the new colo-
nies, the avarice and audacity of soldiers unaccustomed to re-
ftraint, prevented there salutary regulations from operating with
any considerable influence. The evil continued to grow, and
at this time the emperor found an interval of leisure from the
affairs of Europe to take it into attentive consideration. He The perfont
consulted not only with his ministers and the members of the 'vithl whom

council of the Indies, but called upon several persons who had
resided long in the New WVorld, to aid them with the rcfult of
their experience and observation. Fortunately for the people
of America, among there was Bartholomew de las Casas, who
happened to be then at Madrid on a miflion from a chapter of
his order at Chiapa r. Though, since the micarriage of his
former schemes for the relief of the Indians, he had continued
fluit up in his cloifler, or occupied inl religious funations, his
zeal in behalf of the former olbjcts of his pity was f) far from
abating, that, from an increased knowlcdge of their futfferings,

B O K its ardour had augmented. He seized eagerly this opportunity

V.
. -. _of reviving his favourite maxims concerning the treatment of
542 the Indians. With the moving eloquence natural to a man on

whole mind the scenes which he had beheld had made a deep
impression, he described the irreparable waste of the human
species in the New World, the Indian race almost totally swept
away in the islands in less than fifty years, and hastening to
extinction on the continent with the fame rapid decay. With
the decisive tone of one strongly prepofleffed with the truth of
his own system, he imputed all this to a single cause, to the
exations and cruelty of his countrymen, and contended that
nothing could prevent the depopulation of America, but the
declaring of its natives to be freemen, and treating them as
fuibjets, not as slaves. Nor did he confide for the success of
this proposal in the powers of his oratory alone. In order to
enforce them, he composed his famous treatise concerning the
deftruaion of America g, in which he relates, with many hor-
rid circumstances, but with apparent marks of exaggerated de-
scription, the devastation of every province which had been
visited by the Spaniards.

His fo!icitntde TH-Ii emperor was deeply affliied with the recital of so many
to introduce
a general re- actions shocking to humanity. But as his views extended far
fornatinn of beyond tho(e of .las Cafis, he perceived that relieving the In-

polleflions in the New \Vorld a valuable acq(lilieion, and would

returned, gave umbrage to an age not accustomed to fee men in
inferior condition elevated above their level, and riling to ernm- 't'
late or to surpass the ancient nobility in splendour. The terri-
tories which their leaders had appropriated to themnfelvcs were
of such enormous extent ', that if the country fhoulcl ever be im-
proved in proportion to the fertility of the foil, they mufl grow
too wealthy and too powerful for fubjccts. It appeared to
Charles, that this abuse required a remedy no lecs than the
other, and that the regulations concerning both mufi be en-
forced by a mode of government more vigorous than had yet
been introduced into America.

WITH this view he framed a body of laws, containing many Nwiv rc, I,-

of the supreme council of the Indies; concerning the flation
and jurifdifion of the royal audiences in different parts of Ame-

both ecclefiaflical and civil. These were approved of by all
ranks of men. But together with them were iflied the fol-
lowing regulations, which excited universal alarm, and occa-

quainted with the state of the country, remonfirated against
those regulations, as ruinous to their infant colonies. They
represented, that the number of Spaniards who had hitherto
emigrated to the New \Vorld was so extremely small, that no-
thing could be expected from any effort of theirs towards im-
proving the vast regions over which they were scattered; that
the success of every scheme for this purpose must depend upon
the ministry and service of the Indians, whose native indolence
and aversion to labour, no profpeEt of benefit or promire of
reward could surmount; that the moment the right of im-
posing a tafc, and exacting the performance of it, was taken
from their masters, every work of industry mufl cease, and all
the sources from which wealth begun to pour in upon Spain
muif be flopt for ever. But Charles, tenacious at all times of
his own opinions, and so much impressed at present with the
view of the disorders which reigned in America, that he was
willing to hazard the application even of a dangerous remedy,
perfifled in his resolution of publiufing the laws. That they
might be carried into execution with greater vigour and au-

thority, he authorised Francisco Tello de Sandoval to repair to
Mexico as viftador or superintendent of that country, and to
co-operate with Antonio de Mendoza, the viceroy, in enforcing
them. He appointed Blasco Nugnez Vela to be governor of
Peru, with the title of Viceroy; and in order to strengthen his
administration, he established a court of royal audience in Lima,
in which four lawyers of eminence were to preside as judges k.

THE viceroy and superintendent failed at the fame time;

and an account of the laws which they were to enforce reached
America before them. The entry of Sandoval into Mexico
was viewed as the prelude of general ruin. The unlimited
grant of liberty to the Indians affeaed every Spaniard in Ame-
rica without diftinlion, and there was hardly one who might
not on some pretext be included under the other regulations,
and susser by them. But the colony in New Spain had now
been so long accustomed to the restraints of law and authority
under the fleddy and prudent adminifiration of Mendoza, that
how much soever the spirit of the new flatutes was detelled and
dreaded, no attempt was made to ol)ftrutd the publication of
them by any ac of violence unbecoming fuhljects. The magi-
firates and principal inhabitants, however, presented dutiftll
addresses to the viceroy and fuperintcndent, representing the
fatal confcquenccs of enforcing them. Happily for them,
Mendoza, by long residence in the country, was so thoroughly
acquainted with its slate, that lhe knew what was for its intcrcef
as well as what it could bear; and Sandoval, though new in

apprehenflons of his iuljcds in New Spain with refpet to
their tendency and effecLs, but they concurred with them in
supporting their fentimciuts. Charles, moved by the opinion
of men whose abilities and integrity intitled them to decide
concerning what fell immediately under their own view, granted
such a relaxation of the rigour of the laws as re-eflablifhed the
colony in its former tranquillity
in Peru. IN Peru the storm gathered with an asped still more fierce

and threatening, and was not o ftoon dispersed. The conquer-
ors of Peru, of a rank much inferior to those who had sub-
jested Mexico to the Spanish crown, farther removed from the
infpetion of the parent state, and intoxicated with the fuddcn
acquisition of wealth, carried on all their operations with greater
licence and irregularity than any body of adventurers in the
New World. Amidfi the general subversion of law and order,
occasioned by two fucceflive civil wars, when each individual
was at liberty to decide for himself, without any guide but his
own interest or pailions, this turbulent spirit rose above all sense
of filbordination. To men thus corrupted by anarchy, the in-
troduction of regular government, thle power of a viceroy, and
the authority of a refplecable court of judicature, would have
appeared formidable rcllraints, to which they would have ulb-
mittcd with reluctance. ]But they revolted t xitll indignation

how they might oppose the entrance of the viceroy and judges,

the address of Vaca de Castro, who flattered them with hopes,
that, as soon as the viceroy and judges ihould arrive, and had
leisure to examine their petitions and remonitrances, they
would concur with them in endeavouring to procure some mi-
tigation in the rigour of laws which had been framed with-
out due attention either to the slate of the country, or to the
sentiments of the people. A greater degree of accommodation
to these, and even some concessions on the part of govern-
ment, were now become requisite to compose the present ser-
ment, and to sooth the colonists into submission, by inspiring
them with confidence in their superiors. But without pro-

himself merely as an executive officer, without any discretionary ~-----
power; and, regardless of whatever he observed or heard con-
cerning the slate of the country, he adhered to the letter of the
regulations with unrelenting rigour. In all the towns through
which he passed, the natives were declared to be free, every
person in public office was deprived of his lands and servants;
and as an example of obedience to others, he would not susser
a tingle Indian to be employed in carrying his baggage in his
march towards Lima. Amazement and consternation went be-
fore him as he approached; and so little solicitous was he to
prevent them from augmenting, that, on entering the capital, he
openly avowed that he came to obey the orders of his sovereign,
not to dispense with his laws. This harsh declaration was ac-
companied with what rendered it still more intolerable, haugh-
tiness in deportment, a tone of arrogance and decision in dif-
course, and an insolence of office grievous to men little accuf-
tomed to hold civil authority in high refped. Every attempt
to procure a suspension or mitigation of the new laws, the
viceroy confidered as flowing from a spirit of disaffection that
tended to rebellion. Several persons of rank were confined,
and some put to death, without any form of trial. Vaca de
Castro was arrefled, and notwithflanding the dignity of his

'4 vided with a leader of credit and eminence to unite and to

direct their efforts. From the time that the purport of the new
regulations was known in Peru, every Spaniard there turned
his eyes towards Gonzalo Pizarro, as the only person able to
avert the ruin with which they threatened the colony. From
all quarters, letters and addresses were sent to him, conjuring
him to stand forth as their common protector, and offering to
support him in the attempt with their lives and fortunes.
Gonzalo, though inferior in talents to his other brothers,
was equally ambitious, and of courage no less daring. The
behaviour of an ungrateful court towards his brothers and him-
self, dwelt continually on his mind, Ferdinand a state prisoner
in Europe, the children of the governor in custody of the vice-
roy, and sent aboard his fleet, himself reduced to the condition
of a private citizen in a country, for the discovery and conquest
of which Spain was indebted to his family. These thoughts
prompted him to seek for vengeance, and to assert the rights
of his family, of which he now confidered himself as the guar-
dian and the heir. But as no Spaniard can easily surmount
that veneration for his sovereign which is interwoven in his
frame, the idea of marching in arms againfl the royal standard
filled him with horror. He hesitated long, and was fill unre-
solved, when the violence of the viceroy, tlieuniverfal call of
his countrymen, and the certainty of becoming loon a viatim
himself to the fcverity of the new laws, moved him to quit his
residence at Chuquifaca de la Plata, and repair to Cuzco. All
the inhabitants went out to meet him, and received him with
transports of joy, as the deliverer of the colony. In the fervour
of their zeal, they clelced him procurator general of the Spa-

nifh nation in Peru, to solicit the repeal of the late regulations.
They empowered him to lay their remonfirances before the
royal audience in Lima, and upon pretext of danger from the
Indians, authorised him to march thither in arms. Under
fandion of this nomination Pizarro took poficffion of the royal
treasure, appointed officers, levied soldiers, seized a large train
of artillery which Vaca de Castro had deposited in Guamanga,
and set out for Lima, as if he had been advancing against a
public enemy. Difaffedion having now assumed a regular
form, and being united under a chief of such a diflinguifhed
name, many persons of note resorted to his standard; and a
considerable part of the troops railed by the viceroy to oppose
his progress, deserted to him in a body P.

BEFORE Pizarro reached Lima, a revolution had happened

there, which encouraged him to proceed with almost certainty
of success. The violence of the viceroy's administration was
not more formidable to the Spaniards of Peru than his over-
bearing haughltinfs was odious to his aftociatcs, the judges of
the royal audience. During their voyage from Spain, some
symptoms of coldncfs began to appear '. But as soon as they
entered upon the exercise of thei refi cpeive offices, both par-

preme direCtion of affairs into their own hands, issued a procla-
mation suspending the execution of the obnoxious laws, and
sent a message to Pizarro, requiring him, as they had already
granted whatever he could request, to dismiss his troops, and to
repair to Lima with fifteen or twenty attendants. They could
hardly expeCt that a man so daring and ambitious would tamely
comply with this requisition. It was made, probably, with no
such intention, but only to throw a decent veil over their own
condu&t; for Cepeda, the president of the court of audience, a
pragmatical and aspiring lawyer, seems to have held a secret
correspondence with Pizarro, and had already formed the plan,
which he afterwards executed, of devoting himself to his ser-
vice. The imprisonment of the viceroy, the usurpation of the
judges, together with the universal confusion and anarchy con-
sequent upon events so singular and unexpected, opened new
and vast profpeds to Pizarro. He now beheld the supreme
power within his reach. Nor did he want courage to pufli on
towards the object which fortune presented to his view. Car-
vajal, the prompter of his resolutions, and guide of all his
aclions, lhad long fixed his eye upon it as the only end at

within a mile of Lima, where there was neither leader nor 54
army to oppose him, such a request carried with it the authority
of a command. But the judges, either from unwillingners to
relinquish power, or from a desire of preserving some attention
to appearances, hesitated, or seemed to hesitate, about comply-

military, and he entered the town that day with extraordinary

and resumed his funCtions of viceroy. Several persons of note,
to whom the contagion of the seditious spirit which reigned at
Cuzco and Lima had not reached, instantly avowed their refo-
lution to support his authority'. The violence of Pizarro's go-
vernment, who observed every individual with the timid jea-
lousy natural to usurpers, and punified every appearance of
difaffecdion with rigour, soon augmented the number of the
viceroy's adherents, as it forced some leading men in the colony
to .fly to him for refuge. While he was gathering such
strength at Tumbez, that his forces began to assume the ap-
pearance of what was confidered as an army in America, Diego
Centeno, a bold and aaive officer, exasperated by the cruelty
and oppression of Pizarro's lieutenant-governor in the province
of Charcas, formed a conspiracy against his life, cut him off,
and declared for the viceroy '.

enemy who was nearest as well as most formidable. As he was
master of the public revenues in Peru, and mofl of the military
men were attached to his family, his troops were so numerous,
that the viceroy,. unable to face them, retreated towards Quito.

Pizarro followed him, and in that long march, through a wild B 00 I
mountainous country, but suffered hardships and encountered .--
difficulties, which no troops but those accustomed to serve in
America, could have endured or surmounted °. The viceroy had
scarcely reached Quito, when the van-guard of Pizarro's forces
appeared, led by Carvajal, who, though near fourscore, was as
hardy and aCtive as any young soldier under his command.
Nugnez Vela inflantly abandoned a town incapable of defence,
and with a rapidity more resembling a flight than a retreat,
marched into the province of Popayan. Pizarro continued to
pursue, but finding it impossible to overtake him, returned to
Quito. From thence he dispatched Carvajal to oppose Centeno,
who was growing formidable in the southern provinces of the
empire, and he himself remained there to make head againit
the viceroy ".

fell, pierced with many wounds; and the rout of his followers
became general. They were hotly pursued. His head was
cut off, and placed on the public gibbet in Quito, which Pi-
zarro entered in triumph. The troops assembled by Centeno
were dispersed soon after by Carvajal, and he himself compelled
to fly to the mountains, where he remained for several months
concealed in a cave. Every person in Peru, from the frontiers
of Popayan to those of Chili, submitted to Pizarro; and by his
fleet, under Pedro de Hinojofa, he had not only the unrivalled
command of the South-Sea, but had taken possession of Pana-
ma, and placed a garrison in Nombre de Dios, on the opposite

licitude concerning the part that he ought now to take. Car- B o0 K
vajal, no less bold and decisive in counsel than in the field, '----
had from the beginning warned Pizarro, that in the career on 1
which he was entering, it was vain to think of holding a
middle course; that he must either boldly aim at all, or attempt
nothing. From the time that Pizarro obtained possession of
the government of Peru, he inculcated the fame maxim with
greater earnestness. Upon receiving an account of the victory
at Quito, he remonstrated with him in a tone till more per-
emptory. " You have usurped (said he, in a letter written to
Pizarro on that occasion) the supreme power in this country,
in contempt of the emperor's commission to another. You
have marched, in hostile array, againif the royal tfandard;
you have attacked the representative of your Sovereign in the
field, have defeated him, and cut off his head. Think not that
ever a monarch will forgive such insults on his dignity, or that
any reconciliation with him can be cordial or sincere. De-
pend no longer on the precarious favour of another. Assume
yourself the sovereignty over a country, to the dominion of
which your family has a title founded on the rights both of
discovery and conquest. It is in your power to attach every
Spaniard in Peru of any consequence inviolably to your inte-
reft by liberal grants of lands and of Indians, or by infti-
tuting ranks of nobility, and creating titles of honour similar
to those which are courted with so much eagerness in Europc.
By establishing orders of knighthood, with privileges and
diftinaions resembling those in Spain, you may beflow a gra-
tification upon the officcrs in your fcrvice, suited to the ideas of
military men. Nor is it to your countrymen only that you
ought to attend; endeavour to gain the natives. I3y marry-
ing the Coya, or daughter of the Sun next in fucccflion to the

support of your authority. Thus, at the head of the anci-
ent inhabitants of Peru, as well as of the new settlers there,
you may set at defiance the power of Spain, and repel with
ease any feeble force which it can fend at such a distance."
Cepeda, the lawyer, who was now Pizarro's confidential coun-
fellor, warmly fecondedl Carvajal's cxhortations, and employed
whatever learning he polc:fe(td in (lemonflrating, that all the
founders of great monarchies had been raised to pre-eminence,
not by the antiquity of their lineage, or the validity of their
rights, but by their own astiring valour and pcrfonai
merit ".

those maxims of duty which men are accustomed to hold

du&, and of the state of the country, as might induce the em-
peror and his miniflers, either from inclination or from necef-
fity, to continue him in his present station.

WHILE Pizarro was deliberating with refped- to the part

which he should take, consultations were held in Spain, with
no less solicitude, concerning the nmcafures which ought to be
pursued in order to re-eflablifh the emperor's authority in
Peru. Though unacquainted with the last excesses of outrage to
which the malcontents had proceeded there, tlhe court had re-
ceived an account of the infuirredion againfl the viceroy, of
his impriionmeiit, and the uiurpation of the government by
Pizarro. A revolution so alarming, called for an immnediate
interposition of the emperor's abilities and authority. Iut as
lie was fully occupied at that time in Germany, in conduct-
ing the war againfi the famous league of Smalkalde, one of
the mofl intcrefting and arduous enterprises in his reign, tlic
care of providing a remedy for the disorders in Peru devolved
upon his ton Philip, and the counsellors whom Charles had ap-
pointed to affill him in the government of Spain during his
absence. At first view, the actions of Pizarro and his adllc-
rents appeared so repugnant to the duty of fubjcEs towards
their lovercitni, that the greater part of the minillcrs inliflcd
on declaring them inflantly to be guilty of rebellion, and on
p1roceeding to punilf them with exemplary rigour. I3ut \wlihen

B 0 0 K successive monarchs, could not easily equip an armament of

sufficient force to reduce Pizarro. To transport any refpedable
1546. body of troops to a country so remote as Peru, appeared almost

impossible. While Pizarro continued maifer of the South-Sea,
the direE route by Nombre de Dios and Panama was impraci-
cable. An attempt to march to Quito by land through the new
kingdom of Granada, and the province of Popayan, across
regions of vafi extent, desolate, unhealthy, or inhabited by
fierce and hostile tribes, would be attended with unfurmount-
able danger and hardships. The passage to the South-Sea
by the Straits of Magellan was so tedious, so uncertain,
and so little known in that age, that no confidence could be
placed in any effort carried on in a course of navigation so
remote and precarious. Nothing then remained but to relin-
qulfh the system which the ardour of their loyalty had first
suggested, and to attempt by lenient measures what could not
be effected by force. It was manifest from Pizarro's solicitude
to represent his conduct in a favourable light to the emperor,
that, notwithstanding the excesses of which he had been guilty,
he still retained sentiments of veneration for his sovereign. By
a proper application to these, together with some such concef-
sions as should discover a spirit of moderation and forbearance
in government, he might be yet reclaimed, or the ideas of loy-
alty natural to Spaniards might so far revive among his fol-
lowers, that they would no longer lend their aid to uphold his
usurped authority.

E success, however, of this negociation, no less delicate than

pointed tore- it was important, depended entirely on the abilities and addrcfs

pair to t'eru
as prcfidcnt. of the person to whom it should be committed. After weigh-

ing with much attention the comparative merit of various per-

2, rfons,
246

sons, the Spanish ministers fixed with unanimity of choice, upon B 0°° K
Pedro de la Gafca, a priest in no higher station than that of coun- .- ,
fellor to the inquisition. Though in no public office, he had been
occasionally employed by government in affairs of trust and con-
sequence, and had conduded them with no less ikill than fuc-
cess; displaying a gentle and insinuating temper, accompanied
with much firmness; probity, superior to any feeling of private
interefi; and a cautious circumfpetion in concerting measures,
followed by such vigour in executing them, as is rarely found
in alliance with the other. These qualities marked him out
for the fundcion to which he was destined. The emperor, to
whom Gafca was not unknown, warmly approved of the choice,
and communicated it to him in a letter, containing expressions
of good-will and confidence, no less honourable to the prince
who wrote, than to the subjed who received it. Gafca, notwith-
flanding his advanced age and feeble constitution, and though,
from the apprehensions natural to a man, who, during the
course of his life, had never been out of his own country,
he dreaded the effecs of a long voyage, and of an unhealthy
climate a, did not hesitate a moment about complying with the
will of his fovcreign. In order to shew that it was from this His mode-
principle alone that he adcd, he refused a bifflopric which ration.
was offered to him, in order that he might bear a more
dignified charater ; he would accept of no higher title than
that of president of the court of audience in Lima; and
declared that he would receive no salary on account of his
discharging the duties of that office. All he required was, that
the expence of supporting his family should be defrayed by
the public, and as he was to go like a minister of peace witlh

The powers BUT -while he discovered such disinterested moderation with

jim. refpeEt to whatever related personally to hinruelf, he demanded

his official powers in a very different tone. He infifled, as
he was to be employed in a country so remote from the feat of
government, where he could not have recourse to his sovereign
for new inftrulions on every emergence; and as the whole
success of his negociations must depend upon the confidence
which the people with whom he had to treat could place in
the extent of his powers, that he ought to be invelted with un-
limited authority, that'his jurifdiition mull reach to all persons
and to all causes; that he must be empowered to pardon, to pu-
ninl, or to reward, as circumstances and the behaviour of dif-
ferent men might require; that, in cafe of refiflance from the
malcontents, he might be authorised to reduce them to obedi-
ence by force of arms, to levy troops for that purpose, and to
call for assistance from the governors of all the Spanish fettle-
ments in America. These powers, though manifestly conducive
to the great objects of his mifion, appeared to the Spanifl
ministers to be inalienable prerogatives of royalty, which ought
not to be dclegated to a subjef:, and they refused to grant
them. But. the cmpcror's views were more enlarged. As

to the full extent that he demanded. Highly satisfied with this ,-

fiderable body of men, to oppose the landing of any hoflile
forces. But Gafca appeared in fiuch pacific guise, with a train
so little formidable, and with a ticie of no such dignity as to
excite terror, that he was received with much refped. From
Nombre de Dios he advanced to Panama, and met with a fimi-
lar reception from Hinojofa, whom Pizarro had entrusted with
the government of that town, and the command of his fleet
flationed there. In both places he held the fame language,
declaring that he was sent by their sovereign as a meflenger
of peace, not as a minifler of vengeance; that he came to re-
dress all their grievances, to revoke the laws which had ex-
cited alarm, to pardon pafl offences, and to re-eflablifh order
and justice in the government of Peru. His mild deportment,
the simplicity of his manners, the fanaity of his profeflion,
and a winning appearance of candour, gained credit to his
declarations. The veneration due to a person clothed with
legal authority, and ating in virtue of a royal commission,
began to revive among mcn accuflomcd for tome time to no-
thing more respectable than an usurped jurifdiiAion. Hinojofa,

Violent pro- THIS the violence of Pizarro soon afforded them. As soon
ceedings of
Pizarro. as he heard of Gafca's arrival at Panama, though he received,

at the fame time, an account of the nature of his commifion,
and was informed that he offered to render every Spaniard in
Peru cafy concerning what was past, by an act of general
oblivion; and secure with refpeE to the future, by repealing
the obnoxious laws; inflead of accepting with gratitude his
sovereign's gracious conceflions, he was so much exasperated
on finding that he was not to be continued in his flation
as governor of the country, that he instantly resolved to op-
pose the president's entry into Peru, and to prevent his ex-
ercifing any jurifdiaion there. To this desperate resolution
he added another highly preposterous. He sent a new de-
putation to Spain to jufify this conduet, and to insist, in name
of all the communities in Peru, for a confirmation of the go-
vernment to himself during life, as the only means of pre-
serving tranquillity there. The persons entrusted with this
strange commiflion, intimated the intention of Pizarro to the
president, and required him, in his name, to depart from Pa-
nama and return to Spain. They carried likewise secret in-
ftrutions to H-inojofa, directing him to offer Gafca a prefcnt
of fifty thousand pesos, if he would comply voluntarily with
what was demanded of him ; and if he should continue obftinatc,
to cut him off either by affafination or poilbn'.

MANY

MANY circumstances concurred in pushing on Pizarro to B O O.i

those wild measures. Having been once accustomed to the '---.i

pre-eminence of supreme command, he could not bear the Gafca gains
thoughts of dcfcending to a private station. Conscious of his his f
own demerit, he fufpeaded that the emperor studied only to de-
ceive him, and would never pardon the outrages which he had
committed. His chief confidents, no less guilty, entertained
the fame apprehensions. The approach of Gafca without any
military force excited no terror. There were now above fix
thousand Spaniards fettled in Peru '; and at the head of
these he doubted not to maintain his own independence, if the
court of Spain should refuse to grant what he required. But
he knew not that a spirit of defection had already begun to
spread among those whom he trusted most. Hinojofa, amazed
at Pizarro's precipitate resolution of setting himself in opposition
to the emperor's commission, and disdaining to be his inftru-
ment in executing the odious crimes pointed out in his secret
inftrucions, publicly recognized the title of the president to the
supreme authority in Peru. The officers under his command
did the fame. Such was the contagious influence of the exam-
pie, that it reached even the deputies who had been sent from
Peru; and at the time when Pizarro expected to hear either of
Gafca's return to Spain, or of his death, he received an account
of his being master of the fleet, of Panama, and of the troops
flationed there.

acting as a judge in virtue of the royal commission, did not
scruple to prostitute the dignity of his funcion by finding Gafca
guilty of treason, and condemning him to death on that account 9.
Wild, and even ridiculous, as this proceeding was, it imposed
on the low illiterate adventurers, with whom Peru was filled,
by the femblanoe of a legal fanaion warranting Pizarro to carry
on hostilities against a convited traitor. Soldiers accordingly
retorted from every quarter to his standard, and he was soon
at the head of a thousand men, the befl equipped that had ever
taken the field in Peru.

Preparations GASCA, on his part, perceiving that force muff be employed
of Gafca. in order to accomplish the purpose of his million, was no less

afliduous in collecting troops from Nicaragua, Carthagena, and
other settlements on the continent; and with such success, that
he was loon in a condition to detach a squadron of his fleet,
April. with a confiderahle body offoldiers, to the coast of Peru. Their

appearance excited a dreadful alarm; and though they did not
attempt for some time to make any descent, they did more es-
fectual service, by setting aihore in different places persons who
difpiered copies of the act of general indemnity, and the revo-
cation of the late edicts; and who made known every where the
pacific intentions, as well as mild temper, of the president.

proaching by sea, and another by land, at a time when he iarches,
trusted to the union of all Peru in his favour, was of a Ipirit
more undaunted, and more accuflomed to the vicissitudes of
fortune, than to be disconcerted or appalled. As the danger
from Centeno's operations was the most urgent, he instantly
set out to oppose him. Having provided horses for all his bfl-
diers, he marched with amazing rapidity. But every morning
he found his force diminished by numbers who had left him
during the night; and though he became suspicious to excess,
and punished without mercy all whom he suspected, the rage
of desertion was too violent to be checked. Before he got
within fight of the enemy at Huarina, near the lake TFitica,
he could not muster more than four hundred soldiers. IBut these
he jufily confidered as men of tried attachment, on whom he
might depend. They were indeed the boldell and moll l delc-
rate of his followers, conscious like himself of crienes for
which they could hardly expect forgivcneis, and without any

the most obtfinate and bloody that had hitherto been fought in
and defeats Peru. At length the intrepid valour of Pizarro, and the fupe-

riority of Carvajal's military talents, triumphed over numbers,
and obtained a complete victory. The booty was immense ',
and the treatment of the vanquished cruel. By this signal
success the reputation of Piznrro was re-established, and being
now deemed invincible in the field, his army increased daily in
number k.

BUT events happened in other parts of Peru, which more

than counterbalanced the splendid victory at Huarina. Pizarro
lied scarcely left Lima, when the citizens, weary of his oppref-

detachment of soldiers from the fleet, took possession of the

settlement in the low country declared for the king. The fitua-
tion of the two parties was now perfealy reverted; Cuzco and
the adjacent provinces were possessed by Pizarro; all the reft of
the empire, from Quito southward, acknowledged the jurif-
diaion of Gafca. As his numbers augmented fast, Gafca ad-
vanced into the interior part of the country. His behaviour
ifll continued to be gentle and unassuming; he expresscd, on
every occasion, his ardent with of terminating thlc contell with-

Though desirous of peace, he did not flacken his preparations
for war. He appointed the general rendezvous of his troops
in the fertile valley of Xauxa, on the road to Cuzco m. There Advances to-
he remained for some months, not only that he might have time
to make another attempt towards an accommodation with Pi-
zarro, but that he might train his new soldiers to the life of
arms, and accustom them to the discipline of a camp, before he
led them against a body of victorious veterans. Pizarro, intoxi-
cated with the success which had hitherto accompanied his arms,
and elated with having again near a thousand men under his
command, refused to liften to any terms, although Cepeda, to-
gether with several of his officers, and even Carvajal himself",
gave it as their advice to close with the president's offer of a
general indemnity, and the revocation of the obnoxious laws .
Gafca having tried in vain every expedient to avoid imbruing
his hands in the blood of his countrymen, began to move to- Dec. z.,.

opulent country in America, every officer, and almost all the
private men were cloathed in fluffs of silk, or brocade, embroi-
dered with gold and silver; and their horses, their arms, their
standards, were adorned with all the pride of military pomp P.
That of Gafca, though not so splendid, exhibited what was no
less striking. He himself, accompanied by the archbishop of
Lima, the bishops of Quito and Cuzco, and a great number of
ecclesiastics, marching along the lines, blessing the men, and
encouraging them to a resolute discharge of their duty.

dent. Garcilaffo de la Vega, and other officers of note, fol-
lowed his example. The revolt of persons in such high rank
firuck all with amazement. The mutual confidence on which
the union and 1trength of armies depend, ceased at once. Dif-
trust and conflernation spread from rank to rank. Some silent-
ly flipped away, others threw down their arms, the greatefl
number went over to the royaliifs. Pizarro, Carvajal, and tome
leaders, employed authority, threats, and entreaties to flop
them, but in vain. In less than half an hour, a body of men,
which might have decided the fate of the Peruvian empire, was
totally dispersed. Pizarro, feeing all irretrievably loft, cried
out in amazement to a few officers who still faithfully adhered
to him, " What remains for us to do?" " Let us rush, re-

ness disgraceful to his former fame, he surrendered to one of L----
Gafca's officers. Carvajal, endeavouring to escape, was ovcr- taken,
taken and seized.

GASCA, happy in this bloodless vicory, did not stain it wvitl and put to

cruelty. Pizarro, Carvajal, and a small number of the more
diflinguiflcd or notorious offenders, were punished capitally.
Pizarro was beheaded on the day after he surrendered. He sub-
mitted to his fate with a composed dignity, and seemed defi-
rous to atone by repentance for the crimes which he had com-
mitted. The end of Carvajal was suitable to his life. On his
trial he offered no defence. When the sentence adjudging him
to be hanged was pronounced, he carelessly replied, " One can
die but once." During the interval between the sentence and
execution, lie discovered no fgn either of remorse for the pail, or
of solicitude about the future; fcofling at all who visited him,
in his usual sarcastic vein of mirth, with the fame quickness of
repartee and gross pleasantry as at any other period of his life.
Cepeda, more criminal than either, ought to have shared the
fame fate; but tlhe merit of having deserted his afrociates at
such a critical moment, and with such decisive effect, saved
him from immediate punifihmcnt. Iie was lent, however, as

striking, and which indicate such an uncommon fiate of man-
ners, as to merit particular attention.

TIOUGH the Spaniards who first invaded Peru were of the

lowest order in society, and the greater part of those who after-
wards joined them were persons of desperate fortune, yet in all
the bodies of troops brought into the field by the different
leaders who contended for superiority, not one man aded as a
hired soldier, that follows his standard for pay. Every adven-
turer in Peru confidered himself as a conqueror, entitled, by
his services, to an eflablifhment in that country which had been
acquired by his valour. In the contests between the rival chiefs,
each chose his fide as he was direaed by his own judgment or
affeCtions. He joined his commander as a companion of his
fortune, and disdained to degrade himself by receiving the wages
of a mercenary. It was to their sword, not to pre-eminence in
office, or nobility of birth, that most of the leaders whom they
followed were indebted for their elevation; and each of their
adherents hoped, by the fame means, to open a way for him-
self to the possession of power and wealth '.

B u T though the troops in Peru served without any regular pay,

they were railed at immense expence. Among men accustomed
to divide the spoils of an opulent country, the defirc of obtaining
wealth acquired incredible force. The ardour of pursuit aug-
mented in proportion to the hope of success. WWhcrc all were
intent on the fame objec, and under the dominion of the fame
paflion, there was but one mode of gaining men, or of fecur-
ing their attachment. Officers of name and influence, becides

by his early defection from Pizarro, and surrender of the fleet
to Gafca, decided the fate of Peru, obtained a difirid of country
affording two hundred thousand pesos of yearly value '. While
such rewards were dealt out to the principal officers, with more
than royal munificence, proportional ihares were conferred upon
those of inferior rank.

rewards, they never failed, on the day of battle, to display all
their ancient valour.

Ferocity with TOGETHER with their courage, they retained all the fero-
which th.eir
contels were city by which they were originally distinguished. Civil discord
carrid on, never raged with a more fell spirit than among the Spaniards

in Peru. To all the passions which usually envenom con-
tests among countrymen, avarice was added, and rendered their
enmity more rancorous. Eagerness to seize the valuable forfei-
tures expected upon the death of every opponent, shut the door
against mercy. To be wealthy, was of itself sufficient to expose
a man to accusation, or to subjea him to punishment. On the
slightest suspicions, Pizarro condemned many of the most opu-
lent inhabitants in Peru to death. Carvajal, without searching
for any pretext to justify his cruelty, cut of many more. The
number of those who suffered by the hand of the executioner,
was not much inferior to what fell in the field ; and the
greater part was condemned without the formality of any
legal trial.

united, and violate the engagements under which he had come.
The viceroy Nugnez Vela was ruined by the treachery of
Cepeda and the other judges of the royal audience, who were
bound by the duties of their function to have supported his au-
thority. The chief advisers and companions of Gonzalo Pizar-
ro's revolt, were the first to forsake him, and submit to his ene-
mies. His fleet was given up to Gafca, by the man whom he
had singled out among his officers to entrust with that important
command. On the day that was to decide his fate, an army
of veterans, in fight of the enemy, threw down their arms
without firiking a blow, and deserted a leader who had often
conduced them to vicory. Instances of such general and
avowed contempt of the principles and obligations which attach
man to man, and bind them together in social union, rarely oc-
cur in history. It is only where men are far removed from the
feat of government, where the refiraints of law and order are
little felt, where the profpet of gain is unbounded, and im-
mense wealth may cover the crimes by which it is acquired,
that wc can find any parallel to the levity, the rapaciousness,

of these was in some measure accomplished, by appointing Pe-
dro de Valdivia to prosecute the conquest of Chili; and by em-
powering Diego Centeno to undertake the discovery of the vast
regions bordering on the river De la Plata. The reputation of
those leaders, and the hopes of better fortune in a new country,
alluring many of the most indigent and desperate soldiers to fol-
low their standards, drained off no inconsiderable portion of that
mutinous inflammable spirit which Gafca dreaded.

Gafca, when now absolute master of this immense property,
retained the fame disinterested sentiments which he had origi-
nally professed, and refused to reserve the smallest portion of it
for himself. But the number of claimants was great; and
whilst the vanity or avarice of every individual fixed the value
of his own services, and estimated the recompence which he
thought due to him, the pretensions of each were so extrava-
gant, that it was impoflible to satisfy all. Gafca liflened to
them one by one, with the most patient attention, and
that he might have leisure to weigh the comparative merit
of their several claims with accuracy, he retired, with the

leagues from Cuzco. There he spent several days in allotting '---- '
to each a diftric of lands and number of Indians, in pro-
portion to his idea of their past services, and future importance.
But that he might get beyond the reach of the fierce storm of
clamour and rage, which he foresaw would burst out on the
publication of his decree, notwithstanding the impartial equity
with which he had framed it, he set out for Lima, Icaving the
intfrument of partition fealed up, with orders not to open it for
some days after his departure.

to its violence. It broke out with all the fury of military info-
lence. Calumny, threats, and curses were poured out openly
upon the president. He was accused of ingratitude, of par-
tiality, and of injuufice. Among soldiers prompt to aCtion, such
fcditious discourse would have been soon followed by deeds no
less violent, and they already began to turn their eyes towards
some difcontcnted leaders, expeCting them to stand forth in re-
dress of their wrongs. 1By some vigorous intcrpofitions of go-
vernment, a timely check was given to this mutinous spirit, and
the danger of another civil war was averted for the prcfent ".

in place of anarchy and usurpation, he eftablifled the govern-
ment of laws, and the authority of the rightful sovereign. But
the praise beflowed on his abilities was exceeded by that which
his virtue merited. After residing in a country where wealth
presented allurements which had seduced every person who had
hitherto poffefled power there, he returned from that trying
flation with integrity not only untainted but unfufpetedd. After
diflributing among his countrymen possessions of greater extent
and value than had ever been in the disposal of a subjed in any
age or nation, he himself remained in his original state of po-
verty; and at the very time, when he brought such a large recruit
to the royal treasury, he was obliged to apply by petition for a
finall fum to discharge some petty debts which he had con-
traded during the course of his service d. Charles was not in-
sensible to such disinterested merit. Gafca was received by him
with the molt diflinguifhing marks of efleem, and being pro-

men, than by general or public motives, the detail of them is

every thing of extreme violence either in the natural or political

nations of the cient continent, the inferiority of America in improvement will
atncent con- be conspicuous, and neither the Mexicans nor Peruvians will

be entitled to rank with those nations which merit the name of
civilized. The people of both the great empires in America,
like the rude tribes around them, were totally unacquainted
with the useful metals, and the progress which they had made
in extending their dominion over the animal creation was in-
considerable. The Mexicans had gone no farther than to tame
and rear turkeys, ducks, a species of small dogs, and rabbits bo
By this feeble essay of ingenuity, the means of subsistence were
rendered somewhat more plentiful and secure, than when men
depend solely on hunting; but they had no idea of attempting
to subdue the more robust animals, or of deriving any aid from
their minifiry in carrying on works of labour. The Peruvians
seem to have negleted the inferior animals, and had not ren-
dered any of them domeflic except the duck; but they were
more fortunate in taming the Llama, an animal peculiar to
their country, of a form which bears some resemblance to a
deer, and some to a camel, and of a size somewhat larger than
a sheep. Under the protetion of man, this species multiplied
greatly. Its wool furnifled the Peruvians with clothing, its

flesh with food. It was even employed as a beast of burden, B 0 o K
and carried a moderate load with much patience and docility . .-_
It was never used for draught; and the breed being confined to
the mountainous country, its service, if we may judge by in-
cidents that occur in the early Spanish writers, was not very
extensive among the Peruvians in their original state.

IN tracing the line by which nations proceed towards civili-

zation, the discovery of the useful metals, and the acquisition
of dominion over the animal creation, have been marked as
fleps of capital importance in their progress. In our continent,
long after men had attained both, society continued in that state
which is denominated barbarous. Even with all that command
over nature which these confer, many ages elapse, before in-
duftry becomes so perfect as to render subsistence secure, before
the arts that supply the wants and furnish the accommodations
of life are invented, and before any idea is conceived of the
various institutions requisite in a well-ordered society. The
Mexicans and Peruvians, without knowledge of the useful
metals, or the aid of domestic animals, laboured under difadvan-
tages which must have greatly retarded their progress, and in
their highest state of improvement, their power was so limited,
and their operations so feeble, that they can hardly be confi-
dered as having advanced beyond the infancy of civil life.

ed concerning the defective and inaccurate information on
which we must rely with respect to the condition and customs
of the savage tribes in America, may be applied likewise to our
knowledge of the Mexican empire. Cortes, and the rapacious
adventurers who accompanied him, had not leisure or capacity
to enrich either civil or natural history with new observations.
They.undertook their expedition in quelf of one object, and
seem hardly to have turned their eyes towards any other. Or,
if during some short interval of tranquillity, when the occupa-
tions of war ceased, and the ardour of plunder was suspended,
the inflitutions and manners of the people whom they had in-
vaded drew their attention, the inquiries of illiterate soldiers
were conduaed with so little sagacity and precision, that the
accounts given by them of the policy and order eflablifhed in
the Mexican monarchy are superficial, confused, and inexpli-
cable. It is rather from incidents which they relate occasion-
ally, than from their own dcduaions and remarks, that we are
enabled to form tome idea of the genius and manners of that
people. The obscurity in which the ignorance of its con-
querors involved the annals of Mexico, was augmented by the
fupcrflition of those who fucccedcd tlicm. As the memory of
pall events was preservcd among the Mexicans by figures

painted on skins, on cotton cloth, or on the bark of trees, the B o o K
early missionaries, unable to comprehend their meaning, and - -
struck with their uncouth forms, conceived them to be monu-
ments of idolatry which ought to be destroyed, in order to fa-
cilitate the conversion of the Indians. In obedience to an edict
issued byJuan deZummaraga, a Franciscan monk, the firt bishop
of Mexico, all those records of the ancient Mexican story which
could be collctecd were committed to the flames. In consequence
of this fanatical zeal of the monks who first visited New Spain,
and which their successors soon began to lament, whatever
knowledge of remote events such rude monuments contained was
entirely loft, and no information remained concerning the an-
cient revolutions and policy of the empire, but what was de-
rived from tradition, or from some fragments of their historical
paintings tlat escaped the barbarous researches of Zummaraga d.
From the experience of all nations it is manifest, that the me-
mory of pals tranfations can neither be long preserved, nor be
tranfinitted with any fidelity by tradition. The Mexican paint-
ings which are ftppofed to have servcd as annals of their em-
pire, are few in nurnber, and of ambiguous meaning. Thus

latter, vwe mnuf glean what intelligenc can be colledSed i-romn

name of New Spain. These, more civilized than the original
inhabitants, began to form them to the arts of social life. At
length, towards the commencement of the thirteenth century,
the Mexicans, a people more polished than any of the former,
advanced from the border of the Californian gulf, and took
possession of the plains adjacent to a great lake near the centre
of the country. After residing there about fifty years, they
founded a town, since distinguished by the name of Mexico,
which from humble beginnings soon grew to be the most con-
fiderable city in the New World. The Mexicans, long after
they were established in their new possessions, continued, like
other martial tribes in America, unacquainted with regal do-
minion, and were governed in peace and conduted in war by
such as were entitled to pre eminence by their wisdom or their
valour. But among them, as in other flates whose power and
territories become extensive, the supreme authority centred at
last in a tingle person ; and when the Spaniards under Cortes
invaded the country, Montezuma was the ninth monarch in
order who had swayed the Mexican sceptre, not by hereditary
right, but by elecion.
Very recent. SUCi is the traditional tale of the Mexicans concerning the

progress of their own empire. According to this, its duration
was very Ihort. I;rom the irfi migration of their parent tribe,
they can reckon little more than three hundred years. From the
clablilhmcnt of monarchical government, not above a hundred

have been of higher antiquity, and to have subsisted during B °0o K
such a length of time as the Spanish accounts of its civilization -
would naturally lead us to conclude, it is difficult to conceive
how, among a people who poiTeffed the art of recording events
by piaulres, and who confidered it as an essential part of
their national education, to teach their children to repeat the
historical songs which celebrated the exploits of their ancef-
tors , the knowledge of pall transaCtions ihould be so ilender
and limited. If, on the other hand, we adopt their own fyfcem
with refpec to the antiquities of their nation, it is no less dif-
ficult to account either for that improved state of society, or for
the extensive dominion to which their empire had attained,
when first visited by the Spaniards. The infancy of nations is
so long, and, even when every circumfiance is favourable to
their progress, they advance so slowly towards any maturity of
strength or policy, that the recent origin of the Mexicans seems
to be a strong presumption of some exaggeration, in the fplen-
did descriptions which have been given of their government and
manners.

and others which seem to indicate that it had advanced but

The right of
property fully we have seen, that the idea of a title to the separate and
eflabliied. exclusive possession of any object was hardly known; and

that among all, it was extremely limited and ill-defined. But
in Mexico, where agriculture and industry had made some
progress, the diitinction between real and moveable possei-
sions, between property in land and property in goods, had
taken place. Both might be transferred from one person
to another by sale or barter; both might descend by inhe-
ritance. Every person who could be denominated a free man
had property in land. This, however, they held by various
tenures. Some possessed it in full right, and it descended to
their heirs. The title of others to their lands was derived from
the office or dignity which they enjoyed ; and when deprived of
the latter, they loft possession of the former. Both these modes
of occupying land were deemed noble, and peculiar to citizens
of the highest class. The tenure, by which the great body of
the people held their property, was very different. In every
diftrid a certain quantity of land was measured out, in propor-
tion to the number of families. This was cultivated by the
joint labour of the whole; its produce was deposited in a com-
mon florcloufe, and divided among them according to their
refpcEtive exigencies. The members of the (Ca/pnllec, or afro-
ciations, could not alienate their flare of the common ciatc;
it was an indivisible permanent property, dcftined for the fiqp-
port of their families . In consequence of this ditribution of
the territory of the slate, every man had an intercll in its wel-
fare, and the happiness of the individual was conneced with
the public security.

ONE of the most firiking circumRfances, which diftinguifles B o o K
the Mexican empire from those nations in America we have ----

The number

already described, is the number and greatness of its cities. an.d ecatnefs
While society continues in a rude slate, the wants of men are ot thrcircitcs
so few, and they sand so little in need of mutual afliftance,
that their inducements to crowd together are extremely feeble.
Their industry at the fame time is so imperfect, that it can-
not secure subsistence for any considerable number of fami-
lies fettled in one spot. They live dispersed, at this period,
from choice as well as from necessity, or at the utmost afTemble
in small hamlets on the banks of the river which supplics them
with food, or on the border of some plain left open by nature,
or cleared by their own labour. The Spaniards, accustomed
to this mode of habitation among all the savage tribes with
which they were then acquainted, were aftonilhed, on entering
New Spain, to find the natives residing in towns of such extent
as resembled those of Europe. In the first fcrvour of their ad-
miration, they compared Zcmpoalla, though a town only of
the second or third size, to the cities of grcatefi note in their
own country. WVhen, afterwards, they visited in fucceflion
Tlafcala, Cholula, Tacuba, Tezcuco, and Mexico itself; their
amazement increased lo much, that it led them to convey ideas
of their magnitude and populoulncis bordering on what is in-
credible. Even when there is lcifure for ol)fcrvation, and no
interest tlat leads to deceive, conjeclural cflimatcs of the num-
ber of people in cities are extremely lootc, and usually much
exaggerated. It is not surprising, then, that Cortes and his
companions, little accunlonced to fiuch computations, and power-
fully tempted to magnify, in order to exalt the merit of their
own discoverics and coinqrlCef, ihould have been betrayed into
this common error, and hIave raised their descriptions confi-

N n 2 derably

B oI K derably above truth. For this reason, some considerable abate-

VIi.
.--v--' ement ought to be made from their calculation of the number

of inhabitants in the Mexican cities, and we may fix the flan-
dard of their population much lower than they have done; but
still they will appear to be cities of such consequence, as are not
to be found but among people who have made some considerable
progress in the arts of social life g.

The fepara- THE separation of profeflions among the Mexicans is a
tion of pro-
sessions, symptom of improvement no less remarkable. Arts, in the

early ages of society, are so few and so simple, that each man
is sufficiently master of them all, to gratify every demand of
his own limited desires. The savage can form his bow,,point
his arrows, rear his hut, and hollow his canoe, without call-
ing in the aid of any hand more skilful than his own. Time
must have augmented the wants of men, and ripened their in-
genuity, before the productions of art became so complicated
in their ftrucure, or so curious in their fabric, that a particular
course of education was requisite towards forming the artificer to
expertness in contrivance and workmanship. In proportion as
refinement spreads, the ditlinCtion of professions increases, and
they branch out into more numerous and minute subdivisions.
Among the Mexicans, this reparation of the arts neceflary in
life had taken place to a considerable extent. The functions
of the manfn, the weaver, the goldlfiith, the painter, and of
several other crafts, were carried on by dilHercnit persons. Each
was regularly inflrudted in his calling. To it alone his industry
was confined; and by assiduous application to one object, to-
gether with the persevering patience peculiar to Americans,
their artizans attained to a degree of neatness and perfction in

tools which they employed. Their various producions were t-__
brought into commerce; and by the exchange of them in the
stated markets held in the cities, their mutual wants were sup-
plied h, in such orderly intercourse as charaterizes an improved
state of society.

THE diftincion of ranks established in the Mexican empire The dinlir,c-

is the next circumfiance that merits attention. In surveying tion of rankt.
the savage tribes of America, we observed, that consciousness
of equality, and impatience of subordination, are sentiments
natural to man in the infancy of civil life. During peace, the
authority of a superior is hardly felt among them, and even in
war it is but little acknowledged. Strangers to the idea of pro-
perty, the difference in condition resulting from the inequality of
it is unknown. Birth or titles confer no pre-eminence; it is
only by personal merit and accomplishments that distinction can
be acquired. The form of society was very different among the
IlMexicans. The great body of the people was in a most humi-
liating state. A considerable number, known by the name of
Mayeques, nearly resembling in condition those peasants who,.
under various denominations, were confidered, during the pre-
valence of the feudal system, as instruments of labour attached to
the foil. The Alaycqucs could not change their place of residence
without permitlion of the fiperior on whom they depended. They
were conveyed, together with the lands on which they were
fettled, from one proprietor to another; and were bound to culti-
vate the ground, and to perform fevcral kinds of servile work'.

slate. Their condition was held to be so vile, and their lives
deemed to be of so little value, that a person who killed one of
those slaves was not fubjeaed to any punifliment k. Even those
confidered as freemen were treated by their haughty lords as be-
ings of an inferior species. The nobles, possessed of ample terri-
tories, were divided into various classes, to each of which peculiar
titles of honour belonged. Some of these titles, like their lands,
descended from father to son in perpetual succession. Others were
annexed to particular offices, or conferred during life as marks
of personal distinCtion'. The monarch, exalted above all, en-
joyed extensive power, and supreme dignity. Thus the dif-
tincion of ranks was completely eftablimhed, in a line of re-
gular subordination, reaching from the highest to the lowefl
member of the community. Each of there knew what he could
claim, and what he owed. The people, who were not allowed
to wear a dress of the fame fashion, or to dwell in houses of a
form similar to those of the nobles, accofled them with the mofl
submissive reverence. In the prefencc of their fovcreign, they
durst not lift their eyes from the ground, or look him in the
face ". The nobles themselves, when admitted to an audience
of their iovcreign, entered barc-footed, in mean garments,
and, as his slaves, paid him homage approaching to adoratioin.
This refplct due from inferiors to tholse above them in rank,
was eflablifled with such ceremonious accuracy, that it incor-
porated with the language, and. inilut'nccd its genius and
idiom. The lMexican tongue abounded in cxprcflions of re-

intercourse between equals, would have been so unbecoming B o o IK
in the mouth of one in a lower sphere, when he accosted a
person in higher rank, as to be deemed an insult ". It is only
in societies, which time and the inflitution of regular govern-
ment have moulded into form, that we find such an orderly
arrangement of men into different ranks, and such nice atten-
tion paid to their various rights.

THE spirit of the Mexicans, thus familiarized and bended Their polii-

government. But the descriptions of their policy and laws, by
the Spaniards who overturned them, are so inaccurate and
contradictory, that it is difficult to delineate the form of their
constitution with any precision. Sometimes they represent
the monarchs of Mexico as abfolutc, deciding according to
their pleasure, with refped to every operation of the Itate.
On other occasions, we discover the traces of established cuf-
toms and laws, framed in order to circumscribe the power
of the crown, and we meet with rights and privileges of the
nobles which seem to be opposed as barriers against its encroach-
ments. This appearance of inconfiflency has arisen from in-
attention to the innovations of Montczuma upon the Mexican
policy. His aspiring ambition ifubvcrtcd the original fyflcm of

and hope of recovering their rights, many of them courted the

s oo 0 proteaion of Cortes, and joined a foreign power against their

- dometic oppressor P. It is not then under the reign of Monte-

zuma, but under those of his predecessors, that we can disco-
ver what was the original form and genius of Mexican policy.
From the foundation of the monarchy to the election of Mon-
tezuma, it seems to have subsisted with little variation. That
body of citizens, which may be distinguished by the name of
nobility, formed the chief and molt refpeaable order in the
fIate. They were of various ranks, as has already been ob-
served, and their honours were acquired and transmitted in dif-
ferent manners. Their number seems to have been great. Ac-
cording to an author accustomed to examine with attention
what he relates, there were in the Mexican empire thirty of
this order, each of whom had in his territories about a hun-
dred thousand people, and subordinate to these, there were
about three thousand nobles of a lower class q. The territories
belonging to the chiefs of Tezeuco and Tacuba, were hardly
inferior in extent to those of the Mexican monarch '. Each of
these possessed complete territorial jurifdition, and levied taxes
from their own vassals. But all followed the ltandard of
Mexico in war, serving with a number of men in proportion
to their domain, and most of them paid tribute to its monarch
as their superior lord.

IN tracing those great lines of the Mexican constitution, an

image of feudal policy in its most rigid form"riies to view,

pressed into the lowest tfate of fubjedion, and a king entrusted B 0 K.
with the executive power of the state. Its spirit and principles _-
seem to have operated in the New World in the fame manner,
as in the ancient. The jurifdidtion of the crown was extremely
limited. All real and effective authority was retained by the
Mexican nobles in their own hands, and the shadow of it
only left to the king. Jealous to excess of their own rights,
they guarded with most vigilant anxiety against the encroach-
ments of their sovereigns. By a fundamental law of the em-
pire, it was provided that the king flould not determine con-
cerning any point of general importance, without the appro-
bation of a council composed of the prime nobility'. Unless
he obtained their consent he could not engage the nation in
war, nor could he dispose of the mofd considerable branch of the
public revenue at pleasure, it was appropriated to certain pur-
poses from which it could not be diverted by the regal autho-
rity '. In order to secure full effed to those conflitutional re-
firaints, the Mexican nobles did not permit their crown to
descend by inheritance, but disposed of it by election. The
right of election seems to have been originally vested in the
whole body of nobility, but was afterwards committed to fix
electors, of whom the Chiefs of Tezeuco and Tacuba were
always two. From refpea for the family of their monarchs,
the choice fell generally upon tome person spr-ung from it.
But as the acivity and valour of their prince were of greater
moment to a people perpetually engaged in war, than a flrin
adherence to the order of birth, collaterals of mature age or
di(linguiflhed merit were often preferred to those who were

had attained when Cortes landed in New Spain.

Power and WHILE the jurifdition of the Mexican monarchs continued

splendour of their government augmented. It was in this last
slate that the Spaniards beheld it, and struck with the appear-
ance of Montezuma's court, they describe its pomp at great
length, and with much admiration. The number of his at-
tendants, the order, the silence, and the reverence with which
they served him; the vast extent of his royal mansion, the
variety of its apartments allotted to different officers, and the
ostentation with which his grandeur was displayed, whenever
he permitted his fubjeas to behold him, seem to resemble the
magnificence of the ancient monarchies in Asia, rather than the
simplicity of the infant fRates in the New World.

money was unknown, all the taxes were paid in kind, and thus
not only the natural productions of all the different provinces
in the empire, but every species of manufacture, and every
work of ingenuity and art were collected in the public tfore-
houses. From those the emperor supplied his numerous train
of attendants in peace, and his armies during war, with food,
with cloaths, and ornaments. People of inferior condition,
neither possessing land nor engaged in commerce, were bound

<t * - already mentioned, of public couriers, fiationed at proper inter-

vals, to convey intelligence from one part of the empire to the
other, was a refinement in police not introduced into any king-
dom of Europe at that period. The ftruture of the capital
city in a lake, with artificial dykes, and causeways of great
length, which served as avenues to it from different quarters,
ere&ed in the water with no less ingenuity than labour, seems
to be an idea that could not have occurred to any but a civilized
people. The fame observation may be applied to the ftruture
of the aqueducs, or conduits, by which they conveyed a stream
of fresh water, from a considerable distance, into the city,
along one of the causeways ". The appointment of a number

as the most decisive proof of their superior refinement. Cortes,
and the early Spanish authors, describe this with rapture, and
maintain, that the most celebrated European artists could not
surpass or even equal them in ingenuity and neatness of work-
manship. They represented men, animals, and other objects,
by such a disposition of various coloured feathers, as is said to
have produced all the effects of light and shade, and to have
imitated nature with truth and delicacy. Their ornaments of
gold and silver have been describcd to be of a fabric no less
curious. But in forming any idea, from general defcrip-

tions, concerning the state of arts among nations imperfecly B 0 ) K
polished, we are extremely ready to err. In examining the -
works of people whose advances in improvement are nearly the
fame with our own, we view them with a critical, and often
with a jealous eye. Whereas, when conscious of our own fu-
periority, we survey the arts of nations comparatively rude,
we are astonished at works executed by them under such ma-
nifeft disadvantages, and in the warmth of our admiration,
are apt to represent them as productions more finished than
they really are. To the influence of this illusion, without
supposing any intention to deceive, we may impute the exagge-
ration of some Spanish authors, in their accounts of the Mex-
ican arts.

IT is not from those descriptions, but from confidering such

specimens of their arts as are fill preserved, that we must de-
cide concerning their degree of merit. As the ship in which
Cortes sent to Charles V. the most curious productions of the
Mexican artisans, which were colleted by the Spaniards when
they first pillaged the empire, was taken by a French corsair %,
the remains of their ingenuity are less numerous than thole of
the Peruvians. Whether any of their works with feathers, in
imitation of painting, be frill extant in Spain, I have not
learned; but many of their ornaments in gold and lilver, as
well as various utensils employed in common life, are depolited
in the magnificent cabinet of natural and artificial produtions,
lately opened by the king of Spain; and I am informed by
pcrfons on whose judgment and taste I can rely, that these boafl-
ed efforts of their art are uncouth rcprcfentations of common
objects, or very coarIc images of the human and fomc other

copper-plates of their paintings, which have been published by
various authors. In them every figure of men, of quadrupeds,
or birds, as well as every representation of inanimated nature,
is extremely rude and aukward. The hardest Egyptian Rfile,
stiff and imperfet as it was, is more elegant. The scrawls of
children delineate objeds almost as accurately.

BUT however low the Mexican paintings may be ranked,

when viewed merely as works of art, a very different station
belongs to them, when confidered as the records of their coun-
try, as hitforical monuments of its policy and transaCtions;
and they become curious as well as interesting objects of atten-
tioin. The noblest and most beneficial invention of which hu-
man ingenuity can boast, is that of writing. But the first essays
of this art, which hath contributed more than all others to the
improvement of the species, were very rude, and it advanced
towards perfcaion slowly, and by a gradual progression. When
the warrior, eager for fame, wished to transmit some knowledge
of his exploits to succeeding ages; when the gratitude of a peo-
ple to their sovereign prompted them to hand down an account of
his beneficent deeds to poflerity; the first method of accomplish-
ing this, that seems to have occurred to them, was to delineate,
in the becf manner they could, figures representing the action of
which they were solicitous to preserve the memoy. Of this,
which has very properly been called pihzrre-writiig b, we find
traces among tome of the most savage tribes of America. When

the enemy whom he attacked, the scalps and captives which
he brought home. To those firnple annals he trusts for renown,

ceive praise from the warriors of future times'.

COMPARED with those aukward essays of their savage coun-

trymen, the paintings of the Mexicans may be confidered as
works of composition and design. They were not acquainted,
it is true, with any other method of recording tranfations,
than that of delineating the objects which they wished to re-
present. But they could exhibit a more complex series of events
in progressive order, and describe, by a proper disposition of
figures, the occurrences of a king's reign from his accession to
his death; the progress of an infant's education from its birth
until it attained to the years of maturity; the different recom-
pences and marks of diftinCdion conferred upon warriors, in
proportion to the exploits which they had performed. Some
singular specimens of this piture-writing have been preserved,
which are justly confidered as the most curious monuments of
art brought from the New World. The most valuable of there
was published by Purchas in fixty-fix plates. It is divided
into three parts. The first contains the history of the Mexican
empire under its ten monarchs. The second is a tribute-roll,
representing what each conquered town paid into the royal
treasury. The third is a code of their inflitutions, domeflic,
political, and military. Another fpccimen of Mexican paint-
ing has been published in thirty-two plates, by the present

---t tion of what the figures were intended to represent, which

was obtained by the Spaniards from Indians well acquainted
with their own arts. The style of painting in all these is the
fame. They represent things, not words. They exhibit images
to the eye, not ideas to the understanding. They may, there-
fore, be confidered as the earlieit and most imperfect eflay of
men in their progress towards discovering the art of writing.
The defects in this mode of recording tranfadions must have
been early felt. To paint every occurrence was, from its na-
ture, a very tedious operation; and as affairs became more
complicated, and events multiplied in any society, its annals
must have swelled to an enormous bulk. Besides this, no ob-
je61s could be delineated but those of sense; the conceptions of
the mind had no corporeal form, and as long as pidture-writ-
ing could not convey an idea of there, it must have been a
very imperfect art. The necessity of improving it mult have
rouzed and (harpened invention, and the human mind holding
the fame course in the New World as in the Old, might have
advanced by the fame successive iteps, firit, from an actual
picture to the plain hieroglyphic; next, to the allegorical sym-
bol; then to the arbitrary character; until, at length, an al-
phabet of letters was discovered, capable of exprefling all the
various combinations of found employed in speech. In the
paintings of the Mexicans we, accordingly, perceive, that this
progress was begun among them. Upon an attentive infpec-
tion of the plates, which I have mentioned, we may observe
some approach to the plain or simple hieroglyphic, where some
principal part or circumfiance in the subjec is made to fland
for the whole. In the annals of their kings, published by
Purchas, the towns conquered by each arc uniformly repre-

but in order to point out the particular towns which submitted --
to their victorious arms, peculiar emblems, Sometimes natural
objects, and sometimes artificial figures, are employed. In the
tribute-roll, published by the archbishop of Toledo, the house,
which was properly the picture of the town, is omitted, and the
emblem alone is employed to represent it. The Mexicans seem
even to have made some advances beyond this, towards the tfe
of the more figurative and fanciful hieroglyphic. In order to
describe a monarch, who had enlarged his dominions by force
of arms, they painted a target ornamented witl darts, and
placed it between him and those towns which he subdued. But
it is only in one instance, the notation of numbers, that we
discern any attempt to exhibit ideas which had no corporeal form.
The Mexican painters had invented artificial marks, or fJgns
of convention, for this purpose. By means of there, they com-
puted the years of their kings reigns, as well as the amount
of tribute to be paid into the royal treasury. The figure of a
circle represented unit, and in finall numbers, the computa-
tion was made by repeating it. Larger numbers were ex-
prcilcd by a peculiar mark, and they had such as denoted all
integral numbers from twenty to eight tloufand. The short
duration of their empire prevented the Mexicans from advan-
cing farther in that long course which conducts men fiom the
llbour of delineating real objels, to the simplicity and ease of
alplhaletic writing. Their records, notwithflanding some dawn
of such ideas as might have led to a more perfeCt flylc, can be
conlitlered as nothing more than a fpecics of picti re-writing, so

vided their year into eighteen months, each confifling of twenty
days, amounting in all to three hundred and sixty. But as they
observed that the course of the fun was not completed in that
time, they added five days to the year. These, which were
properly intercalary days, they termedJihpernunterary or wqaJ/e;
and as they did not belong to any month, no work was done,
and no sacred rite performed on them; they were devoted
wholly to festivity and pallimet. This near approach to phi-
lofophical accuracy is a remarkable proof that the Mexicans
had bestowed some attention upon inquiries and speculations,
to which men in a very rude state never turn their thoughts.

not differ greatly from those of the other inhabitants of Ame-

to hostility seem to have been the fame. They fought, in order

and it was by the number of these that they estimated the glory -
of victory. No captive was ever ransomed or spared. All
were sacrificed without mercy, and their flesh devoured with
the fame barbarous joy as among the fiercest savages. On some
occasions it rose to even wilder excefles. Their principal
warriors covered themselves with the skins of the unhappy
victims, and danced about the fireets, boasting of their own
valour, and exulting over their enemies f. Even in their civil
institutions we discover traces of that barbarous disposition
which their system of war inspired. The four chief counsellors
of the empire were distinguished by atrocious titles, which
could have been afleumed only by a people who delighted in
blood'. This ferocity of characer prevailed among all the na-
tions of New Spain. The Tlafcalans, the people of Mechoacan,
and other states at enmity with the Mexicans, delighted equally
in war, and treated their prisoners with the fame cruelty. In
proportion as mankind combine in social union, and live under
the influence of equal laws and regular policy, their manners
soften, sentiments of humanity arise, and the rights of the fpe-
cies come to be understood. The fierceness of war abates, and
even while engaged in hostility, men remember what they owe
one to another. The savage fights to destroy, the citizen to
conquer. The former neither pities nor spares, the latter has
acquired sensibility which tempers his rage. To this sensibility
the Mexicans seem to have been perfel firangers, and among
them war was carried on with so much of its original barbarity,
that we cannot but fufpea their degree of civilization to have
lcenl very impcrfcet.

those fats in the hiflory of the New World which seems to
have been admitted without due examination or sufficient evi-
dence. The Spanish historians, in order to magnify the valour
of their countrymen, are accustomed to represent the dominion
of Montezuma as firetching over all the provinces of New
Spain from the North to the Southern Ocean. But a great part
of the mountainous country was possessed by the Otomies, a
fierce uncivilized people, who seem to have been the residue of
the original inhabitants. The provinces towards the north
and weft of Mexico were occupied by the Chic/hemecas, and
other tribes of hunters. None of these recognized the Mexi-
can monarch as their fiiperior. Even in the interior and more
level country, there were fcveral cities and provinces which had
never submitted to the Mexican yoke. T]afcala, though only
twenty-one leagues from the capital of the empire, was an in-
dependent and itoflilc republic. Cholula, though flill nearer,

for its implacable enmity to the Mexican name . By these
hoflile powers the Mexican empire was circumscribed on every
quarter, and the high ideas which we are apt to form of it from
the description of the Spanish historians, ihould be considerably
moderated.

Little inter- IN consequence of this independence of several fates in New
course among Spain upon the Mexican empire, there was not any considerable

country, not far distant from the capital, there seem to have
been no roads to facilitate the communication of one difirilt
with another; and when the Spaniards first attempted to pene-
trate into it, they had to open their way through forests and
marshes . Cortes, in his adventrous march from Mexico to
Honduras in 1525, met with obPfruations and endured hard-
ships little inferior to those with which he must have Struggled

could hardly force a paflage through impervious woods, and
plains overflowed with water. In others he found so little cul-
tivation, that his troops were frequently in danger of perishing
by famine. Such fads correspond ill with the pompous de-
scription which the Spanish writers give of Mexican police and
indunfry, and convey an idea of a country nearly similar to that
pofTcned by the Indian tribes in North America. Here and

appeared no sign of any established communication, few marks
of industry, and no monument of art.

A NO less firiking proof of this imperfecion in their com-

mercial intercourse is their want of money, or some universal
standard by which to estimate the value of commodities. The
discovery of this is among the steps of greatest consequence in
the progress of nations. Until it has been made, all their tranf-
acions must be io aukward, so operose, and so limited, that we
may boldly pronounce that they have advanced but a little way
in their career. The invention of such a commercial standard
is of such high antiquity in our hemisphere, and rifes so far
beyond the zra of authentic history, as to appear almost coeval
with the exiflence of society. The precious metals seem to have
been early employed for this purpose, and from their perma-
nent value, their divisibility, and many other qualities, they are
better adapted to fcrve as a common standard, than any other
substance of which Nature has given us the command. But in
the New World, where these metals abound most, this use of
them was not known. The exigencies of rude tribes, or of
monarchies imperfeclly civilized, did not call for it. All their
commercial intercourfc was carried on by barter, and their igno-
rance of any common standard by which to facilitate that ex-
change of commodities which contributes so much towards the
comfort of life, may be jultly mentioned as an evidence of the
infant state of their policy. But even in the New World the
inconvenience of wanting some general inftrumcnt of commerce
began to be felt, and some efforts were made towards supply-

B 0 o K ing that defect. The Mexicans, among whom the number and

vi--- greatne.s of their cities gave rife to a more extended commerce,

than in any part of America, had begun to employ a common
flandard of value, which rendered smaller tranfadions much
more easy. As chocolate was the favourite drink of persons in
every rank of life, the nuts or almonds of cacao, of which it is
composed, were of such universal consumption, that, in their
stated markets, these were willingly received in return for com-
modities of fiall price. Thus they came to be confidered as the
infirument of commerce, and the value of what one wished to
dispose of, was estimated by the number of nuts of the cacao,
which he might expect in exchange for it. This seems to be
the utmost length which the Americans had advanced towards
the discovery of any expedient for supplying the use of money.
And if the want of it is to be held, on one hand, as a proof of
their barbarity, this expedient for supplying that want, should
be admitted on the other, as an evidence no less satisfying, of
the superior progress which the Mexicans had made in refine-
ment and civilization.

Mexico, though, from the peculiarity of its situation, the difpo- B 0O K
fition of the houses was more orderly, the firuaure of the greater i
part was equally mean. Nor does the fabric of their temples and Temples,
other public edifices appear to have been such as entitled them
to the high praises bestowed upon them by many Spanish authors.
As far as one can gather from their obscure and inaccurate de-
scriptions, the great temple of Mexico, the moss famous in New
Spain, which has been represented as a magnificent building,
raised to such a height, that the ascent to it was by a stair-case
of a hundred and fourteen steps, was a solid mass of earth of a
square form faced partly with stone. Its base on each fide
extended ninety feet, and decreasing gradually as it advanced
in height, it terminated in a quadrangle of about thirty feet,
where were placed a .hrine of the deity and two altars on
which the victims were sacrificed q. All the other celebrated
temples of New Spain exaaly resembled that of Mexico r. Such
structures convey no high idea of progress in art and ingenuity;
and one can hardly conceive that a form more rude and simple
could have occurred to a nation, in its first efforts towards eret-
ing any great work.

GREATER skill and ingenuity were displayed, if we may an(dot.er

believe the Spanish historians, in the houses of the emperor and Jngc bul
in those of the principal nobility. There, some elegance of
design was visible, and a commodious arrangement of the apart-
ments was attended to. But if buildings corresponding to such
descriptions had ever existed in the Mexican cities, it is probable
that some remains of them would fill be visible. From the man-
ner in which Cortes conducted the siege of Mexico, we can indeed

B o°v K easily account for the total deftruaion of whatever had any ap-

,_-K-.- pearance of splendor in that capital. But as only two centuries

and a half have elapsed since the conquest of New Spain, it
seems altogether incredible that in a period so ihort, every vef-
tige of this boasted elegance and grandeur should have difap-
peared; and that in none of the other cities, particularly in
those which did not susser by the deftrutive hand of the con-
querors, there are any ruins, which can be confidered as monu-
ments of their ancient magnificence.

EVEN in a village of the rudest Indians there are buildings

of greater extent and elevation than common dwelling-houfes.
Those which are destined for holding the council of the tribe,
and in which all assemble on occasions of public festivity, may
be called fiately edifices, when compared with the reft. As
among the Mexicans the diftinaion of ranks was established,
and property was unequally divided, the number ofdiftinguifhed
ftru&ures in their towns would of course be greater than in
other parts of America. But these seem not to have been either
so solid or magnificent as to merit those pompous epithets which
some Spanish authors employ in describing them. It is pro-
bable that, though more ornamented, and built on a larger
scale, they were erected with the fame flight materials which
the Indians employed in their common buildings', and Time,
in a space much less than two hundred and fifty years, may
have swept away all remains of them '.

FROM this enumeration of facts, it seems, upon the whole, to
be evident that the fate of society in Mexico was considerably

advanced beyond that of the savage tribes which we have deline- B ov K
ated. But it is no less manifest, that with refpet to many par- ,J
ticulars, the Spanish accounts of their progress appear to be
highly embellished. There is not a more frequent or a more
fertile source of deception in describing the manners and arts of
savage nations, or of such as are imperfectly civilized, than that
of applying to them the names and phrases appropriated to the
institutions and refinements of polifled life. When the leader of
a small tribe, or the head of a rude community, is dignified with
the name of king or emperor, the place of his residence can re-
ceive no other name but that of his palace; and whatever his at-
tendants may be, they must be called his court. Under such
appellations they acquire an importance and dignity which does
not belong to them. The illusion spreads, and giving a false
colour to every part of the narrative, the imagination is so much
carried away with the resemblance, that it becomes difficult to
discern objeds as they really are. The Spaniards, when they
first touched on the Mexican coast, were so much struck with
the appearance of attainments in policy and in the arts of life,
far superior to those of the rude tribes with which they were
hitherto acquainted, that they fancied they had at length disco-
vered a civilized people in the New World. This comparison
between the people of Mexico and their uncultivated neighbours
they appear to have kept constantly in view, and observing with
admiration many things which marked the pre-eminence of the
former, they employ in describing their imperfec policy and
infant arts, such terms as are applicable to the institutions of
men far beyond them in improvement. Both there circum-
flances concur in detracting from the credit due to the defcrip-
tions of Mexican manners by the early Spanifi writers. By
drawing a parallel between them and those of people so much

_qq 2 less

399

B o0 K less civilized, they raised their own ideas too high. By their

VII. _-_---'. mode of describing them, they conveyed ideas to others no less

exalted above truth. Later writers have adopted the style of the
original historians, and improved upon it. The colours with
which De Solis delineates the characer of Montezuma, the
splendor of his court, the laws and policy of his empire, are
the fame that he mull have employed in exhibiting to view the
monarch and institutions of an highly polished people.

BUT though we may admit, that the warm imagination of

the Spanish writers has added Ibme embellishment to their de-
scriptions, this will not juflify the decisive and peremptory
tone, with which several authors pronounce all their accounts of
the Mexican power, policy and laws, to be the fiEtions of men
who wished to deceive, or who delighted in the marvellous.
There are few historical faas that can be ascertained by evi-
dence more unexceptionable, than may be produced in support
of the material articles, in the description of the Mexican con-
flitution and manners. Eye-witnesses relate what they had be-
held, men who had resided among the Mexicans both before
and after the conquest, describe institutions and customs which
were familiar to them, persons of such different professions that
objects must have presented themselves to their view under every
various aspea ; soldiers, priests, and lawyers, all concur in their
testimony. Had Cortes ventured to impose upon his sovereign,
by exhibiting to him a picure of imaginary "manners, there
wanted not enemies and rivals who were qualified to detct his
deceit, and who would have rejoiced in exposing it. But
according to the just remark of an author, whose inge-
nuity has illustrated and whose eloquence has adorned the his-
tory of America ", this fiuppofition is in itself as improbable, as

the attempt would have been audacious. Who among the de- B 0o JK

VII.

ftroyers of this great empire was so enlightened by science, or
so attentive to the progress and operations of men in social life,
as to frame a ficitious system of policy, so well combined and
so confitent, as that which they delineate, in their accounts of
the Mexican government ? Where could they have borrowed
the idea of many institutions in legislation and police, to which,
at that period, there was nothing parallel in the nations with
which they were acquainted ? There was not at the beginning
of the sixteenth century, a regular establishment of polls for
conveying intelligence, to the sovereign of any kingdom in
Europe. The fame observation will apply to what the Spaniards
relate, with refpedt to the ftruture of the city of Mexico, the
regulations concerning its police, and various laws established for
the adminiitration of justice, or securing the happiness of the
community. Whoever is accustomed to contemplate the progress
of nations, will often, at very early fiages of it, discover a pre-
mature and unexpected dawn of those ideas, which give rife to
inflitutions, that are the pride and ornament of its most advanced
period. Even in a state as imperfectly polished as the Mexican
empire, the happy genius of some sagacious observer, excited or
aided by circumstances unknown to us, may have introduced in-
ftitutions which are seldom found but in societies highly refined.
But it is almost impossible that the illiterate conquerors of the
New World should have formed in any one instance a conception
of cufloms and laws, beyond the standard of improvement in their
own age and country. Or if Cortes and his followers had been
capable of this, what inducement had those by whom they were
fuiperfeded to continue the deception? Why should Corita, or

Religion of IN one particular, however, the guides whom we must fol-
the Mexicans.

low have represented the Mexicans to be more barbarous per-
haps than they really were. Their religious tenets, and the
rites of their worship, are described by them as wild and cruel
in an extreme degree. Religion, which occupies no confider-
able place in the thoughts of a savage, whose conceptions of any
superior power are obscure, and his sacred rites few and simple,
was formed, among the Mexicans, into a regular system, with
its complete train of priests, temples, victims, and feftivats.
This, of itself, is a clear proof that the state of the Mex-
icans was very different from that of the ruder American tribes.
But from the extravagance of their religious notions, or the
barbarity of their rites, no conclusion can be drawn with cer-
tainty concerning the degree of their civilization. For nations,
long after their ideas begin to enlarge, and their manners to
refine, adhere to systems of superstition founded on the rude
conceptions of early ages. From the genius of the Mexican
religion we may, however, form a most just conclusion with
respeCt to its influence upon the character of the people. The
aspect of superstition in Mexico was gloomy and atrocious. Its
divinities were clothed with terror, and delighted in vengeance.
They were exhibited to the people under detestable forms, which
created horror. The figures of serpents, of tygers, and of other
deftruative animals, decorated their temples. Fear was the only
principle that inspired their votaries. Fafis, mortifications, and
penances, all rigid and many of them excruciating to an extreme

degree,
30o

degree, were the means which they employed to appease the B 0 0 K
wrath of their gods, and they never approached their altars '-
without sprinkling them with blood drawn from their own bodies.
But, of all offerings, human sacrifices were deemed the most ac-
ceptable. This religious belief, mingling with the implacable
spirit of vengeance, and adding new force to it, every captive
taken in war was brought to the temple, was devoted as a viaim
to the deity, and sacrificed with rites no less solemn than cruel".
The heart and bead were the portion consecrated to the gods;
the warrior by whose prowess the prisoner had been seized, car-
ried off the body to feast upon it with his friends. Under the
impression of ideas so dreary and terrible, and accustomed daily
to scenes of bloodshed rendered awful by religion, the heart of
man muff harden, and be fleeled to every sentiment of hu-
manity. The spirit of the Mexicans was accordingly unfeel-
ing and atrocious. The genius of their religion so far coun-
terbalanced the influence of policy and arts, that, notwith-
standing their progress in both, their manners, instead of
softening, became more fierce. To what circumstances it was
owing that superstition assumed such a dreadful form among
the Mexicans, we have not sufficient knowledge of their history
to determine. But its influence is visible, and produced an
effct that is singular in the history of the human species. The
manners of the people in the New World who had made the
greatest progress in the arts of policy, were the most ferocious,
and the barbarity of some of their cufloms exceeded even thole
of the savage state.

flory, which the Peruvians could communicate to their con-
uncertain. querors, must have been both imperfect and uncertain Z. Like

the other American nations, they were totally unacquainted
with the art of writing, and destitute of the only means by
which the memory of past tranfaEions can be preserved with
any degree of accuracy. Even among people to whom the use
of letters is known, the aera where the authenticity of history
commences, is much posterior to the introduction of writing.
That noble invention continued long subservient to the common
business and wants of life, before it was employed in recording
events, with a view of conveying information from one age to
another. But in no country did ever tradition alone carry
down historic knowledge, in any full continued fiream during
a period of half the length that the monarchy of Peru is said to
have subsisted.

Defeas in THE Ziipos, or knots on cords of different colours, which

been regular annals of the empire, imperfectly supplied the
place of writing. According to the obscure description of them
by Acofta', which Garcilaffo de la Vega has adopted with little
variation and no improvement, the quipos seem to have been a
device for rendering calculation more expeditious and accurate.
By the various colours different objeds were denoted, and by
each knot a diflind number. Thus an account was taken, and
a kind of regifler kept, of the inhabitants in each province, or
of the several productions collected there for public use. But

of ancient events and inffitutions. The Mexican paintings and
symbols, rude as they were, conveyed to them more knowledge
of remote tranfaaions, than the Peruvians could derive from
their boasted quipos. Had the latter been even of more exten-
five use, and better adapted to supply the place of written re-
cords, they perished Co generally, together with other monu-
ments of Peruvian ingenuity, in the wreck occasioned by the
Spanish conquest, and the civil wars subsequent to it, that no
acceflion of light or knowledge comes from them. All the zeal
of Garcilaffo de la Vega for the honour of that race of monarchs
from whom he descended, all the industry of his researches, and
the superior advantages with which he carried them on, opened
no source of information unknown to the Spanish authors who
wrote before him. In his Royal Com2mentaries, he confines him-
self to illustrate what they had related concerning the antiquities
and institutions of Peru b; and his illustrations, like their
accounts, are derived entirely from the traditionary tales cur-
rent among his countrymen.

VERY little credit then is due to the minute details which

have been given of the exploits, the battles, the conquests, and
private character of the early Peruvian monarchs. We can
reft upon nothing in their story, as authentic, but a few
fads, so interwoven in the system of their religion and po-
licy, as preserved the memory of them from being loft; and

L_-v-..J fully to these, and endeavouring to separate them from what

appears to be fabulous, or of doubtful authority, I have la-
boured to form an idea of the Peruvian government and

manners.

Origin of THE people of Peru, as I have already observed ', had not
their civil
policy, advanced beyond the rudest form of savage life, when Manco

Capac, and his consort Mama Ocollo, appeared to inftruC and
civilize them. Who there extraordinary personages were, whe-
ther they imported their system of legislation and knowledge of
arts from some country more improved, or, if natives of Peru,
how they acquired ideas so far superior to those of the people
whom they addressed, are circumstances with refpet to which
the Peruvian tradition conveys no information. Manco Capac
and his consort, taking advantage of the propensity in the Pe-
ruvians to superstition, and particularly of their veneration for
the Sun, pretended to be children of that glorious luminary,.
and to deliver their inftruclions in his name and authority.
The multitude listened and believed. What reformation in
policy and manners the Peruvians ascribe to those founders of
their empire, and how, from the precepts of the Inca and his
consort, their ancestors gradually acquired some knowledge of
those arts, and some relish for that industry, which render sub-
fifience secure and life comfortable, hath been formerly related.
Those blessings were originally confined within narrow pre-
cinas; for the authority of the first Inca did not reach many
leagues beyond Cuzco. But, in process of time, his fucceflbrs,
extended their dominion over all the regions that stretch to the

weft of the Andes from Chili to Quito, establishing in every B O O K
province their peculiar policy and religious institutions.

THE most singular and firiking circumstance in the Peruvian Founded in

government, is the influence of religion upon its genius and religion.
laws. Religious ideas make such a feeble impression on the
mind of a savage, that their effect upon his sentiments and
manners are hardly perceptible. Among the Mexicans, reli-
gion, reduced into a regular fyflem, and holding a considerable
place in their public institutions, operated with conspicuous
efficacy in forming the peculiar character of that people. But
in Peru, the whole fyflem of civil policy was founded on reli-
gion. The Inca appeared not only as a legislator, but as the
messenger of Heaven. His precepts were received not merely
as the injunctions of a superior, but as the mandates of the
Deity. His race was held to be sacred; and in order to pre-
serve it diltinct, without being polluted by any mixture of infe-
rior blood, the sons of Manco Capac married their own fillers,
and no person was ever admitted to the throne who could not
claim it by such a pure descent. To those Children of the Sun,
for that was the appellation bellowed upon all the offspring of
the first Inca, the people looked up with the reverence due to
beings of a superior order. They were deemed to be under the
immediate protcLtion of the deity from whom they issued, and
by him every order of the reigning Inca was supposed to be
d ictated.

meaning of the words. Whenever the decrees of a prince are
confidered as the commands of the Divinity, it is not only an

1 r 2 act

307

' o o K ad of rebellion, but of impiety, to dispute or oppose his will.

_~._., Obedience becomes a duty of religion; and as it would be pro-
oer of the fane to controul a monarch under the guidance of Heaven, and
inca. presumptuous to advise him, nothing remains but to submit

with implicit refped. This must necessarily be the effec of
every government established on pretensions of intercourse with
superior powers. Such accordingly was the blind submission
which the Peruvians yielded to their sovereigns. The persons of
highest rank and greatest power in their dominions acknow-
ledged them to be of a more exalted nature; and in testimony
of this, when admitted into their presence, they entered with
a burden upon their shoulders, as an emblem of their servitude,
and willingness to bear whatever the Inca was pleased to impose.
Among their fubjeds, force was not requisite to second their
commands. Every officer entrusted with the execution of them
was revered, and, according to the account of an intelligent
observer of Peruvian manners d, might proceed alone from one
extremity of the empire to another, without meeting oppofi-
tion; for, on producing a fringe from the royal Borla, an or-
nament peculiar to the reigning Inca, the lives and fortunes of
the people were at his disposal.

A' c.irncs ANOTHER consequence of eftablifling government in Peru
t 1.1 y. on the foundation of religion was, that all crimes were pu-

nifhed capitally. They were not confidered ,as transgressions
of human laws, but as insults offered to the Deity. Each,
without any diflinCtion between such as were flight and fucli
as were atrocious, called for vengeance, and could be expiartcd
only by the blood of the offender. Consonantly to the fame
ideas, punifhlnent followed the trespass with inevitable ccr-

d Zaratc, li . i. c. 13

tainty, because an offence against Heaven was deemed such an B 00 K
high enormity as could not be pardoned '. Among a people -
of corrupted morals, maxims of jurisprudence so severe and
unrelenting, by rendering men ferocious and desperate, would
be more apt to multiply crimes than to restrain them. But the
Peruvians, of simple manners and unfufpicious faith, were
held in such awe by this rigid discipline, that the number of
offenders was extremely fminall. Veneration for monarchs,
enlightened and direced, as they believed, by the divinity
whom they adored, prompted them to their duty; the dread
of punishment, which they were taught to confider as unavoid-
able vengeance infliCed by offended Heaven, withheld them
from evil.

THE system of fupcrftition on which the Incas ingrafted Mild gcn:us

of their reli-

their pretensions to such high authority, was of a genius very giol.
different from that cftablifhed among the Mexicans. Manco
Capac turned the veneration of his followers entirely towards
natural objecs. The Sun, as the great source of light, of joy,
and fertility in the creation, attracted their principal homage.
The Moon and Stars, as co-operating with him, were entitled
to secondary honours. \Wherever the propenlity in the human
mind to acknowledge and to adore some fupcrior power, takes
this direCtion, and is employed in contemplating the order and
beneficence that really cxift in nature, the spirit of fiiperllition
is mild. \Vhcrcver imaginary beings, created by the fancy and
the fears of men, are fupprofcd to preside in nature, and become
the objccts of worflhip, fupcrflition always affumcs a more revere
and atrocious form. 01 the latter we have an example amorng

VII.
A - * Peruvians had not, indeed, made such progress in observation or

inquiry, as to have attained just conceptions of the Deity; nor
was there in their language any proper name or appellation of
the Supreme Power, which intimated that they had formed any
idea of him as the Creator and Governor of the World '. But by
directing their veneration to that glorious luminary, which, by
its universal and vivifying energy, is the best emblem of divine
beneficence, the rites and observances which they deemed ac-
ceptable to him were innocent and humane. They offered to
the Sun a part of those produtions which his genial warmth
had called forth from the bosom of the earth, and reared to
maturity. They sacrificed, as an oblation of gratitude, some
of the animals who were indebted to his influence for nourish-
ment. They presented to him choice specimens of those works
of ingenuity which his light had guided the hand of man in
forming. But the Incas never stained his altars with human
blood, nor'could they conceive that their beneficent father the
Sun would be delighted with such horrid victims g. Thus the
Peruvians, unacquainted with those barbarous rites which ex-
tinguifh sensibility, and suppress the feelings of nature at the
light of human sufferings, were formed, by the spirit of the
fuperffition which they had adopted, to a national charaCtcr
more gentle than that of any people in America.

Its influcrcc THIE influence of this superstition operated even upon their
ol civil civil inflitutions, and tended to correct in them whatever was

adverse to gentleness of character. The dominion of the Incas,
though the most absolute of all despotisms, was mitigated by its

VII.

pressed by the idea of a forced fubjedion to the will of a fupe- _._
rior; obedience, paid to one who was believed to be clothed
with divine authority, was willingly yielded, and implied no
degradation. The sovereign, conscious that the fubmiflive re-
verence of his people flowed from their belief of his heavenly
descent, was continually reminded of a ditlindion which
prompted him to imitate that beneficent power which he was.
supposed to represent. In consequence of those impressions,
there hardly occurs in the traditional history of Peru, any
inflance of rebellion against the reigning prince, and, among
twelve successive monarchs, there was not one tyrant.

EVEN the wars in which the Incas engaged, were carried and on their

mnilitary

on with a spirit very different from that of other American fvtim.Y
nations. They fought not, like savages, to destroy and exter-
minate; or, like the Mexicans, to glut blood-thirlty divinities
with human sacrifices. They conquered, in order to reclaim
and civilize the vanquilhed, and, to diffuse the knowledge of
their own institutions and arts. Prisoners seem not to have
been exposed to the insults and tortures, which were their lot
in every other part of the New World. The Incas took the
people whom they subdued under their protecion, and ad-
mitted them to a participation of all the advantages enjoyed
by their original fubjeds. This practice, so repugnant to
American ferocity, and resembling the humanity of the most
polished nations, must be ascribed, like other peculiarities
which we have observed in the Peruvian manners, to the genius
of their religion. The Incas, confidering the homage paid to
any objeCt but the heavenly powers which they adored, as im-
pious, were fond of gaining proselytes to their favourite fyflcm.

peculiar (late THF. slate of property in Peru was no less singular than that

popcry. of religion, and contributed, likewise, towards giving a mild

turn of character to the people. All the lands capable of cultiva-
tion were divided into three shares. One was consecrated to the
Sun, and the product of it was applied to the erection of
temples, and furnishing what was requisite towards celebrating
the public rites of religion. The second belonged to the Inca,
and was set apart as the provision made by the community for the
support of government. The third and largest share was reserved
for the maintenance of the people, among whom it was parcelled
out. No person, however, had a right of exclusive property
in the portion allotted to him. He possessed it only for a year,
at the expiration of which a new division was made in propor-
tion to the rank, the number, and exigencies of each family.
All those lands were cultivated by the joint industry of the
community. The people, summoned by a proper officer, re-
paired in a body to the fields, and performed their common
taik, while songs and musical instruments cheered them to

and of mutual subserviency was continually inculcated. Each B 01 K
individual felt his connection with those around him, and
knew that he depended on their friendly aid for what increase
he was to reap. A state thus constituted may be confidered as
one great family, in which the union of the members was so
complete, and the exchange of good offices so perceptible, as to
create fronger attachment, and to bind man to man in closer
intercourse, than subsisted under any form of society eftablified
in America. From this resulted gentle manners, and mild vir-
tues unknown in the savage state, and with which the Mexi-
cans were little acquainted.

was great inequality in their condition. The diftintion of
ranks was fully eflablifhed in Peru. A great body of the in-
habitants, under the denomination of ranaconas, were held in
a slate of servitude. Their garb and houses were of a form
different from those of free-men. Like the Tamelmes of
Mexico, they were employed in carrying burdens, and in per-
forming every other work of drudgery'. Next to them in
rank, were such of the people as were free, but diftinguilhed
by no official or hereditary honours. Above them were raised,
those whom the Spaniards call Orjonles, from the ornaments
worn in their ears. They formed what may be denominated
the order of nobles, and in peace, as well as war, held every
office of power or trust"'. At the head of all were the chil-
dren of the Sun, who, by their high dcfcent, and peculiar pri-

State of arts. SUCH a form of society, from the union of its members, as

well as from the diftincion in their ranks, was favourable to
progress in the arts. But the Spaniards having been ac-
quainted with the improved state of various arts in Mexico,
several years before they discovered Peru, were not so much
firuck with what they observed in the latter country, and de-
scribe the appearances of ingenuity there with less warmth of
admiration. The Peruvians, nevertheless, had advanced far
beyond the Mexicans, both in the necessary arts of life, and in
such as have some title to the name of elegant.

Improved IN Peru, agriculture, the art of primary necessity in social
cul'kre. Elise, was more extensive, and carried on with greater skill

than in any part of America. The Spaniards, in their progress
through the country, were so fully supplied with provisions
of every kind, that in the relation of their adventures we meet
with few of those dismal scenes of distress occasioned by fa-
mine, in which the conquerors of Mexico were so often in-
volved. Thequantity of foil under cultivation was not left to the
discretion of individuals, but regulated by public authority in
proportion to the exigencies of the community. Even the
calamity of an unfruitful season was but little felt, for the pro-
du& of the lands consecrated to the Sun, as well as those fct
apart for the Inca, being deposited in the T7inlbos, or public
florchoufes, it remained there as a flated provision for times
of fearcity" As the extent of cultivation was determined with

such provident attention to the demands of the state, the in- B °0 K
vention and industry of the Peruvians were called forth to ex-
traordinary exertions, by certain defects peculiar to their cli-
mate and bfil. All the vast irivers that flow from the Andes
take their course eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. Peru is wa-
tered only by some fireams which rush down from the moun-
tains like torrents. A great part of the low-country is
sandy and barren, and never refreflied with rain. In order to
render such an unpromising region fertile, the ingenuity of the
Peruvians had recourse to various expedients. By means of
artificial canals conduced, with much patience and confider-
able art, from the torrents that poured across their country,
they conveyed a regular supply of moisture to their fields °.
They enriched the foil by manuring it with the dung of sea-
fowls, of which they found an inexhaustible store on all the
islands scattered along their coasts '. In describing the cutfoms
of any nation thoroughly civilized, such practices would hard-
ly draw attention, or be mentioned as in any degree remark-
able, but in the hitfory of the improvident race of men in
the New World, they are entitled to notice as singular proofs
of industry and of art. The use of the plough, indeed, was
unknown to the Peruvians. They turned up the earth with
a kind of mattock of hard wood '. Nor was this labour deemed
so degrading as to be devolved wholly upon the women. Both
sexes joined in performing this necessary work. Even the
children of the Sun set an example of industry, by cultivating
a field near Cuzco with their own hands, and they dignified
this function by denominating it their triumph over the earth '.

Their build-

r uild- In the extensive plains which stretch along the Pacific Ocean,

where the sky is perpetually serene, and the climate mild, their
houses were very properly of a fabric extremely flight. But
in the higher regions, where rain falls, where the vicissitude of
seasons is known, and their rigour felt, houses were conftruaed
with greater solidity. They were generally of a square form,
the walls about eight feet high, built with bricks hardened in
the fun, the door low and firait, and without any windows.
Simple as these ftrudures were, and rude as the materials may
seem to be of which they were formed, they were so durable, thaz
many of them fill subsist in different parts of Peru, long after
every monument that might have conveyed to us any idea of the
domestic state of the other American nations has vanished from
the face of the earth. But it was in the temples consecrated to
the Sun, and in the buildings destined for the residence of their
monarchs, that the Peruvians displayed the utmost extent of
their art and contrivance. The descriptions of them by such
of the Spanish writers as had an opportunity of contemplating
them while, in some measure, entire, might have appeared
highly exaggerated, if the ruins which till remain, did not
vouch the truth of their relations. These ruins of sacred or
royal buildings are found in every province of the empire,
and by their frequency demonstrate that they are monuments
of a powerful people, who must have fubfffied, during a pe-
riod of some extent, in a fate of no inconsiderable improve-
ment. They appear to have been edifices various in their di-
mcnfions. Some of a moderate size, many of immense extent,
all remarkable for solidity, and refcmbling each other in the
filc of architclure. The temple of Pachacamac, togcthcr

with
316

with a palace of the Inca, and a fortress, were so conneced to- B 0 ° K
gether as to form one great ftruaure, above half a league in .-
circuit. In this prodigious pile, the fame singular taste in build-
ing is conspicuous, as in other works of the Peruvians. As
they were unacquainted with the use of the pulley, and other
mechanical powers, and could not elevate the large stones and
bricks which they employed in building to any considerable
height, the walls of this edifice, in which they seem to have
made their greatest effort towards magnificence, did not rife
above twelve feet from the ground. Though they had not dif-
covered the use of mortar or of any other cement in building,
the bricks or stones were joined with so much nicety, that the
seams can hardly be discerned'. The apartments, as far as the
distribution of them can be traced in the ruins, were ill-difpofed,
and afforded little accommodation. There was not a single
window in any part of the building, and as no light could en-
ter but by the door, all the apartments of largest dimension mufI
either have been perfectly dark, or illuminated by some other
means. But with all these and many other imperfections that
might be mentioned in their art of building, the works of the
Peruvians which dtill remain, mutt be confidered as flupendous
efforts of a people unacquainted with the use of iron, and con-
vey to us an high idea of the power pofTcf'ed by their ancient
monarchs.

of the Incas. The two great roads from Cuzco to Quito, cx- roads,
tending in an uninterrupted flrctch above five hundred leagues,
are entitled to still higher praise. The one was conductcd

B o0 K through the interior and mountainous country, the other
-----' through the plains on the sea-coast. From the language of ad-

miration in which some of the early writers express their aflo-
nifhmcnt when they first viewed those roads, and from the
more pompous descriptions of later writers, who labour to sup-
port some favourite theory concerning America, one might be
led to compare this work of the Incas to the famous military
ways which remain as monuments of the Roman power: But
in a country where there was no tame animal except the Llama,
which was never used for draught, and but little as a beast of bur-
den, where the high roads were seldom trod by any but a human
foot, no great degree of labour or art was requisite in forming
them. The Peruvian roads were only fifteen feet in breadth',
jind in many places so slightly formed, that time has effaced
every vestige of the course in which they ran. In the low
country little more seems to have been done, than to plant trees
or to fix posts at certain intervals, in order to mark the proper
route to travellers. To open a path through the mountainous
country was a more arduous talk. Eminencies were levelled,
and hollows filled up, and for the preservation of the road, it
was fenced with a bank of turf. At proper diflances, Tambos,
or storehouses, were erected for the accommodation of the Inca
and his attendants, in their progress through his dominions.
From the manner in which the road was originally formed in
this higher and more impervious region, it has proved more
durable; and though, from the inattention of the Spaniards to
every objec but that of working their mines, nothing has been
done towards keeping it in repair, its course may still be traced '.

description, divested of every circumstance of manifest exagge- -
ration, or of suspicious aspea, it must be confidered as a ftrik-
ing proof of an extraordinary progress in improvement and
policy. To the savage tribes of America, the idea of faci-
litating communication with places at a distance had never oc-
curred. To the Mexicans it was hardly known. Even in the
most civilized countries of Europe, men had advanced far
in refinement, before it became a regular object of na-
tional police to form such roads as render intercourse com-
modious.

ment in Peru equally unknown over all the reft of America.
In its course from south to north, the road of the Incas was in-
terfecqed by all the torrents which roll from the Andes towards
the Western Ocean. Irom the rapidity of their course, as well
as from the frequency and violence of their inundation, there
were unnavigable. Some expedient, however, was to be found
for pafling them. The Peruvians, from their unacquaintance
with the uic of arches, and their inability to work in wood,
could not confirult bridges either of flone or timber. But necef-
lity, the parent of invention, fuggcflcd a device which iUpplied
tlhat dcfct. They formred cables of great flrength, by twiR-
ing together lfme of the pliable witlis or osiers, with which
their country abounds ; fix of which they firetched acrots the
fiream parallel to one another, and made them fafl on each fide.
These they bound firmly together by interweavinrg finallcr ropes.

In the level country, where the rivers became deep and broad
and still, they are passed in Balzas, or floats; in the confiruc-
tion, as well as navigation of which, the ingenuity of the Peru-
vians appears to be far superior to that of any people in America.
There had advanced no farther in naval skill than the use of the
paddle, or oar; the Peruvians ventured to raise a mast, and spread
a fail, by means of which their balzas not only went nimbly be-
fore the wind, but could veer and tack with great celerity '.

Mode of re- NOR were the ingenuity and art of the Peruvians confined sole-
sing filery to objets of essential utility. They had made some progress

in arts, which may be called elegant. They possessed the pre-
cious metals in greater abundance than any people of America.
They obtained gold in the fame manner with the Mexicans, by
searching in the channels of rivers, or walhing the earth in
which particles of it were contained. But in order to procure
silver, they exerted no inconsiderable degree of skill and in-
vention. They had not, indeed, attained the art of finking a
shaft into the bowels of the earth, and penetrating to the riches
concealed there; but they hollowed deep caverns on the banks
of rivers and the fides of mountains, and emptied such veins as
did not dip suddenly beyond their reach. In other placcs,
where the vein lay near the surface, they dug pits to such a
depth, that the person who worked below culd throw out the

naces on high grounds, so artificially confiruded, that the
draught of air performed the function of a bellows, an engine
with which they were totally unacquainted. By this simple
device, the purer ores were finelted with facility, and
the quantity of silver in Peru was so considerable, that
many of the utensils employed in the functions of common
life were made of itb. Several of those vessels and trinkets
are said to have merited no finall degree of estimation, on ac-
count of the neatness of the workmanship, as well as the in-
trinfic value of the materials. But as the conquerors of Ame-
rica were well acquainted with the latter, but had scarcely any
conception of the former, most of them were melted down,
and rated according to their weight and fineness in the division
of the spoil.

was hardened so tedious, that their infiruments of copper were
few, and so extremely finall, that they seem to have been em-
ployed only in flighter works. But even to such a circumscribed
use of this imperfect metal, the Peruvians were indebted for
their superiority to the other people of America in various arts '.
The fame observation, however, may be applied to them, which
I formerly made with refpe& to the arts of the Mexicans. From
several specimens of Peruvian utensils and ornaments, which
are deposited in the royal cabinet of Madrid, and from rome
preserved in different collections in other parts of Europe, I
have reason to believe, that the workmanship is more to be ad-
*mired on account of the rude tools with which it was executed,
than on account of its intrinsic neatness and elegance, and that
the Peruvians, though the most improved of all the Americans,
were not advanced beyond the infancy of arts.

fetly the spirit, or assume the manners of social life. In a B13 0 K
country of immense extent, with only one city, the progress
of manners, and the improvement either of the neceflary or
more refined arts, must have been so flow, and carried on un-
der such disadvantages, that it is more surprising the Peruvians
should have advanced so far in refinement, than that they did
not proceed farther.

IN consequence of this state of imperfect union, the fepara- Noperfea

tion of professions in Peru was not so complete as among the proferaion.o
Mexicans. The less closely men associate, the more simple are
their manners, and the fewer their wants. The crafts'of com-
mon and most necessary use in life do not, in such a state, be-
come so complex or difficult, as to render it requisite that men
should be trained to them by any particular course of education.
All those professions were accordingly exercised by every Peru-
vian indiscriminately. None but the artists, employed in works
of mere curiosity or ornament, constituted a separate order of
men, or were distinguished from other citizens e.

co-eval with the foundation of cities; and from the moment
that the members of any community fettle in considerable num-
bers in one place, its operations become vigorous. The ci-
tizen must depend for subsistence on the labour of thole who
cultivate the ground. They, in return, must receive some

equivalent. Thus mutual intercourse is established, and the.
productions of art are regularly exchanged for the fruits.
of agriculture. In the towns of the Mexican empire, stated
markets were held, and whatever could supply any want or
desire of man was an objec of commerce. But in Peru, from
the singular mode of dividing property, and the manner
in which the people were fettled, there was hardly any
species of commerce carried on between different provinces ',
and the community was less acquainted with that acive inter-
course, which is at once a bond. of union, and an incentive to
improvement.

BUT the unwarlike spirit of the Peruvians was the most re-

markable, as well as most fatal defect in their characer a. The
greater part of the rude nations of America opposed their in-
vaders with undaunted ferocity, though with little conduc or
success. The Mexicans maintained the struggle in defence of
their liberties, with such persevering fortitude, that it was with,
difficulty the Spaniards triumphed over them.. Peru was sub-
dued at once, and almost without resistance; and the most
favourable opportunities of regaining their freedom, and of
crushing their oppressors, were loft through the timidity of the
people. Though the traditional history of the Peruvians re-
presents all the Incas as warlike princes, frequently at the head
of armies, which they led to victory and conquest; few fymp-
toms of such a martial spirit appear in any-of their operations
subsequent to the invasion of the Spaniards. The influence,
perhaps, of those institutions which rendered their manners

their government, unknown to us, was the occasion of this po-
litical debility. Whatever may have been the cause, the fat
is certain, and there is not an instance in hiflory of any people
so little advanced in refinement, so totally deflitute of military
talents and enterprize. This characer hath descended to their
posterity. The Indians of Peru are now more tame and de-
pressed than any people of America. Their feeble spirits, re-
laxed in lifeless inaction, feemr hardly capable of any bold or.
manly exertion.

BUT, besides those capital defeEts in the political slate of-

Peru, some detached circumstances and fads occur in the Spa-
nifh writers, which discover a considerable remainder of bar-
barity in their manners. A cruel cuflom, that prevailed in
some of the most savage tribes, subsistcd among the Peruvians.
On the death of the Incas, and of other eminent persons, a
considerable number of their attendants was put to death,
and interred around their Guaca, that they might appear in
the next world with their former dignity, and be fcrved with

fertile, and all their productions, whether animal or vegetable,
are most perfect in their kind. They have all a communication
either with the Pacific Ocean, or with the Gulf of Mexico, and
are watered by such rivers as not only enrich them, but may
become subservient to commerce. The number of Spaniards
fettled in those vast countries, is indeed extremely small. They
may be said to have subdued, rather than to have occupied them.
But if the population in their ancient establishments in Ame-
rica shall continue to increase, they may gradually spread over

A recent and A recent and singular instance of this has happened, which, as
remarkable
discovery. it is but little known in Europe, and may be productive of

*great effects, merits attention. The Spaniards fettled in the
provinces of Cinaloa and Sonora, had been long diflurbed by the
depredations of some fierce tribes of Indians. In the year 1765,
the incursions of those savages became so frequent. and so deitruc-
tive, that the Spanish inhabitants, in despair, applied to the Mar-
quis de Croix, viceroy of Mexico, for such a body of troops as
might enable them to drive those formidable invaders fiom their
places of retreat in the mountains. But the treasury of Mexico
was so much exhausted by the vast fums drawn from it, in or-
der to support the late war against Great Britain, that the vice-
roy could afford them no aid. The refpe& due to his virtues,
accomplished what his official power could not effect. He pre-
vailed with the merchants to advance about two hundred thou-
sand pesos for defraying the expence of the expedition. The
war was conducted by an officer of abilities; and after being
protracted for three years, chiefly by the difficulty of pursuing
the fugitives over mountains and through defiles which were
almost impassable, it terminated in the year 1771, in the final sub-
mission of the tribes, which had been so long the object of
terror to the two provinces. In the course of this service, the
Spaniards marched through countries into which they seem not
to have penetrated before that time, and discovered mines of
such value, as was altonifling even to men acquainted with the
riches contained in the mountains of the New World. At
Cineguilla, in the province of Sonora, they entered a plain of
fourteen leagues in extent, in which they found gold in grains,
at the depth of only fixtcen inches, of such a size, that bfmc

of
328

of them weighed nine marks, and in such quantities, that in a B 0 0 K
flort time, with a few labourers, they collected a thousand __---
marks of gold in grains, even without taking time to wash the
earth that had been dug, which appeared to be so rich, that
persons of skill computed that it might yield what would be
equal in value to a million of pesos. Before the end of the
year 177r, above two thousand persons were fettled in Probable
Cineguilla, under the government of proper magistrates,
and the infpetion of several ecclesiastics. As several other
mines:' not inferior in riches to that of Cineguilla, have been
discovered, both in Sonora and Cinaloa k, it is probable that
these negleced and thinly inhabited provinces, may soon be-
come as populous and valuable as any part of the Spanish empire
in America.

THE peninsula of California on the other fide of the California,

Vermilion Tea, seems to have been less known to the an- its fate,
cient Mexicans, than the provinces which I have mentioned.
It was discovered by Cortes in the year r536'. During a
long period it continued to be so little frequented, that even
its form was unknown, and in molt charts it was repre-
sented as an island, not as a peninsula '. Though the climate of
this country, if we may judge from its situation, must be very
desirable; the Spaniards have made small progrcfs in peopling
it. Towards the close of the last century, the Jcfuits, who had
great merit in exploring this ncglected province, and in civilizing
its rude inhabitants, imperceptibly acquired a dominion over it
as complete as that which they pofeffed in their millions in Pa-

and to govern the natives by the fame maxims. In order to
prevent the court of Spain from conceiving any jealousy of their
designs and operations, they seem fludioufly to have depreciat-
ed the country, by representing the climate as so disagreeable
and unwholesome, and the foil as so barren, that nothing
but a zealous desire of converting the natives, could have in-
duced them to fettle there m. Several public-fpirited citizens en-
deavoured to undeceive their sovereigns, and to give them a

andprobabi- better view of California; but in vain. At length, on the ex-
p10rovfts im- pulfion of the Jesuits from the Spanish dominions, the court of

Madrid, as prone at that jundure to fufped the purity of the
Order's intentions, as formerly to confide in them with implicit
trust, appointed Don Joseph Galvez, whose abilities have since
raised him to the high rank of minister for the Indies, to visit that
peninsula. His account of the country was favourable; he found
the pearl fishery on its coasts to be valuable, and discovered mines
of gold of a very promising appearance ". From its vicinity to
Cinaloa and Sonora, it is probable, that if the population of these
provinces ihall increase in the manner which I have supposed,
California may, by degrees, receive from them such a recruit of
inhabitants, as to be no longer reckoned among the desolate and
useless diftrids of the Spanish empire.

Yucatan and ON the east of Mexico, Yucatan and Honduras are comprehend-
lunduras. ed in the government of New Spain, though anciently they can

hardly be said to have formed a part of the Mexican empire.
These large provinces, firetching from the Bay of Campeachy
beyond Cape Gracias a Dios, do not, like the other territories

of Spain in the New World, derive their value either from the B o o K

fertility of their foil, or the richness of their mines, but they .....
produce in greater abundance, than any part of America, the
logwood tree, which, in dying some colours, is so far preferable
to any other material, that the consumption of it in Europe is
considerable, and it has become an article in commerce of great
value. During a long period, no European nation intruded
upon the Spaniards in those provinces, or attempted to obtain
any share in this branch of trade. But after the conquest of Ja-
maica by the English, it soon appeared what a formidable rival
was now feated in the neighbourhood of the Spanish territories.
One of the first objects which tempted the English, was the great
profit arising from the logwood trade, and the facility of wresting
some portion of it from the Spaniards. Some adventurers from Their de-
Jamaica made the first attempt at Cape Catoche, the south-east
promontory of Yucatan, and by cutting logwood there, carried
on a gainful traffic. When most of the trees near the coast in
that place were felled, they removed to the island of Trift, in
the Bay of Campeachy; and in later times, their principal fla-
tion has been in the Bay of Honduras. The Spaniards, alarm-
ed at this encroachment, endeavoured by negociation, remon-
firances, and open force, to prevent the English from obtaining
any footing on that part of the American continent. But after
firuggling againfl it for more than a century, the disasters of
lat war extorted from the court of Madrid a reluclant consent
to tolerate this settlement of foreigners in the heart of its terri-
tories o. The pain which this humbling concenion occasioned,
seems to have prompted the Spaniards to devise a method of
rendering it of little confequcnce, more effectual than all the

and permitting the importation of it into Spain without paying

merce, and the logwood which the English bring to market
has funk so much in value, that their trade to the Bay of Hon-
duras has gradually declined q since it obtained a legal fanaion;
and, it is probable, will soon be finally abandoned. In that
event, Yucatan and Honduras will become pofteffions of con-
fiderable importance to Spain.

CoftaRica STILL farther east than Honduras lie the two provinces of
and eragua. Costa Rica and Veragua, which likewise belong to the vice-roy-

alty of New Spain; but both have been so much neglected by
the Spaniards, and are apparently of such small value, that they
merit no particular attention.
Chili. THE most important province depending on the vice-royalty

of Peru, is Chili. The Incas had efabliihed their dominion
in some of its southern difirids; but in the greater part of the
country, its gallant and high-fpirited inhabitants maintained
their independence. The Spaniards, allured by the fame of
its opulence, early attempted the conquest of it under Diego Al-
magro; and after his death, Pedro de Valdivia refunmce the dc-
sign. Both met with fierce opposition. The former rclin-
quiflcd the entcrprize in the manner which I have mentioned'.

and military ikill, was cut off together with a considerable body
of troops under his command. Francisco de Villagra, Valdi-
via's lieutenant, by his spirited conduct, checked the natives in
their career, and saved the remainder of the Spaniards from de-
ftrudion. By degrees, all the champaign country along the coast
was subjeCted to the Spanish dominion. The mountainous
country is still possessed by the Puelches, Araucos, and other
tribes of its original inhabitants, formidable neighbours to the
Spaniards; with whom, during the course of two centuries,
they have been obliged to maintain almost perpetual hoflility,
furpended only by a few intervals of insecure peace.

TH AT part of Chili then, which may properly be deemed a

Spanish province, is a narrow diftrid, extending along the coast
from the desert of Atacamas to the island of Cliloe, above nine
hundred miles. Its climate is the most delicious in the New
World, and is hardly equalled by that of any region on the
face of the earth. Though bordering on the Torrid Zone, it
never feels the extremity of heat, being screened on the eafl by
the Andes, and refrifhcd from the weft by cooling fea-breezcs.
The temperature of the air is so mild and equable, that the Spa-
niards give it the preference to that of the foutliern provinces
in their native country. The fertility of the foil corresponds
with the benignity of the climate, and is wonderfully accommo-
dated to European productions. The molt valuable of these,
corn, wine, and oil, abound in Clili, as if they had been na-
tive to the country. All'tle fruits inmported from Europe attain
to full maturity there. The animals of our licmifpelcrc not on-

being ne-
gle&ed by apt to conclude, would early become a favourite station of the
the Spa-
niards. Spaniards, and muff have been cultivated with peculiar predi-

lecQion and care. Instead of this a great part of it remains
unoccupied. In all this extent of country, there are not above
eighty thousand white inhabitants, and about three times that
number of negroes and people of a mixed race. The moss ser-
tile foil in America lies uncultivated, and some of its most pro-
mifing mines remain unwrought. Strange as this neglect of
the Spaniards to avail themselves of advantages, which seemed
to court their acceptance, may appear, the causes of it can be
traced. The only intercourse of Spain with its colonies in the
South Sea, was carried on during two centuries by the annual
fleet to Porto-bello. All the produce of the colonies were flhip-
ped in the ports of Callao, or Arica in Peru, for Panama, and
carried from thence across the ifihmus. All the commodities
which they received from the mother-country, were conveyed
from Panama to the fame harbours. Thus both the exports
and imports of Chili pasTed through the hinds of merchants
fettled in Peru. These had of course a profit on each; and
in both tranfaclions the Chilefe felt their own fibordi-
nation; and having no diret intercourse with the parent
fate, they depended upon another province for the disposal
of their productions, as well as for the supply of their wants.
Under such difcouragcments, population could not increase,

Horn, a direct intercourse is opened between Chili and the Mo-
ther-country. The gold, the silver, and the other commodi-
ties of the province will be exchanged in its own harbours
for the manufactures of Europe. Chili may speedily rife into
that importance among the Spanish Settlements to which it is
entitled by its natural advantages. It may become the granary
of Pcru, and the other provinces along the Pacific Ocean; it
may supply them with wine, with cattle, with horses, with
hemp, and many other articles for which they now depend up-
on Europe. Though the new system has been established only
a few years, those effects of it begin already to be observed .
If it shall be adhered to with any steadiness for half a century,
one may venture to foretell, that population, industry, and
opulence will advance in this province with rapid progress.

To the east of the Andes, the provinces of Tucuman and Rio Provinces of

vision, until I enter upon the history of Portuguese America,
with which it is intimately conneted ; and, in relating it, I ihall
be able from authentic materials, supplied both by Spain and
Portugal, to give a full and accurate description of the operations
and views of the Jesuits, in rearing that singular fabric of policy
in America, which has drawn so much attention, and hasbeen To
imperfetly understood. The latter division of the province
contains the governments of Tucuman and Buenos-Ayres, and
to these I shall at present confine my observations.

View of the THE Spaniards entered this part of America by the river De la
latter. Plata, and though a fucceflion of cruel disasters besel them in their

early attempts to establish their dominion there, they were en-
couraged to persist in the design, at first by the hopes of discover-
ing mines in the interior country, and afterwards by the necessity
of occupying it, in order to prevent any other nation from fettling
there, and penetrating by this route into their rich poffeflfons
in Peru. But except Buenos-Ayres, they have made no fettle-
ment of any consequence in all the vast space which I have
mentioned. There are, indeed, scattered over it, a few places
on which they have bestowed the name of towns, and to which
they have endeavoured to add some dignity, by ereating them
into bishoprics; but they are no better than paltry vil-
lages, each with two or three hundred inhabitants. One cir-
cumnfance, however, which was not originally foreseen, has
contributed to render this diftrid, though thinly peopled, of
considerable importance. The province of Tucuman, together
with the country to the south of the Plata, inflcad of being

4 covcrc(l

covered with wood like other parts of America, forms one vait B VO K
open plain, almost without a tree. The foil is a deep fertile '--
mold, watered by many streams descending from the Andes,
and clothed in perpetual verdure. In this rich pasturage, the
horses and cattle imported by the Spaniards from Europe have
multiplied to a degree which almost exceeds belief. This has
enabled the inhabitants not only to open a lucrative trade with
Peru, by supplying it with cattle, horses, and mules, but to
carry on a commerce no less beneficial, by the exportation of
hides to Europe. From both the colony has derived great ad-
vantages. But its commodious situation for carrying on con-
traband trade, has been the chief source of its prosperity. While
the court of Madrid adhered to its ancient system, with respect
to its communication with America, the river De la Plata
lay so much out of the course of Spanifi navigation, that in-
terlopers, almost without any rifque of being either observed or
obftruaed, could pour in European manufactures in such quan-
tities, that these not only supplied the wants of the colony, but
were conveyed into all the eastern diftriEts of Peru. When
the Portuguese in Brasil extended their settlements to the banks
of Rio de la Plata, a new channel was opened, by which pro-
hibited commodities flowed into the Spanifl territories, with
lill more facility, and in greater abundance. This illegal traffic,
however detrimental to the parent state, contributed to the in-
crease of the settlement, which had the immediate benefit of it,
and Buenos Ayres became gradually a populous and opulent
town. What may be the effect of the alteration lately made in the
government of this colony, the nature of which shall be defcrib-
cd in the subsequent Book, cannot hitherto be known.

Other terri- merly given an account, are comprehended under two great
Spain. divisions; the former denominated the kingdom Tierra Firme,

the provinces of which firetch along the Atlantic, from the
eastern frontier of New Spain to the mouth of the Orinoco;
the latter, the New Kingdom of Granada, situated in the inte-
rior country. With a ihort view of these I shall close this part
of my work.

To the east of Veragua, the last province subjea to the vice-
Darien. roy of Mexico, lies the isthmus of Darien. Though it was in

this part of the continent that the Spaniards first began to plant
colonies, they have made no considerable progress in peopling
it. As the country is extremely mountainous, deluged with
rain during a good part of the year, remarkably unhealthful,
and contains no mines of great value, the Spaniards would pro-
bably have abandoned it altogether, if they had not been allured
to continue by the excellence of the harbour of Porto-bello on
the one sea, and that of Panama on the other. These have been
called the keys to the communication between the north and
south sea, between Spain and her most valuable colonies. In
consequence of this advantage, Panama has become a confider-
able and thriving town. The peculiar noxioufiefs of its cli-
mate has prevented Porto-bello from increasing in the fame
proportion. As the intercourse with the settlements in the Pa-
cific Ocean, is now carried on by another channel, it is pro-
bable that both Porto-bello and Panama will decline, when no
longer nourished and enriched by that commerce, to which
they were indebted for their prosperity, and even their exist-
ence.

this part of America to the crown of Spain, about the year
1532. It is thinly peopled, and of course ill cultivated. It
produces, however, a variety of valuable drugs, and some
precious tfones, particularly emeralds. But its chief import-
ance is derived from the harbour of Carthagena, the safest and
best fortified of any in the American dominions of Spain. In a
situation so favourable, commerce soon began to flourish. As
early as the year 1544, it seems to have been a town of some
note. But when Carthagena was chosen as the port in which
the galeons should first begin to trade on their arrival from Eu-
rope, and to which they were direCed to return, in order to
prepare for their voyage homeward, the commerce of its inha-
bitants was so much favoured by this arrangement, that it soon
became one of the most populous, opulent, and beautiful cities
in America. There is, however, reason to apprehend, that it
has reached its highest point of exaltation, and that it will be
so far affeCted by the change in the Spanifhl syRem of trade
with America, which has withdrawn from it the desirable visits
of the galeons, as to feel at least a temporary decline. But the
wealth now collected there, must find or create employment for
itself, and may be turned with advantage into some new chan-
nel. Its harbour is so safe, and so conveniently situated for re-
ceiving commodities from Europe, its merchants have been
so long accuflomed to convey there into all the adjacent pro-
vinces, that it is probable they will fill retain this branch of
trade, and Carthagena continue to be a city of great im-
portance.

B 0 0 K THE province contiguous to Santa Martha on the east, was
a _c-- firfi visited by Alonfo de Ojeda, in the year 1499'; and the
Venezuela.

Spaniards, on their landing there, having observed some huts in
an Indian village built upon piles, in order to raise them above
the stagnated water which covered the plain, were led to bellow
upon it the name of Venezuela, or little Venice, by their usual
propensity to find a resemblance, between what they discovered
in America, and the objedts which were familiar to them in
Europe. They made some attempts to fettle there, but with
little success. The final redution of the province was accom-
plifhed by means very different from those to which Spain was
indebted for its other acquisitions in the New World. The
ambition of Charles V. often engaged him in operations of such
variety and extent, that his revenues were not sufficient to de-
fray the expence of carrying them into execution. Among
other expedients for supplying the deficiency of his funds, he
had borrowed large fums from the Velfers of Augfburgh, the
most opulent merchants at that time in Europe. By way of retri-
bution for there, or in hopes, perhaps, of obtaining a new loan,
he beflowed upon them the province of Venezuela, to be held
as an hereditary fief of the crown of Castile, on condition that
within a limited time they fiould render themselves maflers of
the country, and cflablifl a colony there. Under the direction
of such perbons, it might have been expected, that a settlement
would have been eftablifled on maxims very different from
those of the Spaniards, and better calculated to encourage such
useful indlurfry, as they might have known to be the only certain
source of profpcrity and opulence, But unfortunately they com-
mitted the execution of their plan, to some of those soldiers of

might speedily abandon a flation which they soon discovered to
he very uncomfortable, inflead of planting a colony in order to
cultivate and improve the country, wandered from diftria to
difirid in search of mines, plundering the natives with unfeel-
ing rapacity, or oppressing them by the imposition of intole-
rable talks. In the course of a few years, their avarice and
exations, in comparison with which those of the Spaniards
were moderate, desolated the province so completely, that it
could hardly afford them subsistence, and the Velfers relinquiflh-
ed a property, from which the inconsiderate con-duC of their
agents left them no hope of ever deriving any advantage".
When the wretched remainder of the Germans deserted Vene-
zuela, the Spaniards again took possession of it; but, notwith-
standing many natural advantages, it is one of thei most lan-
guifhing and unproductive settlements.

THE provinces of Caraccas and Cumana are the lass of the Caracca and

Spanifli territories on this coast; but in relating the origin and Cla
operations of the mercantile company, in which an exclusive
right of trade with them has been veiled, I shall hereafter have
occasion to confider their slate and producions.

B 0o K former, who commanded at that time in Quito, attacked it from
--- the south; the latter made his invasion from Santa Martha on

the north. As the original inhabitants of this region were far-
ther advanced in improvement, than any people in America but
the Mexicans and Peruvians', they defended themselves with
great resolution and good conduCt. The abilities and perfeve-
rance of Benalcazar and Quefada surmounted all opposition,
though not without encountering many dangers, and reduced
the country into the form of a Spanish province.

THE New Kingdom of Granada is so far elevated above the level

of the sea, that though it approaches almost to the equator, the
climate is remarkably temperate. The fertility of its vallies is not
inferior to that of the richest diftrias in America, and its higher
grounds yield gold and precious flones of various kinds. It is
not by digging into the bowels of the earth that this gold is
found; it is mingled with the foil near the surface, and feparat-
ed from it by repeated washing with water. This operation is
carried on wholly by negroe slaves; for though the chill fubter-
ranean air has been discovered, by experience, to be so fatal to
them, that they cannot be employed in the deep silver mines,
they are more capable of performing the other species of labour
than Indians. As the natives in the New Kingdom of Grenada
are exempt from that service, which has wafted their race so
rapidly in other parts of America, it is remarkably populous.
Some diftridts yield gold with a profusion no less wonderful than
that in the vale of Cineguilla, which I have formerly mentioned,
and it is often found in large pepitas, or grains, which mani-
fest the abundance in which it is produced. On a riing ground

This, which is, perhaps, the largest and finert specimen ever

net of Madrid. But without founding any calculation on what
is rare and extraordinary, the value of the gold usually colleced
in this country, particularly in the provinces of Popayan and
Choco, is of considerable amount. Its towns are populous
and flourishing. The number of inhabitants in almost every
part of the country daily increases. Cultivation and industry
of various kinds begin to be encouraged, and to prosper. A
considerable trade is carried on with Carthagena, the produce
of the mines, and other commodities, being conveyed down
the great river of St. Magdalen to that city. On another quar-
ter, the New Kingdom of Granada has a communication with
the Atlantic by the river Orinoco; but the country which
firetches along its banks towards the eat, is little known, and
imperfectly occupied by the Spaniards.

THE first visible confequencc of the cflablifirnents made Depopulation

VIII.
As -_-', rable. I have already, on different occasions, mentioned the

disastrous influence under which the connection of the Ameri-
cans with the people of our hemisphere commenced, both in
the islands, and in several parts of the continent, and have
touched upon various causes of their rapid consumption. Where-
ever the inhabitants of America had resolution to take arms in
defence of their liberty and rights, many perished in the un-
equal contest, and were cut off by their fierce invaders. But
the greatest desolation followed after the sword was sheathed,

Causes of this and the conquerors were fettled in tranquillity. It was in the
in the islands,
andfomneparts islands, and in those provinces of the continent which stretch
of the conti- from the Gulf of Trinidad to the confines of Mexico, that the

fatal effeas of the Spanish dominion were first and most fen-
sibly felt. All these were occupied either by wandering tribes
of hunters, or by such as had made but small progress in cul-
tivation and industry. When they were compelled by their
new masters to take up a fixed residence, and to apply to regu-
lar labour; when talks were imposed upon them difpropor-
tioned to their strength, and were exated with unrelenting fe-
verity, they possessed not vigour either of mind or of body to
sustain this unusual load of oppression. Dejetion and dcfpair
drove many to end their lives by violence. Fatigue and famine
destroyed more. In all those extensive regions, the original
race of inhabitants wafted away; in fomle it was totally ex-
tinguifhed. In Mexico, where a powerful and martial peo-
ple diftinguiffied their opposition to the Spaniards, by efforts
of courage worthy of a better fate, great numbers fell in tlc
field; and there, as well as in Peru, still greater numbers pe-
rilhed under the hardships of attending the Spanish armies in
their various expeditions and civil wars, worn out with the

inceflant
346

incessant toil of carrying their baggage, provisions, and mili-
tary stores.

BUT neither the rage nor cruelty of the Spaniards were so

deftruaive to the people of Mexico and Peru, as the inconfide-
rate policy with which they established their new settlements.
The former were temporary calamities, fatal to individuals;
the latter was a permanent evil, which, with gradual confump-
tion, wafted the nation. When the provinces of Mexico and
Peru were divided among the conquerors, each was eager to
obtain a diflrid, from which he might expec an instantaneous
recompence for all his services. Soldiers accustomed to the
carelessness and dissipation of a military life, had neither indus-
try to carry on any plan of regular cultivation, nor patience to
wait for its flow, but certain returns. Instead of fettling in the
vallies occupied by the natives, where the fertility of the foil
would have amply rewarded the diligence of the planter, they
chose to fix their fiations in some of the mountainous regions,
frequent both in New Spain and in Peru. To search for mines
of gold and silver, was the chief object of their activity. The
vast profpedts which this -opens, and the alluring hopes which
it continually presents, correspond wonderfully with the spirit of
enterprize and adventure that animated the first emigrants to
America in every part of their conduCt. In order to push for-
ward thofc favourite projects, so many hands were wanted, that
the service of the natives became indispensably requisite. They
were, accordingly, compelled to abandon their ancient habita-
tions in the plains, and driven in crowds to the mountains.
This sudden transition from the sultry climate of the vallies, to
the chill penetrating air peculiar to high lands in the torrid
zone; the fatigue of exorbitant labour, scanty or unwholesome

they saw no end, affeced them nearly as much as their less
industrious countrymen in the islands. They funk under the
united preflure of those calamities, and melted away with al-
most equal rapidity z. In consequence of this, together with
the introduction of the small-pox, a malady unknown in Ame-
rica, and extremely fatal to the natives a, the number of people
both in New Spain and Peru was so much reduced, that in a
few years the accounts of their ancient population appeared
almost incredible b

Not the rerult SUCH are the most considerable events and causes, which, by
of any fyfiem
of policy; their combined operation, contributed to depopulate America.

Without attending to these, many authors astonished at the
suddenness of the desolation, have ascribed this unexampled
event to a scheme of policy no less profound than atrocious. The
Spaniards, as they pretend, conscious of their own inability to
occupy the vast regions which they had discovered, and foresee-
ing the impossibility of maintaining their authority over a peo-
ple infinitely superior to themselves in number, in order to
preserve America, resolved to exterminate the inhabitants, and
by converting a great part of the country into a defart, endea-
voured to secure their own dominion over it'. But nations
fcldom extend their views to objets so remote, or lay their
plans so deep ; and, for the honour of humanity, we may ob-
serve, that no nation ever deliberately formed such an execrable

scheme. The Spanish monarchs, far from acting upon any B o 0 K
such fyftcm of deftrudion, were uniformly solicitous for the I---
preservation of their new fubjeEts. With Isabella, zeal for pro-
pagating the christian faith., together with the desire of com-
municating the knowledge of truth, and the consolations of reli-
gion to people deffitute of spiritual light, were more than often-
fible motives for encouraging Columbus to attempt his disco-
veries. Upon his success, she endeavoured to fulfil her pious
purpose, and manifested the most tender concern to secure not
only religious inftrudion, but mild treatment, to that inoffen-
five race of men fubjeEced to her crown d. Her successors adopt-
ed the fame ideas; and, on many occasions, which I have men-
tioned, their authority was interposed in the moil vigorous
exertions, to protet the people of America from the oppref-
sion of their Spanish fubjedts. Their regulations for this pur-
pose were numerous, and often repeated. They were framed
with wisdom, and dictated by humanity. After their posTef-
sions in the New World became so extensive, as might have
excited some apprehensions of difficulty in retaining their do-
minion over them, the spirit of their regulations was as mild
as when their settlements were confined to the islands alone.
Their solicitude to protect the Indians seems rather to have
augmented as their acquisitions increased; and from ardour to
accomplish this, they enacted, and endeavoured to enforce the
execution of laws, which excited a formidable rebellion in one
of their colonies, and fprcad alarm and difitffecion through all
the reft. 3But the avarice of individuals was too violent to be

rent slate, with persevering attention, issued edicts to prevent
the oppression of the Indians; the colonists, regardless of thefc,
or trusting to their distance for impunity, continued to confider,
and treat them as slaves. The governors themselves, and other
officers employed in the colonies, several of whom were as in-
digent and rapacious as the adventurers over whom they prefid-
ed, were too apt to adopt their contemptuous ideas of the con-
quered people; and, instead of checking, encouraged or con-
nived at their excesses. The desolation of the New World
should not then be charged on the court of Spain, or be confiderd
as the effect of any system of policy adopted there. It ought to
be imputed wholly to the conquerors and first planters of Ame-
rica, who, by measures no less inconsiderate than unjust, coun-
teraaed the edias of their sovereign, and have brought disgrace
upon their country.

nor the e- WITH still greater injustice, have many authors represented
fe& of reli-
gion. the intolerating spirit of the Roman Catholic religion, as the

cause of exterminating the Americans, and have accused the
Spanish ecclesiastics of animating their countrymen to the
slaughter of that innocent people, as idolaters and enemies of
God. But the sirs missionaries who visited America, though
weak and illiterate, were pious men. They early cfpoufed the
defence of the natives, and vindicated their character from the
aspersions of their conquerors, who, describing them as inca-
pable of being formed to the offices of civil life, or of compre-
hending the doctrines of religion, contended, that they were

a sub-
350

a subordinate race of men, on whom the hand of nature had
set the mark of servitude. From the accounts which I have
given of the humane and persevering zeal of the Spanish mif-
fionaries, in proteting the helpless flock committed to their
charge, they appear in a light which reflects lustre upon their
function. They were ministers of peace, who endeavoured to
wrest the rod from the hands of oppressors. To their power-
ful interposition, the Americans were indebted for every regu-
lation tending to mitigate the rigour of their fate. The clergy
in the Spanish settlements, regular as well as secular, are fill
confidered by the Indians-as their natural guardians, to whom
they have recourse under the hardships and exactions to which
they are too often exposed ".

BUT,. notwithstanding the rapid depopulation of America, a

very considerable number of the native race still remains both in
Mexico and Peru, especially in those parts which were not ex-
posed to the sirs fury of the Spanish arms, or desolated by the
first efforts of their industry, fill more ruinous. In Guatimala,
Chiapa, Nicaragua, and the other delightful provinces of the
Mexican empire, which firetch along the south-sea, the race of
Indians is till numerous. Their settlements in some places are
so populous, as to merit the name of cities . In the three au-
diences into which New Spain is divided, there arc at least two
millions of Indians; a pitiful remnant, indeed, of its ancient po-
pulation,. but such as fill forms a body of people superior in
number to that of all the other inhabitantsof this vast country g.

and Peru were accustomed to a fixed residence, and to some de-
gree of regular industry, less violence was requisite in bringing
them to some conformity with the European modes of civil life.
But wherever the Spaniards fettled among the savage tribes of
America, their attempts to incorporate with them have been
always fruitless, and often fatal to the natives. Impatient of
restraint, and disdaining labour as a mark of servility, they
either abandoned their original feats, and fought for independ-
ance in mountains and forests inaccessible to their oppressors, or
perished when reduced to a state repugnant to their ancient ideas
and habits. In the difirids adjacent to Carthagena, to Panama,
and to Buenos-Ayres, the desolation is more general than even
in those parts of Mexico and Peru, of which the Spaniards have
taken most full poffeiton.

General ideas BUT the establishments of the Spaniards in the New World,
of the policy though fatal to its ancient inhabitants, were made at a period
of Spain in its
colonies. when that monarchy was capable of forming them to best ad-

vantage. By the union of all its petty kingdoms, Spain was
become a powerful state, equal to so great an undertaking. Its
monarchs, having extended their prerogative far beyond the li-
mits which once circumscribed the regal power in every king-
dom of Europe, were hardly subjet to controwul, either in con-
certing, or in executing their mcafures. In every wide extend-
ed empire, the form of government must be simple, and the so-
vereign authority ablolutc; that its resolutions may be taken
with promptitude, and may pervade the whole with sus-
ficicnt force. Such was the power of the Spanifnl monarchs,

2 wlic

when they were called to deliberate concerning the mode of B 0 0 K
eflablifhing their dominion over the mofl remote provinces, _---
which had ever been fubjeded to any European slate. In this de-
liberation, they felt themselves under no constitutional restraint,
and that, as independent mailers of their own rcfolves, they
might issue the edics requisite for modelling the government of
the new colonies, by a mere at of prerogative.

THIS early interposition of the Spanifl crown, in order to Early inter-

position of the

which distinguishes their progress from that of the colonies of rit.
any other European nation. When the Portuguese, the English,
and French, took poffcffion of the regions in America which
they now occupy, the advantages which these promised to yield
were so remote and uncertain, that their colonies were suffered
to struggle through a hard infancy, almost without guidance or
protedion from the parent slate. But gold and silver, the first
productions of the Spanifi settlements in the New World, were
more alluring, and immediately attracted the attention of their
monarchs. Though they had contributed little to the discovery,
and aimoft nothing to the conquest of the New World, they in-
flantly afliumed the function of its legislators; and having ac-
quired a fpecics of dominion formerly unknown, they formed
a plan for exercising it, to which nothing similar occurs in the
history of hnman affairs.

vinces of each viceroyalty began to improve in industry and popu-
lation. The people complained of their fubjetion to a superior,
whose place of residence was so distant, or so inaccessible, as al-
most excluded them from any intercourse with the feat of govern-
ment. The authority of the viceroy over diflrids so far removed
from his own eye and observation, was unavoidably both feeble
and ill direted. As a remedy for those evils, a third viceroy-
alty has been established in the present century, at Santa Fe de
Bogota, the capital of the new kingdom of Granada, the jurif-
didion of which extends over the whole kingdom of Tierra
Firme, and the province of Quitoh. Those viceroys not only Theirpowera
represent the person of their sovereign, but possess his regal
prerogatives within the precincts of their own governments, in
their utmost extent. Like him, they exercise supreme autho-
rity in every department of government, civil, military, and
criminal. They have the sole right of nominating the persons
who hold many offices of the highest importance, and the occa-
fional privilege of supplying such as are in the royal gift, until
the successor appointed by the king shall arrive. The external
pomp of their government is suited to its real dignity and power.
Their courts are formed upon the model of that at Madrid,
with horse and foot guards, a household regularly eftabliflhed,
numerous attendants, and ensigns of command, displaying
such magnificence, as hardly retains the appearance of delegat-
ed authority'.

formed upon the model of the court of Chancery in Spain.
These are eleven in number, and dispense jultice to as many

is various, according to the extent and importance of their

tive, and is commonly filled by persons of such abilities and
merit, as renders this tribunal extremely refpetable. Both ci-

bold, have aspired at a power which their master does not ven- B O , K
ture to assume. In order to check an usurpation which must -
have annihilated justice and security in the Spanilh colonies, by
subjecting the lives and property of all to the will of a single
man, the viceroys have been prohibited, in the most explicit
terms, by repeated laws, from interfering in the judicial pro-
ceedings of the courts of Audience, or from delivering an opi-
nion, or giving a voice with refpea to any point litigated be-
fore them '. In some particular cafes, in which any question
of civil right is involved, even the political regulations of the
viceroy may be brought under the review of the court of Au-
dience, which, in those instances, may be deemed an interme-
diate power placed between him and the people, as a conftitu-
tional barrier to circumscribe his jurifdicion. But as legal restraints
on a person who represents the sovereign, and is cloathed with
his authority, are little suited to the genius of Spanish policy;
the hesitation and reserve with which it confers this power on
the courts of Audience, are remarkable. They may advise,
they may remonstrate, but in the event of a direa collision be-
tween their opinion and the will of the viceroy, what he deter-
mines muff be carried into execution, and nothing remains for
them, but to lay the matter before the king and the council of
the Indies'n. But to be intitled to remonstrate, and inform
against a person, before whom all others must be silent, and
tamely submit to his decrees, is a privilege which adds dignity to
the courts of Audience. This is farther augmented by another
circumstance. Upon the death of a viceroy, without any provi-
sion of a succesSor by the king, the filpreme power is veiled in

SUCII is the great outline of that system of government,

which Spain has established in her American colonies. To enu-
nmerate the various subordinate boards and officers employed in
the administration of justice, in collecting the public revenue,
and in regulating the interior police of the country, to describe
their different functions, and to inquire into the mode and
effec of their operations, would prove a detail no less intricate
than minute and uninteresting.

prohibition of any intercourse with foreign nations. They took
possession of America by right of conquest, and conscious not
only of the feebleness of their infant settlements, but aware of
the difficulty in establishing their dominion over such vast regi-
ons, or in retaining so many reluctant nations under the yoke,
they dreaded the intrusion of firangers; they even shunned their
infpecion, and endeavoured to keep them at a ditfance from their
coasts. This spirit of jealousy and exclusion, which at first was
natural, and perhaps necessary, augmented as their poflfilions
in America extended, and the value of them came to be more
fully understood. In consequence of it, a system of colonizing
was introduced, to which there had hitherto been nothing fimi-
lar among mankind. In the ancient world, it was not uncom-
mon to fend forth colonies. But they were of two kinds only.
They were either migrations, which servcd to diSburden a late

of its superfluous fubjeas, when they multiplied too falf for B o00 K
the territory which they occupied: or they were military de-
tachments stationed, as garrisons, in a conquered province. The
colonies of some Greek republics, and the swarms of northern
barbarians which fettled in different parts of Europe, were of
the first species. The Roman colonies were of the second. In
the former, the connetion with the mother-country quickly
ceased, and they became independent states. In the latter, as
the disjuncion was not complete, the dependence continued. In Regulations
their American settlements, the Spaniih monarchs took what was for that pur-
peculiar to each, and fludied to unite them. By fending colonies
to regions so remote, by establishing in each a form of interior
policy and administration, under diftina governors, and with
peculiar laws, they disjoined them from the mother-country.
By retaining in their own hands the rights of legislation, as
well as that of imposing taxes, together with the power of no-
minating the persons who filled every department, civil or mili-
tary, they secured their dependence. Happily for Spain, the
situation of her colonies was such, as rendered it possible to
reduce this new idea into praaice. Almost all the countries
which she had discovered and occupied, lay within the tropics.
The producions of Chat large portion of the globe, are different
from those of Europe, even in its most southern provinces. The
qualities of the climate and of the foil naturally turn the in-
duftry of such as fettle there into new channels. When the
Spaniards first took possession of their domains in America, the
precious metals which they yielded, were the only object that
attraced their attention. Even when their efforts began to take
a better direction, they employed themselves almost wholly in
rearing such peculiar productions of the climate, as, from their
rarity or value, were of chief demand in the mother-country.

B 0 O K Allured by vast profpeds of immediate wealth, they disdained

, to waste their industry on what was leTs lucrative, but of fupe-

rior moment. In order to render it impoflible to correC this
error, and to prevent them from making any efforts which might
interfere with those of Spain, the eflablifhment of several species
of manufaCtures, and even the culture of the vine, or olive,
are prohibited in the colonies', under severe penalties'. They
hnuft trust entirely to the mother-country for the objects of pri-
miary neceflity. Their clothes, their furniture, their inftru-
ments of labour, their luxuries, and even a considerable part of
the provisions which they consume, were imported from Spain.
During a great part of the sixteenth century, Spain poffefling
an extensive commerce and flourishing manufactures, could
supply with ease the growing demands of her colonies, from
her own stores. The produce of their mines and plantations
was given in exchange for these. But all that the colonies re-
ceived, as well as all that they gave, was conveyed in Spanish
bottoms. No vessel belonging to the colonies was ever per-
mitted to carry the commodities of America to Europe. Even
the commercial intercourse of one colony with another, was
either absolutely prohibited, or limited by many jealous refiric-
tions. All that America yields flows into the ports of Spain;
all that it consumes miuft issue from them. No foreigner can
enter its colonies without express permission; no vessel of
any foreign nation is received into their harbours; and the
pains of death, with confiscation of moveables, are denounced
againfl every inhabitant who presumes to trade with them".
Thus the colonies are kept in a slate of perpetual pupillage;

had defiroyed; and, from many concurring causes, their pro-
grefs was extremely flow, in filling up the immense void which
their devaflations had occasioned. As soon as the rage for disco-
very and adventure began to abate, the Spaniards opened their
eyes to dangers and distresses, which at firfl they did not per-
ceive, or had despised. The numerous hardships with which
the members of infant colonies have to firuggle, the diseases of
unwholesome climates, fatal to the conflitution of Europeans;
the difficulty of bringing a country, covered with forefis, into
culture; the want of hands necessary for labour in some pro-
vinces, and the flow reward of industry in all, unless where the
accidental discovery of mines enriched a few fortunate adven-
turers, were evils universally felt and magnified. Discouraged
by the view of these, the spirit of migration was so much damp-
ed, that sixty years after the discovery of the New World, the
number of Spaniards in all its provinces is computed not to have
exceeded fifteen thousand'.

pid increase of people in any new settlement, property in land
ought to be divided into small shares, and the alienation of it
should be rendered extremely easy Y. But the rapaciousness of
the Spanish conquerors of the New World paid no regard to
this fundamental maxim of policy; and, as they possessed power,
which enabled them to gratify the utmost extravagance of their
wishes, many seized diftriEts and provinces of vail extent, and
held them as encomiendas. By degrees they obtained the pri-
vilege of converting a part of these into Mayorafgos, a fpe-
cies of fief, introduced into the Spanish fyflem of feudal jurif-
prudence', which can neither be divided nor alienated. Thus
a great portion of landed property, under this rigid form of
entail, is withheld from circulation, and descends from father
to son unimproved, and of little value either to the proprietor
or to the community. In the account which I have given
of the reduction of Peru, various examples occur of enormous
traas of country occupied by some of the conquerors a. The
excesses in other provinces were similar, for as the value of the
lands which they acquired, was originally estimated according
to the number of Indians which lived upon them, America was
in general so thinly peopled, that only diilrists of great extent
could afford such a number of labourers, as might be employed
in the mines with any prospect of considerable gain. The per-
nicious effects of those radical errors in the distribution and
nature of property in the Spanish settlements, are felt through
every department of industry, and may be confidered as one

a heavy tax on industry; and if the exaction of them be not
regulated and circumscribed by the wisdom of the civil magi-
firate, it becomes intolerable and ruinous. But, instead of any
refiraint on the claims of ecclefiaflics, the inconsiderate zeal of
the Spanish legislators admitted them into America in their full
extent, and at once imposed on their infant colonies a burden
which is in no flight degree oppressive to society even in its
most improved slate. As early as the year i5oi, the payment
of tythes in the colonies was enjoined, and the mode of it re-
gulated by law. Every article of primary necessity, towards
which the attention of new settlers must naturally be turned, is
fubjeded to that grievous exaction '. Nor were the demands of
the clergy confined to articles of simple culture. Its more artificial
and operose produtions; such as sugar, indigo, and cochineal,
were soon declared to be tythable d; and thus the industry of the
planter was taxed in every stage of its progress, from its rudest

or Mahometan blood, and never disgraced by any censure of the

lodged, and almost every public funEion, from the viceroyalty
downwards, is committed to them alone. Every person, who
by his birth, or residence in America, may be fufpeded of any
attachment or interest adverse to the mother-country, is the ob-
jeat of dirtruft to such a degree, as amounts nearly to an exclu-
lion from all offices of confidence or authority '. By this con-

such pre-eminence in America, that they look down with disdain
on every other order of men.

of their minds is so entirely broken, that a great part of them
waste life in luxurious indulgencies, mingled with an illiberal
superstition still more debating. Languid and unenterprifing,
the operations of an ative extended commerce would be to
them so cumbersome and oppressive, that in almost every part of
America they decline engaging in it. The interior traffic of
every colony, as well as its trade with the neighbouring provin-

latter MeJtizos. As the court of Spain, solicitous to incorporate
its new vassals with its ancient fubjeas, early encouraged the
Spaniards fettled in America to marry the natives of that country,
several alliances of this kind were formed in their infant colonies'.
But it has been more owing to licentious indulgence, than to
compliance with this injuncion of their Sovereigns, that this
mixed breed has multiplied so greatly, as to constitute a confider-

several flages of descent in this race, and the gradual variations

here they are mentioned chiefly, in order to point out a peculia-
rity in their situation under the Spanish dominion. In several
of their settlements, particularly in New Spain, negroes are
chiefly employed in domeffic service. They form a principal
part in the train of luxury, and are cherished and caressed
by their superiors, to whose vanity and pleasures they are equal-

whose paflions they imbibe". Elevated by this diftindion, they

them with such insolence and scorn, that the antipathy between
the two races has become implacable. Even in Peru, where ne-
groes are more numerous, and employed in field-work as well as

of the society, which had adopted them as members. But as B o K
no considerable benefit could be expected from the voluntary -,-
efforts of men, unacquainted with regular industry, and averse
to labour, the court of Spain found it necessary to fix and fe-
cure, by proper regulations, what it thought reasonable to exaa
from them. With this view, an annual tax was imposed up- Taximpored
on every male, from the age of eighteen to fifty; and, at the on them.
fame time, the nature as well as extent of the services which
they might be required to perform, were ascertained with pre-
cifion. This tribute varies in different provinces, but if we
take that paid in New Spain as a medium, its annual amount
is nearly four ihillings a head, no exorbitant fum in countries
where, as at the source of wealth, the value of money is ex-
tremely low0. The right of levying it likewise varies. In
America, every Indian is either an immediate vassal of the
crown, or depends upon some fubje& to whom the diftria, in
which he resides, has been granted for a limited time, under
the denomination of an encomienda. In the former cafe, about
three-fourths of the tax is paid into the royal treasury; in the
latter, the fame proportion of it belongs to the holder of
the grant. When Spain first took poffeflion of America,
the greater part of it was parcelled out among its conquerors,
or those who first fettled there, and but a small portion referv-
ed for the crown. As those grants which were made for two
lives onlyP, reverted successively to the sovereign, he had it in
his power either to diffuef his favours by grants to new pro-

services, however, which can now be legally exacted, are very
different from the servile talks originally imposed upon the In-
dians. The nature of the work which they murl perform is
defined, and an equitable recompence is granted for their la-
bour. The tlated services demanded of the Indians, may be
divided into two branches. They are either employed in works

of refining it by successive processes, no less unwholesome than B O O K
operose'.

THE mode of exating both these services is the fame, and is The mode

under regulations framed with a view of rendering it as little of exaSting
oppressive as possible to the Indians. They are called out al-
ternately in divisions, termed Mitas, and no person can be
compelled to go but in his turn. In Peru, the number called
out muff not exceed the seventh part of the inhabitants in any
diftritu. In New Spain, where the Indians are more nume-
rous, it is fixed at four in the hundred". During what time
the labour of those Indians, who are employed in agriculture,
continues, I have not been able to learn'. But in Peru, each
Mita, or division, deffined for the mines, remains there fix
months; and while engaged in this service, a labourer never
receives less than two Shillings a day, and often earns more than
double that fumz. No Indian, residing at a greater distance
than thirty miles from a mine, is included in the Mita, or divi-
sion employed in working it"; nor are the inhabitants of the
low country exposed to certain defirudion, by compelling them
to remove from that warm climate, to the cold elevated regions
where minerals abound".

THE Indians who live in the principal towns, are entirely How govern-

subjed to the Spanish laws and magiflrates; but in their own ed.
villages, they are governed by Caziques, tome of whom are the
descendants of their ancient lords, others are named by the

jurifdlition, lodged in such friendly hands, affords some confola-
tion; and so little formidable is this dignity to their new masters,
that they often allow it to descend by hereditary right'. For the
farther relief of men so much exposed to oppression, the Spanish
court has appointed an officer in every diftria, with the title of
Protedcor of the Indians. It is his function, as the name implies,
to afflrt the rights of the Indians, to appear as their defender in
the courts ofjuftice; and, by the interposition of his authority, to
set bounds to the encroachments and exations of his country-
men'. A certain portion of the reserved fourth of the annual
tribute, is destined for the salary of the caziques and protecors,
another is applied to the maintenance of the clergy employed in
the initrution of the Indians'. Another part seems to be appro-
priated for the benefit of the Indians themselves, and is applied
for the payment of their tribute in years of famine, or when a par-
ticular difirid is affeed by any extraordinary calamity . Betides
this, provision is made by various laws, that hospitals shall be
founded in every new settlement for the reception of Indianss.
Such hospitals have accordingly been erected, both for the indi-
gent and infirm, in Lima, in Cuzco, and in Mexico, where the
Indians are treated with tenderness and humanity '.

SUCH are the leading principles in the jurisprudence and policy

by which the Indians are now governed in the provinces be-

Ibnging to Spain. In those regulations of the Spanish mo- B 0 1 K
narchs, we discover no traces of that cruel system of externina- -
tion, which they have been charged with adopting; and if we
admit, that the necessity of securing subsistence for their colo-
nies, or the advantages derived from working the mines, give
them a right to avail themselves of the labour of the Indians,
we must allow, that the attention with which they regulate and
recompence that labour, is provident and sagacious. In no code
of laws is greater solicitude displayed, or precautions multiplied
with more concern for the preservation, the security, and the
happiness of the fubje&, than we discover in the collection of
the Spanish laws for the Indies. But those later regulations,.
like the more early ediEts which have been already mentioned,
have too often proved ineffectual remedies againlt the evils
which they were intended to prevent. In every age, if the fame
causes continue to operate, the fame effects muff follow. From
the immense distance between the power entrusted with the
execution of laws; and that, by whose authority they are
enacted, the vigour even of the mofl absolute government must
relax, and the dread of a. superior too remote to obfervc with
accuracy, or to punish with dispatch, muff insensibly abate.
Notwithflanding the numerous injunctions of the Spanifl Ino-
narchs, the Indians still susser, on many occasions, both fiom.
the avarice of individuals, and from the exacions of the ma-
giftrates, who ought to have protected them; unreasonable
talks are imposed; the term of their labour is prolonged, and
they groan under all the insults and wrongs which are the lot
of a dependent people'. From tome information on which
I can depend, such oppression abounds more in Pcru, than
in any other colony. But it is not general. Accord-

disposed to exaggerate the sufferings of the Indians, they, in
several provinces, enjoy not only ease, but affluence; they pof-
fess large farms; they are masters of numerous herds and
flocks; and, by the knowledge which they have acquired of
European arts and industry, are supplied not only with the ne-
ceffaries, but with many luxuries of lifek.

lccefarnical AFTER explaining the form of civil government inthe Spanifl
conliitution
of the colo- colonies, and the state of the various orders of persons subjec
nlies. to it, the peculiarities in their ecclesiastical constitution merit

consideration. Notwithstanding the superstitious veneration
with which the Spaniards are devoted to the Holy See, the vi-
gilant and jealous policy of Ferdinand early prompted him to
take precautions against the introduction of the papal dominion

Retaint onj into America. With this view, he solicited Alexander VI. for
the papal ju-
rifdicion. a grant of the tythes in all the newly-difcovered countries',

which he obtained on condition of his making provision
for the religious instruction of the natives. Soon as-
ter, Julius II. conferred on him the right of patronage,
and absolute disposal of all ecclesiastical benefices there". Both
these pontiffs, unacquainted with the value of what he demand-
ed, bcftowed those donations with an inconsiderate liberality,
which their successors have often lamented, and wished to recal.
In consequence of those grants, the Spanish monarchs have be-
come, in effce, the heads of the American .church. In them
the adminiiration of its revenues is vested. Their nomination
of persons to supply vacant benefices is instantly confirmed by

the pope. Thus, in all Spanish America, authority of every B 0 O IK
species centres in the crown. There no collision is known be- -
tween spiritual and temporal jurifdidion. The king is the on-
ly superior, his name alone is heard, and no dependence upon
any foreign power has been introduced. Papal bulls can-
not be admitted into America, nor are they of any force there,
until they have been previously examined, and approved of by
the royal council of the Indies "; and if any bull should be fur-
repitioufly introduced, and circulated in America without ob-
taining that approbation, ecclesiastics are required not only to
prevent it from taking effect, but to seize all the copies of it,
and transmit them to the council of the Indies . To this limi-
tation of the papal jurifdiaion, equally singular whether we
confider the age and nation in which it was devised, or the jea-
lous attention with which Ferdinand, and his fucceflbrs, have
studied to maintain it in full force P, Spain is indebted, in a great
measure, for the uniform tranquillity which has reigned in her
American dominions.

THE hierarchy is established in America in the fame form as Form and en-

dowments of

in Spain, with its full train of archbilhops, biflops, deans, and the church in
other dignitaries. The inferior clergy are divided into three thc Spanisl
classes, under the denomination of Curas, Doctr-ineros, and
MiJoneros. The first are parifl-priefts in those parts of the
country where the Spaniards have fettled. The second have
the charge of such diftrias as are inhabited by Indians sub-
jeaed to the Spanish government, and living under its protec-
tion. The third are employed in converting and inltructing

those fiercer tribes, which disdain submission to the Spanish
yoke, and live in remote or inaccessible regions, to which the
Spanish arms have not penetrated. So numerous are the eccle-
flaftics of all those various orders, and such the profuse liberali-
ty with which many of them are endowed, that the revenues of
the church in America are immense. The superstition of Rome
appears with its utmost pomp in the New World. Churches
and convents there are magnificent and richly adorned; and on
high festivals, the display of gold and silver, and precious stones,
is such as exceeds the conception of an Europeanq. An eccle-
fiaftical establishment so splendid and expensive, is unfavourable,
as has been formerly observed, to the progress of rising colo-
nies; but in countries where riches abound, and the people are
so delighted with parade, that religion must assume it, in order
to attraEc their veneration, this propensity to ostentation has
been indulged, and becomes less pernicious.

THE early institution of monasteries in the Spanish colonies,

and the inconsiderate zeal in multiplying them, have been at-
tended with consequences more fatal. In every new settlement,
the first objeEt is to encourage population, and to incite every
citizen to contribute towards augmenting the strength and num-
ber of the community. During the youth and vigour of so-
ciety, while there is room to spread, and sustenance is procur-
ed with facility, mankind increase with amazing rapidity. But
the Spaniards had hardly taken possession o- America, when,
with a most preposterous policy, they began to erect convents
where persons of both sexes were fllut up, under a vow to de-
feat the purpose of nature, and to counteraa the firit of her

of that listless ease, which, in sultry climates, is deemed fu-
preme felicity, numbers crowd into those mansions of sloth and
fuperffition, and are loft to society. As none but persons of
Spanish extract are admitted into the monasteries of the New
World, the evil is more sensibly felt, and every monk or nun,
may be confidered as an acive person withdrawn from civil
life. The impropriety of such foundations in any situation
where the extent of territory requires additional hands to im-
prove it, is so obvious, that some catholic fRates have expressly
prohibited any person in their colonies from taking the monastic
vows' Even the Spanish monarchs, on some occasions, seem
to have been alarmed with the spreading of a spirit so adverse to
the increase and prosperity of their colonies, that they have en-
deavoured to check its. But the Spaniards in America, more
thoroughly under the influence of fiuperftition than their coun-
trymen in Europe, and directed by ecclesiastics more bigotted
and illiterate, have conceived such an high opinion of monastic
sanctity, that no regulations can refirain their zeal; and, by
the excess of their ill-judged bounty, religious houses have
multiplied to a degree no less amazing than pernicious to
society '.

t---- retirement and indolence of academic life, are more incapable

of a-tive enterprize, and less disposed to strike into new paths,
than any order of men, the ecclesiastical adventurers by whom
the American church is recruited, are commonly such as, from
merit or rank in life, have little profpedt of success in their

ofthfeecu- own country. Accordingly, the secular priests in the New
lais; *World are still less distinguished than their brethren in Spain,

for literary accomplifl.nents of any species; and though, by
the ample provision which has been made for the American
church, many of its members enjoy the ease and independence,
which are favourable to the cultivation of science; the body of
secular clergy has hardly, during two centuries and a half, pro-
duced one author whose works convey such useful information,
or possess such a degree of merit, as to be ranked among those
which attract the attention of enlightened nations. But the
of the regu- greatest part of the ecclesiastics in the Spanish settlements are re-

Lrs, gulars. On the discovery of America, a new field opened to the

pious zeal of the monastic orders;, and, with a becoming ala-
crity, they immediately sent forth missionaries to labour in
it. The first attempt to inftruC and convert the Americans,
was made by monks; and, as soon as the conquest of any pro-
vince was completed, and its ccclefiaftical eftabliflment began to
aflume some form, the popes permitted the missionaries of the
four mendicant orders, as a reward for their services, to accept
of parochial charges in America, to perform all spiritual func-
tions, and to receive the tythes, and other emoluments of the
benefice, without depending on the jurifdidion of the bishop of
the diocefl', or being fubjeca to his cenfurcs. In conlequencc of
this, a new career of usefulness, as well as new objeds of am-
bition prcfentcd themselves. Whcncver a call is made fora fricfl

minds, impatient under the restraint of a cloister, weary of its ,--_
insipid uniformity, and fatigued with the irksome repetition of
its frivolous funtions, offer their service with eagerness, and re-
pair to the New World in quefl of liberty and diftintion. Nor
do they pursue diftintion without success. The higllef ecclefi-
aftical honours, as well as the motl lucrative preferments in
Mexico and Peru, are often in the hands of regulars; and it is
chiefly to the monastic orders that the Americans are indebted
for any portion of science which is cultivated among them.
They are almost the only Spanish ecclesiastics, from whom we
have received any accounts either of the civil or natural history
of the various provinces in America. Some of them, though
deeply tinged with the indelible fuperflition of their profeflion,
have published books which give a favourable idea of their abili-
ties. The natural and moral history of the New World, by the
Jesuit Acofta, contains more accurate observations, perhaps, and
more found science, than are to be found in any description of
remote countries published in the sixteenth century.

with others of a very different character. The giddy, the pro-

B 0 0 K they are hardly subj et to any controul. According to the teftimo-
-_v--.._ ny of the most zealous catholics, many of the regular clergy in

the Spanish settlements, are not only destitute of the virtues be-
coming their profession, but regardless of that external decorum
and refpea for the opinion of mankind, which preserve a fem-
blance of worth, where the reality is wanting. Secure of impu-
nity, some regulars, in contempt of their vow of poverty, engage
openly in commerce; and are so rapaciously eager in amassing
wealth, that they become the most grievous oppressors of the
Indians, whom it was their duty to have protected. Others,
with no less flagrant violation of their vow of chaflity, indulge
with little disguise in the most dissolute licentiousness "

. VARIOUS schemes have been proposed for redressing enormi-

ties so manifest and offensive. Several persons, no less emi-
nent for piety than discernment, have contended, that the re-
gulars, in conformity to the canons of the church, ought to be
confined within the walls of their cloisters, and should no
longer be permitted to encroach on the funcions of the fecu-
lar clergy. Some public-fpirited magistrates, from conviction
of its being necessary to deprive the regulars of a privilege, be-
flowed at first with good intention, but of which time and ex-
perience had discovered the pernicious effecs, openly coun-
tenanced the secular clergy in their attempts to assert their own
i6iS. rights. The prince D'Efquilache, viceroy of Peru under

Philip III. took measures so decisive and effeclual for circum-
scribing the regulars within their proper sphere, as firuck them

arts. They alarmed the superstitious, by representing the pro- B o 0:
ceedings of the viceroy as innovations fatal to religion. They .--- »
employed all the refinements of intrigue, in order to gain per-
sons in power; and seconded by the powerful influence of the
Jesuits, who claimed and enjoyed all the privileges which be-
longed to the Mendicant orders in America, they made a deep
imprefion on a bigotted prince, and a weak ministry. The
ancient praaice was tolerated. The abuses which it occasioned
continued to increase, and the corruption of monks, exempt
from the refiraints of discipline, and the infpeLtion of any
superior, became a disgrace to religion. At last, as the vene-
ration of the Spaniards for the monastic orders began to abate,
and the power of the Jesuits was on the decline, Ferdinand VI.
ventured to apply the only effeEtual remedy, by issuing an June 23,
edit, prohibiting Regulars of every denomination from taking '757.
the charge of any parish with the cure of fouls; and declaring,
that on the demise of the present incumbents, none but secular
priests, subjea to the jurifdidion of their diocesans, Illall be
presented to vacant benefices z. If this regulation is carried into
execution with fleadinefs, in any degree proportional to the
wisdom with which it is framed, a very considerable reforma-
tion may take place in the ecclesiastical tfate of Spanifi America,
and the secular clergy may gradually become a refpedable body
of men. The deportment of many ecclesiastics, even at pecfent
ieems to be decent and exemplary, otherwise we can hardly sup-
pose that they would be held in ifch high eflimation, and piffcfs
such a wonderful aceendant over the minds of their coullntymncn
throughout all the Spanifl fcttleinents.

fsmlil con- knowledge of true religion to the Indians, has been more im-

verting the perfed than might have been expeEted, either from the degree
Indians to
Chrittianity. of their zeal, or from the dominion which they had acquired

,over that people. For this various reasons may be assigned.
The first mifflonaries, in their ardour to make proselytes, ad-
mitted the people of America into the christian church, without
previous inftrution in the docrines of religion, and even before
they themselves. had acquired such knowledge of the Indian lan-
guage, as to: be able to explain to the natives the mysteries of
faith, or the precepts of duty. Refting upon a subtle diftinc-
tion. in fcholaRiic theology, they adopted this firange pracice,
o. less inconsistent with the spirit of a religion, which addresses
itself to the understanding of men, than repugnant to the dic-
tates of reason. As soon as any body of people, overawed by
dread of the Spanifl power, moved by the example of their
own chiefs, incited by levity, or yielding from mere ignorance,
expressed the slightest desire of embracing the religion of their
conquerors, they were inflantly baptized. While this rage of
conversion continued, a single clergyman baptized in one day
above five thousand Mexicans, and did not defifft until he was
so exhaufced by fatigue, that he was unable to lift his hands .
In the course of a few years, after the reduction of the Mexican
empire, the sacrament of baptifin was adminiflered to more
than four millions '. Proselytes adopted with such inconsiderate
haste, and who were neither inftruated in the nature of the
tenets, to which it was supposed they had given assent, nor

taught the absurdity of those which they were required to re- B o o K
linquifli, retained their veneration for their ancient fuperfti- '_-----,
tions in full force, or mingled an attachment to its doEtrines and
rites, with that slender knowledge of Christianity which they
acquired. These sentiments the new converts tranfinitted to
their posterity, into whose minds they have funk so deep, that
the Spanifli ecclesiastics, with all their industry, have not been
able to eradicate them. The religious inffitutions of their an-
ceftors are still remembered, and held in honour by the Indians,
both in Mexico and Peru; and whenever they think themselves
out of reach of infpeaion by the Spaniards, they aflemble and
celebrate their idolatrous rites .

BUT this is not the most unsurmountable obflacle to the pro-

grefs of Christianity among the Indians. The powers of their
uncultivated understandings are so limited, their observations
and reflections reach so little beyond the mere objects of fcnfe,
that they seem hardly to have the capacity of forming abstract
ideas, and possess not language to express them. To such men,
the sublime and spiritual doctrines of Chriflianity must be in-
comprehensible. The numerous and fpllcndidi ceremonies of
popish worship catch the eye, please and intcrcft them; but
when their instructors attempt to explain the articles of faith,
with which those external observances are connected, though
the Indians may liften with patience, they so little conceive the
meaning of what they hear, that their acquicfcence does not
merit the name of belief. Their indifference is flill greater
than their incapacity. Attentive only to the prefcnt moment,

r----- that neither the promises, nor threats of religion, make much

impression upon them; and while their foresight rarely ex-
tends so far as the next day, it is almost impossible to inspire
them with solicitude about the concerns of a future world.
Aftonifled equally at their slowness of comprehension, and at
their insensibility, som.e of the early missionaries pronounced
them a race of men so brutish, as to be incapable of underfrand-
ing the first principles of religion. A council held at Lima
decreed, that, on account of this incapacity, they ought
to be excluded from the sacrament of the Eucharist . And
though Paul III. by his famous bull, issued in the year 1537,
dleclared them to be rational creatures, entitled to all the privi-
leges of christians '; yet, after the lapse of two centuries, dur-
ing which they have been members of the church, so imperfect
are their attainments in knowledge, that very few possess such
a portion of spiritual discernment, as to be deemed worthy of
being admitted to the holy communion . From this idea of
their incapacity and imperfec knowledge of religion, when the
zeal of Philip II. eftablifled the inquisition in America in the
year I570, the Indians were exempted from the jurifdition of
that severe tribunal , and flill continue under the infpe~&ion of
their diocesans. Even after the most perfect inf-ruElion, their
faith is held to be feeble and dubious ; and though some of them
have been taught the learned languages, andAave gone through
the ordinary course of academic education with applause, their
frailty is still so much fufpeded, that no Indian is either or-
dained a priest, or received into any religious order ".

terior fiate of the Spanifl colonies. The various productions V

Produssions

with which they supply and enrich the mother-country, and oftheSpanisl.
the system of commercial intercourse between them, come next colonies.
in order to be explained. If the dominions of Spain in the
New World had been of such moderate extent, as bore any pro-
portion to the parent state, the progress of her colonizing might
have been attended with the fame benefit as that of other na-
tions. But when, in less than half a century, her inconliderate
rapacity had seized on countries larger than all Europe, her in-
ability to fill such vast regions, with a number of inhabitants
sufficient for the cultivation of them, was so obvious, as to give
a wrong direction to all the efforts of the colonifls. They did
not form compact settlements, where induitry, circumscribed
within proper limits, both in its views and operations, is con-
ducted with that fober perfevcring spirit, which gradually con-
verts whatever is in its poffeflion to a proper use, and dcrives
thence the greatest advantage. Inflead of this, the Spaniards,
reduced by the boundless profpet which opened to them, divid-
ed their pofleffions in America into governments of val- extent.
As their number was too fhiall to attempt the regular culture of
the immense provinces, which they occupied rithller tlan
peopled, they bent their attention to a few ol)jcL's, that alltured
them with hopes of sudden and exorbitant gain, amn tuirnldc
away with contempt fron the humbler patlis of indlufi-v, w'hich

crease of national flrcngth.

- ' must be carried on, or so enterprising and rapacious, as not tobe

satisfied wvith the gradual returns of profit which they yield.
Accordingly, as soon as the several countries in America were
fubjeted to the dominion of Spain, this was almost the only
method of acquiring wealth which occurred to the adventurers,
by whom they were conquered. Such provinces of the con-
tinent as did not allure them to fettle, by the profpeac of their
affording gold and silver, were totally neglected. Those in
which they met with a disappointment of the sanguine expecta-
tions they had formed, were abandoned. Even the value of
the islands, the first-fruits of their discoveries, and the first ob-
jea of their attention, funk so much in their estimation, when
-the mines which had been opened in them were exhausted, that
they were deserted by many of the planters, and left to be oc-
cupied by more industrious possessors. All crowded to Mexico
and Peru, where the vail quantities of gold and silver found
among the natives, who searched for them with little industry
and less skill, promised an unexhaufled store, as the recompence
of more intelligent and persevering efforts,

tain, in pursuit of a Llama which had straycd from his flock.
Soon after the mines of Sacotecas, in New Spain, little inferior to
the other in value, were opened. From that time, successive dif-

so numerous, that the working of them, and of some few mines
of gold in the provinces of Tierra Iirmr, and the new kingdom
of Granada, has become the capital occupation of the Spa-
niards, and is reduced into a system no less complicated than in-
teresting. To describe the nature of the various ores, the mode
of extraaing them from the bowels of the earth, and to explain
the several processes by which the metals are fcparated from the
fubflances with which they are mingled, either by the adcion of
fire, or the attractive powers of mercury, is the province of
the natural philosopher or chymitl, rather than of the his-
torian.

THE exuberant profusion with which the mountains of the

New World poured forth their treasures, astonished mankind,
accustomed hitherto to receive a penurious supply of the preci-
ous metals, from the more scanty flores contained in tile mines
of the ancient hemisphere. According to principles of compu-
tation, which appear to be extremely moderate, the quantity of
gold and silver that has been regularly entered in tile ports of
Spain, is equal in value to four millions flerling annlually,
reckoning from the year 1492, in which America was difio-
vered, to the prcfcnt time. This, in two hundred and eighty-
three years, amounts to eleven hundred and thirty-two millions.
Immense as this urnm is, tlhe Spanilh writers contend, that as
much more ought to be added to it, in consideration of the trca-
sure which has been extraded from the mines, witihout paying
duty to the king. By this account, Spain has drawn fiom the
New World a supply of wealth, amounting at leafi to two thou--
sand millions of pounds flcrling ".

.a certain extent of land is measured off, and a certain number
of Indians allotted him, under the obligation of his opening
the mine within a limited time, and of his paying the cuflc-
nmary duty to the king, for what it shall produce. Invited by
the facility with which such grants are obtained, and encou-
raged by some striking examples of success in this line of ad-

like tle rage for deep play, are so bewitching, and take such full
potTefron of the mind, as even to give a new bent to the na-
tural temper. Under its influence, the cautious become entcr-

formed; a small fum is advanced by each co-partner; the '--"--
mine is opened; the fearciher is entrusted with the sole direc-
tion of every operation; unforeseen difficulties occur; new
demands of money are made; but amidst a succession of dif-
appointments and delays, hope is never extinguished, and the
ardour of expectation hardly abates. For it is observed, that
if any person once enter this seducing path, it is almost impof-
fible to return; his ideas alter, he seems to be poffefled with
another spirit, visions of imaginary wealth are continually be-

power and ingenuity of the Icgiflature would have been exerted

" which all men have in their own good fortune, that wherever
'' there is the least probability of success, too great a share of it

colonies, government is fludious to cherish a spirit which it
Thould have laboured to depress, and by the fandion of its ap-
probation augments that inconsiderate credulity, which has
turned the aaive industry of Mexico and Peru into such an
improper channel. To this may be imputed the slender progress
which Spanish America has made during two centuries, and
a half, either in useful manufactures, or in those lucrative
branches of cultivation, which furnish the colonies of other
nations with their staple commodities. In comparison with the
precious metals, every bounty of nature is so much despised,
that this extravagant idea of their value has mingled with the
idiom of the language in America, and the Spaniards fettled
there denominate a country, rich, not from the fertility of its
foil, the abundance of its crops, or the exuberance of its pas-
tures, hut on account of the minerals which its mountains con-
tain. In quest of these, they abandon the delightful plains
of Peru and Mexico, and retort to barren and uncomfortable
regions, where they have built some of the largest towns which
they possess in the New World. As the acaivity and enterprise
of x\h Spaniards originally took this direcion, it is now so
difficult to bend them a diffcrent way, 'hat although, fiom
various caufcs, the gain of working mines is much decreascd;
the fascination continues, and almost every person, who takes
any active part in the commerce of New Spain or Peru, is flill
engaged in fomc adventure of this kind".

Cochineal is a producion almost peculiar to New Spain, of such
demand in commerce, that the sale is always certain, and it yields
such profit, as amply rewards the labour and care employed in
rearing the curious insets of which this valuable drug is comnpoed,
and preparing it for the market. Quinquina, or Jesuits Bark, the
moit salutary firnple, perhaps, and of most restorative virtue, that
Providence, in compafnon for human infirmity, has made known
unto man, is found only in Peru, to which it affords a lucra-
tive branch of commerce". The indigo of Guatimala is fupe-
rior in quality to that of any province in America, and culti-
vated to a considerable extent. Cacoa, though not peculiar to
the Spanish colonies, attains to its highest slate of perfection
there, and from the great consumption of chocolate in Europe,
as well as in America, is a valuable commodity. The tobacco
of Cuba, of more exquisite flavour than any brought from the
New World; the sugar raised in that island, in Hispaniola,
and in New Spain; together with drugs of various kinds,
may be mentioned among the natural producions of America,
which enrich the Spanish commerce. To there mutt be added
an article of no inconsiderable account, the exportation of
hides; for which, as well as for many of those which I have
enumerated, the Spaniards are more indebted to the wonder-
ful fertility of the country than to their own foresight and
induflry. The domeflic animals of Europe, particularly

B o0 o horned cattle, have multiplied in the New World with a rapi-

----' dity which almoftexceeds belief. A few years after the Spaniards

fettled there, the herds of tame cattle became so numerous, that
their proprietors reckoned them by thousands °. Less attention
being paid to them, as they continued to increase, they were
suffered to run wild, and spreading over a country of boundless
extent, under a mild climate, and covered with rich paflure,
their number became immense. They range over the vast
plains which extend from Buenos Ayres, towards the Andes,
in herds of thirty or forty thousand; and the unlucky tra-
veller who once falls in among them, may proceed several days
before he can disentangle himself from among the crowd that
covers the face of the earth, and seems to have no end. They
are hardly less numerous in New Spain, and in several other
provinces: these are killed merely for the fake of their hides
and the slaughter at certain seasons is so great, that the fiench
of the carcases, which are left in the field, would affect the
air, if large packs of wild dogs, and vast flocks of gallinazos,
or American vultures, the most voracious of all the feathered
kind, did not inflantly devour them. The number of those
hides exported in every fleet to Europe is prodigious, and is a
lucrative branch of commerce P.

ALMOST all these may be confidered as staple commodities

peculiar to America, and different, if we except that last men-
tioned, from the productions of the mother-country.

that with the produc of these, flhe was able both to purchase -
the commodities of the New World, and to anfier its growing
demands. Under the reigns of Ferdinand and Isabella, and
Charles V. Spain was one of the most industrious countries
in Europe. Her manufactures in wool, and flax, and silk, wcre
so extensive, as not only to furnish what was fuflicient for lher
own consumption, but to afford a surplus for exportation.
\Ihen a market for them, formerly unknown, and to which file
alone had access, opened in America, fie had recourse to her
domestic flore, and found there an abundant supply'. This
new employment mufft naturally have added vivacity to the spirit
of industry. Nourished and invigorated by it, the manufactures,
the population, and wealth of Spain might have gone on in-
creasing in the fame proportion with the growth of her colo-
nies. Nor was the slate of the Spanifil marine at this peiiod
less flourifhling than that of its manufacures. In the beginning
of the sixteenth century, Spain is said to have pofleffed above a
thousand merchant flips', a number probably far superior to
that of any nation in Europe. By the aid which foreign trade
and domestic industry give reciprocally to each other in their
progress, the augmentation of both muff have been rapid and
extensive, and Spain might have received the fame acccllion of
opulence and vigour from her acquisitions in the New \Vorld,
that other powers have derived from their colonies there.

denly, and with too full a fiream, it overturns all fober plans of
industry, and brings along with it a taste for what is wild, and
extravagant, and daring in business or in action. Such was the
great and sudden augmentation of power and revenue, that the
possession of America brought into Spain, and some symptoms of
its pernicious influence upon the political operations of that
monarchy soon began to appear. For a considerable time,
however, the supply of treasure from the New World was scanty
and precarious, and the genius of Charles V. conducted public
measures with such prudence, that the effects of this influence
were little perceived. But when Philip II. ascended the Spanish
throne, with talents far inferior to those of his father, and re-
* mittances from the colonies became a regular and vast branch of
revenue, the fatal operation of this rapid change in the state of
the kingdom, both on the monarch and his people, was at
once conspicuous. Philip, possessing that spirit of unceasing
assiduity, which often characerizes the ambition of men of
moderate talents, entertained such an high opinion of his own
resources, that he thought nothing too arduous for him to under-
take. Shut up himself in the solitude of the Escurial, he
troubled and annoyed all the nations around him. He waged
open war with the Dutch and English; he encouraged and aid-
ed a rebellious faction in France; he conquered Portugal, and
maintained armies and garrisons in Italy, Africa, and both the
Indies. By such a multiplicity of great andcomplicated opera-
tions, pursued with ardour during the course of a long reign,
Spain was drained both of men and money. Under the weak
adminifiration of his successor, Philip III. the vigour of the na-
tion continued to decrease, and funk into the lowest decline,

when the inconsiderate bigotry of that monarch expelled at once B V 0 K
near a million of his most industrious fubjecs, at the very time ----
when the exhausted itate of the kingdom required some extraor-
dinary exertion of political wisdom to augment its numbers, and
to revive its strength. Early in the seventeenth century, Spain
felt such a diminution in the number of her people, that from
inability to recruit her armies, she was obliged to contract her
operations, Her flourishing manufactures were fallen into de-
cay. Her fleets, which had been the terror of all Europe, were
ruined. Her extensive foreign commerce was loft. The trade
between different parts of her own dominions was interrupted,
and the (hips which attempted to carry it on, were taken and
plundered by enemies, whom she once defpiled. Even agri-
culture, the primary object of industry in every prosperous
tlate, was neglected, and one of the most fertile countries in
Europe hardly raised what was sufficient for the support of its
own inhabitants.

In proportion as the population and manufactures of the Rapiddecline

parent state declined, the demands of her colonies continued to ofits trade.
increase. The Spaniards, like their monarchs, intoxicated with
the wealth which poured in annually upon them, defirtccl the
paths of induflry, to which they had been accuflomed, and re-
paired with eagerness to those regions from which this opulence
if'ued. By this rage of emigration, another drain was opened,
and the strength of the colonies augmented by exhatlfling that
of the mother-country. All those emigrants, as well as the
adventurers, who had at first fettled in Anerica, depended ab-
lolutely upon Spain for almost every article of neceflary con-
fuimption. Engaged in more alluring andl lucrative purflitis,
or prevented by restraints which government iinpofed, they

B Vl0 K could not turn their own attention towards establishing the ma-

VIII.

(as I have observed in another place) their cloathing, their fur-
niture, whatever ministers to the ease or luxury of life, and
even their infiruments of labour, fiom Europe. Spain, thinned
of people, and void of industry, was unable to supply their in-
creasing demands. She had recourse to her neighbours. The
manufacures of the Low Countries, of England, of France,
and of Italy, which her wants called into existence, or animated
with new vivacity, furnished in abundance whatever she re-
quired. In vain did the fundamental law, concerning the ex-
clufion of foreigners from trade with America, oppose this in-
novation. Necessity, more powerful than any statute, defeat-
ed its operations, and conitrained the Spaniards themselves to
concur in eluding it. The English, the French, and Dutch,
relying on the fidelity and honour of Spanish merchants, who
lend their names to cover the deceit, fend out their manufacures
to America, and receive the exorbitant price for which theyare
fold there, either in specie, or in the rich commodities of the
New World. Neither the dread of danger, nor the allure-
ment of profit, ever induced a Spanish facor to betray or de-
fraud the person who confided in him'; and that probity,
which is the pride and diflindion of the nation, contributes to
its ruin. In a short time, not above a twentieth part of the
commodities exported to America was of Spanilh growth or fa-
bric'. All the reft was the property of foreign merchants,
though entered in the name of Spaniards* The treasure of the
New World may be said henceforward not to have belonged
to Spain. Before it reached Europe, it was anticipated as the

price of goods purchased from foreigners. That wealth B ° ° K
which, by an internal circulation, would have spread through ----
each vein of industry, and have conveyed life and activity to
every branch of manufacture, flowed out of the kingdom with
such a rapid course, as neither enriched nor animated it. On
the other hand, the artisans of rival nations, encouraged by
this quick sale of their commodities, improved so much in skill
and industry, as to be able to afford them at a rate so low, that
the manufatures of Spain, which could not vie with theirs,
either in quality or cheapness of work, were flill farther de-
pressed. This deftrutive commerce drained off the riches of
the nation faster and more completely, than even the extrava-
gant schemes of ambition carried on by its monarchs. Spain
was so much astonished and difirefied, at beholding her Ame-
rican treasures vanish almost as soon as they were imported,
that Philip III. unable to supply what was requisite in circulation,
issued an edic, by which he endeavoured to raise copper
money, to a value in currency nearly equal to that of silver ";
and the lord of the Peruvian and Mexican mines was reduced
to a wretched expedient, which is the last resource of petty im--
poverifhed states.

THUS the pofeffieons of Spain in America have not proved

a source of population and of wealth to her, in the fame man-
ner as those of other nations. In the countries of Europe,
where the spirit of industry subsists in full vigour, every person
fettled in such colonies, as are similar in their situation to
those of Spain, is supposed to give employment to three or four
at home in supplying his wants ". But wherever the mother-

B o i K country cannot afford this supply, every emigrant may be con-
'-- fidered as a citizen loft to the community, and firangers must

reap all the benefit ofanfwering'his demands.

Increased by SUCeH has been the' internal .Rate of Spain from the close of
the mode of
regulatingits the sixteenth century, and such her inability to supply the grow-
with Aure ing wants of her colonies. The fatal effeas of this difpropor-
rica. tion between their demands, and her capacity of answering

them, have been much increafod by the mode in which Spain
has endeavoured to regulate the intercourse between the mo-
ther-country and the colonies. It is from her idea of monopo-
lizing the trade with America, and debarring her fubjets there
from any communication with foreigners, that all her jealous
and systematic arrangements have arisen. These are so singular
in their nature and consequences, as to merit a particular ex-
planation. In order to secure the monopoly at which she aim-
ed, Spain did not vest the trade with her colonies in an exclu-
five company, a plan which has been adopted by nations more
commercial, and at a period when mercantile policy was an ob-
jed of greater attention, and ought to have been better under-
flood. The Dutch gave up the whole trade with their colonies,
both in the East and Well Indies, to exclusive companies. The
English, the French, the Danes, have imitated their example
with refped to the East Indian commerce; and the two former
have laid a similar refiraint upon tome branches of their trade
with the New World. The wit of man cannot, perhaps, de-
vise a method for checking the progress of-4nduflry and popula-
tion in a new colony more effeCual than this. The intercll of
the colony, and of the exclusive company, mull in every point
be diametrically opposite ; and as the latter poflseses such advan-
tages in this unequal contefr, that it can prescribe at pleasure

S

the

the terms of intercourse, the former mutl not only buy dear B o ) K
and fell cheap, but muft-fuffer the mortification of having the ---
increase of its surplus flock discouraged by those very persons
to whom alone it can dispose of its productions y.

SPAIN, it is probable, was preserved from falling into this This confil-

error in policy, by the high ideas which ihe early formed con- port in Spain,
cerning the riches of the New World. Gold and silver were
commodities of too high value to vest a monopoly of them in
private hands. The crown wished to retain the direction of a
commerce so inviting; and in order to secure that, ordained
the cargo of every ship fitted out for America, to be infpeded
by the officers of the Crla de Contratacion in Seville, before it
could receive a licence to make the voyage; and that on its re-
turn, a report of the commodities which it brought should be
made to the fame board, before it could be permitted to land
them. In consequence of this regulation, all the trade of Spain
with the New World centred in the port of Seville, and was
gradually brought into a form, in which it has been conducted,
with little variation, from the middle of the sixteenth century
almost to our own times. For the greater security of the valu-
able cargoes sent to America, as well as for the more easy pre-
vention of fraud, the commerce of Spain with its colonies is
carried on by fleets, which fail under firong convoys. Tlhelc
fleets confifing of two squadrons, one diflinguifhed by the name
of Galeons, the other by that of the Flora, are equipped annually.
Formerly they took their departure f-om Seville; but as the
port of Cadiz has been found more commodious, they have fail-
ed from it since the year 1720.

touch first at Carthagena, and then at Porto-bello. To the
former, the merchants of Santa Martha, Caraccas, the New
Kingdom of Granada, and several other provinces retort. The
latter is the great mart for the rich commerce of Peru and Chili.
At the season when the Galeons are expected, the product of all the
mines in these two kingdoms, together with their other valuable
commodities, is transported by Tea to Panama. From thence,
as soon as the appearance of the fleet from Europe is announced,
they are conveyed across the isthmus, partly on mules, and
partly down the river Chagre to Porto-bello. This paltry vil-
lage, whose climate, from the pernicious union of excessive
heat, continual moisture, and the putrid exhalations arising
from a rank foil, is more fatal to life than any perhaps in the
known world, is immediately filled with people. From being
the residence of a few negroes and mulattoes, and of a miserable
garrison relieved every three months, its streets are crowded
with opulent merchants from every corner of Peru, and the ad-
jacent provinces. A fair is opened, the wealth of America is
exchanged for the manufatures of Europe, and during its
prescribed term of forty days, the richest traffic on the face of
the earth is begun and finished, with that simplicity of tranfac-
tion and unbounded confidence, which accompany extensive
and Flo'a. commerce'. The Flota holds its course to Vera Cruz. The

Both fleets, as soon as they have completed their cargoes from

THE trade of Spain with her colonies, while thus fettered and Bad effe& of

this arrange~

reftriced, came necessarily to be conducted with the fame spirit, ment.
and upon the fame principles, as that of an exclusive company.
Being confined to a single port, it was of course thrown into a
few hands, and almost the whole of it was gradually engrossed by
a'fmall number of wealthy houses, formerly in Seville, and now
in Cadiz. These by combinations, which they can easily form,
may altogether prevent that competition which preserves commo-
dities at their natural price; and by acting in concert, to which
they are prompted by their mutual interest, they may raise or
lower the value of them at pleasure. In consequence of this,
the price of European goods in America is always high, and
often exorbitant. A hundred, two hundred, and even three
hundred per cent. are profits not uncommon in the commerce of
Spain with her colonies . From the fame ingrowing spirit it
frequently happens, that traders of the second order, whose
warehouses do not contain a complete affortmcnt of commodi-
ties for the American market, cannot purchafc from the more
opulent merchants, such goods as they want, at a lower price than
that for which they are fold in the colonies. With tlie atme
vigilant jealousy that an exclusive company guards againfn the
intrusion of the free trader, those overgrown monopolifls en-

B 0 K they dreadb. But this retfraint of the American commerce to
', ---.- one port, not only affeCts its domestic state, but limits its foreign

operations. A monopolist may acquire more, and certainly wvill
hazard less, by a confined trade which yields exorbitant profit,
than by an extensive commerce in which he receives only a
moderate return of gain. It is often his interest not to enlarge,
but to circumscribe the sphere of his acivity; and instead of
calling forth more vigorous exertions of commercial industry,
it may be the objec of his attention to check and set bounds to
them. By some such maxim, the mercantile policy of Spain
seems to.have regulated its intercourse with America. Inflead
of furnishing the colonies with European goods in such quantity
as might render both the price and the profit moderate; the
merchants of Seville and Cadiz seem to have supplied them with
a sparing hand, that the eagerness of competition amongst
customers obliged to purchase in a scanty market, might enable
their fators to dispose of their cargoes with exorbitant gain.
About the middle of the last century, when the exclusive trade
to America from Seville was in its most flourishing state, the
burden of the two united squadrons of the Galeons and Flota,
did not exceed twenty-feven thousand five hundred tons '. The
supply which luch a fleet could carry, must have been very in-
adequate to the demands of those populous and extensive co-
lonies, which depended upon it for all the luxuries, and many
of the neceflaries of life. ,

ployed their thoughts in devising methods for reviving the de- B ° I K
caying industry and commerce of their country. From the -i-.
violence of the remedies proposed, we may judge how desperate
and fatal the malady appeared. Some, confounding a violation
of police with criminality against the state, contended, that in
order to check illicit commerce, every person convited of carry-
ing it on, should be puniflhed with death, and confiscation of
all his effets d. Others, forgetting the diflindion between civil
offences and ads of impiety, insisted, that contraband trade
should be ranked among the crimes reserved for the cognizance
of the Inquisition; that such as were guilty of it might be tried
and punished, according to the secret and summary form in
which that dreadful tribunal exercises its jurifeidtion '. Others,
uninfiruted by observing the pernicious effects of monopolies
in every country where they have been eftabliffied, have pro-
posed to vest the trade with America in exclusive companies,
which interest would render the most vigilant guardians of the
Spanish commerce againfi the encroachments of interlopers f.

BESIDE there wild projects, many fchemncs better digefled

and more beneficial, were fuggelted. But under the feeble
monarchs, with whom the reign of the Austrian line in Spain,

i- J There evils continued to increase, and Spain, with dominions

more extensive and more opulent than any European state,
possessed neither vigour, nor moneyh, nor industry. At length,
the violence of a great national convulsion rouzed the slumber-
ing genius of Spain. The efforts of the two contending parties
in the civil war, kindled by the dispute concerning the fuc-
ceilion of the crown at the beginning of this century, called forth,
in fomedegree, the ancient spirit and vigour of the nation. While
men were thus forming, capable of adopting more liberal senti-
ments, than those which had influenced the councils of the mo-
narchy during the course of a century, Spain derived from an
unexpected source the means of availing itself of their talents.
The various powers who favoured the pretensions either of the
Aufirian or Bourbon candidate for the Spanish throne, sent
formidable fleets and armies to their support, France, England,
and Holland remitted immense fums to Spain. These were
spent in the provinces which became the theatre of war. Part
of the American treasure, of which they had drained the king-
dom, flowed back thither. From this aera, one of the most
intelligent Spanish authors dates the revival of the monarchy;
and, however humiliating the truth may be, he acknowledges,
that it is to her enemies his country is indebted for the ac-
quifition of a fund of circulating specie, in some measure ade-

iquate to the exigencies of the public '.

to suppress an innovation which had crept in during the course of
the war, and overturned the whole fyftemof the Spanish commerce by excludingr
with America. The English and Dutch, by theirfuperiorityin na- froeitade

all intercourse between Spain and her colonies, Spain, in order to
furnish her fubjeas in America those necessaries of life, without
which they could not exist, and as the only means of receiving
from thence any part of their treasure, departed so far from the
usual rigour of its maxims, as to open the trade with Peru to
her allies the French. The merchants of St. Malo, to whom
Louis XIV. granted the privilege of this lucrative commerce,
engaged in it with vigour, and carried it on upon principles
very different from those of the Spaniards. They supplied Peru:
with European commodities at a moderate price, and not in.
stinted quantity. The goods which they imported were con-
veyed to every province of Spanifi America, in such abundance
as had never been known in any former period. If this in-
tercourfe had been continued, the exportation of European
commodities from Spain mufl have ceased, and the dependence
of the colonies on the mother-country have been at an end.
The molt peremptory injunctions were therefore issued, prohi- 17r13
biting the admission of foreign vcffels into any port of Peru
or Chili k, and a Spanish squadron was employed to clear the
South Sea of intruders, whose aid was no longer necclrary.

bontab cin one encroachment on her commercial system, she was exposed to
trade, another which she deemed hardly less pernicious. As an in-

ducement that might prevail with Queen Anne to conclude a
peace, which France and Spain desired with equal ardour,

particularly of Philip V. not only conveyed to Great Britain the Ajiento, or con-
Affirto corn- traa for supplying the Spanish colonies with negroes, which had
pany, formerly been enjoyed by France, but granted it the more ex-

traordinary privilege of fending annually to the fair of Porto-
bello a ship of five hundred tons, laden with European commo-
dities. In consequence of this, British factories were established
at Carthagena, Panama, Vera Cruz, Buenos Ayres, and other
Spanish settlements. The veil with which Spain had hitherto
covered the slate and tranfaaions of her colonies was removed.
The agents of a rival nation, residing in the towns of most ex-
tensive trade, and of chief resort, had the belt opportunities of
becoming acquainted with the interior condition of the American
provinces, of observing their flated and occasional wants, and of
knowing what commodities might be imported into them with
the greatest advantage. In consequence of information so au-
thentic and expeditious, the merchants of Jamaica, and other
English colonies who traded to the Spanifl main, were enabled
to assort and proportion their cargoes, so exacly to the demands
of the market, that the contraband commerce was carried on
with a facility, and to an extent unknown4in any former pe-
riod. This, however, was not the most fatal consequence of
the Affiento to the trade of Spain. The agents of the Britifli
South Sea Company, under cover of the importation which
they were authorised to make by the flip sent annually to Porto-
.bcllo, poured in their commodities on the Spanifli continent,

panied by two or three smaller ve{fels, which mooring in rome

of goods, to replace such as were fold. The infpecors of the
fair, and officers of the revenue, gained by exorbitant presents,
connived-at the fraud'. Thus, partly by the operations of the
company, and partly by the activity of private interlopers, al-
most the whole trade of Spanifli America was ingroffed by so-
reigners. The immense commerce of the Galcons, formerly

home the royal revenue arising from the fifth on silver.

WHILE Spain observed those encroachments, and felt so fen- GuardaCof-

some effort to restrain them. Her first expedient was to station pose.
fluips of force, under the appellation of Guarida CoJtas, upon the
coasts of those provinces, to which interlopers most fiequently
resorted. As private interest concurred with the duty which they
owed to the public, in rendering the officers who commanded
those vefiels vigilant and ative, some check was given to the
progress of the contraband trade, though in dominions so ex-
tensive, and so accessible by sea, no number of cruizers was
fufficicnt to guard againfl its inroads in every quarter. This
interruption of an intercourls, which had been carried on with
so much facility, that the merchants in the Briillh colonies

ed, in some measure, and rendered more interesting, by several
unjustifiable aas of violence committed by the captains of the
'739- Spanish Guarda Costas, precipitated Great Britain into a war

with Spain, by which the latter obtained a final release from
the Affiento, and was left at liberty to regulate the commerce
of her colonies, without being restrained by any engagement
with a foreign power.

The use of As the formidable encroachments of the English on their
regifler ships
introduced. American trade, had discovered to the Spaniards the vast

consumption of European goods in their colonies, and taught
them the advantage of accommodating their importations to the
occasional demand of the various provinces, they perceived the
necessity of devising some method of supplying their colonies,
different from their ancient one, of fending thither periodical
fleets. That mode of communication had been found not only to
be uncertain, as the departure of the Galeons and Flota was some-
times retarded by various accidents, and often prevented by the
wars which raged in Europe, but to be ill adapted to afford Ame-
rica a regular and timely supply of what it wanted. The scarcity
of European goods in the Spanish settlements frequently became
exceflive; their price rose to an enormous height; the vigilant
eye of mercantile attention did not fail to observe this favour-
able opportunity, an ample supply was poured in by interlo-
pers from the English, the French, and Hutch islands; and
when the Galeons at length arrived, they found the markets so
glutted by this illicit commerce, that there was no demand for
the commodities with which they were loaded. In order to re-
medy this, Spain permitted a considerable part of her commerce

with

with America, to be carried on by regiferJhips. These are B o o K
fitted out, during the intervals between the flated seasons when <-
the Galeons and Flota fail, by merchants in Seville or Cadiz, up-
on obtaining a licence from the council of the Indies, for which
they pay a very high premium, and are destined for those ports
where any extraordinary demand is foreseen or expected. By
this expedient, such a regular supply of fresh commodities is
conveyed to the American market, that the interloper is no
longer allured by the fame profped of excessive gain, or the
people in the colonies urged by the fame necessity, to en-
gage in the hazardous adventures of contraband trade.

IN proportion as experience manifested the advantages of car- The galeons

creased; and at length, in the year 1748, the Galeons, after hav-
ing been employed upwards of two centuries, were finally laid
aside. From that period there has been no intercourse with
Chili and Peru but by single lhips, dispatched from time to time
as occasion requires, and when the merchants expect a market will
open. These fail round Cape Horn,and convey directly to the ports
in the South Sea the produfcions and manufactures of Europe, for
which the people fettled in those countries were formerly oblig-
ed to repair to Porto-bello or Panama. These towns, as has been
formerly observed, must gradually decline, when deprived of
that commerce to which they owed their exiflence. This dif-
advantage however is more than compensated, for the whole
continent of South America receives supplies of European com-
modities, with so much regularity, and in such abundance, as
must contribute greatly to the happinels and prop)erity of all the
colonies fettled there. But as all the rcgifler flips deflined for
the South Seas, must still take their departure from Cadiz, and

Schemes for NOR has the attention of Spain been confined to regulating
reviingcom- the trade with its more flourishing colonies, it has extended like-

wife to the reviving commerce in those settlements where it was
negleted, or had decayed. Among the new taftes which the
people of Europe have acquired, in consequence of their inter-
course with the natives of those countries which they conquered
in America, that for chocolate is one of the most universal. The
use of this liquor made with a paste, formed of the nut, or al-
mond of the cacao-tree, compounded withvarious ingredients, the
Spaniards first learned from the Mexicans; and it has appeared
to them, and to the other European nations, so palatable, so
nourishing, and so wholerome, that it has become a commercial
article of considerable importance. The cacao-tree grows fpon-
taneoufly in several parts of the torrid zone; but the nuts of the
best quality; next to those of Guatimala, on the South Sea, are pro-
duced in the rich plains of Caraccas, a province of Tierra Firmc.
In consequence of this acknowledged superiority in the quality of
cacao in that province, and its communication with the Atlantic,
which facilitates the conveyance to Europe, the culture of the cacao
there is more extensive than in any dif'ridc of America. But the
Dutch, by the vicinity of their fettlementsin the frmall islands
of Curazoa and Buen-Ayre, to the coast of Caraccas, gradually
ingroffed the greatest part of the cacao trade. The traffic with the
mother-country for this valuable commodity ceased almost en-

tirely; and such was the supine negligence of the Spaniards, B Ol K
or the defecs of their commercial arrangements, that they .----
were obliged to receive from the hands of foreigners this pro-
duntion of their own colonies, at an exorbitant price. In order
to remedy an evil no less dilgraceful, than pernicious to his sub- by eRlablish-
jeEs, PhilipV. in the year I728, granted to a body of merchants, ipnghOfC
an exclusive right to the commerce with Caraccas and Cumana, raccas.
oncondition of their employing, at their own expence, a sufficient
number of armed vcfels to clear the coast of interlopers. This
society, distinguished sometimes by the name of the company of
Guipufcoa, from the province of Spain in which it is eflablifled,
and sometimes by that of the Company of Caraccas, from the
difirid of America to which it trades, has carried on its opera-
tions with such vigour and success, that Spain has recovered an
important branch of commerce, which flhe had suffered to be
wrefled from her, and is plentifully supplied with an article of
extensive consumption at a moderate price. Not only the pa-
rent slate, but the colony of Caraccas, has derived great ad-
vantages from this institution; for although, at the sirss aspect,
it may appear to be one of those monopolies, whose tendency
;s to check the spirit of industry, instead of calling it forth to
new exertions, it has been prevented from operating in this man-
ner, by several salutary regulations, fiamed upon forcfight of
such bad effects, and of purpose to obviate them. The plant-
ers in the Caraccas are not left to depend entirely on the com-
pany, either for the importation of European commodities, or
the sale of their own productions. The inhabitants of the Ca-
nary islands have the privilege of lending thither annually a
regifler ship of considerable burden- ; and from Vera Cruz in
New Spain, a free trade is permitted in every port compre-
hended in the charter of the company. In consequence of this,

at its natural and equitable rate. Thecompany has not the power
of raising the former, or degrading the latter at pleasure; and
accordingly, since it was established, the increase of culture, of
population, and of live Rock, in the province of Caraccas has
been very considerable°.

Enlargement BUT as it is slowly that nations relinquish any system which
of commer-
cial ideas in time has rendered venerable, or that commerce can be diverted

Philip V. in his new regulations concerning the American
trade, paid such deference to the ancient maxim of Spain, con-
cerning the limitation of all importation from the New World
to one harbour, as to oblige both the register ships which return-
ed from Peru, and those of the Guipofcoan Company from Ca-
raccas, to deliver their cargoes in the port of Cadiz. Since his
reign, sentiments more liberal and enlarged begin to spread in
Spain. The spirit of philosophical inquiry, which it is the glory
of the present age to have turned from frivolous or abstruse
speculations, to the business and affairs of men, has extended
its influence beyond the Pirenees. In the researches of ingenious
authors, concerning the police or commerce of nations, the er-
rors and defeds of the Spanish system with refpea to both met
every eye, and have not only been exposed with severity, but
are held up as a warning to other fates. The Spaniards, stung
with the reproaches of there authors, or convinced by their
arguments, and admonished by several enlightened writers of
their own country, seem at length to have discovered the de-

any intercourse with them, but that which was carried on by
her annual fleets. There was no establishment for a regular
communication of either public or private intelligence, between
the mother-country and its American settlements. From the want
of this necessary inflitution, the operations of the ltate, as well
as the business of individuals, were retarded or conducted un-
skilfully, and Spain often received from foreigners her first in-
formation with refpea to very interesting events in her own co-
lonies. But though this defec in police was sensibly felt, and
the remedy for it was obvious, that jealous spirit with which
the Spanish monarchs guarded the exclusive trade, refrained
them from applying it. At length Charles Ill. surmounted
those considerations which had deterred his predeceflors, and in
the year 1764, appointed packet-boats to be dispatched on the
first day of each month, from Corugna to the -Iavanna or Porto-
Rico. From thence letters are conveyed in fnaller veflels to
Vera Cruz and Porto-bello, and transmitted by poll through
the kingdoms of Tierra Firme, Granada, Peru, and New Spain.
With no less regularity packet-boats fail once in two months to
Rio de la Plata, for the accommodation of the provinces to the
east of the Andes. Thus provision is made for a speedy and

- of Spain, from which equal advantages must redound to the

political and mercantile interest of the kingdom P. With this
new arrangement, a scheme of extending commerce has been
more immediately connected. Each of the packet-boats, which
are vessels of some considerable burden, is allowed to take in
half a loading of such commodities as are the product of Spain,
and most in demand in the ports whither they are bound. In
return for there they may bring home to Corugna an equal
quantity of American produetions 9. This may be confidered
as the first relaxations of those rigid laws, which confined the
trade with the New World to a tingle port, and the first attempt
to admit the reft of the kingdom to some share in it.

Free trade IT was soon followed by one more decisive. In the year
perm po- 1 765, Charles III. laid open the trade to the windward islands,
vunces. Cuba, Hispaniola, Porto Rico, Margarita, and Trinidad, to his

fubjests in every province of Spain. i e permitted them to fail
from certain ports in each of there, specified in the edil, at
any season, and with whatever cargo they deemed most proper,
without any other warrant than a simple clearance from the
custom-house of the place whence they took their departure.
He released them from the numerous and oppressive duties im-
posed on goods exported to America, and in place of the whole
fubflituted a moderate tax of fix in the hundred on the com-
modities sent from Spain. He allowed them to return either
to the fame port, or to any other where they might hope for a
more advantageous market, and there to enter the homeward
cargoe, on payment of the usual duties. This ample privilege

which at once broke through all the fences, which the jealous B o o K
policy of Spain had been labouring for two centuries and a half
to throw round its commercial intercourse with the New World,
was soon after extended to Louisiana, and to the provinces of
Yucatan and Campeachy r.

THE propriety of this innovation, which may be confidered Beneficial cf-

as the most liberal effort of Spanish legislation, has appeared fes of it.
from its effets. Prior to the edit in favour of the free trade,
Spain derived hardly any benefit.from its negleced colonies in
Hispaniola, Porto-Rico, Margarita, and Trinidad. Its com-
merce with Cuba was inconsiderable, and that of Yucatan and
Campeachy was ingrofled almost entirely by interlopers. But
as soon as a general liberty of trade was permitted, the inter-
course with those provinces revived, and has gone on with a
rapidity of progrefiion, of which there are few examples in the
hitlory of nations. In less than ten years, the trade of Cuba
has been more than tripled. Even in those settlements where,
from the languishing fate of indulfry, greater efforts were
requisite to restore its acivity, their commerce has been
doubled. It is computed, that such a number of ships is
already employed in the free trade, that the tonnage of them
far exceeds that of the Galeons and Flota, at the most flourish-
ing sera of their commerce. The benefits of this arrangement
are not confined to a few merchants, established in a favourite
port. They are diffused through every province of the king-
dom; and by opening a new market for their various produc-
tions and manufaCtures, must encourage and add vivacity to the
industry of the farmer and artificcr. Nor does the kingdom

B o K' profit only by what it exports, it derives advantage likewise

__

soon able to supply itself with several commodities of extensive
consumption, for which it formerly depended on foreigners.
The consumption of sugar in Spain is perhaps as great in pro-
portion to the number of its inhabitants, as that of any Euro-
pean kingdom. But though possessed of countries in the New
World, whose foil and climate are most proper for rearing the
sugar-cane, though tile domestic culture of that valuable plant
in the kingdom of Granada was once considerable, such has
been the fatal tendency of ill-judged institutions in America,
and such the pressure of improper taxes in Europe, that Spain
has loft almost entirely this branch of industry, which has
enriched other nations. This commodity, which has now
become an article of primary necessity in Europe, the Spaniards
were obliged to purchase of foreigners, and had the mortifica-
tion to fee their country drained annually of an immense furn
on that account '. But if that spirit, which the permission of
free trade has put in motion, shall persevere in its efforts with
the fame vigour, the cultivation of sugar in Cuba and Porto
Rico, may increase so much, that in a few years their growth
may be equal to the demand of the kingdom.

Free trade SPAIN has been induced by her experience of the beneficial

trei the consequences rctulting from having relaxed somewhat of the
cAonica. rigour of her ancient laws with refpea to the commerce of the

mother-country with the colonies, to permit a more liberal
intercourse of one colony with another. By one of the jealous

ing any supply of their wants, but by the periodical fleets from
Europe; that in order to guard against this, it cruelly debarred.
the Spaniards in Peru, in New Spain, in Guatinala, and the
New Kingdom of Granada, from such a correspondence with
their fellow-fubjeas, as tended manifestly to their mutual pro-
fperity. Of all the numerous reltrictions devised by Spain for
securing the exclusive trade with her American settlements, none
perhaps was more illiberal, none seems to have been more fen-
sibly felt, or to have produced more hurtful effeas. This
grievance coeval with the settlements of Spain in the NewWorld,
is at last redrefied. In the year I774, Charles III. published an
edid, granting to the four vast provinces which I have men-
tioned, the privilege of a free trade with each other . What
may be the effecs of opening this communication between coun-
tries destined by their iituation for reciprocal intercourse, cannot
yet be determined by experience. They can hardly fail of
being beneficial and extentivc. The motives for granting this
permission are manifetlly no less laudable, than the principle on
which it is founded is liberal; and both difcovcr the progrels of

in the New World, that several places subjed to thejurifdidion .- --
of each viceroy, were at such an enormous distance from the
capitals in which they resided, that neither their attention,
nor their authority, could reach so far. Some provinces
subordinate to the viceroy of New Spain, lay above two thou-
sand miles from Mexico. There are countries subjea to the
viceroy of Peru fiill farther from Lima. The people in thole
remote dirtrids could hardly be said to enjoy the benefit of
civil government. The oppression and insolence of its inferior
miniflers they often feel, and rather submit to these in filencc,
than involve themselves in the expence and trouble of resort-
ing to the distant capitals, where alone they can find redress.
As a remedy for this, a fourth vice-royalty has been ereted, New vic-

Rio de la Plata, Buenos-Ayres, Paraguay, Tucuman, Potofi, on Rio dela
Sta. Cruz de la Sierra, Charcas, and the towns of Mendoza and
St. Juan. By this well-judged arrangement, two advantages
are gained. All the inconveniences occasioned by the remote
situation of those provinces, which had been long felt, and long
complained of, are removed. The countries moll diflant from
Lima are separated fiom the vice-royalty of Peru, and united
under a superior, whose feat of government at 1Buenos-Ayrcs
will be commodious and acccifible. The contraband trade with
the Portuguese, which was become so extcnfive, as muffi have
put a final flop to the exportation of commodities from Spain
to her southern colonies, may be checked more tloroughly, and
with greater facility, when the supreme magifiratc, by his vi-

grefs and effecs witl his own eyes. Don Pedro Zevallos, who
has been raiscd to this new dignity, with appointments equal

dismemberment, succeeding that which took place at the erecion
of the vice-royalty of the New Kingdom of Granada, almost

viceroy, nor does he enjoy the appointments belonging to that
rank, but his jurifdidion is altogether independent on the
vice-royalty of New Spain. The erection of this last government
teems to have been suggested, not only by the consideration of
the remote situation of those provinces from Mexico; but by at-
tention to the late discoveries made there, which I have men-
tioned Y. Countries containing such riches, and which probably
may rife into fich importance, required the immediate infpec-
tion of a governor, to whom they were specially committed.
As every consideration of duty, of interest, and of vanity,
muff concur in prompting those new governors to encourage
such exertions as tend to diffufc opulence and p'rosperity through
the provinces committed to their charge, the beneficial eff'cas of
this arrangement may be considerable. Many difhrids in Ame-

SUCH, since the accession of the Bourbons to the throne of .Atem;-:!'o

Spain, has been the progress of their regulations, and the gra- n!elic polic).
dual expansion of their views with refpec to the commerce and
government of their American colonies. Nor has their atten-
tion been so entirely engrossed by what related to the more re-
mote parts of their dominions, as to render them neglectful of
what was flill more important, the reformation of domeflic
errors and defects in policy. Fully sensible of the causes to
which the declension of Spain, from her former prosperity,
ought to be imputed; they have made it a great object of their
policy, to revive a spirit of industry among their fubjccts, and
to give such extent and perfection to their manufacures, that
they may be able to supply the demands of America from their
own flock, and to exclude foreigners from a branch of com-
merce which has been so fatal to the kingdom. This they have
endeavoured to accomplish, by a variety of edicts issued since
the peace of Utrecht. They have granted bounties for the en-
couragement of some branches of industry; they have lowered
the taxes on others ; they have prohibited, or have loaded with
additional duties, such foreign manufactures as come in competi-
tion with their own; they have instituted focicties for the im-
provement of trade and agriculture; they have planted colonies
of husbandmen in some uncultivated diftrids of Spain, and di-
vided among them the waste fields; they have had recourse to
every expedient, devised by commercial wisdom, or commercial
jcaloufy, for reviving their own indufliy, and difcountcnancilng
that of other nations. Thece, however, it is not my province to

VIII. -----' is no effort of legislation more arduous, no experiment in po-

licy more uncertain, than an attempt to revive the spirit of in-
duftry where it has declined, or to introduce it where it is un-
known. Nations already possessed of extensive commerce, en-
ter into competition with such advantages, derived from the
large capitals of their merchants, the dexterity of their manu-
facturers, the alertness acquired by habit in every department
of business, that the tfate which aims at rivalling, or supplant-
ing them, muff expect to struggle with many difficulties, and
be content to advance slowly. If the quantity of productive in-
duftry now in Spain, be compared with that of the kingdom
under the last listless monarchs of the Aufirian line, its progress
must appear considerable, and is sufficient to alarm the jealousy,
and to call forth the most vigorous efforts of the nations now in
possession of the lucrative trade which the Spaniards aim at
wresting from them. One circumstance may render those exer-
tions of Spain an object of more serious attention to the other
European powers. They are not to be ascribed wholly to the
influence of the crown and its ministers. The sentiments and
spirit of the people esem to second the provident care of their
monarchs, and to give it greater effect. The nation has adopted
more liberal ideas, not only with respect to commerce, but do-
meftic policy. In all the later Spanish writers, defeEts in the ar-
rangements of their country concerning both are acknowledged,
and remedies proposed, which pride would not have allowed their
ancestors to confers, and ignorance rendered them incapable of
discerning L. But after all that the Spaniards have done, much
remains to do. Many pernicious institutions and abuses, deeply

incorporated with the system of internal policy and taxation, B o o K
which has been long established in Spain, must be abolished .
before induflry and manufactures can recover an extensive
activity.

STILL, however, the commercial regulations of Spain with Contraband

refped to her colonies, are too rigid and systematical to be car- trade
ried into complete execution. The legislature that loads trade
with impositions too heavy, or fetters it by reflridions too fe-
vere, defeats its own intention; and, in truth, is only multi-
plying the inducements to violate its flatutes, and proposing an
high premium to encourage illicit traffic. The Spaniards, both
in Europe and America, circumscribed in their mutual inter-
course by the jealousy, or oppressed by the exactions of the
crown, have their invention continually on the stretch how to
elude its edids. The vigilance and ingenuity of private in-
terest discover means of effeEting this, which public wisdom
cannot foresee, nor public authority prevent. This spirit,
counteracting that of the laws, pervades the commerce of
Spain with America in all its branches; and from the highest
departments in government, descends to the lowest. The very
officers appointed to check contraband trade, are often employ-
cd as inflruments in carrying it on; and the boards inflituted to
rcefrain and punish it, are the channels through lwhich it flows.
The king is fuppoic2d to be defi-auded by various artifices, of
more than one half of the revenue which he ought to receive
from America Y; and as long as it is the intcrcf of so many per-

increased the evils which he lamented as early as the reign of
Philip II. A spirit of corruption has infected all the colonies
of Spain in America. Men far removed from the feat of go-
vernment; impatient to acquire wealth, that they may return
speedily from what they are apt to confider as a state of exile in
a remote unhealthful country; allured by opportunities too
tempting to be refilled, and reduced by the example of those
around them; find their sentiments of honour and of duty gra-
dually relax. In private life, they give themselves up to a dif-
solute luxury, while in their public conduc they become un-
mindful of what they owe to their sovereign and to their country.

From it an aCtive commercial intercourse began with the Chinese, .--,---
and a considerable number of that indufirious people, allured by
the profpea of gain, fettled in the Philippines under the Spa-
nifh protection. They supplied the colony so amply with all
the valuable productions and manufactures of the Eale, as en-
abled it to open a trade with America, by a course of naviga-
tion, the longest from land to land on our globe. In the in-
fancy of this trade, it was carried on with Callao, on the coast
of Peru; but experience having discovered the impropriety of
fixing upon that as the port of communication with Manila, the
staple of the commerce between the east and wcft was removed
from Callao to Acapulco, on the coast of New Spain.

AFTER various arrangements, it has been brought into a re-

gular form. One or two ships depart annually from Acapulco,
which may carry out filvcr to the amount of live hundred thou-
sand pesos ', but have hardly any thing else of value on board;
in return for which, they bring back spices, drugs, china, and
japan wares, calicoes, chintz, muslins, silks, and every precious
article, with which the benignity of the climate, or the inge-
nuity of its people, has enabled the East to supply the reft of
the world. For some time the merchants of Peru were admitted
to participate in this traffic, and might fend annually a flip to
Acapulco, to wait the arrival of the vefl'ls from Manila, and
receive a proportional share of the commodities which they im-
ported. At length, the Peruvians lwere excluded by mofl rigo-
rous cdiQts, and all the commodities from the lafat reserved
folcly for the consumption of New Spain.

B 0 0 K IN consequence of this indulgence, the inhabitants of that
~< :l country enjoy advantages unknown in the other Spanih co-

lonies. The manufacures of the East are not only more suited
to a warm climate, and more showy than those of Europe, but
can be fold at a lower price; while, at the fame time, the pro-
fits upon them are so considerable, as to enrich all those who are
employed, either in bringing them from Manila, or vending
them in New Spain. As the interest both of the buyer and
feller concurred in favouring this branch of commerce, it has
continued to extend in spite of regulations, concerted with the
most anxious jealousy to circumscribe it. Under cover of what
the laws permit to be imported, vast quantities of India goods
are poured into the markets of New Spain d, and when the flota
arrives at Vera Cruz, it often finds the wants of the people al-
ready supplied by cheaper and more acceptable commodities.

THERE is not, in the commercial arrangements of Spain, any

circumstance more inexplicable than the permission of this trade
between New Spain and the Philippines, or more repugnant to
its fundamental maxim of holding the colonies in perpetual de-
pendance on the mother-country, by prohibiting any commer-
cial intercourse that might suggest to them the idea of re-
ceiving a supply of their wants from any other quarter. This
permission must appear still more extraordinary, from confider-
ing that Spain herself carries on no diredt tiade with her fettle-
ments in the Philippines, and grants a privilege to one of her
American colonies, which she denies to her fubjets in Europe.
It is probable, that the colonifis who originally took poffeflion
of the Philippines, having been sent out from New Spain, be-

gun this intercourse with a country which they confidered, in B o o K
some measure, as their parent state, before the court of Madrid V.
was aware of its consequences, or could eflablifh regulations in
order to prevent it. Many remonstrances have been presented
against this trade, as detrimental to Spain, by diverting into
another channel, a large portion of that treasure which ought to
flow into the kingdom, as tending to give rife to a spirit of in-
dependence in the colonies, and to encourage innumerable
frauds, against which it is impossible to guard, in tranfaAions
so far removed from the infpeaion of government. But as it
requires no flight effort of political wisdom and vigour to abolish
any pradtice, which numbers are interelted in supporting, and to
which time has added the fandion of its authority, the commerce
between New Spain and Manila seems to be as considerable as
ever, and may be confidered as one chief cause of the elegance
and splendor conspicuous in this part of the Spanish dominions.

Bur, notwithstanding this general corruption in the colonies, Public re-

and all the defalcations of the public revenue, by the illicit im- V^ericom
portation of foreign commodities, or by the fraudulent arts of
their own fubjeds, the Spanish monarchs receive a very confider-
able fum from their American dominions. This arises from taxes
of various kinds, which may be divided into three capital
branches. The first contains what is paid to the king, as fove-
reign, or superior lord of the New World : to this class belongs
the duty on the gold and silver raised fiom the mines, and the
tribute exacted from the Indians; the former is termed by the
Spaniards the right of fgniory, the latter is the duty of vafalrage.
The second branch comprehends the numerous duties upon
commerce, which accompany and opprcfs it in every flep of its
progress, from the greatest tranfac-ions of the wholesale mer-

chant,

B 0 0 K chant, to the petty traffic of the vender by retail. The third
'---.- includes what accrues to the king, as head of the church, and

administrator of ecclcfiaftical funds in the New World. In
consequence of this he receives the first-fruits, annats, spoils,
and other spiritual revenues, levied by the apostolic chamber in
Europe; and is entitled, likewise, to the profit arising from the
tale of the bull of Cruzado. This bull, which is published every
two years, contains, an absolution from past offences by the
pope, and, among other immunities, a permission to eat several
kinds of prohibited food, during Lent, and on meagre days.
The monks employed in dispersing those bulls, extol their vir-
tues with all the fervour of interested eloquence; the people,
.ignorant and credulous, liften with implicit assent; and every
person in the Spanish colonies, of European, Creolian, or mixed
race, purchases a bull, which is deemed essential to his falva-
tion, at the rate set upon it by government '.
Its amount. WHAT may be the amount of those various funds, it is

almost impossible to determine with precision. The extent
of the Spanifl dominions in America, the jealousy of go-
vernment, which renders them inaccessible to foreigners, the
mysterious silence which the Spaniards are accustomed to obfcrve
with refpcet to the interior state of their colonies, combine in
covering this subjed with a veil which it is not easy to remove.
But an account, apparently no less accurate, than it is curious,
has lately been publifled of the royal revenue in New Spain,
from which we may form some idea with rcfpefl to what is
colletcd in the other provinces. According to that account,

Sec NOTE C-

the crown does not receive from all the departments of taxation B o0 K.
in New Spain, above a million of our money, from which one ^
half must be deducted as the expence of the provincial elablill-
ment f. Peru, it is probable, yields a fum not inferior to this,
and if we suppose that all the other regions of America, includ-
ing the islands, furnilf a third share of equal value; we mhall
not perhaps be far wide from the truth, if we conclude, that
the net public revenue of Spain, raised in America, does not
exceed a'million and a half sterling. This falls far short of
the immense fums, to which suppositions, founded upon con-
jedure, have raised the Spanish revenue in America .. It is
remarkable, however, upon one account. Spain and Portugal
are the only European powers, who derive a direct revenue
from their colonies, as their quota towards defiaying the general
expence of government. All the advantage that accrues to
other nations, from their American dominions, arises from the
exclusive enjoyment of their trade; but betide this, Spain has
brought her colonies to contribute towards increasing the power
of the state; and in return for protetion, to bear a proportional
share of the common burden.

ACCORDINGLY, what I have computed as the amountof the

S1 anifnl revenue from America, comprehends only the taxes
collcted there, and is far from being the whole of what accrues
to hllc king from his dominions in the New World. The Iheavy
dutics imposed on the commodities exported fromn Spain to
Amnerica ', as well as what is paid by tlioe which fle fends
home in return ; the tax upon the ncgroc-ilavcs, with which

cife extent of which I cannot pretend to ascertain.

Expence of BUT if the revenue which Spain draws from America be
adminiltra-
tion. great, the expence of administration in her colonies bears pro-

portion to it. In every department, even of her domestic po-
lice and finances, Spain has adopted a system more complex,
and more encumbered with a variety of tribunals, and a multi-
tude of officers, than that of any European nation, in which the
sovereign possesses such extensive power. From the jealous fpi-
rit with which Spain watches over her American settlements, and
her endeavours to guard against fraud in provinces so remote
from infpeaion; boards and officers have been multiplied there
with fill more anxious attention. In a country where the ex-
pence of living is great, the salaries allotted to every person in
public office must be high, and muff load the revenue with an
immense burden. The parade of government greatly augments
the weight of it. The viceroys of Mexico, Peru, and the New
Kingdom of Granada, as representatives of the king's person,
among people fond of ofientation, maintain all the slate and
dignity of royalty. Their courts are formed upon the model of
that at Madrid, with horse and foot guards, a household regular-
ly established, numerous attendants, and ensigns of power, dif-
playing such pomp, as hardly retains the agpearance of a dele-
gated authority. All the expence incurred by supporting tile
external and permanent order of government is defrayed by the
crown. The viceroys have befidcs peculiar appbintments suited
to their exalted flation. The salarics fixed by law are indeed
extremely moderate, that of the viceroy of Peru is only thirty
thousand ducats; and that of the viceroy of Mexico, twenty

6 thoulln(l
432

thousand ducats'. Of late, they have been raised to forty 1 0 o K
thoufan d.

THESE salaries, however, constitute but a small part of the

viceroy's revenue. The exercise of an absolute authority ex-
tending to every department of government, and the power of
disposing of many lucrative offices, afford them innumerable op-
portunities of accumulating wealth. To there, which may be
confidered as legal and allowed emoluments, vast Gums are often
added by exactions, which in countries so far removed from the
feat of government, it is not easy to discover, and impossible
to restrain. By monopolizing some branches of commerce, by
a lucrative concern in others, by conniving at the frauds of
merchants, a viceroy may raise such an annual revenue, as no
subject of any European monarch enjoys k. From the single ar-
ticle of presents made to him on the anniversary of his Name-day
(which is always observed as an high festival), I am informed
that a viceroy has been known to receive sixty thousand pesos.
According to a Spanish faying, the legal revenues of a viceroy
are known, his real profits depend upon his opportunities and
his conscience. Sensible of this, the kings of Spain, as I have
formerly observed, grant a commission to their viceroys only for
a few years. This circumstance, however, renders them often
more rapacious, and adds to the ingenuity and ardour wherewith
they labour to improve every moment of power which they
know is hastening fast to a period; and short as its duration
is, it usually affords sufficient time for repairing a Shattered
fortune, or for creating a new one. But even in Situations so try-
ing to human frailty, there are instances of virtue that remains

O UR knowledge of the events which happened in the con-

queRl of New Spain, is derived from sources of information

more original and authentic that that of any tranfacion in the history
of America.. The letters of Cortes to the Emperor Charles V. are
the most valuable of these,: and the first in order of time. As Cortes
early assumed a command independent of Velasquez, it became ne-
ceffary to convey such an account of his operations to Madrid, as.
might procure him the approbation of his sovereign.

THE first of his dispatches has never been made public. It was

sent from Vera-Cruz, July i 6th, 1519.. As I imagined that it might
not reach the Emperor, until he arrived in Germany, for which
he set out early in the year 152o, in order to receive the Imperial
crown; I made diligent search for a copy of this dispatch, both in
Spain and in Germany, but without success. This, however, is of.
less consequence, as it could not contain any thing very material,
being written so soon after Cortes arrived in. New. Spain. But, in
searching for the letter from Corate, a cqpy of one fran the colony

of

ofVera-Cruz to the Emperor has been discovered in the Imperial
library at Vienna. Of this I have subjoined some account at the
close of the Notes to this volume. The second diipatch, dated
Ocober 3oth, I52o, was published at Seville, A. D. I5_2, and the
third and fourth soon after they were received. A Latin translation
of them appeared in Germany, A. D. 1532. Ramuflo soon after
made them more generally known, by inferring them in his valuable
collection. They contain a regular and minute history of the expe-
dition, with many curious particulars concerning the policy and
manners of the Mexicans. The work does honour to Cortes; the
style is simple and perspicuous; but as it was manifestly his interest to
represent his own actions in the fairest light, his victories are probably
exaggerated, his losses diminished, and his acts of rigour and violence
Somewhat softened.

THE next in order is the.Cronica de la Nueva Efpagna, by Francisco

Lopez de Gomara, published A. D. I554. _Gomara's historical merit
is considerable. His mode of narration is clear, flowing, always
agreeable, and sometimes elegant. But he is frequently inaccurate
and credulous; and as he was the domestic chaplain of Cortes after
his return from New Spain, and probably composed his *ork at his
desire, it is manifest that he labours to magnify the merit of his hero,
and to conceal or extenuate such tranfaftions as were unfavourable to
his character. Of this Herrera accuses him in one instance, Dec. ii.
lib. iii. c. 2. and it is not once only that this is conspicuous. Hle
writes, however, with so much freedom concerning several measures
of the Spanifil court, that the copies both of his Hiftoria de las Indias,
and of his Cronica, were called in by a dedree of the council of the
Indies, and they were long confidered as prohibited books in Spain,
though of late licence to print them has been granted. Pinelo
Biblioth. 589.

THE Chronicle of Gomara induced Bernal Diaz del Castillo to corn-
pose his Hiftoria Verdadera de la Conquifta dc la Nueva Efpagna. He

had
438

had been an adventurer in each of the expeditions to New Spain, and
was the companion of Cortes in all his battles and perils. When he
found that neither he himself, nor many of his fellow-foldiers
were once mentioned by Gomara, but that the fame of all their
exploits was ascribed to Cortes; the gallant veteran laid hold of his
pen with indignation, and composed his true history. It contains a
prolix, minute, confused narrative of all Cortes's operations, in such
a rude vulgar style as might be expected from an illiterate soldier.
But as he relates transactions of which lie was witness, and in which
he performed a considerable part, his account bears all the marks of
authenticity, and is accompanied with such a pleasant naivete, with such
interesting details, with such amuting vanity, and yet so pardonable in
an old soldier who had been (as he boasts) in a hundred and nineteen
battles, as renders his book one of the most singular that is to be
found in any language.

PET. Martyr ab Angleria, in a Treatise de Infulis nuper inven-

tis, added to his Decades de rebus Oceanicis & novo orbe, gives
some account of Cortes's expedition. But he proceeds no farther
than to relate what happened after his first landing. This work,
which is brief and flight, seems to contain the information tranfinitted
by Cortes in his first dispatches, embellished with several particulars
communicated to the author by the officers who brought the letters
from Cortes.

BuT the book to which the greater part of modern historians have

had recourse for information concerning the conquest of New Spain,
is Hiftoria de la Conquifta de Mexico, por D. Antonio de Solis, first
publiflhed A. D. 1684. I know no author in any language wholT li-
terary fame has risen so far beyond his real merit. De Solis is reckon-
ed by his countrymen one of the purest writers in the Catlilan tongue;
and if a foreigner may venture to give his opinion concerning a matter
of which Spaniards alone are qualified to judge, le is intitled to that
praise. But, though his language be corrct, his talte in composition

439

is
3

is far from being just. -His periods are so much laboured as to be
often sift, and sometimes tumid; the figures which he employs by
way of ornament, are trite or improper, and his observations superficial.
These blemishes, however, might easily be overlooked, if he were
not defective with refpef to all the great qualities of an historian.
Destitute of that patient industry in research, which conducts to the
knowledge of truth; a stranger to that impartiality which weighs
evidence -vith cool attention, and ever eager to establish his favourite
system of exalting the character of Cortes into that of a perfecR hero,
exempt from error, and adorned with every virtue, he is less solicit-
ous to diicover what was true, than to relate what might appear
splendid. When he attempts any critical difcufflon, his reasonings
are fallacious, and founded upon an imperfea view of facts. Though
he sometimes quotes the difpatcbes of Cortes, he seems not to have
consulted them; and though he sets out with some censure on Gomara,
he frequently prefers his authority, the most doubtful of any, to that
f the other contemporary historians.

BtUT of all the Spanish writers, Herrera furnilthes the fullest and

most accurate information concerning the conquest of Mexico, as well
as every other tranfactioh of America. The industry and attention
with which he consulted not only the books, but the original papers
and public records, which tended to throw any light upon the subjet
of his enquiries, were so great, and he usually judges of the evidence
before him with so much impartiality and candour, that his decads
may be ranked among the most judicious and useful historical collec-
tions. If, by attempting to relate the various occurrences in the New
World in a ftri& chronological order, the arrangement of events in
his work had not been rendered so perplexed, dilconneeted, and ob-
fcure, that it is an unpleasant taflk to colle& from different parts of
his book, and piece together the detached shreds of a story, he might
julfly have been ranked among the molt eminent historians of his
,country. He gives an account of the materials from which he com-
poSed his work, Dec. vi. lib. iii. c. 19.

i N those different conflicts, the Spaniards loft only two men, but

had a considerable number wounded. Though there be no occa-

sion for recourse to any supernatural cause to account either for the
greatness of their victories, or the smallness of their loss; the Spanilh
historians fail not to ascribe both to the patronage of St. Jago, the tu-
telar Saint of their country, who, as they relate, fought at the head
of their countrymen, and by his prowess gave a turn to the fate of
the battle. Gomara is the first who mentions this apparition of St.
James. It is amusing to observe the embarrassment of B. Diaz de Caf-
tillo, occasioned by the struggle between his superstition and his vera-
city. The former disposed him to believe this miracle, the latter re-
itrained him from attesting it. c I acknowledge, fays he, that all
our exploits and victories are owing to our Lord Jesus Christ, and
that in this battle there was such a number of Indians to every one of
us, that if each had thrown a handful of earth they might have buried
us, if by the great mercy of God we had not been proteted. It may
be that the person whom Gomara mentions as having appeared on a
mottled grey horse, was the glorious apostle Signor San Jago or
Signor San Pedro; and that I, as being a finner, was not worthy to
lee him. This I know, that I iaw Francisco de Morla on such a
horse, but as an unworthy transgressor, did not deserve to fee any of
the holy apostles. It may have been the will of God, that it was so
as Gomara relates, but until I read his Chronicle I never heard among
any of the conquerors that such a thing had happened." Cap. 34.

SEVERAL Spanilh historians relate this occurrence in such

terms, as if they wished it should be believed, that the Indians

loaded with the presents, had carried them fromn the capital in the fame

incredible, and Gonara mentions a circumstance which shews, that
nothing extraordinary happened on this occasion. This rich present
had been prepared for Grijalva, when he touched at the fame place
some months before, and was now ready to be delivered, as soon as
Montezuma tent orders for that purpose. Gomara Cron. c. xxvii.

THIS private traffic was directly contrary to the inflruclions of

Velasquez, who enjoined, that whatever was acquired by trade

fliould be thrown into the common flock. But it appears, that the
soldiers had each a private assortment of toys, and other goods pro-
per for the Indian trade, and Cortes gained their favour by encou-
raging this under-hand barter. B. Diaz, c. 41.

which this present consisted. Cron. c. 49. P. Martyr ab Angle-

WTHERE is no circunmfance in the hiflory of the conquest of

America, which is more questionable tlhan the account of the
numerous armies brought into the field against the Spaniards. As the

3 L 2 war

443

war with the Tlafcalans, though of flort duration, was one of the
most considerable which they waged in America, the account given
of their forces merits ibme attention. The only authentic informa-
tion concerning this is derived from three authors. Cortes, in his
second dispatch to the emperor, dated at Segura de la Frontera, Ofto-
ber 30, iSzo, thus estimates the number of their troops in the first
battle 6000oo in the second battle Ioo,ooo; in the third battle
150,000. Relat. ap. Ramus. iii. 228. Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who
was an eye-witness, and engaged in all the actions of this war, thus
reckons their numbers; in the first battle 3000, p. 43; in the ficond
battle 6000oo, ibid. in the third battle 5o,ooo,. p. 45. Gomara, who
was Cortes's chaplain after his return to Spain, and publihfied hi,
Cronica in 1552, follows the computation of Cortes, except in the
second battle, where he reckons the Tlafcalans at 80,ooo, p. 49. It
was manifestly the interest of Cortes to magnify his own dangers and
exploits. For it was only by the merit of extraordinary services, that
he could hope to atone for his irregular condu&, in assuming an in-
dependent command. Bern. Diaz, though abundantly disposed to
place his own prowess, and that of his fellow-conquerors in the most
advantageous point of light, had not the fame temptation to exagge-
rate; and, it is probable, that his account of the numbers approaches
nearer to the truth. The assembling of an army of 50,ooo men re-
quires many previous arrangements, and such provision for their sub-
fiftence as seems to be beyond the foresight of Americans. The degree
of cultivation in Tlafcala does not seem to have been so great, as to have
furnished such a vast army with provisions. Though this province
was so much better cultivated than other regions of New Spain, that
it was called the country of bread; yet the Spaniards in their marcl
Iuffered such want, that they were obliged to"Tubfift upon Tunas, :t

-THESE unhappy vitlims. are said to be persons of diftinltion.
It seems improbable that ib great a number as fifty should be

employed as spies. So many prisoners had been taken and difiniffed,
and the Tlafcalans had sent so many neffages to the Spanifn quarters,
that there appears to be no reason for hazarding the lives of so many
considerable people, in order to procure information about the position
and state of their camp. The barbarous manner in which Cortes treated
a people unacquainted with the laws of war eftabliflied among poll fled
nations, appear so flhocking to the later Spanish writers, that they
diminish the number of those whom he punished so cruelly. Herrera
fays, that he cut off the hands of seven, and the thumbs of some more.
Dec. ii. lib. ii. c. 8. De Solis relates, that the hands of fourteen or
fifteen were cut off, and the thumbs of all the reft. Lib. ii. c. 20.
But Cortes himself, Relat. p. 228, b. and after him Gomara, c. 48,
affirm, that the hands of all the fifty were cut off.

THE horses were objeets of the greatest afroniflmcnt to all the

people of New Spain. At firit they imagined the horse and his

rider, like the Centaurs of the ancients, to be tome monflrous animal
of a terrible form; and supposing, that their food was the iame as that
of men, brought flefli and bread to nourish them. Even after they
discovered their miflake, they believed the horses devoured men in
battle, and when they neighed, thought that they vwre ldemanding
their prey. It was not the intere-st of the Spaniards to undeceive them.

massacre, and it was an aft of wanton cruelty, perpetrated mere-

ly to strike terror into the people of New Spain. Relac. de la De-
ftruyc. p. 17, &c. But the zeal of Las Casas often leads him to ex-
aggerate. In opposition to him Bern. Diaz, c. 83, afTerts, that the
first mifnionaries lent into New Spain by the emperor, made a judicial
inquiry into this tranfadtion; and having examined the priests and
elders of Cholula, found that there was a real conspiracy to cut off
the Spaniards, and that the account given by Cortes was exactly
true. As it was the objeCt of Cortes at that time, and manifestly his
interest, to gain the good-will of Montezuma, it is improbable, that
he would have taken a siep which tended so visibly to alienate him
from the Spaniards, if he had not believed it to be neceflary for his
own preservation. At the fame time, the Spaniards who served in
America had such contempt for the natives, and thought them so
little entitled to the common rights of men, that Cortes might hold
the Cholulans as guilty upon flight and imperfec evidence. The fe-
verity of the punishment was certainly excessive and atrocious.

foldiels on that occasion; " And let it not be tlought strange, hfys

JB Diaz del Castillo gives us some idea of the fatigue and hardships

they underwent in performing this, and other parts of duty.

During the nine months that they remained in Mexico, every man,
without any distinction between officers and soldiers, slept on his arms,
in his quilted jacket and gorget. They lay on mats, or straw spread
on the floor, and each was obliged to hold himfelfas alert as if he
had been on guard. " This, adds he, became so habitual to me, that
even now in my advanced age, I always seep in my cloaths, and
never in any bed. When I visit my Encomienda, I reckon it suitable
to my rank, to have a bed carried along with my other baggage, but
I never go into it; but, according to cultom, I lie in my cloaths, and
walk fi-equently during the night into the open air, to view the stars
as I was wont when in service." Cap. Io8.

and the only cause he assigns for the latter was, that he mighlt meet

the insult offered to that monarch could have no effel but to
irritate him unntcefa-rily. Gomnara fiuppofes, that Cortes had no
other objec than to occupy Montezuma with his own diftcefs and
fuflerings, that he might give less attention to what befcl OQual-
popoca. Cron. c. 89. Herrera adopts the faine opinion. Dec. ii.

If the explanation which I have attempted to give of Cortes's pro-
ceedings on this occasion be not admitted, it appears to me, that they
must be reckoned among the wanton and barbarous ats of oppression
which occur too often in the hiflory of the conquest of America.

NOTE XVI. p. 67.
D E Solis asserts, lib. iv. c, 3. that the proposition of doing homage

to the King of Spain, came fiom Montezuma himself, and was

made in order to induce the Spaniards to depart out of his dominions.
He describes his condua on this occasion, as if it had been founded
-upon a scheme of profound policy, and executed with such refined ad-
dress, as to deceive Cortes himself. But there is no hint or circum-
stance in the contemporary historians, Cortes, Diaz, or Gomara, to
justify this theory. Montezuma, on other occasions, discovered no
such extent of art and abilities. The anguish which he felt in per-
forming this humbling ceremony is natural, if we suppose it to have
been involuntary. But, according to the theory of De Solis, it would
have been preposterous and inconsistent with his own design of deceiv-
ing the Spaniards.

NOTE XVII. p. 69.

N several of the provinces, the Spaniards, wiah all their industry
and influence, could colleCt no gold. In others, they procured

only a few trinkets of finall value. Montezuma assured Cortes, that
the present which he offered to the King of Castile, after doing ho-
mage, consisted of all the treasure amaifed by his father; and told
him, that he had already distributed the reft of his gold and jewels

the silver colle&ted amounted to 500oo Merks. Cron. c. 93. This
agrees with the account given by Cortes, that the royal fifth of silver
was Ioo marks. Relat. 239. B. So that the fum total of silver was
only 4000 ounces, at the rate of eight ounces a mark, which demon-
ftratcs the proportion of silver to gold to have been exceedingly small,

D E Solis, lib. iv. c. i. calls in queffion the truth of this tranfac-

tion, from no better reason than that it was inconfil-cnt with

that prudence which distinguishes the characr of Cortes. But he
ought to have recollected the impetuosity of his zeal at Tlafcala, which
was no less imprudent. I-Ie afierts, that the evidence for it rells upon
the testimony of B. Diaz dcl Caflillo, of Gomara, and of lHerrcra.

according to Herrera, ibid. But P. Martyr, who attended the court
at that time, and communicated every occurrence of moment to his
correspondents day by day, mentions the arrival of these agents, for
the firic time in December, and speaks of it as a recent event. Epift.

firit audience of the Emperor at Tordefillas, when he went to that
town to visit his mother in his way to St. Jago de Compoftella. Her-
rera, dec. ii. lib. v. c. 4. De Solis, lib. iv. c. 5. But the emperor set
out from Valladolid for Tordefillas, on the I ith of March 5 20; and

Cuba in April 1520. It is manifest then, that Velasquez could not
receive any account of what paired in this interview at Tordefillas, pre-
vious to his hostile preparations against Cortes. His real motives
seem to be those which I have mentioned. The patent appointing him

November 13, 1519. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. iii .

the three deserters who joined Narvaez a&ed as interpreters, having
acquired a competent knowledge of the language, c. I Io. With his
tfual minuteness, he mentions their names and characters, and relates,
in chapter 122, how they were punished for their perfidy. The Spa-
niards had now resided above a year among the Mexicans; and it is
not surprising, that several among them should have made some profi-
ciency in speaking their language. This seems to have been the cafe.
Herrera, dec. ii. lib. x. c. i. Both B. Diaz, who was present, and
Herrera, the most accurate and best informed of all the Spanish wri-
ters, agree with Cortes in his account of the secret correspondence
carried on with Montezuma. Dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 18, 19. De Solis
seems to confider it as a discredit to Cortes, his hero, that Monte-
zuma should have been ready to engage in a correspondence with Nar-
vaez. He supposes that monarch to have contracted such a wonder-
ful affection for the Spaniards, that he was not Solicitous to be deli-
vered from them. After the indignity with which he had been treat-
ed, such an affect-ion is incredible; and even De Solis is obliged to ac-
knowledge, that it must be looked upon as one of the miracles which
God had wrought to facilitate the conquest, lib. iv. c. 7. The truth
is, Montezuma, however much overawed by his dread of the Spa-
niards, was extremely impatient to recover his liberty.

juncture, to conceal from the court of Spain the full extent of the loss
which he had sustained. De Solis, always studious to diminish every
misfortune that besel his countrymen, rates their loss at about two
hundred men. Lib. iv. c. 19. B. Diaz affirms, that they loft 870

Palafox, bishop of Los Angeles, who seems to have inquired into the

their loss. Virtudes del Indio, p. 22. Gomara flates their loss at
450 men. Cron. c. o09. Some months afterwards, when Cortes had re-
ceived several reinforcements, he mustered his troops, and found them
to be only 590. Relat. ap. Ramus. iii. p. 255, E. Now, asNarvaez
brought 880 men into New Spain, and about 400 of Cortes's soldiers
were then alive, it is evident, that his loss in the retreat from Mexico
must have been much more considerable than what he mentions. B. Diaz,
solicitous to magnify the dangers and sufferings to which he and his
fellow-conquerors were exposed, may have exaggerated their loss;
but, in my opinion, it cannot well be estimated at lets than 600oo men.

my companions opened, their hearts yet fluttering, offered to an ac-
cursed idol, and their flesh devoured by their exulting enemies; I was
accustomed to enter a battle not only without feat, but with high
spirit. But from that time I never advanced to fight the Mexicans
without a secret horror and anxiety, my heart trembled at the thoughts
of the death which I had seen them fuifer." He takes care to add, that
as soon as the combat began, his terror went off; and, indeed, his ad-
venturous bravery on every occasion is full evidence of this. B. Diaz,

NOTE XXV. p. I25.
O NE circumstance in this siege merits particular notice. The ac-

count which the Spanifl writers give of the numerous armies

employed in the attack or defence of Mexico, seems to be incredible.
According to Cortes himlelf, he had at one time 15o,ooo auxiliary
Indians in his service. Relat. Ramui. iii. 275, E. Gomara asserts,
that they were above 200,000. Cron. c. i I-6. errera, an author of
higher authority, fays, they were about 2oo,ooo. Dec. iii. lib. i.
c. 19. None of the contemporary writers ascertain explicitly the
number of persons in VMexico during the siege. But Cortes on several
occasions mentions the number of Mexicans who were slain, or who
perished for want of food ; and, if we may rely on those circumlatnccs,
it is probable, that above two hundred thoulin]d mullf have been fliut
up in the town. But the quantity of provisions neccefir-y for the fitb-
fitence of' ich vast multitudes assembled in one place during three
months is so great, and it requires so much foresight and arrangement
to collec thcfe, and lay them up in magazines, so as to be certain of
a regular supply, that one can hardly believe that this could be acconm-
pliflled in a country where agriculture was lb imperfecd as in the Mex-
ican empire, where there were no tame animals, and by a people na-

turally

453

turally so improvident, and so incapable of executing a complicated
plan as the most improved Americans. The Spaniards, with all their
care and attention, fared very poorly, and were often reduced to ex-
treme difrefs from want of provisions. B. Diaz, p. 142. Cortes Relat.
27 I, D. Cortes on one occasion mentions sightly the subsistence of his
army; and after acknowledging, that they were often in great want,
adds, that they received supplies from the people of the country, of
fifi, and of some fruit, which he calls the cherries of the country,
Ibid. B. Diaz fays, that they had cakes of maize, and cerafas de la
tierra; and when the season of these was over, another fruit, which
he calls Tunas; but their most comfortable subsistence was a root
which the Indians use as food, to which he gave the name of ,uilites,
p. 142. The Indian auxiliaries had one means of subsistence more than
the Spaniards. They fed upon the bodies of the Mexicans whom they
killed in battle. Cort. Relat. 176, C. B. Diaz confirms his relation,
and adds, that when the Indians returned from Mexico to their own
country, they carried with them large quantities of the fiefh of the
Mexicans faked or dried, as a most acceptable present to their friends,
that they might have the pleasure of feeding upon the bodies of their
enemies in their festivals. P. I57. De Solis, who seems to confider
it as an imputation of discredit to his countrymen, that they fliould
aa in concert with auxiliaries who fed upon human flefih, is solicitous
to prove, that they endeavour to prevent their associates from eating
the bodies of the Mexicans, lib. v. c. 24. But he has no authority
for this from the original historians. Neither Cortes himself, nor B.
Diaz, seem to have had any fucl scruple; and, on many occasions,
mention the Indian repasts, which were become familiar to them, with-
out any mark of abhorrence. Even with this additional stock of food
for the Indians, it was hardly poflible to procure subsistence for armies
amounting to such numbers as we find in the Spanifli writers. Per-
haps the best solution of the difficulty is, to adopt the opinion of B.
Diaz del Caltillo, the most artless of all the HfiJloriadoresprimitivos.
"When Gomara, fays he, on fomre occasions relates, that there were

so
45+

# NOTE XXVI. p. 138.

so many thousand Indians our auxiliaries, and on others, that there
were so many thousand houses in this or that town, no regard is to be
paid to his enumeration, as he has no authority for it, the numbers
not being in reality the fifth of what he relates. If we add together
the different numbers which he mentions, that country would contain
more millions than there are in Castile." C. 129. But though some
considerable deduction should certainly be made fiom the Spanish ac-
counts of the Mexican forces; they must have been very numerous,
for nothing but an immense superiority in number, could have en-
abled them to withstand a body of nine hundred Spaniards, con-
duEted by a leader of fich abilities as Cortes,

IN relating the oppressive and cruel proceedings of the conquerors

of New Spain, I have not followed B. de las Casas as my guide.

exaggerated. It is from the testimony of Cortes himfelfand ofGomara,

contrary to the teltiniony of the original historians, particularly of

lated by the moll- authentic of the Spanifli writers. Torquemada has
extracted fromn a hilory of Tczcuco, compoled in the Mexican tongue,.

that of the Spanifil authors. Mon. Indiana, i. 575. According to the

such a wanton a&d of cruelty. B. Diaz affirms,, that Guatimozin and his

H E motive for undertaking this expedition was, to punish Chris-
toval de Olid, one of his officers, who had revolted againif him,

and aimed at establishing an independent jurifdi&ion. Cortes regard-
ed this insurrection as of such dangerous example, and dreaded so
much the abilities and popularity of its author, that in person he led
the body of troops destined to suppress it. He marched, according
to Gomara, three thousand miles, through a country abounding with
thick fcrefts, rugged mountains, deep rivers, thinly inhabited, and
oultivated only in a few places. What he fuffcred from famine, from
the hostility of the natives, fiom the climate, and from hardships of
every species, has nothing in history parallel to it, but what occurs in
the adventures of the other discoverers and conquerors of the New
World. Cortes was employed in this dreadful service above two
years, and though it was not diflinguifhed by any splendid event, he
exhlibitcd, during the course of it, greater personal courage, more for-
titude of mind, more perseverance and patience, than in any other
period or scene in his life. Herrera, dec. iii. lib. vi. vii. viii. ix.
Gomara Cron. c. 163-177. B. Diaz, 174-190. Were one to write
a life of Cortes, the account of this expedition flould occupy a splendid
place in it. In a general history of America, as the expedition was
producive of no great event, the mention of it is fufficicnt.

before related, the fum divided among the conquerors on the first

reason for fufpecing that the accusations of Cortes's enemies were not
altogether destitute of foundation. They charged him with having
unjuffly applied to his own use a disproportionate share of the Mexican
spoils; with having concealed the royal treasures of Montezuma and
Guatimozin, with defrauding the king of his fifth, and robbing his
followers of what was due to them. Herrera, dec. iii. lib. viii. c. i5.

IN tracing theprogrefs of the Spanifl arms in New Spain, we have

followed Cortes himself as our most certain guide. His dispatches

to the emperor contain a minute account of his operations. But the
unlettered conqueror of Peru was incapable of relating his own ex-
ploits. Our information with refpe&t to them, is derived however
from contemporary and respectable authors.

THE most early account of Pizarro's tranfaEtions in Peru, was pub-

lifhed by Francisco de Xerez, his secretary. It is a simple unadorned
narrative, carried down no farther than the death of Atahualpa, in
1533; for the author returned to Spain in 1534, and soon after he
landed, printed at Sevile his short History of the Conquest of Peru,
addressed to the emperor.

DON Pedro Sancho, an officer who served under Pizarro, drew up

an account of his expedition, which was translated into Italian by
Ramufio, and inserted in his valuable collection, but has never been
publilhed in its original language. Sancho returned to Spain at the

VOL. II. 3 N fame

457

fame time with Xerez. Great credit is due to what both those authors
relate concerning the progress and operations of Pizarro, but the re-
fidence of the Spaniards in Peru had been so short, at the time when.
they left it, and their intercourse with the natives so slender, that their
knowledge of the Peruvian manners and customs is very imperfect.

THE next contemporary historian is Pedro Cieza de Leon, who

published his Cronica del Peru, at Seville in 1553. If he had
finished all that he proposes in the general divi-sion of his work, it
would have been the most complete hiltory which had been published
of any region in the New World. He was well qualified to execute it,,
having served during seventeen years in America, and visited in per-
son most of the provinces concerning which he had occasion to Write.
But only the first part of his Chronicle has been printed. It contains
a. description of Peru, and several of the adjacent provinces, with an
account of the institutions and customs of the natives,. and is written
with so little art, and such an apparent regard for truth, that one must
regret the loss of the other parts of his work.

TH-IS' loss is amply supplied by Don Augustine Zarate, who pib-lifh-

ed, ini r55,, his Hiftoria del defcubrimiento y Conquefta de la Pro-
vincia del Peru. Zarate was a man of rank and education,. and em--
ployed in Peru as comptroller-general of the public revenue. His
history, whether we attend to its matter or composition, is a book of'
considerable merit; as he had opportunity to be well inforrhed, and
seems to have been inquisitive with refpe& to the' mann'ers-and tranfac-.
tions of the Peruvians, great credit is due to his teftimtny.

DON Diego Fernandez published his Hift-oia clel Peru in 1571.

Hlis ole objet is to relate the dissensions and civil wars of the Spaniards
in that empire. As he served in a public ifation in Peru, and was well
acquainted both with the country;, and with the principal actors in
those fingulir scenes whicl he describes, as' he p6ffeffed found under-
ftarding, and great impartiality, his.work inay be ranked among those

3 of
4S3

-of the historians most diftinguifled for their industry in research, or
their capacity in judging with refpe&t to the events which they relate.

THiE last author who can be reckoned among the contemporary

historians of the conquest of Peru, is Garcilaio de la Vega, Inca. For
though the first part of his work, intitled, Commnentarios Reales del Ori-
gen de los Incas Reies del Peru, was not publithed sooner than the year
I609, feventy-fix years after the death of Atahualpa the last emperor,
yet as he was born in Peru, and was the son of an officer of diftintion
among the Spaniih conquerors, by a Coya, or lady of the royal race,
on account of which he always took the name of Inca, as lie was maf-
ter of the language spoken by the Incas, and acquainted with the tra-
ditions of his countrymen, his authority is rated very high, and often
placed above that of all the other historians. His work, however, is
little more than a commentary upon the Spanifl writers of the Peru-
vian story, and composed of quotations taken from the authors whom
I have mentioned. This is the idea which he hilmfelfgives ofit, Lib. i.
c. Io. Nor is it in the account of facls only that he follows them ser-
vilely. Even in explaining the institutions and rites of his ancestors,
his information seems not to be more perfet than theirs. His explana-
tion of the Quipos is almost the lame with that of Acofta. He pro-
duces no specimen of Peruvian poetry, but that wretched one which
he borrows from Bias Valera, an early miflionary, whose memoirs
have never been publiflhed.' Lib. ii. c. 15. As for composition, ar-
rangement, or a capacity of diitinguifiing between what is fabulous,
what is probable, and what is true, one tiarches for them in vain in
the commentaries of the Inca. His work, however, notwithstanding
its great defects, is not altogether destitute of use. Some traditions
which he received from his countrymen are prlcfirved in it. -His
knowledge of the Peruvian language has enabled him to corrd ect lil
errors of the Spanish writers, and lie has inserted in it some curious
facts taken from authors whose works were never published, and ;u-e
now loft.

O N E may form an idea both of the hardships which they endured,

and of the sickliness of the regions which they visited, from the

extraordinary mortality that prevailed among them. Pizarro carried

died. Few fell by the sword; most of them were cut off by diseases.

IN the year 1740, D. Ant. Ulloa, and D. George Juan, travelled

H I S extravagant and unseasonable discourse of Valverde has been
censured by all historians, and with juifice. But though he seems

to have been an illiterate and bigotted monk, nowise resembling the
good Olmedo, who accompanied Cortes; the absurdity of his address
to Atahualpa must not be charged wholly upon him. His harangue
is evidently a translation, or paraphrase of that form, concerted by a
junto of Spanish divines and lawyers in the year i og, for explaining
the right of their king to the sovereignty of the New World, and for
direcing the officers employed in America how they fliould take pof-
feflion of any new country. See Vol. i. Note xxiii. The sentiments con-
tained in Valverde's harangue mufft not then be imputed to the bigot-
ted imbecillity of a particular man, but to that of the age. Gomara
and Benzoni relate one circumstance concerning Valverde, which, if
authentic, renders him an object not of contempt only, but of horror.
They assert, that during the whole action, Valverde continued to ex-
cite the soldiers to slaughter, calling to them to strike the enemy not
with the edge, but with the points of their swords. Goe. Cron.

very different fiom that of the Roman Catholic clergy in other parts
of America, where they uniformly exerted their influence to protect
the Indians, and to moderate the ferocity of their countrymen.

TWO different systems have been formed concerning the condua

of Atahualpa. The Spanifh'writers, in order to justify the vio-

*lence of their countrymen, contend, that all the Inca's profeflions of
friendflfip were feigned; and that his intention in agreeing to an inter-
view with Pizarro at Caxamalca, was to cut off him and his followers
at one blow; that for this purpose he advanced with 4uch a nume-
.rous body of attendants, who had arms concealed under their garments
to execute this scheme, This is the account given by Xerez and Za-
rate, and adopted by Herrera. But if it had been the plan of the Inca
to destroy the Spaniards, one can hardly imagine that he would have
permitted them to march unmolested through the desert of Motupe,
or have negleted to defend the paies in the mountains, where they
,might have been attacked with so much advantage. If the Peruvians
marched to Caxamalca with an intention to fall upon the Spaniards, it
is inconceivable, that of so great a body of men, prepared for action, not
one should attempt to make resistance, but all tamely susser themselves
to be butchered by an enemy whom they were armed to attack. Ata-
hualpa's mode of advancing to the interview, has the afpe& of a
peaceable proceflion, not of a military enterprize. He himself, and
his followers were, in their habits of ceremony, preceded, as on days
.of solemnity, by unarmed harbingers. Though rude nations are fre-
quently cunning and false, yet, if a scheme of deception and treachery
,muit be imputed either to a monarch, that had no great reason to be
alarmed at a visit from strangers who solicited admission into his pre-
fence as friends, or to an adventurer so daring, and so little fcrupu-
lous as Pizarro, one cannot hesitate in determining where to fix the
presumption of guilt. Even amidfi the endeavours of the Spani'sh
writers to palliate the proceedings of Pizarro, one plainly perceives,
that it was his intention, as well as his intcreit, to seize the Inca, and
that he had taken nmcafu-es for that purpofie, previous to any suspicion
of that monarch's dcligns.

'GAR CILLASSO
.462

GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA, extremely solicitous to vindicate his coun-

trymen, the Peruvians, from the crime of having concerted the deftruc-
tion of Pizarro and his followers, and no less afraid to charge the Spa-
niards with improper condut towards the Inca, has framed another
fyfIem. He relates, that a man of majestic form with a long beard,
and garments reaching to the ground, having appeared in vi/ion to
Viracocha, the eighth Inca, and declared, that he was a child of the
Sun, that monarch built a temple in honour of this perfon,t and ere&-
ed an image of him,? resembling as nearly as possible the singular
form in which he had exhibited himself to his view. In this temple,.
divine honours were paid to him, by the name of Viracocha. P. i.
lib. iv. c. 2I.. lib. v. c.. 22. When the Spaniards first appeared
in Peru, the length of their beards, and the dress they wore, struck
every person so much with their likeness to the image of Viracocha,.
that they supposed them to be children of the Sun, who had descended
from heaven to earth. All concluded, that the fatal period of the Pe-
ruvian empire was now approaching, and that the throne would be oc-
cupied by new poffeflors. Atahualpa liimfelf, confidering the Spa-
niards as messengers from heaven, was.fo far fiom entertaining any
thoughts of resisting them, that he determined to yield implicit obedi-
ence to their commands. From those sentiments flowed his profeflions
of love and refpeSt. To those were owing the cordial reception of
Soto and Ferdinand Pizarro in his camp, and the submissive reverence
with which he himself advanced to visit the Spanilh general in his
quarters,, but from the gross ignorance of Philipillo, the interpreter,
the declaration of the Spaniards and his answer to it, were ib ill ex-
plained, that by their mutual inability to comprehend each other's in-
tentions, the fatal rencounter at Caxamalca, with all its dreadful con-
sequences, was occasioned.

IT is remarkable, that no traces of this fupertitiouss veneration of

the Peruvians for the Spaniards, ar- to be found cither in Xerez, or
Sancho, or Zarate, previous to the interview at C.ixamalca; and yec
die two.former served under Pizarro at that time, and tle latter visited

46,%,

Peru soon after after the cnnqueft. If either the Inca himself, or his
messengers, had addressed the Spaniards in the words which Garcilaffo
puts in their mouths, they must have been struck with such submissive
declarations; and they would certainly have availed themselves of
them to accomplish their own designs with greater facility. Garcilaffo
himself, though his narrative of the intercourse between the Inca and
Spaniards preceding the rencounter at Caxamalca, is founded on the
supposition of his believing them to be Viracochas, or divine beings.
P. ii. lib. i. c. 17, &c. yet with his usual inattention and inaccuracy
he admits, in another place, that the Peruvians did not recollea the
resemblance between them and the god Viracocha, until the fatal difaf-
ters subsequent to the defeat at Caxamalca, and then only began to call
them Viracochas. P. i. lib. v. c. 21. This is confirmed by Herrera,
dec. v. lib. ii. c. 12. In many different parts of America, if we may
believe the Spanish writers, their countrymen were confidered as divine
beings who had descended from Heaven. But in this inflance, as in
many which occur in the intercourse between nations, whose progress
in refinement is very unequal, the ideas of those who used the expref-
sion, were different from the ideas of those who heard it. For, such
is the idiom of the Indian languages, or such is the simplicity of those
who speak them, that when they fee any thing with which they were
formerly unacquainted, and of which they do not know the origin;
they fay, that it came down from Heaven. Nugnez. Ram. iii.

THE account which I have given of the sentiments and proceedings

of the Peruvians, appears to be more natural and consistent than either
of the two preceding, and is better supported by the facas related by the
contemporary historians.

AccORDING to Xerez, p. 200, two thousand Peruvians were killed.

Sancho makes the number of the f(ain fix or seven thousand. Ram. iii.

N O T HING can be a more striking proof of this, than that three

Spaniards travelled from Caxamalca to Cuzco. The distance be-

tween them is fix hundred miles. In every place throughout this vafr
extent of country, they were treated with all the honours which the
Peruvians paid to their sovereigns, and even to their divinities. Under
pretext of armafing what was wanting for the ransom of the Inca, they
demanded the plates of gold with which the walls of the Temple of the
Sun in Cuzco were adorned; and though the priests were unwilling to
alienate those sacred ornaments, and the people refused to violate the
shrine of their God, the three Spaniards with their own hands robbed
the Temple of part of this valuable treasure; and such was the re-
verence of the natives for their persons, that though they beheld this
aft of sacrilege with aftonifhmenr, they did not attempt to prevent
or disturb the comminlion of it. Zarate, lib. ii. c. 6. Sancho ap.

But as the general, and other officers, were entitled to a part far greater
than that of the private men, the fim total muff have risen much be-
yond what I have mentioned. Gomara, c. 123. and Zarate, lib. ii.

p. 375, this weapon is common among several barbarous tribes to-
wards the extremity of South America; and it is more probable, that
the Peruvians had observed the dexterity with which they used it in
hunting, and on this occasion adopted it themselves. The Spaniards
were considerably annoyed by it. Herrera, ibid. Another instance
of the ingenuity of the Peruvians deserves mention. By turning a
river out of its channel, they overflowed a valley, in which a body
of the enemy was posted, so suddenly, that it was with the tmnoft
difficulty the Spaniards made their escape. Herrera, dec. v. lib. viii.

and apparently the most accurate. It was probably taken from

ed. His navigation down the Coca, or Napoo, begun early in
February I541; and he arrived at the mouth of the river on the 26th
of August, having spent near seven months in the voyage. M. de la
Condamine, in the year 1743, failed from Cuenca to Para, a fettle-
ment of the Portuguese at the mouth of the river, a navigation much
longer than that of Orellana, in less than four months. Voyage,
p. 179. But the two adventurers were very differently provided for
the voyage. This hazardous undertaking, to which ambition prompted
Orellana, and to which the love of science led M. de la Condamine,
was undertaken in the year 1769, by Madame Godin des Odonais,
fi-om conjugal affection. The narrative of the hardflips which she sus-
sered, of the dangers to which flhe was exposed, and of the difaflers
which besel her, is one of the mote singular and aflicRing stories in

lodged in the fame house, and having but one cloak among them, it
was worn alternately by him who had occasion to appear in public,
while the reft, from the want of a decent dress, were obliged to keep
within doors. Their former friends and companions were so much
afraid of giving offence to Pizarro, that they durst not entertain,
or even converse with them. One may conceive what was the condi-
tion, and what the indignation of men once accustomed to power and
opulence, when they felt themselves poor and despised, without a
roof under which to shelter their heads, while they beheld others,

-ver the mode of levying tribute from his Indian fubjefts, that would
be most beneficial to the crown, and least oppressive to them, addressed
a mandate to all the Courts of Audience in America, enjoining them
to answer certain queries which he proposed to them, concerning the
ancient form of government established among the various nations of
Indians, and the mode in which they paid taxes to their kings
or chiefs. In obedience to this mandate, Corita, who had resided
nineteen years in America, fourteen of which he paired in New Spain,
composed the work of which I have a copy. He acquaints his so-
vereign, that he had made it an object during his residence in America,
and in all its provinces which he had visited, to inquire diligently into
the mann'ers and customs of the natives, that he had converted for
this purpose with many aged and intelligent Indians, and consulted fe-
veral of the Spanish ecclesiastics, who understood the Indian languages
most- perfetly, particularly some of those who landed in New Spain
soon after the conquest. Corita appears to be a man of some learning,
and to have carried on his inquiries with the diligence and accuracy to
which he pretends. Greater credit is due to his testimony from one
circumstance. His work was not composed with a view to publica-
tion, or in support of any particular theory, but contains simple, though
full answers to queries proposed to him officially. Though Herrera
does not mention him among the authors whom he had followed as
guides in his history, I should suppose, from several saCs of which he
takes notice, as well as from several expressions which he uses, that
this memorial of Corita was not unknown to him.

T is to P. Torribio de Benavente, that I am indebted for this curi-
ous observation. Pa!afox, bilop of Ciudad de la Puebla Los Angeles,

confirms and illustrates it more fully. The Mexican (fays he) is the
only language in which a termination indicating respect, filavas reve-
rentiales y de cortefia, may be affixed to every word. By adding the
final syllable zin, or azin to any word, it becomes a proper expreflion
of veneration in the mouth of an inferior. If, in speaking to an equal,
the word Father is to be used, it is Tat/, but an inferior fays Tatzin.
One priest speaking to another, calls him Teopixque; a perlon of inferior
rank calls him Teopixcatzin. The name of the emperor who reigned
when Cortes invaded Mexico, was Moniezurna, but his vafflEs, fiomn
reverence, pronounced it ollonezumnazin. Torribio, MS. Palaf. Vir-
tudcs del Indio, p. 65. The Mexicans had not only reverential nouns,.
but reverential verbs. The manner in which these are formed from
the verbs in common ulie, is explained by D. Jol. Aug. Aldamna y
Guevara in his Mexican Grammar, N°. 188.

FRO M comparing several passages in Corita and Herrera, we may

collect with some degree of accuracy, the various modes in which

tie Mexicans contributed towards the support of government. Some
persons of the sirs order seem to have been exempted from the payment
of any tribute, and as their only duty to the public, were bound to
personal service in war, and to follow the banner of the sovereign with
their vassals. 2. The immediate vassals of the crown were bound not
only to personal military service, but paid a certain proportion of the
produce of their lands in kind. 3. Those who held offices of honour
or trust, paid a certain Ihare of what they received in consequence of
holding these. 4. Each Capulld, or association, cultivated some part
of the common field allotted to it, for the behoof of the crown, and
depDfited the produce in the royal granaries. 5. Some part of what-
ever was brought to the public markets, whether fruits of the earth,
or the various productions of their artists and manufactures, was de-
manded for the public use, and the merchants who paid this were
exempted from every other tax. 6. The Mayeques, or adfcripti glebe,
were bound to cultivate certain districts in every province, which may
be confidered as crown lands, and brought the increase into public
itorehoufes. Thus the sovereign received some part of whatever was
useful or valuable in the country, whether it was the natural produc-
tion of the foil, or acquired by the industry of the people. What each
contributed towards the support of government, seems to have been
inconsiderable. Corita, in answer to one of the queries put to the
Audience of Mexico by Philip II. endeavours to estimate in money
the value of what each citizen might be supposed t2 pay, and does
not reckon it at more than three or four reals, about eighteen pence or
two shillings a head.

ter the city, are conduEted two conduits, composed of clay tempered
with mortar, about two paces in breadth, and raised about fix feet.
In one of them is conveyed a stream of excellent water, as large as the
body of a man, into the centre of the city, and it supplies all the inha-
bitants plentifully. The other is empty, that when it is necessary to
clean, or repair the former, the stream of water may be turned into it.
As this conduit passes along two of the bridges, where there are breacheS
in the causeway, through which the salt-water of the lake flows, it is
conveyed over them in pipes as large as the body of an ox, then
carried from the conduit to the remote quarters of the city in canoes,
and fold to the inhabitants. Relat. ap. Ramus. 241, A.

IN the armoury of the royal palace of Madrid, are shewn suits of

armour, which are called Montezuma's. They are composed of

thin lacquered copper-plates. In the opinion of very intelligentjudges
they are evidently eastern. The forms of the silver ornaments upon
them, representing dragons, &c. may be confidered as a confirmation of
this. They are infinitely superior in point ofworkmanfhip to any effort
of American art. The Spaniards probably received them from the Phi-
lippine islands. The only unquestionable specimen of Mexican art that
I know of in Great Britain, is a cup of very fine gold, which is said to
have belonged to Montezuma. It weighs 5 oz. i2 dwt. Three
drawings of it were exhibited to the Society of Antiquar-ies, June Io,
1765. A man's head is represented on this cup. On one fide the full
face, on the other the profile, on the third the back parts of the head.
The relievo is said to have been produced by pulnching the inside of the
cup, so as to make the reprcfcntation of a face on the outside. The
features are rude, but very tolerable, and certainly too i-tude for Spa-
nifli workmanflhip. This cup w:is purchallld by E;:dwarld cirt of Or-

I am indebted for this information to my refpe&able and ingenious
friend Mr. Barrington.

NOTE LIV. p. 290.
T H E learned reader will perceive how much I have been indebted,

in this part of my work, to the guidance of the bishop of Glou-

cefter, who has traced the successive steps, by which the human mind
advanced in this line of its progress, with much erudition, and greater
ingenuity. He is the first, as far as I know, who formed a rational and
confiffent theory concerning the various modes of writing prafcifed by
nations, according to the various degrees of their improvement. Div.
Legation of Moses, iii. 69, &c. Some important observations have
been added by the learned and intelligent author of the Traite de la
Formation Mechanique des Langues, tom. i. 295, &c.

As the Mexican paintings are the most curious monuments extant

of the earliest mode of writing, it will not be improper to give some
account of the means by which they were preserved from the general
wreck of every work of art in America, and communicated to the
Public. For the most early and complete collection of these publish-
ed by Purchas, we are indebted to the attention of that curious in-
quirer, Hakluyt. Don Antonio Mendoza, viceroy of New Spain, hav-
ing deemed those paintings a proper present for Charles V. the ship
in which they were sent to Spain, was taken by a French cruizer, anld
they came into the pofleffion of Thevet, the king's geographer, who
having travelled himself into the New World, and described one of
its provinces, was a curious observer of whatever tended to illuftrafe
the manners of the Americans. On his death, they were purchased by
-Iakluyt, at that time chaplain of the Englilh ambassador to the
French court; and, being left by him to Purchas, were publifled at
the delire of the learned antiquary Sir Henry Spelman. Purchas, iii.
o165.

THE second specimen of Mexican picure-writing, was published by
Dr. Francis Gemelli Carreri, in two copper-plates. The firlt is a map,

5 or
474

or representation of the progress of the ancient Mexicans on their first
arrival in the country, and of the various fiations in which they fettled,
before they founded the capital of their empire in the lake of Mexico.
The second is a Chronological Wheel, or Circle, representing the man-
ner in which they computed and marked their cycle of fifty-two years.
The former was given to him by Dr. Chriftoval de Guadalajora, in the
city of de la Puebla de los Angeles; the latter he received from Don
Carlos de Siguenza y Gongorra. But as it leems now to be a received
opinion (founded I know not on what evidence) that Carreri was never
out of Italy, and that his famous Giro del Mundo, is an account of a
fictitious voyage, I have not mentioned these paintings in the text.
They have, however, manifestly the appearance of being Mexican pro-
ductions, and are allowed to be so by Boturini, who was well qua-
lified to determine whether they were genuine or futppofititious. The
fcyle of painting in the former is considerably more perse&, than
any other specimen of Mexican design; but as the original is said to have
been much defaced by time, I fufpeat that it has been improved by
some touches from the hand of an European artist. Carreri, Churchill,
iv. p. 487. The chronological wheel is ajuft delineation of the Mexi-
can mode of computing time, as described by Acofta, lib. vi. c. 2. It
seems to resemble one which that learned Jesuit had seen; and if it be
admitted as a genuine monument, it proves that the Mexicans had
artificial, or arbitrary charaaters; which represented several things
betides numbers. Each month is there represented by a symbol ex-
preffive of some work or rite peculiar to it.

THE third specimen of Mexican painting was dilcovered by another

Italian. In 1736, Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci fct out for New Spain,
and was led by several incidents to study the language of the Mexicans,
and to collect the remains of their hif-orical monuments. He per-sis-
ed nine years in his researches, with the entliufiafm of a projector, and
the patience of an antiquary. In 1746, he publiihed at Madrid, Idea
de una Nueva Hifloria General de la Aimercica Septenirioonl, containing an
account of the refilt of his inquiries; and he added to it a catalogue of

3 P] 2 his

475

his American Historical Museum, arranged under thirty-fix different
heads. His idea of a New History appears to me the work of a whim-
fical credulous man. But his catalogue of Mexican maps, paintings,
tribute-rolls, calendars, &c. is amazing. Unfortunately a ship, in
which he had sent a considerable part of them to Europe, was taken
by an English privateer in the war before last; and it is probable that
they perished by falling into the hands of ignorant captors. Boturini
himself incurred the displeasure of the Spanish court, and died in an
hospital at Madrid. The history, of which the Idea, &c. was only a
profpeftus, was never published. The remainder of his Museum seems
to have been dispersed. Some part of it came into the pofieffion of the
present archbishop of Toledo, when he was primate of New Spain, and
he published from it that curious tribute-roll which I have mentioned.

THE only other collection of Mexican paintings, as far as I can learn,

is in the Imperial Library at Vienna. By order of their Imperial Ma-
jefties, I have obtained such a specimen of there as I desired, in eight
paintings, made with so much fidelity, that I am informed the copies
could hardly be diftinguilhed from the originals. According to a note
in this Co.de. Mexiicaeus, it appears to have been a present from Em-
manuel King of Portugal to Pope Clement VII. who died A. D.
1533. After pafling through the hands offeveral illustrious proprie-
tors, it fell into those of the cardinal of Saxe-Eifenach, who present-
ed it to the emperor Leopold. These paintings are manifestly Mexi-
can, but they are in a fryle very different from any of the former. An
engraving has been made of one of them, in order to gratify such of
my readers, as may deem this an objet worthy of their attention.
Were it an objet of sufficient importance, it might, perhaps, be
possible, by recourse to the plates of Purchas, and 4he archbilhop of
Toledo, as a key, to form plausible conjectures concerning the
meaning of this picture. Many of the figures are manifecfly fimi-
lar. A. A. are targets and darts, almost in the fame form with those
publifled byPurchas, p. 1070, 1071, &c. B. B. are figures of tem-
ples, nearly resembling those in Purchas, p. 1 109 and 1 1 13, and in

mode of noting numbers occurs frequently. D. D. D. &c. Accord-
ing to Boturini, the mode of computation by the number of knots,
was known to the Mexicans as well as to the Peruvians, p. 85, and the
manner in which the number of units is represented in the Mexican
paintings in my potfeflion, seems to confirm this opinion. They plainly
resemble a string of knots on a cord or slender rope.

Since I publifled the former Edition, Mr. Waddilove, who is still

pleased to continue his friendly attention to procure me information,
has discovered, in the Library of the Escurial, a volume in folio,
confifing of forty sheets of a kind of pasteboard, each the size of a
common flieet of writing paper, with great variety of uncouth and
whimsical figures of Mexican painting, in very fresh colours, and
with an explanation in Spanifl to most of them. The firfr twenty-
two sheets are the signs of the months, days, &c. About the middle
of each meet are two or more large figures for the month, surrounded
by the signs of the days. The last eighteen Iheets are not so filled
with figures. They seem to be signs of Deities, and images of va-
rious objets. According to this Calendar in the Escurial, the Mex-
ican year contained 286 days, divided into -2 months of 13 days.
Each day is represented by a different sign, taken firom rome natural
objec, a serpent, a dog, a lizard, a reed, a house, &c. The signs
of days in the Calendar of the Efeurial are precisely the fame with
those mentioned by Boturini, Idea, &c. p. 45. But, if we may give
credit to that Author, the Mexican year contained 360 days, divided
into 18 months of 20 days. The order of clays in every month was
computed, according to him, firlfl by what he calls a iridecennary
proagreffion of days from one to thirteen, in the fame manner as in

the

477

# NOTE LV. p. 291.

-the Calendar of the Escurial, and then by afeplenary progression of
days fi-om one to seven, making in all twenty. In this Calendar, not
only the signs which diftinguifll each day, but the qualities supposed
to be peculiar to each month, are marked. There are certain weak-
neffes which seem to accompany the human mind through every stage
of its progress in observation and science. Slender as was the know-
ledge of the Mexicans in Astronomy, it appears to be already con-
nected with Judicial Astrology. The fortune and character of per-
,sons born in each month are supposed to be decided by some superior
influence predominant at the time of nativity. Hence it is foretold
in the Calendar, that all who are born in one month will be rich, in
another warlike, in a third luxurious, &c. The pasteboard, or what-
ever substance it may be, on which the Calendar in the Escurial is
painted, seems, by Mr. Waddilove's description of it, to resemble nearly
that in the Imperial library at Vienna. In several particulars, the
.figires bear some likeness to those in the plate which I have published.
The figures marked D. which induced me to conjecture, that this
painting might be a tribute-roll similar to these published by Purchas
and the Archbishop of Toledo, Mr. Waddilove supposes to be signs
of days; and I have such confidence in the accuracy of his obferva-
tions, as to conclude his opinion to be well founded. It appears from
the characters in which the explanations of the figures are written,
that this curious monument of Mexican art has been obtained, soon
after the conquest of the Empire. It is singular that it flhould never
have been mentioned by any Spanish Author.

through all the countries adjacent to them, viz. New Galicia, New

Teneriffe, or 460 leagues N.N.W. from Mexico. He describes
this minutely, and it appears to have been a paltry building of turf

formed that gentleman, that he had discovered the ruins of another set-
tlement similar to the former, about a hundred leagues towards N. W.
on the banks of the river St. Pedro. MS. penes me.

THOSE testimonies derive great credit from one circumitance, that

they were not given in support of any particular system or theory,
but' as simple answers to queries which I had proposed. It is pro-
bable, however, that when these gentlemen assert, that no ruins or
monuments of any ancient work whatever are now to be discovered
in the Mexican Empire, they meant that there were no such ruins
or monuments as conveyed any idea of grandeur or magnificence,
in the works of its ancient inhabitants. For it appears from the tef-
timony of several Spanish authors, that in Otumba, Tlafcala, Cholula,
&c. some vefliges of ancient buildings are still visible. Villa Segnor
Thcatro Amer. p. 143. 308. 353. D. Fran. Ant. Lorenzana, formerly
archbishop of Mexico, and now of Toledo, in his introdu&Eion to
that edition of the Cartas de Relacion of Cortes, which he publishcd
at Mexico, mentions some ruins which are still visible in several of
the towns, through which Cortes passed in his way to the capital, p. 4.
&c. But neither of these authors give any defeription of them,
and they seem to be so very inconsiderable, as to flow only that tome
buildings had once been there. The large mount of earth at Cholula,
which the Spaniards dignified with the name of temple, still remains,
but without any steps by which to ascend, or any facing of itone. It
appears now like a natural mount, covered with grass and lhrubs,

THE exaggeration of the Spanifhl liltoriins, withl iefpec- to the

number of human victims sacrificed in Mexico, appears to be

very great. According to Gomara, there was no year in lwhich

had counted them, informed Gomara that their number was a huin-
dred and thirty-fix thousand. Ibid. c. 82. Herrera's account is still

thousand have been sacrificed in o , nay

I T is hardly necessary to observe, that the Peruvian Chronology is

not only obscure, but repugnant to conclusions deduced from the

moff'accurate and extensive observations, concerning the time that
elapses during each reign, in any given fuccefflon of princes. The
medium has been found not to exceed twenty years. According to
Acofta and Garcilaffo de la Vega, Huana Capac, who died about the
year I527, was the twelfth Inca. The duration of the Peruvian mo-
narchy ought not to have been reckoned above two hundred and forty
years; but they affirm that it had subsisted four hundred years.
Acofta, lib. vi. c. 19. Vega, lib. i. c. 9g By this account each reign
is extended at a medium to thirty-threeyears, instead of twenty, tie
number alcer-tained by Sir Isaac Newton's observations; but so im-
perfet were the Peruvian traditions, that though the total is boldly
marked, the number of years in each reign is unknown.

authors. MS. penes me,. Articulo xx. Ulloa describes some of
the antient Peruvian fortifications, which were likewise works of
great extent and solidity. Tom. i. 39I. Three circumstances struck
all those observers: the vast size of the stones which the Peruvians
employed in some of their buildings. Acofta measured one, which
was thirty feet long, eighteen broad, and fix in thickness; and yet,
he adds, that in the fortress at Cuzco, there were stones considerably
larger. It is difficult to conceive how the Peruvians could move
these, and raise them to the height even of twelve feet. The second
circumstance is, the imperfection of the Peruvian art, when applied
to working in timber. By the patience and perseverance natural to
Americans, stones may be formed into any shape, merely by rubbing
one against another, or by the use of hatchets or other initruments
made of stone; but with such rude tools, little progress can be made
in cirpentry. The Peruvians could not mortize two beams together,
or give any degree of union, or flability to any work composed of
timber. As they could not form a centre, they were totally unac-
quainted with the use of arches in building, nor can the Spanifl au-
thors conceive how they were able to frame a roof for those ample
liructures which they raiscd.

THTE third circulmfancc is a striking proof, which all the monuments

of the Peruvians furnish, of their want of ingenuity and invention, ac-
companied with patience no lets altonifhing. None of the stones em-

them as they fell fiom the mountains, or were raised out of the quar-
ries. Some were square, rome triangular, fomeI convecx, some con-
cave. Their art and indutfty were employed in joining them to-
gether, by forming IUich hollows in the one, as perfectly correlfpndcd
to the iprojceions or risings in the other. This tedious operation
which might have been lo cafily abridged, by adapting the surface
of the floncs to each other, either by rubbing, or by their hatchets
of copper, would be deemed incredible, if it were not put beyond

very singular appearance to an European eye. There is no regular
layer or stratum of building, and no one stone resembles another in
dimensions or form. At the fame time, by the persevering, but ill-
dire&ed industry of the Indians, all are joined with that minute
nicety which I have mentioned. Ulloa made this observation con-

ITHE appearance of those bridges, which bend with their own

weight, wave with the wind, and are considerably agitated by the

But the Spaniards have found them to be the eafiefit mode of pafling the
torrents in Peru, over which it would be difficult to throw more solid
ftruclurcs either of stone or timber. They form those hanging bridges
so rfrong and broad that loaded mules pass alongft them. All the trade
of Cuzco is carried on by means of such a bridge over the river Apu-
rimac. Ullor, tom. i. 358. A more simple contrivance was em

P. Torribio de Benevente, or Motolinea, has enumerated ten causes

of the rapid depopulation of Mexico, to which he gives tle name

of the ten plagues. Many of these are not pcculia:- to tlat province.
i. The introdution of the finall-pox. This difiafe wab fiSrfi brought into
New Spain in the year i5-o, by anegro slave, who attended Narvaez.
Torribio affirms, that one half of the people, in the provinces visited
with this distemper, died. To this mortality occasioned by the finall-
pox, Torquernada adds the deftrut'ive effects of two contagious dif-
tempers which raged in the years 1545 and 15y6. In the former
8oo,ooo; in the latter, above two millions perifled, according to an
exact account taken by order of the viceroys. Mon. Ind. i. 642. The
small-pox were not introduced into Peru for several years after the in-
vafion of the Spaniards, but proved very fatal to the natives. Garcia
Origen, p. 88. 2. The numbers who were killed, or died of famine
in their war with the Spaniards, particularly during the fiegc of Mexi-
co. 3. The great famine that followed after the reducion of Mexico,
as all the people engaged, either on one fide or other, had neglected
the cultivation of their lands. Something fimilir to this happened in
all the other countries conquered by the Spaniards. 4. The grievous
tasks imposed by the Spaniards upon the people belonging to tlheir
Repartimientos. 5. The oppreflive burden of taxes which they were un-
able to pay, and from which they could hope for no exemption. 6. The
numbers employed in coilceting the gold, carried dowln 1 the torrents
from the mounrtains, who were forccd from their o\ nl habitations,
without any pirovifion nlade for their lilbfilnce, andl idtbjectd to all
the rigour of cold in tliofl clevatcd iregions. 7. Tli iinmenl i labour
or rebuilding Mexico, which Cortes urgetd on witlh iich prec:ipitate
ardour, as dcflroyed an incredible number of people. 8. '1 c nun-
ber of people condemned to fervitudc, under xvarilus lpretexts, and
employed in working the silver mines. These, nmiiked by cacli pro-1-
pri'tor with a hot iron, like his cattle, were driven in lhcrdt. to tihe

mountains. The nature of the labour to which they were fubjeated
thlere, the noxious vapours of the mines, the coldness of the climate,
and flcarcity of food, were so fatal, that Torribio affirms, the country
ol und several of those mines, particularly near Guaxago, was covered
with dead bodies, the air corrupted with their stench, and so many
vultures, and other voracious birds, hovered about for their prey, that
the fun was darlkened with their flight. Io. The Spaniards, in the dif-
ferent expeditions which they undertook, and by the civil wars which
they carried on, destroyed many of the natives, whom they compelled
to serve them as 'Tame7es, or carriers of burdens. This last mode ofop-
prefion was particularly ruinous to the Peruvians. From the number
of Indians who periihed in Gonzalo Pizarro's expedition into the coun-
tries to the eafl of the Andes, one may form some idea of what they
iliffertd, and how fast they wafted. Torribio, MS. Corita in his
Breve y Summaria Relacion, illustrates and confirms several of Torri-
bio's observations, to which he refers. MS. penes me.

N the seventh Title of the firfP book of the Recapilacioai, which con-
tains the laws concerning the powers and funcions of archbishops

and biihops, almost a third part of them relates to what is incumbent
upon them, as guardians of the Indians, and points out the various me-
thods in which it is their duty to interpose, in order to defend them
from oppreiflon, either with refpe& to their persons or property. Not
only do the laws commit to them this honourable and humane office,
but they actually exercise it.

INNUMERABLE proofs of this might be produced from Spanifli

authors. But I rather refer to Gage, as he was not disposed to
ascribe any merit to the popish clergy, to which they were not fully
entitled. Survey, p. 142. 192, &c. Henry Hawks, an English

I T is very difficult to obtain an accurate account of the 1tate of po-

pulation in those kingdoms of Europe where the police is mofi per-

sec, and where science has made the greatest progress. In Spanifli
America, where knowledge is still in its infancy,- and few men have
leisure to engage in researches merely speculative, little attention has
been paid to this curious inquiry. But in the year 174I, Philip V.
enjoined the viceroys and governors of the several provinces in Ame-
rica, to make an aAual survey of the people under theirjurifdiction,
and to tranfimit a report concerning their number and occupations.
In consequence of this order, the Conde de Fuen-Clara, viceroy of
New Spain, appointed D. Jos. Antonio de Villa-Segnor y Sanchez,- to
execute that commiflon in New Spain. From the reports of the ma-
giftrates in the several diftrits, as well as from his own observations,
and long acquaintance with most of the provinces, Villa Segnor pub-
lifhed the result of his inquiries in his Teatro Americano. Hiis report,
however, is imperfet. Of the nine dioceses, into which the Mexican
empire has been divided, he has publified an account only of five,
viz. the archbishopric of Mexico, the bishoprics of Los Angeles,
Mechoacan, Oaxaca, and Nova Galicia. The bifloprics-of Yucu-
tan, Verapaz, Chiapa, and Guatimala, are entirely omitted, though
the two latter comprehend countries, in which the Indian race is more
numerous than in any part of New Spain. In his survey of the extcn-
five diocese of Nova Galicia, the situation of the ldiftlrent Indian vil-
lages is describcd, but he specifies the number of people only in a
small part of it. The Indians of that vast province, in which the
Spanifl dominion is imperfectly cftablifled, are not registered with
the fame accuracy as in other parts of New Spain. According to
Villa Segnor, the actual slate of population in the five dioceses above
mentioned is of Spaniards, negroes, mulattocs, and mcflizos, in

AT the rate of five to a family, the total number is 1,471,955. We

may rely with greater certainty on this computation of the number of
Indians, as it is taken from the Matricula, or register, according to
which the tribute paid by them is colle&ed. As four dioceses of nine
are totally omitted, and in that of Nova Galicia, the numbers are
imperfetly recorded, we may conclude, that the number of Indians
in the Mexican empire exceeds two millions.

THE account of the number of Spaniards, &c. seems not to be

equally complete. Of many places, Villa Segnor observes in general
terms, that fcveral Spaniards, negroes, and peolple of a mixed race,
reside there, without specifying their number. If, therefore, we
make allowance for thcfc, and for all who reside in the four dioclees
omitted, the number of Spaniards, and of thole of a mixed race, may
probably anoullt to a million and a half: In lomle places, Villa
Segnor cdifinguifiles between Spaniard;s ad tin e thle c inferior races of

'1 R 2 i(cgi-oes,

negroes, Mulattos, and Mestizos, and marks their number separate-
ly. But he generally blends them together. But from the propor-
tion observable in those places, where the number of each is marked,
as well as from the account of the state of population in New Spain
by other authors, it is manifest that the number of negroes and per-
sons of a mixed race far exceeds that of Spaniards. Perhaps the
latter ought not to be reckoned above 500,000 to a million of the
former.

DEFECTIVE as this account may be, I have not been able to pro-

cure such intelligence concerning the number of people in Peru, as
might enable me to form any conjeture equally satisfying with refpet
to the degree of its population- I have been informed, that in the
year 1761, the protecor of the Indians in the vice-royalty of'Peru
computed that 61 2,780 paid tribute to the king. As all females, and
perfogs under age, are exempted from this tax in Peru, the total
number of Indians ought, by that account, to be 2,449,120. MS.
penes me.

I SHALL mention another mode, by which one may compute,..or at

least form a guess concerning the state of population in New Spain and
Peru. According to an account which I have reason to confider as.ac-
curate,. the number of copies,of the bull of Cruzada, exported to
Peru on each new publication, is 1,7 1,953; ,to New Spain 2,649,326.
I am informed, that but few. Indians purchase bulls, and.that they are
fold chiefly to the Spanish inhabitants, and those of mixed race, so
that the number of Spaniards, and people of. a mixed race, will
amount by this mode of computation to at least three millions.

THE number of inhabitants in many of the towns in Spanish Ame-

rica, may give us some idea of the extent of population, and correct
the inaccurate, but popular notion entertained in Great Britain, co- -
cerning the weak and desolate state of their colonies. The city of
Mexico contains at least 50,000 people. Los Angeles contains above

X 6,0o00

60,ooo Spaniards, and people of a mixed race. Villa Segnor, p. 247.
Guadalaxara contains above 30,000, exclusive of Indians. Id. ii. 206.
Lima contains 54,000. D. Cosine Bueno Defer. de Peru, 1764. Car-.
thagena contains 25,000. Potofi contains 25,000. Bueno, 1767.
Popayan contains above 20,000. Ulloa, i. 287. Towns of a second
class are still more numerous. The cities in the most thriving Settlements
of other European nations. in America cannot be compared with.
these..

THESE are such detached accounts of the number of people in fe-

veral towns, as I found scattered in authors whom I thought worthy
of credit. But I have obtained an enumeration of the inhabitants of.
the_ towns in the province of Quito, on the accuracy of which I can re-
ly; and 1-comlnunicated it to thePublic, both to gratify curiosity, and
to rectify the mistaken notion which I have mentioned. St. Francisco
de Quito contains between 50 and 60,000 people of. all the different
races. Besides the city, there are in the Corregimiento 29 curacies efta-
bliihed in the principal villages, each of which has smaller hamlets.
depending upon it. The inhabitants of there are mostly Indians and
Mestizos. St. Juan de Pasto has between 6 and 8000 inhabitants,
befdes 27 dependent villages. St. Miguel de Ibarra 7000 citizens,
and ten villages. The difirict of Havala between 18 and 20,000
people. The diftrid of Tacunna between. Io and 2,000. The
diftri&t of Ambato between 8 and io,ooo, betides 16 depending
villages. The city of Riobamba between i6 and 2o,ooo inhabitants,
and. 9 depending villages. The diftrif of Chimbo between 6 and
8000ooo. The city of Guyaquil from 16 to 20,000 inhabitants, and 14
depending villages. The diftric of Atuafi between 5 and 6000, and
4 depending villages. The city of Cuenza between 25 and 30,000
inhabitants, and 9 populous dependingvillages. The town of Laxa
from 8 to io,ooo inhabitants, and 14 depending villages. This de-
gree of population, though slender, if we confider the vast extent of
the country, is far beyond what is commonly supposed. I-have
omitted to mention, in its proper place, that Quito is the only pro

vince in Spanish America that can be denominated a manufaauring
country; hats, cotton stuffs, and coarse woollen cloths, are made
there in such quantities, as to be sufficient not only for the confump-
tion of the province, but to furnish a considerable article for exporta-
tion into other parts of Spaniih America. I know not whether the
uncommon industry of this province should be confidered as the cause
or the effect of its populousness. But among the ostentatious inhabit-
ants of the New World, the pafi'on for every thing that comes from
Europe is so violent, that I am informed the manufa&tures of Quito
are so much undervalued, as to be on the decline.

barren, and so distant fiom the ordinary habitations, of the Indians,
that the necessity of procuring labourers to work there, has obliged

remote provinces to resort to those mines. Efcalona Gazophyl.

IN the year I644, the city of Mexico presented a petition to the

king, praying that no new monaflery might be founded, and that the
revenues of those already eitablifled might be circumscribed, other-
wife the religious houses would soon acquire the property of the
whole country. They request likewise, that the bifhlops might be laid
under reftriEtions in conferring holy orders, as there were at that

mentions the profligacy of ecclesiastics in America at a very early pe-
riod after their settlement there. Hist. lib. ii. c. 19, 20. M. Frezier,

regular clergy, particularly in Peru, are still extremely indecent.
Acofta himself acknowledges that great corruption of manners
had been the consequence of permitting monks to forsake the retire-
ment and discipline of the cloister, and to mingle again with the
world, by undertaking the charge of the Indian parishes. De pro-
cur. Ind. Salute, lib. iv. c. 13, &c. He mentions particularly those
vices, of which I have taken notice, and confiders the temptations to
them as lb formidable, that he leans to the opinion of those who
hold that the regular clergy should not be employed as parish priess.
Lib. v. c. 20. Even the advocates for the regulars admit, that
many and great enormities abounded among the monks of different
orders, when set free from the restraint of monastic discipline; and
from the tone of their defence, one may conclude that the charge
brought against them was not destitute of truth. In the French co-
lonies, the state of the regular clergy is nearly the fame as in the Spa-
nifh tettlements, and the fame consequences have followed. M. Bier,
superior of the secular priells in Cayenne, inquires with no less ap-
pearance of piety than of candour, into the causes of this corruption,
and imputes it chiefly to the exemption of regulars fronllthe ju-ifdic-
tion and censures of their diocclans i to the temptations to which they
are exposed; and to their engaging in commerce. Voy. p. 32o. It

1730, having been communicated to me, I find there a striking con-
firmation of what I have advanced concerning the spirit of low illi-
beral superstition prevalent in Spanish America. From the news-
papers of any nation, one may learn what are the objects which
chiefly engross its attention, and appear to it most interetfing. The
Gazette of Mexico is filled almost entirely with accounts of religious
functions, with descriptions of processions, consecrations of churches,
beatifications of faints, festivals, autos de fe', &c. Civil or com-
mercial affairs, and even the tranfations of Europe,. occupy but a
finall corner in this magazine of monthly intelligence. From the
titles of new books, which are regularly inferred, it appears that two-
thirds of them are treatises of scholastic theology, or of Monkilh
devotion.

N OT only the native Indians, but the Mestizos, or children of

a Spaniard and Indian, were originally excluded from the priest-

hood, and refused admission into any religious order. But by a law
issued Sept. 28th, 1588, Philip II. required the prelates of America
to ordain itch mestizos born in lawful wedlock, as they lhould find
to be properly qualified, and to permit them to take the vows in any
monastery where they had gone through a regular noviciate. Recopil.
lib. i. tit. vii. 1. 7. Some regard seems to have been paid to this
law in New Spain; but none in Peru. Upon a representation of this
to Charles II. in the year I697, he issued a new edi& enforcing the
observation of it, and professing his desire to have all his iibjects
Indians, and mestizos as well as Spaniards admitted to the enjoyment
of the fame privileges. Such, however, was the aversion of the Spa-
niards in America to the Indians, and their race, that this seems to
have produced little effeEt; for, in the year 1725, Philip V. was
obliged to renew the injuntion in a more peremptory tone. But lb
unsurmountable are the hatred and contempt of the Indians among
the Peruvian Spaniards, that the pretent king has been constrained to
enforce the former edicts anew by a law, published September 1,

W' HEN the mines of Potofi were dilcovered in the year 1545, tile

veins -, ere so near the surface, that the ore was easily extracted,

and so rich, that it was refined with little trouble, and at finall ex-
pence, merely by the aetion of fire. This simple mode of refining
by fusion alone continued until the year 1574, when the use of mer-
cury in refining silver, as well as gold, was discovered. Thole minies
having been wrought without interruption for two centuries, the veins
are now funk so deep, that the expence of extracting the ore is greatly
increased. Besides this, the richness of the ore, contrary to what
happens in most other mines, has become less, as the vein continued
to dip, and has diminifled to fiuch a degree, that one is amazed that the
Spaniards ihould persist in working it. Other rich mines have been fuc-
ceflively discovered, but in general the value of the ores has decreated
so much, while the expence of extracting them has augmented, that
the court of Spain, in the year 1736, reduced the duty payable to the
king fiom a fish to a tenth. All the quicksilver tfi(d in Peru, is cx-
trafted from the famous mine of Guancabelica, dicoverced in the year
i563. The crown has reserved the property of this mine to irlelf;
and the per)lbns who purchased the quicksilver, paid not only tle
price of it, but likewiltf affth, as a duty to the king. But, in the
year 176i, this duty on quicksilver was abolilhed, on account of the
increale of expence in working mines. Ullo:, lntre tetinii netos,

M ANY remarkable proofs occur of the advanced state of industry

in Spain, at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The number

of cities in Spain was considerable, and they were peopled far beyond
the proportion that was common in other parts of Europe. The causes
of this I have explained, Hist. ofCha. V. i. 58. Wherever cities are
populous, that species of industry which is peculiar to them increases,
artificers and manufa&turers abound. The effe& of the American
trade in giving activity to these is manifest, from a singular fa&. In
the 1545, while Spain continued to depend on its own induflry, for the
supply of its colonies, so much work was bespoke from the manufac-
turers, that it was supposed they could hardly finish it in less than fix
years. Campom. i. 406. Such a demand must have put much in-
dufiry in motion, and have excited extraordinary efforts. Accord-
ingly, we are informed, that in the beginning of Philip II.'s reign,
the city of Seville alone, where the trade with America centered, gave
employment to no fewer than 16,ooo looms in silk or woollen work,
and that above 130,000 persons had occupation in carrying on these
Inanufactures. Camporn. ii. 472. But to rapid and pernicious was
the operation of the causes which I lhall enumerate, that before
Philip III. ended his reign, the looms in Seville were reduced to 400.

SINCE the publication of the firit edition, I have the fatisfacRion to

find my ideas concerning the early commercial intercourse between
Spain and her colonies confirmed and illustrated by D. Bernardo
Ward, of the Junta de Comercio at Madrid, in his ProyetSo Econo-
mico, Part ii. c. i. " Under the reigns of Charles V. and Philip II.
fays he, the manufaEtures of Spain and of the Low Countries fubje&
to her dominion were in a most flourilhing slate. Those of France
and England were in their infancy. The republic of the United Pro-
vinces did not then exist. No European power but Spain had co-
lonies of any value in the New World. Spain could supply her
settlements there with the productions of her own foil, the fabrics
wrought by the hands of her own artisans, and all fie received in re-
turn for these belonged to herself alone. Then the exclusion of
foreign manufatures was proper, because it might be rendered
effectual. Then Spain might lay heavy duties upon goods exported
to America, or imported from it, and might impose what reilraints
she deemed proper upon a commerce entirely in her own hands.
But when time and fucceflive revolutions had occasioned an alteration
in all those circumst-ances, when the manufactures of Spain began to
decline, and the demands of America were supplied by foreign fa-
brics, the original maxims and regulations of Spain should have
been accommodated to the change in her situation. The policy that
was wife at one period, became absurd in the other."

T HE account of the mode in which the factors of the South Sea

Company conducted the trade in the fair of Porto-bello, which

was opened to them by the Affiento, I have taken from Don Dion.
Alcedo y Herrera, president of the court of Audience in Quito, and
governor of that province. Don Dionyflo was a person of such a
refpeE-able character for probity and difcernmcnt, that his teflimony,
in any point, would be of much weight, but greater c&edit is due to
it in this cafe, as he was an eye-witness of the transactions which he
relates, and was often employed in detecting and authenticating the
frauds which he dcfcribes. It is probable, however, that his repre-
fentation being comnpoed at the commencement of the war which
broke out between Great Britain and Spain, in the year 1739, may,

in some instances, discover a portion of the acrimonious spirit, natural
at that juncture. His detail of facts is curious; and even English
authors confirm it in some degree, by admitting both that various frauds
were pradcifed in the tranfa&ions of the annual ship, and that the
contraband trade from Jamaica, and other British colonies, was be-
come enormously great. But for the credit of the Engliih nation it
may be observed, that those fraudulent operations are not to be con-
fidered as deeds of the company, but as the dishonourable arts of
their factors and agents. The company itfelffuftained a considerable
loss by the Afliento trade. Many of its servants acquired immense
fortunes. Anderson. Chronol. deduct. ii. 388.

SEVERALfaEts with refpeca to the institution, tile progress, and the

effects, of this company, are curious, and but little known to Eng-

lifh readers. Though the province of Venezuela, or Caraccas, ex-
tends four hundred miles along the coast, and is one of the most
fertile in America; it was so much neglected by the Spaniards, that
during the twenty years prior to the eftabliflhment of the company, only
five flips failed from Spain to that province; and during sixteen years,
from 1706 to 1722, not a tingle ship arrived from the Caraccas in
Spain. Noticias de Real Companiia de Caraccas, p. 28. During
this period Spain muif have been supplied almost entirely with the
large quantity of cacao, which it consumes, by foreigners. Before
the ereRion of the company, neither tobacco nor hides were imlport-
ed from Caraccas into Spain. Id. p. 117. But since the commer-
cial operations of the company began in the year 1731, the impor-
tation of cacao into Spain, has increaled amazingly. During thirty
years subsequent to 1701, the number of Fanegas of cacao (each a
hundred and ten pounds) imported fi-om Caraccas, was 643,215.
During eighteen years subsequent to 1731, the number of Fancgas
imported was 869,247 ; and if we fuppofl the importation to be conti-

nued in the fame proportion during the remainder of thirty years, it
will amount to 1,448,746 Fanegas, which is an increase of 805,531
Fanegas. Id. p. 148. During eight years subsequent to 1756, there
has been imported into Spain by the Company, 88,482 arrobas
(each twenty-five pound) of tobacco; and hides to the number of
177,354. Id. 161. Since the publication of the Noticias de Compa-
nia, in 1765, its trade seems to be on the increase. During five
years subsequent to 1769, it has imported 179,I56 Fanegas of cacao
into Spain, 36,208 arrobas of tobacco, 75,496 hides, and 221,432
pesos in specie. Campomanes, ii. 162. The lass article is a proof of
the growing wealth of the colony.. It. receives cafl from Mexico in
return for the cacao, with which it supplies that province, and this it
remits to Spain, or lays out in purchasing European goods. But, be-
fides this, the most explicit evidence is produced, that the quantity of
cacao raised in the province is double to what it yielded in 1731; the
number of its live-stock is more than treble, and its inhabitants much
augmented. The revenue of the bifliop,. which arises wholly from
tythes, has increased from eight to twenty thousand pesos. Notic,
p. 69. In consequence of the augmentation of the quantity of cacao
imported into Spain, its price has decreased from eighty pesos for
the fanega to forty. Id. 61. Since the publication of the firlt edi-
tion, I have learned that Guyana,. including all the extensive pro-
vinces situated on the banks of the Orinoco, the islands of Trinidad
and Margarity are added to the countries with which the company
of Caraccas had liberty of trade by their former charters. Real Ce-
dula, Nov. 19, 1776. But I have likewise been informed that the
inifitution of this company has not been attended with all the bene-
ficial effed's which I have ascribed to it. In many of its operations
the illiberal and oppressive spirit of monopoly is conspicuous. But in
order to explain this, it would be neceflary to enter into minute de-
tails, which are not suited to the nature of this work.

IT l HIS firfl experiment made by Spain of opening a free trade with
any of her colonies, has produced efiects so remarkable, as to

merit some farther illultration. The towns to which this liberty has
been granted, are Cadiz and Seville, for the province of Andalulia; Ali-
cant and Carthagena, for Valencia and Murcia; Barcelona, for Cata-
lonia and Arragon; Santander, for Castile; Corugna, for Galicia; and
Gijon, for Aflurias. Append. ii. a la educ. popul. p. 4I. These are
either the ports of chief trade in their respective diftrias, or those most
conveniently situated for the exportation of their refpedive produc-
tions. The following facts give a view of the increase of trade in the
settlements, to which the new regulations extend. Prior to the allow-
ance of free trade, the duties collected in the custom-house at the Ha-
vanna, were computed to be 104,208 pesos annually. During the five
years preceding 1774, they role at a medium to 308,000 pesos a year.
In Yucatan, the duties have risen from 8,ooo to I5,000. In Hifpa-
niola firom 2,500 to 5,600. In Porto Rico from 1,200 to 7,000. The

many authors, even in the nations most eminent for commercial know-

ledge of those various subjects, and a more perfect freedom from vul-
gar and national prejudices, or who have united more happily the
calm researches of philosophy, with the ardent zeal of a public spirited

particular illustration. The right to the tyt;es in the New World, is
vested in the crown of Spain, by a bull of Alexander VI. Charles V.
appointed them to be applied' in the following manner. One fourth
is allotted to the bishop of the diocese, another fourth to the dean and
chapter, and other officers of the cathedral. The remaining half' i
divided into nine eqtiX parts. Two of these, under the denoinia-
tion of los dos Noveobs reales, aie paid to the crown, and conftitutce a
branch of the royal revenue. The other seven parts arc applied to
the maintenance of the parochial clergy, the building and support of
churches, and other pious uies. Recopil. lib. i. tit. xvi. Ley. 2,

I IAVE not been able to procure any accurate detail of the several

branches of revenue in Peru, later than the year 1614. From a curi-
ous manuscript, containing a state of that vice-royalty in all its depart-
Inents, presentcd to the Marquis of Montes-Cla-os, by Fran. I.opez
Caravantes, accomptant-gcnerall in the tribunal of Lima, it appears,
that the public revenue, as nearly as 1 can copllute thle value of the

VOL. II. 3 U mony(

money in which Caravantes tfates his accounts, that the revenue col-
le&ed, amounted in ducats, at 4s. iid., to - 2,372,768

Expences of government - - 1,242,992

Net free revenue 1,129,776

The total in sterling money .

£- 583,303
Expences of government -305,568

Net free revenue 277,735

BUT several articles appear to be omitted in this computation, such

as the duty on stamped paper, leather, ecclesiastical annats, &c. so
that the revenue of Peru may be well supposed equal to that of
Mexico.

IN computing the expence of government in New Spain, I may

take that of Peru as a standard. There the annual establishment for
defraying the charge of adminiifration, exceeds one half of the re-
venue collected, and there is no reason for supposing it to be less in
New Spain.

I HAVE obtained a calculation of the total amount of the public

revenue of Spain from America and the Philippines, which, as the
reader will perceive from the two last articles, is more recent than
any of the former.

produce of the mines mull be ten millions flerling; a itnm so exor-
bitant, and so little corresponding with all accounts of the annual im-
portation from America, that the information on which it is founded
murf evidently be erroneous. According to Campomanes, the total

HE Marquis de Serralvo, according to Gage, by a monopoly of
salt, and by embarking deeply in the Manila trade as well as in

that to Spain, gained annually a million of ducats. In one year he
remitted a million of ducats to Spain, in order to purchase from the
Conda Olivares, and his creatures, a prolongation of his government,
p. 61. He was fiuccefsful in his suit, and continued in office from,
1624 to 1635, double the usual time.

# SHORT ACCOUNT OF What is contained in the LETTER sent to the EMPEROR, mentioned Preface, p. xi.

SHORT ACCOUNT

O F
What is contained in the LETTER sent to the

EMPEROR, mentioned Preface, p. xi
r H I S letter is dated July 6th, ISI9. Cortes in his

second dispatch takes notice that it was sent off on the
i6th of July.

THE great object of the persons who wrote this letter, is to

j.ustify their own conduct in establishing a colony independent
on the jurifdidion of Velasquez. With this view they en-
deavour to detract from his merit, in fitting out the two
former armaments under Cordova and Grijalva, representing
there as equipped by the adventurers who engaged in the ex-
pedition, not by the governor. They labour likewise to depre-
ciate the services of Cordova and Grijalva, in order to exalt the
merit of their own exploits.

TiHEY contend, that the sole objeCt of Velasquez was to

trade or barter with the natives, not to attempt the conquest
of New Spain, or the eftabflhlmcnt of a colony there. This is
frequently mentioned by B. Diaz del Castillo, c. 19. 41, 4R,
&c. But if Vclafquez had not conquest and settlement in
view, there seems to have been no rcafon for equipping ficli a
considerable armament.

TIIK1. E
3

Ti'i. v aiTert, that Cortes defrayed the greatest part of tile cx-

pcnce of fitting out the armament. But this does not agree
with the account of his slender fortune given by Gomara,
Cron. c. 7. and B. Diaz, c. 20, or what I have mentioned
Note iii. vol. ii.

THEY take notice, that though considerable numbers were

wounded in their different encounters with the people of Ta-
bafco, not one of them died, and all recovered in a short time.
This seems to confirm what I have observed vol. ii. p. 39, con-
cerning the imperfel2ion of the offensive weapons of the
Americans.

THEY give some account of the manners and institutions of

the Mexicans. It is very ihort, and as they had resided but a
ihort time in the country, and had but little intercourse with
the natives, it is both defecive and inaccurate. They describe
minutely, and with great horror, the human sacrifices offered
by the Mexicans to their deities, and affirm that some of their
number were eye-witnesses of those barbarous rites.

THEY subjoin to their letter a catalogue and description of

the presents sent to the emperor. That published by Gomara,
Cron. c. 29. seems to have been copied from it, and Pet.
Martyr describes many of the articles in his treatise De Infulis
nuper inventis, p. 354, &c.
