# PREFACE.

PRE F A C E.
rT HE perusal of Major Rennell's Memoir for

illustrating his Map of Indoftan, one of the

most valuable geographical treatises that has appeared
in any age or country, gave rife to the following
work. It suggested to me the idea of examining
more fully than I had done in the Introdutory
Book to my History of America, into the know-
ledge which the Ancients had of India, and of
confidering what is certain, what is obscure, and
what is fabulous, in the accounts of that country
which they have handed down to us. In un-
dertaking this inquiry, I had originally no other
object than my own amusement and inftru&ion:

a But

But in carrying it on, and consulting with care the
authors of antiquity, some fa&s, hitherto unob-
served, and many which had not been examined
with proper attention, occurred; new views
opened; my ideas gradually extended and became
more interesting; until, at length, I imagined that
the result of my researches iight prove amusing
and inftrutive to others, by exhibiting such a view
of the various modes in which intercourse with
India had been carried on from the earliest times,
as might ihew how much that great branch of
commerce has contributed, in every age, to in-
crease the wealth and power of the nations which
possessed it.

THUS the Historical Disquisition which I now

lay before the Reader was begun and completed.
What degree of merit it pofleffes, the Public muff
determine. My grateful recollecion of the fa-
vourable manner in which my other works have
been received, naturally increases the solicitude with
which I wait for its decision concerning this which
I now publih.

WHEN
vi

WHEN I sirs turned my thoughts to this sub-

je&, I was so fully aware of the disadvantage under
which I laboured in undertaking to describe coun-
tries of which I had not any local knowledge, that
I have been at the utmost pains to guard againfi
any errors which this might occasion. I have con-
fulted, with persevering industry, the works of
all the authors I could procure, who have given
any account of India; I have never formed any
decided opinion, which was not supported by re-
fpe&able authority; and as I have the good for-
tune to reckon among the number of my friends
some Gentlemen who have filled important fia-
tions, civil and military, in India, and who have
visited many different parts of it, I had recourse
frequently to them, and from their conversation
learned things which I could not have found in
books. Were it proper to mention their names,
the Public would allow that by their discern-
ment and abilities they are fully entitled to the
confidence which I have placed in them.

a 2

vil
IN

IN the progress of the work, I became sensible

of my own deficiency with refpet to another
point. In order to give an accurate idea of the
imperfection both of the theory and pratice of
navigation among the Ancients, and to explain with
scientific precision, the manner in which they afcer-
tained the position of places, and calculated their
longitude and latitude, a greater portion of mathe-
matical knowledge was requisite, than my attention
to other studies had permitted me to acquire. What
I wanted, the friendihip of my ingenious and re-
fpeaable Colleague, Mr. Playfair, Professor of Ma-
thematics, has supplied, and I have been enabled by
him to elucidate all the points I have mentioned, in
a manner which, I am confident, will afford my
Readers complete fatisfation. To him, likewise,
I am indebted for the conftruaion of two maps
neceifary for illustrating this Disquisition, which
without his assistance I could not have under-
taken.

I HAVE adhered, in this work, to an arrangement
I followed in my former compositions, and to

12 which

which the Public has been long accustomed. I
have kept historical narrative as much separate as
possible from scientific and critical discussions, by
reserving the latter for Notes and Illustrations. I
flatter myself that I may claim, without prefump-
tion, the merit of having examined with diligence
what I submit to public infpeaion, and of having
referred, with scrupulous accuracy, to the authors
from whom I have derived information.

AN
HISTORICAL DISQUISITION

CONCERNING
ANCIENT INDIA.

SECTION 1.
Iltercourfe with India, from the earllieI Times, until the Conquefi

of Egypt by the Romans.
W -IHOEVER attempts to trace the operations of men S E C T.

in remote times, and to mark the various steps of ,-.

their progress in any line of exertion, will soon have the mor-
tification to find, that the period of authentic history is ex-
tremely limited. It is little more than three thousand years
since the Books of Moses, the most ancient and only genuine
record of what passed in the early ages of the world, were

B composed.

S E C T. composed. Herodotus, the moll ancient Heathen historian

; ' . whose works have reached us, flourifled a thousand years

later. If we pulh our inquiries concerning any point beyond
the xra where written history commences, we enter upon the
region of conjecure, of fable, and of uncertainty. Upon that
ground I will neither venture myself, nor endeavour to condut
my readers. In my researches concerning the intercourse be-
tween the Eatern and Western regions of the earth, and con-
cerning the progress of that great branch of trade, which, in
every age, has contributed so conspicuously towards rrifing the
people who carried it on, to wealth and power, I ihall con-
fine myself within the precincs I have marked out. Where-
ever the inspired writers, intent upon higher objets, mention
occasionally any circumstance that tends to illuitrate the subjea
cf my inquiries, I ihall attend to it with reverence. What-
ever other writers relate, I shall examine with freedom, and
endeavour to ascertain the degree of credit to which they are
entitled.

THE original station allotted to man by his Creator, was in

the mild and fertile regions of the Ealf. There the human
race began its career of improvement; and from the remains
of sciences which were anciently cultivated, as well as of arts
which were anciently exercised in India, we may conclude
it to be one of the first countries in v;hich men made any
conlider.ble progrefi in that career. The wiidom of the East
was carly celebrated ', and its producions were early in re-

i Kings, iv. 30.

quest among distant nations ". The intcrcourfe, however, be- S E C T.
tween different countries was carried on at firfl entirely by _
land. As the people of the Eafl appear soon to have acquired
complete dominion over the ufcful animals ', they could
early undertake the long and toilsome journies which it was
necessary to make, in order to maintain this intercourse; and
by the provident bounty of Heaven, they were furnilhed with
a beast of burden, without whose aid it would have been im-
poffiblc to accomplish them. The Camel, by its persevering
strength, by its moderation in the use of food, and the
singularity of its internal ftrudure, which enables it to lay in a
flock of water sufficient for several days, put it in their power
to convey bulky commodities through those deserts, which
must be traversed by all who travel from any of the countries
weft of the Euphrates towards India. Trade was carried on
in this manner, particularly by the nations near to the Arabian
Gulf, from the earliest period to which historical information
reaches. Distant journies, however, would be undertaken at
firlt only occasionally, and by a few adventurers. But by
degrees, from attention to their mutual safety and comfort,
numerous bodies of merchants assembled at stated times, and
forming a temporary aflociation (known afterwards by the
name of a Caravan), governed by officers of their own choice,
and filhjct to regulations of which experience had taught
them the utility, they performed journies of such extent and
duration, as appear aftonifling to nations not accuflomcd to
this mode of carrying on commerce.

BUT

S E C T. BUT notwithltanding every improvement that could be made

in the manner of conveying the productions of one country
to another by land, the inconveniences which attended it were
obvious and unavoidable. It was often dangerous; always
expensive, and tedious, and fatiguing. A method of commu-
nication more easy and expeditious was fought, and the inge-
nuity of man gradually discovered, that the rivers, the arms
of the sea, and even the ocean itself, were defined to open and
facilitate intercourse with the various regions of the earth,
between which they appear, at firfi view, to be placed as
insuperable barriers. Navigation, however, and ship-building,
(as I have observed in another work d) are arts so nice and
complicated, that they require the talents, as well as experience
of many successive ages, to bring them to any degree of per-
fetion. From the raft or canoe, which sirs served to carry a
iavage over the river that obftruded him in the chace, to the
confiruaion of a vessel capable of conveying a numerous
crew, or a considerable cargo of goods, to a distant coast, the
progress of improvement is immense. Many efforts would be
made, many experiments would be tried, and much labour as
well as ingenuity would be employed, before this arduous and
important undertaking could be accomplifled.

EVEN after some improvement was made in ship-building,

the intercourse of nations with each other by sea was far from
being extensive. From the accounts of the earliest historians,
we learn that navigation made its first efforts in the Mediter-

4 Hist. of America, vol. i, p. 2.

ranean and the Arabian Gulf, and in them the first afive S E C T.
operations of commerce were carried on. From an attentive
infpei.on of the position and form of these two great inland
seas, these accounts appear to be highly probable. These seas
lay open the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and
spreading to a great extent along the coasts of the most fertile
and most early civilized countries in each, seem to have been
dcftined by nature to facilitate their communication with one
another. We find, accordingly, that the first voyages of the
Egyptians and Phenicians, the most ancient navigators men-
tioned in history, were made in the Mediterranean. Their
trade, however, was not long confined to the countries bor-
dering upon it. By acquiring early possession of ports on the
Arabian Gulf, they extended the sphere of their commerce,
and are represented as the first people of the Weft who opened
a communication by sea with India.

IN that account of the progress of navigation and discovery

which I prefixed to the History of America, I confidered with
attention the maritime operations of the Egyptians and Phe-
nicians; a brief review of them here, as far as they relate to
their connction with India, is all that is requisite for illuftrat-
ing the fuljea of my present inquiries. With refped to the
former of thele people, the information which history affords is
lender, and of doubtful authority. The fertile foil and mild
climate of Egypt produced the necefaries and comforts of life
in flch profusion, as to render its inhabitants so independent of
othcr countries, that it became early an eftablifled maxim in
tlcir policy, to renounce all intcrcourfe with foreigners. In

consequence

5s

S E C T. consequence of this, they held all sea-faring persons in detefta-

tion, as impious and profane; and fortifying their harbours,
they denied strangers admiflion into them'.

TIE enterprising ambition of SefofRris, disdaining the re-

firaints imposed upon it by there contracted ideas of his filb-
jeas, prompted him to render the Egyptians a commercial
people; and in the course of his reign, he so completely ac-
complifhed this, that (if we may give credit to some Historians)
he was able to fit out a fleet of four hundred ships in the
Arabian Gulf, which conquered all the.countries stretching along
the Erythrean sea to India. At the fame time, his army,
led by himself, marched through Asia, and fubjeaed to his do.
minion every part of it as far as to the banks of the Ganges;
and, crossing that river, advanced to the Eastern Ocean'.
But these efforts produced no permanent effeCt, and appear
to have been so contrary to the genius and habits of the
Egyptians, that, on the death of Sefofiris, they resumed their
ancient maxims, and many ages elapsed before the commercial
conneaion of Egypt with India came to be of such importance
as to merit any notice in this Disquisition ;.

THE hiflory of the early maritime operations of Phenicia are

not involved in the fame obscurity with those of Egypt. Every
circumstance in the characer and situation of the Phenicians,

was favourable to the commercial spirit. The territory which S E C T.
they possessed, was neither large nor fertile. It was from _
commerce only, that they could derive either opulence or
power. Accordingly, the trade carried on by the Phenicians
of Sidon and Tyre, was extensive and adventurous; and, both
in their manners and policy, they resemble the great com-
mercial states of modern times, more than any people in the
ancient world. Among the various branches of their com-
merce, that with India may be regarded as one of the
molt considerable and most lucrative. As by their situation
on the Mediterranean, and the imperfect state of navigation,
they could not attempt to open a direc communication with
India by sea; the enterprizing spirit of commerce prompted
them to wrest from the Idumaans some commodious har-
bours towards the bottom of the Arabian Gulf. From these
they held a regular intercourse with India, on the one
hand, and with the Eastern and Southern coasts of Africa
on the other. The distance, however, from the Arabian Gulf
to Tyre was considerable, and rendered the conveyance
of goods to it by land carriage so tedious and expensive, that
it became necessary for them to take possession of Rhinocolura,
the nearell port in the Mediterranean to the Arabian Gulf.
Thither all the commodities brought from India, were con-
veyed over land by a route much florter, and more pracicable
than that by which the productions of the East were carried at a
fublcquent period from the opposite ihore of the Arabian
Gulf to the Nileh. At Rhinocolura, they were relhipped,
and transportcd by an cafy navigation to Tyre, and distributed

through

S E C T. through the world. This, as it is the earliest route of com-

1' . munication with India, of which we have any authentic

description, had so many advantages over any ever known before
the modern discovery of a new course of navigation to the
East, that the Phenicians could supply other nations with the
productions of India in greater abundance, and at a cheaper
rate, than any people of antiquity. To this circumstance,
which, for a considerable time, secured to them a monopoly of
that trade, was owing, not only the extraordinary wealth of
individuals, which rendered the " merchants of Tyre, Princes,
"and her traffickers the Honourable of the Earth ;" but the
extensive power of the state itself, which firfl taught mankind
to conceive what vast resources a commercial people poisess, and
what great exertions they are capable of making k.

THE Jews, by their vicinity to Tyre, had such an opportunity

of observing the wealth which flowed into that city from the
lucrative commerce carried on by the Phenicians from their
fcttlements on the Arabian Gulf, as incited them to aim at
obtaining some share of it. This they effeced under
the prosperous reigns of David and Solomon, partly by the
conquests which they made of a small diftrit in the land of
Edom, that gave them pofflelion of the harbours of Elath and
Eliongeber on the Red Sea, and partly by the friendship of
Hiram, king of Tyre; who enabled Solomon to fit out
fleets, which, under the direcion of Phenician pilots, failed
to Tarlhifh and Ophir'. In what region of the earth we ihould

search for these famous ports which furnished the navy of S E C T.
Solomon with the various commodities enumerated by the ,
sacred historians, is an inquiry that has long exercised the
industry of learned men. They were early supposed to be
situated in some part of India, and the Jews were held to be
one of the nations which traded with that country. But the
opinion more generally adopted is, that Solomon's fleets, after
pafiing the firaits of Babelmandeb, held their course along
the south-west coast of Africa, as far as the kingdom of Sofala;
a country celebrated for its rich mines of gold and silver,
(from which it has been denominated the Golden Sofala by
Oriental writers ",) and abounding in all the other articles which
composed the cargoes of the Jewish ships. This opinion,
avhich the accurate researches of M. D'Anville rendered highly
probable", seems now to be eftablithed with the utmost cer-
tainty by a late learned traveller; who, by his knowledge
of the monsoons in the Arabian Gulf, and his attention to
the ancient mode of navigation, both in that sea and along
the African coast, has not only accounted for the extraordinary
length of time which the fleets of Solomon took in going and
returning, but has Ihewn, from circumflances mentioned con-
cerning the voyage, that it was not made to any place in
India °. The Jews, then, we may conclude, have no title to be
reckoned among the nations which carried on intercourse with
India by fca; and if, from deference to the sentiments of
Sfome refpel)able authors, their claim were to be admitted,

S E C T. we know with certainty, that the commercial effort which they

made in the reign of Solomon was merely a transient one,
and that they quickly returned to their former state of unsocial
seclusion from the reft of mankind.

FROM collecting the scanty information which history affords,

concerning the most early attempts to open a commercial inter-
course with India, I now proceed, with more certainty and
greater confidence, to trace the progress of communication with
that country, under the guidance of authors who recorded
events nearer to their own times, and with respect to which,
they had received more full and accurate intelligence.

THE firt eftabliflment of any foreign power in India, which

can be ascertained by evidence, meriting any degree of credit,
is that of the Persians; and even of this we have only a very
general and doubtful account. Darius, the son of Hytafpes,
though raised to the throne of Persia by chance or by artifice,
porfeffed such acive and enterprizing talents, as rendered him
worthy of that high station. He examined the different
provinces of his kingdom more diligently than any of his
prcdeceffors, and explored regions of Asia formerly little
knownp. Having fubjctlcd to his dominion many of the
countries which stretch south-east from the Caspian sea
towards the river Oxus, his curiosity was excited to acquire
a more cxclufive and accurate knowledge of India, on which
they bordered. With this view he appointed Scylax of
'.r)a:d3ra to take the command of a squadron fitted out at

Cafpatyrus, in the country of Pa&ya, [the modern Pehkely,] S E C T.
towards the upper part of the navigable course of the river . _,
Indus, and to fall down its stream until he fiould reach the
ocean. This Scylax performed, though it flould seem with
much difficulty, and notwithstanding many obifacles; for he
spent no less than two years and fix months in conduting his
squadron from the place where he embarked, to the Arabian
Gulf'. The account which he gave of the populousness, ser-
tility, and high cultivation of that region of India through
which his course lay, rendered Darius impatient to become
master of a country so valuable. This he soon accomplified;
and though his conquests in India seem not to have extended
beyond the diltria watered by the Indus, we are led to form an
high idea of its opulence, as well as of the number of its inha-
bitants, in ancient times, when we learn, that the tribute which
lie levied from it, was near a third part of the whole revenue
of the Persian monarchy'. But neither this voyage of Scylax,
nor the conquests of Darius, to which it gave rife, diffused
any general knowledge of India. The Greeks, who were the
only enlightened people at that time in Europe, paid but little
attention to the tranfadions of the people whom they confidered
as Barbarians, especially in countries far remote from their
own; and Scylax had embellished the narrative of his voyage
with so many circumRances, manifestly fabulous', that he
seems to have met with the just punishment, to which persons
who have a notorious propenity to what is marvellous, are often

- relate what is exatly true.

ABOUT an hundred and sixty years after the reign of Darius

Hyltafpes, Alexander the Great undertook his expedition into
India. The wild sallies of pallion, the indecent excesses of
intemperance, and the ostentatious displays of vanity too
frequent in the conduct of this extraordinary man, have
so degraded his characer, that the pre-eminence of his
merit, either as a conqueror, a politician, or a legislator, has
seldom been julfly estimated. The fubje& of my present in-
quiry leads me to confider his operations only in one light, but
it will enable me to exhibit a striking view of the grandeur
and extent of his plans. He seems, soon after his first fuccefles
in Asia, to have formed the idea of establishing an universal
monarchy, and aspired to the dominion of the sea, as well as
of the land. From the wonderful efforts of the Tyrians in
their own defence, when left without any ally or proteetor,
he conceived an high opinion of the resources of maritime
power, and of the wealth to be derived from commerce, efpe-
cially that with India, which he found engrossed by the citi-
zens of Tyre. With a view to secure this commerce, and to
eftablilh a station for it, preferable in many refpeas to that of
Tyre, as soon as he completed the conquest of Egypt, he
founded a city near one of the mouths of the Nile, which he
honoured with his own name; and with such admirable dif-
cernment was the fitnation of it chosen, that Alexandria soon
became the greatest trading city in the ancient world; and, not-
withstanding many successive revolutions in empire, continued,

during
12

during eighteen centuries, to be the chief feat of commerce S E C T.
with India'. AmidRf the military operations to which Alex-
ander was soon obliged to turn his attention, the desire of
acquiring the lucrative commerce which the Tyrians had car-
ried on with India, was not relinquished. Events soon occur-
red, that not only confirmed and added strength to his desire,
but opened to him a profpe&t of obtaining the sovereignty of
those regions which supplied the reft of mankind with so many
precious commodities.

AFTER his final vitory over the Persians, he was led in

pursuit of the las Darius, and of Beflus, the murderer of that
unfortunate monarch, to traverse that part of Asia which
firetches from the Caspian sea beyond the river. Oxus. He
advanced towards the eaf as far as Maracanda", then a city of
some note, and destined, in a future period, under the modern
name of Samarcand, to be the capital of an empire not infe-
rior to his own in extent or power. In a progress of several
months, through provinces hitherto unknown to the Greeks,
in a line of march often approaching near to India, and
among people accuflomed to much intercourse with it, be
learned many things concerning the state of a country ' that
had been long the objec of his thoughts and wifless', which
increased his desire of invading it. Decisive and prompt in all
his resolutions, he set out from Baaria, and crossed that ridge
of mountains which, under various denominations, forms the

E C T. Stony Girdle (if I may use an expression of the Oriental

geographers) which encircles Asia, and confitutes the northern
barrier of India.

THE most pracicable avenue to every country, it is obvious,

must be formed by circumstances in its natural situation, such as
the defiles which lead through mountains, the course of rivers,
and the places where they-may be passed with the greatest
cafe and safety. In no place of the earth is this line of ap-
proach marked and defined more conspicuously, than on the
northern frontier of India; insomuch that the three great
invaders of this country, Alexander, Tamerlane, and Nadir
Shah, in three distant ages, and with views and talents ex-
tremely different, advanced by the fame route, with hardly any
deviation. Alexander had the merit of having first discovered
the way. After passing the mountains, he encamped at Alex-
andria Paropamifana, on the fame site with the modern city
Candahar; and having subdued or conciliated the nations feated
on the north-west bank of the Indus, he crofled the river at
Taxila, now Attock, the only place where its stream is so
tranquil that a bridge can be thrown over it'.

AFTER passing the Indus, Alexander marched forward in

the road which leads directly to the Ganges, and the opulent
provinces to the south-east, now comprehended under the ge-
neral name of Indoftan. But, on the banks of the Hydafpes,
known in modern times by the name of the Betah or Chelum,

at the head of a numerous army. The war with Porus, and _
the hostilities in which he was fuccefively engaged with other
Indian princes, led him to deviate from his original route, and
to turn more towards the south-west. In carrying on there
operations, Alexander marched through one of the richest and
best peopled countries of India, now called the Panjab, from
the five great rivers by which it is watered; and as we know
that this march was performed in the rainy season, when even
Indian armies cannot keep the field, it gives an high idea both
of Alexanders persevering spirit, and of the extraordinary
vigour and hardiness of constitution which soldiers, in ancient
times, derived from the united effeats of gymnastic exercise
and military discipline. In every ftep of his progress, objets
no less firiking than new presented themselves to Alexander.
The magnitude of the Indus, even after he had seen the Nile,
the Euphrates, and the Tigris, must have filled him with fur-
prise . No country he had hitherto visited was so populous
and well cultivated, or abounded in so many valuable produc-
tions of nature and of art, as that part of India through which
he had led his army. But when he was informed in every
place, and probably with exaggerated description, how much
the Indus was inferior to the Ganges, and how far all that he
had hitherto beheld was surpassed in the happy regions through
which that great river flows, it is not wonderful that his eager,
nces to view and to take pofTeflion of them should, have
prompted him to aftemble his soldiers, and to propofc that

they

s E C T. they hfould resume their march towards that quarter where

. _ wealth, dominion, and fame awaited them. But they had

already done so much, and had suffered so greatly, especially
from incessant rains ' and extensive inundations, that their
patience as well as flrength were exhausted , and with one
voice they refused to advance farther. In this resolution
they persisted with such fullen obstinacy, that Alexander,
though possessed in the highest degree of every quality that
gains an ascendant over the minds of military men, was obliged
to yield, and to issue orders for marching back to Persia'.

THE scene of this memorable-tranfa&ion was on the banks

of the Hyphafis, the modem Beyah, which was the utmost
limit of Alexander's progress in India. From this it is mani-
fell, that he did not traverse the whole extent of the Panjab.
Its fouth-weR boundary is formed by a river anciently known
by the name of Hyfudrus, and now by that of the Setlege, to
which Alexander never approached nearer than the southern
bank of the Hyphafis, where he ereaed twelve stupendous
altars, which he intended as a monument of his exploits, and
which (if we may believe the biographer of Apollonius Tya-
naus) were frill remaining, with legible inscriptions, when
that fantastic fophit visited India, three hundred and seventy-
three years after Alexander's expedition d. The breadth of the
Panjab, from Ludhana on the Setlege to Attock on the Indus,
is computed to be two hundred and fifty-nine geographical

miles,
i

mniles, in a straight line; and Alexander's march, computed in S E C T.
*the fame manner, did not extend above two hundred miles. _
But, both as he advanced and returned, his troops were so
spread over the country, and often aaed in so many separate
divisions, and all his movements were lb exaCtly measured and
delineated by men of science, whom he kept in pay for the
purpose, that he acquired a very extensive and accurate know-
ledge of that part of India'.

WHEN, upon his return, he reached the banks of the

Hydafpes, he found that the officers to whom he had given it
in charge to build and colle& as many veflels as possible, had
executed his orders with such acivity and success that they
had assembled a numerous fleet. As amidst the hurry of war,
and the rage of conquest, he never loft fight of his pacific
and commercial schemes, the destination of this fleet was to fail
down the Indus to the ocean, and from its mouth to proceed
to the Persian Gulf, that a communication by sea might be
opened with India and the centre of his dominions.

THE Conduc of this expedition was committed to Nearchus,

an officer equal to that important trust. But as Alexander was
ambitious to acquire fame of every kind, and fond of engage-
ing in new and splendid undertakings, he himself accompanied
Nearchus in his navigation down the river. 'he armament
was, indeed, so great and magnificent, as deserved to be cofn-
manded by the conqueror of Asia. It was composed of an

army

S E C T. army of a hundred and twenty thousand men, and two hun-

_--, dred elephants, and of a fleet of near two thousand vessels,

various in burden and form'; on board of which one-third
of the troops embarked, while the remainder marching in two
divisions, one on the right, and the other on the left, of the
river, accompanied them in their progress. As they advanced,
the nations on each fide were either compelled or persuaded
to submit. Retarded by the various operations in which this
engaged him, as well as by the flow navigation of such a fleet
as he conducted, Alexander was above nine months before he
reached the ocean '.

ALEXANDER'S progress in India, in this line of dire&ion,

was far more considerable than that which he made by the
route we formerly traced; and when we attend to the various
movements of his troops, the number of cities which they
took, and the different states which they subdued, he may
be said not only to have viewed, but to have explored, the
countries through which he passed. This part of India
has been so little frequented by Europeans in later times,
that neither the position of places, nor their distances,
can be ascertained with the fame accuracy as in the in-
terior provinces, or even in the Panjab. But from the
researches of Major Rennell, carried on with no less discern-
ment than industry, the distance of that place on the Hydafpes,
where Al.xander fitted out his fleet from the ocean, cannot
be less than a thousand Britilh miles. Of this estenfive region

a considerable portion, particularly the upper Delta, stretching S E C T.
from the capital of the ancient Malli, now Moultan, to Patala, ..
the modern Tatta, is diltinguifhed for its fertility and popu-
lation ".

SooN after he reached the ocean, Alexander, satisfied with

having accompliflied this arduous undertaking, led his army by
land back to Persia. The command of the fleet, with a confi-
derable body of troops on board of it, he left to Nearchus, who,
after a coasting voyage of seven months, conducted it safely up
the Persian Gulf into the Euphrates'.

IN this manner did Alexander first open the knowledge of

India to the people of Europe, and an extensive diftri: of it
was surveyed with greater accuracy than could have been ex-
peced from the thort time he remained in that country. Fortu-
nately an exat account, not only of his military operations,
but of every thing worthy of notice in the countries where
they were carried on, was recorded in the Memoirs or Journals
of three of his principal officers, Ptolemy the son of Lagus,
Ariftobulus, and Nearchus. The two former have not indeed
reached our times, but it is probable that the molf important
fads which they contained, are preserved, as Arrian professes
to have followed them as his guides in his History of the Ex-
pedition of Alexander ; a work which, though composed
long after Greece had loft its liberty, and in an age wher.

S E C T. genius and taste were on the decline, is not unworthy the purest
,__ times of Attic literature.

WITH rcfped to the general state of India, we learn from

thele writers, that in the age of Alexander, though there was not
eltablilhed in it any powerful empire, resembling that which in
modern times firetched its dominion from the Indus almost to,
Cape Comorin, it was even then formed into monarchies of con-
fiderable extent. The king of the Prafij was prepared on the
banks of the Ganges to oppose the Macedonians, with an army
of twenty thousand cavalry, two thousand armed chariots, and
a great number of elephants'. The territory of which Alex-
ander constituted Porus the sovereign, is said to have contained
no fewer than two thousand towns a. Even in the most re-
ftridted sense that can be given to the vague indefinite appella-
tions of nations and toans, an idea is conveyed of a very great
degree of population. As the fleet failed down the river, the
country on each fide was found to be in no refpeC inferior to
that of which the government was committed to Porus.

IT was likewise from the Memoirs of the fame officers that

Europe derived its firfi authentic information concerning the
climate, the foil, the productions, and the inhabitants of India;
and in a country where the manners, the cufloms, and even
the dress of the people are almost as permanent and invariable
as the face of nature itself, it is wonderful how exactly the
descriptions given by Alexander's officers delineate what we
now behold in India, at the distance of two thousand years.

The

The stated change of seasons, now known by the name of S E C T.
MonSoots; the periodical rains; the swelling of the rivers; ,
the inundations which there occasion; the appearance of the
country during their continuance; are particularly mentioned
and described. No less accurate are the descriptions which
they have given of the inhabitants, their delicate and slender
form, their dark complexion, their black uncurled hair, their
garments of cotton, their living entirely upon vegetable food,
their division into separate tribes or ca/ls, the members of which
never intermarry, the custom of wives burning themselves with
their deceased hufbandsi and many other particulars, in all which
they perfectly resemble the modern Hindoos. To enter into
any detail with refpeL to these in this place would be pre-
mature; but as-the subjet, though curious and interesting,
will lead unavoidably into discussions not well suited to the
nature of an historical work, I &all reserve my ideas concern-
ing it for an Appendix. whichi I purpoe. to annex to this
Disquisition; and hope they may contribute to throw fame
additional light upon.the origin and nature of the commerce
with India.

Muc as the Western world was indebted for its knowledge

of India to the expedition of Alexander, it was only a stall
portion of that vast continent which he explored. His operatiobs
did not extend beyond the modern province of Lahor, and the
countries on the banks of the Indus from Moultan to the sea.
These, however, were surveyed with that degree of accuracy
which I have already described; and it is a circumstance not
unworthy of notice, that this diftri& of India which Europeans

sirs,

I1

5 E C T. first entered, and with which they were best acquainted in

CL-^-, ancient times, is now less known than almost any part of that

continent', neither commerce nor war, to which, in every age,
geography is chiefly indebted for its improvement, having led
any nation of Europe to frequent or explore it.

IF an untimely death had not put a period to the reign of

the Macedonian hero, India, we have reason to think, would
have been more fully explored by the ancients, and the Euro-
pean dominion would have been eltablilhed there two thousand
years sooner. When Alexander invaded India, he had some-
thing more in view than a transient incursion. It was his
objet to annex that extensive and opulent country to his em-
pire, and though the refratory spirit of his army obliged him,
at that time, to suspend the prosecution of his plan, he was
far from relinquilhing it. To exhibit a general view of the
measures which he adopted for this purpose, and to point out
their propriety and probable success, is not foreign from the
fubje& of this Disquisition, and will convey a more jut idea
than is usually entertained, of the original genius and extent
of political wisdom which diftinguilhed this illustrious man.

WHEN Alexander became master of the Persian empire, he

early perceived, that with all the power of his hereditary do-
minions, reinforced by the troops which the ascendant he had
acquired over the various states of Greece might enable him
to raise there, he could not hope to retain in fubjeAion territo-
ries so extensive and populous; that to render his authority

Rcnncll Mem. 114.

secure

secure and permanent, it must be eftablilied in the affection S E C T.
of the nations which he had subdued, and maintained by their -
arms; and that in order to acquire this advantage, all diftinc-
tions between the vi&ors and vanquihied muff be abolished,
and his European and Asiatic fubjecs muff be incorporated,
and become one people, by obeying the fame laws, and by
adopting the fame manners, institutions, and discipline.

LIBERAL as this plan of policy was, and well adapted to

accoinplifh what he had in view, nothing could be more repug-
nant to the ideas and prejudices of his countrymen. The Greeks
had such an high opinion of the pre-eminence to which they
were raised by civilization and science, that they seem hardly
to have acknowledged the reft of mankind to be of the fame
species with themselves. To every other people they gave
the degrading appeliation of Barbarians, and, in consequence
of their own boased superiority, they aflerted a right of domi-
nion over them, in the fame manner as the foul has over the
body, and men have over irrational animals. Extravagant as
this pretension may now appear, it found admission, to the
disgrace of ancient philosophy, into all the schools. Aristotle,
full of this opinion, in support of which he employs arguments
more subtle than solid °, advised Alexander to govern the
Greeks like fubjeds, and the Barbarians as slaves; to confider
the former as companions, the latter as creatures of an inferior
nature D. But the sentiments of the pupil were more enlarged

S E C T. than thole of his master, and his experience in governing men

L -..,_- taught the monarch what the speculative science of the phiofo-

pher did not discover. Soon after the vicory at Arbela, Alexan-
der himself, and by his persuasion many of his officers, assumed
the Persian dress, and conformed to several of their customs.
At the fame time he encouraged the Persian nobles to imitate
the manners of the Macedonians, to learn the Greek language,
and to acquire a relish for the beauties of the elegant writers
in that tongue, which were then universally studied and admired.
In order to render the union more complete, he resolved to
marry one of the daughters of Darius, and chose wives for a
hundred of his principal officers in the mot illustrious Persian
families. Their nuptials were celebrated with great pomp and
festivity, and with high exultation of the conquered people.
In imitation of them, above ten thousand Macedonians of
inferior rank married Persian women, to each of whom
Alexander gave nuptial presents, as a testimony of his appro-
bation of their condud'.

BUT affiduoully as Alexander laboured to unite his European

and Asiatic fubjeas by the most indissoluble ties, he did not
trust entirely to the success of that measure for the security of
his new conquets. In every province which he subdued, he
made choice of proper stations, where he built and fortified
cities, in which he placed garrisons, composed partly of such of
the natives as conformed to the Grecian manners and discipline,
and partly of such of his European fubjeds, as were worn out

with the fatigues of service, and wifhed-for repose, and a S E C T.
permanent establishment. These cities were numerous, and ,
served not only as a chain of polls to keep open the communi-
cation between the different provinces of his dominions, but as
places of strength to over-awe and curb the conquered people.
Thirty thousand of his new fubjeds who had been disciplined in
these cities, and armed after the European fashion, appeared before
Alexander in Susa, and were formed by him into that compa&
solid body of infantry, known by the name of the Phalanx,
which constituted the strength of a Macedonian army. But
in order to secure entire authority over this new corps, as well
as to render it more effeaive, he appointed that every officer
in it entrusted with command, either superior or subaltern,
ihould be European. As the ingenuity of mankind naturally
has recourse in similar situations to the fame expedients, the
European powers, who now in their Indian territories employ
numerous bodies of the natives in their service, have, in form-
ing the establishment of there troops, adopted the fame maxims;
and, probably without knowing it, have modelled their batta-
lions of Seapoys upon the fame principles as Alexander did his
Phalanx of Persians.

TiE farther Alexander pufled his cbnquefts from the banks

of the Euphrates, which may be confidered as the center of
his dominions, hefound it necessary to build and to fortify a greater
number of cities. Several of there to the East and South of
the Caspian sea are mentioned by ancient authors; and in India
itself, he founded two cities on the banks of the Hydafpcs,
and a third on the Acefines, both navigable rivers, which, after

E uniting

S E C T. uniting their streams, fall into the Indus'. From the choice

of such situations, it is obvious that he intended, by means of
these cities, to keep open a communication with India, not only
by land, but by Lea. It was chiefly with a view to the latter
of these objects, (as I have already observed,) that he examined
the navigation of the Indus with so much attention. With
the fame view, on his return to Susa, he, in person, surveyed
the courie of the Euphrates and Tigris, and gave directions to
remove the cataracts or dams, with which the ancient monarchs
of Persia, induced by a peculiar precept of their religion, which
enjoined them to guard with the utmost care against defiling
any of the elements, had construCted near the mouths of these
rivers, in order to shut out their fubjeds from any access to
the ocean . By opening the navigation in this manner, he
proposed, that the valuable commodities of India flould be
conveyed from the Persian Gulf into the interior parts of his
Asiatic dominions, while by the Arabian Gulf they should be
carried to Alexandria, and distributed to the reft of the world.

GRAND and extensive as these schemes were, the precautions

employed, and the arrangements made for carrying them into
execution, were so various and so proper, that Alexander had
good reason to entertain sanguine hopes of their proving fuc-
cefsful. At the time when the mutinous spirit of his soldiers
obliged him to relinquish his operations in India, he was
not thirty years of age complete. At this enterprizing period
of life, a prince, of a spirit so active, persevering, and indefati-

gable, muRf have soon found means to refuime a favourite S E C T.
meafurc on which he had been long intent. If he had invaded
India a fccond time, he would not, as formerly, have been
obliged to force his way through hostile and unexplored regions,
opposcd at every flep by nations and tribes of Barbarians,
whose names iad never reached Greece. All Asia, from the
shores of the Ionian sea to the banks of the Hyphafis, would -
then have been fubje& to his dominion; and through that im-
mense stretch of country he had eftablifled such a chain of
cities, or fortified flations ', that his armies might have continued
their march with safety, and have found a regular succession of
magazines provided for their subsistence. Nor would it have
been difficult for him to bring into the field forces flfficient to
have atchicved the conquest of a country so populous and ex-
tensive as India. Having armed and disciplined his fubjets
in the East like Europeans, they would have been ambitious
to imitate and to equal their inltrunors, and Alexander might
have drawn recruits, not from his scanty domains in Macedonia
and Greece, but from the vast regions of Asia, which, in every
age, has covered the earth, and aftoniflied mankind with its
numerous armies. When at the head of such a formidable
power he had reached the confines of India, he might have
entered it under circumstances very different from those in
his first expedition. He had secured a firm footing there,
partly by means of the garrisons which he left in the three cities
which he hhd built and fortified, and partly by his alliance
with Taxiles and Porus. There two Indian princes, won by
Alexander's humanity and benelicence, which, as they were

virtues

S E C T. virtues seldom displayed in the ancient mode of carrying on
._'_s war, excited of course an higher degree of admiration and

gratitude, had continued steady in their attachment to the
Macedonians. Re-inforced by their troops, and guided by their
information as well as by the experience which he had ac-
quired in his former campaigns, Alexander must have made
rapid progress in a country, where every invade;, from his time
to the present age, has proved. successful.

BUT tills and all his other splendid faemes were termi-

nated at once by his untimely death. In consequence of that,
however, events took place, which illustrate and confirm the
jutnefs of the preceding speculations and conjeaures by evi-
dence the mot firiking and fatisfaaory. When that great
empire, which the superior genius of Alexander had kept
united and in fubjetion, no longer felt his superintending
controul, it broke into pieces, and its various provinces were
seized by his principal officers, and parcelled out among them.
From ambition, emulation, and personal animosity, they soon
turned their arms againit one another; and as several of the
leaders were equally eminent for political abilities and for
military skill, the contest was maintained long, and carried on
with frequent vicissitudes of fortune. Amidst the various con-
vullions and revolutions which these occasioned, it was found
that the measures of Alexander for the preservation of his
ccnquefts had been concerted with such sagacity, that upon
the final restoration of tranquillity, the Macedonian dominion
continued to be established in every part of Asia, and not one
province had ihaken off the yoke. Even India, the most re-

mote

mote of Alcxander's conquests, quietly submitted to Pytho the S E C T.
son of Agenor, and afterwards to Seleucus, who fucceflively
obtained dominion over that part of Asia. Porus and Taxiles,
notwithfianding the death of their benefator, neither declined
submission to the authority of the Macedonians, nor made any
attempt to recover independence.

DURING the contests for power and superiority among the

successors of Alexander, Seleucus, who, in every effort of en-
tcrprifing ambition, was inferior to none of them, having ren-
dered himself master of all the provinces of the Persian empire
comprehended under the name of Upper Asia, confidered those
countries of India which had been subdued by Alexander, as
belonging to that portion of the Macedonian empire of which
he was now the sovereign. Seleucus, like all the officers formed
under Alexander, entertained such high ideas of the advantages
which might be derived from a commercial intercourse with
India, as induced him to march into that country, partly with
a view of eftablilhing his own authority there, and partly in
order to curb Sandracottus, who having lately acquired the
obvereignty of the Prafij, a powerful nation on the banks of
the Ganges, threatened to attack the Macedonians, whose
Indian territories bordered on his dominions. Unfortunately,
no account of this expedition, which seems to have been fplen-
did and successful, has reached our times. All we know of it
is, that he advanced considerably beyond the utmost boundary
of Alexander's progress in India', and would probably have
proceeded much farther if he had not been constrained to flop

S E C T. short in his career in order to oppose Antigonus, who was
._-, preparing to invade his dominions at the head of a formi-

dable army. Before he begun his march towards the
Euphrates, he concluded a treaty with Sandracottus; in confe-
quence of which, that monarch quietly retained the kingdom
he had acquired. But the powcr and poffeflions of the Mace-
donians seem to have remained unimpaired during the reign of
Seleucus, which terminated forty-two years after the death of
Alexander.

WITn a view of cultivating a friendly intercourse with San-

dracottus, Seleucus made choice of Megafthenes, an officer,
who, from his having accompanied Alexander in his expedition
into India, had rome knowledge of the state of the country, and
the manners of its inhabitants, and sent him as his ambassador
to Palibothra'. In this famous capital of the Prafij, situated
on the banks of the Ganges, Mcgafthenes residcd several years,
and was probably the first European who ever beheld that
mighty river, far superior to any of the ancient continent in
magnitude ', and no less diltinguilhed by the fertility of the
countries through which it flows. This journey of Megafthenes
to Palibothra made Europeans acquainted with a large extent
of country, of which they had not hitherto any knowledge;
for Alexander did not advance farther towards the south-east,
than that part of the river Hydraotes or Rasivee, where the
modern city of Lahore is situated, and Paliibothra, the site of
which, as it is a capital position in the geography of ancient
India, I have investigated with the utmost attention, appears

to me the fame with that of the modern city of Allahabad, at S E C T.,
the confluence of the two great rivers, Jumna and Ganges . ,
As the road from Lahore to Allahabad runs through some of
the most cultivated and opulent provinces of India, the more
the country was explored the idea of its value rose higher.
Accordingly, what Megafthcnes observcd during his progress to
Palibothra, and his residence there, made such an impreflion
upon his own mind, as induced him to publifl an ample
account of India, in order to make his countrymen more
thoroughly acquainted with its importance. From his writings
the ancients seem to have derived almost all their knowledge of
the interior state of India, and from comparing the three most
ample accounts of it, by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and Arrian,
they appear manifestly, from their near resemblance, to be a
transcript of his words. But, unfortunately, Megafthenes
was so fond of the marvellous, that he mingled with the truths
which he related many extravagant ficions; and to him may
be traced up the fabulous tales of men with ears so large that
they could wrap themcflves up in them, of others with a tingle
eye, without mouths, without noses, with long feet, and toes
turned backwards, of people only three spans in height, of
wild men with heads in the shape of a wedge, of ants as large
as foxes that dug up gold, and many other things no less won-
defiul . The cxtrats from his narrative which have been
tranfinitted to us by Straho, Arrian, and other writers, seem not
to be entitled to credit, unlcfs when they arc `upported by inter-
nal evidence, and confirmted by the tefiimony of other ancient
authors, or when they coincide with the experience of modern
times. His account, however, of the dincenfions and geo-

_, _ . power and opulence of the Prafij perfectly resembles that which

might have been given of some of the greater Rates in the mo-
dem Indoflan, before the establishment of the Mahomedan or
European power in India, and is consonant to the accounts which
Alexander had received concerning that people. He was inform-
ed that they were ready to oppose him on the banks of the
Ganges, with an army consisting of twenty thousand cavalry, two
hundred thousand infantry, and two thousand armed chariots';
and Megafthenes relates, that he had an audience of Sandra-
cottus in a place where he was encamped with an army of
four hundred thousand men'. The enormous dimensions
which he assigns to Palibothra, of no less than ten miles in
length, and two in breadth, and surrounded by walls in which
there were five hundred and seventy towers, and fixty-four
gates, would probably have been ranked by Europeans among
the wonders which he delighted to relate, if they were not
now well acquainted with the rambling manner in which the
cities of India are built, and did not know with certainty that,
both in former and in the present times, it might boast of cities
fill more extenfiveb.

THIS embassy of Megafihenes to Sandracottus, and another

of Daimachus to his son and successor Allitrochidas, are the
last tranfacions of the Syrian monarchs with India, of which
we have any account'. Nor can we either fix with accuracy the

India were wrested from them. It is probable that they __
were obliged to abandon that country soon after the death
of Seleucus'.

BUT though the great monarchs of Syria loft, about this pe-

riod, those provinces in India which had been fubje& to their
dominion, the Greeks in a smaller kingdom, composed of some
fragments of Alexander's empire, still maintained an intercourse
with India, and even made some considerable acquisition of ter-
ritory there. This was the kingdom of Bacria, originally fubjecd
to Seleucus, but wrested from his son or grandson, and rendered
an independent state, about fixty-nine years after the death of
Alexander. Concerning the tranfaitions of this kingdom, we
must reft satisfied with gleaning a few imperfect hints in
ancient authors. From them we learn that its commerce
with India was great; that the conquests of the Baarian kings
in that country were more extensive than those of Alexander
hinfclf, and particularly that they recovered poffeflion of the
diftri& near the mouth of the Indus, which he had sub-
dued d. Each of the fix princes who reigned in Batria, car-
ried on military operations in India with such success, that they

of the conquests which they had made, as well as of the ex-
tcnlive dominions over which they reigned, some of them

S E C T. assumed the lofty title of Great King, which diftinguiihed the

. Persian monarchs in the days of their highest splendor. But

we lhculd not have known how long this kingdom of Ba&ria
fubfilted, or in what manner it terminated, if M. de Guigne&
had not called in the historians of China to supply the defets
of the Greek anid Roman writers. By them we are informed,
that about one hundred and twenty-fix years before the Chris-
tian era, a powerful horde of Tartars, pufted from their
native feats on the confines of.China, and obliged to move
towards the weft by the pressure of a more numerous body
that rolled on behind them, passed the Jaxartes, and pouring in
upon Baaria, like an irreliftible torrent, overwhelmed that
kingdom, and put an end to the dominion of the 'Greeks
there, after it had been established near one hundred and thirty
)ears '.

FROM. this time until the close of the fifteenth century,

when the Portuguese, by doubling the Cape of Good Hope,
opened a new communication with the East, and carried their
victorious arms into every part of India, no European power
acquired territory, or eftablified its dominion there. Dur-
ing this long period, of more than lixteen hundred years, all
schemes of conqucft in India seem to have been totally relin-
quilied, and nothing more was aimed at by any nation, than
to fccurc an intercourse of trade with that opulent country.

IT was in Egypt that the feat of this intercourse was efla-
blilchd; and it is not without surprise that we observe how

roon and how regularly the commerce with the East came to S E C T.
be carried on by that channel, in which the sagacity of Alex- '
ander destined it to flow. Ptolemy, the Ion of Lagus, as soon
as he took poffelion of Egypt, eftabli{hed the feat of govern-
mcnt in Alexandria. By some exertions of authority, and
many ads of liberality, but chiefly by the fame of his mild
and equal administration, he drew such a number of inhabit-
ants to this favourite residence, that it soon became a populous
and wealthy city. As Ptolemy defenred and had poffefled the
confidence of Alexander more perfe&ly than any of his officers,
he knew well that his chief objea in founding Alexandria was
to fccure the advantages arising from the trade with India. A
long and prosperous reign was favourable to the prosecution
of that objet, and though ancient authors have not enabled us
to trace the steps which the first Ptolemy took for this purpose,
we have a firiking evidence of his extraordinary attention to
naval affairs, in his erecing the light-houle on the island of
Pharos, at the mouth of the harbour of Alexandria <, a work of
such magnificence as to be reckoned one of the fcven wonders
of the world. With rcfpet to the commercial arrangements
of his son Ptolemy Philadelphus, we have more perfect inform-
ation. In order to bring the trade with India (which began
to revive at Tyre, its ancient flation ",) to centre in Alexandria,
he fct about forming a canal, an hundred cubits in breadlh, and
thirty cubits in depth, between Arfinoe on the Red Sea, not
far from the lituation of the modern Suez, and the Peluliac or
caltcrn branch of the Nile, by means of which the produiions
of India might have been conveyed to that capital wholly by

S E C T. water. But either on account of foine danger apprehended

from completing it, that work was never finised; or from the
flow and dangerous navigation towards the northern extremity
of the Red Sea, this canal was found to be of so little use,
that in order to facilitate the communication with India, he
built a city on the welt coast of that sea, almost under the
Tropic, to which he gave the name of Berenice . This new
city soon became the staple of the trade with India k. From
Berenice the goods were transported by land to Coptos, a city
three miles distant from the Nile, but which had a communica-
tion with that river by a navigable canal, of which there are
still some remains ', and thence carried down the stream to
Alexandria. The distance between Berenice and Coptos was,
according to Pliny, two hundred and fifty-eight Roman miles,
and the road lay through the defart of Thebais, almost entirely
destitute of water. But the attention of a powerful monarch
made provision for supplying this want, by searching for
springs, and wherever these were found he built inns, or more
probably in the eaflern ifile caravanferas, for the accommoda-
tion of merchants '. In this channel the intercourse between
the East and Weft continued to be carried on during two hun-
dred and fifty years, as long as Egypt remained an independent
kingdom.

Berenice, and failing, according to the ancient mode of navi-

gation, along the Arabian ihore, to the promontory Syagrus S E C T.
(now Cape Ralalgate), held their course along the coast of .
Persia, either directly to Pattala (now Tatta) at the head of
the lower Delta of the Indus, or to some other emporium on
the weft coast of India. To this part of India which Alex-
ander had visitcd and subdued, the commerce under the pro-
tetion of the Egyptian monarchs seems to have been confined
for a considerable time. Afterwards a more convenient course
was followed, and from Cape Rafalgate veflels failed in a
diret course to Zizerus. This, according to M. de Montef-
quieu °, was the kingdom of Sigertis, on the Tea coast adjacent
to the mouth of the Indus, conquered by the Greek monarchs
of Batria; according to Major Rennell°, it was a port on the
northern part of the Malabar coast. Ancient authors have not
conveyed such information as will enable us to pronounce
with certainty, which of there two opposite opinions is best
founded. Nor can we point out with accuracy, what were the
other ports in India which the merchants from Berenice fre-
quented, when that trade was first opened. As they failed in
vcffels of linall burden, which crept timidly along the coast,
it is probable that their voyages were circumscribed within very
narrow limits, and that under the Ptolemies no considerable
progress was made in the dilcovery of India P.

FROM this monopoly of the commerce by sea between the
east and weft, which Egypt long enjoyed, it derived that

extra-

S E C T. extraordinary degree of opulence and power for which it was

conspicuous. In modern times, acquainted with the vigilant
and enterprizing activity of commercial rivallhip, there is
hirdly any circumfiance in ancient story which appears more
liirpriling, than that the sovereigns of Egypt should have
been permitted to engross this lucrative trade without com-
petition, or any attempt to wrest it out of their hands; efpe-
cially as the powerfll monarchs of Syria might, from the
Perlian Gulf, have carried on an intercourse with the fame
parts of India, by a shorter and safer course of navigation.
Different considerations seem to have induced them so tamely
to relinquish all the obvious advantages of this commerce.
The kings of Egypt, by their attention to maritime affairs,
Ihad formed a powerful fleet, which gave them such decided
command of the fca, that they could have crushed with cafe
any rival in trade. No commercial intercourse seems ever to
have been carried on by sea between Persia and India. The
Persians had such an iofupcrable aversion to that clement, or
were so much afraid of foreign invasion, that their monarchs
(as I have already observed) obftruled the navigation of the
great rivers, which gave access to the interior parts of the
country, by artificial works. As their fubjeas, however, were
no less desirous than the people around them, to polfefs the
valuabcl productions and elegant manufacures of India, these
were conveyed to all the parts of their extensive dominions by
land-carriage. The commodities destined for the supply of
the northern provinces, were transported on camels from the
b)anks of the Indus to those of the Oxus, down the fiream of
which they were carried to the Caspian sea, and distributed,

4 partly

partly by land-carriage, and partly by navigable rivers, through S E C T.
the different countries, bounded on one hand by the Caf- t..- ,
pian, and on the other by the Euxine, sea . The commodities
of India intended for the southern and interior provinces, pro-
ceeded by land from the Carpian gates to some of the great
rivers, by which they were circulated through every part of the
country. This was the ancient mode of intercourse with India,
while the Persian empire was governed by its-native princes;
and it has been observed in every age, that when any branch
of commerce has got into a certain channel, although it may
be neither the most proper nor the most commodious one,
it requires long time, and considerable efforts, to give it a
different diretion '.

To all these reasons for suffering the monarchs of Egypt to

continue in the undisturbed poffeflion of the trade with India
by sea, another may be added. Many of the ancients, by an
error in geography extremely unaccountable, and in which
they persisted, notwithstanding repeated opportunities of ob-
taining more accurate information, believed the Caspian sea to
be a branch of the great Northern Ocean, and the kings of
Syria might hope by that means to open a communication
with Europe, and to circulate through it the valuable produc-
tions of the East, without intruding into those seas, the navi-
gation of which the Egyptian monarchs Ieemed to confider as
their exclusive right. This idea had been early formed by the
Greeks, when they became mailers of Asia. Seleucus Nicator,

S E C T. the first and most sagacious of the Syrian kings, at the time

. when he was assassinated, entertained thoughts of forming a

junction between the Caspian and Euxine seas by a canal',
and if this could have been effe&ed, his fubjeLs, besides the
extension of their trade in Europe, might have supplied all the
countries in the North of Asia, on the coast of the Euxine
lca, as well as many of those which itretch eastward from the
Caspian, with the productions of India. As those countries,
though now thinly inhabited by a miserable race of men, def-
titute of industry and of wealth, were in ancient times ex-
tremely populous, and filled with great and opulent cities, this
muff have been confidered as a branch of commerce of such
magnitude and value, as to render the securing of it an object
worthy the attention of the most powerful monarch.

BUT while the monarchs of Egypt and Syria laboured with

emulation and ardour to secure to their fubjeds all the advan-
tages of the Indian trade, a power arose in the Weft which
proved fatal to both. The Romans, by the vigour of their
military institutions, and the wisdom of their political conduc,
having rendered themselves mailers of all Italy and Sicily,
soon overturned the rival republic of Carthage, fubjeded Ma-
A. C. 65. cedonia and Greece, extended their dominion over Syria,

and at las turned their victorious arms againit Egypt, the
only kingdom remaining of those eflablilhed by the successors
of Alexander the Great. After a series of events, which be-
long not lo the subjea of this Disquisition, Egypt was annexed

to the Roman empire, and reduced into the form of a Roman S E C T.
province by Augustus. Aware of its great importance, he, ,
with that provident sagacity which diftinguifihes his character, A. C. 30.
not only reserved it as one of the provinces subjet immedi-
ately to Imperial authority, but by various precautions, well
known to every scholar, provided for its security. This extra-
ordinary solicitude seems to have proceeded not only from con-
fidering Egypt as one of the chief granaries on which the
capital depended for subsistence, but as the feat of that lucrative
commerce which had enabled its ancient monarchs to amass
such enormous wealth, as excited the admiration and envy of
other princes, and produced, when brought into the treasury of
the empire, an alteration in the value of property, and the
state of manners, in Rome itself.

Inte rcourfJc with India, from the EJlabli/hment of the Roman

Dominion in Egypt, to the Con queJf of that Kingdom by the
Mlahonmedans.
U PON the conquest of Egypt by the Romans, and the S E C T.

reduction of that kingdom to a province of their

empire, the trade with India continued to be carried on in the
fame mode, under their powerful protection: Rome, enriched
with the spoils and the tribute of almost all the known world,
had acquired a tafle for luxuries of every kind. Among
people of this dcfcription, the productions of India have

G 2 always

S E C T. always been held in the highest estimation. The capital of

. the greatest empire ever eftablithed ,in Europe, filled with

citizens who had now no occupation, but to enjoy and dissipate
the wealth accumulated by their ancestors, demanded every
thing elegant, rare, or costly, which that remote region could
furnilh, in order to support its pomp, or heighten its pleasures.
To supply this demand, new and extraordinary efforts became
requisite, and the commerce with India increased to a degree,
which (as I have observed in another place') will appear
astonishing even to the present age, in which that branch of
trade has been extended far beyond the pracice or conception
of any former period.

BESIDES the Indian commodities imported into the capital

of the empire from Egypt, the Romans received an additional
supply of them by another mode of conveyance. From the
earliest times, there seems to have been some communication
between Alefopotamia, and other provinces on the banks of the
Euphrates, and those parts of Syria and Palestine, which lay near
the Mediterranean. The migration of Abram from Ur, of the
Chaldees to Sichem in the land of Canaan, is an infRance of
this 5. The journey through the defart, which separated
there countries, was much facilitated by its affording a station
abounding with water, ana capable of cultivation. As the in-
tercourfe increased, the pofeffion of this fiation became an
objec of so much importance, that Solomon, when he turned
his attention towards the extension of commerce among his

fubjeas, built a fenced city there'. Its Syrian name of radmor S E C T.
in the wilderness, and its Greek one of Palmyra, are both de-
fcriptive of its situation in a spot adorned with palm-trees.
This is plentifully supplied with water, and surrounded by a
portion of fertile land, which (though of no great extent) render
it a delightful habitation in the midit of barren sands ant an
inhospitable defart. Its happy position, at the distance of little
more than sixty miles from the river Euphrates, and of two
hundred and three miles from the nearest coast of the Mediter-
ranean, induced its inhabitants to enter with ardour into the
trade of conveying commodities from ones of there to the
other. As the molt valuable productions of India, brought up
the Euphrates from the Persian Gulf, are of such small bulk as
to bear the expence of a long land-carriage, this trade soon
became so considerable that the opulence and power of Palmyra
increased rapidly. Its government was of the form which is
best suited to the genius of a commercial city, republican; and
from the peculiar advantages of its situation, as well as the
spirit of its inhabitants, it long maintained its independence,
though surrounded by powerful and ambitious neighbours.
Under the Syrian monarchs descended fromSeleucus it attained to
its highest degree of splendour and wealth, one great source of
which seems to have been the supplying their fubjecs with Indian
commodities. When Syria submitted to the irresistible arms of
Rome, Palmyra continued upwards of two centuries a free Rate,
and its friendship wascourted with emulation and solicitude by the
Romans, and their rivals for empire, the Partiians. That it traded

S E C T. of the empire received the produ&ions of India, we learn from

A Appian, an author of good credit'. But in tracing the pro-
grcfs of the commerce of the ancients with the East, I should
not have ventured, upon his single tetimony, to mention this
among the channels of note in which it was carried on, if a
singular discovery, for which we are indebted to the liberal
curiosity and enterprizing spirit of our own countrymen, did not
confirm and illultrate what he relates. Towards the close of
the last century, some gentlemen of the Engliih fa&ory at
Aleppo, incited by what they heard in the East concerning the
wonderful ruins of Palmyra, ventured, notwithstanding the fa-
tigue and danger of a journey through the dclart, to visit them.
To their altonifhment they beheld a fertile spot of some miles
in extent, arising like an island out of a vast plain of sand,
covered with the remains of temples, porticoes, aqueducts, and
other public works, which in magnificence and splendour, and
some of them in elegance, were not unworthy of Athens or of
Rome in their most prosperous slate. Allured by their defcrip-
tion of them, about lixty years thereafter, a party of more
enlightened travellers, having reviewed the ruins of Palmyra
with greater attention and more scientific lkill, declared that
what they beheld there exceeded the most exalted ideas which
they had formed concerning it'.

FROM both these accounts, as well as from recollecing the
extraordinary degree of power to which Palmyra had attained,

Alia Minor were conquered by its arms; when Odenatus, its __
chief magistrate, was decorated with the Imperial purple, and
Zenobia contended for the dominion of the East with Rome
under one of its molt warlike Emperors, it is evident, that a
slate which could derive little importance from its original ter-
ritory, must have owed its aggrandizement to the opulence
acquired by extensive commerce. Of this the Indian trade
was undoubtedlythe most considerable, and mnof lucrativebranch.
But it is a cruel mortification, in searching for what is infirudive
in the history of past times, to find that the exploits of conquerors
who have desolated the earth, and tle freaks of tyrants who
have rendered nations unhappy, are recorded with minute and
often disgusting accuracy, while the discovery of useful arts,
and the progress of the mofi beneficial branches of commerce,
are pafled over in silence, and lilffered to fink into oblivion.

AFTER the conquest of Palmyra by Aurelian, trade never

revived there. At present a few miserable huts of beggarly
Arabs are fcattcrcd in the courts of its stately temples, or
deform its elegant porticoes; and exhibit an humiliating con-
traft to its ancient magnificence.

BUT while the merchants of Egypt and Syria exerted their

adcivity in order to fuipply the increasing demands of Rome for
Indian commodities, and vied with each other in their efforts,
the eagerness of gain (as Pliny observes) brought India itself
nearer to the reft of the world. In the course of their voyages
to that country, the Greek and Egyptian pilots could not fail

47
6

to

S E C T. to observe the regular filfting of the periodical winds or mon-

II.
L-W soons, and how steadily they continued to blow during one

part of the year from the Ealf, and during the other from the
Weft. Encouraged by attending to this circumItance, Hippalus,
the commander of a ship engaged in the Indian trade, ventured,
about four-score years after Egypt was annexed to the Roman
empire, to relinquish the flow and circuitous course which I have
described, and firetching boldly from the mouth of the Arabian
Gulf across the ocean, was carried by the wetern monsoon to
Mufiris, a harbour in that part of India, now known by the
name of the Malabar coast.

THIS route to India was held to be a discovery of fucht

importance, that in order to perpetuate the memory of the
inventor, the name of Hippalus was given to the wind which
enabled him to perform the voyage . As this was one of the
greatest efforts of navigation in the ancient world, and opened
the bet communication by sea between the EaR and Weft that
was known for fourteen hundred years, it merits a particular
description. Fortunately Pliny has enabled us to give it with a
degree of accuracy, which.can teldom be attained in tracing the
naval or commercial operations of the ancients. From Alex-
andria (he observes) to Juliopolis is two miles; there the cargo
deflined for India is embarked on the Nile, and is carried to
Coptos, which is distant three hundred and three miles, and the
.,~; ~ voyage is usually accomplished in twelve days. From Coptos

goods are conveyed to Berenice on the Arabian Gulf, halting

Perip. Mar. Erythr. p. 12.

at

at different stations regulated according to the convenency of S E C T.
watering. The distance between there cities is two hundred _-..
and fifty-eight miles. On account of the heat, the caravan
travels only during the night, and the journey is finished on
the twelfth day. From Berenice, .{hips take their departure
about midsummer, and in thirty days reach Ocelis (Gella) at the
mouth of the Arabian Gulf, or Cane (Cape Fartaque) on the
coast of Arabia Felix. Thence they fail in forty days to Mufiris,
the first emporium in India. They begin their voyage home-
wards early in the Egyptian month Thibi, which answers to
our December; they fail with a north-east wind, and when they
enter the Arabian Gulf meet with a south or south-west wind,
and thus complete the voyage in less than a year '.

THE account which Pliny gives of Mufiris, and of Barace, ,

another harbour not far distant, which was likewise frequented
by the ships from Berenice, as being both so incommodious for
trade on account of the shallowness of the ports, that it became
necessary to discharge and take in the cargoes in small boats, does
not enable us to fix their position with perse& accuracy. This
description applies to many ports on the Malabar coast, but
from two circumstances mentioned by him; one, that they are
not far distant from Cottonara, the country which produces
pepper in great abundance; and the other, that in failing towards
them the course lay near Nitrias, the tfation of the pirates; I
adopt the opinion of Major Rennell, that they were situated
foinewhere between Goa and Tellicherry, and that probably

As in there two ports was the principal faple of the trade

between Egypt and India, when in its most flourifiing state,
this seems to be the proper place for inquiring into the nature
of the commerce which the ancients, particularly the Romans,
carried on with that country, and for enumerating the com-
modities molt in request, which they imported from it. But
as the operations of commerce, and the mode of regulating it,
were little attended tc in those Rates of antiquity, of whose
tranfaations we have any accurate knowledge; their historians
hardly enter into any detail concerning a subjed of such fubor-
dinate importance in their political system, and it is mostly
from brief hints, detached sacs, and incidental observations,
that we can gather information concerning it .

IN every age, it has been a commerce of luxury, rather than of

necessity, which has been carried on between Europe and India.
Its elegant manufacures, spices, and precious ftoncs, are neither
obje&s of desire to nations of simple manners, nor are such
nations poffefLed of wealth sufficient to purchase them. But at
the time the Romans became masters of the Indian trade, they
were not only (as I have already observed) in that sage of
society when men are eager to obtain every thing that can
render the enjoyment of life more exquisite, or add to its
splendour, but they had acquired all the fantastic taftes formed

by
so

by the caprice and extravagance of wealth. They were of S E C T.
consequence highly delighted with those new oljeAs of gra- _ ._
tification with which India supplied them in such abundance.
The productions of that country, natural as well as artificial,
fcein to have been much the fame in that age as in the present.
But the taste of the Romans in luxury differed in many refpe&s
from that of modern times, and of course their demands from
India differed considerably from ours.

IN order to convey an idea of their demands as complete as

poflible, I shall in the first place make Tome observations on the
three great articles of general importation from India. i. Spices
and aromatics. 2. Precious stones and pearls. 3. Silk. And
then I shall give some account (as far as I can venture to do it
from authentic information) of the assortment of cargoes, both
outward and homeward bound, for the vessels fitted out at
Berenice for different ports of India.

I. SPicES and aromatics. From the mode of religious

worship in the heathen world; from the incredible number of
their deities, and of the temples consecrated to them; the con-
fumption of frankincense and other aromatics which were
used in every sacred function, must have been very great.
But the vanity of men occasioned a greater consumption of
there fragrant substances than their piety. It was the custom
of the Romans to burn the bodies of their dead, and they
deemed it a display of magnificence, to cover, not only the body
but the funeral pile on which it was laid, with the most cosily
spices. At the funeral of Sylla, two hundred and ten burthens

S E C T. of spices were strewed upon the pile. Nero is reported to

, _. have burnt a quantity of cinnamon and cassia at the funeral of

Pappea, greater than the countries from which it was imported
produced in one year. We consume in heaps these precious
substances with the carcases of the dead (fays Pliny): We offer
them to the Gods only in grains '. It was not from India, I am
aware, but from Arabia, that aromatics were first imported into
Europe; and some of them, particularly frankincense, were pro-
duOtions of that country. But the Arabians were accustomed,
together with spices of native growth, to furnish foreign merchants
with others of higher value, which they brought from India, and
the regions beyond it. The commercial intercourse of the Arabi-
ans with the Eastern parts of Aia, was not only early (as has been
already obfcrved) but considerable. By means of their trading
caravans they conveyed into their own country all the valuable
productions of the Eal, among which, spices held a chief place.
In every ancient account of Indian commodities, spices and
aromatics of various kinds form a principal article'. Some
authors assert that the greater part of those purchased in Arabia
were not the growth of that country, but brought from India".
That this aifertion was well-founded, appears from what has
been observed in modern times. The frankincense of Arabia,
though reckoned the peculiar and mos precious producion of
the country, is much inferior in quality to that imported into
it from the Ealt; and it is chiefly with the latter, that the
Arabians at present supply the extensive demands of various

provinces of Asia for this commodity': It is upon good S E C T.
authority, then, that I have mentioned the inportation of spices _
as one of the most considerable branches of ancient commerce
with India.

II. PRECIOUS' sones, together with which pearls may be'

elaffed, seem to be the article next in value imported by the
Romans from the East. As these have no pretension to be
of any real use, their value arises entirely from their beauty
and their rarity, and even when estimated most moderately is
always high. But among nations far advanced in luxury,.
when they are deemed not only ornaments but marks of dif-
tincion, the vain and the opulent vie so eagerly with one
another for the poffeflion of them, that they rife in price to an
exorbitant and almost incredible height. Diamonds, though the
art of cutting them was imperfeCly known to the ancients, held
an high place in estimation among them as well as among us.
The comparative value of other precious sones varied accord-
ing to the diversity of tafes and the caprice of fashion. The
immense number of them mentioned by Pliny, and the la-
borious care with which he describes and arranges them °, will
altonilh, I Ihould suppose, the most skilful lapidary or jeweller
of modern times, and ihews the high reLueft in which they
were held by the Romans.

BUT among all the articles of luxury, the Romans seem to
have given the preference to pearls P. Persons of every rank.

S E C T. purchased them with eagerness; they were worn on every part

II. __ . of dress; and there is such a difference, both in size and in

value, among pearls, that while such as were large and of
superior luftrc adorned the wealthy and the great, finaller ones,
and of inferior quality, gratified the vanity of persons in more
humble Riations of life. Julius Cefar presented Servilia, the
mother of Brutus, with a pearl, for which he paid forty-eight
thousand four hundred and fifty-feven pounds. The famous
pearl ear-rings of Cleopatra were in value one hundred and sixty-
onc tllouflnd four hundred and fifty-eight pounds q. Precious
stones, it is true, as well as pearls, were found not only in
India, but in many different countries, and all were ransacked
in order to gratify the pride of Rome. India, however, fur-
nifled the chief part, and its producions were allowed to be
most abundant, diversified, and valuable.

111. ANOTHER prodution of India in great demand at

Rome, was silk ; and when we recollec the variety of elegant
fabrics into which it may be formed, and how much these
have added to the splendour of dress and furniture, we cannot
wonder at its being held in such estimation by a luxurious
people. The price it bore was exorbitant; but it was deemed
a dress too expensive and too delicate for men', and was
appropriated wholly to women of eminent rank and opulence.
This, however, did not render the demand for it less eager,
especially after the example of the diflolute Elagabalus intro-
duced the ife of it among the other sex, and accustomed men

to the disgrace (as the severity of ancient ideas accounted it) S E C T.
of wearing this effeminate garb. Two circumstances concern- J
ing the traffic of silk among the Romans merit observation.
Contrary to what usually takes place in the operations of trade,
the more general use of that commodity seems not to have
increased the quantity imported, in such proportion as to
answer the growing demand for it, and the price of silk was not
reduced during the courle of two hundred and fifty years fiom
the time of its being firit known in Rome. In the reign of
Aurelian, it still continued to be valued at its weight in gold.
This, it is probable, was owing to the mode in which that
commodity, was procured by the merchants of Alexandria.
They had no direc intercourse with China, the only country in
which the lilk-worm was then reared, and its labour rendered an
article of commerce. All the silk which they purchased in the
different ports of India which they frequented, was brought
thither in ships of the country; and either from some defec of
(kill in minaging the lilk-worm, the produce of its ingenicus
indullry among the Chinese was scanty, or the intermediate
dealers found greater advantage in fuilrilhing the market of
Alexandria with a small quantity at an high price, than to
lower. its value by increaling the quantity. The other cir-
cumftance which I had in view, is more extraordinary, and
afftrds a firiking proof of the imperfec communication of
the ancients with remote nations, and of the slender knowledge
which they had of their natural produclions or arts. Much
as the manufadures of silk were admired, and often as silk is
mentioned by the Greek and Roman authors, they had not for
fivcral centuries after the uie of it became common, any cer-

tain

S E C T. tain knowledge either of the countries to which they were

iI. *, ^_ indebted for this favourite article of elegance, or of the man-

ner in which it was produced. By some, silk was supposed to
be a fine down adhering to the leaves of certain trees or
sowers; others imagined it to be a delicate species of wool or
cotton; and even those who had learned that it was the work
of an infe&, flew, by their descriptions, that they had no
diftinc idea of the manner in which it was formed '. It was
in consequence of an event that happened in the sixth century
of the Christian era, of which I (hall hereafter take notice,
that the real nature of silk became known in Europe.

THE other commodities usually imported from India, will

be mentioned in the account, which I now proceed to give, of
the cargoes sent out and brought home in the ships employed
in that trade. For this we are indebted to the circumnavi-
gation of the Erythrean sea, ascribed to Arrian, a curious
though short treatise, less known than it deserves to be,
and which enters into some details concerning commerce, to
which there is nothing similar in any ancient writer. The
first place in India, in which the ships from Egypt, while they
followed the ancient course of navigation, were accustomed
to trade, was Patala in the river Indus. They imported into
it woollen cloth of a flight fabric, linen in chequer work, some
precious stones, and fomr aromatics unknown in India, coral,
storax, glass veflels of different kinds, some wrought silver,
money, and wine. In return for thcfe, they received spices

of various kinds, sapphires, and other gems, silk ituffs, silk S E C T.
thread, cotton cloths', and black pepper. But a far more
considerable emporium on the fame coast was Barygaza, and
on that account the author, whom I follow here, describes its
situation, and the mode of approaching it, with great minute-
ness and accuracy. Its situation corresponds entirely with that
of Baroach, on the great river Nerbuddah, down the fiream of
which, or by land-carriage, from the great city of Tagara across
high mountains ", all the productions of the interior country
were conveyed to it. The articles of importation and export-
ation in this great mart were extensive and various. Besides
these already mentioned, our author enumerates among the
former, Italian, Greek, and Arabian wines, brass, tin, lead,
girdles or falhes of curious texture, melilot, white glass, red
arsenic, black lead, gold and fiver coin. Among the exports
he mentions the onyx, and other gems, ivory, myrrh, various
fabrics of cotton, both plain and ornamented with flowers, and
long pepper'. At Mufiris, the next emporium of note on
that coast, the articles imported were much the fame as at
Barygaza; but as it lay nearer to the eastern parts of India,
and seems to have had much communication with them, the
commodities exported from it were more numerous and more
valuable. He specifies particularly pearls in great abundance
and of extraordinary beauty, a variety of silk susss, rich per-
fumes, tortoifc-lhell, different kinds of transparent gems, efpe-
cially diamonds, and pepper in large quantities, and of the
best quality '.

THE

S E C T. THE justness of the account given by this author of the
a"__ '_ articles imported from India, is confirmed by a Roman law, in

which the Indian commodities fubje& to the payment of duties
are enumerated'. By comparing these two accounts, we may
form an idea, tolerably exact, of the nature and extent of the
trade with India in ancient times.

As the state of society and manners among the natives of

India, in the earliest period in which they are known, nearly
resembled what we observe among their descendants in the pre-
fcnt age; their wants and demands were, of course, much the
fame. The ingenuity of their own artists were so able to supply
thcfe, that they flood little in need of foreign manufacures or
productions, except some of the useful metals, which their
own country did not furnish in sufficient quantity; and then,
as now, it was moffly with gold and silver that the luxuries of
the East were purchased. In two particulars, however, our im-
portations from India differ greatly from those of the ancients.
The drels, both of the Greeks and Romans, was almost en-
tirely woollen, which, by their frequent use of the warm bath,
was rendered abundantly comfortable. Their consumption of
linen and cotton cloths was much inferior to that of modern
times, when these are worn by persons in every rank of life.
Accordingly, a great branch of modern importation from that
part of India with which the ancients were acquainted, is in
piccc-goids; comprehending, under that mercantile term, the
immcnfe variety of fabrics, which Indian ingenuity has formed
of cotton. But, as far as I have observed, we have no autho-

rity
58

rity that will justify us in fating the ancient importation of S E C T.
there to be in any degree considerable.

IN modern times, though it continues still to be chiefly a

commerce of luxury tuat is carried on with India, yet, to-
gether with the articles that minister to it, we import, to a
considerable extent, various commodities, which are to be con-
fidered merely as the materials of our domestic manufacures.
Such are the cotton-wool of Indoftan, the silk of China, and
the salt-petre of Bengal. But in the accounts of ancient im-
portations from India, raw silk and filk-thread excepted, I find
nothing mentioned that could serve as the materials of any
home-manufaaure. The navigation of the ancients never
having extended to China, the quantity of unwrought silk with
which they were supplied, by means of the Indian traders,
appears to have been so scanty, that the manufacture of it
could not make an addition of any moment to their domestic
industry.

AFTER this fuccinc account of the commerce carried on

by the ancients in India, I proceed to inquire what knowledge
they had of the countries beyond the ports of Mufiris and
Barace, the utmost boundary towards the East to which I have
hitherto traced their progress. The Author of the Circum-
navigation of the Erythrman Sea, whose accuracy of defcrip-
tion justifies the confidence with which I have followed him
for some time, seems to have been little acquainted with that
part of the coast which stretches from Barace towards the
south. He mentions, indeed, cursorily, two or three different

I 2 ports,

59

E C T. ports, but gives no intimation that any of them were staples
.-_-.. of the commerce with Egypt. He hastens to Comar or Cape

Comorin, the southernmost point of the Indian peninsula, and
his description of it is so accurate, and so conformable to its
real late, as (fews his information concerning it to have been
perfetly authentic '. Near to this he places the pearl-filhery
of Colchos, the modern Kilkare, undoubtedly the fame with
that now carried on by the Dutch in the lirait which separates
the island of Ceylon from the continent. As adjacent to this
he mentions three different ports, which appear to have been
situated on the east fide of the peninsula now known by the
name of the Coromandel coast. He describes these as emporia,
or stations of tradeb; but from an attentive consideration of
some circumstances in his account of them, I think it probable
that the ihips from Berenice did not fail to any of there
ports, though they were supplied, as he informs us, with
the commodities brought from Egypt, as well as with the
producions of the opposite coast of the peninsula; but these
crcm to have been imported in countryJflips'. It was like-
wrife in velfels of their own, varying in form and burden, and
diltinguithed by different names, some of which he mentions,
that they traded with the Golden Cherfonefus, or kingdom
of Malacca, and the countries near the Ganges. Not far
from the mouth of that river he places an inand, which he
defcribcs as situated under therifing fun, and as the last region
in the East that was inhabited . Of all these parts of India,

the Author of the Circumnavigation appears to have had very S E C T.
fender knowledge, as is manifest, not only from what he
mentions concerning this imaginary island, and from his not
attempting to describe them, but from his relating, with the
credulity and love of the marvellous, which always accompany
and charaCerife ignorance, that these remote regions were
peopled with cannibals, and men of uncouth and monfrous
forms .

' HAVE been induced to bestow this attention, in tracing

the course delineated in the Circumnavigation of the Erythraean
Sea, because the Author of it is the first ancient writer to
whom we are indebted for any knowledge of the eastern
coast of the great peninsula of India, or of the countries which
lie beyond it. To Strabo, who composed his great work on
geography in the reign of Augustus, India, particularly the
most eastern parts of it, was little known. He begins his
description of it with requesting the indulgence of his readers,
on account of the scanty information he could obtain with
refpec to a country so remote, which Europeans had seldom
visited, and many of them transiently only, in the funtions
of military service. He observes, that even commerce had con-
tributed little towards an accurate invcftigation of the country,
as few of the merchants from Egypt and the Arabian Gulf had
ever failed as far as the Ganges; and from men so illiterate,
intelligence that merited a full degree of confidence could
hardly be expected. His descriptions of India, particularly its

Peripl. p. 35.

interior

S E T. interior provinces, are borrowed almost entirely from the

M

_ emoirs of Alexander's Officers, with some slender additions

from more recent accounts, and these so few in number, and
sometimes so inaccurate, as to furnish a striking proof of the
finall progress which the ancients had made, from the time of
Alexander, in exploring that country. When an author, pof-
sessed of such discernment and industry as Strabo, who visited
iu person several distant regions that he might be able to
dcfcribe them with greater accuracy, relates, that the Ganges
enters the ocean by one mouth', we are warranted in conclud-
ing, that in his time there was either no dire& navigation
carried on to that great river, by the traders from the Arabian
Gulf, or that this voyage was undertaken so seldom, that science
had not then derived much information from it.

TIE next author, in order of time, fiam whom we receive

any account of India, is the elder Pliny, who flourished about
fifty years later than Strabo. As in the lhort description of
India given in his Natural History, he follows the fame guides
with Strabo, and seems to have had no knowledge of the
interior country, but what he derived from the officers who
served under Alexander and his immediate successors, it is
unnecef'ary to examine his description minutely. He has
added, however, two valuable articles, for which he was in-
debted to more recent discoveries. The one is the account of
the new course of navigation from the Arabian Gulf to the
coast of Malabar, the nature and importance of which I have

II.

Taprobana, which I shall confider particularly, after enquir- .
ing into what Ptolemy has contributed towards our knowledge
of the ancient state of India.

TIIOUG Ptolemy, who published his works about fourscore

years after Pliny, seems to have been more difinguilied for his
persevering industry, and talent for arrangement, than for an
inventive genius; geography has been more indebted to him
for its improvement, than to any other philosopher. For-
tunately for that science, in forming his general fyletm of
geography, he adopted the ideas, and imitated the practice of
Hipparchus, who lived near four hundred years before his
time. That great philosopher was the first who attempted to
make a catalogue of the stars. In order to ascertain their
position in the heavens with accuracy, he measurcd their dif-
tance from certain circles of the fpherc, computing it by
degrees, either from east to weft, or from north to south. The
former was denominated the longitude of the star, the latter
its latitude. This mode he found to be of such utility in his
astronomical researches, that he applied it with no less happy
effec to geography; and it is a circumstance worthy of
notice, that it was by observing and dcfcribing the heavens,
men were first taught to measure and delineate the earth
with exactncfs. This method of fixing the position of places,
invented by Hipparchus, though known to the geographers
between his time and that of Ptolemy, and mentioned both
by Strabo , and by Pliny", was not employcd by any of

them.

S E C T. them. Of this neglec the most probable account seems to be,

I'.

that, as none of them were aitronomers, they did not fully
comprehend all the advantages geography might derive from
this invention'. These Ptolemy, who had devoted a long life
to the improvement of aitronomy, theoretical as well as prati-
cal, perfectly discerned, and, as in both there Hipparchus was
his guide, he, in his famous treatise on geography, described
the different parts of the earth.according to their longitude
and latitude. Geography was thus established upon its proper
principles, and intimately conneced with astronomical obferva-
tion and mathematical fdence. This work of Ptolemy soon
rose high in estimation among the ancients'. During the
middle ages, both in Arabia and in Europe, the decisions of
Ptolemy, in every thing relative to geography, were submitted
to with an assent as implicit, as was yielded to those of
Aristotle in all other departments of science. On the revival
of a more liberal spirit of inquiry in the sixteenth century, the
merit of Ptolemy's improvements in geography was examined
and recognized; that scientific language which he first rendered
general, continues to be used, and the position of places is still
ascertained in the fame diftina and compendious manner, by
specifying their longitude and latitude.

NOT satisfied with adopting the general principles of Hippar-

chus, Ptolemy emulated him in the application of them; and,
as that philosopher had arranged all the conltellations, he ven-
tured upon what was no less arduous, to survey all the regions

*I

of
II

of the earth, which were then known, and with minute and S E C T.
bold decision he fixed the longitude and latitude of the most _
remarkable places in each of them. All his determinations,
however, are not to be confidered as the result of aaual ob-
servation, nor did Ptolemy publilh them as such. Aftrono-
mical fience was confined, at that time, to a few countries.
A considerable part of the globe was little visited, and imper-
fectly described. The position of a small number of places
only had been fixed with any degree of accuracy. Ptolemy
was therefore obliged to consult the itineraries and surveys of
the Roman Empire, which the political wisdom of that great
Ilate had completed with immehfe labour and expence'.
Beyond the precincs of the empire, he had nothing on which
he could rely, but the journals and reports of travellers.
Upon these all his conclusions were founded; and as he resided
in Alexandria at a time when the trade from that city to India
was carried on to its utmost extent, this situation might have
been expeced to afford him the means of procuring ample in-
formation concerning it. But either from the imperfeCt man-
rin which that country was explored in his time, or from
his placing too much confidence in the reports of persons
wvho had visited it with little attention or discernment m, his
general delineation of the form of the Indian continent is
the mos erroneous that has been transmitted to us from
antiquity. By an astonishing mistake, he has made the penin-
fula of India firetch from the Sinus Barygazenus, or Gulf of
Cambay, from weft to east, inflead of extending, according to

obje& of this Disquisition, to enter into such a minute detail;
but in several instances we may observe, that not only the
conformity of position, but the similarity of ancient and
modern names, is very striking. The great river Cauveri is by
Ptolemy named Chaberis; Arcot, in the interior country, is
Arcati Regia; and probably the whole coast has received its
present name of Coromandel from Sor Mandulia, or the king-
dom of Sore, which is situated upon it P.

IN the course of one hundred and thirty-fix years, which

clapsed from the death of Straho to that of Ptolemy, the com-
mercial intercourse with India was greatly extended; the latter
geographer had acquired such an accession of new information
concerning the Ganges, that he mentions the names of fix
different mouths of that river, and describes their positions.
His delineation, however, of that part of India which lies
beyond the Ganges, is not less erroneous in its general form,
than that which he gave of the peninsula, and bears as little
resemblance to the aaual position of those countries. He
ventures, neverthelcfs, upon a survey of them, similar to that
which he had made of the other great division of India, which
I have already examined. He mentions the places of note
along the coast, some of which he diftinguilhes as Emporia;
but whether that name was given to them on account of their
being staples of trade to the natives, in their traffic carried on
from one diltriEt of India to another, or whether they were

which Ptolemy meanis to convey; but these regions of India
were so remote, and, from the timid and low course of
ancient navigation, were probably so little frequented, that his
information concerning them is extremely defective, and his
dcfcriptions more obscure, more inaccurate, and less conform-
able to the real state of the country, than in any part of his
geography. That pcninfula to which he gives the name of
the Golden Cherfonefus, he delineates as if it itretched directly
from north to south, and fixes the latitude of Sabana Empo-
rium, its southern extremity, three degrees beyond the line.
To the east of this peninsula he places, what he calls the Great
Bay, and in the most remote part of it the fiation of Catigara,
the utmost boundary of navigation in ancient times, to which
he assigns no less than eight degrees and a half of southern
hltitude. Beyond this, he declares the earth to be altogether
unknown, and afterts that the land turns thence to the weft-
ward, and stretches in that direcion until it joins the pro-
montory of Praffum in Ethiopia, which, according to his idea,
terminated the continent of Africa to the south q. In confe-
quence of this error, no less unaccountable than enormous, he
rust have believed the Erythrnan Sea, in its whole extent
from the coast of Africa to that of Cambodia, to be a vafL
baron, without any communication with the ocean'.

OUT
68

OUT of the confusion of those wild ideas, in which the ac- S E C T.

counts of ignorant or fabulous travellers have involved the geo-
graphy of Ptolemy, M. D'Anville has attempted to bring order;
and, with much ingenuity, he has formed opinions with refpe&
to some capital positions, which have the appearance of being
well founded. The peninsula of Malacca is, according to him,
the Golden Cherfonefus of Ptolemy; but instead of the direc-
tion which he has given it, we know that it bends some
degrees towards the east, and that Cape de Romania, its
southern extremity, is more than a degree to the north of the
line. The Gulf of Siam he confiders as the Great Bay of
Ptolemy, but the position on the eat fide of that Bay, cor-
responding to Catigara, is acually as many degrees to the
north of the Equator, as he supposed it to be south of it.
Beyond this he mentions an inland city, to which he gives the
name of Thinae or Sinae Metropolis. The longitude which he
aflligns to it, is one hundred and eighty degrees from his firfi
meridian in the Fortunate Island, and is the utmost point towards
the Eat to which the ancients had advanced by sea. Its latitude
he calculates to be three degrees south of the line. If, with M.
D'Anville, we conclude the situation of Sin-hoa, in the western
part of the kingdom of Cochin-China, to be the fame with
Sinx Metropolis, Ptolemy has erred in fixing its position no
less than fifty degrees of longitude, and twenty degrees of
latitude '.

S E C T. THESE errors of Ptolemy concerning the remote parts

of Asia, hive been rendered more conspicuous by a mistaken
opinion of modem times ingrafted upon them. Sine, the most
dillant station mentioned in his geography, has such a near
resemblance in found to China, the name by which the greatest
and molf civilized empire in the Ealt is known to Europeans,
that upon their first acquaintance with it, they hastily concluded
them to be the fame; and of consequence it was supposed that
China was known to the ancients, though no point seems to be
more afertained, than that they never advanced by sea beyond
that boundary which I have allotted to their navigation.

HAVING thus traced the discoveries of India which the

ancients made by sea, I fiall next examine what additional
knowledge of that country they acquired from their progress by
land. It appears (as I have formerly related) that there was a
trade carried on early with India through the provinces that
firetch along its northern frontier. Its various productions and
manufatures were transported by land-carriage into the interior
parts of the Persian dominions, or were conveyed, by means of
the navigable rivers which flow through the Upper Asia, to the
Caspian Sea and from that to the Euxine. While the ficcerlbrs
of Seleucus retained the dominion of the East, this continued
to be the mode of supplying their fubjeds with the commo-
dities of India. When the Romans had extended their conquests
so far that the Euphrates was the Eastern limit of their empire,
they found this trade fill established, and as it opened to them
a new communication with the East, by means of which they
received an additional supply of luxuries, for which they

policy to protec& and encourage it. As the progress of the cart-
vans or companies of merchants, which travelled towards the
countries whence they received the mos valuable manufadures,
particularly those of silk, was often interrupted, and' rendered
dangerous by the Parthians, who had acquired possession of all
the provinces which extend from the Caspian Sea to that part
of Scythia or Tartary which borders on China, the Romans
endeavoured to render this intercourse more secure by a nego-
ciation with one of the monarchs of that great empire. Of
this lingular tranfsaion there is, indeed, no vestige in the Greek
or Roman writers; our knowledge of it is derived entirely from
the Chinese historians, by whom we are informed that
An-toun, (the Emperor Marcus Antoninus,) the king of the
peoplefe Western Ocean, sent an embassy with this view to
Oun-ti, who reigned over China in the hundred and fixty-fixth
year of the Christian ara'. What was the success of this
attempt is not known, nor can we fay whether it facilitated
inich an intercourle between these two remote nations as con-
tributed towards the supply of their mutual wants. The design
certainly was not unworthy of the enlightened emperor of
Rome to whom it is ascribed.

IT is evident, however, that in prosecuting this trade with

China, a confidcrable part of the extensive countries to the
east of the Caspian Sea must have been traverscd; and though

IL

gain, yet, in the course of ages, there must have mingled
among the adventurers, persons of curiosity and abilities, who
could turn their attention from commercial objects to those of
more general concern. From them such information was pro-
cured, and fubjeaed to scientific discussion, as enabled Ptolemy
to give a description of those inland and remote regions of
Asia , fully as accurate as that of several countries, of which,
from their vicinity, he may have been supposed to have re-
ceived more diftinC accounts. The farthest point towards the
East, to which his knowledge of this part of Asia extended, is
Sera Metropolis, which, from various circumflances, appears
to have been in the fame situation with Kant-cheou, a city of
some note in Chen-fi, the most westerly province of the
Chinese empire. This he places in the longitude of one
hundred and feventy-feven degrees fifteen minutes, near three
degrees to the weft of Sine Metropolis, which he had defcrib-
ed as the utmost limit of Asia discovered by sea. Nor was
Ptolemy's knowledge of this diftria of Asia confined only to
that part of it through which the caravans may be supposed
to have proceeded direcly in their route eastward; he had
received likewise some general information concerning various
nations towards the north, which, according to the position
that he gives them, occupied parts of the great plain of Tartary,
extending considerably beyond Lafia, the capital of Thibet, and
the residence of the Dalai Lama.

THE latitudes of several places in this part of Asia are fixed S E C T.

by Ptolemy with such uncommon precision, that we can hardly
doubt of their having been ascertained by actual observation.
Out of many instances of this, I shall felec three of places
situated in very different parts of the country under review.
The latitude of Nagara, on the river Cophenes, (the modern
Attock,) is, according to Ptolemy, thirty-two degrees and thirty
minutes, which co-incides precisely with the observation of an
Eastern geographer quoted by M. D'Anville '. The latitude
of Maracanda, or Samarcand, as fixed by him, is thirty-nine
degrees fifteen minutes. According to the AfRronomical Tables
of Ulug Beg, the grandson of Timur, whose royal residence
was in that city, it is thirty-nine degrees thirty-feven minutes'.
The latitude of Sera Metropolis, in Ptolemy, is thirty-eight
degrees fifteen minutes; that of Kant-cheou, as determined
by the Jesuit Miflionaries, is thirty-nine degrees. I have
enumerated these striking examples of the co-incidence of his
calculations with those established by modern observations, for
two reasons: One, because they clearly prove that these re-
mote parts of Asia had been examined with some considerable
degree of attention; the other, because I feel great fatisfaaion,
after having been obliged to mention several errors and defects
in Ptolemy's geography, in rendering jufice to a philosopher,
who has contributed so much towards the improvement of that
science. The sacs which I have produced afford the strongest
evidence of the extent of his information, as well as the

HITIIERTO 1 have confined my researches concerning the

Lkowledge which the ancients had of India, to the continent;
1 return now to confider the discoveries which they had made,
of the islands situated in various parts of the ocean with which
it is surrounded, and begin, as I proposed, with Taprobane,
the greatest and mos valuable of them. This illand lay so
direftly in the course of navigators who ventured beyond
Cape Comorin, especially when, according to the ancient mode
of failing, they seldom ventured far from the coast, that its
position, one ihould have thought, must have been determined
with the utmost precision. There is, however, hardly any
point in the geography of the ancients more undecided and
uncertain. Prior to the age of Alexander the Great, the name
of Taprobane was unknown in Europe. In consequence of
the active curiosity with which he explored every country that
lie subdued or visited, some information concerning it seems to
have been obtained. From his time, almost every writer on
geography has mentioned it, but their accounts of it are so
various, and often so contradicory, that we can hardly believe
them to be describing the fame island. Strabo, the earliest writer
now extant, from whom we have any particular account of
it, affirms that it was as large as Britain, and situated at
the distance of seven days, according to some reports, and
according to other, of twenty days failing from the southern
extremity of the Indian peninsula; from which, contrary to

what
74

75
what is known to be its real position, he describes it as stretch- S E C T.

I.

ing towards the weft above five hundred stadia '. Pomponius _
Mela, the author next in order of time, is uncertain whether
he should confider Taprobane as an island, or as the beginning
of another world; but as no person, he fays, had ever failed
round it, he seems to incline towards the latter opinion'.
Pliny gives a more ample description of Taprobane, which,
instead of bringing any acceflion of light, involves every thing
relating to it in additional obscurity. After enumerating the
various and discordant opinions of the Greek writers, he in-
forms us, that ambassadors were lent by a king of that ifand to
the emperor Claudius, from whom the Romans learned several
things concerning it, which were formerly unknown; particu-
larly that there were five hundred towns in the island, and
that in the centre of it there was a lake three hundred and
feventy-five miles in circumference. These ambassadors were
aftoniihed at the fight of the Great Bear, and the Pleiades, being
confiellations which did not appear in their iky; and were fill
more amazed when they beheld their ihadows point towards
the north, and the fun rife on their left hand, and set on their
right. They affirmed too, that in their country the moon
was never seen until the eighth day after the change, and con.
tinued to be visible only to the sixteenth b. It is surprising to
find an author so intelligent as Pliny relating all these circum-
stances without animadversion, and particularly that he does

the appearance of the moon, could not take place in any
region of the earth.

PTOLEMY, though so near to the age of Pliny, seems to have

been altogether unacquainted with his description of Taprobane,
or with the embarfy to the emperor Claudius. He places that
ifand opposite to Cape Comorin, at no great distance from
the continent, and delineates it as stretching from north to
south no less than fifteen degrees, two of which he supposes
to be south of the Equator; and if his representation of its
dimensions had been just, it was well intitled from its magni-
tude to be compared with Britain'. Agathemerus, who wrote
after Ptolemy, and was well acquainted with his geography,
confiders Taprobane as the largest of all ifiands, and afligns to
Britain only the second place'.

FROM this diverity of the descriptions given by ancient wri-

ters, it is not surprising that the moderns ihould have enter-
tained very different sentiments with refped to the island in the
Indian ocean which was to be confidered as the fame with the
Taprobane of the Greeks and Romans. As both Pliny and
Ptolemy describe it as lying in part to the south of the Equator,
some learned men maintain Sumatra to be the island which cor-
responds to this description. But the great distance of Sumatra
from the peninsula of India does not accord with any account

which

which the Greek or Roman writers have given of the situation of S E C T.
Taprobane, and we have no evidence that the navigation of the .
ancients ever extended so far as Sumatra. The opinion. more
generally received is,' that the Taprobane of the ancients is.
the ifand of Ceylon; and not only its vicinity to the continent
of India, but the general. form of the island, as delineated by
Ptolemy, as well as the position of several places in it, men--
tioned by him, establish this opinion (notwithstanding some
extraordinary mistakes, of which I lhall afterwards take notice)
with a great degree of certainty.

TaE other illands to the east of Taprobane, mentioned by

Ptolemy, might be ihewn (if such a detail were necessary)
to be the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Gulf of
Bengal..

AFTER this long, and, I am afraid, tedious invefligation of

the progress made by the ancients, in exploring the different
parts of India, and after tracing them as far as they advanced
towards the East, either by sea or land, I ihall offer some
general remarks concerning the mode in which their discoveries
were conducted, and the degree of confidence with which we
may rely on the accounts of them, which could not have been
offered with the fame advantage until this invetigation was-
finilhed.

THE art of delineating maps, exhibiting either the figure of

the whole earth, as far as it had been explored, or that of
particular countries, was known to the ancients; and without

the

77

S E C T. the use of them to afift the imagination, it was impoflfble to

have formed a diftinc idea either of the one or of the other.
Some of these maps are mentioned by Herodotus, and other
early Greek writers. But no maps prior to those which were
formed in order to illustrate the geography of Ptolemy, have
reached our times, in consequence of which it is very difficult
to conceive what was the relative situation of the different
places mentioned by the ancient geographers, unless when it
is precisely ascertained by measurement'. As soon, however,
as the mode of marking the situation of each place by specify.
ing its longitude and latitude was introduced, and came to be
generally adopted, every poftion could be described in com-
pendious and scientific terms. But still the accuracy of this
new method, and the improvement which geography derived
from it, depends upon the mode in which the ancients eflimated
the latitude and longitude of places.

TuOUGH the ancients proceeded in determining the latitude

and longitude of places upon the fame principles with the
moderns, yet it was by means of inflrumentsvery inferior in their
conftrution to those now used, and without the fame minute
attention to every circumtfance that may asset the accuracy of
an observation, an attention of which long experience only
can demonstrate the necessity. In order to ascertain the latitude
of any place, the ancients observed the meridian altitude of
the fun, either by means of the Ihadow of a perpendicular
gnomon, or by means of an astrolabe, from which it was

Se NOTE XXXIII.

easy
78

easy to compute how many degrees and minutes the place of S E C T.
observation was distant from the Equator. When neither of ,
there methods could be employed, they inferred the latitude of
any place from the best accounts which they could procure of
the length of its longed day.

WITH refpec to determining the longitude of any place,

they were much more at a loss, as there was only one set of
celestial phenomena to which they could have recourse. These
were the eclipses of the moon (for those of the fun were not
so well understood as to be subservient to the purposes of
geography): the difference between the time at which an eclipse
was observed to begin or to end at two different places, gave
immediately the difference between the meridians of those
places. But the difficulty of making those observations with
accuracy, and the impossibility of repeating them often, ren-
dered them of so little use in geography, that the ancients in
determining longitudes were obliged, for the most part, to
have recourse to a&ual surveys, or to the vague information
which was to be obtained from the reckonings of tailors, or the
itineraries of travellers

BUT though the ancients, by means of the operations

which I have mentioned, could determine the position of
places with a considerable degree of accuracy at land, it is
very uncertain whether or not they had any proper mode of
determining this at sea. The navigators of antiquity seem rarely
to have had recourse to agronomical observation. They had
no instruments suitcd to a moveable and unfleady observatory;

o1 and

79

S E C T. and though by their praaice of landing frequently, they might,
* -^'-j in some measure, have supplied that defet, yet no ancient

author, as far as I know, has given an account of any aftro-
nomical observation made by them during the course of their
voyages. It seems to be evident from Ptolemy, who employs
some chapters in fiewing how geography may be improved,
and its errors may be rectified, from the reports of navigators ,
that all their calculations were founded solely upon reckoning,
and were not the result of observation. Even after all the im-
provements which the moders have made in the science of
navigation, this mode of computing by reckoning is known
to be so loose and uncertain, that, from it alone, no conclusion
can be deduced with any great degree of precision. Among
the ancients, this inaccuracy must have been greatly augmented,
as they were accustomed in their voyages, instead of fleering a
dire& course which might have been more easily measured,
to a circuitous navigation along the coast; and were unac-
quainted with the compass, or any other instrument by which
its bearings might have been ascertained. We find, accordingly,
the position of many places which we may suppose to have
been determined at sea, fixed with little exacnefs. When, in
consequence of an ative trade, the ports of any country
were much frequented, the reckonings of different navigators
may have servcd in some measure to correct each other,
and may have enabled geographers to form their conclusions
with a nearer approximation to truth. But in remote coun-
tries, which have neither been the feat of military operations,

nor explored by caravans travelling frequently through them, S E C T.
every thing is more vague and undefined, and the resemblance . ,
between the ancient descriptions of them, and their actual
figure, is often so faint that it can hardly be traced. The
latitude of places too, as might be expeced, was in general much
more accurately known by the ancients than their longitude.
The observations by which the former was determined are
simple, made with ease, and are not liable to much error.
The other cannot be ascertained precisely, without more com-
plex operations, and the use of instruments much more perfec
than any that the ancients seem to have possessed . Among
the vast number of places, the position of which is fixed by
Ptolemy, I know not if he approaches as near to truth in
the longitude of any one, as he has done in fixing the lati-
tude of the three cities which I formerly mentioned as a ftrik-
ing, though not singular, instance of his exaanefs.

THESE observations induce me to adhere to an opinion,

which I proposed in another place h, that the Greeks and
Romans, in their commercial intercourse with India, were
seldom led, either by curiosity or the love of gain, to visit the
more eastern parts of it. A variety of particulars occur to
'confirm this opinion. Though Ptolemy bestows the appellation
of Emporia on several places situated on the coast, which
stretches from the eastern mouth of the Ganges to the ex-
tremity of the Golden Cherfonefus, it is uncertain, as I for-
merly observed, whether from his having given them this
name, we are to confider them as harbours frequented by ships
from Egypt, or merely by vessels of the country. Beyond the
* See NOTE XXXIV. ' llif. of America, vol. i. p. 80. 315.

M Golden

Or

S E C T. Golden Cherfonefus, it is remarkable that he mentions one

. Emporium only', which plainly indicates the intercourse with

this region of India to have been very inconsiderable. Had
voyages from the Arabian Gulf to those countries of India
been as frequent, as to have intitled Ptolemy to specify so
minutely the longitude and latitude of the great number of
places which he mentions, he must, in consequence of this,
have acquired such information as.would have prevented several
great errors into which he has fallen. Had it been usual to
double Cape Comorin, and to fail up the Bay of Bengal to the
mouth of the Ganges, some of the ancient geographers would
not have been so uncertain, and others so widely mistaken,
with refpet to the situation and magnitude of the island of
Ceylon. If the merchants of Alexandria had often visited
the ports of the Golden Cherfonefus, and of the Great Bay,
Ptolemy's descriptions of them mufl have been rendered more
correspondent to their real form, nor could he have believed
leveral places to lie beyond the line, which are in truth some
degrees on this lide of it.

BUT though the navigation of the ancients may not have

extended to the farther India, we are certain that various
commodities of that country were imported into Egypt, and
thence were conveyed to Rome, and to other parts of the
empire. From circumstances which I have already enumerat-
eJ, we are warranted in concluding, that there were brought
in vefiels of the country to Mufiris, and to the other ports on

' Li. nii. c. 2.

the
82

the Malabar coast, which were, at that period, the fiaples of S E C T.
trade with Egypt. In a country of such extent as India, I_
where the natural productions are various, and greatly diver-
fified by art and industry, an aCive domestic commerce, both
by sea and by land, must have early taken place among its
different provinces. Of this we have some hints in ancient
authors; and where the sources of information are so few and
so scanty, we must reft satisfied with hints. Among the
different classes, or casts, into which the people of India were
divided, merchants are mentioned as one', from which we
may conclude trade to have been one of the established occu-
pations of men in that country. From the Author of the
Circumnavigation of the Erythrean Sea, we learn that the
inhabitants of the Coromandel coast traded in vessels of their
own with those of Malabar; that the interior trade of Barygaza
was considerable; and that there was, at all seasons, a number
of country ihips to be found in the harbour of Mufiris'. By
Strabo we are informed, that the mos valuable producions of
Taprobane were carried to different Enporia of India m. In
this way the traders from Egypt might be supplied with them,
and thus could finiih their voyages within the year, which
must have been protraced much longer if they had extended
as far towards the east as is generally supposed.

FROM all this it appears to be probable, that Ptolemy
derived the information concerning the eastern parts of India,

. direct and regular intercourse between Egypt and there coun-

tries, as from the reports of a few adventurers, whom an
cnterprifing spirit, or the love of gain, prompted to proceed
beyond the usual limits of navigation.

Tiioucl, from the age of Ptolemy, the trade with India

continued to be carried on in its former channel, and both
Rome, the ancient capital of the empire, and Constantinople,
the new feat of government, were supplied with the precious
commodities of that country by the merchants of Alexandria,
yet, until the reign of tie emperor Juflinian, we have no
new information concerning the intercourse with the East by
fca, or the progress which was made in the discovery of its
remote regions. Under Justinian, Cofmas, an Egyptian
merchant, in the course of his traffic, made some voyages
to India, whence he acquired the firname of Indicopleuftes;
but afterwards, by a transition not uncommon in that super-
flitious age, he renounced all the concerns of this life, and
assumed the monastic character. In the solitude and leisure of
a cell, he composed several works, one of which, dignified by
him with the name of CbrifJian Topography, has reached us.
The main design of it is to combat the opinion of those phi-
lofophers, who assert the earth to be of a spherical figure, and
to prove that it is an oblong plane, of twelve thousand miles in
length from east to wet, and of fix thousand miles in breadth
from north to south, surrounded by high walls, covered by
the firmament as with a canopy or vault; that the vicissitude
S4

of
11

of day and night was occasioned by a mountain of prodigious S E C T.
height, situated in the extremities of the north, round which I
the fun moved; that when it appeared on one fide of this
mountain, the earth was illuminated, when concealed on the
other fide, the earth was left involved in darkness ". But amidf
those wild reveries, more suited to the credulity of his new
profefflon, than to the found sense charaderiftie of that in
which he was formerly engaged, Cofmas seems to relate what
he himself had observed in his travels, or what he had learned
from others, with great simplicity and regard for truth.

HE appears to have been well acquainted with the wefE

coast of the Indian peninsula, and names several places situated
upon it; he describes it as the chief feat of the pepper trade,
and mentions Male, in particular, as one of the most fre-
quented ports on that account °. From Male, it is probable
that this fide of the continent has derived its modern name
of Malabar; and the cluster of ifiands contiguous to it, that of
the Maldives. From him too we learn, that the island of
Taprobane, which he supposes to lie at an equal distance
from the Persian Gulf on the weft, and the country of the
Sinxe on the east, had become, in consequence of this com-
modious situation, a great flaple of trade; that into it were
imported the silk of the Sine, and the precious spices of the
Eastern countries, which were conveyed thence to all parts of
India, to Pcrfia, and to the Arabian Gulf. To this illand he

gives

S E C T. gives the name of Sielediba , the fame with that of Selendib,

or Serendib, by which it is still known all over the East.

To Cofmas we are also indebted for the first information

of a new rival to the Romans in trade having appeared in the
Indian seas. The Persians, after having overturned the empire
of the Parthians, and re-established the line of their ancient
monarchs, seem to have surmounted entirely the aversion of
their ancestors to maritime exertion, and made early and
vigorous efforts in order to acquire a ihare in the lucrative
commerce with India. All its confiderablc ports were fre-
quented by traders from Persia, who, in return for some pro-
duaions of their own country in request among the Indians,
received the precious commodities, which they conveyed up
the Persian Gulf, and by means of the great rivers, Euphrates
and Tigris, distributed them through every province of their
empire. As the voyage from Persia to India was much shorter
than that from Egypt, and attended with less expence and
danger, the intercourse between the two countries increased
rapidly. A circumstance is mentioned by Cofmas which is a
striking proof of this. In most of the cities of any note in
India he found Christian churches eftabliihed, in which the
funcions of religion were performed by prielts ordained by the
archbishop of Seleucia, the capital of the Persian empire, and
who continued subjea to his jurifdidion'. India appears
to have been more thoroughly explored at this period, than it
was in the age of Ptolemy, and a greater number of strangers

that, according to the account of Cofmas, none of these firan- ,-
gers were accustomed to visit the eatern regions of Asia, but
refted satisfied with receiving their silk, their spices, and other
valuable productions, as they were imported into Ceylon, and
conveyed thence to the various marts of India '.

THE frequency of open hostilities between the emperors of

Constantinople and the monarchs of Persia, together with the
increasing rivalfluip of their fubjets in the trade with India,
gave rife to an event which produced a considerable change
in the nature of that commerce. As the use of silk, both in
dress and furniture, became gradually more general in the
court of the Greek emperors, who imitated and furpafled the
sovereigns of Asia in splendour and magnificence; and as
China, in which, according to the concurring teflimony of
Oriental writers, the culture of silk was originally known',
fill continued to be the only country which produced that
valuable commodity; the Persians, improving the advantages
which their situation gave them over the merchants from the
Arabian Gulf, supplanted them in all the marts of India to
which silk was brought by sea from the EaR. Having it like-
wife in their power to molest or to cut off the caravans, which, in
order to procure a supply for the Greek empire, travelled by land'
to China, through the northern provinces of the kingdom, they
entirely engrosscd that branch of commerce. Conflantinople was
obliged to depend on a rival power for an article which luxury

t' rT. viewed and desired as essential to elegance. The Perfianw,
;..--- wmith the usual rapacity of monopolists, raised the price of silk

to fj:h an exorbitant height', that Juflinian, eager not only
to obtain a full and certain supply of a commodity which was
become of indispensable use, but solicitous to deliver the com-
merce of his fubjecs from the exactions of his enemies, en-
dcivoured, by means of his ally, the Chritlian monarch of
Abyssinia, to wrest some portion of the silk trade from the
Perilans. In this attempt he failed; but when he least
..D. 55j. expeced it, he, by an unforeseen event, attained, in some

mealure, the objeCt which he had in view. Two Persian
monks having been employed as missionaries in some of the
Christian churches, which were eflablilhed (as we are inform-
ed by Cofmas) in different parts of India, had penetrated into
the country of the Seres, or China. There they observed the
labours of the silk-worm, and became acquainted with all the arts
of man in working up its productions into such a variety of
elegant fabrics. The profped of gain, or perhaps an indignant
zeal, excited by feeing this lucrative branch of commerce en-
grossed by unbelieving nations, prompted them to repair to Con-
fiantinople. There they explained to the emperor the origin
of silk, as well as the various modes of preparing and manu-
facturing it, myfleries hitherto unknown, or very imperfeAtly
understood in Europe; and encouraged by his liberal promises,
they undertook to bring to the capital a fuflicient number of
those wonderful infects, to whose labours man is so much in-
debted. This they accomplifed by conveying the eggs of the

heat of a dunghill, fed with the leaves of a wild mulberry
tree, and they multiplied and worked in the fame manner as in
those climates where they first became objects of human atten-
tion and care ". Vast numbers of these infcts were soon rear-
ed in different parts of Greece, particularly in the Peloponefus.
Sicily afterwards undertook to breed silk-worms with equal
success, and was imitated, from time to time, in fevcral towns of
Italy. In all these places extensive manufaturcs were eflablifhed,
and carried on, with silk of dometic production. The demand
for silk from the East diminifled of course, the fubjeas of the
Greek emperors were no longer obliged to have recourse to
the Persians for a filpply of it, and a considerable change took
place in the nature of the commercial intercourse between
Europe and India x.

,_-.- the Arabs, satisfied from the earliest times with national inde-

pendence and personal liberty, tended their camels, or reared
their palm-trees, within the precincs of their own peninsula,
and had little intercourse with the reft of mankind, unless
when they sallied out to plunder a caravan, or to rob a traveller.
In some diftrias, however, they had begun to add the labours
of agriculture, and the business of commerce, to the occupa-
tions of pastoral life. All these orders of men, when prompt-
ed by the enthufiaflic ardour with which the exhortations and
example of Mahomet inspired them, displayed, at once, all
the zeal of miflonaries, and the ambition of conquerors.
They spread the doctrine of their prophet, and extended the
dominion of his successors, from the ihores of the Atlantic to
the frontier of China, with a rapidity of success to which
A.D. 640. there is nothing similar in the history of mankind. Egypt

was one of their earliest conquefis; and as they fettled in that
inviting country, and kept poffeflion of it, the Greeks were-
excluded from all intercourse with Alexandria, to which they
had long resorted as the chief mart of Indian goods. Nor
was this the only effe& which the progress of the Maho-
medan arms had upon the commerce of Europe with India.
Frior to their invasion of Egypt, the Arabians had subdued the
great kingdom of Persia, and added it to the empire of their
Caliphs. They found their new fubjets engaged in prosecuting
that extensive trade with India, and the country to the east of
it, the commencement and progress of which in Persia I have
already mentioned; and they were so sensible of the great ad-
vantages derived from it, that they became desirous to partake
91

of

of them. As the active powers of the human mind, when S E C T.

Ill.

roused to vigorous exertions in one line, are most capable of -
operating with force in other directions; the Arabians, from
impetuous warriors, soon became enterprising merchants.
They continued to carry on the trade with India in its former
channel from the Persian Gulf, but it was with that ardour
which characterizes all the early efforts of Mahomet's follow.
ers. In a lhort time they advanced far beyond the boundaries
of ancient navigation, and brought many of the mole precious
commodities of the East directly from the countries which
produced them. In order to engross all the profit arising from
the sale of them, the Caliph Omar , a few years after the
conquest of Persia, founded the city of Baffora, on the weftem
banks of the great stream formed by the juncion of the
Euphrates and Tigris, with a view of securing the command
of these two rivers, by which goods imported from India were
conveyed into all parts of Asia. With such discernment was
the situation chosen, that Baffora loon became a place of trade
hardly inferior to Alexandria.

THIS general information with refpec to the trade of the

Arabians with India, which is all that can be derived from
the historians of that period, is confirmed and illustrated by
the Relation of a Voyage from the Persian Gulf towards the
EaR, written by an Arabian merchant in the year of the
Christian era eight hundred and fifty-one, about two centuries

__ . Commentary of another Arabian, who had likewise visited the

Eastern parts of Asia b. This curious Relation, which enables
us to fill up a chasm in the hiRory of mercantile communica-
tion with India, furnifles materials for describing more in
detail the extent of the Arabian discoveries in the East, and
the manner in which they made them.

THOUGH some have imagined that the wonderful property

of the magnet, by which it communicates such virtue to a
needle or lender rod of iron, as to make it point towards the
poles of die earth, was known in the East long before it was
observed in Europe, it is manifest, both from the Relation of
the Mahometan merchant, and from much concurring evi-
dence, that not only the Arabians, but the Chinese, were
deltitute of this faithful guide, and that their mode of navi-
gation was not more adrentrous than that of the Greeks and
Romans'. They fleered servilely along the coast, seldom
flretching out to sea so far as to lose fight of land, and as
they iRaped their courfc in this timid manner, their mode
of reckoning was defecivc, and liable to the fame errors which
1 obli-rcd in that of the Greeks and Romans .

NOTWITHSTANDING these diladvantages, the progress of

the Arabians towards the East extended far beyond the Gulf

IlL.

acquainted with Sumatra, and the other islands of the great ,
Indian Archipelago, and advanced as far as the city of Canton
in China. Nor are these discoveries to be confidered as the
effet of the enterprising curiosity of individuals; they were-
owing to a regular commerce carried on from the Persian
Gulf with China, and all the intermediate countries. Many
Mahomedans, imitating the example of the Perfans described
by Cofmas Indicopleuftes, fettled in India and the countries
beyond it. They were so numerous in the city of Canton,
that the emperor (as the Arabian authors relate) permitted
them to have a Cadi or judge of their own fed, who decided
controversies among his countrymen by their own laws, and
presided in all the funcions of religion'. In other places
proselytes were gained to the Mahomedan faith, and the
Arabian language was understood and spoken in alnmot every
sea-port of any note. Ships from China and different places of
India traded in the Persian Gulf', and by the frequency of
mutual intercourse, all the nations of the EaR became better
acquainted with each other.'.

A STRIKING proof of this is the new information concern-

ing China and India we receive from the two authors I have
mentioned. They point out the situation of Canton,. now so
well known to Europeans, with a considerable degree of exact-
ness.. They take notice of the general use of silk among the

S E C T. Chinese. They are the first who mention their celebrated

. manufacture of porcelane, which, on account of its delicacy

and transparency, they compare to glass. They describe the
tea-tree, and the mode of using its leaves; and from the great
revenue which was levied (as they inform us) from the con-
fumption of it, tea seems to have been as universally the favour-
ite beverage of the Chinese in the ninth century, as it is at
present '.

EVEN with refpea to those parts of India which the Greeks

and Romans were accustomed to visit, the Arabians had ac-
quired more perfec information. They mention a great em-
pire established on the Malabar coast, governed by monarchs
whose authority was paramount to that of every power in
India. These monarchs were diftinguilhed by the appellation
of Balcbara, a name yet known in India ', and it is probable
that the Samorin, or emperor of Calicut, so frequently men-
tioned in the accounts of the first voyages of the Portuguese
to India, poffefled some portion of their dominions. They
celebrate the extraordinary progress which the Indians had
made in astronomical knowledge, a circumstance which seems
to have been unknown to the Greeks and Romans, and afert
that in this branch of science they were far superior to the most
enlightened nations of the East, on which account their
fovcreign was denominated the King of Wisdom '. Other

particularly the excruciating mortifications and penances of ^ _,
the faquirs,, might be produced as proofs of the superior know-
ledge which the Arabians had acquired of the manners of that
people.

THE fame commercial spirit, or religious zeal, which prompted

the Mahomedans of Persia to visit the remotest regions of the
East, animated the Christians of that kingdom. The Ncftorian
churches planted in Persia, under the protection first of its
native sovereigns, and afterwards of its conquerors the Caliphs,
were numerous, and governed by refpedable ecclefiatics.
They had early sent mifflionaries into India, and established
churches in different parts of it, particularly, as I have formerly
related, in the Iland of Ceylon. When the Arabians
extended their navigation as far as China, a more ample field,
both for their commerce and their zeal, opened to their view.
If we may rely on the concurring evidence of Christian authors,
in the East as well as in the Weft, confirmed by the testimony of
the two Mahomedan travellers, their pious labours were attend-
ed with such success, that in the ninth and tenth centuries the
number of Christians in India and China was very confidera-
ble . As the churches in both there countries received all their
eclefiaftics from Persia, where they were ordained by the
Catbolicos, or Neftorian Primate, whose supremacy they ac-
knowledged, this became a regular channel of intercourse and
intelligence; and to the combined effect of all these circum-

fiances,

S E C T. fiances, we are indebted for the information we receive from
x-v., the two Arabian writers', concerning those regions of Aia

which the Greeks and Romans never visited.

BUT while both the Mahomedan and Christian fubjels of

the Caliphs continued to extend their knowledge of the East,
the people of Europe found themselves excluded almost
entirely from any intercourse with it. To them the great
port of Alexandria was now shut, and the new lords of the
Persian Gulf, satisfied with supplying the demand in their own
vast dominions for the commodities of the East, neglected to
convey them, by any of the usual channels, to the trading
towns on the Mediterranean. The opulent inhabitants of
Contantinople, and other great cities of Europe, bore this
deprivation of luxuries, to which they had been long accuf-
tomed, with such impatience, that all the activity of commerce
was exerted, in order to find a remedy for an evil which they
deemed intolerable. The difficulties which were to be fur-
mounted in order to accomplilh this, afford the most striking
proof of the high estimation in which the commodities of the
East were held at that time. The silk of China was purchased in
Chenfi, the westernmost province of that empire, and conveyed
thence by a caravan, in a march of eighty or a hundred days,
to the banks of the Oxus, where it was embarked, and carried
down the stream of that river to the Caspian. After a dan-
gerous voyage across that sea, and ascending the river Cytus as
far as it is navigable, it was conduced by a Lhort land-carriage

of five days to the river Phafis", which falls into the Euxine or S E C T.

IlL.

Black Sea. Thence, by an easy and well known course, it was *
transported to Constantinople. The conveyance of commodities
from that region of the East, now known by the name of In-
doftan, was somewhat less tedious and operose. They were
carried from the banks of the Indus, by a route early frequented,
and which I have already described, either to the river Oxus,
or directly to the Caspian, from which they held the fame
course to ConRfantinople.

IT is obvious, that only commodities of small bulk, and of

considerable value, could bear the expence of such a mode of
conveyance; and in regulating the price of those commodities,
not only the expence, but the rifqie and danger of conveying
them, were to be taken into account. In their journey across
the valt plain extending from Samarcande to the frontier of
China, caravans were exposed to the aftaults and depredations
of the Tartars, the Huns, the Turks, and other roving tribes
which infest the north-east of Alia, and which have always
confidered the merchant and traveller as their lawful prey; nor
were they exempt from insult and pillage in their journey from
the Cyrus to the Phafis, through the kingdom of Colchis, a
country noted, both in ancient and in modern times, for the
thievish disposition of its inhabitants. Even under all there
disadvantages, the trade with the EaR was carried on with
ardour. Constantinople became a considerable mart of Indian
and Chinese commodities, and the wealth which flowed into it

S E C T. in consequence of this, not only added to the splendour of
_L_,-.. that great city, but seems to have retarded, for some time, the

decline of the empire of which it was the capital.

As far as we may venture to conjetlure, from the imper-

sea information of cotemporary historians, it was chiefly by
the mode of conveyance which I have described, perilous and
operose as it was, that Europe was supplied with the commo-
dities of the East, during more than two centuries. Through-
out that period the Christians and Mahomedans were engaged
in almost uninterrupted hostilities; prosecuted with all the
animosity which rivallhip for power, heightened by religious
zeal, naturally excites. Under circumstances which occasioned
such alienation, commercial intercourse could hardly fubfit,
and the merchants of Christendom either did not resort at all
to Alexandria, and the ports of Syria, the ancient fLaples for
the commodities of the East, after they were in pofleffion of
the Mahomedans, or if the love of gain, surmounting their
abhorrence of the Infidels, prompted them to visit the marts
which they had long frequented, it was with much caution and
distrust.

WHILE the difficulties of procuring the producions of the

East were thus augmented, the people of Europe became more
desirous of obtaining them. About this time some cities of
Italy, particularly Amalphi and Venice, having acquired a
greater degree of independence than they formerly poflefled,
began to cultivate the arts of domestic industry, with an ardour
and ingenuity uncommon in the middle ages. The effed of

i I these

these exertions was such an increase of wealth, as created new S E C T.
wants and desires, and forml a taste for elegance and luxury, .
which induced them to visit foreign countries in order to
gratify it. Among men in this Rage of their advance-
ment, the productions of India have always been held in high
estimation, and from this period they were imported into Italy
in larger.quantities,. and came into more general use. Several
circumstances which indicate this revival of a commercial spirit,
are collected by the industrious Muratori, and, from the close
of the seventh century, an. attentive observer may discern faint.
traces of its progress °.

of historical materials seems to be abundantly ample,. so little
attention has been paid to the operations of commerce, that
every attempt towards a.regular deduaion of them,. has been
found an undertaking of the utmoR difficulty. The era,
however, to which I have conducted. this Disquisition, is one
of the periods in the annals of mankind. concerning which
history furnishes most scanty information. As it was chiefly
in the Greek empire, and in. some cities of Italy, that any
efforts were made to procure the commodities of India, and
the other regions of the East, it is only from the HiRorians
of those countries we can expe& to find any account of that
trade. But from the age of Mahomet, until the time when.

of more than four centuries and a half, the Byzantine history is
contained in meagre chronicles, the compilers of which fel-
dom extended their views beyond the intrigues in the palace,
the factions in the theatre, or the disputes of theologians.
To them the monkish annalists of the different Rates and cities
of Italy, during the fame period, are (if poflible) far inferior
in merit, and in the early accounts of those cities which have
been mot celebrated for their commercial spirit, we search
with little success for the origin or nature of that trade by
which they first rose to eminence P. It is manifest, however,
from the slightest attention to the events which happened in
the seventh and eighth centuries, that the Italian states, while
their coasts were continually infested by the Mahomedans, who
had made some settlements there, and had fubje&ed Sicily
almost entirely to their dominion, could not trade with much
confidence and security in Egypt and Syria. With what
implacable hatred Chriflians viewed Mahomedans, as the dif-
ciples of an impostor, is well known; and as all the nations
which professed the Christian faith, both in the Ealf and Weft,
had mingled the worship of angels and faints with that of the
Supreme Being, and had adorned their churches with picures
and statues; the true Mofems confidered themselves as the
only affertors of the unity of God, and beheld Christians of
every denomination with abhorrence, as idolaters. Much time
was requisite to soften this mutual animosity, so far as to rea-
der intercourse in any degree cordial.

not only to spread in Italy, but, from imitation of the Italians, . _l
or from some improvement in their own situation, the people
of Marseilles, and other towns of France on the Mediterranean,
became equally fond of them. But the profits exa&ed by the
merchants of Amalphi or Venice, from whom they received
those precious commodities, were so exorbitant as prompted
them to make some effort to supply their own demands.
With this view, they not only opened a trade with Conftan-
tinople, but ventured at times to visit the ports of Egypt and
Syria . This eagerness of the Europeans, on the one hand,
to obtain the productions of India, and, on the other hand,
the immense advantages which both the Caliphs and their
fubjcEts derived from the sale of them, induced both so far to
conceal their reciprocal antipathy, as to carry on a traffic
manifestly for their common benefit. How far this traffic
extended, and in what mode it was conducted by these new
adventurers, the scanty information which can be gathered
from contemporary writers, does not enable me to trace with
accuracy. It is probable, however, that this communication
would have produced insensibly its usual effect, of familiarizing
and reconciling men of hostile principles and discordant man-
ners to one another, and a regular commerce might have been
eltablilhed gradually between Christians and Mahometans,
upon such equal terms, that the nations of Europe might
have received all the luxuries of the East, by the fame channels
in which they were formerly conveyed to them, first by the

BUT whatever might have been the influence of this grow-

ing correspondence, it was prevented from operating with
full effect by the crusades, or expeditions for the recovery
of the Holy Land, which, during two centuries, occupied the
professors of the two rival religions, and contributed to alie-
nate them more than ever from each other. I have, in ano-
ther work', contemplated mankind while under the dominion
.of this frenzy, the moif fmgular, perhaps, and the longest
continued, of any fhat occurs in the history of our species;
and I pointed out such effeds of it upon government, upon
property, upon manners and tafe, as were suited to what
xwere then the obje&s of my enquiry. At present my atten-
tion is confined to observe the commercial consequences of the
crusades, and how far they contributed to retard, or to promote,
the conveyance of Indian commodities into Europe.

To fix an idea of peculiar faniaty to that country, which

the Author of our Religion fele&ed as the place of his refi-
dence while on earth, and in which he accomplished the
redemption of mankind, is a sentiment so natural to the
human mind, that, from the first eftablilhment of Christianity,
the visiting of the holy places in Judea was confidered as an
exercise of piety, tending powerfully to awaken and to cherish

a spirit of devotion. Through succeeding ages, the pracice S E C T.

continuedi and increased in every part of Christendom, When _
Jerusalem was fubjeRed to the Mahomedan empire, and
danger was added to the fatigue and expence of a distant
pilgrimage, the undertaking was viewed as fill more merito-
rious. It was sometimes enjoined as a penance to be perform-
ed by heinous transgressors. It was more frequently a duty
undertaken with voluntary zeal, and in both cafes it was
deemed an expiation for all palt offences. From various causes,
which I have elsewhere enumerated', these pious visits to the
Holy Land multiplied amazingly during the tenth and eleventh
centuries. Not only individuals in the lower and middle ranks
of life, but persons of superior condition, attended by large
retinues, and numerous caravans of opulent pilgrims, resorted
to Jerusalem.

IN all their operations, however, men have a wonderful

dexterity in mingling some attention to interest with those
functions which seem to be most purely spiritual. The Ma-
homedan caravans which, in obedience to the injunctions of
their religion, visit the holy temple of Mecca, are not com-
posed, as I thall hereafter explain more fully, of devout pil-
grims only, but of merchants, who, both in going and return-
ing, are provided with such an aflortment of goods, that they
carry on a considerable traffic . Even the Faquirs of India,
whose wild enthusiasm seems to elevate them above all folici-

Ei C T. tude about the concerns of this world, have rendered their
Ill.
--e . frequent pilgrimages subservient to their interest, by trading in

every country through which' they travel". In like manner,
it was not by devotion alone that such numerous bands of
Christian pilgrims were induced to visit Jerusalem. To many
of them commerce was the chief motive of undertaking that
ditant voyage, and by exchanging the productions of Europe
for the more valuable commodities of Asia, particularly those
of India, which at that time were diffused through every part
of the Caliphs dominions, they enriched themselves, and fur-
nifhed their countrymen with such an additional supply of
Eastern luxuries, as augmented their relilh for them .

BUT how faint soever the lines may be, which, prior to the

crusades, mark the influence of the frequent pilgrimages to
the East upon commerce, they become so conspicuous after
the commencement of these expeditions, as to meet the eye of
every observer. Various circumstances concurred towards this,
from an enumeration of which it will appear, that by attend-
ing to the progress and effelts of the crusades, considerable
light is thrown upon the subjet of my inquiries. Great
armies, conduced by the most illustrious nobles of Europe,
and composed of men of the moit enterprising spirit in all the
kingdoms of it, marched towards Palestine, through countries
far advanced beyond those which they left, in every species of
improvement. They beheld the dawn of prosperity in the

republics of Italy, which had begun to vie with each other in S E C T.
the arts of industry, and in their efforts to engross the lucra-
tive commerce with the East. They next admired the more
advanced Rate of opulence and splendour in Constantinople,
raited to a pre-eminence above all the cities then known, by
its extensive trade, particularly that which it carried on with
India, and the countries beyond it. They afterwards served in
those provinces of Asia through which the commodities of the
East were usually conveyed, and became matiers of several
cities which had been staples of that trade. They eftablilhed
the kingdom of Jerusalem, which subsisted near two hundred
years. They took possession of the throne of the Greek em-
pire, and governed it above half a century. Amid f such a
variety of events and operations, the ideas of the fierce
warriors of Europe gradually opened and improved; they
became acquainted with the policy and arts of the people
whom they subdued; they observed the sources of their
wealth, and availed themselves of all this knowledge. Antioch
and Tyre, when conquered by the crusaders, were flourishing
cities, inhabited by opulent merchants, who supplied all the
nations trading in the Mediterranean with the productions of
the East , and as far as can be gathered from incidental occur-
rences, mentioned by the HiRorians of the Holy War, who,
being mostly priests and monks, had their attention direced to
obje&s very different from those relating to commerce, there
is reason to believe that both in Constantinople, while subjec

S E C T. to the Franks, and in the ports of Syria acquired by the-

lIl.

. Christians, the long-eftabliihed trade with the East continued to-

be protected and encouraged.

BUT though commerce may have been only a secondary.

objea with the martial leaders of the crusades, engaged in.
perpetual hoftilites with the Turks on one hand, and with
the Soldans of Egypt on the other, it was the primary obje&
with the associates, in conjundtion with whom they carried on
their operations. Numerous as the armies were which assumed
the crof/, and enterprising as the fanatical zeal was with
which they were animated, they could not have accomplished
their purpose, or even have reached the feat of their warfare,
without securing the afiftance of the Italian fates. None of the
other European powers could either furnish a sufficient number
of transports to convey the armies of the crusaders to the coaf
of Dalmatia, whence they marched to Constantinople, the place
of general rendezvous; or were able to supply them with
military stores and provisions in such abundance as to enable
them to invade a distant country. In all the fucceflive expe-
ditions, the fleets cf the Genoese, of the Pilans, or of the
Venetians, kept on the coast as the armies advanced by land,
and supplying them, from time to time, with whatever was
wanting, engrofTed all the profits of a branch of commerce
which, in every age, has been extremely lucrative. It was
with all the interested attention of merchants, that the Italians
afforded their aid. On the reduction of any place in which
they found it for their interest to fettle, they obtained from
the crufadcrs valuable immunities of different kinds; freedom
lo8

of

of trade; an abatement of the usual duties paid for what S E C T.
was imported and exported, or a total exemption from them;
the property of entire suburbs in some cities, and of extensive
streets in others; and a privilege granted to every person who
resided within their precincts, or who traded under their pro-
tecion, of being tried by their own laws, and by judges of
their own appointment '. In consequence of so many advan-
tages, we can trace, during the progress of the crusades, a
rapid increase of wealth and of power in all the commercial
states of Italy. Every port open to trade was frequented by
their merchants, who, having now engrodfed entirely the com-
merce of the East, strove with such active emulation to find
new markets for the commodities which it furnished, that they
extended a taste for them to many parts of Europe in which
they had hitherto been little known.

Two events happened, prior to the termination of the Holy

War, which, by acquiring to the Venetians and Genoese the
pofleffion of several provinces in the Greek empire, enabled
them to supply Europe more abundantly with all the produc-
tions of the East. The first was the conquest of Conftanti-
nople, in the year one thousand two hundred and four, by the
Venetians, and the leaders of the fourth crusade. An account
of the political intcrefts and intrigues which formed this
alliance, and turned the hallowed arms deflined to deliver the
Holy City from the dominion of infidels, against a Christian
monarch, is foreign from the design. of this Disquisition.

S E C T. Constantinople was taken by storm, and plundered by the confe-

The dominions which still remained fubje& to the successors of
Conflantine, were divided into four parts, one of which being
allotted to the new emperor, for supporting the dignity and
expence of government, an equal partition of the other three
was made between the Venetians and the chiefs of the crusade.
The former, who, both in concerting and in conducting this
enterprise, kept their eye feadily fixed on what might be
most for the emolument of their commerce, secured the ter-
ritories of greatest value to a trading people. They obtained
some part of the Peloponnefus, at that time the feat of flourilh-
ing manufactures, particularly of silk. They became matiers
of several of the largefl and bell cultivated islands in the
Archipelago, and eftablilhed a chain of settlements,' partly
military and partly commercial, extending from the Adriatic
to the Bosphorus'. Many Venetians fettled in Conftantinoplc,
and without obflruclion from their warlike associates, little
attentive to the arts of induftrv, they engrossed the various
branches of trade which had so long enriched that capital.
Two of these particularly attracted their attention; the silk
trade, and that with India. From the reign of Justinian, it
was moflly in Greece, and some of the adjacent illands, that
silk-worms, which he first introduced into Europe, were
reared. The product of their labours was manufatured
into fluffs of various kinds in many cities of the empire.

greatest, and there, of consequence, the commerce of silk
naturally centered. In assorting cargoes for the several ports
in which they traded, the Venetians had for some time found
silk to be an eflential article, as it continued to grow more and
more into request in every part of Europe. By the residence
of so many of their citizens in ConRantinople, and by the
immunities granted to them, they not only procured silk il
such abundance, and on such terms, as enabled them to carry
on trade more extensively, and with greater profit than for-
merly, but they became so thoroughly acquainted with every
branch of the silk manufacture, as induced them to attempt
the establishment of it in their own dominions. The measures
taken for this purpose by individuals, as well as the regulations
framed by the state, were concerted with so much prudence,
and executed with such success, that in a ihort time the silk
fabrics of Venice vied with those of Greece and Sicily, and
contributed both to enrich the republic, and to enlarge the
sphere of its commerce. At the fame time, the Venetians
availed themselves of the influence which they had acquired
in ConRfantinople, in order to improve their Indian trade.
The capital of the Greek empire, besides the means of being
supplied with the productions of the East, which it enjoyed
in common with the other commercial cities of Europe, re-
ceived a considerable portion of them by a channel peculiar to
itself. Some of the most valuable commodities of India and
China were conveyed over land, by routes which I have
delcribed, to the Black Sea, and thence by a (hort navigation

to

11

S E C T. to Constantinople. To this market, the best stored of any

_ . except Alexandria, the Venetians had now easy accefi, and the

goods which they purchased there, made an addition of great
consequence to what they were accustomea to acquire in the
ports of Egypt and Syria. Thus while the Latin empire in
Constantinople subsisted, the Venetians possessed such advantages
over all their rivals, that their commerce extended greatly, and
it was chiefly from them every part of Europe received the
commodities of the Eaf.

THE other event which I had in view, was the subversion

of the dominion of the Latins in Constantinople, and the re-
eftablilhment of the Imperial family on the throne. This was
effeced after a period of fifty-feven years, partly by a transient
effort of vigour, with which indignation at a foreign yoke
animated the Greeks, and partly by the powerful afiftance
which they received from the republic of Genoa. The
Genoese were so sensible of the advantages which the Vene-
tians, ther rivals in trade, derived from their union with the
Latin emperors of Constantinople, that in order to deprive
them of these, they surmounted the most deep-rooted pre-
judices of their age, and combined with the schismatic Greeks
to dethrone a monarch prote&ted by the Papal power, setting at
defiance the thunders of the Vatican, which at that time made the
greatest princes tremble. This undertaking, bold and impious as
it was then deemed, proved successful. In recompence for their
signal services, the gratitude or weaknefL of the Greek emperor,
among other donations, bellowed upon the Genoese Pera, the
chief suburb of Constantinople, to be held as a fief of the empire,

goods imported and exported, as gave them a decided fupe- . _
riority over every competitor in trade. With the vigilant
attention of merchants, the Genoese availed themselves of this
favourable situation. They surrounded their new settlement in
Pera with fortifications. They rendered their factories on the
adjacent coasts places of itrength b. They were maflers of
the harbour of Conflantinople more than the Greeks them-
selves. The whole trade of the Black Sea came into their
hands; and not satisfied with this, they took poffeflion of part
of the Cherfonefus Taurica, the modern Crimaa, and rendered
Caffa, its principal town, the chief feat of their trade with the
East, and the port in which all its productions, conveyed to
the Black Sea by the different routes I have formerly described,
were landed'.

IN consequence of this revolution, Genoa became the

greatest commercial power in Europe; and if the enterprising
industry and intrepid courage of its citizens had been under
the direction of wife domestic policy, it might have long held
that rank. But never was there a contrast more striking, than
between the internal administration of the two rival republics
of Venice and Genoa. In the former, government was con-
duded with feady systematic prudence; in the latter, it was

S E C T. confifent in nothing but a fondness for novelty, and a pro-

I/L
,,_T penfity to change. The one enjoyed a perpetual calm, the

other was agitated with all the forms and vicilitudes of faction.
The increase of wealth, which flowed into Genoa from the
exertions of its merchants, did not counterbalance the defects
in its political constitution; and even in its most prosperous
fate we may discern the appearance of symptoms which fore-
boded a diminution of its opulence and power.

As long, however, as the Genoese retained the ascendant

which they had acquired in the Greek empire, the Venetians
felt their commercial transactions with it to be carried on upon
such unequal terms, that their merchants visited Confiantinople
seldom, and with reluc:ance; and in order to procure the
commodities of the East in such quantities as were demanded
in the various parts of Europe which they were accustomed to
i;lpply, they were obliged to resort to the ancient flaples of
:'iat trade. Of there Alexandria was the chief, and the most
:.undantly lupplied, as the conveyance of Indian goods by
land through Asia, to any of the ports of the Mediterranean,
wras oftec rendered impradicable by the incursions of Turks,
Tartars, and other hordes, which successively desolated that
fertile country, or contended for the dominion of it. But
under the military and vigorous government of the Soldans
of the Mameluks, security and order were fReadily maintained
in Egypt, and trade, though loaded with heavy duties, was
open to all. In proportion to the progress of the Genoese, in
ungroffing the commerce of Contantinople and the Black

large their tranfaiions with Alexandria. L

BUT such an avowed intercourse with infidels being con-

fidered, in that age, as unbecoming the character of Chriflians,
the lenate of Venice, in order to silence its own scruples, or
those of its subjeCts, had recourse to the infallible authority of
the Pope, who was supposed to be possessed of power to dif-
penfe with the rigorous observation of the most sacred laws,
and obtained permission from him to fit out annually a fpeci-
fled number of flips for the ports of Egypt and of Syria*.
Under this fanaion, the republic concluded a treaty of com-
merce with the Soldaus of Egypt, on equitable terms; in con-
sequence of which the senate appointed one consul to reside in
Alexandria, and another in Damascus, in a public charaacer,
and to exerciie a mercantile jurifdiaion, authorised by the
Soldans. Under their protecion, Venetian merchants and
artisans fettled in each of these cities. Ancient prejudices
and antipathies were forgotten, and their mutual interests efta-
blifhed, for the firtf time, a fair and open trade between Chris-
tians and Mahomedans'.

WHILE the Venetians and Genoese were alternately making

those extraordinary efforts, in order to engross all the advan-
tages of supplying Europe with the producions of the East,

' of the people, as well as the nature of their institutions, were

so favourable to its progress, that the state advanced rapidly in
power, and the people in opulence. But as the Florentines
did not possess any commodious sea-port, their acive exertions
were direced chiefly towards the improvement of their ma-
nufactures, and domestic industry. About the beginning of
the fourteenth century, the Florentine manufatures of various
kinds, particularly those of silk and woollen cloth, appear from
the enumeration of a well-informed Historian, to have been
very considerable . The connection which they formed in
different parts of Europe, by furnilhing them with the pro-
duaions of their own indufiry, led them to engage in another
branch of trade, that of banking. In this they soon became
so eminent, that the money-tranfa&ions of almoR every king-
dom in Europe passed through their hands, and in many of
them they were entrusted with the colletion and administration
of the public revenues. In consequence of the acivity and success
with which they conduced their manufactures and money-
tranfascions, the former always attended with certain though
moderate profit, the latter lucrative in an high degree, at a
period when neither the interest of money, nor the premium
on bills of exchange, were fettled with accuracy, Florence
became one of the first cities in Christendom, and many of its
citizens extremely opulent. Cosmo di Medici, the head of a
family which rose from obscurity by its success in trade, was
reckoned the most wealthy merchant ever known in Eu-

generosity, in the patronage of learning, and in the encou-
ragement of useful and elegant arts, no monarch of the age
could vie with him. Whether the Medici, in their first mer-
cantile tranfadions, carried on any commerce with the East, I
have not been able to discover'. It is more probable, I should
think, that their trade was confined to the fame articles with
that of their countrymen. But as soon as the commonwealth,
by the conquest of Pisa, had acquired a communication with A.C. 1405.
the ocean, Cosmo di Medici, who had the chief direction of
its affairs, endeavoured to procure for his country a share in
that lucrative commerce, which had raised Venice and Genoa
so far above all the other Italian states. With this view am- A.C. 1425.
bafladors were sent to Alexandria, in order to prevail with the
Soldan to open that, and the other ports of his dominions, to
the fubjeds of the republic, and to admit them to a participa-
tion of all the commercial privileges which were enjoyed by
the Venetians. The negociation terminated with such success,
that the Florentines seem to have obtained some Ihare in the
Indian trade k; and soon after this period, we find spices enu-
merated among the commodities imported by the Florentines
into England'.

S E C T. IN some parts of this Difuiition, concerning the nature
__ . and course of trade with the East, I have been obliged to

grope my way, and often under the guidance of very feeble
lights. But as we are now approaching to the period when
the modern ideas, with refpeC to the importance of commerce,
began to unfold, and attention to its progress and effects became
a more conliderable obje& of policy, we may hope to carry
on what researches yet remain to be made, with greater cer-
tainty and precision. To this growing attention we arc
indebted for the account which Marino Sanudo, a Venetian
nobleman, gives of the Indian trade, as carriel on by his
countrymen, about the beginning of the fourteenth century.
They were supplied, as he informs us, with the produtions
of the East in two different ways. Those of small bulk and
high value, such as cloves, nutmegs, mace, gems, pearls, &c.
were conveyed from the Perlian Gulf up the Tigris to Baffora,
and thence to Bagdat, from which they were carried to iomc
port on the Mediterranean. All more bulky goods, such as
pepper, ginger, cinnamon, &c. together with some portion of
the more valuable articles, were conveyed by the ancient route
to the Red Sea, and thence across the defart, and down the
Nile to Alexandria. The goods received by the former
route were, as Sanudo observes, of superior puality but
from the tedioufilefs and expence of a diflant land-carriage,
the supply was often scanty, nor can he conceal (though
contrary to a favourite proje& which he had in view when
he wrote the treatise to which I refer) that, from the state
of the countries through which the caravans passed, this

6 mode

mode of conveyance was frequently precarious, and attended S E C T.
with danger ".

IT was in Alexandria only, that the Venetians found always

a certain and fuill supply of Indian goods; and as these were
conveyed thither chiefly by water-carriage, they might have
purchased them at a moderate price, if the Soldans had not
imposed upon them duties which amounted to a third part of
their full value. Under this and every other disadvantage,
however, it was neceflary to procure them, as from many con-
curring circumstances, particularly a more extensive intercourse
eltablilhed among the different nations of Europe, the demand
for them continued to increase greatly during the fourteenth
century. By the irruptions of the various hotlile tribes of
Barbarians, who took pofleflion of the greater part of Europe,
that powerful bond by which the Romans had united together
all the people of their vast empire was entirely dissolved, and
fitch difcouiragement was given to the communication of one
nation with another, as Would appear altogether incredible, if
the evidence of it refted only upon the testimony of historians,
and were not confirmed by what is till more authentic, the
cxprefs enadmcnt of laws. Several tfatutes of this kind,
which difgracc the jurifpruderice of almost every Europeant
nation, I have enumerated and explained' in' anothei w-ork'.
But when the wants and dcfires of men multiplied; and they
found that other countries could furhif the means of supplying'

S EC T. and gratifying them, the hostile sentiments which kept

Ill. _ t. nations at a distance from each other abated, and mutual

correspondence gradually took place. From the time of the
crusades, which first brought people hardly known to one
another, to associate and to aft in concert during two centuries,
in pursuit of one common end, several circumstances had co-ope-
rated towards accelerating this general intercourse. The people
around the Baltic, hitherto dreaded and abhorred by the reft
of Europe as pirates and invaders, assumed more pacific
manners, and began now to visit their neighbours as merchants.
Occurrences foreign from the fubje& of the present inquiry,
united them together in the powerful commercial confederacy
so famous in the middle ages, under the name of the Hanseatic
League, and led them to eftablilh the staple of their trade with
the southern parts of Europe in Bruges. Thither the merchants
of Italy, particularly those of Venice, resorted; and in return
for the productions of the East, and the manufacures of their
own country, they received not only the naval stores and other
commodities of the North, but a considerable supply of gold
and silver from the mines in various provinces of Germany, the
moR valuable and produaive of any known at that time in
Europe°. Bruges continued to be the great mart or store-
house of European trade during the period to which my in-
quiries extend. A regular communication, formerly unknown,
was kept up there among all the kingdoms into which our con-
tinent is divided, and we are enabled to account for the rapid
progress of the Italian fates in wealth and power, by observing

how much their trade, the source from which both were S E C T.
derived, must have augmented upon the vast increase in the
consumption of Asiatic goods, when all the extensive coun-
tries towards the north-ealt of Europe were opened for their
reception.

DuRIrN this prosperous and improving state of'Indian

commerce, Venice received from one of its citizens, such new
information concerning the countries which produced the pre-
cious commodities that formed the most valuable article of its
trade, as gave an idea of their opulence, their population, and
their extent, which rose far above all the former conceptions of
Europeans. From the time that the Mahomedans became
matiers of Egypt, as no chriRian was permitted to pass through
their dominions to the East , the direc intercourie of Europeans
with India ceased entirely. The account of India by Cofmas
Indico-pleuftes in the sixth century, is, as far as I know, the
lad which the nations of the Well received from any person who
had visited that country. But about the middle of the thir-
teenth century, the spirit of commerce, now become more
enterprizing, and more eager to discover new routes which led to
wealth, induced Marco Polo, a Venetian of a noble family,
after trading for some time in many of the opulent citiesof
the lelfer Asia, to penetrate into the more eastern parts of that
continent, as far as to the court of the Great Khan on the fron-
tier of China. During the course of twenty-fix years, partly

and Guzzerat, by their present names, as great and opulent king-

made more than one voyage in the Indian ocean, and acquired
some information concerning an island which he calls Zipangri or
Cipango, probably Japan. He visited in person Java, and several
islands contiguous to it, the island of Ceylon, and the coast of
Malabar as far as the Gulf of Cambay, to all which he gives
the names that they now bear. This was the most extensive fur-
vey hitherto made of the East, and the most complete description
of it ever given by any European; and in an age which had
hardly any knowledge ofthofe regions but what was derived from
the geography of Ptolemy, not only the Venetians, but all the
people of Europe, were astonished at the discovery of immense
countries opened to their view beyond what had hitherto been
reputed the utmost boundary of the earth in that quarter'.

sequences; an event happened, that drew the attention of all -
Europe, and had a most conspicuous effect upon the course of
that trade, the progress of which I am endeavouring to trace.

THE event to which I allude, is the final conquet of the

Greek empire by Mahomet II. and the establishing the feat of A. D. 1453.
the Turkiih government in Constantinople. The immediate
effect of this great revolution was, that the Genoese residing in
Pera, involved in the general calamity, were obliged not only
to abandon that settlement, but all those which they had made on
the adjacent sea-coast, after they had been in their poflefllon near
two centuries. Not long after, the vicorious arms of the A.D.1474.
Sultan expelled them from Caffa, and every other place which
they held in the Crimea'. Conflantinople was no longer a mart
open to the nations of the Weft for Indian commodities, and
no supply of them could now be obtained but in Egypt and
the ports of Syria, fubjetl to the Soldans of the Mameluks.
The Venetians, in consequence of the protection and privileges
which they had secured by their commercial treaty with those
powerful princes, carried on trade in every part of their domi-
nions with such advantage, as gave them a superiority over every
competitor. Genoa, which had long been their most formi-
dable rival, humbled by the loss of its pofleflions in the East,
and weakened by domeitic dissensions, declined so fast, that it
was obliged to court foreign protection, and Submitted alter-
nately to the dominion of the Dukes of Milan and the Kings
of France. In consequence of this diminution of their political

R 2

S E C T. power, the commercial exertions of the Genoese became less

, vigorous. A feeble attempt which they made to recover that

share of the Indian trade which they had formerly enjoyed, by
offering to enter into treaty with the Soldans of Egypt upoa
terms similar to those which had been granted to the Venetians,
proved unsuccessful; and during the remainder of the fifteenth
century, Venice supplicd the greater part of Europe with the
productions of the East, and carried on trade to an extent far
beyond what had been known in those times.

THE state of the other European nations was extremely fa-

vourable to the commercial progress of the Venetians. England,
desolated by the civil wars which the unhappy contest between
the houses of York and Lancaster excited, had hardly begun
to turn its attention towards those obje&s and pursuits to
which it is indebted for its present opulence and power. In
France, the fatal effets of the Engliih arms and conquests
were still felt, and the king had neither acquired power, nor
the people inclination, to direc the national genius and ativity
to the arts of peace. The union of the different kingdoms of
Spain was not yet completed; some of its molt fertile pro-
vinces were fill under the dominion of the Moors, with whom
the Spanilh monarchs waged perpetual war; and, except by the
Catalans, little attention was paid to foreign trade. Portugal,
though it had already entered upon that career of discovery
which terminated with mos splendid success, had not yet
made such progress in it as to be entitled to any high rank
among the commercial fates of Europe. Thus the Venetians,
almost without rival or competitor, except from some of the

ecute their mercantile plans; and the trade with the cities of ,_-
the Hanseatic League, which united the North and South of
Europe, and which hitherto had been common to all the
Italians, was now engrossed, in a great measure, by them,
alone..

WHILE the increasing demand for the prodidions of Asia

induced all the people of Europe to court intercourse with the
Venetians so eagerly, as to allure them, by various immunities,
to frequent their fea-portsi we may observe a peculiarity in
their mode of carrying on trade with the East, which dif-
tinguifhes it from what has taken place in other countries in
any period of history. In the ancient world, the Tyrians,
the Greeks who were matiers of Egypt, and the Romans,
failed to India in quest of those commodities with which they
supplied the people of the Weft. In modern times, the fame
has been the practice of the Portuguese, the Dutch, the Englilh,
and, after their example, of other European nations. In both
periods loud complaints have been made, that in carrying on this
trade every state muff be drained of the precious metals which,.
in the course of it, flow incessantly from the Weft to the Eaf,.
never to return. From whatever loss might have been occasioned
by this gradual but unavoidable diminution of their gold and silver
(whether a real or only an imaginary loss, it is not incumbent
upon me, in this place, to inquire or to determine), the Venetians
were, in a great measure, exempted. They had no direa inter-
course with India. They found in Egypt, or in Syria, warehouses
filled with all the commodities of the East, imported by the Ma-

homedans;

12$

E C T. homedans; and from the best accounts we have, with refpec to

_ the nature of their trade, they purchased them more frequently by

barter, than with ready money. Egypt, the chief mart for
Indian goods, though a most fertile country, is deffitute of many
things requisite in an improved state of society, either for
accommodation or for ornament. Too limited in extent, and
too highly cultivated to afford space for forells; too level to
have mines of the useful metals; it must be supplied with
timber for building, with iron, lead, tin, and brass, by import-
ation from other countries. The Egyptians, while under the
dominion of the Mameluks, seem not themselves to have
traded in the ports of any Christian tate, and it was principally
from the Venetians that they received all the articles which I
have enumerated. Besides there, the ingenuity of the Vene-
tian artists furnished a variety of manufactures of woollen
doths, silk stuffs of various fabric, camblets, mirrors, arms,
ornaments of gold and silver, glass, and many other articles,
for all which they found a ready market in Egypt and Syria.
In return they received from the merchants of Alexandria,
fpicts of every kind, drugs, gems, pearls, ivory, cotton and
silk, unwrought as well as manufacured, in many different
forms, and other producions of the East, together with several
valuable articles of Egyptian growth or fabric. In Aleppo,
Baruth, and other cities, besides the proper commodities of
India brought thither by land, they added to their cargoes the
carpets of Persia, the rich wrought silks of Damascus, fill
known by a name taken from that city, and various produc-
tions of art and nature peculiar to Syria, Palefline, and Arabia.
If, at any time, their demand for the productions of the East

own manufactures, that trade with the cities of the Hanseatic ._
League, which I have mentioned, furnished them from the
mines of Germany, with a regular supply of gold and silver,
which they could carry, with advantage, to the markets of
Egypt and Syria.

FROM a propensity, remarkable in all commercial fiates, to'

subjet the operations of trade to political regulation and
reltraint, the authority of the Venetian government seems to
have been interposcd, both in direcing the importation of
Asiatic goods, and in the mode of circulating them among
the different nations of Europe. To every considerable faple
in the Mediterranean a certain number of large vessels,.
known by the name of Galeons or Caracks, was fitted out
on the public account, and returned loaded with the richest
merchandise ', the profit arising from tie sale of which mulf
have been no slender addition to the revenue of the re-
public. Citizens, however, of every class, particularly persons
of noble families, were encouraged to engage in foreign
trade, and whoever employed a vessel of a certain burden for
this purpose, received a considerable bounty from the fate".
It was in the fame manner, partly in ihips belonging to.
the public, and partly in those of private traders, that the
Venetians circulated through Europe the goods imported from

TaEiE are two different ways by which we may come at

some knowledge of the magnitude of those branches of com-
merce carried on by the Venetians. The one, by attending to
the great variety and high value of the commodities which
they imported into Bruges, the store-house from which the
other nations of Europe were supplied. A full enumeration
of there is given by a well-informed author, in which is con-
tained almost every article deemed, in that age, essential to
accommodation or to elegance'. The other, by confidering
the effeds of the Venetian trade upon the cities admitted to a
participation of its advantages. Never did wealth appear
more conspicuously in the train of commerce. The citizens
of Bruges, enriched by it, displayed in their dress, their build-
ings, and mode of living, such magnificence as even to mortify
the pride and excite the envy of royalty'. Antwerp, when
the staple was removed thither, soon rivalled Bruges in opu-
lence and splendour. In some cities of Germany, particularly
in Auglburg, the great mart for Indian commodities in the
interior parts of that extensive country, we meet with early
examples of such large fortunes accumulated by mercantile
industry, as raised the proprietors of them to high rank and
consideration in the empire.

FROM
13

FROM observing this remarkable increase of opulence in all the S E C T.

places where the Venetians had an eftablithcd trade, we are led
to conclude, that the profit accruing to themlclves from the
different branches of it, especially that with the Eaif, mult
have been fIill more considerable. It is impolFible, however,
without information much more minute than that to which
we have access, to form an estimate of this with accuracy;
but various circumstances may be produced to eflablifi, in
general, the juflnels of this conclusion. From the firfl revival
of a commercial spirit in Europe, the Venetians poflefled a
large lhare of the trade with the E:ft. It continued gradually
to increase, and during a great part of the fifteenth century,
they had nearly a monopoly of it. This was productive of
consequences attending all monopolies. Wherever there is no
competition, and the merchant has it in his power to regulate
the market, and to fix the price of the commodities which he
vends, his gains will be exorbitant. Some idea of their mag-
nitude, during several centuries, may be formed, by attending
to the rate of the premium or interest then paid for the use
of motey. This is undoubtedly the most exac flandard by
which to meafinre the profit arising from the capital flock
employed in commerce; for, according as the interest of money
is high or low, the gain acquired by the use of it mufl vary,
and become exceflive or moderate. From the close of the
eleventh century to the commencement of the fixtcenth,
the period during which the Italians made thcir chief com-
mercial exertions, the rate of interest was extremely high. It
ewas ufiually twenty per cent. Iomnctimcs above that; and Ib l.te

IIt. * of a trade so extensive as that of the Venetians corresponded

to this high value of money, it could not fail of proving a
source of great wealth, both public and private'. The con-
dition of Venice, accordingly, during the period under review,
is described by writers of that age, in terms which are not
applicable to that of any other country in Europe. The
revenues of the republic, as well as the wealth amafled by
individuals, exceeded whatever was elsewhere known. In the
magnificence of their houses, in richness of furniture, in
profusion of plate, and in every thing which contributed cither
towards elegance or parade in their mode of living, the nobles
of Venice surpassed the state of the greatest monarch beyond
the Alps. Nor was all this display the effet of an ostentatious
and inconsiderate dissipation, it was the natural consequence
of successful industry, which, having accumulated wealth with
ease, is entitled to enjoy it in splendour b.

NEVER did the Venetians believe the power of their country

to be more firmly eftablilied, or rely with greater confidence
on the continuance and increase of its opulence, than towards
the clofc of the fifteenth century, when two events (which
they could neither foresee nor prevent) happened, that proved
fatal to both. The one was the discovery of America. The
other was the opening a diret course of navigation to the Ealt
Indies, by the Cape of Good Hope. Of all occurrences in

the most interesting; and as they occasioned a remarkable
change ofintercourfe among the different quarters of the globe,
and finally eltabliflied those commercial ideas and arrangements
which conltitute the chief diftinaion between the manners
and policy of ancient and of modern times, an account of them is
intimately conneced with the fubje& of this Disquisition,
and will bring it to that period which I have fixed upon for
its boundary. But as I have related the rife and progress of
these discoveries at great length in another work ', a rapid view
of them is all that is requisite in this place.

THE admiration or envy with which the other nations of

Europe beheld the power and wealth of Venice, led them na-
turally to enquire into the causes of this pre-eminence; and
among there, its lucrative commerce with the East appeared
to be by far the mot considerable. Mortified with being ex-
cluded from a source of opulence, which to the Venetians had
proved so abundant, different countries had attempted to ac-
quire a {hare of the Indian trade. Some of the Italian Rates
(as I have formerly hinted) endeavoured to obtain admission
into the ports of Egypt and Syria, upon the fame terms with
the Venetians; but either by the superior interest of the
Venetians in the court of the Soldans, their negociations for
that purpose were rendered unsuccessful; or from the mani-
fold advantages which merchants, long in poffeflion of any
branch of trade, have in a competition with new adventurers,

S E C T. all their exertions did not produce effects of any confequenced.

In other countries, various schemes were formed with the
fame view. As early as the year one thousand four hun-
dred and eighty, the inventive and enterprising genius of
Columbus conceived the idea of opening a shorter and more
certain communication with India, by holding a diret weflerly
course towards those regions, which, according to Marco Polo
and other travellers, extended eastward far beyond the utmost
limits of Asia known to the Greeks or Romans. This
scheme, supported by arguments deduced from a scientific
acquaintance with cosmography, from his own praCtical know-
ledge of navigation, from the reports of skilful pilots, and
from the theories and conjeCtures of the ancients, he proposed
first to the Genoese his countrymen, and next to the king of
Portugal, into whose service he had entered. It was rejected
by the former from ignorance, and by the latter with circum-
fiances most humiliating to a generous mind. By perseverance,
however, and address, he at length induced the molf wary and
least adventurous court in Europe to undertake the execution
of his plan; and Spain, as the reward of this deviation from
its usual cautious maxims, had the glory of discovering a new
world, hardly inferior in magnitude to a third part of the ha-
bitable globe. Aflonifhing as the fucccfs of Columbus was,
it did not fully accomplilh his own winfles, or conduc him to
thoie regions of the East, the expectation of reaching which
was the original object of his voyage. The effeCts, however,
of his diicovcrics were great and extensive. By giving Spain

and many valuable produAions of nature, several of which .
had hitherto been deemed peculiar to lIlia, wealth began to
flow so copiously into that kingdom, and thence was so diffused
over Europe, as gradually awakened a general spirit of in-
duftry, and called forth exertions, which alone must have soon
turned the course of commerce into new channels.

BUT this was accomplished more speedily, as well as more

completely, by the other great event which I mentioned, the
discovery of a new route of navigation to the EaR by the Cape
of Good Hope. When the Portuguele, to whom mankind
are indebted for opening this communication between the mos
remote parts of the habitable globe, undertook their tirf voyage
of discovery, it is probable that they had nothing farther in
view than to explore those parts of the coals of Africa which
lay nearest to their own country. But a spirit of enterprise,
when routed and put in motion, is always progrefnive; and
that of the Portuguele, though flow and timid in its firR ope-
rations, gradually acquired vigour, and prompted them to ad-
vance along the western shore of the African continent, far
beyond the utmost boundary of ancient navigation in that
dirction. Encouraged by success, it became more adventurous,
defpiled dangers which formerly appalled it, and surmounted
difficulties which it once deemed insuperable. When the
I'ortuguefe found in the torrid zone, which the ancients had
1,ronounccd to be uninhabitable, fertile countries, occupied by
numerous nations; and perceived that the continent of Africa,
i,lltcad of extending in breadth towards the Weft, according to

the

133

S E C T. the opinion of Ptolemy, appeared to contrac itself, and to bend
,_ a Eastwards, more extensive profpe&s opened to their view,

and inspired them vih hopes of reaching India, by continuing
to hold the fame course which they had so long pursued.

AFTER several unsuccessful attempts to accomplish what they

had in view, a small squadron failed from the Tagus, under the
command of Vasco de Gama, an officer of rank, whose abilities
and courage fitted him to conduct the most difficult and arduous
enterprises. From unacquaintance, however, with the proper
season and route of navigation in that vast ocean through
which he had to fieer his course, his voyage was long and
dangerous. At length he doubled that promontory, which, for
several years, had been the object of terror and of hope to his
countrymen. From that, after a prosperous navigation along
the south-east of Africa, he arrived at the city of Melinda,
and had the fatisfaelion of discovering there, as well as at
other places where he touched, people of a race very different
from the rude inhabitants of the Wefern fiore of that con-
tinent, which alone the Portuguese had hitherto visited. These
he found to be so far advanced in civilization, and acquaintance
with the various arts of life, that they carried on an active
commerce, not only with the nations on their own coast, but
with remote countries of Asia. Conduted by their pilots,
who held a course (with which experience had rendered them
well acquainted) he failed across the Indian ocean, and landed
at Calecut, on the coast of Malabar, on the twenty-fecond of
May, one thousand four hundred and ninety-eight, ten months
and two days after his departure from the port of Lisbon.

unexpected visit of an unknown people, whose aspect, and i
arms, and manners, bore no resemblance to any of the nations
accustomed to frequent his harbours, and who arrived in his
dominions by a route hitherto deemed impracticable, received
them, at first, with that fond admiration which is often excited
by novelty. But in a ihort time, as if he had been inspired
with foresight of all the calamities now approaching India by
this fatal communication opened with the inhabitants of Europe,
he formed various schemes to cut off Gama and his followers.
But from every danger to which he was exposed, either by the
open attacks or secret machination of the Indians, the Por-
tuguefe Admiral extricated himself with singular prudence and
intrepidity, and at last failed from Calccut with his ships loaded,
not only with the commodities peculiar to that coast, but with.
many of the rich producions of the Eastern parts of India.

ON his return to Liibon, he was received with the admira-

tion and gratitude due to a man, who, by his superior abilities
and resolution, had conducted to such an happy issue an under-
taking of the greatest importance, which had long occupied the
thoughts of his Sovereign, and excited the hopes of his fellow-
iubjets'. Nor did this event interclt the Portuguese alone.
No nation in Europe beheld it with unconcern. For although

S E C T. we contemplate its influence upon science by giving a more

-.- * ,complete knowledge of the globe which we inhabit, or whether

we confider its effects upon the commercial intercourse of man-
kind, be an event far more splendid than the voyage of Gama,
yet the latter seems originally to have excited more general
attention. The former, indeed, filled the minds of men with
aftonilhment; it was some time, however, before they attained
such a sufficient knowledge of that portion of the earth now
laid open to their view, as to form any just idea, oreven probable
conjecture, with refleQ& to what might be the consequences of
communication with it. But the immense value of the Indian
trade, which both in ancient and in modern times had enriched
every nation by which it was carried on, was a subjec fa-
miliar to the thoughts of all intelligent men, and they at once
perceived that the discovery of this new route of navigation to
the East, muff occasion great revolutions, not only in the course
of commerce, but in the political fiate of Europe.

WnAT there revolutions were most likely to be, and how

they would operate, were points examined with particular
attention in the cities of Lisbon and of Venice, but with feel-
ings very different. The Portuguese, founding upon the rights
to which, in that age, priority of discovery, confirmed by a
papal grant, were supposed to confer, deeming themselves in-
titled to an esclufive commerce with the countries which they
had first visited, began to enjoy, by anticipation, all the benefits
of it, and to fancy that their capital would soon be what Venice
then was, the great store-house of Eastem commodities to all
Europe, and the feat of opulence and power. On the first

6 intelligence
136

intelligence of Gama's successful voyage, the Venetians, with S E C T.
the quick-fighted discernment of merchants, foresaw the imme- .
diate consequence of it to be the ruin of that lucrative branch of
commerce which had contributed so greatly to enrich and aggran-
dize their country; and they observed this with more poignant
concern, as they were apprehensive that they did not possess any
effecual means of preventing, or even retarding, its operation.

THE hopes and fears of both were well founded. The

Portuguese entered upon the new career opened to them with
acivity and ardour, and made exertions, both commercial and
military, far beyond what could have been expe&ed from a
kingdom of such inconsiderable extent. All these were directed
by an intelligent monarch, capable of forming plans of the
greatest magnitude with calm systematic wisdom, and of pro-
fecuting them with unremitting perseverance. The prudence
and vigour of his measures, however, would have availed
little without proper inltruments to carry them into execution.
Happily for Portugal, the discerning eye of Emanuel fele&ted
a fucceflion of officers to take the supreme command in India,
who, by their enterprizing valour, military tkill, and political
sagacity, accompanied with difinterefied integrity, public spirit,
and love of their country, have a title to be ranked with the
persons molt eminent for virtue and abilities in any age or
nation. Greater things perhaps were atchieved by them, than
were ever accompli(hed in so short a time. Before the close of
lEmanuel's reign, twenty-four years only after the voyage of
Gama, the Portuguese had rendered themselves matlers of the
city of Malacca, in which the great staple of trade carried on

E C T. among the inhabitants of all those regions in Asia, which
I1.
_ __ . Europeans have diftinguifled by the general name of the East-

Indies, was then established. To this port, situated nearly at an
equal diltance from the Eastern and Western extremities of
these countries, and possessing the command of that strait, by
which they keep communication with each other, the mer-
chants of China, of Japan, of every kingdom on the con-
tinent, of the Moluccas and all the islands in the Archipelago,
resorted from the East; and those of Malabar, of Ceylon, of
Coromandel, and of Bengal, from the Weft'. This conquest
fccured to the Portuguese great influence over the interior
commerce of India, while, at the fame time, by their fettle-
ments at Goa and Diu, they were enabled to engross the trade
of the Malabar coast, and to obftru& greatly the long efta-
blifled intercourse of Egypt with India by the Red Sea.
Their ships frequented every port in the EaR where valuable
commodities were to be found, from the Cape of Good Hope
to the river of Canton; and along this immense stretch of
coast, extending upwards of four thousand leagues ;, they had
eftablilhed, for the conveniency or protection of trade, a chain
of forts or factories. They had likewile taken poegfflon of
flations most favourable to commerce along the Southern coast
of Africa, and in many of the islands which lie between
tladagafcar and the Moluccas. In every part of the East
they were received with refpeet, in many they had acquired
the absolute command. They carried on trade there without

their mutual intercourse; they often set what price they pleased
on the goods which they purchased; and were thus enabled to
import from Indoftan and the regions beyond it, whatever is
useful, rare, or agreeable, in greater abundance, and of more
various kinds, than had been known formerly in Europe.

NOT satisfied with this ascendant which they had acquired

in India, the Portuguese early formed a scheme, no less bold
than interested, of excluding all other nations from partici-
pating of the advantages of commerce with the Eaf. In
order to effec this, it was necessary to obtain pofleffion of such
stations in the Arabian and Persian Gulfs, as might render
them maiters of the navigation of these two inland leas, and
enable them both to obftru& the ancient commercial inter-
course between Egypt and India, and to command the entrance
of the great rivers, which facilitated the conveyance of Indian
goods, not only through the interior provinces of Asia, but
as far as Constantinople. The conduc of the measures for
this purpose was committed to Alphonfo Albuquerque, the
most eminent of all the Portuguese generals who diftinguilh-
ed themselves in India. After the utmost efforts of genius and
valour, he was able to accomplish one-half only of what the
ambition of his countrymen had planned. By wresting the
island of Ormus, which commanded the mouth of the Persian
Gulf, from the petty princes, who, as tributaries to the mo-
narchs of Persia, had established their dominion there, he
secured to Portugal that extensive trade with the East, which
(as I have formerly described) the Persians had carried on for

I39
T 2

fevcral

S EC T. several centuries. In the hands of the Portuguese, Ormuz

Il!.
i-- soon became the great mart from which the Persian empire,

and all the provinces of Asia to the weft of it, were supplied
with the producions of India; and a city which they built on
that barren island, defitute of water, was rendered one of the
chief feats of opulence, splendour, and luxury in the Eastern
world i.

THE operations of Albuquerque in the Red Sea were far

from being attended with equal success. Partly by the vigor-
ous resistance of the Arabian princes, whose ports he attacked,
and partly by the damage his fleet sustained in a sea of
which the navigation is remarkably diflicult and dangerous,
he was conflrained to retire, without effeQing any settlement
of importance . The ancient channel of intercourse with
India by the Red Sea still continued open to the Egyptians;
but their commercial tranfadions in that country were greatly
circumscribed and obftruded, by the influence which the Por-
tuguefe had acquired in every port to which they were accuf-
tomed to resort.

IN consequence of this, the Venetians soon began to feel

that decrease of their own Indian trade which they had fore-
seen and dreaded. In order to prevent the farther progress of
this evil, they persuaded the Soldan of the Mamcluks, equally

in the East, and no less interested to hinder them from en-
grossing that commerce, which had so long been the chief
source of opulence both to the monarchs and to the people
of Egypt, to enter into a negociation with the Pope and the
King of Portugal. The tone which the Soldan assumed in
this negociation was such as became the fierce chief of a
military government. After fating his exclusive right to
the trade with India, he forewarned Julius II. and Emanuel,
that, if the Portuguese did not relinquish that new courle of
navigation by which they had penetrated into the Indian oceans
and cease from encroaching on that commerce, which from
time immemorial had been carried on between the East
of Asia and his dominions, he would put to death all the
christians in Egypt, Syria, and Palefline, burn their churches,
and demolish the holy sepulchre itself k. This formidable
threat, which, a few centuries before this period, would have
made all Chriflendom tremble, seems to have made bs little
impreflion, that the Vcnctians, as the last expedient, had re-
course to a measure, which, in that age, was deemed not
only reprehensible, but impious. They incited the Soldan to
fit out a fleet in the Red Sea, and to attack those unexpeced
invaders of a gainful monopoly, of which he and his pre-
deceffors had long enjoyed undiflurbed poffeflion. As Egypt
did not produce timber proper for building lhips of force,
the Venetians permitted the Soldan to cut it in their forests
of Dalmatia, whence it was conveyed to Alexandria, and

. , There twelve ihips of war were built, on board of which a

body of Mameluks was ordered to serve, under the command
of an officer of merit. These new enemies, far more for-
midable than the natives of India with whom the Portuguese
had hitherto contended, they encountered, with undaunted
courage, and after some severe conflics, they entirely ruined
the squadron, and remained masters of the Indian ocean'.

SOON after this disaster, the dominion of the Mameluks

was overturned, and Egypt, Syria, and Palestine were sub-
je&ed to the Turkish empire by the victorious arms of Selim I.
Their mutual interest quickly induced the Turks and Vene-
tians to forget ancient animofities, and to co-operate to-
wards the ruin of the Portuguese trade in India. With this
view Selim confirmed to the Venetians the extensive com-
mercial privileges which they had enjoyed under the govern-
ment of the Mameluks, and published an edift permitting
the free entry of all the producions of the Eaf, imported
direcly from Alexandria, into every part of his dominions,
and imposing heavy duties upon such as were brought
from Lisbon '.

BUT all there were unavailing efforts against the superior

advantages which the Portuguese possessed, in supplying
Europe with the commodities of the East, in consequence

of having opened a new mode of communication with it. S E C T.
At the fame time, the Venetians, brought to the brink of .
ruin by the fatal league of Cambray, which broke the power
and humbled the pride of the republic, were incapable of
such efforts for the preservation of their commerce, as they
might have made in the more vigorous age of their govern-
ment, and were reduced to the feeble expedients of a de-
clining state. Of this there is a remarkable instance in an
offer made by them to the King of Portugal in the year one
thousand five hundred and twenty-one, to purchase, at a fipu-
lated price, all the spices imported into Lisbon, over and
above what might be requisite for the consumption of
his own fubjets. If Emanuel had been so inconsiderate
as to close with this proposal, Venice would have recovered
all the benefit of the gainful monopoly which she had loft.
But the offer met with the reception that it merited, and
was rejeted without hesitation".

THE Portuguese, almoR without obftrudion, continued

their progress in the East, until they eftablilhed there a
commercial empire; to which, whether we confider its ex-
tent, its opulence, the slender power by which it was formed,
or the splendour with which the government of it was
conducted, there had hitherto been nothing comparable in the
history of nations. Emanuel, who laid the foundation of this
stupendous fabric, had the fatisfa&ion to fee it almost completed.
Every part of Europe was supplied by the Portuguese with the
producions of the Eaf; and if we except some inconsiderable

quantity

143

S ElC T. quantity of them, which the Venetians still continued to re-
._ _i. ceive by the ancient channels of conveyance, our quarter of

the globe had no longer any commercial intercourse with
India, and the regions of Asia beyond it, but by the Cape of
Good Hope.

THOUGH from this period the people of Europe have con-

tinued to carry on their trade with India by sea, yet a con-
fiderable portion of the valual; e productions of the East is
fill conveyed to other regions of the earth by land-carriage.
In tracing the progress of trade with India, this branch of it
is an objec of considerable magnitude, which has not been
examined with sufficient attention. That the ancients ihould
have had recourse frequently to the tedious and expensve
mode of transporting goods by land, will not appear surprising,
when we recollect the imperfect state of navigation among
them: The reason of this mode of conveyance being not only
continued, but increased, in modern times, demands some ex-
planation.

IF we infpet a map of Asia, we cannot fail to observe,

that the communication throughout all the countries of that
great continent to the well of Indoftan and China, though
opened in some degree towards the south by the navigable
rivers Euphrates and Tigris, and towards the north by two
inland seas, the Euxine and Caspian, must be carried on in
many extensive proiinces wholly by land. This, as I have
obfenred, was the firlt mode of intercourse between different
countries, and during the infancy of navigation it was the

2 only
144

only one. Even after that art had attained some degree of S E C T.
improvement, the conveyance of goods by the two rivers ·
which I have mentioned, extended so little way into the
interior country, and the trade of the Euxine and Caspian
seas was so often obftruted by the barbarous nations scat-
tered along their 1hores, that, partly on that account, and
partly from the adherence of mankind to ancient habits, the
commerce of the various provinces of Asia, particularly that
with India and the regions beyond it, continued to be con-
du&ed by land.

THE fame circumRances which induced the inhabitants of

Asia to carry on such a considerable part of their commerce
with each other in this manner, operated with still more
powerful effec in Africa. That vail continent, which little
resembles the other divisions of the earth, is not penetrated by
inland seas, like Europe and Asia, or by a chain of lakes, like
North America, or opened by rivers (the Nile alone excepted)
of extended navigation. It forms one uniform, continuous fur-
face, between the various parts of which there could be no inter-
course, from the earliest times, but by land. Rude as all the
people o^Africa are, and slender as the progress is which they
have made in the arts of life, such a communication appears
to have been always kept up. How far it extended in the
more early periods to which I have direted my researches, and
by what different routes it was carried on, I have not sufficient
information to determine with accuracy. It is highly probable
that, from time immemorial, the gold, the ivory, the perfumes,
both of the southern parts of Africa, and of its more northern

U difrits,

14S

S E C T. diirits, were conveyed either to the Arabian Gulf, or to
v__- . Egypt, and exchanged for the spices and other producions

of the Eat.

THE Mahomedan religion, which spread with amazing

rapidity over all Asia and a considerable part of Africa,
contributed greatly towards the increase of commercial in-
tercourfe by land in both these quarters of the globe, and
has given it additional vigour, by mingling with it a new
principle of ativity, and by directing it to a common cen-
tre. Mahomet enjoined all his followers to visit once in
their life-time, the Caaba or square building in the temple
of Mecca, the immemorial objeCf of veneration among
his countrymen; and, according to their tradition, the first
spot on this earth which was consecrated to the worship of
God: In order to preserve continually upon their minds a
sense of their obligation to perform this duty, he directed
that, in all the multiplied ats of devotion which his re-
ligion prescribes, true believers fiould always turn their faces
towards that holy place °. In obedience to a precept solemnly
enjoined and sedulously inculcated, numerous caravans of pil-
grims afremble annually in every country where the Jlahome-
dan faith is eRablifhed. From the mhores of the Atlantic on
one hand, and from the most remote regions of the East on
the other, the votaries of the Prophet advance to Mecca.
Commercial ideas and objecs mingle with those of devotion.
The numerous camels of each caravan are loaded with those

commodities of every country which are of easiest carriage S E1 T.
and most ready sale. The holy city is crowded, not only .
with zealous devotees, but with opulent merchants. During
the few days they remain there, the fair of Mecca is the
greatest, perhaps, on the face of the earth. Mercantile tranf-
aftions are carried on in it to an immense value, of which the
dispatch, the silence, the mutual confidence and good faith in
conducting them, are the most unequivocal proof. The pro-
ductions and manufactures of India form a capital article in this
great traffic, and the caravans, on their return, disseminate them
through every part of Asia and Africa. Some of there are
deemed neceflary, not only to the comfort, but to the prefer-
vation of life, and others contribute to its elegance and plea-
sure. They are so various as to suit the tafe of mankind in
every climate, and in different stages of improvement; and
are in high request among the rude natives of Africa, as
well as the more luxurious inhabitants of Asia. In order to
supply their several demands, the caravans return loaded with
the muslins and chintzes of Bengal and the Deccan, the
shawls of Cachemire, the pepper of Malabar, the diamonds
of Golconda, the pearls of Kilkare, the cinnamon of Ceylon,
the nutmeg cloves and mace of the Moluccas, and an immense
number of other Indian commodities.

BESIDE these great caravans, formed partly by respect for a

religious precept, and partly with a view to extend a lucrative
branch of commerce, there are other caravans, and there not
inconsiderable, composed entirely of merchants, who have no ob-
jeEt but trade. These, at stated seasons, set out from different parts

Indoftan, and even to China, by routes which were anciently
known, they convey by land-carriage the most valuable com-
modities of there countries to the remote provinces of both
empires. It is only by confidering the distance to which large
quantities of these commodities are carried, and frequently
across extensive deserts, which, without the aid of camels,
would have been impassable, that we can form any idea of
the magnitude of the trade with India by land, and are led to
perceive, that in a Disquisition concerning the various modes
of conducting this commerce, it is well entitled to the attention
which I have bestowed in endeavouring to trace it q.

in which history affords any authentic information concerning it,
until an entire revolution was made in its nature, and the mod.

public attention; as we have now reached that point whence
a line may be drawn which marks the chief diftination between
the manners and political inflitutions of ancient and modern
times, it will render the work more inftruaive and useful, to
conclude it with some general observations, which naturally arise
from a furvcy of both, and a comparison of the one with the
other. These observations, I trust, will be found, not only to
have an intimate conoetion with the fubjcta of my researches,
and to throw additional light upon it; but will serve to
illustrate many particulars in the general history of commerce,
and to point out effecs or consequences of various events,
which have not been generally observed, or confidered with
that attention which they merited.

I. AFTER viewing the great and extensive effects of finding a

new courfc of navigation to India by the Cape of Good Hope,
it may appear surprising to a modern observer, that a discovery
of such importance was not made, or even attempted, by any
of the commercial fates of the ancient world. But in judg-
ing with refped to the conduct of nations in remote times, we
never err more widely, than when we decide with regard to
it, not according to the ideas and views of their age, but of
our own. This is not, perhaps, more conspicuous in any
instance, than in that under consideration. It was by the
Tyrians, and by the Greeks, who were maflers of Egypt, that

the

producions of the East. From the account that has been .
given of the manner in which they procured there, it is
manifest that they had neither the fame inducements with mo-
dern nations to wish for any new communication with India,
nor the fame means of accomplishing it. All the commercial
tranfaaions of the ancients with the EaR were confined to the
ports on the Malabar coast, or extended at farthest to the ifand
of Ceylon. To these staples, the natives of all the different
regions in the eafern parts of Asia brought the commodities
which were the growth of their several countries, or the pro-
duc of their ingenuity, in their own vessels, and with them
the ships from Tyre and from Egypt completed their invest-
ments. While the operations of their Indian trade were carried
on within a sphere so circumscribed, the conveyance of a
cargo by the Arabian Gulf, notwithstanding the expence of
land-carriage, either from Elath to Rhinocolura, or across the
defart to the Nile, was so safe and commodious, that the
merchants of Tyre and Alexandria had little reason to be so-
licitous for the discovery of any other. The situation of both
there cities, as well as that of the other considerable commercial
states of antiquity, was very different from that of the coun-
tries to which, in later times, mankind have been indebted
for keeping up intercourse with the remote parts of the globe.
Portugal, Spain, England, Holland, which have been molt
active and successful in this line of enterprise, all lie on the
Atlantic ocean, (in which every European voyage of discovery
must commence,) or have immediate access to it. But Tyre
was situated at the eaRtern extremity of the Mediterranean,

Alexandria

x5z

S E C T. Alexandria not far from it; Rhodes, Athens, Corinth, which

IV.
, came afterwards to be ranked among the most active trading

cities of antiquity, lay considerably advanced towards the fame
quarter in that sea. The commerce of all these states was
long confined within the precinas of the Mediterranean; and
in some of them never extended beyond it. The pillars
of Hercules, or the Straits of Gibraltar, were long confidered
as the utmof boundary of navigation. To reach this was
deemed a signal proof of naval flill; and before any of these
Rates could give a beginning to an attempt towards exploring
the valf unknown ocean which lay beyond it, they had to ac-
complifh a voyage (according to their ideas) of great extent
and much danger. This was sufficient to deter them from
engaging in an arduous undertaking, from which, even if
attended with success, their situation prevented their entertaining
hopes of deriving great advantage '.

BUT could we suppose the discovery of a new paifage to

India to have become an obje& of desire or pursuit to any
of there Rates, their science as well as pracice of navigation
was so defetive, that it would have been hardly possible
for them to attain it. The veftels which the ancients em-
ployed in trade were so small, as not to afford stowage for
provisions sufficient to subsist a crew during a long voyage.
Their confirucion was such that they could seldom venture
to depart far from land, and their mode of fleering along
the coast (which I have been obliged to mention often) so
circuitous and flow, that from there as well as from other

circumstances which I might have specified b, we may pro- s E c T.
nounce a voyage from the Mediterranean to India by the
Cape of Good Hope, to have been an undertaking beyond
their power to accomplish, in such a manner as to render
it, in any degree, subservient to commerce. To this decision,
the account preserved by Herodotus, of a voyage performed
by some Phenician ships employed by a king of Egypt,
which, taking their departure fiom the Arabian Gulf, doubled
the Southern promontory of Africa, and arrived, at the end
of three years, by the Straits of Gades, or Gibraltar, at the
mouth of the Nile', can hardly be confidered as repugnant;
for several writers of the greatest eminence among the ancients,
and most diftinguilhed for their proficiency in the knowlege of
geography, regarded this account rather as an amusing tale,
than the history of a real tranfadion; and either entertained
doubts concerning the possibility of failing round Africa, or
absolutely denied itd. But if what Herodotus relates concern-
ing the course held by these Phenician ships had ever been
received by the ancients with general assent, we can hardly sup-
pose, that any state could have been so wildly adventurous, as to
imagine that a voyage, which it required three years to complete,
could be undertaken with a profpe& of commercial benefit.

S E C T. they early acquired there, mark such a diRintion between

IV.
t _', their mode of conduting naval operations, and that of the

ancients, as merits to be confidered and explained with at-
tention. From the reign of the first Ptolemy, to the conquest
of Egypt by the Mahomedans, Europe had been supplied with
the producions of the East by the Greeks of Alexandria,
by the Romans while they were matiers of Egypt, and by
the fubjeas of the Emperors of Constantinople, when that
kingdom became a province of their dominions. During
this long period, extending almost to a thousand years, none
of those people, the most enlightened, undoubtedly, in the
ancient world, ever advanced by sea farther towards the East
than the Gulf of Siam, and had no regular established trade
but with the ports on the coast of Malabar, or those in
the island of Ceylon. They attempted no conquests in
any part of India, they made no settlements, they erected
no forts. Satisfied with an intercourse merely commercial,
they did not aim at acquiring any degree of power or do-
minion in the countries where they traded, though it seems
to be probable that they might have established it without
much opposition from the natives, a gentle effeminate peo-
ple, with whom, at that time, no foreign and more warlike
race was mingled. But the enterprizing aaivity of the Por-
tuguefe was not long confined within the fame limits; a few
years after their arrival at Calecut, they advanced towards the
East, into regions unknown to the ancients. The kingdoms
of Cambodia, Cochin China, Tonquin, the vafR empire of
China, and all the fertile islands in the great Indian Archi-
pelago, from Sumatra to the Philippines, were discovered, and

the Portuguese, though opposed in every quarter by the S E C T.

IV.

Mahomedans of Tartar or Arabian origin fettled in many .
parts of India, enemies much more formidable than the
natives, efablilhed there that extensive influence and domi-
nion which I have formerly described.

OF this remarkable difference between the progress and

operations of the ancients and moderns in India, the im.
perfet knowlege of the former, with refpe& both to the
theory and practice of navigation, seems to have been the
principal cause. From the coast of Malabar to the Philip-
pines, was a voyage of an extent far beyond any that the
ancients were accustomed to undertake, and, according to
their manner of failing, must have required a great length
of time to perform it. The nature of their trade with
India was such, that they had not (as I have already ob-
served) the fame inducements with the moderns, to prose-
cute discovery with ardour; and, according to the defcrip-
tion given of the vessels in which the merchants of Alex-
andria carried on their trade from the Arabian Gulf, they
appear to have been very unfit for that purpose. On
all these accounts, the ancients remained satisfied with a
(lender knowlege of India; and influenced by reasons pro.
ceeding from the fame cause, they attempted neither con-
quest nor settlement there. In order to accomplish either
of there, they must have transported a considerable numbler
of men from India. But, from the defec'ive flruture of
their flhips, as well as from the imperfection of their art in

X 2 navigating

15S

S E C T. navigating them, the ancients seldom ventured to convey a
___.. body of troops to any distance by sea. From Berenice to

AMuiris, was to them, even after Hippalus had discovered
the miethod of steering a direc course, and when their naval
Pkill had attained to its highest fate of improvement, a voy-
age of no less than seventy days. By the ancient route
along the coast of Perlia, a voyage from the Arabian Gulf
to any part of India must have been of greater length, and
accomplished more slowly. As no hostile attack was ever
made upon India by sea, either by the Greek monarchs of
Egypt, though the two first of them were able and ambi-
tious Princes, or by the most enterprizing of the Roman
Emperors, it is evident that they must have deemed it an
attempt beyond their power to execute. Alexander the
Great, and, in imitation of him, his successors, the monarchs
of Syria, were the only persons in the ancient world who
formed an idea of establishing their dominion in any part
of India; but it was with armies led thither by land, that
'hey hoped to atchieve this.

III. THE sudden effect of opening a direc communication
ilth the East, in lowering the price of Indian commodities,

is a circumstance that merits observation. How compendious
loever the ancient intercourse with India may appear to
have been, it was attended with considerable expence. The
productions of the remote parts of Asia, brought to Ceylon,
or the ports on the Malabar coast, by the natives, were put
on board the {hips which arrived from the Arabian Gulf.
At Berenice they were landed, and carried by camels two

hundred
156

hundred and fifty-eight miles to the banks of the Nile. S E C T.

1V.

There they were again embarked, and conveyed down the -_
river to Alexandria, whence they were dispatched to different
markets. The addition to the price of goods by such a mul-
tiplicity of operations muff have been considerable, especially
when the rate chargeable on each operation was fixed by
monopolies, subjea to no controul. But after the passage to
India by the Cape of Good Hope was discovered, its va-
rious commodities were purchased at first hand in the countries
of which they were the growth or manufacture. In all these,
particularly in Indoftan and in China, the subsistence of man
is more abundant than in any other part of the earth. The
people live chiefly upon rice, the most prolific of all grains.
Population, of consequence, is so great, and labour so extremely
cheap, that every producion of nature or of art is fold at a
very low price. When these were shipped in different parts
of India, they were conveyed directly to Lisbon, by a naviga-
tion, long indeed, but uninterrupted and safe, and thence
circulated through Europe. The carriage of mercantile goods
by water is so much le's expensive than by any other mode
of conveyance, that as soon as the Portuguese could import
the productions of India in fuficicnt quantities to supply the
demands of Europe, they were able to afford them at such a
reduced price, that the competition of the Venetians ceased
almost entirely, and the full fiream of commerce flowed in
its natural direcion towards the cheapest market. In what
proportion the Portugucfe lowered the price of Indian com-
modities, I cannot ascertain with precision, as I have not found
in contemporary writers fufiicient information with refpeat

'57
o10

to

S E C T. to that point. Some idea, however, of this, approaching

IV.

_ perhaps near to accuracy, may be formed, from the computa-

tions of Mr. Munn, an intelligent Englifl merchant. He has
publilhed a table of the prices paid for various articles of goods
in India, compared with the prices for which they were fold in
Aleppo, from which the difference appears to be nearly as three
to one; and he calculates, that, after a reasonable allowance for
the expence of the voyage from India, the fame goods may be fold
in England at half the price which they bear in Aleppo. The
expence of conveying the productions of India up the Persian
Gulf to Baffora, and thence either through the Great or Little
Dcfert to Aleppo, could not, I ihould imagine, differ confider-
ably from that by the Red Sea to Alexandria. We may there-
fore suppose, that the Venetians might purchase them from the
merchants of that city, at nearly the fame rate for which they
were fold in Aleppo; and when we add to this, what they
must have charged as their own profit in all the markets which
they frequented, it is evident that the Portuguese might afford
to reduce the commodities of the East to a price below that
which -I have mentioned, and might supply every part of
Europe with them more than one-half cheaper than formerly.
The enterprizing schemes of the Portuguese monarchs were
accomplilhed sooner, as well as more completely, than in the
hour of most sanguine hope they could have presumed to expeCt;
and early in the sixteenth century, their fubjeas became possessed
of a monopoly of the trade with India, founded upon the
only equitable title, that of furnishing its produlions in greater
abundance, and at a more moderate price.

IV. WE
15g

IV. WE may observe, that in consequence of a more plen- S E C T.

IV.

tiful supply of Indian goods, and at a cheaper rate, the demand
for them increased rapidly in every part of Europe. To trace
the progress of this in detail, would lead me far beyond the
period which I have fixed as the limit of this Disquisition,
but some general remarks concerning it will be found intimately
conneced with the fubje& of my inquiries. What were the
chief articles of importation from India, while the Romans
had the direction of the trade with that country, I have for-
merly mentioned. But upon the subversion of their empire,
and the settlement of the fierce warriors of Scythia and Ger-
many in the various countries of Europe, the state of society,
as well as the condition of individuals, became so extremely
different, that the wants and desires of men were no longer the
fame. Barbarians, many of them not far advanced in their
progress beyond the rudest Rate of social life, had little relilh
for those accommodations, and that elegance, which are so
alluring to polilhed nations. The curious manufactures of
silk, the precious flones and pearls of the East, which had
been the ornament and pride of the wealthy and luxurious
citizens of Rome, were not objets of desire to men, who,.
for a considerable time after they took poffeflion of their new
conquests, retained the original simplicity of their pastoral
manners. They advanced, however, from rudeness to refine-
ment in the usual course of progreflion which nations are
destined to hold, and an increase of wants and desires requir-
ing new objeCts to gratify them, they began to acquire a
rclilh for iome of the luxuries of India. Among there they
had a lingular predilection for the fpiccries and aromatics

which;

159

S E 1'. which that country yields in such variety and abundance.

IV.
- . _Whence their peculiar fondness for these arose, it is not of

importance to inquire. Whoever peruses the writers of the
middle ages, vill find many particulars which confirm this
observation. In every enumeration of Indian commodities
which they give, spices are always mentioned as the most
considerable and precious article '. In their cookery, all dishes
were highly seasoned with them. In every entertainment of
parade, a profusion of them was deemed essential to mag-
nificence. In every medical prescription they were principal
ingredients'. But considerable as the demand for spices had
become, the mode in which the nations of Europe had hitherto
been supplied with them was extremely disadvantageous. The
hiips employed by the merchants of Alexandria never ven-
tured to visit those remote regions which produce the most
valuable spices, and before they could be circulated through
Europe, they were loaded with the accumulated profits received
by four or five different hands through which they had pafied.
But the Ponuguefe, with a bolder spirit of navigation, having
penetrated into every part of Asia, took in their cargo of spices
in the places where they grew, and could afford to dispose of
them at such a price, that, from being an expensive luxury,
they became an article of such general use, as greatly aug-
mented the demand for them. An effect similar to this may

imported from India, upon the reduion of their price by the .
Portuguese. From that period a growing taste for Asiatic lux-
uries may be traced in every country of Europe, and the num-
ber of ihips fitted out for that trade at Lisbon, continued to
increase every year*.

V. LUCRATIVE as the trade with India was, and had long

been deemed, it is remarkable that the Portuguese were sus-
sered to remain in the undiRurbed and exdufive poffellion of
it, during the course of almot a century. In the ancient
world, though Alexandria, from the peculiar felicity of its
situation, could carry on an intercourse with the EaR by sea,
and circulate its productions through Europe with such advan-
tage, as gave it a decided superiority over every rival; yet
various attempts (which I have described in their proper places)
were made, from time to time, to obtain some share in a com-
merce so apparently beneficial. From the growing a&ivity of
the commercial spirit in the sixteenth century, as well as from
the example of the eager Iolicitude with which the Venetians
and Genoese exerted themselves alternately to ihut out each
other from any share in the Indian trade, it might have been
expeted that some competitor would have arisen to call in
question the claim of the Portuguese to an exclusive right of
traffic with the East, and to wrest from them some portion of
it. There were, however, at that time, some peculiar circum-
stances in the political state of all those nations in Europe,

S E C T. whose intrusion, as rivals, the Portuguese had any reason to

monopoly of Indian commerce, during such a long period.
From the acceflion of Charles V. to the throne, Spain was
either so much occupied in a multiplicity of operations in
which it was engaged by the ambition of that monarch, and
of his son Philip II. or so intent on prosecuting its own dif-
coveries and conquests in the New World, that, although, by
A.D. 1511. the successful enterprize of Magellan, its fleets were unexpeat-

edly conduaed by a new courfie to that remote region of Alia
which was the feat of the molf gainful and alluring branch of
trade carried on by the Portuguese, it could make no confider-
able effort to avail itself of the commercial advantages which
it might have derived from that event. By the acquisition of
the crown of Portugal, in the year one thousand five hundred
and eighty, the kings of Spain, inflead of the rivals, became
the protecors of the Portuguese trade, and the guardians of
all its extensive rights. Throughout the sixteenth century,
the strength and resources of France were so much wafted by
the fruitless expeditions of their monarchs into Italy, by their
unequal conteR with the power and policy of Charles V. and
by the calamities of the civil wars which desolated the king-
dom upwards of forty years, that it could neither bestow much
attention upon objects of commerce, nor engage in any scheme
of diltant enterprize. The Venetians, how sensibly soever
they might feel the mortifying reverie of being excluded,
almost entirely, from the Indian trade, of which their capital
had been formerly the chief feat, were so debilitated and
humbled by the League of Cambray, that they were no longer

capable

capable of engaging in any undertaking of magnitude. Eng- S E C T.

land, weakened (as I formerly observed) by the long contest
between the houses of York and Lancaster, and just beginning
to recover its proper vigour, was restrained from ascive exer-
tion, during one part of the sixteenth century, by the cautious
maxims of Henry VII. and wafted its strength, during another
part of it, by engaging inconsiderately in the wars between
the princes on the continent. The nation, though destined to
acquire territories in India more extensive and valuable than
were ever pofleffed by any European power, had no such pre-
sentiment of its future eminence there, as to take an early part
in the commerce or tranfatlions of that country, and a great
part of the century elapsed before it began to turn its attention
towards the East.

WHILE the molt considerable nations in Europe found it

necessary, from the circumstances which I have mentioned,
to remain ina&ive spectators of what passed in the East, the
Seven United Provinces of the Low Countries, recently formed
into a small state, still struggling for political existence, and yet
in the infancy of its power, ventured to appear in the Indian
ocean as the rivals of the Portuguese; and, despising their
pretensions to an exclusive right of commerce with the exten-
five countries to the eastward of the Cape of Good Hope,
invaded that monopoly which they had hitherto guarded with
such jealous attention. The Englilh soon followed the exam-
ple of the Dutch, and both nations, at first by the enterprizing
industry of private adventurers, and afterwards by the more
powerful efforts of trading companies, under the prote&tion of

Y 2 public

S E C T. public authority, advanced with aflonithing ardour and fuccef

Av. ' _, in this new career opened to them. The vaRf fabric of power

which the Portuguese had ereeted in the EaR (a fuperftruture
much too large for the basis en which it had to red) was
almost entirely overturned, in as (hort time, and with as much
facility, as it had been raised. England and Holland, by driv-
ing them from their mors valuable settlements, and seizing the
moR lucrative branches of their trade, have attained to that pre-
eminence in naval power and commercial opulence, by which
they are diftingui&ed among the nations of Europe.

VI. TaH co-incidence, in point of time, of the diftoveries

made by Columbus in the Welt, and those of Gama in the
Eaf, is a singular circumstance, which merits observation, on
account of the remarkable influence of those events in forming
or strengthening the commercial connecion of the different
quarters of the globe with each other. In all ages, gold and
silver, particularly the latter, have been the commodities ex-
ported with the greatest profit to India. In no part of the
earth do the natives depend so little upon foreign countries,
either for the necessaries or luxuries of life. The blessings of
a favourable climate and fertile foil, augmented by their own
ingenuity, afford them whatever they desire. In consequence
of this, trade with them has always been carried on in one
uniform manner, and the precious metals have been given in
exchange for their peculiar productions, whether of nature or
art. But when the communication with India was rendered
so much more easy, that the demand for its commodities began
to increaie far beyond what had been formerly known, if

Europe

16s

Europe had not been supplied with the gold and silver which S E C T.
it was neceflary to carry to the markets of the Ealt from i
sources richer and more abundant than her own barren and
impoverifled mines, ihe mull either have abandoned the trade
with India altogether, or have continued it with manifest' di!-
advantage; By such a continual drain of gold and silver, as
well as by the unavoidable waste of both in circulation and in
manufacures, the quantity of those metals must have gone on
diminishing, and their value would have been so much en-
hanced, that they could not have continued long to be of the
fame utility in the commercial tranfaifons between the two
countries. But before the effecs of this diminution could be
very sensibly felt, America opened her mines, and poured in
treasures upon Europe in the most copious itream to which
mankind ever had access. This treasure, in spite of innume-
rable anxious precautions to prevent it, flowed to the markets
where the commodities necessary for filpplying the wants, or
gratifying the luxury of the Spaniards, were to be found; and
from that time to the present, the Englilh and Dutch have
purchased the producions of China and Indoftan, with silver.
brought from the mines of Mexico and Peru. The immense
exportation of silver to the Eall, during the course of two
centuries, has not only been replaced by the continual influx
from America, but the quantity of it has been considerably
augmented, and at the fame time the proportional rate of its
value in Europe and in India has varied so little, that it is
chiefly with silver that many of the capital articles imported
from the Eat are Rfill purchased.

WHILE America contributed in this manner to facilitate and
extend the intercourse of Europe with Asia, it gave rife to a

traffic

S E C T. traffic with Africa, which, from slender beginnings, has he-

V. *. come so considerable, as to form the chief bond of commercial

connetion with that continent. Soon after the Portuguese had
extended their discoveries on the coast of Africa beyond the
river Senegal, they endeavoured to derive some benefit from
their new settlements there, by the ale of saves. Various
circumstances combined in favouring the revival of this odious
traffic. In every part of America, of which the Spaniards
took poffefflon, they found that the natives, from the feeble-
ness of their frame, from their indolence, or from the in-
judicious manner of treating them, were incapable of the
exertions requisite either for working mines, or for cultivating
the earth. Eager tofind hands more indultrious and efficient,
the Spaniards had recourse to their neighbours the Portuguese,
and purchased from them negroe slaves. Experience soon dif-
covered, that they were men of a more hardy race, and so
much better fitted for enduring fatigue, that the labour of one
negroe was computed to be equal to that of four Americans b;
and from that time the number employed in the New World
has gone on increasing with rapid progress. In this practice,
no lets repugnant to the feelings of humanity than to the
principles of religion, the Spaniards have unhappily been imi-
tated by all the nations of Europe, who have acquired territo-
ries in the warmer climates of the New World. At present
the number of negroe raves in the settlements of Great Britain
and France in the Weft Indies, exceeds a million; and as the
establishment of servitude has been found, both in ancient and
in modern times, extremely unfavourable to population, it re-

tboufand, to keep up the stock . If it were possible to ascertain, .
with equal exadnefs, the number of slaves in the Spanish do-
minions, and in North America, the total number of negroe
slaves might be well reckoned at as many more.

Tnus the commercial genius of Europe, which has given

it a visible ascendent over the three other divisions of the
earth, by discerning their refpedive wants and resources, and
by rendering them reciprocally subservient to one another,
has eftablified an union among them, from which it has
derived an immense increase of opulence, of power, and of
enjoyments.

VII. THOUGH the discovery of a New World in the Well,

and the opening of a more easy and diret communication
with the remote regions of the East, co-operated towards ex-
tending the commerce, and adding to the enjoyments, of
Europe, a remarkable difference may be observed, with refpe6t
both to the time and the manner in which they produced these
cffeds. When the Portuguese first visited the different countries
of Asia, stretching from the coafl of Malabar to China, they
found them polfeiNed by nations highly civilized, which had
made considerable progress in elegant as well as ufefiul arts,
which were accultomed to intercourse with firangers, and well
acquainted with all the advantages of commerce. But when
the Spaniards began to explore the New World which they

S E C T. discovered, the afpe: which it presented to them Was very

_ different. The islands were inhabited by naked avages, so

unacquainted with the simples and most necessary arts of life,
that they subsisted chiefly an the spontaneous productions of a
fertile foil and genial climate. The continent appeared to be a
forest of immense extent, along the coast of which were scat-
tered ofme feeble tribes, not greatly superior to the islanders in
industry or improvement. Even its two large monarchies,
which have been dignified with the appellation of civilized
states, had not advanced so far beyond their countrymen, as
to be entitled to that name. The inhabitants, both of Mexico
and Peru, unacquainted with the useful metals, and destitute
of the address requisite for acquiring such command of the
inferior animals as to derive any aid from their labour, had
made so little progrefi in agriculture, the first of all arts, that
one of the greatest difficulties with which the small number of
Spaniards, who overturned those empires which have been so
highly extolled, had to struggle, was howto procure in them
what was fuffcient for their subsistence.

IT was of consequence, with a very different spirit, that

the intercourse with two countries, resembling each other so
little in their degree of improvement, was begun and carried
on. The Portuguese, certain of finding in the East, not only
the productions with which the bountiful hand of Nature has
enriched that part of the globe, but various manufatures
which had long been known and admired in Europe, engaged
in this alluring trade with the greatest eagerness. The encou-
ragement of it their monarchs confidered as a chief objed of
government, towards which they direaed all the power of the

IV.

in the prosecution of it, as occasioned that astonishing rapidity ,
of progress which I have described. The sanguine hopes with
which the Spaniards entered upon their career of discovery,
met not with the fame speedy gratification. From the in-
duftry of the rude inhabitants of the New World, they did not
receive a single article of commerce. Even the natural produc-
tions of the foil and climate, when not cherished and multiplied
by the softering and atlive hand of man, were of little ac-
count. Hope, rather than success, incited them to persist in
extending their researches and conquefs; and as government
derived little immediate benefit from these, it left the profecu-
tion of them chiefly to private adventurers, by whose enter-
prizing acivity, more than by any effort of the fiate, the
most valuable possessions of Spain in America were acquired.
Instead of the instantaneous and great advantages which the
Portuguese derived from their discoveries, above half a century
elapsed before the Spaniards reaped any benefit of consequence
from their conquests, except the small quantities of gold which
the islanders were compelled to collea, and the plunder of
the gold and silver employed by the Mexicans and Peruvians
as ornaments of their persons and temples, or as utensils of
sacred or domestic use. It was not until the discovery of the
mines of Potofi in Peru, in the year one thousand five hun-
dred and forty-five, and of those of Sacotecas in Mexico,
soon after, that the Spaniih territories in the New World
brought a permanent and valuable addition of wealth and re-
venue to the mother country.

S E C T NOR did the trade with India differ more from that with

1.'.

America, in refped of the particular circumstance which I have
explained, than in refpeC to the manner of carrying it on, after
it grew to be a considerable objet of political attention. Trade
with the East was a simple mercantile tranfation, confined to the
purchase either of the natural produ&ions of the country, such
as spices, precious stones, pearls, &c. or of the manufacures
which abounded among an industrious race of men, such as
silk and cotton stuffs, porcelane, &c. Nothing more was
requisite in condufcing this trade, than to fettle a few skilful
agents in proper places, to prepare a. proper afolrtment of goods
for completing the cargoes of ships as soon as they arrived
from Europe, or at the utmost to acquire the command of a
few fortified stations, which might secure them admission into
ports where they might careen in safety, and find protection
from the insults of any hostile power. There was no necef-
fity of making any attempt to eftablil colonies, either for
the cultivation of the foil, or the conduct of manufac-
tures. Both these remained, as formerly, in the hands of the
natives.

BUT as soon as that wild spirit of enterprize, which ani-

mated the Spaniards who first explored and subdued the New
World, began to subside, and when, inftea& of roving as ad-
venturers from province to province in quest of gold and
silver, they seriously turned their droughts towards rendering
their conquefis beneficial by cultivation and indutry, they
found it necessary to eftabliih colonies in evmr country which
they wiflicd to improve. Other nations imitated their example

in
Ic

in the settlements which they afterwards made in some of the S E C T.

islands, and on the continent of North America. Europe, _,
after having desolated the New World, began to repeople it,
and under a system of colonization (the spirit and regulations
of which it is not the object of this Difluifition to explain)
the European race has multiplied there amazingly. Every
article of commerce imported from the New World, if we
except the furs and ikins purchased from the independent
tribes of hunters in North America, and from a few tribes in
a similar state on the Southern continent, is the produce of the
industry of Europeans fettled there. To their exertions, or
to those of hands which they have taught or compelled to
labour, we are indebted for sugar, rum, cotton, tobacco, in-
digo, rice, and even the gold and silver extracted from the
bowels of the earth. Intent on those lucrative branches of
induffry, the inhabitants of the New World pay little attention
to those kinds of labour which occupy a considerable part of
the members of other societies, and depend, in some measure,
for their subsistence, and entirely for every article of elegance
and luxury, upon the ancient continent. Thus the Europeans
have become manufacturers for America, and their industry
has been greatly augmented by the vas demands for supplying
the wants of extensive countries, the population of which is
continually increasing. Nor is the influence of this demand
confined solely to the nations which have a more immediate
connection with the American colonies; it is felt in every part
of Europe that furnishes any article exported to them, and
gives activity and vigour to the hand of the artisan in the
inland provinces of Germany, as well as to those in Great

Z 2 Britain

S E C T. Britain and other countries, which carry on a diret trade vlthh

'V. i__ the New World.

BUT while the discovery and conquest of America is allowed

to be one principal cause of that rapid increase of industry and
wealth, which is conspicuous in Europe during the two last
centuries, some timid theoriits have maintained, that through-
out the fame period Europe has been gradually impoverished,
by being drained of its treasure, in order to carry on its trade
with India. But this apprehension has arisen from inattention
to the nature and use of the precious metals. They are to be
confidered in two different lights; either as the signs which
all civilized nations have agreed to employ, in order to estimate
or represent the value both of labour and of all commodities,
and thus to facilitate the purchase of the former, and the
conveyance of the latter from one proprietor to another;
or gold and silver may be viewed as being themselves com-
modities or articles of commerce, for which some equivalent
must be given by such as with to acquire them. In this light,
the exportation of the precious metals to the East should be
regarded; for, as the nation by which they are exported must
purchase them with the produce of its own labour and in-
genuity, this trade must contribute, though not in the fame
obvious and direct manner as that with America, towards aug-
menting the general industry and opulence of Europe. If
England, as the price of Mexican and Peruvian dollars which
are neceflary for carrying on its trade with India, must give a
certain quantity of its woollen or cotton cloth or hard-ware,
then the hands of an additional number of manufacturers are

ecuted, for which, without this trade, there would not have ,
been any demand. The nation reaps all the benefit arising
from a new creation of industry. With the gold and silver
which her manufactures have purchased in the Weft, she is
enabled to trade in the markets of the iaft, and the exporta-
tion of treasure to India, which has been so much dreadedi
inflead of impoverishing, enriches the kingdom.

VIII. IT is to the discovery of the passage to India by the

Cape of Good Hope, and to the vigour and success with
which the Portuguese prosecuted their conquests and eflabliihed
their dominion there, that Europe has been indebted for its
preservation from the mos illiberal and humiliating servitude
that ever oppressed polished nations. For this observation I am
indebted to an Author, whose ingenuity has illulfrated, and
whose eloquence has adorned the History of the Settlements
and Commerce of Modern Nations in the East and Weft
Indies'; and it appears to me so well founded as to merit
more ample investigation. A few years after the first appear-
ance of the Portuguese in India, the dominion of the Mameluks
was overturned by the irresistible power of the Turkish arms,
and Egypt and Syria were annexed as provinces to their
empire. If after this event the commercial intercourse with
India had continued to be carried on in its ancient channels,
the Turkihl Sultans, by being mailers of Egypt and Syria,
mull have possessed the absolute command of it, whether the

IV.

. Alexandria, or were transported by land-carriage from the Per.

fian Gulf to Constantinople, and the ports of the Mediterranean.
The monarchs who were then at the head of this great empire,
were neither deflitute of abilities to perceive the pre-eminence
to which this would have elevated them, nor of ambition to
aspire to it. Selim, the conqueror of the Mameluks, by con-
firming the ancient privileges-of the Venetians in Egypt and
Syria, and by his regulations concerning the duties on Indian
goods, which I have already mentioned, early discovered his
solicitude to secure all the advantages of commerce with the
East to his own dominions. The attention of Solyman the
Magnificent, his successor, seems to have been equally directed
towards the fame objec. More enlightened than any monarch
of the Ottoman race, he attended to all the transaCtions of the
European states, and had observed the power as well as opulence
to which the republic of Venice had attained by engrofling the
commerce with the East. He now beheld Portugal rising
towards the fame elevation, by the fame means. Eager to
imitate and to supplant them, he formed a scheme suitable
to his character for political wisdom and the appellation of Iffi-
tutor of Rules, by which the Turkish Historians have diftin-
guilhed him, and eftablilhed, early in his reign, a system of
commercial laws in his dominions, by which he hoped to
render Constantinople the great staple of Indian trade, as it
had been in the prosperous ages of the Greek empire . For

operation of laws alone; he fitted out about the fame time a ..
formidable fleet in the Red Sea, under the conduc of a con-
fidential officer, with such a body of janizaries on board of it, A.C. 1538.
as he deemed sufficient not only to drive the Portuguese out of
all their new settlements in India, but to take pofIfion of foe
commodious station in that country, and to eret his standard
there. The Portuguese, by efforts of valour and constancy,
entitled to the splendid success with which they were crowned,
repulsed this powerful armament in every enterprize it under-
took, and compelled the shattered remains of the TurkWh fleet
and army to return with ignominy to the harbours from which
they had taken their departure, with the most sanguine hopes
of terminating the expedition in a very different manner'.
Solyman, though he never relinquished the design of etpelling
the Portuguese from India, and of acquiring some establishment
there, was so occupied during the remainder of his reign, by
the multiplicity of arduous operations in which an insatiable
ambition involved him, that he never had leisure to resume the
prosecution of it with vigour.

IF either the measures of Selim had produced the effe& which

he expected, or if the more adventurous and extensive plan of
Solyman had been carried into execution, the command of the
wealth of India, together with such a marine as the monopoly
of trade with that country has, in every age, enabled the power

NOTE I. SECT. I. p. 6.
C REDULITY and fcepticifmn are two opposite extremes

into which men are apt to run, in examining the

events which are said to have happened in the early ages of
antiquity. Without incurring any suspicion of a propensity
to the latter of there, I may be allowed to entertain doubts
concerning the expedition of Seoftris into India, and his
conquest of that country.-- . Few fads in ancient history
seem to be better established, than that of the early aversion
of the Egyptians to a sea-faring life. Even the power of
defpotilfn cannot at once change the ideas and manners of
a nation, especially when they have been confirmed by
long habit, and rendered sacred by the fanaion of religion.
That Sefoftris, in the course of a few years, flould have so

A a 2 entirely

entirely overcome the prejudices of a superstitious people, as
to be able to fit out four hundred thips of force in the Arabian
Gulf, betides another fleet which he had in the Mediterranean,
appears to be extremely improbable. Armaments of such
magnitude would require the utmost efforts of a great and long
established maritime power.-2. It is remarkable that Hero-
dotus, who enquired with the most persevering diligence into
the ancient history of Egypt, and who received all the inform.
atoon concerning it which the priests of Memphis, Heliopolis,
and Thebes, could communicate, Herodot. edit. Wefelingij,
lib. ii. c. 3. although he relates the history of Sefoftris at
some length, does not mention his conquest of India. Lib. ii.
c. Io2, &c. That talc, it is probable, was invented in the
t1riod between the age of Herodotus and that of Diodorus
Siculus, from whom we receive a particular detail of the Indian
expedition of Sefoitris. His account refts entirely upon the
authority of the Egyptian priests; and Diodorus himself not
only gives it as his general opinion, " that many things which
"they related, flowed rather from a desire to promote the
" honour of their country, than from attention to truth',
lib. i. p. 34. edit. Weffelingij, Amft. 1746; but takes particular
notice that the Egyptian priests, as well as the Greek writers,
differ widely from one another in the accounts which they
give of the aclions of Sefoftris, lib. i. p. 62.- 3. Though
Diodorus afterts, that in relating the history of Sefofris he had
studied to fcle& what appeared to him most probable, and
most agreeable to the monuments of that monarch still re-
maining in Egypt, he has admitted into his narrative many
mrarvellous circumstances which render the whole extremely

suspicious.
%So

suspicious. The father of SefoRris, as he relates, collected all
the male children who were born in Egypt on the fame day
with his son, in order that they might be educated, together
with him, conformable to a mode which he prescribcd, with a
view of preparing them as proper inflruments to carry into
execution the great undertakings for which he defined Scfoftris.
Accordingly, when Sefoftris set out upon his Indian expedition,
which, from circumstances mentioned by Diodorus, must have
been about the fortieth year of his age, one thousand seven
hundred of his youthful aflociates are said to have- been fill
alive, and were entrutcd with high command in his army.
But if we apply to the examination of this flory the certain
principles of political arithmetic, it is evident, that if one
thousand seven hundred of the male children born on the ifme
day with Sefoftris were alive when his great expedition com-
menced, the number of children born in Egypt on each
day of the year must have been at least ten thousand, and
the population of the kingdom muff have exceeded sixty
millions; Goguet l'Origine des Loix, des Arts, &c. tom. ii.
p. 12, &c. A number far beyond the bounds of credibility,
in a kingdom which, from the accurate calculations of M.
D'Anville, Memoire fur l'Egypte Anc. et Moderne, p. 23,
&c. does not contain more than two thousand one hundred
square leagues of habitable country. Another marvellous par-
ticular is the description of a ship of cedar, four hundred and
ninety feet in length, covered on the outside with gold, and
on the inside with silver, which Sefoftris consecrated to the
deity who was the chief object of worfihip at Thebes. Lib. i.
p. 67. Such too is the account he gives of the Egvptia army,

in

13i

in which, beside fix hundred thousand infantry, and twenty-
four thousand cavalry, there were twenty-feven thousand armed
chariots. Ibid. p. 64.--4. These and other particulars ap-
peared so far to exceed the bounds of probability, that the
found underfianding of Strabo the geographer rejected, with-
out hesitation, the accounts of the Indian expedition of Sefo-
firis; and he not only asserts, in the most explicit terms, that
this monarch never entered India, lib. xv. p. 1007. C. edit.

not having entered into minute details with refpe& to a trade
which was then removed to new feats, and carried on in other
channels. But the power and opulence of Tyre, in the pro-
fperous age of its commerce, must have attracted general
attention. In the prophecies of Ezekiel, who flourished two
hundred and sixty years before the fall of Tyre, there is the
most particular account of the nature and variety of its com-
mercial tranfa&ions that is to be found in any ancient writer,
and which conveys, at the fame time, a magnificent idea of the
extensive power of that fitate. Ch. xxvi, xxvii, xxviii..

THE account given of the revenue of the Persian monarchy

by Herodotus is curious, and seems to have been copied from
some public record, which had been communicated to him.
According to it, the Persian empire was divided into twenty
Satrapy's, or governments. The tribute levied from each is-
specified, amounting in all to 14,560 Eubaean talents, which Dr.
Arbuthnot reckons to be equal to 2,8o7,4371. sterling money;
a rum extremely small for the revenue of the Great King,
and which ill accords with many fats concerning the riches,
magnificence, and luxury of the East, that occur in ancient
authors.

IT is surprising that Alexander did not receive, in the pro-

vinces contiguous to India, such an account of the periodical
rains in that country, as to hiew him the impropriety of car-
rying on military operations there, while these continued.
His expedition into India commenced towards the end of
Spring, Arrian, lib. iv. c. 22., when the rains were already
begun in thc mountains from which all the rivers in the
P'anjab low, and of course they must have been considerably
wvelled before he arrived onr their banks. Rennell, p. 268.-
lie paued the Hydafpes at Midsummer, about the height of
the rainy season. In a country through which so many large
rivers run, an army on service at this time of the year must
have suffered greatly. An accurate description of the nature
of the rains and inundations in this part of India, is given
by Arrian, lib. v. c. 9.; and one frill fuller may be found
in Strabo, lib. xv. o113.-It was of what they suffered by
there that Alexander's soldiers complained, Strabo, lib. xv.
1021. D.; and not without reason, as it had rained inceflant-
ly during seventy days, Diod. Sicul. xvii. c. 94.-A circum-
llance which marks the accuracy with which Alexander's
officers had attended to every thing in that part of India,
delerves notice. Ariftobulus, in his Journal, which I have
mentioned, takes notice that, though heavy rains fell in the
mountains, and in the country near -to them, in the plains

B. IoS1 . B. Major Rennell was informed by a person of
character, who had resided in this district of India, which
is now seldom visited by Europeans, that during great
part of the S. W. monsoon, or at leaf in the months
of July, Auguf, and part of September, which is the rainy
season in most other parts of India, the atmosphere in
the Delta of the Indus is generally clouded, but no rain
falls, except very near the sea. Indeed, very few showers fall
during the whole season. Captain Hamilton relates, that when
he visited Tatta, no rain had fallen for three years before.
Memoirs, p. 288.-Tamerlane, who, by the vicinity of the feat
of his government to India, had the means of being well
informed concerning the nature of the country, avoided the
error of Alexander, and made his Indian campaign during the
dry season. As Nadir Shah, both when he invaded India,
A. D. 1738, and in his return next year, marched through
the fame countries with Alexander, and nearly in the fame
line of direcion, nothing can give a more flriki:lg idea of the
persevering ardour of the Macedonian conqueror, than tle
description of the difficulties which Nadir Shal had to firmount,
and the hardlhips which his army endured. Though pol-
fefled of absolute power and immense wealth, and diflinguilhed
no less by great talents than long experience in the conduct
of war, he had the mortification to lose a great part of his
troops in crossing the rivers of the Panjab, in penetrating
through the mountains to the north of India, and in conflics
with the fierce natives inhabiting the countries which firetch
from the banks of the Oxus to the fiontiers of Persia. An

THAT a fleet so numerous should have been colleced in

such a fiort time, is apt to appear, at first fight, incredible.
Arrian, however, assures us, that in specifying this number,
he followed Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, whose authority he
confidered to be of the greatest weight, lib. vi. c. 3. But
as the Panjab country is full of navigable rivers, on which all
the intercourse among the natives was carried on, it abounded
with veflels ready conftruaed to the conqueror's hands, so that
lie might easily collec that number. If we could give credit
to the account of the invasion of India by Semiramis, no
fewer than four thousand veftels were assembled in the Indus to
oppose her fleet. Diod. Sicul. lib. ii. c. 74-It is remarkable
that when Mahmoud of Gaznah invaded India, a fleet'was
collected on the Indus to oppose him, confifing of the fame
number of veftels. We learn from the Ayeen Akbery, that
the inhabitants of this part of India fill continue to carry on
all their communication with each other by water; the inhabi-
tants of the Circar of Tatta alone have not less than forty
thousand vcfels of varicus conftruclions. Vol. ii. p. 143.

NOTE VI. SECT. I. p. 19.

ALL these particulars are taken from the Indian History of

Arrian, a work different from that already mentioned, and one
of the most curious treatises transmitted to us from antiquity.
The first part of it consists of extracts from the account given
by Nearchus of the climate and foil of India, and the man-
ners of the natives. The second contains that officer's journal
of his voyage from the mouth of the Indus to the bottom of the
Persian Gulf. The perusal of it gives rife to several obferva-
tions.-- . It is remarkable that neither Nearchus nor Ptolemy,
nor Ariftobulus, nor even Arrian, once mention the voyage
of Scylax. This could not proceed from their being unac-
quainted with it, for Herodotus was a favourite author in the
hands of every Greek who had any pretensions to literature.
It was probably occasioned by the reasons which they had to
distrust the veracity of Scylax, of which I have already taken
notice. Accordingly, in a speech which Arrian puts into the
mouth of Alexander, he asserts that, except Bacchus, he was
the first who had pased the Indus; which implies, that he
disbelieved what is related concerning Scylas, and was not
acquainted with what Darius Hlyflfpes is said to have done
in order to fubje& that part of India to the Persian crown.
Arrian, vii. c. io. This opinion is confirmed by Megafthenes,
who resided a considerable time in India. He aferts that,
except Bacchus and Hercules, (to whose fabulous expeditions
Strabo is aftonillcd that lie fllould have given any credit,

Bb 2 lib.

Dib. xv. p. 007. D.) Alexander was the first who had invaded
India; Arrian, Hilt. Indic. c. 5. We are informed by Arrian,
that the Affacani, and other people who polfeffed that country,
!wich is now called the kingdom of Candahar, paid tribute,
first to the Assyrians, and afterwards to the Medes and Per-
sians; Hifl. Indic. c. i. As all the fertile provinces on the
north-west of the Indus were anciently reckoned to be part of
India, it is probable that what was levied from them is the fum
mentioned in the tribute-roll, from which Herodotus drew his
account of the annual revenue of the Persian empire, and that
none of the provinces to the south of the Indus were ever
luhjecl to the kings of Persia.-2. This voyage of Nearchus
affords some triking instances of the imperfet knowledge
which the ancients had of any navigation different from that
to which they were accustomed in the Mediterranean. Though
the enterprising genius and enlarged views of Alexander
prompted him to attempt opening an intercourse by sea be-
tween India and his Persian dominions, yet both he and
Nearchus knew so little of the ocean which they wilhed to ex-
plore, as to be apprehensive that it might be found impossible to
navigate it, on account of impervious firaits, or other obstacles..
Hilt. Indic. c. 2o. Q Curt. lib. ix. c. 9. When the fleet
arrived near the mouth of the Indus, the astonishment excited
by the extraordinary flow and ebb of tide in the Indian ocean,.
a phenomenon (according to Arrian) with which Alexander
and his foldicrs were unacquainted, lib. vi. c. 19. is another
proof of their ignorance in maritime science. Nor is there
any reason to be surprised at their aftonilhment, as the tides are
hardly perceptible in the Mediterranean, beyond which the

knowledge
iSS

knowledge of the Greeks and Macedonians did not extend.
For the fame reason, when the Romans carried their victorious
arms into the countries situated on the Atlantic Ocean,. or on
the seas that communicate with it, this new phenomenon of the
tides was an obje of wonder and terror to them. Cefar
describes the amazement of his soldiers at a spring-tide, which
greatly damaged the fleet with which he invaded Britain, and
acknowledges that it was an appearance with which they were
unacquainted; Bell. Gallic. lib. iv. c. 29. The tides on the
coast near the mouth of the Indus are remarkably high, and
the effects of them very great, especially that sudden and abrupt
influx of the tide into the mouths of rivers or narrow straits
which is known in India by the name of The Bore, and is
accurately described by Major Rennell, Introd. xxiv. Mem.
278. In the Periplus Maris Erythrai, p. 26., there high tides
are mentioned, and the description of them nearly resembles
that of the Bore. A very exaggerated account of the tides in,
the Indian ocean is given by Pliny, Nat. Hist. lib. xiii. c. 25.
Mlajor Rennell seems to think, that Alexander and his followers
could not be so entirely unacquainted with the phenomenon of
the tides, as Herodotus had informed the Greeks, " that in the
"Red Sea there was a regular ebb and flow of the tide every
"day;" lib. ii c.

c . This is all the explanation of that

phenomenon given by Herodotus. But among the ancients-
there occur instances of inattention to fais, related by refped-
able authors, which appear surprising in modern times. Though
Herodotus, as I have just now observed, gave an account of
the voyage performed by Scylax at considerable length, neither
Alexander,, nor his Historians, take any notice of that event.

I shall:

189

I flall afterwards have occasion to mention a more remarkable
inflance of the inattention of later writers to an accurate
description which Herodotus had given of the Caspian Sea.
From these, and other similar instances which might have been
produced, we may conclude, that the flight mention of the
regular flow and ebb of tide in the Red Sea, is not a sufficient
reason for reje&ing, as incredible, Arrian's account of the fur-
prise of Alexander's soldiers when they first beheld the extra-
ordinary effeds of the tide at the mouth of the Indus.-
3. The course of Nearchus's voyage, the promontories, the
creeks, the rivers, the cities, the mountains, which came fuc-
ceffively in his view, are so clearly described, and the distances
of such as were most worthy of notice are so distinctly marked,
that M. D'Anville, by comparing these with the actual position
of the country, according to the belt accounts of it, ancient
as well as modern, has been able to point out most of the
places which Nearchus mentions, with a degree of certainty
which does as much honour to the veracity of the Grecian
navigator, as to the industry, learning, and penetration of the
French geographer. Mem. de Literat. tom. xxx. p. 132, &c.

IN modern times, the Red Sea is a name appropriated to the

Arabian Gulf, but the ancients denominated the ocean which
itretches from that Gulf to India, the Erythrxan Sea, from
king Erythras, of whom nothing more is known than the
name, which in the Greek language signifies red. From this
casual meaning of the word, it came to be believed, that it
was of a different colour from other seas, and consequently of
more dangerous navigation.

ALEXANDER was so intent on rendering this union of his

tubjeds complete, that after his death there was found in his
tablets or commentaries, (among other magnificent ichemes

IT seems to be an opinion generally received, that Alexander

built only two cities in India, Nicaa and Buccphalia, situatcd
on the Hydafpes, the modern Chelum, and that Craterus
superintendet the building of both. But it is evident, from
Arrian, lib. v. c. ult., that he built a third city on the Acefines,
now the Jenaub, under the direftion of I-cpheftion; and if it
was his object to retain the command of the country, a place
of flrcngtll on some of the rivers to the feuth of the Hydaflces
teems to have been nccefltry for that purpose. This part of India
has bccn lo little vilited in modern times, that it is imipoflihe

to

to point out with precision the situation of these cities. If P.
Tieffenthaler were well founded in his conjecure, that the river
now called Rauvee is the Acefines of Arrian, Bernouilli, vol. i.
p. 39., it is probable that this city was built somewhere near
Lahore, one of the most important tations in that part of
India, and reckoned in the Ayeen Akbery to be a city of
very high antiquity. But Major Rennell, in my opinion, gives
good reasons for supposing the Jenaub to be the Acefines of
the ancients.

THE religious fcrupleswhich prevented the Persians from

making any voyage by sea, were known to the ancients.
l'liny relates of one of the Magi, who was sent on an embassy
from Tiridates to the emperor Nero, " Navigare noluerat,
"quoniam exfpuere in Maria, alijfque mortalium neceflitati-
" bus violare naturam cam, fas non putant ;" Nat. Hists
lib. xxx. c. 2. This aversion to the sea they carried so far,
that, according to the observation of a well-informed Historian,
there was not a city of any note in their empire built upon the
sea-coast; Ammian. Marcel. lib. xxiii. c. 6. We learn from
Dr. Hyde, how intimately there ideas were conneced with the
dodrines of Zoroaster; Rel. Vet. Perf. cap. vi. In all the
wars of the Persians with Greece, the fleets of the Great King
confifed entirely of ships furnilhed by the Phenicians, Syri-
ans, the conquered provinces of the Lesser Alia, and the
ifands adjacent. Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus mention

3 the
192

the quota furnished by each country, in order to compose the
fleet of twelve hundred ships with which Xerxes invaded
Greece, and among there there is not one belonging to Persia.
At the fame time it is proper to observe, that according to
Herodotus, whose authority is unexceptionable with regard to
this point, the fleet was under the command of Ariabigines, a
son of Darius, who had several satraps of high rank under his
command, and both Persians and Medes served as soldiers on
board of it; Herod. lib. vii. c. 96, 97. By what motives,
or what authority, they were induced to a& in this manner, I
cannot explain. From some religious scruples, similar to those
of the Persians, many of the natives of Indoftan, in our own
time, refuse to embark on board a Ihip, and to serve at sea; and
yet, on some occasions, the fepoys in the service of the Eu-
ropean powers have got the better of there scruples.

M. LE BARON DE SAINTE-CROIX, in his ingenious and

learned Critique des Hiltoriens d'Alexandre le Grand, p. 96,
seems to entertain some doubt with refpeft to the number of
the cities which Alexander is said to have built. Plutarch de
Fort. Alex. affirms, that he founded no fewer than seventy.
It appears from many passages in ancient authors, that the
building of cities, or, what may be confidered as the fame,
the efltablifhment of fortified stations, was the mode of main-
taining their authority in the conquered nations, adopted not
only by Alexander, but by his successors. Seleucus and Antiochus,

Cc

to

to whom the greater part of the Persian empire became subjed,
were no left remarkable for founding new cities than Alex-
ander, and there cities seem fully to have answered the purposes
of the founders, as they effectually prevented (as I shall
afterwards have occasion to observe) the revolt of the con-
quered provinces. Though the Greeks, animated with the
love of liberty and of their native country, refused to fettle
in the Persian empire while under the dominion of its native
monarchs, even when allured by the profped of great advan-
tage, as M. de Sainte-Croix remarks, the cafe became perfecly
different, when that empire was fubjeated to their own domi-
nion, and they fettled there, not as fubjecs, but as matters.
Both Alexander and his successors discovered much discernment
in chufing the situation of the cities which they built. Seleu-
cia, which Seleucus founded, was inferior only to Alexandria
in number of inhabitants, in wealth, and in importance; Mr.
Gibbon, vol. i. p. 250. M. D'Anville, Mem. de Literat. xxx,

NOTE XI. SECT. I. p. 29.

IT is from Juftin we receive the fender knowledge we have

of the progress which Seleucus made in India; lib. xv. c. 4.
But we cannot rely on his evidence, unless when it is confirmed
by the testimony of other authors. Plutarch seems to assert,
that Seleucus had penetrated far into India; but that refpecable
writer is more eminent for his discernment of characers, and
his happy feletion of those circumflances which mark and dif-
criminate them, than for the accuracy of his historical re-

searches. Pliny, whose authority is of greater weight, seems
to confider it as certain, that Seleucus had carried his anms
into diftrids of India which Alexander never visited; Plin.
Nat. Hist. lib. vi. c. 17. The passage in which this is men-
tioned, is somewhat obscure, but it seems to imply, that
Seleucus had marched from the Hyphafis to the Hyludrus,
from thence to Palibothra, and from that to the mouth of the
Ganges. The difiances of the principal flations in this march
are marked, amounting to 2244 Roman miles. In this sense,
M. Bayer underRfands the words of Pliny; Hiftor. Regni
Gracorum Baariani, p. 37. But to me it appears highly im-
probable, that the Indian expedition of Seleucus could have
continued so long as to allow time for operations of such
extent. If Seleucus had advanced as far into India as the
mouth of the Ganges, the ancients would have had a more
accurate knowledge of that part of the country than they seem
ever to have possesed.

MAJOR RENNELL gives a magnificent idea of this, by in-

the Rhine, and none smaller than the Thames, besides as

IN fixing the position of Palibothra, I have ventured tor

differ from Major Rennell, and I venture to do so with diffi
dence. According to Strabo, Palibothra was situated at the
junction of the Ganges and another river; lib. xv. p. xo28. A.
Arrian is Rill more explicit. He places Palibothra at the con-
fluence of the Ganges and Erranaboas, the last of which he
describes as less than the Ganges or Indus, but greater than any
other known river; Hilt Ind. c. Io. This description of its
situation corresponds exatly with that of Allahabad. P. Bou-
dier, to whose observations the geography of India is much
indebted, fays, that the Jumna, at its junaion with the Ganges,
appeared to him not inferior in magnitude to that river; D'An-
ville, Antiq. de 1' Inde, p. 53. Allahabad is the name which
was given to that city by the emperor Akbar, who erected a
strong fortress there; an elegant delineation of which is pub-
lifhed by Mr. Hodges, No. IV. of his Selec Views in India.
Its ancient name, by which it is Rill known among the
Hindoos, is Praeg, or Piyag, and the people of the diftri&
are called Praegi, which bears a near resemblance to Prafij, the
ancient appellation of the kingdom of which Palibothra was
the capital; P. Tieffenthaler chez Bernouilli, tom. i. 223.
D'Anville, p. 56. Allahabad is such a noted feat of Hindoo
devotion, that it is denominated The King of Worjohipped
Places; Ayeen Akbery, vol. ii. p. 35. " The territory around

2 "it
05

" it, to the extent of forty miles, is deemed holy ground.
"The Hindoos believe, that when a man dies in this place,
"whatever he wilhes for he will obtain in his next regenera-
"tion. Although they teach that suicide in general will be
"punished with torments hereafter, yet they confider it as
"meritorious for a man to kill himself at Allahabad;" Ayeen
Akbery, iii. 256. P. Tieffenthaler describes the various ob-
jets of veneration at Allahabad, which are fill visited with
great veneration by an immense number of pilgrims; Bernou-
illi, tom. i. 224. From all these circumfances, we may con-
clude it to be a place of great antiquity, and in the fame
situation with the Palibothra of antiquity.

MAJOR RENNELL has been induced to place Palibothra on

the fame site with Patna, chiefly by two considerations.-
x. From having learned that on or near the site of Patna stood
anciently a very large city named Patelpooth-er or Patalipputra,
which nearly resembles the ancient name of Palibothra.
Although there is not now a confluence of two rivers at Patna,
he was informed that the juntion of the Soane with the
Ganges, now twenty-two miles above Patna, was formerly
under the walls of that city. The rivers of India fometirnes
change their course in a singular manner, and he produces
some remarkable inltances of it. But even (lould it be allow-
ed, that the accounts which the natives give of this variation
in the course of the Soane were perfectly accurate, I quelion
whether Arrian's account of the magnitude of the Erranaboas
be applicable to that river, certainly not so juflly as to the

Jumna

1 a*

Jumna.-- . He seems to have been influenced, in some
degree, by Pliny's Itinerary, or Table of DiRances from Taxila
(the modern Attock) to the mouth of the Ganges; Nat. Hist.
lib. vi c. 17. But the distances in that Itinerary are marked
io inaccurately, and in some instances are so palpably erroneous,
that one cannot found upon them with much security. Ac-
cording to it, Palibothra is situated four hundred and twenty-
five miles below the confluence of the Jumna and Ganges.
The aaual distance, however, between Allahabad and Patna,
is not more than two hundred Britilh miles. A disagreement
so considerable cannot be accounted for, without supposing
some extraordinary error in the Itinerary, or that the point of
conflux of the Jumna with the Ganges has undergone a change.
For the former of these suppositions there is no authority
(as far as I know) from any manuscript, or for the latter
from any tradition. Major Rennell has produced the rea-
sons which led him to suppose the site of Palibothra to
be the fame with that of Patna; Memoirs, p. 49-54. Some
of the objecions which might be made to this supposition
he has foreseen, and endeavoured to obviate; and after all
that I have added to them, I shall not be surprised, if, in a
geographical discussion, my readers are disposed to prefer his
decision to mine.

As the distance of Arfinoe, the modem Suez, from the Nile,

is considerably less than that between Berenice and Coptos, it
was by this route that all the commodities imported into the
Arabian Gulf, might have been conveyed with most expedi-
tion and least expence into Egypt. But the navigation of the
Arabian Gulf, which even in the present improved fate of
nautical science is flow and difficult, was in ancient times con-
fidered by the nations around it to be so extremely perilous,
that it led them to give such names to several of its promon-
tories, bays, and harbours, as convey a striking idea of the
impression which the dread of this danger had made upon their
imagination. The entry into the Gulf they called Babelnandeb,
the gate or port of affiction. To a harbour not far distant,
they gave the name of Mete, i. e. Death. A headland adja-
cent they called Gardefan, the Cape of Burial. Other denomi-
nations of similar import are mentioned by the author to
whom I am indebted for this information. Bruce's Travels,
vol. i. p. 442, &c. It is not surprising then, that the Rtaple of
Indian trade flould have been transferred from the northern
extremity of the Arabian Gulf to Berenice, as by this change
a dangerous navigation was greatly ihortened. This seems to
have been the chief reason that induced Ptolemy to eftablilh
the port of communication with India at Berenice, as there
were other harbours on the Arabian Gulf which were confi-
derably nearer than it to the Nile. At a later period, after

the
200

the ruin of Coptos by the Emperor Diocletian, we are informed by
Abulfeda, Defcript. Egypt. edit. Michaelis, p. 77, that Indian com-
modities were conveyed from the Red Sea to the Nile, by the
ihorteft route, viz. from Coffeir, probably the Philoteras Portus
of Ptolemy, to Cous, the Vicus Apollinis, a journey of four days.
The fame account of the distance was given by the natives to
Dr. Pococke, Travels, vol. . p. 87. In consequence of this,
Cous, from a small village, became the city in upper Egypt
next in magnitude to Foftat, or Old Cairo. In process of time,
from causes which I cannot explain, the trade from the Red
Sea by Coffeir removed to Kene, farther down the river than
Cous, Abulf. p. 13. 77. D'Anvilie Egypte, 196-200. In mo-
dern times, all the commodities of India imported into Egypt,
are either brought by sea from Gidda to Suez, and thence
carried on camels to Cairo, or are conveyed by land carriage
by the caravan returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca,
Niebuhr Voyage, tomr. ip. 224. Volney, i. 188, &c. This,
as far as I have been able to trace it, is a complete account of
all the different routes by which the produtions of the East
have been conveyed to the Nile, from the firR opening of that
communication. It is singular that P. Sicard, Mem. des Millions
dans le Levant, tom. ii. p. 157, and some other refpe&able
writers, should suppose Coffeir to be the Berenice founded by
Ptolemy, although Ptolemy has laid down its latitude at 23
5o', and Strabo has described it as nearly under the fame pa-
rallel with that of Syene, lib. ii. p. 195, D. In consequence
of this mistake, Pliny's computation of the distance between
Berenice and Coptos, at two hundred and fifty-eight miles, has
been deemed erroneous. Pococke, p. 87. But as Pliny not

D d only

201

only mentions the total diRtance, but names the different
flations in the journey, and specifies the number of miles be-
tween each; and as the Itinerary of Antoninus coincides ex-
adly with his account, D'Anville Egypte, p. 21, there is no.
reason to call in question the accuracy of it.

NOTE XVII. SECT.I. P. 37.

IsMAJO RENNELL is of opinion, " that under the Ptolemies,

the Egyptians extended their navigation to the extreme point
of the Indian continent, and even failed up the Ganges to
Palibothra," now Patna. Introd. p. xxxvi. But had it been
usual to fail up the Ganges as high as Patna, the interior parts
of India muif have been better known to the ancients than
they ever were, and they would not have continued to derive
their information concerning them from Megafthenes alone.
Strabo begins his description of India in a very remarkable
manner. He requests his readers to pcrufe with indulgence
the account which he gives of it, as it was a country very
remote, and few persons had visited it; and of these, many hav-
ing seen only a small part of the country, related things either
from hear-say, or, at the beit, what they had hastily remarked
while they passed through it in the course of military service,
or on a journey. Strabo, lib. xv. p. ioo5. B. He takes notice
that few of the traders from the Arabian Gulf ever reached
the Ganges. Ibid. 1oo6. C. He aerts, that the Ganges enters

7 the
202

the sea by one mouth, ibid. oIo . C.; an error into which he
could not have fallen if the navigation of that river had been
common in his time. He mentions indeed the failing up the
Ganges, ibid. Ioio, but it is cursorily in a single sentence;
whereas, if such a considerable inland voyage of above four
hundred miles, through a populous and rich country, had been
customary, or even if it had ever been performed by the Roman,
or Greek, or Egyptian traders, it must have merited a parti-
cular description, and mufl have been mentioned by Pliny and
other writers, as there was nothing similar to it in the pracice
of navigation among the ancients. It is observed by Arrian
(or whoever is the author of the Periplus Maris Erythrai),
that previous to the discovery of a new route to India, which
shall be mentioned afterwards, the commerce with that coun-
try was carried on in small vessels which failed round every bay,
p. 32. Ap. Hudf. Geogr. Min. Vessels of such light conftruc-
tion, and which followed this mode of failing, were ill fitted for
a voyage so distant as that round Cape Comorin, and up the
bay of Bengal, to Patna. It is not improbable, that the mer-
chants whom Strabo mentions as having reached the Ganges,
may have travelled thither by land, either from the countries
towards the mouth of the Indus, or from some part of the
Maalabar coast, and that the navigation up the Ganges, of which
he casually takes notice, was performed by the natives in vessels
of the country. This opinion derives some confirmation from
his remarks upon the bad ftrucure of the vessels which fre-
quented that part of the Indian ocean. From his description
of them, p. Iol2. C. it is evident that they were vessels of
the country.

THE erroneous ideas of many intelligent writers of antiquity

with refpe& to the Caspian Sea, though well known to every
man of letters, are so remarkable, and afford such a striking
example of the imperfedion of their geographical know-
ledge, that a more full account of them may not only be
acceptable to some of my readers, but in endeavouring to trace
the various routes by which the commodities of the East were
conveyed to the nations of Europe, it becomes necessary to
enter into some detail concerning their various sentiments with
refpel to this matter. i. According to Strabo, the Caspian is
a bay, that communicates with the great Northern ocean, from
which it issues at firit, by a narrow ifrait, and then expands
into a sea extending in breadth five hundred stadia, lib. xi. p.
773. A. With him Pomponius Mela agrees, and describes the
firait by which the Caspian is connelced with the ocean, as of
considerable length, and so narrow that it had the appearance of
a river, lib. iii. c. i. edit. Pliny likewise gives a similar de-
scription of it, Nat. Hill. lib. vi. c. 13. In the age of
Justinian, this opinion concerning the communication of the
Caspian Sea with the ocean, was till prevalent; Cofm. In-
dicopl. Topog. Christ. lib. ii. p. 138. C. 2. Some early
writers, by a mistake fill more singular, have supposed the
Caspian Sea to be conneaed with the Euxine. Quintu6 Curtius,
whole ignorance of geography is notorious, has adopted this
error, lib. vii. c. 7. edit. 3. Arrian, though a much more

judicious
20o

judicious writer, and who by residing for some time in the
Roman province of Cappadocia, of which he was go-
vernor, might have obtained more accurate information, de-
clares in one place, the origin of the Caspian Sea to be still
unknown, and is doubtful whether it was connected with the
Euxine, or with the great Eastern ocean which surrounds India;
lib. vii. c. i6. In another place he afterts, that there was a
communication between the Caspian and the Eastern ocean;
lib. v. c. 26. These errors appear more extraordinary, as a
jus description had been given of the Caspian by Herodotus,
near five hundred years before the age of Strabo. " The Caspian,
fays he, is a sea by itself, unconneced with any other. Its
length is as much as a vessel with oars can fail in fifteen days,
its greatest breadth as much as it can fail in eight days;" lib. i.
c. 203. Aristotle describes it in the fame manner, and with his
usual precision contends that it ought to be called a great lake
not a sea; Meteorolog. lib. ii. Diodorus Siculus concurs
with them in opinion, vol. ii. lib. xviii. p. 26r. None of those
authors determine whether the greatest length of the Caspian
was from North to South, or from East to Weft. In the an-
cient maps which itlutfrate the geography of Ptolemy, it is
delineated, as if its greatest length extended from East to Weft.
In modern times the first information concerning the true
form of the Caspian which the people of Europe received, was
given by Anthony Jenkinfon, an Englilh merchant, who with
a caravan from Rullia travelled along a considerable part of
its coast in the year iS18; Hakluyt Collec. vol. i p. 334.
The accuracy of Jenkinfon's description was confirmed by an
adtual survey of that lea made by order of Peter the Great,

4 A.D.

205

A D. 1718, and it is now ascertained not only that the
Caspian is unconnected with any other sea, but that its length
from North to South is considerably more than its greatest
breadth from East to Welt. From this detail, however, we
learn how the ill-founded ideas concerning it, which were gene-
rally adopted, gave rife to various wild schemes of conveying
Indian commodities to Europe by means of its supposed com-
munication with the Euxine sea, or with the Northern ocean.
It is an additional proof of the attention of Alexander the
Great to every thing conducive to the improvement of com-
merce, that a ihort time before his death he gave directions to
fit out a squadron in the Caspian, in order to survey that sea,
and to discover whether it was conneted either with the
Euxine or Indian ocean; Arrian. lib. vii. c. 16.

NOTE XIX. SECT. I. p. 49.

FROMI this curious detail, we learn how imperfed ancient

navigation was, even in its moR improved Rate. The voyage
from Berenice to Ocelis, could not have taken thirty days, if
any other course had been held than that of servilely following
the windings of the coat. The voyage from Ocelis to Mufiris
would be (according to Major Rennell) fifteen days run for
an European sip in the modern Rile of navigation, being
about seventeen hundred and fifty marine miles, on a fireight
course; Introd. p. x!xxvii. It is remarkable, that though
the Periplus Maris Erythrei was written after the voyage of
Hippalus, the chief objedt of the author of it is to describe

the
0o6

the ancient course along the coasts of Arabia and Persia, to the
mouth of the Indus, and from thence down the wetern shore
of the continent to Mufiris. I can account for this, only by
supposing, that from the unwillingness of mankind to abandon
old habits, the greater part of the traders from Berenice fill
continued to follow that route to which they were accustomed.
To go from Alexandria to Mufiris, required (according to Pliny)
ninety-four days. In the year 1788, the Boddam, a ihip
belonging to the Englilh Eaft-India Company, of a thousand
tuns burthen, took only fourteen days more to complete her
voyage from Portsmouth to Madras. Such are the improve-
ments which have been made in navigation.

IT was the opinion of Plato, that in a well-regulated common-

wealth the citizens should not engage in commerce, nor the slate
aim at obtaining maritime power. Commerce, he contends,
would corrupt the purity of their morals, and by entering into
the fea-fervice, they would be accufomed to find pretexts for
jultifying conduct so inconfiltent with what was manly and
becoming, as would gradually relax the ftridnefs of military
difcip!ine. It had been better for the Athenians, he asserts, to
have continued to fend annually the sons of seven of their
principal citizens to be devoured by the Minotaur,. than to have
changed their ancient manners, and to have become a mari-
time power. In that perfect republic, of which he delineates
the form, he ordains that the capital should be situated at leaf

tell

207

ten miles from the sea; De Legibus, lib. iv. ab initio. These
ideas of Plato were adopted by other philosophers. Aristotle
enters into a formal discussion of the question, whether a State
rightly confiituted should be commercial or not; and though
abundantly disposed to espouse sentiments opposite to those
of Plato, he does not venture to decide explicitly with respect
to it; De Repub. lib. vii. c. 6. In ages when such opinions
prevail, little information concerning commerce can be expeced.

reconcile them, or to determine which is most comformable to
truth. I have adhered to the former, because we have many
instances of the exorbitant price of pearls, but none, as far as
I know, of diamonds having been purchased at a rate so high.
In this opinion I am confirmed by a passage in Pliny, lib. xix.

" quat pratia excellentium Margaritarum;" which implies,
that he confidered them to be of higher price than any other
commodity.

PLINY has devoted two entire books of his Natural History,

lib. xii. and xiii. to the enumeration and description of the
spices, aromatics, ointments, and perfumes, the use of which
luxury had introduced among his countrymen. As many of
there were the productions of India, or of the countries beyond
it, and as the trade with the East was carried on to a great extent
in the age of Pliny, we may form some idea of the immense
demand for them, from the high price at which they continued
to be fold in Rome. To compare the prices of the fame com-
modities in ancient Rome, with those now paid in our own
country, is not a gratification of curiosity merely, but affords
a ltandard by which we may eltimate the different degree of
success with which the Indian trade has been conducted in
ancient and modern times. Many remarkable paflages in
ancient authors, concerning the extravagant price of precious
floncs and pearls among the Romans, as well as the general
use of them by persons of all ranks, are colleted by Meurfius

he communicated the first notice to the moderns. " This is
produced by small infecs nearly resembling snails. They do
not form cocoons either round or oval like the silk-worm, but
spin very long threads, which fasten themselves to trees and
bushes as they are driven by the wind. These are gathered,
and wrought into silk tfuffs, coarser than those produced by
domestic silk-worms. The infeas who produce this coarse silk
are wild." Description de l'Empire de la Chine, tom. ii. folio,
p. 207. This nearly resembles Virgil's description,

Velleraque ut foliis depeftant tenuia Seres.

An attentive reader of Virgil will find, that, besides all the
other qualities of a great descriptive poet, he pofreffed an ex-
tensive knowledge of natural history. The nature and pro-
duaions of the wild silk-worms are illustrated at greater length
in the large collcaion of Memoires conccrnant I'Hiftoire, les
Sciences, les Arts, &c. des Chincis, tom. ii. p. 575, &c.; and
by Pere de Mailla, in his voluminous History of China, tom. xiii.
p 434. It is a singular circumstance in the history of silk, that

the modern Pultanah, on the southern banks of the river
Godvery, two hundred and seventeen British miles south
from Baroach; that the position of Tagara is the fame with
that of the modern Dowlatabad, and the high grounds across
which the goods were conveyed to Baroach, are the Ballagaut

As Rome was still far inferior to Greece in science, the execu-
tion of this great undertaking was committed to three Greeks,
men of great abilities, and skilled in every part of philosophy.
The survey of the caftern division of the empire was finished

As these public Surveys and Itineraries furnfihed the ancient

duced a new delineation and measurement of the countries
which were the feat of it. We may conclude from Vegetius,
Inlit. Rei Militaris, lib. iii. c. 6., that every governor of a
Roman province was furnihed with a description of it; in
which were specified the distance of places in miles, the nature
of the roads, the bye-roads, the ihort cuts, the mountains,
the rivers, &c.; all these, fays he, were not only described in
words, but were delineated in a map, that, in deliberating con-
cerning his military movements, the eyes of a general might
aid the decisions of his mind.

NOTE XXIX. SECT. II. p. 66.

TIE consequence of this mistake is remarkable. Ptolemy,

lib. vii. c. ., computes the longitude of Barygaza, or Baroach,
to be 17° 20'; and that of Cory, or Cape Comorin, to be
13° 20'. which is the difference of four degrees precisely;
whereas the real difference between there two places is nearly
fourteen degrees.

NOTE XXX. SECT. II. p. 66.

RAMUSIO, the publilher of the most ancient and perhaps

the most valuable Colletion of Voyages, is the first person,
as far as I know, who takes notice of this strange error of
Ptolemy; Viaggi, vol. i. p. 1l . He jufly observes, that the

Author

Author of the Circumnavigation of the Erythrean Sea had been
more accurate, and had described the peninsula of India as ex-
tending from north to south; Peripl. p. 24. 29.

NOTE XXXI. SECT. II. p. 68.

THIS error of Ptolemy justly merits the name of enormous,

which I have given to it; and it will appear more surprising
when we recollet, that he must have been acquainted, not only
with what Herodotus relates concerning the circumnavigation
of Africa, by order of one of the Egyptian kings, Lib. iv.
c. 4., but with the opinion of Eratosthenes, who held that the
great extent of the Atlantic ocean-was the only thing which pre-
vented a communication between Europe and India by sea;
Strab. Geogr. lib. i. p. 113. A. This error, however, must not
be imputed wholly to Ptolemy. Hipparchus, whom we may
confider as his guide, had taught that the earth is not fur-
rounded by one continuous ocean, but that it is separated by
different isthmuses, which divide it into several large bafons;
Strab. lib. i. p. i . B. Ptolemy, having adopted this opinion,
was induced to maintain that an unknown country extended
from Cattigara to Praffum on the south.east coast of Africa;
Geogr. lib. vii. c. 3 and 5. As Ptolemy's fyflem of geography
was universally received, this error spread along with it. In
conformity to it the Arabian geographer Edrifli, who wrote in
the twelfth century, taught that a continued traa of land
firetched eastward from Sofala on the African coast, until it
united with some part of the Indian continent; D'Anville,

exhibited this imaginary trad of land which Ptolemy supposes
to have conneced Africa with Aria; Geographie des Grecs
analyice.

NOTE XXXII. SECT. IL p. 69.

IN this part of the Disquisition, as well as in the map pre-

pared for illufrating it, the geographical ideas of M. D'Anville,
to which Major Rennell has given the fandion of his appro-
bation, Introd. p. xxxix. have been generally adopted. But
M. Gofellin has lately publihed, " The Geography of the
"Greeks analifed; or, the Systems of Eratosthenes, Strabo, and
"Ptolemy, compared with each other, and with the Knowledge
"which the Moderns have acquired ;" a learned and ingenious
work, in which he differs from his countryman with refped to
many of his determinations. According to M. Goffellin, the
Magnum Promontorium, which M. D'Anville concludes to be
Cape Romania, at the southern extremity of the peninsula of
Malacca, is the point of Bragu, at the mouth of the great river
Ava; near to which he places Zaba, supposed by M. D'Anville,
and by Barros, Decad. ii. liv. vi. c. I. to be situated on the trait
of Sincapura or Malacca. The Magnus Sinus of Ptolemy he
holds to be the fame with the Gulf of Martaban, not the
Gulf of Siam, according to NM. D'Anville's decision. The

~~~~~2 ~position
216

position of Cattigara, as he endeavours to prove, corresponds
to that of Mergui, a considerable port on the weft coast of
the kingdom of Siam, and that Thin:, or Sine Metropolis,
which M. D'Anville removes as far as Sin-hoa, in the king-
dom of Cochin-China, is situated on the fame river with
Mergui, and now bears the name of Tana-ferim. The Ibadij
Infula of Ptolemy, which M. D'Anville determines to be
Sumatra, he contends, is one of that cluster of small isles
which lie off this part of the coast of Siam; p. 137-148.
According to M. Gofiellin's fyltem, the ancients never failed
through the Straits of Malacca, had no knowledge of the
island of Sumatra, and were altogether unacquainted with the
Eastern Ocean. If to any of my readers these opinions appear
to be well founded, the navigation and commerce of the
ancients in India must be circumscribed within limits still more
confined than those which I have allotted to them. From the
Ayeen Akbery, vol. ii. p. 7. we learn that Cheen was an ancient
name of the kingdom of Pegu; as that country borders upon
Ava, where M. Goffellin places the Great Promontory, this
near resemblance of names may appear, perhaps, to confirm
his opinion that Sina: Metropolis was situated on this coast,
and not so far East as M. D'Anville has placed it.

As Ptolemy's geography of this eastern division of Asia is

more erroneous, obscure, and contradicory than in any other
part of his work, and as all the manuscripts of it,
both Greek and Latin, are remarkably incorrect in the two
chapters which contain the description of the countries be-
yond the Ganges, M. D'Anville, in his Memoir concerning

F f the

217

the limits of the world known to the ancients beyond the
Ganges, has admitted into it a larger portion of conjecture
than we find in the other researches of that cautious geogra-
pher. He likewise builds more than usual upon the refem-
blances between the ancient and moder names of places,
though at all times he discovers a propensity, perhaps too
great, to trace these, and to reft upon them. These
resemblances are often, indeed, very striking, and have led
him to many happy discoveries. But in perusing his works,
it is impolible, I lhould think, not to perceive that some which
he mentions are far fetched and fanciful. Whenever I follow
him, I have adopted only, such condufions as seem to be efta-
blilhed with his accustomed accuracy.

NOTE XXXIII. SECT. II. p. 78.

THE Author of the Circumnavigation of the Erythr2an

Sea has marked the distances of many of the places which he
mentions, with such accuracy as renders it a nearer approach,
than what is to be found in any writer of antiquity, to a
complete survey of the coast from Myos-hormus, on the
weft fide of the Arabian Gulf, along the lhores of Ethiopia,
Arabia, Persia, and Caramania, to the mouth of the Indus,
and thence down the weft coast of the Indian Peninsula to
Mufiris and Barace. This adds to the value of this liort
treatise, which, in every other respect, poffefles great merit.
It may be confidered as a remarkable proof of the extent and

5 accuracy
211

accuracy of this Author's intelligence concerning India, that he
is the only ancient writer who appears in any degree to have been
acquainted with the great division of the country, which still
subsists, viz. Indotan Proper, comprehending the northern pro-
vinces of the Peninsula, and the Deccan, comprehending the
southern provinces. " From Barygaza (fays he) the continent
" firetches to the south; hence that diftri& is called Dachina-
"bades, for, in the language of the country, the south is called
"Dachanos ;" Peripl. p. 29. As the Greeks and Romans, when
they adopt any foreign name, always gave it a terminationpeculiar
to their own language, which the grammatical ftruture of both
tongues rendered, in some degree, necessary, it is evident that
Dachanos is the fame with Deccan, which word has still the
fame signification, and is fill the name of that division of the
Peninsula. The northern limit of the Deccan at present is
the river Nerbuddah, where our Author likewise fixes it.

NOTE XXXIV. SECT. II. p. 81.

THOUGH, in deducing the latitudes of places from obferva-

tions of the fun or flars, the ancient afironomers negleced
several corrections, which ought to have been applied, their
results were sometimes exact to a few minutes, but at other
times they appear to have been erroneous to the extent of two,
or even three degrees, and may perhaps be reckoned, one with
another, to have come within half a degree of the truth. This

Fs 2 part

219

part of the ancient geography would therefore have been
tolerably accurate, if there had been a sufficient number of
such determinations. These, however, were far from being
numerous, and appear to have been confined to some of the
more remarkable places in the countries which surround the
Mediterranean sea.

WIENW, from want of more accurate observations, the lati-

tude was inferred from the length of the longef or shortest
day, no great degree of precision was, in any cafe, to be ex-
peaed, and leaR of all in the vicinity of the Equator. An
error of a quarter of an hour, which, without some mode of
measuring time more accurate than ancient observers could
employ, was not easily avoided, might produce, in such
ituations, an error of four degrees in the determination of
the latitude.

\VITH refpccl to places in the torrid zone, there was another

resource for determining the latitude. This was by observing
the time of the year when the flit was vertical to any place,
or when bodies that stood perpendicular to the horizon had no
shadow at noon-day; the fun's diflanc from the Equator at
that time, which was known from the principles of atlronomy,
was equal to the latitude of the place. We have infances
of the application of this method in the determination of the
parallels of Syene and Meroe. The accuracy which this
method would admit of, seems to be limited to about half a
degree, and this only on the supposition that the observer was
flationary i for if he was travelling from one place to another,
210

6

and

and had not an opportunity of corre&ing the observation of
one day by that of the day following, he was likely to deviate
much more considerably from the truth.

WITIr respect to the longitude of places, as eclipses of the

moon are not frequent, and could seldom be of use for deter.
mining it, and only when there were astronomers to observe
thein with accuracy, they may be left out of the account alto-
gether. when we are examining the geography of remote
countries. The differences of the meridians of places were
therefore anciently ascertained entirely by the bearings and
diflances of one place from another, and of consequence all the
errors of reckonings, surveys, and itineraries, fell chiefly upon the
longitude, in the fame manner as happens at prelent in a ihip
which has no method of determining its longitude, but by
comparing the dead-reckoning with the ohfervations of the
latitude; though with this difference, that the errors, to which
the molt skilful of the ancient navigators was liable, were far
greater than what the most ignorant fhip-nmfter of modern
times, provided with a compass, can well commit. The
length of the Mediterranean meafilred, in degrees of longitude,
from the Pillars cf Hercules to the Bay of Ilffus, is le's than
forty degrees; but in Ptolemy's maps it is more than sixty,
and, in general, his longitudes, counting from the meridian
of Alexandria, especially toward the East, are erroneous
nearly in the fame proportion. It appears, indeed, that
in remote leas, the coasts were often delineated from an
imperfct account of the distances lailed, without the least
knowledge of the bearings or dirctdion of the ship's courfc.

Ptolemy,

221

Ptolemy, it is true, used to make an allowance of about
one-third for the winding of a ihip's course, Geogr.
lib. i. c. i .; but it is plain, that the application of this gene-
ral rule could seldom lead to an accurate conclusion. Of this
there is a striking inflance in the form which that geographer
has given to the Peninsula of India. From the Barygazenum
Promontorium to the place marked Locus unde folvunt in
Chryfen navigantes, that is, from Surat on the Malabar coast,
to about Narfapour on the Coromandel coast, the distance mea-
fured along the sea-shore is nearly the fame with what it is in
reality; that is, about five hundred and twenty leagues. But
the mistake in the direcion is astonishing, for the Malabar and
Coromandel coast, instead of stretching to the south, and in-
terfeding one another at Cape Comorin, in a very acute
angle, are extended by Ptolemy almoR in the fame itraight
line from weft to east, declining a little to the south. This
coast is, at the fame time, marked with fevcral bays and pro-
montories, nearly resembling, in their position, those which
actually exist on it. All these circumstances compared toge-
ther, point out very clearly what were the materials from
which the ancient map of India was composed. The ships
which had visited the coaf of that country, had kept an account
of the time which they took to fail from one place to another, and
had marked, as they stood along shore, on what hand the land
ly, when they (haped their course across a bay, or doubled a pro-
montory. This imperfed journal, with an inaccurate account,
perhaps, of the latitude of one or two places, was probably all
the information concerning the coast of India, which Ptolemy
was able to procure. That he ihould have been able to pro-

cure

cure no better information from merchants who failed with no
particular view of exploring the coast, will not appear won-
derful, if we confider that even the celebrated Periplus of
Hanno would not enable a geographer to lay down the coast
of Africa with more precision, than Ptolemy has delineated that
of India.

occupied his attention, he has examined this event with an

THIS voyage, together with the observations of Abu Zeid

under the title of " Anciennes Relations des Indes, et de la.

Chine, de deux Voyageurs Mahometans, qui y allerent
dans le Neuvieme Siecle traduites de Arabe, avec des re-
marques fur les principaux endroits de ces Relations." As

M. Renandot, in his remarks, represents the literature and police
of the Chinese, in colours very different from those of the
splendid descriptions which a blind admiration had prompted
the Jesuits to publifP, two zealous missionaries have called in
question the authenticity of there Relations, and have asserted
that the authors of them had never been in China; P. Premare
Lettr. edifiantes et curieufes, tom. xix. p. 420, &c. P. Pa-
rennin, ibid. tom. xxi. p. 158, &c. Some doubts concerning
their authenticity were entertained likewise by several learned
men in England, on account of M. Renaudot's having given
no notice of the manuscript which he translated, but that he
found it in the library of M. le Comte de Seignelay. As no
person had seen the manuscript since that time, the doubts
increased, and M. Renaudot was charged with the crime of
impoling upon the public. But the Colbert Manuscripts hav-
ing been deposited in the King's Library, as (fortunately for
literature) molt private collections are in France, M. de Guig-
nes, after a long search, discovered the identical manuscript to

which

4.
124

which M. Renaudot refers. It appears to have been written
in the twelfth century; Journal des Scavans, Dec. 1764,
p. 315, &c. As I had not the French edition of M. Re-
naudot's book, my references are made to the Englilh tranf-
lation. The Relation of the two Arabian Travellers is con-
firmed, in many points, by their countryman Maffbudi, who
published his treatise on universal history, to which he gives
the fantastical title of " Meadows of Gold, and Mines of
" Jewels," a hundred and fix years after their time. From
him, likewise, we receive such an account of India in the tenth
century, as renders it evident that the Arabians had then acquired
an extensive knowledge of that country. According to his
description, the peninsula of India was divided into four king-
doms. The first was composed of the provinces situated on
the Indus, and the rivers which fall into it; the capital of
which was Moultan. The capital of the second kingdom was
Canoge, which, from the ruins of it fill remaining, appears to
have been a very large city; Rennell's Memoirs, p. 54. In
order to give an idea of its populousness, the Indian historians
aftert, that it contained thirty thousand Ihops, in which betel-nut
was fold, and sixty thousand sets of musicians and fingers, who
paid a tax to government; Ferifhta, 'ranflated by Dow, vol. i.
p. 32. The third kingdom was Cachemire. Maffoudi, as far
as I know, is the first author who mentions this paradise of
India, of which he gives a short but just description. The
fourth is the kingdom of Guzerate, which he represents as the
greatest and most powerful; and lie concurs with the two
Arabian Travellers, in giving the sovereigns of it the appellation
of Balhara. What Malfoudi relates concerning India is more

G g worthy

s25

w.ortlhy of notice, as he himself had visited that country;
Notices ct Extraits des Manufcrits de la Bibliotheque du Roi,
tom. i. p. 9, lo. Maffoudi confirms what the two Arabian
Travellers relate, concerning the extraordinary progress of the
Indians in astronomical science. According to his account, a
temple was built during the reign of Brahman, the first mo-
narch of India, with twelve towers, representing the twelve
signs of the zodiac; and in. which was delineated, a view of
all the stars as they appear in the heavens. In the fame reign
was compored the famous Sind-Hind, which seems to be the
flandard treatise of Indian astronomy; Notices, &c. tom. i.
p. 7. Another Arabian author, who wrote about the middle
of the fourteenth century, divides India into three parts. The
northern, comprehending all the provinces on the Indus. The
middle, extending from Guzerate to the Ganges. The south-
cm, which he denominates Comar, from Cape Comorin; No-
tices, &c. tom. ii. p. 46.

TuE naval skill of the Chinese seems not to have been tu-

perior to that of the Greeks, the Romans, or Arabians. The
course which they held from Canton to Siraf, near the mouth
of the Persian Gulf, is described by their own authors. They
kept as near as poflible to the fiore until they reached the
island of Ceylon, and then doubling Cape Comorin, they failed
along the weft fide of the Peninsula, as far as the mouth of the

Incdus,

Inllus, and thence fleered along the coast to the place of
tiheir destination; Mem. de Literat. tomr. xxxii. p. 367.
Some authors have contended, that both the Arabs and
Cllinele were well acquainted with the mariners compass,
and the use of it in navigation; but it is remarkable that
in the Arabic, Turkilli, or Persian languages there is no
original name for the compass. They commonly call it Boffila,
the Italian name, which lhews that the thing significd is
bfreign to them as well as the word. There is not one single
oblcrvatioll, of ancient date, made by the Arabs on the varia-
tion of the needle, or any inflrucion deduced from it, for the
aflifance of navigators. Sir John Chardin, one of the most
learned and best informed travellers who has visited the Eart,
having been conlilted upon this point, returns for answer, " I
"boldly afrert, that the Asiatics are belolden to us for this
"wonderful infirument, which they had from Europe a long
" time before the Portuguese conquests. For, first, their
"compafles are exadly like ours, and they buy them of
"Europeans as much as they can, scarce daring to meddle with

their needles themselves. Secondly, It is certain that the

"old navigators only coasted it along, which I impute to their
" want of this infirument to guide and inflruct them in the
" middle of the ocean. We cannot pretend to fay that they
"were afraid of venturing far from home, for the Arabs, the
" irll navigators in the world, in my opinion, at least for the
" afltern seas, have, time out of mind, failed from the bottom
" of the Red Sea, all along the coast of Africa; and the
" Chinese have always traded with Java and Sumatra, which

Gg 2 "is

2:

' is a very considerable voyage. So many islands uninhabited
" and yet productive, so many lands unknown to the people I

fpcak of, are a proof that the old navigators had not the

" art of failing on the main sea. I have nothing but argu-
" ment to offer touching this matter, having never met with
" any person in Persia or the Indies to inform me when the

THE progress of ChrifRianity, and of Mahomedanlfm, both

in China and India, is attested by such evidence as leaves no
doubt with refpea to it. This evidence is collected by Affe-
mannus, Biblioth. Orient. vol. iv. p. 437, &c. 52I, &c.; and by
M. Renaujot, in two Dissertations annexed to Anciennes
Relations; and by M. de la Croze, Hiftoire de Chriflianifme
des Indes. In our own age, however, we know that the num-
ber of proselytes to either of these religions is extremely small,
especially in India. A Gentoo confiders all the diftinaions
and privileges of his cast, as belonging to him by an exclusive
and incommunicable right. To convert, or to be converted,
are ideas equally repugnant to the principles molt deeply rooted
in his mind; nor can either the Catholic or Proteflant miflion-
aries in India boast of having overcome these prejudices, except
among a few in the lowest catls, or of such as have loft their
cast altogether. This last circumltance is a great obstacle to the
progress of ChrifRianity in India. As Europeans eat the flelh
of that animal which the Hindoos deem sacred, and drink in-
toxicating liquors, in which practices they are imitated by the
converts to Chriflianity, this links them to a level with the
l'ariars, the most contemptible and odious race of men. Some
Catholic miflionaries were so sensible of this, that they affeced to
imitate the dress and manner of living of Brahmins, and refuifed
to aflociate with the Pariars, or to admit them to the participation
of the Sacraments. But this was condemned by the apostolic

legate

FROM the Chronicle of Andrew Dandulo, Doge of Venice,

who was elevated to that high station at a time when his coun-
trymen had eftablilhed a regular trade with Alexandria, and
imported from it all the productions of the East, it was natural
to cxpec some information concerning their early trade with
that country; but, except an idle tale concerning some Ve-
netian ships which had failed to Alexandria about the year 828,
contrary to a decree of the slate, and which Rtole thence the

between the two countries. On the contrary, circumflanccs
occur, which shew that the resort of Europeans to Egypt had
ceased, almost entirely, for some time. Prior to the seventh
and eighth centuries, the greater part of the public deeds in
Italy, and in other countries of Europe, were written upon
paper fabricated of the Egyptian Papyrus; but after that pe-
riod, as Europeans no longer ventured to trade in Alexan-
dria, almost all charters and other deeds are written upon
parchment. Murat. Antiq. Ital. Medii £Evi, vol. iii. p. 832.
I have been induced, both in the text and in this note, to state
these particulars concerning the interruption of trade between
the Chriiflans and Mahometans so fully, in order to corret an
error into which several modern authors have fallen, by fuppof-
ing, that soon after the first conquests of the Caliphs, the trade
with India returned into its ancient channels, and the mcr-

IT is proper to remark (fays Mr. Stewart) that the Indians

have an admirable method of'rendering their religion lucrative,
it being usual for the Faquirs to carry with them, in their pil-
grimages from the sea-coasts to the interior parts, pearls,
corals, spices, and other precious articles, of small bulk, which
they exchange, on their return, for gold-duff, muik, and other
things of a similar nature, concealing them easily in their hair,
and in the cloths round their middle, carrying on, in propor-
tion to their numbers, no inconsiderable traffic by these means.

NEITHER Joviur, the profefied panegyrist of the Medici, nor

which it was acquired. Even Machiavel, whose genius de-
lighted in the invefligation of every circumstance which contri-
buted to aggrandize or depress nations, seems not to have viewed
the commerce of his country as a fubjedc that merited any
elucidation. Denina, who has entitled the first chapter of his
eighteenth book, " The Origin of the Medici, and the Com-
" mencement of their Power and Grandeur," furnishes little
information with regard to the trade carried on by them. This

silence

silence of so many authors is a proof that historians had not
yet begun to view commerce as an object of such importance
in the political state of nations, as to enter into any detail con-

LEIBNITZ has preserved a curious paper, containing the'In-

fIrutions of the republic of Florence to the two ambassadors
sent to the Soldan of Egypt, in order to negociate this treaty with
him, together with the report of these ambassadors on their
return. The great object of the republic was, to obtain liberty
of trading in all parts of the Soldan's dominions, upon the fame
terms with the Venetians. The chief privileges which they
solicited, were; i. A perfet freedom of admiflion into every
port belonging to the Soldan, protection while they continued
in it, and liberty of departure at what time they chose. a. Per-
iiffion to have a consul, with the fame rights and jurifdiioon
as those of the Venetians; and liberty to build a church, a
warehouse, and a bath, in every place where they fettled.
3. That they ihould not pay for goods imported or exported
higher duties than were paid by the Venetians. 4. That the

effets of any Florentine who died in the dominions of the
Soldan hould be consigned to the consul. 5. That the -gold
and silver coin of Florence should be received in payments.
All these privileges (which shew on what equal and liberal

TaE Eastern parts of Afa are now so completely explored,

that the firt imperfec accounts of them, by Marco Polo, attraa
little of that attention which was originally excited by the pub-
lication of his travels; and some circumstances in his narrative
have induced different authors to justify this negle&, by calling
in question the truth of what he relates, and even to afert that
he had never visited those countries which he pretends to de-
scribe. He does not, fay they, ascertain the position of any
one place, by specifying its longitude or latitude. He gives
names to provinces and cities, particularly in his description of
Cathay, which have no resemblance to those which they now
bear. We may observe, however, that as Marco Polo seems
to hare been, in no degree, a man of science, it was not to
be expeced that he lhould fix the pofiton of places with geo-
graphical accuracy. As he travelled through China, either in

4 the
23;

the suite of the great Khan, or in execution of his orders, it is
probable that the names which he gives to different provinces
and cities, are those by which they were known to the Tartars,
in whose service he was, not their original Chinese names.
Some inaccuracies which have been observed in the relation of his
travels, may be accounted for, by attending to one circumstance,
that it was not publilhed from a regular journal, which, per-
haps, the vicissitudes in his situation, during such a long series
of adventures, did not permit him to keep, or topreferve. It
was composed after his return to his native country, and chiefly
from recollection. But notwithstanding this disadvantage, his
account of those regions of the East, towards which my in-
quiries have been direRed, contains information with refpea
to several particulars, altogether unknown in Europe at that time,
the accuracy of which is now fully confirmed. I lhall mention
iome of these, which, though they relate to matters of no
great consequence, afford the heft proof of his having visited
there countries, and of his having observed the manners and
customs of the people with attention. He gives a diftind ac-
count of the nature and preparation of Sago, the principal article
of subsistence among all the nations of Malayan race, and he
brought the firfl specimen of this singular production to Venice,
Lib. ii. c. i6. He takes notice, likewise, of the general custom
of chewing Betel, and his description of the mode of preparing
it, is the fame with that flill in use. Ramus. Viaggi, i. p.55,
D. 56. B. He even descends into such detail as to mention the
peculiar manner of feeding horses in India, which fill conti-
nues. Ramus. p. 53. F. What is of more importance, we
learn from him, that the trade with Alexandria continued when

he

237

he travelled through India, to be carried on in the fame manner
as I conjecured it to have been in ancient times. The com-
modities of the East were, flill brought to the Malabar coast
by veftels of the country, and conveyed thence, together with
pepper, and other productions peculiar to that part of India,
by Chips which arrived from the Red Sea. Lib. iii. c. 27.
This, perhaps, may account for the superior quality which
Sanudo ascribes to the goods brought to the coast of Syria from
the Persian Gulf, above those imported into Egypt by the Red
Sea. The former were chosen and purchased in the places where
they grew, or where they were manufacured, by the merchants
of Persia, who fill continued their voyages to every part of
the East; while the Egyptian merchants, in making up their
cargoes, depended upon the assortment of goods brought to
the Malabar coast by the natives. To some persons in his own
age, what Marco Polo related concerning the numerous armies
and immense revenues of the Eastern princes, appeared so ex-
travagant, (though perfecly consonant to what we now know
concerning the population of China, and the wealth of In-
doftan,) that they gave him the name of Mje/r Marco Millioni.

I imagine, is not to be confidered as the usual commercial rate
of interest at that period, but as a voluntary and public-fpirited
effort of the citizens, in order to support their country at a
dangerous crisis. Of fuch'laudable exertions, there are fevcral
striking intfances in the history of the republic. In the year

Two fads may be mentioned as proofs of an extraordinary

extension of the Venetian trade at this period.-- . There
is in Rymer's Great Collection, a series of grants from the
kings of England, of various privileges and immunities to
Venetian merchants trading in England, as well as several
commercial treaties with the republic, which plainly indicate
a considerable increase of their tranfadions in that country.
These are mentioned in their order by Mr. Anderson, to whose
patient industry and found understanding, every person en-
gaged in any commercial research must have felt himself
greatly indebted on many occasions.--2. The efiablilhment
of a Bank by public authority, the credit of which was founded

on
240

on that of the state. In an age and nation so well acquaint-
ed with the advantages which commerce derives from the
inititution of banks, it is unnecessary to enumerate them.
Mercantile tranfations must have been numerous and extensive
before the utility of such an institution could be fully per-
ceived, or the principles of trade could be so fully understood
as to form the regulations proper for conducting it with success.
Venice may boast of having given the first example to Europe
of an eftabliliment altogether unknown to the ancients, and
which is the pride of the modern commercial system. The con-
ftitution of the bank of Venice was originally founded on such
just principles, that it has served as a model in the establishment
of banks in other countries, and the adminifttration of its affairs
has been conduced with so much integrity, that its credit has
never been lhaken. I cannot specify the precise year in which
the bank of Venice was established by a law of the State. An-

VWHEN we take a view of the form andpofition of the habitable

parts of Asia and Africa, we shall fee good reasons for confidering
the camel as the modi ueful of all the animals over which the in-
habitants of these great continents have acquired dominion. In
* th,fome of the most fertile diftri&s are separated from each other
by such exteniive tracts of barren sands, the feats of desolation
and drought, as seem to exclude the poflibility of communi-
cation between them. But as the ocean, which appears, at
irftl view, to be placed as an insuperable barrier between dif-
ferent regions of the earth, has been rendered, by navigation,
fubfervicnt to their mutual intercourse; so, by means of the
camel, which the Arabians emphatically call The Ship of the

13 Defcrt,

Di),rt, the most dreary waftes are travcrfed, and the nalioi;s
which they disjoin are enabled to trade with one another.
Those painful jourties, inmpradicable hy any other animal, the
camel performs with aflonihling diijatch. Under heavy
burdens of fix, seven, and eight hundred weight, they can
continue their march during a long period of time, with little
food or reft, and sometimes without taiing water for eight or
nine days. By the wife economy of Providence, the camel
seems formed of purpolf to be the beast of burden in those
regions where he is placed, and where his fcrvice is most
wanted. In all the diftrics of Alia and Africa, where deserts
arc most frequent and extensive, the camel abounds. This
is his proper flation, and beyond this the sphere of his ativity
does not extend far. He dreads alike the exccfles of heat and
of cold, and does not agree even with the mild climate of our
temperate zone. As the first trade in Indian commodities, of
which we have any authentic account, was carried on by means
of camel, Genesis, sXXvii. 25, and as it is by employing
them that the conveyance of there commodities has been so
widely extended over Asia and Africa, the particulars which I
have mentioned concerning this singular animal appeared to
me necelfary towards illustrating this part of my subjet. If
any of my readers desire more full information, and wifli to
know how the ingenuity and art of man have fccondcd the
intentions of Nature, in training the camel, from his birth, for
that life of exertion and hardflip to which he is deflined, lie
mnay consult Hiftoire Naturellc, by M. le Comte de Buflon,

jnl, as far as I can judge from examining the authorities

I i 2 which

243

which he has quoted, one of the most accurate, descriptions
given by that celebrated writer. M. Volney, whose accuracy
is well known, gives a description of the manner in which the
camel performs its journeys, which may be agreeable to some
of my readers. " In travelling through the desert, camels
" are chiefly employed, because they consume little, and carry
" a great load. His ordinary burden is about seven hundred
"and fifty pounds; his food, whatever is given him, straw,
"thistles, the flones of dates, beans, barley, &c. With a
" pound of food a day, and as much water, he will travel for
" weeks. In the journey from Cairo to Suez, which is forty

or forty-fix hours, they neither eat nor drink; but these

"long fals, if often repeated, wear them out. Their usual
"rate of travelling is very flow, hardly above two miles an
"hour; it is vain to push them, they will not quicken their

pace, but, if allowed some short reft, they will travel fifteen
"eighteen hours a day." Voyage, tom. ii. p. 383.

IN order to give an adequate idea of the extensive circula-

tion of Indian commodities by land carriage, it would be neceflary
to trace the route, and to estimate the number, of the various
caravans by which they are conveyed. Could this be executed
with accuracy, it would be a curious objet of geographical re-
search, as well as a valuable addition to commercial hiltbry.
Though it is inconsistent with the brevity which I have uni-
formly studied in conducting this Disquisition, to enter into a

detail
244

detail of so great length, it may be proper here, for illustrating
this part of my subje&t, to take such a view of two caravans
which visit Mecca, as may enable my readers to estimate more
juftlU the magnitude of their commercial tranfations. The
first is the caravan which takes its departure from Cairo in
Egypt, and the other from Damascus in Syria; and I feleft
there, both because they are the most considerable, and because
they are described by authors of undoubted credit, who had the
best opportunities of receiving full information concerning
them. The former is composed not only of pilgrims from every
part of Egypt, but of those which arrive from all the small Ma-
homedan fates on the African coast of the Mediterranean, from
the empire of Morocco, and even from the Negroe kingdoms on
the Atlantic. When assembled, the caravan consists at least
of fifty thousand persons, and the number of camels employed
in carrying water, provisions, and merchandize, is still greater.
The journey, which, in going from Cairo and returning thither,
is not completed in less than a hundred days, is performed
wholly by land; and as the route lies motly through sandy
deserts, or barren uninhabited wilds, which seldom afford any
subsistence, and where often no sources of water can be found,.
the pilgrims always undergo much fatigue, and sometimes must
endure incredible hardlhips. An early and good description of
this caravan is publilhed by Hakluyt, vol. ii. p. 20o, &c.
Maillet has entered into a minute and curious detail with re-
gard to it; Defcript. de l'Egypte, part ii. p. 212, &c. Po-
cock has given a route, together with the length of each day's
march, which he received from a person who had been four-
teen times at Mecca, vol. i. pp. 188, 261, &c.-The caravan

from

245

from D-mafcus, compolfed of pilgrims from al!nof every pro-
i.nce- cf the Turkish empire, is little infci,-r to the former in
r.um:r, and the commerce which it carries on is hardly less
vAluable. Voyage deVolney, tom. ii. p. 21, &c. This pil-
grimage was performed in the year 1741, by Khizeh Abdul-
kurreem, whom 1 formerly mentioned, Note IV. p. I86. He
gives the usual route from Damascus to Mecca, computed by
hours, the ccr.mon mrcde of reckoning a journey in the Eail
through countries little frequented. According to the most
moderate eltimate, the diltance between the two cities, by his
account, muff be above a thousand miles; a great part of the
journey is through a delert, and the pilgrims not only endure
much fatigue, hut are often exposed to great danger from the
wild Arabs. Memoirs, p. ii4, &c. It is a singular proof of
the predatory spirit of the Arabs, that although all their inde-
Ipendent tribes are zealous Mahomedans, yet they make no
Ilruple of plundering the caravans of pilgrims, while engaged
in performing one of the molt indispensable duties of their re-
ligion. Great as these caravans are, we muff not fippofe that
all the pilgrims who vilit Mecca belong to them ; such confi-
derable additions are received from the extensive dominions of
Persia, from every province of Indoftan, and the countries to
the East of it, from Abyssinia, from various flates on the
Southern coast of Africa, and from all parts of Arabia, that when
the whole are afLembled they have been computed to amount
to two hundred thousand. In some years the number is farther
increaied by finall hands of pilgrims from several interior pro-
vinces of Africa, the names and lituations of which are jult
Lbginning to be known in Europe. For this lat fad we are

indebted

indebted to the Afficiation for promoting the Discovery of the
Interior Parts of Africa, formed by some British Gentlemen
urpon principles so liberal, and with viesys so public-fpirited, as
do honour to thcmfelves and to their country. Proceedings,
&c. P. 174.

IN the Report of the Committee of the Privy Council on the

Slave Trade, other particulars are contained; and it appears that
the commerce carried on by caravans in the interior partsof Africa
is not only widely extended, but of considerable value. Besides
the great caravan which proceeds to Cairo, and is joined by Ma-
homedan pilgrims from every part of Africa, there are caravans
which have no object but commerce, which set out from Fez, Al-
giers, Tunis, Tripoli, and other States on the fca-coaft, and pe-
netrate far into the interior country. Some of them take no
less than fifty days to reach the place of their destination; and,
as the medium of their rate of travelling may be cltimated
at about eighteen miles a day, the extent of their journey may
be easily computed. As both the time of their out-set, and
their route, are known, they are met by the people of all the
countries through which they travel, who trade with them.
Indian goods of every kind form a considerable article in this
traffic, in exchange for which the chief commodity they can
give is Slaves. Part vi.

As the journeys of the caravans, which are purely commer-

cial, do not commence at stated seasons, and their routes vary
according to the convenience or fancy of the merchants of
whom they are composed, a description cannot be given of
them with the fame degree of accuracy. But by attending to

the

247

the accounts of some authors, and the occasional hints of others,
sufficient information may be gathered to satisfy us, that the
circulation of Eaflern goods by there caravans is very extensive.
The fame intercourse which was anciently kept up by the pro-
vinces in the North-east of Asia with Indofian and China, and
which I formerly described, flill fubifits. Among all the nu-
merous tribes of Tartars, even of those which retain their pas-
toral manners in greatest purity, the demand for the produc-
tions of these two countries is very considerable. Voyages de
Pallas, tom. i. p. 357, &c. tom. ii. p. 422. In order to supply
them with these, caravans set out annually from Boghar, (Hack-
luyt, vol.i. p. 332.) Samarcand, Thibet, and several other places,
and return with large cargoes of Indian and Chinese goods.
But the trade carried on between Russia and China in this part
of Asia is by far the moit extensive and best known. Some
conneftion of this kind, it is probable, was kept up between
them from the earliest period, but it increased greatly after the
interior parts of Russia were rendered more accessible by the
conquests of Zingis Khan and Tamerlane. The commercial
nations of Europe were so well acquainted with the mode of
carrying on this trade, that soon after the Portuguese had
opened the communication with the East by the Cape of Good
Hope, an attempt was made in order to diminifi the advantages
which they derived from this discovery, to prevail on the
Ruffians to convey Indian and Chinese commodities through
the whole extent of their empire, partly by land-carriage and
partly by means of navigable rivers, to some port on the Baltic,
from which they might be distributed through every part of
Europe. Ramufio Raccolto da Viaggi, vol. i. p. 374. B.

This scheme, too great for the monarch then on the throne of
Ruflia to carry into execution, was rendered practicable by
the conquests of Ivan Bafilowitz, and the genius of Peter the
Great. Though the capitals of the two empires were situated
at the immense distance of fix thousand three hundred and
feventy-eight miles from each other, and the route lay for
above four hundred miles through an uninhabited desert, (Bell's
Travels, vol. ii. p. 167.) caravans travelled from the one to
the other. But though it had been itipulated when this in-
tercourfe was eftablilhed, that the number of persons in each
caravan fhotild not exceed two hundred, and though they were
shut up within the walls of a Caravanserai during the short time
they remained in Pekin, and were allowed to deal only with a
few merchants, to whom a monopoly of the trade with them
had been granted; yet, notwithstanding all rhefe restraints and
precautions, the jealous vigilance with which the Chinese go-
vernment excludes foreigners from a free intercourse with its
fubjeas was alarmed, and the admission of the Ruffian cara-
vans into the empire was soon prohibited. After various ne-
gociations, an expedient was at length devised, by which the
advantages of mutual commerce were secured, without infring-
ing the cautious arrangements of Chinese policy. On the
boundary of the two, empires, two small towns were built
almost contiguous, the one inhabited by Ruffians, the other by
Chinese. To these all the marketable producions of their
refpecive countries are brought by the fubjeds of each em-
pire; and the furs, the linen and woollen cloth, the leather,
the glass, &c. of Russia, are exchanged for the silk, the cot-
ton, the tea, the rice, the toys, &c. of China. By sorn

K k well-

well-judged concessions of the sovereign now feated on the
throne of Rufia, whose enlarged mind is superior to the illi-
beral maxims of some of her predecessors, this trade is rendered
so flourilhing, that its amount annually is not lcfs than eight hun-
dred thouland pounds sterling, and it is the only trade with
China carried on almost entirely by barter. Mr. Coxe, in his
account of the Ruffian discoveries, has colleced, with his usual
attention and discernment, every thing relative to this branch
of trade, the nature and extent of which were little known in
Europe. Chap. ii. iii. iv. Nor is this the only place where
Russia receives Chinefie and Indian commodities. A confider-
able supply of both is brought by caravans of independent
Tartars to Orenburg, on the river Jaik, Voyage de Pallas,
tom. i. p. 3j5, &c. to Troitzkaia, on the river Oui, and to
other places which I might mention. I have entered into this
long detail concerning the mode in which the productions in
India and China are circulated through Rufia, as it affords the
most striking instance, I know, of the great extent to which
valuable commodities may be conveyed by land carriage.

THE only voyage of discovery in the Atlantic Ocean towards
the South, by any of the ancient commercial lfates in the Me-
diterranean, is that of Hanno, undertaken by order of the re-
public of Carthage. As the situation of that city, so much
nearer the Straits than Tyre, Alexandria, and the other feats
!50

of

of ancient trade which I have mentioned, gave it more imme-
diate access to the ocean; that circumfiance, together with the
various settlements which the Carthaginians had made in dif-
ferent provinces of Spain, naturally suggested to them this
enterprise, and afforded them the profpet of considerable ad-
vantages from its success. The voyage of Hanno, instead of
invalidating, seems to confirm the justness of the reasons which
I have given, why no similar attempt was made by the other
commercial Rates in the Mediterranean.

NOTE LIV. SECT. IV. p. 153.

THOUGH the intelligent authors whom I have quoted con-

fidered this voyage of the Phenicians as fabulous, Herodotus
mentions a circumstance concerning it, which seems to prove
that it had really been performed. " The Phenicians," fays he,
" affirmed that, in failing round Africa, they had the fun on
" their right hand, which to me appears not to be credible,
" though it may be deemed so by others." Lib. iv. c. 42.
This, it is certain, must have happened, if they really acconm-
plifhed such a voyage. The science of afronomy, however,
was in that early period so imperfect, that it was by experience
only that the Phenicians could come at the knowledge of this
fat; they durfi not, without this, have ventured to assert what
would have appeared to be an improbable fidion. Even after
what they related, Ilerodotus disbelieved it.

'NOTWITHSTANDING this increasing demand for the pro-

duations of India, it is remarkable, that during the sixteenth
century some commodities which are now the chief articles of
importation from the Eaf, were either altogether unknown, or
of little account. Tea, the importation of which, at present,
far exceeds that of any other producion of the East, has not
been in general ule, in any country of Europe, a full
century; and yet, during that Ihort period, from bome fin-
gular caprice of taste, or power of faflion, the infusion of
a leaf brought from the farthest extremity of the earth,
of which it is perhaps the highest praise to fay that it is
innoxious, has become almost a necessary of life in several
parts of Europe, and the paflion for it defends from the
most elevated to the lowest orders in society. In 1785 it
was computed that the whole quantity of tea imported into
Europe from China was about nineteen millions of pounds, of
which it is conjectured that twelve millions were consumed in
Great Britain and the dominions depending upon it. Dodley's
Annual Register for 1S74 and 1785, p. 56. The porcelane
of China, now as common in many parts of Europe as if it
were of domestic manufacture, was not known to the ancients.
ilarco Polo is the first among the moderns who mentions it.
The Portuguese began to import it not long after their first
voyage to China, A. D. 1517; but it was a considerable time
before the use of it became extensive.

SHALL now endeavour to fulfil an engagement which
I came under ', to make some observations upon the genius,

the manners, and inltitutions of the people of India, as far as
they can be traced from the earliest ages to which our know-
ledge of them extends. Were I to enter upon this wide
field with an intention of surveying its whole extent; were I to
view each object which it presents to a philosophical inquirer,
under all its different aspe&s, it would lead me into researches
and speculations, not only of immense length, but altogether
foreign from the fubjeft of this Disquisition. My inquiries and
reflections ihall therefore be confined to what is intimately con-
nesed with the design of this work. I lhall colle&t the fads

which

which the ancients have tranfinitted to us concerning the infli-
tutions peculiar to the natives of India, and, by comparing them
with what we know of that country, endeavour to deduce such
conclusions as tend to point out the circumstances which have
induced the reft of mankind, in every age, to carry on com-
mercial intercourse to so great an extent with that country.

OF this intercourse there are conspicuous proofs in the ear-

heft periods concerning which history affords information.
Not only the people contiguous to India, but remote nations,
seem to have been acquainted, from time immemorial, with its
commodities, and to have valued them so highly, that in order
to procure them they undertook fatiguing, expensive, and dan-
gerous journeys. Whenever men give a decided preference to
the commodities of any particular country, this must be owing
either to its possessing some valuable natural produ&ions pecu-
liar to its foil and climate, or to some superior progress which
its inhabitants have made in industry, art, and elegance. It is
not to any peculiar excellence in the natural productions of
India, that we must ascribe entirely the predile&tion of ancient
nations for its commodities; for, pepper excepted, an article, it
must be allowed, of great importance, they are little different
from those of other tropical countries; and Ethiopia or Arabia
might have fully supplied the Phenicians, and other trading
people of antiquity, with the spices, the perfumes, the precious
stones, the gold and silver, which formed the principal articles
of their commerce.

WHOEVER

WHOEVER then wishes to trace the commerce with India to

its source, must search for it, not so much in any peculiarity of
the natural productions of that country, as in the superior im-
provement of its inhabitants. Many saCs have been tranf-
mitted to us, which, if they are examined with proper at-
tention, clearly demnonftrate, that the natives of India were
not only more early civilized, but had made greater progress
in civilization than any other people. These I shall endea-
vour to enumerate, and to place them in such a point of
view as may serve both to throw light upon the institutions,
manners, and arts of the Indians, and to account for the
eagerness of all nations to obtain the productions of their in-
genious industry.

By the ancient Heathen writers, the Indians were reckoned

among those races of men which they denominated Autock-
thones or Aborigines, whom they confidered as natives of the
foil, whole origin could not be traced b. By the inspired
writers, the wisdom of the East (an expression which is to be
undcrftood as a description of their extraordinary progress in
science and arts) was early celebrated . In order to illustrate
and confirm there explicit tcftimonies concerning the ancient
and high civilization of the inhabitants of India, I Ihall take a
view of their rank and condition as individuals; of their civil
policy ; of their laws and judicial proceedings; of their useful
and elegant arts; of their sciences; and of their religious in-
Pfitutions; as far as information can be gathered from the ac-

counts

counts of the Gteek and Roman writers, compared with what
still remains of their ancient acquirements and institutions.

I. FROM the most ancient accounts of India we learn, that

the diftindion of ranks and separation of profelfions were
completely eftablilhied there. This is one of the most un-
doubted proofs of a society considerably advanced in its pro-
grefs. Arts in the early stages of social life are so few, and so
simple, that each man is sufficiently mailer of them all, to
gratify every demand of his own limited desires. A savage can
form his bow, point his arrows, rear his hut, and hollow his
canoe, without calling in the aid of any hand more skilful than
his own d. But when time has augmented the wants of men,
the produfions of art become so complicated in their ftruaure,
or so curious in their fabric, that a particular course of educa-
ton is requisite towards forming the artist to ingenuity in con-
trivance and expertness in execution. In proportion as refine-
ment spreads, the diflin&ion of profellions increases, and they
branch out into more numerous and minute fubdivilions.
Prior to the records of authentic history, and even before the
most remote ra to which their own traditions pretend to reach,
this separation of professions had not only taken place among
the natives of India, but the perpetuity of it was secured by
an institution which must be confidered as the fundamental
article in the system of their policy. The whole body of the
people was divided into four orders or casts. The members of
the firt, deemed the most sacred, had it for their province, to

study

study the principles of religion; to perform its fuaeions; and
to cultivate the sciences. They were the priets, the inftruaors,
and philosophers of the nation. The members of the second
order were entrusted with the government and defence of
the state. In peace they were its rulers and magitrates, in war
they were the soldiers who fought its battles. The third was
composed of hutbandmen and merchants; and the fourth
of artisans, labourers, and servants. None of there can ever
quit his own cast, or be admitted into another'. The station
of every individual is unalterably fixed; his defliny is irevor
cable; and the walk of life is marked out, from which he
must never deviate. This line of reparation is not only efta.
bliihed by civil authority, but confirmed and fantioned by
religion; and each order or cast is said to have proceeded from
the Divinity in such a different manner, that to mingle and
confound them would be deemed an a& of most daring in-
piety . Nor is it between the four different tribes alone that
fitch insuperable barriers are fixed; the members of each cast
adhere invariably to the profelfion of their forefathers. From
generation to generation, the fame families have followed, and
will always continue to follow, one uniform line of life.

Sucii arbitrary arrangements of the various members which

compose a community, seems, at first view, to be adverse to
improvement either in science or in arts; and by forming

aroundl

around ttdiferent -orders of men, artificial barriers, which it
would'i:hciprious to pass, tends to circumscribe the operations
es * si:nan mind within a narrower sphere than nature has
alloted to them. When every man is at full liberty to diret
his efforts towards those objecs and that end which the im-
pulse of his own mind prompts him to prefer, he may be ex-
peced to attain that high degree of eminence to which the
uncontrouled exertions of genius and industry naturally con-
dua. The regulations of Indian policy, with refpel to the
different orders of men, must necessarily, at some times, check
genius in its career, and confine to the fundions of an inferior
caR, talents fitted to lhine in an higher sphere. But the ar-
rangements of civil government are made, not for what is ex-
traordinary, but for what is common; not for the few, but for
the many. The objec of the first Indian legifators was to
employ the most effedual means of providing for the subsist-
ence, the security, and happiness of all the members of the
community over which they presided. With this view they
set apart certain races of men for each of the various profef-
sions and arts necessary in a well-ordered society, and appointed
the exercise of them to be transmitted from father to son in
succession. This lyRtem, though extremely repugnant to the ideas
which we, by being placed in a very different state of society,
have formed, will be found, upon attentive infpeaion, better
adapted to attain the end in view, than a careless observer is, on
a sirs view, apt to imagine. The human mind bends to the law of
necefiity, and is accuflomed, not only to accommodate itself to
the restraints which the condition of its nature, or the inflitu-
tions of its country, impose, but to acquiefle in them. From

5 Ihis

his entrance into life, art Indian knows the ftattoh,.allotted to
him, and the functions to which he is destined by his birth.
The objecs which relate to there are the first that present
themselves to his view. They occupy his thoughts, or employ
his hands; and, from his earliest years, he is trained to the
habit of doing with eale and pleasure that which he mull con-
tinue through life to do. To this. may be ascribed that high
degree of perfection conspicuous in many of the Indian manu-
factures; and -though veneration for the pracices of their an-
ceftors may check the spirit of invention, yet, by alhering
to these, they acquire such an expertness and delicacy of hand,
that Europeans, with all the advantages of superior fclence,
and the aid of more complete inftrumnents, have never been
able to equal the exquisite execution of their workmanship.
While this high improvement of their more curious manufac-
tures excited the admiration, and attracted the commerce, of
other nations, the separation of professions in India, and the
early diffribution of the people into classes, attached, to par-
ticular kinds of labour, secured such abundance of the
more common and useful commodities, as not only supplied
their own wants, but miniftcred to those of the countries
around them.

To this eaily division of tile people into casts, we muff like-

wife ascribe a firiking peculiarity in the Rate of India; the
permanence of its institutions, and the immutability in the
manners of its inhabitants. What now. is in Ih.dia, always was
there, and is likely lill to continue: neither the ferocious vio-
lencc and illiberal fanaticism of its Mahomedan conquerors, nor

the

26t

the power of its European masters, have effected any confider-
able alteration '. The fame diflineions of condition take place,
the fame arrangements in civil and domestic society remain, the
fame maxims of religion are held in veneration, and the fame
sciences and arts are cultivated. Hence, in all ages, the trade
with India has been the fame; gold and silver have uniformly
been carried thither in order to purchase the fame commodities
with which it now supplies all nations; and from the age of
Pliny to the present times, it has been always confidered and
execrated as a gulf which swallows up the wealth of every
other country, that flows incessantly towards it, and from which
it never returns'. According to the accounts which I have
given of the cargoes anciently imported from India, they
appear to have confited of nearly the fame articles with those
cf the invcftments in our own times; and whatever difference
we may observe in them seems to have arisen, not so much
from any diversity in the nature of the commodities which the
Indians prepared for sale, as from a variety in the taftes, or in
:he wants, of the nations which demanded them.

II. ANOTHER proof of the early and high civilization of the

people of India, may be deduced from confidering their political
constitution and form of government. The Indians trace back the
history of their owncountry through animmenfe succession of ages,
and alert, that all Asia, from themouth of the Indus on the weft, to
the confines of China on the eaf, and from the mountains of I hibet
on the north, to Cape Comorin on the south, formed a vast empire,

fuhjed to one mighty sovereign, under whom ruled several he-
reditary Princes and Rajahs. But their chronology, which mea-
fures the life of man in ancieht times by thousands of years, and
computes the length of the several periods, during which it
supposes the world to have existed, by millions, is so wildly ex-
travagant, as not to merit any serious discussion. We must reft
satisfied, then, until fomo more certain information is obtained
with refpec to the ancient history of India, with taking the firfl
accounts of that country, which can be deemed authentic, from
the Greeks, who served under Alexander the Great. They
found kingdoms of considerable magnitude established in that
country. The territories of Porus and of Taxiles-compre-
hended a great part of the Panjab, one of the most fertile and
best cultivated countries in India. The kingdom of the Prafij,
or Gandaridx, firetched to a great extent on both fides of the
Ganges. All the three, as appears from the ancient Greek
writers, were powerful and populous.

Tins description of the partition of India into flates of such

iagnitude, is alone a convincing proof of its having advanced far
in civilization. In whatever region of the earth there has been an
opportunity of observing the progress of men in social lile, they
appear at first in finall independent tribes or communities. Their
common wants prompt them to unite; and their mutual jea-
loulies, as well as the necessity of securing subsistence, compel
them to drive to a diflance every rival who might encroach on
those domains which they confider as their own. Many ages
claple before they coalefee, or acquire sufficient foresight to pro-
vide for the wants, or sufficient wisdom to condut the affairs of

x a numc-

263

a numerous society. Even under the genial climate, and in the
rich foil of India, more favourable perhaps to the union and
increase of the human species than any other part of the globe,
the formation of such extensive states, as were eftablified in
that country when firit viiited by Europeans, must have been a
work of long time; and the members of them mull have been
long accustomed to exertions of useful industry.

TIOUGH monarchical government was elfabliffied in all the

countries of India to which the knowledge of the ancients ex-
tended, the sovereigns were far from poffefling uncontrouled or
despotic power. No trace, indeed, is discovered there of any
asTembly or public body, the members of which, either in their
own right, or as representatives of their fellow-citizens, could
interpose in enating laws, or in superintending the execution
of them. Institutions deflined to assert and guard the rights
belonging to men in a social fiate, how familiar soever the idea
may be to the people of Europe, never formed a part of the
political conflitution in any great Asiatic kingdom. It was to
different principles that the natives of India were indebted for
reftritions which limiLed the esercife of regal power. The
rank of individuals was unalterably fixed, and the privileges of
the different calls were deemed inviolable. The monarchs of
India, who are all taken from the second of the four claffcs
formerly described, which is intrufied with the funilions of
government and exercifi of war, behold among their fil)jedls
an order of men far flperior to themselves indignity, and so con-
fious of their own pre-eminence, both in rank and in fandity,
that they would deem it degradation and pollution, if they

weare

were to eat of the fame food with their sovereign k. Their
pcrfons are sacred, and even for the moPt heinous crimes they
cannot be capitally punifled; their blood must never be shed '.
To men in this exalted flation monarchs must look up with
rcliect, and reverence them as the miniftcrs of religion, and
the teachers of wisdom. On important occasions, it is the duty
of fovcreigns to consult them, and to be direced by their
advice. Their admonitions, and even their censures, mufl be
received with submissive refpec. This right of the Brahmins
to offer their opinion with refpe& to the adminiflration of
public affairs was not unknown to the ancients"; and in some
accounts prelerved in India of the events which happened in
their own country, princes are mentioned, who, having vio-
lated the privileges of the cafls, and disregarded the remon-
firances of the Brahmins, were deposed by their authority, and
put to death".

\WHI\LE the sacred rights of the Brahmins opposcd a barrier

2gainfl the encroachments of regal power on one hand, it was
circumscribed on the other by the ideas which those who oc-
cupied the iigheft flations in society entertained of their own
dignity and privileges. As none but the members of the cast
next in rank to that which religion has rendered sacred, could
be employed in any funsion of the state, the sovereigns of the

extensive kingdoms anciently eftablifled in India, found
it necessary to entrust them with the superintendence
of the cities and provinces too remote to be under their
can immediate infpccion. In these stations they often ac-
9(;ired such wealth and influence, that offices conferred during
picalure, continued in their families, and they came gradually
to form an internediate order between the sovereign and his
fii;jcds; and by the vigilant jealousy with which they main-
t:.recd their own dignity and privileges, they constrained their
rulers to rcfpea them, and to govern with equity.

NoR were the benefits of there retfraints upon the power of

the sovereign confined wholly to the two superior orders in the
slate; they extended, in some degree, to the third class em-
ployed in agriculture. The labours of that numerous and use-
ful body of men are so essential to the preservation and happi-
ness of society, that the greatest attention was paid to render
their condition secure and comfortable. According to the ideas
which prevailed among the natives of India (as we arc in-
formed by the first Europeans who visited their country), the
sovereign is confidered as the sole universal proprietor of all the
land in his dominions, and from him is derived every species of
tenure by which his fubjeas can hold it. These lands were let
cut to the farmers who cultivated them, at a flipulated rent,
amounting usually to a fourth part of their annual produce paid
in kind . In a country where the price of work is extremely
low, and where the labour of cultivation is very inconfider-
able, the earth yielding its productions almoit spontaneously,.

where
266

where subsistence is amazingly cheap, where few clothes are
needed, and houses are built and furnilhed at little expence,
this rate cannot be deemed exorbitant or oppreflive. As long
as the huibandman continued to pay the eftabliflhed rent, he
retained possession of the farm, which descended, like pro-
perty, from father to son.

TIESE accounts given by ancient authors of the condition

and tenure of the renters of land in India, agree so perfectly
with what now takes place, that it may be confidered almost
as a description of the present slate of its cultivation. In every
part of India, where the native Hindoo Princes retain domi-
nion, the Ryots, the modern name by which the renters of
land are diftinguiihed, hold their possessions by a lease, which
may be confidered as perpetual, and at a rate fixed by ancient
surveys and valuations. This arrangement has been so long
eftablilhed, and accords so well with the ideas of the natives,
concerning the diflincions of casts, and the functions allotted
to each, that it has been inviolably maintained in all the pro- -
vinces subjed either to Mahomedans or Europeans; and, to
both, it serves as the bails on which their whole fyflem of
finance is founded P. In a more remote period, before the ori-
,inal inflitutions of India were filbverted by foreign invaders, the
industry of the husbandman, on which every member of the
community depended for fubfitelce, was as ccure as the tenure
by which he held his lands was equitable. EIecn war did not
interrupt his labours or endanger his property. It was not

iigliting a battla in one field, the peasants were ploughing or
reaping in the next field in perfet tranquillity q. These maxims
and regulations of the ancient legislators of India have a near
resemblance to the fy)tem of thole ingenious modern fpecu-
1 ters on politial c::onomn, who represent the produce of land
as the sole lource of wealth in every country ; and who con-
fider the difcoverv of this principle, according to which they
contend thit the government of nations flould be conducted,
as one of the greateil ecinrti of human wisdom. Under a
fcrm of government, which paid such attention to all the dif-
ferent orders of which the society is compoeed, particularly
the cultivators of the cartb, it is not wonderful that the ancients
ishould describe the Indians as a molt happy race of men; and
that the moRl intelligent modern obfcrvers fliould celebrate the
equity, the humanity, and mildness of Indian policy. A
l Iindoo Rajah, as I have been informed by persons well ac-

for securing its enjoyments and increasing them. Many ar-
rangements of this nature the Greeks, though accustomed to
their own institutions, the most perse& at that time in Europe,
observed and admired among the Indians, and mention them as
inltances of high civilization and improvement. There were
eftablilhed among the Indians three diftint classes of officers,
one of which had it in charge to infpea agriculture, and every
kind of country work. They measured the portions of
land allotted to each renter. They had the custody of the

nkZ's, or public reservoirs of water, without a regular dif-

tribution of which, the fields in a torrid climate cannot be
rendered fertile. They marked out the course of the high-
ways, along which, at certain distances, they erected flones,
to measure the road and direCt travellers r. To officers of a
second class was committed the infpeCion of the police in
cities, and their functions, of course, were many and various;
some of which only I shall specify. They appropriated houses
for the reception of firangers; they protected them from in-
jury, provided for their lubliftence, and, when seized with
any dileafe, they appointzd phylicians to attend them; and,
on the event of their death, they not only buried them with
decency, but took charge of their effecs, and restored them to
their relations. They kept exac registers of births and of
(l:thls. They vifted the public markets, and examined
vcights and incafures. The third class of officers fuperin-
tclled the military department; but, as the objels to which

inquiries, it is unnecessary to enter into any detail with re-
fpet to them'.

As manners and customs in India descend almost without

variation from age to age, many of the peculiar institutions
which I have enumerated still subsist there. There is still the
fame attention to the conftruaion and preservation of tanks,
and the diltribution of their waters. The direction of roads,
and placing flones along them, is still an ohjec of police.
Choultries, or houses built for the accommodation cf tra-
vellers, are frequent in every part of the country, and are
useful as well as noble monuments of Indian munificence and
humanity. It is only among men in the most improved slate of
society, and under the best forms of government, that we dif-
cover institutions similar to those which I have described; and
many nations have advanced far in their progress, without efla-
bliihing arrangements of police equally perfect.

III. IN estimating the progress which any nation has made

in civilization, the objef that merits the grcateft degree of at-
tention, next to its political constitution, is the spirit of the laws
and nature of the forms by which its judicial proceedings are
regulated. In the early and rude ages of society, the few
dilputes with rcfpect to property which arire, are terminated
1b the interpolition of the old men, or by the authority of
the chiefs in every finall tribe or community; their decisions
are dictated by their own discretion, or founded on plain and

obvious
2-70

obvious maxims of equity. But as controversies multiply, cafes
similar to such as have been formerly determined must recur,
and the awards upon these grow gradually into precedents,
which serve to regulate future judgments. Thus, long before
the nature of property is defined by positive itatutes, or any
rules prescribed concerning the mode of acquiring or conveying
it, there is gradually formed, in every state, a body of cuf-
tomary or common law, by which judicial proceedings are
directed, and every decision conformable to it is submitted to
with reverence, as the result of the accumulated wisdom and.
experience of ages.

IN this fate the administration of justice seems to have been

in India when firfl visited by Europeans. Though the Indians,
according to their account, had no written laws, but determined
every controverted point, by recolleaing what had been for-
merly decided'; they assert, that justice was dilpenfed among
them with great accuracy, and that crimes were most severely
punifled ". But in this general observation is contained all
the intelligence which the ancients furnish concerning the na-
ture and forms of judicial proceedings in India. From the
time of Megafthenes, no Greek or Roman of any note appears
to have resided long enough in the country, or to have been
so much acquainted with the customs of the natives, as to be
capable of entering into any detail with rclpc to a point of
so much importance in their policy. Fortunately, the defets
of their information have been amply supplicd by the more

accurate and extensive researches of the moderns. During the
course of amnofl three centuries, the number of persons who
have resorted from Europe to India has been great. Many
of them, who have remained long in the country, and were
persons of liberal education and enlarged minds, have lived in
such familiar intercourse with the natives, and acquired f6 com-
petent a knowledge of their languages, as enabled them to ob-
serve their institutions with attention, and to describe them with
fidelity. Refpeaable as their authority may be, I shall not, in
what I ofler for illustrating the judicial proceedings of the Hin-
doos, ref upon it alone, but shall derive my information from
luurtes higher and more pure.

ToWARDs the middle of the sixteenth century, Akber the

sixth, in descent from Tamerlane, mounted the throne of
Indoftan. He is one of the few sovereigns intitled to the appel-
lation both of Great and Good, and the only one of Maho-
medan race, whose mind appears to have rsen so far above all
the illiberal prejudices of that fanatical religion in which he
was educated, as to be capable of forming a plan worthy of a
monarch who loved his people, and was solicitous to render
them happy. As, in every province of his extensive domi-
nions, the Hindoos formed the great body of his subje&s, he
laboured to acquire a perfect knowledge of their religion, their
Iciences, their laws and inflitutions; in order that he might
conduct every part of his government, particularly the admi-
niftration of justice, in a manner as much accommodated as
possible to their own ideas '. In this generous undertaking he

was seconded with zeal by his vizier Abul Fazel, a minister
whole underRtanding was not less enlightened than that of his
master. By their afliduous researches, and consultation of
learned men , such information was obtained as enabled Abul
Fazel to publith a brief compendium of Hindoo jurisprudence
in the Ayecn Akbery , which may be confidered as the first
genuine communication of its principles to persons of a dif-
ferent religion. About two centuries afterwards, the illus- A.D.1773.
trious example of Akber was imitated and surpassed by Mr.
HaIfings, the Governor General of the Britifl Settlements in
India. By his authority, and under his infpetion, the most
eminent Pundits, or Brahmins learned in the laws, of the pro-
vinces over which he presided, were assembled at Calcutta;
and, in the course of two years, compiled, from their most an-
cient and approved authors, sentence by sentence, without ad-
dition or diminution, a full code of Hindoo laws ; which is,
undoubtedly, tho most valuable and authentic elucidation of
Indian policy and manners that has been hitherto communi-
cated to Europe.

ACCORDING to the Pundits, some of the writers upon whose

authority they found the decrees which they have inserted in
the Code, lived several millions of years before their time b; and
they boast of having a succession of expounders of their laws
from that period to the present. Without entering into any

examination of what is so extravagant, we may conclude, that
the Hindoos have in their poffefion treatises concerning the
laws and jurisprudence of their country, of more remote anti-
quity than are to be found in any other nation. The truth of
this depends not upon their own testimony alone, but it is put
beyond doubt by one circumltance, that all these treatises are
writtcn in the Samnreet language, which has not been
fpcken for many ages in any.part of Indoftan, and is now un-
derfRood by none but the mot learned Brahmins. That the
Ilindoos were a people highly civilized, at the time when their
laws were composed, is most clearly established by internal evi-
dence contained in the Code itself. Among nations beginning
to emerge from barlariim, the regulations of law are extremely
fminple, and applicable only to a few obvious cafes of daily
cc:urrcnce. Mlen must have been long united in a social Rtate,
their tranfacdions muff have been numerous and complex, and
judges must have determined an immense variety of contro-
xcrlies to which thie give rile, before the fyfcin of law be-
comes so voluminous and comprchenfive as to dired the judicial
proceedings of a nation far advanced in improvement. In that
early age of the Roman republic, when the laws of the Twelve
Tables were promulgated, nothing more was required than the
laconic injundions which they contain for regulating the deci-
lions of courts of justice; but, in a later period, the body of
civil law, ample as its contents are, was found hardly sufficient
for that purpose. To the jejune brevity of the Twelve Tables,
the Ilindoo Code has no resemblance, but with refped to the
number and variety of points it confiders, it will bear a conm-

parilon
274

parison with the celebrated digeit of Justinian; or with the
iyfteins of jurisprudence in nations moit highly civilized. The
articles of which the Hindoo Code is composed, are arranged in
natural and luminous order. They are numerous and compre-
henfive, and investigated with that minute attention and dif-
cernment which are natural to a people distinguished for acute-
ness and fubtility of understanding, who have been long ac-
customed to the accuracy of judicial proceedings, and ac-
quainted with all the refinements of legal pracice. The deci-
lions concerning every point (with a few exceptions occasioned
by local prejudices and peculiar cultons) are founded upon the
great and immutable principles ofjuttice wllich the human mind
ncknowledges and rclpects, in every age, and in all parts of the
earth. Whoever examines the whole work, cannot entertain a
dcubt of its containing the jurilirudilcce of an enlightened and
commercial people. Whoever looks into any particular title,
will be firprifed with a minutencfs of detail and nicety of dil-
tindion, which, in many inflanccs, fcem to go beyond the at-
tention of European Icgiflation ; and it is remarkah!e that finle
of the regulations which indicate the grcatcft degree of refine-
ment, were efltablifled in periods of the most remote anlitiuity.

" though it was not before the reign of Charles I. that our

Englilh jurisprudence fully admitted it in refpe& of maritime

"contrats '." It is likewise worthy of notice, that though the
natives of India have been distinguished in every age for the
humanity and mildnefi of their disposition, yet such is the so-
licitude of their law-givers to preserve the order and tranquillity
of society, that the punishments which they inflia on criminals,
are (agreeably to an observation of the ancients already men-
tioned) extremely rigorous. " Punishment (according to a striking
" personification in the Hindoo code) is the magistrate; pu-
" nifment is the inspirer of terror; punishment is the nou-
"rifher of the fubjeas; punishment is the defender from cala-
"mity; punilhment is the guardian of those that sleep; pu-
" nifhment, with a black afpe, and a red eye, terrifies
"the guilty ."

1V. As the condition of the ancient inhabitants of India,

whether we confider them as individuals, or as members of
society, appears, from the preceding investigation, to have
been extremely favourable to the cultivation of useful and ele-
gant arts; we are naturally led to enquire, whether the progress
which they aaually made in them, was such as might have been
expeced from a people in that situation. In attempting to trace
this progress, we have not the benefit of guidance equal to that
which conduced our researches concerning the former articles
of enquiry. The ancients, from their slender acquaintance

with
»76

with the interior state of India, have been able to communicate
little informatioti with refpe& to the arts cultivated there; and
though the moderns, during their continued intercourse with
India for three centuries, have had access to observe them with
greater attention, it is of late only, that by ftudving the lan-
guages now and formerly spoken in India, and by consulting
and translating their most eminent authors, they have begun to
enter into that path of enquiry which leads with certainty to a
thorough knowledge of the state of arts cultivated in that

country.

ONE of the sirs arts which human ingenuity aimed at ima-

proving, beyond what mere necessity requires, was that of
building. In the brief remarks which the fubje& of my in-
quiries leads me to make on the progress of this art in India, I
fliall confine my attention wholly to those of highest antiquity.
The most durable monuments of human industry are public
buildings. The producions of art, formed for the common
purpoles of life, waste and perish in using them; but works
defined for the benefit of posterity sublist through ages, and it
is according to the manner in which these are executed, that we
form a judgment with refped to the degree of power, lkill,
and improvement to which the people by whom they were
erected had attained. In every part of India monuments of
high antiquity are found. These are of two kinds, such as were
consecrated to the offices of religion, or fortrefnes built for the
security of the country. In the former of there, to which
Europeans, whatever their struCture may be, give the general
name of Pagodas, we may observe a diversity of Itile, which

both,

m77

both marks the gradual progress of architecture, and throws
light on the general slate of arts and manners in different pe-
riod.s. The moit early Pagodas appear to have been nothing
more than excavations in mountainous parts of the country,
formed probably in imitation of the natural caverns to which
the first inhabitants of the earth retired for safety during the
night, and wlere they found fielter from the inclemency of the
seasons. The most celebrated, and, as there is rcafon to be-
lieve, the most ancient of all these, is the Pagoda in the island
Elephanta, at no great distance from Bombay. It has been
hewn by the hands of man out of a solid rock, about half way
up a high mountain, and formed into a spacious area, nearly
120 feet square. In order to support the roof, and the weight
of the mountain that lies above it, a number of massy pillars,
and of a form not inelegant, have been cut out of tile fame
rock, at such regular ditaiicec, as on the first entrance presents
to the eye of the fpclator an appearance both of beauty and of
strength. Great part of the inside is covered with human
I;gures in high relief, of gigantic lize as well as singular forms,
and diftinguilhed by a variety of symbols, reprfi:nting, it is
probable, the attributes of the deities whom they worlhipped,
or the aaions of the heroes whom they admired. In the ilnc
of Silfette, still nearer to Bombay, are excavations in a similar
fii!c, hardly inferior in magnificence, and deftiled for the fame
religious purposes.

THESE stupendous works are of such high antiquity, that as

the natives cannot, either from history or tradition, give any
information concerning the time in which they were executed,

they
.-s

they universally ascribe the formation of them to the power of
fiperior beings. * From the extent and grandeur of there sub-
terraneous mansions, which intelligent travellers compare to the
most celebrated monuments of human power and art in any
part of the earth, it is manifest that they could not have been
formed in that stage of social life where men continue divided
into finall tribes, unaccustomed to the efforts of persevering in-
dultry. It is only in States of conGiderable extent, and among
people long habituated to subordination, and to act with con-
cert, that the idea of such magnificent works is conceived, or
the power of accomplilhing them can be found.

THIAT some filch powerful state was cflablifled in India at

the time when the excavations in the islands of Elephanta and
Sallette were formed, is not the only conclusion to be drawn
from a survey of them; the fiile in which the sculptures with
which they are adorned is executed, indicates a considerable im-
provelient in art at that early period. Sculpture is the imita-
tive art in which man seems to have made the firfi trial of his
own talents. But even in thole countries where it has attained
to the highest degree of perfection, its progress has been ex-
trcnmcly flow. Whoever has attended to the history of this art
in Greece, knows how fir removed the first rude eflhy to rc-
1 rcibnt the human form, was from any complete delineation of
it '. But the different groupes of figures which till remain
entire in the Pagoda of Elephanta, however low they must
rank if they be compared with the more elegant works of

AI* ~~~ Grecian

279

Grecian or even Etruscan artists, are finihied in a Rile confi.
derably superior to the hard inexpressive manner of the Egyp-
tians, or the figures in the celebrated palace of Persepolis. In
this light they have appeared to persons abundantly qualified to
appretiate their merit, and from different drawings, particularly
those of Niebuhr, a traveller equally accurate in observing, and
faithful in describing, we must form a favourable opinion of
the state of arts in India at that period.

IT is worthy of notice, that although several of the figures

in the caverns at Elephanta be so different from those now ex-
hibited in the Pagodas as objects of veneration, that some
learned Europeans have imagined they represent the rites of a
religion more ancient than that now eftablihed in Indofan,yet by
the Hindoos themselves the caverns are confidered as hallowed
places of their own worffip, and they fill resort thither to per-
form their devotions, and honour the figures there in the fame
manner with those in their own Pagodas. In confirmation of
this, I have been informed by an intelligent person, who visited
this subterraneous fanduary in the year 17S2, that he was accom-
panied-by a sagacious Brahmin, a native of Benares, who, though
he had never been in it before that time, was well acquainted
with the parentage, education, and life of every deity or human
figure there represented, and explained with fluency the mean-
ing of the various symbols by which the images were diftin-
guilhed. This may be confidered as a clear proof that the
fyflem of mythology now prevalent in Benares; is not different
from that delineated in the caverns of Elephanta. Mr. Hunter,
who visited Elephanta in the year 1784, seems to confider the

figures
28o

figures there as representing deities who are still objecs of wor-
lip among the Hindoos . One circumflance serves to confirm
the justness of this opinion. Several of the most conspicuous
personages in the groupes at Elephanta are decorated with the
Zennar, the sacred firing or cord peculiar to the order
of Brahmins, an authentic evidence of the difRinclion of
casts having been eltablilhed in India at the time when these
works were finished.

2. INSTEAD of caverns, the original places of worship, which

could be formed only in particular situations, the devotion of
the people soon began to raise temples in honour of their
deities in other parts of India. The ftruture of there was at
first extremely simple. They were pyramids of large dimen-
sion, and had no light within but what came from a small
door. After having been long accustomed to perform all the
rites of religion in the gloom of caverns, the Indians were natu-
rally led to confider the solemn darkness of such a mansion as
sacred. Some Pagodas in this first stile of building fill remain
in Indoftan. Drawings of two of these at Deogur, and of a
third near Tanjore in the Carnatic, all fabrics of great antiquity,
have been published by Mr. Hodges , and though they are
rude ftru&ures, they are of such magnitude as muff have required
the power of some considerable fiate to rear them.

3. IN proportion to the progress of the different countries of
India in opulence and refinement, the ftrudture of their temples

gradually

gradually improved. From plain buildings they became highly
ornamenited fabrics, and, both by their extent and magnificence,
a:e mconiments of the power and taste of the people by whom
they were ereced. In this highly finished stile there are Pa-

t .3s of great antiquity in different parts of Indoftan, particu-
larly in the Southern provinces, which were not exposed to the
deftruaive violence of Mahomedan zeal '. In order to assist
my readers in forming such an idea of there buildings as may
enable them to judge with refpedt to the early state of arts in
India, I ihall briefly describe two, of which we have the most
accurate accounts. The entry to the Pagoda of Chillambrum,
near Porto Novo, on the Coromandel coast, held in high vene-
ration on account of its antiquity, is by a stately gate under
a pyramid an hundred and twenty-two feet in height, built
with large stones above forty feet long, and more than five feet
square, and all covered with plates of copper, adorned with an
immense variety of figures neatly executed. The whole ftruc-
ture extends one thousand three hundred and thirty-two feet in
one direaion, and nine hundred and thirty-fix in another.
Some of the ornamental parts are finiihed with an elegance in-
titled to the admiration of the most ingenious artists'. The
Pagoda of Seringham, superior in fanCity to that of Chillam-
brum, surpasses it as much in grandeur; and, fortunately, I
can convey a more perfect idea of it by adopting the words of
an elegant and accurate historian. This Pagoda is situated about
a mile from the wefern extremity of the island of Seringham,
formed by the division of the great river Caveri into two

channels. " It is compored of seven square inclofures, one
" within the other, the walls of which are twenty-five feet ihigll,
" and four thick. These inclofures are three hundred and fifty feet
" distant from one another, and each has four large gates wvih a
"high tower; which are placed, one in the middle of each fide
"of the inclofure, and opposite to the four cardinal points. The
" outward wall is near four miles in circumference, and its gatc-
"way to the South is ornamented with pillars, several of which
"are single stones thirty-three feet long, and nearly five in
"diameter; and those which form the roof are still larger:
" in the inmost inclofures are the chapels. About half a mile
" to the East of Seringham, and nearer to the Caveri than the
" Coleroon, is another large Pagoda, called Jembikifma; but this
"has only one inclofure. The extreme veneration in which
" Seringham is held, arises from a belief that it contains that
" identical image of the god Wiftchnu, which used to be
"worlhipped by the god Brahma. Pilgrims from all parts of
" the peninfula.come here to obtain absolution, and none come
"without an offering of money; and a large part of the reve-

nue of the island is allotted for the maintenance of the Brah-

"mins who inhabit the Pagoda; and these, with their families,
" formerly composed a multitude not less than forty thousand

fouls, maintained, without labour, by the liberality of fu-

"perdition. Here, as in all the other great Pagodas of India,
" the Brahmins live in a Subordination which knows no refill-
" ance, and slumber in a voluptuoufnefs which knows no
" wants'."

TIll other species of public buildings which I mentioned,

were those erelcd for the defence of the country. From the
immense plains of Indofhn there arise, in different parts, emi-
nences and rocks formed by nature to be places of strength.
Of these the natives early took poffeflion, and fortifying them
with works of various kinds, rendered them almost impreg-
nable tations. There seems to have been in some distant
age, a period of general turbulence and danger in India,
when such retreats were deemed essentially necessary to public
safety; for among the duties of magifrates prescribed by the
Pundits, one is, ; that he fiall erect a strong fort in the place
" where he chufes to reside; and shall build a wall on all the

four fides of it, with towers and battlements, and shall make
a full ditch around it '." Of there fortresses several remain,

which, both from the appearance of the buildings, and from the
tradition of the natives, must have been conftruted in very
remote times. Mr. Hodges has publiihed views of three of
these, one of Chunar Gur, fituared upon the river Ganges,
about sixteen miles above the city of Benares ; the second, of
(;wallior, about eighty miles to the south of Agra'; the third
of Bidjegur, in the territory of Benares°. They are all, par-
ticularly Gwallior, works of considerable magnitude and ftrengtl.
The fortresses in Bengal, however, are not to be compared with
several in the Deccan. Affeergur, Burhampour, and Dowlata-
bad, are deemed by the natives to be impregnable P; and I am
assured, by a good judge, that Affeergur is indeed a mofl ftu-

pendous work, and so advantageously situated that it would be
extremely difficult to reduce it by force.

NOR is it only from surveying their public works that we are

jultified in aflerting the early proficiency of the Indians in ele-
gant and useful arts: we are led to form the fame conclusion by
a view of those produations of their ingenuity, which were the
chief articles of their trade with foreign nations. Of there the la-
bours of the Indian loom and needle have, in every age, been the
molt celebrated; and fine linen is conjecured, with some probabi-
lity, to have been called by the ancients Sindou, from the name of
the river Indus or Sindus, near which it waswroughtin the highest
perfecion'. The cotton manufacures of India seem anciently
to have been as much admired as they are at present, not only
for their delicate texture, but for the elegance with which some
of them are embroidered, and the beautiful colour of thc
flowers with which others are adorned. From the earliest pe-
riod of European intercourse with India, that country has been
diftinguilhed for the number and excellence of the fublfances
for dying various colours, with which it abounded '. The dye
of the deep blue colour in highest etimnation among the Romans
bore the name of Idircum '. From India too, the fubllance used
in dying a bright red colour, seems to have been imported ';

and it is vell known that both in the cotton and silk fluffs which
v.e now receive from India, the blue and the red are the colours
of mofl conspicuous luflre and beauty. But however much the
ancients may have admired these productions of Indian art,
some circumflances, which I have already mentioned, rendered
their demand for the cotton manufaaures of India, far inferior
to that of modern times; and this has occasioned the informa-
tion concerning them which .we receive from the Greek and
Roman writers to be very imperfect. We may conclude, how-
ever, from the wonderful resemblance of the ancient ltate of
India to the modern, that, in every period, the productions of
their looms were as various as beautiful. The ingenuity of the
Indians in other kinds of workmanship, particularly in metals
and in ivory, is mentioned with praise by ancient authors, but
without any particular description of their nature". Of these
early produaions of Indian artifls, there are now some fpeci-
mens in Europe, from which it appears that they were ac-
quainted with the method of engraving upon the hardest flones
and gems; and, both in the elegance of their designs and in
neatness of execution, had arrived at a considerable degree of
excellence. An ingenious writer maintains, that the art of en-
graving on gems was probably an Indian invention, and cer-
tainly was early improved there, and he supports this opinion
by several plausible arguments '. The Indian engraved gems,
of which he has publilhed descriptions, appear to be the work-

manship of a very remote period, as the legends on them are
in the Sanikreet language .

BUT it is not only from the improved state of mechanic arts

in India, that we conclude its inhabitants to have been highly
civilized; a proof of this, still more convincing, may be deduced
from the early and extraordinary produ&ions of their genius in
the fine arts. This evidence is rendered more interesting, by
being derived from a source of knowledge which the laudable
curiosity of our countrymen has opened to the people of
Europe within these few years. That all the science and litera-
ture pofseleed by the Brahmins, were contained inbooks written
in a language, underRood by a few only of the most learned
among them, is a saC which has long been known; and all the
Europeans fettled in India during three centuries, have com-
plained that the Brahmins obstinately refused to inftrun any
person in this language; But at length, by address, mild treat-
ment, and a persuasion, that the earnestness with which inftruc-
tion was solicited, proceeded not from any intention of turn-
ing their religion into derision, but from a desire of acquiring
a perfeft knowledge of their sciences and literature, their
scruples have been overcome. Several British gentlemen are
now completely masters of the Sanfkreet language. The myf-
terious veil, formerly deemed impenetrable, is removed; and,
in the course of five years, the curiosity of the public has been
gratified by two publications as singular as they were unex-

peded. The one is a tranlation, by Mr. Wilkins, of an
Episode from the Mababarat, an Epic poem, in high efti-
nation among the Hindoos, composed, according to their
account, by Kreefhna Dwypayen Veias, the most eminent of
all their Brahmins, above three thousand years before the Chris-
tian ara. The other is Sacontala, a dramatic poem, written
about a century before the birth of Christ, translated by Sir
William Jones. I shall endeavour to give my readers such
a view of the subjeC and composition of each of there, as
may enable them to estimate the degree of merit which they
poffTes.

THE Mahabarat is a voluminous poem, confifing of upwards

cf four hundred thousand lines. Mr. Wilkins has translated
more than a third of it; but only a short episode, intitled
Baghvat-Geeta, is hitherto published, and from this specimen
we must form an opinion with refpea to the whole. The
iulhjea of the poem is a famous civil war between two branches
of the royal house of Bhaurat. When the forces on each fide
were formed in the field, and ready to decide the contest by the
sword, Arjoon, the favourite and pupil of the god Kreefhna,
who accompanied him in this hour of danger, requetfed of him
to cause his chariot advance between the two hostile armies.
He looked at both armies, and beheld, on either fide, none
but grandsires, uncles, cousins, tutors, sons, and brothers, near
relations or bosom friends; and when he had gazed for a while,
and law thcfe prepared for the fight, he was seized with ex-
tieme pity and compunction, and uttered his sorrow in the
following words:-" Having beheld, O Krcerji.ca ! my kindred

" thus waiting anxious for the fight, my members fail me,
"my countenance withereth, the hair flandeth an end upon my
"body, and all my frame trembleth with horror! Even Gan-
" dev, my bow, efcapeth from mdy hand, and my skin is parched
"and dried up.-When I have destroyed my kindred, Ihall I
"longer look for happiness ? I wilh not for victory, KreeJn/a;
" I want not dominion; 1 want not pleasure ;.for what is do-
"minion and the enjoyments of life, or even life itself, when
" those for whom dominion, pleasure, and enjoyment were to
" be coveted, have abandoned life and fortune, and fland here

" grandsires and grandsons, uncles, nephews, cousins, kindred,
" and friends! Although they would kill me, I with not to
"fight them; no not even for the dominion of the three re-
"gions of the universe, much less for this little earth '." In
order to remove his scruples, Kreefhna informs him what was
the duty of a prince of the Chehteree, or military cast, when
called to act in such a situation, and incites him to perform it
by a variety of moral and philosophical arguments, the nature
of which I fiall have occasion to confider particularly in another
part of this Dissertation. In this dialogue between Kreefhna
and his pupil, there are several passages which give an high idea
of the genius of the poet. The speech ofArjoon I have quoted,
in which he expresses the anguih of his foul, muff have Tfruck every
reader as beautiful and pathetic; and I shall afterwards produce
a description of the Supreme Being, and ofthe reverence wherewith
he fiould be worshipped, which is sublime. But while these cx-

cite our admiration, and confirm us in the belief of a high degree
of civilization in that country where such a work was produced,
we are surprised at the defec of taste and of art in the manner
of introducing this Episode. Two powerful armies are drawn
up in battle-array, eager for the fight; a young hero and his
inmfrudor are described as standing in a chariot of war between
them; that surely was not the moment for teaching him the
principles of philosophy, and delivering eighteen lectures of
metaphysics and theology.

WITH regard, however, both to the dramatic and epic poetry

of the Hindoos, we labour under the disadvantage of being
obliged to form an opinion from a single specimen of each, and
that of the latter, too, (as it is only a part of a large work,) an
imperfe& one. But if, from such scanty materials, we may
venture upon any decision, it muRl be, that of the two, the
drama seems to have been conducted with the most corre0 taste.
This will appear from the obfenrations which I now proceed
to make upon Sacontala.

IT is only to nations considerably advanced in refinement, that

the drama is a favourite entertainment. The Greeks had been.
for a good time a poliihed people; Alc.us and Sappho had
composed their Odes, and Thales and Anaximander had opened
their schools, before Tragedy made its first rude essay in the cart
of Thespis; and a good time elapsed before it attained to any con-
fiderable degree of excellence. From the drama of Sacontala, then,
we must form an advantageous idea of the slate of improvement
in that society to whose taste it was suited. In estimating its merit,

however, we muff not apply to it rules of criticism drawn from the
literature and taste of nations with which its author was altoge-
ther unacquainted; we muff not expea the unities of the Greek
theatre; we muff not measure it by our own flandard of pro-
priety. -Allowance must be made for local customs, and lin-
gular manners, arising from a state of domeltic society, an order
of civil policy, and a fyiem of religious opinions, very differ-
ent from those established in Europe. Sacontala is not a regu-
lar drama, but, like some of the plays early exhibited on the
Spanish and English theatres, is an history in dialogue, un-
folding events which happened in diffrent places, and during
a series of years. When viewed in this light, the fable is in
general well arranged, the incidents are happily chosen, and
the vicissitudes in the situation of the principal personages are
sudden and unexpected. The unravelling of the piece, how-
ever, though some of the circumltances preparatory to it be
introduced with lkill, is at last brought about by the interven-
tion of superior beings, which has always a bad effect, and dif-
covers some want of art. But as Sacontala was descended of a
celestial nymph, and under the protection of a holy hermit,
this heavenly interposition may appear less marvellous, and is
extremely agreeable to the Oriental taste. In many places of
this drama it is simple and tender, in some pathetic; in others
there is a mixture of comic with what is more serious. Of each,
examples might be gi;en. I lhall seleCt a few of the first, both
because simplicity and tenderness are the charaeteriftic beauties
of the piece, and because they so little resemble the extravagant
imagery and turgid style of Oriental poetry.

SACONTALA,

SACONTALA, the heroine of the drama, a princess of high

binh, had been educated by an holy hermit in a hallowed
grove, and had passed the early part of her life in rural occu-
pations and pastoral innocence. When fie was about to quit
this beloved retreat, and repair to the court of a great monarch,
to whom she had been married, Cana, her fofter-father, and
her youthful companions, thus bewail their own loss, and ex-
press their wifses for her happiness, in a firain of sentiment and
language perfealy suited to their palloral characer.

SACONTALA, just as the was departing from the grove,

turns to Cana: " Suffer me, venerable father! to address
this Madhavi-crecper, whose red blossoms inflame the grove."

FROM this specimen of the Indian drama, every reader of

good tafe, I (hould imagine, will be satisfied, that it is only
among a people of polished manners and delicate sentiments
that a composition so simple and correc could be produced or
relished. I observe one inflance in this drama of that wild
extravagance so frequent in Oriental poetry. The monarch,
in replacing a bracelet wilich had dropped from the arm of
Sacontala, thus addresses her: " Look, my darling, this is the
" new moon which left the firmament in honour of superior
"beauty, and having descended on your enchanting wrist,

hath joined both its horns round it in the ihape of a

"bracelet'." But this is the speech of an enraptured young
man to his miflrefs, and in every age and nation exaggerated
praise is expeded from the mouth of lovers. Dramatic
exhibitions seem to have been a favourite amusement of
the Hindoos as well as of other civilized nations. " The
"tragedies, comedies, farces, and musical pieces of the In-

dian theatre, would fill as many volumes as that of any

" nation in ancient or modem Europe. They are all in verse
" where the dialogue is elevated, and in prose where it is
"familiar; the men of rank and learning are represented
" speaking pure Sanfcrit, and the women Pracrit, which is
"little more than the language of the Brahmins, melted down
* by a delicate articulation to the softness of Italian; while the

V. THE attainments of the Indians in science, furnilh an

additional proof of their early civilization. By every person
who has visited India in ancient or modern times, its inhabi-
tants, either in tranfadions of private business, or in the con-
duct of political affairs, have been deemed not inferior to the
people of any nation in sagacity, acuteness of understanding,
or address. From the application of such talents to the cultiva-
tion of science, an extraordinary degree of proficiency might have
been expected. The Indians were, accordingly, early celebrated
on that account, and some of the most eminent of the Greek
philosophers travelled into India, that, by converting with the
fages of that country, they might acquire some portion of the
knowledge for which they were diltinguiihed '. The accounts,
however, which we receive from the Greeks and Romans, of
the sciences which attracted the attention of the Indian philo-
fophers, or of the discoveries which they had made in them,
are very imperfet. To the researches of a few intelligent
persons, who have visited India during the course of the three
last centuries, we are indebted for more ample and authentic
information. But from the reluctance with which the Brah-
mins communicate their fcienccs to Itrangers, and the inability
of Europeans to acquire much knowledge of them, while, like
the mysterics of their religion, they were concealed from vul-

gar eyes in an unknown tongue, this information was acquired
slowly and with great difficulty. The fame observation, how-
ever, which I made concerning our knowledge of the state of
the fine arts among the people of India, is applicable to that of
their prQgrefs in science, and the present age is the .firR fur-
nilhed with sufficient evidence upon which to found a decisive
judgment with refpe& to either.

SCIENCE, when viewed as disjoined from religion, the con-

fideration of which I reserve for another head, is employed in
contemplating either the operations of the underfianding, the
exercise cf our moral powers, or the nature and qualities of
external objeas. The first is denominated logic; the second
ethics; the third physics, or the knowledge of nature. With
refpea to the early progress in cultivating each of these sciences
in India, we are in poffeflion of fads which merit attention.

BUT, prior to the consideration of them, it is proper to exa-

mine the ideas of the Brahmins with refpeC to mind itself,
for if these were not just, all their theories concerning its ope-
rations must have been erroneous and fanciful. The diflindion
between matter and spirit appears to have been early known by
the philosophers of India, and to the latter they ascribed many
powers, of which they deemed the former to be incapable;
and when we recollec how inadequate our conceptions arc
of every object that does not fall under the cognizance of the
fcnfes, we may affirm (if allowance be made for a peculiar no-
tion of the Hindoos which ihall be afterwards explained) that
no defiription of the human foul is more suited to the dignity

of
S96

of its nature than that given by the author of the Mahabarat.
"Some," fays he, " regard the foul as a wonder, others hear
" of it with aftoniUhment, but no one knoweth it. The wea-
" pon divideth it not; the fire burneth it not; the water cor-
"rupteth it not; the wind drieth it not away; for it is indi-
" ifible, inconsumable, incorruptible; it is eternal, universal,
"permanent, immovable; it is invisible, inconceivable, and
"unalterable'." After this view of the sentiments of the
Brahmins concerning mind itself, we may proceed to con-
fider their ideas with refped to each of the sciences, in that
tripartite arrangement which I mentioned.

if, Looic and Metaphysics. On no fubje& has the hu-

man underltanding been more exercised than in analysing its
own operations. The various powers of the mind have been
examined and defin6d, The origin and progress of our ideas
have been traced; and proper rules have been prescribed, of
proceeding from the observation of fads to the eftablilhment of
principles, or from the knowledge of principles to form ar-
rangements of science. The philosophers of ancient Greece
were highly celebrated for their proficiency in there abstruse
speculations; and, in their difcufilons and arrangements, disco-
vered such depth of thought, and acuteness of discernment,
that their systems of Logic, particularly that of the Peripa-
tetick School, have been deemed most diftinguimhed efforts of
human reason.

BUT

BUT since we became acquainted, in some degree, with the

literature and science of the Hindoos, we find that as soon as
men arrive at that stage in social life, when they can turn their
attention to speculative inquiries, the human mind will, in every
region of the earth, display nearly the fame powers, and pro-
ceed in its investigations and discoveries by nearly similar Reps.
From Abul Fazel's compendium of the philosophy E of the Hin-
doos, the knowledge of which he acquired, as he informs us,
by associating intimately with the most learned men of the
nation; from the specimen of their logical discussions contained
in that portion of the Shafter published by Colonel Dow h, and
from many passages in the Baghvat-Geeta, it appears that the
fame speculations which occupied the philosophers of Greece
had engaged the attention of the Indian Brahmins; and the
theories of the former, either concerning the qualities of external
objets, or the nature of our own ideas, were not more inge-
nious than those of the latter. To define with accuracy, to
distinguish with acuteness, and to reason with subtlety, are
charaderiftics of both; and in both, the fame excess of refine-
ment, in attempting to analyse those operations of mind which
the faculties of man were not formed to comprehend, led some-
times to the most false and dangerous conclusions. That fcep-
tical philosophy, which denies the existence of the material
world, and asserts nothing to be real but our own ideas, seems
to have been known in India as well as in Europe' ; and the
fages of the East, as they were indebted to philosophy for the

knowledge of many important truths, were not more exempt

2d, ETHICS. This science, which has for its objea, to afcer-

tain what distinguishes virtue fromvice, to investigate what motives

ihould prompt men to a&, and to prescribe rules for the con-
dud of life, as it is of all other the most interesting, seems to have
deeply engaged the attention of the Brahmins. Their sentiments
with refpett to these points werevarious, and, like the philosophers
of Greece, the Brahmins were divided into fe&s, diftinguified
by maxims and tenets often diametrically opposite. That sea with
whose opinions we are, fortunately, best acquainted, had efta-
bliihed a system of morals, founded on principles the most ge-
nerous and dignified which unaflifted reason is capable of dif-
covering. Man, they taught, was formed, not for speculation
or indolence, but for a&tion. He is born, not for himself
alone, but for his fellow men. The happiness of the society
of which he is a member, the good of mankind, are his ulti-
mate and highest objects. In chufing what to prefer or to
reject, the justness and propriety of his choice are the only con-
fiderations to which he fliould attend. The events which may
follow his actions are not in his own power, and whether thcy
be prosperous or adverse, as long as he is satisfied with the pu-
rity of the motives which induced him to a&, he can enjoy
that approbation of his own mind, which conftitutcs genuine
happiness, independent of the power of fortune or the opinions
of other men. " Man (fays the author of the Mahabarat)
" enjoyeth not freedom from ation. Every man is involun-
" tarily urged to at by those principles which are inherent in

Q(q 2 " his

". his nature. He who reitraineth his active faculties, and fitr
" teth down with his mind attentive to the objects of his
" senses, may be called one of an astrayed foul. The man is
"praised, who having subdued all his paflions, performeth
' with his acaive faculties all the funtions of life unconcerned

about the event . Let the motive be in the deed, and not

" in the event. Be not one whose motive for aalion is the
" hope of reward. Let not thy life be spent in inaaion.
"Depend upon application, perform thy duty, abandon all
"thought of the consequence, and make the event equal,
"whether it terminate in good or in evil; for such an equality
" is called Yog [i. e. attention to what is spiritual]. Seek an
"asylum then in wisdom alone; for the miserable and unhappy
"are so on account of the event of things. Men who are
"endued with true wisdom are unmindful of good or evil in
" this world. Study then to obtain this application of thy

underifanding, for such application in business is a precious
art. Wife men who have abandoned all thought of the fruit

"which is produced from their ations, are freed from the
" chains of birth; and go to the regions of eternal hap-
" pinefi'."

FROM these, and other paftages which I might have quoted,

we learn that the distinguishing dotrines of the Stoical School
were taught in India many ages before the birth of Zeno, and
inculcated with a persuasive earneftneis nearly resembling that
of Epidetus; and it is not without astonishment that we find
the tenets of this manly active philosophy, which seem to be

gentleness of their disposition than for the elevation of their
minds.

3d, PaysIcs. In all the sciences which contribute towards

extending our knowledge of nature, in mathematics, mecha-
nics, and astronomy, Arithmetic is of elementary use. In
whatever country then we find that such attention has been
paid to the improvement of arithmetic as to render its opera-
tions most easy and corret, we may presume that the sciences
depending upon it have attained a superior degree of perfecion.
Such improvement of this science we find in India. While,
among the Greeks and Romans, the only method used for the
notation of numbers was by the letters of the alphabet, which
necessarily rendered arithmetical calculation extremely tedious
and operose, the Indians had, from time immemorial, employed
for the fame purpose the ten cyphers, or figures, now universally
known, and by means of them performed every operation in
arithmetic with the greatest facility and expedition. By the
happy invention of giving a different value to each figure ac-
cording to its change of place, no more than ten figures are
needed in calculations the most complex, and of any given
extent; and arithmetic is the most perfect of all the sciences.
The Arabians, not long after their settlement in Spain, intro-
duced this mode of notation into Europe, and were candid
enough to acknowledge that they had derived the knowledge
of it from the Indians. Though the advantages of this mode
of notation are obvious and great, yet so slowly do mankind

2 adopt

adopt newinventions, that the use of it was for some time confined
to science; by degrees, however, men of business relinquished
the former cumbersome method of computation by letters, and
the Indian arithmetic came into general use throughout Eu-
rope . It is now so familiar and simple, that the ingenuity
of the people, to whom we are indebted for the invention, is
!ess observed and less celebrated than it merits.

THE Astronomy of the Indians is a proof still more confpi-

cuous of their extraordinary progress in science. The atten-
tion and success with which they studied the motions of the
heavenly bodies were so little known to the Greeks and Romans
that it is hardly mentioned by them but in the most cursory
manner'. But as soon as the Mahomedans eftablilhed an in-
tercourfe with the natives of India, they observed and celebrated
the superiority of their astronomical knowledge. Of the Eu-
ropeans who visited India after the communication with it by
the Cape of Good Hope was discovered, M. Bernier, an in-
quifitive and philosophical traveller, was one of the first who
learned that the Indians had long applied to the fludy of
astronomy, and had made considerable progress in that science .
His information, however, seems to have been very general
and imperfect We are indebted for the first fcicntific proof of
the great proficiency of the Indians in astronomical knowledge,
toM.delaLouberc, who,on his return from his embassy to Siam,

brought with him an extract from a Siamese manuscript, which A. D. 1687.
contained tables and rules for calculating the places of the fun
and moon. The manner in which these tables were conftruaed
rendered the principles on which they were founded extreme-
ly obscure, and it required a commentator as conversant in
altronomical calculation as the celebrated Caflini, to explain the
meaning of this curious fragment. The epoch of the Siamese
tables corresponds to the 2 ft of March, A. D. 638. Another
set of tables was transmitted from Chrifnabouram, in the Car-
natic, the epoch of which answers to the loth of March,
A. D. 1491. A third set of tables came from Narfapour, and the
epoch of them goes no farther back than A. D. 1S69. The
fourth and most curious set of tables was published by M. le
Gentil, to whom they were communicated by a learned Brah-
min of Tirvalore, a small town on the Coromandel coast,
about twelve miles weft of Negapatam. The epoch of these
tables is of high antiquity, and coincides with the beginning of
the celebrated xra of the Calyougham or Collee Jogue, which
commenced, according to the Indian account, three thou-
sand one hundred and two years before the birth of
Christ P.

THESE four fcts of tables have been examined and compared

by M. Bailly, who with singular felicity of genius has con-
joined an uncommon degree of eloquence with the patient re-
searches of an astronomer, and the profound investigations of
a geometrician. His calculations have been verified, and his
rcafonings have been illustrated and extended by Mr. Playfair,

INSTEAD of attempting to follow them in reasonings and

calculations, which, from their nature, are often abstruse and
intricate, I ihall satisfy ryfelf with giving such a general
view of them as is suited to a popular work. This, I hope,
may convey a proper idea of what has been published concern-
ing the astronomy of India, a subje&t too curious and impor-
tant to be omitted in any account of the fiate of science in that
country; and, without interposing any judgment of my
own, I lhall leave each of my readers to form his own
opinion.

IT may be confidered as the general result of all the inqui-

ries, reasonings, and calculations, with refpea to Indian aftro-
nomy, which have hitherto been made public, " That the
"motion of the heavenly bodies, and more particularly their
" situation at the commencement of the different epochs to
" which the four sets of tables refer, are ascertained with
"great accuracy; and that many of the elements of their cal-
"culations, especially for very remote ages, are verified by an
' aftonilhing coincidence with the tables of the modern aftro-
"nomy of Europe, when improved by the latest and most nice
"deductions from the theory of gravitation." These conclusions
are rendered peculiarly interesting, by the evidence which they
afford of an advancement in science unexampled in the history

of rude nations. The Indian Brahmins, who annually circu-
late a kind of almanack, containing astronomical predictions
of some of the more remarkable phenomena in the heavens,
such as the new and full moons, the eclipses of the fun and
moon, are in possession of certain methods of calculation,
which, upon examination, are found to involve in them a very
cxtenfive system of astronomical knowledge. M. le Gentil, a
French astronomer, had an opportunity, while in India, of ohb
serving two eclipses of the moon, which had been calculated
by a Brahmin, and he found the error in either to be very in-
considerable.

THE accuracy of these results is less surprising than the just-

ness and scientific nature of the principles on which the tables,
by which they calculate, are conftrucRed. For the method of
prediaing eclipses which is followed by the Brahmins, is of a
kind altogether different from any that has been found in the
possession of rude nations in the infancy of astronomy.
In Chaldea, and even in Greece, in the early ages,
the method of calculating eclipses was founded on the obfer-
vation of a certain period or cycle, after which the eclipses of
the fun and moon return nearly in the fame order; but there
was no attempt to analyse the different circumstances on which
the eclipse depends, or to deduce its phenomena from a precise
knowledge of the motions of the fun and moon. This last
was reserved for a more advanced period, when geometry, as
well as arithmetic were called in to the afliftance of astronomy,
and if it was attempted at all, seems not to have been attempted
with success before the age of Hipparchus. It is a method of

R r this

305

this superior kind, founded on principles, and on an analysis
of the motions of the fun and moon, which guides the calcu-
lations of the Brahmins, and they never employ any of the
grofler estimations, which were the pride of the sirs afirono-
mers in Egypt and Chaldsea.

THE Brahmins of the present times are guided in their cal-

culations by there principles, though they do not now under-
tand them; they know only the use of the tables which are in
their pofleffion, but are unacquainted with the method of
their conftrution. The Brahmin who visited M. le Gentil
at Pondicherry, and inftruted him in the use of the Indian
tables, had no knowledge of the principles of his art, and dif-
covered no curiosity concerning the nature of M. le Gentil's ob-
fcrvations, or about the instruments which he employed. He
was equally ignorant with refpe& to the authors of there tables;
and whatever is to be learnt concerning the time or place of their
conftrudion, must be deduced from the tables themselves. One
set of these tables (as was formerly observed) profess to be as
old as the beginning of the Calyougham, or to go back to the
year 3102 before the Christian ara; but as nothing (it may be
fuppored) is easier thanforan astronomer to give to his tables what
date he pleases, and, by calculating backwards, to eftablilh an
epoch of any afligned antiquity, the pretcnfions of the Indian
alronomy to so remote an origin are not to be admitted
I ithout examination.

Tni AT examinationhasaccordingly beeninflituted by M. Bailly,
and the result of his inquiries is asserted to be, that the aRro-

nomy
3o6

nomy of India is founded on obervations which cannot be of
a much later date than the period above mentioned. For the
Indian tables represent the slate of the heavens at that period
with astonishing exadnefs; and there is between them and the
calculations of our modern astronomy such a conformity, with
refpec to those ages, as could result from nothing, but
from the authors of the former having accurately copied from
nature, and having delineated truly the face of the heavens, in
the age wherein they lived. In order to give some idea of
the high degree of accuracy in the Indian tables, I ihall felec
a few instances of it, out of many that might be produced.
The place of the fun for the astronomical epoch at the begin-
ning of the Calyougham, as flated in the tables of Tirvalore, is
only forty-feven minutes greater than by the tables of M. de la
Caille, when corrected by the calculations of M. de la Grange.
The place of the moon, in the fame tables, for the fame epoch,
is only thirty-feven minutes different from the tables of Mayer.
The tables of Ptolemy, for that epoch, are erroneous no
less than ten degrees with refped to the place of the fun, and
eleven degrees with refpee to that of the moon. The accele-
ration of the moon's motion, reckoning from the beginning of
the Calyougham to the present time, agrees, in the Indian ta-
bles, with those of Mayer to a single minute. The inequality
of the fun's motion, and the obliquity of the ecliptic, which
were both greater in former ages than they are now, as repre-
sented in the tables of Tirvalore, are almost of the precise
quantity that the theory of gravitation alligns to them three
thousand years before the Chriflian xra. It is accordingly for
those very remote ages (about 5ooo years distant from the

R r z present)

3o7

present) that their astronomy is most accurate, and the nearer
we come down to our own times, the conformity of its results
with ours diminishes. It seems reasonable to suppose, that the
time when its rules are most accurate, is the time when the ob-
servations were made on which these rules are founded.

IN support of this conclusion, M. Bailly maintains that

none of all the afronomical fyflems of Greece or Persia, or of
Tartary, from some of which it might be fufpeCed that the
Indian tables were copied, can be made to agree with them,
especially when we calculate for very remote ages. The fupe-
rior perfecion of the Indian tables becomes always more con-
fpicuous as we go farther back into antiquity. This shews,
likewise, how difficult it is to conftrud any astronomical tables,
which will agree with the state of the heavens for a period so
remote from the time when the tables were conftruded, as four
or five thoufiand years. It is only from agtronomy in its most
advanced state, such as it has attained in modern Europe, that
such accuracy is to be expeced.

WHEN an estimate is endeavoured to be made of the geome-

trical ikill necessary for the conffruAion of the Indian tables and
rules, it is found to be very considerable; and, beside the know-
ledge of elementary geometry, it mufft have required plain and
spherical trigonometry, or fomethingequivalent to them, together
with certain methods of approximating to the values of geo-
metrical magnitudes, which seem to rife very far above the
elements of any of those sciences. Some of these last mark
also very clearly (although this has not been observed by M.

Bally)
30S

Bailly) that the places to which these tables are adapted, must
be situated between the Tropics, because they are altogether in-
applicable at a greater distance from the Equator.

FRO M this long indu&ion, the conclusion which seems obviously

to result is, that the Indian astronomy is founded upon obferva-
tions which were made at a very early period; and when we
confider the exat agreement of the places which they assign to
the fun and moon, and other heavenly bodies, at that epoch,
with those deduced from the tables of De la Caille and Mayer,
it strongly confirms the truth of the position which I have been
endeavouring to eftablifl, concerning the early and high state of
civilization in India.

BEFORE I quit this subjec1, there is one circumflance which

merits particular attention. All the knowledge which we have
hitherto acquired of the principles and conclusions of Indian
astronomy is derived from the southern part of the Carnatic,
and the tables are adapted to places situated between the meri-
dian of Cape Comorin and that which pafles through the
eaflern part of Ceylon '. The Brahmins in the Carnatic ac-
knowledge that their science of astronomy was derived from the
North, and that their method of calculation is denominated
Fakiam, or New, to distinguish it from the Siddantam, or an-
cient method eftablilhed at Benares, which they allow to be
much more perfec; and we learn from Abul Fazel, that all the
astronomers of Indoftan rely entirely upon the precepts con-

taied in a book called Soorej Sudbant, composed in a very re-
mote period '. It is manifefly from this book that the method
to which the Brahmins of the South gave the name of Siddan-
tam is taken. Benares has been from time immemorial the
Athens of India, the residence of the most learned Brahmins,
and the feat both of science and literature. There, it is highly
probable, whatever remains of the ancient astronomical know-
ledge and discoveries of the Brahmins is fill preserved'. In
an enlightened age and nation', and during a reign distinguished
by a succession of the most splendid and successful undertakings
to extend the knowledge of nature, it is an obje& worthy of
public attention, to take measures for obtaining possession of all
that time has spared of the pl:ilofophy and inventions of the
most early and most highly civilized people of the East. It is
with peculiar advantages Great Britain may engage in this laud-
able undertaking. Benares is subjea to its dominion; the con-
lidence of the Brahmins has been so far gained as to render
them communicative; some cf our countrymen are acquainted
\vith that sacred language in which the mysterics both of reli-
gion and of science are recorded; movement and activity has
been given to a spirit of inquiry throughout all the British
eftablilhments in India; persons who visited that country with
other views, though engaged in occupations of a very different
kind, are now carrying on scientific and literary researches with
ardour and success. Nothing seems now to be wanting but that
those entrusted with the administration of the Britili empire in

rality of sentiment, of investigating and explaining the more ab-
ftrufe parts of Indian philosophy, to devote his whole time to that
important objet. Thus Great Britain may have the glory of
exploring fully that extensive field of unknown science, which
the Academicians of France had the merit of first opening to
the people of Europe u.

VI. TIHE last evidence which I fliall mention of the early and

high civilization of the ancient Indians, is deduced from the con-
fideration of their religious tenets and pratices. The institutions
of religion, publicly established in all the extensive countries
tfretching from the Banks of the Indus to Cape Comorin, pre-
sent to view an aspec nearly similar. They form a regular and
complete system of fuperltition, strengthened and upheld by
every thing which can excite the reverence and secure the attach-
ment of the people. The temples, consecrated to their deities,
are magnificent, and adorned not only with rich offerings,
but with the molf exquisite works in painting and sculpture,
which the artists, highefl in estimation among them, were ca-
pable of executing. The rites and ceremonies of their worship
are pompous and splendid, and the performance of them not
only mingles in all the tranfatdions of common life, but con.
iitutes an essential part of them. The Brahmins, who, as mi-
niflers of religion, preside in all its fundions, are elevated
above every other order of men, by an origin deemed not only
more noble, but acknowledged to be sacrcd. They have cfta-
blilhed among themselves a regular hierarchy and gradation of
ranks, which, by securing subordination in their own order,

adds weight to their authority, and gives them a more absolute
dionilInn over the minds of the people. This dominion they
l;1p-ort by the command of the immense revenues with which
the liberallty of princes, and the zeal of pilgrims and devotees,
have cliriched their Pagodas".

IT is far from my intention to enter into any minute detail

with refpea to this vast and complicated fyflem of superstition.
An attempt to enumerate the multitude of deities which are
the objects of adoration in India; to describe the splendour of
wcrlhip in their Pagodas, and the immense variety of their
rites and ceremonies; to recount the various attributes and func-
tions which the craft of priefls, or the credulity of the people,
have ascribed to their divinities; especially if I were to accom-
pany all this with a review of the numerous and often fanciful
)peculatiolns and theories of learned men on this subjet, would
require a work of great magnitude. I flhall, therefore, on this,
as on some of the former heads, confine myself to the precise
point which I have kept uniformly in view, and by confidering
the state of religion in IndLi, I fiall endeavour not only to
throw additional light on the iate of civilization in that coun-
try, but I flatter myself that, at the fame time, I lhall be able to
give what may be confidered as a {ketch and outline of the
hiflory and progress of fuperlition and false religion in every
region of the earth.

I. WE may observe, that, in every country, the received
mythology, or system of fuperflitious belief, with all the rites

and ceremonies which it prescribes is formed in the infancy of
society, in rude and barbarous times. True religion is as dif-
ferent from superstition in its origin, as in its nature. The for-
mer is the offspring of reason cherished by science, and at-
tains to its highest perfe&ion in ages of light and improvement.
Ignorance and fear give birth to the latter, and it is always in the
darkest periods that it acquires the greatest vigour. That numerous
part of the human species whose lot is labour, whose principal
and almost sole occupation is to secure subsistence, has nei-
ther leisure nor capacity for entering into that path of intricate
and refined speculation, which conduts to the knowledge of
the principles of rational religion. When the intellectual
powers are just beginning to unfold, and their firt feeble ex-
ertions are directed towards a few objets of primary necessity
and use; when the faculties of the mind are so limited as not
to have formed general and abRrat ideas; when language is so
barren as to be destitute of names to distinguish any thing not
perceivable by some of the senses; it is preposterous to expet
that men ihould be capable of tracing the relation between effets
and their causes; or to suppose that they should rife from the
contemplation of the former to the dilcovery of the latter, and
form just conceptions of one Supreme Being, as the Creator
and Governor of the universe. The idea of creation is so fa-
miliar, wherever the mind is enlarged by lcience, and illumi-
nated by revelation, that we seldom reflea how profound and
abstruse the idea is, or confider what progrles man must have
made in observation and research, before he could arrive at any
diftin& knowledge of this elementary principle in religion.
But even in its rude state, the human mind, formed for rcli-

S s gion,

313

gion, opens to the reception of ideas, which are destined, when
correced and refined, to be the great source of consolation
amidit the calamities of life. These apprehensions, however,
are originally in:diiinat and perplexed, and seem to be fug-
gcfted rather by the dread of impending evils, than to flow
from gratitude for blessings received. While nature holds on
her course with uniform and undisturbed regularity, men enjoy
the benefits resulting from it, without much inquiry concern-
ing its cause. But every deviation from this regular course
rouses and aftonilies them. When they behold events to which
they are not accustomed, they search for the causes of them with
eager curiosity. Their underltanding is often unable to disco-
ve' these, but imagination, a more forward and ardent faculty
of the mind, decides without hesitation. It ascribes the extra-
ordinary occurrences in nature to the influence of invisible
beings, and supposes the thunder, the hurricane, and the earth-
quake, to be the immediate effect of their agency. Alarmed
by these natural evils, and exposed, at the fame time, to many
dangers and disasters, which are unavoidable in the early and
uncivilized state of society, men have recourse for protection to
power superior to what is human, and the firtl rites or practices
which bear any resemblance to ats of religion have it for their
objet to avert evils which they susser or dread x.

In the second volume of the Hiflory of America, p. 183, of fifth edition,

I gave nearly a similar account of the origin of falle religion. Instead of la-
bouring to convey the tfme ideas in different langahge, I have infected here
some paragraphs in the fame words I then uscd.

II. As
314

II. As fuperftiton and false religion take their rife, in every

country, from nearly the fame sentiments and apprehensions,
the invisible beings, who are the firR objeas of veneration, have
every where a near resemblance. To conceive an idea of one
filperintending mind, capable of arranging and direaing all the
various operations of nature, seems to be an attainment far
beyond the powers of man in the more early Rages of his pro-
grefs. His theories, more suited to the limited sphere of his own
observation, are not so refined. He supposes that there is a
distinct cause of every remarkable effe&, and ascribes to a fe-
parate power every event which attracts his attention, or excites
his terror. He fancies that it is the province of one deity to
point the lightning, and, with an awful found, to hurl the ir-
resistible thunderbolt at the head of the guilty; that another
rides in the whirlwind, and, at his pleasure, raises or tills the
tempef; that a third rules over the ocean; that a fourth is
the god of battles; that while malevolent powers featter the
feeds of animosity and discord, and kindle in the bread those
angry passions which give rife to war, and terminate in deftruc-
tion, others, of a nature more benign, by inspiring the hearts
of men with kindncfs and love, ftrengthcn the bonds of social
union, augment the happiness; and incrcafe the number of the
human race.

WITHOUT descending farther into detail, or attempting to

enumerate that infinite multitude of deities to which the fancy
or the fears of men have allotted the direction of the several
departments in nature, we may recognifc a striking uniformity
of features in the systems of fiiperftition cflablilced throughout

S s 2 every

315

every part of the earth. The less men have advanced beyond
the state of savage life, and the more fender their acquaintance
with the operations of nature, the fewer were their deities in
number, and the more compendious was their theological creed;
but as their mind gradually opened, and their knowledge con-
tinued to extend, the objects of their veneration multiplied,
and the articles of their faith became more numerous. This
took place remarkably among the Greeks in Europe, and the
Indians in Asia, the two people, in those great divisions of the
earth, who were most early civilized, and to whom, for that
reason, I shall confine all my observations. They believed, that
over every movement in the natural world, and over every func-
tion in civil or domestic life, even the most common and trivial,
a particular deity presided. The manner in which they arranged
the flations of these superintending powers, and the offices
which they allotted to each, were in many refpecs the fame.
What is supposed to be performed by the power of Jupiter, of
Neptune, of .Eolus, of Mars, of Venus, according to the my-
thology of the Weft, is ascribed in the East to the agency of
Agnce, the god of fire; Varoon, the god of oceans; Vayoo,
the god of wind '; Cama, the god of love; and a variety of
other divinities.

THE ignorance and credulity of men having thus peopled the

heavens with imaginary beings, they ascribed to them such
qualities and actions as they deemed suitable to their character
and functions. It is one of the benefits derived from true re-

ligion, that by setting before men a standard of perfect excel-
lence, which they should have always in their eye, and en-
deavour to resemble, it may be said to bring down virtue from
heaven to earth, and to form the human mind after a divine
model. In fabricating systems of false religion the procedure
is directly the reverse. Men ascribe to the beings whom they
havedeified, such actions as they themselves admire and celebrate.
The qualities of the gods who are the objeals of adoration, are
copied from those of the worshippers who bow down before
them; and thus many of the imperfections peculiar to men
have found admittance into heaven. By knowing the adven-
tures and attributes of any false deity, we can pronounce, with
some degree of certainty, what must have been the state of so-
ciety and manners when he was elevated to that dignity. The
mythology of Greece plainly indicates the character of the age
in which it was formed. It must have been in times of the
greatest licentiousness, anarchy, and violence, that divinities of
the highest rank could be supposed capable of perpetrating ac-
tions, or of being influenced by paflions, which, in more en-
lightened periods, would be deemed a disgrace to human na-
ture; it must have been when the earth was fill infested
with deftrudive monsters, and mankind, under forms of go-
vernment too feeble to afford them protection, were exposed
to the depredations of lawless robbers, or the cruelty of ravage
oppressors, that the well-known labours of Hercules, by which
he was raised from earth to heaven, could have been neclfary,
or would have been deemed so highly meritorious. The fame
observation is applicable to the ancient mythology of India.
Many of the adventures and exploits of the Indian deities

I are

317

are suited to the rudest ages of turbulence and rapine. It was
to check disorder, to redress wrongs, and to clear the earth of
powerful oppressors, that Vilhnou, a divinity of the highest
order, is said to have become fucceflively incarnate, and to have
appeared on earth in various forms .

III. THE chara&er and functions of those deities which fu-

perftition created to itself as objeas of its veneration, having
every where a near resemblance, the rites of their worlhip were
every where extremely similar. Accordingly as deities were
diftinguilhed, either by ferocity of characer or licentiousness
of conduct, it is obvious what services muf have been deemed
most acceptable to them. In order to conciliate the favour, or
to appease the wrath, of the former, salts, mortifications, and
penances, all rigid, and many of them excruciating to an ex-
treme degree, were the means employed. Their altars were al-
ways bathed in blood, the mot cosily vicims were offered,
whole hecatombs were slaughtered, even human sacrifices were
not unknown, and were held to be the most powerful expia-
tions. In order to gain the good-will of the deities of the
latter description, recourse was had to institutions of a very dif-
ferent kind, to splendid ceremonies, gay festivals, heightened by
all the pleasures of poetry, mufick, and dancing, but often ter-
minating in scenes of indulgence too indecent to be deferibed.
Of both there, instances occur in the rites of Greek and Roman
worflip, which I need not mention to my learned readers'. In

the

the East the ceremonial of superstition is nearly the fame.
The manners of the Indians, though diftinguifled, from the
time when they became known to the people of the Weft, for
mildness, seem, in a more remote period, to have been, in a
greater degree, similar to those of other nations. Several of
their deities were fierce and awful in their nature, and were re-
presented in their temples under the most terrific forms. If we
did not know the dominion of superstition over the human
mind, we should hardly believe, that a ritual of worship suited
to the character of such deities could have been eflablifled
among a gentle people. Every aft of religion, performed in
honour of some of their gods, seems to have been prescribed
by fear. Mortifications and penances so rigorous, so painful,
and so long continued, that we read the accounts of them with
aftonilhment and horror, were multiplied. Repugnant as it is
to the feelings of an Hindoo, to flied the blood of any crea-
ture that has life, many different animals, even the mdft useful,
thehorfe and the cow, were offered up as victims upon the altars
of some of their gods'; and what is fill more firange, the
Pagodas of the East were polluted with human sacrifices, as well
as the temples of the Weft . But religious inltitutions, and
ceremonies of a less revere kind, were more adapted to the
genius of a people, formed, by the extreme sensibility both of
their mental and corporeal frame, to an immoderate love of
pleasure. In no part of the earth was a connection between

the gratification of sensual desire and the rites of public reli-
gion, displayed with more avowed indecency than in India. In
every Pagoda there was a band of women set apart for the
service of the idol honoured there, and devoted from their early
years to a life of pleasure; foi which the Brahmins prepared them
by an education which added so many elegant accompliihments
to their natural charms, that what they gained by their profligacy,
often brought no inconsiderable accession to the revenue of the
temple. In every fun&ion performed in the Pagodas, as well
as in every public procession, it is the office of these women to
dance before the idol, and to sing hymns in his praise; and it
is difficult to fay, whether they trespass most againfi decency by
the gestures they exhibit, or by the verses which they recite.
The walls of the Pagoda are covered with paintings, in a stile
no less indelicated; and in the innermost recess of the temple,
for it would be profane to call it the fantuary, is placed the
w1gam, an emblem of producive power too gross to be ex-
plained '.

IV. How absurd soever the articles of faith may be which

fuperifition has adopted, or how unhallowed the rites which it
prescribes, the former are received in every age and country
with unhesitating assent, by the great body of the people, and
the latter observed with scrupulous exadnefs. In our reason-

ings
320

ings concerning religious opinions and practices which differ
widely- from our own, we are extremely apt to err. Having
been inftruted ourselves in the principles of a religion, worthy
in every refpec of that divine wisdom by which they were dic-
tated, we frequently express wonder at the credulity of nations
in embracing systems of belief which appear to us so directly
repugnant to right reason, and sometimes fufped that tenets so
wild and extravagant do not really gain credit with them. But
experience may satisfy us, that neither our wonder nor suspicions
are well founded. No article of the public religion was called
in question by those people of ancient Europe with whose his-
tory we are best acquainted, and no practice which it enjoined
appeared improper to them. On the other hand, every opinion
that tended to diminilh the reverence of men for the gods of
their country, or to alienate them from their worlhip, excited
among the Greeks and Romans, that indignant zeal which is
natural to every people attached to their religion, by a firm
persuasion of its truth. The attachment of the Indians, both
in ancient and modern times, to the tenets and rites of their
ancestors, has been, if possible, still greater. In no country, of
which we have any account, were precautions taken with so
much solicitude, to place the great body of the people beyond
the reach of any temptation to doubt or disbelief. They not only
were prevented, (as I have already observed the great bulk Vs
mankind must always be in every country,) from entering upon
any speculative inquiry, by the various occupations of active
and laborious life, but any attempt to extend the sphere of their
knowledge was expressly prohibited. If one of the Sooder
cafl, by far the moRl numerous of the four into which the

T t whole

whole nation was divided, presumed to read any portion of the
sacred books, in which all the science known in India is con-
tained, he was severely punilhed; if he ventured to get it by
heart, he was put to death'. To aspire after any higher degree
of knowledge than the Brahmins have been pleased to teach,
would be deemed not only presumption but impiety. Even the
higher Casts depended entirely for inftruaion on the Brah-
mins, and could acquire no portion of science but what they
deigned to communicate. By' means of this, a devout reve-
rence was universally maintained for those inflitutions which
were confidered as sacred; and, though the faith of the Hin-
doos has been often tried by severe persecutions, excited by
the bigotry of their Mahomedan conquerors, no people ever
adhered with greater fidelity to the tenets and rites of their
ancestors '.

V. WE may observe, that when science and philosophy are

diffused through any country, the fyfiem of fuperfition is sub-
jeced to a scrutiny from which it was formerly exempt, and
opinions spread which imperceptibly diminish its influence over
the minds of men. A free and full examination is always fa-
vourable to truth, but fatal to error. What is received with
implicit faith in ages of darkness, will excite contempt or in-
dignation in an enlightened period. The history of religion in
Greece and Italy, the only countries of Europe which, in an-
cient times, were diflinguiihed for their attainments in science,

confirms the truth of this observation. As soon as science
made such progress in Greece as rendered men capable of dif-
cerning the wisdom, the foresight, and the goodness displayed
in creating, preserving, and governing the world, they must
have perceived, that the chara&ers of the divinities which were
proposed as the objecs of adoration in their temples, could
not entitle them to be confidered as the presiding powers in
nature. A poet might address Jupiter as the father of gods and
men, who governed both by eternal laws; but, to a philofo-
pher, the son of Saturn, the fiory of whose life is a series of
violent and licentious deeds, which would render any man
odious or despicable, must have appeared altogether unworthy
of that flation. The nature of the religious service celebrated
in their teniples must have been no less offensive to an enlight-
ened mind, than the charater of the deities in honour of whom
it was performed. Initead of institutions, tending to reclaim
men from vice, to form or to strengthen habits of virtue, or to
elevate the mind to a sense of its proper dignity, superstition
either occupied its votaries in frivolous unmeaning ceremonies,
or prescribed rites, which operated, with fatal influence, jn in-
flaming the pafions and corrupting the heart.

IT is with timidity, however, and caution, that men ven-

ture to attack the established religion of their country, or to
impugn opinions which have been long held sacred. At first,
some philosophers endcavoured, by allegorical interpretations
and refined comments, to explain the popular mythology, as
if it had been a description of the powers of nature, and of
the various events and revolutions which take place in the

T t 2 system

323

system of the material world, and endeavoured, by this expedient,
to palliate many of its absurdities. By degrees, bolder theories
concerning religion were admitted into the schools of science.
Philosophers of enlarged views, sensible of the impiety of the
popular fuperfiition, formed ideas concerning the perfections of
one Supreme Being, the Creator and Ruler of the univcrfe, as
just and rational as have ever been attained by the unaflifted
powers of the human mind.

IF from Europe we now turn to Asia, we Ihall find, that the

observation which I have made upon the hiltory of false religion
holds equally true there. In India as well as in Greece, it was
by cultivating science that men were first led to examine and to
entertain doubts with respect to the established fyfltms of fu-
pcrflition; and when we confider the great difference between
tile ecclefiatical constitution (if I may use that expression) of
the two countries, we are apt to imagine that the eftablilhed
system lay more open to examination in the latter than in the
former. In Greece there was not any diftint race or order of
men set apart for performing the funtions of religion, or to
fcrve as hereditary and interested guardians of its tenets and
institutions. But in India the Brahmins were born the ministers
of religion, and they had an exclusive right of presiding in all
the numerous rites of worlhip which superstition prescribed as
necessary to avert the wrath of Heaven, or to render it propi-
tious. These diPtinaions and privileges secured to them a
wonderful ascendant over their countrymen; and every confi.
deration that can influence the human mind, the honour, the
intcrelt, the power of their order, called upon them to support

the tenets, and to maintain the institutions and rites, with
which the preservation of this aflendant was so intimately
conneced.

BUT as the most eminent persons of the cair devoted their

lives to the cultivation of Icience, the progress which they made
in all the branches of it (of which I have given some account)
was great, and enabled them to form such a just idea of the
system of nature, and of the power, wisdom, and goodne's
displayed in the formation and government of it, as elevated
their minds above the popular superstition, and led them to
acknowledge and reverence one Supreme Being, " the Creator
" of all things (to use their own expressions), and from whom
" all things proceed h.''

THIS is the idea which Abul Fazel, who examined the opi-

nions of the Brahmins with the greatest attention and candour,
gives of their theology. " They all," fays he, " believe in
" the unity of the Godhead, and although they hold images
"in high veneration, it is only because they represent celestial
" beings, and prevent their thoughts from wandering'." The
sentiments of the most intelligent Europeans who have visited
India, coincide perfetly with his, in refpea to this point.
The accounts which Mr. Bernier received from the Pundits of
Benares, both of their external worlhip, and of one Sovereign
Lord being the sole objet of their devotion, is precisely the
fame with that given by Abul Fazel L. Mr. Wilkins, better

qualified perhaps than any European ever was to judge with
refpe& to this subjea, represents the learned Brahmins of the
present times as Theists, believers in the unity of God'. Of
the fame opinion is M. Sonnerat, who resided in India seven
years in order to inquire into the manners, sciences, and reli-
gion of the Hindoos . The Pundits, who translated the Code
of Gentoo Laws, declare, " that it was the Supreme Being,
' who, by his power, formed all creatures of the animal, ve-
" getable, and material world, from the four elements of fire,
"water, air, and earth, to be an ornament to the magazine of

creation; and whose comprehensive benevolence selected

" man, the center of knowledge, to have dominion and
"authority over the reft; and, having bestowed upon this fa-
" ourite object judgment and underfianding, gave him fupre-
" macy over the corners of the world '."

NoR are these to be regarded as refined sentiments of latter

times. The Brahmins being confidered by the Mahomedan
conquerors of India as the guardians of the national religion,
have been so studiously depressed by their fanatical zeal, that
the modem members of that order are as far inferior to their
ancestors in science as in power. It is from the writings of
their ancient Pundits that they derive the most liberal senti-
ments which they entertain at present, and the wisdom for
which they are now celebrated has been transmitted to them
from ages very remote.

TIIAT

THAT this aflertion is well founded we are enabled to pro-

nounce with certainty, as the most profound myftcries of Hin-
doo theology, concealed with the greatest care fro:n the body
of the people, have been unveiled by the translations from
the Sanfkrect language lately published. The principal design
of the Baghvat-Geeta, an epilbde in the Maliabarat, a poem of
the highest antiquity, and of the greatest authority in India,
seems to have been to eflablifh the doctrine of the unity of tihc
Godhead, and from a just view of the divine nature, to deduce
an idea of what worlhip will be mofl acceptable to a perfedc
Being. In it, amidst much obscure metaphysical difcuflion,.
some ornaments of fancy unsuited to our taste, and some
thoughts elevated to a tiad of sublimity into which our habits
of judgment will find it difficult to pursue them , we find de-
scriptions of the Supreme Being entitled to equal praise with
those of the Greek philosophers which I have celebrated.
Of these I shall now produce one which I formerly mentioned,.
and refer my readers for others to the work itself: " 0 mighty
" Being," fays Arjoon, " who art the prime Creator, eternal God

of Gods, the World's Mansion. Thou art the incorruptible
Being, diftinQ from all things transient. Thou art before

"all Gods, the ancient PoorooJh [i. e. vital foul], and the
"Supreme Supporter of the universe. Thou knoweft all things,
" and art worthy to be known; thou art the Supreme Man-

sion, and by thee, O infinite Form, the universe was fprcad

" abroad.-Revercnce be unto thee before and behind; reve-
"rence be unto thee on all fides; O thou who art all in all.

* Mr. [laltings's Letter, prefixed to the Bjlgvat.Gccta, p. 7.

" Infinite
5

327

" Infinite is thy power and thy glory.-Thou art the father of
" all things, animate and inanimate. Thou art the wife in-
" fiructor of the whole, worthy to be adored. There is
"none like unto thee; where then, in the three worlds,
"is there one above thee? Wherefore I bow down; and,
" with my body prostrate upon the ground, crave thy mercy,
"Lord! Worthy to be adored; for thou Ihouldeft bear with
" me, even as a father with his son, a friend with his friend,
" a lover with his beloved P." A description of the Supreme
Being is given in one of the sacred books of the Hindoos,
from which it is evident what were the general sentiments of
the learned Brahmins concerning the divine nature and perfec-
tions: " As God is immaterial, he is above all conception;
"as he is invisible, he can have no form; but from what we
"behold of his works we may conclude, that he is eternal, om-
"nipotent, knowing all things, and present every where q."

To men capable of forming such ideas of the Deity, the

public service in the Pagodas must have appeared to be an idol-
atrous worship of images, by a fuperflitious multiplication of
frivolous or immoral rites; and they must have seen that it
was only by fanaity of heart, and purity of manners, men
could hope to gain the approbation of a Being perfec in good-
ncfs. This truth Veias labours to inculcate in the Mahabarat,
but with the prudent reserve, and artful precautions, natural to
a Brahmin, studious neither to offend his countrymen, nor to
diminifi the influence of his own order. His ideas concerning

? Bshvat-Gccta, p. 94. 95. a Dow's Diffcrt. p. xl.

the

the mode of worshipping the Deity, are explained in many
striking paflages of the poem, but, unwilling to multiply quo-
tations, I satisfy myself with referring to them'.

WHEN we recollec how slowly the mind- of man opens to

abftradc ideas, and how difficult (according to an observation in
the Mahabarat) an invisible path is to corporeal beings, it is
evident that the Hindoos must have attained an high degree
of improvement before their sentiments rose so far superior to
the popular superstition of their country. The different states
of Greece had fublifed long, and had made considerable pro-
grefs in refinement, before the errors of false religion began to
be detected. It was not until the age of Socrates, and in the
schools of philosophy eftabliflcd by his disciples, that principles
adverse to the tenets of the popular superstition were much
propagated.

A LONGER period of time elapsed before the Romans, a

nation of warriors and statesmen, were enlightened by science,
or ventured upon any free difquilition concerning the objects or
the rites of worlhip authorized by their ancestors. But in
India the happy effects of progress in science were much more
early conspicuous. Without adopting the wild computations of
Indian chronology, according to which, the Mahabarat was
composed above four thousand years ago, we muff allow, that
it is a work of very great antiquity, and the author of it dif-
covers an acquaintance with the principles of theology, of mo-

rals,

rals, and of metaphyfcs, more just and rational, than seems to
have been attained, at that period, by any nation whole history
is known.

BUT so unable are the limited powers of the human mind to

form an adequate idea of the perfe&ions and operations of the
Supreme Being, that in all the theories concerning them,
of the most eminent philosophers in the moll enlightened
nations, we find a lamentable mixture of ignorance and error.
From these the Brahmins were not more exempt than the fages
of other countries. As they held that the system of nature was
not only originally arranged by the power and wisdom of God,
but that every event which happened was brought about by his
immediate interpolition, and as they could not comprehend
how a being could ad in any place unless where it was pre-
1lnt, they supposed the Deity to be a vivifying principle diffused
through the whole creation, an universal foul that animated
each part of it'. Every intelligent nature, particularly the fouls
of men, they conceived to be portions separated from this great
spirit', to which, after fulfilling their defliny on earth, and at-
taining a proper degree of purity, they would be again re-
united. In order to efface the slains with which a foul, during
its residence on earth, has been defiled, by the indulgence of
sensual and corrupt appetites, they taught that it mutl pass, in
a long succession of transmigrations, through the bodies of dif-
ferent animals, until, by what it suffers and what it learns in

the various forms of its existence, it flall be so thoroughly re-
fined from all pollution as to be rendered meet for being ab-
sorbed into the divine essence, and returns like a drop into that
unbounded ocean from which it originally iflued". These
doctrines of the Brahmins, concerning the Deity, as the foul
which pervades all nature, giving activity and vigour to every
part of it, as well as the final re-union of all intelligent crea-
tures to their primaeval source, coincide perfecly with the tenets
of the Stoical School. It is remarkable, that after having ob-
served a near resemblance in the most sublime fcntiments of
their moral dotrine, we flould likewise discover such a fimi-
larity in the errors of their theological speculations".

THE human mind, however, when destitute of superior guid-

ance, is apt to fall into a practical error with refpe& to religion,
of a tendency still more dangerous. When philosophers, by
their attainments in science, began to acquire such just ideas of
the nature and perfections of the Supreme Being, as convinced
them that the popular system of superstition was not only absurd
but impious, they were fully aware of all the danger which might
arise from communicating what they had dilcovered to the peo-
ple, incapable of comprehending the force of those reasons whicl
had swayed with them, and so zealously attached to cftablified
opinions, as to revolt against any attempt to tetccY their fallic-
hood. Instead, therefore, of allowing any ray of that know-

ledge

ledge which illuminated their own minds to reach them, they
formed a theory to justify their own conduct, and to prevent
the darkness of that cloud which hung over the minds of their
fellow-men from being ever dispelled. The vulgar and un-
learned, they contended, had no right to truth. Doomed by
their condition to remain in ignorance, they were to be kept in
order by delusion, and allured to do what is right, or deterred from
venturing upon what is wrong, by the hope of those imaginary
rewards which superstition promises, and the dread of those pu-
nifhments which it threatens. In confirmation of this, I might
quote the docrine of most of the philosophic fecds, and pro-
duce the words of almot every eminentGreek and Roman writer.
It will be sufficient, however, to lay before my readers a re-
markable paffige in Strabo, to whom I have been so often in-
debted in the course of my researches, and who was no less
qualified to judge with respect to the political opinions of his
contemporaries, than to describe the countries which they in-
habited. " What is marvellous in fable, is employed," fays he,
" sometimes to please, and sometimes to inspire terror, and
" both there are of use, not only with children, but with per-
" sons of mature age. To children we propose delightful sic-

tions, in order to encourage them to aa well, and such as

"as are terrible, in order to restrain them from evil. Thus
" when men are united in society, they are incited to what
"is laudable, by hearing the poets celebrate the splendid acions
"of fabulous story, such as the labours of Hercules and The-
" feus, in reward for which they are now honoured as divini-
"ties, or by beholding their illufrious deeds exhibited to
"public view in painting and sculpture. On the other hand,

2 " they
331

"they are deterred from vice, when the punishments inflited
"by the gods upon evil-doers are related, and threats are de-
"nounced against them in awful words, or represented by
" frightful figures, and when men believe that these threats
" have been really executed upon the guilty. For it is impofii-
" ble to conduct women and the gross multitude, and to
" render them holy, pious, and upright, by the precepts of
" reason and philosophy; superstition, or the fear of the gods,
"must be called in aid, the influence of which is founded on
" fiions and prodigies. For the thunder of Jupiter, the xgis
" of Minerva, the trident of. Neptune, the torches and snakes
" of the furies, the spears of the gods, adorned with ivy,
" and the whole ancient theology, are all fables, which the
" legislators who formed the political constitution of fates
"employ as bugbears to overawe the credulous and simple '."

THESE ideas of the philosophers of Europe were precisely

the fame which the Brahmins had adopted in India, and ac-
cording to which they regulated their conduct with refpet to
the great body of the people. As their order had an exclusive
right to read the sacred books, to cultivate and to teach science,
they could more effectually prevent all who were not members
of it from acquiring any portion of information beyond what
they were pleased to impart. When the free circulation of
knowledge is not circumscribcd by such restrictions, the whole
community derives benefit from every new acquisition in science,
the influence of which, both upon sentiment and conduc, ex-
tends insensibly from the few to the many, from the learned to

the ignorant. But wherever the dominion of false religion is
completely established, the body of the people gain nothing by
the greatest improvements in knowledge. Their philosophers
conceal from them, with the utmofft solicitude, the truths which
they have discovered, and labour to support that fabric of fu-
perfition which it was their duty to have overturned. They
not only enjoin others to refpe& the religious rites prescribed
by the laws of their country, but conform to them in their own
pracice, and, with every external appearance of reverence and
devotion, bow down before the altars of deities, who must in-
wardly be the objects of their contempt. Inflead of resembling
the teachers of true religion in the benevolent ardour with
which they have always communicated to their fellow-men the
knowledge of those important truths with which their own
minds were enlightened and rendered happy, the fages of
Greece, and the Brahmins of India, carried on, with fludied
artifice, a scheme of deceit, and, according to an emphatic ex-
pression of an inspired writer, they detained the truth in un-
righteousness '. They knew and approved what was true, but
among the reft of mankind they laboured to support and to per-
petuate what is falle.

THus I have gone through all the particulars which I origi-

nally proposed to examine, and have endeavoured to dilcover
the slate of the ii,habitants of India with refped to each of
them. If I had aimed at nothing else than to describe the
civil policy, the arts, the sciences, and religious institutions of
one of the most ancient and most numerous races of men,

Rom. i. 18.

that

that alone would have led me into inquiries and discussions
both curious and inftruaive. I own, however, that I have all
along kept in view an object more intcrcetinlg, as well as of
greater importance, and entertain hopes, that if the account
which I have given of the early and high civilization of Iidia,
and of the wonderful progress of its inh.hi;.alts in elegant arts
and useful fciencc, shall be received as jult and wcll-cli:llliihcd,
it may have some influence upon the behaviour of Europeans to-
wards that people. Unfortunately for the human fpccics, in what-
ever quarter of the globe the people of Europe have acquired
dominion, they have found the inhabitants not only in a hate
of society and improvement far inferior to their own, but dif-
ferent in their complexion, and in all their habits of life.
Men in every flage of their career are lb atisfied with the
progress made by the community of which they are members,
that it becomes to them a flandard of perfection, and they are
apt to regard people, whose condition is not similar, with con-
tempt, and even aversion. In Africa and America, the dilli-
militude is so conspicuous, that, in the pride of their fupc-
riority, Europeans thought themselves entitled to reduce the
natives of the former to slavery, and to exterminate those of
the latter. Even in India, though far advanced beyond the
two other quarters of the globe in improvement, the colour
of the inhabitants, their effeminate appearance, their unwarlike
fpirit,tle wild extravagance of their religious tenets and ceremonies,
and many other circumftiances, confirmed Europeans in such an
opinion of their own pre-eminence, that they have always viewed
and treated them as an inferior race of men. Happy would
it be if any of the four European nations, who have, fliccefielvy,
acquired extenfivc territories and power in India, could altogether

s v'idic.att

335

vindicate itself from having aaed in this manner. Nothing,
horwever, can have a more diret and powerful tendency to in-
spire Europeans, proud oftlicir own superior attainments in po-
licy, fcicnce, and arts, with proper sentiments concerning the
people cf India, ;nd to teach them a due regard for their na-
tural rights as men, than their being accustomed, not only to
confider the Hindoos of the present times as a knowing and in-
genious race of men, but to view them as descended from an-
ceftors who had attained to a very high degree of improvement,
many ages before the leaf flep towards civilization had been taken
in any part in Europe. It was by an impartial and candid in-
(,u;ry into their manners, that the Emperor Akbcr was led to
conlidcr the Hindoos as no leis entitled to protection and
favour than his other fubjets, and to govern them with such
cquity and mildness, as to merit from a grateful people the
honourable appellation of " The Guardian of Mankind." It
was from a thorough knowledge of their character and ac-
quirements, that his Vizier, Abul Fazel, with a liberality of
mind unexampled among Mahomedans, pronounces an high
encomium on the virtues of the Hindoos, both as indi-
viduals and as members of society, and celebrates their attain-
ments in arts and sciences of every kind'. If I might presume
to hope that the description which I have given of the man-
ners and inflitutions of the people of India could contribute
in the smallest degree, and with the most remote influence, to
render their character more refpe&able, and their condition
more happy, I shall close my literary labours with the' fatisfac-
tion of thinking that I have not lived or written in vain.

" Costes de Choromandel," &c. This was compiled, before the
middle of last century, by Abraham Roger, chaplain of the
Dutch facory at Pullicate. By gaining the confidence of an
intelligent Brahmin, he acquired information concerning the
manners and religion of the Indians, more authentic and ex-
tensive than was known to Europeans prior to the late tranfla-
tions from the Sanfkreet language. I mention this book, be-
cause it seems to be less known than it deserves to be. There
remains now no doubt with refpeC either to the number or the
funifons of the casts, as both are ascertained from the most
ancient and sacred books of the Hindoos, and confirmed by the
accounts of their own institutions, given by Brahmins eminent
for their learning. According to them, the different casts
proceeded from Brahma, the immediate agent of the creation
under the Supreme Power, in the following manner, which efta-
bliflies both the rank which they were to hold, and the office
,which they were required to perform.
The Brahmin, from the mouth (wisdom): To pray, to read,

to inftru&.
The Cbebtiree, from the arms (strength): To draw the bow,

to fight, to govern.
The Bice, from the belly or thighs (nourihiment): To pro-

vide the necessaries of life by agriculture and traffick.

THE preferibed occupations of all these classes are essential in a

well-regulated state. Subordinate to themis a fifth, or adventitious
class, denominated Barrun Sun/ker, supposed to be the offspring
of an unlawful union between persons of different calls. These
are mofly dealers in petty articles of retail trade. Prcfacc to
the Code of Gentoo Laws, p. xlvi. and xcix. This adventi-
tious catl is not mentioned, as far as I know, by any European
author. The diftincion was too nice to be obl:rved by them,
and they seem to confider the members of this cast, as belong-
ing to the Sooder. Besides these acknowledged calls, there is
a race of unhappy men, denominated, on the Coromandel coast,
Pariars, and, in other parts of India, Chandalas. These are
out-calls from their original order, who, by their iiiifcondua,
have forfeited all the privileges of it. Their condition is, un-
doubtedly, the lowest degradation of human nature. No per-
son of any cast will have the least communication with them.
Sonnerat, tom. i p. 55, 56. If a Pariar approach a Nl.j'r, i. c.
a warrior of high call, on the Malabar coast, he may put
him to death with impunity. Water or milk arc confidered as
defiled even by their hiadow passing over them, and cannot be
used until they are purified. Aycen Akbery, vol. iii. p. 243-
It is almost impoflible for words to express the fenlation of
vileness that the name of Pariar or Chandala conveys to the
mind of a Hindoo. Every Hindoo who violates the rules or
inllitutions of his cast finks into this degraded fitlation. This
it is which renders Hindoos so relolute in adhering to the in-
ftitutions of their tribe, because the loss of call is, to them, the
loss of all human comfort and refpeaability; and is a punifil-

doos, and of higher authority than any with which Europeans

TIIE mention of one circumllance rerpecaing the diltinclon

of cafll has been cmitted in the text. Though the line of fe-
plration be so drawn, as to render the ascent from an inferior
to a higher calf ahfolutely impoflible, arid it would be regarded
as a moll enormous impiety, if one in a lower order should
pirfumne to perform any function belonging to those of a fu-
pcrir cafl; yet, in certain cales, the Pundits declare it to be
las ful for pcrfons of a high class to exercise some of the occu-
patio!s allotted to a class below their own, without losing their
call by doing fl. Prcf. of Pundits to the Code of Gentco Laws,

fr ice of their princes, not only as miniluers of slate, Orme's

the Mlahratta fiate, were Brahmins, and some of them Pundits
or learned Brahmins. Ibid. p. 97. Many Seapoys in the
fernice of the East India Company, particularly in the Bengal
rtniidenc, are of the Brahmin cal.

ANOTHIER

ANOTTIER sac concerning the casts deserves notice. An

immense number of pilgrims, amounting, in some years, to
more than Ijo,ooo, visit the Pagoda of Jaggernaut, in Orissa,
(one of the moll ancient and mofl revered places of I-Iindoo
worship,) at the time of the annual festival in honour of the
deity to whom the temple is confccrated. The members of
all the four caRs arc allowed prornilcuoully to approach the
altar of the idol, and feating themselves without diflinclion, cat
indilrriminatcly of the fame food. This fcems to indicate some
remembrance of a slate prior to the inflitution of cals, when all
men were confidered as equal. I have not iltch information as
enables me to account for a practice so repugnant to the tirfl ideas
and principles of the Hindoos, either sacred or civil. Bernicr,

SOME of my readers must have ohfcrved, that I have given

no account of the numerous orders of Indian devotees, to all
of whom European writers give the appellation of a.aquirs; a
name by which the Mahomiedans diftinguifnl fanatical monks
of their own religion. The light in which I have viewed the
religious institutions of the IIindoos, did not rcnder it necclil'ry
that I should conlider the Indian Faquirs particulalr-. Their
number, the rigour of their mortilications, the excruciating pe-
nanccs which they voluntaiily undergo, and the high opinion
which the people entertain of their fancditv, have ltruck all
travellers who have vilitcd In;!ia, and their dcl:riptions of
them are well knowni. Tlic powerifl influence of enthuliafin,
the love of diftincuion, and the dclire of obtaining some por-

tico

341

tion of that reverence and those honours which the Brahmins
are born to enjoy, may account for all the extraordinary
things which they do and susser. One particular concerning
them merits notice. This order of devotees appears to have been
very ancient in India. The description of the Gernani, which
Strabo takes from Megaflhenes, applies, almost in every cir-
cumftance, to the modern Faquirs. Lib. xv. p. o14o. B.

NOTE II. p. 262.

WHAT I have asserted in the text is in general well-

founded. It is the opinion, however, of gentlemen who have
seen much of India, and who observed all they saw with a
discerning eye, that the conquests both of the Mahomedans and
of the Europeans have had some effet upon the manners and
customs of the natives. They imagine that the dress which
the Hindoos now wear, the turban, the jummah, and long
drawers, is an imitation of that worn by their Mahomedan
conquerors. The ancient dress of the Indians, as described by
Arrian, Hist Indic. c. 16. was a muffin cloth thrown loosely
about their shoulders, a muffin Shirt reaching to the middle of
the leg, and their beards were died various colours; which is
not the fame with that used at present. The custom of fe-
cluding women, and the ftricnefs with which they are con-
fined, is likewise fuppoled to have been introduced by the Ma-
homedans. This supposition is in some measure confirped
by the drama of Sacontala, translated from the Sanfkrect.
In that play, several female charaters are introduced, who min-

gle

gle in society, and converse as freely with men, as women
are accustomed to do in Europe. The author, we may pre-
lume, describes the manners, and adheres to the customs of
his own age. But while I mention this remark, it is proper,
likewise, to observe, that, from a passage in Strabo, there is reason
to think, that, in the age of Alexander the Great, women in
India were guarded with the fame jealous attention as at
present. " When their princes," (fays he, copying Megaft-
henes,) " set out upon a public hunt, they are accompanied by
"a number of their women, but along the road in which
"they travel, ropes are stretched on each fide, and if any man
"approach near to them he is instantly put to death." Lib. xv.
p. 1037. A. The influence of European manners begins to be ap-
parent among the Hindoos who reside in the town of Calcutta.
Some of them drive about in English chariots, fit upon chairs, and

IT is amusing to observe how exadly the ideas of an intel-

ligent Asiatic co-incide with those of the Europeans on this
subjet. " In reflexing," fays he, " upon the poverty of
" Turan [the countries beyond the Oxus] and Arabia, I was
" at first at a loss to aflign a reason why thcle countries have
u never been able to retain wealtb, whilst, on the contrary, it

S ` is

"is daily increasing in Indoftan. Timour carried into Turan
"th; riches of Turkey, Persia, and Indoftan, but they are
"all dissipated; and, during the reigns of the four first Ca-
" lphs, Turkey, Persia, part fs Arabia, Ethiopia, Egypt, and
"Spain, were their tributaries; but fill they were not rich.
"It is evident, then, that this difipation of the riches of a
" Rate, must have happened either from extraordinary drains,
"or from some defea in the government. Indoftan has been
"frequently plundered by foreign invaders, and not one of its
"kings ever gained for it any acquisition of wealth; nei-
"ther has the country many mines of gold and silver, and
" yet Indoftan abounds in money and every other kind of
" wealth. The abundance of specie is undoubtedly owing to
"the large importation of gold and silver in the ihips of
" Europe, and other nations, many of whom bring ready
" money in exchange for the manufacures and natural pro-
"ductions of the country. If this is not the cause of the
" prefperous slate of Indoftan, it must be owing to the peculiar
"blessing of God." Memoirs of Khojeh Abdul-kurreem, a

TIIAT the monarchs of India were the sole proprietors of land,

is afterted in most explicit terms by the ancients. The people (fay
they) pay a land-tax to their kings, because the kingdom is regal
property. Strabo, lib. xv. p. 1030. A. Diod. Sicul. lib. ii.

. 53'. This was not peculiar to India. In all the great monarchies
of the Eafl, the sole property of land seems to be vested in the so-
344

vereign

vereign as lord paramount. According to Chardin, this is the
state of property in Persia, and lands were let by the monarch
to the farmers who cultivated them, on conditions nearly rc-
fembling those granted to the Indian Ryots. Voyages, tom. iii.
p. 339, &c. 4to. M. Volney gives a similar account of the
tenure by which lands are held in one of the great provinces-
of the Turkifl empire. Voy. en Syrie, &c. tom. ii. p. 369,
&c. The precise mode, however, in which the Ryots of
Indoflan held their pofieffions, is a circumstance in its ancient
political conftituiion, with refpet to which gentlemen of fupe-
rior discernment, who have resided long in the country, and
filled some of the highest flations in government, have formed
very different opinions. Some have imagined that grants of
land were made by the sovereign to villages or small communities,
the inhabitants of which, under the direaion of their own
chiefs or heads-men, laboured it in common, and divided the
produce of it among them in certain proportions. Defcript.
de 'Inde, par M. Bernouilli, tom. ii. 223, &c. Others main-
tain, that the property of land has been transferred from the
crown to hereditary officers of great eminence and power,
denominated Zemindars, who collea the rents from the Ryots,
and parcel out the lands among them. Others contend, that
the office of the Zemindars is temporary and ministerial, that
they are merely colletors of revenue, removeable at pleasure,
and the tenure by which the Ryots hold their possessions is de-
rived immediately from the sovereign. This las opinionis support-
ed with great ability, by Mr. Grant, in an Inquiry into the Nature
ofZemindaryTenures in the landed Property of Bengal,&c. This
question till continues to be agitated in Bengal, and such plan-
fible arguments have been produced in support of the different

Y y opinions,

opinions, that although it be a point extremely interefling, as
the future system of British finance in India appears likely to
hinge, in an essential degree, upon it, persons well acquainted
with the Rate of India, have not been able thoroughly to make
up their minds upon this subject Capt. Kirkpatrick's Introd.

N° II. p. 130. Though the opinion of the Committee of
Revenue, composed of pcrfoni eminent for their abilities, leans
to a ccnclufion againf the hereditary right of the Zemindarsin the
foil, yet the Supreme Council, in the year 7S6, declined, for good
rcafons, to give any decisive judgment on a subjed of such mag-
nitude. This note was sent to the prefsbefore Ihad it in my power
to peruse Mr. Rouse's ingenious and inftruAive Dissertation con-
cerning the landed property of Bengal. In it he adopts an opi-
nion contrary to that of Mr. Grant, and maintains, with thatcan-
dour and liberality of sentiment which are always conspicuous
x hc rethere is no otherobje& inview butthe discovery of truth,that
!ic Zemindars of Bengal possess their landed property by hereditary
giSt. Did I possess such knowledge, either of the state of India,
or of the -fylem of adminiitration established there, as would be
requilhe for comparing there different theories, and determining
w hich of them merits the preference, the subjec of my refearchcs
&cees not render it necessary to enter into such a difquifiticn. I
imagine, however, that the tate of landed property in India
migi;t be greatly illustrated by an accurate comparison of it with
the nature of feudal tenures; and I apprehend that there might
1'e traced there a fucceflion of changes taking place, in much the
flme order as has been observed in Europe, from which it might
appear, that the poffeflon of land was granted at sirs during
pleasure, afterwards for life, and at length became perpetual

and
346

and hereditary property. But even under this last form, when.
land is acquired either by purchase or inheritance, the manner
in which the right of property is confirmed and rendered com-
plete, in Europe by a Charter, in India by a Sunnud from the
sovereign, seems to point out what was its original state. Ac-
cording to each of the theories which I have mentioned, the te-
nure and condition of the Ryots nearly resemble the defeription
which I have given of them. Their state, according to the
accounts of intelligent observers, is as happy and independent
as falls to the lot of any race of men employed in the cultiva-
tion of the earth. The ancient Greek and Roman writers,
whose acquaintance with the interior parts of India was very
imperfect, represent the fourth part of the annual produce of
land as the general average of rent paid to the sovereign. Upon
the authority of a popular author who flourished in India prior to
the Christian ara, we may conclude that a sixth part of the
people's income was, in his time, the usual portion of the so-
vereign. Sacontala, AR V. p. 53. It is now known that
what the sovereign receives from land varies greatly in different
parts of the country, and is regulated by the fertility or barren-
ness of the foil, the nature of the climate, the abundance or
scarcity of water, and many other obvious circumstances. By
the account given of it, I fliould imagine that, in some diftrids,
it has been raised beyond its due proportion. One circumstance
with refpe& to the adminiflration of revenue in Bengal merits
notice, as it redounds to the honour of the Emperor Akber, the
wisdom of whole government 1 have often had occasion to cele-
brate. A general and regular assessment of revenue in Bengal
was formed in his reign. All the lands were then valued, and
the rent of each inhabitant and of each village ascertained.

Y y 2 Are-

347

A regular gradation of accounts was eltablilhed. The rents of
the different inhabitants who lived in one neighbourhood being
colleced together, formed the account of a village; the
rents of several villages being next colleied into one view,
formed the accounts of a larger portion of land. The ag-
gregate of there accounts exhibited the rent of a diftri&,
and the fum total of the rents of all the diftrias in Bengal
formed the account of the revenue of the whole province.
From the reign of Akber to the government of Jaffeer Ali
Cawn, A. D. 1757, the annual amount of revenue, and the
modes of levying it, continued with little variation. But in
order to raise the fum which he had flipulated to pay on his
elevation, he departed from the wife arrangements of Akber;
many new modes of assessment were introduced, and exaaions
multiplied.

I SHALL mention only one inflance of their attention to

this useful regulation of police. Lahore, in the Panjab, is dif-
tant from Agra, the ancient capital of Indoftan, five hundred
miles. Along each fide of the road between these two great cities,
there is planted a continued row of Ihady trees, forming an
avenue, to which (whether we confider its extent, its beauty,
or utility in a hot climate) there is nothing similar in any coun-
try. Rennel's Memoir, p. 69.

NOTE VI. p. 272.

WE cannot place the equitable and mild government of Ak-
her in a point of view more advantageous, than by contrafling

3 it
348

it with the condu& of other Mahomedan princes. In no coun-
try did this contrast ever appear more striking than in India.
In the thousandth year of the ChriRian aera, Mahmud of
Ghazna, to whose dominion were fubjeded the fame countries
which formed the ancient kingdom of Ba&ria, invaded that
country. Every Rep of his progress in it was marked with
blood and desolation. The most celebrated pagodas, the an-
cient monuments of Hindoo devotion and magnificence, were
destroyed, the ministers of religion were massacred, and with
undiftinguilhing ferocity the country was laid waste, and the
cities plundered and burnt. About four hundred years after
Mahmud, Timur orTamerlane,a conqueror of higher fame,turned
his irresistible arms against Indoftan,and, though born in an age
more improved, he not only equalled, but often so far surpassed
the cruel deeds of Mahmud, as to be justly branded with the
odiuus name of the " Destroying Prince," which was given to
him by the Hindoos, the undererving vitims of his rage. A
rapid but elegant description of their devaflations may be found
in Mr. Orme's DiTfertation on the Establishments made by the
Mahomedan conquerors in Indoftan. A more full -account
of them is given by Mr. Gibbon, vol. v. p. 646. vol. vi.
p. 339, &c. The arrogant contempt with which bigotted
Mahomedans view all the nations who have not embraced the
religion of the prophet, will account for the unrelenting rigour
of Mahmud and Timur towards the Hindoos, and greatly en-
hances the merit of the tolerant spirit and moderation with
which Akber governed his fuhjects. What impression the mild
administration of Akber made upon the Hindeos, we learn
from a beautiful letter of Jeffwant Sing, Rajah of Joudpore,

to

349

to Aurengzebe, his fanatical and persecuting fucceflor. " Your
"royal ancestor, Akber, whose throne is now in heaven, con-
" du&ed the affairs of this empire in equity and firm security
" for the space of fifty-two years, preserving every tribe of
"men in ease and happiness; whether they were followers of

Jesus, or of Moses, of David, or of Mahomed; were they

"Brahmins, were they of the fed of Dharians, which denies
"the eternity of matter, or of that which ascribes the existence
" of the world to chance, they all equally enjoyed his counte-
"nance and favour; insomuch that his people, in gratitude
"for the indiscriminate protection which he afforded them,
"distinguished him by the appellation of Jiiggut Grow, Guar-
"dian of Mankind.- If your Majesty places any faith in
"those books, by diflinQion called divine, you will there be
" inftruded, that God is the God of all mankind, not the
"God of Mahomedans alone. The Pagan and the Mufful-
"man are equally in his pretence. Diftin&ious of colours are
" of his ordination. It is He who gives existence. In your
"temples, to his Name, the voice is raised in prayer; in a
"house of images, where the bell is shaken, fill He is the

" other men, is to fct at naught the pleasure of the Almighty.

I HAVE not attempted a description of any subterraneous

excavations but those of Elephanta, because none of them
have been so often visited, or so carefully infpe&ed. In fe-
veral parts of India, there are, however, stupendous works of a
similar nature. The extent and magnificence of the excavations
in the island of Salfette are such, that the artist employed bv Go-
vernor Boon to make drawings of them, asserted that it would
require the labour of forty thousand men for forty years to finilh
them. Archaeologia, vol. vii. p. 336. Loose as this mode of
climation may be, it conveys an idea of the impression which
the view of them made upon his mind. The Pagodas of
Ellore, eighteen miles from Aurungabad, are likewise hewn
out of the solid rock, and if they do not equal those of Ele-
phanta and Salfette in magnitude, they surpass them far in their
extent and number. M. Thevenot, who first gave any de-
scription of theie singular mansions, asserts, that for above two
leagues all around the mountain nothing is to be fecn but Pa-
godas. Voy. part iii. ch. 44. They were examincd at greater
Icifure and with more attention by M. Anquetil du Perron,
but as his long description of them is not accompanied with

Indian buildings, is confirmed by Colonel Call, chief engineer
at Madras, who urges this as a proof of the early and high ci-
vilization of the Indians. " It may safely be pronounced,"
fays he, " that no part of the world has more marks of anti-
" quity for arts, sciences, and civilization, than the peninsula
" of India, from the Ganges to Cape Comorin. I think the

the grandeur of the work, exceeds any thing executed now-

INDIA, fays Strabo, produces a variety of substances which

dye the mot admirable colours. That the fndicum, which pro-
duced the beautiful blue colour, is the fame with the Indigo of

the
3S2

the moderns, we may conclude not only from the refemblancc of
the name, and the similarity of the effes, but from the defrip-
tion given by Pliny in the passage which I have quoted in the text.
He knew that it was a preparation of a vegetable 'ubftance,
though he was ill-informed both concerning the plant itself,
and the proccfs by which it was fitted for ule, which will not
appear surprising when we recollect the strange ignorance of
the ancients with refpeA to the origin and preparation of silk.
From the colour of Indigo, in the form in which it was im-
ported, it is denominated by some authors, A;ramentiim Indi-
cum, and Indicunm Nigrm, Salmaf. Exercit. p. iSo, and is
mentioned under the las of there names, among the articles of
importation from India. Peripl. Mar. Erythr. p. 22. The
colour of the modern Indigo, when undiluted, resembles that
of the ancient Indicum, being so intensely coloured as to ap-
pear black. Delaval's Experim. Inquiry into the Cause
of the Changes of Colours, Pref. p. xxii. The Gum
Lacca, used in dying a red colour, was likewise known to the
ancients, and by the fame name which it now bears. Salnaf.
Exercit. p. 81o. This valuable substance, of such extensive
utility in painting, dying, japanning, varnishing, and in
the manufacture of fealing-wax, is the production of a very
minute inset. There infecs fix themselves upon the fucculcnt
extremities of the branches of certain trees, and are soon glued
to the place on which they fettle, by a thick pellucid liquid
which exudes from their bodies, the gradual accumulation of
which forms a complete cell for each infect, which is the tomb
of the parent, and the birth-place of its offspring. This glu-
tinous substance, with which the branches of trees are entirely
covered, is the Gum-lacca. An account of its formation, na-

of the colour which it dyes. Excerpta ex Indic. ad calc.

dying cotton-ftuffs with different colours, it is evident that
the ancient Indians must have made some considerable profi-
ciency in chemical knowledge. Pliny, lib. xxxv. c. ii. § 42.
gives an account of this art as far as it was known anciently.
It is precisely the fame with that now praaifed in callico-

As Sanfreetliterature is altogether a new acquisition to Europe,

Baghvat-Geeta, the first translation from that language, having
been publilhed so late as A. D. 1785, it is intimately conneced
with the fubje& of my inquiries, and may afford entertain-
ment to some of my readers, after having reviewed in the text,
with a greater degree of critical attention, the two Sanflreet
works most worthy of notice, to give here a fuccinc account
of other compositions in that tongue with which we have
been made acquainted. The extensive use of the Sanfkrect
language is a circumstance which merits particular attention.

" The
354

" The grand source of Indian literature," (fays Mr. Halhed, the
first Englishman who acquired the knowledge of Sanfkreet,)
" the parent of almost every dialeCt from the Persian gulf to
" the China seas, is the Sanfkreet, a language of the most ve-

nerable and unfathomable antiquity; which, although, at

" present, lhut up in the libraries of Brahmins, and appropri-
" ated solely to the records of their religion, appears to
" have been current over most of the Oriental world; and
" traces of its original extent may fill be discovered in almost
"every diftria of Asia. I have been often astonished to find
" the similitude of Sanfkreet words with those of Persian and
"Arabic, and even of Latin and Greek; and those not in
"techiical and metaphorical terms, which the mutuation of
"refined arts and improved manners might have occasionally
"introduced, but in the ground-work of language, in mo-
"nofyllables, in the names of numbers, and the appellations of
"such things as would be firt diScriminated on the immediate
" dawn of civilization. The resemblance which may be ob.
" served in the characters on the medals and signets of various
"difirits of Asia, the light which they reciprocally reflect
"upon each other, and the general analogy which they all bear
"to the fame grand prototype, afford another ample field for cu-
"riofity. The coins of Assam, Napaul, Calhmeere, and many
"other kingdoms, are all samped with Sanfkreet characters,
"and mofily contain allusions to the old Sanfkreet mythology.
" The fame conformity I have observed on the inpreflfion of
" feals from Bootan and Thibet. A collateral inference may
"likewise be deduced from the peculiar arrangement of the
" Sanfkreet alphabet, so very different from that of any other

Z z 2 " quarter

35s

" quarter of the world. This extraordinary mode of combi-
" nation fill exists in the greateft'part of the East, from the
"Indus to Pegu, in dialets now apparently unconne&ed, and
" in chara&ers completely dissimilar; and it is a forcible argu.
" ment that they are all derived from the fame source. Another
" channel of speculation presents itself in the names of persons
"and places, of titles and dignities, which are open to general
"notice, and in which, to the farthest limits of Asia, may be
" found manifest traces of the Sanlkreet." Preface to the
Grammar of the Bengal Language, p. 3. After this curious
account of the Sanfkreet tongue, I proceed to enumerate the
works which have been translated from it, besides the two men-
tioned in the text.-I. To Mr. Wilkins we are indebted for
1!{rc(-pidci or Amicable la/lruaion, in a series of conneced
fables, interspersed with moral, prudential, and political max-
ims. This work is in such high esteem throughout the East,
that it has been translated into every language spoken there.
It did not escape the notice of the Emperor Akber, attentive to
every thing that could contribute to promote useful knowledge.
He direced his Vizier, Abul Fazel, to put it into a flyle suited
to all capacities, and to illustrate the obscure passages in it,
which he accordingly did, and gave it the title of, The Crite-
rion of itfdaom. At length, there fables made their way into
Europe, and have been circulated there with additions and al-
terations, under the names of Pilpay and Efop. Many of the
Sanikrect apologues are ingenious and beautiful, and have been
copied or imitated by the fabulists of other nations. But in
some of them the charaters of the animals introduced are very
ill fultained; to describe a tyger as extremely devout, and prac-

3 tiring

tifng charity, and other religious duties, p. 16. or an old
mouse well read in the Neetee Saqlras, i. e. Systems of morality
and policy, p. 24.; a cat who read religious books, p. 35, &c.
discovers a want of taste, and an inattention to propriety.
Many of the moral sayings, if confidered as detached maxims,
are founded upon a thorough knowledge of life and manners,
and convey inftrudion with elegant simplicity. But the at-
tempt of the author to form his work into a connected series of
fables, and his mode of interweaving with them such a num-
ber of moral refletions in prose and in verse, renders the
ftruCure of the whole so artificial that the perusal of it
becomes often unpleasant. Akber was so sensible of this, that,
among other inftru&ions, he advises his Vizier to abridge the
long digressions in that work. By these ftri&ures it is far from
my intention to detract in the smallest degree from the merit of
Mr. Wilkins. His country is much indebted to him for hav-
ing opened a new source of science and taRe. The celebrity
of the Heeto-pades, as well as its intrinsic merit, notwithitanding
the defects which I have mentioned,juftify his choice of it, as a
work worthy of being made known to Europe in its original form.
From reading this and his other translations, no man will refuse
him the praise, to which he modestly confines his pretensions,
" of having drawn a pidure which we suppose to be a
" true likeness, although we are unacquainted with the origi-
" nal." Pref. p. xiv.-2. In the first number of the New
Asiatic Miscellany, we have a translation of a celebrated com-
position in the East, known by the title of the Five Gems. It
consists of stanzas by five poets who attended the court of
Abiffura, King of Bengal. Some of these Ranzas are simple

and

357

and elegant.-3. An ode translated from Wulli; in which that
extravagance of fancy, and those far-fetched and unnatural
conceits, which so often disgust Europeans with the poetical
compositions of the East, abound too much. The editor has
not informed us to whose knowledge of the Sanikreet we are
indebted for there two translations.-4. Some original grants
of land, of very ancient dates, translated by Mr. Wilkins. It
may seem odd, that a charter of legal conveyance of property
should be ranked among the literary compositions of any peo-
ple. But so widely do the manners of the Hindoos differ from
those of Europe, that as our lawyers multiply words and
clauses, in order to render a grant complete, and to guard
against every thing that may invalidate it, the Pundits seem to
dispatch the legal part of the deed with brevity, but, in a long
preamble and conclusion, make an extraordinary display of
their own learning, eloquence, and powers of composition,
both in prose and in verse. The preamble to one of these deeds
is an encomium of the monarch who grants the land, in a bold
strain of Eastem exaggeration: " When his innumerable army
" marched, the heavens were so filled with the dust of their feet
" that the birds of the air could reft upon it." " His elephants
" moved like walking mountains, and the earth, oppressed by
" their weight, mouldered into dust." It concludes with de-
nouncing vengeance against those who should venture to infringe
this grant: " Riches and the life of man are as transient as drops
" of water upon a leaf of the lotus. Learning this truth, O
" man, do not attempt to deprive another of his property."
Asiatic Researches, vol. i. p. 123, &c. The other grant, which
appears to be still more ancient, is not less remarkable. Both

2 were
358

were found engraved on plates of copper. Ib. p. 357, &c.-
5. The translation of part of the ShaRter, publilhed by Colonel
Dow, in the year 1768, ought perhaps to have been first men-
tioned. But as this translation was not made by him from the
Sanfkreet, but taken from the mouth of a Brahmin, who ex-
plained the Shafter in Persian, or in the vulgar language of
Bengal, it will fall more properly under notice when we come
to inquire into the slate of science among the Hindoos, than in
this place, where we are endeavouring to give some idea
of their tafle in composition.

NOTE X. p. 303.

As many of my readers may be unacquainted with the ex-

travagant length of the four aras or periods of Indian chrono-
logy, it my be proper to give an account of them from Mr.
Halhed's Preface to the Code of Gentoo Laws, p. xxxvi.

I. TE Sullttee 7ogne (or age of purity) is said to have

lasted three million two hundred thousand years, and they hold
that the life of man was extended in that age to one hundred
thousand years, and that his fature was twenty-one cubits.

2. THE Tirtab Jogue (in which one third of mankind was

corrupted) they suppose to have consisted of two million four
hundred thousand years, and that men lived to the age of ten
thousand years.

3. TuE

359

3. TiE D'wapaar Jogue (in which half of the human race

became depraved) endured one million fix hundred thousand
years, and the life of man was then reduced to a thousand
years.

4. THE Collee sogue (in which all mankind are corrupted,

or rather lessened, for that is the true meaning of Collee) is the
present ara, which they suppose ordained to subsist four hun-
dred thousand years, of which near five thousand are already
paR, and the life of man in that period is limited to one hun-
dred years.

IF we suppose the computation of time in the Indian chro-

nology to be made by solar or even by lunar years, nothing
can be more extravagant in itself, or more repugnant to our
mode of calculating the duration of the world, founded on
sacred and infallible authority. Some attempts have been
made by learned men, particularly by M. Bailly, in a very
ingenious dissertation on that fubje&, to bring the chronology
of the Hindoos to accord somewhat better with that of the
Old Testament; but, as I could not explain the principles
upon which he founds his conclusions, without entering into
long and intricate discussions foreign from the subjea of this
Dissertation, and as I cannot assent to some of his opinions, I
lhall reft satisfied with referring to his Astron. Indienne, Disc.
Prelim. p. lxxvii. and leave my readers to judge for them-
selves. I am happy to observe that a Memoir on the Chrono-
logy of the Hindoos will be publilhed in the Second Volume
of the Traniaftions of the Society of Bengal, and I hope that

some
s6o

some learned member of that body will be able, from his ac-
quaintance with the languages and history of the country, to
throw light upon a subjea which its connecion with religion
and science renders extremely interefing. From one circum-
stance, however, which merits attention, we may conclude,
that the information which we have hitherto received concern-
ing the chronology of the Hindoos is very incorret.' We
have, as far as I know, only five original accounts of the dif-
ferent Jogues or eras of the Hindoos. The first is given by
M. Roger, who received it from the Brahmins on the Coro-

sand years; the Dwapaar Jogue is eight hundred and fixty-four
thousand. The duration of the Collee Jogue he does not specify.
Porte Ouverte, p. 179. The next is that of M. Bernier, who
received it from the Brahmins of Benares. According to him,
the duration of the Suttee Jogue was two million five hundred
thousand years; that of the Tirtah Jogue one million two hun-
dred thousand years; that of the Dwapaar Jogue is eight hun-
dred and fixty-four thousand years. Concerning the period of
the Collee Jogue, he, likewise, is silent. Voyages, tom. ii.
p. 16o. The third is that of Colonel Dow, according to which
the Suttee Jogue is a period of fourteen million of years; the
Tirtah Jogue one million eighty thousand; the Dwapaar Jogue
feventy-two thousand; and the Collee Jogue thirty-fix thou-
sand years. Hist. of Hindoft. vol. i. p. 2. The fourth account
is that of M. Le Gentil, who received it from the Brahmins of
the Coromandel coast, and as his information was acquired in

3A the

361

the fame part of India, and derived from the fame source with
that of M. Roger, it agrees with his in every particular. Mem. de
l'Academ. des Sciences pour 1772, tom. ii. part i. p. 176.
The fifth is the account of Mr. Halhed, which I have already
given. From this discrepancy, not only of the total numbers,
but of. many of the articles in the different accounts, it is ma-
nifeft that our information concerning Indian chronology is hi-
therto as uncertain as the whole system of it is wild and fabulous.
To me it appears highly probable; that when we underfiand more
thoroughly the principles upon which the facitious xras or
Jogucs of the Hindoos have been formed, that we may be more
able to reconcile their chronology to the true mode of comput-
ing time, founded on the authority of the Old Testament; and
may likewise find reason to conclude, that the account givenby
their afironomers of the situation of the heavenly bodies at the
beginning of the Collee Jogue, is not established by acual obfer-
vation, but the result of a retrofpetive calculation. Whoever
undertakes to investigate farther the chronology of the Hindoos,
will derive great afliftance from a Memoir of Mr. Marfden on that
subjed, in which he has explained the nature of theiryear, and
the several aras in use among them, with much ingenuity and
precision. Philof. Tranfat. vol. Ixxx. part ii. p. 56o.

NOTE XI. p. 31I.

IN the public buildings of India, we find proofs and monu-

ments of the proficiency of the Brahmins in science, particu-
larly of their attention to astronomical observation. Their re-

ligion
362

liglon enjoins, that the four fides of a Pagoda flould face the
four cardinal points. In order to execute this with accuracy, they
take a method described by M. le Gentil, which discovers a
considerable degree of science. He carefully examined the
position of one of their Pagodas, and found it to be perfeAly
exa. Voy. tom. i. p. 133, &c. As some of their Pagodas
are very ancient, they must have early attained such a portion
of knowledge as was requisite for placing them properly. On
the ceilings of Choultrys, and other ancient edifices, the
twelve signs of the zodiac are often delineated; and, from
their resemblance to those which are now universally uled, it
is highly probable that the knowledge of there arbitrary symbols
was derived from the East. Colonel Call has publilhed a
drawing of the signs of the zodiac, which he found on the
ceiling of a Choultry at Verdapettah, in the Madura country.
Phil. Tranfac. vol. Ixii. p. 353. I have a drawing of them
in my pofteffion, differing from his in some of the figures, but
I cannot fay in what particular place it was found. Sir Robert
Barker describes an observatory at Benares, which he visited
A. D. 1772. In it he found instruments for astronomical ob-
servation, of very large dimensions, and conftruted with great
skill and ingenuity. Of all there he has published drawings.
Phil. Tranfatc. vol. Ixvii. p. 598. According to traditionary
account, this observatory was built by the Emperor Akbcr.
The view which Sir Robert took of it was an hasty one. It
merits a more attentive infpeaion, in order to determine whe-
ther it was confruled by Akber, or ereted in some more
early period. Sir Robert intimates, that none but Brahmins
who underRfood the Sanfkreet, and could consult the aftrono-

3 A 2 mical

363

mical tables written in that language, were capable of calcu-
lating edipfes P. Tiefenthaler describes, in a very cursory
manner, two observatories furnihed with instruments of extra-
ordinary magnitude, at Jepour and Ougein, in the country of
Malwa. Bernouilli, tom. i. p. 316. 347. But these are mo-
dem ftrutures.
