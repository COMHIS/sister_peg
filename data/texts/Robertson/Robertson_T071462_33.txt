As the day appointed for the meeting. o Par-. o i

employed in deliberating concerning the course '65.

which it was mos proper to, hold with regard to liberations
the exiled nobles. Many motives prompted her concerning
to set no bounds to the rigor of justice. The th ,,blx.
malecontents had labored to defeat a scheme,
which her interest conspired with her passions in
rendering dear to her; they were the leaders of a
party, whose friendlhip the had been obliged to
court, while she held their principles in abhor-
rence; and they were firmly attached to a-rival,
whom the had good reason both to fear and to hate,

But, on the other hand, several weighty con.
fiderations might be urged. The noblemen whose
fate was in rufpenfe, were among the most power-

it, jcds of'compallion, and suing for pardon with

' the molt humble fubmiflion.

In those circumRoances, an aa of clemency

"would exalt the Queen's chara&er, and appear no
less fplndid among foreigners, than acceptable to
be'owvn fubjets. Mary herself, though highly
inccnfed, was not inexorable; but the King's rage
was implacable and unrelenting. They were so-
licited in behalf of the fugitives from various
quarters. Morton, Ruthven, Maitland, and all
who had been members of the Congregation, were
not forgetful of their ancient union with Murray,
and his fellow-fufferers, nor negletful of their
safety, which they deemed of great importance
to the kingdom. Melvil, who at that time pof.
sessed the Queen's confidence, seconded their ho,
licitations. And Murray, having Rlooped so low
as to court Rizio, that favorite, who was de.
firous of securing his protection againlt the King,
whose displeasure he had lately incurred, seconded
the intercessions of his other friends with the
whole of his influence '. The interposition of
Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, who had lately been
Eliztbeth's Ambafiador in Scotland, in behalf of
the exiles, was of more weight than all these, and
attended with more success. Throgmorton, out
of enmity to Cecil, had embarked deeply in all
the intrigues which were carried on at the Eng.
lih court, in order to undermine the power and
credit of that minister. He espouscd, for this

reason, the cause of the Scottish Queen, towards BOOK
whose title and pretensions the other was known Iv.
to bear little favor; and ventured, in the present 1566.
critical jundure, to write a letter to Mary, con-
taining the most salutary advices with regard to
her conduct. He recommended the pardoning
of the Earl of Murray, and his associates, as a
measure no less prudent than popular. " An
action of this nature, fays he, the pure effec of
your Majesty's generosity, will spread the fame of
yourlenity and moderation, and engage the Englihf
to look towards your accession to their throne,
not only without prejudice, but with desire. By
the fame means, a perfect harmony will be reftor.
ed among your own subjects, who, if any rupture
lhould happen with England, will serve you with
that grateful zeal, which your clemency cannot
fail of inspiring ' ".

These prudent remonstrances of Throgmorton, She troly
to which his reputation for wisdom, and known to tiru
attachment to the Queen, added great authority, clem,,*.
made a deep impression on her spirit. Her cour-
tiers cultivated this happy disposition, and pre.
vailed on her, notwithstanding the King's in-
flexible temper, to sacrifice her own private re.
fentment to the interceflion of her fubjets, and
the wishes of her friends '. With this view, the
Parliament, which had been called to meet on the
fourth of February, was prorogued to the seventh
of April'; and in the mean time, fle was busy in

idiet~r Though Mary discovered, 6n this occaion, a
fo^tio. nmind naturally prone to humanity, and capable
b» tbe rol- of forgiving, she wanted firrtnets, however, to

"ia of refi the influence, *hich was fataly employed

rNsece, and
bs zeu foi to disappoint the effets of this amiable difpofi.
rotS. tion. About this time, and at no great distance

fronreach other, two envoys arrived from the
'L'b, -. French King. The former Was intrusted with

matters of mere ceremony alone; he congratulated
the Queen on her marriage, and invested the King
with the ensigns of the order of St. Michael. The
inftrudions of the latter related to matters of
more importance, and produced greater effe&s '.

An interview between Charles IX and his

Sifter the Queen of Spain had been often pro.
posed; and after many obstacles aifing from the
oppolition of political interest , was at lar ap.
pointed at Bayonne. Catherine of Medicis ac;
companied her son; the Duke of Alva attended
his Mistress. Amidst the scenes of public pomp
and pleasure, which seemed to be the sole occu-
pation of both courts, a scheme was formed, and
mearures concerted, for exterminating the Hu.
gonots in France, the Protestants in the Low
Countries, and for suppressing the Reformation
throughout all Europe'. The adive policy ol

so suitable to the genius of the Ropmil religion, Iv.
and so beneficial to their own order. I$6s.

It was an. account of this holy league which
the second French envoy brought to Mary, con-
juring her, at the, fatpe time, in the name of the
King of France and the, Cardinal. of Lorraio,
not to restore the leaders of the ProteRfants in
her kingdom to power and favor, at the very
time when the Catholic Princes were combined to
dtftroy that set in all.the countries of Europe '.

Popery is a species of fNlfe religion, remark-
able for the fIrong poflelfion it takes of the heart.
Contrived by men of deep infight in the human
charader, and. improved by, the, experience and
observation of, many,fucceffive ages; it arrived at
lal to a degrce..of perfecion, which no. former
system of superstition had ever, attained.. There
is no power.in ,the understanding. and no passion
in the heart, to which it. does not present obje&t,
ad(.pted to rouse, and to intereR.thegn. Neither
the love of pleafurq, which, at,that time, pre-
vailed in the court, of France, nor the pursuits of
ambition which occupied the court of Spain, had
secured them fromthe dominion of bigotry. Lay-
men and courtiers were agitated with that furious.
and unmerciful zeal which is commonly confi-
dered as peculiar to ecclesiastics; and Kings andi
Miniters thought themselves bound, in con-
kience, to extirpate the Protestant dotrine. Mary
berfelf was deeply tindured with. all the precj.

B 00 K dices of Popery; a passionate attachment to that

Iv. superstition is visible in every part of her char.
»6 adter, and runs through all the scenes of her life:

She was devoted, too, with the utmof fubrnit
sion to the Princes of Lorrain, her uncles; and
had been accustomed, from her infancy, to liften
to all their advices with a filial refped. The
profpec of restoring the public exercise of her
own religion, the pleasure of complying with
her uncles, and the hopes of gratifying the
French Monarch, whom the present situation of
her affairs in England made it necessary to court,
counterbalanced all the prudent considerations
which bad formerly weighed with her. She in.
ftantly joined the confederacy, which had been
formed for the deftrudion of the Protestants, and
altered the whole plan of her conduct with regard
to Murray and his adherents '.

To this fatal resolution may be imputed all the

subsequent calamities of Mary's life. Ever finct
her return into Scotland, fortune may be said
to have been propitious to her, rather than
adverse; and if her prosperity did not rife tc
any great height, it had, however, suffered nc
considerable interruption. A thick and fettlec
cloud of adversity, with few gleams of hope, an(
none of real enjoyment, covers the remainder o
her days.

The effects of the new fyRtem, which Mary ha

adopted, were soon visible. The time of the pt

condition of the unhappy person who luffered,

, P,,. the event is little remarkable; but if we reflec

progress of it deserve to be traced with great care,

Darn.To hrs Darnly's external accomplilhments had excit.
'he Q0"" ' ed that sudden and violent paflion which raised

him to the throne. But the qualities of his
mind corresponded ill with the beauty of his
person. Of a weak understanding, and with.
out experience, conceited, at the fame time of
his own abilities, and ascribing his extraordinary
success entirely to his diftinguilhed merit. All
the Queen's favor made no impression on such
a temper. All her gentleness could not bridle
his imperious and ungovernable spirit. All her
attention to place about him persons capable
of direding his condudt, could not preserve him
from ralh and imprudent acions ". Fond of all
the amusements, and even prone to all the vice!
of youth, he became, by degrees, careless of
her person, and a firanger to her company. T(
a woman, and a Queen, such behaviour waa
intolerable. The lower she had ilooped in order

to raise him, his behaviour appeared the more B OO K
ungenerous and criminal: and in proportion to Iv.
the strength of her first affecion, was the vio. isc6.
lence with which her disappointed passion now
operated. A few months after the marriage,
their domestic quarrels began to be observed.
The extravagance of Darnly's ambition gave rife
to these. Instead of being satisfied with a liare
in the adminiflration of government, or with the
title of King, which Mary, by an unprecedented
flretch of power, had conferred on himi, he de-
manded the Crown Matrimonial with most in,
solent importunity ". Though Mary alledged that
this gift was beyond her power, and tha.t the au.
thority of Parliament mulf be interposed to be-
flow it, he wanted either understanding to com.
prehend, or temper to admit, so just a defence;
and often renewed and urged his request.

Rizio, whom the King had at first taken into. Sln-t
great confidence, did not humor him in these l'RiC"
follies. By this he incurred Henry's difpleafilre; Vfit.
and as it was impossible for Mary to behave to-
wards her. husband with the fame affection which
diltinguifhed the first and happy days of their
union, he imputed this coldness, not to his own
behaviour, which had so well merited it, but to
the insinuations of Rizio. Alary's own conduct
confirmed and strengthened there suspicions. She

VY. mitted him to a lhare in her confidence, to which
s5. neither his first condition, nor the office The bad

lately bellowed on him, gave him any title. He
was perpetually in her presence, intermeddled in
every bufines, and, together with a few favorites
was the companion of all her private amusements
The haughty spirit of Darnly could not bear the
intrusion of such an upstart; and impatient of any
delay, and unrestrained by any scruple, he iotanly
resolved to get rid of him by violence.

iiziolhu- At the fame time, another design, which took
fri rt its rife from very different motives, was carrying
the. ,ii on against the life of Rizio. Morton, Ruthven,
"ebitL Lindsay, and Maitland, were the contrivers of it.

In all former commotions they had been ftricly
united with Murray, though in the late infur.
redion they had deserted him, for various reasons.
Morton was nearly allied to the family of Angus,
and, during the minority of the present Earl, aded
as chief of the name of Douglas. Ruthven was
married to the King's aunt. Lindsay's wife wa
of the fame blood. All these had warmly con-
curred with the Queen in promoting a marriige
which did so much honor to the house of Doe
glas, and naturally expected, that, under a KIinD
of their own blood, the chief management ct
affairs would be committed to them. Maitland,
with his usual sagacity, foresaw that Murray's op
position to the match would prove dangerous ai:l
ineffectual; but whoever ruled at court, he hopetl,
by his dexterity and talents, to render himlfl

necessary and of importance. They were all equally B o 0O
disappointed in their expecations. The King's I.
headstrong temper rendered him incapable of ad- sit.
vice. The Queen could not help distrusting men
who had been so long and so intimately connected
with Murray, and gave herself up entirely to such
Counsellors as complied with all her inclinations.
The return of that nobleman and his followers
was therefore the only event which could restore
Morton, Maitland, and their associates to their
former ascendant over the Queen's councils. For
this reason, nothing could be more mortifying to
them, than the resolution which Mary had taken
to treat the exiles with rigor. This they imputed
to Rizio, who, after he'had engaged to aid Murray
with all his interest, was now the most aCive
instrument in promoting the measures which were
concerted for the ruin of that nobleman. This
officious zeal completed the disgust which they had
conceived against him, and inspired them with
thoughts of vengeance in no wife suitable tojuftice,
to humanity, or to their own dignity.

While they were ruminating upon their scheme, Th'e con.
the King communicated his resolution to be I'" in or.
avenged of Rizio to Lord Ruthven, and im- ,dr him.
plored his affifance, and that of his friends, to.
wards the execution of this design. Nothing
could be more acceptable to them than this over-
ture. They saw at once all the advantages they
would reap, by the concurrence of such an affo.
ciate. Their own private revenge upon Rizio
"ould pass, they hoped, for an acd of obedience

X 0 o l to the king; and they did not despair of obtaining

Iv. the restoration of their banifbed friends, and fecur.
s., kity for the Proteflant religion, as the price of their

compliance with his will.

But as Henry was no left fickle than rafhl, they

hesitated for.fome time, and determined to advance
no farther, without taking every possible precaution
for their own safety. They did not, in the mean
time, susser the King's resentment to abate. Morton,
who was inferior to no man of that intriguing age
in all the arts of insinuation and address, took
the young Prince under his management. He
wrought upon his ruling pafion, ambition to obtain
the Matrironial Crown. He represented Rizlo's
credit with the Queen to be the chief and only
obftack to his success in that demand; This minion.
alone, he said, pofeffed her confidence; and out of
complaisance to him, her tubjefs, her nobility,
and even her husband, were excluded from any par.
ticipation of her secret councils. Under the appear-
ance of a confidence merely political, he insinuated,
and the King perhaps believed, that a familiarity
of a quite different and very criminal nature mihit
be conceakd ". Such various and- complicattd

fettled on both fides, and articles for their mutual
fcctrity agreed upon. The King engaged to prevent
the attainder of the banihbed Lards, to consent to
their return into Scotland, to obtain for them an
ample remission of all their crimes, and totupport to
the utmost of his power, the religion which was
now eRablilled in the kingdom. On their parts,

it appears almost i;npoffible that the Queen, unless we suppose
her to have been a woman utterly abandoned, could carry on
any criminal intrigue with Rizio. But the silence of Randolph,
(I'e English Resident, a man abundantly ready to mentiori,

ledge himself to be the author of the enterprise,
and to protect those who were embarked in it".

.rtr~te Nothing now remained but to concert the

in tmh plan of operation, to chufe the adors, and to a.
Qe',s sign them their parts in perpetrating this deteRable
Panlam crime. Every circumstance here paints and cha.

rafterizes the manners and men of that age, and
fills us with horror at both. The place chosen
for committing such a deed, was the Queen's bed.
chamber. Though Mary was now in the sixth
month of her pregnancy, and though Rizio might
have been seized elsewhere without any difficulty,
the King pitched upon this place, that he might
enjoy the malicious pleasure of reproaching Rizio
with his crimes before the Queen's face. The
Earl of Morton, the Lord High Chancellor of
the kingdom, undertook to direct an enterprise,
carried on in defiance of all the laws of which
he was bound to be the guardian. The Lord
Ruthven, who had been confined to his bed for
three months, by a very dangerous distemper, and
who was fill so feeble that he could hardly walk,
or bear the weight of his own armour, was in.
truRed with the executive part; and while he
bimfelf needed to be supported by two men, he

came abroad to commit a murder in the presence B o o K
of his Sovereign. iv.

On the ninth of March, Morton entered the court tis.
of the palace with a hundred and sixty men; and
without noise, or meeting with any resistance;
flizd all the gates. While 'the Queen was at supper
with the Countels of Argyll, Ritio, and a few
domestics, the King suddenly entered the apartment
by a private passage. At his back was Ruthven,
clad in complete armour, and with that ghastly and
horrid look which long sickness hail given him. Three
or four of his most trufy accomplices followed him.
Such an unuTual appearance alarmed those who were
present. Rizio instantly apprehended that he was
the victim at whom the blow was aimed; and in
the utmost consternation retired behind the Queen,
of whom he laid hold, hoping that the reverence
due to her person might prove some proteaion to
him. The conspirators had proceeded too far to be
restrained by any consideration of that kind. Num-
bers of armed men rulhed into the chamber. Ruthven
drew his dagger, and with a furious mien and voice,
commanded Rizio to leave a place of which he was
unworthy, and which he had occupied too long.
Mary employed tears, and, intreaties, and threat.
enings, to save her favorite. But, notwithstanding
all there, he was torn from her by violence, and
before he could be dragged through the next apart-
ment, the rage of his enemies put an end to his
life, piercing his body with fifty-fix wounds".

Iv. the Queen who had apartments in the palace, were
s. a alarmed at the uproar, aad filled with the utmost

terror on their own account; but either no violence
was intended againf them, or the conspirators durst
not shed the noblest blood in the kingdom, in the
fame illegal manner with which they had ventured
to take the life of a stranger. Some of them were
dismissed, and others made their escape.

Tble caao, The conTpirators, in the mean time, kept poleflion

utmost care. A proclamation was published by the
King, prohibiting the parliament to meet on the day

Edinburgh, at the head of eight thousand men,
talked in the highest Rrain of resentment and re.

days before.

No man so remarkable for wisdom, and even

for cunning, as the Earl of Morton, ever en-
gaged in a more unfortunate enterprise. Desert.

one of the molt opulent fortunes in the kingdom.

On her return to Edinburgh, Mary began to
proceed against those concerned in the murder of

Rizio, with the utmost rigor of law. But, in Boo t
praif of her clemency, it must be observed, that Iv.
only two persons, and these of no considerable s66.
rank, suffered for this crime ".

In this conspiracy there is one circumfance,
which, though somewhat detached, deserves not
to be forgotten. In the confederacy between the
King and the conspirators, the real intention of
which was affaflination, the preserving of the Re-
formed Church is, nevertheless, one of the most
considerable articles; and the fame men who were
preparing to violate one of the first duties of mo-
rality, affected the highest regard for religion.
History relates these extravagances of the human
mind, without pretending to justify, or even to
account for them; and regulating her own opinions

:ice so Ihocking to humanity, deserve our parti-
cular attention. Resentment is, for obvious and
wife reasons, one of the firongeft paflions in the
human mind. The natural demand of this pas
sion is, that the person who feels the injury thould
himself inflict the vengeance due on that account.
The permitting this, however, would have been

16M tion. For this reason , in the very infancy of the

social Rate, the sword was taken out of private
hands, and committed to the Magistrate. But at
firrf, while laws aimed at restraining, they really
strengthened the principle of revenge. The earlief
and most simple punlhment for crimes was reta.
liation; the offender forfeited limb for limb, and
life for life. The payment of a compensation to
the person injured, succeeded to the rigor of the
former infitution. In both these, the gratification
of private revenge was the object of law; and he
who suffered the wrong, was the only person who
had a right to pursue, to exat, or to remit the
puniflment. While laws allowed such full scope
to the revenge of one party, the interests of the
other were not negleted. If the evidence of his
guilt did not amount to a full proof, or if he rec-
koned himself to be unjufly accused, the person
to whom a crime was imputed had a right to'chal
lenge his adversary to single combat, and, on ob-
taining the victory, vindicated his own honor.
In almost every ceofiderable cause, whether civil
or criminal, arms were appealed to, in defence,
either of the innocence, or the property of the par.
ties. Justice had seldom occasion to use her balance;
the sword alone decided every contest. The pai.
sion of revenge was nourilhed by all there means,
and grew, by daily indulgence, to be incredibly
strong. Mankind became habituated to blood,
not only in times of war, but of peace; and from

t

this, as well as other causes, contracted an amaz. B o o K
ing ferocity of temper and of manners. This fero. iv.
city, however, made it necessary to discourage s64.
the trial by combat; to abolish the payment of
compensations in criminal cafes; and to think of
some milder method of terminating disputes con-
cerning civil rights. The punishment for crimes
became more severe, and the regulations concern-
ing property more fixed; but the Princes, whose
province it was to inflict the one, and to enforce
the other, pofleffed little power. Great offenders
despised their authority; smaller ones sheltered them-
selves under the jurisdiction of those from whose pro-
tedion they expected impunity. The administration
of justice was extremely feeble and dilatory. An
attempt to punish the crimes of a Chieftain, or even
of his vassals, often excited rebellions and civil
wars. To nobles, haughty and independent, among
whom the causes of discord were many and una-
voidable, -who were quick in discerning an in-
jury, and impatient to revenge it; who deemed
it infamous to submit to an enemy, and cowardly
to forgive him; who confidered the right of pu.
ninling those who had injured them, as a privi.
lege of their order, and a mark of independence;
such flow proceedings were extremely unfatisfac-
tory. The blood of their adversary was, in their
opinion, the only thing which could waflh away
an affront; where that was not (hed, their revenge
was disappointed, their courage became fufpeted,
and a Rain was left on their honor. That vengeance,
which the important hand of the Magistrate could not

a o o x inflid, their own could easily execute. Under go

IV. vernments so feeble, men assumed, as in a Rate of
*1M nature, the right of judging, and redrefling their

own wrongs; and thus aflaflination, a crime of all
others the most deftrudive to society, came not only
to be allowed, but to be reckoned honorable.

The history of Europe, during the fourteenth

and fifteenth centuries, abounds with detestable
instances of this crime. It prevailed chiefly among
the French and Scots, between whom there was a
clote intercourse at that time, and a surprising refem.
blance in their national characers. In one thousand
four hundred and seven, the bnly brother of the
King of France was murdered publicly in the freets
ofParis; and so far was this horrible acion from meet-
ing with proper punisfment, that an eminent lawyer
was allowed to plead in defence of it before the
Pees of France, and avowedly to maintain the law.
fulness of assassination. In one thousand four hun-
dred and seventeen, it required all the eloquence
and authority of the famous Gerfon, to prevail on
the Council of Conltance to condemn this pro.
position, " That there are some cafes in which a.
faination is a virtue more meritorious in a Knight
than in a Squire, and more meritorious in a King
than in a Knight"." The number of eminent per.
ions who were murdered in France and Scotland, on
tccount either of private, or political, or religious
quarrels, during the fifteenth and fixtecnth centuries,
is almof incredible. Even after those causes, which

moved; after the jurifdiclion of MagiRrates, and Iv.
the authority of laws, were better eftablilhed, and 156ó.
become more universal; after the progress of learn-
ing and philosophy had polished the manners, and
humanized the minds of men, this crime continued
in some degree. It was towards the close of the
seventeenth century before it disappeared in France.
The additional vigor which the royal authority ac-
quired by the acceflion of James V to the throne of
England, seems to have put a stop to it in Scotland.

'he influence, however, of any national cuf
tom, both on the undertanding and on the heart,
and how far it may go towards perverting or ex-
tinguilhing moral principles of the greatest im-
portance, is remarkable. The authors of those
ages have perfectly imbibed the sentiments of
their cotemporaries, with regard to aifafilation;
and they, who had leisure to reflet, and to judge,
appear to be no more shocked at this crime, than
the persons who committed it during the heat
and impetuosity of passion. Buchanan describes
the murder of Cardinal Beatoun, and of Rizio,
without exprefling those feelings which are na-
tural to a man, or that indignation which became
a historian ". Knox, whose mind was fierce
and more unpolifhed, relates the death of Bca.
toun and of the Duke of Guise, not only without
censure, but with the utmofl exultation". On
the other hand, the Bilhop of Ross mentions the

2*5& with the moRs indecent triumph, and ascribes it

the principal attor in the conspiracy against Rizio,
wrote an account of it some short time before
his own death, and in all his long narrative there
is not one expreflion of regret, or one symptom
of compundion, for a crime no less dilbonorable
than barbarous ". Morton, equally guilty of the
fame crime, entertained the fame sentiments con.
cerning it; and in his last moments, neither he
himself, nor the Ministers who attended him, seem
to have confidered it as an adion which called for
repentance; even then he talks of David' slaughter as
coolly as if it had been an innocent or commendable
deed ". The vices of another age aRonihf and ihock

Queen was fully convinced, that he was not
only accessary to the contrivance, but to the conm
million of that odious crime ". That very power
which, with liberal and unfufpicious fondness%
she had conferred upon him, he had employed
to insult her authority, to limit her prerogative,
and to endanger her person. Such an outrage,
it was impossible any woman could bear or forL

quarrels, succeeded to their former transports of
affecion and confidence. The Queen's favors
were no longer conveyed through his hands.
The crowd of expe&ants ceased to court his
patronage, which they found to avail so little.
Among the nobles, some dreaded his furious
temper, others complained of his perfidious-
ness; and all of them despised the weakness
of his understanding, and the inconstancy of
his heart. The people themselves observed some
are puerile: " Fraterculus quidam, nomine Black, Papist-

forced tears from her eyes, both in public and in
private ". Her aversion for him increased every

of the most powerful noblemen in the kingdom.
Even in that turbulent age, when so many vas

1as. seized her person, he became the chief intrument

of recovering her liberty, and served her, on that
occasion, with so much fidelity and fuccefi, as
made the deepest impreffon on her mind, and
greatly increased the confidence which she had hi.
therto placed in him ". Her gratitude loaded him
with marks of her bounty; she raised him to offices
of profit and of trust, and tranfaded no matter of

them, and drew from them a promise to bury
their discords in evcrlafting oblivion. This re-
concilement Mary had so much at heart, that lhe
made it the condition on which The again received
Mlurray into favor ".

On the nineteenth of June, Mary was delivered Birth or
of her only son James, a Prince whose birth was Jmts VI1
happy for the whole ifand, and unfortunate to
her alone. His acceflion to the throne of Eng-
land united the two divided kingdoms in one
mighty monarchy, and established the power of Great
Britain on a firm foundation. While fie, torn ear-
ly from her son by the cruelty of her fate, was
never allowed to indulge those tender paflions, nor
to taste those joys which fill the heart of a mother.

Melvil was instantly dispatched to London with
an account of this event. It struck Elizabeth,
at firt, in a sensible manner; and the advantage
and superiority which her rival had acquired.by
the birth of a son, forced tears from her eyes. But
before Melvil was admitted to audience, she
had so far recovered the command of herself, as
to receive him not only with decency, but with
excellive cheerfulness ; and willingly accepted
the invitation which Mary gave her, to hand
godmother to her son ".

But, at what precise time this ambitious Lord first Bothwlli
allowed the sentiments of a lover to occupy the inc're
place of that duty and respect which a subject
owes his Sovereign; or when Mary, instead of
gratitude for his faithful services, felt a pallion of
another nature rising in her bosom, it is no easy
matter to determine. Such delicate transitions of
pafions can be discerned only by those who are
admitted near the persons of the parties, and who
can view the secret workings of the heart withr
calm and acute observation. Neither Knox nor
Buchanan enjoyed these advantages. Their hum.
ble station allowed them only a distant access to
the Queen and her favorite. And the ardor of
their zeal, and the violence of their prejudices,
rendered their opinions rash, precipitate, and in-
accurate. It is by the effects of this reciprocal
padlion, rather than by their accounts of it, that
subsequent historians can judge of its reality.

Adventurous as Bothwell's project to gain the
Queen may appear, it was formed and carried on
under very favorable circumltances. Mary was
young, gay, and affable. She possessed great fen.
fibility of temper, and was capable of the utmost
tenderness of affection. She had placed her love
on a very unworthy object, who requited it with
ingratitude, and treated her with neglect, with
insolence, and with brutality. All these Ihe felt,

o O K and resented. In this situation, the attention and
Iv. complaisance of a man, who had vindicated her
s"& authority, and protedcd her person; who entered

into all her views, who soothed all her pafions,
who watched and improved every opportunity of
insinuating his design, and recommending his
palfion ', could hardly fail of making impreflion
on a heart of such a frame as Mary's.

Ie Mat The haughty spirit of Darnly, nursed up in

`", to flattery, and accustomed to command, could not
la. bear the contempt under which he had now

fallen, and the fate of insignificance to which he
saw himself reduced. Rut in a country where be
was universally hated or despised, he could never
hope to form a party, which would second any
attempt he might make to recover power. He
addressed himself, therefore, to the Pope, and to
the Kings of France and Spain, with many pro.
feflions of his own zeal for the Catholic religion,
and with bitter complaints against the Queen, for
neglecing to promote that interest ": And soon
after, he took a resolution, equally wild and
desperate, of embarking on board a lhip which,
he provided, and of flying into foreign parts.
I is almost impofible to form any fatisfadory
conjecture concerning the motives which influence
a capricious and irregular mind. He hoped,
perhaps, to recommend himself to the Catholic
Princes on the continent by his zeal for religion,
and that they would employ their iatereft towards

reinstating him in the possession of that power which n 0 o K
he had loft. Perhaps, he expected nothing more iv.
than the comfort of hiding the disgrace under which s166.
he was now fallen, among strangers, who had
never been witnesses of his former prosperity.

He communicated the dcfig to the French His capri.

Amb.iflador Le Croc, and to his father the Earl citisi beha
of Lenox. They both endeavoured to dissuade
him from it, but without success. Lenox, who
seems, as well as his son, to have loft the Queen's
confidence, and who, about this time, was fel-
dom at court, ilnftantly communicated the matter
to her by a letter. Henry, who had refused to
accompany the Queen from Stirling to Edin.
burgh, was likewise absent from court. He ar-
rived there, however, on the fame day she re-
ceived the account of his intended flight. But
he was more than usually wayward and peevilh;
and scrupling to enter the palace unless certain
Loids who attended the Queen were dismissed,
Mlary was obliged to meet him without the gates.
At las he suffered her to conduct him into her
own apartment. She endeavoured to draw from
him the reasons of the strange resolution which
he had taken, and to divert him from it. In
spite however of all her arguments and intreaties,
he remained silent and inflexible. Next day the
Privy Council, by her direction, expoftulated
with him on the fame head. He perCifted, not.
withtganding, in his sullenness and obstinacy;
and neither deigned to explain the motives of his
conduct, nor signified any intention of altering

Iv. the Queen, and told her, that she Ihould not fee

be wrote to Mary, and mentioned two things as
grounds of his difgut. She herself, he said, no
longer admitted him into any confidence, and had
deprived him of all power; and the nobles, after
her example, treated him with open neglef, to
that be appeared in every place without the dignity
and splendor of a King.

Nothing could be more mortifying to Mary,

,unt than this intended flight of the King's, which
LoeuM would have spread the infamy of their domeflic

quarrel all over Europe. Compafion for a Mo.
narch who would then appear to be forced into
exile by her neglet and ill usage, might have
disposed mankind to entertain sentiments con.
cerning the causes of their discord, little to her
advantage. In order, therefore, to prepolfels the
minds of her allies, and to screen her reputation from
any censure with which Darnly might endeavour
to load it, the Privy Council transmitted a narra.
tive of this whole tranfadion, both to the King
and to the Queen Mother of France. It is drawn
with great art, and sets Mary's condud in the
amos favorable point of light ".

Bothwell was, at that time, Lieutenant or Warden Iv.

portant in the kingdom; and though usually divided
into three diftind governments, bellowed by the
Queen's favor upon him alone. In order to display his
own valor and acivity in the discharge of this trust,
he attempted tofeize a gangof banditti, who, lurking
among the marahes of Liddefdale, infetled the reft
of the country. But while he was laying hold upon
one of those difperadoes, he was wounded by October u.

obliged to carry him to hermitage castle. Mary
inltantly flew thither, with an impatience which
has been confidered as marking the anxiety of a
lover, but little suited the dignity of a Queen .

her youth, and the vigor of her constitution, re.
sifted the malignity of her difeale. During the
continuance of the Queen's illness, the King, who
Novemb.s. resided at Stirling, never came near Jedburgh";

and when he afterwards thought fit to make his
appearance there, he met with such a cold recep.
tion, as did not encourage him to make any long
stay '. Mary soon recovered strength enough to
return along the eastern borders to Dunbar.

While she resided in this place, her attention

was turned towards England. Elizabeth, not-
withRfanding her promise, and even proclamations
to the contrary, not only allowed, but encouraged
IMorton and his associates to remain in England".
Alary, on the other hand, afforded her protection
to several English fugitives. Each Queen watched

appeared in the Parliament of England, and which Iv.
raised a florm that threatened Elizabeth's domestic '16.

and required all her art and dexterity to allay it.

Elizabeth had now reigned eight: years with.

violent diltemper, with which ale had lately been
seized, having endangered her life, and alarmed
the nation with the profpedt of all those calamities
which are occasioned by a disputed and dubious
fuccefiion; a motion was made, and eagerly lif-
tened to in both houses, for addrefling the Queen,
to provide against any such danger in times,,to
come, either by signifying her own resolution to
marry, or by consenting to an act, eftablilhing
the order of fuccefilon to the Crown '. Her
love to her subjects, her duty to the public, her
concern for posterity, it was asserted, not only
called upon, but obliged her to take one of there
fleps. The insuperable aversion which fle bad
all along discovered for marriage, made it -im-
probable that she would chufe the former; and
if fie complied with the latter request, no title to
the Crown could , with any color of justice, be
set in opposition to that of the Scottilh Queen.
Elizabeth was sagacious enough to fee the re-
moteft consequences of this motion, and observed
them with the greatest anxiety. Mary, by re-
fusing so often to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh,

tions, Ihe had gained many to favor her title".
All the Roman Catholics ardently witbed for her
fuccefion. Her gentleness and humanity had re.
moved many of those apprehensions which the
Protestants entertained on account of her religion.
The court-fadion, which envied the power of
Cecil, and endeavoured to wrest the administration
out of his hands, advanced the pretensions of the
Scottith Queen in opposition to him. The union of
the two kingdoms was a desirable objed to all
wife men in both nations; and the birth of the
young Prince was a security for the continuance
of this blefling. and gave hopes of its perpetuity.

by the legal acknowledgment of her title, Mary
would be more at liberty to pursue her dangerous
designs, and to ad without fear or reserve. Her
partisans were already meditating scheme for

arms; and notwithstanding Elizabeth's just title
to the affections of her fubjeds, might have
flaken and endangered her throne.

While this matter remained in suspense in both Mar en.
houses an account of it was transmitted to Mary improv"e th

advocates for her right, even among those who
were near Elizabeth's person, she endeavoured to
cultivate the disposition which appeared towards
fettling the right of succession in her favor, by a
letter to the Privy Counsellors of England. She ex'
pretled in it a grateful sense of Elizabeth's friendship,
which Ihe ascribes chiefly to their good offices with
their Sovereign in her behalf. She declared her
resolution to live in perpetual amity with England,
without urging or pursuing her claim upon the
Crown, any farther than should be agreeable to the
Queen. But, at the fame time, as her right of fuc-
ceflion was undoubted, Ihe hoped it would be exa-
mined with candor, and judged of with impartiality.

gave there letters the air of being nothing more
than a declaration of her own, and of her fubjedts
gratitude towards Elizabeth. But as the could not

Counsellors of another, could not be otherwise
contirued than as taken with an intention to
encourage the spirit which had already been raised
among the English. In this light it seems to have
appeared to Elizabetb berfelf ". But the difpo.
fition of her people rendering it necetfary to treat
IVlary's person with great decency, and her tide
with much regard, Ibe mentioned it to her only

eth .d tification to a Princess of Elizabeth's characer, than
r~iaet. the temper which both houses of Parliament dif.

covered on this occasion. She bent all her policy
to defeat or elude the motion. After allowing the
first heat of their zeal to evaporate, he :called into
her presence a certain number of each house. She
soothed and carefled them; she threatened and
promised; she remitted subsidies which were due;
and refused those which were offered; and in the
end prevailed to have this formidable motion put
off for that fefRion. Happily for her, the condud
of the Scottilb Queen, and the misfortunes which
besel her. prevented the revival of such a motion
in any future Parliament ".

to enter her dominions. Cardinal Laurea, at that
time Bilhop of Mondovi, was the person on whom
Pius V. conferred this office, and along with him
he sent the Queen a present of twenty thousand
crowns ". It is not the characer of the Papal court
to open its treasury. upon distant or imaginary
hopes. The business of the Nuncio in Scotland

But as the Earl of Bedford, and the Count de

Mary was obliged to suppress what passed in her

according to the rites of the Romish Church. But
neither Bedford, nor any of the Scottilh nobles

Nothing was now demanded of Mary, but to re-
nounce any title to the crown of England during
Elizabeth's life, and the lives of her posterity;
who, on the other hand, engaged to take no Rep
which might prove injurious to Mlary's claim upon
the fuccefion ".

Mary could, not, with decency, reject a pro.
position so equitable; she infifed, however, that
Elizabeth flould order the right upon which [he
claimed, to be legally examined, and publicly re-
cognised, and particularly that the testament of
HenryVIII. whereby he had excluded the descend-
ants of his eldelt filter the Queen of Scotland, from
the place due to them in the order of succession,
might be produced, and confidered by the Englifli
nobility. Mary's Ministers had credulously em.
braced an opinion, that this testament, which they
so jufly conceived to be injurious to their mistress,
was a mere forgery; and on different occasions
had urged Elizabeth to produce it. Mary would
have suffered considerably by gaining this point.
The original testament is Rill extant, and not the
leaR doubt can be entertained of its genuineness and
authenticity. But it was not Elizabeth's intention
to weaken or to set aside the title of the house of
Stewart. She aimed at nothing more, than to keep

M]orton and all the other conspirators against Ri.

Scotland. Mary, who had hitherto continued in.
exorable to every intreaty in their behalf, yielded
at last to the solicitations of Bothwell". He could
hope for no success in those bold designs on which
his ambition resolved to venture, without draw.
ing aid from every quarter. By procuring a favor
for Morton and his associates, of which they had
good reason to despair, he expeded to secure a
band of faithful and determined adherents.

The King still remained at Stirling, in solitude,

and under contempt. His.impatience in this fit.
ation, together with the alarm given him, by the
rumor of a design to seize his person, and confine
him to prison ", was the occasion of his leaving
that place in an abrupt manner, and retiring to
his father at Glasgow.

Nothing

Nothing less than a zeal, ready to endure and to B o K
susser every thing for a good cause, could have Iv.
persuaded men to adhere to a church, so indigent 566.
and so neglected. The extraordinary expenses,
occasioned by the Prince's baptism, had exhauRed
the Qneen's treasury, and the fums appropriated
for the filbfiftence of the clergy were diverted into
other channels. The Queen was therefore obliged
to prevent the just remonstrances of the assembly,
by falling on some new method for the relief of
the church. Some symptoms of liberality, some
firetch towards munificence, might have been
expected in an aflignment which was made with an
intention of soothing and silencing the clergy. But
both the Queen and the nobles held faR the riches
of the church which they had seized. A fum,
which, at the highest computation, can hardly be
reckoned equal to nine thousand pounds sterling",
was deemed sufficient for the maintenance of a'
whole national church, by men who had lately
seen single monasteries possessed of revenues far
superior in value.

The ecclesiastics in that age bore the grievances
which affeced themselves alone with astonishing
patience; but wherever the reformed religion was
threatened, they were extremely apt to be alarmed,
and to proclaim, in the loudest manner, their
apprehensions of danger. A just occasion of this
kind was given them, a short time before the meet-
ing of the assembly. The usurped and oppressive

pointed to hear and determine the causes which
formerly came under their cognizance ". Among
the few ads of that Parliament to which Mary had
paid any regard, this was one. She had confirmed
the. authority of the Commiffaries, and had given
them infiructions for directing their proceedings",
which are till of great authority, in that court.
From the time of their first appointment, these
judges had continued in the uninterrupted exercise
of their function, when of a sudden the Queen
issued a proclamation, restoring the Archbilhop of
St. Andrew's to his ancient jurifdidion, and depriv.
ing the Commiffaries of all authority ".

A motive, which cannot be justified, rendered

the Queen not unwilling to venture upon this rafb
adion. She had been contriving, for some time,
bow to re-establish die Popilh religion; and the
feftorjig the ancient ecclesiastics to their former
jurifdidion, seemed to be a considerable Rep towards
that end. The motive which prompted Bothwell,
to whole influence over the Queen this adion mu/t
be chiefly imputed", was fill more crimial. His
nterprifing ambition had already formed that bold
design, which he soon after put in execution; and
the use which we Ihall hereafter find him making
of that authority, which the Popifli ecclesiastic
regained, dikcovers the reasons of his present condud,

in contributing to revive their power. The Protest- B 0 O K
ant clergy were not unconcerned fpedators of an Iv.
event which threatened their religion with unavoid- "66
able deftrudion; but as they despaired of obtaining
the proper remedy from the Queen herself, they
addrefled a remonstrance to the whole body of the
Proteltant nobility, full of that ardent zeal for
religion, which the danger to which it was exposed
at that time, seemed to require ". What effects this
vehement exhortation might have produced, we
have no opportunity of judging, the attention of
the nation being quickly turned towards events
of another, and more tragical nature.

encroachments on her power, conspiracies against

were the injuries of which Mary had great reason
to complain. She felt them with the utmost fenfi-
bility; and added to the anguish of disappointed
love, they produced those symptoms of despair
which we have already described. Her resentment
against the King seems not to have abated from the
time of his leaving Stirling. In a letter written

tokens of sudden reconcilement appear. On the jan.ea

dud Two of her famous letters to Bothwell were
written during her flay at Glasgow, and fully lay
open this scene of iniquity. He had so far succeeded
in his ambitious and criminal dcfign, as to gain an
absolute ascendant over the Queen; and in a fitua.
tion such as Mary's, merit not so conspicuous,
services of far inferior importance, and addreft much
less insinuating than Bothwell's, may be supposed to
fecal imperceptibly on a female heart, and entirely
to overcome it. Unhappily, among those in the
higher ranks of life, scruples with regard to con
jugal fidelity are, often, neither many, nor strong
Nor did the manners of that court in which Maq
had been educated, contribute to increase or t
fortify them. The amorous turn of Francis I. an,
Henry II. the wildness of the military charade
in that age, and the liberty of appearing in all con
panies, which began to be allowed to women, wh
had not yet acquired that delicacy of sentiment, an

thole polifled manners, which alone can render BOOK
this liberty innocent, had introduced, among the Iv.
French, a licentiousness of morals that rofi to an ts«7.
aflonifling height. Such examples, which were
familiar to Mary from her infancy, could hardly
fail of diminifling that horror of vice which is
natural to a virtuous mind. The King's behaviour
would render the first approach of forbidden senti.
ments less /hocking; resentment, and disappointed
love, would be apt to represent whatever soothed
her revenge, as justifiable on that account; and so
many concurring causes might, almoRf impercepti-
bly, kindle a new paflion in her heart.

But whatever opinion we may form with regard The modvra
to the rife and progress of this paflion, the letters fit.
themselves breathe all the ardor and tenderness of
love. The affecion which Mary there expresses for
Bothwell, fully accounts for every subsequent part
of her conduct; which, without admitting this
circumstance, appears altogether mysterious, incon-
fiftent, and inexplicable. That reconcilement with
her hufand, of which , if we allow it to be
genuine, it is impollible to give any plausible
Iacount, is discovered, by the Queen's own con-
fcflion, to have been mere artifice and deceit. As
her averrion for her hulband, and the suspicious
attention with which she observed his condut,
became universally known, her ears were officiously
filled, as is usual in such cafes, with grbundlefs or
aggravated accounts of his adions. By some (he
was told, that the King intended to seize the
person of the Prince his son, and in his name to

E4

o0 K ulurp the government; by others she was assured,
IV. that he resolved infiantly to leave the kingdom;
ui7. that a veffcl was hired for this purpose, and lay in

the river Clyde ready to receive him". The last
was what Mary chiefly dreaded. Henry's retiring
into a foreign country mufl have been highly
dilbonorable to the Queen, and would have
entirely disconcerted Bothwell's measures. While
he resided at Glasgow, at a distance from her, and
in that part of the kingdom where the interest of
his family was greatet, he might, with more faci.
lity, accomplish his designs. In order, therefore, to
prevent his executing any such wild scheme, it
was necessary to bring him to some place where
he would be more immediately under her own

preaic an eye. For this purpose, The first employed all her
him to o' art to regain his confidence, and then proposed to

remove him to the neighbourhood of Edinburgh,
under pretence, that there he would have easier
accef< to the advice of physicians, and that The
herrelf could attend him without being absent from
her son ". The King was weak enough to fuffcr
himself to be persuaded; and being fill feeble,
and incapable of bearing fatigue, was carried in a
litter to Edinburgh.

The place prepared for his reception was a

house belonging to the Provost of a collegiate
church, called Kirk of Field. It Rood almof

a situation, on a rising ground, and at that time B 0 o K

ful air to recommend it; but, on the other hand, 116r.
the solitude of the place rendered it extremely
proper for the commission of that crime, with a
view to which, it seems manifefily to have been
chofcn.

Mary continued to attend the King with the e; inr.
moftafliduous care. She seldom was absent from him deced tlere
through the day; hbe slept two nights in the cham.

many marks of tenderness and confidence, as, in
a great measure, quieted those suspicions which
had so long disturbed him. But while he was fondly
indulging in dreams of the return of his former
happiness, he flood on the very brink of deftruc.
tion. On Sunday the ninth of February, about
eleven at night, the Queen left the Kirk of Field,
in order to be present at a malk in the palace.
At two next morning, the house in which the
King lay was blown up with gunpowder. The
noise and shock, which this sudden explosion oc-
cafioned, alarmed the whole city. The inhabitants
ran to the place whence it came. The dead body
of the King, with that of a servant who slept in
the fame room, were found lying in an adjacent
garden, without the city-wall, untouched by fire,
and with no bruise or mark of violence.

Such was the unhappy fate of Henry Stewart Hcislcu
Lold Darnly, in the twenty-firlf year of his age. t,.
The indulgence of fortune, and his owp external
accomplishments, without any other merit, had

BooK raised him to an height of dignity of which he

doated on him to diftradion. His insolence and
inconstancy alienated from him such of the nobles
as had contributed molt zealously towards his
elevation. His levity and caprice exposed him
to the scorn of the people, who once revered
him as the descendant of their ancient Kings and
heroes. Had he died a natural death, his end
would have been unlamented, and his memory
have been forgotten; but the cruel circumstances
of his murder, and the lhameful remissness
in negleding to avenge it, have made his name
to be remembered with' regret, and have rendered
him the object of pity, to' which he had other.

Two (lays after the murder, a proclamation was B o O K
issued by the Queen, offering a considerable reward iv.
to any person who flould discover those who z17.
had been guilty of fuich a horrid and detestable
crime "; and though Bothwell was now one of the
greatest fubjedcs in the kingdom , formidable on
account of his own power, and proteted by the
Queen's favor, it was impoflible to suppress the
sentiments and indignation of the people. Papers
were affixed to the most public places of the city,
accusing him of the murder, and naming his accom-
plices; pictures appeared to the fLme purpose, and
voices were heard in the middle of thle night, charg.
ing him with that barbarous action. But the authors
of these rumors did not confine their accusations
to Botlhwell alone; they insinuated that the Queen
lierfclf was accessary to the crime ". This bold ac-
cufation, which so direcly attacked Mary's re-
putation, drew the attention of her council; and
by engaging them in an inquiry after the authors
of these libels, diverted them from searching for
the murderers of the King ". It could scarce be
expeced that Mary herself would be extremely
solicitous to discover those who had rid her of a
hufland , whom flie had so violently hated. It was
Bothwell's interest, who had the supreme direc-
tion of this, as well as of all other affairs, to
flfle and suppress whatever evidence Ihould be
offtrcd, .nd to cover, if possible, the whole tranf-
acion under the veil of darkness and of silence.

upon that scene of guilt ".

It was not her own subjes alone who fufpeded

Mary of having been acceflary to this unnatural
crime; nor did an opinion, so diihonorable to her
character, owe its rife and progress to the jealousy
and malice of her faaious nobles. The report of
the manner and circumstances of the King's murder
spread quickly over all Europe, and, even in that
age, which was accustomed to deeds of violence,
it excited universal horror. As her unhappy breach
with her hulband had long been matter of public
discourse, the first conjecures which were formed
with regard to his death, were extremely to her
disadvantage. Her friends, at a loss what apology
to offer for her condu&t, called on her to prosecute
the murderers with the utmost diligence, and ex.
pected that the rigor of her proceedings would prove
the best and fullelt vindication of her innocence ".

He urged her to prosecute those who were guilty

he declared his own suspicion of Bothwell, and of
those who were named as his accomplices; he
required that, out of regard to decency, and in
order to encourage evidence to appear against
them, the persons accused of such an atrocious
crime fllould be committed to cuRody, or at leat
excluded from her court and presence"

Mary was then at Seaton, whither The had re-
tired after the burial of the King, whose body
was deposited among the Monarchs of Scotland,
in a private but decent manner '. The former
part of the Earl's demand could not, on any pre-
tence, be eluded; and it was resolved to bring
Bothwell immediately to trial. But, instead of
confining him to any prison, Mary admitted him ar,,,
into all her councils, and allowed a person, uni- tinuet to
verfally reputed the murderer of her hulband, to' aort hir.
enjoy all the security, the dignity, and the power
of a favorite '. The offices which Bothwell al-
ready possessed, gave him the command of all the
south of Scotland. The catle of Edinburgh,
however, was a place of so much consequence
that he wilhed earnestly to have it in his own
power. The Queen, in order to prevail on the
Earl of Mar to surrender it, consented to put Mar,.h

in her conduct, inconfifent with all the rules of
prudence and of decency, mutl be imputed to an
excess either of folly. or of love. Mary's known
charater fully vindicates her from the former;of
the latter, many and friking proofs soon appeared.

more than general suspicions, and -uncertain fur.

iifes, could be produced by his accusers. For

this reason, in a meeting of Privy Council held
on the twenty.eighth of March, the twelfth of
April was appointed for the day.of trial. Though
the law allowed, and the mariner in.which cri.
minal causes were carried on in that age required,
a much longer interval, it appears, from several
circumstances, that this Ihort space was ccl.
fiderably contrated, and that Lenox had onl'
eleven days warning to prepare for accusing a
person, so far superior to himfilf, both in power
and in favor ". No man could be less in a condition

land, it seems to have been considerably impaired
during his banilhment. His vassals, while he resided
in England, had been accustomed to some degree
of independence, and he had not recovered that
ascendant over them, which a feudal chief usually
polteffed. He had no reason to expect the concur-
rence of any of those factions into which the nobles
were divided. During the short period of his son's
prosperity, he had taken such steps as gave rife to
an open breach with Murray and all his adherents.
The partisans of the house of Hamilton were
his hereditary and mortal enemies. Huntly was
linked in the closest confederacy with Bothwell;
and thus, to the disgrace of the nation, Lenox
stood alone in a cause, where both honor 'and

this gave him warning some days sooner, that Ihe intended
to bring on the trial without delay. But the precise time
could not be legally or certainly known to Lenox sooner
than ten or twelve days before the day on which he was
required to appear. By the law and pratice of Scotland, at
that time, parties were summoned, incases of treaon,

to punilh hiln. Besides a numerous body of his.
friends and vassals assembled, according to cuf-
tom, from different parts of the kingdom, he
was attended by a band of hired soldiers, who

Boo0 marched with flying colors along the streets of

I. Edinburgh ''. A court of justice was held with
I*67. the accustomed formalities. An indidment was

presented against Bothwell, and Lenox was
called upon to make good his accuL£tion. In his
name appeared Robert Cunningham, one of his
dependants. He excused his Malter's absence,
on account of the shortness of the time, which
prevented his al'embling his friends and vassals,
without whose afiflance he could not, with
safety , venture to set himself in opposition to
such a powerful antagonist. For this reason, he
desired the court to flop proceeding, and pro.
tested, that any sentence which sbould be pased
at that time, ought to be deemed illegal and void.
Bothwell, on the other hand, inifted that the
court should instantly proceed to trial. One of Le-
nox's own letters, in which he craved of the Queen
to prosecute the murderers without delay, was pro.
duced. Cunningham's objedions were over.ruled;
and the jury, confiting of Peers and Barons of the
first rank, found Bothwell not guilty of the crime.

iBonhwen i No person appeared as an accuser, not a single
cqittttL witness was examined, nor any evidence prodos

ced against him. The jury, under these circum
Rances, could do nothing else but acquit him.
Their verdict, however, was far from gratifying
the withes, or fikncing the murmurs of the
people. Every circumstance in the trial gave
grounds for suspicion, and excited indignation;
and the judgment pronounced, instead of being a

proof of Bothwell's innocence, was efleemed an Bo0 o
argument of his guilt. Pasquinades and libels were Iv.
affixed to different places, expressing the sentiments is'r.
of the public with the utmost virulence of language.

The jury themselves seem to have been aware
of the censure to which their proceedings would
be exposed; and, at the fame time that they
returned their verdict acquitting Bothwell, the
Earl of Caithness protested, in their name, that
no crime should be imputed to them on that ac-
count, because no accuser had appeared, and no
proof was brought of the indictment. He took
notice, likewise, that the ninth instead of the
tenth of February was mentioned in the indic-
ment, as the day on which the murder had been
committed: A circumflance which discovers the
extreme inaccuracy of those who prepared the
indiCtment; and at a time when men were difpo.
fed, and not without reason, to be suspicious of
every thing, this small matter contributed to con.
firm and to increase their fufpicians ''.

Even Bothwell himself did not rely on the judge.
ment which he had obtained in his favor, as a full
vindication of his innocence. Immediately after his
acquittal, he, in compliance with a custom which
was not then obsolete, publilhed a writing, in which
he offered to fight, in single combat, any Gentleman
of good fame, who should presume to accuse him
of being accessary to the murder of the King.

engagements to that purpose, and, in confe.
quence of these, had ventured upon some steps
more public and vigorous than any she 'had for-
merly taken. But though none of these cir-
cumRtances were unknown to Bothwell, there
were powerful motives which prompted him, at
this juncture, to conciliate the good-will of the
ProteRants, by exerting himself in order to pro-
cure for them some additional security in the
exercise of their religion. That which they en-
joyed at present, was very precarious, being
founded entirely on the royal proclamation if-
sued loon after the arrival of the Queen in Scot-
land, which, in express terms, was declared to
be only a temporary regulation. From that
period, neither the solicitations of the General
Assemblies of the Church, nor the intreaties of
her people, could extort from Mary any concef-

their sacred rights by no better tenure than a

the clergy and with the people , as might indut

for pointing out (Remarks on the History of Scotland , ch. 9.) mn l

neither ellabliflied the Reformed-religion as the religion of
the fRate, nor abolished Popery, yet it granted such new and
legal security to the Proteflants, as was deemed, in that age,
an acquisition of great value. The framers of the law seem
ma'iifecly to have viewed it in that light; after reciting " that

were absolutely devoted to the Queen, and ready
to tooth all her paflions, instantly declared their
fatisfadion with what he had proposed. The reft,

had acquired, and observed the Queen's growing
afiflion towards him in all her acions, were wil.

they could neither oppofe-nor defeat. Some few
were confounded and enraged. But, in the end,
Bothwell, partly by promises and flattery, partly
by terror and force, prevailed on all who were
present to subscribe a paper, which leaves a deeper
slain than any occurrence in that age, on the honor
and character of the nation.

of Bothwell's innocence, and the most ample

if she Ihould condescend to beRow on him that
mark of her regard, they undertook to promote

for the Protefant faith '. No common interest can
be supposed to have united men of such opposite

fatal to her peace. This strange coalition was the

with a tender hand, seeming desirous that it should

as so many persons, who, both at that time, and

this paper, the [fupicion becomes strong, that Both-

to Mary., nor disapproved by her ".

"' Of all the different fyfemn with regard to this tran facion,

that of Camden seems to be the least accdrate, and the wort

the fame time, that the subscriptions to thIs paper were ob-

the absurdity of fuppoling that any man's enemies would
contribute towards railing him to such high dignity, on the

regard "'.

Three days after the rising of Parliament, Mary Botwell
went from Edinburgh to Stirling, in order to visit 'raies the
the Prince her son. Bothwell had now brought his force to
schemes to full maturity, and every precaution being Dulb"r.
taken which could render it safe to enter on the last
and decisive ftep, the natural impetuosity of his
spirit did not susser him to deliberate any longer.
Under pretence of an expedition againt the freeboot-
ers on the borders, he assembled his followers; and
marching out of Edinburgh with a thousand horse,
turned suddenly towards Linlithgow, met the Aril e4.
Queen on her return near that place, dispersed her
fender train without refitance, seized on her person,
and conduced her, together with a few of her cour.
tiers, as a prisoner to his castle of Dunbar. She ex-
pressed neither surprise, nor terror, nor indignation,
at such an outrage committed on her person, and

himself, x57. Melvil's remonstrance must have happened
some time before the meeting of Parliament; for after of.
fending Bothwell, he retired from :ourt; he allowed his rage
time to subside, and had again joined the Queen, when she
was seized, April 24. 1s8. The time which must have
elapsed, by this account of the matter, was perhaps sufficient
to have gained Herries from being an opposer to become a
promoter of the marriage. Perhaps Melvil may have com-
mitted some mistake with regard to this sac, so far as relates
toLord Herries. He could not well be n~faken iwith regard
to what himself did.

in Mary's name, the scheme had been communi.
cated to her, and every fep towards it was taken
with her participation and advice "'.

Both the Queen and Bothwell thought it of

advantage to employ this appearance of violence.
It afforded her a decent excuse for her condud;
and while Ihe could plead that it was owing toforte
rather than choice, she hoped that her reputation,
among foreigners at least, would escape without
censure, or be exposed to less reproach Bothwell
could not help distrusting all the methods which
had hitherto been used, for vindicating him from
any concern in the murder of the King. Something
was Rill wanting for his security, and for quieting
his guilty fears. This was a pardon under the
Great Seal. By the laws of Scotland, the mos
heinous crime muff be mentioned by name in a
pardon, and then all lelfer offences are deemed to

Bothwell, having now got the Queen's person B o K
into his hands, it would have been unbecoming Iv.
either a politician or a man of gallantry to have 157.
delayed consummating his schemes. The first ftep fro, vli
towards this was to have his marriage with Lady own wife
Jane Gordon, the Earl of Huntly's siser, dissolved.
In order to accomplilb that, in a manner confiRent
with the ideas of the Queen on one hand, and
with the sentiments of his countrymen on the other,
two different processes became necessary. One
founded on the maxims of the Canon law, the
other accommodated to. the tenets of the Reformed
Church. Bothwell, accordingly, commenced a suit,
in his own name, in the spiritual court of the Arch.
bihop of St. Andrew's, the jurisdiCtion of which
the (ueen had restored, by a special commission
granted for this purpofc, and pleaded, that Lady April a

"' In her own time, it was urged as an aggravation of the

Queen's guilt, that she gave her consent to marry the huC.
band of another woman; and the charge has been often re.
peated since. But, according to lary's own ideas, confo.
nant to the principles of her religion, the marriage of Both-
well with Lady Jane Gordon was unlawful and void, and she
confidered them as living together not in the hallowed bonds
of matrimony, but in a tate of criminal intercourse. Both.
well's addresses, which fruck her Protestant subje&s, not
only as indecent but flagitious, could not appear in the fame
light to her; and this may be pleaded in extenuation of the

o0OK Lady Jane to apply to the Protetlant court of
Iv. Commiffaries for a divorce, on account of his
ss6. having been guilty of adultery. The influence

of Bothwell was of equal weight in both courts.
In the course of four days, with the fame indecent
and suspicious precipitancy, the one declared the
marri;ge to be illegal and null, the other pro.
nounced a sentence of divorce ".

The fidelity and loyalty of that nobleman were
too well known to expeCt that he would be willing
to put the Prince into the hands of the man who
wa\ so violently fufpeded of having murdered his

1i67. of his days, and in his capital city; the person

fu(pe&ed of that odious crime suffered not only
to appear publicly in every place, but admitted
into the presence of the Queen, diftinguilhed by
her favor, and intruRed with the chief diredion of
her affairs; fubjeCed to a trial which was carried
on with most flamelefs partiality, and acquitted
by a sentence, which served only to confirm the
suspicions of his guilt; divorced from his wife,
on pretences frivolous, or indecent; and after all
this, instead of meeting with the ignominy due
to his actions, or the punilbment merited by his
crimes, permitted openly, and without opposition,
to marry a Queen, the wife of the Prince whom
he had affaflinated, and the guardian of those laws
which he had been guilty of violating. Such a
quick fucceflion of incidents, so singular and lo
detelable, in the space of three months, is not to
be found in any other history. They left, in the
opinion of foreigners, a mark of infamy on the
charadter of the nation. The Scots were held in
abhorrence all over Europe; they durst hardly
appear any where in public; and after suffering
so many atrocious deeds to pass with impunity,
they were univerfaily reproached as men void of
courage, or of humanity, as equally regardlefi of
the reputation of their Queen, and the honor of
their country "'.

These reproaches roused the nobles, who had B o o K
been hitherto amused by Bothwell's artifices, or Iv.
intimidated by his power. The manner in which 'i67.

his repeated attempts to become maler of the againif her

ings against him, which he let fall "', added to the,
violence and promptitude of their resolutions. A
conliderable body of them assembled at Stirling,
and entered into an association for the defence of
the Prince's person. Argyll, Athol, Mar, Morton,
Glencairn, Home, Lindsay, Boyd, Murray of
Tullibardin, Kirkaldy of Grange, and Maitland the
Secretary, were the heads of this confederacy"'.
Stewart Earl of Athol was remarkable for an
uniform and bigotted attachment to popery; but
his indignation on account of the murder of the
King, to whom he was nearly allied, and his
zeal for the safety of the Prince, overcame, on
this occasion, all considerations of religion, and
united him with the molt zealous Protestants.
Several of the other nobles aced, without question,
from a laudable concern for the safety of the
Prince, and the honor of their country. But the
spirit which some of them discovered during the
subsequent revolutions, leaves little room to doubt,
that ambition or resentment were the real motives
of their condud; and that, on many occasions,
while they were pursuing ends just and necessary,
they were aduated by principles and passions alto.

1s67. no frangers to the sentiments of the nation, with

refpec to their conduet; and though their marriage

that it had not been carried on without the secret

take arms. All Bothwell's past crimes were enume-
rated , all his wicked intentions displayed and
aggravated, and every true Scotsman was called
upon to join them in avenging the one, and in
preventing the other"'.

Meanwhile, Bothwell assembled his forces at

corner, he soon gathered such strength, that he
ventured to advance towards the confederates.

and secrecy of their enterprise gave their friends

the other hand, Bothwell durst not rilk a delay "'.
His army followed him with reluctance in this
quarrel, and served him with no cordial affecion;
so that his only hope of success was in surprising
the enemy, or in flriking the blow before his own
troops had leisure to recollect themselves, or to
imbibe the fame unfavorable opinion of his acions,
which had spread over the reft of the nation.
There motives determined the Queen to, march
forward, with an inconsiderate and fatal speed.
Tne o~t On the first intelligence of her approach, the

·

aig.r i confederates advanced to meet her. They found
t her forces drawn up almost on the fame ground

which the English had occupied before the battle
of Pinkie. The numbers on both fides were nearly
equal; but there was no equality in point of
discipline. The Queen's army confided chiefly of
a multitude, hastily assembled, without courage or
experience in war. The troops of the confederates
were composed of Gentlemen of rank and reputa.
tion, followed by their most trusty dependants,
who were no less brave than zealous t'.

uodation the field, labored, by negociating both with the
Wt'tPi. Queen and the nobles, to put an end to the quarrel

without the effusion of blood. He represented t(

against the Queen, but against the murderer of
her huflbnd; and if he were given up to jultice,
or banished from her presence, {he should find
them ready to yield the obedience which is due
from fubjedts to their Sovereign. Glencairn added,
that they did not come to ask pardon for any
offence, but to punish those who had offended.
Such haughty answers convinced the ambassador,
that his mediation would be ineffectual, and that
their paflions were too high to allow them to liften
to any pacific propositions, or to think of retreat-
ing after having proceeded so far".

The Queen's army was poRfed to advantage,
on a rising ground. The confederates advanced
to the attack resolutely, but slowly, and with the
caution which was natural on that unhappy field.
Her troops were alarmed at their approach , and
discovered no inclination to fight. Mary endea-
voured to animate them; she wept, The threat-
ened, The reproached them with cowardice, but
all in vain. A few of Bothwell's immediate at-
tendants were eager for the encounter; the reft
flood wavering and irresolute, and some began to
fleal out of the field, Bothwell attempted to in-

B 0 K V.

THE confederate Lords had proceeded to such B 0 o 1
extremities againlt their Sovereign, that it now v.
became almost impdffible for them either to flop iss6.
flort, or to pursue a course less violent. Many Deliberations
of the nobles had refused to concur with them in concerning
their enterprise; others openly condemned it. A the 2Oeeo.
fmiall circumRtance might abate that indignation
with which the multitude were, at present, ani-
mated against the Queen, and deprive them of
that popular applause which was the chief founda-
tion of their power. These considerations inclined
some of them to treat the Queen with great
lenity.

But, on the other hand, Mary's affeaion for
Bothwell continued as violent as ever; she obfti.
nately refused to hearken to any proposal for dif-
solving their marriage, and determined not to

B 0 0 K abandon a man, for whose love she had already

v. sacrificed so much '. If they should allow her to
iss:. recover the supreme power, the first exertion of it

would be to recal Bothwell; and they had reason,
both from his resentment, from her condud, and
from their own, to expec the feveref effecrs of
her vengeance. These considerations surmounted
every other motive; and reckoning themselves
absolved, by Mary's incurable attachment to Both.
well, from the engagements which they had comae
under when she yielded herself a prisoner, they,
without regarding the duty which they owed her
as their Queen, and without consulting the ref
of the nobles, carried her next evening, under a

Tey is. strong guard, to the castle of Lochlevin, and

of it, to detain her as a prisoner. This castle is

nels. Several fufpeded persons were seized. Cap-
tain Blackadder and three others were condemned
and executed. But no discovery of importance
was made. If we believe some historians, they
were convicted by sufficient evidence. If we give
credit to others, their sentence was unjust, and
they denied, with their last breath, any knowledge
of the crime for which they suffered '.

An unexpected accident, however, put into the
hands of Mary's enemies what they deemed the
fuller evidence of her guilt. Bothwell having left
in the castle of Edinburgh a cakret, containing
several sonnets and letters written with the Queen's
own hand; he now sent one of his confidents to
bring to him this' precious depofite. But as his
melfenger returned, he was intercepted, and the
caflkt seized by Morton 4. The contents of it were
always produced by the party, as the molf ample
juilfiication of their own conduct, and to these
they continually appealed as the moR urfanfwerable
proof of their not having loaded their Sovereign
with the imputation of imaginary crimes '.

without great offence. Notwithstanding the po, v.

very exalted. The confederates had, in her opi.
nion, encroached on the authority of their Sove.
reign. which they had no right to control, and
had offered violence to her person, which it was
their duty to esteem sacred. They had ect a dan.
gerouc example to other fubjeats, and Mary's cause
became the common cause of Princes '. If ever
Elizabeth was influenced with regard to the afairs
of Scotland by the feelings of her heart, rather
than by considerations of intereR, it was on this
occasion. Mary, in her present condition, de-
graded from her throne, and covered with the
infamy attending an accusation of such atrocious
crimes, could be, no longer, the object of Eliza-
beth's jealousy, either as a woman, or as a Queen.
Sympathy with a Sovereign in distress seems, for
a moment, to have touched a heart not very sus-
ceptible of tender sentiments; and, while these
were yet warm, she dispatched Throkmorton into Jun 3,
Scotland, with power to negociate both with the
Queen and with the confederates. In his in. '
ftrutions there appears a remarkable solicitude
for Mary's liberty, and even for her reputation;
and the terms upon which (he proposed to re-
eftablilh concord between the Queen and her
fubjeds, appear to be so reasonable and well di.
gested, as might have ensured the safety and hap.

00o pines of both. Zealous as Throkmorton was to
V. accomplish this, all his endeavours and addres
11s7. proved ineffeaual. He found not only the con.

federate nobles, but the nation in general, so far
alienated from the Queen, and so much offended
with the indecent precipitancy of her marriage
with the reputed murderer of her former hufhaid,
as to be incapable of listening to any proposition
in her favor.

During the fate of anarchy, occasioned by the

imprisonment of the Queen, and the dissolution
of the established government, which afforded
such ample scope for political speculation, four
different schemes had been proposed for the set.
dement of the nation. One, that Mary ihould
be replaced upon the throne, but under vaios
and ftrid limitations. The second, that lK
Ihould resign the crown to her son, and retiring
out of the kingdom, should reside, during the re
mainder of her days, either in England or in
France. The third, that Mary should be brought
to public trial for her crimes, and after con
vidion, of which no doubt was entertained,
mhould be kept in perpetual imprisonment. TI
fourth, that after trial and condemnation, capia
punifiment should be inflicted upon her. Throk
morton, though disposed as well by his own in
clination, as in conformity to the spirit of hi
inftrutions, to view matters in the light 0mo
favorable to Mary, informed his Court, that thi
milder schemes, recommended by Maitland alone
would undoubtedly be reprobated, and one of th
more rigorous carried into execution.

In juRification of this rigor, the confederates BooK
maintained that Mary's affetion for Bothwell v.
was still uri.bated, and openly avowed by her; zs6r.
that Ihe rejefed with disdain every proposal for
dissolving their marriage; and declared , that ihe
would forego every comfort, and endure any ex-
tremity, rather than give her consent to that mea-
sure. While these were her sentiments, they con-
tended, that concern for the public welfare, as
well as attention to their own safety, rendered it
necessary to put it out of the Queen's power to
restore a daring man, exasperated by recent inju-
ries, to his former Ration, which mull needs
prove fatal to both. Notwithstanding their soli.
citude to conciliate the good-will of Elizabeth,
they foresaw clearly what would be the effeft, at
this juncure, of Trokmorton's interposition in
behalf of the Queen, and that The, elated with
the profped of protection, would refuse to liftea
to the overtures which they were about to make
to her. For this reason they peremptorily de-
nied Throkmorton access to their prisoner; and
what propositions he made to them in her behalf
they either refused or eluded '.

Meanwhile they deliberated with the utmoRt somt of
anxiety, concerning the settlement of the nation, the onfe.
and the future disposal of the Queen's person. der", o.
Elizabeth, ohferving that Trokmorton made no
progress in his negociations with them, and that
they would liften to none of his demands in Mary's
favor, turned towards that party of the nobles

tempt to the utmost of her power `. But they
discovered no greater union and vigor than for.
merly, and, behaving like men who had given up
all concern either for their Queen or their coun,
try, tamely allowed an inconsiderable part of
their body, whether we confider it with rerped to
ndmbers or to power, to fettle the government
of the kingdom, and to dispose of the Queen's
person at plafure. Many consultations were held,
and various opinions arose with regard to eac of
these. Some seemed desirous of adhering to the
plan on which the confederacy was at first formed;
and after punilhing the murderers of the King,
and diflolving the marriage with Bothwell; after
providing for the safety of the young Prince, and
the security of the Protestant religion; they pro.
posed to re-eftablilh the Queen in the poflflion
of her legal authority. The success with which
their arms had been accompanied, inspired othes
with bolder and more desperate thoughts, and no.
thing less would satisfy them than the trial, the
condemnation, and punilhment of the Queen her-
self, as the principal conspirator against the life of
her hulband, and the safety of her son ": the for.
mer was Maitland's system , and breathed too
much of a pacific and moderate spirit , to be
agreeable to the temper or wilbes of the party.

Both parties agreed at last upon a scheme, They olig
neither so moderate as the one, nor so daring as the Queen
the other. Mary was to be persuaded or forced to tO', regn th
resign the Crown; the young Prince was to be
proclaimed King, and the, Earl of Murray was
to be appointed to govern, the kingdom, during
his minority, with the name and authority of
Regent. With regard to the Queen's own per-
son, nothing was determined. It seems to have
been the intention of the confederates to keep
her in perpetual imprisonment; but in order to
intimidate herself, and to overawe her partisans,
they Rill reserved to themselves the power of pro.
ceeding to more violent extremes.

It was obvious to foresee difficulties in the exe-
cution of this plan. Mary was young, ambitious,
high.fpirited, and accustomed to command. To
induce her to acknowledge her own incapacity for
governing, to renounce the dignity and power
which Die was born to enjoy, to become depend.
ant to her own fubjeas, to consent to her own
bondage, and to invest those persons whom the
confidered as the authors of all her calamities
with that honor and authority of which lhe her-
self was stripped, were points hard to be gained.

" The intention of putting the Queen to death seems to
have been carried on by some of her subje&s: at this time we

a woman to hearken almost to any overtures. The

uaerbi.gs During this rapid progress of the confederates,

wibh aftoniihment; and various and contradidor
opinions were formed concerning the extraordi

vorers of the Queen, and notwithstanding the
exorbitant privileges of the nobles, the Prince
poIfefles confiderble power, and his person is
treated with great veneration. No encroachments
should be made on the former, and no injury
offered to the latter, but in cafes where the li-
berty and happiness of the nation cannot b, fe.
cured by any other means. Such cafes seldom
exist, and it belongs not to any part, but to the
whole, or at lear to a majority of the society, to
judge of their existence. By what action could
it be pretended that Mlairy had invaded the rights
or property of her fubjtcas, or what scheme had
the formed against the liberty and constitution of
the kingdom ? Were fears, and suspicions, and
furmif s, enough to just y the imprisoning and
the deposing a Qt;cen, to whom the Crown de-
fended flom so long a race of Monarchs ? The
principal author of whatever was reckoned cul-

pable in her condut, was now driven from her BOOK
prcferce. The murderers of the King might have v.
been brought to condign punishment, the safety 's.
of the Prince have been secured, and the ProtefRant
religion have been eltablifhed, without wrefling
the ceptre out of her hands, or condemning her
to perpetual imprisonment. Whatever right a free
Parliament might have had to proceed to such a
rigorous conclusion, or whatever name its deter-
minations might have merited, a sentence of this
nature, passed by a (mall part of the nobility,
without acknowledging or consulting the reft of
the nation, must be deemed a rebellion against the
government, and a conspiracy against the person of
their Sovereign.

The partisans of the confederates reasoned very
differently. It is evident,. said they, that Mary
either previously gave consent to the King's mur-
der, or did afterwards approve of that horrid
a&fio. Her attachment to Bothwell, the powers
and honors with which fie loaded him, the man.
ner in which The suffered his trial to be carried on,
and the indecent speed with which iTe married a
man, fained with so many crimes, raise firong sus-
picions of the former, and put the latter beyond
all doubt. To have suffered the supreme powerto
continue in the hands of an ambitious man, capable
of the molt atrocious and desperate actions, would
have been disgraceful to the nation; dishonorable
to the Queen, and dangerous to the Prince. Re-
courfc was, therefore, had to arms. The Queen
had been compelled to abandon a hulband, so un-

o o worthy of herself. But her affetion toward hi
v. still continuing unabated; her indignation againi
sr7. the authors of this separation being visible, and

often expressed in the ftrongelt terms; they, by
restoring her to her ancient authority, would have
armed her with power to destroy themlfves, have
enabled her to recal Bothwell, and have afforded
her an opportunity of pursuing schemes fatal to
the nation with greater eagerness, and with moe
success. Nothing, therefore, remained, but.by one
bold adion to deliver themselves and their coun
try from all future fears. The expedient they had
chosen was no less refpedful to the royal blood,
than necefary for the public safety. While one
Prince was set aside as incapable Aof governing,
the Crown was placed on his head who was the
undoubted representative of their ancient Kins.

Whatever opinion poterity may form on com.

paring the arguments of the two contending partie,
whatever sentiments we may entertain concern.
ing the jufice or necefity of that course which
the confederates held, it cannot be denied that
their conduct, so far as regarded themselves, was
extremely prudent Other expedients, less rigorous
towards Mary, might have been found for fettliu
the nation; but, after the injuries which theybad
already afforded the Queen, there was nonie
effedual for securing their own safety, or perp
tuating their own power.

were still assembled at Hamilton, and seemed to ISt'
be entering into sone combination against his go.
vernment, an association for supporting it was
formed, and signed by so many persons of power
and influence throughout the nation, as entirely
discouraged the attempt ".

The return of the Earl of Murray, about this Murny ar..
time, added Rrength to the party, and gave it a oumetht
regular and finished form. Soon after the murder
of the King, this nobleman had retired into France,
upon what pretence historians do not mention.
During his residence there, he had held a close
correspondence with the chiefs of the confederacy,
and, at their desire, he now returned. He seemed,
at firt, unwilling to accept the office of Regent.
This hesitation cannot be ascribed to the scruples
either of diffidence or of duty. Murray wanted
neither the abilities nor the ambition which enti-
tled him to aspire to this high dignity. He had
received the sirs accounts of his promotion with
the utmost fatisfadtion; but by appearing to continue
for some days in suspense, he gained time to view
with attention the ground on which he was to ac;
to balance the strength and resources of the two
contending facions, and to examine whether the
foundation on which his future fame and success
must reft, were found and firm.

Before he declared his final resolution, he
waited on Mary at Lochlevin. This visit, to a

o o sifter, and a Queen, in a prison, from which he
v. bad neither any intention to relieve her, nor to
1567 mnitigate the rigor of her confinement, may be

mentioned among the circumstances which dit
cover the great want of delicacy and refinemnt
in that age. Murray, who was naturally rough
and uncourtly in his manner ", expofRulated so
warmly with the Queen concerning her paR coon
dud, and charged her faults so home upon her,
that Mary, who had flattered herself with more
gentle and brotherly treatment from him, melted
into tears, and abandoned herself entirely to de.
fpair ". This interview, from which Murray ould
reap no political advantage, and wherein he di
covered a spirit so severe and unrelenting, may be
reckoned among the most bitter circumfance& ig
Mary's life, and is certainly one of the most n.
justifiable fieps in his condu&

it impoffibe for him to make bead, in that country,
against his enemies, or even to secure himfelffroa
their pursuit, he fled for lhelter to his kinsman the
Blhop of Murray; and when he, overawed by the

retired to the Orkney Illes. Hunted from place to v.
place, deserted by his friends, and accompanied 157.
by a few retainers, as desperate as himself, he
fuffcred at once the miseries of infamy and of
want. His indigence forced him upon a course which
added to his infamy. He armed a few small hlips,
which had accompanied him from Dunbar, and
attacking every vessel which fell in his way, en-
deavoured to procure subsistence for himself and
his followers by piracy. Kirkaldy and Murray of
Tullibardin were lent out against him by the con-
federates; and surprising him while he rode at
anchor, scattered his small fleet, took a part of it,
and obliged him to fly with a single ship towards
Norway. On that coast, he fell in with a vessel
richly laden, and immediately attacked it; the
Norwegians failed with armed boats to its aflift.
ance, and after a desperate fight, Bothwell and
al his crew were taken prisoners. His name and
quality were both unknown, and he was treated
at first with all the indignity and rigor which the
odious crime of piracy merited. His real charater
was soon discovered, and though it saved him
from the infamous death to which his associates
were condemned, it could neither procure him
liberty, nor mitigate the hardships of his imprison.
ment. He languilhed ten years in this unhappy
condition; melancholy and despair deprived him
of reason, and at laR he ended his days, unpitied
by his countrymen, and unafifted by trangers ".

sot his abilities and popularity, than the nobles
of whom it was composed, loft all hopes of gin

the Regent. So many of them were brought t

appearance of opposition to the eftablilbed govern
ment was left in the kingdom. Had they adhered
to the Queen with any firrtnefs, it is probable,
from Elizabeth's disposition at that time, that It
would have afforded them such aflifance as migh
have enabled them to face their enemies in the
field. But there appeared so little vigor or har
mony in their councils, that Ihe was discouraged
from espousing their cause; and the Regent,
taking advantage of their situation, obliged then
to submit to his government, without grantin

any terms, either to themselves or to the Book

The Regent was no lets successful in his attempt Is7r.

behind her, and then threw the keys into the lake.
lMary ran with precipitation to the boat which
was prepared for her, and on reaching the ihore,
was received with the utmost joy, by Douglas,
Lord Seaton, and Sir James Hamilton, who, with
a few attendants , waited for her. She inftanly
mounted on horseback, and rode full speed towards
Niddrie, Lord Seaton's feat in Weft-Lothian. She

On the first news of Mary's escape, her friends, Arrves at

few days, her court was filled with a great and "mt.

numbers of followers, as formed an army above
ftx thousand frong. In their presence Ihe de.
dared that the resignation of the Crown and the
I oter deeds which Ihe had. igned during het itti
prilonmeiat, were extorted from her by fear, Sir
Robert Mlldvil confirmed her declaration; and
on that, as well as on other accounts, a council
of the nobles and chief men of her party pros

tions, and so fatal to their schemes, gave a grel

wavering and irresolute ; others began to cany

a junture, where his own fame, and the being

of zeal; succours might arrive from other parts lss.
of the kingdom in a few days; in war, success
depends upon reputation, as much as upon
numbers; reputation is gained or loft by the
first fep one takes; in his circumstances, a re-
treat would be attended with all the ignominy of
a flight, and would at once dispirit his friends,
and inspire his enemies with boldness. In such His lrudeat
dangerous exigencies as this, the superiority of i"nt.
Murray's genius appeared, and enabled him both
to chufe with wisdom and to ad with vigor.
He declared against retreating, and fixed his
head.quarters at Glasgow. And while he amused
the Queen for some days, by pretending to hearken
to some overtures, which lhe. made for accom-
modating their differences, be was employed, with
the utmost industry, in'drawing together his ad-
herents from different parts of the kingdom. He
was soon in a condition to take the field; and
though far inferior to the enemy in number, he
confided so much in the valor of his troops and the
experience of his officers, that he broke off the
ncgociation, and determined to hazard a battle".

At the fame time, the Queen's generals had MaT Is.
commanded her army to move. Their intention
was, to conduct her to Dunbarton-caftle, a place
of great strength, which the Regent had not been
able to wrest out of the hands of Lord Fleming

o o1 the governor; but if the enemy Ihould endeavour
v. to interrupt their march, they resolved not to
msq. decline an engagement. In Mary's situation, no

resolution could be more imprudent. A part
only of her forces was assembled. Huntly, Ogil.
vie, and the northern clans were soon expected;
her sufferings had removed or diminished the
prejudices of many among her fubjedts; the
address with which fle surmounted the danger
that obfruded her escape, dazzled and interested
the people; the sudden confluence of so many
nobles added lufire to her cause; hIe might as.
furedly depend on the friendfbip and countenance
of France; Ihe had reason to expect the protedfion
of England; her enemies could not poflihly look
for support from that quarter. She had much to
hope from pursuing flow and cautious measures;
they had every thing to fear.

Bat Mary, whose hopes were naturally fan.

guine, and her passions impetuous, was so elevated
-by her sudden transition from the depth of distress,
to such an unusual appearance of prosperity, that
.he never doubted of success. Her army, which
was almoR double to the enemy in number, con-
fiRed chiefly of the Hamiltons and their de.
pendants. Of these the Archbiflop of St. An.
drew's had the chief diredion, and hoped, by a
vitory, not only to crulh Murray, the ancient
enemy of his house, but to get the person of the
Queen into his hands, and to oblige her either to
marry one of the Duke's sons, or at leat to com-
mit the chief direction of her affairs to himfelt

the battle. Between the two armies, and on the
road towards Dunbarton, there was an eminence
called Langfide Hill. This the Regent had the
precaution to seize, and porled his troops in a small
village, and among some gardens and inclofures
adjacent. In this advantageous situation be waited
the approach of the enemy, whose superiority in
cavalry could be of no benefit to them on such
broken ground. The Hamiltons, who composed
the vanguard, ran so eagerly to the attack, that
they put themselves out of breath, and left the
main battle far behind. The encounter of the spear-
men was fierce and desperate; but as the forces of
the Hamiltons were exposed, on the one flank, to a
continued fire from a body of mufqueteers, attacked
on the other by the Regent's most choice troops,
and not supported by the reft of the Queen's army, The Queen'
they were soon obliged to give ground, and the featd.t
rout immediately became universal. Few vidories,
in a civil war, and among a fierce people, have
been pursued with less violence, or attended with
less bloodshed. Three hundred fell in the field:
In the flight almost none were killed. The Regent
and his principal officers rode about, beseeching
the soldiers to spare their countrymen. The
number of prisoners was great, and among them

B o o X many persons of diftinaion. The Regent marched

v. back to Glasgow, and returned public thanks
t1s. to God for this great, and, on his fide, almoR

bloodless victory '"
HifehL During the engagement, Mary flood on a bill,

at no great distance, and beheld all that palsed in
the field, with such emotions of mind as are not
easily defcnbed. When The saw the army, which
was her last hope, thrown into irretrievable con.
fusion, her spirit, which all her pall misfor.
tunes had not been able entirely to subdue, funk
altogether. In the utmoR consternation, she be.
gan her flight, and so lively were her impreffons
of fear, that fbe never closed her eyes till dhe
reached the. abbey of Dundrenan in Galloway, full
sixty Scottish miles from the place of battle ".

These revolutions in Mary's fortune had been

no lcfs rapid 'than singular. In the short space of
eleven days, bie had been a prisoner at the mercy
of her mos inveterate enemies; she had seen a
powerful army under her command, and a nu.
merous train of nobles at her devotion: And now
Ihe was obliged to fly, in the utmost danger of her
life, and to lurk, with a few attendants, in a corner
of her kingdom. Not thinking herself safe, even
in that retreat; her fears impelled her to an action,
the most unadvised, as well as the moR unfortunate
in her whole life. This was her retiring into Eng.
land, a ftep, which, on many accounts, ought to
have appeared to her ralh and dangerous.

' Keith, 477. " Id. 4 1.

Before Mary's arrival in Scotland, mutual BOOK

diflruft and jealoufie. had arisen between her and v.
Elizabeth. All their subsequent tranfaaions had "'g.
contributed to exasperate and inflame these pas- ., 'r,,gino
sions. She had endeavoured, by secret negociations England.
and intrigues, to dilturb the tranquillity of Eliza-
beth's government, and to advance her own pre.
tenlions to the English Crown. Elizabeth, who
pofteffed great power, and acted with left reserve,
had openly supported Mary's rebellious fubledts,
and fomented all the dissensions and troubles in
which her reign had been involved. The maxims
of policy still authorised that Queen to pursue the
fame course; as by keeping Scotland in confusion,
(he effecually secured the peace of her own king-
dom. The Regent, after his victory, had marched
to Edinburgh, and not knowing what course the
Queen had taken, it was several days before he
thought of pursuing her ". She might have been
concealed in that retired corner, among fubjeds
devoted to her interest, until her party, which was
dispersed rather than broken by the late defeat,
fliould gather such strength that she could again
appear with fafsty at their head. There was not
any danger, which The ought not to have run,
rather than throw herself into the hands of an
enemy, from whom ITe had already suffered so
many injuries, and who was prompted, both by
inclination and by interest, to renew them.

But, on the other hand, during Mary's

confinement, Elizabeth had declared against the
"Crawf Me. .9.

B o o x proceedings of her fubjeds, and solicited for bet

v. liberty, with a warmth which had all the appearance

* of sincerity. She had invited her to take refuge in

England, and had promised to meet her in person,
and to give her such a reception as was due to a
Queen and an ally ". Whatever apprehension
Elizabeth might entertain of Mary's designs while
tbe had power in her hands, the was, at present,
the obje, not of fear, but of pity; and to take
advantage of her situation, would be both ungener.
ous and inhuman. The horrors of a prison were
frelh in Mary's memory, and if she Ihould fall a
second time into the hands of her fubjets, there
was no injury to which the presumption of success
might not embolden them to proceed. To attempt
escaping into France, was dangerous; and, in her
situation, almost impossible; nor could the bear the
thoughts of appearing as an exile and a fugitive
in that kingdom where the had once enjoyed all
the splendor of a Queen. England remained her
only asylum; and, in spite of the intreaties of Lord

ner~tiou Herries, Fleming, and her other attendants, who
m criik. conjured her, even on their knees, not to confide

in Elizabeth's promises or generosity, her infatua.
tion was invincible, and the resolved to fly thither.
Herries, by her command, wrote to Lowther the
deputy-gove nor of Carlisle, to know what recep.
tion he would give her; and, before his answer
could return, her fear and impatience were so great,
wi r' that Ihe got into a filter.boat, and with about twenty

attendants, landed at Wirkington in Cumberland, o o
and thence Ihe was conduced with many marks v.
of refped to Carlile ". I s6

As soon as Mary arrived in England, she wrote Elizibetl,
a long letter to the Queen, representing, in the dliberatc
firongeft terms, the injuries which Ihe had suffered themanner
from her own fubjeds, and imploring that pity and of treatin
afliflance which her present situation demanded r.
An event so extraordinary, and the conduct which
might be proper in consequence of it, drew the
attention, and employed the thoughts, of Elizabeth
and her council. If their deliberations had been
influenced by considerations of jutlice or generosity
alone, they would not have found them long or
intricate. A Queen, vanquilhed by her own sub-
jeas, and threatened by them with the loss of her
liberty, or of her life, had fled from their violence,
and thrown herself into the arms of her nearest
neighbour and ally, from whom ihe had received
repeated assurances of friendship and proteaion.
These circumstances entitled her to refpeat and to
compaflion, and required that Ihe Lhould either be
restored to her own kingdom, or at lealt be left at
full liberty to seek aid from any other quarter. But
with Elizabeth and her counsellors, the question
was not, what was most jull or generous, but what
was molf beneficial to herself, and to the Englilh
nation. Three different resolutions might have been
taken, with regard to the Queen of Scots. To re.
inRate her in her throne, was one; to allow her to
" Keith, 48j. Aoderf. o iv. a. " Id. 29.

o oK retire into France, was another; to detain her in
'. England, was a third. Each of these drew confe
'*$s quences after it, of the utmost importance, which

were examined, as appears from papers fill ex.
tant", with that minute accuracy which Eliza
beth's Ministers employed in all their consultations
upon affairs of moment.

To restore Mary to the full exercise of the royal

authority in Scotland, they observed, would render
her more powerful than ever. The nobles who
were most firmly attached to the English interef
would quickly feel the utmost weight of her relent.
ment. As the gratitude of Princes is seldom frong
or lasting, regard to her own interest might soon
efface the memory of her obligations to Elizabeth,
and prompt her to renew the alliance of the Scpttilh
nation with France, and revive her own preten.
sions to the Englilb Crown. Nor was it poflible to
fetter and circumscribe the Scottish Queen, by any
conditions that would prevent these dangers. Her
party in Scotland was numerous and powerful Her
return, even without any support from England,
would inspire her friends with new zeal and courage;
a single vicory might give them the fuperrioty,
which they had loft by a single defeat, and render
Mary a more formidable rival than ever to Eliza
beth.

The dangers arising from suffering Mary to return

into France, were no less obvious. The French
King could not refuse his afliftance towards restoring

' AnderC voL iv. 34. 99. o02.

his fifler and ally to her throne. Elizabeth would, B o OK
once more, fee a foreign army in the island, over. v.
awing the Scots, and ready to enter her kingdom; are.
and if the commotions in France, on account of
religion, were fettled, the Princes of Lorrain
might resume their ambitious projets, and the
united forces of France and Scotland might invade
England, where it is weakest and molt defenceless.

Nothing therefore remained but to detain her Rertbln t
in England; and to permit her either to live at dtin her
liberty there, or to confine her in a prison. The
former was a dangerous experiment. Her court
would become a place of resort to all the Roman
Catholics, to the diaffgeed, and to the lovers of
innovation. Though Elizabeth asseted to repre.
feat Mary's pretensions to the English Crown as
altogether extravagant and ill-founded, The was
not ignorant that they did not appear in that
light to the nation, and that many thought them
preferable even to her own title. If the activity of
her emissaries had gained her so many abettors,
her own personal influence was much more to be
dreaded; her beauty, her address, her sufferings,
by the admiration and pity which they would
excite, could not fail of making many converts
to her party".

It was indeed to be apprehended, that the treating
Mary as a prisoner would excite universal indigna-
tion against Elizabeth, and that by this unexampled
severity towards a Queen, who implored, and to

V. forfeit the praise of justice and humanity, which
Iss. was hitherto due to her administration. But the

Englilh Monarchs were often so solicitous to secure
their kingdom against the Scots, as to be little
scrupulous about the means which they employed
for that purpose. Henry IV. had seized the heir of
the Crown of Scotland, who was forced, by the
violence of a storm, to take refuge in one of the
ports of his kingdom; and, in contempt of the
rights of hospitality, without regarding his tender
age, or the tears and intreaties of his father,
detained him a prisoner for many years. This
icion, though detested by posterity, Elizabeth
resolved now to imitate. Her virtue was not more
proof than that of Henry had been, against the
'temptations of interest; and the possession of a
present advantage was preferred to the profped of
future fame. The fatisfadion which ihe felt in
mortifying a rival, whose beauty and accomplilh-
ments Ihe envied, had,' perhaps, do less influence
than political considerations, in bringing her to
this resolution. But, at the fame time, in order to
screen herself from the censure which this condud
merited, and to make her treatment of the Scottibi
Queen look like the effect of necessity, rather than
of choice, The determined to affume'the appear-
ance of concern for her interest, and of deep fympa.
thy with her sufferings.
Ma, o. With this view, [he instantly ;dispatched Lord

Scroope warden of the weft marches, and Sir
Francts Knollys her viccchanabedaio, to the Queen

of Scots, with letters full of expressions of kindness B o o i
and condolence. But, at the fame time, they had v.
private inftrutions to watch all her motions, and 1568.
to take care that the should not escape into her own
kingdom " On their arrival, Mary demanded a Mary i,.
perlonal interview with the Queen, that Ihe might nnldadnltb
lay before her the injuries which fie had suffered, Eibi,",bh°'
and receive from her those friendly offices which /he preence.
had been encouraged to expect. They answered,
that it was with reluca'nce admilifon into the pre.
fece of their Sovereign was at present denied her';
that while Ihe lay under the imputation of a crime
so horrid as the murder of her hulband, their mistress,
to whom he was so nearly allied, could nor, with.
out bringing a stain upon her own reputation, admit
her into her pretence; but as loon as she had
cleared herself from that aspersion, they promised
her a reception suitable to her dignity, and aid
proportioned to her diRrefs ".

Nothing could be more artful than this pretence; She offr, t,
and it was the occasion of leading the Queen of vn',te her
Scots into the snare in which Elizabeth and her
Mlinifters wished to entangle her. Mary expressed
the utmoRt surprise at this unexpected manner of
evading her request; but as Ihe could not believe
so many profeflions of friendship to be void of
sincerity, Ihe frankly offered to submit her cause
to the cognizance of Elizabeth, and undertook to
produce such proofs of her own innocence, and
of the falthood of the accusations brought against
" Anders. vol. iv, 36. 70 . 9a. ' Ibid. vol. iv. 8. s$.

B o ox her, as {hould fully remove the scruples, and satisfy

v. the delicacy of the Englifl Queen. This was the
int6 very point to which Elizabeth labored to bring

tki, aJai. the matter. In consequence of this appeal of the
oge tiis Scottiff Queen, {he now confidered herself as the

umpire between her and her fubjeds, and forcaw
that (he would have it entirely in her own power
to protrad the inquiry to any length, and to
perplex and involve it in endless difficulties. In the
mean time, The was furnished with a plausible reason
for keeping her at a distance from court, and for
refuGng to contribute towards replacing her on
the throne. As Mary's conduct had been extremely
incautious, and the presumptions of her guilt were
many and firong, it was not impofible her sub.
je&s might make good their charge against her;
.and if this mhould be the result of the inquiry,
1he would, thenceforth, cease to be the objed
of regard or of companion, and the treating her
with coldness and negled would merit little cen.
hue. In a matter so dark and mysterious, there
was no probability that Mary could bring proofs
of her innocence, so incontefted, as to render
the condud of the Englilh Queen altogether
culpable; and, perhaps, impatience under rctiat,
suspicion of Elizabeth's partiality, or the difcovety
of her artifices, might engage, Mary in fuhb
cabals, as would justify the using her with greater
rigor.

Elizabeth early perceived many advantages

which would arise from an inquiry into the con-
duct of the Scottih Queen, carried on under her

direfion.

direc'ion. There was some danger, however, that 0o O
Mlary might discover her secret intentions too V.
soon, and by receding from the offer which The a"6
had mJde, endeavour to disappoint them. But
even in that event, Ihe determined not to drop
the inquiry, and had thought of several different
expedients for carrying it on. The Countess of
Lenox , convinced that Mary was accessary to
the murder of her son, and thirfling for that venge-
ance which it was natural for a mother to de-
mand, had implored Elizabeth's justice, and soli.
cited her, with many tears, in her own name,
and in her hulband's, to bring the Scottish Queen
to a trial for that crime ". The parents of the
unhappy Prince had a just right to prefer this
accusation; nor could The, who was their nearef
kinswoman, be condemned for listening to so
equitable a demand. B.fides , as the Scottilh
nobles openly accused IMiary of the fame crime,
and pretended to be able to confirm their charge
by sufficient proof, it would be no difficult matter
to prevail on them to petition the Queen of Eng-
land to take cognizance of their proceedings
against their Sovereign; and it was the opinion
of the Englih council, that it would be reason-
able to comply with the request ". At the fame
time, the obsolete claim of the superiority of
England over Scotland began to be talked of;
and, on that account, it was pretended that the
decision of the contest between Mary and her
fubjecs belonged of right to Elizabeth ". But

"Camd. 4 2. Haynes,469. " And. vol. i. part . .37. "Ibid.
VOL. 11. K

B0 o though Elizabeth revolved all there expedients in

v. her mind, and kept them in reserve to be made ue
n<I. of as occasion might require, The wished that the

inquiry into Mary's conduft Ihould appear to be
undertaken purely in compliance with her own de.
mand, and in order to vindicate her innocence; and
so long as that appearance could be preserved, none
of the other expedients were to be employed

When Mary consented to submit her cause to

Elizabeth, Ihe was far from fufpedling that any bad
consequences could follow, or that any dangerous
pretensions could be founded on her offer. She
cxpeRed that Elizabeth herself would receive and
examine her defences "; fle meant to confider her
as an equal, for whose fatisfadion The was willing
to explain any part of her conduat that was liable
to censure, not to acknowledge her as a superior,
before whom the was bound to plead her cause.
But Elizabeth put a very different sense on Mary's
offer. She confidered herself as chosen to be judge
in the controversy between the Scottifl Queen and
her fubjets, and began to aa in that capacity
She proposed to appoint commiflioners to hear tbh
pleadings of both parties, and wrote to the Re
gent of Scotland to impower proper persons t(
appear before them, in his name, and to produo
what he could alledge in vindication of his pro
ceedings againlt his Sovereign.

Mrieatll Mary had, hitherto, relied with unaccountabl

woadct. cxpe'ted that so many kind speeches would, i

last, be accompanied with some suitable ations. B o Oa
But this proposal entirely undeceived her. She v.
plainly perceived the artifice of Elizabeth's con. -aw'
dud, and saw what a diminution it would be to
her own honor, to appear on a level with her re-
bellious fubjedts, and to stand together with them
at the bar of a superior and a' judge. She re.
traded the offer which she had made, and which
had been perverted to a purpose so contrary to her
intention. She demanded, with more earnelcnefs
than ever, to be admitted into Elizabeth's pre.
fence; and wrote to her in a strain very different
from what The had formerly used, and which JUI"' 1
fully discovers the grief and indignation that
preyed on her heart. " In my present situation,"
fays hce, " I neither will nor can reply to the
a accusations of my fubjees. I am ready, of my

trial, acknowledge them to be so. I fled into

the intreaties and remonRrances of the Scottilh
Queen, to go on with the inquiry into her con.

that Elizabeth could not, confifently with her

persons of some diflindion, who had been taken
prisoners in the battle, were tried and condemned
to death, as rebels against the King's government.
They were led to the place of execution, .but by
the powerful interceflion of Knox they obtained
a pardon. Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh was one
of the number, who lived to give both the Regent
and Knox reason to repent of this commendable
ad of lenity ".

Soon after, the Regent marched with an army,
consisting of four thousand horse and one thousand
foot, towards the weR borders. The nobles in
this part. of the kingdom were all the Queen's
adherents; but as they had not force sufficient to
obftrud his progress, he must either have obliged
them to submit to the King, or would have laid
waRe their lands with fire and sword. But Eli-
zabeth, whose interest it was to keep Scotland in
confusion, by preserving the balance between the
two parties, and who was endeavouring to sooth
the Scottiil Queen by gentle treatment, inter-
posed at her desire. After keeping the field two
weeks, the Regent, in compliance to the Engliih

more difficult, and any profpedc of making her
escape was entirely cut off. She now felt herfell
to be entirely in Elizabeth's power, and though
treated as yet with the respeCt due to a Queen,
her real condition was that of a prisoner. Mary
knew what it was to be deprived of liberty, and
dreaded it as the worst of all evils. While the
remembrance of her late imprisonment was fill
lively, and the terror of a new one filled her
mind, Elizabeth thought it a proper juncture to
renew her former proposition, that she would fug
ser the Regent and his adherents to be called into
England, and consent to their being heard in de.
fence of their own conduct She declared it to
be far from her intention to claim any right ol

degrading her so far as to require that the Ibouki

selves from those crimes with which (he hai

that it is impossible to believe her sincere in this
part of her conduc; nor can any thing mark
more firongly the wretchedness of her condition,

Queen's adherents were alarmed, and Argyll and
Huntly, whom Mary had appointed her lieutenants

of Scotland, began to assemble forces to obftrud
this meeting. Compassion for the Queen, and envy

that the Regent consented to this measure. His

foreign jurifdition, was extremely mortifying. To
accuse his Sovereign before frangers, the ancient
enemies of the Scottilh name, was an odious tal.
To fail in this accusation was dangerous; to fuc-
ceed in it was disgraceful. But the strength of the
adverse faction daily increased. He dreaded the in-

before whom they were to appear, the high rank The Co,-
of the persons whose cause was to be heard, and otk.
the importance of the points in dispute, rendered
the whole tranfadion no less illustrious than it
was singular. The situation in which Elizabeth
appeared, on this occasion, trikes us with an air
of magnificence. Her rival, an independent Queen,
and the heir of an ancient race of Monarchs, was
a prisoner in her hands, and appeared, by her
Ambafladors, before her tribunal. The Regent of
Scotland, who represented the majesty, and pofl
sessed the authority of a King, stood in person at
her bar. And the fate of a kingdom, whose power
her ancestors had often dreaded, but could never
subdue, was now at her disposal.

The views, however, with which the several vin of
parties consented to this Conference, and the issue ther4i"
to which they expected to bring it, were extremely
different.

Mary's chief obje& was the recovering her

former authority. This induced her to consent to
a measure against which she had long struggled.
Elizabeth's promises gave her ground for enter-
taining hopes of being restored to her kingdom;
in order to which, The would have willingly
made many coaceffions to the King's party; and
the influence of the Englilh Queen, as well as
her own impatience under her present fiwadton,

i 0 K might have led her to many more ". The Re.

v. gent aimed at nothing but securing Elizabeth's
I1ó3 protection to his party, and seems not to have

had the molt distant thoughts of coming to any
composition with Mary. Elizabeth's views were
more various, and her schemes more intricate. She
seemed to be full of concern for Mary's honor,
and solicitous that The Ihould wipe off the aspersions
which blemified her charater. This she pretended
to be the intention of the Conference; amusing
Mary, and eluding the solicitations of the French
and Spanilh Ambassadors in her behalf, by repeated
promises of aflifting her, as soon as Ihe could ven.
ture to do so, without bringing disgrace upon her.
self. But, under this veil of friendlbip and gene.
rofity, Elizabeth concealed sentiments of a different
nature. She expeded that the Regent would accuse
Mary of being accessary to the murder of her
hulband. She encouraged him, as far as decency
would permit, to take this desperate fRep ". And
as this accusation might terminate in two different
ways, The had concerted measures for her future

burden her own conscience with the guilt of an
action so detestable as the restoring her to her
kingdom . If it flould happen, that what her

after dependant not only upon England, but upon
her own fubjeds *'. As every ftep in the progrets
of the Conference, as well as the final result of
it, was in Elizabeth's own power, she would fill
be at liberty to chufe which of these courses Ihe
would hold; or if there appeared to be any danger
or inconveniency in pursuing either of them, she
might protract the whole cause by endless delays,
and involve it in inextricable perplexity.

The Conference, however, was opened with comPlgat
much solemnity. But the very first ftep disco. Queen's
vered it to be Elizabeth's intention to inflame, commiflmo
rather than to extinguish the dissensions and ani. ,h,',-tt
mofities among the Scots. No endeavours were
used to reconcile the contending parties, or to
mollify the fierceneTs of their hatred, by bringing
the Queen to offer pardon for what was past, or
her fubjets to promise more dutiful obedience
for the future. On the contrary, Mary's corn- o.oobr.
miflioners were permitted to prefer a complaint
against the Regent and his party, containing an
enumeration of their treasonable ations, of their
sizing her person by force of arms, committing
her to prison, compelling her to resign the
Crown, and making use of her son's name to co-
lor their usurpation of the whole royal authority;
"AnderC voL iv. part ii. 16.

BooK and of all these enormities they required such

v. speedy and cffedual redress, as the injuries of one
*ssa Queen demanded from the justice of another ".

It was then expected that the Regent would

have disclosed all the circumstances of that un.
natural crime to which he pretended the Queen
had been accessary, and would have produced
evidence in support of his charge. But far from
accusing Mary, the Regent did not even answer
the complaints brought against himself. He disco.
vered a relutance at undertaking that office, and
started many doubts and scruples, with regard to
which he demanded to be resolved by Elizabeth
herself ". His reserve and hesitation were no less
surprising to the greater part of the English comn
mifioners than to his own associates. They knew
that he could not vindicate his own conduc
without charging the murder upon the Queen,
and he had not hitherto flown any extraordinary
delicacy on that bead. An intrigue, however,
had been secretly carried on, since his arrival at
York, which explains this mystery.

they were bound, in good policy, as well as in
duty, to conceal and to cover. It was easy for
lMaitland, whose sentiments were the fame with
the Duke's, to vindicate his own conduct. He as.
fured him, that he had employed all his credit to
dissuade his countrymen from this measure; and
would till contribute, to the utmoftof his power,

to communicate the matter to the Regent. He
repeated and enforced the fame arguments which
be had used with Maitland. He warned him of
the danger to which he must expose himself by
such a violent adion as the public accusation of
his Sovereign. Mary would never forgive a man,
who had endeavoured to fix such a brand of infamy
on her characer. If Ihe ever recovered any degree
of power, his deftrudion would be inevitable,

which they contained, made a deep impreflion on
the Regent. He daily received the firongeR affur.

if he abstained from accusing her of such an odious
crime, together with the denunciations of her ir.

these demands was signed by himself alone,

he demanded. It became necessary to transmit the
articles to herself, and by the light in which Norfolk

While the Englilb commiflioners waited for

fuller inftrudions with regard to the, Regent's
demands, he gave in an answer to the complaint
which had been offered in name of the Scottilb
Queen. It was expressed in terms perfedly con.
formable to the system which he had at that time
adopted. It contained no insinuation of the Queen's
being accessory to the murder of her hulband; the
bitterness of style peculiar to the age was confider.
ably abated; and though he pleaded, that the
infamy of the marriage with Bothwell, made it
necessary to take arms in order to dissolve it;
though Mary's attachment to a man so odious
justified the keeping her for some time under
restraint; yet nothing more was laid on these fab.

The conference had, hitherto, been conducted B o'o X
in a manner which disappointed Elizabeth's views, v.
and produced none of these difcoveries'which ile ss.
had expected. The distance between York and enceremotei

for her sagacity in penetrating the designs of
her enemies, and feeing through their deepest
schemes ". Instead, therefore; of returning any

remove the conference to Westminster, and to
appoint new commissioners, in whom (he could

We often find Mary boasting of the superiority in

the conference at York, and how, by the strength
of their reasons, they confounded her adversaries,
and silenced all their cavils". The dispute Rsod,
at that time, on a footing which rendered her
victory not only apparent, but easy. Her participa.

circumstance upon which her fubjets ought to

sing this capital argument.

Elizabeth resolved that Mary Ihould not enjoy

the fame advanage in the conference to be held
at Westminster. She deliberated with the utmost
anxiety, how fle might overcome the Regent's
fcuples, and persuade him to accuse the QUeCo.
She confidered of the most proper method for
bringing Mary's commifioners.to answer such an
accusation; and as Ihe foresaw that the promises
with which it was necelfary to allure the Regent,
and which it was impofible to conceal from the
Scottith Queen, would naturally exasperate her to
a great degree, Ihe determined to guard her more
parrowly than ever; and though Lord Scroop had
given her no reason to distrust his vigilance or
fidelity, yet because he was the Duke of Norfolk's
brother-in-law, she thought it proper to remove
the Queen as soon as possible to Tuthbury in
$taffordlhire, and commit her to the keeping of
the Earl of Shrewlbury, to whom that catle
belonged "

circumflance extremely mortifyirig. The Regent
having arrived at London, in order to be present
at the conference, was immediately admitted into
Elizabeth's presence, and received by her, not only
with refpe, but with affedion. This Mary justly
confidered as an open declaration of that Queen's

if that were denied, Ihe initruded them to declare,

to the conference at Westminster, and protested,
that whatever was done there, should be held to
be null and invalid".

This, perhaps, was the most prudent resolution
]lary could have taken. The pretences on which

v. junlure for offering them well chosen. But either
*s dthe Queen's letter did not reach her commiffllone

.in due time, or they suffered themselves to be
deceived by Elizabeth's, profeflions of regard for
their Milfrefs, and consented to.the opening of
the conference ".
Sw. ss. To the commissioners who had appeared in-her

name at York, Elizabeth now added Sir Nichola
Bacon, Keeper of the Great Seal,. the Earls of
Arundel and Leicester, Lord-Clinton, and Sir
William Cecil ". The difficulties which obtruded
the proceedings at York were quickly removed. A
latisfying answer was given to the Regent's de.
mands; nor was be so much ,disposed to hefitatc,
and raise objetions, as formerly. His negociation
with Norfolk had been discovered to Morton by
fame of Mary's attendants, and he had commuoi.
cated it to Cecil". His personal safety, .as well as
the continuance of his power, depended on Eliza
beth. By favoring Mary, hfe might at any time
ruin him, and by a question which the artfully
started, concerning the person who had a right, by
the law of Scotland, to govern the kingdom dyring
, a minority, the let him fee, that even without
restoring the Queen, it was an easy matter for
her to deprive him of the supreme diretion of
affairs ". These considerations, which were power.

Sovereign to the eyes of firangers; but. that now
the insolence and importunity of the adverse faRion
forced them to publilh, what they had hitherto,
though with loss to themselves, endeavoured to
conceal". These pretexts are decent.; and the
considerations, which be mentions, had, during
some time, a real influence upon the conduct of
the party; but since the meeting of Parliament
held in December, they.had discovered so little
delicacy and reserve with refpetl to the Queen's
adions, as renders it impossible to give credit to
those studied professions. The Regent and his
afllociates were drawn, it is plain, partly by the
necellity of their affairs, and partly.by Elizabeth's
artifices, into a situation where no liberty of choice
was left to them; and they were obliged either to
acknowledge themselves to be guilty of rebellion,
or to charge Mary with having been accessory to
the commission of murder.

The accusation itself was conceived in the

firongeft terms. Mary was charged, not only with

these crimes mould be denied, an offer was made
to produce the most ample and undoubted evidence

Earl of Lenox appeared before them; and after
bewailing the tragical and unnatural murder of
his son, be implored Elizabeth's justice against the
Queen of Scots, whom he accused, upon oath,
of being the author of that crime, and produced
papers, which, as he pretended, would make good
what be alledged. The entrance of a new ador

her, againf all the future proceedings of the commis-
fioners ". A protestation of this nature, offered just
at the critical time when such a bold accusation had
been preferred against Mary, and when the proofs
in support of it were ready to be examined, gave
reason to fufpet that /he dreaded the event of that
examination. This suspicion received the strongest
confirmation from another circumstance; Ross and
Herries, before they were introduced to Elizabeth,
in order to make this protestation, privately ac-
quainted Leicester and Cecil, that as their Miftrels
had, from the beginning, discovered an inclination
towards bringing the differences between herself and
her fubjefts to an amicable accommodation, so Ihe '
was fill desirous, notwithstanding the Regent's
audacious accusation, that they 1hould be terminated
in that manner ".

Such moderation seems hardly to be compatible
with the strong resentment which calumniated
innocence naturally feels; or with that eagerness
to vindicate itself, which it always discovers. In
alary's situation, an offer so ill-timed mult be con.
fidered as a confeflion of the weakness of her cause.
The known character of her commiflioners exempts
them from the imputation of folly, or the suspicion

her a pretence for rejeding it. She reprefentedto
·Mary's commissioners, that, in the present junc-
ture, nothing could be so dilbonorable to their
Mistress, as an accommodation; and that the matter
would seem to be huddled up in this manner,
merely to suppress discoveries, and to hide her
ibame; nor was it poflible that she could be ad.
nitted, with any decency, into her presence, while
fie lay under the infamy of such a public accusation.

Upon this repulfc, Mary's commissioners with'

drew; and as they had declined answering, there
seemed now to be no further reason for the Regent's
producing the proofs in support of his charge. But
without getting there into her hands, Elizabeth's
schemes were incomplete; and her artifice for this
purpose was as mean, but as successful, as any Ihe
had hitherto employed. She commanded her coa.
miflioners to testify her indignation and displeasure
at the Regent's presumption, in forgetting so far the
duty of a subjed, as to accuse his Sovereign of such
.atrocious crimes. He, in order to regain the good
opinion offuch a powerful protetrefs, offered to (how
that his. accusations were not malicious, nor ill-

the Regent's authority, and of the Queen's refigna. .-s.
tion; the confessions of the persons executed for
the King's murder; and the fatal calket which
contained the letters, sonnets, and contracts, that
have been already mentioned.

that they might have an opportunity of confidering
the mode in which an inquiry of such public im.

the amount of the evidence now brought against a
person who claimed a preferable right of fucceflion
to the Engli(h crown. In this refpetable assembly
all the proceedings in the conferences at York and
WVefminfer were reviewed, and the evidence pro.
duced by the Regent of Scotland against his Sove.
reign was examined with attention. In particular,
the letters and other papers laid to be written by
the Queen of Scots, were carefully compared " for
the manner of writing and orthography," with a
variety of letters which Elizabeth had received at
different times from the Scottish Queen; and, as
the result of a most accurate colledion, the members
of the Privy Council, and .noblemen conjoined
with them, declared that no difference between
these could be discovered ". Elizabeth, having

V.. began to lay aside the expreffiens of friendihip and

refrpeC which hIe had hitherto used in all her letten
to the Scottish Queen. She now wrote to her in fedi
terms, as if the presumptions of her guilt had
amounted to certainty; the blamed her for refuting
to vindicate herself from an accusation which could
not be left unanswered, without a manifest injury
to her cbaracter; and plainly intimated, that rilets
that were done, no change would be made in her
present situation ". She hoped that fich a discovery
of her sentiments would intimidate Mary, who was
hardly recovered from the hfock of the Regents
attack on her reputation, and force her to confini
her resignation of the Crown, to ratify Murray's
authority as Regent, and to consent that both bet.
self and her fonl fould reside in England, under
Englifl proteaion. This scheme Elizabeth had
much at heart; the proposed it both to Mary and to
her commiflioners, and neglected no argument, nor
artifice, that could poflibly recommend it. Mary
saw how fatal this would prove to her reputation,
to her pretensions, and even to her personal safety.
She rejected it without befitation. " Death, said Lhe,

the Crown of Scotland; and, at the fame time, the
question with regard to the English fuccelIion was
to be decided in favor of the Earl of Hartford, who
had promised to marry one of Cecil's daughters. An
account of these wild and chimerical projects was
spread indultrioufy among the Scots. Elizabeth,
perceiving it was calculated of purpose to bring her
government into difreputation, labored to destroy
its effects, by a counter-proclamation, and became
more disgusted than ever with the Scottish Queen ".

The Regent, on his return, found the kingdom Ebrk of

They were encouraged, too, by the appearance
of a leader, whose high quality and pretensions
entitled him to great authority in the nation.
This was the Duke of Chatelherault, who had
resided for some years in France, and was now
sent over by that court, with a small supply of
money, in hopes that the presence of the first no

Queens party. Elizabeth had detained him in

Argyl arid Huntly refuted to be included in this 1x6,.
treity. A secret negociation was carrying on in
Engl.an, in favor of the captive Queen, witi so
much success, that her affairs began to wear a better
aspec, and her return into her own kingdom seemed
to be an event not very distant. The French King
had lately obtained such advantages over the uin
gonots, that the extincion of that party appeared
to be inevitable, and France, by recovering do.
medic tranquillity, would be no longer prevented
from proteting her friends in Britain. These .sir
cumflances not only influenced Argyll and Huntly,
but made so deep an impreflionon the Duke, that
he appeared to be wavering and irresolute., and
plainly discovered that he wilhed to evade. the na.
complinfinent of the treaty. The Regent saw the
danger of allowing the Duke to Ihake himfelfloofe,
in this manner, from his engagements; and instantly
formed a resolution equally bold and politic... He
commanded his guards to seize Chatelherault in:his
own house in Edinburgh, whither he had come
in order to attend the Convention agreed upon;
and, regardless either of his dignity as the first
nobleman in the kingdom, and next heir to the
Crown, or of the promises of personal security, on

to conclude a marriage with the Duke of Norfolk.

tociation in England, which we have already men-
tioned. The fertile and projeting genius of
i\laitland firfl conceived this scheme. During
the Conference at York , he communicated it to
the Duke himself, and to the Rilhop of Ross.
The former readily closed with a scheme so flat-
tering to his ambition. The latter confidered it
as a probable device for restoring his Miflrefs to
lliberty, and replacing her on her throne. Nor

promise, that (he should attempt nothing, in con.

to her own throne, but in securing to her that of

all there proposals, except the second, with regard
to which (he demanded some time for confuking

'he whole of this negociation was industriously

expeced that fie would willingly come into a

But, in a matter of so much consequence to the v.
nation, the taking a few steps without her know- S6s
ledge could hardly be reckoned criminal; and while
eery person concerned, even Mary and Norfolk
tlhemfelves, declared that nothing flould be con-
cluded without obtaining her consent, the duty
and allegiance of fubjedts seemed to be fully. pre.
served. The greater part of the nobles regarded the
matter in this light. Those who conducted the
intrigue, had farther and more dangerous views.
They saw the advantages which Mary would
obtain by this treaty, to be present and certain; and
the execution of the promises which The came under,
to be difiant and uncertain. T'hey had early com-
municated their scheme to the Kings of France and
Spain, and obtained their approbation '. A treaty
concerning which they consulted foreign Princes,
while they concealed it from their own Sovereign,
could not be deemed innocent. They hoped,
however, that the union of such a number of the
chief persons in the kingdom would render it
necessary for Elizabeth to comply; they flattered
themselves that a combination so firong would
be altogether irresistible; and such was their
confidence of success, that when a plan was con-
certed in the North of England for rescuing
PNary out of the hands of her keepers, Norfolk,
who was afraid that if she recovered her liberty,
her sentiments in his favor might change, used

Is9. In this situation did the affair remain, when Lord

Boyd arrived from England; and, besides the
letters which he produced publicly, brought others
in cyphers from Norfolk and Trokmorton to the
Regent, and to Maitland. These were full of the
molt sanguine hopes. All the nobles of England
concurred, laid they, in favoring the design. Every
preliminary was adjusted; nor was it possible that
a scheme so deep laid, conducted with so much
art, and supported both by power and by numbers,
could miscarry, or be defeated in the execution.
Nothing now was wanting, but the concluding
ceremony. It depended on the Regent to haften
that, by procuring a sentence of divorce, which
would remove the only obstacle that flood in the
way. This was expeced of his promise to Nor.
folk; and if he regarded either his interest or his
fame, or even his safety, he would not fail to
fulfil these engagements '.

But the Regent was now in very different cir.

cumftances from those which had formerly in.
duced him to asset an approbation of Norfolk's
schemes. He saw that the downfal of his own
power muff be the first consequence of the Duke's
success; and if the Queen, who confidered him
as the chief author of all her misfortunes, Ihould
recover her ancient authority, he could never

cafioned a delay. But, as every other circumstance
was fettled, the Bilhop of Ross, in name of his
lMinrefs, and the Duke, in person, declared, in
pretence of the French Ambassador, their mutual
consent to the marriage, and a contrac to this

it could not long remain a secret. It began to be dircovert the
wliifpered at court; and Elizabeth calling the Dke's de.
Duke into her presence , expressed the utmost sg,a
indignation at his condu&t, and charged him to lay
aside all thoughts of prosecuting such a dangerous
design. Soon after Leicefler, who perhaps had coun-
tenanced the projec with no other intention, revealed
all the circumstances of it to the Queen. Pembroke,
Arundel, Lumley, and Throkmorton, were confined
and examined. Mary was watched more narrowly
than ever; and Hastings Earl of Huntingdon, who
pretended to dispute with the Scottifl Queen her right
to the succession, being joined in commiflion with
Shrewfhlry, rendered her imprisonment more into-

to hold no farther correspondence '.ith the Queen

negociations, the Queen's partisans in Scotland,

Manud were wonderfully elevated. Maitland was the foul
i^plrote° of that party, and the person whose ativity and

Lt. ability the Regent chiefly dreaded. He had laid

the plan of that intrigue which had kindled such
combustion in England. He continued to so-
ment the spirit of difaffedion in Scotland, and
had seduced from the Regent Lord Home,
Kirkaldy, and several of his former associates.
While he enjoyed liberty, the Regent could not
reckon his own power secure. For this reason,
having by an artifice allured Maitland to Stir.
ling, he employed Captain Crawfurd, one of his

hands of the person to whose care he was committed,

time was entirely under M.litland's command "'.
'he los. of a pl.ce of so much importance, and
the defection of a man so eminent for military Ikill as

Eliz.lbeth, about this time, abundantly compensated.

tilh Queen to liberty having been discovered, and "ai""f Eli

purpose, by force of arms; but the issue of it herens.
was not more fortunate. The Earls of Nor-
thumberland and WeRmorland, though little
diftinguifled by their personal abilities, were
two of the most ancient and powerful of the
Eighlflt Peers. Their eltates in the northern
counties were great, and they possessed that in-
tlucce over the inhabitants, which was heredi.
tary in the popular and martial families of Percy
and of Nevil.. They were both attached to the
Popifli religion, and discontented with the court,

Queen was not their sole object They aimed at
bringing about a' change in the religion, and a
revolution in the government of the kingdom.
For this reason they filicited the aid of the King
of Spain, the avowed and zealous patron of Popery
in that age. Nothing could be more delightful to
the restless spirit of Philip, or more necessary
towards facilitating his schemes in the Netherlands,
than the involving England in the confusion and
miseries of a civil war. The Duke of Alva, by
his direction, encouraged the two Earls, and pro.
mifed, as soon as they either took the field with
their forces, or surprised any place of strength, or
rescued the Queen of Scots, that he would sup.
ply them both with money and a firong body of
troops. La Mothe, the Governor of Dunkirk,
in the disguise of a sailor, founded the ports

though fle furpeded nothing of their real design,
she concluded that they were among the number

for this reason, to repair to court. Conscious of
guilt, and afraid of discovery, they delayed giving
obedience. A second, and more peremptory order
wa, iffied. This they could not decline, without
shaking off their allegiance; and as no time was No.. 9:

the Catholic religion; the fettling the order of fuc-

nobility; were the motives which they alledged to
justify their rebellion '". Many of the lower people
flocked to them with such arms as they could pro-
cure; and had the capacity of the leaders been, in
any degree, equal to the enterprise, it mull have
soon grown to be extremely formidable. Elizabeth
aced with prudence and vigor; and was served
by her fubjeds with fidelity and ardor. On

that he resolved to return by the fame gate through

the crime naturally fell on those who expressed
fiich indecent joy at the commifion of it; and as
the affallin made his escape on a horse which
belonged to Lord Claud Hamilton, and fled
diretdly to Hamilton, where he was received in
triumph, it was concluded that the Regent had

party, rather than to the revenge of a private

for this purpose, an amicable conference among
the leaders of the two fadions. But while the one
demanded the restoration of the Queen, as the
only thing which could re-establish the public
tranquillity; while the other esteemed the King's
authority to be so sacred, that it was, on no
account, to be called in question or impaired; and
neither of them would recede in the least point
from their opinions, they separated without any
profped of concord. Both were rendered more
averse from reconcilement, by the hope of foreign
aid. An envoy arrived from France with promises
of powerful succour to the Queen's adherents; and
as the civil wars in that kingdom seemed to be
on the point of terminating in peace, it was
expected that Charles would soon be at liberty to
fulfil what he promised. On the other hand, the

diately after the murder of the Regent, prompted

depredations. As Elizabeth foreraw, on the one
hand, the dangerous consequences of rendering this
a national quarrel; and resolved, on the other,

so much on their own strength as to venture
either to eled a Regent, or to take the field against
the Queen's party; but the afliftance which they
received from Elizabeth, enabled them to do both.
By her order, Sir William Drury marched into
Scotland, with a thousand foot and three hundred
horse; the King's adherents joined him with a
considerable body of troops: and advancing towards
Glasgow, where the adverse party had already
begun hostilities by attacking the castle, they
forced them to retire, plundered the neighbouring
country, which belonged to'the Hamiltons, and,
after seizing some of their castles, and rafing
others, returned to Edinburgh.

eprd to the government of the kingdom to him, during
&tBL the minority of his grandson. His illustrious birth,

and alliance with the royal family of England, as

well as of Scotland, rendered him worthy of that Bo o !
honor. His refentmelnt againlt Mary being impla- vl.
cable, and his estate lying in England. and'his '570.
family residing there, Elizabeth confidered him as
a man who, both from inclination and from interest,
would at in concert with her, and ardently
wished that he mightfucceed Murray in the office
of Regent But, on many accounts, ffe did not
think it prudent to discover her own fenriments,
or to favor his pretensions too openly. The civil
wars in France, which had been excited by a
pretended zeal for religion. and carried on with a
tiercenefs that dlid it real dishonor, appeared now
to be on the point of coming to an issue; and
after fieddling the best blood, and walling the
richest provinces in the kingdom, both parties
dfired peace with an ardor that facilitated the
negociations which were carrying on for that pur.
pose. Charles IX. was known to be a passionate
admirer of Mary's beauty. Nor could he, in
honor, susser a Queer? of France, and the mos
ancient ally of his crown, to languilh in her pre.
sent cruel situation, without attempting to procure
her relief. He had, hitherto, been obliged to
satisfy himself with remonstrating, by his ambaffa.
dors, against the indignity with which Ihe had
been treated. But if he were once at full liberty
to puifue his inclinations, Elizabeth would have
every thing to dread from the impetuosity of his
temper, and the power of his arms. It therefore
became necessary for her to aft with some reserve,
and not to appear, avowedly, to countenance

o ox the choice of a Regent, in contempt of Mary's
vl. authority. The jealousy and prejudices of the
ass. Scots required no less management. Had the openly

supported Lenox's claim; had she recommended
him to the Convention, as the candidate of whom
{be approved; this might have roused the inde.
pendent spirit of the nobles, and by too plain a
discovery of her intention, the might have defeated
its fucce&s For there reasons, The hesitated long,
and returned ambiguous answers to all the mefllges
which the received from the King's party. A more
explicit declaration of her sentiments was at las
obtained, and an event of an extraordinary nature
seems to have been the occasion of it. Pope Pius V.
having issued a bull, whereby he excommunicated
Elizabeth, deprived her of her kingdom, and
absolved her fubjeds from their oath of allegiance,
Felton, an Englihiman, had the boldness to fix
it on the gates of the Bilhop of London's palace.
In former ages, a Pope, moved by his own
ambition, or pride, or bigotry, denounced this
fatal sentence against the moRs powerful monarchs;
but as the authority of the court of Rome was
now lets regarded, its proceedings were more
cautious; and it was only when they were roused
by some powerful Prince, that the thunders of
the church were ever beard. Elizabeth, therefore,
imputed this ftep, which the Pope bad taken, to
a combination of the Roman Catholic Princes
against her, and fufpeted that some plot was
formed in favor of the Scottilb Queen. In that
event, The knew that the safety of her own kingdom

depended on preserving her influence in Scotland; B O O X
and in order to ftrengthcn this, she renewed her vl.
promises of protecting the King's adherents, en. 'a 7
couraged them to proceed to the eletion of a
Regent, and even ventured to point out the Earl
of Lenox, as the person who had the belt title.
That honor was accordingly conferred upon him,
in a Convention of the whole party, held on the
12th of July'.

The Regent's first care was to prevent the meet- Le.ox *ite
ing of the Parliament, which the Queen's party ed BeR',
had summoned to convene at Linlithgow. Having.
effeded that, he marched against the Ea(l of
Buntly, Mary's Lieutenant in the North, anmd
forced the garrison which he had placed in Brechin,
to surrender at discretion. Soon after, he made
himself master of some other carles. Emboldened
by this successful beginning of his adminiRfration,
as well as by the appearance of a considerable
army, with which the Earl of Suffex hovered on
the borders, he deprived Maitland of his office of
Secretary, and proclaimed him, the Duke, Huntly,
and other leaders of the Queen's party, traitors
and enemies of their country '.

In this desperate Situation of their affairs, the Marye'sde.
Queen's adherents had recourse to the King of rte t goei
Spain', with whom Mary had held a close corre. spai.
fpondence ever since her confinement in England.

agreed upon; and, being renewed from time to vl.
time, it continued till the first of April next year". "170

Soon after, Elizabeth dispatched Cecil and Sir
Walter Mildmay to the Queen of Scots. The dignity
of these ambassadors, the former her prime Minis-
ter, the latter Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
one of her ablest counsellors, convinced all parties
that the negociation was serious, and that the hour
of Mary's liberty was ndw approaching. The pro-
positions which they made to her, were advan.
tageous to Elizabeth, but such as a Prince; in
Mary's situation, had reason to expec. The ratifi-
cation of the treaty of Edinburgh; the renouncing
any pretensions to the Englifl Crown, during
Elizabeth's own life, or that of her posterity; the
adhering to the alliance between the two king-
doms; the pardoning her fubjeas who bad taken
arms against her; and her promising to hold no
correspondence, and to countenance no enterprise,
that might disturb Elizabeth's government; were
among the chief articles. By way of security for
the accomplishment of these, they demanded that
some persons of rank Ihould be given as holtages,
that the Prince her son lhould reside in England,
and that a few castles on the borders flould be put
into Elizabeth's hands. To some of these propofi.
tions Mary contented; some The endeavoured to
mitigate; and others The attempted to. evade. In

and by his great efforts at this time against the
Turks, his treasury 'was entirely exhaufled. Char.
les had already begun to meditate that confpiray
against the Hugonots, wbich marks bis reign with
such infamy; and it required much eIifure, and
perse~ tranquillity, to bring that execrable plan
to maturity. Philip was employed in fitting oul

Chiftian arms, by the victory over the infidc
at Lepanto; the Moors in Spain threatened an
infurredion. and his fubjeds in the Netherlands,
provoked by much oppreclion and many ipdigni

Under all the disadvantages of a rigorous confine.

in k.ngland, which were extremely formidable.
What dcfperate effefts of her just resentment might
be expected, if she were set at liberty, and recovered
her former power ? What engagements could bind
her, not to revenge the wrongs which The had sus-
sered. nor to take advantage of the favorable con-
junctures that might present themselves? Was it
poflible for her to give such security for her be-
haviour, in tinmes to come, as might remove all
Iifpicions and fears ? And was there not good
cause to conclude, that no future benefits could
ever obliterate the memory of pafl injuries ? It was
thus Elizabeth reasoned; though Ihe continued to
aft as if her views had been entirely different. She
appointed seven of her privy counsellors to be
commiflioners for fettling the articles of the
treaty; and, as Mary had already named the
Bilhops of Ross and Galloway, and Lord Leving.

to impower proper persons to appear in behalf of

remove the obstacles which flood in the way ol
their miRrers's liberty. But when Morton and hit
aflociates were called upon to vindicate their con.
dua, and to explain the sentiments of their party,
they began, in juftificatioir of their treatment ol
the Queen, to advance such maxims concerning
the limited powers of Princes, and the naturl
right of fubjeds to resist and to control them,
as were extremely shocking to Elizabeth, whos
notions of regal prerogative, as has been formerly
observed, were very exalted. With regard to the
authority which the King nowpoflelfed, thej
declared that they neither had, nor could poflibl)
receive inftrudcions, to content to any treaty, that
tended to subvert, or even to impair it in the leaf
degree ". Nothing could be more trifling anc
ridiculous, than such a reply from the commil
fioners of the King of Scots to the Queen of Eng

and to her power he owed the continuance of hi
reign. With the utmost ease she could have brough

the reply made by Morton furnifled her with a
pretence for putting a flop to the negociation, until tarch -4,
the Regent (hould fend ambassadors with more
ample powers. Thus, after being amused for ten
months with the hopes of liberty, the unhappy
Queen of Scots remained under arifter custody
than ever, and without any profped of escaping
from it; while those fubjeds, who still adhered to
her, were exposed , without ally or protetor, tb
the raze of enemies, whom their success in this
ncgociation rendered Rill more insolent".

On the day after the expiration of the truce, Ditnhrnrit
vhich had been observed with little exatnefs on " "` r-'r
either fi.le, Captain Crawford of Jordan-hill, a Regent.
gillant and enterprising officer, performed a service
of great importance to the Regent, by fiurprifing
the castle of Dunbarton. This was the only fortified
place in the kingdom, of which the Queen had
kept poffefion, ever since the commencement of the
civil wars. Its situation on the top of a high and
almost inaccessible rock, which rifes in the middle
ofa plain, rendered it extremely strong, and, in
the opinion of that age, impregnable; as it com-
manded the river Clyde, it was of great consequence,
and was deemed the most proper place in the kingdom

3 o o K for landing any foreign troops that might cometo

vi. Mary's aid. The strength of the place rendered
1571. Lord Fleming, the governor, more secure than he

ought to have been, confidering its importance.
A soldier, who had served in the garrison, and
had been difgufled by some ill usage, proposed the
scheme to the Regent, endeavoured to demonstrate
that it was pracicable, and offered himself to go
the foremost man on the enterprise. It was thought
prudent to risk any danger for so great a prize.
Scaling-ladders, and whatever else might be nece.
fary, were prepared with the utmot secrecy and
dispatch. All the avenues to the castle were seized,
that no intelligence of the design might reach the
governor. Towards evening, Crawford marched
from Glasgow, with a small but determined band.
By midnight, they arrived at the bottom of the
rock. The moon was set, and the lky, which
hitherto had been extremely clear, was covered
with a thick fog. It was where the rock was highest,
that the assailants made their attempt, because in
that place there were few sentinels, and they
hoped to find them leaf alert. The firRf ladder was
scarcely fixed, when the weight and eagernels of
those who mounted, brought it to the ground.
None of the alfailants were hurt by the fall, and
none of the garrison alarmed at the noise. Their
guide and Crawford scrambled up the rock, and
fatened the ladder to the roots of a tree which
grew in a deft. This place they all reached with
the utmost difficulty, but were Rill at a great
distance from the foot of the wall. Their ladde

was made salt a second time; but in the middle of B o o x
the ascent, they met with an unforeseen difficulty. VI.
One of their companions was seized with some 1
sudden fit, and clung, seemingly without life, to
the ladder. All were at a stand. It was impoflible
to pass him. To tumble him headlong was cruel;
and might occasion a discovery. But Crawford's
presence of mind did not forsake him. He ordered
the soldier to be bound fast to the ladder, that he
might not fall when the fit was over: and turning
the other fide of the ladder, they mounted, with
cafe, over his belly. Day now began to break,
and there still remained a high wall to scale; but
after surmounting so many great difficulties, this
was soon accomplilhed. A sentry observed the first
man who appeared on the parapet, and had just
time to give the alarm, before he was knocked
on the head. The officers and soldiers of the
garrison ran out naked, unarmed, and more folici-
tous about their own safety, than capable of mak-
ing reftRance. The assailants rulbed forwards, with
repeated shouts, and with the utmost fury; took
polilelion of the magazine; seized the cannon; and
turned them against their enemies. Lord Fleming
got into a small boat, and fled all alone into Ar-
gylehlire. Crawford, in reward of his valorand good
conduct, remained malfer of the castle; and as he did
not lose a single man in the enterprise, he enjoyed his
success with unmixed pleasure. Lady Fleming, Verac
the French Envoy, and Hamilton Archbilhop of St.
Andrews, were theprifoners of greatest diftinsion",

the number of his garrison, and to provide every vl

declaring Lenox's authority to be unlawful and
uforped; commanded all who favored his cause
to leave the town within fix hours; seized the arms
belonging to the citizens; planted a battery on the
fleeple of St Giles's, repaired the walls, and fortified
the gates of the city; and, though the affetions
of the inhabitants leaned a different way, held out
the metropolis against the Regent. The Duke,
Huntly, Home, Herries, and other chiefs of that
fa&ion, repaired to Edinburgh with their followers;
and having received a finall fum of money, and
some ammunition from France, formed no con-
temptible army within the walls. On the other fide,
Nlorton seized Leith, and fortified it; and the
Regent joined him with a conliderable body of
men. While the armies lay so near each other,
daily skirmishes happened, and with various fuc-
cess. The Queen's party was not Rrong enough
to take the field against the Regent, nor was his
superiority so great as to undertake the fieye of
the castle, or of the town ".

Some time before Edinburgh fell into the hands Both par.
of his enemies, the Regent had summoned a par- ti"chol"

liament to meet in that place. In order to pre- May 14.

meeting, the members obeyed the proclamation
as exadly as possible; and assembled in a house

ings might be countenanced by the fame. how of

after. There was produced in this assembly a decla.
ration by the Queen, of the invalidity of that deed
whereby hne had resigned the Crown, and con-
sented to the coronation of her son. Conformable to
this declaration, an ad wa, passed, pronouncing the
resignation to have been extorted by fear; to be null
in itself, and in all its consequences; and enjoining
all good fubjeds to acknowledge the Queen alone to
be their lawful Sovereign, and to support those who
aced in her name. The present eftablilbment of the
Protestant religion was confirmed by another Ratute;
and, in imitation of the adverse party, a new
meeting was appointed on the 26th of Augulf".

contidence which hold mankind together in society. Vt
Religious zeal mingled itself which these civil '17I
dijftltilons, and contributed not a little to heighten
anwl to inflme them.

]'he factions which divided the kingdom were, State of
in appearance, only two. But, in both there, there I't,"aO
were pirflns with views and principles so different
fromn each other, that they ought to be diftinguifled.
With fhme, considerations of religion were pre-
dominant, and they either adhered to the Queen,
because they hoped, by her means, to re-establish
Popery, or they defended the King's authority, as
the belt support of the Protestant faith. Among
these the opposition was violent and irreconcileable.
Others were influenced by political motives only,
or allured by views of interest; the Regent aimed
at uniting there, and did not despair of gaining,
by gentle arts, many of Mary's adherents to ac-
knowledge the King's authority. Maitland and
Kirkaldy had formed the fame design of a coalition,
but on such terms, that the Queen might be
reltored to some share in the government, and the
kinglom (hake off its dependence upon England.
I\lorton, the ablest, the most ambitious, and the
moRl powerful man of the King's party, held a
particular course; and moving only as he was
prompted by the court of England, thwarted every
rneafure that tended towards a reconcilement of
the factions; and as he served Elizabeth with much
fidelity, he derived both power and credit from
her avowed protetion.

0oo0 The time appointed by both parties for the
vl. meeting of their parliaments now approached.
t15-. Only three peers and two bislops appeared in that

which was held in the Queen's name at Edinburgh.
But, contemptible as their numbers were, they
palled an at for attainting upwards of two hundred
of the adverse fadion. The meeting at Stirling
was numerous and splendid. The Regent had

and Lord Boyd, to acknowledge the King's author.
ity. The three Earls were among-the moftRpower.
ful noblemen in the kingdom, and had hitherto
been zealous in the Queen's cause. Lord.Boyd
had been one of Mary's commiflioners at York
and Westminster, and, since that time, had been
admitted into all her mos secret councils. But,
during that turbulent period, the condut ol
individuals, as well as the principles of facions,
varied so often, that the sense of honor, a chief
preservative of confifence in character, was entirely
loft; and, without any regard to decorum, men
suddenly abandoned one party, and adopted all
the violent paflions of the other. The defetion,
however, of so many persons of diftindion not
only weakened the Queen's party, but added
reputation to her adversaries.

-K Iog's After the example of the parliament at Edin
"I fr," burgh, that at Stirling began with framing a&c
srlirng. against the opposite faction. But in the midst ol

all the security, which confidence in their own
numbers, or distance from danger could inspire,
they were awakened, early on the morning ao

September third by the /houts of the enemy in Bo o
the heart of the town. In a moment the houses Vl.
of every person of diftindion were surrounded, s 7*
and before they knew what to think of so Rrange SPt
an event, the Regent, the Earls of Argyll, Morton,
Glencairn, Caflils, Eglinton, Montrose, Buchan,
the Lords Sempil, Cathcart, Ogilvie, were all made
prisoners, and mounted behind troopers, who were
ready to carry them to Edinburgh. Kirkaldy was
the author of this daring enterprise; and if he had
not been induced by the ill-timed solicitude of his
friends about his safety, not to hazard his own
pelfon in conducting it, that day might have ter-
minated the contest between the two fadions, and
have restored peace to his country. By his direction,
four hundred men, under the command of Huntly,
Lord Claud Hamilton, and Scot of Buccleugh, set
out from Edinburgh, and, the better to conceal
their design, marched towards the south. But they
loon wheeled to the right, and horses having been
provided for the infantry, rode firaight to Stirling.
By four in the morning, they arrived there; not
one sentry was posted on the walls, not a single man
was awake about the place. They met with no
refifance from any person whom they attempted to
seize, except Morton. lie defending his house with
obtinate valor, they were obliged to set it on fire,
and he did not surrender till forced out of it by
the flames. In performing this, some time was
consumed; and the private men, unaccustomed to
regular discipline, left their colors, and began
to rifle the houses and Shops of the citizens. The

3oot noise and uproar in the town reached the caBle.
VI. The Earl of Mar rallied out with thirty soldiers;

7 fired brilkly upon the enemy, of whom almost none

but the officers kept together in a body. The
townsmen took arms to affif their governor; X
sudden panic struck the assailants; some fled, some
surrendered tbemfelves to their own prisoners; and
had not the borderers, who followed Scot, prevent-
ed a purfiit, by carrying off all the horses within
the place, not a man would have escaped. If the
Regent had not unfortunately been killed, the los
on the King's fide would have been as inconsiderable,
as the alarm was great. Think on the Archbishop of
St. Andrcw', was the word among the Queen's

he sr. soldiers; and Lenox fell a sacrifice to his memory.
" ' 'e The officer, to whom he surrendered, endeavouring

to protet him, loft his own life in his defence.
He was slain, according to the general opinion, by
command of Lord Claud Hamilton. Kirkaldy had
the glory of concerting this plan with great secrecy
and prudence; but Morton's fortunate obstinacy,
and the want of discipline among his own troops,
deprived him of success, the only thing wanting
to render this equal to the most applauded military
enterprifcs of the kind ".

Mar ,~, . As so many of the nobles were assembled, they
Rese"n proceeded, without delay, to the election of a Re.

gent. Argyll, Morton, and Mar, were candidates
for the office. Mar was chosen by a majority of
voices. Amidst all the fierce dissensions which

" Melv. 226. Craw. . 0M . o4.

had prevailed so long in Scotland, he had diftin. B 0 0 k.
guilhed himself by his moderation, his humanity, vt.
and his diintereftednefs. As his power was far 17.
inferior to Argyll's, and his abilities not so great
as Morton's, he was, for these reasons, less for.
midable to the other nobles. His merit, too, in.
having so lately rescued the leaders of the party.
from imminent deftruaion, contributed not a little
to his preferment.

While these things were carrying on in Scotland,. Proceedinp
the tranfations in England were no less interesting in 'ngla4
to Mary, and fill' more fatal to her cause. The, awl,
parliament of that kingdom, which met in April,
pafled an ad, by which it was declared to be high
treason to claim any right to the Crown during.
the life of the Queen; to affirm that the title of
any other person was better than hers, or to maintain:
that the parliament had not power to fettle and to.
limit the order of fucceflion. This remarkable statute
was intended not ohl for the security of their own
Sovereign, but to curb the reflefs and intriguing,
spirit of the Scottish Queen, and her adherents ".

At this time, a treaty of marriage between Mairag
Elizabeth and the Duke of Anjou, the French o*g^"ated'

between iU.

Kings brother, was well advanced. Both courts zabth and
teemed to desire it with equal ardor, and gave the DUeof
out, with the utmoR confidence, that it could Anjo
not fail of taking place. Neither of them, how.
ever, wished it success; and they encouraged it
for no other end, but becaue it served to covte

r o o or to promote their particular designs. The whole

vI. policy of Catherine of Medicis was bent toward
"7?L the accomplifflment of her dcteRable projea for

the deftml;on of the Hugonot chiefs; and by
orrying on a negociation for the marriage of her son
with a Princeis who was juflly esteemed the prote;'
trefs of that party, by yielding some things in point
of religion, and by discovering an indifference with
regard to others, she hoped to amuse all the ProteR.
ants in Europe, and to lull asleep thejealoufyeven of
the Hugonots themselves. Elizabeth flattered hetdelf
with reaping advantages of another kind. During
the dependence of the negociation, the French could
not with decency give any open afliflance to the
Scottilh Queen; if they conceived any hopes of f.
cess in the treaty of marriage, theyiwould, of course,
interest themselves but coldly in her concerns; Mary
berfelf must be dejeded at losing an ally, whoii te
bad hitherto reckoned her most powerful protedor;
and by interrupting her correspondence with Franme,
one source, at lealt, of the cabals' and intiuues
which disturbed the kingdom, wouldbe Ropt.. Both
Queens succeeded in their schemes Catherlde's
artifices imposed on Elizabeth, and blinded tbe
Hugonots. '1 be French discovered the utmost indif.
ference about the interest of the Scottilh Queen;
and Mary, confidering that court as really united
with her rival, turned for protection, with more
eagerness than ever, towards the King of Spain".

money. Ridolphi, a Florentine gentleman, who i, fv,,r
resided at London under the characer of a banker, of 'lary
and who acted privately as an agent for the Pope,
was the person whom the Bilhop intruRed with this
negociation. Mary thought it neceffiry, likewise,
to communicate the secret to the Duke of Norfolk,
whom Elizabeth had lately ieftored to liberty, upon
his solemn promise to have no further intercourse
with the Queen of Scots. This promise, however,
he regarded so little, that he continued to keep a
conlfant correspondence with the captive Queen;
while file labored to nourilh his ambitious hopes,
and to strengthen his amorous attachment by letters
written in the fondest caressing irain. Some of these
he must have received at the very time when he
made that solemn promise of holding no farther
intercourse with her, in consequence of which
Elizabeth restored him to liberty. Mary, fill con.
fidering him as her future hulband, took no Rep in
ally matter of moment without his advice. She
early communicated to him her negociations
with Ridolphi; and in a long letter; which she
wrote to him in cyphers ', after complaining of
the baseness with which the French court had
abandoned her interest, fte declared her intention

both of explaining and advancing the scheme. The
Duke commanded Hickford, his secretary, to
decypher, and then to burn this letter; but whe
ther he had been already gained by the court, ot
resolved at that time to betray his master, he
disobeyed the latter part of the order, and bid
the letter, together with other treasonable papers,
under the Duke's own bed.

Ridolphi, in a conference with Norfolk, omit.

ted none of those arguments, and spared none of
thife promises, which are the usual incentives to
rebellion. The Pope, he told him, had a great
fum in readiness to bellow in so good a caue.
The Duke of Alva had undertaken to land ten
thousand men not far from London. The Ca.
tholics to a man would rife in arms. Many of
the nobles were ripe for a revolt, and wanted only
a leader. Half the nation had turned their eyes
towards him, and called on him to revenge the
umerited injuries which he himself had suffered;
and to rescue an unfortunate Queen, who offered
him her hand, and her crown, as the reward ol
his success. Norfolk approved of the design, and
though he refused to give Ridolphi any letter of

received some imperfet information of the plot, Auguta.
by intercepting one of Ridolphi's agents; and anl
accident happened, which brought t6 light all the
circumltances of it. The Duke had employed Hick.
ford to transmit to Lord Herries, fonme money,
which was to be distributed among Mary's friends
in Scotland. A person not in the secret was intrufed
with conveying it to the borders, and he, fufped-
ing it from the weight to be gold, whereas he had
been told that it was silver, carried it direAly to
the Privy Council. The Duke, his domestics, and
all who were privy, or could be fufpeted of being
privy to the design, were taken into cultody.
Never did the accomplices in a conspiracy discover Sept. r;
lefI firmness, or servants betray an indulgent mailer
with greater baseness. Every one confessed the
whole of what he knew. Hickford gave direcions
how to find the papers which he had hidden. The
Duke himself, relying at first on the fidelity of his
allociates, and believing all dangerous papers to
have been destroyed, confidently asserted his own
innocence; but when their depositions and the
papers themselves were produced, atlonilhed at
their treachery, he acknowledged his guilt, and
implored the Queen's mercy. His offence was too

The Bilhop of Ross, who appeared by the confe

confinement, set at liberty, on condition that he
flould leave the kingdom. Mary was not only
deprived of a servant, equally eminent for his zeal
and his abilities, but was denied from that time the
privilege of having an ambalfdor at the Englilh
court. The Spanish ambassador, whom the power
and dignity of the prince he represented exempted

defensive alliance between the two Crowns. He
confidered such a treaty, not only as the beRf device
for blinding the Protestants, against whom the con-
fpiracy was now almost ripe for execution; but as
a good precaution, likewise, against the dangerous
consequences to which that atrocious measure might
expose him. Elizabeth, 'who had hitherto reigned
without a single ally, now saw her kingdom so
threatened with intestine commotions, or exposcd
to invasions from abroad, that iTe was extremely
Solicitous to secure the assistance of so powerful a
neighbour. The difficulties arising from the situation
of the Scottish Queen, were the chief occasions of
any delay. Charles demanded some terms of advan-
tage for Mary and her party. Elizabeth refused to
liften to any proposition of that kind. Her obstinacy
overcame the faint efforts of the French Monarch.

treaty, France and England affected to at in
concert with regard to Scotland, and Le Croc,
and Sir William Drury, appeared there, in name
of their refpedive Sovereigns. By their mediation,
a truce for two months was agreed upon, and
during that time conferences were to be held
between the leaders of the opposite fadions, in
order toaccommodate their differences, and restore
peace to the kingdom. This truce afforded a
seasonable interval of tranquillity to the Queen's
adherents in the South; but in the North it proved
fatal to her interest. Sir Adam Gordon had flill
maintained his reputation and superiority there.
Several parties, under different officers, were sent
against him. Some of them he attacked in the
field; against others he employed stratagem; and
as his courage and condud were equal, none of
his enterprises failed of success. He made war,
too, with the humanity which became so gallant
a man, and gained ground by that, no less than
by the terror of his arms. If he had not been
obliged, by the truce, to suspend his operations,
he would, in all probability, have brought that

thing could be more offensive to that nation, jealous
of foreigners, and terrified at the profped of the
Spanilh yoke, than her negociations with the Duke
of Alva. The parliament, which met in May;
proceeded against her as the most dangerous enemy
of the kingdom; and after a solemn conference
between the Lords and Commons, both houses
agreed in bringing in a bill to declare her guilty
of high treason. and to deprive her of all right of
fucceflion to the Crown. This great caule, as it
was then called, occupied them during the whole
session, and was carried on with much unanimity.
Elizabeth, though She applauded their zeal, and
approved greatly of the course they were taking,
was satisfied with ihowing Mary what the might
expet from the resentment of the nation; but as

T aesma The alliance with France afforded Elizabeth
r" Y'* much fatisfadtion, and she expeded from it a great

jncreafe of security. She now turned her whole
attention towards Scotland, where the animofities
of the two factions were fill so high, and so many
interfering interests to be adjusted, that a general
pacification seemed to be at a great distance. But
while lhe labored to bring them to some agreement,
an event happened which filled a great part of
Europe with aftnnilbment and with horror. This
was the massacre of Paris; an attempt to which
there is no parallel in the history of mankind,
either for the long train of craft and difiimulagion
with which it was contrived, or for the cruelty
and barbarity with which it was carried into
execution. By the moR solemn promises of safety
and of favor, the leaders of the Protestants were
drawn to court; and though doomed to deltruc-
tion, they were received with caresses, loaded with
honors, and treated, for seven months, with every
poflible mark of familiarity and of confidence. In
Aat m. the midst of their security, the warrant for their

deftrution was issued by their Sovereign, on whole
word they had relied; and, in obedience to it,

" Jebb, iL s52.

their countrymen, their fellow.citizens, and com. B oO g
panions, imbrued their hands in their blood. Ten vi.
thousand Protestants, without distinction of age, 1x7.
or sex, or condition, were murdered in Paris alone.
The fame barbarous orders were sent to other parts
of the kingdom, and a like carnage ensued. This
deed, which no Popilh writer, in the present age,
mentions without detestation, was, at the time,
applauded in Spain; and at Rome solemn thanks.
rivings were offered to God for its success But
among the Protestants, it excited incredible horror;
a finking piaure of which is drawn by the French
Ambaffidor at the court of England, in his account
of his first audience after the massacre. " A gloomy
forrnw, fays he, fat on every face: silence, as in
the dead of night, reigned through all the chambers
of the royal apartment; the ladies and courtiers
were ranged on each fide, all clad in deep mourn-
ing, and as I passed through them, not one be-
flowed on me a civil look, or made the leaR return
to my salutes ".

But horror was not the only passion with which oetrimetal
this event inspired the Protestants; it filled them to Man''

intattt.

with fear. 1 hey confidered it as the prelude to
some greater blow, and believed, not without
much probability, that all the Popilh Princes had
conspired the deftrudion of their fe. This opi-
nion was of no small disservice to Mary's affairs
in Scotland. Many of her adherents were Pro-
teflants; and, though they wilhedherreltoration,
" Carte, iii S22.

o o Ot were not willing, on that account, to facrisce the
vi. faith which they profelfed. They dreaded her
a7i. attachment to a religion, which allowed its vo.

taries to violate the moR solemn engagements,
and prompted them to perpetrate the most bar.
barons crimes. A general confederacy of the
Protestants seemed to them the only thing that
could uphold the Reformation against the league
which was formed to overturn it. Nor could the
present eftabliffiment of religion be long maintained
in Britain, but by a ftrit union with Elizabeth,
and by the concurrence of both nations, in espousing
the defence of it, as a common cause ".

Encouraged by this general difpoftion to place

confidence in her, Elizabeth resumed a scheme
which Ihe had formed during the regency of the
Earl of Murray, of fending Mary as a prisoner into
Scotland. But her sentiments and situation were
now very different from what they had been during
her negociation with Murray. Her animosity
againRf the Queen of Scots was greatly augmented,
by recent experience of her inclination as well as
power not only to disturb the tranquillity of her
reign, but to wreR from her the crown; the party
in Scotland favorable to Mary, was almoR entirely
broken; there was no reason to dread any danger
from France, which Rill continued to court her
friendliip. She aimed, accordingly, at something
very different from that which The had in view
three years before. Then The discovered a laudable

" Digges, 44+. 267.

solicitude not only for the safety of Mary's life, o ox
but for securing to her, treatment suited to her vt.
rank. Now bhe required, as an express condition, tl%.
that, immediately after Mary's arrival in Scotland,
fie ihould be brought to public trial; and having
no doubt that sentence would be passed according
to her deserts, tie infilted that, for the good of
both kingdoms, it Ihould be executed without
delay ". No tranifation, perhaps, in Elizabeth's
reign, merits more severe censure. Eager to cut
short the days of a rival, the objec both of her
hatred and dread, and no less anxious to avoid the
blame to which such a deed of violence might
expose her, fle labored, with timid and ungenerous
artifice, to transfer the odium of it from herself to
Mary's own fubjets. The Earl of Mar, happily
for the honor of his country, had more virtue than
to liften to such an ignominious proposal; and
Elizabeth did not venture to renew it.

While Ihe was engaged in pursuing this in. ThbRetti
fidious measure, the Regent was more honorably "ueavoun
employed in endeavouring to negociate a general both pah
peace among his countrymen. As he labored 'ti
for this purpose with the utmost zeal, and the
adverse faction placed entire confidence in his
integrity, his endeavours could hardly have failed
of being successful. Maitland and Kirkaldy came
so near to an agreement with him, that scarce any
thing remained, except the formality of signing
the treaty. But Morton had not forgotten the

BO K disappointment be met with in his pretensions to

VL the Regency; his abilities, his wealth, and 'the
zsr. patronage of the court of England, gave him

greater sway with the party, than even the Regent
bimfelf; and he took pleasure in thwarting every
measure pursued by him. He was afraid that, if
Maitland and his aflociates recovered any fbare in
the administration, his own influence would be
considerably diminilbed; and the Regent, by their
means, would regain that ascendant which belonged
to his station. With him concurred all those who
were in possession of the lands which belonged to
any of the Queen's party. His ambition, and
their avarice, frustrated the Regent's pious inten.
tions, and retarded a bleifing so necessary to the
kingdom, as the eflablifibment of peace ".
Hkiati. Such a discovery of the felfilTnefs and ambition

which reigned among his party, made a deep im.
pression on the Regent, who loved his country,
and wilhed for peace with much ardor. This
inward grief broke his spirit, and by degrees
brought on a fettled melancholy, that ended in a
distemper, of which he died on the twenty-ninth
of Oaober. He was, perhaps, the only person
in the kingdom who could have enjoyed the
office of Regent without envy, and have left it
without loss of reputation. NotwithRanding their
mutual animofities, both fafions acknowledged
bis views to be honorable, and his integrity to be
uncorrupted ".

As the truce had been prolonged to the first of

the negociations with the opposite party, which
had been set on foot by his predecessor. They
produced no effeets, however, till the beginning
of the next year.

Before we proceed to these, some events, hitherto
untouched, deserve our notice.

The Earl of Northumberland, who had been
kept prisoner in Lochlevin ever since his flight
into Scotland in the year one thousand five hundred
and fixty.nine, was given up to Lord Hunfdon,
governor of Berwick; and being carried to York,
suffered there the punishment of his rebellion. The
King's party were so sensible of their dependence on
Elizabeth's protection, that it was scarcely poflible
for them to refuse putting into her hands a person
who had taken up arms againt her. But as a fum of
money was paid on that account, and lhared between
Morton and Douglas of Lochlevin, the former of
whom, during his exile in England, had been much
indebted to Northumberland's friendship, the aban-
doning this unhappy nobleman, in such a manner,
to certain deltruEtion, was universally condemned as
a most ungrateful and mercenary adcion 4.

0oo0 This year was remarkable for a considerable
vl. innovation in the government of the Church. Soon
s71- after the Keformatioa, the Poplib bishops had been

Agin. of
·,c.-A. confirmed by law in poffeflion of part of their

benefices; but the spiritual jurifdition, which
belonged to their order, was exercised by fuperin.
tendants, though with more moderate authority.
On the death of the Archbilbop of St. Andrews,
Morton obtained from the Crown a grant of the
temporalities of that fee. But as it was thought
indecent for a layman to hold a benefice to which
the cure of fouls was annexed, he procured Douglas,
rector of the Univcrfity of St. Andrews, to be
chosen Archbillop; and allotting him afiwallpenfion
out of the revenues of the fee, retained the remainder
in his own hands. The nobles, who saw the advan.
ages they might reap from such a practice, sup.
ported him in the execution of his plan. It gave
great offence, however, to the clergy, who,
inflead of perpetuating an order whole name and
power was odious to them, wified that the revenues
which had belonged to it might be employed in
supplying such parihbes as were Rill unprovided
with fttled pallors. But, on the one hand, it
would have been rahb in the Clergy to have irritated
too much noblemen, on whom the very exiRence
of the Protestant Church in Scotland depended;
and NMorton, on the other, conduded his fchmeo
with such dexterity, and managed them with so
muchart, that it was, at las, agreed, ina convention
composed of the leading men among the Clergy,
together with a committee of privy council,

" that the name and office of Archbilhop, and B o o K
Biflop, flould be continued during the King's , v.
minority, and these dignities be conferrel upon i172
the bell qualified among the P'oteftant Ministers;
uut that, with regard to their spiritual jurifdiclions,
they (hould be subjed to the general assembly of
the Church. The rules to be observed in their

to the Dean and Chapter in times of Popery, were
likewise particularly specified ". The whole being

attending the Assembly by the ill state of his health,
though he declaimed loudly againlt the fimoniacal

of all the benefites I had that year [ I g ?.t ], was the coming
of that mol notible prophet and apostle of our nation, Mr John

This often betrayed him into indecent and undutiful

now render his character less amiable, fitted him to
be the inltrument of Providence for advancing the
Reformation among a ierce people, and enabled
him to face dangers, and to surmount oppoCition,
from which a person of a more gentle spirit would
have been apt to flrink back. By an unwearied
application to study and to business, as well as by
the frequency and fervor of his public discourses,
he had worn out a constitution naturally robust.

10OK Queen's party, if it remained entire, would be

VI. able to thwart and embarrass his adminifiration,
7t*l bhe resolved to divide and weaken it, by a separate

negociation. He made the sirs overture to Kirk.
aldy and his associates, and endeavoured to renew
the negociation with them, which, during the life
of his predecessor, had been broken off by his
own artifices. But Kirkaldy knew Morton's
views, and system of government, to be very
different from those of the former Regent. Miit.
land confidered him as a personal and implacable
enemy. They received repeated assurances of
protection from France; and though the siege of
Rochelle employed the French arms at that time;
the fame hopes, which had so often deceived the
party, fill amused them, and they expeced that
the obstinacy of the Hugonots would soon be
subdued, and that Charles would then be at
liberty to ad with vigor in Scotland. Mean.
while, a supply of money was sent, and if the
castle could be held out till Whitfunday, effec
tual aid was promised ". Maitland's genius de-
lighted in forming schemes that were dangerous;
and Kirkaldy possessed the intrepidity necessary
for putting them in execution. The castle, they
knew, was so situated, that it might defy all the
Regent's power. Elizabeth, they hoped, would
not violate the treaty with France, by fending
forces to his affifance; and if the French Ihould

might be poflible to deliver the Queen from cap- vl.
tivity, or at least to balance the influence of France s5a.
and England in such a manner, as to rescue Scot.
land from the dishonorable dependence upon the
latter, under which it had fallen. This splendid,
but chimerical projed, they preferred to the
friendllhip of Morton. They encouraged the
negociation, however, because it served to gain
time; they proposed, for the fame purpose, that
the whole of the Queen's party should be com-
prehended in it, and that Kirkaldy thould retain
thecommand of the catle fix months after the treaty
was signed. His interest prompted the Regent to
reject the former; his penetration discovered the
danger of complying with the latter; and all hopes
of accommodation vanished ".
As soon as the truce expired, Kirkaldy began to
fire on the city of Edinburgh, which by the return
of the inhabitants whom he had expelled, was
devoted as zealously as ever to the King's cause.
But as the Regent had now set on foot a treaty
with Chatelherault and Huntly, the cessation of
arms Rill continued with them.

They were less scrupulous than the other party, Acrepted by
and listened eagerly to his overtures. The Duke Chatelhe.
was naturally unsteady, and the approach of old aul'and
age increased his irresolution, and aversion to ac-
tion. The miseries of civil discord had affliced
Scotland almost five years, a length of time far

revlew the state of the nation, and compare the

among the nobles appear, manifestly, to have been
superior both in numbers and in power. But these
advantages were more than counterbalanced by
others, which their antagonists enjoyed. Political

humanity, until the Queen of England, whose
prisoners they were, should determine their fate.
Morton insisted that they Ihould susser the punilb.

declared that, so long as they were allowed to
live, he did not reckon his own person or authority
secure; and Elizabeth, without regarding Drury's
honor, or his promises in her name, gave them up
to the Regent's disposal. He first confined them to
separate prisons; and, soon after, with Elizabeth's
Lupa 3. consent, condemned Kirkaldy, and his brother, to

be hanged at the cross of Edinburgh. Maitland,
who did not expet to be treated more favorably,
prevented the ignominy of a public execution, by
a voluntary death, and "ended his days," fays
Melvil, " after the old Roman fathion"."

While the Regent was wreaking his vengeance

on the remains of her party in Scotland, Mary,
incapable of affording them any relief, bewailed

the fame time, her health began to be much VI.
impaired by confinement, and want of exercise. 1573.
At the entreaty of the French Ambassador, Lord
Shrewfl)ury her keeper was permitted to carry her
to Buxton wells, not far from Tuthbury, the place
of her imprisonment. Cecil, who lately had been
created B.ron of Burleigh, and Lord High Trea.
fircr of hnglind, happened to be there at the
fime time. l hough no minister ever entered more
warmly into the views of a Sovereign, or gave
frong,'r proofs of his fidelity and attachment, than
this great man, yet such was Elizabeth's distrust
of every person who approached the Queen of
Scots, that her suspicions, in consequence of this
interview, seem to have extended even to him;
and, while Mary jufily reckoned him her most
d,.ngerous enemy, he found some difficulty in per-
funding his own mistress that he was not partial
to that unhappy Queen ".

The Duke of Alva was this year recalled from
the government of the Netherlands, where his
haughty and oppreflive adminiflration roused a
spirit, in attempting to subdue which, Spain ex-
hauftld its treasures, ruined its armies, and loft
its glory. Requefens, who succeeded him, was of
a milder temper, and of a less enterprising genius.
This event delivered Elizabeth from the perpetual

the Scottish Queen, and his zeal for her interest.

petty trespasses were aggravated; and delinquents
were forced to compound for their lives, by the
payment of exorbitant fines. At the fame time,
the current coin was debased ", licences were fold

See Append. N'. XXVII.
The corruption of the coin, during Morton's adminif.

tration, was very great. Although the quantity of current
money coined out of a pound of bullion, was gradually
increased by former princes; the standard or fineness suffertd
little alteration, and the mixture of alloy was nearly the
fame with what is now used. But Morton mixed a fourth
part of alloy with every pound of silver, and funk, by
consequence, the value of coin in proportion. In the yer

unufnal taxes were imposed on commodities; and all vI.
the refinements in oppression, from which nations Sre.
so imperfectly polilhed as the Scots are usually
exempted, were put in practice. None of these
were complained of more loudly, or with greater
reason, than his injustice towards the Church.
The thirds of benefices, out of which the Clergy
received their subsistence, had always been slowly
and irregularly paid to collecors, appointed by
the General Assembly; and, during the civil wars,
no payment could be obtained in several parts
of the kingdom. Under color of redressing this
grievance, and upon a promise of alligning every
Alinifter a flipend within his own parifi, the
Regent extorted from the Church the thirds to
which they had right by law. But the Clergy,
inflead of reaping any advantage from this altera-
tion, found that payments became more irregular
and dilatory than ever. One Minister was com.
monly burdened with the care of four or five
palishes, a pitiful salary was allotted him, and the
Regent's insatiable avarice seized on the reft of

the Parliament had frequently declared him nex

among his countrymen, and enabled him, mor
than any other person in the kingdom, to counter
balance the Regent's power.

Soon after, at one of the fuual interviews betwee:

the wardens of the Scottlib and Englifb marches
a scuffle happened, in which the English wer
worsted; a few killed on the spot; and Sir Jame
I'orrefter, the warden, with several gentlemen wli

and the Regent were too sensible of the advantage
which resulted from the good underfIanding that
subsisted between the two kingdoms, to allow
this flight accident to interrupt it.

Sl^tt 'Though the persons raised to the dignity of Bilhop$
ricr. possessed very small revenues, and a very moderate

degree of power, the Clergy, to whom the Regent
and all his measures were become extremely odious
began to be jealous of that order. Knowing thai
corruptions fleal into the Church gradually, under
honorable names, and upon decent pretences, they
were afraid that, from such small beginning,, the
hierarchy might grow in time, to be as powerfu
and oppressive as ever. 'T he chief author of theft

of his manners, and the intrepidity of his mind. 1'57s
But, bred up in the retirement of a college, he

more attentive to the ends which he pursued,
than to the means which he employed for promot.

the impetuosity and imprudence with which he
carried them on. A queltion was moved by him
in the allembly, " whether the office of Bilhop, as
now exercised in the kingdom, were agreeable to
the word of God " In the ecclesiastical judica.
tories, continual complaints were made of the
Bihops for neglet of duty, many of which their
known remissness too well justified. The Biflop
of Dunkeld, being accused of dilapidating his
benefice, was found guilty by the assembly. The
Regent, instead of checking, connived at these
disputes about ecclesiastical government, as they
diverted the zeal of the Clergy from attending to
his daily encroachments on the patrimony of the
Church ".

The weight of the Regent's oppressive adminif- Is7s.
tration had, hitherto, fallen chiefly on those in H i"rriOft

common, were contrary to the letter of the law
Of these the Regent took advantage, and resolvcd
to found on them a charge of treason. This defigi
was revealed to the Earls by one of Morton'

exposed, compelled them to forget old quarrels
and to unite in a close confederacy, for thti
mutual defence. Their jundCion rendered ther
formidable; they despised the summons which th
Regent gave them to appear before a court c

to turn their eyes towards the young King, from

deeply disquieted with all the uneasy reflections
which accompany disappointed ambition, and intent
on fcbemes for recovering his former grandeur. Even
in this retreat, which the people called the Lion's-en,
his wealth and abilities rendered him formidable;
and the new Counsellors were so imprudent as to
rouse him, by the precipitancy with which they
hastened to strip him of all the remains of power.
They required him to surrender the castle of
Edinburgh, which was fill in his poffefion. He
refuted at firit to do so, and began to prepare for
its defence; but the citizens of Edinburgh having
taken arms, and repulsed part of the garrison,
which was sent out to guard a convoy of provi.
sIons, he was obliged to give up that important
fortress, without refitance. This encouraged hit
advcefaries to call a parliament to meet at Edin.
burgh, and to multiply their demands upon him,
in such a manner, as convinced him that nothing
kles than his utter ruin would latisfy their inve.
terate hatred.

already to decline. The Chancellor, the ablet

were either avowed Papists, or fufpeded of leaning
to theopinions of that sec. In an age, when the return
of popery was so much and fojuflly dreaded, this
gave universal alarm. As Morton had always
treated the Papists with rigor,this unseasonable favor
toperfonsofthat religion made all zealous Protestants
remember that circumstance in his administration
with great praise ".

Alorton, to whom none of there particulars were Rernme his

Having gained the confidence of the Earl of Mar,
and of the Countess his mother, he infinuatedto
them, that Alexander Erfkire had formed a plot to
deprive his nephew of the government of Stirling
cafile, and the custody of the King's person; and
easily induced an ambitious woman, and a youth of
twenty, to employ force to prevent this supposed
injury. The Earl repairing suddenly to Stirling, and
being admitted, as usual, into the castle with his
attendants, seized the gates early in the morning, and
turnedout his Uncle, who dreaded no danger from April ad
his hands. The soldiers of the garrison submitted to
him as their governor, and, with little danger and
noeffufion of blood, he became makler both of tho
bing's person, and of the fortress '.

3 o o K An event so unexpeded occasioned great con:

vi. Reernation Though Morton's hand did not appear
n7s. in the execution, he was universally believed to be

theauthor of the attempt. The new Counsellors saw
it to be necessary. for their own safety, to change
their measures, and, instead of pursuing him with
such implacaMle relentment, to enter into termsof
accommodation with an adversary, still focapable
of creating them trouble. Four were named, on each
fide, to adjust their differences. They met not far
from Dalkeith; and when they had brought matters

As the time appointed for the meeting of par.

him some anxiety. He was afraid of conducing
the young King to a city, whole inhabitants were
so much at the devotion- of the adverse fadtion.
He was no less unwilling to leave James behind
at Stirling. In order to avoid this dilemma,
he issued a proclamation, in the King's names

with an army five thousand strong; neither party,
however, was eager to engage. Morton diftruted
the fidelity of his own troops. The two Earls were
sensible that a single victory, however complete,
would not be decisive; and as they were in no
condition to undertake the siege of Stirling catle,
where the King was kept, their firength would
soon be exhausted, while Morton's own wealth,
and the patronage of the Queen of England, might

As soon as James assumed the government into his

own hands, he dispatched the Abbot of Dunferm.
ling to inform Elizabeth of that event; to offer to
renew the alliance between the two kingdoms; and

"Crawf. tlem. 0o7.

to demand poffeflion of the estate, which had lately B o o *
fallen to him by the death of his grandmother, the VI.
Countess of Lenox. That Lady's second son had 157'
left one daughter, Arabella Stewart, who was born
in England. And as the chief objection against the
pretensions of the Scottifli line to the Crown of
England, was that maxim of Englifli law, which
excludes aliens from any right of inheritance within
the kingdom, Elizabeth, by granting this demand,
would have established a precedent in James's
favor, that might have been deemed decisive,
with regard to a point, which it had been her
:onfiant care to keep undecided. Without susser.
ing this delicate question to be tried, or allowing
any new light to be thrown on that, which she
confidered as the great mystery of her reign, she
commanded Lord Burleigh, Master of the Wards,
to sequester the rents of the estate; and by this
method of proceeding, gave the Scottill King
early warning how necessary it would be to court
her favor, if ever he hoped for success in claims
of greater importance, but equally liable to be
controverted ".

After many delays, and with much difficulty, 57i.
the contending nobles were at lalt brought to
some agreement. But it was followed by a tragical
event. Morton, in token of reconcilement, having
invited the leaders of the opposite party to a great
entertainment, Athol the Chancellor was, foot April4.
after, taken ill, and died within a few days. The

' Camd. 461,

a o o x symptoms and violence of the disease gave rife to

VL strong suspicions of his being poisoned; and though
*s79* the pbyficians, who opened his body, differed in

opinion as to the cause of the distemper, the Cban.
cellor's relations publicly accused Morton of that
odious crime. The advantage which visibly accrued
to him, by the removal of a man of great abilities,
and averse from all his measures, was sufficient proof
of his guilt to the people, who are ever fond of
imputing the death of eminent persons to extra-
ordinary causes ".

Mott,, in The office of Chancellor was beltowed upon
'rpT' Ai Argyll, whom this preferment reconciled, in a

there passions into the mind of the young King. B o 0 K
A pretence was at hand to juRify the most violent vI.
proceedings. The pardon, Ripulated in the treaty 579
of Perth, did not extend to such as were accessary
to the murder of the Regents Murray or Lenox.
Lord John and his brother were suspected of being
the authors of both these crimes, and had been
included in a general act of attainder on that
account. Without summoning them to trial, or
examining a single witness to prove the charge,
this attainder was now thought sufficient to sub.
je& them to all the penalties which they would
have incurred by being formally convicted. The
Earls of Morton, Mar, and Eglinton, together
with the Lords Ruthven, Boyd, and Cathcart,
received a commillion to seize their persons and
efates. On a few hours warning, a considerable
body of troops was ready, and marched towards
Hamilton in hostile array. Happily the two brothers
made their escape, though with great difficulty.
But their lands were conficated; the castles of
Hamilton and Draffan besieged; those who de.
fended them punilhed. The Earl of Arran, though
incapable, from his situation, of committing any
crime, was involved, by a shameful abuse of law,
in the common ruin of his family; and as if he,'
too, could have been guilty of rebellion, he was
confined a close prisoner. These proceedings, so
contrary to the fundamental principles of justice,
were all ratified in the subsequent parliament "

Though Elizabeth had, at this time, no particular

reason to fear any attempt of the Popilh Princes
in Mary's favor, ibe till continued to guard her
with the fame anxious care. The acquisition of
Portugal, on the one hand, and the defence of the

by intefline commotions, and under a weak and
capricious Prince, despised and distrusted by his
own fubjeds, was in no condition to disturb its

He had weathered out one storm, had crufled his ,c,^n,.
adversaries, and was again in poffeflion of the sole
direction of affairs. But as the King was now of
an age when the character and dispositions of the
mind begin to unfold themselves, and to become
vifble, the smallest attention to these might have
convinced him, that there was reason to expec
new and more dangerous attacks on his power.
James early discovered that exceflive attachment
to favorites, which accompanied him through his
whole life. This paflion, which naturally arises
from inexperience, and youthful warmth of heart,
was, at his age, far from being culpable; nor
could it well be expected that the choice of the
objets, on whom he placed his affedions, Ihould
be made with great ckill. The most considerable
of them was Efme Stewart, a native of France,
and son of a second brother of the Earl of Lenox.
He was difringuilhed by the title of Lord D'Aubigne,
anellate in France, which descended to him from
his anccftors, on whom it had been conferred, in
reward of their valor and services to the French
Crown. He arrived in Scotland about this time, on sept. ,
purpofc to demand the eRate and title of Lenox, to
wihich he pretended a legal right. He was received,
at firl, by the King with the refped due to so

OO K near a relation. The gracefulness of his person;
VI. the elegance of his dress, and his courtly behavi,
157s. our, made a great impression on James, who, even

in his more mature years, was little able to reifil
there frivolous charms; and his affection flowed
with its usual rapidity and profusion. Within a
few days after Stewart's appearance at court, he
was created Lord Aberbrothock, soon after Earl,
and then Duke of Lenox, Governor of Dunbarton
castle, Captain of the guard, sirs Lord of the
bed-chamber, and Lord High Chamberlain. At
the fame time, and without any of the envy oa
emulation which is usual among candidates foi
favor, Captain James Stewart, the second son ol
Lord Ochiltree, grew into great confidence Bul
notwithlfanding this union, Lenox and Captain
Stewart were petfons of very opposite characers
The former was naturally gentle, humane, candid,
but unacquainted with the Rlate of the country,
and milled, or misinformed by those whom he
trusted; not unworthy to be the companion ol
the young King in his amusements, but utterly
disqualified for ading as a MiniRfer in directing his
affairs. The latter was remarkable for all the vice!
which render a man formidable to his country!

five pageants, according to the mode of that age.
Alter a long period of thirty seven years, during

arm:es, the nation rejoiced to fee the sceptre once
more in the hands of a King. Fond even of that fha.

B OO K These demonfirations, however, of the people's

VI. love and attachment to their Sovereign, encou.
i18o. raged the favorites to continue their insinuations

againIf Morton; and as the King now resided in
the palace of Holy-rood-houfe. to which all his
fubjeds had access, the cabal against the Earl grew
daily stronger, and the intrigue, which occasioned
his fall, ripened gradually.

Mmrtone.dea Morton began to be fcnfible of his danger, and
eo to pe- endeavoured to put a flop to the career of Lenox's

preferment, by representing him as a formidable
enemy to the Reformed religion, a secret agent
in favor of Popery, and a known emissary of the
house of Guise. I[he clergy, apt to believe every
rumor of this kind, spread the alarm among the
people. But Lenox, either out of complaisance to
his mailer, or convinced by the arguments of
some learned Divines, whom the King appointed
to infirud him in the principles of the Protefant
religion, publicly renounced the errors of Popery,
in the Church of St. Giles, and declared himself
a member of the Church of Scotland, by signing
her Confeflion of Faith. This, though it did not
remove all suspicions, nor silence some zealous
preachers, abated, in a great degree, the force of
the accusation ".

On the other hand, a rumor prevailed that

nlorton was preparing to seize the King's perfol,
and to carry him into England. Whether despair

lannot now be determined with certainty. As he
decllaed at his death that such a design had never
entered into his thoughts, the latter seems to be
moli probable. It afforded a pretence, however, for
reviving the office of Lord Chamberlain, which
had been for some time disused. That honor was
conferred on Lenox. Alexander Erskine, Morton's
capital enemy, was his deputy; they had under
them a band of gentlemen, who were appointed
conitantly to attend the King, and to guard his
person ".

Morton was not ignorant of what his enemies Elizabeth i.
intended to insinuate byfuch unusual precautions for 'erP",f'r i
the King's safety; and as his last resource, applied
to Elizabeth, whose protection had often flood him
in Itead in his greatest difficulties. In consequence
of this application, Bowes her Envoy accused Lenox
of practices against the peace of the two kingdoms,
and insisted, in her name, that he should instantly

to call in question the Envoy's powers, and upon
ihat pretence refused him farther audience; and

Sir Alexander Home was sent to expoltulate with

ingratitude towards a benefaarefs, who had placed
the Crown on'his head, and required him to advise

was worded with such scrupulous exatneLs, as
almolt screened him from any legal prosecution.
The murder of the late King was the only crime
which could not, with decency, be inserted in a

rate, if it led to power or to favor, entered the
council chamber while the King and nobles were
allembled, and falling on his knees, accused Morton
Dem. ;o. of being accefLiry, or according to the language of

the Scottifi law, art and pait, in the conspiracy
against the life of his MlajeRy's father, and offered,
under the usual penalties, to verify this charge by
legal evidence. Morton, who was present, heard
this accifation with tirmnefs; and replied with a
disdainful smile, proceeding either from contempt

of the infamous characer of his accuser, or from B o K
cofieintifnefs of his own innocence, " that his vi.
known zeal in punishing those who were fufpeO.ed sso.
of liat deteflable crime, might well exempt hinmelf
frlmn any suspicion of being accessary to it; never.
thelfs, lie would cheerfully submit to a trial,
either in that place, or in any other court; and
doubted not but his own innocence, and the malice
of his enemies, would then appear in the clearest
lieht." Stewart, who was still on his knees, began
to inquire how he would reconcile his bellowing
so many honors on Archibald Douglas, whom he
ccrtiinly knew to be one of the murderers, with
his pretended zeal againlt that crime. Morton was
ready to answer. But the King commanded both
to be removed. The Earl was confined, first of Isr.
all, to his own house, and then committed to the January .
ralfle of Edinburgh, of which Alexander Erikine
was Governor; and as if it had not been a sufficient
indignity to subjet him to the power of one of
his enemies, he was, soon after, carried to
Dunbarton, of which Lenox had the command.
A warrant was likewise issued for apprehending Jan. i,.
Archib:ld Douglas; but he, having received
timely intelligence of the approaching danger, fled

on horton fully convinced her that there was a
intention to sow the feeds of discord between th

Princess. Full of there apprehensions, she ordcre
a considerable body of troops to be assembled o

favoring that fuperfition. Not satisfied with having
mounted so fast to an uncommon height of power,
which he exercised with all the ralhnefs of youth,
and all the ignorance of a stranger; nor thinking
it enough to have deprived the Earl of Morton
of the authority due to his abilities and experience,
he had conspired the ruin of that nobleman, who
had often exposed his life in the King's cause,
who had contributed more than any other subjed

B o o x The greater solicitude Elizabeth discovered for

vi. Morton's safety, the more eagerly did his enemies
*151. drive on their schemes for his deRtrudion. Captain

Stewart, his accuser, was firRf appointed Tutor to
the Earl of Arran, and soon after both the title and
estate of his unhappy ward, to which he advanced
some frivolous claim, were conferred upon him.
The new-made Peer was commanded to conduit
Morton from Dunbarton to Edinburgh; and, by
that choice, the Earl was not only warned what
fate be might exped, but had the cruel mortification
of feeing his deadly enemy already loaded with
honors, in reward of the malice with which hc
bad contributed to his ruin.

Be h tred The records of the Court of JuJfciary at this
ud CB period are loft The account which our historians

give of Morton's trial is inaccurate and unfatif

have been carried on with violence. During the
trial, great bodies of armed men were drawn uS

employed the reft of his time in religious conferences,

with his conscience, and pressed his crimes home
upon him What he confessed with regard to the
crime for which he suffered, is remarkable, and
supplies, in some measure, the imperfecion of our
records. He acknowledged, that on his return from
England after the death of Rizio, Bothwell had
informed him of the conspiracy against the King,
which the Queen, as he told him, knew of and ap-
proved; that he solicited him to concur in the execu-
tion ofit, which, at that time, he absolutely declined;
that soon after, Bothwell himself, and Archibald

commanded these guards; and even in those moments,
when the most implacable hatred is apt torelent, the
malice of his enemies could not forbear this insult. Ohi
the scaffold, his behaviour was calm; his countenance
and voice unaltered; and after some time spent in
devotion, he suffered death with the intrepidity which
became the name of Douglas. His head was placed
on the public goal of Edinburgh; and his body, after
lying till fon-let on the scaffold, covered with a
beggarly cloak, was carried by common porters to

the laws of hospitality or of gratitude, carried on a
criminal intrigue with the wife of his benefactor, a
woman young and beautiful, but, according to the
description of a cotemporary Hiltorian, " intolerable
in all the imperfections incident to her sex." Impatient
of any restraint upon their mutual desires, they, with
equal ardor, wifled to avow their union publicly,
and to legitimate, by a marriage, the offspring of
their unlawful paflion. The Countess petitioned to
be divorced from her hulband, for a reason which
no modelt woman will ever plead. The judges,
over-awed by Arran, passed sentence without delay.
This infamous scene was concluded by a marriage, July A
solemnized with great pomp, and beheld by all ranks
of men with the utmost horror ".
A Parliament was held this year, at the open. oaob. *

and the Earl now created Duke of Lenox. Arran,
haughty by nature, and pufled on by his wife's
ambition, began to affect an equality with the
Duke, under whose protetion he had hitherto
been contented to place himself. After various
attempts to form a party in the council against
Lenox, he found him fixed so firmly in the

odious to the nation. During the continuance of
it, Arran affected to court the clergy, pretended
an extraordinary zeal for the Protestant religion, and
labored to confirm the suspicions, which were
enttrtained of his rival, as an emissary of the house
of Guise, and a favorer of Popery. As he was
supposed to be acquainted with the Duke's moR
secret designs, calumnies were litened to with
greater credit than was due to his character. To this
rivallhip between Lenox and Arran, during the
continuance of which, each endeavoured to conciliate
the good will of the clergy, we must ascribe several
acs of this parliament uncommonly favorable to the
Church, particularly one, which abolished the
practice, introduced by AMorton, of appointing but
one minister to several parifles.

EciEI.Ri No notice hath been taken for several years ol
ca ~ . EcclefiaRical affairs. While the civil government

underwent so many extraordinary revolutions, the
Church was not free from convulsions. Twt
objects, chiefly, engrossed the attention of the
Clergy. The one was the forming a system o
discipline, or Ecclesiastical polity. After loi'l
labor, and many difficulties, this system was a
last brought to some degree of perfcetion Th
Assembly solemnly approved of it, and appointc
it to be laid before the Privy Council. in order t4
obtain the ratification of it in Parliament. Bu

\Morton, during his adminiflration, and those who, n o o K
after his fall, governed the King, were equally vl.
unwilling to fee it carried into execution; and by s115
farting difficulties, and throwing in objecions,
prevented it from receiving a legal fandion. The
othtr point in view was the abolition of the
Epifcop.il order. The Bilhops were so devoted to
the King, to whom they owed their promotion,
that the fundtion itself was by some reckoned
dangerous to civil liberty. Being allowed a feat in
Parliament, and diftinguilhed by titles of honor,
these not only occasioned many avocations from
theirfpititual employments, but soon rendered their
charader and manners extremely different from those
of the Clergy in that age. The nobles viewed their
power with jealousy; the populace confidered their
lives as profane, and both wilhed their downfal
with equal ardor. The personal emulation between
Melvil and Adamson, a man of learning, and
eminent for his popular eloquence, who was promot-
ed, on the death of Douglas, to be Archbilhop of
St. Andrew's, mingled itself with the paflions on
each fide, and heightened them. Attacks were made,
in every assembly, on the order of Bilhops; their
privileges were gradually circumscribed; and at
lift an at was passed, declaring the office of
Bilhops, at it was then exercised within the realm,
to have neither foundation nor warrant in the
word of God; and requiring, under pain of ex-
communication, all who now possessed that office,

vl. The court did not acquiesce in this decree. A
s15L. vacancy happening soon after in the fee of Glasgow,

M-ontgomtry miniler at Stirling, a man vain,
fickle, presumptuous, and more apt, by the
blemilbes in his character, to have alienated the
people from an order already beloved, than to
reconcile them to one which was the objet of their
hatred, made an infamous fimoniacal bargain with
Lenox, and on his recommendation was chosen
Archbilhop. The Prelbytery of Stirling, of
which he was a member, the Prelbytery of Glasgow,
whither he was to be translated, the General As
fembly, vied with each other in prosecuting him
. on that account. In order to screen Montgomery,

James made trial both of gentle and of rigorous
mneaures, and both were equally ineffectual. The
General Assembly was jult ready to pronounce
againRf him the sentence of excommunication, when
a Herald enteted, and commanded them, in the
King's name, and under pain of rebellion, to flop
further proceedings. Even this injundion they
despised; and though Montgomery, by his tears,
and seeming penitence, procured a flort respite,
the sentence was at last issued by their appointment,
and publilhed in all the churches throughout the
kingdom.

The firmnef. of the Clergy in a collective body was

not greater than the boldnef. of some individu
als, particularly of the Ministers of Edinburgh.
They inveighed daily against the corrupuons
in the adminifration, and, with the freedom

of

of speech admitted into the pulpit in that age, B o

named Lenox and Arran as the chief authors of vi.
the griesatces under which the church and kingdom 1s8a.
grodned. T'he courtiers, in their turn, complained
to the King of the insolent and seditious spirit of
the Clergy. In order to check the boldness of their
discourses, James ilfued a proclamation, command.

catories of this encroachment upon the immunities
of his office. They approved of the docrine which
he had delivered; and he determined to disregard
the royal proclamation. But the magistrates being
determined to compel him to leave the city, accord.
ing to the King's orders, he was obliged to abandon
his charge, after protesting publicly, at the cross
of Edinburgh, againf the violence which was put
upon him. The people accompanied him to the
gates with tears and lamentations; and the Clergy
denounced the vengeance of Heaven against the
authors of this outrage ",

In this perilous situation stood the Church; the
authority of its judicatories called in question, and
the liberty of the pulpit refrained, when a suddea
revolution of the civil government procured them
unexpected relief.

B OO James usually resided at Dalkeith, or Kinneil, the

VI. feats of Lenox and of Arran, and was attended by
5s8:. such company, and employed in such amusements,

as did not suit his dignity. The services of those
who had contributed molt to place the Crown on
his head, were but little remembered. Many who
had opposed him with the greatest virulence
enjoyed the rewards and honors to which the
others were entitled. Exalted notions of regal
prerogative, utterly inconsistent with the conRfitu
tion of Scotland, being inltilled by his favorite
into the mind of the young Monarch, unfortun
ately made, at that early age, a deep impreffio;
there, and became the source of almolR all hi
subsequent errors in the government of both king
doms ". Courts of juRfice were held in almost ever
county, the proprietors of land were called befon
them, and upon the slightest negled of any of thi
numerous forms, which are peculiar to feudal hold
ings, they were fined with unusual and intolerabli
rigor. The Lord Chamberlain revived the obfolet
jurifdidion of his office over the Boroughs, ant
they were fubjeded to exactions no less grievous

Elizabeth, who, during the administration of
the four Regents, had the entire direction of the
affairs of Scotland, felt herself deprived of all
influence in that kingdom ever since the death
of Morton, and was ready to countenance any
attempt to rescue the King out of the hands of
favorites, who were leading him into measures so
repugnant to all her views. The Earls of Mar
and Glencairn, Lord Ruthven, lately created
Earl of Gowrie, Lord Lindsay, Lord Boyd, the
Tutor of Glamis, the eldest son of Lord Oliphant,
with several Barons and gentlemen of diftintion,
entered into a combination for that purpose; and
as changes in adminifRration , which, among
polilhed nations, are brought about slowly and
silently, by artifice and intrigue, were in that
rude age effeced suddenly and by violence, the
King's situation, and the security of the favorites,
encouraged the confpiraors to have immediate
recourse to force.

gave him some uneasiness; and as those who were
in the secret arrived every moment from different
parts, the appearance of so many new faces increaf.

ever, with the utmost care; and next morning
prepared for the field, expecting to find there some
opportunity of making his escape. But jull as he
was ready to depart, the Nobles entered his bed.

the illegal and oppreflive actions of his two favori.

enemies to the religion and liberties of the nation.
James, though he received this remonstrance with
the complaisance which was necessary in his present
situation, was extremely impatient to be gone; but
as he approached the door of his apartment, the
Tutor of Glamis rudely flopped him. The Kimg
complained, expoftulated, threatened, and finding
all these without effec, burfi into tears: " Ne

Lenox and Arran were aftonilhed to the lalt Commit
decree at an event so unexpected, and so fatal to Arran
their power. The former endeavoured, but without
success, to excite the inhabitants; of Edinburgh to
take arms in order to refcuc their Sovereign from
captivity. The latter, with his usual impetuosity,
mounted on horseback the moment he heard what
had befallen the King, and with a few followers,
rode towards Ruthven catle; and as a considerable
body of the conrpirators, under the command of
thc Earl of Mar, lay in his way ready to.oppofe
him, he separated himself from his companions, and
with two attendants arrived at the gate of the castle.

by violence, and no less disagreeable to James,
than it was rigorous with regard to himself. But
the power of his enemies, who were maflers of
the King's person, who were secretly supported by
Elizabeth, and openly applauded by the Clergy,
deterred him from any enterprise, the success of
which was dubious, and the danger certain, both

On the other hand, the conspirators were ex. Their con-
tremely solicitous not only to secure the approbation duct ap"rov.
of their countrymen , but to obtain some legal Assembly a
fandion of their enterprise. For this purpose they aconventios
publihled a long declaration, containing the motives of
which had induced them to venture on such an
irregular Rep, and endeavoured to heighten the
public indignation against the favorites, by repre-
senting, in the strongest colors, their inexperience
and insolence, their contempt of the nobles, their
violation of the privileges of the Church, and their
oppreflion of the people. They obliged the King,
who could not with safety refuse any of their
demands, to grant them a remilfion in the most
ample form; and not satisfied with that, they ap.
plied to the Assembly of the Church, and easily
procured an ad, declaring, " that they had done Oct. .
good and acceptable service to God, to their Sover-
eign, and to their native country;" and requiring
all sincere Protestants to concur with them in carry-
ing forward such a laudable enterprise. In order to
add the greater weight to this ac, every Minister
was enjoined to read it, in hisown pulpit, and to
inflict the censures of the Church on those who set
themselves in opposition to so good a cause. A
Convention of estates assembled a few days after,
palled an ad to the fame effect, and granted full

a restraint no less ftrit than at the firR moment
when he was seized by the conspirators. Lenox,
after eluding many commands to depart out of the
kingdom, was at las obliged to begin his journey.
He lingered, however, for some time, in the neigh.

to make some effort towards restoring the King to
liberty. But either from the gentleness of his own
disposition, averse to bloodibed and the disorders
of civil war, or from some other cause unknown

Soon after his arrival in France, the fatigue of the
journey, or the anguilh of his mind, threw him
into a fever. In his last moments he discovered
such a firm adherence to the Proteflant faith, as
fully vindicates his memory from the imputation ol
an attachment to Popery, with which he had been
uncharitably loaded in Scoland ". As he wai
the earliest, and belt beloved, he was, perhaps,

the mot deserving, though not the moR able, of all iB o OK
Jlaes'S favorites. The warmth and tenderness of his VI.
ilalter's affeition for him was not abated by death i8e.
iifclf. By many adCs of kindness and genernfity
towards his poflerity, the King not only did great
honor to the memory of Lenox, but let his own
charader in one of its most favorable points of view.

The success of the conspiracy, which deprived Mairy'
James of liberty, made great noise over all Eu :iebt^,

experience had taught her what injuries a captive
Prince is exposed to susser; and as many of those
who were now concerned in the enterprise against

fidered as the chief authors of her own misfortunes,
it was natural for the tenderness of a mother to
apprehend that the fame calamities were ready to
fall on his head; and such a profpec did not fail
of adding to the distress and horror of her own
situation. In the anguish of her heart, she wrote
tn Elizabeth, complaining in the bitterest terms

self had been treated, and beseeching her not to
abandon her son to the mercy of his rebellious

B 0 0 K But it was illadapted to gain the end Tfe had inview,

VL and accordingly it neither procured any mitigation

of the rigor of her own confinement, nor any inter.
position in favor of the King ".

Ins: Henry IIL who, though he feared and hated the
mbai&s Princes of Guise, was often obliged to court their
So Fruce favor, interposed with warmth, in order to extricate
i 'L. James out of the hands of a party so entirely devoted

to the Englilh interest. He commanded M. de la
Motte Fenelon, his ambalfador at the court
of England, to repair to Edinburgh, and to
contribute his utmost endeavours towards placing
James in a situation more suitable to his dignity.
As Elizabeth could not, with decency, refuse him
liberty to execute this commiflion, The appointed
Davison to attend him into Scotland as her Envoy,
under color of concurring with him in the negocia.
tion, but in reality to be a spy upon his motions,
and to obftrut his success. James, whole title to the
Crown had not hitherto been recognised by any ol
the Princes on the continent, was extremely fond
of such an honorable embassy from the French
Monarch; and, on that account, as well as for the
fake of the errand on which he came, received Fe
Ta.?. nelon with great refpet. The nobles, in whose

power the King was, did not relish this interposition
of the French court, which had long loft its ancient
influence over the affairs of Scotland. The Clergy
were alarmed at the danger to which religion
would be exposed, if the Princes of Guile lhould

" Camd. 489

'rhough the King tried every method for restraining vl.
them within the bountd( of decency, they declaimed I1s3.
ag:linft the court of France, against the Princes of
Guise, againf the ,mbaffador, against entering into
any alliance with such notorious persecutors of the
Church of God, with a vehemence which no regular
government would now tolerate, but which was
then extremely common. The Ambaffjdor, watched
by Davison, distrusted by the nobles, and exposed
to the infilts of the Clergy and of the people, returned
into England without procuring any change in the
King's situation, or receiving any answer to a
proposal which he made, that the government Ihould
be carried on in the joint names of James and the
Queen his mother ".

Meanwhile, James, though he dissembled with Jame et.
great art, became every day more uneasy under his capei ot,
confinement; his uneasiness rendered him continually of the con.
attentive to find out a proper opportunity for making flpi'tor"
bisefcape; and to this attention he at last owed his
liberty, which the King of France was not able, nor
the(2ueen of England willing, to procure for him.
As the conspirators had forced Lenox out of the king-
dom, and kept Arran at a distance from court, they
grew secure; and imagining that time had reconciled
the King to them, and to his situation, they watched
him with little care. Some occasions ofdifcord had
anfen among themselves; and the French Ambassador,

That he might not create any suspicion, he lodged

but pretending a curiosity to fee the castle, no sooner
was he entered with some of his attendants whom
he could truR, than Colonel Stewart commanded
the gates to be shut, and excluded all the reft of his
train. Next morning the Earls of Argyll, Huntly,
Crawford, Montrose, Rothes, with others to whom
the secret had been communicated, entered the
town with their fo!lowers; and though Mar, with
several of the leaders of the faction, appeared in
arms, they found themselves so far out-numbered,
that it was in vain to think of recovering poffci
sion of the King's person, which had been in their
power somewhat longer than ten months. James
was naturally of so soft and ductile a temper, that
those who were near his person commonly made a
deep impression on his heart, which was formed to
be under the sway of favorites. As he remained
implacable and unreconciled to the conspirators,
during so long a time, and at a period of life when

person and authority filled him, must have been

His joy at his escape was youthful and excessive. Rersivr,
He resolved, however, by the advice of Sir James hw v.r, to
A\lelvil, and his wisest counfel!'ri, to aft with the w;th modera
utnmot moderation. Having called into his presence tiJ'
the leaders of both factions, the neighbouring gentry,
the deputies of the adjacent boroughs, the Ministers,
and the heads of colleges, he declared, that although
he had been held under retlraint for some time by
violence, he would not impute that as a crime to any
man, but, without remembering the irregularities
which had been so frequent during his minority,
would pals a general ac of oblivion, and govern all
his fubjeets with undiflinguilhing and equal assec-
tion. As an evidence of his sincerity he visited the
Earl of Gowrie at Ruthven castle, and granted him
a full pardon of any guilt he had contracted, by
the crime committed in that very place,"'.

But James did not adhere long to this prudent But Arran
and moderate plan. His former f.vorite, ..,e Earl ,endiht"is
of Arran, had been permitted for frme time to over him,
reside at Kinneil, one of his country feats. As soon
as the King felt himself at liberty. his love for
him began to revive, and he expressed a strong
desire to fee him. The courtiers violently opposed

a becoming dignity, replied, that promises extorted
by violence, and conditions yielded out of fear, were
no longer binding, when these were removed; that
itbelonged to him alone to chufe what ministers he
would employ in his service; and that though he
resolved to treat the conspirators at Ruthven with
the utmost clemency, it was necessary, for the sup-
port of his authority, that such an insult on his
person thould not pass altogether uncenfured "'.

against them. As they had all refused to accept
of pardon upon the terms which he had offered,
they were required, by a new proclamation,
to surrender thenfelves prisoners. The Earl of

The conspirators, though far from having done
any thing that was unconimon in a barbarous age,

ft.le of government, must be acknowledged to
hlue been guilty of an ad of treason against their
Sovereign; and James, who confidered their con.

clemency, when he offered to pardon them upon
their confessing their crime. But, on the other hand,
it must be allowed that, after the King's voluntary
promise of a general oblivion, they had some reason
to compli.ni of breach of faith, and, without the
most unpardonable imprudence, could not have
put their lives in Arran's power.

00 t procees for that purpose, than to their own wan,

lv of zeal, that they did not deprive, and perhaps
'3s excommunicate all the Bishops in Scotland. When

the King recovered his liberty, things put on a
very different asped. The favor bestowed upon
Arran, the enemy of every thing decent and sacred,
and the rigorous prosecution of those nobles who
had been the mos zealous defenders of the Protelt
ant cause, were confidered as sure presages of
the approaching ruin of the Church. The Clergy
could not conceal their apprehensions, nor view
this impending danger in silence. Dury, who had
been refored to his office as one of the Miniflen
of Edinburgh, openly applauded the Raid of Ruth
,vn in the pulpit, at which the King was to enraged,
that, notwithltanding some symptoms of his sub.
million, he commanded him to resign his charge
in the city. Mr. Andrew Melvil, being funmoned
before the Privy Council to answer for the dorine
which he had uttered in a sermon at St. Andrew's,
and accused of comparing the present grievances
of the nation with those under James 11I. and ol
intimating obliquely that they ought to be redressed
in the fame manner, thought it incumbent on him
to behave with greater firmness. He declined the
jurisdiction of a Civil court, in a cause which
he maintained to be purely Ecclesiastical; the
Pretbytery, of which he was a member, had, as
he contended, the sole right to call him to account
for words spoken in the pulpit; and neither the
King nor council could judge, in the firt inltance,
of the dotrine delivered by Preachers, without

violating the immunities of the Church. This B o O X
cx,,ipion from civil jurifdlition was a privilege vl.

been admitted, the Proteft.nt cirrgy would have
become independent on the civil Mlagiftrate; and
an orller of men extremely ufcful to society while
they inculcate those duties which tend to promote
it, happiness and tranquillity, might have become
no lesS pernicious, by teaching, without fear or
control, the mofl dangerous principles, or by
exciting their hearers to the most desperate and
lawless adions. The King, jealous to excess of his
prerogative, was alarmed at this daring encroach.
ment on it; and as Melvil, by his learning and
zeal, had acquired the reputation and authority of
head of the party, he resolved to punilh him with
the rigor which that pre-eminence rendered necef-
iry, and to discourage, by a timely severity, the
revival of such a dangerous claim. Mlvil, however,
avoided his rage, by flying into England; and the
pulpits rcfoundrd with complaints that the King hadc
extinuiilied the light of learning in the kingdom,
and d'prived the Church of the ablest and molt
faithful guardian of its liberties and discipline"'.

from the King's neglcd, and the haughtinets o

land, and to reside in France. While he waited a
Dundee for an opportunity to embark, he was
informed that the Earls of Angus, Mar, and the
Tutor of Glamis, had concerted a scheme for
surprising the castle of Stirling. In his situation
little perfualion was necelfary to draw him to
engage in it. Under various pretexts, he put of
his voyage, and lay ready to take arms on the day
fixed by the conspirators for the execution of their
enterprise. His lingering so long at Dundee, with
out any apparent reason, awakened the suspicion
of the court, proved fatal to himself, and difap
pointed the success of the conspiracy. Colone
William Stewart surrounded the house where he
lodged with a body of soldiers, and, in spite o
his refitance, took him prisoner. Two days after
Angus, Ml1ar, and Glamis, seized the castle o
Stirling, and erecting their standard there, publihed
a manifesto, declaring that they took arms for no
other reason but to remove from the King's pefeonc

a minion who had acquired power by the molt B oO t
unworthy actions, and who exercised it with the VI.
moR nmtolerible insolence. The account ofGowrie's 1584.
imprisonment firuck a damp upon their spirits. They
imputed it to treachery on his part, and suspeCted,
that as he had formerly deserted, he had now
betrayed them. At the fame time, Elizabeth having
negleded to supply them, in due time, with a fum
of money, which she had promised to them, and
their friends and vaIfals coming in slowly, they
appeared irresolute and disheartened; and as the
King, who adted with great vigor, advanced to-
wards them at the head of twenty thousand men,
they fled precipitately towards England, and with
dliliculty made their escape ". This ralh and feeble
attempt produced such effects as usually follow
disappointed conspiracies. It not only hurt the cause
for which it was undertaken, but added strength
and reputation to the King; confirmed Arran's
power; and enabled them to pursue their measures
with more boldness, and greater success. Gowrie
was the firRf vidim of their resentment. After a
very informal trial, a jury of Peers found him guilty
of treason, and he was publicly beheaded at Stirling.

Rtep. But as it became necessary, for this purpose, APa'rliament
to call in the aid of the legislative authority, a
Parliament was hastily summoned: and while so

exemption from the authority of the civil courts;
the attempting to diminilh the rights and privileges
of any of the three estates in parliament, were de.
dared to be high treason. The holding assemblies,

ae.inft them, in the name of his brethren, because Vl.
they had been passed without the knowledge or 'sq.

the pulpits and ecclesiastical judicatories had both
beet elteemed sacred. In the former, the Clergy
had been accustomed to censure, and admonilh with
unbounded liberty. In the latter, they exercised
an uncontrouled and independent jurifdiaion. The
blow was now aimed at both these privileges. These
new statutes were calculated to render churchmen
as inconsiderable as they were indigent; and as the
avarice of the nobles had stripped them of the wealth,
the King's ambition was about to deprive them
of the power which once belonged to their order.
No wonder the alarm was universal, and the com.
plaints loud. All the Ministers of Edinburgh for.
sook their charge, and fled into England. The
most eminent Clergymen throughout the kingdom
imitated their example. Desolation and aftonilhment
appeared in every part of the Scottish Church; the
people bewailed the loss of Pallors, whom they
efleemed; and full of conflernation at an event so
unexpedled, openly expressed their rage againfl
Arran, and began to fufpetd the King himself to

Bo o K W HTLE Scotland was toro by inteltine fadions,

vn1. Elizabeth was alarmed with the rumor of a projeei
's54. in agitation for fettirg Mary at liberty. Francis

t'isrofp. Trokmorton, a Chelhire gentleman, was fufpeded
ac agaft of being deeply concerned in the defigo, and on
Elixkc. that suspicion he was taken into custody. Among

his papers were found two lifts, one of the prin.
cipal harbours in the kingdom, with an account
of their situation, and of the depth of water in
each; the other, of all the eminent Roman Catho.
lics in England. This circumstance confirmed the
suspicion againfl him, and some dark and desperate
conspiracy was supposed just ready to break out
At firt he boldly avowed his innocence, and
declared that the two papers were forged by the
Queen's Aliniflers, in order to intimidate or insnare
him ; and he even endured the ralk with the
utmcft fortitude. But being brought a second
time to the place of torture, his resolution failed

him, and he not only acknowledged that he had B o o t
held a secret correspondence with the Queen of vii.
Scots, but discovered a design that was formed 1584
to invade England. The Duke of Guise, he said,
undertook to furnilh troops, and to conduct
the enterprise. The Pope and King of Spain
were to supply the money necessary for carrying
it on; all the Englilh exiles were eager to take
arms; many of the Catholics at home would be
ready to join them at their landing; Mendoza,
the Spanish Ambassador, who was the life of the
conpiracy, spared no pains in fomenting the spirit
of dfaffedion among the English, or in haflening
the preparations on the Continent; and by his
command, he made the two liss, the copies whereof
had been found in his poffeflion. This confeflion
he retraded at his trial; returned to it again after
sentence was pafled upon him; and retracted it
once more at the place of execution '.

To us in the prefcnt age, who are alifted in
forming our opinion of this matter by the light
which time and history have thrown upon the
designs and characters of the Princes of Guise,
many circumstances of Throkmorton's confelcion
appear to be extremely remote from truth, or
even from probability. The Duke of Guise was,
at that juncture, far from being in a situation to
undertake foreign conquests. Without either power
or otfice at court; hated by the King, and perse-
culed by the favorites, he had no leisure for any

thinking it enough that one Pope had threatened
her with the sentence of excommunication, and
another had adually pronounced it, they now
began to disperse books and writings, in which
they endeavoured to persuade their disciples, that
it would be a meritorious adion to take away
her life; they openly exhorted the maids of honor
to treat her as Judith did Holofernes, and, by
such an illustrious deed, to render their own names

in no danger of being attacked within 'the island,
she determined to use her utmost efforts, in order
to recover that influence over the Scottilh councils,
which The had for some time entirely loft.

There were three different methods, by which She ende.
Elizabeth might hope to accomplish this; either Yurs to ae.
by furnilhing such effedual aid to the banilhed .ibiutjCe li
nobles, as would enable them to resume the chief Scotland.
direction of affairs; or by entering into such a aby gra'n
treaty with Mary, as might intimidate her son,
who being now accustomed to govern, would be
apt to agree to any terms rather than resign the
sceptre, or admit an associate in the throne; or by
gaining the Earl of Arran, to secure the diredion
of the King his mailer. The lafi was not only
the easiest and fpeedieft, but moR likely to be
fuccefful. T'his Elizabeth resolved to pursue; but
without laying the other two altogether aside.
With this view The sent Davison, one of her
principal secretaries, a-man of abilities and address,
into Scotland. A Minister so venal as Arran, hated
by his own countrymen, and holding his power
by the most precarious of all tenures, the favor
of a young Prince, accepted Elizabeth's offers
without hesitation, and deemed the acquisition of
er protecion to be the most solid foundation of
his own greatness. Soon after he consented to an Angut. ;3.
Interview with Lord Hunfdon the Governor of
Brwick, and being honored with the pompous

B O O K title of Lieutenant General for the King, he appealed

vii. at the place appointed with a splendid train. In
'(s4- Hun;don'. presence he renewed his promises of an

inviolable and faithful attachment to the Englifl
interest. and assured him that James Ihould enter into
no negociation which might tend to interrupt the
peace between the two kingdoms; and as Elizabet
began to entertain the fame fears and jealousies con.
cerning the King's marriage, which' had formerly
disquieted her with regard to his mother's, he under
took to prevent James from listening to any over.
ture of that kind, until he had previously obtained
the Queen of Plngland's consent '.

Scme o. The banilbed Lords and their adherents soon feli
^a.A t* n the effedts of Arran's friendship with England. Ai
ba.isd Elizabeth had permitted them to take refuge in her
Lot. dominions, and several of her Ministers were ol

opinion that The ought to employ her arms in defenc
of their cause, the fear of this was the only thing
which reitrained James and his favorite, from pro
ceeding to such extremities againlt them, as might
have excited the pity or indignation of the Englil,
and have prompted them to exert themselves with
Apl. :L. vigor in their behalf. But every apprebenion of this

kind being now removed, they ventured to call
parliament, in which an ad was passed, attainting
Angus, Mar, Glamis, and a great number of thei
followers. Their etates devolved to the Crown
and according to the practice of the Scottilb Mo
narchs, who were obliged to reward the fadio

orel.lved or corrupted by the Court, yielded obe-

were fcqueftered, some of the more active com-
mitred to pFlfon, and numbers compelled to fly the
klngdomn. I lose who complied, fell under the
suspicion of acting from mercenary or ambitious
notlies. Those who fufflred acquired high reputa.
tion, by giving such convincing evidence of their
firmnef and sincerity. The judicatories of the
Church were almost entirely fuppreflfd. In some
places, scarce as many Ministers remained, as to
perform the duties of religious worship; they soon
funk in reputation among the people, and being pro.
hibited not only from difcourfng of public affairs,
but obliged, by the jealousy of the administration,
to frame every sentiment and expression in such a
manner, as to give the court no offence, their sermons
were deemed languid, insipid, and contemptible;
and it became the general opinion, that together
with the molt virtuous of the nobles, and the molf
faithful of the Clergy, the power and vigor of re.
ligion were now banilhed out of the kingdom '.

o o t Meanwhile, Elizabeth was carrying on one ofthofe
vii. fruitless negociations with the Queen of Scots, which
S'1 it had become almost matter of form to renew every

year. They served not only to amtife that unhappy
Princess with some profped of liberty; but furnisled
an apology for eluding the solicitations of foreign
powers in her behalf; and were of use to overawe
James, by fbowing him that Ihe could, at any time,
set free a dangerous rival to dispute his authority.
These treaties The suffered to proceed to what length
he pleased, and never wanted a pretence for breaking
them off, when they became no longer necelfary. The
treaty now on foot was not, perhaps, more sincere
than many which preceded it; the reasons, how.
ever, which rendered it ineffehual were far from
being frivolous.

eormo . As Crichton a Jesuit was failing from Slanders
{s*psS E towards Scotland, the hIip on board of which he
rsat. was a pafenger happened to be chased by pirates,

who, in that age, often infested the narrow seas.
Crichton, in great confusion, tore in pieces some
papers in his custody, and threw them away; but,
by a very extraordinary accident, the wind blew
them back into the bhip, and they were immedi.
ately taken up by rome of the passengers, who
carried them to Wade, the Clerk of the privy
council. He, with great industry and patince,
joined them together, and they were found to
contain the account of a plot said to have been
formed by the King of Spain, and the Duke of Guise,
for invading England. The people were not yet
recovered from the fear and anxiety occasioned by

the conspiracy in which Throkmorton had been B o o K
egaged, and as his discoveries appeared now to he 1:.
connrmed by additional evidence, not only all their '118
former apprehenlions recurred, but the conflerna.
tion became general and exctffive. As all the din.
ger, with which England had been threatened for
some years, flowed either immediately from Mary
herrelf, or from such as made use of her name to
junify infurrecdions and conspiracies, this gradually
dimmniln:d the compassion due to her situation, and
the Engliil, instead of pitying, began to fear and to
hate her. Elizabeth, under whole wife and pacific
reign the English enjoyed tranquillity, and had
opened sources of wealth unknown to their ancestors,
was extremely beloved by all her people; and re-
gard to her safety, not less than to their own in-
terest, animated them against the Scottifli Queen.
In order to discourage her adherents, it was Ocaoli,,
thought necessary to convince them, by some tio, .n'..
public deed, of the attachment of the Englilh to rotion to
their own Sovereign, and that any attempt against lar
her life would prove fatal to her rival. With this
view, an Association was framed, the fubcribers of October ts.
which bound themselves by the mot solemn oaths,
to defend the Queen against all her enemies,
"foreign and domestic; and if violence Ihould

hbe offered to her life, in order to favor the
'title of any pretender to the Crown, they not
only engaged never to allow or acknowledge
'the person or persons by whom, or for whom,
'such a detestable adt hould be committed, but
'vowed, in the presence of the eternal God, to

r n n a prosecute such person orperfons to the death, and
TVI. " topurfue them, with their utmot vengeance, to
15a4. " their utter overthrow and extirpation '." Persons

of all ranks subscribed this combination with the
greatef eagernets and unanimity '.

wlicd Mary confidered this combination, not only as
md t- an avowed design to exclude her from all right of

succession, but as the certain and immediate fore.
runner of her deflrucion. In order to avert tbis, lbe
made such feeble efforts as were fill in her power,
and sent NauC her secretary to court, with offers of
more entire resignation to the will of Elizabeth, in
every point, which had been the occasion of their
long enmity, than all her sufferings hitherto bad been
abletoextort'. But whether Mary adhered inflexibly
to her privileges as an independent Sovereign, or
yielding to the neceflity of her situation, endeavour.
ed, by concelions, to sooth her rival, ae was
equally unfuccefiful. Her firmnces was imputed to
obstinacy, or to the secret hope of foreign aflitance;
her conceflions were either believed to be insincere,
or to flow from the fear of some imminent danger.
Her present willingness, however, to comply with
any terms was so great, that Walsingham warmly
urged his miitrefs to come to a final agreement
with her'. But Elizabeth was persuaded, thatit
was the spirit raised by the association which had
rendered her so paflive and compliant. She always
imagined that there was something mysterious

and deceitful in all Mary's adions, and fufpeded a o o
her of carrying on a dangerous corr(fpondence with vii.
the Englilh Catholics, both within and without the Is*4
kingdom. Nor were her suspicions altogether void
of foundation. Mary had, about this time, writ-
tell a letter to Sir Francis Inglefield, urging him to
haifen the execution of what (he calls the Gicatplotor
pDfqnment, without hesitating on account of any
danger in which it might involve herlife, which ibe
would most willingly part with, if, by that sacrifice,
Ihe could procure relief for so great a number of the
opprefled children of the Church '. Inftead,:therefore, - she is treat

B OOK K he appointed the MaRer of Gray his Ambassador

Vl!. to the court of England, and intrusted him with the
its. conduct of a negociation for that purpose. For this

honor he was indebted to the envy and jealousy
of the Earl of Arran. Gray possessed all-the talents
of a Courtier; a graceful person, an insinuating
address, boundless ambition, and a refRlef and
intriguing spirit. During his residence in France,
he had been admitted into the most intimate fami.
liarity with the Duke of Guise, and, in order to
gain his favor, had renounced the Protestant Reli.
gion, and professed the utmost zeal for the captive
Queen, who carried on a secret correspondence
with him, from which the expeded great advan.
ages. On his return into Scotland, he paid court to
James with extraordinary assiduity, and his acconm
pli/hments did not fail to make their usual impreflion
on the King's heart. Arran, who had introduced
him, began quickly to dread his growing favor;
and flattering himself, that absence would efface
any sentiments of tenderness from the mind of a
young Prince, pointed him out, by his malicious
praises, as the most proper person in the kingdom,
for an embassy of such importance; and contributed
to raise him to that high dignity, in order to haltea
his fall. Elizabeth, who had an admirable dexterity
in discovering the proper instruments for carrying
on her designs, endeavoured, by caresses, and by
presents, to secure Gray to her interest The former
flattered his vanity, which was great; the latter
supplied his profuseness, which was till greater
He abandoned himself without reserve to Elizabeth's

direction, and not only undertook to retain the B OOK
Kim;l under the influence of England, but ated as vil.
a spy upon the Scottihf Queen, and betrayed to "ts.4
her rival every secret that he could draw from her
by his high pretensions of zeal in her service ".

Gray's credit with the Englilh court was ex. Uis intrrct

tremely galling to the banished nobles. Elizabeth no wVth ,t,
longer thought of employing her power to restore Englijd.
thet; ie found it easier to govern Scotland by
corrupting the King's favorites; and, in compliance
with Gray's solicitations, hfe commanded the exiles Decetl. it.
to leave the north of England, and to remove into
the heart of the kingdom. This rendered it difficult
tor them to hold any correspondence with their
partifins in Scotland, and almotf impoflible to
rctur thither without her permiflion. Gray, by
gaii:ing a point which James had so much at heart,
rin'tted himself more firmly than ever in his favor;
and by acquiring greater reputation, became capa-

natural arrogance, and rendered it intolerable. He
was no longer content with the condition of a

Murdo Duke of Albany; and boasted, openly, that
his title to the Crown was preferable to that of
the King himself. But, together with these thoughts
of royalty, he retained the meanness suitable to

he was unwilling to part with some lands adjacent
to one of Arran's ellates; and the third, for refuting

the whole country, and intruded themselves into
every company. The nearest neighbours distrusted
and feared each other. All familiar society was at
an end. Even the common intercourses of humanity
were interrupted, no man knowing in whom to

one of the banilhed Lords, about private business,
were condemned and put to death, for holding
correspondence with rebels. Cunninghame of
Drumwhafel, and Douglas Mains, two gentlemen
of honor and reputation, were accused of having
conspired, with the exiled nobles, to seize the
King's person. A single witness only appeared; the
evidence they produced of their innocence was
unanswerable; their accuser himself not long after
acknowledged that he had been suborned by Arran;
and all men believed the charge against them to be

ing, and suffered the death of traitors".

P.m'co.rpi. About the fame time that these gentlemen were
,.,'^,a punilhed for a pretended conspiracy, Elizabeth's

life was endangered by a real one. Parry, a Dodor
of laws, and a Member of the House of Commons,
a man vain and fantastic, but of a resolute spirit,
had lately been reconciled to the Church of Rome;
and fraught with the zeal of a new convert, he
offered to demonfirate the sincerity of his attach.
ment to the religion which he had embraced, by
killing Elizabeth. Cardinal Allen had publilied a
book, to prove the murder of an excommunicated
Prince to be not only lawful, but a meritorious
adion. The Pope's Nuncio at Venice, the Jesuits
both there and at Paris, the Engli(h exiles, all

him to persevere; and grantd him, for his encou- vlI.
rgeinent, a plenary indulgee, and remission of t's
hs fins. Cardinal di Como wrot to him a letter
to the fame purpose. But though he often got
acccfs to the Queen , fear, or some remaining
sense of duty, refrained him from perpetrating
the crime. Happily, his intention was at las dif-
covered by Nevil, the only person in England to
shom he had communicated it; and he himself March ^.
hlving voluntarily confefed his guilt, he suffered
the pilnilncment which it deserved ".

These repeated conspiracies against their Sover- A revere fn
tein awakened the indignation of. the Englifb t', "WhiEh
parliament, and produced a very extraordinary to Mll..
liatute, which, in the end, proved fatal to the
Qccn of Scots. By this law the affociatoon in
defence of Elizabeth's life was ratified, and it was
further enadc'd, " That if any rebellion Thall be

confider it as a voluntary expression of the zeal
and concern of the nation for Elizabeth's safety, or
whether we impute it to the influence which that
artful Princess preserved over her parliaments, it is
no easy matter to reconcile it with the general prin.
ciples of juflice or humanity. Mary was thereby
rendered accountable not only for her own adiions,
but for those of others; in consequence of which,

her life itself.

Thriporwith Mary justly confidered this ad as a warning to

away her life; and suffered books to be publilbed,
in order to persuade the nation, that this cruel and
unprecedented measure was not only necessary, but

fie resided was converted into a common prison;
and a young man futfpedted of Popery, was confined
there, and treated tunder her eye with such rigor,
that he died of the ill ufige. She often complained to

td as became a woman and a Queen; but as no
political reason now obliged that Princess to amuse
her any longer with fallacious hopes, far from
granting heranyredrefs, Ihe did not even deign to
give her any answer. The King of France, closely
allied to Elizabeth, on whom he depended for
aflillance againrt his rebellious fubjeds, was afraid
ofefpoufing Mary's cause with any warmth; and all
solicitations in her behalf were feeble, formal, and
inefficacious. But Caftlenau, the French Ambassador,
whose compafion and zeal for the unhappy Queen
supplied the defeCts in his inftrutions, remon-
firated with such vigor against the indignities to
which fle was exposed, that, by his importunity,
he prevailed at length to have her removed to

The love which James bore to his mother, whom vil.

aught to confider as one of the most abandoned
persons of her sex, cannot be supposed ever to have
b.en ardent; and he did not now take any pains

attachment to Popery, prompted Mary at any time
othinik seriously ofdifinheriting herfon; or whether
thefr threatenings were uttered in a sudden sally of
diLppointed affection, it is now no easy matter to
determine. Some papers which are still extant seem
to render the former not improbable ".

Cares of another kind, and no less di'quieting, nnaernu,
occtpied Elizabeth's thoughts. The calm which iIo,1th
fle had long enjoyed, seemed now to be at an end;
and such storms were gathering in every quarter,
as filled her with just alarm. All the neighbouring
nations had undergone revolutions extremely to her
disadvantage. The great qualities which Henry III.
had displayed in his youth, and which raised the
expedations of his fubjeds so high, vanifled on his
afccnding the throne; and his acquiring supreme
power seems not only to have corrupted his heart,
but to have impaired his understanding. He soon loft

burfi out with violence. Henry had no children,
and though but thirty-two years of age, the fuc

open. The King of Navarre, a diltant descendant
of the royal family, but the undoubted heir to the

fm the Crown, was a zealous Protestant. The profped ol

the throne of France, alarmed all the Catholics in

of the Cardinal of Bourbon's right to .the Crown,

fom the Philip 1I. by the conquest of Portugal, had greatly
pSoerof increased the naval power of Spain, and had at laRs

u'ilipi. reduced under his dominion all that portion of the

Continent, which lies beyond the Pyrenean

nountains, and which Naturefeemstohave destined BOO K
to form one great monarchy. William, Prince of Vli.
Orange, who firt encouraged the inhabitants of "18.s
the Netherlands to assert their liberties, and whole
wisdom and valor formed and proteced the rising
commonwealth, had fallen by the hands of an aflffin.
The superior genius of the Prince of Parma had
riven an entire turn to the fate of the war in the
Low Countries; all his enterprises, concerted with
consummate Ikill, and executed with equal bravery,
had been attended with success; and the Dutch,
reduced to the last extremity, were on the point
of falling under the dominion of their ancient master.
None of those circumrtances, to which Eliza. Hr wire
beth had hitherto owed her security, existed any rodu.
longer. She could derive no advantage from the
jealousy which had fubfiRed between France and
Spain; Philip, by means of his confederacy with
the Duke of Guise, had an equal sway in the coun-
cils of both kingdoms. The Hugonots were
unable to contend with the power of the League;
ind little could be expeled from any diversion
they might create. Nor was it probable that the
Netherlands could long employ the arms, or divide
he firength, of Spain. In this situation of the
fairs of Europe, it became necessary for Elizabeth
D form a new plan of conduct; and her wildom
n forming it was not greater than the vigor with
rhich The carried it on. The measures, moRft
citable to her natural temper, and which The had
itherto pursued, were cautious and safe; those
itich Ihe now adopted, were enterprising and

Bo o hazardous. She preferred peace, but was notafraid

VIL of war; and was capable, when compelled b!
a1SS. necessity, not only of defending herself with spirit,

but of attacking her enemies with a boldness hbicl
averted danger frem her own dominions. She
immediately furnilhed the Hugonots with a cons
derablefupply in money. She carried on a private
negociation with Henry III. who, though compelled
to join the League, hated the leaders of it, and
wiiehd for their deftrudtion. She openly undertook
the protedion of the Dutch commonwealth ,and feni
a powerful army to its afiftance. She endeavoured
to form a general confederacy of the Proteltan

Rerolmto Princes, in opposition to the Popifi League. She

i. tbe the Queen of Scots, whose sufferings and rigbh
>K"i afforded her enemies a specious pretence for ii

vading her dominions. She resolved to redouble
her endeavours, in order to effedt a closer union
with Scotland, and to extend and perpetuate hei
influence over the councils of that nation.

She found it po difficult matter to induce mol

of the Scottish courtiers to promote all her designs
Gray, Sir John Maitland, who had been advanced
to the office of Secretary, which his brother for
merly held, Sir Lewic Bellenden, the Justice Clerk,
who had succeeded Gray as the King's resident al
London, were the persons in whom Ihe chiefly
confided. In order to direct and quicken theil
Ma :99. motions, The dispatched Sir Edward Wotton along

with Bellenrlen into Scotland. This man was gay,
well-bred, and enteraining; he excelled in aL

the exercises for which James had a passion; and B o o K
amused the young King by relating the adventures vil.
which he had met with, and the observations he sr-
had made, during a long residence in foreign
countries; but' under the veil of these superficial
qualities, he concealed a dangerous and intriguing
spirit. He soon grew into high favor with James,
andt while he was seemingly attentive only to pleasure,
and diversions, he acquired influence over the public
councils, to a degree which was indecent for a
franger to poTfefs ".

Nothing, however, could be more'acceptable to Propores
the nation, than the proposal he made of a firia le'age".ith
alliance between the two kingdoms, in defence of
the Reformed Religion. The rapid and alarming
progrcfs of the Popifi League seemed to call on all
Protellant Princes to unite for the preservation of
their common faith. James embraced the overture July :,.
with warmth, and a Convention of estates empowered
him to conclude such a treaty, and engaged to ratify
it in parliament ". The alacrity with which James
concurred in this measure must not be wholly ascribed
tither to his own zeal, or to Wotton's address; it
was owing in part to Elizabeth's liberality. As a
mark of her motherly affection for the young King,
Ife fettled on him an annual pension of five thousand
pouond(; the fame fum which her father had al.
lotted her before file ascended the throne. This
tircumllnce, which she took care to mention,

undemiman But the chief object of Wotton's intrigues, was
Au's to ruin Arran. While a milion so odious to the

nation continued to govern the King, his afilRance
could be of little advantage to Elizabeth. And
though Arran,even since his interview with Hundon,
bad appeared extremely for her interell, The could
place no great confidence in a man whose condud was
so capricious and irregular, and who, notwithbtand.
ing his protestations to the contrary, fill continued
a secret correspondence both with Mary and with

this plan, and endeavoured to ripen it for exe

neither uncommon nor considerable. Sir John

killed. This scuffle was purely accidental, but B o o K
I|z.,bcth chose to confider it as a design formed vii.
by Ker, at the instigation of Arran, to involve the IsS.
two kingdoms in war. She infifled that both Ihould
be tdlivered up to her; and though James eluded
that demand, he was obliged to confine Arran in
St. Xndrew's, and Ker in Aberdeen. During his Affinsthe
ablence from court, Wotton and his associates banihet
carried on their intrigues without interruption. By
their advice, the banilhed nobles endeavoured to
accommnodate their differences with Lord John and
LordClaud, the Duke of Chatelherault's two sons,
whom Morton's violence had driven out of the
kingdom. Their common sufferings, and common oa. i.
interelt, induced both parties to bury in oblivion the
ancient discord which had subsisted between the
houses of Hamilton and Douglas. By Elizabeth's
permifflon, they returned in a body to the borders
of Scotland. Arran, who had again recovered
favor, insisted on putting the kingdom in a pof-
ture of defence. But Gray, Bellenden, and Mait.
land secretly thwarted all his measures. Some
necessary orders they prevented from being issued;
others they rendered ineffectual, by the manner of
I xecution; and all of them were obeyed slowly, and
with reluctance ".
Wotton's fertile brain was, at the fame time,
big with another and more dangerous plot. He
had contrived to seize the King, and to carry him
byforce into England. But the design was happily

rTheyren, Meanwhile the banilied Lords hastened th(

lads a execution of their enterprise; and as their friend
*iereou and vasals were now ready to join them, they en.
itedt t tered Scotland. Wherever they came, they were

welcomed as the deliverers of their country, and the
mos fervent prayers were addressed to Heaven for the
success of their arms. They advanced, without lofinS
a moment, towards Stirling, at the head often thou.
sand men. The King, though he had assemblcd an
army superior in number, could pot venture to mcet
them in the field, with troops whose loyalty was
extremely dubious, and who, at bes, were far from
being hearty in the cause; nor was either the town
or castle provided for a siege. The gates, however,
of both were ihut, and the nobles encamped at St
]vb. =. Ninian's. That fame night they surprised the town

or more probably it was betrayed into their hands
and Arran, who had undertaken to defendit, wa
obliged to save himself by a precipitate flight. Next
morning,they invested the castle, in which there wern
not provisions for twenty-four hours; and James was
necessitated immediately to hearken to terms o
accommodation. They were not so elated wid
success, as to urge extravagant demands, nor was
the King unwilling to make every reasonable con
cession. They obtained a pardon in the mos
ample form, of all the offences which they has

The Clergy were the only body of men who cirar.
obtained no redress of their grievances by this re- ai"'

Isss. fruit of these promises, and some returns of gra.

titude towards many of the most eminent preach.
ers who had suffered in their cause, and who
demanded the repeal of the laws passed the preceding
year. The King, however, was resolute to maintain
these laws in full authority; and as the nobles were
extremely solicitous not to disgust him, by infilling
on any disagreeable request, the claims of the Church
in this, as well as in many former instances, were
sacrificed to the interest of the laity. The Minitlers
gave vent to their indignation in the pulpit, and their
impatience under the disappointment broke out in
some expreflions extremely difrefpetful even
towards the King himself '.
ic. The Archbilhop of St. Andrew's, too, felt the

effects of their anger. The Provincial Synod of
Fife summoned him to appear, and to answer for
his contempt of the decrees of former Assemblies,
in presuming to exercise the function of a Bilbop.
Though he refused to acknowledge the jurifdic.
tion of the court, and appealed from it to the
King, a sentence of excommunication, equally in-
decent and irregular, was pronounced against him.
Adamson, with no less indecency, thundered his
arcliepifcopal excommunication against Melvil,
and some others of his opponents.
April . Soon after, a General Assembly wa« held, in

which the King, with some difficulty, obtained an

to continue in the Church. The power of the order, VII.
however, was considerably retrenched. The exercise 1586.
ofrlifcipline,and the irifpedion of the life and docrine
ofthe Clergy, were committed to Preffyteries, in
which Bishops should be allowed no other pre-
eminence, but that of presiding as perpetual modera-
tors. They themselves were declared to be fubjedt,
in the fame manner as other pastors, to the jurifdilion
of the General Assembly. As the discussion of the
Archbinlop's appeal might have kindled unusual
heats in the Assembly, that affair was terminated
by a compromise. He renounced any claim of
supremacy over the Church, and promised to de-
mean himself suitably to the character of a Bishop,
as decribed by St. Paul. The Assembly, with-
out examining the foundations of the sentence of
excommunication, declared that it Ihould be held
of no cited, and restored him to all the privileges
which he enjoyed before it was pronounced. Not-
withlanding the extraordinary tenderness Ihown
for the honor of the fynod, and the delicacy and
refpef with which its jurifdition was treated,
several members were so zealous as to protest
azainft this decision "

jiJ a. vwhich fle so much desired. The danger to which the

Protestant religion was exposed, by the late combi.
nation of the Popifl powers for its deftrution, and
the neceflity ofa striA confederacy among those who
had embraced the Reformation, in order to obfltruf
their pernicious designs, were mentioned as the
foundation of the league. The chief articles in it
were, that both parties should bind themselves to
defend the Evangelic Religion; that the league

Scotland, James Ihould afift the Queen with two
thousand horse and five thousand foot; that if the
enemy landed or approached within sixty miles of
Scotland, the King (hould take the field with his
whole forces, in the fame manner as he would do in
defence of his own kingdom. Elizabeth, in return,
undertook to a& in defence of Scotland, if it should
be invaded. At the fame time she assured the King
that no ftep Ihould be taken, which might dero.

English Crown ". Elizabeth expressed great a.

1lli eranceflors had aimed at, but none of them had 1s86i

the blellings ofpeace,which both kingdoms had enjoy)
ed during a considerable period, had so far abated the
violence of national antipathy, that the King's con-
duc! was universally acceptable to his own people ".

The acquittal of Archibald Douglas, at this time,
exposed James to much and deserved censure. This
man was deeply engaged in the conspiracy against the
life of the King his father. Both Morton and Binny

had accused him of being present at the murder". He
bad escaped pnnifhment by flying into England, and
Jameshad often required Elizabeth to deliver up a
person so unworthy of her protection. He now
obtained a licence, from the King himself, to return
into Scottand; and after undergoing a mock-trial,
calculated to conceal, rather than to detedt his
guilt, he was not only taken into favor by the
King, but sent back to the court of England, with
the honorable charader of his ambassador, James
was now of such an age, that his youth and inex-
perience cannot be pleaded in excuse for this indecent
tranhadion. It muff be imputed to the exceflive
facility of his temper, which often led him togratify
his courtiers at the expense of his own dignity and
reputation ".

Dodor Gifford, Gilbert Giffort, and Hodgson

prierf educated in the seminary at Rheims, ha(
adopted an extravagant and epthufiaftic notion, tha
the Bull of Pius V. against Elizabeth was didate(
immediately by the Holy GhoR. This wild opinioi
they instilled into Savage, an officerin the Spanif
army, noted for his furious zeal and daring courage
and persuaded him that no service could be so accept
able to Heaven, as to take away thelife of an excom
municated Heretic. Savage, eager to obtain thi
A.ril :i crown of martyrdom, bound himself by a folemi

vow to kill Elizabeth. Ballard, a pragmatical pries
of that feminarv. had at that time come over t(
Paris, and foiicited M'lendoza, the Spanilh am
ball;dor there, to procure an invasion of Eng
land, while the affairs of the league were f(
prosperous, and the kingdom left naked by fend
ing so many of the Queen's bell troops into thi
Netherlands. Paget and the English exiles de
monfirated the fruijcffnefs 6f such an attempt
unless Plizabeth were firt cut off, or the invader
secured of a powerful concurrence on their land
ing. If it could be hoped that either of the[
events would happen, effetual aid was promised

and in the mean time Ballard was sent back to B o OK
renew his intrigues. VII.

lie communicated his designs to Anthony Babing- 1t86.
tol, a young gentleman in Derbyihire, of a large *a

;

fortune, and many amiable qualities, who having
contracted, during his residence in France, a fami-
liarity with the Archbilhop of Glasgow, had been
recommended by him to the Queen of Scots. He
concurred with Paget, in confidering the death of
Elizabeth as a necessary preliminary to any invasion.
Ballard gave him hopes that an end would soon
be put to her days, and imparted to him Savage's
vow, who was now in London waiting for an
opportunity to strike the blow. But Babington
thought the attempt of too much importance, to
rely on a tingle hand for the execution of it, and
proposed that five resolute gentlemen Ihould be
joined with Savage, in an enterprise, the success
of which was the foundation of all their hopes.
He offered to find out persons willing to under-
take the service, whose honor, secrecy, and courage
they might faiely trust. He accordingly opened
the matter to Edward Windsor, Thomas Salisbury,
Charles Tilney, Chidioc Tichbourne, Robert Gage,
John Travers, Robert Barnwell,. John Charnock,
Henry Dun, John Jones, and Robert Polly, all of
them, except Polly, whose buflling forward zeal
introduced him into their society, gentlemen of
good families, united together in the bonds of
priv.ate fricndfllip, strengthened by the more power-
ful tie of religious zeal. Many consultations were Jos,,
held; their plan of operations was at last fettled;

B 0 0 K and their different parts aflgned. Babington him.

vlq. self was appointed to rescue the Queen of Scotc;
ls". Salisbury, with some others, undertook to excite

The Cch-me several counties to take arms; the murder of the
of he c..rpi-

t Queen, the molt dangerous and important service

of all, fell to Tichbourne and Savage, with four
associates. So totally had their bigoted prejudices
extinguilbed the principles of honor, and the senti.
ments of humanity suitable to their rank, that, with.
out scruple or compuncion, they undertook an
action which is viewed with horror, even when
committed by the meanest and most profligate of
mankind. This attempt, on the contrary, appeared
to them no less honorable than it was desperate;
and in order to perpetuate the memory of it, they
had a picure drawn containing the portraits of the
fix affafins, with that of Babington in the middle,
and a motto intimating that they were jointly
embarked in some hazardous design.

ircowered hy The conspirators, as appears by this wanton and
WVdrigham. imprudent inflance of vanity, seem to have thought

a discovery scarcely pofuble, and neither diflruRled
the fidelity of their companions, nor doubted the
success of their undertaking. But while they be.
lieved that their machinations were carried on with
the molt profound and impenetrable secrecy, every
ftep they took was fully known to Walsingham.
Polly was one of his spies, and had entered into
the conspiracy with no other design than to betray
his associates. Gilbert Gifford too, having been
sent over to England to quicken the motions of
the conspirators, had been gained by Walsingham,

and gave him sure intelligence of all their projeds. B o o K
'lhat vigilant Minister immediately imparted the vil.
discoveries which he had made to Elizabeth; and "st.
without communicating the matter to any other
of the Counsellors, they agreed, in order to
underfltlnd the plot more perfectly, to wait until
it waq ripened into some form, and brought near
the point of execution.

At last, Elizabeth thought it dangerous and The are
criminal to expose her own life, and to tempt puihd":.
Providence any farther. Ballard, the prime mover AuguRt 4.
in the whole conspiracy, was arrested. His affoci-
ates, disconcerted and firuck with aflonilhment,
endeavoured to save themselves by flight. But,
within a few days, all of them, except Windsor,
were; seized in different places of the kingdom,
and committed to the Tower. Though they had
undertaken the part, they wanted the firm and
determined spirit of affaflins; and', influenced by
fear or by hope, at once confessed all that they
knew. The indignation of the people, and their
impatience to revenge such an execrable combina-
tion against the life of their Sovereign, haftcned
their trial, and all of them suffered the death of
traitors".
Thus far Elizabeth's conduct may be pronounced stpt. :o0

blary is accur.

both prudent and laudable, nor can The be accused ed uh ein an
of violating any law of humanity, or of taking accomplicein

any precautions beyond what were necessary for ,ray.
her own safety. But a tragical scene followed, with
" Camd. i;t. State Trials, vol i. Ile.

0o o regard to which posterity will pals a very different
VIL judgment.
M"" FThe frantic zeal of a few rash young men accounts

sufficiently for all the wild and wicked designs
which they had formed. But this was not the light
in which Elizabeth and her Ministers chose to
place the conspiracy. They wished to persuade the
nation, that Babington and his associates lhould be
confidered merely as instruments employed by the
Queen of Scots, the real though secret author of
so many attempts against the life of Elizabeth, and
the peace of her kingdoms. They produced letters,
which they ascribed to her, in support of this
charge. These, as they gave out, had come into
their bands by the following singular and mysterious
method of conveyance. Gifford, on his return into
England, had been trusted by some of the exiles
with letters to Mary; but in order to make a trial
of his fidelity and address, they were only blank
papers made up in that form. These being safely
delivered by him, he was afterwards employed
without farther scruple. Walsingham having found
means to gain this man, he, by the permiflion of
that Minister and the connivance of Paulet, bribed
a tradefinan in the neighbourhood of Chartley,
whither Mary had been conveyed, who deposited
the letters in a hole in the wall of the caflle,
covered with a loose stone. Thence they were
taken by the Queen, and in the fame manner her
answers returned. All these were carried to Walfing.
ham, opened by him, decyphered, fealed again so
dexterously that the fraud could not be perceived,

and then transmitted to the persons to whom they B oo oK
were directed. Two letters to Babington, with vlI.
feversl to Mendoza, Paget, Englefield, and the 1sas.
Ewglifh fugitives, were procured by this artifice. It
was given out, that in these letters Mary approved
of the conspiracy, and even of the assassination; that
she dircded them to proceed with the utmost
circumfpe&ion, and not to take arms until foreign
auxiliaries were ready to join them; that Ihe recom.
mended the Earl of Arundel, his brothers, and the
young Farl of Northumberland, as proper persons
to condut and to add reputation to their enterprise;
that she advised them, if possible, to excite at the
fame time some commotion in Ireland; and above
all, besought them to concert with care the means
of her own escape, suggesting to them several ex.
pedients for that purpose.
All there circumstances were opened at the trial The indigna;

tioa of the

of the conspirators; and while the nation was under Eiglih
the influence of those terrors which the association agailni hci
had raised, and the late danger had augmented, ° ,h,,
they were believed without hesitation or inquiry,
and spread a general alarm. Mary's zeal for her
religion was well known; and in that age, examples
of the violent and sanguinary spirit which it inspired
vere numerous. All the cabals against the peace
of tb. kingdom for many years had been carried
on in her name; and it now appears evidently,
said the English, that the safety of the one Queen
is incompatible with that of the other. Why then,
added they, should the tranquillity of England be
sacrificed for the fake of a stranger ? Why is a life

o o i so dear to the nation exposed to the repeated
vil. assaults of an exasperated rival? The cafe supposed
's8. in the association has now happened, the sacred

person of our Sovereign has been threatened, and
why Ihould not an injured people execute that
just vengeance which they had vowed ?

Eirthta No sentiments could be more agreeable than theft

CfoID to Elizabeth and her Ministers. They themselves
the .od had at firlt propagated them among the people,
exrmitie and they now served both as an apology and a

r motive for their proceeding to such extremities

against the Scottilb Queen as they bad long medi.
tated. The more numerous the injuries were which
Elizabeth had heaped on Mary, the more fhc
feared and hated that unhappy Queen, and came
at las to be persuaded that there could be no
other security for her own life, but the death ol
her rival. Burleigh and Walsingham had promoted
so zealously all her measures with regard to Scot
tifh affairs; and had acted, with so little reserve,
in opposition to Mary, that they had reason to
dread the most violent effecs of her resentment, ii
ever Ihe should mount the throne of England. From
this additional consideration they endeavoured,
with the utmost earnestness, to hinder an event so
fatal to themselves, by confirming their Mistress's
fear and hatred of the Scottili Queen.

Herdoner- Meanwhile, Mary was guarded with ur.ufual
"''s, si: . vigilance, and great care was taken to keep her

ignorant of the discovery of the conspiracy. Sir
Thomas Gorges was at last sent from court to
acquaint her both of it, and of the imputation

with which Ahe was loaded as accessary to that B o K
crime; and he surprised her with the account just vli.
Ja Ihe had got on horseback to ride out along 15S6.
with her keepers. She was firuck with alfonilh.
mnt, and would have returned to her apartment,
but fIe was not permitted; and in her absence,
her private closet was broke open, her cabinet and
pipers were seized, fealed, and sent up to court.
lier principal domestics too were arrested, and
committed to different keepers. Naue and Curie,
her two secretaries, the one a native of France,
the other of Scotland, were carried prisoners to
London. All the money in her custody, amount-
ing to little more than two thousand pounds, was
secured ". And after leading her about, for some
days, from one gentleman's house to another, lhe

what flould be her fate. With regard to this, proceeding.
Elizabeth, and those Ministers in whom Ihe chiefly
confided, seem to have taken their resolution; but
there was fill great variety of sentiments among
her other Counfcllors. Some thought it sufficient
to dismiss all Mary's attendants, and to keep her
under such close restraint, as would cut off all
poflniility of corresponding with the enemies of
the kingdom; and as her constitution, broken by
long contineme.ic, and her spirit dejeded with to

BOO K many cares, could not long support such an addi.

vii. tional load, the Queen and nation would soon be
s1U. delivered from all their fears. But though it might

be easy to secure Mary's own person, it was impoffi.
fible to diminish the reverence which the Roman
Catholics had for her name, or to extinguilh the
compassion with which they viewed her sufferings;
while such sentiments continued, infurredions and
invasions would never be wanting for her relief, and
the only effec of any new rigor would be to render
there attempts more frequent and more dangerous.
For this reason the expedient was rejected.
DtrmiK A public and legal trial, though the molt unexam.

he pled, was judged the most unexceptionable method

of proceeding; and it had, at the fame time, a
semblance of justice, accompanied with an air of
dignity. It was in vain to search the ancient records
for any statute or precedent to justify such an
uncommon fRep, as the trial of a foreign Prince,
who had not entered the kingdom in arms, but had
fled thither for refuge. The proceedings against her
were founded on the aft of last Parliament, and
by applying it in this manner, the intention of
those who had framed that severe statute became
more apparent ".

Elizabeth resolved that no circumstance of pomp

or solemnity should be wanting, which could
render this tranfadtion such as became the dignity
of the person to be tried. She appointed, by a
commillion under the great feal, forty persons,

the

the moRilluirious in the kingdom by their birth or o o K
offices, together with five of the judges, to hear nil.
and decide this great cause. Many difficulties were is.
larted by the lawyers about the name and title
by which Mary lhould be arraigned; and while the
ciretials of justice were so grossly violated, the
empty forms of it were the objects of their care.
They at length agreed that fie mhould be styled
i Rlary, daughter and heir of James V. late King
"of Scots, commonly called Queen of Scots, and
, Dowager of France'."
After the many indignities which she had lately
fufered, Mary could no longer doubt but that her
dellruclion was determined. She expected, every
moment, to end her days by poison, or by some
ofthofe secret means usually employed against captive
Princes. Left the malice of her enemies, at the fame
time that it deprived her of life, lhould endeavour
likewise to biaft her reputation, the wrote to the
Duke of Guise, and vindicated herself, in the
Itrongeft terms, from the imputation of encouraging
orof beingacceffary totheconfpiracy for assassinating
Elizabeth ". In the solitude of her prison, the
firnge resolution of bringing her to a public trial
had not reached her ears, nor did the idea of any
thing so unprecedented, and so repugnant to regal
Majclty, once enter into her thoughts.
On the eleventh of October, the Commiflioners Theti,, lat
appointed by Elizabeth arrived at Fotheringay. FotnuIpr.
Next morning they delivered a letter from thei;

0oo Sovereign to Mary, in which, after the bittereR
VIi. reproaches and accusations, Ihe informed her,
aslS that regard for the happiness of the nation had,

at last, rendered it necessary to make a public
inquiry into her conduc, and therefore required
her, as Ihe had lived so long under the protedion
of the laws of England, to submit now to the trial,
which they ordained to be taken of her crimes

M re. Mary, though surprised at this message, was neitbhe
f*"w appalled at the danger, nor unmindful of herown

dignity. She protested, in the most solemn manne,
that Ihe was innocent of the crime laid to ha
charge, and had never countenanced any attempi
against the life of the Queen of England; but, a
the fame time, refused to acknowledge the jurit
diction of her commifioners. " I came into thi

kingdom, " said Ihe," an independent Sovereign

B to implore the Queen's afiftance, not to subjed
a myself to her authority. Nor is my spirit so broke
" by its paR misfortunes, or so intimidated b]

" Its laws never afforded me any protection. Le
g them not now be perverted, in order to tak
a away my life."

The Commiflioners employed arguments and B 0 0
entreaties to overcome Mary's resolution. They vll.
even threatened to proceed according to the forms 1ss6.
of law, and to pass sentence against her on account
of her contumacy in refusing to plead; Ihe perfiltef,
however, for two days to decline their jurifdidion.

lain, at last prevailed. He told her, that, by
avoiding a trial, Ihe injured her own reputation,
and deprived herself of the only opportunity of
setting her innocence in a clear light; and that
nothing would be more agreeable to them, or more
acceptable to the Queen their Miflrefs, than to be
convinced, by undoubted evidence, that The had
been unjustly loaded with foul aspersions.

No wonder pretexts so plausible should impose Conrents
on the unwary Queen, or that lhe, unassisted, at do'

so.

be able to detet and elude all the artifices of Eli.

lar, her grandson, Charles I. refused, with the
utmost firmness, to acknowledge the usurped ju-
fifdicion of the High Court of Justice; and pof.
terity has approved his conduct, as suitable to the
dignity of a King. If Mary was less conRtant in
her resolution, it mull be imputed solely to her
anxious desire of vindicating her own honor.

he acc. Then 4lizabeth's Attorney and Solicitor opened
s.ao a. the charge against her, with all the circumflances
pitl t of the late conspiracy. Copies of Mary's letters to

Alendoza, Babington, Englefield, and Pagetwere
produced, Babington'sconfeflion, those of Ballard,
Savage, and the other conspirators, together'with
the declarations of Naue and Curie her secretaries,
were read, and the whole ranged in the most
specious order, which the art of the lawyers could
devise, and heightened by every color their clo,
quence could add.

Mary listened to their harangues attentisely,

and without emotion. But at the mention of the
Earl of Arundel's name, who was then confined
in the Tower, she brcke out into this tender and
generous exclamation: "Alas! how much has the
U noble House of Howard suffered for my fake!"
H dtfetnc. When the Queen's counsel had finimfed, Mary

flood up, and with great magnanimity, and equa
prefenct of mind, began her defence... She bewailed
the unlappioef, of her own situation, that afteri
captivity of ninRtecn years, during which ihe ha'
suffered treatment no Iefs cruel than unmerited,
Ihe was at last loaded with an accusation, whicl
tended not only to rob her of her right of fuccefion

jnd to deprive her of life itself, but to transmit her B oK
!awe witlh infamy to future ages: That, without vil.
regarding the sacred rights of Sovereignty, Rle was Ifs.
,ow fnbjeccd to laws framed againlt private per-
folnI though an anointed (2ueen, commanded to
.ppear before the tribunal of fubjeds; and , like a
common criminal, her honor exposed to the pe.
tulant tongues of lawyers, capable of wresting
her words, and of misrepresenting her actions:
That, even in this dilhonorable situation, fle
was denied the privileges usually granted to cri.
minals, and obliged to undertake her own de-
lence, without the presence of any friend with
whom to advise, without the aid of counsel, and
without the use of her own papers.

She then proceeded to the particular articles in
theaccufation. She abfolutcly denied any corre-
lpondence with Babington or Ballard: Copies
only of her pretended letters to them were pro-
duced; though nothing less than her hand-writing
or subscription was sufficient to convict her of such
an odious crime: No proof could be brought that
theletters were delivered into her hands, or that
any answer was returned by her direction: The
confellions of wretches condemned and executed for
uich a detellable action, were of little weight; fear
or hope might extort from them many things
inconfifent with truth, nor ought the honor of a
Queen to be Rained by such vile testimony. The
declaration of her secretaries was not more conclu-
five: Promises and threats might easily overcome
tht rTolution of two strangers; in order to fcrecn

Z3

30 OK themselves, they might throw the blame on her;

vii. but they could discover nothing to her prejudice,
S"S5. without violating, in the first place, the oath of

fidelity which they had sworn to her; and their
perjury, in one inflance, rendered them unworthy
of credit in another: The letters to the Spanifl
Ambassador were either nothing more than copies,
or contained only what was perfetly innocent:
' I have often," continued (he, "made such efforts
" for the recovery of my liberty, as are natural toa
" human creature. Convinced, by the fad experi.

ence of so many years, that it was vain to expet

" it from the justice or generosity of the Queen

O Princes, and called upon all my friends to employ
a their whole interest for my relie I have, like.
" wife, endeavoured to procure for the Englilh

Catholics some mitigation of the rigor with which
they are now treated; and if I could hope, by
" my death, to deliver them from oppression, I

am willing to die for their fake. I wiTh, how.
ever, to imitate the example of EfRher, not of

" Judith, and would rather make interceflion for
" my people, than shed the blood of the meanef
" creature, in order to save them. I have often

checked the intemperate zeal of my adherents,
" when either the severity of their own perse.

cutions, or indignation at the unheard-of injuries

" which I have endured, were apt to precipitate
" them into violent councils. I have even warned
" the (ueen of dangers to which there harlb pro.
" ceedings exposed berfelf. And worn out, as I

· now am, with cares and sufferings, the profpet B0 K
s ofa Crown is not so inviting, thatllhould ruin v1I.

"to the feelings of humanity, nor unacquainted
"itlh the duties of religion, and abhor the detelt-
' able crine of affaflination, as equally repugnant

to both. And, if ever I have given consent by-
'"my words, or even by my thoughts, to any
* attempt against the life of the Queen of England,
" far from declining the judgment of men, I shall
" not even pray for the mercy of God "."
Two different days did Mary appear before the
judges, and in every part of her behaviour main-
tained the magnanimity of a Queen, tempered
with the gentleness and modelty of a woman.

The Commifioners, by Elizabeth's express sentence a.
command, adjourned, without pronouncing any gainRher
sentence, to the Star-Chamber in Westminster.
When assembled in that place, Naue and Curie
were brought into court, and confirmed their
former declaration upon oath; and after review-
ing all their proceedings, the Commissioners
unanimously declared Mary " To be accessary
"to Babington's conspiracy, and to have ima-
"gined diverse matters, tending to the hurt,
"death, and deftrudion of Elizabeth, contrary
a to the express words of the Ratute, made for

oO flagrant. By what right did Elizabeth claim authority
VIL over an independent Queen ? Was Mary bound to
»Sr' comply with the laws of a foreign kingdom ? How

could the fubjecs of another Prince become her
judges ? or if such an insult on royalty were allowed,
ought not the common forms of justice to have
been observed? If the testimony of Babington
and his affociateswere so explicit, why did notEliza
beth spare them for a few weeks, and, by confront.
ing them with Mary, overwhelm her with the full
convition of her crimes? Naue and Curie were
both alive, wherefore did not they appear at
Fotheringay, and for what reason were they pro.
duced in the Star-Chamber, where Mary was not
present to hear what they deposed ? Was this
suspicious evidence enough to condemn a Queen!
Ought the meaner criminal to have been found
guilty upon such feeble and inconclusive proofs?

It was not, however, on the evidence pro.

duced at her trial, that the sentence againit
AMary was founded. That served as a pretence to
jnftify, but was not the cause of the violent Reps
taken by Elizabeth and her Ministers towards her
defiruAion; and was employed to give some ap
pearance of justice to what was the offspring of
jealousy and fear. The nation, blinded with re.
fentment againif Mary, and solicitous to secure
the life of its own Sovereign from every danger,
observed no irregularities in the proceedings, and
attended to no defets in the proof, but grasped
at suspicions and probabilities, as if they had bena
irrefragable demonstrations.

The parliament met a few days after sentence BOOK

equally under the dominion of popular prejudices
and piflions. and the fame excesses of zeal or of fear,
which prevailed in the nation are apparent in all
their proceedings. They entered with impatience
upon an inquiry into the conspiracy, and the danger
which threatened the Queen's life as well as the peace
of the kingdom. All the papers which had been
produced at Fotheringay, were laid before them;
and after many violent invetives against the Queen
of Scots, both Houses, unanimously, ratified the
proceedings of the Commissioners by whom Ihe had
been tried, and declared the sentence against her to
be jufl and well founded. Not satisfied with this, and dem"and

preservation of the Protestant religion, the welfare
and wifics of her people, to publish the sentence;
and without farther delay to inflict on a rival, no

which Ihe had merited by so many crimes. This
request, ditated by fears unworthy of that great
Assembly, was enforced by reasons still more un-
worthy. They were drawn not from justice, but
from conveniency. The most rigorous confinement,
itwas pretended, could not curb Mary's intriguing
spirit; her address was found, by long experience,
to be an overmatch for the vigilance and jealousy

B O of all her keepers: The severest penal laws could
Vi. not restrain her adherents, who, while they believed

* her person to be sacred, would despise any danger

to which themselves alone were exposed: Several
foreign Princes were ready to second their attempts,
and waited only a proper opportunity for invading
the kingdom, and aflerting the Scottilb Queen's
title to the Crown. Her life, they contended, was,
for these reasons, incompatible with Elizabeth's safe.
ty; and if she were spared out of a false clemency,
the Queen's person, the religion and liberties of the
kingdom, could not be one moment secure. Necef.
fity required that Ibe lbould be sacrificed in order
to preserve there; and to prove this sacrifice to
be no less just than neceflary, several examples in
history were produced, and many texts of scripture
quoted; but both the one and the other were
misapplied, and diltorted from their true meaning.

mfhbe*~ ' Nothing, however, could be more acceptable to
aa-taos-. Elizabeth, than an address in this (train. It extri.

cated her out of a situation extremely embarrassing;
and without depriving her of the power of sparing,
it enabled her to punilh her rival with less appear.
ance of blame. If she chose the former, the whole
honor would redound to her own clemency. If
the determined on the latter, whatever was rigor.
ous might now seem to be extorted by the solicit
ations of her people, rather than to flow from
her own inclination. Her answer, however, was
in a ftylc which The often used, ambiguous and
evasive, under the appearance of openness and
candor; full of such profellions of regard for her

people, as served to heighten their loyalty; of B 0 0 K
such complaints of Mary's ingratitude, as were vil.
calculated to excite their indignation; and of such .Isa.
i,;lnuations that her own life was in danger, as
could not fail to keep alive their fears. In the end,
fne belfought them to save her the infamy and the
plai of delivering up a Queen, her nearest kinf-
woman, to punishment; and to confider whether
it might not fill be possible to provide for the

hands in royal blood.

The. uue meaning of this reply was easily under.
flood. T'le Lords and Commons renewed their
former requelt, with additional importunity, which
was far from being either unexpected or oflenfive.
Elizabeth did not return any answer more explicit;
and having obtained such a public sanCtion of her
proceedings, there was no longer any reason for
protracting this scene of diflimulation; there was
even some danger that her feigned difficulties
might at las be treated as real ones; fle therefore
adjourned the parliament, and reserved in her own
hands the sole disposal of her rival's fate ".

filial concern, and with the sentiments which be.
came a King. The pride of the Scottilh nation was
routed, by the insult offered to the blood of their
Monarchs, and called upon him to employ the
mos vigorous efforts, in order to prevent or to
revenge the Queen's death.

At firR, he could hardly believe that Elizabeth

would venture upon an ation so unprecedented,
which tended so visibly to render the persons of

"Camd. 531.

frillces Icfs sacred in the eyes of the people, and BOOK
which degraded the regal dignity, of which, at vIt.
other times, she was so remarkably jealous. But 1'55
as soon as the extraordinary steps which Ihe took
dicovered her intention, he dispatched Sir William
Kcith to London; who, together with Douglas
his Ambassador in ordinary, remonstrated, in the
strongest terms, against the injury done to an inde-
peildent queen, in subjecting her to be tried like
a private person, and by laws to which Ile owed
no obedience; and besought Elizabeth not to add
to this injury, by suffering a sentence unjust ili
itself, as well as dishonorable to the King of Scots,
to be put into execution ".

Elizabeth returning no answer to these remon-
firances of his ambassadors, James wrote to her with
his own hand, complaining in the bitterest terms
of her conduct, not without threats that both his
duty and his honor would oblige him to renounce
her friendship, and to act as became a son when
called to revenge his mother's wrongs '. At the
fame time he assembled the nobles, who promised
to Rand by him in so good a cause. He appointed
ambassadors to France, Spain, and Denmark, in
order to implore the aid of these courts; and took
other fReps towards executing his threats with vigor.
The high firain of his letter enraged Elizabeth to
such a degree, that Ihe was ready to dismiss his
ambassadors without any reply. But his prepara.
tions alarmed and embarrassed her Ministers, and

with expressions of triumph. " No wonder, laid

nities, and offended at this gross familiarity, to 1186.

time, as her last request, entreated that the would
permit her servants to carry her dead body into
France, to be laid among her ancestors in hallowed
ground; that some of her domestics might be present
at her death, to bear witness of her innocence, and
firm adherence to the Catholic faith; that all her
servants might be suffered to leave the kingdom,
and to enjoy those small legacies which the should
betow on them, as testimonies of her affection; and
that, in the mean time, her almoner, or some other
Catholic Priest, might be allowed to attend her,
and to alfifi her in preparing for an eternal world.
She besought her, in the name of Jesus, by the
foul and memory of Henry VII. their common
progenitor, by their near consanguinity, and the
royal dignity with which they were both invested,
to gratify her in there particulars, and to indulge
her f far as to signify her compliance by a letter
under her own hand. Whether Mary's letter was
ever delivered to Elizabeth is uncertain. No anfwcr
was returned, and no regard paid to her request.

thata Princess, naturally so cautious as Elizabeth,
iould venture on an action, which might expose
her memory to infamy, and her life and kingdom to

had entered England with all their forces; and a con.
fpiracy, it was whispered, was on foot for seizing
theQueen, and burning the city. The panic grew
every day more violent; and the people, aftonilbed
and enraged, called for the execution of the fen-

o o x frike the blow, which The had so long meditated
vii. She commanded Davison, one of the secretaries of
153l state, to bring to her the fatal warrant; and her

behaviour on that occasion plainly fisowed that it i
not to humanity that we must ascribe her forbearance
hitherto. At the very moment Iie wasfigningthe
writ which gave up a woman, a Queen, and her own
nearest relation, into the hands of the executioner,
iBc was capable of jesting." Go," fays Ihe to Davifoo,
* and tell Walsingham what I have now done, though
I am afraid he will die for grief when he hears it "
Her chief anxiety was how to secure the advantage
which would arise from Mary's death, without
appearing to have given her content to a deed b
odious. She often hinted to Paulet and Drury, a
well as to some other courtiers, that now was the
time to discover the sincerity of their concern for her
safety, and that (be expeaed their zeal would ex.
tricate her out of her present perplexity. But they
were wife enough to seem not to understand he
meaning. Even after the warrant was signed, si
commanded a letter to be written to Paulet, in Ies
ambiguous terms, complaining of his remiffeds in
sparing so long the life of her capital enemy, and
begging him to remember atlaft what was incumbent
on him as an affectionate subjed, as well as what he
wis bound to do by the oath of association, and to
deliver his Sovereign from continual fear and danger,
by hfortening the days of his prisoner. Paulet, though
rigorous and harlh, and often brutal in the dilf
charge of what he thought his duty, as Mary's
keeper, was nevertheless a man of honor and

integrity. He rejected the proposal with disdain; B o
tandlamenting that he Ihould ever have been deemed VII.
capable of ading the part of an assassin, he declared assr.
that the Queen might dispose of his life at her
pleasure, but that he would never fain his own
honor, nor leave an everlaPfing mark of infamy on
his poferity, by lending his hand to perpetrate so
foul a crime. On the receipt of this answer, Eliza.
beth became extremely peevish; and calling him a
dainty and precise fellow, who would promise much,
but perform nothing, fte proposed to employ one
Wlingfield, who had both courage and inclination
to frike the blow ". But Davison remonstrating
againR this, as a deed dilhonorable in itself, and of
dangerous example, the again declared herintention
that the sentence pronounced by the commifioners
Ihould be executed according to law; and as he had
already signed the warrant , le begged that no farther
application might be made to her on that head. By
this the privy counsellors thought themselves fuffi.
ciently authorised to proceed; and prompted, as they
pretended, by zeal for the Queen's safety, or inRfigat.
ed, as is more probable, by the apprehension of the
danger to which they would themselves be exposed,
ifthe life of the Queen of Scots were spared, they
agembled in the Council Chamber; and by a letter
under all their hands, empowered the Earls of
Strewlbury and Kent, together with the High Sheriff
ofthe county, to fee the sentence pufin execution ".

X 00 X On Tuesday the seventh of February, the tw

vii. Earls arrived at Fotheringay, and demanded accci
isO7. to the Queen, read in her presence the warant t
asior execution, and required her to prepare to die net
ruh . morning. Mary heard them to the end without

emotion, and crossing herself in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghof,
O That foul," said Ihe, " is not worthy the joyp
of Heaven, which repines because the body moll

I did not exped that the Queen of England would
set the first example of violating the sacred person td
a Sovereign Prince, I willingly submit to that
which Providence has decreed to be my lot. And
laying her hand on a Bible, which happened to k
near her, The solemnly protested that hfe was inno
cent of that conspiracy which Babington had carrid
on against Elizabeth's life ". She then mentioned
the requests contained in her letter to Elizabeth,
but obtained no fatisfadory answer. She entreatd
with particular earnestness, that now in her ht
moments her Almoner might be suffered to attend
her, and that (he might enjoy the consolation d
those pious inflitutions prescribed by her religion
Even this favor, which is usually granted to th
vilest criminal, was absolutely denied.

Her attendants, during this conversation, wen

bathed in tears, and though overawed by the psi
fence of the iwo Earls, with difficulty fupprefd

bturl out into the most passionate exprelions of VII.
tndernefs and sorrow. lary, however, not only 1ss7.
retained perfea coripofure of mind herself, but
endeavoured to moderate their excessive grief; and
falling on her knees, with all her domeflics round
her, Ihe thanked Heaven that her fufferirigs were
now so near an end, and prayed that fie might be
enabled to endure what still remained with decency
and with fortitude. The greater part of the evening
Ie employed in fettling her worldly affairs. She
wrote her testament with her own hand. Her money,
herjewels, and her clothes, The difiributed among
her fervanto, according to their rank or merit. She
wrote a flort letter to the King of France, and
another to the Duke of Guise, full of tender but
magnanimous sentiments, and recommended her
foul to their prayers, and her afflicted servants to
their protecion. At supper, she eat temperately,
asufual, and converted not oniy with ease, but
with cheerfulness; Ihe drank to every one ofher ser-
vants, and asked their forgiveness, if ever she had
filed in any part of her duty towards them. At her
wonted time the went to bed, and sept calmly a
few hours. Early in the morning the retired into
her closet, and employed a considerable time in
devotion. At eight o'clock the High Sheriff and
his officers entered her chamber, and found her
Rill kneeling at the altar. She immediately tarted
up, and with a majestic mien, and a countenance
undismayed, and even cheerful, advanced towards
the place of execution, leaning on two of Paulet's

AAa3

1 o 0 K attendants. She was dressed in a mourning habit,

vii. but with an elegance and splendor which Ihe had
1'5" long laid aside, except on a few festival days. An

Agnus Dei hung by a pomander chain at her neck;
her beads at her girdle; and in her hand the
carried a crucifix of ivory. At the bottom of the
fairs the two Earls, attended by several gentlemen
from the neighbouring counties, received her;
and there Sir Andrew Melvil., the Mater of her
Hourbold, who had been secluded for sone
weeks from her presence. was permitted to take
his last farewel. At the fight of a Mitrefs whom
he tenderly loved, in such a situation, he melted
into tears; and as he was bewailing her condition,
and complaining of his own hard fate in being
appointed to carry the account of such a mournful
event into Scotland, Mary replied, "Weepnot,
good Melvil, there is at present greater cause for
rejoicing. Thou shalt this day fee Mary Stewart
delivered from all her cares, and such an end put
to her tedious sufferings, as Ihe has long exp8ede
Bear witness that I die constant in my religion;
firm in myfidelity towards Scotland; and unchang
ed in my affetion to France. Commend me to
my son. Tell him I have done nothing injurious
to his kingdom, to his honor, or to his rights;
and God forgive all those who have thirsted,
without cause, for my blood, "

With inmch difficulty, and after many entrea

ties, The prevailed on the two Earls to allow Mel
vil, together with three of her men servants, and
two of her maids, to attend her to the scaffold. It

was ereAed in the fame hall where hfe had been B o ,
tried, raised a little above the floor, and covered, vii.
as well as a chair, the cuhlion, and block, with '157.
black cloth. Mary mounted the Reps with alacrity,
beheld all this apparatus of death with an unaltered
countenance, and figaing herself with the cross, she
fat down in the chair. Beale read the warrant for
execution with a loud voice, to which he listened
with a careless air, and like one occupied in other
thoughts. Then the Dean of Peterborough began a
devout discourse, suitable to her present condition,
and offered up prayers to Heaven in her behalf;
but Ihe declared that The could not in conscience
hearken to the one, nor join with the other; and
kneeling down, repeated a Latin prayer. When
the Dean had finilhed his devotions, she, with an
audible voice, and in the Englilh tongue, recom.
mended unto God the affliced Rate of the Church,
and prayed for prosperity to her son, and for a
long life and peaceable reign to Elizabeth. She
declared that ihe hoped for mercy only through
the death of Christ, at the foot of whose image
ie now willingly Ihed her blood; and lifting up,
and killing the crucifix, fie thus addressed it, "As
thy arms, 0 Jesus, were extended on the Cross;
lo with the outstretched arms of thy mercy receive
me, and forgive my fins."
She then prepared for the block, by taking off her
veil, and upper garments; and one of the execution-
ers rudely endeavouring to aflift, he gently checked
him, and said, with a finile, that The had not been
accustomed to undress before so many fpedators,

Aa4

B 0 K nor to be served by such valets. With calm but
v I. undaunted fortitude, 1he laid her neck on the block;
as37. and while one executioner held her hands, the

other, at the second froke, cut off her head, which
falling out of its attire, discovered her hair already
grown quite grey with cares and sorrows. 'he
executioner held it up still freaming with blood,
and the Dean crying out, a So perilh all Quee
Elizabeth's enemies," the Earl of Kent alone an.
fwered Amen. The reft of the fpedators continoed
silent, and drowned in tears; being incapable, at
that moment, of any other sentiments but tbo
of pity or admiration ".

snti~t Such was the tragical death of Mary Queen c
e*hia ,us Scots, after a life of fortyfour years and two
ae. months, almoRt nineteen years of which Ihe pased

in captivity. The political parties which were formed
in the kingdom, during her reign, have fubfircd
under various denominations, ever since that tim

mated, bath descended to succeeding ages, and thei
prejudices, as well as their rage, have been perp
tuated, and even augmented. Among hiftoria,
who were under the dominion of all these passions
and who have either ascribed to her every virtuos
and amiable quality, or have imputed to her all te
vices, of which the human heart is susceptible, we
search in vain for Mary's real chara4er. She neither
merited the exaggerated praises of the one, nor the
undiftioguilhing censure of the other.

To all the charms of beauty, and the utmolt B o K

Polite, affable, insinuating, sprightly, and capable HtraMAt.
of speaking and of writing with equal ease and
dignity. Sudden, however, and violent in all her
attachments; because her heart was warm and un-
suspicious. Impatient of contradition; because The
had been accustomed from her infancy to be treated
as a Queen. No stranger, on some occasions, to
difimulation; which, in that perfidious court where
le received her education, was reckoned among
the necessary arts of government. Not insensible of
flattery, or unconscious of that pleasure, with which
almoll every woman beholds the influence of her
own beauty. Formed with the qualities which we
love, not with the talents that we admire; lhe was an
agreeable woman, rather than an illustrious Queen.
The vivacity of her spirit not sufficiently tempered
with found judgment, and the warmth of her heart,
which was not, at all times, under the restraint of
discretion, betrayed her both intqerrfrs, and into
crimes. To fay that The was always unfortunate,
will not account for that long and ahno!t uninter-
rupted fucceflion of calamities which besel her; we
mult likewise add, that Ihe was often imprudent.
Her paflion for Darnly was rash, youthful, and
excellive; and though the sudden transition to
the opposite extreme was the natural effed of her
ill.requited love, and of his ingratitude, insolence,
and brutality; yet neither these, nor Bothwelrs
artful address and important services, can justify

o o x her attachment to that nobleman. Even the man
vII. ners of the age, licentious as they were, are n(
"A. apology for this unhappy passion; nor can theq

induce us to look on that tragical and infamow
scene which followed upon it with lels abhorrence
Humanity will draw a veil over this part of he
charater which it cannot approve, and may, pa
haps, prompt some to impute some of her adioni
to her situation, more than to her dispositions
and to lament the unhappiness of the former, rathe
than accuse the perverseness of the latter. Mary'i
lffferings exceed, both in degree and in duration,
those tragical difirelfes which fancy has feigned
to excite sorrow and commiseration; and while we
survey them, we are apt altogether to forget ha
frailties, we think of her faults with less indigna
tion, and approve of our tears, as if they wen
shed for a person who had attained much nearm
to pure virtue.

With regard to the Queen's person, a circumflance

not to be omitted in writing the history of a female
reign, all contemporary authors agree in ascribing
to Mary the utmost beauty of countenance, and
elegance of fbape, of which the human form is
capable. Her hair was black, though, according to
the fashion of that age, Ihefrequently wore borrowed
locks, and of different colors. Her eyes were a
dark grey; her complexion was exquisitely fine;
and her hands and arms remarkably delicate, both
as to fIape and color. Her stature was of a height
that rose to the majestic. She danced, lhe walked,
and rode with equal grace. Her tafe for mOfic wav

juR, and fie both sung and played upon the lute a o O K
with uncommon Ikill. Towards the end of her life, vll.
long confinement, and the coldness of the houses "
in which fle had been imprisoned, brought on a
rheumatism, which often deprived her of the use
of her limbs. No man, fays Brantome, ever beheld
her person without admiration and love, or will
read her history without sorrow.

None of her women were suffered to come near
her dead body, which was carried into a room
adjoining to the place of execution, where it lay, for
some days, covered with a coarse cloth torn from a
billiard table. The block, the scaffold, the aprons
of the executioners, and every thing stained with
her blood, were reduced to alhes. Not long after,
Elizabeth appointed her body to be buried in the
Cathedral of Peterborough with royal magnificence.
But this vulgar artifice was employed in vain; the
pageantry of a pompous funeral did not efface the
memory of those injuries which laid Mary in her
grave. James, soon after his accession to the Eng-
liLt throne, ordered her body to be removed to
UWelminfer- abbey, and to be deposited among
the Monarchs of England.

Elizabeth affected to receive the accounts of Elizabeth rs

Mary's death with the mofl violent emotions of fmct' M^'
surprise and of concern. Sighs, tears, lamentations death.
and mourning, were all employed to display the
reality and greatness of her sorrow. Evident marks
of dillimulation and artifice may be traced through
every period of Elizabeth's proceedings against
the life of the Scottish Queen. The commission for

o0 0 bringing Mary to a public trial was seemingly
VIL extorted from her by the entreaties of her privy
s*r. counsellors. She delayed publilhing the sentence

against her till the was twice solicited by both
Houses of Parliament. Nor did (he sign the warrant
for execution without the utmost apparent relud.
ance. One [cene more of the boldest and molf solemn
deceit remained to be exhibited. She undertook to
make the world believe that Mary had been put to
death without her knowledge, and againt her will.
Davison, who neither fufpetded her intention, nor
his own danger, was her instrument in carrying on
this artifice, and fell a vi&im to it.

It was his duty, as Secretary of State, to lay

before her the warrant for execution, in order to
be signed; and, by her command, he carried it to
the Great Seal. She pretended, however, that Abe
had charged him not to communicate what The had
done to any person, nor to susser the warrant to go
out of his bands, without her express permiflon;

at, in contempt of this order, he had not only

-*vaLed the matter to several of her Ministers, but
had, in concert with them, assembled her Privy
Counselors, by whom, without her content or
knowledge, the warrant was issued, and the Earls
of Sbrewibury and Kent empowered to put it in
execution. Though Davison denied all this, and
with circumstances which bear the strongest marks
of truth and credibility ; though it can scarcely
be conceived that her Privy Council, composed of
the persons in whom lhe most confided, of her
Ministers and favorites, would afferble within the

walls of her palace, and venture to transact a matter B O O X
of so much importance, without her privity, and vI.
contrary to her inclination; yet so far did Ihe carry 187.
her difimu!ation, that, with all the signs of difplea-
sure and of rage, {he banished most of her Coun-
fellors out of her presence; and treated Burleigh,
in particular, so harihly, and with Such marks of
difguRl, that he gave up himself for loft, and in the
deepeR affliction wrote to the Queen, begging leave
to resign all his places,.that he might retire to his
own estate. Davison bhe instantly deprived of his
office, and committed him a close prisoner to the
Tower. He was soon after brought to a solemn My«
trial in the Star Chamber, condemned to pay a
fine of ten thousand pounds, and to be imprisoned
during the Queen's pleasure. He languilbed several
years in confinement, and never recovered any
degree of favor or of power. As her jealousy and
fear had bereaved the Queen of Scots of life, in
order to palliate this part of her conduct Elizabeth
made no scruple of sacrificing the reputation and
happiness of one of the most virtuous and able men
in her kingdom ".
This solemn farce, for it deserves no better name, Elinbeth
furnilhed Elizabeth, however, with an apology to tdode"ou
the King of Scots. As the profpet of his mother's Ahw,
danger had excited the King's filial care and concern,
the account of her death filled him with grief and
resentment. His fubjcets felt the dilhonor done to
him, and to the nation. In order to sooth both,

0 0 Kl Elizabeth inflantly dispatched Robert Carey, one
Vii. of Lord Hunfdon's sons, with a letter exprefling
»s67. her extreme affliAion on account of that miferabe

accident, which, as Ihe pretended, had happenedlr
contrary to her appointment or intention. Jama
would not permit her meflenger to enter Scotland;
and with fotne difficulty received a memorial
which he sent from Berwick. It contained the tak
concerning Davison, dressed up with all the cr.
cumftances which tended to exculpate Elizabeth,
and to throw the whole blame on his ralhneh 0t

English, naturally averse from the dominion of

towards the son; and that, by engaging in a

inheritance, which, by cultivating her friendihip,
he mufl infallibly obtain. These representations,
added to the consciousness of his own weakness,
to the smallness of his revenues, to the mutinous .

of others, and to the influence of that fation

and offered to prove that he was no less accessary
than Gray to the Queen's death, and had even
formed a design of delivering up the King himself
into the hands of the English. But time and absence
bad, in a great measure, extinguilhed the King's
affection for a minion who so little deserved it.
All the courtiers combined against him as a com-
mon enemy; and, instead of gaining his point,
he had the mortification to fee the office of Cban-
cellar conferred upon Maitland, who, together
with that dignity, enjoyed all the power and
influence of a prime minister.

In the Assembly of the Church, which met this
year, the fame hatred to the order of Biflops, and
the fame jealousy and fear of their encroachments,
appeared. But as the King was now of.full age,
and a parliament was summoned on that occasion,
the Clergy remained satisfied with appointing some
of their number to represent their grievances to
that court, from which great things were expected.
Previous to this meeting of Parliament, James The Ring
attempted a work worthy of a King. The deadly attempts to

unite the

studs which subsisted between many of the great nobles.
hmilies, and which were transmitted from one
generation to another, weakened the strength of
te kingdom; contributed, more than any other

the public revenues were not sufficient for defraying vit.
the King's ordinary charges; as the administration itr7.

Wore expensive ; as James was naturally profuse, ;hurbhland,.
and a stranger to economy; it was necessary, on
all these accounts, to provide some fund propor-
tioned to his exigencies. But no considerable fum
could be levied on the Commons, who did not
¢ejoy the benefit of an extensive commerce. The
nobles were unaccustomed to bear the burden of
heavy taxes. The revenues of the Church were
the only source whence a proper supply could be
drawn. Notwithrtanding all the depredations of the
laity lince the Reformation, and the various devices
which they had employed to seize the Church.lands,
some considerable portion of them remained fill
unalienated, and were held either by the Bilhops
who possessed the benefices, or were granted to lay.
men during pleasure. All these lands were, in this
parliament, annexed, by one general law ", to the
Crown, and the King was empowered to apply the
rents of them to his own use. The tithes alone
were reserved for the maintenance of the persons
who served the cure, and the principal manfion-houfe,
with a few acres of land, by way of glebe, allotted
for their residence. By this great acceflion of pro.
perty, it is natural to conclude that the King muff
have acquired a vast increase of power, and the
influence of the nobles have suffered a proportional

his whole reign, he was continually employed i

proprietors thcmfelves, or parcelled out by the
Prince, or split by other accidents. The number of
Feeholders became greater, and their condition
aore unequal: betides the ancient Barons, who
preferred their estates and their power unimpaired,
there arose another order, whose rights were the

Proteflant Biflops, an indigent race of men, an
odious to the nation, were far from poffelling thd
weight and credit which their predecessors derivei
rom their own exorbitant wealth, and the supec
ftitious reverence of the people. In this situation

1Tst. The year one thousand five hundred and ciglity

·r t , eigha t began with an universal expectation through,
rmado. out all Europe, that it was to be diftinguilhid

by wouderful events and revolutions. Several
afrologers, according to the accounts of contce
porary biltoriarL, badt prediced this; and the
fiuauoo of affaiis in the two principal kingdoms

of Europe was such, that a sagacious observer, BOO l
without any supernatural intelligence, might have vil.
hazarded the predition, and have forefcen the 118. '
approach offome grand crisis. In France, it was
evidecnt from the aftonilhing progress of the league,
conduded by a leader whose ambition was restrain-
ed by no scruples, and whose genius had hitherto
surmounted all difficulties; as well as from the
timid, variable, and impolitic councils of Henry 111.
that either that Monarch must submit to abandon
the throne, of which he was unworthy; or by
some sudden and daring blow cut off his formi-
dable rival. Accordingly, in the beginning of the
year, the Duke of Guise droie his Master out of
his capital city, and forced him to conclude a
peace, which left him only the shadow of royalty;
and before the year expired, he himself fell a vidtim
to the resentment and fear of Henry, and to his
own security. In Spain, the operations were such
a, promircd something fill more uncommon. Dur-
ing three years, Philip had employed all the power
of his European dominions, and exhausted the
treasures of the Indies, in vast preparations for war.
A fleet, the greatest that had ever appeared in the
nean, was ready to fail from Lisbon, and a nu-
merous land.army was assembled to embark on
board of it. Its destination was still unknown,
though many circumfrances made it probable that
the blow was aimed, in the first place, against
,gl.hno. Elizabeth had long given secret aid
to the revolted provinces in the Low Countries,
and now openly afforded them her protection. A

B O 0 x numerous body of her troops was in their service

viz. the Earl of Leicefer commanded their armies; fln
sha had great sway in the civil government of thi

Republic; and some of its molt :onfiderable town,
were ir. her poffeflion. Her fleets had insulted thl
coasts f Spain, intercepted the galleons from thi
Weft Indies, and threatened the colonies there
Roused by so many injuries, allured by views o
ambition, and animated by a superstitious zeal 0so
propagating the Romilh religion, Philip resolved
not only to invade, but to conquer England, tt
which his descent from the honfe of LancaRfer, and
the donation of Pope Sixtus V. gave him, in hi
own opinion, a double title.

Coaduct of Elizabeth saw the dabger approach, and prepared
tJhmt "o to encounter it. The measures for the defence ol
t_·at o0Ci
,o.. her kingdom were concerted and carried on with

the wisdom and vigor which diftinguilfed her reign.
Her chief care was to secure the friendfbip of the
King of Scots. She had treated the Queen his mother
with a rigor unknown among Princes; she had often
used himself harshly, and with contempt; and
though be bad hitherto prudently suppressed his
rcfentment of there injuries, she did not believe it
to be altogether extinguilbed, and was afraid that,
in her prtfent situation, it might burst out with a
fatal violence. Philip, fenfiblc bow much an
alliance with Scotland would facilitate his enter.
pri.-. courted James with the utmost afiduity. He
excited him to revenge his Mother's wrong; he
flattered him with the hopes of Iharing his con-
quests; and offered him in marriage his daughter

the Infanta Isabella. At the fame time, Scotland B o K
wvarmed with priests, his emissaries, who seduced vil.
tome of the nobles to Popery, and corrupted others 8.
with bribes and promises. Huntly, Errol, Crawford,
were the heads of a facion, which openly espoused
the interest of Spain. Lord Maxwell, arriving from
that court, began to assemble his followers, and to
take arms, that he might be ready to join the
Spaniards. In order to counterbalance all these,
Elizabeth made the warmest profeflions of friend.
flil to the King; and Alhby, her Ambassador,
entertained him with magnificent hopes and promi-
fes. He assured him that his right of fucceflion to
the Crown should be publicly acknowledged in
England; that he should be created a Duke in
that kingdom; that he ihould be admitted to some
flare in the government; and receive a confider-
,b!e pe::fion annually. James, it is probable, was
too well acquainted with Elizabeth's arts, to rely
entirely on these promises. But he understood his
own interest in the prefentjundure, and pursued it
wirh much steadiness. He rejected an alliance with
Spain, as dangerous. He refused to admit into his
prf:nce an ambaffdor from the Pope. He seized
Colonel Semple, an agent of the Prince of Parma.
He drove many of the seminary Priests out of the
kin.dom. He marched suddenly to Dumfries, dif-
perfed Maxwell's followers, and took him prisoner.
In a Convention of the nobles he declared his
re[nlution to adhere inviolably to the league with
Eigliand; and, without listening to the fuggefions
ol revenge, determined to aft in concert with

100 K Elizabeth, againr the common enemy of the Pro.

VIL teftant faith. He put the kingdom in a poture of
w"I' defence, and levied troops to obftrud the landing

of the Spaniards. He offered to fend an army to
Elizabeth's afliftance, and told her Ambassador, that
he expeced no other favor from the King of Spain,
but that which Polyphemus bad promised to Ulysses,
that when he had devoured all his companions, he
would make him his last morsel".

A *ithual The zeal of the people, on this occasion, was not
_',¶"'' inferior to that of the King; and the extraordinary
Iigai. danger, with which they were threatened, fuggefied

to them an extraordinary expedient for their security.
A bond was framed for the maintenance of true
religion, as well as the defence of the King's per.
son and government, in opposition to all enemies,
foreign and domestic. This contained a confellion
of the Protestant faith, a particular renunciation of
the errors of Popery, and the mos solemn promises,
in the name, and through the Rrength of God, of
adhering to each other in supporting the former,
and contending against the latter, to the utmost of
their power ". The King, the Nobles, the Clergy and
the people subscribed with equal alacrity. Strange or
uncommon as such a combination may now appear,
many circumstances contributed, at that ti.e, to
recommend it, and to render the idea familiar to
the Scots. When roused by any extraordinary event,
or alarmed by any public danger, the people of

" Camd. (44 Johnft. i9. Spotfw. ;69.

Israel were accustomed to' bind themselves, by a 1 o oK
solemn covenant, to adhere to that religion which 7ll.
the Almighty had eftablilbed among them; this 'L$
the Scots confidered as a sacred precedent, which
it became them to imitate. In that age no confider.
able enterprise was undertaken in Scotland, with.
out a bond of mutual defence, which all concerned
reckoned necelfary for their security. The form of
this religious confederacy is plainly borrowed from
those political ones, of which so many infances
have occurred; the articles, stipulations, and pecu-
liar modes of exprellion, are exactly the fame in
both. Almost all the considerable Popish Princes
were then joined in a league for extirpating the
Reformed Religion, and nothing could be more
natural, or seemed more efficacious, than to enter
into a counter-affociation, in order to oppose the
progress of that formidable conspiracy. To these
caulfs did the Covenant, which is become so famous
in hiflory, owe its origin. It was renewed at
different times during the reign of James '. It
was revived with great solemnity, though with
considerable alterations, in the year one thousand
fix hundred and thirty-eight. It was adopted by
the lEnglifh in the year one thousand fix hundred
and forty-three, and enforced by the civil and eccle.
fiafical authority of both kingdoms. Thepolitical
purposes to which it was then made subservient,
and the violent and unconstitutional measures which
it was then employed to promote, it is not our
plovince to explain. But at the jundure in which it

Cald. iv. 129.

BOO K was firR introduced, we may pronounce it to

viI. have been a prudent and laudable device for the
ss.m defence of the religion and liberties of the nation,

nor were the terms in which it was conceived,
other than might have been expected from men
alarmed with the impending danger of Popery,
and threatened with an invasion by the most bigoted
and most powerful Prince in Europe.

Philip's eagerness to conquer England did cot

inspire him either with the vigor or dispatch necel
fary to ensure the success of so mighty an enterprise.
His fleet, which ought to have failed in April, did
not enter the Englilh channel till the middle of July.
It hovered many days on the coast, in expetation
of being joined by the Prince of Parma, who was
blocked up in the ports of Slanders by a Dutch

Toe Aaado squadron. Continual disasters pursued the Spani.
W oL tt* aards during that time; successive storms and battles,

which are well known, conspired with their own
ill conduc to disappoint their enterprise. And, by
the blefling of Providence, which watched with
remarkable care over the Proteflant Religion and
the liberties of Britain, the Englilh valor scattered
and destroyed the Armado, on which Philip had
arrogantly beflowed the name of Invincible. After
being driven out of the English seas, their Ihatttred
ships were forced to fleer their course towards
Spain, round Scotland and Ireland. Many of them
suffered shipwreck on these dangerous and unknown
coasts. Though James kept his fubjeas under arms,
to watch the motions of the Spaniards, and to pre.
vent their landing in a hostile manner, he received

with great humanity seven hundred who were BO K
forced alhore by a tempest, and after supplying vII.
them with necessaries, permitted them to return isi.
into their own country.

On the retreat of the Spaniards, Elizabeth sent
an ambassador to congratulate with James, and to
compliment him on the firmness and generosity he
had discovered during a conjuncture so dangerous.
But none of Alhby's promises were any longer
remembered; that Minister was even accused of
having exceeded his powers, by his too liberal
ofters; and conscious of his own fallhood, or
alhamed of being disowned by his court, he with-
drew secretly out of Scotland ".

and to adopt the plan which the Princes of Lorrain
had long meditated, of invading England through
Scotland. A body of his troops, he imagined, might
be easily wafted over from the Low Countries to
that kingdom, and if they could once obtain footing,
or procure affifance there, the frontier of England
was open and defenceless, and the northern counties
full of Roman Catholics, who would receive them
with open arms. Meanwhile, a descent might be
threatened on the southern coast, which would divide

oo the Englilf army, diftrad their councils, and
vu. throw the whole kingdom into terrible convulsions
"*. In order to prepare the way for the execution of

this design, he remitted a considerable fum of
money to Bruce, a seminary. priest in iScotland,
and employed him, together with Hay, Creigh.
too, and Tyrie, Scottili Jcfuits, to gain over as
many persons of diftindion as poflfible to his in.

Pisko. teret. Zeal for Popery, and the artful insinuations
f,, f,,nof these emissaries, induced several noblemen to
the Ki. favor a meafurc which tended so manifeltly to the

defruction of their country. Huntly, though the
King had lately given him in marriage the daughter
of his favorite the Duke of Lenox, continued
warmly attached to the Romilh Church. Crawford
and Errol were animated with the zeal of new
converts. They all engaged in a correspondence
with the Prince of Parma, and, in their letters to
him, offered their service to the King of Spain, and
undertook, with the aid of fix thousand men, to
reader him master of Scotland, and to bring so
many of their vassals into the field, that he leould
be able to enter England with a numerous army.
Francis Stewart, grandson of James V. ", whom
the King had created Earl of Bothwell, though
influenced by no motive of religion, for he fill
adhered to the Protestant faith, was prompted
merely by caprice, and the refleffnefs of his nature,
to join in this treasonable correspondence.

" He was the son of John Prior, of Coldingham, one
of Jmes' natural children.

All these letters were intercepted in England. B O
Elizabeth, alarmed at the danger which threatened vll.
her own kingdom, sent them immediately to the 's89.
King, and reproaching him with his former lenity Feb.7.
towards the Popilh party, called upon him to check
this formidable conspiracy by a proper severity. But The Kingr
James, though firmly attached to the Protestant maims,
religion, though profoundly versed in the theological to peoy.
controversies between the Reformers and the Church
of Rome, though he had employed himself, at that
early period of life, in writing a Commentary on
the Revelations, in which he labored to prove the
Pope to be Antichrist, had nevertheless adopted,
already, those maxims concerning the treatment of
the Roman Catholics, to which he adhered through
the reft of his life. The Roman Catholics were at
that time a powerful and acive party in England;
they were far from being an inconsiderable fatdioa
in his own kingdom. The Pope and King of Spain
were ready to take part in all their machinations,
and to second every effort of their bigotry. The
opposition of such a body to his fucceflion to the
Crown of England, added to the iaverfenefs of
the English from the government of strangers,
might create him many difficulties. In order to
avoid these, he thought it neceflary to sooth, ra.
ther than to irritate the Roman Catholics, and to
reconcile them to his fuccefion, by the hopes of
gentler treatment, and some mitigation of the
rigor of those laws, which were now in force
against them. This attempt to gain one party by
promises of indulgence and adt of cdmeacy,

B o o K while he adhered with all the obfinacy of a diP

vet. putant to the doctrines and tenets of the other,
1ss9. has given an air of mystery, and even of contra.

didion, to this part of the King's charater. The
Papiits, with the credulity of a fed struggling to
obtain power, believed his heart to be wholly
theirs; and the Protestants, with the jealousy in.
separable from thole who are already in possession
of power, viewed every at of lenity as a mark
of indifference, or a symptom of apoftacy. In
order to please both, James often aimed at an
exceflive refinement, mingled with diflimulation,
in which he imagined the perfedion of govern.
mert and of king-craft to conift.

,, exC His behaviour on this occasion was agreeable to

i-"e ki these general maxims. Notwithstanding the solicit.
§iaats. ations of the Queen of England, enforced by the

zealous remonstrances of his own Clergy, a fbort
imprisonment was the only punilhment he infiiced
upon Huntly and his afrociates. But he soon had
reason to repent an at of clemency so inconsistent
with the dignity of government. The first uifewhich
the conspirators made of their liberty, was to
assemble their followers, and, under pretence of
removing Chancellor Maitland, an able Minister,
but warmly devoted to the Englilh interest, from
the King's councils and presence, they attempted to
seize James himself. This attempt being defeated,
partly by Maitland's vigilance, and partly by their
own illcoodut, they were forced to retire to the
North, where they openly erected the standard of
rebellion. But as the King's government was not

generally

generally unpopular, or his ministers odious, their B o o R
ownl v.if.is joined them slowly, and discovered no vii.
ze.l in the cause. The King, in person, advancing s'09.
adinft them with such forces as he could suddenly
levy, they durst not rely so much on the fidelity
of tie troops, which, though superior in number,
followed them with relucance, as to hazard a battle;
butfuffcring them to disperse, they surrendered to the
King, and threw themselves on his mercy. Huntly,
Errol, Crawford, and Bothwell, were all brought
toa public trial. Repeated ads of treason were easily
proved againl them. The King., however, did not
permit any sentence to be pronounced; and, after
keeping them a few months in confinement, he
took occasion, amidst the public festivity and
rejoicings at the approach of his marriage, to set
them at liberty "

As James was the only descendant of the ancient The Iing',
llonarchs of Scotland, in the direct line; as all with'a ne
hopes of uniting the crowns of the two kingdoms ot UDemaLk.
would have expired with him; as the Earl of Arran,
the prefuimptive heir to the throne, was lunatic;
