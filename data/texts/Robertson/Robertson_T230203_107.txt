to our desire of informration, The uni-
veral, progress of fc~iene, djuringd the: two
last centuries , the art of printing , and
other obvious causes, have filled Europe
with s~uch a multiplicity of hiflories, and
with, such vast colleaions of hiflorical
mnaterials, that the term Of human lif is

too i-hort for the fludy or even the pern-

the h-iffory of the Emperor CHARLES Vp
·It was during his admjiniffration that the
powers of Europe were formed into one
great political yft~em, in which each took~
a flation, wherein it has. since remained
w~ith less~ variation, than could have been
expeaed. after the shocks oced~ioned by
so many internal revolutions, .and to
many foreig-n wars. The great. events
which happened then have not hitherto
[pent their force. The political principles
and maxims, thhen eftablilhed, itill contis
nui: to. operate. The ideas concerning
the balance of power, then introduced
or rendered general, t~ill influence the
c~ouncdls of nations.

THRE age Of CHARLES V, may ·therefore

be; considered as the period at~ which the
political slate of .Europe~ began to afihmen
a nlew form. I have ende~avoured to r~en,-
der my account of it,, an introduaion
to the hiffory of .Europe f~ubfequpe~t- e

his reign. While his numerous Biogra-
phers deferibe his perfbnal qualities and
26tions; while the hiflorians ofE diff~erent
countries relate occurrences, the confe-
quences of whtich were l~ocal or tr~ansient,
it hath been my p~urpos~e to re coal· only
those great tranfa~ions in his reign, the,
effea~s of which were universa~l, or con-
tinue 2o be permanent.

As my readers could derive little in-

ftruaion form fa~ch a hiffory of the reign
of CHARLEs V. waithout some info~rmationa
concerning the slate of: Europe previous
to the sixteenth century , my de fire- of
supplying this has produced a preliminary
volume, in which I have attempted to
point out and explain the great caules
and events, to whose operation all the
improvements in~ the political slate of
3Europe, from the f~ubverflon of the Ro-
man Em~pire to the beginning of the
sixteenth century, auft~ be alcribed.I

have exhibited a view of the progress of
[o~ciety in Europe, not only with ref~pe~k
to interior governmnents, laws, and man7
ners, but with refpeik to the conunand
of the national force requisite in foreigva
operations.; and I have deferibed the poi
litical Iconflitution of the principal slates
in Europe at the tim~e when Charles V.
began his· reign.

IN this part of mly work I have been

led into several ' ritical dif~quifitions,
which belong more properly to the pro-
vince of thpe lawyer or antiquary, than
to that of the hiff~orian. These I have
placed at the end of timpt firlt volume
un~der the title of Proofs an~d Illuffrations.
~1Vany of my readers will, probably, give:
little attention to fazch researches. Tof~ome
they may, perhaps, appear the most cu~-
rious and interesting part of the work.
I have carefully pointed out the fburces
from which I have derived inflormation,)

and have cited the writ~ers on whol~e aun
thority I rely with a minute exaatnels
which might appear to border upon often-,
tatio·cn, if ·it- were poilible to be vain of"
having read books, many of which n~o
thing but the diut~y of examining with
accuracy wrhatever I laid before the Pu-
bclic, would have induced me to open. As
my inqluiries conduaed me often into paths
which were ablcure or little frequented,
such co~nstant recourse to the authors who
have been my <r~uldes, was not only ne-
c~effary for authentic~ating the-fas wnh~ich are
th~e foundatilots ofiy~ reasonings, but ·may
be useful in pointing out th~e way. to fa~ch
as Ehall hereafter hold the ame course,
;andi in enabipg~ them to carry on teheir:
r~efeacrhes with greater facility- and fiuccefsg

EvERY intelligent readler will observe

one omillion in my work, the reason of
which it -is necessary to explain. I have
given~ no acc~ount :of the congueftsi of

M~exico and Peru, or of the eftablifhlment
of the Spanish colonies in the continent
and iflandso of America. The: hiffory of
tyhef~e events 5 originally intended to have
related at lconfiderable length. B~lut uport
a nearer and more attentive consideration
of this part of my plati, I found that,
the discovery of the new world; the filate
of society amocng; its anci~ent- inhabitants;
their charafter, manners, and arts; thre
genius of the European settlements in its
various prayinc~es; rogether with the in-
fluentce of these upon the iyfterus of policy
or comrmerce: in ~Europte, wave flbjecas to
fgpendid and islportan~t, that a su~perfic~ial
yiewv of thern could Affrd little facisfaz~tion;
t~o creat of them as -extensively as they me-
rited, meft prelucee an .episode, difpro-
portionate to the principal work. I have
therefore yeferved thefie 'for a s~eparate
history; which, iif the performance
now offered to the Publick [Chall receive

its approbation, I propose to under:
tak e.

Tuotes, by omitfing such considerable

but detached ·artiles in the reign of~
Charles V. I have circumscribed my nar-
r ation within more nar row lim~its , I am~
yet perfunded, from this vi~w: of the ine·
tendion and nature ,f -the work which 'I
thought it necefik-y' 'to lay before myp
r~ea~ders, that.the plan axuf fill appear to.
them too extenrfive, and the undertaking
too arduous. I havle often felt themn to
be so. Burt my conrvi~tion of the utility
of ufac a hifkony prompted mte to perse-
vere. With what facefs ~I have execue-
ed tit the Pubilikt muff now ludge. I
wait, in s~olicitude, for Its deciffen; to

The c~effes of the Roman power on the itate of Europe.

the fabverflon of the Roman Empire, When
~the spirit of conquett led the armies of Rome
beyond ~the Alps, they found all the countries,
tvhich they invadedl inhabited by people whom
they denomninated barbarians , but who were
areverthelef~s brave and indepehdentr. Thfee de-
fended their ancient poffefflions with obstinate
vralour. It was by the iitperiority of their dif-
cipline, rather than of their courage , that the
Romans gaained -any adauntage over them. A
dingle 6a~ttle did not, as among the effeminate:
inhabitants of Asia, decide the fate of a fitte.
The vanquished people refurned their arms with
freth~ spirit, and theii- indisc~iplined~ vatlour, ani-
anated by the love of liberSty supplied the want
of conduft; as well .·as of union.

T'he desolation w~hiL!h it occa~oned.

1)uaritig· those long and fierce struggles forf

~dominion or ~indepen~dence , the countries of
Europe were, faccediively laid waf-e , a gerett
part of their inhabitatis perished in the field,
many . were carried into slavery, and a feeble
remitaht, incapable of 'furth~er refiftane , f~b~
mitted to the Roman p-ower.

'i'he rmprovements Which it intorouced.i

'The Romians having thus desolated Eurolpe,

fCet themselves to civilize it; The form of go-
vernment which they established in the conquer-
ed provinces, though s~evere, was regular, and

prefberved publick tranquillity. As a cons~olation
for the loss of lib'erty, they communicated their
arts, fciencesj langruage, and manners, to their
i2ew faubjeats. Eu~rope beg~an to breathe, and,
to recover firength after the c~alamities which
it had undergrone; ' agricult~fure Fwas encouraged;
population increased; ruined cities were rebuilt;
:new towns were founded ; an appearance of
prosperity fuzcceeded, and repaired, in some dec
gr~ee, the havock of war.

The bad conse~quences of their dlominioir;

This state, hrowever, was fa~r from beinge

flappy , or favourable to the improvement of
the human mind. The vanquifEhed itations~ were
difairmned by their conqcue~rors, and overawedE by
soldiers kept in pay to reitrain them. Tihey
were given up as9 a prey to rapacious governors,
who plundered th~em with impunlity; and were
·drained of their wealth by exorbitant taxes ,
impos~ed with to little attention to the situation
of the provinces , that the impositions were
often increase~d in proportion to their inability-
to fixpport them. .They were deprived of their
most enterprizing citizens, who -resorted to a
distant capital in quest of preferment , or of
ric-h~es; and were accuff·omed in all their a~tions
to look up to a faperior, - and tamely to receive
his commands. Under fb rixany deprefling· cir-
·cumitances, it: was impossibl~e that they couki2
retain vigour or .g~enerosity of mind, The rear-

ilal and 'independent f'pi~tit, which had & ifin-·

~uilfhed their anceffors, beeame extin&t among·
all the people fhubje~fed to the Roman yoke;
they loft not only the habit: but even the capa-
tcity of deciding· for themselves , or of a~ting
rfrom the im~pulse of their own minds; and the
dom~inion of the Romans,* like that of all great
Empires, degraded and debased the human f~e;
eies. A)

The irrttiption of the barbarous nations,

A Society In this slate could not: fh~bfit

long. There were defeats in the Romnan go-·
vernmrent, even in its most perfet form, which
threatened its difftolultion. Timne ripened thele
original feeds of corruption, and g~ave birth to
~many new difCorders. A conftituktion, unfb~und,·
and worn out , must have fallen in pieces of
itself withiout any external thhock. The violent
3rtuption of the Goths , Vandals , Huns , and
other barbarians .hafrened this event, and pre-
cipitated the downfal of the Empire. New nai
·tions seemed to a'r~ie, and to rush from unkriowyn
regions, in order to take vengeance on the Roi
rnans for the calamities which they had infiated
oz mankalind. There fi~erce tribes either inhabit~-
ed the various provinces in Germany, which
had never been fatbdhed by the Romaans, or
were scatt~ered over t~he vast countrie's in the

north of Europe, and north-west of Affa, which
are now occupied by thle Danes, thre Swedes,
·the Poles , the f~ubjetrts of the Rufiran Empire,
and the Tartars. T'heir condit-ion., and tranfr-
a~ions, previous to their invasion of the Em-
pire, are but littl~e krnown. ' All our informa-
tion with refpe~t to these is derived from the
Romans; and as they didl not penetrate far into
counrtries which wvere at: that time uncultcivate'
and uninviting , the accounts of their original
slate given by them are extremely imperfe&,
The rude inhabitants themselves , destitute of
fbcience , and of records , witehout leis~ure , or
curiosity to inquire into remote events, retained,
perhaps, fbme indiftinB memory of recent oc-
currences , but beyond the~e , all was buried
in obhtvlon , or involved in darknefa i and in
fhblle. B)

.State of the countries from which they iffuzed.

The prodigious fwrarms wvhich pouzred in

upon the Em~pire from the beginning of th~e
fourth century to the ~final extin~ion of the
Roman powuer, have g~iven rife to an op:iniona
that the countries .whence they ifi~ued wlere;
crowded with i~nhabitants; and various theories
ha~ve been form~ed to ac~count for s~uch an extra-
ordinary degree of population as hath procured
these countries the apgellatiod of the Storehoufq.

B) N~ote ii.

*of Nations. B6ut: if w~e confider, that th~e counh-

tries poffeflfed by the people wCho invaded the
Empire were of vast extent; that a great part
Sos there was covered with woods and ruert~hes ;
thats some of ~the most: considerable of the bar-
barous nations faubfifted entirely b~y hun~ting or
pafluragre, in both which states of s~ociety large
tradts of land are required for maintaining a few
inhabitants; and that allt of them were firan-
gers to the ar~ts: and induffry, without which
population cannot increase to any great degree,
it is evident, that t~here countries could not be
to populous in ancient times as they are at pre-
sent, when they still contrinue to be lefLs peopled
than any other part of Europ~e or of Asia.

4,But if these circumffances prevented. the
barbarous nations from becoming populous, they
contributed to inspire c', or to fkrengthen, the
martial spirit by which they were difl-ingusifhed.
Inured by the rigour of their climate, or the
poverty of their foil, to hardhips which ren-
dered their bodies firm, and their minds vig~o-
rous; accuffomed to a course of life which was
a continual preparation for affion; and disd~ain-
ing every occupation but that of war ; they
undertook , and prosecuted their military enteir-
prizes with an ardour and impetuosity, of which
menr softened by the refinlements of more 'polit~h-
ed. times can ear~cely form any idea. C)

G) Note IIL,

Th~e moatives of thieir first excurflons.

Their first inroad~rs into the Empire proceed,.

ed rathrer from the love of plunder, than from
the desire of newr settlements. Ronfed to arms
by some enter~pri2;ing or populatr leader, th~ey
sallied out of their forests; broke in upon ther
frontier provinces with irresistible violence; put
all who opposed them to the tCword; carried of
the most valuable effctss of the inhabitantsg
dragged along multitudes of itaptives in chains;
waited all before them with fire or fw~cord; and
returned iia triumph to their wilds and faftneffes.
Their fuzccefs, together with the accounts which
they gave of the unknown conveniencies and
luxiuries ~that abounded in countries better culti-
vated , or blel'ied with a milder climate than
th~eir own , excited new ad~venturers , and
exposed the frontier to new devastations.

Their reasons for fettlin~g inl thle couptries wvhich- they con-

quered.

W~hen nothing was left to plunder in the

adjacent provinces, ravaged by frequent excur-
signs, they marched fa~rther from home , and
finding it difficult , or dangeroqus to ret~urn,
they began to fettle in the countries which t'hey
had facbdued. The su~dden %nd f~bor~t excurilons
in quest of booty , wyhich had alarmed and dif-
quieted the Empire, ceas~ed; a more dreadful
calamity impenlded. Grreat bodies of armed men
with th~eir wives and children, sand. slaves an4-

flocks, iff'ued forth , like regular. colonies, ini
quest of new settlements. People who had no
eit'ies, and s~eldom any fixed habitation, were
Ib little attach-ed to their native foil, that they
migrated without relujdance from one place to
Eanother. Newr adven-turers followed ~themJ. JThe
landis which they delberted were occupied by
.more remote tribes of barbarians,

IThe ext~ent of their fettlemients.

T'hefe, in their turn, pushed forward into·

mnore fertile countries, and, Itke a torrent co~n-
tinually increat~ng;, rolled on , and twept every
thing before them. In less than two centuries
from their first irruption, barbarians of various
names and lineage, plandered and took posses-~
sion of Thrace , Pannonia, Gaul, Spain, Af~ri-
ca, and at laftof Itly, and Rome itself. The
vast fabrick of the Rgomanl power , which it had.
been the work of ages to perfelt~, was in tchat
thort period overturned- from thie foundation.

The circomftances Which occaiioned the downfall of the Roman

Empire.

1Wany concurring causes prepared the way

for this great revolution , and enfurled s~uccess
to the nations which invaded the Empire. The
RPoman comrmonwealtth had conquered the worrd
by the wisdom of its civil maxims, and the ri-
gour of its military discipline. But under the
Emnperors, the former were forgotten or defpif~

ed, and the latter was gradually rel.axed. The
armies, of thEe Empire in the fourth and fifth
centuries 'bore fearcely a.ny resemblance to thlofe
invincible legions which had been vi~torious
wherever they marched. Inficad- of freemnen,
who vo~luntarily to~k. arms from the love of
g-loryr, or of their country, provincials and bar-
barians were bribed or forced into service. They
wvere too feeble , or too proud to s~ubmit to the
fatigue of military duty. They even complain*
ed of the weight of their defensive armour as
intolerable, and laida it asi~de. Infantry , from
w~hich the armiecs of ancient Rome derited their
vigour and itability , fell into contemtpt-; the
e~ffminate and undifcipliined soldiers of later ti-
Imes could h-ardly be brought: to venture into
the field but on horseback. ·'There wretched
troops, however, were thie onlyr guardiatns of
th~e Empire. . Thte jealouiry of defyo~tifmn~ had de-
prived the people of the use of arms; and fab-
jeafs, oppress~ed and rendered incapable of de-
sending t~hemnfelves, had neither spirit nor incli-
nation to resist their invaders, from whom they
had little to fear, because their condition could
hardly be rendered more unhappy. A-s the
martial piErit became extina , the revenues
of the Empire gradually diminif'hed. The
taste for the luxuries of t~he East increased
to such a pitch in the Im~perial court , that:
great ftms were carried into India , from
which money never returns. By the vraft sub-

fidies paid to the barbarous nations, a flill grea-t-
er qu~antityr of species was withdrawn from cir-
caulation. The frontier: pfiovinces , waitLed by
frequent incurflons, became unable to pay ' the
customary tribut~e; and the wealth of the
wrorld ,which had long centered in the capita;.
of the Empire, cedied to flow thither in the fame
abundance, or w;tas diverted int~o other channels.
The limits ·of the empire continued to be as ex-
tensive as ever, while the fpIirsit requisite for Its
defence declined, ·and its -resources w~ere exhauft--r
ed. A vast body, lan~guid , and almost unani-
mated, became incapable of any effort to s~ave
itself, and was easily overpowered. The Em-
perors, who had the absolute dire~tion of this
disordered f'yftem, funk in the foftners of ea-
flern luxury, ifhut up within the walls of a pa,
lace, ignorant of war, unacquainted wtit~h as-
fairs, and g~overned entirely by women and eu-
nuchs, or by minidters equally effeminate, trem-
bled at the approach of danger, and, under cir-.
cumftances which called for the utmoilt vig~our
in counsel as wyell as in actcion, discovered all
the impotent irresolution of fear, and of fo~lly

The circurntances which contribulted to thle ruccefs of the bart

barous na tionus.

In every refpe~t, the condition of; the barba-

rous nationls was th~e reverse of that of the Ro-
mans. Among them, the martial spirit was in
~full vigourr; their leaders were hardy and. enr
terprizing ; the arts which had enervated the

Romans were unknown am~ong them; and sauch
was the nature of their military institutions,
that thecy broug~ht forces into th& field without
any trouble, and s~upported them at little ex-
pence. The mercenary and effeminate troops
itationed on the frontier, affonifhed at
their fierceness, either fled at their ap-
proach, or were routed in the sirs onset.
The feeble expedient to wh~ich the Emperors
had recourse, of taking· larges bodies of the
barbarians into pay, and of empl~oying them to
repel new invaders, instead of retardingr, ha-

soon tnured their arms a gainft their masters ,
and wich greater advanltage than ever ; for, b~y
serving inl the Rom~an armies, they had acquir-
ed all the dis~cipline, or fkrill in war, which
the Romnans still retained ; and, upon adding
there to their native feroc~ity, they became
altogether irresistible.

. The spirit with wich they carried on war.

But though from thes~e, and many other

causes, the progress and conquefls of the na-
tions which over-ran the Empire became to
extremely rapid, they were accompanied with
horrible devaffations, and an incredible deficuc-
tion of the human fjocies. Civilized nations
which ftae arms upon cool refl~e~tion, from mo-
tives of policy pr prudence, with a view to
guard ag~ainst s~ome distant danger, or to pre-

vent fomne remote contingency, carry on their
be~ftilities wiJith to~ little rancour or anlim~ofiy,
that war among: them is disar~med of half its
terrors. Barbarians are firangers to fai~ch refi-
mements. They rush into war with impetuo-
fity, and -profercute it .with violence. Their
fiole obje't is to makre thei'r enemies feel the·
weighit of their vengeance; nor does their' rage
s~ubside until it be s~atiated with infiding on
them every poilible calamity.' It is with fach
a fpirit~that -the savage tribes in America carry~
on their petty wars. It was with the fame
spirit that the more powerful and no less fierce
barbarians in the north of Europe, and of Asia,
fell upo-n the Roman Empire,

Wrhat es~caped the fury of the first inundation,

vaders, self defence vi~as· their chief care, and

institutions and policyli Infeadof thof l~oose
afl'otiat~ions, wvhich, though they fecarcely dimi-
nithed their personal independence, had been
fuzfficient for their security while they remained
in their original countries, they saw the, necef-
iity of confederating more clos~ely together, -and
of relinquis~hing some of their private rights in
order to attain public safety. Every freeman,
upon receiving a portion of the lands which
were divided, bound himself to q~ppear in arms
against the enemies of the community. This
military service was the condition upon which
he received and held his lands; and as they were
exempted from every other b~urden, that te-

nure, among a wa~irlike people, was deemed both
eaijy and honouraible. The King or general, who
led them to conquest, conrtinuing still to be the
head of the~ co~lony, had, of? course, the larg~est
portion allotted to him. Having thus acquired
the means of rewarding~ past fCervices, as well
as of gaining new adherents, he parcelled out
his l~ands with this view, -bindings thos~e on whom
they were. bess owed, to follow his ffandard with
a number of men in proportion to the extenat of
the territory which they received, and to bear
arms in his defence. His chief ofificers, imitated
the example of the s~overeign, and, in diffribut-
ing . portions of their lands among -th eir depeti-
dents, annexed the f~ame condition to the grantr.
Thus a 'feudal hingdom refCembled a military
eftablliihment, rather than a civil inftitxtion. The
vi~torious army, .cantoned out: in the country
wthich it had: seiz~ed, continued ranged under its
proper officers, and s~ubordinate to military coma-
mand. The names of a soldier and of a frlee-
man were synonymous. d) Every proprietor

able. The monarchical and ariff ioeratical parts
of the conftittition, having to interm~ediate p~o-
Aver to balance them, were perpetually~ at v~a-
fiance, and jti~ftling· with each othe~r. The po-
wverful vassals of the crowvn s~oon e-xtorte~d a
confirmation for life of those grants of landi
wi;hich being at firs~t purely gratuitous, had beenz
bestowed only during pleas~ure. N1Cot satisfied

fals having thus fecltred the p~offeffl~n of their
lands and dignidies, the nature of the feudal
infitutions, which though founded' on fibor-
dination verged to independence, led them to
new, and flill mor~e dangerouis encroachments
on the prerogatives of the sovereign. They
obtained the poliver ofl futpreme juari'dift~ion, hoth
civil and critiinal, withini their own territories;
the right of coining money; together with the
privilege of cai-rying on war against their pri-
vate enemies, in their own name, and by their
own aut~horityr. The ideas of political ~u~bje~tion
were almoff entirtely 10fl·, and ~frequently fearce
any appearance of feudal s~ubordination remain-
ed. Nobles , who had acquired fuzch enorr-
mous powNer, scorned to confider themselves aq~
fiibjefts. They aspired openly at being inde-
pendent: the bonds whvlich conne~he . the prin-;
cipal m~embers of the conflitution with the
crown, were diflib>lved. A king~dom, confider-
able in nasme and in extent, was. broken into
as many f'eparate principalities as it contained
powerful barons. A thouai~nd. causes of jealou-
fy and dif'cord faubfifted among them, and gave
rife to as many wars.i Every country in Eu-
rope, wasted or kept in continual· alarm during
there endless contests, was filled' with caffles
and places of th~eqgth, ere~red for the fecurityl
of the inhabitants; not agasinft foreign force,
but against internal hoffilities. .An univers~al

Sanarchy, defiru~tive, in a great measure, of all
the advantages which men ex-pe~t to derive from
faociety, prevailed. The- people, the most nu-
merous as well as the most uki~ful pzrt: of the
community, were either reduced to a Rcate of
adtual fCervituxde, or: treated with the fame info-
lence and rigour as if they had been degraded
into th~at wretched condition. I) The king,
firipped of almofit every prerograti~ve, and with-.
out authority to enaht or to execute fCalutary
:lawcs, could neither proted the -innocent , nor
punich the guilty. The nobless superior to all
restraint, haraffied each other wTCithi perpetual

·all, time g~radually fixed, and renderedj vener-
able this pernicious system, which violence
had efiablihed.

It prevented nations likrewif~e from ra~ing' with vigour in their

external. operations.

Such was the £tate of Europe with refpre~t

to the interior adminiffration of government
from th'e s~eventh to the eleventh century.Al
the external operations of its various Rcates,
during this period, were, of cours~e, extremely
feeble. A kingdom dismembered, and torn
with dissension, without any common interest
to rouze, or any common head to condua2 its
.force, was incapable Los afting w~ith vigour.

Almost all the wars in Europe, during the
ages which I have mentioned, were triflingi
indecisive, and produ~tive of no considerable
event. Theyt resembled the t~hort incurflons of
pirates or bandisti, rather than the steady opei
rations of a reg-ular army. Every baron, at
the head of his vassals, carried on some petty
enterprize, to which he was prompted by his
own ambition, or revenge. The state its~elf,
de~itute of union, either remained al~together
ina~tive, or if it attempted to: make any effort,
that served only to dificover its imnpotence.
The fuxperior genius of Charlemagne, it is true,
united all there disjointed anhd dilCfcordanLt mems-
bers, and forming them again into one; body,
reffored: to government that degree of a~tivitcy
which diftingulfhes his reigfn, and renders the
tr~anfa~tions of it, objefts not only of attenrtion
but of admiration, to more et·nlighitel· dc~ tifn~es.
But this Rtate of union and vigouar,, not blein~g
natural· to ·the feudal godv~ernment, ~was of t~hort
duration. Immediately upon his death, the
spir~it which aniimat~ed and s~ustained the vast
fyfitem which he had efitablithed, being with.
drawn, wit broke into pieces. All th1e calami-
ties which flow. from anarc~uhy and dis~cord, re-
tur-ning with additional forcle, a~ssist~ed the dif-
ferent kingdoms into which his empire was
'plit. From that timne to the eleventh century,
a fuccellion of uninteresting events; a series of
wars, the motives as well as the consequences

of which were equally~ unimportant, fill and
deform the annals of all the nations in Europe.

The fatal effefts of thlis state of {ociety on fciSences andn arts.

To these pernicious effeas of the feudal

anarchy may be added its fatal influence on the
charadter -and improvement of the human mind.
If men do not enjoy the prote~tion of regular:
goverment, together with, the certainty of
personal s~ecurity , which naturally fl~ows from
it, they never attempt to make progre~ss in
s~cience, nor aim at attaining refinement: in taste,
or in manners. That period of turbulence,
oppreffon, and rapine, which I have deferibed,
was ill faited to favour improvement in any:
of there. In less than a century after the bar-
barous nations fettled ·in their new conquest-s,
almost all the effe~s of the knowledge and ci-
vIility, which the Romans had spread through
Europe, disappeare~d. Not only the arts of
elegance, which miniff er to luxury , and are
futpported by itl, but many of the afeful arts,
without which life can fearcely be confiderect
as comfortable, were negleE~ed or 10ft. L~ite-
rat-ure, fecience, taite, were words h~ardly in
31e. during thle ages we are contemaplating ; or,
if they occur at any time, eminence in th~em is
aferibed to persons and produ~tions to contempt-
Ible, that it appears their true import was
little understood. Persons los the highest rank,
and ini the molt eminent Rtations,. could not

read or write. I1iany of th-e clergy did~ not
understand the breviary which they were oblig-
ed daily to recite ; some of them could fbar-
cely read it. K) All memory ofpaft tranfac~ions
was loft, or preserved in annals filled with
trifl~ing events, or legendary tales. Even the
codes of laws, publis~hed by the fevetial nations
which established thems~elves in the different:
countries of· Europe, fell into disuse, while,
in the'ir: place, cuffoms, vague and capricious,
were furbfituted. The human mind, negle~ted,
.uncultivated, and depressed, funk into the most
profound ignorance. Europe did. not produce,
during four centuries , one author who mnerits
to be read, either on account- of the elegance
of his composition, or the jufinef~s and novelty
of his s~entiments. Ther~e is hardly one inven-
tion useful or ornamental to society, of which
that long period can boast.

Upon religion,

Even the Christian religion, though its~

precepts are delivered , and its infltitutions are
fixed in scripture, with a precision which t~hould
have, exempted them from being· misinterpreted
or corrupted, degenerated during those ages of
darkness, into an illiberal su~perstition. The
barbarous nations, when converted to Chriftia-
nity, changred the objeat, not the spirit, of
their religious worthip. They endeavoured to

conciliate ·the favour of the true God by means
not unlike to those which they had employed
jin ,order to appeas7e thei~r falfCe deities. Inflead
of asp~iring to fCantity and v~irtitre, wrhich al~one
can render men acceptable to the great ,Author
of order and of excellence, they imagined that
-they f~atisfied' every obligation of duty by a
ferupulous `observance ,of external ceremonies.
LE) Religion, according to. their conception of it
.comprehended nothing: elfCe; and the rites, byg
.which they perfuraded themselves that they
thould gain the favour of h~eaven, were of fach
a nature as might have been expe~ted· from the
rixde ideas of the ages which devised and in-
troduced them. They were: either so u-n-
meaning as to be altogether unworthy ~of the
·Being· to whos~e honour th-ey were consecrated;
or so abfurrd as to be a disgrace to reason and
humanity. IM) Charlemague in France, and Al-
fred the Great in England~, endeavoured to dif-
pel this dar.kness, and gave their fabjeas a
thort glimpse of light and knowledg-e. B~ut the
ignorance of thle ag~e was too polwerfulr ·for their
eflforts and inftcitutions. The darknes~s returne~d,

belli~fh a polithed age, t~hey were deffRitute of'
the virtues which abound ainong people who
continue in a, simple slate. Force of -mind, a
sense of personal dignity, gallantry in enter-
prize, mnvincible perseverance in execution, con-
temnpt of danger ·and of death, are the charac-
teriffic virtues of uncivilized nations. 'But
th~ese- are all the offpring of equality and inde-
pendence, both which the feudalinftitutions had
destroyed. The spirit of domination corrupted the
nobles ; the yoke of servitude d~eprelfed the people;
the generous sentiments inspired by a sense of
equality were extinguis~hed,, and nothing re-
mained to be a check on ferbeity and violence.
?Human faceiety is in its most corrupted Rate at:
that period, when menm have loss their original
independence and simplicity of manners, but
have not attained 'that d'egree of refinement
which introduces a s~ense of decorum and of
proprietiy in conldu~t, as a restraint on thos~e
paffxons which lead to heinous crimes. Accor-
ding~ly, a greater n~umber of those atr~ocious ac-
tions, which f~ill the mind of .man with aiffonifh-
·ment and horror, occur in the hiftery of the
-centuries under revilew, than in that of any pe-
riod of the fame extent in the arrnals of Europe.
If we open the hiffory of Gregory of Tours, or
of any contemporary author, we: meet with a
series of deeds of cruelty, perfidy, and reven-
.ge, f'o wild and enorraous as almaoft: to exceedt
belief.

manners begin to imuprove.

Butt, a~ccordin~g to II V~theobevatF+ Io of anI el

gantl andc plurofoud hiflorlian, e) there is an ul-
timate point of depre~iion, as w~ell as of exal-
tation, from which human afa;irs naturally re-
turn in a contrary progress , and beyond which
thiey never pass either in their advancement or
decline. Whfen defec~ts, either in the form or
in thie admiin~ifration of government, occallon
such difiorders in society as are excefirve and in-
tolerable, it becomres the common interest disco--
ver and to apply fa~ch remedies as will most es-
feEtually remove them. Slight: inconveniencies
may~ be long overlooked or endured; but: when

The disorders in the feudal sys~tem, togrethier
w~ith the corruption of tas~te and manners confe-
quent upon these, which had gone on increaf~-
ing during a long course of yea~rs, seemed to
have attained their utmot point of excess to-
wards the close of the eleventh cen~tury. From
that: aera, we may date the return of govern-
ment and manners in a contrary direaion , and can
trace a fuaccefilion of caus~es and events which con-
tributed, some with a: nearer and rhore powerful,
others wC~ith ai more remote and less perceptible in-
fl~uence, to abolithn confullon and barbaris~m, and
to introduce order, regul~arity, and refinement,

towards this improvemuent.

In pointing out and explaining there causes

and events, it: is not neceilkry to observe the
order of time with a chronological accuracy; it
is of more importance to keep in view their
irnutuial coiane~tion and dlependance, and to thiovei
holy the operation of one event , or onle cause,
prepared the w~ay for another, and augmn-ented
its influence. We have hitherto beeix contem-

the period of greatest ob~c~uration,; a more plea-
sant exercise begins here, to obs~erve the sirs
dawaings of returning light, to mark the va-

and advanced towards the full splendor of day.

The tenldency of the CrtifTades to introduce a chance in govern-

~ment and manners.

I. The Crusades , or expedlitionas in order

to rescue the Holy Land out of the hands of
Infidels, seem to be the firB: event that routed
Europe from the lethargy .in which it had been
long- funk , and that tended to introduce any
change in government or in manners.

;The mo~re reinote causes of these expeditions.

It is natural to the human mind to viewr

those places which have been diftinguifh~ie d by

being the residence of any illustrious perfonagre,
or the feene of any great tranfac'tion , with
fbme degree of delight and veneration. From
this principle flowed the f~uperflitious devotion
with which Christ~ians, from the earliest ages
of the chiurch, wYere accuffomed to viiit that
country which the Almighty had tjeleftedt as
the inheritance of his faivourite people , and in
which the Son of God had accomplished the
redemption of mlankind.' As thiS diflant pilgri-
mage could not be performed without confider-
able expence, fatigue?, and danlger, "it appeared

which the European nations ever enga~ged, and
which all undertook with equal ardour , re-

But: fiei~m threre exuped~itions , extravag-ant

as they were, beneficial consequences f-ollowed,
which had neither been foreseen nor expe~tedi.
In their pro~gress towards the H~ol~y Land, the~
followiers of the crof's marched througfh coun-
tries better cultivated , andi more civiliz~ed than
their own. Their first rendez-vous was com-
menly in Italy, in which 17enice, denoa, Pi-
f~a, and oither cities, had beg~un to apply them-
selves to comrmerce, and ·had made f'ote ad-

vances~-~ towardsi welt a well as re~finement.
They emrbarked there, and landing in Dalma-
tia, pursued their route by land to, Conflan~ti-
trople. Though the military spirit had been
long extin&c in the eastern Empire, and a de~rpo-
tifm of the worst s~pecies had 'annihilated almost
every public virtue, yet Conflantinople, having
never felt the deftru~tive rage o~f the barbarous
nations, . was the greatest, as iwell as the most
beautiful city in Europe, and the only one in
which there rem~ained any image of the ancient
elegance in manners and arts , the naval po-

wer of the enftern empire was confidierable.
MVanufnaures- of the most curious fabrick were
. carried on in ~its dominions. Coniantin ople
wjas the only mart in Europe for the commrodii
ties of the Eait Indies. Althoug~h the Saracens
and Turks had torn from the Empire many of
its r~ichest provinces, and had reduced it within
very narrow bounds , yet great wealth flowed
into the capital from thes~e various sources,
which not only cherithed fach a tast~e for mag-
irificence, but kept alive such a relish for the
sciences , as appears co~nsiderable, when com-
pared 4 with what was knowzn in other parts of
Europe. Even in Aiia, the Europeans , who
-had afrurmed. the cr'ofs, found the remains of
the knowledge and arts. which the example and
encouragement of the Caliphns had diffufed th~rough
their Eimpire. Allthough the attention of the hi-
Rorians of the Crdiades was fixed on other ob-

fity in the condua of SaladinL, as well as some
oth~er leaders of the Mahomnet~ans, as grive us a
very high idea of their manners. It was not
pofft~ble for the Crusa~ders to travel through so
many countries , and to behold their various
customs and infititutions, without acquiringr in-

perceive~d that great sums were necessary to-
wards defraying the expence of such a diffant
expedition, and enabling them to appear with
faitable dig3nity at the head of their vassals. But
the genius of the feudal fyfitem was averfei- to
the imposition of extraordinary taxes; and s~ub-
jeats in that age were uinaccuftomed to pay
them. Nho exlpedient remained for le:ying the
famns requjifite, but the sale of their poff~e~iions.
As men w~ere inflamed wit~h romantic expe~ta-
tions of the splendid conquests w~hichl they hop-
ed to maire in Asia, and poff~effed with such
zeal f'or r:ecovering the Holy Land as sw~allowed
up every other pafiron, they relinquished their
ancient inheritance~s writhout any re chtance,
and for prices far. below their va~lue, that they
might salty fbrth as adventurers in quest of new
f~ettlemnents in unknowrn countries. The mo-
narks of the· great kingdoms in the weft, none
of whom had engaged in the first Crusade, ea-
g~erly ~e~ized this opportunity of~ aninexing con-
fiderable territories to their crowns at small ex-
pence i). Besides this , several great baron a

Aristocracy declined. The absence, too, of
many potent vass~als, accuitomed to controuli
and give lawr to their f~orereigns, afforded them
an opportunity of extending their prerogative,

.adopted the plan of conferr~ing new privileges
on the tOwn1s situated within his owvn domnain~e.
These privileges were called ch~arter~s of commu-
n~ity, by which he enifranchired the inhalbitants ,
atbolifhed all- maprks of efevitude,~ and formed
themt into corporatio~ns or bodies politic, to be

As one part of the people -owed th~eir liber

had been the R~tate of Europe duiring s~everal cen-

to court the- paitronage of iome powerful ba.

towns f~urto-unded with wallsi whose inhabitants
were regularly trained to arms, and bound. by
interest, as well as by the moss foleinn engage-

forded a more commnodious and fecurie retreat.

SIs the nlobilitT fuffered some diminution of

their credit and power by the privileges granted

The acqulfition of liberty made such a happy

change in th-e condition of all the members of
communities, as rouited them from that inaffion
into which they had been funk by the wretch-

the feat of povertyT and opprefi~ron. Wealth was;
accompanied by its usual attendants, oftenta-p

tion and luxury; and though the forme~rwas mne-
legant anid cumbed~ome, and the latter indelf-
cate, they led gradualy to greater refinement
ini mannlers, and in the hab~itLs: of life. Together
wtith this improvement in marnners, -a more re-
gular Epecies of government and police was in;
troduced. As cities grew to be more popullous,
and the occasions of int~ercourse among men in-
creased., Itatutes and regulations multiplied of
course, and aill became sensible that their com=
Inon safety depended on observing them wt
exadnef's, and on punishing such as violated
them, wtith promptitude and rigour. Laws and
thibordinatjion , as well as polithed masnners, tak-
ing their rife in cities, diffufed themselves in-·
s~ensibly through the reft of the society.
The inhabitants of cities alcquire political power , as members

of the confkitqytion.

III. T~he inhabitants of cities, havting obtain-

ed perso~nal freedom and municipal jurisdi~tion,
soon acquired civil liberty and political power.
It was a fundamental principle in the feudal
ty~ftem of policy, tha~t nQ ifreeman could be go-;
verned or taxed onle~fs by his own cod~ent. In
consequence of this, the vjffals f every baron
were called to his court, in which they efka-
blished, by mptual codent, such regulations as
they deemed most beneficial to their fCmall so.-
tiety, snd granted their fizperior such supplies
of money, as were proportional to their abilities,

or to his want~s. 'The barons themnfelves, con-
formably to the fame iinaxhn, wh er e admitted
into the supreme assembly of thae nation, and
concnrred with the forereign in ena~intg laws,
or in impoling taxes. As the fuxperior lord,
according to the original plan of feudal policy,
retained the ti~ret pro erty of thos~e lands which
he granted, in temporary poirellion, to his vas-
fals; the law, even after fiefs became hereditary,
nt i fppof~ed this original pra~tice to fnubift, and
a baron continued to be considered as the guar-
dian of all who resided wvithin his territories.
The great council of each nationl, whether dif-
tinguiifhed ify the name of a parliament, a diet,
the Cortes, or the Rantes general, was compos-
ed entirely of faxch barons, and dignified eccle-
flitfics, as held immediately of the crown. TJiowns,
whether sit~uated within the royal domaine or
on the lands of a fabjeC~t, dlepended for protec-
~tion on the lord of whom they held. They had
no legal name,' no political existence, which
could entitle them to be admitted int~o the le-
gislative affemtbly , or could give them any
·authority there. But: as soon as they were en-
franchir~ed, and ~formed inmto bodies corporate,
they became legal and independent memlfers of
the conititution, and acquired all the rights es.
f~ential to freemen. ;Amongst there, the~moft va-
Juable was, the privilege of a decisive voice in

lidies. 'It: was natural fbr cities, a~ccuftomned to

the ~first countries in whfich the representa~tives
of boroughs were admitted into the, great coun;
ciil of the nation, thie barons wvho took ~arms
against Henry III. (A. D. I2665.) summoned
them to attend parliament, in order to add great-
er popularity to their party, and to; ifrengthen
the barrier against the eneroa~chment of regal
powyrer. In Fr~ance, Philip the Fair, a monarch no
lCefs sagaci~ous than enterpr~iz-ing, considered themr
a~s infetrumen-ts which inight be emptloy~ed with
equal adv~antage to extend the royal. prerogative,

. The happy effeAs of this uponr government.

But in what way soever the representatives

.Of cities si-rs g~ained a place in the legilslature,
that event had great influence on the form and
genius of government. It tempered the rigour
of ariffocratic~al oppreflion with a proper mixture
ogf propul'ar liberty: It fecuzred to the great body
of the people, who had formerly no reprefen-
tatives j a~tive and powerful guardians of their
righ~ts and privrileges : It establis~hed an inter-
mediate power between the king and nobles,
to which- each. had recourse alternately, and
wh~-ich at fobme times oppofled' the ufurrpat~ions
-of the fo~rmer, on· other occasions checked the
.eneroac-hments- of the latter. ACs s~oon as the
:representatives of communities gained any de-
gr~ee of csredit and· influence in the legislature,
the f'pirit of laws became diff~erent: from what it
hkad formerly been; it floved from new princin
pl~es; it was directed towards new .obje £ts ;
.eqitality, order , the publie good, and the re-
dihefs of· grieitances, were phrates and ideas
brough~t into use, and which g-rew to be famii

ropean nations. Almost all the efforts in favour
of liberty in every <country of Europe, hqye
~been made by this new power in the legi~slature.
In proportion as it rose to consideration and in-
fluence, the severity of the ariftocratical spirit
decreased; and the privileges of the people be-
came gradually more extenilve, as the ancient
and exorbitant jurifailition of the nobles was
asbxriged. T)

The people acqjuire liberty by enfranchirement.

IV. The inhabitants of towns having been

declared free by the charters ofrcommunities,
that ~part o-f th~e people which r~elided in the
country, and was employed in agriculture, be-
gan to recover liberty by enfranchirement·. Dure
ing the rigour of feudal government, as hath
been already observed, the great body of the
lower people was reduced to servitude. They
were sl~aves fixed to the fail which they culti-
vated, and together with it were transferred
from one proprietor to another, by fkle, or by
conveyance. -The s~pirit of feudal policy did
not favoaur thie enfr~anchilement of that order of
men. It was an eftablithed max~im, that no
va~ssal could legally diminifht the vralue of a fCief,
to the detriment of the lord from whom he
had received it. In consequence of this, ma.
zlumillion by th~e authority of the immediate
snafterl was not valid: and unless it was confirme

ed 'by the t~hperior lord of whom he held, fla-
ves belonging to the fief did not acquire a com-
plete right to their liberty. Thus in became
necessary to ascend through all the gradations
of feudtal holding to the King, the lord Paraw
mount a). A form of procedure ~so tedious and
troublefomne, discouraged the pra~tice of manu-
miiron. Domestic or personal slaves often ob-
tained liberty from the humanity or beneficence
of their masters, to whom they belonged in
absolute property. The condition of slaves fixed
to the f~oil, was much more unalterable.

The motives and progres~s of this,

But the freedom and independence which

one. part of the people had obtained by the in-
itituxtion of communities, inspired the other with
the most ardent desire of acquiring the f~ame pri-
vileges; and their fu~peri~orts, sensible of the b~e-
Snefits which they themfeklves hlad derived from
former conceilions, were less uLnwilling to gra-
tify them by the grant of new immunities. Thle
enfranchisement of flav es became more frequent:;
and the Myonarchs of France, prompted~ by ne-
ceffity no less than by their inclination to reda-
ce the power of the nobles , endeavoured to
render it gecizeral. Louis X. and his brother
Philip, issued ordinances, declaring, (A. D. z3r5
andl +I38). ,, That as ~all men were by nature

kingdom of Franks , they determined that it;
should be so in reality as well as in name; the-
refore they appointed that enfranchifements
·fhourld 'be granted troughout the whole king-
dotm, upon just and reasonable condi~tions b)."6
Trhere edi~ts were carried into imm~ediate exe-
cution within the: royal domaine. The exam-
ple of their sovereigns, together with the ex-
peffation of considerab~le sums which they might
raise by this exupedient, led many of the nobles
to set their dependants at liberty; and servitude
was gradually abolished in almost every pro-
vince of the kingdom U). In Italy, the e~a-
`blifhment of republican goverhment in their
great cities, the gehius and maxims of which
were extremely different from those of the feu-
dal policy , together with the ideas of eqluality,
which the progress oif commerce had rendered fa-
miliar, gradually introduced the pradtice of en-
franchising the ancient predial slaves. In some
provinces of Germany, the pers~ons who had been
fubjeft to this species of bondage were releaf~-
ed; in others, the rigour of their Rtate was mi-
tigated. In England, as the spirit of liberty
gained ground, the very name and idea of per-
f'onal servitude, without any formal interport-

·tion of the legifiature to prohibit it, was totally
barnifhed.

The effea~s ofr this upon the imcprovemecnt of Faccety.

The effe~s of such a remarkable chang-e in

the condition of so great a part of the peiiople,
could not fail of. being considerable and. exteni
£ive. Th-e hdubandm~~an , mas~ter of ·his ;own in-
duffry , and secure of reaping for hitnfielf the'
fr~uit~s of' his labour, -became the farrmer of the
fame fields wh~ere he ha~d formerly been com-
gelled to tdil for the benefit of another. The
odious names of master and- of slave, the most
mor tify~ing: and· deprefilag of all. dlrif~tieqns to
hiuman niature, were abolish~ed. New prof~e~ts
opened, and new incitements to ingenuity and.
en~terp.rize p~resented themnfeblies to those who
were emanc~ipated. Thpe~ expe~tation of better-o
Ihg their fortune , as well as: that of raising
t~hemselves to a more honourable condition, con-
curred in calling forth their a~tivity and genius;
and a numerous cl~ass of men , who formaerly
had4 no political ex-istence, and were employed
merely as· infframents of labour, became ureful
citizens ·, and contriblited towards aungmenting
the. force or riches of the faciety, wrhic~h adopt-
ed them as members.

T~he introdu~tion of a mrore· regular adminiffraton of jultice, con-

tributes to the imrrrlovenient of s~ociety.

V. The various expsedients which were emf-

ployed in order to introduce a more regular,

equal , and vigorous admini~ration of juffice,
contributed greatly towards the improvement
of faciety. What was the particular mode of
dif~peniing justice in the several barbarous nations
which over-ran the Roman Empire , and took
poffeffion of its diferent provinces, cannot now
be determined with certainty. We may con-
clude, from the form of government established
among· them, as well as from their ideas con-
cerning the nature of society , that the autho-
rity of the mag-istrate was extremely limited ,
and the independence of individuals prop~ortio-
nally great. Hifk~ory and records , as far as
there reach back , juffify this, conclufxon , and
reprefeat the ideas and exercise of juffice in all
the countries of Europe, as little different from
·thos~e which must take place in a itate of na-
ture. To maintain the order and tranquillity
of society by the regular execution of known
laws; to infli&t vengeance on crimes defkrudtive
of the peace and safety of individuals , by a
prosecution carried on in the name , and by the
authority of the community ; to confxder the
punithment of criminals as a public example to
deter others from violating the laws; were ob-
jedts of government little underflood in theory,
and Jess regarded in prad~ice. The magistrate
could hardly be said to hold the t~word of jufth
ce; it' was left in the hands of private persons.
Res~entment was almost the sole motive for pro-
Ifecuting crimes ; and to gratify that paflon ,

was the end and rule in pu~nifbing them. He
who ~fuffered the wrong, was the only person
who had a right to pursu~e the aggrefror, and
to exaft or to remit the punis~hment. From a
i'yftem of judicial procedure, so crude and de-
ser~tive as feemsJ to be fearcely compatible with
the fhbtrilience of civil s~ociety , disorder and
anarchy flowed. Superstition concurred with
this ignorance concerning· the nature of govern.-
ment , in obff ru~ting the admi~nifkration of jufti-
ce, or in rendering it capricious and unequal.
To provide remedies for there evils, so, as to
gtive a more regular course to juff-ice, was, dur-
ing several centuries, one great obje~k of poli-
tical wifdiom. The regulations for this purpos~e
may be reduced to three general heads: To exe
plain the~e , and to poin~t~ out thie· manner in
which they operated, is an important article in
the hiftery of society among the nations of Eu-
rope.

This e~ffe~ed by abolithing the pradtice of private war,

1-. The first considerable fiep towards effa-

blithing an equal adminis~tration of justice, was
the abolish:ment of the right which individuals
claimed of waging war with each other , in
the'lr own name, and by their own authority.

Original ideas of men con~cerning juffice.

To repel injuries, and to revenge wrongs, is:

no less natural to man, than to oulltiva~te frIe3nd-

~ship : and while society remains in. its m~ft funr-
ple slate, the former is considered as a perfro-
nal right no less unalieriable than the latter.
Nor do men in this situation~ d~eem that they
have a~ title to redres~s their own wrongs alonre;
they are touched with t'he injuries of those with
whom they are conne~ed, or in whvofe honour
th~ey are interested, and are no less prompt to
avelnge them. The savage , how imaperfeatly
f'oever he may comprehend the principles of poo
litical union , feels war-mly the fenatimn~ts of·
social affe~ion , and the obligations arising from
the tries of blood. On the appearance of airt
injuryv or affront orffered to his family or tribe,
he kindles into rage, and purs~ues the authors:
of it with the kee~nefit rese~ntment. He confidters
it as cowardly to excess redress from any arnsl
but his own, and as infaLmous to give uxp tb
another the right of dleterzmining what: repara-
tion he thouzld accept, or with what vengeance
he t'ho~ldl redt faitisfied.

Thel's lead to the practice of private war.

The mnaximns and pradtice of afll uncivilized

nittions , with. refpedt to the prof~ecutioni and
punifhmetit of offenders , plarticularly thos~e of
the ancient Germans, and other Barbarians whofi
invaded the Roman Empire, are perfeccly con-
formable to there ideas e). While theyr re-

tained their n~ative iimplicity of manners, and
cpntinued to be divided into~ small tribes or s~o-
cleties, the defens in this imperfeQt system of
crimninal Jurisprudence if it merits thaet· name
were less sensibly felt. When they came to
fettle in the exteniive provinces which they~had
conqu~ered, and to form themselves into great
monarchies; when new aobjec~s of ambition pre-
Ifentng themselves, increased both the number
and the violence of theii dissensions, they ought
to have adopted new maxims concerning the re-
dress of injuries , and to have regulated , by
general and equal laws, that which they soir-
merly left to be direated by the caprice of pri-
vate pafflon. But fierce and haughty chieftains,
acc-ufomned to avenge themafelves on ~u~ch as hLad
injured them, did not think of relintquithing a
right which they consider~ed as a privilege of
their order , and: a mark of their independence..
Laws enforced by the aguthority! of princes and
magiffrates, who poffeired little power , com-
~ananded no great degree of reverence. The
-adminiffration of justice among rude illiterate
people , was not f'o accurate , or decisive, or
uniform, as to induce men to' fa~mit implicitly
to its determninations, Every offended b~aron
`buckledO on his armour, and fo-ught redress at
the head of his vassals. His adverf'ar~y met
him in like hostile array. Neither of them ap-.
pealed to impotent laws , which could afford
them no proteeaion. N~either of them would

s~ubmit: points A in which their pallions were
warmly interested , to the flow determination
of a judicial enquiry. Both truffed to their
fwvords for the deciflon of the contekt. The
kindred and dependanits of the aggre~ssor, as well
as of the defender, were involved in the quar-
rel. They had not even the liberty of remain-
ing neutral. Such as refus~ed to ad in concert
with the party to which they belonged , were
~not only exposed to infamyi but faxbjeaed to
legal penalties.

The pernicious effeas of it,

The different Kingdoms of Europe were

torn and affliked, during f'everal centuries, by
intestine warsj excited by private animofities,
and carried on with all the rage natural to men
of fierce manners, and of violent passions. The
estate of every baron was a kind of indepen-
debt: territory , dif~oing~d from thiofe around it,
and the henftilities between -them were perpe-
tual. The evil became' to inveterate and deep-
rooted, that the form and laws of private war
were ascertained, and regulations concerning
it made a part in the tyfitem of jurisprudence, d)
in the fame: manner as if this pradice ha~d been
founded in some natural right of humanity, or
in the original constitution of civil fociet .

Various methods employed in order to aboifh it.

So great was the disorder, and sauch the

calamities, which there perpetual hoffilities oc-
cafloned , that: various efforts were made to
wrest from the nobles this pernicious privilege
which they claimed. It was the interest of
every sovereign to abolish~ a prai~ice which al--
most anninhilated his authority·. Charlemagne pro-
hibited it by an express law, as a~n invention
of the devil to def'troy the order and happine~s;
of faciety e); but the reign of one monarch,
however vigorous and a&ive, was too short to
-extirpate a custom so firmly eftablithed. Instead·
of enforcing this p~rohibition, his feeble fuec-
ceffors durst venture on nothing more than to
aplE paliatives. 'I'ey declared it unlawful forr
any plerfon to commence war, unitil he had fert;
a formal defiance to the-kindred and dependants
of his adversary; they ordained that, after the
commillion· of the tres~pas~s or crime which gave
rife to a private war, forty days muf~rt elapfie
before the pers~on injured t~hould attack the vas~
fals of his adversary; they enjoined all pers~ons
to fut~pend their private ani~mofities, and to.
cease from hostilities, when the kin~g was en-~
gaged in any war against the enemies of the
'nation. The church co - operated with the ci.
vil mag~iffrate, and interposed its authority in
order to extirpate a pradtice tCo repugnant to the
Spyirit of Christianity. VTarious councils issued

ecclefiaffic authority, though fkrengtheneh by
every thing moit apt to alarm and to overawe
the credulous spirit of those ages,· produced no
other effedt than some temporary ful~peniions of
hoRilities, and a cefiktion from war on certain
days and feafbns co~nsecrate-d to the more folemnr
ac~s of devotion. The nobles continued to as-
fert this dangerous privilege; t'hey refufred to
obey fbme of thie lawvs calculated to annul ot:
circumferibe it; they eluded others; they petr-
tioned;, they remonfirated; they fktraggled for
the r~ight. of priva-te wiar, as the highest and
most honourabl~e diftinffian of their order. Ejven
to late as the fourteenth century, we find th'e
nobles, in several provinces of France, con-
tending for their- anelent method of termin ating
their differencesiby the sw~ord, in preference' to

thbat of fabmitting them to the de~cii~on of' a~y·
~judg~e. The final. ·abolition of this praftice in

it prevailed, is not to be- aiccribed to much to
th~e force: of statutes and. decrees, as t~o th~e gra.

arts of reading and writing were such uncom.,
meon attainments, that to be mnafter of either
intitled a person to the appellation of a clere
or learned man, fearcely any thing was com-
mitted to writing but treaties between princes,
their grants and charters to their fu~bjeats, or
s~uch tranf~a~tins between private parties as
were of exitraordinary consequence , or had
an extediive effe&t. The greater part of affairs
in common ltife and busines~s, were carried on
by verb;al contra~ts or promis~es. This, in ma~-
ny civil questions, not only made it difficult to
bring proof f~ufficient to establish any claim, but
encouraged falsehood and fraud, by rendering
them, extremely easy. Even in criminal cafes,
where a particular fa&~ must be afrcertained, or
accusation be disproved, the nature and effe&t
of legal evidence was little understood by bar-
barous nations. To define with accuracy that
fpgecies of evidence which a court had reas~on to
exped; to determine when it ought to insist on
positive proof, and when it th~iould be satisfied
with a· proof from circumitances ; to compare
the testimo~ny of difrcordant witnefes; and to
fix the degree of credit due to each; were dif.
cufflons too intricate and fabtile for the jurifpru-
dence of ignorant ages. In' order to" avoid en-
cumbe-ring themselves with therie, a more fim-i
ple form of procedure was introduced into
courts as well civil as criminal. In all cares,
where the notoriety of the faB did not furnith

the

the clearteit and most dir e6 evidence , the per-
son accused, or he againf21 whom an a~tion was
brought, was called legally, or offered volun-
tarily to purge linde,!lf by oa~th; and up~on his
d~eclarinlg his innrocence, he wass in-stantly ac-
quitted. f) This absurd praftice eff~eaually icreen-
ed guilt and fraud f'rom d'ete~tion and punitfh-
ment, by rendering thE1 t~emptation to perjury
to powerf~ul, that it was not easy to refiftl it.
The pernicious e~ffeas-of it were sensibly felt;
and in order to guard against them, the ~law-s
ordained, thate oath;s t~hould be administered wrirh
great fblemnity, and accompanied with~ ebery

verence, or superstitio~us terror. g) This, howT-

on the imragination gradually diminiafujed; men
who could venturre to disr~egard truth, were noct
apt to startle at the folemnities of an oath.
Their obf'ervation of this, put legislators upon
devising a new expedient for rend~ering- the pur-·
gation by oath .more certain and faitisfa~tory.

was s~ure of devoted adherentsi willingr to abet,
and' eager to serve him in whatever manner he

a ainft falsehood and perjury; and the fenten-
ces of court's, whrlile they continued to refer
et-ery point in question to the oath of the defen-

ing a more proper form, our ancestors, as an
infallible me~thod of discovering· truth, and of
guarding apga~inf deception, appealed to Heaven,
and referred every point in dis~pute to be deter-
muined, as t~hey imagined, by the decifxons of
unerring wi~sdom and impartial justice. The per-
sion accused, in order to prove his innocence,
f~ubmaitted, in fomne cafes, to trial, by plunging
his arm in boiling water; by lifting a red-hot
iron· with his naked hand; by walking bare-foot
over burning plough - heres; or by other ex-
periments equally perilous and formidable.

Particularly by judicial combat.

On other occallons, he challenged his ac-

icnfe to fight him in single combat. All there
ivarious forms of trial were condu~ted with mna-
ny devout ceremonies; the ministers of religion
were employed, the Almighty was called upon
to interpose for the manifestation of guilt, andil
Sfor the prote~tion of innocence; and whoever es-
caped unhurt, or came off vifterious, was pro-
nounced to be acquitted by the Judgment of God.1)

tions which owe their existence to the weakne~ss
of human reason, this, which submitted questions

that: affe~ted2 the property; the reputation, and
the lives of men, to t~he d~eterminat~ion of chani-
ce, or of bodily Atrength and address, appears
to be the moR extravagant and prepofe-rous.
There w~ere circ-umfances, however, which led~
thie nations of Europe to confidcer this equivrcal
mod-e of deciding any point in contest, as· a di-
re~t appeal to Heaven, and a certain mnethod of
dis~covering its will. As men are unable to com-
prehend the manner in which the Almighty catr-
rieS on thfe governmient of thle universe, by·
eq~ual, fixed, and general l~awt·s, th~ey are apt
to imaag-ine, that in every cafe which their pas-
fions or in terest render important in thleir own
eyes, the Supr~eme Ruler of all ought vifxbly to
du~play his power, in vindicating innocence and
punishing vice. It requires no inconsidera~ble
degree of feience and philof~ophny to colrre~t this
pop-ular error. But the sentiments prevalent in
Eu-rope d2uring the darkr ages , inficad of cor-
re~ting, firengthened it. Religion, for s~everal:
centuries, conlifed chiefly in believing the le-
gendary of thof'e f'aints whose names crowd and
difg ra"ce the Romit'h c alendar·. The fabulous;
rtaes concerdiing their miracl~es, had been de-
clared autihentic by the buils of popes, an~d the
decrees of councils, they made the great s~ub-
ject of' the inftrru~ioinas which the clergy offered
to~ the peopl~e, and were received by them w~ith
implicit credulity and admiration. B~y attending:
to thel'e, men were accuitomzed to 'believe that

'the eRablifhed lawzs of nature might: be violated
on the moRa frivolous occasions, arid were taught:
to lookr rather for particular and extraordinary
;zas of power under the divine adminiffration,
than to contemplate the regular progress and
execution of a general plan. dOne superstition
prepared the way f'or another; and whoever be-
lieved that the Supreme Being had interposed
miraculously on thos~e trivial occallons mention-
ed in legends, could not but expec2 his inter-
vention in matters of greater importance, when
~solemnly referred to his decifron.

And likewifeir by the~ir martial ifpirit.

W4iith t~his f~uperftitiouzs opinion, the martial

s~pirit of Europe, during the middle ages , con-
curred in eitablif'hing the mode of trial by judi-
.cal combat, To be ready.to. maintain with his
fivord whatever his lips had~uttered, was the
fi~rst: maxim of honour with every gentleman.
To aftert their own rights by force of arms,
to inflid vengeance on thos~e who had injured
or affr~onted t-hem, where the diftind2ion and pride
of high - spirited nobles. The ;form of trial
by combat coinciding with this maxim, flatter-
ed and2 gratified these pafflons. Every man was
the guardian of his own honour, and of his owon
life; the judlice of his cauf'e, as well as his fu-
ture reputation, depended on his own coulrage
anc prowess. This mode of deciiion was con-
fidered, accordingly, as one of the happie&~ es-

forts of wvife policy : and as soon as it was- in-·
troduced , al-l the forms of trial by fire or wa~-
ter , and other s~uperstitious experiments, fell
into d~isus~e, or were employed only in contro-
verfies between pers~ons of inferior rank. The
trial by combat was authorized over all Europe,
and received in every country with equal fatis-
fadioni Not only qureftions concerning uncer-
tain or contested fads, but: general and abftra&
points in law, were determined by the ifrue of
a combat; andct the lat~ter was deemed. a method
of discovering truth more liberal as well as
more fatisfa~ory, than that by examination and
argument. Not only might parties, 'whof~e minds
were exasperated by the eagerner~s and the ho-
ftility of opposition, defy their antagonist, and
require him to m'akie good his charge, or to prove
his innocence, wirth his sword; but witnef-
fes, who had no interest in the issue of the que-
fkion, thoug-ht called to declare the truth· by
laws which ough~t to have afforded them pro-
teaion, were equally exposed to the danger of
a challenge, and equally bound to assert the.ve-
ratcity of their evidence by dint of arms. To
complete the abs~urdities of this military juris-
prudence, even de charader of a judge was
not sacred from its violence. Any one of the
parties might interrupt a judge when about to
deliver his opinion; might accute him of iniqui-
ty and corruption in the most reproachful terms,
and throwing down his gountlet, might: chal-

leng~e him to defend his integrity in the field;
nor could h~e, without infamy, refus~e to accept:
the defiance, or decline to enter the lifts against
fsc'h an adverthry.

It becom~es universal.

Thus the form of trial by comba~t, like

other abu~e~s, spread gradually?, and extended
·to all persons, a~nd almoff to aill cafes. Eccle-
iiiafics, women, minors, fulperannuated and in-
firm persons, who could not with decency or
juffice be compelled to take arms, or to malin-,
·t~ain thetir own cauf'e, were obliged to produce-
champions, whom they engaged, by atre~tion
or rewards, to fight their battles. The folem-
nities of a judicial combat were such a~s were
natural in anl ac'tion, which wras considered both
a~s a fomal appeal to God, and as the final de-
cifion <f questions of the highest moment. Eve-
ry circunftance relating to them was regulated
by the edias of princes, and explained in the
commaxts of lawyers, with a minute and even
fu-perfitions accuracy. Skill in there lawvs and
rights was the only feience of which warlikre
noblesboafted, or which they were amnbitious
to attan m).

B3y this barbarous cuff om, the natural cour-

fe of proceeding,' both in civil and criminal que-
flions, wyas entirely perverted. Force uifuped
the place of equity in tourts of judicature, and
justice was banished from her proper madiion.
;Dif'cernment, learning, Integrity, were quali-
ties less neceffry to ad judge, than bodily
firength and dexterity in the use of arms. Dar-
ing courage, and fuzperior vigour or address,
were of more moment towards securing thte
favourable iflize of a, fait, than the equity of
a cause, orr the clearnefis of the evridence. Men,
of courf'e, applied themselves to culti~vate the
talents which they found to be of greatest uti-
lity. As firength of body and addrefrs 12 arms.
were no less requisite in thos~e lifts which they
were obliged to enter in defence of their pri-
vate rights, than in the' field `of battle, where
they met the ,enemies of their country, it be-
camee the great obje&c of education, as well as
the chief employment of life, to acquie these
martial accomplifhmenlts. The adminitration
of justice, idniead of accustoming men to listen
to the voice of equity, or to; r.everence he de-
cifions rs law, added to the ferocity <f their

amanners, and taught them to confider farce as
the great arbiter of right and& wrong.

V~arious expedients for abolithing thris pra~ice

There pernicious effeets of the tial by

comnbat were so obvious, that they did not; al-

together efeape the view of the unobfervilg· age
in whrlicha it was introduced. The clergy, from
thie begixuning, remonitrated against it as re-
pugnant to their spirit of Christianity·, and fa~b-
verfive of juffice and order n). But the ma-
xims and paizons which favoured it, had taken
s~uch hold of the minds of men, that they dif-
regarrded admonitions and ceduires, which, on
other occasions, would have struck them with
terror. The evil was too great and inveterate
to yield to that remedy, and continuing to in-
crease, thre civil power at length found it ne-
ceffary to interpose. Conscious, however, of
their own limited authority, monarchs proceed-
ed w~ith cau~tion , and their first attempts to
renrain, '

r to set any bounds to this pra~ice,

were extremely feeble. One of the earliest
-refiri~ions of this prai~ice whiich occurs in the
hif'tory of Europe, is that of Henry I. of Eng-
land. It'extendied no farther than to prohibit:
the trial by combat in questions concerning pro-
perty of small value o). Louis VII. of Firance
imiltated his example, and if2ued an edidt to
the fame? eff'e& p). St. Louis, whose ideas as
-ale~gifator were far su~perior to those of his
age, endeavoured to intrloduce a more perfed
jurisprudence , and to fiubftitute the trial by evi-
dence, in place of that by combat. But his

ed to his own domnains; for the great vassal~s
of the crown poffeffekd farch independent autho-
rity, and w'er? to fondly attached to the ancient
pradice, that he durst not venture to extend it:
to the whole kingdom. Some barons volunta-
rily adopted his reg-ulations. The spirit of
courts of justice became averse to the mode of
decision by combat, and discouraged it: on every
oceafxon.' The nobles , nevertheles~s, thought
it to honourable to depend for the security of
thteir livres and fortunes on their own courage
alone, and contended with fio much vehemen-
ce for the pres~ervation of this favourite privilege
of thieir order, that the farcceffors of S~t. Louis,
unable to oppose, and afraid of otfending fixch
powverfuzl faibjeats, were obliged not only to
tolerate, but to authorize the pra~tice which
he had attempted to abolis~h 4). In other coun-
tries ofEurope, efforts equally zealous were
employed t~o maintain the establis~hed custom;
and funilarP conceffrons were extorted from their
refpedtive f~oreteigns. It continued, however,
to be an objsea of policy with every monarch
of abilities or vigour, to explode the trial by
combat; and various edidts were ifixed for this
purpose. But the observation wvhich was made
concerning the right of pr-ivate war, is equally
applicable to thie made of trial under review.

the manners and prejudices of the age in which
it prevails, was ever abolis~hed by the bare pro-
mulgation of laws and statutes. The sentiments
of the people muff change, or fomae new po-
.wer f'uffficient to countera&f it must be Introduc-
ed. Such a change accordingly took place in
Europe, as science gradually increased, and
society advanced towards more perfedt order.
Inl proportion as the prerogative of princes ex-
tended, and came to acquire new force, a po-
wer, interested in fupprefirng every pradice
favourable to the independence of the nobles,
was introduced. The firuggle , nevertheles~s,
subsisted for s~ev~eral centur~ies; fometimnes the
new regulations and ideas seemed to gain ground;
flometimes ancient h~abits recurred; and thoug~h,
Itpon the wvhole, the trial~ by combat: went more
and more into disuse, yet instances of it occur,
as late as the sixteenth century, in the history
both of France and of England. In proportion
as it declined , the regular administra~tion of
juffice was reffored, the proceedaings of courts
were dire~ted by known laws, the fludty of
these became an objeat of attention to judg~es,
and the peopile ofEuarope advanced fast towards
civility , when this great cause of the ferocity
of their manners was removed. Y)

1' 3. By authorizing the right of appeal from

the courts of the barons to those of thle king,
and fabjedingr the decillotts of the former to the
review of the l~atter, a new flep, not les~s confi-
derable than th~ose wh-ich~ I have alreadyv me~n-
tioned, was ·take -towards establishing the regu-
lar, consistent, and vigor~ous administration of
justice. 1Amlong all the encroachments of the
feudal 'nobles. on the prerogative of their mo-
narchs, threir afarping the admniniffration of ju-
itice with fu~preene -authority, both in ci~vil and
criminal causes, within the precinc~ts of their
own estates, was the most singular. Inr other
nations, fubje~ts have con~tended with thleir prin-
ces, and have endeavour~ed to extend their own
power and privileges; but in the hiffory of their
struggles and pretentions, we dis~co-ver nothing
iimilar to this right which the feudal barons claim-
ed, and acquired.

Orirgin of thle fupremeo and independent jurif'diffion of the· nobility.

It must have been s~omething peculiar in

their genius and manners that fTuggefted this
idea, and promted them to infiift on fach a
claim. Among ~the rude peotple who conquer-
ed the vari'ous provinces of the Raoman Em-
pire, and eftablithied new hingdoms there, the
paflion of resentment, too im~petuous to bear
controul?, was permritted to remain almost unrei

Arlaned by the authority of laws. The person :
offended,- as has been obs~erved, ·retaine~d not only
the right of prosecuting, but of punishing his ad-
v~erfarZy. To; hims it belonged to inflia foch ven-
geane as fastiatedf his rage, or to accept of fac~h
fSatisfa~t~ion as a~ppeased it. But while fierce
barbaria~ns continued to be the sole judges in
their own cadek, their enim~ities were implacable
and immortrtal; threy set no hounds either to,
the degree of their vengeancle,· or to the dura.?
·tion of theirt referrtment. Th~e exe-~ges which this
occa3Eioned, proved to deftruA~ive of peace anda
o~rder. in soc~iet~y, as forced thlem to thinkr of some
remedy. At firfir, arbiters interpos~ed, and by per-
fixation or intreatyi prevailed on the party offend-
ed to accept of a fine or colmpoit~ion from the
ag~gressor, and to drop all far'ther prosecution.
But as fubmiijon to persons who had no legal
or mzagifferial Lu~thority was altogether volun-
tary, it became necessary to establish judges,
with power f~ufflicient to e-nforce their own de-
cifeins. The leader whom they w~ere accustom-
ed to follow and to obey, whose courage they
refpe~ed, and in whose integrity thley- placed
confldence, was the person to whom a martial
peopl~e naturally commnitted· this important pre-
rogative. Every chieftain was the commander
of his tribe in? war, and their judge in peace.
Every1 baron- led hi~s vaffls to' the field, and ads
minifferedi justice to them in his hall. Their
hig~h spirited dependants would not have rcecoge

J1 nized any other authority, or have s~ubmitted to

any other jurisdi~ion. But in times of turbu-
lence and violence, the exercif'e of this new fanc-
tion was attended not only with trouble, but
with danger. No person could aifume the cha-
radfer of a judge, if he did.not po~nef~s power
fufficient to proteat the one party from the vio-
lence of private revenge, and to compel the other
to acceept of such reparation as he enjoined. In
consideration of the extraordinarry efforts which
this of~ce required, judges, besides the fine
w~hich they appointed to be paid as a compen-
fa8tion to the person or family who had been
injured, levied an additional fim as a recom-
pence for their own labour; and in all the feu-
-dal kingdoms the latter was not only as preci-
fely ascertained, but as regularly exadted, as the
former.

The extent and ba~d effeaqs of this privilege.

Thus, by the natural operation of circum-

stances peculiar to the manners or political slate
of the feudal nations, separate and territorial
jlurisdi~tions came not only to be established in
everyr kingdom, but were established in such. a
'way, that the interest of the barons concurred
with th~eir ambition in maintaining and extend-
ing them. It was not merely a point of ho-
nour with the feudal nobles to dif~penfek juffice
to their vassals; but from the exercise of that
power arose one capital branch of their revenue;

atnd the emolumrents of their ~courts wvere fr-e-
quently the main support of their dignity. It
was with infinite zeal that they asserted and de-
fended this high privilege of their order. By
this infkitution, however, every kingdom in Eu-
jrope was split into as5 many fepaLrate principaHi-
ties as it contained powerful baroins. Their
vaff'als, whether in peace or in war, were hardly
·feniible of any authority, bu~t that of their fur-
pei-ior lord. They felt themselves fabjeac to no
other command. They were amenable to no
other jurisdi~tion. The ties which linked togre-
ther thes~e fmxaller confederacies became closet
and firms the bonds of public union relaxced, orr
wPJrere dissolved. The nobles 11rained their in.
vention in devising reg~ulations which tende~d to
afrcertain~ and perpetuate this diftin~tion. In
order to guard against: any appearance of fiabor-*
dination in their courts to those of the crown,
they constrained their monarchs to prohibit the
royal judges from entering their territories, or
from claiming any jurisdiaion there; and if,
either through mistake, or from the spirit of
encroachment, any royal judge ventured to ex-
tend his authority to the vassals of a baron, they
;night plead their right of exemption, and thre
lord of whom they held could not: only rescue
them out of his hands, but was intitled to legal
reparation for the injury and affront offered to
him. The jurisd~i~ion of the royal judges fecar-
cely reached beyond the narrow limits of the

king's demefn~es:. Instead of a regular gradation
of courts, aillacknowled ing the authority of
the fame general laws., and looking up to there
as the guides of their decilions., there were in
every feudal kingdom a thousand independent
trtibunals, the proceedings -ofwhich were dire&t-
ed by local cuffoms and contradi~ory forms.
The colliflon of jurifitiion among t~hese nu-
m~erous courts oft~en retarded the execution of
juffice: TIhe variety and caprice of their modes
of procedure must have for ever kept the ad:-
miniffration of it from attaining any degree of
uniformity or perfe~tion.

Exupedients employed uz ordes to limit or abol~ish it.

All t'he mo~narch~s of Euarope perceived there

encroachments on their jurif~di~ion, anrd bore

* them with impatience. But the ufurpations of

th~e nob~les were so firml~y established, and the
danger of endeavouring to overturn them by
open force was to manifest, that they were
obliged to remain fat'isfied with attempts toe
undermine them. ~Various expedients were
employed for this purpose ; each of which
merit attention, as they mark the progres~s of
law and equity in the f'everal kingdoms of Ea.
rape. At first, princes endeavoured to cir-
cumferibe thet jurifdi~tion of the barons , by
permitting them to take cognizance only of
Emaller' offences, reserving those of grear er mo.
ment, under the apellation of Pleas of the

CrPown

Crown, and Royal Caus~es, to be tried in the
king's courts. This assented only the barons
of inferior note ; the more powerful nobltis
scorned fiich a diftinaion, and not only claimed
uanlimited juxrifdiaion, but obliged their reviv-
reigns to grant th~em charters, conveying- or
recognizing this privilege in the most ample
form. The attempt,' neverthelei's, was pro-
du~ive of some good conf~eqiuences, and paved
the way for more. It turned the attention of
men towards a jurifdi~ion d'iftin&t fom that of
the baron whose vassals they were; it accustom-
ed them to the pretenilons of superiority
which the'crown claimed over territoria.1judges-;
and taughlt them, wh~eni oppress~ed by their own
superior lo~rd, to look up to; their fevereign as
their protentor. This facilitated the introduc-
tion of appeals, by which princes brought the
decisions of tire barons' ·court~s under the re-
view of the royal judges. While trial by com-
·bat fabfifted in full vigour, no point decided
according to that mode, could be brought une
der thre review of another court. It had beets
referred to the judgment of God; the il~ue of
'battle had: declared his will; and it would havie
been impious to have called in question thie
eqzi~t~y of the divine decision. ]But as s~oon as
that barbarous cuffom began to fallsinto difidue,
princes~encouraged by the vaffatls o~f the ·barons
to sure for redress, by appealing to the royal
'courts. Tlhe progress of this pradtice, howe-·

Hist, of Chart, V. Vol. I.! F

ver, was flow and gradual. The first initan-
ces of appeals were on account of the delay or
the refusal of jufkice in the barons' court ; and
as these wlere countenanced by the ideas of
subordination in the feudal confitattion, the
nobles allowed them to be introduced with~out
much opposition. ·But when these were follow-·
ed by appeals on account of the injuffice or
iniquity of the f~enterice, the nobles then be-
gan to b~e s~ensible, that if this innovation be-
cam~e general, the . hadowv of powier alone
would remain in their hands , and all real ju-
thorityv and jurifdi~tion would centre in those
courts wiichf .poffeffed the right of re-viewr. Thely
inf~tantlyT took the alarm, retmonftrated agrainft
the encroachnment, and contended~ boldlyT for
their ancient privileges. But the mon~archs in
thie dif~ferent kingdoms of Europe ,pursued their
plan writh fteadiniefCs and ,prudence. Though
forced to furfpend their operations on some o-c-
ca~iins, and seemin~gly to yield w~hen any for-
m'idable corifederac~y of their vassals united
against them, they resumed their meas~ures as
soon ·as they observed the nobles to be remiss
or. feeble, and bufihed them with vigour. They
appointed th1e royal courts, which origrinally
were ambulatory , and irregular with, refpe~c to
their tim-es of mee~ting-, to be he~ld in a fixed
,place, and at Rated seas~ons. 'They wtere soli-
citous to namne judges ·of mnore dist~ingui~shed
abilities than such as, presided in the courts of

the barons. They added dignity to their cha-
ra~ter, and splendour to their aLffemblies. They
lazboured to render their forms regular, and
their decrees consistent. Such juclicatories be-
came,· of course, the objeas of public confi-
dence as wrell as vieneraztion. The people,
relinquifhiing the partial tribunals of their lords,
were eag~er to bring every fubje~t: of ·contest~
~under the more equal and discerning eye of thoi
f~e whom their sovereign had chosen to give
judgment in his name. Thus kings became
once more the heads of the community, and
the difpenf~iers of juffice to their f~ubje~ts. The
barons, in some kingd oms, ceased to exercjife
-their right of juridi~tion, because it sTunk into
contempt ; in others, it was circumf'cribed by
such reg~ulations as rendered it innocent, or it:
was entirely abolished by express itatutes. Thus
the~ adminriffration of juffice taking its rife from
.one thuree, and following .one direEtion, held
its courf~ein every Rate with more uniformity,
and. with greater force. Z)

The pr~ogress of eccle~atical ufurpations.

In ages of ignorance-and credulity, the minif"-

ters of religion are the objeeas of fiperitit~ions
veneration. 'fWhen the bar'barians who` bver-rana
the empire first embraced the Chrifiian faith,
they found the clergy in po~fieffin ofcorlfiderable
pow~er; and they naturally transferred to those
new guides the profound fab~miillion and re-
verence which they were ac-customed to Yield to
the priest of that religion which they had for-
faken. They deemed their p~erions to be as fa-
cred as their fun~tion; and would have confi-
dered it as impious to faubje&t them to the pro-
fane jurifdic~ion of the laity, The clergy were

not blind to the advantages which the weakniefs
of mankind afforded them. They establish~ed
courts , in wh~ich every question relating to their
own charafter, their fun~tion, or their pro-
perty was tried. They pleaded, and obtained
an azlmoft total exemption from the authority of
civil judges. Upon different pretexts, and by
a multiplicity of artifices, they commnunicated
this privilege to so many persons , and extended
1:heir jur;fdiftion to .fuPch a variety of cafes, that
the g~reat~er part of those affairs which gave rife
to contest and litigation, was c'rawn under the
cogniz~ance of the fpliritual coutrts.

The plan of ecclefiaticall jurifprlldence more perfeR than that in

the civil c~ourts.

But in order to disp~ose the laity to fuffer

there usurp ations without mur~murng~ or oppo-
fition, it was neceffry to convince them, that
the adminiffration of juffice would be renderled
more pe~rfe~t by the eftablifhmnent of this nejir
jurifdi~tioai This was not a difficult undertaking,
;et the period when ehcclefiaflics carried on their
encroachments with the greate~st fuccers. That
scanty portion of science which ferred to guide
mzen in the ages of darkness,: was wholly~ en-
groffekd by the clergy. They alone were accu-
ftomed to read , to enquire , and to reafbn.
'Whatever knowl~edge of ancient: jurisprudence
had been preserved, either by tradition, or in
fuzch books as had escaped the deftraitive rag~e

of barbarians , was poffeffed only by .them.
Upon the maxims of that excellent fyfTiem, they
founded a code of laws consonant to the great:

, principles of equity. Being dire~ed bjr fixed

and known rules, the forms of the~ir courts were
ascertained, and their decisions became unifb~rm
and consiste~nt. Nor did they Avant authority
f~uffcient to enforce .their sentences. Excom4
muniication and other ecclefiaffical ced~ures ,
were punishments more formidable than any that:
civil judges could infliat in s~upport of th ch*
decrets.

The gaoo effe~ts ds imitating· and adopting it.

It is not surprising , then, that eccleiafti-

cal jurifprud ence thould become fuzch an obje~t
of admniration' and refped; thiat exemption from
civil juridi~ition wras courted as a privilege, and
conferred as a reward. It is n'ot surprising, that
even to rude people, the maxims of the canon
lawN th'ould appear more equal and just than that
-IP-digefked jurisprudence which dire~t~ed· all pro-
ceed~ings in the civil courts. Accordin~g to the
lat~ter, thle differences b~etween contending barons
were terminated, as in a state of nature, by-
-the [~word; according to the for~mer, every mat-
ter was fabjeated to the deciflon of laws. The
one, by permitting judicial combats, left chance
and force to be arbiters of right or wrong , of
truth or falsehood; the other, passed judgment
with refped to ther~e by the maxims of equity,

and- the testimony of witn~effe. Any error or
iniqluity in a featsence prpononced by a baron to·
whom feuda~l juridiition belonged, was -irr~eme-
diable, becaus~e originally it was faubjeat to the
review of no s~uperior tribunal; the eccleflaf~ical~
la w established a regular gradation of courts ,
through all which ac cause might be ca)rried by
appeal, untfil' it was deteim~in ed by that autho-'
ritfy which was h~el~d to be fa~preme in the church,
Thus the genius and principles of the canonl~awt
preparfyd men for approving .thbofe three great al,.
t~eratio~ns in the feudal jurisprudence which I have
mentihne-d. But it was not with refpea-to there
points al~one that the canon .law fixggefted: imn-
provements beneficial to faciety. Manty of the'
regulations,' now deemed the b~arriers of perfbl-
Snal fcurity , or the safeguards of private pro-
perty:, are contrary to the spirit, and repugnant:
to the mnaxlims of the civil jurisprudence, ·know~cn
in Europe during fiveral centuries, and were

ners an~d ideas of ~these fierce invaders. Th-ey
hadl rerpeft to objecks of which a r·ude people
had no conception; and were adapted to a state

ha~bitants of Euzrope dlignified with th~e name of

century , a copy of Juffinian's PandeC~s was ac-
cidentally discover-ed in Italy.

Circumffances which ~favoured the reviv;al of it.

By that time,, the slate of lo~ciety was to

far· advanced, an~d the ideas of men so much
enlarged and improved by the occurrences of

of .several centuries, during which. they ha &
contilnued in political union, that they were
~struck with admiration of a~- fyfitem which their
ancestors could not com~prehend. Though they
h'ad not hit-herto attained su~ch a degree~ of re-
Th~re~men~t, as to catch fromn the aincienrts a reli~h-
for true philosophy, -or speculative i'cience ;though
they were still insensible to the beauty and ele-
ganmce of classical comapofition; they were fIuffi-
clently qualified to judge with refpe~t to the
merit of their system of laws, in which all the
Ipoits most in~tereffing to mankind,- and the
chief obijeas of their attention in every age,
were fettled with djifcernment, precillon and
lequity. All2 men of letters ffudied this new
science with. eagernes~s; and within a few years
after the discovery of the Pande~s, profeffors
of civil law were appointed, who taught it
publicly in most countries of Europe.

The effeas of having faLch a perfe~t modelt

Iyien, as soon as they were acquainted with fix-
ed and general laws, perceived the advantag-e
of theml, and became impatient to ascertain the
principles and forms by which judges thouldl
regulate their decisions. Such was the ardour'
with which they carried on an undertaking of
so great importance to society, that, before the

close of the twelfth c~entury, the feudal law
was reduced into a regular fyiemir; the code of
canon law was. enlarged and methodized; and
the loofel unce~rtain cult~oms of difFer~entt provin-
ce~s or kingdoms were collefted and arranged
wAith an order and accuracy acquired from the
knowledge of Roman jurifprudnce. In fbme

TZhis was the state of Europe during several
centuries. Every gentleman, born a s~oldier,
scorned any other occupation; he was taught'
no f~ience but that of? war; even hiS e xercif~es
and pastimes were feats of martial pr~owers.
Nor did the judicial charadfer, which persons

had confirmed, and rendered refpenable; to

ihounce whether it had been conidu~ted according
to the Isws of arms; included every thing that
a baron,~ who ate~d as a. judge, fo-und it necef-

The eff~eas of thisS · on focietycs

B~t: when. the ~forms~ of legal proceedings

were fixed, wThen the rules of decision were
committed to writing, and colle~ed into a body,
law became a f~cienee, the knowledg~e of which
required a. regular course of fludy, together
with long attention to -the pradtice of courts.

Mlartial and itllterate no~bles, had netither leisure
nor inclination to undertake a talk so laborious,
as well. as s~o foreign from all the occupations
which they deemed entertaining, or fauitable to
their rank. They gradually relinqui~shed their
plfaces in courts of juffice, where their igno-
r-ance expofekd them ~to contempt. They became
weary of attending to the ditedi~on of cafes,
which grew too intricate for them to- compre-
hend. Not only the judicial determination of
pointsiwhich were the fuibjea of controverity,
but the condu~t of all legabl bufine~fk and tr~anf-
ac~tions was committed to persons trained by
previous fludy and application to the knowledge
of law. ~An order of men, to whom their.
fellow -citizens had daily recourfhe for advice,
and to whom they looked up for decision in
their most important concerns, naturally acquir-
ed con~sideration and influence in s~ociety. They?
wTere advanced to honours which had been coni
fidered as the peculiar rewards of military virtue.
They were entrafted with offices of the highest:
dignity, and rnoft: extensive power. Thus, ano-

The sp~irit of chivalry introduces more liberal sentiments , and

VIII. While improvements, fb important

with refpeRt to the slate of faciety and the ad-
ministration of juffice, gradually made progress
in Europe, sentiments more liberal and. gene-
roas haLd begun to animate the no~bles.Thef~e were
inspired by the spirit ofthivalry, which thou-gh
considered, commonly, as -a wild institution,
the effe·t of caprice, and the s~ource of extrava-
gance, arose naturally from the ffate'af socIety at
that period, and had a very serious influence in
refining -the manners of the European nations.

Origin of Chivalry.

The feudal ffate was a slate of perpetual war:,

rapine, and anarchy ; during which the weaks and
unarmed; were exposed every moment to insults or
inju~ries. The power of the sovereign was too
limited to prevent ther~e wrongs; and the admi-
niffration of juffice too feeble to redress them.
There was fearcely any proteAIon against vio-
lecae and oppreiffon, but whtat the: valour and
generosity of private persons afforded. The fame
spirit of enterprise which had prompted t~o many
gentlemen to take arms in defence of the o -
pressed pil~grims in P-aleffine, incided others to
declare themselves the patrons and avengers of
injared innocence at home. When the final re-
du~tion of the Holy Land under the dominion
of infidels prit an end to thelb foreign expedi-
tions, the latter was the only employment left;

for the adtivity and courage of adventurers. To
check the insolence of overgrown oppressors;
to foccour the diffreffed ; to res~cue the helpless
.from captivity; to proted, or to avenge wo-
mnen, orphans, and ecclefiaftics, who could not
hear arms in their ·own defence;. to redref-
wrongs, and to remove grievances; were deemn-
·ed adts of the highdkt prowess and merit.
Valour, humanity, court&fy, justice, honour,
were the chara~~erific qualitieS of divalry. To
tkhefe wvere added religion, which mingled itself
wyith every pafflron and institution during the
msiddle ages, and by infufling a larg-e proportion
of enthufiiflic zeal, g~ave them s~uch force, as
carried them to romantic excess. IVien were
·trained to knighthood by a long previous dif~ci-
pline; they were admitted into the order by
folemnnities no les~s devout than pompous; every
person of noble birth court~ed that honour ( it
was deemed a diftin~ion s~uperior to royalty;
and monarchs were proud to receive it fromi
the 'hands of private gentlemen.

'is beneficial effeatS,

This flagul~ar institution, in which valour,

gallantry, and religion, were t~o firangely blend-
ed, was wonderfully adapted to the taste and
genius of martial nobles; and its effe~:s were
soon visible in their manners. War was car-
ried on with lets ferocity, wihen humanity came
to be deemed the ornament of knighthood no

less than courage. M~ore gentle and poliifhed
manner~s were introduced, when courtefyT was
~recomzmended as the most amiable ofknightly
virttues. - Violence and oppression decreased ,
'when it ~was reckoned meri-torious to check
and to punith them. A frcrupulouas ad~heren-
ce to truth , ·with the most religious at~ten-
tion to ful'fil: every engagem~ent~, became the
dift~'inguifh~2ing c'haradteriftic of a g~entleman, be-
cause chivalry was regarded as the ftihool of
honour, and -incculct~ed ·th~e most delicate feni-
Aibility with refpea to that point. The adnxi-
ration of these .quaiti~es, together with the high
diftin~tions and ·prerogatives conferred on knight-
io'od in every part -of Europe, inspired perf~onsi
of noble birth on fbrme ocealnii~rs wi~th a fpeciest
of milit~ary fanaticifmi,- and led them ·to extra-
vagaLnt enterprises. Bu~t th~ey deeply imprinted
on their minds the principles of generosity and
hono~ur. These were firengthened by every
thin~g that can :affed ~the sens~es, or touch the
heart. The wlild exploits of thos~e romantic knights
?who sallied forth i~n quest of adventures, are
wnill known., and have been treated with pro-
per· ridicule. The political and permanenrt effek~s
sos the spirit of chivalry have been less observed.
Perhaps, the hut~manity which accompanies all
the operations of war, . t~he' refinements of gal-·
lanitry, and the point of honour, the: three chief
circumffances which dif~tinguif'h modern from
ancient manners, may be aferibed in a great:

measure to this whimsical in~itution, f'eemingly
of little benefit to mankind. The fesntiments
which chivalry inspired, had a wonderful in-
fluence on manners and conduC2 during the
twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
centuries. They were so deeply· rooted, that
they continued to operate after the vigour and
reputation of the institution itself began to de-
cline. Some considerable tranfa~tions, record-
ed in the following hiitory , refembly the ad-
venturous exploits of chivalry, rather than the
well regulated operations of found policy. Some
of the most eminent personages, whos~e chara~ters
wKill be delineated, were firongly· tin~tured w'it~h
this romantic spirit. Francis I. was ambitions
to diftinguifCh himfelfby all the qualities of an ae-
complithed knight, and endeavoured to imitate
the enter~prising genius of chivalry in war, as
well as its pomp and courtesy during peace.
The fame which he acquired by these splendid
aations, so far dazzled his more temperate ri-
val, that he departed on s~ome occafrons from
his udual prudence and moderation, and emulat-
ed Francis in deeds of prowess, or of gal-
lantry. DD)

rope, during several centuries, in that slate of
ignorance which has been already defecribed.
But .the events and inflitutions which I halve
enumerated, produced great alterations in so-
clety. As soon as their operation, in refforing
liberty and independence to one part of the com-
munity, began to be felt; as soon as they began
to communicate to all th~e mnembers of society
some tasse of the advantages arising froin com-
merce, from public order, and from personal
s~ecurity, thie human mind became conscious of
powersvhich it did not formerly perceive, and
fond of occupations or Ipurftlits of which it was
formerly incapable. Towards the beginninig of
the twelfth century, we dircern the first fy~mp-
toms of its awvakening from that leth argy in which
it had been long funk, and observe it turning
with curiosity and attention towards new objeats.

The first literary efforts iill- Eireted , and~ the caufecs of this.

The firftliterary efforts, however, of the

European nations in the middle ages, were ex-
tremely ill dire~ted. Among nations, as well
as individuals, the powers of imagination attain
some degree of vigour before the intelleaual fa-
culties are much exrercifed in speculative or ab-
ftra& disquisition. Men are poets before they
are philosophers. Thiey feel with sensibility·,
and deferibe with force, when they have made
but little progress in inveffig~ation or reasoning.
The ag~e of Homer and ofHefiod long preceeded

that of Thales, or of Socrates. But, unhap-
pily for literature , our anceffors:, deviating from
this course wMhich nature points out, plung~ed
at once into the depths of ·abffruie -and meta--
.physical inquairy. They had- been converted to
·the Christian faith, soon after they fettled in
their n~ew conquests. But they did nots receive
it: puxre. The prefumrption of men had added to
the simple and i~nfiru~ive do~t~rines of Chriffia-
nity the theories of a vain philosophy, that
attemptedl to psenetrate into inyferies, and to
dLecide queftion~swhich the ~iminted faculties of
·the humnan inind are unable 'to; comprehend, ·or
io resolve. There over - curous speculations
were incorporate-d with the iTyfiem of religion,
and. came to be c~onsidered as tche mcoft essential
part of it. As soon, then, as cur~iosity promnpt-
ed men to inqurire and to reas~on, there, were
the f~ubjeats ;which Id~irf present ed themselves,
and engaged· their attention. The f'chola~ftic
theology, with its infinite train of bold difqlul-
fitions, and furbtile dift·in~tions concerning points
which are not the objec2 of human reason, was
the first produ~tion of the spirit of` inquiry after
it began to refame some degree of adtivity and
vigour in Europe. It was not this circumflfance
alone that g~ave fuxch a wrong turn to the minds
of men, wthen they began again to exercise ta-
lents which they had to long negle~-ed. Ms
of the perifons who attempted to revive literature
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, had

G z

received infkrtiion, or dlerived ~th~eir .pr~nci~ples
of fiecince from th~e Greeks in the eastern Emn-
pire, or from t~he Arabians in Spain and Africa.
Both ther~e people, jlcute and inquisitive to ex-
Cess, corrupted thoke feiences which they cul--
tiv~ated. The former renddered theology a fyfitem
of speculative refire~men-t, or of endless contro-
verty.The lastter communicated' to philosophy afpi-
rit of maetaphyfical atnd frivolous fabtlety. 1Mified
by there guides, the persons who firkt applied
to fe~ience rwq"re involved In ai maze of inutricate
inquirties. Instead of allowviing thb~ir fancy to
take its natural range, and to produce fach
woirks of invention as mright have improved their
taste~, and re~fined their sentiments; instead of
cultivating those arts which embellish humani
life, andi renfderi it comnfort;Shle; they ·we~re set-
tered by authority, they were led ·afkray~ byi
example, and wasted the wihole· force of their
genius in speculations as unavailing as-they were
dlifficult.

They had , ho~iewer, considerable effeas.

But fruitless andE ill-dire~ted as ·t~h~ere` pe-

culations were, their novelty rotczedi and their
boldness laterefted the hiumanl mind. The ar-;
dour with wNhich men pursued thos~e uninviting
itudie~s, was afktonifhing. Genuine philosophy
wa~s never cultivated , in any enlightened age,
with more zeal. Schools, upon the model of
~thos~e infkituted by Charlemagne, were opened

in every cathedral, and almost: in every, monal
fIery of note. Colleges and universities were
ere~ed, and formed into communities or corpo-
rations, governed by their own laws , and in-.
vested with separate and extensive jurif~di~tion
over their own members. A regular courf~ie of
fftudies yvas planned. Privileges of great value
Iwere conferr~ed on mast-ers and feholers. Aca,
demical titles and honours of various kinds were
invented as a recompenf'e ·forboth. Nor was it
in the fichools alone that superiority in s~cience
led to reputation and authority; it became on
obje&t of refpedt in life, and advanced- Arch as
acquired it to a rank of no inconsiderable emi-
nence. Allured by all there advantages , an
incredible number of' ffudents resorted to those
new feats of learning, and crowded with eager-
ness into that new path which was opened to
fame and difi~tinion.

A circumflance which prevented their being more extensive.

But how considerable soever· ther~e first es-

fort~s -may appear, there was one cir~cumstance
which prevented the effecas of them from being
as extensive as they ought to have been. ~All
the languages in Europe , during the period
under review , were barbarous. They w~ere
destitute of elegance , of force , and even of
perspicuity. No attempt: had ·been hitherto made
to improve or to polish them. The Latin tongue
was conf'ecrtated by the church to religion, Cf-C

tom, with authorit~y fearcely les~s sacred, had
appropriated it to literature. All the f~iciences
cu-ltivated in the twielfth and. thirteenth centu..
ries , were taug-ht -in Latia.- All books with
refpe £t to them were written in that language.
T~o have treated of any important fubje~t in a
modern language, would have heeir deemed a
degt~adation of it. This confined s~cience within
a very narrow circle. The learned alone-were
admitted into the temple of knowledge ; the
gate was tCha;t againit-all others , who were
allowed to remain involved in their fo~rm~er
darkness and ignorance.

broken into many separate communities. The
intercouarfe betve~en these divided slates, ceased

Cautes of its revival.

Various causes, however , contributed to

revive the spirit of comme'rce, and to reniew,
in fofme degree, the idterco~urfe -between diiffer-
enat nat-ions. The Itaians, by their conneation
with Cloniantinople, and other cities of the
Greek empire, :had prese~rved in their own coun-
try some relish for the precious commodities
and curiolis manusfaaures of the Eakt. They
commtunicated s~ome knowledge of therfe to the
crounttries co~nfigaous to Italy.. 'Bt this com-

anerc-e was extremely limited, nor was the in-
tercourfe wrhich it occafionedC between different
nations considerabl~e. The Crsfades, by lead-
ing multitudes from every corner~ of Europe into
Asia, opened a more extensive comm-ianication
betwreen the East .and Wef~t, which ;iubfifCted
~for two centuries; and though the obje~t of
ther~e .ex editions was conquest and not com-
rnerce; though the iflue of them proved as un-
fortunate, as the motives for undertaking them
were wvil~d and enthufaiftic, their commercial
effe~ts, as hath been hre~wn, were both bene-
ficial and permanent. During the continuance
of the Crusades, the great cities in Italy , and
in other countries of Europe, acquired liberty ,
and together with it fisch privileges as rendered
them ref~peatuble and independent co4mmunities.
Thus, in every slate·, there was forined a new
order of citizens, to whom commerce presented
itself -as their proper- objeft, and opened to them
a certain path to wealth and dignity. Soon a~fter
the close of the Holy War, the m~ariver's com-
pass w~as invented, which, by rendering nav~i-
g~ation more s~ecure as well as more adventrousJ
facilitated t~he communicadioli be~tween remnote
nations, and br~ought them nearer to each other,

First among the Italians.

The Italian States, during the f~ame period,

di~ablithed a regular commerce with the East in
the ports of Egypt; and drew from thence all

the rich produd~s of the Indies. They introl-
Iduceed into their own terri-tories mnanufa~tnres of
-variouLs kinds, and carried.them on with great
ing~enuity and vigour. They attempted new
arts;- and traEnfplan~ted from warmer chimates,
-to which they had been hitherto deemed pecu-
liar, reveral natural produations which now
fE-rtifih the mat~erials of a; lucrative and extended
-commerce. AL- these cormmodities, whether
imported from Asia, or produced by their own
-skill, they difpofb~d of to great advantage among
-the other people of Europe, who began~ to ac-
~quire some taste of elegance unknown to their
anc~fkors, or despised by them. During the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries , the commerce
of Europe was almost entirely in the hands of
the Italians, more commonly known in those
ages by the name of Lombards. Companies or
societies of Lom~2bar'd merchands f~ettled in every
different king~dom. They were taken under the
immediate proteaion of the f'everal governments.
They enjoyed extensive privileges and immuni-
ties. The operation of the ancient barbarous
laws concerning firangers, was futpended with
re~fpeft to them. They became the carriers '
- the manufaaurers , .and the ·bankers of all
Europ e.

Then by the means of the Hanfeatick.

Wlhile the Ittalians, in the south of Europe,

culltivated traide with s~uch. industry and fa~ccersz

the commercial [pirit awakened in the North to-
wards the middle of the thirteenth century.
As the nations around the Baltick were, at that:
time, extremely 'barbarous, and infested that
sea with their piracies , the cities of Lubec~k
and H~am'burgh, .floon after they began to open
some trade with there people, found it necessary
to enter into a league of m~utual defence. They
derived fruch advantages from this union, that
other towns acceded to their confederacy, and,
in a thort time , eighty of the most considerable
cities; s~cattered through those vast countries
which firetch from lthe bottom of the Baltick to
Cologne on the RPhine, joined in the famous
Hanf~eatick league, which became ~o formidable,·
that its al~liance was courted, and its enmity
was dreaded by the greatest monarchs. The
members of this powerful association formed the
first: fyfiematick plan of commerce known in the
middle ages, and condu~ted it by common iaw~s
ena~ed in their general assemblies. They sup-
plied the ·reft of Europe with naval sores, and
pitched on diffejrent towns, the most eminent
of which was Bruges in Slanders, where they
established flaples in which their commerce was
regularly carried on. Thither the Lombards
brought the produtions of India, together with'
the inanufaaures of Italy, and exchanged them
for the more bulky, but not lef's useful commo-
dit~ies of the North. The Hanfieatick .merchants
disposed of the cargoes which thtey received

fr·om the Lombairds, in the ports of the Baltick,
or carried them uip ~the great rivers into the in-
terior parts of Germany.

Commerce m~akes progrel~s in the Netherlands.

T~his regular intle~rourf~e opened between

the nations ·in the North and South of Europe,
made them iAinfi~ble of their mutual wants, and.
created such newu and vast demands for commod-
ditiess of every kind, -that it excited among the
inhabitants of thie Netherlands a, more vigoroass
spirit in carrying ·on the two great ananufadtures
of wool and flax, w~hich se~em to have been
considerable irr that country as far back as the
-age of Charlemagne. As Bruges became the
cen~tre of comnmunicati~on between ~the Lo~mbard
and Ha~nfeaticki merchands, the -Flemings traded
with both in that city to f uch extent as well as
advantage , as spread amdjng* them a general
ha~bit of -induffry, wh~ich long rendered Sla~nders-
and the adjacent· provinces the most opulent ,
the most populous, a~nd best cultivated coun-
tries in Eulrope.

A-nd in Eng~land.

Stru~ck wirith the flouri~h~ingr state of thes~e

provinces, of which he dis~cerned the tru~e catxfe,
Edtward III. of England endeavour~ed to excite
a spirit of induffry among his own fubjets ,
who, blind to the advantages of their iituation,
and ignorant of the source frorn which opulence

was; dest~ined to flowk into their country, ~ere
.so little attentive to their~ commercial interest,
azs hardly' to attempt thfibe, manufaafture9,_ the
.matrerials of which they furnit~hed to foreigners.
By alluring Flemith, artisans to f~ettle in his do-
minions, a's well as by many wife laws for the;
cencouragemen~t: ad regulation of trade, Edward
gave a b~eginning to the woollen m~anuf~a~tures
of Engla~nd,l and first turned the adtive and en.-
terprizing genius of his people towards those
arts whidh: have rai-sed the English to the high-
ieft rank amiong comlmercial nations.

The b~eneficial efefefs of this.

This Increase of commerce, and of inter.

course between nations , how inconsiderable
soever it: may appear in refpedt of their rapid.
and extensive progress during the last and pre-
f~ient age, seems vast, when we compare it withi
the slate of both in Europe previous to the
twelfth cenfury. It did not fail of producing
great effe~s. Commerce tends to wear off~thof~e
prejudices which maintain diftindi~on and ani-
moiity· between nations. It f'oftens and polishes
the manners of men. It unites them by one
of th e fkrongeft of all ties, the d efire of sup -
plying their mutual wants. It dis~poses them to
peace, by eftablithing in. every itate an order.
bs citizens bound by their interest to be the
guardians of public tranquillity. As soon as
the commercial spirit begins to adquire vigour,

and to gain an ascendant in any society., we
diEf~cover a new genmus mn its policy, its allian~-
ces5, its wars, and its negociations. Confpi-
cuouzs proofs; of this occur in the history of the
Italian States, of the, Han~teaic leaguae, and
~the cities of the NJeth~erlands during the period
und~er review.: In pro~portion as- comme~-rce ma-
de its way into the different: countries' of
Europe , they faccefilvely turned their at-
tention to thos~e orbjwafs, and adopted those
maniners, which occupy and diftinguifrh polithed
nations. GG)

View of the Prog~reth of Societ~y in Europe,

with reipeft to the command of the nation-
al iforce requifilte in foreigrn operations.

StafRte of society greatly improved at th·e beginnling of the fifteen~th

ceultury,

Sveh are the events and institutions, which,
bZy their pow~erful operation, contributed gra-
dually to introduce more regular government
and more polithed manners; into the various na.

tions of Eu~rope. WThen we survey the slate of
fiociety, or the charader of individuals , at the.
opening of the fifteenth century,. and then turn
back to view the condition of both at the time
wvhen thae barbaro~us tribes, which overturned the
Roman power, completed their settlement in
-their new conquests, the progres~s which' man..
kinmd had made towards order and re~finement~
will appear immense.

Still defeaive with refpe& to t~he command of the national fo~rce.

Government, however, was still far from

having attained that slate, in which extensive
monarchies a&t with united vigour, or carry~ bit
great undertakrings with pjerf~everance and fauc-
cers. Small tribes or communities , even
in their rudeR state may operate in con-
cert, an~d exert their utmost force. They
are excited to a&; not by the diffant objeas
or the refin'ed s~pecula~tions, whiich interest or~
affe& men in poli~shed societies , but byr their
present feelings. The in~sults of an enemy
kindle: res~entment; the facucefis of a rival tribe
awakens emulation : these pafi~ions communic-
catee from breaRf to breast, and all the members
of the comnmunity, wvith united ardour, rufhi
into the field in order to gratifyr their revengej
or to acquire diftin~tion. But in widely ex-
tended Rtates , fuzch as the great kingdoms of
Europe at the Beginning of the fifteenth cen-
turry , where there is little intercourse betwreen

the:

thle distant members of the community, and
w~here every great enterprize requires previous
concert and long preparation, nothing can rou-
fe and call forth their united firength, but the
ahfol-ute command of a. desp~ot, or the power-
fual infhience gs reg~ulr policy. Of the former,
the vast empires in the East are an example;
~the irresistible mandate of the s~overeign reaches
the ~most remote provinces of his dominions,
and compels whatever number of his f~ubjeas
he is pleased. to summon, to foll~ow~ his Ran-
dard. The kingdoms of Europe, in the pre-
sent age, are an instance of the latter ; the
prince, by the less violent, but no lef's effec-
tual operation of laws and a well -regulated
government, is en~abled to avail himfrelf of the
w~hole force of his state, and to employ it in
enterprizes which require fkrenous and perfbver-
ing es for ts.

The poawer of monarchs very limited.

But, at the opening of the fift~eenth centu-

ry, the political constitution in all the kingdoms
of Europe was very diff~erent from either of
there states of godvernment. Th-e ~e~veral mol
na~rchs, though they hlad ibmewhat enlarged
the bo~undaries of prerogfative by fauccef'sful en-
croachments on the imm~unities and privileges
of thre nobility, wlere poff'e~lld of an authority·
extremely limited. The laws and interior po--

Their armies unfit for enoqlueft

As the revenues of princes were incofii-i

derable, the armies wvhich they- coul~d bring;
into the field -trere urnfit foi .long~ and eFfeatual

fervce. nfca~d of being: able to eplor~ly troops

trained to fkilil inl arms, and to mlilitary faibor-
dination, by reguljr discipline, mnonarchs were
obli~ged· to depend on farch forces as the~ir vassals
conduke~td to their ftanldard in cons~equence of
their military tenures. Theirie, as they were
hbound to remain under arms only for a t~hort
timei could not march far fromt th eir auical

phoce of residence, and being· more ·attach~ed to
the lord of wJho'm they held , than to the so-
vereig~n whom they served, were often as. muchz
difpofred to countera&t as to forward his fche-
mes. Nor were they, even if they had been
more fixbjea to the command of the monarch,
proper instruments to carry into execution any
g~reat and arduous enterprize. The firength
of ati: army, formed either for eonqueft: or de-
fence, lies in infantryi To the flability and
discipline of their leg~ions, confiftinig chiefly -of
infantry, the Romats, during the times of the
republick, were indebted fb~r all their vi~ories ;
and when their defe~endants, forgretting the inc
flitutions wrhich had led- them to univerfatl do;

to place their principal confidence in a nlume-
rous cavalry, the undifrciplined impetuosity of

foot, was f~uficient, as I have already obfervede
to overcome them. 'Thefe nations, soon after
they fettled in their newl conquests, uninfiru&-·
ed by the fatal e ~ior of the Romans, relin-
quifhed the cufto 1s of their anceffors, and
converted the chief force of their: armires into
cavalry. Among the R2omans this chang~e was
occaiion~ed by the effeminacyT of their troops,
wiho could not enldure the fatigues~ of s~ervice,
which their more virtuous and hardy anceftorse
fufftained with ease?. Amnong the people who
ei~ablifhed the new monarchies into which

Europe was div~idedi this innovation ih itti~li-
taryi difbipl~ine ~seems to have flow~ed fromi the
pride of the nobles, who s~corning to mihgle!
with persons of ihferioi: rank, aimed at beings
diftingulfhed from them~ in the fieldi as well
as during peace. The institution of ·`hivalry,
and thie ftequency of tournaments, in which
knights, in complet-e alimour, entered the lifts:
on hoarfebackg wjith exttaordinary fpidndoar i
di'fplaying amiazing addrers, and forcej a valourj
brought cavalry into £till g~reater eficem. The
fonidnels for th~at service incre~ated to sauch ai
degriee, that, during the thlirteenth aind four-
teenth centuries, the armies of Europe were
compofbd8 almost entirely of cavialry. NTo gentl
lentran would appear in the field but o~n. horse-
back. To fCerve in any other manner, he would
Ihave deemed der-ogatory to his rank. The ca-i
valry, by way of diftindfion, was called The
biat~tle, and on it alone depended the fate of
every ashion. The; infantry,` colleated from
the. dregs and refus~e of the people, ill - armed
and worse disciplined, wvas~ no account.

They are incapablre of forining· anly general or ext~enfriv plan of

o e~rtion.

As. thiere circumfianes tendered the opei

rations of particular king~doms less considerable
and less vigorous, fe they long kept the princes
of Europe from giving s~uch attention to the·
fehemes and ·tranfa~tions of their neighbours;,

as led thiem to form any reg~ular ijyfiem of pu-
bjlic s~ecurity. They prevented them from unit--
ing in confedera~cy, or frorn a~ting with cont
.ccert, in order to eli.ablifh fa~:ch a. diffribution
an'd 'balance. of power, as tChould hinder any
itate from rising .to a fg~periority, which migh]t:
e~ndangrer the generail liberty anzd independlence.
During s~everal centuries, the nations of Euro-
pe appear to have considered themselves as f~e-
parate societies, fearcely conne~ted. together
b~y any common interest, and. little concerned
in each others' affhit: or operation's. An ex-
tensive ·commnerce did no~t afford them an o~ppor-
tunityI of obfer ving aind periktratingr into the
schemes of every diff~erent sl~ate. They had
not ambassa~dors :residing const~antly in every
court to wratch and give early intellig'ence of
all its motionS. Thae expe~ation of 'remote
a~dvantages, or the profpee? of difiantl and con-
t'ingent ev 1s, were liot Cfuficient to excite na-
tions to takie arms.' The only, who were:
within thle fphiere of imnmediate dang-er, and
unavoida~bly exposed to injury or insult, thought
thiemfelves interested in any contest, or bound
to takze precautions fr their; own safety.

They were little connette4 with each other.

~Whoever records ~the tranfa~tions of an~y

of the` more conifderable Europeian slates during
the twvo last ceiaturies, muft' write ·th~e h~iftry
of Europe. Ity vrarious khangdoms, throughouat

that periiodt,have been formed into one great'r
Eyftem, so clo~Fey united , that each holding a
determinate Ration, the operations of one are
so felt by all, as to influence lb eir coun~sels and
regulate their meafa~res. But previ~ou~s to the
fifteenth century, unless when vicinity of ter-
ritory rendered the occaflons of dis~cord frequent
a~nd unavoidable , or when nationral emullation
fomented or embittered the frpirit of hoffility,
the atsairs of d~ifferentr countries are s~eldom in-
te~rwoven. In ·each kingdom of Europe grieat
events and revolutions happene~d, which the
other powers beheld with almoff the fame indif-
fereene as if the had been uninterefied Ope~ta-
tors, to whom the ·effe~t of t~he~e' tranfa~ationis
could never exte~nd.

AL confirmation of this from the affairs of France,

During the violent ftriggles between France

and Englaid , and notwithstanding the ala~rm.-
ing progress whi-ch was made towards render-
ing one prince the master off both thef*= king·-
doms, hardly one measure, which can be con-
fidered as the result of a s~agacious and~ prudent
policy, was formed in ·order to: guard againft'
an e'uent to fatal to Europe. The dtukes of
Burgundy and Bretagne, whom their situation
would not piermit: to'remain neutral, engaged,
it is true, in the conteit; but in 'ta~king their
part, they seem rather to have followed the
impuls~e of their pailions , than to have been

gui~ided by any just discernment of the danger
w7hich threatened themselves and the tranquil-
litiy of Elurope. The other princes, ~ fleemingly
unaffe~ed by the alternate facceffes of thq
contending p~art~ies , left them to decide the
quarr~el,- or interposed only by ' feeble' andiS ins
-effe~tual neg~ociations.

From those of Spain.

N~ot:withffanding the perpetual hoitilities ine

~which the vakious kingdoms of Spain were enl
gaged during fevreral centurires,adth cef
five occurrences which vrifiblj· 'tended to
rlnite that part of the continent into one great~
monarchy, the princes ~of Europe fecarcely tooki
a single fiep, vcihich discovers that they gave
any -attentiori to that important event. Tre
Permitted a powrer to aji~ife imiperceptibly , and
to acqiuire fItrengt~h there , which s~oon b~ecame
formidable to all its neighbours.

From thos~e of Germtany.

Aimidft t~he violent convulfiona Js lih which

the spirit of domrination in the Se-e of Rome,
and the turbulent anirbition of the Gerpnan` no-
bles, agitated the ·empire:, neither thre authori-
ty of the popes, seconded by allg th~eir artifices
and intriguzes,` nor the folicitations of the em-
perors, could induce any of the powerful mo-
irarchs in Europe to engage ifi thelk quiarrel,
or' io avail themfelveis of many' favoxiralile op.

portunitica of interposing with effe& and advan-
-tage.

This inadtivit~y occalloned entirely by the slate of g~overnment.

This amazing ina~tivity, during tranfa~tions

fb interesting, is not to be imputed. to any in-
capacity of difceering their political conf~eque~n-
ces. The power of judging with sag~acity, an
of ading with vigour, is the portion of men in
every age. The monarchs who reigned in the
different kingdoms of Europe , during several
centuries, were not blind to their particular in-
tereif, negligent of the public safety, or fkran-
gers to the method of securing both. If they
did not adopt that salutary fyfitemn, which tea-
shes modern politicians to tikre the alarm at:
the profpedt of difiant ·dangers, which prompts
~themn to checkr the fi~rst en~croachments of any
formidable power, and which renders each ftLate
the guardian, in some degree, of the rig~hts
and independence of all its neighbours, this -was
owiing entirely to faceh imperfe~tions and difor-
dlers in the civil government of each country ,
as made it impofib~tle for sovereigns to aRt faita.
b]y· to those ideas, which the poss ure of affairs ,
and their own observation, must have fuggeited.

Events happened during the zjth century ,which render the

efforts of navigations more powerful and extensive.

But during the course of the fifteenth cen-

tury, various events happened, which, by giv-

ing princes .more entire comrmand of the force
in their refpe~tive dominions , rendered their
operations more vigorous and extensive. In
cons~equence of this, the affairs of different king·-
doms becoming mrore frequently as well as more
intimately conne~ted , they were gradually aci
tufkomed to a~t in concert and· confederacy, and
were insensibly 'prepared for forming a system
of policy, in order to eftabliih or to preserve
such a balance of power as was most ~consistent
with the general security. It was during the
reign of Charles the Fifth, that the ideas, on
wh~ich this ijyftem is founded, firit came to be
fully understood. It was then, that the ma-
xims by which it has been uniformly maintain-
ed since that 2era , were univer~sall-y adopted.,
On thiis account a view of the causes and events
wvhich contribtuted to effa~blifh~ a plan of police,
more fCalutary and extensive than any that has
·taken place in the condu~t ~of human affairs, is
not only a necel~ary introdu~tion to the follow-
ing work , but is .a capital obj~en in the his~
tor ~of Europe.

The firlt of there was the depriving the EngTith of their territcr-

ries on the continent.

The ftirft event, that occasioned any confli-

derble alteration in the arrangement of affairs
in Europe, was the annexation of the extensive
territories, whic~h Eng~land poffeffed on the con-
tinent, to the crown of France, While the

4 ·Eng~lish were rnasfters of f'everal of~ thne most~ ser-

tile' and opulent provinces in France , arnd a
grea~t part of its most martial inhabitants was
bound to follow their Rtandardi, an Einglifh mo'
narch confiderred~ himself ra~thet; as thle rival
than aLs the vassal of the fe~ver~eign of -whom he
held. The kin~gs of France, circuyrfcribed and
thw~arted in their- schemes an~d operakI-ons by an
adverf'ary~ no less j-ealous than formidable, durit
not venture up~on any enterprize of importance
or of difficulty. TThe English vire-re always at:
hand , ready to oppoCe' them., -TheyT disputed
·evenm their rig~ht to their crowsn, and ·being able
to penetrate, with eaf'ie, into the heart of the
ki'ngdom , could a~rm against them thofei very
-hands which ought ·to 'have been employled in
their de~fence. Timrid counfllks anmd feeble efg-
-forts were naitpral 'to mnonarc~hs in faLch a fituaL-
tion. Fr~ance , difmnembtered and ov~erawed,
could not attain its proper RLat~ion in the ifyfemn
of Euzrope. But the death of Henry V. of Eng-
land, happily for France, and not unfortunate-
ly for his own country , delivered the FEi~nch
from the calamity of having a foreign master
seated on ~their throne. The` weakne's' of a
long minority, the diffentions in the, Englis~h
court, together writh the uniteady and languid
condua which there occalloned,. afforded the
French a. favourable opportunity 'of recovering
the territories which they had lot.' The nativ2
vralour of the Fren ih nojbility,· heightehned ~to a~n

enthufiafic confidence, by a supposed interpo-
fition of heaven in their behalf; condu~t~ed in
She field by fCkilful leaders; and dire~ted in the
cabinet by a· prudent monarch ; wras- exverted
wvith fach vigour and foccefs, d~uring this fa-
trouraLble jundture, as not only wreffed from
she EngFlith their new conquests, but fiript themr
of their ancient poaffeffons in France, and reduc-
ed therI within the narropr precinas of Calais
and its petty territory.
The effe&E of this on increasing the power of the French mo-

narchy.''

~As soon as to many consider~able provinces:

·vere reunited to their` domijnions, tlhe kring~s
of France , · conf'cious of this acqulfition of
firexigth, b~ega~n to form bolder s~chemes of in-
terior policy, as well as of foreign operations.
They immediately 1wcame formidable to their
xieig~hbours, wh~o began to fix their attention
on th~eir measures and motions, t~he importance

N~or was Fran ce indebted for this increase of

importance merely to the reunion of` the pro-
vinces which had been torn from it. A circumi-
stance attended the recovery of therfe, which`,
th~ough less con~sidera~ble, and less observed, con-
tributed not a little to give additional vigour and
decision to all the e~fftorts of that tnonatrchy. DuS-
ing the - obstinate flruggles bet~weenm Fra ce and
England, all the defeas of the military ryftem
under the feuadal government were sensibly felt.
A war of long continuance languifhedi, when
carried on by troops bound and accuffomned to
keep the field only for .a few weeks. Armies~,
composed chiefly of heavy-armed cavalry., were
unfit either for the attack or the defence of the
many -towFns and caffles, which it became necef-
faryv to guard or to reduce. - In order to obtain
such permanent and effec~ive foree, as became re-
quifite during th efe lengthened conteks , the kingsa
of Fra-he took into their pay considerable bands
of mercenary soldiers, levied sometimes among
their own fabje~ts, and foxnetimes in foreign
countries. But as the feudal policy provided no
f~uffcienzt fund for such extraordinary service , these
adventurers were dif'miffed at the clos~e of eve-
ry campaign, or upon any profiped of acco-
modation; and having been little accustomed

A Body of trobps k~eptr constantly on foot,

thd re~egular-ly trained to military ifxbordination.,
Ccould have f'uppliled what wais wanting in the
feudal confita~tilon, and have fursnif~hed princes
wtith the mea~ns of executing; enterprizes to
which they were then unequal. Such an eflablifh-
rnebnt, however;, wvas to repugnant: to the ge;
trius of feudal: poticy and to incompatible with

heprivileges and, pretenf~los o6f the nobility,

that: during sev~eral centuries no monarch was
either so bold, orr so polwerful, as to venlture on
any flep towards introducing· it. At last, Charles
'VII. availin~g hitnf~elf of the repuitatio~n which
he had acquired by his ~fucceff'es ag~ainst theEng-
lith, and taking advantage of' th~eimpreffrons of
terror which fazch as formidable enemy had left
upon the minds of his fubje~ts, execut~ed that:
which his predecessors durff not attempt. (A. D.
1445.) UCnder pretence of keepingT alway~3s on foot

any fedden invafxon of the Engifh~, he, a~e
tiinewhen he disbanded his other troops et n--
ed under arms a body of nine thou jand' IrEry ,
and offixtreen thousand infantry. He appropriated,
funds for the regular paymenit of these; he flati-
oned thern in different places of the kingdomr
secocrding to his pleas~ure; and appoint~ed t8he: of-

ficers wvho crommand~ed and dis~cip~lined, that. The
prime nobility courted his- service, in which they
were thaught to depend on their sovereign,
to exeidath his or~ders, and to lookr tip to him
as· the judge and rewarder of thteir merit. The
feudal mnilitia, compos~ed of the, vailals whom
the nobles could call out to follpw their ftaix-
dard, as it was in no, egree, comparable to a
body of soldiers regularly trained to war, funk
gradually in ·reputation. The strength of armies
c~ame to be eftimate<Fonly by the number of dif-
ciplined men which they contained. In less than
a century, the nobles and their military tenants,
though fomnetimes summoned to the field, a~c
cording to ancient form, were copfidered as an
incumbrance upon the troops with which they
a6ted; and were viewed with contempt by fol-
diers accustomed to the vigorous and fleady ope.
rations of regular service.

4 The effe~ts of thiit

Thus the regulations of Charles thbSS-a

-vrenth, by eftablit~hing the sirs t sanding~ army
known in Europe, occafloned an important re-
:tolution. in its affairs' and policy. By depriv-
ing the nobles of that direEtion of the nation-
al militaryt force of the Rtate, wh~ich had raif-
ed t~hem to~ fach high· authority an~d importanl
ce, a deep wound was given to the feudal
ariff~ocracy, in that part where its power seem-
ed to be most complete.

France, by fo~rmring this body of regular·

troops, at a time wheri th~ere was hardly , ae
squadron or camnpany kept in ~oilitant pay in·
any other part ,of Europe,- acquired fisch· ad-
vintages· over its neighbours,9 eitheis in attack
or defence., .thiat~ elf - pres~ervation made it nle-
cefirry for them to imitate its example. ] Mer-
cenary troops wdre introduced into all the
cohfiderable kingdomsi on the continent. They
gradually became the only military fbrce that
wyas employed or trusted. It has long beena
the chiefebje&t of po~iey to increase andE to
firpport, them., It has long b~een the great aim-
off princes anid ministers to dife~redit and to an-
nihilate all other means of 2adtona.1 adtivit~y or
defence.

The Monarchs 6f F~rarice encou~ragedi to extend thieir prerogai

tive.

As the Kings of France got the sta~rt of

other powers in establis~hing a military force in
their dominions, which enabled them to carry
on foreig~n operations with more vig~our, and
to greater extent, to they were thefirit who
effe~tually bro'ke the feudal aristocracy, and-
humbled the great vassals of the crown, who
by their exorbitant power had long circumferib-
ed the royal prerogative within very narrow
limitsj and had rendered all the -efforts of the
m3onarchs of Europe inconsiderable. Many
things concurred to undermine, gradually, the

poker of the feudat aristocracy in France. The
wealt~h and. pro~pertty·of the nobility were great-
ly impaired during the long wars pvhich the
kingdom wass obliged to maintain with the
English. TJhe exutraordinary zeal with which
they exerted themselves in defence of their
country againit its ancient enem~es, exhauffed
thke fortunes .of f'ome great families. - As atl-
most every province in the kingdom was, in
its turn, the feat of war, thne lands of others
were exposed- to the depredations of the ene-
my, were ravaged by the mercenty troops
which their sovereigns hired~ occatfionallyT, but:
could not pay, or were des~olated wvith rage
still more deftraftive by th~e peasants, in their
different infurre~tions. 'At the fame tire, the
necessities of government- having forced their
kings upon the desperate expedient of making
great and sudden alterations inl the current coin
of tlhe kingdomr, the fines, -quit -rents, and
i6ther payments fixed by ancient cuffom, funkr
much,in value, and the revenues of a fief ·were
reduced far below the fam rwhirch it hadt
once yielded. During their· contests with the
English, in which a generous- niobility courted
every station where danger appeared, or honour
could be gained, many f~amilies of note became
extinit, and their fiefs were r~eunited to the
crown. Othier fiefs , in a long· course of
years, fell to female heirs, and, were divided

His ~meafares for humbling the nobility.

The maxims. of his adminiffration were as

profound as they were fatal to the privileges of
the nobility. - Re fille<L all the departments of
government with new men , and often with
persons whom he called from the lowitef as iAvell
as most d~efpife'd funaions~in life, and rai~ed at
.pleasure to sta-tions of great power or tratft.
These were his only cdnfidents, whom hie con-
fEulted in forming his plaixs, ,and to whom hej
committed thre execut~ion of them: WThile -the:
nobles,9 accuftomned to be .the contipanioils, the

were treated with such fludiaS and mortifying

ed to retire to their cattles, where. they rei
mained unemploye~d and forgotten. Not fatis-
~fled with having rendered the nobles of less
confideraition, by taking out of their hahds the
sole dire~tion of affairs, Louis added insult to

privileges,· endeavoured to degrade the order,

Nor was it the power alone or wealth of:

he seized with a fkropg hand Burgundy and Ar-·

But fatal as his :admriniffration was to Ith~e

liberties of his fabje~ts, the authority . hich
he acquired, the resources of which he became
tnafer, and his free'dom from reffraint in con-
certing his plans as well as in executing them,
rendered his reign adive and enterprizing. Louis
negociated in all the courts of Europe; he ob-
served the motions of all his neighbours; he en-·
gaged, either as prificipal, or as an auxiliary,
in every great tranfkc~ion; his rd-loluti'ons were~
prompt; his operations vigorous; and upon every
emerg~ence he could call forth into aftion the
whole force of his kingdom. From the aera of
~his reign, the kings of France, no longer flet-
tered and circumscribed at home by a jealous
nobility, have exerted thems~elves more abroad,
'have formed more extenfr-ve schemes of foreign·
conquests, and have carried on war with a fp~3i-
rit and vigour long unknown in Europe.

Steps taken towards extending the power of the crown in

England.

The example which Louis s~et was too in-

viting naot to be imitated by other princes. Henry
V3II. as fbon as he was s~eated on.the throne of
England, formed the plan of enlarging his own
prerog~ative, by breaking the power of the no-
bility. The circumffances under which he un-
dertook to execute it, were less favourable than

those which induced Charles VII. to mak~e the
fa~me attempt; and the spirit with which he
condulted it, was very different from that of
Louis XL. Charles, by the fuxccefs of his arms
algain~it the Englith, by the mn'erit of having exv-
pelled, them out of to many' provinces, had efta-
blitihed himf'elf so firmly in the confidence of
his people, as encouraged him to make bold
eneroa~chments on the tancient confitiution. Thbe.
.daring· genius of Louis broke through every bar-
rier, and endeavoured to overturn or to remove
every obfacle that flood in his way. But Henry
held the feeptre by a disputed title; a popular
fa~tion was rea~dy every moment to take armTs
against him; and. aft~er lohg civil wars, duringr
which the nobility had often displayed their po-
wer in creating and deposing kings, he felt that
the regal authority had been so much relaxed,
and that he entered into p~offeiion of a prerow
grative to much abridged, as made it neceffaryi
to carry on his meafurres deliberately, and with-
out any violent exertion. H-e endeavoured tao
undermine that formidable fitrdture, which he
duriE not attack with open force. His schemes,
though cautious and f~lowr in their operation ,
were well concerted, and produftive in the end
of great efFefts. By his laws, permitting the
barons to break the entails of their eflates, and
to -ex pose them to sale; by his re-gulations to
prevent the nobility from keeping in their ~e~r.
vice thof'e numerous bands of retainers, wohicy~

rendered th~em formnidable, and: turbulent; by
encouraging population, ~agricullture, and comi
nierce; by fecuiring to his' fixbjert~s., during a
long reign, the enjoymnent of the blefi~ngs whidi
flow from the arts :of peace~; by accustoming:
. hema to an adm~inikration' of govlenrnmebt, unn

der which the laws were~ execitted with iteadi-
92efs ahd .vigour; he mnade imperceptibly fixch
alterations in :the English conititution, that he
tratnifusitted to his faicceffor authority to exten-
five, as rendered hink ohe of the moeft abf~olutd
monazrchs in Europe, and captable of the greatest:
and most~ vigoro~us efforts.

Wihich were very e tensive, with extraordinary
vigour an'd effed.~

Events happened , which called the several monarchs to; exert

= th~e new powers whid-h they haid ac~quired.

While these princes were thus enlarging

the boirndaries of prerogative, and tak~ing ;fach
fieps towards rendering their kingdoms capable
of a~ting with union and with force, events oc-
curred, which called them forth to exert th~eir
new powers which they had acquired. .These
eng~aged thiem in such a series As enterprizes and
32eg~ociations , that the affairs of all the c~on-

'/ fiiderable nations -in Europe came to be in-

sensibly~ interwoven with. each other ; and a
great political fyfitem was gradually formed ,
which grew to be an objeat of universal~8 attention.

The first of there events was the marriage of the heirets

of the hoow~e of Burgund~y.

Tdhe fir~st: event w~hich merits notic~e, on

account of its influence in producing this change
in the slate ofEurope, was the marriage of the
daughter. of Charles the Bold, the fble' heiress
of the house of Burgundy. For fbtame years be-

f~-ore her fathler s deut~h, tihe h~ad beent confideredl
as the apparentl ihereffo to hi's territories, and
C~harles had made · p~rpopefas of marrying; her to

them, by thbt offEeti tb favrour! the! ·feem~es which
·his r~eftle's asmbition was corqtintrally· formIing.

The import~ance of this to the ita.te of E~urope.

rh~is rendered the alliance with her· an ob.

je& of general attenztion; and all the advantages
of acquiring po~ef'ieon of her territories, the
mos% opulent at that time, and b-es cultivated
of any on this fide of the A~lps, were perfeal~y
'underfl~ood. . As soon, then, as the untimely
death of Chazrles (A. D. r477. January 5.) opened
the facceiron, the eyes of all the princes in Exi-
rope were, turned towards M~ary, and they felt:
thetmfelves deeply interefied In the choice which
the was about to- maike of the person on whorn
thae would bestow that rich inheri~tance.

Louis XI. from whole ksingdom ~several of

~th pr~ovinces· which fl~ie poffellhd had been dif~i-
membered , a~nd whofet domrinions stretched
along the frontier of her territories, had every
inducement to court her alliance. He had ,like-.

reception of any-reafonable proposition he t~hould
make, with refped to the difpsofal of a prin-
cess, w-ho wa~s the vailkl of his crown, and

T~he next considerable event wvas the inv~allon of Italy by

Charles V1II. A. D. 1494.

The next event of consequence in the ~sis-

Leenth century , was the expediti~on of Charles
VI~II. into Itsaly. Thi~s occalen~e~d r~evolutions
nol less m~emorable; produced alttera~tions, which~
were more immediately perceived, both in the
mlili~tary and political lyffiem; touz~ed the ftates'
pofEurope to bolder efforts; and blended their'
affairs and interets more closely -together.,

Thbe

Thbe motives of~ this.

The mild adminiitration of Charles, a weak:

but generous Prince, s~eems to hlave revide~d thP
fipirit and g~enius of the French nation, which the
Iligid delpotiftn of Louis XI. his father, had Ege-
rpreffed, and alnoft extinguaifted. The ardour
for mnilitary- fe~rice, natural to the French no-
bility, returned, and their young monarch was
impatient. to dimigitihgaf his reign by some fplen-
A~id enterprikA~i WUhile he wats unlcertain towards
whabt quarter he thould turn his arms, the soli-,
eitstions and. intrigues of an Italian politician,
no· less infamous on account of his ~crimes, than
eminent for his abilities, determined his choice.
L~udoivico Sf~orza, having· formed the d~esign of
.depoling· his nephew the duke of 1Hilan, and of
ph~icing hirdblf on the dukal throne , was to
munch afraid of a combination of the Italian po-
wrers to thwart this nreafare, and to s~upport
the injured Prince, withi whom most of them
~were conne~ted by blood or alliance , that he.
fawr the neceffty of fecurin g the aid of some
a~ble prote~tor. The King of France was the
person to whom he ap~plied; and Whoutout dife
closing to h~im his own intentions, he laboured
to prevail with him to march into Italy, at the
head of a powerful army , in order to feizeth~e
crown of Naples, to whifch he had pretenflone
as heir of the house of Anjon:. The right to
that king~domn, claimed by the Ang~evin family,
:had b~een conveyed to Louis XJ. by Charles of'

Hlia, of Charl, V, Vol. II T

knjoru, count of lMaine and Provence. But: that
sagacious monarch , though he took immediate
poflfefiion of those territories of which Charles
·vas really, maftere, thtally disregarded his idea~l
title to a kingdom.,; over which aso~ther prince
riegned in tranquillity; and uniformly declin ec
involving himself in the labyrin~th of Italiah po-
liticks. His son, more adventurous, or more
inconsiderate, emrbarked ,eagerly in th~is enter--
prize ; and contemning all the redi~or-itrances of
his most experience'd counfiellors , Irepared ti:
carry it on with the titmoft vigour.

Hiis iriources for this enterpi'ize.

Tihe power which Charles poffeff'ed wbis rft

great, that he reckoned himself eqlual to .thit
ar~duous undertaking. His fath~er had tranfmnitl
ted to him fa~ch an aiiple prerogative, as ganve
himi the entire com~mand ·of his kingdom. He
himfeklf had added considerably to the eirtent of
hiis dominio-ns, by his prudent m~arriagre iwith
the heii~efs of 13retagne, Whi~ch rendered him
master of that province, the last of the great
fiefs that rematined to be annexed. to the cro~wn.
He soon assembled forces wvhich he thought fuzf-
sident; and to impatient was he to enter on his
career as a co~nqueroiyj that sacrificing w~hat was
real, for what was chimeticatl, he reffored Rous-
Fil.:on to Ferdin~and , and g~ave up part of his
father's acqulfitions in Artois t~o 1Maximilian,
with a view of induicing there princes not to

molest France, - while he was carrying on his
opera~tions in Italy.

Bis preparations for it.

But: to different were the efforts of the Sta-

tes of Europe ih . the fifteenth century , fromi
tho0se wvhich we thaxll behold In the co-urse of
this hiffory, that: the army with which Charles
ti~ndertook this great· enterprize, did not exceed
twventy thousand men. The train of artillery,
howvever, the ammunition , and warlike flores
of every kind prov'ded for its us~e, were s~o con-
fiderable, as to bear f'om~e refemblanee to the
imnmenfe apparatus of modern war b).

Its facc;e·s.

Wihen th~e French entered Italy , they met:

w~ith1 nothing able to resist themn. The Italian
powers having remained, during· a long; period,
undifforbed by the invallon of any foreign ene-
iny, had forme~d a fyfitem with refpeift to their
affairs , both in peace and war , peculiar to
thems~elves. Inz order to adjust the interests,
an d balance thle pow er of thle different slates
into whichItaly was divided, they were engag-
ed in perpetual, and endless negociations with
each other, which they conduc'ted with all the
s~ubtlety of a refining and deceitful policy. Their
contests in the field, when they had recourse

to: arms,' were d~ecided in mock battles, byi in-
32ocent and bloodless viaories. Upon th~ Airit:
appearance of the danger which now impended,
they .had recorir'e to the arts which they had
Altied, and employred their utmolit fiill in in-
trigue in order to avert it. But: this proving
Ineffe~tual , their eff~eminate mercenaries , the
only military force that remained in the country',
being~ fit only for the parade of service, wcere
terrified at the aigedt of real: war, and' thJ~run~k
at its approach. The impetuosity of the French
valour appeared to them. irresist~ible. Flo~rence,
Pisa, and Reme opened their gates as the Fre~nch
army advanrced. The profpye& of this :dreazdfill
invaflon firack one King of Naples with fachl
panic terror, that he died (if we may believe
hiiftrians) of the' frig-ht. Another atbd~icated.
his throne from the fa~me pusillanimous Epirit.
A third fled out of his dominions, as soon as
thie enetry appeared on the NMeapolitan frontiers.
Charles, after marching thither faom the bottom
of; the Alps, with as much rapidity, and almost
as little opposition, as if he had been on a pro-
grefs through his own dominions , toosk quiet
poffefr~on of the throne of Naples, and intimi-
.dated or gave law to every power ii12 Italy. .
Its effeas,· pa~rticularly in giving rife to the6 tyihet concerning

a balance of power.

Such was the concluflon of this expedition,

wyhich mult. be confiidered as the first great ex-

ertion· of ghofe new powers which the princes
of Europe ;had acquired, and now began to eX-
erc~ife. Its effe~ts wrere no les~s considerable ,
than its faccefs had be~en astonishing. The Ita-
lians, u~nable to refiift the imprefiion of the ene-
my which 'broke .in upon them, permitted him
to hold on his cours~e undilutrbed. They quickly
perceive-d that no fingfle power , which they
conild routie to aI~on, was an equsal mnatch for
a monarch, Who ruled over such exstenfive teri
ritori~es, and was at the head of s~uch a martital
people; but that- a confederacy mig~ht accomplis~h
what the flepara~te membters~ of it du~rst not atj
tempt. To 'this'expedient, the only one that
remraine~d to daeliver or to preserve them from
the yoke, they had recourf~ie. While Charles
inconsiderately wasted his time at Naples in fef-
tivatls and triumphs on accounrt of his past fuxc-
~eefes, or was fondly dreaming of future c~on-
quests in the East, to the empire of which he
now alpired, they formed against him a p~ower-
ful combination of almost all the Italian slates,
supported by the Emperor M/aximilian, and Ser-
dinand King of Aragon. Th~e union of so many
powers, who furpended or forgot all their par-
ticular animofities , th~at they might aC~t w'~ith
co~cert againf an enemy who had become for-
mid able .to them all , awaken ed Charles from
his thoughitlefs security. He saw now no pro-.
fpe~t of tfafty but in returning to France. An
army of thirty thousand men , assembled by the

allies , was ready to obfkru~t: his mrch; an d
though the French , with a. daring courage ,
wvhich more than conuterb~alanced their inferiu-
rity in number, broke through that great body,
and gained a vi~tory , which opened to their
monafch a safe passage into his own territories,
he was firipped of all his conquests in,Italy in
si t~ho~rt a time as it had taken to acquire them;
and the political system in that country refaumed
the fame appearance as before his invaiion.

This becomes the g-reat obje&f of policy, first in Italy , nand

then in Europe.

The fiudden and decfifve effe&t oft this cott-

federacy, seems to have inftraded. the princes
and ftatelrmen of' Italy as much as the irruption
of the French; had difcorncerted_ and alarmed
them. They had extended , on this occallon
to the affairs of Europe, the maxims of that
political fecience which had hitherto been appli-
ed only to regulate the operations of the petty
states in their own country. They had disco-
vered the method of preventing any monarch
from risin~g to s~uch a degree of powyer, as was
inconsistent with the general liberty; and had
manifefie'd the importance of attendipg to that
great secret in modern policyT, the prefervatien
of a proper distribution of power among all the
members of the ijyfiem into which the slates
of Europe are formed. During all the wars of
which Italy from that time was the theatre,

-and amid the hostile operations which te im-
Iprudenchof Louis XHI. and the ambition of
F~erdinand ofT Aragon, parried o~n in thart coun-
try, wvith little int~erruption, from thle close of
the 'fifi-teenth cePtury , to that period at which
the ~subseq-u~ent history commences, the' main-
tainipg a proper baanlc~e of power. betwveen the
contending parties, became the great objec2 of
attention to the fitteficen of Italy. N~or was
the idea confined to them. Self-prefervation
taughlt other powers to adopt it. It grew to
be ~fahionable and univerfCal. From this iera
we can trace th'e progres~s of that Intercourse
between nations, which had lipked the po-
vgers of E~urope ito closely together; and _can
discern the operations of that provident policy,
which, during peace, guards against remote
and contingent dangers; which, ifi war, hath
pievenlted rapid and deifru~tive conquests.

The wars in Italy render standing armies gen-eral.

T~his wa~s not the onlyi effe& of the opera-

tions wvhich the great powers of Europe car-
ried on in Italy. T~hey contributed to render
general faxch a change, as the F~ren-ch had be-
gu~zn to mtlke in the ftte of their troops; and
obllige~d all the princes , who appeaqred on this
new theatre of a~ion, to efitablifh the military
frce of t~heir kingdoms on the A~me footing;
drith that of Franc~e. When the feat of war
camve to be remote`S from the countries which

dal vailfals ceafkd to -be of any afe) a ther ne-
be~ffty of employing troops, regularly trained to
arms., and kept ·in c~o~nfant- payi, came at once
to be evident. Wiherl Charles ' miarched i~nt~o
Italy, his catralry was chtirely compos~ed of
those companies of Gendarmes, emb~odie~d by
Charles VII. attd continued by Louis XI.; his-
infantry· consisted partly of Swiss, hired of the
Cantons, · and partly of Gafoons, armed and
disci-plined after the Swif's model. To the~e:
Louis XII. added a body of Germans, well
known in- the wars of Italy by the name of the
Black~ Bands. B~ut. neither of the~ re onarchs
made any account of the feldabl militia, or ever
h ad recourse to that' military force which they
might~ have corrmanded, in virtue of the an-~
clent in~itittions in their kingdomn. ~Maximilian
and Ferdina'nd, as -fbon as they began to aB in
Italy, emnployed the fame ihfftrutnents, and
trusted the exiecution of their plans entirely to
m~ercenary troops.

Teach Europeans the superior importance of infanrtry in: war.

This innovation in the military ijyftem was

quickrly followed by another, which the cuf-
tom 'of employing ·Swiss in the Italian wars
was the occasion of introducing. The arms
-and disc6ipline of the Swiss were different ~from
those of other European nations. During~ their
long and violent f~truggrles in defence of their

libertiesginft the house of Aufftria', whose
armies , ke those of· other considerable prin-
ces, codifi~ed chiefly of heavy-armed cavalry,
the Swis~s found tha~t their po~verty, ancd the:
fmnall numnber of gentlemnen residin~g in their
.country, at thiat time barren and ill -cultivated,
put it out of their power to bring into the field
any body of horse capable of facing the enemy,
Neceility compelled them to place all their con-
fidence in infantry; and in order to render it
capable of withffanding the thiockk of cavah-y,
they gave the sol~diers breaft~-plates and helmets
as defensive armour; t~ogether with long spears,
h~alberts, and heavy fwvords,? as weapons of of;
fence. They formed them into large battalions,
ranged in deep and close array, to that they
could present on every; fide a formidable front
to the enemy c). The mpen at arms could make
no impreffon on the s~olid firength of fach'
a body. It repulsed the Auffrians in all their
attempts to conquer Swiffe~rland. It broke the
Burgundian Gendarmerie, which was fecarcelyT
inferior to that of ~France, either in number or
reputation; and when first called t-i~a& in Ita-
ly, it bore down, by its irresistible force, eve-
ry enemy that attempted to oppose it. There
repeated proofs of the decisive effedt of infan-
try, exhibited on fulch confpicuours occasions,
restored that s~ervice to reputatioen, and · grady-*

ally re-established the opinionl, w~hich al~!d beenl
long exploded , of its superior simportance in the
operations of- war. But the glory which the
Swiss had acquire-d, hav'ing inspired them with
funch high ideas of teir owix prowers and con-
sequence as frequently rentdered them mutinous
and insolent, the princes who employe~d them
became weary of depending on the caprice of
foreign mercenaries, and began to turn their
attention towards the improvement of their na-
tional infantry.

N7ational infantry estab~lish~ed in Germany.

The German powers having the~ c~omnanid

of mep, whom ;nature has endowed with that
iteady courage and persevering firength which
forms th~em to be sold~iers, s~oon modelled th~eir
troops in farch a manner,. that they viedt with
the Swiss both in dis~cipline and valour.

In'f. France.

The French monarches, though more slowly,

and with greater di~fficulty, accuffomed the im-
petuous ifpirit of their people to su~bordination
and discipline; and were at fach pains toj reader
their national infaintry refpe~table, that as early
as the reign of Louis XII. s~everal 'gentlemen of
high rank had to far abandoned their ancient
ideas, as ·to con'def~cent~ to ente~r into that fCer-

In Spain.

The Spaniards, whos~e situation made it dif-

ficult to employ any other than their national
troops in the foutherni parts of Italy, which
was the chief fecene of their operat~ions in that
country, not only adopted the Swiss discipline,
but improved ·upon it, by mingling a propter
number of s~oldiers, armed with heavy muikets,
in their battalions; and thus formed that famous
body of inifantry, w~hich, during a century and
a half, was the admiration and terror of all
Europe. The Italian itates gradually diminish~ed
the number of their cazval~ry, and, in imitation
of their more powerful neighbours, brought the
firength; of their armies to consist in foot f~ol-
diers. From thiis period the nations of Europe!
have carried on war with forces more adapted
to every species of ferfvice, more capable of
a~ting in ever~y country, and better fitted both
for makringr conquests, and for preserving them.

The Itatlian wars occasion an increate of the public revenues

in Europe.

As their effort in Italy led the people of

Europ'e to there improvements in the art ofwar,
they gave them likewis~e the first idea of the
expence which accompanies great and, continued
operations, an~d accuffa~med them to the burden
of those impositions which are necessary for sup-
porting them. · While ·the feudal policy fablidled
in full vigour, while armies were composed of

military vassals called, forth to attakr fbme neigh-
bouring power, and to perform, in a thoart cam-
paign, the feervices wohich they owed to their
fov'reeign, the7 expence of 3war was extremely
moderate. A finall furbidy enabled, a prince to
heg~in andt to fixijfh hiis greateit operations. But.
wrhen Italy Became the theatre on wvhich the
powers of Europe contended for furperiority, the
pireparatiofis reqniftte for futchi a difkant expedaic
tion, the pay of~ armies kept conitantly on foot,
their fabift~ence in a foreign country , the fie-·
ges to be undertaken, an~d the towns to be de-
fended, twvelled the charg~es of war immensely,
and, .by creating demnands unknown in les~s a~ive
times, multiplied taxes in every kingdom. Thel
progress of ambition, however, was to rapid,
and princes extended their operations toa fast ,
that it was improilible at; first to establis~h funds
proportional to the increase of expence which
ther~e occasioned. t6hen Charles VIEII. invad'ed.
Naples, the furns requisite for carying on that
enterprize to far exceeded thos~e which France
had been accustomed ~to contribute, that before
hie reached the frontiers of Italy, his tre~asury
wias :exhanited, and the domeffic resources, of
which his extenflive prerog'ative gave 'him the
coimmand, were a~t an end. As~ he durfkt not
venture to lay any new imposition on his people,
oppress~ed already with the weiight of unusual
burdens; the only expedient that remained was,
to borrow of the Genoese as much money as

-msight enable him to continue his marrch. But
he coult not: obtain a fu~fficient faum, without
eontenting to pay annuallly the exorbitant in-
-teres~t of forty-two livres for every hundred that
he received e). WIe may observe the fame
disproportion between t-he efforrts and reven~ues
of othier princes, his contemporaries. From
this period, taxes went on in creating; and during
the reign of Char~les V. s~uch fumns were levied
in every flaste, as would have appeared prodi-
gious at the clare of the fifteenth century, and
gradually prepared the Iway for the more exuor-
Bitant exa~ions of modern times.

The l'eague of Cambray another important occurrnc~e.

The last tranfa~ion, previous to the r~eign

of ,Charle~s V. that merits attention on account
of its influence upon the itate of Europe, is the
league of Cambray. To humble the republick of
Venice, and to divide its territories, was the
objeit of all the powers who united in this con-
federacy. The chtril confitattion of Venice
efitablith~ed on a firm blaiis, had fuffered no con~.
fiderable alteration for several centuries ; dur-
.ing which, the senate condnaed its affairs,
by maxims of policy no less prudent than vi-
goro~us, and a~dhered to ther'e with an Uniform
consistent spirit, which gave that commonwealth
great advantage over other slates, whose views
iand maeafures changed, ps often as thet form of

their government, or the pers~ons wh~o adminif-
tered it. By thef'e unintermitted ex~ertions of
wvifdom and vazlour, the Venetians enlarged th~e
dominions of their commonwealth, until it be-
came the most confiderazble power in Italy.
W7hile their exutenfive commer~ce , the us~eful
and cuzriouS ma~nufadtures which they carried
on, tog~ether with their monopoly of the pre-
cious commodities of the East, rendere~d Ve-
nice the most opulen~t: state in ]Europe.

The motives of it.

Their powrer was the obje~t of terror to

their Italian neighbours. Their wealth was
viewed with envy by the greatest monarchs,
who couild not vie wtith their private citizens
in the magnifi~cence of their buildings, in the
richnefis of their dress and furniture, or in
[plendor and elegance of livin g. f). Julius II.
whose ambition was su~perior, and his abilities
equal, to those of anly Pontiff who ever fat
on the papal throne, formed the idea of this
league against the Venetians, and endeavoured,
by applying to there pa~ffons which I have
mentioned, to perfa~ade other princes to join
in it. By working upon the fears of the Ita-

. lian powrers, and upon the avarice ·of the mo-

narchs beyond the Alps, he induced them, in
concurrence with other causes, which it is not
mny province to exphl~dn, to form one of the

Inoft extensive confed eracies against those h a ght-y
republicans, that Europe h~ad ever beheld.

The rapid progress of the conrfederates.,

The emperor, the king of Aragon, th~e

pope, were prin~cipals in the leag~ue of Calme
bray, to wthich almost all the prinlces of Italy
acceded, the least considerable of themn hoping
for some share in the spoils of a state, wh~ich
they already deemed to be devoted to deflruc-
tion. The Venetians might have diverted this
fterm, or have broken its force ; but with a
prefixmptuous rafhlnef~s, to which there is no-
thing similar in th~e cours~e of thleir hiffory;, they
waited its approach. The impetuous valour
of the French rendered ineffe~tual all their pre-
cautions for the safety of the republick; and
the fatal battle of Ghiarradda entirely ruined
the army, on which they relied fbr defenei.
Jillius seize~d all the towns which they held in
the ecclefiafficali territories. Ferdinand rean-
nexed the towns of which they had got poffer'
sion on the coaff of Calabria, to his Neapoli,
tan dominions. IMaximilian, at the head of a
powerfuxl army, advanced towards Venice on
th~e one fide. The F~rench puf'hed their con-
quests on the other. The Venetians, fuzrround-
ed by so many enemies, and left without one
ally, funk~ from the heig~ht of presumption to

who had lately accended thle throne of Eng-
1iand, to favour their operations byi invading-
France. Louis XII. resifted all the efforts of
this formiidable and uqeexpet~ed confederacy with
undaunted fortituide. Hofts~ilit~ies w~ere carried

wYhich a~ted any confiderazble part during that

It is lo les~s necelffhry to becom~e acquaintl

operatrions. But, writhout at djitinn knowledge
of the pecurliar form and genius of th~eir civil goT
ve rnment, a great part of their trtanfa~tions matt

appear altogether my~erious and inexplicable..

ing th~e condu&~ of nations.

A minute detail, however, of the pecu-

liar forms and regulations: in every country,
would lead to dedalt~ions of immeafarable length.
To fkretch out the great l]ines which diflinguifh
and charadierif~e each goviernment, is all that
the nature of if y present workr will admit of ,
and all that is necessary to ilalufrate the events
wvhich it· records.

The slate of Italy.

At the openings of the sixt~eenth~ centul-

ty , the political face of Italy- was extre-

mely different hror that of any other part of
Europe. Initead of those extensive monarchies,
which occupied the reft of the continent, that
delightful country was parcelled out among ma-
ny fnall st~ates, each of which poff'efed fove-
reign and independ~ent jurisdi~tion. The only
monarchy in Italy was that of Naples, The
dominion of the popes was of a peculiar species,
to which there is nothing similar either in an-
'clent or mnodern t~imes. In Venice and Floren--
ce, a republican form of governm~ent was ef~a-
blithed. 1Hiilan was fiabje&t to fovereings, who
had assumed no higher title than that of dukres.

The papal digniey the highest in Europe.

The Pope was the first of there powers in

dignity, and not the least confijderable by the
extent of his territories. In the primitive church,
the jurisdiction of bifhlops was equal· and co-
ordinate. The derived, perhaps, fomet degree
of consideration from the dignity of the fee in
which they presided. They poffeff`ed, howe-
ver, no real authority or pre-eminence, bu~t
wihat they acqluired by s~uperior abilities, or fu-
perior fanatity.

Origfin and ptrogreTs of the papal powetr.

As Rome had to Jong been the sea of em-

pire, and capital of the world , its bishops were
on that accounlt entitled to refp~eat;, they re-
iteivedl it; but dusring feverazl ages thiey cliaim~-

ed and received nlothing more. Fromjn there
humble beg-inninmgs, they advanced with fach
an! adventurous and well-dir~e~ed ambitrion, that
.thre~y eftablifhled a s~piritu~al dominion over the
m~inds and sentiments of men, to which atllEu-
rtope farbmitted with implicit: olmdience. Thbeir
claimn of universal jurifdic~ion, as he~ads of the
church; and their pretenflons , to infallibilitll
in their deciflons., as facceffors of St. Peter ,
.are .as chimerical, as9 th~ey are repugnant to.
·the g-enius of the Chnriftian religion. B3ut on
there~ foundations, th~e fuxperfitidon and c~redu~i-
ty of mankind enabled them to ere~t an amaz-
ing; fuperftru~ture. In all eccl~esiastical2 cont~ro-
verfies, their decisions were r~eceived as the in-
fallible oracles of truthi. N or was the; plenituy
de of their, power confined to therfe alone; they
dethroned monarchs; dispos~ed of crowns; ab-
solved fub~jefts from the obedience due to th~eir
fovereings·; and laid kringdoms under interdi~ts.
There was not a slate in Europe which ha~d not
been difguieted by their ambitioq. There ws snot
a throne which they 'had. not thaken; nor a
prince, who ·did not tremble at their power.
The territories of the po~pes inadequate to support. their spiritual

jurisdi~tion.

Nothing was watnting to render this empir'e

abfblute, and to e~tablifb~ it ona the ruins of a.11
~civil authorityl, but that the popes thould have
poffeffed fazch a d~egree of temporal power, as
wy~as futfficient to fiecon4 and enforc~e their fpiri-

etual decrees. H~appily for mankind, wvhile their
[Epiritual jurisdi~tion was most extensive, and
at its grea~test height, their temporal property
was extremnely limited. They wvere BowerfuljB
pontiffs, formidable at a dift'ance; but they
;wer-e petty princes, wvithout any considerable
domneffic force. 'They had earlly et deavoured,
indeed , to aIcquire territory by arts, simular to
those which they had employed in extend-
ing their jurifdi~tion. Under pretence of a
donation from~ Conla~ntine, and of another from
ChaLrlemagne or his fa~ther Pepin, they atetemp&t
ped to take poffre~ion of fomne towns adjacent to
Rome. But there donati~ons were fli~tioncs,
and availed thetr l.ittle. T~he benefaitions, for
which they were indebted to the credulity of
the N~orman adventurers, wIho conquered Na-
ples, and to the fuperRition of the counters
Matilda, were real, and added am~ple domrains
to the Holy Seel

Their authority in their own territories extremely limited.

But the power of the popes did not in-

crea~se in proportion to th~e extent of territory
which they had acquired. In the dominilons
annexed to the Holy See , as well as in thof'e
fabjeEt to other princes in Italy, the sovereign
of a, state was far from having the comnmand of
the force wh~ich it contained. During the tu~r-
bulence and confusion of the middle ages ,
the powerful nobility, or leaders of popular

.fai~ions in Italy, had f'eized the government of
different towns; and after fitreng~thening their
;fortifications, arid taking a body of mercenaries
into. pay, they -aspired at independence. The
territory which the church had gained was fil-
led with petty tyrants of this k~ind, who left
the Pope hardly the Shadow of dominion.,

It was circumscribed by ;he ambition of the R~oman, barons,

As there uf~urpat-ions almost annihilated the

papal power in the greater part of the towns
fabjeat to the church , the Roman barons fre-
quently disp~uted the authority of the po-
pes, even in Rome itfel4 Inz t~he twelfth cen-
tury , an opinion began to be· propagated.
-,,That as the fundlion of e~cclefiaftics was puzre-
ly. spiritual, they ought to poff'ers no property,
and to claim no temporal jurifdlaion; but, ac-
cording~ to th-e laudable example of their prer
deceffrors in the primitive church , t~hould
faubiift wholly upon their ti~thes, or upon the
voluntary oblations of the people. a) " This
do~rine being addre~ssed to men , who had be-
held the fcandalours manner in whiich the
avarice and ambition of the clergy had promnpt-
ed them to contend for wkealth, and to exrer-
cife power, they liktened to it with fond at-
tentioni. Thie Roman barors , who had felt
most sensibly the rigour of ecclesiastical op-
preflion, adopted there sentiments with such ardour

'that they f'et themselves inflantly to ihakre off the
yoke. (A.1 D. x 343,) They endeavoured to restore
some image of their ancient liberty, by reviving
the inftituction of the Roman; f~enazte, in which
they vefied supreme authority; committing the
executive power fomnetimes to one chief senator,
fome~timens to tw~o, and, fom~etimeos to a magri-
ftrate dignified with thle name.0s the Patrician.
The popes exerted themnfelves with vigour, in

the people. During s~eventy ye~ars of the four-

teenth cen~turyv, the popes fixed their· reflden7ce
in Avigno~n. The inhabitants of Rome, accuf-
tomed to confider th~emselves ats the descendants
of the people who had conquered the world ,
and had~ given laws to it, were too high - spirit-
ed to fixbmit with patience to the delegated au-
thority of those persons to whom the popes com--
mitterd the government of the city. " On many
occafionts, they opp~osed the execution of thfe
papal mandates, and on the fig-hteft appearance
of ininovation or oppreffxon, they were ready to
tfake a~rms in de~fence of their owcn immunit~ies.

beings initigated by Nicolas Rienzo, a man of
lowr birth and a fCeditiou~s spirit , but of p~opular

this new fyritemn; thoug~h the g~overnment of
Romre was reintat~ed iti' its ancient 1form~; yet
everyi fresh1 attackr contributed to weaken the
papal jurifdi~tion : and the turbulence of the
people concurred with the spirit o~independence
among the nobility , to circumfbribe it within
very narrow bounds. c) Gregory VII. and

great thi~ngs wrhich render-ed them so formlidable
to thie empeitors with whom they contended-,
not by the force of their arms, or by the~ ex-
tent of their power, but by the dread of their
[piritual cent~ure~s,. and by the eff~e~t of their in-
trigues, which excited rivals, and called forth
enemies againit every prince whom they wviih-
ed to depres~s or to d~estroy.

A~lexander VI. and Julius II. rendkr the p-opes considerable hrincs.

M~any attempts 'were made by the popes,

not only to humnble those ufurrpers, w ho 10rd~ed
it'over the cities in the~ eccle~fiftical iRate, but
to break the turrbulient spirit of the R.omaJn
people. Ther~e were lo~g· unfuccef~sfull. At last
Alexander VI, with a policy imo less artfuI thann
flagitions, fubdoted and extirpated most of ther
great. Roman barons, and rendered thle popes
mas~ters of their own dominions.. The enter-
prizing ambition of Julius II. added conq~ueffs
of no iticonfiderable value to the patrimony of
St. Peter. Thus the popes, by degrees, became
powerful tempora~l princes. ~Their territories,
in the age o~f Charles V.' wrere of greater extent
than at present; their country seems to have
been better cultivated and mlore populoxds; and
as they drew largee contribution-s from every
part. of Europe , their revenues far exceeded
thofb of the neighbouring powers, and render-

ed them capable of more faudden and vigorousr
e Ko rt s.

Defeas in th~e nature of ecclefialkical domninion.

The genius of the pap~al government, how-

ever, was better aIdapted to the exrercif'e offpi-
ritual dominion, than of temporal pow-er·. With
refped to the- former, all its maxims wvere ftea-
dy and invariable. Every new pontiff' adopted
the pl~an of his predeowi~or. By education and
habit, ecclefiaitics wvere t~o formed, that the
charader of t~he individual was fuank in thmat: of
the profeiaih; and the pafflions of the man w~ere-
sacrificed to thfe interest and honour of tehe
order., Th ehands wh~Tich hel~d the reins of ad-
ministration might chang~e; but the; spirit which
condu~ted themn waT;s always the fame. While
the mepafares of other· governments flutuated,
an~d 'the objets- at which they aimed varied,
the chiurch kiept one end in viewv; and to this
unrelaxing- constancy of purfait, it: was indebt-
ed for, its sUcces~s in th~e boldest: attempts ever
made by human ambition.

But in their civil adminiffration, the popes

followed no su~ch uniform or conflifent plan.
There, acs in other governments, the charaaer,
the pafilons, and the int~erests of the person
who had the thpreme dire~tionr of affairs, occa-
fioned a variation both in objeats and meafixtes.
As few prelates reached th~e famrnit of eccle-
fiaftical dignity, until they were far advanced

in life, a change of masters was more frequent
in the papal dominions than in other slates, and
the political fyfiemer was, bs colurfe, less stable
and permanent. E~very pope was eager to make
the most of the thort period, during which
he had the profpen, of enjoying power, in or-
der to aggrandize 'his own f~amily , and to. at--
·tain h~is private end~s; and it: was often the
firfE b~usiness of his faucceffer to .undo all that hle
had done, and to overturn what ~he had eft~aw
bllifhed.

As ecclefisftics were trained to pacific arts,

and early initiated in the myfieries of that po-
licy, by whichthe court,,, of Rome_ extended or
fhi~pported its spiritual dominion, the popes wecre
apt to conduaR their temporal aff~airs with the

famefpiit;and in all their meafulres were

more ready to ·employ the r-efinements of intri-
gue, than the force of arms. It: was in the
papal court that address and fulbtlety in nego-
ciation first became a science; and during~ the
fiixteenth century , Rome was considered as the
k'hool in which it migh~t be best acquir~ed.

As the decorum of their ecclesiastical cha-

ra~ter prevented the popes from placing them-
sel~ves at the head of their armies, or takring
the command, in perf'on, of the military force
inl their dominions, they were afraid to arm
their fabhjeas; and in all their operations,
wh~ether offenfive or defensive, they truffed en-
tirely to mercenary troops.

As their power and dominions could not

descend to th-~ir -poss erity 4 the p~opes were leit
solicitous than other princes to form or to en-
couarage s~chemes of public utility and ~improve-
meht. Their ten~ure was only for a Ehort life;
pres~ent adv tntage was what thley c~hiefly hiu-
died ;. to fqueede a~nd to arnzals, not to melio<
rate, was th~eir o~bje.; -They ere~ted, pers
haps, s~ome woslk of ofitentat~ion, to re~niaii tis
a nionument of their pontificate: th~ey fouand it
necefthry, at forne times, to ekablitfh' useful
infitiutions, in order to' fbothe antd silence thie
turbulent populace of Rome; but plans of ge;
neral benefit to their fabjea~si aind fratmed w-tith
a view to fitttrity, were rately ob~jeas of at;
tention in th~e pap~al policy. The paitrimnony of
St. Peter wsas w~ors~e g~overized thani any pwzirt of
Eulrope; anid though a gd~nerous .pontiff migh~t:
sus~pend for a; little, or counte'raft the eff~e~s of
those vice-s whichr are peculi~ar to thie admriniffra-
tion of cclefr-aftics; the disease not only remain-
ed incuirable, but has goane; on increasing fromn
age to age; and the decline of the slate~ has
kept pace with its progrer~s.

The popes derive fonxe advantages from the union of theii'

spiritual and tempioral autho~rity.

Oine circumffane, farther, con~cerninig the

papal government, is so fingunlar, as to merit
attention. As the s~piritual supremacy and tem-
polial power were united: its one person, and

if we confider it: as formed ~for ai numerous bo-

oppre~sses the reft.

Defeas in its government, particularly with refpedt to its mili-

tary operations.

The spirit of government, in a common-

wealth of this species, was, of course, timid
and jealous. The Venetian nobles diffrufted
their own f~ubjeas, and were afraid of allowing
them the are of arms. They encouraged among
·them the arts of induffry and. commerce; they
employed them in manufa~ures and in nav'ga-
tion; but nlever admitted them into the troops
which the slate kept: in its pay. The military
force of the republic consisted entirely~-~-- _of so-
reign mercenaries. The command of there was
never truffed to noble Venetians, left they
thouldl acquire fach influence over thep army,
as might endanger the public liberty; or becomne
accuffomed to .the exercise of fatch powvec,
as would make them unwilling; to return to the
condition of private citizens. A soldier of for-
tune was placed at the head of the armie~s of

t~he corinionwealth; and to obtaiix thzt hoixourg

or leaders of bands, who, ini the fifte~esth and

raised a~nd hired out soldiers to differefit itates.
Burt the faine futpicious policy, which idduced
them to employ there a~dventurers) preventedi
their placihg entire corifidence in them. Two
ixoblemen, appointed by thd; senate, accompa-
nie~d their army wheir it took the field , with
the a~ppellditioni of Proveditori, and, like thd
field-deputies of the D~utch re'public rin latter
times, observed all the motioris of the general,
and checked and cohtroxled him in all his ope;;

ed by the spirit of arribition, as well a$ prin-
;ces. `Whea the Vtenetiahs tCo falr forgot the inl

SEqelleffe of its paval inititutions.

It is not, how~ever, by its military,! but

by its naval and commercial power, that the
importani;pe bs the V~enetian commonwealth irruft
be efituiated. In the latter, the real force and.
likrvues of the slate consisted. The jealousy· of
government did riot extend to this department.
frothing was apprehended from this quarter ,
that could prove formidable to liberty. The
s~enate encouraged the niobles to trade, andl to
serve on board' the: fleet. They became mner.
chants and a~dmirals. They increased the wealth
of their country by their induffry. They added
to its dominions, by the valour with which theiy
condu ~ed its nalval arptaments.

Iihe eyctent of its commerce.

TIhe Venetian commerce wvas an inexhauf-

tible f~oure of opulence. All the nations 14
Europe depended upon them, not noly1 for the
commodities o'f the East, bunt for, variouzs manu-
faaures Afabica~ted by them alone, or finished
wi~th a dexterity a1nd elegancqe unknowln in other;
countries. From t~his extensive c~ommertc4, the~
slate derived sauch immtenfe fapplies, as conceal-
ed there vices in its confkitution which I have
m-entioned; azld enabled it to k eep on foot such ar-
mies , as were not only an over-match for thq~

'force which any of its neigh~bours could bring
into the fteld, but were fuff-licient to contend ,
for some time , with the powerful monarchs
beyond the Alps. During~ its firu~nggles with
the· princes ucnited against: it: by the league o~f
Cambray, the repuplic levied sums which, even
In the pr~esent agre, would be deemed confider-
able; and while the king of France paid th~e
exorbitant inmtereft wshich I .have mnentioned ·folr
the ·money adva~nced to him, and the emp~eror,
eager to borrow, but destitute of credit, was
known by the name of Maximilian the Mioney-
less, the Venetians raised whatever sums they
pleas~ed, at the moderate premium of five in
th~e hundred. e)

The .constitution of Florence.

The constitution of Florence was perfe~tlyr

the revers~e o~fthe Venetian. It partookr as much
of the democratticazl turbulence andl licentiouf~efs,
as the other of ariftocratical rigour. Florence,
howtevrer, was a commercial, not a military
democracy. The nature of its inffitutions was
favourab~le to comrmerce~, and th-e geniuzs of the
p'eople was turned towards it. The vaft~i wealth
wh~ich the family of Mledici had acquired by
trade, together with the magnificence, the ge-
nerofityI, and the virtue of the first Cosmo~,

gave him s~uch an ascendant over the aff~ec~ions
os well as the councils of his countrymen , that:
though the forms of popular government were
preserved, though the various departments of
administ~ration were filled bjr mag~iffrates diftin-
guifhed by the ancient names, and elet~ed in
the afaLal manner, he was in reality the head
of the commonwealth; and in the station of a
private citizen, he pofifeffed fuzpreme authority.
Cofmno tranfinitted a confiiderable deg-ree of this
power to his des~cendants, and during the greater
part of the fifteenth century, the political slate
of florence was extremnely finguxlar. The appear-
ance of republican government subsist~ed , the
pyeople were patironately attachred to its, and on
some occasions contended warmly for their pr;-
vileges, and yet they permitted a single family
to affa~me .the dire~tionz of their affirs , al-
most as abfolurtely as if' it ~had been, formally
invefied with soverei~gn power. .The jealodyt
of the Mnedici c~oncurred wiith the comPmercial
fpyirit of the Florentines, in putting the mili-
tary force of the republic urpon the fai~me fuooting
with that of the other Itlian states. The troops,
which the Florentines employed in their wiars,
consisted almnoft entirely of mercenary s~oldiers,
furnis~hed by the Condottieri, or leaders of bands,
wrhom they took into their pay.

Charles, counrt of Anjon, the brother of St.
Louis king of Francd, undertook this; and. he
received -fromn the popes .the investiture oqf the
kingdom of' Naples and Sicily as a fief held of
the Holy See. The count of Anjou's efforts·
were ctrowned wvith" faccefh; Mlanfred fell in
battle; and le took poffe~ilon of the vacant
throne. But soon after·, Charles fiillied the
~glory which he had acquired, by the injaftice
and cruelty with which he put to death, by
the hands of the executioner, Conradin, the
last prince of the ·honlfe of Swabia, and the
rightful heir of the Neapolitan crown. That
gallant youngs prince af1'erted his title, to the
last,- with a; courage worthy of a better fate.
On the fbca~fold, he declared Peter, at that time
prince, and fooln after king of Aragon., who had
married IVIanfred's only daughter, his heir;, and
throwing his glove aamong· the people, he' enl-
treat-ed that it might be carried .to Peter, as the
fyrmbol by which he conveyed all his rights to

to r~oyalty, by the d~eath of Conradin, concur-
red with ;ambition, in prompting Peter to take

centuries, the houses of Arag~on and Anjou
contended for the crown of Naples, Amidst a
f~uccefilon of revolutions more rapid, as welta;s
of crimes more atrocious,. than what occur in
the hiflory of almost any other kingdom, mo-
narchs, sometimes of the Aragonefe line, and
fbmetimes of the Angevin, were f'eated on the
throne. At lenght: (A. D. x434.) the princes
of the house of Aragon obtained s~uch firm
poffefion of this longdif~puted inheritance, that
they tranfinitted it quietly to a baffard branch
of their family k)~.

The race of the Ang~evin krings, however,

was not extinat; nor had they relinquithed their
title to the Neapolitan crown. The count of

conveyed all his rights and pretenilons to LouisXI.
and to hisfucceffors. Charles VIII,, as Ihave al-
ready related, crossed the Alps (A.D.x494.) aLt the

his ,daug~hters in marriage to John Galeazzo
Vis~conti, the first duke of MVilan, from whom
he had. r~eceiv~ed considerable sa~ms. Valentine
Vitconti, one, of the children of this marriage,
married her cousin, Louis , duke of Orleans,
the only brother of Charles,VI. In their mar-
riag~e con'tra&t, which the pope confirmned, it

'was fkipulated that, ,upon failure of heirs male

in the family of Viifoonti, the dutchy of M~ilan
thould des~cend to the pofkerity of Valentine
and the duke of Orleans. That event: took
place. In the year one thousand four hun-
dred and fortyfeven, Philip Miaria., the laftprince
of the ducal family of Vifoonti, died. Va-
rious comnpetitors pretended to th e fucceilion.
Charles, duke of Orleans, pleaded his right to
it, founded on the marriage-contraRt of his mo-
ther Valentine Visconti. Alfonso king of Na-
ples claimed it in consequence of a will made
by Ph~ilip Mdaria .in his favour. The emperor
contended that, upon the ex tin~ion of male
ifirue in the family of Tifconti, the fief return-
ed to the fuiperior lord, and ought to be re-·
annexed to the empire. The people of 1Milan,
fmnitten with that love of liber ty wh~ich prevail-
ed among the Italian states, declared against
the dominion of a~ny malfter, and established a
republican form of government.

But during the firuggle among t~o many com-

petitors, the prize for which they contended

was seized by one from whom none of them
apprelhended any: danger. Francis Sforza, thee
natural son of Jacomuzzo Sforza , whom his
courage and abilities had elevated from the
rank of a peasant to be one of the most exti-
nent and powerful of the Italian Condottieri,
rhaving~ succeed~ed. his father in the command of
the adventurers wlho follow6ed his standard ,
had married a natural daug~hter of the lafti duke
of Muila~n. Uipon this f hadow of a title Francis
founded his pretenflons to the dutchy, which
.he fixpportedl with fath talents and valour, as
placed him at lafl: on the ducal throne. The
virtues, as well as abilities, with which he
governed, iniducing his fiibj~e~ts to forget tlhe
-defe~ts in his titl~e, he trans~mitt~ed his domi-
nions qluiitlyT to his son; from whom they de-
fbenlded to his grandson. He was murdered
by his grand-uncle Ludovico, furnarned the
M~oor, who took poffemronl of the dutchy ; and
his right to it was confirmed by the iniveftiture
of the emperor Maximilian in the year one
thousand four hundred and ninety-four. ofp

Louis XI., who took pleasure in depreflrug

the princes of the blood-, and who admired the
political abilities of Francis Sforza, would not:

-To this progress, a fa~dden .Iop was put

by the invasion of the Saracens or VLoors.
~ The Go0ths coul~d not withfiand' the efforts of
their enthusiastic valour, which rubd aed Spain,
with the fame impetuous rapidity that di~ftin-
g~uith'es all the operations of their arms. Thek
:conquerors introduced~into thek country in which
they fettled, the IVahometan religion, the Ara-

th~er with that tasse for the~arts, and that love
of elegance and sp~lendour, wh~ich the Caliphs
had begun to cultivate amnong'·their' flibj~e~s.

The Christians gradually recover dominion in Spaiid.

SSuch Gothic nobles as dirdained to ~ufibbmi

to the 1Moorish yoke , fled for refuge to' the
inaccelliible mountains of Afaiurias. There they
cork~forted themselves with enjoying the exercise
of the Chriftiatn religion, andl with maintaining

ed by thany of the~ boldest and mo~st warlike
amonag their countrymen , they fakllied out upon
the adjacent settlements of the 1Vloors in finall
parties; but venturing only upon short excur-
fions at firit, they were satisfied with plunder
and revenge , without thinking of conquest.
By degrees , their firength increafled , their
views, enlarged, a regular government was efta-
bilifhed among them, an~d theyT began to aim at
extending their territories. While they pushed

on their attacks with the unremitting ardour ,
excited by zeal for religion, by the ~deiire of
vengeance, and by the hope of res~cuing their
country from opprefflion; while they conduated
their operations. with the couarage natural to mren
who had. no other occupation but war, and who
were fkrang-ers to all the arts which corrupt or
enfeebile the mind, the 1Woors gradually loft ma,-
ny of the advantages to which they had been
indebted for their first faccefs. They threw off
all dependence on the Caliphs; *) they negleft-
ed to pref'erve a clos~e conne~t~ion with th~eir couni
trymen in Africa; their empire in Spain was
Epli~t into many fnatllkingdoms; the arts whicha
they cultivated , together: with the luxury to*·
wh~ich there gave rife, relaxed, in s~ome :mea-
sure, the force of their. military ~institution,
and abated the vigour of their warlike spirit.
SThe I~Yor00s, however, continued still to ble as
gallant people , and poffeffed great resources.
According to the magnificent style of the Spa-
nifh historians, eight cent~uries of almoff unin-
terrupted ·war elapt'ed , and three toufand seven

different letaders , each fordiied the territrory
which he had wrested ftiom the commonl enemy,
into an -indepeirdent fla~tte. Spain was di~vided
into as many separate kingdcoms as it contained
pgrovinces 4 in each city of note , a petty mo-
nairch eftablit'hed his hronie; and affuzmed all the

enfgnsof oyaty.In a series of y~ears, how-

ever, by the fualj eients of intermarriages,
oli legal fucceffolo, or conquest, all ther~e infe-.
rior principalities were annexed to the more
powerful kingdoms of Cafitie and of Arag~on.
Apt lengtlh, by· the fortunate inarri-age of Ferdi-
nand and ~isabella, the for~mer the hereditary
moniarch of Aragon, and the latter ralifed to thle
throne of Castile by -the affe~tion of her ~fubje~ts,
all the Spanish c~o-wns were E4·8 I united I and
dethended in the A~me iine. -
Their ancient cuftomzs and laws referved' amidst al tie~ir revo.

lutions , whichr renders their itate in fom e degree limrilar to~
that~ of 'other nlatioins of Europe.

From this period, the political conflitution

of Spain began to aifume a regular and uniform
appear~atce'; the genius of government may be
delineated , and the progres~s of its laws and
manners may be traced , with certainty.
19twuithfi~anding the singular reviolution which
the invaflon of the Mloors occasioned in Spain,
and the peculiarity of its fate, in being to long
f~ubjeated to the Mahometan yoke, the cufomnsr
·intredaced by the Vandals and Goths had taken
such deep root, and were fb thoroughly incor-
porated wvith the frsame of its government, that

in every province which the Christians recover-
ed frlom the Moors, we find the condition of
individuals, as well as the political coniftitution,
nearly ~the fame as in other nations of Europe.
Ltands were held by the fame tenure; jaftice
was dis~pensed in the - fame form; the fame pri-
yileges were claimed by the nobility 4 and the
fame power exerc-ised by the Cortes, or gene-
r1al assembly of the kingdom.

Severatl circumffances contributed to secure

this permanence of the feudal institutions in
Spain , no~thwu·ithff anding the conquest of the
Mboors, which feemned to have overturned them.
Each of the Spaniarlds, as preser~ved their inde-
pendence , ad~hered to their ancient: cuffoms,
nlot only from attachment to them, but out of·
antipathy to the MVoors, to whole ideas concern-
ing property and government these customs
were totally repugnant. Even· among the Chris-
tians, w~ho sUbmitted to the Moorit~h con quer-
ors , and cod~ented to become their fabje~ts,
ancient cuffoms were not entirely- abolitChed.
They were permitte~d to retain their rel~igion,
their laws concerning private property , t~heir
forms of adminiffering juffice, asad their mode
of levying taxes. The followYers of MahL~omet:
are the only enthrifiaflts wiho have united the
[pirit of toleration wi.th zeal for making prose-
Ilytes, and wkho, at; the fame time that they
tookr arms to propagate the do~trine of theirt
Prophet , permitted such a~s would not embragq

it, to andhere to their own tenets, and to prac-
tif~e their own rites. To this pec~uliarity in the
genius of the M~ahometan: religion , as well as
to the deiire which the Moors ha~d, of reconcil-
ing the Chrif~tiarns to their yoike, it was owing-
that the ancient: manners and laws. in S ain far-
vived the violent thock . of a cosque~ft, and
were permi~ttedi to fabliff, notwithstanding the
i~ntrodu~ion of a new religion and a new form
of government into that country. It is obvious ,
from all there particulars, that the Christians
muff have. found it extremely easy to· reefitab-
lifh manners and governmerit on thfeir ancient
foundlations , in those provinces of Spain wYhich
they wr;efied facceffively from the Mroors. A
considerable part of the people retained fach a
fondnes~s for the cuftomns, and fuchs a reverence
for the laws of their anlceffors, that, withing
to feet3 them completely reffored, they were not
only willing but eager to refa~me the former,
and· to recognize the authority of the latter.

Certain peculiarities ini their conhitituition and laws.

But though the feudal form- of government,

with all the institutions which chara~te~rize it,
was thus preserved entire in Caitile and Ara-
gon, as. well as in all the kingdoms which de-
pended on thiere crowns , there· were certain
peculliarities in their political constitutions,
which diftinguith them from those of any other
country in Europe.

The prerogative more limited ,- and the immunities of th·e peo.

p~le more extenlive.

The royal prerogative, extremely limited

in every feu~dal kingdom, was circumficribed,
th Spain, within fazch narrow biounds, as re-
du~ced. the po~wer of the sove~reign almost· to no-
thing. The -privileges of the nobility were
vast in proportion, and. extended to far, as to·
border, onl abfbolate independence. The imm~u-
nitaof the citi~es were great, they poffeffed
considerable influence in the Cortes, and they
aspired at obtaining more. Such a slate of s~o-
ciety, in which the political machin~e was foa
ill- adjuffed, and the several membres of the
legislature to improperly balanced, produced
interior difbrders in the kingdoms of Spain ,
which rose beyond the pitch of turbulence and
anarchy afual under the feudal government. The
whole tenor of the Spanish hifforyr confirms the
truth of this obfertvation ; and when the mutinous
spirit·, to which the genius of their policy gave
birth and vigour, was no longer restrained and
overawed by the immediate dread of the Mo~orish
amtis,, it broke out into more frequent infurre.tions
against t~he government of their princes , as well
a'cs more o~utrageous insults on their dignity, than
o~ccur in th~e annals of anyr other country. The~e:
were accompanied at fame times with more
liberal sentiments concerning the rights of the
people, :it o6ther timies with more elevated no-
tions ~conceivingr the privileges of the nobles,
than3 were common .in other nations.

Intfa'nces of this.

In the principality of Catflonia, which

was annexed to the kingdom of Aragon, ·the
impatience of the- people to obtain the redress
of their grievances· hav~ing prompted them to take
arms a~gainst their fevereign John II., (A. D.
m462.) they, by a solemn deed, recalled the
oath of allegiance whichi theyr ha~d t~worn to. him,
declared him and his poss erity to be unworthy of
t'he throne, p) and endeavoured to a republican
forim of governmen~t, in order to fiecure the perpe-
tnal joyment of that liberty, after which they as~-
pired, q) Nearly about the fame period, the in-
dctignation of the· Castilian nobility against the;
weak and flagitious adminiffration of Henry IV,
having led th~em to comnbine ag~ainst hiim, they
arrogated·, as one of the privileges belonging to
their order, the right of trying and of pafling
s~entence on their sovereign. That the exercise
of this power might~ be as publIc and solemn,
as the pretenilon to it wvas bold, they faummon-
ed all thbe nobility of their party .to meet at
Avila; (A.D. r46S.) a spacious theatre was ere~t~-
ed in a plain, without: the walls of the town;
an imag~e, representing the king, was seated
on a throne, clad in royal robes, with a crown
on its head,- a feceptre in itit hand, and the

sword of justice by its fide. The accusation
ag-ainit the king was read , and the fenten-
ce of d~eposition was pronounced, in presence
of a numerous assembly. At the close of the
first article of the charge, the archbis~hop ofTo-
ledo advanced, andl tore the crown from the
head of the image; at the clof'e of the second,
t'he Conde de Placentia snatched the sword of
juffie from its iide; at the close of the third,
the Conde de Beneventh wrefied the ·feeptre
from its hand; at the clofCe of the lakt, Don
Diego Lopes de Staniga tumbled it headlong
from the throne. APt the f'ame instant, Don
.Alfonlfo, Henry's brother, was proclaimed king
of Castile and 3Leon in its Rtead. r)

The moit daring leaders of fa~tion would

not have ventured on these measures, nor have
conduked- them with s~uch public ceremony, if
the sentiments of the people concerning the ro-
yal dignity had not been to formed by the laws
and policy, to which they were accustomed
both in Cast~ile and Catalonia, as prepared them
to approve of fach extraordinary proceedings,
or to acquiesce in them.

The conititution and government of Aragon.

In Aragon, the form, of governnient was

monarchical, but the genius and maxims of it
were purely republican. The kings, who were
long ele~tive, retained only the Bhadow of powl

or parliament of the klring~omn. This fuprretne
akem'bly was comparfed of four different- arms
or members. The nobility of the first rank.
The equeltrian order, or nobility of the second
clarCs. The reprelbutatives of the .cities and.
towns, whof'e, right to a place in the Co~rtes, if
we may give credit to the hifforians of Aragorl,
was co~val with t~he conftilitation. The eccle-
flaftical' order, composed of the dignitaries of
the c~hurch, together with th-e representatives
of th~e inferior clergy. s) No law could pitfs,
in this assembly without the aff'ect of every fin-

out the permifiion' of Cortes , no tax could be,
imrpofed; nor war could be declared; nor peace
concluded; no money could be coined; nor any·
alteration be made in the current fpeie. u) The
power of reviewing the proceedings of all· in-
fertior courts, the privileg-e iof infple~ing every
department of adminlifration-, and th~e right of
redrefifing all grievances, belonged to the Cor-
tes. Nor did those who .conceived thiemfelves
to be aggrieved, address the Cortes-in the hum-
ble tone of supplicants, and petition for redres~s;
they demanded it as the birth-right of freemen,
and req-uired the guardians of their liberty to

laid before them. x) This sovereign court: was
held, during several centuries, every year; but,
in consequence of a regulation introduced about
the beginningr of the fourteenth century, it was
convoked from that p~erio~d only once in two
years. After it was assembled, the king had
no right ~to prorogue or dissolve it without its
own consent; and the efih~~~on continued forty
da ys. y)

Of~ce and ju~rifdiaionz of the Juftiza.

Not faitisfied with having ere~ced such for-

midable barrierr against the encroachments of
the royal prerogative , nor withing to commit
the g~uardianship of their liberties to the vigi-
lance and authority of an assembly, similar to
the 'die ts, state-s -general, and parliaments , in
which the -other feudal nations placed s~o much
confidence, the Aragonef~e had recourse to an
inffitution peculiar to themfielves, and eleC~ed
a juftiza or s~upreme judge. This ma~giffrate,
wvhofe office bore some resemblance to that of
the Ephori in ancient Spar ta, aaed as the pr-o-
t~etor of the people, and the comptroller of the
prince. Thie person of the Jufftiza was sacred,
his power and jurifdi~tion almoit unb2ounded.
He was the s~upreme interpreter of the laws.

I the royal judges, as well as from those appoint-

he could iriterpofe by· hi own authrority, p~ro-

anore thie party accused to the Manifestation , or

exerted with no less vigour and ileffA in furper-
inten~ding the adminiffration of government,
Sthan ina regulating the cours~e of jtiffice. It wag
the prerog~ative of the Juffiza 'to inf~ped the

the regal power circumforibed within narrow limits.

It is evidenit, from a bare enumeration 'of

th~e privileges of the A~ragonefe Cortes, as well
as of the rights belonging to the Jufizia, that a
very finall portion of power remained in thie
hands of the king. TheAr'agonef~ie seem to have
been solicitous that thieir monarchs t~hould know
and feel this state of impotence, to which they
were reduced. Even in fwvearing allegiance to
their feovereigrn, an a&t which ought naturally
to be accompanied wiith profefflons of fiibmifiron
and ref~peft, they devited an oath, in fuzch a
form, as to remind him of his dependence on
his fu~bjeas. ,, We,' " said the Juffiza to the
king in name of his high fpiyiited barons, " who
are each of us as good, and who are altogethel-
axore powerful than you, promise obedience to
your government, if you, mamntain our rights
and liberties; but if not, not. "C onformnably to
this oath, they eftabiifhed it as a fundamental
ar~ticle in their conftitutiorn, that if the king
thould violate their rights and privileges, it was
lawful fror the people to ditclaim hJim as their
fevereign, and to eled anoth~er, even though
a heathen, in his pllace a.) The attachment
of the Aragonefe to this singular confjitution of
government was extreme, and their refpe~t for
it approached to fixuperftitious veneration II).

Con~itution and government of Castile;

In C6affile, there were not such peculiari-

ties in the form of government;, .as to effablifh
any remarkab-le -diftitJ~tion betw~een it and that
of the other European nations. Th~e executive
spart of government was committed to the king,
but with a prerogative extremely liniite~d. The
legillative authority resided in the 6Cortes;, which
was composed of the nobility, the- dignified ec-
clefiaftics, and the repretentatives of the cities.
The ailembly of the Cortes in Castile was .very
ancient, and seems to hatve be~en co'val with
th~e constitution. The members of the thlree-
different orders, who :had a right'offiuffr~ag~e,
inet in one place, and delibe'rated as one col-
le8:ive body; the dlecillons of which were. re-
gulated, by the s~entiments of the majority. The
right of impoiitig ta~xes, of enating laws, and
of redressing grievances, belonged to this .as-
f~embly; and in order to secure the a~ssent of the

it was us~ual in the Cortes to take no' step to-
wards granting money , until all busines~s relative
to the public welfhre was concluded. The reh
prefentatives of cities se~em to have obtained a
f~eat v~ery early in; the Cortes of Caftlile, and
soon acquired fach influence and credit, as were
vd'ry uncommhon, at a period when the fplen-
dour and p~re'-eminence of the nobility had eclipf-
ed or annihilated all other orders of men. Th~e
number of members from citi2es- bore suc~h ·a
prbportion to that of the whole colleftive body,
as rendered them extremely refpe~table in the
CorteiK K) ~The degree· of econfideration, which
they poffeffed in the state, may be estimated bjr
Une event. U~pon the death of John I. (A. D. 1390)S
a council· of regenlcy wvas appointed to gFovern
thih kingdom during the minority of his son.
It was composed of an equal number of noblemen,
and of deputies chosen by the cities; the latter
'were admitted to the fame rank , and invested
with the fkme powers, as prelates and grandees
of the first order. c) But though the members

government; yet the nobles, notw\ith~anding
ther~e acquisitions of the connons, continued
to aftert the privileges of their order, in oppa-
fit~ion to the crown, in a tonle extremely. high
Threre was not any .body of nobility in Europe,
more difting~ulhed- for independence of spirit,
baughtinefh of dleportment, and hold pretenlions,
than that of Castile. The history of that mo-
narchy affods the mast firikring· examples of the
·yigilance with which they observed, and of the
rvigo-ur wit which. they opposed every i'heme
of their kings, thait tended to encroach on their
juir~i~taion, to diminif h their, dignity , or to
-abridge their power. Even in their ordinary
-inte~rcourse with their monarchs, theypreferved
£uch a confcioufaefs of their rank, that the no-
ibles of the s~irs order claimed it as~ a privilege
.to be covered in the royal presence,- and ap-
proached their forereig~ns rather as equals than
as fibj~eas.

The confient~tion of the s~ubordinate monar-

Ahies, which depended ·on the crowns of Castile
·and Aragon, nearly res~embled that of the king-
dom.- to -which they were annexred. In all of

3arious causes of the limited aulthority of the Spainith mronarchs,

An attentive obs~ervation of the singular ii-

tnation of Spain, as well as .the various events

wrhich

·i~which occurred there, from the· invallion of' the
M'oors to the union of its kingdoms under Ser-
dlinand, and Is~abella, will: discover thLe ~caus~es to
wYhich all the peculiarities in its political- con-
ftlt~ution I havie pointed out, ought to be as-
cr~ibed .

As' the provinces of Spain were wrefied

from the IVl~ahometanrs gradually and with diffi-
culty, the nobles,~ who followed the ithndard
of any eminent leader in there wars, conque~r-
ed not for him alone, but for themselves. They
clai~e~d a Chare in the lands wihich their val~our
had torn from the enemy, and their prosperity
and power increas~ed, in proportion as the ter-·
ri~tory· of the prince ex~tended.

During thieir perpetual wars wi.th the Moors,

the moanarchs of Spain depended so,~ much on
their nobles, that it becamle· necessary to conci-
liate their good will by fucceffiive grants of new
honours and privileges. By the time that any
prince could establish his dominion in a conquer-
ed' province, the greater part of the property
was parcelled ·out by him amnongr his barons,
wcith fisch jur~ifdi~tion and imrmunities~ as Paifed
the-m a:lmrof to sovereign pow~er.

At: the fame time, the kingdopms ere~ted iti

so many different corners of Spnain, were extre-
mely inconsiderable. The petty monarch was

could neither command much refped, nor pof-
fefis great power; and noblemen , inbi nearly on
the fa~me level·, could not lookr up to them with
that reverence, with which the fe~vereigns of
`the great monarchies in Europe were; viewed
by their fabjeats. LL)

These· circumitances concurre~d in exalting

the nobility, and in depreffixng- the royal autho-
rity; there wve-re other caures wh~ich raised the
cities in Spain, to confrderaztion and power.

As the open country, `during the wars wCTith

the Moo0rs, was perpetually exposed· the the
excuriions of the enemy, w~ith whoim no peace
or truce was to permanent as to pr~ove anly lnft~-
ing security, self -preservation obliged peifons
of all ranks to fix their residence in places of:
Arength. The castles of the. barons, which,
in other countries, afforded a commodilous re-
treat from the depredations of banditti, or fr~om
the tratifient violence of any interior commo-
tion, were unable to resist an enemy whose ope-
rations were condu~ed with regular and perse-
vering vigour. Cities, in which great num-
bers united _for their mutual defence, were the
only places in which people could fix their refi-
dence with any profpedt of safety. To this was
owing the rapid growth of those cities in Spain

them, as to an asylum; and there, the greater
part of thos~e who took the field against the MaI-
hometans, eltablifhed their fa~milies.

Each of ther~e cities, during a longer or

thorter course of years, was the capital of a
little £tate, and enjoyed all the advantages which
accelerate the increase of inhabitants in evrery
place that: is the! feat of governme~nt.

The nurmber of cities in Spain, at the be-

g~inning of the fifteenth century, was considerable,
and they were peopled far beyond the piropor-
tion which was commnon in other parts of Europe,
except in Italy and the LowT-Countries. The
Mloors had inltroduced manu~fa~t~ures into thiofe
cities, while unider their dominion. The Chris-
tians, who, by intermnixtuxre with them . had
learned their arts, continued to cultivate th'efe.
The trade of fCeveral of the Spanish towns ap-
pears to have been considerable; and the spirit
of commerce continued to pref'erve the number
of th eir inhabitants , as the sense of danger had first
induced them to crowd together.

As the Spanish cities were populous, many

of the inhabitants were of a ranki fupertor to
thlofe who resided in towns in other countries
of Europe. That cau~e , which contributed
chiefly to their population, affEeaed equally per-
sons of every coxidition, who flocked thither
promis~cuously, in order to find filelter,- or in
hopes of makring a fland there against the enemy,
with greater advantage than in any other Rtation.

O 3

The peribns electred as their representa-tives in
the Cortes by the cities, or· promoted to offices
Sos truss and dignity in the government of the
community, were often, as will appear from
StranfaEions which I Ithall -hereafter relate, of.
s~uch conidera'ble rankl in the kingdomn, as re-
fle~ted luffre on their constituents, and on the
11ations wherein they were placed.

As it was imnpoffible to carry on a conti-

nual. war a~gainst the Moor~s, without som~e other
inilitary force, than that which the a~rons were
obliged to bring into the field, in consequence
of the feudal tenures, it became necessary to.
have iome troops, particularly a body; of light
cavalry, in conftiant pay. It was one of the
privileges of thle nobl~es, that their lands were
exempit from the burden of taxes. The charge
of funpporting the troops requisite for the public:
safety, fell wholly upon the cities; and their
kings , being obliged frequently to apply to
them for aid, found it necessary to gain their
favour by conceflions, which not only ex tendeed
their immunities,. but added to their wea~lth and.
power,.

Wih~n the in~fluence of all there' circum-~

flances, peculiar to Spain, is added to the ge-
neral and common cauzfes, which contributed to
a~ggrandize cities in other countries of Europe,
this will fully accort for the - extensive privileges
which they acquired, as; well as, for the extra-

ordinary consideration to which they attained,
in all th-e Spanish kningdoms. 1VIM)

Mneafu~res of ·different princes in order to extend their power;

By there exocrbitant privileges of the nobi-

liTy, and this unus~ual power of the cities in
Spain, the royal prerogative was hemmed in
on every fide, and reduced within very narrow
bound s. Sensible of this, and impatient of such
I eftraint, different monarchs endeavoured, at:
various jun~tures, to enlarge their own juarift
di~tion, and to circumscribe that of thleir s~ub-
je~ts. Their power, however, or theirabl itie
were to unequal to the undertaking, that their
effor-ts were attended with little fazccef~s.

p~articularly of Ferdinand and I~sabella,

B~ut when Ferdinand and Isabella found

themselves at the head of the united kingdoms
of Spain, and delivered from the danger and
interruption of domes~tic.~ wars, they wer~e not
only in a condition to resume, but were able
to prosecute with advantage , the schemes of
extending the prerogative, w~hich their ancest~ors
had attempted in vain. Ferdinand's profound
sagacity in concerting hi's meaifutes, his pers~e-
vering induffry in condu~ting them , and his
uncommon address in carrying thent into execu-
tion , fitted him admnirably for an undertaking
w~hich required: all there talents.

EFerdiinanld's diffierent k'hemles for abridging- the privileges and

pow er ofE the nobility.

As ~the overgrown power , and high pre-

·tenflons of the nobility were what the mnonarchs
of Spain fel~t moss sensibly, and b~ore with the
greatest~ imprttience, the great objeat of Ferdci-
nand's policy was to~reduce these within more

the Knights Te~mplars and of St. John of Jera-

prompted persons of every rank to beffow such
li~beral donations on ~thos~e hIoly wisarriors, that,
in a thort time, they engroffeid a considerable:
·share in the property and wealth of the king-
dom. The mafterfh~iips of these orders came to
be Rtations of the greatest power and opulence

vant~g~e , however , of an opportunity which
the ftiate: of his kingdoms and the s~pirit of his;
people prefeated him, in order to undeirmine
wihat: he durit not assault. The incessant depre-i
dations of the Moors , the want of difrcipl'ine
among thle troops which were employed to op-
pose them, the fr~equent civil wars betw~een the
crown and the nobility, as well as the undif-
cerning rage with virhicLh the barons carried on
their private wars with each other , filled 3t11
the provinces of Spain with disorder. Rapine,
ourtrage , and murder became t~o common , as
not only to interrupt commeree, but in a great
meafuzre to furplend all intercourfie between one
place and another. That fEecurity and prote~ion,
which men expedt from entering into civil` so-
ciety , ceased alm~ost totally. Interior order and
police, while the feudal inflitutions remained
in vi~gour, were s~o little objeats of attention,
and the adminifkration of juffice was t'o extre-
mely feeble, that it: would have been vain to
have· expei~ed relief from the eflabif~hed laws
of the ordinary judges· But the evil became
to intolerable , and the inhabitants of cities ,
who were the chief· fufferers , grew so impa-
tient of this anarchy , that self -preservation
forced. thema to have recours~e to an extraoprdi.
Ilary remedy. ~About the middle of the thirt-
eePnth ce~ntry, (1260.) the c~itie in the kingdon
of Aragon, and, after their exemple, thos~e in
Castile, formed themselves into an aff'ociation,

diing uithed by the name of ~the Holy Brother-
hoaod. They exa~ted a certain cont~ribut:ion-from~n
each of the associated towns ; they levied a
consider~able body: of troops·, in order to proted~
travellers , and -to p ur sue criminals; -they ap-
pbinted judges, who opened their courts in vari-
ous parts of the kingdom. Whoever was guilty
of muncrder, robbery, or of anly a&t that violated
th~e public peace, and was s~eized by the troops
of the Brotherhood, was carried before judges
of their nomination, who,- without paying any
regard to the exclusive and sovereign jurifdiffion,
,which the lord. of the place might claim, tried
a~nd condemned the criminals. By means of
this , thie prompt and irnpartial adminiff ration
of jutie 'was reffored; and together with it,
internal tranquillity and order began to return,
The ~nobles alone murmured at this falatary in-
ftitution. They complained of it as an encroach-
ment on one of their most valluable privile-
ges. They rem-onfirated against it in an high
tone; and, on some occasions, refused to grant
any aid to the crown, unless it were abolifhied.
Ferdinand, hlowever, was ·sensible not only of '
the good effets~ of the Holy Brotherhood with
refpe& to the police of his ki~ngdoms, but per-
ceived its tendency to abridge, and at length
to annihilate , the territorial juridiiition of the
nobility. He countenanted the institution on
every occallon. He s~upported it with the whole
force of royal authority; and., besides the ex-

pedients employed by him in common with the
other monarchs of Europe, he availed himself
of this: institution, which was peculiar to his
kingrdom , in~ order to limit and aboli~sh that in-
dependenrt jurisdi~tion of the nobility , which

the prince, than with the order of focietyv OO),

But though Ferdinand by there measures

considerably enlarged the boundaries of prero-

power far beyond what any of his predecessors
had enjoyed,· yet the limitations of the royal
author-ity, as - w·ell as the barriers against its
encroachments , continued to be many and
i1rong. T'he s~pirit of liberty was vigorous
among the people of Spain; the s~pirit of inde-
pendence was higrh amongr the nobility ; and!
thoughi the love of g-lory, peculiar to the Spa-
niards in every period of their history, prompted
themn to s~upport Ferdinand wTith zeal in his
foreign operations, and to afford him fushk aid
as enabled him not only to undertake but to
execute great enterprizes; he reigned over his
fu~bje~s w~ith a jurifdi~tion less extensive than
that of any of the great monarchs in Europe.

Confitation and government of France.

The ancient govern'nent and laws in France-

so, n~early resembled thos~e of the other feudal
ki3angd~oms , that such a1 deta~il with refpe~t: to
them as was neceilk~ry, in order to convey some
idea of the nature and effefts of the peculiar in-
ftitutions wh~ich took place. in Spain , would be
furperfluous. In the view which I have e xhi-
bi~ted of the means- by which the French mo-
narchs acquir~ed Stuch- full command of the na-
tional .force of their kingdom, as' enabled them
to engage in exterdilve s~chemes of foreign ope-
ration., I have already pointed out the great
fieps ~by which they advanced towards a more
ample poffeflion of political power, and a, more
uncontrouled exercise of their royal prerogative.
All that now remains is to take notice ~of fuxch
particulars" in the constitution of Fraznce , as
fTerve either to diftinrrguifh it from that of other
cou~ntries, or tend ,to throw any light on the
tranf~a;tions of that period, to which the follow-
ing hiffory extends.

Power of the general assemblies under the first race of kin~gs.

U~nder the French monarchs of the first race,

Ithe royal prerogative was very inconsiderable.
The general afemnbies of the nation, which

met annually at slated seasons, extended their
authoritiy to every department of govern~ment.
"The power of elefting king~s, of enac~ing laws,
of redireirng grievances , of conferring dona-
tions on the prince, of pafiing judgment in the
lass resort, writh res~pect to every person and to
every cause, resided in this great convention of
the nationr.

Under the f'econd.

Under the second race of kings, nlotwith-

flanding5 the pow~er and splendour which the
conquests of Charlemagne added to the crown,
the general aff~emrblies of the nations continued
to poffer~s ex~tensive authority. .The right ofde-
termining which of the royal family t'hould be
placed on the throne, was veited in them. The
princes, elevated to that digrnity by their sus-
frage , were accuffomed regula~rly to call and
to consult them with refpeat to every affair of
importance to the irate, and wvithout their coni-
fEent no law was passed, and no new tax was
levied.

Under· the third.

B~ut, by the time that Hugh Capet , the

father of the third race of kings, took po~effxon
of the throne of France, such changes had hzap.
pened in the political slate of the kingdom, as
confiderablyi affe~ted the power and jurididition
of the greneral a~embly of the nation. The

.royal authority, in the hands of the degenerate
po~erity of Charlemagne , had dwuindled into
infig-nificanrce and cont~empt. Every confider-
able proprietor of land had formed his territory
into a barony, almnoft independent of the fo~ve-
reign.- The dukes or governors of provinces,
.the counts or .governors of townms and small
diffriats, and the great officers o:fth~e crown,
had rendered these dignities, originally granted
only during pleafare or for life, hereditary in
their famili-es. ~Each of these had usurped alll
the rights which hitherto ha~d been deemed the
diftin~ionis of royalty, particularly the privile-
ges of dispensing- jaftice within their own do-
m~ains, -of coining money, and of .wagingr war.
Every difkriat was go~verned by local cu~toms ,
ackinowledge~d a diftin~t lord , -arfd pursued a
Sfeparate interieft. The formality of doings ho-

: ~ mage to their sovereign_, was alm~ost the only

a&t of fubje~tion which ha~ughty barons would
perform , and that bound them no farther thart

nations as forming, one body, or eitablifh com-
mon regulations to be of equal force in every
part. Within the Immediate domains of the
crown, the king might publis~h laws, and they
were obeyed , because there he was acknlowt-
ledged as the only lord. But if he had aimeda
at rendering ther~e general, that would have
alarmed the barons, as an encroachment: upon
the independence of their jurisdicftion. The
barons, with no less: care, avoided the ena~t-
ing of general laws, becaufie the execution of
them must have been verted in the king, and
would have enlarged that paramount power,
which was the objeat of their jealoulfy. Thus,
under the descendants of _Hugh Capet, the Sta-
tes General ( for that was the name by which
the supreme aflrembly of the French nation came
then to be diftinguithed ) loft their leg-ifla-
tive authority, or at least entirely relinquit'hed
the exercif'e of it. From that period, the ju-
risdi~tion of the States General! extended no
farther than to thie impolition of new taxes,
the determination of queffians with refpe £ to
the right: of f~uccefi~on to the crown, thelbe~tt-
ling of the regency when the preceding monarch
had not fixed it by his will, and the presenting
remonfirances enumerating thle grievances of
which the nation wiftled to obtain redrefis.

As, during s~everal centuries, the monarchs

of Europe seldom demanded extraordinary s~ub-
fidies of their frbje~ts, and the other events,

which required the interposition of the States,
rarely occurred,~ their meetings in France were
not fr~equent. T tey were summoned occaflonanlly
I by, their ·kings~, when comepelled by their: wants
,or by their feats tp have recours~e to their aid ; but
,they did not, like~ the Diet in Germ~any, the
Cortes in Spain, or, the parliament in England,
farm 'an essential member of the constitution,
the .regrula~r exertio~n of whose powers was re-
qgufite to give ·vigour and, order to government.

-And thE3 power of levyyog taxes.

Having secured this important acquifi-

tion, th'e fieps which led to the rig~ht of
Imposing· tax~es were rendere~d few and
easy. The people, accuffom-ed to fee their s~o-
vereigns, by their sole authority i'lfue ordinances
which regulated points of the greatest conl
sequence with ref~pea to the property of their
fulbje~ts, were not alarmed when they were
required, by the royal edids, to contribute
certain fumns towards fuxpplying the exigencies
of government, and carring forward the mea-
fures of the nation. WNhen Cha;rles V~II. and
Louis XI. first ventured to exercis~e this new pow-
er, in the manner which I have already de-
fcribed , the gra-dual increafre of the royal
authority had to ]imperceptibly prepared the
m~inds of the people of France for this innovation,
that it excited no commotion in the kingdom,
and seems fearcely to have given rife to any
murmur or complaint,

GovernmJentl of France becomes purely monar·chical.

When the kings of France had thus engrof-

fed every power which can be exerted in go-

naries in constant pay, of declaring war, and
of concluding peace, centered in the crown.

Two things, h~owever, remained, which

moderated the exercis~e of th~e regal prerogative,
a~nd reffrained it within fulch bounds as preferv-
ed the constitution of France from degenerat-
ing intto mbre defpotifin. The rights and pri-
vileges claimed by t~he~ nobilityj muff be confider-
ed as one barr~e~r againfle thle abf'olute dominion
of ·the crown. Though the nobles of France
had loit that political power whfich was veited
in their order as a body, they Rlli retained the
personal rights and pre-eminence which they

derived from their rank. They ·preserved a
confcioufnef's of elevation above other claires of
citizens; .ani exemption from burdens to whLich
they were fubjech; a contemnpt of the occupa-
ti~ons in which they were engaged'; the privilege
of assuming enligns that indicated thieir. di-
guity; a right to be treated with ~a certain de-
gree of deference during peace; and a claim to
various diftin~tions when in th~e field. I3iany
of thes~e pretenflons were not founded on the
words of statutes, or derived from positive laws;
they were defined and ascertained by the ma-
xims of ho~nour, a title more delicate, but no
less faicred. Ther~e rights, established and pror-
te~ted by a principle equally vigilant: in guard-
ing, and intrepid in defending them, are to
the forereign himself objeats of refpe~t anld ve-
neration. Wgherever they stand in its wa~y,
the royal prerogative is bounded. The violence
of a deipot may exterminate fach an order
of men ; but as long as it s~ubsists, and its ideas
of perfbnal diftindtion remain entire, the pow-
er of the prince has limits. g)

As in France the body of nobility wesEi ~ve-

ry numerous , and the individuals of which it
was compos~ed retained an high sense of their
own pre -eminence, to this we may aferibe,
in a great measure, the mode of exrercifing the

t'ain boun~ds jret to it by the ideas which one

owh dignity.
and by the juridi~iion ofP the parliaments, particubarly that of

Pafis.,

The -jurifdition of the parliaments in Fran-

ce 4 particularly that of Paris, was the other
barrlier wjhich 'er~ved to confine the exercise of
th-e royal pr~erog~ativ~e Within certain limits. The
parliament of Paris was originally thle court of
th~e king3s of France, to wNhichi they committed
the fuxpreme admbiniration of juitice withinr
thleir own domains, as well as the powier of
deciding w~ith refpedt to all cafb~s brought be-
fore it by appeals from the courts of the ba-
rons. Wihen, in confeqluence of events and
regulations which have been mentioned for-
merlyr, the time and place of its meetings were

fixed, when not only the form of its proce-
dur~e, but the principles on which it decided,
were rendered regulatr and confiffent, when
every cauf~ie of importance wvas finally determin-i
ed there, and when the people became accuft-
omed to resort thither as to the supreme tem-
ple ofju~ffice, the parliament of Paris rose to
high effimation in the kingdom, its members
acquired dignity, and its decrees were fubmit-l
ted to with deference. Nor was this the only
source of the power and influence which the
parliament obtained. The kings of France,
when they firs~t began to assume the legifiative
power, in order to r~econcile the minds of their
people to this new exertion of prerogative, pro-
duced their ediats and ordinances in the parlia-
rnent of Paris, that they might be approved
of, and registered there, before: they wrere pu-
blifhed and declared to be of authority in the
kingdom. During the intervals betiveen the
meetings of the States General of the ktingdom,
or under those reigns when the States Ge-
neral wtere not assembled, the monarchs of~
France were accuffomed to conul~t, the par.
liament of Paris with refpe-t: to the mot a~r-
duous affairs~ of government, and frequently
regulated their conduff by its advice, in declar-
ing; war, in concluding peace, and in other
tranfa~tions of public concern. Thus there was
·ere~ed in the kingdom a tribunal which became:
the great depository of the laws, and by

the uniform tenour of its decrees, it eff ablithed
.principles of juffice anid forms of proceeding
wrhich were considered -as so sacred, that even
thle sovereign power of the m~onarch durst not
venture to diftegard or to violate them.. The
members of this illulltrious body, -though they
treither poilfs l~egislative authority, nor can be
considered .as the representatives of the people,
:ha~ve avail~ed themselves of the repjutation and
influence which they had. acquired among their
countrymen, in order to make a Band, to the
utmost of their ability, a~gainst every unprece-·
dented and exorbitant exertion of the preroga-
tive. In every period of the French hiflory,
they -have merited the prais~e of being the vir-
tuouts but feeble guardians of the rights and
privileges of the nation. RR)

Codfitation and governrjnent: of the German empire.

The kingdom of France extends to the con-

fines of the German empire, from which Char-
les V. derived his title of highest dignity. In

and complex body at the beginning of the fiix-

Ifj frate under Charlemagne and his descendants.
The empire of Charlem-agne wa~s a firui~ure

pre'ed in so thort a timne, t~hat it could not
be permanent. Under his immediate facceffrr
it began to totter; and it soon fell to pieces.
Thie crow~sn of Germany was separated for ever
~from th~at of France, and the descendants of
Charlemag~ne established two great monarchies
so situated a~s to give rife to a perpetual rival-
Thip and enmity `between them. But the prin-
ces of the race of Charlemagne who were plac-
ed on th-e imperial throne-, were nort altoge-
ther to degenleraIte, as thlofe of the fame family
wTho reigned in France. In the hands of the
former thle royal authority· retained some vri-
gour, and the 'nobles of Germany, though pof-
Afeted of extensive privileges as well as ample
territories, dlid not so early attain independence.
The great offinces of t~he crowtn continued to
be at the dispos~al of the f~orereign, and dur-
ing a long period, fiefs remained in the~ir ori-
ginal state, "wiithout becoming hereditary and
perpetual in the families to which they had
been granted.

Other familie~s aire railed to the imperial di~gnity.

looking towards them, exercifbd the right in-

rad, count of Franconia emperor. After him
Henry of Saxony, and his descendants the three
Othos, were placed, in fazcceffion, on the Im-
perial throne, by the fuffrages of their coun-
trymen. The extensive territories of the Saxon
emperors, their eminent a~bilities and enterpriz-
ing genius, not only added a new vigour to
the Imp'erial dignity, but raised it to higher
power and pre-eminence. Otho the Great march-

army into Italy, and after the example of Char-

power there recognized his aunthority. He creat-

inandate. He annexed the kingdom of Italy to
the, German empire. Elated with his fuxccef~s,
he all'umed the title of Caesar Auguitus. h)

given to government quickly relaxed. The ina-

would have encouraged vassals less enterprizing

new right~s, and to have afFamed new polwers.

prefinnption and violence wver~e accompanied wT~ith
political dif~cernmlent and sagacity. He had ob-
s~erved that the princes and nobles of G~ermanmy
had acquired fa~ch considerable territories and
such extensive juris~diction, as rendered them
not only formidable to the emperors, but dliif-
pos~ed them to· favour any attemt to circum-
Feribe their power. He foresa~w that the eccle-
fiaftics of Germany , raised almost to a level
wc~ith its princes, were ready to support any
person who would Rtand forth as the proteEtor
of their privileges and independence. With
both' of these Gregory negociated and had fe-
cured many devoted adherents among them, be-
fore, hie ventured to enter the lifts against the
head of th~e empire.

*The contests betwceen the popes and! enrperors , and the

c~onsequences of thiefe.

He began his rupture with Henry IV. upon

a pretext that was popular and plausible. He
complained of the v enaliity and corruption wi~th
which the emperor had granted the inveffiture
of benefices to eccleiaftics. H~e contended that

this right belonged to him as head of the church;
he required Henry to confine himself within~
.the boun-ds of his civil jurif~di~ion , and to ab-
flainl for the future fromn farch fCacrilegious en-
croach'ments on the spiritual dominion. All the
ced~ures of the church were denounced against
~Henry, becaus~e he refulfed to relinquith those
payrers which his predeceffrors had uniformly
exercified. T"he mnof considerable of the German
princes and ecclefiaftics were excited to take
arms againfit him. His mother , his wife, his
sons were wrought upon to disr~egard all the
ties of blood as well as of duty, and to join
the party of his enemies. k) Such were the
fauccefsfu~l arts with which the court of Romre
·inflatmed the superst~itious zeal, and conduke~d
the fa~tious spirit of the Germans and Italians,
that an emperor, distinguished not only for
many virtues, but poffeffed of considerable ta-
lents, was at length (A. D. I077.) obliged to
appear as at supplicant at the gate of the castle
in which the pope resided, and to fland there,
three days, bare-footed, in the d~epth of winter
imploring a pardon, which at length he obtained
with diif~iculty. SS).

continued to decline. During· the anarchy of

Several of his; succ~essors weare placed on the

Imperial throne from th-e fame motive ; and almost
every remaining prerogative was wrefied out of
the han~ds of feeble princes unable to exuercife of
to deftend them.

AI total chang6e in the political conltitution of the empire.

During ~t~his period of turbuxlence and confu-

fio--, , the conflituti~on of the G~ermanic body
underwent a total change. The ancient names
of courts; and magiffrates, together with the ori-
ginal forms and appearance of policy, were pre-
fTerved; but such new privileges and jurifdi~tion
were assumed, and so many various rights ekab-
lifheed, that the fam~e species of government no
lonnger fu~bifted. The princes, te great nobi-
lity, the dignified ecclefiaftics, the siree cities
had taken advantage of the interreegnum , which
I~have mentioned , to e~tablifh or to extend their
ufur pation s. Th ey claimed and exercised th e
right ors governing their respective territories
with full fbvereignty. They acknowledged no
fCuperior with refped to any point, relative to
the interior administration and police of their
domains. They enaked-1aws, impose~d taxes,
coined money , declared war, concluded peace,
and exerted every prerogative peculiar to inde-
pendent slates. The ideas of order and poli-
tical union, which had formed the various pro-
vinces of Germany into one body, were enti-
rely loit; and the s~ociety must have dissolved ,
if the forms of ftizdal fabordination hadl not pre-

fertred fach an appearance of" conne~tion or de-
pendence among the various me~mblers of the
community , as pres~erved it from falling to
pieces.

Expedients for putlting an end to this fitate of anarchy.

This bond of union, however, wa~s ext~re-

mely feeble; and no principle remained in the
German confitation, ofrfuLfficient force to main-
tain public order, and hardly to ascertain per-
fonal s~ecurity; From the accession of Rodulph
of Habfb~urgh, to the reign of Miaximilian , the
immediate predeeifor of' Charles V. , the empire
felt every calamity which a state must endure,
when the- authority of government is to mue~ch
relaxed as to have 10frall vigour. The causes-
of diflenfion among that vast number of" members,
which com~posed the Germanic body, were in-
finite and unavoidable. Ther'e gave rife to per-
petual private wars, carried on with all the
violence of refeatme~t , when unreffrained by
superior atuthority·. Ra pine, outrage, exacftions,
became univers~al. Commerce was interrupted;
induffryj thflpended; and every part of Germany
resembled a country which an enemly had plun-
derled and laid desolate 1). The variety of ex-
pedients employed with a view to reff ore order
and tranquillity, prove that the grievances occa.

honed by this Riate of anarchy had gr~own into-
lerable. Arbiters were a~ppointed -to termninate
the differ~ences among- the several itates. The
cities united in a league , the objeat of which
was to check the rapine and extortions of the
nobility. The nobility formed confederaies,
on purpose to maintain tranquillity among their
own order. Germany was divided into several
circles, inz each of which a provincial and partial
jurifdi~tion was eftablithed, to iipply the place
of a public and common tribunal m).

Particularly by the infitiation of the Imperial Chamiber.

But all these remedies were so fr~uitles~s,

that they served only to demonstrate the violence
ofthat anarchy which prevt~iled, and the inefficacy
of the means employed to corredt it. At length
Mlaximilian rees~tablished purblic order in the
empire, by inftitutiyg the Imperial Chamber,
(A.D. I495.) a tribunal composed of judges named
partly by- the emperor, partly -by the several
sl~ates, and velled with authority to decide
finally concerning all differences among the
members of the Germanic body. A few years
gfter, by giving a new form to the Aulic coun-
ibil, which takes cognizance of all feudal causes,
and such as belong to the emperor's immediate
jurifdi~tion , he rest~ored some degree of vigour
to the Imperial authority.

At th~e beginning of the sixteenth century , the empire an affo-

ciation of forereign states.

But notwithstanding the fa~latary effe~ts oif

these regulations and improvements, the politi-
cal conflitution of the German empire, at the'
comlmencem-ent of the period of which I prodpoile
to write the history, was of a species tro pecre-
l2iar, as not to ref'emble perfe~tly any form of
government kEnown either in the ancient or mo-
dern world. It was a compylet: body, formed
by the association of several slates , each of
which poffeffed~ sovereign and.independent juric-
di~iotn wJithin its obwn territor-ies. Of all the
members which cormpofbd this unired body, the
emperor was the head. In his name, aj' de-
crees and regrulations, with refpe& to points of
common concern, were issued; and to himn thie
power of carrying them into execution was
committed. But this appearance of m~onar chi--
cal power in the emperor was more than coun-
terbalanlced by the influence of the princes and
states of the empire in every· act of adminiftra-
tion, Nio law extending to the whole body
couzld pas~s, no resolution that affe~ed the ge-
neral interest could be taken, without thie ap--
probation of the diet of the empire. In this
ai~emnbly, every sovereign prince and state of
the Germanic body had a right to be present,
to deliberate, and to vote. The decrees or
Recess~es of the diet were the laws of the em-

pire, w~hich the emperor was bound to ratify
and enforce.

`PeclUharties in thre natUre of this associ~ation.

Under this afpe&t, the constitution of the

emnpire, appears a regulat' confederacy, Similar to
t~he Achaean leag-ue in ancienit Greece, or to that
of the U~n'ited Provinces and of the Swit~s cantonis in
modern times. But if viewed in another light,
firik~ing peculiarrities in its political state present
themfielves. The Germanic body was not fourm
ed by the unioan of members altogether dift-
Iint and independe~nt. All the princes and
slates, joined in this afflociation, were origi-
nally f~ubjeat, to the emperors, and aknowledged
them as sovereigns. Besides tihis, they origi-
nally held their lands as Imperial fiefs, and in
consequence of this tenure owed the emperors
all~ thoafe services which feudal vaifals are bound.
to perform to their liege lord. But though this
political f~ubje&ion was entirely at an end, and
the influence of the feurdal relation much dimi-·
nif~hed , the anlcient forms and institutions , in-
troduced while the emrperors governed Germa-
ny with authority not inferior to that which
the other monarchs of Europe poffeiTed ,
if ill remained. Thus an oppolition was eftab-
.lifhed 'between the genius of the g~overn~ment:
andl the formls of adminifkration in the G~erman

I empire. The former considered the emperor

only as the head of a. confederacyt the· mem-

bers of which, by their voluntary choice, have
raised him to that dignity; the latter seemed
to imply, that he is really inverted with fo~ve-
reign power.

The defeas in the conkitution of the empire.

By this circumfiance, fach principles of her.

tility and dis~cord were interwoven in the frame
-of the Germanic body, as affe~ted each of its
members, rendering their interior union incom-
plete, and their external efforts feeble and irre-
gular. The effekts of this vice or disorder in-
herent in the conititution of the empire are to
considerable, that, without attending to them
it is impossible to comprehend many tranfa~tions
in the reign of Charles V. , or to form just
ideas concerning the genius of the German go-
vernment.

Arising from the limited powfer of the emperors.

The emperors of Germany, at the begin-

ning of the sixteenth century, were diftingruitsr~
ed by the moR pompous titles, and by such en-
signs of dignity, as intimated their authIority to
be superior to that of all other monarchs. The
.greatest princes of the empire attended, and f'er-
ved them, on some occaflons, as the officers
of their household. They exercif'ed prerogati-
ves which no other forereign ever claimed.
They retained pretensions to all the extensive
powers which their predecessors had enjoyed in
any former age. But, at the fame time, instead

Qs

of poi~effiing that ample domoain· which had bej
Jonged to the ancient emperors of Germany,
and which stretched from Basil 'to Cologne,
along both banks of the Rhine, n) they wuere
£tript of all territorial property , and had not a
single city, a single castl!e, a single foot of land
that per'tained to them, as heads of the empire.
Alks ·their dona~in was alienated,. their Rated re-
vremies were reduced almaft to nothing; and
the extraordinary aids , which on a few occa-
lions they obtained, were granted sparingly,
and paid writh relutance. The pri~nces an~d
tates of the empire, though they seemed to re-
cognize the Imperial authority, were futbjeAs
·only. in name, each of thiem poeflfling a com-
plete mlunicipal jurisdi~ion within the precinlis
Sos his own3 territories.

·fi~rom the nature of their titles and pretentions.

From this ill -compeded frame of govern-

anent , effe~ts that: were unavoidable, resulted.
The emperors, dazzled wlith the splendor of
their titles , and the exterior signs of vast au-
thority , were apt to imagine themnfelves to
be the real fovereignIs of Geranany, and w~ere
led to aim continually at recovering the exer-
cife of those powers which the forms of the
confituttion seemed to test in them~, and wvhich
th~eir predecefrors, Charlemagne and the Othos,
had adually enjoyed. The princes and RatesE

.)5) Pfeif~ei Abreg4, &c. p. E4I,

awart·e of t'he nature as wr~ell as exte~nt of their
pretensions, were perpetually on their guard,
in order to watch all the motions of the Imrpe-
ri-al courrt, and to circumferibe its pow~ere within
imnits Ptill more narrowT. The emperors, in
s~upport of their claims , appealed to ancient
foirms tand inftitutionls, wthich thie Rates held to
be obsolete. TShe ~Rates fournded their rig~hts-on
recent pradhice and modern privileges, which f
the emperors considered as ufurpations.

F;·ro the mranner in whiich th3ey nere eleaed.

This jealousy of the imperial authority ,

together with the opposition between it and the
rights of the states, increased conflderably from
the time that the emperors, were ele~ted , not:
by the colle~tive body of German nobles, bt~t
by a few princes of chief dignity. During a
long period , all the members of the Germanic
body affiemobled, and made: choice of the person
whom they appointed to be their head. But
amidRt the violence and anarchy which prevailed
for several centuries in the empire, freven prin-
ces who poireied the most ex tensive territories,
and who had obtained a hereditary title to the
great offices of the Rcate, acquired the exclusive
privilege of nominating the emperor. This right
was confirmed to them by the Golden Bull ;
·the mode of exercising it was as~certained, and
they were dignified with the appellation of
Eledorsc. The nobility and free cities being thus

Itripped of a paiirilege which they had once en-
joyed , were less conneaed with a prince, to-
wards whose elevration they had not contributed
by their fuffrages, and came tq be more ap-

, prehenfive of his authority. The ele~tors, by

their extensive power, and~ the diftinguithing
privileges which they poffeffed, became formid-
able to the emperors, with whom they were
placed alm<;rt on a level in s~everal a~ts of' jurif-
di~tionl. Thus the introdu~tion of the eledtoral
college into the empire, and the authoirit which
it acquired, instead of diminishing·, contributed
to strengthen, the principles of hoffility and
dis~cord in the Germanic confllitation.

From the ,di~fferent forms of government ektablifhied in the ilates

which compoCe-d the Germanic body.

Thes~e were further augmented by the various

and repugnant forms of civil policy in the several
states which composed the Germanic body. It
is no eafyT matter to render the union of inde-
pendent slates perfem and entire, even when the
genius and forms of their ref~pedive governments
happen to be altogether similar. But in the
German empire, which was a. confederacy of
princes, of eccle~fiall~ics, and of free cities, it
was impossible that they could incorporate tho-
roughly. The free cities were fmnall republics,
in which the maxims and spirit peculiar to that
species of government prevailed. The princes
apd nobles, to whom s~upreme jurifdiftion be-

Jonged, poffeffed a fort of monarchical power
wvithin their ow~n territori~es, and the forms of'
their interior adminiffrationi nearly resembled
those of the great feudal: kingdoms. The inter-
eft, the ideas, the objets of states to differen~tily
cons~tituted , cannot be the fame. Nor could
their common delibera-tions be carried on with
the fame spirit, while the love of liberty,- and
attention to commerce, were the reigning prin-
ciples in the cities; while the desire of power,
and ardour for military glory, were the go-
verning paffrons of the princes and nobility.

From theQ oppFoftion 'betwleen the fecurlar and ecclesiastical

members.

The secular and ecclefiafftical members of

the empire were as little litted for union as the
free cities and the nobility. Vast territories
had been granted to several of the German
bifnlopricks and abbeys, and some of the highest
offices in the empire having been annexed to
them inalienably, were held by the ecclefiafties
raised to these dignities. The younger sons of
noblemen of the second order, who had devoted
bhemfelves to the church, were commnonly pro-
moted to thes~e R~ations of eminence and power;
and it was no fimall mortification to the princes
and great nobility , to fee persons raised from an
inferior rank to the fame level wtith themselves,
or even exalted to s~up~erior dignity. The eda-
cation of thef'e churchm~en, the genius of their

profefflon, and theiri conne~tion with the court
of Rome, rendered their· charafter as well' as
r'thereft diflfe~rent fr~om those of the other members
of the Germanic body; with whom they were
called to a4& in conc~ert. Thus ano~ther fousrce
of jealodfy and variance was opened, which·
ought note to be overlook~ed when wve are s~earch-
jing into the nature of the German confti-
tutiop.

From the unlequal. diiaribution of wealth and power amrong the

me mb ers .

To all there cadfes of diffenflon may be-

added one more, azrifing from the unequal difl-
tribution of power and wealth among the states
of the empire. The ele~tors, and other nobles
of the highest rank, not: only poffeffed foverpignI
jurifdi~t~ion, but governed s~uch extensive, po..

\ pulo-us, and r·ich coun~ties, as rendered them

great p~'rinces. Many of the otht~er members ,
though they en~jo~yed ail the rights of fovereigntyv,
ruled over fisch petty domains , that their real
power bore no proportiori to this highu prerogra-
tive. .A well-ompa~ted and vigorouxs confe-
deracy coult not be formed of fach dillimilar
ftaites. The weaker were jealous, timid, and
unable either to assert or to defend their just
privilegres. ~The more powerful were apt to as-
fume and to become oppref~ive. The eleftors
-and emperors, by turns, endeavoured to extend
their own -authiority, by encroaching on the

righ~ts of those feeble memnb;er~s of the Germranic
body; and th~ey, overawed or corru-pted, tamely
s~urrendered their privileg-es, or 2neanly fvoured
th~e d~efgns ~formed againR them TT).

Aillth~ererender the Germani;ic body incatpable of ating- with

union and vigour.

After contemplating all these principles of

dis~union and opposition in the constitution of
the Gesrman empire, it will be eafyr to account:
for the want of concord and uniformity, con-
fpicuous in its councils and proceedings. That
flow, dilatory, diftrufiful, and irresolute [pirit,
whi·Ech ch~araf'terizes all its delibferations, wvill
appear natural in a body, the junLtion ofwhofe
maembersr was ~so in complete, the different parts
of whichr were held together b~y faxch feeble ties,
and set at variance by such powerful motives.
But the empire of Germany,~ nevertheles~s, com-
prehended countries of s~uch vast extent, and
wvras inhabited by fuzch a marrial and hardy race
of men, that whTEen the abilities of an empiieror,
or'zeal for any common canf~e could rouze-t~his
unwfieldy bbdy to put forth its firenght , it aftd
with irresistible force. In thie following hifftory
we £h~all find, that as the meafuzres onz wh~lich

and diviflo~n peculiar to the G-ermanic cojnftituz-

View &6t the Turkilih g~overnment,

The Turkis~h hillory is fb blended, during

the reign of Charles V., with that of the great
nations' in Europe, and the Ottomnan Porte in-
terpodfed t~o often ; and with thrch decisive- in-
fluence in the wars and negociations of the
Chrlitian princes, that some previous account
of the Rtate of government in that greazt em-
pire, is no lefse necea~ary for the information
of my readers, than these views of the confti-
tution of other kingdoms which I have already
exhibiited to them,.

Its origin.

It has been the fate of the so~uthern lnd-

more fer~tile parts of Asia, at different periods,
to be conquered by that warlike and hardy ra-
ce of men, who inhabit the vast country known
Sto the ancients by the name of Scythia, and
among the moderns by that of Tartary. One
tribe of there people, called .Turks or Turco-
mans, extended its conquests, under various
leaders, and -during several. centuries, from the
thore of the Caspian to the Straits of the Dar-

danell es. Towards the middle of the ~fifteenth
century, therie formidable conquerors took Con-
ft~antinop~le by fkorm, and established the f'eat
of their government in that imperial city. Greece,
Moldavia , Walachia, a nd the other provin-
ces of the ancienlt.king~doms of Thrace and
M~acedonia, together with part of HungaryT,
were faubje2ed to their power.

Its; despo~tic genius.

But though the feat of the Turkith govern-

ment was fixed in Europe, and the sultans
obtained poffefion offutch extenfxve dominions
in that quarter of the globe, the g~enius of
their policy was purely Afxatic ; and may be
properly termed a des~potism., in contradiftination
to those monarchical and republican forms of
government which we have been hitherto co~n-
templating. The futpreme power was vefied
in sultans of the Ottoman race, that blood being
deemed to sacred, that no other was thoughIt
worthy7 of the throne. From this elevation,
thes~e f'overeigns could look down and LBebold
a'll their fuzbjeats reduced to the fame level be-
fore th em. The maxims of Turkish policy
admit not any of those institutions, which, in
other countries, limit the exrercife, or mode-
rate the r-igour of monarchical powyer: no great
court with conirtitutional and permanent jurif-
diia~lo to interpore, both in enading lawTs,
and in executing them: no body of hereditary

noblesr, whafe fents of their owrn pre-eminence,
whose confelodnieifs of what is duae to their
rank and thata~er, \vhofe Julfoury of their pri-
vilelges circumforibe the aurthority of the prince,
an'd serve not only as a batrrier against the
excesses of his caprice, but stand as an inter-·
mediate· order betw~een him and the people. Un-
der the Turkish government, the political con-
dition of every faubjea is e~qua. To be em-
ployed in the service of the furltan, is the only
circumffance ~tha~t confers diftinalon,, Even
this diftintion is annexed t~o closely to the
flatiohs in whis-h persons s~erve, tha~t it is fecar-
cely communicated to those who are placed in
the~m. The highest dignity in the empire does
not give a~ny rank or pre-eminence to the fami-
ly of himn who ·enjoys it. As every man, be-
fore he is raised to any s~tation of authority ,
must go through the preparatory diifcipline of a
lonig and s~ervile obediience, o) the moment he.
is deprived. of power, he and his posterity re-
turnL to the f~ame condition with other faubje~ts,
and fink back into obs~curity. It is the diftin-
guit~hing and odious charadteriffick of Eastern
defprotife, that it annihilates all other ranks
of men, i~n.order to exalt the monarch; that: it
leaves nothing to the former, while it g~ives
evefy thing to the latter ; that it endeavours

every des~pot, to. maintain his authority, and
to execute his commzands. Als the Turks ex-
Vended their empire over nations which they
did not exterminate, but reduce to fubje~tion,
they found it necessary to render their military
-establishment numerous and formidable.

O~rigin of the Jlanizaries,

Amerath, their third Sultan, (A. D. 2 362.)

in order to form a body of devoted troops, that
might serve as the ·immediate guards of his
person and dignity, appointed his o~fficers to
fecize annually, as the Imperial pioperty, the
lfifth part of the youzth _taken in war. There,
after being~ in~truded i~n the 1Hlahom~etan reli-
gion, inured to obedience by fievere dis~cipline,
and. traine~d to warlike exercises, were fosrmed
into a body diftinguithed by the name -of Jani-
zar~ies, or new soldiers. Every f~entimnent which~
enthufisfm can inspire, every mark of difT-
tin~tion that the favour of the prince could
confer, were employed in order to animate this
body with mar tial ardour, and with a con-
friouf~nefs of its own pre-eminence. q) The
Janizarjies s~oon became the chief firength and

Thus, as the s~upreme power in every foi-

diety is poff~effed by :those who have arms in
their hands , this formidable body of soldiers ,
destined to be the infiruments of enlarging th&
Sultan's authority, acqulired, at the Ajme time,
t~he means of controuiling it. The Janizaries
in Conflantinople , like the Praetorian bands in
ancent Rome, quickly perceived all the advan-
tages which they derived from being flationed
in thae capital ; from 'their union under one
Randard; and from 'being maiters of the person
of the prince. T'he Sultans became no lefh fen-
flible of their influence and importance. :The
Capicilly, or soldiery of the Port, was the only
power in the empire that a Sultan or htis vifier
had reason to dread. To preserve the fidelity
and attachment of the Janizaries, was the great
art of government, and the principal objet% of
attention in the policy of the Ottoman court;

A remarkable c-ondrmation of both parts of

this reasoning occurs in the hiffory of England.
The Saxons carried on the conquei2 of that coun-
try with the iame deftwa~tive spirit which difrtin--
guithed thie-other batbar~ous nation~s. The .ancient
inhabitants of Britain were eith-er exterannated,
or forced to take ~Chelter among the mountains
of Wales, or reduced into servitude. TThe Saxon
government, laws, manners, and language were
of consequence introduced into Britain; and were:
to perfeatly efb-ablifhed, that all memory of the
institutions previous to thieir conquest was abo-
lithed. The very reverse of this happened in
a s~ubsequent revolution. A iingle viaory placed
W~illia-m the Norman on the throne of England.
The Saxon inhabitants, though opprefied, were
not exterminated. Wililiam- employed the utmost
efforts of his power and policy to make his new
Thbje~tsconformn in every thing to the Norman
.handard; but without succes~s. The Saxons,
though vanquis~hed, were far more numerous
than their conquero~rs; when the two races began
to incorporate, .the Saxon laws and manners
gradually gained ground. The Norman inftitu-
tions were unpopular and odious; many of them
fellI into ditate 4 and in the English constitution

and language, at this day, many essential parts
are manifekl~y of Saxon, not of N~Porman exetract.

the Roman provinces; the inhabitants had been
diffinguifhed for courage, and had defended

the moR fertile of t~he Roman provinces. It

was one of the granaries of the empire, and is

common wealth. Th~ough the army w-ith which
the Vandals invaded it, did not exceed c30,000
fighting men, they became abfo'lute mast~ers of
the province in less than two years. A con-
temporaryv author gives a dreadfull account: of
the havock which they made: ,, They found a
provFince well cultivated , and enjoying plenty,
the beauty of the whole earth. They carried
their deffrudive arms into every corner of it;
they difpeopled it by their devaffations; exter-
mlinating every· thing with fire an~d sw~-ord. They
did not even spare the vines and frui - trees,
that those, to w-hom caves and inacceflible
mountain s had afford ed ·a retreat, niight find
no nourit~ihment of any kind~. Their hostile rage
could not be fa~tiazted , and there wa~s no
place exempted from the effects of it. They
tortured their priforlers with the most exq~uriite
cruelty, that they might force from them a dit-
covery of their hidden treafar:es. The more
th ey difoovered, the more th ey Yexp ed , and
the more implacable they b~ecazme. N~~Lter the
infirmities of age nor of sex ; n either the dig-
nity of nobility, nor the sanc~tity of the f~acer-

~The state of -deifolation in other countries of
Europe se~ems to have been th fme In many·
los the mloft early charters now extant, tihe lands
granted to monasteries, or to private perfon~rs,
are ditijngutilhed into s~uch as are cultivated or
inhabited, and s~uch as w~ere :eremi, desolate.
In many instances, lands are granted to perfonas
becaus~e they had taken them from the desert,
ab eremo, and had cultivated and planted them
with in~ha~bitant~s. This appears from a charter
of Charlemagne, punblifh;ed by Eckhart de Rebuis
Francise Orientalis, vol. ii. p. 864, and from
many charters of his facceff~ors, quotedi by Du
Cang~e voc. Eremus. --- W~herever a rig·ht of
property in land can be thus acquired, it is
evident that the country muff he ex;tremely de-
solate, and thinly peopled. The first settlers in
America obtained poffieffron of land by sauch a
title. WdJhoever was able to clear and to cu!l-
tivaLte a fLield, was recognized as the giroprietor.
His induffry merited s~uch a recompence. The
grants in the charters w~hich I have mentioned
flow from a similar principle, an a the~re must

I arn fenible, not only that: fame of th~ese

defecriptions of the devaeations , which I have
qjuoted, may be 'exaggerat~ed, but that the bar-
barous tribes , in making their f ettlements, did
not proceed invariably in the fame manner.
Some of then se~emed to be ben~t on exterminat-i
ing the an~cient inhabitants; others were more
difpefed to incorporate with them. It: is not:
my province either to enquire into the causes
which occasioned this v~ariety in the condua tof
the conquerors, or to d~eferibe the Rate of those
countries where the an~cient inhabitants were
treated moit mildly. The haas -which I have
produced are fai-l~icient to prove, that the defe
tru~tion of the human Sp~ecies, occaftoned by
the hostile invaxaions of the north~ern nations,
and their fubfiequent settlements , was much
greater than many authors seem to imagmne.

I have observed , N~ote II., that our only

certain information concerning the ancient Rtate
of the barbarous nations mnuff he derived fro~m
the Greek and Roman writers. H-appily an
ac~count of the inRitutiosns and cuitomns of one
people, to which those of all the reft f~eemn to
hrave been: in a great meafutre limilar, has been
tsrnfinitted to us by two authors , the moit

ca~pable, perhap~s, that ever wrote, of obfery-
ing them withn profonud discernment , and of
dleferibing them with propriety and force. The
reader mast perceive that I have Caesar and
Tacitus in my eye. The former gives a thort
account of the ancient Germans in a few chapters
of the sixth book~~ f his Commentaries : Th~e
latter wrote a treatlife expres~sly on that subjec~t.
Th~ese are the most precious and inftrautive
mnonurments of antiquity to the prefient inhabi-
tants of Europe. From them we learn,

i. That the state of society among the an-

cient Germans was of the rudest and most simple
form. They faiblfted entirely by hunting or
by parturage. Caef. lib. vi. c. 2I. They neg-
le~ted agricultuzre, and lived chiefly on· mrilk,
cheef~ie, and flesh. Ibid. e. 22. Tacitus agrees
-with· him in mos~t of thef~ie points ; De morib.
G~ermr. c. 14, 15- 23. The Goths were equal-
ly negligent of agriculture. Prifec. Rhet. ap.

cultivate the earth, or to touch a ploughn. Ammt.

W~hile faciety remains in this simple slate, men
by uniting together fecarcely relinquish any por·-
-tion of their natural independence. Accordingly
we are informed, --- 2. That the authiority of
civil government was extrem~ely limited among
the Ger-mans. During times of peace they had

Sza

no common or fixed magiltrate, but the chief
,men of eveiry diftriat di~spensed juffice, and ac-

commo~dated differences. Caef. ibid. c. 2·3. Their
kings had not abfolate or unbtounded powler:
their authority codifiied rather in the privilege
of advising , than in the pow~er of commanding.
1Vlatters of fmnall cons~equence wcsere determined
b~y the chief men; affairs of importance by the
whole community. Tacit. c. f. I x. The Huns,
in likre manner, deliberatted in comnmon conlcern-i
ing every business of moment to the society;
and wrere not furbjeat to the rigrour of regal au-,
thority. Amm. Malrcel. lib. sxxxi. p. 474- --- 3-
Every individual among the ancient Gelrmans
was left at liberty to chufe w7hether he w~ouldf
take part: in any military enterprize which wras
prop~osed; there seems to have been no obl3ia-
tion to engage in it imposed on him by pubslice
authority. ,, When any of the chief men pro--
poses any expedition, sauch as approve of the
caufb and of the leader rife up , and declare:
their intention of followring him; those , who
do not fulfil this engagement , are confiidered
a~s deeferers and traitors, and. are loolked ·upon
as. infamous. " Caef. ibid. c. 23. Tacitus
Splainly points at the thme cuffom, though in
terms more obscure. Tacit. c. I x. --- 4. As eve-
ry individua~l was so independent, - and maftier
in to great a degree of his own a~tions, it be-
.came, of consequence, the great objeae of evec-
.ry person among the Germans, wrho aimed at

beingr a leader, to g~ain adherents, andi attach·
th~em to his person and interest. There adhe-
rents~ Caesar _calls Ambaffi and Clientes, i.. e.
retainers or clients, Tacitus, Comites, or com-
panions. The chief diftindion and power of
the leaders confilred in being attended by a na-
merous band of chosen youth. This was their
pride as w5ell as ornament during peace, and
their def~ence in w-ar. The lead~ers gained or
preserved the favour of thnefe retainers by pre-
sects of armour and of horses; or by the pro-
fuse though inelegant hos~pitality wyith which
they -entertained them. Tacit. c.- ,1---5
Another confeqilence of the pers~onal liberty and
independence wxhich the Germans retained ,
even after they united in society , was their
circums~cribing~ the criminal jurifi~i~ion of the
magistrate w~ithin very narrow limits, and their
not only claiming but e xercifing almuoft all tb e
rights of private resentment and revenge. Their
magistrates had not the powier either of impri-
foning, or of in~fidting; any corporal punishment
on a freemnan. Tacit. c. 7.* Every person was
-obliged to avenge the wcrongfs whiich his parents
or friends had ~~~i~g~Their enmnities w~ere
hereditaryT, burt not irreconcilwable. Even murder
was comnpenfated by pay~ing a certain number
of cattle. Tac., c. 21. A part of the fine went
to thle king , or state , a part to the pers~on.
w-ho hadc been injured, or to his kindred. Ibid.

Those particulars concerning th~e institutions

and manners of the Germans , though well
known to every person conversa8nt In ancient
litera~ture, I have thought proper to arran~ge in
this order, and to layT before s~uch of my readers
as may be les~s acquainted with there fa~ts, both
because they confirm the account which I have
given of the state of the barbarous nations, and
becaus~e they tend to illuffrate all the obferva-
tions I thall have occaiion ·to make concering
the various changes in their g~overnment and
cuffoms. The lawls and cust~oms introduced byp
the barb~aro~us nations into their new f'ettlemnents,
are the best commentary on the writings of
Caesar and Tacitus; and their observations are
the best key to a perfedt knowledgel of ther~e
la~ws and chfitoms.

O~ne circumffance, with refpedt to the tef-

timonies of Caesar and Tac~itus concerning the
Germans, merits attention. Caesar wrote his
brief account of their ma-nners more than an
hundred years before Tacitus composed his
treatise De mor''~T'~T'~T·~T·~Tibus German~orum. An hun-
dried years make a considerable period in thie
~progress of national manners , especially if , dur-
ing that time, those people who are rude and
unpolithed have had much communication with
mnore civilized Aates. This was the cafe with
the Germans. Their intercours~e with the Ro-
mans begain when Caesa~r crofled the Rhirie ,
and increased prodigiously during the interval

b~etween tha't event and the tim~e when Taecitus
~fl~ouri~fbed. Belizdes th~is, there was a confid~er-
able difference between the stat~e o-f focie-tye
among t-he different trik~es of Germans. Thie
Sulones wTefre so much imrproved, that threy be-
gan to be corrupted. Tpac. caP, $44 The
Fenn~i were so barbtarous, that it is wonderf~ul.
how they were able to fa~brift. Ibid. caP. 46.
Whloever undertakle~s to defersibe the manners
of the Germcans, or to found any political theo-
ry upon the state of society among them, ought
carefully to attend to both there circurnftances.

Before I quit thiis fiubjeBt, it may' not be:

implr-oper to observe , that, though facceffive
alterations in their in-stitutions, together wt~it~h
the gradual progress of refinement, have mad~e
an entire change in the manners of the various
people wFho conquered the Roman empire, there
is ~still one race of men nearly in the ~fame
political. situation with theirs , wehen they first
fettledt in their newr con quests : I mean the val-
rious tribes and nations of Savag~es in North
Armerica. It cannot then be confxidered either
as a digreffron, or as an improper ~imalence
of curiosity , to en quire wh ether this iimilarity
in their political state has occaflone~d any ref~em-
blanse bettiveen their charallter and ma~nners.
If the Hkgenef~s turns ou~t to be striking, it is a
stronger proof that a just account has beeni gi-
ven of the anient inhabitants of Europe, thall
the testimony ev~en of Caesar or of Tacitus.

r. The Americans fiabiff chiiefly by hunting

and fishing. Some tribes negrled agriculture
entirely. Among those who cultivate some
small spot near their huts, that, together wvith
all works of laboour, is performed by the wo-
men. P. C~harlevoix Journal Hifforique d'un
Voyage de P*Anerique 4~to. Par. 1744- P. 334*
In'fugch a itate of society, the common wants of men
beingr few, and their mutual dependence upon
each other small, their unlion is extremely im-
perse6; and they continue to enjoy their natu-
ral liberty almost unimnpaired. It is th~e first
idea of an America~n, that every manl is born-
free and independentc, and that no power on
~earth hath afiy right to diminish or circumferibe
his natural liberty. There is hardly any
appearance of fabordination either in civil or
domeitic government. Every one does what
he pleases, A father and mother with t'heir
children, live likie persons whom chance has
brought together, and wYhomn no common bonfd
unites. Their manner of educating their chil-
dren is faitable to this principle. They never
chastise or punish them, even during~ their in-
fancy. As they advance in years, they allow
them to be entirely masters of their own aRions,
and ref'ponfible to nobody. Id. p. 2/2. 273. ---
2. The power of their civil magiffrates is
.extremely limited. Among most of their tri-
b~es, the Sachem or chief is ele~ive. A ceoun-

cil of old men is chosen to assist him, wiithout-
whof'e advice he determines no affair of im~por-
tance. The Sachems neither· poffers nor claim
any great degree of authority. They propose
and intreat, rather than comr~mand. The obe-
dience of their people is altiogether volurntary.
Id. p. 6 6. 2 6 . --- 3. The fiavages of Ame-
rica engag·e in any military enterprize, not
from constraint, 'but choice. W7hen war is
resolved , a chief arises, and offers himself to
be the lea~der. Such as are willing (for they
compel no perfron) st~and up one after another,
anld sing their wa~r-fou~g. But if, after this,
any of these thoul~d refuse to foll~ow the lead~er
to wh~om they have engagred, his life would
be in danger, and he woculd be considered as
the most infamous of all men. Id. p. 2 x7-
2x 8. --- 4. Such as engage to follow any lea-
der, expeal to be treated by him with great
attention and refpeR; and he is obliged to make
them pref'eats of considerable value. Id. p.

mag~istrate has fearcely any criminal jurif~-
di~tion. Id. p. 1·72. Upon receiving: any
injury , the person or family offended, may
infliat what· punishment they pl-ease on the
person wrho was the author of it. Id. p. 2?s4*
Their refentinent and desire of vengeance are
excefiive and implacable. Time can neither
extinguish7 norr abate it. I~t is the czhief inherit-
ance whichi parents leave to their children ; it is

tranfin~itted from generation to generation, un-
til an ocedzion be found of satis~fying it. Id. p.
309. Somnetimnes,- however, the offended party
-is appeased. A cornpedfation is paid for a
murder that has been committed. The rela-
tions of the deceas~ed receiv~e it; and it cort-
tifts most cbmmonly of a captive taken in war,
wTho being substituted in place of the person
who was murdered, a~ffames his ·name, and is
adopted in~to his family. Id, p. 274. The
refetablance holds in many other particulars.
It is fuufficient for my purpose to have pointed
out the limilarity of those great features which
disting~uish and charafterize both people. Bo-
chart, arid other philologists of the lazft centa-
ry, who, with more eradition than feience,
endeavoured to-,trace the migrations of various
natoios, and who were apt, upon the f'lighteft
aPPenrance of refemnblance, to find an affinity
between nations far removed from each other,
and to c~onclude that they were descended from
the f'ame anceffors, would hardly have failed,
on viewing fach an *amazing similarity, to
pronounce with con~fidence. ,, That the Ger-
mans and Americans must be the fame people. i
But a philosopher will iftisfy himself with ob-
fTerving. ,, That* the chara~ters of nations de-
pend- on the Rtate of society in which th~ey live,
and on the political institutions establis~hed
among themn; and that the hannan mind, when-
lever it is placed in the fame situation, will,

in ages the most diftanmt, and in countries the
soft remote, affame the fame form, and be
diftingulfhed'~~''~ie by the fame manners. "

I hav7e pushed the comnparifon between the

rGermans and Americans no farther than was
n~ecessary for the ~illuffra~tion of my ~ubje~t. I
do not pretend that: the state of faciety in the
two countries w~as perfe&1ly similar. MVany of
the German tri'bes were more civ~ilized than the
Americans. Some of them wtere not un acquxaint-
ed with agriculture ; almost all of them had
flocks of tame cattle, and depended for the chief
part of their fublfifence upon there. Most of
tfhe American tribes s~ubsist by hunting, and are
in a ruder and more iimple state than the an-
cient Germans.. The resemblance, how~e.ver,
betwreen their condition , is greater , peirhaps ,
than any that hifftory affords an opportunity of
observing between twro races of un-civilized na-
tions, and this has produced a, furprizing frmi-
larity of manners.

The booty gained by an army belonged to

the army. The king himfielf had no part of it
but what he acquired by lot. A remarkable
ins hance of this occurs in the hiss ory of the Franks.
The army of Clovis, the founder of the French
monarchy, having plundered a church, carried
off , among other ~sacred utensils , a vase of ex-

traordinary size and bDeauty. The bifhiop sent
deputies to Clovis, b~eseeching himl to restore
the vas~e, that it: might be agrain employed in
the Tacred services to wrhich it had been confe-
c~ra~ted. Clovis desired the deputies to follow
him to Soiaons, as the booty wlas to be divid-
ed in that place , and promhifed, that if the
l2ot tChould give him the dis~po~sal of th~e vase,
he would granzt what thie bi-hop desired.
WP~hen he came to Soiirons, and all the boooty
was placed in one great heap in th~e middle of
the armyv, Clovis entreated, that before making
the! divilion, they would give him that vase
over and above his share. All appeared wililing
to gratify the king, and to complyr wit7 hiis re-
queftj when a fierce and haughty s~oldier lif--
te~d up his battle -axe, and ftrikingr the vase
wXith th~e utmost violence, cried out with a loud
voice, ,, You t'hall receive nothting here but
that to which the lot gives you a rig-ht. " Gre-

The hiffory of the eftablifhmeent and pro-

grrefsl of the feudal system, i arn interesting ob-
jeBt to all the nations of Europe. In forne coun-
'tries , th~eir jurisprudence and laws are fitil in1
a great meaFarre feudal. In others, many forms
and prac??ces effablifhed by cufforn, or foundedl

on statut~es, tootk their rife~ from the feudalt law,
and cannot be underftoord without atten~ditor to
the ideas peculiar to it. Several autho~crs of the
highest reputation for genius anTd erudition, havTe
endeavoured to i~ll-frate th-is fubjie~, bu~t-t
th~ey have left: manyF p~arts of it obscure. I fball
endeavour tor trace, with precision, the pr~o-
grefs and variation of ideas concerning property
in -land among the barbarojus nations; andlC sh~all
attempt to point out the causes wthich in trod uc-
ed there changes, as wtiell as thie efe~~rs wh~-ich
followfed upo-n them. PropertyT in land see~ms
;to hZavTe gone thirough four successive changes
amlong the people who fettle~d in the v·arious
previnces of "the Romian empire.

I. Pt'hile the barbarouns nations rem~ained in

thIeir original -countries , their propertyi in lanld
was only tempo~rary, and thfeyj had no certain
limits to their poaeffons. After feeding their
flocks in one diftria~, they7 removed w~ith thtem.
their wriv~es and fkrmilies, to ano~ther; and aban-
doned that likewrif~e in a sno~rt time. They w-ere
not, in consequen~ce of this imperfeftfp ~cies of
propertyi, broughJt unider anyr positive or Serm~-al
obligation to s~erve ~th e cormlmuity; all th eir ser-,
vices were purely voluntary. Every indiv-idutl
wTas at liberty to chure how fkr he woulrnd c~on-
tribute towardss carryring on any militaryi enter-
orize. If h~e fo~llowed a leader in any expedi-
tion ,it wfas from attachment, not fromn a f~edie
of oblig~ation. The clareft prorof of this has

been ·produced in Note VL. While property
Continiued in this Rtate, we can discover nothing
that bears any refemblfance to a feudal tenure,

\ or the faboardination and military ser vice which

the feudal system introduced.

II. Upon fettling in the countries whichr

they had fiibdued, the vi~torious troops divided
the conquered lands. Whatever portion of them
fell to a soldier, he fb~ized as the recompence
due to his valour, as a s~ettlement acquired by~
his own fTword.~ He-~ took poirellion of it as a
freemnan in full property. H~e en joyed it during
his own life , and could dispose of it at pleas~ure,
or tranfmnit it as an in~heritane to his children.
Thus property in land became ~fixed. It was
at· the fame time alledial, i. e. the poire~ior had
the entire right of property and dominion; he
held of no feveretign or su~perior lord: to whom
·he was bound to do homage, and perform ser-
vice. But as there ne wproprietors were in some
danger (as has been oblerved in the text) of

r being disturbed by the remainder of the ancient

inhabitants, and in still greater danger of being
attacked by fuccefilve colonies of barbarians as
fierce and rapacious as themselves, they falw
the neceility of coming under obligations to de-
feud the community, more explicit than those
to which they had xbeen fubje& in their original
habitations. On this account, immediately upon
their fixing in their new settlements, every'
freemaiz became bound to ta~ke arms in defence

of the commI3unity , and, if he refused or neg-
le~ed Co to do, was iable to a canfiderable
penalty. I do not mnean that any contrat of
this kind w;as formally con3cluded, or mutuaall
rati~tled by any legal solemnity. It was ·efa-
blifhed by tacit conf~ient, like the other compads~
which hold society together. Their mutual fe;
scurity and preservation made it the interest of
all to recognize its authority, and to enforce
thle obf~iervation of it. W~e can trace back thiis
new obligation on the propir~ietors of land to a
very early period in the hifkory of the ~Fratnks.

fiefs merely during life, and fiefs hereditary to

their first forma, and were held only during plea-

the Dominifum or prerogative of superior lord,

wrhen they became her~editary , although feudal
lawyers continued to define a b~eneficium agree-

in effea takren out of the hands of the s~uperior
lord~s; and lodged in those of the vassal. As

In tracing there various revolutions of pro-

perty , I have hitherto chiefly confined myself
to what h~appened in France, because the anz-
cienmt mnonu~ments of that nation have either been
more carefully pres~erved, or have b~een more

Clearly illutr~ated than thoke of aniy people iq
Eu~rope.

In Italy, the fame revolutions happened

in property, and fireceeded each ·other in the
fiame orde~r. Trhere is some ground , howeJver,
for :conje£tuing, 'thJat alledial property conti
nued f~onge"r' n eftimnation among3 the Italians,
than among the French. It appears, that manyp

which pre~vailed among the great proprietors of
lands, and to various their opportunities of op-
pressing those who were fettled on their estates,
an~d of rendering their con~dition intoletable, that
many freemnen , in despair , renouznced their
libertyV, and voluntarily s~urrendered themselves
as slaves to their powrerful makters. This they
did, n ~order that their maters might become
more immediately interefied to afford them pro-
tedtion, together with the means of fhbfifting
themselves and their families. The forms of'
Arzcht a surrende~r, or obnoxuatio, as it was then
_called, are preserved by Marculfus, lib.ii. c. a8;
and by the anonymous author pubflfhed by IVL
Bignon w·tjogether with the colleftion offormulser
compiled by Miarculfas, c. I6. In both, the
reason given for the obnoxatio, Is the wretched
and indigent condition of the person wfho gives
'Lg) his liberty. It lyas [till more common for

freemen to surrender their liberty to bis~hops or
abbots, that they might partake of the security
which the vaffazls ~and slaves of church~es -and
monuferies enjoyed, in cons~equence of the

All the re~lig-ious m~ax~ims and prla~"L;es ofC

duce one remarkable teitimony in confirmation
of it, from an author canonized by the church
of Rome , St. Eloy or E~gidius , bis hop of Nio-
yon, in the seventh century. ,,He is a good
Christian who comes frequently to church; who
prefeats the oblation which Is offered to God
upon ·the altart; who doth n~ot takze of th~e fruits
of -his own induffy until he has consecrated a

It is no inconsiderable ?misfortune toth

church of R~oime, whose domtrine of Infallibility
renders all sauch inftitfutions and ceremonies as
have been once universally received , immnut-
ab!e and everlasting, that thie rmuft continue to

sbferve, -in enlightened tim~es, Ith~ofie rites which
were introduced duzring the ages of darknefis

sMany of there rites appear mnaifeftly to have

every cir-cumst~anc~e that tendis to explain or to

tacked there trounblefome neigbours, and dif-
pofl'e~Fing them, annexed their territories to the

are extremely favourable to liberty, as they vest
the power of proportioning the taxes in a cer-

ty of property was one great obje&t of those who
inst~ituted communities, we learn, not only from
the nature of the thing·, but from the expres~s
w·ords of s~everal charters, of w~ihich I frall only·
mention that granted by Alienor Queen of Eng-
land and Duches~s of Guxienne, to the cozmma-
nity of Poitiers, ,, ut foa propria melins defen-
4ere pollint, & magis integre cuftodire. " Du
Cange voc. communia, v. ii. p. 863. Such are
some of the capcital regulations es~tabli~shed in
communities during the tw~elfth and0 thirteenth
centulries. These may be coniidered as the first
rudimlents of l~aw and order, and contrilbute~d
greatly to introduce regular government among
all the members of society. As soon as com-

mnit~iies; w~re inst~ituted, hih -sentiments of

the inhnabitants an oath of iidelity to himself and

ler, who began his reign A. D). 920, must be
considered as the great founder of cities in Ger-

by the incurflons of the Hungarians and other
barbarous people. In order to oppose them,
Henry encouraged' his fubjeas to fettle ·in cities
wvhich he surrounded with walls and towers.
He enjoined or perfh~aded a certain proportion
of the nobility to fix their residence in the towns ,
and thus rendered the condition of cjitiing more
honourable than it had been formerly. WCTitti-

civil, in cities. In the eleventh century, many
slaves wJere enfranchired , the greater part o.f

The cities began in the thirteenth century to
form leagues for th~eir mutual defence, and for
reprei~ing· the disorde~rs ocediioned by the pri-
trate wars among the barons, as welli as by

th~eir exario~ns. This rendered the condition

that communities were introduced there in the;

that ~some of the towns in England wxere formed
into corporations under the Saxon Kings, and
that the charters granted by the Kin~gs of the
~Norman race ~etre not charters of enfranchiife-
ment from a state of slavery, but a confirm~ation
of privileges wnhich they already enjoyed. See
Lord Ly-ttelton's Hiffory· of Henmry II. vol. ii..

very inconsiderable in the twelfth cer tury. A
clear proof of this occurs inl the hiffory to
which I last referred. Fitz~itephien, acontem-.
porary aurthor, gives a defeription of the city
of London in the reign of Henry IL. and the
terms in which he fpeakis of its trade, its
wealth, and the sp~lendour of its inhabitants,
would sug~gest no inadequate idea of its itate
at present, when it is the greatest and moss

opulent city of Europe. But all ideas of grani-
deur and magnificence are merely comparative.
It -appears from PzetePr of Blois, archdeacon of
London, who flouriflied in the fEame reign,
and who had good opportunity of being well
informed, that this city, of which Fitzfteph~en
gives fach a pompous account, contained no
more than forty thonfand inhabitants. Ibid.

proportion, and itx no condition to-extort any
extensive privileges. That the constitution of
the boroughs in Scotland, in many circumfran-

Great Britain coulld hardlry address himself to

·a striking instance of the progres~s which the
principles of liberty had made in that kingdom,
gnd of the infl~uence which the deputies of
towvns had. acqrrired in the States General.
During the calamities in which the war with
~England, and the captivity of King John, had
invo6lved France, the States General made a
hold effort to extend their own privileges and

juridiaon.The regulations eft~ablifhiedl by

the States, held A. D. x355, concerning the
mode of levying taxes, the adminiffration of
w~hich they veited not in the crown, but in
comrmiffioners appointed by the States ; concern-
ing the coining of mooney; concerning the re-
dress of the grievance of purveyance;3 concerning
the regular .administration of justice; are much
more .fauitable to the genius of a republican go-
vernment than that of a feudal monarchy. T~his
curious fatatte is publithed, Ordon. ·tiii. p.

vations fCubverfive of the cons~titution and go-

been the cafe, but thef~ie men poffeiied the confi-
dence of the people; and the meas~ures wh·ich
they proposed as the moi popu at and accep-
able, plainly prove that the fp'irit of liberty
had spread wconderfully, and that the ideas
w~hich then prevailed in France concerning
government were extrelmely liberal. The Sta-

I., Among the ancient Germans , as well as other
nations in a similar Rtate of society, the righFt:
of avenging injuries was a private and perfbnal
right, exercised by force of arms, without any
reference to an umpire, or any appeal to a ma-
giffrate ~for decision. The clearest proofs ofthis9
were produced, Note VI.~ 2. This pradfice s~ub-
sifted among the barb~arous nations after their
Eettlemnent in the provinces of the Empire which
they colnquered; and as the causes of dissention
among them multiplied, their family feuds and
private w~ars became more frequent. ,Proofs of

foulnded on the maxim of the ancient Germans,
,, fufcipere tamn inimicitias feu patris, fee pro-
pinqui, quamn amnicitias, neceffeefr;,, a maxim
natural to all rad6 and limple nations, among
which the formn of society, and political union,
strengthen such a feotiment. The method of
af~certainingr the degree of affinity which obliged
a perfor to takre part in the quarrel of a k-idfman,
was curious. Wh~file the ch-urch prohibited the
marridge of perih~ns wlthfin th~e fe8enth degree

As fboom therefore , as thie feudal tenures were

Private wars were very frequent for rCeveral cen-
turies. Nothing contributed more to increase
thos~e disorders in g~overnmnent, or to encourage
thch ferbcity of manners as reduced the n Itions
of Europe to that wretched state wh~ich diftin-
guifhed the period of h~i~ory wlhichn I am review·-
ing. Nothing was f ach an obitacle to the intro-

~- du~tion of a regurlar administration of juffice.

NTothing could more effea~ualy discourage IlddT-
try, or retard the progrers and culltivation 'of
-the arts of p~eace. Private wars were carried
on with all the deffrudtive rage which is to be
dreaded from-s violent res~entment when armed
with forc~e, and aut~horised by ilaw. It appears
from the statutes prohibiting or restraining the
exercise of private heftilities, that the inafx~on
-of the most barbarous enemy, could not be more

~h de-solating to a country, or more fatal to its inha-

bitants, than those inteRtine wars. Or don. tom:.

joining men to cease from their hostilities, and

ic~oncern~ing per~sonal. revsenge, th~e right of pri-

cr~fended, seem to have been much the f~ame
with thos~e which prevailed on the Continent.

;of God and of the Ki-ng , s~eems to be borrowed
·from the Trenrga- or Pax Dei, and~ the Pax Re-

conquest, the mention of private wars among
the nobility occurs more rarely in the English
hiftery, than in -that 9f any other European
nation , and n~ laws concernin'g them are to
.be found in the body' of their statutes. Such
a ch~ange in th~eir 'own manhers, and fach a
·variaition from thos~e 'of their neighbours, is
r~emnarkrable. - Is it to be aicferibted to thie extra-
ordinary power that William the NMorman ac-
quired by right of conquest, and tranfaittedl
to his f~acceefirs, whic-h rend~efed' the execution
-of juffice more vigorous an d deciiive , arnd the
jur~ifdi~t~ionof the King's court more exsteniive
~thani u~i-der the -MVon'archs on the Continent ?
Or, was it owing to thie settlement of the
Normans in E'ngland, who having neveri adopt;-
ed the prdit~e: of private war in their ow4

country, abolished it in the kringdom wihich
they conquered8 It is ai~erted in an ordon~ance
of John King of France, that in all times part,
pers~ons of everyJ rank in Normandy have bee~n
prohibited to wage private war,' and the prac-
tice has been deemed~ unlawful. Ordon. tom.,

go far towards explaining the peculiarity which
I have mnentioned., But as there are som~e
Englifhi~i~iililili~i~i~ A~ts of Parliament, which, according
to the rem~arki of thef earned author of the Ob-
fervations on the Statutes, chiedly the more
ancient, recite falsehoods , it may be- added,
that this is not peculiar to the laws of that
country. Notvithftanding the politive aiear-
tion contained in this publick law of France,
there is good reason for considering it as a £ta-
tute which recites a fals~ehood. This, howu-
ever, is not the place for difculffxg that point.
It is an inquiry not unworthy the curiolity of
an English antiquary.

vate war prevailed, an d was authorized by the

In Germany, the disorders and calamities

occa~floned by the right oaf private war wvere
greater and mo-re intolerable than in any other
country of Euarope. The Imperial authority
was to much thaken and enfeebled by the vrio-
lence of the civil wars, excited by the contests
between the Popes and the Emperors of the
~Franconian and Suabian lines, that not ·only th
nobility but the cities acquired almeft indepen-
dent power , and Scorned aHl fa~tbordination and
obedience to the laws. The frequency of there
faidae, or private wars, are often mentioned in
the German Annals, and the fatal effeas of themn
ar e most pathetica~lly deferibed , Datt. de pace
Imper. pub. lib. i. cap. v. a. 30. & pafinm. The
Germans early adopted the Treuga Dei, which
was first ef~tabliihed in France. Thnis, however,
proved but a temporary and ineffeanal remedy.
The disorders multiplied so faR, and grew so
enormous, that they threatened the diirolution
of faciety, and compelled the Germans to have
recourse to the only remedy of the evil, viz.
an absolute prohibition of private wars. The
Emperor, William, published his edift ~to this
purpose, A. D. 1255, an hundred an~d fxty
years previous to the ordonance of Charles VI.
in France. Datt, lib. i. cap, 4. n. 20. But:
neither he nor his fauccedr~ors had authori~ty to.
ftecure the ob~servance of it. This gave rife to a
pra~tice in Germ-any, which conveys to us a
£triking; idea both of the intolerable calamities

occafxoned 'by private wars, and of the feeble-
ness· of g~overnment during the twelfth and th~ir-
teenth centuries. The cities a-nd nobles entered
Sinto alliances an~d asso~ciations, by wvhich they
bound the'mfelves to maintain the ~pub'lick p ac~e,
and 'to ua~ke war on s~uch as thould violate it.
Tfhis was the origin of the le~ague of the R~hine,
of·~aabia, and of many smaller ·confederacies
diffingulf~hed by various names. The rif~e, pro-
grefs, and beneficial effe~ts of there affocia-
tions are traced by Datt, wvith great accuracy.
WThatever degree of puxblick peace, or of regular
adminiffration was preserved in the E-mpire from
the beginning of the twelfth century to the close
of the fifteenth, Germany ow~es to ther~e leag~ues.
During that period, political order, refpe~t for
the laws, together with the equal adminiffra-
tion of juffice, made consid~erable progref's in
Germany. But the final and perpetual aboliti~on
of· the right of private wrar was not accomplifhied
until A.- D. x 495. The imperial authority was
·by that time moi~e firmly established, the ideas
o~f men wvith refped~ to government and f~ubor-
'din~ation were become more just. That b~arba-
r~ous andl pernicious privilege which the nobles
-had to long poreffed , was declared to be in-
-compatible with the happine~s ·and existence of
society. Iii: order to terminate any differences
which might arise among the various members
--of the Germanick body, the Imperial chamber
was instituted with supreme junrif kitifion, to judge

wvithout

without ·appeal in every question brought before
it. That coulrt has fubifxted since that peri~od,
forming a very refpegtable tribunal, of essential
importance in the Germ~an constitution. Datt,

A remarkable instance occurs of ~the decsi~an oss
an abftrdt point of laws by combat. A question
arose in the thenth century concerning the right
of reprefestation, whpfichn was not then sued,
thougrb nowx univ-erfall eftablithed in every part
of Europe. ,, It was a matter of doub~t and dif-
pulte (f~aith thie historian, ) wheth~er the sons of
a son ought to be reckioned anongr th~e children
of th~ie familyr, and faceed equally with~ their
urncl~es, if their fa-ther happtened to die wihile
their grandfathier was alive.t~ An af~emblyt wsas

the general opinion that it ought to be remitted

caprice of folly to lead men to any aation more
extravagant than this of f~ettling a point in law
by combat, it must be that of referring the truth
or falsehood of a religious opinion to be decided
in the fame manner. To the disgrace of human
reason, it has been capable even of this extra-
.vagance. A queltion was ·agitated in Spain in
the eleventh century, whether the Mufarabic
Liturgy and ritual which~ had been afed in the
churches of Spain; or that approved of by the
See of Rome, which differed in mnany particu-
lars from .the other, contained the form of
wTortihip mofk acceptable to the Deity. The
Spaniards contended zealously for the ritual of
their anceffors. The Popes urged them to re-
ceive that to which they had givren their infal-
liible f~an~ion. A violent contest arose. The no-
bles proposed to decide the controversy by the
sw~ord. The King approved of this method of
deciiion. TwTP knigrhts in compl~ete armour en-
tered the ifts. John Ruys de 1Viantanca, the
champion of the Muf'arabic Liturgy, was vi&o~-
rious. But the Queen and Archbifiha.p of Toledo,
.who favoured the other form, insisted on having

the mater submitted to another trial, and had

interei~t enough to prev~tal5 in ~a reque~st, inaconfi~ent
with the laws of pomsbat, w~hEc~h be~ing codnidered
na atn app~eal to-God, thie delcifien ;ought: to h:ave

The reafonl given for obhg~ing a witness to ac-

That~the trial by judicialfcombat wxas efint-

bifhed in every country of Europe, 'is a faB
well known, and requires no proof. That -this
motde of decision was frequent, appears not
only fromn the codes of ancient lawTis wchich' efta-
Blifhed it, but fromn the earliest writers conrcern-
ing the i5ratic-e of lawc in thle diferenht nations
of Europe. 'They 'treat of this cuftaom at great
length; they entarnerate th~e regulations concern-
ing it with minute accuracy; and explain them
with much ~ so-licitude. It made a capital and

any one f'b~jeat in their fyitem of law whia~ch
Beauma~noir , Desfontain es , or the compilers of

of greater importance ; and none oine which they
have beffewoed to much attention. Th~ fjame
observation will hold with ref~pe&t to the early
aulthors of other nations. It appearrs from IVa-

Aox, that trials ofE this kind wvere to frequent

This spqde of trial wa~s to acceptable, that

ecclefiafticks, notwtithffandiPg theu prorhibitions
of -the church, were contained not only to
connive at the pradice, but to authorize it.
A .remarkable inlftance of this is pr oduced by
Pafiguier Recherches, lib. iv. ch. i. P. 350. The
abhot ~Wittikindus, whose wsprdyg I have produc-
ed ~in this note, considered the dyeterrmination
of a point in law by comb~at, as the b~est and

anoft honorable mode of decifxon. In thne year
978 , a judicial combat was fought in the pre-
fence of the Emperor Henry. The archb~ishop
Aldebert adv'ifed him to terminate a confteft
whichf had~ arisen be~tween two noblemen of his

The text contains the g~reat outlines which

mark the course of private and publick juiri-
di~tion in the several nations of Europe. I thall
here follow more minutely the va~rious iteps

of this progress, as the matter is curiouls andl
important enough to merit this attention. The
payment of a fine by way of fatis~fation to
the person or family inljured, was the first
device of a rude people, in order to check the
career of private re~sentment, anti to ;extinguish
those faidae, or deadly feuds wthich were prose-
cuted amonmg them with ithe uttmoft violence.
This cuffomn may be traced back to the ancient
Germans, Tacit. de IMorib. ~Ger-m. c. 21. and
prevailed among~ oth~er uncivilized n~ation~s. Ma-
my examples of this are colleaed by the in-
g~enious and learned author of Hillorical LawT-
Tra~ts, vol. i. p. 41. There in-es were af~cer-

At fuirt they were fettled by voluntary agree-

their rage began to ~u'bfide, and they felt the
bad effeass of their continuing in enmity, they
came to terms of concord, and the fhtisfadtionm
made was called a composition, implying that
it was filxed by mutual cod~ent. De P'Efiprit

renewed hostilities, and was guilty of any vio-

quarters of his dominions, this invited his sub-
je~ts to have recourse to it. It was the private
intfereft of the Baillis, as well as an obje& of
publick policy , to extend their jurif~di&ion.
They took advantage of every defedt in the
rights of the barons, and of every error in their

proceeding , to remove caus~es out ·of their
courts, and to bring themn under thteir owTn cog-
nlizance. Th~ere was a d~iftimsn in theP if-fedal

exemptionl fro~m the civil jur~ifd~ioin . It is
certain, that during the early~ an~d puref t ages
of the -church, -they pretended to no such ima~n-

tended to aill pler~fens, and to all causes. This
fa& has not only been clearly eftabith~ed by Pro-
tefEtant authors, but is admitted by mnany Ro-
man Cath·oicks of emninence, and particulary
by the writers in defence of the liberties of the
Gaican church. There are several origial
papers purbithed by Muratori, wJI~ch thew that,
in the mnlth an~d tenth centuries, causes of th7e
greatest importanlce relating to ecclefiafticks were~
still determined by civil juig-es. Antiq. ItaL.

was us~ual for the persons contarading to-maention

be known how any controverty· that Thould ariife
between them ·was to be decided. I~nunuerab'le
proofs of this occur in the charters of the mid-
d le ages. But the clergy considered it as furch
a valuable privilege of their order to be govern-
ed by thei Roman law, that when any person
entered into holy orders, it was usual for him
to renounce the lIawsr to which he had been forr-
merly fuibjet&, and to declare that he nowT fab-

The manners of the fauperior order o~f ecclefraficks

proof that the diftin~i~ion of profeirons wa~s hardly
known in Europe. The fun~tions and charaaer
of the clergy are obviouflly very different from
those of laymen; and among the inferior orders
of churchmen , this consti·tuted a diftinrS ch-f-
ra~ter separate from that~ of other citizens. Me-~t
the dignified ecclefiafti·cks, wvho we~re fre~quently
of noble birth, were above futch diitin~tion; they
retained the idea of w~hat helong~ed to them as·
g~entlemen, and in spite of the decrees ofPopes,
or the canons of councils, they bore armis, led
their vassals to the field, and fought atL their
head in ba;ttl~e. Amongn them the pr-ie~thood wzas

fearcely a. separate profefiion ; the military ac-
comrp-lifhments wrhich they thought: ess~ential to
thteim as gentlemen, were cultivated; the thieo-
logical science, and pacifick virtues faitable tos
the~r:iir fiitual fanation , were negletfed and

de fp-ifed. A-st fooij as the fecienlce of law became a
l borious flud y, and the pradice of it a fepa-
rate profe~iah;, s~ue as roeftto eminence in it
obtained honors' formerly appropriated to fol-
diers. Kn~ighthood was the moss illuffrious mark
of d'iftindtion during several ages, and conferred
privileges to whic~h rank or birth alone were not
entitled. To thi-s high dignityI persons eminent
for ·their k~nowledge of lay were advanced, and'
by that were places on a le~vel with those whom
their military talents had rendered confpicnous.

The fbibje~t of mry ··enquiries does not call

rn-e to write a hifteary of the progress of fiecince.
The facts and observations which I have pro-
duced, are f~ufficient to illuffrate thfe effe~ts of
its progress upon manners and the ftatet of so-

ciety. While science was altogether extin&
in the weffern parts of ·Europe , it was
cultivated in Connitantinople and other parts
of the Greciah 'Empire. But the fazbtile ge-
nius of the Greeks turned almost entirely to
theological disputation. The Latins borrowed
that S~piri~t fro.m them, and many of the contro-
verfies which fcill occupy, and divide theolo-
gians, took their 3-rife among the Greekrs, from
*wh~om the other Europeans derived a confider-
ab'le part of their knowledge. See the tefti-
man~y 3f J~neas Sylvius ap. Conringium de
antiq. academicis, p. 43. Hiffoire ·litteraire de
France, tom. vii. p. II3, &c. tom, ix. p. x5x,
&c. Soon after the Empire of the Caliphs was
ft~ablithed in the East, fibme i~llufrious princes
srofe~ among ~them , who encouraged s~cience.
B~ut whenz the -Arabians- turned thei-r at~tention to
the literature cultivated by the ancient Greeks
and Roman , .the chaste and corre £1 tast~e of their
works of genius appeared frigid and unanimated
to a pieopl~e of a more warm imagination. It
was impoilible for them to admire the poets and
hifforians of Athens, or . f Rome. But the~y
were s~ensible of the merit of their philofophiers.
The operation of the intelle~t are more fixe4i
and uniform than those of the fancy or taste.
Truth makes an imprefflon nearly the fame in
every place, the ideas of what is beautiful,
elegant, or ;thblime , vary in different climates.
'Ihe Arabians, though they negle~ted Honi~er,

translated the most eminent of the Greek philio-
fophers into their own language; and , guided
by their precepts and difooveries, applied them-
selves with great ard our to the study of geome-
bty, aitronomny, mnedicine, diale~tics, and me-
taphyfics. In the three former they made con-
fidrah~le and us~eful improvements, which have
coantributed not a little to advance thoife feiciences
to that high degree of perfe~tion which* they
have attained. In the tw;o latter, they chose
Ari~stotle fbr their guide, and reftning on the
sub~tle and diftinguilhing spirit which chara~e-
rizses, his philosophy, they rendered it altoge-
thier frivolous or uninteligible. The schools
e~stablished in the East for teaching and onltivat-
ing; there s~ciences, were in high reputatibn1.
They communicated their love of fcien ce to thei~r
, ounltrymen, who conlquered Africa and Spain;
and the s~chools instituted there were little infe-
rior in famce to those in the East. Mlany of the
pers~ons who dlifinguifhed themselves by their
proficiency in ficience in the twelrft- and thirteenth
centuries, were educated among the Arabians.
Bruck~erus colleats many infltances of this, TIT-
ftor. Philof'. v. iii. p. 681, & c. Almost all the
men eminent for fecience during several centu-
ries, were initrdied in the philosophy of the
Ahrabians. The firR kn~owledge of the ~AriftoteL
lian p~hilosophy in the middle ages, was acquired
by translations of his wrorks out of the Arabick.

Schoolmnen derived the genius and prnnciples of
their philosophy, which contributed to much
to retard th'e progrefi of true science.

The eftablifhtnent of Colleges or Ufniverfi-

ties ,is a remarkable aera in literary history.
Thie kho~ols in cathedrals and monas~te~ries con-
fined themselves chiefly to the teaching· of g-ram-
mar. There w-ere only one or two masters em-
ployed in that office. But in colleges, p~rofef-
fors w~ere appointed to teach all the different
parts of fecience. The course or order of educa-
tion was fixed. Thre time that ought to be al-
lotited .to the study of each feience was as~certain-

wrife a Ipr~odu~itio of the East Some! plants of

th~e s~ugar-cane were brought from Asia ; and
the firff attempt to cultivate them in Sicily wats
made about the middle of the twelfth century.
Erom thence they were transplanted inito the
fonzthern provinces of Spain. From Spain they
were carried to the Canary and IVadeira isles,
and at length into the new world. Ludovico
Gmiccoardm1i, ur enumerating the goods import-
ed into Atititerp, about the year rg oo,' men-
tionrs the sugar wihich they received from Spain
annd Portugarl as a considerable :article. He doa
fEribes that as the produft of the IMadeira and
Cangryt islands. Deferitt. de Paefl 1ail D. ?80·,
rs .?· The fugar~-cene was introduced into the
W~eftr~ndies before that time, but the cultiva-
tion of it was not toe confxderarble as to famnith
an article in commerce. In the rmiddle ages,
though sugar was not raised in fach quantities,
or -employed for so many purpofer , as to be-
come one of the common necei~aries of life , it
appears to have been a `considerable article in
the commerce of ~thIe I~aian slates.

There various commodities w~ith which the

Italians furnithed the other nations of Europe ,
procured them ~a favourable reception in every
kingdom.- They were established in France in
the thirteenth century with most exteniive- im-
munities. They nota~only obtai~ned every in-·
d ul~emde. favourable to their commerce , but
pers~onal rights and privileges were granted to
them , which the natives of the kizigdom did

not enjoy. Orden. tm. ivp. p.66. By a [pe-
eial proviro , they wNere exempted ~from the

bards engrefed the trade of eerry kingdom in
whichr they fettledl they became masters of its
cath. IVMoney of course was in their hands not
only a fin of the value of their commodities,
but became an objea of commerce Iitfelf. They
dealt largely as bankers. In an ·ordonance, A.

enlmpfores. TIhey carried on this as well as
othesr brantches of their co~mmrerce with fobme-
?what of that rapsacious spirit whic is natural to
monopoliz~ers who are not restrained by the
concurrence of rivals. An aidkeid opinion, which
prevailed irn the middle ages , wnas, how vever,
in some measure, the carrfe of their exorbitan~t
demands, and may be pleaded in apologry for
them. CommerTce canmot be carried on wFith
zav~atage, unless the persons wh-o lend a fnm
are allo~wed a certain premniumn for th~e are of
their money , as a compensa~tion for the risk
-which they run in permittinlg anoth-er to traf~fickSr
with their £tock. Trhis premium is die by
law in all commercial coun~tries, and is called
the legal intereR of money. But the Fathers
of the church prepoAeroufly applied the prohi-
bEitions of afary in fecripture to the payment of
legal interest, anld condemned it as 2 ai-n. The
<choolmen , mnifled by Aristotle , nh~ofE festi-
anepts they followed imgplicitly , and without

examination, adopted' the fame error-, and en.'
forced it. Blaekftone's Conuinentaries on the
laws of England, vol. ii. p. 455. Thus the
3Lomnbards -fournd thems~elves engaged in a traf-

They were liable to punifhmlent if dete~td.

the domineering and oppressive ifpirit of the no-

an order of citizens equally interested in opposing

a manrner pernicious to the Aate, if he himself
had been fabjeat to no controul. A conititujtio-
nal remnedy, ' however, was provided against
this danger. Seventeen persons were chosen by
]lot in each meeting of the Cortes. These formed
a tribunal called the court of inquisition into the
oflice of Juftiza. This court met at three sl~ated
terms in each year. Etvery perifon had liberty
of complaining to it of any iniquity or negled
of duty in the Juftiza, or in the inferior judges,
who adted. in his name. The Juffiza and his
deputies were called to answer for their condu&t.
TShe members of thle court passed s~entence by
ballot. They might punish by degradation ,
confiilcation of goods, or even with death. The

tional naifocia~tion, which pretende-d to legal. pri-
vileges, which i~ssued its ·mandates under a com-
men feal , and procereded in all its oper'ations-
by regular and ascertained forms. This dang~e-
roUs right was not only claimed, but exercif-
ed. In the year I287, the Ara-gonefe formed
art union in oppoitlton to Alfonso III. and oblig-
~ed. that KCing not only to comply with' their
demands, but to ratify -a privilege to fatal to
the power of the crown. Za~-rita Annales, tom. i. p.

agaijnft Peter IV. with equal iAccefs~, and a new
ratification of t~he privilege was exterted. Zurita,
tom. ii. p. aoz. But soon after, the King havg
ing defeated the leaders of the union in battle,
the privilege of union was fin~ally abrogated in
the Cortes, and all the laws or recor~ds which
colitained any confi'rmation of it, were cancel-
led. or defkroyed.· The Kingl, in presence of
the C~ortes,. called for the a.& whereby he had
Sratified ~the union , and having wounded his
hand with his poniard , he held it above the re-

cord, ,, that priv~lege, frays he, whi;~ch has

thSey claimed hights and exercised powers which

the progrets - of the French jurifprudene. The
l'dft of th& Caipitularia colleafed by· M. Balurel
was iffpjed 4i the -year 92:< , by Charles the
Simple. An hundcred and ·thirty· years elapsed
from that: p~eriod to the pu'blicati~on of the fir&
ordonance of the Kings of t~e 'third race , con.
tai~ned in trhe- great colle~tion of MI.. Lauriere,
and the firit: ordonance which·;appe~ars to be an
ass of legislatio~n extending toi the whole kting-
dom, is that of P hilip· Augafkuzs A. D. xx p o
Ordon. tom. i. p. 1. 4. During that long
period of on~e hundred and fixty-nine years , all
tranf~a~ions wvere dire~ted-by local customs, and.
no addidtio wa~s mazde to the fkatutory law of
France. The ordonances, previous to the reign
of Philip Augustus , contain· regulations , the
authority ofwhich did not extend beyond the
King's domains.

Variouas inflances oc~cur of the ca~uttion with

·oich the·Kings of France v~entured at 6fir to
exercise legifiative authority. MI. P'Ab. de Mably
produces ·an ordonance of Philip Auguflus, A.
D. x a06, concerning the Jews, 'who, in that

age, were in some mea~fuare the property ocf the
l~ord in whose territories they resided. Eut it
is not to much an aB of royal power, as a
treaty of Zhe King with the counters of Chatm-
pagne, and the -comte dle Dztopie~rre; and~i th~e
regulations in it seem · to be eftablif'hed no~t by
his authority, but by their conient. Obfervat.
fur P'hift. de France, ii. p. 355. In the ~fam~e
manner an ord~onance of Louis8 VIII. concerninIg
the Jews, A. D. I22a3, is a con-tra&t between
the Kings and· his nobles, with refp~ed to their
manner of treating that unhappy race of men.
Ordon. tom., i. p. 47. The Eftabliffemen~ts of
St. Louis , though well adlapted to serve as
general laws to ~the whole kingdom , were not
pu6ifhed as such, but only as a complete co~de
of custo~mary law , to be of authority within
the King's d~omains. The wyfidomn, the equity,
and the order conspicuous in that code iof
St. Louis , procured it a favourable receptiobn
throughout the kingdom. The veneration due
to the virtues and good intenti~ons of its au~thor,
contributed not a littl~e to reconcile the nation
to th~at legislative authority , which the King~
began to affamnne. Soon af~ter his time , the
idea of the King's poffef~ng thp-reme legislative
~power became common. If, says B~eaumanoir,
the King makes any eitablithment p·ecially for
hiis own domain, the barons may nev-ertheles~s
adhlere to their ancient customs ; but i~f the4
eft-ablifhlment be general , it thall be curren't

th~ropghout the whole kiingdom, and we ought
to lya~ieve that such attabli~f;~lethmen are made
with mature del~iberatilon, and for the general
g~ood'. CaPt. de Beauvoifisl , . 48. p. 265*
Thozwgh the Kings of the- third race did not call
the-~general assembly of the nation, during the
long period from Mugh Capret to Philip the Fair,
.yet they seem to ,have consulted the bi~hops and
ba~roas who haappened to be present: in their
courts with refpet& to anty- new law which they

Ths attention paid to the bayrons facilitated the
Kings acquxiring theh full pofediron of the legis-
la~tive~ power , as enabled them: afterwards to
ex~ercise it without observing that formality.

SThe hire~mblies distinguished by the name

of th~eStates General, were first called A. D.i
r3g2, and were held occaflonally from that
period to the year Ed x4, since which time·
theyT hve Dot beeri fummnoned. These were
very different from th~e ancient ass`emblies of
the· French nation ndrer the Kings of the first
and kecond trace. Ther~e is no point with re--
-fpedt to which the French antiquaries are more
generally agreed, than in maintaining that the
States G~eneral h~ad no fuffr-age in the pafling
of laws, and poffeffed no proper legislative ju-

rifdi~tion. The whale tenor of the Frencho
hiffory· c~onirms thir opi~nion. The form of
(woc~eedrin~g in the States G~eneral was this. Th~e
Ki~ng ad~dree himself to thef wh~ole ~o~dy as-
fembsled in onie place , and laid before th~em
the aflfa~irzs on ac~count of Nhich ·he had. fium-

·three orders, -of nobles, of elrg, and -of te
thir efiate, anet apart, and prepared their
cahiier or memorial, containing their anfwEer to
the propeditions which had been made to them,
together with the repr~efetations which they
~thought proper to lay before the King. These
answers and repreetations were confideredl
by the King in his cDR~Ci], A~dA geerhlyv gaVe
rife to anl sordonance. Th~ere o~rdonances- wiere
not aiddrefied to the thrEee Albat~es in -common.
Sometimes -th~e King addr~efed an ordonance to
each of the e~ae in particular. So~metimnes
he mentioned the assembly of the three ekates,
Someim~es mention is made only of the affem-
bly of that eaate to w~i~chl the ordonance i

All carufes relating to points of feudal right:

of government in any country is represented to
be defpotick, this does riot fappofe: that the
power -of the monarch is continually exertedt
in a~sof violence, injuiffice, and cruelty. Under
governments of e've~r [species , unlef's when
f'ome frantick tyrant happens to hold the f~eeli
ter, the ordita~ry adminiffration mu-st be con-
formnable to the principles of jrifice, and if not
ai~ive in promoting the welfare of the people,
cannot certainly have their deftwation for its
objeif. A st~ate, in which the forereig~n poffeffe3

venue; in which the people have no privileges,
and no part either immediate or remote in legis-

the exercise of arbitrary power is not different
fr~ont one of t~here of ·which I took notice. In-
deed, this restraint cannot be very considerable.
The Mufti, who is the head of the order, as

by th'e Sultan, and removable at pleas~ure, The
tansge means employed by the UZ~cma in l746,
to oibtain th~e' dif~inf-ilon of ,a Iminifter whom
they hated, is a manifes~t proof that they pofi
fess but little constitutional authority which can
serve as a reffr~aint upon the will of the fore-
reign.: Obfervat. p. 92 of ad edit. If the au.
thor's- idea be just , it is affonith~ing that the
body of the law thould have to method of re-
monitrating againf1 th-e erfors of adminiffration,
but by setting fi~re to the capital.

T'Ihe Author seems to confirder. the Capiculjr,

or sold-iery of the Porte, neither as formidable
infiirumients of the Sultan's power, nor as any
reffraint upon the exercis~e of'it. His reasons
for this opinion are, that the number of the
Capculy is hiall in p~ropoi~tion- to the oth~er
troops which comp'ofe the Turkifn armies, and
that in time of peace they are undisciplined.
