# PREFACE.

PREFACE.
IN fulfilling the engagement which I had

come under to the Public with refpet

to the Hiflory of America, it was my inten-
tion not to have published any part of the
work until the whole was completed. The
present state of the British Colonies has in-
duced me to alter that resolution. While
they are engaged in civil war with Great Bri-
tain, inquiries and speculations concerning
their ancient forms of policy and laws,
which exist no longer, cannot be interest-
ing. The attention and cxpctQation of man-
kind are now turned towards their future
condition. In whatever manner this un-
happy contefl may terminate, a new order
of things mllfli arise in North America, and
its affairs will aflliic another afpc&. I wait,
with the folicitudie of a good citizen, until
the fermenlt 1fblide, andl regular govcrnmcnt
l)e rc-enilali tlfed, arid tlhen 1 hlall rcturn to
tils part of my work, in which I hlad made

A 3 lome

some progress. That, together with the
hiflory of Portuguese America, and of the
settlements made by the several nations of
Europe in the Weft India islands, will com-
plete my plan.

TEIE three volumes which I now publish,

contain an account of the discovery of the
New World, and of the progress of the Spa-
hifh arms and colonies there. This is not
only the most splendid portion of the Ame-
rican story, but so much detached, as, by
itself, to form a perfect whole, remarkable
for the unity of the subjec. As the prin-
ciples and maxims of the Spaniards in plant-
ing colonies, which have been adopted in
some measure by every nation, are unfolded
in this part of my work; it will serve as a
proper introduction to the history of all the
European establishments in America, and
convey such information concerning this im-
portant article of policy, as may be deemed
no less interesting than curious.

IN describing the atchievements and infli-

tutions of the Spaniards in the New World,
I have departed in many inflances from !'e
accounts of preceding hil.orians, a ..

often related faas which seem to have been
unknown to them. It is a duty I owe the
Public, to mention the sources from which I
have derived such intelligence, as juflifies me
either in placing tranfaations in a new light,
or in forming any new opinion with refpe&
to their causes and effects. This duty I per-
form with greater fatisfaaion, as it will afford
an opportunity of expressing my gratitude to
those benefactors, who have honoured me
with their countenance and aid in my re-
farches.

As it was from Spain that I had to expe&

the most important information, with regard
to this part of my work, I confidered it as
a very fortunate circumflance for me, when
Lord Grantham, to whom I had the honour
of being personally known, and with whose
liberality of fentimcnt, and disposition to
oblige, I was well acquainted, was appointed
ambaifador to tile court of Madrid. Upon
applying to himi, I met with such a reception
as satisfied me that his cndcavo:'1s wo!ld be
employcd in tlhe moi proper manlier, in or-
der to obtain tie gratifi;'tion of r my wilhes;
anld I am perfcclly icrnililc, that what pro-
grc!s I h!:ve made in my inquirics among the

A 4 SIpaniards,

Spaniards, ought to be ascribed chiefly to
their knowing how much his Lordthip inte-
refied himself in my success.

BUT did I owe nothing more to Lord

Grantham, than the advantages which I have
derived from his attention in engaging Mr,
Waddilove, the chaplain of his embassy, to
take the conduac of my literary inquiries in
Spain, the obligations I lie under to him
would be very great. During five years,
that gentleman has carried on researches for
my behoof, with such activity, perseverance,
and knowledge of the fubjedt, to which his
attention was turned, as have filled me with
no less aftoniflment than fatisfadtion. He
procured for me the greater part of the Spa-
nifh books, which I have consulted; and as
many of them were printed early in the fix-
teenth century, and are become extremely
rare, the colleEcing of there was such an occu-
pation, as, alone, required much time and
aifiduity. To his fricndly attention I am in-
debted for copies of icvcral valuable manu-
scripts, containing facts and details which I
might have searchcd for in vain, in works
tlat have been made public. Encouraged by
the inviting good-will with which Mr. Wad-

dilove

dilove conferred his favours, I transmitted to
him a set of queries, with refpea both to the
cutomss and policy of the native Americans,
and the nature of several institutions in the
Spanih settlements, framed in such a manner,
that a Spaniard might answer them, without
disclosing any thing that was improper to be
communicated to a foreigner. He translated
these into Spanish, and obtained from various
persons who had resided in most of the Spa-
nifh colonies, such replies as have afforded
me much inftrution.

NOTWITHSTANDING those peculiar ad-

vantages with which my inquiries were car-
ried on in Spain, it is with regret I am ob-
liged to add, that their success mufl be
ascribed to the beneficence of individuals,
not to any communication by pullic autho-
rity. By a singular arrangement of Philip II.
the records of the Spanifli monarchy arc de-
posited in the ArcJhivo of Simancas, near Val-
ladolid, at the diflance of a hundred and
twenty miles from the f'at of government,
alld the fupricl courts of jullice. The
papers relative to Ainciicai, and chiefly to
that carly period of its liiltoy, towalrds whicli

that they alone, according to one account,
fill the largest apartment in the Archivo;
and according to another, they compose eight
hundred and feventy-three large bundles.
Conscious of possessing, in some degree, the
induflry which belongs to an hiflorian, the
profped of such a treasure- excited my most
ardent curiosity. But the profpet of it, is
all that I have enjoyed. Spain, with an ex-
cess of caution, has uniformly thrown a veil
over her tranfaaCions in America. From
1trangers they are concealed with peculiar so-
licitude. Even to her own fubjeats the Ar-
chivo of Simancas is not opened without a
particular order from the crown; and after
obtaining that, papers cannot be copied,
without paying fees of office so exorbitant,
that the expcnce exceeds what it would be
proper to beltow, when the gratification of
literary curiosity is the only objeEt. It is to
be hoped, that the Spaniards will at last dif-
covcr this fyftcm of concealment to be no
less impolitic than illiberal. From what I
have expericnced in the course of my in-
quiries, I am satisficd, that upon a more
minute fcrutliy into tlicir early operations in
the New World, hmwcv: r .

i ;.rchenrible the
,. ;, ), ".'[,., I-.F:,! Jl;''. :;'.-, the con-

duA

duct of the nation will be placed in a more
favourable light.

IN other parts of Europe very different

sentiments prevail. Having searched, with-
out success, in Spain, for a letter of Cortes
to Charles V. written soon after he landed
in the Mexican empire, which has not hi-
therto been published; it occurred to me,
that as the emperor was setting out for Gcr-
many at the time when the messengers from
Cortes arrived in Europe, the letter with
which they were intrusted might poflibly be
preserved in the Imperial Library of Vienna.
I communicated this idea to Sir Robert Mur-
ray Keith, with whom I have long had the
honour to live in friendship, and I had loon
the pleasure to learn, that, upon iis applica-
tion, her Imperial Majefly had been gra-
cioufly pleased to iflue an order, that not only
a copy of that letter (if it were f£lndl', iut
of any other papers in thle libr.ar, whicl
could throw light upon the 1 IiRorv of Amlc-
rica, should be tranfinittc to mnc. 'Ilic letter
from Cortes is not in the Imlperial T.ilbr.ir',
but an authentic copy, a;trC(lccd byj) not:r" ,
of that written Ly the iijagiilraltcS of tl :
colony planted by him ai V\'er (.I'.r, whicll

I II.i':

I have mentioned, Vol. ii. p. 254, having
been found; it was transcribed and sent to
me. This, no less curious, and as little
known as the letter which was the objea of
my inquiries, I did not receive until that part
of the hiflory to which it relates was printed;
but I have given some account of what is
mofl worthy of notice in it, at the end of
Notes and Illufirations, vol. iii. Together
with it, I received a copy of a letter from
Cortes, containing a long account of his ex-
pedition to Honduras, with refpea to which,
I did not think it necessary to enter into any
particular detail; and likewise those curious
Mexican paintings, which I have described,
vol. iii. p. 173.

MY inquiries at St. Peterfburgh were car-

ried on with equal facility and fucccfs. In
examining into the nearest communication
between our continent and that of America,
it became of consequence to obtain authentic
information concerning the discoveries of the
Ruffians in their navigation from Kamchatka
towards the coast of America. Accurate re-
lations of their firit voyage, in I74 , have
been publishcd by Muller and Gmelin. Se-
vcral forci.lg authors have entcrtained an

opinion,

opinion, that the court of Russia studiously
conceals the progress which has been made by
more recent navigators, and suffers the Public
to be amused with false accounts of their route.
Such conduc appeared to me unsuitable to
those liberal sentiments, and that patronage
of science, for which the prcfent fovercign of
Russia is eminent; nor could I dilcernl any
political reason, that might render it im-
proper to apply for information concerning
the late attempts of the Ruffians to open a
communication between Asia and America.
My ingenious countryman, Dr.Rogerfon, first
physician to the emprcfs, presented my re-
quest to her Imperial Majefiy, who not only
disclaimed any idea of concealment, but in-
flantly ordered the journal of Captain Krenit-
zin, who conduted the only voyage of dif-
covery made by public authority since the
year 1741, to be translated, and his original
chart to be copied for my use. By consulting
them, I have been enabled to give a more
accurate view of the progress and extent of
the Ruflian discoveries, than has hitherto been
communicated to the Public.

FROM other quartcrs I have received in-
fprmation of great utility and importance.

M. le

AM. le Chevalier de Pinto, the minister from
Portugal to the court of Great Britain, who
commanded for several years at Matagroflb,
a settlement of the Portuguese in the interior
part of Brasil, where the Indians are nu-
merous, and their original manners little
altered by intercourse with Europeans, was
pleased to fend me very full answers to some
queries concerning the character and inti-
tutions of the natives of America, which his
polite reception of an application made to
him in my name, encouraged me to pro-
pose. These satisfied me, that he had con-
templated with a discerning attention the
curious objects which his situation presented
to his view, and I have often followed him as
one of my bcft inftrud-ed guides.

M. SUARD, to whose elegant translation of

the Iiflory of the reign of Charles V. I owe
the reception of that work on the continent,
procured me answers to the fame queries
froni M. de Iouiglainville, who had opportu-
nities of obfcrving the Indians both of North
aind South America, and from M. (odin le
cjunc, who rcfided fifteen years among In-
dlians in Q!)ito, and twenty years in Cayenne.
The laIttr are more valuable from having

I been

been examined by M. de la Condamine, who,
a few weeks before his death, made some
Short additions to them, which may be con-
fidered as the last effort of that attention to
science which occupied a long life.

MY inquiries were not confined to one

region in America. Governor Hutchi:nson
took the trouble of recommending the confi-
deration of my queries to Mr. Hawley and
Mr. Brainerd, two protestant missionaries,
employed among the Indians of the Five Na-
tions, who favoured me with answers, which
discover a considerable knowledge of the
people whose customs they describe. From
William Smith, Efq; the ingenious historian
of New York, I received some useful informa-
tion. When I enter upon the H-Ilory of our
Colonies in North America, I shall have occa-
sion to acknowledge how much I have been
indebted to many other gentlemen of that
country.

FROM tll valuable Collel ion of Voynric;

made by Alexandcr Dalryrilplc, 3fEj'; v.wii
wliofe attention to the Iiiimry of \avilaiio
and Discovery the Public io well ac(anll;i(tcd,
I have received folne very rare books, paIti-

cuLi; i Iy

cularly two large volumes of Memorials,
partly manuscript, and partly in print, which
were presented to the court of Spain during
'the reigns of Philip III. and Philip IV. From
there I have learned many curious particulars
with refped to the interior slate of the Spa-
nifh colonies, and the various schemes formed
for their improvement. As this ColleCtion of
Memorials formerly belonged to the Col-
bert Library, I have quoted them by that
title.

ALL those books and manuscripts I have

consulted with that attention which the re-
spect due from an Author to the Public re-
quired; and by minute references to them,
I have endeavoured to authenticate whatever
I relate. The longer I reflec on the nature
of historical composition, the more I am con-
vinced that this scrupulous accuracy is ne-
ceffary. The historian who records the
events of his own time, is credited in pro-
portion to the opinion which the Public en-
tertains with refpcet to his means of inform-
ation and his veracity. I-Ic who delineatcs
the transaCtions of a remote period, has no
title to claim aflcnt, uiilcfs he produces evi-
dence in proof of his alTcrtions. Without

tlhis,

this, he may write an amusing tale, but
cannot be said to have composed an authentic
history. In those sentiments I have been
confirmed by the opinion of an Author*,
whom his industry, erudition, and discern-
ment, have deservedly placed in a high rank
among the most eminent historians of the
age. Emboldened by a hint from him, I
have published a catalogue of the Spanish
books which I have consulted. This praCtice
was frequent in the last century, and con-
fidered as an evidence of laudable industry in
an author; in the present, it may, perhaps,
be deemed the effect of ostentation; but as
many of these books are unknown in Great
Britain, I could not otherwise have referred
to them as authorities, without encumbering
the page with an insertion of their full titles.
To any person who may chufe to follow me
in this path of inquiry, the catalogue mutt
be very useful.

MY readers will observe, that in men-

tioning fums of money, I have uniformly
followed the Spanish method of computing
by pesos. In America, the pcfo Jucivrte, or
dtlro, is the only one known, and that is

* Mr. C;,l;ion.
Vol,. I. a always

always meant when any fum imported from
America is mentioned. The peso fuerte, as
well as other coins, has varied in its nume-
rary value; but I have been advised, with-
out attending to such minute variations, to
confider it as equal to four Ihillings and fix-
pence of our money. It is to be remem-
bered, however, that in the sixteenth cen-
tury, the effecive value of a peso, i. e. the
quantity of labour which it represented, or of
goods which it would purchase, was five or
fix times as much as at present.

A M E R I C A

BOOK I.
T HE progress of men in discovering and i oo oK

peopling the various parts of the earth, has i'

!been extremely flow. Several ages elapsed before Th lypt'
' they removed far from those mild and fertile re- pled.

gions where they were originally placed by their
i Creator. The occasion of their first general dif-
perfion is known; but we are unacquainted with
jthe course of their migrations, or the time when
X they took poffelffon of the different countries which
:they now inhabit. Neither history nor tradition
furnish such information concerning those remote
^events, as enables us to trace, with any certainty,
the operations of the human race in the infancy of
society.

WE may conclude, however, that all the early Firn migra-

migrations of mankind were made by land. The lind.
pcean, which every-where surrounds the habitable
irth, as well as the various arms of the sea which
' VOL. I. B separate

B 0 0 K separate one region from another, though deffined
,- .-a to facilitate the communication between distant

countries, feemi at first view, to be formed to
check the progress of man, and to mark the
bounds of that portion of the globe to which
nature had confined him. It was long, we may
believe, before men attempted to pass these for-
midable barriers, and became so skilful and ad-
ventrous as to commit themselves to the mercy of
the winds and waves, or to quit their native Ihores
in quest of remote and unknown regions.
Pirt at- NAVIGATION and ship-building are arts so nice

"wards na'i and complicated, that they require the ingenuity, as
tjion.· well as experience, of many successive ages to bring

them to any degree of perfection. From the raft or
canoe, which first served to carry a savage over the
river that obfirufted him in the chace, to the con-
ftruction of a vessel capable of conveying a nume-
rous crew with safety to a distant coast, the progress
in improvement is immense. Many efforts would
be made, many experiments would be tried, and
much labour as well as invention would be em-
ployed, before men could accomplish this arduous
and important undertaking. The rude and im-
perfect Ihate in which navigation is fill found
among all nations which are not considerably ci-
vilized, correlponds with this account of its pro-
grefs, and demonstrates that, in early times, the
art was not so far improved as to enable men to

4 .* ., undertake

9/,

undertake diflant voyages, or to attempt remote B °0 KC
discoveries. -

As soon, however, as the art of navigation be- Introduc.

came known, a new species of correspondence ,comerce,
among men took place. It is from this era, that
we must date the commencement of such an in-
tercourfe between nations as deserves the appella-
tion of commerce. Men are, indeed, far advanced
in improvement before commerce becomes an ob-
ject of great importance to them. They mufd
even have made some considerable progress to-
wards civilization, before they acquire the idea of
property, and ascertain it so perfectly, as to be
acquainted with the most simple of all contracts,
that of exchanging by barter one rude commodity
for another. But as soon as this important right
is established, and every individual feels that he
has an exclusive title to possess or to alienate what-
ever he has acquired by his own labour and dex-
terity, the wants and ingenuity of his nature fug-
gest to him a new method of increasing his ac-
quifitions and enjoyments, by disposing of what is
superfluous in his own stores, in order to procure
what is necefTary or delirable in those of other
men. Thus a commercial intercourse begins, and
is carried on among the members of the fame
community. By degrees, they discover that neigh-
bouring tribes poffcfs what they themselves want,
and enjoy comforts of which they wish to partake.
In the fame mode, and upon the fame principles,

B 2 liha

i o o K that domeflic traffic is carried on within the foci.

I. v-..- ety, an external commerce is established with other

tribes or nations. Their mutual interest and mu-
tual wants render this intercourse desirable, and
imperceptibly introduce the maxims and laws
which facilitate its progress and render it secure.
But no very extensive commerce can take place
between contiguous provinces, whose lbil and cli-
mate being nearly the fame, yield similar produc-
tions. Remote countries cannot convey their com-
modities by land,: to those places, where on ac-
count of their rarity they are desired, and become
valuable. It is to navigation that men are indebt-
ed for the power of transporting the superfluous
flock of one part of the earth, to supply the wants
of another. The luxuries and blessings of a parti-
cular climate are no longer confined to itself alone,
but the enjoyment of them is communicated tothe
molt distant regions.

IN proportion as the knowledge of the advan-

tages derived from navigation and commerce con-
tinued to spread, the intercourse among nations
extended. The ambition of conquefl, or the ne-
ceflity of procuring new settlements, were no
longer the sole motives of visiting distant lands.
I'he desire of gain became a new incentive to ac-
tivity, roused adventurers, and sent them forth'
vpon long voyages, in search of countries, whose
produts or wants might increase that circulation,
which nourishes and gives vigour to commerce.

Trade

Trade proved a great source ofdifcovery, it opened B 010 K
unknown seas, it penetrated into new regions, and ---v-
contributed more than any other caule, to bring
men acquainted with the situation, the nature and
commodities of the different parts of the globe.
But even after a regular commerce was established
in the world, after nations were considerably civil-
ized, and the iciences and arts were cultivated
with ardour and success, navigation continued to
be so imperfect, that it can hardly be said to have
advanced beyond the infancy of its improvement
in the ancient world.

AMONG all the nations of antiquity the structure mpcrrec-

tion of na-

of their vessels was extremely rude, and their me- vieatinn a-
thod of working them very defective. They were ,"i,^,n,'
unacquainted with some of the great principles and
operations in navigation, which are now confidered
as the first elements on which that science is found-
ed. Though that property of the imagnrt, by
which it attracts iron, was well known to the an-
cients, its more important and amazing virtue of
pointing to the poles had entirely escaped their ob-
krvation. Destitute of this faithful guide, which
now conducts the pilot with Ib much certainty in
the unbounded ocean, during the darkness of
night, and when the heavens are c6vered with
clouds, the ancients had no other method of re-
gulating their courle than by oblerving the fun
and flars. Their navigation was of confcquence
uncertain and timid. '[hey durlt Icldom quit

B 3 light

B °Q 0 K fight of land, but crept along the coast, exposed
'-c--' to all the dangers, and retarded by all the ob-

firucions, unavoidable in holding such an auk-
ward course. An incredible length of time was
requisite for performing voyages, which are now
finished in a short space. Even in the mildest
climates, and in seas the least tempefluous, it was
only during the summer months that the ancients
Ventured out of their harbours. The remainder
of the year was loit in inactivity. It would
have been deemed most inconsiderate rashness to
have braved the fury of the winds and waves dur-
ing winter .

WHILE both the science and practice of naviga-

tion continued to be f-. defeEtive, it was an un-
dertaking of no fmail difficulty and danger to vi-
fit any remote region of the earth. Under every
disadvantage, however, the active spirit of com-

Navigtion merce exerted itfclf. The Egyptians, loon after
arid corn-
rncce of the establishment of their monarchy, are said to
a'.Egyp." have opened a trade between the Arabian Gulph

or Red Sea, and the weitcrn coalt of the great In-
dian continent. The coinmmodiries which they im-
ported from the east, were carried by land from

of Egypt produced the necessaries and comforts of B O o K
life with such profusion, as rendered its inhabitants --
so independent of other countries, that it became
an established maxim among that people, whose
ideas and institutions differed in almost every point
from those of other nations, to renounce all inter-
course with foreigners. In consequence of this,
they never went out of their own country; they
held all sea-faring persons in detestation, as impi-
ous and profane; and fortifying their own har-
bours, they denied firangers admittance into them";
and it was in the decline of their power, that they
again opened their ports, and resumed any com-
munication with foreigners.

THE character and situation of the Phenicians or the

were as favourable to the spirit of commerce and P'Ilc"nian8
discovery as those of the Egyptians were averse to
it. They had no diltinguifhing peculiarity in their
manners and inltitutions; they were not addicted
to any singular and unsocial form of superstition;
they could mingle with other nations without
scruple or reluctance. The territory which they
pofefled was neither large nor fertile. Commerce
was the only source froni which they could derive
opulence or power. Accordingly, the trade car-
ried on by the Phenicians of Sidon and Tyre, was
more extensive and enterprising than that of any

B 0o K state in the ancient world. The genius of the
»l_-v Phenicians, as well as the objeEt of their policy

and the spirit of their laws, were entirely com-
mercial. They were a people of merchants who
aimed at the empire of the sea, and actually possess-
ed it. Their ships not only frequented all the
ports in the Mediterranean, but they were the first
who ventured beyond the ancient boundaries of
navigation, and pasing the Streights of Gades,
visited the western coats of Spain and Africa. In
many of the places to which they retorted, they
planted c lonies, and communicated to the rude
inhabitants lome knowledge of their arts and im-
provements. While they extended their disco-
veries towards the north and the weft, they did
not negledt to penetrate into the more opulent and
fertile regions of the iouth and east. Having ren-
dered themselves masters of fiveral commodious
harbours towards the bottom of the Arabian Gulph,
they, after the example of the Egyptians, efla-
blilhed a regular intercourse with Arabia and the
continent of India on the one hand, and with the
eaftrrn coalt of Africa on the other. lFroin there

obtained, partly by their conquest of Idumea,
which itretches along the Red Sea, and partly by
their alliance with Hiram king of Tyre. SAlomon
fitted out fleets, which, under the direction of
Phenician pilots, failed from the Red Rea to Tar-
shish and Ophir. These it is probable were ports
in India and Africa which their conduCtors were
accustomed to frequent, and from them the Jewish
fhiips returned with such valuable cargoes as fud-
denly diffused wealth and splendour through the
kingdom of Ifracl d. But the singular institutions
of the Jews, the observance of which was enjoined
by their divine legilator, with an intention of pre-
serving them a leparate people, uninfeRted by
idolatry, formed a national chara&tcr incapable of
that open and liberal intercourle with Itrangers
which commerce requires. Accordingly, this un-
Iocial genius of the people, together with the dif-
alters which bcfel the kidiidom of Ilradc, pievented
the commercial spirit which their monarchs labour-

rt..- of their laws, they tranfmnitted the commercial fpi-

rit with facility, and in full vigour, to their own
descendants the Carthaginians. The common-
wealth of Carthage applied to trade and to naval
affairs, with no less ardour, ingenuity, and success,
than its parent state. Carthage early rivalled, and
soon surpassed Tyre, in opulence and power, but
seems not to have aimed at obtaining any share in
the commerce with India. The Phenicians had
engrossed this, and had such a command of the
Red Sea as secured to them the exclusive poffelfion
of that lucrative branch of trade. The commercial
activity of the Carthaginians was exerted in another
direction. Without contending for the trade of the
east with their mother-country, they extended their
navigation chiefly towards the weft and north. Fol-
lowing the course which the Phenicians had open-
ed, they passed the Streights of Gades, and push-
ing their discoveries far beyond those of the parent
hate, visited not only all the coasts of Spain, but
those of Gaul, and penetrated at last into Britain.
At the fame time that they acquired knowledge of
new countries in this part of the globe, they gra-
dually carried their researches towards the South.
They made considerable progress, by land, into
the interior provinces of Africa, traded with Itme
of them, and fubjeced others to their empire.

NOR was the progress of the Phenicians and Car-

thaginians in their knowledge of the globe, owing
entirely to the desire of extending their trade from
one country to another. Commerce was followed
by its usual effeds among both these people. It
awakened curiosity, enlarged the ideas and desires
of men, and incited them to bold enterprises.
Voyages were undertaken, the sole object of which
was to discover new countries, and to explore un-
known seas. Such, during the prosperous age of
the Carthaginian republic, were the famous navi-
gations of Hanno and Himilco. Both their fleets
were equipped by authority of the senate, and
at public expence. Hanno was directed to fleer
towards the south, along the coast of Africa, and
he seems to have advanced much nearer the equi-
nodial line than any former navigator'. Himilco
had it in charge to proceed towards the north, and
to examine the weltern coasts of the European con-
tinent g. Of the fame nature was the extraordinary

king of Egypt, took its departure about fix hun.

a port in the Red Sea, doubled the southern pro-
plontory of Africa, and after a voyage of three
years, returned by the ftreights f Gades, to the
mouth of the Nile h. Eudoxus of Cyzicus is said
to have held the fame course, and to have accom-
plifhed the fame arduous undertaking

THESE voyages, if performed in the manner

which I have related, may justly be reckoned the
greatest effort of navigation in the ancient world;
and if we attend to the imperfect state of the art at
that time, it is difficult to determine whether we
should molf admire the courage and sagacity with
which the delign was formed, or the conduct and
good fortune with which it was executed. But
unfortunately, all the original and authentic ac-
counts of the Phenician and Carthagian vogages,
whether undertaken by public authority, or in
prosecution of their private trade, have perilhed.
The information which we receive concerning them
from the Greek and Roman authors, is not only
obscure and inaccurate, but, if we except a short
narrative of Hanno's expedition, is of lufpiicious
authority k. Whatever acquaintance with the re-

ginians may have acquired was concealed from the '---
reft of mankind with a mercantilejealoufy. Every
thing relative to the course of their navigation was
not only a mystery of trade, but a secret of state.
Extraordinary fats are recorded concerning their
solicitude to prevent other nations from penetrating
into what they wished should remain undivulged'.
Many of their discoveries seem, accordingly, to
have been scarcely known beyond the precincts of
their own states. The navigation round Africa,
in particular, is recorded by the Grtek and Roman
writers, rather as a strange amusing tale, which
they either did not comprehend, or did not be-
lieve, than as a real tranfaItion, which enlarged
their knowledge and influenced their opinion m. As
neither the progrcfs of the Phenician and Cartha-
ginian discoveries, nor the extent of their naviga-
tion, were communicated to the redt of mankind,
all memorials of their extraordinary skill in naval
affairs teem, in a great mealiure, to have perifled,
when the maritime power of the former was anni-
hilated by Alexander's conqucft of Tyre, and the
empire of the latter was overturned by the Roman
arms.

B o o K tory muff reft satisfied with relating the progress of
L._,i navigation and discovery among the Greeks and

Romans, which, though less splendid, is better
ascertained. It is evident that the Phenicians, who
inftrucled the Greeks in other useful sciences and
arts, did not communicate to them that extensive
knowledge of navigation which they themselves
possessed; nor did the Romans imbibe that com-
mercial spirit and ardour for discovery which dif-
tinguifhed the Carthaginians. Though Greece be
almost encompassed by the sea, which formed
many spacious bays and commodious harbours,
though it be surrounded by a vast number of ser-
tile ilands, yet, notwithstanding such a favourable
situation, which seemed to invite that ingenious
people to apply themselves to navigation, it was
long before this art attained any degree of perfec-
tion among them. Their early voyages, the ob-
jet of which was piracy rather than commerce,
were so inconsiderable, that the expedition of the
Argonauts from the coast of Thessaly to the Eux-
ine sea, appeared such an amazing effort of skill
and courage, as entitled the conductors of it to be
ranked among the demigods, and exalted the vessel
in which they failed to a place among the heavenly
constellations. Even at a later period, when the
Greeks engaged in their famous enterprize againfl
Troy, their knowledge in naval affairs teems not
to have been much improved. According to the
account of Homer, the only poet to whom history
ventures to appeal, and who, by his scrupulous

accuracy

accuracy in describing the manners and arts of early B 0o0 K
ages, merits this diftin&tion, the science ofnaviga- -
tion, at that time, had hardly advanced beyond its
rudest state. The Greeks in the heroic age were
unacquainted with the use of iron, the most ser-
viceable of all the metals, without which no con-
fiderable progress was ever made in the mechanical
arts. Their vessels were ofinconfiderable burthen,
and moflly without decks. These had only one
mast, which they erected or took down at pleasure.
They were firangers to the use of anchors. All
their operations in failing were clumsy and unikil-
ful. They turned their observation towards tars,
which were improper for regulating their course,
and their mode of observing them w2S inaccurate
and fallacious. When they had finished a voyage
they drew their paltry barks ashore, as savages do
their canoes, and these remained on dry land until
the season of returning to sea approached. It is
not then in the early or heroic ages of Greece, that
we can expe6t to observe the science of navigation,
and the spirit of dilcovery, making any confider-
able progress. During that period of diforderand
ignorance, a thousand causes concurred in restrain-
ing curiosity and enterprize within very narrow
bounds.

BUT the Greeks advanced with rapidity to a

fiate of greater civilization and refinement. Go-
vernment, in its most liberal and perfect form, be-
gan to be established in the communities of Greece,

equal

B o 6 K equal laws and regular police were gradually intro-

--..-.- duced; the sciences and arts which are useful or

ornamental in life were carried to a high pitch of
improvement, and several of the Grecian com-
monwealths applied to commerce with such ardour
and success, that they were confidered, in the an-
cient world, as maritime powers of the first rank.
Even then, however, the naval victories of the
Greeks must be ascribed rather to the native spirit
of the people, and to that courage which the en-
joyment of liberty inspires, than to any extraordi-
nary progress in the fcienae of navigation. In the
Persian war, those exploits which the eloquence of
the Greek historians has rendered so famous, were
performed by fleets, composed chiefly of small
vessels without decks n; the crews of which rushed
forward with impetuous valour, but little art, to
board those of the enemy. In the war of Pelo-
ponnefus, their ships teem still to have been of in-
considerable burthen and force. The extent of
their trade was in proportion to this low condition
of their marine. The maritime frates of Greece
hardly carried on any commerce beyond the limits
of the Mediterranean lea. Their chief intercourse
was with the colonies of their countrymen, planted
in the Lesser Aria, in Italy and Sicily. They some-
times visited the ports of Egypt, of Gaul, and of
Thrace, or palling through the Hlellefpont, they
traded with the countries situated around the Eux-
ine sea. Amazing inflances occur of their igno-

Thucyd. lib. r. c. il.

rance,

rnce, even of those countries, which lay within B 0' K
the narrow precints to which their navigation was i
confined. When the Greeks had afrembled their
combined fleet against Xerxes at Egina, they
thought it unadvifable to fail to Samos, because
they believed the diflance between that island and
Egina to be as great as the distance between Egina
and the Pillars of Hercules0. They were either
utterly unacquainted with all the parts of the globe
beyond the Mediterranean sea, or what knowledge
they had of them was founded on conjeture, or
derived from the information of a few persons,
whom curiosity and the love of science had
prompted to travel by land into the Upper Asia,
or by sea into Egypt, the ancient feats of wisdom
and arts. After all that the Greeks learned from
them, they appear to have been ignorant of the
most important fats, on which an accurate and
scientific knowledge of the globe is founded.

THE expedition of Alexander the Great into the

east, considerably enlarged the sphere of naviga-
tion and of geographical knowledge among the
Greeks. That extraordinary man3 notwithltand-
ing the violent passions which incited him, at
some times, to the wildest actions, and the molf
extravagant enterprises, possessed talents which
fitted him not only to conquer, but to govern the
world. He was capable of framing those bold

. 00 K and original schemes of polily, which give a new
'L-.-- form to human affairs. The revolution in com-

merce, brought about by the force of his genius,
is hardly inferior to that revolution in empire,
occasioned by the success of his arms. It is pro-
bable, that the opposition and efforts of the re-
public of Tyre, which checked him so long in the
career of his victories, gave Alexander an oppor-
tunity of observing the vait resources of a maritime
power, and conveyed to him some idea of the im-
mense wealth which the Tyrians derived from their
commerce, especially that with the East Indies,
As soon as he had accomplished the deftruftion of
Tyre, and reduced Egypt to fubjetion, he formed
the plan of rendering the empire which he pur-
posed to establish, the centre of commerce as well
'as the feat of dominion. With this view he
founded a great city, which he honoured with his
own name, near one of the mouths of the river
Nile, that by the Mediterranean sea, and the
neighbourhood of the Arabian Gulf, it might
command the trade both of the east and weft P.
This Situation was chosen with such discernment,
that Alexandria soon became the chief commercial
city in the world. Not only during the subsistence
of the Grecian empire in Egypt and in the eafl,
but amidst all the fucceflive revolutions in thole
countries, from the time of the Ptolemies to the
discovery of the Navigation by the Cape of Good

Hope, commerce, particularly that of the Eafl B 0 0 K
Indies, continued to flow in the channel which the --y
sagacity and foresight of Alexander had marked
out for it.

His ambition was not satisfied with having

opened to the Greeks a communication with India
by sea; he aspired to the sovereignty of those re-
gions which furnished the reft of mankind with so
many precious commodities, and conducted his
army thither by land. Enterprising, however, as
he was, he may be said rather to have discovered,
than to have conquered that country. He did
not, in his progress towards the east, advance be-
yond the banks of the rivers that fall into the
Indus, which is now the western boundary of the
vast continent of India. Amidst the wild exploits
which distinguish this part of his history, he pur-
sued measures that mark the superiority of his ge-
nius, as well as the extent of his views. He had
penetrated as far into India as to confirm his opi-
nion of its commercial importance, and to perceive
that immense wealth might be derived from inter-
course with a country, where the arts of elegance
having been more early cultivated, were arrived at
greater perfection than in any other part of the
earths. Full of this idea he resolved to examine
the course of navigation from the mouth of the

C a Indus

B 0o 0 Indus to the bottom of the Persian Gulf; and if it
-.,---' hould be found practicable, to establish a regular

communication between them. In order to effect
this, he proposed to remove the cataracts, with
which, the jealousy of the Persians, and their
aversion to correspondence with foreigners, had
obflructed the entrance into the Euphrates r; to
carry the commodities of the east up that river,
and the Tigris, which unites with it, into the inte-
rior parts of his Asiatic dominions; while, by the
way of the Arabian Gulf, and the river Nile, they
might be conveyed to Alexandria, and distributed
to the reft of the world. Nearchus, an officer of
eminent abilities, was entrusted with the command
of the fleet fitted out for this expedition. He per-
formed this voyage, which was deemed an enter-
prise so arduous and important, that Alexander
reckoned it one of the moRl extraordinary events
which distinguished his reign. Inconsiderable as
it may now appear, it was, at that time, an under-
taking of no little merit and difficulty. In the
prosecution of it, striking instances occur of the
inmall progrels which the Greeks had made in naval
knowledge s. Having never failed beyond the
bounds of the Mediterranean, where the ebb and
flow of the sea are hardly perceptible, when they
first obfcrved this phenomenon at the mouth of
the Indus, it appeared to them a prodigy, by
which the gods testified the displeasure of Heaven

against

against their enterprie '. During their whole B 0 0 K
course, they seem never to have loft fight of land, ,---
but followed the bearings of the coast so servilely,
that they could not much avail themselves of those
periodical winds, which facilitate navigation in the
Indian ocean. Accordingly, they spent no lets than
ten months in " performing this voyage, which,
from the mouth of the Indus to that of the Persian
Gulf, does not exceed twenty degrees. It is pro-
bable, that amidlft the violent convulsions, and
frequent revolutions in the East, occasioned by the
contests among the successors of Alexander, the
navigation to India, by the course which Near-
chus had opened, was discontinued. The Indian
trade carried on at Alexandria, not only subsisted,
but was to much extended under the Grecian mo-
parchs of Egypt, that it proved a great source
of the wealth which dilinguifhed their kingdom.

THE progress which the Romans made in navi. or the Ro-

gation and dilcovery, was Rill more inconsiderable man
than that of the Greeks. The genius of the Ro-
man people, their military education, and the
lpirit of their laws, concurred in estranging them
from cormmeilt and naval affairs. It was the ne-
ceffity of opposing a formidable rival, not the dc-
fire of extending trade, which firll prompted
them to aim at maritime power. Though they
soon perceived that, in order to acquire the uni-

t Sec NOTE V. U Plin, llf. Nar. lib. vi. c. z3.

C 3 vcrifa

B 0 0 K yerfal dominion after which they aspired, it was

- ' necessary to render themselves masters of the sea,

they frill confidered the naval service as a fubordi-
nate station, and reserved for it such citizens as
were not of a rank to be admitted into the le-
gions x. In the history of the Roman republic,
hardly one event occurs, that marks attention to
navigation any farther than as it was instrumental
towards conquest. When the Roman valour and
discipline had subdued all the maritime states
known in the ancient world; when Carthage,
Greece, and Egypt, had submitted to their power,
the Romans did not imbibe the commercial spirit
of tne conquered nations. Among that people of
soldiers, to have applied to trade would have been
deemed a degradation of a Roman citizen. They
abandoned the mechanical arts, commerce, and
navigation, to slaves, to freedmen, to provincials,
and to citizens of the lowest class. Even after the
subversion of liberty, when the severity and
haughtiness of ancient manners began to abate,
commerce did not rife into high estimation among
the Romans. The trade of Greece, Egypt, and
the other conquered countries, continued to be
carried on in its' usual channels, after they were
reduced into the form of Roman provinces. As
Rome was the capital of the world, and the feat of
government, all the wealth and valuable produc-
tions of the provinces flowed naturally thither,

Polyb, lib. vo

T'he

The Romans, satisfied with this, teem to have sus- B 01 K
sered commerce. to remain almost entirely in the t-v-
hands of the natives of the respective countries.
The extent, however, of the Roman power, which
reached over the greatest part of the known world,
the vigilant infpetion of the Roman magifrates,
and the spirit of the Roman government, no less
intelligent than active, gave such additional fecu-
rity to commerce, as animated it with new vigour.
The union among nations was never so entire, not
the intercourse so perfet, as within the bounds of
this vast empire. Commerce, under the Roman
dominion, was not obftrt&ued by thejealoufy of
rival states, interrupted by frequent hoftilites, or
limited by partial reltristions. One superintending
power moved and regulated the industry of man-
kind, and enjoyed the fruits of their joint eforts.

NAVIGATION felt this influence, and improved

under it. As soon as the Romans acquired a tafle
for the luxuries of the East, the trade with India
through Egypt was puffed with new vigour, and
carried on to greater extent. By frequenting the
Indian continent, navigators became acquainted
with the periodical course of the winds, which,
in the ocean that separates Africa from India,
blow with little variation during one half of the
year from the cast, and during the other half fix
with equal fleadinefs from the welL. Encouraged
by obfervirg this, they abandoned their ancient
flow and dangerous course along the coalt, and as

---- parture from Ocelis, at the mouth of the Arabian

Gulf, and stretched boldly across the ocean Y. The
yniform direction of the wind, supplying the place
of the compass, and rendering the guidance of the
stars less necessary, conducted theni to the port of
Mufiris, on the weltern shore of the Indian conti-
nent. There they took on board their cargo, and
returning with the eastern monsoon, finished their
voyage to the Arabian Gulf within the year. This
part of India, now known by the name of the
Malabar coall, seems to have been the urmoft
limit of ancient navigation in that quarter of the
globe. .Wiat imperfeEt knowledge the ancients
had of the immense countries which firetch beyond
this towards the east, they received from a few
adventurers, who had visitcd them by land. Such
excursions were neither frequ: nt n;r extensive, and
it is probable, that while the Roman intercourse
with Incia subsisted, no traveller ever penetrated
fulrher than to the banks of the Ganges ". The
fleets from Egypt which traded at Mufiris were
loaded, it is true, with the ipices and other rich
commodities of the continent and islands of the
farther India; but thelf were brought to that port,
which became the flaple of this conmmerce, by the
Indians themfclves, in canoes hollowed out of

fitisfied with acquiring those commodities in this B 0 o K
manner, did not think it necessary to explore un- --
known seas, and venture upon a dangerous navi-
gation, in quest of the countries which produced
them. But though the diicoveries of the Romans
in India were so limited, their commerce there was
such as will appear considerable, even to the pre-
sent age, in which the Indian trade has been ex-
tended far beyond the practice or conception
of any preceding period. We are informed by
one author of credit b, that the commerce with
India drained the Roman empire every year of
more than four hundred thousand pounds; and by
another, that one hundred and twenty ships tailed
annually from the Arabian Gulf to that coun-

and expeditious method of dilcovery. The pro-
grels, however, of their victorious armies contri-
buted greatly to extend dilcovery by land, and

B OO K even opened the navigation of new and unknown
.- s. tfeas. Previous to the Roman conquests, the civil-

ized nations of antiquity had no communication
with those countries in Europe, which now form
its most opulent and powerful kingdoms. The
interior parts of Spain and Gaul were little known.
Britain, separated from the reft of the world, had
never been visited, except by its neighbours the
Gauls, and by a few Carthaginian merchants.
The name of Germany had scarcely been heard of.
Into all these countries the arms of the Romans
penetrated. They entirely subdued Spain and
Gaul; they conquered the greatest and most ser-
tile part of Britain; they advanced into Germany,
as far as the banks of the river Elbe. In Africa,
they acquired a considerable knowledge of the pro-
vinces, which firetch along the Mediterranean
sea, from Egypt westward to the straits of Gades.
In Aria, they not only subjected to their power
most of the provinces which composed the Persian
and Macedonian empires, but, after their vicories
over Mithridates and Tigranes, they seem to have
made a more accurate survey of the countries con-
tiguous to the Euxine and Caspian seas, and to
have carried on a more exrenfive trade than that of
the Greeks with the opulent and commercial na-
tions, then feated around the Euxine sea.

without substituting in its place the conjectures of
fancy, or the dreams of etymologists, we must
conclude, that the knowledge which the ancients
had acquired of the habitable globe was extremely
confined. In Europe, the extensive provinces in
the eastern part of Germany were little known to
them. They were almost totally unacquainted
with the vast countries which are now fubje& to
the kings of Denmark, Sweden, Prussia, Poland,
and the Ruffian empire. The more barren regions,
that itretch within the arflic circle, were quite
unexplored. In Africa, their researches did not
exiend far beyond the provinces which border on
the Mediterranean, and those situated on the
wetern (hore of the Arabian Gulf. In Asia, they
were unacquainted, as I formerly oblerved, with
all the fertile and opulent countries beyond the
Ganges, which furnilh the nioft valuable conmmo-
dities that, in modern times, have been the great
object of the European commerce with India; nor
do they teem to have ever penetrated into tlioe
jmmenle regions occupied by the wandering tribes,

whiclh

B .0 K which they called by the general name of Sarma.
t--Y--' tians or Scythians, and now pofieffed by Tartars

of various denominations, and by the Asiatic sub.
jees of Russia.

A remark- BUT there is one opinion, that universally pre-
able proot
ot this. vailed among the ancients, which conveys a more

striking idea of the small progress they had made
in the knowledge of the habitable globe, than can
be derived from any detail of their dilcoveries.
They fippofed the earth to be divided into five
regions, which they distinguished by the name of
zones. Two of these, which were nearcie the Poles,
they termed the frigid zones, and believed that the
extreme cold whicii reigned perpetually there, ren-
dered them uninhabitable. Another, feated under
the line, and extending on either fide towards the
tropics, they called the torrid zone, and imagined
it to be lo burnt up with unremitting heat, as to
be equally dettitute of inhabitants. On the two
other zones, which occupied the remainder of the
earth, they beflowed the appellation of temperate,
and taught that these, being the only regions in
which life could lubfift, were allotted to nlan for
his habitation. ''lhis wild opinion was not a con-
ceit of the uninformed vulgar, or a fanciful lition
of the poets, but a y)llem adopted by the molt
enlightened philosophers, the molt accurate hifto-
rians and geographers in Greece and Rome. Ac-
cording to this theory, a valt portion of the habit-
able earth was pronounced to be uI::ijt lr i litainingl

tlh

the human species. Thole fertile and populous B o00 K
regions within the torrid zone, which are now '--
known not only to yield their own inhabitants the
necefifrics and comforts of life, with most luxu-
riant profusion, but to communicate their super-
fluous stores to the reft of the world, were sup-
posed to be the mansion of perpetual sterility and
desolation. As all the parts of the globe, which
the ancients had discovered, lay within the northern
temperate zone, their opinion that the other tem-
perate zone was filled with inhabitants, was founded
on reasoning and conjecture, not on discovery.
They even believed that, by the intolerable heat
of the torrid zone, such an insuperable barrier was
placed between the two temperate regions of the
earth, as would prevent for ever any intercourse
between their refpe&ive inhabitants. Thus this
extravagant theory not only proves that the an-
cients were unacquainted with the true Itate of the
globe, but it tended to render their ignorance per-
petual, by representing all attempts towards open-
ing a communication with the remote regions of
the earth, as utterly impracticablc'

mans had acquired may appear, in refpcI of the

B 0o K extent to which they carried navigation and conn-

_-v- merce must be reckoned great, when compared

with the ignorance of early times. As long as the
Roman empire retained such vigour as to preserve
its authority over the conquered nations, and to
keep them united, it was an object of public
police, as well as of private curiosity, to examine
and describe the countries which composed this
great body. Even when the other sciences began
to decline, geography, enriched with new obferva-
tions, and receiving some acceflion from the expe-
rience of every age, and the reports of every

Improve- traveller, continued to improve. It attained to
mrents in
yeography the highest point of perfedtion and accuracy to
b' rtolemy. which it ever arrived in the ancient world, by the

industry and genius of Ptolemy the philosopher.
He flourished in the second century of the Christian
ara, and published a description of the terrestrial
globe, more ample and exact than that of any of
his predecessors.

barbarous nations, which Providence prepared as
its infsruments to overturn the mighty fabric of the
Roman power, began to assemble and to muster
their armies on its frontier; the enmpire tottered to
its fall. During this decline and old age of the
Roman state, it was impossible that the sciences

flould

should go on improving. The efforts of genius B 0 0 K
were, at that period, as languid and feeble as those v_
of government. From the time of Ptolemy, no
considerable addition seems to have been made to
geographical knowledge, nor did any important
revolution happen in trade, excepting that Con-
ftantinople, by its advantageous situation, and the
encouragement of the eastern emperors, became a
commercial city of the first note.

AT length, the clouds which had been so long EffrEs of

their con-

gathering round the Roman empire, burst into a quefls on
storm. Barbarous nations rushed in from several ic'neroua
quarters with irrefiflible impetuosity, and, in the
general wreck, occasioned by the inundation which
overwhelmed Europe, the arts, sciences, inven-
tions and discoveries of the Romans, perished in a
great measure, and disappeared g. All the various
tribes, which fettled in the different provinces of
the Roman empire, were uncivilized, firangers to
letters, deflitute of arts, unacquainted wih regu-
lar government, subordination, or laws. The
manners and inflitutions of oIme of them were so
rude, as to be hardly compatible with a state of
social union. Europe, when occupied by such in-
habitants, may be said to have returned to a lfcond
infancy, and had to begin anew its career in im-
provement, science, and civility. The firfl effect
of the settlement of those barbarous invaders was
to dissolve the union by which the Roman power

B 0O K had cemented mankind together. They parcelled
..-v- out Europe into many small and independent Rates,

differing from each other in language and customs.
No intercourse subsisted between the members of
those divided and hostile communities. Accustom-
ed to a simple mode of life, and averse to industry,
they had few wants to supply, and no superfluities
to dispose of. The names of Jranger and of enemy
became once more words of the fame import.
Customs every-where prevailed, and even laws
were established, which rendered it disagreeable
and dangerous to visit any foreign country b. Ci-
ties, in which alone an extensive commerce can be
carried on, were few, inconsiderable, and destitute
of those immunities which produce security or ex-
cite enterprise. The sciences, on which geo-
graphy and navigation are founded, were not culti-
vated. The accounts of ancient improvements
and discoveries, contained in the Greek and Ro-
man authors, were negleaed or misunderstood.
The knowledge of remote regions was loft, their
situation, their commodities, and almost their
names, were unknown.

jllrcprure course with distant nations from ceasing altogether.

ftruEtive rage. In that city; the knowledge of an- B o0 0
cieritarts and discoveries was preserved; a taste for
splendour and elegance fubfitted; the producaions
and luxuries of foreign countries were in request;
and commerce continued to flourish there, when it
was almost extinct in every other part of Europe.
The citizens of Constantinople did not confine their
trade to the ifands of the Archipelago, or to the
adjacent coasts of Asia; they took a wider range,
and following the course which the ancients had
marked out, imported the commodities of the
East Indies from Alexandria. When Egypt was
torn from the Roman empire by the Arabians, the
industry of the Greeks discovered a new channel,
by which the productions of India might be con-
veyed to Constantinople. They were carried up
the Indus, as far as that great river is navigable;
thence they were transported by land to-the banks
of the river Oxus, and proceeded down its stream
to the Caspian sea. There they entered the Volga,
and failing up it, were carried by land to the Ta-
nais, which conducted them into the Euxine sea,
where veTfels from Conltantinople waited their ar-
rival'. This extraordinary and tedious mode of
conveyance merits attention, not only as a proof of
the violent palion which the inhabitants of Con-
ftantinople had conceived for the luxuries of the
east, and as a specimen of the ardour and ingenu-
ity with which they carried on commerce; but be-

and innDb AT the fame time, A gleam of light and know-

ans. ledge broke in upon the east. The Arabians hav-

ing contracted some reliih for the sciences of the
people whose empire they had contributed to over-
turn, translated the books of several of the Greek
philolophers into their own language. One of the
first was that valuable work of Ptolemy, which I
have already mentioned. The study of geography
became, of consequence, an early object of atten-
tion to the Arabians. But that acute and ingeni-
ous people cultivated chiefly the speculative and
scientific parts of geography. In order to ascertain
the figure and dimensions of the terrefirial globe,
they applied the principles of geometry, they had
rscourle to atlronomical obiervations, they em-
ployed experiments and operations, which Europe,
in more enlightened times, has been proud to
adopt and to imitate. At that period, however,
the fame of the im,)rovements made by the Ara-
bians did not reach Europe. The knowledge of
their difco'vcries was reserved for ages capable of
comprehending and of perfecting them.

in some measure repaired. The rude tribes which B 0 0 K
fettled there, acquiring insensibly some idea of re- a
gular government, and some relish for the func-
tions and comforts of civil life, Europe began to
awake from its torpid and unaftive state. The
first symptoms of revival were discerned in Italy.
The northern tribes which took poffefiion of this
country, made progress in improvement with great-
er rapidity than the people ftttled in other parts of
Europe. Various causes, which it is not the ob-
ject of this work to enumerate or explain, concur-
red in restoring liberty and independence to the
cities of Italyk. The acquisition of there roused
industry, and gave motion and vigour to all the
active powers of the human mind. Foreign com-
merce revived, navigation was attended to and im-
proved. Constantinople became the chief mart to
which the Italians resorted. There they not only
met with a favourable reception, but obtained
such mercantile privileges as enabled them to carry
on trade with great advantage. They were sup-
plied both with the precious commodities of the
east, and with many curious manufactures, the
produ&t of ancient arts and ingenuity, which still
fubfitled among the Greeks. As the labour and
expence of conveying the producifons of India to
Constantinople by that long and indirelt course
which I have detcril)ed, rendered them extremely
rare, and of an exorbitant price, the induflry ot

B 0 0 K the Italians discovered other methods of procuring

I.
'----1 them in greater abundance, and at an easier rate.

They sometimes purchaifd them in Aleppo, Tri-
poli, and other ports on the coast of Syria, to
which they were brought by a route not unknown
to the ancients. They were conveyed from India by
sea, up the Persian Gulf, and ascending the Eu-
phrates and Tigris, as far as Bagdat, were carried
by land acrors the Desert to Palmyra, and from
thence to the towns on the Mediterranean. But
from the length of the journey, and the dangers to
which the caravans were expoled, this proved al-
ways a tedious, and often a precarious mode of
conveyance. At length, the Soldans of Egypt,
having renewed the commerce with India in its
ancient channel, by the Arabian Gulf, the Italian
merchants, notwithflanding the violent antipathy
to each other with which Christians and the follow-
ers of Mahomet were then possessed, repaired to
Alexandria, and enduring, from the love of gain,
the insolence and exactions of the Mahometans,
established a lucrative trade in that port. From
that period, the commercial spirit of Italy became
active and enterpriling. Venice, Genoa, Pisa, rose
from inconfidlerable towns, to be populous and
wealthy cities. Their naval power increased; their
verl:ls frequented not only all the ports in the Me-
clit:crlln(;n, but venturing sometimes beyond the
tSucilitr, viiited the Maritime towns of Spain,
I"rance, lhe ,Low Countries, and England; and,

their career of improvement, an event happened, vottrc, by
the molt extraordinary perhaps in the hillory of jfac','
mankind, which, inflead of recarding the com-
mercial progress of the Italians, rendered it more
rapid. The martial fpiric of the Europeans,
heightened and inflamed by religious zeal, prompt-
ed them to deliver the Holy Land from t. domi-
nion of infidels. Vast armies, composed of all the
nations in Europe, marched towards Aria, upon
this wild enterprile. The Grnoele, the Pilans, and
Venetians furnished the tranfportos which carried
them thither. They supplied them with provi-
sions and military stores. Belide the immense fums
which they received on this account, they obtained
commercial privilcges and eilablinhmenrts, of great

made in il',ltine, and in other provinces of Aria.

B OO K Italy was not the only country in which the Cru-

v-i fades contributed to revive and diffufc such a Ipirit

as prepared Europe for future difcovcries. By
their expeditions into Asia, the other European
nations became well acquainted with remote re-
gions, which formerly they knew only by name, or
by the reports of ignorant and credulous pilgrims,
They had an opportunity of obfcrving the manners,
the arts, and the accommodations of people more
polished than themlelves. This intercourse be-
tween the east and weflt ub(ifled almolt two cen-
turies. The adventurers, who returned from Asia,
communicated to their countrymen the ideas which
they had acquired, and the habits of life they had
contraded by visiting more refined nations. The
Europeans began to be sensible of wants with
which they were formerly unacquainted; new de-
fires were excited; and liuch a talte for the com-
modities and arts of other countries gradually
spread among them, that they not only encouraged
the resort of foreigners to their harbours, but be-

plying to commerce themlelves "'

from profpefts of commercial advantage, or fron
motives of mere curiosity. Benjamin, a Jew of
Tudela, in the kingdom of Navarre, poflicled
with a fuDerftitious veneration for the law of Mo-
fes, and lolicirous to visit his countrymen in the
eafr, whom he hlped to find in such a state of
power and opulence as might redound to the ho-
nour of his fct, set out from Spain in the year
li60, and travelling by land to Constantinople,
proceeded through the countries to the north of
the Euxine and Carpian seas, as far as Chinese
Tarrary. From tlence he took his ruute towards
the south, and after traversing various provinces of
the farther India, he embarked on the Indian ocean,
visited several of its illands, and returned at the
end of thirteen years, by the way of Egypt, to
Europe, with i'uch infbrmatiun concerning a large
di(trist of the globe, altorzether unknown at that
time to the weitc-rn world ". The zeal of the head
of the Chliilliarl church co-operated with the 1ii-
pertition of Benjamin the Jew, in dilcovering the
interiour and remote provinces of Alia. All
Chriflendom having been alarmed with ac-
counts of the rapid progrcls of the Tartar arms

head of a minion of Franciscan monks, and father
Afcolino, at the head of another of Dominicans, to
exhort Kayuk Khan, the grandson ofZengis, who
was then at the head of the Tartar empire, to em-
brace the Chrlftian faith, and to defiLt from defo-
laring the earth by his arms. The haughty de-
fcendant of the greatest conqueror Aria had ever
beheld, astonished at this strange mandate from an
Italian priest, whose name and jurisdiction were
alike unknown to him, received it with the con-
tempt which it merited, though he difiniiFed the
mendicants who delivered it with impunity. But
as they had penetrated into the country by differ-
ent routes, and foiluwed for tome time the Tar-
tar camps, which were always in motion, they had
an opportunity of visiting a great part of Asia.
Carpini, who proceeded by the way of Poland and
Rufiia, travelled through its northern provinces as
fir as the extremities of Thibet. Afcolino, who

instantly relolved to fend ambafladors to this illufiri-

their common enemy the Saracens in one quarter,
while he fell upon them in another. As monks
were the only persons in that age who poffeffrc such
a degree of knowledge as qualified them for a le:r-
vice of this kind, he employed in it father Andrew,
a Jacobine, who was followed by father William
de Rubruquis, a Franciscan With refpecqt to the
progress of the former, there is no memorial ex-

ed. He was admitted into the presence of Man-
gu, the third Khan in fucceflion from Zengis, and
made a circuit through the interior parts of Asia,
more extensive than that of any Luropean who
had hitherto exploredl them P.

of Europe and Alia, which the Venetians frequent-

countries, in expectation of opening with them a
comnmercial inzcrcoulire, more ilited to the fan-
guine ideas and hopes of a young adventurer.

As his father had already carried some IEuropean

commodities to tr:e court of the great Chan of the
Tartars, and had disposed of them to advantage,
he retorted thither. Under the protection ot Kub-
lay Chan, the most powerful of all the successors of
Zengis, he continued his mercantile peregrinations
in Asia upwards of twenty-fix years; and during
that time advanced towards the east, far beyond
the utmost boundaries to which any European tra-
veller had ever proceeded. Instead of following
the course of Carpini and Rubruquis, along the
valt unpeopled plains of Tartary, he paled through
the chief trading cities in the more cultivated parts
of Asia, and penetrated to Canmbal, or Peking,
the capital of the great kingdom of Cathay, or
China, subject at that time to the successors of
Zengis. He made more than one voyage on the
Indian ocean, lie traded in many of the islands,
from which Europe had long received lficeries and
other commodities, which it hilld in high ellimation,
tlioi gh unacquainted with the particutlar countries
to which it was indebted for thofi l'rccious produc-
tions ; and lie obtained informaiti;oi concerning Ic-

veral

veral countries, which he did not visit in person, B o. K
particularly the inand Zipangri, probably the fame --
now known-by the name of Japan P. On his re-
turn, he astonished his contemporaries with his de-
scriptions of vast regions, whoie names had never
been heard of in Europe, and with such pompous
accounts of their fertility, their populousness, their
opulence, the variety of their manufactures, and
the extent of their trade, as rose far above the con-
ception of an uninformed age.

ABOUT half a century after Marco Polo, Sir '312,

John Mandeville, an Lnglifiman, encouraged by
his example, visited molt of the countries in the
east which he had described, and, like him, pub-
lifled an account of then q. The narrations of
thole early travellers abound with many wild inco-
herent tales, concerning giants, enchanters, and
monftcrs. But they were not, from that circum-
flance, lcfs acceptable to an ignorant age, which
delighted in what was marvellous. The wonders
which they told, moffly on hearsay, filled the
multitude with admiration. The facts which they
related from their own oblhrvation, attracted the
attention of the more dilcernilig. The former,
which may be confidered as the popular traditions
anil fables of the countries through which they had
pafnTd, were gradually dilregardcd as Europe ad-
vanced in knowledge. The latter, however in-

B 0 o K credible some of them may have appeared in their

- own time, have been confirmed by the obferva-

tions of modern travellers. By means of both,
however, the curiosity of mankind was excited
with refpeft to the remote parts of the earth, their
ideas were enlarged, and they were not only insen-
sibly disposed to attempt new discoveries, but re-
ceived fich information as directed to that par-
ticular course in which these were afterwards
carried on.

and by the WHILE this spirit was gradually forming in
invention of t
themarincrs Europe, a fortunate difcovcry was made, which
compa'. contributed more than all the efforts and ingenuity

of preceding ages, to improve and to extend navi-
gation. That wonderful property of the magnet,
by which it communicates u'ch virtue to a needle
or slender rod of iron, as to point towards the
poles of the earth, was oblerved. The uife which
might be made of this in directing navigation was
immediately perceived. That mofl valuable, but
now familiar inltrument, the marin:rs coipafs, was
formed. When, by means of it, navigators found
that at all seasons, and in every place, they coulti
discover the north and south winlh so much ealc
and accuracy, it became no longer necefTary to
depend merely on the light of the stars and th\
oblfrvation of the sea coast. They gradually
abandoned their ancient timid and lingering courti;
along the flore, ventured boldly into the ocean,
and relying on this new guide, could fleer in

with a security and precision hitherto unknown. -
The compass may be said to have opened to man
the dominion of the sea, and to have put him in
full poffelsion of the earth, by enabling him to visit
every part of it. Flavio Gioia, a citiz-n of Amalfi,
a town of considerable trade in the kingdom of
Naples, was the author of this great discovery,
about the year one thousand three hundred and
two. It hath been often the fate of thole
illustrious benefactors of mankind, who have en-
riched fcienice and improved the arts by their in-
ventions, to derive more repurtaion than benefit
from the happy efforts of their genius. But the
lot of Gioia has been still more cruel; through the
inattention or ignorance of contemporary hifto-
rians, he has been defraudied even of the fame to
which he had Iuch a jult title. We receive from
them no information with refpec& to his profeilion,
his character, the precise time when he made this
important dilcovery, or the accidents and inqui-
ries which lce' to it. The knowledge of this
event, though productive of greater elctIts than
any recorded ini the annals of the human race, is
tranfiitted to us without any of those circum-
stances, which can gratify the curiosity that it
naturally awakens'. But though the ule of the
compass might enalle the Italians to perform the
illort voyages to which they were accuflomed,

with

B ' o K with greater security and expedition, its influence
L---v-- was not so sudden or extensive, as immediately to

render navigation adventurous, and to excite a
spirit of discovery. Many causes combined in pre.
venting this beneficial invention from producing
its full effedt infiantaneoufly. Men relinquish
ancient habits slowly, and with reluctance. They
are averse to new experiments, and venture upon
them with timidity. ' he commercial jealousy of
the Italians, it is probable, laboured to conceal
the happy discovery of their countryman from
other nations. The art of fltering by the com-
pals, with such tkill and accuracy as to inspire a
full confidence in its diretion, was acquired gra-
dually. Sailors, unaccustomed to quit fight of
land, durfl not launch out at once and comnmit
themselves to unknown seas. Accordingly, near
half a century elapsed, from the time of Gioia's
discovery, before navigators ventured into any seas
which they had not been accustomed to frequent.

Some ap- THE firfl appearance of a bolder spirit may be
peiriric of
.bider dated from the voyages of the Spaniards to the
avikat lon; Canary or Fortunate Islands. By what accident

they were led to the discovery of those small iflcs,
which lie near five hundred miles from the Spanifi
coast, and above a hundred and fifty miles fron
the coift of Africa, contemporary writers have
not explained. But about the niddllc of the four-
tcenth century, the people of all the diffrcnit
kingdoms into which Spain was then divide(d,

wecre

were accustomed to make piratical excursions B 00 K
thither, in order to plunder the inhabitants, or to _--
carry them off as slaves. Clement VI. in virtue

B 0 0 K that hardly any memorial of them is to be found
I-_--' in contemporary authors. In a general survey of

the progress of dilcovery, it is sufficient to have
mentioned this event; and leaving it among those
of dubious existence, or of small importance, we
may conclude, that though much additional in-
formation concerning the remote regions of the
Eaf had been received by travellers who visited
them by land, navigation, at the beginning of the
fifteenth century, had not advanced beyond the
slate to which it had attained before the downfal
of the Roman empire.

Sirs reglar AT length the period arrived, when Providence
plan of dif-
covcry decreed that men were to pass the limits within

which they had been so long confined, and open
to themlclves a more ample field wherein to dif-
play their talents, their enterprise, and courage.
The first considerable efforts towards this were not
made by any of the more powerful states of Europe,
or by those who had applied to navigation with the
greatest assiduity and success, The glory of lead-
ing the way in this new career was reserved for

formed by Portugal, one of the fmnalleft and most inconfider-
the Portu- i ,
guefc. able of the l'uropean kingdoms. As the attempts

of the l'ortutuele to acquire the knowledge of
tlhofc p:irts of the globe with which mankind were
then unacquainted, not only improved and ex-
tended the art of navigation, but roul:d such a
spirit of curiority and enterprise, as led to the dif-
covery of the New World, of which I propolc to

write

write the history, it is necessary to take a view of B °0 K
the rife, the progress, and success of their various --v-
naval operations. It was in this school that the
discoverer of America was trained; and unless we
trace the steps by which his inftruftors and guides
advanced, it will be impossible to comprehend the
circumstances which suggested the idea, or facili-
tated the execution of his great design.

VARIOUS circumstances prompted the Portu- C;icunifan-

ce which

guefe to exert their activity in this new direction, ,ed to this.
and enabled them to accomplish undertakings ap-
parently superior to the natural force of their mo-
narchy. The kings of Portugal, having driven
the Moors out of their dominions, had acquired
power, as well as glory, by the luccefs of their
arms against the infidels. By their vicories over
them, they had extended the royal authority be-
yond the narrow limits within which it was origi-
nally circumscribed in Portugal, as well as in
other feudal kingdoms. They had the command
of the national force, could roule it to a& with
united vigour, and, after the expulsion of the
Moors, could employ it without dread of inter-
ruption from any domeflic enemy. By the perl(e-
tual hostilities carried on for levcral centuriles
against the Mahometans, the ma;-ti;l and adver;-
turous spirit which diftinguilh(ed all the iiurl>)i;:n
nations during the middle ages, wvdas imlprJ vc! and
heightened among the l'ortu icle. A fierce civil
war towards the cl:fte of the ibourtcenth century,

VOL. I. E occationed

B 0 O K occasioned by a disputed fuccelfion, augmented

the military ardour of the nation, and formed or
called forth men of such active and daring genius,
as are fit for bold undertakings. The situation of
the kingdom, bounded on every fide by the do-
minions of a more powerful neighbour, did not
afford free scope to the activity of the Portuguese
by land, as the strength of their monarchy was no
match for that of Castile. But Portugal was a
maritime slate, in which there were many commo-
dious harbours; the people had begun to make
iome progress in the knowledge and practice of
navigation; and the sea was open to them, pre-
senting the only field of enterprise in which they
could distinguish themselves.

Virf at- SUCH was the itate of Portugal, and such the
tempt. disposition of the people, when John I. surnamed

the Bastard, obtained secure poffeflion of the
crown by the peace concluded with Castile in the
Year one thousand four hundred and eleven. He
was a prince of great merit, who, by superior
courage and abilities had opened his way to a
throne which of right did not belong to him. He
instantly perceived that it would be impoflible to
preserve public order, or domeflic tranquillity,
without finding tome employment for the reftles
spirit of his fubjtcs. With this view, he assembled
a numerous fleet at Lilbon, compoled of all the
ships that he could fit out in his own kingdom,
and of many hired from foreigners. This great

armament

armament was defined to attack the Moors fettled B 0 0 K
on the coast of Barbary. While it was equipping, -- ---
a few vefTels were appointed to fail along the
weltern shore of Africa bounded by the Atlantic
ocean, and to discover the unknown countries
situated there. From this inconsiderable attempr,
we may date the commencement of that spirit of
discovery which opened the barriers that had so
long shut out mankind from the knowledge of one
half of the terrestrial globe.

AT the time when John sent forth these ships on

this new voyage, the art of navigation was still
very imperfect. Though Africa lay so near to
Portugal, and the fertility of the countries already
known on that continent invited men to explore it
more fully, the Portuguese had never ventured to
fail beyond Cape Non. That promontory, as
its name imports, was hitherto confidered as a
boundary which could not be passed. But the
nations of Europe had now acquired as much
knowledge, as emboldened them to disregard the
prejudices and to correct the errors of their an-
ceftors. The long reign of ignorance, the conRtant
enemy of every curious inquiry, and of every new
undertaking, was approaching to its period. The
light of science began to dawn. The works of
the ancient Greeks and Romans began to be read
with admiration and profit. The Iciences culti-
vated by the Arabians were introduced into LIu-
rope by the Moors fettled in Spain and Portugal,

E 2 and

B o O K and by the Tews, who were very numerous in both
x___ these kingdoms. Geometry, astronomy, and geo-

graphy, the sciences on which the art of naviga-
tion is founded, became objects of studious atten-
tion. The memory of the discoveries made by
the ancients was revived, and the progress of their
navigation and commerce began to be traced.
Some of the causes which have obftrufted the cul-
tivation of science in Portugal, during this cen-
tury and the lafR, did not exilt, or did not operate
in the fame manner, in the fifteenth century';
and the Portuguese, at that period, seem to have
kept pace with other nations on this fide of the
Alps in literary pursuits.
S !,u;cers. As the genius of the age favoured the execution

of that new undertaking, to which the peculiar
ifate of their country invited the Portuguese, it
proved successful. The vessels sent on the disco-
very doubled that formidable Cape, which had
terminated the progress of former navigators, and
proceeded a hundred and sixty miles beyond it,
to Cape Bojador. As its rocky cliffs, which
firetcled a considerable way into the Atlantic,
appeared more dreadful than the promontory
which they had passed, the Portuguese com-
manders durll not attempt to fail round it, but
returned to Lilbon, more satisfied with having
advanced so far, than aflamed at having ventured
no farther.

fed the passion for discovery, which began to arise ---
in Portugal. The extraordinary success of the ry thbe
king's expedition against the Moors of Barbary, diRcor of
added strength to that spirit in the nation, and gvcltdifco-
pushed it on to new undertakings. In order to
render these successful, it was necessary that they ,'5'
Ihould be conducted by a person who possessed
abilities capable of discerning what was attainable,
who enjoyed leisure to form a regular system for
prosecuting discovery, and who was animated with
ardour that would persevere in spite of obRtacles
and repulses. Happily for Portugal, fle found
all thole qualities in Henry duke of Viseo, the
fourth son of king John by Philippa of Lancaller,
fiftcr of Henry iV. king of England. That
prince, in his early youth, having accompanied
his father in his expedition to Barbary, diftin-
guifhc himself by many deeds of valour. To
the martial spirit, which was the characqeriflic of
every man of noble birth at that time, he added
all the accomplilhments of a more enlightened
and polified age. He cultivated the arts and
sciences, which were then unknown and delpilc'd
by perolns of his rank. He applied with peculiar
fondness to the ltudy of grography; and by the
inftruLCion of able masters, as well as by the
accounts of travellers, he early acquired luch
knowledge ot the habitable globe, as difrovere(l
the great probability of finding new and opultnr
countries, by iailing along the co;!ll of Alri,:;.

L Such

B 0 0 K Such an object was formed to awaken the enthu-

._L Tafiafm and ardour of a youthful mind, and he en-

gaged with the utmost zeal to patronize a design
which might prove as beneficial, as it appeared to
be fplenclid and honourable. In order that he
might pursue this great scheme without interrup-
tion, he retired from court immediately after his
return from Africa, and fixed his residence at
Sagres, near Cape St. Vincent, where the prolpect
of the Atlantic ocean invited his thoughts conti-
nually towards his favourite projet, and encou-
raged him to execute it. In this retreat he was
attended by fmn'e of the most learned men in his
country, who aided him in his researches. He
applied for information to the Moors of Bairbary,
who were accustomed to travel by land into the
interior provinces of Africa, in quest of ivory,
gold-duft, and other rich commodities. He con-
fulted the Jews fettled in Portugal. By promitfs,
rewards, and marks of refpe-, he allured into his
service itveral persons, foreigners as well as Por-
tuguele, who were eminent for their fl.ill in navi-
gation. In taking those preparatory steps, the
great abilities rs the prince were itconded by his
privare virtues. I-lis integrity, his affability, his
refp'ct for religion, his zeal for the honour of his
country, engaied perlons of all r.nks to applaud
his (.cfirn, and to favolur tle execution of it. H-is
Icht'lesl were allowed by the gruater part of his
countrymen to proceed neithll r from ambition,
nor tile dclire ol wealth, but to flow from tle
warm ibenevulence of a heart eager to promote the

4 hiappillicl

happiness of mankind, and which justly intitled B0 o K
him to assume a motto for his device, that de- -'-

'cribed the quality, by which he wished to be
distinguished, the talent of doing good,

His first effort, as is usual at the commencement Dirfcvery of

of any new undertaking, was extremely inconfi- P"oto4Sn'
derable. He fitted out a single ship, and giving
the command of it to John Gonzalez Zarco and
Trifian Vaz, two gentlemen of his household, who
voluntarily offered to conduct the enterprise, he
inftruaed them to use their utmost efforts to
double Cape Bojador, and thence to fleer towards
the south. They, according to the mode of na-
vigation which frill prevailed, held their course
along the shore; and by following that direction,
they must have encountered almost insuperable dif-
ficulties in attempting to pass Cape Bojador. But
fortune came in aid to their want of skill, and pre-
vented the voyage from being altogether fruitless.
A sudden squall of wind arose, drove them out to
sea, and when they expected every moment to per
rifh, landed them on an unknown island, which
from their happy escape they named Porlo Santo.
In the infancy of navigation, the discovery of this
small island appeared a matter of such moment,
that they instantly returned to Portugal with the
good tidings, and were received by -Henry with the
applause and honour due to fortunate adventurers.
This faint dawn of fuccels filled a mind ardent in
the pursuit of a favourite object with flch sanguine

E 4 liopes

B o0o K hopes as were sufficient incitements to proceed.
. --- Next year, Henry sent out three ships under the

419. fame commanders, to whom he joined Bartholo-

mew Pereftrello, in order to take poffeflion of the
island which they had discovered. When they be-
gan to fettle in Porto Santo, they observed towards
the south a fixed spot in the horizon, like a small
of Madeira. black cloud. By degrees, they were led to con-

jecture that it might be land, and fleering towards
it, they arrived at a considerable island, uninha-
bited and covered with wood, which on that ac-
count they called Madeira". As it was Henry's
chief object to render his discoveries useful to his
1420. country, he immediately equipped a fleet to carry

a colony of Portuguese to these islands. By his
provident care, they were furnished not only with
the feeds, plants, and domestic animals common
in Europe; but as he foresaw that the warmth of
the climate and fertility of the foil would prove
favourable to the rearing of other productions, he
procured flips of the vine from the island of Cy-
prus, the rich wines of which were then in great
request, and plants of the sugar cane from Sicily,
into which it had been lately introduced. These
throve so prosperously in this new country, that the
benefit of cultivating them was immediately per-
ceived, and the sugar and wine of Madeira quickly

As soon as the advantages derived from this irft DoubleCape

settlement to the weft of the European continent Bojador.
began to be felt, the spirit of discovery appeared
less chimerical, and became more adventurous.
By their voyages to Madeira, the Portuguese were
gradually accustomed to a bolder navigation, and
inltead of creeping servilely along the coast, ven-
tured into the open sea. In consequence of tak-
ing this course, Gilianez, who commanded one of
prince Henry's ships, doubled Cape Bojador, the
boundary of the Portuguele navigation upwards of
twenty years, and which had hitherto been deem-
ed unpaffable. This fuccelsful voyage, which the 143a.
ignorance of the age placed on a level with the
most famous exploits recorded in hillory, opened
a new sphere to navigation,, as it discovered the
vast continent of Africa, still waffed by the At-
lantic ocean, and Itretching towards the fourh.
Part of this was soon explored; the Portugucle Ar'vance
advanced within the tropics, and in the spare of a trop,,s.
few years they discovered the river Senegal, and
all the coast extending from Cape Blanco to Cape
de Verd.

from

B 0 0 K from the works of the ancient mathematicians and

_-v-rs geographers. But, when they began to enter the

torrid zone, the notion which prevailed among the
ancients, that the hear, which reigned perpetually
there, was so excessive as to render it uninhabitable,
deterred them, for tome time, from proceeding.
Their own observations, when they first ventured
into this unknown and formidable region, tended
to confirm the opinion of antiquity concerning the
violent operation of the direc rays of the fun.
As far as the river Senegal, the Portuguese had
found the coast of Africa inhabited by people near-
ly resembling the Moors of Barbary. When they
advanced to the south of that river, the human
form seemed to put on a new appearance. They
beheld men with skins black as ebony, with short
curled hair, flat notes, thick lips, and all the pe-
culiar features which are now known to diftinguifll
the race of negroes. This surprising alteration
they naturally attributed to the influence of heat,
and if they lhould advance nearer to the line, they
began to dread that its effects would be fill more
violent. Those dangers were exaggerated, and
many other objeCtions against attempting farther
discoveries were proposed by some of the grandees,
who, from ignorance, from envy, or from that cold
timid prudence which rejects whatever has the air
of novelty or enterprise, had hitherto condemned
all prince l-lenry's schemes. They represented,
that it was altogether chimerical to expect any ad-
vantage from countries situated in th;t region which
the wildom and experience of antiquity had pro-

nounced!

nounced to be unfit for the habitation of men; B o o K
that their forefathers, satisfied with cultivating the
territory which Providence had allotted them, did
not waste the strength of the kingdom by fruit-
less projects, in quest of new settlements; that
Portugal was already exhausted by the expence of
attempts to discover lands which either did not ex-
ift, or which nature destined to remain unknown;
and was drained of men, who might have been
employed in undertakings attended with mere ce'r-
tain fuccels, and productive of greater bencfit..
But neither their appeal to the authority of the an-
cients, nor their reasonings concerning the interest
of Portugal, made any impression upon the deter-
mined philof(cphic mind of prince Henry. The
discoveries which he had already made convinced
hiin that the ancients had little more than a con-
jectural knowledge of the torrid zone. He was
no less satisfied that the political arguments of his
opponents with relpect to the interclt of Portugal
were malevolent and ill-founded. In those senti-
ments he was ftrenuoifly supported by his brother
Pedro, who governed the kingdom as guardian of
their nephew Alphonlb V. who had succeeded to
the throne during his minority; and inltead of 1438.
slackening his efforts, Henry continued to pursue
his dil'covcrics with freflh ardour.

BuT in order to silence all the murmurs ofoppo- p,p, grant

fition, he endcaivouTred to obtain Lilc lanllion of the '",,,','.l
higlilt authority in favour of his operatins. With .rll. """ it

thllis uv,.

B 0 O K this view, he applied to the Pope, and represented,

--, in pompous terms, the pious and unwearied zeal,

with which he had exerted himself during twenty
years, in discovering unknown countries, the
wretched inhabitants of which were utter Rfrangers
to true religion, wandering in heathen darkness, or
led astray by the delusions of Mahomet. He be-
fought the holy father, to whom, as the vicar of
Chrifi, all the kingdoms of the earth were subject,
to confer on the crown of Portugal a right to all
the countries pofeffed by Infidels, which should
be discovered by the induflry of its fubjeas, and
subdued by the force of its arms. He intreated
him to enjoin all Christian powers, under the high-
eft penalties, not to molest Portugal while engaged
in this laudable enterprise, and to prohibit them
from fettling in any of the countries which the
Portugue!; lhould discover. He promised that,
in all t;ieir expeditions, it should be the chief ob-
ject of his countrymen to spread the knowledge of
the Christian religion, to establish the authority of
the holy fee, and to increase the flock of the uni-
versal pastor. As it was by improving with dex-
terity every favourable conjuncture for acquiring
new powers, that the court of Rome had gradually
extended its usurpations, Eugene IV. the pontiff,
to whom this application was made, eagerly leized
the opportunity which now presented itl-ff. 1ie
infiantly perceived, that by complying with prince
Henry's rcquefl, he might exercile a prerogative
no Ids flattering in its own nature, than likely to

prove

prove beneficial in its consequences. A Bull was B 010 K
accordingly issued, in which, after applauding in '---
the strongest terms the past efforts of the Portu-
guefe, and exhorting them to proceed in that laud-
able career on which they had entered, he grant-
ed them an exclusive right to all the countries
which they Ihould discover, from Cape Non to the
continent of India.

EXTRAVAGANT as this donation, comprehend-

ing such a large portion of the habitable globe,
would now appear even in Catholic countries, no
person in the fifteenth century doubted that the
Pope, in the plenitude of his apostolic power, had
a right to confer it. Prince Henry was soon fen-
fible of the advantages which he derived from this
tranfastion. His schemes were authorised and
fantified by the bull approving of them. The
spirit of discovery was connected with zeal for re-
ligion, which, in that age, was a principle of such
activity and vigour, as to influence the conduct of
nations. All Christian princes were deterred from
intruding into those countries which the lortu-
guele had discovered, or from interrupting the pro-
grefs of their navigation and conquests .

_...-. therto confined, were astonished to behold the

sphere of navigation so suddenly enlarged, and a
profpeEt opened of visiting regions of the globe,
the existence of which was unknown in former
times. The learned and speculative reasoned and
formed theories concerning those unexpected dif-
coveries. The vulgar inquired and wondered;
while enterprising adventurers crouded from every
part of Europe, soliciting prince Henry to employ
them in this honourable service. Many Venetians
and Genoese, in particular, who were, at that
time, superior to all other nations in the science of
naval affairs, entered aboard the Portuguese ships,
and acquired a more perfec and extensive know-
ledge of their profession in that new school of na-
vigation. In emulation of these foreigners, the
Portuguese exerted their own talents. The na-
tion seconded the designs of the prince. Private
1446. merchants formed companies, with a view to search

for unknown countries. The Cape de Verd islands,
which lie off the promontory of that name, were
1449. discovered, and soon after, the isles called Azores.

As the former of these are above three hundred
miles from the African coast, and the latter nine
hundred miles fiom any continent, it is evident,
by their venturing so boldly into the open seas, that
the Portuguele had, by this time, improved great-
ly in the art of navigation.

the operations of the discoverers, and whose pa-
tronage had encouraged and proteced them. Bur
notwithstanding all the advantages which they de-
rived from there, the Portuguese, during his life,
did not advance, in their urmnof progress towards
the south, within five degrees of the equinociial
line; and, after their continued exertions for half
a century, hardly fifteen hundred miles of the coast
of Africa were discovered. To an age acquainted
with the efforts of navigation in its slate of maturity
and improvement, those essays of its early years mutt From ra«
necessarily appear feeble and unflilful. Bur, incon- 43
fiderable as they may be deemed, they were fuffici-
ent to turn the curiosity of the European nations
into a new channel, to excite an enterprising spirit,
and to point the way to future dilcoverics.

ALPHONSO, who possessed the throne of Portu- Th.e prmon

for d'liltvcry

gal at the time of prince Henry's death, was so Iri,,iii,
much engaged in supporting his own prctenfions t,.lc.
to the crown of Caffile, or in carrying on his ex-
peditions againIt the Moors in Barbary, that the
force of his kingdom being exerted in other opera-
tions, he could not 1rofi-clite the dilcovcries in
Africa with ardour. 1le commiitted the condul:

and oppression of a monopoly, the spirit of dif-
covery languithed. It ceased to be a national ob-
jet, and became the concern of a private man,
more attentive to his own gain, than to the glory
of his country. Some progress, however, was
.471. made. The Portuguese ventured at length to

cross the line, and, to their astonishment, found
that region of the torrid zone, which was supposed
to be scorched with intolerable heat, to be not
only habitable, but populous and fertile.

14S!. JOHN II. who succeeded his father Alphonfo,

lRevivcs
with addi- possessed talents capable both of forming and exe-
tional ar-
dour. cuting great designs. As part of his revenues,

while prince, had arisen from duties on the trade
with the newly discovered countries, this naturally
turned his attention towards them, and satisfied
him with refpes to their utility and importance.
In proportion as his knowledge of these countries
extended, the possession of them appeared to be
of greater consequence. While the Portuguese
proceeded along the coast of Africa, from Cape
Non to the river of Senegal, they found all that
extensive tract to be sandy, barren, and thinly in-
habited by a wretched people profefling the Maho-
metan religion, and fubjeEt to the vail empire of
MOI cco. But to the south of that river, the
power and religion of the Mahometans were un-
known. 'The country was divided into fiinl in-

soon discovered that it produced ivory, rich gums,
gold, and other valuable commodities. By the
acquisition of these, commerce was enlarged, and
became more adventurous. Men, animated and
rendered active by the certain prospect of gain,
purlifed discovery with greater eagerness, than
when they were excited only by curiosity and
hope.

THIS spirit derived no small reinforcement of I's progr-r,.

vigour from the countenance of such a monarch as
John. Declaring himself the patron of every at-
tempt towards dilcovery, he promoted it with all
the ardour of his grand-uncle prince Henry, and 1484.
with superior power. The effects of this were im-
mediacely felt. A powerful fleet was fitted out,
which, after dilcovering the kingdoms of Benin
and Congo, advanced above fifteen hundred miles
beyond the line, and the Portuguele, for the first
time, beheld a new heaven, and oblcrved the stars
of another hemilphere. John was not only solicitous
to discover, but attentive to lecure the poflfiAion of
those countries. 1-le built forts on the co.lt of
Guinea; he sent out colonies to fettle there; he
etlabliflled a commercial intercourec with the more

Others were compelled to do so by force of arms.
A regular and well digested system was formed
with refpeca to this new objet of policy, and by
firmly adhering to it, the 'ortuguefe power and
commerce in Africa were established upon a solid
foundation.

inTps of By their conflant intercourse with the people of

received from the natives, added to what they
had observed in their own voyages, began to open
profplects more extensive, and to fuggelt the idea
of schemes more important, than thole which had
hitherto allured and occupied them. They bad
detected the error of the ancients concerning the
nature of the torrid zone. They found, as they
proceeded southwards, that the continent of Africa,

deemed fabulous, and led them to conceive hopes '---"
that by following the fame route, they might ar-
rive at the East Indies, and engross that commerce,
which has been the lource of wealth and power to

genius of prince Henry, as we may conjecture
from the words of the pope's bull, had early
formed some idea of this navigation. All the
Portuguele pilots and mathematicians now con-
curred in reprefening it as practicable. The king
entered with warmth into their sentiments, and
began to concert measures for this arduous and
important voyage.

BEFORE his preparations for this expedition Schemes for

Africa, that various nations along the coafl had
mentioned a mighty kingdom situated on their
continent, at a great diltance towards the east, the
king of which, according to their description,
professed the Chrillian religion. The Portuguese
monarch immediately concluded, that this muff
be the emperor of Abyssinia, to whom the Euro-
peans, seduced by a miflake of Rubruquis, Marco
Polo, and other travellers to the eatt, ablurdly
gave the name Prester or Preflyter John; and as
he hoped to receive information and affiltancc
from a Chriltian prince, in prolecuting a fchenie
that tended to propagate their common faith, he
resolved to open, if pofible, ionme intcrcourle

who were perfeft masters of the Arabic language,
and sent them into the east, to search for the refi-
dence of this unknown potentate, and to make
him proffers of friendship. They had it in charge
likewise, to procure whatever intelligence the na-
tions which they visited could supply, with respect
to the trade of India, and the course of navigation
to that continent b.

most arduous and important which the Portuguese
had ever projected, was committed to Bartholo-
mew Diaz, an officer whose sagacity, experience,
and fortitude, rendered him equal to the under-
taking. He firetched boldly towards the foutli,
and proceeding beyond the utmost limits to which
his countrymen had hitherto advanced, discovered
near a thousand miles of a new country. Neither

cession of violent tempests in unknown leas, and
by the frequent mutinies of his crew, nor tile

cnterprife. In recompence of his labours and per- '----'
Jeverance, he at last delcried that lofty promon-
tory which bounds Africa to the south. But to
descry it, was all that he had in his power to ac-
complifh. The violence of the winds, the fiattered
condition of his ships, and the turbulent spirit of
his sailors, compelled him to return, after a
voyage of sixteen months, in which he dilcovercd
a far greater extent of country than any former
navigator. Diaz had called the promontory which
terminated his voyage Cabo TcrmentloJ, or the
stormy Cape; but the king, his malter, as he
now entertained no doubt of having found the
long desired route to India, gave it a name more
inviting, and of better omen, The Cape of Good
-Hope c.

THOSE sanguine expectations of success were Mnrro cr-

confirmed by the intelligence which John received fitl.'i'f,'
over land, in coniequence of his embafly to Abyf- l"ucccl
finia. Covillam and Payva, in obedience to their
mater's inftruclions, had repaired to Grand Cairo.
From that city, they travelled along with a cara-
van of Egyptian merchants, and emnbarking on
the Red Sea, arrived at Aden in Arabia. There
they feparatedl; Payva failed direltly towards
Abyflinia; Covillaml embarked for thle L'afl Inldcies,

of rendezvous. Unfortunately the former was
cruelly murdered in Abyflinia, but Covillam
found at Cairo two Portuwuefe Jews, whom John,
whose provident sagacity attended to every circum-
stance that could facilitate the execution of his
schemes, had dilpatched after them, in order to
receive a detail of their proceedings, and to com-
municate to them new inltrutions. By one of
there Jews, Covillam tran!mhitted to Portugal a
journal of his travels by sea and land, his remarks
upon the trade of India, together with exat maps
of the cualfs on which he had touched; and from
what he hiimfelf had oblerved, as well as from the
information of fkiilful feamrn in different countries,

and extraordinary voyage. The courage, however, .--
andt authority of the monarch, gradually dilpelled
the vain fears of his fubjccts, or made it neccffary
to conceal them. As John thought himse!f now

he advanced with rapid proficiency in the itudy of
1,61. them. Thus qualified, he went to sea at the age

of fourteen, and began his career on that clement
which conducted him to so much glory. His
early voyages were to those ports in the Mediter-
ranean which his countrymen the Genoefc frc-
1467. quented. This being a sphere too narrow for his

acive mind, he made an excursion to the northern
seas, and visited the coasts of Iceland, to which
the English and other nations had begun to refir;
on account of its filhery. As navigation, in every
direction, was now become enterprising, he pro-
ceeded beyond that illand, the Thule of the an-
cients, and advanced several degrees within the
polar circle. l-aving satisfied his curiosity by a
voyage which tended more to enlarge hils know-
ledge of naval afFairs, than to improve his fortune,
he entered into the service of a famous lea-captain,
of his own name and family. This man con:-

B 0 0 K of Bartholomew Perefrello, one of the captains

_ y-- employed by prince Henry in his early navigations,

and who, under his proteEtion, had dilcovered
and planted the islands of Porto Santo and Ma-
deira. Columbus got poffelion of the journals
and charts of this experienced navigator, and from
them he learned the course which the Portuguese
had held in making their discoveries, as well as the
various circumstances which guided or encouraged
them in their attempts. The Itudy of these soothed
and inflamed his favourite passion; and while he
contemplated the maps, and read the descriptions
of the new countries which PereLfrello had seen, his
impatience to visit them became irrefifible. In
order to indulge it, he made a voyage to Madeira,
and continued during several years to trade with that
island, with the Canaries, the Azores, the fcttl:-
ments in Guinea, and all the other places which
the Portugutcit had discovered on the continent o'
Africa i.

But, not fatislied with that praile, his ambition
aimed at foire-thilng more. The flccelsful progrels

of curioity and emulation, which set every man of B3 0 0 K
science upon examining all the circumrfances that t.-J
led to the discoveries which they had made, or that
afforded a prospect of succeeding in any new and
bolder undertaking. The mind of Columbus,
naturally inquisitive, capable of deep reflection,
and turned to speculations of this kind, was so
often employed in revolving the principles upon
which tle Portuguefc had founded their schemes of
discovery, and the mode in which thev had carried
them on, that he gradually began to form an idea
of improving upon their plan, and of accomplish
ing discoveries which hitherto they had attempted
in vain.

To find out a passage by sea to the East Indies, He form?

was the great object in view at that period. From theidea of
the time that the Portuguese doubled Cape de courf- to

c' r Indra.

Verd, this was the point at which they aimed in all
their navigations, and, in comparion with it, all
their dilcoveries in Africa appeared inconsiderable.
The fertility and riches of India had been known
for many ages; its spices and other valuable com-
modities were in high request throughout Europe,
and the vast wealth of the Venetians arising from
their having engroill'C this trade, had railed the
envy of all nations. BIut how intent loever the
Portuguese weie !pIlon dileovcring a new route to
thole dedirable rcgioln, they Ltarched for it only
by ileering towards the !iucth, in hopes of arriving
at India, by turling to tli canfl, after they had

- course was Ltill unknown, and, even ifdifcovered,

was of such immense length, that a voyage from
Europe to India must have appeared an undertak-
ing extremely arduous, and of very uncertain ilfue.
More than half a century had been employed in
advancing from Cape Non to the equator; a much
longer space of time might elapse before the more
extensive navigation from that to India could be
accomplished. Thelfe reflections upon the un-
certainty, the danger and tediousness of the course
which the Portuguese were pursuing, naturally led
Columbus to confider whether a florter and more
diret passage to the East Indies might not be found
out. After revolving long and feriouny every cir-
curmfance suggested by his superior knowledge in
the theory as well as practice of navigation, after
comparing attentively the observations of modern
pilots with the hints and conjectures of ancient au-
thors, he at last concluded, that by lailing directly
towards the vwe-f, acrols the Atlantic ocean, new
countries, which probably formed a part of the
vail continent of India, must infallibly be disco-
vcred.

T'rlf ptn- PRINCIPI.Es ;ind aritments of various kinds,
¢illes tm

of the earth was known, and its magnitude alccr-
tained witlh fonm degree of accuracy. From this

it was evident, that the continents of Europe, Asia, B O O K
and Africa, formed but a frnall portion of the ter- ,--
raqueous globe. It was fnitable to our ideas con-
cerning the wisdom and beneficence of the Author
of Nature, to believe that the vast space, still un-
explored, was not covered entirely by a waste un-
profitable ocean, but occupied by countries fit for
the habitation of man. It appeared likewili ex-
tremely probable, that the continent, on this fide
of the globe, was balanced by a proportional quan-
tity of land in the other hemilphere. Thcfe con-
clufions concerning the exitence of another conti-
nent, drawn from the figure and ftru&ture of the
globe, were confirmed by the observations and con-
jectures of modern navigators. A Portuguele pi-
lot, having firetched farther to the weft than was

ficially carved, floating upon the fa ; an:t a, it was

of timber fashioned in the fame manner, and brought
by the aitme wind; and h.id ',fen likewifc canes of

As the force of this united evidence, arising from

theoretical principles and practical observations,
led Columbus to expet ,the discovery of new coun-
tries in the Western Ocean, other reasons induced
him to believe that there mufl be connected with
the continent cf India. Though the ancients had
hardly ever penetrated into India farther than the
banks of the Ganges, yet some Greek authors had
ventured to describe the provinces beyond that
river. As men are prone, and at liberty, to mag-
nify what is remote or unknown, they represented
them as regions of an immense extent. Ctefias
affirmed that India was as large as all the reft of
Asia. Oneficritus, whom Pliny the naturalif fol.
lows % contended that it was equal to a third part
of the habitable earth. Nearchus asserted, that it
would take four months to march in a firaight line
from one extremity of it to the other'. The jour-
nal of Marco Polo, who had proceeded towards the
East far beyond the limits to which any European
had ever advanced, feerned to confirm there exag-
gerated accounts of the ancients. By his magnifi-
cent descriptions of the kingdoms of Cntb, annd

ed by him as lying at no great distance from Spain.
After weighing all these particulars, Columbus, in
whose chara&ter the modefly and diffidence of true
genius was united with the ardent enthusiasm of a
projector, did not reft with such absolute assurance
either upon his own arguments, or upon the autho-
rity of the ancients, as not to consult such of his
contemporaries as were capable of comprehending
the nature of the evidence which he produced in
support of his opinion. As early as the year one

municated his ideas concerning the probability of
discovering new countries, by failing westwards, to
Paul, a physician of Florence, eminent for his
knowledge of cosmography, and who, from the
learning as well as candour which he discovers in
his reply, appears to have been well intiiled to the
confidence which Columbus placed in him. He
warmly approved of the plan, suggested several

plausible and fruitless theory, which might have t--
furnished matter for ingenious discourse, or fanci-
ful conjecture. But with his sanguine and enter-
prifing temper, speculation led dire5ly to action.
Fully satisfied himself with refped to the truth of
his system, he was impatient to bring it to the tell
of experiment, and to set out upon a voyage of dif-
covery. The first ftcp towards this was to secure
the patronage of some of the considerable powers
in Europe, capable of undertaking such an enter-
prise. As long absence had not extinguished the
affection which he bore to his native country, he
wifled that it should reap the fruits of his labours
and invention. With this view, he laid his scheme He appiies
before the senate of Genoa, and making his coun- lthIe Ge.
try the first tender of his service, offered to fail
under the banners of the republic, in quest of the
new regions which he expected to discover. But
Columbus had resided for to many years in foreign
parts, that his countrymen were unacquainted with
his abilities and character; and, though a mari-
time people, they were Ib little accilutomie to clif-
tant voyages, that they could form no jult idea of
the principles on which he founded his hopes of
success. They inconsiderately r jected his prolo-
fal, as the dream of a chimerical projcllor, and
loft for ever the opportunity of rectorir their
commonwealth to its ancient iplendour '.

B 0 0 K HAVING performed what was due to his country,

a Columbus was so little discouraged by the repulse
tofphitga which he had received3 that, inCtead of relinquish-

ing his undertaking, he pursued it with fresh ar-
dour. He made his next overture to John II.
king of Portugal, in whose dominions he had been
long established, and whom he confidered, on that
account, as having the second claim to his service.
Here every circumitance seemed to promise him a
more favourable reception. He applied to a mo-
narch of an enterprising genius, no incompetent
judge in naval affairs, and proud of patronising
every attempt to discover new countries. His sub-
jeds were the most experienced navigators in Eu-
rope, and the least apt to be intimidated either by
the novelty or boldness of any maritime expedition.
In Portugal, the professional skill of Columbus, as
well as his personal good qualities, were thorough-
ly known, and as the former rendered. it probable
that his scheme was not altogether chimerical, the
latter exempted him from the fufpicionof any.fini-
sier intention in proposing it. Accordingly, the
king listened to him in the most gracious manner,
and referred the consideration of his plan to Diego
Ortiz, bithop of Ceuta, and two Jewish physicians,
eminent cofimographers, whom he was accuflomed
to consult in matters of this kind. As in Genoa,
ignorance had, opposed and disappointed Colum-
bus; in Lisbon, he had to combat with prejudice,
an enemy no less formidable. The perlbns, ac-
curding to whose decision his scheme was to be

the Portuguese navigations, and had advised to -
search for a palsage to India, by steering a course
diredEly opposite to that which Columbus recom-
mended as fhorcer and more certain. They could
not, therefore, approve of his proposal, without
submitting to the double mortification, of con-
demning their own theory, and of acknowledging
his superior sagacity. After tearing him with cap- by 'l°om he

tious quetions, and starting innumerable objec-
tions, with a view of betraying him into such a
particular explanation of his fyllem, as might draw
from him a full discovery of its nature, they de-
ferred pafling a final judgment wi.th rcfpce to it.
In the mean time, they conspired to rob him of
the honour and advantages which he expccled fronm
the success of his scheme, advising the king to dif-
patch a vessel, secretly, in order to attempt the
proposed discovery, by following exactly the course
which Columbus seemed to point out. John, for-
getting on this occasion the sentiments becoming a
monarch, meanly adopted this perfidious counsel.
But the pilot, chosen to execute Columbus's plan,
had neither the genius, nor the fortitude of its au-
thor. Contrary winds arose, no fight of approach-
ing land appeared, his courage failed, and he re?
turned to Lisbon, execrating the project as equally
extravagant and dangerous m.

Ohn,rl,,, tn IT was not without reason that Columbus enter-
his f

afions. The Spaniards had hitherto made no es- B 0 0 K
forts to extend navigation beyond its ancient limits,
and had beLeld the amazing progress of discovery
among their neighbours the Portuguese, without
one attempt to imitate or to rival them. The war
with the Infidels afforded an ample field, to the
national acivity and love of glory. Under cir-
cumftances so unfavourable, it was impossible for
Columbus to make rapid progress with a nation,
naturally flow and dilatory in forming all its relb-
lutions. His character, however, was admirably
adapted to that of the people, whose confidence
and protection he solicited. He was grave, though
courteous in his deportment; circumspect in his
words and acions; irreproachable in his morals;
and exemplary in his attention to all the duties and
functions of religion. By qualities so respectable,
he not only gained many private friends, but ac-
quired such general esteem, that, notwithstanding
the plainness of his appearance, suitable to the me-
diocrity of his fortune, he was not confidered as a
mere adventurer, to whom indigence had luggenIed
a visionary project, but was received as a perlon
to whose propositions serious attention was due.

FERDINAND and Isabella, though fully occupied i(i. rcherr.

by their operations against the Moors, paid 10o Iy ,n,,fkIil
imuch regard to Columbus, as to remit the conli- jdl" 'i
deration of his plan to th_ quern's confcffor, Ser-
linand de Talavera. L-le consulted such of his

G 4 countrymen,

B 0 0 K countrymen, as were supposed best qualified to de-

-- cide with refped to a lubjed of this kind. But

true science had, hitherto, made so little progress
in Spain, that the pretended philosophers, felecaed
to judge in a matter of such moment, did not com-
prehend the first principles upon which Colum-
bus founded his conjeaures and hopes. Some of
them, from rniflaken notions concerning the di-
menfions of the globe, contended that a voyage to
those remote parts of the east, which Columbus
expetel to discover, could not be performed in
less than three years. Others concluded, that
either he would find the ocean to be of infinite ex-
tent, according to the opinion of some ancient phi-
lofophers; or, if he Ihould persist in tfeering to-
wards the welt beyond a certain point, that the
convex figure of the globe would prevent his re-
turn, and that he must inevitably perish, in the
vain attempt, to open a communication between
the two opposite hemispheres, which nature had
for ever disjoined. Even without deigning to en-
ter into any particular discussion, many rejeed the
scheme in general, upon the credit of a maxim,
under which the ignorant and unenterprifing fhelcer
themselves in every age, " That it is presumptuous
in any person, to suppose that he alone possesses
knowledge superior to all the reft of mankind unit-
ed." They maintained, that if there were really
any such countries as Columbus pretended, they
could not have remained so long concealed, nor

would

would the wisdom and sagacity of former ages have B ° 1 K
left the glory of this invention to an obscure Ge- A
noele pilot.

IT required all Columbus's patience and address lho makl

an unfa-
to negociate with men capable of advancing such voll.bie

rep.rt con-

strange propositions. He had to contend not only cernng i;.
with the obflinacy of ignorance, but with what is
flill more intractable, the pride of falle knowledge.
After innumerable conferences, and wafting five
years in fruitless endeavours to inform and to fa-
tisfy judges so little capable of deciding with pro-
priety, Talavera, at lafl, made such an unfavour-
able report to Ferdinand and llabella, as induced
them to acquaint Columbus, that until the war
with the Moors should be brought to a period, it
would be imprudent to engage in any new and ex-
pensive enterprise.

WHATEVER care was taken to soften the harsh-

ness of this declaration, Columbus confidered it as
a final rejecion of his proposals. But happily for
mankind, that superiority of genius, which is ca-
pable of forming great and uncommon designs, is
usually accompanied with an ardent cnthuufifmn,
which can neither be cooled by delays, nor damp-
ed by disappointment. Columbus was of this
sanguine temper. Though he felt deeply the
cruel blow given to his hopes, and retired imme-
diately from a courr, where he had been amused
bl long with vain expeflations, his confidence in

tlh

B O OK the jultnefs of his own system did not diminish, and

_.---' his impatience to demonstrate the truth of it by

an aftual experiment became greater than ever.
H-laving courted the protedtion of sovereign states
without success, he applied, next, to persons of
inferior rank, and addressed successively the dukes
of Medina Sidonia, and Medina Cell, who, though
fubjeds, were possescd of power and opulence
more than equal to the enterprise which he projeEt-
ed. I-Is negociations with them proved as fruit-
lers as those in which he had been hitherto en-
gaged; for there noblemen were either as little
convinced by Columbus's arguments as their fu-
periors, or they were afraid of alarming the jea.
loiify, and offending the pride of Ferdinand, by
countenancing a fchleme which he had rejeced "

ot h~s bro-
, rr'inEng- a fuccefiion oi diilppointllents, Columbus had to
lan"d. fullain the additional diftrcts, of having received

no accounts of his brother, whom he had sent to
the court of 'ngland. In his voyage to that
country, lBartholomew had been so unfortunate as
to fall into the hands of pirates, who having firip-
py.d him of every thing, det'.ined him a prilufnc
for icvcral years. At length, he made his elc;le.

gence, that he was obliged to employ himillf

would purchase a decent dress, in which he might -- --'
venture to appear at court. He then laid before
the king the proposals with which he had been
entrusted by his brother, and, notwirhftanding
Henry's excessive caution and parsimony, which
rendered him averse to new or expensive undertak-
ings, he received Columbus's overtures, with more
approbation than any monarch to whom they
had hitherto been presented.

with his brother's fate, and having now ny pro- ,rfp-es of
sped of encouragement in Spain, rfrolved to visit "'.""'i"
the court of England in perlbn, in hopes ot meet spin*,
ing with a more tavourabl- reception there. He
had already made preparations for this purpolc,
and taken measures f;'r the disposal of his children
during his ablcnce, when Juan Perez, the guardian
of the monaflery of Rabida, near Pains, in which
they had bren educated, earnefily folicidcj liim
to defer his i'urney for a short time. Percz was a
man of conficcrable learning, and of lome crdcit

B O knowledge. This investigation satisfied them so

a t, thoroughly, with relpe& to the solidity of the

principles on which Columbus founded his opi-
nion, and the probability of success in executing
the plan which 1ie proposed, that Perez, in order
to prevent his country from being deprived of the
glory and benefit, which must accrue to the pa-
trons of such a grand enterprize, ventured to write
to Isabella, conjuring her to confider the matter
anew, with the attention which it merited.

MOVED by the representations of a person whom

(he refpeaed, Isabella desired Perez to repair im.
mediately to the village of Santa Fe; in which, on
account of the siege of Granada, the court resided
at that time, that she might confer with him upon
this important subje&t. The first effiect of their
1491. interview was a gracious invitation of Columbus

back to court, accompanied with the present of a
fiall fum to equip him for the journey. As there
was now a certain profpe&, that the war with
the Moors would speedily be brought to an happy
issue by the reduction of Granada, which would
leave the nation at liberty to engage in new under-
takings; this, as well as the mark of royal favour,
with which Columbus had been lately honoured,
encouraged his friends to appear with greater con-
fidence than formerly in support of his scheme.
The chief of these, Alonfo de Qu.intanilla,
comptroller of the finances in CaRile, and Luis de
Santangel, receiver of the eccleliaftical revenues in

Aragon,

Aragon3 whose meritorious zeal in promoting'this B 0o K
great design entitles their names to an honourable '-.,
place in history, introduced Columbus to many
persons of high rank, and intererted them warmly
in his behalf.

BUT it was not an easy matter to inspire Ferdi- is n.in

nand with favourable sentiments. He frill regarded
Columbus's proje&t as extravagant and chimerical,
and in order to render the efforts of his partizans
ineffectual, he had the address to employ in this
new negociation with him, Tome of the persons
who had formerly pronounced his scheme to be im-
practicable. To their astonishment, Columbus
appeared before them with the fame confident
hopes of success as formerly, and insisted upon
the fame high recompence. He proposed that
a small fleet should be fitted out, under his conm-
mand, to attempt the difcqvery, and demanded to
be appointed hereditary admiral and viceroy of all
the seas and lands which he mhould discover, and to
have the tenth of the profits arising from themn
fettled irrevocably upon himself and his descend-
ants. At the fame time, he offered to advance
the eighth part of the Ibm necessary for accom-
pliflbing his design, on condition that he flould be
entitled to a proportional fliare of benefit from the
adventure, If the enterprise fliould totally nif-
carry, he made no flipulation for any reward or
emolument whatever. Inflead of viewing this con-
duct as the clearest evidence of his full perluafion

with

B o o K with refpec to the truth of his own system, or be.
v-_,--i ing struck with that magnanimity, which, after so

many delays and repulses, could stoop to nothing
inferior to its original claims, the persons with
whom Columbus treated, began meanly to calcu.
late the expence of the expedition, and the value
of the reward which he demanded. The expence,
moderate as it was, they represented to be too
great for Spain, in the present exhausted state of
its finances. They contended, that the honours
and emoluments claimed by Columbus, were exor-
bitant, even if he should perform the utmost of
what he had promised; and if all his sanguine
hopes should prove illusive, such vast concessions
to an adventurer would be deemed not only incon-
fiderate, but ridiculous. In this imposing garb of
caution and prudence, their opinion appeared so
plausible, and was so warmly supported by Ferdi-
dinand, that Isabella declined giving any counte-
nance to Columbus, and abruptly broke off the
negociation with him which ihe had begun.

THIS was more mortifying to Columbus than

all the disappointments which he had hitherto met
with. The invitation to court from Isabella, like
an unexpected ray of light, had opened such pro-
fpes of success, as encouraged him to hope that
his labours were at an end; but now darkness and
uncertainty returned, and his mind, firm as it
was, could hardly lul)porr the flock of such an
unforeseen rcverfe. lie withdrlew in deep anguifi

poffeflion of a city, the reduction of which extir- Jl9.
pated a foreign power from hle heart of their do-
minions, and rendered them masters of all the
provinces, extending from the bottom of the
Pyrenees to the frontiers of Portugal. As the flow
of spirits which accompanies success elevates the
mind, and renders it eiterprifing, Quintanilla and
Santangel, the vigilant an.i dilcerning patrons of
Columbus, took a dvantage of this favourable situ a-
tion, in order to make one ellort more in behalf of
their friend. They addressed thernCllves to Ilabella,

had always been the munificc:,t patroness of gene-

COLUMBUS had proceeded some leagues on his Ti.e coDnri

journey, when the mefTenger from Ifabelia over- ,r,,.,,nt
took him. Upon receiving an account of the un- "'i SPi'"-
expected revolution in his favour, he returned
directly to Santa ?t, though fume remainder of
diffidence still mingled itfeif with his joy. But
the cordial reception which he met with from Ifa-
bella, together with the near prospect of setting
out upon that voyage which had so long been the
object of his thoughts and wifles, soon effiaced the
remembrance of all that le had funleecr in Spai',
during eight tedious years of solicitation and fuil-
penfe. The negociation now went forward wihl
facility and dipatch, and a treaty or capitulation
with Columbus was signed on thie fevcnres:!th of
April, one tholufand four hundred an!I r:incry-two.

the islands and continents which he should dif-
cover; but if, for the better adminiitration of
affairs, it should hereafter be necessary to establish
a separate governor in any of those countries, they
authorised Columbus to name three persons, of
whom they would chufe one for that office; and
the dignity of viceroy, with all its immunities, was
likewise to be hereditary in the family of Colum-
bus. 3. They granted to Columbus and his heirs
for ever the tenth of the free profits accruing from
the productions and commerce of the countries
which he should discover. 4. They declared, that
if any controversy or law-suit shall arise with re-
spect to any mercantile tranfaEtion in the countries
which should be discovered, it should be deter,
mined by the sole authority of Columbus, or of
judges to be appointed by him. 5. They per-
mitted Columbus to advance one eighth part of
what ihould be expended in preparing for the ex-
pedition, and in carrying on commerce with the
countries which he should discover, and intitled
him, in return, to an eighth part of the profit P.

THOUGH the name of Ferdinand appears con-

joined with that of lfabella in this tranladion, his

resulted

refused to take any part in the enterprise, as king B o0 K
of Aragon. As the whole expence of the expedi- A-_--
tion was to be defrayed by the crown of Castile, 149'.
Isabella reserved for her fubjeets of that kingdom
an exclusive right to all the benefits which might
redound from its success.

As soon as the treaty was signed, Isabella, by Thr prra-

her attention and acRivity in forwarding the pre- his V0a5.o
parations for the voyage, endeavoured to make
some reparation to Columbus for the time which
he had loft in fruitless solicitation. By the twelfth
of May, all that depended upon her was adjulled;
and Columbus waited on the king and queen, in
order to receive their final in[trutions. Every
thing respecting the destination and conduc of
the voyage, they committed implicitly to the dif-
pofal of his prudence. But, that they might avoid
giving any just cause of offence to the king of
Portugal, they ftritly enjoined him not to ap-
proach near to the Portuguese settlements on the
coast of Guinea, nor in any of the other countries
to which the Portuguese claimed right as dilco-
verers. Isabella had ordered the flips, of which
Columbus was to take the command, to be litted
out in the port of Palos, a finall maritime town
in the province of Andalusia. As the guardian
Juan Perez, to whom Columbus had already been
so much indebted, rclided in the neighbourhood (of
this place, he, by the infuence of tlil.t good eccle-
fiaflic, as well as by his o,'n conncxion vwith tile

*--- wanted of the fum tha: lie was bound by treaty to

pany him in the voyage. The chief of t!'efe alTo-
ciates were three brothers ofl the name of Pinzon,
of considerable wealth, and cf great experience in
naval affairs, who were willing to hazard thci':
lives and fortunes in the expedition.

BUT, after all the efforts of Isabella and Co-

luimbuL , the armatrnl.t vwa not suitabl)e either to

l;s ,epr- NEXT morning, being Friday the third day of

S'a'i AugLuft, in the year one thousand four hundred and

ninety-two, Columbus set fail, a little before fun-
rilf, in presence of a val. crowd of lfpecators, who
lent up their supplications to Heaven for the pro-
fperous issue of the voyage, which they wished,
rather than expeted. Columbus fleered dire'ily
for the Canary Illands, and arrived there without
any occurrence that would have deserved notice on
r;4 :;^ any other occasion. But, in a voyage of such ex-

petation and importance, every circumfance was
the object of attention. The rudder of the Pinta
broke loose, the d(ay afrer fie left the harbour, and
thia accident alarmed the crew, no less superstitious
than unfkilf'tl, as a certain omen of the unfortu-
nate deLtiny of the expedition. Even in the short
run to the Canaries, the (hips were found to be lb
crazy and ill appointed, as to be very improper for
a navigation which wa'; cxpriCed to be both long
and langerous. Colunmbhts rlitrttd themr, however,
to the btlt of his powe-r, ;nd having lupplied hi;n-
Iltf with frcfll provisions, he took his departntrc
from Gomnera, or:e of the moil westerly of the Ca-
nary islands, on the sixth day of September.

HEERE the voyage of discovery may properly be B O °: K

said to begin; for Columbus holding his course due t.---'.
weft, left immediately the usual crack of naviga- Th'e9 orfe
tion, and stretched into unfrequented and unknown ,hlch h=
leas. The firlt day, as it was very calm, he made
but little way; but on the second, he loft fight of
the Canaries; and many of the sailors, dejeced
already and dismayed, when they contemplated the
boldness of the undertaking, began to beat their
breasts, and to nsed tears, as if they were never
more to behold land. Columbus comforted them
with assurances of success, and the prospect ofvaft
wealth, in those opulent regions whither he was
conducting them. This early dilcovery of the
spirit of his followers taught Columbus, that he
must prepare to struggle, not only with unavoidable
difficulties which might be expet(ed from the na-
ture of his undertaking, but with such as were
likely to arite from the ignorance and timidity of
the people under his command; and he perceived
that the art of governing the minds of men would
be no less requisite for accomplishing the discoveries
which lie had in view, than naval flill and un-
daunted courage. Happily for himself, and for the
country by which he was employed, he joined to
the ardent temper and inventive genius of a pro-
jector, virtues of another species, which are rarely
united with them. IIe poffeflcd a thorough know-
ledge of mankind, an insinuating addrels, a patient
perseverance in executing any plan, the perfect go-
vernment of his own palions, and the talent of ac-

1-1 4 quiing

B o o K quiring an ascen(dant over thofi of other men. All
L-.- these qualities, which formed him for command,
vigjl.,ne were accompanied with that superior knowledge of
nd' atcf"- his profession, which begets confidence in times of
1'J'lu:. difficulty and danger. To unskilful Spanish fail-

ors, accuflum!i'd only to coalling voyages in the
Mediterranean, the maritime science of Columbus,
the fruit of thirty years experience, improved by
an acquaintance with all the inventions of the Por-
tugueicc, appeared immense. As soon as they pu:
to fca, he regulated every thing by his sole autho-
rity; he iflperintended the execution of every order;
and allowing himself only a few hours for sleep, he
was at all other times upon deck. As his courlc
lay throurh teas which had not formerly been vi-
fited, the founding-line, or instruments for obfer-
vation, were continually in his hands. After the
example of the Portuguese discoverers, he attended
to the motion of tides and currents, watched the
flight of birds, the appearance of rilhes, of sea-
weeds, and of every thing that floated on the waves,
and entered every occurrence, with a minute ex-
actnefs, in the journal which he kept. As the
length of the voyage could not fail of alarming
fLilors ihabituated only to short excursions, Co-
lutnbus cndeavourrd to conceal from theni the reaj

they run eighteen leaigues on the fccond day after

weft ; and as they proceeded, this variation in-
creased. This app:arance, which is now familiar,
though it lt:1l remains one of the myflcries of na-
ture, into the caulti of which the sagacity of man
hath not been able to penetrate, filled the com-
panions of Columbus with terror. T'hey were now
in a boundless unknown ocean, far from the usual
courCre of navigation; nature itself seemed to be
altered, and the only guide which they had left
was about to fail them. Columbus, with no less
quickness than ingenuity, invented a reaoibn for
this appearance, which, though it did not satisfy
himself, stemed so plausible to them, that it dil-
pelled tlheir fears, or li!enced their murmurs.

Lw__ weeds, that it resembled a meadow of vaRf extent;

492k and in some places they were so thick, as to retard

the motion of the vessels. This firange appearance
occasioned new alarm and disquiet. The tailors
imagined that they were now arrived at the utmoit
boundary of the navigable ocean; that these float.
ing weeds would obftruft their farther progrels,
and concealed dangerous rocks, or some large tra&c
of land, which had funk, they knew not how, in
that place. Columbus endeavoured to persuade
them, that what had alarmed, ought rather to have
encouraged them, and was to be confidered as a
sign of approaching land. At the fame time, a
brifl gale arose, and carried them forward. Se-
veral birds were seen hovering about the ship q, and
direEted their flight towards the weft. The de-
fponding crew resumed some degree of spirit, and
began to entertain fresh hopes.

mer navigators had attempted or deemed possible;
all their prognostic. of dilcovery, drawn trom the
fighi of birds and other circumltances, had proved
fallacious; the appearances of land, with which
their own credulity or the artifice of their com-
mander had fiom time to time flattered and amuled
them, had been altogether illulive, and their pro-
fpecl of fuccels feemCnL now to be as diflant as ever.
These rcflecsions occurred often to men, who had
no other object or occupation, than to realon and
discourse concerning the intention and circum-
stances of their expedition. -I hey made im-
prefflon, at firit, upon the ignorant and timid, and
extending, by degrees, to luch as were better in-
formed or more reiolute, the contagion spread at
length from ship to flip. From fccret whispers
or murmurings, they proceeded to open cabals and
public complaints. They taxed their sovereign
with inconsiderate credulity, in p;:ying such regard
to the vain promises and ra!h conjectures of an in-
digent foreigner, as to haz;irJ the lives of so many
of her own fubjecs, in prlcuting a chimerical
chcrne. They affirmed that they had fully per-
formed their duty, by vent-iring fio tir in an un-
known and hopeless course, i;iil coull i:;ur no

fuaded that, upon their return to Spain, tei death
of an unfuccelsful prcjector would excite little con-
cern, and be inquired into with no curiosity.

The addc's COLUMBUS was fully sensible of his perilcls
of Colum-
bus in fituacion. He had obifrved, with great concern,
ioothing
them. the fatal operation of ignorance and of fear in pro-

ducing dialaffction among his crew, and law tha:
it was now ready to burlt out into open mutiny,
He retained, however, perfcct presence of niind,
ple affccted to seem ignorant of their machinations.
I'otwithftanding the agitation and solicitude o' !: i

nance, like a man latislied with the progrels whiuh
he had made, and confident of success. Son'u·

their daflrdlly behaviour, they should defeat this L-\r-_
noble effort to promote the glory of God, and to 492'
exalt the Spanilh nan-e above that of every other
nation. Even with flditious sailors, the words of
a man whomn they had been accuftoned to reve-
rence, were weighty and perfl'uaive, and not only
restrained them from thole violent excesses, which
they meditated, but prevailed wxvil them to ac-
cumpany their admiiiral for fLn, tine longer.

As they proceeded, the indications of approach-

ing land teemedl to be more certain, and excited
hpe in proportion. The birds began to appear
in flocks, making towards the foith-wefl. Co-
i lumbus, in imitation of the Porruguefe navigators,
nwiio had been guided, in levcral of their disco-
vcrie, by the motion of birds, altered his courle
fromi due welt towards th:t quarter whither they
pointed their flight. But, afrer holding on for fe-

ceived that it would be of no avail to have recourse
to any of his former arts, which having been tried
so often, had loft their effcQt; and that it was im-
possible to rekindle any zeal for the success of the
expedition among men, in whose breasts fear had

D;rere of extinguished every generous sentiment. He saw
Columbus,

that it was no less vain to think of employing either
gentle or severe measures, to quell a mutiny so ge-
neral and so violent. It was necessary, on all thele
accounts, to soothe passions which he could no
longer command, and to give way to a torrent too
impetuous to be checked. He promised solemnly
to his men that he would comply with their requef,
provided they would accompany him, and obey his
commands for three days longer, and if, during
that time, land were not discovered, he would

the foil which it brought up indicated land to be t--
at no great ditance. The flocks of birds increased, 149'
and were comrnpoed not only of sea fowl, but of
such land birds as could not be supposed to fly far
from the shore. The crew of the Pinta observed
a cane floating, which seemed to have been newly
cut, and likewise a piece of timber artificially
carved. The tailors aboard the Niina took up
the branch of a tree with red berries, perfeLly
fresh. The clouds around the setting fun assumed
a new appearance; the air was more mild and
warm, and, during night, the wind became une-
qual and variable. From all these tymptoms, Co-
lumbus was so confident of being near land, that
on the evening of the eleventh of October, after
public prayers for fuccels, he ordered the fails to
be furled, and t te hips to lie by, keeping ftrici
watch, lcf'L they should be driven ashore in the
night. During this interval of fufpence and ex-
petation, no man fnut his eyes, all kept upon
deck, gazing intently towards that iquarter where
they expeeicd to (ilcover the land, which had been
so long the objcL of their wiflhcs.

ABOUT two hours before midnight, Columbus i.and di-

ftianding on the forecafile, oblcrvdl a light at a ° r
ditlilnce, and privately pointed it out to Pedro

'_-.c-- midnight, the joyful found of land, land, was heard
149z. from the Pinta, which kept always ahead of thic

other ships. But, having been so often deceived
by fallacious appearances, every man was now b;-
come flow of belief, and waited, in all the angui"i
of uncertainty and impatience, for the return ot

Fridar, day. As soon as morning dawned, all doubts and
oa. zz.

fears were dispelled. From every ship an illand
was seen about two leagues to the north, whose si:
and verdant fields, well stored with wood, and
watered with many rivulets, presented the al)pc:
of a deligthful country. The crew of the Pinta in.
flantiy began 7c Dcnm, as a hymn ofthanklgiving
to God, and were joined lhy thole of the other fii,
with tears of joy and t;:anlorts of congratulat;..,
This office of gratitude to Heaven was followd
by an ac of jultice to their commander. They
threw then-,i-lves at the feet of Columbus, wiatl
feelings of Ielf-condemination mingled with re-et
rence. They implored him to pardon their igno-
rance, incredulity, and insolence, which !i;i
created him fit much unlnecefiry dilq uier, and had
so often obftruect(cd the prorecution ofl hiis wrll conI

As soon as the fun arose, all their boats were Firfinre--

manned and armed. They rowed towards the e nA'ti .
island with their colours dil'played, with warlike
music, and other martial pomp. As they ap-
proached the coafi, they saw it covered with a
multitude of people, whom the novelty of the
ipeicacle had drawn together, whose attitudes and
gelltres expressed wonder and altonifllment at the
strange objets which presented themselves to their
view. Columbus was the first European who set
foot in the New World which he had discovered.
He landed in a rich dress, and with a naked sword
in his hand. His men followed, and kneeling
down, they all kifled the ground which they had
so long desired to fee. They next erected a cruci-
fix, and proftrating themfelvcs before it, returned
thanks to God for conducling their voyage to fucl
an happy issue. They then took solemn poflneion
of the country for the crown of Caffile and Leon,
with all the formalities which the Porruguefe were
accustomed to oblfrve in alts of this kina, in their
new dilcoveries '.

L_-.--. the consequences. The drels of the Spaniards, the

1492. whiteness of their flins, their beards, their arin,

appeared itrange and surprising. The vafn ma-
chines in which they had traversed the ocean, that
'cemred to move upon the waters with wings, and
uttered a dreadful found resembling thunder, ac-
companied with lightning and fmno!e, firuck thern
with such terror, that they began to refpe& their
new guefls as a superior order of beings, and con-
cluded that they were children of the Sun, who had
lefcended to vifir the earth.

T'HE Europeans were hardly less amazed at the

scene now before them. Every herb, and Ihrub,
and tree, was different from those which flourished
in Europe. The foil seemed to be rich, but bore
few marks of cultivation. The climate, even to
Spaniards, felt warm, though extremely delight-
ful. The inhabitants appeared in the simple in-
nocence of nature, entirely naked. Their black
hair, long and uncurled, floated upon their fhoul.
ders, or was bound in tresses around their headls.
They had no beards, and every part of their bo-
dies was pcrfctily sm!ooth. Their complexion was
of a dufly copper colour, their features singular,
rather than dilagreeable, their afpc(& gentle and
timid. Though not tall, they were well fliapl)c
and aceive. Their faces, and tvcral parts of tlleir
body, were fantaflically painted with glaring co-
lours. They were flly at firll through lear, but

glals beads, or other baubles, in return for which .'4z.
they gave such provisions as they had, and some
cotton yarn, the only conmmodity of value that they
could produce. Towards evening, Columbus re-
turned to his ships, accompanied by many of the
islanders in their boars, wlich they called canoes,
and though rutlely formcd orjt of the trunk of a
tingle tree, they rowed them with surprising dex-
terity. Thus, in the firlt interview between the
inhabitants of the old and new worlds, every thing
was conduSled amicably, and to their mutual
fatisfacdion. The former, enlightened aRd ambi-
tious, formed already vast ideas with respect to the
advantages which they might derive from the re-
gions that began to open to their view. The latter,
simple and undifcerning, had no foresight of the
calamities and delcolation which w.re approaching
their country.

Proceeds COLUMBUS employed the next day in vifitin-
towards the
outh[.e the coasts of the ifand; and from the universal

poverty of the inhabitants, he perceived that this
was not the rich country for which he fought.
But, conformably to his theory concerning the
discovery of those regions of Asia which ftretchedc
towards the east, he concluded that San Salvador
was one of the isles which geographers described as
situated in the vast ocean adjacent to India t. Hav-
ing observed that most of the people whom he
had seen wore small plates of gold, by way of
ornament, in their nostrils, he eagerly inquired
where they got that precious metal. They pointe:!
towards the touth, and made him comprehend by
signs, that gold abounded in countries situated in
that quarter. Thither he immediately determined
to diret his course, in full confidence of finding
there those opulent regions which had been the
object of his voyage, and would be a recompence
for all his toils and dangers. He took along with
him seven of the natives of San Salvador, that, by
acquiring the Spanish language, they mihet tfrve
as guides and interpreters; and those innocent
people confidered it as a mark of dillinc.ion wlihe
they were fclected to accompany him.
pDirCOcrI HE saw several islands, and touched at three

of the larget, on which he bestowcd the na.mc ot

St. Mary of the Conception, Fernandina, and B 0 0 K
Isabella. But as their foil, productions, and in- L--
habitants nearly resembled those of San Salvador, '49.
he made no stay in any of them. He inquired
every where for gold, and received uniformly for
answer, that it was brought from the south. He
followed that course, and soon discovered a country
of vast extent, not perfcaly level, like those which
he had already viiited, but so diversified with
rising grounds, hills, rivers, woods, and plains,
that he was uncertain whether it might prove an
island, or part of the continent. The natives of
San Salvador, whom he had on board, called it
Cuba; Columbus gave it the name of Juanna. He
entered the mouth of a large river with his fqua-
dron, and all the inhabitants fled to the moun-
tains as he approached the liore. But as he re-
solved to careen his ships in that place, he sent
some Spaniards, together with one of the people
of San Salvador, to view the interior parts of the
country. They, having advanced above sixty
miles from the lhore, reported, upon their return,
that the foil was richer and more cultivated than
any they had hitherto discovered; that, besides
many scattered cottages, they had found one vil-
lige, containing above a thouland inhabitants;
that the people, though naked, leemeld to be more
intelligent than those of San Salvador, but had
treated them with the fame refpedful attention,
kifling their feet, and honouring them as sacred
beings allied to Heaven ; that they had given them

3 to

B 0 0 K to eat a certain root, the taite of which resembled

L roasted chefnuts, and likewise a singular species of
"92.' corn called maize, which, either when roasted

whole, or ground into meil, was abundantly
palatable; that there seemed to be no four-footed
animals in the country, but a species of dogs
which could not bark, and a creatuwe resembling
a rabbit, but of a much finaller size; that they
had oblerved some ornaments of gold among the
people, but of no great value ".

};E..njec- TriESE miffengers had prevailed with some of
,ebCd,"t i. the n itives to accompany them, who informed

Columbus, that the gold of whicl they made
their ornaments was found in Cubanacan. By this
word they meant the middle or inland part of
Cuba; but Columbus, being ignorant of their
language, as well as unaccultomed to their pro-
nunciatis)n, and his thoughts running continually
upon his ,wn theory concerning tile discovery of
the East lnciics, he was led, by the reliemblilnce of
bound, to fuppoic that they spoke of the Great
Khan, and imagined that the opulent kingdom of

lively imprefflon upon his imagination x, he did
not find gold in Iuchi quantity as was sufficient to
lJtisfy either the avarice of his followers, or the
expectations of the court to which he was to re-
| turn. The people of the country, as much afto-

nifhed at his eagerness in quell of gold, as the
Europeans were at their ignorance and simplicity,
pointed towards the ealt, where an island which
they called Hayti was situated, in which that metal
was more abundant than among them. Columbus
ordered his squadron to bend its course thither;
but Martin Alonfo Pinzon, impatient to be the
first who should take pofftclion of the trealures
which this country was fuppoled to contain, quit-
ted his companions, regardless of all the admiral's
signals to flacken fail until they should come up

49' of the island, he entered another harbour, which

he called Conception. Here he was more fortu-
nate; his people overtook a woman who was fly-
ing from them, and after treating her with great
gentlenels, dilfiffed her with a present of such
toys, as they knew were most valued in those re-
gions. The description which the gave to her
countrymen of the humanity and wonderful quali-
ties of the Itrangers; their admiration of the
trinkets, which the shewed with exultation; and
their eagerness to participate of the fame favours;
removed all their fears, and induced many of them
to repair to the harbour. The strange objicts
which they beheld, and the baubles which Co-
lumbus beflowed upon them, amply gratified their
curiosity and their wifles. They ntarly resembled
the people of Guanahani and Cuba. They were
naked like them, ignorant, and simple and
seemed to be equally unacquainted with all the
arts which appear most necessary in polished focie-
ties; but they were gentle, credulous, and timid,
to a degree which rendered it easy to acquire the
ascendant over them, especially as their excessive
admiration led them into the fame error with the
people of the other islands, in believing the Spa-
niards to be more tllin mortals, and dele:ended
immnediately fronm I-eaven. They posse'id {old
in greater abundance than their ncighbours, which
they rcaliily exchanged for bells, beads, or pins;

;ill!,

and, in this unequal traffic, both parties were B o1 K
highly pleated, each confidering themielves as _---
gainers by the tranfation. Here Columbus was 591'
visited by a prince or cazique of the country. He
appeared with all the pomp known among a simple
people, being carried in a fort of palanquin upon
the Ihoulders of four men, and attended by many
of his fubjets, who served him with great refpec.
1-is deportment was grave and stately, very re-
served towards his own people, but with Columbus
and the Spaniards extremely courteous. He gave
the admiral some thin plates of gold, and a girdle
of curious workmanflip, receiving in return presents
cf small value, but highly acceptable to him '.

COLUMBUS, still intent on discovering the mines

vwliich yielded gold, continued to interrogate all
the natives with whom he had any intercourse con-
cerning their situation. They concurred in point-
ing out a mountainous country, whicli they called
Cibao, at some dilance from the sea, and farther
towards the east. Struck with this Ibund, wlich
appeared to him the fame with Cipao, the name
by which Marco Polo, and other travellers to the
cast, difinguifhcd the islands of Japan, he no longer

lence of the flock awakened Columbus. He ran -
up to the deck. There, all was contusion and '49z
despair. He alone retained preience of mind. He
ordered tome of the sailors to take a boat, and
carry out an anchor astern; but, inflcad of obey-
ing, they made off towards the Nigna, which was
about half a league diftart. He then com-
nmanded the masts to be cut down, in order to
lighten the ship; but all his endeavours were too
late; the velfel opened near the keel, and filled so
salt with water, that its loss was inevitable. The
Imoithnefs of the sea, and the timely aiTiltance of
boats from the Nigna, enabled the crew to save
their lives. As toon as the islanders heard of this
dilafter, they crowded to the imore, with their
prince Guacanahari at their head. InfIcad of tak-
ing advantage of the distress in which they beheld
the Spaniards, to attempt any thing to their detri-
ment, they lamented their misfortune witli tears of
linctre condulance. Not fltisfied with this unavail-
ing expression of their sympathy, they put to lea a
vast number of canoes, and, untdr direction of
jthe Spaniards, aflired in saving whatever could

they might learn the language of the natives, fIudy --

try, search for mines, prepare for the commodious
ftttlement of the colony, with which he purposed
to return, and thus secure and fa.cilitate the acqui-
fition of those advantages which he expected from
his discoveries. When he mentioned this to his
n;en, all approved of the design; and from impa-
tience under the fatigue of a long voyage, from
the levity natural to sailors, or from the hopes of
amassing valf wealth in a country which afforded
'uch promising specimens of its riches, many
of'ered voluntarily to be among the number of
t;iile who thould remain.

NOTHING was now wanting towards the execu- obti,;i ir;

:ion of this scheme, but to obtain the consent of c;nis'..
Guacanahari; and his unfufpicious simplicity soon
presented to the admiral a favourable opportunity
of proposing it. Columbus having, in the best
manner he could, by broken words and signs, ex-
prc-fed some curiosity to know the catile which had
moved the illanders to fly with sUch precipitation
upon the approach of lis ships, the caziquc in-

merous, durst not face in battle, they had recourse
to their ulual method of securing their safety, by
flying into the thickest and molt impenetrable
woods. Guacanahari, while speaking of thole
dreadful invaders, discovered Iuch symptoms of
terror, as well as such conicioufnefs of the inability
of his own people to refill them, as led Columbis
to conclude that he would not be alarmed at the
proposition of any scheme which afforded him the
prospect of an additional security against their
attacks. He initantly offered him the amfifrance
of the Spaniards to repel his enemies; he engaged
to take him and his people under the protection of
the powerful monarch whom he served, and offered
to leave in the island such a number of his men, as
should be sufficient, not only to defend the inhl-
bitants from future incursions, but to avenge their
pall wrongs.
Buidis a THE credulous prince closed eagerly with the

propolal, and thought himlelf already lase under
the patronage of beings sprung from Heaven, and
fuloerior in power to mo' tal men. The ground
was marked out for a Imall fort, which Coluni-
bus called Navidad, becaule he had landed tlere
on Chrifimas day. A declp ditch was drawn around
it. The ramparts were fortified with pallilitdec,
and the great guns, saved out of the admir-;l's

rni^,

thip, were planted upon them. In ten days the B °0 K
work was finifhled; that simple race of men la- ---
bouring with inconsiderate assiduity in crecting this '49'
first rtionument of their own servitude. During
this time Columbus, by his careifes and liberality,
laboured to increase the high opinion which the
natives entertained of the Spaniards. But while
he endeavoured to inspire them with confidence in
their disposition to do good, he wishld likewile to
give them some firiking idea of their power to
I:pnifh and destroy such as were the objects of their
indignation. With this view, in prcftence of a vast
aftcmbly, he drew up his men in order of battle,
and made an ostentatious but innocent display of
the flarpnefs of the Spanish swords, of the force
of their spears, and the operation of their cross-
bows. Thele rude people, strangers to the uie of
iron, and unacquainted with any hostile weapons,
but arrows of reeds pointed with the bones of
filhes, wooden swords, and javelins hardened in
the fire, wondered and trembled. Before this fur-
prise or fear had time to abate, lie ordered the
great guns to be fired. The sudden explosion
firuck them with filch terror, that they fell flat to
the ground, covering their facts with their hands ;
and when they beheld the afloilhing clltcct of the
bullets among the trees, tow.irds which the cannon
ha(l been pointed, they concluded that it was 11i-
pofnible to rfcilt men, who had the colnmand of

and gave names to most of the harbours on the '493'
northern coast of the island. On the sixth, he de-
fcried the Pinta, and soon came up with her, after
a reparation of more than fix weeks. Pinzon en-
deavoured to jultify his condudt, by pretending
that he had been driven from his course by stress
of weather, and prevented from returning by con-
trary winds. The admiral, though he still sus-
pested his perfidious intentions, and knew well
what he urged in his own defence to be frivolous
as well as false, was so sensible that this was not a
proper rime for venturing upon any high strain of
authority, and felt such satisfaction in this junction
with his contort, which delivered him from many
disquieting apprehensions, that, lame as Pinzon's
apology was, he admitted of it without difficulty,
and restored him to favour. During his abfcnce
from the admiral, Pinzon had visited several har-
bours in the island, had acquired some gold by
trafficking with the natives, but had made no dif-
covery of any importance.

FROM the condition of his Ihips, as well as the Rrfltl to

temper of his men, Colunibus now found it neelf- Furul.
fary to haften his return to Europe. The former,
having suffered much during a voyage of foch an
unusual length, were extremely leaky. 'Th latter

had on board some of the natives, whom he had
taken from the different islands which he discover-
ed; and besides the gold, which was the chief ob-
ject of research, he had colleted specimens of all
the productions which were likely to become sub-
je&s of commerce in the several countries, as well
as many unknown birds, and other natural curio.

learned, or excite the wonder of the people. The
voyage was prosperous to the fourteenth of Febru-
ary, and he had advanced near five hundred leagues

rife, and continued to blow with increasing rage,
which terminated in a furious hurricane. Every
expedient that the naval skill and experience of
Columbus could devise was employed, in order to
save the ships. But it was impofible to withstand
the violence of the storm, and as they were still
far from any land, deftruftion seemed inevitable.
The tailors had recourse to prayers to Almighty
God, to the invocation of faints, to vows and
charms, to every thing that religion dictates, or
fuperltition suggests, to the affrighted mind of man.
No profpec of deliverance appearing, they aban.
(doned themselves to despair, and expected every
moment to be swallowed up in the waves. Besides
the paflions which naturally agitate and alarm the

human mind in such awful situations, when cer- B O0
tain death, in one of his molt terrible forms, is
before it, Columbus had to endure feelings ofdilf- 493
trefs peculiar to himself. He dreaded that all The eon-

knowledge of the amazing discoveries which he had lurnbs,.
made was now to perish; mankind were to be de-
prived of every benefit that might have been deriv-
ed from the happy success of his schemes, and his
own name would descend to posterity as that of a
rash deluded adventurer, instead of being tranf-
mitted with the honour due to the author and con-
ductor of the molt noble enterprise that had ever
been undertaken. These reflections extinguished
all sense of his own personal danger. LeCs affected
with the loss of life, than solicitous to preserve the
memory of what he had attempted and achieved,
he retired to his cabbin, and wrote, upon parch-
ment, a short account of the voyage which he had
made, of the course which he had taken, of the
situation and riches of the countries which he had
discovered, and of the colony that he had left there.
Having wrapt up this in an oiled cloth, which he
inclosed in a cake of wax, he put it into a cask care-
fully stopped up, and threw it into the sea, in hopes
that Come fortunate accident might preserve a de-
posit of so much importance to the world '.

it. They soon knew it to be St. Mary, one of the
Azores or weRern illes, subjec to the crown of
Portugal. There, after a violent contest with the
governor, in which Columbus displayed no less
ipirit than prudence, he obtained a supply of freflh
provisions, and whatever else he needed. One cir-
cutaftance, however, greatly disquieted him. The
Pinta, of which he had los fight on the first day of
the hurricane, did no.t appear; he dreaded for
fomne tirne that fie had foundered at sea, and that
all her crew lad prifhled : afterwards, his former
ufpicipons recurred, and he became apprehensive
that P-inzon had borne away for Spain, that he
might reach it before him, and by giving the first
account of his discoveries, might obtain fomc Ihare
of his fame.

due to a man who had performed things -o extra-

into his presence, treated him with the highest re-
fpef&, and listened to the account which he gave of
his voyage with admiration mingled with regret.
While Columbus, on his part, enjoyed the latif-
faction of describing the importance of his disco-
veries, and of being now able to prove the foliditv
of his fchernes to those very peribns, who, with an
ignorance disgraceful to themfnlves, and fatal to

that he remained only five days in Lilbon. On s.

when he set out thence upon his voyage. As soon
as his ship was dilcovered approaching the port, all
the inhabitants of Palos ran eagerly to the mhore, in
order to welcome their relations and fellow-citizen;,
and to hear tidings of their voyage. When the

t-- which had been discovered, the effusion of joy was

Z493- general and unbounded. The bells were rung, the

cannon fired; Columbus was received at landing
with royal honours, and all the people, in solemn
procession, accompanied him and his crew to the
church, where they returned thanks to Heaven,
which had so wonderfully conducted and crowned
with success, a voyage of greater length and of
more importance, than had been attempted in any
former age. On the evening of the fame day, he
had the fatisfadion of feeing the Pinta, which the
violence of the tempest had driven far to the north,
enter the harbour.

:s'"re p. THE first care of Columbus was to inform the
t.on.

king and queen, who were then at Barcelona, of
his arrival and success. Ferdinand and Isabella,
no less aftonilhed than delighted with this unex-
pe6ed event, desired Columbus, in terms the molt
refpedtful and flattering, to repair immediately to
court, that from his own mouth, they might re-
ceive a full detail of his extraordinary services and
discoveries. During his journey to Barcelona, the
people crowded from the adjacent country, follow-
ing him every where with admiration and applaule.
His entrance into the city was conducted, by order
of Ferdinand and Isabella, with pomp suitable to
the great event, which added such diflinguifhing
luflie to their reign. The people whom he brought
along with him from the countries which he had

discoverld,

discovered, marched first, and by their singular B °o° K
complexion, the wild peculiarity of their features, '-
an uncouth finery, appeared like men of another 493.
species. Next to them were carried the ornaments
of gold, fashioned by the rude art of the natives,
the grains of gold found in the mountains, and
dust of the fame metal gathered in the rivers. After
these appeared the various commodities of the new-
discovered countries, together with their curious
produtions. Columbus himself closed the pro-
ccflon, and attracted the eyes of all the fpedators,
who gazed with admiration on the extraordinary
man, whose superior sagacity and fortitude had
conducted their countrymen, by a route concealed
from past ages, to the knowledge of a new world.
Ferdinand and Isabella received him clad in their
royal robes, and feated upon a throi;e, under a
magnificent canopy. When he approached they
flood up, and raising him as he kneeled to kifs
their hands, commanded him to take his feat upon
a chair prepared for him, and to give a circum-
ifantial account of his voyage. He delivered it
with a gravity and composure no less luitable to
the disposition of the Spanish nation, than to the
dignity of the audience in which he spoke, and
with that modest simplicity which characterises men
of superior minds; who, satisfied with having per-
formed great actions, court not vain applaule by
an oflentatious display of their exploits. When he
had finished his narration, the king and queen,
kneeling down, offered up solemn thanks to Al-

K 4 mighty

B OO1 K mighty God for the discovery of those new regions,
t-- from which they expected to many advantages to

J493. flow in upon the kingdoms subject to their govern-

ment '. Every mark of honour that gratitude or
admiration could suggest was conferred upon Co-
Jumbus. Letters patent were issued, confirming
to him and to his heirs all the privileges contained
in the capitulation concluded at Santa Fe; his fa-
mily was ennobled; the king and queen, and, as-
ter their example, the courtiers, treated him, on
every occasion, with all the ceremonious refpecl
paid to persons of the hiigheft rank. But what
pleased him mofl, as it gratified his actlive mind,
bent continually upon great objects, was an order
to equip, without delay, an armament of such
force, as might enable him not only to take pol.
feflion of the countries which he had already dill
covered, but to go in search of those more opu-
lent regions, which he still confidently expected to
find '.

great discovery, received the account of it with ad- B 0 0 K
miration andjoy. They spoke of his voyage with LA-
rapture, and congratulated one another upon their 1493'
felicity, in having lived at the period when, by
this extraordinary event, the boundaries of human
knowledge were so much extended, and fuich a new
field of inquiry and obfcrvation opened, as would
lead mankind to a perfect acquaintance with the
flru6ure and produEtions of the habitable globe g.
Various opinions and conjectures were formed con-
cerning the new-found countries, and what division
of the earth they belonged to. Columbus adhered
tenaciously to his original opinion, that they should
be reckoned a part of those vafl regions in Asia,
comprehended under the general name of India.
]This sentiment was confirmed by the observations
which he made concerning the produtions of the
countries he had discovered. Gold was known to
abound in India, and he had met with such pro-
nir ing samples of it in the islands which he visited,
as led him to believe that rich mines of it might be
found. Cotton, another producion of the East
Indlies, was common there. The pimento of the
islands he imagined to be a species of the East In-
lian pepper. 1ie mistook a root, somewhat rc-
fkmbling rhubarb, for that valuable drug, which
was then supposed to be a plant peculiar to the
J.all Indies '. The birds brought home by him
were adorned with the Iamne rich plumage which

frances, not only the Spaniards, but the other na-
tions of Europe, seem to have adopted the opinion
of Columbus. The countries which he had dif-
covered were confidered as a part of India. In
consequence of this notion, the name of Indies is
given to them by Ferdinand and Isabella, in a ra.
tification of their former agreement, which was
granted to Columbus upon his return '. Even as.

which he produced, were so considerable, and the
reports of his companions, delivered frequently
with the exaggeration natural to travellers, so fa-

avarice, neither the length nor danger of the na- B °o KC
vigation intimidated them. Cautious as Ferdinand ---.-
was, and averse to every thing new or adventurous, 1493.
he seems to have catched the fame spirit with his
fubjeEts. Under its influence, preparations for a
second expedition were carried on with a rapidity
unusual in Spain, and to an extent that would be
deemed not inconsiderable in the present age. The
fleet consisted of seventeen ihips, some of which
were of good burden. It had on board fifteen
hundred persons, among whom were many of
noble families, who had served in honourable fta-
tions. The greater part of there being destined to
remain in the country, were furnilhed with every
thing requisite for conquest or settlement, with all
kinds of European domestic animals, with such
feeds and plants as were molt likely to thrive in
the climate of the Weft Indies, with ucenfils and
instruments of every fort, and with such artificers as
might be most useful in an infant colony k.

BUT, formidable and well provided as this fleet The right

made it necelfary to obtain from the Roman pon-
tiff a grant of those territories which they wished
to occupy. The Pope, as the vicar and rcprelent-

9' Alexander VI. a pontiff infamous for every crime

which disgraces humanity, filled the papal throne
at that time. As he was born Ferdinand's fubjett,
and very solicitous to secure the protection of Spain,
in order to facilitate the execution of his ambitious
schemes in favour of his own family, he was ex.
tremely willing to gratify the Spanilh monarchs.
By an ad of liberality which colt him nothing, and
that served to establish the jurisdiction and pretcn.
sions of the papal fee, he granted in full right to
Ferdinand and Isabella all the countries inhabitc
by Infidels, which they had dilcovered, or should
discover; and, in virtue of that power which he
derived from Jesus Christ, he conferred on the
crown of Castile vafi regions, to the poffefion of
which he himself was so far from having any title,
that he was unacquainted with their situation, anti
ignorant even of their exiflence. As it was necefl
fary to prevent this grant from interfering with that
formerly made to the crown of Portugal, he ap-
pointed that a line, supposed to be drawn from pole
to pole, a hundred leagues to the westward of the
Azores, should serve as the limit between them

and to devote themselves to the inftrution of the
natives. The Indians, whom Columbus had
brought along with him, having received some
tincture of Christian knowledge, were baptized
with much solemnity, the king himself, the prince
his son, and the chief persons of his court, stand-
ing as their godfathers. Those first fruits of the

his departure from Gomera, he made land". It
was one of the Caribbee or Leeward islands, to
which he gave the name of Deleada, on account
of the impatience of his crew to discover some part
of the New World. After this he visited fuccef.
fively Dominica, Marigalante, Gaudalupe, Anti.
gua, San Juan de Puerto Rico, and several other
islands scattered in his way as he advanced towards
the north-wett. All these he found to be inhabit-
ed by that fierce race of people whom Guacanahari
had painted in such frightful colours. His defcrip.
tions appeared not to have been exaggerated. The
Spaniards never attempted to land without meeting
with such a reception, as discovered the martial
and daring spirit of the natives; and in their habi.
tations were found relics of those horrid feasts which
they had made upon the bodies of their enemies
taken in war,

them, he rowed instantly to land. All the natives

lumbus perceived so clearly that this was not a "° °o° GK
proper juncture for inquiring into his conduct with --7
scrupulous accuracy, that he rejected the advice of
several of his officers, who urged him to seize the
person of that prince, and to revenge the death of
their countrymen by attacking his fubjees. He
represented to them the necessity of securing the
friendship of some potentate of the country, in
order to facilitate the settlement which they intend-
ed, and the danger of driving the natives to unite
in some desperate attempt against them, by such
an ill-timed and unavailing exercise of rigour. In-
tfead of wafting his time in punishing past wrongs,
he took precautions for preventing any future in-
jury. With this view, he made choice of a fitua-
tion more healthy and commodious than that of
Navidad. He traced out the plan of a town in a
large plain near a spacious bay, and obliging every
person to put his hand to a work on which their
common safety depended, the houses and ramparts

149ij was more insuperable, the laziness, the impatience,

and mutinous dilpofition of his followers. By the
enervating influence of a hot climate, the natural
inactivity of the Spaniards seemed to increase.
Many of them were gentlemen, unaccustomed to
the fatigue of bodily labour, and all had engaged
in the enterprise with the sanguine hopes excited
by the splendid and exaggerated descriptions of
their countrymen who returned from the first
voyage, or by the mistaken opinion of Columbus,
that the country which he had discovered was
either the Cipango of Marco Polo, or the Ophir',
from which Solomon imported those precious comrn
rnodities which suddenly diffused such extraordi.
nary riches through his kingdom. But when, in-
lRead of that golden harvest which they had ex-
peted to reap without toil or pains, the Spaniards
saw that their profpet of wealth was remote as
well as uncertain, and that it could not be attained
but by the flow and persevering efforts of industry,
the disappointment of those chimerical hopes occa-
sioned such dejection of mind as bordered on dc-
fpair, and led to general discontent. In vain did
Columbus endeavour to revive their spirits by
pointing out the fertility of the foil, and exhibit-
ing the specimens of gold daily brought in from
different parts of the island. They had not pa-

tion spread, and a conspiracy was formed, which
might have been fatal to Columbus and the colony.
Happily he discovered it, and seizing the ring-
leaders, punished fonme of them, sent others pri-
foners into Spain, whither he dispatched twelve of
the ships which had served as transports, with an

discontent, Columbus planned several expeditions

the diftrit of Cibao, which was said to yield th6
greatest quantity of gold, and followed him in

expedition, he displayed all the pomp of military
magnificence that he could exhibit, in order to
strike the imagination of the natives. He marched
with colours flying, with martial music, and with
a small body of cavalry that paraded sometimes in
the front and sometimes in the rear. As thofd

- admiration to the Indians, who having no tame
i493' animals therfelves, were unacquainted with that

vast acceflion of power, which man hath acquired
by fubjedting them to his dominion. They sup-
poled them to be rational creatures. They ima-
gined that the horse and the rider formed one ani.
mal, with whose speed they were astonished, and
whose impetuosity and strength they confidered as
irresistible. But while Columbus endeavoured to
inspire the natives with a dread of his power, ht
did not negleEt the arts of gaining their love and
confidence. He adhered fcrupulouflv to the prin.
ciples of integrity and juflice in all his tranfaions
with them, and treated them, on every occasion,
not only with humanity, but with indulgence. The
distriCt of Cibao answered the description given cf
it by the natives. It was mountainous and unculti-
vated, but in every river and brook gold was ga-
thered either in dust or in grains, some of which were
of considerable size. The Indians had never opered
any mines in search of gold. To penetrate into
the bowels of the earth, and to refine the rude ore,
were operations too complicated for their talorts
and indufiry, and they had no such high value ;)ir
gold as to put their ingenuity and invention upon
the firetch in order to obtain it". The finsi!
quantity of that precious metal which they pol-
ftled, was either picked up in the beds of the

rains that fall within the tropics. But, from tholte --.,J
indications, the Spaniards could no longer doubt 494'
that the country contained rich treasures in its
bowels, of which they hoped soon to be matters ",
In order to secure the command of this valuable
province, Columbus erected a imall fort, to which
he gave the name of St. Thomas, by way of ridi-
cule upon fbme of his incredulous followers, who
would not believe that the country produced gold,
tntil they saw it with their own eyes, and touched
it with their hands ".

afraid of perifling with hunger, and were reduced
already to a scanty allowance. At the ftame time,

among them. Alarmed at the violence and un-
usual symptoms of those maladies, they exclaimed
against Columbus and his companions in the for.
rner voyage, who, by their splendid but deceitful
descriptions of Hispaniola, had allured them to
quit Spain for a barbarous uncultivated land,
where they must either be cut off by famine, or
die of unknown diltempers. Several of the officers
and persons of note, instead of checking, joined in
those seditious complaints. Father Boyl, the apo-
ftolical vicar, was one of the most turbulent and
outrageous. It required all the authority and ad-
dress of Columbus to re-establish subordination and
tranquillity in the colony. Threats and promises
were alternately employed for this purpose; but
nothing contributed more to soothe the malcon-
tents than the profpeat of finding, in the mines of
Cibao, such a rich store of trealure as Would be a

whether they were to be confidered as a separate 1494.

pointed his brother Don Diego, with the afiltance
of a council of officers, to govern the iland in his
absence; and gave the command ,,t a body of fol-
diers to Don Pedro Margarita, with which he was
to visit the different parts of the illand, and endea-
vour to eftablifl the authority or the Spaniards
among the inhabitants. Having left them very
particular inltructions with refpeit ro their con-
duc, he weighed anchor on the 24th of April,
with one ship and two fniall barks under his com-
mand. During a tedious voyage of full five
months, he had a trial of almost all the numerous
hardflips to which persons of his profeflion are ex-
posed, without making any difcovcry of import-
ance, except the island of Jamaica. As he ranged
along the southern coast of Cuba Y, he was entan-
gled in a labyrinth formed by an incredible num-
ber of small illands, to which he gave the name of
the Queen's Garden. In this unknown course,
armong rocks and shelves, he was retarded by con-

alarmed with the terrible thunder and lightning

As long as the Indians had any profpet that

their sufferings might come to a period by the vo.
luntary departure of the invaders, they submitted
in silence, and dissembled their sorrow; but they
now perceived that the yoke would be as perma.
nent as it was intolerable. The Spaniards had
built a town, and surrounded it with ramparts,
They had erected forts in different places. They
had enclosed and sown several fields. It was ap.
parent that they came not to visit the country, bu;
to fettle in it. Though the number of those ftran.
gers was inconsiderable, the slate of cultivation
among this rude people was so imperfec, and in
such exact proportion to their own consumption,
that it was with difficulty they could afford lubfit.

was so indolent and inacive, the warmth of the

by any yigQrous efforts either of body or mind. ,
The Spaniards, though the mo: abftemjous ofal! 949.
the European nations,appeared to them excessively
voracious. One Spaniard consumed as much as
several Indians. This keenness of appetite fur-
prifed them so much, and ieemed to them to be so
insatiable, that they fuppoled the Spaniards had
left their own country, becaule it dia rnot produce
as much as was requisite to gratify their imn: de-
rate desire of tood, and had come among them in
quest of nourifhmeut b. Self-prefervation prompt-
ed them to wish for the departure of guests who
wafted so salt their fiender flock of provisions.
The injuries which they suffered, added to
their impatience for this event. They had long
expected that the Spaniards would retire of their
own accord. They now perceived that, in order
to avert the deftruEtion with which they were
threatened, either by the flow confuniption of fa-
mine, or by the violence of their oppressors, it was
necessary to aflume courage, to attack those for-
midable invaders with united force, and drive them
from the fettienients of which they had violently
taken pofealion.

SucH were the sentiments which universally pre- War wih

vailed among the Indians, when Colunlbus return-
ed to Isabella. Inflamed by the unprovolced out-
rages of the Spaniards, with a degree of rage of

b IIerrera, dec. i. lib. ii. c. 17,

which

0 o o K which their gentle natures, formed to fufier and
iZ.tj frubmit, seemed hardly susceptible, they waited
J494' only for a signal from their leaders to fall upon

the colony. Some of the caziques had already
surprised and cut off fevcral firagglers. The dread
of this impending danger united the Spaniards,
and re-eflablifhed the authority of Columbus, at
they saw no profpe&t of fafery but in committing
themelvcs to his prudent guidance. It was now
necessary to have recourse to arms, the employing
of which against the Indians, Columbus had hi.
therto avoided with the greatest solicitude. Un.
equal as the conflic may seem, between the naked
inhabitants of the New World, armed with clubl,
flicks hardened in the fire, wooden swords, and
arrows pointed with bones or flints; and troops
accustomed to the discipline, and provided with
the inffrunents of deftrustion known in the Euro-
pean art of war, the situation of the Spaniards was
far from being exempt from danger. The vast
superiority of the natives in number, compensatcd
many defects. An handful of men was about to
encounter a whole nation. One adverse event, or
even any unforeseen delay in determining the fate
of the war, might prove fatal to the Spaniards.
Conscious that success depended on the vigour and
rapidity of his operations, Columbus inflantly al:
fembled his forces. They were reduced to a very
small number. Diicafes, engendered by the warmth
and humidity of the country, had raged among
them with much violence; experience hadl not yet

taught them the art either of curing these, or the B 0°° ^
precautions requisite for guarding against them; --
two-thirds of the original adventurers were dead, 494'
and many of those who survived were incapable of
fkrvice '. The body which took the field consist- 149;.
ed only of two hundred foot, twenty horle, and March 24
twenty large dogs; and how strange soever it may
seem, to mention the last as compoting part of a
military force, they were not perhaps the leafl for-
midable and dcftruative of the whole, when em-
ployed against naked and timid Indians. All the
caziques of the island, Guacanahari excepted, who
retained an inviolable attachment to the Spaniards,
were in arms to oppufe Columbus, with forces a-
mounting, if we may b 'ieve the Spanish hiaorianS,
to . hundred thousand r;en. Instead of attempting
to draw the Spaniards into the faflneffes of the
woods and mountains, they were so imprudent as
to take their fiation in the Vega Real, the most
open plain in the country. Columbus did not al-
low them time to perceive their error, or to alter
their position. lHe attacked them during the
night, when undilciplined troops are least capable
of ading with union and concert, and obtained an
easy and bloodless vic&ory. The confiernation
with which the Indians were filled by the noire and
havoc made by the fire-arms, by the impetuous
force of the cavalry, and the fierce onset of the
dogs, was so great, that they threw down their
weapons, and fled without attempting refinance.

which constrained him to depart from his own
system of administration. Several unfavourable

attention for every opportunity of spreading infi. --;
nuations to his detriment. Many of the courtiers 1495
viewed his growing reputation and power with en-
vious eyes. Fonseca, the archdeacon of Seville,
who was intrusted with the chief diretion of Indian
affairs, had conceived such an unfavourable opi-
nion of Columbus, for fbme reason which the con-
temporary writers have not mentioned, that he
listened with partiality to every invective against
him. It was not easy for an unfriended firanger,
unpractised in courtly arts, to counteract the ma-
chinations of fo-many enemies. Columbus fatw
that there was but one method of supporting his
own credit, and of silencing all his adversaries.
He must produce such a quantity of gold, as would
not only justify what he had reported with refpe:
to the richness of the country, but encourage Ser-
dinand and Isabella to persevere in prolecuting his
plans. The necessity of obtaining it, forced him
not only to impose this heavy tax upon the Indians,
but to exact payment of it with extreme rigour;
and may be pleaded in excuse for his deviating on
this occasion from the mildness and humanity
with which he uniformly treated that unhappy
people '.

1495- They were incapable of such a regular and perie-

vering exertion of industry, and felt it such a grie-
vous restraint upon their liberty, that they had re-
course to an expedient for obtaining deliverance
from this yoke, which demonltrates the excess of
their impatience and delpair. They soried a
scheme of ltarving those oppressors whom they
durlt not attempt to expel; and from the opinion
which they entertained with refpedt to the voraci-
ous appetite of the Spaniards, they concluded the
execution of it to be very practicable. With this
view, they suspended all the operations of agricul-
ture; they. sowed no maize, they pulled up the
roots of the manioc which were planted, and re-
tiring to the most inacceflible parts of the moun-
tains, left the uncultivated plains to their enemies.
This desperate resolution produced in some degree
the effels which they expected. The Spaniards
were reduced to extreme want; but they received

rewards, which by his services and fuierrings he
was incirled to enjoy. The hardships unavoidable
in a new fetilcment, the calamities occasioned by
an unhealthy climate, the difafRers attending a
voyage in unknown seas, were all represented as
the fruits of his reflels and inconsiderate ambition.
His prudent attention to prefcrve discipline and
subordination was denominated excess of rigour;
the punishments which he inflid-ed upon the muti-
nous and dilorderly were imputed to cruelty. These
accusations gained such credit in a jealous court,
that a commissioner was appjinted to repair to His-

ployed in functions to which they are not equal.
By listening with eagerness to every accusation
againfl Columbus, and encouraging not only the
malcontent Spaniards, but even the Indians, to
produce their grievances, real or imaginary, he
fomented the spirit of dissention in the island, with-
out establishing any regulation of public utility, or
that tended to redress the many wrongs, with the
odium of which he wished to load the admiral's ad-
ministration. As Columbus felt sensibly how hu-
miliating his situation must be, if he should remain
in the country while such a partial infpecor ob-
served his motions, and controuled hisjurifdition,
he took the resolution of returning to Spain, in or-
der to lay a full account of all his tranfacions, par-
ticularly with refpec to the points in dispute be-
tween him and his adversaries, before Ferdinand
and Isabella, from whose julice and discernment
he expected an equal and a favourable decision.
He committed the administration of affairs, during
1496. his absence, to Don Bartholomew, his brother,

with the title of Adelantado, or Lieutenant-Go-
vernor. By a choice leTs fortunate, and which
proved the source of many calamities to the colony,
he appointed Francis Rollan chief jullicc, wvitl

IN returning to Europe, Columbus held a course B 0 0 K
different from that which he had taken in his for- ---.-

1496.

mer voyage. He steered almost due east from Ret'un'a to
Hispaniola, in the parallel of twenty-two degrees S"ain.
of latitude; as experience had not yet discovered
the more certain and expeditious method of stretch-
ing to the north, in order to fall in with the south-
weft winds. By this ill-advifed choice, which, in
the infancy of navigation between the New and
Old Worlds, can hardly be imputed to the admi-
ral as a defet in naval skill, he was exposed to in-
finite fatigue and danger, in a perpetual firuggle
with the trade-winds, which blow without varia-
tion from the east between the tropics. Notwith-
standing the almost insuperable difficulties of such
a navigation, he persisted in his course with his
usual patience and firmness, but made so little way,
that he was three months without feeing land. At
length, his provisions began to fail, the crew was
reduced to the fcantv allowance of fix ounces of
bread a-day for each person. The admiral fared
no better than the meanest sailor. But, even in
this extreme distress, he retained the humanity
which diifinguifhes his charaser, and refused to
comply with the earnest Iblicitations of his crew,
lome of whom proposed to feed upon the Indian
priloncrs whom they were carrying over, and others
iniilled to throw them over-board, in order to lellcn
the conlumption of their linall flock. 1-le repre-

only of integrity, but of having performed great
services. Ferdinand and Ifabrlla, ashamed of their
own facility in lending too favourable an ear to
frivolous or ill -founded accusations, received him
with such distinguished marks of respect, as co-
vered his enemies with shame. Their censures and
calumnies were no more heard of at that jun&ure.
The gold, the pearls, the cotton, and other comr
modities of value which Columbus produced,
seemed fully to refute what the malcontents had
propagated with refpcet to the poverty of the
country. By reducing the Indians to obedience,
and imposing a regular tax upon them, he had le-
cured to Spain a large acceflion of new fubjccrP,
and the etlabliflnient of a revenue that promiicd
to be confiderhble. By the mines which lie lid

ment had been proposed, the precautions taken for
that purpose had either been insufficient, or were
renJered ineffedual by the mutinous spirit of the
Spaniards, and the uniorclcen calamities arising
from various caulcs. Now a plan was to be form-
ed of a regular colony, that might clrve as a model
in all future eflablilhmnents. Ir.very particular was

professions; and the proportion of each was efta-
blifhed, according to their usefulness and the wants
of the colony. A suitable number of women was
to be chosen to accompany these new settlers. As
it was the first object to raise provisions in a coun-
try where scarcity of food had been the occasion of
so much distress, a considerable body of husband-
men was to be carried over. As the Spaniards had
then no conception of deriving any benefit frum
those produEtions of the New World which have
since yielded such large returns of wealth to Europe,
but had formed magnificent ideas, and entertained
sanguine hopes with refpe& to the riches contained
in the mines which had been discovered, a band of
workmen, flilled in the various arts employed in
digging and refining the precious metals, was pro.
vided. All there emigrants were to receive pay
and fubliftence for some years, at the public ex.
pence k.
A dcfca in THus far the regulations were prudent, and well

adapted to the end in view. But as it was foreseen
that few would engage voluntarily to fettle in a
country, whose noxious climate had been fatal to
so many of their countrymen, Columbus proposed
to transport to lifpaniola such malefactors as had

were of a less atrocious nature ; and that for the -v
future a certain proportion of the offenders usually I496.
sent to the gallies, should be condemned to labour
in the mines which were to be opened. This ad-
vice, given without due reflection, was as inconfi-
derately adopted. The prisons of Spain were
drained, in order to collect members for the in-
tended colony; and the judges were instructed to
recruit it by their future sentences. It is not, how-
ever, with such materials, that the foundations of
a society, defined to be permanent, ffiould be laid.
Industry, sobriety, patience, and mutual confi-
dence are indispensably requisite in an infant fettle-
ment, where purity of morals must contribute more
towards eftablilhing order, than the operation or
authority of laws. But when such a mixture of
what is corrupt is admitted into the original confli-
tution of the political body, the vices of those un-
ibund and incurable members will probably infct:
the whole, and must certainly be productive of vio-
lent and unhappy effects. This the Spaniards
fatally experienced; and the other European na-
tions having successively imitated the pracice of
Spain in this particular, pernicious confcquences
have followed in their settlements, which can be
imputed to no other cause '.

assistance of Fonseca, the minister for Indian affairs,
who was now promoted to the bishopric of Badajos,
they threw in lo many obstacles to protract the pre-

proposed, as the molt certain method of finding

did not greatly mitigate the intenseness of the heat.
The admiral, who with his usual vigilance had in

could perceive the danger, was entangled among
those adverse currents and tenipeftuous waves, and
it was with the utmost difficulty that he escaped
through a narrow strait, which appeared so tre-
mendous, that he called it La Boca del Drago.
As soon as the consternation which this occaioned
permitted him to reflect upon the nature of an ap-
pearance so extraordinary, he discerned in it a
Iource of comfort and hope. He jull ly concluded,
that such a vast body of water as this river con-
tained, could not be supplied by any island, but
must flow through a country of immenle extent,
and of consequence, that he was now arrived at that
continent which it had long been the objtEt of rlis
wilhes to dilcover. Full of this idea, he flood to
the weft along the coast of those provinces which
are now known by the names of l'aria and Cu-

intercourse with the people, who rercmnbled thole
of Hispaniola in their appearance and manner of
life. They wore, as ornaments, finall plates of
gold, and pearls of considerable value, which they
willingly exchanged for European toys. They

MANX

MANY revolutions had happened in that coun- B ° ° K

try during his absence. His brother, the adelan- A
tado, in consequence of an advice which the admi- State9uHif-
ral gave before his departure, had removed the pao,1' r,

his arrival

colony from Isabella to a more commodious flation, thce.
on the oppoite fide of the island, and laid the
foundation of St. Domingo , which was long the
moil confidcrable European town in the New
World, and the feat of the supreme courts in the
Spanish dominions there. As Icon as the Spaniards
were eflablifhed in this new settlement, the adelan-
tado, that they might neither languish in inactivity,
nor have leisure to form new cabals, marched into
those parts of the island which his brother had not
yet visited or reduced to obedience. As the people
were unable to resist, they submitted every where
to the tribute which he imposed. But they loon
found the burden to be so intolerable, that, over-
awed as they were by the superior power of thtir
oppressors, they tool arms against them. Those
infurretions, however, were not formidable. A.
conflic with timid and naked Indians was neither
dangerous nor of doubtful ifnle.

so unbecoming his rank. The arguments which he
employed to seduce his countrymen were frivolous
and ill-founded. He accused Columbus and his
two brothers of arrogance and severity; he pre.
tended that they aimed at trfablifhing an inde-
pendent dominion in the country; he taxed them
with an intention of cutting off part of the Spa-
niards by hunger and fatigue, that they might
more easily reduce the remainder to fubjeaion;
he represented it as unworthy of Caflilians, to re.
main the tame and passive slaves of three Genoese
adventurers. As men have always a propenfityto
impute the hardships, ofwhich they feel the pressure,
to the mifcondu&t of their rulers; as every nation
views with a jealous eye the power and exaltation
of foreigners, Rollan's insinuations made a deep
impreflion on his countrymen. 1lis charadccr an.t
rank added weight to them. A considerable nulm-
ber of the Spaniards made choice of him as their
leader, and taking arms again l the adelantaio
and his brother, seized the king's magazine of pro-
visions, and endeavoured to furprilc the Iort at
St. Domingo. This was prclervcd by the vigi-

yoke ':

SUCH was the diftraaed slate of the colony

when Columbus landed at St. Domingo. He was
astonished to find that the three ihips which he had
dispatched from the Canaries were not yet arrived.
By the unfkilfulnels of the pilots, and the violence
of currents, they had been carried a hundred and
sixty miles to the welt of St. Domingo, and forced
to take shelter in a harbour of the province of
Xaragua, where Roldan and his seditious followers
were cantoned. Roldan carefully concealed from
the commanders of the ships his infurredion against
the adelantado, and employing his utmost address
to gain their confidence, persuaded them to set on
thore a considerable part of the new settlers whom
they brought over, that they might proceed by
land to St. Domingo. It required but few argu-
ments to prevail with those men to espouse his
cause. They were the refuse of the jails of Spain,
to whom idleness, licentioufnes, and deeds of vio-
lence, were familiar; and they returned eagerly to
a course of life nearly reicmbling that to which
they had been accultomed. The comimanders of

promising to re-tftabiifh Roldan in his former _--

and without bloodshed, but after many tedious
negociations, he dissolvcd this dangerous combina-
tion which threatened the colony with ruin; and
rrflored the appearance of order, regular govern-
ment, and tranquillity Y.

IN consequence of this agreement with the mu- Anewmole

tineers, lands were allotted them in dife'rent parts m.n nt,.

rebellion against their superiors, and proposed
several regulations for the better government of

BUT,

BUT, previous to these, events had happened B 110 K

which merit attention, both on account of their
own importance, and their connection with the T-e voyge

of Valco de

history of the New World. While Columbus was Gamatothe
engaged in his fuccefive voyages to the weft, the byt"hec'
spirit of discovery did not languish in Portugal, the f Cood
kingdom where it firll acquired vigour, and be-
came enterprising. Self-condemnation and re-
gret were not the only sentiments to which the
success of Columbus, and refletion upon their
own imprudence in rejeting his proposals, gave
rife among the Portuguese. They excited a gene-
rous emulation to surpass his performances, and an
ardent desire to make tome reparation to their
country for their own error. With this view,
Emmanuel, who inherited the enterprising genius
of his predeceflors, persisted in their grand scheme
of opening a passage to the East Indies by the Cape
of Good Hope; and soon after his accession to the
throne, equipped a fcquadron for that important
voyage. He gave the command of it to Valco de
Gama, a man of noble birth, pofflced of virtue,
prudence, and courage, equal to the station. The
squadron, like all those fitted our for discovery in
the infancy of navigation, was extremely feeble,
confiling only of three vcfecls, of neither burden
nor force adequate to the service. As the Euro-
peans were at that time little acquainted with the
course of the trade-winds and periodical monsoons,
which render navigation in the Arlantic ocean, as
well as in the sea that fipalrates Africa from India,

on the ninth of July, and fianding towards the
south, had to struggle for four months with con-
trary winds, before he could reach the Cape of
Nov, 20. Good Hope. Here their violence began to abate;

and during an interval of calm weather, Gama
doubled that formidable promontory, which had
so long been the boundary of navigation, and di-
rected his course towards the norrh-eaft, along the
African coast. He touched at several ports; and
after various adventures, which the Portuguese
hiitorians relate with high but just encomiums
upon his conduct and intrepidity, he came to an-
chor before the city of Melinda. Throughout all
the vast countries which extend along the coast of
Africa, from the river Senegal to the confines of
Zanguebar, the Portuguese had found a race of
men rude and uncultivated, firangers to letters, to
arts and commerce, and dilfering from the inhabit-
ants of Europe, no less in their features and com-
plexion, than in their manners and institutions. As
they advanced from this, they obfcrved, to their
inexpressible joy, that the human form gradually
altered and improved, the Asiatic features began
to predominate, marks of civilization appeared,
letters were known, the Malometan religion wa$
cflablified, and a conmerce, far from being in-
conildcrable, was carried on. At that time fiveral

vessels from India were in the port of Melinda. B 0

Gama now pursued his voyage with almolt abfjlute -----
certainty of success, and, under the conduct of a 499'
Mahometan pilot, arrived at Calecut, upon the
coast of Malabar, on the twenty-lecond of May
one thousand four hundred and ninety eight. What
he beheld of the wealth, the populousness, the cul-
tivation, the industry and arts of this highly civili-
zed country, far surpassed any idea that he had
formed, fiom the imperfect accounts which the
Europeans had hitherto received of it. But as he
pofTeffed neither sufficient force to attempt a fettle-
menrt, nor proper commoditis with which he could
carry on commerce of any consequence, lie hastened
back to Portugal, with an account of his success
in performing a voyage the longeit, as well as molt
difficult, that had ever been made since the first
invention of navigation. He landed at Lisbon
on the fourteenth of September one thousand four

and five days from the time he left that port '.

greffion, it continued to acquire vigour, and
advanced at length with a rapidity and force which
burfl through all the limits within which ignorance
and fear had hitherto circumscribed the activity of
the human race. Almost fifty years were employed
by the Portuguese in creeping along the coast of
Africa from Cape Non to Cape de Verd, the latter
of which lies only twelve degrees to the south of
the former. In less than thirty years they ventured
beyond the equinoftial line into another hemi-
sphere, and penetrated to the southern extremity
of Africa, at the diStance of forty-nine degrees
from Cape de Verd. During the last seven years
of the century, a New World was discovered in
the weft, not inferior in extent to all the parts of
the earth with which mankind were at that time
acquainted. In the east, unknown seas and toun-
tries were found out, and a communication, long
de-fred, but hitherto concealed, was opened be-
tween E.urope and the opulent regions of India.
In compariion with events lb wonderful and unex-
peted, all that had hitherto been deemed great or
fplendidl, faded away and disappeared. Vast oh.

rouzed and interested by the profpe&, engaged
with ardour in pursuit of them, and exerted its
aa.ive powers in a new direction.

THIS spirit of enterprise, though but newly B O ° KC

awakened in Spain, began soon to operate ex- ---
tenfively. All the attempts towards discovery Difcoe9ics
made in that kingdom, had hitherto been carried idp.n ,° in
on by Columbus alone, and at the expence of the P: ^':C a-
fbvereign. But now private adventurers, allured
by the magnificent descriptions he gave of the re-
gions which he had vifrted, as well as by the fpe-
cimens of their wealth which he produced, offered
to fit out squadrons at their own risk, and to go
in quest of new countries. The Spanish court,
whole scanty revenues were exhausted by the
charge of its expeditions to the New World,
which, though they opened valt prospeds of future
benefit, yielded a very sparing return of present
profit, was extremely willing to devolve the bur-
den of discovery upon its fubjcts. It seized with
joy an opportunity of rendering the avarice, the
ingenuity, and efforts of projetors, infirumental
in promoting designs of certain advantage to the
public, though of doubtful success with refpec to
themselves. One of the first propositions of this Ojeda the
kind was made by Alonfo de Ojeda, a gallant and rfth
active officer, who had accompanied Columbus in
his second voyage. His rank and character pro-
cured( him such credit with tle merchants of Se-
ville, that they undertook to equip four s(ips,
provided he could obtain the royal licence, autlo-
riling the voyage. The powerful patronage of the
billiop of Bad:jos easily secured success in a suit so
agreeable to the court. Without consulting Co-

to direA his course, the bishop communicated to
him the admiral's journal of his last voyage, and
his charts of the countries which he had discovered.
Mary Ojeda struck out into no new path of navigation,

but adhering servilely to the route which Colum-
bus had taken, arrived on the coafl of Paria. He
traded with the natives, and flanding to the welt,
proceeded as far as Cape ce Vela, and ranged
along a considerable extent of coast beyond that
on which Columbus had touched. Having thus
ascertained the opinion of' Columnbus, that this
Oaeber. country was a part of the continent, Ojeda re-

turned by way of Hispaniola to Spain, with ofme
reputation as a discoverer, but with little benefit to

that a disaffection so general must have been occa-
sioned by real grievances, which called for redress.
The bishop of Badajos, with his usual animosity
against Columbus, encouraged these suspicions, and
confirmed them.

As soon as the queen began to give way to the Fatal efrfa.
torrent of calumny, a rflolution fatal to Columbus th
was taken. Francis de Bovadilla, a knight of Ca-
latrava, was appointed to repair to Hispaniola,
with full powers to inquire into the conduc& of
Columbus, and, if he should find the charge
of mal-administration proved, to supersede him,
and alfume the government of the island. It was
impollible to escape condemnation, when this pre-
pofterous commission made it the interest of the
judge to pronounce the person whom he was sent
to try, guilty. Though Columbus had now com-
posed all the dissensions in the ifand; though he

reverle of fortune, the firmness of mind whicil (di

plied for them, and by relxing the reins of dirci-

were mostly adventurers, whom their indigence or
crimes had impelled to abandon their native coun-
try, expressed the nmolt indecent fatisfatiion with
the disgrace and imprisonment of Columbus. They
flattered themlelves, that now they should enjoy an

employed in making reparation for his past susser-

exquifte. Columbus had experienced both from
the Spaniards; and their ungenerous conduct ex-
afperated him to such a degree, that he could no
longer conceal the sentiments which it excited.
Wherever he went, he carried about with him, as
a memorial of their ingratitude, those fetters with
which he had been loaded. They were constantly

He took the exact number of such as survived their

method of acquiring wealth but that of searching
for gold, this lervitude became as grievous as it
was unjult. The Indians were driven itu crowds

consisted of thirty-two ships, on board of which
two thousand five hundred perlons embarked, with
an intention of flttling in the country. Upon the ,so.
arrival of the new governor with this powerful -e-
inforce/nent to the colony, Bovadi!la rcligncd his
charge, and was commanded to return inltantly to
Spain, in order ro anlwer tor his condut. Rool-
dan, and the other ringleaders of the mulineers,
who had been molt active in opposing Columbus,
were required to leave the island at the fame time.
A proclamation was ilLuee, declaring the natives
to be siee fubjeds. of Spain, of whom no l'!vice
was to be exaEted contrary to their own inclinations
and without paying them an adequate price for
their labour. With relpctt to the Spaniards them-
selves, various regulations were made, tending to
fupprcfs the licentious spirit which had been so fa-
tal to the colony, and to cltablifl that reverence for
law and order on which society is founded, and to
which it is indebted for its increase and lability.
In order to limit the exorbitant gain which private
peribns were fliupplofcd to make by working the
nilnes, an ordinance was pullisihed, ldi-reting all
tie gold to be brought to a public Iinclting-houfe,
and declaring one half of it to be the property of

BUT even this ungenerous return did not dif- B 0 0 K

first called forth his inventive genius, and excited He' ors
him to attempt discovery. To open a new pas- nmeswof
sage to the East Indies was his original and favour- di"covery.
ite scheme. This still engrofed his thoughts; and,
either from his own observations in his voyage to
Paria, or from some obscure hint of the natives, or
from the accounts given by Baftidas and de la Co-
fa of their expedition, he conceived an opinion
that, beyond the continent of America, there was
a sea which extended to the East Indies, and hoped
to find iome strait or narrow neck of land, by which
a communication might be opened with it and the
part of the ocean already known. By a very for-
tunate conjecture, he supposed this firait or ilthmus
to be situated near the gulf of Darien. Full of
this idea, though he was now of an advanced age,
worn out with fatigue, and broken with infirmities,
he offered, with the alacrity of a youthful adven-
turer, to undertake a voyage which would afcer-
tain this important point, and perfect the grand
scheme which from the beginning he proposed to
accomplifi. Several circumstances concurred in
lilpofing Ferdinand and Isabella to lend a favour-
able ear to this proposal. They were glad to have
the pretext of any honourable employment for re-
moving from court a man with whose demands they
ldemeid it impolitic to comply, and whose services
it was indecent to neglect. Though unwilling to
reward Columbus, they were not insensible of his

seventy tons in burdcn, for performiing it. Ac-
customed to brave danger, an:d to engage in ardu- 502'
ous undertakings with inacdeqi.i:te force, he did not
hesitate to accept the command of this pitiful 1qua-
dron. His brother Bartholomew, and his second
son Ferdinand, the hitiorian of his adi ,ns, ac-
companied him. He failed from Cadiz on the
ninth of May, and touched, as ulual, at the Ca-
nary islands; from thence he purpolcd to have
fluoil direstly for the continent; but his la',geft
veffl was Io clumsy and unfit for service, as con-
lirained him to bear away for Hispaniola, in hopes
of exchanging her for some ship of the fleet that
h1ad carried out Ovando. When he arrived offSt. June 29.
Domingo, he found eighteen of there flips ready
loaded, and on the point of departing for Spain.
Columbus immediately acquainted the governor
with the destination of his voyage, and the accident
which had obliged him to alter his route. He re-
queried permiflion to enter the harbour, not only
that he might negociate the exchange of his snip,
but that he might take shelter during a violent
huiricane, of which he difccrned the approach
iro:n various prognoffics, which his expei icncc and
l;iacity had taught him to oblcrve. On tlhai ac-
count, lie adlvilcd him likcwilc to put off for lomc

the greatest attention, was regarded as the drean

to predia an event beyond the reach of human
foresight. The fleet set fail for Spain. Next
night the hurricane came on with dreadful impe.
tuofity. Columbus, aware of the danger, took
precautions against it, and saved his little squadron,
The fleet destined for Spain met with the fate which
the rashness and obfinacy of its commanders sd.

been the most active in persecuting Columbus, ani

all the wealth which they had acquired by their i.

in value two hundred thousand pesos; an immen:

Upon the ignorant and superstitious race of men, 150S
who were witnesses of this occurrence, it made a
different imprelfion. From an opinion, which
vulgar admiration is apt to entertain with refpe&
to persons who have distinguished themselves by
their sagacity and inventions, they believed Co-
lumbus to be possessed offupernatural powers, and
imagined that he had conjured up this dreadful
storm by magical art and incantations, in order

he had an interview with tome inhabitants of the
continent, who arrived in a large canoe. They
appeared to be a people more civilized, and who
had made greater progress in the knowledge of
useful arts, than any whom he had hitherto disco-
vered. In return to the inquiries which the Spa-
niards made, with their uliual cagernes, concern-

, ing in quest of a country so inviting, which would
5Ot. have conducted him along the coast of Yucatan

to the rich empire of Mexico, Columbus was so
bent upon his favourite scheme of finding out that
firait which communicated with the Indian ocean,
that he bore away to the east towards the gulf of
Darien. In this navigation he discovered all the
coast of the continent, fiom Cape Gracias a Dios,
to a harbour which, on account of its beauty and
security, he called Porto Bello. He searched, in
vain, for the imaginary strait, through which he
expected to make his way into an unknown fra;
and though he went on fllore several times, and
advanced into the country, he did not penetrate
to far as to cross the narrow iflhmus which fepa.
rates the gulf of Mexico from the great southern
ocean. He was so much delighted, however, with
the fertility of the country, and conceived such an
idea of its wealth, from the specimens of gold pro.
duced by the natives, that he resolved to leave a
finall colony upon the river Belem, in the province
j5o3. of Veragua, under the command of his brother,

and to return himself to Spain, in order to procure
what was requifire for rendering the eftablilinmcnt
permanent. But the ungovernable spirit of the
people under his command, deprived Columbus of
the glory of planting the firfl colony on the conti-
nent of America. Their insolence and riapaci(,ul-
ness provoked the natives to take arms, an I as

followed by a ftcceffion of all the difalfers to which

violent florms of thunder and lightning, threat-
ened his leaky vellels with deftrudion; while his
discontented crew, exhausted with fatigue, and
destitute of provisions, was unwilling or unable to
execute his commands. One of his ships perished;
he was obliged to abandon another, as unfit for
fcrvice; and with the two which remained, he
quitted that part of the continent which in his
anguish he named the Coafi of Vexation r, and
bore away for Hilpaniola. New diltrefies awaited
him in this voyage. He was driven back by a
violent tempelt fronm the coast of Cuba, his lhips
fell foul of one another, and were so much that-

yond the possibility of being repaired. To convey
J503' an account of his situation to Hispaniola, appeared

impraticable; and without this it was vain to ex.
pe& relief. His genius, fertile in resources, and
modi vigorous in those perilous extremities when
feeble minds abandon themselves to derpair, dif
covered the only expedient which afforded any
profped of deliverance. He had recourse to the
hospitable kindness of the natives, who confider.
ing the Spaniards as beings of a superior nature,
were eager, on every occasion, to minister to thei'
wants. From them he obtained two of their
canoes, each formed out of the trunk of a single
tree, hollowed with fire, and so mis-shapen and
aukward as hardly to merit the name of boats. In
these, which were fit only for creeping along the
coast, or crossing from one fide of a bay to an-
other, Mendez, a Spaniard, and Fiefchi, a Genoef:,
two gentlemen particularly attached to Columbus,
gallantly offered to set out for Hispaniola, upon a
voyage of above thirty leagues '. This they accom-
plihed in ten days, after furnounting incrcdibie
dangers, and enduring such fatigue, that fcveralct
the Indians who accompanied them funk under it,
and died. The attention paid to them by th:
governor of Hispaniola was neither such as tlicr
courage merited, nor the diflrefs of the perlbns
fiom whom they came, required. Ovanlo, from
a mean jealouly of Columbus, was afraid of allow

ing him to set his foot in the island under his n 0o K
government. This ungenerous paflion hardened -
his heart against every tender fcntiment, which '°o3'
rcflefifon upon the services and misfortunes of that
great man, or compaflion for his own fellow-
citizens involved in the fame calamities, mutl have
excited. Mendez and Fiefchi spent eight months
in soliciting relief for their commander and affo-
Liates, without any profped of obtaining it.

DURING this period, various paflons agilated rindlifrc&.

the mind of Columbus and his companions in ad- ings thc
verfity. Ar first the expectation of' speedy deli-
verance, from the success of Mendez and F;ielchi's
voyage, cheered the spirits of the most despond-
ing. After tome time the more timorous began to
fulpeft that they had niifcarried in their daring
attempt. At length, all concluded that they had 154,
perished. The ray of hope which had broke in
upon them, made their condition appear now more
dilmal. Despair, heightened by dilippointmenr,
fettled in every bredil. Their last relburce had
failed, and nothing remained but to end their
mifcrable days among nakeld fivages, falr 1rom

B o0 K the fame time, the natives murmured at the long

-_--' residence of the Spaniards in their country. As

their indultry was not greater than that of their
neighbours in Hispaniola, like them, they found
the burden of supporting so many Ilrangers to be
altogether intolerable. They began to bring in
provisions with reluctance, they furnished them
with a sparing hand, and threatened to withdraw
those supplies altogether. Such a resolution must
quickly have been fatal to the Spaniards. Their
safety depended upon the good will of the Indians;
and unless they could revive the admiration and
reverence with which that simple people had at
first beheld them, delruction was unavoidable.
Though the licentious proceedings of the muti-
neers had, in a great measure, effaced those im-
preflions which had been so favourable to the
Spaniards, the ingenuity of Columbus suggested a
happy artifice, that not only reflored but height-
ened the high opinion which the Indians had ori-
ginally entertained of them. By his skill in altro-
nomy, he knew that there was shortly to be a total
ecliple of the moon. He assembled all the principal
perlons of the diflricd around him on the day be-
fore it happened, and, after reproaching them for
their ficklcnefs in withdrawing their affecrion and
afliftance from men whom they had lately revered,
he told them, that the Spaniards were servants of
the Great Spirit who dwells in heaven, who made
and governs the world ; that he, offended at their

the moon should withhold her light, and appear
of a bloody hue, as a sign of the divine wrath,
and an emblem of the vengeance ready to fall
upon them. To this marvellous prediction some
of them listened with the careless indifference pecu-
liar to the people of America; others, with the
credulous astonishment natural to barbarians. But
when the moon began gradually to be darkened,
and at length appeared of a red colour, all were
struck with terror. They ran with consternation
to their houses, and returning instantly to Colum-
bus loaded with provisions, threw them at his feet,
conjuring him to intercede with the Great Spirit
to avert the deflru6tion with which they were
threatened. Columbus, seeming to be moved by
their entreaties, promiled to comply with their
(rfire. The eclipse went off, the moon recovered
its 1plendour, and from that day the Spaniards
were nor only furnished profusely with provisions,
but the natives, with fuperflitious attention, avoid-
ed every thing that could give them offence .

Enraged at this disappointment, they marched to-

remained, threatening him with new insults and
danger. While they were advancing, an event
happened, more cruel and affliEting than any cala-
mity which he dreaded from them. The governor
of Hitpaniola, whose mind was fill filled with
some dark fulpicions of Columbus, Ient a fmail
bark to Jamaica, not to deliver his diftrelnc(l
countrymen, but to spy out their condition. Lelt
the sympathy of those whom he employed should
affordl them relief, contrary to his intention, lie
gave the command of this vessel to Efcobar, an
inveterate enemy of Columbus, who adhering to
his inftrudions with malignant accuracy, call
anchor at some diltance from the island, ap-
proached the shore in a lfall boat, observed the
wretched plight of the Spaniards, delivered a letter
of empty compliment to the admiral, received his
answer, and departed. When the Spaniards fir(t
descried the veffil Itanding towards the illand,
every heart exulted, as if the long expe:ted hour
of their deliverance had at length arrived; but
when it dii;ppclarecl to suddenly, they flnk into
the deepest dcjecion, and all their hopes died
away. Columbus alone, though he felt milln
sensibly this wanton infuilt which Ovando aiddcl

ration. Many of the new settlers who came over
with Ovando, were Ieized with the distempers pe-
culiar to the climate, and in a short space above a
thousand of them died. At the fame time, the
exacting one half or the product of the mines as the
royal share, was found to be a demand so exorbi.
tant, that no adventurers would engage to work
them upon such terms. In order to save the co-
lony from ruin, Ovando ventured to relax the ri-
r5°Js gour of the royal ediSts. He made a new diftri-

bution of the Indians among the Spaniards, and
compelled them to labour, for a stared time, in
digging the mines, or in cultivating the ground;
but, in order to screen himself from the imputation
of having fubjeded them again to servitude, he
enjoined their masters to pay them a certain rnm,
as the price of their work. He reduced the royal
share of the gold found in the mines from the half
to the third part, and Loon after lowered it to a fifth,
at which it long remained. Notwithflanding la-
bella's tender concern for the good treatment of the
Indians, and Ferdinand's eagerness to improve the
royail 1rvciieue, Ovando perluadled the court to al.
prove of both thcli rcgulations '.

felt the yoke of bondage to be so galling, that B 13o K
they made several attempts to vindicate their own --Y-
liberty. This the Spaniards confidered as rebellion, '505'
and took arms in order to reduce them to subjec-
lion. When war is carried on between nations
whose ifate of improvement is in any degree fimi-
lar, the means of defence bear rome proportion to
those employed in the attack; and in this equal
contest such efforts must be made, such talents are
displayed, and such paflions roused, as exhibit
mankind to view in a situation no less striking than
interesting. It is one of the noblest functions of
history, to observe and to delineate men at a junc-
ture when their minds are most violently agitated,
and all their powers and passions are called forth.
Hence the operations of war, and the struggles be-
tween contending states, have been deemed by
hiltorians, ancient as well as modern, a capital
and important article in the annals of human ac-
tions. But in a contelt between naked lavages,
and one of the molt warlike of the European na-
tions, where science, courage, and dilcipline on
one fide, were opposcd by ignorance, rilnidlity, and
dilorder on the other, a particular dcair.' of cv.cl:s
would be as unpleasant as uninlhutiive. If the
simplicity and innocence of the In:li;;is lhdl in-
li)ired the Spaniards with humitaniry, had !fi't 'n(d

THE conduEt of Ovando, in another part of the B 0, K

island, was itill more treacherous and cruel. The t-,--o
province anciently named Xaragua, which extends Thrse
from the fertile plain where Leogane is now fituat- eaodsreanh-
ed, to the weltern extremity of the illand, was stub dI, o
jeci to a female cazique, named Anacoana, highly
repeded by the natives. She, from that partial
fondness with which the women of America were
attached to the Europeans (the cause of which
fiall be afterwards explained), had ;always courted
the fiiendflip of the Spaniards, and loaded them
with good offices. BLUt some of the adherents of
Roldan having fettled in her country, were lb much
exasperated at her endeavouring to restrain their
excefles, that they accused her of having formed a
p!an to throw off the yoke, and to exterminate the
Spaniards. Ovando, though he knew well how
lictle credit was due to such profligate men, march-
ed, without further inquiry, towards Xaragua, with
three hundred foot and fevcnry horl-men. To
prevent the Indians from taking alarm at this ho-
ilie appearance, he gave out that his lUle intention
was to visit Anacoana, to whom his countrymen
hail been so much indebted, in the most rc'i)betfiul
manner, and to regul.te \ith her tlhe :1ode o t levy-
ing the tribute payable to the king of Spain. Ana-
coana, in order to receive this illullriots gucll witli
due honour, altimbled the principal men in her
dlonlilnions, to the nulmber of: three hundred, and
adlvancing at the head of rhefl, aiccompanll di by a
valt crowd of pertbns of intfrior r.ank, ihe welcom-

B °o K ed Ovando with songs and dances, according to
a_-_v- the mode of the country, and conducted him to
'IS' the place of her residence. There he was feasted,

for some days, with all the kindness of simple ho-
fpirality, and amused with the games and fpeEtacles
usual among the Americans upon occasions or
mirth and festivity. But amidst the security which
this inspired, Ovando was meditating the deftruc.
tion of his unfufpicious entertainer and her sub-
jeas ; and the mean perfidy with which he execut-
ed this Icheme, equalled his barbarity in forming
it. Under colour of exhibiting to the Indians the
parade of an European tournament, he advanced
with his troops, in battle array, towards the hou:c
in which Anacoana and the chiefs who attended
her were assembled. The infantry took pofflion
of all the avenues which led to the village. The
horsemen encompassed the house. These move-
ments were the object of admiration without any
mixture of fear, until, upon a signal which h;,i
been concerted, the Spaniards suddenly drew their
swords, and rushed upon the Indians, defencelel,
and altonifhed at an act of treachery which exceed.
ed the conception of undesigning men. In a mo.
ment Anacoana was secured. All her attendants
were seized and bound. Fire was set to the houle;
and, without examination or convition, all there
unhappy persons, the most illullrious in their own
country, were confiimed in the flames, Anacoana
was reierved for a more ignominious fate. She
was carried in chains to Saint Domingo, and, aftcr

the formality of a trial before Spanilh judges, she C °0 o r
was condemned, upon the evidence of those very ---
men who had betrayed her, to be publicly hang- s i

the provinces of Hiipaniola submitted, without
farther refftance, to the Spanish yoke. Upon the
death of Isabella, all the regulations tending to
mitigate the rigour of their servitude were forgotten.
The fnlall gratuity paid to them as the price of their
lubour was withdrawn ; and at the fame time the
taflis imposed upon them were increaled. Ovando, '5'
without any rellraint, diltributed Indians among
his friends in the island. Ferdinand, to whom the
queen had left by will one half of the revenue ari-
ling from the fettlemcnts in the Nevw \orld, con-
ferred grants of a similar nature upon his courtiers,
as the least cxpenfive mode of rewarding their Icr-
vices. They farmed out rde Indians, of \:hou
they were rendered proprietors, to their country-
nen fettled in flilpaniola ; and that wretched
people, being compelled to labour in order to la-
tisfy the rapacity of both, the exactions of their
oppressors no longer knew any bounds. Bur, bar-

_-"--- very considerable effects. By calling forth the
'506. force of a whole nation, and exerting it in one di-

redion, the working of the mines was carried on
with amazing rapidity and luccefs. During icve.
ral years, the gold brought into the royal fineti::.
houses in Hispaniola amounted annually to fuur
hundred and sixty thousand pesos, above a hundred
thousand pounds tierling; which, if we attend to
the great change in the value of money since the

by way of experiment, they were found to thrive
with Itich increase in the rich suil and warm climate
to which they were transplanted, that the cultiva-
tion of them soon became an objed of commerce.
Extensive plantations were begun; fugar-works,
which the Spaniards called ingenio's from the va-
rious machinery employed in them, were erected,
and in a few years the manufacture of this com-
modity was the great occupation of the inhabitants
of Hispaniola, and the mont considerable source of
their wealth .

THE prudent endeavours of Ovando, to promote P,,itical re-

glations of

the welfare of the colony, were powerfully second- I:,erdinand
ed by Ferdinand. The large remittances which
he received from the New World, opened his eyes,
at length, with relpe&t to the importance of those:
discoveries, which he had hitherto afifeed to un-
dervalue. Fortune, and his own address, having
now extricated him out of those difficulties in which
he had been involved by the death of his queen, 1,o7.
and by his difputcs with his fon-in-law about the

L-d--i- wretched days. Others, prompted by impatience

j°'. and despair, cut short their lives with a violent

hand. Famine, brought on by compelling such
numbers to abandon the culture of their lands, in
order to labour in the mines, proved fatal to many.
Dileafes of various kinds, lome occasioned by the
h1ardlhips to which they were exposed, and others
by their intercourse with the Europeans, complet-
ed the desolation of the iflsnd. The Spaniards be-
ing thus deprived of the instruments which they
were accuRlomed to employ, found it impossible to
extend their improvements, or even to carry on the
15cS. works which they had already begun. In order to

provide an immediate remedy for an evil so alarm-
ing, Ovando propoecd to transport the inhabitants
of the Lucavo islands to Hispaniola, under pre-
tence that they might be civilized with more Laci-
lity, and intlruted to greater advantage in the
Chrillian religion, if they were united to the Spa-
nifh colony, and under the immediate inlpeEtion of
the millionaries fettled there. Ferdinand, deceiv-
ed by this artifice, or willing to connive at an aqt
of violence which policy repreiented as neceflllr,
gave his aflcii to the protol)l. Several vt-flcls
were fitted out for the Lucayos, the command(r3
of which iiltormeid the natives, with whole lain-
,ll.age they were now well acquainted, that they

thither, to partake of the bliss enjoyed there by n o o K
happy spirits. That simple people liflened with
wonder and credulity; and, fond of visiting their
relations and friends in that happy region, follow-
ed the Spaniards with eagerness. By this artifice,
above forty thousand were decoyed into Hispaniola,
to flare in the sufferings which were the lot of the
inhabitants of that island, and to mingle their
groans and tears with thole of that wretched race
of men .

THE Spaniards had, for some time, carried on N..V !cn-

their operations in the mines of Hilpaniola with "l:.nr .
such ardor as well as success, that theft seemed to
have engrossed their whole attention. The spirit
ofdifcovery languished ; and, since the last voyage
of Columbus, no enterprize of any moment had
been undertaken. But as the decrease of the In-
dians rendered it impossible to acquire wealth in
that island with the fame rapidity as formerly, this
urged them to search for new countries, where
their avarice might be gratified with more facility.
Juan Ponce de Leon, who commanded under 0-
vando in the eastern dinridl of Hilpaniola, paffTl
over to the island of $t. Juan de Puerto Rico,
which Columbus had discovered in his second voy-
age, and penetrated into the interior part of the
country. As he found the bfil to be fertile, and

. --- . the' information of the inhabitants, to discover

mines of gold in the mountains, Ovando permitted
him to attempt making a settlement in the island.
This was easily efftCted by an officer eminent for
conduct no lels than for courage. In a few years
Puerto Rico was fubjeeted to the Spanifl govern.
ment, the natives were reduced to servitude; and,
being treated with the fame inconsiderate rigour ,s
their neighbours in Hispaniola, the race of original
inhabitants, worn out with fatigue and fc.crinri,
was soon exterminated k

ABOUT the fame time, Juan Diaz de Solis, in

conjuncion with Vincent Yanez Pinzon, one of
Columbus's original companions, made a voyage
to the continent. They held the fame courlf
which Columbus had taken, as far as the island of
Guanaios; but, flanding from thence to the welC,
they discovered a new and extensive province, as-
terwards known by the namen of Yucatan, and pro-
cetcled a conliderable way along the co.ll of thal
country '. Though nothing meimorable occurred
in this voyage, is delbcives notice, bcc:ufc it led to

Ever since the death of Columbus, his son Don l,li:,ioi,
Diego had been employed in soliciting Ferdinand
to grant him the offices of viceroy and admiral in
tlie New World, together witl all the other im-
munities and profits which descended to him by in-
heritance, in conflquence of the original capitula-
tion of his father. But if thlele dignities and re-
venues appeared so considerable to Ferdinand, that,
at the expence of being dcemcnd unjult, as well as
un:gratei-ul, he had wrested them from Colnumbus,
it is not surprising that he fhiukl b- unwilling to

intereftecl very powerful perlons in the success of
his claims. The fcntence of the council of the In-
dies gave him a title to a rank Ib elevated, and a
fortune so opulent; that he found no difficulty in
concluding a marriage with Donna Maria, daugh.
ter of Don Ferdinand de Toledo, great commcn-
dator of Leon, and brother of the duke of Alva,
a nobleman of the first rank, and nearly related to
the king. The duke and his family espoused so
warmly the cause of their new ally, that Ferdi-
nand could not resist their lolicitations. He re.
called Ovando, and appointed Don Diego his fuc-
cefror, though, even in conferring this favour, he
could not conceal his jealousy; for he allowed him
to assume only the title of governor, not that of
viceroy, which had been adjudged to belong to
him ".

hinmfelf had been cruelly defrauded. The colony -
itself acquired new lustre by the acceffon of to 509'
many inhabitants, of a dilferent rank and cha-
rater from most of thole who had hitherto migra-
ted to America, and many of the molt i.llultrious
families in the Spanifi settlements are descended
from the persons who at that time accompanied
Don Diego Columbus °.

No benefit accrued to the unhappy natives from
this change of governors. Don Diego was not
only authorised by a royal edict to continue the
repartiientos, or dillribnition of Indians; but the
particular number which he might grant to every
person, according to his rank in the colony, was
specified. He availed himself of that permilTon;
and soon after he landed at St. Domingo, he
divided such Indians as were still unappropriated,
among his relations and attendants '.

acquired by the fishery of pearls, which was car.
ried on with extraordinary ardour. The Indians,
especially those from the Lucayo ifands, were

the history of mankind any thing more singular or
extravagant than the form which they deviled for
this purpose. They infiructed those invaders, as
soon as they landed on the continent,, to declare to
the natives the principal articles of the Chriltian
faith; to acquaint them, in particular, with the
supreme jurifdition of the Pope over all the king-
doms of the earth; to inform them of the grant
which this holy pontiff had made of their country
to the king of Spain ; to require them to embrace
the doftrines of that religion which the Spaniards
made known to them; and to submit to the fove.
reign whose authority they proclaimed. If the na.
tives refused to comply with this requisition, the
terms of which must have been utterly incompre-
henfible to uninftruEted Indians, then Ojeda and
Nicueffa were authorised to attack them with
sword and fire; to reduce them, their wives and
children, to a state of servitude; and to compel
them by force to recognize the jurifdistion of the
church, and the authority of the monarch, to
which they would not voluntarily subject thcm-

foreign priest, of whom they had never heard,
could have any right to dispose of their country, or
how an unknown prince should claim jurifdidion
over them as his fubjeats, they fiercely opposed
the new invaders of their territories. Cjeda and
Nicueffa endeavoured to effócct by force what they
could not accomplifl by persuasion. The con-
temporary writers enter into a very minute detail
in relating their tranfaftions; but as they made no
discovery of importance, nor eftablilhed any per-
manent settlement, their adventures are not intitled
to any considerable place in the general hiltory of
a period, where romantic valour, firuggling with
incredible hardships, diftinguilh every effort of the
Spanish arms. They found the natives in those
countries of which they went to assume the govern-
ment, to be of a character very different from that
of their countrymen in the illands. They were
fierce and warlike. Their arrows were dipped in a
poison so noxious, that every wound was llowed
with certain death. In one encounter they flew
above fcventy of OCjcda's followers, and the Spa-
niards, for the irft time, were taught to dread the
inhabitants of the New World. Nicutle- was op.)

B o0 K refused to hold any intercourse, or to exchange any

-^_.-iJ friendly office, withi men whole residence among

tives, though it rendered it extremely difficult as
well as dan ;erous to establish a settlement in their
country miht have been surmounted at length by
the perseverance of the Spaniards, by the fuperi.
ority of their arms, and their fliill in the art (f
war. But every difafler which can be accumulatul
upon the unfortunate, combined to complete thc:r
ruin. The lols of their ships by various accidents
upon an unknown coafi, the dilfalcs peculiar to a
climate the nmolt noxious in all America, the waiit
of provisions, unavoidable in a country imperfecciy
cultivated, dissention among themselves, and ti.:
incefTant hoflilities of the natives, involved thcr
in a fuccefion of calamities, the bare recital of
which strikes one with horror. Though they re-
ceived two considerable reinforcements fromn li.
paniola, the greater part of tlofe who had eng{. '!
in this unhappy expedition, perished, in lcfs than
a year, in tlhe mos. extreme misery. A few wl

in this expedition who will appear with lustre in B O O K-
more important kcenes. Francisco Pizarro was _--- -
one of Ojedo's companions, and in this school of ''
adversity acquired or improved the talents which
fitted him for the extraordinary a.dions which he
afterwards performed. Hernan Cortes, whose
name became still more famous, had likcwvife en-
gaged early in this enterprile, which roused all the
active youth of Hispaniola to arms; but the good
fortune that accompanied him in his lfubequent
adventures, interposed to save him from the
dilafters to which his companions were exposed.
Hle was taken ill at St. Domingo before the
departure of the fleet, and detained there by a

B OOK when the countries which produced these rich

'U. .-,-' commodities, defended only by naked savages,

5' might be seized by the first bold invader; obieds

so singular and alluring, rouzed a wonderful ipirit
of enterprise among the Spaniards, who rufeted
with ardour into this new path that was opened to
wealth and diflintion. While this spirit continued
warm and vigorous, every attempt either tov.,ar.;
discovery or conquest was applauded, and advcn.
turers engaged in it with emulation. The pai;r,
for new undertakings, which charaFterifes the a-e
of discovery in the latter part of the fifteenth anll
beginning of the sixteenth century, would alue
have been sufficient to prevent the Spaniards 'ron
flopping short in their career. But circumftanccs
peculiar to Hispaniola at this juncture, concurred
with it in extending their navigation and con.
quests. The rigorous treatment of the inhabitants
of that ifand having almost extirpated the rare,
many of the Spanish planters, as I have alreacv
obefrved, finding it impofifble to carry en their
works with the fame vigour and profit, were ob.
liged to look out for settlements in tome country
whose people were not yet wafted by opprefiun,
Others, with the inconfideratc levity natural t
men upon whom wealth pours in with a fuddcacn
flow, had squandered, in thoinghtlefs prodi;glil:
what they acquired with ealc, and were driven by
neceflity to embarl in the moll: delperate lihels,
in order to retrieve their affairs. From all tilic
causes, when Don Diego Coluimbus propol(ldl to

midated by the appearance of their new enemies,
but unprepared to refit them. For though, from
the time that the Spaniards took pofefflon of the
adjacent island, there was reason to expecE a de-
scent on their territories, none of the small conm
munities into which Cuba was divided, had either
made any provision for its own defence, or had
formed any concert for their common safety. The
only obilrudion the Spaniards met with was from

condemned him to the flames. When Hatuey
was fastened to the flake, a Franciscan friar labour.
ing to convert him, promied him immediate ad.
micrance into the joys of heaven, if he would em.
brace the Chriflian faith. " Are there any Spa-
niards," fays he, after tome pause, " in that
region of bliss which you delcribe ?" Yes,"
replied the monk, " but only such as are worthy
and good." " The befl of them," returned the
indignant cazique, "have neither worth nor good-
ness; I will not go to a place where I may meet
with one of that accursed race ." This dreadful
example of vengeance struck the people of Cuba
with such terror, that they scarcely gave any oppo.
fition to the progress of their invaders; and Ve-
lafquez, without the loss of a man, annexed this
extensive and fertile island to the Spanish mo.
narchy Y.

D covery of THE facility with which this important conquefl
1lorid. was completed, served as an incitement to other

undertakings. Juan Ponce de Ieon, having ac-
quired both fame and wealth by the reduction of
Puerto Rico, was impatient to engage in tome

new enterprise. He fitted out three ships at his B 0 o K
own expence, for a voyage of dil'covery, and his --
reputation soon drew togtther a respeCtable body 152:.
of followers. He directed his course towards the
Lucayo islands; and after touching at Ifveral of
them, as well as of the Bahama isles, he stood to
the south-west, and discovered a country hitherto
unknown to the Spaniards, which he called Flo-
rida, either because he fell in with it on Palm
Sunday, or on account of its gay and beautiful
appearance. He attempted to land in different
places, but met with such vigorous opposition
from the natives, who were fierce and warlike, as
convinced him that an increase of force was requi-
site to effec a settlement. Satisfied with having
opened a communication with a new country, of
whose value and importance he conceived very
sanguine hopes, he returned to Puerto Rico,
through the channel now known by the name of
the Gulf of Florida.

IT was not merely the pafflon of searching for

new countries that prompted Ponce de Leon to
undertake this voyage, he was influenced by one
of thole visionary ideas, which at that time often
mingled with the spirit of discovery, and rendered
it more active. A tradition prevailed among the
natives of Puerto Rico, that in the isle of Bimini,
one of the Lucayos, there was a fountain of such
wonderful virtue as to renew the youth, and recal

R 2 the

B 0 0 K the vigour of every person who bathed in its fail.
--.-~-- tary waters. In hopes of finding this grand reftora-
£51. tive, Ponce de Leon and his followers ranged

through the islands, searching, with fruitless folici.
tude and labour, for the fountain, which was the
chief object of their expedition. That a tale so
fabulous should gain credit among simple unin.
firuted Indians is not surprising. That it flould
make any impression upon an enlightened people
appears, in the present age, altogether incredible.
The fa&, howevtr, is certain; and the molt
authentic Spanish historians mention this extrava-
gant rally of their credulous countrymen. The
Spaniards, at that period, were engaged in a caieer
of activity which gave a romantic turn to their
imagination, and daily presented to them trange
and marvellous objects. A new world was ope ed
to their view. They vifiitd islands and continents
of whose existence mankind in former ages had no
conce; tion. In those delightful countries nature
seemel to afiime another Jorm; every tree and
plant and animal was different from those of the
ancient hemisphere. They itemed to be tranf-
ported into enchanted ground; and, after the
wonders which they had seen, nothing, in the
warmth and novelty of their admiration, appeared
to them so extraordinary as to be beyond belicf.
If the rapid fucceflion of new and striking iccnts
made such imprellion even upon the foundt under-
standing of Columbus, that he boasted of having
found the feat of Paradise, it will not appear

SOON after the expedition to Florida, a disco- Proerets of

other part of America. Balboa having been railed
to the government of the small colony at Santa
Maria in Darien, by the voluntary fulfrage of his
associates, was lb extremely dcfirous to obtain from
the crown a confirmation of their eleEtion, that he
dilpatchcd one of his officers to Spain, in order to
solicit a royal commniffon, which might invelt him
with a legal title to the supreme command. Con-
fcious, however, that he could not expect success
fiom the patronage of Ferdinand's miniflers, with
whom he was unconnected, or from negociating in
a court to the arts of which he was a stranger, he
endeavoured to merit the dignity to which he alpir-
ed, and aiming at performing some signal service
that would secure him the preference to every com-
petitor. Full of this idea, he made frequent in-
roads into the adjacent country, subdued several
of the caziques, and collcatcd a considerable cluan-
tity of gold, which abounded more in that part of
the continent than in the islands. In one of tholi
excursions, the Spaniards contended with such ca-
gcrnefs about the division of Io:e gold, that they

'55"' present, ailonifhed at the high value which they

set upon a thing of which he did not discern the
ule, tumbled the gold out of the balance with in-
dignation; and, turning to the Spaniards, " Why
do you quarrel (fays he) about such a trifle? If
you are so paffionarely fond of gold, as to abandon
your own country, and to disturb the tranquillity
ofdiftant nations for its fake, I will conduct you to
a region where the metal which seems to be the
chief object of your admiration and desire, is to
common,that the meanefl utensils are formedof it."
Tranlporied with what they heard, Balboa and his
companions inquired eagerly where this happy
country lay, and how they might arrive at it ? 1-e
informed them that at the diltance of fix funs, that
is of fix days journey towards the south, they should
discover another ocean, near to which this wealthy
kingdom was liuated; but if they intended to at-
tack that powerful tRate, they rnuft assemble forces
far fjperior in number and flrength to thole with
which they now appeared",

and the enterprising ardour of his genius. He inm- B °0 K
mediately concluded the ocean which the cazique '---.
mentioned, to be th.:t for which Columbus had 15''.
searched without success in this part of America,
in hopes of opening a more direc communication
with the East Indies; and he conje&tured that the
rich territory w',ich had Lw.en defcri. ed to him,
must be part of that vast and opulent region r.l' lhe
earth. Elated with the idea of performing what
so great a man had attempted in vain; and eager
to accomplilh a discovery which he knew would be
no lels acceptable to the king than beneficial to
his country, he was impatient until he could set
out upon this enterprile, in comparison of which
all his former exploits appeared inconsiderable.
But previous arrangement and preparation were
requilire to ensure fuccers. He began with court-
ing and securing the friendship of the neigihbouring
caziques. lie lent ibme of his officers to !-lifpa-
niola with a large quantity of gold, as a proof of
his past success, and an carnefr of his future hopes.
By a proper difiributtion of this, they Iecutrecd the
favour of the governor, and allured volunteers into
the service. A confidcrable reinforcement from
that ifand joined him, and he thought himfcelf in
a condition to attempt tle discovery.

_-rv- it a barrier of solidity sufficient to refilt the impulil
151. of two opposite oceans. 'I he mountains are co-

vered with forests alnioit inacccflble. The valleys
in that moist climate, where it rains during two-
thirds of the year, are ma;rlly, and so frcqucntl/
overflowed, that the inhabicants find it ncccftary,
in many places, to build thel-r loul1s upon trees,
in order to be elevated at loine diltance from ith
damp foil, and the odious reptiles engendered in
the putrid waters b. Large rivers rush down with
an impetuous current from the high grounds. In
a region thinly inhabited by wandering Savages, the
hand of indu(lry had done nothing to mitigate or
correct those natural dilsidvantages. To march
across this unexplored country, vith no other
guides but Indians, whole fidelity culd be little
trulted, was, on all those accounts, the boldelt
enterprise on which the Spaniards had hicherto
ventured in the New World. But the intrepidity
of Balboa was such as dillinguifhed him among hlis
1513. countrymen, at a period when every adventurer

was conspicuous for daring courage. Nor was
bravery his only merit; he w.is prudent in condue,
generous, affable, and polilcl:d of those popular
talents which, in the molt delperate undertakings,
inspire confidence and lccure attachment. I:vrn

hardy veterans, inured to the climate of America, _
and ready to follow him through every danger. A 1513'
thoufancl ndians attended ihem to carry their pro-
vifons; and to complete their warlike array, they
took with them fevcral oi those fierce dogs, whi.hl
were no lets formidable than declrucdive to their
naked enemies.

BALBOA set out upon this inportant expedition ric-v.rr

tile Suuih

on the first of September, about the time that the sA.
periodical rains began to abate. Fle proceeded by
tea, and without any diui ty, to thr territories of
a cazique whose fiiindflip, he had gained ; but no
iboner did he begin to advance into tl:e interior
part of the country, than he was retarded by every
obstacle which he had realon t) appelht.nd, from
the nature of the territory, or the dipi:ofition of its
inhabitants. Some of the caziques, at iis approach,
fled to the mountains with all their peuple, and
carried off or defroyed whatever could all;rd luib-
fillence to his troops. 0:hers colleced their lib-
jccs, in order to oppole his iprogrels, and he cquick-
ly perceived what an ard(tous undcrta;lliing it was,
tocondudt ;such a body of men througli h Iiolile na-
tions, acrols iwamps and rivers, and woods( which
had never been p;asfd but by ftraiggling Indians.

danger, by promiiinl; coiifidentl) to his troops the
tnjoyment of honour and riches superior to what

had

B o0 K had been attained by the most successful of their

-,-_i countrymen, he inspired them with such enthufi.
51'3@ aflic relblution, that they followed him without

murmuring. When they had penetrated a good
way into the mountains, a powerful cazique ap-
peared in a narrow pals, with a numerous body of
his fu'ljeEts to obltrud their progress. But men
who had surmounted so many obstacles, deipiled
the opposition of such feeble enemies. They at-
tacked themn with impetuosity, and having difper-
fed them with much ease and great slaughter, con.
tinued their march. Though their guides had re-
presented the breadth of the isthmus to be only a
journey of fix days, they had already spent twenty-
five in forcing their way through the woods and
mountains. Many cf them were ready to fink un-
der such uninterrupted fatigue in that sultry cli-
mate, several were flized with the difeales peculiar
to the country, and all became impatient to reach
the period of their labours and fuffcrings. At
length the Indians allured them, that from the top
of the next mountain they Ihould dilcover the ocean
which was the object of their wishes. When, with
iniiiite toil, they had climbed up the greater part
of that dceep alcent, Balboa commanded his men
to halt, and advanced llone to the fumrmit, that
he might be the firfl who should enjoy a fpescacle
which hie had lo long defiied. As soon as he be-

prudence restrained him from attempting to invade
it with an handful of men, exhaustcd by fatigue,
and weakened by difeales'. He determined to
lead back his followers, at present, to their fcetle-
ment at Santa Maria in Darien, and to return 1iuxt
season with a force more adequate to such an ardit-
ous enterprize. In order to acquire a more extcn-

five knowledge of the isthmus, he marched back B 0 o K
by a different route, which he found to be no less -y-
dangerous and difficult than that which he had for- '513'
merly taken. But to men elated with success, and
animated with hope, nothing is insurmountable.
Balboa returned to Santa Maria, from which he 5'14.
had been abfcnt four months, with greater glory
and more trealure than the Spaniards had acquired
in any txxp)eirion in the New World. None of
B.lboa's ,finrctrs diflinguifhed himself more in this
service than Sant' ilco Pizarro, or affilted with
greater courage and ardour in opening a commu-
nication with those countries, in which he after-
wards acted such an illufirious part '.

BALBOA'S first care was to fend information to Pedrarias

Spain of the important discovery which he had gvernorof
made; and to demand a reinforcement of a thou- Dri
sand men, in order to attempt the conquest of that
opulent country, concerning which he had received
Ifch inviting intelligence. The first account of the
discovery of the New World hardly occasioned
greater joy, than the unexpected tidings, that a
paffige was at last found to the great southern
ocean. The communication with the East Indiec,
by a course to the westward of the line of demar-
cation, drawn by the Pope, ieemed now to be cer-
tain. The vast wealth which flowed into Portugal
from its settlements and conquefis in that country,

gernefs to obtain it, was willing to make an effort
beyond what Balboa required. But even in this
exertion, his jealous policy, as well as the fatal
antipathy of Fonseca, now bishop of Burgos, to
every man of merit who distinguished himielf in
the New World, were conspicuous. Notwith.
tfanding Balboa's recent services, which marked
himn out as the nmot proper person to finifi that
great undertaking which he had begun, Ferdinand
was so ungenerous as to overlook these, and to ap-
point PeJrarias Davila governor of Darien. He
gave him the command of fifteen stout vessels, and
twelve hundred soldiers. These were fitted out at
the public expence, with a liberality which Ferdi.
nand hid never displayed in any former armament
destined fJr the New World ; and such was the ar-
dour of the Spaniil gentlemen to follow a leader
who was about to conduct them to a country,

their nets into the lea and draw out gold :, that

Balboa of his arrival, with the king's commillion, ----C.
to be governor f the colony. To their aftoniih- I54'

they had heard so much, and of wlhofe opulence
they had formed filch high ideas, clad in a canvas
jacket, and wearing coarse hempen landals uled
only by the meanelt pealants, employed together
with foine Indians, in thatching his own hut with
reeds. Even in this finiple garb, which corre-
fponded Ib ill with the expectations and withes of
his new guelts, Balboa received them with dignity.
The fame of his discoverics had drawn so many
adventurers from the ilands, that he could now
muster four hundrel and fifty men. At thl head
of those daring veterans, he was more than a match
for the forces which Pedrarias brought with him.
But though his troops murmured loudly at the in-
justice of the king in fuperleding their commander,
and complained that itrangers would now reap the
fruits of their toil and success, Balboa submitted
with implicit obedience to the will of his Lbvereign,
and received Pedrarias with all the deference due
to his charater '.

v---' he had then been guilty. Balboa felt sensibly the
5 I' mortification of being fibjeded to trial and to pu-

nifhmenr in a place where he had so lately occupied
thne firt fration. Pedrarias could not conceal his
jealousy of his superior merit; so that the relent-
ment of the one, and the envy of the other, gave
rife to diffcnfins extremely detrimental to the co-
lony. Ic was threatened with a calamity fill more
July. fatal. Pedrarias had landed in Darien at a most

unlucky time of the year, about the middle of the
rainy clalbn, in that part ol th. torrid zone where
the clouds pour down such tonrints as are unknown
in more temperate climates k. The village of Sania
Maria was ;fated in a rich plain, environed with
marshes and woods. The conft:tution of Euro-
peans was unable to witbL and the peltilential infl'-
ence of such a firuation, in a clmnate naturally f0
noxious, and at a leafun so peculiarly unhealtiy.
A violent and deltructive malady carried off many
of the foldicrs who accompanied Pedrarias. An
extreme lcarcity of provisions augmented this til-

and were glad to relinquiflh all their hopes of B o o° K-
wealth, in order to escape from that pernicious re-
gion. Pedrarias endeavoured to divert those who '15'4
remained from brooding over their misfortunes, by
finding them employment. With this view, he
sent several detachments into the interior parts of
the country, to levy gold among the natives, and
to search for the mines in which it was produced.
Those rapacious adventurers, more attentive to
present gain than to the means of facilitating their
future progress, plundered without diflinction
wherever they marched. Regardless of the alli-
ances which Balboa had made with fevcral of the
caziques, they firipped them of every thing va-
luable, and treated them, as well as their tlubjeces,
with the utmost insolence and cruelty. By their
tyranny and exaScions, which Pedrarias, either
from want of authority or of inclination, did not
restrain, all the country from the gulf of Darien to
the lake of Nicaragua was defclated, and the Spa-
niards were inconsiderately deprived of tlie advan-
tages which they might have derved from the
fricniflnip of the natives, in extndin;g thli: con-

upon the South Sea, with very extensive privileges
and authority. At the lame time he enjoined Pe-

to consult with him concerning every measure

the interpositions and exhcortaitions of the bifhlop ol

and, in order to cement this union more firmly,
Pedrarias agreed to give his daughter in marriage

reforred to him, and, with the countenance and
aid of Pedrarias, he began to prepare for his ex-
pedition to the South Sea. In order to accomplifl
this, it was neccflary to build vcffels capable of
conveying his troop, to thole provinces which he
purpoted to invade. After lurmounting many Is'7.
obltacles, and enduring a variety of tholf hardfhlips
which were the portion of the conquerors of Ame-

with Balboa had never been cordial, the progress
which he made revived his ancient enmity, and
added to its rancour. He dreaded the prosperity
and elevation of a man whom he had injured so
deeply. tHe suspected that fiiccefs would encou-
rage himn to aim at indtpendencc upon his jurildic-
tiun; and fb violently did the pallions of hatred,
fear, and jealo.usy, operate upon his mind, that,
in order to gratify his vengeance, he fcrup!ed not

B 0 i K Balboa, with the unfufpicious confidence of a man
L--)J conscious of no crime, initantly obeyed the fum-

1517' mons ; but as soon as he entered the place, he was

arreiled by order of Pedrarias, vlio!f impatience to
:atiate his revenge did not ifu;lr him to languish
long in confinement. Judges were immediately
appointed to proceed to his trial. An accusation
of disloyalty to the king, and of an intention to re-
volt againlt the governor, was preferred against
him. Sentence of death was pronounced; and
though the judges who paflfe it, fcconded by the
whole colony, interceded warmly for his pardon,
Pedrarias continued inexorable; and the Spaniards
beheld, with astonishment and sorrow, the public
execution of a man whom they universally deem.
ed more capable than any who had borne com-
mand in America, of forming and accomplishing
great designs °. Upon his death, the expedition
which he had planned was relinquifled. Pedra-
rias, notwithitanding the violence and injuflice of
his proceedings, was not only screened fiom pu-
niflment by the po\werful patronage of the bishop
of Burgos and other courtiers, but continued in
powcr. Soon after, he obtained permiflion to re-
move the colony from its unwholesome fllation at
Santa Maria to Panama, on the op[pof ie *ile of
the il[thius ; and though it (iid not g-ain much in
point of healthfiiulnelf by the change, the commo-

DURING there tranlfations in Darien, the hiflory 1'5;

of which it was proper to carry on in an uninter- ,,i,.
rupted tenour, several important events occurred
with respect to the dilcovery, the conquelr, and
government of other provinces in the New World.
Ferdinand was so intent upon opening a commu-
nication with the Molucca or Spice flands by the
weft, that, in the year one thousand five hundred
and fifteen, I;e fitted out two ships at his own ex-
pence, in order to attempt such a voyage, and gave
the command of them to Juan Diaz de Solis, who
was deemed one of the most skilful navigators in
Spain. He flood along the coast of South Ame-
rica, and, on the filrt of January one thousand
five hundred and sixteen, entered a river, which he
called Janeiro, where an extensive commerce is
now carried on. Flrom thence he proceeded to a
spacious bay, which lie Iiippolcd to be the entrance
into a fIrait that communicated with the Indian
ocean; but upon advancing farther, he found it
to be the mouth of Rio dec Plata, one of the val:
rivers by which the lfuthein continent of America
is watered. In cndcavouring to make a d lccn n in
this country, )D Solis and 1ever-.l of his crew were
slain by the natives, who, in lighlt of the flip., cut

--,- Discouraged with the loss of their commander, and
1517' terrified at this Ihocking fpetdacle, the furvivig

Spaniards set fail for Europe, without aiming at
any farther discovery q. Though this attempt
proved abortive, it was not withoi, benefit. It
turned the attention of ingenious men to this course
of navigation, and prepared the way for a more
fortunate voyage, in which, a few years polterior
to this period, the great deiign that Ferdinand had
in view was accomnplflhed.

State of lhe THOUGH the Spaniards were thus actively em-
Hifpnioia, ployed in extending their dilfoveries and fettle-

nients in America, they fill coniidered Hilpaniola
as their principal colony, and the feat of govern-
ment. Don Diego Columnbu wanted neither in-
clination nor abilities to have rendered the mem-
bers of this colony, who were most immediately
under his jurifdicfion, prorperous and happy. But
he was circumscribed in all his operations by the
suspicious policy of Ferdinand, who on every oc-
cafion, and under pretexts the mot frivolous, re-
trenched his privileges, and encouraged the trea-
lurer, the judges, and other subordinate officers,
to counteract his mea;lires, and to ditliure his au-
thlority. The mol: valuable preroga.tive which the
governor p(trtlT(ed, was that of (1ditlribuling Ildianls

rigorous servitude of those unhappy men having B O1 K
been but little mitigated by all the regulations in '-.-
their favour, the power of parcellng out fiu:h ne- 1'57'
ceffary infiruments of labnol at plealure, tfcured
to the governor great ii-.luence in the colony. In
order to strip him of this, Ferdinand created a new
office, with the power of dif.ributing the Indians,
and beltowed i' upon Rodrigo Albuquerqule, a re-
lation of Zap.,ta, his confidential minifier. Mor-
tified with the injufice, as well as intl .!iry, of this
invasion upon his rights, in a point lo cifential,
Don Diego could no longer remain in a place where
his power anid confcqucnce were alinoil annihilated.
He rep ;ircd to Spain with the vain hopes of ob-
taining redrelsr. Albuquerque entered upon his
office with all the rapacity of an indigent adven-
turer, impatient to amais wealth. I-He began with
taking the exact number of Indians in the island,
and found, that from lixtv tlhouilaid, who, in the
year one thoufCand five hundred and eight, lLrv ivd

thought themselves aggrieved, but touched the
hearts of all who retained any sentiments of huma-
nity. From the time that Ecclefiaflics were sent
as inftrutors into America, they perceived that
the rigour with which their countrymen treated
the natives, rendered their ministry altogether
fruitless. The missionaries, in conformity to the
mild spirit of that religion which they were em-
ployed to publifl, early remonfirated againit the
maxims of the planters with respect to the Ameri-
cans, and condemned the rcpartimientos, or diJ/ri-
butions, by which they were given up as naves to
their conquerors, as no leis contrary to natural
justice and the precepts of Chriltianity, than to
found policy. The lominicans, to whom the in-

Columbus, the principal officers of the colony, B o o K
and all the laymen who had been his hearers, G-.--
complained of the monk to his superiors; but they, 517'
instead of condemning, applauded his doctrine, as
equally pious and seasonable. The Franciscans,
influenced by the spirit of opposition and rivalfhip
which subsists between the two orders, discovered
some inclination to take part with the laity, and
to espouse the defence of the repartimientos. But as
they could not with decency give their avowed
approbation to a system of oppression, so repug,
nant to the spirit of religion, they endeavoured to
palliate what they could not justify, and alleged,
in excuse for the conduct of their countrymen,
that it was impoflible to carry on any improve-
ment in the colony, unless the Spaniards possessed
such dominion over the natives, that they could
compel them to labour'.

THE Dominicans, regardlcfs of such political Contrary

decisions

and interested considerations, would not relax in c.nccrning
any degree the rigour of their sentiments, and ti's poi
even refused to ablblve, or admit to the sacra-
ments, such of their countrymen as held the na-
tives in servitude". Both parties applied to the
king for his decision in a matter of such import-
ance. Ferdinand empowered a committee of his
privy-council, allifled by some of the most emi-

v- --- deputies sent from Hispaniola, in support of their
'Sy'' refpe&ive opinions. After a long dilcuflion, the

speculative point in controversy was determined in
favour of the Dominicans, the Indians were de-
clared to be a free people, intitled to all the natu-
ral rights of men; bur, notwithltanding this
decision, the reprrlimnientos were continued upon
their ancient footing w. As this determination ad-
mitted the principle upon which the Dominicans
founded their opinion, it was not calculated either
to silence or to convince them. At length, in
order to quiet the colony, which was alarmed by
their remonstrances and cenlures, Ferdinand iflued
a decrie of his privy-council, declaring, that after
mature consideration of the Apoflolic Bull, and
s5T3. other titles by which the crown of Castile claimed

a right to its porffciuiis I1 the New W\orld, the
servitude of the Indians was warranted both by the
laws of God and of man; that unless they were
fubjefled to the doinmiloii of the Spaniarcs, and
compelled to reside under their iiilpcCion, it
would be impoifible to reclaim them from ido-
latry, or to inltrult them in the principles of the
Chrifian faiith; that no fartrher feruple ought to

an excess of charitable, but ill-informed zeal, '5S7.
they had uttered against that practice Y.

THAT his intention of adhering to this decree
miiht be fully underfood, Ferdinand conferred
new grants of Indians upon several of his cour-
tiers z. But, in order that he might not seem alto-
gtther inattentive to the rights of humanity, he
publifled an edict, in which he endeavoured to
Frovide for the mild treatment of the Indians un-
der the yoke to which he fubjecded them; he re-
gulated the nature of the work which they should
be required to perform, he prescribed the mode
in which they should be clothed and frd, and gave
directions wi;h relped to their iiltruEtion in the
principles of Chriltianity a.

of what was pall, judged concerning the future, t,'.
boon perceived the inefficacy of thole provisions,
and foretold, that as long as it was the interest of
injividu.ils to treat the Indians with rigour, no

executing his resolution. Charles of Auitria, to
whom all his crowns devolved, resided at that time
in his paternal dominions in the Low Countries.
Las Calas, with his usual ardour, prepared imme-
diately to set out for Slanders, in order to occupy
the ear of the young monarch, when cardinal
Ximenes, who, as regent, assumcd the reins of
government in Castile, commanded him to drifl
from the journey, and engaged to hear his conm
plaints in person.

dinal Xi- tion equal to its importance; and as his impetuous

he soon fixed upon a plan which aflonifhed the
miniflers, trained up under the formal and cautious
adminil ration of Ferdinand. Without regariiiig

after examining all circumstances on the spot, to B 0 0 K
decide finally with refpea to the point in question.
It was a matter of deliberation and delicacy to 15'7.
chufe men qualified for such an important station.
As all the laymen fettled in America, or who had
been consulted in the adminifiration of that de-
partment, had given their opinion that the Spa-
niards could not keep poffclion of their new fettle-
ments, unless they were allowed to retain their
dominion over the Indians, he saw that he could
not rely on their impartiality, and determined to
commit the trust to ecclesiastics. As the Domi-
nicans and Franciscans had already eSpoused oppo-
site fides in the controversy, he, from the fame
principle, excluded both thele fraternities from
the commission. He confined his choice to the
monks of St. Jerome, a small, but refpeaable
order in Spain. With the afliftance of their gene-
ral, and in concert with Las Calas, he soon pitched
upon three perlbns whom he deemed equal to the
charge. To them he joined Zuazo, a private
lawyer of diftinguilhed probity, with unbounded
power to regulate all judicial proceedings in the
colonies. Las Casas was appointed to accompany
them, with the title of Proteóor of the Indians '.

c_ -^-_ to possess this high authority, appeared to Zapata,

5J17' and other miniflers of the late king, a measure so

wild and dangerous, that they refused to issue the
dispatches necessary for carrying it into execution.
But Ximenes was not of a temper patiently to
brook opposition to any of his schemes. He sent
for the refracory ministers, and addressed them in
such a tone, that in the utmost consternation they
obeyed his orders f. The superintendents, with
their associate Zuazo, and Las Casas, failed for
St. Domingo. Upon their arrival, the first act of
their authority was to set at liberty all the Indians
who had been granted to the Spaniff courtiers, or
to any person not residing in America. This, to.
gether with the information which had been re.
ceived from Spain concerning the objec of the
commission, spread a general alarm. The colonils
concluded that they were to be deprived at once
of the hands with which they carried on their la.
bour, and that, of consequence, ruin was unavoid-
able. But the fathers of St. Jerome proceeded
with such caution and prudence, as soon dissipated
all their fears. They discovered, in every ftep of
their conduct, a knowledge of the world, and of
affairs, which is seldom acquired in a cloitecr; and
displayed a moderation and gentleness fill more
rare among persons trained up in the solitude and
austerity of a monaffic life. Their ears were open

to information from every quarter, they compared B o o K
the different accounts which they received, and, -
after a mature conlideration of the whole, they '517'
were fully satisfied that the state of the colony ren-
dered it impossible to adopt the plan propoled by
Las Casas, and recommended by the cardinal.
They plainly perceived that the Spaniards fettled
in America were so few in number, that they
could neither work the mines which had been
opened, nor cultivate the country; that they de-
pended for both upon the labour of the natives,
and, if deprived of it, they mult instantly relinquifi
their conquests, or give up all the advantages
which they derived from them; that no allure-
ment was so powerful as to surmount the natural
aversion of the Indians to any laborious effort, and
that nothing but the authority of a master could
compel them to work; and if they were not kept
constantly under the eye and discipline of a fu-
perior, so great was their natural liltleffnefs and
indifference, that they would neither attend to
religious inltrulion, nor observe those rites of
Christianity which they had been already taught.
Upon all those accounts, the superintendents
found it necessary to tolerate the repartimicl:tos,
and to susser the Indians to remain under subjec-
tion to their Spani(h matters. They used their
utmost endeavours, however, to prevent the fatal
effeEts of this eltablifhinent, and to secure the In-
dians the consolation of the belt treatment compa-
tible with a slate of servitude. For this purpolfc:

by their authority, their example, and their ex-
hortations, they laboured to inspire their country-
men with sentiments of equity and gentleners, to-
wards the unhappy people upon whose industry
they depended. Zuazo, in his department,
seconded the endeavours of the superintendents.
He reformed the courts ofjuftice, in such a man-
ner as to render their decisions equitable as well as
expeditious, and introduced various regulations
which greatly improved the interior police of the
colony. The fatisfation which his conduct, and
that of the superintendents gave, was now univer-
fal among the Spaniards fettled in the New World,
and all admired the boldness of Ximenes, in hav-
ing departed from the ordinary path of business in
forming his plan, as well as his sagacity, in pitch-
ing upon persons, whole wisdom, moderation, and
disinterestedness, rendered them worthy of this
high trust g.

to their own syRem. The Spanish planters did not
bear with him so patiently, and were ready to tear
him in pieces for infiting in a requisition so odious
to them. Las Casas, in order to screen himself
from their rage, found it necelary to take Ilhelter
in a convent; and perceiving that all his efforts in
America were fruitless, he fton set out for Europe,

preparing to resign his authoiity to the young
king, who was daily expc'tcd from the Low Coun-
tries. Charles arrived, took poffcflion of the go-

Am!cri:,ln afairs was an objeEt too alluring to
escape th ir attention. Las Casas observed their
growing influence, and though proje'tors are ufu-
ally too sanguine to condu&t their schemes with
nmuch d-xterity, he possessed a buflling indefati-
gable activity, which sometimes accomplishes its
purposes with greater success, than the most ex-
quifite discernment and addrels. He courted the
Flermifn ministers with assiduity. He reprefcnted
to them the absurdity of all the maxims hitherto
adopted with refpe&t to the government of Ame.
rica, and particularly the detfets of that arrange-
ment which Ximenes had introduced. The me-
mory of Ferdinand was odious to the Flemings.
The superior virtue and abilities of Ximenes had
long been the object of their envy. They fondly
wished to have a plausible pretext for condemning
the meiafures, both of the monarch and of the mi-
nilter, and of refleting tome discredit on their po.

his Icheme, Las Casas propoled to purchase a luf-

port them to America, in order that they might be

T 3 Various

B 0 K Various circumitances concurred in reviving this
»-v-' odious commerce, which had long been abolified

5'7.' in Europe, and which is no less repugnant to the

feelings of humanity, than to the principles of re-
ligion. As early as the year one thousand five
hundred and three, a few negroe slaves had been
sent into the New World k. In the year one thou-
sand five hundred and eleven, Ferdinand permitted
the importation of them in greater numbers '. They
were found to be a more robust and hardy race
than the natives of America. They were more
capable of enduring fatigue, more patient under
servitude, and the labour of one negro was com-
puted to be equal to that of four Indians ". Car-
dinal Ximenes, however, when solicited to en-
courage this commerce, peremptorily rejected the
proposition, because he perceived the iniquity of
reducing one race of men to slavery, while he was
consulting about the means of restoring liberty to
another ". But Las Casas, from the inconsistency
natural to men who hurry with headlong impecuo-
fity towards a favourite point, was incapable of
making this diftintion. While he contended ear-
neftly for the liberty of the people born in one
quarter of the globe, he laboured to enslave the
inhabitants of another region; and in the warmth
of his zeal to save the Americans from the yoke,
pronounced it to be lawful and expedient to iin-

fold his patent to fume Genoese merchants for
twenty-five thouland ducats, and they were the
first who brought into a regular form that com-
merce for slaves between Africa and America,

ing extent .

BUT the Genoese merchants, conducaing their Lsr51a
operations, at firti, with the rapacity of mono- propofre

lending la-

polilts, demanded such an high price for negroes, bourr to
that the number imported into Hispaniola made Hispaniola.
no great change upon the slate of the colony.
Las Casas, whose zeal was no less inventive than
indefatigable, had recourse to another expedient
for the relief of the Indians. He obfcrved, that
mofi of the persons who had fettled hitherto in
America, were soldiers and tailors employed in the
discovery or conquest of the country ; the younger
sons of noble families, allured by the profpet of
acquiring sudden wealth ; or desperate adventurers,
whom their indigence or crimes forced to abandon
their native land. Instead of such men, who were
difiblute, rapacious, and incapable of that obber
persevering induttry which is requisite in forming

who should be allured by suitable premiums to re-
move thither. These, as they were accustomed
to fatigue, would be able to perform the work, to
which the Indians, from the feebleness of their
constitution, were unequal, and might soon be-
come useful and opulent citizens. But though
Hispaniola flood much in need of a recruit of in-
habitants, having been visited at this time with the
small-pox, which fwcpt off many of the natives,
and though Las Casas had the countenance of the
Flemish ministers, this scheme was defeated by the
biflop of Burgos, who thwarted all his projects P.

Forms the LAS CASAS now despaired of procuring any re-
idrea of a
ipw colony. lief for the Indians in those places where the Spa-

niards were already fettled. The evil was become
so inveterate there, as not to admit of a cure. But
such discoveries were daily making in the conti-
nent, as gave an high idea both of its extent and
populousness. In all those vatl regions there was
Lur one feeble colony planted ; and except a 1in)all
Ifot on the illhmus of Darien, the natives till oc-

of this idea, he applied for a grant of the unoccu-
pied country, stretching along the lea-coaft from 5'L'
the gulf of Paria to the wcetern frontier of that
province now known by the name of Santa Mar-
tha. He proposed to fettle there with a colony
composed of husbandmen, labourers, and ecclefi-
aflics. He engaged, in the lpace of two years, to
civilize ten thousand of the natives, and to initr-uct
them lb thoroughly in the arts of social life, that,
from the fruits of their induitry, an annual revenue
of fifteen thousand ducats should arise to the king.
In ten years he expected that his improvements
would be so far advanced, as to yield annually
sixty thousand ducats. lie stipulated, that no
tailor or soldier should ever be permitted to fettle
in this diftri&t; and that no Spaniard should enter

tome peculiar garment, which did not rel-mble the
Spanish dress, that they might appear to the na-
tives to be a different race of men from thole who
had brought so many calamities upon their coun-
try' . From this scheme, of which I have traced
only the great lines, it is manifcft that Las Casas
had formed ideas concerning the method of treat-

the Indies this projec appeared not only chimerical,
but dangerous in a high degree. They deemed
the faculties of the Americans to be naturally so
limited, and their indolence so excessive, that any
attempt to instruct or improve them would be fruit-
less. They contended, that it would be extreme-
ly imprudent to give the command of a country
extending above a thousand miles along the coall,
to a fanciful, presumptuous enthusiast, a firanger
to the affairs of the world, and unacquainted with
the arts of government. Las Casas, far from be-
ing discouraged with a repulse, which he had rea-
son to expect, had recourse once more to the Fle-
mifh favourites, who zealously patronized his
scheme, merely becaulf it had been rejeRed by
the Spanifi minilters. They prevailed with their
master, who had lately been railed to the Imperial
dignity, to refer the consideration of this measure
to a select number of his privy-counfellors; and as
Las Calas excepted againfL the members of the
council of the Indies, as partial and interefled, they
were all excluded. The decision of men choicn

ments concerning the talents and disposition of the
Indians differed from thole of Las Casas; and
Charles naturally concluded, that by confronting
two respectable persons, who, during their refi.
dence in America, had full leilure to observe the
manners of the people whom they pretended to de-
scribe, he might be able to discover which of them
had formed his opinion with the greatell discern.
ment and accuracy.

A DAY for this solemn audience was appointed.

The emperor appeared wvih extraordinary pomp,
and took his feat on a throne in the grcat hall of
the palace. His principal courtiers attended. Don
Diego Columbus, admiral of the Indies, was fiml-
moned to be present. The bishop of Darien was
called upon first to deliver his opinion. He, in a
short dilcourfe, lamented the far,:; d(eilaion of
America, by the exincEtion of ob many of its inha-
bitants; he acknow!edged that this muri be imr
putecd, in fonle (degee, to the cxceflive rigour and
inconsiderate proceedlings of the Spaniards; but
declared, that all the pcople of the New \Voril,

cd out, by the inferiority oF their talents, for fIr-

the continual infpeftion of a mafler. Las Casas, B Cr;, K
at great length, and with more fervour, defrnded --, _
his own fyftcm. He rejected with indignation the 57
idea that any race of men was born to servitude, as
irreligious and inhumane. I-.e afTerted, that the
faculties of the Americans were not naturally defpi-
cable, but unimproved ; that they were capable of
receiving inftrue-ion in the principles of religion,
as well as of acquiring the indufry and arts which
would qualify them for the various offices offocial
life; that the mildnels and timidity of their na-
ture rendered them io ifubmiifive and docile, th:a
they might be led andt formed with a gentle hand.
He professed, that his intentions in proposing the
scheme now under consideration were pure and dif-
interested; and though, from the accomplifhient
of his designs, inefimnable benefits would result to
the crown of Caflile, he never had claimed, nor
ever would receive any recoinpence on that ac-
count.

touched was the illand of Puerto Rico. There he
received an account of a new obstacle to the execu-
tion of his scheme, more insuperable than any he
had hitherto encountered. When he left America
in the year one thousand five hundred and sixteen,
the Spaniards had little intercourse with any part
of the continent, except the countries adjacent to
the gulf of Darien. But as every species of inter-
nal indultry began to flagnate in -lifpaniola, when,

hitherto carried on their operations, this prompted A_
them to try various expedients for supplying that '5'7
loss. Considerable numbers of negroes were im-
ported; but, on account of their exorbitant price,
many of the planters could not afford to purchase
them. In order to procure slaves at an easier rate,
some of thele fitted out vessels to cruize along the
coafl of the continent. In places where they found
themselves inferior in strength, they traded with
the natives, and gave European toys in exchange
for the plates of gold worn by them as ornaments;
but, wherever they could surprise or overpower
the Indians, they carried them off by force, and
bold them as slaves in Hilpaniola . In those pre-
datory excursions, the moit atrocious ads of vio-
lence and cruelty were committed. The Spanilh
name was held in detestation all over the conti-
nent. Whenever any ihips appeared, the inhabit-
ants either fled to the woods, or rushed down to
the shore in arms, to repel those hated diflurbers
of their tranquillity. They forced rome parties of
the Spaniards to retreat with precipitation; they
cut off others; and in the violence of their resent-
ment againt: the whole natiin, they murdered two

met with in Hispaniola was very unfavourable. In

tion of their own actions. But that people, ac.
customed to a mode of life extremely different, in-
cap.ible of assuming new habits at once, and de-
jetced with their own misfortunes as well as those
of their country, exerted so little industry in culti-
vating the ground, appeared so devoid of solicitude
or foresight in providing for their own wants, and
were such 1trangers to arrangement in conducting
their affairs, that the Spaniards pronounced them
incapable of being formed to live like men in so-
cial life, and confidered them as children, who
should be kept under the perpetual tutelage of
perlbns superior to themselves in wifdorm and fa-
gacity r.

-v--' body of troops to protect him and his colony at

5 their first landing. But upon his return to Puerto

Rico, he found that the diseases of the climate had
been fatal to fcveral of his people ; and that others
having got employment in that island, refused to
follow him. With the handful that remained, he
set fail and landed in Cumana. Ocampo had exe-
cuted his commission in that province with such
barbarous rage, having massacred many of the in-
habitants, sent others in chains to Hispaniola, and
forced the reft to fly for shelter to the woods, that
the people of a small colony, which he had planted
at a place which he named Toledo, were ready to
perish for want in a desolate country. There,
however, Las Casas was obliged to fix his refi-
dence, though deserted both by the troops ap-
pointed to protect him, and by those under the
command of Ocampo, who foresaw and dreaded
the calamities to which he muff be exposed in that
wretched flation. He made the best provision in
his power for the safety and fubliltence of his fol-
lowers i but as his utmnoft efforts availed little to-
wards iccuring either the one or the other, he re-
tlurned to IIlijaniola, in order to solicit more effec-
tual aid for the preservation of men, who from con-
fidence in him had ventured into a pofL of lo much
danger. Soon after his departure, the natives,
having discovercd the feeble and defencelels hIats
of the Slpanilar!s, afli-mbled fecrctly, attacked them
with the fury natural to men exasperated by many

on account of the pearl finfery, catching the panic
with which their countrymen had been seized,
abandoned the ifand, and not a Spa;niard remain-
ed in any part of the continent, or adjacent ilands,

I return now to the history of the Spanish disco.
veries, as they occur in the order of time a.

veie to- DIEGO VELASQUEZ, who conquered Cuba in the

coverds to-
wards the year one thousand five hundred and eleven, frill

retained the government of that island, as the de-
puty of Don Diego Columbus, though he seldom
acknowledged his superior, and aimed at rendering
his own authority altogether independent b. Under
his prudent administration, Cuba became one of
the most flourishing of the Spanish settlements.
The fame of this allured many persons from the
other colonies thither, in hopes of finding either
some permanent establishment, or some employ-
ment for their activity. As Cuba lay to the weft
of all the islands occupied by the Spaniards, and as
the ocean, which stretches beyond it towards that
quarter, had not hitherto been explored, these cir-
cumftances naturally invited the inhabitants to at-
tempt new discoveries. An expedition for this pur-
pose, in which ativity and resolution might con-
dut to sudden wealth, was more suited to the ge-
nius of the age, than the patient indufiry requisite
in clearing ground, and manufaturing sugar. In-
ftigated by this spirit, several officers, who had
served under Pclrarias in Darien, entered into an
affociatiun to undertake a voyage of dilcovery.

6 They

They persuaded Francisco Hernandez Cordova, an B O o K
opulent planter in Cuba, and a man of distinguish-
ed courage, to join with them in the adventure, 5.7'
and chose him to be their commander. Velasquez
not only approved of the design, but aflifted in
carrying it on. As the veterans from Darien were
extremely indigent, he and Cordova advanced
money for purchasing three small veflels, and fur-
nifhing them with every thing requisite either for
traffic or for war. A hundred and ten men em-
barked on board of them, and failed from St. Jago
de Cuba on the eighth of February one thousand
five hundred and seventeen. By the advice of their
chief pilot, Antonio Alaminos, who had served
under the first admiral Columbus, they flood di-
rectly weft, relying on the opinion of that great
navigator, who uniformly maintained that a weft-
erly course would lead to the most important dif-
coveries.

ON the twentv-firfl day after their departure

from St. Jago, they saw land, which proved to be
Cape Catoche, the eastern point of that large pe-
ninfula projecting fiom the continent of America,
which fIill retains its original name of ucatan. As Yucatan.
they approached the shore, five canoes came off
full of people decently clad in cotton garments;
an astonishing spectacle to the Spaniards, who had
found every other part of America possessed by
naked savages. Cordova endeavoured by finall
prefcnts to gain the good-will of thece people.

U 3 They,

o o0o K They, though amazed at the strange objecs now

presented for the first time to their view, invited
'517t the Spaniards to visit their habitations, with an

appearance of cordiality. They landed accord-
ingly, and as they advanced into the country, they
observed with new wonder some large houses built
with stone. But they soon found that, if the people
of Yucatan had made progress in improvement be-
yond their countrymen, they were likewilfe more
artful and warlike. For thouth the cazique re-
ceived Cordova with many tokens of friendship,
he had polled a considerable body of his subjects
in ambush behind a thicket, who, upon a signal
given by him, ruffed out and attacked the Spa-
niards wih great boldness, and some degree of
martial order. At the first flight of their arrows,
fifteen of the Spaniards were wounded; but the
Indians were itruck with such terror by the sudden
explosion of the fire-arms, and lo surprised at the
execution do:e by them, by the cross-bows, al;d
by the other weapons of their new enemies, that
zro. they fled precipitately. Cordova quitted a coun-

try where he lhad met with such a fierce reception,
carrying off two prisoners, together with the orna-
ments of a frnall temple, which he plundered in
his retreat.

IIE continued his courfc towards the weft with-

out losing figii of the coaf-, and on the fixteentl
C,,,,ic.iiy, day arrived at Campeacliy. There the natives re-

ccived

ceived them more hospitably; but the Spaniards B ° o K
were much surprised, that on all the extensive coast --.-
along which they had failed, and which they ima- '50'
gined to be a large island, they had not observed
any river'. As their water began to fail, they ad-
vanced, in hopes of finding a supply ; and at length
they discovered the mouth of a river at Potonchan,
some leagues beyond Campeachy.

CORDOVA landed all his troops in order to pro-

teEt the sailors while employed in filling the caiks
but notwithflanding this precaution, the natives
rushed down upon them with such fury, and in
such numbers, that forty seven of the Spaniards
were killed upon the spot, and one man only of
the whole body cfcaped unhurt. Their commander,
though wounded in twelve different places, di-
rected the retreat with presence of mind equal to
the courage with which he had led them on in the
engagement, and with much difficulty they regain-
ed their Ihips. After this fatal repulle, nothing
remained but to haften back to Cuba with their
shattered forces. In their passage thither they sus-
sered the molt cxquifite diltrdes for want of water,
that men wounded and sickly, slut up in small
veflels, and exposed to the heat of the torrid zone,
can be lul)p!old to endure. Some of them, linlk,

Voyage of NOTWITHSTANDING the disastrous conclusion of
Grjalva,

this expedition, it contributed rather to animate
than to damp a spirit of enterprize among the
Spaniards. They had discovered an extensive
country, situated at no great distance from Cuba,
fertile in appearance, and possessed by a people far
superior in improvement to any hitherto known in
America. Tholgh they had carried on little com-
mercial intercourse with the natives, they had
brought off some ornaments of gold, not confider-
able in value, bur of singular fabric. These cir-
cumfrances, related with the exaggeration natural
to men desirous ot heightening the merit of their
own exploits, were more than sufficient to excite
romantic hopes and expectaaions Great numbers
offered to engage in anew expedition. Velasquez,
Solicitous to distinguish himfilf by tome service so
meritorious, as might entitle him to claim the go-
vernment of Cuba independent of the admiral, not
only encouraged their ardour, but at his own ex-
pence fitted out four ships for the voyage. Two
hundred and forty volunteers, among whom were
several perlons of rank and fortune, embarked in
this entcrprife. The command of it was given to

Juan de Grijalva, a young man of known merit B 0 o K
and courage, with inftrutions to observe with at- A
tention the nature of the countries which he (hould 5.9'
discover, to barter for gold, and if circumstances
were inviting, to fettle a colony in some proper
Ration. He failed from Sc. Jago de Cuba on the
eighth of April one thousand five hundred and Is5.
eighteen. The pilot Alaminos held the fame Difcoers
course as in the former voyage; but the violence Newspain.
of the currents carrying the ships to the south, the
filft land which they made was the island of Cozu-
mel, to the ealt of Yucatan. As all the inhabit- MPay .
ants fled to the woods and mountains at the ap-
proach of the Spaniards, they made no long flay
there, and, without any remarkable occurrence,
they reached Potonchan on the opposite fide of the
peninsula. The desire of avenging their country-
men who had been slain there, concurred with
their ideas of good policy, in prompting them to
land, that they might chastise the Indians of that
diftriC with such exemplary rigour, as would
firike terror into all the people around them. But
though they disembarked all their troops, and
carried ashore some field-pieces, the Indians
fought with such courage, ti.at the Spaniards
gained the victory with difficulty, and were con-
firmed in their opinion, that the inhabitants of this
country would prove more formidable enemies than
any they had met with in other parts of America.
From lPotonchan, they continued their voyage to-
wards the weli, keeping as near as possible to the

shore,

B 0 0 K fllore, and carling anchor every evening, from
'---' dread of the dangerous accidents to which they

51 ' might be exposed in an unknown sea. During the

day, their eyes were turned continually towards
land, with a mixture of surprise and wonder at the
beauty of the country, as well as the novelty of the
objects which they beheld. Many villages were
scattered along the coast, in which they could di-
tlinguifh houses of stone that appeared white and
lofty at a diltance. In the warmth of their admira-
tion, they fancied these to be cities adorned with
towers and pinnacles; and one of the soldiers hap-
pening to remark that this country resembled Spain
in its appearance, Grijalva, with universal ap-
plause, called it Ncw Spain, the name which frill
distinguishes this extcnfive and opulent province of

June 9. the Spanish empire in America. They landed in a
Tabasco. river which the natives called Tabasco, and the

fame of their vicory at Potonchan having reached
this place, the cacique not only received them ami-
cably, but bellowed presents upon them of such
value, as confirmed the high ideas which the Spa-
niards had formed with refleet to the wealth and
fertility of the country. Thele ideas were railied
still highicr by what occurred at the place where
they next touched. This was considerably to the
weft of Tabasco, in the province since knovwn by
"Xara. the name of Guaxaca. There they were received

with respeCt paid to fupcrior beings. The people
perfumed them as they Ilanded with incenie of
gumi copal, and prelfntced to them as offerings the

choiccit

choicest delicacies of their country. They were B O o K
extremely fond of trading with their new visitants, _
and in fix days the Spaniards obtained ornaments 15ss
of gold, of curious workmanfniip, to the value of
fifteen thousand pesos, in exchange for European
toys of small price. The two prisoners whom Cor-
dova had brought from Yucatan, had hitherto
served as interpreters; but as they did not under-
Rand the language of this country, the Spianiards
learned from the natives by signs, that they were
fubje-ts of a great monarch called Montezuma,
whole dominion extended over that and many
other provinces. Leaving this place, with which
he had so much reason to be pleased, Giijalva
continued his course towards the well. He landed June I9
on a frall island, which he named the Ife of Sa-
crifices, because there the Spaniards beheld, for
the firlt time, the horrid fpe&acle of human vic-
tims, which the barbarous fuperfltiton of the na-
tives oflered to their gods. He touched at another
small ifand, which he called St. Juan de Ulua St. uandc
From this place he difpatclicd Pedro de Alvarado, U
one of his officers, to Velasquez, with a full ac-
count of the important dilcoveries which he
had made, and with all the treasure that he
had acquired by traflicking with the natives.
After the departure of Alvarado, he Iiiml'lf,
with the remaining vcffels, proceeded along the
coast as far as the river Panuco, the country
fill appearing to be well peopled, fertile, and
opulent.

SEVERAL

B 0 0 K SEVERAL of Grijalva's officers contended, that
L^-^- it was not enough to have discovered those delight-
Rearfor fur l regions, or to have performed, at their different
rt leaving landing-places, the empty ceremony of taking pof-
a colony
thbcr. session of them for the crown of Castile, and that

their glory was incomplete, unless they planted a
colony in some proper station, which might not
only secure the Spanifl nation a footing in the
country, but, with the reinforcements which they
were certain of receiving, might gradually subject
the whole to the dominion of their sovereign. But
the squadron had now been above five months at
sea; the greatest part of their provisions was ex-
haufted, and what remained of their flores so much
corrupted by the heat of the climate, as to be
almost unfit for use; they had loft some men by
death; others were sickly ; the country was crowd-
ed with people who seemed to be intelligent as well
as brave; and they were under the government of
one powerful monarch, who could bring them to
act against their invaders with united force. To
plant a colony under so many circumstances of
disadvantage, appeared a scheme too perilous to
be attempted. Grijalva, though poffffed both of
ambition and courage, was dcflitute of the superior
talents capable of forming or executing such a
great plan. He judged it more prudent to return
to Cuba, having fulfilled the purpose of his voyage,
and accomplilhed all that the armament which he
commanded enabled him to perform. He returned
to St. Jago de Cuba, on the twnty-fixth of Oco-

ber,

ber, from which he had taken his departure about B o0 K
fix months before. e-

1518.
THIS was the longest as well as the most fuc- Preparationa

for another

cefsful voyage which the Spaniards had hitherto expedition.
made in the New World. They had discovered
that Yucatan was not an island as they had sup-
posed, but part of the great continent of America.
From Potonchan they had pursued their course for
many hundred miles along a coast formerly unex-
plored, firetching at first towards the weft, and
then turning to the north; all the country which
they had discovered appeared to be no less va-
luable than extensive. As soon as Alvarado
reached Cuba, Velasquez, transported with success
so far beyond his most sanguine expecations, im-
mediately dispatchel a person of confidence to
carry this important intelligence to Spain, to ex-
hibit the rich productions of the countries which
had been discovered by his means, and to solicit
such an increase of authority as might enable and
encourage him to attempt the conquest of them.
Without waiting for the return of his messenger,
or for the arrival of Grijalva, of whom he was be.
come so jealous or dill-uftful that he resolved no
longer to employ him, he began to prepare such a
powerful armament, as might prove equal to an
enterprise of so much danger and importance.

people, who, if compared with such of the Ame.

highly civilised; it is proper to pause before we
proceed to the history of events extremely difcerent
from those which we have already related, in order
to take a view of the fiate of the New World when
first discovered, and to contemplate the policy and
manners of the rude uncultivated tribes, that cc-

T YRE was situated at such a dillance from thd

Arabian Gulf or Red Sea, as made it impracticable

to convey commodities from thence to that city by land-
carriage. This induced the Phenicians to render them-
selves masters of Rhinocrura, or Rhinocolura, the nearest
port in the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. They landed
the cargoes which they purchased in Arabia, Ethiopia,
and India, at Elath, the safest harbour in the Red Sea
towards the north. Thence they were carried by land
to Rhinocolura, the distance not being very considerable;
and being refhipped in that port, were transported to

T ItE Periplus Hannonis is the only authentic monu-

ment of the Carthaginian fcill in naval affairs, and

one of the most curious fiagments transmittcd to us by
antiquity. The learned and industrious Mr. Dodwell,
in a diflcrtation prefixed to the Periplus of Flanno, in the
edition of the Minor Geographers publifllcd at Oxford,

VOL. I. X Cnldeavours

endeavours to prove that this is a spurious work, the
composition of some Greek, who aflumed Hanno's name.
But M. de Montesquieu, in his l'Efprit des Loix, liv. xxi.
c. 8. and M. de Bougainville, in a diflertation published
tom. xxvi. of the IMemoires de 1'Academie des Infcrip-
tions, &c. have eftabliihed its authenticity by arguments
which to me appear unanswerable. Ramufio has accom-
panied his translation of this curious voyage with a differ-
tation tending to illuitrate it. Racolte de Viaggi, vol. i.
p. 112. M. de Bougainville has, with great learning
and ability, treated the fame fubjecs. It appears that
Hanno, according to the mode of ancient navigation,
undertook this voyage in finall vesSels, so confiruCted that
he could keep close in with the coafr. He failed from
Gades to the island of Cerne in twelve days. This is
probably what is known to the moderns by the name of
the Ifne of Arguim. It became the chief ifation of the
Carthaginians on that coast; and M. de Bougainville
contends, that the ciflerns found there are monuments of
the Carthaginian power and ingenuity. Proceeding from
Cerne, and till following the winding of the coafi, he
arrived, in feventcen days, at a promontory which he
called The 1Fjt I-rl., probably Cape Palmas. From
this he advanced to another promontory, which he named
The South Horn, and which is manifeIlly Cape de Tres
Puntas, about five degrees north of the line. All the
circumstances contained in the short abflr-at of his jour-
nal, which is handed down to us, concerning the appear-
ance and slate of the coiiiIries o01 the coafl of Afiica, arc
confirmed and illustratcd by a comparison with the ac-
counts of modern navigators. Even those circutnlfl-;lcics,
which, fiom their te'cmiig, imlprobability, have been pro-
duced to invalidate the credibility of his relation, tcnd to
confirm it. He oblcrves, that in the country to thec louth
of Cerne, a profound filcnce reigned tiroaghtilhe day;

h ut

but during the night, innumerable fires were kindled
along tle banks of the rivers, and the air resounded with
the noise of pipes and drums, and cries of joy. The
fame thing, as Ramufio observes, still takes place. The
excessive heat obliges the negroes to take shelter in the
woods, or in their houfcs, during the day. As soon as
the fun sets, they tally out, and by torch-light enjoy the
pleasure of music and dancing, in which they spend the
night. Ramus. i. Ir3, F. In another place, he men-
tions the sea as burning with torrents of fire. What oc-
curred to M. Adanfon, on the fame coast, may explain
this. " As soon," fays he, " as the fun dipped beneath
the horizon, and night overspread the earth with dark-
nets, the sea lent us its friendly light. While the prow
of our vessel ploughed the foaming surges, it seemed to set
them all on fire. Thus we failed in a luminous inclofure,
which surrounded us like a large circle of rays, from
whence darted in the wake of the ship a long ifream of
light." Voy. to Senegal, p. 176.

any thing with certainty concerning the form and itate of
the southern parts of Africa. Geogr. lib. xvii. p. ii80.
Ptolemy, the mofi inquisitive and learned of all the ancient
geographers, was equally unacquainted with any part of
Africa situated a few degrees beyond the equinotial line;
for he supposes that this great continent was not fur-
rounded by the sea, but that it firetched, without inter-
ruption, towards the south pole: and he so far mistakes
its true figure, that he describes the continent as becom-
ing broader and broader as it advanced towards the south.

A FACT, recorded by Strabo, affords a very firong and

singular proof of the ignorance of the ancients with

refpc& to the situation of the various parts of the earth.
XWhen Alexander marched along the banks of the Hy-
dafpes and Acefine, two of the rivers which fall into the
Indus, hu obfcrved that there were many crocodiles in
those rivers, and that the country produced beans of the
fame species with those which were common in Egypt.
From thcl circuiimlanccs, he concluded that he had dif-
covered the fotrcc of tlih Nile, and prepared a fleet to
fail down the Ilydafpes to Egypt. Strab. Geor. lib. xv.
p. I020. This an;laing error did not arif from any ig-
norance of geography peculiar to that monarch ; for we
are informed by Strabo, that Alexnnder applied with par-
ticular attention in order to acquire the knowledge of thi:;
fcicncc, and had accurate maps or dclcriptiols of the

countries

NOTE VI. p. 24.

T is probable that the ancients were seldom induced to
advance so far, either by motives of curiosity, or views

of commerci:l advantage. In consequence of this, their
idea concerning the position of that great river was very
erroneous. Ptolemy places that branch of the Ganges
which he diffinguifhes by the name of the Great Mouth,
in the hundred and forty-fixth degree of longitu.de from
his first meridian in the Fortunate Islands. But its true
longitude, computed from that meridian, is now deter-
mined by aflronomical observations to be only a hundred
and five degrees. A geographer so eminent mutt have
been betrayed into an error of this magnitude by the im-
perfection of the information which he had received con-
cerning those diflant regions; and this affords a striking
proof of the intercourse with them being extremely rare.
With rcfpecl to the countries of India beyond the G(angs,
his intelligence was fill more defcEtive, ;and his errors
more enormous. I shall have occasion to obfcr\e in an-
other place, that he has placed the country of the Seres,
or Chitna, no le's than sixty degrees farther ealt than its
true position. M. d'A nville, one of the moai learned and

X 3 intelligent

intelligent of the modern geographers, has set this matter
in a clear light, in two dilfertations published in Mem. de
l'Academ. des Infcript. &c. tom. xxxii. p. 573. 604.

T is remarkable, that the discoverics of the ancielnt
were made chiefly by land; those of the moderns are

carried on chiefly by sea. The progress of conquest lkd
to the former, that of commerce to the latter. It is a
judicious observation of Strabo, that the conquests of
Alexander the Great made known the East, those of the
Romans opened the WVeff, and those of Mithridates king
of Pontus the North. Lib. i. p. 26. When discovery
is carried on by land alone, its progress must be flow,
and its operations confined. When it is carried on only
by sea, its fpherc may be more extcnfive, and its advances
more rapid; but it labours under peculiar defects. Though
it may make known the polition of different countries,
and afcert.iin their boundaries as far as these are deter-
mined by the ocean, it leaves us in ignorance with re-
fpedt to their interior slatc. Above two centuries ,Ild a
half have elapsed since the Europeans lailed round the
southern promontory of Africa, and have traded in Inoft
of its ports; but, in a conliderable part of that great con-
tinent, they have done little more than furvcy its coatis,
and mark its capes and harbours. Its interior rcgi(os
arc in a great mceafire unknown. The ancients, vwho
had a very imnperfcd knowlcdge of its coasts, except
where they are waflled by the Mediterranean or Red Seia,
were accultolcd to penetrate into its inland provinces,
and, if we may rely on the tcltimony of Herodotus and
I)iodorus Siculus, had explored mnany parts of it now al
together unknown. Unlcfs both modes of discovery be

united, the geographical knowledge of the earth must re-
main inconplete and inaccurate.

T IH E notion of the ancients concerning such an cx-

cefive degree of heat in the torrid zone, as rendered

it uninhabitable, and their pcrfifling in this error long
after they began to have some commercial intcrcotu'fe
with fevcral parts of India lying within the tropics, must,
appear so singular and absurd, that it may not be unac-
ceptable to some of my readers to produce evidence of
their holding this opinion, and to account for the apparent
inconfifience of their theory with their experience. Ci-
cero, who had bestowed attention upon every part of
philosophy known to the ancients, seems to have believed
that the torrid zone was uninhabitable, and, of confe-
quence, that there could be no intcrcourfe between the
northern and southern temperate zones. HIc introduces
Africanus thus addressing the younger Scipio: " You fee
this earth cncompaffed, and as it were bound in by certain
zones, of which two, at the greatest distance from each
other, and fufltaining the opposite poles of heaven, are
frozen with perpetual cold; the middle one, and the
largest of all, is burnt with the heat of the fun ; two are
habitable, the people in the southern one are antipodes to
us, with whom we have no connelion." Somnlirn Sci-
pionis, c. 6. Gerninus, a Greek philofophcr, contem-
porary with Cicero, delivers the fame doctrine, not in a
popular work, but in his Eioraywuy EnC :iPvopaEc, a trea-
tifc purely fcicntific. " WVhen we fpcak," fays he, " of
the southern temperate zone, and its inhabitants, and
concerning those who are called antipodes, it murt be al-
ways understood, that we have no certain knowledge or

X 4 information

information concerning the southern temperate zone,
whether it be inhabited or not. But fromthe spherical
figure of the earth, and the course which the fin holds
between the tropics, we conclude that there is another
zone, situated to thefouth, which enjoys the fame degree
of temperature with the northern one which we inhabit."

quo Uranologiun five Syftcmata var. Autorum. Amft.
X705. vol. iii. The opinion of Pliny the naturalist, with
refpet to both there points, was the fame: " There are
five divisions of.the earth, which are called zones. All
that portion which lies near to the two opposite poles is
oppreflfd with vehement cold, and eternal frost. There,
unblest with the aspeCt of milder stars, perpetual darkness
reigns, or at the utmost a feeble light refleCted from fur-
rounding filows. The middle of the earth, in which is
the orbit of the fun, is scorched and burnt up with flames
and fiery vapour. Between there torrid and frozen di:-
trits lie two other portions of the earth, which are tem-
perate; but, on account of the burning region interposed,
theie can be no communication between them. Thus
hceaven has deprived us of three parts of the earth." Lib.
ii. c. 68. Strabo delivers his opinion to the fame effeEt,
in terms no hl:s explicit: " The portion of the earth
which lies near the equator, in the torrid zone, is ren-
dered uninhabitable by heat." Lib. ii. p. i54. To
these I might add the authority of many other reflpcdable
p hilofophcrs and hiltorians of antiquity.

IN order to explain the fenfi in which this doctrine was

generally recqived, we may obfcrve, that Parmenides, as
we are informed by Strabo, was the first who divided the
earlt into five zones, and he extended the limits of the
7one which he supposed to be uninhabitable on account of
heat, beyond the tropics. Aristotle, as we learn Irkc-

wilb

Wife from Strabo, fixed the boundaries of the different
zones in the fame manner as they are defined by modern
geographers. But the progress of discovery having gra-
dually demonstrated that several regions of the earth which
lay within the tropics were not only habitable, but popu-
lous and fertile, this induced later geographers to circum-
scribe the limits of the torrid zone. It is not easy to as-
certain with precision the boundaries which they allotted
to it. From a pafiage in Strabo, who, as far as I know,
is the only author of antiquity from whom we receive any
hint concerning this fubjeEt, I fliould conjecture, that
those who calculated according to the measurement of the
earth by Eratosthenes, supposed the torrid zone to com-
prehend near sixteen degrees, about eight on each fide of
the equator; whereas such as followed the computation of
Pofidonius allotted about twenty-four degrees, or some-
what more than twelve degrees on each fide of the equator
to the torrid zone. Strabo, lib. ii. p. I5r. According
to the former opinion, about two-thirds of that portion of
the earth which lies between the tropics was confidered as
habitable; according to the latter, about one half of it.
With this restriction, the doctrine of the ancients con-
cerning the torrid zone appears less absurd; and we can
conceive the reafoin 4f their asSerting this zone to be unin-
habitable, even after they had opcned a communication
with fcvcral places within the tropics. YWhen men of
science spoke of the torrid zone, they confidered it as it
was limited by the definition of geographers to sixteen, or
at the utmost to twenty-four degrees; and as they knew
almost nothing of the countries ne-rer to the equator,
they might fill suppose them to be uninihabitable. In
loose and popular dificotrfe, the name of the torrid zone
continued to be given to all that portion of the earth which
lies within the tropics. Cicero ftcins to have been unac-
quainicd with tlhofe ideas of the Ilter gi'ographers, and

(adherilng

adhering to the division of Parmenides, describes the tor-
rid zone as the largest of the five. Some of the ancients
rejected the notion concerning the intolerable heat of the
torrid zone as a popular error. This, we are told by
Plutarch, was the sentiment of Pythagoras, and we learn
from Strabo, that Eratosthenes and Polybius had adopted
the fame opinion, lib. ii. I54. Ptolemy seems to have
paid no regard to the ancient docrine and opinions con-
cerning the torrid zone.

AN infrance of this is related by Hackluyt, upon the

authority of the Portuguese historian Garcia de Re-

fende. Some Englifl merchants having resolved to open
a trade with the coast of Guinea, John II. of Portugal
dispatched ambassadors to Edward IV., in order to lay
before him the right which he had acquired by the Pope's
bull to the dominion of that country, and to request of
him to prohibit his subje&s to prosecute their intended
voyage. Edward was so much shtisficd with the exclu-
five title of the Portuguefc, that he iffecd his orders in the
terms which they desired. Hackluyt, Navigations, Voy-

' H E time of Columbus's birth may be nearly afcer-

from the firagment of a letter, addressed by him to Ferdi-
nand and Ilabella, A. D. 150o, that he had, at that time,
been engaged forty years in a sea-faring life. In another
letter, he informs them, that he went to sea at the age of
fourteen; from those facts it follows, that he was born

T HE spherical figure of the earth was known to the

ancient geographers. They invented the method,

fill in use, of computing the longitude and latitude of
different places. According to their doctrine, the equa-
tor, or imaginary line which encompasses the earth, con-
tained three hundred and sixty degrees; these they divided
into twenty-four parts, or hours, each equal to fifteen
degrees. The country of the Scres or Sinm, being the
farthest part of India known to the ancients, was sup-
posed, by Marinus Tyrius, the most eminent of the an-
cient geographers belore Ptolemy, to be fifteen hours, or
two hundred and twenty-five degrees to the east of the
firrf meridian, pafling through the Fortunate Islands.
Ptoleimei Geogr. lib. i. c. ix. If this up!pofition was
well-founded the country of the Seres, or China, was
only nine hours, or one hundred and thirty-five degrees
weft from the Fortunate or Canary Islands; and the na-
vigation, in that direction, was much fhortcr than by the

courie

course which the Portuguese were pursuing. Marco
Polo, in his travels, had described countries, particularly
the island of Cipango or Zipangri, supposed to be Japan,
considerably to the east of any part of Alia known to the
ancients. Marcus Paulus de Region. Oriental. lib. ii.
c. 7o. lib. iii. c. 2. Of course, this country, as it ex-
tended further to the east, was still nearer to the Canary
Islands. The conclusions of Columbus, though drawn
from inaccurate observations, were just. If the fuppofi-
tions of Marinus had been well founded, and if the coun-
tries, which Marco Polo visited, had been situatcd to the
east of those whose longitude Marinus had ascertained, the
proper and nearefi course to the East Indies must have
been to steer directly wefl. Herrera, dec. I. lib. i. c. 2.
A more extensive knowledge of the globe has now disco-
vered the great error of Marinus, in supposing China to
be fifteen hours, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees
east from the Canary Islands, and that even Ptolemy was
mistaken, when he reduced the longitude of China to
twelve hours, or one hundred and eighty degrees. The
longitude of the western frontier of that vast empire is
seven hours, or one hundred and fifteen degrees from the
meridian of the Canary Islands. But Columbus followed
the light which his age afforded, and relied upon the
authoiity of writers, who were, at that time, regarded
as the inftrucors and guides of mankind in the fciencc of
geography.

NOTE XIII. p. o16.
A S the Portuguese, in making their dilcovcrics, did

not depart far from the coast of Afriica, they con-

cluded that birds, whose flight they obfcrvcd with great
attention, did not venture to any considerable diflancc
from land. Il the infancy of navigation, it was not

known,

known, that birds often firetch their flight to an immense
distance from any shore. In failing towards the Weft-
Indian islands, birds are often seen at the distance of two
hundred leagues from the nearest coast. Sloan's Nat.

sea, when the ship was fix hundred leagues distant from
land. Nat. Hilt. of Carolina, pref. p. 7. Hist. Natu-
relle de M. Buffon, tom. xvi. p. 32. From which it
appears, that this indication of land, on which Columbus
seems to have relied with some confidence, was extremely
uncertain. This observation is confirmed by Captain
Cook, the most extensive and experienced navigator of
any age or nation. " No one yet knows (fays he) to
what distance any of the oceanic birds go to tea; for my
own part, I do not believe that there is one in the whole
tribe that can be relied on in pointing out the vicinity of
land." Voyage towards the South Pole, vol. i. p. 275.

IN a letter of the admiral's to Ferdinand and Isabella,

he describes one of the harbours in Cuba, with all the

enthusiastic admiration of a discoverer.-" I difcovcrcd
a river which a galley might easily enter; the beauty of
it induced me to found, and I found from five to eight
fathoms of water. Having proceeded a considerable way
up the river, every thing invited me to fettle there. The
beauty of the river, the clearncfs of the water, through
which I could fee the sandy bottom, the multitude of
palm-trees of different kinds, the tallest and fincft I had
seen, and an infinite number of other large and flourishing
trees, the birds, and the verdure of the plains, are so
wonderfully beautiful, that this country excels all others
as far as the day furpanes the night in brightness and
fplcndour, of that I often said, that it would be in vain

for

for me to attempt to give your higbnefres a full account
of it, for neither my tongue nor my pen could come up
to the truth; and indeed I am so much amazed at the
fight of such beauty, that I know not how to describe it."
Life of Columbus, c. 30.

NOTE XV. p. 124.
T HE account which Columbus gives of the humanity

and orderly behaviour of the natives on this occasion

is very striking. " The king (fays he, in a letter to
Ferdinand and Isabella) having been informed of our
misfortune, expressed great grief for our loss, and im-
mediately sent aboard all the people in the place in many
large canoes; we soon unloaded the fliip of every thing
that was upon deck, as the king gave us great assistance:
he himself, with his brothers and relations, took all pof-
fible care that every thing should be properly done both
aboard and on shore. And, from time to time, he sent
some of his relations weeping, to beg of me not to be de-
jeced, for he would give me all that he had. I can assure
your highnesses, that so much care would not have been
taken in securing our efftels in any part of Spain, as all
our property was put together in one place near his pa-
lace, until the houfcs which he wanted to prepare for the
cuflody of it, were emptied. He immediately placed :
guard of armed men, who watched during the whole
inight, and those on lfore lamented as if they had been
much intcrceted in our lots. The people are fb affection-
ate, so tractable, and so peaceable, that I vwear to your
highnefles, that there is not a better race of men, nor a
better country in the world. They love their neighbour
as themselves; their convcrfation is the Ifwceteft and
mildefs in the world, cheerful, and always accompanied
with a smile. And although it is true that they go naked,

yet

yet your highnefles may be allured that they have many
very commendable customs; the king is served with great
state, and his behaviour is so decent, that it is pleasant to
fee him, as it is likewise to observe the wonderful me-
mory which these people have, and their desire of know-
ing every thing, which leads them to inquire into its
causes and effects." Life of Columbus, c. 32. It is
probable that the Spaniards were indebted for this officious
attention, to the opinion which the Indians entertained
of them as a superior order of beings.

NOTE XVI. p. 13r.
E VERY monument of such a man as Columbus is

valuable. A letter which he wrote to Ferdinand and

Isabella, describing what passed on this occasion, exhibits
a most firiking picture of his intrepidity, his humanity,
his prudencc, his public spirit, and courtly add:efs. " I
would have been less concerned for this misfortune, had I
alone been in danger, both because my life is a debt that
I owe to the Supreme Creator, and because I have at
other times been exposed to the most imminent hazard.
But what gave me infinite grief and vexation was, that
after it had pclafid our Lord to give nc faith to undertake
this enterprize, in which I had now been so fucccfsful,
that mIy opponents would have been convinced, and the
glory of your lhighiicfli's and the extent of your territory
increased by nmc; it flhould please ithe Divine Majefly to
flop all by my death. All this would have been Imore to-
lerable, had it not been attended with the lo's of thoie
meni whomn I had carried with me, upon prornire of the
greatest profpcrity, who sccing thelnlclves in such diflrefs,
cursed not only their coinilng along with Iie, but that
fear and awe of me, which prevented them from return-
ing as they often had rcellved to have done. BJut beside

all

all this, my sorrow was greatly increased, by recollecting
that I had left my two sons at school at Cordova, destitute
of friends, in a foreign country, when it could not in all
probability be known that I had done such services as
might induce your highnesses to remember them. And
though 1 comforted myself with the faith that our Lord
would not permit that, which tended so much to the glory
of his church, and which I had brought about with so
much trouble, to remain imperfect, yet I confidered that,
on account of my fins, it was his will to deprive me of
that glory, which I might have attained in this world.
While in this confused state, I thought on the good for-
tune which accompanies your highnesses, and imagined,
that although I should perish, and the vessel be loft, it
was poflible that you might somehow come to the know-
ledge of my voyage, and the success with which it was
attended. For that reason I wrote upon parchment with
the brevity which the situation required, that I had dif-
covered the lands which I promised, in how many days I
had done it, and what course I had followed. I men-
tioned the goodness of the country, the character of the
inhabitants, and that your highnefles fubjels were left in
possession of all that I had discovered. Having fealed this
writing, I addrefled it to your highnefics, and promised
a thousand ducats to any person who should deliver it
fealed, so that if any foreigners found it, the promised re-
ward might prevail on them not to give the information to
another. I then caused a great ca(k to be brought to me,
and wrapping up the parchment in an oiled cloth, and
afterwards in a cake of wax, I put it into the calk, and
having Itopt it well, I caf- it into the sea. All the men
believed that it was some at of devotion. Imagining
that this might never chance to be taken up; as the ihips
approached nearer to Spain, I made another packet like

the

the firfc, and placed it at the topos the poop, so that if the
(hip funk, the calk remaining above water might be com-
mitted to the guidance of fortune."

NOTE XVII. p. 136.
S 0 M E Spanish authors, with the meanness of national

jealousy, have endeavoured to detrat from the glory

of Columbus, by insinuating that he was led to the dif-
covery of the New World, not by his own inventive or
cntcrprifing genius, but by information which he had re-
ceived. According to their account, a veiTel having been
driven from its course by cafterly winds, was carried be-
fore them far to the welt, and landed on the coast of an
unknown country, from which it returned with diffi-
cult); the pilot, and three sailors, being the only persons
who survived the distresses which the crew suffered, from
want of provisions, and fatigue in this long voyage. In
a few day;s after their arrival, all the four died; but the
pilot having been received into the houlf of Columbus,
his intimate friend, difclofid to him, before his death, the
secret of the discovery which he had accidentally made,
and left him llis papers containing a journal of the voyage,
which cfrved as a guide to Columbus in his undertaking.

was made is no lcfs uncertain. Monfon's Nav. Trats.
Churchill, iii, 37x. No mention is made of this pilot,
or his discoveries, by And. Bernaldes, or Pet. Martyr,
the contemporaries of Columbus. Herrera, with his
usual judgment, pafles over it in silence. Oviedo takes
notice of this report, but confiders it as a tale fit only to
amuse the vulgar. Hillr. lib. ii. c. 2. As Columbus
held his course direftly weft from the Canaries, and never
varied it, some later authors have supposed, that this uni-
formity is a proof of his being guided by some previous
information. But they do not recollet the principles on
which he founded all his hopes of success, that by holding
a westerly course he must certainly arrive at those regions
of the east described by the ancients. His firm belief of
his own system led him to take that course, and to pursue
it without deviation.

'TFE Spaniards arc not the only people who have called

in question Columbus's claim to the honour of having
discovered America. Sonce German authors ascribe this
honour to Martin Behaim, their countryman. He was
of the noble family of the Bchaims of Schwartzbach, ci-
tizens of the first rank in the Imperial town of Nurem-
berg. Having tludied under the celebrated John Muller,
better knowvn by the name of Regiimnontanus, lie acquir-
ed fiich knowledge of cofniogiraphy, as prompted him to
explore those rcgions, the situation anld qualities of which
he had been accultomled to invlstigate and dcfcribc.
Under the patron,,ge of the Duiichef- of Burgundy he re-
paired to Lisbon, whither the f11me of the Portuguef di -
covcrics invited all the ad(venturous fIjrilts of the agec.

raised him; in conjuncfion with Diego Cano, to the
command of a squadron fitted out for discovery in the
year r483. In that voyage, he is said to have discovered
the kingdom of Congo. He fettled in the island of Fayal,
one of the Azores, and was a particular fiiend of Colum-
bus. Herrera, dec. i. lib. i. c. 2. Magellin had a
terreltrial globe made by Behaim, on which he demon-
firated the course that he purposed to hold in fcarch of the
commuJnication with the South Sea, which he afterwards
discovered. Gomara Hifl. c. 19, Hecrrcra, dcc. 11.
lib. ii. c. ig. In the year 493, Beh.iain visited his re-
lations in Nuremberg, and left with them a map drawn
with his ovn hand, which is still preserved among the ar-
chives of the family. Thus far the fiory of Martin Bc-
haim fecmrs to be well authenticated ; hut the account of
his having dil'cover-ed any part of the New World appears
to be merely conjctural.

IN the fir/t ediititon, as I had at that time hardly any

knowledge of Behaim but what I derived from a frivolous

he gives the name of St. Brandon. This, it is imagined,
may be tome part of Guiana, supposed at first to be an
island. He places it in the fame hltitude with the Cape
Verd Isles, and I fufpeEt it to be an imaginary island
which has been admitted into some ancient maps on no
better authority than the legend of the Irish St. Brandon
or Brendan, whose flory is so childishly fabulous as to be
unworthy of any notice. Girald. Cambricnfis ap. Mii-
fingham Florilegium Sanctorum, p. 427.

THE pretensions of the WAelfl to the discovery of Ame-

rica seem not to reft on a foundation much more solid.
In the twelfth century, according to Powcll, a diliutc
having arisen among the Ions of Owen Guyncth, king ot
North-Wales, concerning the fucceflion to his crown,
Madoc, one of their number, weary of this contention,
betook himself to sea in quest of a more quiet fettleminct.
He fleered due weft, leaving Ireland to the north, and
arrived in an unknown country, which appeared to him
so desirable, that he returned to Wales, and carried thi-
ther several of his adherents and companions. This is
said to have happened about the year 117o0, and after that,
he and his colony were heard of no more. But it is to
be obfcrved, that Powell, on whole testimony the authcn-
ticity of this flory rcfts, published his history above four
centuries from the date of the event which he relates.
Among a people as rude and as illiterate as the Veclfh at
that period, the memor) of a tranlflatiio to remote mult
have been very imperfecqly prlcfrved, and would require
to be confirmed by some author of greatcr credit, and
nearer to the .era of /Madoc's voyage, than Powell. Later
antiquaries have indeed appealed to the tefliimony of Mc-
redeth ap Rhees, a WVclfh bard, who died A. 1). 1477.
But he too lived at such a distance of time from tlhe event,
that he cannot be confidered as a witness of much nmore

credit

credit than Powell. Besides, his verses publilhed by
Hakluyt, vol. iii. p. i. convey nio information, but that
Madoc, dissatisficd with his domerfic situation, employed
himself in searching the ocean for new poflflions. But
even if we admit thr authenticity of Powell's ftury, it does
not follow that the unknown country which Madoc dif-
covered by ftcering wecf, in such a course as to leave rre-
land to the north, wns any part of America. The skill
of the Wclfh in the twelfth century was hardly equal to
fich a voyage. If he made any difcovcrv at all, it is
more probable that it was Madeira, or sone other of the
wefrern iflcs. The affinity of the Welsh language with
some dialeRs spoken in America, has been mentioned as
a circumfiance which confirms the truth of Madoc's voy-
age. But that has been observed in so few infrances, and
in rome of there the affinity is so obfcurc, or of fanciful,
that no conclusion can be drawn from the catilal recem-
blance of a fnall number of words. There is a bird,
which, as far as is yet known, is found only on the coafis
of South America, from Port Desire to the Str;iits of
Magellan. It is diflinguiflhd by the name of P,,guin.
This word in the Welsh lang uage signifies 'I/it, bhiad.
Almoff all the authors who favour the prectnlliis of
the WelflI to the diltovery of America, mention this as
an irrefragabl' proof of the affinity of the WVclih lan-
guage with that lioken in this region of America. I:ut
Mr. Penllant, who has givcen a Icicnti'ic dftc;ription of

they were discovercd about three hundred years posterior
to their migration; a period so short, that, in the course
of it, we cannot well fuippofe that all European ideas and
arts would be totally forgotten. Lord Lyttelton, in his
notes to the fifth book of his History of HIenry II. p. 37 1.
has examined what Powell relates concerningJ the dilco-
veries made by Madocs and invalidates the truth of his
ltory by other arguments of great weight.

THE pretensions of the Norwegians to the difcoveryof

America, seem to be better founded than those of the
Germans or Welsh. The inhabitants of Scandinavia
were remarkable in the middle ages for the boldness and
extent of their maritime excursions. In 874, the Nor-
wegians discovered, and planted a colony in Iceland. In
982, they discovercd Greenland, and eftabliflced fettle-
ments there. From that, some of their navigators pro-
ceeded towards the weft, and discovered a country more
inviting than thole horrid regions with which they were
acquainted. According to their rcprefcntation, this
country was sandy on the coafls, but in the interior parts
level and covered with wood, on which account they gave
it the name of Hellec-lanl, and Mrk-laul, and having
afterwards found some plants of the vine which bore
grapes, they called it JaJn. land. 'The credit of this flory
refts, as far as I know, on the authority of the saga, or
chronicle of kingt Olaus, compoeed by Snorro Stuirlonicls,
or Sturlif'ns, publiflied by e'crinfkiold at Stockholin
A. D. 1697. Snorro was boron in the year I 19 , his
chronicle i' iht be compiled aborut two celiturics after the
event wvhich lie relates. His account of the n;iviv.ltion

count of the length of the days and nights, it must have
been as far north as the fifty-eighth degree of latitude, oil
some part of the coast of Labradore, approaching near to
the entry of Hudson's Straits. Grapes, certainly, are
not the production of that country. Torfeus supposes
that there is an error in the text, by recifying of which,
the place where the Norwegians landed may be supposed
to be situated in latitude 49°. But neither is that the
region of the vine in America. From perusing Snorro's
tale, I should think that the situation of Ncwfoundland
corresponds best with that of the country lifcovered by
the Norwegians. Grapes, however, are not the pro-
duction of that barren illand. Other conjestures are
mentioned by M. Mallet, Introd. i l'Hift. de Dannem.
175, &c. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the lite-
rature of the north, to examine them. It seems manifest,
that if the Norwegians did discover any part of America
at that period, their attempts to plant colonies proved
unsuccessful, and all knowledge of it was soon loft.

SO firmly were men of science, in that age, persuaded

that the countries which Columbus had discovered

were connected with the East Indies, that Bernaldes, the
Cura dc los Palacios, who seems to have been no inconfi-
derable proficient in the knowledge of cosmography, con-
tends that Cuba was not an island, but a part of the con-
tinent, and united to the dominions of the Great Khan.
This he delivered as his opinion to Columbus himself,
who was his guest for some time on his return from his
second voyage; and he supports it by several arguments,
mostly founded on the authority of Sir John Mandcville.
MS. penes me. Antonio Gallo, who was secretary to the
magistracy of Genoa towards the close of the fifteenth
century, publiffed a short account of the navigations and
discoveries of his countryman Columbus, annexed to his
Opufcula Hiflorica de rebus populi Gcnuenfis; in which
he informs us, from letters of Columbus which he him-
self had seen, that it was his opinion, founded upon nau-
tical observations, that one of the islands lie had disco-
vered was diflant only two hours or thirty degrees from
Cattigara, which, in the charts of the geographers of
that age, was laid down, upon the authority of Ptolemy,
lib. vii. c. 3. as the most caftcrly place in Asia. From

this

this he concluded, that if some unknown continent did-
not obltrua the navigation, there must be a short and
easy access, by holding a weffterly course, to this extreme
region of the East. Muratari Scriptores Rer. Italicarum,
vol. xxiii. p. 304.

NOTE XX. p. 158.
BERNALDES, the Cura or Rector de los Palacios, a

contemporary writer, fays, that five hundred of these

captives were sent to Spain, and fold publicly in Seville
as slaves; but that, by the change of climate, and their
inability to bear the fatigue of labour, they all died in a
short time. MS. penes me.

NOTE XXI. p. 172.
COLUMBUS seems to have formed forne very singular

opinions concerning the countries which he had now

discovered. The violent swell and agitation of the wa-
ters on the coast of Trinidad led him to conclude this to
be the highest part of the terraqueous globe, and he ima-
gined that various circumffances concurred in proving
that the sea was here visibly elevated. Having adopted
this erroneous principle, the apparent beauty of the coun-
try induced him to fall in with a notion of Sir John Man-
deville, c. 10o2. that the tcrreftrial paradise was the
highest land in the earth; and he believed that he had
been so fortunate as to discover this happy abode. Nor
ought we to think it strange that a person of so much fa-
gacity should be influenced by the opinion or reports of
such a fabulous author as Mandeville. Columbus and
the other difcovcrcrs were obliged to follow such guides
as they could find; and it appears from several pafllgcs
in the manuscript of Aildr. Bernaldcs, the friend of Co-

lumbus,

lumbus, that no inconsiderable degree of credit was given
to the teflimony of Mandeville in that age. Bernalde$
frequently quotes him, and always with refpe&.

NOTE XXII. p. i85.

T is remarkable, that neither Gomara nor Oviedo, the
mofi ancient Spanish hiflorians of America, nor Her-

rera, confider Ojeda, or his companion Vespucci, as the
firtf discoverers of the continent of America. They uni-
formly ascribe this honour to Columbus. Some have sup-
posed that national rcfentment against Vespucci, for de-
serting the service of Spain, and entering into that of
Portugal, may have prompted there writers to conceal the
ations which he performed. But Martyr and Benzoni,
both Italians, could not be warped by the fame prejudice.
Martyr was a contemporary author; he resided in the
court of Spain, and had the best opportunity to be exactly
informed with respect to all public tranfations; and yet,
neither in his Decads, the first general history published
of the New World, nor in his Epistles, which contain
an account of all the remarkable events of his time, does
he ascribe to Vespucci the honour of having first disco-
vered the continent. Benzoni went as an adventurer to
America in the year 1541, and resided there a confider-
able time. He alpears to have been animated with a
warm zeal for the honour of Italy, his native country,
and yet does not mention the exploits and difcovcries of
Vespucci. Herrera, who compiled his general hiflory of
America from the most authentic records, not only fol-
lows those early writers, but accuses Vcliucci of falllfy-
ing the dates of both the voyages which he made to the
New 'World, and of confounding the one with the othler,
in order that he might arrogate to hlimlflf the glory of
having difcovcred the continent. Herrera, dec. i. lib.

iv,

iv. c. 2. He aflerts, that in a judicial inquiry into this
matter by the royal fiscal, it was proved by the testimony
of Ojeda hinmfelf, that he-touched at Hispaniola when re-
turning to Spain from his firl voyage; whereas Vespucci
gave out that they returned directly to Cadiz from the
coast of Paria, and touched at Hispaniola only in their fe-
cond voyage; and that he had finished the voyage in five
months; whereas, according to Vespucci's account, he
had employcd seventeen months in performing it. Viag-
gio primo de Am. Vespucci, p. 36. Viag. fecundo,
p. 45. Herrera gives a more full account of this iiic(tiue
in another part of his book, and to the fame effec.
Herrera, dec. i. lib. vii. c. 5. Columbus was in His-
paniola when Ojeda arrived there, and had by that time
come to an agreement with Roldan, who opposed Ojcda's
attempt to excite a new inii!brrcjtion, and, of confe-
quence, his voyage muff have been poferior to that of
the admiral. Life of Columbus, c. 84. According to
Vefipucci's account hle fct out on his firfl voyage, May Io,

in the court of Spain preparing for his voyage, and fcems
to have enjoyed a considerable degree of favour. T he as-
fairs of rte New World were at this juncture under the
dirction of Antonio Torres, a friend of Columbus. It
js not probable, that at that period a conlmiflion would
be granted to another person, to anticip:lte the admniral,
by undertakiin a voyage which lie hincfelf inten;ded to
perform. Flonflca, who patronized Ojceda, and granted
the licence for his voyage, was not recalled to court, :nd

written with little judgment, and less candour. He con-
tends for his countryman's title to the discovery of the
continent with all the blind zeal of national partiality,
but produces no new evidence to support it. We learn
from him, that Vespucci's account of his voyage was
published as early as the year 1510, and probably Iboner.

T H E form employed on this occasion served as a no-

del to the Spaniards in all their fubfcquent conqucffs

in America. It is so extraordinary in its nature, and
gives us such an idea of the proceedings of the Spaniards,
and the principles upon which they founded their right to
the extensive dominions which they acquired in the New
World, that it well merits the attention of the reader.
" I Alonfo de Ojeda, servant of the moss high and power-
ful kings of Castile and Leon, the conquerors of bar-
barous nations, their neffenger and captain, notify to you
and declare, in as ample form as I am capable, that God
our Lord, who is one and eternal, created the heaven and
the earth, and one man and one woman, of whom you
and we, and all the men who have been or ihall be in the
world, are descended. But as it has come to pals,
through the number of generations during more than five
thousand years, that they have been difpcrfed into differ-
ent parts of the world, and are divided into various king-
dons and provinces, because one country was not able to
contain them, nor could they have found in one the
means of fiubtitence and preservation; therefore God our
Lord gave the charge of all thofb people to one nman,
named St. Peter, whom he conftilutcd the lord and head

3 'f

of all the human race, that all men, in whatever place
they are born, or in whatever faith or place they are edu-
cated, might yield obedience unto him. He hath sub-
jeeled the whole world to his jurifdition, and command-
ed him to establish his residence in Rome, as the moss
proper place for the government of the world. He like-
wife promised and gave him power to eftablifi his au-
thority in every other part of the world, and to judge
and govern all Christians, Moors, Jews, Gentiles, and
all other people, of whatever fcr or faith they may be.
To him is given the name of Pope, which signifies ad-
mirable, great father and guardian, because he is the
father and governor of all men. Those who lived in
the time of this holy father obeyed and acknowledged him
as their lord and king, and the superior of the universe.
The fame has been observed with respect to them who,
since his time, have been chosen to the pontificate.
Thus it now continues, and will continue to the end of
the world.

" ONS of these pontiffs, as lord of the world, hath

made a grant of there islands, and of the Ticrre Firmsi
of the ocean fca, to the Catholic kings of Caflile, Donr
Ferdiniand and ])onna Ifiliella, of glorious memory, and
their fucceflors, our fovcreigns, with all they contain, as
is more f'ully cxpreflcd in certain deeds paflied upon that
occafioii, which you may fee, if you desire it. Thus his
majelly is kin;:.; and lord of thcfc iflmilds, and of the con-
tinetl, il virtue of this donation ; and, as king and lord
aforlfaid, mIill} of' the islands to which his title has been
Iiotilied, have rccogniz.ed his Imn;cflyv, and now yield
obedlince anld liilbjclioii to him as their lord, voluntarily
and without ri(llauce ; anil inflantl',', as io)oni as they re-
ceive(l iniloirmnition, they obeyed the rcli;ious micIli flent
by the king to lpreach to them, and to iiutiuLl tihemi ii

our

our holy faith; and all these, of their own free-will,
Without any recompence or gratuity, became Christians,
and continue to be so and his majesty having received
them graciously under his protection, has commanded
that they should be treated in the fame manner as his
other fubjecs and vassals. You are bound and obliged
to at in the fame manner. Therefore I now entreat
and require you to confider attentively what I have de-
clared to you ; and that you may more perfectly com-
prehend itj that you take such time as is reasonable, in
order that you may acknowledge the Church as the fu-
perior and guide of the universe, and likewili the holy
father called the Pope, in his own right, and his m:ljcfly
by his appointment, as king and fovcreign lord of thele
ifands, and of the Tierra Firmn 3 and that you consent
that the foresaid holy fathers shall dcc!:re and preach to
you the doctrines above mentioned. If you do this, you
a-t well, and perform that to which you are bound and
obliged ; and his majefly, and I in his name, will re-
ceive you with love and k idnefs, and will leave you,
