The Pop'e's fcihem~es against the Einperor.

HI~L~E Charles laboured, with such nh-

wearied induffry, to ·overc~ome the o~bfinacy
of the Protes~tants, the effefts of his fbeadinefs
in the executicix of his plan were rendered less
confideraible by .his rupture with the Pope,
w~hich daily~ increased. The firm reso~lution
which the Emperor f~eemned to have taken against
restor~ing Placentia;, together with his repeated
encroach'ments on the ecclefia'ftical juarif~difion ,
not only by· the regulations containedd in the
-Interim, btit by hiis~ ttem~pt to re-affremble a,
t-ouncil at Trent, exrafperated~ Paul to ~the ut-
most, who, with the weakniefs incident to~ old
age, grew more attached to his famnilyr, and

in years. Pushed ohl by there pafflons i he made
new efforts to draw the French King into an al-
liance aganint the Emrrperoi* 5 a) but fliiding that
Monarch notwiithftanding his hereditar~y enmity
to Charle~s, and dread of his growirng powet,
as unwilling as formerlyr to involve himself in
immediate hoffilities, he was obliged to con-
tradt his views, and to think of preventing· fu-
ture encroachments i since; it was niot in his
power to inflia vrengeance on account of thd~ie
wvhich were past. For this purpos~e, he deter-
inined to recal his grant of Parth~a and Placentia,
and after declating them to be reainnlexed to the
Holy See, to indemn~ify his grandson O~tavio
by a new establishment in the ecclesiastical fcate.
By this 'expedient, he hopedi to gain two points
of no thrall consequence. He, first of all, ren-
dered his poffeilion of Parma more secure; as
the Einperor would b~e cautious of invading the
patrimony of the churchj though he might eizie
wViithout ikruple a tow~n belon~ging to the houf'e
of Farnese. In the next place, he would ac-
quire a better· chance of recovering Placentia,
as his folicitations to that efFeA might decently
be urged with gre~ater importunityj and would
infallibly be: attended with more weightj when
he was confidered-not as pleading the cause of
his own family, but as an advocate for the in-

Ihereft of the church. But while Paul was prid-
ing himself on this device, as a. happy refine-
mnent in policy, O~avio, an ambitious andi high-
spirited yroung man, who could not bear with
patieniee to be' spoiled of one half of his terri-
torie~s by the rapacioufiefs of his father-in-law,
and to be deprived of the: other by the artifices
of his grandfathdr, toojk meafuge~s ini order to
prevent the execution of a plan fatal to his in-
te~re~st. He set out secretly fifont Rome , and
having .sirs1 endeavoured to furrprize Parma ,
wihich attemnpt was fruffrated b~y the fidelity of
the governor to whom thle Pope had entrafted
the defende of the town,; he mrade overtures to
the Emperor, of renouncingr all connexion ivith
the Popej and of depending entirely on him for
his future fortune. This tinexpeiaed defeAionl
of one of the Pope's own family to an enemy
whom hfe hated , irritated , almioft to madness ,
a mind peevish with old age; and theire was no
degree of severity to which Patd mright not have
proceeded against a gErandfon whom . he re-
prorlcheid as an unnatural apofftaii But happily
for bj~~avio, death prevented his carrying into
e~xecution t~he harsh resoluti~ons wchich he had
takren with i-efpefit to him, and put an end to
hiis pout~ificate~ in th~e sixtee~nth year of his ad-
miniftra~tionj and the eighty-fecoi~nd of his age.*)

A~s this event had been lohg ex;peted2, there:

iwas an extraordinary concourse of Cardinals at

rians of the fixteesith centui~y affimrm, that th~e death of
Paul 111. was occalloned by the violent pamoins which
the behaviour of his gr~andson excited; that being: in-
foimed , while lie was .refrething himflelf in one of his
gardens nears Rome, of O~chvio's attemnpt on Parn~ia, as
well as of his negociations with the Emperot by mneans
of Gonzaga, he fainted away , continued time hours in
a swoon ,theri became feverish , and diet within three
days. This is the account given of it by Thuatius, lib. vi.
P11. Adriani 1(tor. di foLoi tenirii, lib. vii. 480. and by
Father Paul, 280. Even cardinal Pallavicini, better in-
tormed thin any writer with regard to the events wrhic a

prejudice or System , more accurate in relating them ,
agrees with their narr~itive in its chief circumffances.

no occallon to search for any extraordinary caule to ac-
otount for the death of an ocld mnan of eighty-twto. There
remains an authentic account of this event; in wLlhic'h: we
find· none of those mrarvellous circutatances of which the
hifterians are to foti'd. The cardinal of Ferrara, wUho was
entruffe~d with the affairs of France at the court of Rome;
an~d M. D'Urfe', Henry's ambassador in ordinary there ,
wrote an atccount to that Manarch of the affair of Parmna,
anid of the Pope's death. By these it appears , that Oc-
tavio's attempt. to furprize Parma ; was fiiade on the
t~wentieth of OftBober; that next day in the evening , and
isot while ·he Jjas airing himl'elf in the gardens of M~onte-
Cavpllo, the Pope received iotiteligence of what he had

'and cried to bitt~ely , thist his voice wltas heard in several
apartm~ents of the palace; that next day , however, he
was to well as to give ah audience to the cardinal of Ser-
.iraa, Andc to go through burineTsi of different kinds; that
O~avio wrote a letter to the Pope , not to cardinal Farnese
-his brother, intimaoting his res~olution of throwing himself
into the arms of the Emperor; that the Pope received this

But' as Paul~ during a long Pontificate had

rais~ed many; to the purple, and those chiefly

ly devetod to his; family, Cardinal Farnese had
the command of a powerful and united squadron

cipal legate in the council of T"rent, and truited

of his coronation with the dulal folemnities. Ibidem?, -5r.

on the sixth of November a catarrh or defluxion fell down
on the Pope's lungs, with sochi dnrgerous lymptoms, that

a thir~d .lettyf we are informled, that he died November

twen~ty days elapsed between Ottavio'j atStempt~ on Parosa,

His chara~er and Sondult.

But all the luffre of this candour. or ne-

rofity he quickly effaced by a~n a~tion most thock-
ingly indecent. According to an ancient and
eftabifhed pradtice, - every Pope upon his elec-
tion claims the privilege of beffow~ing, on whom
-he pleases, the Cardinal's hat , which falls to
be dis~posed of by his being in'vefied with the
triple crown. Julius , to the aftoniifhment of
the sacred Follege, conferred this mark of dif-
tin~tio~n,· together with ample ecclesiastical re-
venues, and the right: of bearing his name and
arms, upon one Innocent, a youth of sixteen,
born of obscure parents, and known by the
name of the Ape, from his having been trafted
with the care of an animal of that species, in

would have given offence, even in those dark
periods, wTihen the credul~ous fuper~tition of the
people emboldned .ecclefia~itiks to venture orn
the most flagrant violations of decorumn. i But: in

how difficult it was to confine ifach a.body of
snen within the narrow limits which it was the
interest of the church of Rome to preferibe; and

den inquiries, as well as dangrerous d~ecisions.
H~e wtithed , for ther'e reasons, to have eluded
the obligati-on of hiis oath, and ga~ve an amibi-
guious answer· to the firRi proprafals which were
made to him by the Emlperor, with r~egard to
that matter. But Charles, either from his na-.
tural obffiinacy in aIdhering to the measures
which he: had once a~dopted , or f~rom the mere
pride of acc~omplithing what w;as held to be al-
most impofirble, persisted obstinately in his re-
solution of forcing the Pr~oteftannts to return inlto
the besom of the ch~urch. Having perfaladed
himself~, that thEe authoritative decisions of the.
council might be employed with efficacy: in com-
bating; their preju~dices, he, in consequence of
that perfuda~ion , continued to solicit earnestly
that a newv bull of convocation might be ill'ued;
and the Pope could not, -ivithi decency, reje~t
that requefit, When Julius found that he could
not prevent the carlling of a council, he endea-
voured to take all the merit of having procured
the meeting of an assembly, which was the ob-
je&t of fach general defiire and expe~tatilon. A
congregation of Ca~rdinals, to wvhom hie referred
the consideration of. what wias necessary for r'e-
floring peace to the church, recommended, by
his dire~tion, the speedy coanvocahtion of a conn.i
cil, as the most effe~iual expedient for that: pur-
pose; and' as thre new herefies raged wTith the
g~reatest violence in Germany, they proposed

Trent as the placbe of its meeting , that, by a
near infpeC~ion of thee evil, ·the remedy might
be applied w~ith greater -diikernment and cer-
tainty of furccefs. The Pope wa~rmly: approved
of this advice, which he hims~elf ha~d di~tated,
and sent nuncios to the Imperial and Fren~ch
cour~ts , in order. to make know4 his. in ten-

A .dict.at Augsburg to enlforce the Interim.

About this time, the Emperor had summ-on-

ed a new diet to meet at Augsburg, in order
to enforce the observation of the~Interim, and
to procure a more authentick a&t of the Empire,
acknowledging the jurifdi~tion of the council,
as well as an explicit promise~ of conforming to
its decrees. He appeared there (June a5. 1550.)
in person, -together with his son the Prince of
Spain. Few -of the Eledoars were present, but
all sent deputies in their name. Charles, not-
withstanding the defpotick authority with which
he had given law in the Empire during two
years , knew that the spirit of' independence
among the Germans was not entirely subdued,
and for that reason took care to over - awe the
diet by ·a considerable body of Spanith troops
which es~corted him thither.· The first point
submitted to the consideration of the diet, was
the neceiflity of holding- a council. All the

Popith members agreed , without di~fficulty ,
that the meeting of that assembly thould be re-
mewed at Tirent, and promiifed ann implicit ac-
guiercence in its decrees. T~he Protestants, in-
timidated and disunited , must have followed
.their example , and the: refohition of the diet
would have proved unanimous, if Mlaurice of
Saxony had not begun at_ this timne to disclose
new intentions, and to aft: a part very different
from that which he had to, long afru~med.

~Maurice begiss to for~m designs agailinR I(he Emperor.
By an artful dilirmulation of his own senti,

ments; by address in paying· court to the Em-
peror; and by the seeming zeal with which he
forwarded all his ambitious fohemes, IMaurice
had raise~d himself to the Ele~toral dignity; and
hiaving added the dominions of the elder branch
of the Saxon family to his own, he was become
the most powerful Prince in Germany. But his
long and intimate union with the Emperor, had
afforded him. many opportunities of observing
narrowly the dangerous tendencyT of his fche-
mes. He saw the yokre that was preparing for.
his country ; and from the rapid as well as
formidable progress of the ·Imperial power, was
convinced that but a few fleps more remained
to be taken, in order to render Charles as ab-
solute a Monarch in Germany as he had become
i3n Spain. The more eminent the condition was
t~o which he himself had been exalte'd, the more

solicitous did he naturally become to maintala
all its rights and privileges, and the more did
he dread the thoughts of descending from the:
rank of a Prince almost independent,? to that of
a vassal fubje&t to the will of a makler. At the
fame time, he perceived that Charles was bent
on exa~ting a rigid conformity to the do~trines
and rites of the Romith chur~ch, initead of al-
lowing liberty of conscience , the promise of
which had allured f~everral Protestant Pripces to
aift him in the war against the confederates of
Smalkalde. As he hims~elf, notwithffanding all
the compliances which he had made: from nos
tives of interest, or anl excess of confidence in
the Emnperor , was sincerely attached to the
Lutheran tenets , he determined not to be a
tame fpeaator of the overthrow of a ijyftem
which he believed to be founded in truth.

The political motives which influenced him.

This resolution , flowing from the love of

liberty, or zeal for religion , was fleengthen~ed
by political and interefied cornfiderations. In
that: elevatedl flation , in which M~attrice was
now placed, new and more extenilve profpe~s
opened to his view. His rank and power en-
titled him to be the head of the Proteftents in
the Empire.* His predecessor , the degra~ded
Eletor, with inferior abilities, and territories
les~s considerable, had acquired such an afcen-
dant over the councils of the party; and IMau-

rice hneither· wanted dircmernmet to fee the ad-
vantage of this pre-eminence, nor anribitioli to
aim at attaining it. But he found himself in a
situation which rendered the attempt no le~ss.
difficult, than the obje~t of it was impor~tant.
Oin the bne hand, the connexion which he had
izormed with the Emperor wias tod intimate, that
he could fecarcely hope to take ahy fiep which
tended to dissolve it: , without alairming his
jealolury , and drawihg on himself the wholke
Aveighit of that power, w-hich had cruithed the
gre~atest confederacy ever formed in Germany.
On the oither ha~nd , the balamities which he
had brolight on the Protestant party were to
recerit, as wdl as grea~t, that it seemed almoff
impollible to regain their confideh~ce, or to rally
and reanimiat~e a body of men, after himself had
been the ;chief infitrument in breaiking their
union and vigoxir. There confidierations were
fu~fficient to have dilfcouxraged any person of a
spirit less aciventurbus than Mlani-ice's. But to
him the grazideur and vaftnersi of the enlterprize
wei-e allureinents; and he boldly res~olved- on
measures, the idea of which a gehius of an in-
ferior· order could not haive ·coixceived, or would
have tre'mbied at the thoughts of the danger
that attended the eatectition of th~~em.

Tihe pafflons whic~h cooperated W~ith thefCe.

His prflnotus concur~red with his interest in

confirming this irefolution; and the res~entment

bicited by an injury, which he fenlfibly felt,
added newv force to the motives for

, oppoling

the Emperor , which fo~und polidy f~uggefed.

For this pui~pofe , he had assembled the

Makes profemons of zeal for the Protestant religion.
By this dextrous condua, the introduaion

of the Interim excited none of those violent con-
vulfions in Sa xony which it occasioned in other
provinces. But though the Saxons s~ubmitted,
the more zealous Lutherans exclaimed againit
Mlelan~thon and his associates, as false brethren,
who were either to wicked as to apostatize from
the truth altogether; or so artful, as to betray it
by subtle diftinalions; or fCo feeble-fpirited as ·to
give it up from pusillanimity and crimnal com-
plailance to a prince, capable of sacrificing to
his political interest that which he himself re-
garded as most sacred. Maurice, being con-
f~cious what a colour of probability his past con.
duat gave to those accusations, as well as
afraid of losing entirely the confidence of the Pro.

r tefiants, issued a' declaration containing profef-

firons of his zealous attachment to the Reformed
religion, and of his resolution to guard against
all the errors or encroachments of the Papal

perfxfted in reje~ting the Interim, he undertook
to reduce it to obedience, and infkantly s~et
about levying troops to be employed in that
service. This damped all the. hopes wh-ich the
Pro~testants begun to conceive of MVaurice, in
consequence of his declaration, and left them
more than ever at a loss to guess at his real
intentions. Their former. fiufpicion and diffruit
of him revived, and the divines of Magrdeburg
filled Germany with writings in which they re-
presented him as the most formidable enemy of
the Proteitant religion, who treacherously as-
famed an appearance of zeal for its interest, that
he might more eff'edually execute his schemes
for its deffrtraion.

Protests against the mode of proceeding in the council.

This charge,. supported by the evidence of

recent fadts, as well as by his pres~ent ddbious
condluR, gained fach universal credit, that
Mfaurice was obliged to take a vigorous fiep in
his· own vindication. As soon as the ree as-
fembling of the council at Trent was proposed in
the diet, his ambass~adors pr~oteffep that: their
master would not acknowledge its authority, un-
less all the points which had been already de-
cided there, were reviewed and cons~idered as
entire; unless the Protestant divines had a full

hearing granted them, and wverie allowed a de-
chiive voice in the council; and unless the Pope
r~enounced his pretenflons to preside in the coun-
cil engaged, to fabniit to its decrees , and ab-
solve the bifhlops from their oath of obedience,
that they might deliver their f'entiments with
greater freedom. These demands, wvhich were
higher than any that the Reformers had ven-
tured to make , even when the zeal of their-
party was warmeit, or their affairs moRt proi
fperous, counterbalanced, in some degree, the
imprefilon which M~aurice's preparations against
Mlagdeburg had made upon the minds of the
Protestant~s, and kept them in f~ufpence with
regard to his deligns. At the fame time, he had
address enough to represent this part of his con-
dua~t in such a light to the Emperor, that it
gave him no offence, and occasioned no inter-
ruption of th~e firi~t confidence which farbfifted
between them. What the pretexts were which
he employed, in order to give fuzch a1 bold de-
claration an innocent appearance, the contemi
porary hifforians have not explained; I that they:
imposed upon Charles is certain , for he still
continued not only to prosecute his plan, as
well concerning the Interim as the council,
with the fame ardour, but to place the famie
confidence in Maurice, with regard to the exe;
c~ution of both.

The diet resolve to make war on the city of Magdeburg.

The Pope's resolution concerning the coun-

cil not being yet known at Augs~burg, the chief
busines~s of the diet was to enforce the obferva-
tion of the Interim. As the frenate of Malgde-
burg, notwtithftandling various endeavours to
frighten or to sooth them into compliance, not
only persevered -obstinately in their oppofiition
to the Interim, but began to firengthen the
fortifications of their city, and to levy troops
in their own defence, Charles required the diet
to af~ift him in quelling this audacious rebellion
against a decree of the Empire. Had the mem-
bers of the diet been left to a~t agreeably to
their own inclination, this demand would have
been reje~ted without hesitation. All the Germans
who favoured, in any degree, the new opi-·
nions in religion , and many who were influ-
enced by no other consideration than jealousy·
of the Emperor's growving power, regarded this
effort of the citizens of Mlagdebnrg, as a noble
fland for the liberties of their country. Even
fach as had not res~olution to exert the fame spirit,
admired· the g~allantry of their enterprize, and
withed it success. But the presence of the Spa-
nifh~ troops, together with the dread of the Em-
peror's difpleafaxre, over-awed the members of
the diet to s~uch a degree, that , without ven-,
turing to utter their own sentiments , they ta-
mely ratified, by their votes, whatever the
Emperpr was pleas~ed to pres~cribe. The rigor-

ous decrees , which Charles had if2'ued by his
own authority against the Magdeburgers, were
confirmed; a resolution was taken to raise troops
in order to besiege the city in form, and per-
sons were named to fix the contingent in men
or money to be furnished by each slate.

Appoint Maurice general.

At the fame time, the diet petitioned that

Maurice might be entruffed with the command
of that army; to which Charles gave his con-
sent with great alacrity, and with high enco-
miums upon the wifdomn of the choice which
they had made. b) As Maurice conduffed all
his fSchemes with profound and impenetrable
secrecy, it is probable that; he took no fiep
a vowedly in order to obtain this charge. Tlhe
-recommendation of his countrymen was either
purely accidental, or flowed from the opinion
generally entertained of his great abilities; anid
neither the diet had any foresight, nor the Em-
peror any dread, of the cons~equence which
followed upon this no~miziation. Ml~aurice ac-
cepted, without hesitation-, the trufcomnmitted
to him, instantly dis~cerning the important ad-
vantages which he might derive from it.

Meanwhile, Julius, in pr~eparing the bull

for the convocation of the council, observed all
those tedious forms whbich· the court of Rome
can employ; with wonderful dexterity, to retard
any disagreeable measure. ·At lath ( December
x550.) it was publifhled, and the council fam-
oroned to meet at Trent on the first day of the
enfauing month of 1Vay. As he knew that many
of the Germans rejete-d or dis~puted the authority
and jurifdi~tion which the Papal See claims with
re~p~eEt to general councils, he took care, in
the preamble of the .hull, to affect, in the
fkrongeft ,terms, his own right, not only to
call and preside int that assembly, but to dire&t
its proceedings; nor would he soften there ex-
prellions, in any degree, in compliance with
the repeated folicitations of the Emperor, who
foresaw what offence theyI would give, and
what conftru~tion might be put on them. They
were ced~iured accordingly with great fCev-erity,
by several members of the* diet; but whatever
dlifguft or fulipicion they excited, such abs~olute
dire~tion of all their deliberations had the Em-
peror acquired, that he procured ( Feb. I 7,
z55 r.) a recers, in which the authority of the;
council was recognifhed, and declared to be the
proper remedy for the evils which at that time
affiked the church; all the Princes and Rtates
of the Empire, fach- as had made innovations
in religion, as well as those who adhered to

the system . of their forefath~ers, were required
to fend their repretent~atives to the council; theii
E~mperor engaged to grant a 'fhfe - condua to
fuzch as dem-3andedI it, and td 'fecdure theni~an
imrpartial hearing in the council; he promised
to fix his refidefiice in some city of the Empire,~
in the neigrh'bouirhood of Trent', that he might
prot~ed the members of the council by his pre-
fence, and takre care that, by conduffing~ their
deliberati~ons agrreeablyr to fCcripture and the doc-
trine of the fathers, they mright ·bring them to
a desirable issue. In this reces~s, ~the ·obfCerva-
tion of ·the Interim was more Rriatly e~njoined
than ever; ·and the Emperor threatened all who
had hiitherto ·neg~le~ed or refused to conform tol
it, with the severest effe~ts of his vengeance,
if they pertified in- their disobedience. i)

Another fruitless a.t~tempt to. procure the Landgrave

liberty.

During the meeting of this diet, a new at-

tempt was made, in order to procure liberty
to the Landgrave. That Prince , nowise re-
con~ciled by time to his situation, grewV every
day more impatient of reffraint -Having; often
applied to Maurice and the Elector of Branden-
burg, who took every occasion of soliciting the
Emperor in his behalf , though without any
effeRt, he holy <'ommanded his f'ons to summon

periales, vol. ii* 34o.

them, with legal formality, to perform what
was contained in the bond which they had
granted him, by, surrendering themselves to be
treated with the fame rigour as the Emperor
had afed him.: This furnished them with a
freth pretext for renewing their application to
the Emperor, together with. an additional argue
ment to, enforce it. Charles ~firmly resolved not
to grant their request , though , at the fame
time, being extremely desirous to get rid of
their incessant importunity, he endeavoured to
prevail on -the Landgrave to give up the obli-
gation which he had received so h w
Eledfors. But that Prince refusing to part with
a ifecurity which he deemed essential to his
safety, the Emperor boldly cut the knot which
he could not untie; and by a public deed ane
nulled the bond which IVaurice and the Eledtor
of BrandenBurg haul granted , absolving them
from all their eng gements to the Landgrave.
No pretenflon to a p~ower [o pernicious to society
as that of abrogating at pleasure the most sacred
laws of b anour, an~d most formal obligations of
publick faith, had hitherto been formed by any
but the Roman Pontifs , who, in consequence
of their claim of infallibil~ity, arrogate the right
of difpenji~ng with precepts and duties of every
kind. All Germany was £11led with aftonif~he
ment, when Charles affumned thg fa~me prerome
g~ative. The Crate of fubje~tion, to which the
Empire was reduced , appeared to be more

rigorous , as well as intolerable, than that of
the most wretched and enslaved nations , if
the Emperor, by an arbitrary decree , might
cancel those solemn contrats, which are the
founndationa of that mutual con~fid~ence whereby
men are held together in social uniqu. The
Landgrave hirnfelf now gave up all hopes of
recovering his liberty by the Emperor's content,
and endeavoured to procure it by his own ad-
drd.s. But the plan which he had formed to
deceive his guards being discovered , fach of
his attendants as he had gained to favour his;
efeape, were p~ut to death , and he wats con-
fined in the citadel of M~echlin more dl~iefey
than ever, k)

Charles's plan of procuring the Imperial crowtn soir

his son Philip.

Another tranf~a~ion was carried on during

this diet, with refped to an affair more nearly:
interesting to the Emperor, and which occasion-
ed likewise a general alarm among· the Princes
of the Emlpire. Charles, though formed with
talents which fitted him for conceiving and con-
du~ting great designs, was not capable, as has
been often observe~d, of bearing extraordinary
fuuccefs. Its operation on his mind was to
violent and intoxicating , that it elevated him
beyond what was moderate or attainable, and

k) Sleid. So4. Thyan, 1. vi, s34, 735-

turned his whole a~ttentipon to the purs~uit of
vast but chimerical objeats. * Such ha~d been the
effte&t of his vi~tory over the con'federates of
Smalkalde. He did not long reft satisfied with
the fabftantial and- certain advantages which
were the refuslt of that event, but, desp~ising
there , as poor or inconsiderable fruits of farch
great faccefs , he h~ad aimed at bringing all
Germany~B to an uniformity in religion, and at
rendering the Imperi~al power deifpotick. These
were objeats extremely fpglendid , indeed-, and
alluring to an ambitious mind; the purs~uit of
themr, hiowever , was attended with manifest
danger, and the attainment of them very pre-
carious. But the iteps which he had already
taken towards them, having been accompanied
with fuxch faucce~s , his imagination , warmed
wyith contemplating this vast design, overlooked
or derpiifed all remaining difficulties. As he
conceived the execution of his plan to be cer-
tain, he began to be so~licitous how he might
render the poffeffiion~ of such an important ac-
quifition perpetual in his family , by tradf-
mitting the German Empire , as well as the
kingdoms of Spain, and his dominions in Italy
and the ]Lowc Countries, to his fonI. HIraving long
revolved this flatterinlg idea in his mind, with-
out communicatitig it, even to those miniffers
whom he moss truffed , he had called Philip
out of Spain, in hopes that his pres~ence would
facilitate the carrying forward the s~cheme.

The obltacles that Rtoad in its w~ay.

G~reat obst~acles , however , and fach as

would have deterred any ambition less accuf-
tomed to overcome difficulties , were to be
farmounted. He had, in the year one thousand
five hundred and thirty , imprudently ass~isted
in procuring his brother Ferdinand the dignity
of King of the Romans, and there was no pro-
bability that this Prince, who was still in the
prime of life, and had a son grown up to the
years of manhood, would relinquish, in favour
of his nephew, the near prof~pe&t of the Im-
perial throne, which Charles's infirmities and
declining state -of health opened to himfeklf.
This did not deter the Emperor from venturing
to make the proposition; and when Ferdinand ,
notwithflanding his profound reverence for his
brother, and oblequlous f~ubmiflion to his will
in other instances, rejeated it in a peremrptory
tone-, he was not discouraged by one repulse.
He renewed'his applications to him by his fif-'
ter, M~ary Queen of Hungary, to whom Ser-
dinand flood indebted for the cr-owns both of
Hungary and Bohemia , and who, by her great·
abilities , tempered with extreme gentleness of
difpolition, had acquired an extraordinary in-
fluence over both the brothers. She entered
wYarmly into a meas~ure, which tended to m~ani-
feftly to aggrandize the house of Auffria; and,
flatte~ringr herself that the coutld temtn ~ Fei~rdinand
to renounce the reverflonary poffefrlon of the

Imperial dignity for an immediate efAblirthment-,
the afflured him that the Emperor, ·by way of
_compens~ation. for his giving up his chance of'
fazcceffion, would initantly bestow upon him
territories of very considerable val~ue, and point.
ed out in particular those of the Duke of W~ur-
temberg, which might be confifeated upon did-
ferent pretexts. But neither by her address nor
intreaties, could the induce Ferdinand to ap-
prove of a plan, which would have degraded
hlim from the highest rankr among the.Monarchs
of Europe to that of a fabordinarte and depen-
dent: Prince. He was, at: thie f~ame time, more
attached to his children, than by a rash con-
cellion to frufkrate all the high hopes, in proE-
pedt of which they had been educated.

His endeavours. to fairmount there.

Notwithfl~anding the immovable firmness

which Ferdinand discovered, the Emperor did
not abandon his fchemne. He flattered hinsfelf
that he might attain the obje&t in view by an-
other channel, and that it: was not impofilrble
to prevail on the Eledor~s to cancel their former
choice of Ferdinand, or at least to eledt Philip
a second King of the Romnans, fabsftituting him
as next in fa~ccefflon to his uncle. W~rith this
view, he tookr Philip along with him to the
diet, that the Germans might have an oppor-
tunity to observe and become acquainted with
the Prince, in behalf of whom he courted their

interest; and he himself employed all the arts
of address or insinuation to gain the 'Elemors,
and to prepare them for lending a favourable
ear to the proposal. But: no s~ooner did he ven-
ture upon mentioning it to them, than they,
at once, saw and trembled at the cons~equences
with w~hich it would be attended. They had
long felt all the inconveniencies of having placed
at the head of the Empire a Prince whose power
and dominions were fCo. extensive; if they t'hould
now repeat the folly , and continue the Impe-
rial crowrn, like an hereditary dignity, in the
fame family, they foresa8w that they would give
the fan an opportunity of carry~ing on the fyfiem
of oppre~ffon which the father had begunn; and
would put it: in his power to overturn whatever
was yet left entire in the ancient and venerable
fabtrick of the German conrftitution.

Philip's chara~er disagreeable to the Germans.

The charafter of the Prince, in whose fa-

vour this extraordinary proposition was made,
rendered it still lef's agreeable. Philip , though
poff'effed with an insatiable desire of power, was
a firanger to all the arts of conciliating gpood-
will. Haughty, reserved, and severe, he, in-
flead of gaining new friends, difg~uffed the an-
oient and most devoted partizans of the A9uffrian
interest. He scorned to take the trouble of ac-
quiring the language of the country to the go-
vernment of which he aspired; nor would he

condescend to pay the Germians the compliment
of accommodating himself, ~during· his refidenlce
among them, to their matmrers and cuftpms. He.
allowed the Ele~tors and inoft illuffrious Princes
in Germany, to remain in his presence unco-
vered , affe~~ing a flately and dist-ant demeanour,
which the g~reatest of the G~erma~n Emperors,
and even Chazrles 7himself, amnidft the pride of
power and vi~tory, had never af~umed. 1) On
the other hand , Ferdinand, from the time of'
his arrival in Germany, had studied to render
hims~elf acceptable to the people, by a confor-
mity to their manners, which seemed to flowi
from choike; and his son M~aximilian, who was
born in Germany, poffeffe~d, in an eminent de-
gree, such amiable qualities as rendered him
the darling of his countrymen, and induced
them to look forwrard to his ele~tion as a most
desirable event. Their eft~eeim and aiflfeEtion for
him, fortified the resolution which found policy·
had suggested; and determined the Germans to
prefer the popular virtues of Ferdinand and his
son, to the stubborn aufferity of Philip , which
inltereft could not soften, nor ambition teach
him to disguise.

Charles obliged to reliquirh this ·scheme.

All the EleC~ors, the ecclefiaffical as well

as secular, concurred in expreing such firong

disapprobation of the measure, that Charles,
notwithstanding ,the r~eluc~ance with which he
gave up any point, was obliged to drop the
fchemne as impra~ticable. By his unseasonable
perseverance in pushing it , he not only filled
the Germans with new jealoury of his ambitious
deiigns, but laid the foundation ofrivalifhip and
discord in the Auffrian family, anda forced his
brother Ferdinand, in felf-defence, to court the
Ele~ors, particularly IVdaurice of Saxony, and
to form s~uch connexions with them, as cut off
all profpe& of renewing the propos~al with furc-
cers. Philip, sowered by his disappointment,
was s~ent back to Spain, to be called thence
when any new scheme of ambition thlould render
his presence neceirary. m)

tiplicity of evrents to which thetek gave rife, as
seldom allowed him to apply his whole force to
any one objeat. The machine which he had to
condua was so grerat and~ complicted, that an
unforeseen irregularity or obfkru~ion in one of~
the inferior wheels, often disconcerted the mo-
tion of the whole, and disappointed him of the
most considerable effeas which he expedted.
Such an unlooked-for occurrence happened at:
this jun~ture, and created new obstacles to the
execution of his s~chemes with regard to reli-
gion. Julius III. though he had confirmed Oc-
tavio Farnes~e in the poirffeion of the dutchy of
Parma, during the fi~rst effuiions of his joy and
gratitude on his promotion to the papal throne,
soon- began to repent of his ow~n generosity,
and to be apprehensive of consequences which
either he did not foresee, or had disregarded,
while the se~nse of his obligations to the family
of Faralefe was recent. ·The Emperor skill re-
tained Placentia in his hands, and had not re-
linquithed his pretenflons to Parma as a fief of
the Empire. Gonzaga, the governor of Milan,
having, b~y the part which he took in the mur-
de~r of the late Duke Peter Ludovico, offered
an insult to the family of Farnese , which he
knew could never be forgiven, had, for that
reason, vowed its defiru0;ion; and employed
all the influence which his great abilities, as
well as long s~ervices , gave him with the Em-
peror, in perfunading him to se~ize Parma by

so rce

force of arms. Charles, in compliance with his
folicitations, and that he might gratify his own
desire of an~nexing Parma to the M~ilanese, lif~-
tened to the propos~al; and Gronzaga, ready to
take' encouragement from the slightest asppear-
.ance of approbation, began to assemble troops.,
and to make other preparations for the execution
of his fTchemne.

O &avia Farnete courts the afiita nce of France.

O~tavio, who saw the impending danger,

found it necessary, for his own safety, to en-
crease the garrison of his capital, and to levy
soldiers for defending the reft of the country. But
as the expence of sauch an effort far exceeded his
scanty revenues, he represented his situation to
the Pope, and implored that prote~ion and as-
fiftance which was due to .him as a vass~al of
the church. The Imperial minister, however,
had already pre-occupied the Pope's ear; and
by discoursing continually concerning the danger
of giving offence to the Emperor, as well as
the imprudence of fuupporting O~avio in an ufur-
yation to detrimental to the Holy See, had
totally alienated him from the family of Parnef~e.
O~avio's remonfkrance and petition met, of con-
fCequence, with a, cold reception; and he, def-
pairing of any assistance from Julius, began to
look round for proteaion from some other quar-

letters, requiringp Oetavio to relinquit~h his new

the Duke of Mescklenburg with more resolution

slaughter. But as they' were animated with
that unconquerable spirit , which flows from
seal for religion co - operating· with the love of
civil liberty , far from being difheartened by
their misfort~une, they prepared to defend themi-
,selves with vigour. Many of the veteran fol-

diers wtho had s~erved in ·this leng. wars betwee~n
the Emperor a~nd King of France , crowding tos
their standards under able and experienced offi-.
cers, they acq~uired military skill by degrees,
and added all the advantages of that to the ·es-
forts of undaunted courage. The Duie· of
M~ecklenburg , notwithstanding the severe blow
which he had given ·the ~Magdeburgers, not dar-
ing to invest a town itrongly fortified, and d~e-
fended by such a garrifba, continued to ravage
the open country.

MYaurice takes the command of the army which carried

As the hopes of booty drew many adven-

ginning to f~uffer diffrefs from want of provisions,
and Iflaurice finding it in~xpofible to protraft
matters any longe~r withlout filling the Emperor
with fach suspicions as might have dis~concerted
all his measures., he concluded ( Novemb. 3:
x55 x.) a treaty of capitulation with the city
upon the following condfitions: That the Magde-
bur~gers thould humbly implore p~ardon of the
Emperor; that they thould not for the future
take arms , or enter into any alliance againit
the house of Atuffria; that they thnould faubmit
to the, authority of the Imperial· chamber; that
they thould conform to - the decree of the diet
at Auigfburg with refpe~t to religion; that: the
new fortificat~ions addeda to the townv thould be

demoli~thed; that they thould pay a fine of fifty
thoufTand crowns, deliver up twelve pieces of
ordnance to the Emperor, and set the Duke of
Mecklenburg , together with their other pri-
foners, at liberty, without ransom. Next day~
their garrison marched out, and Maurice took
poffefiron of the town with great military
pomp,

IVlaurice's views at this junhare.

Before the terms of capitulation were fettled,

Maurice had held many conferences with
~Albert count Malnsfeldt , who had the chief
command in Magdeburg. He consulted likewise
with count Heideck, an o~fficer who 'had served
wcith great reputation in the army of the league
of Smailkalle , whom the E~mperor had pro-
fdribed on account of his zeal for that: cause,
but whom MVaurice ha~d, notwithstanding, f~e-
cretly engaged in his s~ervice , and admitted
into the most: intimate confidence. To them
he communicated a fecheme, which he had long
revolved in his mind, for procuring libertyx to
his fkt~her-in-law the Ltandgrave, for vindicat-
ing: the privileges of the Germanick body, andl
fietting bounds to the dangerous eneroachments
of the Imperial power. Having deliberated
with them concerning the meafares which might
be necefrary for securing the fqcefs; of fetch an
arduous enterprize, he gave lMansfeldt secret
affo~rances that the fortifications of Magdebur~g

thould not be destroyed, and that the inhabi-
tants thould neither be difkurbed in the exercise
of their religion, nor be deprived of any of
their ancient immunities. In order to engage
I~isurice more thoroughly from considerations
of interest to fulfil therie engagements , the
tenate of Magdeburg ele~ted him their Bui~ggrave,
a dignity which had formerly belonged to the
ele~toral house of Saxony, and which entitled
him to a very ample jurifdiftion not only in
the city but in its dependencies, t)

'Thus the? citizens of Magdeburg, after en-

during a flege of twelve months, and firuggling
for their liberties, religious and civil, with an
invincible fortitude , worthy of the cause in
which it was exerted , had at last the good
fortune to conclude a treaty, which left them
in a better condition than the reft of their
countrymen l, whom their timidity or want of
publick spirit had betrayed into such mean fab-
miirons to the Emperor. But wxhile a great
part of Germany applauded the gallant condu&t
of the M~agdeburgers, and rejoiced in their hav-

capit~ulation were to perfealy conformable. to
those which thie Emperor had granted to the
other Protestant cities, and Maurice took fach

m~uch obstinacy, that Charles , far from f~ui-
pe~tiag any thing fraudulent or collusive in
the termns of accommt~odation , ratified them
without hesitation , and absolved the MVagde-
burgers from the: sentence of ban which had
been denouncerd against them.

The' odyq;point that norw remainedi to em-

bar rats Miaurie w~as how -to keep together the
veteran ti-oops which had served under him, as
wiell as th-ose which had been employred in the
dtefence of the town. For /this, too, he found
an expedient with fingrular art and felicity. His
schemes against the Emperor were niot yet to
fully ripeiteda' :that he durst venture -to difelofe
them, and proceed openly to carry them into
execution. The winter was approaching, which
made it impailble to take the field immnedia-
tely. He was afraid that it would give a pre-
m~ature alarm to the EImperor, if he t~hould re-
tlain foch a considerable body in his pay until
the season ·of a~tion returned- in the Ifpring. AiSs
soon then as M~agdeburg op.ened its gates, he
sen~t home his Saxon f~ubjeffs, wthom he could
c-ommand- to take arms and reaffemnble on the
thort~eft wNarring; and at the fame time, paying
part' of the arrears due to the mercenary troops,
·who· had followed his standard, as well as to
the f'oldli·r wvho had served in the garrison, he
absolved them from their refpedive oaths of
fidelity, and disbanded them. But the moment
he gav~e thiem' their d~ischarge, ·George Duke of
Mecklenb~urg, w~ho was now set at liberty, of-
fered to tak~e them into his service, and to be-
come farety for the payment of what was full
owing to them. As furch adventurers were ac-
cuffomed often to change masters, they instant.

ly accepted the offer. Thus ther~e troops were
kept united , and, ready to march wherever
M~aurice ffiould call them, while the Emperor,
deceived by this artifice', and -igtagining that
the D~uke of M~ecklenburg had: hired them with
an inrtention to aftert, his claims ito a part of his
cbrother's territories. by force of arms, fulrfered

of employing some new,artifice in order to en-
g~age his attention, and to confirm him in his
pres~ent security. As he krnew that the chief
objeft of the Emperor's solicitude at this junc-
ture, was how he might prevail with the Pro-
teftant States of Germany to recognize the au-
thority of the council of Trent, and to fend
thithner amnbaflhdors in their own name, as well
as deputies. from their refpedive churches, he

took hold of this predominating pafflori in order·
to amure an~d to deceive him. He aEfe~ted ai
wonderful zeal to gratify Charles in what he
desired with regard to this matter; he nominated
ambassadors, whom he empowered to attend
the council; he made Choice of IVelanahon' and.
some of the most eminent among his brethren
to prepare a confeflion of faith, and to lay it
before that assembly. After his example, ~and
probably in consequence of his f~olicitations, the
Duke of Wortemberg , the city of Stridburg,
and other Protefltant States appointed armbaffa-
dors and divines to attend the council. They all
applied to the Emperor for his fa8fe-condudt,
wvhich they obtained in the most ample form.
This was deemed fufficient for the security of
the ambassadors, and they proceeded according-
ly on their journey; but a fecparate f'afe-conduat
from the coulncil itself was demanded for the
Protestant divines. The fate of John- Hurs and
Jerome of Prague, whom the council. of Con-
st~ance, in the preceding century,. had con-
demned to the flames without ragarding the
Imperial f'afe - condaRt which had been granted
them, rendered this precaution prudent and ne-
ceffary. But as the Pope was no less unwilling
that the Protestants thould be admitted to an
hearing in the council, than the Emperor had
been eager in bringing· thern to demand it, the
legate by promis~es and threats prevailed on the'
fathers of the council to decline iffaing a false,

council of Basil had granted to the followers of

lists. he Proteftents, on their part, insisted

upon the council's copying the precise words
of that infirument. The Imperial ambassadors
ilnterpofed, in order to obtain what would f~atis-
fy them. . Alterations in the form of the writ
were proposed; expedients were ig~gefited;
protests and counter -protests were takren: the
legate, together with his associates, labouxred
to gain their point by artifice and chicane;
the Protestants adhered to theits wvith firmness
and obstinacy. An account of every thing that
passed in Trient: was trranfmitted to the Em-
peror at Infpruck, who, attempting, from an
excef's of seal, or of confidence in his own ad-
dress , to reconcile the contending parties,
was involved in a labyrinth of inextricable net-
g~ociations. By means of this , however,
M~aurice gained all that he had in view; the
JEmperor's time was wyholly engrossed, and his
attention diverted; while he himself had lei-
fare to, mature his schemes, to carry on his
intrignes, and to finish his preparations, be-
fore he threw off the mark, and ftrack the blow
which he had to long meditated. y)

The Affairs of Hungary.

But previous to the hiffory of 1Vaurice's

operations, some account must be given of a

;y) Sleid. 526. Sep. F, Paul, 343* $38, Thuap, ag@Q,

bieiy revolutionl in Hungaryi, which contributed
not a little towards their producing such extra-
ordinary effeats. When Solyman, in the year
?54f, by a ithatagem, which faited the base
and insidious policy of a petty usurper, rather
than the magnanimity of a mighty conquoeror,
deprived the young King of Hungary of the
dominians which his father had left him, he
had granted that unfortunate Prince the country
of Transylvania , a province of .his paternal
kingdom. The government of this , together
with the care of educating the young King,
for he still allowed him to retain that title ,
though he had rendered it only an empty name,
he committed to the Queen and Mdartinuzzir
bithop of Warar~din, whom the late King had
appointed his sons guardians and regents of his
dominions, at a time when those o-ffces were
of greater importance. This co-ordinate jurif-
di~tion occasioned the fame di~tentions in a
fmnall principality as it would have excited in a
great kingdom; an ambitious young Queen ,
conscious of her capacity for governing, and
an high-fpirited prelate, fond of power , con-
tending who t~hould engross the greatest Chare
in the adrniniffration. Each had their partizans
among the nobles; but as 'Martinuzzi, by his
great talents,. began to acquire the ascendant,
Isabella turned his own arts against him, and
courted the prote~tion of the Turkis.

De

MYartinuzzi . favours Ferdinand~s pretenflons in that

kingdom.

The neighbouring Bathas , jealous of the

bifhop's power as well: as abilities , readily
promised her the aid which the demanded, and
would soon haveti bbliged M~artinuzzi to have
given up to her the fble dire~tion of affairs, if
his amnbition , fertile in expedients , had not
uggrefked ·to him a new meafate, and one that
tended not - only to preserve but to enlarge his
authority. Having conlcluded an agreement
wvith the Queen , by the i~nedi~ation· of forne of
the nobles , who were s~olicitous to s~ave their
country fromn the calamities of a civil waLr j he
secretly dispatched onle of his confidents to
Vienna , and entered into a negotiation with
Ferdinand. As it was no difficult matter to
persuade Ferdinand , that the A~me than whose
enmity and intrigues had driven him out of a
great part of his Hungarian dominions, might,
upon a reconciliation , become equally infkru-
mental in recovering them, he listened eagerly
to the first overtures of an union with that pre-
late. IMartinlzzi allured him by fach prof~pe~ts
of advantage, and engaged, with to much con-
fidence , that he would prevail on the most
powerful of the Hungarian nobles to take arms:
in his favour, that Ferdinand, notwithstanding
his truce with Solyman, agreed to invade Tran-
fyrlvania. The command of the troope deffined
for that service, consisting of veteran SpanifCh

Marquis de Piadena, an officer formed by the
famous Marquis de Pefeara, whom he firongly
resembled both in his enterprising genius for,
civil business , and in his great knowvledge in
the art of war. This army, more formidable
by the discipline of the soldiers , and the ab~ili-
ties of the general, than by its numbers, stras
powerfully se~conded by Mlartinnzzi and ~his
fa~tion among the Hun~garian. As the Turk-
iih Bathas, the Sultan himself be~ing' at the head
of his army on the frontiers of P-ersia , could
riot afford the Queen such immediate or effe~tual
afif~tance as the exigency of her affairs required,
the quickly loss all hopes of being able to retain
any longer the authority which the poffeired as
regent , and even began to defpIair of her fon's
safe ty.

The faccefs of his meafares,

M~artinuzzi did not fulffer this favourable

opportunity of accomplithing his own defrgns
to pass: uniimproved, and ventured, while the
was in this state of dejef~tion , to lay before
her a proposal1, which at any other time she
would have rejefted with disdain. }Ie repre-
fented how impofi~ble it was for her to refiit
Yerdinand's vic'orious arms; that even if the
Tilrks thould enable her to make h~ead against
them, the would be far from changing her con-
gition to the better, and could not conlfider:

them: as deliverers, but as maiters, to whof's~
counnands~ the must submit; he conjured her,
therefore , a~s: he regarded her own dignity,
the safety of her son, or the s~ecurity of Christen-
dom, rather to give up Tradyjlvania to Ferdi,
mand, and to. make over to himt her fon's title
to the crown of Hungary , than to allowj hoth
to be usurped by the inveterate enemy of the
Christian faith;. At the famre time he promilieQ
her, in Ferciinand's name, a compensation for
herself, . as well as for her fan, fyitable to their
rank, and proportional to the value of what
they were to . sacrifice. Isabella, deserted by;
some of her adherents , diffrsfting oth~ers, de-.
fitutte of friends, and fuxrr-ounded by Caffaldo's
and IVfartinu2:zi troops , fuzbfcribedl there hard
conditions, though with a reludtant hand, Upon
this, the surrendered fotch places of strength as
were still in her poffefilon, the gave up all the
enligns of royalty , particularly a crown of
gold, which, as the Hungarians believed, had
des~cended from b~eaven, and conferred on hina
who wore it an undoubted right to the throne,
As the could' not bear to remain a private per-
s~on, in a country where the had once enjoyed
s~overeign power, tChe inflantly set out with her
son for Silesia, in order to take poireflron of
the principalities of Oppeln and Ratiber, the
investiture of which Ferdinand had eng-aged to
grant her son, and likewvife to bestow one of
his daughters upon him in marriage.

Appointed governor of that part of Hunqgary which was

Sfubjea to Ferdinand.

Upon the resignation of: the young King,

IVlartinuzzi, and after his example the reit of
the TranSylvanian grandees, swore allegiance
to Ferdinand I who, in order to tekitfy his grate-
ful sens~e of the zeal as well as faccefs with
which that prelate had served him, affeaed to
distinguish him by every poffble mark of favour
and confidence. He appoisted him governor of
Transylvania, with almoR unlimited authority;
he ordered Caffaldo to pay the greatest deference
to his opinion and commands; he increased his
revenues, which were already very great, by
new appointments;~ he nominated him archbishop
of Gran , and prevailed on the Pope to raise
him to the dignity of a Cardinal. All this of--
tentration of good-will, however, was void of
sincerity, and calculated to conceal sentiments
the most perfe~tly its reverse. Ferdinand dread-
ed 1Vartinuzzi's abilities, diffrofted his fidelity ,
and foresaw, that as his extensive authority
enabled him to check any attempt towards cir-
cumferibing or abolithing the extensiv-e privileges
which the Hungarian nobility poffeffed, he
would Rand forth, on every occasion, the guar,
dian of the liberties of his country, rather than
a&t the part of a viceroy devoted1 to the will
of his sovereign,

Ferdinand begins to form designs againit him.

For this reas~on , .hc s~ecretly gave it in

charge t~o Caffaldo to watch his motions , to
guard against his designs, and to thwart: his
aneafaures. But M~artinuzzi, either because he
did not p~erceive that Caffaldo was placed as a
fpgy on his a~ions, or becaus~e he depiried FerT
dinand's insidious arts, aff'umed the dire~tion of
the war against the Turks with his uiual tone
of authority, and condu~ted it with great ma.~
gnanimity, and no less facecef~s. He recovered
fomre places of which the Infidels had taken pof-
feilion; he rendered their attempts to reduce
others abortive; and established Ferdinand's au-
thority not only in Trans~ylvania, but in the
Banna~t of Temefwvar , and f'everal of the couln-
tries adjacent. .1In carrying on these operations,
he often diflFered in s~ent~iments from Caffaldo and
his officers, and treated the Turkish pris~oners

method of courting the friends~hip of the Infi-

might thake off all dependence upon the fove-
reign whom he now acknowledged. Though

Ferdinand, whom neither gratitude for recent
and important: services, nor reverence for a-

among Christians, could restrain from t~hedding
the blood of a rnan, whose only crime was at-

[picuous for his merit than his rank, -·to be
butchered by affaffms, either retired' to their

trian army, grew cold to the service. The
Turks, encouraged by the death of an enemy
whole abilities they knew and dreaded, pre--
pared to renew hostilities early in the spring;
and instead of the security which Ferdinand had
expeaed from the removal of Martinuzzi, it
was evident: that his, territories in Hungary
were about to be .attackied with gretater vigfour,
and defended with less zeal, than ever. a)

Maurice courts the prote~tion of the Fren ch King,

By this time, Miaurice having almoff finish-

ed his intrigues and preparations, was on the
point of declaring his intentions openly, and
of taking field against the Emperor, His first
care, after he came to this res~olution , was to.
disclaim that narrow and bigoted maxim of the
confederates of Smalkalde, which had led there
to ifhun all connexuion with foreigners. He had
observed how fatal this had been to their cause,
and infirudted by their error, he was as eager
to court the prote~tion of Henry II. as they had
been solicitous to prevent the interposition of
Francis I. Happily for him, he found Henry
in a difpolition to listen to the first overture on
his part, and in a ficuation which enabled him
to bring the whole force of the French mo-.

under his prote~tion; and hoffilities were al-
ready begun, not only in that dutchy but in
Piedmont. H-avin~g terminated the war with
England by a peace, no less advantageous to
himsel~f ·than honourable for his allies the Scots,
the restles~s and enterprizing courage of his no-
bles was impatient to display itself on some
theatre of a~tion more conspicuous than the
petty operations in Parma, or Piedmont afford-
ed them.

His treaty with him.

John de· %ieffe, bishop of Bayonne, whom

Henry had sent into Germany, under pretence
of hiring troops to be employed in Italy, was
empo~wered to conclude a treaty in form with
M~raurice and his affrociates. As it wouldt have
been very indecent in a King of France to have
u'ndertaken the defence of the Protellant church,
the interests of religion, how much soever they
might be affefted by the treaty, were not once
mentioned in any of the articles. Religious
concerns, they pretended to commit entirely to
the disposition of Divine Providence; the only

motives alligrned for. their present confederacy
against Charles, were to procure the Landgrave
liberty, and to prevent the fabverflon of the
ancient conflitution and laws of-the German
Empire. In order to accomplish there ends, it
was agreed , that all the contrading parties
tihould, at the fame time, declare war against
the Emperor j that neither peace nor trace
thould be made but by common content, nor
without including each of the confederates ;
that, in order to guard against the ineonvenien-
cles of anarchy , or of pre~tenflons to joijnt com-
Itnand , Mlaurice fbould be acknowledged as head
of the German confederates, with absolute au-
thority in all military affairs, that Maurice and
his associates thould bring into ~the field seven
thousand horse, with a proportfonal number of
infantry; that, towards the fubfifrenlce of this
army , during the three first months of the war,
Henry thould contribute twfo hundred and forty
thouf'and crowns, and afterwards sixty thousand
crowins a-month, as long as they continued in
arms; that Henry thould attack the Emperor
on the fide of Lorrain with a powerful army;
that: if it were found requisite to eted a new
Emperor, such a person thould be norninated
as shall be agreeable to the King of France. b)
This treaty was concluded on the fifth of Oc-
tober, some time before Mlagdeburgr surrendered ,

Diemarnds once more that the Landgrave fbouM~ be ft* at

liberev .

l~aurice, however, having secured the pror-

~teion of such a powerful Mlonarch as Henry II.
proceeded with great confidence, but with
equal cautioni, to eiecute his plan. As he
judged it neceirary to make one effort more ,
in order to obtain the Emperor's content that
the Landgrave thould be fCet at liberty, he sent
(December. I551.) a solemn embaffyr, in his
own namei and in that of the Eledtor of Bran-
denburg, to Infprck. After refatming, at great
length, all the fasts and arguments upon which
they founded their claim , and representing, in
thfe fir~ongeft terms, the peculiar engagements
wvhich bound them to be to aldlidous in their
folicitations, they renewed th~e request in behalf
of the unfortunate prisoner, which they had to
bften preferred in vain. The Eledtor Palatine,
the Duke of 'Wurtemnberg, the Dukes of ~ee-
klenburgj the Dukre of Deuxponts, the Marquis
of Brandenburg Bareith, and the Marquis of
Baden , by their ambassadors , concurred with
them in their suit. Letters wrere likewise de-
livered to the fame effe&t from the King of
Denmark, the Duke of Bavaria, and the Dukes
of Lunieburg. Even the King of the Romans
joined in this application, being moved with
compaflilon towards the Landg~rave in his wretch-
ed situation, or influenced. perhaps, by a fe-
ere jealousy of his brother's power and designs,

which, since his .attempt to alter the order of(
faxccellion; in the Empire, he had come to
view with other eyes, and dreaded to a great:
degree.~

But Charles, constant to his own fyf~em

wCith regard to the L~andgrave , eluded a de..
mand urged by such powerful interceffors; and
having declar~ed that he would communicate his
refoalution concerning the matter to IMaurice as
soon as he azrrivied at minpruck, where he was
every day expe~ted, he did not deign to descend
into anly more particular explication of his in-
tentions. d) This application, though of no.
benefit toi the Landgrave, was of great advan-
tage to Maurice. It served to justify his fauble-
quent proceedings, and to demonfirate ~the ne-
cellity of employing arms in order to extort that
equitable concei'ilon, which his mediation or
intreaty could not obtain. ,It was of are, too,.
to confirm the Emperor in his fbcurity, as both
the solemnity of the application, and the f'oli-
citude with which to~ many Princes were drawn
in, to enforce it, led him to conclude , th~at:
Maurice placed all his hopes of refforing the
Landgrave to liberty, .in gaining h'is content to
difmits him.

M~aurice continues to amuse the Emperor.

Miaurice employed artifices flill more re-

fined to conceal his machinations , to amufie
the Emperor, and to gain timre. He affeaed
to be more s~olicitous than ever to find out: some
expedient for removing the difficulties with re-
gard to the ifaf-conldu&~ for the Protestant divines
appointed to attend the council, so that they
mig~ht repair thither without any apprehenflon
of danger. His ambassadors at Trent had fre-
quent conferences concerning this matter with
the Imperial ambassadors inl that city, and laid
open their sentiments to them with the appear-
ance of the most unrefierved confidence. He
was willing , at last , to have it believed,
that he thought all differences with refped to
this preliminary article w~ere on the point of
being adjus~ted; and in order to give credit
to this opinion, he commanded Melan~thon, to-
-gether with his brethren, to set out on their
journiey to Trent. At the fame time, he held
a close correspondence with the Imperial court
at Infpyrack, and renewed on every occasion
his profeflons not only of fidelity but ofattach-
ment to the Emperor. He talked continually
of his intention of going to Infpruck in person;
he ordered a house to ;be hired for him in that
city, and to be fitted up w-ith the greatest diC-
patch for his reception. e)

th~e arts of deceit, and impenetrable as he thought:
the veil to be , underr which he concealed his
designs, the're were several things it~ his cott-
du~t which alarmed the Emperor amidst his fe.
curity and tempted him frequently to fa fpe&
that he wnas meditating fomnething extraordinary.,
As thefb fuxfpicions took their rife from circumr-
fiences inco~nsiderable in themfielve~s, or of an
ambiguous as well as uncertain -nature, they
wfere inore than counterbalanced by Maurice s
addrers; and the Emiperor would not, lightly,
give up his confidence in a man, whodm he had
once trtifted arid loaded with favours. One par-
'ticular alone seemed to be of sauch consequence,
that he thought it neceffkry to demand an ext-
plaination with regard toi it. The troops, wvhich
Greorge of I~jiecklenbitrg had taken into pay after
the capitulation of Magdeburg , having fixed
their' qularters in TIhutingia, livied at diferetion
·on the lands of the rich ecclefiafticks in their
neighbourhood. 'I'heir licence and rapacious-
ness vc'ere intolerable. Such as felt or dreaded
their exa~ions, complained 10adly t~o the Em-
petor, and represented them as a body of men
kept: in readiness for s~ome desperate enterprize.
But Maurice, partly by extenuating the enor-
mities of which they had been guilty, partly
by repres~enting the impoffxbility of disbanding;

thef'e troops, or of keeping them to regular
dis~cipline, u~nlers the arrears itill due to them-
by the Emperor were paid, either removed the
apprehensions whic~h this had occasioned, or ,
as Charles ~was not in a .condition to fagtisfy the
demands of ther~e soldiers, obliged him to. be
silent with regard to the matter. f)

MSaurice prepares for aaion.

The time of a~ion was now ~approachinig·

MRaurice- had privately dis~patched Allbert ofBran-
denburg to Paris, in order to confirm his league
with H~enfy, and to hasten thre march of the
French army. He had taken measures to b~ring
his own fabjefis together on the first s~ummons;
he had provided for the security of Saxony
w~hile he t~hould be absent with the army; and
he held the troops in Thuringia, on which he
chiefly depended, ready to advance on a mo-
ment's warnin~g. All ther'e complicated operations
were carried on without being discovered byt
the court at Infprack, and the Emperor re-
mained there in perfeat tranquillit~y, bussed en-
tirely in counteradting the intrigues of the Po.
pe's legate at Trent, an in fettling the condi.
tions on which the Protefiant divrines thould be
admaitted into the council, as if there had not:

been any tranfac~ion of greater moment` in
agitation.

, ircurntances which contributed to deceive the ·Emperor;.

This credulous Tecurity iis a' Prince, who ,

by his sagacity in observing ttpe conduft of all
around him, wa~s commnonly led to an excess
of diffraft, may seem unaccountable, and has
been imputed to infatuation. But besides the
exquisite address with which M~aurice concealed
his intentions, two circumstances contributed to
the deluflon. Thle gout had returned upon
Charles soon after his arrival at Infpruck, with
an increase of violence; and his conftiturtion
being broken by such frequent attacks, he was
fieldom able to exert his natural vigour of mind,
or to confider affairs with his usual vigilance and
penetratioii; aind Granvelle, bishop of Arras ,
his prime miniffer, though one of the most
fabtle flatermen of that, or p'erhaps of any age,
was on this occasion the dupe of his own craft.
He entertained fatch an high opinion of his own
a~bilities , and held the political talents of the
Germans in fach contempt, that he despised all
the intimations giveii him concerning M~aurice's
f~iecrext machinat~ions , or the dangerous designs
which he was carrying on. When the Duke of
A3lva, whose dark fulfpicious mind hiarbouredl
many doubts concerning the Ele~tor's sincerity,
proposed calling him immediately to court to
answer Tor his condu~t, Granvelle replied withP

great scorn, that there apprehenflons wferq
groundless, and that a drunken German head
was too gross ,to form any ~scheme which he
could not e ffily: penetrate and baffle,~ Nor did
he affame this peremptory tone merely from
confidence in his own discernment; he had brib-
ed twcto of lMaurice's. ministers, and received from
them frequent and minute information concern-.
ing all their mafter's motions. But through this
very channel, by which he expeated to gain
accef's to all Maurice's coun~el~s·, - and even to
his .thoughts, s~uch initelligence was conveyed
to him as completed his decep~tion.; Muaurice
fortunately dificov~ered the correspondence of the
two traitors with Granvelle, but instead of pu-
nifhing them for their crime, he dexterously
availed himf'elf of their fraud, and turned his
own arts against the bifhlop. He affe~ted to
treat there ministers with greater confidence
than ever; he admitted them to his conf'ultal-
tions; he s~eemed to lay open his heart to them;
and taking care all the while to let them be ac-
quainted with nothing but what it was his in-
terest t'hould be known, theyv transmitted to
Inf~pruck such accounts as poffeffe-d Granvelle
with a firm belief of his sincerity as wrell as
good intentions. g) The Emperor himself . inl

fidelity as well as attachment of ilx~at Prince. b)

IVaurice t~akes the fseld against the Emperor.

At last~ Maurice's prep~arations were com-

pleted, and he had the Tatisfa~tion to find that
his initrignes -and designs were skill unknown.
But, though· now ready to take the field, he
did not lay aside the arts which he had hitherto
employed; and by one piece of craft more, he
deceived his enemies a few days longer. He
gare out, that he was about to begin that
journey to Infipruck of which he had to often
talked:, and he took one of the miniffers whom
Granvelle- hard bribed; to attend him thither.
After travelling post a few flages, he pretend-
ed to be indisposed by the fatigue of the journey,
and dispatching the fisfpefte4 minister to make
his apology to the Emperor for this delay, and
to allure him that he would be at Infprucke
within a few days; he mounted on horseback,
as soon as this spy on his a~ions was gone,
rode full speed towards Thuringia , joined
(Mlarch. 18.- 052.) his army, which amo~untr

Pubithes a manifekto juffifying his conduff.

At the fame time he published a manifeffo

containing his reasons for takring ~arms. These:
were three in number : That .he might secure
the Proteffant religion, which was threatened
with immediate deftru~tion ; that he might
maintain the constitution and l.aws of the E~mT
pire, and save Germany from being fubjeieed
to the dominion of an absolute monarch; that
he might deliver the Landgrave of Hesse from
the miseries of a long and unjust .imprifornment.
By the first, he ro-utedl all the favourers of the
Reformation , a party formidable by their zeal
as well as numbers, and rendered d~efperrate by
oppres~sion. By the second , he interef~red all
the~ friends of liberty, Catholickis no les~s than
Proteftents, and made it the~ir iatereft to unite
with him in asserting the rights and privileges
common to both. The third, besides the glory
which he acquired by his zeal to fulfil his en-
gagements to the unhappy prisoner , was be-
come a cause of general concern, not only from
the comnpa~iion which the Landgrave's fuferings

Saxon spinift~ers whom Granvelle had bribed , are nor
mentioned by the German hifforians; but as Sir James
Melvil received his in~foruation from thie Eledtor Palatine ,
and as they are perfec~ly ag-reeable to the reft of Maa-
rice's condud, they may- be coaidered as authenticki,

and ·rigour of the E~mperor's proceedings against
him. Together with Mlaurice's manifeffo, an-
other appeared in the name of Albert Marquis
of ·Brandenburg 'Culmnbach, who had joined him
with a body of'adlventurers whom he ~had drawn
together. Therl-ame~ grievances which Maurice
had p~ointed out :are- mentioned in it, but with
at - excess of avirulence and animosity suitable
to ;the ciharad~t er of the Prince in w~hole name

He is po~werfully supported by the French King·*

·· - The: Kitigi of France added to there a mani-,
fbffo in his .own name; in which, after taking
n~oice of the ancient alliance between th e
Frent-h and German nations , both descended
from the- fame anceffor-s; and after mentioning
the applications , which , in consequence ·of
this , some of the molt illuffrious among the
German Princes had. made to him for his pro-
teftion; he declared, that he now took arms
to re -eft~ablifih the ancient conflitution of the
Empire, to deliver some of its Princes fromn
captivity , and to s~ecure the privileges and in-
dependence of all' the members of the Germanick
body. In this mlanifefto, Henry assumed the
extraordinary title of Prote~tor of the Liberties
of Germany, and of its captive Princes; and
there was engraved on· it: a cap , the ancient:
symbol of freedom , placed between two dag-.

gers , in order to intimate to thie Germans ,
that this blefirng wa~s to be acquired and fecur-
ed by force of arms. i)

Maurice's operations in the field.

lMaurice had now a very different part to

a&t, but his flexible genius was capable of ac-
commodating itrelf to every· fltuation. The
moment he took arms , he was as bold and
enterprizing in the field , as he had been can-
tious and crafty in the cabinet. He advanced
by rapid marches towards the Upper Germany.
All the towns in his way opened their gates
to him. He reinstated the magistrates whbom
the Emperor had depos~ed , and gave pol~fkfion
of the churches to the Protestant miniff ers w-hom
he had eje~ted. He dire~ted his march to
Augsburg, and as the Imperial garrison, which
was too inconsiderable to think of defending
it , retired immediately , he t~oo pofifeiion
(April r. x552.) of that great city, and made
the fame changes there as in tile tow~ns through
which he had passed. k)

nifhment and consternation at: events f'o unex-

pe~fed. HIe saw a great number of the German
Princes in arms against him, and the reft either
ready to join themi or withing fauccefs to their:
enterprize. He beheld a powerful. Monarch
united with them in close league , s~econding
their operations in person at the head of a for-
midable army, while be, through negligence
and credu~lity., which exposed -him no les~s to
scorn than to danger, had neither made, nor
w~s· in condiition to make , any effedtual pr~o-
viflon, either for crushing his rebellious fuxb-
jets , or· r~efifing the invasion of the foreign
enemy. Part of hi~s Spanis~h troops had been
ordered into Hungaqryr a~ganft the Turks; the
reff had marched back to Italy upon occaflon
of the war in 'the dutchy of Parma. The bands
of veteran Glermans had been difminifed, because
he was not able to pay them; or had entered
into Mauzrice's s~ervice after the siege of 1Magde-
burg ; and he remained at Infprarck with a
body of soldiers hardly fkrong enough o guard
his own pers~on. His treasury was as much
exhauffed, as his army was reduced. He had
received no remit~tances for fiomne timne fromr the
new world. He had forfeited all credit with
the merchants of Genoa and Venice, who re-
fused to lend· him money, though tempted by
the offer of exorbitant interest. T~hus Charles,
though undoubtedly the most considerable poten-
tate in Chriffendom, and .capable of exerting
the greatest fkrengrth, as his power, notwitha-

ihanding the violent attack made upon it, was
full unimpaired, found hims~elf in a situation
which rendered him unable to make fach a
sudden and vigorous effor't as the jun~ure re-
quired , and was necessary to have saved him
from the pretent danger.

Endeavours to gain time by a negociation.

In this situation, the Emperor placed all

his hopes on negociating; the only resource of
fach as are conscious of their own weaknes~s.
But thinking it inconsistent with his dignity to
make the first advances to f~ubje~ts who were
in arms Aigainft him, he avoided that indecorurm
by employing the mediation of his brother Ser-
dinand. 1Vaurice confi'ding in his owNn talents
to condu&t any negociation in such a manner
as to derive advrartage' front it, and hoping that,
by the appearance of facility in hearkening to
the first overture of accommodation, he might
amute the Emperor, and tempt him to slacken
the aftivity with which he wTas now preparing
to defend himfelff, readily agreed to an inter-
view with Ferdin-and in the town of Lints in
Auffria: and having left his army to proceed
on its marcch under the co'mmfiandd of the Duke
of IViecklenburg, he repaired thither.

Progress of the French army.

Meanwhile the K~ing· of France pundually

fulfilled his engagements to his allies. He took

th~,field early, with a, numerous and well ap.
-pointed, army , and- marching .direAly into
Lorrain, ~Toul and Verdun opened their gates
at .his a~pproach. His forces atppeared next bec
fore IVMetz , and that city , by a, fraudulent
firatagem of the Confltable Monttnorency , who
having obtained permifflon to pass through it
with a finall gutard, introduced ais many troops
as Were rfaiicient .to ~overpower the garrison,
was likewise f'eized without bloodshed. Henry
made his entry into all these towns with great
pomp ; he obliged the inhabitants tol Ewear
allegiance to him', and annexed thofe' important
conquests to the French Monarchy. He left a
firong garrison in IMetz, From thence he ad-
vancehd towards Alsace , in order to attempt
new conquests, to which the fucceks that hard
hitherto attended his arms invited him. 1)

The negociations between the Emperor and Maurice

of no effea.

The conference at Lintz did not produce

any accommodation. Mlaurice, when he con-
f~ented to it, s~eems to have had nothing in view
but to amuse the Emperor; for he made s~uch
demands , both in behalf of his confederates
and their ally the French King, as he knew
would not be accepted by a Prince, too haughty
to submit, at once, to conditions didtated by

kn eneiny. But, however firmly Mvaurice ad-
hered during the negociation to the intereifs of
his associat~es , or how fteadly soever he kept in
view the objeats which had induced him to take
arms, he often profeffed a firong inclination to
terminate the differences with the Emperor in
an amicable manner. Encouraged by this ap-
pearance of a pacifick difpolition, Ferdinand pro-
posed a second interview at- Paff~an on tlfe twen,
ty-fixth of May, and that a truce thould com-
rnence on that day, and continue to the tenth
~of June, in order to give them leisure for ad-
juffing all the points in dis~pute.

Maurice advances towtards Infpruck.

Upon this, Maurice rejoined ,his army

on the ninth of MVay, which had now advanced
to Gundelfingen. He put his troops in motion
aext morning; and as sixteen days yet remain-
ed for a~tion before the commencement of the
tri~ce, he resolved , during that period , to
ventture upon an enterprize, the succes~s of which
would be to decisive, as would- render th~e ne-
gociations at Paffau extre'mely fbort, and en-
title him to treat upon his own terms. He
foresaw that the profpeEt of a cessation of arms,
which was to take place t'o soon, together with
the opinion of his earnestnes~s to re -establis~h
peace, with which he had artfully amused Ser-
dinand, could hardly' fail of inspiring the Em-
peror with such false hopes , that he would na-

turallyr becomie femits, and relapse into some
degree of that recurity which had already been
to fatal to him. Relying on this conjeaure,
he mnarched direaly- at the Ihead of his army
towards Infpruck, and advanced with the most
rapid motion that could be given to so great a
body o~f troops. On the eighteenth, he arrived
at Fieffen, a post of great consequence, at the
entraha~ into the Tyroletfe. There he found a
body of eight hundred men, wihom the Empe-
ror had~ assembled, ktronlgly intrenched, in order
to oppose his progrel's. He attacked them in-
ftantly with sauch violence and inipetuofity, that
they abandoned their lines precipitately, and ,
falling back on a second body posted near Ruten
communicated the panick terror with which
they themselves had been seized , to those
troops, so that they likewise took to flight, as-
ter a feeble resistance.

Elated with this fucceifs, which exceeded

hid knoft sangui~ne htope~sj Mauriee pressed for-
ward to Ehrenbergh, a caffle situated on an
high and iteep precipice, whieb commanded the
only psfs through the maountarins. As this fortt
had been s~urrendered to. the Proteffants at the
beginning of the Smalkaldick war, becarlnfe the
garrif'on was then too wveak to defend it, the

Emperr, Ienfible of its importance, had taken

~4care athi juoftare, to thrown into it a body

los troops fufficient to knaintain it againff the
greatest army. But a thepherd, in purs~uing si
goat which had firayed from his ~flock, having
dircovered an' unknown pith by which it was
pofirble to aftend to the top of the rock , came
with this seasonable piece of intelligence to
IVaurice. A small band of chosen s~oldiers, un-.
der the co~mmand of George of 1Vecklenburg ,
iwas instantly ordered to follow this guide. They
set out in the -evening, and clambering up the
rugged track with infinite fatigue as iwell as
danger, they reached the s~ummit unperceived;
and at an ·hour which had been concerted, when
M~aurice began the assault on the one fide of the
caffle, they appeared on the other, ready to
feale the walls, which were feeble in that:
Place, bec~ause it had beeni hitherto deemed in-
·necellible. The garrison, struck with terror at:
the fight of an enemy on a quarter where they
had thought themselves perfe~tly secure, imme-
diately threw down their arms. 1Vfaurice, al-
anoff without: bloods~hed , and twhicch wlas of
greater consequence to him, without Joss of
time, took poffefilon of a placej the reducftion
of which might have retarded him long, and

Maurice wais nowy only two days match

from Infiptudck, and without losing a momient
he orderied his infantr-y to savahce thither ,
hairing 'left hi~s cavalryi, which was unfervice-
~able in that miountainous counltry, at Fie~ffen,
to guard the m~outh of the pas~s. He proposed
to advance with fazch rapidity as to aLnticipate
any ·accounts of the loss of Ehrenberg~h and to
surprise the Empe~ror, together w7iith his atten.
dants, ' in an open townt· incapable of defence.
But just as his troops began to movte, a batta-
lion of mercenaries mutinied·, declating that:
they would not flir ilntil they had received the
gratuity , which,~ according to the 6uffom of
that age, they claimed as the recompence due
to them for having taken a plsite by as~sault. ·It:
was writh great diffEiculty , as well as danger,
and not~ without some confiderib~le loss of timne,
that Mlaurice q'uieted this infuxrre~tionj and pre-
vailed on the soldiers to followti him to a place
where he promised them fach rich booty as
would be an ample reward for all their services.

The Emperoi flies in confusion from Infpruck.

To the delay, occasioned by this unfore-

seen accident, the Emperor owed his safety.
H~e was informed of the approaching· danger
late in the evening, and knowing that nothing
could save him but a speedy flight, he instantly

left:

of' the night, - or the violence of the rain which
happened to fall at that time; and notwithfkand-
ing the debility occasioned by the gout, which
rendered him unable to bear any motion but
that of a litter, he travelled by the light of
torches, taking his way over the Alps, by roads
almost impafirble. His courtiers and attendants
followed him with equal precipitation , some of
them on such horses as tluty could hastily pro-
care, many of them on foot, and all in the
utmost conlfufion. In this miserable plight, very
unlike the pomp with which Charles had ap-
peared during the five preceding years as the
conqueror of Germany, he arrived at length
with his deje~ted train at Villach in Car~inthia,
and fearcely thought himself- secure even in that
remote inaccellible corney.

Mlaurice entered Inf'prack a few hours after

the Emperor and his attendants had left it,
and enraged that the prey thould eifeape out of
his hands when he was just ready to seize it,
he pursued them some miles; but finding it: im-
pofl~ible to overtake persons, to whom their fear
gave s~peed , he returned to the towrn, and aban-
doned all the Emperor's baggage , together with
that of his mihiffers, to be plundered by the
soldiers; while he preserved untouched every
thing belonging to the King of the Romnans,

only three days to the commencement of the

his operations ,) he set out for Paffau, that he
might meet Ferdinand on the day appointed.

'the Emperor sets the Ele~or of' Saxony at libetrty.

Before Charles left Infpruck , he wi~ithdrelW

the gulards placed ori the degraded 'Ele~ttr of'
Saxony , 'whom, during five lyears, he had
carried itbout with him as a p~iifoner; an~d set·
bish entirely at liberty7 , either with an inten-
toion to embarras~s ~IVaurice byr letting loos~e a ri-
val, who mig-ht diflpute his title to his dotni-
nions and dignity, or from a sens~e of the inde-
cency of detainmng him a prisoner, wvhi e he
himself run the rifkt of being deprived of his own
libierty. But that Prince, feeing no other way-
of escaping than that which the Emperor took,
and abhorring the thoughts of falling into the
hands of' a kridman , whom he justly considered
as the author of all his misfor tunes , chos~e
rather to accompany Charles in his flight, and
to expeL% the final d~eciiion of his fate from the
tareaty which was now approaching.

Ther~e were not~ the only effe £ts which Mau-

rice's op~erations produced. It was .no sooner
krnown at FTrent that he had taken arms , than
a general consternation s~eized the fathers of
the council. The German prelates immediately
returned home, that they might provide for
the· safety of their refp~eftive territories. The
reft were extremely impatient to be gone; and
the legate, who had hitherto disa8ppointed all
the endeavours of the Imperial ambafI~adors to
procure an audience in the council for the Pro-
teftant divines, laid hold with joy on fach a
plausible pretext for difmifflg an assembly ,
which he had found it to difficult to govern.
In a congregation held og the twenty-eighth of
April, a decree was ifrued proroguing the council
during two years, and appointing it to meet:
at the expiration of that time, if peace were
then re-established in E~urope. n) This pro-
rogation , however, continued no less than ten
years ; and the proceedings of the council,

of their le'gatis , by the ignorance of many of

digent Italian bishops , acquired fach influe~nce
in the councif , that they diftated all -its de-
crees, and f~~ramed themn not with an intention
-to reffore unity and concord to the church, but
to establish their owris domninion, or to confirm
those tenets, upon which they imagined that
dominion to be f~ounded. Do~tines, which had
'hitherto been admitted upon the credit of tra-
dition alone, and received with s~ome latitude
of in~terpretation, were now defined with a
femupulous nicety, and confirmed by the f~asc-
tion of authority. Rites, which had formerly
been· observed only in deference to custom su~p-
posed to be ancient, were established by the
decrees of the church, and declared to be es-
fential parts of its worthip. The breach, in-
Riead of being closed, was widened, and made
irreparable. In place of any attempt to recon-
cile the contending parties, a line was drawn
with fnch ftadied accuracy, as as~certained :and

still f'erves to keep them at a distance; and,
without some signal interposition of Divine
Providence , must render the f~eparattion pe~r-
-pet sal.

Chara~ter of thbe hittorians of this council.

Our knowledge of the proceedings of this

assembly,? is derived from three- different authors.
Father Paul of Venice wrote his history of the
Council of Trent, while the memory of what
had passed there was recent, and some who
had been members of it wrere ftill' alive. He
has exposed the intrigues and artifices by which
it was condult~ed, with a freedom and severity
which have given a deep wound to the credit
of the council. He has defecribed its delibera-
tions, and explained its decrees, with fazch
perspicuity and depth of thought, with fa-ch va-
rious erudition and such force of reas~on, as have
juffly entitled his work to be placed among the
ploft admired hifforical compositions. About
half a century thereafter, the Jesuit Pallavicirni
published his hjifory of the council, in op-
position to that of Father Paul, 'and by em-
ploying all the force of an acute and refining
genius to invalidate the credit, or to confatse
the reasonings of his antagonist, he labours to
prove, by artful apologies for the proceedings
of the council, and fuxbtile interpretations of
its decrees , that it deliberated with impar-

tiality , and decided writh judgment as well as
candour. Vargas , a Spanish do~tor of laws,
who was appointed to attend the Imperial am-r
baikiadors at Trent, .sent the bishop of Arras a
regular account of the tranfa~ifions there, ex-
plaining all the arts which, the Legate employed
to influence or over-awe the council, His
letters have been publited, in wihh n
veighs against the papal court with that afpe-
rity of censure, which was natural to a man
whole situation enabled him to observe its arts
thoroughly , and who was obliged to exert all
his attention and talents in order to disappoint
them. But w~hichs~oever of there authors ain in-
telligent person takes for his guide, in forming:
a judgment concerning the spirit of the couqcil,
"he must dis~c-over t'o much ambition as well as
artifice among some of the members, so much
ignorance and corruption amozig others; he muff
observe such a large infuflon of -human policy
and pafilons , mingled with fach a scanty por-
tion of that fitnplicity of heart , fadcity of man-
pers, and love of truth, which alone qualify
men to determine what do~trines are worthy of
God, and what worthip~ is' acceptable to him;
that he will find it no easy matter to believe,
that any extraordinary influence of the Holy
Ghost hovered over this asse~mbly, and didated!
Sts decrees.

The French endeavour to furprize Strafburgh;

·While Maurise was employed in negociat-

ing with the King of the Romnans at Lintz, or
in making war on the Emperor in the Tyrol,
the French Kinig had advanced into A iOce as
far as Strafburg; and ~having· demanded leave
of the Senate to march through the'city·, he
hoped that,' by repeating the fame fraud which
hie had pra~tired at Metz, he might render him-
,ifelf master of the place, and by that means f~e-
cure a paragLe over the Rhine into the heart of
Germany. But the Strafburg~her~s, infkrudted
and put on their guard by the credulity and
misfortune of their neighbours, rhut theilrgates
and having ar~embled a garrison of five thousand
soldiers, repaired their fortifications , rafed the
houtes in their suburbs , and determined to de-
fend themselves to the utmost. At the~ ~a~me
time they sent a deputatio~n of their most ref-
fpetanble citizens to the King, in order to di-
-vert him from making any hoffile attempt upon
them. T~he Eleffors of Treves and Cologne ,
the Duke of Cleves, and other Princes in the
neighbourhood, interposed in their behalf; be-
feeching Henry that he would not forget so soon
the title which he-had generoufjy assumed; and
inficad~of being the Deliverer of Germany, be-
come its Opprefor. The Swiss CantonS fe-
conded them with zeal, soliciting Henry to
ipare a city which had long been conne~ted with
their community in frienclfhip~ and alliance.

PIowerful as this united i~ntercefiron was, it:

would not have prevailed on Henry· to forego a
prize of so much value, if he had beenin acon-
.dition to hav~e seized it. ~But, in that age, the
mnethod of ~ubfift'ing 'numerous armries at a dif·-
·tance from the fronitielrs of their country, was
·imperfe~ly understood, and neither -the reve-
mues of Princes, nor their experience in the art
of war, were equal to the great and compli-
cated efforts which such an underta~kizig requir-
'ed. The French, though not far removed from
their own country, began already to fu~ffer from
f~earcity of proviflons, and had not fufficient
-magazines colle~ted to s~upport them during as
fl~ege, which must necessarily have been of great
length. o) At the fame time, the Queen of
Hungary , governess of the Low Countries, had
assemble~d a considerable body of troops, which,
under the command of Martin de R2offem, laid
waffe Champague , and threatened the adjacent:
provinces of France. TFhefe~ concurring circum-
stances obliged the King, though with reludt-
ance , to abandon the enterprize. But being
willing to acquire iome mrierit with his allies ,
'by this retreat wh~ich hne could -not ·avoid, he
pretended to the Swi~ifs th~at he had taiken the

the horses -in his army thould be led to drink in
the Rhine, as a proof of his having pushed
his conquests to far, he marched back towards
Champagne.

The operations of Albert of Brandenburg.

While the French King and the main army

of the confederates were thus employed, Albert
of Brandenburrg was entruAfed with the com-
mand of a separate body of eight thousand men,
conkfifting chiefly of mercenaries who had re-
sorted teo his standard , rather from the hope of
plunder, that the ex~pe~tation of regular pay.
That Prince, feeing himfeklf at the head of
foch a number of desperate adventurers, ready
to follow wherever he tLhould lead them, f~oonm
began to disdain a slate of faubordinationz, and to
form such vast schemes of aggrandizing hims~elf,
as seldom occur , even to ambitious minds, un-
les~s when civil war or violent fa~tions rode~
them to bold exertions, by alluring them wlith
immediate hopes of fuccers. Full of there afpir-
ing thoughts, Albert made war in a manner
very different from the other confederates. He
endeavoured to spread the terror of his arms by
the rapidity of his motions, as well as the ex-
tent and rigour · of his devastations; he exafted
contributions wherever he came , in order to

amats fach a fum of money, as would put it in
his power to kee'p his army together; he la-
boured to get 'pi~ffieffion of Nuremberg, Ulm,
or fiome other of the free cities in Upper G~er-,
maihy, in which, as a capital, he thnight fix
the feat qs his power. But, findijng ther'e cities
on their guard , and in a condition to resist his
aettcks, he turned azll his rage, ag~ainst the po-
pith ecclefralticks, -whose territories he plan,-
dered with s~uch wanton and me~rciless barbari-
ty as gave them a very unfavourable impreflion
of the spirit of that )eformation in religion,
with zeal for which he pr~etended t& be ani-
mated. TPhe biifhops of Bambergh and W-urz-
burgh, by their situation, lay particularly ex-,
posed to his ravages; he obliged the former to
transfer to him , in pr operty , almofit one' half
of his~ extensive diocese; and compelled the.
lat~ter to advance an immefe fam in order to
save his country from ruin and desolation. Dur-
ing all thos~e: wild fagllies, Albert paid no regard
either to M/aurice's orders, whos~e commands as
GeneraifiTmo of the- league he had engaged to
obey , or to the remonfkrances of the other
confederates ; and manifestly discovered, that
he at~tended only -to his own private emolum-
ment,, without any solicitude about the common
caus~e, or the general obje~ts which had induced
them to take arms. q)

,he~ n~egociatjons of peace at Paffau.

IVisarrice having ordered his army to mar~ch.

back into gbayariar and having publithed a pro-.
clamation enjoining the Lutheran clergy an~d
Sinfiruaftrs ps youth , to refame the elxercif"e of
'their fun ,op~s in all the cities, schools , and.
uniiveriitieg from which they had been ejected,
~met Ferdinland at Pafiau on the twenty - ixuth
day of IVay. As 'matte~rs of the greatest con-
feauence to the future peace and independence
of the Empire were to be fettled in this con-
grer~s, the eyes of all Germiany were fixed upon

i.Befides ?Ferdinand and the Imperial ambaf-

lfadors, the Duke of Bavaria , the bi-shops of
Saltzburgh2 and Aichfiadt, the miniffers of all
the Eledors, together wvith deputies from most
of the considerable Princes and fr~ee cities, re-
s~orted to Paffau. Mlaurice, in name of his afro-
ciates, and the King of the Romans as the Em-
perorts representative, - opened the negociation.
The Princes who were g-efent , together with
the deputies of fqlch as were absent, a~ed as
inte~rceffors or mediators betwceen thjem.

The terms which Maurice proposed,

Maiirice, in a long discourse, explained the

mnotives of his own condu~t. After having
enumerated all the unconstitutional and oppref-
five a~ts of the Emperors adminiffration, he,
agreeably to the manifeffo which he had publith-

ed when he took arms againik him , limited
his demands to three articles. That the Land..
gra~ve- _of Hes~se tihould be immpediatel~y· At at
1111111111Illlllll~~ibry that the grievances in the~civil govern-
ihent of the: Empire thould be -fedreffed; and.
thiat the 'Proteffints tihould be allowetd the pu-
blick exercise~ of their religion withount molefai-
tion. FEerd~inand and the Imperial· ambassadors
discovering ·their unwillingners to gratify him
with regard to 4ll there points, the mediators
wrote a joint letter to the Emperor, beSeeching:
him to delive~r Germany from the calamities of
a cjivi war, by giving such ~a~tisfaaion to IVau-
rice and his party as might induce them to lay
down their arms; and at the fame t'ime they
prevailed upon I~laurice to grant a prolongation
of the truce for a fihort time , during which
they undertook to procure the Emperor's final
a~frwer to his demands.

Powerfully fupportedl by the Princes of the Emp~ire.

This request wagretented to the Emperor

in the name of all the Princes of the Empire',
Popithi as well as Protestant , in the name of
sUch as had lent an helping hand to forward
his ambitions fichemes, as wrell aLs of those who
had viewed the progres~s of his power with
jestlodfy and dread. The uncommon and cordial
unanimity with which they concurred at this
jundture in enforcing IVaurice's demands, and
in recommending peace, flowed from different

causes. Such as were inof attached to the
Roman· catholickr church could not help obfery-
inr, that ,the Protefiant confederates were at
the head of a numerous army , while the Enti-
peror w~as ,but juff beg~inn~ing to provide for his
owrn defence. They foref'aw that great efforts
would be req~uired of them, and would be ne-
ceffary on thieir part , in order to cope with
enemies , who ha~d been allowed to get the
start so far, and to attain fach formidable power.
Exuperience had taught themn, that the fruit of
all there efforts would be reaped by the Em-
peror alone, and the more~ complete any vi~ory
proved which they thould gain, the faster would
'they bind their own fetters, and render them
the more intolerable. Ther~e refle~ions made
them cautious how they contributed a second
-time, by their indis~creet zeal , to put the Em-
peror in poffefiion of power which would be
fatal to the liberties of their country. Notw~ith-
standing the implacable fierceness of the spirit
of bigotry in that age, they chose rather that
the Proteffants tfhould acquire that security for
their religion which they demanded , than by
assisting Charles to oppref's them, to give s~uch
additional force to the Imperial prerogative , as
would overturn the constitution of the Empire.
To all there considerations, ·the dread of feeing
Germany laid waffe by a civil war, added new
'Fhree. Mfany Rtates of the Empire already felt
the ideffrudfive 'rage of Albert's arms, others

dreaded it, and all withed for an accommnoda-P
tion betw~een the Emperor 'and M~auric~e, which
.they Ifope~d would save them from that cruel
scourge.

The motives w-rhich influenced the Emperor at this

junauhre.

Suiih were the reasons that induced to mnany

Prinesd -notwithstanding the variety of their
political interests , and the opposition in their
religious sentiments, to unite in recommending
to· the Emperor an accommodation with MR~au-
rice, not only as a fa8lutaryl but as a necessary
meas~ure. The motives which promp~ted Chare
les to desire it , were not fewer or of les~s
iWteig-hti H~e w~as perfe&1ly sensible of: the fb~pe-
.riority which the confederate's had acquired
.through his own negligence; and he now felt:

the infufficiency of his own resources to oppose
rthem. H~is Spatnifh ~ubje ts , difguffed. at his,
long abs~ence , and weary of endless wars ,
which were of no benefit to their' country,, re-
fused to furnit~h him any considerable A~pply
either of men or money; and althoug~h by his
address or importunity he might have hoped
to draw from them at last more effe~tual aid,
that , he knew, was too diff ant to be of any
service in the prefeat exigency of- his affairs.
His treafary was drained; his veteran forces
were dispersed, or dis~banded, and he could not
depend much' either~ on the fidelity or courage.

of the new levied soldiers whom he was col-
leaing. There was tlo hope of repeating with
success the fame artifices which had weakened
and ruined the Smalkaldick league. ABs the
end at which he aimed was now known, he
could no longer employ the specious pretexts ,
which had formerly concealed his ambitious
~designs. Every Prince in Germany was alarmed
and on his guard; and it was vain to think of
blinding them a second time to fach a degree,
as to make one part. of them instruments to
enslave the other. The spirit of a confederac~y,
whereof Maurice was the head, experience had
taught him, to be very different from that of
the league of Smalkalde ; and from what he
had already felt, he had no reason to flatter
_himfielf that its counsels wTould be as irresolut~e,
or its efforts as timid and feeble. If he thould
res~olve on continuing the war , he might be
afrured , that the most conflderable states in
Germany would take part in it against him;
and a dubious neutrality was the utmost he
could expe~t from the reft. While the con-
federates found full employment for his arms
in one quarter, the King of France would s~eize
the favourable opportunity , and pus~h on his
operations in another, with almost certain s~ue-
ces~s. That monarch hadr alreadv mzade conquest~s
in the Empire, which he was no les~s eager to
recover, than impatient to be revenged on him
for aiding his mtalecontent fabje~ts. Though

Henry had now retired fromn the banks of the
Rhine, he had only varied the feene of hoffili-
ties', having invaded the Low ·Countries with
a11 his forces. The Turks, ronfed by the soli-
citations of the French King, as well as itimu.
lated -by resentment againit Ferdinand for hav-
ing violated the truce in Hungary, had prepar-
ed a p~owerful fleet to ravage the coaits of
Naples and Sicily, which he had left almoff
defenceless, by calling thence the greatest part
of the regular tiroops .to join the army which he
was now assembling.

Ferdinand zealous to promote an accommodation.

Ferdinand, who went in person to Villach,

in order to lay before the Emperor the refuzlt of
the conferences at Paff~au, had likewis~e reasons
peculiar to himself for desiring an accommoda-
tion. These prompted him to s~econd, with
the greatest earneftne~s , the arguments which
the Princes assembled there had employed in
recommending it. He had observed, not with-
out secret: fatisfation , the fatal blow that had
been given to the defpotick power, which his
brother had usurped in the Empirie. He was ex-
tremely solicitous to prevent Charles from re-
covering what he had loft , as he fores~aw that
he would immediately refazme, with frethl eager-
nes~s, and with a better chance of succes~s, his
favourite f~eheme of transmitting that power to

his

his limn, by excluding him from the right of
faccei'Ton to the Imperial throne. On this ac-
count, he was willing to contribute towards
circumferibing the Imperial authority, in order
to render his own poffefion of it certain. Bes1-
des , Solyman, exasperated at the 10f~s of Tran-
fylvania, and s~till more at the fraudulent arts by
which it had been f'eized, bad ordered into the
field an army of an hundred thousand men ,
which having defeated a great body of Ferdi-
nand's troops, and taken f'everal places of im-
portance, threatened not only to complete tl'e
conqlueft of the province, but to drive them out
of that part of Hungary which was itill faubje&t
to his jurifdi~tion. He was unable to resis~t fach
a: mighty enemy; his brother, whil~e engaged
in a domeffick war, could afford him no aid;
and he could not even hope to draw from Ger-
many the contingent, either of ·tro~ops or money-,
usually furniihed to repel the invasions of thle
Infidels. MVaurice, having observed Ferdinand's
p~erplexity with regard to this last point, had
offere~d, if peace were re-eftabl~ifbed on afrecure
foundation., that he would march in person with
his troops into Hungary against the Turks. Such
was the effe& of this well-timed proposal, tha-t
Ferdinand, destitute of every other profped of
relief , became the most zealous advocate whom
the confederates could have chosen to urge their
claims, and there was hardly any thing that
they could have demanded which he would not

hanve chosen to grant, rather than have retarded
a pacification, to which he trusted as the only
means of saving his H~ungarian crown.

C'ircumffances wh~ich retatrd it.

Whe'n s~o many causes confjpired in render-

ing ari accommodation elig~ible, it might have
been expe~ted that it would have takren place
immediately. But the inflexibility of the Em-
peror's temper, together with his unwillingnefis
at once to reinquiifh objeas which he had long
purfixed with such earnefl-nefs and afirduity,
counterbalanced, for some ti'me, the force of
all -the motives which disposed him to peace,
and not only put that event at a difiance, but
s~eemed to render it uncertain. WThen Maurice's
demands, together with the letter of the me-
diators at Paff'au, w7ere pres~ented to him, he
pereniptorily refused to redress: the grievances
which were pointed out, nor would he agree
to any fipiulation for the immediate f'ecurity of
the Protestant religion , but propos~ed referring
'both there to the determination of a "future diet.
On his part,- he required that instant reparation
thould be made to all who, during the pres~ent
war, had fuffered either by the licentiousnes~s
of the confederate troops, or the exa~ftions of
their l-eaders.

Ma~urice~'s vijgorous operations facilitate it.

Mlaurice, who was well acquainted with

the Emperor's arts, immediately concluded that
he had nothing in view by there overtures but
to amdue and deceive; and therefore , with out
listening to Ferdinand's intreaties, he left Paffau
abruptly , and joining his troops wrhich were
encamped at Mlergentheim, a cityT in Franconia,
belonging to the knights of the Teutonick or-
der, he put them in motion, and renewed hof-
tilities. As three thous~and men in the Empe-
ror's payv had~ thrown themselves into Fsrankfort
on the M~aine, and might from thence infelith~e
neighbouring country of Hesse, he marched
to wards that city and laid siege (July II. I=52.z·)
to it in form. The brifkrnef's of this enterprize,
and the vigour with which 1Vaurice carried on
his approaches against the town, gave fach an
alarm to the Emperor, as disposed him to lend
a more favourable ear to Ferdinand's arguments
in behalf of an accomodation. Firm and haughty
as his nature was, he found it necessary to
bend, and lignified his willingners to make con-
ceflons on his part, if Mlaurice, in return ,
would abate somewhat of the rigour of his de-
mands. Ferdinand, as soon as he perceiced that
his brother began to yield, did not desist from
his impor tunities , until he prevailed on him to
declare what was the utmoff that he would
grant for the security of the confederates. Hay-
ing gained this diffiult point , he instantly difa

impart-ing to him the Emperor's final resolution,
conjured him not to fruffrate his endeavours for

seasonable obfitinacy on his fide, to difapypoint

Maw~ice delirous of an accommnodation.

Maurice , aotwithff tanding the prospe-rous

Stuation of his aff~airs, was firongly inclinbd
to listen tol his- advice. The Emperor, though
overreached and surprised, had now begun to
affermble troops, and however flow his motions
might be, while the first effeas of his coniter-
nation remained, he was fenfiible that Charles
adhi~ at last· aft with vigour proportional to the
extent of his power and territories, and lead
into GermanyT an armly formidable by its num-
bers, and ftiH more by the terror of his name,
as well as the remembrance of his past vi~tories.
He. coul2d fearccely hope that a confederacy comn-
pefed of fEo many members would continue to
operate with ifailcient union and pers~everance
to 13edi lk the. colnfiftent and well - dire~ted
efforts- of an army, at the- absolute disposal of a
leader accufomned to commnand and to conquer.
H~e felt already, alt~hough he h~ad not hitherto
experienced the iPhtock of any adverse event,
t~hat he was the head: of a disjointed body. H~le
lady, from. the exarmple; of Albert of Branden-

b:urgr, how- difficult it would be, with all his
address and credit, to prevent any particular
member fromn detaching himself from the whole,
and how impofi-Cble to recal him to his proper
rank and subordination. This fil~led him withi
apprehenflons for the common cause. Another
consideration gave him ·no less difquriet with re-
gard to his 0 wn particular interests. By setting
at liberty the degraded Ele~tor, and by repeal.
ing the at depriving him of his hereditary
honours and dominions, the Emperor had it in
his power to wound him in the most feniible
part. The effort~s of a Prince beloved by his
ancient faubjets , and revered by all the Pro-
teftant party, in order to recover what had been
unjuffly taken from him, could hardly have
failed of exciting commotions in Saxony, which
would endanger all that he had acquired at the
expence of so much diflimrulation and artifice.
It was no less in the Emperor's power to ren-
der vain all the; folicitations of the confederates
in behalf of the Landgrave. He had only to
add one a~t of violence more to the injuffice
and rigour with which he had already treated
him; and he had accordingly threatened th;6
ifons of that unfortunate Prince, that if they per-
sifted in their present enterprize , instead offeet·
ing their father reffored to liberty, they t~hould
hear of his having ~fiffered thle punifthment which
rebellion had merited. r)

Having deliberated upon all there points

with his a~ssociates, MVaurice thought it more
prudent to accept of the conditions off~ered ,
though less advantageous than those which he
had proposed , than again to commit all to the
doubtful issue of war. s) He repaired forth-
with to Pan~au, and signed (August 2. xr55"-)
the trea~ty of peace; of which the chief articles
were: That before the twelfth day of A~uguff,
the confederates iChall 1ay down their arms, and
disband their forces ; that on or before that
day the Landgrave ihall be. set at liberty, and
conveyed in s~afety to his castle of Rheinfels;
that a diet shall be held within fxx months, in
order to deliberate concerning: the most proper
and effe~ual nkiethod of prev~enting for the future
all. dis~putes and diffentions about religion; that,
in the mean time, neither the Emperor , nor
any other Prince, shall, upon any pretext what-
ever , offer any injury of violence to faxch as
adhered to the confefflon of Augsburg , but
allow them to enjoy the free and undiffurbed
exercise of their religion; that: in return, the
Protestants thall not molest the Catholicks either
in the exercise of their ecclefriftical jurifdi~tion,
or in perfdrming their religious ceremonies;
that the Imperial chamber shall adminiffer
juffice impartially to persons of both parties,

and Protestants be admitted indiferiminately
with the Catholicks to fit as judges in that
c~ourt; that if the next diet thould not be able
to terminate the difpuites with regard to reli-
gion, the flipulations in the present treaty in
behalf of the Protefiant~s, thall continue for ever
in full for~ce and vigour; that none of the con-
federatesffblall be liable to any at~ion on account
of what had happened during .the course of the
war; that the consideration of those encro~ach-
ment~s which hadl been made, as Maurice pre-
tended, upon the conflitution and liberties of
the Empire, i'hall be remitted ~to the approac-h-
ing diet; that Albert of Brandenburg thall b~e
comprehended in the treaty, provided he Chall
accede to it, and disband his forces before the

Such was the memorable treaty of Paffau·,

that: overturned the vast fabrick , in ere~2ing
which Charles had employed tEo many years,
and had exerted the utmost effo-rts of his power
and policy ; that annulled all his regulations
with regard to religion; defeated all his hopes
of rendering the Imperial authority absolute and

It is a fng~ular circumffance, that the. Reforma-

which had: formerly brought it to th% brink of

`by which he stattined them; and he was now
as utzhrerfM;Pjr-eiatolled for his zeal and publick
Spiri~t, as ha ·hiad lately been condemned for his

worthy of obs~ervation, that the French King,
a mnonarch zealous for the Catholick fatith,
thould employ his power in order to protest

Niaurice~ marches into Hungary ag~ainst the Turks.

As soon as the treaty of PafTau was signed
(Aug. 3. I552.) Maurice, in consequence of
his engagements with Ferdinand`, marched into
Hungary at the head of twenty thousand men.
But the vast superiority of the Turkis~h armies,
the fre~quent mutinies both of the Spanish and
German soldiers , occalloned by their want of
pay , together with the diffekntions between
M~aurice and Caftaldo, who was piqued at: being
obliged to resign the chief command to him,
prevented his performing any thing in that
country suitable to his~former fame, or of great
benefit to the King of the Romans. a)

Tlhe Landgrave of Hess~e recovers his liberty.

Wrhen Maurice s~et out for Hungary, the

Prince of Hesse parted from him wit~h the forces
-under his command, and marched back into his
own country, that he mig~ht be ready to receive
his father upon his return, and give up to him
the reins of government which he had held
during his abl~ence. But fortune was not yet
weary of persecuting the Landgrave. A bat-
talion of mercenary troops, which had been in
the pay of Hesse, being seduced by Reifenberg
their colonel, 'a soldier of fortune, ready to
engage in any .enterprize, secretly withdrew
from the young Prince as he was marching
home wards , and joined Albert of firandenburgh,
who still continued in arms against the Emp~e-
ror , refusing· to be included in the treaty of
Paffau. Unhappily for the Landgrave, ari ac-
count of this reached the Netherlands , just as
he was difrmiffed from the citadel of Mechlin
·where he had been confined, but before he had-
got beyond 'the frontiers of that country. The
Queen of Hungary, who governed there in her
brother's name, incensed at fazch an open vio-
lation of the treaty to which he owed his li-
bierty , commanded him to be arrefied , ~and
committed him again to the cuffody of the fame
SpaniCth captain who had guarded him for five
years with faxch severe vigilance. Philip beheld
all the horrors of his imprifonmnent renewed,
and his spirits fabfrding in the fame proportion

as they had risen during the thort interval in
which he had enjoyed liberty; he funk into
despair, and believed hims~elf to be doomed to
perpetual captivity. But the matter being ex-
plained ~to the Emperor's full fatisfaaion, that
the revolt of Rei~fenberg's mercenaries could be
imputed neither to the Landgrave nor to his
son, he gave orders for his release; and Philip
at last obtained the liberty for which he had to
long l~anguished. b) But though he recovered
his freedom, and was reinflated in his domi-
nions, his fufferings seem to have broken the
v-igour, and to have extirg~uifhed the aktivity
·of his mind. From being the boldest as well as
meft enterprising Prince in the Empire, he b~e-
came the most timid and cautious, and passed
the remainder of his days in a pacifick indo-
len c e.

Likewise the Eledor of Saxony.

The degraded Ele~-or of Saxony, likewise,

procured his liberty in consequence of the treaty
of Paffau. The Em~peror having been obliged
to relinquish all his schemes for extirpating the
Proteffant religion, had no longer any motive
for detaining him a pris~oner; and being extre-
mely sol~icitous, at that jun~ture, to recover
thdi confidence and good-will of the Germans,
whose a~iffan~ce was essential to the success of

the enterprize which he meditated against the
King of France, he, among other expedients
for that purpose, thought of releasing from im-
prifonment a Prince whose merit entitled him
no lesEs to effeem, than his fuff~erings .rendered
him the objeat of compailion. John Fred erick
tookt poffeiron accordingly of that part of his
territories w'hich had been reserved for him ,
when MIaurice was invefied with t~he Eledtoral
dignity. As in this situation, he continued to
display the fame virtuous magnanimity for which
he had been conspicuous in a more prosperous
and splendid slate , and which he had retained
amidst all his f~ufferings, he lived s~everal years
in that high reputation to which he had so just:
a title.

The Emperor resolves to make wHar uipon France.

The loss of M~ietz, Toul, and Verdun, had

made a deep impreffiorn on the Emperor. Ac-
cuftomed to terminate all his operations against
France with advantage to hims~elf, he thoug~ht
that it nearly concerned his h~onour not to allow
Henry the s~uperiority in this war , or to f~uffer
his own admini~t~ra~tion to be flained with the
infamy of having permitted territories of fach
consequence to be dismembered from the Em-
pire. This was no less a poipt of interest than
of honour. As the frontier of Champagne was
more -akre'd, and lay more exposed than that
of any province in France, he had fr~equently ,

roads upon it with great succes~s and effe~ts;
but if Henry were allowed to retain his late
conquei~s,' France would gain such a formi-
dable barrier on that fide, as to be altogether fe-
cure, where formerly the had been weakreft.
On the other ~hand, the Empire had now loft
as much, in point of security, as France had ac-
quired; and being itripped of the defence which
those cities afforded it, lay open to be invaded
on a quarter, where all the towns having been
-hitherto considered as interior, and remote
from any enemy, were but slightly fortified.
These considerations determined Charles to atL
tempt recovering the three towns of which
Henry had made hims~elf master; and the pre-
parations which he had made againit IVaurice
and his associates, enabled him to carry his re-
solution into immediate execution.

His preparations for this purpose.

As soon, then, as the peace was conclud-

ed at Pafflau, he left his inglorious retreat at
Villach, an d advanced to Auizgburg, at the
head of a considerable body of Germans which
hie had levied, together with all the troops
wvhich he had drawn out of Italy and Spain.
To there he added f'everal battalions, which
having~ been in the pay of the confederates ,
entered into his service wrhen dismissed by them;
~ad- he prevailed likewise on some Princes of

the Empire· to join him with their vassals. In
order to conceal the (destination of this formi-
dable army, and to guard against alarming the
French to ,as to put them on p~reparing for their
defence, he gave out: tha-t h~e was to march
forthwith into Hungary, in order ~to s~econd
IVlaurice in his operations against the Infidels.
W1hen he beg~an to advance towards the Rhine,
and could no longer employ that pretext, he
tried a new artifice, and. spread a report, that
he took this route in order to chafltife Alb~ert of
Brandenburgh, whol~e cruel exaltions in that part
of the *Empire called loudly for his interpolition
to check- them.,

The precautions of the French for the defence of Metz,

But the French having grown acquainted,

at last, with arts by which they had been to
often deceived, viewed all Charles's motions
with diffruff. Henry immediately dircerned
the true objeat of his vast preparations, and re -
s~olved to defend the important conquests which·
he had gained with vigour equal to that with
which they were about to be attacked.

The Duke of Guise appointed governobr of th~e town.

As he foref'aw that the whole weight of

the war would be turned against M/etz, by
whole fate that of Toul and Verdun would be
determined, he nominated Francis of Lorrain, ~Duke.

Duke of Guise , to take the command in that
city during the siege , the iifue of which would
equally asse&t. the honour and interest of his
country. His choice could not· have fallen upon
any person more worthy of that trust. The
Duke of Guise poffeffed, in a high degree, all
the talents of courage, f~agacit'y , and presenc~e
of mind, .which· render men eminent in military
command. He was largely endowed with that
magnanimity of foul which delights in bold en-
terprizes, and aspires to fame by splendid and
extraordinary a~tions. He repaired with joy
to the dangerous station affi'gned him as to a
theatre on which he might display his great
qualities under the immediate eye of his coun-
trymen, all ready to applaud him. The mar-
~tial genius of the French nobility in that age,
which considered it as the greatest reproach to
remain inaalive, when there was any oppor-
tunity of Elgnalizing their courage, - prompted
great numbers to follow a leader who was the
darling as well as the pattern of every one that
courted military fame. Several Princes of the
blood, many noblemen of the highest: rank-, and
all the young officers w~ho could obtain the
King's permillion, entered MVetz as volunteers.
By their presence they added spirit to the garrison,
and enabled the Duke of Guis~e to employ, on
every emergency, persons eager to diflinguifh
themf'elves, and fit to conduat any service.

Prepart·s for a vigorous defence.

But with whatever alacrity the Duke of

Guise und~ertook the defence of Metz, he found
everrthineg,· upion-his arr-ival there t in sauch a
fitiration ,.. *as might. have induced. anhy perfoni of
less intrepid coiurage~ to despair of defe~nding it
with fiuccef~s. The city was of great extent,
with large -faburbs; the walls were in many
places feeble and withouit ramparts; the ditch
harrow; :ahd the old towers-, which· projeated
infkead of baftionis, were at too great distance
fromn each other to defend the s~pace between
them. For· all there defe~ts he endea~vouredi to
provicde the -best remedy which the time would
permit, H;e ordered the suburbs , wriithout spar-
ing the moonafteries or churches, not even that:
of -St. Arnalph, in which several Kings of France
had been buried, to be levelled with the ground;
·but~ in order to guard against the imputation of
impi~ety, to which sauch a violation ~of so many
s~acred edifices, as well as of the athes of the
·dead, might ·expose him, he exeu~teYd this with
Tnuc~h religious ceremony. HKaving ordered all
'the holay vreffments -and utensils, together w~ith
the bones of the. Kings, and other persons de-
.posited in ther~e churches, to be removed, they
were carried in solemn proceiron to a church
withing the w~alls, he himself wvalking before
them uncovered, with a torch in ~his hand. He
then pulled down sauch hloues as fltood near the
walls, cleared and enlarged the ditch, repaired

the ruinous fortifications, and erefted new ones.
As it was necessary that all there works thould
be finis~hed with the utmost expedition, he la-
boured at them with his own hands : the of-
ficers and voluntees imitated his example , and
the s~oldiers submitted with cheerfulness to the
most severe fatigues, when they fawv that their
superiors did not decline to bear a part in there
together with them. At the ~a~me time he comp-
pelledd all useless peri~fos to ·leave the place; he
filled the magazines with proviflonms and mili-
tary fkores; burnt the mills, and d~eficoyed the
corn and forage for several miles round the
town. Such were his popular talents, as well
as his arts, of acquiring an ascendent over the
minds of men , that thle citizens s~econded him
with no les~s ardour than the s~oldiers; and ever~y
other pa~iron being s~wallowed up in the zeal to
repulse the enemy , with which he inspired
them, they beheld the ruin of ·their estates,
together with the havock which he made among
their publkck and private buildings, without
any emotion of refenmtment. c)

The chief comnmand , under the Emperor ,

was committed to the Duke of Alva, afiftted
by the Ibiarquis de M~acrignano, together with
the most experienced of the Italian and Spanish
generals. As it was towards the end of Oc-
tober, there intelligent off~icers reprefeated the
great danger of beginning, at such An advanc-ed
s~eason, a siege which could not fail to prove
very tedious. But Charles adhered to his own
opinion with his us~ual obstinacy, and being con-
sident that he had made s~uch preparations , and
taken such precautions, as would ensure sac-
cess, he ordered the city to be invested. As

vigour that ~he routeld them entirely, killed
many of the. effkcers, wounded eAmale himself,
and took him ·prisoner. Impmediately after this
viaory, he marched in triumph to Metz, and
joined his army to that of the Emperor. Char-
les, in reward for this service, and the great
accefflon of firength which he brought him ,
~granted Albert as formal pardon of all past of-
fences, and confirmed him in the poffeffl~on of
the territories which he had violently usurped
during the war. e)

The gallant behaviour of the Duke of Guise and his

g~arrison.

The Duke of Guis~e, though deeply affe~tedj

with his brother's misfortune, did not remit,,
"in any degree, the vigour wlith which he de-
fended the town. HIe harassed the besiegers
by frequent s~allies , in which his officers were
to eager to distinguish themselves , that his au-
thority being hardly f~uffici~ent to restrain the
impetuosity of their courage, he was obliged
at different times to ilhut th~e gates, and to con-
ceal the kreys, in' order to prevent the Princes
·of the blood, and noblemen of the first rank,
from exposing themselv~es to danger in every-
sally. He repaired in the night what the ene-

any's artillery had beat down during the day,
or erefted behind the ruined works new forti-
fications of almost equal firength. The Impe-
rialifts, ~on their part , pushed Rn the attack
with great f'pirit, and. carried forward, at once,
approaches- against different parts of the town.
But the art of attacking fortified places was not
then arrived at tha~t degree of perfeaion to
wKhich· it was carried to~wards the clos~e of the
iixteenth centuzry, during the long wa~r in the
Netherlands. The besiegers, after the unwea-
ried labout~ of many weeks, found that they
had made tbut little progress; and although their
batteries had made breaches in different places ,
they saw, to their aftonithment , works f~ud-
denly appear , in demolithing which their fa-
tigues and dangers would be renewed. The
Emperor , enraged at the obstinate resistance
which his army met with, left Thionville,
iwhere he had been confined by a violent fit of
the gout, a~nd though flill to infirm that he was
obliged to be carried in a litter , he repaired
(Nov. 26., x552.) to the camp; that, by his
pre fence , he might animate the fold ier ,
and urge on the attack with greater [pirit.
Upon his arrival, new batteries were ere~ted,
and new efforts were made with redoeblecf
ardour.

The diltrers of the imperial army.

iBut, by this time, the w~inter had set in

wtith g~reat rigo~ur; 'the camp was alternately
aeluged with crain 'or covered with ifnow; at the
-f'ame time proviilons were become extremely
fearce, as a body of Ftirench cavalry which ho-
vered in the neig~hbourhood, ofthn interruptedl
the convoys, or rendered their ai~rival difficult
anrd uncertain. Diseases began to sprea~d among
the soldiers, e'fpecially amnong lthe ILtal~ians and
Spaniards , unaccuffomed to' such inclemen't
weather; great numbers were~ difarbled f'rom
serving, an~d· many died. At length, fhichi
breaches were ma~de as seemed· pr-adicable, and
Charles refolved' to hazard a, general aifaslt, in
spite of all the remonfirances of his genera~ls
concerning the~ imprudence of atta~cking a nu-
merous g~arrifion, condukfed and animated byS
the most gallant of the French nobility , with
an army weakened by dis~eases, and dit~hear~tened
with il~l s~ucces~s. The Dukre of Guifie, futpea-~
ing the Emperor's intentions from the extraor-
dinary hurry which he observed in the enemy's
camp, ordered all his troops to their refpedtive
poffs. They appeared immediaitely on thei
walls, and behind the breaches, with faxch a
determined countena'nce, so eager? for the comn-
bat, and To well prepared to give the assailants
a warm reception, that the Imperialists, inficad
of advancing to the charge when the word of.
command was given, stood motionless in a

timid deje~ted silence. The Emperor, perceiv-
ing that he could not trust troops wrhole spirits
were t~o much Breokten, ret'ired abruptly to his
quarters, complaini-ng that he was now deserted
by his soldiers ,. who .des~erved no longer the
name of men. f)

The Emperor changes the method of attack.

Deeply as -this behaviour of his troops

mortified and affe~Sed. Charles , he would not
hear of abandoning the siege, though he saw
the necessity of changing the method of attack.,
He s~uspended the· fury of· his batteries , and
propofekd to proceed by the more secure but
tedious method .of sapping. But as it still
continued to rain or to snow almoff incessantl~y,
such as were employed in this s~ervice endured
incredible hardships: and the Duke of Guis~e ,
wkhof~e in~dultry was not inferior to his valour,
dificovering all their mines , counterworkred
them , and prevented their effe~t. At last ,
Charles finding it impomble to contend any
longer with the rigour of the fea~on , and with
enemies w~hom he could neither overpower by
force , not subdue by art . wrhile at the fiame
time a contagious distemper rag7ed among his
troops, and cut off daily great numbers of the
o~fficers as well as foaldiers , vielded to the
folicitations of his generals, who conjured him

Obliged to raise the flege.

UIion this , ( Dec. 26. r=52, ) he gave

orders immw~ediately to raise the siege, and fab-
mitted to the disgrace of abandoning the enter-
prise , after having continued fifty - ix days
before the town , during wrhich time he had
10ft upwards of thirty thousan~d men, who died
of diseas~es, or were killed by the enemy. The
Duke of Guile , as froon as he perceived the
intention of the Imperialists, tesok meafares to
prevent: their retiring unmlolefiedt,. and sent out
several bodies both of cavalry a~nd infantry to
infest their; rear, to pick up fkrargglers, and to
seize every opportunity of attacking them with
advantage. Such wars the confufiion with which
they made their retreat, that the French might!
have annoyed them in the most cruel manner.

Ruin of the Imperial army, and hulmanfity of the

French.

But when they sallied out, a £ipe~tacle pre-

fented itself to ~their view, which exltingulf~hed
at once all hostile rage, and melted them into
tenderness and compafflon. The Imperial camp
was filled with the sick and woulnded , with

the dead and the dying. In all the different
roads by which the army retired , numbers
were found , who having made an effort to
es~cape, beyond their strength, were left, when
they could go no farther, to perish without
assistance. This they received from their ene·
mies, and were indebted to' them for all the
kind offices which their friends had no0t the
power to perform. The Duke of Gulfe im-
~niediately ordered proper refreshments for such
as were dying of hunger; he appointed surgeons
tto attend the sick and wounded; he removed
·such as could bear it into the adjacent villages;
and- thos~e who would have fuffered by being
carried to far, he admitted into the hos~pitals
which he had fitted up in the city for his own
fobldiers. .As soon as they recovered, he sent
·them home under an escort of soldiers , and
with money to ~bear their charges. By thiere
a~ts of humanity , which were uncommon in
that age , when war was carried on with
greater rancour and ferocity than at present ,
the Duke of Guise completed the fame which
he had acquired by his gallant and f~uccef~sful
defence of 1Metz, and engaged those wihom he
had vanquished to vie with his own countrymen
in extolling his name. g)

S·' pad S tulation of the. EmYperor's affairs in Italy.

To~ th~ese calamities in Germany , were

4ddq~d fuclh unfotrtunate events. in Italy , as
rendered this the; most difafitous year in the
Emperor's life.. Du;ring his refidene at Villach,
Charles had applied to Cofmno di Medici for the
loan of two huindred, thousa~nd crowns. But his
ctre~dit at thalt time wa~s t~o low, that in order
ta. obtain this inlconfiderable slum , he was
obliged to put him .in poffeflion of the principa-
lity of Piombino, and by giving .up that, he
loft the footing which he had hithert~o maintain-
ed in Tufeany, and enabled Cosmo to assume,
oyr thq future, ·the tone and deport~ment of a
Prirscy altogether independent. Much about
the time that his, indigence coanfirined AfiER to
part wi-th this valuable territory, he loft Siena,
which was of still greater consequence, through
the -ill; conduft of Don Dieg$o de Mendoza. h)

The revolt of Siega.

Siena , like most of the great: cities in

Italy, had long enjoyed a republican govern-
ment , under the prote~tion of the Empire;
but being torn in pieces by the diffentioqps
between the nobility and the people , which
divided all the Italian cormmonwealths , the

fadtion of the people, which gained the afcen-
dant , besought the Emperor to become the
guardian of the adminiffration which they had
establish~ed-, and admitted into their city a
small body of Spanish soldiers, whom he had
sent to cauntenance the execution of the lawrs,
and to preserve tranquillity among them. The
direc~ion of the'fe troops was given to Men-
doza, at that time ambassador for the Emperor
at Rome, who persuaded the credulous muslti-
tude, that it was neceffarty for their security
against any future attempt of the nobles, to
allow him to build a citadel in Siena; and as
he flattered himself that by means of this fort-
reft he might render the Emperor master of
the city , he pushed on the works with all
possible dispatch. But he threw off the malrk
too soon. Before the fortifications were com-
pleted, he began to indulge his natural haughti-
ness and severity of temper, and to treat the
citizens with great ins~olence. At the fame time
the soldiers in garris~on being paid as irre,
gularly as the Emperor's troops us~ually were,
lived almnoft at diferetion upon the inhabitants,
and were guilty of many a~ts of licence and
op pr ellion.

The Sienefe court the airiftance of France.

These injuries awakened the Siene-fe to a

sense of their danger. As they saw the nefefH-

tyr: of: exerting themselv~es, iwhile the unfinished
foi-tificationsr of the citylel left them any hopes
f f~uncerfs , ·they apiplied ta the Frenceh ambaffa-
dor -ati R~ome, who readily · promised them ~his
inafterfk prot~eftion- sad aifianc-e. At the fame
time, forgetting -their downefti~ck animnofities
when foch 'a mortal blow was aimed at the li-
ber~ty and ~existence of the republick, they sent
agents to the exiled nobles, an~d inv~ited them
to concur with theml in sa~ving their country
from the servitude wiith which it was threatened.
ASs t~er~e was not a momaent to lose , meafares
were; concerted fpe~edly, but wi'th great pru-
dEence; arnd were ex~ecuted with equal vigour.
The citizens role ruddenly in -arms; the exiles
flocked into the town ~fromn different parts with
all their partisan~s, and what tr~oops they could
draw ·togehe~r; and seve~ral bodies of m~ercena-
rie~s in ·th pay of Fr~nice appeared to s~upport
them. The Slpaniards, th-ough s~urprised, and
su~nch inferior in num~ber, defendeid themnfelves
wiJth great courage; but fein~jg no profpe~t of
.relief, a~nd having no hopes of mainta~ining their
fAution long in a ·hailf-fin~ifhed fortres~s, they
foun gave it up. Th~e ·Sienefe, with the ut-
most alacrity , levelled it with the ground, that
no monument might remain of that odious fkruc-
ture, wh~ich had been raised in order to enslave
them. At the fame time renouncing all con-
nexiori wkith the Em eror, they sent ambassadors
to thf-ank the -Kinrg of Fran-ce as .the restorer of

their liberty, and to entreat that he would fe-
cure to them the perpetual enjoyment of that
blefirng, by continuing his prote~ion to the~ir
republick. 'i)

Dekent of the Turks in the ksingdom of Naples.

;To there tnisfortunes, one filll more fatal

hadi almost fithseeded. The severe adminiftra.
;t~in of Don Pedre de Toledo, viceroy of lia-
ples, having filled that kingdomn with murmur-
in~g and· difaffe~tion, the Prince of Salerno, the
hea~d of the maalecon~tents, had fled to the court
of France, wlhere all who bore ill-will to the
Emperor or his miniffers, where fare of finding
proteaion and afirftance. That nobleman, in
the usu~al flyle of exiles, bonfling much of his
partifagns, and of his great influence with them,
prevailed on Henry to th-ink of invading Naples,
from expe~tation of being joined by all those
. with whom ~the Prince of Salerno hleld corre-
fpondence, or who were diffatisfied with Tole-
dcio's government. But though the first hint of
this enterpris7e was fuggefied by the Prince of
Salerno, Henry did not choose that its success
trhould e~ntirely depe~nd upon his being able to
fSulfil th~e pro~mises which he had mnade. He ap-

ficult to· obtain what he requefied of the Sultan,
who, at this time, was highly incenred ag~ain~st
the house of Auffria, on accotent ;of the pro-
;ceedings-in H~ungary. HIe r rdegred~ an~ hun~dred

As the French had never given to s~evere a

check to the Emperor in any former campaign.
they exprefekd immoderate joy at the foccefs of
their arms. Charles hims~elf, accuffomed to a
long series of prof'perity, felt the blow most
~se~nsibly, and retired from M~etz into the Low
Co~untries, much deje~ted with the cruel re-
verse of fort~une which affe~ted him in his de-
clining· age , when the violence of the gorit had
increased to faxch a pitch, as entirely broke
the vigour of his constitution, and rendered
him peevis~h , difficult of access , and often in-
c~apable of applying to business. But whenever
he enjoyed any interval of ease, all his thoughts
were bent on revenge, and he deliberated, with
the utmeft solicitude , concerning the most pto-
per means of annoying France , and of effacing
the Rain which had obfrcured the reputation
and glory of his strms. All the schemes coib-
serning G~ernany p, which had engroied him s~o
long , being dif'concerted by the peace of Paffau,
the affairs of the Empire became only f'econdaryg
obje~ts of attention; and enmity to France was
the predominant patlion which chiefly occupied
his mind.

Th~e violent proceedings of Albert of Brandenburg.

TIhe turbulent ambition of Albert of Br'at-

denburg excited violent commotions , which dif-

Hist. of C=harl. V. V ol. IV7. I

turbed thle Emipire during this year. That
Prince's troops having Chared in the calamities
of the sieg~e of ~etz, were greatly reduced in num-
ber. But the Emperor, prompted by gratitude
for his distinguished s~ervices on that occasio~n,
or herhaps with a secret view of fomenting di-
visions among the Princes of the Empire, hav-
ing paid up all1 the money due to him, he was
enabled with that fuxm to hire so many of the
soldiers dismissed from the Imperial army, that
he was soon at thle head of a body of men as
numerous as ever. The bishops of Bamberg
and TWurtzburg having f'olicited the Imperial
chamber , to annu , by its authority, the
iniquitous conditions which Albert had comp-
pelledd them to sign , that court unanimously
found all their engagemnents with him to be
void in their own nature, because they had
been extorted by force; enjoined Albert to re-
nounce all claim to the performance of them;
'and, if he t~hould persist in fach an unjust de-
mand, exhorted all the Princes of the Empire
to take .arms against him as a diflurber of the
publick tranquillity. To this decision, Albert-
oppofied the confirmation of his tranfa~tions with
the two prelates, which the Emperor had grant-
ed him as the reward of his having joined the
Imperial army at Mletz: and in order to inti-
midate his antagonists, as well as to convince
them of his refol~ation not to relinquish his pre-
teniions, he put his troops in motion, that he

might secure the territory in queffion. Various
endeavours were employed, and many expe-
dients proposed, in order to prevent the kindl-
ing' a new war in Germany. But the fame
warmth of temper which rendered Albert tur-
bulent and enterprizing, inspiring him with the
most franguine hopes of fu~cce~s , even in his
wildest undertakings, he dif'dainfully rejeated
all reas~onable overtures of accommodation.

He is condemned by the Imy~erial chamnber.

Upon this , the Imperial chamber iirued its

decree against him, and required the Eledtor of
Saxony , together with several other Princes
mentioned by name, to take arms in order to
carry it into execution. Maurice, and those
associated with him, were not unwilling to un-
dertake this service. They were extremely [.0-
ficitous to maintain publick order by s~upporting
the authority of the Imperial chamber , and saw
the necefirty of giving a timely check to the
ufurpations of an ambitious Prince, who had no
principle of ac~ion~ but regard to his own inter-
eft, and no motive to diredt him but the im-
pulse of ungovernable paflions. They had good
reason to f~ulpedt, that the Emnperor encouraged
Albert in his extravagant and irregular proceed-
ings, and f'ecretly afforded him afiffAance, that,
by raiing him up to rival Maurice in power, he
might, in any future broil, make use of his
affifiance to counterbalance and control the auL

A confederacy formed ag-ainftc himn, of which Maurice was

Thiere considerations united the most power-

ful princes in Germany in a league againff Al-
bert, of which IV~taurice was declared (Alpri~l 2.
I553'.) generalissimo. This formidable confe-
deracy, however, wrought no change in Albert's
sentiments; b ut as· he; kinew thtt: he could not:
resist: to many Princes, if he thould allow them
time~ to ailistrnbl'e their forces , he endeavoured,
by his affivrity, to deprive them of all the ad-
vantages which they might d'erive from their
unmited power anid niumbers; and for that reason
marched direftly against IVaurice, the enemy
whiom he dreaded moss. %t was happy for the
alfles that the coindu~t of thieir affairs was com-
mitted to a Prince of such ab~il'ities. He, by
hiis aiuthority and example, had inspired them
wi'th vigour; and having carried on their pre-
parations with a degree of rapidity, of which
conf'edersite bodies are seldom capable, he was
in condition to face Albert: before he could make
any conf~id'erable progreirs.

Of all the pers~onages who have zlppeared

in the hiffory of this a~tive age, when great
occurrences , and fixdden revolutions , called
forth extraordinary talents to view, and afforded
them full opportunity to display themselves ,
Mlaurice may juffly be considered as the moit
remarkable. If 'his exorbitant ambition , his
profound idiflimultion , and his unwarrantable
us~urpation of his kinfmnan's honours and domi-
nions , exclude him from being praised as a
virtuous- man ; his prudence in concerting his
measures , his vigour in executing them, and
the uniform~ succe~ss with which they were at,
tended , entitle him to the appellation of a
great Prince. At an age , when impetuofity'
of spirit commonly predominates over political
wisdom , when the higheit effort even of a
genius of the firit order is to fix on a bold
feheme, and to execute it: with promptitude
and courage, he formed and condua~ed ant intd-c
cate plan of policy, which deceived the molt
artful Mlonarch in Europe. At the very junc-
ture when the Emperor had attained to almost
unlimited deipo'tifin , Maurice , with power

feceminglTy inadequate to fulch an undertaking ,
colmpelled him to relinquish all his ufurpations,
and eflablifhled not only the religious but civil
liberties of Germany on faoch foundations as
have hitherto remained unfbaken. Althou h,
at one period of his life, his condu&t excited
the jealouf'y of the Proteffants , and at another,
drew on him thte refentmnent of the R~oman
Catholicks, fach was his masterly address, that
he was the enly Prince of" the age who, in any
degree, poffeff~ed the confidence of both, and
whom both lamented as the mnoft able as well
as faithful guardian of the, confititution and laws
of his country.

Albert continues the w~ar.

The consternation which Mau~rice's death

occafloned among his troops, prevented them
from makting the proper improvement of the
viaory which they had gained. Albert, whose
affive courage, and profuse liberality, rendered
him the darling of such military adventurers as
were little folicitons about the juffice of his
cause, soon reassembled his broken forces, and
made fresh levies with fach faccefs , that he
was quickly at: the head of fifteen thousand
men , and renewed his depredations wtith ad-
ditional fury. But Henry of Brunf~wicki having
taken the command of the allied troops , de-
seated him (Sept. 12. x553.) in a fCecond battle,
fe~arcely less bloody than the former. Even then

bis courage did not fink, nor were his resources
exhaufked.

He is driven out of Germany.

He made s~everal efforts, and some . of them

very vigorous , to retrieve his affairs ; but
being laid under the ban of the Empire by the
Intperial chamber; being driven by degrees out
of all his hereditary territiories, as wrell as
those which he had usurped ; being foriaken by
many of his off~icers , and overpowered by the
number of his enemies , he fled for refuge into
Fran~ce. After having been, for a considerable
time, the terror and scourge of Germa~ny, he
lingered out some years in an indigent and de-
pendent state of exile, the mireries of which
his reftlets and arrogant [pirit endured with
the meft indignant impatience. UTpnn his death
(January Is. 1557.) without iffee, his territ
tories, which had been seized by the Pricees
who tookr arms against him, were reftered , by
a decree of the Emperor , to his collateral
keirs of the hous~e of Brandenburg. n)

his grandfather's name, and inherited the great
talents for which he was conspicuous, a violent
dispute arose concerning the fuccefflon to his
honours and territories. John Frederick , the
degraded ele £}or, claim ed the elefforal dignity,
and that part of his patrimonial effate of which
he had been violently stripped after the Smalkal-
dick war. Auguffus, Maurrice's only brother,
pleaded his right not on} y to the hereditary
poffeffions of their family , but to the eleftoral
dignity, and to the territories which MVaurice
had acquired. As Auguflus was a Prince of
considerab~le abilities, -as well as of great can-
dlour and gentleness of manners, the states of
Saxony , forgetting the merits and fufferings
of their formner master, declared wrarmly in his
favour. His pretenfrons were powerfully sup-
ported by the King of Denmark, w~hole daughter
he had married, and zealously efpoured by the
King of the Romans, out of regard to M~an-
rice's memory. T"he degraded Ele~tor, though
kecretty favoured byS his ancient enemy the Em-
peror , was at las} ob:~ged to relinquirh his
claim , upon obtaining a (mall addition to the
territor~ies w~hich h-ad been allotted to him ,
together wlith a flipulation , securing to his
famnily the eventual A~ccef-on , upon a failure
of male heirs in the Albertine I~ne. That un-
fo~rtunate, but magnanimous Prince, died next
y5ear, soon after ratifying this treaty of agree-

anent; and the ele~loral dignity is still poffef~e~d

Hokil·ities in the Low Countries.

During there tranf~a~ions in Germany, war

was carried on in the Low Countries with con-
fiderable vigour. The Emperor, i~mpatient to
.eiface the slain which his ignominious repulse
·at Mnetz left upon his military reputation, had.
an army early in the field, and laid siege to
Tierouane. Though the town was of such imp-
portance,, that Francis used to call it on~e of the
two pillows on which a King of France might
sleep with security , the fortifications were in
disrepair: Henry, trussing to what had happen-
ed at M~etz, thought nothing mor~e was necef-
fary to render all the efforts of the enemy
abortive, than to reinforce the garrison with a
considerable number of the young nobility. But
d'Effi~, a veteran officer who commanded them,
being killed, and the Imperialists pus~hing the
fiegee with great vigour and perseverance, the
place was taken ( June a x. I553.) by assault.
That it might not: fall again into the hands of
the French, Charles ordered not only the for-
tifications but the town to be ratied, and the
inhabitants to be dispersed in the adjacent:
cities. Elated with this fuzccefs, the Imperi~al-
ifts immediartely invested Hefdin, which, though

defended with great bravery , was likewise
taken by assault, and such of the garrison as
escaped the iiword were made prisoners. The
Emperor entrafted the conduft of this siege to
Emnanuel Philibert of Savoy , Prince of Pied-
mont, who, on that occasion, gave the first
display of those great talents for military com-
exand , which soon entitled him to be ranked
among the first generals of the age, and faci-
litated his re - establishment in his hereditary
dominions, the greater part of which having
been, over-run by Francis in: his expeditions
into Italy , wrere still occupied by Henry. p)

The loss of there towins, together with io

many persons of diftin~tion , either killed or
taken by the enemy, was no inconsi~derable cala-
mity to France , and Henry felt it very fenfi-
bly; but he was ftilil more mortified at the Em-
peror's having aill'ured his wonted superiority
in the field t~o soon afrter the blow at 1Hletz ,
which the French had represented as fatal to
his power. He was ashamed, too, of his own
remifliuefs anid ex~cei~ve security at the opening
of the campaign; and, in order to repair that
error, he assembled a numerous army, and led
it into the Lowr Countries.

Roused at the approach of fach a formi-

dable enemy, Charl~es left Bruf~eis , where he
had been shut up t'o closely during seven months,
that it came to be believed in many parts of
Europe that he was dead; and though he was
to, much debilitated by the goat that he could
hardly bear the motion of a litter, he hajiened
to join his army. The eyes of all Europe were
turned with expe~tation towards those mighty
and exasperated rivals, between whom a deci-
'five battle was now thought unavoidable. But
Charles having prudently declined to hazard a
general engagement, and the violence of the
autumnal rains rendering it impofi~ble fbr the
French to undertake any siege, they retired,
without having performed any thing fauitable
to the great preparations which they had
mpade. q)

The Imperialist~s unfuccefsfuil in Italy,

The Imperial arms did not make the fame

progres~s in Italy. The narrowners of the Em-
pero'Os finances seldom allowed him to a& with
vigour in two different places at the fa~me time;
and having exerted himself to the utmost in
order to make a great effort in the Low Coun-
tries, his operations on the other fide of the
Alps were proportionally feeble. The viceroy
of Naples, in conjunetion with Cosmo3 di Miedici,

who was greatly alarmed at the intr~odu~tion
of French troops into Siena·, endeavoured to
become master of that city. But, inficad of
reducing the Sienefe ., the Imp~eriaift~s were
obliged to retire a~bruptly, in order to defend
their owvn country, upon the appe-arance of the
Turkish fleet , w~hich treatened the coast of
Naples ; and the French not only effablifhed
themselves more firmly in Tuscany , aut, by
the assistance of' the Turkis,_ conquered a grea-t
part of the island of Coriica , fubje~t, at that
time to the Genoes~e. r)

and in Hungary,

The affairs of the house of Auffria declined

no lef's in Hungary during the course of this
·year. As the troops which Ferdinand krept in
Transylvania received their pay very irregularly,
they lived almost at difecretiono upon the in-
habitants; and their insolence and rapacious~ne~ss
greatly difg·ufed all rankrs of men , and alienat-
ed them from their new f~orere~ign, who, initead
of protedting , lundered his fabje~ts. Their
indig~nation at this , added to their desire of
revengingr Mfartinuzzi's death, w~rought t~o much
upon a turbulent nobility, impatient of injury,
and upon a fierce people , prone to change ,
that they were ripe for a revolt. At that very
jun·~ture, their late Queen Isabella , together

r) Thuan. 417.

with her son, appeared in Tranfilvania. Her
ambit~ious mind couldi not bear the forlitude
and ina~tivity of a private life; and repen tin g
quickly of the cefr~on which the had made of the
crown in the year one thonfand five hundred
and fifty-one, she left the place of her retreat,
hoping that the diffatisfa~ion of the Hungari-
ans withi the Aufkrian go vernment would prompt
them once more to recognise her fon's right to
the crown. Some noblemen of great eminence
declared immediately in his favour.

Ferdinand obliged to abandon Tranf'ylvania.

The Bafha of Belgrade, by Solyman's order,

ef~ponf~ed his caufek, in opposition to Ferdin~and;
the Spanish and German soldiers , instead of
advancing against the enemy , mutinied for·
.want of pay, declaring that they would' march
back to Vienna ; so that Caftaldo, their general,
was obliged to abandon Transyl]vania to Ifa-
bella and the Turks, and to place himself at
the head of the mutineers, that by his atutho-
rity he might restrain them from plundering
the Auffrian territories , through which they
passed. s)

Solyman's dorneftiek diffrelfes.

Ferdinand's attention was turned so entirely

towards the affairs of Germany, and his trealares

s> nbuan. 430.

so much exhauffed by his late efforts in Hun-
gary, that he made no attempt to recover this
valuable province, although a favourable oppor-
tunity for that purpose prefeated itself , as Soc
lyman was then engaged in a war with Pediia,
and involved besides in domeftick calamities
which engrossed and diflurbed his mind. Soly-
man, though distinguished by many accomplis~h-
ments from the other Ottoman Princes, had
all the pafflons peculiar to that violent and
haughty race. He was jealous of his authori-
ty, fadden as well as furious in his anger,
and s~usceptible of all that rage of love , which
reigns in the East, and often produced the
wildest and moss tragical effects.

The tragical billory of hiis lon Mlufapha.

His ~favourite miffrers wtas a CircafiTan f'lave

of exquisite beauty, who bore him a son called
MVuffapha , whom, both on account of his birth-
right and merit, he deffined to be the heir of
his crown. Roxalana, a Raiian captive, soon
supplanted the Circassian , and gained the Sul-
tan's heart. Having the address to retain thle
conquest which tfhe had made, she kept posses-
sion of his love without any rival for many
years, during whbich thle brought him s~everal
sons and one daughter. All the happiness,
however, which t'he derived fr~om the unbound-
ed s~way that t~he had acquired over a monarch
whom one half of the w-orld revered or dreaded

was emnbittered by perpetu~al, reflexions on Mur-
tapha's accellion to the throne, and the cer-
tairi death of her sons , who, the foresaw,
would be immediately sacrificed, according to
the barbarous jealo-ury of Turkish policy , to
the safety of the new Emperor. By dwellinlg
continually on this melancholy idea, the came
gradually to view M~uflapha as the enemy of her
children, and to ihate him with more thanl a
fkepmother's ill - will. This prompted her to
wit'h his deitrudtion, in order to secure for one·
of her own f'ons the throne which was deft'ined
for him. Nor did the want either ambition to
attempt fach a high enterprise , or the arts re-
quiiite for carrying it into execution. Having
prevailed on the Sultan to give her only daugh-
ter in marriage to Ruff-an the Grand Vizier,
the difelofed her s~cheme to that crafty miniff er ,
who perceiving that it was his own interest to
co-operat~e with her, readilyr promised his allis-
ance towards aggrandizing that branch of the
royal line to which he was so nearly allied.

As f'oon as Roxalana had concerted her

meafuires with this able confident, The began
to affLe&t a wonder~ful zeal for the MNahometan
religion, to which Solyman was fuperfttitiufl
attached, and proposed to found and endow a
royal mos~que, a worki of great extpence, but
deemed by the Turks meritorious in the high-
eft degree. The Mufti whom tChe consulted,
approved muchi of her pious intention; but, hav-

ing~

ing been gained and infirudetd by Ruffan, told
her, that the being a slave could, derive no be-
nefit hers~elf from that hol-y deed, for aUl the!
mnerit of it would accrue to Solyman , the maf-
ter ;whose property the wias. Upon this thie
seemed to be overwhelmed with sorrow, and to
fink into the deepest mnelancholy , as, if fbhe had
been difg~uffed with life and all its enjoyment.
Solyman, who was abs~ent w7ith the army, being
informed of this deje~tion of mind, and of the
endfe from w~hich it proce~eded , dircovered all
the solicitude of a lover to remove it, and by
a writing under his hand declared her a free
wtoman. Roxalana having gained this point,
proceeded to build the Mosque, and re-affsmed
her udual gaiety of [pirit. But when Solyman,
on9 his return to Constantinople , feet a eunuch,
according- to th~e custom of the feragic, to bring
her to partakre of his bed , t~he, seemingly with
deep regret, but in the most peremptoryT man-
ner, declined to follow the eu~nu-ch, declaring
tha~t what had been an honour to her while a
flalve, became a crime as the was now a fr·ee
woman, and that t~he would not involve either
the Sultan or herf'elf in the guilt that must be
contrasted by fach an open violation of the la w
of their prophet. Solyman, whose pai;R·n this
difficulty, as well as the affected delicac~y which
gave rif~e to it, heightened and inflamed , had
recourse immediately to the Mufti for his dir~ec-
tion. He replied, agreeably to'the Koran, th-at

Hii1. of C~harl. V. Vol. IV. K

Roxalana's femuples were well founded; but add-
ed , artfully, in word~s which Ruft-an had taught
him to ure, that it was in trhe Sultan's power
to remove· there difteaulties, by espousing her as
his lawful .wife. -Th~e amorous mionarch closed
eag~erly with 'th'e propefal, anld solemnly mari
ried her, .according to the form of the ~Maho-
.metan ritual; though , by doing s~o, he difte-
garded a maxim of policy which the pride of
the Ottoman blood had taught all the Sultans
iince Bajazet I. -to confider as inviolable. From
his time, none' of the Turkiifh mronarchs had
married, because-, when he was' vlanquif~hed and
taken prisoner by Tamerlane, his wife had been
abut~ed· with barbarous insolence· by the Tartars.
That no flmilar calamity might f~ubje& the Ot-
tomaan family to the like difgtace, the Sultans
admitted none to their bed but slaves, whole
dishonour could not bring any fanch stain upon
their hodie.

But the more uncommon the itep was, the

more it convinced Roxalana , of the unbounded
infl~uence which the had acquired over the Sul-
tan's heart; an~d emboldened her to prosecute,
with greater hope of fauccefs, the scheme that
the had formed in· order to destroy M~uftapha.
This young Prince having been entruffed by
his father, according to the pradtice of the Sul-
tans in that ag~e , with the g-overnlment of fe-
veral different provinces, was at: that time in-
vefied with the adminiffration in' Diarbequir,

the ancient Mlefopotamia, which Solyman had
wreflted fr~om the Persians, and added to his
empire. In all ther'e different commands, Mluf~-
tapha had condui~ted himself with. fach cautious
prudence as could give no offence to his fa-
ther, though, at the fame time, he governed
with so much moderation as well as juffice, and
displayed fach valour and generosity, as ren-
dered him eqlually the favourite of the people
and the darling of the soldiery.

There was no room to lay any folly or

vice to his charge, that could impair the high
opinion which his father entertained of him.
Roxalana's malevolence was more refined; t~he
turned his virtues against him, and made use
of ther~e as engines fqr his deftruation. She of-
ten mentioned, in Solyman's presence , the
s~plendid qualities of his s~on; the celebrated
his courage, his liberality, his popular arts,
with malicious and exaggeitated praise. As
soon as thle perceived that the Sultan heard
thes~e encomiums, which were often repeated,
with uneasiness ;' *that f~ul~picion of his son
began to mingle itself with his former effeem;
and that by degrees he came to view him
with jealousy· and fear; t~he introduced, as
by accident, some dis~course concerning the re-
bellion of his father Selimn agrainft Bajaze~t his
grandfather: the took notice of the bravery of
the veteran troops under M'ultapha's command,
and of the n-eig~hbourhood of Diarbequir to the ter--

ritorieds of the Perlian Sophi, Solyman's mortal
enemy. By: thiefbc arts, whatever remained of
paternal tenmderners was entirely extinguiithed,
and' fach pafflon~s were kindled ill the breast of
the Sultan, aS gave all Roxalana's malignant
sug~gestio~ns the co~lour not only ·of probability
but of truth. A deep-rooted hatred faucceed~ed,
now, to his fulpicions an~d fear of' Irufapha.
Hie appointed spies to· observe and report all his
words and adtions; he wa~Ltched and stoo~d on
his guard againfti him as his tnoft dangerous
enemy.,

Having thus alienated the 5ultan's heart

from Mattapha, Roxalana ventered upon another
~flp. Sh'e en~trearted Solymadn to allow her own
fonis the liberty of appearing at court, hoping
that by gaining accetfs to their father , they
might, by their good qualities and dutiful de-
portment, infinoate thems~elves into that place
in his affe~ions which Muftapha had formerly
held; and , thorugh what the demanded was
·contrary to the praaice of th~e Ottoman family
in that age*, the e xiorious linonar~ch granted her
r~eiquft. To sli therfe female intrigues Ruffan
a~dded an artitfice ft'ill more t;hbtle, which com-
pleted the Sultan's delations, and heightened
his jea-loury· andk far. He Wrote to the Barnawis
of the provinces· adjacent to Dia~rbequir, in-
firu&-thg -them to fend him regular intellige~nce
of IV4nflapha's proceedings in his government ,
and to each of them he gave a private hint,

flowing in appearance from: his zeal for their
interest, that nothing would be more acceptable
to the Sul-tan than tol receive favrourable ac-
counts oi' a Con whom he destined to faitain the
glory of the Ottoman name. The Bathaws
ignorant of his franudulent in tention, and eager-
to pay court to their s~overeig-n at fach an easy
p~rice, fil.!ed their letters with fludied but fatal
paniegyricks of Muff apha , representing him as
a Prince worthy to faucceed s~uch an ifllulrious
father , and as endowed with talents which
might. enable him to emulate, perhaps to equal
his fame. There letters were industriously
thewtn to Solyman, at the seasons when it was
known that they would make the deepest im-
pretiron. Every exprefilon in recommendation
of his s~on wounded him to the heart; he sus-
pe~ted his principal officers of being ready to
favour the most derperate attempts of a Prince
whom they were To fond to pratife; and Fancy-
ing that he s~aw them already assaulting his
t~hrone with rebellious arms, he determined,
-while. it was yet in his power, to anticipate
the blow , and to s~ecu~re his own safety by his
fon's death.

For this purpore, though under pretence

of renewing the war against Persia, he ordered
Ruitan to march towards Diarbequir at the head
of a numerous army, and to rid him of' a son
w~hos~e life he deemed inconfiffent with his own
s~afety. Buzt that crafty miniffer did not choofet

to be loaded with' the odium of h~aving executed
this cruel order. As s~oon as he arrived in Syria
he wrote to Solyrnan, that the danger was t~o
Imminent as cazll'ed for his immediate pres~ence ,
that the camp ·was full of Muffapha's emiff'aries;
that fnany of the soldiers were corrupted·; that
the affe~tiozrs of all leaned towalrds him; that
he had discovered a biegociation Iwhich had been
carried on with thC Sophi of Perfra in or-der to
marry Maftapha with one of his daughters; that
he already felt his own talents as well as au-
thority to be inadequate to the exigencies of
foch an arduous conjunature; that the Sultan
alone had sagacity to discern what resolution
tihould be taken -in those circumff~ances, and
pow~er to carry that resolution ~into exe-
cution.,

This charge of courting the friends~hip of

-the Sophi, Roxalana and Ruffan had reserved
as the last and mott envenomred of all their ca-
lumnies. It operated with the violence which
they expe~ted from Solvinan's inveterate ab-
bhorrence of the Persians , and threw~ him into the
wildest transports of rage. He set out instantly
for Syria, and hast~ened thither with all the
precipitation and impatience of fear and revenge.
As soon as he joined his army near Aleppo,
and had concerted measures with Ruftan, he
f'ent a Chiaus , or me~2enger of the court, to
his son, requiring him to repair immediately to
his presence. I~uitapha, though no firanger

to his Rtep-mother's machinations, or to Ruf-
tan's malice, or to his father's violent temper,
yret rely ing on his own innocence, and hoping
to discredit the accusations of his enemies by
the promptitude of his obedience, followed the
messenger without delay to Aleppo. The mo-
ment he arrivred in the camp , he was inrtroduced
into the Sultan's tent. As he entered it, he
observed nothing that could give him any alarm;
-no additional crowd of attendants, no body of
armed guards, but the fame order and silence
which always reign in the Sultan's apartments.
In a few minutes, however, s~everal mutes ap-
peared, at the fight of whom MRniapha, know-
ing what was his doom, cried with a loud voice,
,, Lo, my death! " and attempted to fly. The
mutes rushed forward to s~eize him; he refiftled
and struggled, demanding with th'e utmeft ear-
neftners to fee the Sultan; and derpair, together
with the hope of finding protec~ion from the
soldiers, if he could escape out of the tent,
animated him with such extraordinary firength,
that for some time, he baffled all the efforts of
the executioners. Solyman was within hearing
of his fon's cries, - as well as of the noise which
the struggle occasioned. Impatient of this delay
of his revenge, apd fkruck with terror at the
thoughts of Muffapha's escaping, he drew aside
the curtain which divided the tent, and thrust-
ing in his head , darted a fierce look towards
the mutes , and, with wild and threatening

g~etures , see-med to chide them for sloth andl
timidity. At fight of his fafther's furious and
unrelenting countenance, IMuitapha's fireng~th
failed, and his courage forsook him; the mutes
fastened the bow-string about his neck, and in
a moment put -an -end to his life.

The dead body was exposed· before the! Sul-

tan's tent. The soldiers gathered round it, and
contemplating that mournful' objeat with affoi
nifbhment , and sorrow , and indignation , were
ready, if a. leader had no~t been wanting,. to
haveg broake out into the wildest excesses of rage.·
After giving vent to the first expr~efflons of their
grief , they retired each man to his tent, and
fbutting themselves up, bewailed in secret th-e
crulel faEte of their favourite; nor was there one
of themn who tasted so~d, or even water, dur-
ing the remainder of that day. . Next morning
the time follitude and silence reigned in the
camp; and Solyman, being afraid that some
dreatful faorm would follow this sullen calm,
in order to appease the enraged soldiers, de-
prtrved Rultan of the seals , ordered him to leave
the camp, and raised Achmet, a gallant officer
much beloved in the army, to the dign~ity of
Vifier. This change , however, was made in
concert with Ruffan himself; that crafty minis-
ter suggesting ·it as the only expedient which
could save h-imself or his master. But within a
few months, when the refentrnent of the Ifol-
diers began to fulbfide, and the name of Muf-

tapha to be forgotten, Achmet was firangled by
Ithe Sultan's command , and Ruflan reinstat~ed
in ·the ossie ~of Vifier. - T~ogether with his for-
mer power, he re-affumedt the plan for exter-
minating- the race of 1Muffaphar which he had
concerted with Roxalana; and as they were
afraid that· an. only for whom MVuftapha had left ,
might ?grow, up ,to avenge his death, they re-
·doubled their a~tivity, and by employing the
fame artsagainft him which they had pra~tifed
·against his father, ·they -inpiried Solyman with
the fame fearapead prevailed on him to iffiue
orders for. putting to death that young innocen~t
Pfrince. Ther~e, orders were executedi with bare
barous zeal, by an eunuch, who was dispatched
to Bursa, the place where the Prince resided;
and no rival· wa~is left to d~ispute the Ottom~an
throne with t~he sons of Roxalana. t)

English, who, having several times s~een their
throne occupied by persons who were born.f~ub-
je~ts , had becom~e accustomed to an unceremo-·
nious and familiar intercourse with their fover-
eigns. They could not think, without the ut-
most uneafinef's, of admitting a foreign Prince
to that influence in their councils, which the
hdei;and of their Queen would naturally possess.
Thley dreaded, both from Philip's overbearing
temper, and from the maxims of the Spanifhm

fears and jealousy ..of a foreign malher. The
chief articles: were: Thait Philip, during his
-marria~ge with the Queen, thould bear the title
of K~ing of Enlgland, but the entire adminiftrla-
t~ion ,of affairs,, as well as the sole dif~pofatl of
all revenues, offices , and btenefice-s, thiould re-

kingdom; that if the Queen thould die before
him without issu~e, he would im~mediately leave

consequence of this mnarriage, England thould
not be engagfed in any war f'ub~liting between
F~rance anid Spain; anid that the alliance be-

Discontent and apprehenflons of the Englith.

But this treaty, though both the: Emperor

and Mary's miniffers employed their utmost ad-
dress in framing it so as to please the English·,
was far from quieting their fears and jealoufles.
They saw tha~t words and promises were a feeble
security against the encroachments of an am-
bitious Prince, who, as soon as he got poffelr
sion of the power and advantages wh-ich the
Queen's husband must necenarily enjoy, could
easily evade any of the articles which either
limited his authority or obftru~ted his schemes.
They were convinced that the more favourable
the conditions of the present treaty were to
England , the more P'hilip would be tempted to
violate them; and they dreaded that England,
Slike Naples , Milan, and the other countries

annexed to the Spanish crown, would soon feel
the intolerable weight of its oppreavll e domi-
nion, and be confirained, as thes~e had been, to
walte its wealth and vigour in wars wherein
it had no interest, and fr-om whicht it could de-
rive no advantage. There f~ientiments prevailed
To generally, that every part of the kingdom
was filled wiith dis~content at the match, and
with indignation against the advisers ofit.

Sir Thomas Wyat, a gentleman of fame note,

and of good intentions towards the publickr, took
advantage of this', and routed the inhabitants of
Ke~nt .to a-rms, .10 order to farye their country
from a foreiga. yoke. Such numbers resorted
in a thort· timne ·to his flandard; he marched to
London with fach rapidity; and the Queen was
·so utterly un prov-ided for defence , that the as-
paAofto affalirss was extremely threatening; and
if any noblem~an .of dif~tin~tion had joined the
nralecontents, or had.Wyat poffeffed talents equal,
in any degree, to the boldness of his enrterprize
-the inf~urreftion must have proved fatal to Mlary's
power. But all his measures were concerted with
f'olittle prudence, and executed with .inch irrefio-
Jution, that many, of his followers fors~ook him;
.the reft wrere dispersed by an handful of men ;
and he himsel-f was taken pris~oner , without
having made any effort worthy of the cause that
he had undertaken, or fa~itable to -the ardour
with which he engaged in it. H-e fuffered the
punit~hment due to his raft-nefs and rebellion.
The Queen's -authority was confirmed and in-
crea~e~d by her fixecefs in defeating this incon-
fiderate attempt to abridge it. The lady Jane
Gray, whose title the ambition of h·1er relations
had s~et up in opposition to the Queen's, was,
notwithstanding her youth and innocence, brought
to thle fecaffold. The lady Elizabeth, the Queen's

After, was observed with the most jealous at-
tention. The treaty of marriage was ratified
by the parliament.

The manrriage celebrated.

Philip landed in England with a magnificent

retinue , celebrated his nuptialg with great
solemnity * and though he could not lay aside
his natural severity and pride, or afftlme gra-
cious and popular manners, he endeavoured to
conciliate the favour of the English nobility by
his extraordinary liberality. In ca~e· that thould
fail of acquiring him s~uch influence in the govern-
ment of the kingdom as he aimed at obtaining ,
the Emperor kept a body of twelve thousand
men on the coast of Slanders, in readineifs to
embark for England, and to s~upport him in all
his enterprizes.

Mary's measures to overturn the Proteltant religion inl

England.

Emboldened by all there favourable circum-

stances, IVlary pursued the fecheme of extirpat-
ing the Protefiant religion out of her dominions,
with the moss precipitate zeal. The laws of
Edward the Sixth, in favour of the Reformation,
were repealed; the Proteffant clergy ejefted;
all the forms and rites of the Popith worthip
were re-established ; the liation was solemnly

absolved ·from the ·guilt which it had contra~ted
during the per~iod of its· apofa~cy , and was
publickly reconciled to the church of Rome by
cardinal Pole , who , immediately after the
Qu~een's marriage, was permitted to continue
his journey to England , and to exercise his
leg~atine Ifui~ptous with the most ample power.
Not fatisie~d with having~ ove~rturned the Pro-
tefk~ant church, and having eftablithied her own
system on its ruins, M~ary insisted that all her
fu~bjets tlhoulds conform to· the fanie mode of
worship .which· She preferr~ed·; thould profess
their faith in- th~e fame creed which the had a~p-
proved; and .abjure· every prsadtice or opinion
that was ~deeme~d repg~-nant to either of them.
Powers altoget~her. unknown in the Englis~h con-
fitattion , were vefked in certain persons ap-·
pointed to take cognizance of h~eresy, and the~y
proceeded to exercise them with more than in-
quifitorial severity. The profped of danger ,
however, did not intimidate the principal teach-
ers of the Protestant do~trines, who believed
that they were contending for truths of the
utmoit consequence to the happiness of mankind.
They boldly avowied their sentiments, and were
cond~emsned to that emel2 death which the church
of Rome reserves for its enemies. This t~hock-
ing punilthment was inflidted with that barbarity
which the rancour of false zeal alone can in-
spire. The English, who are inferior in huma-
nity to no· people in Europe, and remarkable

for the mildness~ of their publick executions ,
beheld , with ass onifhment and horror , persons
wlho had filled the most refpe~table flations in
their church, and who were venerable on ac-
count of their age , their piety , and their
literstate , condemned to endurie torinentas to
wthich even the moss attocious criminals were
not faubje~ted.

The obaacles which fth hard to farmimeun.

TIhis extreme rigouir did not accomplii'h the

end at which M~ary aimed, The patience and
fortitude with which there martyrs for the Re-
formation submitted to their fuff~eriings p the
heroick contempt of death expressed by persons
of everyT rank, and age, and sex , confirmed
many more in the Prsateftant faith, than the
threats of their earaged persecutors could
frighten into apoffacy. The business of such as
were entruffed with trying of hereticks multi-
plied continually, and appeared to be as endless
as it was odious. The Queen's ablest miniffers
became f'enfible how impolitick , as well as
dangerous, it was to irritate the people by the
frequent fpe~tacle of publick executions, which
they detefied as no les~s unjust than cruel.
Even Philip was so thoroughly convinced of
h~er having run to an exces~s of rigour, that on
occasion he aframed a part to which he was

But , notwithffanding this attempt to in-

gratiate himself with the Englifb, they discover-
ed a constant jealodfy and distrust of all his
intentions ; and when some members , who
had been gained by the court , ventured to
move in the Hous~e of Commons that the nation
ought to a~ift the Emperor, the Q2ueen's father-
in-law, in his war againit France, the proposal
was reje~ed with gene'ral diffatisfac~ion. A

thould- give its content that Philip might be

with fach a cold reception, that it was instantly

?on with the Q ueen of foch a powerful king-
doin, was obvious and formidable. He easily
foresaw that the English, no~twithstanding all
their fears and precautions , would be soon
drawn in to take part iri the qza~rrels on the
continent , and be compelled to a& in sub-
ferviency to the Emperor's ambitious schemes.
For this reason, Henry had given it in charge
to his ambaffatdor at the court of London ,
to employ all his addrelfs in order\ to defeat
or retard the treaty of marr~nage; and as there
was not , at that time , any Prince of the
blood in France , whom he could propose to
the Queen as a husband , he infirud~ed him
to co -operate with filch of the English as.
wvithed their fevereign to marry one of her
.own fa~bje~ts. But the Queen's ardour and
precipitation in closing with the ~first over-
tu~res in fayour of Philip., having rendered all
his endeavours inefetueasa, Henry was to far
fromn thinking' it prudent 'to give any aid to
the English malecontents , though earnefly
solicited by WCyat and their other leaders ,
who tempted him to take them under his
prote~tion , by offers of great advantage to
France , that he' commanded his ambassador
to congratuxlate the Queen i~n the wartneft
terms upon the Fuppreflion of the in~flr-
re~tion,

Hls, ~peyor epaor atos for a vigorous campaign.

But, notwithflanding there external pro..

feflions , Henry dreaded so. much the confe-
quience of thi's alliance, whic~h,more than com-
penfated for all the Emperor h~ad lot in Ger-
many, that he determined to carry on his mi-.
litary operations bothb in the Low Countries,
and in Italy, with extraordinary vigour, in or-.
der that he might compel Charles to accept of:
an equitable peace, before his daughter-in-law
could farmount ~the` averflon of her furbjeats to
a war on the conltinent, and prevail on them,
to allift the Emperor either with money or
troops. For this purpose he exerted himself to
the utnxoft inl order to. have a numerous army
early assembled on the frontiers of the Ne~ther.
lands, and while' one part of it laid wafe the
open country of Artois, the main body, under
the Conflable Montmorency, advanced towards
the pjrovinces of Liege and. Hainault by the so-
reft of Arldennes.

The progress of his arms.

The campaign was. opened with the siege

of INiarietnburgh, a town which the Queen of
Hlungary, the governers of the Losy Countries,
had fortified at great; exupence.; but, being de-
ititute of a i~fuicient garrison, it: surrendered in
fix days. (June ag. I554.) Henry , elated with
this fauccefs , put himself at the head of his

army, and inveffing Bouvines, took it by as-
fkult, after a. Thlort resistance. . With equal fa-
cility he became master of Dinant; and then
.turning to the left bent his march towards the
~province of Artois.

The Emp-eror little able to obttruft it.

The waft~ sums which the Emperor .had re-

mlitted into England had t'o exhauffed his trea-
fury, as to render his preparations at this junc-
ture, flower and more dilatory ithan usual. He
.had no body of troops to make head against
the French at their first entrance into his terri-
tories; and though he drew together all the
forces in the country in the utmost hurry, and
.gave the command of them to Emnanuel Philibert
of Savoy , they were in no condition to face
an enemy to far superior in number. The Prince
·of Savoy, however, by his aaivityt and good
condudt, made up for his want of troops. By
·watching all the motions of th~e French at a dif-
tance, and by chufing his own poffs w~ith skill,
he put it out of their power either to form any
siege of cons~equence , or to attack him. W~ant
.of fubfillence soon obliged them to fall back to-
w~ards their own frontiers, a-fter havin~g burnt
all the open towns, and having plundered the
country through whic~h they marched with a
cruelty and licence , more becoming a body of
light troops, than a royal army led by a great
mlo na rch7.

SThbe F~rench invelt Renti.

But Henry , that he might not dif~mits his

army without attempting some conquest ade-
qua~te to the vast preparations, ·as well as fan-.
guine hope's, with which he had opened the
campaign, invefied Renti, a place deemed in
that age of great importance, as, by its fitua-
ti~on on1 the confines of Artois and the' Boulon-
nois, it covered the former province , and pro.-
tefied the- parties which made incurflons into
the latter. The town, which was firong~ly
fortified and provided with a numerous garrison·,
.made a gallant defence; but being warmly press-
ed by a powerful army, it: muff soon have
yielded. The Emperor, who at that time en-
'joyied a thort interval of ease from the gout,
was to, solicitous to save it, that, although he
coxild bear no other motion but- that of a litter,
he inflantly put himself at the head of his army,
which having received several reinforcements
was now firong enough to approach the enemy.
TPhe french were eager to decide the fate olf
Renti by a battle, and expeft~ed it from the
Emperor's arrival in his camp ; but Charles
avoided a general altion with g~reat indaffry,
and as he had nothing in view but to save the
town, he hoped to accomplifhz that, without
expoiing himself to the consequences of such -a
dangerous and doubtful event.

Netwithfkanding all his precautions, a dif-

pute, about a p~ost which. both armies endea-

Emperor , notw~ithstanding the loss which he
had s~ustained, continued in the fame camp ;
and~ the French, being firaightened for pro-
viflons, and finding it impoifible to carry on
the siege in the face of an hostile army,
quitted their int-renchments. They· retired open-
ly, courting the enemy to appedach, rather
than Chunning an engagement.

In Sie~na, Tuifcany would soon feel the effe £s

with the utmost solicitude for the expulflon of
the French out of the Sienef~e, before they had
time to eitablifh themselves thoroughly in the
pocuntry, or to receive such reinforcements from
France as would render it dangerous to attack
them. Ase this, however, was properly the
Emperor's business, who was called by his in-
terest as well as honour to dislodge those for-
midable intruders into the heart of his domini-
ons, Cosmo laboured to throw the whole bur-
slen of the enterprize on him; and on that ac-
count had given no afifrtance, during the for.
mer campaign, but by advancing- some fmnall
sums of money towards the payment of the Im-
perial troops.

He negociates With the Emperor.

But as the defence of the Netherlands en-

gross~ed all the Emperor's attention , and his re-
mittances into England had drained his treaf~u-
.ry, it was obvious that his operations in Italy
would be extremnely feeble; and Cosmo plainly
,perceived, that if he himself did not take part
openly in the war, and a~t with vigour, the
French would fecarcely meet with any annoy-
arnce. As his situation rendered this resolution
neceilary and Iunavoidable, his next care was

to execute it in fath a manner, that he mighPrt
der~efive ro i't some other advantage, beside
that of driving th~e French out of his neigh-
bourhood. With this view r, he dispatched an
~envoy'to Charles, offering to declare war agahinf
Fran~ce,, and to reduce Siena at his own cha, -
ges, on condition that he thould be repaid
whatever he thould expend in the entbrpriee, and
be permitted to retain all his conqtiefts until
his demands criere fully fatlsfied. Charles, to
whom, as this jun~ture, the war ag~ainst Siena
~irajs an intolerab~le burdren, and who had neither
expedient nor resource that could enable
him to carry it on with proper vigour, closed
gladly with this overture; and Corrno, well a~c-
quainted with the low Hatte of the Imperial sinan-
esii, ftlattere~d himself that the Emperor , finrd-
ing I't impossible to reimburse him, would fuffer
him to keep quiet poffeffion of whatever places
he thould conquer, d)

Enters into war with France.

Full of there hopes, he made great prepa-

rations for war, and as the French King had
tur~ned the firength of his arms against the
N~ether~lands, he did not despair of assembling
such a body of men as would prove more than
a fufficient match for any force which Henry
could bring into the field in Italy, He endea-

He attempted to detaoh the Duke of Odini,

whose family had b~een long attached to .the
French party from his ancient confederates, by
beffowing on him another of his daughters; and
what was of greater consequence that either
of there, he engaged John James Medecino,
Marquis of lMarign~ano, to tak~e the command
of his ~army. e) This officer, from a very low
condition in life, had raised himf'elf, through
all the ranks of service , to high command, and
had displayed talenlts, and acquired reputation
in war which entitled him to be placed on a

ag~e. Having attained a flation of eminence so,
disproportionate to his birth, he laboured with
a fond solicitude to conceal his original obf~cu-
rity, by giving out that he was def'cended of
thle family of Medici, to which honour the ca-
folal resemblance of his name was his only pre-
tenflon , Cosmo, happy that he could gratify
him at such ~an eafyr rate, .flattered his vanity

that family of wvhich~ hte now considered himself
as a branch, applied- with wonjde~rful zeal- and
assiduity to raise troops; and as, during his
long service, he had acquired great credit with
the leaders of those mercenary bands which.
formed the firength of Iltalian artnies, he engag·-
ed the anoft eminent of them to. follow Cofmo's
Itandard.

Peter Strqjzzi entruafed with the command of the French

army in Italy.

To oppose this able general, and the for-

inidable army which he had assembled, the King
of France made choice of Peter Stroz zi, a Flo-
i-entine nobleman, who had resided long in
~Fran~ce, as an exile, and who had risen by his
merit to high reputation, as well as command
ini the army. He was the son of Philip Stroz-
zi, who,'in the year one thousand five hundred
and thirty - seven , had concurred with such ar-
dour in the attempt to expel the family of Mle-
dici out of Florence, in order to re-eftabif~h
the ancient republican form of government; and
who had perithed in the undertaking. The son
inherited the implacable averfien to the MVedici,
as well as the fame enthufiaftick zeal for the
liberty of Florence which had animated hlis fa-
ther, whos~e death he was impatient to revenge.
Henry flattered himself that his army would
make rapid progress u~nder a general whole zeal

to promote his interest was rolifed and seconded
by fach powerful pafflons; ef~peciarlly as he hsd'
allotted him, for the s~cene of a~tion, his native
country, in which he had many powerful par-
tifans, ready to facilitate all his' operations.

The irnprudence of th;is ~choke~.

But how [pecious s~oever th;e· moitives mIight

appear which. induced Henry - to ma~ke th~is
choice, it proved fatal to th~e interest of Fratice
in Italy. Cofmno, as soon as he heard that the
mortal enemy of his family wvas appointed to
take the command in Tuscany, concluded that:
the King of France aimed at something more
than the prote~tion of the Sienefe , and sa~w
the necefi~ty of making extraordinary efforts,
not merely to reduce Siena, but to save himself
from deftru~t~ion. f) At the fame time , the
Cardinal of Ferrara , who had the entire direc-
tion of the French affairs in Italy , considered
Strozzi as a formidable rival in power, and in
order to prevent his acquiring any increase of
authority from s~uccess, he was extremely re-
miss in iApplying him either with money to
pay his troops, or with proviflons to. support
them. Strozzi himself, blinded by his resent-
ment ag~ainst the M\/edici, pufn~ed on his ope-
rations with the impetuosity of revenge, rather

'The battle of IVlarcirno.

towns in the' territory of Florence with s~uch
vigour as aiged ]Medecino, in ·order to checkr
his progrei~s, ~to withdraw the greater part of
his army frost Siena , ·which he had invefied
before Strozzi'sa~arrival in Italy. . As Cosmo

tions ,,th~e expence of which ~mtR it on have
exhaulited his revenues; as neither the viceroy
of Naples nor the governor of Milan were in con-
dition to afford. him any e~ffeaual aid; and as
the troops w~hich Medecino had-left in the camp
lwfore Siena .could attempt nothing against -it

utring his absence; it was S-trozz-i's bufinrefs to
have protraded the war , and <to have trans-
ferred the fCeat of it into the territories of Flo-
rence; but the hope of ruining his enemy by
one decisive blow, precipitated him (August 3-
z554.) into a. general engagement not far from
MVarciano.

In wnhich the French are defeated.

The armies were nearly equal in number;

but a body of Italian cavalry, in which Strozzi
placed great confiden~e , having fled without
making any resistance, either throuigh the trea-
chery or cowardice of the off~cers who com-

mnilitary dignities, without any pret~etflolns to
attain them but wh~at he 'coultd derive hfcorn
merit, he determined to diftingulfh his defe~nce
rof Siena by extraord~inaty efibrts of valour and
perseverance. F~or this purpose , he repaired
and fkrengthened the fortifications with tinwea,
ried induffry ; he trained the citiiens to the
are of arms, and accuffomed them to go through
the fatigued and dangers of service In common
with the soldiers; antd as the enem4· were ex-
tremely firiat in guar~ding all the avenues to
the city, he hufbanded the proviflons in the
magazines with the most parsimonious ceconomy,
and prevailed on the s~oldiers , as well as the
`citizens, to refiri~it themselves to a very mo-
-derate daily allowance for- their fabliftence.
Medecino, though his army was not numerous
enough to storm the town by open force ,
ventured twice to assault it by surprise; but he

was received each time with to much s~pirit,
and repulsed with fach loss , as discouraged
hiim from repeating the attempt, and left him
no hopes of reducing the town but by. famine.

* Aedecinho converts the fiege.into a blockade.

With this viewv, he-fortified his own camp

wvith great care , occupied all the poss s of
firength round the place,· and having entirely
cdt off- the belieged from any communication
wiith the adjacent country, he waited pacitntly
until necellity thould compel them to op~en
their grates. But: their enthuflaftick zeal for
liberty made the citizens defplfe the diftrefefs
oceafloned by the fearcity of provisions, and
even supported them long under all the tniferies
of famine: Monluc, by his example and ex-~
hortations , taught hiis soldiers to vie with
them in patience and abitinence; and it was
not unitil they had writhilood a flege of ten
months, until they had eaten up all the horses,
dogs, and other animals in the place, and were
reduced almost to their last modekl of bread ,
that they propos~ed a capitulation. ]Even then
they demanded honourable terms; and as Cos-
mo, though no stranger to the extremity of
their condition, was afr~aid that despair might
prompt them to venture upon some wild enter-
prize, he immediately granted them conditions
maore fav\oulrable than they could have expe~ed.

.Th~e town obliged by famine to capitulate.

Trhe capitulation was made; (April sa.

t555.) in the Emperor's h~ame, who engaged
to take the republic of Siena under the pro-
te~tion of the Empir~e; he promised to maintsiin
the ancient liberties of thle city, to allow the
magistrates the fall exercise of their former
authority, to s~ecure the citizens in the undiic-
turbed poffeiron of their privileges and pro-
perty; he granted an ample and unlimited par-
.don to all who had born arms against him ;
he reserved to himself the right of pla~cing a
garrison in the town , but engaged hot to
rebuild the citadel without the confelt: of~ the
citizens. Mlodluc and his French garris~on were
allowed to march out with all the honours
of war.

Many of the Sienete retire to Mont - Alcino; and

eaabifh a free government there.

M~edecinlo oblerved the articles of capitalfa-

tion, as far as depended on him, with great
exa~tne~rs, No violence or ins~ult: whatever w~as
o~ffered to the inhabitants, and the French gar-
rifon was treated with all the refpe~t due to
their spirit: and bravery. But many of the
citizens furzpe~ting, from the extraordinary fa-
cility with which they had obtained s~uch fa-
vourrable conditions, that the Emperor, .as well
as Cosmo, would take the first opportunity of

violating: them , and dis~daining· to posses~s
precarious liberty, which depended on the
will of another, abandoned the place of their
nativity, and accompanied the French to MVonta-
Alcino, Porto Ercole, and other fmnall towns
in the territory of the republic. They efta-
blif~hed, in IVont6-Alcino,~ the fame model of
gbverpment to which they had been accuitomed
at Siena, and appointing magiffrates with the
fame titles and jurifdi~tion , s~olaced themselves
with this image of their ancient liberty.

Hiardfhips to which the citizens of Siena were tub.~

jeted..

The. fears of the Sienere concerning. the

f~ate of their country were not imnaginary, or
their futpicion of the Emperor and Colmno ill-
founded; for no sooner had the Imperial troops
taken poffeilion of the town , than Cofmzo,
without regarding the articles of capitulation,
not only displaced the magistrates who were
in office, and nominated new ones devoted to.
his own i~nterest, but commanded all the citi-
zens to deliver up their arms to persons whom
he appointed to receive them. They fubmnitted
to the former from neceility , though withr
all the relu~tance and regret which men ac-
cuftomed to liberty feel in obeying the fi~rst
commands of a malter. T~hey did not lyield
the faqte tame obedience to the latter;, and

many persons of diftin~5ion, rather than degrade
themselves fromr the rank of free men to the
condition~ of slaves, by thrrendering their arms,
fled to their countryni~en at 1Monti-Alcino, and
chose to endure all the hardfhlips, and encounter
all the dangers which they had .reafbn to ex-
pe~t in that newl Rtation, where they had fixed
the feat of their republick.

Cofsno attacks those who had retired.

Cofmoo, not reckoning himself secure while

such numbers of implacable and des~perate ene-
mies were f~ettled in his neighbourhood, and
retained any degree of power, solicited Mede-
cino to' attack them in their different places of
retreat, before they had time to recruit their
itrength and spirits, after the many calamities
which they had f~uffe~red. He prevailed on
him, though his army was mnuch weakened by:
hard duty during the siege of Siena, to invest
Porto Ercole; and the fortifications being both
flight and incomplete;, the besieged were soon
compelled to- open their gates. An unexpeft-
ed order, which Medecing received (June I3,
z555.·) from the Emperor to detach the greater
part of his troops into Piedmont, prevented
farther operations , and permitted the Sienefe.
exiles to reside for s~ome time *undiflturbed in

who remained at Siena, were not yet at the

end of their fufferings; for the Emperor, in-
Read of adhering tq? the arrticles of capitula-
tiqu , granted: his s~on Philip the i~nveffiture of

Operations in Piedmo~nt.

Tfhe Imperial army in Piedmont had been

to fe~eble, for f'ome tin-e , and its commander

He 'pitched on the Duke of Alva for that

purpore; but it was as much the effe& ofa
court. intrigue, as of his opinion of the Duke's
merit, which' led him to this choice. Alva had
long attended' Philip with the utmost alliiduityr,
and had endeavoured to work hitnfelf into his
confidence byi all the inflanting arts of which
his haughty and inflexible nature was capable,
As he nearly refemibled that Prince in many sea-
tures of his charadter, he began to gain· much
of his good-will. Ruy Gomez de Silva, Philip's
favourite, who dreaded the progress which this
formidable rival made in his malter's affe~tions,
had the address to prevail with the Emperor to
name Alva to this command. The Dukje, though
sensible that he owed this difkindtion to the ma-
licious. arts of an enemy, who had no other
aim than to remove him at a distance from
court, was of such punafilious honour, that he
would not decline a command that appeared
dangerous and difficult, but, at the fame time,
so haughty, that he would not accept of it but
on his own terms, insisting on being appointed
the Emperor's Vicar-general in Italy, with the
supreme military command in all the Imperial
and Spanish territories in that country. Char-
les granted all his demands; and he took per~-

But what ICharles ·wanted in force, he eni-

deavouted to s~upply by a bold fkratagem , the
Auccef~s oft wh~ich would have been equall to that
of the most ivigorous campaign. Duringr the
fiiege of Mets,: Leonard, Father Guardian of a
~onvent of Francifbans in that city, had infi-
nuated himself far into the effeem and favour
of the Duke of Guite, by his attachment to the
French. Being a pnan of an a~tive and in.-
trigruing spirit, he had been extremely ofeful: both
in animating the inhabitants to sustain with pa-
tience all-the hardships of the siege, and in pro-
curing intelligence of the, enemies designs and
-motions. The merit of those important fervi-
ces, together with the warm recommendations
-of the Duke of Guise. fiecured ·him such -high
confidence with VCielieville., who was appoint-
ed governor of M5etz when Gulfe left the town,

?The Father Guardian accomplithed what he

:had undertaken to perform with great secrecy
and dispatch. By his authority and arguments,
as well as by the profped of wealth or honours
which he s~et before his monks, happ~revailed,
on all of them to enter into the consp~iracy. He
introduced into the convent,- without being s~us-
pefted, as many soldiers as were thought s~us--
ficient. The governor of Thionville, apprized
in due time of the design, had- assembled a
proper number of troops for executing it; and

But, happily for France, on the very day

that was fixed for fitrikinlg the blow, Vielle--
ville, an able and vigilant officer, received in-
formation from a spy whom be entertained at
Thionville, that: certain Franc~iscan friars resort-
ed frequently thither, and .were admitted to
many private conferences with the g~overnor ,
who was carrying on preparations for some mil

litary enterprize with great difyiatch, but with
a moss myfier~ious secrecy. This was failircientl
;to awakeh Vie~llville's furpjicions. W~ithout
communicating there to any person, he inflantly
visited the c'onvent: of Francircans; dete~ted the
s~oldiers who were concealed there; and forced
them to dis~cover as much as they knew con-
ccerning the nature of the enterprize. The fa-
ther Guardian , who had gone to Thionvi~ll
;that he might put: the last hand to his machnna-
tions ,was seized at the gate as he returned;
and be , in order to save himself from th6
rack, revealed all the circumfltances of the` con-
fpi racy.

A body of imperialists defeated.

Vielieville not satisfied with having seized

the traitors, and having fruffrated their schemes,
was solicitous to take advantage of the difcove-
ties w~hich he had mad'e, so as to be revenged
on the Imperialists. For this purpose he marched
out with the best troops in his garrison, and
placing there in ambush near the road, by which
the Father Guardian had informned him that the
governor of Thnionville would approach Metz,
he fell upon the Imperialists w~ith great fu~ry,
at they advanc~-ed in perfe~t security, without
fiufp~e~ting any danger to be near. Confounded
at this sudden attack, by an enemy whom they
expe~ted to s~urpris~e, they made little resistance;
'and: a great part of the trooPs employed in th~is

f'ervice, among which were many persons of
diftipftion, was killed or taken prisoners. Be-

ing exemplary punif'hment upon them, in order
to deter others from venturing to commit the
fame crime, became to evident, that orders
were ifrued to proceed to their trial. Their
guilt was made apparent by the clearest evi-
dence; and f~entencet of death was passed upon
the Father: Guardian together with twenty
Imonks. On the evening previous to the day
fixed for their execution, the goaler took them
out of the dungeons in which they had hit~herto
been confined s~eparately, and that them all up

q.uillity, as afforded the diet ffr11 leifore to deli-
herate, and to eliablilh proper regulations con-
cerning a point of the greatest consequence to
the internal peace of the Empire. By the·
treaty of Paffau in one thousand five hundred
and fifty-two, it had' been refelrred to the neut:
diet of the Empire to confirm and perfe~t the
plan of religious pacification, which was there
agreed upon. The terror and confuflon with
which the violent commotions excited by Albert
of Brandenburg had filled th~e Empire, as well
as the const~ant attention which Ferdinand was
obliged to give to the affairs of Hungary, had
hitherto prevented the holding a diet, though
it had been fammntoned, s~oon after the conclusion
of the treaty, to meet at Augsburg.

Diet held at Auglburg, and Ferdinand's speech in it.

But as a Diet was now nece~iary on many

accounts , Ferdinand about the beginning of
this year had repaired tG Augsburg. Though
few of the Princes were pres~ent either in per-
son or by their deputies, he opened the affem-
bly by a speech, in which he propos~ed a ter-
mination of the diffentions, to which the new
tenets and controversies with regard to religion
had given rife , not only as theofirfl and great
bufinef's of the diet, but as the point which
both the Emperor and be had most at heart.
He ~represented the innumerable obitacles which
the Emperor had to faurmount before he could

how vathr it was to expe~t anly remedy for
evils, which d~emanded immiediate redress from
a general council , the assembling ps wvhich
would either he prevented, or its deliberaztions
be in~terrupted: by the diffentions and hoffilities
of the Pri-nces of Christendom; that a national
coiunciil in Gerlsan-y, which, as fomxe ima·in ed,
mhight be cal~led· with! greater ease, and delibe-
rate with moire perfe~t tecurity, was an a~ffetn-
bly of an unpreceden~ted naturre , the jurifdiic-
tion of whichr wars uncertain in its extent, and~
the foun of its proceedings undefined; that in
his opinioix there remained but: one method for
composing their unhap~py differesces i, which
though it had bee~n often tried with~out fulccers,
inight yet prove effe~tuaal if it were attempted
·with a better and more p~acifi~ck· spirit than had
appeared on for'mer occations , and that was
to choose a: few meun of learning, abilities, and
modceration , who, by difcuiffng the dis~puted
articles in anl atmicable confe~r~ence, might ex-
plain them in d~uc~h a manner as to bring the
contending parties either to unite in fentimenrt,
or -to differ with charity.

Susp~icions and fears of the ProteR~ants.

T'his Cpeech being printed in common form,

and difpyerfed over the Empire , revived the
fears and jealouiies of the Protefiants ; Ser-
dih~and, thiey observed wish much surprise, had
not once mentioned, in his addres~s to the diet,
the treaty of PaR'au, the flipulations of which
they considered as the great security of their
religious liberty. The furpicions to which this
gave rife were confirmed by the accounts which
they daily received of the extreme rigour with
which Ferdinand treated their Protefiant breth.
ren in his hereditary dominions ; and , as it
was natural to confider his a~tions as the fareft
indication of his intentions , this diminished
their confidence in those pompous profefilons of
moderation or of zeal for thie re - establish~ment
of ·concord, to which his pradice was to utterly
repugnant.

There inreated by the arrival of a auncio from the

Pope to the diet.

The arrival of the Cardinal 1Vorone, whom

the Pope had appointed to attend the diet as
his nuncio , completed their conviftion , and
lJeft them no room to doubt that some dangerous
machination was forming against the peace or
safety of the Protestant church. Julius, elated
with the unexrpe~ted return of the English na-
tion from apofkacy , began to flatter himself ,
that~the spirit of mutiny and revolt having now

spent its force , the happy period wvas come
when the church might resume its 'ancient au-
thority, and be obeyed by the people with the
fame tame fubmifflon as formerly. Full of these
hopes he had sent IMorone to Augsburg, with
infkruftions to employ his eloquence in order
to excite the Germans to imitate the laudatble
example of the Englis~h, and his political ad-
drers in order to prevent any decree of the diet
to the detriment of the catholick faith. As
Mtorone inherited from his father, the chancel-
lor of Milati, uncotnmon talents for negociation
and intrigue , he could hardly have failed of
embarrafirng the measu~res of the Proteftrants in
the diet, or of defeating whatever they aimed
at obtaining in it for their farther s~ecurity.

But an unforeseen event: delivered them

from all the danger which they had reason to
apprehend from MCorone's presence. Julius, by
abandoning himself to pleasures and amufel
ments , no less unbecoming his age than his
charadter, having contra~ed s~uch habits of dif-
fipation, that any serious occupation, especially
if attended with difficulty, became an intoler-
able burden to himn, had long resifted the so-
licitations of his nephew to hold a confiffory,
btecaufe` he expedted there a violent opposition
to his s~chemes in favour of that; young man.

vent for eluding this request were exhauffed,
and at the fhtme time his indolent averflon to
business continued to grow upon him, he feign-
led indiilpolition rather than yield to his nephew's
importunity; and that he might: give the deceit
a greater colour of probability, he not only
confined himfielf to his apartment, but changed
jhis usual diet and manner of life.~ By persisting.
too long in adting this ridiculous part, he coni
tradted it real dif~eaf'e, of which he died in a few:
days, (MYarch 23. I555.) leaving his infamous
minion the Cardinal de IMonte to bear his name,
and to di~g~race the dignity which he had con-
ferred upon him. m) As soon as, MIorone heard
of his death, he s~et out abruptly from Augsburg,

he might be pres~ent at the eledtion of a new,

One casfe of their s~uspicions and fears being

thus removed, the Protestants soon became f~en4

nand's intentions, however specious, were ill-
founded, and that he had no thoughts of vio-
lating the articles favourable to them in the

lence of civil war, had inflamed to the high-
eft pitch.

The pretenrions of the Catholicks and Protestants.

The Protefiants contended , that the Fecn-

rity which they claimed in consequence of the
treaty of Paffan thould extend, without limita-
tion , to all who had hitherto embraced the
do~trine· of Luther , or who t~hould hereafter
embrace it. The Cateholicks, having first of all
asserted the Pope's right as the supreme and
final judge with refpee? to all articles of faith,
declared, that though, on account of the present
situation of the Empire, and for the fake of
peace, they were willing to confirm the tole-
ration granted by the treaty of Paffau, to foch
as had adopted the new opinions; they must
insist that this indulgence thould not be ex-
tended either to thof'e cities which had con-
formed to· th1e Interim, or to s~uch ecclefiafitckrs
as tihould for the future apofi-atize from the
church of Romae. It was no easy matter to
reconcile such opposite pretensions, which were
supported, on each fide, by the most elaborate
arguments, and the greatest acrimony of expref-
sion, that the abilities or zeal of theologians
long ekercifed in disputation could f~uggeit. Ser-
dinand, however, by his address and perfever-
ance; by fastening some things on each iide;
by putting a favourable meaning upon othlers ;
·by representing incefrantly the necessity as wetl

Ing, on s~ome occasions, when all other con-
Exderations were disregarded , to din~olve the
diet, brought them at length to a. conclusion in
which they all agreed.

The peace of religion eRabliThed.

Conformably to this, a Reers~ was framed,

(Sept. 25. x5;55.) approved of, and p~ublished
with the usual ormalities. The following are
the chief articles Shich it contained: That fach
Princes and cities as have declared· their appro-
bation of the Confeilion! of Aug~sburg, s~hall be
permitted to profess the d-o~rine and exercise
the worship wrhich it authorises, without in-
terruption or moleltation from the Emperor ,

Reflexions on the progress of the principles of tole-

ration.

Such are the capital azrtcles in this famlous

Receiks, wvhich is the basis of religious peace
in Germany, ~and the bond of union among; its
various Rtates, the feantirn entss of w hi ch a re so
extremely ;differ~ent with refped~tto points the
anoit intereffing as w~e4l as im~portant. In our
age and nation, to wh7~ich the idea of To~leration
is famniliar, andl its b8enedi~cial ~e~2eas well known,
it may s~eem frange, that a method of ternii-
asating their diR~entions, fe fi~jitable to the m~ild
mid chiarta~ble fpirPait of the Chriitian reigion,
did not sooner ~ocenr to the contersding palrtites.

But this expedient, however salutary, was to
repugnant to the sentiments and pradtice of
Christians during many ages, that it did not lie
obvious to dis~covery. Among the ancient hea-
therts, all whose deities were local and tute-
lary, diversity of sentiment concerning the ob-
je&t or rites of religious worship seems to have
been no source of animnofity, because the ac-
knowledging veneration to be due to any one
God , did not imply denial of the exiftenice or
the power' of any other God; nor were the
modes and rites of worship established in one
country incompatible with those which other
nations approved of and observed. Thus the
erroi~s in their fyfitem of theology were of such
a nature as to be produative of concord; and
notwithflanding the amazing number of their
deities, as well as the infinite variety of their
ceremonies, a s~ociable and tolerating spirit sub-
sifted almost universally in the pagan world.

But when the Chriftiasn revelation declar~ed

one Supreme Being to be the f'ole objeat of re-
ligious veneration, preferibed the form of wor-
Enip most acceptable to him, whoever admitted
the truth of it held, of consequence , every
other mode of religion to be abs~urd and im-
pious. Hence the zeal of the first converts to
the Christian faith in propagating its do~trines,
and the ardour writh which they laboured to
overturn every other form of wort'hip. They
employed,-however, for this purpose no me-

thods but such as suited the nature of religion.
By the force of powerful arguments , they conrs
vinced the un~derflandings of men; by the
charms of superior virtue, they allured and capr
tivated their hearts, At length the civil power
declared in favour of Chriikianity; and though
numbers, imitating the example of their f~upe-
riors , crowded into the church, many still ad-
'hered to their ancient superstitions. Enraged
at th~eir obstinacy, the miniffers of religion,
whose zeal was s-till unab~ated, though their
fan Frity and virtue were much diminished ,
forgot To far the nature of their own mifflon,
and of the arguments, which they ought to have
employed, that they armed the Imperial power
against there unhappy men, and as they could
not persuade , they tried to compel them to
believe.

At the fame time, controversies concerning

articles of, faith multiplied, fr~om various causes,
among Christ-ians themselves, and the fame un-
h-allotwed weapons which had first been used
againit the enemies of their religion, were turned
against each other. Every zealous disputant
endeavoured to interest the civil magiffrate is
his cause, and each in his turn employed the
facular arm to cruf'h or to exterminate his op-
ponents. Not long after, the bifhlops of Rome
put in their claim to infallibilit~y in ex plainia g
articles of faith , and, deciding points in contro-
vertyz; and, bold as the preteniion was, they,

by their artifices and perfeveriance, impos~ed on
the~ credulity of mankind, and brought them to
re~cognise it. To doubt or to -deny any doc-
trin~e to whichl there unerring infirudtors had
giv~en the fan~tibh of their approbation , was
held to be not only a refriting of truth ,
but an a& 'of rebellion againik their fCacred au-
thority : and the secular power, of which
by various arts they had acquired the absolute
dire~tion, was inflantly employed to avenge both.

Thus Europe had b~een accuffomed, during

many centuries, to fee speculative opinionis
propagatedf or defended by force; the charity
and mutual fo~rbearance which Christianity re-
commendss with so much warmth, were forgot-
ten, the sacred rights of confeience and of pri-
vate judgment were unheard of , and not only
the idea of toleration, but even the word itself,
in thle sens~e now affixed to it, was unknowvn.
A right to extirpate error by force, was uni-
verfally allowed to be the prerogative of s~uch
as poiKefFed the knowuledge, of truth; and as each
party of Christians believed that they had got
poireffion of this invaluable attainment, they
all claimned and exercised, as far as they were
able, the rights which it was s~upposed to con-
vey. The Roman catholicks, as their fyfftem
refk~ed on the decisions of an infallible judge ,
never doubted that truth was on their fide, and
openly called ·on the civil power to repel the

and~ heretical innovators wYho had risen

impi~ous

The Prot~estants,

up against it. no les~s con-
sident that their do~trine was well founded, re-
quired, wtith equal ardour, the Princes of their
party to check s~uch as prefuxmed to impugn or
to appose it. Luther, Calvia, Cranmer, Knox,

rerpe~tive countries,
had power and oppe infli~ted

·disciples by the church of Rome, upon foch

it wvould have appeared a tymptom

- Advantages of the relig~ious peace to~ the Lirtherans;

The Recers of Augfbturg, it is evident, was~

founded on no fuxch liberal and enlarged fCenti-
ments concerning freedom of reli~gio~us inquiry ,
or the nature of Toleration.. ~It was nothing
more than a s~cheme of pacification , which po-·
litical considerations alone had fuggeff·ed to the
contending parties , and regard for th~eir mutual
tranquillity and safety had rendered necessary.
Of this there can be no firong~~er proof than an
article in the Recess itelf , by which· the b~ene-
fits of th~e pacification are -declared to extend
only to the ;Catholicks on the one fide , and to
fouch as adhiered to the confeflion of Augsburg
on the othe%. The. followers of Zuinglius and
Calvin remained, in consequence of that exclu-
sion, without any protef5tion from the rigour
of the laws denounced against hereticks. Nor
did, they obtain any legal s~ecurity, until the
treaty of Westphalia , near a century after this
period, provided, that they thoulp be admitted
to enjoy , in as ample a manner as the Luther-
ans, all the advantages and prote~tion which
the Recess of Augsburg afFordls.

and

and to the Catholicks.

:But if the followers of Luther were hiighly

pleafedt with the s~ecurity which they acquired
by this Recess, fazch ~as adhered to the ancient:
Ijyftemn had no less reafen to be s~atisfied with
that article in it, which preserved entire to the
Roman catholick church benefices of fuxch eccle-
fiaiticks as thould· hereafter renounce its doc-
trines. This article , known in G-·rmany by
the name of th~e Ecclesiastical R~eservation , was
apparently so conformable to the idea and to
the rightcs of an eilablif~hed church, and it s~eem-
ed to equitable to prevent revenues , which
had been originally appropriated for the main-
tenlance of persons attached: to a certain ijyftem,
from being alienated to any other purpose, that
the Protefiants, though they foresaw its confe-
q-uences, were obliged to relinquit~h their op-
p~olition to it. As the Roman catholick Princes
of the Empire have taken care to fee this article
exa~tly oblerved in every cafe where there was
an opportunity of putting it in execution, it has
proved the great barrier of the Romith church
in Germany against, the Reformation; and as,
from this period , the fame temptation of interest
did not allure ecclefrifticks to: relinquish the
eftablif'hed jlyftemr, there have been few of t~hat
order , w~ho havre loved t~ruth withi fuchi di-fin-

IVMarcellus ii. ele~ed Pope and his charader.

During the fitting of the diet, M~arcellus

Cervino, Cardinal of Santa Croce, was ele~ted
(April 9. 1555.) Pope in room of Julius. He, in
imitation of Adrian, did not change his name
on being exalted to the papal chair. As he
equaled that Pontif in purity of intention,
while hie excelled him much in the arts of go-
vernment, and &ill more in k~nowledge of the
Aate and genius of the papal court; as he had
capacity to diifcern what reformation it needed,
as well as what it could bear; sauch regulations
were expedted from his virtue and wifdorta , as
would have removed many of its grofifeft and
most flagrant corruptions, and have contributed
towards reconciling to the church such as, from
indignation at there enormities, had abandoned
its comnmunion, But this excellent Pontif was;
only thown to the church, and immediately
hnatched away.

His death.z

The confinemeut in t~he conclave had im-

paired his health , and the fatigue of tedious
ceremonies upon his acceilion, together with
too intense and anxious application of mind to
the schemes of improvement which he meditat-
ed, exhauffed to entirely the vigour of his feeble
con~itution , that he fickrened on the twelfth,

-and died on the twentieth day after his elecs
tion. p)

The eleaion of Paul IV.

All the refinements in artifice and intrigue,

peculiar to conclaves, were displayed in that
which was · held for elefting a fuccefor to Mar.
cellus; the Cardinals of the Imperial and French
far~ions labouring, with equal ardour, to gain
the necessary numb~er of fuffrages for one of their
own party. But, 'alfter a. fruggle of no long
duration, though conduafed with all the warmth
and eagernefrs natural to men contending for fo'
great: an objeC2, they united (M~ay 23. I555.) in
chufing John Peter Cara~Ffa, the eldest member of
the sacred college, and the son of Count M~on-
torio, a nobleman of an illustrious family in the
kingdom of Naples. The address and influence
of Cardinal Farnef'e, who favoured his preten-
Elons, Caraffa's own merit, and perhaps his
great age, which soothed all the disappointed
candidates, with the near profpedt of a, new
vacancy, concurred in bringing about this fpee-
dy union of fffrages. In order to testify his
refpedi for the memory of Paul III. by whom
he had been created Cardinal, as wvell as his
gratitude to the family of Farnese , he affamed
the name of Paul IV.

His rife and chlara~ter.

The choice of a prelate of fach a fng~ular

charadter, and who had long held a course ex-
tremely diff'erent from that' which urually led to
the dignity now conferred upon him, filled the
Italians, who had nearest access to observe his
manners and deportment, with astonishment,
and k~ept them in furpenfe and solicitude with
regard to his future conded. Paul, though
born in a rankr of life which, without any other
merit , might have secured to him the highest
ecclesiastical preferments, had,' from his early
years, applied to Rady with all the afirduity of
a man who had'nothinlg but his personal accom-
plithments to render him conspicuous. By
means of this, he not only acquired profound:
fkrill in feholaftick theology, but added to that
a considerable knowledge of the learned langua-
ges and of polite literature , the Rtudy of which
had been lately revived in Italy , and was pur-
sured at this time with great ardour. His mind,
however , naturally gloomy and severe, was
more formed to imbibe the four spirit of the
former, than to receive any tin~ture of elegance
or liberality of sentiment from the latter; so that:
he acquired rather the qualities and pafflons of
a reclar~e ecclefia~ick, than the talents neceffa;-
ry for the condua of great affairs. Accordingly,
when he entered into orders, although s~everal
rich benefices were betosyed upon him, and
he was early employed as nuncio in different:

courts , he soon became diifgufked wvith that
course of life, and languished to be in a litua;
tion more faited to his takte and temper. With
this view, he resigned at once all hi; ecclefi~a'f-
tical pre ferme~nts, and having infkituterdan order
of regular priests, whom he denominated Theaa
tines, from the name of the archbifhoprick which
he had held, he allociated himself as a member
of their fraternity, confbrmed to all the rigor-
ous rules to which he had fubjeated them, and
Ipreferred the solitude of a monaftick life, with
the honour of being the founder of a new order,
to all the vast objeats which the court of Rome
prefeated to his ambition.

The first iteps of his adminiktration.

In this retreat he remained for marty years

until Paul III. induced by the fame of his fanc-
tity and knowledge, called him to Rome , in
order to consult with him concerning the mea-
fures, which might be most proper and effeatual
for the fuppreiling of heresy, and re-establish-
Ing the ancient authority of the church. Hay-
i3ng thus allured him from his s~olitude , the
Pope, partly by his entreaties, and partly by
his authority, prevailed on him to accept of a
Cardinal's hat, to re-affame the benefices which
he had resig~ned, and to return again into the
xifual path of ecclesiastical ambition which he
seemed to have relinquished. But, durilg two
facceffive Pontificates, under the first of which

the court: of Rome was the most artful and in;
tereited, and under the second the most dissolute
of any in Europe, Cara~fa retained his monas~-
tick aufferity. He was an avowed and bitter
enemy not only of all innovation in opinion ,
but of every irregularity in pradtice; he was the
chief infirument in eflablithing the formidable
and odious tribunal of the Inquisition in the
papal territories; he appeared a violent advo-
cate on all occallons for the jurifdiaion and~
dis~cipline of the church, and a severe censurer
of every measures which seemed to flow from
motives of policy or interest, rather than front
seal for the honour of the ecclefaiftical order ,
and the dignity of the Holy See, Under a pre.
Inte of fach a charadter, the Roman courtiers
expedted a severe and violent Pontificate , dur-
ing which the principles of found policy would
be s~acrificed to the narrow prejudices ofprieftly
zeal; while the people of Rome were appre-
henfive of feeing the sordid and forbidding
rigour of monaftick manners s~ubstituted in place
of the gaiety or magnificence to which they
had long been accuffomed in the papal court.
There apprehenilons Paul was extremely folici-
tous to remove. At his first entrance upon the
administration, he laid aside that auferity which
had hitherto distinguished his person and family,
and when the marfter of his household inquired
in what manner he would chufe to live , he
hanghtily replied:,, As becomes a great Prince.''

H~e ordered the ceremony of his coronation to
be- condu~ted with~ more than usual magnific-
ence; and etndeavoured to render himfrelf po-
pular by fTeveral ats of liberality and indulgence
towards the inhabitants of Rome. q)

The excess of his attachment to his nephews,

His natural severity of temper, however,

would have soon returned upon him, and would
have juffified the conjedtures of the courtiers,
as well as the fears of the people, if he had
not, immediately after his ele~tion, called to
Rome two of his nephews, the sons of his
brother the Count of Montorio. The eldefl h-e
promoted to be Governor of Rome. The young-
eft, who had hitherto served as a soldier of for-
tune in the armies of Spain or France , and
whole dif'polition as well as manners were flill
rnore foreign from the clerical charadter than
his profei~ion, he created a Cardinal, and ap-
pointed him legate of Bologna , the second
office ·in power and dignity which a Pope can
beffow. Ther~e marks of favour, no less f~ud-
den than extravagant, he accompanied· with the
most unbounded confidence and attachment, and
forgetting all his former severe maxims , he
seemed to hlave no other obje&t than the aggran-
dizing of his nephews.

Their aumbitions .projeas. :

Their ambition , unfortunately for Paul,

-was too aifpiring to be satisfied with any m~ode-
rate acquisition. They had seen the' famtily of
M~edici raised by the intereit of, the Popes of
that house to Supreme power in Tuircany; Paul
III. had, by his abilities and address, secured
thie dutchies of Parrma and Placentia to the fa-
mnily of Farnes~e. They aimed at some effablifh-
ment for themselves, no less confid~eable and
independent; and as they could not ·expeft that
the Pope would carry his indulgence towards
them so far as to secularize any part of the pa-
trimony of the church, they had no profpeat
of attaining what they withed, but by difmem-
bering the Imperial dominions in Italy, in hoDpes.
of seizing some portion of them. This alon~e
they would have deemed a fuffiient reason for
fowmpg the feeds of discord between their uncle
and th e Emperor.

Reasons of their dirguft with the Emp eror.

But Cardinal Caraffa had, besides, private

reas~ons which filled him with hatred and en-
mity to the Emperor. While he served in the
Spanish troops he had not received foch marks
of hon~our and diftin~tion as he thought due to
his birth and merit. Difguffed with this ill-
urage , he had abruptly quitted the Imperial
service; and entering into that of France, he
had not only met with such a reception as sooth-

ed his vanity, and attached him to the French
interest, but by contrad~ing an intimate friend-
th~ip with Strozzi, who commanded the French
army in Tuscany, he had imbibed a mortal an-
tipathy to the Emperor as the great enemy to
the liberty and independence of the Italian Rtates.
Nor was the Pope himself indisposed to receive
imprefftons unfavourable to the Emperor. The
oppositions given to his ele~tion by the Cardi-
nals of the Imperial farition, left in his mind
deep refeatment, which was heightened by the
remembrance of ancient injuries from Charles
or his ministers.

They endeavour to alienate the Pope from the

Emperor.

Of this his nephews took advantage, and

employed various devices, in order to exafpe-
rate him beyond a poilibility of reconciliation.
They aggravated every circurnitance which could
be deemed any indication of the Emperor's dif-
faitisfa~tion w~ith his promotion; they read to
him an intercepted letter, in which Charles
taxed the Cardinals of his party with negligence
or incapacity in not having defeated Paul's elec-
tion; they pretended, at one time, to have
dit'covered a conspiracy formed by the Imperial
miniffer and Cosmo di Mledici against the Pope's
life·; they alarmed him, at another, with ac-
counts -of a plot for affailinating themselves. By
there artifices, they kept his mind, which was

old atge, in fb~chehperptual agitation, as preci-

whose advanced age did not admit of losing a

between Henry and the Pope; that they thould
attack the dutchy of Tuscany and the kingdom
of Naples with their united forces; and if their
arms thould prove faccefsful, that the ancient
republican form of government thould be re-
established in the former, and the invefitutre of
the latter thould be granted to one of the French
King's sons, after reserving at certain territory
which thould be annexed to the patrimony of
the church, together with an independent and
princely eftablilfhment for each of the Pope's
peph ews.

Conflable Montmorency oppoles the alliance with the

Pope.

The King , allared by there s~pecious pro-

je~ts, gave a most favourable audience to the
envoy. But when the matter wvas proposed in
council , the conflacble M;ontmorency , whose
matural caution and averflon to daring enter-
prifes increased with age and experience, re-
rnonfIrated with great vehemence against the
alliance. He put Fenry in mind how fatal to
France every expedition into Italy had been
during three successive reigns, and if foch an
enterprise had proved too great for the nation
even when its firength and finances were entire,
there was no reason to hope for success, if it
thould be attempted now , when both were
exhauffed by extraordinary efforts during wars,
which had latted , with little interruption ,

almoit half a ·centuryp. Hfe reprefeated the ma-
nifeit-imprudence of entering into engagements
with a Pope of fourfoore, as any iyriem which
reited on no better foundation than his life,
muff be extremely precartous , and upon the
event of his death, which could not be diitant,
the face of things, together with the inclina-
tica of the Italian States, muff inffantly change,
and the whole weight of the war be left upon
th-e King alone. To there considerations he
added: the near profpeAt which they now had
of a final accommodation with the Emperor ,
who,· having taken the resolution of retiring
from the world, wis~hed to transmit his king-
domss in peace to his son; and he concluded
with representing the absolute certainty of
drawing the arms of England upon France, if
it thould a/ppear that the re -establishment of
tranquillitfr in Europe was prevented by the
ambition of its Mlonarch.

The Dukre of Guil~e favours it.

There arguments, weighty in thems~elves,

and urged by a miniff~er of great authority ,
w~ould probably have determined the King to
decline any connexion with the Pope. But the
D~uke ,of Guis~e, and his brother the Cardical of
Lorrain , who delighted no les~s in bold and
dangerous undertakings than M~ontmorency
thunned them, declared warmly for an alliance
with ~the Pope. The cardinal expe~ted to be

entrafted' with the condu&t of the negociait~ions
in the court of Romre to which this alliance
would give rife; the drike hoped to. obtain, the
command of the army which would be appoint-
ed to invade Naples; and conftdering themsel-ves
as already in these flations:, vast projeas open-
ed t~o their aspiring and unbounded ambi~tion.~
Their credit , together with th~e influence of
the King's miftrers, the famous Diana of Pbi-
tiers, who was, at that time, entirely devoted
to the interest of the family of Guiire, more
than counterbalanced all Montmorency's prudent
remnonfirances, and prevailed on an inconfide-
rate Prince to listen to the overtures of the
Pope's envoy.

Cardinal of Lorrain sent to negociate with the Pope.

The cardinal of Lorrain, as he had expedt-

ed, was immediately feat to Rome with full
powers to conclude the treaty, and to concert
meafares for carrying it into execution. Before
he could reach that citjr , the Pope , either
from reflefting on the danger and uncertain
issue of all military operations, or through the
addres~s of the Imperial ambass~ador , who had
been at great: pains to s~oothe him , had not
only begun to 10fe much of thle ardour with
which he had s~et on foot the negociation with
France, but even dis~covered g~reat unwillingner's
to continue it. In order to route hie ~from~
this fit ofdef~pondency, and to rekiindle his

former rage, his nephews had' recourfb to the
arts which they had ·already pradited with so
much success. They alarmed him with new re-
presentations of the Emperor's hostile intentions,
with freth accounts which they had received of
threats wttered against him by the Imperial mi-
niffers, and with new discoveries which they
pretended to have made of conspiracies formed,
and just ready to take effe& against his life.

Paul enraged at the proceedilg~s of the diet of' Augsburg;

But there artifices, having been formerly

tried., would not have operated a s~econd time
with the fame force, nor have made the im-
preffon which they withed , if Paul had not·
been excited by an offence of that kind which
he was least aible to bear. He received ad-vice
of the recess of the diet of AugsbUrg, and of
the toleration which was thereby granted to
the Protestants , and this threw him at once
into fuzch transports of paflton againfit the Em-
peror and IBing of the Romans, as carried him
headlong into all the violent meaiiares of his
nephews. Fall of high ide'as with refpedt to
the papal prerogative, and animated with the
fiercest: zeal against heresy·, he confxdered the
liberty of deciding concerning religious matters,
which had been assumed by an assembly com-
posed chiefly of laymen , as a prefamptuous
and unpardonable encroachment on that jurif.
dition which belonged to hinx alone; and re-

garded the indulgence which had been given to
the Proteffants as an impious at? of that power
Swhi~ch the diet had usurped. He complained

loudly of both to the Imperial ambassador. He
insisted that the recers of the diet thould im-
mediately be declared illegal and void. He
threatened the Emperor and King of the Ro-
m~ans, in cafe they thould either refuse or delay
to gratify him in this particular , with the
severest effe~ts of his vengeance. He talked
in a tone of authority and command which
might have faited a pontif of the twelfth cen-
tury , when a papal decree was f~ufficient to
have thaken, or to have overturned, the throne
of the greatest Monarch; but which was alto-
gether improper in that age , especially when
addressed to the miniffer of a Prince who had
so often made pontifs more formidable feel the
weight of his power. The ambassador, how-
ever, heard all his extravagant propositions and
snenaces with much patience, and endeavoured
to soothe him, by putting him in mind of the
extreme diffrefs to which the Emperor was
red aced at Inf'pruck, of the engagements wlhich
he had come under to the Proteffants in order
to extricate himself, of the neceirty of fulfilling
there , and of accommodating his conduat to
the fittlation of his alffairs. B3ut wreighty as
there considerations were, they made no im-
prefRon on the mind of the haughty and bigoted
gontif, who instantly replied. That he would

those impious engagements, and even command
him not to perfor a them; that in carry~ing bn
the cause of God ·and of the ch arch , no regard
ou~ght to be had to the marxims of worldly pro-
dence and policy ; anrd that ~the ill iFuccefs of
the Emperor's schemeS in Germany might juffcly
be deemed a mark of the diviEne difipleaifare
against him, on account of his having paid little
attention to th~e former, while he regulated his
condu~t entirely by the latter. Having said
this, he turned from the almbaffador abruptly
without waiting for a reply.

His nephews took care to applaud an~d che-

rifh these fentimnents, and easily wrought' up
his arrogant mind, fraught with all~the monkith
ideas concerning the exten~t of the papal fupre-
macy, to s~uch a pitch of refentmrent against the
hoof~e of Auffria, and to sauch an high opinion
of his own· p"bwer, that he tal~ked continually
of his being the facceifor of thos~e wivho had d e-~
posed Kings and Emperor's; that he was exv-
alted as head over them all, and wouldc~ trample

In this disposition , the cardinal -of Lorrain

found the Pope, and easily pers~uaded him to
sign a treaty, (D~ec. rS. r555.1 w~hich had for

The Emnperor refohres -to refigrn his hereditary dominions.

During the- negociation of this treaty at

Rome and Paris , an. event happened which
seemed render the fears which had given rif~e
to it vain , and the operations which were to
follow upon it unn~ecefflary. This wras the Em-
peror's resignation .of his hereditary dominions
to his son Philip; together with his resolution
to withdraw entirely fr~om any concern in bu-
finefs or the affairs of this world, in order that:
he might spend the remainder of his days in
retirement and s~olitude. Though it requires
neither deep refle~tion nor extraordinary dif-
cernment to discover that the slate of royalty
is not exempt from cares and disa8ppointment;
though most of those who are exalted to a
throne find solicitude, and fattiety, and difgaft
to be their perpetual attendants in that envied
pre-eminence, yet, to descend voluntarily from

The motives of Lthis refigntaticrt.

No wonder, then, that Chirles's refigna-

tion thould fill all Europe with affonifhment,
and give rife, both among his contemporaries,
and among the historians of that period, to va-
rious conjeaur~es concerning the motives which
determine~d a Pri~nce, whose ruling pairon had
been uniformly the love of power, at the age
of fifty-fix, when obje~ts of ambition operate
with full force on the mind, and are pursued
with the gr~eatest ardour, to ta~e a resolution

i'o firigular and unexpedted. But while many
authorl have imputed it to miotives To frivolous
and fantastical, as can hardly be supposed .to
influence any reasonable mind; while others
have imagined it to be the treu~lt of fomae pro-
found scheme of policy; hifterians! more intel-
ligent, and better informed, neither aferibe it·
to ca rice, rior s~earch mysterio~us feocrets of itate,
where simple and obvious causes will fully
account~for the Emperor's conda&B. Charles had-
been attacked early in life with the gout, and
ixotwithftanding· all the precautions o'f the meft
skilful physicians, the violence of the distemper
increased as he advanced in age, and the Ifits
became every year more frequent, as well as
mnore iritolerable. Not only was the vigour oof'
his confitattion broken , but the faculties of his
mind were impaired by the excruciating tor-
ments which he endured. Dursing ·the conti-
nuance of the fits, he was altogether incapab~le
of applying to business , and even when they
began to abate, as it was only at intervals that;
he could attend to what was serious, he gave
up a great part of his` time to triflinrg and e-ven
childith occupations, which ferr ed to relieve or
to amdek his mnind, enfe~ebled and ~worn out
with e'xcefs of pain. Under ther~e circumitances,
the condukt of farch affairs as occurred of courfCe,
is governing fo' many kingdom~s, was a buirden
more thari f~udicient; but to path forward- and
comp.lete thre vast Sichemes, which th-e amb~~~RRRR~~~iRt·ioBn-

in :,view and.carry on the fame great System of
poli-cy, extending to every nation in Europe,
ad colnne~te with the operations of every dif-
ferent court , were fun~tions which so far ex-
ceeeded .his - freng~th, that they oppreffekd and
ovesrwhelmed his mind. As he had been long
a~ccaffomed .to vuiew the bufinei's of every de-
par~tment, whether civil, or military, or eccle-
haftical u with his own eyes, and to decide con-
ecning it according to, his own id~eas, it gave
him ·the utsmofit pain when he felt his infirmi-
ties incr~ease to fast upon him, that he was
bldiged to commit the conduR of all affairs to
his exninifters.- He imp~uted every misfortune
w~hich befel him, and every mil'carriage tha't
happened, even wrhen the former was unavoid-
able· and the latter accidental , to his inability
to. takre the infpenion of business himself. He
complained of his hard fortune, in being oppof-
ed, in his declining years, to a rival, who
was ini the full vigour of life, and that while
Henry could take and execute all his resolutions
in person, he thould now be reduced, both in
council and in adtion , to rely on the abilities
of other men. Having thus grown old before
his time, he wifely judged it more decent to
conceal his ·infirmi~ties i oefltdta
to expos~e them any longer to the publick eye;
andl prudently determined not to forfeit the
frame, or lose the acquilitions of his better years,

by firuggling, with a vain. obstinacy , to retain
the reins of governmnent, when he was no longer
able to hold them with fteadinels, or to guide
them with addref's. *)

But though Charles had revolved this f~cherne

in his mind for several years, and had commu-

Says, that, the Emperor having ceded the government of
the kingdom of N'aples and the dutchy of IMilan to his
son , upon his marriage with the Queen of England~; Philip,
notwithstanding the advice and intreaties of his father, re-
movedt most of the mniniff-ers- and offcers whom he had
employed inl thafe countries , and appointed creatures of
his own , to fill the places which they held. That h-e
aspired openly , and with little delicacy , to obtain a Chare
in the adminiltration of affairs in the Low Countries. That

to limit his authority , behaving towards him fomterimes
with inlattention, and sometimes with hanghtin'efs. Th~at~
Charles finding that he ruit either yield to his son , or

were both dis~agreeable and mnartifying to a father, he took
the refolrltion of CeFigning his crowns , and of retiring from
the world , vol. i. p. 24, &c. D~om Levefque derived his in-
formation concefningf these curious fac~s which he relates
very briefly , from the original papers of cardinal Gran4
velle. But as that vast colleffion o~f papers, w'hich has
been preserved and arrangecd by M. L'Abbe' Boizot of
Befangon , though one of the most· valu~able historical
monuments of the sixteenth ceutury , and which cannot
fail of throwing much light on the tranfa~ions of Char-

gree of credit fbould be given to this account of Char-

in relating this event.

rticated it to his; iaers the d'owager Queens of
France and Hungary, who not, only a~pproved'
of his intention , but offered to accompany him
to whatever place of retreat he thould chule;
fCeveral things had hitherto prevented his carry-
ing it into execution. He could not think of
loading his son with the government of~ foiany
kingdoms, until he t~hould attain fach maturity
of age, and of abilities, as would enable him
to sustain that weighty burden. But as Philip
had now reac~hed his twenty-eighth year, and
had been early accuitomed to byfinefs, for
which he dis~covered both inclination and capa-
cityJ it can hardly bie httputed to the partiality
of paternal~aff'eeionI, that his -scruples, with
regard to this point, were entirely removed;
and that he thought he might place him without
further heit~atish' or delay, on the throne which
he was about tos aibandon. 11 is mother's fitua-
tion had been another obitra~tion in his way.
For although she had continued alonoft fifty
years in confinement, and under the fame dif~-
order of miind which concer~n for hier hufband's
death had brought upon her, yet the govern-
anent of Spain was still vefited in her joiixtly
with the EImperor; her name was inserted to-
gether with his in all the publick writs ifrued
in that kitigdom; aird fauchi vas the fond attach-
ment of the Spaniards to her, that ·theyi would
pr~obably have focrupled to reco~gtirat Philip as:
their fevereign, unless the had codiented to

assume him as her partner on the throne. Her
utter incapacity for bufiners rendered it impoF-
fible to obtain her content. But her death,
which happened this year, remuoved this difR-f
culty; and as C~harles, upon' that event, b~e·-
came sole Monarch of Spain , it left the factef-
sion open his to son. The war with France had
likewise been a reason for retaining the admi-
nifkration of affairs in his· owrn hand, as he wcas
extremely solicitous to have terminated it, that
he might ha~ve given up his kingdomrs to his son
at peace with all the world. But as Henry had
discovered no disposition toi close with any
of his overtures, and had even rejeated prop~o-
fals of peace, iwhich were equal and moderate,
in a tone that s~eemed to indicate a ~fixed purl
pole of continuting boftilities, he saw that it
wtas vain to wait longer in exrpe~tation of an
event, which , however d~eftrable , was alto-
gether uncertains.

The formnalities w~ith wlhich he ektecute'd it.

As this , then, arppeared to be the piroper

junafure for ex ec #lting t~he feheme which he had
long meditarted, C~harles resolved to resig~n his
kin~dorms to 4is son, with a folemnrity fait~able
to the importance of the tranfa~tion, and to
perform this ]aft: at of or~-eceignty wuith fachl
formal pomp , As inight leave a latiring knprel'-
sion on the mtiti~ds ·rot onlyt of his fabjects but~

of his fucoeffor. WI~ith this view he called
Philip out of England, wnhere the peevish tem-
per of his Queen, which increas~ed with her
despair of having ifl~ue, rendered him extreme-
ly unhappy * and the jealousy of the Englis~h
left him no hopes of obtaining the dire~iion of
their affairs. Having assembled the States of
the Low Countries at Bru~fels, on the twenty-
fifth of O~tober,: Charles f'eated hims~elf, for the
last time, in the chair of state, on one fide of
which was placed his fTon, and on the other
his fiffer the Queen of.Hungary, regent of the
Net~herlands, with. a splendid retinue of the
grandees of Spain and princes of the Empire
Hlanding- behind him. The president of the
council of Slanders, by his command, explain-
ed, in a few words, .his intention in calling this
extraordinary meeting of the States. He then
read the instrument of resignation , by which
Charles fuxrrendered to his s~on Philip all his
territories, jurif'diRion, and authority in the
Low Countries, absolving his faubjeats there
from their oath of allegian~ce to him, which he
required them to transfer to Philip his lawful
heir, and to serve him with the fame loyalty
and zeal which they had manifested , during
to lonlg a course of years, in support of his
government.

Charles then refe from his feat, and leaning

on the thoulder of the Prince of Orange , be-
cause he was unable to ft and without· support ,

he addreifed hims~elf to the audience, and from
a paper which he held in his hand , in order to
a~if~t his memory , he recounted , with dignity,
but wcithout ostentation, all the great things
which he had undertaken and performed since
the commencement of his adminis~tration. He
observed, that from the s~eventeen~th year of his
age, he had dedicated all his thoughts and at-
tention to publick objeats, reserving no portion
of his time for the indulgence of his ease , and
very little for the enjoyment of private pleafare;
that either in a pacifick or hofti'le manner, he
-had visited Germany nine times, Spain fix times,
France four times, Italy seven times, the Low
Countries ten times, England twice, Africa as
often, and had made eleven. voyages by sea;
that while his health permitted him to discharge
his duty , and the vigour of his conflitation
was equal, in any degree, to the arduous
office of governing fach extensive dominions,
he had never thunned jlabour, nor repined under
fattigue; that now w-hen his health w-as broken,
and his vigour exhausted by the rage of an in-
curable d~ifemper, his growing infirmities ad-
monifhed him to retire, nor was he t'o fond of
reigning, as to retain the feceptre in an im-
potent hand, which was no longer able to pro-
te&t his fubjerts , or to render them happy; that
inflead of a s~overeig~n worn out with dil~eafes,
and fearcely half alive, he gave them one in
the prime of life, accuffomed already to govern

iind who addied: to the vigour of youth all the
attention and sagacity of maturer years; that
if,` dur~ing· the `course of a long adth~iniffration,
he had committed any material e~tror in govern--
men~t, or if,~ under the pressure of so many and.
great affairs, and~ amlidt the attention which he
had been obliged to give to thern, he had eithet
regrle~ted or injured any of his f~ubjeas, he now
idi~ptored their' ·forgiveneirs; that,' for bis part,

he hoiuld eirer retain a grateful sense of their

fidelity and attachment, and would carry the
r~membrance of it a long with him to the place
of his r~etrieat, as his s~weetest consolation, as
well as the best reward for all his services, and
in his lefit prayers to Almighty God would pour
forcth his ardenit wishes for their wcelfare.

Then turning towards Philip, who fell on

his knees an'd kissed his father's hand:,, If ,
says he, I had left you by my death this rich
Inh'eritance, to which I have made such larg~e
additions, some regard would have been juffly
duie to my memory on that account; b~ut now
w~hen I voluntarily resign to you what I might
havfe f~ill retained, I may well expedt the
warmest expreffxons of thanks on your pse~t.

va;te life , may you have a son endowed with

the ceremony of resignation happened, and he. was pre-
sent at: the trad~aftion, vol. ii. p. 592. Godlevens, who
publithed a treatise de Abdicatione Caroli V. fixes the pu-

But it was no eafyl matter to reconcile such a

The Conflable Montmqorency, however, repre-
fTeated in such a fbriking light, the imprud~ence
of sacrificing the true interests of his kringdom
to there rash obliga~tions, and tookr suc-h advan-
tage of the absence of the Cardinal of Lorrain,

advice last given him, authorized his ambaffa-
dors to ig~n (5th Feb. 1556·.)a treaty of truce
with the Emperor for five years, on the terms
which had been pr~oposed. But that he might
not seem to have altogether forgotten his ally

think that Henry could forget to soon, or vio-

preceding negociations , would terminate in
nothing. But later and more certain intelli-
gence soon convinced him that iri political affairs
to reasoning is more fallacious , than, because~
an event is improbable , to co~nclude that it
will not happen. ·The s~udden and unexpefted
conelufion of the truce filled Paiul wjith affonifb-
ment and terror. The Cardinal of Loreriin diurit·
not encounter that florm of indignation , to
which he knew that he thould be exposed front
the haiughity Pontif, who had so good~ r~esil
to be iteenfed ; but departing~ abruptly from
kome , he left to the Cardinal Tournoii the
difficult talk of attempting to soothe Paul and
his nephews. They were fully fehfible of the
perilous situation in wrhich they now flood. By
' their eng~agements with France , which wvere
no longer fewret , they had highly irritated
Phlilip. They dreaded the violence of his im-
placable temper. The Duke ofAlva, a miiniffer
fitted, as well byi his abilities as byz the feve-
rity of his nature , for executing all Philip's
figorotis s~chemes, had advanced from RIVilan to
Naples, and began to assemble troops on the
frontiers of the Ecclesiastical State. While
'they, if deserted by France, na~uff not only re-
linquifh all the hopes of dominion and fover-
eighty to wrhich their ambition aspired , but
remain expo~sed to the resentment of the Spanish
monarch , without one ally to prote~t them

bgainft an enem~y with whom they were to
l-ittle able to contend.

He attempts to rekindler the war.

Under ther'e circumfftances , Paul had re-

course to the arts of ne~gociation and intrigue,
of which the Papal court knows hows well, to
~avail itself in order to ward off any calamity
threatened by an enemy superi~or in power. He
affe~ted to approve highly of the tralce, as~ an
hiappy expedient for putting a thp to the effu-
Rion of Christian blood. He exprieffed his ws~armed
wxithes that it migh~t provie the forerttnaner of a
definitive peace. He exhorted the r~ivra Priic~es
to embrace this favourable op~porntnity of s~etting
-on foot a negociation for that purpose, and of.
Fered, as their common father, to, be mediator
betwieen them. Under th~is pretext , he ap-
poinlted Cardinal Rebiba his nun-cio to the court
of Braffeis , and his neph~ew Cardinal Caraffa
to that of Paris. The publick iainfktrtions giten,
to both were the f~ame; that they thould afe
their atmoft endeevours to prevail with the two
moinalrchs toi acc~ept of ;the Pope's inediaition ,
that, by mea~ns: of it, peace thig~b~b~bfbfht be reditaf-
btlithe~d, and thleatures might be fat3en for Ar-
fthablintg a genijral icouncil. Bu~t under this
(pecious appearance of real fai* dttthihiig ob~jeas
to desirable in themselves, and t'o becoming his
sacred chara~ter to perfue, Paul concealed very
rdifferent intentions. Caraffa, besides his publick

Q2

infiru~tio~s, received a private commiffon to
solicit the French King to renounce the treaty
of truce, and to renew his eng~agemnents with
the Holy See: and he was empowered to spare
neither entreaties, nor promises, nor bribes ,
in order to gain that point. This, both the
uncle and the nephew considered as the real
end of the embassy; while the other fCerved to
amule the vulgar, or to deceive the Emperor
and his son. 'The Cardinal, accordingly, set
out instantly (1 ath May. I556.) for Paris, and
.travelled with the greateRt expedition, while
.Rebiba was detained some weeks at Rome; and
when it became necessary for hirix te begin his
.journey, he received secret orders to protradt
it; as. much as pofirble , that the issue of Caraf-
fa's negaciation might be known before he
thould reach Bru~fels, and .according to that,
proper dire~tions might be given to him with
regard to the tone which he thould assume, in
treating with the Einperor and his son. z)

H'is neg~ociations for that purpore.

Caraffa made his entry into Paris with ex-

traordinary pomp; and having presented a con-
fecrated -sword to Henry, as the Prote~or, on
. whose aid the Pope relied in the prefeat exi-
.gency, he besought him not to disregard the

asol

entreaties of a parent: in distress, but to employ
that weapon which he gave him in his defence;
This he represented not only as a duty of filial
piety, but as an ass of juffice. As the Pope,
fl-om confidence in the assistance and support
which his late treaty with France entitled him
to exupe&t, had taken fach iteps as had irritated
the King of Spain, he conjured Henry not to
fuffer Paul and his family t'o be crushed under
the weight of that resentment which they had
drawn on themselves mierely by their attachment
to France. Together with this argument ad-
dressed to his generof ity , he employed another
which he hoped wioulld work on his ambition.
Hle affirmed that now was the time, when ,
stith the mo~t· certain prof'pedt of success, he
might attack Philip's dominions in Italy; that
the flower· of the veteran Spanish bands had
perished in the wars of Hungary , Germany,
and the Low Countries; that the Emperor ·had
left his son an exhauffed treasury, and king~-
doms drained of men; that he had no longer
·to contend with the abilities, the experience,
and good fortulne of Charles, but with a mo-
narch fearcely seated on his throne , unpraffif-
ed in command, odious to many of the Italian
Itates, and dreaded by alL, He promised that
the Pope , who had already levied soldiers ,
wo~uld bring a conflderable army into the field ,
which, when joined by a fufficient number of
French troops, might, by one brisk and furdden

effort, drive the Spaniards out of Naples, and
add to the ~crowP 'of Frapee a kingdom , the
conquest of wvhich had been the great obje&a of
all his pred~eeffors during half a century, and
the chief motive of all their exped~itions i~n-
to Italy.

'Their effea.

Every: word3 Caraffas ty~ok# made deep imE-

pre~flion on, Henry; i opfio~us·, en.the one hand,
that the Pope had jus paure to repro~ach~ him
grith having v~iolated ~the. lawss not only of ge-·
nerefity buit of decepcy , wIhen he renounced
his league with him, aod had agreed to the
truce of Vaucelles; and eager, on the other
hand , not only to djifkinguifb his reign by a
conqueit, which three former magarch$ h4 .at-
tempted, withogr facef4s, bu-t likewtif~e to ac-
quire an attablithment~~nt of thch dignity and value:
iFor one 'of his Cons. Reveyenge, hywvever, for
the oath, by wyhich he had to lately confirmed
the truzce of V~ancelles; Ithe extreme old ag~e of
the Polpe, whose death might occat-os an entire
revolution in the political system ofltaly; to-
gqther with the repredhentations of Montmoren-
cy, who repeated a~ll he arglramentns he h;Fd
used againh the: first lege fs~withL Paul, and
pointed out the great and ignmediate advantagyp
whl~ich France 8erived from the ·trae; kep~t
H~enry far fasme time in lfutpepce, and might
poflably have o~utweighed all Caraffa's arge-

rnents. B~ut the Cardinal was not fach a novice
in the arts of intrigue and negociation, as not
to have expedients ready for removing or faur-
anounting all there obstacles. To obviate the
King's ikrutple with regard to his oath, he pro-
.duced powers from the Pope to absolve him
from the obligation of it. By way of s~ecurity
against any: danger which he might apprehend
from the Popie's death, he engaged that his
uncle would rn~ake su~ch a nomination of Car-
dinals , as thould give Henry the absolute com-
mnand of the next eleftion, and enable hi~m to
place in the Papal ch~air a perfost entirely de-
yoted to his intere!t.

In order to counterbalance the effe~r of the

Conftable's opinion and influence , he employed
no0t only the active talents of the Duke of Guire,
and the eloquence of his brother the Cardinal
of Lorrain , but the address of the Queen,
aided by the more powerful arts of Diana of
Poitiers, wh~o, unfortunately for France, co-
operated with Catharine in this point, though
the took pleas~ure, on almofte every other occa-
sion, to thwart and mortify her. They, by
their united folicitations, easily fwvayed the
King , who leaned, of his own accord, to that
fide towards which they wifhled him to incline.
All Montmorency's prudent remon~trances were
---ifregarded; the nuncio ablolved Henry from

bis oath i and he figrned a ?new league w·ith the

Pope, which rekindled the flames of war both
in Italy and in the Low Countries.

The Pope's violent proceedings againit Ph~ilip.

As soon as Paull was informed by his nephew

that there was a fair profpe~t of his faucceeding in
this neg~ociation, he dispatched (July 3r. I556.·)
a messenger after the nuncio Rebiba, with orders
to return to Romne, without proceeding to
Brussels. As it was now no longer necessary
to pres~erve that tone of moderation, which
faited the charader of a mediator , and which
lie had affe~ted to assume, or to put any farther
reffraint u on his rese~ntment: against Philip, he
boldly threw off the mafkr, and tookr such
violent fieps as rendered a rupture unavoidable.
He seized and imprisoned the Spanish envroy at
his court. Hre excommunicated the Colonnas;
and having deprived Mark Antonio, the head
of that family , of the Dukedom of Paliano, he
granted that dignity, together with the terri-
gory annexed to it, to his nephew the Count
of ]Montorio. He ordered a legal information
to be presented in the confiffory of Cardinals
against Philip, setting forth that he notwith-
standing~ the fidelity and allegiance due by him
to the Holy See, of which he held the crown
of Naples, had not only afforded a retreat in
hiis dominions to the Colonnas, whom the Pope
h~ad excommunicated and declared rebels, but

had furnished them with arms, and was ready,
in conjun £6ion with thlem, to inv~ade the Eccle-
fla~tical State- in an hortile manner; that foch
condu~t in a1 vassal w~as to be deemed treason
against his liege lord, the punishment of which
was the forfeiture of his fief. Upon this the
confiltorial advocate requested the Pope to take
cognizance of the cau~e , and to appoint a day
for hearing of it, when he would make good
every article of the charge, and expe~t from
his justice that sentence which the heinoufneifs
of Philip's crimes merited. Paul, whose pride
was highly flattered with the idea of trying
and passing judgment on to great a King~, *as-
fented ( July 27T. x556.) to his request; and
as if it had been no less easy to execute
than to pronounce sentence , declared that he
would consult with the Cardinals concerning
the formalities requisite in condu~ting the
trial. a)

Philip's fuperltitio~us kcruples.

But while Paul allowed his pride and re-

f~entment to drive him on with such headlong
impetuosity , Philip dis~covered an amazing mo-
deration on his part. H~e had been taught by
the Spanish ecclefiafticks, w~ho had the charge
of his education, a profound veneration for the

a) Pallay. lib. xili. 171.

Holy See. This sentiment , which had been
~early infus~ed, grew up with him; as he advanc-
ed in years, and took full offeilon of his
mind, which was imaturally thoughtful, serious,
and prone to fuperltition. When he forefavr
a rupture with the Pope approaching, he had.
such violent femuples with refpe& to the lawfurl-
neifis of taking arms against the Vicegerent of
Christ, and the common father of all Christians,
thathe consulted some Spanish divines upon that
point. They, with the usual dexterity of ca-
faifits in accommodating their reponfes to the
circumitances of those who apply to them for
d~ire~tion, aff'ured him that, after employing
prayers and remonfirances in order to bring the
Pope to reason, he had full right, both by the
laws of nature and of Christianity, not only to
defend himself when attacked, but` to begin
hof tilities , if that were judged: the most
proper expedient for preventing the effeas of
Paul's violence and injuffice. Philip neverthe-
les~s continued to d~eliberate and delay, confi-
de ring it as a most cruel mis fortun e, that his
administration thould open with an attack on
a person, whose falcred funnion and charadter
he to highly refpe~ted. b)

The Duke of Alva takes the field~ against the pope.

At last the Duke of Alva, who in comnpli-.

ance with his malter's scruples, had continued

b) Ferrer. Hill. d'Efpagnle, ix. 373. Herrera, i. 308.

to negociate long after he thould have begun
to a~t, finding Paul inexorable , and that every
overture of peace , and every appearance of he-
fitation on his part increased the Pontif's na-
tural arrog~ance , took the field and entered
( Sept. 5. x556.) thle ecclesiastical territories.
H~is army did not exueed twelve thousand men,
but it was composed of veteran soldiers, ang
commanded chiefly by those Roman barons,
whom Paul's violence had driven into exile.
The valour of the troops, together with the
animosity of their leaders, who fought in their
own quarrel, and to recover their own estates,
Aupplied the want of numbers. As none of the
French forces were yet arrived, Alva soon be-
came matter of the Campagua Romana; s~ome
cities being s~urrendered through the cow-
ardice of the garrisons, which consisted of raw
soldiers, ill dis~ciplined, and worse commanded;
the gates of others being opened by the in-
habitants , who were eager to receive backr
their ancient masters. Alva, that he migrht
not be taxed with impiety in seizing the pa-
trimon~y of the church , took poffefflon of
the towns which capitulated, in the name of
the college of cardinals, to which, or to
the Pope that thould be chos~en to facceed
Paul, he declared that he would immediately
restore them.,

A'truce between the Pope and Ph ~ip.

The rapid progress of the Spania ,· w7hose

light troops ma~de ~inroads to the gates of
Rome, filled that city with consternation. Paul,
though inflexible and undaunted himself , was
obligred to give way to far to the fears and so-
licitations of the Cardinals, as to fend deputies
to Alva in order to propos~e a cess~ation of arms.
The Pope yielded the more readily, as hel was
sensib~le of a do-ub~le advantage which might be
derived from obtaining that point. It would
deliver the inhabitants of Rome fromn their pre-
sent terror, and would a~fford time fqr the ar--
rivawl of the faccodurs which he expe~ted' from
France. Nor was Alva unwilling to close with
the overture, both as he knew how desirous
his master was to terminate a war, which he
had undertakien with reluftarnce, and as his ar-
my was to much weakened by g-arris~oning the
great number of towns which he had reduced,
that it was hardly in a condition to keep the
field without. fr~esh recruits. A truce was ac-
cording~ly conclulded (Nov. 19. r556.) first for
ten , and afterwards for forty days , duzring
which, various s~chemes of peace were proposed,
and perpetual negociations were carried on, but
with no sincerity on the part of the Pope. The
return of his nephew the Cardinal to Rome,
the receipt of a considerable falm remitted by
the King of France , the arrival of one body of

French troops, together with the expe~tation of
others which had began their march, rendered
him more arrogant than ever, and banit~hed all
thoughts from his mind, but thlof'e of war and
revenge. c)

Empir6.

WHILEB thdf'e operations or intrigues kept

the Pope -and Philip blify and attentive , the
Emperor disentangled himse~lf finally from alll
the affairs of this wobrld, iad set out for thie
place of his retreat. He had hiitherto retained
the Imperial dignity, not from any rinwilling..
nefrs to relinquif'h it, for, after having resigned
the real aind extensive authority that he enjoyed
in his heredi~tory dominions, to part with the
limited and often ideal jurifdialion which be-
lengs to an eleaive crown, viras no great fagcri-
fice. His sole motiv~e for delay was to gain a
fear months , for makring one trial more , in

order to accomnpifh his faviourite s~cheme in be:-
half of his foni. At the very time Charled'
fCeemed to be moit sensible of the vanity of
worldly grandeur , anbd when he appeared to
be quitting it not only with indifference, bdtt
wkith contempt, the vidt schemes of ambition,
which had to long occupied and engrossed his
mjind, flill kept poffefflonl of it. He could not
thin'k of leaving· his fdn in a rank inferior td'
that which he himself had held among the:
Princes of Europe. As he had , some years
before, made a fruitless attempt to secure the
Imperial crown to Philip, th~at bp uniting it to
the kingdoms of Spain, and the dominions as
the houf'e of Burgundy, he might put it in his
p~ower to pro~e~cute, with: a better pirofped4 of
fa~ccefs, those great planis, wrhich~ his own in--
firniities had obliged him to abandon, he was
still unwilling to relinqulfh this flattering pro,
ject as chime'rical or una~ttainable.

Which proves unfuccefsful.

Notwithffanding the repulse which he had

formerly met with from his .brother Ferdinand,
he renewed his folicitaitions with freifh importuc
nity; and during the summer, had tii~ed every
art, and employed every argument, which he
thought could induce him to quit the Imperial
throne to Philip, and to accept of the inveffi-
ture of s~ome province , either in Italy, or in

the Low Countries, as an equivalent. a) But
Ferdinand, who was to firm and inflexible with
regard to this point, that he had paid no regard
to the folicitations of the Emperor, even when
they were enforced with all the weight of
authority which accompanies s~upreme power,
received the overture, that now came from him
in the situation to which he had des~cended ,
with greater indifference , and would hardly
deign to listen to it. Charles, athamed of his
own credulity in having imagined that: he might
accomplish that now , which he had attempted
formerly without fascef~s, defifted finally from
his scheme. He then resigned the government
of the Empire, and having transferred all his
claims of obedience and allegiance from the
Germanick body , to his brother the King of
the Romans, he executed (August 27. 1556.)
a deed to that effed , with~ all the formali~-
ties requisite in fuzch an important tranfac-
tion. The infirument of resignation he com-
mitted to William Prince of Orange, and em-
powered him to lay it before the college of

Charles sets out for Spain.

NTothing now remained to detain Charles

from that retreat for which he languished. The
preparations for his voyage having been made
for some time, hie set out for Zuitburg in Zee-
land, where the fleet had orders to rendezvous.
In his way thither he paired through Ghent,
and after Ropping there a few days, to indulge
that tender and pleafagnt melancholy , which
arises in the mind of every man in the decline
of life , on vifxting the place of his nativity,
and viewing the scenes and objefts familiar to
him in his early youth, he pursued his journey,
accompanied by his son Philip , his daughter
the archduchess, his fifiers the dowager Queens
of France and Hungary, Mcaximilian his fon-in-
law , and a numerous retinue of the Flemith
nobility. Before he went on board , he dif-
mirf~ed them ·, with marks of his attention or
regard, and ta~king leave of Philip with all the
tenderner~s of a father who embraced his s~on
f~or the last: time, he s~et fiail on the freventeenth
of September, under convoy of a large fleet of
Spanish, Flemith, and English thips, He de-
clined a pressing invitation, from the Queen of
England, to land in some part of her dominions,
in order to refresh himself, and that The might
h~ave the comfort of feeing him once more. It

Queen to receive a vifxt from a father-in-,

law, who is now nothing more than a private
gentleman .

Hisl arrival and reception there.

His voyage was prosperous, and he arrived

at Laredo in Bircay on the eleventh day after
he left Zeeland. As soon as he landed , he
fell proffrate on the ground; and considering
himself now as dead to the world, he kifeld
the earth, and said: ,, Naked came I out of
my mo~ther's womb, and naked I now return
to thee, thou ,common mother of mankind. "C
From Laredo he pursued his journey to Burgos,
carried' by his attendants fometimnes in a chair,

Sand sometimes in a horse litter, f~uffering ex-

quifxte pain at every skep , and advancing with
the greatest difficulty. Some of the Spanith
nobility repaired to Burgos, in order to pay
court to him, but they were so few in num-
ber , and their attendance was to negligent ,
that Charles observed it, and felt , for the first
time, that he was no longer a Monarch. Ac-
cuftomed from his early youth to the dutiful
and officious refpedt with which those who
poffers sovereign power are attended , he had
received it with the credulity common to Prin-
ces , and was weak enough to be mortified,
when he now discovered , that he had been
indebted to 'his fortune for much of that obfe-
quious regard which he had fondly thought
was paid to his pers~onal qualities. But though

he might have soon learned to forget the levity
of his frubjeats, or to have despised their ne-
gled , he was more deeply affii~ed with his
fon's ingratitude, who, forgetting already how
much he owed to his father's bounty, obliged
him to remain some weeks at Burgos, before
he paid him the firlt moiety of that small pen-
sion, which was all that he had reserved of so
many kingdoms. As without this fum, Charles
could not dismiss his domefticks with s~uch re-
wards as their services merited , or his genero-
fity had deffined for them, he could not help
expres~sing both furprize and diffatisfa~tion. c)
At last: the money was paid, and Charles hav-
ing dismissed a great number of his domefficks,
whose attendance he thought would be s~uper-
fluous or cumbersome in his retirement , he
proceeded to Valladolid. There he took a last
and tender leave of his two fiffers, whom he
would not permit to accompany him to his s~o-
litude , though they entreated it with tears,
not only that they might have the cons~olation
of contributing by their attendance and care to
mitigate or to sooth his f'uff~erings, but that
they might reap infkrudtion and benefit by join-
ing with him in those pious exercises , to
which he had consecrated the remainder of
h-is days.

Th~e place of his retreat.

From Valladolid he continued his journey

to Plazencia in Effremnadura. He had passed
through this place a great many years before,
and having5 been firurck at that time with the
delightful situation of the monastery ofS. Juflus,
belonging to the order of St. Jerome, not many
miles diffant from the town, he had then ob-
s~erved to some of his attendants, that this was
n spot to which Diocletian might have retired
with pleafare. The imprefiron had remained
to firong on his mind, that he pitched upon it
as the place of hit retreat. It was sea ted in a
vale of no great extent, watered by a small
brook, and surrounded by rifinlg grounds ,
covered with lofty trees; from the nature of
the fail, as well as the temperature of the
climate, it was esteemed the most healthful
and delicious situation in Spain. Some months
before his resignation he had s~ent an architedt
thither, to add a new apartment to the monar-
tery, for his accommodation; but he gave firiB
orders that the flyle of the building thould be
luzch as fauited his prefeat Rtation, rather than
his former dignity. It conftified only of fix
rooms, four of them in the form of Friars cells,
with naked walls; the other two, each twenty
feet s~quare, were hung with brown cloth, and
furni~shed in the mos1 simple manner. They
were all on a level withl the ground; with a
door on one fide into a garden, of which Char-

les himself had given the plan, and had filled
it with various plants, which he intended to
cultivate with his own hands. On the other
fide they communicated with the chapel of the
monastery, in which he was to perform his de-
votions. Into this humble retreat, hardly iufai-
clent for the comfortable accommodation of a
private gentleman , did Charles enter, (Feb.
24. '557.) with twelve domeftic~ks only. He
buried there, in solitude and illence , his
grandeur, his ambition, together with a~llthofe
vast projeats, which, during half a century ,
had alarmed and agitated Europe, filling every
k~ingdom in it , by turns, with the terror of
his arms, and the dread of being fubjedted to
his power. d)

Contratt between the behaviour of Charles and the Pope.

T6he. contrast between Charles's conduR iand

that of the Pope at this junature, was to ob-
vious, that it fkruck even the most careles~s ob-
servers; nor was the comparison which they
made much to Paul's advantage. The former,
a conqueror, born to reign, long accustomed
to the s~plendor which accompanies supreme
power , and to those busy and intereffing s~cenes:
in which an adtive ambition had engaged him,
quitted the world at an early period of life, that

he might: close the evening of his days in tran-.
quillity, and s~ecure some interval for sober
thought, and s~erious recolle~tion. The latter,
a priest, who had passed the early part of his
life in the shade of the s~chools, and in the
ffudy of the s~peculative s~cience,. who was
·seemingly to detached from the world, that he
had t~hat himself up for many years in the soli-
tude of a cloyfier , and who was not raised to
the papal throne until he had reached the ex-
tremity of old age, discovered at once all the
impetuosity of youthful ambition , and engaged
in vast schemes;, in order to accomplish which;
he s~crupled not to frcatter the feeds of discord,
Sand to kindle the flames of war, in every
corner of Europe. But Paul, regardlef's of the
opinion or cedfures of mankind, held on his
own course with his wonted arrogance and vio-
. ence. There, althoug~h they seemed already
to have exceeded all bounds , rose to still a
greater height, upon the arrival of the duke
of G uif~e in Italy.

The duke of Guise leads the French army into Italy.

That which the two Princes of Lorrain fore-

f~ar an~d de~sired , had happened. The duk~e of
Guise was entruffed with the command of the
army appointed to march to the Pope's afiffiiance.
It codifited of twenty thousand men , of the
best troops in the s~ervice of France. So high

was the Duke's reputation, and fazch the ge-
neral expe~tation of beholding some extraordi-
nary exertion of his courage and abilities in a
war into which he had precipitated his country,
chiefly with the design of obtaining a field where
he might display his own talents, that many
of the French nobility, who had no command
in the troops employed, accompanied him as
volunteers. This army passed the Alps in a
rigoroius season, and advanced towards Rome ,
without anly opposition from the Spaniards,
who, as they were not firong enough to adt
in different parts, had colle~ted all their forced
in one body on the frontiers of Naples, for the
defence of that kingdom.

The Pope renews hoitilities againRt Philiip.

Emboldened by the apprdach of the French,

the Pope let loose all the fury of his resentment
against Philip , which, notwithffatnding the na-
tural violence of his temper, prudential confi-
derations had hitherto obliged him to keep
under s~ome restraint. He named (Feb.l2. I557-)
commissioners , whom he empowered to pass
judgment in the fait , which the c~on fiforial
advocate had commenced against Philip. in order
to prove that . he had. forfeited the crown
of N~aples, by taking arms against the Holy
See, of which he was a vassal. He recalled
all the nuncios resident in the courts of Char-
les V. , of Philip, or of any of their allies. This

Cardinal Pole, the papal Zlegate in the court
of England, whose great merit, in havings con-
tributed so fuccefsfully to reconcile that king-
dom to the church of Rome, together with exv-
pe~tation of farther s~ervices he might perform,
was ~not: fafficient to s~creen him from thie re-
fentment which he had incurred by his zealous
endeavours to re-establish peace between the
house of Austria and France. He commended
an addition to be made to the anathemas an-
nually denounced against the enemies of the
church on Maundy-Thurfday, whereby he in-
fli~ted the cent~ure of excommun~ication -on the
authors of the late invasion of the ecclefiaffical
territories, whatever their rank or dignityl
might be; and, in cons~equence of this, the
usual prayers for the Emperor were omitted
next day in the Pope's chapel. e)

Ifjis military preparations inadequate.

But while the Pope indulged himself in those

wild and childith fatllies of rage, either he ne-
glec~ed, or found that it exceeded his power,
to take foch measures as would have rendered
his resentment really formidable, and fatal to
his enemies. For when the Dukce of Guis~e en-
t~ered Rome, where he was received with a
triumphal pomp, which would have been more

. faitable if he had been returning from having
termined the war with glory, than when he
was goings to begin it with a doubtful chance
of faccers, he found none of the preparations
for war in fach forwardness as Caraffa had pro-
rnifed, or he had expected. The papal troops
were far inferior in number to the quota flipu-
lated; no magazines fuzfficient for their fablfift-
ence were formed; nor wlas money for paying
them provided. The Venetians, agreeably to
that cautious maxim whiich the misfortunes of
their R~ate hlad first led them to adoptt and which
was now become a. fundamental principle in
their policy, declared their resolution to pre-
s~erve an exa&t neutrality, without tak~ing any
liart in the quarrels of Princes, s~o far superior-
to themnfelves in power. The other Italian states
were either openly united in league with Philip,
or secretly withed faccefs to his arms againff a
Pontif, whose inconsiderate ambition had ren-
dered Italy once more the feat of war.

Duke of Guiife's operaitions.

The duke of Guise perceived that the whole

wTeight of the war wtould devolve on him; and
becamie sensible, though too late, howr imnpro-
dent it is to relyv, in the execution of great en-
terprizes , on the aid of feeble allies. Pushed
nn, howrever, by the Pope's impatience for ac.-
tion, as wTell as by hlis own desire of performing;
fTomething of what he had so confidentivr under-

taken, he marched towards Naples, and began
(April x3. x557.) his operaLtions. But the sac-
cess of there fell far ithort of his former reputa-
tion , of what the world expedted , and of
w-hat he himself had promired. He opened the
campaign with the siege of Civitella , a town
of some importance on the Neapolitan frontier.
But the obitinacy with which the Spanish go-
vernor defended it , baffled all the impetuous
efforts of the French valour, and obliged Guise,
after a siege of three weeks, to retire from the
town with disgrace. He endeavoure~d to wipe
off that Rtain, by advancing boldly towards the
duke of Alva's camp, and offering him battle.
But that-prudent commander, sensible of all the:
advantages of itanding on the defensive befo~re
an invading enemy , declined an engagement,
and kept within his intrenchmen~ts; and adher-
i::g to his plan with the fleadinefs of a Cafti-
lian, eluded, with great address, all Gu~ife's
firatagems to draw him into a~tion. f) By this
time sickness began to waste the French army;
violent diffentions had arisen betwyeen Guise and
the commander of the Pope's forces; the Spa-
niards renew~3ed their incurflons into the eccle-
fiaftical slate; the Pope, when he found, in-
stead of the conquests and triumphs which he
had fondly expeaed, that he could pot s~ecure
hi~s own territories from depredation, murmur-

app. 3I~. but urged Paul to fulfil

pable of government, that he had given up the
reins into his hands. As he knew that Henry
'had been at great expence in fitting out the
arthsy under the duke of Guise, and that his
treafiury was hardly able to answer the exor-
bita~nt and endless demand of a. difiant war, he
foresa~w that all his operations in the Low Coun-
tries muff, of consequence, prove feeble, and
be considered only a~s secondary to thos~e in
Italy. For that reason, he prudently res~olved
to make his principal effort in that place where
he expe~ted the French to be weakest, and. to
bend: his chief force against that quarter where
they would feel a blow most sensibly. W~ith
this view, he affemnbled in the ]Low Countries
an army of about fifty thousand men, the Fle-
mings se~rving him on this occasion with that
a6'tive zeal which fuzbje~ts ·are wont to exert in
obeying the commands of a new sovereign. But
Philip , cautious and provident, even at this
early period of life, did not reft all his hopes
of s~ucces~s on that formidable force alone.

Philip endeavours to engage England in the war.

He had been labouring -for some time to

engage the EnglifCh to ef~podre his quarrel; and
though it was manifestly the interest of that
kingdom to maintain· a ftriat neutrality, and the
people themrelves' were sensible of the advan-
tug es which they derived from it; though he
knew how odious his name was to the Englith,

and how averse they would be to co-operate
with him in any measure , he nevertheless did
not despair of accomplithing his point. He re.
lied on the affe~ion wherewith the Queen
doated on him, which was t~o violent, that
even his coldness and negled had not extin-
guifhed it; he knew her -implicit reverence for
his opinion , and her fond desire of gratifying
him in every particular. That he might work
on there with greater facility, and more certain
faccefs , he set out for England. The Q~ueeBS
who, during her hufband's absence , had lan-
guithed in perpetual deje~tion, refumned fr~esh
spirits on his arrival; and, without paying the
least attention either to the intereA8 or to the
inclinations of her people, entered warmly
into all his fehemes. In vain did her privy-
council remonfirate against the imprudence as
well as danger of involving the nation in an
unnecessary war; in vain did they put her in
mind of the solemn treaties of peace faubfifting
between England and France, which the con-
dua2 of that nation had afforded her no pretext
to violate. Mary, soothed by Philip's carefl'es,
or intimidated by the threats which his afcen-
dant over her emboldened him at some times to
throw out, was deaf to every thing that: could
be urged in opposition to his f'entiments , and
insisted with the greatest vehemence on an in-·
mediate declaration of war against France. The

Operations of Philip's army in the Low Countries.

Phi'lip , who was not ambitious of military

glory, gave the command of his army to Ema-
nuel Philibert, duke of Savoy, and fixed his
own residence at Cambray, that he might be at

intelligence of his

hand to receive the earliest
motions, and to aid him with his counsels.
The duke opened the campaign with a masterly
firoke of addrer~s, which justified Philip's choice,
and discovered such a superiority of genius over
the French g~enerals, as almofte ensured fuxccels
in his s~ubs~equent operations. He appointed the

b) Carte, iii. 337. to gain or overawe

general rendez-vous of his troops at a place con-
fiderably difiant from the country which he def-
tined to be the feene of aRion; and having
hept the enemy in fufpence for a good time
with regard to his intentions, he at: last de.
ceived them so effeatually by the variety of his
marches and countermarches , as led them to
conclude that he meant to bend all. his force
against the province of Champagne , and would
attempt to penetrate into the kingdom on that
fide. In consequence of this opinon, they drew
all their firength towards that quarter, and
reinforci~ng the garris~ons there, left the towns
on other parts of the frlontier destitute oftroops
]fufficient to defend them.

Invents st. Quintin.

Emanuel, as soon as he perceived that this

feint had its full effe&t, turned fuxddenly to the
right; advanced by rapid marches into Picardy,
and sending his cavalry, in which he was ex-
tremely firong, before him, invefied St. Quintin.
This was a town deemed in that age of con-
fiderable firength, and of great importance, as
there were few fortified cities between it and
Paris. The fortifications , how~ever, had been
much negle~ted; the garrison, weakened by
draughts sent towards Champagne, did not;
amount: to a fifth part of the number requisite for
its defence; and the governor, though a brave

officer, was neither of rankr, nor authority,
equal to the 60ommand in ,a place of so much
consequence, besieged by fach a formidable army.
A few days must have put the Duke of Savoy
in p)ofeil~on of the town, if the Admiral de Co-
ligny, biho thought it concerned his honour to
attempt fazving· a place of fach importance to his
country, and which lay within his, jurifdic~ion
as governor of Picardy, had not taken the gral-
lant resolution of throwing himself into it, with
s~uch a body of men as he could coll~e~t of a
s~udden. This resolution he executed with great
intrepidity, and, if the nature of the enterpr~ize
be considered, with no contemptible success; for
though one half of his fmnall body of troops was
cut off, he, with the other, broke through
the enemy, and entered the town. The un-
expeded arrival of an officer of such high rank
and reputation, and who had· exposed himself
to f~uchi danger in order to join .them, inspired
the defponding garrison with courage. Every
thing that the admiral's great skill and expe-
rience in the art of war could suggest , for
annoying the enemy, or defending the town,
was attempted; and the citizens, as well as
the garrison, seconding his zeal with equal. ar-
dour, seemed to be determined that they would
hold out to the last , and fCacrifice themfelveis in
order to save their country~i)

The French endeavour to relieve the town.

The Duke of Savoy , whom the Englil'b,

·under the Earl of Pembroke, joined about this
time, pushed on the siege with the greatest
vigour. An army f'o numerous~, and to well
Supplied with every thing r-equisite, carried on
its approaches with great advantage against: a
garrison which was fuill so feeble that it: durfk
seldom venture to diffurb or retard the enemy's
operations by sallies. The admiral, sensible of the
approaching danger, and unable to avtert it, ac-
quainted his uncle the constable IMontmorency,
who had the command of the French army, with
his situation, and pointed out to him a method by
which he might throw relief into the town. The
conflable, solicitous to save a town, the los~s of
which would open a passage for the enemyr into
the heart of France; and eager to extricate his
nephew out of that perilous situation, in wihich
zeal for the publick had engaged him; resolved,
though aware of the danger , to attempt what
he desired, Writh this view, he marched from
La Fere towards St. Quintin at the head of his
army, which wvas not by one half so numerous
as that of the enemy, and having given the
command of a body· of chosen men to Coligny's
brother Dandelot, who was colonel general of
the French infantry, he ordered him to force
his way into the town by that avenue which
the admiral had represented as rnoft prafticable,
while he himself , with the main army ,would

give the alarm to the enemy's camp on the
opposite fide, and endeavour to draw all their
attention towards that quarter. Dandelot exe-
cuted his orders with greater intrepidity than
condu~t. His ioldiers rufbed on ( August ro.
r557.) with fach headlong impetuosity, that,
though it broke the first body of the enemy
which flood in their way; it threw themselves
into the utmost confullian; and being attacked
by fresh troopsi which clos~ed in upon them on
every fide , the greater part of them were
cut in pieces, Dandelot, with about five hun-
dred of the most adventrous, and most fortunate,
makring g~ood his entrance into the town.

The battle of St. Quintin.

Meanwhile the Constable , in ex ecuting

his part of the plan, advanced so near the camp
ofthe besiegers, as rendered it impollible to re-
treat with safety in the face of an enemy so
much superio-r in number. The Duke of Savoy
instantly perceived IV~ontmorency's error, and
.prepared, w~itch~ the pres~ence of mind and abili-
ties of a great ge~neral, to avail himself of it.
He drew up his army in order of battle, with
the greatest e-x~p~edition, and watching the mo-
melnt when the French began to file pff towards
La Fere, he detached all his caval'ry*, under
th~e comtmand of the count of ~gmont, to fall
on their rear., whYile he himse-lf, at the head of
his infantry , advanced to s~upport him. The

now perceived, struck them with general con-
fiernation. They began insensibly to quicken
their pace, and thof'e in the rear preifed to vio-
lently on such as were before them, that in a

that a retreat.

Total defeat of the French.

Egmont , observing their confulion, charga-

and authority, kept to their colours, still con-

irretrievable , rulhed into the thickest of the
enemy , with a resolution not to survive the
calamity which his ill-condu&t had brought upon
his country; but having received a dangerous
wound , and being: wasted with the loss of
blood, he was surrounded by rome Flemith of-
ficers, to whom he was known, who proteated
him from the violence of the soldiers, and ob-
liged him to surrender. Besides the Constable ,

Philip repairs to his army-.

Philip, immediately after the battle, visit-

ed the camp at St. Quintin, where he was re-
ceived with all the exultation of military tri-
umph; and falch were his transports of joy, on
account of an event which threw fCo much luffre
on the beginning of his reign , that they
softened his severe and hiaughty temper into an
unusu~al flow of courtesy. W7hen the Duke of

his hands, he caught him in his arms, and em-
bracing him with warmth: ,, It becomes me,
says he, rather to kif's your hands, which have
gained me farch a glorious and almost bloodless
viatory. 'C

His deliberations concerning the profCecution' of the livar.

As soon as the rejoicings and co~ngratula-·

tions on Philip's arrival were over, a council
of war was held, in order to determine how
they might improve their viatory to the best
advantage. The Duke of Savoy, s~econded by
fTeveral of the ablest o~ffcers formed under Char-
les V. insisted that they t~hould immediately re-
linquifh the siege of St. Qluintin, the redu~ion
of which was now an objeat below their atten-
tion, and advance direAly towards Paris; that
as there were neither troops to oppose, nor
any town of firength to retard their march,
they might reach that capital while under the
full impre~ffon of the affonif~hment and terror
occasioned by the rout of the army, and take
pofireffon of it without resistance. But Philip,
les~s adv~entrous or more pruxdent than his gene-
rals, preferred a moderate but certain advan-
tage, to an enterprize of greater splendour, but
of more doubtful fuccers. He repres~ented to
the council the infinite res~ources of a kingdom
so powerful as France; the great number as well
as martial f'pirit of its nobles; their attachment;

lent of governing the minds of men, together
with a capacity of maintaining his afcendaunt
over them even under circumffances the moit
adverse and diikrefsful, were qualities which
Coligny poielbffd in a degree superior to any
general of that age. Ther~e qualities were pec
culiarly adapted to the Rtation in which he was
now placed; and as he knew the infinite im-
portance to his country of every hour which he
could gain at this jundture, he exerted hitnfelf
to the utmost in contriving how to protraRl the
diage, and to detain the enemy from attempting
any enterprize more dang~erous to France,

Which is tekeni by assault.

Such were the pers~everance and Skrill with

which he condu~ed the defence; and such the
fortitude as well as patience with which he
animated the garriifon, that though the Spa-
niards, the Flemings, and the Englis~h, carried
on the attack with all the ardour which natio-
aal emulation inspires, he held out the town
seventeen days. He was taken prisoner, at
last, (Auguit. sy. 2557.) on the breach overpow-
ered by the superior number of the enemy.

Benry's meafnres for the defence of his kingdom.

Henry availed himself , with the utmost

a~tivity, of the interval which the Admiral's
well-timed obilinacy Jland afforded him. He ap-
pointed officers to colleat the scattered remaina

Jevying soldiers in every part of the kingdom;
he commanded the ban and: arriere ban of the
frontier provinces instantly to take the field ,
and to join the Duke of Nevers at Laon in Pi-
cardy; he recalled the greater part of the ve-
teran troops which served under the IVarechal
Brifface in Piedmont; he sent courier after cou-
rier to the Duke of Guite, requiring him, to-
gether with all his army, to return instantly
for the defence of their country ;r he dispatched
one envoy to the Grand Signior , to solicit the
affillance of his fleet, and the loan of a f~um of
money; he sent another into Scotland, to in-
cite the Scots to invade the north of England,
that, by drawing Mary's attention to that quar-
ter, he might prevent her from reinforcing her
troops which frerved under Philip. These efforts
of the King were warmly foconded by the zeal
of his fubjeats, The city of Paris granted him
a free gift of three hundred thoufarnd livres.
The other great towns imitated the liberality
of the capital, and contributed in proportion.
Several noblemen of diftin~tion engaged, at
their own experice, to garrison and defend the
towns which lay most exposed to the enemy.
Nor· was the general concern for the publick
confined to communities alone, or to thof'e in
the higher sphere of life, but diffufing itself
among persons of every rank, each individual
seemed disposed to a~t with as much vigour as

if the honour olf the K~ing, and th-e safety of
the state, had depended foolely on his personal

The viaory of St. Quintini prodluhive of few beneficial

confeqlue nces.

Philip, who was no fkranger either to the

-pr-udent meafuires taken by the French· monarch
for the s~ecurity of his dominions, or to the fpi-
rit with which his fuubje~ts prepared to defend
themselves, perceived, when it was too late,
that he had loft an opportunity wvhich could ne-
ver be recalled, and that it was now vain to
-think~7 f penetrating into the heart of France. He
.abandone~d, therefore, without much relu~tance,
a sc~heme which was too bold and- hazardous to
be perfEe~tly agreeable to his cautious temper ,
and employed his army , during the remainder
of the campaign, in the sieges of Ham and Ca-
te~let. Of ther~e, he soon becamee matter; and
the redaftion of two fach petty towns, thoge-
ther with the acquisition of St. Quintin, were
all the advantages which he derived from one
of the most decisive vi~tories gained in that cen-
tu~ry. Philip hims~elf, however, continued in
hig-h exultation on account of his fauccefs; and
as all1 his paflions were tinged with s~upers~tition
he, in memory of the battle of St. Quintin,
which had been fought on the day consecrated

tale, had

been the in Churent of St. Laurence's martyr-
dorn7. Notwithilanding the vast and expensive
Echemes in wThich his reftle fs ambition involved
him , Philip continued the building with s~uch
perseverance for twenty-two years, and referv-
ed f'uchl vast sums for this monument of his
devotion and vanity, that the monarchs of Spain
are indebted to him for a royal residence,
w7hich , though not the most elegant, is cer tain-
ly the most sumptuous and magnificent of any
in Europe. n)

The French army recalled out of Italy.

The first account of that fatal blow~ which

the French had received at St. Quintin was car-
ried to Rome by the courier whom Henry had
sCent to recal the Duke of Guise. As Paul, even
Iwith the affifiance of his French auxiliaries,
had hardly been able to check the progre~s of

the Spanifhi arms, he foresaw that, as soon as
he was depriv~ed of their prote~tion , his terri-
tories must be over-run in a moment. He re-
monfirated therefore with the greatest violence
againit the departure of the French army, re-
proaching the Duke of'Guife for his ill-condua,
which had brought him into such an unhappy
situation; and· complaining of the , King for de-
serting him so ungenerously under fach eircum-e
f~a-nces. Guife's ordres, however, were per-
emptory. Paul, inflexible as he was, found
it necessary to accommodate his conduat to the
extigency of his af~fairs, and to employ the me-
dlation of the ~Venetians , and of Cosmo, di Mle-
dici, in order to obtain peace. Philip, who
had been forced unwillingly to a rupture with
the Pope, and wvho, even while fauccef~s crown-
ed his arms, doubted to much the juffice of
his own cause, that he had made frequent over-
tures of paci~fication, liktened eagerly to the
first proposals of this nature from Paul, and dif7-
covered fach moderation in his demands, as
could hardly have been expeated from a Prince
elated with vi~ory,

A treaty of peace between the Pope and Philip.

The Duk~e of Alva on the part of Philip,

and the Cardinal Caraffa in the name of his
uncle, met at Cavi, and both being equally
disposed to peace, they, after a short confer-
ence, terminated the wa~r by a treaty, on ther

following terms: That Paul thould renounce
his league with Fran'e, and inaintain for the
future foch a neutrality as became the common
father of Chriffendom; that Philip thould in-
fkantly reffore all the towns of the ecclesiastical
territory of which he had taken poffeilion; that
the claims of the Caraffas to the dutchy of Pa-
liano, and other demefues of the Colonnasi
tChould be referred to the deciilon of the repu-
blic of Venice; that the Duke of Alva thould
repair in person to Rome, and after asking par-
don of Paul in his own name, and in that of
his master, for having invaded the patrimony
of the church, fbould receive the Pope's abfo~
lution from that crime. Thus Paul, through
Philip's ferupulous timidity, finis~hed an unpro-i
f~perous war without any detrimeilt to the Pa-
pal See. The conqueror appeared humble,
and acknowledged his error; while he who
had been vanquis~hed retained his usual hangrhti-
ners, and was treated with every mark of
s~uperiority. o) The Duke ofAlva, in terms of
the treaty, repaired to Rome, and, in the
poffure of a supplicant, kiffred the feet, and
implored the forgiveners of that very person
whom his arms had reduced to the last extre-
mity. Such was the superstitious veneration
of the Spaniards for the papal chara~ter, thait
Alva, thoug~h perhaps the proudest man of the

that when he approached the Pope, he was
to much overawed, that his voice failed, and
his pres~ence of mind forsook him. p)

Philip reffores Placentia to O~avio FarneTe.

But though this war, which at its com-

Inencement: threatened mig~hty revolutions, was
brought to an end without occaiioning any al-
terationl in thos~e States which were its immedi-
ate obje~t, it produced effe~ts of considerable
consequence in other parts of Italy. As Philip
was extremely· solicitous to terminate his quar-
rel with Paul as s~peedily as pollble, he was
wuiilling to make any fagcrifice in order to gain
those Princes, who, by joining their troops to
the Papal and French army, might have prolong-
ed the war. 'With this view,~v he entered into
a negociation with O~tavio Farnese, Duke of
Parma, and , in order to seduce him from his
alliance with France, he reffore~d to him the
city of Placentia, with the territory depending
on it, which Charle-s V. had seized in the year
one thousand five hundred and forty-feven, had
kept from that time in his poffeiron, and had
transmitted, together with his other dominions,
to Philip.

Cofmno di Medici's meahrues for obtaining Siena.

This Prep made fach a dis~covery of Philip's

charadfer and views to Cosmo di Mledici, the
most sag~acious as well as provident of all the
Italian Princes, that he conceived hopes of ac-
complifhing his favourite scheme of adding Siena
and its territories to his dominions in Tuf~canyi
As his fauccefs in this attempt depended enti-
rely on the delicacy of address with which it
thould be conduaed, he employed all the refi-
nemenits of policy in the negociation which he
set on foot for this purpos~e. He began with
soliciting Philip, whose treasury he knew to
be entirely drained by the expence of the war,
to repay the great faums which he had advanced
to the Emperor during the siege of Siena.
When Philip endeavoured to elude a demand
which he was unable to s~atisfy , Co'fmo affe~ted
to be extreinely dif~quieted , and making no secret
of his difguff , infirudted his amnbaffador at Rome
to open a negociation with the Pope, which seem.
ed to be the effedt of it. The ambafaidor exe-
cuted his com million which such d exterity, that
Paul, imagining Cosmo to be entirely alienated
from the Spanis~h interest , proposed to him an
alliance with France, which thould be cement-
ed by the marriage of his eldest s~on to one of
Henry's daughters. Cosmo received the over-
ture with such apparent fatisfa~tion , and with
so many profeilions of gratitude for the high

honone of which he had the profpe~t, that not
only the Pope's miniffers , ·but the French en-
loy· at Bom~e, talked confidenltyS, an~d with
little refervie, of the accei'on of that important
ally, as a matter' certain sad decided. The
account of this was quickly carried to Philip;
and Cofnto, who foirefagw how mluch it would
alarm him, bad dif~pathed his nephew Ludo-
vico de Toledo into the Netherlands, that he
mnight be at hand to observe and take adviantage
of his consternation, before the first impreilion
which it made thould in any degree abatei
Cofino was extremely fortunaite in the choice
of the infir~ument wihom he employed. Toledo
waited , with patience , until hie discovered
wKith certainty , that Philip had received f~uchi
intelligence of his uticle's negociations at Rome~,
as musk haive filled his fCurpicious milld with
fear and jealoofyr; and then craving an audience,
he requirced payment of the money which had
been borrowed by the Emperor, in the inofLt
earnest and peremptory terms. In urg~ing that
point, he ~artfully threw out se~veral dar'k hints
and ambiguous declarations , concerning the
extremnities to which Cofino might be driven by
a refusal of this just demand, as well as by
other grievances of which he had good reason
to complain,

Their facef~s.

Phlilip, allonilhed at an address in f'uch a

Arain, from a Prince to far his inferior as the
Duke of Tuscany, and comparing wrhat he now
heard with the information which he had re-
ceived from Italy , immediately concluded that
Cos~mo had ventured to affutte this bold and u~nu-
fual tone on the profpeat of his union with
France. In order to prevent the Pope and
Henry from acquiring an ally, who, by his
abilities, as well as the situation of his domi.
nions, would have added both reputation and
firength to their confederacy , he offered to
grant Cosmo the investiture of Siena , if he would
codient to accept of it as an equivalent for the
sams due to him, and engage to furnish a body
of troops towards the defence of Philip's terri-
tories in Italy, against any power who thould
attack them. As soon as Cofmno had brought
Philip to make this concefflon, which was the
obje&t of all his artifices and intrigues , he did
not protra&t the negociation by any unnecessary
delay, or any excef's of refinement, but closed
eagerly with the propos~al, and Philip, in spite
of the remofiiirances of his ablest counsellors,
signed a treaty with him to that effeA. q)

lity, and render~ed less4 valuable than it had
been since it received the first violent t~hockr from

The Duke of Gulfe's reception in F~rance.

Th e D uke of Gruife left Romne on th e f'ame day

(Sept. 29. 1557.) that his adversary the Duke of
Alva made his humiliating f~ubmifiron to the Pope.
He was received in France as the guardian angel
of the k~ingdom. His late ill s~uccess in Italy
fecemed to, be forg~otten, w~hile his former s~er-

vices, particularly his defence of IMetz, were
recounted with exaggerated praise; and be was
welcomed in every city through which he paired,
as -the refforer of publick security, who , after
having set bounds by his con~du&t and valour to
the viatorious arms of Charles V. returned now,
at the call of his countryr, to c~heck the formi.
dable progres~s of Philip's power. The recep-
tion which he met with froat Henry . was no
less cordial and honourable. New titles were
invented, and new dignities created, in order
to distinguish him. He was appointed lieute-
nant-general in chief both within and without
the kingdom, with a jurifdiaion almost unlimnit-
ed , and hardly inferior to that which was
poffeffed~ by the King himself. Thus , through
the singular felicity which attended the Princes
of Lorrain, the miircarriage of their owcn fche-
mes contributed to aggrandize them. The ca-
lamities of his country, and the ill conduat of
his rival the Conflable, exalted the Duke of
Guise to a height of dignity and power, which
he could not have expyecced to attain by the
most fortunate and most complete fauccef~s of
his own ambitious projeats.

Takes the command of the army.

The D~uke of GuiTe, eager to perform some-

thin g faitable to the high expedtations of
his countrymen, and that he might juffify the

rep~osed- in him , ordered all the troops, which
cotild be got together , to assemble at Com-
piegne. Though the winter· was well advanced,
and had set in with exutreme rigour, he placed
himself at their head, and took the field. By
Henry's a~tivity anld the zeal of his fixbjets,
to many fColdiers - ad been ralifed in the king-
dom, and fuchn consider~able reinforcemnents had
been drawn fromn Germany and Swifferland, as
for~med an army refpeefable even in the eyes of
a viAorious enemy. Philip, alarmed at feeing
it put in motion at s~uch an un~common season,
began to tremble for his new conqueits, parti-
cularly Sti ;Quintin, the fortifications of which
were hitherto but imperfe~tly repaired.

He invests Calaisl

But: the D~uke of Gnife meditated a more;

.important enterprize; and after amusing the
enemy with threatening fliccefirvely d~ifferent:
towusns on the fr~oiitiers of Slanders, he turned
fad8denly to the left, and invefied Calais (Jan~. r.
1t558.) with his wvhole army. Calais had been ta-
ken by the English under Edward III. and was the
fruit of that monarch's glorious vi~tory at Crecy.
Being the only place that they retained of their
ancient and extensive territories in France, and
which opened to them, at all times, an easy
and secure pas sage into the heart of that kingdom,
their keeping poffefflon of it soothed the pride

of the one nation as much as it mortified the
vanity of~ the other. Its fituatioqn wa~s natu-
rally to fi~rong;, and its fortifications deemed lo,
impregnable,~ that no monarch of France, how
adventurous foaever, had been bold enougrh to
attack it. Even when the domreftick strength
of England was broken and exhausted by the
bloody wars between the houses of York and
Lancaster, and its attention entirely diverted
from foreign Bbjeats, Calais had remained un-
disturbed and unthreatened. Mary and her
council, composed chiefly of ecclefiaftickrs,
unacquainted with military affairs, and whole
whole attention wa~s turned towards extirpating
herefyr 4ut of the kingdom, had not only ne-
gle~ted to take any precautions for the safety
of this fmportant place, but seemed to think
that the rep~utation of its firength alone was
.fuffiicient for its sec~urity. Full of this opinion,
they ventured, even after the declaration of
war, to continue a praftice which the low slate
of the Queen's finances had introduced in times
of peace. As thle country adjacent to Csalis
was overfloweyd during the winter , and th~e
marshes around it became impaffahle, except
by one avenue, which the forts of St. Agatha
and Newnham-bridge commanded, it had been
the cugom of the English to difmifis the greater
part of the garrison towards the end of autumq,
and to replace it in the spring.

lIx vain did ]Lord Wentworth, ~the governor

o~f Calais, remonstrate againit this ill-timed par-
fxmony , and reprefeat the po4ribility of his
being attacked suddenly , while he had not troops
fufficient to man the works. The: privy-council
treated ·there~ remonfirances with s~corn, as if
they had, flowed fromn the timidity or the ria-
pa~cioufnef~s of the governor; and some of them,
wi'th that cor fxdence which is the companioix
of ignorance, boaited that they would defend
Cala~is with their white rods againift any enemy
who thould approach it during wintert. r) In
tirain did Philip, who had paffekd through Calais
as he returned from England to the Nether-
landis, warn the Queen of the danger to which
It wa~s exposed; and acquainting her with what
was necessary for its securit~y, in vain did he
offer to reinfor'ce the garrison during winter
with a detachment of his ownl troops. . Mary's
count~ellors, though obfequiours ,to her in all.

The splendour and effe&t of thele conqueas.

Thus, in a few days, during the depth of

wiinter, and at a time when the faLtal battle of
St. Quintin had to .depress~ed the sanguine spirit
of the French, that their utmost aim was to
protedt their own country, without dreaming
of making conqueits on the enemy, the enter-
.prizing valour of one man drove the English
out of Calais, after they had held it two hun-
dred and ten years, and deprived them of every
foot of land in a kingdom, where their domi-
nions had been once to extenfirve. This ex-
ploit, at the fame time that it gave an high
idea of the power and resources of France to
all Europe, set the Duke of Guise, in the opi-
nion of his .countrymen, far above all the ge-
nerals of the age. They celebrated his con-
quests with immoderate transports of joy; while
the Engiifh gave vent to all the pafflons
which animate a high spirited people, when any
great national calamity is rnanifeftly owi'ng to
the ill conduat of their rulers. 1V~ary and her
miniffers, formerly odious, were now contempt-
ible in their eyes. All the terrors of her fe-
vere and arbitrary adminiffration could not re--

itrain them from uttering execrations and t~hreats
against those, who having wantonly involved
the nation in a quarrel wherein it was nowise
interested, had by their negligence or incapacity,
brought irreparable disgrace on their country,
and 10ft the most valuable poffefion belonging
to the English crown.

The French King imitated the condi~t of

its former conqueror , Edward III. with regard
to Calais. He commanded all the English in-
habitants to quit the town, and giving their
houses to his own f~ubjefts, whom he allured
to fettle there by granting them various irmma-
nities, he left a numerous garrison, under an
experienced governor, for their defence. After
this , his viftorious ar-my went into quarters of

Charles's resignation of the Imperial crown.

During ther~e various operations, Ferdinand

assembled the college of Ele(Ftors at Frankfort,
in order to lay before thean the deed whereby
Charles V. had resigned the Imperial crown,
and transfer~red it to him. This he had hitherto
delayed on account of some difficulties which
had occurred concerning the formalities ·requisite
in iApplying a vacancy occasioned by an event,
to which there was no' parallel in the annals
of the Empire. There being at length adjuffed,
the Prince of Orange executed (Febr. 24. T558-)

the comnmiion with whrich he had beent entraft-~
ed by Charles; thle Ele~ors accepted of his
r~esignation; declare~d Ferdinand his lawful sac-
ceffor; and put: him in poff'etion ;of all the en-
,signs of the Im~perial dignity.

the Scots the imprudence of involving their
c~ountry- in every quarrel between France and
England, neither the folicitations of his amL
baf'ador, nor the addres~s and authority of the
Queen-regent, could prevail on them to take
arms againit a kingdom with which they were
at peace. On this occasion the ardour of a1
martial nobility and of a turbulent people was
restrained by regard for the publick interest and
tranquillity, which, in former deliberations of
this kind had been seldom attended to by a
nation always prone to rush into every nhew
war. But though the Scots adhered with fica4
dinefs to their pacifick fyfitem, they, wiere exr-
tremely ready to gratify the Fren~chi King in

Marriage: of the Diiuphin wikith the Queen of Scots.

The young Queen of Scots had been a~ianc-

ed to the Dauphin in the year one thousa8nd
five hundred and forty-eight, and having been
educated since that tialk~ in the court of France,
the had grown up to be the most amiable, and
one of the most accomplished Princeff'es of that
age.- Henry demanded the confeat of her sub-
je £ks to the celebration of the marriage, and
a parliament which was held for that purpore,
appointed eight commi~fioners to reprefeat the
w·hole body of the nation at that solemnity,
w~ith power to sign sUch deeds as might be re-

qulfite before it was concluded. In fettling
tthe articles of the marriage, the Scots took
ever~y precaution that prudence could didate,
in order to preserve the Itberty and independ-
etice of their country; while the French afed
every art to s~ecure to the Dauphin the conduff
of affairs during the! Queen's life, and the sac-
cedion of the crown on the event of her demile.
The marriage was celebrated with pomp fauit-

vanced towards Nieuport, which mult have soon
fallen into his hands, if the approach of the
Count of Egmont with a superior army had not
made it prudeist to retreat. The French troops
were to much en'cumbered with the booty which
they had got at D~unkirk, or by ravaging the
open country,- -that they moved slowly ; and
Egmont, who had left his heavy baggstge and
artillery· behind him, marched with fach rapi-
dity, that he came up with them near Gravei
lines , and attacked them with the utmost im-
petuofity. De Termes, who had the choice of
the ground , having posted his troops to advan,
tage in the angle formed biy the mouth of the
river Aa and the s~ea, received him with great
firmners.' Vidtory remained for some time in
Afpenfe, the desperate valour of the French ,
who forefawu the unavoidable deftrudtion that
must follow upon a rout in an enemy's country,
counterbalancing the s~uperior numnber of the
Flemingso, when one of those accidents to which
human prudence, does not extend, decided the
conteRt in favour of the latter. A squadron of
English thips of war, which was cruizing on
the coast, being drawn by the noise of the firing
towards the place of the engagement, entered
the river Aa, and turned its great guns against
the right wing of the French, with such effedt,
as immediately broke that body , and spread
terror and confusion through thez whole army.
The Eleminjgs, to whom alif~tance, s~o unex-

peRt-

pe~ted and t~o seasonable, gave frefb spirit, re-
doubled their efforts, that they: might not lose
the advantage which fortune had prefeated
them, or give the enemy time to recover from
their consternation, and the rout of the French
soon became universal. Near two thousand were
krilled' on the spot; a greater numober fell by the
hands of the peasants, who, in revenge for
the cruelty~ with which their country had been
plundered, pursued the fugitives and malTacred
them without mercy; the reft were takren pria
foners, together with De Termes their general,
and many officers of diftindtion. x)

The Duke of Guise opposed to the viatorious army.

This sig-nal vi~tory, for which -the Comat

of Egmont was afterwards to ill requited by
Philip, obliged the D~uke of Guis~e to relinquish
all other frchemnes, and to hasten towards~ th~e
frontier of Picardy, that he might oppose the
progress of the enemy in that province. This
ditafter· refle~ted new luffre on his reputation,
and once more turned the eyes of his coun-
trymen towards him, as the only general on
w~hose arms viatory always attended, and in
whose condued, as well as good fortune, the~y
could confide in every: danger. Henry rein-
forced Guire's army with so many troops drawn
from the adjacent garrisons , that it s~oon

]Dake of Sav'oy, was not inferior in number.
Th'ey encampeid at the difiance of a few leagues
from one another; and each mbnari~h having
5olned his refpetive armyI, it was expeaed >
-after the vicifirtudes of good and bad` fucceft
ddring this and the former campaign , that a
di~ecifive battle wvould at last dretermine, which
b;s the rival· th~ould take the as~cendent for the
future, ·and~ give law' to Europe. B~ut though
-both -had it in their power a neiher of th~etr
d~ifbovered ariy inclination to bring the determiL
nation of such an important point to depend
upon t'hi ujncertain and fortuitous issue of a
-ingle battle. The fatal engigembnts at St.
-Quintin and .Gravelines were too recent to be
·fo:f~oon- forgotten, and the prlofpedt of encoun-
·tering the fame troops, commanded by the fitn~e
-enerals who, had twice triumphed over his
arms, inspired Henry with a degree of caution
which was not common to him~. Philip, of a
·genius avers~e to bold operations in war, natu-
rally leaned to cautious meafutes, and would
hazard nothing against a. general t~o fortunate
·anl facef~sfulrl .as the Duke of Guifel- Both mo-
-narchs, as if by agreement, flood on th~e deL
Afnfive, and fortifying their camps carefully ,
avoided every fkrirmith or rencounter that might
bring on a general engagement,

Both mona2rchs begin to desire peace.

While the armies continued in this inalfion ,

_peace began to be mentioned in each camp~, and
both Henry and Philip diicovered an inclination
to liffen to any overture that tended to re-efta-
Alifh it. The kingdoms of France and Spain
had been engaged during half a centuriy in al-
most continual wars, carried on at grteat ex-
pence, and produaive of' no, considerable advan-
tage to dither. Exhausted by extraordinary and
uncealing efforts, which far exceeded those to
which the nations of Europe had been accustomed
before the rivalthip between Charles V. and Fran-
cis I. ,both nations longed to much for an inter-
val of repole, in order to recruit their fitength,
that their sovereigns drew from them with dif-
ficulty the Cupplies necefibary for carrying on
holtilities. The private inclinations of both the
King5s concurred with thof'e of their preople.-
Philip was pronipted to wif'h for peace by his
fond desire of returning to Spain. Accustomed
from his infancy to the climate and manners of
that country , he was attached to it with~ fach
extreme prediletion , that he was unhalily in
any other part of his Dominions. But as he
could not quit the Low Countries, either with
decency or fafetyr, and venture on a voyage to
Spain during the continuance of war, the pro-
[pedt of a pacification which would put it in his
power to execute his favourite feheme, was
Pighly acceptable. Henry was no lets desirous

Sthe D~uke of inif~e: There arts, he wtas afraid,
might, by'degrees, work on the easy and due-
tile mi~nd of I-enry, s~o as to efface all remains
of his ancien~t affe~tion towards hiimfelf. But:
he could not: discover any remedy for this, un.
.less hk (vere allowed to return home, that he

mig~ht try whether by his presence he could de-
feat the artifices of his enemies , and revive
those warm and. tender sentiments whichi had
long attached Henry to him, with a confidence
to entire, as resembled rather the cordiality of
private friendship, than the cold and feldfi
;connexion between a monarch and one of his
courtiers. · While Montmorency was formning
s~chemes and withes for his return to FraLnce
with much anxiety of mind , but with little
hope of fuccers, an unexpe~ted incident pre-
pared the way for it. The Cardinal of Lorrain,
who had fbhared with his brother in the King's;
favour, and participated of the, power which
that conferred, did not bear prosperity with the
·fame difecretion as the Duke of Guise. Intoxicated
with their good fortune, he forgot how much
they had been indebted for their pres~ent elevation
to their connexions with the Dutchess of Valeni-
tinois, and vainly aferibed all to the extraordi-
nary merit of their family. This led himp not
only to negle~t his ben~efaarefs, but to thwart
her schemes, and to talk with a fa8rca~ftick li-
berty of her charader and person. That. fin-
gular woman, who, if wre may believe con-
temporary writers , retained the beauty· and
charms of youth at the age of threescore, and
on whomu it is certain that Henry still doated
with all the fo~ndnes~s of love , felt this injuryv
with sensibility, and set herself w-ith eagerner's
tp revenge it. As there was no method of

·Fuppla'nting· the P~rinces of Lorrain to effec~ually
as by a coalition of interets with the Constable,
the pr~oposed the marriage of her grand-daughter
with one of' his s~ons, as the bond of their fu-
tCure union; and 1Montmorency readily gave his
content to the match. H'aving thu's ·cemented their
alliance , the' Dutchess employed all her in-
lu~ence with the King, in order to confirm his
i~nclin~ations towards peace, and induce him to
Zake the iteps necessary for attaining it. She
insinuated that any overture of that kind would
some with great propriety from the Constable,
and if committed to the condu&t qs his prudeneq,
could hardly fail of farcepfis.

HOnry CommitS the negoclation to MOntmorency.

Henr-y long accuitomed to devolve all as-,

fairs of importance to the Constable, and need-
Ing~ only this encouragement to return to his
ancient habits, wrote to~ him immediately with
his usual famniliarityT and at~eetion, empowering
him at the fame time to tak~e the first opportu-
mity of founding Philip and his ministers with
regard to peace. M·ontmorency made his ap-
plication to Philip by the moit proper channel.
He opened himsel~f to the Duke of Savoy,
wvho , notwithstanding the height to which he
had been raised, and the military glory w~hichi
he had acquir~ed in the Spanish service, was
weary of remaining in exile, and langrulfhed
to return into hIs dqtpinions. As there was·

no profpedt of his recovering poffeilion of thent
by force of arms, he considered a difinitive
treaty of peace between France and Spain, as
the. only event by· which he could hope to ob-
tain restitution. Being no itranger to Philip's
private withes with regard to peace, he easily
prevailed on him not only to discover a difpofi-
tion on his part towards accommodation , but
-to permit M~ontmorency to return, on his parole,
to France, that he might confirm his owmn fover-
eign in his pacifick sentiments. He~nry re-
ceived the Confrable with the most flattering
marks of regard ; ablence , instead of having
abated or extinguiifhed the Mlonarch's friendship,
seemed to have given it new ardour. Mlontmo-
rency, from the moment of his appearance in
court, affa~med , if possible , a higher place
than ever in his affe.~tion, and a more perfeft
a~c~endant over his mind. The Cardinal of Lor-
rain and D~uke of G uife prudently gave way to
a tide of fav~our too strong for thlem to oppose,
and confining themselv~es to their proper
departments, permitted, without any strug~gle,
the Constable arnd D~utchess of Vralentinois t~o
dire~t publick affairs at their pl~easure. They
soon prevailed on th~e Kiing to nominate pleni-
potentriaries to treat of peace. Philip did· the
fame. The abbey of Cercamp was Ex~ed on asi
the place of congrtefs; and all military opera-
tions wer~e iammdi~atelv termi~nated by a fii~-
penflon of arm~s.

Death of Charles V.

Wrhile there preliminary fieps were taking

towar~ds a treaty which· r~eforedt tranquillity to
Europe , Charles V. -whose ambition had fa
l'ong disturbed it, ended his days in the mo,
stafery of St. Juitus. When Charles entered
this retreat, he formed s~uc~h a plan of life for
himself , as wrould have faited the condition of
a private gentleman of a moderate fortune. His
table was neat, but plain; his domefficks few;
bis interc~ouyre with them familiar; all the cum-
.berf~ome and ceremonious forms of attendance
on his person were entirely abolithed , as def-
tru~tive of that social ease and traziquillity which
he courted, in order to soothe ithe remainder
of his days. }ks the mildnef's of the climate,
together with his deliverance from the burdens
and cares of government, procured him, at -firfk,
a confiderable' remiffl~on from the acute pains
with which he had been long tormented; he
enjoyed, perhaps, more complete satisfaction
in this humble s~olitude, than all his grandeur
ha~d ever yielded him. The ambitious thoughts
and projeAs which had to long engrossed and
·difquieted him , were quite effaced from his
mind : Far from taking· any part in the political
tranlfa~tions of the Princes of Europe, he re-
fkrained his curiolity even from any enquiryr con-
cerning them; and he fieemed to view the busyS
fe~ene which he had abandoned with all the .con-
tempt and indi~fference arising from his thorough

experience of its vanity, -as well as from the
ple~asing reflexion of having dif~entangled-himf~elf
riom its cares.

His amufemnents in his retreat.

Other amufemnents, and other objeflts now

occupied him. Sometimes he cultivated the
plants in his garden with his own hands; some-
times he rode out to the neighbouring wood
on a little horse,. the only one that he kept,
attended by a single servant on foot. When his
infirmities confined him to his apartment, which
often happened, and deprived him of there more
Rative recreations, he either admitted a few
gentlemen who resided near the monastery to
~visit him, and entertained them familiarly at
his table; or he employed himself in studying
mechanical prinexples and in forming curious
works of mechanis~m, of which he had always
been remarkably fond, and to which his genius
was peculiarly turned. W~ith this view he had
engaged Tarriano, one of the most ingenious
artists of that age, to accompany him in his re-
treat. He laboured together with him in fram-
ing models of the most ofeful muachines, as well
as in making experiments with regard to their
refpeLftive powers, and it was not seldom that
the ideas of the monarch allifted or perfe~c-
ed the inventions of the artist. He relier-
ed his mind , at intervals , w-ith slighter

and more fantattick wvorks of mechanism, in
fathioning puppets, which, by the ftruaure
of internal frprin~gs, mimicked the geflures and
rt~ions of men, to the no small affonithment
of the ignorant monkrs, who h~eholding mnove-
mnents which they could not comprehend , fme-
times d~ifrafted their own fienfes, and some-
times fuzTpea~ed Charles and Tarriano of being
in coqmpa&t with Invisible powers. Hle was par-,
ticularly curious with regard to the confiru~tion
of cloks and watches; and having found, after
repeated triels, that he could not bring any:
two of, them to go exadly alike, he r~efle~ed ,
it. is said, with a mixture of s~urprise as well as
regret, on his own folly, in having bellowed
toi -much .time and labour on the more vain at-:
tempt of bringing mankind to a precise unifor-
mity of frentiment concerning the intricate and
m~ysterious 'doftrines of religion,

His more serious occupations.

But in what manner soever Charles disposed

of the reft of his time, he conibantly reserv-ed
a considerable portion ofit for· religious exer-
cife~s. He regularly attended divine service in
the chapel of the monastery , 'every morning
aixd evening;· he took great pleasure in reading
books of devation', particularly: the works of
St. Auguiline and SC. Bernard; and conversed
mu~ch with his confeffor, and the prior of the

monastery, on pious fabjeats. Thus did Char-,
ies pas~s the first year of his retreat, in a manner
not unbecoming a man perfelctly dif~engagted from
the afagirs of the prefehnt life, and itanding on
the confines of a future world, either in ifnnow
cent amuiements , which soothed· his pains ,
and relieved a mind worn out with excessive
application to bufiners; or in devout occupa,
tions, which he deemed necefrary in preparing
for another itate.

The cadels of his death.

But about fix months before hiis death , the

gout, after a longer intermiliron than ufuzal ,reT
t/arned writh a proportional increase of violence.
His th~attered constitution had not vigour enough
remainingr to withfland fach a thock. It en-
feebled his mind as much as his body , and from
this period we hardly dircern any traces of that
found and rnafculine understanding, which dif~
tingulfhed Charles among his contemporaries.
An illiberal and timid superstition depressed his
spirit. He had no relif'h for amuiements of any
krind. He endeavoured to conform , in his
manner of living, to all the rigour of monaftick
aufferity. He d'efred no other society than
that of monks, and was almost continually em-
ployed with them in chaaningg the himits of the
INliffal. As an ejipiation for his fins, he g~ave
himself the discipline in secret with sauch fevee
rity: that the wthip of cords which he employed

after his decease 'tinged with his blood. Nor
was h-e fLatisified with there a~ts of mortification,
which1, howsever sever~e, were not unexampled.
The timorolls and diffrdifuI1 solicitude which
always accompanies CTuperftition ,* ill continued
to dif~quiet' him, ·and: depreciating alli tha~t be
had done, prompted him to aim at something
extraordinary, at some new and singular aEt of
piety that would display his zeal, and merit
the favour of heaven. The a& on which he
fixed was as wild and uncommon as any that:
s~uperstition ever fu~ggefied to a weak and difor-
dered fancy. :He resolved to celebrate his own
obl~equies before his death. He ordered his tomb
to be ere~ted in, the chapel of the monastery.
His domefticks marched thither in funeral pro-
cellion, with· black tape~rs in their hands. He
himself followed in his throud. * He was laid in
his coffin, with -much folermnity. The service
for the dead was chanted , and. Charles joined
in the prayers which were offered up for the
reRt of his foul, .mingling his tears with there
which his attendants thed, as if they had been
celeb~rating a real funeral. The ceremony closed
with sprink~ling holy water on the coffin in the
usual form, and all the assistants retiring, the
doors of the chapel were that. Then Charles
rose out of the coffina, and withdrew to his
apartment, full of thos~e awful s~entiments which
fac~h a singular solemnity was calculated to in-

spire. But either the I'atiguing~ length-, of
the ceremonyi or the imptrefilionm whrich this~
image of death left· on his mnind;, affefted him
to mluch, that ne~it day he was -Leized .with - a
fever. His feeble frame could not- long relft
its violence, and he expired- on the twenaty-
firlt of Septemberi after a life of fifty-eight
y ears , fix months, and tw~enty-·five dayls. y)

£etiabling the desu-ltory and irregnlar sallies of
.Henry VIII. or Francis Izhad the appearance of
a caoniftent system s in which all the parts were
arranged, the efeas were foreseen, and the
arsccidents were provtided for. His promptitude
in execution was no less re~markable than his
patience in deliberatrion. He consulted with
phlegm, but he aded w~ith vig~our ; and did
not· discover greater fagacitty in his choice of
the measures which it was proper to pursue,
than fertility of genius in finding out the means
for reodering his ·pearfiit: of ·themn fucefsful.
Tihough he had natulrally to little of the martial
turn; that, during the most ardent and bustling
period of lifei he remained in the cabinet in-
aZ~ive, yet when he chofre at length to appear
ati the head of his armies,. his mind was to
forme~d for vigorous exertions in every direc-·

tion, that he acquired fatch kgnow~ledge in the
art of war, and such ~talehbts for command, as
rendered him equal in reputation and fatccefs
to the most able generals of the age. But Char-
les poffeffed, in the melt eminent degree, -the
science which is of greateAt importance to a
monarch, that of knowing men, and of adapt-
ing their talents to the varivvv~~~~~vvvvv~~~~ous departments
which he alloted to them. From the death of
Chievres to the end of his reibi, he employed
no generall in the field, no miniffer in the cabis
net, no ambassador to a foreign court, no go-
vernor of a provinc~e, whos~e abilities were ina.
dequate to the trust which he repos~ed in them.
Trhough -deffitute of that bewitching affability
of manners, which gained Francis the hearts
of all who approached his person, he was no
firanger to the virtues which secure fidelity- and
attachment. He placed unbounded confidence
in his generals; he rewarded their services with
munificence; he neither envied their fame , nor
discover~ed anyr jealolify of their power. Almnot
all the generals who condufted his armies,
may be placed on a level with those illuffrious
-personages who have attained the highest emii
nence of military glory; and his advantages
ever his rivals, are to be aferibed to manlifeffly
to the superior abilities of the commanders
.whom he s~et in opposition to them, that
this might seem to detrad, in s~ome degree,
f~rom his owna merit, if the talent of dis~covering:

and ·bmployIing tch ifitrumients were not the

.Conference in order to peace.

The plenipotentiaries of France , Spain ,

and England , continued their conferences at:
Cercamp; and though each of them, with the
duial art of negociatorsJ made at first very high
demands in the name of their refpedtive courts,
yet as they were all equally desirous of peace,
they would have cont~ented reciprocally to such
abatements and reftridions of their claims, as
soft have removed every obflacle to an accom-
modation. The death of Charles V. was a new
motive with Philip to hasten the conclusion of
a treaty, as it incredfed his impatience for re-
turning into Spain, where there was now no
person greater or more illufkrious than hitnfelf.
But, in spite of the concurring withes of all
the parties interefied,, an event happened which
occalloned an unavoidable delay in their nego-
ciations.

Death of Mary of England.

About a month after the opening of the

conferences at Cercamp, MRary of England ended
her short and inglorious reign, (Nov. 1i~558*)
and Elizabeth, her fiffer, was imme ~lly pro-
claimed Queen by the English, with universal
joy. As the powers of the English plenipo-
tentiaries expiked on the death of their miff refs ,
they could not proceed until they received a
commillion and in Ordlfions from their new
i'overeign.

Henry and Philip court Elizabeth her successor.

Henry and Philip beheld E~lizabeth's eleva-

tion to the throne with equal solicitude. As
during Mlary's jealous adminiffration, under the
moth dilficult circumffances , and in a situation
extremely delicate, that Princess had conduaed
hers~elf with prudence and address far exceeding-
her years, they had conceived an high idea of
her abilities, and already formed expedtations
of a reign very differe~nt from that of her fiffer.
Equally feasible of the importance of gaining
her favour, both monarchs set themselves with
emulation to court it, and employed every art
ini order to insinuate themselves into her con-
fidence. Each of them had something merito-
rious, with regard to Elizabeth, to plead in his
own behalf. Henry had offered her a retreat in
his dominions, if the dread of her fifter's violence
thould force her to fly for safety but of Eng-
land. Philip, by his powerful intercefilon, had
prevented Mary from proceeding to the most
fatal extremities against her. Each of them
endeavoured now , to avail himself of the cir-
camftances in his favour. Henry wrote to Eli-
zabeth soon after her acceiron , with the warm-
eft excpreflions of regard and friends~hip. He
represented the war which had unhappily been
kindled between their kingdoms, not as a na-
:tional quarrel. but as the effeRt of Mary's blind

X2

partiality to het husband and fond compliance
ivith a~ll his witsihes. He entreated her to di~f-
engage herself from an alliance wvhich had prov-
ed so unfortunate to E:ngland 4 and to content;
to a fepparate peace with him, without mingl-
ing her interests with thofb of Spain i from
wvhich they ought now to be altogether disjoin-
ed. Philip 4 on the otheir hand , unwilling to~
los~e his connexion with England, the import-
ance of ·whichi during a rupture wiith France,
he had to recently experienced, not only vied
with Henry in declarations of efleem for Eli-
aabeth, and in profeirons of his resolution to
cultivate the firiffeft amity with her , but, its
order to confirm and perpetuate their unioni, he
offered hims~elf to her in marriage, and under-
took to procure a dispensation from the Pope to
tihat eife&.~

Elizarbeth's deliberatioris concerning her conduRt.

Elizabeth weighed the proposals of the

tivro IMonarchs attentively , ahd with that pro-
vident dikcerninlent of her trule inter~est, which
was conf~pienous in all her deliberations. She
gave some encouragement to Henry's overture
of a f'eparatte negociation, because it opened a
chainnel of correspondence with France, which
the might find to be of great advantage , if Phi-
lip thould not discover f~ufficient zeal and soli-
citude for fcuaring~ to her proper terms in the
joint treaty. But the ventured on this step with

thle most cautious reserve, that the might not
alarm Philip's Sfupicious temper, and lose art
ally in attempting to gain an enemy. z) Henry
himf'elf, by an unpardonable aft of indiferetion,
prevented her from carryving her intercourse
with him to such a lenght as might have offend-
ed or alienated Philip. At the very time when
he was courting Elizabeth's friendship with the
greatest affxduity, he yielded with an inconfi-
derate facility to the f~olicitations of the Princes
of Lorrain, and allowed his daughter-in-law the
Queen of Scots, to affame the title and arms
of Queen of England. This ill-timed preten-
sion, the source of many calamities to the un-
fortunate Qlueen of Scots, extinguished at once
all the c~onfidence that might have growrn be-
tween Henry and Elizabeth , and left in its
place diffruf~t, resentment, and antipathy. Eli-
zabeth found that t'he must unite her interests
closely withi Philip's, and expeft peace only
from negociations carried on in conjunation
with him. a)

She empowers her amnbaffadors to treat, of peace.
As the had granted a commiiron, immedia-

tely after her accefiion, to the fame ple~nipo-
tentiaries w~hom her fiffer had employed , the
now infird~ted them to a~ft in every point in

concert with the plenipotentiaries of Spain ,
and to take no flep until they had previonfly
cons~ulted with them. b) But though the deem-
ed it prudent to aff'ume this appearance of
confidence in the Spanish Monarch, the knew
precisely how far to carry it; and dircovered
no inclination to accept of that extraordinary
propofagl of marriage which Philip had made to
her. The English had expressed to openly their
deteffation of her fiffer's choice of him, that
it would have been highly imprudent to have
exasperated them by renewing that odious alli-
ance. She was too well acquainted with Phi-
lip's harsh imperious temper, to think of him
for a husband. Nor could she admit a difpen-
f'ation from the Pope to be fufficient to autho-
rize her marrying him, without condemning
her fath~er's divorce from Catharine of Arragon,
and acknowledging of consequence that her
mother's marriage was null, and her owin birth
illegitimate. But though the determined not to
yield to Philip's addresses, the situation of her
affairs rendered it dang~erous to reje~t them; the
returned her anfwver, therefore, in terms
which were~,evafive, but to tempered with re-
s~ped , that though they gave him no reas~on
to be secure of f~uccer~s, they did not altogether
extingulfh his hopes.

SNegociations at Chateau-Camnbregs.

By this artifice, as well as by the prtt-

dence with which t~he concealed her sentiments
and intentions concerning religion, for some
time after her acceflion, the so far gained
upon Philip, that he warmly espoused her in-
terest in the conferences which wJcere renewed
at Cercamp, and afterwards (February 6.
1559~) removed to Chateau-Cambrefis. A defi-
nitive treaty, which was to adjufk the claims
and pretenflons of so many Princes, required
the ezsamination of foch a variety of intricate
points, and led to such infinite and minute de-
tails, as drew out the negociations to a great
length. But the constable Mlontmorency exert-
ed himfelff with fach indefatigable zeal and in-
duffry, repairing alternately to the courts of
Paris and Brussels, in order to obviate or re-
move every difficulty, that all points in difputs
were adjusted at length in fuxch a manner, as
to give entire f~atisfaftion in every particular
to Henry and Philip; and the last hand was
ready to be put to the treaty between them.

Diffiiculties with regard to the claims of England.

The claims of England remained as the

only obstacle to retard it. Elizabeth demanded
the restitution of Calais in the most peremptory
tone, as an essential condition of her codfent-
ing to peace; Henry refused to give up that

Important conquest; and both f~eemned to have
taken their resolution with unalterable firmners.
Philip warmly supported Elizabeth's pretenflons
to Calais , not merely from a principle of equi-
ty towards the Eng-lish nation, that he might
appear to have contributed to their recovering
what they had 10ft by espousing his caure; nor
solely with a viewv of s~oothing Elizabeth by
this manifeitation of zeal for her interest, but
in order to render France less formidable, -byi
s~ecuring to her ancient enemy this eafjr access
into the heart of the kingdom. The earnest-
ness, howevert, with which he: seconded the
arguments of the E~nglish plenipotentiaries,
soon began to relax. During the courfie of the
negociation, Elizabeth, who now felt herfklf:
Firmly se~ated on her throne, began to take
fach open' and vigorous measures not only for
overturning~ all that her fiffer had done in favour
of popery, but for eftablithing the protefiant
church on a firm foundation, as convinced Phi-
lip that his hopes of an union with her had
been from the beginninig vain , and were now
desperate. From that period, his interpofitions
in her favour became more: cold and formal,
flowing merely from regard to decorum, or
friom the consideration of remotp political in-
terefts. Elizabeth, having reason to expe~t such
an alteration in his conduf~it, quikly perceived
it. But as nothing would have been of greater
detriment to her people, or more inconsistent

w~ith her ·schemes of domeftick adminiffration,
than t-he continuance of war, the saw the ne-
ceffily of submitting to fach con'ditions as the
situation of her af~fairs imposed, and that the
:tnu~it reckoq upon being deserted by an ally
whoo was now united to her by a very feeble
·tie, if the did not [peedily reduce her demands
to what was moderate and attainable. She

he thould forfeit five hundred thouraudc crowns,
for the payment of which fam, fgcven or eight

The views of both parties with~ refpedt to these.

Notwithstanding the fludied attention with

which so many precautions were taken, it is
evident that Henry did not intend the reftitu-

expedted it. It was hardly ppfllible that the

An expedient w~hich promotes peace between~ France

and Spain.

The expedient w~hich 1VMontmorency em-

ployed , in order to facilitate the conclusion of
peace between France and Spain, was the ne-
gociating twio treaties of marriage, one be-
tween Elizabeth, Henry's eldest daughter, and
Philip, w~ho supplanted his s~on, the unfortu-
nate Don Carlos, to whom that Princess had
been promis~ed in the former conferences at
Cercamp; the other between Margaret, Henry's
only fiffer, and the Duke of Savoy. For feeble

cord, which had to long embroiled the powerful
monarchs of France and Spain, which had tranf-
mitted hereditary quarrels and wars from Char-
les to Philip, and from Francis to Henry, ~seem-
ed! to be wholly removed , or finally terminat-
ed. The French alone comlplained of the une-
qual conditions of a treaty , into which an ambi-
tious minister, in order to recover his liberty,
.and an artful mifkrefs, that the might gratify
her resentment, had seduced their too easy mo-
narch. They exclaimed loudlysgainft the folly
ss giving· up to the enemies of France an hun-
dred and eighty-nine fortified places , in the Low
Countries or in Italy, in return for the three
insignificant towns of St. Quintin, Ha~m, and
Catelet. They considered it as an indelible slain
upon the glory of the nation, to renounce in
one day territor~ies to extensive, and to capable .
of being defended, that the enemy could not
have hoped to wrest them out of their hands ,
after many years of viatory and faccefs.

The peace between France and Spain ratified.

But Henry, without regarding the senti-

ments of his people, or being moved by the
remronftrances of his council , ratified the treaty ,
and executed with great fidelity whatever he
had si iulated to perform. The duke of Savoy
repaired with a numerous retinue to Paris , in
order to celebrate his marriage with Henry's
flfer. The duke of Alva was sent to the fame

6~apital, at the head of a splendid embairy, to
espouse Elizabeth in name of his master. They
were received with extraordinary magnificence
by the French court.

Death of Henry ii. and Paul IV.

AmidB the rejoicings and festivities on

that occaflon, Henry's days were cut thort (Jo
ly x 0. I559.) by a Aingular and tragical acci-
dent. H~is son, Francis II. a Prince under arge,
of a weak cons~titution, and of a mind Rill more
feeble , facceeded him. Soon after , Paul
ended his violent and imtperious Pontificate, at
enmity with all the world, and. dif'gufted even
wvith his own nephews. They, persecuted by
Philip and deserted by the facceeding Pope,
whom they had raised by their influence to the
papal throne, were condemned to the punish-
Ihnet which their crimes and ambition had me-
rited , and their death was as infamous as their
lives had been criminal. Thus most of the per-
fonages, who had long sustained the principal
chara~ters on the great theatre of Europe , dif-
appeared about the fame time. A more known
period of history opens at this sera; other a~tors
enter upon the stage, with different views, as
well as di~t~erent pairons; new contests arose,
and new fehemes of ambition occupied and dif~-
quieted mnankind.

A4 general review of the whole period.

Upon reviewing the tradfaftions of any

a~tive period in the hillory of civilized nations,

the ~changes :which are accomplished appeari
wonder~fully dif~proportiotted to the efforts which
have bee~n ex~erte~d. Cotxqulefts are never very:
extensive or rapid, but among nations who~e~
progrefrs in improvement is extremely unequal.

of fitites in this fituationl, depends not on a,
single battle. Their int~ernal re'fources are many
and various. * Nor are they themselves alone
interefied in their own safety , or a~t~ive in.
their own defence. Other states interpose,
and balance any temporary advantag~e which
either party may have acquired. After the

rival nations are exhausted, none are conlquered.
At length, a peace is concluded, which rein-
slates each in poffeflion of almost the fame

The nations of Europle in a (1milar state during the sixteenth

century.

Such was the state of Europe during the

reign of Charles VT. No Prince was to much
superior to the reft in power, as to render his
eff~orts irresistible, and his conqueits enlyr. No
nation had made progres~s in improvement to
far beyond its neighbours, as to have acquired
a very manifest pre-eminence. Each Rate de-
rived s~ome advtantage, or was fubjec't to fomze
inconvenience, ·fromn its situation or its climate;
each was distinguished by something peculiar
in the genius of its people, or the constitution
of its government. But the advantages poff~eff
ed by one Rtate, were counterbalanced by cir-
cumnitances favourable to others; and this pre-
vented any from attaining fach superiority as
might have been fatal to all. The nations of
Europe in that age, as in the present, were
like Qne great family; there were some features
common to all, which fixed a resemblance;
thete were certain peculiarities conspicuous in
each, which marked a diftin~tion. But there
was not among them that wide diversity of
chaira~ter and of genius which, in almost every
period of hiffory, had exalted the Europeans

His1. of Charl. V. Vol. IV. Y'

above the inh~abitants of the other quarters of
the globe, and seems to have destined the one
to rule, and the other to obey.

A remarkable change in the slate of Europe a during the

reign- of: Charles V7.

But though the near res~emblance and equa-

lity in improvement among the different nations
of Europe, prevented the reign of Charles V.
from being distinguished by fatch sudden and
extensive conquests as occur in force other pe-
riods of hiffory, yet,' during the course of his
adminiffrationj, all the confid erable slates in
Europe f~uffered a remarkable change in their
political situation, and felt the influence of
events, which have not hi~therto spent their force,
but still continue to operate in a ~greater or in
a less degree. It was .durin~g his reign, and
in cons~equence of the perpetual efforts to which
his enterprizing ambition rodaed him, that the
different kingdoms of Europe acquired internal
vigour; that- they discerned. the resources of
which they were poffeffTed ; that they came both
to feel their own fireng~th, and to know how
to render it formidable to others. It was during
his reign, too, that the different kingdoths of
Europe, formerly single and disjoined, became
so thoroughly acquainted , and to intimately
connefted with each other , as to form one
great political system, in which each took a
·iation , wherein it has remained since that

time with lets variation than could have been
expedted after the events of two adtive centuries.

than those of any other power, but more dif-
cernible and conspicuous. I have already enu-
inerated the vast: territories which descended to
Charles from his Auithian , Burgundian , and
Spanish anceffors. *) To these he himself add-
ed the Imperial dignity: and, as if all this had
bteen to little, the bounds of the habitable
globe seemed to be extended, and a new world
was faubjeated to his command. ULpon his re-
fignation, the Burgundian provinces, and the
Spanish kingdoms with their dependencies, both
in the old andi new worlds, devolved to Philip.
But Charles trans~mitted his domi~nions to his
son, in a condition very different from that in
which he had received them. They were aug-
mented by the accefizon of new provinces; they
were habituated to obey an adminiffration
which was no less vigorous than Ready; they
were accustomed to expensive and persevering
efforts, which, though necessary in the contests
between civilized nations, had been little known
in Europe before the sixteenth century. The
provinces of Friesland, Utrecht, and Overyffel,

'\hich he acquired by purchase from their for-
iner proprietors, and the dutchy of Gueldres,
of which he made hims~elf master, partly by
force of arms, partly by the arts of negociation,
w~ere additions of great value to his BurguLndian
dominions. Ferdinand and Ifiabella had tranf~-
initted to him all the! provinces of Spain, from
the bottom~ of the Pyrenees to the frontiers of
Portugal; but as he maintained a perpetual
peace with that kingdom, amidst the various
efforts of his enterprizing ambition, he made
no acquisition of territory in that quarter.

Particularly in Spain.

Charles had gained, however, a vast ad-

cef~lon of polver in this part of his dominions.
By his success in the war with the commons
o~f Castile , he exalted the regal prerogative
u~pon the ruins of the privileges which formerly
belonged to the people. Though he allowved
the name of~ the Cortes to remain, and the for-
mality of holding it to be continued , he re-
duced its authority and jurifdiition to isothing,
ind modelled it in foch a, mann~er, that it be-
camne rather a junto of the servants of the crown,
than ai> assembly of the representatives of the
people. One member of the conflitution being
thus lopped off, it was impossible but that the
other must feel the firoke , and f~uffer by it.
The fu~pprefilon of the popular power rendered
the ariftocratical less formidable. The grandees,

prompted by the warlike ipirit of the age, or
allared by the honours which they enjoyed in
a court, exhausted their fortunes in military
service, or in attending on the person of their

As Charles , by extending the royal prero-

gative, rendered the monarchs of Spain rnafters

at home, he

their crown by his foreign acquisitions. He
secured to Spain the quiet poffeilion of the king-.
dom of Naples, which Ferdinand had usurped
by fraud, and held with difficulty. He united
the dutchy of ~Milan , onse of the most fertile and
populous Italian provinces , to the Spanish
crown; and left his successors, even without
taking their other territories into the account,
the most considerable Princes in Italy, which
had been long the theatre of contention to the
great powers of Europe, and in which they
had firuggled with emulation to obtain the f~upe-
riority. When the French, in comformity to
the treaty of Chateau-Cambrefis, withdrew their
forces out of Italy, and finally relinquished all
their fehemes of conquest on that fide of the
Alps, the Spanish dominions then rose in im-
portance, and enabled their Kings, as long as
the monarchy retained any degree of vigfour,
to preserve the chief tway in all the tranf~a~ions
of that country. But whatever accellion either
of interior authority or of foreign dominion
Charles gained for the monarchs of Spain in
Europe, it was inconsiderable when compared
with his acquisitions in the new world. He
added there, not provinces, but empires to his
crown. He conquered territories of fuzch im-.
mens~e extent; he dis~covered s~uch inexhauffible
veins of wealth , and opened such boundlers
profpeats of every kind, as muff have routed
his fuxcceffor, and have called him forth to arc-

tion, though his ambition had been much les~s
ardent than Philip's, and must have rendered
him not only enterprizing but formidable.

Progress of the German btranch of thte hioufie of

A uftria.

Wlhile the elder branch of the Autrian fa-.

rnily rose to fach pre-eminence in Spain, the
younger, of which Ferdinand was the head,
grew to be considerable in Germany. The ancient:
hereditary dominions of the house of Austria in
Germany , united to the kingdoms of Hungary
and Bohemia, which Ferdinand had acquired
by marriage, formed a ref~pe~table power; and
Iwhen the Imperial dignity was added to ther'e,
Ferdinand poffeffed territories more extensive
than had belonged to any Prince, Charles V.
excepted, who had been at the head of the
Empire during several ages. Fortunately for
Europe, the disgust which Philip conceived on
a~ccount of Ferdinand's refusing to relinquish
the Imperial crown in his favour, not only pre-
vented for some time the separate members of
the house of Auffria fr-om a~tingf in concert, but
occasioned a visible alienation and rivalfhip~. By
degrees, however, regard to the interest of
their family ex~tinguished this impolitical animo-
fity. The confidence which was natural re-
turned; the aggrandizing of the house of Auffria
became the common obje~t of all their schemes;
they gave and received ai~ff~ifnce alternately

towards the execution of thlem; and each de-
rived confiderationl and importance from the
other's s~uccess. A family so great and to .afpir-
ing, became the general objeAt of jealousy and:
terror. All the power, as well as policy , of
Europe were exerted during a century, in order
to check~ and humble it. Nothing can give a
more fkriking idea of the as~cendant which it had
acquired, and of the terror which it had infpir-
ed , than that after its vigour was spent with
extraordinary exertions of its i1rength , after
Spain was become only the tha~dow of a great
aame, and its monarchs were funkr into debility
a~nd dotage, the house of Aufiria still continued
to be formidable. The nations of Europe had
so often felt its f'uperior power, and had been
so constantly employed in guarding against it,
that the dread of it became a. kind of political
habit, the influence of which remained when
the causes, which had formed it, ceas~ed to exist.

Acquisitions of the K~ings of France duringr the reign

of Charles V'.

W7hile the houre of Auffria went on with

such success in enlarging its dominions, France
made no considerable acquisition of new terri-
tory. All its schemes of conquest in Italy had
proved ab~ortive; it had hitherto obtained no
efiablif~hment of consequence in the new world;
and after the continued and vigorous e~fforts of
four faccellive: reigns, the confines of the king-

domn were much the fame as Louis XLI. had left
them. But though France made not fach large
firides towards dominion as the house ofAuffria,
it continued to advance by fieps which were
more secure , becaule they were gradual and
less oblerved. The conquest of Calais put it
out of the power of the English to invade France
but at their utmost peril, and delivered the
French from the dread of their ancient enemies ,
who, previous to that event, could at any time
penetrate into the kingdom by that avenue, and
thereby retard or defeat the execution of their
best concerted enterprizes against any foreign
power. The important acquisition of Mretz, co-
vrered that part of their frontier which formerly
was most feeble, and lay most expos~ed to insult.
France, from the time of its obtaining th~ere ad-
ditional s~ecurities against external invaflon , muff
be deemed the· most powerful kingdom in Eu-
rope, and is more fortunately situated than any
on the Continent either for conqueift or defence.
From the confines of "rtois to the bottom of the
Pyrenees, and from the British channel to the
frontiers of Savoyv and the coast of the Mediterr-
ranean, its territories lay compaBt and un-
mingled with those of any other power. Se-
veral of the considerable provinces, which had

became members of the Fame monarchy, they
assumed the s~entiments of that body· into which
they were incorporated, and rooperated with.
zeal towards promoting its interest a~nd honour.
The power and influence wirefted from the noJ
bles were feizedl by the crown. The people were
not: admitted to share in thes~e spoils; they gain-
ed no new privileges; they acquired on additional
weight in the legislature. It was not for the
fake of the people, but in order to extend their
own prerogative, that the monarchs of France had
laboured to humble their great vairals. Satisfied
with having brought them under entire fabjec-
tion to the crown, they dis~covered no solicitude
to free the people from their ancient dependence
on the nobles of whom they held.

Enables them to affitte an higher Rtation among the

powers of Europe.

A monarch, at the head of a kingdom thus

united at home anld secure from abroad , was
entitled to form great designs, because he felt
himself in a condition to execyte them. The
foreign wars which had continued with little
interruption from the accefilon of Charles VIII.
h~ad not only cherithed and augmented the mar-
tial gen~ius of thre nation, but by inuring the
'troops during the cours~e of long s~ervice to the
fatigues of war, and accuffoming them to obe-
dience, had added the force of dis~cipline to their

matural ardour. A gallant and adtive body of
nobles, who considered themnfelves as idle and
ufelers, unles~s when they were in the field;
who were hardly acquainted with any pastime
or exercif~ie but what was military; and who
knew· no road to power, or fame, or wealth,
but war, would not have fuffered their sovereign
to remnain long in ina~tion. The people, little
acquainted with the arts of peace, and always
read y to take arms at the command of their fu-
periors, were accuffomed, by the vast: expence
of long wars carried on in distant countries, to
bear impositions, which, however inconfider-
able they may feemn if estimated by the exor-
bitant rate of modern exa~tions, appear immense
when compared with the sums levied in France,
or in any other country of Europe, previous
to the reign of Louis XI. As all the members
of which the state was composed were thus im-
patient for acdion , and capable of great efforts,
the schemes and operations of France must have
been no les~s formidable to Europe than those of
Spain. The superior advantages of its situation ,
the contiguity and compaanefs of its territories,
together with the peculiar slate of its political
constitution at that jun~ture, must have rendered
its enterprizes still more alarming and more de-
cifive. The King poffeffed fa~ch a degree of
power as gave him the entire command of his
f~ubjefts ; the people were strangers to thof~ie
occupations and habits of life which render men

sverfe to war, or unfit for it; and the nobles,
though reduced to the fabordination necessary
in a: regular government, kill retained the high
undaunted spirit which was the effeat of their
ancient independence. The vigour of the Feudal
times remained, thleir anarchy; was at an end;
and the KEing~s of France could avail themselves
of the snartial ar-dour which that singular initi-
tutioq had kindled or kept alive, without being
exposed to any of the dangers or inconveniencies
which are inseparable from it when in entire
force,

Circumitanes: which prevented the immediate effe~ts of

their power.

A kingdom in such a itate is,, perhaps, ca-

pable of greater military efforts than at any
other period in its progres~s. But how formi-
dable soever or fatal to thie other nations of 3Eu-
rope the power of sauch a monarchy might have
been, the civil wars which broke- out in F~rance
saved them at that jun~ture from feeling its
effe~ts. TherCe wars, of which religion was
the pretextt and ambition .the caule, wherein
great abilities were displayed by the leaders of
the different fadtious, and little condua or
firmness were manifested by the crown under a
faucedia~n of: weak Princes, kept France occu-
pled and embroiled for half a century. During
ther~e commotions the internal firength of the
kingdom was much waited , and fach a spirit

es anarchy was spread among the nobles, to
whom rebellion was familiar, and the refaraint
of laws unknown , that a considerable interval
became requisite not only for recruiting the in-
ternal vigour of the nation, but for re-eftablith-
ing the authority of the Prince; so that it was
long before France could turn her whole atten-
tion towards foreign tranfa8~ions, or aft with
her proper force in foreign w:ars. It was long
before the rose to that as~cendant in Europe
wthich the has maintained since th-e admoiniftrra-
tion of Cardinal Richelieu, and which the fitua-
tion as well as extent of the kingdom, the na.
ture of her government, together with the chas
raft~er of her people , entitle her to maintain.

~Henry VII. had begun. The pride and caprice
of his temper led him to employ chiefly new·
men in the administration of a~Tairs, because he
found them most obl~equious, or least fecru-
pulous; and he not only conferred on them fsch

Power and influence accompanied of course the

Changes in the political Rtate of the recondary powers

in Europe.

During the period in which the political

slate of the great kingdoms underwent s~uch
changes, revolutions of considerable importance
happened in that of the secondary or inferior
po wers.

The mnoft confiiderable revolution of the Cixteenth

century in the court of Rome.

The general re volt against the doarines of the church

of Rore, and the power of the Popes.

Luther had attacked the Papal fbpremacy-

with other weapons, and with an impetuosity
more formidable. The time and manner of his
attack concurred with a multitude of circum-
stances, which have been explained , in giving
him immediate faccefs. The charm which had
bound mankind for to many ages was broken
at once. The human mind, which had conti-
nued long as tame and passive, as if it had
been formed to believe whatever was taught.
and to bear whatever was imposed, routed of
sudden, and became inq~uisitive, mutinous, and
dif'dainful of the yoke to utich it had hitherto
submitted. That wonderful fermen~t and agi-a-
·tion of mind, wh~ich, at this difrance of time,
appears unaccountable, or is candemn~ed as ex-
travagant, was to general, that it muf't hav·e
been excited by cauf'es which were natural and
of powerful effcacy. The kingdoms ofDen-
mark, Sweden, England and Scotland, and
almost one half of Germany, threw off their
allegiance to the Pope, abolished his juridi~tion
within their territories, and gavre the fan~tion
of law to modes of discipline and .systems of
do~trine which wrere no-t only in-dependent of

his power, but hoitile to it.. N6`r was this
spirit of innovation confined to those countries
which openly revolted from the Pope; it f'pread
through all Europe, and broke out in every
part of it with various degrees of violence. It
peneftrated early into France, and made pro-
grefs apace. ·In that kingdom , the number of
converts to the opinions of the Reformers was
so great, their zeal so enterprizing, and the
abilities of their leaders so diftingulf~hed , that
they soon ventured to contend for superiority
with the eftabliifhed church , and were s~ome-
times on the point of obtaining it. In all the
provinces of Germany which continued to ac-
knowledge the Papal supremacy, as well as in the
Low Countries, the Protestant dor~rines were
s~ecretly taught, and had gained to many pro-
felytes , that they were ripe for revolt, and
were restrained merely by the dread of their
rulers from imitating the example of their neigh-
bours, and asserting their independence. Even
in Spain and in Italy , symptoms of the fame
dif~pofitionl to shake off the yoke appeared. The
pretenflons of the Pope to infallible knowledge
and supreme power were treated by many per-
sons of eminent learning and abilities wlith such
scorn, or impugned ith fach vehemence, that
the mo ft vigilant attention of the civil mag~if-
trate, the highest frains of pontifical -autho-
rity, and all the rigolir of inquisitorial jurifdiaion
were requisite to check and extinguith it.

This abridged the extent of the Pope's dominions,

The defe~tion of so many opulent and

powerful kingdoms from the Papal See, was
a fatal blow to its grandeur and power. It
abridged the dominions of the Popes in extent,
it diminished their revenues, and left them
fewer rewards to beffow on the ecclefiaft~icks
of various denominations, attached to them by
vows of obedience as well as by ties of interest,
and wrhom they employed as infiruments to
eftablifk or s~upport their ufurpations in every
part of Europe. The countries too which now
disclaimed their authority, were those which
formerly had been most devoted to it. The
empire of su~perstition differs from every other
species of dominion; its power is often greatest,
and most implicitly obeyed in the provinces
most remote from the feat of government; while
such as are situated nearer to that, are more
apt to dis~cern the artifices by which it is up-
held , or the impoftures on which it is founded.
The personal frailties or vices of the Popes, the
errors as well as corruption of their adminif~-
tration , the ambition, venality, and deceit
w·hich reigned in their courts, fell immediately
under the observation of the Italians, and could
not fail of diminishing that refpe~t which begets
f~ubmifliion. But in Germany, England, and
the more remote countries, ther~e were either
altogether unknown, or being only known by

report, made a slighter impression. The vene-
ration for the Papal dignity increated with their
distance from Rome; and that, added to their
gross ·ignorance, rendered them equally cre-
dulous and pafirve, In tracing: the progress of
the Papal domination , the boldest and most
fuccefslful inflances of encroachment are to be
found in Germany and other countries difiant
from Italy. In there its impoiitions were hea-
vieft, and its exa~tions the most rapacious; so
that in estimating the dimilnution of power
which the court ofRlome fuffered in cons~equence
of the Reformation , ot: only th e number but
the chara~er of the people who revolted, not
only the great extent of territory, but the ex-
traordinary obfequiouf~ners of the fulbjefas which
it loft, muff be taken into the account.

An1d obliged! them to change the Spir~it of their government,

Nor was it only by this defe~tion of so

many kingdoms and slates which the Reforma-
tion occasioned , that it contributed to diminish
the power of the Roman Pontifsf It obliged
themh to adopt a different ijyftem of conduRt
towar~ds the nations which still continued to
recognis~e their jurif~di~ion, and to govern them
by new maxims and with a milder spirit. The
Reformation taught them, by a fatal example,
what they ~seem not before to have apprehend-
ed, that the credulity and patience of mankind
might be overburdened and exhauffed. They

became afraid of venturing upon any such exer-
tion of their authority as might alarm or exasperate
their faubjeatS, and excite them to a new revolt.
They saw~ a rival church eftablif~bed in many
countries of Europe, the members of ·which
were on the watch to observe any errors in
their administration, and eager to expefe them.
They were sensible that the opinions, ad verse
to their power and ufurpations, were not con-
fined to their enemies alone, but had fpr ead
even among the people who still adhered to
them. Upon all thes~e accounts, it was no
longer poiffble to lead or to govers their flock
in the fame manner: as in those dark and quiet
ages, when faith was implicit, when fubmiiron
was unrefierved, and all tamely followed and
obeyed the voice of their thepherd. From the
aera of the Reformation, the Popes have ruled
rather by address and management than by au-
thority. The style of their decrees is the fame,
but the e~ffeR of them is very different. Thos~e
Bulls and Interdi~ts wvhich, before the Refor-
mation , made the greatest Princes tremble,
have since that period been disregarded or de-
fpifed by the moit inconsiderable. Those bold
decisions and aifts of jurif'di~ion which, during
many ages, not only passed uncentured , but
were revered as the awards of a sacred tribunal,
wvould, since Luther's appearance, be treated
by one part of Europe as the effe~t of folly or
arrogance, and be detefied by the other as imn-

pious and unjust. The Popes, in their add-l,
niffration, have been obliged. not only to ac-
com~modate thems~elves to the notions of their
adherents, but to pay some regard to the pre-
judices of their enemies. They· seldom venture
to claim- new powers, or even to insist obfti-
nately on their ancient prerogatives, left they
s~hould irritate the former; they carefu~lly avoid
every meafatre that may either excite the indi-
gnation or draw on them the deriflon of the
latter. The policyt of the court of Romne has
become as cautious, circumfpedt, and timid,
as it was once adventurous and violent; and
though their pretenflons to infallibility, on
which all their authority is founded, does not
allow them to renounce any jurisdlaion which
they have at any time claimed or exercised`,
they find it expedient to f~uffer many of their
prerogatives to lie dormant, and not to expofPLe
themselves to the rifqpue of losing that remainder
of power, which they still enjoy, by ill-timed
attempts towards reviving obsolete pretensions.
Before the sixteenth .century, the Popes were
the movers and direffors in every considerable
enterprize; they were at the head of every
great alliance ; and being considered as arbiters
in the affairs of Chriffendom, the court ofi
Rome was the centre of political negociation
and intrigue. From that time, the greatest
operations in Europe have been carried on inde-
pendent of them; they have funk almost to a

Italy;

they continue to claim, though they dare not
exercise, the fame sp~iritual jurifdi~tion, but
hardly retain any thadow of the temporal power
which they anciently poffeffekd,

The Reformation contributed to improve the church

both in science and mnorals.

But howy fatal soever the Reformattion may

have been to the pow~er of the Popes, it con-
tributed to impro~ve the church of Rome both
in science and in morals. The desire of equalling

talents wvhich had
neceflity of acquir-

th'e r~eformners in those

change no l~e
t'he RJomnith cl~ The f~ame prinlciple occasioned a

fs considerable in the mnorals of
erg~y. V~arious causes which have

formerly been enumerated , had concurred in

great irregularity, and even diff~o-

introducing
lation of manners among the popith clergy.
Luther and his adherents began their attack
on the chur~ch with such vehement invehtives

against there, that, in order to reinove the
Scandal, and silence their declamations, greater
decency of condua became necessa8ry. The
Reformers themselves were t~o eminent not
only for the purity but even austerity of their
manners, and had acquired such reputation
among the people on that account, that the
Roman Catholick Clergy must have soon loft
all credit, if they had not endeavoured to con-
form in some meas~ure to their sta~ndard. They
kinew that all their arlfions fell under the severe
inf~pe~ion of the Protefkants, whom enmity and
emulation prompted to obs~erve every vice , or
even impropriety in their condedt; to censure
them without indulgence, and to expose them
without mercy. This rendered them, of course,
not only cautions to avoid such enormities as
might give offence, but studious to acquire the
virtues which might merit praise. In Spain
and Portugal, where the tyrannical juridi~ci~ion
of the Inquisition crushed the Protestant faith
as froon as it appeared, the spirit of Popery
continues invariable; ~science has made s~mall
progres~s, and the charadter of ecclefiafticks
has undergone little change. But in those
countries where the members of the two chur-
chles have mingled freely with each other, or
have carried on any considerable intercourse,
either commercial or litterary, an extraordinary
alteration in the ideas, as well as in the mo-
rals of the Popith ecclefiafticks, is m40ifeft. In

France , the manners of the Dignitaries and fe-
cular clergy have become decent and exemplary
in an high degree. Many of them have been
distinguished for all the accomplishments and
virtues which can adorn their profeiaron; and
differ greatly from their predecess~ors before the
Reformation, both in their maxims and in their
cond uA.

The effeats of it extend to the chara~ter of the Popes

themse~lves.

Nor has the influence of the Reformation

been felt only by the inferior members of the
Roman Catholick Church; it has extended to
the See of Rome, to the sovereign Pontifs
themselves. Violations of decorum, and even
trefpalles againf1 morality , which passed w~ith-
out cedfure in those ages, wh7en neither the
pow~er of the Popes, nor the veneration of the
people for their charadter, had any· bounds;
when there was no hoffile eye to obfierve the
errors in their condu&t, and no adversaries
zealous to inveigh against them ; would be liable
now to the severest animnadverflon, and ex--
cite general indignation or horror. In-;tead of
rivalling the courts of temporal Princes in
g-aiety , and f~urpair~ng them in licentiousness,
the Popes have fludied to affiume manners more
f'evere and more fa~itable to their ecclesiastical
ch ara~ier. The chair of St. Peter hath not
been polluted , during tw-o centuries, by any

Pontif that resembled Alexanider VI. or iAive-
ral of his predecefrors, who were a disgrace to
religion and to] human nature. Throughout-
this long fauccefilon of Popes, a wonderful de-
corum: of conduff, compared with that: of pre-
ceding ages, is observable. MVany of them have
been conspicuo~us for the virtues becoming their
high fArtion ; and by their humanity, their
love ·of litterature, andi their mod.eration, have
rnade ~some atonemnen~t; to mnankrind for the cri-
mes of their predecessors. Thus the beneficial
influences of the Refo~rmation have been more
exten~sive than they appear on a superficial
view; and this great diviflon in the Christian
church hath contributed, in s~ome meafare, to
increase purity of manners, to diffufe science,
and to inspire humanity. Hiffory recites such
a number offhoocking events , occasioned by reli-
gious dissensions, that it must afford peculiar
fatisfa~ion to trace any o~ne f'alutary or bene-
ficial effe&t to that so~urce, from which so many
fatal calamities have flowed.

State of the r~epublick of Venice.

The republick of Venice, which, at the

bleginning of the sixteenth century, had appear.
ed to formidable, that almost all the potenta-·
tes of Europe united in a confederacy for its
deftrudion, declined gradually from its ancient
power and splendor. The Venetians not only
10ft a great part of their territory in the war

the re-

excited by the league of Cambray, but

as well as vigour of the slate were ex-

ven ues
haufted by their exrtraordinary and long conti-

their own defence; and that

nued effort~s in
commerce by which they had
wealth and power began to d
any hopes of its reviving. Al acquired their

ecay, w~ithout
l1 the fa tal con-

sequences to their republick, which the fargacity
of the Venetian fTenate forefawv on the f~irt dif-
covery of a passage to the ~E~af-Indies by the
Cape of Go~od Hope, took place. Their endea-
vours to prevent the Portuguese from eftablith-
ing themselves in
exciting the Sold; the Eaft-Indies, not only by

ns of Egypt, and the Otto-
a

man monarchs, to turn their arms against fach
dangerous intruders, but by affording secret
aid to the Infidels in order to infutre their fauc-
ces~s, z) proved ineffe~tual. The a~tivity and

Portuguese surmounted every ob-

valour of thie
ftacle, and obtained such firm footing in that
fertile country, as fcured to them large poi~ef~-
fions, together with influence still more exten-

of Venice, became the

fatal to inferior branches of their commerce.
The original defe~ts which were formerly
pointed out in the confitation of the Venetian
republickr continued, and the disad~vantages
with which it undertook any great enterprize,
increas~ed rather than diminished. The sources
from which it derived its extraordinary riches
and power being dried up, the interior vigour
·of the state declined, and of course, its ex-
ternal operations became leifs formidable. Longp
before the middle of the sixteenth century,
Venice ceased to be one of the principal
powers in Europe, and dwindled into a s~econdary
and f~ubtaltern slat~e. But as the sen~ate had the
addres~s to conceal its diminution' of power,
utnder the veil of moderation and caution; as
it mad~e no rash~ eff~ort that could dis~cover its
impotence; as the symptoms of political decay
in slates are not soon obf'erved, and are f'eldomn
fob apparent to their neighbours as to occasion
any s~udden alteration 11£ their conduft towards
-them, Venice crontinued. long to be considered
and ref'pedted. She was treated not according
to her present: condition, but according to the
rank which thee had formerly held. Charles
V. as well as thfe monarchs of France, his
rivals, court~ed 'her alifiiance with emulation
and solicitude in all their enterprizes. Even
down to the cl-ose of the century, Venice re-
mained not only an obje~t of attention, but a

considerable feat of political negSociation and
Intrigu e.

Of Tutcany.

That authority which the first Cosmo di

Medici, and Lawrence, his grandson, had ac-
quired in the republickr of Florence by their
beneficence and abilities, inspired their des~cend-
-ants with the ambition of ufurping the sorer-
eignty in their country, and paved their way
towards it. Charles placed Alexander di Me-
dici (I550.) at the head of the republick, and
to the natural interest and power of the family
added the weight as well as credit of the Im-
perial prote~tion. Of there, his f~ucceffior Cosmo,
fxrnamed the Great, availed himself; and effa-
blithing his supreme authority on the ruins of
the ancient republican constitution , he tranf~-
mitted that, together with the title of Grand
Duke of Tus~cany, to his des~cendants. Their
dominions were composed of the territories
which had belonged to the three commonwealths
of Florence, Pisa, and Siena, and formed one
of the most refpe~t~able of the Italian Rtates.

Of the dukes of Savoy.

The dukes of Savoy, during~ the former

part of the sixteenth century, poirefed territo-
ries which were not considerable either for ex-
tent or value; and the French , havingr seized

the greater part of thern, obliged the reigning
Duke to retire for safety to the fkrong fortress
of Nice, where he shut himself up for several
years; while his fbn, the Prince of Piedmont,
endeavoulred to better his fortune, by serving
as an adventurer in the armies of Spain. The
peace of Chateau Cambrefis reffored to him his
paternal dominions. As these are environed. on
every hand by powerful neighbours , all whose
motioins the dukes of Savoy muff observe with
the greatest attention, in order not only to
guard against the danger of being su~rprised and
overpowered, but thaC they: may chuf~e their
fide with dilcernment in those quarrels where~in
it is impoilible for them to avoid taking part,
this peculiarity in their situation feerns to have
had no inconsiderable influence on their cha-
raater. By rousing them to perpetual attention,
by keeping their ingenuity always on the stretch,
and engaging them in almost continual aftion ,
it hath formed a race of Princes more fatgacious
in dis~covering their true interest, more decisive
in their resolutions, and more dexterous in
availing themselves of every occu~rrence wh~ich
presented itself, than any perhaps that: can be
singled out in the hiffory of mankind. By gra-
dual acquisitions the Dukes of Savoy have added
to their territories, as wKell as~ to their own im-
portance; and aspiring at length to regal dignity,
which they obtainaeed about hlalf a century ago,

they

they hold no inconsiderable rank among the mo-
narchs of Europe.

Of the United P~rovinces.

The territories which now form the repu,

blick of the United Nietherlands, wyere loft d ur-
ing the firit part of the sixteenth century, among
the numerous provinces fabje~t to the house of
A-uffria; and w~ere then s~o inconsiderable, that
hardly one opportunity of mentioning them hath
occurred in all the bufyi period of this history.
But soon after the peace of Chateau Cambrefis,
the violent and bigoted maxims of Philip's go-
vernment, carried into execution with unre-
lenting rigour by the duke of Alva, exasperated
the free people of the Low- Countries to fach a.
degree, that they threw off the Spanish yoke,
and af7~erted their ancient liberties and law~s.
There they defended wyith a persevering valour,
whichl occupied the arms of Spain during half
a century, exhausted the vigour, ruined the re-
putation of that monarchy ,and at last constrain--
ed their ancient masters to recognize and to treat:
w~ith them aIs a free independent Rtate. This
state, fouinded on liberty, and reared by in-
duftry and oeconomy, had grown into reputa-
tion, even while struggling for its exiffence.
But when peace and sec~urity allowed it to en-
larg·e its views, and to extend its commerce,
it role to be one of the most refpe~table as w-ell
as enterprizing powers in Europe.

In Denmark and Sweden, during the reign

their constitutions, civil as well as ecclefiafrical.
In the former kingdom, a tyrant being degraded
from the throne, and expelled the country, a

people to assume the reins of government.
the latter, a fierce people, routed to arms byT
injuries and opprefllon, thook off the Danish
yoke, and conferred the regal dignity on its

virtues of a hero and of a patriot. Denmark,
