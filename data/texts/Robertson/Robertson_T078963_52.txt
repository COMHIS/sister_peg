Not only ambition, but avarice, had urged Velasquez to haften of Velasquez

for invading

his preparations; and having such a profpet of gratifying both, New Spain.
he had advanced considerable fums out of his private fortune
towards defraying the expence. At the fame time, he exerted
his influence as governor, in engaging the mofi distinguished
persons in the colony to undertake the service . At a time
when the spirit of the Spanifll nation was adventurous to ex-
cess, a number of soldiers, eager to embark in any daring en-
terprife, oon appeared. But it was not so easy to find a person
qualified to take the command in an expedition of so much im-
portance; and the character of Velasquez, who had the right
of nomination, greatly increascd the difficulty of the choice.

vigour and ativity of mind, as to undertake in person the con-
duct of the armament which he was preparing. In this embar-
raffing situation, he formed the chimerical scheme not only of at-
chieving great exploits by a deputy, but offecuring to himself the
glory of conquests which were to be made by another. In the
execution of this plan, he fondly aimed at reconciling contradic-
tions. He was solicitous to chute a commander of intrepid
resolution, and of superior abilities, because he knew these to
be requisite in order to ensure success; but, at the fame time,
from the jealousy natural to little minds, he wished him to be
of a spirit so tame and obsequious, as to be entirely dependant
on his will. But when he came to apply those ideas in form-
ing an opinion concerning the several officers who occurred to
his thoughts as worthy of being entrusted with the command,
he oon perceived that it was impoflible to find such incom-
patible qualities united in one character. Such as were dillin-
guifhed for courage and talents were too high-fpirited to be
patfive inflruments in his hand. Those who appeared more
gentle and tractable, were destitute of capacity, and unequal to
the charge. This augmented his perplexity and his fears. He
deliberated long, and with much solicitude, and was still waver-
ing in his choice, when Amador de Lares, the royal treasurer
in Cuba, and Andres Duero, his own secretary, the two per-
sons in whom he chiefly confided, were encouraged by this ir-
relblution to propose a new candidate, and supported their re-
commendation with such assiduity and address, that, no less
fatally for Velasquez than happily for their country, it proved
successful

derate fortune. Being originally defined by his parents to the
fludy of law, as the most likely method of bettering his con-
dition, he was ent early to the university of Salamanca, where
he imbibed some tincure of learning. But he was ibon dif-
gufled with an academic life, which did not suit his ardent and
restless genius, and retired to Medellin, where he gave himself
up entirely to aive sports and martial exercises. At this pe-
riod of life, he was so impetuous, so overbearing, and so diffi-
pated, that his father was glad to comply with his inclination,
and fend him abroad as an adventurer in arms. There were
in that age two conspicuous theatres, on which such of the
Spanish youth as courted military glory might display their va-
lour; one in Italy, under the command of the Great Captain;
the other in the New World. Cortes preferred the former,
but was prevented by indisposition from embarking with a re-
inforcement of troops ent to Naples. Upon this disappoint-
ment he turned his views towards America, whither he was
allured by the profped of the advantages which he might de-
rive from the patronage of Ovando , the governor of Hifpa-
niola, who was his kinfinan. When he landed at St. Domingo
in one thousand five hundred and four, his reception was such
as equalled his most sanguine hopes, and he was employed by
the governor in several honourable and lucrative flations.
These, howevcr, did not satisfy his ambition; and in the year
one thousand five hundred and eleven, lie obtained pcrmiflion
to accompany Diego Vclafijuez in his expedition to Cuba. In

B 0o0 K this service he distinguished himself so mucl, that, notwith-
<-Nv standing some violent contests with Velafqucz, occasioned by

trivial events, unworthy of remembrance, he was at length
taken into favour, and received an ample conceiflon of lands
and of Indians, the recompence uually bellowed upon adven-
turers in the New World d

THOuc;H Cortes had not hitherto aed in high command,

he had displayed such qualities in several scenes of difficulty
and danger, as raised universal expectation, and turned the eyes
of his countrymen towards him, as one capable of performing
great things. The turbulence of youth, as oon as he found
objects and occupations suited to the ardour of his mind, gra-
dually subsided, and fettled into a habit of regular indefatigable
activity. The impetuosity of his temper, when he came to at
with his equals, insensibly abated, by being kept under re-
firaint, and mellowed into a cordial soldierly frankness. These
qualities were accompanied with calm prudence in concerting
his schemes, with persevering vigour in executing them, and
with what is peculiar to superior genius, the art of gaining the
confidence and governing the minds of men. To all which
were added the inferior accomplishments that firike the vulgar,
and command their rcfpedt; a graceful person, a winning as-
fpc, extraordinary address in martial exercises, and a confli-
tution of such vigour as to be capable of enduring any fatigue.

As oon as Cortes was mentioned to Velasquez by his two

confidents, he flattered himself that he had at length found
what he had hitherto fought in vain, a man with talents for
command, but not an objct ofjealouy. Neither the rank nor

aspire at independence. He had reason to believe, that by his -

as his liberality in conferring several recent favours, he had al-
ready gained the good-will of Cortes, and hoped, by this new
and unexpeaed mark of confidence, that he might attach him
for ever to his interest.

sions of refpea and gratitude to the governor, immediately i,,m"5 o
ereaed his standard before his own houle, appeared in a mili- Oaober z.-
tary dress, and assumed all the ensigns of his new dignity.
-lis utmost influence and ativity were exerted in persuading
many of his friends to engage in the service, and in urging
forward the preparations for the voyage. All his own funds,
together with what money he could raise by mortgaging his
lands and Indians, were expended in purchasing military ftorcs
and provisions, or in supplying the wants of such of his officers
as were unable to equip therfilves in a manner suited to their
rank . Inoffensive, and even laudable as this conduct was,
his disappointed competitors were malicious enough to give it a
turn to his disadvantage: They represented him as aiming al-
ready, with little disguise, at cfltalifhing an independent au-
thority over his troops, and endcavouriog to fccure their
refpca or love by his oftcntatious and interefled liberality.
They reminded Velasquez of his former difienfions with the
man in whom he now reposed so much confidence, and fore-
told that Cortes would be more apt to avail hiinfelf of the
power, which he was inconsiderately putting in his hands, to,

Velasquez, that Cortes soon observed some symptoms of a
growing alienation and difiruft in his behaviour, and was ad-
vised by his friends, Lares and Duero, to haflen his departure,
before these should become so confirmed, as to break out with
open violence. Fully sensible of this danger, he urged forward
his preparations with such rapidity, that he set fail from St.
Jago de Cuba on the eighteenth of November, Velasquez ac-
companying him to the hore, and taking leave of him with an
appearance of perfect friendlhip and confidence, though he had
secretly given it in charge to some of his officers, to keep a
watchful eye upon every part of their commander's condua f.

to dcplive
him o his fame fide o the island, where he was joined by several ad-
conlfIon, venturers, and received a supply of provisions and military

stores, of which his flock was still very incomplete. He had
hardly left St. Jago when the jealousy which had been work-
ing in the breast of Velasquez, grew so violent that it was im-
possible to suppress it. The armament was no longer under
his own eye and direcion; and he felt that as his power over
it ceased, that of Cortes became more absolute. Imagination
now aggravated every circumstance, which had formerly ex-
cited fufti cion: the rivals of Cortes indutlrioufly threw in re-
flc-iions which increased his fears; and with no less art than
malice they called fuperflition to their aid, employing the pre-
dilions of an afirologer in order to complete the alarm. All
thee, by their united operation, produced the desired cffect.

Velasquez repented bitterly of his own imprudence, in having 1 °o° K
committed a trust of so much importance to a person whose ,----
fidelity appeared so doubtful, and hastily dispatched instruCtions
to Trinidad, empowering Verdugo, the chief magiflrate there,
to deprive Cortes of his commission. But Cortes had already
made such progress in gaining the esteem and confidence of his
troops, that, finding officers as well as soldiers equally zealous
to support his authority, he oothed or intimidated Verdugo,
and was permitted to depart from Trinidad without mo-
leftation.

FROM Trinidad Cortes failed for Havana, in order to raise and to lay

him under

more soldiers, and to complete the victualling of his fleet. arrest.
There several persons of diflintion entered into the service,
and engaged to supply what provisions were flill wanting; but
as it was ncceflary to allow them ome time for performing
what they had promised, Velasquez, sensible that he ought no
longer to rely on a man of whom he had so openly dicfovered
his difiruit, availed himself of the interval, which this un-
avoidable delay afforded, in order to make one attempt more to
wrefl the command out of the hands of Cortes. He loudly
complained of Verdugo's conduct, accusing him either of
childilh facility, or of manifest treachery, in fuflcring Cortes
to escape from Trinidad. Anxious to guard against a second
(lifappointment, he sent a pcrlbn of confidence to the Hlava-
na, with peremptory injuntions to Pedro Barba, his licutc-
nant-govcrnor in that colony, inflantly to arrefi Cortes, to
find him prisoner to St. Jago under a firong guard, and to.
countermand the departure of the armament until lie flould
receive farther orders : He wrote likewise to the principal offi-
ccrs, requiring them to assist Barba in executing what he had

dition.

attachment to Velasquez, he could not confide in this trying
and delicate jundcure. He gave him the command of a vessel,
deflined to take on board ome provisions in a finall harbour
beyond Cape Antonio, and thus made sure of his abfencc,
without seeming to fufpet his fidelity. When he was gone,
Cortes no longer concealed the intentions of Velasquez from
his troops ; and as officers and soldiers were equally impatient
to set out on an expedition, in preparing for which most of
them had expended all their fortune, they expressed their alto-
nifhment and indignation at that illiberal jealousy, to which
the governor was about to sacrifice, not only the honour of their
general, but all their sanguine hopes of glory and wealth.
With one voice they intreated that he would not abandon the
important flation to which he had such a good title. They
conjured him not to deprive them of a leader whom they fol-
lowed with fhch well-founded confidence, and offered to shcd
the last drop of their blood in maintaining his authority. Cortes

quota of men and provi sions; though the governor had laid
out considerable fitms, and each adventurer had exhausted his

was such as must astonish the present age, and bore, indeed, no
refeimblance to an armament destined for the conquest of a
great empire. The fleet confifled of eleven vessels; the largest
of a hundred tons, which was dignified with the name of Ad-

and a hundred and nine were seamen or artificers. The fol-
diers were divided into eleven companies, according to the

tain, nd committed to him the command of the vessel while
at sea, and of the men when on flore . As the use of fire-

As religious enthusiasm always mingled with the spirit of ad-
venture in the New World, and, by a combination fill more
strange, united with avarice, in prompting the Spaniards to all
their enterprises, a large cross was displayed in their standards,
with this inscription, Let usfollow the cross, Jar under this
ign weJhall conquer.

So powerfully were Cortes and his followers animated with

both there passions, that, no less eager to plunder the opulent
country whither they were bound, than zealous to propagate
the Christian faith among its inhabitants, they set out, not with
the solicitude natural to men going upon dangerous service,
but with that confidence which arises from security of success,
and certainty of the divine protection.
Touches at As Cortes had determined to touch at every place which Gri-

jalva had visited, he fleered diretly towards the island of Co-
zumel; there he had the good fortune to redeem Jerome de
Aguilar, a Spaniard, who had been eight years a prisoner among
the Indians. This man was perfectly acquainted with a dia-
leal of their language, understood through a large extent of

country, and poffefting besides a considerable hare of prudence B 0o o
and sagacity, proved extremely useful as an interpreter. From -
Cozumel, Cortes proceeded to the river ofTabafco, in hopes March .
of a reception as friendly as Grijalva had met with there, and and at Ta-
of finding gold in the fame abundance; but the disposition of
the natives, from rome unknown cause, was totally changed.
After repeated endeavours to conciliate their good-will, he was
constrained to have recourse to violence. Though the forces
of the enemy were numerous, and advanced with extraordinary
courage, they were routed, with great slaughter, in several
successive actions. The loss which they fulltained, and flill
more the astonishment and terror excited by the deftrudive
effeEt of the fire-arms, and the dreadful appearance of the
horses, humbled their fierce spirits, and induced them to sue
for peace. They acknowledged the king of Caflile as their
sovereign, and granted Cortes a supply of provisions, with a
present of cotton garments, ome gold, and twenty female
slaves '.

CORTES continued his course to the westward, keeping as Arrives at St.

but could discover no proper place for landing, until he arrived
at St. Juan de Ulua . As he entered this harbour, a large ca- April z.
noe, full of people, among whom were two who seemed to be
persons of diflintion, approached his ship, with signs of
peace and amity. They came on board without fear or dif-
trust, and addressed him in a most refpeaful manner, but in
a language altogether unknown to Aguilar. Cortes was in
the utmost perplexity and diltrefs, at an event of which he

1'59' great schemes which he meditated, if, in his tranfations with

the natives, he mult depend entirely upon such an imperfect,
ambiguous, and conjecural mode of communication, as the
use of signs. But he did not remain long in this cmbarraffing
situation: a fortunate accident extricated him, when his own
sagacity could have contributed little towards his relief. One of
the female slaves, whom he had received from the cazique of
Tabasco, happened to be present at the first interview between
Cortes and his new guests. She perceived his distress, as well
as the confusion of Aguilar; and as she perfectly underflood
the Mexican language, she explained what they said in the
Yucatan tongue, with which Aguilar was acquainted. This
woman, known afterwards by the name of Donna Marina, and
who makes a conspicuous figure in the history of the New
World, where great revolutions were brought about by finall
causes and inconsiderable inflruments, was born in one of the
provinces of the Mexican empire. Having been carried off a
captive by some hostile party, after a variety of adventures he
fell into the hands of the Tabafcans, and had rcfided long
enough among them to acquire their language, without losing
the use of her own. Though it was both tedious and trouble-
some to convcrfe by the intervention of two different interpret-
ers, Cortes was so highly pleated with having discovered this
method of carrying on ome intercourse with the people of a
country into which he was determined to penetrate, that in
the transports of his joy he confidered it as a visible intirpofition
of Providence in his favour

mander of his forces there, and that they were sent to inquire
what his intentions were in visiting their coast, and to offer him
what affiflance he might need, in order to continue his voyage.
Cortes, fruck with the appearance of thole people, as well as
the tenor of the message, assured them, in refpeCful terms,
that he approached their country with most friendly senti-
ments, and came to propose matters of great importance to the
welfare of their prince and his kingdom, which he would unfold
more fully, in person, to the governor and the general. Next
morning, without waiting for any answer, lie landed his
troops, his horses and artillery; and having chofcn proper
ground, began to ere huts for his men, and to fortify his
camp. The natives, instead of opposing the entrance of tlofe
fatal guests into their country, assisted them in all their opera-
tions, with an alacrity of which they had ere long good reason
to repent.

L- - the presence of their master. The Mexican officers could not

conceal their uneasiness at a request, which they knew to be
disagreeable, and which they foresaw might prove extremely
embarraling to their sovereign, whose mind had been filled
with many disquieting apprehensions, ever since the former
appearance of the Spaniards on his coafis. But before they
attempted to dissuade Cortes from insisting on this demand,
they endeavoured to conciliate his good-will, by entreating
him to accept of certain presents, which, as humble slaves of
MAontezuma, they laid at his feet. These were introduced with
great parade, and confilted of fine cotton cloth, of plumes of
various colours, and of ornaments of gold and silver, to a con-
fiderable value; the workmanship of which appeared to be as
curious as the materials were rich. The display of there pro-
duced an effed very different from what the Mexicans intended.
Instead of satisfying, it increased the avidity of the Spaniards,
and rendered them so eager and impatient to become mailers of
a countiy which abounded with such precious productions, that
Cortes could hardly liften with patience to the arguments
which Pilpatoe and Teutile employed to dissuade him from vi-
fiting the capital, and in a haughty determined tone he infifed
on his demand, of being admitted to a personal audience of their
Sovereign. During this interview, some painters, in the train
of the Mexican chiefs, had been diligently employed in deli-
neating upon white cotton cloths, figures of the ihips, the horses,
the artillery, the foiliers, and whatever else attracted their
eyes, as singular. When Cortes observed this, and was in-
formed that there pi&ures were to be ent to Montezuma, in
order to convey to him a more lively idea of the firange and
wonderful objcts now presented to their view, than any words

could communicate, he resolved to render the representation B 0 0 K

still more animated and interesting, by exhibiting such a spec- .--.-- '
tacle as might give both them and their monarch an awful im- 1 19'
pression of the extraordinary prowess of his followers, and the
irrefitible force of their arms. The trumpets, by his order,
founded an alarm; the troops, in a moment, formed in order
of battle, the infantry performed such martial exercises as were
bell suited to display the effect of their different weapons; the
horse, in various evolutions, gave a specimen of their agility
and strength; the artillery pointed towards the thick woods
which surrounded the camp, made dreadful havoc among the
trees. The Mexicans looked on with that silent amazement,
which is natural when the mind is firuck with objets, which
are both awful and above its comprehension. But, at the ex-
plosion of the cannon, many of them fled, some fell to the
ground, and all were so much confounded at the fight of men
whose power so neally refcmbled that of the Gods, that Cortes
found it difficult to compote and re-assure them. The painters
had now many new fubjeds on which to exercise their art, and
they put their fancy on the fretch in order to invent figures
and characters to represent the extraordinary things which they
had seen.

MESSENGERS were immediately dispatched to Montczuma N:o, i

with those piures, and a full account of every thing that hald 'il}' ," ,,t:'
passed since the arrival of the Spaniards, and by them Cortes
sent a present of some European curiosities to Montezuma,
which, though of no great value, he believed would be accept-
able on account of their novelty. The Mexican monarchs, in
order to obtain early information of every occurrence in all tlh
corners of their vail cmpire, had introduced a refincment in

1 l ' these were trained to agility by a regular education, and relieved

one another at moderate diflanccs, they conveyed intelligence
with surprising rapidity. Though the capital in which Mon-
tezuma resided was above a hundred and eighty miles from St.
Juan de Ulua, Cortes's presents were carried thither, and an
answer to his demands was received in a few days. The flme
officers who had hitherto treated with the Spaniards, were em-
ployed to deliver this answer; but as they knew how repug-
nant the determination of their mafler was to all the schemes
and wishes of the Spanish commander, they would not venture
to make it known until they had previously endeavoured to

negociation by introducing a train of a hundred Indians, loaded
with presents ent to him by Montezuma. The magnificence
of these was such as became a great monarch, and far exceeded
any idea which the Spaniards had hitherto formed of his wealth.
They were placed upon mats spread on the ground, in such
order, as howed them to the greatest advantage. Cortes
and his officers viewed, with admiration, the various manufac-
tures of the country, cotton fluffs so fine, and of such delicate
.texture as to resemble silk; pitures of animals, trees, and
other natural objects formed with feathers of different colours,
disposed and mingled with such skill and elegance, as to rival
the works of the pencil in truth and beauty of imitation.
But what chiefly attrated their eyes, were two large plates of

other of silver, an emblem of the moon ". These were accom-

Cortes received all these with an appearance of profound vene-
ration for the monarch by whom they were bestowed. But

his firit demand, as he could not without dishonour return to

Mexicans, astonished at feeing any man dare to oppose that

9 a haughty prince in pofleffion of extensive power. The Mex-

ican empire at this period, was at a pitch of grandeur to wlhich
no society ever attained in so hort a period. Though it had
fubfifled only a hundred and thirty years, its dominion extend-
ed from the North to the South Sea, over territories firetching
above five hundred leagues from east to weft, and more than
two hundred from north to south, comprehending provinces
not inferior in fertility, population, and opulence to any in
the torrid zone. The people were warlike and enterprising.
The authority of the monarch unbounded, and his revenues
considerable. If, with the forces which might have been fud-
denly affemblbd in such an empire, Montezuma had fallen upon
the Spaniards while encamped on a barren unhealthy coast,
unsupported by any ally, without a place of retreat, and defti-
tute of provisions, it is impossible, even with all the advantages
of their superior discipline and arms, that they could have isood
the shock, and they muli either have perished in such an une-
qual contest, or have abandoned the enterprise.
c'l:r.lel of As the power of Montezuma enabled him to take this fpiritecl

part, his own dispositions seemed naturally to prompt him to it.
Of all the princes who had swayed the Mexican sceptre, he was
the most haughty, the most violent, and the most impatient of con-
troul. Hlis fubjeds looked up to him with awe, and his enemies
with terror. The former he governed with unexampled rigour;
but they were impressed with such an opinion of his capacity,
as commanded their refpcLC; and by many victories over the
latter, he had fprcad far the dread of his arms, and had added
lbveral confidcrable provinces to his dominions. But though

his talents might be suited to the tranfations of a state o i- B 0 0 K
perfedcly polished as the Mexican empire, and fufficicnt to con- ---
dud them while in their accustomed course, they were altoge- ''19'
ther inadequate to a conjunture o extraordinary, and did not
qualify him either to judge with the discernment, or to ad
with the decision, requisite in such a trying emergence.

FROM the moment that the Spaniards appeared on his coast, ilis pFrplec-

iiy and terror

he discovered symptoms of timidity and einbarrafliment. In- upon the r-
flead of taking fich resolutions as the consciousness of his own s1raliaf'i
power, or the memory of his former exploits, might have in-
spired, he deliberated with an anxiety and lefitation which
did not escape the notice of his mcaneft courtiers. The per-
plexity and discomposure of Montezuma's mind upon this oc-
cafion, as well as the general difinay of his fubjeas, was not
owing wholly to the imprefflon which the Spaniards had made
by the novelty of their appearance and the terror of their arms.
Its origin may be traced up to a more remote source. There
was an opinion, if we may believe the carlieft and most authen-
tic Spanish historians, almost universal among the Americans,
that tome dreadful calamity was impending over their heads;
from a race of formidable invaders who should come from re-
gions towards the rising fun, to overrun and desolate their
country. Whether this disquieting apprehension flowed from
the memory of some natural calamity which had affliaed that
part of the globe, and impresscd the minds of the inhabitants
with fuperflitious fears and forebodings, or whether it was an
imagination accidentally suggested by the aftoniflmcnt which
the first fight of a new race of men occasioned, it is impofible
to determine. But as the Mexicans were more prone to lupcr-
flition than any people in tlie New World, they were more

all his subjects .

Continues to NOTWITHSTANDING the influence of this impreflion, when
negociac. the messenger arrived from the Spanish camp with an account

that Cortes, adhering to his original demand, refused to obey
the order enjoining him to leave the country, Montezuma
assumed some degree of resolution, and in a transport of rage
natural to a fierce prince, unaccuflomed to meet with any oppo-
fition to his will, he threatened to sacrifice those presumptuous
firangers to his gods. But his doubts and fears quickly re-
turned, and instead of issuing orders to carry his threats into
execution, he again called his ministers to confer and offer
their advice. Feeble and temporizing measures will always be
the result when men assemble to deliberate in a situation where
they ought to a. The Mexican council took no effectual
measure for expelling such troublesome intruders, and were fa-
tisfied with issuing a more positive injundion, requiring them
to leave the country; but this they preposterously accompanied
with a present of such value, as proved a fresh inducement to
remain there.

favoured the execution of the schemes which lie had formed.

which he had conferred, he saw the necessity of dissolving a
connetion which would obftrut and embarrass all his opera-
tions, and watched for a proper opportunity of coming to a
final rupture with him. Having this in view, he had laboured
by every art, to secure the efteein and affecion of his soldiers.
With his abilities for command, it was easy to gain their
esteem; and his followers were quickly satisfied that they might
rely, with perfet confidence, on the conduat and courage of
their leader. Nor was it more difficult to acquire their assec-
tion. Among adventurers, nearly of the fame rank, and ferv-
ing at their own expence, the dignity of command did not
elevate a general above mingling with those who aed un-
der him. Cortes availed himself of this freedom of intcr-
course, to insinuate himself into their favour, and by his affable

order of that monarch to depart inflantly out of his dominions;
and when Cortes, inltead of complying, renewed his requefi of
an audience, the Mexican turned from him abruptly, and quit-
ted the camp with looks and geflures which firongly expressed
his surprise and resentment. Next morning, none of the na-
tives, who used to frequent the camp in great numbers, in or-
der to barter with the soldiers, and bring in provisions, ap
peared. All friendly correspondence seemed now to be at an
end, and it was expeted every moment that hofilities would
commence. This, though an event that might have been fore-
seen, occasioned a sudden conflernation among the Spaniards,
which emboldened the adherents of Velasquez not only to mur-
mur and cabal against their general, but to appoint one of their
number to rcmonflrate openly againit his imprudence in at-
tempting the conquest of a mighty empire with such inadequate
force, and to urge the ncceftty of returning to Cuba, in order
to refit the fleet and augment the army. Dicgo de Ordaz, one

*diers, and foresaw how they would receive a proposition fatal I519
at once to all the splendid hopes and schemes which they had
been forming with such complacency, he carried his diffimula-
tion so far as to seem to relinquish his own measures in com-
pliance with the request of Ordaz, and issued orders that the
army should be in readiness next day to reimbark for Cu-
ba. As oon as this was known, the disappointed adventurers
exclaimed and threatened; the emissaries of Cortes, mingling
with them, inflamed their rage; the ferment became general;
the whole camp was almost in open mutiny; all demanding
with eagerness to fee their commander. Cortes was not flow
in appearing; when, with one voice, they expressed their aflo-
nifhment and indignation at the orders which they had re-
ceived. It was unworthy, they cried, of the Castilian courage
to be daunted at the first asped of danger, and infamous to fly
before any enemy appeared. For their parts, they were deter-
mined not to relinquish an enterprise, that had hitherto been
fucccfsful, and which tended so vilibly to spread the knowledge
of true religion, and to advance the glory and interest of their
country. Happy under his command, they would follow him
with alacrity through every danger, in quell of those fettle-
ments and treaflres which lie had so long held out to their
v;ew; hit if he clioli' rather to return to Cuba, and tamely
give up all his hopes of diflindion and opulence to an envious

that his orders to prepare for embarking were issued from a per-

rence to what he had been informed was their inclination, he
had sacrificed his own private opinion, which was firmly bent
on establishing immediately a settlement on the fca-coaft, and
then on endeavouring to penetrate into the interior part of the
country; that now he was convinced of his error; and as he
perceived that they were animated with the generous spirit
which breathed in every true Spaniard, he would resume, with
fresh ardour, his original plan of operation, and doubted not
to conduct them, in the career of vicory, to such independent
fortunes as their valour merited. Upon this declaration, shouts
of applause tetlified the excels of their joy. The measure seemed
to be taken with unanimous consent; such as secretly con-
demned it, being obliged to join in the acclamations, partly to
conceal their difaffetion from the general, and partly to avoid
the imputation of cowardice from their fellow-foldiers '.

give a beginning to a colony, he afembled the principal per-

magiflrates, in whom the government was to be veiled. As
men naturally transplant the inflitutions and forms of the
mother-country into their new settlements, this was framed
upon the model of a Spanish corporation. The magistrates
were diftinguifled by the fame names and ensigns of office,

ciples of avarice and enthusiasm, which prompted the Spaniards
to all their ntcrprifes in the New World, seem to have con-
curred in figgefling the name which Cortes beltowed on his
intended settlement. He called it, Villa rica de la vera Cruz;
that is, The rich town of the true Cross.

TiHE first meeting of the new council was diftinguifed by a ReGig; s 11

tranfadion of great moment. As soon as it assemblcd, Cortes con"m"liou
applied for leave to enter; and approaching with many marks
of' profound refpec, which added dignity to the tribunal, and
fct an example of reverence for its authority, he began a long
harangue, in which, with much art, and in terms extremely
flattering to erfons jft entering upon their new funcion, lie
observcd, that as the fupremejuriificion over the colony whlich
they had planted was now veiled in this court, lie confidered
them as clothed with the authority and representing the perfbn
of their fovcreign; that accordingly he would communicate to
them what lie deemed efrential to the public safety, with the
fame dutiful fidelity as if he were addrefing his royal mafler;
that the ecurity of a colony fittled in a great empire, whose
fovcreign had already discovered his hoflile intentions, depended
upon arms, and the efficacy of these upon the fulbordination
andi discipline prefcrved among the troops; that his right to
command was derived from a commiflion granted by tlle go-
veCrnor of Cuba; and as that had been long lince revoked, the
lawfulness of his jurisdiCtion might well be queflioncd ; that he

all his authority to them, that they, having both right to chufe,
and power to confer full jurifdidion, might appoint one, in.
the king's name, to command the army in its future opera-
tions; and as for his own part, such was his zeal for the service
in which they were engaged, that he would most cheerfully
take up a pike with the fame hand that laid down the general's
truncheon, and convince his fellow-foldiers, that though ac-
customed to command, he had not forgotten how to obey.
Having finished his discourse, he laid the commission from Ve-
lafquez upon the table, and, after kissing his truncheon, de-
livered it to the chief magiitrate, and withdrew.

and is chocn THE deliberations of the council were not long, as Cortes
and cpjitain had concerted this important measure with his confidents, and
general. had prepared the other members, with great address, for the

part which he wiihed them to take. His resignation was ac-
cepted; and as the uninterrupted tenour of their prosperity
under his conduct afforded the most satisfying evidence of his
abilities for command,. they, by their unanimous suffrage,
eleded him chief justice of the colony, and captain-general of
its army, and appointed his commiflion to be made out in the
king's name, with most ample powers, which were to continue
in force until the royal pleasure should be farther known.
That this deed might not be deemed the machination of a
junto, the council called together the troops, and acquainted
them with what had been resolv.ed. The soldiers, with eager

nor of Cuba, accepted of the commiflion, which vested in him
supreme jurifdicion, civil as well as military, over the colony,
with many professions of respect to the council, and gratitude
to the army. Together with his new command, he affilmed
greater dignity, and began to exercise more extensive powers.
Formerly he had felt himself to be only the deputy of a fubje&;
now he aed as the representative of his sovereign. The ad-
herents of Velasquez, fully aware of what would be the effect
of this change in his situation, could no longer continue silent
and passive fpedators of his ations. They exclaimed openly
against the proceedings of the council as illegal, and againit
those of the army as mutinous. Cortes, instantly perceiving
the necessity of giving a timely check to such seditious discourse
by some vigorous measure, arrested Ordaz, Efcudero, and Ve-
lafquez de Leon, the ringleaders of this fation, and ent them
prisoners aboard the fleet, loaded with chains. Their depend-
ants, astonished and overawed, remained quiet; and Cortes,
more desirous to reclaim than to punifli his prisoners, who
were officers of great merit, courted their friendship with such
afliduity and addreis, that the reconciliation was perfectly cor-
dial; and on the moil trying occasions, neither their con-

indignity with which they had been treated, tempted them to

by the Zcm-

had hitherto remained, and advance into the country. To
this he was encouraged by an event no less fortunate than sea-
fonable. Some Indians having approached his camp in a myfie-
rious manner, were introduced into his presence. He found
that they were sent with a proffer of fiiendfhip from the ca-
ziqlle of Zempoalla, a considerable town at no great diflance;
and from their answers to a variety of (qcftions which he put
to them, according to his usual pradtice in every interview with
the people of the country, he gathered, that their maiter,
though subject to the Mexican empire, was impatient of the
yoke, and filled with such dread and hatred of Montezuma,
that nothing could be more acceptable to him than any profped
of deliverance from the opprcflion under which he groaned.
On hearing tils, a ray of light and hope broke in upon the
mind of Cortes. He aw tlit the great empire which he in-
tended to attack was not united, nor its sovereign beloved. iHe
concluded, that the caufcs of diitafl'clion could not be confined
to one province, but that in other corners there must be mal-
contents, so weary of fubjedion, or so desirous of change, as
to be ready to follow the flandard of any protecor. Full of

to the Zempoallans, and promised soon to visit their cazique". ' '9

IN order to perform this promise, it was not necesSary to vary M.arrhcs to

the route which he had alrcady fixed for his march. Some of- Z "i" 11
ficers, whom he had employed to furvcy the coaf, having dif-
covered a village named Qiabiilan, about forty miles to the
northward, which, both on account of the fertility of the ioil,
and commodiousness of the harbour, seemed to be a more pro-
per fation for a settlement than that where he was encamped,
Cortes determined to remove thither. Zempoalla lay in his
way, where the cazique received him in the manner which he
had reason to expect; with gifts and caresses, like a man soli-
citous to gain his good-will; with rcfpcCL approaching almost
to adoration, like one who looked up to him as a deliverer.
From him he learned many particulars with refpea to the cha-
rader of Montezuma, and the circumstances which rendered
his dominion odious. H-I was a tyrant, as the cazique told him
with tears, haughty, cruel, and suspicious; wlo treated his
own fubjeds with arrogance, ruined the conquered provinces
by exceflive exadions, and often tore their sons and daughters
from them by violence; the former, to be offercd as victims to
his gods ; the latter, to be reservcd as concubines for hinifelf or
favourites. Cortes, in reply to him, artfully insinuatcd, that
one great objec of the Spaniards in visiting a country ol remote
from their own, was to rcdr-el grievances, and to relieve the
opprefed ; and having encouraged him to hope for this inter-
position in due time, he continued his march to Quiabillan.

with such an high opinion of the Spaniards, as beings of a fu-
perior order, and irresistible in arms, that, relying on their
protecion, they ventured to insult the Mexican power, at the
very name of which they were accustomed to tremble. Some
of Montezuma's officers having appeared to levy the usual tri-
bute, and to demand a certain number of human vicims, as an
expiation for their guilt in presuming to hold intercourse with
those frangcrs whom the emperor had commanded to leave his
dominions, instead of obeying the order, they made them pri-

threatened to sacrifice them to their gods. From this last dan- 1j'9'
ger they were delivered by the interposition of Cortes, who
manifested the utmost horror at the mention of such a deed.
The two caziques having now been pushed to an aa of such
open rebellion, as left them no hope of safety but in attaching
themselves inviolably to the Spaniards, they oon completed
their union with them, by formally acknowledging themselves
to be vassals of the fame monarch. Their example was fol-
lowed by the Totonaques, a fierce people who inhabited the
mountainous part of the country. They willingly fubjeted '-
themselves to the crown of Castile, and offered to accompany

of his colony to addrcfs a letter to the king, containing a long
account of their own services; a pompous description of the
country which they had discovercd; its riches, the number of
its inhabitants, their civilization and arts; a view of the pro-
grefs which they had already made, in annexing several exten-
five provinces of it to the crown of Cafile, and of the schemes
which they had formed, as well as the hopes which they enter-
tained, of reducing the whole to ful)jeEtion; and last of all, they
gave a minute detail of the motives which had induced them
to renounce all connetion with Vclafquez, to fettle a colony
dependant upon the crown alone, and to veil the supreme
power, civil as wel as military, in the hands of Cortes; hum-
bly rcqucfling their sovereign to ratify what they had done by
his royal authority. Cortes himself wrote in a similar firain;
and as he knew that the Spanish court, accustomed to the ex-

verer, would give little credit to their fplcndid accounts of New
Spain, if they were not accompanied with such a specimen of
what it contained, as would excite an higli idea of its opulence,
he solicited his soldiers to relinquinf what they might-claim

expe&ed event occasioned a general alarm. Some soldiers and :"0'
tailors, secretly attached to Velasquez, or intimidated at the
profped of the dangers unavoidable in attempting to penetrate
into the heart of a great empire with fich unequal force, formed
the design of seizing one of the brigantines, and making their
escape to Cuba, in order to give the governor such intelligence
as might enable him to intercept the hip which was to carry
the treasure and dispatches to Spain. This conspiracy, though
formed by persons of low rank, was conducted with profound
secrecy; but at .the moment when every thing was ready for
execution, they were betrayed by one of their afbociates.

perceived that the spirit of difaffedCion still lurked among

success of his schemes, or kept down by the hand of au-
thority, various events might occur which would encourage
and call it forth. He observed, that many of his men, weary
of the fatigue of service, longed to revisit their settlements
in Cuba; and that upon any appearance of extraordinary
danger, or any reverse of fortune, it would be impoifible
to refrain them from returning thither. He was fcnfible

with much solicitude, upon those particulars, he saw no hope
of success, but in cutting off all possibility of retreat, and re-
ducing his men to the necessity of adopting the fame resolution
with which he himself was animated, either to conquer or to
perish. With this view, he determined to destroy his fleet;
but as he durst not venture to execute such a bold resolution by
his ingle authority, he laboured to bring his soldiers to adopt
his ideas with refped to the propriety of this measure. His
address in accomplishing this was not inferior to the arduous
occasion in which it was employed. He persuaded ome, that
the hips had suffered so much by having been long at sea, as
to be altogether unfit for service; to others he pointed out
what a seasonable reinforcement of strength they would derive
from the juncion of an hundred men, now unprofitably em-
ployed as sailors; and to all he represented the ne'cessity of
fixing. their eyes and wishes upon what was before them, with-
out allowing the idea of a retreat once to enter their thoughts.
With universal content the ships were drawn. ashore,. and after
stripping them of their fails, rigging, iron-works, ..and what-
ever else might be of use, they were broke in. pieces. Thus,
from an effort of magnanimity, to which there is nothing pa-
rallel in history, five hundred men voluntarily consented to be
ihut up in a hostile country, filled with powerful and unknown
nations; and having precluded every means of escape, left
thenfelves without any resource but their own valour and per-
f'cverance b.

and the disposition of his allies were equally favourable. All ---
the advantages, however, derived from the latter, though pro- '5''
cured by much assiduity and address, were well-nigh loft in a
moment by an indiscreet ally of religious zeal, which, on
many occasions, precipitated Cortcs into aions inconsistent
with the prudence that diftinguiihes his character. Thougl
hitherto he had neither time nor opportunity to explain to the
natives the errors of their own fuperfition, or to inftrua them
in the principles of the Christian faith, he commanded his fol-
diers to overturn the altars and to destroy the idols in the chief
temple of Zempoalla, and in their place to erec a crucifix and
an image of the Virgin Mary. The people beheld this with
astonishment and horror; the priefis excited them to arms;
but such was the authority of Cortes, and so great the ascendant
which the Spaniards had acquired, that the commotion was ap-
peased without bloodshed, and concord perfetly re-established .

CORTES began his march from Zempoalla on the sixteenth Advances in.

of August, with five hundred men, fifteen horse, and fix field- try.he coun
pieces. The reft of his troops, consisting chiefly of such as
from age or infirmity were less fit for active service, he left as
a garrison in Villa Rica, under the command of Efcalante, an
officer of merit, and warmly attached to his iritereft. The
cazique of Zempoalla supplicd him with provisions, and with
two hundred of those Indians called Tamemes, whose office, in
a country where tame animals were unknown, was to carry
burdens, and perform all fervilc labour. They were a great
relief to the Spanifl foldicrs, who hitherto had been obliged,

'5'9 of his troops, but Cortes was satisfied with four hundred; tak-

ing care, however, to chute persons of such note as might prove
hostages for the fidelity of their mafler. Nothing memorable
happened in his progress, until he arrived on the confines of
Tlafcala. The inhabitants of that province, a warlike people,
were implacable enemies of the Mexicans, and had been united
in an ancient alliance with the caziques of Zempoala. Though
less civilized than the fubjeas of Montezuma, they were ad-
vanced in improvement far beyond the rude nations of Ame-
rica, whose manners we have described. They had made con-
fiderable progress in agriculture; they dwelt in large towns;
they were not firangers to some species of commerce ; and in
the imperfea accounts of their inflitutions and laws, transmitted
to us by the early Spanish writers, we discern traces both of
diitributive jutlice and of criminal jurifdiQion, in their interior
police. But still, as the degree of their civilization was incom-
plete, and as they depended for subsistence not on agriculture
alone, but trusted for it, in a great measure, to hunting, they
retained many of the qualities natural to men in this state.
Like them, they were fierce and revengeful; like them, too,
they were high-fpirited and independant. In confeqience of
the former, they were involved in perpetual hostilities, and
had but a slender and occasional intercourse with neighbouring
flates. The latter inspired them with such detestation of fervi-
tude, that they not only refused to stoop to a foreign yoke, and
maintained an obitinate and successful contest in defence of their
liberty against the superior power of the Mexican empire, but
they guarded with equal solicitude against domeflic tyranny;

CORTES, though he had received informatioh concerning the llis wxnr with

martial characer of this people, flattered himself that his pro- tilaa-
fefions of delivering the oppressed from the tyranny.of Mon-
tezuma, their enmity to the Mexicans, and the example of
their ancient allies the Zempoallans, might induce them to
grant him a friendly reception. In order to dispose them to
this, four Zcmpoallans of great eminence were sent ambafna-
dors, to request, in his name and in that of their cazique, that
they would permit the Spaniards to pass through the territories
of Tlafcala in their way to Mexico. But inftcad of the favour-
able anfwvcr which was cxpcecd, the Tlafcalans seized the am-
bafladors, and, without any regard to their public charadcr,
made preparations for sacrificing them to their gods. At the
fame time, they aflfembled thcir troops, in order to oppose those
unknown invaders, if they hould attempt to make their passage
good by force of arms. Various motives concurred in precipi-
tating the Tlafcalans into this resolution. A fierce people, fliut
up within its own narrow precincs, and little acculomedl to any
intercourse with foreigners, is apt to confider every flrangcr as
an enemy, and is easily excited to arms. They concluded, from
Cortes's proposal of viliting Montezuma in his capital, that,
notwithilanding all his profcffioiis, he courted the fricndfliip of
a monarch whom they botlh hated and feared. The imprudent
zeal of Cortcs in violating the temples in Zcmpoalla, filled the
'Tlafcalans with horror; and as they were no lcs attached to
their fuipcriflition t tha ll other nations of New Spain, they
were impatient to avengc t;chir injured gols, and to aciquire the

merit

B V0 K merit of offering up to them as victims those impious men,

V.
--v.' who had dared to profane their altars; the Spaniards, from

'9'' the smallness of their number, were objects of their contempt;

they had not yet measured their own strength with theirs, and
had no idea of the superiority which they derived from their
arms and discipline.
Aug. 30. CORTES, after waiting ome days, in vain, for the return

of his ambassadors, advanced into the Tlafcalan territories. As
the resolutions of people who delight in war are executed with
no less promptitude than they are formed, he found troops in
the field ready to oppose him. They attacked him with great
intrepidity, and in the firfl encounter, wounded some of the
Spaniards, and killed two horses; a loss, in their situation, of
great moment, becauife it was irreparable. From this specimen
of the courage of his new enemies, Cortes saw the necessity of
proceeding with caution. His army marched in close order;
he chore the stations, where he halted with attention, and for-
tified every camp with extraordinary care. During fourteen
days he was exposed to almost uninterrupted assaults, the Tlaf-
calans advancing with numerous armies, and renewing the at-
tack in various forms, with a degree of valour and perseverance
to which the Spaniards had seen nothing parallel in the New
World. The Spanish historians describe those successive battles
with great pomp, and enter into a minute detail of particulars,
mingling many exaggerated and incredible circumflances with
those which are real and marvellous. But no power of words
can render the recital of a combat interesting, where there is no
equality of danger; and when the narrative closes with an ac-

son falls on the other, the most laboured descriptions of the ----
previous disposition of the troops, or of the various vicissitudes 1I9'
in the engagement, command no attention.

TH ERE are some circumstances, however, in this war, which Some singular

circum~lance s

are memorable and merit notice, as they throw light upon the ;, it.
characer both of the people of New Spain, and of their con-
querors. Though the Tlafcalans brc-ight into the field such vast
armies as appear sufficient to have overwhelmed the Spaniards,
they were never able to make any impression upon their small
battalion. Singular as this may seem, it is not inexplicable.
The Tlafcalans, though addited to war, were, like all unpo-
liflied nations, strangers to military order and discipline, and
loft all the advantage which they might have derived from their
numbers, and the impetuosity of their attack, by their conflant
solicitude to carry off the dead and wounded. This point of
honour, founded on a sentiment of tenderness natural to the
human mind, and strengthened by anxiety to preserve the bo-
dies of their countrymen from being devoured by their enemies,
was universal among the people of New Spain. Attention to
this pious office occupied them, even during the heat of com-
bat e, broke their union, and diminiihed the force of the im-
pression which they might have made by a joint effort.

NOT only was their superiority in number of little avail, but

the imperfecion of their military weapons rendered their va-
lour in a great measure inoffensive. After three battles, and
many skirmishes and assaults, not one Spaniard was killed in.

B 0o Ki the field. Arrows and fpcars, headed with flint or the bones
L-,, of fiflles, flakes hardened in the fire, and wooden swords,

i1 9 though defr-uive weapons among naked Indians, were easily

turned aside by the Spanish bucklers, and could hardly pene-
trate the enapiles, or quilted jackets which the soldiers wore.
The Tlafcalans advanced boldly to the charge, and often fought
hand to hand. Many of the Spaniards were wounded, though
all slightly, which cannot be imputed to any want of courage
in their enemies, but to the defe&c of the arms with which they
assailed them.

NOTWITHSTANDING the fury with which the Tlafcalans at-

tacked the Spaniards, they eem to have conducted their
hostilities with some degree of barbarous generosity. They
gave the Spaniards Warning of their hostile intentions, and as
they knew that they wanted provisions, and imagined, per-
haps, like the other Americans, that they had left their own
country because it did not afford them fubfilfence, they ent to
their camp a large supply of poultry and maize, desiring them
to eat plentifully, because they scorned to attack an enemy en-
feebled by hunger, and it would be an affront to their Gods to
offer them famished vidims, as well as difagreable to them-
selves to feed on such emaciated prey '.

WHEN they were taught by the first encounter with their

new enemies, that it was not easy to execute this threat; when
they prceived, in the subsequent engagements, that notwith-
standing all the efforts of their own valour, of which they had
a very high opinion, not one of the Spaniards was slain or

taken, they began to conceive them to be a superior order of B O0 K
beings, against whom human power could not avail. In this _..-,,
extremity, they had recourse to their priests, requiring them 1519.
to reveal the mysterious causes of such extraordinary events,
and to declare what new means they hould employ in order to
repulse those formidable invaders. The priests, after many fa-
crifices and incantations, delivered this response. That these
firangers were the offspring of the fun, procreated by his ani-
mating energy i the regions of the east; that, by day, while
cherished with the influence of his parental beams, they were
invincible; but by night, when his reviving heat was with-
drawn, their vigour declined and faded like the herbs in the
field, and they dwindled down into mortal meng. Theories
less plausible have gained credit with more enlightened nations,
and have influenced their conduct. In consequence of this, the
Tlafcalans, with the implicit confidence of men who fancy
themselves to be under the guidance of Heaven, acted in con-
tradidion to one of their most established maxims in war, and
ventured to attack the enemy in the night-time, in hopes of
destroying them when enfeebled and surprised. But Cortes
had more vigilance and discernment than to be deceived by the
rude stratagems of an Indian army. The centinels at his out-
posts, observing some extraordinary movement among the Tlaf-
calans, gave the alarm. In a moment the troops were under
arms, and sallying out, disperscd the party with great flaugh-
ter, without allowing them to approach the camp. Convinced,
by fad experience, that their priests had deluded them, and
satisfied that they attempted in vain, either to deceive or to
vanquish their enemies, the fierceness of the Tlafcalans abated,
and they began to incline seriously to peace.

seemed to favour each opinion. On the one hand, as the
Spaniards confiantly difmifled the prisoners whom they took,
not only without injury, but often with presents of Euro-
pean toys, and renewed their offers of peace after every vic-
tory; this lenity amazed people accultomed to the exterminat-
ing fyflem of war known in America, and who sacrificed and
devoured without mercy all the captives taken in battle, and
disposed them to entertain favourable ifntiments of their huma-
nity. But, on the other hand, as Cortes had seized fifty of
their countrymen who brought provisions to his camp, and
fippofing them to be spies, had cut off their hands h; this
bloody fpetacle, added to the terror occasioned by the fire-
arms and horfcs, filled them with dreadful impressions of their
ferocity '. Accordingly, this uncertainty was apparent in their
mode of addressing the Spaniards. " If, said they, you are
divinities of a cruel and savage nature, we present to you five
slaves, that you may drink their blood and eat their flesh. If
you are mild deities, accept an offering of incense and varie-
gated plumes. If you are men, here is meat, and bread and
fruit to nourish you "'. The peace which both parties now de-
Ccnaludet. fired with ecual ardour, was oon concluded. The Tlafcalans

yielded thcmfelves as vassals to the crown of Castile, and en-
gaged to assist Cortes in all his future operations. He took the
republic under his proteefion, and pron.ifed to defend their
persons and poffcfIions from injury or violence.

THIS treaty was concluded at a seasonable juncure for the B 0v K

Spaniards. The fatigue of service among a small body of men, '-,--
surrounded by such a multitude of enemies, was incredible. Advan'tageB
Half the army was on duty every night, and even they whose orit to the
turn it was to refl, slept always upon their arms, that they
might be ready to run to their polls on a moment's warning.
Many of them were wounded, a good number, and among
there Cortes liimfelf, laboured under the distemper peculiar
to the climate, and several had died ince they set out
from Vera Cruz. Notwithstanding the supplics which
they received from the Tlafcalans, they were often in
want of provisions, and so destitute of the necessaries most
requisite in dangerous service; that they had no salve to dress
their wounds, but what was composed with the fat of the In-
dians whom they had slain'. Worn out with such intolerable
toil and hardships, many of the soldiers began to murmur,
and when they reflected on the multitude and boldness of their
enemies, more were ready to despair. It required the utmost
exertion of Cortes's authority and address to check this spirit of
despondency in its progress, and to reanimate his followers with
their wonted sense of their own superiority over the enemies
with whom they had to contend m. The fubmiflion of the Tlaf-
calans, and their own triumphant entry into the capital city,
where they were received with the reverence paid to beings of
a fiperior order, banished, at once, from the minds of the
Spaniards all memory of palt sufferings, dispelled every anxi-
ous thought with refpe to their future operations, and fully
satisfied them that there was not now any power in America
able to withtfand their arms ".

tous to gain
their confi ries of great moment with refpea to his future schemes. In

formation concerning every particular relative to the state of the
Mexican empire, or to the qualities of its sovereign, which
could be of use in regulating his conduct, whether he should
be obliged to a as a friend or as an enemy. As he found
that the antipathy of his new allies to the Mexican nation was
no less implacable than had been represented, and perceived
what benefit he might derive from the aid of such powerful
confederates, he employed all his powers of insinuation in order
to gain their confidence. Nor was any extraordinary exertion
of there necessary. The Tlafcalans, with the levity of mind
natural to unpolifhed men, were, of their own accord, disposed
to run from the extreme of hatred to that of fondness. Every
thing in the appearance and conduct of their guests, was to them
matter of wonder . They gazed at whatever the Spaniards did
with admiration, and fancying them to be of heavenly origin,
were eager not only to comply with their demands, but to an-
ticipate their wishes. They offered, accordingly, to accom-
pany Cortes in his march to Mexico, with all the forces of the.
republic, under the command of their most experienced cap.

age. They all confidered themselves as initruments employed

were qualified either by their knowledge or morals for such a
function, they were more eager to discharge it. The profound
veneration of the Tlafcalans for the Spaniards, having encou-
raged Cortes to explain to obme of their chiefs the dodtrines of
the Christian religion, and to insist that they flould abandon
their own superstitions, and embrace the faith of their new
friends, they, according to an idea universal among barbarous
nations, readily acknowledged the truth and excellence of what
he taught; but contended, that the Tenles of Tlafcala were di-
vinities no less than the God in whom the Spaniards believed;.
and as that Being was intitled to their homage, so they were
bound to revere the fame powers which their ancestors had
worshipped. Cortes continued, nevertheless, to urge his de-
mand in a tone of authority, mingling threats with his argu-
ments, until the Tlafcalans could bear it no longer, and con-
jured him never to mention this again, left the Gods should
avenge on their heads the guilt of having listened to such a
proposition. Cortes, astonished and enraged at their obllinacy,
prepared to execute by force what he could not accomplifl by
persuasion, and was going to overturn their altars, and cast
down their idols with the fame violent hand as at Zempoalla,
if father Bartholemew de Olmedo, chaplain to the expedition,
had not checked his inconsiderate impetuosity. He represented
the imprudence of such an attempt in a large city newly re-
conciled, and filled with people no les fiiperflitious than war-
like; he declared that the proceeding at Zempoalla had always
appeared to him precipitate and unjul; that religion was not

time, when the rights of conscience were little understood in
the Christian world, and the idea of toleration unknown, one
is aflonifhed to find a Spaniih monk of the sixteenth century
among the first advocates against persecution, and in behalf of
religious liberty. The remonfirances of an ecclefiaflic no less
refpedable for wisdom than virtue, had their proper weight
with Cortes. HI-e left the Tlafcalans in the undisturbed exer-
cife of their own rites, requiring only that they ihould desist
from their horrid practice of offering human victims in fa-
crifice.
Adharces to CORTES, as soon as his troops were fit for service, resolved

to continue his march towards Mexico, notwithstanding the
earnest dissuasives of the Tlafcalans, who represented his de-
llrution as unavoidable, if he put himself in the power of a
prince so faithless and cruel as Montezuma. As he was ac-
companied by fix thousand Tlafcalans, lie had now the com-
Oc-. 3 mand of forces which resembled a regular army. They di-

reded their course towards Cholula; Montezuma, who had at
length conlented to admit the Spaniards into his presence, hav-
ing informed Cortes, that he had given orders for his friendly
reception thcrc. Cholula was a conlidcrable town, and though

pendent state, but had been lately fubjeded to the Mexican B O 0 I
empire. This was confidered by all the people of New.Spain ----
as a holy place, the anluary and chief fear of their gods, to 5'9'
which pilgrims resorted from every province, and a greater
number of human vi&ims were offered in its principal temple
than even in that of Mexico . Montezuma eeins to have in-
vited the Spaniards thither, either fronm ome ;'uperltitious hope
that the gods would not surfer this ihcred mansion to be defiled,
without pouring down their wrath upon those impious firangers,
who ventured to insult their power in the place of its peculiar
reiidence, or from a belief that he himself might there attempt
to cut them off with more certain iucccls, under the immediate
protedion of his divinities.

CORTES had been warned by the TlaCcalans, before he set The everity

out on his march, to keep a watchful eye over the Cholulans. d ureh tre.r
He himself, though received into the town with much eeming
refpecQ and cordiality, observed everal circumstances in their
conduct which excited ufpicion. Two of the Tl;iiclans, who
were encamped at some diflance from the town, as the Cho-
lulans refused to admit their ancient enemies within its prc-
cindts, having found means to enter in dilguife, acquainted
Cortes, that they observed the women and children of the prin-
cipal citizens retiring in great hurry every night; and that fix
children had been acrificecl in the chief temple, a rite which
indicated the execution of some warlike enterprise to be ap-
proaching. At the fame time, Marina te interpreter received

--- · the town; that some of the streets were barricaded, and in
'159' others, pits or deep trenches were dug, and slightly covered

over, as traps into which the horse might fall; that stones and
missive weapons were collected on the tops of the temples,
with which to overwhelm the infantry ; that the fatal hour was
now at hand, and their ruin unavoidable. Cortes, alarmed at
this concurring evidence, secretly arrested three of the chief
priests, and extorted from them a confeflion that confirmed the
intelligence which he had received. As not a moment was to
be loft, he instantly resolved to prevent his enemies, and to in-
flit on them such dreadful vengeance as might firike Monte-
zuma and his fubjeas with terror. For this purpose, the Spa-
niards and Zempoallans were drawn up in a large court, which
had been allotted for their quarters near the centre of the town;
the Tlafcalans had orders to advance; the magifirates, and fe-
veral of the chief citizens, were sent for under various pretexts,
and seized. On a signal given, the troops rushed out, and fell
upon the multitude, destitute of leaders, and so much afto-
nifhed, that the weapons dropped from their hands, and they
flood motionless, and incapable of defence. While the Spa-
niards pressed them in front, the Tlafcalans attacked them in
the rear. The fireets were filled with bloodshed and death.
The temples, which afforded a retreat to the priests and some
of the leading men, were set on fire, and they perished in the
flames. This scene of horror continued two days; during
which, the wretched inhabitants suffered all that the defirudive
rage of the Spaniards, or the implacable revenge of their Indian
allies, could inflit. At length the carnage ceased, after the
slaughter of fix thousand Cholulans, without the loss of a ingle
Spaniard. Cortes then released the magiilrates, and reproach-

ing
48

ing them bitterly for their intended treachery, declared, that n 0 0 I
as jufiice was now appeased, he forgave the offence, but re- ----
quired them to rccal the citizens who hd lied, and re-eftabllifh ' '
order in the town. Such was the ascendant which the Spa-
niards had acquired over this superstitious race of men, and
so deeply were they imprefcid with an opinion of their fupcrior
discernment, as well as power, that, in obedience to this com-
mand, the city was in a few days filled again with people, who,
amidst the ruins of their sacred buildings, yielded refipccful
service to men whose hands were slained with the blood of tlieir
relations and fellow-citizens .

which he pafied, he was received as a person poflfcfi'l of flii- co.
cient power to deliver the empire from the opprecfion under
which it groaned; and the caziqucs or governors, with the un-
reserved confidence reposed in superior beings, communicated
to him all the grievances which they felt under the tyrannical
government of Montezuma. When Cortes firfi obfcrved the
feeds of discontent in tle remote provinces of the empire, a ray
of hope broke in upon his mind ; but when lie discovered such
symptoms of alienation from their monarch near the leat of go-
vernment, he concluded that the vital parts of the conflitution
were affedcd, and conceived the most sanguine expecations of
overturning a slate whoSe natural frength was thus divided and
impaired. While those renedions encouraged the general to
persist in his arduous undertaking, the soldiers were no lets

HISTORY OF AMERICA.
B oO K descending from the mountains of Chalco, across which the

V. -.-v-' road lay, the vast plain of Mexico opened gradually to their
Firrt L.ev of view. When they first beheld this profped, one of the mo[t

firiking and beautiful on the face of the earth; when they ob-
served fertile and cultivated fields, stretching farther than the eye
could reach; when they aw a lake resembling the sea in extent,
encompassed with large towns, and discovered the capital city,
riling upon an iland in the middle, adorned with its temples.
and turrets; the scene so far exceeded their imagination, that
some believed the fanciful descriptions of romance were realized,
and that its enchanted palaces and gilded domes were presented.
to their fight; others could hardly persuade themselves that:
this wonderful pedacle was any thing more than a dream ..
As they advanced, their doubts were removed, but their amaze-
ment increased. They were now fully satisfied that the country
was rich beyond any conception which they had formed of it,
and flattered themselves, that at length they hould obtain an,
ample recompeace for all their services and sufferings.

The irrefola. No enemy had yet appeared. to oppose their progress, though;
lion of Mon.
zuma. several circumstances occurred which led them to fufped that

some design was formed to surprise and cut them. off. Many
messengers arrived successively from Montezuma, permitting
them one day to advance, requiring them on the next to retire,
as his hopes or fears alternately prevailed; and so wonderful
was this infatuation, which seems to be unaccountable on any

adorned with plumes, and clad in mantles of fine cotton. Each
of these, in his order, passed by Cortes, and saluted him ac-
cording to the mode deemed most refpeaful and fulmiffive in
their country. They announced the approach of Montezuma
himself, and oon after his harbingers came in fight. There
appeared first two hundred persons in an uniform dress, with
large plumes of feathers, alike in fashion, marching two and
two, in deep silence, barefooted, with their eyes fixed on the
ground. These were followed by a company of higher rank,
in their most showy apparel, in the midst of whom was Mon-
tezuma, in a chair or litter richly ornamented with gold, and
feathers of various colours. Four of his principal favourites
carried him on their shoulders, others supported a canopy of
curious workmanship over his head. Before him marched
three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which they
lifted up on high at certain intervals, and at that signal all
the people bowed their heads, and hid their faces, as unwor-
thy to look on so great a monarch. When he drew near,
Cortes dismounted, advancing towards him with officious hafle,
and in a rcfpedQful poflure. At the fame time Montczuma
alighted from his chair, and leaning on the arms of two of his
near relations, approached with a flow and flatcly pace, his
attendants covering the street with cotton.cloths, that he might

---.-. _, reverence, after the European fashion, He returned the fa-

lutation, according to the mode of his country, by touching
the earth with his hand, and then kifling it. This ceremony,
the customary exprefiion of reverence from inferiors towards
tliofe who wcre above them in rank, appeared such amazing
condefccnfion in a proud monarch, who scarcely deigned to
confidcr the reft of mankind as of the fame ipecies with himself,
that all his ilbjeds firmly belicved those )pcrfons, before whom
he humbled himself in this manner, to be something more than
human. Accordingly, as they marched through the crowd,
the Spaniards frequently, and with much fatisfadion, heard
thcmefelves denominated T7l'les, or divinities. Nothing mate-
rial pafidc in this firfi interview. Montezuma condudted Cortes.
to the quarters which he had prepared for his reception, and
immediately took leave of him, with a politeness not unworthy
of a court more refined. " You are now," fays he, " with
your brothers, in your own house; refrefli yourselves after.
your fatigue, and be happy until I return '." The place allot-
ted to the Spaniards for their lodging was a house built by the
father of Montezuma. It was surrounded by a flone-wall, with.
towers at proper distances, which served for defence as well as
for ornament, and its apartments and courts were so large as
to accommodate both the Spaniards and their Indian allies.
The firlt care of Cortes was to take precautions for his security,
by planting the artillery so as to command the different avenues
which lcd to it, by appointing a large division of his troops to
be always on guard, and by polling ccntinels at proper flations,
with injundlions to observe the fatme vigilant dilfiplinc as if they
v'crc within light of an enemy's camp.

suitable to the opulence of his kingdom. A long conference cn-
sued, in which Cortes learned what was the opinion of Monte-
zuma with refpeQ to the Spaniards. It was an eflablilicd tradi-
tion, he told him, among the Mexicans, that their anceflors came
originally from a remote region, and conquered the provinces nov
fubijed to his dominion; that after they were fettlcd there, the
great captain who condued this colony returned to his own
country, promising, that at some future period his defccnlants
Ihould visit them, assume the government, and reform their con-
flitution and laws; that, from what lie had hcard and fccn of
Cortcs and his followers, he was convinced that they were the
very persons whose appearance their traditions and prophecies
taught them to expecqt; that accordingly lie had received them,
not as firangers, but as relations of the fame blood and paren-
tage, and desired that they might confider thcmfelves as mafiers
in his dominions, for both himself and his fublljcs flould be
ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their
wishes. Cortes made a reply in his ufuial ftilc witl refpedr to
the dignity and power of his fovecrign, and his intention in
Iendling him into that country; artfully cideavouring lo to
frame his discourse, that it might coincide as much as poiile
with the idea which Montezuma had formed concerning the
origin of the Spaniards. Next morning, Cortes and some of
his principal attendants were admitted to a public audience of
the emperor. The three fubfequcnt ldays ere employed int

HISTORY OF AMERICA.
B 0 0 any place the Spaniards had beheld in America, and yet so little

resembling the ftrudure of an European city, filled them with
ES9- ifurprife and admiration.

MEXICO, Tenuchtitlan as it was anciently called by the

natives, is situated in a large plain, environed by mountains
of such height, that, though within the torrid zone, the tem-
·perature of its climate is mild and healthful. All the moisture
which descends from the high grounds is collected in several
lakes, the two largefi of which, of about ninety miles in cir-
cuit, communicate with each other. The waters of the one
are fresh, those of the others brackiih. On the banks of the
latter, and on rome fnall islands adjoining to them, the capital
of Montezuma's empire was built. The access to the city was
by artificial causeways or streets, formed of flones and earth,
about thirty feet in breadth. As the waters of the lake du-
ring the rainy season overflowed the flat country, these cause-
ways were of considerable length. That of Tacuba on the
weft extended a mile and a half; that of Tezeuco on the north-
weft three miles; that of Cuoyacan towards the south fix
miles. On the east there was no causeway, and the city could
be approached only by canoes ". In each of these causeways
were openings at proper intervals, through which the waters
flowed; and over these beams of timber were laid, which
being covered witl earth, the causeway or fireet had every-
where an uniform appearance. As the approaches to the city
were lingular, its conftlruiion was remarkable. Not only the
temples of their gods, but the houfcs belonging to the monarch,
and to pcrfons of diflindion, were of such dimensions, that,
in comparirfon with any other buildings which had been dif-
·covered in America, they might be termed magnificent. The

habitations

habitations of the common people were mean, resembling the B 0o K
huts of other Indians. But they were all placed in a regular ---
manner, on the banks of the canals which patsed through the S
city, in some of its diftrils, or on the fides of the fireets which
interfedted it in other quarters. In several places were large
openings or squares, one of which, allotted for the great
market, is said- to have been so spacious, that forty or fifty
thousand persons carried on traffic there. In this city, the
pride of the New World, and the noblest monument of the
industry and art of man, while unacquainted with the use of
iron, and destitute of aid from any domestic animal, the Spa-
niards, who are most moderate in their computations, reckon,
that there were at leaf sixty thousand inhabitants x.

BUT how much soever the novelty of those objecs might Their dan-

~erous iituaa

amuse or astonish the Spaniards, they felt the utmost solicitude ton.
with refpea to their own situation. From a concurrence of
circumstances, no less unexpected than favourable to their pro-
grefs, they had been allowed' to penetrate into the heart of a
powerful kingdom, and' were now lodged in its capital,
without having once met with open oppoition from its mno-
narch. The Tlafcalans, however, had earnestly dissuaded them
from placing such confidence in Montezuma as to enter a city
of such a peculiar situation as Mexico, where that prince would
have them at mercy, flhut up as it were in a Inare, from which,
it was impossible to escape. They assured him that the Mex-
ican prielts had, in name of the Gods, counselled their fovc-
reign to admit the Spaniards into the capital, that, he lliglt

centre of a hoflile city, surrounded by multitudes sufficient to

diftinguifled refpec. But ought they to reckon upon this as
real, or to confider it as feigned ? Even if it were sincere,
could they promise on its continuance ? Their safety depended
upon the will of a monarch in whose attachment they had no
reason to confide', and an order flowing from his caprice, or a
word uttered by him in passion, might decide irrevocably con-

his horse killed, and one Spaniard had been surrounded by the
enemy and taken alive; that the head of this unfortunate cap-

to convince the people that their invaders were not immortal,
had been ent to Mexico b. Cortes, though alarmed with this '9
intelligence, as an indication of Montezuma's hoffile intentions,
had continued his march. But as oon as he entered Mexico,
he became sensible, that, from an excels of confidence in the fu-
perior valour and discipline of his troops, as well as from the
disadvantage of having nothing to guide him in an unknown
country, but the defedtive intelligence which he received from
people with whom his mode of communication was very inper-
fed, he had pushed forward into a situation, where it was dif-
ficult to continue, and from which it was dangerous to retire.
Disgrace, and perhaps ruin, was the certain consequence of at-
tempting the latter. The success of his enterprifc depended
upon supporting the high opinion which the pcople of New
Spain had formed with refped to the irrcfifiible power of his
arms. Upon the first symptom of timidity on his part, their
veneration would cease, and Montezuma, whom fear alone re-
firained at present, would let loose upon him the whole force
of his empire. At the fame time, he knew that the counte-
nance of his own fovercign was to be obtained only by a scrics
of vicorics, and that nothing but the merit of extraordinary
success could screen his condu from the ccnulre of irregularity.
From all tlhee considerations, it was neccfilury to maintain his
fation, and to extricate himself out of tle diflicultics in which
one bold fep had involved him, by venturing upon another
fill bolder. The situation was trying, but his mind was equal
to it; and after revolving the matter with deep) attention, lie
fixed upona plan no less extraordinary than daring. 1 e pro-

tezuma in his power, to acquire the supreme direction of their

made no doubt of being secure from any effort of their viot
lence.

His manner THIS he immediately proposed to his officers. The timid
of executing
this. g artled at a measure so audacious, and raised objections. The

more intelligent and resolute, conscious that it was the only
resource in which there appeared any profped of safety, warmly
approved of it, and brought over their companions so cordially
to the fame opinion, that it was agreed instantly to make the
attempt. At his usual hour of viiiting Montezuma, Cortes
went to the palace, accompanied by Alvarado, Saudoval, Lugo,
Velasquez de Leon, and Davila, five of his principal officers,
and as many trusty soldiers. Thirty chosen men followed, not
in regular order, but sauntering at ome diflance, as if they
had no object but curiosity; finall parties were posted at proper
intervals, in all the fireets leading from the Spanish quarters to
the court; and the remainder of his troops, with the Tlafcalan
allies, were under arms, ready to ally out on the first alarm.
Cortes and his attendants were admitted without suspicion; the
Mexicans retiring, as usual, out of respect. He addressed the
monarch in a tone very different from that which he had em-
ployed in former conferences, reproaching him bitterly as the
author of the violent assault made upon the Spaniards by one of
his officers, and demanded public reparation for the loss which
he had fultained by the death of ome of his companions, as

well

well as for the insult offered to the great prince whose servants B O

they were. Montezuma, confounded at this unexpected accu- -
fation, and changing colour either from consciousness of guilt, '159'
or rom feeling the indignity with which he was treated, as-
ferted his own innocence with great earnestness, and as a proof
of it, gave orders instantly to bring Qualpopoca and his accom-
plices prisoners to Mexico. Cortes replied, with seeming com-
plaifance, that a declaration so respectable left no doubt remain-
ing in his own mind, but that something more was requisite to
satisfy his followers, who would never be convinced that Mon-
tezuma did not harbour hostile intentions against them, unless,
as an evidence of his confidence and attachment, he removed
from his own palace, and took up his residence in the Spanifl
quarters, where he should be served and honoured as became
a great monarch. The firfl mention of so strange a proposal
bereaved Montezuma of speech, and almost of motion. At
length, indignation gave him utterance, and he haughtily an-
fwered, " That persons of his rank were not accustomed volun-
tarily to give up themselves as prisoners, and were he mean
enough to do so, his subjeCts would not permit such an affront
to be offered to their sovereign." Cortes, unwilling to employ
force, endeavoured alternately to soothe and to intimidate him.
The altercation became warm; and having continued above
three hours, Velasquez de Leon, an impetuous and gallant
young man, exclaimed with impatience, " Why waste more
time in vain ? Let us either seize him instantly, or flab him to
the heart." The threatening voice and fierce gestures with
which these words were uttered, struck Montezuma. The Spa-
niards, he was fenfiblc, had now proceeded so far, as left him
no hope that they would recede. His own danger was immi-

cari:,l to die

tcrs. to question the will of their mailer, but carried him in silent

pomp, all bathed in tears, to the Spanili quarters. When it was
known that the firangers were conveying away the emperor,
the people broke out into the wildest transports of grief and
rage, threatening the Spaniards with immediate destruction, as
the puniihment justly due to their impious audacity. But as
soon as Montezuma appeared with a seeming gaiety of counte-
nance, and waved his hand, the tumult was hushed, and upon
his declaring it to be of his own choice that he went to reside
for rome time among his new friends, the multitude, taught to
revere every intimation of their sovereign's pleasure, quietly
dispersed '.

of the attempt, or the success of the execution; and were not
all the circumfiances of this extraordinary tranfation authenti-
eated by the most unquestionable evidence, they would appear
so wild and extravagant, as to go far beyond the bounds of that
verisimilitude which muff be preserved even in fictitious narra-
tions.

MONTEZUMA was received in the Spanish quarters with all

the ceremonious refped which Cortes had promilic. Ile was
attended by his own domestics, and served with his usual state.
His principal officers- had free access to him, and he. carried on
all the funtions of government as if he had been at perfect
liberty. The Spaniards, however, watched him with all
the scrupulous -vigilance natural in guarding such an important
prize ', endeavouring at the fame time to booth and reconcile
him to his situation, by every external demonfration of rcgard
and attachment. But from captive princes the hour of humi-
liation and suffering is never far (iflant. Quailpopoca, his son,
and five of the principal officers who served under him, were
brought prisoners to the capital, in consequence of the orders
which Montezuma had iued. The emperor gave ihem up to
Cortes, that he might inquire into the nature of their crime,
and determine their punifhnmcut. They were formally tried
by a Spanish court-martial; and though they had ated no
other part than what became loyal fubjeas and brave men, in
obeying the orders of their lawful sovereign, and in opposing
the invaders of their country, they were condemned to be burnt
alive. The execution of such atrocious deeds is fcldlom long
suspended. The unhappy victims were inlantly led forth.
The pile on which they were laid was composed of the weapons
collected in the royal magazine for the public defence. An
innumerable multitude of Mexicans bcheld, in silent aflonifli-
ment, the double insult offered to the majesty of their empire,
an officer of diftintion committed to the flames by the autho-
rity of firangers, for having done what he owed in duty to lis
natural fovcreign; and the arms provided by the forcfiglt of

BUT these were not the most hocking indignities which

they had to bear. Cortes, convinced that Qualpopoca wduld
not have ventured to attack Efcalan'te without orders from
his mailer, was not satisfied with inflicting vengeance on
the initrument employed in committing that crime, while the
author of it escaped with impunity. Just before Qualpopoca
was led out to susser, Cortes entered the apartment of Monte-
zuma, followed by ome of his officers, and a soldier carrying
a pair of fetters; and approaching the monarch with a fern
countenance, told him, that as the persons who were now to
undergo the punishment which they merited, had charged
him as the cause of the outrage committed, it was necessary
that he likewise should make atonement for that guilt; then
turning away abruptly, without waiting for a reply, com-
manded the soldiers to clap the fetters on his legs. The orders
were inflantly executed. The disconsolate monarch, trained
up with an idea that his person was sacred and inviolable, and
confidering this profanation of it as the prelude of immediate
death, broke out into loud lamentations and complaints. His
attendants, speechless with horror, fell at his feet, bathing
them with their tears; and bearing up the fetters in their hands,
endeavoured with officious tenderness to lighten their prelfure.
Nor did their grief and despondency abate, until Cortes re-
turned from the execution with a 'cheerful countenance, and
ordered the fetters to be taken off. As Montezuma's spirits
had funk with unmanly dejeaion, they now rose into indecent
joy; and with an unbecoming transition, he pased at once

IN thpfe tranfacions, as represented by the Spanish hifto- Reafonsof

Cortes's con.

rianpr we search in vain for the qualities which diflinguil du.s
other parts of Cortes's conduat. To usurp a jurisdiCtion which
could not belong to a f-anger, who assumed no higher cha-
raaer than that of an ambassador fror a foreign prince, and,
under colour of it, to inflic a capital punishment on men whose
conduc entitled them to esteem, appears an a of barbarous
cruelty. To put the monarch of a great kingdom in irons,
and, after such ignominious treatment, suddenly to release him,
seems to be a display of power no less inconsiderate than wan-
ton. According to their representation, no account can be
given either of the one aion or the other, but that Cortes, in-
toxicated with success, and presuming on the ascendant which
he had acquired over the minds of the Mexicans, thought no-
thipg too bold for him to undertake, or too dangerous to exe-
cute. But, in one view, these proceedings, however repug-
nant to justice and humanity, may have flowed from that artful
policy which regulated every part of Cortes's behaviour. The
Mexicans had conceived the Spaniards to be an order of beings
superior to men. It was of the utmost consequence to cherifl
this illusion, and to keep up the veneration it inspired. Cortes
wiihed that shedding the blood of a Spaniard should be deemed
the most heinous of all crimes; and nothing appeared better
calculated to establish this opinion, than to condemn the first
Mexicans who had ventured to commit it, to a cruel death,
and to oblige their monarch himeiflf to submit to a mortifying
indignity, as an expiation for being accessary to their guilt .

B 0 0 K THE rigour with which Cortes punished the unhappy per-
-----' sons who firfi presumed to lay violent hands upon his followers,
The pov'er seems accordingly to have made all the impression that he de-
aied'ortes fired. The pirit of Montezuma was not only overawed, but

s1520 fuibdued. During fix months that Cortes remained in Mexico,

the monarch continued in the Spanish quarters, with an ap-
pearance of as entire fatisfatiion and tranquillity, as if he had
resided there not from constraint, but through choice. His
ministers and officers attended him as usual. He took cog-
nizance of all affairs; every order was issued in his name.
The external afpe of government appearing the fame, and
all' its ancient forms being scrupulously observed, the people
were so little sensible of any change, that they obeyed the man-
dates of their monarch with the fame submissive reverence as
ever. Such was the dread which both Montezuma and his
fubjeds had of the SFaniards, or such the veneration in which
they held them, that no attempt was made to deliver their
sovereign from confinement; and though Cortes, relying on
this ascendant which he had acquired over their minds, permit-
ted him not only to visit his temples, but to make hunting ex-
curfions beyond the lake, a guard of a few Spaniards carried
with it such terror as to intimidate the multitude, and secure
the captive monarch f.

Tiius, by the fortunate temerity of Cortes in fcizing Mon-

tezuma, the Spaniards at once secured to themselves more exten-
five authority in the Mexican empire than it was poflible to
have acquired in a long course of time by open force; and
they exercised more abfolutc sway in the name of another than
they could have done in their own. The arts of poliffled

nations in fubjeding such as are less improved, have been nearly B 0o K
the fame in every period. The system of screening a foreign --
usurpation, under the fanaion of authority derived from the 15Zo0
natural rulers of a country, the device of employing the ma-
giftrates and forms already eflablifled as infiruments to intro-
duce a new dominion, of which we are apt to boast as sublime
refinements in policy peculiar to the present age, were inven-
tions of a more early period, and had been tried with success
in the Weft, long before they were pratifed in the East.

CORTES availed himself to the utmost of the power which Use which he

makes of it,

he possessed by this means. He sent ome Spaniards, whom
he judged best qualified for such commiflions, into different
parts of the empire, accompanied by persons of diflintion,
whom Montezuma appointed to attend them both as guides
and protenors. They visited mofi of the provinces, viewed
their foil and productions, surveyed with particular care the
diftriAs which yielded gold or silver, pitched upon several
places as proper stations for future colonies, and endeavoured
to prepare the minds of the people for submitting to the Spanifl
yoke. While they were thus employed, Cortes, in the name
and by the authority of Montezuma, degraded some of the prin-
cipal officers in the empire, whose abilities or independent spirit
excited his jealousy, and fubflituted in their place persons less
capable or more obsequious.

ONE thing still was wanting to complete his ecurity. He

wished to have such command of the lake as might ensure a re-
treat, if, either from levity or difgufl, the Mexicans should take
arms againf him, and break down the bridges or causeways. This,
too, his own address, and the facility of Montezuma, enabled him

VOL. II. K to

B °0 K to accompliih. Having frequently entertained his prisoner with

V.

. -X---. pompous accounts of the European marine and art of navigation,
1520' he awakened his curiosity to fee those moving palaces that made

their way through the water without oars. Under pretext of
gratifying this desire, Cortes persuaded him to appoint some
of his fubjeds to fetch part of the naval stores deposited at Vera
Cruz to Mexico, and to employ others in cutting down and
preparing timber. With their afliftance, the Spanish carpen-
ters soon completed two brigantines, which afforded a frivolous
amusement to the monarch, and were confidered by Cortes as a
certain resource, if he should be obliged to retire.

Montezuma ENCOURAGED by so many instances of the monarch's tame
acknow-
ledges him- submission to his evill, Cortes ventured to put it to a proof still
felfa vasal more trying. He urged Montezurna to acknowledge himself
of Spain.

a vassal of the king of Caflile, to hold his crown of him as fu-
perior, and to subjed his dominions to the payment of an
annual tribute. With this requisition, the last and molt hum-
bling that can be made to one possessed of sovereign authority,
Montezuma was so obsequious as to comply. He called together
the chief men of his empire, and in a solemn harangue, remind-
ing them of the traditions and prophecies which led them to e-
peat the arrival of a people sprung from the fame flock with
themselves, in order to take pofleffion of the supreme power, he
declared his belief that the Spaniards were this promired race;
that therefore he recognized the right of their monarch to govern
the Mexican empire, would lay his crown at his feet, and obey
him as a tributary. While uttering there words, Montezuma
discovered how deeply he was affected in making such a facri-
fice. Tears and groans frequently interrupted his discourse.
Overawed and broken as his spirit was, it fill retained such, a

ifnfc
66

sense of dignity, as to feel that pang which pierces the heart B 0\0 K
of princes when constrained to resign independent power. The ---
firfi mention of such a resolution struck the assembly dumb with I5Zo.
aflonifhment,* This was followed by a fullen murmur of for-
row mingled with indignation, which indicated ome violent
eruption of rage to be near at hand. This Cortes foresaw,
and seasonably- interposed to prevent it, by declaring that his
mafler had no intention to deprive Montezuma of the royal

laws of the Mexican empire. This aurance, added to their
dread of the Spaninf power, and to the authority of their mo-
narch's example, extorted a reluctant content from the assem-

very liberal contributions. The Spaniards now collected all the
treasure which had been either voluntarily betlowed upon them
at different times by Montezuma, or had been extorted from his
people under various pretexts; and having melted the gold and
silver, the value of these, without including jewels and ornaments
of various kinds, which were preserved on account of their curious
worklnanlhip, amounted to fix hundred thousand p/bs. The fol- Divifon ofit,

--_-- anid by some of the officers, towards defraying the expence of

5 *0 fitting out the armament, were then deducted. The remainder

was divided among the army, including the garrison of Vera
Cruz, in proportion to their different ranks. After so many
defalcations, the share of a private man did not exceed a hun-
dred pesos. This fum fell so far below their sanguine expec-
tations, that some soldiers rejected it with scorn, and others
murmured so loudly at this cruel disappointment of their hopes,
that it required all the address of Cortes, and no small exertion
of his liberality, to appease them. The complaints of the army
were not altogether destitute of foundation. As the crown had
contributed nothing towards the equipment or success of the
armament, it was not without regret that the soldiers beheld it
sweep away so great a proportion of the treasure purchased by
their blood and toil. What fell to the share of their general
appeared, according to the ideas of wealth in the sixteenth cen-
tury, an enormous fum. Some of Cortes's favourites had fe-
cretly appropriated to their own use several ornaments of gold,.
which neither paid the royal fifth, nor were brought into ac-
count as part of the common flock. It was, however, so ma-
nifeftly the interest of Cortes at this period to make a large
remittance to the king, that it is highly probable those conceal-
ments were not of great consequence.

fimall q;n- descriptions given by historians of the ancient splendour of

Mexico, or by confidering the productions of its mines in
modern times. But, among the ancient Mexicans, gold and
silver were not the standards by which the worth of other

derived from this circumstance, were no farther in request than ---
as they furnished materials for ornaments and trinkets. These
were either consecrated to the gods in their temples, or were
worn as marks of diftintion by their princes and some of their
most eminent chiefs. As the consumption of the precious me-
tals was inconsiderable, the demand for them was not such as
to put either the ingenuity or industry of the Mexicans on the
firetch, in order to augment their store. They were altogether
uracquainted with the art of working the rich mines with which
their country abounded. What gold they had was gathered in
the beds of rivers, native, and ripened into a pure metallic
slate'. The utmost effort of their labour in search of it was to
wash the earth carried down by torrents from the mountains,
and to pick out the grains of gold which subsided; and even
this simple operation, according to the report of the persons
whom Cortes appointed to survey the provinces where there
was a profpea of finding mines, they performed very unfkil-
fully k. From all those caufcs, the whole mass of gold in pof-
feflion of the Mexicans was not great. As silver is rarely found
pure, and their art was too rude to conduct the process for re-
fining it in a proper manner, the quantity of this metal was
fill less considerable'. Thus, though the Spaniards had ex-
erted all the power which they pofeffied in Mexico, and often
with indecent rapacity, in order to gratify their predominant
passion, and though Montezuma had fondly exhausted his stores,
in hopes of satiating their thirst for gold, the product of both,
which probably included a great part of the bullion in the em-
pire, did not rife in value above what has been mentioned"'.

among the Mexicans, was formed into such a regular and com-
plete system, that its institutions naturally took fat hol4 of the
mind; and while the rude tribes in other parts of America were
easily induced to relinquish a few notions and. rites, so loose
and arbitrary as hardly to merit the name of a public religion,
the Mexicans adhered tenaciously to their mode of worship,
which, however barbarous, was accompanied with fucli order
and solemnity as to render it the objea of-veneration. Cortes,
finding all his attempts ineffedual thake th:e conflancy of
Montezuma, was so much enraged at his ohftinacy, that in a
transport of zeal he led out his soldiers to throw down the
idols in the great temple by force. But the priests taking arms
in defence of their altars, and the people crowding with great
ardour to support them, Cortes's prudence overruled his zeal,
and induced him to defifl from his rash attempt, after diflodg-

this purpose. But as it might prove fatal to the captive mo- B o K

V.

narch to attempt either the one or the other by violence, he ..
was willing to try more gentle means, Having called Cortes 1520'
into his presence, he observed that now, as all the purposes of his
embassy were fully accommplifhed, the gods had declared their
will, and the people signified their desire that he and his follow-
ers hould instantly depart out of the empire. With this he re-
quired'thsn to comply, or unavoidable deftrution would fall
suddenly on their heads. The tenor of this unexpected requi-
fition, as well as the determined tone in which it was uttered,
left Cortes no room to doubt that it was the result of some deep
scheme concerted between Montezuma and his fubjedts. He
quickly perceived that he might derive more advantage from a
seeming conmliance with the monarch's inclination, than from
an ill-timed attempt todhange or to oppose it, and replied, with
great composure, that he had already begun to prepare for re-
turning to his own country; but as he had destroyed the vessels
in which he arrived, some time was requisite for building other
flips. This appeared reasonable. A number of Mexicans
were-fent to Vera Cruz to cut down timber, and ome Spanifi
carpenters were appointed to superintend the work. Cortes
flattered hirnfelf that during this interval, he might either find
means to avert the threatened danger, or receive such reinforce-
ments as would enable him to despise it.

ALMOST nine months were elapsed since Portocarrero and Anxiety and

Montejo had failed with his dispatches to Spain; and he daily Cojes=.
cxpeced their return with a confirmation of his authority from
the king. Without this, his condition was insecure and pre-
carious, and after all the great things which he had done, it
might be his doom to bear the name and susser the punishment

B K of a traitor. Rapid and extensive as his progress had been, he

V.
v- _ could not hope to complete the reduction of a great empire with
'5Z" f fnall a body of men, which by this time the diseases of the

climate had considerably thinned; nor could he apply for re-
cruits to the Spanish settlements in the islands until he received
the royal approbation of his proceedings.

Tbe.rrival WHILE he remained in this cruel fituatibn, anxious about
ot alew ar- what was past, uncertain with refped to the future, and, by

the late declaration of Montezuma, oppressed with a new addi-
tion of cares, a Mexican courier arrived with an account of
some hips having appeared on the coast. Cortes, with fond
credulity, imagining that his messengers were returned from
Spain, and that the completion of all ly wishes ad hopes was
at hand, imparted the glad tidings to his companions, who re-
ceived them with transports of mutual gratulation. Their joy
was not of long continuance. A courier from Sandoval, whom
Cortes had appointed to succeed Efcalante in command at Vera
Cruz, brought certain information that the armament was fitted
out by Velasquez, governor of Cuba, and instead of bringing
the aid which they expected, threatened them with immediate
deftruafion.

lited out by TuE motives which prompted Velasquez to this violent mea-
Vc.-itlez. sure are obvious. From the circumstances of Cortes's depar-

ture, it was impossible not to fufpedc his intention of throwing
off all dependence upon him. His neglecing to tranimit any
account of his operations to Cuba, strengthened this ffpicion,
which was at last confirmed, beyond doubt, by the indiscretion
of the officers whom Cortes ent to Spain. They, from some
motive, which is not clearly explained by the contemporary

historians, touched at the island of Cuba, contrary to the per- B 0 O K

emptory orders of their general °. By this means Velasquez ,--'
not only learned that Cortes and his followers, after formally IjZ
renouncing all connection with him, had eflablifhed an indc-
pendent colony in New Spain, and were soliciting the king to
confirm their proceedings by his authority; but he obtained
particular information concerning the opulence of the country,
the valuabl presents which Cortes had received, and the invit-
ing profpets of success that opened to his view. Every pal-
son which can agitate an ambitious mind; hame, at having been
so grossly overreached; indignation, at being betrayed by the
man whom he had feleded as the objed of his favour and con-
fidence; grief, for having wafted his fortune to aggrandize an
enemy; and,4efpair of recovering so fair an opportunity of eta-
blifling his fame and extending his power, now raged in the
bosom of Velasquez. All these, with united force, excited him
to make an extraordinary effort in order to be avenged on the
author of his wrongs, and to wrest from him his usurped autho-
rity and conquests. Nor did he want the appearance of a good
title to justify such an attempt. The agent whom he sent to
Spain with an account of Grijalva's voyage, had met with a
most favourable reception; and from the specimens which he
produced, such high expecations were formed concerning the
opulence of New Spain, that Velasquez was authorised to pro-
fecute the discovery of the country, and appointed governor of
it during life, with more extensive power and privileges than
had been granted to any adventurer from the time of Co-
lumbus P. Elated by this distinguishing mark of favour, and

lence of the passions with which he was animated; and in a
short time an armament was completed, consisting of eighteen
hips, which had on board fourscore horse-men, eight hun-
dred foot soldiers, of which eighty were musketeers, and a
hundred and twenty cross-bow men, together with a train of
twelve pieces of cannon. As Velasquez's experience of the
fatal confequcnc. of committing to another what he ought to
have executed himself, had not rendered him more enterprif-
ing, he vefted-the command of this formidable body, which;
in the infancy o the Spanish power in America, merits the
appellation of an army, iPamphilo de Narvaez, with inftruc-
tions to seize Cortes and his principal officers, to fend them pri-
foners to him, and then to complete the discovery and conquest-
of the country in his ame..

The proceed- AFTER a prosperous voyage, Narvaez landed his men with-
ings of Ndr-

Apr'' Cortes had sent to fcarch for mines in that diftric&, immediately

joined him. By this accident, he not only received information
concerning the progress and situation of Cortes, but as these
soldiers had made some pr.ogress in the knowledge of the Mex-
ican language, he acquired interpreters, by whose means he
was enabled to hold ome intercourse with the people of the
country. But, according to the low cunning of deserters, they
framed their intelligence with more attention to what they
thought would be agreeable, than to what they knew to be true;

and represented the situation of Cortes to be so desperate, and B °ov K
the disaffection of his fllowers to be so general, as increased -
the natural presumption and confidence of Narvaez. His firfl: 15'
operation, however, might have taught him not to rely on
their partial accounts. H-aving ent to summon the governor
of Vera Cruz to surrender, Guevara, a pricfi whom he employ-
ed in that service, made the requisition with such insolence,
that Sandoval, an officer of high spirit, and zealously attached
to Cortes, instead of complying with his demands, seized him
and his attendants, and sent them in chains to Mexico.

CORTES received them not like enemies, but as friends, and Cortes deeply

ali n cd.

condemning the severity of Sandoval, set them immediately at
liberty. By this well-timed clemency, seconded by carefles and
presents, he gained their confidence, and drew from them fucli
particulars concerning the force and intentions of Narvaez, as
gave him a view of the impending danger in its full extent.
He had not to contend now with half-naked Indians, no match
for him in war, and still more inferior in the arts of policy,
but to take the field against an army in courage and martial
discipline equal to his own, in number far superior, acting un-
der the fandtion of royal authority, and commanded by an
officer of known bravery. He was informed that Narvaez,
more solicitous to gratify the resentment of Velasquez, than at-
tentive to the honour or interest of his country, had begun his
intercourse with the natives, by representing him and his fol-
lowers as filgitives and outlaws, guilty of rebellion againfl their
own sovereign, and of injllice in invading the Mexican em-
pire, and had declared to them that his sole objct in visiting
the country was to punifil the Spaniards, and to rccue theic
from oppression. I-Ie 1(on perceived that the fime unfavour-

I 2 able

V.

.-.--' that Narvaez had found means to afiure him, that as the conduc
1520. of those who kept him under restraint was highly displeasing to

the king his mafier, he had it in charge not only to rescue an
injured monarch from confinement, but to reinflate him in
the possession of his ancient power and independence. Ani-
mated with this profpe of being set free from fubjedion to
firangers, the provinces began openly to revolt from Cortes,
and to regard Narvaez as a deliverer no less able than willing
to save them. Montezuma himself kept up a secret intercourse
with the new commander, and seemed to court him as a person
superior in power and dignity to those Spaniards whom he had
hitherto revered as the firit of men B.

His delibera- SUCH were the various afpeds of danger and difficulty which
tions con-
cerning his presented themselves to the view of Cortes- No situation can

neral, or where the choice of the plan which ought to be adopt-
ed was more difficult. If he mhould wait the approach of Nar-
vaez in Mexico, deftruaion seemed to be unavoidable; for
while the Spaniards pressed him from without, the inhabitants,
whose turbulent spirit he could hardly restrain with all his
authority and attention, would eagerly lay hold on such a fa-
vourable opportunity of avenging all their wrongs. If he should
abandon the capital, set the captive monarch at liberty, and
march out to meet the enemy; he mufl at once forego the fruitc
of all his toils and vidories, and relinquish advantages which
could not be recovered without extraordinary efforts, and infi-
nite danger. If, instead of employing force, he liould have

tion with Narvaez; the natural haughtiness of that officer,. ---
augmented by consciousness of his present superiority, sorbad L20O
him to cherish any sanguine hope of success. After revolving
every scheme with deep attention, Cortes fixed upon that which,
in execution was. most hazardous, but, if successful, would
prove most beneficial to his country; and with the decisive in-
trepidity, suited to desperate situations, determined to make
one bold effort for vidcory under every disadvantage, rather
than sacrifice his own conquefls and the Spanish interest in
Mexico.

service he employed Olmedo, his chaplain, to whose charaCter
the fundtion was well suited, and who possessed, besides, such
prudence and address as qualified him to carry on the secret
intrigues in which Cortes placed his chief confidence. Nar-
vaez rejected, with icorn, every scheme of accommodation that
Olmedo proposed, and was with difficulty refirained from lay-
ing violent hands on him and his attendants. I-e met, how-
ever, with a more favourable reception among his followers, to,
many of whom he delivered letters, either from Cortes or his
officers, their ancient friends and companions. Cortes artfully
accompanied thect with presents of rings, chains of gold, and
other trinkets of value, which inspired those needy adventurers
with high ideas of the wealth that he had acquired, and with.
envy of their good fortune who were engaged in his service.

'jO' .-whatever party hould prevail, must shake, and perhaps sub-

vert the Spanish power, in a country where it was so imper-
fedly eablifhed. Narvaez disregarded both, and by a public
proclamation denounced Cortes and his adherents rebelsand
enemies to their country. Cortes, it is probable, was not much
surprised at the untractable arrogance of Narvaez; and, after
having given such a proof of his own pacific disposition as might
justify his recourse to other means, he determined to advance
towards an enemy whom he had laboured in vain to appease.

ted a great city, with all the wealth he had araffed, and, what
was still of greater importance, the person of the imprisoned mo-
narch. His utmost art was employed in concealing fiomn Mon-
tezuma the real cause of his march. He laboured to persuade
him, that the firangers who had lately arrived were his friends
and fellow-fubjeds; an'd that, after a hort interview with
them, they would depart together, and return to their own
country. The captive prince, unable to comprehend the de-
signs of the Spaniards, or to reconcile what he now heard with
the declarations of Narvacz, and afraid to discover any fymptoni
of suspicion or diflruft of Cortcs, promilcd to remain quietly
in the Spanifll quarters, and to cultivate the fame fiiendflip

His flrength, even after it was reinforced by the juncion of Number of

Sandoval and the garrison of Vera Cruz, did not exceed two his toops'
hundred and fifty men. As he hoped for success chiefly from
the rapidity of his motions, his troops were not encumbered
either with baggage or artillery. But as he dreaded extremely
the impression which the enemy might make with their cavalry,
he had provided against this danger with the foresight and fa-
gacity which distinguish a great commander. Having observcd
that the Indians in the province of Chinantla ud spears of ex-
traordinary length and force, he armed his soldiers with these,
and accustomed them to that deep and compac arrangement
which the use of this formidable weapon, the best perhaps that
ever was invented for defence, enabled them to assume.

WITH this small but firm battalion, Cortes advanced towards Continues to

Zempoalla, of which Narvaez had taken possession. During Yc'catca
his march, he made repeated attempts towards ome accommo-
dation with his opponent. But Narvaez requiring that Cortes
and his followers should instantly recognize his title to be go-
vernor of New Spain, in virtue of the powers which he derived
from Velasquez, and Cortes rcfufing to submit to any autho-
rity which was not founded on a commiflion from the emperor
Pimfelf, under whose immediate protection he and his adhe-
rents had placed their infant colony, all these attempts proved
fruitless. The intercourfc, however, which this occasioncd
between the two parties, proved of no finall advantage to Cortes,
as it afforded him an opportunity of gaining ome of Narvacz's
officcrs by liberal prelfcnts, of softening others by a ilnblancc

of'

of moderation, and of dazzling all by the appearance of wealth
among his troops, mofl of his foldicrs having converted their
£hare of the Mexican gold into chains, bracelets, and other or-
naments, which they displaycd with military oflentation. Nar-
vaez and a little junto of his creatures excepted, all the army
leaned towards an accommodation 'with their countrymen.
This discovery of their inclination irritated his violent temper
almost to madness. In a transport of rage, he set a price upon
the head of Cortes, and of his principal officers; and having
learned that he was now advanced within a league of Zem-
poalla with his finall body of men, he considered this as an
insult which merited immediate chafiftement, and marched out
with all his troops to offer him battle.

-4

BUT Cortes was a leader of greater abilities and experience

than to fight an enemy so far superior in number, and so much
better appointed, on equal ground. Having taken his flation
on the opposite bank of the river de Canoas, where he knew
that he could not be attacked, he beheld the approach of the
enemy without concern, and disregarded this vain bravade.
It was then the beginning of the wet season t, and the rain had
poured down, during a great part of the day, with the violence
peculiar to the torrid zone. The follbwers of Narvaez, unac-
customed to the hardships of military service, murmured so
much at being thus fruitlessly exposed, that, from their unfol-
dier-like impatience, as well as his own contempt of his ad-
verfary, their general permitted them to retire to Zempoalla.
The very circumstance which induced them to quit the field,
encouraged Cortes to form a scheme, by which he hoped at
once to terminate the war. He observed, that his hardy vete-

fall, without a single tent or any flelter whatsoever to cover
them, were so far from repining at hardihips that were become 11'
familiar to them, that they were still frelh and alert for service.
He foresaw that the enemy would naturally give themselves tip
to repose after their fatigue, and that, judging of the conduc
of others by their own effeminacy, they would deem themnfelves
perfetly secure at a season so unfit for ation. He resolved,
therefore, to fall upon them in the dead of night, when the
surprise and terror of this unexpected attack might more than
compensate the inferiority of his numbers. His soldiers, fen-
fible that no resource remained but in some desperate effort of
courage, approved of the measure with such warmth, that
Cortes, in a military oration which he addressed to them before
they began their march, was more solicitous to temper than to
inflame their ardour. He divided them into three parties.
At the head of the first he placed Sandoval; entrusting this gal-
lant officer with the most dangerous and important service, that
of seizing the enemy's artillery, which was planted before the
principal tower of the temple, where Narvaez had fixed his
head-quarters. Chrifloval deOlid commanded the second, with
orders to assault the tower, and lay hold on the general. Cortes
himself conduded the third and smallest division, which was to
adc as a body of reserve, and to support the other two as there
should be occasion. Having paflcd the river de Canoas, which
was much swelled with the rains, not without difficulty, the
water reaching almost to their chins, they advanced in profound
silence, without beat of drum, or found of any warlike inflru-
ment; each man armed with his sword, his dagger, and his
Chinanllan fpcar. Narvaez, remiss in proportion to his fccu-
rity, had polled only two ccntinels to watch the motions of an

V.
--,I --i wa's seizcd by the advanced guard of Cortes's troops, the other

made his cfcape, and hurrying to the town with all the pre-
cipitation of fear and zeal, gave such timely notice of the
enemy's approach, that there was full leisure to have prepared
for their reception. But, through the arrogance and infatua-
tion of Narvaez, this important interval was loft. He imputed
this alarm to the cowardice of the centinel, and treated with
derision the idea of being attacked by forces so unequal to his
own. The shouts of Cortes's soldiers, ruffling on to the assault,
convinced him at last, that the danger which he despised was
real. The rapidity with which they advanced was such, that
only one cannon cpuld be fired, before Sandoval's party closed
with the enemy, drove them from their guns, and began to
force their way up the Ileps of the tower. Narvaez, no less
brave in ation than presumptuous in conduc, armed himself
in hafle, and by his voice and example animated his men to the
combat. Olid advanced to sustain his companions; and Cortes
himself, rushing to the front, conducted and added new vigour
to the attack. The compact order in which this small body
prefled on, and the impenetrable front which they presented
and over- with their long spears, bore down all opposition before it. They

os him, had now reached the gate, and were fir-uggling to burst it open,

when a soldier having ft fire to the reeds with which the towel
was covered, compelled Narvacz to sally out. In the firlt en-
counter he was wounded in the eye with a spear, and falling to
the ground, was dragged down the steps, and in a moment clapt
in fetters. The cry of victory rcfounded among the troops of
Cortes. Those who had sallied out with their leader now main-
tained the conflict feebly, or began to furrendcr. Among the re-
mainder of his soldiers, stationed in two finaller towers of the

temple,

temple, terror and confusion prevailed. The darkness was so great, B 0 0 K
that they could not diflinguifh between their fiends and foes. '-
Their own artillery was pointed against them. Wherever they 1sZO.
turned their eyes, they beheld lights gleaming through the ob-
fcurity of night, which, though proceeding only from a variety
of shining infecs, that abound in moist and sultry climates,
their affrighted imaginations representcd as numerous bands of
mufketcers advancing with kindled matches to the attack. As-
ter a Ihort reffrtance, the ioldiers compelled their officers to
capitulate, and before morning all laid clown their arms, and
submitted quietly to their conquerors.

THIS complete victory proved more acceptable, as it was Thlccfles of

gained almost without bloodshed, only two soldiers being killed t'l5vi:"'r'
on the fide of Cortes, and two officers, with fifteen private men,
of the adverse faction. Cortes treated the vanquished not like
enemies, but as countrymen ant friends, and offered either to
fend them back directly to Cuba, or to take them into his ervice,
as partners in his fortune, on equal terms with his own soldiers.
This latter proposition, seconded by a seasonable diftiibution of
some prefcnts from Cortes, and liberal promises of more, opened
profpecs so agreeable to the romantic expetations which had
induced them to engage in tlis service, that all, a few partizans
of Narvacz excepted, cloced with it, and vied with each other
in profcfions of fidelity and attachmncnt to a general wholle re-

Spaniards.

Span operations after he began his march, he had not brought mat-

ters to such a speedy issue, even this decisive victory would
have come too late to have saved his companions whom he left
in Mexico. A few days after the discomfiture of Narvaez, a
courier arrived with an account that the Mexicans had taken
arms, and having seized and defiroyed the two brigantines, which
he had built in order to secure the command of the lake, had
attacked the Spaniards in their quarters, had killed several of
them and wounded more, had reduced to ashes their magazine
of provisions, and carried on hostilities with such fury, that,
though Alvarado and his men defended themselves with un-
daunted resolution, they must either be soon cut off by famine,
or fink under the multitude of their enemies. This revolt was
excited by motives which rendered it still more alarming. On
the departure of Cortes for Zempoalla, the Mexicans flattered
themselves, that the long-expeced opportunity of refloring
their sovereign to liberty, and of vindicating their country from
the odious dominion of firangers, was at length arrived; that
while the forces of their oppressors were divided, and the arms

of one party turned against the other, they might triumph with B O K
greater facility over both. Consultations were held, and schemes, I
formed with this intention. The Spaniards in Mexico, con- I5zo.
fcious of their own feebleness, fuilfced and dreaded those
machinations. Alvarado, though a gallant officer, possessed.
neither that extent of capacity, nor dignity of manners, by
which Cortes had acquired such an ascendant over the minds of
the Mexicans, as never allowed them to form a just estimate of
his weakness or of their own strength. Alvarado knew no mode
of upporting his authority but force. Instead of employing
address to disconcert the plans or to sooth the spirits of the
Mexicans, he waited the return of one of their solemn festivals,
when the principal persons in the empire were dancing, ac-
cording to custom, in the court of the great temple; he seized
all the avenues which led to it, and, allured partly by the rich.
ornaments which they wore in honour of their gods, and partly
by the facility of cutting off at once the authors of that con-
fpiracy which he dreaded, he fell upon them, unarmed and
unfufpicious of any danger, and massacred a great number,.
none escaping but such as made their way over the battlements
of the temple. An aion so cruel and treacherous filled not
only the city, but the whole empire, with indignation and
rage. All called aloud for vengeance ; and regardless of the
safety of their monarch, whose life was at the mercy of the
Spaniards, or of their own danger in afTaulting an enemy who
had been so long the objed of their terror, they committed all
those acts of violence of which Cortes received an account.

To him the danger appeared o imminent, as to admit nei- nic marche

ther of deliberation nor delay. Ile ft out infllantly wit all capi tal
his forces, and returned from Zermpoalla with no lts rapidity

than

B 0o K than he had advanced thither. At Tlafcala he was joined by

._^_-- two thousand chosen warriors. On entering the Mexican ter-
1520' ritories, he found that difaffeation to the Spaniards was not

confined to the capital. The principal inhabitants had deserted
the towns through which he pafied ; no person of note appear-
ing to meet him with the usual refpet; no provision was made
for the fubfitlence of his troops; and though he was permitted
to advance without opposition, the solitude and silence which
reigned in every place, and the horror with which the people
avoided all intercourse with him, discovered a deep-rooted an-
tipathy, that excited the most jult alarm. But, impiacable as
the enmity of the Mexicans was, they were so unacquainted
with the science of war, that they knew not how to take the
proper meafurea, either for their own safety or the dcltrution
of the Spaniards. UninftruQed by their former error in ad-
mitting a formidable enemy into their capital, instead of break-
ing down the causeways and bridges, by which they might
have inclosed Alvarado and his party, and have effetually
June 24. flopt the career of Cortes, they again suffered him to march

into the city without molel-ation, and to take quiet poffeflion
of his ancient station.

his designs. Some Mexicans who understood the Spanifi lan-
guage, heard the contemptuous words which Cortes uttered,
and reporting them to their countrymen, kindled their rage
anew. They were now convinced that the intentions of the
general were equally bloody with those of Alvarado, and that
his original purpose in visiting their country, had not been, as
he.pretended, to court the alliance of their fovcrcign, but to at-
tempt the conquest of his dominions. They resumed tleir arms Thle io!'nt

with the additional fury which this discovery inspircd, attacked tlc Mvci-
a considerable body of Spaniards who were marching towards Cl":
the great square in which the public market was held, anl
compelled them to retire with some loss. Emboldened by this
success, and delighted to ind that their oppressors were not in-
vincible, they advanced next day with extraordinary martial
pomp to afTault the Spaniards in their quarters. Their number
was formidable, and their undaunted courage Hill more so.
Though the artillery pointed against their numerous battalions,
crouded together in narrow streets, swept off multitudes at every
discharge; though every blow of the Spanifi weapons fell
with mortal effec- upon their naked bodies, the impctuolity of
the assault did not abatc. Frefl mnci rulcld forward to occupy

k--4-_ people, who seemed at firfl to submit tamely to the yoke, and
Diarelorf had continued so long passive under it. The soldiers of Nar-
the Spaniards. vaez, who fondly imagined that they followed Cortes to share

in the poils of a conquered empire, were astonished to find
that they were involved in a dangerous war, with an enemy
'whose vigour was flill unbroken, and loudly execrated their
own weakness, in giving such easy credit to the delusive pro-
miles of their new leader . But surprise and complaints were
of no avail. Some immediate and extraordinary effort was re-
quifite to extricate themselves out of their present situation. As
soon as the approach of evening induced the Mexicans to retire,
in compliance with their national cuflom of ceasing from hofili-
ties with the setting fun, Cortes began to prepare for a ally,
with such a considerable force, as might either drive the ene-
my out of the city, or compel them to liften to terms of accom-
modation.

Cortes at- HE conducted, in person, the troops detined for this im-
tacks them
without fuc. portant service. Every invention known in the European art
cers. of war, as well as every precaution, suggested by his long ac-

quaintance with the Indian mode of fighting, were employed to
ensure success. But he found an enemy prepared and deter-
mined to oppose him. The force of the Mexicans was greatly
augmented by fresh troops, which poured in continually from
the country, and their animosity was in no degree abated.
They were led by their nobles, inflamed by the exhortations of
their priests, and fought in defence of their temples and fami-
lies, under the eye of their gods, and in presence of their wives

and children. Notwithstanding their numbers, and enthufi- B 0O K
aftic contempt of danger and death, wherever the Spaniards i--
could close with them, the filperiority of their discipline and o20'.
arms obliged them to give way. But in narrow fireets, and
where many of the bridges of communication were broken
down, they could seldom come to a fair rencounter, and the Spa-
niards, as they advanced, were exposed to howers of arrows
and stones from the tops of the houses. After a day of incef-
sant exertion, though vast numbers of the Mexicans fell, and
part of the city was burnt, the Spaniards, weary with the
slaughter, and harassed by multitudes which successively reliev-
ed each other, were obliged at length to retire, with the morti-
fication of having accomplished nothing so decisive as to com-
penfate the unusual calamity of twelve soldiers killed, and above
sixty wounded. Another ally, made with greater force, was
not more effecual, and in it the general himself was wounded
in the hand.

CORTES now perceived, too late, the fatal error into which Montezuma

ain.

he had been betrayed by his own contempt of the Mexicans,
and was satisfied that he could neither maintain his present fta-
tion in the centre of an hostile city, nor retire from it without
the most imminent danger. One resource still remained, to
try what effect the interposition of Montezuma might have to
tooth or overaw his fubjets. When the Mexicans approached
next morning to renew the'affault, that unfortunate prince, at
the mercy of the Spaniards, and reduced to the fad neceflity of

before the Spanish soldiers, appointed. to. cover Montezuma.
with. their buckleis, had time to lift them. in his defence, two.
arrows wounded the unhappy monarch,. and.the blow ofa ftona
on his temple struck him to the ground. On foeing him fall,,
the Mexicans were so much astonished, that, with a tranfitionr
not uncommon in popular tumults, they passed in a moment
from one extreme to the other., remorse succeeded to insult, and:
they fled with horror, as if the vengeance.of Heaven were pur-
fling the crime which they had committed. The Spaniards,,
without molestation, carried Montezuma to his apartments,.
and Cortes hastened thither to console him .under his misfortune.
But the unhappy monarch now perceived how low he was funk,.
and the haughty spirit which seemed to have been to long. ex-
tin.&, returning, he scorned to surviv-e this last humiliation, and.
to protraS an ignominious life, not only as- the prisoner andc
tool of his enemies, but as the objed of contempt or dctefta-
tion among his iibjeds. In a transport- of rage he tore the
bandages from his wounds, and reflfed, with such obflinacy,,
to take any nourihmcnt, that he foon.enjed his wretched days,,

rejecing with disdain all the solicitations of the Spaniards to B OVO K
,embrace tlhe'Chriftian farth.

UPON the death of Montezuma, Cortes 'having loft all hope New con-

of bringing the Mexicans to any accommodation, saw no pro- 1''
fpectof safety but in attempting a retreat, and began to prepare
for it. But a sudden motion of the Mexicans engaged him in
new conflics. They took poffcflion of a high tower i the
great temple which overlooked the Spanish quarters, and plac-
ing there a garrison of their principal warriors, not a Spaniard
could fir without being exposed to their miflile weapons.
From this pofl it was necessary to dislodge them at any rilk,
and Juan de Efcobar, with a numerous detachment of chosen
soldiers, was ordered to make the attack. But Esgobar, though
a gallant officcr, and at the head of troops accuflomed to con.
quer, and who now fought under the eyes of their country-
men, was tlrice repulsed. Cortes, sensible that not only the
reputation but the safety of his army depended on the fucccfs
of this assault, ordered a buckler to be tied to his arm, as he
could not manage it with his wounded hand, and ruhecd with
his drawn sword into the thickest of the combatants. Encou-
raged by the presence of their general, the Spaniards returned to
the charge with such vigour, that they gradually forced their
way up the fleps, and drove the Mexicans to the platform at
the top of the tower. There a dreadful carnage began, when
two young Mlexicans of high rank, obfcrving Cortes as he ani-
mated his soldiers by his voice and example, resolved to facri-
lice their own lives in order to cut o the author of all the
calamities which desolated their country. They approached
him in a supplicant poflure, as if they had intended to lay
down their arms, and seizing him in a moment, hurried him

broke loose from their grasp, and the gallant youths perished
in this generous, though unsuccessful, attempt to save their
country. As oon as the Spaniards became masters of the
tower, they set fire to it, and without farther moleflation,
continued the preparations for their retreat.

The Spani- THIS became the more necessary, as the Mexicans were so
ards abandon
the city. much astonished at the last effort of the Spanilh valour, that

they began to change their whole system of hostility, and in-
stead of inceffanj attacks, endeavoured, by barricading the
streets, and breaking down the causeways, to cut off the com-
munication of the Spaniards with the continent, and thus to
starve an enemy whom they could not subdue. The first point
to be determined, was whether they should march out openly
in the face of day, when they could discern every danger, and
fee how to regulate their own motions, as well as how to resist
the assaults of the enemy; or whether they should endeavour
to retire secretly in the night. The latter was preferred, partly
from hopes that their national superstition would refrain the
Mexicans from venturing to attack them in the night, and
partly from their own fond belief in the predictions of a
private soldier, who having acquired universal credit by a
finattering of learning, and his pretensions to atrology, boldly
assured them of ficcefs, if they made their retreat in this man-
ner. They began to move, towards midnight, in three divi-
sions. Sandoval lcd the van; Pedro Alvarado, and Velasquez
de Ieon, had the conduct of the rear; and Cortes commanded
in the centre, where he placed the prisoners, among whom

were
92

were a son and two daughters of Montezuma, together with B o0 K
several Mexicans of diftindion, the artillery, the baggage, and ---
a portable bridge of timber, intended to be laid over the 152
breaches in the causeway. They marched in profound silence
along the causeway which led to Tacuba, because it was flortcr
than any of the reft, and, lying most remote from the road to-
wards Tlafcala and the ea coast, had been left more entire by
the Mexicans. They reached the first breach in it without
molestation, hoping that their retreat was undiscovered.

BUT the Mexicans, unperceived, had not only watched all Attacked by

the Mexicans,

their motions with attention, but had made proper dispositions
for a morl formidable attack. While the Spaniards were intent
upon placing their bridge in the breach, and occupied in con-
duding their horses and artillery along it, they were suddenly
alarmed with the tremendous found of warlike instruments,
and a general shout from an innumerable multitude of enemies;
the lake was covered with canoes; flights of arrows, and showers
of flones poured in upon them from every quarter; the Mcxi-
cans ruhing forward to the charge with fearless impetuosity,
as if they hoped in that moment to be avenged for all their
wrongs. Unfortunately the wooden-bridge, by the weight of
the artillery, was wedged so fast into the floncs and mud, that
it was impossible to remove it. Dismayed at this accident, the
Spaniards advanced with precipitation towards the second
breach. The Mexicans hemmed them in on every fide, and
though they defended themselves with their usual courage, yet
crouded together as they were on a narrow cauftiway, their dif
cipline and military fiill were of little avail, nor did the obfcu-
rity of the night permit them to derive great advantage from
their fire-arms, or the superiority of their other weapons. All

B 0 0 K Mexico was now in arms, and so eager were the people on the de-

-_-. - . truaion of their oppressors, that they who were not near enough
'520. to annoy them in person, impatient of the delay, pressed forward

'ith such ardour, as drove on their countrymen in the front with
ir-refiible violence. Fresh warriors instantly filled the place of
filch as fell. The Spaniards, weary with slaughter, and un-
able to fuflain the weight of the torrent that poured in upon
them, began to give way. In a moment the confusion was
universal; horse and foot, officers and soldiers, friends and
enemies, were mingled together; and while all fought, and
many fell, they could hardly diftinguilh from what hand the
blow came.

Their dif- C')RTES, wich about a hundred foot soldiers and a few horse,
alters, forced his way over the two remaining breaches in the cause-

way, the bodies of the dead serving to fill up the chasms, and
reached the main land. Having formed them as oon as they
arrived, he returned with such as were yet capable of service,
to aflift his friends in their retreat, and to encourage them, by
his pretence and example, to persevere in the efforts requisite
to effet it. He met with part of his soldiers, who had broke
through the enemy, but found many more overwhelmed by
the multitude of their aggressors, or perishing in the lake; and
heard the piteous lamentations of others, whom the Mexicans,
having taken alive, were carrying off in triumph to be facri-
siced to the god of war. Before day, all who had escaped as-
fembled at Tacuba. But when.the morning dawned, and dif-
covered to the view of Cortes his hattered battalion, reduced to
lels than half its number, the survivors dejected, and molt of
them covered with wounds, the thoughts of what they had
suffered, and the remembrance of so many faithful friends and

gallant followers who had fallen in that night of sorrow ", B K
pierced his foul with such anguish, that while he was forming --.---
their ranks, and issuing ome aeceffary orders, his soldiers ob- 5
served the tears trickling from his eyes, and remarked, with
much fatisfaaion, that while attentive to the duties of a gene-
ral, he was not insensible to. the feelings of a man..

IN this fatal retreat many officers of diflinCion perished 3 an loss.

and among these Velasquez de Leon, who having forsaken the
party of his kinsman, the governor of Cuba, to follow the for-
tune of his companions, was, on that account, as well as for
his superior merit, refpeaed by them as the second person in
the army. All' the artillery, ammunition, and baggage, were
loft; the greater part of the horses, and above two thousand;
Tlafcalans, were killed, and' only a very finall portion of the-
treasure which they had amafled was saved. This, which hadf
been always their chief objec, proved now a great cause of their
calamity; for many of the soldiers having so overloaded them-
selves with bars of gold as rendered them unfit for action, an&
retarded their flight, fell, ignominiouffy, the vidims of their
own inconsiderate avarice. Amidst so many difalters, it was.

_.- --' wards the rising ground, and having fortunately discovered a

temple situated on an eminence, took possession of it. There
he found not only the shelter for which he wished, but, what
was no less wanted, ome provisions to refreif his men; and
though the enemy did not intermit their attacks throughout the
day, they were with little difficulty prevented lIom making any
impreflion. During this time Cortes was engaged in deep con-
fultation with his officers, concerning the route which they
ought to take in their retreat. They were now on the weft
fide of the lake. Tlafcala, the only place where they could
hope for a friendly reception, lay about fixty-four miles to the
east of Mexico c; so that they were obliged to go round the
north end of the 1lake before they could fall into the road which
led thither. A Tlafcalan soldier undertook to be their guide,
and conduced them through a country in some places marshy,
in others mountainous, in all ill-cultivated and thinly peopled.
They marched for fix days with little respite, and under con-
tinual alarms, numerous bodies of the Mexicans hovering around
them, sometimes harassing them at a distance with their mif-
file weapons, and ometimes attacking them closely in front, in
rear, in flank, with great boldness, as they now knew that they
were not invincible. Nor were the fatigue and danger of those
incessant confliCts the worfi evils to which they were exposed.
As the barren country through which they passed afforded hardly
any provisions, they were reduced to feed on berries, roots,
and the stalks of green maize; and at the very time that famine
was depressing their spirits and wafting their flrength, their
situation required the most vigorous and unremitting exertions
of courage and ativity. Amidst those complicated distresses,

one circumstance supported and animated the Spaniards. Their o0o K
commander sustained this fad rverfe of fortune with unshaken ,--,--
magnanimity. I-is presence of mind never forsook him; his j:3
sagacity foresaw every event, and his vigilance provided for it.
He was foremofi: in every danger, and endured every hardfip
with checrfulncfs. The difficulties with which he was fur-
rounded seemed to call forth new talents; and his soldiers,
though despairing thermelves, continued to follow him with
increasing confidence in his abilities.

ON the sixth day they reached Otumba, not far from the road Battle of O

between Mexico and Tlafcala. Early next morning they be-uba
gan to advance towards it, flying parties of the enemy still
hanging on their rear; and amidst the insults with which they
accompanied their hostilities, Marina remarked that they often
exclaimed with exultation, " Go on, robbers; go to the place
where you fllall quickly meet the vengeance due to your
crimes." The meaning of this threat the Spaniards did not com-
prehend, until they reached the summit of an eminence before
them. There a spacious valley opened to their view, covered
with a vast army, extending as far as the eye could reach.
The Mexicans, while with one body of their troops they ha-
rafled the Spaniards in their retreat, had afninllcd their prin-
cipal force on the other fide of the lake ; and nmarching; along
the road which led dirc.lly to Tlafcala, postcd it in the phlin

tl20' ttlde. Such, however, was the superiority of the Spanish difci-

pline and arms, that the impreflion of this small body was irre-
fiftible; and whichever way its force was directed, it penetrated
and dispersed the moit numerous battalions. But while these
gave way in one quarter, new combatants advanced from an-
other, and the Spaniards, though successful in every attack,
were ready to fink under those repeated efforts, without feeing
any end of their toil, or any hope of victory. At that time
Cortes observed the great tfandard of the empire, which was
carried before the Mexican general, advancing; and fortunately
recollecting to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the
event of every battle, he assembled a few of his bravest officers,
whose horses were still capable of service, and placing himself
at their head, pushed forward towards the standard with an
impetuosity which bore down every thing before it. A chosen
body of nobles, who guarded the fandard, made ome resist-
ance, but were oon broken. Cortes, with a firoke of is
lance, wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the
ground. One of his followers alighting, put an end to his life,
and laid hold of the imperial standard. The moment that their
leader fell, and the standard, towards which all direced their
eyes, disappeared, an universal panic firuck the Mexicans, and,
as if the bond which held them together had been dissolved,
every ensign was lowered, each soldier threw away his wea-
pons, and all fled with precipitation to the mountains. The
Spaniards, unable to pursue them far, returned to collec the
spoils of the field, which were o valuable as to be some com-
penfation for the wealth which they had loft in Mexico; for in
the enemy's army were most of their principal warriors, drefled

I zo.
the Tlafcalan territories d.July .

Bur, amidst their fatisfation in having got beyond the pre- Reception of

cinds of an hostile country, they could not look forward with- jn, TlSlac a!
out solicitude, as they were still uncertain what reception they
might meet with from allies, to whom they returned in a con-
dition very different from that in which they had lately set out
from their dominions. Happily for them, the enmity of tile
Tlafcalans to the Mexican name wxas to inveterate, their desire
to avenge the death of their countrymen ib vehement, and
the ascendant which Cortes had acquired over the.chiefs of the
republic so complete, that, far from entertaining a thought of
taking any advantage of the distressed situation in which they
beheld the Spaniards, they.reccived them with a tenderness and
cordiality which quickly diflipated all their suspicions.

SOME interval of tranquillity and indulgence was now abfo- New dlite-

lutely necessary; not only that the Spaniards might give atten- Cortes.
tion to the cure of their wounds, which had been too long
neglected, but in order to recruit their strength, exhausted by
such a long succession of fatigue and hardflips. During this,
Cortes learned that he and his companions were not the only
Spaniards who had felt the effects of the Mexican enmity. A
considerable detachment, which was marching from Zempoalla
towards the capital, had been cut off by the people of Tepeaca.

5210. the life of every Spaniard was of importance, such losses were

deeply felt. The schemes which Cortes was meditating ren-
dered them peculiarly afflicive to him. While his enemies,
and even many of his own followers, confidered the disasters
which had befallen him as fatal to the progress of his arms,
and imagined that nothing now remained but speedily to
abandon a country which he had invaded with unequal force,
his mind, as eminent for perseverance as for enterprise, was
flill bent on acconplilhing his original purpofLe, of subject-
ing the Mexican empire to the crown of Caflile. Severe and
unexpeced as the check was which he had received, it did
not appear to hll a sufficient reason for relinquishing the con-
quests which he had already made, or against resuming his
operations with better hopes of success. The colony at Vera
Cruz was not only safe, but had remained unmolefled. The
people of Zempoalla and the adjacent difirits had discovered
no symptoms of defection. The Tlafcalans continued faithful
to their alliance. On their martial spirit, easily rouzed to
arms, and inflamed with implacable hatred of the Mlexicans,
he depended for powerful aid. He had fill the command of
a body of Spaniards, equal in number to that with which he
had opened his way into the centre of the empire, and had
taken pfl'effion of the capital; so that witl the benefit of
greater experience, as well as more pcrfcd& knowicdge of the
country, lie did not despair of quickly recovering all that he
had been deprived of by untoward events.

rather than soldiers, and had accompanied him to New Spain

tion to engage in the hardlhips and dangers of war. As the
fame motives had induced them to enter into their new engage-

'q-v - they, in a body, offered a remonstrance to their general a.gainst

the imprudence of attacking a powerful empire with his hattered
forces, and formally required him to lead them back direOtly
to Cuba. Though Cortes, long praififed in the arts of com-
mand, employed arguments, entreaties, and presents, to con-
vince or to ooth them; though his own soldiers, animated with
the spirit of their leader, warmly seconded his endeavours; he
found their fears too violent and deep-rooted to be removed,
and. the utmost he could effe&L was to prevail with them to defer
their.depart.ure for some time, on a promise that he would, at
a more proper juncture, difinifs such as should defre it.

Means he THAT the malcontents might have no leisure to brood over
employs to
revive thtr the causes of their difaffedion, he resolved inflantly to call
confidence. forth his troops into action. He proposed to chastise the people

of Tepeaca for the outrage which they had committed, and as
the detachment which they had cut off happened to be com-
posed mostly of soldiers who had served under Narvaez, their
companions, from the desire of vengeance, engaged more wil-
Augul. lingly in this war. He took the command in person, accom-

panied by a numerous body of Tlafcalans, and in the space of
a few weeks, after various encounters, with great slaughter of
the Tepeacans, reduced that province to fubjedion. During
several months, while he waited for the supplies of men and
ammunition which he expected, and was carrying on.his pre-
parations for conftruting the brigantines, he kept his troops
conflantly employed in various expeditions against the adjacent
provinces, all of which were conducted with an uniform tenor
of success. By these, his men became again accustomed to vic-
tory, and refuned their wonted sense of superiority; the Mex-

chiefs of the republic delighted to fee their country enriched 1sZC.

every day with fresh discoveries of the irresistible prowess of
their allies, declined no effort requisite to support them.

ALL those preparatory arrangements, however, though the Strengthened

lowed him to make, would have been of little avail, without a
reinforcement of Spanish soldiers. Of this he was so deeply
sensible, that it was the chief object of his thoughts and wiihes;
and yet his only profped of obtaining it from the return of the
officer whom he had sent to the isles to solicit aid, was both
diflant and uncertain. But what neither his own sagacity nor
power could have procured, he owed to a series of fortunate
and unforeseen incidents. The governor of Cuba, to whom the
success of Narvaez appeared an event of infallible certainty,
having ent two small ships after him with new inftrucions
and a supply of men and military flores, the officer whom
Cortes had appointed to command on the coast, artfully decoy-
ed them into the harbour of Vera Cruz, seized the vessels, and
easily persuaded the soldiers to follow the standard of a more
able leader than him whom they were dcftined to join '. Soon
after, three fiips of more considerable force came into the har-
bour separately. These belonged to an armament fitted out by
Francisco de Garay, governor of Jamaica, who, being possessed
with the rage of discovery and conqcueft which animated every
Spaniard fettled in America, had long aimed at intruding into

vinces, where the country was poor and the people fierce and

proof againtf the splendid hopes and promises which had fe-
dueed other adventurers, and as if the spirit of revolt had been
contagious in New Spain, they likewise abandoned the mailer
whom they were bound to serve, and inlifted under Cortes .
Nor was it America alone that furnished such unexpected aid.
A hip arrived from Spain, freighted by some private merchants
with military flores, in hopes of a profitable market in a coun-
try, the fame of whose opulence began to spread over Europe.
Cortes eagerly purchased a cargo which to him was invaluable,
and the crew, following the general example, joined him at

FROM those various quarters, the army of Cortes was aug-

mented with an hundred and eighty men, and twenty horses,
a reinforcement too inconsiderable to produce any consequence
which would entitle it to have been mentioned in the history
of other parts of the globe. But in that of America, where
great revolutions were brought about by causes which seemed
to bear no proportion to their effects, fucl finall events rife
into importance, bccaufe they were sufficient to decide with
rcfpeal to the fate of kingdoms. Nor is it the least remarkable

usual weapons of war, he gave diretion to make long spears

every province of the empire to take arms againtf their oppref-

he promised them exemption from all the taxes which his prede-
ceffors had imposed '. But what he laboured with the greatest
earnestness was, to deprive the Spaniards of the advantages which
they derived from the friendflip of the Tlafcalans, by endea4'
vouring to persuade that people to renounce all connetion with
men who were not only avowed enemies of the gods whom they
worshipped, but who would not fail to subjea them at last to
the fame yoke, which they were now inconsiderately lending

In his stead the Mexicans raised to the throne Guatimozin,

high reputation for abilities and valour, that in this dangerous
crisis, his countrymen, with one voice, called him to the fu-

troops forced their way with little difficulty, and took poleflion C'Or' MCx-
of Tezeuco, the second city of the empire, situated on the
banks of the lake about twenty miles from Mexico °. Here
he determined to eflablifil his head-quarters, as the most pro-
per station for launching his brigantines, as well as for making
his approaches to the capital. In order to render his residence
there more secure, he deposed the cazique or chief, who was at
the' head of that community, under pretext of some defect in
his title, and substituted in his place a person whom a faction of
the nobles pointed out as the right heir of that dignity. At-
tached to him by this benefit, the new cazique and his adhe-
rents served the Spaniards with inviolable fidelity'.

ILZ* well prepared for defence, and in a situation of such peculiar

flrcngth, mufl have exposcd his troops to inevitable deftruc-
tion. Three months elapsed before the materials for construct-
ing the brigantines were finifled, and before he heard any
thing with refpe& to the success of his negociation in His-
paniola. This, however, was not a season of ination to
Cortes. He attacked fiuccffively several of the towns situated
around the lake, and though all the Mexican power was ex-
erted to obftrud his operations, he either compelled them to
fubmit'to the Spanish crown, or reduced them to ruins. Other
towns he endeavoired to conciliate by more gentle means, and
though he could not hold any intercourse with the inhabitants
but by the intervention of interpreters, yet, under all the dif-
advantage of that tedious and imperfect mode of communica-
tion, he had acquired such thorough knowledge of the state of
the country, as well as of the dispositions of the people, that
he conduaed his negociations and intrigues with astonishing
dexterity and success. Most of the cities adjacent to Mexico were
originally the capitals of finall independent flates; and some of
them having been but lately annexed to the Mexican empire,
fill retained the remembrance of their ancient liberty, and bore
with impatience the rigorous yoke of their new maflers.
Cortes having early observed symptoms of their difaffedion,
availed himself of this knowledge to gain their confidence and
fiicndflip. By offering, with confidence, to deliver them from
the odious dominion of the Mexicans, and by liberal promises
of more indulgent treatment, if they would unite with him,
against their opprelfors, he prevailed on the people of fcveral
confidecrable dilrid's not only to acknowledge the king ofCaflile

a~
Io0

as their overeign, but to fipply the Spanish camp with pro- B 0 lK
visions, and to firengthen his army with auxiliary troops. I_,_
Guatimozin, on the first appearance of defection among his '"'
fubjedts, exerted himself with vigour to prevent or to punish
their revolt; but in spite of his efforts, the spirit continued to
spread, The Spaniards gradually acquired new allies, and with
deep concern he beheld Cortes arming against his empire those
very hands which ought to have been active in its defence;
and ready to advance against the capital at the head of a nume-
rous body of his own fubjeds .

WHILE, by those various methods, Cortes was gradually

circumscribing the Mexican power, within such narrow limits
that his profped of overturning it seemed neither to be uncer-
tain nor remote, all his schemes were well nigh defeated, by a
conspiracy no less unexpected than dangerous. The soldiers of
Narvaez had never united perfectly with the original compa-
nions of Cortes, nor did they enter into his measures with the
fame cordial zeal. Upon every occasion that required any ex-
traordinary effort of courage or of patience, their spirits were
apt to fink; and now, on a near view of what they had to en-
counter, in attempting to reduce a city so inacceflible as Mexico,
and defended y a numerous army, the resolution even of
those among them who had adhered to Cortes when he was
deserted by their associates, began to fail. Their fears led
them to presumptuous and unfioldier-like diifullions concerning
the propriety of their general's meafuircs, anl the improbability
of their success. From there they proceeded to censure and
invectives, and at last began to deliberate how they might pro-

c 0 0 K vide for their own safety, of which they deemed their com-
- ---. Imander to be totally negligent. Antonio Villefagna, a private
152 . soldier, but bold, intriguing, and strongly attached to Velasquez,

artfully fomented this growing spirit of difaffedion. His quar-
ters became the rendezvous of the malcontents, where, after
many consultations, they could discover no method of checking
Cortes in his career, but by assassinating him and his mofi con-
fiderable officers, and conferring the command upon some per-
son who would relinquish his wild plans, and adopt measures
more consistent with the general security. Despair inspired them
with courage. The hour for perpetrating the crime, the per-
sons whom they destined as victims, the officers to succeed
them in command, were all named; and the conspirators signed
an afrociation, by which they bound themselves with most so-
lemn oaths to mutual fidelity. But on the evening before the
appointed day, one of Cortes's ancient followers, who'had
been seduced into the conspiracy, touched with compunction
at the imminent danger of a man whom he had long been
accustomed to revere, or itruck with horror at his own
treachery, went privately to his general, and revealed to him
all that he knew. Cortes, though deeply alarmed, discerned at
once what conduct was proper in a situation so critical. He
repaired instantly to Villefagna's quarters, accompanied by
some of his most trufly officers. The aftonifhnent and con-
fusion of the man at this unexpected visit anticipated the con-
session of his guilt. While his attendants seized him, Cortes
snatched fiom his bosom a paper containing the arociation,
signed by the conspirators. Impatient to know how far the de-
feetion extended, he retired to read it, and found there names
which filled him with surprise and sorrow. But, aware how
dangerous a ftriat scrutiny might prove at such a jun&ure, he

confined

confined his judicial inquiries to Villefagna alone. As the B 0 0 K

V.

proofs of his guilt were manifest, he was condemned after a v
ihort trial, and next morning he was seen hanging before the 1521'
door of the house in which he had lodged. Cortes called his
troops together, and having explained to them the atrocious
purpose of the conspirators, as well as the justice of the punilh-
ment inflicRed on Villefagna, he added, with an appearance of
fatisfation, that he was entirely ignorant with refpet to all
the circuinflances of this dark tranfadion, as the traitor, when
arrefied, had suddenly torn and swallowed a paper, which pro-
bably contained an account of it, and under the severest tor-
tures possesld such constancy as to conceal the names of his
accomplices. This artful declaration reflored tranquillity to
many a brcaft that was throbbing, while he spoke, with con-
fcioufnefs of guilt and dread of detecion; and by this prudent
moderation, Cortes had the advantage of having discovered
and of being able to observe such of his followers as were dif-
affeCted; while they, flattering themselves that their pafl crime
was unknown, endeavoured to avert any suspicion of it, by re-
doubling their activity and zeal in his service r.

CORTES did not allow them leisure to ruminate on what had: i-:s singular
happened; and as the most effectual means of preventing the preparations

for building

return of a mutinous spirit, he determined to call forth his brigantines..
troops immediately to aion. Fortunately, a proper occasion
for this occurred without his eeming to court it. He received
intelligence, that the materials for building the brigantines were
at length completely finised, and waited only for a body of.
Spaniards to conduct them to Tezeuco. The command of this.

occasion, was growing daily in his confidence, and in the efli-

than important ; the beams, the planks, the mails, the cordage,
the fails, the iron-work, and all the infinite variety of articles
rcquifite for the conftrudion of thirteen brigantines, were to
be carried sixty miles over land, through a mountainous coun-
try, by people who were unacquainted with the ministry of
domestic animals, or the aid of machines to facilitate any work
of labour. The Tlafcalans furnished eight thousand Tamenes,
an inferior order of men destined for servile tasks, to carry the
materials on their shoulders, and appointed fifteen thousand
warriors to accompany and defend them. Sandoval made the
disposition for their progress with great propriety, placing the
Tamenes in the centre, one body of warriors i the front,
another in the rear, with considerable parties to cover the flanks.
To each of thee he joined ome Spaniards, not only to assist
them in danger, but to aceuftom them to regularity and sub-
ordination. A body so numerous, and so much encumbered,
advanced leisurely, but in excellent order; and in some places,
where it was confined by the woods or mountains, the line of
march extended above fix miles. Parties of Mexicans frequently
:appeared hovering around them on the high grounds; but per-
ceiving no profped of success in attacking an enemy continually
on his guard, and prepared to receive them, they did not ven-
ture to molest him; and Sandoval had the glory of conducting
safely to Tezeuco a convoy on which all the future operations
of his countrymen depended '.

litate this, he had employed a vast number of Indians for two
months in deepening the small rivulet which runs by Tezeuco
into the lake, and in forming it into a canal near two miles in
length '; and though the Mexicans, aware of his intentions, as
well as of the danger which threatened them, endeavoured fre-
quently to interrupt the labourers, or to burn the brigantines,
the work was at last completed . On the twenty-eighth of April, The brigan-

with wonder and hope, until they entered the lake, when they
hoisted their fails, and bore away before the wind. A general

quarters; from Tezeuco on the eafl fide of the lake, from Ta-

towns were situated on the principal causeways which led to the
capital, and intended for their defence. He appointed Sandoval
to command in the first, Pedro de Alvarado in the second, and
Chrifioval de Olid in the third; allotting to each a numerous
body of Indian auxiliaries, together with an equal division of

and dreaded. Though the brigantines, after all the labour
and merit of Cortes in forming them, were of inconfider-
able bulk, rudely conftruded, and manned chiefly with land-
men, hardly pofleffed of kill enough to conduct them, they
must have been objefts of terror to a people unacquainted
with any navigation but that of their lake, and pofeffed of no
vessel larger than a canoe. Necessity, however, urged Guati-
mozin to hazard the attack; and hoping to supply by numbers
what he wanted in force, he aflembled fucl a multitude of
canoes as covered the face of the lake. They rowed on boldly to
the charge, while the brigantines, retarded by a dead calm, could
scarcely advance to meet them. But as the enemy drew near, Repu!re.
a breeze suddenly sprung up; in a moment the fails were
spread, and the brigantines, with irrefiflible impetuosity, broke
through their feeble opponents, overset many canoes, and dif-
fipated the whole armament with such slaughter, as convinced
the Mexicans, that the progress of the Europeans in knowledge
and arts rendered their superiority greater on this new clement
than they had hitherto found it by land ".

He formed the brigantines in three divisions, allotting one to
each flation, with orders to second the operations of the officer
who commanded there. From all the three flations he puihed
on the attack against the city with equal vigour; but in a man-
ner so very different from that whereby sieges are conducted ins-
regular war, that he himself seems afraid that it would appear
no less improper than singular, to persons unacquainted with
his situation . Each morning his troops assaulted the barri-
cades which theenemy had ereced on the causeways, forced
their way over the trenches which they had dug, and through
the canals where the bridges were broken down, and endea-
voured to penetrate into the heart of the city, in hopes of ob-
taining ome decisive advantage, which might force the enemy
to urrender, and terminate the war at once; but when the
obstinate valour of the Mexicans rendered the efforts of the day
ineffectual, the Spaniards retired in the evening to their former
quarters. Thus their toil and danger were, in some measure,
continually renewed; the Mexicans repairing in the night what
the Spaniards had destroyed through the day, and recovering
the posts from which they had driven them. But necessity
prescribed this flow and untoward mode of operation. The
number of his troops was so fnall, that Cortes durst not, with
a handful of men, attempt to make a lodgment in a city where
he might be surrounded and annoyed by such a multitude of
enemies. The remembrance of what he had already suffered
by the ill-judged confidence with which he had ventured into

Spaniards, exhausted with fatigue, were unable to guard the _
various polts which they.daily gained; and though their camp ';1
was filled with Indian auxiliaries, they durlt not devolve this
charge upon them, because they were so little accuflomed to
discipline, that no confidence could be placed in their vigilance.
Besides this, Cortes was extremely solicitous to preserve the city
as much as pofible from being destroyed, both as he destined it
to be the capital of his conquests, and willed that it might re-
main as a monument of his glory. From all these confidera-
tions, he adhered obtlinately, for a month after the siege was
opened, to the system which he had adopted. The Mexicans, in
their own defence, displayed valour which was hardly inferior
to that with which the Spaniards attacked them. On land, on
water, by night and by day, one furious conflict succeeded to
another. Several Spaniards were killed, more wounded, and
all were ready to fink under the toils of unintermitting service,
which were rendered more intolerable by the injuries of the
season, the periodical rains being now set. in with their usual

ASTONISHED and disconcerted with the length and difficul- Endeavours

to take the

he had hitherto followed, and had recourse to any other mode
of attack. With this view, he ent inRftrutions to Alvarado
and Sandoval to advance with their divisions to a general assault,
and took the command in person of that poRed on the causeway
of Cuyocan. Animated by his presence, and the expectation July 3.

'52I' entered the city, gained ground incessantly, in spite of the mul-

titude and ferocity of their opponents. Cortes, though de-
lighted with the rapidity of his progress, did not forget that he
might still find it necessary to retreat; and in order to secure it,
appointed Julian de Alderete, a captain of chief note in the
troops which he had received from Hispaniola, to fill up the
canals and gaps in the causeway as the main body advanced.
That officer, deeming it inglorious to be thus employed, while
his companions were in the heat of aion and the career of
vicory, negleced the important charge committed to him, and
hurried on inconsiderately to mingle with the combatants. The
Mexicans, whose military attention and skill were daily im-
proving, no sooner observed this, than they carried an account
of it to their monarch.
Repuifed GUATIMOZIN instantly discerned the consequences of the

error which the Spaniards had committed, and, with admir-
able presence of mind, prepared to take advantage of it.
He commanded the troops ported in the front to flacken their
efforts, in order to allure the Spaniards to push forward, while
he dispatched a large body of chosen warriors through different
fireets, ome by land, and others by water, towards the great
breach in the causeway, which had been left open. On a fig-
nal which he gave, the priests in the principal temple firuck
the great drum consecrated to the god of war. No sooner did
the Mexicans hear its doleful solemn found, calculated to in-
spire them with contempt of death and enthufiatfic ardour, than
they rullied upon the encmy with frantic rage. ' he Spaniards,
unable to rfil men urged on no less by religious fury than

impatience to escape increased, the terror and confusion became 5,
so general, that when they arrived at the gap in the causeway,
Spaniards and Tlafcalans, horsemen and infantry, plunged in
promiscuously, while the Mexicans ruffed upon them fiercely
from every fide, their light canoes carrying them through shoals
which the brigantines could not approach. In vain did Cortes
attempt to flop and rally his flying troops; fear rendered them
regardless of his entreaties or commands. Finding all his en-

that which they fill bewailed. As the Spaniards pushed for-

them. As oon as they got possession of any part of the town,
the houfcs were instantly levelled with the ground. Day by
day, the Mexicans, forced to retire as their enemies gained
ground, were hemmed in within more narrow limits. Guati-
mozin, though uable to flop the career of the enemy, conti-
nued to defend his capital with obfinate resolution, and dif-
puted every inch of ground. But the Spaniards, having not
only varied their mode of attack, but, by orders of Cortes,
having changed the weapons with which they fought, were
again armed with the long Chinantlan spears, which they had
employed with such success against Narvaez, and, by the firm
array in which this enabled them to range themselves, they
repelled, with little danger, the loose assault of the Mexicans:
incredible numbers of them fell in the conflias which they
renewed every day . While war wafted without, famine be-

avenues to the city by land. The flores which Guatimozin had

attacked it from their new station with superior advantage, and

solicitous to save the life of a monarch whom they revered, pre-
vailed on Guatimozin to retire from a place where refitance was
now vain, that he might rouse the more diflant provinces of the
empire to arms, and maintain there a more successful struggle
with the public enemy. In order to facilitate the execution of
this measure, they endeavoured to amuse Cortes with overtures

him with cries and tears to forbear, as the emperor was there.
Holguin eagerly seized his prize, and Guatimozin, with a dig-
nified composure, gave himself up into his hands, requefling
only that no insult might be offered to the empress or his chil-
dren. When conduted to Cortes, he appeared neither with
the fullen fierceness of a barbarian, nor with the dejection of a
supplicant. " I have done," aid he, addressing himself to the
Spanish general, " what became a monarch. I have defended

which passed without some extraordinary effort of one party in B o0 K
the attack, or of the other in the defence of a city, on the fate of -.--
which both knew that the fortune of the empire depended. As ,5s'
the struggle here was more obflinate, it was likewise more equal
than any between the inhabitants of the Old and New W\orlds.
The great abilities of Guatimozin, the number of his troops,
the peculiar situation of his capital, so far counterbalanced the
superiority of the Spaniards in arms and discipline, that they
must have relinquished the enterprise, if they had trufled for
success to themselves alone. IBut Mexico was overturned
by the jealousy of neighbours who dreaded its power, and
by the revolt of fubjeds impatient to fllake off its yoke. By
their effectual aid, Cortes was enabled to accomplifl what,
without such fuipport, he would hardly have ventured to at-
tempt. How much soever this account of the reduction of
Mexico may detrad, on the one hand, from the marvellous
relations of some Spanifll writers, by ascribing that to simple
and obvious causes which they attribute to the romantic valour
of their countrymen, it adds, on the other, to the merit and
abilities of Cortes, who, under every disadvantage, acquir-
ed such an ascendant over unknown nations, as to render
them instruments towards carrying his schemes into exccu-
tion '.

Guatimozin, aware of his impending fate, had ordered what
remained of the riches amassed by his ancestors to be thrown
into the lake. The Indian auxiliaries, while the Spaniards
were engaged in conflit with the enemy, had carried off the
most valuable part of the spoil. The fum to be divided among
the conquerors was so finall, that many of them disdained to

mured and exclaimed; ome, against Cortes and his confidents,
whom they fufpeLed of having secretly appropriated to their

services, with the boldness natural to a high-fpirited soldier.
But, for fomc reason which is not explained, both his general
and his sovereign rejected his suit with a disdainful coldness,
that was intolerable to a man conscious of what he had done,
and of what he deservcd. In a transport of resentment, he
formally renounced his allegiance to an ungrateful mafler, and
151'7 fled to the court of CafPile, in hopes that there his worth would

be more jufily eflimatcd. He endeavoured to recommend him-
self by proposing to execute a fcheie, the accomplishment of
which, he knew, would wound the monarch against whom he
was exasperated in the most tender part. He revived Colum-
bus's original and favourite project, of discovering a paflage to
India by a westerly course, and without encroaching on that
portion of the globe which was allotted to the Portuguese by
the line of demarcation. He founded his hopes of success on
the ideas of that great navigator, confirmed by many obferva-
tions, the result of his own naval experience, as well as that of
his countrymen, in their intercourse with the East. The un-
dertaking, he acknowledged, was both arduous and expensive,
as it could not be attempted but with a squadron of considerable
force, and victualled for at leait two years. Fortunately, he
applied to a minister who was not apt to be deterred, either by

according to the ideas of the age, were deemed to be of

amounted to two hundred and thirty-four men, among whom
were ome of the most skilful pilots in Spain, and fevcral Por-

Canaries, he flood directly south towards the equinoaial line

the shallowness of the fiream and the freshness of the water, that
the wifled-for itrait was not situated there, and continued his
course towards the south. On the thirty-firfl of March he ar-

desperate adventurer, and returning directly to Spain. This
dangerous insurrection Magellan suppressed, by an effort of
courage no less prompt than intrepid, and inflicted exemplary
punishment on the ringleaders. With the remainder of his
followers, overawed but not reconciled to his scheme, he con-
tinued his voyage towards the south, and at length discovered,
near the fifty-third degree of latitude, the mouth of a firair,
into which he entered, notwithstanding the murmurs and re-
monstrances of the people under his command. After failing
twenty days in tat winding dangerous channel, to which he
gave his own name, and where one of his ships deserted
him, the great Southern Ocean opened to his view, and with
tears of joy he returned thanks to Heaven for having thus far
crowned his endeavours with success .

BUT he was frill at agreater distance than he imagined from

the objec of his withes. He failed during three months and
twenty days in an uniform direction towards the north-west,
without discovering land. In this voyage, the longest that had"
ever been made in the unbounded ocean, he suffered incredible
distress. His flock of provisions was almnot exllhuflcd, the

THOUGH an untimely fate deprived Magellan of the satis-

fadion of accomplishing this great undertaking, his contem-
poraries, just to his memory and talents, ascribed to him not
only the glory.of having formed the plan, but of having fur-
mounted almost every obfacle to the completion of it; and in
the present age hjs name is fiill ranked among the highest in the
roll of eminent and successful navigators. The naval glory of
Spain now eclipsed that of every other nation, and by a singular
felicity she had the merit, in the course of a few years, of dif-
covering a new continent almost as large as that part of the
earth which was formerly known, and of ascertaining by ex-
perience the form and extent of the whole terraqueous globe.

THE Spaniards were not satisfied with the glory of having

firfi encompassed the earth; they expected to derive great com-
mercial advantages from this new and boldest effort of their

that the spice islands, and several of the richest countries in the
East, were so situated as to belong of right to the crown of
Caflile, in consequence of the partition made by Alexander VI.
The merchants, without attending to this difcuflion, engaged
eagerly in that lucrative and alluring commerce, which was

now opened to them. The Portuguese, alarmed at the intru- B 00 I
sion of such formidable rivals, remonitrated and negociated in '--
Europe, while in Asia they obftruted the trade of the Spaniards 1521
by force of arms. Charles, not sufficiently inftruaed with rc-
fpeLc to the importance of this valuable branch of commerce,
or difftraed by the multiplicity of his schemes and operations,
did not afford his fubjeas proper protection. At lafl, the low
slate of his finances, exhausted by the efforts of his arms in
every part of Europe, together with the dread of adding a new
war with Portugal to those in which he was already engaged,
induced him to make over his claim of the Moluccas to the Por-
tuguefe for three hundred and fifty thousand ducats. He reserved,
however, to the crown of Castile the right of reviving its pre-
tensions on repayment of that um, but other objects engrossed
his attention and that of his successors; and Spain was finally
excluded from a branch of commerce in which it was engaging
with sanguine expectations of profit'.

THOUGH the trade with the Moluccas was relinquished,

the voyage of Magellan was followed by commercial effets of
great moment in Spain. Philip II. in the year one thousand
five hundred and fixty-four, reduced those islands which he
discovered in the Eastern Ocean to fubijcdion, and established
settlements there; between which and the kingdom of New
Spain, a regular intercourse, the nature of which flhall be ex-
plained in its proper place, is carried on. I return now to the
tranfadions in New Spain.

V. _,-.-- · commission or authority from the sovereign whom he was
'52'' serving with such successful zeal, but to be regarded as an un-

dutiful and seditious subject. By the influence of Fonseca,
bishop of Burgos, his conduc in assuming the government of
New Spain was declared to be an irregular usurpation, in con-'
tempt of the royal authority; and Chriftoval de Tapia received
a commission, impowering him to supersede Cortes, to seize his
person, to confiscate his effeds, to make a stria scrutiny into
his proceedings, and to transmit the result of his inquiries to
the council of the Indies, of which the bihop of Burgos was
president. A few weeks after the reducaion of Mexico, Ta-
pia landed at Vera Cruz with the royal mandate to strip its
conqueror of his power, and to treat him as a criminal. But
fonseca had chosen a very improper instrument to wreak his
vengeance on Cortes. Tapia had neither the reputation nor
the talents that suited the high command to which he was ap-

hich he pointed. Cortes, while he publickly expressed the most refpecd-
eludes. ful veneration for the emperor's authority, secretly took mea-

fures to defeat the effec of his commiflion; and having
involved Tapia and his followers in a multiplicity of negocia-
tions and conferences, in which he ometimes had recourse to
threats, but more frequently employed bribes and promises, he
at length prevailed on that weak man to abatdon a province
which he was unworthy of governing '.

with rich presents to the emperor, as the earnest of future con-
tributions from his new conquelt; requesting, in recompence
for all his services, the approbation of his proceedings, and
that he might be entrurfed with the government of those terri-
tories, which his conduct, and the valour of his followers had
added to the crown of Caflile. The juncture in which his de-
puties reached the court was favourable. The internal commo-
tions in Spain, which had disquieted the beginning of Charles's
reign, were just appeased. The ministers had leisure to turn
their attention towards foreign affairs. The account of Cortes's
vicories filled his countrymen with admiration. The extent
and value of his conquests became the object of vail and inte-
refling hopes. Whatever stain he might have contracted, by
the irregularity of the feps which he took in order to attain
power, was so fully effaced by the splendor and merit of the
great ations which this had enabled him to perform, that every
heart revolted at the thought of inflising any censure on a
man, whose services entitled him to the highest marks of dif-
tinsdion. The public voice declared warmly in favour of his
pretensions, and Charles arriving in Spain about this time,
adopted the fentimnents of his fubjecs with a youthful ardour.

by various arrangements, endeavoured to render his conquest a
secure and beneficial acquisition to his country. He determin-
ed to establish the feat of government in its ancient flation,
and to raise Mexico again from its ruins; and having conceived
high ideas concerning the future grandeur of the state of which
he was laying the foundation, he began to rebuild its capital
on a plan which hath gradually formed the molt magnificent
city in the New World. At the fame time, he employed fkil-
ful persons to search for mines in different parts of the coun-
try, and opened some which were found to be richer than any
which the Spaniards had hitherto discovered in America. He
detached his principal officers into the remote provinces, and
encouraged them to fettle there, not only by bellowing upon
them large trads of land, but by granting them the fame do-
minion over the Indians, and the fame right to their service,
which the Spaniards had assumed in the islands.

Tnfurreflions IT was not, however, without difficulty that the Mexi-
of the Mex-
icans, and can empire could be entirely reduced into the form of a Spanish
c'anlird ofthe colony. Enraged and rendered desperate by oppreflion, the

natives often forgot the superiority of their enemies, and run
to arms in defence of their liberties. In every contest, how-
ever, the European valour and discipline prevailed. But,

fatally for the honour of their country, the Spaniards sullied B 0 O K

V.

the glory redounding from these repeated victories by their i- _.
mode of treating the vanquished people. After taking Guati- 'izz'
mozin, and becoming mailers of his capital, they supposed that
the king of Castile entered on possession of all the rights of the
captive monarch, and affeaed to confider every effort of the
Mexicans to assert their own independence, as the rebellion of
vassals against their sovereign, or the mutiny of slaves against
their mailer. Under the fandion of those ill-founded maxims,
they violated every right that should be held sacred between
hotile nations. After every infurretion, they reduced the com-
mon people in the provinces which they subdued, to the molt hu-
miliating of all conditions, that of personal servitude. Their
chiefs, supposed to be more criminal, were punished with greater
severity, and put to death in the most ignominious or the most
excruciating form, that the insolence or the cruelty of their con-
querors could devise. In almost every province of the Mexican
empire, the progress of the Spanish arms is marked with blood,
and with deeds so atrocious as disgrace the enterprising valour
that conducted them to success. In the province of Panuco,
sixty caziques, or leaders, and four hundred nobles, were burnt
at one time. Nor was this shocking barbarity perpetrated in
any sudden ally of rage, or by a commander of inferior note.
It was the aCt of Sandoval, an officer whose nalne is entitled to
the second rank in the annals of New Spain, executed after a
solemn consultation with Cortes; and to complete the horror of
the scene, the children and relations of the wretched viclims
were afnembled, and compelled to be i'pctators of their dying
agonies Y. It fecms hardly poflible to xceed in horror this
dreadful example of severity, but it was followed by another,

B 0o 0K which affeced the Mexicans fiill more sensibly, as it gave

V.
----' them a most feeling proof of their own degradation, and of the
S22 minall regard that their haughty maflers retained for the ancient

dignity and splendour of their slate. On a flight suspicion, con-
firmed by very imperfect evidence, that Guatimozin had form-
ed a scheme to hake off the yoke, and to excite his former
subjects to take arms, Cortes, without the formality of a trial,
ordered the unhappy monarch, together with the caziques of
Tezeuco and Tacuba, the two persons of greatest eminence in
the empire, to be hanged; and the Mexicans, with astonish-
ment and horror, beheld this ignominious punishment inflicted
upon persons, to whom they were accustomed to look up
with reverences hardly inferior to that which they paid to the
gods themselves . The example of Cortes and his principal
officers, encouraged and justified persons of subordinate rank to
venture upon committing greater excesses. Nuno de Guzman,
in particular, stained an illustrious name by deeds of peculiar
enormity and rigor, in various expeditions which he con-
ducted '.

ONE circumfiance, however, saved the Mexicans from far-

ther consumption, perhaps from one as complete as that which
had depopulated the islands. The first conquerors did not at-
tempt to search for the precious metals in the bowels of the
earth. They were neither sufficiently wealthy to carry on the
expensive works, which are requisite for opening those deep
recesses where Nature has concealed the veins of gold and
silver, nor sufficiently skilful to perform the ingenious opera-
tions by which they are separated from their refpedive ores.

They were satisfied with the more simple method, pracifed by °0 0 K
the Indians, of waffing the earth carried down rivers and tor-
rents from the mountains, and collecting the grains of native
metal deposited there. The rich mines of New Spain, which
have poured forth their treasures with such profulion on every
quarter of the globe, were not discovered for several years after the 55Z, &-,
conquest b. By that time, a more orderly government and police
were introduced into the colony; experience, derived from former
errors, had suggested many useful and humane regulations for
the protecion and preservation of the Indians; and though it
then became necessary to increase the number of those employed
in the mines, and they were engaged in a species of labour
more pernicious to the human constitution, they suffered less
hardship or diminution than from the ill-judged, but less ex-
tensive, schemes of the firt conquerors.

THIS extraordinary mortality among the Indians, dif-

appointed the hopes of their new mafier. Few seem to have
derived any considerable wealth from their ill-conduced
researches. According to the usual fate of first settlers in new
colonies, it was their lot to encounter danger and to struggle
with difficulties; the fruits of their victories and toils were re-
served for times of tranquillity, and reaped by fucceflors of
greater industry, but of inferior nmerit. The early historians
of America abound with accounts of the fuffcrings and of the
poverty of its conqucrors . In New Spain, their condition
was rendered more grievous by a peculiar arrangement. When
Charles V. advanced Cortes to the government of that country,

a _--a- jurifdidion d. These men, chosen fronm inferior atiols in
i5 22 various departments of public business at Madrid, were so

much elevated with their promotion, that they thought they
were called to at a part of the first consequence. But being
accustomed to the minute formalities of office, and having con-
traded the narrow ideas suited to the sphere in which they had
15z4. hitherto moved, they were allonifhed, on arriving in Mexico,

at the high authority which Cortes exercised, and could not
conceive that the mode of adminiitration, in a country recently
subdued and fettled, must be different from that which took
place in one where tranquillity and regular government had
been long eitaliifhed. In their letters, they represented Cortes
as an ambitious tyrant, who having usurped ajurifdiEtion fupe-
rior to law, aspired at independence, and by his exorbitant
wealth and extensive influence, might accomplish those dif-
loyal chemes which he apparently meditated e. These infinu-
ations made such deep impreflion upon the Spanish minitfers,
moti of whom had been formed to business under the jealous
and rigid adminifiration of Ferdinand, that unmindful of all
Cortes's past services, and regardless of what he was then sus-
fering in conducting that extraordinary expedition, in which
he advanced from the lake of Mexico to the western extremi-
ties of Honduras ', they infued the fame suspicions into the
mind of their master, and prevailed on him to order a solemn
inquest to be made into his condua, with powers to the licen-
1525. ciate Ponce de Leon, entrusted with that commiflion, to seize

his person, if he ihould find that expedient, and fend him pri-

THE sudden death of Ponce de Leon, a few days after his B °0 K

arrival in New Spain, prevented the execution of this commis- ---
sion. But as the objet of his appointment was known, the IS5.
mind of Cortes was deeply wounded with this unexpected re-
turn for services which far exceeded whatever any fubje of
Spain had rendered to his sovereign. He endeavoured, how-
ever, to maintain his flation, and to recover the confidence of
the court. But every person in office, who had arrived from
Spain since the conquest, was a spy upon his conduct, and with
malicious ingenuity gave an unfavourable representation of all
his ations. The apprchenfions of Charles and his ministers
increased. A new commission of inquiry was issued, with more 1528,
extensive powers, and various precautions were taken to pre-
vent or to punish him, if he should be so presumptuous as to
attempt what was inconfifient with the fidelity of a subjea h.
Cortes beheld the approaching crisis of his fortune with all the
violent emotions natural to a haughty mind, conscious of high
desert, and receiving unworthy treatment. But though some
of his desperate followers urged him to assert his own rights
against his ungrateful country, and, with a bold hand, to seize
that power which the courtiers meanly accused him of coveting',
he retained such felf-command, or was actuated with such fen-
timents of loyalty, as to reject their dangerous counsels, and to
chufe the only course in which he could secure his own dignity,
without departing from his duty. He resolved not to expose
himself to the ignominy of a trial, in that country which hadi
been the scene of his triumphs; but, without waiting for the
arrival of his judges, to repair diretly to Castile, and commirt

CORTES appeared in his native country with the splendour

that suited the conqueror of a mighty kingdom. He brought
with him a great part of his wealth, many jewels and orna-
ments of great value, several curious productions of the coun-
try ', and was attended by some Mexicans of the first rank, as
well as by the molt considerable of his own officers. His ar-
rival in Spain removed at once every suspicion and fear that had
been entertained with refpet to his intentions. The emperor,
having now nothing to apprehend from the designs of Cortes,
received him like a person whom consciousness of his own
innocence had brought into the pretence of his mailer, and who
was intitled, by the eminence of his services, to the highest
marks of diftindion and refpe&. The order of St. Jago, the
title of Marquis del Valle de Guaxaca, the grant of a vast ter-
ritory in New Spain, were successively bellowed upon him;
and as his manners were correct and elegant, although he had
passed the greater part of his life among rough adventurers, the
emperor admitted him to the fame familiar intercourse with
himiflf, that was enjoyed by noblemen of the firfl rank .

BUT, amidst those external proofs of regard, symptoms of

remaining diftrufi appeared. Though Cortes earnestly solicited
to be reinltated in the government of New Spain, Charles, too
sagacious to commit such an important charge to a man whom
he had once fufpeaed, peremptorily refused to inveRt him again
with powers which he might find it impossible to controul.

Cortes, though dignified with new titles, returned to Mexico B 0o I
with diminished authority. The military department, with i
powers to attempt new discoveries, was left in his hands; but 1'33'
the supreme direcion of civil affairs was placed in a board called
The Audience of Netw Spain. At a subsequent period, when,
upon the increase of the colony, the exertion of authority more
united and extensive became necessary, Antonio de Mendoza,
a nobleman of high rank, was ent thither as Viceroy, to take
the government into his hands.

THis division of power in New Spain proved, as was un-

avoidable, the source of perpetual dissention, which embittered
the life of Cortes, and thwarted all his schemes. As he had
now no opportunity to display his aive talents but in attempt-
ing new discoveries, he formed various schemes for that purpose,
all of which bear impressions of a genius that delighted in what
was bold and splendid. He early entertained an idea, that,
either by fleering through the gulf of Florida along the east
coast of North America, ome itrait would be found that com-
municated with the weflern ocean; or that, by examining the
ifhmus of Darien, some passage would be discovered between
the North and South Seas". But having been disappointed in his
expecations with refped to both, he now confined his views to
such voyages of discovery as he could make from the ports of
New Spain in the South Sea. There he fitted out successively
fevcral finall squadrons, which cither perished in the attempt,
or returned without making any dilcovcry of moment. Cortes,
weary of enitrufling the condud of his operations to others,
took the coninand of a new armament in perlon, and, after ,;

B oo K enduring incredible hardships, and encountering dangers of
i.-~.~ every species, he discovered the large peninsula of California,

1536. and surveyed the greater part of the gulf which separates it

from New Spain. The discovery of a country of such extent
would have refleEted credit on a common adventurer; but it
could add little new honour to the name of Cortes, nor satisfy
the sanguine expectations which he had formed . Disgusted
with ill success, to which he had not been accustomed, and
weary of contesting with adversaries to whom he confidered it
3540. as a disgrace to be opposed, he once more fought for redress in

his native country.

B1T his reception there was very different from that which

gratitude, and even decency, ought to have secured for him.
The merit of his ancient exploits was already, in a great mea-
sure, forgotten, or eclipsed by the fame of recent and more
valuable conquests in another quarter of America. No service
of moment was now expected from a man of declining years,
and who began to be unfortunate. The emperor behaved to
him with cold civility; his ministers treated him, sometimes
with negleCt, sometimes with insolence. His grievances re-
ceived no redress; his claims were urged without effedc; and
after several years spent in fruitless application to miniflers and
judges, an occupation the most irksome and mortifying to a
man of high spirit, who had moved in a sphere where he was
more accustomed to command than to folicir, Cortcs ended his
days on the second of December one thousand five hundred and

difireffes to which they had been exposed, and the unpromising
asped of the places which they had visited. Damped by there

the east, as chimerical, they resolved to attempt the execution
of his scheme. The names of those extraordinary men were
Francisco Pizarro, Diego de Almagro, and Hernando Luque.
Pizarro was the natural on of a gentleman of an honourable
family by a very low woman, and, according to the cruel fate
which often attends the offspring of unlawful love, had been so
totally neglected in his youth by the author of his birth, that he
seems to have destined him never to rife beyond the condition of
his mother. In consequence of this ungenerous idea, he set him,

mind of young Pizarro disdaining that ignoble occupation, he B 0 l K
abruptly abandoned his charge, enlifled as a soldier, and after i_
serving ome years in Italy, embarked for America, which, by 1524.
opening such a boundlcfs range to aive talents, allured every
adventurer whose fortune was not equal to his ambitious
thoughts. There, Pizarro early diflinguiflhed himself. With
a temper of mind no less daring than the constitution of his
body was robust, he was foremost in every danger, patient
under the greatefl hardships, and unfubdued by any fatigue.
Though so illiterate that he could not even read, he was oon
confidered as a man formed to command. Every operation
committed to his conduct proved successful, as, by a happy but
rare conjunCtion, he united perseverance with ardour, and was
as cautious in executing, as he was bold in forming his plans.
By engaging early in aive life, without any resource but his
own talents and industry, and by depending on himself alone
in his firuggles to emerge from obscurity, he acquired such a
thorough knowledge of affairs, and of men, that he was fitted
to assume a superior part in conducting the one, and in govern-
ing the other .

ALMAGRO had as little to boast of his descent as Pizarro. The

one was a bastard, the other a foundling. Bred, like his com-
panion, in the camp, he yielded not to him in any of the fol-
dierly qualities of intrepid valour, indefatigable activity, or
insurmountable conflancy in enduring the hardships inseparable
from military service in the New World. But in Alniagro
there virtues were accompanied with the openness, generosity,

'5"4' dissimulation of a politician, with the art of concealing his own

purposes, and with sagacity to penetrate into those of other
men.

HERNANDO DE LUQUE was an ecclefiafiic, who aded both

as priest and schoolmaster at Panama, and, by means which
the contemporary writers have not described, had amafled riches
that inf)ired him with thoughts of rising to greater emi-

nence.

Terms of SUCH were the men defined to overturn one of the most ex-
their aocia- tensive empires on the face of the earth. Their confederacy for this

purpose was authorised by Pedrarias, the governor of Panama.
Each engaged to employ his whole fortune in the adventure.
Pizarro, the least wealthy of the three, as he could not throw
so large a fulm as his associates into the common stock, engaged
to take the departmentof greatest fatigue and danger, and to com-
mand in person the armamentwhichwas to go firfi upon discovery.
Almagro offered to conduct the supplies of provisions and rein-
forcements of troops, of which Pizarro might fland in need.
Luque was to remain at Panama to ncgociate with the gover-
nor, and filperintend whatever was carrying on for the gcneral
illtcrcfl. As the fl)irit of cnthultlafin uniformly accompanied
that cf aven)turc in tlhe New Woildl, and by that flrange union
botl acquired an incrcalf of force, this confederacy, formed by
ambition and avarice, was confirmed by the noft solemn at
of religion. Luquc cclclbratd mass, divided a consecratcd hofl

two to his afsociatcs, of which they partook; and thus, in name

of

bloodshed were the objeds d. i_-

THE attempt was begun with a force more fiited to the rrhi:rr::,t-

humble condition of the three adventurers, than to the greatness tC'"1'"
of the enterprise in which they were engaged. Pizarro fit fail Nov. 14.
from Panama with a tingle vefial, of small burden, and a hun-
dred and twelve men. But in that age, so little were the Spa-
niards acquainted with the peculiarities of climate in America,
that the time which Pizarro chose for his departure was the
most improper in the whole year; the periodical winds, which
were then 'et in, being directly adverse to the course which he
purposed to fleer . After beating about for seventy days, with
much danger and incessant fatigue, Pizarro's progress towards 1525.
the south-east was not greater than what a skilful navigator will
now make in as many hours. He touched at several places on
the coast of Tierra Firme, but found every where the fame un-
inviting country which former adventurers had described; the
low grounds converted into swamps by the overflowing of
rivers; the higher, covered with impervious woods; few in-

BUT Almagro having failed from that port with seventy men,

to meet with his associate. Not finding him there, he landed
his soldiers, who, in searching for their companions, underwent
the fame difireffes, and were exposed to the fame dangers, which
had driven them out of the country. Repulsed at length by
the Indians in a sharp conflit, in which their leader loft one
of his eyes by the wound of an arrow, they likewise were com-
pelled to reimbark. Chance led them to the place of Pizarro's
retreat, where they found tome consolation in recounting their
adventures, and comparing their fufl'erings. As Almagro had
Julle 24. advanced as far as the river St. Juan, in the province of Po-

payan, where both the country and inhabitants appeared with
a more promising apet, that dawn of better fortune was
Iufficient to determine such sanguine projectors not to abandon
their scheme, notwithstanding all that they had suffered in
prosecuting it .

They rcdrme ALMAIGRO repaired to Panama, in hopes of recruiting their
the underak-
hrng. i shattered troops. But what he and Pizarro had suffered, gave

his countrymen such an unfavourable idea of the service, that it
was with difficulty he could levy fourscore men . Feeble as this
rcinforcclent was, they did not hesitate about resuming their
operations. After a long series of dilafters and disappointments,
not inferior to those which they had already experienced, part
of the armament reached the Bay of St. Matthew, on the coall

of Quito, and landing at Tacamez, to the south of the river of B Y K
Emeraulds, they beheld a country more champaign and fertile
than any they had yet discovered in the Southern Ocean, the
natives clad in garments of woollen or cotton fluff, and adorned
with several trinkets of gold and silver.

BUT notwithstanding those favourable appearances, magni-

sied beyond the truth, both by the vanity of those who brought
the report fiom Tacamez, and by the fond imagination of
those who listened to them, Pizarro and Almagro durst not
venture to invade a country so populous with a handful of men,
enfeebled by fatigue and diseases. They retired to the finall
island of Gallo, where Pizarro remained with part of the troops,
and his afociate returned to Panama, in hopes of bringing
such a reinforcement, as might enable them to take poffefilon
of the opulent territories whose existence seemed to be no longer
doubtful .

Almagro met with an unfavourable reception from Pedro de los

settlement. After weighing the matter, with that cold oecono-
mical prudence, which appears the firfl of all virtues to per-
sons whose limited faculties are incapable of conceiving or exe-
cuting great dcfigns, he concluded an expedition, attended with
ifch certain wafle of men, to be so detrimental to an infant
and feeble colony, that he not only prohibited the raising of

though deeply affeced with these measures, which they could
not prevent and durfl not oppose, found means of communicat-
ing their sentiments privately to Pizarro, and exhorted him
not to relinquish an enterprise which was the foundation of all
their hopes, and the only means of re-establishing their repu-
tation and fortune, that were both on the decline. Pizarro's
mind, bent with inflexible obstinacy on all its purposes, needed
no incentive to perfifl in the scheme. lEe peremptorily re-
Pe f:ls ihis fused to obey the governor of Panama's orders, and employed

all his addrcfs and eloquence in persuading his men not to
abandon him, But the incredible calamities to which they
had been exposed were frill so recent in their memories, and
the thoughts of revisiting their families and friends after a
long absence, rushed with such joy into their minds, that when
Pizarro drew a line upon the sand with his sword, permitting
such as wifihed to return home to pass over it, only thirteen of
all the daring veterans in his service had resolution to remain
with their commander'.

THIS fiall, but determined band, whose names the Spanish

historians record with deserved praise, as the persons to whose
perlevering fortitude their country is indebted for the molt va-
luable of all its American possessions, fixed their refidcnce in
the illand of Gorgona. This, as it was farther removed from
the coalt than Gallo, and uninhabited, they confidered as a
more lecure retreat, where, unmolested, they might wait for
filpplics from Panama, which they truflcd that the aivity of

their associates there would be able to procure. Almagro and B , Kl
Luque were not inattentive or cold solicitors, and their inceflant -
importunity was seconded by the general voice of the colony,
which exclaimed loudly against the infamy of exposing
brave men, engaged in the public service, and chargeable
with no error but what flowed from an excess of zeal and
courage, to perish like the most odious criminals in a desert
island. Overcome by those intreaties and expoflulations, the
governor at last consented to fend a small veifel to their relief.
But that he might not seem to encourage Pizarro to any new
enterprise, he would not permit one land-man to embark on
board of it.

BY this time, Pizarro and his companions had remained EIHa'clips he

five months in an island, infamous for the mofl unhealthy
climate in that region of America k. During all this period,
their eyes and hopes were turned towards Panama, in hopes
of succour from their countrymen, but worn out at lengtl with
fruitless expectations, and dispirited with suffering hardffiips of
which they saw no end, they, in despair, came to a resolution of
committing themfelvcs to the ocean on a float, rather than con-
tinue in that detestable abode. But, on the arrival of the vcefel
from Panama, they were transportcd with such joy, that all
their sufferings were forgotten. Their hopes revived, and, with
a rapid transition, not unnatural among men accuflomcd by
their mode of life to sudden vicifitudes of fortune, hligl coin-
fidence succeeding to extreme dcjection, Pizarro cafily induced
them to resume their former scheme with fefl ardour. Infllca

beheld a country fully peopled, and cultivated with an ap-
pearance of regular induflry; the natives decently clothed,
and poffefied of ingenuity so far surpassing the other inha-
bitants of the New World, as to have the ife of tame

was fuich a show of gold and silver, not only in the orna-
ments of their persons and temples, but in several vessels
and utensils for common use, formed of the fame precious
metals, as left no room to doubt that they abounded with pro-
fusion in the country. Pizarro and his companions seemed

'5'8. jllting among theinfelves that Pizarro should claim the station

of Governor, Allnagro that of lieutenant-governor, and Lu-
'que the dignity of bishop in the country which they purposed
to conquer, they sent Pizarro as their agent to Spain, though
their fortunes were now so much exhausted by the repeated
efforts which they had made, that they found ome difficulty
in borrowing the small fum requisite towards equipping him
for the voyage ".

Pz: rro Ciit PIZAIRRO loft no time in repairing to court, and new as the

the unembarraffed dignity of a man, conscious of what his ser-
vices merited; and he conducted his negociations with an in-
linuating dexterity of address, which could not have been
cxpected either from his education, or former habits of life.
His feeling description of his own sufferings, and his pompous
account of the country which he had discovered, confirmed by
the specimens of its produaions which he exhibited, made such
an impreflion both on Charles and his ministers, that they not
only approved of the intended expedition, but seemed to be
interefled in the success of its leader. Presuming on those dif-
positions in his favour, Pizarro paid little attention to the

and emoluments usually granted to adventurers in the New co:lil nm d to

leagues along the coafl to the south of the river St. Jago, to be
independent of the governor of Panama; and he had power to
nominate all the officers who were to serve under him. In re-
turn for those conccffions, which cost the court of Spain no-
thing, as the enjoyment of them depended upon the success of
his own efforts, Pizarro engaged to raise two hundred and fifty
men, and to provide the flhips, arms, and warlike flores requi-
iite towards fubjeding, to the crown of Caflile, the country of
which the government was allotted him.

birth, and by Francisco de Alcantara, his mother's brother.
They were all in the prime of life, and of such abilities and

His reconci-
iaion with exasperated at the manner in which lih had conduted his ne-
Allnagro gociation, that he not only retuied to a any longer in concert

with a man by whose perfidy he had been excluded from the
power and ho'nours to which he had a just claim, but laboured
to form a new aflociation, in order to thwart or to rival his for-
mer confederate in his discoveries. Pizarro, however, had
more wisdom and address than to susser a rupture so fatal to all
his schemes, to become irreparable. By offering voluntarily to
relinquish the office of adelantado, and promising to concur in
soliciting that title, with an independent government for Al-
magro, he gradually mitigated the rage of an open-hearted
soldier, which had been violent, but was not implacable. Lu-
que, highly atisfied with having been successful in all his own
pretensions, cordially seconded Pizarro's endeavours. A recon-
ciliation was effetecd; and the confederacy renewed on its ori-
ginal terms, that the cnterprile should be carried on at the
common expence of the aociates, and the profits accruing
from it should be equally divided among them .

interest, three small vessels, and a hundred and eighty soldiers,
thirty-fix of whom were horsemen, composed the armament Thcir arna-
which they were able to fit out. But the aflonilhing progress ment.
of the Spaniards in America had inspired them with such
ideas of their own superiority, that Pizarro did not hesitate to 153,.
fail with this contemptible force to invade a great empire. Al- Feb'uary
magro was left at Panama, as formerly, to follow him with
whlat reinforcement of men he flould be able to muller. As the
season for embarking was properly chosen, and the course of
navigation between Panama and Peru was now better known,
Pizarro completed the voyage in thirteen days; though, by the
force of the winds and currents, he was carried above a hundred
leagues to the north of Tumbez, the place of his destination,
and obliged to land his troops in the bay of St. Matthew.
Without losing a moment, he began to advance towards the
south, taking care, however, not to depart far from the sea- Lnids in
shore, both that he might easily effed a jundion with the sup-
plies which he expeced from Ianama, and secure a retreat in
cafe of any disaster, by keeping as near as poflible to his flips.
But as the country in several parts on the coast of Peru is bar-
ren, unhealthful, and thinly peopled ; as the Spaniards had to
pass all the rivers near their mouth, where the body of water is
greatef; and as the imprudence of Pizarro, in attacking the na-
tives when he should have fludied to gain their confidence, had
forced them to abandon their habitations; famine, fatigue, and
difeaefs of various kinds, brouglt upon him and his followers
calamities hardly inferior to those which they had endured in
their former expedition. What they now experienced corrc-
fponded o ill with the alluring dfcription of the country givel,
by Pizarro, that many began to reproach Iiiin, and every lfldicr
mufft have become cold to the fcrvice, if, even in this unfertile

VOL. II. Y region

I6i

B ;c1° K region of Peru, they had not met with fomc appearances of

wealth and cultivation, which feermed to junify the report of

15 jl. their leader. At length they reached the province of Coaque;
Apil 14. and, having surprised the principal icttlcment of the natives,

they seized there veficls and ornaments of gold and silver, to
the amount of thirty thousand pesos, with other booty of such
value, as dispelled all their doubts, and inspired the most de-
fponding with ianguine hopes '.

His mea2ftres PIZARRO himself was so much delighted with this rich
for obtaining
a reinfoice- spoil, which he conlidercd as the firif-fruits of a land swing
"elt. with treasure, that he instantly dispatched one of his hips to

Panama with a large remittance to Almagro; and another to
Nicaragua with a considerable fum to some persons of influence
in that province, in hopes of alluring adventurers, by this early
display of the wealth which he had acquired. Meanwhile, he
continued his march along the coast, and disdaining to employ
any means of reducing the natives but force, he attacked them
with such violence in their scattered habitations, as compelled
them either to retire into the interior country, or to submit to
his yoke. This fuddcn appearance of invaders, whose apee-
and manners were so firange, and whose power seemed to be
so irresistible, made the fame dreadful impression as in other
parts of America. Pizarro hardly met with resistance until lie
attacked the island of Puna in the bay of Guayquil. As that
was better peopled than the country through which lie had
pafled, and its inhabitants fierccr and lels civilized tlan tholc
of the continent, they defended themfclves with fiuch obslinatc
valour, that Pizarro spent fix months in reducing tlhem to i'ilb-
,jcdiion. From Puna he proceeded to Tumbcz, where the di£-

America. From Tumbez he proceeded to the river Piura, and May i1.
in an advantageous station near the mouth of it, he eflabliflhcd
the firPt Spanish colony in Peru; to which he gave the name of
St. Michael.

As izarro continued to advance towards the centre of the

Peruvian empire, he gradually received more full information
concerning its extent and policy, as well as the situation of its
affairs at that junaure. WVithout some knowledge of these, he
could not have conducced his operations with propriety; and
without a suitable attention to there, it is impollible to account
for the progrcfs which the Spaniards had already made, or to

was originally possessed by small independent tribes, differing
from each other in manners, and in their forms of rude policy.
All, however, were so little civilized, that, if the traditions
concerning their mode of life, preserved among their descend-
ants, deserve credit, they muff be classed among the mofi un-
improved savages of America. Strangers to every species of
cultivation or regular industry, without any fixed residence,
and unacquainted with those sentiments and obligations which
form the firfl bonds of social union, they are said to have
roamed about naked in the forests, with which the country
was then covered, more like wild beasts than like men. After
they had firuggled for several ages with the hardships and ca-
lamities which are inevitable in this barbarous state, and when
no circumstance seemed to indicate the approach of any un-
common effort towards improvement, we are told that there
appeared on the banks of the lake Titiaca, a man and woman
of majestic form, and clothed in decent garments. They
declared themselves to be the children of the Sun, ent by their
beneficent parent, who beheld with pity the miseries of the
human race, to inflruct and to reclaim them. At their per-
suasion, enforced by reverence for the divinity in whose name
they were supposed to speak, several of the dispersed savages
united together, and receiving their commands as heavenly in-
juncions, followed them to Cuzco, where they fettled, and
began to lay the foundations of a city.

MANCO CAPAC and Mama Ocollo, for filch were the names

of those extraordinary personages, having thus collccled some
wandering tribes, formed that social union, which, by multi-
plying the desires, and uniting the efforts of the human species,

excites
164

excites induttry, and leads to improvement. Manco Capac ol l K
infiruded the men in agriculture, and other useful arts. Mama ----
Ocollo taught the women to spin and to weave. By the labour
of the one sex, fubfifence became less precarious; by tlat of
the other, life was rendered more comfortable. After securing
the objects of first ncceflity in an infant slate, by providing
food, raiment, and habitations for the rude people of whom
he took charge, Manco Capac turned his attention towards
introducing such laws and policy as might perpetuate their
happiness. By his inflitutions, which flall be more particu-
larly explained hereafter, the various relations in private life
were eftablihed, and the duties resulting from them prescribed
with such propriety, as gradually formed a barbarous people to
decency of manners. In public adminifiration, the fun&ions
of persons in authority were so precisely defined, and the sub-
ordination of those under their jurifdiaion maintained with
such a heady hand, that the society in which he presided, soon
assumed the aspet of a regular and well-governed slate.

THUS, according to the Indian tradition, was founded the

empire of the Itcas or Lords of Peru. At first, its extent was
small. The territory of Manco Capac did not reach above
eight leagues from Cuzco. But within its narrow precinats,
he excrcifcd absolute and uncontrolled authority. Iis fuccef-
fors, as their dominions expanded, arrogated a similar jurifilic-
tion over their fubjcds: the dcfpotilf of Asia was not more
complete. The Incas were not only obeyed as monarchs, but
revered as divinities. lTheir blood was held to be sacred, and,
by prohilbiting iinterlarri::gcs witll tle people, was never con-
tamninated by mixinig vitli thiat of any other race. Tlie tamily,
thus separatcd from tlhe rcfl of the nation, was dillinguillhcd

by,

165

B o K Y

by peculiarities in.drefs and ornaments, -which it was unlawful
-- -- for others to aume. The monarch himself appeared with

53 ' ensigns of royalty referred for him alone; and received from

his fuljcelqs, marls of obsequious homage and refpet, which
.approached almofi to adoration.

BULT, among the Peruvians, this unbounded power of their

,monarchs is aid to have been uniformly accompanied with at-
tention to the good of their fubljes. It was not the rage of
conquest, if we may believe the accounts of their countrymen,
that prompted the Incas to extend their dominions, but the
desire of diffusing the bleflings of civilization, and the know-
ledge of the arts which they poffefied, among the barbarous
people whom"they reduced. During a succession of twelve
monarchs, it is said that not one deviated from this beneficent
character '

W-IEN the Spaniards first visited the coast of Peru, in

:the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-fix, Huana
Capac, the twelfth monarch from the founder of the slate,
was feated on the throne. He is represented as a prince
diflinguiflled not only for the pacific virtues peculiar to
the race, but eminent for his martial talents. By his vic-
torious arms the kingdom of Quito was fubjcded, a con-
quest of fich extent and importance as almost doubled the
.power of the Peruvian empire. He was fond of residing in
the capital of that valuable province, which he had added to
his dominions; and, notwithfianding the ancient and funda-
mental law of the monarchy against polluting the royal blood

by any foreign alliance, he married the daughter of the van- B o0 IK
quihed monarch of Quito. She bore him a son named Atahual- _---
pa, whom, on his death at Quito, which fccms to have happened 53.
about the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-nine, he
appointed his fucceflbr in that kingdom, leaving the reit of his
dominions to Huafcar, his eldest son, by a mother of the royal
race. Greatly as the Peruvians revered the memory of a monarch
who had reigned with more reputation and splendour than any of
his predecessors, the dcfiination of H-uana Capac concerning the
succession, appeared so repugnant to a maxim coeval with the
empire, and founded on authority deemed sacred, that it was
no fooncr known at Cuzco than it excited general difguit. En-
couraged by those sentiments of his fubjecls, Huafcar required
his brother to renounce the government of Quito, and to ac-
knowlcdge him as his lawful superior. But it had been the
first care of Atahualpa to gain a large body of troops which
had accompanied his father to Quito. These were the flower
of the Peruvian warriors, to whose valour Huana Capac had
been indebted for all his victories. Relying on their fipport,
Atahualpa firfl eluded his brother's demand, and then marched
against him in hostile array.

Had he made any hostile attempt in his former visit to Peru
in the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-feven,
he must then have encountered the force of a powerful
state, united under a monarch, possessed of capacity and
courage, and unembarraffed with any care that could divert
him from opofing his progress. But at this time, the two
competitors, though they received early accounts of the arrival
and violent proceedings of the Spaniards, were so intent upon
the operations of a war, which they deemed more intereiting,
that they paid no attention to the motions of an enemy, too
inconsiderable in number, to excite any great alarm, and to
whose career, it would be easy, as they imagined, to give a
check when more at leisure.

plete information, with refpea to it, they received from mef- B o o K
fengers whom Huafcar sent to Pizarro, in order to solicit his t_---
aid against Atahualpa, whom he represented as a rebel and an ' 52'
usurper ". Pizarro perceived at once the importance of this in-
telligence, and foresaw so clearly all the advantages which might
be derived from this divided state of the kingdom which he had
invaded, that, without waiting for the reinforcement which he
expected from Panama, he determined to push forward, while
intefline discord put it out of the power of the Peruvians
to attack him with their whole force, and while, by taking
part, as circumstances should incline him, with one of the
competitors, he might be enabled with greater ease to crufli
both. Enterprising as the Spaniards of that age were in all
their operations against Americans, and diflinguiihed as Pizarro
was among his countrymen for daring courage, we can hardly
suppose, that after having proceeded hitherto slowly, and with
much caution, he would have changed at once his system of
operation, and have ventured upon a measure so hazardous,
without some new motive or prospect to justify it.

he began his march with a very slender and ill-accoutred train of
followers. They consisted of fixty-two horsemen , and a hun-
dred and two foot-foldiers, of whom twenty were armed with
cross-bows, and three with muskets. He direted his course
towards Caxamalca, a small town at the distance of twelve days

sent from that prince, accompanied with a proffer of his alliance,
and assurances of a friendly reception at Caxamalca. Pizarro,
according to the usual artifice of his countrymen in America,
pretended to come as the ambassador of a very powerful mo-
narch, and declared that he was now advancing with an inten-
tion to offer Atahualpa his aid against those enemies who dif-
puted his title to the throne .

Ideas of the As the object of the Spaniards in entering their country was

whether they hould confider their new guests as beings of a
superior nature, who had visited them from some beneficent
motive, or as formidable avengers of their crimes, and enemies
to their repose and liberty. The continual professions of the
Spaniards, that they came to enlighten them with the know-
ledge of truth, and lead them in the way of happiness, favoured
the former opinion; the outrages which they committed, their
rapaciousness and cruelty, were awful confirmations of the latter.
While in this state of uncertainty, Pizarro's declaration of his
pacific intentions so far removed all the Inca's fears, that he
determined to give him a friendly reception. In consequence
of this resolution, the Spaniards were allowed to march in
tranquillity across the sandy desert between St. Michael and
Motupe, where the most feeble effort of an enemy, added to,

that comfortless region, must have proved fatal to them ". B K
From Motupe they advanced towards the mountains which en-
compass the low country of Peru, and passed through a defile 1'i'
so narrow and inaccessible, that a few men might have defended
it against a numerous army. But here likewise, from the fame
inconsiderate credulity of the Inca, the Spaniards met with no op-
position, and took quiet possession of a fort erected for the fecu-
rity of that important fation. As they now approached near to
Caxamalca, Atahualpa renewed his professions of friendship;
and as an evidence of their sincerity, sent them presents of
greater value than the former.

ON entering Caxamalca, Pizarro took possession of a large Arrive at

court, on one fide of which was a house which the Spanish Caxai'alca.
hiflorians call a palace of the Inca, and on the other a temple
of the Sun, the whole filrrounded with a strong rampart or wall
of earth. When he had pofled his troops in this advantageous
station, he dispatched Hernando Soto, and his brother Ferdi-
nand, to the camp of Atahualpa, which was about a league
diflant from the town. He inftruded them to confirm the de-
claration which he had formerly made of his pacific disposition,
and to desire an interview with the Inca, that he might explain
more fully the intention of the Spaniards in visiting his country.
They were treated with all the refpedful hospitality usual among
the Peruvians in the reception of their most cordial friends,
and Atahualpa promised to visit the Spanish commander next
day in his quarters. The decent deportment of the Peruvian
monarch, the order of his court, and the reverence with which
his fubjeds approached his person and obeyed his commands,
afloniflhed those Spaniards, who had never met in Amerisa with

camp. The rich ornaments worn by him ad his attendants,
the vessels of gold and silver in which the repast offered to them
was served up, the multitude of utensils of every kind formed
of those precious metals, opened profpeats far exceeding any

beheld, they gave such a description of it to their countrymen,
as confirmed Pizarro in a resolution which he had already taken.
From his own observation of American manners during his long
service in the New World, as well as from the advantages which
Cortes had derived from seizing Montezuma, he knew of what
consequence it was to, have the Inca in his power. For this
purpose, he formed a plan as daring as it was perfidious. Not-
withstanding the character he had assumed of an ambassador
from a powerful monarch, who courted an alliance with the
Inca, and in violation of the repeated offers which he had made
to him of his own friendflip and axiftance, he determined to
avail himself of the unfiifpicious simplicity with which Ata-
hualpa relied on his professions, and to seize his person during
the interview to which he had invited him. He prepared for
the execution of his scheme with the fame deliberate arrange-
ment, and with as little compuntion, as if it had reflected no
disgrace on himself or his country. He divided his cavalry into
three finall squadrons, under the command of his brother Ser-
dinand, Soto, and Benalcazar; his infantry were formed in

the day was far advanced before he began his march. Even
then, left the order of the procession should be deranged, he
moved so slowly, that the Spaniards became impatient and ap-
prehenfive that some suspicion of their intention might be the
cause of this delay. In order to remove this, Pizarro dispatched
one of his officers with fresh assurances of his friendly difpofi-
tion. At length the Inca approached. First of all appeared
four hundred men, in an uniform dress, as harbingers to clear
the way before him. He himself, fitting on a throne or couch,
adorned with plumes of various colours, and almost covered
with plates of gold and silver enriched with precious flones,
was carried on the houlders of his principal attendants. Behind
him came some chief officers of his court, carried in the fame

amounting to more than thirty thousand men.

to submit to the king of Caflile as his lawful sovereign, pro-
mifing, if he complied instantly with this requisition, that the

so extraordinary. " In this book," answered Valverde, reach-
ing out to him his breviary. The Inca opened it eagerly, and
turning over the leaves, lifted it to his ear: " This," fays he,
" is silent; it tells me nothing ;" and threw it with disdain
to the ground. The enraged monk, running towards his
countrymen, cried out, " To arms, Christians, to arms; the

prisoner to his quarters. The fate of the monarch increased
the precipitate flight of his followers. The Spaniards pursued
them towards every quarter, and with deliberate and unrelent-
ing barbarity continued to slaughter wretched fugitives, who
never once offered at refinance. The carnage did not cease
until the close of day. Above four thousand Peruvians were
killed. Not a single Spaniard fell, nor was one wounded but

THE plunder of the field was rich beyond any idea which the

as a ransom what aflonifhed the Spaniards, even after all they
now knew concerning the opulence of his kingdom. The
apartment in which he was confined was twenty-two feet in
length and sixteen in breadth; he undertook to fill it with
veflels of gold as high as he could reach. Pizarro closed eagerly
with this tempting proposal, and a line was drawn upon the
walls of the chamber, to mark the flipulatcd height to which
the treasure was to rife.

ATAIUALPA, transported with having obtained ome pro-

fpet of liberty, took measures instantly for fulfilling his part
of the agreement, by fending messengers to Cuzco, Qito, and
other places, where gold had been amassed in largest quantities,
either for adorning the temples of their gods, or the houses of
the Inca, to bring what was necessary for completing his ran-
fom direcly to Caxanmalca. Though Atahualpa was now in
the custody of his enemies, yet so much were the Peruvians
accuflomed to refpcd every mandate issued by their fovcrcign,
that his orders were executed with the greatest alacrity. Soothed
with hopes of recovering his liberty by this means, the fubjels
of the Inca were afraid of endangering his life by forming any
other fchcme for his relief; and though the force of the empire
was flill entire, no preparations were made, and no army aflcmblcd

part of the flipulated quantity was now amafred, and Atahualpa the oil
assured the Spaniards, that the only thing which prevented the
whole from being brought in, was the remoteness of the pro-
vinces where it was deposited. But such vail piles of gold, pre-
sented continually to the view of needy soldiers, had so inflamed
their avarice, that it was inpoffible any longer to restrain their
impatience to obtain possession of this rich booty. Orders were
given for melting down the whole, except some pieces of cu-
rious fabric, reserved as a present for the emperor. After set-
ting apart the fifth due to the crown, and a hundred thousand
pesos as a donative to the soldiers which arrived with Almagro,
there remained one million five hundred and twenty-eight
thousand five hundred pesos to Pizarro and his followers.
The feltival of St. James, the patron faint of Spain, was the July zS.

of conduting it strongly marks that firange alliance of fana-
ticism with avarice, which I have more than once had occasion
to point out as a striking feature in the character of the con-
querors of the New World. Though aflcmblcd to divide
the spoils of an innocent people, procured by deceit, extor-
tion, and cruelty, the tranfaclion began with a solemn invo-
cation of the name of God ', as if they could have expeed
the guidance of Heaven in distributing those wages of ini-
quity. In this division above eight thousand pesos, at that
time not inferior in value to as many pounds Sterling in the

1533. received dividends in proportion to the dignity of their rank.

The effea of TIlERE is no example in history of such a sudden acquisition
it. of wealth by military service, nor was ever a fum so great di-

vided among so finall a number of soldiers. Many of them
having received a recompence for their services far beyond their
nmofl sanguine hopes, were so impatient to retire fiom fatigue
and danger, in order to spend the remainder of their days in their
native country, in ease and opulence, that they demanded their
discharge with clamorous importunity. Pizarro, sensible that
from such men he could exped neither enterprise in ation nor
fortitude in suffering, and persuaded that wherever they went,
the display of their riches would allure adventurers, less opulent
but more hardy, to his flandard, granted their suit without re-
luctance, and permitted above sixty of them to accompany his
brother Ferdinand, whom he ent to Spain with an account of
his success, and the present destined for the emperor'.

The Tnca de- TrHE Spaniards having divided among them the treasure
,nady hi' amafled for the Inca's ransom, he insisted with them to fulfil

ai. itheir promise of setting him at liberty. But nothing was far-

ther from Pizarro's thoughts. During his long service in the
New World, he had imbibed those ideas and maxims of his
fcllow-loldiers, which led them to confider its inhabitants as an
inferior race, neither worthy of the name, nor intitlcd to the
rights, of men. In his compact with Atahualpa, he had no
other object than to aufe his captive with such a proflipc of

recovering his liberty, as might induce him to lend all the aid B 0 0 K
of his authority towards collecting the wealth of his kingdom. -
Having now accomplished this, he no longer regarded his '53'
plighted faith, and at the very time when the credulous prince
hoped to be replaced on his throne, he had fccretly rcfolved to
bereave him of life. Many circumflances fcem to have con-
curred in prompting him to this aion, the mol criminal and
atrocious that slains the Spanish name, amidst all the deeds of
violence committed in carrying on the conquct of the New
World.

THOUGH Pizarro had seized the Inca, in imitation of Cor- Heandtlie

tes's condua towards the Mexican monarch, he did not possess rmutuilljca
talents for carrying on the fame artful planof policy. Deflitute lou.
of the temper and address requisite for gaining the confidence
of his prisoner, he never reaped all the advantages which might
have been derived from being mafler of his person and autho-
rity. Atahualpa was, indeed, a prince of greater abilities and
discernment than Montezuma, and seems to have penetrated
more thoroughly into the character and intentions of the Spa-
niards. Mutual suspicion and diltruf accordingly took place
between them. The ftrid attention with which it was necef-
fary to guard a captive of such importance, greatly increased
the fatigue of military duty. The utility of keeping him ap-
peared inconsiderable; and Pizarro felt him as an incumbcr-

w33 ere apprehensive, that as long as Atahualpa remained a
prisoner, Pizarro's soldiers would apply whatever treasure
should be acquired, to make up what was wanting of the quan-
tity flipulated for his ransom, and under that pretext exclude
them from any part of it. They infifled eagerly on putting the
Inca to death, that all the adventurers in Peru might thereafter
be on an equal footing'.

Motives PIZARRO himself began to be alarmed with accounts of
which induc-
edI'izarroto forces assembling in the remote provinces of the empire, and
content. fufpeded Atahualpa of having ifrued orders for that purpose.

These fears.and suspicions were artfully increased by Phillppillo,
one of the Indians whom Pizarro had carried off from Tumbez
in the year one thousand five hundred and twenty, and whom he
employed as an interpreter. The funcion which he performed
admitting this man to familiar intercourse with the captive mo-
narch, heprefumed, notwithstanding the meanness of his birth, to
raise his affeaions to a Coya, or descendant of the Sun, one of
Atahualpa's wives ; and feeing noprofpet of gratifying that pas-
sion during the life of the monarch, he endeavoured to fill the
ears of the Spaniards with such accounts of his secret dcfigns
and preparations, as might awaken their jealousy and incite
them to cut him off.

WHILE Almagro and his followers openly demanded the life

of the Inca, and Philippillo laboured to ruin him by private
machinations, that unhappy prince inadvertently contributed
to haflen his own fate. During his confinement he had at-

But in the pretence of the governor he was uneasy, and over-
awed. This dread soon came to be mingled with contempt.
Among all the European arts, what he admired moil was that
of reading and writing; and he long deliberated with himself,
whether he should regard it as a natural or acquired talent. In
order to determine this, he desired one of the soldiers, who
guarded him, to write the name of God on the nail of his thumb.
This he flewed successively to several Spaniards, asking its
meaning; and to his amazement, they all, without hesitation,
returned the fame answer. At length Pizarro entered; and on
presenting it to him, he blushed, and with ome confusion was
obliged to acknowledge his ignorance. From that moment,
Atahualpa confidered him as a mean person, less inftruted
than his own oldiers ; and he had not address enough to con-
ceal the sentiments with which this discovery inspired him. To
be the object of a barbarian's scorn, not only mortified the pride
of Pizarro, but excited such resentment in his breat, as added'

a charge was exhibited still more amazing. It confifed of va-
rious articles; that Atahualpa, though a bafRard, had difpofleffed
the rightful owner of the throne, and usurped the regal power;
that he had put his brother and lawful overeign to death; that
he was an idolater, and had not only permitted, but commanded
the offering of human sacrifices; that he had a great number of
concubines; that since his imprisonment he had wafted and em-
bezzled the royal treasures, which now belonged of right to the
conquerors; that he had incited his fubjets to take arms against
the Spaniards. On these heads of accusation, some of which
are so ludicrous, others so absurd, that the effrontery of
Pizarro, in making them the foundation of a serious proce-
dure, is not less surprising than his injultice, did the court
go on to try the sovereign of a great empire, over whom it
had no jurifdiaion. With rcfpea to each of the articles, wit-
nefies were examined; but as they delivered their evidence in
their native tongue, Philippillo had it in his power to give their
words whatever turn belt fited his malevolent intentions.
To judges predetermined in their opinion, this evidence appeared

ie s crn- frilicient. They pronounced Atahualpa guilty, and condemned

him to be burnt alive. Friar Valverde proftituted the authority
of his lacred funtion to confirm this sentence, and by his fig-
naturc warranted it to be jufl. Aftoniihcd at his fate, Ata-

would be the arbiter of his lot. But pity never touched the -
unfeeling heart of Pizarro. He ordered him to be led instantly 1s33'
to execution; and what added to the bitterness of his last
moments, the fame monk who had just ratified his doom, of-
sered to console, and attempted to convert him. The most
powerful argument Valverde employed to prevail with him to
embrace the Christian faith, was a promise of a mitigation in
his punishment. The dread of a cruel death extorted from the
trembling victim a desire of receiving baptism. The ceremony
was performed; and Atahualpa, instead of being burnt, was and exectted.

HAPPILY for the credit of the Spanish nation, even among Several Spa-

the profligate adventurers which it sent forth to conquer and niards protet
desolate the New World, there were persons who retained some
tinaure of the Castilian generosity and honour. Though, before
the trial of Atahualpa, Ferdinand Pizarro had set out for Spain,
and Soto was sent on a separate command at a distance from Cax-
amalca, this odious tranfadion was not carried on without censure
and opposition. Several officers, and among those some of the
greatest reputation and most refpeaable families in the service,
not only remonstrated, but protested against this measure of their
general, as disgraceful to their country, as repugnant to every
maxim of equity, as a violation of public faith, and an ufurpa-
tion ofjurifdition over an independent monarch, to which they
had no title. But their endeavours were vain. Numbers, and

Diflolution of ON the death of Atahualpa, Pizarro invested one of his sons
nd order in with the ensigns of royalty, hoping that a young man without
Perul experience might prove a more passive instrument in his hands,

than an ambitious monarch, who had been accustomed to inde-
pendent command. The people of Cuzco, and the adjacent
country, acknowledged Manco Capac, a brother of Huafcar,
as Inca P. But neither possessed the authority which belonged
to a sovereign of Peru. The violent convulsions into which
the empire had been thrown, first by the civil war between the
two brothers, and then by the invasion of the Spaniards, had
not only deranged the order of the Peruvian government, but
almost dissolved its frame. When they beheld their monarch
a captive in the power of strangers, and at last suffering an ig-
nominious death, the people in several provinces, as if they had
been set free from every restraint of law and decency,. broke
out into the most licentious excesses q. So many descendents of
the Sun, after being treated with the utmost indignity, had been
cut off by Atahualpa, that not only their influence in the slate
diminiflhed with their number, but the accustomed reverence
fo.r that sacrcd race sensibly decreased. In consequence of this

aspired to independent authority, and usurped jurifdiion to - -~
which they had no title. The general who commanded for 133'
Atahualpa in Quito, seized the brother and children of his
master, put them to a cruel death, and disclaiming any con-
neCtion with either Inca, endeavoured to eflablifh a separate
kingdom for himself'.

THE Spaniards, with pleafurle, beleld the spirit of discord p;,lro d.

diffusing itself, and the vigour of government relaxing among ,nc to
the Peruvians. They confidered those disorders as symptoms
of a fate hastening towards its dissolution. Pizarro no longer
hesitated to advance towards Cuzco, and he had received such
considerable reinforcements, that he could venture, with little
danger, to penetrate so far into the interior part of the country.
The account of the wealth acquired at Caxamalca, operated as
he had foreseen. No sooner did his brother Ferdinand, with
the officers and soldiers, to whom he had given their discharge
after the partition of the Inca's ransom, arrive at Panama,
and display their riches in the view of their aftonifled country-
men, than fame spread the account with such exaggeration
through all the Spanish settlements on the South Sea, that the
governors of Guatimala, Panama, and Nicaragua, could hard-
ly restrain the people under their jurifdi'tion, fromi abandon-
ing their pofTefions, and crowding to that inexhaufliblc source
of wealth which seemed to be opened in Peru'. In spite of
every check and regulation, such numbers retorted thither,
that Pizarro began his march at the head of five undred

fierce encounters happened. But they terminated, like all the
aCtions in America; a few Spaniards were killed or wounded;
the natives were put to flight with incredible slaughter. At
length Pizarro forced his way to Cuzco, and took quiet pof-
session of that capital. The riches found there, even after all
that the natives had carried off and concealed, either from a
fuperfitious veneration for the ornaments of their temples, or
out of hatred for their rapacious conquerors, exceeded in value

this passion. Leaving a sufficient force to protec the infant B K
settlement entrufled to his care, he placed himself at the head .I--
of the reft, and set out to attempt the reducion of Quito, '533
where, according to the report of the natives, Atahualpa had
left the greatest part of his treasure, Notwithstanding the vast
distance of that city from St. Michael, the difficulty of march-
ing through a mountainous country covered with woods, and.
the frequent and fierce attacks of the best troops in Peru, com-
manded by a skilful leader, the valour, good conduct, and per-
severance of Benalcazar surmounted every obstacle, and he en-
tered Quito with his victorious troops. But they met with a
cruel mortification there. The natives, now acquainted, to
their sorrow, with the predominant passion of their invaders)
and knowing how to disappoint it, had carried off all those

tinguifhed himself so eminently in the conquest of Mexico,
having obtained the government of Guatimala as a recompence
for his valour, soon became disgusted with a life of uniform
tranquillity, and longed to be again engaged in the bustle of

t - kingdom of Quito did not lie within the limits of the province

' 33' allotted to Pizarro, he resolved to invade it. The high repu-

tation of the commander allured volunteers from every quarter.
He embarked with five hundred men, of whom above two hun-
dred were of such distinCtion as to serve on horseback. He
landed at Puerto Viejo, and without sufficient knowledge of
the country, or proper guides to conduct him, attempted to
march direcly to Quito, by following the course of the river
Guayquil, and crofling the course of the Andes towards its
head. But in this route, one of the most impradicable in all
America, his troops endured such fatigue in forcing their way
through forests and marshes on the low grounds, and suffered
ib inuchf from exceflive cold when they began to ascend the
mountains, that before they reached the plain of Quito, a fifth
part of the men and half of their horses died, and the refl were
so much dispirited and worn out, as to be almost unfit for ser-
vice . There they met with a body, not of Indians but of
Spaniards, drawn up in hostile array againfl them. Pizarro,
having received an account of Alvarado's armament, had de-
tached Almagro with ome troops to oppose this formidable in-
vader of his jurifdicion ; and these were joined by Benalcazar
and his victorious party. Alvarado, though surprised at the
fight of enemies whom he did not expect, advanced boldly to
the charge. But, by the interposition of ome moderate men
in each party, an amicable accommodation took place; and the
fatal period, when Spaniards suspendcd their conquefs to em-
bruc their hands in the blood of their countrymen, was post-
poned a few years. Alvarado engaged to return to his go-

augment its strength .

BY this time Ferdinand Pizarro had landed in Spain. Tle I-Ionors con-

filled the kingdom with no less astonishment than they had "'!r°'

ceived by the emperor with the attention due to the bearer of a
present so rich as to exceed any idea which the Spaniards had
formed concerning the value of their acquisitions in America,
even after they had been ten years mailers of Mexico. In re-
compence of his brother's services, his authority was confirmed
with new powers and privileges, and the addition of seventy
leagues, extending along the coast, to the southward of the
territory granted in his former patent. Almagro received the
honours which he had so long desired. The title of Adelan-
tado, or governor, was conferred upon him, with jurifdilion
over two hundred leagues of country, firetching beyond the
southern limits of the province allotted to Pizarro. Ferdinand
himself did not go unrewarded. IIe was admitted into the

to oppose him. Each of the contending parties was supported
by powerful adherents, and the dispute was on the point of
being terminated by the sword, when Francis Pizarro arrived
in the capital. The reconciliation between him and Almagro
had never been cordial. The treachery of Pizarro in engrossing
to himself all the honours and emoluments, which ought to have
been divided with his associate, was always present in both
their thoughts. The one, conscious of his own perfidy, did
not expet forgiveness; the other, feeling that he had been
deceived, was impatient to be avenged; and though avarice
and ambition had induced them not only to dissemble their fen-
timents, but even to at in concert while in pursuit of wealth
and power, no sooner did they obtain poffeflion of these, than
the fame passions which had formed this temporary union,
gave rife to jealousy and discord. To each of them was at-
tached a small band of interested dependents, who, with the ma-
licious art, peculiar to such men, heightened their suspicions,
and magnified every appearance of offences. But with all those
feeds of enmity in their minds, and thus aiduoufly cherished,
,each was so thoroughly acquainted with the abilities and cou-
rage of his rival, that they equally dreaded the consequences
of an open rupture. The fortunate arrival of Pizarro at Cuzco,
and the address mingled with firmness, which he manifetled in
his expostulations with Almagro and his partizans, averted that
evil for the present. A new reconciliation took place; the chief

either Spanish or Indian, he applied himself with that perfc-
vering ardour, which diffinguifhes his character, to introduce a
form of regular government, into the extensive provinces sub-
jet to his authority. Though ill qualified by his education to
enter into any disquisition concerning the principles of civil
policy, and little accustomed by his former habits of life to
attend to its arrangements, his natural sagacity supplied the
want both of science and experience. He distributed the coun-
try into various difries; he appointed proper magifirates to
preside in each; and established regulations concerning the ad-
ministration of justice, the collection of the royal revenue, the
working of the mines, and the treatment of the Indians, ex-
tremely simple, but well calculated to promote the public
prosperity. But, though, for the present, he adapted his plan

4~ -'- situated in a corner of the empire, above four hundred miles-

5134" from the Tea, and much farther from Quito, a province of whose

value he had formed an high idea. No other settlement of the
Peruvians was so considerable as to merit the name of a town,
or to allure the Spaniards to fix their residence in it. But, in
marching through the country, Pizarro had been truck with
the beauty and fertility of the valley of Rimac, one of the
moit extensive and belt cultivated in Peru. There, on the banks
of a small river, of the fame name with the vale which it wa-
ters and enriches, at the distance of fix miles from Callao, the
molt commodious harbour in the Pacific Ocean, he founded a
city which h destined to be the capital of his government.

'53i5 He gave it the name of Ciudad de los Reyes, either from the
Jaay circumstance of having laid the first sone, at that season when

the church celebrates the festival of the Three Kings, or, as is
more probable, in honour of Juanna and Charles, the fove-
reigns of Castile. This name it fill retains among the Spaniards,
in all legal and formal deeds; but it is better known to so-
reigners by that of Lima, a corruption of the ancient appel-
lation of the valley, in which it is situated. Under his in-
fpedion, the buildings advanced with such rapidity, that it
soon assumed the form of a city, which, by a magnificent pa-
lace that he ereced for himself, and by the flately houses built
by several of his officers, gave, even in its infancy, ome in-
dication of its subsequent grandeur d.

five hundred and seventy men, the greatest body of Europeans 's35
that had hitherto been assembled in Peru. From impatience
to finish the expedition, or from that contempt of hardship and
danger acquired by all the Spaniards who had served long in
America, Almagro, instead of advancing along the level coun-
try on the coast, chore to march across the mountains by a route
that was fhortcr indeed, but almost impracicable. In this at-
tempt his troops were exposed to every calamity which men
can susser, from fatigue, from famine, and from the rigour of
the climate in those elevated regions of the torrid zone, where
the degree of cold is hardly inferior to what is felt within the
polar circle. Many of them perished; and the survivors, when
they descended into the fertile plains of Chili, had new difficul-
ties to encounter. They found there a race of men very dif-
ferent from the people of Peru, intrepid, hardy, independent,
and in their bodily constitution, as well as vigour of spirit,
nearly resembling the warlike tribes in North America. Though
filled with wonder at the first appearance of the Spaniards, and
still more aftoniflled at the operations of their cavalry and the
effeas of their fire-arms, the Chilefe oon recovered so far
fiom their surprise, as not only to defend thenmfelvcs with ob-
flinacy, but to attack their new enemies with more determined
fierccnefs than any American nation had hitherto difcovcred.

accumulating in-dependent fortunes at once, that, to men pof-
sessed with notions so extravagant, any mention of acquiring
wealth gradually, and by schemes of patient industry, would
have been not only a disappointment, but an infalt. In order
to find occupation for men who could not with- safety be allowed
to remain inacive, Pizarro encouraged some of the most diftin-
guifhed officers who had lately joined him, to invade different
provinces of the empire, which the Spaniards had not hitherto
visited. Several large bodies were formed-for this purpose.;
and about the time that Almagro set out -for Chili, they marched.

tirpating its oppressors. Though fridly watched by the Spa-
niards, who allowed him to reside in the palace of his anceflors
at Cuzco, he found means of communicating his scheme to the
persons who were to be entrufled with the execution of..it.

they had long entertained of their voluntary departure were B K
altogether vain. All perceived that a vigorous effort of the
whole nation was requisite to expel them, and the preparations 535
for it were carried on with the secrecy and silence peculiar to
Americans.

AFTER some unsuccessful attempts of the Inca to make his and progrefsi

escape, Ferdinand Pizarro happening to arrive at that time in
Guzco, he obtained permission from him to attend a great fefli- 1536.
val which was to be celebrated a few leagues from the capital.
Under pretext of that solemnity, the great men of the empire
were assembled. As soon as the.Inca joined them, the.ftandard
of war was ereced; and in a short time all the fighting men,
from the confines of Quito to the frontier of Chili, were in
arms. Many Spaniards, living securely on the fcttlements al-
lotted them,. were massacred- Several detachments, as they
marched carelessly through a country which seemed to be. tamely
submissive to their dominion, were cut off to a man. An army
amounting (if we may believe the Spanish writers) to two hun-
dred thousand men attacked. Cuzco, which the three brotlhrs
endeavoured to defend with only a hundred and seventy Spa-
niards. Another formidable body invceted Lima, and kept tle
governor closely ihut up. There was no longer any commu-
nication between the two cities; the numerous forces of the
Peruvians freading. over. the country, intercepted every mef-
fengcr; and as the parties in Cuzco and Lima were cqually
unacquainted with· the fate of their countrymen, each boded
the worlt concerning the other, and imagined that they tlicm-
felvcs were the only persons who had survivcd .the general ex-
tinaion of the Spanilli name in Peru.'.

rocity as the Mexican warriors, they conduced ome of their
operations in a manner which discovered greater sagacity, and a
genius more susceptible of improvement in the military art.
They not only observed the advantages which the Spaniards
derived from their discipline and their weapons, but they en-
deavoured to imitate the former, and turn the latter against
tlhem. They armed a considerable body of their bravest war-
riors with the swords, the spears, and bucklers, which they had
taken from the Spanifl soldiers whom they had cut off in dif-
ferent parts of the country. These they endeavoured to marshal
in that regular compad order, to which experience had taught
them that the Spaniards were indebted for their irrefiflible force
in aion. Some appeared in the field with Spanish -muskets,
and had acquired fill and resolution enough to use them. A
few of the boldest, among whom was the Inca himself, were
mounted on the horses which they had taken, and advanced
briskly to the charge like Spanish cavaliers, with their lances
in the reft. It was more by their numbers, however, than by
those impcrfet eflays to imitate European arts, and employ
European arms, that the Peruvians annoyed the Spaniards .
In spite of the valour, heightened by delfair, with which the
three brothers defended Cuzco, Manco Capac recovered pof-

or to take precautions against him as an enemy. The latter,
knowing the points in contest between him and his country-
men, flattered themselves that they had more to hope than to
dread from his operations. Almagro himself, unacquainted
with the detail of the events which had happened in his ab-
fence, and solicitous to learn the precise pofiure of affairs,
advanced towards the capital slowly, and with great circuni-
fpeclion. Various negotiations with both parties were set on
foot. The Inca conducted them on his part with much address.
At firfi he .endeavoured to gain the friendship of Almagro;
and after many fiuitlefs overtures, despairing of any cordial
union with a Spaniard, he attacked him by surprise with a nu-
merous body of chosen troops. But the Spanifi discipline and
valour maintained their wonted superiority. The Peruvians
were repulsed with such slaughter, that a great part of their
army dispersed, and Almagro proceeded to the gates of Cuzco
without interruption.

and took measures to obflrut his entry into the capital. Pru-

turning their arms against one another, while surrounded by

The generous, open, affable temper of Almagro gained many B K
adherents of the Pizarros, who were disgustcd ,ith tlieir harsh ----
domineering manners. Encouraged by this defecion, he ad-
vanced towards the city by night, furp:-ifed the ccntinels, or
was admitted by them, and investing the house where the two
brothers resided, compelled them, after an obflinate defence,
to firrender at discretion. Almagro's claim ofjurifdiion over
Cuzco was universally acknowledged, and a form of admini-
ftration established in his name .

Two or three persons only were killed in this firfl adt of civil ciji ,.

Francis Pizarro having dispersed the Peruvians who had in- mag;o,
veiled Lima, and received some considerable reinforcements
from Hispaniola and Nicaragua, ordered five hundred mcii,
under the command of Alonfo de Alvarado, to march to Cuzco,
in hopes of relieving his brothers, if they and their garrison
were not already cut off by the Peruvians. This body, which,
in the infancy of the Spanish power in America, must be
deemed a considerable force, advanced near to the capital before
they knew that they had any enemy more formidable than In-
dians to encounter. It was with atfonifhment that they beheld
their countrymen posted on the banks of the river Abancay to
oppose their progress. Almagro, however, wishcd rather to
gain than to conquer them, and by bribes and promises endea-
voured to seduce their leader. The fidelity of Alvarado re-
mained unflaken; but his talents for war were not equal to
his virtue. Almagro anmufed him with various movements, of
whicl lie did not comprehend the meaning, while a large de- J,'y 12.

well how to improve as how to gain a vicory. Rodrigo Or-
gognez, an officer of great abilities, who having served under
the conflable Bourbon, when he led the Imperial army to Rome,
had been accuflomed to bold and decisive counsels, advised him
instantly to issue orders for putting to death Ferdinand and
Gonzalo Pizarros, Alvarado, and a few other persons whom
lie could not hope to gain, and to march directly with his vic-
torious troops to Lima, before the governor had time to pre-
pare for his defence. But Almagro, though he discerned at
once the utility of the counsel, and had courage to have
carried it into execution, suffered himself to be influenced
by sentiments unlike those of a soldier of fortune grown
old in fervicc, and by scruples which suited not the chief of
a party who had drawn his sword in civil war. Ieelings of
humanity reflrained himn from fliedding the blood of his
opponents; and the dread of being deemed a rebel deterred him
from entering a province which the king had allotted to another.
Though lie knew that arms mufi terminate the dispute between
him and Pizarro, and resolved not to ihun that mode of deci-

PIZARRo was flill unacquainted with all the interefling D:! cr.,f

events that had happened near Cuzco. The account of Alma-
gro's return, of the loss of the capital, of the death of one bro-
tlcer, of the imprisonment of the other two, and of the defeat
of Alvarado, were brought to him at once. Such a tide of
misfortunes almost overwhelmed a pirit which had continued
firn and erel under the rudlet fiocks of adversity. lut the
neccflity of attending to his own safety, as wecll as the decire of
revenge, preserved him from inking under it. Ile took inca-
iurcs for both with his wonted sagacity. As he lhad the coin- lli :,fTl
mand of the fea-coafl, and expected considerable supplics both
of men and of military fores, it was no less his interest to gain
time, and to avoid aion, than it was that of Almagro to pre-
cipitate operations, and bring the contest to a fpecdy issue. He
had recourse to arts which he had formerly practiicd with fuc-
cess, and Almagro was again weak enough to furler hilnfelf to
be amused with a prospect of terminating their diflerlcnces by
tome amicable accommodation. By varying his overtures, and
flifting his ground as often as it suited his purpole, fomctimes
fccming to yield every thing that his rival could dclire, and
then rctracing all that he had granted, Pizarro dexteronfly pro-
tra&dcd the negociation to such a length, tlat though every day
was precious to Almagro, several months laipld wilitout coiinig
to any final agreement. While thle attention of Almnagro, and
of the ofliccrs with whom lie consultcd, vwas occulied in de-

having thus delivered one of his brothers, the governor scrupled
not at one ad- of perfidy more to procure the release of the
other. He proposed, that every point in controversy between
Almagro and himfelffhould be submitted to the decision of their
sovereign; that until his award was known, each should retain
undisturbed pofffion of whatever part of the country he now
occupied; that Ferdinand Pizarro should be set at liberty, and
return inflantly to Spain, together with the officers, whom
Almagro purposed to fend thither to represent the justice of his
claims. Obvious as the design of Pizarro was in those propo-
fitions, and familiar as his artifices might now have been to his
opponent, Almagro, with a credulity approaching to infatua-
tion, relied on his sincerity, and concluded an agreement on
there terms '.

about his brother's life, threw off every disguise which his con-
cern for it had obliged him to assume. The treaty was for-
gotten; pacific and conciliating measures were no more men-
tioned; it was in the field, he openly declared, and not in the
cabinet ; by arms, and not by negociation; that it must now be
determined who should be master of Peru. The rapidity of
his preparations suited such a decisive resolution. Seven hun-

mand of these was given to his two brothers, in whom he B o o K

could perfecly confide for the execution of his most violent -
schemes, as they were urged on not only by the enmity flow-
ing from family rivalfhip, but animated with the desire of
vengeance, excited by recolletlion of their recent disgrace and
sufferings. After an unsuccessful attempt to cross' the moun-
tains in the direCt road between Lima and Cuzco, they march-
ed towards the south along the coast as far as Nafca, and then
turning to the left, penetrated through the defiles in that branch
of the Andes which lay between them and the capital. Alma-
gro, inflead of hearkening to some of his officers, who advised
him to attempt the defence of those difficult pafls, waited the
approach of the enemy in the plain of Cuzco. Two rcafons
seem to have induced him to take this resolution. His followers
amounted hardly to five hundred, and he was afraid of weak-
ening such a feeble body, by fending any detachment towards
the mountains. His cavalry far exceeded that of the adverse
party, both in number and discipline, and it was only in an
open country that he could avail himself of that advantigc.

TH E Pizarros advanced without any obftrulion, but what li ay

arose from the nature of the defcrt and horrid regions through 'uzcL'"
which they marched. As oon as they reached the plain, both
fations were equally impatient to bring this long-protraced
contcfi to an ifluc. Though countrymen and friends, the sub-
iccs of the fame sovereign, and each witlI the royal flandard

rounded the plain in which they were drawn up, covered with
a vast multitude of Indians, aebled to enjoy the fjctcacle of
their mutual carnage, and prepared to attack whatever party
remained maicer of the field ; so fell and implacable was the

,,J one pacific counsel, not a ingle overture towards accommoda-

tion proceeded from either fide. Unfortunately for Almagro,
he was so worn out with the fatigucs of fcrvice, to which his
advanced age was unequal, that, at this crisis of his fate, lie
could not exert his wonted aivity; and lie was obliged to
commit the leading of his troops to Orgognez, who, though
an officer of great merit, did not pofcefs the fame ascendant
either over the pirit or afFecions of the soldiers, as the chief
whom they had long been accustomed to follow and revere.

April z6. TiHE conflic was fierce, and maintain ed by each party with
A'.elaL, equal courage. On the fide of Almnagro, were more veteran

boldiers, and a larger proportion of cavalry, but these were
counterbalanced by Pizarro's superiority in numbers, and by
two companies of well-difciplined muketeers, which, on re-
ceiving an account of the infurredion of the Indians, the em-
peror had sent from Spain m. As the ife of fire-arms was not
fiequent among the adventurers in America , haffily equipped
for service, at their own expence, this finall band of soldiers,
regularly trained and armed, was a novelty in Peru, and de-
cided the fate of the day. Wherever it advanced, the weight
of a heavy and well-fufiained fire bore down horse and foot
before it; and Orgognez, while he endeavoured to rally and
animate his troops, having received a dangerous wound, the
rout became general. The barbarity of the conquerors slaincd
the glory which they acquired by tis complete iiory. The
violcnce of civil rage hurried on fT)me to slaughter their country-
men with indiicriminatc cruelty; the ncannels of private rc-
vcngc infligated others to ingle out indlividiuls as the objcis

were maifacred in cold blood ; above a hundred and iury f!- '------
diers fell in the field; a large proportion, where thic nnnbcr of
combatants was few, and the heat of the contest soon over.
Almagro, though so feeble that he could not bear the mntion!
of a horse, had infifed on being carried in a litter to an cmi-
nence which overlooked the field of battle. From thence, in
the utinoft agitation of mind, he viewed the various move-
ments of both parties, and at last beheld the total defeat of hi:;
own troops, with all the paflionate indignation of a veteran
leader long accuflomed to viLory. I-e endeavoured to ave aindl t;ikn.
hiinfelf by flight, but was taken prisoner, and guarded with
the flriteft vigilance °.

THFE Indians, instead of executing the resolution which they

had formed, retired quietly after the battle was over; and in
the history of the New World, there is not a more friking in-
fiance of the wonderful ascendant which the Spaniards had
acquired over its inhabitants, than that after feeing one of the
contending parties ruined and dispersed, and the other weak-
ened and fatigued, they had not courage to fall upon their ene-
mies, when fortune presentcd an opportunity of attacking them

' ---' fall below the high ideas of the recompence which they con-

j538. ceived to be due to their merit, that Ferdinand Pizarro, unable

to gratify such extravagant expetations, had recourse to the
fame expedient which his brother had employed on a similar
occasion, and endeavoured to find occupation for this turbulent
assuming spirit, in order to prevent it from breaking out into
open mutiny. With this view, he encouraged his most ac-
tive officers to attempt the discovery and reduction of various
provinces which had not hitherto fabmitted to the Spaniards.
To every flandard erected by the leaders who undertook any of
those new expeditions, volunteers resorted with the ardour and
hope peculiar to the age. Several of Almagro's soldiers joined
them, and thus Pizarro had the fatisfadion of being delivered
both from the importunity of his discontented friends, and the
dread of his ancient enemies .

Almagro ALMAGRO himself remained for several months in cultody,
tried,

under all the anguish of fufpence. For although his doom was
determined by the Pizarros from the moment that he fell into
their hands, prudence confirained them to defer gratifying
their vengeance, until the soldiers who had served under him,
as well as several of their own followers in whom they could not
perfectly confide, had left Cuzco. As soon as they set out upon
their different expeditions, Almagro was impeached of treason,
condemned, formally tried, and condemned to die. The sentence aftonilhed

him, and though he had often braved death with an undaunted
spirit in the field, its approach under this ignominious form
appalled him so much, that he had recourse to abject fupplica-

zarros to remember the ancient friendship between their brother
and him, and how much he had contributed to the ficcefs and 3
prosperity of their family; he reminded them of the humanity
with which, in opposition to the repeated remonfirances of his
own most attached friends, he had spared their lives when he had
them in his power; he conjured them to pity his age and infir-
mities, and to susser him to pass the wretched remainder of his
days in bewailing his crimes, and in making his peace with
Heaven. The intreaties, fays a Spanish historian, of a man so
much beloved, touched many an unfeeling heart, and drew tears
from many a hard eye. But the brothers remained inflexible.
As soon as Almagro knew his fate to be inevitable, he met it with
the dignity and fortitude of a veteran. He was firangled in and put to
prison, and afterwards publicly beheaded. He suffered in the
feventy-fifth year of his age, and left one son by an Indian wo-
man of Panama, whom, though at that time a prisoner in Li-
ma, he named as successor to his government, pursuant to a
power which the emperor had granted him '.

B 00 K and exaggeration of party hatred. Ferdinand Pizarro, who ar-
---'-- ' rived soon after, and appeared in court with extraordinary

splendor, endeavoured to efface the imprefion which their ac-
cufations had made, and to justify his brother and himself by
representing Almagro as the aggressor. The emperor and his
ministers, though they could not pronounce which of the con-
tending factions was mofl criminal, clearly discerned the fatal
tendency of their dissensions. It was obvious, that while the
leaders, entrufled with the conduc of two infant colonies, em-
ployed the arms which hould have been turned against the com-
mon enemy, in destroying one another, all attention to the public.
good must cease, and there was reason to dread that the Indians
might improve the advantage which their disunion presented to-,
them, and extirpate both the viCors and the vanquilhed. But the-
evil was more apparent than the remedy. Where the informa-
tion which had been received was so defeaive and suspicious,
and the scene of ation so remote, it was almost impossible to-
chalk out the line of conduct that ought to be followed; and be-
fore any plan that hould be approved of in Spain could be car-.
ried into execution, the situation of the parties, and the cir-
cumftances of affairs, might alter so entirely as to render its
effects extremely pernicious.

Vaca deCa- NOTHING therefore remained but to fend a person to Peru,
llrero nt tl'- vetied with extenflve and discretionary power, who, after view-
pie poers. ing deliberately the poflure of affairs with his own eyes,

and enquiring upon the spot, into the condui of the dif-
ferent leaders, should be authorised to eflablilh the govern-
ment in that form which he deemed molt conducive to the
interefl of the parent state, and the welfare of the colony. The
man fclecd for this important charge was Chrifnoval Vaca de

and his abilities, integrity, and firmness, juflified the choice. -----'
His inftrutions, though ample, were not such as to fetter him 5
in his operations. According to the different aspec of affairs,
he had power to take upon him different characters. If he
found the governor still alive, he was to assume only the title
of judge, to maintain the appearance of acting in concert with
him, and to guard against giving any just cause of offence to a
man who had merited so highly of his country. But if Pi-
zarro was dead, he was entrusted with a commiifon that
he might then produce, by which he was appointed his fuc-
ceffor in the government of Peru. This attention to Pizarro,
however, seems to have flowed rather from dread of his power,
than from any approbation of his measures; for at the very
time that the court seemed so solicitous not to irritate him, his
brother Ferdinand was arrested at Madrid, and confined to a,
prison, where he remained above twenty years '.

that vast empire, proceeded to parcel out its territories among the
conquerors; and had this division been made with any degree of
impartiality, the extent of countrywhich he had to beflow was sis-
ficient to have gratified his friends, and to have gained his enemies.
But Pizarro conducted this tranfadion not with the equity and
candour of a judge attentive to discovcr and to reward merit,
but with the illiberal spirit of a party leader. Large difrids,
in parts of the country most cultivated and populous, were et

whom were many of the original adventurers to whose valour
and perseverance Pizarro was indebted for his success, were
totally excluded from any portion in those lands, towards the ac-
quifition of which they had contributed so largely. As the vanity
of every individual set an immoderate value upon his own ser-
vices, and the idea of each concerning the recompence due to
them rose gradually to a more exorbitant height in proportion as
their conquefls extended, all who were disappointed in their expec-
tations exclaimed loudly against the rapaciousness and partiality
of the governor. The partisans of Almagro murmured in secret,
and meditated revenge '.

Progrefsof RAPID as the progress of the Spaniards in South America
theSpani had been since Pizarro landed in Peru, their avidity of do-

minion was not yet satisfied. The officers to whom Ferdinand
Pizarro gave the command of different detachments, penetrated
into several new provinces, and though ome of them were ex-
posed to great hardships in the cold and barren regions of the
Andes, and others suffered distress not inferior amidfl the woods
and marfles of the plains, they made discoveries and conquests
which extended their knowledge of the country as well as added
to their power. Pedro de Valdivia re-affumed Almagro's
icheme of invading Chili, and notwithstanding the fortitude of
the natives in defending their poffeflions, made such progrcrs
in the conquer of the country, that he founded the city of
St. Jago, and gave a beginning to the eftablifhmient of the Spa-

nii dominion there". But of all the enterprizes undertaken B °o K
about this period, that of Gonzalo Pizarro was the most re- --
markable. The governor, who seems to have resolved that no Remarkable
person in Peru should posess any Ilation of distinguished emi- epedition of
nence or authority but those of his own family, had deprived zao.
Benalcazar, the conqueror of Quito, of his command in that
kingdom, and appointed his brother Gonzalo to take the go-
vernment of it. He inftruded him to attempt the discovery
and conquest of the country to the east of the Andes, which,
according to the information of the Indians, abounded with cin-
namon and other valuable spices. Gonzalo, not inferior to any
of his brothers in courage, and no less ambitious of acquiring
diftindion, eagerly engaged in this difficult service. He set out
from Quito at the head of three hundred and forty soldiers,
near one half of whom were horsemen, with four thousand In-
dians to carry their provisions. In forcing their way through
the defiles, or over the ridges of the Andes, excess of cold and
fatigue, to neither of which they were accustomed, proved fa-
tal to the greater part of their wretched attendants. The rIardnfips
Spaniards, though more robust, and inured to a variety of they endure.
climates, suffered considerably, and loft some men; but when
they descended into the low country their distress increased.
During two months it rained incessantly, without any interval
of fair weather long enough to dry their cloaths . The vast
plains upon which they were now entering, either altogether
without inhabitants, or occupied by the rudest and least in-
duflrious tribes in the New World, yielded little subsistence.
They could not advance a flep but as they cut a road through
woods, or made it through marfles. Such incessant toil, and

B O 0 I continual scarcity of food, seem more than sufficient to have

Vi.

--- exhausted and dispirited any troops. But the fortitude and

perseverance of the Spaniards in the 'sixteenth century were in-
superable. Allured by frequent btit false accounts of rich coun-
tries before them, they persisted in firuggling on, until they
reached the banks of the Coca or Napo, one of the large rivers
whose waters pour into the Maragnon, and contribute to its
grandeur. There, with infinite labour, they built a bark,
which they expected would prove of great utility, both in con-
veying them over rivers, in procuring provisions, and in ex-
ploring the country. This was manned with fifty soldiers,
under the command of Francis Orellana, the officer next in
rank to Pizarro. The fiream carried them down with such
rapidity, that they were soon far a head of their countrymen,
who followed slowly and with difficulty by land.

Deserted by AT this dirance from his commander, Orellana, a young
Orelldna. man of an aspiring mind, began to fancy himself independent,

and transported with the predominant passion of the age, he
formed the scheme of distinguishing himself as a discoverer, by
following the course of the Maragnon, until it joined the ocean;
and by surveying the vast regions through which it flows.
This:fcheme of Orellana's was as bold as it was treacherous.
For, if he be chargeable with the guilt of having violated his
duty to his commander, and with having abandoned his fellow-
soldiers in a pathlefs.defert, where they had hardly any hopes of
success, or even offafety, but what were founded on the service
which theyexpefted fiom the bark; his crime is, in some measure,
balanced by the glory of having ventured, upon a navigation of
near two thousand leagues, through unknown nations, in a veflel
baflily conltrulted, with grecn timber, and by very unskilful

hands,
i14

hands, without provisions, without a compass, or a pilot. But B o O K
his courage and alacrity supplied every defect. Committing v-
himself fearlessly to the guidance of the fiream, the Napo Sailsdown the
bore hinm along to the fouth,iuntil he reached the great channel. Maragnon..
of the Maragnon. Turning with it towards the coast, he held.
on his course in that direjion. He made frequent descents o.
both fides of tle river, sometimes seizing by force of arms the
provisions of the fierce savages feated on its banks; and ometimes
procuring a supply of food by a friendly intercourse with more'
gentle tribes. After a long series of dangers which he encoun-
tered with amazing fortitude, and of distresses which he sup-
ported with no lefsmagnanimity, he reached the ocean", where ..
new perils awaited him. These he likewise surmounted, and.
got safe to the Spanifl settlement in the ifand Cubagua, from
thence he failed to Spain. The vanity natural to travellers
who visit regions unknown to the reft of mankind, and the.
art of an adventurer, solicitous to magnify his own merit,.
concurred in prompting him. to mingle an extraordinary pro-
portion of the marvellous in the narrative of his voyage. He
pretended to have difcovcred nations so rich, that the roofs of
their temples were. covered with plates. of gold; and described
a republic of women so warlike and powerful, as.to have ex-
tended their dominion over a considerable tra. of the fertile:
plains which he had visited. Extravagant as tliofe tales were,
they gave rife to an opinion, that a region abounding with gold,

and his followers perceived at once their own desperate situation,
when deprived of their only resource. The spirit of the flouteft

back instantly. Pizarro, though he assumed an appearance of
tranquillity, did not oppose their inclination. But he was now
twelve hundred miles from Quito; and in that long march the
Spaniards encountered hardships greater than those they had en-
dured in their progress outward, without the alluring hopes

Four thousand Indians, and two hundred and ten Spaniards pe-

near two years; and as fifty men were aboard the bark with
Orellana, only fourscore got back to Quito. These were naked

confidering themselves as proscribed by the party in power, no
longer entertained any hope of bettering their condition. Great
numbers in despair resorted to Lima, where the house of young
Almagro was always open to them, and the slender portion of
his father's fortune, which the governor allowed him to enjoy,
was spent in affording them subsistence. The warm attach-

at the head of eighteen of the most determined conspirators,
rallied out of Almagro's house in complete armour; and draw-
ing their swords, as they advanced hastily towards the governor's
palace, cried out, " Long live the king, but let the tyrant die."
Their associates, warned of their motions by a signal, were in
arms at different fatiions ready to support them. Though
Pizarro was usually frrounded by such a numerous train of
attendants as suited the magnificence of the most opulent sub-
jet of the age in which he lived, yet as he was just risen from
table, and most of his domestics had retired to their own apart-
ments, the conspirators passed through the two outer courts of
the palace unobserved. They were at the bottom of the stair-
cafe, before a page in waiting could give the alarm to his
master, who was converting with a few friends in a large hall.
The governor, whose fleddy mind no form of danger could ap-
pal, starting up, called for arms, and commanded Francisco de
Chaves to make fast the door. But that officer, who did not
retain so much presence of mind as to obey this prudent order,
running to the top of the flair-cafe, wildly asked the confpira-
tors what they meant, and whither they were going. Instead
of answering, they stabbed him to the heart, and burlt into the
hall. Some of the persons who were there threw themselves
from the windows; others attempted to fly; and a few draw-

with no other arms than his fworcd and buckler, defended the
entry, and fipported by his half-brother Alcantara, and his
little knot of friends, he maintained the unequal contest with
intrepidity worthy of his pafi exploits, and with the vigour of
a youthful combatant. " Courage, cried he, companions, we
are yet enow to make those traitors repent of their audacity."
But the armour of the conspirators protected them, while every
thruit they made took effea. Alcantara fell dead at his brother's
feet; his other defenders were mortally wounded. The gover-
nor, so weary that he could hardly wield his sword, and no
longer ableto parry the many weapons furioully aimed at him,
received a deadly thrust full in his throat, funk to the ground,

together with the houses of several of his adherents, were

THE boldness and success of the conspiracy, as well as the B ,00 K

his standard. Every adventurer of desperate fortune, all who Ne,, appear-

of his government in the latter years of his life, the number of
malcontents was considerable, declared without hesitation, in
favour of Almagro, and he was soon at the head of eight
hundred of the most gallant veterans in Peru. As his youth
and inexperience dilqualified him from taking the command
of them himself, he appointed Herrada to a as general. But
though Almagro speedily colleced such a respectable force,
the acquicfcence in his government was far from being general.
IPizarro had left many friends to whom his memory was dear;
the barbarous assassination of a man to whom his country was
so highly indebted, filled every impartial person with horror.
The ignominious birth of Almagro, as well as the doubtful
title on which he founded his pretensions, led others to con-
fider him as an usurper. Tle officers who commanded in
some provinces refused to recognize his authority, until it was
confirmed by the emperor. In others, particularly at Cuzco,
the royal fiandard was erected, and preparations made to re-
venge the murder of their ancient leader.

THOSE feeds of discord, which could not hlave lain long dor- Arival or

Vaca de Cafiro was known. After a long and difaNirous voy-

peror in Popayan, and by Pedro de Puelles, who, in the
absence of Gonzalo Pizarro, had the command of the troops
left in Quito. Vaca de Cafiro not only assumed the supreme
authority, but hewed that he poffefred the talents' which the
exercise of it at that jundure required. By his influence
and address he soon assembled such a body of troops, as not
only set him above all fear of being exposed to any insult from
the adverse party, but enabled him to advance from Quito with
the dignity that became his character. By dispatching persons
of confidence to the different settlements in Peru, with a formal
notification of his arrival and of his commission, he communi-
cated to his countrymen the royal pleasure with refpedc to the
government of the country. By private emiflaries, he excited
such officers as had discovered their disapprobation of Almagro's
proceedings, to manifest their duty to their sovereign by sup-
porting the person honoured with his commission. Those mea-
fures were productive of great effecs. Encouraged by the ap-
proach of the new governor, or prepared by his machinations,
the loyal were confirmed in their principles, and avowed them
with greater boldnes; the timid ventured to declare their fen-
timents; the neutral and wavering, finding it necessary to chufe
a fide, began to lean to that which now appeared to be the safest
as well as the most just .

to it before the arrival of Vaca de Castro, he set out at the head B O O K
of his troops for Cuzco, where the most considerable body of -
opponents had erected the royal standard, under the commiand 542'
of Pedro Alvarez Holguin. During his march thither, Her-
rada, the skilful guide of his youth and of his counsels, died;
and from that time his measures were conspicuous for their
violence, but concerted with little sagacity, and executed with
no address. Holguin, with forces far inferior to those of the
opposite party, was descending towards the coast at the very
time that Almagro was on his way to Cuzco. By a very simple
stratagem, he deceived his unexperienced adversary, avoided
an engagement, and effected a juncion with Alvarado, an of-
sicer of note, who had been the first to declare against Almagro
as an usurper.

SOON after, Vaca de Castro entered the camp with the troops Progress of

which he brought from Quito, and ereting the royal standard Vataode
before his own tent, he declared, that, as governor, he would
discharge in person all the funcions of general of their com-
bined forces. Though formed by the tenour of his past life to
the habits of a sedentary and pacific profession, he at once as-
fumed the activity and discovered the decision of an officer long
accufiomed to command. Knowing his trength to be now far
superior to that of the enemy, he was impatient to terminate
the contest by a battle. Nor did the followers of Almagro,
who had no hopes of obtaining pardon for a crime so atrocious
as the murder of the governor, decline that mode of decision.
They met at Chupas, about two hundred miles from Cuzco, Sept. 16..
and fought with all the fierce animosity inspircd by the violence
of civil rage, the rancour of private enmity, the cagerness of
revenge, and the last efforts of dcflair. Victory, after re-

DURING those violent convulsions in Peru, the emperor and Consultations

all their settlements in the New World. Rapid and extensive
as the Spanish conquefis in America had been, they were not
carried on by any regular exertion of the national force, but
by the occasional efforts of private adventurers. After fitting
out a few of the first armaments for discovering new regions,
the court of Spain, during the bury reigns of Ferdinand and of
Charles V. the former the most intriguing prince of the age,
and the latter the most ambitious, was encumbered with such
a multiplicity of schemes, and involved in war with so many
nations of Europe, that it had not leisure to attend to dillant
and less interesting objets. The care of prosecuting discovery,
or of attempting conquest, was abandoned to individuals;
and with such ardour did men push forward in this new
career, on which novelty, the spirit of adventure, avarice,
ambition, and the hope of meriting heaven, prompted themn
with combined influence to enter, that in lets than half a cen-
tury almost the whole of that extensive empire which Spain
now pofferes in the New World, was fubjcded to its dominion.
As the Spanilh court contributed nothing towards the various
expeditions undertaken in America, it was not intitled to claim
much from their success. Tle sovereignty of the conquered
provinces, with the fifth of the gold and silver, was reserved

I,'4Z fcrved to indemnify them for what they had expended in

equipping themselves for the service, and the conquered ter-
ritory was divided among them, according to rules which cuf-
tom had introduced, as permanent establishments which their
successful valour merited. In the infancy of those settlements,
when their extent as well as their value were unknown, many
irregularities escaped observation, and it was found necessary
to connive at many excefles. The conquered people were pil-
laged with deltrudive rapacity, and their country parcelled out
among its new mailers in exorbitant hares, far exceeding the
highest recompence due to their services. 1 he rude conquerors
of America, incapable of forming their eftablihments upon any
general or extensive plan of policy, attentive only to private
interest, unwilling to forego present gain from the profped of
remote or public benefit, seem to have had no object but to
amass sudden wealth,' without regarding what might be the
consequences of the means by which they acquired it. But
when time at length discovered to the Spanish court the im-
portance of its American poffefions, the neceflity of new-
modelling their whole frame became obvious, and in place of
the maxims and pracices prevalent among military adven--
turers, it was found requisite to fubflitute the institutions of
regular government.

ONE evil in particular called for an immediate remedy.

The conquerors of Mexico and Peru imitated the fatal example
of their countrymen fctiled in the islands, and employed them-
selves in searching for gold and silver with the fame inconfidcratc
cagernefs. Similar effects followed. The natives employed in

this
226

this labour by mailers, who in imposing their tasks had no re- B O K
gard either to what they felt or to what they were able to per-
form, pined away and perished so fafl, that there was reason -4z
to apprehend that Spain, intfead of possessing countries peopled
to such a degree as to be susceptible of progressive improvement,
would oon remain proprietor only of a vail uninhabited defart.

THE emperor and his ministers were so sensible of this, and

so solicitous to prevent the extinction of the Indian race, which
threatened to render their acquisitions of no value, that from
time to time various laws, which I have mentioned, had been
made for securing to that unhappy people more gentle and
equitable treatment. But the distance of America from the
feat of empire, the fecblenefs of government in the new colo-
nies, the avarice and audacity of soldiers unaccustomed to re-
itraint, prevented there salutary regulations from operating with
any considerable influence. The evil continued to grow, and
at this time the emperor found an interval of leisure from the
affairs of Europe to take it into attentive consideration. He The perSons

council of the Indies, but called upon several persons who had
resided long in the New World, to aid them with the result of
their experience and observation. Fortunately for the people
of America, among these was Bartholomew de las Casas, who
happened to be then at Madrid on a milion from a chapter of
his order at Chiapa'. Though, since the miscarriage of his
former schemes for the relief of the Indians, he had continued
flhut up in his cloiflcr, or occupied in religious functions, his
zeal in behalf of the former oljes of his pity was so far from
abating, that, from an increased knowledge of their sufferings,

Gg its

B 0 0 K its ardour had augmented. He seized eagerly this opportunity

Vt. .-.--.j of reviving his favourite maxims concerning the treatment of
J542. the Indians. With the moving eloquence natural to a man on

whose mind the scenes which he had beheld had made a deep
impression, he described the irreparable waste of the human
species in the New World, the Indian race almost totally swept
away in the islands in less than fifty years, and hastening to
extincion on the continent with the fame rapid decay. With
the decisive tone of one firongly prepossessed with the truth of
his own system, he imputed all this to a single cause, to the
exations and cruelty of his countrymen, and contended that
nothing could prevent the depopulation of America, but the
declaring 'f its natives to be freemen, and treating them as
fubjeds, not as slaves. Nor did he confide for the success of
this popofal in the powers of his oratory alone. In order to
enforce them, he compoed his famous treatise concerning the
deftru&ion of America , in which he relates, with many hor-
rid circumstances, but with apparent marks of exaggerated de-
scription, the devastation of every province which had been
visited by the Spaniards.

His olicitude THE emperor was deeply affliaed with the recital of so many
to introduce
ageneralre- acions shocking to humanity. But as his views extended far
formation of beyond those of Las Casas, he perceived that relieving the In-
government.

dians from oppression was but one ftep towards rendering his
poffefions in the New World a valuable acquisition, and would
be of little avail, unless he could circumscribe the power and
usurpations of his own fubjets there. The conquerors of
America, however great their merit had been towards their
country, were mofily persons of such mean birth, and of fich
abject rank in focicty, as give no diftintion in the eye of a

monarch. The exorbitant wealth with which some of them B O O K
returned, gave umbrage to an age not accustomed to fee men in
inferior condition elevated above their level, and rising to emu- '
late or to surpass the ancient nobility in splendour. The ter-
ritories which their leaders had appropriated to themselves were
of enormous extent '; and if the country hould ever be im-
proved in proportion to the fertility of the foil, they muff grow
too wealthy and too powerful for fubjecs. It appeared to
Charles, that this abuse required a remedy no less than the
other, and that the regulations concerning both must be en-
forced by a mode of government more vigorous than had yet
been introduced into America.

WITH this view he framed a body of laws, containing many New regula-

salutary appointments with refpet to the conflitution and powers riurpof tili
of the supreme council of the Indies; concerning the station
and jurifdidion of the royal audiences in different parts of Ame-
rica, the administration of justice, the order of government,
both ecclesiastical and civil. These were approved of by all
ranks of men. But together with them were iflued the fol-
lowing regulations, which excited universal alarm, and occa-
sioned the most violent convulsions :-" That as the reparti-
mientos or hares of land seized by several persons appeared to
be exceflive, the royal audiences are empowered to reduce them
to a moderate extent: That upon the death of any conqueror
or planter, the lands and Indians granted to him shall not de-
scend to his widow or children, but return to the crown: That
the Indians hall henceforth be exempted from personal service,
and (hal-l not be compelled to carry the baggage of travellers, to
labour in the mines, or to dive in the pearl fisheries: That the

sices, ecclefiaflics of every denomination, hospitals and mona-
fteries, shall be deprived of the lands and Indians allotted to
them, and these be annexed to the crown: That every person
in Peru, who had any criminal concern in the contefls between
Pizarro and Almagro, hould forfeit his lands and Indians i."'

His minifiers ALL the Spanish miniflers who had hitherto been entrufled
remnionlrate
againlu them. with the direction of American affairs, and who were belt ac-

quainted with the fRate of the country, remonstrated against
those regulations, as ruinous to their infant colonies. They
represented, that the number of Spaniards who had hitherto
emigrated to the New World was so extremely small, that no-
thing could be expected from any effort of theirs towards im-
proving the vast regions over which they were scattered; that
the success of every scheme for this purpose must depend upon
the ministry and service of the Indians, whose native indolence
and averfon to labour, no profped of benefit or promise of
reward could surmount; that the moment the right of im-
posing a tafi, and exacting the performance of it, was taken
from their matiers, every work of industry must cease, and all
the sources from which wealth begun to pour in upon Spain
mufl be tfopt for ever. But Charles, tenacious at all times of
his own opinions, and so much impressed at present with the
view of the diolrders which reigned in America, that he was
willing to hazard the application even of a dangerous remedy,
perfifled in his resolution of publifling the laws. That they
might be carried into execution with greater vigour and au-

was viewed as the prelude of general ruin. The unlimited
grant of liberty to the Indians affected every Spaniard in Ame-
rica without diflinflion, and there was hardly one who might
not on some pretext be included under the other regulations,
and flffer by them. But the colony in New Spain had now
been so long accuflomed to the refiraints of law and authority
under the tedy and prudent administration of Mendoza, that
how much soever the 1firit of the new statutes was detested and

of men whose abilities and integrity intitled them to decide
concerning what fell immediately under their own view, granted
such a relaxation of the rigour of the laws as re-eftabliflled the
colony in its former tranquillity '.
In Peru. IN Peru the torm gathered with an aspea fill more fierce

and threatening, and was not so oon dispersed. The conquer-
ors of Peru, of a rank much inferior to those who had sub-
jeated Mexico to the Spanish crown, farther removed from the
infpedion of the parent Rate, and intoxicated with the sudden
acquisition of wealth, carried on all their operations with greater
licence and irregularity than any body of adventurers in the
New World. Amidst the general subversion of law and order,
occasioned by two fuccefive civil wars, when each individual
was at liberty to decide for himself, without any guide but his
own interest or passions, this turbulent spirit rose above all sense
of subordination. To men thus corrupted by anarchy, the in-
troduction of regular government, the power of a viceroy, and
the authority of a refpedable court of judicature, would have
appeared formidable restraints, to which they would have sub-
mitted with reluctance. But they revolted with indignation
against the idea of complying with laws, by which they were
to be stripped at once of all they had earned so hardly during
many years of service and suffering. As the account of the

he landed at Tunbez, Nugnez Vela seems to have confidered B C l0
himself merely as an executive officer, without any discretionary
power; and, regardless of whatever he observed or heard con- 1s4+
cerning the Rate of the country, he adhered to the letter of the
regulations with unrelenting rigour. In all the towns through
which he passed, the natives were declared to be free, every
person in public office was deprived of his lands and servants;
and as an example of obedience to others, he would not susser
a single Indian to be employed in carrying his baggage in his
march towards Lima. Amazement and consternation went be-
fore him as he approached; and so little solicitous was he to
prevent them from augmenting, that on entering the capital, he
openly avowed that he came to obey the orders of his sovereign,
not to dispense with his laws. This harsh declaration was ac-
companied with what rendered it ill more intolerable, haugh-
tiness in deportment, a tone of arrogance and decision in dif-
course, and an insolence of office grievous to men little accuf-
tomed to hold civil authority in high refped. Every attempt
to procure a suspension or mitigation of the new laws, the
viceroy confidered as flowing from a spirit of difaffetion that
tended to rebellion. Several persons of rank were confined,
and some put to death, without any form of trial. Vaca de
Caflro was arrefled, and notwithstanding the dignity of his
former rank, and his merit in having prevented a general in-
lIrredtion in the colony, he was loaded with chains, and shut
up in the common jail °.

dire& their efforts. From the time that the purport of the new
iegulations was known in Peru, every Spaniard there turned
his eyes towards Gonzalo Pizarro, as the only person able to
avert the ruin with which they threatened the colony. From
all quarters, letters and addresses were sent to him, conjuring
him to stand forth as their common protecor, and offering to
support him in the attempt with their lives and fortunes.
Gonzalo, though inferior in talents to his other brothers,
was equally ambitious, and of courage no less daring. The
behaviour of an ungrateful court towards his brothers and him-
self, dwelt continually on his mind, Ferdinand a llate prisoner
in Europe, the children of the governor in custody of the vice-
roy, and sent aboard his fleet, himself reduced to the condition
of a private citizen in a country, for the discovery and conquest
of which Spain was indebted to his family. There thoughts
prompted him to seek for vengeance, and to assert the rights
of his family, of which he now confidered himself as the guar-
dian and the heir. But as no Spaniard can easily surmount
that veneration for his sovereign which is interwoven in his
frame, the idea of marching in arms against the royal standard
filled him with horror. He hesitated long, and was flill unre-
solved, when the violence of the viceroy, the universal call of
his countrymen, and the certainty of becoming soon a victim
himself to the severity of the new laws, moved him to quit his
residence at Chuquifaca de la Plata, and repair to Cuzco. All
the inhabitants went out to meet him, and received him with
rranfports of joy, as the deliverer of the colony. In the fervour
of their zeal, they eleded him procurator general of the Spa-

5 nifh

They authorised him to lay their remonflrances before the royal I---.._
audience in Lima, and upon pretext of danger from the In- '544'
dians, authoried him to march thither in arms. Under fanc-
tion of this nomination Pizarro took pofeffion of the royal
treasure, appointed officers, levied soldiers, seized a large train
of artillery which Vaca de Castro had deposited in Guamanga,
and set out for Lima, as if he had been advancing against a
public enemy. Difaffedion having now assumed a regular
form, and being united under a chief of such a distinguished
name, many persons of note resorted to his standard; and a
considerable part of the troops raised by the viceroy to oppose
his progress, deserted to him in a body P.

The'vi4croy judges at length prevailed. The viceroy, universally odious,

until he could be ent home to Spain.
Views of Pi- THE judges, in consequence of this, having assumed the fu-

zaro preme direaion of affairs into their own hands, issued a procla-

mation fifpending the execution of the obnoxious laws, and
sent a meflage to Fizarro, requiring him, as they had already
granted whatever he could request, to difnifs his troops, and to
repair to ima with fifteen or twenty attendants. They could
hardly expect that a man so daring and ambitious would tamely
comply with this requisition. It was made, probably, with no
such intention, but only to throw a decent veil over their own
conduct; for Cepeda, the president of the court of audience, a
pragmatical and aspiring lawyer, seems to have held a secret
correspondence with Pizarro, and; had already formed the plan,
which he afterwards executed, of devoting himself to: his ser-
vice. The imprisonment of the viceroy, the usurpation of the
judges, together with the universal confusion and anarchy con-
sequent upon events so singular and unexpected, opened new
and vast profpeds to Pizarro. He now beheld the supreme
power within his reach. Nor did he want courage to puil on
towards the objec which fortune presented to his view. Car-
vajal, the prompter of his resolutions, and guide of all his
adions, had long fixed his eye upon it as tie only end at
which Pizarro ought to aim. Inflead of the inferior funcion
of procurator for the Spanish settlements in Peru, he openly
demanded to be governor and captain general of the whole pro-

mission to that effect. At the head of twelve hundred men, -.-
within a mile of Lima, where there was neither leader nor '544.
army to oppose him, such a request carried with it the authority
of a command. But the judges, either from unwillingness to
relinquish power, or from a desire of preserving ome attention
to appearances, hesitated, or seemed to hesitate, about comply-
ing. Carvajal, impatient of delay, and impetuous in all his Heaflumes
operations, marched into the city by night, seized several offi- 'eg.v"
cers of diftinCEion obnoxious to Pizarro, and hanged them with-
out the formality of a trial. Next morning the court of au-
dience issued a commission in the emperor's name, appointing
Pizarro governor of Peru, with full powers, civil as well as
military, and he entered the town that day with extraordinary
pomp, to take possession of his new dignityr.

Diego Centeno, a bold and aive officer, exasperated by
the cruelty and oppression of Pizarro's lieutenant-governor in

cut him off, and declared for the viceroy '.

against him certed. He prepared to assert the authority to which he had

attained, with the spirit and conduct of an officer accutomed
to command, and marched diretly against the viceroy as the
enemy who was nearest as well as most formidable. As he was
master of the public revenues in Peru, and molt of the military
men were attached to his family, his troops were so numerous,
that the viceroy, unable to face them, retreated towards Quito.

had scarcely reached Quito, when the van-guard of Pizarro's

was as hardy and ative as any young soldier under his com-
mand. Nugnez Vela instantly abandoned a town incapable of
defence, and with a rapidity more resembling a flight than a
retreat, marched into the province of Popayan. Pizarro conti-
nued to pursue, but finding it impossible to overtake him, re-
turned to Quito. From thence he dispatched Carvajal to op-
pole Centeno, who was growing formidable in the southern
provinces of the empire, and he himself remained there to make

had from the beginning warned Pizarro, that in the career on
which he was entering, it was vain to think of holding a
middle course; that he muff either boldly aim at all, or attempt
nothing. From the time that Pizarro obtained possession of
the government of Peru, he inculcated the fame maxim with
greater earnestness. Upon receiving an account of the victory
at Quito, he remonstrated with him in a tone frill more per-
emptory. " You have usurped (said he, in a letter written to
Pizarro on that occasion) the supreme power in this country,
in contempt of the emperor's commiflion to another. You
have marched, in hoflile array, against the royal standard;
you have attacked the reprefentativc of your sovereign in the
field, have defeated him, and cut off his head. Think not that
ever a monarch will forgive such insults on his dignity, or that
any reconciliation with him can be cordial or sincere. De-
pend no longer on the precarious favour of another. Assume
yourself the sovereignty over a country, to the dominion of
which your family has a title founded on the rights both of
discovery and conquest. It is in your power to attach every
Spaniard in Peru of any consequence inviolably to your inte-
reft by liberal grants of lands and of Indians, or by infti-
tuting ranks of nobility, and creating titles of honour similar
to those which are courted with so much cagernefs in Europe.
By eftablilhing orders of knighthood, with privileges and
diftinaions resembling those in Spain, you may beflow a gra-
tification upon the officers in your fervicc, suited to the ideas of
military men. Nor is it to your countrymen only that you
ought to attend; endcavour to gain the natives. By nimay-
ing the Coya, or daughter of the Sun next in fiicceffion to tile

B 0 0 I crown, you will induce the Indians, out of veneration for the

V[.
----' blood of their ancient princes, to unite with the Spaniards in
1546. support of your authority. Thus, at the head of the princi-

pal inhabitants of Peru, as well as of the new settlers there,
you may set at defiance the power of Spain, and repel with
ease any feeble force which it can fend at such a dftance."
Cepeda, the lawyer, who was now Pizarro's confidential coun-
fellor, warmly seconded Carvajal's exhortations, and employed
whatever learning he possessed in demonfirating, that all the
founders of great monarchies had been raised to pre-eminence,
not by the antiquity of their lineage, or the validity of their
rights, but by their own enterprising valour and personal
merit .

But chufes to PIZARRO listened attentively to both, and could not conceal

with the court the fatisfadion with which he contemplated the objec that
of Spain. they presented to his view. But happily for the tranquillity of

the world, few men possess that superior firength of mind,
and extent of abilities, which are capable of forming and exe-
cuting such daring schemes, as cannot be accomplished with-
out overturning the eftablilhed order of society, and violating
those maxims of duty which men are accustomed to hold
sacred. The mediocrity of Pizarro's talents circumscribed his
ambition within more narrow limits. Instead of aspiring at
independent power, he confined his views to the obtaining fromn
the court of Spain a confirmation of the authority which he
now poufeffed; and for that purpose, he sent an officer of
diftinaion thither, to give such a representation of his con-

no less solicitude, concerning the measures which ought to be
pursued in order to re-establish the emperor's authority in
Peru. Though unacquainted with the last excefles of outrage to
which the malcontents had proceeded there, the court had re-
ceived an account of the insurrection againfl the viceroy, of
his imprisonment, and the usurpation of the government by
Pizarro. A revolution so alarming, called for an immediate
interposition of the emperor's abilities and authority. But as
he was fully occupied at that time in Germany, in condud-
ing the war against the famous league of Smalkalde, one of
the most interesting and arduous enterprises in his reign, the
care of providing a remedy for the disorders in Peru devolved
upon his son Philip, and the counfcllors whom Charles had ap-
pointed to aflift him in the government of Spain during his
absence. At first view, the actions of Pizarro and his adhe-
rents appeared so repugnant to the duty of fubjedts towards
their overeign, that the greater part of the ministers infifled
on declaring them instantly to be guilty of rebellion, and on
proceeding to punifl them with exemplary rigour. But when
the fervour of their zeal and indignation began to abate, innu-
merable obstaclcs to the execution of this measure prcfcnted
theinfelves. The veteran bands of infantry, the llcength and
glory of the Spanilh armies, were then employed in Germany.
Spain, exhaufled of men and money by a long fcries of wars,
in which she had been involved by the rcftlcls ambition of two

Ificccffivc

245

B 0 0 K successive monarchs, could not easily equip an armament of

v].
.--, --- sufficient force to reduce Pizarro. To transport any refpeaable

body of troops to a country so remote as Peru, appeared almost
impossible. While Pizarro continued master of the South-Sea,
the direC route by Nombre de Dios and Panama was impraci-
cable. An attempt to march to Quito by land through the new
kingdom of Granada, and the province of Popayan, across
regions of vast extent, desolate, unhealthy, or inhabited by
fierce and hostile tribes, would be attended with unfurmount-
able danger and hardships. The passage to the South-Sea
by the Straits of Magellan was so tedious, so uncertain,
and so little known in that age, that no confidence could be
placed in- any effort carried on in a course of navigation so
remote and precarious. Nothing then remained but to relin-
quifh the fyflem which the ardour of their loyalty had first
suggested, and to attempt by lenient measures what could not
be effeced by force. It was manifest from Pizarro's solicitude
to represent his conduct in a favourable light to the emperor,
that, notwithstanding the excesses of which he had been guilty,
he still retained sentiments of veneration for his sovereign. By
a proper application to there, together with some fich concef-
lions as should discover a spirit of moderation and forbearance
in government, he might be yet reclaimed, or the ideas of loy-
alty natural to Spaniards might so far revive among his fol-
lowers, that they would no longer lend their aid to uphold his
usurped authority.

as prcfdecnt. f the person to whom it fihold be committed. After weigh-

ing with much attention the comparative merit of various per-

song, the Spanish miniftcrs fixed with unanimity of choice, upon °O () K
Pedro de la Gafca, a prielt in no higher llation than tlat of coun-
iellor to the inquisition. Though in no public ollice, he had been 16.
occasionally employed by government in affairs of trust and con-
sequence, and had conducced them with no les skill than fuc-
cels; diflilaying a gentle and ininuiating temper, accompanied
with much iirmncls; probity, iuperior to any feeling of private
interest; and a cautious circumlnfpcion in concerting meaifres,
followed by such vigour in executing then, as is rarely found
in alliance with the other. These qualities marked him out
for the funation to which he was dcflined. The emlperor, to
whom Galca was not unknoswn,, warmly approved of the choice,
and communicated it to him in a letter, containing expressions
of good-will and confidence, no lces honourable to the prince
who wrote, than to the subjea who received it. Gafca, notwith-
standing his advanced age and feeble constitution, and tllougl,
from the apprehensions natural to a man, who, during the
course of his life, had never been out of his own country,
he dreaded the effets of a long voyage, and of an unhealthy
climate', did not hesitate a moment about complying with the
will of his sovereign. In order to shew that it was from tllis Ilis nodera-
principle alone that he aed, he refuced a bishopric which
was offered to him, in order that he might bear a more
dignified charaCter; he would accept of no higher title thani
that of prceident of the court of audiencc in Lima; and
declared tlat he would receive no salary on account of his

committed to
himn. refped to whatever related personally to himself, he demanded

his official powers in a very different tone. He insisted, as
he was to be employed in a country so remote from the feat of
government, where he could not have recourse to his sovereign
for new inftrudions on every emergence; and as the whole
fuccels of his negociations must depend upon the confidence
which the people with whom he had to treat could place in
the extent of his powers, that he ought to be invested with un-
limited authority, that his jurifdidion muff reach to all persons
and to all causes; that he muff be empowered to pardon, to pu-
nifh, or to reward, as circumfiances and the behaviour of dif-
ferent men might require; that, in cafe of refitance from the
malcontents, he might be authorised to reduce them to obedi-
ence by force of arms, to levy troops for that purpose, and to
call for affinance from the governors of all the Spanish fettle-
ments in America. These powers, though manifestly conducive
to the great objects of his mission, appeared to the Spanish
ministers to be inalienable prerogatives of royalty, which ought
not to be delegated to a subjea, and they refused to grant
them. But the emperor's views were more enlarged. As
from the nature of his employment, Gafca must be entrusted
with discretionary power in several points, and all his efforts
might prove ineffecual if he was circumscribed in any one

particular, Charles scrupled not to invest him with authority B 00
to the full extent that he demanded. Highly satisfied with this -
fresh proof of his mafler's confidence, Gafca haflencd his de-
parture, and without either money or troops, set out to quell a May z5-
formidable rebellion c.

ON his arrival at Nombre de Dios, he found EIernan Mexia, iuly, 2rri

an officer of note, polred there, by order of Pizarro, with a con- Panama.
fiderable body of men, to oppose the landing of any hostile
forces. But Gafca appeared in such pacific guise, with a train
io little formidable, and with a title of no such dignity as to
excite terror, that he was received with much rcfpec'. From
Nombre de Dios he advanced to Panama, and met with a fimi-
lar reception fronm linojofa, whom Pizarro had entrufled with
the government of that town, and the command of his fleet
fiationed there. In both places he held the fame language,
declaring that he was fcnt by their sovereign as a messenger
of peace, not as a miniller of vengeance; that he came to re-
dress all their grievances, to revoke the laws which had ex-
cited alarm, to pardon past offences, and to re-establish order
and jullice in the government of Peru. His mild deportment,
the simplicity of his manners, the fanciity of his profelion,
and a winning appearance of candour, gained credit to his
declarations. The veneration due to a person clothed witli
legal authority, and aing in virtue of a royal commiiflon,
began to revive among men accuflomed for lome time to no-
thling more rcfpcdable than an furped juiliciq:ion. Hinojofa,

at the fame time, an account of the nature of his commiflion,
and was informed that he offered to render every Spaniard in
Peru easy concerning what was past, by an at of general
oblivion; and secure with refped to the future, by repealing
the obnoxious laws; inflead of accepting with gratitude his
sovereign's gracious concessions, he was so much exasperated
on finding that he was not to be continued in his ftatibn
as governor of the country, that he instantly resolved to op-
pose the president's entry into Peru, and to prevent his ex-
ercifing any jurifdicdion there. To this desperate resolution
he added another as highly preposterous. He sent a new de-
putation to Spain to justify this conduEt, and to insist, in name
of all the communities in Peru, for a confirmation of the go-
vernment to himself during life, as the only means of pre-
serving tranquillity there. The persons entrufled with this
strange commillion, intimated the intention of Pizarro to the
president, and required him, in his name, to depart from Pa-
nama and return to Spain. They carried likewise secret in-
flru&ions to Hinojofa, direcing him to offer Gafca a present
of fifty thousand pesos, if le would comply voluntarily with
xvhat was demanded of him; and if he should continue obstinate,
to cut him off either by aaffination or poison'.

own demerit, he fufpeded that the emperor fludied only to de-
ceive him, and would never pardon the outrages which he had
committed. His chief confidents, no lets guilty, entertained
the fame apprehensions. The approach of Gafca without any
military force excited no terror. There were now above fix
thousand Spaniards fettled in Pcru ; and at the head of
these he doubted not to maintain his own independence, if the
court of Spain hould refuse to grant what he required. But
he knew not that a spirit of defection had already begun to
spread among those whom he trufled most. Hinojofa, amazed
at his precipitate resolution of setting himself in opposition to
the emperor's commission, and disdaining to be his infirument in
executing the odious crimes pointed out in his secret infiruc-
tions, publicly recognized the president as his only lawful fu-
perior. The officers under his command did the fame. Such
was the contagious influence of the example, that it reached
even the deputies who had been sent from Peru; and at the
time when Pizarro expected to hear either of Gafca's return to
Spain, or of his death, he received an account of his being
master of the fleet, of Panama, and of the troops flationed
there.

aaing as a judge in virtue of the royal commission, did not
scruple to proltitute the dignity of his funcion by finding Gafca
guilty of treason, and condemning him to death on that accountg.
Wild, and even ridiculous, as this proceeding was, it imposed
on the low illiterate adventurers, with whom Peru was filled,
by the semblance of a legal fandion warranting Pizarro to carry
on hoflilities against a convicted traitor. Soldiers accordingly
resorted from every quarter to his fandard, and he was soon
at the head of a thousand men, the bell equipped that had evor
taken the field in Peru.

Prcpaatcns GASCA, on his part, perceiving that force must be employed
of Gafca.

in order to accomplish the purpose of his miflion, was no less
afliduous in collecting troops from Nicaragua, Carthagena, and
other settlements on the continent; and with such success, that
he was soon in a condition to detach a squadron of his fleet,
April. with a considerable body of soldiers, to the coafi of Peru. Their

appearance excited a dreadful alarm; and though they did not
attempt for ome time to make any descent, they did more es-
fetual service, by setting ashore in different places persons who
dispersed copies of the aat of general indemnity, and the revo-
cation of the late edicts; and who made known every where the
pacific intentions, as well as mild temper, of the president.
The effet of spreading this information was wonderful. All
who were diflatisfied with Pizarro's violent administration, all
who retained any sentiments of fidelity to their overeign, be-

gan to meditate revolt. Some openly deserted a cause which B 00 K
they now deemed to be unjust. Centeno, leaving the cave in L.---
which he lay concealed, assembled about fifty of his former Infurreion
adherents, and with this feeble half-armed band advanced boldly of enteno;
to Cuzco. By a sudden attack in the night-time, in which he
displayed no less military kill than valour, he rendered him-
self mailer of that capital, though defended by a garrison of
five hundred men. Most of there having ranged themselves
under his banners, he had soon the command of a respectable
body of troops h.

trufled to the union of all Peru in his favour, was of a spirit
more undaunted, and more accustomed to the viciflitudes of
fortune, than to be disconcerted or appalled. As the danger
from Centeno's operations was the most urgent, he instantly
set out to oppose him. Having provided horses for all his fol-
diers, he marched with amazing rapidiry. But every morning
he found his force diminifled by numbers who had left him
during the night; and though he became ffilpicious to excess,
and punished without mercy all whom he fufpedcd, the rage
of desertion was too violent to be checked. Before he got

the molt obstinate and bloody that had hitherto been fought in
and defeats Peru. At length the intrepid valour of Pizarro, and the fupe-

riority of Carvajal's military talents, triumphed over numbers,
and obtained a complete vitory. The booty was immene ',
and the treatment of the vanquished cruel. By this signal
success the reputation of Pizarro was re-effabliflied, and being
now deemed invincible in the field, his army increased daily in
number k.

BUT events happened in other parts of Peru, which more

than counterbalanced the splendid vidory at Huaina. Pizarro
had scarcely left Lima, when the citizens, weary of his oppref-
five dominion, erected the royal tandard, and Aldana, with a
detachment of soldiers from the fleet, took possession of the
Gafca lands town. About the fame time', the president landed atTumbez

n Peru with five hundred men. Encouraged by his pretence, every

settlement in the low country declared for the king. The fitua-
tion of the two parties was now perfeEtly reverted; Cuzco and
the adjacent provinces were possessed by Pizarro; all the reft of
the empire, from Qtito southward, acknowledged the jurif-
didion of Gafca. As his numbers augmented fall, Gafca ad-
vanced into the interior part of the country. His behaviour
still continued to be gentle and unafluming; he expressed, on
every occasion, his ardent with of terminating the contest with-
out bloodshed. More solicitous to reclaim than to punifi, he

what was no less firiking. He himself, accompanied by the arch-

troop, his horfc, galloped off, and surrendered himself to the prefi-

dent. Garcilafo de la Vega, and other officers of note, fol-
lowed his example. The revolt of persons of such high rank
firuck all with amazement.. The mutual confidence on which
the union and strength of armies depend, ceased at once. Dif-
trust and contfernation spread from rank to rank. Some silent-
ly flipped away, others threw down their arms, the greatest
number went over to the royalists. Pizarro, Carvajal, and some
leaders, employed authority, threats, and entreaties to flop
them, but in vain. In less than half an hour, a body of men,
which might have decided the fate of the Peruvian empire, was
totally difpcrfed. Pizarro, feeing all. irretrievably loft, cried
out.in amazement to a few officers who fill faithfully adhered
to him, " What remains for us to do ?" " Let us rufl, re-

had not spirit to follow this soldiery counsel, and with a tame-
ness disgraceful to his former fame, he surrendered to one of
Gafca's officers. Carvajal, endeavouring to escape, was over-
taken and seized.

GASCA, happy in this bloodless vidory, did not slain it with

cruelty. Pizarro, Carvajal, and a finall number of the most
diflinguifhed or notorious offenders, were punifed capitally.
Pizarro was beheaded on the day after he surrendered. He sub-
mitted to his fate with a composed dignity, and eemed defi-
rous to atone by repentance for the crimes which he had com-
mitted. The end of Carvajal was suitable to his life. On his
trial he offered no defence. When the sentence adjudging him
to be hanged was pronounced, he carelessly replied, " One can
die but once." During the interval between the sentence and
execution, he discovered no sign either ofremorfe for the pafl, or
of solicitude about the future; scoffing at all who visited him, in
his usual sarcastic vein of mirth, with the fame quickness of re-
partee and gross pleasantry as at any other period of his life.
Cepeda, more criminal than either, ought to have shared the
fame fate; but the merit of having deserted his afiociates at
such a critical moment, and with such decisive effect, saved
him from immediate puniflment. He was sent, however, as
a prisoner to Spain, and died in confinement q.

leaders who contended for superiority, not one man aded as a
hired soldier, that follows his tfandard for pay. Every adven-
turer in Peru confidered himself as a conqueror, entitled, by
his services, to an establishment in that country which had been
acquired by his valour. In the contefis between the rival chiefs,
each chose his fide as he was directed by his own judgment or
affections. He joined his commander as a companion of his
fortune, and disdained to degrade himself by receiving the wages
of a mercenary. It was to their swords, not to pre-eminence in
office, or nobility of birth, that most of the leaders whom they
followed were indebted for their elevation; and each of their
adherents hoped, by the fame means, to open a way for him-
self to the possession of power and wealth '.

to divide the spoils of an opulent country, the desire of obtaining
wealth acquired incredible force. The ardour of pursuit aug-
mented in proportion to the hope of success. Where all were
intent on the fame objeCt, and under the dominion of the fame
passion, there was but one mode of gaining men, or of fecur-

by his early defetion from Pizarro, and surrender of the fleet
to Gafca, decided the fate of Peru, obtained a diftrid of country
affording two hundred thousand pesos of yearly value . While
such rewards were dealt out to the principal officers, with more
than royal munificence, proportional hares were conferred upon
those of inferior rank.

accustomed to hardship and toil, acquired of a sudden a taste
for profuse and inconsiderate dissipation, and indulged in all
the excesses of military licentioufniefs. The riot of low de-
bauchery occupied some; a relish for expensive luxuries spread
among others . The meanest soldier in Peru would have
thought himself degraded by marching on foot, and at a time

tures exeaedd upon the death of every opponent, shut the door
against mercy. To be wealthy, was of itfelffufficient to expose
a man to accusation, or to subjet him to punishment. On the
slightest suspicions, Pizarro condemned many of the most opu-
lent inhabitants in Peru to death. Carvajal, without searching
for any pretext to jufify his cruelty, cut off many more. The
number of those who suffered by the hand of the executioner,

were totally loft. During their diflenfions, there was hardly a i
Spaniard in Peru who did not abandon the party which he had 54
originally espoused, betray the afociates with whom he had
united, and violate the engagements under which lie had come.
The viceroy Nugnez Vela, was ruined by the treachery of
Cepeda and the other judges of the royal audience, who were
bound by the duties of their function to have supported his au-
thority. The chief advisers and companions of Gonzalo Pizar-
ro's revolt, were the first to forsake him, and submit to his ene-
mies. His fleet was given up to Gafca, by the man whom he
had ingled out among his officers to entrust with that important
command. On the day that was to decide his fate, an army
of veterans, in fight of the enemy, threw down their arms
without friking a blow, and deserted a leader who had often
conducted them to viEory. Instances of such general and
avowed contempt of the principles and obligations which attach
man to man, and bind them together in social union, rarely oc-
cur in history. It is only where men are far removed from the
feat of government, where the refiraints of law and order are
little felt, where the prospect of gain is unbounded, and im-
mense wealth may cover the crimes by which it is acquired,
that we can find any parallel to the levity, the rapacioufilefs,
the perfidy and corruption prevalcnt among the Spaniards in
P'eru.

ON the death of Pizarro, the malcontents in every corner of c;rcA.l dci,

Peru laid down their arms, and tranquillity ficmncd to be per- fr hl)u"L
fcdly re-eilablifhed. But two very interefling ol)jcCs flill re- d'ClS.
mained to occupy the prclident's attention. The one was to
find immediately such employment for a multitude of turbulent

and

B 0 K and daring adventurers with which the country was filled, as
A _cv- might prevent them from exciting new commotions. The

other, to bestow proper gratifications upon those to whose loy-
alty and valour he was indebted for his success. The former
of there was in some measure accomplished, by appointing Pe-
dro de Valdivia to prosecute the conquest of Chili; and by em-
powering Diego Centeno to undertake the discovery of the vast
regions bordering on the river De la Plata. The reputation of
those leaders, and the hopes of bettering their condition in a new
country, alluring many of the most indigent and desperate fol-
diers to follow their standards, drained off no inconsiderable
portion of that mutinous inflammable spirit which Gafca dreaded.

His division THE latter was an affair of greater difficulty, and to be ad-
of the coun.
try among justed with a more attentive and delicate hand. The reparti-
his followers. nzientos, or allotments of lands and Indians which fell to be

distributed, in consequence of the death or forfeiture of the for-
mer possessors, exceeded two millions of pesos of yearly rent'.
Gafca, when now absolute master of this immense property,
retained the fame difinterefled sentiments which he had origi-
nally professed, and refused to reserve the smallest portion of it
for himself. But the number of claimants was great; and
whilst the vanity or avarice of every individual fixed the value
of his own services, and eflimated the recompence which he
thought due to him, the pretensions of each were so extrava-
gant, that it was irpoflible to satisfy all. Gafca listened to
them one by one, with the most patient attention, and
that he might have leilure to weigh the comparative merit
of their several claims with accuracy, he retired, with the

portion to his idea of their pail services, and future importance.
But that he might get beyond the reach of the fierce storm of
clamour and rage, which he foresaw would burst out on the
publication of his decree, notwithstanding the impartial equity
with which he had framed it, he set out for Lima, leaving the
instrument of partition fealed up, with orders not to open it for
some days after his departure.

THE indignation excited by publishing the decree of parti- Ag. 24.

The difcon-

tion was not less than Gafca had expeced. Vanity, avarice, tentitocca-
emulation, envy, shame, rage, and all the other passions that
most vehemently agitate the minds of men when both their ho-
nour and their interest are deeply affeced, conspired in adding
to its violence. It broke out with all the fury of military info-
lence. Calumny, threats, and curses were poured out openly
upon the president. I-e was accused of ingratitude, of par-
tiality, and of injufice. Among soldiers prompt to action, such
seditious discourse would have been oon followed by deeds no

their leader, on whose arms vicory had hitherto attended, and I5
in place of anarchy and usurpation, he eftabliflled the govern-
ment of laws, and the authority of the rightful sovereign. But
the praise belfowed on his abilities was exceeded by that which
his virtue merited. After residing in a country where wealth
presented allurements which had seduced every pcrfon who had
hitherto possessed power there, he returned from that trying
flation with integrity not only untainted but unfufpeacd. After
diRributing among his countrymen poflcffions of greater extent
and value than had ever been in the dil'ofal of a fuibjed in any
age or nation, he himfclf remained in his original slate of po-
verty ; and at the very time, when he brought fich a large recruit
to the royal treasury, lie was obliged to apply by petition for a
small fum to diicharge some petty debts which he had con-
traaed during the course of his service '. Charles was not in-
sensible to such disinterested merit. Gafca was received by hinm
with the molt diflinguifhing marks of esteem, and being pro-
moted to the bishopric of Palencia, lie paffcl the remainder of
his days in the tranquillity of retirement, rcfpc-ed by his coun-
try, honoured by his fovcreign, and beloved by all.

NOTnITIISTANDING all Gafca's wife regulations, the tran-

55 excited rather by the ambition and turbulence of particular

men, than by general or public motives, the detail of them is
not the obje& of this history. These commotions in Peru, like
every thing of extreme violence either in the natural or political
body,were not of long duration, and by carrying off the corrupted
humours which had given rife to the disorders, they contributed in
the end to firengthen the society which at first they threatened to
destroy. Ding their fierce contests, several of the first invaders
of Peru, and many of those licentious adventurers whom the fame
of their success had allured thither, fell by each other's hands.
Each of the parties, as they alternately prevailed in the struggle,
cleared the country of a greater number, by executing, profcrib-
ing, or banishing their opponents. Men less enterprising and
desperate, and more accustomed to move in the path of fober
and peaceable industry, fettled in Peru; and the royal authority
was gradually eablilhed as firmly there as in the other Spa-
nifh colonies.

ority to the vi
nations of the cient contint, the inferiority of Anerica in improvement will
tincint.con be conspicuous, and neither the Mexicans nor Peruvians

will be entitled to rank with those nations which merit
the name of civilized. They, like the rude tribes around them,
were totally unacquainted with the useful metals, and the pro-
grefs which they had made in extending their dominion over
the animal creation was inconsiderable. The Mexicans had
gone no farther than to tame and rear turkeys, ducks, a
species of fmal-1 dogs, and rabbits b. By this feeble essay of in-
genuity, the means of fu.bfitemce were rendered somewhat more
plentiful and secure, than when men depend solely on hunting;
but they had no idea of attempting to subdue the more robust
animals, or of deriving any aid from their miniitry in carrying
on works of labour. The Peruvians seem to have neglected
the inferior animals, and had not rendered any of them domeflic
except the duck; but they were more fortunate in taming the
Llama, an animal peculiar to their country, in form resembling
a camel, and of a size somewhat larger than a sleep. Under the
protection of man, this species multiplied greatly. Its wool fur-
msifhed the Peruvians with clothing, its fefli with food. It was

even employed as a. beast of burden, and carried a moderate B O O K
load: witl much patience and docility '. It was never uscd for ---
draught; ad! the breed being confined to the mountainous
coutry, its service., if we may judge by incidents that occur
in the early Spanish writers, was not very cxtenfive among the
Peruvians in their original slate.

IN tracing the line by which nations proceed towards civility,

the dicovery of the useful metals, and the acquisition of domi-
nion over the animal creation, have been marked as ftcps of ca-
pital importance in their progress. In our continent, society
continued in that state which is denominated barbarous, long
after men had attained both. Even with all that command over
nature which there confer, many ages elapfc, before industry be-
comes fo.perfect as to render ifbfiftencc fecurc, before the arts that
supply the wants and furnish the accommodations of life are
invented, and before any idea is conceived of the various infli-
tutions requisite in a well-ordered society. The Mexicans and
Peruvians, without knowledge of the useful metals, or the aid
of domeflic animals, laboured under disadvantages which nmuf
have greatly retarded their progress, and in their higlhef state
of improvement, their power was so limited, and their opera-
tions so feeble, that they can hardly be confidered as having
advanced beyond the infancy of civil life.

fell below the latter.

Im),rfeta in- MEXICO was first fubjeded to the Spanish crown. But
fortiratinn concerning our acquaintance with its laws and manners is not, from
tho- of
Mexc. that circumflance, more complete. What I have remark-

ed concerning the defective and inaccurate information on
which we must rely with refped to the condition and customs
of the avage tribes in America, may be applied likewise to our
knowledge of the Mexican empire. Cortes, and the rapacious
adventurers who accompanied him, had not leisure or capacity
to enrich either civil or natural history with new observations.
They undertook their expedition in quest of one object, and
seem hardly to have turned their eyes towards any other. Or,
if during some hort interval of tranquillity, when the occupa-
tions of war ceased, and the ardour of plunder was suspended,
the institutions and manners of the people whom they had in-
vaded drew their attention, the inquiries of illiterate soldiers
were conducted with so little sagacity and precision, that the
accounts given by them of the policy and order eflablithed in
the Mexican monarchy are superficial, confused, and inexpli-
cable. It is rather from incidents which they relate occafon-
ally, than from their own dedutions and remarks, that we are
enabled to form some idea of the genius and manners of that
people. The obscurity in which the ignorance of its con-
querors involved the annals of Mexico, was augmented by the
iupcrflition of those who fuccccded them. As the memory of
pal events was prefcrved among the Mexicans by figures

5 painted
270

painted on skins, on cotton cloth, or on the bark of trees, the B 0 IC
early missionaries, unable to comprehend their meaning, and A
struck with their uncouth forms, conceived them to be monu-
ments of idolatry which ought to be destroyed, in order to fa-
cilitate the conversion of the Indians. In obedience to an edic
issued by Juan'de Zummaraga, a Franciscan monk, the first bishop
of Mexico, all those records of the ancient Mexican flory were
colleted and committed to the flames. In consequence of this
fanatical zeal of the monks who firit visited New Spain, and
which their successors oon began to lament, whatever know-
ledge of remote events such rude monuments contained was
entirely loft, and no information remained concerning the an-
cient revolutions and policy of the empire, but what was de-
rived from tradition, or from ome fragments of their historical
paintings that escaped the barbarous researches of Zummaraga d.
From the experience of all nations it is manifest, that the me-
mory of past tranfadtions can neither be long preserved, nor be
transmitted with any fidelity by tradition. The Mexican paint-
ings which are supposed to have served as annals of their em-
pire, are few in number, and of ambiguous meaning. Thus
amidll the uncertainty of the former, and the obscurity of the
latter, we mult glean what intelligence can be colleced fiom
the scanty materials scattered in the Spanifl writers.

---- weft, and fettled in different provinces of A.nabac, the ancient

name of New Spain. These, more civilized than the original
inhabitants, began to form them to the arts of social life. At
length, towards the commencement of the thirteenth century,
the Mexicans, a people more pblifhed than any of the former,
advanced from the border of the Californian gulf, and took
poffeflion of the plains adjacent to a great lake near the centre
of the country. After residing there about fifty years, they
founded a town, since distinguished by the name of Mexico,
which from humble beginnings soon grew to be the most con-
fiderable city in the New World. The Mexicans, long after
they yvere etablifhed in their new possessions, continued, like
other martial tribes in America, .unacquainted with regal do-
minion, a nd were governed in peace and conduaed in war by
such -as were entitled to pre-eminence by their wisdom or their
valour. But among them, as in other flates whose power and
territories 'becomne extensive, the supreme authority centred at
last in a ingle person; and when the Spaniards under Cortes
invaded the country, Montezuma was the ninth monarch in
order who had swayed the Mexican sceptre, not by hereditary
right, but'by election.
Very rcccnt. SUCH is the traditional tale of the Mexicans concerning the

progrcfs of their own empire. According to this, its duration
was very hort. From the first migration of their parent tribe,
they can reckon little more than three hundred years. From the
esTablishment of monarchical government, not above a hundred
and thirty years, according to one account , or a hundred
and ninety seven, according to another computation had
clapled. If, on one hand, we suppose the Mexican slate to

such a length of time as the Spanish accounts of it, civilization
would naturally lead us to conclude, it is difficult to conceive
how, among a people who poffefcdl the art of recording events
by picures, and who confidered it as an essential part ot
their national education, to teach their children to repeat the
historical songs which celebrated the exploits of their anccf-
tors , the knowledge of past tranfadions should be to slender
and limited. If, on the other hand, we adopt their own system
with refpea to the antiquities of their nation, it is no less dif-
ficult to account either for that improved slate of iociety, or for
the extensive dominion to which their empire had attained,
when firfl visited by the Spaniards. The infancy of nations is
so long, and, even when every circumflance is favourable to
their progress, they advance so slowly towards any maturity of
firength or policy, that the recent origin of the Mexicans seems
to be a firong presumption of exaggeration, in the splendid
descriptions which have been given of their-government and
manners.

of considerable progress in civilization in the Mexican empire,
and others which seem to indicate that it had advanced but
little beyond the ravage tribes around it. Both shall be exhi-
bited to the view of the reader, that, from comparing them, he

The right of
property fully we have seen, that the idea of a title to the separate, and
elablifhed. exclusive poffeflion of any object was hardly known; and

that among all, it was extremely limited and ill-defined. But
in Mexico, where agriculture and industry had made ome
progress, the diftintion between real and moveable posses-
sions, between property in land and property in goods, had
taken place. Both might be transferred from one person
to another by sale or barter; both might descend by inhe-
ritance. Every person who could be denominated a free man
had property in land. This, however, they held by various
tenures. Some possessed it in full right, and it descended to
their heirs. The title of others to their lands was derived from
the office or dignity which, they enjoyed ; and when deprived of
the latter, they loft poffefion of the former. Both these modes
of occupying land were deemed noble, and peculiar to citizens
of the highest class. The tenure, by which the great body of
the people held their property, was very different. In every
difrid a certain quantity of land was measured out, in propor-
tion to the number of families. This was cultivated by the
joint labour of the whole; its produce was deposited in a com-
mon fiorehoufe, and divided among them according to their
refpeedive exigencies. The members of the Calpullee, or affo-
ciations, could not alienate their share of the common efcate;
it was an indivisible permanent property, destined for the sup-
port of their families . In consequence of this diltribution of
the territory of the fate, every man had an interest in its wel-
fare, and the happiness of the individual was conneced with
the public security.

TfIE number and greatnes of the cities in the Mexican em- B () K

pire is one of the most firiking circumstances, that diflinguifh it , -r---'
from those nations in America which we have already described. ,.i 1n.;,
While society continues in a rude state, the wants of men are t t"l'
so few, and they stand so little in need of mutual affiiance,
that their inducements to crowd together are extremely feeble.
Their industry at the fame tine is so imperfec, that it can-
not secure subsistence for any considerable number of fami-
lies fettled in one spot. They live dispersed, at this period,
from choice as well as from necessity, or at the utmofl aemble
in small hamlets on the banks of the river which supplies them
with food, or on the border of tome plain left open by nature,
or cleared by their own labour. The Spaniards, accustomed
to this mode of habitation among all the savage tribes with
which they were then acquainted, were aftoniihed, on entering
New Spain, to find the natives residing in towns of such extent
as resembled those of Europe. In the first fervour of their ad-
miration, they compared Zempoalla, though a town only of
the second or third size, to the cities of greatefl note in their
own country. When, afterwards, they visited in fucceflion
Tlafcala, Cholula, Tacuba, Tezeuco, and Mexico itfilf, their
amazement increased so much, that it led them to convey ideas
of their magnitude and populoufilefs bordering on what is in-
credible. Even where there is leifitre for observation, and no
interest that leads to leceive, conjedlural efimates of the num-
I)er of people in cities are extremely loose, and usually much
exaggerated. It is not furprlfing, then, that Cortes and is
companions, little accustomcd to fulch computations, and power-
fully tempted to magnify, in order to exalt the merit of their
own discoveries and conquefs, fliouldl have been betrayed into
this common error, and have raiscd their dclcriptions confi-

dard of their population much lower than they have done; but
fill they will appear to be cities of such consequence, as are not
to be found but among people who have made some considerable
progress in the arts of social life g.

The frpar.- THE eparation of professions among the Mexicans is a
tion of pro-
fellions. symptom of improvement no less remarkable. Arts, in the

early ages of society, are so few and so simple, that each man
is sufficiently master of them all, to gratify every demand of
his own limited desires. The savage can form his bow, point
his arrows, rear his hut, and hollow his canoe, without call-
ing in the aid of any hand more skilful than his own. Time
must have augmented the wants of men, and ripened their in-
genuity, before the productions of art become so complicated
in their ftrucutre, or o curious in their fabric, that a particular
course of education is requisite towards forming the artificer to
expertness in contrivance and workmanship. In proportion as
refinement spreads, the diflintion of professions increases, and
they branch out into more numerous and minute subdivisions.
Among the Mexicans, this separation of the arts necessary in
life had taken place to a considerable extent. The functions
of the mafbn, the weaver, the goldfinith, the painter, and of
fcveral other crafts, were carried on by different persons. Each
was regularly iiflracd in his calling. To it alone his indufiry
was confined ; and by assiduous application to one objed, to-
gether with the pcrlfcvcring patience peculiar to Americans,
their artizans attained to a degree of neatnacs and pecrfetion in

work far beyond what could have been expected from the rude B o 0 K;

VIL

tools which they employed. Their various productions were -,-
brought into commerce; and by the exchange of them in the
ilated markets held in the cities, their mutual wants were sup-
plied h, in such orderly intcrcourfe as characSterizes an improved
slate of society.

TIlE distinction of ranks elablifhed in the Mexican empire The difin.--

is the next circumstance that merits attention. In surveying ti"on u ra" .
the savage tribes of America, we observed, that confcioufiefs
of equality, and impatience of subordination, are sentiments
natural to man in the infancy of civil life. During peace, the
authority of a superior is hardly felt among them, and even in
war it is but little acknowledged. Strangers to the idea of
property, the difference in condition resulting fiom it is un-
known. Birth or titles confer no pre-eminence; it is only by
personal merit and accomplishments that it can be acquired.
The form of society was very different among the Mexicans.
The great body of the people were in a most humiliating state.
A considerable number, known by the name of Mayeques,
nearly resembled in condition those peasants who, under va-
rious denominations, were confidered, during the prevalence
of the feudal fyfiem, as infiruments of labour attached to the foil.
The Mayeques could not change their place of residence without
permiflion of the superior on whom they depended. They were
conveyed, together with the lands on which they were fettled,
from one proprietor to another; and were bound to cultivate
the ground, and to perform several kinds of servile work '.

B 0 0 K Others were reduced to the lowefi form of fubjeaion, that of
-- -- domestic servitude, and felt the utmost rigour of that wretched

slate. Their condition was held to be so vile, and their lives
deemed to be of so little value, that a person who killed one of
those slaves was not fubjeted to any punishment k. Even tho'e
con fidered as freemen were treated by their haughty lords as beings
of an inferior species. The nobles, possessed of ample territories,
were divided into various classes, to each of which peculiar titles
of honour belonged. Some of there titles, like their lands, de-
scended from father to son in perpetual succession. Others were
annexed to particular offices, or conferred during life as marks
of personal diflindion '. The monarch, exalted above all, en-
joyed extensive power, and supreme dignity. Thus the dil-
tindion of ranks was completely eftablilled, in a line of re-
gular ubordination, reaching from the highest to the lowes
member of the community. Each of these knew what he could
claim, and what he owed. The people, who were not allowed
to wear a dress of the fame faflion, or to dwell in houses of a
form similar to those of the nobles, accofred them with the molt
submissive reverence. In the presence of their overeign, they
durst not lift their eyes from the ground, or look him in the
face m. The nobles themselves, when admitted to an audience
of their sovereign, entered bare-footed, in mean garments,
and, as his slaves, paid him homage approaching to adoration.
This rcfpel due from inferiors to those above them in rank,
was eftabliflhed with such ceremonious accuracy, that it incor-
porated with their language, and influenced its genius and
idiom. The Mexican tongue abounded in expressions of re-
verence and courtesy. The flile and appellations, used in the

in ocieties, which time and the intfitution of regular govern-
ment have moulded into form, that we find such an orderly
arrangement of men into different ranks, and such nice atten-
tion paid to their various rights.

THE spirit of the Mexicans, thus familiarized and bended Their politi-

government. But the descriptions of their policy and laws, by
the Spaniards who overturned them, are so inaccurate and
contradicory, that it is difficult to delineate the form of their
conflitution with any precision. Sometimes they represent
the monarchs of Mexico as absolute, deciding according to
their pleasure, with refpea to every operation of the state.
On other occasions, we discover the traces of established cuf-
toms and laws, framed in order to circumscribe the power
of the crown, and we meet with rights and privileges of the
nobles which seem to be opposed as barriers against its en-
croachments. This appearance of inconsistency has arisen
from inattention to the innovations of Montezuma upon the
Mexican policy. His aspiring ambition subverted the ancient
fyflem of government, and introduced a pure defpotifin. He
disregarded their laws, violated their privileges, and reduced
his ifubjeLs of every order to the level of slaves . The
chiefs, or nobles of the firit rank, submitted to the yoke with
such reludance, that, from impatience to hake it off, and hope
of recovering tleiroriginal rights, many of them courted the

zuma, but under those of his predecessors, that we can disco-
ver wilat was the original form and genius of Mexican policy.
From the foundation of the monarchy to the eletion of Mon-
tezuma, it fecms to have fibfifted with little variation. That
body of citizens, which may be diflinguifhed by the name of
nobility, formed the chief and most refpetable order in the
slate. They were of various ranks, as has already been ob-
fcrved, and their honours were acquired and transmitted in dif-
ferent manners. Their number seems to have been great. Ac-
cording to an author accuflomed to examine with attention
what he relates, there were in the Mexican empire thirty of
this or"der, each of whom had in his territories about a hun-
dred thousand people, and ubordinate to there, there were
about three thousand nobles of a lower class . The territories
belonging to the chiefs of Tezeuco and Tacuba, were hardly
inferior in extent to those of the Mexican monarch r. Each of
there pofeffed complete territorial jurifdiaion, and levied taxes
from their own vassals. But all followed the ltandard of
Mexico in war, serving with a number of men in proportion
to their domain, and most of them paid tribute to its monarch
as their superior lord.

IN tracing those great lines of the Mexican constitution, an

image of feudal policy in its most rigid form rites to view,

with the executive power of the slate. Its spirit and principles _.
seem to have operated in the New World in the fame manner,
as in the ancient. The jurifdition of the crown was extremely
limited. All real and efFccive authority was retained by the
Mexican nobles in their owil hands, and the shadow of it
only left to the king. Jealous to excess of their own rights,
they guarded with most vigilant anxiety against the encroach-
ments of their sovereigns. By a fundamental law of the em-
pire, it was provided that the king lhould not determine con-
cerning any point of general importancc, without the appro-
bation of a council composcd of the prime nobility . Unless
he obtained their content he could not engage the nation in
war, nor could he dispose of the mofl considerable branch of the
public revenue at pleasure, it was appropriated to certain pur-
poses from which it could not be diverted by the regal autho-
rity . In order to secure full effeet to those constitutional re-
firaints, the Mexican nobles did not permit their crown to
descend by inheritance, but disposed of it by elecion. The
right of election seems to have been originally veiled in the
whole body of nobility, but was afterwards committed to fix
elecdors, of whom the Chiefs of Tezeuco and Tacuba were
always two. From refpec for the family of their monarchs,
the choice fell generally upon some person sprung from it.
But as the aivity and valour of their prince was of greater
moment to a people perpetually engaged in war, than a firiCt
adherence to the order of birth, collaterals of mature age or
diflinguiflied merit were often preferred to those who were

had attained when Cortes landed in New Spain.

splendour of their government augmented. It was in this last
slate that the Spaniards beheld it, and firuck with the appear-
ance of Montezuma's court, they describe its pomp at great
length, and with much admiration. The number of his at-
tendants, the order, the silence, and the reverence with which
they served him; the vast extent of his royal mansion, the
variety of its apartments allotted to different officers, and the
oflentation with which his grandeur was displayed, whenever
he permitted his fubjeds to behold him, seem to resemble the
magnificence of the ancient monarchies in Asia, rather than the
simplicity of the infant fiates in the New World.

own immediate vassals, was veiled in the crown. Judges were
appointed for each department, and if we may rely on the ac-

mnent was not less sagacious. Taxes were laid upon land, upon hfit.ppr
the acquisitions of industry, and upon commodities of every
kind exposed to sale in the public markets. These duties,
though considerable, were not arbitrary, or unequal. They
were imposed according to efablifhed rules, and each knew what
share of the common burden he had to bear. As the use of
money was unknown, all the taxes were paid in kind, and thus
not only the natural producions of all the different provinces
in the empire, but every species of manufacture, and every
work of ingenuity and art were collected in the public fore-
houses. From those the emperor supplied his numerous train
of attendants in peace, and his armies during war, with food,
with cloaths, and ornaments. People of inferior condition,
neither poffefling land nor engaged in commerce, were bound
to the performance of various services. By their ifated la-
bour the crown-lands were cultivated, public works were
carried on, and the various houses belonging to the emperor
were built, and kept in repair ".

intelligence from one part of the empire to the other, was a
refinement in police not introduced into any kingdom of Eu-

lake, with artificial dykes, and causeways of great length, which
served as avenues to it from different quarters, erected in the water
with no less ingenuity than labour, seems to be an idea that
could not have occurred to any but a civilized people. The
fame observation may be applied to the structure of the aque-
ducts, or conduits, by which they conveyed a stream of freh

of the-taufeways . The appointment of a considerable num-

as the most decisive proof of their superior refinement. Cortes,
and the early Spanish authors, describe this with rapture, and
maintain, that the most celebrated European artists could not
surpass or even equal them in ingenuity and neatness of work-
manship. They represented men, animals, and other objets,
by such a disposition of various coloured feathers, as is said to
have produced all the effecs of light and fliade, and to have
imitated nature with truth and delicacy. Their ornaments of
gold and silver have been described to be of a fabric no less
curious. But in forming any idea, from general defcrip-

tions, concerning the slate of arts among nations imperfec2ly B 0 o K
poliffed, we are extremely ready to err. In examining the --
works of people whose advances in 'improvement are nearly the
fame with our own, we view them with a critical, and often
with a jealous eye. Whereas, when conscious of our own fu-
periority, we survey the arts of nations comparatively rude,
we are astonished at works executed by them under such ma-
nifeft diladvantages, and in the warmth of our admiration,
are apt to represent them as productions more finified than
they really are. To the influence of this illusion, without
supposing any intention to deceive, we may impute the exagge-
ration of some Spanish authors, in their accounts of the Mex-
ican arts.

IT is not from those descriptions, but from confidering such

specimens of their arts as are still preserved, that we must de-
cide concerning their degree of merit. As the ship in which
Cortes sent to Charles V. the most curious producions of the
Mexican artisans, which were collected by the Spaniards when
they first pillaged the empire, was taken by a French corsair ,
the remains of their ingenuity are less numerous than those of
the Peruvians. Whether any of their works with feathers, in
imitation of painting, be fill extant in Spain, I have not
learned; but many of their ornaments in gold and silver, as
well as various utensils employed in common life, are deposited
in the magnificent cabinet of natural and artificial produscions,
lately opened by the king of Spain; and I am informed by
persons on whose judgment and taste I can rely, that there boast-
ed efforts of their art are uncouth representations of common
objecs, or very coarse images of the human and tome animal

forms,

28S

B K forms, destitute of grace and propriety . The justness of there
- v--- observations is confirmed by infpeding the wooden prints or

copper-plates of their paintings, which have been published by
various authors. In them every figure of men, of quadrupeds,
or birds, as well as every representation of inanimated nature,
is extremely rude and aukward. The hardef Egyptian file,
fliff and imperfect as it was, is more elegant. The scrawls of
children delineate objeCs almost as accurately.

BUT however low the Mexican paintings may be ranked,

when viewed merely as works of art, a very different flation
belongs to them, when confidered as the records of their coun-
try, as, historical monuments of its policy and tranfations;
and they become curious as well as interefling objects of atten-
tion. The nobleR and m oft beneficial invention of which hu-
man ingenuity can boast, is that of writing. But the sirs essays
of this art, which hath contributed more than all others to the
improvement of the species, were very rude, and it advanced
towards perfection slowly, and by a gradual progression. When
the warrior, cager for fame, wished to transmit ome knowledge
of his exploits to succeeding ages; when the gratitude of a peo-
ple to their sovereign prompted them to hand down an account of
his beneficent deeds to posterity; the first method ofaccomplifhing
this, that seems to have occurred to them, was to delineate, in
the best manner they could, figures representing the acion of
which they were Solicitous to preserve the memory. Of this,
which has very properly been called piflure-wvriting h, we find
traces among some of the most savage tribes of America. When
a leader returns from the field, he strips a tree of its bark, and

with red paint scratches upon it some uncouth figures, which B o 0 K
represent the order of his march, the number of his followers, ---
the enemy whom he attacked, the scalps and captives which
he brought home. To those simple annals he trusts for renown,
and sooth.s himself with hope that by their means he shall
receive praise from the warriors of future times '.

COMIPARED with those aukward essays of their avage coun-

trymen, the paintings of the Mexicans may be confidered as
works of composition and design. They were not acquainted,
it is true, with any other method of recording tranfadcions,
than that of delineating the objects which they wished to re-
present. But they could exhibit a more complex series of events
in progreflive order, and dcfcribe, by a proper disposition of
figures, the occurrences of a king's reign from his accession to
his death; the progress of an infant's education from its birth
until it attained to the years of maturity; the different recom-
pences and marks of diftintion conferred upon warriors, in
proportion to the exploits which they had performed. Some
singular specimens of this picure-writing have been preserved,
which are jufily confidered as the most curious moLnumrents of
art brought from the New World. The most valuable of these
was published by Prchas in fixty-fix plates. It is divided
into three parts. The first contains the hiflory of the Mexican
empire under its ten monarchs. The second is a tribute-roll,
reprelcnting what each conquered town paid into the royal
trcafury. The third is a code of their inflitutions, domeflic,
political, and military. Another specimen of Mexican paint-
ing has been publishcd in thirty-two plates, by the prefcnt

B 0 Ko archbifllop of Toledo. To both are annexed a full explana-
---_ tion of what the figures were intended to represent, which

was obtained by the Spaniards from Indians well acquainted
with their own arts. The ityle of painting in all there is the
fame. They represent tings, not words. They exhibit images
to the eye, not ideas to the understanding. They may, there-
fore, be confidered as the earliest and most imperfect essay of
men in their progress towards discovering the art of writing.
The dcfers in this mode of recording tranfadions muff have
been early felt. To paint every occurrence was, from its na-
ture, a very tedious operation; and as affairs became more
complicated, and events multiplied in any society, its annals
muffhave swelled to an enormous bulk. Beides this, no ob-
jeas could be delineated but those of sense; the conceptions of
the mind had no corporeal form, and as long as piaure-writ-
ing could not convey an idea of these, it muff have been a
very imperfec art. The necessity of improving it mufft have
rouzed and fliarpened invention, and the human mind holding
the fame course in the New World as in the Old, might have
advanced by the fame successive steps, first, from an atual
picture to the plain hieroglyphic; next, to the allegorical sym-
bol, then to the arbitrary character; until, at length, an al-
phabet of letters was discovered, capable of expressing all the
variety of combinations of found employed in speech. In the
paintings of the Mexicans we, accordingly, perceive, that this
progress was begun among them. Upon an attentive infpec-
tion of the plates, which I have mentioned, we may observe
some approach to the plain or finple hieroglyphic, where some
principal part or circumstance in the subjea is made to stand
for the whole. In the annals of their kings, publilhed by
Purchas, the towns conquered by each are uniformly repre-

5 fcnted
288

sented in the fame manner by a rude delineation of a house; B K
but in order to point out the particular towns which submitted v---
to their victorious arms, peculiar emblems, ometimes natural
objeas, and ometimes artificial figures, are employed. In the
tribute-roll, published by the archbishop of Toledo, the house,
which was properly the picture of the town, is omitted, and
the emblem alone is employed to represent it. They seem even
to have made some advances beyond this, towards the use of
the more figurative and fanciful hieroglyphic. In order to
describe a monarch, who had enlarged his dominions by force
of arms, they painted a target ornamented with darts, and
placed it between him and those towns which he subdued. But
it is only in one instance, the notation of numbers, that
we discern any attempt to exhibit ideas which had no
corporeal form. They had invented artificial marks, or igns
ofconvention, for this purpose. By means of there, they com-
puted the years of their kings reigns, as well as the amount
of tribute to be paid into the royal treasury. The figure of a
circle represented unit, and in small numbers, the computa-
tion was made by repeating it. Larger numbers were ex-
pressed by a peculiar mark, and they had such as denoted all
integral numbers from twenty to eight thousand. The short
duration of their empire prevented the Mexicans from advan-
cing farther in that long course which conducts men from the
labour of delineating real objets, to the simplicity and ease of
alphabetic writing. Their records, notwithstanding some dawn
of iuch ideas as might have led to a more perfec ftylc, can be
confidered as nothing more than a species of piCure-writing, b
far improved as to mark their fiperiority over the savage
tribes of America, but still so defctive as to prove that they had

vided their year into eighteen months, each consisting of twenty
days, amounting in all to three hundred and sixty. But as they
observed that the course of the fun was not completed in that
time, they added five days to the year. These, which were
properly intercalary days, they termedfupernumnerary or 'waJe;
and as they did not belong to any month, no work was done,
and.,no sacred rite performed on them; they were devoted
wholly to festivity and pastime . This near approach to phi-
lofophical accuracy is a remarkable proof that the Mexicans
had bestowed rome attention upon inquiries and speculations,
to which men in a very rude state never turn their thoughts.

not differ greatly from thoe of the other inhabitants of Ame-
rica.

Their wars LIKE the rude tribes around them, the Mexicans were in-
continual and
ferocious. ceffantly engaged in war, and the motives which prompted them

to hostility seem to have been the fame. They fought, in order
to gratify their vengeance, by shedding the blood of their cnc-

mies. In battle they were chiefly intent on taking prisoners, B 0 0 K
and it was by the number of these that they eflimated the glory i
of viaory. No captive was ever ransomed or sparcd. All were
sacrificed without mercy, and their flesh devoured with the fame
barbarous joy as among the fiercest savages. On some occasions
it rose to even wilder excefles. Their principal warriors covered
themselves with the kins of the unhappy vicims which they
had slain, and danced about the freets, boasting of their own
valour, and exulting over their enemies . Even in their civil
institutions we discover traces of that barbarous disposition
which their system of war inspired. The four chief counsellors
of the empire were distinguished by atrocious titles, which
could have been afiumed only by a people who delighted in
blood 3. This ferocity of character prevailed among all the na-
tions of New Spain. The Tlafcalans, the people of Mechoacan,
and other states at enmity with the Mexicans, delighted equally
in war, and treated their prisoners with the fame cruelty. In
proportion as mankind combine in social union, and live under
the influence of equal laws and regular policy, their manners
soften, sentiments of humanity arise, and the rights of the fpe-
cies come to be underflood. The fierceness of war abates, and
even while engaged in hostility, men remember what they owe
one to another. The savage fights to deflroy, the citizen to
conquer. The former neither pities nor spares, the latter has
acquired sensibility that tempers his rage. To this sensibility
the Mexicans seem to have been perfec firangers, and among
them war was carried on with so much of its original barbarity,
that we cannot but fufped their degree of civilization to have
been very imperfct.

gour. Both, according to their observation, were of such a
feeble frame as to be unable to endure fatigue, and the strength
of one Spaniard exceeded that of several Indians. This they
imputed to their scanty diet, on poor fare, sufficient to preserve
life, but not to give firmness to the constitution '. Such a remark
could hardly have been made with refped to any people fur-
nifhed plentifully with the neceftaries of life. The difficulty
which Cortes found in procuring subsistence for his small body
of soldiers, who were often constrained to live on the fponta-
neous productions of the earth, seems to confirm the remark
of the Spanish writers, and gives no high idea of the slate of

those fads in the hiflory of the New World which fcems to
have been admitted without due examination or sufficient evi-
dence. The Spaniih hiflorians, in order to magnify the valour
of their countrymen, are accustomed to represent the dominion
of Montezuma as fretching over all the provinces of New
Spain from the North to the Southern Ocean. But a great part
of the mountainous country was possessed by the Otomies, a
fierce uncivilized people, who seem to have been the residue of
the original inhabitants. The provinces towards the north
and weft of Mexico were occupied by the Chichejmecas, and
other tribes of hunters. None of these recognized the Mexi-
can monarch as their superior. Even in the interior and more
level country, there were several cities and provinces which had
never submitted to the Mexican yoke. Tlafcala, though only
twenty-one leagues from the capital of the empire, was an in-
dependent and hofile republic. Cholula, though fill nearer,
had been fulbjccd only a short time before the arrival of the

BOO K Spaniards. Tepeaca, at the diflance of thirty leagues from

_.-.. Mexico, seems to have been a separate slate, governed by its

own laws '. Mechoacan, the frontier of which extended within
forty leagues of Mexico, was a powerful kingdom, remarkable
for its implacable enmity to the Mexican name". By there
hoffile powers the Mexican empire was circumscribed on every
quarter, and the high ideas which we are apt to form of it from
the description of the Spanish historians, should be considerably
moderated.

Little inter- IN consequence of this independence of several fates in New
course among
its several Spain upon the Mexican empire, there was not any considerable
provinces. intercourse between its various provinces. Even in the interior

country, not far distant from the capital, there seem to have
been no roads to facilitate the communication of one diftrit
with another; and when the Spaniards firif attempted to pe-
netrate into it, they had to open their way through forests
and marlhes . Cortes, in his adventrous march fiom Mexico
to Honduras in 1525, met with obftrudions and endured hard-
hips little inferior to those with which he mufi have firuggled
in the most uncivilized regions of America. In rome places, he
could hardly force a passage through impervious woods, and
plains overflowed with water. In others, he found so little cul-
tivation, that his troops were frequently in danger of perifling
by famine. Such fads correspond ill with the pompous de-
scription which the Spaniih writers give of Mexican police and
indufiry, and convey an idea of a country nearly similar to that
possessed by the Indian tribes in North America. Here and

there a trading or a war-path, as they are called in North Ame-
rica, led from one settlement to another0, but generally there
appeared no sign of any eftablifled communication, few marks
of industry, and no monument of art.

A NO less striking proof of this imperfecion in their com-

mercial intercourse is their want of money, or ome universal
standard by which to estimate the value of commodities. Tlie
discovery of this is among the fleps of greatest consequence in
the progress of nations. Until it has been made, all their
tranfations must be so aukward, so operose, and so limited, that
we may boldly pronounce that they have advanced but a little
way in their career. The invention of such a commercial
standard is of such high antiquity in our hemisphere, and rifes
so far beyond the ara of authentic history, as to appear almost
coeval with the existence of society. The precious metals seem
to have been early employed for this purpose, and from their
permanent value, their divisibility, and many other qualities,
they are better adapted to serve as a common standard, than any
other fubfiance of which Nature has given us the command.
But in the New World, where there metals abound most, this-
use of them was not known. The exigencies of rude tribes, or
of monarchies imperfectly civilized, did not call for it. All
their commercial intercourse was carried on by barter, and their
ignorance of any common standard by which to facilitate that
exchange of commodities which contributes to much towards
the comfort of life, may be justly mentioned as an evidence
of the infant slate of their policy. But even in the New
World the inconvenience of wanting ome general instrument of
commerce began to be felt, and some efforts were made towards.

VB K supplying that defea. The Mexicans, among whom the number
i -v-.j and greatness of their cities gave rife to a more extended com-

merce, than in any part of America, had begun to employ a
common tfandard of value, which rendered smaller tranfaions
much more easy. As chocolate was the favourite drink of
persons in every rank of life, the nuts or almonds of cacao, of
which it is comnpofed, were of such universal consumption, that,
in their stated markets, there were willingly received in return
for commodities of small price. Thus they came to be con-
fidered as the instrument of commerce, and the value of what
one wiihed to dispose of, was eflimated by the number of nuts
of the cacao, which he might expec in exchange for it. This
seems to be the utmost length which the Americans had ad-
vanced towards the discovery of any expedient for supplying
the use of money. And if the want of it is to be held, on one
hand, as a proof of their barbarity, this expedient for supplying
that want, should be admitted on the other, as an evidence no
less satisfying, of the superior progress which the Mexicans had
made in refinement and civilization.

Doubts con- IN such a rude slate were many of the Mexican pro-
cerninther vinces when sirs visited by their conquerors. Even their
slate of their
cities. cities, extensive and populous as they were, seem rather to be

the habitation of men just emerging from barbarity, than the
residence of a polished people. The description of Tlafcala

caprice of each proprietor, built with turf and lfone, and

fition of the houses was more orderly, the flrudure of the greater ---
part was equally mean. Nor does the fabric of their temples and 'rl,!e,,
other public edifices iecm to have been such as entitled them to
the high praises bellowed upon them by many Spanifl authors.
As far as one can gather from their obscure and inaccurate de-
scriptions, the great temple of Mexico, the most famous in New
Spain, which has been represented as a magnificent building,
railed to such a height, that the ascent to it was by a flair-cafe
of a hundred and fourteen steps, was a solid mass of earth of a
square form faced partly with tfone. Its bae on each fide
extended ninety feet, and decreasing gradually as it advanced
in height, it terminated in a quadrangle of about thirty feet,
where were placed a shrine of the deity and two altars on
which the vidims were sacrificed . All the other celebrated
temples of New Spain exactly resembled that of Mexico '. Such
ftrudures convey no high idea of progress in art and ingenuity;
and one can hardly conceive that a form more rude and simple
could have occurred to a nation, in its first efforts towards cre&-
ing any great work.

o K easily account for the total deflruaion of whatever had any ap.
----,; pearance of splendor in that capital. But as only two centuries

and a half have elapsed since the conquest of New Spain, it
seems altogether incredible that in a period so short, every vef-
tige of this boasted elegance and grandeur hould have difap-
peared; and that in none of the other cities, particularly in
those which did not susser by the deftruaive hand of the con.
querors, there are not any ruins, which can be confidered as
monuments of their ancient magnificence.

EVEN in a village of the rudest Indians there are buildings

of greater extent and elevation than common dwelling-houfes.
Those which are destined for holding the council of the tribe,
and in which all assemble on occasions of public festivity, may
be called flately edifices, when compared with the reft. As
among the Mexicans the diftinaion of ranks was etablifhed,
and property was unequally divided, the number of distinguished
firuatures in their towns would of course be greater than in
other parts of America. But these seem not to have been either
so solid or magnificent as to merit there pompous epithets which
some Spanish authors employ in describing them. It is pro-
bable that, though. more ornamented, and built on a larger
scale, they were erected with the fame flight materials which
the Indians employed in their common buildings ', and Time,
in a space much less than. two hundred and fifty years,. may
have swept away all remains of them '.

FROM this enumeration of fads, it seems, upon the whole, to be
evident that the state of society in Mexico was considerably ad-

But it is no less manifest, that with refpea to many particulars, the v
Spanish accounts of their progress appear to be highly embellished.
There is not a more frequent or a more fertile source of decep-
tion in describing the manners and arts of savage nations, or
of such as are imperfectly civilized, than that of applying to
them the names and phrases appropriated to the inflitutions and
refinements of polished life. When the leader of a finall tribe,
or the head of a rude community, is dignified with the title of
king or emperor, the place of his refidencc can receive no other
name but that of his palace; and whatever his attendants may
be, they mufl be called his court. Under such appellations they
acquire an importance and dignity which does not belong to
them. The illusion spreads, and giving a false colour to every
part of the narrative, the imagination is so much carried away
with the resemblance, that it becomes difficult to discern objects
as they really are. The Spaniards, when they first touched
on the Mexican coast, were so much struck with the appearance
of attainments in policy and in the arts of life, far superior to
those of the rude tribes with which they were hitherto acquainted,
that they fancied they had at length discovered a civilized people
in the New World. This comparison between the people of
Mexico and their uncultivated neighbours thay seem to have kept
constantly in view, and observing with admiration many things
which marked their pre-eminence, they employ in describing
their imperfect policy and infant arts, fich terms as are appli-
cable to the infiitutions of men far beyond them in improve-
ment. Both there circumflances concur in detraacing from the
credit due to the early Spanifl descriptions of Mexican manners.
By drawing a parallel between them and thofc of people to much,
lcla civilized, they raiscd their own ideas too high. By their

- exalted above truth. Later writers have adopted the style of the

original hiflorians, and improved upon it. The colours with
.which D Solis delineates the character of Montezuma, the
splendor of his court, the laws and policy of his empire, are
the fame that he mufl have employed in exhibiting to view the
monarch and inflitutions of an highly polished people.

BUT though we may admit, that the warm imagination of

the Spanifl writers has added fore embelliffiment to their dc-
scriptions, this will not justify the decilive and peremptory
tone, with which several authors pronounce all their accounts of
theMexican power, policy and laws, to be the fidions of men
who wished to deceive, or who delighted in the marvellous.
There are few historical fads that can be ascertained by evi-
dence more unexceptionable, than may be produced in support
of the material articles, in the description of the Mexican con-
ftitution and manners. Eye-witnesses relate what they had be-
held, men who had resided among the Mexicans both before
and after the conquest, describe institutions and customs which
were familiar to them, persons of such different professions that
objeds must have presented themselves to their view under every.
various asped, soldiers, priefis, and lawyers, all concur in their
teflimony. Had Cortcs ventured to impose upon his sovereign,
by exhibiting to him a pidure of imaginary manners, there
wanted not enemies and rivals who were qualified to dcte his
deceit, and who would have rejoiced in exposing it. But
according to the jufi remark of an author, whose inge-
nuity has illustrated and whose eloquence has adorned the hil-
tory of America ', this supposition is in itself as improbable, as

tahe attempt would have been audacious. Who among the de- B 0 0 K
ftroyers of this great empire was so enlightened by science, or _
so attentive to the progress and operations of men in social life,
as to frame a fictitious fyltem of policy, so well combined and
so consistent, as that which they delineate,. in their accounts of
the Mexican government ? VWhere could they have borrowed
the idea of many inflitutions in lcgiflation and police, to which,
at that period, there was nothing parallel in the nations with
which they were acquainted ? There was not at the beginning
of the sixteenth century, a regular cftabliflment of poRs for
conveying intelligence, to the sovereign of any kingdom in
Europe. The fame observation will apply to what they relate,
with refpea to the ftrucure of the city of Mexico, the regulations
concerning its police, and various laws eftabliflcd for the admi-
nifiration of justice, or securing the happiness of the community.
Whoever is accustomed to contemplate the progress of nations,
will often, at very early flages of it, discover a premature and
unexpected dawn of those ideas, which give rife to inflitutions,
that are the pride and ornament of its most advanced period.
Even in a slate as imperfectly polished as the Mexican empire,
the happy genius of some sagacious obfervcr, excited or aided
by circumfiances unknown to us, may have introduced inflitu-
tions which are seldom found but in focictics highly refined.
But it is almost impossible that the illiterate conquerors of the
New World should have formed in any one inflance a conception
of cufloms and laws, beyond the flandard of improvement in their
own age and country. Or if Cortes and his followers had been ca-
pable of this, what inducement had those by whom they were fu-
perfeded to continue the deception ? Why flould Corita, or Moto-

linca,

B O o K linea, or Acofta, have amused their sovereign or their fellow-

VII.
t- citizens with a tale purely fabulous ?

Religion of IN one particular, however, the guides whom we must fol.
the Mexicans. low have represented the Mexicans to be more barbarous per-

haps than they really were. Their religious tenets, and the
rites of their worship, are described by them as wild and cruel
in an extreme degree. Religion, which occupies no confider-
able place in the thoughts of.a savage, whose conceptions of any
superior power are obscure, and his sacred rites few and simple,
was formed, among the Mexicans, into a regular system, with
its complete train of priests, temples, vicims, and festivals.
This, of itself, is a clear proof that the slate of the Mex-
icans was very different from that of the ruder American tribes.
But from the extravagance of their religious notions, or the
barbarity of their rites, no conclusion can be drawn with cer-
.tainty concerning the degree of their civilization. For nations,
long after their ideas begin to enlarge, and their manners to
refine, adhere to fyflems of superstition founded on the rude
conceptions of early ages. From the genius of the Mexican
religion we may, however, form a most just conclusion with
refped to its influence upon the charater of the people. The
asped of superstition in Mexico was gloomy and atrocious. Its
divinities were clothed with terror, and delighted in vengeance.
They were exhibited to the people under detestable forms that
created horror. The figures of serpents, of tygers, and of other
defirudive animals, decorated their temples. Fear was the only
principle that inspired their votaries. Fasts, mortifications, and
penances, all rigid andmany of them excruciating to an extreme

degrec,
3o0

degree, were the means which they employed to appease their B O0 K
wrath, and they never approached their altars without fprin- -,
kling them with blood drawn from their own bodies. But, of all
offerings, human sacrifices were deemed the most acceptable.
This religious belief, mingling with the implacable spirit of
vengeance, and adding new force to it, every captive taken in
war was brought to the temple, was devoted as a victim to the
deity, and sacrificed with rites no less solemn than cruel . The
heart and head were the portion consecrated to the gods; the
warrior by whose prowess the prisoner had been seized, carried
off the body to feast upon it with his friends. Under the im-
prefflon of ideas so dreary and terrible, and accuflomed daily to
scenes of bloodshed rendered awful by religion, the heart of
man must harden, and be fleeled to every sentiment of hu-
manity. The spirit of the Mexicans was accordingly un-
feeling and atrocious. The genius of their religion so far
counterbalanced the influence of policy and arts, that, not-
withstanding their progress in both, their manners, instead of
softening, became more fierce. To what circumstances it was
owing that superstition assumed such a dreadful form among
the Mexicans, we have not sufficient knowledge of their
history to determine. But its influence is visible, and produced
an effe& that is singular in the hiflory of the human species.
The manners of the people in the New World who had made
the greatest progress in the arts of policy, were the molt fero-
cious, and the barbarity of some of their cutoms exceeded even
those of the savage state.

B o o IK by the Spaniards, it had fubfifled four hundred years, under

ifory, which the Peruvians could communicate to their con-
uincrtain. qtlerors, must have been both imperfect and uncertain . Like

the other American nations, they were totally unacquainted
with the art of writing, and deltitute of the only means by
which the memory of past tranfaaions can be preserved with
any degree of accuracy. Even among people to whom the ut:
of letters is known, the ra where the authenticity of hifiory
commences, is much posterior to the introduction of writing.
That noble invention continued long subservient to the common
business and wants of life, before it was cmployed in record-
ing events, with a view of conveying information from one
age to another. But in no country did ever tradition alone
carry down hifloric knowledge, in any full continued fiream
during a period of half the length that the monarchy of Peru
is laid to have fubfiRcd.

Defeas in THE 2iipos, or 'knots on cords of different colours, which
eby ir rrds are celebrated by authors fond of the marvellous, as if they had

been regular annals of the empire, imperfectly supplied the
place of writing. According to the obscure description of them
by Acofta ", which Garcilaffo de la Vega has adopted with little
variation and no improvement, the quipos seem to have been a
device for rendering calculation more expeditious and accurate.
By the various colours different objets were denoted, and by
each knot a diftina number. Thus an account was taken, and
a kind of register kept, of the inhabitants in each province, or
of the several produions colleced there for public use. But

presented, they contributed little towards preserving the memory -
of ancient events and institutions. The Mexican paintings and
symbols, rude as they were, conveyed to them more knowledge
of remote tranfaaions, than the Peruvians could derive from
their boasted quipos. Had they been even of more extcnfive
use, and better adapted to supply the place of written records,
they perished so generally, together with the other monuments
of the Peruvian ingenuity, in the general wreck occasioned by
the Spanish conquest, and the civil wars subsequent to it, that no
accession of light or knowledge comes from them. All the zeal
of Garcilaffo de la Vega for the honour of that race of monarchs
from whom he descended, all the industry of his researches, and
the superior advantages with which he carried them on, opened
no source of information unknown to the Spanish authors who
wrote before him. In his Royal Commentaries, he confines him-
self to illustrate what they had related concerning the antiquities
and institutions of Peru ; and his illustrations, like their
accounts, are derived entirely from the traditionary tales cur-
rent among his countrymen.

VERY little credit then is due to the minute details which

have been given of the exploits, the battles, the conquests, and
private character of the early Peruvian monarchs. We can
reft upon nothing in their flory, as authentic, but a few
fads, so interwoven in the system of their religion and po-
licy, as preserved the memory of them from being loft; and

'-_-_v-' fully to these, and endeavouring to separate them from what

appears to be fabulous, or of doubtful authority, I have la-
boured to form an idea of the Peruvian government and

manners.

Origin of THE people of Peru, as I have already observed', had not
their civil
policy. advanced beyond the rudest form of savage life, when Manco

Capac, and his consort Mama Ocollo, appeared to inftrud and
civilize them. Who there extraordinary personages were, whe-
ther they imported their system of legislation and knowledge of
arts from some country more improved, or, if natives of Peru,
how they acquired ideas so far superior to those of the people
whom they addressed, are circumstances with refpea to which
the Peruvian tradition conveys no information. Manco Capac
and his consort, taking advantage of the propensity in the Pe-
ruvians to fuperfliticn, and particularly of their veneration for
the Sun, pretended to be children of that glorious luminary,
and to deliver their inftruaions in his name and authority.
The multitude liflened and believed. What reformation in
policy and manners the Peruvians ascribe to those founders of
their empire, and how, from the precepts of the Inca and his
consort, their ancestors gradually acquired ome knowledge of
those arts, and some relish for that industry, which render sub-
fiftence secure and life comfortable, hath been formerly related.
Thoe blessings were originally confined within narrow pre-
cinds; for the authority of the first Inca did not reach many
leagues beyond Cuzco. But, in process of time, his fucceflbrs
extended their dominion over all the regions that firetch to the

laws. Religious ideas make such a feeble iinpreffion on the
mind of a avage, that their effeCt upon his sentiments and
manners are hardly perceptible. Among the Mexicans, reli-
gion, reduced into a regular system, and holding a considerable
place in their public inflitutions, operated with conspicuous
efficacy in forming the peculiar character of that people. But
in Peru, the whole system of civil policy was founded on reli-
gion. The Inca appeared not only as a legislator, but as the
messenger of Heaven. His precepts were received not merely
as the injuntions of a superior, but as the mandates of the
Deity. His race was held to be sacred; and in order to pre-
serve it diftin&l, without being polluted by any mixture of infe-
rior blood, the sons of Manco Capac married their own sifters,
and no person was ever admitted to the throne who could not
claim it by such a pure descent. To those Chillren of the Sun,
for that was the appellation bestowed upon all the offspring of
the first Inca, the people looked up with the reverence due to
beings of a superior order. They were deemed to be under the
immediate protetion of the deity from whom they issued, and
by him every order of the reigning Inca was supposed to be
didated.

FROM those ideas two consequences rcCulted. The authority Two remnr;-

of the Inca was unlimited and absolute, in the moll extensive ablel eflfts of
meaning of the words. Whencvcr the decrees of a prince are

with implicit refpetl. This must necessarily be the effe of
every government eflablifhed on pretensions of intercourse with
fiperior powers. Such accordingly was the blind fubmiflion
which the Peruvians yielded to their sovereigns. The persons of
highest rank and greatest power in their dominions acknow-
ledged them to be of a more exalted nature; and in testimony
of this, when admitted into their presence, they entered with
a burden upon their shoulders, as an emblem of their servitude,
and willingness to bear whatever the Inca was pleated to impore.
Among their fubjeats, force was not requisite to second their
commands. Every officer entrutfed with the execution of them
was revered, and, according to the account of an intelligent
observer of Peruvian manners , might proceed alone from one
extremity of the empire to another, without meeting oppofi-
tion; for, on producing a fringe from the royal Borla, an orna-
ment peculiar to the reigningInca, the lives and fortunes of the
people were at his difpoal.

All crimes ANOTHER consequence of establishing government in Peru
punflhed ca-
liially. on the foundation of religion, was, that all crimes were pu-

nifhed capitally. They were not confidered as transgressions
of human laws, but as insults offered to the Deity. Each,
without any diftindion between such as were flight and fiich
as were atrocious, called for vengeance, and could be expiated
only by the blood of the offender. Consonantly to the fame
ideas, punishment followed the trespass with inevitable ccr-

tainty, because an offence againit Heaven was deemed such an B o o K

high enormity as could not be pardoned . Among a people
of corrupted morals, maxims of jurisprudence so evere and
unrelenting, by rendering men ferocious and defpcrate, would
be more apt to multiply crimes than to restrain them. But the
Peruvians, of simple manners and unfufpicious faith, were
held in such awe by this rigid discipline, that the number of
offenders were cxtremely finall. Veneration for monarchs,
enlightened and directed, as they believed, by the divinity
whom they adored, prompted them to their duty; the dread
of punishment, which they were taught to confider as unavoid-
able vengeance inflicted by offended Heaven, withheld them
from evil.

THE system of superstition on which the Incas ingrafted Mild genius

of their rl-

their pretensions to such high authority, was of a genius very gion.
different from that eftabliflied among the Mexicans. Manco
Capac turned the veneration of his followers entirely towards
natural objeds. The Sun, as the great source of light, of joy,
and fertility in the creation, attraCted their principal homage.
The Moon and Stars, as co-operating with him, were entitled
to secondary honours. Wherever the propensity in the human
mind to acknowledge and to adore some siperior power, takes
this direction, and is employed in contemplating the order and
beneficence that really cxift in nature, the pirit of fuperflition
is mild. Wherever imaginary beings, created by the fancy and
the fears of men, are supposed to preside in nature, and become
the objeds of worflip, fuperflition always assumes a wilder and
more atrocious form. Of the latter we have an example among

B OK the Mexicans, of the former among the people of Peru. They

'L-M~-' had not, indeed, made such progress in observation or inquiry,

as to have attained jult conceptions of the Deity; nor was there
in their language any proper name or appellation of the Su-
preme Power, which intimated that they had formed any idea
of him as the Creator and Governor of the World '. But by
directing their veneration to that glorious luminary, which, by
its universal and vivifying energy, is the best emblem of divine
beneficence, the rites and observances which they deemed ac-
ceptable to him were innocent and humane. They offered to
the Sun a part of those productions which his genial warmth
had called forth from the bosom of the earth, and reared to
maturity. They sacrificed, as an oblation of gratitude, some
of the animals who were indebted to his influence for nourish-
merit. They presented to him choice specimens of those works
of ingenuity which his light had guided the hand of man in
forming. But the Incas never stained his altars with human
blood, nor could they conceive that their beneficent father the
Sun would be delighted with such horrid viCims g. Thus the
Peruvians, unacquainted with those barbarous rites which ex-
tinguifh sensibility, and suppress the feelings of nature at the
fight of human sufferings, were formed, by the spirit of the
fuperflition which they had adopted, to a national character
more gentle than that of any people in America.

Its influence ITS influence operated even upon their civil inflitutions, and
on ciil po tended to correct in them any thing that was adverse to gentleness

a forced fubjedion to the will of a superior; obedience, paid v .
to one who was believed to be clothed with divine authority,
was willingly yielded, and implied no degradation. The so-
vereign, conscious that the submissive reverence of his people
flowed from their belief of his heavenly descent, was continu-
ally reminded of a diftinaion which prompted him to imitate
that beneficent power which he was supposed to represent. In
consequence of those impreflions, there hardly occurs in the
traditional history of Peru, any instance of rebellion againt
the reigning prince, and, among twelve successive monarchs,
there was not one tyrant.

EVEN the wars in which the Incas engaged, were carried and use on
on with a spirit very different from that of other American their militari:

nations. They fought not, like savages, to destroy and exter-
minate; or, like the Mexicans, to glut blood-thirty divinities
with human sacrifices. They conquered, in order to reclaim
and civilize the vanquished, and to diffuse the knowledge of
their own institutions and arts. Prisoners seem not to have
been exposed to the insults and tortures, which were their lot
in every other part of the New World. The Incas took the
people whom they subdued under their protection, and ad-
mitted them to a participation of all the advantages enjoyed
by their original fubjeds. This practice, so repugnant to
American ferocity, and resembling the humanity of the most
polished nations, mull lbe ascribed, like other peculiarities
which we have observed in the Peruvian manners, to the genius
of their religion. The Incas, confidering the honiage paid to
any objcd but the heavenly powers which they adored, as in-
pious, were fond of gaining proselytes to their tfvourite sys-

A _--v- triumph to the great temple at Cuzco h, and placed there as

trophies of the superior power of the divinity who was the
protecdor of the empire. The people were treated with lenity,
and inffruded in the religious tenets of their new masters ', that
the conqueror might have the glory of having added to the
number of the votaries of his father the Sun.
Peculiar state THE state of property in Peru was no less singular than that

of religion, and contributed, likewise, towards giving a mild
turn of charaCter to the people. All the lands capable of cultiva-
tion were divided into three hares. One was consecrated to the
Suny and whatever it produced was applied towards the erecion
of temples, and furnishing what was requisite towards celebrat-
ing the public rites of religion. The other belonged to theInca, and
was set apart as the provision made by the community for the sup-
port of government. The third and largest iliare was reserved for
the maintenance of the people, among whom it was parcelled
out. No person, however, had a right of exclusive property
in the portion allotted to him. He possessed it only for a year,
at the expiration of which a new division was made in propor-
tion to the rank, the number, and exigencies of each family.
All those lands were cultivated by the joint indultry of the
community. The people, summoned by a proper officer, re-
paired in a body to the fields, and performed their common
task, while songs and musical infiruments cheered them to

and of mutual subserviency was continually inculcated. Each B o O K

VII.

individual felt his connecion with those around him, and I_-.
knew that he depended on their friendly aid for what increase
he was to reap. A state thus constituted may be confidered as
one great family, in which the union of members was so
complete, and the exchange of good offices so perceptible, as to
create stronger attachment, and to bind man to man in closer
intercourse, than fubfifled under any form of society efablifhed
in America. From this resulted gentle manners, and mild vir-
tues unknown in the savage state, and with which the Mexi-
cans were little acquainted.

BUT, though the institutions of the Incas were so framed Inequality of

as to strengthen the bonds ofaffection among their fuljeCs, there
was great inequality in their condition. The diflindion of
ranks was fully established in Peru. A great body of the in-
habitants, under the denomination of Yanaconas, were held in
a slate of servitude. Their garb and houses were of a form
different from those of free-men. Like the Tamemes of
Mexico, they were employed in carrying burdens, and in per-
forming every other work of drudgery '. Next to them in
rank, were such of the people as were free, but diflinngifhed
by no official or hereditary honours. Above them were railed,
those whom the Spaniards call Orejones, from the ornaments
worn in their ears. They formed what may be denominated
the order of nobles, and in peace, as well as war, held every
office of power or trust"'. At the head of all were the chil-
dren of the Sun, who, by their high descent, and peculiar pri-

Sta: of arts. SUCiH a form of society, from the union of its members, as

well as from the diftintion in their ranks, was favourable to
progress in the arts. But the Spaniards having been ac-
quainted with the improved state of various arts in Mexico,
several years before they discovered Peru, were not so much
itruck with what they observed in the latter country, and de-
scribe the appearances of ingenuity there with less warmth of
admiration. The Peruvians, nevertheless, had advanced far
beyond the Mexicans, both in the necessary arts of life, and in
fuch-as have some title to the name of elegant.

Improved IN Peru, agriculture, the art of primary neceflity in social
latefagri- life, was more extensive, and carried on with greater skill

than in any part of America. The Spaniards, in their progress
through the country, were so fully supplied with provisions
of every kind, that in the relation of their adventures we meet
with none of those dismal scenes of distress occasioned by fa-
mine, in which the conquerors of Mexico were so often in-
volved. The quantity of foil under cultivation was not left to the
discretion of individuals, but regulated- by public authority in
proportion to the exigencies of the community. Even the
calamity of an unfruitful season was but little felt, for the pro-
dut of the lands consecrated to the Sun, as well as thofc fct
apart for the Inca, being deposited in the Tambos, or pblic
storehouses, it remained there as a stated provilion for times
of scarcity . As the extent of cultivation was determicned \wih

vention and indufiry of the Peruvians were called forth to ex- -
traordinary exertions, by certain defccts peculiar to their cli-
nlate and foil. All the vast rivers that flow from the Andes
take their course eafiward to the Atlantic Ocean. Peru is wa-
tered only by some flreams which rush down from the nourn-
tains like torrents. A great part of the low-country is
sandy and barren, and never refreshed with rain. In order to
render such an unpromising region fertile, the ingenuity of the
Peruvians had recourse to various expedients. By means of
artificial canals conducted, with much patience and confidcr-

unknown to the Peruvians. They turned up the earth with
a kind of mattock of hard wood '. Nor was this labour deemed
so degrading as to be devolved wholly upon the women. Both

Their builJ-

er buil In the extensive plains which firetch along the Pacific Ocean,

where the sky is perpetually serene, and the climate mild, their
houses were very properly of a fabric extremely flight. But
in the higher regions, where rain falls, where the viciffitudeof
seasons is known, and their rigour felt, they were conftruded
with greater solidity. They were generally of a square form,
the walls about eight feet high, built with bricks hardened in
the fun, the door low and strait, and without any windows.
Simple as there flrurures were, and rude as the materials may
seem to be of which they were formed, they were so durable, that
many of them still subsist in different parts of Peru, long after
every monu ment that might have conveyed to us any idea of the
domestic fate of the other American nations has vanified from
the face of the earth. But it was in the temples consecrated to
the Sun, and in the buildings destined for the residence of their
monarchs, that the Peruvians displayed the utmost extent of
their art and contrivance. The descriptions of them by such
of the Spanish writers as had an opportunity of contemplating
them while, in some measure, entire, might have appeared
highly exaggerated, if the ruins which fill remain, did not
vouch the truth of their relations. These ruins of sacred or
royal buildings are found in every province of the empire,
and by their frequency demonfrate that they are monuments
of a powerful people, who must have subsisted, during a pe-
riod of ome extent, in a state of no inconsiderable improve-
ment. They appear to have been edifices various in their di-
mcnfions. Some of a moderate size, many of immense extent,
all remarkable for solidity, and resembling each other in the
flile of architecture. The temple of Pachacamac, together

with
3a6

with a palace of the Inca, and a fortress, were so conneced to- B 0 0 K
gether as to form one great ftruEture, above half a league in L.-.-
circuit. In this prodigious pile, the fame singular taste in build-
ing is conspicuous as in other works of the Peruvians. As
they were unacquainted with the use of the pulley, and other
mechanical powers, and could not elevate the large flones and
bricks which they employed in building to any considerable
height, the walls of this edifice, in which they seem to have
made their greatefl effort towards magnificence, did not rife
above twelve feet from the ground. Though they had not dif-
covered the use of mortar or of any other cement in building,
the bricks or flones were joined with so much nicety, that the
lears can hardly be discerned '. The apartments, as far as the
difiribution of them can be traced in the ruins, were ill-difpofed,
and afforded little accommodation. There was not a single
window in any part of the building, and as no light could en-
ter but by the door, all the apartments of largest dimension
must either have been perfecly dark, or illuminated by orne
other means. But with all these and many other impcrf&ions
that might be mentioned, in their art of building, the works
of the Peruvians which fill remain mutl be confidered as flu-
pendous efforts of a people unacquainted with the use of iron,
and convey to us an high idea of the power pofleffed by their
ancient monarchs.

THESE, however, were not the noblest or molf useful works Their l,

of the Incas. The two great roads fiom Cuzco to Quito, ex- r"ad''
tending in an uninterrupted firetch above five hundred leagues,
are entitled to fill higher praise. The one was conducted

--- ) through the plains on the ea-coaft. From the language of ad-

mriration in which some of the early writers exprelf their afto-
nifhment when they first viewed those roads, and from the
more pompous dcfcriptions of later writers, who labour to up-
port olme favourite theory concerning America, one might be
led to compare this work of the Incas to the famous military
ways which remain as monuments of the Roman power: But
in a country where there was no tame animal except the Llama,
which was never used for draught, and but little as a beast of bur-
den, where the high roads were eldom trod by any but a human
foot, no great degree of labour and art was requisite in forming
them-. The Peruvian roads were only fifteen feet in breadth ',
and in many places so slightly formed, that time oon effaced
every veflige of the course in which they ran., In the low
country little more seems to have been done, than. to pliant trees
or to fix potls at certain intervals, in order to mark the proper
route to travellers. To open a path through the mountainous
country was a more arduous talk. Eminencies were levelled,
and hollows filled up, and for the preservation of the road, it
was fenced with a bank of turf. At proper distances, Tambos,
or storehouses, were erected for the accommodation of the Inca
and his attendants, in their progress through his dominions.
From the manner in which the road was originally formed in
this higher and more impervious region, it has proved more
durable; and though, from the inattention of the Spaniards to
every objct& but that of working their mines, nothing has been
done towards keeping it in repair, its course may Hill be traced .

Such was the celebrated road of the Incas; and even from this B O K
description, divefled of every circumfiance of manifefi exagge-
ration, or of suspicious alipct, it mnut be confidered as a ftrik-
ing proof of an extraordinary progress in improvement and
policy. To the savage tribes of America, the idea of faci-
litating communication with places at a distance had never oc-
curred. To the Mexicans it was hardly known. Even in the
most civilized countries of Europe, men had advanced far
in refinement, before it became a regular object of na-
tional police to form such roads as render intercourse com-
modious.

The formation of those roads introduced another improvement and bidges.

in Peru equally unknown over all the reft of America. In its course
from south to north, the road of the Incas was interfeaed by all
the torrents which roll fiom the Andes towards the Western
Ocean. From the rapidity of their course, as well as from
the firequency and violence of their inundation, these were un-
navigable. Some expedient, however, was to be found for
pasing them. The Peruvians, from their unacquaintance
with the use of arches, and their inability to work in wood,
could not construct bridges either of stone or timber. But necef-
lity, the parent of invention, suggested a device which sup-
plied tlat defec. They formetl cablcs of great flrcngth, by
twifliiig together sone of the pliable withs or osiers, with
which their country abounds ; fix of which they firetched a-
cruss the itrcam parallel to one another, and made them fal on
each fide. Thcfe they bound firmly togethlr by interweaving
linallcr ropes so clolc, as to form a compa:c piece of net-work,
which being covered witl branches of' trees and arthl they

patlcd

B (i K pafled along it with tolerable security'. Proper persons were
'-----' appointed to attend at each bridge, to keep them in repair, and

to assist passengers . In the level country, where the rivers
became deep and broad and flill, they are passed in Balzas, or
floats; in the conflrution, as well as navigation of which, the
ingenuity of the Peruvians appears to be far superior to that of
any people in America. These had advanced no farther in
naval Ikill than the use of the paddle, or oar; the Peruvians
ventured to raise a malt, and spread a fail, by means of which
their balzas not only went nimbly before the wind, but could
veer and tack with great celerity '.

Mode of re- -NOR were the ingenuity and art of thePeruviansconfined sole-
fining silver
e re. ly to objecs of essential utility. They had made some progress

in arts, which may be called elegant. They possessed the pre-
cious metals in greater abundance than any people of America.
They obtained gold in the fame manner with the Mexicans, by
searching in the channels of rivers, or washing the earth in
which particles of it were contained. But in order to procure
silver, they exerted no inconsiderable degree of skill and in-
vention. They had not, indeed, attained the art of finking a
shaft into the bowels of the earth, and penetrating to the riches
concealed there; but they hollowed deep caverns on the banks
of rivers, and the fides of mountains, and emptied such veins as
did not dip suddenly beyond their reach. In other places,
where the vein lay near the furfacc, they dug pits to fucl a
depth, that the person who worked below could throw out the
ore, or hand it up in baskets'. They had discovered the art

ed with foreign fuibfances, by placing it in inMall ovens or fur-
naces on high grounds, so artificially conftruLued, that tile
draught of air performed the filnction of a. bellows, a machine
with which they were totally unacquainted. By this simple
device, the purer ores were fineltcd with such facility, that
the quantity of silver in Peru was so considerable, that
many of the utensils employed in the funfcions of common
life were made of it'. Several of those veflels and trinkets
are faidl to have merited no small degree of eflimation, on ac-
count of the neatness of the workmanllfip, as well as the in-
trinfic value of the materials. But as tle conquerors of Ame-
rica were well acquainted with the latter, but had scarcely any
conception of the former, most of them were melted down,
and rated according to their weight and fineness in the division
of the spoil.

tined for war, and others for labour. Some were of flint,
foine of copper, hardened to such a degree by an unknown
proccs, as to supply the place of iron on several occasions.
Had the use of thcfc tools formed of copper been general, the
progress of the Peruvians in the arts might have been fucli, as

V_. metal was
so rare, or the operation by which it was hardened

so tedious, that their infiruments of copper were few, and fu
extremely small, that they seem to have been employed only
in flighter works. But even to such a circumscribed use of
this imperfect metal, the Peruvians were indebted for their fu-
periority to the other people of America in various arts c. The
fame observation, however, may be applied to them, which ?
formerly made with refped to the arts of the Mexicans. From
several specimens of Peruvian utensils and ornaments, which
are deposited in the royal cabinet in Madrid, and from tome
preserved in different collecions in other parts of Europe, '
have reason to believe, that the workmanship is more to be ad-
mired on account of the rude tools with which it was executed,
than on account of its intrinsic neatness and elegance, and that
the Peruvians, though the most improved of all the Americans,
were not advanced beyond the infancy of arts.

country of immense extent, with only one city, the progress V---
of manners, and the improvement either of the necessary or
more refined arts, must have been so flow, and carried on un-
der such disadvantages, that it is more surprising the Peruvians

not proceed farther.

their manners, and the fewer their wants. The crafts of com-
mon and most necessary use in life do not, in such a slate, be-
come so complex or difficult, as to render it requisite that men
should be trained to them by any particular course of education.
All those profefflons were accordingly exercised by every Peru-
vian indiscriminately. None but the artists, employed in works
of mere curiosity or ornament, constituted a separate order of
men, or were diflinguifhed from other citizens e.

that the members of any community fettle in considerable num-
bers in one place, its operations become vigorous. The ci-

_
- produtions of art are regularly exchanged for the fruits

of agriculture. In the towns of the Mexican empire, flatad
markets were held, and whatever could supply any want or
desire of man was an oljeat of commerce. But in Peru, from
the singular mode of dividing property, and the manner
in which the people were fettled, there was cfarcely any
species of commerce carried on between different provinces',
and the community was less acquainted with that aCtive inter-
course, which is at once a bond of union, and an incentive to
improvement.

greater part of the rude nations in America opposed their in-
vaders with undaunted ferocity, though with little conduct or
success. The Mexicans maintained the struggle in defence of
their liberties, with such persevering fortitude, that it was with
difficulty the Spaniards triumphed over them. Peru was sub-
dued at once, and alnoft without resistance; and the mofe
favourable opportunities of regaining their freedom, and of
cruffling their opprcflbrs, were loft through the timidity of the
people. Though the traditional history of the Peruvians rc-
presents all the Incas as warlike princes, frequently at the head
of armies, which they led to vidory and conquest; few fymp-
toms of itch a martial spirit appear in any of their operations
fulbfequent to the invasion of the Spaniards. The influence,
perhaps, of those inflitutions which rendered their manners

gentle, gave their minds this unmanly softness; perhaps, the P ° ° ()
constant serenity and mildness of the climate may have ener- (
vatcd the rigour of their frame; perhaps, ome principle in
their government, unknown to us, was the occasion of this po-
litical dcbility. Whatever may have been the cause, the faa
is certain, and there is not an inflance in hiflory of any 'people
so little advanced in refinement, so totally defiitute of military
talents and enterprize. This charader hath descended to tlceir
pofierity. The Indians of Peru are now more tame and de-
prefled than any people of America. Their feeble ifirits, re-
laxed in lifeless inaaion, seem hardly capable of any bold or
manly exertion.

BUT, besides those capital defecs in the political slate of

Peru, ome detached circumfiances and fads occur in the Spa-
nifil writers, which discover a considerable remainder of barbari-
ty in their manners. The fame cruel custom, that prevailed in
fore of the moll savage tribes, subsisted among the Peruvians.
On the death of the Incas, and of other eminent persons, a
considerable number of their attendants were put to death,

sovereignty of Montezuma, or his predecessors. There regions, ---
not inferior in magnitude to all the Mexican empire, are re-
duced more or less completely under the Spaniflh yoke. They
extend through the most delightful part of the temperate zone;
their foil is, in general, remarkably fertile, and all their pro-
ductions, whether animal or vegetable, are most perfeCt in
their kind. They have all a communication either with the
Pacific Ocean, or with the Gulf of Mexico, and are watered by
such rivers as not only enrich them, but may become subser-
vient to commerce. The number of Spaniards fettled in those
vast countries, is indeed extremely small. They may be said
to have subdued, rather than to have occupied them. But if
the population in their ancient eflablifhments in America llall
continue to increase, they may gradually spread over those dif-
trids, of which, however inviting, they have not hitherto been
able to take poffefion.

ONE circumstance may contribute to the speedy population

of some distriCts. Very rich mines both of gold and silver have Rich mine.
been discovered in many of the regions which I have men-
tioned. Wherever these are opened, and worked with success,
a multitude of people retort. In order to supply them with
the necessaries of life, cultivation must be increased, artisans
of various kinds muff assemble, and industry as well as wealth
will be gradually diffused. Many examples of this have oc-
curred in different parts of America since they fell un-
der the dominion of the Spaniards. Populous villages and
large towns have suddenly arilcn amidst uninhabited wilds and
mountains; and the working of mines, though far fiom being
the most proper objet towards which the attention of an infant

focicty

B 0 0 K society should be turned, may become the means both of pro-
1---- moting useful aEivity, and of augmenting the number of people.
A recent anl A recent and singular inflance of this has happened, which, as
remarkablec
discovery. it is but little known in Europe, and may be produQive of

great effes, merits attention. The Spaniards fettled in the
provinces of Cinaloa and Sonora, had been long diflurbed by
the depredations of ome fierce tribes of Indians. In the year
1765, their incursions became so frequent, and so deftruive,
that the inhabitants, in despair, applied to the Maiquis de St.
Croix, viceroy of Mexico, for fich a body of troops as might
enable them to drive those for.nidable invaders fiom their
places of retreat in the mountains. But the treasury of Mexico
was so much exhaufied by the vafl fums drawn from it, in or-
der to support the late war against Great Britain, that the vice-
roy could afford them no aid. The refped due to his virtues,
accomplished what his official power could not ctFel. He pre-
vailed with the merchants to advance about two hundred thou-
sand pesos for defraying the expence of the expedition. The
war was conduced by an officer of abilities; and after being
protraCted for three years, chiefly by the difficulty of pursuing
the fugitives over mountains and through defiles which were
almost impaflable, it terminated in the year I77 1, in the final fil,-
mission of the tribes, which had been so long the objc of
terror to the two provinces. In the course of this service, tlic
Spaniards marched through countries into which they fecm not
to have penetrated before that time, and difcovcredl mines of
such value, as was aflonllirlg even to men acquaintc( with tlhe
riches contained in the mountains of the New World. At
Cineguilla, in the province of Sonora, they entered a plain of
fourteen leagues in extent, in which they found gold in grains,
at the depth of only fixtecn inches, of such a size, that fume

irX~~~~~~ ~~of

of them weighed nine marks, and in such quantities, that in a B 0 0 K
short time, with a few labourers, they colleted a thouland '-----
marks of gold in grains, even without taking time to wash the
earth that had been dug, which appeared to be so rich, that
persons of skill computed that it might yield what would be
equal in value to a million of pesos. Before the end of the
year 771, above two thousand persons were fettled in prolilble
Cineguilla, under the government of proper magistrates, e of
and the inspection of several ecclefiaflics. As several other
mines, not inferior in riches to that of Cineguilla, have been dif-
covered, both in Sonora and Cinaloak, it is probable that these
neglected and thinly inhabited provinces, may soon become as
populous and valuable as any part of the Spanish empire in
America.

THE peninsula of California on the other fide of the Vermi- C:lifornia,

its Ifatc,

lion ea, seems to have been less known to the ancient Mexi-
cans, than the provinces which I have mentioned. It was dif-
covered by Cortes in the year 1536 (Book V. p. 143).
During a long period it continued to be so little frequented, that
even its form was unknown, and in molt charts it was repre-
sented as an island, not as a peninsula '. Though the climate of
this country, if we may judge fiom its situation, mufl be very
desirable; the Spaniards have made finall progrcfs in peopling
it. Towards the close of the last century, the Jesuits, who had
great merit in exploring this negleted province, and in civilizing
its rude inhabitants, imperceptibly acquired a dominion over it
as complete as that which they poffeil'cd in their millions in 1a-

:B o l K raguay, and they laboured to introduce into it the fame policy,
(--w --' and to govern the natives by the fame maxims. In order to

prevent the court of Spain from conceiving any jealousy of their
designs and operations, they seem studiously to have depreciat-
ed the country, by representing the climate as so disagreeable
and unwholesome, and the foil as so barren, that nothing but
their zealous desire of converting the natives, could have in-
duced them to fettle there". Several public-fpirited-citizens en-
deavoured to undeceive their sovereigns, and to give them a

and probai- better view of California; but in vain. At length, on the ex-
iity of its im-
proving. pullion of the Jesuits from the Spanish dominions, the court of

Madrid, as prone at that juncture to fufpet the purity of the
Orders intentions, as formerly to confide in them with implicit
trust, appointed Don Joseph Galvez, whose abilities have since
raised him to the high rank of minister for the Indies, to visit that
peninsula. His account of the country was favourable; he found
the pearl fiflhery on its coasts to be valuable, and discovered mines
of gold of a very promising appearance". From its vicinity to
Cinaloa and Sonora, it is probable, that if the population of these
provinces fliall increase in the manner which I have supposed,
California may, by degrees, receive from them such a recruit of
inhabitants, as to be no longer reckoned among the desolate
and useless difirids of the Spanish empire.

fertility of their foil, or the richness of their mines, but they _.
yield in greater abundance, than any part of America, the log-
wood tree, which, in dying ome colours, is so far preferable to
any other material, that the consumption of it in Europe is con-
fiderable, and it has become an article in commerce of great
value. During a long period, no European nation intruded
upon the Spaniards in those provinces, or attempted to obtain
any share in this branch of trade. But after the conquest of Ja-
maica by the English, it soon appeared what a formidable rival
was now feated in the neighbourhood of the Spanish territories.
One of the firfi objets that tempted the English, was the great
profit arising from the logwood trade, and the facility of wresting
some portion of it from the Spaniards. Some adventurers from Their dco
Jamaica made the first attempt at Cape Catoche, the fouth-eafl dine,
promontory of Yucatan, and by cutting logwood there, carried
on a gainful traffic. When most of the trees near the coast in
that place were felled, they removed to the island of Trill, in

tion has been in the Bay of Honduras. The Spaniards, alarm-
ed at this encroachment, endeavoured by negociation, remon-
ftrances, and open force, to prevent the Englifl from obtaining
any footing on that part of the American continent. But after
firuggling againfl it for more than a century, the difaflcrs of

Chll. THE moss important province depending on the vice-royalty

of Peru, is Chili. The Incas had eftabliffed their dominion
in some of its southern diflrids; but in the greater part of the
country, its gallant and high-fpirited inhabitants maintained
their independence. The Spaniards, allured by the fame of
its opulence, early attempted the conquest of it under Diego Al-
magro ; and after his death, Pedro de Valdivia resumed the de-
sign. Both met with fierce opposition. The former relin-
quiihed the enterprize in the manner which I have mentioned r.
The latter, after having given many displays, both of courage

and military fill, was cut off with a considerable. body of B O O K
troops under his command. Francisco de Villagra, his lieu- _-
tenant, by his spirited condul, checked the natives in their
career, and saved the remainder of the Spaniards fi-om (cflruc-
tion. By degrees, all the champaign country along the coalt
was fubjeted to the Spanish dominion. The mountainous
country is still posseTsed by the Puelchles, Araucos, and other
tribes of its original inhabitants, formidable neighbours to the
Spaniards; with whom, during the course of two centuries,
they have been obliged to maintain perpetual hofility, suspend-
ed only by a few intervals of insecure peace.

THAT part of Chili then, which may properly be deemed a Excellenlce c

it, climli:e

Spanish province, is a narrow diiricd, extending along the coafl and Ibil.
from the desert of A tacamas to the island of Chiloe, above nine
hundred miles. Its climate is the most delicious of the New
World, and is hardly equalled by that of any region on the
face of the earth. Though bordering on the Torrid Zone, it
never feels the extremity of heat, being screened on the east by
the Andes, and refreshed from the weft by cooling fea-breezes.
The temperature of the air is so mild and equable, that theSpa-
niards give it the preference to that of the southern provinces
in their native country. The fertility of the foil corresponds
with the benignity of the climate, and- is wonderfully accommo-
dated to European produtions. The most valuable of these,
corn, wine, and oil, abound in Chili, as if they had been na-
tive to the country. All the fruits imported from Europe attain,
to full maturity there. The animals of our lheiifphcre nor oii-
ly multiply, but improve in this delightful region. The horn-
ed cattle are of larger size than thofl of Spain. Its breed of
horses filrpafles, both in beauty aud in (pirit, the fainous Anda-

of it.

glefed by apt to conclude, would early become a favourite station of the

ards.

letion and care. Instead of this, a great part of it remains
unoccupied. In all this extent of country, there are not above
eighty thousand white inhabitants, and about three times that
number of negroes and people of a mixed race. The most ser-
tile foil in America lies uncultivated, and some of its mofl pro-
mifing mines remain unwrought. Strange as this neglect of
the Spaniards to avail themselves of advantages, which seemed
to court their acceptance, may appear, the causes of it can be
traced. The only intercourse of Spain with its colonies in the
South Sea, was carried on during two centuries by the annual
fleet to Porto-bello. All the produce of the colonies were ship-
ped in the ports of Callao, or Arica in Peru, for Panama, and
carried from thence across the isthmus. All the commodities
which they received from the mother-country, were conveyed
from Panama to the fame harbours. Thus both the exports
and imports of Chili passed through the hands of the mer-
chants of Peru. These had of course a profit on each; and
in both tranfaaions the Chilefe 'felt their own fuborli-
nation; and having no direL intercourse with the parent
flatc, they depended upon another province for the clill)oial
of their pro)d!uiols, as well as far the flupply of their wants.

the colonies in the South Sea, by hips which go round Cape "'cilt
Horn, a direc intercourse is opened between Chili and the Mo-
ther-country. The gold, the silver, and the other commodi-
ties of the province will be exchanged in its own harbours
for the manufactures of Europe. Chili may speedily rife into
that importance among the Spaniflh settlements to which it is
entitled by its natural advantages. It may become the granary
of Peru, and the other provinces along the Pacific Ocean; it
may supply them with wine, with cattle, with horses, with
hemp, and many other articles for which they now depend up-
on Europe. Though the new system has been established only
a few years, those effed's of it begin already to be observed'.
If it shall be adhered to with any steadiness for half a century,
one may venture to foretell, that population, industry and
opulence will advance in this province with rapid progress.

To the east of the Andes, the provinces of Tucuman and Rio Provinces of

Tucumnan and

Vice-royalty of Peru. These regions of immense extent stretch Plata.

the sword, I chufe to rcferve my account of this northern di-
vilion, until I enter upon the hiflory of Portuguese America,
with which it is intimately connected; and, in relating it, I hall
be able from authentic materials, supplied both by Spain and
Portugal, to give a full and accurate description of the operations
and views of the Jesuits, in rearing that singular fabric of policy
in America, which has drawn so much attention, and has been so
imperfetly understood. The latter division of the province
contains the governments of Tucuman and Buenos-Ayres, aid
to these I shall at present confine my observations.
v i iw of the TH E Spaniards entered this part of America by the river De la

l.cr. Plata, and though a succession of cruel disasters besel them in their

early attempts to establish their dominion there, they were en-
couraged to persist in the design, at first by the hopes of discover-
ing mines in the interior country, and afterwards by the necessity
of occupying it, in order to prevent any other nation from fettling
there, and penetrating by this route into their rich poffefions
in Peru. But except Buenos-Ayres, they have made no fettle-
ment of any consequence in all the vast space which I have
mentioned. There are, indeed, scattered over it, a few places
on which they have bellowed the name of towns, and to which
they have endeavoured to add some dignity, by erecing thecn
into bihopricks; but they are no better than paltry vil-
lages, each with two or three hundred inhabitants. One cir-
cumflancc, however, which was not originally forefecn, has
contributed to render this diflridc, though thinly peopled, of
conliderable importance. The province of Tucuman, together
with the country to the south of the Plata, inltead of being

Id9~- ~covercle
336

covered with wood like other parts of America, forms one vast B o O K
open plain, almost without a tree. The foil is a deep fertile
mold, watered by many fireams descending from the Andes,
and clothed in perpetual verdure. In this rich pfturage, the
horses and cattle imported by the Spaniards from Europe have
multiplied to a degree which almost exceeds belief. This has
enabled the inhabitants not only to open a lucrative trade with
Peru, by supplying it with cattle, horses, and mules, but to
carry on a commerce no les beneficial, by the exportation of
hides to Europe. From both the colony has derived great ad-
vantages. But its commodious situation for carrying on con-
traband trade, has been the chieffource of its prosperity. While
the court of Madrid adhered to its ancient system, with refpea
to its communication with America, the river De la Plata
lay so much out of the course of Spanish navigation, that in-
terlopers, almost without any rifque of being either observed or
obftruaed, could pour in European manufactures in such quan-
tities, that they not only supplicd the wants of the colony, but
were conveyed into all the eastern diflriQs of Peru. \Vhen
the Portuguese in Brasil extended their settlements to the banks
of Rio de la Plata, a new channel was opened, by which pro-
hibited commodities flowed into the Spanili territories, with
still more facility, and in greater abundance. This illegal traffic,.
however detrimental to the parent slate, contributed to the in-
crease of the fettlemcnt, which had the immediate benefit of it,
and Buenos Ayres became gradually a populous and opulent
town. What may be the cffct of the alteration lately made in the
government of this colony, the nature of which lhall be dcfcrib-
cd in the fubfequcnt Book, cannot hitherto be known.

the latter, the New Kingdom of Granada, situated in the inte-
rior country. With a ihort view of these I shall close this part
-of my work.

To the eaff of Veragua, the last province subjed to the vicce
Darien. roy of Mexico, lies the isthmus of Darien. Though it was il

this part of the continent, that the Spaniards first began to plant
colonies, they have made no considerable progress in peopling;
it. As the country is extremely mountainous, deluged with
rain during a good part of the year, remarkably unhealthful,
and contains no mines of great value, they would probably
have abandoned it altogether, if they had not been allured to
continue by the excellence of the harbour of Porto-bello on the
one ea, and that of Panama on the other. These have been
called the keys to the communication between the north and
south ea, between Spain and her most valuable colonies. In
consequence of this advantage, Panama has become a confider-
able and thriving town. The peculiar noxiousness of its cli-
mate has prevented Porto-bello from increasing in the fame
proportion. As the intercourse with the settlements in the Pa-
cific Ocean, is now carried on by another channel, it is pro-
bable that both Porto-bello and Panama will decline, when no
longer nourished and enriched by that commerce, to whicli
they were indebted for their prosperity, and even their exifi-

ence.

tllis part of America to the crown of Spain, about the year
I532. It is thinly peopled, and of course ill cultivated. It
produces, however, a variety of valuable drugs, and some
precious stones, particularly emeralds. But its chief import-
ance is derived from the harbour of Carthagena, thefafeft and
bell fortified of any in the American dominions of Spain. In a
situation so favourable, commerce soon began to flourish. As
early as the year 1544, it fccms to have been a town of ome
note. But when Carthagcna was chosen as the port in which
the galcons (hould first begin to trade on their arrival from Eu-
rope, and to which they were directed to return, in order to
prepare for their voyage homeward, the commerce of its inha-
bitants was so much favoured by this arrangement, that it soon
became one of the mot populous, opulent, and beautiful cities
in America. There is, however, reason to apprehend, that it
has reached its highest point of exaltation, and that it will be
fb far asseRted by the change in the Spanish system of trade
with America, which has withdrawn from it the desirable visits
of the galeons, as to feel at least a temporary decline. But the
wealth now collected there, mull find or create employment for
itself, and may be turned witl advantage into tome new chan-
nel. Its harbour is so safe, and fb conveniently situated for re-
ceiving commodities from Europe, its merchants have been
so long accuf-omed to convey there into all the adjacent pro-
vinces, that it is probable they will flill retain this branch of
trade, and Carthagena continue to be a city of great im-
portance.

B 0 0 K THE province contiguous to Santa Martha on the east, was

.

. .first visited by Alonfo de Ojeda, in the year 1499 ; and the
Venezuela. Spaniards, on their landing there, having observed some huts in

an Indian village built upon piles, in order to raise them above
the tfagnated water which covered the plain, were led to beflow
upon it the name of Venezuela, or little Venice, by their usual
propensity to find a resemblance, between what they discovered
in America, and the objects which were familiar to them in
Europe. They made some attempts to fettle there, but with
little success. The final redudion of the province was accom-
plifhed by means very different from those to which Spain was
indebted for its other acquisitions in the New World. The
ambition of Charles V. often engaged him in operations of such
variety and extent, that his revenues were not sufficient to de-
fray the expence of carrying them into execution. Among
other expedients for supplying the deficiency of his funds, he
had borrowed large fums from the Velfers of Augfburgh, the
most opulent merchants at that time in Europe. By way of retri-
bution for these, or in hopes, perhaps, of obtaining a new loan,
he bestowed upon them the province of Venezuela, to be held
as an hereditary fief of the crown of Caffile, on condition that
within a limited lime they should render themselves maetcrs of
the country, and eflablifll a colony there. Under the direcion
of filch persons, it might have been expected, that a settlement
.would have been eflablifhed on maxims very different fronm
those of the Spaniards, and better calculated to encourage such
useful industry, as they might have known to be the only certain
source of prosperity and opulence. But unfortunately they com-
mitted the execution of their plan, to some of thole soldiers of

might speedily abandon a flation which they soon discovered to be
very uncomfortable, inflead of planting a colony that might have
cultivated and improved the country, wandered from diifri to
diftric in search of mines, plundering the natives with unfeel-
ing rapacity, or opprefing them by the imposition of intole-
rable talks. In the course of a few years, their avarice and
examtions, in comparison with which those of the Spaniards
were moderate, desolated the province so completely, that it
could hardly afford them fubfiflance, and the Velfers relinquifli-
ed a property, fiom which the inconsiderate condut of their
agents left them no hope of ever deriving any advantage".
When the wretched remainder of the Germans desertcd Ve-
nezuela, the Spaniards again took poftffion of it; but, notwith-
ltanding many natural advantages, it is one of their molt
languiihing and unproducive fcttlements.

tha on the north. As the original inhabitants of this region
were farther advanced in improvement, than any people in Ame-
rica but the Mexicans and Peruvians , they defended them-
selves with great resolution and good conduct. The abilities
and perseverance of Benalcazar and Quefada surmounted all op-
position, though not without encountering many dangers, and
reduced the country into the form of a Spanish province.

THE New Kingdom of Granada is so far elevated above the level

of the sea, that though it approaches almost to the equator, the
climate is remarkably temperate. The fertility of its vallies is not
inferior to that of the richest difirits in America, and its higher
grounds yield gold and precious stones of various kinds. It is
not by digging into the bowels of the earth that this gold is
found; it is mingled with the foil near the surface, and feparat-
ed from it by repeated waffing with water. This operation is
carried on wholly by negroe slaves; for though the chill fubter-
ranean air has been discovered, by experience, to be so fatal to
them, that they cannot be employed in the deep silver mines,
they are more capable of performing the other species of labour
than Indians. As the natives in the New Kingdom of Granada
arc exempt from that service, which has wafled their race o
rapidly in other parts of America, it is relnarkably populous.
Some diflricts yield gold with a profusion no lcis wonderful
than that in the vale of Cineguilla, which I have formerly men-
tioned, and it is often found inpLppilts, or grains, which mini-

to be worth seven hundred and forty pounds sterling. But with-
out founding any calculation on wlha is rare and extraordinary,
the value of the gold usually collectcd in this country, par-
ticularly in the provinces of Popayan and Choco, is of
confidcrable amount. Its towns are populous and flourish-
ing. The number of inhabitants in almoll every part of the
country daily increases. Cultivation and industry of various
kinds begin to be encouraged, and to prosper. A confidcrable
trade is carried on with Carthagcna, the produce of tlhe mines,
and other commoditics, being conveyed cdown tie great river of
St. Magdalen to that city. On another q(arter, the New King-

disastrous influence under which the connecion of the Ameri-
cans with the people of our hemisphere commenced, both in
the islands, and in several parts of the continent, and have
touched upon various causes of their rapid consumption. Where-
ever the inhabitants of America had resolution to take arms in
defence of their liberty and rights, many perilhed in the un-
equal contef, and were cut off by their fierce invaders.
But the greatest desolation followed after the sword was
heathed, and the conquerors were fettled in tranquillity.

andfomeparts tinent which firetched from the Gulf of Trinidad to the con-

were first and most sensibly felt. All these were occupied either
by wandering tribes of hunters, or by such as had made but
fmallprogrefs in cultivation and induffry. When they were
compelled by their new mailers to take up a fixed residence, and
to apply to regular labour; when tasks were imposed upon
them disproportioned to their firength, and were exaced with
unrelenting severity; they possessed not vigour either of mind
or of body to sustain this unusual load of oppression. Dejection
and despair drove many to end their lives by violence. Fatigue
and famine destroyed more. In all those extensive regions, the
original race of inhabitants wafted away; in some it was totally
extinguished. In Mexico, where a powerful and martial
people diflinguifled their opposition to the Spaniards, by efforts
of courage worthy of a better fate, great numbers fell in the
field; and there, as well as in Peru, ill greater numbers perifli-
ed under the hardships of attending the Spanish armies in their

rate policy with which they etabliihed their new fcttlements.
The former were temporary calamities, fatal to individuals;
the latter was a permanent evil, which, with gradual confump-
tion, wafted the nation. When the provinces of Mexico and
Peru were divided among the conquerors, each was eager to
obtain a diftria, from which he might expect an inflantaneous
recompence for all his services. Bold adventurers, accuflomed
to the careleflnefs and dissipation of a military life, had neither
industry tocarry on any plan of regular cultivation, nor patience
to wait for its flow, but certain returns. Inflead of fettling in the
vallies occupied by the natives, where the fertility of the foil
would have amply rewarded the diligence of the planter, they
chose to fix their flations in ome of the mountainous regions,
frequent both in New Spain and in Peru. To search for mines
of gold and silver, was the chief objea of their activity. The
vast prospects which this opens, and the alluring hopes which
it continually presents, correspond wonderfully with the spirit of
cnterprize and adventure that animated the first emigrants to Anic-
rica in every part of their conduc. In order to push forward those
favourite projects, so many hands were wanted, that the service of
the natives became indispensably requifitc. They were, according-
ly, compelled to abandon their ancient habitations in the plains,
and driven in crowds to the mountains. This fuddcn transition
from the fuiltry climate of the vallies, to the chill penetrating
air peculiar to high lands in the torrid zone; the fatigue of

exorbitant labour, scanty or unwholesome nourishment, and
the despondency occasioned by a species of oppression to which
they were not accutomed, and of which they saw no end, affeCted
them nearly as much as their less industrious countrymen in the
islands. They funk under the united pressure of those calamities,
and melted away with almost equal rapidity . In confequencc
of this, together with the introduction of the finall-pox, a ma-

lation that set bounds to their exactions and tyranny. The pa-
rent slate, with persevering attention, issued edias to prevent
the oppression of the Indians; the colonifis, regardless of these,
or trusting to their distance for impunity, continued to confider,
and treat them as slaves. The governors themselves, and other
officers employed in the colonies, several of whom were as in-
digent and rapacious as the adventurers over whom they prefid-
ed, were too apt to adopt their contemptuous ideas of the con-
quered people; and, intfead of checking, encouraged or con-
nived at their excefles. The desolation of the New World
fliould not then be charged on the court of Spain,or be confidered
as the effect of any fyfiem of policy adopted there. It ought to
be imputed wholly to the conquerors and first planters of Ame-
rica, who, by measures no less inconsiderate than unjust, coun-
teraced the edits of their Sovereign, and have brought disgrace
upon their country.

nor the es- WITH fill greater injustice, have many authors represented
fRe of eli- the intolerating spirit of the Roman Catholic religion, as the

cause of exterminating the Americans, and have accused the
Spanish ecclesiastics of animating their countrymen to the
slaughter of that innocent people, as idolaters and enemies of
God. But the first miflionaries who visited America, though
weak and illiterate, were pious men. They early espoused the
defence of the natives, and vindicated their character from the
aspersions of their conquerors, who, describing them as inca-
pable of being formed to the offices of civil life, or of compre-
hending the doctrines of religion, contended, that they were

set the mark of servitude. From the accounts which I have - -'
given of the humane and persevering zeal of the Spanish mif-
fionaries, in protecting the helpless flock committed to their
charge, they appear in a light which reflects lustre upon their
function. They were ministers of peace, who endeavoured to
wrest the rod from the hands of oppressors. To their power-
ful interposition, the Americans were indebted for every regu-
lation tending to mitigate the rigour of their fate. The clergy
in the Spanish settlements, regular as well as secular, arc tfill
confidered by the Indians as their natural guardians, to whom
they have recourse under the hardships and exaaions to which
they are too often exposed '.

Chiapa, Nicaragua, and the other delightful provinces of the
Mexican empire that stretch along the south-sea, the race of
Indians is still numerous. Their ettlements in ome places are
so populous, as to merit the name of cities . In the three au-
diences into which New Spain is divided, there are at least two
millions of Indians; a pitiful remnant, indeed, of its ancient po-
pulation, but uch as frill forms a body of people superior in
number to that of all the other inhabitants of this vast country' .

ferior stations in society. As the inhabitants, both of Mexico
and Peru were accustomed to a fixed residence, and to some de-
.gree of regular indultry, less violence was requisite in bringing
them to some conformity with the European modes of civil life.
But wherever the Spaniards fettled among the savage tribes of
America, their attempts to incorporate with them have been
always fruitless, and often fatal to the natives. Impatient of
refiraint, and disdaining labour as a mark of servility, they
either abandoned their original feats, and fought for independ-
ance in mountains and forests inaccessible to their oppressors, or
periflfed when reduced to a fate repugnant to their ancient ideas
and habits. In the diftrits adjacent to Carthagena, to Panama,
and to Buenos-Ayres, the desolation is more general than even
in those parts of Mexico and Peru, of which the Spaniards have
taken most full possession.

:Generalidea BUT the eflabliflments of the Spaniards in the New World,
of the policy
of Spain inits though fatal to its ancient inhabitants, were made at a period

colonis when that monarchy was capable of forming them to befi ad-

vantage. By the union of all its petty kingdoms, Spain was
become a powerful fate, equal to so great an undertaking. Its
monarchs, having extended their prerogative far beyond the li-
mits which once circumscribed the regal power in every king-
dom of Europe, were hardly subjed to controul, either in con-
certing, or in executing their measures. In every wide extend-
ed empire, the form of government muff be simple, and the au-
thority of the sovereign absolute; that his resolutions may be
taken with promptitude, and pervade the whole with undirni-
nifhed force. Such was the power of the Spanilh monarchs,

when
3;2

when they were called to deliberate concerning the mode of B K
establishing their dominion over the molt remote provinces, ...-
that had ever been fubjeded to any European fate. In this de-
liberation, they felt themselves under no constitutional restraint,
and that as independent masters of their own resolves, they
might ifue the edidts requisite for modelling the government of
the new colonies, by a mere act of prerogative.

Tnes early interposition of the Spanith crown, in order to Early inter-

regulate the policy and trade of its colonies, is a peculiarity pofitionl1ofth'
which diflinguifhes their progress from that of the colonies of rty.
any other European nation. When the Portuguese, the English,
and French, took possession of those regions in America which
they now occupy, the advantages which they promised to yield
were so remote and uncertain, that they were suffered to struggle
through a hard infancy, almost without guidance or protection
from the parent slate. But gold and silver, the first productions
of the Spanish settlements in the New World, were more allur-
ing, and immediately attracted the attention of their monarchs.
Though they had contributed little to the discovery, and almost
nothing to the conquest of the New World, they inflantly as-
fumed the fundcion of its legislators; and having acquired a
species of dominion formerly unknown, they formed a
plan for exercising it, to which nothing similar occurs in the
history of human affairs.

THrE fundamental maxim of Spanish jurisprudence with re- All powet

fpea to America, is to confider what has been acquired there ncd prinpety
as veiled in the crown, rather than in the slate. By the crown"
bull of Alexander VI. on which, as its great charter, Spain
founded its right, all the regions that had been, or hould

the universal proprietors of the vail territories, which the arms
of their ifbjeds conquered in: the New World. From tlhem,
all grants of land there flowed, and to them they finally return-
ed. The leaders who conduaed the various expeditions, the
governors who presided over the different colonies, the oficeCa
ofjuflice, and the mniniflers of religion, were all appointed by
their authority, and removable at their pleasure. The people
who composed infant settlements were intitled to no privileges
independent of the fovercign, or that served as a barrier againil
the power of the crown. It is true, that when towns were
built, and formed into bodies corporate, the citizens were per-
mitted to elect their own magiflrates, who governed by laws
which the community enacted. Even in the most despotic
states, this feeble spark of liberty is not extinguished. But in
the cities of Spanish America, this jurifdidon is merely muni-
cipal, and is confined to the regulation of their own interior
commerce and police. In whatever relates to public govern-
inent, and the general interest, the will of the overeign is law.
No political power originates from the people. All centres in
the crown, and in the officers of its nomination.

nals similar to those in Spain. The conduct of civil affairs
in the various provinces and diftrils, into which the Spanish
dominions in America are divided, is committed to magistrates
of various orders and denominations; some appointed by the
king, others by the viceroy, but all subjeCt to his command,
and amenable to his jurifdiaion. The administration ofjuftice
is vefed in tribunals, known by the name of Audiences, and
formed upon the model of the court of Chancery in Spain.
These are eleven in number, and dispense justice to as many
dirtias, into which the Spanish dominions in America are di-
vided . The number of judges in them is various, according
to the extent and importance of their jurifdition. The flation
of a judge in the court of Audience is no less honourable than
lucrative, and is commonly filled by persons of such abilities and
merit, as renders this tribunal extremely refpeaable. Both ci-

ture to assume. In order to check an usurpation which must i
have annihilated jufiice and security in the Spanish colonies, by
fubjeting the lives and property of all to the will of a single
man, the viceroys have been prohibited, in the most explicit
terms,, by repeated laws, from interfering in the judicial pro-
ceedings of the courts of Audience, or from delivering an opi-
nion, or giving a voice with refpeC to any point litigated be-
fore them'. In ome particular cafes, in which any question
of civil right is involved, even the political regulations of the
viceroy may be brought under the review of the court of Au-
dience, which, in those instances, may be deemed an interme-
diate power placed between him and the people, as a conflitu-
tionalbarrier tocircumfcribe his jurifdidion. But aslegal restraints
on a person who represents the sovereign, and is clothed with
his authority, are little suited to the genius of Spanish policy;
the hesitation and reserve with which it confers this power on
the courts of Audience, are remarkable. They may advise,
they may remonfirate, but in the event of a dire& collision be-
tween their opinion and the will of the viceroy, what he deter-
mines muff be carried into execution, and nothing remains for
them, but to lay the matter before the king and the council of
the Indies". But to be intitled to remonstrate, and inform
against a person, before whom all others muff be silent, and
tamelyfubmit to his decrees, is a privilege which adds dignity to
the courts of Audience. This is farther augmented by another
circumfiance. Upon the death of a viceroy, without any provi-

SucH is thegreat outline of that system of government, which

Spain has eflablifhed in her American colonies. To enumerate
the various subordinate boards and officers employed in the ad-
miniifration ofjuflice, in collecing the public revenue, and in
regulating the interior police of the country, to describe their
different functions, and to inquire into the mode and effe of
their operations, would prove a detail no less intricate than mi-
nute and uninterefling.

FirI obje&, TIE firfi object of tle Spanish monarchs was to secure
o secure an the productions of the colonies to the parent slate, by an abfo-
trade. lute prohibition of any intercourse with foreign nations. They

took possession of America by right of conquest, and conscious
of the feebleness of their infant settlements, and aware of the
difficulty in establishing their dominion over such vast regions,
or of retaining so many reluctant nations under the yoke, they
dreaded the intrusion of firangers; they even shunned their in-
fpedion, and endeavoured to keep them at a distance from their
coasts. This spirit ofjealoufy and exclusion, which at firfi was
natural, and perhaps necessary, augmented as their possessions
in America extended, and the value of them came to be more
fully understood. In consequence of it, a system of colonizing
was introduced, to which there had hitherto been nothing fimi-
lar among mankind. In the ancient world, it was not uncom-
mon to fend forth colonies. But they were of two kinds only.
They were either migrations, which served to disburden a slate

of its superfluous fubjccs, when they multiplied too salt for B 0 0 K
the territory which they occupied : or they were military de- ^
tachmcnts stationed, as garrisons, in a conquercd province. The
colonies of some Greek republics, and the swarms of northern
barbarians which fcttled in difiercnt parts of Europe, were of
the firlft species. The Roman colonies were of the second. In
the former, the connection with the mother-country quickly
ceased, and they became independent fiates. In the latter, as
the disjuntion was not complete, the dependence continued. In
their American fcttlcmcnts, the Spanish monarchs took lwhat was Rcgulations

for that pur-

peculiar tocachi, and flulied to unite them. By flnding colonies to pore.
regions lo remote, by cflablifhing in each a form of intcrior
policy and adininifiration, under dliflinCt governors, and witli
peculiar laws, they disjoinedc ther fiomn the mother-country.
BIy rctaining in their own lhands the rights of Icgiflation, as
well as that of impoing taxes, together with the power of no-
minating the persons who filled every department, civil or mili-
tary, they securcd their dependence. Happily for Spain, the
situation of her colonies was such, as rendered it poflible to
reduce this new idea into pracice. Ailnofl all the countries
which flle ad discovercd and occupied, lay within the tropics.
Thle produlins of that large portion of the globe, are different
from thol of Europe, even in its niofl futlhern provinces. The
qu.lities of the climate and of the lil naturally turn the in-
(dflry of tliobc wlho fettle there into new channels. When the
Spaniards iril took polfcfl in of their domains in lAmerica, the
prccios t a

_-b---' to wafle their indufiry on what was less lucrative, but of fupe-

rior moment. In order to render it impoflible to corret this
error, and to prevent them from making any efforts that might
interfere with those of Spain, the eflablifhment of several species
of manufactures, and even the culture of the vine, or olive,
are prohibited in the colonies , under evere penalties '. They
muff trust entirely to the mother-country for the objects of pri-
mary necessity. Their clothes, their furniture, their infiru-
ments of labour, their luxuries, and even a considerable part of
the provisions which they consume, were imported from Spain.
During a great part of the sixteenth century, Spain poffefling
an extensive commerce and flourishing manufacturcs, could
supply with ease the growing demands of her colonies, from
her own fores. The produce of their mines and plantations
was given in exchange for these. But all that the colonies re-
ceived, as well as all that they gave, was conveyed in Spanish
bottoms. No vessel belonging to the colonies was ever per-
mitted to carry the commodities of America to Europe. Even
the commercial intercourse of one colony with another, was
either absolutely prohibited, or limited by many jealous reftric-
tions. All that America yields flows into the ports of Spain;
all that it consumes mutt issue from them. No foreigner can
enter one of its colonies without express permission; no vcffcl
of any foreign nation is received into their harbours; and the
pains of death, with confiscation of moveables, are denounced
against every inhabitant who presumes to trade with them".
Thus the colonies are kept in a tate of perpetual pupillage;

and

and by the introduction of this commercial dependence, a re- °o ° K
finement in policy of which Spain set the first example to the '----
European nations, the supremacy of the parent slate hath been
maintained over remote colonies du:ing two centuries and a
half.

SUCH are the capital maxims to which the Spanish monarchs stow proorers

of pzpulatiori

seem to have attended in forming their new settlements in Ame- from Eumop.o
rica. But they could not plant with the fame rapidity that they
had destroyed; and, from many concurring caures, their pro-
grefs was extremely flow, in filling up the immense void which
their devaflations had occasioned. As soon as the rage for disco-
very and adventure began to abate, the Spaniards opened their
eyes to dangers and distresses, which at first they did not per-
ceive, or had despised. The numerous hardships witl which
the members of infant colonies have to firuggle, the diseases of
unwholesome climates, fatal to the conflitution of Europeans;
the difficulty of bringing a country, covered with forefis, into
culture; the want of hands neceflary for labour in some pro-
vinces, and the flow reward of industry in all, unless where the
accidental discovery of mines enriched a few fortunate adven-
turers, were evils universally felt and magnified. Discouraged
by the view of these, the spirit of migration was so much damp-
ed, that sixty years after the discovery of the New World, the
number of Spaniards in all its provinces is computed not to have
exceeded fifteen thousand .

u..-- tremely unfavourable to population. In order to promote a ra-

pitl increase of people in any new settlement, property in land
ought to be divided into finall hares, and the alienation of it
fiould be rendered extremely easy '. But the rapacioufne.s of
the Spanish conquerors of the New World paid no regard to
this fundamental maxim of policy; and, as tlcy poffeled power,
which enabled them to gratify the utmost extravagance of their
wishes, many of them seized diflrits and provinces of vast cx-
tent, and held them as ecomienllas. By degrees they obtained
the privilege of converting a part of there into Ma)yorfros, a
fpeeies of fief, introduced into the Spanifl fyfernm of feudal
jurisprudence , which can neither be divided nor alienated.
Thus a great portion of landed property, under this rigid form
of entail, is withheld from circulation, and descends from fa-
ther to son unimproved, and of little value either to the proprie-
tor or to the community. In the account which I have given
of the reduction of Peru, various examples occur of enormous
tracs of country occupied by ome of the conquerors'. The
excesses in other provinces were imilar, for as the value of the
lands which they acquired, was originally eflimated according
to the number of Indians which lived upon them, America was
in general so thinly peopled, that only diftrias of great extent
could afford fueh a number of labourers, as might be employed
in the mines with any profpeac of considerable gain. The per-
nicious effects of those radical errors in the distribution and
nature of property in the Spanifl settlements, are felt through
every department of industry, and may be confidered as one

burden on the Spanish colonies, which has greatly rctarded tle Fo'iy
progress of population and industry. The paymcnt of tythes is
a heavy tax on induflry ; and if the exaCtion of them be not re-
gulated and circumscribed by the wifom of the civil magi-
firate. it becomes intolerable and ruinous. But, instead of any
reflraint on the claims ofecclefiaftics, the inconsiderate zeal of
the Spanish legislators admitted them into America in their full
extent, and at once imposed on their infant colonies a burden
which is in no flight degree oppressive to society even in its
most improved site. As early as the year 15or, the payment
of tythes in the colonies was enjoined, and the mode of it re-
gulated by law, and every article of primary neccifity, towards
which the attention of new settlers must naturally be turned, is
fubjeted to that grievous exadion . Nor were the demands of
the clergy confined to articles of simple culture. Its more artificial
and operose productions; such as sugar, indigo, and cochineal,
were soon declared to be tythable ; and thus the industry of the
planter was taxed in every flage of its progress, from its rudefl
essay to its highet improvement. To the weight of this legal
imposition, the bigotry of the American Spaniards has made many
voluntary additions. From their fond delight in the external
pomp and parade of religion, and from filpcrflitious reverence for

Various or- BUT so fertile and inviting are the regions of America, which
ders of peo-
pie in the co- the Spaniards have occupied, that notwithstanding all the cir-
lonies. cumftances, which have checked and retarded population, it

has gradually increased, and filled the colonies of Spain with
citizens of various orders. Among these, the Spaniards, who

Chapetones arrive from Europe, distinguished by the name of Chapetones,
he firfE. are the first in rank and power. From the jealous attention of

the Spanish court to secure the dependence of the colonies, every
department ofconfequence is filled by persons sent from Europe;
and in order to prevent any of dubious fidelity from being em-
ployed, each must bring proof of a clear descent from a family of
Old ChrOijians, untainted with any mixture of Jewish or Maho-
metan blood, and never disgraced by any censure of the inquifi-
tion . In such pure hands, power is deemed to be safely lodged,
and almost every public function, from the viceroyalty downwards,
is committed to them alone. Every person, who by his birth,
or residence in America, may be suspeCted of any attachment or
interest adverse to the mother-country, is the object of distrust
to such a degree, as amounts nearly to an exclusion from all of-
sices ds confidence or authority '. By this conspicuous predilec-
tion of the court, the Chapetones are raised to such pre-eminence
in America, that they look down with disdain on every other
order of men.

yet, by the enervating influence of a sultry climate, by the ri-
gour of a jealous government, and by their depair of attaining
that diflindion to which mankind naturally apire, the vigour
of their minds is so entirely broken, that a great part of them
waite life in luxurious indulgences, mingled with an illiberal
fuperfiition still more debasing. Languid and unenterprizing,
the operations of an alive extended commerce would be to
them o cumbersome and oppreffivc, that in almost every part of
America they decline engaging in it. The interior traffic of
every colony, as well as its trade with the neighbouring pro-
vinces, and with Spain itself, are carried on chiefly by the Cha-
petones g; who, as the rccompcnce of their indurfly, amass
immense wealth, while the Creoles, funk in sloth, arc satisfied

VIII.
s- ,-_-. refinement of distrustful policy, cherishes those feeds of discord,

and foments this mutual jealousy, which not only prevents the
two most powerful classes of its fubjeas in the New World fiomn
combining against the parent state, but prompts each with the
moll vigilant zeal, to observe the motions and to counteract the
schemes of the other.

A mnxed racc THE third class of inhabitants in the Spanifli colonies is a

third order mixed race, the offspring either of an European and a negroc,

or of an European and Indian, the former called Mulatocs,
the latter Mejiizos. As the court of Spain, solicitous to incor-
porate its new vassals with its ancient fubjees, early encourag-
ed the Spaniards fettled in America to marry the natives of that
country, several alliances of this kind were formed in their i-
sant colonies'. But it has been more owing to licentious i-
dulgence, than to compliance with this injunction of their f,..
vereigns, that this mixed breed has multiplied so greatly, as t,
constitute a considerable part of the population in all the Splinii
settlements. The several ftagesofdefcent in this race, and the
gradual variations of slade until the African black, or the cop-
per-colour of America, brighten into an European complcioll,
are accurately marked by the Spaniards, and each liftinguiilic(
by a peculiar name. Those of the first generation are now con-
fidered, and treated as Indians and negroes; but in the third
descent, the charaderiflic hue of the former disappears; and il
the fifth, the deeper tint of the latter is so entirely cflacedl, lthat

titled to all their privileges k. It is chiefly by this mixed race, B O O
whose frame is remarkably robust and hardy, that the mechanic _,
arts are carried on, and other ative funcions in society are
discharged, which the two higher claies of citizens, from
pride, or from indolence, disdain to exerciie'.

THE negroes hold the fourth rank among the inhabitants of Ne.tocs

the Spanish colonies. The introdudcion of that unhappy part dtlet0o"' or-
of the human species into America, together with their services
and sufferings there, hall be fully explained in another place;
here they are mentioned chiefly, in order to point out a peculia-
rity in their situation under the Spanish dominion. In several
of their settlements, particularly in New Spain, negroes are
chiefly employed in domeflic service. They form a principal
part in the train of luxury, and are cherished and carefled
by their superiors, to whose vanity and pleafurea they are equal-
ly subservient. Their dress and appearance is hardly less fplenr
did than that of their maters, whose manners they imitate,
and whose passions they imbibe". Elevated by this diflincion,
they have assumed such a tone of superiority over the Indians,
and treat them with such iniblence and scorn, that the anti-
pathy between the two races has become implacable. Even in
Peru, where negroes are more numerous, and employed in field-
work as well as domeflic service, they maintain their accndl-
ant over the Indians, and their mutual hatred sublists witl
equal violence. The laws lave induftriouny fomented this

have already traced the progress of the Spanish ideas with re-
fpet to the condition and treatment of that people, and
have mentioned the most important of their more early regula-
tions, concerning a matter of so much consequence in the ad-
ministration of their new dominions. But since that period to
which I have brought down the history of America, the infor-
mation and experience acquired during two centuries, have
enabled the court of Spain to make such improvements in this
part of its American system, that a short view of the present
condition of the Indians may prove both curious and in-
terefiing.

querors of the New World, who confidered its inhabitants as
slaves, towhofe service they had acquired a full right of pro-
perty, were finally abrogated. From that period, the Indians
have been reputed freemen, and intitled to the privileges of sub-
jeds. When admitted into this rank, it was deemed jufi, that
they should contribute towards the support and improvement

of the society, which had adopted them as members. But as B O O K
no considerable benefit could be expecded from the voluntary -,
efforts of men, unacquainted with regular induflry, and averse
to labour, the court of Spain found it necesSary to fix and fe-
cure, by proper regulations, what ic thought reasonable to exact
from them. With this view, an annual tax was imposed up- 'rT:, importd
on every male, from the age of eighteen to fifty; and, at the
fame time, the nature as well as extent of the services which
they might be required to perform, were ascertained with pre-
cifion. This tribute varies in different provinces, but if we
take that paid in New Spain as a medium, its annual amount
is nearly four shillings a head, no exorbitant fum in countries
where, as at the source of wealth, the value of money is ex-
tremely low °. The right of levying it likewise varies. In
America, every Indian is either an immediate vassal of the
crown, or depends upon some subjec to whom the dilfrid, in
which he resides, has been granted for a limited time, under
the denomination of enconziezda. In the former cafe, about
three-fourths of the tax is paid into the royal treafuiry; in the
latter, the fame proportion of it belongs to the holder of
the grant. When Spain first took poifielion of America,
the greater part of it was parcelled out among its conquerors,
or those who first fettled there, and but a fnall portion referv-
ed for the crown. As those grants which were made for two
lives only , reverted successively to the fovercign, he had it in
his power either to diffuse his favours by grants to new pro-
prietors, or to augment his own revenue by valuable anncxa-

ing to the fame rule observed in the payment of tribute. Those
services, however, which can now be legally exated, are very
different from the servile talks originally imposed upon the In-
dians. The nature of the work which they must perform is
defined, and an equitable recompence is granted for their la-
bour. The Rated services demanded of the Indians, may be
divided into two branches. They are either employed in works
of primary necessity, without which society cannot subsist com-
fortably, or are compelled to labour in the mines, from which
the Spanish colonies derive their chief value and importance.
In consequence of the former, they are obliged to assist in the
culture of maize, and other grain of necessary consumption; in
tending cattle, in ereEting edifices of public utility, in build-
ing bridges, and in forming high roads'; but they cannot be
constrained to labour in raising vines; olives, and fiugar-canes,
or any species of cultivation, which has for its objet the grati-
fication of luxury, or commercial profit '. In consequence of the
latter, the Indians are compelled to undertake the more unplea-
lant task, of extracing ore from the bowels of the earth, and

under regulations framed with a view of rendering it as little
opprefive as possible to the Indians. They are called out al-
ternately in divisions, termed Mitas, and no person can be
compelled to go but in his turn. In Peru, the number called
out must not exceed the fcventh part of the inhabitants in any
dilri'i". In New Spain, where the Indians are more nume-
rous, it is fixed at four in the hundred . During what time
the labour of those Indians, who are employed in agriculture,
continues, I have not been able to learn Y. But in Peru, each
Mita, or division, dcflined for the mines, remains there fix
months; and while engaged in this service, a labourer never
receives less than two shillings a day, and often earns more than
double that fim '. No Indian, residing at a greater diflance
than thirty miles from a mine, is included in the Mita, or divi-
sion employed in working it'; nor are the inhabitants of the
low country exposed to certain deftruAion, by compelling themn
to remove from that warm climate, to the cold elevated regions
where minerals abound

under them, according to maxims of justice, transmitted to
them by tradition from their ancestors. To the Indians, this
jurisdiCtion, lodged in such friendly hands, affords ome con-
folation; and so little formidable is this dignity to their new
mailers, that they often allow it todefcend by hereditary right '.
.For the farther relief of men so much exposed to opprefflon,
the Spanish court has appointed an officer in every diftrit, with
the title.of Protetor of the Indians. It is his funlion, as the
name implies, to assert the rights of the Indians, to appear in
their defence in the courts ofjuftice; and, by the interposition
of his authority, to set bounds to the encroachments and exac-
tions of his countrymen'. A certain portion of the reserved
fourth of the annual tribute, is deflined for the salary of the
caziques and protectors, another is applied to the maintenance
of the clergy employed in the inftrusion of the Indians '. An-
other part seems to be appropriated for their support, and the
payment of their tribute in years of famine, or when a particu-
lar difiria is affeaed by any extraordinary calamity '. Betides
this, provision is made by various laws, that hospitals shall be
founded in every new settlement for the reception of Indians .
Such hospitals have accordingly been ereted, both for the indi-
gent and infirm in Lima, in Cuzco, and in Mexico, where the
Indians are treated with tenderness and humanity''.

SUCH is the great outline of the jurisprudence and policy
by which the Indians are now governed in the provinces be-

longing to Spain. In those regulations of the Spanish mo- n 0 K
narchs, we discover no traces of that cruel system of extermina- '---
tion, which they have been charged with adopting; and if we
admit, that the necessity of securing subsistence for their colo-
nies, or the advantages derived from working the mines, give
them a right to avail themselves of the labour of the Indians,
we must allow, that the attention with which they regulate and
recompence that labour, is provident and sagacious. In no code
of laws is greater solicitude displayed, or precautions multiplied
with more concern for the preservation, the security, and the
happiness of the subjee, than we discover in the collection of
the Spanish laws for the Indies. But those later regulations,
like the more early edits which have been already mentioned,
have too often proved ineffectual remedies against the evils
which they were intended to prevent. In every age, if the fame
causes continue to operate, the fame effecs must follow. From
the immense distance between the power entrusted with the
execution of laws ; and that, by whose authority they are
enacted, the vigour even of the modl absolute government must
relax, and the dread of a superior too remote to observe with
accuracy, or to punish with dispatch, mull insensibly abate.
Notwithflanding the numerous injunlions of the Spanifi mo-
narchs, the Indians flill suer, on many occasions, both from
the avarice of individuals, and from the exaaions of the magif-
trates, who ought to have prote&ed them ; unrcafonable
tasks are imposed ; the term of their labour is prolonged, and
they groan under all the insults and wrongs whlich are the lot
of a dependent people'. From foine informatiun on which
I can depend, such oppression abounds nore in lPeru, tlha
in any other colony. But it is not general. Accord-

several provinces, enjoy not only ease, ut affluence; they pof-
fess large farms; they are masters of numerous herds and

European arts and industry, are supplied not only with the nc-

Ecckrfiafical AFTER explaining the form of civil policy in the Spanish
con litution
o the col0- colonies, and the state of the various orders of persons ifubjet
ni'e. to it, the peculiarities in their ecclesiastical constitution merit

coufideration. Notwithstanding the superstitious veneration
with which Spaniards are devoted to the Holy See, the vi-
gilant and jealous policy of Ferdinand early prompted him to
take precautions against the introduction of the papal d6minion

Reflr:nti on into America. With this view, he solicited Alexander VI. for
the papal ju-
rl;UJicin. a grant of the tythes in all the newly-difcovered countries',

which he obtained on condition of his making provision
for the religious inftruaion of the natives. Soon as-
ter, Julius II. conferred on him the right of patronage,
and absolute disposal of all ecclesiastical benefices there m. Both
there pontiffs, unacquainted with the value of what he demand-
ed, bellowed those donations with an inconsiderate liberality,
which their successors have often lamented, and wished to recal.
In consequence of those grants, the Spanifl monarchs have be-
come, in cffect, the heads of the American church. In them
the adminifration of its revenues is veiled. Their nomination
of persons to supply vacant benefices is instantly confirmed by

ly superior, his name alone is heard, and no dependence upon
any foreign power has been introduced. Papal bulls can-
not be admitted into America, nor arc they of any force there,
until they have been previously examined, and approved of by
the royal council of the Indies ; and if any bull should be fur-
rcptitioufly introduced, and circulated in America without ob-
taining tlat approbation, ecclefiafiics are required not only to
prevent it from taking cflFed, but to seize all the copies of it,
and transmit them to the council of the Indieso. To this limi-
tation of the papal jurisdiction, equally singular whether we
confider the age and nation in which it was dcvifed, or the jea-
lous attention wi;h which Ferdinand, and his successors, have
studied to maintain it in full force P, Spain is indebted, in a great

VIII.
----' retirement and indolence of academic life, are more incapable

of active enterprize, and less disposed to firike into new paths,
than any order of men, the ecclefiaflical adventurers by whom
the American church is recruited, are commonly such as, from
merit or rank in life, have little profpet of success in their
ofthe fcu- own country. Accordingly, the secular priests in the New

World are still less distinguished than their brethren in Spain,
for literary accomplishments of any species; and though, by
the ample provision which has been made for the American
church, many of its members enjoy that ease and independence,
which is favourable to the cultivation of science; the body of
secular clergy has hardly, during two centuries and a half, pro-
duced one author whose works convey such useful information,
or possess such a degree of merit, as to be ranked among those
which attract the attention of enlightened nations. But the
greatest part of the ecclesiastics in the Spanish settlements are re-
of the regu gulars. On the discovery of America, a new field opened to the

pious zeal of the monastic orders; and, with a becoming ala-
crity, they immediately sent forth missionaries to labour in
it. The first attempt to instruct and convert the Americans,
was made by monks; and, as soon as the conquest of any pro-
vince was completed, and its ecclesiastical establishment began to
aftume some form, the popes, as a reward of their service, per-
mitted the miflionaries of the four mendicant orders, to accept
of parochial charges in America, to 'perform all spiritual func-
tions, and to receive the tythes, and other emoluments of the
benefice, without depending on the jurifdidion of the bihop of
the diocese, or being fbjec to his cenfuies. In confcquence of

its frivolous functions, offer their service with eagernels, and re-

do they pursue them without success. The highel eccleCiaflical
honours, and mos: lucrative preferments in Mlexico and Peru,
are often in the hands of regulars; and to them chiefly the
Americans are indebted for any portion of fcicnce that is cul-
tivated among them. They are almost the only Spanili
ecclefiaflics, from whom we have received any accounts either
of the civil or natural hiflory of the various provinces in Ame-
rica. Some of them, though deeply tinged with the indelible
fuperlition of their profellion, have publiflhed books which

more accurate observations, perhaps, and more found science,

lifhed in the sixteenth century.

the Spanish fettlemcnts, are not only dellitute of the virtues be-
coming their profcfflion, but regardless of that external decorum
and -refpec: for the opinion of mankind, which preserve a fem-
blance of worth, where- the reality is wanting. Secure of im-
punity, some regulars, in contempt of their vow of poverty,
engage openly in commerce; and are so rapaciously eager in
arnafing wealth, that they become the most grievous opprcffors
of the Indians, whom it as their duty to have protccd.
Others, with no less flagrant violation of their vow of chalitv,
indulge with little disguise in the most dissolute licentiounce.s 1

VARIOUS schemes have been proposed for redressing cnormi-

arts. They alarmed the superstitious, by representing the pro- B K
ceedings of the viceroy as innovations fatal to religion. They -_.
employed all the refinements of intrigue, in order to gain per-
sons in power; and seconded by the powerful influence of the
Jcfuits, who enjoyed all the privileges which belonged to the
M1indicant orders in America; they made a deep imprcfiion on a
bigotted prince, and a weak ministry. The ancient practice
was tolerated. The abuses which it occasioned continued to
increase, and the corruption of monks, exempt fiom tle re-
firaints of discipline, and the infrpction of any ifupcrior,
became a difgracc to religion. At lafl, as the veneration
of the Spaniards for the monastic orders began to abate, and
the power of the Jcfuits was on tle dccliie, Ferdinand VI.
ventured to apply the only cflFclual rcmcdy, by iiling an Jic 2Je3L
edit, prohibiting Regulars of every denomination fiom taking '?Z
the charge of any pariih with the cure of iouls; and declaring,
that on the demile of the present incumbenlts, none but fcculIar

presented to vacant benefices . If this regulation is carried into
excecution with fleadinefs, in any degree proportional to the
wifdol with which it is framed, a very considerable reforma-

and tlhe secular clergy may gradually become a refccdlable body

B 0 K Bur whatever merit the Spanifll ecclesiastics in America may
'---, --'poiTefs, the success of their endeavours in communicating the
greilPcoon- knowledge of true religion to the Indians, has been more im-
vetina the perfect than might have been expeced, either from the dgree
Chrillianity. of their zeal, or from the dominion which they had acquiiced

over that people. For this various reasons may be afligncd.
The first miflionaries, in their ardour to make proselytes, ad-
mitted the people of America into the christian church, with.-
out previous inftrudion in the doctrines of religion, and even
before they themselves had acquired such knowledge of tl:cir
language, as to be able to explain to them the myfleries of
faith, or the precepts of duty. Refling upon a subtle diflinc-
flon in fcholaflic theology, they adopted this strange pralice,
no lels inconfifient with the spirit of a religion, which addreffcs
itself to the understanding of men, than repugnant to the dic-
tates of reason. As oon as any body of people, overawed by
dread of the Spanish power, moved by the example of their
own chiefs, incited by levity, or yielding from mere ignor!nce,
expressed the slightest desire of embracing the religion of thei
conquerors, they were inflantly baptized. While this ra'e of
conversion continued, a tingle clergyman baptized in one day
above five thousand Mexicans, and did not desist until he was
so exhaufled by fatigue, that he was unable to lift his handls'.
In the course of a few years, after the reduction of the Mexican
empire, the facramcnt of baptifin was adminiflered to more
than four millions b. Proselytes adopted with such inconsiderate
hafle, and who were neither iniruccdl in the nature of tlc
tenets, to which it was supposed they had given affcnt, nor

taught the absurdity of those which they were required to re- B 0 K
linquifh, retained their veneration for their ancient fuperfli- ---- e
tions in full force, or mingled an attachment to its dodrines
and rites, with that slender knowledge of Chriflianity which
they acquired. These sentiments they tranfinitted to their pof-
terity, into whose minds they have funk so deep, that the Spa-
nifh ecclesiastics, with all their industry, have not been able to
eradicate them. The religious institutions of their ancestors
are fill remembered, and held in honour by the Indians, both
in Mexico and Peru; and whenever they think themselves out
of reach ofinfpedion by the Spaniards, they anfcmble and cele-
brate their idolatrous rites '.

BuT this is not the most unsurmountable obstacle to the pro-

grefs of Christianity among the Indians. The powers of their
uncultivated understandings are so limited, their observations
and refledions reach so little beyond the mere objects of sense,
that they seem hardly to have the capacity of forming abftra&
ideas, and possess not language to express them. To such men,
the sublime and spiritual doctrines of Christianity muff be in-
comprehensible. The numerous and splendid ceremonies of
popish worship, as they catch the eye, please and interest them;
but when their infirudors attempt to explain the articles of
faith, with which those external obfervanccs are connced,
though they liften with patience, they so little conceive tle
meaning of what they hear, that their acquicfcence does not
merit the name of belief. Their indifference is ill greater
than their incapacity. Attentive only to the prcfent moment,
and ingroffed by the objects before them, the Indians lb seldom

impreflion upon them; and while their foresight rarely ex-
tends so far as the next day, it is almost impossible to inspire
them with solicitude about the concerns of a future world.
Astonished equally at their slowness of comprehension, and at
their insensibility, some of the early missionaries pronounced
them a race of men so brutiflh, as to be incapable of understand-
ing the first principles of religion. A council held at Lima
decreed, that, on account of this incapacity, they ought
to be excluded from the sacrament of the Eucharist"' And
though Paul III. by his famous bull, issued in the year I537,
declared them to be rational creatures, entitled to all the privi-
leges of christians e; yet, after the lapse of two centuries, dur-
ing which they have been members of the church, so imperfect
are their attainments in knowledge, that very few possess such
a portion of spiritual discernment, as to be deemed worthy of
being admitted to the holy communion'. From this idea of
their incapacity and imperfed knowledge of religion, when the
zeal of Philip II. established the inquisition in America in the
year 1570, the Indians were exempted from the jurifdition of
that severe tribunal , and still continue under the infpedion of
their diocesans. Even after the mofl perfec inftrudcion, thcir
faith is held to be feeble and dubious; and though some of them
have been taught the learned languages, and have gone through
the ordinary course of academic education with applaufc, their
frailty is fiill so much fufpeed, that no Indian is cither or-
dained a priest, or received into any religious order .

FROM this brief survey, ome idea may be formed of the in- B o o K
terior rfate of the Spanish colonies. The various produtions

Prnduaion:;

with which they supply and enrich the mother-country, and of tle Spatli1t
the fyflem of commercial intercourse between them, come next colonies.
in order to be explained. If the dominions of Spain in the
New World had been of such moderate extent, as bore any pro-
portion to the parent state, the progress of her colonizing might
have been attended with the fame benefit as that of other na-
tions. But when, in less than half a century, her inconsiderate
rapacity had seized on countries larger than all Europe, her in-
ability to fill such vast regions, with a number of inhabitants
sufficient for the cultivation of them, was so obvious, as to give
a wrong direction to all the efforts of the colonifis. They did
not form compat settlements, where induflry, circumscribed
within limits, both in its views and operations, is conducted
with that fober persevering spirit, which gradually converts
whatever is in its poffeflion to its proper use, and derives from
it the greatest advantage. Instead of this, the Spaniards, fe-
duced by the boundless profped which opened to them, divid-
ed their poffeflions in America into governments of vail extent.
As their number was too small to attempt the regular culture of
the immense provinces, which they occupied rather than
peopled, they bent their attention to a few ol)jcts, that allured
them with hopes of sudden and exorbitant gain, and turned
away with contempt from the humbler paths of indulry, which
lead more slowly, but with greater certainty, to wealth and in-
crease of national strength.

OF all the methods by which riches may be acquired, that of Fl:m tlhir

searching for the precious metals is one of the most inviting to
men, who are either unaccutlomed to the regular afliduity with

,., must be carried on, or so enterprising and rapacious, as not to be

satisfied with the gradual returns of profit which they yield.
Accordingly, as soon as the several countries in America were
fubjeded to the dominion of Spain, this was almost the only
method of acquiring wealth which occurred to the adventurers,
by whom they were conquered. Such provinces of the con-
tinent as did not allure them to fettle, by the profpeat of their
affording gold and silver, were totally negleded. Those in
which they met with a disappointment of the sanguine expecta-
tions they had formed, were abandoned. Even the value of
the islands, the first fruits of their discoveries, and the first ob-
jed of their attention, funk so much in their estimation, when
the mines which they had opened there were exhausted, that
they were deserted by many of the planters, and left to be oc-
cupied by more industrious possessors. All crowded to Mexico
and Peru, where the vast quantities of gold and silver found
among the natives, who searched for them with little indufiry,
and less skill, promised an unexhaufted flore, as the recompence
of more intelligent and persevering efforts.

cotecas. mines of Potofi, in Peru, were accidentally discovered in the

year 1545 , by an Indian, as he was clambering up the moun-
tain, in pursuit of a Llama which had strayed from his flock.
Soon after the mines of Sacotecas, in New Spain, little inferior
to the other in value, were opened. From that time, fucccfivc di:-
coverics have been made in both colonies, and silver mines are now

so numerous, that the working of them, and of some few mines B O O K
of gold in the provinces of Tierra Firma, and the new kingdom Vfi
of Granada, has become the capital occupation of the Spani-
ards, and is reduced into a system no less complicated than in-
teresting. To describe the nature of the various ores, the mode
of extracting them from the bowels of the earth, and to explain
the several procefies by which the metals are separated from the
substances with which they are mingled, either by the action of
fire, or the attracive powers of mercury, is the province of
the natural philosopher or chymift, rather than of the his-
torian.

THE exuberant profusion with which the mountains of the Ricleswhich

New World poured forth their treasures, aftoniled mankind, they yield.
accustomed hitherto to receive a penurious supply of the preci-
ous metals, from the more scanty stores contained in the mines
of the ancient hemisphere. According to principles of compu-
tation, which appear to be extremely moderate, the quantity of
gold and silver that has been regularly entered in the ports of
Spain, is equal in value to four millions sterling annually,
reckoning from the year 1492, in which America was disco-
vered to the present time. This in two hundred and eighty-three
years, amounts to eleven hundred and thirty-two millions.
Immense as this fum is, the Spanilh writers contend, that as
much more ought to be added to it, in consideration of the trea-
sure which has been extraced from the mines, without paying
duty to the king. By this account, Spain has drawn from the
New World a supply of wealth, amounting at least to two thou-
sand millions of pounds fierling k.

Spirit to

gives rife. person who discovers a new vein, is entitled to the property of

it. Upon laying his claim before the governor of the province,
a certain extent of land is measured off, and a certain number
of Indians allotted him, under the obligation of his opening
the mine within a limited time, and of his paying the cufto-
mary duty to the king, for what it shall produce. Invited by
the facility with which such grants are obtained, and encou-
raged by some firiking examples of success in this line of ad-
venture; not only the sanguine and the bold, but the timid
and diffident enter upon it with astonishing ardour. With vafl
objets always in view, fed continually with hope, and ex-
pecting every moment that fortune will unveil her secret flores,
and give them up to their withes, they deem every other occu-
pation insipid and uninteresting. -The charms of this pursuit,
like the rage for deep play, is so bewitching, and take such full
possession of the mind, as even to give a new bent to the na-
tural temper. Under its influence, the cautious become enter-
prizing, and the covetous profuse. Powerful as this charm
naturally is, its force is augmented by the arts of an order of
men known in Peru, by the cant name of Jearchers. These
are commonly persons of desperate fortunes, who, availing
themselves of ome skill in mineralogy, accompanied with the
insinuating manner, and confident pretensions peculiar to pro-
jecors, address the wealthy and the credulous. By plausible
descriptions of the appearances which they have discovered of
rich veins hitherto unexplored; by producing when requisite,
specimens of promising ore; by affirming, with an imposing
assurance, that success is certain, and that the expence mull be

trifling; they seldom fail to persuade. An association is B K
formed; a finall um is advanced by each co partner; the
mine is opened; the searcher is entrusted with the sole direc-
tion of every operation; unforeseen difficulties occur; new
demands of money are made; but amidfl a fucceflion of dif-
appointments and delays, hope is never extinguished, and the
ardour of expectation hardly abates. For it is obfcrved, that
if any person once enter this seducing path, it is almost impof-
fible to return; his ideas alter, he seems to be pofleffcd with
another spirit, visions of imaginary wealth are continually be-
fore his eyes, and he thinks, and speaks, and dreams of nothing
else'.

Such is the spirit that muff be formed, wherever the ative Fntal effeia

exertions of any society are chiefly employed in working mines of it
of gold and silver. No spirit is more adverse to such improve-
ment in agriculture and commerce, as render a nation real-
ly opulent. If the system of administration in the Spanish co-
lonies had been founded upon principles of found policy, the
power and ingenuity of the legislature would have been exerted
with as much ardour, in restraining its subje&s from fuich perni-
cious industry, as is now employed in alluring them towards it.

< its own accord. Such, in reality, is the absurd confidence
"which all men have in their own good fortune, that wherever
" there is the least probability of success, too great a share of it

is apt to go to them of its own accord m." But in the Spanifl

colonies, government is fludious to cherish a spirit which it
should have laboured to depress, and by the fantion of its ap-
probation augments that inconsiderate credulity, which has
turned the acive industry of Mexico and Peru into
such an improper channel. To this may be imputed the slender
progress which they have made during two centuries and
a half, either in useful manufa&ures, or in those lucrative
brinches of cultivation, which furnish the colonies of other
nations with their staple commodities. In comparison with the
precious metals, every bounty of nature is so much despised,
that this extravagant idea of their value has mingled with the
idiom of the language in America, and the Spaniards fettled
there denominate a country, rich, not from the fertility of its
foil, the abundance of its crops, or the exuberance of its pas-
tures, but on account of the minerals which its mountains con-
tain. In quest of theie, they abandon the delightful plains
of Peru and Mexico, and retort to barren and uncomfortable
regions, where they have built ome of the largest towns which
they possess in the New World. As the activity and enterprise
of the Spaniards originally took this direaion, it is now so
difficult to bend them a different way, that although, from
various causes, the gain of working mines is much decreased;
the fascination continues, and almot every person, who takes
any aive part in the commerce of New Spain or Peru, is fiill
engaged in some adventure of this kind ".

most salutary simple, perhaps, and of mos restorative virtue, that
Providence, in coinpafilon for human infirmity, has made known
unto man, is found only in Peru, to which it affords a lucra-
tive branch of commerce ". The indigo of Guatimala is iupe-
rior in quality to that of any province in America, and culti-
vated to a considerable extent. Cacoa, though not peculiar to
the Spaniih colonies, attains to its highest slate of perfecion
there, and from the great consumption of chocolate in Europe,

ditywhich almost exceeds belief. A few years after the Spaniards
fettled there, the herds of tame cattle became so numerous, that
their proprietors reckoned them by thousands °. Less attention
being paid to them, as they continued to increase, they were
suffered to run wild, and spreading over a country of boundless
extent, under a mild climate, and covered with rich pasture,
their number became immense. They range over the vast
plains which extend from Buenos Ayres, towards the Andes,
in herds of thirty or forty thousand; and the unlucky tra-
veller who once falls in among them, may proceed several days
before he can disentangle himself from among the crowd that
covers the face of the earth, and seems to have no end. They
are hardly less numerous in New Spain, and in several other
provinces: these are killed merely for the fake of their hides;
and the slaughter at certain seasons is so great, that the flench
of the carcases, which are left in the field, would affeat the
air, if large packs of wild dogs, and vast flocks of gallinazos,
or American vultures, the most voracious of all the feathered
kind, did not inflantly devour them. The number of those
hides exported in every fleet to Europe is prodigious, and is a
lucrative branch of commerce .

Almost all those articles may be qonfidered as staple commo-

dities peculiar to America, and different, if we except that last
mentioned, from the produtions of the mother-country.

terior industry and manufacures were in a ate so prosperous, B I K
that with the product of these, fle was able both to purchase ----
the commodities of the New World, and to answer its growing
demands. Under the reigns of Ferdinand and Isabella, and
Charles V. Spain was one of the most industrious countries
in Europe. Her manufactures in wool, and flax, and silk, were
so extensive, as not only to furnish what was sufficient for her
own consumption, but to afford a surplus for exportation.
When a market for them, formerly unknown, and to which
the alone had access, opened in America, he had recourse to
her domestic flore, and found there an abundant fupplyq.
This new employment muff naturally have added vivacity to
the spirit of industry. Nourished and invigorated by it, the
manufacures, the population, and wealth of Spain might
have gone on increasing in the fame proportion with her colo-
nies. Nor was the state of the Spanish marine at this period
lets flourishing than that of its manufactures. In the beginning
of the sixteenth century, Spain is said to have possessed above a
thousand merchant hips r, a number probably far superior to
that of any nation in Europe. By the aid which foreign trade
and domestic industry give reciprocally to each other in their
progress, the augmentation of both muff have been rapid and
extensive, and Spain might have received the fame acceflion of
opulence and vigour from her acquisitions in the New World,
that other powers have derived from their colonies there.

Bur various causes prevented this. It is with nations as with why nlcoes

individuals, when wealth flows in gradually, and with mo- riv'tmlcea
derate increase, it feeds and nourilles that adivity which is

conduced exertions; but when it pours in suddenly, and
with too full a fiream, it overturns all fober plans of industry,
and brings along with it a taste for what is wild, and extrava-
gant, and daring in business or in'aEtion. Such was the great
and sudden augmentation of power and revenue, that the poffcf-
sion of America brought into Spain, and some symptoms of
its pernicious influence upon the political operations of that
monarchy oon began to appear. For a considerable time,
however, the supply of treasure from the New World was scanty
and precarious, and the genius of Charles V. conducted public
mtafsures with such prudence, that the effects of this influence
were little perceived. But when Philip II. ascended the Spanifii.
throne, with talents far inferior to those of his father, and re-
mittances from the colonies became a regular and vati branch of
revenue, the fatal operation of this rapid change in the state of
the kingdom, both on the monarch and his people, was at
once conspicuous. Philip, possessing that spirit of unceasing
aTliduity, which often charaCerizes the ambition of men of
moderate talents, entertained fich an high opinion of his own
resources, that he thought nothing: too arduous for him to under-
take. Shut up himself in the solitude of the Escurial, e
troubled and annoyed all the nations around him. He waged
open-war with the Dutch and English; he encouraged and aid-
ed a rebellious faCtion in France; lie conquered Portugal, and
maintained armies and garrisons in Italy, Afi-ica, and both the
Indies. By such a multiplicity of great and complicated operi-
tions, pursucd with ardour during the course of a long rcigr,
Spain was drained both of men and money. Under the wc;ik
administration of his fcccffor, Philip III. the vigour of the na-
tion continued to deccreafc, and funk into the lowell decline,

wvh1cn

when the inconsiderate bigotry of that monarch expelled at once B O K
near a million of his most industrious fubjecds, at the very time l -..
when the exhausted tfate of the kingdom required some extraor- A. D. iG .
dinary exertion of political wisdom to augment its numbers, and
to revive its strength. Early in the seventeenth century, Spain
felt such a diminution in the number of her people, that from
inability to recruit her armies, 1he was obliged to contraE her
operations. Her flourifning manufaaurcs were fallcn into de-
cay. Her fleets, which had been the terror of all Europe, were
ruined. Her extensive foreign commerce was loft. The trade
between different parts of her own dominions was interrupted,
and the ships which attempted to carry it on, were taken and
plundered by enemies, whom they once despised. Even agri-
culture, the primary objcct of industry in every prosperous
state, was negle&ced, and one of the molf fertile countries in
Europe hardly raised what was sufficient for the support of its
own inhabitants.

IN proportion as the population and manufacturcs of the Rapid rcc!i.e

parent fate declined, the demands of her colonies continued to of its tra;llc
increase. The Spaniards, like their monarchs, intoxicated with
the wealth which poured in annually upon them, defrtced the
paths of indufiry, to which they had been accuflomed, and re-

(as I have observed in another place) their clothing, their fur-
niture, whatever ministers to the ease or luxury of life, and
even their instruments of labour from Europe. Spain, thinned
of people, and void of industry, was unable to supply their in-
creasing demands. She had recourse to her neighbours. The
manufactures of the Low Countries, of England, of France,
and of Italy, which her wants called into existence, or animated
with new vivacity, furnished in abundance whatever he re-
quired. In vain did the fundamental law, concerning the ex-
clufion of foreigners from trade with America, oppose this in-
novation. Necessity, more powerful than any flatute, defeat-
ed its operations, and constrained the Spaniards themselves to
concur in eluding it. The English, the French, and Dutch,
relying on the fidelity and honour of Spanish merchants, who
lend their names to cover the deceit, fend out their manufactures
to America, and receive the exorbitant price for which they are
fold there, either in specie, or in the rich commodities of the
New World. Neither the dread of danger, nor the allure-
ment of profit, ever induced a Spanish factor to betray or de-
fraud the person who confided in him'; and that probity,
which is the pride and diftindion of the nation, contributes to
its ruin. In a short time, not above a twentieth part of the
commodities exported to America was of Spanish growth or fa-
bric'. All the reft was the property of foreign merchants,
though entered in the name of Spaniards. The treasure of the
New World may be said henceforward not to have belonged
to Spain. Before it reached Europe, it was anticipated as the

price of goods purchased from foreigners. That wealth, B O0 K
which, by an internal circulation, would have spread through -
each vein of industry, and have conveyed life and ativity to
every branch of manufacure, flowed out of the kingdom with
such a rapid course, as neither enriched nor animated it. On
the other hand, the artisans of rival nations, encouraged by
this quick sale of their commodities, improved so much in skill
and industry, as to be able to afford them at a rate so low, that
the manufactures of Spain, which could not vie with theirs,
either in quality or cheapness of work, were still farther de-
pressed. This deftruaive commerce drained off the riches of
the nation faster and more completely, than even the extrava-
gant schemes of ambition carried on by its monarchs. Spain
was so much astonished and distressed, at beholding her Ame-
rican treasures vanish almost as soon as they were imported,
that Philip III. unable to supply what was requisite in circulation,
issued an ediQ, by which he endeavoured to raise copper
money, to a value in currency nearly equal to that of silver °;
and the lord of the Peruvian and Mexican mines was reduced
to a wretched expedient, which is the last resource of petty impo-
veriibed states.

THvUS the poffefions of Spain in America have not proved

a source of population and of wealth to her, in the fame man-
ner as those of other nations. In the countries of Europe,
where the spirit of industry ubfiflts in full vigour, every person

those of Spain, is supposed to give employment to three or four

.tion between their demands, and her capacity of anfveriing
them, have been much increased by the mode in which Spain
has endeavoured to regulate the intercourse between the mo-
ther-country and the colonies. It is from her idea of monopo-
lizing the trade with America, and debarring her fubjeas there
from any communication with foreigners, that all her jealous
and systematic arrangements have arisen. These are so singular
in their nature and consequences, as to merit a particular ex-
planation. In order to secure the monopoly at which fle aim-
ed, Spain did not vest the trade with her colonies in an exclu-
five company, a plan which has been adopted by nations more
commercial, and at a period when mercantile policy was an ob-
ject of greater attention, and ought to have been better under-
flood. The Dutch gave up the whole trade with their colonies,
both in the East and Well Indies, to exclusive companies. The
English, the French, the Danes, have imitated their example
with refpectd to the East Indian commerce ; and the two formcr
have laid a similar refiraint upon some branches of their tir'dl
with the New World. The wit of man cannot, perhaps, dc-
vise a method for checking the progrcfs of iiuliflry and popula-
tion in a new colony more effecual than this. Th'e intcrcll of

of their surplus flock discouraged by those very persons to whomr
alone they are permitted to dispose of it .

SPAIN, it is probable, was preserved from falling into this Thisconfin-

ed to one

error in policy, by the high ideas which he early formed con- port in Spain.
cerning the riches of the New World. Gold and silver were
commodities of too high value to vet a monopoly of them in
private hands. The crown wished to retain the direction of a
commerce so inviting; and in order to secure that, ordained that
the cargo of every hip fitted out for America, should be infpeCEed
by the officers of the Casa de Contratacion in Seville, before it
could receive a licence to make the voyage; and that on its re-
turn, a report of the commodities which it brought hould be
made to the fame board, before it could be permitted to land
them. In consequence of this regulation, all the trade of Spain
with the New World centred in the port of Seville, and was
gradually brought into a form, in which it has been conduted,
with little variation, from the middle of the sixteenth century
almost to our own times. For the greater security of the valu-
able cargoes ent to America, as well as for the more cafy pre-
vention of fraud, the commerce of Spain with its colonies is
carried on by fleets, which fail under firong convoys. Thcfe
fleets consisting of two squadrons, one distinguished by the name
ofGaleons, the other by that of the Flo/a, are equipped annually.
Formerly they took their departure from Seville; but as the
port of Cadiz has been found more commodious, they have fail-
ed fiom it since the year 1720.

Being confined to a single port, it was of course thrown into a
few hands, and almost the whole of it was gradually engrossed
by a small number of wealthy houes, formerly in Seville, and
now in Cadiz. These by combinations, which they can easily
form, may altogether prevent that competition which prefervcs
commodities at their natural price; and by acting in concert, to
which they are prompted by their mutual interest, they may
raise or lower their value at pleasure. In consequence of this,
the price of European goods in America is always high, and
often exorbitant. A hundred, two hundred, and even three
hundred per cent. are profits not uncommon in the commerce of
Spain with her colonies a. From the fame ingrowing spirit it
frequently happens, that traders of the second order, whose
warehoufcs do not contain a complete aflortment of commodi-
ties for the American market, cannot purchase from the more
opulent merchants, such goods as they want, at a lower price than
that for which they are fold in the colonies. With the fame

a--,_..
, sone port, not only affects its domeflic fate, but limits its foreign

operations. A monopolist may acquire more, and certainly will
hazard less, by a confined trade which yields exorbitant profit,
than by an extensive commerce in which he receives only a
moderate return of gain. It is often his interest not to enlarge,
but to circumscribe the sphere of his activity; and inflead of
calling forth more vigorous exertions of commercial industry,
it may be the objeC of his attention to check and set bounds to
them. By some such maxim, the mercantile policy of Spain
seems to have regulated its intercourse with America. Instead
offurnifhing the colonies with European goods in such quantity
as might render both the price and the profit moderate; the
merchants of Seville and Cadiz seem to have supplied them with
a sparing hand, that the eagerness of competition amongst
customers obliged to purchase in a scanty marker, might enable
their factors to dispose of their cargoes with exorbitant gain.
About the middle of the last century, when the exclusive trade
to America from Seville was in its most flourishing state, the
burden of the two united squadrons of the Galeons and Flota,
did not exceed twenty-feven thousand five hundred tons'. The
supply which such a fleet could carry muff have been very in-
adequate to the demands of those populous and extensive co-
lonies, which depended upon it for all the luxuries, and many
of the necessaries of life.

ployed their thoughts in devising methods for reviving the de- B K
caying industry and commerce of their country. From the - --
violence of the remedies proposed, we may judge how desperate
and fatal the malady appeared. Some, confounding a violation
of police with criminality against the slate, contended, that in
order to check illicit commerce, every person conviced of carry-
ing it on, should be punihed with death, and confiscation of
all his effects d. Others, forgetting the diftinEtion between civil
offences and as of impiety, insisted, that contraband trade
hould be ranked among the crimes reserved for the cognizance
of the Inquisition; that such as were guilty of it might be tried
and punished, according to the secret and summary form in
which that dreadful tribunal exercises itsjurifdiCtion . ()thers,
uninftruCted by observing the pernicious effeCts of monopolies
in every country where they have been eflablifhed, have pro-
posed to vest the trade with America in exclusive companies,
whom interest would render the most vigilant guardians of the
Spanish commerce against the encroachments of interlopers'.

feeble monarchs, with whom the reign of the Auilrian line in
Spain closed, incapacity and indecision are conspicuous in every
department of government. Inflead of taking for their model the
active adminifiration of Charles V. they affeded to imitate the
cautious procraflinating wisdom of Philip II. and deflitute of
his talents, they deliberated perpetually, but determined no-

t..,- _j These evils continued to increase, and Spain, with dominions

more extensive and more opulent than any European slate,
polfeffed neither vigour, nor money h, nor industry. At length,
the violence of a great national convulsion rouzed the slumber-
ing genius of Spain, and the efforts of the two contending par-
ties in the civil war, kindled by the dispute concerning the fuc-
cession of the crown at the beginning of this century, called forth,
in some degree, the ancient fpirir and vigour of the nation. While
men were forming, capable of adopting more liberal sentiments,
than those which had influenced the councils of the monarchy du-
ring the course of a century, Spain derived from an unexpected
source the means of availing itself of their talents. The vari-
ous powers who favoured the pretensions either of the Austrian
or Bourbon candidate for the Spanifli throne, ent formidable
fleets and armies to their support. France, England, and Hol-
land remitted immense fums to Spain. These were spent in
the provinces which became the theatre of war. Part of the
American treasure, of which they had drained the kingdom,
flowed back thither. From thio aera, one of the nofl intelli-
gent Spanish authors, dates the revival of the monarchy; and,
however humiliating the truth may be, he acknowledges, that
it is to her enemies his country is indebted for the acquiition
of a fund of circulating specie, in some measure adequate to the
exigencies of the public'.

able for superiority of genius, they have all been beneficent v_--
princes, attentive to the happiness of their fubjcds, and folici-
tous promote it. It was, accordingly, the first object of Philip V.
to suppress an innovation which had crept in during the course of
the war, and over turned the whole fyflem of the Spanilh commerce by excluding

foreigners

with America. The English and Dutch, by their superiority in na- from rade
val power, having acquired such command of the ea, as to cut off withPeru;
all intercourse between Spain and her colonies, Spain, in order to
furnish them thole necessaries of life, without which they could
not exilt, and as the only means of receiving from thence any
part of their treasure, departed so far from the usual ri-
gour of its maxims, as to open the trade with Peru to her allies
the French. The merchants of St. Malo, to whom Louis XIV.
granted the privilege of this lucrative commerce, engaged in it
with vigour, and carried it on upon principles very different
from those of the Spaniards. They supplied Peru with European
commodities at a more moderate price, and not in flinted quanti-
ty; the goods which they imported were conveyed to every
province of Spanish America, in such abundance as had never
been known in any former period. If this intercourse had been
continued, the exportation of European commodities friom
Spain must have ceased, and the dependence of the colonies on
the mother-country have been at an end. The moLt pcrcmp- ,1713.
tory injunctions were therefore iflued, prohibiting the admif-
sion of foreign vessels into any port of Peru or Chili k, and a Spa-
infn fuadron was employed to clear the South Sea of intruders,

B 0 0 K BUT though, on the cessation of the war, which was ter-

VIII. -.-- minated by the treaty of Utrecht, Spain obtained relief from

contraband one encroachment on her commercial system, she was exposed to
trade, another which she deemed hardly less pernicious. As an in-

ducement that might prevail with Queen Anne to conclude a
peace, which France and Spain desired with equal ardour,

particularly of Philip V. not only conveyed to Great Britain the Alffento, or con-
Aeffntgocor- tra for supplying the Spanish colonies with negroes, which had
pany, formerly.been enjoyed by France, but granted it the more ex-

traordinary privilege of fending annually to the fair of Porto-
bello a ship of five hundred tons, laden with European commo-
dities. In consequence of this,, British facories were eflabliflled
at Carthagena, Panama, Vera Cruz, Buenos Ayres, and other
Spanish settlements. The veil with which Spain had hitherto
covered the state and tranfaaions of her colonies was removed.
The agents of a rival nation, residing in the towns of most ex-
tensive trade, and of chief retort, had the befl opportunities of
becoming acquainted with the interior condition of their pro-
vinces, of observing their stated and occasional wants, and of
knowing what commodities might be imported into them with
the greatest advantage. In consequence of information so au-
thentic and expeditious, the merchants of Jamaica, and other
English colonies who traded to the Spanish main, were enabled
to assort and proportion their cargoes, so exactly to the demands
of the market, that the contraband commerce was carried on
with a facility, and to an extent unknown in any former pe-
riod. This, however, was not the most fatal consequence of
the Afliento to the trade of Spain. The agents of the British
South Sea Company, under cover of the importation which
they were authorised to make by the ship sent annually to Porto-
bello, poured in their commodities on the Spanish continent,

without

without limitation or restraint. Inflead of a flip of five hun- B o oc
dred tons, as flipulated in tile treaty, they usually employed one .---
which exceeded nine hundred tons in burden. She was accom-
panied by two or three smaller vessels, which mooring in oime
neighbouring creek, supplied her clandetfinely with fresh bales
of goods, to replace such as were fold. The infpedors of the
fair, and officers of the revenue, gained by exorbitant prcfcnts,
connived at the fraud '. Thus, partly by the operations of the
company, and partly by the activity of private interlopers, al-
moll the whole trade of Spanifi America was ingroffd by so-
reigners. The immense commerce of the Galeons, forncrly

two thousand tons"', served hardly any purpose but to fetch
home the royal revenue arising from the fifth on filvcr.

WHILE Spain observed those encroachments, and felt so fen- Glarda Cor-

t, s employed

sibly their pernicious effcs, it was ipoffible not to make fr, ethis pur
some effort to restrain theri. Her firfl expedient was to flation p0e
Ihips of force, under the appellation of Guarda Cofans, upon the
coasts of those provinces, to which interlopers molt frequently
retorted. As private interest concurred with the duty which
they owed to the public, in rendering the officers who com-
manded them vigilant and aive, ome check was given to the
progress of the contraband trade, though in dominions so ex-
tensive, and so accessible by lea, no number of cruizcrs was
sufficient to guard against its inroads in every quarter. This
interruption of an intcrcourfe, which had been carried on with
so much facility, that the merchants in the ritifl colonies

unjustifiable ats of violence committed by the captains of the
1739. Spanish Guarda Coflas, precipitated Great Britain into a war

with Spain, by which the latter obtained a final release from
the Affiento, and was left at liberty to regulate the commerce
of her colonies, without being restrained by any engagement
with a foreign power.

The ufeof As the formidable encroachments of the English on their
Tegifter hips
introduced. American trade, had discovered to the Spaniards the vast

consumption of European goods in their colonies, and taught
them the advantage of accommodating their importations to the
occasional demand of the various provinces, they perceived the
necessity of devising some method of supplying their colonies,
different from their ancient one, of fending thither periodical
fleets. This mode of communication was not only uncertain,
as the departure of the Galeons and Flota was sometimes retard-
ed by various accidents, and often prevented by the wars which
raged in Europe, but was ill adapted to afford America a regu-
lar and timely supply of what it wanted. The scarcity of Eu-
ropean goods in the Spanifli settlements frequently became ex-
ceflive; their price rose to an enormous height; the vigilant
eye of mercantile attention did not fail to oferve this favour-
able opportunity, an ample supply was poured in by intcrlo-
pers from the English, the French, and Dutch islands; and
when the Galcons at length arrived, they found the markets so
glutted by this illicit commerce, that there was no demand for
the commodities with which they were loaded. In order to re-
medy this, Spain permitted a considerable part of her commerce

2 wlith

with America, to be carried on by regifeerjjhips. These are B 1 0 Ki
fitted out, during the intervals between the flated seasons when V-
the Galeons and Flota fail, by merchants in Seville or Cadiz, up-
on obtaining a licence from the council of the Indies, for which
they pay a very high premium, and are destined for thofc ports
where any extraordinary demand is foreseen or expected. By
this expedient, such a regular supply of freflh commodities is
conveyed to the American market, that the interloper is no
longer allured by the fame profpe& of excelfive gain, or the
people in the colonies urged by the fame neceflity, to en-
gage in the hazardous adventures of contraband trade.

IN proportion as experience manifeited the advantages of car- Thbe iflcon

rying on trade in this mode, the number of regiftcr flfips in-
creased; and at length, in the year 1748, the Galeons, after hav-
ing been employed upwards of two centuries, were finally abo-
lifhed. From that period there has been no intercourse with
Chili and Peru but by tingle fllips, dispatched from time to time
as occasion requires, and when the merchants expect a market will

formerly observed, muff gradually decline, when deprived of
that commerce to which they owed their existence. This dif-
advantage however is more than compcnfated, for the whole
continent of South America receives supplies of European com-
modities, with so much regularity, and in fiich abundance, as
must contribute greatly to the lhappincfs and profpciity of all the

Schemes for NOR has the attention of Spain been confined to regulating
reviving cornm-
,mrrcv, the trade with its flourishing colonies, it has extended likewise

to the reviving commerce in those settlements where it was ne-
gleded, or had decayed. Among the new taftes which the
people of Europe have acquired, in consequence of their inter-
course with the natives of those countries which they conquered
in America, that for chocolate is one of the molt universal. The
ife of this liquor made with a pase, formed of the nut, or al-
mond of the cacao-tree, compounded with various ingredients, the
Spaniards first learned from the Mexicans; and it has appeared
to them, and to the other European nations, so palatable, so
nourishing, and so wholesome, that it has become a commercial
article of considerable importance. The cacao-tree grows fpon-
taneoufly in several parts of the torrid zone; but the nuts of the
bell quality, next to those of Guatimala, on the South Sea, are pro-
duced in the rich plains of Caraccas, a-province of Tierra Firme.
In consequence of this acknowledged superiority in the quality of
cacao in that province, and its communication with the Atlantic,
which facilitates the conveyance to Europe, theculture of the cacao
there is more extensive than in any difirid of America. But the
Dutch, by the vicinity of their settlements in the small ilands
of Curazoa and Buen-Ayre, to the coast of Caraccas, gradually
ingroffed the greatest partof the cacao trade. The traffic with the

or the defets of their commercial arrangements, that they --
were obliged to receive from the hands of foreigners this pro-
dution of their own colonies, at an exorbitant price. In order
to remedy an evil no less disgraceful, than pernicious to his fuib- by eltblifh

an exclusive right to the commerce with Caraccas and. Cumana,
on condition of their employing, at their own expence, a sufficient
number of armed eftels to clear the coast of interlopers. This
society, distinguished ometimes by the name of the company of
Guipufcoa, from the province of Spain in which it is eflablifled,
and sometimes by that of the Company of Caraccas, from the
difirid of America to which it trades, has carried on its opera-
tions with flich vigour and ifccefs, that Spain has recovered an
important branch of commerce, which fie had fitffercd to be
wrested from her, and is plentifully supplied with an article of
extensive consumption at a moderate price. Not only the pa-
rent fiate, but the colony of Caraccas, has derived great ad-
vantages from this institution; for although, at the first apect,
it may appear to be one of those monopolies, whose tendency
is to check the spirit of industry, instead of calling it forth to
new exertions, it has been prevented from operating in this man-
ner, by several salutary regulations, framed upon foresight of
such bad erfects, and ofpurpofe to obviate them. The plant-
ers in the Caraccas are not left to depend entirely on the com-
pany, either for the importation of European commodities, or
the sale of their own productions. The inhabitants of the Ca-
nary Islands have the privilege of fending thither annually a
regifler flhip of considerable burden; and fomn Vera Ciuz in
New Spain, a free trade is permitted in every port compre-
hended in the charter of the company. In conc(lqucnce of this,

at its natural and equitable rate. The company has not the power
of raising the former, or degrading the latter at pleasure; and
accordingly, since it was established, the increase of culture, of
population, and of live flock, in the province of Caraccas has
been very considerable 0.

Enlargement BUT as it is slowly that nations relinquish any fyflem which
ideas in Spain. time has rendered venerable, or that commerce can be diverted

from the channel in which it has long been accutfomed to flow;
Philip V. in his new regulations concerning the American
trade, paid such deference to the ancient maxim of Spain, con-
cerning the limitation of all importation from the New World
to one harbour, as to oblige both the register hips which return-
ed from Peru, and those of the Guipofcoan Company from Ca-

of the present age to have turned from frivolous or abstruse
speculations, to the business and affairs of men, has extended
its influence beyond the Pirenees. In the researches of in-
genious authors, concerning the police or commerce of na-

ftrutive tendency of those narrow maxims, which, by cramp- B o K

l

ing commerce in all its operations, have so long retarded its '
progress. It is to the monarch now on the throne, that Spain is
indebted for the first public regulacion formed in consequence of
those ideas.

WHILE Spain adhered with rigour to her ancient maxims Eilablillclnnt

concerning her commerce with America, he was so much afiraid packet boats.
of opening any channel, by which an illicit trade might find
admiflion into the colonies, that she almost shut herfelfout from
any intercourse with them, but that which was carried on by
her annual fleets. There was no etablifllment for a regular
communication of either public or private intelligence, between
the mother-country and its American settlements. From the
want bs this necessary institution, the operations of the slate,
and the business of individuals, were retarded or conducted un-
Ikilfully, and Spain often received from foreigners her first in-
formation with refped to very interesting events in her own co-
lonics. But though this defect in police was sensibly felt, and
the remedy for it was obvious, that jealous spirit with which
the Spanish monarchs guarded the exclusive trade, reltrained
them fron applying it. At length Charles III. surmounted
those confidccrations which ad deterred his predeccffors, and in
the year I7G4, appointed packet-boats to be dispatched on the
first day of each month, from Corugna to the Havanna or Porto-
Rico. From thence letters are conveyed in finaller vcffcls to
Vera Cruz and Porto-bello, and tranlinitted by pof through
the kingdoms of Tierra Firmn, Cranada, Peru, and New Spain.

L - of Spain, from which equal advantages must redound to the

political and mercantile interest of the kingdom . With this
new arrangement, a scheme of extending commerce has been
more immediately conneced. Each of the packet-boats, which
are vessels of some considerable burden, is allowed to take in
half a loading of such commodities as are the product of Spain,
and most in demand in the ports whither they are bound. In
return for there they may bring home to Corugna an equal quan-
tity of American producions . This may be confidered as the
first relaxations of those rigid laws, which confined the trade
with the New World to a single port, and the first attempt to
admit the reft of the kingdom to ome hare in it.

Free trade IT was soon followed by one more decisive. In the year
permitted to X765, Charles III. laid open the trade to the windward ifands,
several pro-
vinces. Cuba, Hispaniola, Porto Rico, Margarita, and Trinidad, to his

fubjeds in every province of Spain. He permitted them to fail
from certain ports in each of these, specified in the ediE, at
any season, and with whatever cargo they deemed most proper,
without any other warrant than a simple clearance from the
custom-house of the place whence they took their departure.
He released them from the numerous and oppressive duties im-
posed on goods exported to America, and in place of the whole
substituted a moderate tax of fix in the hundred on the com-
modities sent from Spain. He allowed them to return either
to the fame port, or to any other where they might hope for a
more advantageous market, and there to enter the homeward
cargoe, on payment of the usual duties. This ample privilege

to throw round its commercial intercourse with the New World,
was soon after extended to Louisiana, and to the provinces of
Yucatan and Campeachyr.

THE propriety of this innovation, which may be confidered Beneficial es

as the most liberal effort of Spanish legislation, has appeared t
from its effects. Prior to the edic in favour of the free trade,
Spain derived hardly any benefit from its neglected colonies in
H-ispaniola, Porto-Rico, Margareta, and Trinidad. Its com-
merce with Cuba was inconsiderable, and that of Yucatan and
Campeachy was ingroffed almost entirely by interlopers. But
as soon as a general liberty of trade was permitted, the inter-
course with those provinces revived, and has gone on with a
rapidity of progreflion, of which there are few examples in the
hifory of nations. In less than ten years, the trade of Cuba
has been more than tripled. Even in those settlements where,
from the languishing slate of indufiry, greater efforts were
requisite to reflore its aivity, their commerce has been
doubled. It is computed, that such a number of hips is
already employed in the free trade; that the tonnage of them
far exceeds that of the Galeons and Flota, at the mot flourifll-
ing ara of their commerce. The benefits of this arrangement
are not confined to a few merchants, efiablifhed in a favourite
port. They are diffused through every province of the king-
dom; and by opening a new market for their various produc-
tions and manufadcures, must encourage and add vivacity to the
induflry of the farmer and artificer. Nor does the kingdom

-, from what it receives in return, and has the profpea of being

soon able to supply itself with several commodities of ex-
tensive consumption, for which it formerly depended on so-
reigners. The consumption of sugar in Spain is perhaps as
great in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, as that of
any European kingdom. But though possessed of countries in the
New World, whose foil and climate are most proper for rearing
that valuable plant, though the domefiic culture of the sugar-
cane in the kingdom of Granada was once considerable, such
has been the fatal tendency of its institutions in America,
and such the pressure of injudicious taxes in Europe, that
Spain has loft almost entirely this branch of industry, which
has enriched other nations. This commodity, which has now
become an article of primary necessity in Europe, the Spaniards
were obliged to purchase of foreigners, and had the mortifica-
tion to fee their country drained annually of an immense fum
on that account'. But if that spirit, which' the permiflion of
free trade has put in motion, hall persevere in its efforts with
the fame vigour, the cultivation of sugar in Cuba and Porto
Rico, may increase so much, that in a few years their growth
may be equal to the demand of the kingdom.

Free trade HER experience of the beneficial consequences resulting from
pwrenttehe c- having relaxed somewhat of the rigour of her ancient laws

colonies, has induced Spain to permit a more liberal intercourse
of one colony with another. By one of the jealous maxims of
the old fyfiem, all communication between the various pro-

producions, the reciprocal exchange of which might have add-
ed to the happiness of their refpedive inhabitants, or have faci-
litated their progress in industry, so solicitous was the Council
of the Indies, to prevent their receiving any supply of their
wants, but by the periodical fleets from Europe; that in order
to guard against this,. it cruelly debarred the Spaniards in Peru,
in New Spain, in Guatimala, and the New Kingdom of Gra-
nada, from such a correspondence with their fellow-fubjeEts, as
tended manifestly to their mutual prosperity. Of all the nu-
merous reftritions devised by Spain for securing the exclusive
trade with her American settlements, none perhaps was more
illiberal, none seems to have been more sensibly felt, or to have
produced more hurtful effecs. This grievance coeval with the
settlements of Spain in the New World, is at last redressed. In
the year I774, Charles III. published an edic, granting to the
four vast provinces which I havementioned, the privilege of
a free trade with each other '. What may be the effeas of
opening this communication between countries deffined by
their situation for reciprocal intercourse, cannot yet be deter-
mined by experience. They can hardly fail of being beneficial
and extensive. The motives for granting this permission are
manifefily no less laudable, than the principle on which it is
founded is liberal; and both discover the progress of a spirit in
Spain, far elevated above the narrow prejudices and maxims on
which their system for regulating the trade, and conduaing the
government of their colonies, was originally founded.

After being employed seven years in the New World on an ex-
traordinary miflion, and with very extensive powers, as infpec-

provinces of Cinaloa, Sonora, and California, and making fe-
veral important alterations in the itate of their police and re-

nity of the flation. As a remedy for both, he obtained a royal
edia, establishing an additional number of judges in each court
of Audience, with higher titles, and more ample appointments '.

minions in the New World, that several places subjeC to the --
jurifdiaion of each of the viceroys, were at such an enormous
diflance from the capitals in which they. resided, that neither
their attention, nor their authority, could reach them. Some
provinces subordinate to the viceroy of New Spain, lay above
two thousand miles from Mexico. There are countries subjet
to the viceroy of Peru fill farther from Lima. The people in
those remote diftrits, could hardly be said to enjoy the benefit
of civil government. The oppression and insolence of its in-
ferior ministers they often feel, and rather submit to there
in silence, than involve themselves in the expence and trouble
of reporting to the distant capitals, where alone they can find
redress. As a remedy for this, a fourth vice-royalty has been New vie-

erected, to thejurifdidion of which are fubjedted the provinces August 1776,
of Rio de la Plata, Buenos-Ayres, Paraguay, Tucuman, Potofi, °PlatO de la
Sts. Cruz de la Sierra, Charcas, and the towns of Mendoza and
St. Juan. By this well-judged arrangement, two advantages
are gained. All the inconveniences occasioned by the remote
situation of those provinces, which had been long felt, and long
complained of, are removed. The countries molt diflant from
Lima are separated from the vice-royalty of Peru, and united
under a superior, whose feat of government at Buenos-Ayres
will be commodious and accessible. The contraband trade with
the Portuguese, which was become so extensive, as mufft have
put a final op to the exportation of commodities fiom Spain
to her southern colonies, may be checked more thoroughly, and
with greater facility, when the supreme magiftratc, by his vi.
cinity to the places in which it is carried on, can view its pro-
grefs and cffels with his own eyes. Don Pedro Zevallos, who
has been railed to this new dignity, with appointments equal

B o o K to those of the other viceroys, is well acquainted both with the

VIII.
_.-,- .j fate and the interest of the countries over which he is to pre-

fide, having served in them long, and with diftinacion. By this
dismemberment, succeeding that which took place at the erection
of the vice-royalty of the New Kingdom of Granada, almost
two-third parts of the territories originally subject to the vice-
roys of Peru, are now lopped off from their jurifdiion.

New govern- THE limits of the vice-royalty of New Spain have likewise
ment in pro-
,inces osSo- been cfiderably circumscribed, and with no less propriety
olra, &c. and discernment. Four of its most remote provinces, Sonora,

Cinaloa, California, and New Navarre, have been formed into
a separate government. The Chevalier de Croix, who is in-
trufled with this command, is not dignified with the title of viceroy,
nor does he enjoy the appointments belonging to that rank, but
his jurifdiaion and authority is altogether independent on the
vice-royalty of New Spain. The erecion of this last government
seems to have been suggested, not only by the consideration of
the remote situation of those provinces from Mexico; but by at-
tention to the late discoveries made there, which I have men-
tionedy. Countries containing such riches, and which probably
may rife into such importance, required the immediate infpec-
tion of a governor, to whom they were specially committed.
As every consideration of duty, of interest, and of vanity,
must concur in prompting those new governors to encourage
such exertions as tend to diffuse opulence and prosperity through
the provinces committed to their charge, the beneficial effets of
this arrangement may be considerable. Many diftrias in Ame-

tion been so entirely engrossed by what related to the more re-
mote parts of their dominions, as to render them neglecful of
what was still more important, the reformation of domestic
errors and defecas in policy. Fully sensible of the causes to
which the declension of Spain, from her former prosperity,
ought to be imputed; they have made it a great object of their
policy, to revive a spirit of industry among their fubjeds, and
to give such extent and perfetion to their manufactures, that
they may be able to supply the demands of America from their
own flock, and to exclude foreigners from a branch of com-
merce which has been so fatal to the kingdom. This they have
endeavoured to accomplish, by a variety of edidcs issued since
the peace of Utrecht. They have granted bounties for the en-
couragement of some branches of indufry; they have lowered
the taxes on others; they have prohibited, or have loaded with
additional duties, such foreign manufacures as come in competi-
tion with them; they have inflituted societies for the improve-
ment of trade and agriculture; they have planted colonies of
husbandmen in ome uncultivated diflris of Spain, and divid-
ed among them the wafle fields; they have had recourse to
every expedient, deviled by commercial wisdom, or commercial
jealousy, for reviving their own induflry, and difcountcnancing
that of other nations. These, however, it is not my province to

VIII.
s is no effort of legislation more arduous, no experiment in po-

licy more uncertain, than an attempt to revive the spirit of in-
duflry where it has declined, or to introduce it where it is un-
known. Nations already possessed of extensive commerce, en-
ter into competition with such advantages, derived from the
large capitals of their merchants, the dexterity of their manu-
facurers, the alertness acquired by habit in every department
of business, that the late which aims at rivalling, or supplant-
ing them, must expect to struggle with many difficulties, ad
be content to advance slowly. If the quantity of productive in-
duftry now in Spain, be compared with that of the kingdom
-under the last listless monarchs of the Aufirian line, its progress
must appear considerable, and is sufficient to alarm the jealousy,
and to call forth the most vigorous efforts of the nations now in
possession of the lucrative trade which the Spaniards aim at
wresting from them. One circumstance may render those exer-
tions of Spain an objec of more serious attention to the other
European powers. They are not to be ascribed wholly to the
influence of the crown and its ministers. The sentiments and
spirit of the people seem to second the provident care of their
monarchs, and to give it greater effca. They have adopted
more liberal ideas, not only with refpeEt to commerce, but do-
meftic policy. In all their later writers, defects in their ar-
rangements concerning both are acknowledged, and remedies
proposed, which pride would not have allowed their ancestors
to confess, and ignorance rendered them incapable of difccrn-

activity.

STILL, however, the commercial regulations of Spain with Contraband

refped to her colonies, are too rigid and fyllematical to be carri- trade
ed into complete execution. The legislature that loads trade
with impositions too heavy, or fetters it by reftridions too fe-
vere, defeats its own intention; and, in truth, is only multi-
plying the inducements to violate its statutes, and proposing an
high premium to encourage illicit traffic. The Spaniards, both
in Europe and America, circumscribed in their mutual inter-
course by the jealousy, or oppressed by the exaions of the
crown, have their invention continually on the firetch how to
elude its ediEts. The vigilance and ingenuity of private in-
terest discover means of effecing this, which public wisdom
cannot foresee, nor public authority prevent. This spirit,
counteracting that of the laws, pervades the commerce of
Spain with America in all its branches; and from the highest
departments in government, descends to the lowest. The very
officers appointed to check contraband trade, are often employ-
ed as infiruments in carrying it on ; and the boards infituted to
restrain and punish it, are the channels through which it flows.
The king is supposed to be defrauded by various artifices, of
more than one half of the revenue which he ought to receive
fom America Y; and as long as it is the intcrcfl of so many per-
ions to screen thole artifices from detedion, the knowledge of
them will never reach the throne. " How many ordinancec,

From it an active commercial intercourse began with the Chinese, ..--
and a considerable number of that industrious people, allured by
the profpet of gain, fettled in the Philippines under the
Spanish protetion. They supplicd the colony so amply with
all the valuable productions and manufactures of the East, as
enabled it to open a trade with America, by a course of navi-
gation, the longest from land to land on our globe. In the in-
fancy of this trade, it was carried on with Callao, on the coast
of Peru ; but experience having difcovcred many diflicultics in
this mode of communication, the ftaplc of this commerce be-
tween the east and weft was removed from Callao to Acapulco,
on the coast of New Spain.

AFTER various arrangements, it has been brought into a re-

gular form. One or two ships depart annually from Acapulco,
which may carry out silver to the amount of five hundred thouland
pesos', but have hardly any thing elfc of value on board; in re-
turn for which, they bring back spices, drugs, china, and japan
wares, calicoes, chintz, muslins, silks, and every precious article,
with which the benignity of the climate, or the ingenuity of
its people, have enabled the East to supply the reft of the world.
For some time the merchants of Peru were admitted to partici-
pate in this traffic, and might fend annually a ship to Acapul-
co, to wait the arrival of the veflEls from Manila, and receive
a proportional fhiarc of the commodities which they imported. At
length, the Peruvians were excluded by mofi rigorous ediCd's,
and all the commoditics from the East rclcrved folcly for the
consumption of New Spain.

B o K IN consequence of this indulgence, the inhabitants of that

'-- country enjoy advantages unknown in the other Spanish co-

lonies. The manufactures of the East are not only more suitcd
to a warm climate, and more showy than those of Europe, but
can be fold at a lower price ; while, at the fame time, the pro-
fits upon them are so considerable, as to enrich all thofc who are
employed, either in bringing them from Manila, or vending
them in New Spain. As the interest both of the buyer and
feller concurred in favouring this branch of commerce, it con-
tinued to extend in spite of regulations, concerted with the
most anxious jealousy to circumscribe it. Under cover of what
the laws permit to be imported, vast quantities of India goods
are poured into the markets of New Spain , and when the flota
arrives at Vera Cruz, it often finds the wants of the people al-
ready supplied by cheaper and more acceptable commodities.

THERE is not in the commercial arrangements of Spain, any

circumstance more inexplicable than the permission of this trade
between New Spain and the Philippines, or more repugnant to
its fundamental maxim of holding the colonies in perpetual de-
pendance on the mother-country, by prohibiting any commer-
cial intcrcourfc that might suggest to them the idea of re-
ceiving a supply of their wants from any other quarter. This
permifion must appear ltill more extraordinary, from confider-
ing that Spain hcrl;lf carries on no direCt trade with her fcttle-
ments in the Phili!,l;iin.s, and grants a privilege to one of her
American colonies, which he denies to her fubjccs in Europe.
It is probable, that the colonifis which originally took pon'lclion

gun this intercourse with a country which they confidered, in B o K
some measure, as their parent state, before the court of Madrid
was aware of its consequences, or could eflablifh regulations in
order to prevent it. Many remonstrances have been presented
against this trade, as detrimental to Spain, by diverting into
another channel, a large portion of that treasure which ought to
flow into the kingdom, as tending to give rife to a spirit of in-
dependence in the colonies, and to encourage innumerable
frauds, againf which it was impossible to guard, in tranfadions
so far removed from the infpedion of government. But as it
rcquircs no flight effort of political wisdom and vigour to abolish
any pracicc, which numbers are interefled in supporting, and to
which time has added the fandtion of its authority, the commerce
betwixt Acapulco and Manila seems to be as considerable as ever,
and may be confidered as one chief cause of the elegance and
splendor conspicuous in this part of the Spanifli dominions.

portation of foreign commodities, or by the fraudulent arts of

able frum from their American dominions. This arifSs from taxes
of various kinds, which may be divided into three capital
branches. The first contains what is paid to the king, as fove-
rcign, or filpcrior lord of the New World : to this class belongs
the duty on the gold and ilver railed from the mines, and the
tribute cxadlcd fromn tlhe Indians; the former is termed by the
Spaniards the ig lt ofJfniory, the lalter is the dty of vqfa/lagL.

adminiflrator of ecclesiastical funds in the New World. In
consequence of this he receives the first fruits, annats, spoils,
and other spiritual revenues, levied by the apostolic chamber in
Europe; and is entitled, likewise, to the profit arising from the
sale of the bull of Cruzado. This, which is published every
two years, contains, an absolution from palt offences by the
pope, and, among other immunities, a permiflion to eat several
kinds of prohibited food, during Lent, and on meagre days.
The monks employed in dispersing those bulls, extol their
virtues with all the fervour of interested eloquence; the people,
ignorant and credulous, liften with implicit assent; and every
person in the Spanish colonies, of European, Crcolian, or mixed
race, purchases a bull, which is deemed essential to his falva-
tion, at the rate set upon it by government'.
Its amount, WHAT may be the amount of those various finds, it is

almost impoflible to determine with precision. The extent
of the Spanish dominions in America, the jealousy of go-
vernment, which renders them inaccessible to foreigners, the
mysterious silence which the Spaniards are accuflomed to observe
with refped to the interior tfate of their colonies, combine in
covering this subjed with a veil which it is not easy to remove.
But an account, apparently no less accurate, than it is curious,
has lately been publiflhed of the royal revenue in New Spain,
from which we may form ome idea with refpe to what is
collected in the other provinces. According to that account,

half Inuft be deducted as the expence of the provincial establish-
ment . Peru, it is probable, yields a um not inferior to this,
and if we fippofe that all the other regions of America, includ-
ing the islands, furnish a third share of equal value; we ilall
not perhaps be far wide from the truth, if we conclude, that
the net public revenue of Spain, railed in America, does not
exceed a million and a half fierling. This falls far flort of
the immense fums, to which suppositions, founded upon con-
jeture, have raised the Spanifi revenue in America . It is
remarkable, however, upon one account. Spain and Portugal
are the only European powers, who derive a direc revenue
from their colonies, as their quota towards defraying the general
expence of government. All the advantage that accrues to
other nations, from their American dominions, arises from the
exclusive enjoyment of their trade; but beside this, Spain has
brought her colonies to contribute to increase the power of the
state; and in return for protection, to bear a proportional share
of the common burden.

Spanish revenue from America, comprehends only the taxes

Expence of BUT if the revenue which Spain draws from America be
adminifira-
ioi.ra- great, the expence ofadminiftration in her colonies bears pro-

portion to it. In every department, even of her domeflic po-
lice and finances, Spain has adopted a system more complex,
and more encumbered with a variety of tribunals, and a multi-
tude of officers, than that of any European nation, in which the
sovereign possesses such extensive power. From the jealous fpi-
rit with which ihe watches over her American settlements, and
lier endeavours to guard against fraud in provinces so remote
from infpe&ion; boards and officers have been multiplied there
with ill more anxious attention. In a country where the ex-
pence of living is great, the salaries allotted to every person in
public office must be high, and must load the revenue with an
immense burden. The parade of government greatly augments
the weight of it. The viceroys of Mexico, Peru, and the New
Kingdom of Granada, as representatives of the king's person,
among people fond of ostentation, maintain all the state and
dignity of royalty. Their courts are formed upon the model of
that at Madrid, with horse and foot guards, a household regular-
ly eRablifhed, numerous attendants, and ensigns of power, dif-
playing such pomp, as hardly retains the appearance of a dele-
gated authority. All the expence incurred by supporting the
external and permanent order of government is defrayed by the
crown. The viceroys have betides peculiar appointments suited
to their exalted station. The salaries fixed by law are indeed
extremely moderate, that of the viceroy of Peru is only thirty
thousand ducats; and that of the viceroy of Mexico, twenty

thoufardi

thousand ducats'. Of late, they have been raised to forty BOO K

thousand. V.

TH ESE salaries, however, constitute but a small part of their

revenue. The exercise of an absolute authority extending to
every department of government, and the power of disposing
of many lucrative offices, affords to them innumerable oppor-
tunities of accumulating wealth. To these, which may be
confidered as legal and allowed emoluments, vast fums arc often
added by exactions, which in countries so far removed from the
feat of government, it is not easy to discover, and impoflible
to restrain. By monopolizing some branches of commerce, by
a lucrative concern in others, by conniving at the fiauds of
merchants, a viceroy may raise such an annual revenue, as no
subjea of any European monarch enjoys . From the ingle article
of presents made to him on the anniversary of his Name-day
(which is always observed as an high fcftival), I am informed
that a viceroy has been known to receive ixty thousand pclbs.
According to a Spanish faying, the legal revenues of a viceroy
are known, his real profits depend upon his opportunities and
his conscience. (Conscious of this, the kings of Spain, as I have
formerly obierved, grant a commilon to their viceroy only for
a few years. This circumlance, however, renders them oftcn
more rapacious, and adds to the ingenuity and ardor wherewith
they labour to improve every moment of power which they
know is hastening fail to a period ; and fiort as its duration
is, it usually affords fufficicnt time for repairing a liattered
fortune, or creating a new one. But even in ituations so try-
ing to human frailty, there arc inftanccs of virtue that remain

N T E I. p. i.
O UR knowledge of the events which happened in the con-

quest of New Spain, is derived from sources of information

more original and authentic than that of any tranfaftion in the hiltory
of America. The letters of Cortes to the Emperor Charles V. are
the most valuable of there, and the first in order of time. As Cortes
early affurned a command independent of Velasquez, it became ne-
ceffary to convey such an account of his operations to Madrid, as
might procure him the approbation of his sovereign.

THE first of his dispatches has never been made public. It was

sent from Vera-Cruz, July 16th, 1519. It must have come to the
Emperor's hands while he was in Germany, as he left Spain on the
22d of May in that year, in order to receive the imperial crown. I
have made diligent search for a copy of this dispatch, both in Spain
and in Germany, but without success. This, however, is of les con-
sequence, as it could not contain any thing very material, being writ-
ten so oon after Cortes arrived in New Spain. The second dispatch,
dated OCtober 3oth, 1520, was published at Seville, A. D. 1522, and

3 L 2 the

the third and fourth oon after they were received. A Latin tranfla-
tion of them appeared in Germany A. D. 1532. Ramulio oon as-
ter made them more generally known, by inserting them in his valu-
able collection. They contain a regular and minute history of the ex-
pedition, with many curious particulars concerning the policy and
manners of the Mexicans. The work does honour to Cortes; the
flyle is simple and perspicuous; but as it was manifestly his interest to
represent his own ations in the fairest light, his victories are probably
exaggerated, his losses diminished, and his ats of rigour and violence
somewhat softened.

THE next in order is the Cronica de la Nueva Efpagna, by Francisco

Lopez de Gomara, publilhed A. D. 1554. Gomara's historical merit
is considerable. His mode of narration is clear, flowing, always
agreeable, and sometimes elegant. But he is frequently inaccurate
and credulous ; and as he was the domestic chaplain of Cortes after
his return from New Spain, and probably composed his work at his
desire, it is manifest that he labours to magnify the merit of his hero,
and to conceal or extenuate lfch tranfations as were unfavourable to
his character. Of this Herrera accuses him in one instance, Dec. ii.
lib. iii. c. 2. and it is not once only that this is conspicuous. He
writes, however, with so much freedom concerning several measures
of the Spaniflh court, that the copies both of his Hiftoria de las Indias,
and of his Cronica, were called in by a decree of the council of the
Indies, and they were long confidered as prohibited books in Spain,
though of late licence to print them has been granted. Pinelo
Biblioth. 59.

TE Chronicle of Gomara induced Bernal Diaz del Castillo to comn-

pose his Hiftoria Verdadera de la Conquifta de la' Nueva Efpagna. He
had been an adventurer in each of the expeditions to New Spain, and
was the companion of Cortes in all his battles and perils. When he
found that neither he himself, nor many of his fellow-foldiers
were once mentioned by Gomara, but that the fame of all their

4 exploits
444

exploits was ascribed to Cortes; the gallant old veteran laid hold
of his pen with indignation, and composed his true history. It
contains a prolix, minute, confused narrative of all Cortes's opera-
tions, in such a rude vulgar style as might be expected from an illi-
terate soldier. But as he relates transactions of which he was witness,
and in which he performed a considerable part, his account bears all
the marks of authenticity, and is accompanied with such a pleasant
naivete, with such intereffing details, with such amusing vanity, and
yet so pardonable in an old soldier who had been (as he boasts) in a
hundred and nineteen battles, as renders his book one of the most
singular that is to be found in any language.

PET. Martyr ab Angleria in a Treatise de Infulis nuper inven-

tis, added to his Decades de rebus Oceanicis & novo orbe, gives
some account of Cortes's expedition. But he proceeds no farther
than to relate what happened after his firfi landing. This work,
which is brief and flight, seems to contain the information tranfiitted
by Cortes in his firfl dispatches, embellished with several particulars
communicated to the author by the officers who brought the letters
from Cortes.

BUT the book to which the greater part of modern historians have

had recourse for information concerning the conquest of New Spain,
is Hiftoria de la Conquifta de Mexico, per D. Antonio de Solis, first
published A. D. 1684. I know no author in any language whole li-
terary fame has risen so far beyond his real merit. De Solis is reckon-
ed by his countrymen one of the purest writers in the Cafilian tongue
and if a foreigner may venture to give his opinion concerning a matter
of which Spaniards alone are qualilicd tojudge, he is intitlcd to that
praise. But, though his language be correl, his tafie in composition
is far from being just. I-lis periods are so much L;lbourcd as to be
often fliff, and bometimes tumid; the figures, whiclh h employs by
way of ornament, are triteior Itnproper, and his ob(fi-rvations I'uperfici;l.
These blemilhcs, however, might easily be overlooked, if hlc were

not

445

not defecive with refpeE to all the great qualities of an historian.
Destitute of that patient industry in research, which conduEcs to the
knowledge of truth; a stranger to that impartiality which weighs
evidence with cool attention, and ever eager to etablifh his fa-
vourite system of exalting the chara&er of Cortes into that of a per-
fest hero, exempt from error, and adorned with every virtue, he is
less solicitous to discover what was true, than to relate what might ap-
pear splendid. When he attempts any critical discussion, his reasonings
are fallacious, and founded upon an imperfect view of sacs. Though
he ometimes quotes the dispatches of Cortes, he seems not to have
confuked them; and though he sets out with ome censure on Gomara,
he frequently prefers his authority, the most doubtful of any, to that
of the other contemporary historians.

BUT of all the Spanish writers, Herrera furnishes the fullest and

most accurate information concerning the conquest of Mexico, as well
as every other tranfa&ion in America. The indufry and attention
with which he consulted not only the books, but the original papers
and public records, which tended to throw any light upon the subjec
of his enquiries, were so great, and he usually judges of the evidence
before him with so much impartiality and candour, that his decads
may be ranked among the most judicious and useful historical collec-
tions. If, by attempting to relate the various occurrences in the New
World in a stria chronological order, the arrangement of events in
his work had not been rendered so perplexed, difconneted, and ob-
fcure, that it is an unpleasant task to collet from different parts of
his book, and piece together the detached shreds of a story, he might
justly have been ranked among -the most eminent historians of his
country. He gives an account of the materials from which he com-
posed his work, Dec. vi, lib. iii. c. 9.

N those different conflits, the Spaniards loft only two men, but
had a considerable number wounded. Though there be no occa-

sion for recourse to any supernatural cause to account either for the
greatness of their vi&orie, or the fmadUnefs of their loss, the Spanilh
historians fail not to ascribe both to the patronage of St. Jago, the tu-
telar Saint of their country, who, as they relate, fought at the head
of their countrymen, and by his prowess gave a turn to the fate of
the battle. Gomara is the first who mentions this apparition of St.
James. It is amusing to observe the embarrassment of B. Diaz de Caf-
tillo, occasioned by the struggle between his superstition and his vera-
city. The former disposed him to believe this miracle, the latter re-
strained him from affirming it. " I acknowledge, fays he, that all
our exploits and victories are owing to our Lord Jesus Christ, and
that in this battle there was such a number of Indians to every one of
us, that if each had thrown a handful of earth they might have buried
us, if by the great mercy of God we had not been protected. It may
be that the person whom Gomara mentions as having appeared on a
mottled grey horse, was the glorious apostle Signor St. Jago or
Signor St. Pedro; and that I, as being a finner, was not worthy to
fee him. This I know, that I saw Francisco de Morla on such a
horse, but as an unworthy transgressor, did not deserve to fee any of
the holy apofles. It may have been the will of God, that it was so
as Gomara relates, but until I read his Chronicle I never heard among
any of the conquerors that such a thing had happened." Cap. 34.

incredible, and Gomara mentions a circumstance which thews, that
nothingextraordinary happened on this occaGion. This rich present
had been prepared for Grijalva, when he touched at the fame place
some months before, and was now ready to be delivered, as oon as
Montezuma sent orders for that purpose. Gomara, Cron. c. xxvii;

ACCORDING to B. Diaz del Castillo, the value of the silver plate

representing the moon, was alone above twenty thousand pesos, about
five thousand pounds Sterling.

NOTE VII. p. 22.
THIS private traffic was directly contrary to the inffrutions of

Velasquez, who enjoined, that whatever was acquired by trade

should be thrown into the common flock. But it appears, that the
soldiers had each a private assortment of toys, and other goods pro-
per for the Indian trade, and Cortes gained their favour by encou-
raging this under-hand barter. B. Diaz, c. 41.

GOMARA has publ.fhed a catalogue of the various articles of

which this present consisted. Cron. c. 49. P. Martyr abAngle-

ria, who saw them after they were brought to Spain, and who seems
to have examined them with great attention, gives a description of
each, which is curious, as it conveys some idea of the progrels which

TPHERE is no circumnlance in the history of the conquce of

America, which is more qiuellionale than the account of the

nimerous armies brotu!ht into the fiell ;gainsl thle Spaliarcls. As the
VoL. 1I. 3 M war

war with the Tlafcalans, though of Ihort duration, was one of the
most considerable which they waged in America, the account given
of their forces merits ofme attetqOn. The only authentic informa-
tion concerning this is derived from. three authors. Cortes, in his
second dispatch to the emperor, dated at Segura de la Frontera, Oto-
ber 30, 1520, thus estimates the number of their troops in the first
battle 6000oo; in the second battle oo,ooo; in the third battle
150,000. Relat. ap. Ramtf. iii. 228. Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who
was an eye-witness, and.engaged in all the ations of this war, thus
reckons their numbers; in the first battle 3000, p. 43; in the second
battle 6000, ibid. in the third battle 50,00o, p. 45. Gomara, who
was Cortes's chaplain after. his return to Spain, and published his
Cronica in 1552, follows the computation of Cortes, except in the
'second battle, where he reckons the Tlafcalans at 80,000, p 49. It
was manifeltly the interest of Cortes to magnify his own dangers and
exploits. For it was only by the merit of extraordinary services, that
he could hope to atone for his irregular condu6t, in assuming an in.
dependent command. Bern. Diaz, though abundantly disposed to
place his own prowess, and that of his fellow-conquerors in the moll
advantageous point of light, had not the fame temptation to exagge-
rate; and, it is probable, that his account of the numbers approaches
nearer to the truth. The assembling of an army of .5o,ooo men re-
quires many previous arrangements, and such provision for their sub-
fitence as feemns to be beyond the foresight of Americans. The degree
ofcultivation in Tlafcala does not seem to have been so great, as to have
furnished such a vast army with provisions. Though this province
was so much better cultivated than other regions of New Spain, that
it was called the country of bread; yet the Spaniards in their march
suffered such want, that they were obliged to subsist upon fTunas, a
species of fruit which grows wild in the fields. Herrera, Dec. ii..

T HESE unhappy vidtims are said to be persons of diftin"ion.

It seems improbable that so great a number as fifty should be

employed as spies. So many prisoners had been taken and difmifled,
and the Tlafcalans had sent so many messages to the Spanifli quarters,
that there appears to be no reafbn for hazarding the lives of so many
considerable people, in order to procure information about the position
and state of their camp. The barbarous manner in which Cortes treated
a people unacquainted with the laws of war eftabliihed among polihed
nations, appears so shocking to the later Spaniih writers, that they
diminish the number of those whom he punished so cruelly. Herrera
fays, that he cut off the hands of seven, and the thumbs of ome more.
Dec. ii. lib. ii. c. 8. De Solis relates, that the hands of fourteen or
fifteen were cut off, and the thumbs of all the reft. Lib. ii. c. 20.

affirm, that the hands of all the fifty were cut off.

THE horses were objects of the greatest aonifhment to all the

people of New Spain. At firit they imagined the horse and his

rider, like the Centaurs of the ancients, to be some monstrous animal of
a terrible form; and supposing, that their food was the fame as that
of men, brought flesh and bread to nourish them. Even after they
discovered their mistake, they believed the horses devoured men in
battle, and when they neighed, thought that they were demanding
their prey. It was not the interefit of the Spaniards to undeceive them.

massacre, and it was an a of wanton cruelty, perpetrated mere-

firuyc. p. 17, &c. But the zeal of Las Casas often leads him to exag-
gerate. In opposition to him Bern. Diaz, c. 83, asserts, that the
first miflionaries sent into New Spain by the emperor, made a judicial
inquiry into this tranfaóion and having examined the priests and
elders of Cholula, found that there was a real conspiracy to cut off
the Spaniards, and that the account given by Cortes was exacly
true. As it was the objea of Cortes at that time, and- manifestly his
,interest, to gain the good-will of Montezuma, it is improbable, that
he would have taken a tep which tended so visibly to alienate him
from the Spaniards, if he had not believed' it to be neceffiry for-his
own preservation. At the fame time, the Spaniards who served in
America had such contempt for the natives, and thought them so
little entitled to the common rights of men, that Cortes might hold
the Cholulans as guilty upon flight and imperfe evidence. The fe-
verity of the punishment was certainly excessive and atrocious.

B Diaz del Castillo gives us ome idea of the fatigue and hardflips

they underwent in performing this,. and other parts of duty.

During the nine months that they remained in Mexico, every man,
without any diftin&ion between officers and soldiers, sept on his arms,
in his quilted jacket and gorget. They lay on mats, or straw spread
on the floor, and each was obliged to hold himself as alert as if he
had been on, guard. " This, adds he, became so habitual to me, that
even now in my advanced age, I always sleep in my cloaths, and
never in any bed. When I visit my Encomienda, I reckon it suitable
to my rank, to have a bed carried along with my other baggage, but
I never go into it; but, according to custom, I lie in my-cloaths, and,
walk frequently during the night into the open air, to view the stars:
as I was wont.when in service." Cap. Io8.

and absolutely in his power, the insult offered to that monarch could
have no effect but to irritate him unnecessarily. Gomara luppofes, that

date Montezuma, so that he might make no attempt to rescue the
vitims from their fate; but the spirit of that monarch was so fb-
miflive, and he had so tamely given up the prisoners to the disposal of
Cortes, that he had little to dread from him. If the explanation
which I have attempted to give of Cortes's proceedings on this occa-
sion be not admitted, it appears to me, that they must be reckoned
among the wanton and barbarous as of oppreflion which occur too
often in the history of the conquest of America.

NOTE XVI. p.67.
D E Solis aferts, lib. iv. c. 3. that the proposition of doing homage

to the King of Spain, came from Montezuma himself, and was

fiade in order to induce the Spaniards to depart out of his dominions.
He describes his conduct on this occafio, as if it had been founded
upon a scheme of profound policy, and executed with such refined ad-
dress, as to deceive Cortes himself. But there is no hint or circum-
fiance in the contemporary historians, Cortes, Diaz, or Gomara, to
justify this theory. Montezuma, on other occasions, discovered no
such extent of art and abilitiesl The anguish which he felt in per-
forming this humbling ceremony is natural, if we suppose it to have
been involuntary. But, according to the theory of De Solis, it would
have been preposterous and inconsistent with his own design of deceiv-
ing the Spaniards.

IN feveralof the provinces, the Spaniards, with all their industry

and influence, could colle& no gold. In others, they procured

only a few trinkets of small value. Montezuma aured Cortes, that

mage, conifted of all the treasure anafed by his father; and told
him, that he had already diltributed the reft of his gold and jewels

was oo marks. Relat. 239. B. So that the fum total of silver was

tion, from no better reason than that it was inconsistent with

that prudence which diflinguifhes the character of Cortes. But he
ought to have recolleced the impetuosity of his zeal at Tlafcala, which
was no less imprudent. He asserts, that the evidence for it refts upon
the testimony of B. Diaz del Castillo, of Gomara, and of Herrera.
They all concur indeed, in mentioning this inconsiderate flep which
Cortes took, and they had good reason to do so, for Cortes himself
relates this exploit in his second dispatch to the Emperor, and seems to
glory in it. Cort. Relat. Ramus. iii. 140. D. This is one inftarce,

receive any account of what passed in this interview at Tordefillas, pre-
vious to his holtile preparations against Cortes. His real motives
seem to be those which I have mentioned. The patent appointing him
/,delantado of New Spain, with such extensive powers, bears date
November 13, 1519. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. iii. c. iL. He might re-
ceive it about the beginning of January. Gomara takes notice, that
as soon as this patent was delivered to him, he began to equip a fleet
and levy forces. Cron. c. 96.

D E Solis contends, that as Narvaez had no interpreters, he could hold

no intercourse with the people of the provinces, nor converle

with them in any way but by signs, and that it was equally impoffble
for him to carry on any communication with Montezuma. Lib. iv.
c. 7. But it is upon the authority of Cortes himself that I relate all
the particulars of Narvaez's correspondence, both with Montezuma
and with his subjes in the maritime provinces. Rlelat. Ramu'. iii.

the three deserters who joined Narvaez acted as interpreters, ha ving
acquired a competent knowledge of the language, c. I1o. With his
usual minuteness, he mentions their names and characers, and relates,
in chapter 122, how they were punished for their perfidy. The Spa-
niards had now resided above a year among the Mexicans; and it is
not surprising, that several among them Ihould have made ome profi-
ciency in peaking their language. This seems to have been the cafe.
Herrera, dec. ii. lib. x. c. . Both B. Diaz, who was present, and
Herrera, the moif accurate and best informed of all the Spanish wri-
ters, agree with Cortes in his account of the secret correspondence
carried on with Montezuma. Dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 8, 19. De Solis
seems to confider it as a discredit to Cortes, his hero, that Monte-
zuma should have been ready to engage in a correspondence with Nar-
vaez. He supposes that monarch to have contracted such a wonder-
ful affection for the Spaniards, that he was not solicitous to be deli-
vered from them. After the indignity with which he had been treat-
ed, such an affection is incredible; and even De Solis is obliged to ac-
knowledge, that it must be looked upon as one of the miracles which
God wrought to facilitate the conquest, lib. iv. c. 7. The truth
is, Montezuma, however much overawed by his dread of the Spa-
niards, was extremely impatient to recoverhis liberty.

Ranuf. iii. p. 249, A. But it was manifestly his interest, at that
juncture, to conceal from the court of Spain the full extent of the loss
which he had fuflained. De Solis, always fludious to diminish every
misfortune that besel his countrymen, rates their loss at about two
hundred men. Lib. iv. c. 19. B. Diaz affirms, that they loft 870
men, and that only 440 escaped from Mexico, c. 128, p. o8. b.
Palafox, bishop of Los Angeles, who seems to have inquired into the
early tranfations of his countrymen in New Spain, with great atten-
tion, confirms the account of B. Diaz with refpea to the extent of
tli-ir loss. Virtudes del Indio, p. 22. Gomara ifates their loss at

brought 880 men into New Spain, and about 400 of Cortes's soldiers
were then alive, it is evident, that his loss in the retreat from Mexico
muf have been much more considerable than what he mentions. B. Diaz,
Iblicitous to magnify the dangers and sufferings to which he and his
fellow-conquerors were exposed, may have exaggerated their loss;
but, in my opinion, it cannot well be estimated at less than 600 men.

picion, he describes with his usual simplicity the impreflion which this
fpecacle made upon him. " Before, fays he, I saw the breafls of
my companions opened, their hearts yet fluttering, offered to an ac-
cursed idol, and their flesh devoured by their exulting enemies; I was
accustomed to enter a battle not only without fear, but with high
spirit. But from that time I never advanced to fight the Mexicans
without a secret horror and anxiety, my heart trembled at the thoughts
of the death which I had seen them fufler." He takes care to add, that
as soon as the combat began this terror went off; and, indeed, his ad-
venturous bravery on every occasion is full evidence of this. B. Diaz,
c. 156. . 157, a.

NOTE XXV. p. 125.
O N E circumfiance in this siege merits particular notice. The ac-

count which the Spanish writers give of the numerous armies

employed in the attack or defence of Mexico, seems to be incredible.
According to Cortes himself, he had at one time 150,000 auxiliary
Indians in his service. Relat. Ramus. iii. 275, E. Gomara asserts,
that they were above 200,000. Cron. c. 36. Herrera, an author of
higher authority, fays, they were about 200,000. Dec. iii. lib, i.
c. 19. None of the contemporary writers ascertain explicitly the
number of persons in Mexico during the liege. But Cortes on several
occasions mentions the number of Mexicans who were slain, or who
perished for want of food ; and, if we may rely on thoe circumltances,
it is probable, that above two hundred thoufind nmufl have been shut
up in the town. But the quantity of provisions necessary for the Lfb-
liltcnce of iich valt multitudes assembled in one place during three
months is so grcat, and it requires o much foresight and arrangement
to collect them, so as to be certain of a regular supply, that one can
hardly believe that this couldl be accompliflied in a country where
agriculture was to imperfec& as in the Mexican empire, where there
were no tame animals, and by a people naturally lb improvident, and

3N 2 so

so incapable of executing a complicated plan as the most improved
Americans. The Spaniards, with all their care and attention, fared
very poorly, and were often reduced to extreme distress from want
of provisions. B. Diaz, p. 142. Cortes Relat. 271, D. Cortes on one
occasion mentions slightly the subsistence of his army; and after
acknowledging, that they were often in great want, adds, that they
received supplies from the people of the country, of fish, and of some
fruit, which he calls the cherries of the country, Ibid. B. Diaz
fays, that they had cakes of maize, and cerafas de la tierra; and when
the season of these was over, another fruit, which he calls Tunas; but
their most comfortable fubfitence was a root which the Indians use as
food, to which he gives the name of uilites, p. 142, The Indian
., auxiliaries had one means of subsistence more than the Spaniards. They
fed upon the bodies of the Mexicans whom they killed in battle. Cort.
Relat, 176, C. . Diaz confirms his relation, and adds, that when
the Indians returned from Mexico to their own. country, they carried
with them large quantities of the fle(h of the Mexicans salted or dried,
as a most acceptable present to their friends, that they might have the
pleasure of feeding on the bodies of their enemies in. their feffivals.
p. 157. De Solis, who seems to confider it as an imputation of difcre-
dit to his countrymen, that they should a in,concert:with auxiliaries
who fed upon human flesh, is solicitous to prove, that they en-
deavoured to prevent their associates from eating the bodies of the
Mexicans, lib. v. c. 24. But he has no authority for this from the
original historians. Neither Cortes himself, nor B. Diaz, seem to have
had any such scruple; and, on many occasions, mention the Indian
repasts, which were become familiar to them, without any mark of
abhorrence. Even with this additional flock of food for the Indians,
it was hardly possible to procure subsistence for armies amounting to
such numbers as we find in the Spanish writers. Perhaps, the befl so-
lution of the difficulty is, to adopt the opinion of B. Diaz del Caflillo,
the most artless of all the lliforiadores primnilivos. " When Gomara,
fays he, on ome occasions relates, that there were so many thousand
Indians our auxiliaries, and on others, that there were so many thou-

find houses in this or that town, no regard is to be paid to his enume-
ration, as he has no authority for it, the numbers not being in reality
the fifth of what he relates. If we add together the different numbers
which he mentions, that country would contain more millions than
there are in Castile." C. 129. But though ome considerable deduc-
tion should certainly be made from the Spanish accounts of the Mexi-
can forces;. they must have been very numerous, for nothing but an
immense superiority in number, could have enabled them to withstand
a body of nine hundred Spaniards, commanded by a general of such
abilities as Cortes.

NOTE XXVI. p. 138.

N relating the oppressive and cruel proceedings of the conquerors
of New Spain, I have not followed B. de las Casas as my guide.

His account of them,. Relat. de la Deftruyc. p. 8, &c. is manifefily
exaggerated. It is from the testimony of Cortes himself and Gomara,
who wrote under his eye, that I have taken my account of the punish-
ment of the Panucans, and they relate it without any disapprobation.
B. Diaz, contrary to his usual custom, mentions it only in general
terms, c. 62. Herrera, solicitous to extenuate this barbarous a-
tion of his countrymen, though he mentions 60 caziqucs, and 400
men of note, as being condemned to the flames, asserts, that thirty on-
ly were burnt, and the reft pardoned. Dec. iii. lib. v. c. 7. But this
is contrary to the testimony of the original hillorians, particularly of
Gomara, whom it appears he had consulted, as he adopts several of
his expreflions in this passage. The punishment of Guatimozin is re-
lated by the most authentic of the Spanish writers. Torquemada has
extracted from a hiltory of Tezeuco, composed in the Mexican tongue,
an account of this tranfaftion, more favourable to Guatimozin than
that of the Spanilh authors. Mon. Indiana, i. 575. According to
that account, Cortes had scarcely a shadow of evidence tojultify such
a wanton a: of cruelty. B. Diaz affirms, that Guatimozin and his
fcllow-fufferers asserted their innocence with their last breath, and that

HE motive for undertaking this expedition was, to punish Chris-
toval de Olid, one of his officers who had revolted against him,

and aimed at establishing an independent jurifdiEtion. Cortes regard-
ed this infurretion as of such dangerous example, and dreaded so
much the abilities and popularity of its author, that in person he led
the body of troops deltined to suppress it. He marched, according
to Gomara, three thousand miles, through a country abounding with
-thick forests, rugged mountains, deep rivers, thinly inhabited, and
cultivated only in a few places. What he suffered from famine, from
the hostility of the natives, from the climate, and from hardships of
every species, has nothing in history parallel to it, but what occurs in
the adventures of the other discoverers and conquerors of the New
World. Cortes was employed in this dreadful service above two
years, and though it was not distinguished by any splendid event, he
exhibited, during the course of it, greater personal courage, more for-
titude of mind, more perseverance and patience, than in any other
period or scene in his life. Herrera, dec. iii. lib. vi. vii. viii. ix. Go-

ACCORDING to Herrera, the treasure which Cortes brought

with him, consisted of fifteen hundred marks of wrought plate,

two hundred thousand pesos of fine gold, and ten thousand of inferior
standard, many rich jewels, one in particular worth forty thouliand
pesos, and several trinkets and ornaments of value. Dec. iv. lib. iii.

fortune which he left his sons was very considerable. But as we have
before related, the fum divided among the conquerors on the first
reduction of Mexico was very small. There appears then to be ome
reason for fufpecing that the accufarions of Cortes's enemies were not
altogether destitute of foundation. They charged him with having
unjuffly applied to his own use a disproportionate hare of the Mexican
spoils; with having concealed the royal treasures of Montezuma and
Guatimozin, with defrauding the king of his fifth, and robbing his
followers of what was due to them. Herrera, dec. iii. lib. viii. c. 15.

suspicions of the fame kind. B. Diaz, c. 157.

NOTE XXIX. p. 147.
I N tracing the progress of the Spanish arms in New Spain, we have

followed Cortes himself as our most certain guide. His dispatches

to the emperor contain a minute account of his operations. But the
unlettered conqueror of Peru was incapable of relating his own ex-
ploits. Our information with refpec: to them is derived however from
contemporary and refpeaable authors.

THE most early account of Pizarro's tranfations in Peru, was pub-

Iifhed by Francisco de Xerez, his secretary. It is a simple unadorned
narrative, carried down no farther than the death of Atahualpa, in
1533; for the author returned to Spain in 1534, and soon after he
landed, printed at Seville his short History of the Conquelt of Peru,
addressed to the emperor.

DON Pedro Sancho, an officer who served under Pizarro, drew up

an account of his expedition, which was translated into Italian by Ra-
mufio, and inserted in his valuable collection, but has never been
published in its original language. Sancho returned to Spain at the
fame time with Xerez. Great credit is due to what both thole authors
relate concerning the progress and operations of Pizarro, but the re-

fidence

463

fidence of the Spaniards in Peru had been so short, at the time when
they left it, and their intercourse with the natives so lender, that their
knowledge of the Peruvian manners and customs is very imperfet.

THE next contemporary historian is Pedro Cieza de Leon, whe

published his Chronica del Peru, at Seville in 153. If he had
finilhed all that he proposes in the general division of his work, it
would have been the most complete history which had been publifled
of any region in the New World. He was well qualified to execute it,
having served during seventeen years in America, and visited in per-
son most of the provinces concerning which he had occasion to write.
But only the first part of his Chronicle has been printed. It contains
a description of Peru, and several of the adjacent provinces, with an
account of the institutions and customs of the natives, and is written
with so little art, and such an apparent regard for truth, that one must
regret the loss of the otherparts of his work,

THIS Idss is amply supplied by Don Augustine Zarate, who publish-

ed, in 1555, his Hiftoria del defcubrimiento y Conquefta de la Pro-
vincia del Peru. Zarate was a man of rank and education, and em-
ployed in Peru as comptroller-general of the public revenue. His
history, whether we attend to its matter or composition, is a book of
considerable merit; as 'he had opportunity to be well informed, and
seems to have been inquisitive with refpe6 to the manners and tranfac-
tions of the Peruvians, great credit is dule to his ctetimony.

DoN Diego Fernandez publilhed his Hiftoria del Peru in 571.

His sole object is to relate the dissensions and civil wars of the Spaniards
in that empire. As he served in a public station in Peru, and was well
acquainted both with the country, and with the principal actors in
those singular scenes which he describes, as he poffefled found under-
standing, and great impartiality, his work may be ranked among tllofe
of the hiltorians most diffinguiflled for their industry in research, or
their capacity in judging with refpet to the events which they relate.

I ThzE
464

THE lall author who can be reckoned among the contemporary

hifforians of the conquest of Peru, is Garcilafo de la Vega, Incai. For
though the first part of his work, intitled, Comentarios Reales del Oii-
gen de los Incas Reies del Pe-u, was not published sooner than the year
1609, feventy-fix years after the death of Atahualpa the last emperor,
yet as he was born in Peru, and was the ion of an officer of dillincion
among the Spanish conquerors, by a Caya, or lady of the royal race,
on account of which he always took the name of Inca, as he was maf-
ter of the language spoken by the Incas, and acquainted with the tra-
ditions of his countrymen, his authority is rated very high, and often
placed above that of all the other historians. His work, however, is
little more than a commentary upon the Spanilh writers of the Peru-
vian story, and conpofied of quotations taken from the authors whom
I have mentioned. This is the idea which he himlelf gives of it, Lib i.
c. o. Nor is it in the account of fats only that he follows them ser-
vilely. Even in explaining the inflitutions and rites of his ancestors,
his information seems not to be more perfect than theirs. His explana-
tion of the Quipos is almost the fame with that of Acofia. He pro-
duces no specimen of Peruvian poetry, but that wretched one which
he borrows from Bias Valera, an early miiflonary, whose memoirs
have never been published. Lib. ii. c. j5. As for composition, ar-
rangement, or a capacity of diftinguifiing between what is fabulous,
what is probable, and what is true, one searches for them in vain in the
commentaries of Inca. His work, however, notwithtlanding its
great defedcs, is not altogether destitute of use. Some traditions
which he received from his countrymen are preserved in it. His
knowledge of the Peruvian language has enabled him to correl ftome
errors of the Spanifl writers, and lie has inserted in it ome curious
fats taken from authors whose works were never published, and are
now loft.

T -IIS extravagant and unfealbnable discourse of Valverde has been

censured by all historians, and with jiflice. But though he seems

to have been an illiterate and bigotced monk, nowise reftinbling the
good Olmedo, wlo accompanied Cortes; the absurdity of his address
to Atahualpa must not be charged wholly upon him. His harangue
is evidently a translation, or paraphrase of that form, concerted by a
junto of Spanish divines and lawyers in the year 1509, for explaining
the right of their king to the sovereignty of the New World, and for
direcling the officers employed in America how they flould take polf
ieflion of any new country. See Vol. i. Note xxiii. The fentilnents con-
tained in Valverde's harangue mult not then be imputed to the bigot-
ted imhecillity of a particular man, but to that of the age. Gomara
and Benzoni relate one circumstance concerning Valvcrde, which, if
authentic, renders him an obje not of contempt only, but of horror.

TWO different systems have been formed concerning the conduc

of Atahualpa. The Spanish writers, in order to justify the vio-

lence of their countrymen, contend, that all the Inca's professions of
friendship were feigned; and that his intention in agreeing to an inter-
view with Pizarro at Caxamalca, was to cut off him and his followers
at one blow; that for this purpose he advanced with such a nume-
rous body of attendants, who had arms concealed under their garments
to execute this scheme. This is the account given by Xerez and Za-
rate, and adopted by Herrera. But if it had been the plan of the Inca
to defroy the Spaniards, one can hardly imagine that he would have
permitted them to march unmolested through the desert of Motupe,
or have neglected to defend the passes in the mountains, where they
might have been attacked with so much advantage. If the Peruvians
marched to Caxamalca with an intention to fall upon the Spaniards, it
is inconceivable, that of so great a body men, prepared for action, not
one hould attempt to make resistance, but all tamely fufferthemfelves to
be butchered by an enemy whom they were armed to attack. Ata-
hualpa's mode of advancing to the interview, has the apect of a
peaceable procession, not of a military enterprize. He hhncflf, and
his followers were, in their habits of ceremony, preceded, as on J;:ys
of solemnity, by unarmed harbingers. Though rude nations are fre-
quently cunning and false,. yet, if a scheme of deception and treachery
must be imputed either to a monarch, that had no great reason to be
alarmed at a visit from flrangers who solicited admiflion into his pre-
fence as friends, or to an adventurer so daring, and so little fcruln-
lous as Pizarro, one cannot hesitate in determining where to fix the
prefumtion of guilt. Even amidlt the endeavours of the Spanifli
writers to palliate the proceedings of Pizarro, one plainly perceives,
that it was his intention, as well as his intercef, to seize the I r.c, anL
that lie had taken measures for that purpose, previous to any fuli)icion
of that monarch's designs,

GARCILASSO
468

GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA, extremely solicitous to vindicate his coun-

trymen, the Peruvians, from the crime of having concerted the deftrrc-
tion of Pizarro and his followers, and no less afraid to charge the Spa-
niards with improper conduct tovards the Inca, has framed another
system. He relates, that a man of majeitic form, with a long beard,
and garments reaching to the ground, having appeared in vision to
Viracocha, the eighth Inca, and declared, that he was a child of the
Sun, that monarch built a temple in honour of this person, and erect-
ed an image of him, resembling as nearly as poflible the singular
form in which he had exhibited himself to his view. In this temple,
divine honours were paid to him, by the name ofViracocha. P. i.
lib. iv. c. 21. lib. v. c. 22. When the Spaniards first appear-
ed in Peru, the length of their beards, and the dress they wore, firuck
every person so much with their likcnefs to the image of Viracocha,
that they supposed them to be children of the Sun, who had descended
from heaven to earth. All concluded, that the fatal period of the I'e-
ruvian empire was now approaching, and that the throne would be oc-
cupied by new pofiefors. Atahualpa himself, confidering the Spa-
niards as neffengers from heaven, was tb far from entertaining any
thoughts of resisting them, that he determined to yield implicit obedi-
ence to their commands. From thole sentiments flowed his professions
of love and refpecl-. To tliole were oing the cordial reception of
Soto and Ferdinand Pizarro in his camp, and the fubmiflive reverence
with which he advanced to vilit the Spanifil gcneral in his quarters.
But from the gross ignorance of l'liiliillo, the interpretcr, the decla-
ration of the Spaniards, and his anfwvcr to it, were so ill expl:ined,
that by their imutual inability to colmprehcnd each other's intentions,
the fatdl rencounter at Cax;iamalca, with all its dreadful conleltuences,
was occasioned.

Jr is remarkable, that no traces of this fuperflitious veneration of

the Peruvians for the Spaniards, are to be foiund either in Xerez, or
Sanclo, or Zarate, previous to the interview at C'ax;lultlca ; and yet

ed Peru soon after the conquest. If either te Inca himself, or his
messengers, had addressed the Spaniards in the words which La Ve'a
put in their mouths, they must have been fruck with such fubmiflive
declarations; and they would certainly have availed theilves of
them to accomplish their own dcfigns with greater facility. La Veca
himself, though his narrative of the intercourle between the Inca and
Spaniards preceding the rencounter at Caxamalca, is founded on tih
supposition of his believing them to be Viracochas, or divine beins.
P. ii. lib. i. c. 17, &c. yet with his usual inattention and inaccuracy
he admits, in another place, that the Peruvians did not recolles te
resemblance between them and the god Viracocha, until the fatal liiaf.
ters subsequent to the defeat at Caxamalca, and then only began to ca!l
,hem Viracochas. P. i. lib. v. c. 2. This is confirmedby Herrera,
dec. v. lib. ii. c. 12. In many different parts of America, if we may
bLlieve the Spanilh writers, their countrymen were confidered as divine
beings who had descended from Heaven. But in this inllance, .s ii

7 O TI IN G can be a more riking proof of this, than that three

Spaniards travelled from Caxamalca to Cuzco. The diltance be-

tween them is fix hundred miles. In every place throughout this val:
extent of country, they were treated with all the honours which the
Peruvians paid to their sovereigns, and even to their divinities. Under
pretext of amanfing what was wanting for the ransom of the Inca, they
demanded the plates of gold with which the walls of the Temple of the
Sun in Cuzco were adorned; and though the prirtis were unwilling to
alienate those sacred ornaments, and the people refused to violate the
hrine of their God, the three Spaniards with their own hands robbed
the Temple of part of this valuable treasure; and such was the re-
verence of the natives for their persons, that though they beheld this
aft of sacrilege witl aflonifhment, they did not attempt to prevent or
disturb thecommiffion of it. Zarate,lib. ii. c. 6. Sancho ap.Ramuf. iii.

Dec. v. lib. viii. c. 4. But as I have observed, vol. i. p. 375, this weapon
is common among several barbarous tribes towards the extremity of
South America; and it is more probable,. that the Peruvians had ob-
served the dexterity with which they used it in hunting, and on this
occasion adopted it themselves. The Spaniards were considerably an-
noyed by it. Herrera, ibid. Another inflance of the ingenuity of
the Peruvians deserves mention. By turning a river out of its chan-
nel, they overflowed a valley, in which a body of Spaniards was post-
ed, so suddenly, that it was with the utmost difficulty they made their
escape. Herrera, dec. v. lib, viii. c. 5

E R R E R A's account of Orellana's voyage is the most minute,
and apparently the mol accurate. It was probably taken from

the journal ofOrellana limiclf. But the dares are not diflincly mark-

February 1 541; and he arrived at the mouth of the river on the 2 6th
of August, having spent near seven months in the voyage. M. de la
Condamine, in the year 1743, Iailed from Cuenca to Para, a fettle-
ment of the Portuguese at the mouth of the river, a navigation much
longer than that of Orellana, in less than four months. Voyage,
p. 179. But the two adventurers were very differently provided for
the voyage. This hazardous undertaking, to which ambition prompted
Orellana, and to which the love of fcicnce led M. de la Condamine, was
undertaken in the year 1769, by Madame Godin des Odonais, from con-
jugal affection. The narrative of the hardfhlips which she suffered, of
the dangers to which ffie was exposed, and of the disasters which befcl
her, is one of the most lingular and affeding stories in any language, ex-
hibiting in her condut a firiking pitlure of the fortitude which diflin-

gentlemen, who had been officers of diflin&ion under Almagro,

lodged in the fame house, and having but one cloak among them, it
was worn alternately by him who had occasion to appear in public,
while the reft, from the want of a decent dress, were obliged to keep
within doors. Their former friend': and companions were so much
afraid of giving offence to Pizarro, that they durst not entertain,
or even converfc with them. One may conceive what was the condi-
tion, and whaó lie indignation of men once accustomed to power and
ppulence, whe; they felt themselves poor and dcfpifed, without a
roof under which to helter their heads, while they beheld others
whose merit and services were not equal to theirs, living with fplcndor

ver the mode of levying tribute from his Indian fubjeds, that would
be most beneficial to the crown, and least opprefive to them, addressed
a mandate to all the Courts of Audience in America, enjoining them
to answer certain queries which he proposed to them, concerning the
ancient form of government established among the various nations of
Indians, and the mode in which they paid taxes to their kings
or chiefs. In obedience to this mandate, Corita, who had resided
nineteen years in America, fourteen of which he passed in New Spain,
composed the work of which I have a copy. He acquaints his so-
vereign, that he had made it an object during his residence in America,
and in all its provinces which he had visited, to inquire diligently into
the manners and customs of the natives, that he had converted for
this purpose with many aged and intelligent Indians, and consulted fe-
veral of the Spanifl ecclesiastics, who understood the Indian languages
most perfectly, particularly some of those who landed in New Spain
soon after the conquest. Corita appears to be a man of some learning,
and to have carried on his inquiries with the diligence and accuracy to
which he pretends. Greater credit is due to his testimony from one
circumfiance. His work was not composed with a view to publica-
tion, or in support of any particular theory, but contains simple, though
full answers to queries proposed to him officially. Though Herrera
does not mention him among the authors whom he had followed as
guides in his history, I flould suppose, from several fadCs of which he
takes notice, as well as from several expressions which he uses, that
this memorial of Corita was not unknown to him.

there were 60,000ooo houses, or families in Mexico. Cron. c. 78. errera
adopts his opinion. ec. ii. lib. vii. c. 13; and the generality of wri-
ters follow them implicitly without inquiry or scruple. According to
this account, the inhabitants of Mexico must have been about 300,ooo.

that there were a hundred and twenty thousand houses or families in
Mexico, and consequently about fix hundred thousand inhabitants.
Lib. iii. c. 23. But in a very judicious account of the Mexican em-
pire, by one of Cortes's officers, the population is fixed at 60,o0o
people. Ramufio, iii. 309, A. Even by this account, which pro..
bably is much nearer the truth than any of the foregoing, Mexico was
a great city.

NOTE L. p. 279.

T is to P. Torribio de Benavente, that I am indebted for this curi-
ous observation. Palafox, biflop of Los Angeles, confirms and

illufRrates it more fully. The Mexican (fays he) is the only language
in which a termination indicating relfpe&, filavas revcrentialesy de cor-
tfia, may be affixed to every word. By adding the final syllable zin,
or azin to any word, it. becomes a proper expreflion of veneration in
the mouth of an inferior. If, in speaking to an equal, the word Father
is to be uled, it is 'lail, but an inferior fays Tatzin. One priefl
speaking to another, calls hiim Teopixgue; a person of inferior rank
calls him 'eopixcatzin. The name of the emperor who reigned when
Cortes invaded Mexico, was ilMoltczuma, but his vaflls, from reve-
rence, pronounced it Aollllrhumiiizin. Torribio, MS. l'laf. Virtudes
del Indio, p. 65. The Mexicans had not only reverential nouns, but

FROM comparing several passages in Corita and Herrera, we may

collet with tome degree of accuracy, the various modes in which

the Mexicans contributed towards the upport of government. Some
persons of the first order seem to have been exempted from the payment
of any tribute, and as their only duty to the public, were bound to
personal service in war, and to.follow the banner of the sovereign with
their vaslals. 2. The immediate vaTals of the crown were bound not
only to personal military service, but paid a certain proportion of the
produce of their lands in kind. 3. Thore who held offices of honour
or trufl, paid a certain fllare of what they received in consequence of
holding these. 4. Each Capulle, or association, cultivated some part
of the common field allotted to it, for the behoof of the crown, and de-
posited the produce in the royal granaries. 5. Some part of what-
ever was brought to the public markets, whether fruits of the earth,
or the various productions of their artists and manufactures, was de-
manded for the public use, and the merchants who paid this were
exempted fiom every other tax. 6. The Alayeques, or adcripti gleba,
were bound to cultivate certain districts in every province, which may
be confidered as crown lands, and brought the increase into public
florehoufes. Thus the sovereign received some part of whatever was
useful or valuable in the country, whether it was the natural produc-
tion of the foil, or acquired by the induflry of the people. What each
contributed towards the support of government, seems to have been
inconsiderable. Corita, in answer to one of the queries put to the
Audience of Mexico by Philip II. endeavours to eimate in money
the value of what each citizen might be supposed to pay, and docs
not reckon it at more than three or four reals, about eighteen pence or
two flillings a head.

I N the armoury of the royal palace of Madrid, are Ihewn suits oft

armour, which are called Montezuma's. They are comnpofed of

i thin lacquered copper plates. In the opinion of very intelligent judges
they are evidently eastern. The forms of the silver ornaments upon
them, representing dragons, &c. may be confidered as a confirimaiion of
this. They are infinitely uperior in point of workmanflip to any effort
of American art. TheSpaniards probably received them from the Philip.
pine islands. The only unqueflionable Ipecimen of Mexican art that I
know of in Great Britain, is a cup of very fine gold, which is aid to
have belonged to Montezuma. It weighs 5 oz. 12 dwt. 7hree

face, on the other the profile, on the third the back parts of the head.

T H E learned reader will perceive how much I have been indebted,

in this part of my work, to the guidance of the bishop of Glou-

cefter, who has traced the fuccefnive steps, by which the human mind
advanced in this line of its progress, with much erudition, and greater
ingenuity. He is the first, as far as I know, who formed a rational and
consistent theory concerning the various modes of writing pracftifed by
nations, according to the various degrees of their improvement. Div.
Legation of Moses, iii. 69, &c. Some important observations have been
added by the learned and intelligent author of the Traite de la Forma-
tion Mechanique des Langues, tom. i. 295, &c.

As the Mexican paintings are the most curious monuments extant

of the earliest mode of writing, it will not be improper to give some
account of the means by which they'were preserved from the general
wreck of every work of art in America, and communicated to the
Public. For the most early and complete collection of these publifl-
ed by Purchas, we are indebted to the attention of that curious in-
quirer, Hakluyt. Don Antonio Mendoza, viceroy of New Spain, hav-
ing deemed tlofe paintings a proper present for Charles V. the Ihip
in which they were ent to Spain, was taken by a French cruizer, and
they came into the possession of Thevet, the king's geographer, who
having travelled himself into the New World, and described one of
its provinces, was a curious observer of whatever tended to illustrate
the manners of the Americans. On his death, they were purchased by
Hakluyt, at that time chaplain of the Englifl ambalfador to the
French court; and, being left by him to Purchas, were publiffled at
the desire of the learned antiquary Sir Henry Spelman. Purchas, ii.
o165.

THE second specimen of Mexican pi&ure-writing, was published by
Dr. Francis Gemelli Carreri, in two copper-plates. The first is a map,

9 or
480

or rcprefentation of the progress of the ancient Mexicans on their fiftr
arrival in the country, and of the various flations in which they fttled,
before they founded the capital of their empire in the lake of Mexico.
The second, is a Chronological Wheel, or'Circle, representing the man-
ner in which they computed and marked their cycle of fifty-two years.
The former was given to him by Dr. Chrilloval de Guadalajora, in
the city of Los Angeles; the latter he received from Don Carlos de
Siguenza y Gongorra. But as ic seems now to be a received opinion
(founded I know not on what evidence) that Carreri was never out of
Italy, and that his famous Giro del Mundo, is an account of a ficitious
voyage, I have noc mentioned these paintings in the text. They
have, however, mnanifeffly the appearance of being Mexican produc-
tions, and are allowed to be so by Boturini, who was well qua-
lified to determine whether they were genuine or fuppofittious. The
tyle of painting in the former is considerably more perfet, than
any other specimen of Mexican design; but as the original is said to have
been much defaced by time, I fufpc& that it has been improved by
some touches from the hand of an European artilt. Carerri, Churchil,
iv. p. 487. The chronological wheel is ajufft delineation of the Mexi-
can mode of computing time, as described by Acofta, lib. vi. c. 2. It
seems to resemble one which that learned Jesuit had seen; and if it be
admitted as a genuine monument, it proves, that the Mexicans had nrti-
ficial, or arbitrary characters, which reprelented several things betides
numbers. Each month is there reprelented by a lfynmbol expressive of
some work or rite peculiar to it.

THE third specimen of Mexican painting was discovered by another

Italian. In 1736, Lorenzo Iloturini Becnaduci fct out for New Spain,
and was led by lIeveral incidents to tudy the language of the Mexicans,
and to collecL the remains of their hillorical monuments. He perfllt-
ed nine years in his rcfearches, with the enthufiafrn of a projecor, and
the patience of an antiquary. In 1746, he publiflied at NlMdlride, dca
de 1ula Nueva IliJloria General de la America Septentrional, containing an
account of the result of his inquiries; and he added to it a catalogue of

VOL. 11. 3 Q hi~

his American Historical Museum, arranged under thirty-fix different
heads. His ideaof a New History appears to me the work of a whim-
fical credulous man. But his catalogue of Mexican maps, paintings,
tribute-rolls, calendars, &c. is amazing. Unfortunately a ship, in
which he had ent a considerable part of them to Europe, was taken
by an English privateer in, the war before last; and it is probable that
they perished by falling into the hands of ignorant captors. Boturini
himself incurred the displeasure of theSpanifh court, and died in an
hospital at Madrid. The hiftr)ry, of which the Idea, &c. was only a
profpeus, was never publihed. The remainder of his Museum seems to
have been dispersed. Some part of it came into the poffeflion of the pre-
sent archbishop of Toledo, when he was primate of New Spain, and he
publisied from it that curious, tribute-roll which I have mentioned.

THE only other collecion of Mexican paintings, as far asI can learn;

is in the Imperial Library at Vienna. By order of their Imperial Ma-
jelfies, I have obtained such a specimen of these as I desired, in eight
paintings, made with such fidelity, that I am informed the copies could
hardly be diftinguihed from the originals. According to a note in this
Codex. Mexicanus, it appears to have been a present from Emmanuel
King of Portugal to Pope Clement VII. who died A. D. 1533. As-
ter paging through the hands of several illufbrious proprietors, it fell
into those of the cardinal of Saxe-Eifenach, who presented it to the em-
peror Leopold. These paintings, are manifestly Mexican, but they
are in a flyle very different from any of the former. An engraving
has been made of one of them, in order to gratify such of my rea-
ders, as may deem this an object worthy of their attention. Were
it an object of sufficient importance, it might be possible, with ome
attention, by recourse to the plates of Purchas, and the archbishop of
Toledo, as a key, to form plausible conjectures concerning the mean-
ing of this picure. Many of the figures are manifestly similar. A. A.
are targets and darts, almost in the fame form with those published by
Purchas, p. 1070, 1071, &c. B.B. are figures of temples, nearly
refenbling those which occur in Purchas, p. 0og and i 13, and in

I I should suppose this piEture to be a tribute-roll, as their

mode of noting numbers occurs frequently. D.D.D. &c. Accord-
ing to Boturini, the mode of computation by the number of knots,
was known to the Mexicans as well as to the Peruvians, p. 85, and the
manner in which the number of units is represented in the Mexican
paintings in my possession, seems to confirm this opinion. They plainly
resemble a firing of knots on a cord or rope.

THOSE testimonies derive great credit from one circumfiance, that

they were not given in support of any particular fylfem or theory,
but as simple answers to queries which I had proposed. It is pro-
bable, however, that when there gentlemen assert no ruins or
monuments of any ancient work whatever are now to be discovered
in the Mexican Empire, they meant that there were no such ruins
or monuments, as conveyed any idea of grandeur or magnificence,

at Mexico, mentions some ruins which are flill visible in several of
the towns, through which Cortes pafled in his way to the capital, p.
4. &c. But neither of these authors give any description of them,,
and they seem to be so very inconsiderable, as to hew only that ftme
buildings had once been there. The large mount of earth at Cholula,
which the Spaniards dignified with the name of temple, still remains,
but without any steps by which to ascend, or any facing of flone. It
appears now like a natural mount, covered with grass and flirubs,
and possibly it was never any thing more. Torquem. lib. iii. c. 19.
I have received a minute description of the remains of a temple near
Cuernavaca, on the road from Mexico to Acapulco. It is compotld of
large stones, fitted to each other as nicely as those in the buildings of
the Peruvians, which are hereafter mentioned. At the foundation it
forms a quare of 25 yards; but as it rifes in height, it diminishes in ex,

T -I E exaggeration of the Spanish Historians, with refpeca:

to the number of human victims sacrificed in Mexico, appears

to be very great. According to Gomara, there was no year in which
twenty thousand human vitims were not offered to the Mexican Di-
vinities, and in some years they amounted to fifty thousand. Cron,
c. 229. The flkulls of those unhappy persons were ranged in order
in a building ereced for that purpose, and two of Cortes's officers who.
had counted them, informed Gomara that their number was a hun-

dred and thirty fix thousand. Ibid. c. 82. Herrera's account is still
more incredible, that the number of victims was so great, that five
thousand have been facrnficed in one day, nay on ome occasions, no
less than twenty thousand. Dec. iii. lib. ii. c. 16. Torquenlada goes
beyond both in extravagance for he asserts that twenty thousand chil-
dren, exclusive of other victims, were slaughtered annually. Mon.
Ind. lib. vii. c. 21. The most refpetable authority in favour of such
high numbers is that of Zumurraga, the first bishop of Mexico,
who, in a letter to the chapter general of his order, A. D. 1631,
asserts that the Mexicans sacrificed annually twenty thousand vi&ims.

delas Casas oblerves that if there had been such an annual waste of the
human species the country could never have arrived at that degree of
populoulnes, for which it was remarkable when the Spaniards first
landed there; and he positively aerts, that the Mexicans never a-
crificed more than fifty or a hundred persons in a year. See his dif-
pute with Sepulveda, subjoined to his Breviffima Relacion, p. 105.
Cortes does not specify what number of victims was sacrificed annu-
ally, but B. Diaz del Castillo relates that an inquiry having been
made, with refpe&t to this, by the Franciscan Monks, who were lent
into New Spain immediately after the conquest, it was found that
about two thousand five hundred were sacrificed every year in Mexico.

J T is hardly neceflary to observe, that the Peruvian Chronology is

not only obscure, but repugnant to conclusions deduced from the

most accurate, and extensive observations, concerning the time that
clapses during each reign, in any given fucceflion of princes. The
medium has been found not to exceed twenty years. According to
Acofta and Garcilaflb de la Vega, I-uana Capac, who died about tli
year 1527, was the twelfth Inca. The duration of the l'eruvian mo-
narchy ought not to have been reckoned above two hundred and furty
years; but they affirm that t had subsisted four hundred years.

ihe antient Peruvian fortifications, which were likewile works of
great extent and solidity. Tom. i. 391, Three circumstances struck
all those observers: the vast size of the stones which the Peruvians
employed in some of their buildings. Acofta measured one, which
was thirty feet long, eighteen broad, and fix in thickness; and yet,
he adds, that in the fortress at Cuzco, there were stones considerably
larger. It is difficult to conceive how the Peruvians could move
there, and raise them to the height even of twelve feet. The second
circumstance is, the imperfeation of the Peruvian art, when applied
to working in timber. By the patience and perseverance natural to
Americans, stones may be formed into any shape, merely by rubbing
one against another, or by the use of hatchets or other instruments
made of stone ; but with such rude tools, little progress can be made
in carpentry. The Peruvians could not mortize two beams together,
or give any degree of union, or flability to any work compoed ot
timber. As they could not form a centre, they were totally unac-
quainted with the use of arches in building, nor can the Spanish au-
thors conceive how they were able to frame a roof for those ample
ftruRures which they raised.

TH E third circumstance is a firiking proof, which all the monuments

of the Peruvians furnish, of their want of ingenuity and invention, ac-
companied with patience no less astonishing. None of the stones em-
ployed in those works were formed into any particular or uniform
shape, that might render them fit for building. The Indians took
them as they fell from the mountains, or were raised out of the quar-

ries.

ries. Some were square, ome triangular, ome convex-, ome con-
cave. Their art and industry were employed in joining them to-
gether, by forming such hollows in the one, as perfectly corresponded
to the projections or risings in the other. This tedious operation
which might have been so easily abridged, by adapting the surface
of the stones to each other, either by rubbing, or by their hatchets
of copper, would be deemed incredible, if it were not put beyond
doubt by inspecting the remains of those buildings. It gives them a
very singular appearance to an European eye. There is no regular
layer or firatum of building, and no one stone resembles another in
dimensions or form. At the fame time, by the persevering, but ill-
dire&ed industry of the Indians, all are joined with that minute
nicety which I have mentioned. Ulloa made this observation con-
cerning the form of the stones in the fortress f Atun-Canar. Voy.

p Torribio de Benevente, or Motolinea, has enumerated ten causes

of the rapid depopulation of Mexico, to which he gives the name

of the ten plagues. Many of these are not peculiar to that province.
I. The introduction of the Iinall-pox. This dileafe was firfl: brought into
New Spain in the year 1520, by a negroc lave, who attended Narvaez.
Torribio affirms, that one half of the people, in the provinces visited
with this distemper, died. To this mortality occasioned by the small-
pox, Torquemada adds the defruaive effecs of two contagious dif-
tempers which raged in the years 1545 and 1576. In the former
800,000; in the latter, above two millions periiled, according to an
exat account taken by order of the viceroys. Mon. Ind. i. 642. The
small-pox were not introduced into Peru for fveral years after the in-
vafion of the Spaniards, but proved very fatal to the natives. Garcia
Origen, p. 88. 2. The numbers who were killed, or died of famine
in their war with the Spaniards, particularly during the siege of Mexi-
co. 3. The great famine that followed after the reduaion of Mexico,
as all the people engaged, either on one fide or other, had neglected
the cultivation of their lands. Something similar to this happened in
all the other countries conquered by the Spaniards. 4. The grievous
talks imposed by the Spaniards upon the people belonging to their
tepartimientos. 5. The opprenive burden of taxes which they were un-
able to pay, andi from which they could hope for no exemption. 6. The
numbers employed in collecting the gold, carried down by the torrents
from tie mountains, who were forced from their own habitations,
without any provilion made for their fublifence, and lfubljc:ed to all
the rigour of cold inll thlol elevated regions. 7. The immenle labour

., R :;. of

of rebuilding Mexico, which Cortes urged on with such precipitate
ardour, as destroyed an incredible number of people. 8. The num-
ber of people condemned to servitude, under various pretexts, and
employed in working the silver mines. These, marked by each pro-
prietor with a hot iron, like his cattle, were driven in herds to the
mountains. The nature of the labour to which they were fubjeted
there, the noxious vapours of the mines, the coldncfs of the climate,
and scarcity of food were so fatal, that Torribio affirms, the country
round several of those mines, particularly near Guaxago, was covered
with dead bodies, the air corrupted with their stench, and so many
vultures, and other voracious birds, hovered about for their prey, that
the fun was darkened with their flight. io. The Spaniards, in the dif-
ferent expeditions which they undertook, and by the civil wars which
they carried on, destroyed many of the natives, whom they compelled
to serve them as famenes, or carriers of burdens. This last mode of op-
preflion was particularly ruinous to the Peruvians. From the number
of Indians who perished in Gonzalo Pizarro's expedition into the coun-
tries to the east of the Andes, one may form some idea of what they
suffered, and how fast they wafted. Torribio, MS. Corita in his
Breve y Summaria Relacion, illustrates and confirms several of Torri-
bio's observations, to which he refers. MS. penes me.

1 N the seventh itle of the first book of the Rccopilacion, which con-

upon them, as guardians of the Indians, and points out the various me-
thods in which it is their duty to interpose, in order to defend them
from opprefion, either with respect to their person or property. Not
only do the laws commit to them this honourable and humane office,
but they actually exercise it.

authors. But I rather refer to Gage, as he was not disposed to,
ascribe any merit to the popifi clergy, to which they were not fully

I T is very difficult to obtain an accurate account of the state of po-

pulation in those kingdoms of Europe where the police is most per-

sec, and where science has made the greatest progress. In Spanifl
America, where knowledge is still in its infancy, and few men have
leisure to engage in researches merely speculative, little attention has
been paid to this curious inquiry. But in the year 1741, Philip V.
enjoined the viceroys and governors of the several provinces in Ame-
rica, to make an actual survey of the people under theirjurifdiction,
and to transmit a report concerning their number and occupations.
In consequence of this order, the Conde de Fuen-Clara, viceroy of
New Spain, appointed D. Jos. Antonio de Villa-Segnor y Sanchez, to
execute that commiflion in New Spain. From the reports of the ma-
giftrates in the several diftrics, as well as from his own observations,
and long acquaintance with mot of the provinces, Villa Segnor pub-
lilhed the result of his inquiries in his Theatro Americana. His report,
however, is imperfe. Of the nine dioceses, into which the Mexican
empire has been divided, he has published an account only of five,
viz, the archbishopric of Mexico, the bishoprics of Los Angeles,
Mechoacan, Oaxaca, and Nova Galicia. The bishoprics of Yucu-
tan, Verapaz, Chiapa, and Guatimala, are entirely omitted, though
the two latter comprehend countries, in which the Indian race is more
numerous than in any part of New Spain. In his survey of the exten-
five lioccfe of Nova Galicia, the lituation of the different Indian vil-
lages is described, but he specifies the number of people only in a
filall part of it. The Indians of that vail province, in which the

Spanili
494

Spanish dominion is imperfectly eflablifhed, are not registered with
the fame accuracy as in other parts of New Spain. According to
Villa Segnor, the aual state of population in the five dioceses above
mentioned is of Spaniards, negroes, mulattoes, and meilizos, in

AT the rate of five to a family, the total number is 1,471,955. We

which the tribute paid by them is collected. As fourdiocefes of ine

reside there, without specifying .their number. If,. therefore, we
make allowance. for ;these, and all who reside in the four. dioceses omit-
ted, the number-of Spaniards, and of those of a -mixed.race, may
probably amount to a million and a half. In some places, Villa
Segnor diftinguihes between Spaniards and the three inferior races of
negroes, Mulattos, aud Mestizos, and marks their numbers separate-
ly. But he generally blends them together. But from the propor-
tion observable in those places, where the number of each is marked,
as well as from the account of the state of population in New Spain
by other authors, it is manifest that the number of negroes and per-
sons of a mixed race far exceeds that of the Spaniards. Perhaps the
latter ought not to be reckoned above 500,000 to a million of the for-
mer.

DEFECTIVE as this account may be, I have not been able to pro-

cure such intelligence concerning the number of people in Peru, as
might enable me to form any conjeaure equally sa'tisfying with refpea
to the degree of its population. I have been informed, that in the
year 761, the protector of the Indians in the vice-royalty of Peru
computed that 612,780 paid tribute to the king. As,all females, and
persons under age, are exempted from this tax in Peru, the total
number.of Indians ought, -by that account, to be 2,449,120. MS.
penes me.

I s ALL'mention another mode, by whichone may compute, or at least

form a guess concerning the state of population in New Spain and Peru.
According to an account which 1 have eafon to confider as accurate,
the number of copies of the bull of Oruzada, exported to Peru on
each new publication, is I,171,953; to New Spain a,649,326. I am
informed, that but few Indians purchase bulls, and that they are fold
chiefly to the Spanish inhabitants, and those of mixed race, so that
the number of Spaniards, and people of a mixed race, will amount by
this mode of computation at least to three millions.

TiE

THE number of inhabitants in many of the towns in Spanish Ame-

rica, may give us some idea of the extent of population, and correct
the inaccurate, but popular notion entertained in Great Britain., con-
cerning the weak and desolate ilate of their colonies. The city of
Mexico contains at least 150,000 people. Los Angeles contains above
60,000 Spaniards, and people of a mixed race. Villa Segnor, p. 247.
Guadalaxara contains above 30,000, exclusive 'of Indians. Id. ii, 206.
Lima contains 54,000. D. Cofme Bueno Defcr. de Peru, 1764. Car-
thagena contains 25,000. Potofi contains 25,000. Bueno, 1767.
Popayan contains above 20,000. Ulloa, i. 287. Towns ofa second class
are ill more numerous. The cities in the most thriving settlements
of other European nations in America cannot be compared with thee.

THESE are such detached accounts of the number of people in fe-

veral towns, as I found scattered in authors whom I thought worthy
of credit. But I have obtained an enumeration of the inhabitants of
the towns in the province of Quito, on the accuracy of which I can re-
ly; and I communicate it to the Public, both to gratify curiosity, and
to recify the miltaken notion which I have mentioned. St. Francisco
de Quito contains between 50 and 60,000 people of all the different
races. Besides the city, there are in the Corregimicnto 29 curacies cfla-
blifhed in the principal villages, each of which has fialler hamlets
depending upon it. The inhabitants of there are mofily Indians and
Mestizos. St. Juan de Pasto has between 6 and 8000 inhabitants,
besides 27 dependent villages. St. Miguel de Ibarra 7000 citizens,
and ten villages. The diflrid of Havala between 18 and 20,000
people. The diftric of Tacunna between o and 12,000. The
diftric of Ambato between 8 and o,oo, betides 6 depending
villages. The city of Riobamba between 6 and 20,000 inhabitants,
and 9 depending villages. The diltrict of Chimbo between 6 and
8oco. The city of Guaquil from 16 to 20,000 inhabitants, and 14
depending villages. The clifrid of Atuafi between 5 anld oo00, and

inhabitants, and 9 populous depending villages. The town of Laxa
from 8 to lo,ooo inhabitants, and 14 depending villages. This de-
gree of population, though slender, if we confider the vast extent of
the country, is far beyond what is commonly supposed. I have
omitted to mention, in its proper place, that Quito is the only pro-
vince in Spanish America that can be denominated a manufacturing
country; hats, cotton fluffs, and coarse woollen cloths, are made
there in such quantities, as to be sufficient not only for the confump-
tion of the province, but to furnifl a considerable article for exporta-
tion into other parts of Spanilh America. I know not whether the
uncommon industry of this province should be confidered as the cause
or effect of its populousness. But among the ostentatious inhabitants
'of the New World, the paflion for every thing that comes from Eu-
rope is so violent, that I am told the manufactures of Quito are to:
much undervalued, as to be on the decline.

D Ant. Ulloa contends, that working in the mines is not noxious,

and as a proof of this informs us, that many Mestizos and In-

dians, who do not belong to any Repartimiento, voluntarily hire them-
selves as miners ; and several of the Indians, when the legal term of
their service expires, continue to work in the mines of choice. Etre-
ten. p. 265. But his opinion concerning the wholesomeness of
this occupation is contrary to the experience of all ages; and
wherever men are allured by high wages, they will engage in any
species of labour, however fatiguing or pernicious it may be. D. Hern,
Carillo Altemirano relates a curious fat incompatible with this opi-
nion. Wherever mines are wrought, fays he, the number of Indians
decreases; but in the provinces of Campeachy, where there are no
mines, the number of Indians has increased more than a third since the
conquest of America, though neither the foil nor climate be so favour-
able as in Peru or Mexico. Colbert. ColleCt. In another memorial:
presented to Philip III. in the year 609, Captain Juan Gonzalez de
Azevedo asserts, that in every diftriEt of Peru, where the Indians are

HE itrongeft proof of this may be deduced from the laws
themselves. By the multitude and variety of regulations to pre-

vent abuses, we may form an idea of their number. Though the
laws have, wifely, provided that no Indian flall be obliged o serve
in any mine at a greater distance from his place of residence than
thirty miles; we are informed in a memorial of D. Hernan Carillo
Altamirano presented to the king, that the Indians of Peru are often
compelled to serve in mines at the diflance of a hundred, a hundred
:and fifty, and even two hundred leagues from their habitation. Col-
'bert Collect. Many mines are situated in parts of the country, o
barren, and so distant from the ordinary habitations of the Indians,
that the neceffiry of procuring labourers to work there, has obliged
the Spanifl monarchs to difpenfl with their own regulations in several
instances, and to permit the viceroys to compel the people of more
remote provinces to resort to those mines. Elcalona Gazophyl.

that they have been fludious to alleviate this opprelion as much as
possible, by enjoining the viceroys to employ every method, in order
to induce the Indians to fettle in tome part of the country adjacent to
the mines. Id. ibid.

T HIS description of the manners of the Spanifl clergy, I fiould not

have ventured to give, upon the tflimony of protestant authors

alone, as they may be fufpested of prejudice or exaggeration. Gage,
in particular, who had a better opportunity than any protestant, to
view the interior slate of Spanish America; describes the corruption
of the church, which he had forsaken, with so much of the acrimony
of a new convert, that I should have diftruftled his evidence, though
it communicates some very curious and striking saCs. But Benzoni
mentions the profligacy of ecclesiastics in America at a very early pe-
riod after their settlement there. Hist. lib. ii. c. 19, 20. M. Frezier,
an intelligent obfervcr, and zealous for his own religion, paints the
dissolute manners of the Spanish ecclesiastics in Peru, particul.trly
the regulars, in stronger colours than I have employed. Voy. p. 5.
215, &c. M. Gentil confirms this account. Voy. i. 34. Correal
concurs with both, and adds many remarkable circumstances. Voy.
i. 61. 155. 161. I have good reason to believe, that the manners of the
regular clergy, particularly in Peru, are fill extremely indecent.
Acofta himself acknowledges that great corruption of man-
ners had been the consequence of permitting monks to forsake

4 the

the retirement and discipline of the cloister, and to mingle again
with the world, by undertaking the charge of the Indian pa-
rilfes. De procur. Ind. Salute, lib. iv. c. 13, &c. He mentions par-
ticularly thore vices, of which I have taken notice, and confiders the
temptations to them as so formidable, that he leans to the opinion
of those wlio hold that the regular clergy flould not be employed
as parilh priefls. Lib. v. c. 20. Even the advocates for the regulars
admit, that many and great enormities abounded among the monks
of differcnt orders, when set siee from the refriaint of monaflic dif-
cipline; and from the tone of their defence, one may conclude that
tle charge brought against them was not deflitute of truth. In the
French colonies, the state of the regular clergy is nearly tlhe ftme as
in the Spanifil settlements, and the fame conlequences have followed.
M. Biet, fulperior of tle fccul.r pIlicets in Cayenne, inqcuires with
no le's piety than candour, into the cautlcs of this corruption, and
imputes it chiefly to the exemption of regulars from the jurifdicion
and censures of their diocesans ; to tle temptations to which they are
exposed; and to their engaging in commerce. Voy. . 320. It is re-
markable that all the authors, who censure the liccntioufnefs of the
Spanifi regulars with greatest severity, concur in vindicating the
conduce of the Jcfuits. Formed under a dilcipline more perfect than
that of the other monastic orders, or animated by that concern for
the honour of the society, which takes ficlh full ponfllion of every
member, the Jceuits, both in Mexico and Peru, it is allowed, have
maintained a mofl irreproachable decency of manners. Frezler, 223.

0 T only the native Indians, but the Mestizos, or children of
a Spaniard and Indian, were originally excluded from the priest-

hood, and refutfed admission into any religious order. But by a law
iflued Sept. 28th, 1588, Philip II. required the prelates of America
to ordain such metlizos born in lawful wedlock, as they should find
to be properly qualified, and to permit them to take the vows in any
monastery where they had gone through a regular noviciate. Recopil.

observation of it, and profcfling his dcfire to have all his fubjcsts

of the fame privileges. Such, however, was the avcrfion of the Spa-

niards in America to the Indians, and their race, that this seems to
have produced little effet; for, in the year 1725, Philip V. was
obliged to renew the injunction in a more peremptory tone. But so
unsurmountable are the hatred and contempt of the Indians among the
Peruvian Spaniards, that the present king has been constrained to en-
force the former edics anew by a law, published September , 1774.

Z T ARIZ, an accurate and cautious calculator, seems to ad-
mit, that the quantity of silver that does not pay duty may be

flated thus high. According to Herrera, there was not above a third
of what was extracted from Potofi that paid the king's fifth. Dec. viii.
lib. ii. c. 15. Solorzano asserts likewise, that the quantity of silver
which is fraudulently circulated, is far greater than that which is re-

W H E N the mines of Potofi were discovered in the year r545, the

veins were so near the surface, that the ore was easily extracted, and

so rich, that it was refined with little trouble, and at small expence, merely
by the acion of fire. This simple mode of refining by fusion alone con-
tinued until the year 1574, when the use of mercury in refining silver,
as well as gold, was discovered. Those mines having been wrought
without interruption for two centuries, the veins are now funk so deep,
that the expence of extracting the ore is greatly increased. Besides
this, the richness of the ore, contrary to what happens in most other
mines, has become less as the vein continued to dip, ad has diminifl-
ed to such a degree, that one is amazed that the Spaniards should per-

sift in working it. Other rich mines have been successively discovered,
but in general the value of the ores has decreased so much, while the
expence of extracting them has augmented, that the court of Spain,
in the year 1736, reduced the duty payable to the king from afifth to
a tenth. All the quicksilver used in Peru, is extracted from the famous
mine of Guanacabelica, discovered in the year 1563. The crown has re-
served the property of this mine to itself; and the persons who purchased
the quicksilver, paid not only the price of it, but likewise afifth, as a
duty to the king. But, in the year 761, this duty on quicksilver was
abolished, on account of the increase of expence in working mines.

M AN Y remarkable proofs occur of the advanced slate of industry

in Spain, at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The number

of cities in Spain was coniderable, and they were peopled far beyond
the proportion that was common in other parts of Europe. The caufxs
of this I have explained, Hist. of Cha. V. i. 158. Wherever cities are

trade in giving acRivity to these is manifest, from a singular sac. In
the 1545, while Spain continued to depend on its own indultry, for the
supply of its colonies, so much work was bespoke from the manufac-
turers, that it was supposed they could hardly finish it in less than fix
years. Campom. i. 406. Such a demand must have put much in-
dufry in motion, and have excited extraordinary efforts. Accord-
ingly, we are informed, that in the beginning of Philip II's reign,
the city of Seville alone, where the trade with America centered, gave
employment to no fewer than 6,ooo looms in silk or woollen work,
and that above 130,000 persons had occupation in carrying on there
manufactures. Campom. ii. 472. But so rapid and pernicious was
the operation of the causes which I shall enumerate, that before
Philip III. ended his reign, the looms in Seville were reduced to 40o.

rTHE account of the mode in which the fa&ors of the South Sea

Company conducted the trade in the fair of Porto-bello, which

was opened to them by the Afliento, I have taken from Don Dion.
Alcedo y Herrera, president of the court of Audience in Quito, and
governor of that province. Great credit is due to his testimony, as
he was an eye-witness of the transactions which he relates, and often
employed in detecting and authenticating the frauds which he describes.
It is probable, however, that his representation being composed at the
commencement of the war which broke out between Great Britain and
Spain, in the year 1739, may, in ome instances, be exaggerated. His
detail of fats is curious; and even English authors confirm it in soma
degree, by admitting both that various frauds were praftifed in the tranf-
aftions of the annual hip, and that the contraband trade from Jamaica,
and other British colonies, was become enormously great. But for the
credit of the English nation it may be observed, that those fraudulent
operations are not to be confidered as deeds of the company, but as
the dishonourable arts of their factors and agents. The Company it-
self fulfained a considerable loss by the Affiento trade. Many of its
servants acquired immense fortunes. Anderson. Chronol. deduct.

hundred miles along the coast, and is one of the most fertile inAmerica;
it was to much negleted by the Spaniards, that during the twenty years

Spain to that province and during sixteen years, from 1706 to 1722,
not a fi.igle flip arrived from the Caraccas in Spain, Noticias de Real

it consumes, by foreigners. Before the erection of the company,
neither tobacco nor hides were imported from Caraccas into Spain.
Id. p. 17. But since the commercial operations of the company be-
gan in the year 173 1, the importation of cacao into Spain, has increaf-
ed amazingly. During thirty years subsequent to 1701, the number of
.anegas of cacao (each a hundred and ten pounds) imported from Ca-
raccas, was 643,215. During eighteen years subsequent to 173 r, the
number of Fanegas imported was 869,247 ; and if we suppose the im-
portation to be continued in the fame proportion during the remainder
of thirty years, it will amount to ,448,746 ];anegas, which is an
increase of 805,531 2anegas. Id. p. 148. During ight years fubfe-

remits to Spain, or lays out in purchasing European goods. But, be-
fides this, the most explicit evidence is produced, that the quantity of
cacao raised in the province is double to what it yielded in 1731 ; the

augmented. The revenue of the biflop, which arises wholly from

T H E price paid for the bull varies according to tie rank of dif-

ferent persons. Thdfe in the lowest order, who are servants or

Raves, pay two reals of plate, or one hilling ; other Spaniards pay
eight reals, and those in public office, or who hold encomiendas, fix-
teen reals. Solorz. dejure Ind. vol. ii. lib. iii. c. 25. According to
Chilcon, an English merchant who resided long in the Spanish fettle-
mients, the bull of Cruzado bore an higher price in the year 1570, be-
ing then fold for four reals at the lowefl. Hakluyt, iii. 461. The
price seems to have varied at different periods. That exaced for the

AS Villa Segnor, to whom we are indebted for this information,

was accomptant-general in one of the most considerable depart-

ments of the royal revenue, and by that means had access to proper
information, his testimony with respect to this point merits great crc-
dir. No such accurate detail of the Spanifi revenues in any part of
America, has hitherto been publishcd in the English language, and
the particulars of it may appear curious and interefling to Ibme of Imy
readers.

THIS fum amounts to 819,6I 1. Sterling, and if we add to it the

profit accruing from the sale of 5ooo quintals of quicksilver, im-
Iportcd fiom the mines of Almaden, in Spain, on the king's ac-
count, and what accrues from the A.veria, and some other taxes
which Villa Segnor does not estimate, may well be reckoned above a
million pounds sterling money. Theat. Mex. vol. i. p. 38, &c. Ac-
cording to Villa Segnor, the total produce of the Mexican mines,
amounts at a medium to eight millions of pesos in silver annually,
and to 5912 marks of gold. Ib. p. 44. Several branches of the re-
venue have been explained in the course of the history; ome, which
there was no occasion of mentioning, require a particular illustration.
The right to the tylhes in the New World, is vested in the crown of
.Spain, by a bull of Alexander VI. Charles V. appointed them to be
applied in the following manner. One-fourth is allotted to the bishop
of the diocese, another fourth to the dean and chapter, and other
officers of the cathedral. The remaining half is divided into nine equal
parts. Two of these, under the denomination of los dos Novenos reales,
are paid to the crown, and constitute a branch of the royal revenue.
The other seven parts are applied to the maintainance of the parochial
clergy, the building and support of churches, and other pious uses.

I rAVE not been able to procure any accurate detail of the several

branches of revenue in Peru, later than the year 1614. From a curi-
ous manuscript, containing a slate of that vice-royalty in all its depart-
ments, presented to the Marquis of Montes-Claros, by Fran. Lopez
Caravantes, accomprant-general in the tribunal of Lima, it appears,
that the public revenue, as nearly as I can compute the value of the
money in which Caravantes states his accounts, that the revenue col-
leCted, amounted in ducats, at 4s. l d., to - 2,372,768

Expences of government - - 1,242,992

Net free revenue I,I29,776

The total in ferling money - ,. 583,303
Expences of government - 305,568

Net free revenue 277,735

BUT several articles appear to be omitted in this computation, such

as the duty on Itamped paper, leather, ecclesiastical annats, &c. so
that the revenue of Peru may be well supposed equal to that of
Mexico.

IN computing the expence of government in New Spain, I may

take that of Peru as a Itandard. There the annual cftablifiment for
defraying the charge of administration, exceeds one half of the re-
venue collelced, and there is no reason for supposing it to be less in
New Spain.

I HAVE obtained a calculation of the total amount of the public
revenue of Spain from America and the Philippines, which, as the

bitant, and so little corresponding with all accounts of the annual im-
portation from America, that the imformation on which it is founded
muff evidently be erroneous. According to Campomanes, the total
product of the American mines may be computed at thirty millions
of pesos, which, at four ifillings and fix pence a peso, amounts to
7,425,0001. ferling, the king's fifth of which (if that were regularly
paid) would be ,4.5,oool. But from this um the expence of admi-
niftration is to be deducted, which is very considerable as appears from

SHORT ACCOUNT

0 F
What is contained in the LETTER sent to the

EMPEROR, mentioned Preface, p. xi.

HIS letter is dated July 6th, 1519. Cortes in his
cfcond dispatch takes notice that it was fcnt off on the
16th of July.

THE great object of the persons who wrote this letter, is to

juflify their own conduct in efablifhing a colony independent
on the jurifdiaion of Vclafquez. With this view they en-
dcavour to detracd from his merit, in fitting out the two
former armaments under Cordova and Grijalva, representing
thcfc as equipped by the adventurers who engaged in the ex-
pedition, not by the governor. They labour likewise to depre-
ciate the services of Cordova and Grijalva, in order to exalt the
incit of their own exploits.

tI l:v contend, that thle folc ojcet (EfVclafqlucz was to

trade or liarltcr swi thle natives, not to attempt the con(lueRt
of New 'p;iin, or the clalblillnmcnl of a colony there. This is
friceq(ently mncnitiocd by 1. Diaz del Caflillo, c. !). 41, 12,

VoL. lI.

TII.Y assert, that Cortes defrayed the greatest part of the ex-

pence of fitting out the armament. But this does not agree
with the account of his slender fortune given by Gomara,
Cron. c 7. and B. Diaz, c. 20, or what I have mentioned
Note iii, vol. ii.

THEY take notice, that though considerable numbers were

wounded in their different encounters with the people of Ta-
bafco, not one of them died, and all recovered in a short time.
This seems to confirm what I have observed vol. ii. p. 39, con-
cerning the imperfeaion of the offensive weapons of the
Americans.

THEY give tome account of the manners and institutions of

the Mexicans. It is very short, and as they had resided but a
short time in the country, and had but little intercourse with
the natives, it is both defedive and inaccurate. They describe
minutely, and with great horror, the human sacrifices offered
by the Mexicans to their deities, and affirm that some of their
number were eye-witnesses of those barbarous rites.

THEY subjoin to their letter a catalogue and description of

the presents ent to the emperor. That published by Gomara,
Cron. c. 29. seems to have been copied from it, and Pet.
Martyr dclcribcs many of the articles in his trcatife De Infulis
nupcr inventis, p. 354, &c.
