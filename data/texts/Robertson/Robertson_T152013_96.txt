family , and more jealous ·of his- authority, as he
advanced' in years. Pu~shed on by therfe pas-

But finding that Mlonarch, notwithffanding his-·
hereditary enmnity to Charles ,. and dread of his
growYing p~ower , as unwilling as formerly to
involve himself in immediate hostilities, he was
obliged to contrarf his views , and to think of
preventing future en'croachments, since it was
not in hlis power to inflid vengeance an account
of those which were past~. For this purpose,
he determnined to -recall his grant of Parma and
Placentia, ·and aifter declaring them to be re-

Sannexed to the Holy See, to indemnify his

gSrandlfon OPAavio by. a new eftablifhmelit in the
ecclesiastical Rtate. By this expedient , he hoped
to gain two points of no fmnall consequence.
He, firlt of all, rendered his psffeflion of Pare
ma morec frecure; as the Emperor would be cau.z
tious of invading the patrimony of the church,
though he might. seize without scruple a town bei
longing to the hou~se of FarnefCe. In the next place,
he would acquire a better chance of recov~ering
Placentia , - as his folicitati~ons to that e~ffed
m1ighlt descently be urged with greater importuz-
Onity, and wouki infallibly. be attended with

as pleading the caufre of his own family , but Is 49.
as an advocate .for the interest of the church.
But w~hile Paul was priding hindr-elf in this deg
vice, as a happy refinement in policy, Oc~avio,
an ambitious and hig~h-fpirited ,lyoung man ,who
could not bear with patience to be fTpoiled of
one half of his territories~ byr the rapacioufnels
of his father-in-law~, and to be deprived of the
other by the artifices of his grandfather , took
measure~s in order to prevent the execution of
a plan fatal to his interel. ·He set out secretly-
f~rom Rome, and having firf-tl err~S~ioufd bret t
furprize Parma, which attemnp~l,~t y 'fruffrated
by the fidelity of the governor 'toi wvhom the
Po~pe had entrusted the defence of the town, he
made overtures to the Emperor, of renouncing
all connexion with the Pope, and of depending
entirely on him, for his. future fortune. T~Bhis
unexpeded defeAion of one of the Pope's own
family to an enemy whom he hated, irritated,
almost to nliadnefs, - a mind peevish wyith old
age; and there was no degree of ~severity to
wrhich Paul might not have proceeded against a
grandf~lon whom he reproached as an unnatural
apoffate. But happ'ily for Oatavio, death *pre-
vented his carry~ing into execution the har~th
resolutions which he had taken w6ith respect to
him·, and put an end to his pFontificate itx the

jt.4j. eighty-feconda of his ag~e "

SAmong m-anly instances of the credulity or weakne~ss

of hifltc~ians in attributing the death of illufkrio-us person-
ages to extraordfnary causes, this ·is one. Almost all the
historians of th'e sixteenth century affirm, that; the dteath of
Paul III. wa~s occalloned by th~e vi-olenlt: pafflons which the
beh~aviour of his grandfron excited ,that: being. Informed,
while· he was refreshing himse~lf in one of his gardens~ ~near
RomEe, of Octavio's attemp~t on Parmaa, as well as of his
negociations with the Emperor by means of Gonzaga, -he
fiainted awu~ay, cont~inued some hou~rs in ai twoon, then b'e-
camne feverith, and died within three days. This is th~e
ac~count given of it -by Thuati~s, lib. vi. 2xIr. Adri~ani
~Iftr. -de' fuaoi temnpi, lib. vii. 4·80. and by Father Paul, 280..
Even catrdinal :Pallavicini, better infb~rmed than any writer
with regard to the events which happened in the papal
court, and when not warped by prejudice or fy~item, more:
accurate in relating them, agrees 'with their narrativze in its
chief circuli't~ifces. Pallay. b. ii. 74. Paruta, who wvrote his
hiffory by command of th-e senat~e of VSTenice, relates it in
the fame manner. Hifrc ee.vol. iv. 2 x 2. But
there was no occasion to search for any extraordinary cau~se ,
to account for th~e deathl· of an old8 man of eighty -tivo.
Thiee remains an authentick accourit of this e~vent, in
which we find none of thoafe marvellous c~ir~cumfiances of
wthich the hiftcorians are so fond. Th-e cardinal of Ferrara,
wyho wa8s ent~ruffedwith the affairs of France at th~e couLrt·
of Rome, and. M. D'Urfcl, Henry's ambassador in ordinary
there, wrao~te an ~account to that MVonarch of the affair of
Parma, and of the P~ope's death. By these it appears, that
Octa~vio's attempt to fbr~lprize , .Parmla, was mad~e on the
twefitieth of Octob~er , that next day in the evening , and not
whi eq he was airing himself in thre gardens of Monte -Ca-

timsating h'is· resolution of throwihg him~self into th~e armzs~

an auf~wer to it; that on the twentycfecon-d of October th~e

whe eec· wholSe address and firmness he exalted to the
3Jnus m. papal throne the Cardinal di M~onte, whom

P9aul had employed as his principal legate in
the council of Trent, and truffed with his most
fbecret intentions. ~He ass~umed the name of
Julius III. and, in order to express his gratitude
towards his benefaator, the first ad of his ad-
rniniftration was to put O~aavio Farnese in pof~-
feffiyon of Parma. Wi8hen he was told of thie
injury which he did to the Holy See by alienat-
ing a territory of sauch value, he briskly replied,
" That he would rather be a poor: Pope, with
~the reputation of a gentleman, than a rich one,
prith the infamy of having forgotten the obli-
gations conferred upon him, and the' promises
which he had made '." But all the luffre 'of this
candour or generosity he quickly effaced by an

xi~s charac-adion most shockingly indecent. According
er ana con- to an ancient and .established pradtice , every

affonifhment of~ the sacred college , conferred
t~his mark of difitindi~on, together with ample

Such a profititition of the highest dignity in the.
church; would have given offence , even in those
dar~k periods, when the credulous s~uperstition
of the people emboldened ecclefiafticks to ven-
ture on the most; flagrant violations of decorum.
Bt3ut in an enlightened, age, when, by the pro-
~gref iof knowledge and philosophy , the obli-
g~ations of duty and decency were better under-
flood, whlen a blind veneration for the Pont~ifical
(charader was every-where abated , and one half
of Christendom in open rebellion against the
Papal See, this aation was viewed with horror.
Ro~me was immnediately filled with libels and
]pafquinades, which imputed the Pope's extrat-
vaga~nt regard for fuchi an unworthy objea to
tEhe most criminal patirons. The Protestants
exclaimed against; the absu~rdity of ffuppdogin

forbidden inquiries, as wvell as dangerous deci-
fions. H~e wished,· for these reas~ons , to have
eluded the obligation of his oath, and gave ana
ambiguous anfiver to the first propos~als which
were made to him by the Emperor, with regard
to that mnatter.: But Charle's, e~ither ~from his
natural obftiiaacy -in adhering toa the measures
which he had once adopted, or from the mere
pride of a~ccomplishing ,Ihat was held to be al-
most imy'irbilile, persisted obftcinately in his re~fo-
Jution of forcing the Protestants to return into
the bosom of the church. Hraving perfiaded
hims~elf, that the authoritative decisions of the
council: iight be employed with efficacy in com-
bating thieir prejudices, he, in consequence of
tha~t perfiuaion , continued to solicit earnestly
that a new bull of convocation might .be issued;
and the Pope could not,' with decency , reje~t

thtrequeft. Wihen Julius -found that he could

(not prevent the calling of a council, he endea·

Ics so, the ~meeting of an assembly, which was the objea:

of s~uch generMl desire and expedtation. A cont
gr·egation of Cardinals, to whomn he referred the
consideration of what was necessa~ry ~for reitoring
peace to the church,~, .recommended, by his di-
reaion., .th~e flpeedy c~onvocation of a council, as
tahe moRt effeatual ,expedient for that, purp~ose;
and as the new herefies raged with the greateRt
violence in Germanay, they proposed Trent as
the place of itis meeting, that, by a near inf~pe~iona
of the evil, the remedy might be .applied with
greater discernment and certainty of fucce'fs.
The Pope warmly approved of this advice, which
he himself had didated, and sent nuncios to the.
Imperial and French courts, in ordeir to make
known his intentions '.

·h mlet at ABoUe this time', the Emperor had summoned

cure a more authentick aat of the Empire , ac-

s~pirit of independence almong the Germans was
not - entirely s~ubdued, and for that ~reason took
care to over-awe the diet by a considerable body
of Spanish troops ·which escorted him .thither.
The first point, fbabmitted to the consideration
of the diet, was the necefirty of holding a coun-
cil. All the Poapilh members agreed, without
difficulty, that the meeting of that assembly
should be renewed at Trent, and promised an
implicit acquiescence in its decrees. The Pro-
teftants, intimidated and disunited, muff~ ha~ve
followed th~eir example, and the res~olution of
the diet would have proved unanimous, if IVMau-
rice of Saxony had not b~egun at this time to dif-

ftorwarded all his ambitious schemes, 1VIaurice Emperor.
had raised himself to the eledoral dignity ; and
having added the dominions of the elder branch-
of the Saxon family to his own, he was become
the most powerful Prince ,in Germany. But
his long and intimate umion with the Emperor,
had afforded him many opportunities of obibry-
ing narrowly the dangerous tendency of his

as 5 0 for his bountry; and from the rapid as well as

formid~able progress of the Imp-erial ipower, was
convinced that but a few st~eps more remained
to- be taken, in order to render C~harles as abfo-
lute a Mp/onarch in G~ermany as he had become
in Spain. The more eminent the condition was
to. wh~ch he hims~elf 'had been exsat~ed~, the more
~solicitous ~did he naturally become to maintain
all its rights and privileges , and the more did
he dread the thoughts of descending from th~e
ranik of a Prince almost independent, to that of
a vassal fu~bj68t to th'e will of a m-aiter. At the
fame time , he perceived that Charles was bent
on exading a rigid conformity to the doatrines
an~d r'ites of the R~imifh church, inflead of' allow~-
ing liberty of conscience, the promise of wihich·
had· allured several Protestant Princes- to afiift
him in the war against the confederates of S~mal-
kidde. A~s he himfblf, notwithstanding all the
compliances which he had made from motives
eos interest , or an excess of confideqce in the
Emperor, was sincerely attacheed to the Lutherap
t~enets, he determi~ned not to be a tame fpedtator
of the overthrow of a fyfi~em which he believed
to be founded in truth.

which in- 11berty, or zeal for rehigion, was firengthened

him.

th~at elevated Rtation, in wlhich M~aurice wyas now
placed, new and more extensive profCpea~s opened
to his view. His rank and power entitled~ hira
to be the head of the Protestants in the Empire.
His predecessor, the degraded Eledtor, with in.
ferior abilities, and territories less considerable,
had acquired fulch an ascendant over the coun-~
cilsl of the party; and Maurice neither wanted
discernment to fee the advantage of this pre-
eminence, nor ambition to aim at attaining it.
B~ut he fouznd himself in a situation which ren-
dered the ,attempt no less difficult, than the ob-
jea~ of it: was important. On the one hand, the
connexion which he hadt formed with the Em-
peror was so intimate, that he could fecarcely
hope to take any step which tended to dissolve
it, without -alarming his jealousy, and drawing
on himself the whole weight of that power, which
had cruihedl the greatest confederacy ever formed
in Germany., On .the other hand, the. calamli-
ties which he had brought on the Protestant;
party were so recent, as well as great, that it
seemed almnoft impossible to regain their confi-
dence, or to rally and -re-animate a body of men,
af~ter himfielf had been the chief infirument; in
breaking their union and vigour. Ther'e con-
fiderations were fCufficient: to have discouraged
any person of a s~pirit less adventurous than
M~aurice's. But: to him the grapdeulr and vaftners
of the enterpr~iz~e were ;tllureuents; and he boldly Boon X.

which coL COnfirming this resolution; and the resentment:

2f~atehdre. excited by an injury, which he fenrbly felt,

added new force to the motives for opposing th~e
Emperor, which found policy fuggefied. Majau-·
rice, by his authority, had prevailed on the Land-
grave of Hesse to put his person in the Empe-
ror's power , and had obtained a' promilk~ from
the Imperial minifiers that he should not be
detained a prisoner. This had been violated inp
the manner already related. T3Ihe unhappy Land-
grave exclaimed as loudly against his fon-in-lave~
as against Charles. T~Phe Princes of Hess~e re-
quired Maurice incefa~ntly· to fulfil his engage-
mnents to their father, who had loft his liberty
bjy trussing to him,; and all Germany f~ufpeted
him of havi'ng betrayed , to an implacable enemy,
the friend whom he was most bound to pr-otect.
Riout~ed by theres folicitations or reproaches, as
well as prompted by duty and afFection to his
father-in-lawY, Maaurice had empl]oyed not only
kntreaties but remonftrances in order to procure
his release. .All thes~e Charles had disr~egarded;
and the fhamne of having been fieft deceived,
andl then slighted, byl a Prince whom he had

served with zeal as wvell as fauccef~s, Yhich merited ~Booz X.
a very different return, made fulch a deep impref- Iasso,

while, on the other, fComethmng considerable and

points. As he knew Charles to be inflexible
with regard to the faubmiion wahich he rbquired
to the Interim, h~e dlid not hesitate one moment
whether he thould effablifh that form of~ doc-
trine and worship in his dominions: But being
$enfible how odious it was to his fabjedPs, inficad
of violently imapofing- it on them by the mere
terror of authority, as had been done in other
parts of Germany , he endeavioured to render
their obedience a voluntary deed of their own.
For this purpos~e , he had assembled the clergy we enforces
of his country at Leipfick , and had laid th~i te Interim'

w7hich made ~itr neceffarTy to contform to, it. ··lje

rs so. he,had wrought upon by threats, and aill were

intimidated by: the rigour with which obedience
to the Interim wa~s .extorted in the neighbouring
provinces. Even M~elandthon, whos~e merit of
everly kind entitled him to the first~ place among
the Protefiant divines, being novr deprived of
the manly couns~els of Luther, which were wont:
to inspire him with fortitude, and to preserve
him fleady amidst. the ftormns and dangers that
threatened thie church, was feducedL into unwar-
rantable concet~ions, by the timidity of his tem-
per, his fond desire of peace, and his~exceffive
complaisance towards persons of high rank. ]By
his arguments and authority, no les~s than by
IVZaurice's arts , the assembly was prevailed on t~o
declare, that, in points w~hich were purely indif-
ferent, obedience was due -to the commands of
·a lawful superior. Foundiing upon this maxim,
£10 less uncontrovkrtible in theoryi, than danger-
ou>es when carried into pradice, especially in reli-
giouas xmatters, they proceeded to class, among
the number of -things indifferent, several doc.

For that purpose, he not only rene'wed his pro-

und~ertook 10 ~redu~ce it to obedi~ence , and in-
flantly set a~bo~tattying- troops to be employed
in that f'ervice. Th~is damped all the hopes which
thei Proteltanets begain to conceiv'e of Mlaurice,
in confequenice of his declaration , and left them
more than ever -at ·a loss ·to g~uess at his real in-
tendtons. Their former fufEpicions and diffruit
of him reviv~ed, and the divines of MC'agdeburgh
filled Germanyi with writings in which they
represented him asl the most formidable enemy
o~f the JProt~eftant religion , who treacherously
assumed· air appearance of zeal for its interest ,
that he m'ight more effeaually execute his
fehetimes fo~r its -defirudtion.

re centt fats , as well· as by his present dubious

ceerlune in condua , gained foch universal credit, that
the counc~il. M~augce was obliged to take a vigorous fiep in

his own vind~ication. As soon as the re-affem-
ibling ·ofshie ·council at Trent was propos~ed in
the diet, his amnbaff~adors protefied that their
matlter would not acktrowledg~e its authority,

unless all the points wvhich had bJeen already
decided there w~ere reviewed , and considered as
entire; unless the ,PBrotefiant divines had a full.
ha;ring granted them, and were allowed, a de-
cif~i7~e voice in the council; and unless the Pope
r~enounced his pr~tenflons to preside irt the:
council, engaged to submit to its decrees, and
absolved the bishops from their oath of obe-
dience, that they might deliver their sentiments
with greater freedom. T~efe demands, which
were higher than any that the Reformers had
vientured to make, even when the zeal of their
party was warmest, or their affairs mofit ro-
~Fperous, counterbalanced, in some degree, the
impre~ion which. Maurice's preparations against
IV~lagdeburgh had made upon the minds of the
Protestants, ,and kept them in f~uipence with
regard to his designs. AClt the fa~me time, he
had address enough to re~preient this part of his
conduA in futch a. light to the Emperor, that
it gave him no offence, and occafloned no inter-
ruption of the firiaL confidenice which fulblifted2
between them. Wi7hat the pretexts were which~
he employed in order to give su~ch a bold de-
claration an innocent appearance, the contem-
porary hifftorians havle not explained ; that they
imposed upon Ch'arles is certain, for he still

r not being yet known at Augfburgh , the chief

on the city business of the diet was to enforce the 0 f'ier-·
of"agde. tatlOn of the Interim. As the fCenate of Mlag-

deburgh, notwithffanding various endeavour%
to frighten or to ~sooth them into co'mpliance,
not only perfeveredp obstinately in their oppo-
fItion to the -Interim , but began to firengthen
`the fortifications of their city, and to levy
troops in their owYn defence , Charles required
the diet to as~sist him in quelling this audacious
rebsellion against a decree OE the Empire. Had
'the members of the diet been left to adt agree-
ab~ly to their own inclination , this demand
;would have been rejeated without ,hesitation.
All the Germans who favoured , in any degree,
the new opinions in religion , and many who
wyere influenced by no other consideration than
jealousy of .the Emperot-'s growmng power, re-
·garded this effort of the citizens of M~agdeburghi,
as a noble stand for the liberties of their country.
Even faich as had not refollution to exert the
Fame f'pirit , admired tire gallantry of their enter-
pride, and wtithed it success. ]But the presence
of the Spanish troops, together with the dread
of the Empero~r's difpleatCure , over-awed the

members of the diet toj such a degree , that B~oK X,
without venturing to utter their own s~ent~i- 4 ss0.
ments , they tamely ratified, by their votes,
whatever the Emperor was pleased .to ~preferibe.
The rigorous decrees, which Charles had illbed
by his own authority against the Mdagdebuirghers,
were con~firmed; a res~olution was taken to raifb
troops in order to bef~ege the city iix form;
and persons were named to fix thegcontmngent mn
men or money to be furnifbied by each slate.
At the fame time , the diet petitioned that a~ppoinh
IVWaurice might be entruff ed with the command Mn~:auric
of tha~t army, to which Charles gave his con-
fTent with great alacrity, and with high enco-
miums uponl the wisdom of the choice which
they ~had made '. As IVlaurice condudied all
his fch~mes with profound and impenetrable
-secrecy, it is probable that he took no step
avowedly in order to obtain this charge. The
recommendation of his countrymen was either
purely accidental , or flowed from the .opinion
generally entertained of his great abilities; arnd
nleither the diet had any forpfiight, nor the Emn-
peror anly dread of the confb~quences which fol-
Towed upon this nomination. Maurice accepted
wyithout hesitation the trust committed to him ,
inflantly discerning the important advantages
which he mig-ht derive from it.

Deenbr, lifhed, and the council fu~mmonedl to meet at

Trent on the first day of the ensuing month of
IWlay. As he knew that m~any of the Germans
sejedted or disputed the authority and jurifdic~ionz
wsihich the papal fee claims with refped ..to
general councils, he took care , in the preamble
of the bull, to assert, in the firongeft terms, his

assembly, but. to diren its proceedings; nor
would he soften these expreflions,· in any~ de-
gree , in compliance with the repeated folicita-
tions of the Emperor, who foresaw what~ioffence
they would give, and what cconiruction might
be put on them. They were cedutred, accord-
ingly with great fe verity , by several members
of the diet; but whatever dif'guf1 or suspicion
they excited, such abs~olute direAion of ally their
deliberations had the Emperor acquired; that:

Feb. 13* the council was recognis~ed, and declared to be

time afflided th~e church; all the Princes and
flates' of the Empire, such as had made inno-
v~ations in religion, as well as those who adhered

to the ijyfiem of their forefathers, w~ere required
to fend their representatives to the council; the
Emperor engaged to grant a safe, conduat to

to fix his residence in s~ome. city of the Empire,
in the neighbourhood of Trent, that he might

fence, and take care that, by conduaing their
dieliberations agreeably to scripture and the

being ex~tremely desirous, to get rid of their
-incef~nt importunity, he endeavoured to pre-
, vai~l on the Landgr~ave to give up lthe obligation

wlhich- he had-c receiveda fromn the two Eledfors.
But that: 1Prince refusing to part with .a fcurit-y
which he deemed effenatial to his. ~safet~y , :the
Emperor ~boldly cut the knot which he could
ptot untiq; and -by: a publick deed annulled the
'bond which M'~aurice and. the ~Eledor of BFran-

their engagements to the` Landgr~ave. No- pre-

that of abrogatin~g at pleasure the mofLt sacre~d
laws, of honour, and moll fonrmal obligations
of ·publick ~faith, had, hitherto been formed by
any but the Roman Pontiffs, who, in confe-
quence of their claim of. 'infailllibilityr , arrogate
the right of dispensing with precepts and dutie~s
of every kind. All Germany was filled with
ait~onihme~nt ,. when Charles allim ed the fame

thq Empire was ]Ied~uced, a~ppear~ed to be more

rigoro~is as well as intolerable than that of the BOOK X.

peror by an arbitr'ary decree might: cancel those
folemri contraa~s, which are the foundation of
tha~t mutual confidence whereby men are held
tcigeth-er in social union. The Landgrave him-
self nopw gaveir up all hopes of rcovering his
liberty by the Emperor's cons~ent , and endea.-
vou~red to procure .it by his own addres~s, But:
the p~la~n which he had formedl to deceive "his
guards being difcoveredl, fch of his attendants

t~o deathn, ani-d he was confined in the citadel of
Imlechlin more closely than ever".

AN.OTHER tranf~adion was carried on during charterst

this diet, with refped to an affair more nearly can ofro.
interesting .to the Emperor , and which occa- "'" e'
SHoned- likewise a general alarm among thlecrown for
Princes of the Empire. Charl·es , though formed uh~~p~
wci-th talents which fitted him for conlceiving and
conduating great designs ,was not capable, as
has ,been often observed , of bearing extraor-
dinary success. Its operation on his mind was
so violent and intoxibating , that it elevated him
beyond what was moderate or attainable , and
turned his whole attention to the pursuit of vast
but· chimerical ob~jeats. Such had been the
effec2 of his viaory over the* confederates of

aSq x. the fubftantal and certain advantages which

were the result of that even't, but def~piling these,
as poor or inconsiderable fruits of fachl great
furccefs , he had aimed at bringing all Germany
to an uniformity in religion, and at rende'ring
the'Imperial power deflpotick. There were ob-
jects extremely s~plendid, indeed, and alluring
to an ambitious mind ; the pursuit in them a
howevier, was attended with Imanifeit danger,
and the attainment of them very. precarious.
13ut the steps which he had already taken to-
wards them, having been accompanied with s~uch
success , his imagination, warmed with contem-
plating this vast design, overlooked or depif~ied
all remaining difficulties. As; he conceived the
execution of his plan to be certain, he began to
be solicitous how he might render the pof~feffion
of such an -important acquisition perpetual in
his family, by transmitting the German ]Empire,
as well as the ktingdoms of Spain, and his do-
minions in Italy and the Low Countries, to
his son. Having long revolved this fl~attering
idea mn his mmnd, without commumicatmng it,
even to thos~e miniffers whom he most trafted,
h1e had called Philip out of Spain, in hopes that
his presence would facilitate the carrying for-
wJard the s~cheme.

GREAT obstacles , however, and ~such as Bdoor X

would have deterred any ambition les~s ajccuf- aqx
tomed to overcome difficulties , were to be f~ur. The obita.
mounted. He had in' the year one thousand a:~'
five hundred and thirty imprudently assisted in way.
procuring his brother Ferdinand the dignity of
King of the Romanas, and there was no proba-
Ibility that: this Prince , who was still in the
prime of life, and had a f~ol grown up to the
years of manhood , would relin quifh , in favour
of his nephew , the near profpedt of the Im-
perial thron~e, which Charles's - infirmities and
declining Rtate of health opened ·to hims~elf.
This did not deter the Emperor fr-om venturing
Ito make the proposition; and when Ferdinand,
notwithftandin g his profound reverence for his
brother, and~ obs~equious f~ubmifiron to his will
in other instances , rejeAed it in a peremptory
tone, he was not dis~couraged by one repul~se.
H-3e renewed his applications to him by his
fiffer, M9/ary Queen of Hungary, to whom Ser-
dinand stood indebted for the cr owrns both of
Hungaria and Bohemia, and who, by her great
abilities, tempered with extreme gentleness of
difpoloition, h'ad acquired an extraordinary in-
fluence over both the brothers. She entered
warmly into a measure, which tended so mani-
feftly to aggrandize · the house of Auffria; and
flattering herself that fbe could tempt Feirdinand

rs·91. Iperial ~dignity for an immnediate ·eitablifhi-

ment, the assured him tlhat: the Emper-or, 'byl
way of compens~ation for .his giving up his
chance; of fa~ccellion , wvould instantly beff~ow
upon him territories of v~ery considerable value,
and pointed out in particular those of the
3Duke of W~urtemberg, which might be con-
fif~cated upon diffe~rent pretexts. But neither
by her address nor in treaties , could thle indirce
Ferdinanr7.d to .approve of a plan , which would-
have degraded him from the highest rank
among ·the Mo/lnarchs of Europe to thatt of a
s~ubordinate and dependent Prince. He was , .at
the f~ame time, more attached to his child'ren ,
than by a rash~ concession to fruffrate all the
high hopes in prof~ped of which they had been
educated.

mis endea- NIOTWITHST'ANDING the immovable firmness
7~,to"worrwhich Ferdinand discovered , the Emperor did
ahere. not abandon ]his fchjeme. HKe flattered himrf~elf

that he might attain the objeR in: view by ano-
ther channel, and that it was not impofirble to
Sprevail on the Eledors to cancel their former

choice of Ferdinand, ~or at leaRt to eled5 Philip
a second King of the Romans, s~ubstituting hink~
as next in fuicceJion to his uncle. Withrih this
vriew he 'took Philip along wvith him to the diet,

that. the G'ermans might have an opplortunity BOOK TC.
,to . observe and become acquainted with the x 5r r.
Prince, in behalf of whom he courted their in-
terest; and he' himfaielf employed all -the arts 'of
address or insinuation to gain the Eled'ors, and
.to prepare them for lending a favourable ear
to the proposal. But no so~oner did b~e venture
upon mentioning it to them, than they , at
onse, saw and trembled at the confe~quencs with
wh~ich i~t would be attended. They had long
felt .all the inconveniences of having placed at;
the; head of the Empire a Prince vihof~e power
and dominions' were so extensive; if they shou~ld
now repeat the folly, and continue theImperial
crown, like an hereditary dignity, in the f~ame
family, th-ey foresaw that they would give the
fona an opportunity of carr);ing on that fy~ftern
of oppression, which · the fathert had begun; and
would put it in his power to overturn whatever
wras yet left entire in the ancient: and venerable
fabrick of the German constitution.

this extraordinary p~epofition was made , ren- charader'

dered it ft'ill less agreeable. Phihip, though pof- to the Ger-
s~ess~ed with an ins~atiable desire of power , was a mans.
ftraknger to all the arts of conciliating good -will.
Haughty, re erved, and severe , he, inflead of
gaining new friends, difkuffed the ancient' and

language of the country to the government of
wYhich he aspired; nor w~ould he condes~cend toi

-affedting- a stately and diitant dermeanour , which
the greatest of the German Emperors, and even
C~harles himnfelf, amidRt the pride of power and
viiAory , had never assumed ". O~n the other hand,
Ferdinand , from the time of his arrival in Ger-
inany, had ffudied to render himself acceptable
to the people, by a~conformity to their manners,
brhich seemed to flo~w from choi~ce; and his ~oln
I14aximilian, who was born in Germany, poff~effed,
in an eminent degree,' fuich amiable qualities as
reiadered him the darling of his countrymen,
and induced 'th~em~ to look for ward to his elec-
tion as a mioft defitiable event. T]heir esteem andt
afferaiorn for him, fortified ghe resolution which
found policy had suggested ; *and determined
the Germans to prefer the popular virtues of
Ferdinand and his son, to the stubborn auteyrity
of Philip, which interest could not Bjfofteii, nor

By his unseasonable ]perseverance in pufihing it,

family, and forced h~is brother Ferdinand, Iin ~self-

with them , as cut off all profped of renewing
the proposal with fuxccefs. Philip, soured by
his disappointment, was sent back to Spain, to

he might procure forne par-t of their domains to

~Albert count . Mansfeldt , who had the chief
command in M/agdeburgh. ~He consulted like-
wife with count Hleide~ck·, an officer who had
flierved with great reputation in the army of the
league of Smalkalde , whom the Emperor had
proscribed on account of his zeal for that cause,
Ibut: whom M~aurice had, notwithstanding, fe-
cretly engaged in his service , and admitted into
the most intima~te con~fidence. T]o th em hae
communicated a. scheme , which he had long
rPevolved in 'his mind , for procuring liberty, to
his father-in-law the Landgrave, for vindicating
·the privileges of the Germanic~k body, and ~et-
ting bounds to the dangerous encroach'ments
of the Imperial power. Having deliberated w~ith
them concerning the maeafures which might he·
necessary for fecuring' the [uccefs of such an
arduous enterprize, he gave M~ansfe~ldt secret
affixrances that the fortificat~ions of Mlagdeburghz
thould no~t be destroyed, and that the inhabitants
thou~d· neitsher be difturbedf in the exercise of
their r-eligion, nor be deprived of any of their
pa~cient immunitieg, In order to engage INlaur-ice

her son , 'faitable to their rank, and propor'-

rents, diitruffting others, de~itiute of friends,
and surrounded by Caitaldo's and I~aiartinazzi's

thne H-ungarians believed, had defCcended frorm

againeazmtioms,_ or becaus~e he despise~d Ferdinand's in-
' fidious arts, assumed the diredtion of the war

·oga~inft the Turks with his u~ual tone of autho-
rity, and conduaed it with great magnani-
rInity, and no less furccers. H~e rec~overed some
places of'which the Infidels had taken posses-

abortive; andi eftablithed F~erdinand's authority
not only in Ti~ranfy~jlvania, but in the Bannat of
Tfiemefwvar , and fCeveral of the countries adjacent.
In carrying on thes~e operations, he often diffred
in fentimnents from Caffaldo and his. ofklcers, and
treated the T~urk~ish prifobners with a degree not:
only of huma~nity, but even of generosity, which
Callaldo loudly condemned. This was rep~re-
seated at VB~ienina as an artful method of court-
ing the fr-iendsh-ip of the Infidels, that , by f~e-
caring their protedion, he might sh~ake off all
dependence upon the sovereign whom he now
acknowledged. TIkhough M~artinuzzi, in jufti-
fication of his own conduat, contended that it.
was impolitick to exasperate an enemy prone ·to
revenge by unnecessary severities, Caffaldo's ac-
cuf~ations gained credit with Ferdinan~d, prepof-
ifeffed already against Mlartinuzzi, and jealous
of every thing that couLld endanger his own au-
~thority in H~ungary, in pro~portion as he knew

by the intelligence which he transmitted con.
tinually to his confidents at Vienna. By rnifrew

ambitious Jprelatte. But Ferdinand , foreseeing
that it would be dangerous to .proceed in the
regular course of law against a fubjeA of such
exorbitant power , as enabled him to et his fove-

the request in behalf of the unfortunate pris~oner,

as he arrived at Infpruck, vihere he was every
day expedted , he did not deign to descend into
any more particular exphication of his inten-
tioris". This application , though of no benefi't
to the Landgrave , was of great advantage to
IVaaurice. It served to juffify his s~ubsequent
~proceedings , and to demnonfirate the necessity of
~employing arms in order to extort that equitable
concefizon, which his mediation or intreaty could
not obtain.' It wYas o~f ofe , too, to confirmn th~e

I s 2. his conduat which alarmed the Emperor ami~dst

his ~securi-ty , and tempted him · frequently to
fufped ·.that· he was meditating something extra-
or din-ary. As these fulp~icions took their rife
from circumstances inconsidera-ble in themselves,
or of an ambiguous as well as uncertain nature,
they were more than counterbalanced by Mau-
rice's address; atnd the Emperor would not,

r lightly , give up his confidence in a manl, whom

he had once truffed and loaded with favour~s.
One particular alone seemed to be of s~uch con-
-sequence, that he thought it necessary to de-
rnand an explanation with regard to it. The
troops , which George of M8ecklenburgh had
taken into pay after the capitulation of M~ag-
dceburghn, having fixed their quarters in Thurin-
gia, lived at diferetion on the lands of the rich
ecclefaiaticks in their neighbourhood. Their li-
cence and rapaciod~nefs were intolerable. Such
as felt or dreaded their exadtions, complained
loudly to the Emperor, and reprefenced them
as a body of men kept in readiness for some
desperate enterprize. *, But MBaurice, partly by
extenuating the enormities of which they had
been guilty, partly by repres~enting the impoffi-
bility of disbanding these troops, or of keeping
them to regular discipline, unless the arrears
still due to · thern by the Emper~or were paid,
either removed the apprehenflons which this

had occalloned, or as Charles` was not in a con- - BOOK 1.
dition to satisfy th~e demands of these soldiers, ass 2.
obliged him to be .silent with regard .to the

THE tiMe of adion was now approaching. Maurice

IVaurice had privately di~patched Albert ofor~~earS EP
B"randenburgh to Paris , mnworder to confirm his
league with Henry , and to hasten the· march of
-the French army. He had taken measures to
bring his ow~n f ubjeaes together. on the first f~um-
mons ; he had provided for the s~ecurity of
Saxony -while he thould be absent wvith the
army; and he held the troops in T~huringia , on
wihich he c~hiefly depended , readly to advance on
a moment's warning. All these complicated
operations were carried on 'wi hout beia g dif-j
covered by the court at Inf~pruck , and the Emr-
peror remained there in perfedt tranquillity,
busied entirely in counterading the intrigues of
the Pope's legate at Trrent, and in fettling thes
.conditions on which the Pr-otelltant divines fhouldl
be adm~itted into the council, as if there had
not been any tranfadtion of' greater moment ine

soon after his arrival at InfpIruck , with an in-
crea~se cf violence; and h~is constitution being
broken by 'fuch fr-equent attackrs, he was seldom
able to exert his natural vigour of m~ind, or to
conGder affairs with his us~ual vigilance and
penetratilon; and Granvelle, bis~hop of Arras,
his prime minister , though one of the most
fulbtle ft~atermen of that, or perhlaps of~ any ag-e,
was on this occasion the dupe of his own craft.
He entertained fach an high opinion of his owrn
abilities, and held thie political talents of the
Germans in fach contempt, that h~e d~efif-ied all
the intimations given him concerning Mlaurice's

and hi-s fiecret machinations , or the deangerous design~s
mninisers. which he was carrying on. WhT1en the Duke of

Alva, whose diark sus~picious mind harboaured
mnany doubts concerning the. Eledtor's tincerity,
propo~sed calling him immediately to court to
anfwver~ for his condua, Granv~elle replied with
great f'corn , ~That these apprehenflons were
gr·oundles~s, and that a drunken German head
was too gross to form any scheme which he
could not ealily penetrate and baffle. Ne~or did

he aPfume this peremptory tone merely from BOOK X.
confidence in his own discernment ; he had x sq .
bribed two of Maurice's ministers, and received
fr~m them frequent and minute information
concerning all their mafter's motions. But
through this very channel, by which he expeded
to gain access ·to all Maurice's counf'els, and
even to his thoughts, such intelligence was conr-
veyed to him as completed ·his deception.
INlaurice fortunately dis~covered the correfjpond.~
ence of the twYo traitors w~ith· Granvelle , but
·iniead of punishing them for their crime , he
dexterously availed himself of their fraud , and
turned his own arts against the bishop. H4e
affeated to treat these ruiniffers wyith greater
confidence than ever; he admitted them to his
cons~ultations; he seemed to lay open his heart
to them; and taking care all the while to let
them be acquainted with nothing but what it
was his interest should be known, they tranf-
mitted to Inf~pruck s~uch accounts as poffeffed
Granvelle with a firm belief of his sincerity as
well as good intentions '". The Emperor him-
self , in the fulness of security , wYas so little

nhe nege. THE conference at Lintz did not produce
fiation"S he. any accommodation. IVMaurice , when he con-
Emperor rented tO it, seems to have had nothing in view
and mtaurice but to amuse the Emperor; for he made fach
of no effec .

demands ·both ux behalf of his confederates,
and their ally the French ]King, as he knew
would not be accepted by a. Prince, too haughty
to submit, at once, to conditions didtated by
an enemy. But howyever firmly IV~aurice ad-
hered during the negociation to the interests of
his affbeiates, or howy Readily soever he kept
in view the objeats which had induced him to
take arms, he often profeffed a firong incli
pation to terminate the differences with the Em·
peror in an amicable manner. Encouraged b)
this appearance of a pacifick difpolition, Ferdi
Pend proposed a second interview at Paff~au or

the twenty-fixth of M/ay , and that a· truce B~O OKX.
should commence on that day , and continue to x sq .
the tenth of June, in order to give them leisure
for adjui~ing all the points in dispute.

ZJPoN this, IVdaurice rejoined his army on the Manirice nad

ninth of M/ay, which had now advanced to waisI c.
Gundelfingen. He put his troops in motion vruFB:
next morning , and as sixteen days yet remained
for adtion before the commencement of the
truce, he re~solved, during that period, to ven-
ture upon an enterprize, the success of which
would be so decisive, as would render the nego-
ciations at Paffau. extremely fhlort, and entitle
him to treat upon his own terms. He foresaw
that the proflpedt of a ceifation of arms, which
wvas to take place so soon , together with the
opinion of his earnefinefs to re-establish peace,
with which he had artfully amused Ferdinand,
could hardly fail of inspiring the Emperor with
su~ch false hopes, that he would naturally become
jremifs, and relapse into some degree of that
security which had !already been fCo fatal to
him. Relying o-n this co~nj8Eure, he march~ed
direAly at the head of his army towards In-
fpruck, and advanced with the rnoRt tapid
motion that could be given to so great a body
of troops. On the eighteenth he. arrived at
Fieffen , a psrit of great ednfequence, at the

entrance into the T~yrolef~e. There he found'
a body of eight hundred men, whom the Em.
peror had assembled, firongly intrenched , in
order to oppofie his progres~s. He attacked them
initantly with sauch violence and impetuolity
that they abandoned their lines precipitantly,
and falling back on a second body posted near
Ruten, communicated the panick terror with.
wvhich they them~selves had been seized, to thtofe
troops, so that they lik~ewise took to flight, after
a feeble resistance.

ELATED with this succes~s, wIhich exceeded his

mot sanguine hopes, IVaurice pressed forward
to Ehrenberg, a caffle situated on an high and
steep precipice, which commanded the only p-ass
through the m~ountains. As this fort had been
fulrrendered to the Protestants at: the beginning
of the Smalkaldick war, becaus~e the garrifCon was
then too weak to defend it , the Emperor, fen-
fible of its importance, had taken care, at this
jundiure, t~o throw into it; a body of tr~oops sus-
ficient to maintain it against the greatest- army.
But a shepherd , in pursuing a goat which had
Itrayed from his flock , having discovered an
unknown path by which it was possible to ascend
to the top of the rock, came with this season-
able piece of intelligence to IP/laurice. A finall

inutinied, declaring that they would not stir
until t bey had received the gratuity , which,
according to the cuf10m of that age , they
claimed as the recompence due to them for
having taken a. pla~ce by assault. It was with
great difficuk~y as well as danger, and not: with.
out some considerable 10fs. of time, that Mdaurice
quieted this infurredtion, and prevailed on the
soldiers to follow him to a place where he pro-
mif~ed them foch rich booty as would be an
ample reward for all their services.

The Empe. To the delay , occasioned by this un~foreseen
ror a~ui~es i accident, the ~Emperor owed his safety. He
from Inc. was informed of: the approach~ing danger late
PPrCk. in the evening, and knowing that nothing could

save him but a speedy flight, he infteantly left
Infpruck , withou~t regarding the darknefsr of
the night, or the violence of the rain which
halppened to fall at: that time;~ and notwith-
standing the debility occaf~oned by the gout
which rendered him unable to bear any motior
but that o~f a litter, he travelled by the light oi
torches, taking his way over the Alpsc, by road
almost imp~assable. His courtiers annd atten
dants followed him with1 equalprecipitation, foml
of them on fach horses as they could haftil]

utmoRt confusion. In this rmiferable plight, very x cj z.,
unlike the pomp with which Charles had appear-
ed 'during the five preceding years as the con1-
queror of Germany, he arrived at length with his
dejedted train at Villach in Cariathia, and fearce-
ly thought himself secure even in that *remote
inaccel3lible corner.

fMAURICE entered Infpruck a few hours after Mraurice en-

the Emperor and his attendants had left it; and ters that
enraged that the prey should escape out of his
hands when he was just ready to seize it, he pur-
sued them some miles; but finding it impossible-
to overtake persons, to whom their fear gave
speed, he returned` to the town, and abandoned
all the Emperor's baggage, together with that of
his miniffers , to be plundered by the soldiers;
while he prejferved untouchedl every thing be-
longing to the King of the Romans, either. be-
cause he had formed some friendly connexiona
with that Prince, or becalufe he withed to have
it believed that fuLch a connexion fa~bfifted be-
tween themn. As there now remained only three
days to th'e commencement of the truce, (with
thich nicety had MZaurice calculated his opera-
tions), he set out for Paffau, that he might meet!
Ferdinand on the day appointed.

a decree was iite~d proroguing~ the coulncil dlu-
ring two years, and appointing it to meet at the

THE tonvocation. of this affcembly had been we ena~

pationately desired by all the Rtates and Prinlces ftde-
in Christendom , who, from the wYifdom as w-ell
as piety of prelates representing the whole body
of the faithful, expeded some charitable and
efficacious endeavours towvards compoling the:
diffenflons which unhappily had arisen in the
church. But the several Popes by whole au-
thority it was called, had other objeas in view.
They exerted all their powser or policy to attain
these , and by the abilities as , well as address of
their legates, by the ignoranc~e of many of the

council, that they didSated all its decrees ,and
faramed them, not wyith anl intention t~o reflore
urd~ty and concord to the church, but to establish
their own domainion, or to confirm those tenets,
uipon which they imagined that dominion to be
founded. D~oarines, which had hitherto 'been
- admitted upon the credit of tradition alone, arid
received with· some latitudec of interpretation,
were now defined with a fcrupplous nicety, and
conf~irmed by ~the f~a~naion of authority. Rites,
wvhi~ch had formerly been obs~erved only in de-
ference to cuffom fulppofed to be ancient, were
establish~ed by the decrees of the church, and
declared to be essential parts of its worship.
THhe breach, inficad of being closed, was wvi-
den~ed, and made irreparable. In place of any.
attempt to reconcile the contending parties, a:
line was drawn with sauch fludied accuracy, as
ascertained and marked out the dittinaeion be-

Council· of Trent,whil~e the memory of yhat had BOOK X.
patlled- there was recent, and some who had been asq 2.
members of it .were still alive. He has exposed
the intrigues and artifices by which I~t was con-
duated, with a freedom and severity which have "
given a deep wound· to the credit of the council,
H3Ie has described its deliberations, and exalained
its decrees, with such perspicuity a~nd depth of
thought, with such various erudition and' faech
force of reason, as have juR~ly entitledf his work
to be placed among the noft -ad~mired. hifforical
compositions. Aibout half a. century thereafter,
the Jesuit * Pallavicini published~ his hriffory of
the council, in opposition to that of Father Paul,
and by employing all the force of a~n acute and
refining· genius to invalidate the credit, or to
co~nfuPte the reasonings of his antagonist, he las-
bours to prove, by artful apollogies for the pro-
ceedings of the council, and s~ubtile interpret-
ations of its decrees, that it: deliberated with
impartiality, and decided w~ith j~udgmenti as wrell .
as candour. Vargas, a Spanish dodor of laws,
w~h-o was appointed to attend the Irmperial ams-
baffad~ors at T~rent, sent the binhop· of Arr-as a
r·egular account of the tranfaaiosns there, ex-
plain~ing all- the arts which the Leg~ate employed
to influence or over-awe the council. Hfis Jet-

wYhichfoever of these 'authors an intelligent per-
fL on takes for his guide, irt forming a judgment
concerning the [Cpirit of~ the council, he must diif-
cover so much ambition as well as artifice among
some of the members, so much ignorance and
co~rruption among others; he must observe fach
a large infusion of human policy: and pat~ions,
minigled with fach a fic~anty portion of that fim-
p'icity of heart, annAity of manners, anld love
of truth, w7hich alone qualify men to determine
what doarinles are worthy of God, and what
worflhip is acceptablie to him; that he will find
it no eafys matter to believe , that anly extraordi-
nary influence of the ~Holy Ghost hovered over
this assembly, and didtated its decrees.

'Peh Frenenh WHILE Ma3[urice was employed in 'negociat-
com-avow,~ ing with the King of the Riomans at Lintz, or
strasbrcu. in making war on the Emperor in the ryTyol,

the French King had a~dvanced into Alsace as
far as Strafbkurgh; and having demanded leave
of the Senate to march through the city, he
hoped that, by . repeating the fame fraud which
he had p~radEited at M~etz, he might render him-
feclf master of the place, and by that means f~e-
cure a passage oaver the RPhine into the heart of

Gfermany. But the SraFburghers, infkruded and Boonr X,
put on their guard by the credulity and misfor- a2
tune of their neighbours , hut their gates; and
having assembled a garrison of five- thousand
soldiers, repaired their fortifications, rafed the
hloufes in their suburbs, and determinedl to defend
themxlfelves to the utmost. At the ~Fame timen
they sent a deputation of their- most r-efpedtable
citizens to the King, in order to divert him fr~om
making any hoitile attempt upon them. TPhe
Eledtors of TFreves and Cologne, the Duke of
Cleves, and other Princes in the neighbourhood,
interposed in their behalf; b~eseeching Henry
that he would not forgret so fbooir the title which
h-e had generously assumed; and infteald of being
the Deliverer of Germany, become its Opprelfior.
Th~Ie Sw~iss Cantons seconded th~em wTith zeal,

prize of so much value, if he had been in a con-
dition to have s~eized it. But, in that age, the
mnethkod of s~ubs~isting numerous armies at a dif-,
tance fr~om the fr~ontiers of t~heir own country,
was imperfeatly underflood ,andl neither the re-
venues of Princes., nor their experience in the

art of war , were equal to the great and compli-
cated efforts which fLuch an undfertakting required.
The French, though not far removed from their
own country, began already to fuffer from fear-
city of provii~ons, and had no fCufficient maga~-
zines collected to support them during a siege,
. which must neceffairily have been of great
length3". At the fame time, the Queen of Hun-
gary, governes~s of the Low Countries, had as-
fSembled a considerable body of troops, which,
under the command of M8lartin de Roffem, laid
waste Champagne:, and threatened the adjacent
provinces of France. Thkere concurring circurm-
~stances obliged the King, though with reluctance,
to abandon th~e enter prize. But being willing
to acquire some merit with his allies, by this
retreat which he could not avsoid, he pretended
to the Swis~s that: he had. taken th~e resolu~tion
merely in compliance with their reqluec"; and
then, after giving orders that: all the horses in
his army should be led to drink in the Rhine,
as a proof of his having pushed his conqueits so
far, he M~arched back towards Champagne.

viewed the progress of his power with jealousy
and dread. The uncomm~on and cordial unani-
rnity with which they, concuLrred at: this junc-
ture in enforcing Ma~;urice's demands, and in re·
commending peace, flowed from different causes.
Such as w~ere moit attached to· the R~oma-n catho-
lick church could not: help. observing, that the
P~rotestant: confederates werIe at the head of a
nlumerous army ,. awhile the Emperor was but
idt~ beginning to provi~de for his own defence.
Theyr fo~refawv that great efforts woultd be required
of them, and woul~d be necessary on their· part,
in order to cope with enemies, w-sho had bee@
allowed to get the flart so far , andi to attaia
fach formidable po~wer. Exp~erience had. tazugh)d

reaped by the Emperor alone, and the more xws .-
complete anayviatory proved which they thould
gain, 'the faster would they bind their own ~set-
ters , and render them the more intolerable.
Ttlefe refleaSions made them cautious how they
contributed a fCecond time, .by their indiscreet
zeal, to put the Ednperor in poirffeion of powier
which would be fatal to the liberties of their
country. Notwithstanding the implacable fierce-
ness of the ;spirit of bigotry in that age , they
chose rather that the Protelkants thould acquire.
that security for their religion which they -de-
manded, than by' afif~ting C'harles to oppress
them, to give fCuch additional force to the Ilmpe-
rial prerogative, as would overturn the conftitu-
tion of the Empire. To all these considerations,
the'dread of feeing Germany laid waste by a civil
war , added new force. Many Rtates of the Emr-
p~ire already felt the deftrudive rage of Albert's
arms, others dreaded it, and all w~ished for an
accomsmodaetion between the Emperor and Mau-
rice which they hoped wvould save them from
that: cruel scourge.

SunH were the reasons that induced to many we moeves

rrss. su~re. ·The motives which, prompted Charles to

desire it, were not fewer or of less weight. He
w~as pe:rfecaly fenfibble of the s~uperiority which
the confederates had acquired throu~gh his
own nleglig-ence; and he nowv felt the infu~fi.
ciency of his ow~n resources to oppose them.
H~is Spanish fubjeas, dlifguffed at his long ab.
f~ence, and wieary of endle~ss wars, which were of
no benefit to their country, refused to furifhl
him any considerable supply either of men or
mnoney; andi although by his addres~s or impor.
teunity, he might have hoped to draw from themn
at last more effeau-al aidt; thazt, he knaew, was
too difiant to be of any service in the prefeat
exigency of his affairs. His treasury was drain.
ed; his veteran forces were dispersed, or dif-
banded, and he could not depend much ei'ther
on the fidelit~y or courage of the. new levied fol·
diers whom he was colleding. Tihere .\vas no
hope of repeating with faccefs the fCame artifices'
·which had wVeakenied and ru~ined the- Smalkald~ick
leag-ue. As the end at which he aimed was now/
knovn , he could no longer employ the s~pecious
pretexts, which had formerly concealed his am-
bitious defgns. Every Prince in Germany was
alarmed and on his guard; and it was vain to
think of blinding them a -second time to su~ch
a degree, ·as to make one part of them inflirm
rnents to enslave t'he other. The fCpiith of a

experience had taught him, to be very different
from that of the league of Smalkalde; and
from what he had already felt, he had no reaf~oa
to flatter himself that; its counsels would he as
irresolute, or its eifforts as timid and feeble. I9f
he thiould resolve on continuinlg the war, he
might be assured , that thle most conliderable
itates in Germany would take part in it against
him s and a dubious neutrality was the utmost~
he could expedt from the reft. W~h~ile the con-
federates found full employment for his arms
in one quarter, the King of France would seize
the favourable opportunity, and push on his
operations in another, with almost cer-tain fuc.
cess. T~hat monarch had already made con-
quests in the ]Empire, which he was no less eager
torecover, than impatient to be revenged on
him for aiding his malecoantent fiubjeats. Though.
Henry had now retired from the banks of the.
IRhine , he had only varipd the scene of hoffi-
ilities, having invaded the Low Countries with
all his forces. The T~urks, routed by the soli-
citations of the French King, as well as f~imu-
lated by resentment ag-ainst Ferdinand for having
violated the truce in Hungary, had prepared a7
powerful fleet to ravage the coasts of NJaples and
Sicily, which he had left: almost def~encele~s , by
calling thence the greatest part of the regular r55 2.

with the greatest earn efine~s , the arguments
which the Princes assembled there had employed
in recommending it. H~e had observed, not
without s~ecret fatisfad~tion, the fatal blow that;
hadl been given to the defpotick power , which
his brother had ufkirped in the Empire. He
was extremely solicitous to prevent Charles from
recovering what he had loft, as he forefawy that
he would immediately res~ume with fresh eager-
ners, and Wyith a better chance of faccefs, his
fav'ourite scheme of trabnfmitting that power to
his son by excluiding him from the right of sac·
c~efiron to the Imperial throne.' On this ac·

Scount, he was willing to contribute towards

c;ircumscribing the Imperial authority, in order
to render his own poff~effion ds it certain. Be·
sides, Solyman, exasperated at the loss of T~ran·
£ylvania, aind still more at: the fraudulent; arts
by which it had been s~eized, had -ordered into
the field a.n army of an hundred thousand men,

and he ~ould not even hiope to draw from Ge~r·

sued~ with such earnestness and assiduity , coun-
terbalanced , for fComxe time , the force of all the
mon~tives . which disposed him to peace , and not
only put that evenit at a difiance, but: seemed
to render it uncertain. Wrhen M~laurice's' de-
mands , together with the letter of the mediators
at Paffau, were prefeated to him, he peremp-
tarily reftifed to redres~s the grievances which
were pointed out, nor would'he agree to anly
stipulation for the immediate security of the
Prot~estant religion, but proposed referr~ing both
these to thne determination ~of a future diet. On
his part, he req~uired , that instant reparation
thlould be made to all who , during the prefeat
war , had -fufe~red either by the licentiousness of
t-he confedefitte troops, or the exadious of their
leaders.

Maurice's ~MAURICE , who w~as well acquainted wiith the
'" g~ruoSu Emperor's -arts, immediately coricluded that he
r~maciiae it·had nothing inl viewc by there overtures but Ito

amuse antd deceive ; and therefore, . without
list~ening to Ferdinand's· intreaties , he left JPaffau
abruptly, and joining his troops which were
encamped at NIergentheim ,. a city in Franconia,
beolonging to the knights of the Teutonick order,
he put themn in motion, and renewed hoffilities.
As three thous~and meni in the- Emperor's payp

had thrown themselves into Frankfurt on the BDOO Xs.
M4aine , and might from thence infelt the neigh· ' Ir 2.
bouring country of Hesse, he matched towards
that city and laid siege to it in form. The j^^00s
briskness of this enterprize , and the vigour w~ith
whiclh IVlaurice carried on his approaches against
the town , gave such. an alarm to the. Emperor ,
as difppofed him to lend a more favourable ear
to Ferdinand's arguments in behalf of an accom-
mnodaetion. Firm and haughtyz as his niature
wras, he found it necessar~y to bend , and figni*
fied his veillingners to make concessions on his
part, if IVaurice in return , would abate som~e
wYhat of the rigour of his demands. Ferdinand,
as soon as he perceived .that his brother began
to yield , did not de lift from his impor tunities ,
until he prevailed on him to declare what was
the ultmoit that he would grant for the.fcurityi
of the confederates. ]Hav~ing gained this difHi
cult point, he instantly dis~patched a messenger
to MVaurice's camp ·and imparting to him the
Emperor's final resolution, conjured him not to
~fruffrate his endeavours for the rre eftablifhmrent-
of peace, or a by an uns~eas~onable obstinacy ori
his fide ,-t~o disappoint the wishes of all Ge~rmany~
for that~ salutary event.

.fVIAlf RICE , not~idit~iffanding the' prof~perodUs manciew

situation of his affairs, was firongly inclined to neurouD~S of
lifften to his advice. Tlhe Emiperor., tlhough modation.,

. rpighte be, while thte first effea~s of his confier-
~nation remained-, hne was fenfiible that Char-les
muff at Jaft acd with vigour proportional to the
:extent of his power and territoriesj an~d lead into
@ ermany)~ an army formidabjle by its numbers,
anlld ftail more-by the terror of his name, as well
as the remembrance of his pas1 vidories.· He
could fearcely -hope that a confederacy com-
posed of so many members would continue to
operate with f~ufficient union and perseverance to
resin2 the consistent and wYell-dired~ed efforts ·of
ant army, at the a-bsolute disp~osal of a leader
accuffomed to commard and to conquer. He
felt already , although~ he had not hitherto ex-
perienced the shock of any adverse event, that
he was-the head of a disjointed body. He fawr,
from the example of Albert of Brandenburgh,
how dif~icult it would be , with all his address
and credit , to prevent any particular member
from detaching hirmfelf from the whole, and
·how impofible to recal him to his proper rank;
andi. subordination.. This filled him with appre-
henflons ~for th~e common cause. Another-con-~
fideration gave him no less disquiet with regard
to his own particul~ar intLerefts. By setting at li-
·berty - he degraded Eledeor, and by repealing

.. . the ad~ depriving him of his hereditary honourS

and dominions , the Emperor had it in his power
to wound him in t~he moRt sensible part. The
efforts of a Prince beloved by his ancient s~ub-
jeCt's, and revered by all the ProteI~ant party,
in order to recover what had been unjuffly taken
from him, could hardly have failed of- exciting
commotions in Saxony, which would endanger
all that he had acquiired at; the expence of s~o
much difli~mulation anid artifice. It was no lefCs
in the Emperor's power to render' vain all the
folicitations of the con~federates in behalf of thte-
Landgrave. He had only to add one ac't of
violence more to the injuff~ice and rigour with
which he had already treated hime; and he had
accordingly threatened the sons of that: unfortu-
nate Prince, that if they persisted in their pre-
sent enterprize , inficadi of feeing their fatther·
reffored to l-iberty, they thould hear of his having
fuffered the punishment which his rebellion had,

rice ha~d in view, at those diff~eren.t Jundtures ,
seem to have beent more attended to· thari the
means by which he attained them; and he was
now as universally extolled fo·r his zeal and -
Zpublick spirit . as he had lat~ely been condemned
for his indifference and initerefted policy. It is
no lefk worth y of obfervation',.that th·e Fr-ench

proteat and . maintain the Reformation in the6

which he had given them ,by his acquiifiions
in Lorrain. A th~ort clause which .they pro-
cured to be inserted in the treaty, importing
that the K~ing of France might communicate to
the confederates his- particular pretenflons or
caufes' of hoffility, which they would lay before
the Emperor, was the only sign that they gave
of their remembering how much they had been
indebted to ,him for their success. Henry ex-
perienced the fame treatment, which every Prince
whollr l1nend his aid to the authors of a civil war
may exped. As soon as the rage of fadtion
began to subside , and anly profped of accom-
modation to open,.his services were forgotten,
and his associates made a merit; with their ~fove-
reign, of the ·ingratitude with wh'ich they aban--
doned their protedior. But how much soever
Henry might be enraged at the perfidy of his
allies , or- at the impatience with which they
hastened to make their peace with th~e Emperor
at his expence, he was perfeatly sensible that it
was more his interest to keep well with the Ger-
rnanick body,. than to resent the indignities of-
fered 'him by particular members of it. For
that~ reafonu he dismissed the hostages which he
had ;received from MVaurice and his ass~ociates,

the 'Landgrave, an account of this reached the

the objeat of compafflon.- John Frederick took
polletfion accordingly of that part: of his terri.

IV[aurice was invefied with the Eledoral dignity.
As in this situation, he continued to display
the fame virtuous magnanimity for which he had

:or recolvesmade a deep impreflion on the Emperor. Ac-
war upon cuffomed to terminate all his operations againf1
France. France with advantage to hirmfelf, he thought

that it nearly concerned his honour not to allow
Henry the superiority in this war , or to fuffer
his own adminiffraticm to be Rained with ..the
infamy of having permitted territories of fulch
consequence to be difmnembered from the Em-

pire. This was no less a point of interest than BoonI XLI
of honour. As the frontier of Champagne was .
more nakied, and lay more exposed than that of
any province in ~France , he had frequently , du-
ring his wars with that kingdom, made inroads
upon it with great s~uccess and effect; but if
Henry were allowed to retain .his late conqueits,
France would gain such a formidable barrier on
that fide, as to be altogether secure, where for-
merly the had been weakest. On the other
hand , the Empire had now - 10t as much , in
point of security , as France .had acquired; and
being firipped of the defence which those cities
afforded it, lay open to be invaded on a quarter,
where all the towns having been hitherto con-o
fidered as interior ,and remote from any enemy,
were but slightly fortified. THhefe considerations
determined Charles to attempt recovering the
three towns of which Henry had made himself
master , and the preparations w~hich he had made
against Maurice and his ass~ociates, enabled him
to carry his resolution into imme~diate execu-
tlOD.

As soon, then,as th~e peace wyas concluded atIis prepara.

Paffau, he left his in lorious retreat at Villacly exons fo"r',
and advranced to Augf'burgh, at the head of a
considerable body of Gsermans which he had
levied, toget~her with ali the troops which- he had

Irsz. _added- several battalions,which having been in

the, pay of the confederates, entered into his
service when difmniffed by them; and he pre.
vailed likewise on some princes of the Em.
pire to join him with their vass~als. ~In order
to conceal the dehrinattion of this f~ormidable
army, and to guard against alarming the French,
so as to put them on jeparing for their de-
fence, he gave out that he· was to march forth-
writh into H~ungary, in order to second M~aurice
in- his operations against the Infidels. When
he began to advance towards the Rlhine , and
could no longer employ th~at pretext, he triedi
a new artifice, andl spread a report, that he took
this route in order to chastis~e Albert of Branden-
burgh, ~whose cruel exactions in that part of the
Empire called loudly for his interpolition to
check them.

nie precauo BUT the ]French having grow~in acquainted,
~~ons om"1~ at Jaft, .with .arts .by which they had been so

and many died. At; length , fach breiches were

all the remonftrances of his generals concerning
the imprudence of at~tacking a numerous gar-
rifon, conduaeed and animated by thle most
gallanlt of the French nobility , with an army
weakened by diseases, and difheartened with ill
furccefs. TFhe Duke of Guif~, ~fufeaing the Em-
peror's intentions fr~om the extraordinary hurry
whkich he obfervedl in the enemy's camp, ordered
all his troops to their refpedive podts. They ap-
peared immediately on the walls, and behind.
the breaches, with ~uc-h a determined coun-
tenance , so eager for the combat, and s~o well
prepared to giv~e the assailants a warm recep,
tion, that the Imperialists, innead of advancing
to the charge when the word of command was
given, stood motionless, in a timid dejeaed
silence. T~he E1mperor , perceiving that he could
not truR troops whose spirits were so much
broken, retired abruptly to his quarter~s, coma-

plaining that he was now deserted by his fol- BOOKr XL,
diers, who deserved no longer the name of men'. z

D~EEPLY as this behaviour of his troops myor-The Empe-

tifiedE and a~ffeed Charles, he wyould not heari·h meha
of abandoning the siege, though he saw the of ttas.·
necessity of changing the method of attack. He
suspended the futry of his batteries, and pro-
posed to proceed, by the more secure but tedious
method of fa'p~ping. But as it; flill continued
to rain or to snow almost incefifantly, fach as
were employed in this service endured incre-
dible hardflhips: and the D~uke of GuifCe, whose
induffry was not inferior to his valour, discover-
ing all their mines, counterworked them, and
prevented their effea. At last, Charles finding
it impossible to contend any longer with the
rigour of the seas~on, and with enemies whom
he could neither overpower by force, nor sub-
due by art, while at the fame time a contagious
distemper raged among his troops, and cut off
daily great numbers of the officers as well as
s-oldiers , yielded to the folicitations of his gene-
rals, who conjured him to save the remains of
his army by a timely retreat ; " Fortune, "

found all their engagements with him to be

extorted by force; enjoined A~lbert to renounce
all claim to the performance of them; and, if
he thould persist in such. an unjust demand, ex-
horted all the Princes of the Empire to take

the confirmation of his tranf~a~ions with the .two
prelates, which the Emperor had granted ·him
as the reward of his having joined the Imnperial
army at M~etz; and in order to 'intimidate hisi
antagonists, as well as to convince them of his
resolution not to relinquish his pretenflons, he
put his troops in motion, that he might secure
the territory in question. Various endfeavours
were employed, and many expedients proposed,
in order to prevent the kindling a new war in

rss 3. may jurffly be confider'ed as the most remarkable.

If his exorbitant ambition, his profound difi.~
mulation, and his unwarrantable ofurpation, of
his kinf'man's honours and dominions, exclude
him from being praised as -a virtuous man'; his
prudence in concerting his measures, his vigour
in executing them, and the uniform succes~s witha
which they were attended, entitle him to the
appellation of a great Prince. At an age, when
impetuosity of spirit commonly, predominates
over political wis~dom, when the highest effort
even of a genius of the fir~st order is to fix on
a bold scheme, and to execute it with prompti.
tude and courage, he formed and condufied an
intricate plan of policy , which deceived the most
artful M~lonarch in Europe. A4t the very junc-
ture when the Emperor had attained to almofE
unlimited despotism, Maurice, with power s~eem-
ingly mnadequate to s~uch an un<;ertaking, com-
pelled him to relinquilh all his ufurpations, and
eftablifbed not only the religious but civil liber-
ties of Germany on s~uch foundations as have
hitherto rem~ined unshak~en. Although, at one
period of his life, his condult excited the jealousy
of the Protestants, and at another, drew ton him
the resentment of the Roman Catholicks, such
was his masterly addref>, that he was the only
Prince of the age whoe, in any degree, poffeffed

the confidence of both, and whom both lamented BOOK X11
as the most able as well as faithful guardian of Irs 3.
the constitution and laws of his country.

THE conf2iernati;on which Mlaurice's d~eath oc- lbert com.~

cafloned among his troops, prevented them from ones ar
making the proper improvement of the vic-
tory which they had gained. Albert, whose ac-
tive courage, and profuse liberality, rendered
him the darling of fach military adventurers as
were little solicitou~s about the juffice of his cadfe,
soon re-·assembled his broken forces, andi made
fresh levies w~ith fac~h succe~ss, that: he was·
quickly at: the head of fifteen thousand men,
and renewed his depredations with additional
fury. But Henry of Brunswick having -taken
the command of the allied troops, defeated him
in a second battle, fearcely less bloody than th-e sent. Ip.
former. Even then his courage ,did not fink,
nor were his resources exhauffedt. He mad~e
several efforts, and some of them very vigorous,
to retrieve his affairs:: But being laid under thei
ban of the Empire by the Imperial chamber;
being driven b~y diegrees out of all his hereditary
territories, as well as those which he had usurped;
being forsaken by many of his officers, and
overpowered by the number of his enemies, he
fled for refuge into F'rance. After having been, we is crivenP

he had been violently stripped after the Smal-

pleaded his right not only to the hereditary pof-

greatly difgulled all ranks of men, and alienated BOOK Xr.

·dignation at this, added to their desire of re-
venging MVartinu~zzi's death, wrought so much
upon a turbulent nobility, impatient of injury,
and upon a fierce people, prone to change, that;
they were ripe for a revolt. At that very junc-
ture, their late Qpueen Ifatbella, -together with

Solyman was then ·engaged in a war with Persia,
and involved besides in dome~ftick cala~nities which
engrossed and. disturbed his mind. Solyman,
though distinguished, by many accomplishments,
fr~om the other Ottoman· Princes, had all the

ness, however, which the derived from the un-
bounded sway that she had acquired over a
monarch whom one half of the ..world revered
or dreaded, was embittered by perpetual reflec-
tions on MIultapha's acceflion to the throne,
and the certain death of her so~ns, w~ho, the fore-
saw, would be immeaiately sacrificed, according
to the barbarous jealousy· of Turkilh policy, to
the safety of the new Emperor. By dwelling
continually on this melancholy idea, the came
gradually to view IVluffapha, as the enemy of
her children, and to hate him with more than
a fiep-mother's ill-will. This prompted her to
wYith his deffrudlion, in order to fEtlure for one
of her own frons the throne which was destined
for him. NE~or did the wa~nt eit~her amb~iti~on tos
!attempt fachga high enterpris~e, or the arts re-

perceiving that it was his own interest to co-
operate with her, readily promised his afifiiance
towards aggrandizing that branch of the royal
line, to which he was to nearly -allied.

deemed by the Turks meritorious in the highest
degree. T'he IV~ufti whom the consulted, ap.
proved much of her pious intention; but, having
been gained and infiruded by Rultan·, told her,
that the being a slave coilld derive no benefit
herself from that holy deed, for all the merit of
it would accrue to Solyman, the master whos~e
property the 'was. ULpon this the seemed to be
overw~helmed with f~orrowv, and to fink into the
deepest melanchol~y, as if she had been difguffed
with life and all its enjoyments. Solyman, who
was absent with the aramy, being informed of
this dejeation of mnind , 'andl of the clause from
which it proceeded, ,discovered all the fo~icitude
of a lover to remove it, and by a'writing under
his hand declared her a fr~ee wom~an. R~oxalana
having gained this point, proceeded to build
the Mlofq~ue,' and re-aff~umed her dufal gaiety
of spirit. But when. Solyma~n, on his return to
Constantinople, sent an eunuch. according to
thne cuffom of the s~eraglio, to bring her to par-
'take of his bed, she, ·-seemingly with deep re-
gret, but in the . most peremptory mlanner, de-
clined to follow the eunuch , declaring that .what
had bjeena an honour to her while a slave, became

Solyman, wihofie pafi~on this difficullty, as w~ell

As soon as he joined his army near Aleppo, and

credit the accusations of his ·enemiePs by the
promptitude of his obedience , followed the
Ixneffenger withiout deliy· to Aleyppo. T~lhe mo-
Inent he arrived in the camp, he was introddced
into the Sultan's tent. As he entered it, he
observed nothing that could give him any

·with terror at the thoughts of M~ultaphna's efeap-

the tent, and thruffing in his head, darted a
fierce look towards the mutes, and with wYild
and threatening geffures seemed to chide thern
for sloth and timidity. A~t fight of his father's

ready, if a leader had not been wanting, to
have broke· out into~ the wildest excesses of rage.
After giving vent to the first expre~ffons of their
grief, they retired each man to his tent, and
ihiutting thems~elves up, bewailed in secret the
cruel fate of their favourite; nor was -ther-e one
iof them who tasted food or even water during
the remainder of that day. Next morning the
fame solitude and silence reigned in the camp;
and Solyman, Ibeing afraid that some dreadful
storm would followY this s~ullen calmh, in ordei- to
appease the enraged soldiers, deprived Ruffan
of the s~eals, ordered him to leave the camp,
and raised Achmet, a gallant o~fficer much beloved
in the army , to the dignity of Vifier. This
change, however, was made in concert with
3Ruffan himself; that crafty miniffer fuggeffing
it as the only expedient which could sa~ve him-
self or his mnafter. Bfut within a few months,
when the resentment of the Soldiers began to
~subside, and the name of Multapha to be for-
gotten , Achmet wias strangled by the 'Sultan's
confand, ·and Ruftan reinflated in the office
of Vifier. Together with his former power, he
re-a.10amned the plan for exterminating -the race

most uneasiness, of admitting a foreign P~rinlce

They dreaded, both from Pghilip's overbearing

infuife ideas into the Queen's mind , dangerous
to the liberties of t~he nation, and would intro-

FU LL of these apprehenflons , the house of

:eCommons, though in that age extremely obfe-
quious to the will of their IMonarchs, presented
a w~arm address against the Spanish? match;
many pamphlets were publish~ed,· representing
the dangerous confetquences of the alliance with
Spain, and deferibing Philip's bigotry and ar·
rogance in the most odious colours. But Mary,
intlexible in all her resolutions, paid no regard
to ·the remonfirances of her ·Comamons, or to the
sentiment of the people. T~he Emperor , hav-
ing secured, by various arts, the ·minifiers whom

w~ith regard that,~ if the~y were permitted to gather strength

sion of the ]French ouxt of the SienefCe, before
thzey had time to eftablifhr theinfelve~s thoroughlyl

from France as wFould render it dangerous to,
attack them, As this, however, was properly
the Emperor's bufiners, who was called by his
interest as well as honour to dislodge 'tho~e~
formidabl-e intruders into the heart of his do-
minions, Colrmo laboured to throw the whole
burden of the enterprize on him; and on that:
account had given no afif~tance, diving the former
campaign, bunt by advancing some finaall sums
of' money towards the payment of the Imperial
troops.

H~e neoa.ci Btre as the defernce of the· Netherlands· ern

Thiry, it was obvious that his operations in Italy
would be extremely feeble; and Colino plainly
perceived , that if he hims~elf did not take part

openly in the war, and act with v~igour, the
French would fearcely meet with any annoy-
ance. As his sItuatio~n rendered this refiolution
necei'fary and unavoidable, his next care was to
execute it in such a manner , that he might de-
rive from it so~me other advjantage, beside that
of driving the French out of his neighbourhood.
W~ith this view, he difipatched an envoy to
Charles, offering to declare war against France,
and to reduce Siena at his own. charges, on
condition that he thould be repaid whatever he
thould expend in the enter~prise, and be per-
mitted to retain all his conqueits until dris de-
mands were fully fTatisfied. Charles , to whom,
at this junCture, the war againf1 Siena wa~s an
intolerable burden, and who had neither expe-
dient nor resource that could enable him to cdarry
it ' on with proper vigour, closed gladly with
this overture; and Cofimo,, well acquainte~d with
the low state of the Imperial finances, flattered
himself that the Emperor, finding it imposs~ible

one of his: daughters to that Pontiff's nephew.
He attempted to detach the ~Duke of Orsini,
w~hose family had been long attached to the
]Frenach party, from his ancient: confederates, by
beffowin g on him another of his daughters; and
what wras of greater consequence than either .of

owves the these, *he engaged John James Mledecino, M~Zar-

Ih~qis am oqi of Mk3arignano, to take the command of his

Medecino. arlmy2 .This officer, from a very low condition

in lihfe, had raised himself, through all the ranks
of service, to high command, and had difpg~layed
talents, and acqjuired: reputation in war, which
entitled him to be placed on a level with the
greatest generals in that martial age. Having·
attained a station of eminence fb difpropor-
tionate to his birth-, he l~abouzred with a fond
solicitude to conceal his original obfcjurity, by
giving out that he was descended of the family
of MVedici, to which honour the cafuzal refem·
bl~ance of his name was ~his only pretension.
Co~fmao, happyi that he could gratify him at fulch
an easy rate, flattered his vanity in this point,

applied.with wonderful zeal and assiduity to raise
troops; and as, during his long s~ervice, he had
acquired great credit with the leaders of those
mercenary bands which formed the firengtht
of Italian armies, he engaged the most eminent:
of thaem to followv Cofmo~'s standard.

To oppofie this able general, and the formi-veter stroz-

dable army which he had affrembled, the King setran',eS
of Fratice made choice of Peter Strozzi, a Floicommana or
rentine nobleman, who had resided long in ench,
F~rance, as an exile, and- who had risen by his narly.
merit to high reputation, as well as .comlmand
in the army. Hie was the son of Ph-ilip Strozzi,

in the attempt: to expel the family ~of M~ed~ic
ourt of Flo~rence , in order to re-es~tablish thEe an-
cient republican form of govern~ment s and. who
had. perished in the undertaking. T1he son in-
herited the implacable averflon to the MIedici,
as well as the f~amne enthufiaficik zeal for- the
libert~y of Florence which had animated his
father, whose -death he wyas impatient to revenge.

The impru· . EUT ITOW specious soever the motives might ap.
aene of this peari which induced Henry to make this choice,
clnoice. it proved fatal to the interests of France in Italy.

Cosmo, as soon as he heard that the mortal enemy
of his family was appointed to take the comn-
miand in Tuscany , concluded that the King of
F~rance aimed at fiomething more than the pro-
tea~ion of the Sienef~e, and saw the necess~ity of
miaking extraordinary efforts, not. merely to re-
dLuce Siena, but to fatve himself from deftruc-
tion"g. At the ~fame time ,the Cardinall of Ser-
rara, ?who had the entire direaioli of the Frencht
affairs in Italy, considered. Strozzi as a formid-·
able rival in power, and in order to prevent his
acquiring any increase of authority from success,
he was extremely remi~ss in supplying him either
wyith money to pay his troops, or with provi-
-sons to s~upport them. Strozzi hims~elf, blinded
by his res~entment against the MDiedici, pulbedd on
his operations wvith the impetuosity of revenge,

governor of Milan were in condition to afford
him any effeatual aid; and as the troops which
Medecino had left in the camp before Siena
could attempt nothing against it during his a~b-

tradted the war, and to have transferred the feat

hope of ruining his ennemy by one decisive blows *
precipitated him into a general engagement not:

himself at the head of the infantry, and mani-

the provfiflons in the magazines with the rmoit

soldiers, a s well as the citizens, to reftridt them-
selves to a very moderate daily allowance for
their faubiffence. MIedecino, though his armyi
was not numerous enoughn to florm the town byi

Ilary, -diversity of sentiment concerning the ob·
Sjeat or rites of religious worship s~eems to have

been no source of animosity, because the ac·

Iknowledging veneration to be due to any one

· the power of any other God; nor were the

mosndes and rites of worship establish~ed in one
country incompatible with -those which other

Snations approved of and observed. , T~hus the'

BUT wvhen the Chriftcian revelation declazred

one Supreme Being to be the sole objeA of r~
ligious veneration, prescribed the form of warI
ship most acceptable to him, whoever admitteA
Sthe truth of it, held, of consequence, every othe
mode of religion to be abs~urd and impiot.

Hene hezeal of the firfe converts to ~the Chkjl

tian faith in propagating its doatrines, and the~

ardor wth wichthey laboured to overtre

every other form of worship. They employed
however, for this purpose no methods bout ifuck'

as faited the nature of religion. By the force BOOKr 11.
of powerful arguments, they convinced the un- x ss 5.
derltandings of men; by the charms of superior -A
virtde, they allured and captivated their hearts.
At length the civil pow~er.declared in favour of
Christianity; and though numbers, imitating
the example of their foperiors, crowded into the
chuurch ,many f~ill adhered to their aincient f~u-
perftitions. Enraged at their obstinacy, the mini-
fiers of religion, whose zeal was flill unabated,
though their f~rancity and virtue were much di-
minifhed, forgot so far the nature of their own
mifi~on, and of the arguments which they ought:
to ~have employed, that they ar~med the Imperial
power againRt these unhappy men, and as they
could not perfo~ade, they tried to compel them
to believe.

ATr the fame time, controversies concerning

articles of faith multiplied , from various causes,
among Christians thems~elves, and the fame un-
hallowed weapons which had sirs been used
against the enemies of their relig~ion, were turned
against each other. Every zealous difp~utanst
:endeavousred to interest the civil magiffrate in
-his .ca~use, and each ir$ his turn employed the
.Secular arm to crush or to exterminate his oppo-
d·ents. Not long aLfter,· the bilhops of .Rome
~put in their claim to i~nfallibility in explatining

BOOK XI. articles of faith . and deciding 'points in contro-

Irs s verfy; and, bold as the pretension was , th~ey,;

by their artifices and perseverance , imposed on
t~he cr~edulity of mankind, and brought them; t6`
recognise it;. TPo doubt or deny any doc-
trine to which these unerring infirudors had-
given the fand~ion of their approbation, was;
held to be not only a resisting of truth, but an'
adt of rebellion against their sacred authority::
and the secular power , of which by various ,zrts
Sthey had acqjuired. the absolute dire~tion, was;
instantly employed to avenge both.

TarUS Europe had been accuffomned , during

many centuries, to fee s~peculative opinions pro·
pagated or defended by force; the charity and~
·mutual forbearance which Christianity recom3
Smends with so much wrarmth, were forgotten~
the sacred rights of conscience and of privat~
Sjudgment were ud~heard of , and not, only the~
idea of toleration, but even the word· itself ,. in
Sthe sense nowK affixed to it, was unknown. A
right to extirpatz error 177 force, was universally
allowced to be the prerogative of s~uch as po~
feffedi the knowvledge of· truth ; and as each part~
o ss Christians· believedl· that .they had~;ngot p~oses
flon of this invaluable. attainment, they al(
claimed'`and exerlcifed, ;s ~far as they wvere abid~
Ihe .i~ghts which it was .supposed to conveyr
SThe Roman cat~holicksy as their fyT~sem rested on

that truth was on their fide, and openly called rys5.
on the civil power to repel the impious and
heretical innovators who had risen up against it.
The Protestants, no les~s confident that their
dodtrine was wiell founde'd, required, with equal
ardour , the Princes of their party to check such
as presumed to impugn or to oppose it. Luther,
Calvin, Cranmer, Knox, the foulnders of- the re-
formed church in their respective countries, in-
flicted, as far as they had power and opportunity,
the- fame punishments which were denounced
against their own disciples by the church of
Rome, upon such as called in question anly article
in their creeds. Tio their followers , and per-
haps to their opponents, it would have appeared
Sa sy~mptom of diff~idence in the goodnes~s of their
:cause, or an acknowledgment that it was not
:well founded, if they ha'd not employed in its
defence all those means which it was jfuppofed
truth had a right to employ.

IT was toward-s the clos~e of~ the ~seventeenth

:century, before Toleration: u~nder its pref~eat
~form, was admitted first into the republick of the

I[talian , wiho had nzeareft accejfs to obser~ve his

years appliedl to fludy wijth all the afi~duity of
a man, who ha~d nothing bjut his personal~ accolut
plithmaents· to renderc hitn conspicuous. B~
meians of this he not onlyz acquired profound

a considerable knowledg-e of the learned. lad

which had been lately revrived in Italy, and waJ
;purfured at this time w-ith great ardour. Hir
anind, however, natulrally gloomy and severe
was more formed to imbibe the four spirit o
the former, than to receivre any tina~ure of ele
g~ance or) liberality of fientiment: from the latter~
so that he acquired rather the ·qualities an
passions of a reclufSe ecclefiaftick, than the~ talent
necessary ·for the condua~ of great affairs. AG

fdeveral rich benefices were beffowed upon hire-
a~nd heb was early employed a6 nuncio in dif

that course of life, and lan guiled to be in a x s 9 9
situation more faited to his tass~e and temper.
With this viewr he resigned at once all his eccle-
fiallical preferments, and having instituted an
order of regular priests, whom he denominatedk
;Theatines, from the name of the archbi~fhoprick
iwhich he had held, he associated himfielf as a
member of their fraternity, conformed to all the
;rigorous rules to which he had fub~jeded them,
rand preferred the solitude of a monaftick life,;
'with the honour of being the founder of a new~
order, to all the vast objeats which the court of
Rome presented to his ambition.

' IN this retreat he remained for m1any pears,
until Paul Ill[. iihduced by the fame of his

inatity and knowledge, called him to Rome,
in order to consult wyith him concerning the
measu~res which might be most proper and~
.efeatual for the fupprefling of heresy , and re-
eItablifhing the ancient authority of the church.
lHaying thus allured him from his solitude, the
~Pope, partly by his entreaties, and partly by
his authority, prevailed on him to accept of a
Cardinal's hat, to re-affume the bene-fices which
~he had resigned, and. to return again into the
usual path of eccleafia~cal ambition which he
seemed to have relinlquilhedh. But, during twos
fucceffve Pontifica~tes, under thle firflF of wyhich2

the court of R~ome w-as the most artful and inter,
efted , and under the second the mnoft diffolut
of anly in Europe, Caraffa retained his n
naltick aulterity. H~e was an avowYed and bittel
enemy not only of all innovation in opinion, b
of every irregularity in pr~Aice; he was th
chief instrument in establishing the formidable
and odious tribunal of the Inquisition in the pi,
pal t~erritories; he appeared a violent advca
on2 all occafxons for the jurifdiiiion and . dild
pline of: the church, and a severe cenfpr-er
every meafalre wvhich s~eemed to flow from
tives of policy or interest, rather than from. ze
for the honour of the ecclesiastical order, a

of such a char~ader, thie Ro~man ·courtiers e

great v-ehemence against: the alliance. H~e put:
H-enry in mind how fatal to Firance every expe-
dition into Italy had been during three f~uccefiive
reigns , and if such an enterprize had proved
too great for the nation even when its firength
ande finances were entire, therte was no rneafon to
hope for faccefs, if it should be attempted now

shan his life, muff be extremely precarious, and
upon the, event: of his death, . which could not
'be d~illant, the face of things, together wvith the
inclination of the Italian States·, must instantly
change, and the whole weight of the war be
left upon the K~ing alone. To these confidera-
tions he added the near profpedt which they~
now had of a final accom~modation with the
Emperor , who having taken the res~olution of
retiring from the world , wished to ·tranfmnit his
k~ingdoms in peace to his son - and he concluded
wvith rep~refenting'the absolute certainty of draw.

with the Pope. The cardinal expeded to be I sS 5
entruffed with the conduat of the negociations

would give rife; the duke hoped to obtain the
command of the army which would be appointed
to invade N~aples ; and considering themselves
as already in these flations, vast projeAs open~ed
to their aspiring and unbounded ambition.
Their credit, together with the influence of
the King's mii~refs, the famous D~iana of Poitiers,
who was , at that time, entirely devoted to
the interest of the family of Guise, more than
counterbalanced all M/ontmorency's prudent
remonfirances , an~d prevailed on an inconfider-

unwillingnefrs to continue it. In order to rofe'

ciding concerning religious matters, which hact

been assumed by ani assembly composed chiefly BOOK 11~.

absle encroachment on that jurifdiaion which
belonged to him alone; and regarded the indul-
gence wvhich had been gi~ien to the Protestants
as an impious aa of that power wthich the

the recess of the Diet fhiould immediately be
declared illegal and void. He threatened the
Emper~or and King of the R.0mans, in cafe they
should either refuse or delay to gratify him in
this particular, with the severest effec'ts of his
vengeance. He talked in a. tone. of authority
and command which might have fa~ited a pontiff

and endeavoured to sooth him by pjutting him

and unexpedted. But while many authors have
imputed it to motives so frivolous and ~fantalli-
cal ,as canl hardly be supposed to influence' any -
reasonable mind; while others have imagined
it to be the result of some profo2und scheme of
~policy; hifforians more intelli~genti, and better
informed, neither aferibe it to caprice,nor search
for mysterious fCecrrets of state, where simple atnd
,obv6ious caus~es will fully account for the Empe-
ror's condua. Charles had been attacked early
in life with the gout, and notwithstanding all the
precautions of the moss fkcilfuil physicians, the
violence of the difteermper increa~sed a'she ad-
vanced in age, and thie fits~ became every yeat·
more frequent, as wvell as more intolerable. Not
only was the vigour of his constitution broken,
but the faculties of his minda were impaired by
the excruciating torments wrhich he endured.
During the continuance of the fits, he was alto-
gether incapable of applying to bulfinefs, and
even when they began to abate, as it was only
at intervalls that: he could attend to wha~t was f4e-
rious, he gave up a, great part of` his time to
trifling and evehn childilh ·occupations, which
served to relieve or to amuse his mind, enfleebled
and worn out wvith excess of pain. Under

to s~ustain that weighty burden. But as Philippl

can hardly be: imnputedi to the partiality of pa-

Ad brought upon her, yet; the government of Irs s
.Spinj was still velled in her jointly with the
Emperor - her na~me was ins~erted together with
his,' in all the publick wYrits issued in that king-
domn; and· fich was the fond attachment of: the
Spaniards' to her, that they wou'ld probably have
fcrup'1led to recognise Philip. as their s~overeign,
unless th~e Ihad con'ented to affamne him as her
partner on the thryone. Her utter incapacity for
business rendered it impossible to obtain her cong
sent. But her death, which happened this year
removed this difficulty; and as Charles, upon
that event , became sole: IMonarch of Spain, it
left the succession open tpo his son. T~he war
writh France h~ad likewise been a reason for re-
taining the ad~mi~~niffrat~ion of affairs in his own
hand , as he` was extremely folicitons to have
terminated it, that he might have given up his
k~ingdoms to his son at: peace with all the world .
]But as Henry had discovered no di~sposition to
close: with any of his overtures, and had even
rejected proposals of pjeace , wh~ich were equal
and moderate, in a tone that seemed to indicate
a fixed purpos~e of continuing hoffilities, he saw
that: it w~is vain toa wait longer in expectation
of an event, wh~ich, however d~efitable, was al-
together uncertain.

8po XI, iAs~ this, then , appearedt to be the p~roper~

x S h. junaure for execyting the scheme which he had

ne frma.Jon medtate, Carles refo~lvd to resign his

ahchh ki~rigdoms to his son, with a sol~emnity faitable·

sxecgted ja.to the importance of the tranfa~tion, and to per:

form this last a& of ~sovereignty with s~uch fop-
rnal pomp, as might leave a lasting imprefiron
on. the minds not only of his faibjeAs but of
his iAccef~o~r. WeTith this view he called Philip
out of England, where the peeviflh temper of
his0 Queen, which increas~ed with her desp~air of
hbaving issue ,rendered him extremely unhappy;
p nd the jealous~y of the En gliih left; him no
hopes of obtaining the direditan of their affairs.
HLaving~affembled the States oF the Low Coun.
tries at Brussels, on the twenty-fifth of Oldober,
Charles se~ated himself , for the last time·, in the·
chair of slate , on one i~de of which was placed
his son , and .A the' other his sifter the Q~ueen·
of Hungdky, regent of the Netherlands , with
a fplendidE retinue of the grandees of Spain and
princes of the Empire itanding behind him.
T~he president 'of ithe council, of Slanders , by
his command, eiplained in a few words , his
intention. in calling this extraordinary m~eeting
ps the States. H~e then read the instrument of
resignation, by which Charles fuirrender~ed to his
~fbn Philip. all. his territories, jurifdidion , antE
authority in the Low Countries , abfolvin g his

him, which he required them to transfer to s
Philip his 14 wful heir , and to serve him with the

during so long a course of years,·- in fulpport of
his government.

ing on the thoulder of the Prince of Oran ge ,

he addressed himself to tlfe audience , and from
a paper which he held in his hand , in order to
afift his memory, he recounted , with dignity ,
;but without ostentation , all the great things
which he had undertaken and performed since
th~e commencement of his adminiffration. H3e
observed ,that fr-om . the s~eventeenth year of his.
age, he had 'dedicated all his thoughts and at-
tention to publick objedis, reserving no portion
of his time for the indulgence of his ease, and
very little for the enjoyment of private pleafare;
that either in a pacifick or hostile manner, he
had visited Germany nine times , Spain fix
times, France four times, Italy seven times ,the
Low Countries ·ten times, England twice, Africa -
as often, and had made eleven voyages by sea;
that while his health permitted him to discharge
his duty , and the vigour of Ilis const~itution was
equlal, ipl any degree, to thle arduous office of

Boor XL g-overning ~such exstenfive dominions, he hade

as s.S. nevyer fhimned labour , nor repined under fatigue;

that 'now .when his health was broken, an~d his
vigour exhauited by the rage of an incurable
dilftemper, his growing infirmities adlmonifhed
him to retire , nor was he to fond of reigning,
as to retain the feeptre in an impotent hand,
which was no longer able to proted his f~ubjohs,
or ·to render them happy a that rintead of a s~o-
vereign wrorn out: with diseases, and fcarelyp half`

,alive , he gave them oneinhepmeolfeac

cuffomed already to govern, and who added to
the vigour of youth all the attention and saga-,
city of maturer years, that if , during the course
of a long adminiffration , he had committed any
m~aterial error in government, or if , under the
pressure of so many and great affairs , and amidst
the attention which he had been obliged to give
to them-, he had either negleAed or injured day
of his faubjed~s, he nlow implored their forgive-
ness; that ,for his part, he thould ever, retain a
grate~ful Cens~e of their fidelity and attachment,
and would. carry the remembrance of it along
with him to the place of his retreat , as his
fwveeteft consolation , as well as the best reward
fo~r all his services, and in his last prayers to
Almighty God would pour forth his ardent
yifhes for their wi3lfare.

THIEN turning towards Philip, who fell on his B6oOK Xf.

knees and kissed his father's hand, "If , farys IrsF 9
he, I had left you by my death this rich inhe-
ritance, to which I have made luch large addi-
.tions, some regard would have been juffly due
to my memory on that; account; but now when
1 voluntarily resign to you what I, might have
[till retained, I may well expedt the warmest
exprefii6ons of thanks on your part. W~ith
these, however, I di penfe, and shall confider
your concern for the welfare of your fubjeas,
and your love of them , as the belt and most
acceptable testimony· of your g~ratitude to me.
It is in your power, by a wife and virtuous ad-
miniffration, to juffify the extraordinary proof
which I, this day ,give of my paternal affeation,
and to demonfirate that you are worthy of the
confidence which I repos~e in you. Preserve an
inviolable regard for religion ; ·maintain the
Catholick faith in its purity; let the laws of
your country be sacred in your eyes; encroach
not on the rights and privileges of your people;
and if the time shall ever come, when you thall
wish to enjoy the tranquillity of private life ,
mayT you have a son endowed with fach qluali-

felt on this interesting occasion , as well as what

given him in charge to .speak in his name.

represented in sauch a firiking lig-hti ·the impruz-

kingdomr to- these rash obligations, and~ took
.such advantage of the absence of the Cardinal
of Lorrain , who had seduced the: King into his

fludiuating and unitead~y, and apt to be influ-
.eilced by the advice last given him, authorized
h~is· amballadors to sign a treaty of truce with
'-the Emperor for five years, on the terms which sth Fpeb

of the French m-~onarch, that he wou'ld not
allow himself to think that H-jenryF could Iforg-et

an high opinion of the Emperor's wisdom, that
he made no dclu bt of his refusing his consent: to
a truce on s~Uch unequal terms ; and on both
there accounts he confidently pronounced that
this , like 1many preceding negociations , would
terminate in nothing. But later and more cer·

ab~ruptly from RCome, he left to the Cardinal
Tournonl the dif~icult talk~ of attempting- to
sooth Paul and his nephews. T`hey were fully
sensible of the perilous situation in which they
now stood. By their; engagements with France,
which were no longer secret, they had highly
irritated Philip. T~hey dreaded the violence of
his implacable temnper. Tfhe DSuke of Alva a
,miniiter fitted~, as well by his abilities as by the
severity of his nature, for executing all Philip's
rigorouls Tchernes, had advanced from N1Pilan to

to embrace this jfavourable opportunity of fet:l

offered,· as their common father, to b~e mediator

pointed Cardinal Rebiba his nuncio to the court~i
of Brussels,- and his. nephew Cardinal Caraffa to~
that of Paris. The publijck infiredians given

that· the Pope had just cause to reproach him
with having violated the laws not onlyT of gene-

league with him, and had agreed to· the truce
of Vaucelles 3 and eager, on the other hand,
:not only to distinguish his reign by a conquest,

without fucef~s, but likewise to acquire an eftfa-

with regard to his oath, he produced-- powers-
from the Pope to absolve him from the obliT

danger which he might apprehend from t~ie~
Pope's death, he engaged that his uncle woul~
anake fach a nomination of Cardinals, as thoull
give Henry the absolute command of the next

IN order to counterbalance the effed of thei

that dignlity, togethier with the territoryr annexed

rneint of St. Laurence's martyrdom, NJot with-
ftandling the v'aft and .expensive schemes, in

even with the afiTfQtance of hais French au~xili.

grefs of the :Spanish arms, hie foresaw that., as·
fjoon as he. was deprived of their protecaion, his
territories must be over-run in a moment. Hel
remonfirated therefore with the greatest violence
ag~ainf1 the departure of the French army, re~
-proachding the duke ~of G~uise for his ill condudt,r
which had brought him into s~uch an unhappy~
fxtuation ; and comnplaining ,of the King forl

it necessary to accommodate his condual to the as s7.
exigency of his affairs, and to employ the medi-
ittion of thte V~enetians, and of Cos~mo di M~edici,
in order to obtain peace. Philip , who had
been forced unwillingly to a rupture with the
Pope, aznd~who, even while fuccef's crowned his
arms, doubted so much the juffice of his own
c~ause , that he had made frequent overtures of
pac~ificattion, listened eagerly to the firit propo-
fals of this nature from Paul, and discovered
·such moderation in his demands , as could
hardly have been expedfed from a Prince elated
with ·vidory.

confeqluence in other parts of Italy. As Philip rarnee.
was extremely solicitous to terminate his quarrel
with Paul as ~speedily as possible, he was willing
to make any s~acrifice in order to gain those
Princes, who, by joining their troops to the
Papal and French army, might have prolonged
the war. Writh this view, he entered .into a
negociation ,with Oatavio Farn·ee , duke of
Parma, and , in order to fCeduce him from his
;alliance with France , he restored to him the
city of Placentia 4 pith the territory depending
on it, which Charles V. had s~eized in the year

kept from that time in his poffefflon and had
transmitted, together with his other dominions,
to Philip.

Itabian Prmnces, that he conceived hopes of ac-
:complith~ing his favourabole ficheme of adding
:Siena and its territories to his dojcminions in
Tuscany. As his su~ccess in -this attempt de-

BO~OKXII. pended entirely on the delicacy of address wNith

as sy. which it thould be conduaed, he employed all

the refinements of policy, in the negociation.:
which he set on foot for this purpo~se. IHe began-
'with soliciting Philip, whos~e treas~ury he knew to
be entirely drained by th~e expence of the war,
to repay the great sams which he had advanced·
to the Emper~or during the siege of Siena.
'When Philip enldeavoured to elude a demand
which he was unablle to satisfy , Cosmo alffeted
to be extremely difquieted, and making no fcret:
.of his difguff, infiruaed his amnbaffado at-
Rome to open a negociation with the Pope,
wvhich seemed to be the effecS of it. The ambaf-
fador executed his comnmifllion with fa~ch dextem
rity, that Paul, imagining 'Obfmo to be entirely
alienated from the Spanifhm interest , propos~ed to
him an alliance with France , which Tihould be.
cemented by the marriage of his eldest son .to:
one of Henry's daughters. Cofmno received the.
overture with s~uch apparent fCatisfadion, ands
with so many profellions of gratitude for the
hig~h h~onour of wJhich he had the profped, that
.not only the Pope's miniff~ers, but the: French·
envoy at R~ome , talked c~onfidently , and wYith-
little reserve, of the accellion of that imlportiant
ally , as a. matter certain and decided. The
accou~nt of this yais .quickl;ycarricd to: Philip;-
and ·Cofme~, who .foresaw how: rmtich i~t w-ould·
.alkr~m hiint, had dispatched his nephewv Ludoviico

de ~Toledo into the Netherlands, that he might BOOKc XIL.
be' at hand to observe and take advantage of x s 37
his .consternation, before the first impr~efion
which it: made should in any degree abate.
Gofmo was extremely fortunate in the. choice
·of the instrument whom he employed. IToledo
waited, with patience, ~until he discovered with
certainty, that Philip had received fach intel-
ligence of his. uncle's negociations at Rome , as
must have filled his suspicious mind with fear
·and jealousy·; and then craving an audience,
he required payment of the money which had
been borrowed by the Emperor , in the most
earnest and peremptory terms. In urging that
point, he artfully threw out several dark hints
and ambiguous declarations, concer-ning the ex-
tremities to which Cofmno might be driven by
a refusal of this juff demand , as well as by
other grievances of which he had good reason
to comp amn.

Pmur P, affo~nifhed at an addres~s in such a Their fuc
fitrain, from a Princ~e so fazr his inferior as the ces.
~duke of TPufcany, and comparing~ what he now
th~ard, with the information which he had re-
~ceitred from Italy , immediately concluded that
£6fe~no had venitured to aiTume this bold ands
snufual tone on the profpe`tt of his union with
Er~ance. In o~der to prevent the Pope and
HIenry from cqui;ring~ an ally, who by his

to their conf~ederacy, he offered to grant Cofma

accepk of it: as an equivalent for the fazms due'
to him, and engag~e to furnish~ a body 'of troopsl
towards the· defence of Philip's territories iri
Italy, against any powcer who Thoukii attaclk them;
As f oon as Cosmo had brou~ght Philip to m~akie
this conceffiorn, which was the objeA of all his
artifices and intrigues, he did not protrad the
negociation by any unnecexratSry delayr,or any
exces~s of refinement, but close~d eagerly with
the propofai, and Philip, in spite of the remon-

against the Pope. By these treaties, however, 1 ss r .
the balance of -powYer among the Italian States
was poized writh greater equality, and rendered
l~ess variable than it had been. since it received
the first; vijolent shlock from the i'nvafion o~f Charles
;VIIL. of France. From- this period Italy ceased
to be thie great theatre, on which the monarchs
of Spain, France, and Germany, contended for
power or for fame. TTheir diffenflons and hof~
tilities, though as fr-equent and violent as ever,
being excited by new objeats, Rtained other re-
gions of Europe withz blood, and rendered
them mis~erable in their turn, by the devastations
of wyar.

of the kingdom. His late ill success in Italy
seemed to be ~forgotten, while his form~er ser-·
vices, particularly his defence of M&/etz, were
recount~ed with exaggerated prais~e; and he was
welcomed in every city through which he passed,
as the reff orer of publick faecurityp wtho , after

now, at the call of hais country, to check the

3~ r s 7 cept~ipn which he met with from Henry was no

lef~si cordial and honoura'ble. NCew ·titles were
invented, and new dignities created, in order to
·difinguifh him. H3e was appointed lieutenant-
g~eneral in chief both within and without the
king-dom, withl a jurifdiation almost: unlimited,

'and hardly inferior to that which was poffeffed

by the KXing himself. "Thus, through the singular
fehicity which attended the Princes of ]Lorrain,
the ~misc~arriage of their own fchermes contrib~uted
.a to aggrandize them. The calamities of his coun-
try , and the ill-conduA of his rival the Confta-
ble , .exalted the duke of G aife to a height of
dignity and power, which he could not have ex-
peded to attain by the molt fortunate and mos1

St. Oa,uintin, t~he fortifications `of wrhich· were
hitherto but imperfecily repaired.

BUT t~he durke of Guise meditated a niore we invets

imrrportant enterprize; and after amusing thme ca'a's.
enemy with threatening fiaccefirvely different B2 ss
towrns ori .the frontiers of Slanders, he turned Januaq e.'
su~ddenly to the left, and invwefted Calais with
his wYhole army.· Calais had been taken by the
English under Edward III. i'nd wras the fruit;
of that monarch's gloriouis vriaory at Crecy.
.Being the only place that they retained of their
ancient and extenlfive terr~itories in France, and
wrhich opened to them, at all times, an easy and
f~becure passage into the heart of that kingd~om,
their keeping poffetion of it soothed the pride
of the one nation as mnuch as it mortified the
vanity of th~e other. Its fitulation w~as naturallyr
so firong, and its fortifications deemed so im-y
·pregnable, that: no monarch of France, howjc
adv-enturous soever, hnad been bold enhough to
attaick it. Even wyhen the domeitick firength of
England wyas :brokhen-and exhauffed by t~he

EcorX R.I bloodyr iWars b-betwveen the hous~es of -Yorkr and

x 9 S. Lcancaiter , and its attention entii-ely diverted

from foreign objeas, Calais had rem~ainied un-
g-iflurbetd and unthreatened. Mlaryt and .her
Scouncil, ~composed chiefly of ecclefiafticks, unt
acquainmted with military affairs, and whose wihole·
arttention was turned towards extirpating heresy
o~u~t of the kingdom, had not ~only negle~ed to~
take any precautions for the safety of this im-
·pbrteant plapce, but seemed to think that the
reputation of its fir'ength alone was .fufficient
for its fCecurity. Full of this opinion, they: ven~-
.tured, even after the declaration of' wiar, to
continue a prad~ice which the low slate of the
Queen's finances had introduced in times of
peace. As the country adjacent to Calais was
overflowed during the winter, and the mad~hes
arounid it became impafnable, except by one
avenue, which the forts of St. Ag~atha and
N-ewnham-bridge commanded, it had been the
·cuffom of the English to difmits thie greater partk
of the garrison towards the end of autumn, and

Tes defence-to replace it in the spring. In vain did Lord
ne~rs saaw. Wentworth, the governor of Cala~is, remonz-

ftrate ag-ainst this ill-timed parlimony, and re-
present the pos~sibility of his :being attacked fud-
denly , while he had not-; troops f~ufficient to
man the works. The ··privy-council treated
there3 remonfira-nces with s~corn ,as if they h-ad

flowed from the timidity or the rapacioufnlefs of BOOK 111,
tshe governor ; and some of them , with that - x Ss .
confidence which is the, companion of ignorance,
boalited that they would defend Calais with
their white rods againlL any enemy who thpulde
approach it during winter ". In vain did Philip,
who had p~assed through Calais as he returned
from England to the Nfretherlands , warn the
Queen of the danger to which it: was exposed;
and acquainting her with what was necessary
for its security, in vain did he offer to reinforce
the garrison during winter with a detachment
oss his owyn troops. Mlary's codunfellors, thoughl
obsequious to her in all points wherein religion
was concerned , difirufted, as much as the reft;
of their countrymen, every propolition that
came from her- hufb~ad;an ; andfupedting this to -
be an artifice of Philip's, in order to gain the
command of the town, they negledted his in-
telligence, declined his offer, and left C~alais
with let's than a fourth of the men requilite for
its defence.

ITr was his knowledge of th~is wihich en- Guifb pushes

coura ~ed the duke of Guise to venture on an the nege,,

his cotmtrymen, far above all thle genrerals of

gave vent to all the pallions, which animate a

calamity is manifestly owing to the ill condua~
of their rulers. IMary and her miniffers , for-

Bo100K XII. THE Frenich King imitated the conduat of
rgr8. its former conqueror, Edwar~d TIII with re-

gard to Calais. He co~mmanded !all the En gilh
inhabitahts to quit the town, and giving their:
houses to his own f~ubjedts, ~whom he. allured to:
fettle there by granting them various immu.
mities, he left a numerous garri~o~n, under an~
experienced governor, for their defence. After
this, his viAorious army went into quartlrs of
refr·eshment,, and thte usu~al inadltion 'of winter
r~et~urned.

~,,~ -r. DuRNns these varrious operations, Ferdinand
Charles's assembled the colleg~e of Eledors at Frankfort,

'"' ;i~ih order to lay before them the deed whereby

rer an Charles 'V. had resigned the Irisperial crown, and

-Sw" tranzsf~erred it t~o" himx. This h~e had h-litherto de*

layed on account of some difficulties which had
occurred concerning the formalities requisite In
Eupplying a vacancy occasioned· by an event, to
which there was no parallel in dbe annals of the
Empire. T~hese being at length adjuffed, the
Prince of Orange executed the comamillion with
which he had been entruffed by Charles ; the
Eledors accepted of his resignation ; declared
Fierdinand his lawful faucceffor; and put him.
in poffefflon of all the enlignis of the Imperia~l
digruty.

But when the new Emperor sent GufTman Boon MEg
his chancellor, to acquaint the Pope with this ,s
tranfadion , to teltify his reverence tovairds the The Pope
Holy See, and to signify that, according to rtunre t~o
form, he would soon dispatch an ambaffaidOfledge Ferdia
extraordinary to treat: with his holinefs~oncern- nan" as
ing his coronation;; Paul, whom neither expe-e .0P
rience nor difatppointntents could teach to bring
down his lofty ideas of the papal p~rerogative
to fulch a moderate flandard as faited the gemius
of the times, refused to admit the envby~ i~nto
his presence, and declared all the proceedings
at' F~rankfo~rt irregular and invalid. He con-
tended that the Pope, as the vicegerent of Christ,
was entruff~ed; with ·the keys both of celestial
and terrestrial government; that from him the>
Imperial jurif~diaEion zwas derived; that though
his predecessors hadl authorized the EleAdrrs to
chu-fe an Emperor whom the Holy See con-
firmed ,this privilege was con~fined to those cafes
w~hen a vacancy was occafionded by death ;that
the infirument of Charles's resignation had beenm
pres~ented in an improper court, as it belonged
to th'e Pope alone to rejea or to accept of it, and
to nominate a person to fill the Imperial throne;
that, Ltting aside all there obje~aions, Ferdi-
nand's elea~ion laboured under two defeas
which aelo'ne were f~ufficient: to render'it void, for
the Prtoteftant Eled~ors had been atdmitted to

Swon XIL. vote,, though by their apoffacy from the catho.

az-5. lick faith, they had forfeited that and every other

privilege of the` eledtoral office; and Ferdinand,l
~by ratifying the concessions of several Dgiet~s in
-favour. of heret~i~ks, had readered himself un;
worthy ps the Imperial dignity, which was in:
£tituted for the protedtion, not for the de~f~rue
teion of the church. But,. after thundering out
these extravagant maxims, he added with an
appearance of condefcenflon, that if Ferdinand
wveuld Atnounce all title to the Imperial. crown,
founde~d on the eleation at Frankfort, make
profefilons of repentance for his past condud~,:
and fupgplicat-e him , with due humility , to comi
firm Charles's resignation , as well as his alliump.
tion to the Empire; he might exped every
r.~nagk of .favour from his paternal .clemency and
goodness. Gufmas, though he had foref~eeni
-considerable difficulties in his neg-ociation wit~

xIS38. a treaty, as it increased his imnpatience for r·el

turning into Spain, where there was now no per,
son greater or more illuffrious than hims~elf. But~,
in spite of the concurring with-es of all the par-
ties interefied , an event happened which occa.
fioned an unavoidable delaiy in thqeir negcia,
tions. About a month after the opening of the
conferences at Cercamp, Mary of England ended

Nov. ~rr. her short and inglorious reign, and Elizabeth
neaa r of her fiffer was immediately proclaimed Queen by
Eingland. the. Engliifh with universal joy, Ahs the powers

of the Efnglifh plenipotentiaries expired on the
death of their miffrefs, they could not proceed
until they recei~ved· a commit~ion and infirue
tions from their new frovereign.

WoRIIT ana HKENRY and Philip behield Elizabeth's eleva·
raiin, court tion to the throne w-ith equal solicitude. As
~~Edz"" during Mary's jealous adminiffration , under the
for. ;most; diffcul~t circumstances , and, in a situation

extremely delicate, that Princess had conduated
herse~lf with prudence and address far exceeding·
her yea~s, they had conceived an high idea of
her abilities , and already formed expetat~ions of
a reign very different from that of her fifer.
]Equally fe~nfble of the importance of gaining
her favour , both- mnonarchs set thems~elves with
egmulation to court it, and employed every art

3cA order to insinuate themselves into her con- B3oox; XII.
fidence. Each of them had s~omething merito- x ss8.
riouis, writh regard to Elizabeth , to plead in his
own behalf. Henry had onffered her a retreat:
in his dom~inions, if the dread of her fi;er's
violence should force her to fly for ~safety out:
of Englan~d. Philip, by his powerful intercer-
flion, had prevented MI~ary from proceeding to
the most~ fatal extremities against her. Each of
-thema endeavoured now- , to' avail hims8elf of the
circumstances in his favour. Henry wrote to
Elizabet~h soon after her accet~ion , writh the:
warmest expreiffions of regard and friendship.
He reprefeated the war wh~tich had unhappily
·been kindled between their kingdoms, not as a
national quarrel, but as the effedt of M9/ary's
blind partiality to her husb8and and fond com-
pliance with all his 'wifhpis. He entreated her
to dis~engage herself from an alliance which had
prov~ed so unfortunate to England, and to con-
feat to a separate peace with him, without mlin-
gling her interef~s with those of Spain, from
which they ought now to be altogether disjoined.
Philip, on the other hand, unwilling to 10fe his
connexion with En gland , the importance of
wvhich, during a rupture wyith France, he· had
so recently experienced, not: only vied with
Henry in· declar~ations of effeem for Elizabeth-,

ed himself to her in marriage , and undertook,
to procure a dispensation from the Pope to that.

Eiizabeth's ELIZABETH weighed the~ propos~als of: the two~
~ede:nbera- ]Wnarch~s attentively ,. and with that provident
c~erning her difceralenmen of her true interest whic~h was conr-
UOn"u" fpicuous in -all her ~ deliberations.· She gave

some encouragement to Hienry's overture of a
se~parate negociation, because it opened a chran-
nel of correspondence with France, which the
migoht: find to be of great adviantage , if Phili~p
th~ould not dilcover faffficient zeal and solicitude
for fecurilig to her , proper terms in the joint
treaty. But the ventured ion this fiep with the
most cautious reserve, that the might not alarin
Philip's suspicious temper, and 10f~e an ally7 in at-
tempting to gain an enemy ". Hfenrr ]hirnfelf,
by an unpardonable aB of indifereti0n , pre-
vented her from carrying her intercourse witha
him to such a length as might have osffended or
alienated Philip. At the very time? when he
was courting Elizabethn's friendship with th~e
greateR afidiuity , he yielded with an inconfi--
d~erate facility to the folicitationrs of the Pritices
of Ldr-rain, and allowved his daughter-indawv

tak~en their r·esolution with unalterable firmnnef~s.
Philip warmly supported Elizabeth's preten-
flon to Calais, not merely from a principle of
equity towvards the English nation , that he
mnight appear to have contributed toe their reco-
vering what they had loft by espousing his
caus~e; nor solely with a view of soothing Eliza-
beth by: this manifestation of zeal for her in-
t~erest; but in order to render France leffs formi-
dable', by securing to her ancient enemy this
easy acces~s into the heart of the kingdomn. The

open and vigorous measures not only for over-
turning all that her Gfifer had done in favour
of popery, but for establish~ing the Protestant
church on a firm foundation , as convinced
Ph~ilip that his hopes of an union with her had
been from the beginning vain , and were now
desperate. From that; period, his interpofitions
'in her favour became mo1re3 cold and formal,
flowing merely from regard to decorum , or
from the consideration of remote political in-
terefts. Elizabeth, having reafkon to exped such
an alteration in his condlue, quickly perceived
it. But as nothing would have been of greater
detriment to her people ,or more inconsistent
with her schemes of domeltic adminiftratioh,
than the continuance of war , the saw the
necefffity of fubrmitting to such conditions as
the situation of her affairs imposed , and
that the muff reckon upon being deserted by

jin expedient was fallen upon , which, in fTome· BOOK XIL
degree ,juffified Elizabeth's departing from the r>599
rigour of her first demand with regard to Calais.
A~ll leffbr articles were fCettled without much
ditcuffion or d~elay. Philip , that he might not
appear to have abandoned the ]English , ins ifted
that the treaty between H~enry and Elizabeth
thlould be concluded in form, before that bel
tween the French monarch and him. T8he one,
was signed on the second day of April , the other
ona the day following.

THE treaty of peace between France and Eng- Artices or
land contained no articles of real importance, veace e-
but that which refpefled Calais. It was fli~pu France ann
lated; THhat: the King of France thould r~etain England.
.poffefion of that town, with all its dependen-
cies, during eight years; ~That, at the expiration
of that term, he should reffore it to England;
That: in cafe of non-performance, he thould
forfeit five hundred thousand crowns for the
payment of which f~um, ~seven or eight wealthy
merchants, who were not his fatbjeats, should
.grant fCecurityT ; That five persons of diftin-Aion
thould be given as hoffages until that fCecurity~
were provided; T~hat although the forfeit of
five huindred thousand crowns should be paid,
the right ofEnglapd to Calais sh~ould still remain-
enltire in thae fCame manner as if the term of

BfOOK 111. eight years were expired; That the King and

a s 9. Qrueen of Scotland thould be includ ed in the

treaty; T~hat if they , or the French K~ing, thlould
violate the peace by any hoffile ad5ion, Henry
tlhould be obliged inflantly to reftiore Calais;
That on the other hand, if any breach of the
treaty proceeded from Elizabeth , then Henry
and the K~ing and Queen of Scots were absolved-
from all the engagements which they had come:
under by this treaty.

nhe views of NJO TWIITHSTANDING the studied attention with~
both parties which so many precautions were taken , it is
70 t ~"a evident that Henry did not intend the restitution

of Calais, nor is it probable that Elizabeth exi
peded it. It was hardly possible that the could
maintain , during the course~ of eight years , such
perfedt concord both with France and Scotland,
as not to afford H~enry some pretext for alleg-
ing that she hi~d violated the treaty. ButC even
if tha~t term fehould elapse without any ground~
for coniplaint , Henry might then chufe to pay
the fum stipulated, and Elizabeth had no rne·
·thoc~- of asserting her right but: by force of arms.
However, by throwing the articles in the treaty!
with regard to Calais into this form , Elizaboeth

, ftisfied her fabjec~s of ever-y denomination~;

tehe gave men of- discernment a. firiking proof
of her addiefs , in palliating what she could not

prevent; and amufedf the multitude , to whom BOOKr XII,
th~e cellion of faich an important place would ,5E9.
have ~appeared altogoether infamous , with the
profpedt of recovering in a thort time that fa-
vourite poff~effion.

'THE expedient; which M~ontmorency employ- An expedi
ed , in order to facilitate the conclusion of peace ent which

between France and Spain, was the negociating peace be-
two treaties of marriage, one b~etween Eliza-tween France and
beth,, jHenry's eldest~ daughter, and Philip, who spain.
fupplanded his fonl, the unfortunate Donl Carlos,
to whom that Princess h~ad been promised in
the ~former conferences at C~ercarap; the other
, be~tween Marg~aret, Henry's only sifter, and
the Duke of Savoy. For feeble as the ties of
blood often" are among Princes, or how little
soever they may regard them when pushed on
to *ad by motives of ambition, they assume onl
other occaflons the appearance of being so far
influenced by these domneftick aff`eaions, as to
employ them to juffify measures and concefflons
·which they find to be necessary, but know toj
be irnipolitick ' or dishonourable. Such was the
d~e Henry made of the two marriag-es to which
he, gave his conf~eat.' Havia g fe curedi an ho-

the vast territories which def~cendeid to, Charles
from his Auffrian, Burgundian, and Spanish
anceffors "8. T~o the.C he: himfielf added the am-
·rperaia digni;ty; and, as if all this had been too
little , the bounds of the habitable globe feemedl
to be extended, and a newe worl'd was fubjeted
,to· his ·command. Upon his resignation , the
yf~urguzndian provinces , and the Spanilh king-
doms ·with their dependencies , both in the told
and new, worlds, devolved to Philip. Bu-t Charles
.trans~mitted his dominions to his son, in a con-
dition very different from that in wvhich he had
received them, JThey were augmented by thme
accellion of new provinces ; they were habituated
to obey an adminiffration which was no less vi-
~gorous than Rteady; they ye-re accuf'tomned to
expensive and persevering efforts, which, thou~gh
necessary in the contests between civilized na·
tions, had been little known in Europe before
Ithe sixteenth century. The: prov~inces of Fries~
land, Utrecht, and Overyffel.tiwhich he acquired

thme dutchy of Gueldres, of wyhich he made him.o

b3y the arts of negdciation, w~er~e add~itions ofp
great value to his Burgundiani dolninions. Ser-
dinandi and Iitabei,4a had tran~im~itted. to &im al

Pyrenees` to the frontiers of Portugal; but as h
maintained a perpetual peace wvith that king;
dom, amidst the various efforts of his enterprit
ing ambition, he made no acquisition of territor)
in that quarter.

Pnracularly CHARLEs had gained, however, a vast acceffiah
in spain. oDf power in this part of; his dominions. By hks

success in the war with the commons oE· Castile,
'he exalted -the regal prerogative upon the ruins
of the privileges which formerly belonged to the
~people. Though he allowed the name of th~e
Cortes to remain, and the formality of holdingit
to be continued , he reduced its authority and ju.
rifdi~tion to nothing, and modelled it in such a
manner, that it became rather a junto of the ser.
vants of the crown, than an affemnbly of the repre·
fentatives of the people. One member of the
cosnflitution being thus lopped of , it was impot
filble but that the other must feel the ifroke, and
·fuffer by it. The fupprefi~on of the popular power
rendered the ariffocratical less form~idable. The
grandees, prompted by the warlike sp~irit of (he
age , or allured by the honours w~hich they enjoy·
ed in a court, exhauffed their fortunes in militarti
service, or in attending on the person of thdsf
Prince: They did not dread, perhaps did not
observe, the dangerous progress of the royal au·

of being cove-red in presence of their foi~vereign,
firipped them, by degrees, of that ~real power!
which they poffelled while they formed one boody·,
and aded in concert with the people. Charles's
fazccef~s in abolifting the privileges of the comn-
mons, and in breaking .the power of the nobles
of Castile ,encouraged Philip to invade the liberg-
ties of A ragon, which were ftlil more extensive.
The Caffilians , accuffomed to fabjeAion them-
selves, assisted in imposing· the yoke on their
more happy and independent neighbou'rs. TJhe
will of the sovereign becamae the fopreme lawY·
in all the kingdoms of Spain ; and princes w-ho.
were not checked in forming their plans by the
jealou~y of the people , nor controled in exe-
cuting them by ·the power of the nobles , could
both aim at great objeats, and call forth the
whole fkrength of the monarchly in order to
,attain themn.

·these additional f'ecurities against ext~ernal inva-
sion, must be deemed the most powerful king;-

ated than any on the Continent either for· con-
quest or defe~nce. From the confines of Artois
to the bottom of the Pyrenees, and from the
British channel to· the frontiers of Savoy and
the coast of the Mlediterranean, its territories
lay compadt and unmingled with those of any
other power. Seve~ral of the considerable pro-
vinces, which had contradted a fpIirit of inde-
pendence by their having been long fubjeaS to
the great vassals of the crown , who1~ were often
at,variance or at war with their- master, were

Boost XI`I farne mona~rchy, they afilmed the s~entiments of:

that· body into which they: were incorporatedl,
and co-o~perated with zeal towards. promoting:
its 'intereft and honour. The power and infla.·
ence wrefied from the nobles were seized by thej
crown. The people were not admitted to thare'
in there flpoils; they gainaed no new privilege-;:
they acquir~ed no additional wceight in the legist·
lature. It ·was not for the fatke of th-e pedple,
but in order to' extend their own prerogativre,
that the monarchs of France had ·laboured ~to
humble their great vassals. Satisfied with having

were hardly acquainted with any pastime or
exercise but ~what was military ; and who knew
no road to power, or fame, or wealth-, but war,
would not have fuffered, their sovereign to re-
main long in ina~ion. The people, little ac-
quainted with the arts of peace, and always
ready to t~ake arms at the command of their
sup eriors, were accuff omed by the vast expence
of long wrars, carried on in diftinat countries,
to bear impolitiorns, which, however inconfi-
derable they may seem if esti~mated by the exor-
bitant rate of modern exa~tions, appear im-
mense wvhen compared with the sums levied in
F~rance , or in any other country of Europe ,
previous to the reign of Louis XI[. As all the
menabers of which the state was compos~ed were
thus impatient for action, and capable of great
efforts, the schemes and operations of France
must have been no less· formidable to Europe
than those of Spain. The superior advantages
of its' situation , the contiguity andi compaatnef~s
of its territories, together with the peculiar~
state ·of its political, confitution at that junaure,

'fw ~ the power of such a monarchy might have been,

the `civi-l wars which broke out in France saved
them at that jundture from feeling its effeas.
These wars, of which religion was the pretext:
and ambition the cause , wherein great abilities
were displayed by the leaders of the differenlt
-IFad~ians , and. little conduat or firmness were
mranifefied by. the crown under a fauccetiion of
·weak Princes, kept France occupied and etn-
broiled for half a century. During there corn-

·motions the internal firength of the kingdom BOOKS I·1I.
was much wafeted, and such a sp~irit of anarchy
was spread among the Eobles, to whom rebellion
?was familiar , and the reffraint of laws unknown,
that a considerable interval became` requisite
not only for recruitring the internal vigour of
the nation, but for re-efi~ablifhing the authoritypt
of the Prince; so that it was long before Firance
could turn her whole attention towards foreign
tranfa~tions, or adt with her proper force in
foreign- wars. It was long before the rose to
that as~cendant in Europe which the has main-
~tained finces the adminiffration of Cardinal RBiche-

together with the charadier of her people, ea-
title her to maintain.

W~HI~LE the kingdoms ~on the continent greW progrees of

into power and consequence, Eng~land likewise aEnglnd
made considerable progress towards regular go-, jto inte.
vernment and interior firength. Henry VIII~rior n~ate
'probably without intention, and certainly w-ith-
out any consistent plan , of which his nature
was incap~able, pursued the s~cheme· of depref-
sing the nobility , which the policy of his father
Henry VII. had begun. T~he pride and caprice
of his temiper· led him to employ chiefly new
men in the administration of aiffairs,, because he

:BQoom XII. found ~thent~ roRt obsequious, or least fcrups.

10us a and he not only conferred on them fTuch
plenitude of power , bu exalted -them to such
pre-eminence in dignity , as mortified and de·
graded the ancient nobility. By the alienation
or sale of the church- lands, wc~hich were diffi.
pated with a profullon not inferior to the rapa.
diounef~s with which they had been seized, ais
wIell as by the privilege granted to the ancient
landholders of f~elling their estates, or disposing
of them by will, an imnmenfe property, formerly
locked up , was brought into circulation. This
put the spirit of induffry and commerce in
·-miotion, and gave it some considerable degree
of vigour. THhe road to power and to opulence
became open to persons of every condition.
~A sudden and excetfive fllow off wealth from the
*Weft -Indies prov·ed fatal to induff ry in Spain;
-a moderatte accetfion in England to the fum iti
circulation gave life to commerce, awyakenedi
the ingenuity of the nation, and excited it to
ulfeful enterprize. In France, what the nobles
loft, the crown gained. In England, the com-
mnons were gainers as well as the King. Power
and influence accompani~ed of course the pro-
pert'y which they acquired. They ro~se to con·
fideration among their fellow - subjeCts; they
began t~o feel their own importance; and ex-

.high authority , to which the Britith conflitution
is indebted for the existence, and muff ~owpe the
preservation of its liberty. At the .fame time
that the English constitution advancced towards;
perfeation, s~everal circumstances brought on a
change in the aud~ient fryfiem with ref~pedl to
foreign powers, and introduced another more
beneficial to the nation. As soon as Henry
giicdaimed the fopremacy of the Papal See, and
broke off all connexion with the P-apal court,
consi~derable sums were saved to the nation, of
wvhich it had been annually' drained, by remit-
tances to Rome for difpEenfations and indul-

yoke, and conferred the regal dignity on~ its
deliverer Gustavus E~ricson, 'who had all the
virtues of a liero and of a patriot. Denmark,
exhauffed by foreign wyars, or weakened by the
dillenflons betwieen the King and the nobles,
became incapable of such efforts as were requi-
lite in order to recover the afcenciant .which it
had long poff~effed in the North of Eiurope.
Sweden,, as soon as it was freed from the domi-
nion of firangers, began to recruit its firength,
and acquired in a thor t time fach interior vigour,
that it became the firlt kingdom in the North.
Early in the subsequent century, it rose to furch
a high rank' among the powers of Europe, that
it had the chief merit in forming as well as con-
duating that powerful league, which proteated
pot only the Protestant religion , but the liber,
ties of Germany against the bigotry and. ambnis
tion of the house of 1Auffria,
