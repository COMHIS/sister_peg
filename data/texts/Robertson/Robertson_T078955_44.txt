# PREFACE.

PREFACE.
rHE perusal of Major Rennell's Memoir for

illustrating his Map of Indoftan, one of the

most valuable geographical treatises that h.- . ap-
peared in any agc or country, gave rife tc the fol-
lowing work. It suggested to me the idea of
examining more fully than I had done in the In-
trodutory Book to my History of America, into
the knowledge which the Ancients had of India,
and ofconfidering what is certain, what is obscure,
and what is fabulous, in the accounts of that coun-
try which they have handed down to us. In un-
dertaking this inquiry, I had originally no other
objec than my own amusement and inftruftion:
But in carrying it on, and consulting with dili-
gence the authors of antiquity, some facds, hi-
therto unobserved, and many which had not been
examined with proper attention, occurred; new
views opened; my ideas gradually extended and
became more interesting; until, at length, I ima-
gined that the result of my researches might
prove amusing and inftru&tive to others, by ex-
hibiting such a view of the various modes in

A 2 which

which intercourse with India had been carried on
from the earliest times, as might ihew how much
that great branch of commerce has contributed,
in every age, to increase the wealth and power of
the nations which possessed it.

THUS the Historical Disquisition which I now

lay before the Reader was begun and completed.
What degree of merit it pofleffes, the Public
muff determine. My grateful recolletion of the
favourable manner in which my other works have
been received, naturally increases the solicitude
with which I wait for its decision concerning this
which I now publish.

WHEN I first turned my thoughts to this sub-

jce, I was so fully aware of the disadvantage
under which I laboured in undertaking to de-
scribe countries of which I had not any local
knowledge, that I have been at the utmost pains
to guard against any errors which this might oc-
cafion. I have consulted, with persevering in-
duftry, the works of all the authors I could pro-
cure, who have given any account of India; I
have never formed any decided opinion, which
was not supported by refpe&table authority j and
as I have the good fortune to reckon among the
number of my friends some Gentlemen who have
filled important fations, civil and military, in

I o India,

India, and who have visited many different parts
of it, I had recourse frequently to them, and from
their conversation learned things which I could
not have found in books. Were it proper to
mention their names, the Public would allow
that by their discernment and abilities they are
fully entitled to the confidence which I have
placed in them.

IN the progress of the work, I became fenfi-

ble of my own deficiency with refpe& to an-
other point. In order to give an accurate idea of
the imperfection both of the theory and practice
of navigation among the Ancients, and to explain
with scientific precision, the manner in which
they ascertained the position of places, and cal-
culated their longitude and latitude, a greater
portion of mathematical knowledge was requi-
site, than my attention to other studies had per-
mitted me to acquire. What I wanted, the
friendship of my ingenious and refpetable Col-
league, Mr. Playfair, Professor of Mathematics,
has supplied; and I have been enabled by him to
elucidate all the points I have mentioned, in a
manner which, I am confident, will afford my
Readers complete fatisfation. To him, like-
wife, I am indebted for the conftrucion of two
maps necessary for illustrating this Disquisition,
which without his afiftance I could not have
undertaken.

I HAv£

I HAVE adhered, in this work, to an arrange-

ment I followed in my former compositions, and
to which the Public has been long accustomed.
I have kept historical narrative as much separate
as possible from scientific and critical difcuflions,
by reserving the latter for Notes and Illustrations.
I flatter myself that I may claim, without pre-
fumption, the merit of having examined with
diligence what I submit to public infpe&ion,
and of having referred, with scrupulous ac-
curacy, to the authors from whom I have derived
information.

A N
HISTORICAL DISQUISITION

CONCERNING
ANCIENT INDIA.

S E C T IO N I.
Intercourse with India, fiom the earliefl Timesj

until the Conquest of Egypt ly thez Romans.
W' 1 OEVER attemFts to trace the ope- s E C T.

rations of men in remote times, and

to mark the various steps of their progress
in any line of exertion, will soon have the
mortification to find, that the period of au-
thentic history is extremely limited. It is lit-
tle more than three thouland years since the
Books of MoTes, the most ancient and only
genuine record of what palsed in the early
ages of the world, were comrpored. Herodo-
tus, the most ancient H-athcn hiiforian whole
works have reached us, f.ourilhed a tloufand

,s)~ ~ years

S E C T. years later. If we push our inquiries concern-
4-., . ing any point beyond the aura where written

history commences, we enter upon the region
of conjecture, of fable, and of uncertainty.
Upon that ground I will neither venture my-
self, nor endeavour to conduct my readers.
In my researches concerning the intercourse
between the Eastern and Western regions of
the earth, and concerning the progress of that
great branch of trade, which, in every age,
has contributed so conspicuously towards raising
the people who carried it on, to wealth and
power, I fllall confine myself within the pre-
cincts I have marked out. Wherever the in-
spired writers, intent upon higher objects,
mention occasionally any circumstance that tends
to illustrate the subjet of my inquiries, I ihall
attend to it with reverence. \Whatever other
writers relate, I ihall examine with freedom,
and endeavour to ascertain the degree of credit
to which they are entitled.

THE original flation allotted to man by his

Creator, was in the mild and fertile regions of
the Eafr. There the human race began its
career of improvement; and from the remains
of iciences which were anciently cultivated, as
well as of arts which were anciently exercised in
India, we may conclude it to be one of the
frft countries in which men made any cdnfi-

derable

derable progress in that career. The wisdom s.E c T.
of the East was early celebrated , and its pro--
duRions were early in requetl among distant
nations b. The intercourse, however, between
different countries was carried on at first en-
tirely by land. As the people of the East ap-
pear Goon to have acquired complete dominion
over the useful animals', they could early un-
dertake the long and toilsome journies which
it was necessary to make, in order to maintain
this intercourfc ; and by the provident bounty
of Heaven, they were furnilhed vith a beast
of burden, without whose aid it would have
been impossible to accomplish them. The
Camel, by its persevering strength, by its mo-
deration in the use of food, and the singularity
of its internal ftruiture, which enables it to
lay in a stock of water sufficient for several
days, put it in their power to convey bulky
commodities through thole deserts, which must
be traversed by all who travel from any of the
countries weft of the Euphrates towards India.
Trade was carried on in this manner, parti-
cularly by the nations near to the Arabian
Gulf, from the earliest period to which his-
torical information reaches. Distant journies,
however, would be undertaken at first only

X; occasionally,

st c r. occasionally, and by a few adventurers. But

1 z. ;by degrees, from attention to their mutual safety

and comfort, numerous bodies of merchants
assembled at stated times, and fcrming a tem-
porary association, (known afterwards by the
name of a Caravan,) governed by officers of
their own choice, and subjea to regulations of
which experience had taught them the utility,
they performed journies of such extent and du-
ration, as appear astonishing to nations not accuf-
tomed to this mode of carrying on commerce.

BUT, notwithstanding every improvement

that could be made in the manner of convey-
ing the productions of one country to another
by land, the inconveniences which attended
it were obvious and unavoidable. It was often
dangerous; always expensive, and tedious, and
fatiguing. A method of communication more
easy and expeditious was fought, and the in-
genuity of man gradually discovered, that the
rivers, the arms of the fca, and even the ocean
irfelf, were defined to open and facilitate in-
tercourfe vwih the various regions of the earth,
between which they appear, at first view, to
be placed as inilperable barriers. Navigation,
however, and flip-building, (as I have ob-
fcrvcei in another work d,) are arts so nice and

complicated, that they require the talents as s E C ?T
well as experience of many fucceflive ages, to _-_
bring them to any degree of perfeEtion. From
the raft or canoe, which first served to carry a
savage over the' river that obftru&ed him in
the chace, to the confl:rucion of a vessel ca-
pable of conveying a numerous crew, or a con-
fiderable cargo of goods, to a distant coast,
the progress of improvement is immense. Many
efforts would be made, many experiments
would be tried, and much labour as well as
ingenuity would be employed, before this ar-
duous and important undertaking could be ac-
complifhed.

EVEN after some improvement was made in

ship-building, the intercourse of nations with
each other by sea was fir from being extensive.
From the accounts of the earliest historians,
we learn, that navigation made its first efforts
in the Mediterranean and the Arabian Gulf,
and in them the first active operations of com-
merce were carried on. From an attentive in-
fpeftion of the position and form of these two
great inland seas, these accounts appear to be
highly probable. These seas lay open the con-
tinents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and spread-
ing to a great extent along the coasts of the
most fertile and most early civilized countries
in each, seem to have been destined by nature

B3 to

S E c T. to facilitate their communication with one ano-

ther. We find, accordingly, that the firit voy-
ages of the Egyptians and Phenicians, the most
ancient navigators mentioned in history, were
made in the Mediterranean. Their trade, how-
ever, was not long confined to the countries
bordering upon it. By acquiring early posses-
sion of ports on the Arabian Gulf, they extend-
ed the sphere of their commerce, and are re-
presented as the first people of the Weft who
opened a communication by Tea with India.

IN that account of the progress of navigation

and discovery which I prefixed to the History
of America, I confidered with attention the mari-
time operations of the Egyptians and Phenicians;
a brief review of them here, as far as they relate
to their connection with India, is all that is requi-
site for illustrating the subjet of my present in-
quiries. With ref)pet to the former of there peo-
ple, the information which history affords is
slender, and of doubtful authority. The fertile
foil and mild climate of Egypt produced the ne-
ceffaries and comforts of life in such profusion,
as to render its inhabitants so independent of
other countries, that it became early an efta-
blifhid maxim in their policy, to renounce all
intercourse with foreigners. In consequence
of this, they held all fca-faring perfuns in de-

teftation,

tcftation, as impious and profane; and fortify- s E C T.
ing their harbours, they denied strangers admif- *,
sion into them'.

THE enterprising ambition of Sefoftris, dif-

daining the restraints imposed upon it by there
contracted ideas of his subje&s, prompted him
to render the Egyptians a commercial people;
and in the course of his reign, he so completely
accomplished this, that (if we may give credit
to some Historians) he was able to fit out a
fleet of four hundred (hips in the Arabian Gulf,
which conquered all :he countries stretching
along the Erythrean Tea to India. At the fame
time, his army, led by himself, marched through
Atia, and fubjeted to his dominion every part
of it as far as to the banks of the Ganges; and
crossing that river, advanced to the Eastern
Ocean'. But these efforts produced no per-
manent effecl, and appear to have been so
contrary to the genius and habits of the Egyp-
tians, that, on the death of Sefoftris, they resumed
their ancient maxims, and many ages elapsed
before the commerc!al connection of Egypt

_ ,

THE hifory of the early maritime operations

of Phenicia are not involved in the fame ob-
fcurity with those of Egypt. Every circum-
stance in the charac-er and fituanion cf the Phe-
nicians, was favourable to the commercial Ipirit.
The territory which they poffiffcd, was neither
large nor fertile. It was from commerce only,
that they could derive either opulence or power.
Accordingly, the trade carried on by the Phe-
nicians of Sidon and Tyre, was extensive and
adventurous and, both in their manners and
policy, they refernble the great commercial
hiates of modern times, more than any people in
the ancient world. Among the various branches
of their commerce, that with India may be re-
garded as one of the most considerable and most
lucrative. As by their situation on the Medi-
terranean, and the imperfeE& fate of navigation,
they could not attempt to open a direEt com-
munication with India by sea; the enterprizing
spirit of commerce prompted them to wrest
from the Idumreans fcme commodious har-
bours towards the bottom of the Arabian Gulf.
From there they held a regular intercourfq

with

with India on the one hand, and with the Eastern S E c T.
and Southern coasts of Africa on the other. .-
The difrance, however, from the Arabian Gulf
to Tyre was considerable, and rendered the
conveyance of goods to it by land carriage so
tedious and expensive, that it became neceflary
for them to take possession of Rhinocolura,
the nearest port in the Mediterranean to the
Arabian Gulf. Thither all the commodities
brought from India, were conveyed over land
by a route much fiorter, and more practi-
cable, than that by which the productions of the
East were carried at a subsequent period from
the opposite shore of the Arabian Gulf to the
Nile h. At Rhinocolura, they were reshipped,
and transported by an easy navigation to Tyre,
and distributed through the world. This, as
it is the earliest route of rtnunication with
India, of which we have any authentic defcrip-
tion, had so many advantages over any ever
known before the modern discovery of a new
course of navigation to the Eafl, that the Phe-
nicians could supply other nations with the pro-
ductions of India in greater abundance, and at
a cheaper rate, than any people of antiquity.
To this circumstance, which, for a considerable
time, secured to them a monopoly of that

trade,

s r c trade, was owing, not only the extraordinary
L-~- wealth of individuals, which rendered the

" merchants of Tyre, Princes, and her traf-
" ficecrs the Honourable of the Earth i' but
the exrenfive power of the state itself, which
firit taught mankind to conceive what vast re-
sources a commercial people possess, and what
great exertions they are capable of making k.

THE Jews, by their vicinity to Tyre, had

fich an opportunity of observing the wealth
which flowed into that city from the lucrative
commerce carried on by the Phenicians from
their settlements on the Arabian Gulf, as incited
them to aim at obtaining some share of it.
This they effected under the prosperous reigns
of David and Solomon, partly by the conquests
which they made of a small diftricó in the land
of Edom, that gave them poffcffion of the har-
bours of Elath and Efiongeber on the Red
Sea, and partly by the friendship of Hiram, king
of Tvre; who enabled Solomon to fit out fleets,
which, under the direction of Phenician pilots,
failed to Tarshish and Ophir'. In what re-
gion of the earth we fliould search for these

of Solomon with the various commodities enu- s E C T.
merated by the sacred historians, is an inquiry _

-

that has long exercised the industry of learned
men. They were early fizppofed to be situated
in fame part of India, and the Jews were held
to be one of the nations which tracid with that
country. But the opinion more generally adopt-
ed is, that Solomon's fleets, after pafling the
firaits of Babelmandeb, held their course along
the south-west coast of Africa, as far as the
kingdom of Sofala; a country celebrated for
its rich mines of gold and silver, (from which
it has been denominated the Golden Sofala by
Oriental writers",) and abounding in all the
other articles which composed the cargoes of the
Jewish flips. This opinion, which the accurate
researches of M. D'Anville rendered highly pro-
bable ", seems now to be eftablilhed with the
utmofl certainty by a late learned traveller;
who, by his knowledge of the monsoons in the
Arabian Gulf, and his attention to the ancient
mode of navigation, both in that sea and along
the African coast, has not only accounted for
the extraordinary length of time which the fleets
of Solomon took in going and returning, but
has fiewn, from circumstances mentioned con-

cerning

S E C T. concerning the voyage, that it was not made to

v any place in India°. The Jews, then, we may

conclude, have no title to be rcckoned among
the nations which carried on intercourse with
India by sea; and if, from deference to the fen-
timents of some respectable authors, their claim
vere to be admitted, we know with certainty,
that the commercial effort which they made in
the reign of Solomon was merely a transient one,
and that they quickly returned to their former
state of unsocial seclusion from the reft of man-
kind.

FROM collecting the scanty information which

history affords, concerning the most early at-
tempts to open a commercial intercourse with
India, I now proceed, with more certainty and
greater confidence, to trace the progress of com-
munication with that country, under the guid-
ance of authors who recorded events nearer to
their own times, and with refpet to which,
they had received more full and accurate intel-
ligence.

THE first establishment of any foreign power

in India, which can be ascertained by evidence,
meriting any degree of credit, is that of the
Persians; and even of this we have only a very

general

general and doubtful account. Darius, the Ton s E c T.
of Hyftafpes, though raised to the throne of *
Persia by chance or by artifice, possessed such
active and enterprizing talents, as rendered him
worthy of that high ltation. He examined the
different provinces of his kingdom more dili-
gently than any of his predecessors, and ex-
plored regions of Asia formerly little known .
Having subjec'ted to his dominion many of the
countries which firetched south-east from the
Caspian sea towards the river Oxus, his curio-
fity was excited to acquire a more extensive and
accurate knowledge of India, on which they
bordered. With this view he appointed Scylax
of Caryandra to take the command of a fqua-
dron fitted out at Cafpatyrus, in the country of
Padya, [the modern Pehkelv,] towards the
upper part of the navigable course of the river
Indus, and to fall down its fiream until he flould
reach the ocean. This Scylax performed, though
it should seem with much difficulty, and not-
withstanding many obstacles; for he Ipent no
less than two years and fix months in conducting
his squadron from the place where he embarked,
to the Arabian Gulfq. The account which he
gave of the populoufiefs, fertility, and high
cultivation of that region of India through
which his course lay, rendered Darius impatient
P lecrodot. lib. iv. c. 44. b1Lid. .42. 44.

S E C T. to become master of a country so valuable.

, This he soon accomplished; and though his

cohquefts in India fcem not to have extended
beyond the diftrif watered by the Indus, we
are led to form an high idea of its opulence, as
well a5 of the number of its inhabitants, in an-
cient times, when we learn, that the tribute
which he levied from it, was near a third part
of the whole revenue of the Persian monarchy'.
But neither this voyage of Scylax, nor the con-
queffs of Darius, to which it gave rife, diffused
any general knowledge of India. The Greeks,
who were the only enlightened race of men at
that time in Europe, paid but little attention to
the tranfic^ions of the people whom they confi-
dered as Barbarians, elfpecially in countries far
remote from their o'.vn; and Scylax had embel-
liflied the narrative of his voyage with so many
circurmfances, manif'flly fabulous', that he
teems to have met with the jufi punifliment to

rallies of paflion,, the indecent excesses of intern-
perance, and the ostentatious displays of vanity
too frequent in the conduct of this extraor-
dinary man, have so degraded his characer,
that the pre-eminence of his merit, either as a
conqueror, a politician, or a legislator, has fel-
dom been justly estimated. The subjet of my
present inquiry leads me to confider his opera-
tions only in one light, but it will enable me to
exhibit a (triking view of the grandeur and ex-
tent of his plans. He seems, soon after his sirs
successes in Asia, to have formed the idea of
establishing an universal monarchy, and aspired
to the dominion of the sea, as well as of the
land. From the wonderfil efforts of the Ty-
rians in their own defence, when left without
any ally or protector, he conceived an high opi-
nion of the resources of maritime power, and of
the wealth to be derived from commerce, cfpe-
cially that with India, which he found engrof3-d
by the citizens of Tyre. With a view to fccure
this commerce, and to eftaLiflh a ltation for it,
preferable in many refpec. to that of Tyre, as
soon as he completed the conquest of Egypt, lie
founded a city near one of the mouths of the
Nile, which he honoured with his own name;
and with ItUch admirable discernment was t'e

S E C T. world; and, notwithstanding many fuccefllve re-

,^ volutions in empire, continued, during eighteen

centuries, to be the chief feat of commerce with
India'. Amidst the military operations to which
Alexander was soon obliged to turn his atten-
tion, the desire of acquiring the lucrative com-
merce which the Tyrians had carried on with
India, was not relinquished. Events soon oc-
curred, that not only confirmed and added
firength to this desire, but opened to him a
prospect of obtaining the sovereignty of those
regions which supplied the reft of mankind with
so many precious commodities.

AFTER his final victory over the Persians, he

was led in pursuit of the last Darius, and of
Beffus, the murderer of that unfortunate mo-
narch, to traverse that part of Asia which
stretches from the Caspian sea beyond the river
Oxus. IHe advanced towards the east as far as
Maracanda", then a city of some note, and
dcfined, in a future period, under the modern
name of Samarcand, to be the capital of an em-
pire not inferior to his own either in extent or in
power. In a progress of fcvcral months, through
provinces hitherto unknown to the Greeks, in a
line of march often approaching near to India,

course with it, he learned many things concern- s E C T.
ing the state of a country that had been long
the object of his thoughts and wilhes', which
increased his desire of invading it. Decisive and
prompt in all his resolutions, he set out from
Batria, and croftcd that ridge of mountains
which, under various denominations, forms the
Stony Girdle (if I may use an expreflion of the
Oriental geographers) which encircles Asia, and
conffitutes the northern barrier of India,

THE most practicable avenue tb every coun-

try, it is obvious, muff be formed by circum-
stances in its natural situation, such as the defiles
which lead through mountains, the course of
rivers, and the places where they may be passed
with the greatest cafe arin safety. In no place
of the earth is this line of approach marked and
defined more confpicuouily, than on the north-
ern frontier of India; insomuch that the three
great invaders of this country, Alexander,
Tamerlane, and Nadir Shah, in three diitant
ages, and with views and talents extremely dif-
ferent, advanced by the fame route, with very
little deviation. Alexander Jlad the merit of
having first discovered the way. After passing

Porus, a powerful monarch of the country, at
the head of a numerous army. The war with
Porus, and the hostilities in which he was fuc-

him to deviate from his original route, and to
turn more towards the south-west. In carrying

know that this march was performed in the _
rainy season, when even Indian armies cannot
keep the field, it gives an high idea both of
Alexander's persevering spirit, and of the ex-
traordinary vigour and hardiness of constitution
which soldiers, in ancient times, derived from
the united effe&ts of gymnastic exercise and mi.
litary difciplinei In every ftep of his progress,
objets no less striking than new presented
themselves to Alexander. The magnitude of
the Indus, even after he had seen the Nile, the
Euphrates, and the Tigris, muff have filled him
with furprifeb. No country he had hitherto
vificed was so populous and well cultivated, or
abounded in so many valuable produtions of
nature and of art, as that part of India through
which he had led his army. But when he was
informed in every place, and probably with ex-
aggerated deliriptionj how much the Indus was
inferior to the Ganges, and how far all that he
had hitherto beheld was surpassed in the happy
regions through which that great river flows, it
is not wonderful that his eagerness to view and
to take pofleffion of them should have prompted
him to assemble his soldiers, and to propose that
they should resume their march towards that

S E T. quarter where wealth, dominion, and fame
*.c- - "awaited them. But they had already done so

much, and had suffered so greatly, especially
from incessant rains and extensive inundations,
that their patience as well as strength were ex-
haufted , and with one voice they refused to
advance farther. In this resolution they pcr-
'i'fted with such fullen obfiinacy, that Alexander,
though possessed in the highest degree of every
quality that gains an ascendant over the minds
of military men, was obliged to yield, and to
issue orders for marching back to Persia d.

THE scene of this memorable transaction was

on the banks of the Hyphafis, the modern
Beyah, which was the utmost limit of Alexander's
progress in India. From this it is manifest, that
he did not traverse the whole extent of the Pan-
jab. Its south-west boundary is formed by a
river anciently known by the name of Hyfu-
drus, and now by that of the Setlege, to which
Alexander never approached nearer than the
southern bank of the Hyphafis, where he ereted
twelve stupendous altars, which he intended as
a monument of his exploits, and which (if we
may believe the biographer ofApollonius Tya-
naus) were still remaining, with legible infcrip-

Alexander's expedition':. The breadth of the
Panjab, from Ludhana on the Setlege to Attock
on the Indus, is computed to be two hundred
and fifty-nine geographical miles, in a straight
line; and Alexander's march, computed in the
fame manner, did not extend above two hun-
dred miles. But, both as he advanced and
returned, his troops were so spread over the
country, and often a&ed in so many separate
divisions, and all his movements were so exactly
measured and delineated by men of science,
whom he kept in pay for the purpose, that he
acquired a very extensive and accurate know-

commercial schemes, the destination of this
fleet was to fail down the Indus to the ocean,

important trust. But as Alexander was ambitious
to acquire fame of every kind, and fond of en-
gaging in new and splendid undertakings, he
himself accompanied Nearchus in his navigation
down the river. The armament was, indeed,
so great and magnificent, as deserved to be
commanded by the conqueror of Asia. It was
composed of an army of a hundred and twenty
thousand men, and two hundred elephants, and
of a feet of near two thousand vessels, various
in burden and form Z; on board of which one-
third of the troops embarked, while the re-
mainder marching in two divificns, one on the
right, and the other on the left, of the river,
accompanied them in their progress. As they
advanced, the nations on each fide were either
compelled or persuaded to submit. Retarded
by the various operations in which this engaged
him, as well as by the flow navigation of such a
fleet as he condu&ed, Alexander was above nine
months before he reached the ocean h.

ALEXANDER'S

ALEXANDER'S progress in India, in this line S E C T.

of dire&ion, was far more considerable than G
that which he made by the route we formerly
tracedi and when we attend to the various
movements of his troops, the number of cities
which they took, and the different states which
they subdued, he may be said not only to have
viewed, but to have explored, the countries
through which he paired. This part of India
has been so little frequented by Europeans in
later times, that neither the position of places,
nor their distances, can be ascertained with the
fame accuracy as in the interior provinces, or
even in the Panjab. But from the rcfearches
of Major Rennell, carried on with no less dif-
cernment than industry, the distance of that
place on the Hydafpes, where Alexander fitted
out his fleet from the ocean, cannot be less than
a thousand British miles. Of this extensive
region a considerable portion, particularly the
upper Delta, itretching from the capital of the
ancient Malli, now Moultan, to Patala, the
modern Tatta, is diftinguiflled for its fertility
and population ',

SOON after he reached the ocean, Alexander,
satisfied with having accompliflhed this arduous

i Rclncll Mcm. 68, &c.

c 4 under-

S E C T. undertaking, led his army by land back to

, _,, Persia. The command of the fleet, with a con-

fiderable body of troops on board of it, he left
to Nearchus, who, after a coaffting voyage of
seven months, conduLted it safely up the Persian
Gulf into the Euphrates .

IN this manner did Alexander first open the

knowledge of India to the people of Europe,
and an extensive diftriEt of it was surveyed with
greater accuracy than could have been expected
from the lhort time he remained in that country.
Fortunately an exa& account, not only of his
military operations, but of every thing worthy
of notice in the countries where they were car-
ried on, was recorded in the Memoirs or Jour-
nals of three of his principal officers, Ptolemy
the son of Lagus, Ariftobulps, and Nea: hus,
The two former have not indeed reached our
times, but it is probable that the most important
fa&s which they contained are preserved, as
Arrian professes to have followed them as his
guides in his History of the Expedition of Alex-
ander'; a work which, though composed long
after Greece had loft its liberty, and in an age
when genius and taste were on the decline, is not
unworthy the purest times of Attic literature.

WITH refpe& to the general state of India, s E C T.

we learn from these writers, that in the age of A--
Alexander, though there was not established
in it any powerful empire, resembling that
which in modern times firetched its dominion
from the Indus almost to Cape Comorin, it
was even then formed into monarchies of
considerable extent. The king of the Prafij
was prepared on the banks of the Ganges to
oppose the Macedonians, with an army of twenty
thousand cavalry, two hundred thousand in-
fantry, two thousand armed chariots, and a
great number of elephants". The territory of
which Alexander constituted Porus the sovereign,
is fai;: to have contained seven diftin& nations,
and ;, ) fewer than two thousand towns . Even
in tme moll restric'ted sense that can be given
to the vague indefinite appellations of nations
ant, 3owns, an idea is conveyed of a very great
decrree of population. As the fleet failed down-
the river, the country on each fide was found
to be in no refpea inferior to that of which
the government was committed to Porus.

IT was likewise from the Memoirs of the
fame officers that Europe derived its first

the foil, the productions, and the inhabitants of
India; and in a country where the manners,
the customs, and even the dress of the peo.
pie are almost as permanent and invariable as
tile face of nature itself, it is wonderful how
exactly the descriptions given by Alexander's
officers delineate what we now behold in India,
at the distance of two thousand years. The
frated change of seasons, now known by the
name of 3Moifoans; the periodical rains; the
swelling of the rivers; the inundations which
these occasion; the appearance of the country
during their continuance; are particularly men.
tioned and described. No less accurate are
the accounts which they have given of the in-
habitants, their delicate and slender form, their
dark complexion, their black uncurled hair,
their garments of cotton, their living entirely
upon vegetable food, their division into separate
tribes or cats, the members of which never
intermarry, the custom of wives burning them-
selves with their deceased husbands, and many
other particulars, in all which they perfectly
refcmble the modern Hindoos. To enter into
any detail with refpe& to these in this place
would be premature; but as the fubje&, though
curious and interesting, will lead unavoidably
into difcuiTions not well suited to the nature of

Jin

an historical work, I lhall reserve my ideas s z c T.
concerning it for an Appendix, to be an- -
pexed to this Disquisition; and hope they
may contribute to throw some additional
light upon the origin and nature of the com-
nmerce with India,

MUCH as the Western world was indebted

for its knowledge of India to the expedition
of Alexander, it was only a small portion of
that vast continent which he explored. His opera-
tions did not extend beyond the modern province
of Lahore, and the countries on the banks of
the Indus from Moultan to the sea. These,
however, were surveyed with that degree of
accuracy which I have already described; and
it is a circumstance not unworthy of notice,
that this diftria of India which Europeans
first entered, and with which they were best
acquainted in ancient times, is now less known
than almost any part of that continent % neither
commerce nor war, to which, in every age,
geography is chiefly indebted for its improve-
ment, having led any nation of Europe to fre-
quent or explore it.

have

EC T. have reason to think, would have been more
*,- . fully explored by the ancients, and the Euro-

pean dominion would have been established
there two thousand years sooner. When Alex-
ander invaded India, he had something more
in view than a transient incursion. It was his
object to annex that extensive and opulent
country to his empire, and though the refracory
spirit of his army obliged him, at that time, to
suspend the prosecution of his plan, he was
far from relinquishing it. To exhibit a general
view of the measures which he adopted for
this purpose, and to point out their propriety
and probable success, is not foreign from the
fubjcct of this Disquisition, and will convey a
more just idea than is usually entertained, of
the original genius and extent of political wis-
dom which distinguished this illustrious man.

WHEN Alexander became master of the Per-

fian empire, he early perceived, that with all the
power of his hereditary dominions, re-inforced
by the troops which the ascendant he had ac-
quired over the various states of Greece might
enable him to raise there, he could not hope
to retain in fubjcction territories so extensive
and populous; that to render his authority
secure and permanent, it muff be eftabliflled
in the affetion cf the nations which he had

subdued,

subdued, and maintained by their arms; and s E c T.
that in order to acquire this advantage, all dif-
tindions between the victors and vanquished must
be abolished, and his European and Asiatic lub-
je&s must be incorporated, and become one peo-
ple, by obeying the fame laws, and by adopt-
ing the fame manners, institutions, and discipline.

LIBERAL as this pl;n of policy was, and well

adapted to accomplish what he had in view,
nothing could be more repugnant to the ideas
and prejudices of his countrymen. The Greeks
had such an high opinion of the pre-eminence
to which they were raised by civilization and
science, that they seem hardly to have acknow-
ldged the reft of mankind to be of the fame
species with themselves. To every other peo-
ple they gave the degrading appellation of Bar-
barians, and, in consequence of their own boaif-
ed superiority, they asserted a right of dominion
over them, in the fame manner (to use their own
expression) as the foul has over the body, and
men have over irrational animals. Extravsagan
as this pretension may now appear, it found
admifilon, to the ditfrace of ancient philosophy,
into all the schools. Aristotle, full of this
opinion, in flpport of which he employs argu-
ments more subtle than solid P, adviscd Alex-

a E c T. ander to govern the Greeks like fubjets, and

,-'- . the Barbarians as slaves; to confider the former

as companions, the latter as creatures of an in.
ferior nature . But the sentiments of the
pupil were more enlarged than those of his
master, and his experience in governing men
taught the monarch what the speculative fci-
ence of the philosopher did not discover.
Soon after the vicory at Arbela, Alexander
himself, and, by his persuasion, many of his
officers, assumed the Persian dress, and con-
formed to several of their customs. At the
fame time he encouraged the Perflari nobles
to imitate the manners of the Macedoniansj
to learn the Greek language, and to acquire
a relish for the beauties of the elegant writers
in that tongue, which were then universally
studied and admired. In order to render the
union more complete, he resolved to marry one
of the daughters of Darius, and chose wives
for a hundred of his principal officers in the
most illustrious Persian familiesi Their nup-
tials were celebrated with great pomp and
festivity, and with high exultation of the con-
quered people. In imitation of them, above
ten thousand Macedonians of inferior rank mar-
ried Persian women, to each of whom Alex-

4 ander

ander gave nuptial presents, as a testimony of s E c T.
his approbation of their conduc'. L.

BUT assiduously as Alexander laboured to

unite his European and Asiatic fubjecs by the
most indissoluble ties, he did not trust entirely
to the success of that measure for the security
of his new conquests. In every province
which he subdued, he made choice of proper
flations, where he built and fortified cities, in
which he placed garrisons, composed partly of
such of the natives as conformed to the Gre-
cian manners and discipline, and partly of such
of his European fubjefts, as were worn out
with the fatigues of service, and wished for
repose, and a permanent establishment. These
cities were numerous, and served not only as
a chain of posts to keep open the communica-
tion between the different provinces of his do-
minions, but as places of strength to over-awe
and curb the conquered people. Thirty thou-
sand of his new fubjeas, who had been dif-
ciplined in there cities, and armed after the
European fashion, appeared before Alexander
in Susa, and were formed by him into that com-

pict

S E C T. pac solid body of infantry, known by the name

,_-. . of the Phalanx, which constituted the strength

of a Macedonian army. But in order to fe-
cure entire authority over this new corps, as
well as to render it more effective, he ap-
pointed that every officer in it entrusted with
command, either superior or subaltern, should
be European. As the ingenuity of mankind
naturally has recourse in similar fiiations to
the fame expedients, the European powers, who
now in their Indian territories employ nume-
rous bodies of the natives in their service, have,
in forming the establishment of these troops,
adopted the fame maxims; and, probably with-
out knowing it, have modelled their battalions
of Seapoys upon the fame principles as Alex-
ander did his Phalanx of Persians.

THE farther Alexander pushed his conquests

from the banks of the Euphrates, which may
be confidered as the center of his dominions,
he found it necessary to build and to fortify a
greater number of cities. Several of there to
the East and South of the Caspian Tea are men-
tioned by ancient authors; and in India itself,
he founded two cities on the banks of the Hy-
dafpes, and a third on the Acefines, both na-
vigable rivers, which, after uniting their itreams,

fall

fall into the Indus . From the choice of s E c T.
such situations, it is obvious that he intended, -
by means of there cities, to keep open a com-
munication with India, not only by land, but
by sea. It was chiefly with a view to the latter
ofthefe objecs, (as I have already observed,) that
he examined the navigation of the Indus with so
much attention. With the fame view, on his re-
turn to Susa, he, in person, surveyed the course
of the Euphrates and Tigris, and gave dire&ions
to remove the cataraets or dams, with which the
ancient monarchs of Persia, induced by a pe-
culiar precept of their religion, which enjoined
them to guard with the utrnoft care against
defiling any of the elements, had conftrufted
near the mouths of these rivers, in order to
shut out their fubjets from any access to the
oceanr. By opening the navigation in this
manner, he proposed, that the valuable com-
modities of India should be conveyed from
thie Persian Gulf into the interior parts of
his Asiatic dominions, while by the Arabian
Gulf they fiould be carried to Alexandria, and
difiributed to the reft of the world.

/

S E C T. GRAND and extensive as these schemes were,

. the precautions employed, and the arrange-

ments made for carrying them into execution,
were so various and so proper, that Alexander
had good reason to entertain sanguine hopes
of their proving successful. At the time when
the mutinous spirit of his soldiers obliged him
to relinquish his operations in India, he was
not thirty years of age complete. At this en-
terprizing period of life, a prince, of a spirit
so a&ive, persevering, and indefatigable, muff
have soon found means to resume a fa-
vourite measure on which he had been long
intent. If he had invaded India a second
time, he would not, as formerly, have been
obliged to force his way through hostile and
unexplored regions, opposed at every flep by
nations and tribes of Barbarians, whose names
had never reached Greece. All Asia, from
the ihores of the Ionian sea to the banks of
the Hyphafis, would then have been subjec
to his dominion; and through that immense
stretch of country he had established such a
chain of cities, or fortified stations', that his
armies might have continued their march with
iafety, and have found a regular succession of
magazines provided for their subsistence. Nor

would

would it have been difficult for him to bring s E c T,
into the field forces sufficient to have atchieved -
the conquest of a country so populous and ex-
tensive as India. Having armed and difci-
plined his fubjets in the East like Europeans,
they would have been ambitious to imitate
and to equal their inftrutors, and Alexander
might have drawn recruits, not from his scanty
domains in Macedonia and Greece, but from
the vait regions of Asia, which, in every age,
has covered the earth, and astonished man-
kind with its numerous armies. When at the
head of such a formidable power he had reached
the confines of India, he might have entered
it under circumstances very different from
those in his firit expedition. He had secured
a firm footing there, partly by means of the
garrisons that he left in the three cities which
he had built and fortified, and partly by his
alliance with Taxiles and Porus. These two
Indian princes, won by Alexander's humanity
and beneficence, which, as they were virtues
seldom displayed in the ancient mode of car-
rying on war, excited of course an higher
degree of admiration and gratitude, had conti-
nued steady in their attachment to the Mace-
donians. Re-inforced by their troops, and
guidetd by their information as well as by the
experience which he had acquired in his

D 2 former

s E c T. former compaigns, Alexander must have made
I I-._, rapid progress in a country, where every in-

vader, from his time to the present age, has
proved successful.

BUT this and all his other splendid schemes

were terminated at once by his untimely death.
In consequence of that, however, events took
place, which iiluftrate and confirm the justness
of the preceding speculations and conjecures
by evidence the molt firiking and fatisfa&ory.
When that great empire, which the superior
genius of Alexander had kept united and in
lubjection, no longer felt his superintending
controul, it broke into pieces, and its various
provinces were seized by his principal officers,
and parcelled out among them. From am-
bition, emulation, and personal animosity, they
loon turned their arms against one another;
and as several of the leaders were equally
eminent for political abilities and for military
lkill, the contcft was maintained long, and
carnied on with frequent vicissitudes of fortune.
Amidll the. various convulsions and revolutions

lwhi-ch thele occasioned, it was found that the
measures cos Alexander for the preservation of
his conquers had been concerted with filch
sagacity, that, upon the final restoration of tran-
i-iilirt, the Macedonian dominion continued

to

to be cftablifhed in every part of Asia, and not s E C T.
one province had shaken off the yoke. Even -_
India, the molt remote of Alexander's con-
quests, quietly Submitted to Pytho the son of
Agenor, and afterwards to Seleucus, who fuc-
ceffively obtained dominion over that part of
Asia. Porus and Taxiles, notwithifanding the
death of their benefactor, neither declined sub-
miflion to the authority of the Macedonians, nor
made any attempt to recover independence.

DURING the contests for power and fuipe-

riority among the successors of Alexander,
Seleucus, who, in every effort of enterprising
ambition, was inferior to none of them, having
rendered himself mailer of all the provinces
of the Persian empire comprehended under
the name of Upper Asia, confidered those
countries of India, which had been sub-
dued by Alexander, as belonging to that por-
tion of the Macedonian empire of which he
was now the sovereign. Seleucus, like all the
officers formed under Alexander, entertained
such high ideas of the advantages which might
be derived from a commercial intercourse with
India, as induced him to march into that coun-
try, partly with a view of establishing his own
authority there, and partly in order to curb
Sandracottus, who having lately acquired the

D 3 sovereignty

S £C T. sovereignty of the Prafij, a powerful nation
I.---> on the banks of the Ganges, threatened to

attack the Macedonians, whose Indian territo-
ries bordered on his dominions. Unfortunately,
no account of this expedition, which teems
to have been splendid and fuccef&ful, has reached
our times. All we know of it is, that he ad-
vanced considerably beyond the utmost bound-
ary of Alexander's progress in India', and
would probably have proceeded much farther,
if he had not been constrained to flop short
in his career in order to oppose Antigonus,
who was preparing to invade his dominions at
the head of a formidable army. Before he
begun his march towards the Euphrates, he
concluded a treaty with Sandracottus; in con-
sequence of which, that monarch quietly re-
tained the kingdom he had acquired. But
the power and poffefRions of the Macedonians
fecm to have remained unimpaired during
the reign of Seleucus, which terminated forty-
two years after the death of Alexander.

WITH a view of cultivating a friendly inter-

course with Sandracottus, Seleucus made choice
of MegahJienes, an officer, who, from his hav-
ing accompanied Alexander in his expedition in-
to India; had some knowledge of the hlate of the

country, and the manners of its inhabitants, and s E C T.
fcnt him as his ambassador to Palibothra'. In f
this famous capital of the Prafij, situated on
the banks of the Ganges, Megafthenes resided
several years, and was probably the first Euro-
pean who ever beheld that mighty river, far
superior to any of the ancient continent in mag-
nitude , and no less diftinguilhed by the ser-
tility of the countries through which it flows.
This journey of Magafhenes to Palibothra made
Europeans acquainted with a large extent of coun-
try, of which they had not hitherto any know-
ledge; for Alexander did not advance farther
towards the south-east, than that part of the
river Hydraotes or Rauvee, where the modern
city of Lahore is situated, and Palibothra, the
site of which, as it is a capital position in the
geography of ancient India, I have investigated
with the utmost attention, appears to me the
fame with that of the modern city of Allahabad,
at the confluence of the two great rivers, Jum-
na and Ganges Y. As the road from Lahore to
Allahabad runs through some of the molt
cultivated and opulent provinces of India, the
more the country was explored the idea of
its value role higher. Accordingly, what Me-

L- impreflon upon his own mind, as induced him

to publish an ample account of India, in order
to make his countrymen more thoroughly ac-
quainted with its importance. From his writ-
ings the ancients seem to have derived almost
all their knowledge of the interior state of
India, and from comparing the three molt
ample accounts of it, by Diodorus Siculus,
Strabo, and Arrian, they appear manifefily,
from their near resemblance, to be a transcript
of his words. But, unfortunately, Megafthenes
was so fond of the marvellous, that he mingled
with the truths which he related many extra-
vagant fitions; and to him may be traced
up the fabulous tales of men with ears so large
that they could wrap themselves up in them,
of others with a single eye, without mouths,
without notes, with long feet, and toes turned
backwards, of people only three spans in height,
of wild men with heads in the shape of a wedge,
of ants as large as foxes that dug up gold, and
many other things no less wonderful . The

authors, or when they coincide with the expe- s E e T.
rience of modern times. His account, how- - ,
ever, of the dimensions and geography of India,
is curious and accurate. His description of
the power and opulence of the Prafij perfectly
resembles that which might have been given
of some of the greater states in the modern
Indoftan, before the establishment of the Ma-
homedan or European power in India, and is
consonant to the accounts which Alexander had
received concerning that people. He was in-
formed, as has been already mentioned, that they
were prepared to oppose him on the banks
of the Ganges, with an army confiting of
twenty thousand cavalry, two hundred thou-
sand infantry, and two thousand armed chariots';
and Megafthenes relates, that he had an audi-
ence of Sandracottus in a place where he was
encamped with an army of four hundred thou-
sand menb. The enormous dimensions which
he afligns to Palibothra, of no less than ten miles
in length, and two in breadth, and surrounded
by walls in which there were five hundred and fe-
venty towers, and fixty-four gates, would pro-
bably have been ranked by Europeans among
the wonders which he delighted to relate, if they

THIS embassy of Megafthenes to Sandra-

cottus, and another of Daimachus to his son
and successor Allitrochidas, are the lalt tranfac-
tions of the Syrian monarchs with India, of
which we have any account . Nor can we
either fix with accuracy the time, or describe
the manner in which their poffeflions in India
were wrested from them. It is probable that
they were obliged to abandon that country
soon after the death of Seleucus .

BUT though the great monarchs of Syria

loft, about this period, those provinces in India
which had been subject to their dominion,
the Greeks in a smaller kingdom, composed
of some fragments of Alexander's empire, still
maintained an intercourse with India, and even
made some considerable acquisition of territory
there. This was the kingdom of Bactria,
originally subjec to Seleucus, but wrested
from his son or grandson, and rendered an in-
dependent state, about fixty-nine years after

the death of Alexander. Concerning the s E C T.
tranfations of this kingdom, we must reft fa- *
tisfied with gleaning a few imperfect hints in
ancient authors. From them we learn that
its commerce with India was great; that the
conquests of the BaCrian kings in that country
were more extensive than those of Alexander
himself, and particularly that they recovered
possession of the district near the mouth of the
Indus, which he had subdued. Each of the
fix princes who reigned in Bacria, carried
on military operations in India with such fuc-
cess, that they penetrated far into the interior
part of the country, and proud of the conquests
which they had made, as well as of the extenlive
dominions over which they reigned, some of
them assumed the lofty title of Great King,
which distinguished the Persian monarchs in
the days of their highest splendour. But we
should not have known how long this king-
dom of Baftria subsisted, or in what manner
it terminated, if M. de Guignes had not called
in the historians of China to supply the defe&s
of the Greek ard Roman writers. By them
we are informed, that about one hundred and
twenty-fix years before the Christian axra, a

S E C T. powerful horde of Tartars, pushed from their na-

t.

tive feats on the confines of China, and obliged
to move towards the weft by the pressure of a
more numerous body that rolled on behind
them, paseld the Jaxartes, and pouring in upon
Badria, like an irresistible torrent, overwhelmed
that kingdom, and put an end to the dominion
of the Greeks' there, after it had been eftablilh-
ed near one hundred and thirty years .

FROM this time until the close of the fifteenth

century, when the Portuguese, by doubling the
Cape of Good Hope, opened a new communi-
cation with the East, and carried their vi&orious
arms into every part of India, no European
power acquired territory, or eftablilhed its do-
minion there. During this long period, of more
than sixteen hundred years, all schemes of con-
quest in India seem to have been totally relin-
quifhed, and nothing more was aimed at by any
nation, than to secure an intercourse of trade
with that opulent country.

IT was in Egypt that the feat of this intcr-

course was eflablifled; and it is not without
surprise that we observe howu soon and how re-

guilarly

gularly the commerce with the East came to s E C .
be carried on by that channel, in which the fa- -
gacity of Alexander destined it to flow. Ptolemy,
the son of Lagus, as soon as he took pofeflion
of Egypt, established the feat of government in
Alexandria. By some exertions of authority,
and many ats of liberality, but chiefly by the
fame of his mild and equal administration, he
drew such a number of inhabitants to this fa-
vourite residence, that it soon became a popu-
lous and wealthy city. As Ptolemy deserved
and had possessed the confidence of Alexander
more perfectly than any of his officers, he knew
well that his chief object in founding Alexandria
was to secure the advantages arising from the
trade with India. A long and prosperous reign
was favourable to the prosecution of that object,
and though ancient authors have not enabled us
to trace the fieps which the firit Ptolemy took
for this purpoie, we have a firiking evidence of
his extraordinary attention to naval affairs, in
his ere&ing a light-house on the island of Pharos,
at the mouth of the harbour of Alexandria h, a
work of such magnificence as to be reckoned
one of the fcven wonders of the world. With
reftFe to the commercial arrangements of his
f(n Ptolemy Philadlelphcs, we have more per-
fest information. In order to bring the trade

with

S E C T. with India, (which began to revive at Tyre, its
*-; . ancient station',) to centre in Alexandria, he

let about forming a canal, an hundred cubits in
breadth, and thirty cubits in depth, between
Arfinoe on the Red Sea, not far from the
situation of the modern Suez, and the Pelufiac
or eastern branch of the Nile, by means of
which the productions of India might have been
conveyed to that capital wholly by water. But
either on account of some danger apprehended
from completing it, that work was never finilh-
ed; or from the sow and dangerous navigation
towards the northern extremity of the Red Sea,
this canal was found to be of so little use, that
in order to facilitate the communication with
India, he built a city on the weft coast of that
sea, almost under the Tropic, to which he gave
the name of Berenicek. This new city soon
became the staple of the trade with India'.
From Berenice the goods were transported by
land to Coptos, a city three miles distant from
the Nile, but which had a communication with
that river by a navigable canal, of which there
are still some remains ", and thence carried down

the

the fircam to Alexandria. The distance between s E e T.
Berenice and Coptos was, according to Pliny, L,
two hundred and fifty-eight Roman miles, and
the road lay through the defart of Thebais,
almost entirely destitute of water. But the at-
tention of a powerful monarch made provision
for supplying this want, by searching for springs,
and wherever there were found he built inns, or
more probably in the eastern stile caravanferas,
for the accommodation of merchants". In this
channel the intercourse between the East and
Weft continued to be carried on during two
hundred and fifty years, as long as Egypt re-
mained an independent kingdom.

THE ihips destined for India took their depart-

ure from Berenice, and failing, according to
the ancient mode of navigation, along the Ara-
bian Ihore, to the promontory Syagrus, (now
Cape Rafalgate,) held their course along the
coast of Persia, either diretly to Pattala (now
Tatta) at the head of the lower Delta of the
Indus, or to some other emporium on the weft
coast of India. To this part of India, which
Alexander had visited and subdued, the com-
merce under the protection of the Egyptian
monarchs seems to have been confined for a

considerable

S E C T. considerable time. Afterwards a more conve-
i , 1 nient course was followed, and from Cape Rafal-

gate veifels failed in a direct course to Zizerus.
This, according to M. de Montesquieu °, was
the kingdom of Sigerris, on the sea coast ad-
jacent to the mouth of the Indus, conquered by
the Greek monarchs of Baclria; according to
Major Rennell P, it was a port on the northern
part of the Malabar coast. Ancient authors
have not conveyed such information as will
enable us to pronounce with certainty, which of
these two opposite opinions is best founded.
Nor can we point out with accuracy, what were
the other ports in India which the merchants
from Berenice frequented, when that trade
was first opened. As they failed in vessels of
small burden, which crept timidly along the
coast, it is probable that their voyages
were circumscribed within very narrow li-
mits, and that under the Ptolemies no con-
fiderable progress was made in the discovery of
India'.

FRo.i this monopoly of the commerce by

sea between the east and weft, which Egypt long
enjoyed, it derived that extraordinary degree of
opulence and power for which it was confpi-

cuous. In modern times, acquainted with the s z c T.
vigilant and enterprizing afivity of commercial
rivalflip, there is hardly any circumstance in
ancient story which appears more surprising,
than that the sovereigns of Egypt should have
been permitted to engross this lucrative trade
without competition, or any attempt to wrest it
out of their hands; especially as the powerful
monarchs of Syria might, from the Persian
Gulf, have carried on an intercourse with the
fame parts of India, by a ihorter and safer course
of navigation. Different considerations seem to
have induced them so tamely to relinquith all
the obvious advantages of this commerce, The
kings of Egypt, by their attention to maritime
affairs, had formed a powerful fleet, which gave
them such decided command of the sea, that
they could have crulhed with ease any rival in
trade. No commercial intercourse seems ever
to have been carried on by sea between Persia
and India. The Persians had such an infupe-
rable aversion to that element, or were so much
afraid of foreign invasion, that their monarchs
(as I have already observed) obftru&ed the na-
vigation of the great rivers, which gave access
to the interior parts of the country, by artificial
works. As their fubjeds, however, were no
less desirous than the people around them, to
poflefs the valuable produEtions and elegant

E manu-

s z c T. manufactures of India, these were conveyed to
b.-~- all the parts of their extensive dominions by

land-carriage. The commodities destined for
the supply of the northern provinces, were
transported on camels from the banks of
the Indus to those of the Oxus,' down the
stream of which they were carried to the
Caspian sea, and distributed, partly by land-
carriage, and partly by navigable rivers, through
the different countries, bounded on one hand by
the Caspian, and on the other by the Euxine,
tea'. The commodities of India intended for
the southern and interior provinces, proceeded
by land from the Caspian gates to some of the
great rivers, by which they were circulated
through every part of the country. This was
the ancient mode of intercourse with India,
while the Persian empire was governed by its
native princes; and it has been observed in
every age, that when any branch of commerce
has got into a certain channel, although it may
be neither the most proper nor the most
commodious one, it requires long time, and
considerable efforts, to give it a different di-
rection '.

To

To all these reasons for suffering the monarchs S E C T.

of Egypt to continue in the undiffurbed posses- -.-
sion of the trade with India by sea, another may
be added. Many of the ancients, by an error
in geography extremely unaccountable, and in
which they persisted, notwithstanding repeated
opportunities of obtaining more accurate in-
formation, believed the Carpian sea to be a
branch of the great Northern Ocean, and the
kings of Syria might hope by that means to
open a communication with Europe, and to
circulate through it the valuable producions of
the East, without intruding into those seas, the
navigation of which the Egyptian monarchs
seemed to confider as their exclusive right.
This idea had been early formed by the Greeks,
when they became masters of Asia. Seleucus
Nicator, the first and most sagacious of the Sy-
rian kings, at the time when he was assassinated,
entertained thoughts of forming a junction be-
tween the Caspian and Euxine seas by a canal',
and if this could have been effected, his sub-
jcts, besides the extension of their trade in
Europe, might have supplied all the countries
in the North of Asia, on the coast of the
Euxine sea, as well as many of those which
firetch eastward from the Caspian, with the
productions of India. As those countries,

E C T. though now thinly inhabited by a miserable
. -y .race of men, dclitute of industry and of wealth,

were in ancient times extremely populous, and
filled with great and opulent cities, this must
have been confidered as a branch of commerce
of such magnitude and value, as to render the
iecuring of it an object worthy the attention of
the most powerful monarch.

BUT v.hile the monarchs of TEgypt and Syria

laboured with emulation and ardour to secure
to their subjects all the advantages of the In-
dian tr-a., a pov-er arose in the Wefft which
proved fatal to both. The Romans, by the
vigour of their military institutions, and the
wisdom of their political conduc, having ren-
iered themfclves ma.ters of all Italy and Sicily,
soon overturned the rival republic of Carthage,
L c . filjectcd Macedonia and Greece, extended their

dominion over Syria, and at last turned their
victorious arms against Egypt, the only king-
domn remaining of those established by the fuc-
.elrors of Alexander the Great. After a series
Cf events, wh!ich belong not to the fubje& of
this iil::ii'.;eun, !'lgypt was annexed to the
Rorrma cnpile, and reduced into the form of a

citude stems to have proceeded not only from
confidering Egypt as one of the chief granaries
on which the capital depended for subsistence,
but as the feat of that lucrative commerce which
had enabled its ancient monarchs to amass such
enormous wealth, as excited the admiration and
envy of other princes, and produced, when
brought into the treasury of the empire, a confi-
deraLle alteration, both in the value of property,
and the (tate of manners, in Rome itfclf.

Intercourse with India, frcm the Esiblihment

of the Roman Dominion in Egypt, to the Con-
quest of that Kingdom by the Mahomedans.
s E c T. UPON the conquest of Egypt by the Romans,

* -J _ and the reduftion of that kingdom to a

province of their empire, the trade with India
continued to be carried on in the fame mode,
under their powerful proteftion: Rome, en-
riched with the spoils and the tribute of
almost all the known world, had acquired a
taste for luxuries of every kind. Among
people of this description, the productions of
India have always been held in the highell
estimation. The capital of the grcateft em-

pire

pire ever established in Europe, filled with s E C T.
citizens who had now no occupation, but to .-
enjoy and dissipate the wealth accumulated
by their ancestors, demanded every thing
elegant, rare, or costly, which that remote
region could furnish, in order to support
its pomp, or heighten its pleasures. To
supply this demand, new and extraordinary es-
forts became requisite, and the commerce with
India increased to a degree, which (as I have
observed in another place 1) will appear astonish-
ing even to the present age, in which that
branch of trade has been extended far beyond
the prastice or conception of any former
period.

BESIDES the Indian commodities imported

into the capital of the empire from Egypt,
the Romans received an additional supply of
them by another mode of conveyance. From
the earliest times, there seems to have been
some communication between Mesopotamia,
and other provinces on the banks of the Eu-
phrates, and those parts of Syria and Palestine,
which lay near the Mediterranean. The mi-
gration of Abram from Ur, of the Chaldees
to Sichem in the land of Canaan, is an instance
of thisb. The journey through the defart,

with water, and capable of cultivation. As
the intercourse increa.-d, the poffcion of
this rfation became an obje& of so much
importance, that Solomon, when he turned
his attention towards the extension of commerce
among his fubjets, built a fenced city there .
Its Syrian name of Tadmor in the wilderness,
and its Greek one of Palmyra, are both descriptive
of its situation in a spot adorned with palm-trees.
This is not only plentifully supplied with water,
but surrounded by a portion of fertile land,
which (though of no great extent) renders it
a delightful habitation in the midst of barren
sands and an inhospitable defart. Its happy
position, at the distance of eighty-five miles
from the river Euphrates, and about one hun-
dred and seventeen miles from the nearest
coast of the Mediterraneand, induced its
inhabitants to enter with ardour into the trade
of conveying commodities from one of these

these errors I was led by M. D'Anville, who, in his

in old age, did not retain his wonted accuracy. From

to the other. As the most valuable productions s E c T.
of India, brought up the Euphrates from the Per- , -
fian Gulf, are of such small bulk as to bear
the expence of a long land-carriage, this trade
soon became so considerable that the opulence
and power of Palmyra increased rapidly. Its go-
vernment was of the form which is best suited
to the genius of a commercial city, republican;
and from the peculiar advantages of its situation,
as well as the spirit of its inhabitants, it long
maintained its independence, though surrounded
by powerful and ambitious neighbours. Under
the Syrian monarchs descended from Seleucus
it attained to its highest degree of splendour
and wealth, one great source of which seems to
have been the supplying their subjects with
Indian commodities. When Syria submitted
to the irresistible arms of Rome, Palmyra con-
tinued upwards of two centuries a free state,
and its friendship was courted with emulation
and solicitude by the Romans, and their rivals
for empire, the Parthians. That it traded with
both, and particularly that from it Rome as
well as other parts of the empire received the
productions of India, we learn from Appian,
an author of good credit'. But in tracing theY
progress of the commerce of the ancients with

---t single testimony, to mention this among the

channels of note in which it was carried on,
if a singular discovery, for which we are in-
debted to the liberal curiosity and enterprizing
spirit of our'own countrymen, did not confirm
and illuitrate what he relates. Towards the
close of the last century, rome gentlemen of
the English factory at Aleppo, incited by what
they heard in the East concerning the won-
derful ruins of Palmyra, ventured, notwith-
lfanding the fatigue and danger of a journey
through the defart, to visit them. To their
astonishment they beheld a fertile spot of tome
miles in extent, arising like an island out
of a vail plain of.fand, covered with the re-
mains of temples, porticoes, aqueducts, and
other public works, which, in magnificence
and splendour, and some of them in elegance,
were not unworthy of Athens or of Rome in
their most prosperous state. Allured by their
description of them, about sixty years thereafter,
a party of more enlightened travellers, having
reviewed the ruins of Palmyra with greater atten-
tion and more scientific skill, declared that what
they beheld there exceeded the most exalted
ideas which they had formed concerning it'.

13 FROM

FROM both these accounts, as well as from s E c T.

recolleting the extraordinary degree of power ._,
to which Palmyra had attained, when Egypt,
Syria, Mesopotamia,, and a considerable part
of Asia Minor were conquered by its arms;
when Odenatus, its chief magistrate, was de-
corated with the Imperial purple, and Zenobia
contended for the dominion of the East with
Rome under one of its most warlike Emperors,
it is evident, that a ftatc which could derive
little importance from its original territory,
must have owed its aggrandizement to the
opulence acquired by extensive commerce. Of
this the Indian trade was undoubtedly the rnoft
considerable, and most lucrative branch. ]ut
it is a cruel mortification, in searching for what
is inftrutive in the history of past times, to
find that the exploits of conquerors who have
desolated the earth, and the freaks of tyrants
who have rendered nations unhappy, are re-
corded with minute and often disgusting ac-
curacy, while the discovery of useful arts, and
the progress of the most beneficial branches of
commerce, are passed over in silence, and sus-
sered to fink into oblivion.

AFTER the conquest of Palmyra by Aurelian,

trade never revived there. At present a few
miserable huts of beggarly Arabs are scattered
in the courts of its stately temples, or deform its

elegant

s E C T. elegant porticoes; and exhibit an humiliating
' - * contrast to its ancient magnificence.

BUT while the merchants of Egypt and Syria

exerted their aEtivity in order to supply the
increasing demands of Rome for Indian com-
modities, and vied with each other in their
efforts, the eagerness of gain (as Pliny observes)
brought India itself nearer to the reft of the
world. In the course of their voyages to that
country, the Greek and Egyptian pilots could
not fail to observe the regular ihifting of the
periodical winds or monsoons, and how steadily
they continued to blow during one part of
the year from the East, and during the other
from the Weft. Encouraged by attending
to this circumstance, Hippalus, the commander
of a ship engaged in the Indian trade, ventured,
about fourscore years after Egypt was annexed
to the Roman empire, to relinquish the flow
and circuitous course which I have described,
and itretching boldly from the mouth of the
Arabian Gulf across the ocean, was carried by
the western monsoon to Mufiris, a harbour
in that part of India, now known by the name
of the Malabar coast.

THIS route to India was held to be a dif-

covery of such importance, that in order to
perpetuate the memory of the inventor, the

name

name of Hippalus was given to the wind s E c T.
which enabled him to perform the voyage'. -
As this was one of the greatest efforts of na-
vigation in the ancient world, and opened the
belt communication by sea between the East
and Weft that was known for fourteen hundred
years, it merits a particular description. For-
tunately Pliny has enabled us to give it with
a degree of accuracy, which can seldom be
attained in tracing the naval or commercial
operations of the ancients. From Alexandria
(he observes) to Juliopolis is two miles; there
the cargo destined for India is embarked on
the Nile, and is carried to Coptos, which is
distant three hundred and three miles, and
the voyage is usually accomplished in twelve
days. From Coptos goods are conveyed by
land carriage to Berenice on the Arabian Gulf,
halting at different fations regulated according
to the conveniency of watering. The distance
between these cities is two hundred and
fifty-eight miles. On account of the heat,
the caravan travels only during the night, and
the journey is finished on the twelfth day.
From Berenice, ships take their departure
about midsummer, and in thirty days reach

S E C T. Gulf, or Cane, (Cape Fartaque,) on the coast

_ of Arabia Felix. Thence they fail in forty

days to Mufiris, the first emporium in India.
They begin their voyage homewards early in
the Egyptian month Thibi, which answers to
our December; they fail with a north-east

meet with a south or fcuth-weft wind, and
thus complete the voyage in less than a year h.

THE account which Pliny g;:ves of Mufiris,

and of Barace, another harbour not far distant,
which was likewise frequented by the ihips
from Berenice, as being both so incommodious for
trade on account of the shallowness of the ports,
that it became necessary to dicharge and take
in the cargoes in {inall boats, does not enable
us to fix their position with perfect accuracy.
This description applies to many ports on the
Malabar coast, but from two circulmfances
mentioned by him; one, that they are not far
distant from Cottonara, the country which pro-
duces pepper in great abundance; and the
other, that in fiiling towards them the course
lay near Nitrias, the ifation of the pirates; I
adopt the opinion of Major Rennell, that they
were fituaecd somewhere between Goa and

Telli-

Tellicherry, and that probably the modern s E c T.
Meerzaw or Merjee is the Mufiris of the a
ancients, and Barcelore their Barace .

As in there two ports was the principal staple

of the trade between Egypt and India, when
in its most flourishing Rfate, this seems to be
the proper place for inquiring into the nature
of the commerce which the ancients, particu-
larly the Romans, carried on with that coun-
try, and for enumerating the commodities most
in request, which they imported from it. But
as the operations of commerce, and the mode
of regulating it, were little attended to in those
states of antiquity, of whose tranfaftions we
have any accurate knowledge; their historians
hardly enter into any detail concerning a subjet
of such Subordinate importance in their political
system, and it is mostly from brief hints, de-
tached fats, and incidental observations, that
we can gather information concerning itk.

IN every age, it has been a commerce of

luxury, rather than of necefflty, which has
been carried on between Europe and India.
Its elegant manufactures, spices, and precious
stones, are neither objects of desire to nations

of

e CT. of simple manners, nor are such nations poffefr-
. v -. ed of wealth sufficient to purchase them; But

at the time the Romans became maffers of the
Indian trade, they were not only (as has already
been observed) in that stage of society when
men are eager to obtain every thing that can
render the enjoyment of life more exquisite,
or add to its splendour, but they had acquired
all the fantastic taftes formed by the caprice
and extravagance of wealth. They were of
consequence highly delighted with those new ob-
jecs of gratification with which India supplied
them in such abundance. The productions of
that country, natural as well as artificial, seem
to have been much the fame in that age as
in the present. But the taste of the Romans
in luxury differed in many refpeds from that
of modern times, and of course their demands
from India differed considerably from ours.

In order to convey an idea of their demands

as complete as possible, I flmall in the first place
make some observations on the three great
articles of general importation from India.
!. Spices and aromatics. 2. Precious stones
and pearls. 3. Silk. And then I shall give
fomc account (as far as I can venture to do
it from authentic information) of the assortment
of cargoes, both outward and homeward bound,

for

for the vessels fitted out at Berenice to different s E c T.
ports of India.

I. SPICES and aromatics. From the mode of

religious worihip i- the heathen world; from
the incredible number of their deities, and of
the temples consecrated to them; the con-
fumption of frankincense and other aromatics
which were used in every sacred fun-cion, muff
have been very great. But the vanity of men
occasioned a greater consumption of these
fragrant substances, than their piety. It was
the custom of the Romans to burn the bodies
of their dead, and they deemed it a display of
magnificence, to cover, not only the body but
the funeral pile on which it was laid, with the
most costly spices. At the funeral of Sylla,
two hundred and ten burthens of spices were
itrewed upon the pile. Nero is reported to
have burnt a quantity of cinnamon rnd cafia.
at the funeral of Pappeca, greater than the
countries from which it was imported produced
in one year. Wve consume in heaps these pre-
cious substances with the carcafTs of the dead
(fays Pliny): We offer them to the Gods on'l/
in grains". It was not fo:m India, I am aware,
but from Arabia, that aromatics were t.fir im-
ported into Europe; and ibme of themn, par-
ticular'ly frankincense, were productions of thiat

m Nat. Hist. lib.:ii. c. 18.

F country.

S E C T country. But the Arabians were accustomed,
A',-· together with spices of native growth, to fur-

nifh foreign merchants with others of higher
value, which they brought from India, and
the regions beyond it. The commercial inter-
course of the Arabians with the Eastern parts
of Asia, was not only early, but considerable.
By means of their trading caravans, they con-
veyed into their own country all the valuable
productions of the East, among which, spices
held a chief place. In every ancient account
of Indian commodities, spices and aroma-
tics of various kinds form a principal ar-
ticle . Some authors assert that the greater
part of those purchased in Arabia were not
the growth of that country, but brought from
India'. That this assertion was well-founded,
appears from what has been observed in mo-
dern times. The frankincense of Arabia,
though reckoned the peculiar and most pre-
cious production of the country, is much in-
ferior in quality to that imported into it from
the East; and it is chiefly with the latter, that
the Arabians at present supply the extensive
demTands of various provinces of Asia for this
conimmoldi P. It is upon good authority, then,

that

that I have mentioned the importation of spices S E c T.
as one of the most considerable branches of l
ancient commerce with India. In the Auguf-
tan age, an entire street in Rome seems to have
been occupied by those who fold frankincense,
pepper, and other aromatics q.

II. PREcIOUS itones, together with which

pearls may be classed, seem to be the article
next in value imported by the Romans from
the East. As there have no pretension to be
of any real use, their value arises entirely from
their beauty and their rarity, and even when
estimated most moderately is slways high.
But among nations far advanced in luxury,
when they are deemed not only ornaments but
marks of diftintion, the vain anil the opulent
vie so eagerly with one another for the pof-
session of them, that they rife in price to an
exorbitant and almost incredible height. Dia-
monds, though the art of cutting them was
imperfectly known to the ancients, held an high
place in estimation among them as well as
among us. The comparative value of other
precious stones varied according to the diver-
fity of taftes and the caprice of fashion. The
iinmenfe number of them mentioned by Plin-,

cious stones, it is true, as well as pearls, were
found noc only in India, but in many different
countries, and all were ransacked in order to

fratitf the pride of Rome. India, however,

were allowed to be most abundant, diversified, _,
and valuable.

III. ANOTHER producJion of India in great

demand at Rome, was silk; and when we re-
collect the variety of elegant fabrics into which
it may be formed, and how much these have
added to the splendour of dress and furniture, we
cannot wonder at its being held in such eftima-
tion by a luxurious people. The price it bore
was exorbitant; but it was deemed a dress too cx-
pensive and too delicate for men , and was ap-
propriated wholly to women of eminent rank and
opulence. This, however, did not render the
demand for it less eager, especially after the
example of the difolute Elagabalus introduced
the use of it among the other sex, and accuf-
tomed men to the disgrace (as the severity of
ancient ideas accounted it) of wearing this es-
feminate garb. Two circumstances concerning
the traffic of silk among the Romans merit ob-
servation. Contrary to what usually takes place
in the operations of trade, the more general
uife of that commodity seems not to have in-
creased the quantity imported, in such propor-
tion as to answer the growing demand for it,

Tacit. Annal. lib. ii. c. 33.

F 3 and

Er c T. and the price of silk was not reduced during
,_!_ dthe course of two hundred and fifty years from

the time of i:s being firrt known in Rome.
In the reign of Aurelian, it still continued to be
valued at its weight in gold. This, it is pro-
bable, was owing to the mode in which that
commodity was procured by the merchants of
Alexandria. They had no dire&t intcrcourfe
with China, the only country in which the silk-
worm was then reared, and its labour rendered
an article of commerce. All the silk which
they purchased in the different ports of India
that they frequented, was brought thither
in fliips of the country; and either from some
dcefet of skill in managing the silk-worm,
the produce of its ingenious indultry among
the Chinese was scanty, or the intermediate
cdealers found greater advantage in furnilhing
the market of Alexandria with a small quantity
at an high price, than to lower its value by
increasing the quantity. The other circum-
11ance which I had in viz'w, is more extraor-
c.inarv, and aflr.id a irining proof of the im-

several centuries after the use of it became corn- s C T.
mon, any certain knowledge either of the *
countries to which they were indebted for
this favourite article of elegance, or of the man-
ner in which it was produced. By some, silk
was supposed to be a fine down adhering to
the leaves of certain trees or flowers; others
imagined it to be a delicate species of wool or cot-
ton; and even those who had learned that it was
the work of an inset, shew, by their descriptions,
that they had no diftin&t idea of the manner
in which it was formed'. It was in confe-
quence of an event that happened in the sixth
century of the Christian era, of which I shall
hereafter take notice, that the real nature of silk
became known in Europe.

THE other commodities usually imported from

India, will be mentioned in the account, which
I now proceed to give, of the cargoes sent out
and brought home in the ships employed in the
trade with that country. For this we are in-
debted to the Circumnavigation of the Ery-
thraan Sea, ascribed to Arrian, a curious though
flort treatise, less known than it deserves to
be, and which enters into some details con-
cerning commerce, to which there is nothing

X Sec NOTE XXIV.

S E C T. similar in any ancient writer. The first place

_ in India, in which the ships from Egypt, while

they followed the ancient course of navigation,
were accustomed to trade, was Patala in the
river Indus. They imported into it woollen
cloth of a flight fabric, linen in chequer work,
some precious stones, and some aromatics un-
known in India, coral, storax, glass vessels of
different kinds, some wrought silver, money,
and wine. In return for these, they received
spices of various kinds, sapphires, and other
gems, silk stuffs, silk thread, cotton clothsr,
and black pepper. But a far more considerable
emporium on the fame coast was Barygaza,
and on that account the author, whom I follow
here, dcfcribes its Situation, and the mode of
approaching it, with great minuteness and ac-
curacy. Its situation corresponds entirely with
that of Baroach, on the great river Ncrbuddah,
down the fiream of which, or by land-carriage,
from the great city of Tagara across high-moun-
tains z, all the productions of the interior coun-
try w-re conveyed to it. The articles of im-
portazion and exportation in this great mart
were extensive and various. Betides there al-
ready mentioned, our author enumerates among
the former, Italian, Greek, and Arabian wines,

melot, white glass, red arsenic, black, _

lead, gold and silver coin. Among the exports
he mentions the onyx, and other gems, ivory,
myrrh, various fabrics of cotton, both plain
and ornamented with flowers, and long pepper '.
At Mufiris, the next emporium of note on that
coast, the articles imported were much the fame
as at Barygaza; but as it lay nearer to the eaf-
tern parts of India, and seems to have had
much communication with them, the commo-
dities exported from it were more numerous and
more valuable. He specifies particularly pearls
in great abundance and of extraordinary beauty,
a variety of silk stuffs, rich perfumes, tortoise-
shell, different kinds of transparent gems, efpe-
cially diamonds, and pepper in large quantities,
and of the best quality b

THE justness of the account given by this

author of the articles imported from India, is
'cnfirmed by a Roman law, in which the
Indian commodities fubjeEt to the payment of
duties are enumerated'. By comparing these
two accounts, we may form an idea tolerably

cx.ict,

s E C T. exaE, of the nature and extent of the trade with

" India in ancient times.

As the state of society and manners among

the natives of India, in the earliest period in
which they are known, nearly resembled what
we observe among their defcerdants in the pre-
fcnt age; their wants and demands were, of
course, much the fame. The ingenuity of their
own artists were so able to supply these, that
they flood little in need of foreign manufatures
or produtions, except some of the useful metals,
which their own country did not furnish in sus-
ficient quantity; and then, as now, it was mostly
with gold and silver that the luxuries of the
East were purchascd. In two particulars, how-
ever, our importations from India differ greatly
from those of the ancients. The dress, both
of the Greeks and Romans, was almost entirely
woollen, which, by their frequent use of the
warm bath, was rendered abundantly com-
sortable. Their consumption of linen and cot-
ton cloths was much inferior to that of modern
times, when these are worn by persons in every
rank of life. Accordingly, a great branch of
modern importation from that part of India
with which the ancients were acquainted, is in
p:;:e-gccds; comprehending, under that mer-.
cantile term, the immcnfi variety of fabrics,

which

which Indian ingenuity has formed of cotton. S E C T;
But, as far as I have observed, we have no au- A _
thority that will justify us in stating the ancient
importation of these to be in any degree con-
fiderable.

Ix modern times, though it continues still

to be chiefly a commerce of luxury that is car-
ried on with India, yet, together with the ar-
ticles that minister to it, we import, to a con-
fiderable extent, various commodities, which
are to be confidered merely as the materials of
our domestic manufactures. Such are, the cot-
ton-wool of Indoftan, the silk of China, and
the salt-petre of Bengal. But, in the accounts
of ancient importations from India, raw silk and
filk-thread excepted, I find nothing mentioned
that could serve as the materials of any home-
manufacture. The navigation of the ancients
never having extended to China, the quantity
of unwrought silk with which they were sup-
plied, by means of the Indian traders, appears
to have been so scanty, that the manufacture
of it could not make an addition of any moment
to their doreftic industry.

AFTER this fuccint account of the commerce

carried on by the ancients in India, I proceed
to inquire what knowledge they had of the
co intrics beyond the ports of Mufiris and Barace,

the

s E c T. the utmost boundary towards the East to which

_ I have hitherto traced their progress. The

Author of the Circumnavigation of the Ery-
thran Sea, whose accuracy of description jus-
ifies the confidence with which I have followed
him for some time, seems to have been little
acquainted with that part of the coast which
stretches from Barace towards the south. He
mentions, indeed, cursorily, two or three dif-
ferent ports, but gives no intimation that any of
them were flaples ofthe commerce with Egypt.
He hastens to Comar or Cape Comorin, the
southernmost point of the Indian peninsula; and
his description of it is so accurate, and io
conformable to its real state, as shews his in-
tormation concerning it to have been perfeEtly
authentic A. Near to this he places the pearl-
fishery of Colchos, the modern Kilkare, un-
doubtedly the fame with that now carried on
by the Dutch in the ftreight which separates
the island of Ceylon from the continent; as
adjacent to this he mentions three different
ports, which appear to have been situated on
the east fide of the peninsula now known by
the name of the' Coromandel coast. Ile de-
scribes these as emporia, or itarions of trade;
but from an attentive confideraticn of some cir-

cu:fmances

cumflances in his account of them, I think it s E C T.
probable that the ships from Berenice did not _
fail to any of these ports, though they were
supplied, as he informs us, with the commodities
brought from Egypt, as well as with the pro-
ductions of the opposite coast of the peninsula;
but these seem to have been imported in country
/hips f. It was likewise in vessels of their own,
varying in form and burden, and distinguished
by different names, tome of which he mentions,
that they traded with the Golden Cherfonefus,
or kingdom of Malacca, and the countries near
the Ganges. Not far from the mouth of tint
river he places an island, which he describes as
situated under the rising fun, and as the last
region in the East that was inhabited . Of all
these parts of India, the Avthor of the Circum-
navigation appears to have had very slender
knowledge, as is manifest, not only from what
he mentions concerning this imaginary island,
and from his not attempting to describe them,
but from his relating, with the credulity and
love of the marvellous, which always accom-
pany and charaCceriie ignorance, that there re-
mote regions were peopled with cannibals, and
men of uncu.ith and monstrous forms h.

I HAVE-

S E C T. I HAVE been induced to bestow this attention,

- in tracing the course delineated in the Circum-

navigation of the Erythrxan Sea, because the
Author of it is the first ancient writer to whom
we are indebted for any knowledge of the eaf-
tern coast of the great peninsula of India, or
of the countries which lie beyond it. To Strabo,
who composed his great work on geography
in the reign of Augustus, India, particularly the
most eastern parts of it, was lFttle known. He
begins his description of it with requesting the
indulgence of his readers, on account of the
scanty information he could obtain with refpet:
to a country so remote, which Europeans had
seldom visited, and many of them transiently
only, in the functions of military service. He
observes, that even commerce had contributed
little towards an accurate investigation of the
country, as few of the merchants from Egypt
and the Arabian Gulf had ever failed as far
as the Ganges; and from men so illiterate,
intelligence that merited a full degree of con-
fidence could scarcely be expected. His de-
scriptions of India, particularly its interior pro-
vinces, are borrowed almost entirely from the
Memoirs of Alexander's Officers, with some
slender additions from more recent accounts,
and there so few in number, and Sometimes so
inaccurate, as to furnifl a itriking proof of the

small

small progress which the ancients had made, s E C T.
from the time of Alexander, in exploring that --
country. When an author, possessed of such
discernment and industry as Strabo, who visited
in person several distant regions, that he might
be able to describe them with greater accuracy,
relates, that the Ganges enters the ocean by one
mouth', we are warranted in concluding,
that in his time there was either no direct na-
vigation carried on to that great river, by the
traders from the Arabian Gulf, or that this
voyage was undertaken so seldom, that fci-
ence had not then derived much information
from it.

THE next author, in order of time, from

whom we receive any account of India, is the
elder Pliny, who flourished about fifty years
later than Strabo. As in the short description
of India, given in his Natural History, he follows
the fame guides with Strabo, and seems to have
had no knowledge of the interior country, but
what he derived from the Memoirs of the Of-
ficers who served under Alexander and his im-
mediate successors, it is unnecessary to examine
his description minutely. He has added, how-
ever, two valuable articles, for which he was
indebted to more recent discoveries. The one

S E C T. is the account of the new course of navigation
* , _ · from the Arabian Gulf to the coast of Malabar,

the nature and importance of which I have
already explained. The other is a description
of the island of Taprobanaj which I hall con-
fider particularly, after enquiring into what
Ptolemy has contributed towards our knowledge
of the ancient fate of the Indian continent.

THOuLGH Ptolemy, who published his works

about fourscore years after Pliny, seems to have
been diftinguified for his persevering industry,
and talent for arrangement, rather than for an in-
ventive genius; geography has been more in-
debted to him for its improvement, than to any
other phiiofopher. Fortunately for that science,
in forming his general system of geography, he
adopted the ideas, and imitated the pratice of
Hipparchus, who lived near four hundred years
before his time. That great philosopher was
the first who attempted to make a catalogue of
the stars. In order to ascertain their position
in the heavens with accuracy, he measured their
distance from certain circles of the sphere, com-
puting it by degrees, either from east to weft,
or from north to south. The former was de-
nominated the longitude of the flar, the latter
its latitude. This mode he found to be of such
-urility in his astronomical researches,. that he
applied it with no less happy effe& to geogra-

X IIy phy;

phy; and it is a circumstance worthy of notice, s E C T.
that it was by observing and describing the * -
heavens, men were firit taught to measure and
delineate the earth with exalcnefs. This me-
thod of fixing the position of places, invented
by Hipparchus, though known to the geogra-
phers between his time and that of Ptolemy,
*and mentioned both by Strabo and by Pliny ',
was not employed by any of them. Of this
neglect the most probable account seems to
be, that, as none of them were aftrdnomers,
they did not fully comprehend all the advan-
tages geography might derive from this inven-
tion . These Ptolemy, who had devoted a
long life to the improvement of astronomy,
theoretical as well as practical, perfecly dif-
cerned, and, as in both Hipparchus was his
guide, he, in his famous treatise on geogra-
phy, described the different parts of the earth
according to their longitude and latitude. Geo-
graphy was thus establiihed upon its proper-prin-
ciples, and intimately conneced with aftronomi-
cal observation and mathematical science. This
work of Ptolemy soon role high in estimation
among the ancients . During the middle ages,
both in Arabia and in Europe, the decisions of

*09 ~ Ptolemy,

s r T Ptolemy, in every thing relative to geography,
L*;- were submitted to with an assent as implicit,

as was yielded to those of Aritotle in all other
departments of science. On the revival of a
more liberal ipirit of inquiry in the fxteenth
century, the merit of Ptolemy's improvements
in gcography was examined and recognized;
that fciendfic language which he firif rendered
general, continues to be used, and the position
of places is still ascertained in the fame diftint
and compendious manner, by specifying their
longitude and latitude.

NOT satisfied with adopting the general prin-

ciples of Hipparchus, Ptolemy emulated him
in the application of them; and, as that philo-
fopher had arranged all the constellations, he
ventured upon what was no less arduous, to
survey all the regions of the earth which were
then known, and with minute and bold de-
cifion he fixed the longitude and latitude of the
mica remarkable places in each of them. All
iis determinations, however, are not to be con-
fidercd as the result of atual observation, nor
did Ptolemy publish them as such. Aftrono-
nical fcicnce was confined, at that time, to
a f-iw countries. A considerable part of the
globe wes little '.siltcd, and imperfetly dc-
jcr..:(i. '' : :o!i.ien of a fimall number of

places only had been fixed with any degree of s E c T.
accuracy. Ptolemy was therefore obliged to
consult the itineraries and surveys of the Roman
Empire, which the political wisdom of that
great state had completed with immense labour
and expence". Beyond the precinrts of the
empire, he had nothing on which he could rely,
But the journals and reports of travellers. Upon
these all his conclusions were founded; and as
he resided in Alexandria at a time when the
trade from that city to India was carried on to
its utmost extent, this situation might have
been expe&ed to afford him the means of pro-
curing ample information concerning it. But
either from the imperfect manner in which that
country was explored in his time, or from his
placing too much confidence in the reports of
persons who had visited it with little attention
or discernment P, his general delineation of the
form of the Indian continent is the most er-
roneous that has been transmitted to us from
antiquity. By an astonishing mistake, he has
made the peninsula of India stretch from the
Sinus Barygazenus, or Gulf of Cambay, from
weft to east, instead of extending, according
to its real diretion, from north to south .

c, This

s E C T. This error wvill appear the more unaccountable

when we rccollec that Megafthcnes had pub-
liihed a measurement of the Indian peninsula,
which approaches near to its true dimensions;
and that this had been adopted, with some va,-
riations, by Eratosthenes, Strabo, Diodorus
Siculus, and Piiny, who wrote prior to the age
of Ptolemy '.

ALTHOUGH Ptolemy was led to form such

an erroneous opinion concerning the general
dimensions of the Indian continent, his in-
formation -with respect to the country in detail,
and the situation of particular places, was more
accurate; and he is the firit author possessed
of such knowledge as enabled him to trace the
fea-coaf, to mention the most noted places
situated upon it, and to specify the longitude
and latitnde of each from Cape Comorin east-
ward, to the utmost boundary of ancient navi-
gation. WVith regard to some diltrics, par-
ticularly along the call fide of the peninsula
as far as the mouth of the Ganges, the ac-
counts which he had received seem to have
been so far exac2, as to correspond more nearly

perhaps with the aftual Rate of the country, s E.C T.
than the descriptions which he gives of any
other part of India. M. D'Anville, with his
usual industry and discernment, has confidered
the principal stations as they are fixed by him,
and finds that they correspond to Kilkare, -Ne-
gapatam, the mouth of the river Cauveri, Ma-
fulipatam, Point Gordewar., &c. It is foreign
to the obje& of this Disquisition, to enter into
such a minute detail but in several instances
we may observe, that not only the conformity
of polition, but the similarity of ancient and
modern names, is very itriking. The great
river Cauveri is by Ptolemy named Chaberis;
Arcot, in the interior country, is Arcati Regia;
and probably the whole coast has received its
present name of Coromandel from Sor Man-
dulam, or the kingdom of Sorne, which is situ-
ated upon it'.

IN the course of one hundred and thirty-fix

years, which elapsed from the death of Strabo to
that of Ptolemy, the commercial intercourse with
India was greatly extended; the latter geographer
had acquired such an accession of new intbrma
tion concerning the Ganges, that he mentions

however, of that part of India which lies
beyond the Ganges, is not less erroneous in its
general form, than that which he gave of the
peninsula, and bears as little resemblance to the
acual position of those countries. He ventures,
nevcrthelefs, upon a survey of them, similar
to that which he had made of the other great
division of India, which I have already ex,
amnined. He mentions the places of note
along the coast, some of which he difinguifhes
as Emporia; but whether that name was given
to them on account of their being staples of
trade to the natives, in their traffic carried
on from one dif:rici of India to another, or
whether they v:ere ports, to which vessels from
the Arabian Gulf resorted direaly, is not fpe-
cified. The latter I should think to be the
idea which Ptolemy means to convey; but
these regions of India were so remote, and,
from the timid and flow course of ancient
navigation, were probably so little frequented, that
his information concerning them is extremely
defe&ive, and his descriptions more obscure,
more inaccurate, and less conformable to the
real tfate of the country, than in any part of
his geography. That peninsula to which he
gives the name of the Golden Cherfonefus,

he

he delineates as if it stretched direcly from s E C T.
north to south, and fixes the latitude of Sabana
Emporium, its southern extremity, three de-
grees beyond the line. To the east of this
peninsula he places, what he call the Great
Bay, and in the most remote part of it the station
of Catigara, the utmost boundary of navigation
in ancient times, to which he assigns no less
than eight degrees and a half of southern lati-
tude. Beyond this, he declares the earth to
be altogether unknown, and asserts that the land
turns thence to the westward, and stretches in
that direcion until it joins the promontory of
Praffum in Ethiopia, which, according to his
idea, terminated the continent of Africa to
the south . In consequence of this error, no
less unaccountable than enormous, he must have
believed the Erythraean Sea, in its whole extent
from the coast of Africa to that of Cambodia,
to be a vast bafon, without any communication
with the ocean'.

I;;e F4v vellers

S C T. vellers have involved the geography of Ptolemy,

M. D'Anville has attempted to bring order;
and, with much ingenuity, he has formed opi-
nions with respect to some capital positions,
which have the appearance of being well founded.
The peninsula of Malacca is, according to him,
the Golden Cherfonefus of Ptolemy; but, in-
stead of the diretion which he has given it, we
know that it bends some degrees towards the
cast, and that Cape de Romania, its southern
extremity, is more than a degree to the north
of the line. The Gulf of Siam he confiders
as the Great Bay of Ptolemy, but the position
on the eaff fide of that Bay, corresponding to
Catigara, is a&ually as many degrees to the
north of the Equator, as he supposed it to be
south of it. Beyond this he mentions an inland
city, to which he gives the name of Thina: or
Sin;e Metropolis. The longitude which he as-
signs to it, is one hundred and eighty degrees
from his first meridi.a in the Fortunate Island,
and is the utmost point towards the East to
which the ancients had advanced by sea. Its
latitude he calculates to be three degrees south
of the line. If, with M. D'A\nville, we con-
clude the ficuation of Sin-hoa, in the western
part of the kingdom of Cochin-China, to be
Lhe fime with Sinae Metropolis, Ptolemy has

erred

erred in fixing its petition no less than fifty de- s E c T.
grees of longitude, and twenty degrees of lati- -*
tude '.

THESE errors of Ptolemy concerning the

remote parts of Afa, have been rendered more
conspicuous by a miltaken opinion of modern
times ingrafted upon them. Sine, the most
distant station mentioned in his geography, has
such a near resemblance in found, to China, the
name by which the greatest and most civilized
empire in the East is known to Europeans,
that, upon their first acquaintance with it, they
haltily concluded them to be the fame; and
of consequence it was supposed that China was
known to the ancients, though no point seems
to be more ascertained, than that they never
advanced by sea beyond that boundary which
I have allotted to their navigation.

HAVING thus traced the discoveries of India

which the ancients made by sea, I ihall next
examine what additional knowledge of that
country they acquired from their progress

by

s e T. by land. It appears (as I have formerly related)
i_ X . that there was a trade carried on early with India

through the provinces that stretch along its
northern frontier. Its various productions and
manufacures were transported by land-carriage
into the interiorparts of the Pertian dominions, or
were conveyed, by means of the navigable rivers
which flow through the Upper Asia, to the Caf-
plan Sea and from that to the Euxine. While
the successors of Seleucus retained the dominion
of the East, this continued to be the mode of
supplying their subjects with the commodities
of India. When the Romans had extended
their conquefis so far that the Euphrates was
the Eastern limit of their empire, they found
this trade fill established, and as it opened to them
a new communication with the East, by means
of which they received an additional supply of
luxuries, for which they had acquired the highest
relish, it became an obje& of their policy to
protec& and encourage it. As the progress of
the caravans or companies of merchants, which
travelled towards the countries whence they
received the most valuable manufactures, par-
ticularly those of silk, was often interrupted,
and rendered dangerous by the Parthians, who
had acquired poffeflion of all the provinces
which extend from the Caspian Sea to that part
of Scythia or Tartary which borders on China,

the

the Romansendeavoured to renderthisintercouri: s c T.
more secure by a negociation with one of thl ,.-,
monarchs of that great empire. Of this fin-
gular tranfation there is, indeed, no vefiige in
the Greek or Roman writers; our knowledge
of it is derived entirely from the Chinese bis-
torians, by whom we are informed that An.
toun, (the Emperor Marcus Antoninus,) the
king of the people of the Western Ocean, fen;
an embassy with this view to Oun-ti, who reigned
over China in the hundred and fixty-fixth year
of the Chrifiian era . What was the success
of this attempt is not known, nor can we fay
whether it facilitated such an intercourse between
these two remote nations as contributed towards
the supply of their mutual wants. The design
certainly was not unworthy of the enlightened
emperor of Rome to whom it is ascribed.

IT is evident, however, that in prosecuting

this trade with China, a considerable part of
the extensive countries to the east of the Caf-
pian Sea must have been traversed; and though
$he chief inducement to undertake those distant
journies was gain, yet, in the course of ages,

could turn their attention from commercial ob-
jecs to those of more general concern. From
them such information was procured, and fubjeced
to scientific discussion, as enabled Ptolemy to give
a description of those inland and remote regions
of Asia , fully as accurate as that of several
countries, of which, from their vicinity, he may
have been supposed to have received more dif-
tin& accounts. The farthest point towards the
East, to which his knowledge of this part of
Asia extended, is Sera Metropolis, which, from
various circumstances, appears to have been
in the fame situation with Kant-cheou, a city
of some note in Chen-fi, the most westerly pro-
vince of the Chinese empire. This he places
in the longitude of one hundred and seventy-
seven degrees fifteen minutes, near three degrees
to the weft of Sina Metropolis, which he had
described as the utmost limit of Asia discovered
by sea. Nor was Ptolemy's knowledge of this
diftri& of Asia confined only to that part of it
through which the caravans may be supposed
to have proceeded directly in their route east-
ward; he had received likewise some general
information concerning various nations towards

he gives them, occupied parts of the great _ ,
plain of Tartary, extending considerably beyond
Laffa,'the capital of Thibet, and the residence
of the Dalai Lama.

THE latitudes of several places in this part

of Asia are fixed by Ptolemy with such uncom-
mon precision, that we can hardly doubt of
their having been ascertained by acual obferva-
tion. Out of many instances of this, I shall
fele& three, of places situated in very different
parts of the country under review. The lati-
tude of Nagara, on the river Cophenes, (the
modern Attock,) is, according to Ptolemy,
thirty-two degrees and thirty minutes, which
co-incides precisely with the observation of an
Eastern geographer quoted by M. D'Anville'.
The latitude of Maracanda, or Samarcand, as
fixed by him, is thirty-nine degrees fifteen mi-
nutes. According to the Aitronomical Tables of
Ulug Beg, the grandson of Timur, whose royal
residence was in that city, it is thirty-nine de-
grees thirty-feven minutes . The latitude of
Sera Metropolis, in Ptolemy, is thirty-eight
degrees fifteen minutes; that of Kant-cheou,

as

s EC T. as determined by the Jesuit Mifilonaries, is
a-- _ 'thirty-nine degrees. I have enumerated there

striking examples of the co-incidence of his cal-
culations with those eftabliihed by modern ob-
servations, for two reasons; One, because they
clearly prove that there remote parts of Asia
had been examined with some considerable
degree of attention; the other, because I feel
great fatisfation, after having been obliged to
mention several errors and defects in Ptolemy's
'geography, in rendering jufice to a philosopher,
who has contributed so much towards the im-
provement of that science. The faas which
1 have produced afford the ftrongert evidence
of the extent of his information, as well as
the justness of his conclusions concerning coun-
tries with which, from their remote situation, we
might have supposed him to be least acquainted.

HITHERTO I have confined my researches

concerning the knowledge which the an-
cients had of India, to the continent; I return
now to confider the discoveries which they had
made, of the illands situated in various parts
of the ocean with which it is surrounded, and
begin, as I proposed, with Taprobane, the great-
eft and most valuable of them. This island lay
ib directly in the course of navigators who ven-
tured beyond Cape Comorin, especially when,

4 according

according to the ancient mode of failing, they s t e i.
seldom ventured far from the coast, that its -^.
position, one should have thought, muiR have
been determined with the utmost precision.
There is, however, hardly any point in the geo-
graphy of the ancients more undecided and un-
certain. Prior to the age of Alexander the
Great, the name of Taprobane was unknown
in Europe. In consequence of the active cu-
riofity with which he explored every coun-
try that he subdued or visited, some information
concerning it seems to have been obtained.
From his time almost every writer on geogra-
phy has mentioned it, but their accounts of it
are so various, and often so contradictory, that
we can scarcely believe them to be describing
the fame island. Strabo, the earliest writer now
extant, from whom we have any particular ac-
count of it, affirms that it was as large as Bri-
tain, and situated at the distance of seven days,
according to oine reports, and according to
other, of twenty days failing from the southern
extremity of the Indian peninsula; from which,
contrary to what is known to be its real po-
fition, he describes it as firetching towards the
the weft above five hundred tadia'. Pompo-
nius Mela, the author next in order of time, is

uncertain

s E c T. uncertain whether he should confider Taprobane
*I-,. as an ifand, or as the beginning of another

world; but as no person, he fays, had ever
failed round it, he seems to incline towards the
latter opinion d. Pliny gives a more ample de-
scription of Taprobane, which, inflead of bring-
ing arty accelion of light, involves every thing
relating to it in additional obscurity. After
enumerating the various and discordant opinions
of the Greek writers, he informs us, that am-
bafladors were sent by a king of that island to
the emperor Claudius, from whom the Romans
learned several things concerning it, which were
formerly unknown ; particularly that there were
five hundred towns in the island, and that in the
centre of it there was a lake three hundred and
feventy-five miles in circumference. These
ambaffidors were astonished at the fight of the
Great Bear and the Pleiades, being conitellations
which did not appear in their sky; and were
f'll more amazed when they beheld their shadows
point towards the north, and the fun rife on their
left hand, and set on their right. They affirmed
too, that in their country the moon was never
ieen until the eighth day after the change, and
continued to be vilible only to the sixteenth'.
It is surprising to find an author so intelligent
4 Dc Situ Orbis, lib. iii. c. 7. ' Nat. Iift. lib. vi. c. .z.

4 as

as Pliny relating all these circumstances without S E C T.
animadverfiorr, and particularly that he does not - .
take notice, that what the ambassadors re-
ported concerning the appearance of the moon,
could not take place in any region of the earth.

PTOLEMY, though so near to the age of Pliny,

seems to have been altogether unacquainted with
his description of Taprobane, or with the em-
baffy to the emperor Claudius. He places that
island opposite to Cape Comorin, at no great
distance from the continent, and delineates it
as stretching from north to south no less than
fifteen degrees, two of which he supposes to be
south of the Equator; and if his representation
of its dimensions had been just, it was well in-
titled from its magnitude to be compared with
Britains. Agathemerus, who wrote after Pto-
lemy, and was well acquainted with his geogra-
phy, confiders Taprobane as the largest of all
islands, and assigns to Britain only the second
place '.

FROM this diversity of the descriptions given
by ancient writers, it is not surprising that the

1 Lib. ii. c. S. apud Hudson. Geogr. Minor. vol. ii.

£1 moderns

s E C T. moders should have entertained very different

._. sentiments with refpea to the island in the In-

dian ocean which was to be confidered as the
fame with the Taprobane of the Greeks and
Romans. As both Pliny and Ptolemy describe
it as lying in part to the south of the Equator,
some learned men maintain Sumatra to be the
island which corresponds to this description.
But the great distance of Sumatra from the pe-
ninfula of India does not accord with any ac-
count which the Greek or Roman writers have
given of the situation of Taprobane, and we
have no evidence that the navigation of the
ancients ever extended so far as Sumatra. The
opinion more generally received is, that the
Taprobane of the ancients is the island of Cey-
lon; and not only its vicinity to the continent
of India, but the general form of the island, as
delineated by Ptolemy, as well as the position
of several places in it, mentioned by him, efta-
blifh this opinion (notwithstanding some ex-
traordinary mistakes, of which I shall afterwards
take notice) with a great degree of certainty.

THE other islands to the east of Taprobane,

mentioned by Ptolemy, might be shewn (iffuch
a detail were necessary) to be the Andaman
and Nicobr;r Tflands in the Gulf of Bengal.

S AFTER

AFTER this long, and, I am afraid, tedious in- s E C T.

veftigation of the progress made by the ancients, .,---j
in exploring the different parts of India, and
after tracing them as far as they anvanced to-
wards the East, either by sea or land, I shall
offer rome general remarks concerning the mode
in which their discoveries were conducted, and
the degree of confidence with which we may
rely on the accounts of them, which could not
have been offered with the fame advantage
until this investigation was finiihed.

THE art of delineating maps, exhibiting either

the figure of the whole earth, as far as it had
been explored, or that of particular countries,
was known to the ancients; and without the
use of them to assist the imagination, it was
impossible to have formed a diftin& idea either
of the one or of the other. Some of these maps
are mentioned by Herodotus, and other early
Greek writers. But no maps prior to those
which were formed in order to illustrate the
geography of Ptolemy, have reached our times,
in consequence of which it is very difficult to
conceive what was the relative situation of the
different places mentioned by the ancient
geographers, unless when it is precisely
ascertained by measurement h. As soon, how-

h See NOTE XXXIV.

H 2 ever,

s E C T. ever, as the mode of marking the situation

of each place by Specifying its longitude and
latitude was introduced, and came to be ge-
nerally adopted, every position could be de-
fcribed in compendious and scientific terms.
But still the accuracy of this new method, and
the improvement which geography derived from
it, depends upcn the mode in which the ancients
cilimated the latitude and longitude of places.

THOUGH the ancients proceeded in derermin-

ing the latitude and iongikude of places upon
ile fame principles with the moderns, yet it
twas by means of instruments very inferior in
their conftrution to those now used, and with-
out the fame minute attention to every circum-
tiance that may assec' the accuracy of an ob-
lervation, an attention of which long experience
only can demroonftrate the necessity. In order to
aicertain the latitude of any place, the ancients
observed the meridian altitude of the iun, either
)by means of the shadow of a perpendicular
gnomon, or by means cf an a:rolabe, from
w- .:h it was easy to compute how many de-
grees and minutes the place of obi:rvation
w.;s difRant fioni the Equator. When neither of
these methlo; could be employed, they inferred
the latitude of any place from the bell accounts
which they could procure ,f r:'e k.igth of its

WITH refpet to determining the longitude s E C T.

iL

of any place, they were much more at a loss, *
as there was only one set of celestial phenomena
to which they could have recourse. These
were the eclipses of the moon (for those of the
fun were not then so well understood as to be
subservient to the purposes of geography): the
difference between'the time at which an eclipse
was observed to begin or to end at two dif-
ferent places, gave immediately the difference
between the meridians of those places. But
the difficulty of making those obfervatiohs with
accuracy, and the impossibility of repeating
them often, rendered them of so little use in
geography, that the ancients in determining lon-
gitudes were obliged, for the molt part, to have
recourse to actual surveys, or to the vague in-
formation which was to be obtained from the
reckonings of tailors, or the itineraries of tra-
vellers.

BUT. though the ancients, by means of the

operations which I have mentioned, could
determine the position of places with a
considerable degree of accuracy at land, it is
very uncertain whether or not they had any
proper mode of determining this at 1ea. The
navigators of antiquity teem rarely to have had

H 3 recourle

S E c T. recourse to astronomical observation. They

11.
-- -~~ had no instruments suited to a moveable and

unsteady observatory; and though by their prac-
tice of landing frequently, they might, in some
measure, have supplied that defect, yet no an-
cient author, as far as I know, has given an ac-
count of any astronomical observation made by
them during the course of their voyages. It
seems to be evident from Ptolemy, who employs
some chapters in shewing how geography may
be improved, and its errors may be rectified,
from the reports of navigators', that all their
calculations were founded solely upon reckoning,
and were not the result of observation. Even
after all the improvements which the moderns
have made in the science of navigation, this
mode of computing by reckoning is known
to be fe loose and uncertain, that, from it alone,
no conclunon can be deduced with any great de-
gree of precision. Among the ancients, this inac-
curacy muit have been greatly augmented, as
they were accustomed in their voyages, instead
of fleering a direct course which might have
been more eafly measured, to a circuitous
navigation along the coast; and were unac-
quainted with t..e compals, or any other inftru-
ii;cnr by which its bearings mighit have been

ascertained. We find, accordingly, the position s E C T.

II.

of many places which we may suppose to have -
been determined at Tea, fixed with little exa&nefs.
When, in consequence of an active trade, the
ports of any country were much frequented, the
reckonings of different navigators may have
served in some measure to correct each other,
and may have enabled geographers to form their
conclusions with a nearer approximation to
truth. But in remote countries, which have
neither been the feat of military operations, nor
explored by caravans travelling frequently
through them, every thing is more vague and
undefined, and the resemblance between the
ancient descriptions of them, and their actual
figure, is often so faint that it can hardly be
traced. The latitude of places too, as might
be expected, was in general much more ac-
curately known by the ancients than their lon-
gitude. The observations by which the former
was determined are simple, made with ease,
and are not liable to much error. The other
cannot be ascertained precisely, without more
complex operations, and the use of instruments
much more perfec than any that the ancients
seem to have poffeffedk. Among the vast number

_*. -- to truth in the longitude of any one, as he has

done in fixing the latitude of the three cities
which I formerly mentioned as a striking,
though not finguiar, inslance of his exactness.

THESE observations induce me to adhere to

an opinion, which I proposed in another place',
that the Greeks and Romans, in their commercial
intercourse with India, were seldom led, either
by curiosity or the love of gain, to visit the
imore eastern parts of it. A variety of parti-
culars occur to confirm this opinion. Though
Ptolemy bestows the appellation of Emporia
on several places situated on the coast, which
stretches from the eastern mouth of the Ganges
to the extremity of the Golden Cherobnefus, it
is uncertain, whether from his having given
them this name, we are to confider them as
harbours frequented by Ihips from Egypt, or
merely by vessels of the country. Beyond the
Golden Cherfonefus, it is remarkable that he
mentions one Em,.pori!um only", which plainly
indicates the intercourse with this region of In-
cia to have been very inconsiderable. Had
voyages from the Arabian Gulf to those coun-
tr;.s of India been as frequent, as to have in-

titled

titled Ptolemy to specify so minutely the Ion- S E C T.
gitude and latitude of the great number of
places which he mentions, he muff, in confe-
quence of this, have acquired such information
as would have prevented several great errors
into which he has fallen. Had it been usual to
double Cape Comorin, and to fail up the Bay
of Bengal to the mouth of the Ganges, some of
the ancient geographers would not have been
so uncertain, and others so widely mistaken, with
refped to the situation and magnitude of the
island of Ceylon. If the merchants of Alex-
andria had often visited the ports of the Gol-
den Cherfonefus, and of the Great Bay, Pto-
lemy's descriptions of them must have been ren-
dered more correspondent to their real form,
nor could he have believed several places to lie
beyond the line, which are in truth some degrees
on this fide of it.

BUT though the navigation of the ancients

may not have extended to the farther India,
we are certain that various commodities of that
country were imported into Egypt, and thence
were conveyed to Rome, and to other parts
of the empire. From circumstances which I
have already enumerated, we are warranted in
concluding, that these were brought in vessels of
the country to Mufiris, and to the other ports on

the

s E C T. the Malabar coast, which were, at that period,

IL
* .* the staples of trade with Egypt. In a country

of such extent as India, where the natural pro-
dutions are various, and greatly diverififed by
art and industry, an acive domestic commerce,
both by sea and by land, muff have early taken
place among its different provinces. Of this
we have some hints in ancient authors; and
where the sources of information are so few
and so scanty, we must ref satisfied with hints.
Among the different clafies or casts, into which
the people of India were divided, merchants are
mentioned as one ", from which we may con-
clude trade to have been one of the established
occupations of men in that country. From the
Author of the Circumnavigation of the Ery-
tllrxan Sea, we learn that the inhabitants of the
Coromandel coast traded in vessels of their own
v.ith those of Malabar; that the interior trade
of Barygaza was considerable and that there
was, at all seasons, a number of country ships
to be found in the harbour of Mufiris . By
Strabo we are informed, that the most valuable
productions of Taprobane were carried to dif-
ferent Emporia of India P. In this way the
traders from Egypt might be supplied with
them, and thus could finish their voyages within

the

the year, which must have been protracted much s E c T.
longer if they had extended as far towards the AM,-
East as is generally supposed.

FROM all this it appears to be probable, that

Ptolemy derived the information concerning the
eastern parts of India, upon which he founds his
calculations, not so much from any dire& and
regular intercourse between Egypt and these
countries, as from the reports of a few adven-
turers, whom an enterprising spirit, or the love
of gain, prompted to proceed beyond the usual
limits of navigation.

THOUGH, from the age of Ptolemy, the trade

with India continued to be carried on in its for-
mer channel, and both Rome, the ancient
capital of the empire, and Constantinople, the
new feat of government, were supplied with the
precious commodities of that country by the
merchants of Alexandria, yet, until the reign of
the emperor Justinian, we have no new
information concerning the intercourse with the
East by lea, or the progress which was made in
the discovery of its remote regions. Under
Justinian, Cofmas, an Egyptian merchant, in
the course of his traffic, made some voyages
to Ind:a, whence he acquired the firname of
indicopleuftes; but afterwards, by a transition

not

S T c T. not uncommon in that superstitious age, he re-
-z- . nounced all the concerns of this life, and aflumed

the monatic character. In the folicude and lei-
sure of a cell, he composed several works, one
of which, dignified by him with the name of
Cbriliian Topfgraapby, has' reached us. The
main design of it is to combat the opinion of
tlole philosophers, who assert the earth to be
ofa spherical figure, and to prove that it is an
cblong plane, of twelve thousand miles in length
from east to weft, and of fix thousand miles in
breadth from north to south, surrounded by

more suited to the credulity of his new profef-
sion, than to the found sense charatderiftic of that
in which he was formerly engaged, Cofmas seems
to relate what he himself had observed in his tra-
vels, or what he had learned from others, with
great simplicity and regard for truth.

the weft coast of the Indian peninsula, and names '.-- -
several places situated upon it; he describes it
as the chief feat of the pepper trade, and men-
tions Male, in particular, as one of the molf
frequented ports on that accountr. From Male,
it is probable that this fide of the continent has
derived its modern name of Malabar; and the
cluster of islands contiguous to it, that of the
Maldives. From him too we learn, that the
island of Taprobane, which he supposes to lie
at an equal distance from the Persian Gulf on
the weft, and the country of the Sine on the
east, had become, in consequence of this com-
modious situation, a great staple of trade; that
into it were imported the silk of the Sing, and
the precious spices of the Eastern countries,
which were conveyed thence to all parts of
India, to Persia, and to the Arabian Gulf. To
this island he gives the name of Sielediba',
nearly the fame with that of Selendib, or Se-
rendib, by which it is still known all over the
East.

To Cofmas we are also indebted for the first -

information of a new rival to the Romans in
trade having appeared in the Indian seas. The

Persians,

s I C T. Persians, after having overturned the empire
Xy , of the Parthians, and re-established the line of

their ancient monarchs, seem to have surmounted
entirely the aversion of their ancestors to maritime
exertion, and made early and vigorous efforts
in order to acquire a Ihare in the lucrative com-
merce with India. All its considerable ports
were frequented by traders from Persia, who,
in return for some produaions of their own
country in request among the Indians, received
the precious commodities, which they conveyed
up the Persian Gulf, and by means of the great
rivers, Euphrates and Tigris, distributed them
through every province of their empire. As
the voyage from Persia to India was much
shorter than that from Egypt, and attended with
less expence and danger, the intercourse between
the two countries increased rapidly. A cir-
cumftance is mentioned by Cofinas which is a
striking proof of this. In most of the cities of any
note in India he found Christian churches efta-
blilhed, in which the funcions of religion were
performed by priests ordained by the archbishop
of Seleucia, the capital of the Persian empire,
and who continued fubje& to his jurifdition'.
India appears to have been more thoroughly
explored at this period, than it was in the age

of

of Ptolemy, and a greater number of strangers S E T.
seem to have been fettled there. It is remark- v_-
able, however, that, according to the account
of Cofmas, none of these firangers were accuf-
tomed to visit the eastern regions of Asia, but
refted satisfied with receiving their silk,
their spices, and other valuable produ&ions,
as they were imported into Ceylon, and con-
veyed thence to the various marts of India .

THE frequency of open hostilities between the

emperors of Constantinople and the monarchs
of Persia, together with the increasing rivalfhip
of their fubjeas in the trade with India, gave
rife to an event which produced a considerable
change in the nature of that commerce. As
the use of silk, both in dress and furniture,
became gradually more general in the court of
the Greek emperors, who imitated and furparNed
the sovereigns of Aia in splendour and mag-
nificence; and as China, in which, according to
the concurring testimony of Oriental writers,
the culture of silk was originally known , still
continued to be the only country which pro-
duced that valuable commodity: the Persians,
improving the advantages which their situation

gave

s z c T. gave them over the merchants from the Arabian
* , J GGulf, supplanted them in all the marts of India

to which silk was brought by sea from the East.
Having it likewise in their power to moleit or
to cut off the caravans, which, in order to pro-
cure a supply for the Greek empire, travelled
by land to China through the northern provinces
of their kingdom, they entirely engrossed that
branch of commerce. Constantinople was ob-
liged to depend on a rival power for an article
which luxury viewed and desired as essential
to elegance. The Perlians, with the usual ra-
pacity of monopolists, railed the price of silk
to such an exorbitant heightY, that Jultinian,
eager not only to obtain a full and certain supply
of a commodity which was become of indifpen-
fable use, but solicitous to deliver the com-
merce of his fubjec's from the examions of his
enemies, endeavoured, by means of his ally,
the ChrifRian monarch of Abyfinia, to wrest
some portion of the silk trade from the Persians.
In this attempt he failed; but when he least ex-
A D5. peded it, he, by an unforeseen event, attained,

in some measure, the objec' which he had in
view. Two Persian monks having been em-
ployed as mifTionaries in some of the Christian
churches, which were eftablifled (as we are in-

j

formed by Cofmas) in different parts of India, s Ec T.
had penetrated into the country of the Seres, --
or China. There they observed the labours
of the silk-worm, and became acquainted with
all the arts of man in working up its productions
into such a variety of elegant fabrics. The
profpet of gain, or perhaps an indignant zeal,
excited by feeing this lucrative branch of com-
merce engrossed by unbelieving nations, prompted
them to repair to Constantinople. There they
explained to the emperor the origin of silk, as
well as the various modes of preparing and ma-
nufaturing it, mysteries hitherto unknown, or
very imperfectly understood, in Europe; and
encouraged by his liberal promises, they under-
took to bring to the capital a fuflicient number
of those wonderful insets, to whose labours
man is so much indebted. This they accom-
plifhed by conveying the eggs of the silk-worm
in a hollow cane. Thiey were hatched by the
heat of a dunghill, fed with the leaves of a wild
mulberry tree, and they muiciplied and worked
in the fame manner as in those climates where
they first became objects of human attention
and care z. Vast numbers of there mnfects were
soon reared in different parts of Greece, particu-
larly in the Peloponefus. Sicily afterwards under-

towns of Italy. In all these places extensive
manufactures were established, and carried on,
with silk of domestic production. The demand
for silk from the East diminished of course, the
fubjeds of the Greek emperors were no longer
obliged to have recourse to the Persians for a
supply of it, and a considerable change took
place in the nature of the commercial intercourse
between Europe and India'.

ABOUT fourscore years after the death of s E C T.

Justinian, an event happened, which occa- '-r-

sioned a revolution frill more considerable in the
intercourse of Europe with the East. Mahomet,
by publishing a new religion, seems to have ani-

have call.d forth latent paflions and talents into
e exrtion The greatcft part of the Arabians,

I 2 satisfied

s E C T. satisfied from the earliest times with national in-

- ,-... dependence and perlbnal liberty, tended their

camels, or reared their palm-trees, within the
precincts of their own peninsula, and had little
intercourse with the reft of mankind, unless
when they sallied out to plunder a caravan, or
to rob a traveller. In some diftriEts, however,
they had begun to add the labours of agricul-
ture, and the business 'of commerce, to the oc-
cupations of pafloral life . These different
orders of men, when prompted by the enthu.
fiaftic ardour with which the exhortations and
example of Mahomet inspired them, displayed,
at once, all the zeal of miflionaries, and the
ambition of conquerors. They ipread the doc-
trine of their prophet, and extended the domi-
nion of his successors, from the shores of the
Atlantic to the frontier of China, with a ra-
pidity of success to which there is nching similar
A.D. 64.. in the history of mankind. Fgypt was one of

their earliest conquests; and as they fettled in
that inviting country, and kept pofflilon of it,
the Greeks were excludcd from ail intercourse
with Alexandria, to which they had long re-
forted as the chief mart of Indian goods. Nor
was this the only effect which the progress of
the Mahomedan arms had upon the commerce

of

of Europe with India. Prior to their invasion s E c T.
of Egypt, the Arabians had subdued the great --
kingdom of Persia, and added it to the empire
of their Caliphs. They found their new sub-
jeas engaged in prosecuting that extensive trade
with India, and the country to the east of it, the
commencement and progress of which in Persia
I have already mentioned; and they were so
sensible of the great advantages derived from it,
that they became desirous to partake of them.
As the acive powers of the human mind, when
roused to vigorous exertions in one line, are
most capable of operating with force in other
dire&ions; the Arabians, from impetuous war-
riors, soon became enterprising merchants.
They continued to carry on the trade with
India in its former channel from the Persian
Gulf, but it was with that ardour which cha-
raaterizes all the early efforts of Mahomet's
followers. In a short time they advanced far
beyond the boundaries of ancient navigation,
and brought many of the most precious com-
modities of the East direcly from the countries
which produced them. In order to engross all
the profit arising from the sale of them, the
Caliph Omar b, a few years after the conquest
of Persia, founded the city of Baffora, on the

I 3 western

S ECL T. western banks of the great stream formed by.
*-- , the juntion of the Euphrates and Tigris, with

a view of securing the command of these two
rivers, by which goods imported from India
were conveyed into all parts of Asia. With
such discernment was the situation chosen, that
Baffora soon became a place of trade hardly in-
ferior to Alexandria.

THIS general information with refpe& to the

trade of the Arabians with India, which is all
that can be derived from the historians of that
period, is confirmed and illustrated by the Re-
lation of a Voyage from the Persian Gulf to-
wards the East, written by an Arabian merchant
in the year of the Christian era eight hundred
and fifty-one, about two centuries after Perlia
was subjected to the Caliphs, and explained by
the Commentary of another Arabian, who had
likewise visited the Eastern parts of Asia'. This
curious Relation, which enables us to fill up a
chasm in the history of mercantile communica-
tion with India, furnishes materials for defcrib-
ing more in detail the extent of the Arabian
discoveries in the East, and the manner in which
they made them.

THOU G

THOUGH some have imagined that the won- 5s . T.

derful property of the magnet, by which it -r
communicates such virtue to a needle or slender
rod of iron, as to make it point towards the
poles of the earth, was known in the East long
before it was observed in Europe, it is manifest,
both from the Relation of the Mahometan mer-
chant, and from much concurring evidence,
that not only the Arabians, but the Chinese,
were destitute of this faithful guide, and that
their mode of navigation was not more adven-
trous than that of the Greeks and Romans".
They steered servilely along the coast, seldom
stRetching out to sea so far as to lose fight of
land, and as they shaped their course in this
timid manner, their mode of reckoning was
defeftive, and liable to the fame errors which
I observed in that of the Greeks and Ro-
mans '.

N6TWITHSTANDING these disadvantages, the

progress of the Arabians towards the East ex-
tended far beyond the Gulf of Siam, the
boundary of European navigation. They
became acquainted with Sumatra, and the

China. Nor are these discoveries to be con-
fidered as the effEtc of the enterprising curiosity
of individuals; they were owing to a regular
commerce carried on from the Persian Gulf
with China, and all the intermediate countries.
Many Mahomedan:, imitating the example of
the Persians described by Cofmas Indicopleuftes,
fettled in India and the countries beyond it.
They were so numerous in the city of Canton,
that the emperor (as the Arabian authors relate)
permitted them to have a Cadi or judge of their
own seA, who decided controversies among his
countrymen by their own laws, and presided in
all the funcions of religion'. In other places
proselytes were gained to the Mahomedan faith,
and the Arabian language was understood and
spoken in almost every sea-port of any note.
Ships from China and different places of India
traded in the Persian Gulfg, and by the fre-
quency of mutual inrercourfe, all the nations
of the East became better acquainted with each
other h.

A STRIKI;'G proof of this is the new informa-

the two authors I have mentioned. They point s X c T.
out the situation of Canton, now so well known _
to Europeans, with a considerable degree of
exatnefs. They take notice of the general use
of silk among the Chinese. They are the first
who mention their celebrated manufacure of
porcelane, which, on account of its delicacy
and transparency, they compare to glass'. They
describe the tea-tree, and the mode of using its
leaves; and from the great revenue which was
levied (as they inform us) from the consumption
of it, tea seems to have been as universally the
favourite beverage of the Chinese in the ninth
century, as it is at present k.

EVEN with refpet to those parts of India

which the Greeks and Romans were accustomed
to visit, the Arabians had acquired more per-
set information. They mention a great empire
eftablilhed on the Malabar coast, governed by
monarchs whose authority was paramount to that
of every power in India. These monarchs were
distinguished by the appellation of Balchara, a
name yet known in India', and it is probable
that the Samorin, or emperor of Calicut, so
frequently mentioned in the accounts of the first

voyages

S E c T. voyages of the Portuguese to India, possessed

-,-O' some portion of their dominions. They cele-

brate the extraordinary progress which the In-
dians had made in astronomical knowledge, a
circumstance which seems to have been little
known to the Greeks and Romans, and aflert
that in this branch of science they were far fu-
perior to the mot enlightened nations of the
East, on which account their sovereign was
denominated the King of Wifdomm. Other
peculiarities in the political institutions, the
mode of judicial proceedings, the pastimes, and
the fuperflitions of the Indians, particularly the
excruciating mortifications and penances of the
faquirs, might be produced as proofs of the
superior knowledge which the Arabians had ac-
quired of the manners of that people.

THE fame commercial spirit, or religious

zeal, which prompted the Mahomedans of
Persia to visit the remotest regions of the East,
animated the Christians of that kingdom. The
Neftorian churches planted in Persia, under the
prote&ion first of its native sovereigns, and
afterwards of its conquerors the Caliphs, were
numerous, and governed by refpe&table eccle-
fiaftics. They had early lent missionaries into

India, and eftablithed churches in different parts S E c T.
of it, particularly, as I have formerly related, in *-.-
the Island of Ceylon. When the Arabians ex-
tended their navigation as far as China, a more
ample field, both for their commerce and their
zeal, opened to their view. If we may rely on
the concurring evidence of Christian authors,
in the East as well as in the Weft, confirmed
by the testimony of the two Mahomedan tra,
vellers, their pious labours were attended with
f'ch success, that in the ninth and tenth centu-
ries the number of Christians in India and China
was very confi.erable . As the churches in
both these countries received all their eccle-
fiafics from Persia, where they were ordained
by the Catbolicos, or Neftorian Primate, whose
supremacy they acknowledged, this became a
regular channel of intercourse and intelligence;
and to the combined effect of all these circum-
itances, we are indebted for the information we
receive from the two Arabian writers", con-
cerning those regions of Asia which the Greeks
and Romans never visited.

X.-my., found themselves excluded almost entirely from

any intercourse with it. To them the great
port of Alexandria was now shut, and the ;,'e
lords of the Persian Gulf, satisfied with supply.
ing the demand for Indian commodities in their
own extensive dominions, neglectcd to convey
them, by any of the usual channels, to the
trading towns on the Mediterranean. The
opulent inhabitants of Constantinople, and other
great cities of Europe, bore this deprivation of
luxuries, to which they had been long accuf-
tomed, with such impatience, that all the a&i-
vity of tommerce was exerted, in order to find
a remedy for an evil which they deemed in-
tolerable. The difficulties which were to be
surmounted in order to accomplish this, afford
the most striking proof of the high estimation
in which the commodities of the East were held
at that time. The silk of China was purchased
in Chenfi, the westernmost province of that
empire, and conveyed thence by a caravan, in
a march of eighty or a hundred days, to the
banks of the Oxus, where it was embarked, and
carried down the itream of that river to the
Caspian. After a dangerous voyage across that
lea, and ascending the river Cyrus as far as it is
navigable, it was conduaed by a short land-

carriage

carriage of five days to the river Phafis P, which s tl T.
falls into the Euxine or Black Sea. Thence, -_-
by an easy and well known course, it was tran-
lported to Constantinople. The conveyance of
commodities from that region of the East, now
known by the name of Indoftan, was fomewlat
less tedious and operose. They were carried
from the banks of the Indus, by a route early
frequented, and which I have already described,
either to the river Oxus, or dire&ly to the Caf.
pian, from which they held the fame course to
Conttantinople.

IT is obvious, that only commodities offmall

bulk, and of considerable value, could bear the
expence of such a mode of conveyance; and in
regulating the price of those commodities, not
only the expence, but the rifque and danger of
conveying them, were to be taken into account.
In their journey across the vast plain extending
from Samarcande to the frontier of China, cara-
vans were exposed to the aflaults and depreda-
tions of the Tartars, the Huns, the Turks, and
other roving tribes which infest the north-east
of Asia, and which have always confidered the
merchant and traveller as their lawful prey; nor
were they exempt from insult and pillage in their

journey

S E C T. journey from the Cyrus to the Phafis, through

-, a » the kingdom of Colchis, a country noted, both

in ancient and in modern times, for the thievish
disposition of its inhabitants. Even under all
there disadvantages, the trade with the East was
carried on with ardour. Constantinople became
a considerable mart of Indian and Chinese cam-
modities, and the wealth which flowed into it
in confcquence of this, not only added to the
fpiendour of that great city, but seems to have
retarded, for some rime, the decline of the em-
pire of which it was the capital.

As far as we may venture to conjecture, from

the imperfe& information of contemporary hifto-
rians, it was chiefly by the mode of conveyance
which I have described, perilous and operose as
it was, that Europe was supplied with the com-
modities of the East, during more than two
centuries. Throughout that period the Christians
and Mahomedans were engaged in almoff unin-
terrupted hostilities; profecutel with all the
animosity which rivalfhip for power, heightened
by religious zeal, naturally excites. Under cir-
cumftances which occasioned such alienation,
commercial intercourse could hardly subsist, and
the merchants of Christendom either did not
resort at all to Alexandria, and the ports of
Syria, the ancient ftaplcs for the commodities

of the East, after they were in possession of the s E c T.
Mahomedans, or if the love of gain, surmount- .
ing their abhorrence of the Infidels, prompted
them to visit the marts which they had long fre-
quented, it was with much caution and distrust.

WHILE the difficulties of procuring the pro-

duCtions of the East were thus augmented, the
people of Europe became more desirous of
obtaining them. About this time some cities
of Italy, particularly Amalphi and Venice,
having acquired a greater degree of security or
independence than they formerly possessed,
began to cultivate the arts of domestic industry,
Swith an ardour and ing enuity uncommon in the
middle ages. The effe& of these exertions was
such an increase of wealth, as created new wants
and desires, and formed a taste for elegance
and luxury, which induced them to visit foreign
countries in order to gratify it. Among men
in this stage of their advancement, the produc-
tions of India have always been held in high
estimation, and from this period they were
imported into Italy in larger quantities, and
came into more general use. Several circum-
stances which indicate this revival of a com-
mercial spirit, are colleted by the industrious
Muratori, and, from the close of the seventh

century,

s c T. century, an attentive observer may discern
* L,. faint traces of its progress P.

EVEN in enlightened ages, when the tranf.

acions of nations are observed and recorded
with the greatest care, and the store of historical
materials seems to be abundantly ample, so litde
attention has been paid to the operations of
commerce, that every attempt towards a re-
gular deduction of them, has been found an
undertaking of the utmost difficulty. The ara,
however, to which I have conducted this Dif-
quifition, is one of the periods in the annals
of mankind concerning which history furnishes
most scanty information. As it was chiefly in the
Greek empire, and in some cities of Italy, that
any efforts were made to procure the com-
modities of India, and the other regions of the
East, it is only from the Historians of those
countries we can expe& to find any account of
that trade. But from the age of Mahomet,
until the time when the Comneni ascended the
throne of Constantinople, a period of more than
four centuries and a half, the Byzantine history
is contained in meagre chronicles, the com-

the intrigues in the palace, the fations in-the the-
atre, or the disputes of theologians. To them the
monkish annalists of the different states and
cities of Italy, during the fame period, are (if
possible) far inferior in merit, and in the early
accounts of those cities which have been most
celebrated for their commercial spirit, we search
with little success for the origin or nature of that
trade by which they first rose to eminence'.
It is manifest, however, from the slightest at-
tention to the events which happened in the
seventh and eighth centuries, that the Italian
states, while their coasts were continually in-
fested by the Mahomedans, who had made some
settlements there, and had fubjeted Sicily almost
entirely to their dominion, could not trade with
much confidence and security in Egypt and
Syria. With wat implacable hatred Christians
viewed Mahomedans, as the disciples of an im-
poftor, is well known; and as all the nations
which professed the Chriflian faith, both in the
East and Weft, had mingled the worlhip of
angels and faints with that of the Supreme
Being, and had adorned their churches with
pitures and flatues; the true Moslems con-
fidered themselves as the only affertors of the

Much time was requisite to soften this mutual
animosity, so far as to render intercourse in any
degree cordial.

M.EA-;WHILE a taste for the luxuries of the

Eatt continued not only to spread in Italy, but,
from initation of the Italians, or from some
improvement in their own situation, the people
of Marseilles, and other towns of France on the
Mediterranean, became equally fond of them.
But the profits exacted by the merchants of
Amalphi or Venice, from whom they received
those precious commodities, were ib exorbitant
as prompted them to make forne effort to sup-
ply their own demands. With this view, they
not only opened a trade with Constantinople,
but ventured at times to visit the ports of Egypt
and Syria'. This eagerness of the Europeans, on
the one hand, to obtain the productions of India,
and on the other hand, considerable advantages
which both the Caliphs and their fubjets
derived from the sale of them, induced both so
far to conceal their reciprocal antipathy, as to
carry on a traffic manifestly for their common
;cnefit, Iow far this traffic extended, and

in what mode it was condueted by there new S P c T.
adventurers, the scanty informationwhich can be -
gathered from contemporary writers, does not
enable me to trace with accuracy. It is pro-
bable, however, that this communication would
have produced insensibly its usual effe&, .of
familiarizing and reconciling men of hostile
principles and discordant manners to one another,
and a regular commerce might have been
eftablilhed gradually between Christians and
Mahometans, upon such equal terms, that the
nations of Europe might have received all the
luxuries of the East, by the fame channels in
which they were formerly conveyed to them,
first by the Tyrians, then by the Greeks of
Alexandria, next by the Romans, and at last
by the fubjets of the Conftantinopolitan em-
pire.

BUT whatever might have been the influence

of this growing correspondence, it was prevented
from operating with full effea by the Crusades,
or expeditions for the recovery of the Holy
Land, which, during two centuries, occupied
the professors of the two rival religions, and
contributed to alienate them more than ever
from each other. I have, in another work',

the longest continued, of any that occurs in the
history of our species; and I pointed out such
effects of it upon government, upon property,

sent my attention is confined to observe the
commercial consequences of the Crusades, and
how far they contributed to retard, or to pro-

into Europe.

To fix an idea of peculiar sanctity to that

country, which the Author of our Religion
selected as the place of his residence while on
earth, and in which he accomplished the re-
demption of mankind, is a sentiment so natural
to the human mind, that, from the first efta-
blifiment of Christianity, the visiting of the holy
places in Judea was confidered as an exercise
of piety, tending powerfully to awaken and to
cherish a spirit of devotion. Through fuc-
ceeding ages, the practice continued, and in-
creased in every part of Chrifcendom. When

tary zeal, and in both cafes it was deemed an
expiation for all past offences. From various
causes, which I have elsewhere enumerated',
there pious visits to the Holy Land multiplied
amazingly during the tenth and eleventh cen-
turies. Not only individuals in the lower and
middle ranks of life, but persons of superior
condition, attended by large retinues, and nu-
merous caravans of opulent pilgrims, resorted
to Jerusalem.

IN all their operations, however, men have

a wonderful dexterity in mingling tome attention
to interest with those funaions which seem
to be most purely spiritual. The Mahomedan
caravans, which, in obedience to the injunctions
of their religion, visit the holy temple of Mecca,
are not composed, as I fhail hereafter explain
more fully, of devout pilgrims only, but of
merchants, who, both in going and returning,
are provided with fich an aifortment of goods,
that they carry on a considerable traffic ". Even

frequent pilgrimages subservient to their interest,
by trading in every country through which
they travel'. In like manner, it was not by
devotion alone that such numerous bands of
Chriltian pilgrims were induced to visit Jerufa-
lem. To many of them commerce was the
chief motive of undertaking that distant voyage,
and by exchanging the produaions of Europe
for the more valuable commodities of Asia, par-
ticularly those of India, which at that time
were diffused through every part of the Caliphs
dominions, they enriched themselves, and fur-
nifhed their countrymen with such an additional
supply of Eaflern luxuries, as augmented their
relish for them Y.

BUT how faint soever the lines may be, which,

prior to the Crufadcs, mark the influence of
the frequent pilgrimages to the East upon com-
merce, they become so conspicuous after the
commencement ot there expeditions, as to meet
the eye of every observer. Various circum-
stances concurred towards this, from an enu.

meration

meration of which it will appear, that by attend- s E C T.
ing to the .progress and effects of the crufadles, t - _-
considerable light is thrown upon the subject
of my inquiries. Great armies, conduted by
the most illustrious princes and nobles of Europe,
and composed of men of the most enterprising
spirit in all the kingdoms of it, marched towards
Palestine, through countries far advanced beyond
those which they left, in every species of im-
provement. They beheld the dawn of pro-
tperity in the republics of Italy, which had begun
to vie with each other in the arts of industry,
and in their efforts to engross the lucrative com-
merce with the East. They next admired the
more advanced state of opulence and splendour
in Constantinople, railed to a pre-eminence
above all the cities then known, by its extensive
trade, particularly that which it carried on with
India, and the countries beyond it. They after-
wards served in those provinces of Asia through
which the commodities of the East were usually
conveyed, and became malters of several cities
which had been staples of that trade. They
established the kingdom of Jerusalem, which
subsisted near two hundred years. They tools
poffeflion of the throne of the Greek empire,
and governed it above half a century. Amidst
such a variety of events and operations, the
ideas of the fierce warriors of Europe gradually

K 4 opened

s E c T. opened and improved; they became acquainted
. , * with the policy and arts of the people whom

they subdued; they observed the fuorces of
their wealth, and availed themselves of all this
knowledge. Antioch and Tyre, when con-
quered by the Crusaders, were flourishing cities,
inhabited by opulent merchants, who supplied
all the nations trading in the Mediterranean
v.ith the producticns of the East, and as far
as can be gathered firom incidental occurrences,
mentioned by the Hifrorians of the Holy War,
who, bein n loftly pricfts and monks, had their
artcn.ion directed to cbjects very different from
thof relating to commerce, there is reason to
believe that both in Conitantinople, while subject
to the Franks, and in the ports of Syria acquired
by the Christians, the long etablifhed trade with
the East continued to be protected and en-
ccurzged.

BtrT though commerce may have been only

a fccondary object with the martial leaders
of the Crusades, engaged in perpetual hostilities
.ith the Turks on one hand, and with the Soldans
of Egypt on the other, it was the primary object
with the afibciates, in conjunction with whom

they

they carried on their operations. Numerous s E c T.
as the armies were which assumed the cross, --
and enterprising as the fanatical zeal was with
which they were animated, they could not
have accomplished their purpose, or even have
reached the feat of their warfare, without fe-
curing the afliftance of the Italian Rtates. None
of the other European powers could either fur-
nifh a sufficient nnmber of transports to convey
the armies of the Crusaders to the coast of
Dalmatia, whence they marched to Conftanti-
nople, the place of general rendezvous; or were
able to supply them with military stores and
provisions in such abundance as to enable them
to invade a distant country. In all the fuccef-
five expeditions, the fleets of the Genoese, of
the Pifans, or of the Venetians, kept on the
coast as the armies advanced by land, and sup-
plying them from time to time, with whatever
was wanting, engrofled all the profits of a branch
of commerce, which, in every age, has been
extremely lucrative. It was with all the in-
terested attention of merchants, that the Italians
afforded their aid. On the reduction of any
place in which they found it for their interest to
fettle, they obtained from the Crusaders va-
luable immunities of different kinds; freedom
of trade ; an abatement of the usual duties paid
for what was imported and exported, or a total

exemption

S E C T. exemption from them i the property of entire

f" uburbs in some cities, and of extensive fireets
in others; and a privilege granted to every
person who resided within their precin6ts, or
who traded under their prote&ion, of being
tried by their own laws, and by judges of their
own appointment'. In consequence of so
many advantages we can trace, during the pro-
grefs of the Crusades, a rapid increase of wealth
and of power in all the commercial flates of
Italy. Every port open to trade was fre-
quented by their merchants, who, having now
engrossed entirely the commerce of the East,
firove with such active emulation to find new
markets for the commodities which it furniihed,
that they extended a tafe for them to many parts
of Europe in which they had hitherto been
little known.

Two events happened, prior to the termina-

tion of the Holy War, which, by acquiring to
the Venetians and Genoese the poffcflion of
ifveral provinces in the Greek empire, enabled
them to fuijply Europe more abundantly with
all the productions of the East. The first was

Venetians, and the leaders of the fourth Crufide. s E es T.
An account of the political interests and in- v__
trigues which formed this alliance, and turned
the hallowed arms destined to deliver the Holy
City from the dominion of inhdels, against a
Christian monarch, is foreign from the design
of this Disquisition. Constantinople was taken
by storm, and plundered by the confederates.
An erl of Slanders was placed on the Imperial
throne. The dominions which itill remained sub-
je& to the successors of Constantine, were divided
into four parts, one of which being allotted to
the new emperor, for supporting the dignity
and expence of government, an equal par-
tition of the other three was made between the
Venetians, and the chiefs of the crusade. The
former, who, both in concerting and in con-
ducting this enterprize, kept their eye steadily
fixed on what might be most for the emolument
of their commerce, secured the territories of
greatest value to a trading people. They ob-
tained some part of the Peloponnefus, at that
time the feat of flourishing manufacures, par-
ticularly of silk. They became masters of
several of the largest and best cultiva;ed islands
in tile Archipelago, and established a chain
of settlements, partly military and partly com-
mercial, extending from the Adriatic to the

Bofpho-

S E c T. Bofphorusb. Many Venetians fettled in Con-

- flantinople, and without obftruc'ion from their

warlike associates, little attentive to the arts
of induitry, they engrossed the various branches
of trade which had so long enriched that capital.
Two of these particularly attracted their atten-
tion i the silk trade, and that with India. From
the reign of Justinian, it was mofily in Greece,
and some of the adjacent islands, that silk-
worms, which he first introduced into Europe,
were reared. The product of their labours
was manufactured into fluffs of various kinds
in many cities of the empire. But it was in
Constantinople, the feat of opulence and luxury,
that the demand for a commodity of Iuch high
price was greatest, and there, of conlequence,
the commerce of silk naturally centered. In
assorting cargoes for the several - ports in
which they traded, the Venetians had for some
time found silk to be an essential article, as it
continued to grow more and more into request
in every part of Europe. By the residence
of so many of their citizens in Constantinople,
and by the immunities granted to them, they
not only procured silk in such abundance, and

on

on such terms, as enabled them to carry on s E C T.
trade more extensively, and with greater profit ,-1
than formerly, but they became so thoroughly
acquainted with every branch of the silk manu-
faure, as induced them to attempt tile efta-
blifhment of it in their own dominions. The
measures taken for this purpose by individuals,
as well as the regulations framed by the state,
were concerted with so much prudence, and
executed with such success, that in a short time
the silk fabrics of Venice vied with those of
Greece and Sicily, and contributed both to
enrich the republic, and to enlarge the sphere
of its commerce. At the fame time, the Ve-
netians availed themselves of the influence which
they had acquired in Constantinople, in order
to improve their Indian trade. The capital
of the Greek empire, betides the means of
being supplied with the producions of the
Ealt, which it enjoyed in common with the
other commercial cities of Europe, received
a considerable portion of them by a channel
peculiar to itself. Some of the most valu-
able commodities of India and China were
conveyed over land, by routes which I have
described, to the Black Sea, and thence by a
short navigation to Conltantinople. To this
market, the best stored of any except Alex-
andria, the Venetians had now easy access, and
the goods which they purcha:ed there, made

an

S E C T. an addition of great consequence to what they

, -il. were accustomed to acquire in the ports of

Egypt and Syria. Thus while the Latin empire
in Constantinople subsisted, the Venetians pof-
fefled such advantages over all their rivals,
that their commerce extended greatly, and
it was chiefly from them every part of Europe
received the commodities of the East.

THE other event which I had in view, was

the subversion of the dominion of the Latins in
Constantinople, and the re-establishment of the
Imperial family on the throne. This was es-
feted after a period of fifty-feven years, partly
by a transient effort of vigour, with which
indignation at a foreign yoke animated the
Greeks, and partly by the powerful assistance
which they received from the republic of Genoa.
The Genoese were so sensible of the advantages
which the Venetians, their rivals in trade, de-
rived from their union with the Latin empe-
rors of Conflantinople, that, in order to deprive
them of there, they surmounted the most deep-
rooted prejudices of their age, and combined
with the schismatic Greeks to dethrone a mo-
narch proteced by the Papal power, setting at
defiance the thunders of the Vatican, which at
that time made the greatest princes tremble.
This undertaking, bold and impious as it was
then deemed, proved successful. In recom-

pence

pence for their signal services, the grati- E c T
tude or weakness of the Greek emperor, '-
among other donations, bestowed upon the
Genoese Pera, the chief suburb of Conitantino-
ple, to be held as a fief of the empire, toge-
ther with filch exemption from the accustomed
duties on goods imported and exported, as
gave them a decided superiority over every
competitor in trade. With the vigilant atten-
tion of merchants, the Genoese availed them-
ilves of this favourable situation. They fur-
rounded their new settlement in Pera with
fortifications. The) rendered their satories on
the adjacent coasts places of strength'. They
were maiters of the harbour of Constantinople
more than the Greeks themselves. The whole
trade of the Black Sea came into their hands;
and not satisfied with this, they took poffcfion
of part of the Cherfonefus Taurica, the mo-
dern Crimaea, and rendered Caffa, its principal
town, the chief fciat of their trade with the
East, and the port in which ail itb produaion;,
conveyed to the Black Sea by the different
routes I have formerly described, were landed'.

S E C T. IN consequence of this revolution, Genoa
.. .- became the greatest commercial power in Eu-

rope; and if the enterprising industry and in-
trepid courage of its citizens had been under
the diretion of wife domestic policy, it might
have long held that rank. But never was there
a contrast more striking, than between the in-
ternal administration of the two rival republics
of Venice and Genoa. In the former, govern-
ment was conduced with steady fyfematic
prudence; in the latter, it was confifent in
nothing but a fondness for novelty, and a pro-
pcnfity to change. The one enjoyed a perpe-
tual calm, the other was agitated with all the
forms and vicffitudes of fa&ion. The increase
of wealth, which flowed into Genoa from the
exertions of its merchants, did not counterba-
lance the defects in its political contfitution;
and even in its most profprrous itate we may
discern the appearance of symptoms which
foreboded a diminution of its opulence and
power.

As long, however, as the Genoese retained

the ascendant which they had acquired in the
Greek empire, the Venetians felt their com-
mercial transactions swith it to be carried on
upon such unequal terms, that their merchants
vifircd Conitantinople seldom, and with reluc-

tance;

tance; and in order to procure the commodities S E C T.
of the East in such quantities as were demanded I -L
in the various parts of Europe which they were
accustomed to supply, they were obliged to
retort to the ancient staples of that trade. Ofthefe
Alexandria was the chief, and the most abun-
dantly supplied, as the conveyance of Indian
goods by land through Asia, to any of the ports
of the Meditertanean, was often rendered im-
praticable by the incursions of Turks, Tartars,
and other hordes, which successively desolated
that fertile country, or contended for the dominion
of it. But under the military and vigorous govern-
ment of the Soldans of the Mameluks, security
and order were ftceadily maintained in Egypt,
and trade, though loaded with heavy duties,
was open to all. In proportion to the pro-
grefs of the Genoese, in engrossing the com-
merce of Constantinople and the Black Sea',
the Venetians found it more and more necessary
to enlarge their tranfa&tions with Alexandria.

BUT such an avowed intercourse with

infidels being confidered, in that age, as
unbecoming the charater of Christians, the
senate of Venice, in order to silence its own
scruples, or those of its fubjeas, had recourfc

I _ X- supposed to be possessed of power to dispense

with the rigorous observation of the most sacred
laws, and obtained permilfion from him to fit
out annually a specified number of ships for
the ports of Egypt and of Syria'. Under
this fantion, the republic concluded a treaty
of commerce with the Soldans of Egypt, on
equitable terms; in consequence of which the
senate appointed one consul to reside in Alex-
andria, and another in Damascus, in a public
character, and to exercise a mercantile jurif-
diction, authorised by the Soldans. Under
their protection, Venetian merchants and ar-
tifans fettled in each of these cities. Ancient
prejudices and antipathies were forgotten, and
their mutual interests established, for the first
time, a fair and open trade between Christians
and Mahomedans .

WHILE the Venetians and Genoese were

alternately making those extraordinary efforts,
in order to engross all the advantages of sup-
plying Europe with the productions of the
East, the republic of Florence, originally a
commercial democracy, applied with such per-

people, as well as the nature of their institutions, . .
were so favourable to its progress, that the
Rate advanced rapidly iripower, and the people
in opulence. But as the Florentines did not
possess any commodious sea-port, their aCive
exertions were direced chiefly towards the
improvement of their manufactures and do-
meftic industry. About the beginning of the
fourteenth century, the Florentine manufactures
of various kinds, particularly those of silk and
woollen coth, appear from the enumeration of
a well-informed Historian, to have been very
considerable . The connecion which they
formed in different parts of Europe, by fur-
nilhing them with the productions of their own
industry, led them to engage in another branch
of trade, that of banking. In this they soon
became so eminent, that the money-tranfadions
of almost every kingdom in Europe passed
through their hands, and in many of them they
were entrusted with the collection and admini-
itration of the public revenues. In consequence
of the activity and success with which they con-
ducted their manufactures and money-tranfac-

an high degree, at a period when neither the
interest of money, nor the premium on bills of
exchange, were fettled with accuracy, Florence
became one of the first cities in Christendom,

Coimo di Medici, the head of a family which
rose from obscurity by its success in trade, was
reckoned the most wealthy merchant ever
known in Europe i; and in a&s of public muni-
fcence, as well as of private generosity, in the
patronage of learning, and in the encourage-
ment of useful and elegant arts, no monarch
of the age could vie with him. Whether the
Medici, in their first mercantile tranfations,
carried on any commerce with the East, I have
not been able to discover'. It is more pro-
bable, I ihould think, that their trade was con-
lined to the fame articles with that of their
countrymen. But as soon as the common-

endeavoured to procure for his country a {hare CTe T-
in that lucrative commerce, which had raised I
Venice and Genoa so far above all the other
Italian states. With this view ambassadors A.C. 142.
were sent to Alexandria, in order to prevail
with the Soldan to open that, and the other
ports of his dominions, to the fubjeats of the
republic, and to admit them to a participation
of all the commercial privileges which were
enjoyed by the Venetians. The negociation
terminated with such success, that the Floren-
tines seem to have obtained some share in the
Indian trade'; and soon after this period, we
find spices enumerated among the commodities
imported by the Florentines into England .

IN some parts of this Disquisition, concern-

ing the nature and course of trade with the
East, I have been obliged to grope my way,
and often under the guidance of very feeble
lights. But as we are now approaching to the
period when the modern ideas, with refpea to
the importance of commerce, began to unfold,
and attention to its progress and effecs became
a more considerable object of policy, we may
hope to carry on what researches yet remain
to be made, with greater certainty and pre-
cifion. To this growing attention we are in-

-- -- a Venetian nobleman, gives of the Indian trade,

as carried on by his countrymen, about the
beginning of the fourteenth century. They
were supplied, as he informs us, with the pro-
ductions of the East in two different ways.
Those of small bulk and high value, such as
cloves, nutmegs, mace, gems, pearls, &c.
were conveyed from the Persian Gulf up the
Tigris to Baffora, and thence to Bagdat, front
which they were carried to some port on the
Mediterranean. All more bulky goods, such
as pepper, ginger, cinnamon, &c. together
with Ibme portion of the more valuable
articles, were conveyed by the ancient route
to the Red Sea, and thence acrols the defart,
and down the Nile, to Alexaniria. The goods
received by the former route were, as Sanudo
obf'rves, of filperior quality, but from the te-
dioufnefs and expence of a ditlant land-carriage,
the supply was often scanty, nor can he conceal
(though contrary to a favourite project which
he had in view when he wrote the treatise to
which I refer) that, from ihe state of the coun-
tries through which the caravans passed, this
mode of conveyance was frequently precarious,
and attended wikh danger'.

IT was in Alexandria only, that the Venetians S E c T.

found always a certain and full supply of Indian i-_-
goods and as these were conveyed thither chiefly
by water-carriage, they might have purchased
them at a moderate price, if the Soldans had
not imposed upon them duties which amounted
to a third part of their full value. Under this
and every other disadvantage, however, it was
necessary to procure them, as from many con-
curring circumstances, particularly a more ex-
tensive intercourse eftablithed among the dif-
ferent nations of Europe, the demand for them
continued to increase greatly during the four-
teenth century. By the irruptions of the va-
rious hostile tribes of Barbarians, who took
porfeffion of the greater part of Europe, that
powerful bond by which the Romans had
united together all the people of their vast
empire was entirely dissolved, and such dif-
couragement was given to the communication
of one nation with another, as would appear
altogether incredible, if the evidence of it refted
only upon the teflimony of historians, and were
not confirmed by what is till more authentic,
the express enactment of laws. Several statutes
of this kind, which disgrace the jurisprudence
of almost every European nation, I have enu-
merated and explained in another work . But

UL
i- j and they found that other countries could fur-

nifh the means of supplying and gratifying
them, the hostile sentiments which kept nations
at a distance from each other abated, and mu-
tual correspondence gradually took place. From
the time of the Crusades, which first brought
people hardly known to one another, to as-
fociate, and to a& in concert during two cen-
turies, in pursuit of one common end, several
circumstances had co-operated towards acce-
lerating this general intercourse. The people
around the Baltic, hitherto dreaded and abhorred
by the reft of Europe as pirates and invaders,
assumed more pacific manners, and began now
to visit their neighbours as merchants. Oc-
currences foreign from the subjet of the pre-
sent inquiry, united them together in the
powerful commercial confederacy so famous in
the middle ages, under the name of the Han-
featic League, and led them to eftablilh the
taple of their trade with the southern parts of
Europe in Bruges. Thither the merchants
of Italy, particularly those of Venice, resorted;
and in return for the produtions of the East,
and the manufacures of their own country,
they received not only the naval stores and
other commodities of the North, but a con-
fiderable supply of gold and silver from the
mines in various provinces of Germany, the

molf

most valuable and producive of any known at s EC T.
that time in Europe P. Bruges continued to be -
the great mart or storehouse of European trade
during the period to which my inquiries extend.
A regular communication, formerly unknown,
was kept up there among ail the kingdoms into
which our continent is divided, and we are
enabled to account for the rapid progress of
the Italian states in wealth and power, by ob-
serving how much their trade, the source from
which both were derived, must have augmented
upon the vast increase in the consumption of
Asiatic goods, when all the extensive countries
towards the north-east of Europe were opened
for their reception,

DURING this prosperous and improving state

of Indian commerce, Venice received from one
of its citizens, such new information concern-
ing the countries which produced the precious
commodities that formed the most valuable
article of its trade, as gave an idea of their
opulence, their population, and their extent,
which rose far above all the former conceptions
of Europeans. From the time that the Ma-

But about the middle of the thirteenth century,

a Venetian of a noble family, after trading for
some time in many of the opulent cities of

court of the Great Khan on the frontier of
China. During the course of twenty-fix years,

the Great Khan entrusted him, he explored
many regions of the East which no European

He visited different parts of Indoftan, and is
the first who mentions Bengal and Guzzerat,

information concerning an island which he
calls Zipangri or Cipango, probably Japan.
He visited in person Java, Sumatra, and several
ifands contiguous to them, the island of Ceylon,
and the coast of Malabar as far as the Gulf
of Cambay, to all which he gives the names
that they now bear. This was the most ex-

the most complete description of it ever given

hardly any knowledge of those regions but

and the eflablilhing the feat of the Turkish
government in Conftantinopie. The imme-
diate effect of this great revolution was, that
the Genoeii: residing in Pera, involved in the
general calamity, were obliged not only to
abandon that fettlemenr, but all those which
they had made on the adjacent fca-coaft, after
they had leen in their pofreflion near two cen-
turies. Not long after, the viEtorious arms of
D. . the Sultan expelled them from Caffa, and

every other place vhich they held in the Cri-
mea'. Conrrantinople was no longer a mart
open to the nations of the Weft for Indian com-
modities, and no supply of them could now
bc cbtai:edc but in Egypt and the ports of
Syri:, ft;!ect to the Soldans of the Mameluks.

retion and privileges which they had secured s E C T-
by their commercial treaty with those powerful L_
princes, carried on trade in every part of their
dominions with such advantage, as gave them
a superiority over every competitor. Genoa,
which had long been their most formidable
rival, humbled by the loss of its poffefions in
the East, and weakened by domestic dissensions,
declined so fast, that it was obliged to court
foreign protetion, and fubmittted alternately
to the dominion of the Dukes of Milan and
the Kings of France. In consequence of this
diminution of their political power, the com-
mercial exertions of the Genoese became less
vigorous. A feeble attempt which they made
to recover that Ihare of the Indian trade which
they had formerly enjoyed, by offering to enter
into treaty with the Soldans of Egypt upon
terms similar to those which had been granted
to the Venetians, proved unsuccessful; and
during the remainder of the fifteenth century,
Venice supplied the greater part of Europe with
the producions of the East, and carried on
trade to an extent far beyond what had been
known in those times.

THE slate of the other European nations
was extremely favourable to the commercial

progress

S EjC T. progress of the Venetians. England, desolated
'-v-' by the civil wars which the unhappy contest

between the houses of York and Lancaster
excited, had hardly begun to turn its attention
towards those objects and pursuits to which it is
indebted for its present opulence and power.
In France, the fatal effe&s of the English arms
and conquests were till felt, and the king had
neither acquired power, nor the people inclipna
tion, to direct the national genius and activity
to the arts of peace. The union of the dif-
ferent kingdoms of Spain was not yet com-
pleted; tome of its most fertile provinces
were still under the dominion of the Moors,
with whom the Spaniih monarchs waged per-
petual war; and, except by the Catalans, little
attention was paid to foreign trade. Portugal,
though it had already entered upon that career
ofdifcovery which terminated with most splendid
success, had not yet made such progress in it
as to be entitled to any high rank among
the commercial states of Europe. Thus the
Venetians, almost without rival or competitor,
except from some of the inferior Italian states, were
left at liberty to concert and to execute their
mercantile plans; and their trade with the
cities of the Hanseatic League, which united the
North and South of Europe, and which hitherto

had

p

had been common to all the Italians, was now s E C r.
cngroffed, in a great measure, by them alone. <-r

WHILE the increasing damand for the pro-

duEtions of Asia induced all the people of Eu-
rope t6 court intercourse with the Venetians
so eagerly, as to allure them, by various im-
munities, to frequent their sea-ports, we may
observe a peculiarity in their mode of carrying
on trade with the East, which diftinguilhes
it from what has taken place in other coun-
tries in any period of history. In the ancient
world, the Tyrians, the Greeks who were maf-
ters of Egypt, and the Romans, failed to India
in quest of those commodities with which they
fupplied'the people of the Weft. In modern
times, the fame has been the practice of the
Portuguese, the Dutch, the Englilh, and, after
their example, of other European nations.
In both periods loud complaints have been
made, that in carrying on this trade every state
must be drained of the precious metals, which,
in the course of it flow incessantly from the
Weft to the East, never to return. From
whatever loss might have been occasioned
by this gradual but unavoidable diminution
of their gold and silver (whether a real
or only an imaginary loss, it is not incum-
bent upon me in this place to inquire or to
determine), the Venetians were, in a great

4 meature,

S E C T. measure, exempted. They had no dire&t in-
,.- -- tercourfe .with India. I'hey found in Egypt,

or in Syria, warehoules filled with all the corn-
modi:ies of the East, imported by the Ma-
homedans; and from the best accounts we
havc, with rclpec't to the nature of their trade,
tlty purchafud them more frequently by barter,
than with ready money. Egypt, the chief mart
for Indian goods, though a most fertile coun-
try, is deflitute of many things requisite in an
inproved slate of society, either for accom-
mrndation er for ornament. Too limited in
extent, and too highly cultivated to afford space
for forests; too level to have mines of the useful
metals; it must be supplied with timber for
building, with iron, lead, tin, and brass, by im-
portation from other countries. The Egyptians,
while un.er the dominion of the Maineluks,
seem ncr themselves to have traded in the ports
of any Chriltian state, and it was principally
from the Venetians, that they received all the
articles which I have enumerated. Betides these,
the ingenuity the Venetian artists furnished a va-
riety of manufacures of woollen cloths, silk fluffs
of various fabric, ca-nb!cts, mirrors, arms, orna-
ments of gold and silver, glass, and many other
articles, for all which they found a ready market
in Egypt and Syria. In return they received
from the merchants of Alexandria, spices of
every kind, drugs, gems, pearls, ivory, cotton

and

and silk, unwtought as well as manufactured, s EC T.
in many different forms, and other produtions '-a,
of the East, together with several valuable
articles of Egyptian growth or fabric. In
Aleppo, Baruth, and other cities, besides the
proper commodities of India brought thither
by land, they added to their cargoes the carpets
of Persia, the rich wrought silks of Damascus,
still known by a name taken from that city,
and various productions of art and nature pe-
culiar to Syria, Palestine, and Arabia. If, at
any time, their demand for the produtions
of the East went beyond what they could pro-.
cure in exchange for their own manufatures,
that trade with the cities of the Hanseatic League,
which I have mentioned, furnished them from
the mines of Germany, with a regular supply
of gold and silver, which they could carry, with
advantage, to the markets of Egypt and Syria.

FROM a propensity, remarkable in all com-

mercial states, to subject the operations of trade
to political regulation and restraint, the autho-
rity of the Venetian government fcems to have
been interposed, both in direcling the import-
ation of Asiatic goods, and in the mode of cir-
culating them among the difterent nations of
Europe. To every conidlerable staple in the
Mediterranean a certain number of large vessels,

:.i known,

s C T. known by the name of Galeons or Caracks, was

- fitted out on the public account, and returned

loaded with the richest merchandise ", the
profit arising from the sale of which muff have
been no fender addition to the revenue of the
republic. Citizens, however, of every class,
particularly persons of noble families, were en-
couraged to engage in foreign trade, and who-
ever employed a veflfl of a certain burden for
this purpose, received a considerable bounty
from the state . It was in the fame manner,
partly in ships belonging to the public, and
partly in those of private traders, that the Ve-
retians circulated through Europe the goods
imported from the East, as well as the produce
of their own dominions and manufacures.

THERE are two different ways by which we

may come at some knowledge of the mag-
nitude of those branches of commerce carried
on by the Venetians. The one, by attending
to the great variety and high value of the com-
modities which they imported into Bruges, the
store-house from which the more northern nations
of Europe were supplied. A full enumeration

deemed, in that age, essential to accommodation
or to elegance . The other, by confidering
the effe&ts of the Venetian trade upon the cities
admitted to a participation of its advantages.
Never did wealth appear more conspicuously
in the train of commerce. The citizens of
Bruges, enriched by it, displayed in their dress,
their buildings, and mode of living, such magni-
ficence as even to mortify the pride and excite
the envy of royaltyz. Antwerp, when the
ifaple was removed thither, soon rivalled Bruges
in opulence and splendour. In some cities of
Germany, particularly in Augsburg, the great
mart for Indian commodities in the interior
parts of that extensive country, we meet with
early examples of such large fortunes accumu-
lated by mercantile industry, as raised the pro-
prietors of them to high rank and consideration
in the empire.

FROM observing this remarkable increase of

Opulence in all the places where the Vene-
tians had an established trade, we are led to
conclude, that the profit accruing to themselves

M X from

s EI T. from the different branches of it, especially that

p- with the East, muff have been still more con-

fiderable. It is impoflible, however, without
information much more minute than that to
which we have access, to form an estimate of
this with accuracy; but various circumstances
may be produced to establish, in general, the
justness of this conclusion. From the first re-
vival of a commercial spirit in Europe, the
Venetians poffefled a large share of the trade
with the East. It continued gradually to in-
crease, and during a great part of the fifteenth
century, they had nearly a monopoly of it.
This was. produ&cive of consequences attending
all monopolies. Wherever there is no compe-
tition, and the merchant has it in his power
to regulate the market, and to fix the price of
the commodities which he vends, his gains
will be exorbitant. Some idea of their mag-
nitude, during several centuries, may be formed,
by attending to the rate of the premium or
interest then paid for the use of money. This
is undoubtedly the most exact standard by which
to measure the profit arising from the capital
flock employed in commerce; for, according
as the interest of money is high or low, the
gain acquired by the use of i: mult vary, and
become'exceflive or moderate. From the clooe
of lt:e elevench century to the commencement

7 of

of the sixteenth, the period during which the s E C T.
Italians made their chief commercial exertions, v
the rate of interest was extremely high. It
was ufilally twenty per cent. Sometimes above
that; and so late as the year one thousand five
hundred, it had not funk below ten or twelve
per cent. in any part of Europe a. If the profits
of a trade so extensive as that of the Venetians
corresponded to this high value of money, it
could not fail of proving a source of great
wealth, both public and privateb. The con-
dition of Venice, accordingly, during the period
under review, is described by writers of that
age, in terms which are not applicable to that
of any other country in Europe. The revenues
of the republic, as well as the wealth amafled by
individuals, exceeded whatever was elsewhere
known. In the magnificence of their houses,
in richness of furniture, in profusion of plate,
and in every thing which contributed either
towards elegance or parade in their mode of
living, the nobles of Venice surpassed the state
of the greatest monarchs beyond the Alps. Nor
was all this display the effec of an ostentatious
and inconsiderate dissipation, it was the natural
consequence offuccefsful industry, which, having

S E C T. accumulated wealth with cafe, is entitled to enjoy
*- , · it in splendour'.

NEVER did the Venetians believe the power

of their country to be more firmly eftablithed,
or rely with greater confidence on the con-
tinuance and increase of its opulence, than to-
wards the close of the fifteenth century, whea
two events (which they could neither foresee
nor prevent) happened, that proved fatal to
both. The one was the discovery of America.
The other was the opening a direc course of
navigation to the East Indies, by the Cape
of Good Hope. Of all occurrences in the
history of the human race, these are undoubtedly
among the most interesting; and as they oc-
cafioned a remarkable change of intercourse
among the different quarters of the globe, and
finally eftablithed those commercial ideas and
arrangements which conltitute the chief dif-
tinacton between the manners and policy of
ancient and of modern times, an account of
them is intimately conneced with the subject
of this Disquisition, and will bring it to that
period which I have fixed upon for its boundary.
But as I have related the rife and progress of
these discoveries at great length in another

' Se: NOTE LI.

work,

workd, a rapid view of them is all that is re- s c T.
quifite in this place, ,

THE admiration or envy with which the othet

nations of Europe beheld the power and wealth
of Venice, led them naturally to enquire into
the causes of this pre-eminence; and among
these, its lucrative commerce with the East
appeared to be by far the most considerable.
Mortified with being excluded from a source of
opulence, which to the Venetians had proved
so abundant, different countries had attempted
to acquire a share of the Indian trade. Some
of the Italian states endeavoured to obtain ad-
mission into the ports of Egypt and Syria, upon
the fame terms with the Venetians; but either
by the superior interest of the Venetians in the
court of the Soldans, their negociations for that
purpose were rendered unsuccessful; or from the
manifold advantages which merchants, long in
poffefion of any branch of trade, have in a com-
petition with new adventurers, all their exertions
did not produce effets of any confequencec.
In other countries, various schemes were formed
with the fame view. As early as the year one
thousand four hundred and eighty, the inventive
and enterprising genius of Columbus conceived

:M 4 the

S E C T. the idea of opening a shorter and more certain
----, communication with India, by holding a direct

westerly course towards those regions, which,
according to Marco Polo and other travellers,
extended eastward far beyond the utmost limits
of Asia known to the Greeks or Romans.
This scheme, supported by arguments deduced
from a scientific acquaintance with cosmography,
from his own practical knowledge of navigation,
from the reports of skilful pilots, and from the
theories and conjecures of the ancients, he
proposed first to the Genoese his countrymen,
and next to the king of Portugal, into whose
service he had entered. It was rejeted by
the former from ignorance, and by the latter
with circumstances most humiliating to a ge-
nerous mind. By perseverance, however, and
address, he at length induced the most wary
and least adventurous court in Europe to un-
dertake the execution of his plan; and Spain,
as t.e reward of this deviation from its usual cau-
tious maxims, had the glory of discovering a new
world, hardly inferior in magnitude to a third
part of the habitable globe. Astonishing as
the success of Columbus was, it did not fully
accomplilh his own willes, or conduct him
to tholc regions of the East, the expectation
of reaching which was the original object of
L:iz voyage. The effects, however, of his dif-

coveries

coveries were great and extensive. By giving s E c T-
Spain the possession of immense territories, _-
abounding in rich mines, and many valuable pro-
ducions of nature, several of which had hitherto
been deemed peculiar to India, wealth began
to flow so copiously into that kingdom, and
thence was so diffused over Europe, as gra-
dually awakened a general spirit of industry,
and called forth exertions, which alone must
have soon turned the course of commerce into
new channels.

BUT this was accomplished more speedily,

as well as more completely, by the other great
event which I mentioned, the discovery of a
new route of navigation to the East by the
Cape of Good Hope. When the Portuguese, to
whom mankind are indebted for opening this
communication between the most remote parts
of the habitable globe, undertook their first
voyage of discovery, it is probable that they had
nothing farther in view than to explore those
parts of the coast of Africa which lay nearest to
their own country. But a spirit of enterprise,
when roused and put in motion, is always pro-
greffive; and that of the Portuguese, though
flow and timid in its first operations, gradually
acquired vigour, and prompted them to ad-
vance along the wcitern shore of the African

continent,

S E C T. continent, far beyond the utmost boundary of

,- . ancient navigation in that diretion. Encou-

raged by success, this spirit became more ad-
venturous, despised dangers which formerly
appalled it, and surmounted difficulties which
it once deemed insuperable. When the Por-
tuguefe found in the torrid zone, which the
ancients had pronounced to be uninhabitable,
fertile countries, occupied by numerous nations;
and perceived that the continent of Africa,
instead of extending in breadth towards the
Weft, according to the opinion of Ptolemy,
appeared to contract itself, and to bend Eat-
wards, more extensive prospects opened to
their view, and inspired them with hopes of
reaching India, by continuing to hold the fame
course which they had so long pursued.

AFTER several unsuccessful attempts to ac-

complifh what they had in view, a finall fquadion
failed from the Tagus, under the command of
Vasco de Gama, an officer of rank, whose
abilities and courage fitted him to conduc the
most difficult and arduous enterprises. From
unacquaintance, however, with the proper season
and route of navigation in that vast ocean through
which he had to s.eer his course, his voyage
was long and dangerous. At length he doubled
that promontory, which, for several years, had

been

been the obje& of terror and of hope to his s Ez T.
countrymen. From that, after a prosperous -
navigation along the south-east of Africa, he
arrived at the city of Melinda, and had the
fatisfaaion of discovering there, as well as at
other places where he touched, people of a
race very different from the rude inhabitants
of the Western shore of that continent, which
alone the Portuguese had hitherto visited.
These he found to be so far advanced in civili-
zation, and acquaintance with the various arts
of life, that they carried on an ative commerce,
not only with the nations on their own coast,
but with remote countries of Asia. Conducted
by their pilots, who held a course (with which
experience had rendered them well acquainted)
he failed across the Indian ocean, and landed
at Calecut, on the coast of Malabar, on the
twenty-fecond of May, one thousand four hun-
dred and ninety-eight, ten months and two days
after his departure from the port of Lilbon.

THE Samorin, or Monarch of the country,

astonished at this unexpected visit of an un-
known people, whose aspect, and arms, and
manners, bore no resemblance to any of the
nations accustomed to frequent his harbours,
and who arrived in his dominions by a route

hitherto

s E c T. hitherto deemed impra&cicable, received them,
a-_-- at firfr, with that fond admiration which is

often excited by novelty. But in a short time,
as if he lhad been inspired with foresight of
all the calamities now approaching India by
this fatal communication opened with the in-
habitants of Europe, he formed various
schemes to cut off Gama and his follow-
ers. But from evenr danger to which he
was exposed, cither by the open attacks or
secret machination of the Indians, the Portu-
guefe Admiral extricated himfeif with singular
prudence and intrepidity, and at last failed from
Calecut with his /hips loaded, not only with
the commodities peculiar to that coals, but with
many of the rich productions of the Eastern
parts of India.

ON his return to Lisbon, he was received

with the admiration and gratitude due to a man
who, by his superior abilities and resolution,
had conducted to such an happy ilTiue an under-
taking of the greatest importance, which had
long occupied the thoughts of his Sovereign,
and excited the hopes of his fellow-fubjecs'.

Nor

Nor did this event interest the Portuguese alone. s El T.
No nation in Europe beheld it with unconcern. ,r
For although the discovery of a new world,
whether we view it as a display of genius in
the person who first conceived an idea of that
undertaking which led mankind to the know-
ledge of it, whether we contemplate its in-
fluence upon science by giving a more com-
plete knowledge of the globe which we inhabit,
or whether we confider its effets upon the
commercial intercourse of mankind, be an event
fir more splendid than the voyage of Gama,
yet the latter seems originally to have excited
more general attention. The former, indeed,
filled the minds of men with astonishment;
it was some time, however, before they attained
such a iufficient knowledge of that portion of
the earth now laid open to their view, as to
form any just idea, or even probable conjecure,
with respect to what might be the consequences
of communication with it. But the i!nmenfe
value of the Indian trade, which both in ancient
and in modern times had enriched every nation
by which it was carried on, was a fubjct fa-
miliar to the thoughts of all intelligent men,
and they'at once perceived that the discovery
of this new route of navigation to the East,
must occasion great revolutions, not only in
the courle of commerce, but in the political
Itate of Europe.

WHAT

S E C T. WHAT thef revolutions were mos likely

, _-I. to be, and how they would operate, were points

examined with particular attention in the cities
of Lisbon and of Venice, but with feelings
very different. The Portuguese, founding upon
the rights to which, in that age, priority of dif-
covery, confirmed by a papal grant, were sup-
posed to confer, deeming themselves intitled to
an exclusive commerce with the countries which
they had first virited, began to enjoy, by an-
ticipation, all the benefits of it, and to fancy
that their capital would soon be what Venice
then was, the great Rfore-houfe of Eastern com-
modities to all Europe, and the'feat of opulence
and power. On the first intelligence of Gama's
successful voyage, the Venetians, with the quick-
fighted discernment of merchants, foresaw the
immediate consequence of it to be the ruin of
that lucrative branch of commerce which had
contributed so greatly to enrich and aggrandize
their country; and they observed this with more
poignant concern, as they were apprehensive
that they did not possess any effetual means
of preventing, or even retarding, its operation.

THE hopes and fears of both were well

founded. The Portuguese entered upon the
new career opened to them with activity and
ardour, and made exertions, both commercial
and military, far beyond what could have been

6 expected

expeted from a kingdom of 'uch inconsiderable s E c T.
extent. All these were dire&ed by an intelligent - J
monarch, capable of forming plans of the
greatest magnitude with calm fyftcmatic wis-
dom, and of prosecuting them with unremitting
perseverance. The prudence and vigour of
his measures, however, would have availed little
without proper instruments to carry them into
execution. Happily for Portugal, the discerning
eye of Emanuel fele&ed a succession of officers
to take the supreme command in India, who,
by their enterprizing valour, military {kill, and
political sagacity, accompanied with disinterested
integrity, public spirit, and love of their count
try, have a title to be ranked with the persons
molt eminent for virtue and abilities in any
age or nation. Greater things perhaps were
atchieved by them, than were ever accomplished
in so short a time. Before the close of Emanuel's
reign, twenty-four years only after the voyage
of Gama, the Portuguese had rendered them-
selves masters of the city of Malacca, in which
the great staple of trade carried on among the
inhabitants of all those regions in Ala, which
Europeans have diltinguifhed by the general
name of the Eaft-Indies, was then established.
To this port, situated nearly at an equal distance
from the Ealltern and Western extremities of
these countries, and poffelilng the command

of

S E C T. of that strait, by which they keep communi-

-_- cation with each other, the merchants of China,

of Japan, of every kingdom on the continent,
of the Moluccas and all the islands in the Ar-
chipelago, retorted from the East; and those
of Malabar, of Ceylon, of Coromandel, and
of Bengal, from the Weft . This conquest
secured to the Portuguese great influence over
the interior commerce of India, while, at the
fame time, by their settlements at Goa and Diu,
they were enabled to engross the trade of the
Malabar coast, and to obftrud greatly the long
eftabliihed intercourse of Egypt with India by
the Red Sea. Their ships frequented every
port in the East where valuable commodities
were to be found, from the Cape of Good
Ilope to the river of Canton; and along this
immense firetch of coast, extending upwards
of four thousand leagues h, they had eftablithed,
for the conveniency or protection of trade, a
chain of forts cr factories. They had likewise
taken possession of stations most favourable to
commerce along the Southern coast of Africa,
and in many of the islands which lie between
Madagascar and the Moluccas. In every part

of

of the East they were received with refpet, S E C T.
in many they had acquired the absolute com- _
mand. They carried on trade there without
rival or controul; they prescribed to the natives
the terms of their mutual intercourse; they often
set what price they pleased on goods which
they purchased; and were thus enabled to im-
port from Indoftan and the regions beyond it,
whatever is useful, rare, or agreeable, in greater
abundance, and of more various kinds, than
had been known formerly in Europe.

NOT satisfied with this ascendant which they

had acquired in India, the Portuguese early
formed a scheme, no less bold than interested,
of excluding all other nations from participating
of the advantages of commerce with the East.
In order to efict this, it was necefalry to obtain
poffefllon of such fiations in the Arabian and
Persian Gulfs, as might render them masters
of the navigation of there two inland seas, and
enable them both to obftruEt the ancient cem-
mercial intercourse between Egypt and India,
and to command the entrance of the .great
rivers, which facilitated the conveyance of Indian
goods, not only through the interior provinces
of Asia, but as far as Constantinople. The
conduct of the measures for this purpose was
committed to Alphonfo Albuquerque, the most

N eminent

S E C T. eminent of all the Portuguese generals who dif-
t .- i tinguifhed themfclves in India. After the

utmost efforts of genius and valour, he was
able to accomplilh one-half only of what the
ambition of his countrymen had planned. By
wrefling the island of Grmuz, which commanded
the mouth of the Persian Gulf, from the petty
princes, who, as tributaries to the monarchs of
Persia, had eftablilhed their dominion there,
he secured to Portugal that extensive trade
with the East, which the Persians had carried on
for several centuries. In the hands of the Por-
tuguefe, Ormuz soon became the great mart
from which the Persian empire, and all the
provinces of Asia to the weft of it, were supplied
with the productions of India; and a city which
they built on that barren island, destitute of
water, was rendered one of the chief feats of
opulence, 1plendour, and luxury in the Eastern
world .

THE operations ofAlbuquerque in the Red Sea

Hxere far from being attended with equal success.

princes, wholC ports he attacked, and partly
by the damage his fleet sustained in a sea of

: whlich

which the navigation is remarkably difficult s E C T.
and dangerous, he was constrained to retire, --.
without effe&ing any ettlement of importance k.
The ancient channel of inteicourfe with India by
the Red Sea still continued open to the Egyptians
but their commercial tranfaaions in that coun-
try were greatly circumscribed and obftruted,
by the influence which the Portuguese had ac-
quired in every port to which they were accuf-
tomed to resort.

IN consequence of this, the Venetians soon

began to feel that decrease of their own Indian
trade which they had foreseen and dreaded.
In order to prevent the farther progress of this
evil, they persuaded the Soldan of the Mame-
luks, equally alarmed with themselves a. the
rapid success of the Portuguese in the East,
and no less interested to hinder them from
engrossing that commerce, which had so long
been the chief source of opulence both to the
monarchs and to the people of Egypt, to enter
into a negociation with the Pope and the King
of Portugal. The tone which the Soldan as-
fumed in this negociation was such as became
the fierce chief of a military governm¢ ::t.

_ that if the Portu!guefc did not rclinquinf that

new courf of navigation by which they had
penetrated into the Indian ocean, and cease
from encroaching on that commerce, which
from time immemorial had been carried on
between the Ealt of Alia and his dominions,
he would put to dcath ail the christians in Egypt,
Syria, and Palestine, burn their churches, and
demolifli the holy fepilchre itself'. This for-
midable threat, which, during fevcral centuries,
would have made all Christendom tremble,
seems to have made so litttle impression, that
the Venetians, as the last expedient, had re-
course to a measure, which, in that age, was
deemed not only reprehensible but impious.
They incited the Sold.n to fit out a fleet in the
Red Sea, and to attack those unexpe&ed in-
vaders of a gainful monopoly, of which he and
his predecessors had long enjoyed undiffurbed
pofieflion. As Egypt did not produce timber
proper for building ships of force, the Vene-
tians permitted the Soldan to cut it in their

twelve s-ips of war were built, on board of s E c T.
which a body of Mameluks was ordered to ---
ftrve, under the command of an officer of merit.
These new enemies, far more formidable than
the natives of India with whom the Portu-
gucfe had hitherto contended, they encountered,
with undaunted courage, and after tome conflies,
they entirely ruined the squadron, and remained
malters of the Indian ocean".

SooN after this diiafter, the dominion of the
,itamciuks was overturned, and igypt, Syria,
and Paieftine were fubjeccd to the Turkilh
empire by the victcrious arms of Selim I. Their
mutual interest quickly induced the Turks and
Venetians to forget ancient animofities, and to
co-operate towards the ruin of the Portuguese
trade in India. With this view Sclim con-
frrmed to the Vcnetiians the extensive commer-
cial privileges which they had enjoyed under
the government of the Mameluks, and pub-
lifhed an edict permitting the free entry of all
the produCtions of the East, imported directly
from Alexandria, into every part of his do-
minions, and impoling heavy duties upon such
as were brought from Lilbon "

sessed in supplying Europe with the commodi-
ties of the East, in conlfquence of having
opened a new mode of communication with
it. At the fame time, the Vetetians, brought
to the brink of ruin by the fatal league of
Cambray, which broke the power and humbled
the pride of the republic, were incapable of
such efforts for the prefrrvation of their com-
merce, as they might have made in the more
vigorous age of their government, and were
reduced to the feeble expedients of a declining
state. Of this there is a remarkable instance
in an offer made by them to the King of Por-
tugal in the year one rhoufand five hundred
and tswenty-one, to purchafc, at a stipulated
price, all th:e spices imported into Lifhon, over

they

they established there a commercial empire; s E c T.
to which, whether we confider its extent, its _--
opulence, the flerder power by which it was
formed, or the splendour with which the go-
vernment of it was conducted, there had hi-
therto been nothing comparable in the history
of nations. Emanuel, who laid the foundation
of this stupendous fabric, had the fatisfation
to fee it almost completed. Every part of
Europe was supplied by the Portuguese with
the productions of the East; and if we except
some inconsiderable quantity of them, which
the Venetians still continued to receive by the
ancient channels of conveyance, our quarter
of the globe had no longer any commercial
intercourse with India, and the regions of Asia
beyond it, but by the Cape of Good Hope.

THOUGH from this period the people of

Europe have continued to carry on their trade
with India by sea, yet a considerable portion
of the valuable productions of the East is still
conveyed to other regions of the earth by land-
carriage. In tracing the progress of trade with
India, this branch of it is an object of con-
fiderable magnitude, which has not been ex-
amined with sufficient attention. That the
ancients should have had recourse frequently
to the tedious and expensive mode oftranfporting

N 4 goods

S E c T. g3ods by land, will not appear surprising,
-y-, 1 when we recolle&t the imperrfect tate of na-

vigation among them: The reason of this mode
of conveyance being not only continued, but
increased, in modern times, demands some ex-
planation.

IF we infpe& a map of Asia, we cannot fail

to obfcrve, that the communication throughout
all the countries of that great continent to the
weft of Indoftan and China, though opened in
some degree towards the south by the naviga-
ble rivers, Euphrates and Tigris, and towards
the north by two inland seas, the Euxine and
Caspian, must be carried on in many extensive
provinces wholly by land. This, as I have
observed, was the first mode of intercourse
between different countries, and during the
infancy of navigation it was the only one. Even
after that art had attained some degrce of im-
provement, the conveyance of goods by the
two rivers formerly me;ntioned, extended so
little way into the interior countlry, and the
trade of the Luxine a;;d CaipLin ieas were so
often obftruaed by trc 'b:rb.;rous nations scat-
tered along tli'ir Iho; :, tat partly on that
accCunt, and t.ait;y irni-m the adherence of man-
kind to ancient habits, t:e co:nir.irce of' the
various provinces ot ACia, particularly that with

India

India and the regions beyond it, continued to S E C T.
be conduted by land.

THE fame circumstances which induced the

inhabitants of Asia to carry on such a con-
fidcrable part of their commerce with each other
in this manner, operated with fill more power-
ful etcd in Africa. That vast continent, which
littl resembles the other divisions of the earth,
is not penetrated by inland seas, like Europe
and Asia, or by a chain of lakes, like North
America, or opened by rivers (the Nile alone
excepted) of extended navigation. It forms
one tuiform, continuous fur'ace, between the
various parts of which there could be no inter-
cou; iv firm the earliest times, but by land. Rude
as all the people of Africa are, and flinder as
the pru-rels is which they have made in the
arts ot liil, such a communication appears to
have been eaily opened and always kept up.
How far it extended in the more early periods
to which my researches have been directed, and
by what different routes it was carried on, I
have not sufficient information to determine
with accuracy. It is highly probable that, from
time immemorial, the gold, the ivory, the per-
fumes, both of the southern parts of Africa,
and of its more northern diftrits, were con-
veyed either to the Arabian Gulf, or to Egypt,

and

s E c T. and exchanged for the spices and other produc-

t .
, _tions of the East.

THE Mahomedan religion, which spread with

amazing rapidity over all Asia and a considerable
part of Africa, contributed greatly towards the
increase of commercial intercourse by land in
both these quarters of the globe, and has given
it additional vigour, by mingling with it a new
principle of activity, and by directing it to
a common centre. Mahomet enjoined all his
followers to visit once in their life-time, the
Caaba, or square building in the temple of Mecca,
the immemorial object of veneration among his
countrymen, not only on account of its having
been chosen (according to their tradition) to be
the residence of man at his creation P, but be-
cause it was the first spot on this earth which
was consecrated to the worship of God :
In order to preserve continually upon their
minds a fence of obligation to perform this duty,
he directed that, in all the multiplied afts of
devotion which his religion prescribes, true
believers lhould always turn their faces towards

that

that holy place'. In obedience to a precept S E c T.
solemnly enjoined and sedulously inculcated, ' -
large caravans of pilgrims assemble annually
in every country where the Mahomedan faith
is eftabliflied. From the liores of the Atlantic
on one hand, and from the molt remote regions
of the East on the other, the votaries of the
Prophet advance to Mecca. Commercial ideas
and objects mingle with those of devotion.
The numerous camels' of each caravan are
loaded with those commodities of every coun-
try which are of easiest carriage and most ready
file. The holy city is crowded, not only with
zealous devotees, but with opulent merchants.
During the few days they remain there,
the fair of Mecca is the greatest, perhaps, on
the face of the earth. Mercantile tranfa&ions
are carried on in it to an immense value, of
which the dispatch, the silence, the mutual
confidence and good faith in conducting them,
are the most unequivocal proof. The pro-
ductions and manufactures of India form a ca-
pital article in this great traffic, and the caravans,
on their return, dill-liinate them through every
part of Asia and Africa. Some of these are
deemed nectifary, not only to the comfort,

S EC T. THr-s I have en'cavoured to describe the

and by land, from t.e carlieft times in which
history affords any autlienti information con-
cerning it, until an entire :cvolution was made
i!n its nature, and the i;odce of carrying it on,
)by that -reat dilcovery vhich I originally fixed
a- the utmiii' boundary of nm enquiries. Here,
then, this I)ii;lufition might have been termi-

duced into Europe, in consequence of the value S ElC T.
and importance of commerce being so thoroughly -_-
understood, that in almost every country the
encouragement of it became a chief obje& of
public attention; as we have now reached that
point whence a line may be drawn which marks
the chief diftinEtion between the manners and
political institutions of ancient and modern
times, it will render the work more inftru&ive
and useful, to conclude it with some general
observations, which naturally arise from a fur-
vey of both, and a comparison of the one with
the other. These observations, I trust, will be
found not only to have an intimate conne&ion
with the subjec of my researches, and to throw
additional light upon it; but will serve to
illustrate many particulars in the general history
of commerce, and to point out effEts or con-
sequences of various events, which have not
been generally observed, or confidered with
that attention which they merited.

I. AFTER viewing the great and extensive

effeCts of finding a new course of navigation
to India by the Cape of Good Hope, it may
appear surprising to a modern obfcrvcr, that
a discovery of such importance was not made, or
even attempted, by any of the commercial states
of the ancient world. But in judging -i:'

refpe:

s E C T. respect to the conduct of nations in remote times,

-y. we never err more widely, than when we decide

with regard to it, not according to the ideas
and views of their age, but of our own. This
is not, perhaps, more conspicuous in an) in-
stance, than in that under consideration. It was
by the Tyrians, and by the Greeks, who were
masters of Egypt, that the different people of
Europe were first supplied with the produEtions
of the East. From the account that has been
given of the manner in which they procured
there, it is manifest that they had neither the
fame inducements with modern nations, to wiih
for any new communication with India, nor
the fame means of accomplishing it. All the
commercial transactions of the ancients with
the Eaf were confined to the ports on the Ma-
labar coast, or extended at farthest to the island
of Ceylon. To rhefe staples, the natives of
all the different regions in the eastern parts of
Alia brotught she cnmmrrdiics which were the
gro'.:h of :hcir .-v;vra ccut:ries, or the pro-
dt:ut of their ingenuity, in their own veffcls, and
with them the fl.ips from Tyre and from
Egypt completed tleir invcit-ments. While the
operations of their Indian trade were carried
on wijhin a sphere so circurfcribcd, the cons
veyance of a cargo by the Arabian Gulf, not-

v.ith: ineg :;:- :-e:;ice of land carriage, either

from

from Elath to Rhinocolura, or across the defart s E e T.
to the Nile, was so fare and commodious, -v-_
that the merchants of Tyre and Alexandria
had little reason to be solicitous for the dif-
covery of any other. The situation of both
these cities, as well as that of the other con-
fiderable commercial ifates of antiquity, was
very different from that of the countries to
which, in later times, mankind have been in-
debted for keeping up intercourse with the
remote parts of the globe. Portugal, Spain,
England, Holland, which have been molf acive
and successful in this line of enterprise, all lie
on the Atlantic ocean, (in which every Eu-
ropean voyage of discovery must commence,)
or have immediate access to it. But Tyre was
situated at the eastern extremity of the Me-
diterranean, Alexandria not far from it; Rhodes,
Athens, Corinth, which came afterwards to be
ranked among the most adtive trading cities of
antiquity lay considerably advanced towards
the fame quarter in that tea. The commerce
of all these states was long confined within
the precints of the Mediterranean; and in
some of them never extended beyond it. The
pillars of Hercules, or the Straits of Gibraltar,
were long confidered as the utmost boundary
of navigation. To reach this was deemed a
signal proof of naval skill; and before any of

o there

S E C T. these states could give a beginning to an at-

*-, _ tempt towards exploring the vast unknown ocean

which lay beyond it, they had to accomplish
a voyage (according to their ideas) of great
extent and much danger. This was sufficient
to deter them from engaging in an arduous
undertaking, from which, even if attended with
fucces, their situation prevented their enter-
taining hopes of deriving great advantage '

BUT could we suppose the discovery of a

new passage to India to have become an obje&t
of desire or pursuit to any of these states, their
science as well as practice of navigation was
so defective, that it would have been hardly
possible for them to attain it. The vessels
which the ancients employed in trade were so
fiall, as not to afford stowage for provisions
sufficient to subsist a crew during a long
voyage. Their construction was such that
they could seldom venture to depart far
from land, and their mode of lteering along
the coast (which I have been obliged to
mention often) so circuitous and flow, that
from these as well as from other circumstances
which I might have specified', we may pro-

nounce

nounce a voyage from the Mediterranean to s E c T.
India by the Cape of Good Hope, to have v
been an undertaking beyond their power to
accomplih, in such a manner as to render it,
in any degree, fubfcrvient to commerce. To
this decision, the account preserved by Herodo-
tus, of a voyage performed by some Phenician
ihips employed by a king of Egypt, which, taking
their departure from the Arabian Gulf, doubled
the southern promontory of Africa, and arrived
at the end of three years, by the Straits of
Gades, or Gibraltar, at the mouth of the Nile',
can hardly be confidered as repugnant; for
several writers of the greatest eminence among
the ancients, and most diftinguified for their
proficiency in the knowledge of geography,
regarded this account rather as an amusing
tale, than the history of a real tranfation; and
either entertained doubts concerning the pof-
fibility of failing round Africa, or absolutely
denied it d. But if what Herodotus relates
concerning the course held by there Phenician
hfips had ever been received by the ancients
with general assent, we can hardly suppose, that
any fiate could have been so wildly adventurous

s B c T. as to imagine that a voyage, which it required
_wm-' three years to complete, could be undertaken

with a profpet of commercial benefit.

II. THE rapid progress of the moders in

exploring India, as well as the extensive power
and valuable settlements which they early ac-
quired there, mark such a diftincion between
their mode of conducting naval operations,
and that of the ancients, as merits to be con-
fidcrtd and explained with attention. From
the reign of the first Ptolemy, to the conquest
of Egypt by the Mahomedans, Europe had
been supplied with the produ&ions of the East
by the Greeks of Alexandria, by the Romans
while they were masters of Egypt, and by the
fubjets of the Emperors ofConftantinople, when
that kingdom became a province of their do-
minions. During this long period, extending
ahnoft to a thousand years, none of those peo-
ple, the most enlightened, undoubtedly, in the
ancient world, ever advanced by sea farther
towards the East than the GulfofSiam, andhad
no regular eftablilhed trade but with the ports
on the coast of Malabar, or those in the illand
of Ceylon. They attempted no conquests in
any part of India, they made no settlements,
they ereaed no forts. Satisfied with an inter-
course merely commercial, they did not aim at

\~~~~~~~i ~acquiring

acquiring any degree of power or dominion in s E T.
the countries where they traded, though it '-_
seems to be probable that they might have
established it without much opposition from
the natives, a gentle effeminate people, with
whom, at that time, no foreign and more war-
like race was mingled. But the enterprising
ativity of the Portuguese was not long confined
within the fame limits; a few years after their
arrival at Calecut, they advanced towards the
East, into regions unknown to the ancients.
The kingdoms of Cambodia, Cochin China,
Tonquin, the vast empire of China, and all the
fertile ilands in the great Indian Archipelago,
from Sumatra to the Philippines, were dif-
covered, and the Portuguese, though opposed
in every quarter by the Mahomedans of Tartar
or Arabian origin fettled in many parts of
India, enemies much more formidable than the
natives, eftabliihed there that extensive influence
and dominion which I have formerly described.

OF this remarkable difference between the

progress and operations of the ancients and
moderns in India, the imperfect knowledge of
the former, with refpe& both to the theory
and pra&ice of navigation, seems to have been
the principal cause. From the coast of Malabar
to the Philippines, was a voyage of an extent

o 3 far

S E C T. fL beyond any that the ancients were accuf-
'.;- .. tomed to undertake, and, according to their

manner of failing, must have required a great
)lngth of time to perform it. The .nature of
their trade with India was such, that they had
not (as has been formerly observed) the fame
inducements with the moderns, to proiccute
discovery with ardour; and, according to the
d~cription given of the vessels in which the
merchants of Alexandria carried on their trade
from the Arabian Gulf, they appear to have
been very unfit for that purpose. On all there
accounts, the ancients remained satisfied with
a slender knowledge of India; and influenced
by reasons proceeding from the fame cause,
they attempted neither conquest nor fettle-
ment there. In order to accomplish either
of there, they must have transported a confi-
derable number of men into India. But, from
the defedtive structure of their Ihips, as well
as from the imperfeion of their art in navi-
gating them, the ancients seldom ventured to
convey a bo,,y of troops to any distance by sea.
From Berenice to Mufiris, was to them, even
after Hippalus had discovered the method of
steering a dire& course, and when their naval
skill had attained to its highest state of improve-
ment, a voyage of no less than seventy days.
By the ancient route along the coast of Persia,

a voyage

a voyage from the Arabian Gulf to any part s E c T
of India must have been of greater length, J

.-w

and accomplified more slowly. As no hostile
attack was ever made upon India by sea, either
by the Greek monarchs of Egypt, though the
two first of them were able and ambitious
Princes, or by the most enterprizing of the
Roman Emperors, it is evident that they must
have deemed it an attempt beyond their power
to execute. Alexander the Great, and in imita-
tion of him, his successors, the marnarehs es
Syria, were the only persons in the ancient
world who formed an idea of establishing their
dominion in any part of India; but it was with
armies led thither by land, that they hoped to
atchieve this.

III. THE sudden effe& of opening a direc&

communication with the East, in lowering the
price of Indian commodities, is a circumstance
that merits observation. How compendious
soever the ancient intercourse with India may
appear to have been, it was attended with con-
fiderable expence. The productions of the
remote parts of Asia, brought to Ceylon, or to
the ports on the Malabar coall, by the natives,
were put on board the ships which arrived
from the Arabian Gulf. At Berenice they
were landed, and carried by camels two hundred

o 4 and

s E C T. and fifty-eight miles to the banks of the Nile.

IV.
i- There they were again embarked, and conveyed

down the river to Alexandria, whence they were
dispatched to different markets. The addition
to the price of goods by such a multiplicity
of operations must have been considerable,
especially when the rate chargeable on each
operation was fixed by monopoliets, subjec to
no controul. But, after the palrage to India
by the Cape of Good Hope was discovered,
its various commodities were purchased at firRf
hand in the countries of which they were the
growth or manufacture. In all these, particu-
larly in Indoftan and in China, the subsistence
of man is more abundant than in any other part
of the earth. The people live chiefly upon
rice, the most prolific of all grains. Popula-
tion, of consequence, is so great, and labour
so extremely cheap, that every producion of
nature or of art is fold at a very low price.
When there were shipped in different parts
of India, they were conveyed direcly to Lisbon,
by a navigation, long indeed, but uninterrupted
and safe, and thence circulated through Europe.
The carriage of mercantile goods by water is
so much less expensive than by any other mode
of conveyance, that as soon as the Portuguese
could import the productions of India in sus-
ficicnt quantities to supply the demands of

Europe,

Europe, they were able to afford them at such s EC T.
a reduced price, that the competition of the -. .
Venetians ceased almost entirely, and the full
fiream of commerce flowed in its natural di-
reAion towards the cheapest market. In what
proportion the Portuguese lowered the price
of Indian commodities, I cannot ascertain with
precision, as I have not found in contemporary
writers sufficient information with refpe&t to
that point. Some idea, however, of this, ap-
proaching perhaps near to accuracy, may be
formed, from the computations of Mr. Munn,
an intelligent English merchant. He has pub-
liihed a table of the prices paid for various
articles of goods in India, compared with the
prices for which they were fold in Aleppo,
from which the difference appears to be nearly
as three to one; and he calculates, that, after a
reasonable allowance for the expence of the
voyage from India, the fame goods may be
fold in England at half the price which
they bear in Aleppo. The expence of con-
veying the productions of India up the
Persian Gulf to Baffora, and thence either
through the Great or Little Desert to
Aleppo, could not, I (hould imagine, differ
considerably from that by the Red Sea to
Alexandria. We may therefore suppose, that
the Venetians might purchase them from the

merchants

$S c T. merchants of that city, at nearly the fame rate

for which they were fold in Aleppo; and when
we add to this, what they must have charged at
their own profit in all the markets which they
frequented, it is evident that the Portuguese
might afford to reduce the commodities of the
East at a price below that which has been men-
tioned, and might supply every part of Europe
with them more than one-half cheaper than for-
merly. The enterprizing schemes of the Portu-
guei: monarchs were accomplified sooner, as
well as more completely, than in the hour of
most languine hope they could have presumed to
expe&t; and early in the sixteenth century, their
fubjcts became possesid of a monopoly of the
trade with India, founded upon the only equi-
table title, that of furnishing its productions
in greater abundance, and at a more moderate
price.

IV. We may observe, that in consequence of

a more plntiful supply of Indian goods, and at
a cheaper rate, the demand for them increased
rapidly in every part of Europe. To trace
the progress of this in detail, would lead me far
beyond the period which I have fixed as the
limit of this Disquisition, but some general re-
marks concerning it will be found intimately
conne&ed with the fubje& of my inquiries.

The

The chief articles of importation from India, s E C T.
while the Romans had the diret ion of the trade _-
with that country, have been formerly fpeci-
fled. But upon the subversion of their empire,
and the settlement of the fierce warriors of
Scyi-.ia and Germany in the various countries
of Europe, the state of society, as well as the
co,'iion of individuals, became so extremely
dif. rent, that the wants and desires of men were
no lorte. the fame. Barbarians, many of them
not far advanced in their progress beyond the
rudest itate of social life, had little relish for
those accommodations, and that elegance, which
are so alluring to polished nations. The cu-
rious manufacures of silk, the precious stones
and pearls of the East, which had been the
ornament and pride of the wealthy and luxurious
citizens of Rome, were not objecs of desire to
men, who, for a considerable time after they
took possession of their new conquests, retained
the original simplicity of their pastoral manners.
They advanced, however, from rudeness to re-
finement in the usual course of progreflion which
nations are destined to hold, and an increase of
wants and desires requiring new objets to gra-

some of the luxuries of India. Among these
they had a singular predilection for the fpiceries
and aromatics which that country yields in such

h-v- fondness for these arose, it is not of importance

to inquire. Whoever consults the writers of the
middle ages, will find many particulars which
confirm this observation. In every enumeration
of Indian commodities which they give, spices
arc always mentioned as the molt considerable
and precious article'. In their cookery, all
dishes were highly seasoned with them. In
every entertainment of parade, a profulion of
them was deemed effntial to magnificence. In
every medical prescription they were principal
ingredients f. But considerable as the demand
for spices had become, the mode in which the
nations of Europe had hitherto been supplied
with them was extremely disadvantageous. The
Ihips employed by the merchants of Alexandria
never ventured to visit those remote regions
which produce the most valuable spices, and
before they could be circulated through Europe,
they were loaded with the accumulated profits
received by four or five different hands through
which they had passed. But the Portuguese,
with a bolder spirit of navigation, having pene-
trated into every part of Asia, took in their

cargo of spices in the places where they grew, s E T.
and could afford to dispose of them at such a -
price, that, from being an expensive luxury,
they became an article of such general use, as
greatly augmented the demand for them. An
effe& similar to this may be observed, with
rcfpe& to the demand for other commodities
imported from India, upon the reduction of
their price by the Portuguese. From that
period a growing taste for Asiatic luxuries may
be traced in every country of Europe, and the
number of ships fitted out for that trade at
Lisbon, continued to increase every year'.

V. LUCRATIVE as the trade with India was,

and had long been deemed, it is remarkable that
the Portuguese were suffered to remain in the
undisturbed and exclusive possession of it, during
the course of almost a century. In the ancient
world, though Alexandria, from the peculiar
felicity of its situation, could carry on an inter-
course with the East by sea, and circulate its
producions through Europe with such advan-
tage, as gave it a decided superiority over every
rival; yet various attempts (which have been
described in their proper places) were made,
from time to time, to obtain some flare in a
commerce so apparently beneficial. From the

S EC T. growing aacivity of the commercial spirit in the
. ;.. sixteenth century, as well as from the example

of the eager solicitude with which the Venetians
and Genoese exerted themselves alternately to
hfut out each other from any ihare in the Indian
trade, it might have been expected that some
competitor would have arisen to call in question
the claim of the Portuguese to an exclusive right
of traffic with the Eaff, and to wrest from them
some portion of it. There were, however, at
that time, some peculiar circumstances in the
political state of all those nations in Europe,
whose intrusion, as rivals, the Portuguese had
any reason to dread, which secured to them the
quiet enjoyment of their monopoly of Indian
commerce, during such a long period. From
the accession of Charles V. to the throne, Spain
was either so much occupied in a multiplicity of
operations in which it was engaged by the am-
bition of that monarch, and of his son Philip II.
or so intent on profccuting its own discoveries
and conquests in the New World, that, although,
&D. z52. by the successful enterprize of Magellan, its

fleets were unexpectedly condu6ted by a new
course to that remote region of Asia which was
the feat of the most gainful and alluring branch
of trade carried on by the Portuguese, it could
make no considerable effort to avail itself of the
commercial advantages which it might have

derived

derived from that event. By the acquisition of s Ec ?T
the crown of Portugal, in the year one thousand -
five hundred and eighty, the kings of Spain, in-
stead of the rivals, became the protecors of the
Portuguese trade, and the guardians of all its
exclusive rights. Throughout the sixteenth cen-
tury, the strength and resources of France were
so much wafted by the fruitless expeditions of
their.monarchs into Italy, by their unequal con-
test with the power and policy of Charles V.
and by the calamities of the civil wars which
desolated the kingdom upwards of forty years,
that it could neither bestow much attention
upon objecs of commerce, nor engage in any
scheme of distant enterprize. The Venetians,
how sensibly soever they might feel the morti-
fying reverse of being excluded, almost entirely,
from the Indian trade, of which their capital had
been formerly the chief feat, were so debilitated
and humbled by the League of Cambray, that
they were no longer capable of engaging in any
undertaking of magnitude. England, weakened
(as was formerly observed) by the long contest
between the houses of York and Lancaster, and
just beginning to recover its proper vigour, was
restrained from acfive exertion, during one part
of the sixteenth century, by the cautious
maxims of Henry VII. and wafted its strength,
during another part of it, by engaging incon.

X ; _ the continent. The nation, though destined to

acquire territories in India more extensive and
valuable than were ever poffefled by any Euro-
pean power, had no such presentiment of its fu-
ture eminence there, as to take an early part in
the commerce or tranfaRions of that country,
and a great part of the century elapsed before it
began to turn its attention towards the Eait.

WHILE the most considerable nations in Eu-

rope found it necessary, from the circumitances
which I have mentioned, to remain ina&ive
ipectators of what passed in the East, the Seven
United Provinces of the Low Countries, re-
cently formed into a small state, still itruggling
for political existence, and yet in the infancy
of its power, ventured to appear in the In-
dian ocean as the rivals of the Portuguese;
and, despising their pretensions to an exclusive
right of commerce with the extensive countries
to the eastward of the Cape of Good Hope, in-
vaded that monopoly which they had hitherto
guarded with such jealous attention. The Eng-
lifh soon followed the example of the Dutch,
and both nations, at first by the enterprizing
industry of private adventurers, and afterwards
by the more powerful efforts of trading com-
panies, under the protection of public autho-

rity,

rity, advanced with afRonifhing ardour and fuc- s zc T.
cess in this new career opened to them. The s-r-
vast fabric of power which the Portuguese had
erected in the East (a superstructure much too
large for the basis on which it had to reft) was
almost entirely overturned, in as short time, and
with as much facility, as it had been raised.
England and Holland, by driving them from
their most valuable fetdements, and seizing the
most lucrative branches of their trade, have
attained to that pre-eminence in naval power
and commercial opulence, by which they are
distinguished among the nations of Europe.

VI. THE co-incidence, in point of time, of

the discoveries made by Columbus in the Weft,
and those of Gama in the East, is a singular
circumstance, which merits observation, on ac-
count of the remarkable influence of those
events in forming or strengthening the com-
mercial connection of the different quarters of
the globe with each other. In all ages, gold
and silver, particularly the latter, have been
the commodities exported with the greatest
profit to India. In no part of the earth do the
natives depend so little upon foreign countries,
either for the necessaries or luxuries of life. The
blessings of a favourable climate and fertile foil,
augmented by their own ingenuity, afford them

~p~ whatever

s EV T. whatever they-defire. In consequence of this,

_ --. trade with them has always been carried on in

one uniform manner, and the precious metals
have been given in exchange for their peculiar
produtions, whether of nature or art. But
wher. the communication with India was ren-
dered so much more easy, that the demand for
its commodities began to increase far beyond
what had been formerly known, if Europe
had not been supplied with the gold and silver
which it was neceflary to carry to the markets
of the East from sources richer and more abun-
dant than her own barren and impoverished
mines, she must either have abandoned the trade
with India altogether, or have continued it with
manifest disadvantage. By such a continual
drain of gold and silver, as well as by the un-
avoidable wafe of both in circulation and in
manufa&tures, the quantity of those metals must
have gone on diminishing, and their value
would have been so much enhanced, that they
could not have continued long to be of the fame
utility in the commercial tranfations between
the two countries. But before the effc&s of
this diminution could be very sensibly felt, Ame-
rica opened her mines, and poured in treasures
upon Europe in the most copious stream to
which mankind ever had access. This treasure,
in spite of innumerable anxious precautions to

prevent

prevent it, flowed to the markets where the s 5 C T.
commodities necessary for supplying the wants, .,-<,
or gratifying the luxury of the Spaniards, were
to be found; and from that time to the present,
the English and Dutch have purchased the pro-
dutions of China and Indoftan, with silver
brought from the mines of Mexico and Peru.
The immense exportation of silver to the East,
during the course of two centuries, has not only
been replaced by the continual influx from Ame-
rica, but the quantity of it has been confider-
ably augmented, and at the fame time the
proportional rate of its value in Europe and in
India has varied so little, that it is chiefly with
silver that many of the capital articles imported
from the East are still purchased.

WHILE America contributed in this manner

to facilitate and extend the intercourse of Europe
with Asia, it gave rife to a traffic with Africa,
which, from slender beginnings, has become so
considerable, as to form the chief bond of com-
mercial connetion with that continent. Soon
after the Portuguese had extended their disco-
veries on the coast of Africa beyond the river
Senegal, they endeavoured to derive some be-
nefit from their new settlements there, by the
sale of slaves. Various circumstances combined
in favouring the revival of this odious traffic.

p 2 In

S Ec T. In every part of America, of which the Spa-

IV,
, i.v ' niards took pofleffion, they found that the na-

tives, from the fieblenefs of their frame, from
their indolence, or from the injudicious manner
of treating them, were incapable of the exer.
dons requisite either for working mines, or for
cultivating the earth. Eager to asnd hands more
indtiti-;,ous and efficient, the Spaniards had re-
course to their ntighb.urs the Portuguese, and
purchaftd from them negroe slaves. Experi-
ence soon discovered, that they were men of a
more hardy race, and so much better fitted for
enduring fatigue, that the labour of one negroe
was computed to be equal to that of four Ame-
ricans t; and from that time the number em-
ployed in the New World has gone on increaf-
ing with rapid progress. In this practice, no
less repugnant to the feelings of humanity than
to the principles of religion, the Spaniards have
unhapFii been imitated by all the nations of
Europe, "ho have acquired territories in the
warmer climates of the New World. At pre-
sent the number of negroe slaves in the fettle-
ments of Great Britain and France in the Weft
Indies, exceeds a milli-;n; and as the establish-
rrent of servitude has been found, both in an-
cient and in modern times, extremely unfavour,

able to population, it requires an annual importa- s E C T.
tion from Africa of at least fifty- eight thousand,
to keep up the stock'. If it were possible to
ascertain, with equal exatnefs, the number of
saves in the SpaniIh dominions, and in North
America, the total number of negroe slaves
might be well reckoned at as many more.

THUS the commercial genius of Europe,

which has given it a visible ascendant over the
three other divisions of the earth, by discerning
their refpe&ive wants and resources, and by
rendering them reciprocally subservient to one
another, has established an union among them,
from which it has derived an immense increase
ofopulence) of power, and of enjoyments.

VII. THOUGH the discovery of a New

World in the Weft, and the opening of a
more easy and direct communication with
the remote regions of the East, co-operated
towards extending the commerce, and adding
to the enjoyments, of Europe, a remarkable
difference may be observed, with respect both to
the time and the manner in which they produced
these effecs. When the Portuguese first visited

P 3 the

SE C T. the coast of Malabar to China, they found

them poflefied by nations highly civilized, which
had made considerable progress in elegant as
well as useful arts, which were accustomed
to intercourse with strangers, and well ac-
quainted with all the advantages of commerce.
But when the Spaniards began to explore the
New World which they discovered, the ape&t
which it presented to them was very different.
The islands were inhabited by naked savages,
so unacquainted with the simplest and most
necefrary arts of life, that they fubfirted chiefly
on the spontaneous produtions of a fertile
foil and genial climate. The continent ap-
peared to be a forest of immense extent, along
the coast of which were scattered some feeble
tribes, not greatly superior to the islanders in
industry or improvement. Even its two large
monarchies, which have been dignified with
the appellation of civilized states, had not ad.
vanced so far beyond their countrymen, as to
be entitled to that name. The inhabitants, both
of Mexico and Peru, unacquainted with the
useful metals, and destitute of the address requi-
site for acquiring such command of the inferior
animals as to derive any considerable aid from
their labour, had made so little progress in
agriculture, the firit of all arts, that one of the
greatest difficulties with which the small number

of

of Spaniards, who overturned those highly ex- s eC T.
tolled empires, had to struggle, was how to-pro- - 1-,
cure in them what was sufficient for their sub-
fiftence.

IT was of consequence, with a very different

spirit, that the intercourse with two countries,
resembling each other so little in their degree
of improvement, was begun and carried on. The
Portuguese, certain of finding in the East, not
only the productions with which the bountiful
hand of Nature has enriched that part of the
globe, but various manufa&ures which had long
been known and admired in Europe, engaged
in this alluring trade with the greatest eagerness.
The encouragement of it their monarchs con-
fidered as a chief object of government, towards
which they directed all the power of the king-
dom, and rouzed their fubjets to such vigor-
ous exertions in the prosecution of it, as oc-
cafioned that aftonilhing rapidity of progress
which I have described. The sanguine hopes
with which the Spaniards entered upon their
career of discovery, met not with the fame
speedy gratification. From the industry of
the rude inhabitants of the New World, they
did not receive a single article of commerce.
Even the natural producions of the foil and
climate, when not cherished and multiplied by

P 4 the

s zE T. the foitering and ative hand of man, were of

Ir.
u. J- little account. Hope, rather than fuccels,

incited them to perfill in extending their re-
searches and conquests; and as government de-
rived little immediate benefit from theft, it left
the proficition of them chiefly to private adven-
turers, by whose enterprizing activity, more
than by any effort of the Rate, the most valuable
pofleflions of Spain in America were acquired.
Instead of the instantaneous and great advan-
tages which the Portuguefc derived from their
discoveries, above half a century elapsed before
the Spaniards reaped any benefit of consequence
from their conquests, except the small quantities
of gold which the islanders were compelled
to collet, and the plunder of the gold and
silver employed by the Mexicans and Peruvians
as ornaments of their persons and temples, or
as utensils of sacred or domestic use. It was
not until the discovery of the mines of Potofi
in Peru, in the year one thousand five hundred
and forty-five, and of those of Sacotecas in
Mexico, loon after, that the Spanish territories
in the New WVorld brought a permanent and
valuable addition of wealth and revenue to the
m(aer country.

NOR did the trade with India differ more
from that with America, in refpe& of the par-

ticular

ticular circumstance which I have explained, s E, T.
than in refpec to the manner of carrying it on, k-
after it grew to be a considerable object of
political attention. Trade with the East was
a finmple mercantile tranfa&tion, confined to
the purchale either of the natural productions
of the country, such as spices, precious stones,
pearls, &c. or of the manufactures which
abounded among an industrious race of men,
such as fitk and cotton fluffs, porcelane, &c.
Nothing more was requisite in conducting
this trade, than to fetile a few fkiful agents in
proper places, to prepare a proper assortment
of goods f;,r completing the cargoes of flips
as soon as they arrived from Europe, or at the
utmost to acquire the command of a few for-
tified Rtations, which might secure them ad-
mission into ports where they might careen
in safety, and find protection from the insults
of any hostile power. There was no necelfity
of making any attempt to establish colonies.
either for the cultivation of the foil, or the
condua of manufa&ures. Both thelbe remained,
as formerly, in the hands of the natives.

Bur as soon as that wild spirit of enterprize,

which animated the Spaniards who firit explored
and subdued the New World, began to fiubfide,
and when, instead of roving as adventurers

1 1 from

a S C T. from province to province in quest of gold and

IV.
* ; silver, they seriously turned their thoughts towards

rendering their conquests beneficial by cultiva-
tion and indultry, they found it necessary to
establish colonies in every country which they
wilhed to improve. Other nations imitated
their example in the settlements which they
afterwards made in some of the islands, and on
the continent of North America. Europe, after
having desolated the New World, began to
repeople it, and under a system of colonization
(the spirit and regulations of which it is not
the obje& of this Disquisition to explain) the
European race has multiplied there amazingly.
Every article of commerce imported from the
New World, if we except the firs and skins
purchased from the independent tribes of hunters
in North America, and from a few tribes in
a similar state on the Southern continent, is
the produce of the industry of Europeans fettled
there. To their exertions, or to those of hands
which they have taught or compelled to labour,
we are indebted for sugar, rum, cotton, tobacco,
indigo, rice, and even the gold and silver ex-
traaed from the bowels of the earth. Intent
on those lucrative branches of industry, the in-
habitants of the New World pay little attention
to those kinds of labour which occupy a con-
liderable part of the members of other focieies,

and

and depend, in some measure, for their sub- S E C T.
fiftence, and entirely for every article'of elegance
and luxury, upon the ancient continent. Thus
the Europeans have become manufa&ctrers for
America, and their industry has been greatly
augmented by the vast demands for supplying
the wants of extensive countries, the population
of which is continually increasing. Nor is the
influence of this demand confined solely to the
nations which have a more immediate connec-
tion with the American colonies; it is felt in
every part of Europe that furnishes any article
exported to them, and gives activity and vigour
to the hand of the artisan in the inland pro-
vinces of Germany, as well as to those in Great
Britain and other countries, which carry on a
direc trade with the New World.

BUT while the discovery and conquest of

America is allowed to be one principal cause
of that rapid increase of industry and wealth,
which is conspicuous in Europe during the
two last centuries, some timid theorists have
maintained, that throughout the fame period
Europe has been gradually impoverished, by
being drained of its treasure, in order to
carry on its trade with India. But this appre-
henfion has arisen from inattention to the nature
and use of the precious metals. They are to

be

5z C T. be considered in two different lights; either
L. -J as the signs which all civilized nations have

agreed to employ, in order to eflimate or
represent the value both of labour and of all
commodities, and thus to facilitate the purchase
of the former, and the conveyance of the latter
from one proprietor to another; or gold and
ilver may be viewed as being themselves com-
modities or articles of commerce, for which
some equivalent must be given by filch as wilb
to acquire them. In this light, the export-
ation of the precious metals to the East should
be regarded; for, as the nation by which they
are exported must purchase them with the pro-
duce of its own labour and ingenuity, this trade
muff contribute, though not in the fame ob-
vious and direc manner as that with America,
towards augmenting the general industry and
opulence of Europe. If England, as the price
of Mexican and Peruvian dollars which are ne-
ceffary for carrying on its trade with India,
must give a certainl quantity of its woollen or
cott(I cloth or hard-ware, then the hands
of an additional number of manufacturers
are rendered active, and work to a certain
amount must be executed, for which, without
this t rade, there would not have been any
demand. The nation reaps all the benefit
arising from a new creation of industry. With

the

the gold and silver which her manufa&ures s E C T.
have purchased in the Weft, she is enabled to
trade in the markets of the East, and the ex-
portation of treasure to India, which has been
so much dreaded, instead of impoverishing,
enriches the kingdom.

VIII. IT is to the discovery of the paflage to

India by the Cape of Good Hope, and to the
vigour and success with which the. Portuguese
prosecuted their conquests and eftablilhed their
dominion there, that Europe has been indebted
for its preservation from the most illiberal and
humiliating servitude that ever oppressed po-
lithed nations. For this observation I am in-
debted to an Author, whose ingenuity has illus-
trated, and whose eloquence has adorned the His-
tory of the Settlelm ents and commerce of Modern
Nations in the East and Weft Indies'; and it
appears to me so well founded as to merit
more ample investigation, A few years after
the first appearance of the Portuguese in India,
the dominion of the Mameluks was overturned
by the irresistible power of the Turkish arms,
pnd Egypt and Syria were annexed as provinces
to the Ottoman empire. If after this event

- the Turkish Sultans, by being masters of Egypt

and Syria, must have possessed the absolute com-
mand of it, whether the productions of the East
were conveyed by the Red Sea to Alexandria,
or were transported by land-carriage from the
Persian Gulf to Constantinople, and the ports
of the Mediterranean. The monarchs who
were then at the head of this great empire,
were neither destitute of abilities to perceive
the pre-eminence to which this would have
elevattd th:em, nor of ambition to aspire to it.
Selim, i.:t ccnqueror of the Mameluks, by
confirming thc ancient privileges of the Vene-
tians in Egypt r-: Syria, and by his regula-
tions concerning -- duties on Indian goods,
which I have alre ,:y mentioned, early dif-
covered his folicitudt to secure all the ad-
vantages of commerce with the East to his
own dominions. The attention of Solyman
the Magnificent, his successor, seems to have
been equally direEted towards the fame obje&.
More enlightened than any monarch of the

he formed a scheme suitable to his character '*- .
for political wisdom and the appellation of Infii-
tutor of Rules, by which the Turkish Historians
have diftinguilhed him, and eftabliihed, early in
his reign, a system of commercial laws in his do-
minions, by which he hoped to render Conftan-
tinople the great staple of Indian trade, as it
had been in the prosperous ages of the Greek
empire k. For accomplilhing this scheme,
however, he did not rely on the operation of
laws alone; he fitted out about the fame time
a formidable fleet in the Red Sea, under the
conduct of a confidential officer, with such a
body of janizaries on board of it, as he A. C. t
deemed sufficient not only to drive the Portu-
guefe out of all their new Settlements in
India, but to take possession of some com-
modious station in that country, and to ere&
his standard there. The Portuguese, by es-
forts of valour and constancy, entitled to
the splendid success with which they were
crowned, repulsed this powerful armament in
every enterprize it undertook, and compelled

with the moit sanguine hopes of terminating
the expedition in a very different manner.
Solyman, though he never relinquiihed the
design of expelling the Portuguie:; from India,
and of acquiring some eftabliflment there, was
so occupied during the remainder of his reign,
by the multiplicity of arduous operations in
which an infariable ambition involved him, that
he never had leisure to resume the prosecution
of it widt vigour.

IF either the measures of Selim had produced

the effe& which he expe&ed, or if the more
adventurous and extensive plan of Solyman had
been carried into execution, the command of
the wealth of India, together with such a marine
as the monopoly of trade with that country

sessed it to create and maintain, must have
brought an accession of force to an empire
already formidable to mankind, that would

the despotic system of Turkish government,

I sHALL now endeavour to fulfil an en-

gagement which I came under', to make

some observations upon the genius, the manners,
and institutions of the people of India, as far
as they can be traced from the earliest ages
to which our knowledge of them extends. Were
I to enter upon this wide field with an intention
of surveying its whole extent; were I to view
each objet whith it presents to a philosophical
inquirer, under all its different afpefts, it would
lead me into researches and speculations, not
ohly of immense length, but altogether foreign
from the subjet of this Disquisition. My in-
quiries and reflections ihall therefore be con-
fined to what is intimately conne&ed with the

Q. 2 design

design of this work. I shall collect the facts
which the ancients have transmitted to us con-
cer.ing the institutions peculiar to the natives
of India, and, by comparing them with what
we now know of that country, endeavour to
deduce such conclusions as tend to point out
the circumstances which have induced the reft
of mal.kind, in every age, to carry on corn.
mercial intercourse to so great an extent with
that country.

OF this intercourse there are conspicuous

proofs in the earliest periods concerning which
history affords information. Not only the
people contiguous to India, but remote nations,
£cem to have been acquainted, from time im-
mminorial, with its commodities, and to have
valued them so highly, that in order to procure
them they undertook fatiguing, expensive, and
dangerous journeys. Whenever men give a
decided preference to the commodities of any
particular country, this muff be owing either
to its polleffing some valuable natural produc-
tions peculiar to its foil and climate, or to fonm
uliFerior progress which its inhabitants have
made in industry, art, and elegance. It is not
to any peculiar excellence in the natural produc-
tions of India, that we must ascribe entirely the
rredilesion of ancient nations for its commodi-

ties;

ties; for, pepper excepted, an article, it must
he allowed, of great importance, they are little
different from those of other tropical countries;
and Ethiopia or Arabia might have fully sup-
plied the Phenicians, and other trading people
of antiquity, with the spices, the perfumes,
the precious stones, the gold and silver, which
formed the principal articles of their com-
merce.

WHOEVER then withes to trace the commerce

with India to its source, must search for it, not
so much in any peculiarity of the natural pro-
duetions of that country, as in the superior im-
provement of its inhabitants. Many facts have
been transmitted to us, which, if they are ex-
amined with proper attention, clearly demon-
ftrate, that the natives of India were not only
more early civilized, but had made greater pro-
grefs in civilization than any other people.
These I shall endeavour to enumerate, and to
place them in such a point of view as may
serve both to throw light upon the inftitu-
tions, manners, and arts of the Indians, and to
account for the eagerness of all nations to
obtain the productions of their ingenious in.
duitry.

BY the ancient Heathen writers, the Indians
were reckoned among those races of men which

- 3 they

they denominated Autocbtbones or Aborigines,
whom they confidered as natives of the foil,
whose origin could not be tracedb. By the
inspired writers, the wisdom of the East (an
expreflion which is to be understood as a de.
scription of their extraordinary progress in
science and arts) was early celebrated'. In
order to illustrate and confirm these explicit
testimonies concerning the ancient and high
civilization of the inhabitants of India, I ihall
take a view of their rank and condition as
individuals; of their civil policy; of their laws
and judicial proceedings; of their useful and
elegant arts; of their sciences; and of their
religious institutions; as far as information can
be gathered from the accounts of the Greek
and Roman writers, compared with what flill
remains of their ancient acquirements and in.
ftitutions.

I. FROM the most ancient accounts of India

we learn, that the diftintion of ranks and fe-
paration of professions were completely efta-
bliihed there. This is one of the most un-
doubted proofs of a focicty considerably ad-
vanced in its progress. Arts in the early stages of
social life arc so few, and so simple, that each man
is sufficiently master of them all, to gratify every

demand

demand of his own limited desires. A savage
can form his bow, point his arrows, rear his hut,
and hollow his canoe, without calling in the
aid of any hand more skilful than his ownd.
But when time has augmented the wants of men,
the produ&tions of art become so complicated
in their ftruaure, or so curious in their fabric,
that a particular course of education is requisite
towards forming the artist to ingenuity in con-
trivance and expertness in execution. In pro-
portion as refinement spreads, the diftin&ion
of profeflions increases, and they branch out
into more numerous and minute subdivisions,
Prior to the records of authentic history, and
even before the most remote aera to which their
own traditions pretend to reach, this reparation
of profcffions had not only taken place among
the natives of India, but the perpetuity of it was
secured by an institution which must bq con-
fidered as the fundamental article in the fyflenm
of their policy. The whole body of the people
was divided into four orders or casts. The
members of the first, deemed the most sacred,
had it for their province, to study the prin-
ciples of religion; to perform its functions;
and to cultivate the kciences. They were the
priests, the inftrutors, and philosophers of the

nation. The members of the efcond order
were entrusted with the government and defence
of the state. In peace they were its rulers and
magistrates, in war they were the generals who
commanded its armies and the soldiers who
fought its battles. The third was composed
of hutbandmen and merchants; and the fourth
of artisans, labourers, and servants. None
of these can ever quit his own cafl, or be ad-
mitted into another . The station of every
individual is unalterably fixed; his destiny
is irrevocable; and the walk of life is marked
out, from which he must never deviate. This
line of separation is not only eflablil'hed by
civil authority, but confirmed and RanEtioned
by religion; and each order or cast is said
to have proceeded from the Divinity in such
a different manner, that to mingle and con-
found them would be deemed an act of most
daring impiety '. Nor is it between the
four different tribes alone that such infupe-
rable barriers are fixed; the members of each
cast adhere invariably to the profeTion of
their forefathers. From generation to ge-
neration, the fame families have followed,

and

and will always continue to follow, one uniform

ene of life.

SUCH arbitrary arrangements of the various

members which compose a community, seem,
at first view, to be adverse to improvement
either in science or in arts; and by forming
around the different orders of men artificial
barriers, which it would be impious to pass,
tend to circumscribe the operations of the human
mind within a narrower sphere than nature has
allotted to them. When every man is at full
liberty to diret his efforts towards thcfe objects
and that end which the impulse of his own mind
prompts him to prefer, he may be expected
to attain that high degree of eminence to which
the uncontrouled exertions of genius and industry
naturally conduct. The regulations of Indian
policy, with relpe& to the different orders of
men, must necessarily, at some times, check
genius in its career, and confine to the funtions
of an inferior cast, talents fitted to (hine in an
higher sphere. But the arrangements of civil
government are made, not for what is extraor-
dinary, but for what is common; not for the
few, but for the many. The object of the
first Indian legislators was to employ the most
effectual means of providing for the subsistence,
the security, and happiness of all the membrs

4 of

of the community over which they presided.
With this view they set apart certain races
of men for each of the various professions
and arts necessary in a well-ordered society,
and appointed the exercise of them to be tranf-
mitted from father to son in fucceflion. This
system, though extremely repugnant to the
ideas which we, by being placed in a very dif-
ferent state of society, have formed, will be
found, upon attentive infpedion, better adapted
to attain the end in view, than a careless ob-
server, at first fight, is apt to imagine. The
human mind bends to the law of necessity, and
is accustomed, not only to accommodate itself to
the restraints which the condition of its nature, or
the inffitutions of its country, impose, but to ac-
quiefce in them. From his entrance into life, an
Indian knows the station allotted to him, and the
funEtions to which he is destined by his birth.
The objecs which relate to these, are the firRt that
present themselves to his view. They occupy
his thoughts, or employ his hands; and, from
his earliest years, he is trained to the habit of
doing with ease and pleasure, that which he must
continue through life to do. To this may be
ascribed that high degree of perfection con-
fpicuous in many of the Indian manufatures;
and though veneration for the practices of
their anccltors may check the spirit of inven-

3 tion,

tion, yet, by adhering to these, they acquire
such an expertness and delicacy of hand, that
Europeans, with all the advantages of superior
tience, and the aid of more complete inftru-
ments, have never been able to equal the ex-
quifite execution of their workmanship. While
this high improvement of their more curious
manufactures excited the admiration, and at-
traated the commerce of other nations, the
fieparation of professions in India, and the early
distribution of the people into classes, attached
to particular kinds of labour, secured such abund-
ance of the more common and useful commodi.
ties, as not only supplied their own wants, but mi-
niftered to those of the countries around them.

To this early division of the people into

casts, we must likewise ascribe a striking pecu-
liarity in the state of India; the permanence
of its institutions, and the immutability in the
manners of its inhabitants. What now is in
India always was there, and is likely still
to continue: neither the ferocious violence and
illiberal fanaticism of its Mahomedan conquerors,
nor the power of its European matiers, hav-
effeced any considerable alteration Z. The fame

arrange-

arrangements in civil and domestic society
remain, the fame maxims of religion are held
in veneration, and the fame sciences and arts
are cultivated. Hence, in all ages, the trade
with India has been the fame; gold and silver
have uniformly been carried thither in order
to purchase the fame commodities with which
it now supplies all nations; and from the age
of Pliny to the present times, it has been always
confidered and execrated as a gulf which fwal-
lows up the wealth of every other country,
that flows incessantly towards it, and from which
it never returns'. According to the accounts
which I have given of the cargoes anciently
imported from India, they appear to have con-
fited of nearly the fame articles with those of
the investments in our own times; and what-
ever difference we may observe in them seems
to have arisen, not so much from any diversity
in the nature of the commodities which the
Indians prepared for sale, as from a variety in
the taftes or in the wants, of the nations which
demanded them.

II. ANOTHER proof of the early and high

civilization of the people of India, may be
deduced from confidering their political con-

h Sec NOTE LX.

flitution

ititution and form of government. The Indians
trace back the history of their own country
through an immense succession of ages, and
assert, that all Asia, from the mouth of the
Indus on the weft, to the confines of China
on the east, and from the mountains of Thibet
on the north, to Cape Comorin on the south,
formed a vait empire, subje&t to one mighty
sovereign, under whom ruled several hereditary
Princes and Rajahs. But their chronology,
which measures the life of man in ancient times
by thousands of years, and computes the length
of the several periods, during which it filppofes
the world to have existed, by millions, is so
wildly extravagant, as not to merit any serious
difcuflion. We must reft satisfied, then, until
some more certain information is obtained with
refpe&t to the ancient history of India, with
taking the first accounts of that country, which
can be deemed authentic, from the Greeks,
who served under Alexander the Great. They
found kingdoms of considerable magnitude
established in that country. The territories
of Porus and of Taxiles comprehended a great
part of the Panjab, one of the most fertile and
bell cultivated countries in India. The king-
dom of the Prafij, or Gandarida, stretched
to a great extent on both fides of the Ganges.
All the three, as appears from the ancient Greek
writers, were powerful and populous.

THIS

'trHI description of the partition of Irdia

into Rates of such magnitude, is alone a con-
vincing proof of its having advanced far in
civilization. In whatever region of the earth
there has been an opportunity of observing the.
progress of men in social life, they appear at first
in small independent tribes or communities,
Their common wants prompt them to unite;
and their mutual jealousies, as well as the necef-
fity of securing fubfitlence, compel them to
drive to a distance every rival who might en-
croach on those domains which they confider as
their own. Many ages elapse before they
coalesce, or acquire sufficient foresight to pro-
vide for the wants, or sufficient wisdom to con-
du&t the affairs of a numerous society. Even
under the genial climate, and in the rich foil of
India, more favourable perhaps to the union and
increase of the human species than any other
part of the globe, the formation of such exten-
five flares, as were established in that country
when first visited by Europeans, mull have been
a work of long time; and the members of them
must have been long accustomed to exertions of
useful industry.

THOUoH monarchical government was efta-

blirhed in all the countries of India to which the
knowledge of the ancients extended, the fove-
rcigns were far from poffcfling uncontrouled or

despotic

tlefpotic power. No trace, indeed, is disco-
vered there of any assembly or public body, the
members of which, either in their own right, or
as representatives of their fellow-citizens, could
interpofc in enacting laws, or in superintending
the execution of them. Infitutions destined to
assert and guard the rights belonging to men in
a social state, how familiar soever the idea
may be to the people of Europe, never formed
a part of the political conllitution in any great
Asiatic kingdom. It was to different principles
that the natives of India were indebted for re-
ftritions which limited the exercise of regal
power. The rank of individuals was unalter-
ably fixed, and the privileges of the different
cafls were deemed inviolable. The monarchs
of India, who are all taken from the second of
the four claffles formerly described, which is
intrusted with the funcions of government and
exercise of war, behold among their subje&s an
order of men far superior to themselves in
dignity, and so conscious of their own pre-
eminence, both in rank and in fantity, that they
would deem it degradation and pollution, if they
were to eat of the fame food with their fove-
reign k. Their persons are sacred, and even for
the most heinous crimes they cannot be capitally

punished;

punilhed; their blood must never be Ihed'. To
mrn in this exalted iation monarchs mufl look
up with refpec, and reverence them as the mi-
nifters of religion, and the teachers of wisdom.
On important occasions, it is the duty of fove-
reigns to consult them, and to be directed by
their advice, Their admonitions, and even their
censures, must be received with fubmiflive re-
spect. This right of the Brahmins to offer their
opinion with refpec to the administration of
public affairs was not unknown to the ancients;'
and in some accounts preserved in India of the
events which happened in their own country,
princes are mentioned, who, having violated
the privileges of'the casts, and disregarded the'
remonstrances of the Brahmins, were deposed
by their authority, and put to death ".

WHTLE the sacred rights of the Brahmins

opposed a barrier against the encroachments of
regal power on the one hand, it was circum-
fcribed on the other by the ideas which those
who occupied the highest stations in society en-
tertained of their own dignity and privileges.

As

As none but the members of the cast next in
rank to that which religion has rendered sacred,
could be employed in any function of the state,
the sovereigns of the extensive kingdoms an-
ciently established in India, found it necessary to
entrust them with the superintendence of the
cities and provinces too remote to be under
their own immediate infpeaion. In these fta-
tions they often acquired such wealth and influ-
ence, that offices conferred during pleasure,
continued hereditarily in their families, and they
came gradually to form an intermediate order
between the sovereign and his subje&s; and, by
the vigilant jealousy with which they maintained
their own dignity and privileges, they con-
trained their rulers to refpe& them, and to
govern with moderation and equity.

NOR were the benefits of these restraints

upon the power of the sovereign confined wholly
to the two superior orders in the state; they
extended, in some degree, to the third class
employed in agriculture. The labours of that
numerous and useful body of men are so effen-
tial to the preservation and happiness of society,
that the greatest attention was paid to render
their condition fccure and comfortable. Ac-
cording to the ideas which prevailed among the
natives of India (as we are informed by the

D. firit

first Europeans who visited their country), the
sovereign is confidered as the sole universal
proprietor of all the land in his dominions, and
from him is derived every species of tenure by
which his fubjets can hold it. These lands
were let out to the farmers who cultivated them,
at a stipulated rent, amounting usually to a fourth
part of their annual produce paid in kind . In
a country where the price of work is extremely
low, and where the labour of cultivation is very
inconsiderable, the earth yielding its produtions
almost spontaneously, where subsistence is ama-
zingly cheap, where few clothes are needed, and
houses are built and furnished at little expence,
this rate cannot be deemed exorbitant or oppref-
five. As long as the husbandman continued to
pay the efrablified rent, he retained poffeflion
of the farm, which descended, like property,
from father to son.

THESE accounts given by ancient authors of

the condition and tenure of the renters of land
in India, agree so perfectly with what now takes
place, that it may be confidered almost as a
description of the present slate of its cultivation.

name by which the renters of land are diftin-
guiflhed, hold their possessions by a lease, which
may be ccnfidered as perpetual, and at a rate
fixed by ancient surveys and valuations. This
arrangement has been so long established, and
accords so well with the ideas of the natives,
concerning the diftintions of casts, and the
functions allotted to each, that it has been in-
violably maintained in all the provinces fubje&
either to Mahomedans or Europeans; and, to
both, it serves as the basis on which their whole
siftem of finance is founded P. In . more re-
mote period, before the original institutions of
India were subverted by foreign invaders, the
industry of the hulbandman, on which every
member of the community depended for lub-
fifence, was as secure as the tenure by which he
held his lands was equitable. Even war did not
interrupt his labours or endanger his property.
It was not uncommon, we are informed, that
while two hostile armies were fighting a battle
in one field, the peasants were ploughing or
reaping in the next field in perseEt tranquillity q.
These maxims and regulations of the ancient
legislators of India have a near resemblance to
the system of those ingenious speculators on
political ceconomy in modern times, who re-
P See N 0 T E LXI. q Strab. lib. xv. p. 103o. A.

t 2 present

present the produce of land as the sole source of
wealth in every country; and who confider the
discovery of this principle, according to which
they contend that the government of nations
flhould be conduced, as one of the greatest
efforts of human wisdom. Under a form of
government, which paid such attention to all the
different orders of which the society is com-
posed, particularly the cultivators of the earth,
it is not wonderful that the ancients fould
describe the Indians as a molf happy race of
men; and that the most intelligent modern ob-
servers should celebrate the equity, the huma-
nity, and mildness of Indian policy. A Hindoo
Rajah, as I have been informed by persons well
acquainted with the state of India, resembles
more a father preliding in a numerous family of
his own children, than a sovereign ruling over
inferiors, subjet to his dominion. He endea-
vours to secure their happiness with vigilant
solicitude; they are attached to him with the
most tender affection and inviolable fidelity.
We can hardly conceive men to be placed in
any state more favourable to their acquiring all
the advantages derived from social union. It is
only when the mind is perfectly at ease, and
neither feels nor dreads opprefflon, that it em-
ploys its acive powers in forming numerous
arrangements-of police, for securing its enjoy-

ments

ments and increasing them. Many arrange-
ments of this nature the Greeks, though
accustomed to their own institutions, the most
perfec at that time in Europe, observed and
admired among the Indians, and mention them
as instances of high civilization and improve-
ment. There were established among the In-
dians three diflint classes of officers, one of
which had it in charge to inspect agriculture,
and every kind of country work. They mea-
fured the portions of land allotted to each
renter. They had the custody of the Tanks, or
public reservoirs of water, without a regular
distribution of which, the fields in a torrid cli-
mate cannot be rendered fertile. They marked
out the course of the highways, along which, at
certain distances, they erected stones, to mea-
sure the road and direct travellers'. To officers
of a second class was committed the infpetion
of the police in cities; their funtions, of course,
were many and various; some of which only I
shall specify. They appropriated houfts for the
reception of strangers; they protected them from
injury, provided for their fubiftence, and, when
Icized with any disease, they appointed phyfi-
cians to attend them; and, on the event of their
death, they not only buried them with decency,

'See NOTE LXIL

. 3 but

but took charge of their effe&s, and restored
them to their relations. They kept exac re-
gifters of births and of deaths. They visited the
public markets, and examined weights and
measures. The third class of officers fuperin-
tended the military department; but, as the
objects to which their attention was directed are
foreign from the subject of my inquiries, it is
unneceflary to enter into any detail with refpet
to them'.

As manners and cufroms in India descend

almost without variation from age to age, many
of the peculiar institutions which I have enu-
merated frill subsist there. There is flill the
fame attention to the conftrution and preferva-
tion of tanks, and the distribution of their wa-
ters. The direction of roads, and placing stones
along them, is still an object of police. Choul-
tries, or houses built for the accommodation
of travellers, are frequent in every part of the
country, and are useful as well as noble monu-
ments of Indian munificence and humanity. It
is only among men in the most improved slate
of society, and under the berl forms of govern-
ment, that we discover institutions similar to

5 Strabo, lib. xv. p. 1034. A, &c. Diod. Sicul,
lib. ii. p. i54.

those

those which I have described; and many nations
have advanced far in their progress, without
eftablifling arrangements of police equally
perfect.

II. IN estimating the progress which any

nation has made in civilization, the obje&t that
merits the greatest degree of attention, next to
its political constitution, is the spirit of the laws
and nature of the forms by which its judicial
proceedings are regulated. In the early and
rude ages of society, the few disputes with re-
fpet to property which arise, are terminated by
the interposition of the old men, or by the
authority of the chiefs in every small tribe or
community; their decisions are ditated by their
own discretion, or founded on plain and ob-
vious maxims of equity. But as the controver-
fies multiply, cafes similar to such as have been
formerly determined must recur, and the
awards upon these grow gradually into prece-
dents, which serve to regulate future judgments.
Thus, long before the nature of property is
defined by positive flatutes, or any rules pre-
fcribed concerning the mode of acquiring or
conveying it, there is gradually formed, in
every state, a body of customary or common
law, by which judicial proceedings are directed,
and every decision conformable to it is filbmitted

R 4 t

to with reverence, as the result of the accumu.
lated wisdom and experience of ages.

Ix this state the administration ofjuftice seems

to have been in India when first visited by Eu-
ropeans. Though the Indians, according to
their account, had no written laws, but deter-
mined every controverted point, by recolle&ing
what had been formerly decided'; they assert,
that justice was dispensed among them with
great accuracy, and that crimes were most
frverely punished". But in this general ob-
servation is contained all the intelligence which
the ancients furnish concerning the nature and
forms of judicial proceedings in India. From
the time of Megafthenes, no Greek or Roman
of any note appears to have resided long enough
in the country, or to have been so much ac-
quainted with the cufoms of the natives, as to
be capable of entering into any detail with re-
fpc to a point of so great importance in their
policy. Fortunately, the defects of their in-
formation have been amply supplied by the more
accurate and extensive researches of the mo-
derns. During the cour!e of almost three cen-
turies, the number of persons who have retorted

from

from Europe to India has been great. Many
of them, who have remained long in the coun-
try, and were persons of liberal education and
enlarged minds, have lived in such familiar in-
tercourfe with the natives, and acquired so com-
petent a knowledge of their languages, as enabled
them to observe their institutions with attention,
and to describe them with fidelity. Refpetable
as their authority may be, I fliall not, in what
I offer for illustrating the judicial proceedings
of the Hindoos, reft upon it alone, but shall
derive my information from fourcqs higher and
more pure.

TOWARDS the middle of the sixteenth cen-

tury, Akber the sixth, in descent from Tamer-
lane, mounted the throne of Indoftan. He is
one of the few sovereigns intitled to the appel-
lation both of Great and Good, and the only
one of Mahomedan race, whose mind ap-
pears to have risen so far above all the illiberal
prejudices of that fanatical religion in which he
was educated, as to be capable of forming a plan
worthy of a monarch who loved his people, and
was solicitous to render them happy. As, in
every province of his extensive dominions, the
Hinidoos formed the great body of his fubjeAs,
he laboured to acquire a perfec knowledge of
their religion, their sciences, their laws, and in-

In this generous una !:r.g ie was icconded
with zeal by his vizier A-- u Fazei, a minister
whose understanding was no: lets enlightened
than. that of his master. By their assiduous
rcrfarches, and consultation of learned men ',
such information was obtained as enabled Abul
Fazel to publish a brief compendium of Hindoo
jurilprudence in the Ayeen Akbery Z, which
may be confidered as the first genuine com-
munication of its principles to persons of a dif-
.D. 1,73. ferent religion. About two centuries afterwards,

the illustrious example of Akber was imi-
tated and surpassed by Mr. Hastings, the Go-
vernor General of the British Settlements in
India. By his authority, and under his infpec-
tion, the most eminent Pundits, or Brahmins
learned in the laws, of the provinces over which
he presided, were assembled at Calcutta; and,
in the coui it of two years, compiled, from their
most ancient and approved authors, sentence by
lentence, without addition or diminution, a full
code of Hindoo lawsl; which is, undoubtedly,

the

the molt valuable and authentic elucidation of
Indian policy and manners that has been hither:o
communicated to Europe.

AccoRDING to the Pundits, some of the

writers upon whole authority they found the de-
crees which they have inserted in the Code,
lived several millions of years before their time b
and they boast of having a succession of ex-
pounders of their laws from that period to the
present. Without entering into any examination
of what is so extravagant, we may conclude,
that the Hindoos have in their pofteflion treatises
concerning the laws and jurisprudence of their
country, of more remote antiquity than' are to
be found in any other nation. The truth of
this depends not upon their own teflimony alone,
but it is put beyond doubt by one circumstance,
that all these treatises are written in the Sanfkreet
language, which has not been spoken for many
ages in any part of Indoftan, and is now under-
stood by none but the most learned Brahmins.
That the Hindoos were a people highly civil-
ized, at the time when their laws were com-
posed, is most clearly eftablitled by internal
evidence contained in the Code itfclf. Among
pations beginning to emerge from barbarism,

the regulations of law are extremely simple,
and applicable only to a few obvious cafes of
daily occurrence. Men must have been long
united in a social state, their transactions must
have been numerous and complex, and judges
must have determined an immense variety of
controversies to which these give rife, before
the system of law becomes so voluminous and
comprehensive as to dire& the judicial proceed-
ings of a nation far advanced in improvement.
In that early age of the Roman republic, when
the laws of the Twelve Tables were promul-
gated, nothing more was required than the
laconic injunctions which they contain for regu-
lating the decisions of courts of jufice; but,
in a later period, the body of civil law, ample
as its contents are, was found hardly sufficient
for that purpose. To the jejune brevity of the
Twelve Tables, the Hindoo Code has no re-
semblance, but with refpec to the number and
-variety of points it confiders, it will bear a com-
parison with the celebrated Digest of Justinian;
or with the systems of jurisprudence in nations
most highly civilized. The articles of which
the Hindoo Code is composed, are arranged in
natural and luminous order. They are nu-
merous and comprehensive, and investigated
with that minute attention and difcerninent
rshich are natural to a people diflinguifhed for

acute-

acuteness and fubtility of understanding, who
have been long accustomed to the accuracy
of judicial proceedings, and acquainted with
all the refinements of legal praAice. The de-
cifions concerning every point (with a few
exceptions occasioned by local prejudices and
peculiar customs) are founded upon the great
and immutable principles of justice which the
human mind acknowledges and refpec's, in
every age, and in all parts of the earth. Who-
ever examines the whole work, cannot enter-
tain a doubt of its containing the jurisprudence
of an enlightened and commercial people.
Whoever looks into any particular title, will
be surprised with a minuteness of detail and
nicety of diftintion, which, in many initances,
seem to go beyond the attention of European
legislation; and it is remarkable that some of
the regulations which indicate the greatest de-

of the most remote antiquity. "( In the first

its branches, has been greatly indebted,)

It is likewise worthy of notice, that though the
natives of India have been diiiinguilhed in
every age for the humanity and mildnels of
their disposition, yet such is the solicitude of
their law-givers to preserve the order and tran-
quillity of focicty, that the punifiments which
they inflict on criminals, are (agreeably to an
obfcrvation of the ancients already mentioned)
extremely rigorous. " Punishment (according

" inspirer of terror; punishment is the nourisher

of the fubjets; punishment is the defender

individuals, or as members of society, appears,
from the preceding investigation, to have been
extremely favourable to the cultivation of useful
and elegant arts; we are naturally led to en-
quire, whether the progress which they actually
made in them, was such as might have been
expected from a people in that situation. In
attempting to trace this progress, we have not
the benefit of guidance equal to that which
conducted our researches concerning the former
articles of enquiry. The ancients, from their
slender acquaintance with the interior slate of
India, have been able to communicate little
information with refpet to the arts cultivated
there; and though the moderns, during their
continued intercourse with India for three cen-
turies, have had access to observe them with
greater attention, it is of late only, that by
studying the languages now and formerly ipoken
in India, and by consulting and translating
their most eminent authors, they have bel.n
to enter into that path of enquiry which leads
with certainty to a thorough knowledge of the
slate of arts cultivated in that country.

ONE of the first arts which human ingenuity

aimed at improving, bevond what mere nccefl.t
requires, was that of building. In the brief re--

marks which the subjet of my inquiries leads
me to make on the progress of this art in India,
I shall confine my attention wholly to those of
highest antiquity. The most durable monu-
ments of human industry are public buildings.
The productions of art formed for the common
purposes of life, waste and perilh in using them;
but works destined for the benefit of posterity
subsist through ages, and it is according to
the manner in which these are executed, that
we form a judgment with refpe& to the de-
gree of power, ikill, and improvement to which
the people by whom they were erected had
attained. In every part of India monuments
of high antiquity are found. These are
of two kinds, such as were consecrated to the
offices of religion, or fortrelies built for the
security of the country. In the former of these,
to which Europeans, whatever their ftrufture
may be, give the general name of Pagodas,
we may observe a diversity of tik, which both
marks the gradual progress of architecture,
and throws light on the general fate of arts
and manners in different periods. The most
early Pagodas appear to have been nothing
more than excavations in mountainous parts
of the country, formed probably in imitation
of the ra;ural caverns to which the first in-

habitants

habitants of the earth retired for fafcty during
the night, and where they found shelter from
the inclemency of the seasons. The most
celebrated, and, as there is reason to believe,
the most ancient of all these, is the Pagoda
in the ifand Elephanta, at no great distance
from Bombay. It has been hewn by the hands
of man out of a solid rock, about half way up
a high mountain, and formed into a spacious
area, nearly io2 feet square. In order to sup-
port the roof, and the weight of the mountain
that lies above it, a number of massy pillars,
and of a form not inelegant, have been cut out of
the fame rock, at filch regular distances, as on
the first entrance presents to the eye of the spec-
tator an appearance both of beauty and of
strength. Great part of the inside is covered
with human figures in high relief, of gigantic
size as well as singular forms, and dillinguilhed
by a variety of symbols, representing; it is pro-
bable, the attributes of the deities whom they
worlhipped, or the actions of the heroes whom
they admired. In the isle of Salfette, fill
nearer to Bombay, are excavations in a similar
file, hardly inferior in magnificence, and def-
tined for the fame religious purposes.

THESE stupendous works are of such high
antiquity, that as the natives cannot, either from

s hiitory,

history or tradition, give any information cor.cern.
ing the time in which they were executed, they
universally ascribe the formation of them to the
power of superior beings. From the extent
and grandeur of these subterraneous mansions,
which intelligent travellers compare to the
most celebrated monuments of human power
and art in any part of the earth, it is manifest
that they could not have been formed in that
stage of social life where men continue divided
into small tribes, unaccustomed to the effort
of persevering industry. It is only in States
of considerable' extent, and among people long
habituated to subordination, and to at with
concert, that the idea of such magnificent works
is conceived, or the power of accomplilhing
them can be found.

THAT tome such powerful state was efta-

blified in India at the time when the excavations
in the islands of Elephanta and Salfette were
formed, is not the only conclusion to be drawn
from a survey of them; the stile in which the
sculptures with which they are adorned is ex-
ecured, indicates a considerable improvement
in art at that early period. Sculpture is the
imitative art in which man seems to have made
the first trial of his own talents. But even in
tho"e countries where it has attained to the

highest

highest degree of perfecion, its progress has
been extremely flow. Whoever has attended
to the history of this art in Greece, knows how
far removed the first rude elray to reprefcnt
the human form, was from any complete de-
lineation of it'. But the different groupes of
figures which still remain entire in the Pagoda
of Elephanta, however low they muff rank if
they be compared with the more elegant works
of Grecian or even Etruscan artists, are finilhed
in a stile considerably superior to the hard, in-
expreflive manner of the Egyptians, or to the
figures in the celebrated palace of Persepolis.
In this light they have appeared to persons
abundantly qualified to appretiate their merit,
and from different drawings, particularly those
of Niebuhr, a traveller equally accurate iEl
observing, and faithful in describing, we must
form a favourable opinion of the fiate of arts in
India at that period,

IT is worthy of notice, that although several

of the figures in the caverns at Elephanta be
so different from those now exhibited in the
Pagodas as objecs of veneration, that some
learned Europeans have imagined they rcpre-

sent the rites of a religion more ancient than
that now established in Indoftan, yet by the
Hindoos themselves the caverns are confidered
as hallowed places of their own worship, and
they flill resort thither to perform their devo-
tions, and honour the figures there, in the fame
manner with those in their own Pagodas. In
confirmation of this, I have been informed by
an intelligent observer, who visited this fubter-
raneous fancuary in the year 1782, that he was
accompanied by a sagacious Brahmin, a native
of Benares, who, though he had never been
in it before that-time, recognized, at once, all
the figures; was well acquainted with the pa-
rentage, education, and life of every deity or
human personage there represented, and ex-
plained with fluency the meaning of the various
symbols by which the images were distinguished.
This may be confidered as a clear proof that
the system of mythology now prevalent in
Benares, is not different from that delineated
in the caverns of Elephanta. Mr. Hunter,
who visited Elephanta in the year 1784, seems
to confider the figures there as representing
deities who are fill objects of worlhip
among the Hindoos . One circumstance serves
to confirm the justness of this opinion. Several

of the most conspicuous personages in the
groupes at Elephanta are decorated with the
Zennar, the sacred string or cord peculiar to
the order of Brahmins, an authentic evidence
of the diftin&ion of calls having been efta-
blifhedin India at the time when these works
were finished.

2. INSTEAD of caverns, the original places

of worship, which could be formed only in
particular situations, the devotion of the people
soon began to raise temples in honour of their
deities in other parts of India. The ftruEture
of these was at first extremely simple. They
were pyramids of large dimension, and had no
light within but what came from a small door.
After having been long accustomed to perform
all the rites of religion in the gloom of caverns,
the Indians were naturally led to confider the
solemn darkness of such a mansion as sacred.
Some Pagodas in this first stile of building still
remain in Indoftan. Drawings of two of these
at Deogur, and of a third near Tanjore in the
Carnatic, all fabrics of great antiquity, have
been published by Mr. HodgesL, and though
they are rude ftrutures, they are of such mag-
nitude as mufl have required the power of
some considerable state to rear them.

3. IN proportion to the progress of the dif.

ferent countries of India in opulence and refine.
ment, the structure of their temples gradually
improved. From plain buildings they became
highly ornamented fabrics, and, both by their
extent and magnificence, are monuments of
the power and taste of the people by whom they
were erected. In this highly finilhed stile there
are Pagodas of great antiquity in different parts
of Indoflan, particularly in the Southern pro-
vinces, which were not exposed to the deftruc-
tive vio!cnce of Mahomedan zeal. In order
to aflift my readers in forming such an idea
of these buildings as may enable them to judge
with refpet to the early ltate of arts in India,
I shall briefly describe two, of which we have
the most accurate accounts. The entry to the
Pagoda of Chillambrum near Porto Novo,
on the Corornandel coast, held in high venera-
tion on account of its antiquity, is by a flately
gate under a pyramid an hundred and twenty-
two feet in height, built with large flones above
forty feet long, and more than five feet square,
and ail covered with plates of copper, adorned
vwith an immense variety of figures neatly ex-
ecuted. The whole structure extends one

one direction, and nine hundred and thirty-fix in

another. Some of the ornamental parts are
finified with an elegance intitled to the admi-
ration of the most ingenious artists'. The Pa-
goda of Seringham, superior in san&ity to that
of Chillambrum, surpasses it as much in gran-
deur; and, fortunately, I can convey a more
perfec idea of it by adopting the words of an
elegant and accurate historian. This Pagoda
is situated about a mile from the western ex-
tremity of the ifand of Seringham, formed by
the division of the great river Caveri into two
channels. " It is composed of seven square
" inclofures, one within the other, the walls

of which are twenty-five feet high, and four

" thick. These inclofures are three hundred and
' fifty feet distant from one another, and each

has four large gates with a high tower; which
" are placed, one in the middle of each fide

of the inclofure, and opposite to the four

" cardinal points. The outward wall is near
"four miles in circumference, and its gateway
" to the South is ornamented with pillars, several
: of which are single stones thirty-three feet

long, and nearly five in diameter; and those
which form the roof are still larger: in the
"inmost inclofures are the chapels. About

s 4 "half

'( half a mile to the East of Seringham, and
a nearer to thc Caveri than the Coleroon, is
' another large Pagoda, called Jembikifma; but
"this has only one inclofure. The extreme
c veneration in which Seringham is held,

arises from a belief that it contains that iden-
tical image of the god Wiftchnu, which used
to be worlhipped by the god Brahma. Pil-

" grims from all parts of the peninsula come here
" to obtain aboilution, and none come without
' an offering of money; and a large part of
" the revenue of the island is allotted for the
" maintcnance of the Brahmins who inhabit
"the Pagoda; and these, with their families,
a formerly compostd a multitude not less than
't forty thousand fouls, maintained, without la-

bour, by the liberality of superstition. Here,

"c as in all the other great Pagodas of India,
' the Brahmins live in a subordination which

knows no resistance, and number in a vo,
« luptuoufies which knows no wantsk."

THE other species of public buildings which

I mentioned, were thofc erected for the defence
of the country. From the immense plains of
Indoltan there arise, in different parts, emi.

pences and rocks formed by nature to be places
of (Irength. Of ltefe the natives early took
ptlfsion, and fortifying them with works of
various kinds, rendered them almoff impreg-
nable Rations. There seems to have been, in
fonme distant age, a period of general turbu-
lerce and danger in India, when such retreats
were deemed essentially necessary to public safety;
for amcng the duties of magillrates prescribed
by the Pundis, one is, " that he shall erect a
t firong fort in the place where he chufes to
" re ide; and fhaii build a wall on all the four
" fides of it, with towtrs and battlements, and

fh:;l make a full ditch around it'." Of there

fortleffes several remain, which, both from the
appearance of the buildings and from the tra-
dition of the natives, muit have been con-
Ltruted in very remote times. Mr. Hodges
has publilhed views of three of these, one of
Chunar Gur, situated upon the river Ganges,
about sixteen miles above the city of Benaresm;
the second, of Gwallior, about eighty miles
to the south of Agra'" the third of Bidjegur,
in the territory of Benares . They are all,
particularly Gaallior, works of considerable
magnitude and,ftrength. The fortresses in Ben-

gal, however, are not to be compared with fe.
veral in the Deccan. AfTeergur, Burhampour,
and Dowlatabad, are deemed by the natives
to be impregnableP; and I am assured, by a
good judge, that Affeergur is indeed a most
stupendous work, and so advantageously fitua-
ted, that it would be extremely difficult to re-
duce it by force. Adoni, of which Tippoo
Sultaun lately rendered himself master, is not
inferior to any of them, either in strength or
importance 9.

NoR is it only from surveying their public

works that we are justified in alerting the early
proficiency of the Indians in elegant and useful
arts: we are led to form the fame conclusion by a
vicw of those produtions of their ingenuity,
which were the chief articles of their trade
with foreign nations. Of these the labours of
the Indian loom and needle have, in every age,
been the most celebrated; and fine linen is con-
jectured, with some probability, to have been
called by the ancients Sindon, from the name
of the river Indus or Sindus, near which it was
wrought in the highest perfection'. The cot-

ton manufactures of India seem anciently to
have been as much admired as they are at pre-
sent, not only for their delicate texture, but
for the elegance with which some of them are
embroidered, and the beautiful colour of the
flowers with which others are adorned. From
the earliest period of European intercourse with
India, that country has been distinguished for
the number and excellence of the substances
for dying various colours, with which it abound-
ed'. The dye of the deep blue colour in
highest estimation among the Roinans bore
the name of Indicum'. From India too, the
the substance used in dying a bright red colour,
seems to have been imported'; and it is well
known that both in the cotton and silk stuffs
which we now receive from India, the blue
and the red are the colours of most conspicuous
lustre and beauty. But however much the
ancients may have admired these produtions
of Indian art, some circumitances, which I have
already mentioned, rendered their demand for
the cotton manufacures of India, far inferior
to that of modern timesi and this has occasioned

the information concerning them which we
receive from the Greek and Roman writers to
be very imperrfcc. We may conclude, how,
ever, from the wonderful resemblance of the
ancient Srate of India to the modern, that, in
every period, the productions of their looms
were as various as beautiful. The ingenuity
of the Indians in other kinds of workmanship,
particul:rly in metals and in ivory, is men-
tioned with praise by ancient authors, but with-
out any particular description of their nature .
Of thcfe early producions of Indian artists,
there are now some specimens in Europe,
from which it appears that they were acquainted
with the method of engraving upon the hardest
stones and gems; and, both in the elegance of
their designs and in neatness of execution, had
arrived at a considerable degree of excellence.
An ingenious writer maintains, that the art of
engraving on gems was probably an Indian
invention, and certainly was early improved
there, and he supports this opinion by several
plausible arguments'. The Indian engraved
gems, of which he has published descriptions,
appear to be the workmanship of a very remote

period, as the legends on them are in the Sans-
kreet language z.

BUT it is not alone from the improved state

of mechanic arts in India, that we conclude its
inhabitants to have been highly civilized; a
proof of this, till more convincing, may be
deduced from the early and extraordinary pro-
dutions of their genius in the fine arts. This
evidence is rendered more interesting, by being
derived from a source of knowledge which the
laudable curiosity of our countrymen has opened
to the people of Europe within these few years.
That all the science and literature possessld by
the Brahmins, were contained in books written
in a language, underitood by a few only of the
most learned among them, is a fact which has
long been known; and all the Europeans set-
tled in India d'.ring three centuries, have com-
plained that the Brahmins obitinately refused
to inftruc any person in this language. But
at length, by address, mild treatment, and a per-
suasion, that the earneftrels with which instruction
was solicited, proceeded not from any intention
of turning their religion into derision, but from
a desire of acquiring a perfect knowledge of
thier sciences and literature, the scruples of

the Brahmins have been overcome. Several
Britilh gentlemen are now completely masters
of the Sanfkreet language. The mysterious
veil, formerly deemed impenetrable, is removed;
and, in the course of five years, the curiosity
of the public has been gratified by two pub-
lications as singular as they were unexpected.
The one is a translation, by Mr. Wilkins, of an
Episode from the Mababarat, an Epic poem, in
high estimation among the Hindoos, com-
posed, according to their account, by Kreefhna
Dwypayen Veias, the most eminent of all their
Brahmins, above three thousand years before
the Christian era. The other is Sacontala, a
dramatic poem, written about a century before
the birth of Christ, translated by Sir William
Jones. I shall endeavour to give my readers
such a view of the subjec and composition of
each of these, as may enable them to estimate,
in some measure, the degree of merit which
they possess.

THE Mahabarat is a voluminous poem, con-

sifting of upwards of four hundred thousand
lines. Mr. Wilkins has translated more than a
third of it; but only a fliort episode, intitled
Baghvat-Geeta, is hitherto published, and from
this specimen we must form an opinion with
refpet to the whole. The subjec of the poem
is a famous civil war between two branches of

the

the royal house of Bhaurat. When the forces
on each fide were formed in the field, and
ready to decide the contest by the sword, Arjoon,
the favourite and pupil of the god Kreefhna,
who accompanied him in this hour of danger,
requested of him to cause his chariot to advance
between the two hostile armies. He looked
at both armies, and beheld, on either fide, none
but grandsires, uncles, coufihs, tutors, sons,
and brothers, near relations or bosom friends;
and when he had gazed for a while, and saw
these prepared for the fight, he was seized with
extreme pity and compunction, and uttered his
sorrow in the following words:-" Having be-

held, 0 Kreejhna! my kindred thus waiting
anxious for the fight, my members fail me,

" my countenance withereth, the hair flandeth
" an end upon my body, and all my frame
"trembleth with horrori Even Gandeev, my
" bow, efcapeth from my hand, and my 1kin
: is parched and dried up.-When I have de-

stroyed my kindred, shall I longer look for
happincfs ? I wilt not for victory, Kreejhna

" I want not dominion; I want not pleasure;
" for what is dominion and the enjoyments of
"life, or even life itself, when those for whom
, dominion, pleasure, and enjoyment were to

be coveted, have abandoned life and fortune,
and stand here in the siel. ready for the

"battle.

'C battle. Tutors, sons, .I:id fathers, grandsires
"and grandsons, uncles, nephews, cousins, kin-

dred, and friends! Although they would

" kil me, I wih not to fight them; no not
" even for the dominion of the three regions

of the u.iverfe, much lets for this little earth'."

In order to remove his f-ruples, Krtefhna in-
forms him what was the duty of a prince of the
Chehteree, or military cast, when called to a&
in such a Situation, anl incites him to perform
it by a variety of moral and philosophical ar-
guments, the nature of which I shall have oc-
cafion to confider particularly in another part
of this Differration. In this dialogue between
Kreefhna and his pupil, there are several pas-
fages which give an high idea of the genius
of the poet. The speech of Arjoon I have
quoted, in which he expresses the anguilh
of his foul, must have fiuick every reader
as beautiful and pathetic; and I shall afterwards
produce a description of the Supreme Being,
and of the reverence vherewith he mhould be
worlhipped, which is sublime. But while there
excite our admiration, and confirm us in the
belief of a high degree of civilization in that
country where such a work was produced,
we are surprised at the defect of taste and of

art

art in the manner of introducing this Episode.
Two powerful armies are drawn up in battle-
array, eager for the fight a young hero and his
inftru&or are described as standing in a chariot of
war between them; that surely was not the
moment for teaching him the principles of phi-
lofophy, and delivering eighteen lectures of
metaphysics and theology.

WITH regard, however, both to the dramatic

and epic poetry of the Hindoos, we labour
under the disadvantage of being obliged to form
an opinion from a single specimen of each, and
that of the latter, too, (as it is only a part of
a large work,) an imperfe& one. But if, from
such scanty materials, we may venture upon
any decision, it muff be, that of the two, the
drama seems to have been conduAed with the
most correct taste. This will appear from
the observations which I now proceed to make
upon Sacontala.

IT is only to nations considerably advanced

in refinement, that the drama is a favourite en-
tertainment. The Greeks had been for a good
time a polished people; Alcmeus and Sappho had
compored their Odes, and Thales and Anaximan-
derhad opened their schools, beforeTragedy made
its first rude essay in the cart of Thespis and a

Tr good

good time elapsed before it attained to arr
considerable degree of excellence. From the
drama of Sacontala, then, we mufl form an ad-
vantageous idea of the slate of improvement
in that society to whose taste it was suited. In
estimating its merit, however, we must not
apply to it rules of criticifin drawn from the
literature and taste of nations with which its
author was altogether unacquainted; vwe muit
not expect the unities of the Greek theatre;
we must not meafire it by our own standard of
propriety. Allowance must be made for local
customs, and singular manners, arising from a
state of domestic f)ciety, an order of civil po-
licy, and a system of religious opinions, very
different from those established in Europe. Sa-
contala is not a regular drama, but, like some
of the plays early exhibited on the Spanifi and
Ennglifh thea.res, is an hiltory in dialogue, un-
folding events which happened in different
places, and during a series of years. When
viewed1 in this light, the fable is in general well
arranged, many of the incidents are happily
chotfen, and the vicifitudes in the situation (i
the principal personages are sudden and unex-
pete d. The unravelling of the piece, how-
ever, thollgh some of the circumstances prepa-
ratory to it be introduced with skill, is at last
broc:ght about by the intervention of superior

beings,

beings, which has always a bad effect, and dif-
covers some want of art. But as Sacontala was
(efcended of a celestial nymph, and under the
protection of a holy hermit, this heavenly inter-
position may appear less marvellous, and is
extremely agreeable to the Oriental taste. In
many places of this drama it is simple and ten-
der, in lome pathetic; in others there is a mix-
ture of comic with what is more serious. Of
each, examples might be given. I shall felecc
a few of the first, both because simplicity and
tenderness are the characteriffic beauties of the
piece, and becaule they ib little resemble the
extravagant imagery and turgid style confpi-
cuous in almost all the specimens of Oriental
poetry which have hitherto been published.

SACONTALA, the heroine of the drama, a

a princcls of high birth, had been educated by
an holy hermit in a hallowed grove, and had
palled the early part of her life in rural oc-
cupations and paltoral innocence. When Ihe
was about to quit this beloved retreat, and
repair to the court of a great monarch, to whom
fie had been married, Cana, her fofter-father,
and her youthful cormpaiiion,, thus bewail their
own lo1s, and express their wilies for her hap-
pinels, in a strain of fentinient and language per-
fctlv fi:ited to their pastoral charaCter.

Dramatic exhibitions seem to have been a fa-
vourite amusement of the Hindoos as well as of
other civilized nations. "I The tragedies, co-
, medies, farces, and musical pieces of the In-
( dian theatre, would fill as many volumes as
, that of any nation in ancient or modern Eu-
"rope. They are all in verse where the dia-
, logue is elevated, and in prose where it is

V. THE attainments of the Indians in science,

furnish an additional proof of their early civiliza-
tion. By every person who has visited India
in ancient or modern times, its inhabitants, ei-
ther in transaCtions of private business, or in
the conduct of political affairs, have been deemed
not inferior to the people of any nation in fa-
gacity or in acuteness of underltanding. From

the application of such talents to the cultivation
of science, an extraordinary degree of proficiency
might have been expected. The Indians were,
accordingly, early celebrated on that account,
and some of the most eminent of the Greek
philosophers travelled into India, that, by con-
versing with the fages of that country, they
might acquire some portion of the knowledge
for which they were diftinguiflecd'. The ac-
counts, however, which we receive from the
Greeks and Romans, of the sciences which
attracted the attention of the Indian philosophers,
or of the discoveries which they had made in
them, are very imperfect. To the researches of
a few intelligent persons, who have visited India
during the course of the three last centuries, we are
indebted for more ample and authentic information.
But from the reluctance with which the Brah-
mins communicate their sciences to strangers,
and the inability of Europeans to acquire
much knowledge of them, while, like the myf-
teries of their religion, they were concealed from
vulgar eyes in an unknown tongue, this inform-
ation was acquired slowly and with great
difficulty. The fame observation, however,

India,

India, is applicable to that of their progress in
science, and the present age is the firit furnished
with sufficient evidence upon which to found
a decisive judgment with refpet to either.

SCIENCE, when viewed as disjoined from re-

ligion, the consideration of which I reserve for
another head, is employed in contemplating
either the operations of the underifanding, the
exercise of our moral powers, or the nature
and qualities of external objecs. The first is
denominated logic; the second ethics ; the third
physics, or the knowledge of nature. With
refpe& to the early progress in cultivating each
of these sciences in India, we are in pofffcfion of
fasts which merit attention,

BUT, prior to the consideration of them, it

is proper to examine the ideas of the Brahmins
with respect to mind itself, for if these were not
just, all their theories concerning its operations
muff have been erroneous and fanciful. The
diftinEtion between matter and spirit appears
to have been early known by the philosophers
of India, and to the latter they ascribed many
powers of which they deemed the former to
be incapable; and when we recollec how in-
adequate our conceptions are of every ob;e6t
that does not fall under the cognizance of the

ot its n-rurc than that given by the author of
the Mahabarat. " Some," fays he, c" regard the

" for iisindi;.:iible, inco mb, icomab, incorruptible;

it is eternal, univei-:il, permanent, immovable;
, it is invisible, inconccivable, and unalter-

able '." After this view of the fentirnents

of the Brahmins concerning mind itself, we may
proceed to confider their ideas with respect to
each of the sciences, in that tripartite arrange-
nmlnt which I mentioned.

form arrangements of science. The philo-
fophers of ancient Greece were highly celebrated
f(r their proficiency in these abltrufe Ipecula-
tions; and in their difcuflRons and arrangements,
discovered such deptl of thought, and acute-
ncfs of discernment, that their fyflems of Logic
particularly that of the Peripatetick School,
have been deemed most dtiinguiifhed efforts of
human reason.

BUT since we became acquainted, in some

degree, with the literature and science of the
llindoos, we find that as loon as men arrive
at that itage in locial life, when they can turn
their attention to fpecuiative inquiries, the hu-
man mindl ill, in every region of the earth,

similar iteps. From Abul Fazel's compendium

m:rny paitiges in the Baghiat-Geera, it appears
that the fame fpecularions which occupied the
p hiofophe-s of Greece had engaged the attention
of the Indian Brahmins; and the theories of
the fcrmrer, either concerning the qualities of
external objects, or the nature of our own ideas,
were not more ingenious than those of the latter.
To dfine with accuracy, to distinguish with
acuteness, and to reason with subtlety, are cha-
racteriftics of both; and in both, the fame ex-
ccfs of refinement, in attempting to analyse those
operations of mind which the faculties of man
were nor formed to comprehend, led Sometimes
to the most false and dangerous conclusions.
That sceptical philosophy, which denies the
exiflence of the material world, and aflerts no-
thing to be real but our own ideas, seems to
have been known in India as well as in Europe';
and the fages of the East, as they were indebted
to F:;i;oiophly for the knowledge of many im-
purrtnt truths, were not more exempt than
thole of the Weft from its dclufions and errors.

the conduct of life, as it is of all other the most
interesting, seems to have deeply engaged the
attention of the Brahmins. Their sentiments
with refpe& to these points were various, and,
like the philosophers of Greece, the Brahmins
were divided into feds, diltinguifhed by maxims
and tenets often diametrically opposite. That
feEt with whose opinions we are, fortunately,
best acquainted, had eftablifled a system of
morals, founded on principles the most generous
and dignified which unassisted reason is capable
of dilcovering. Man, they taught, was formed,
not for speculation or indolence, but for action.
He is born, not for himself alone, but for his fel-
low men. The happiness of the society of which
he is a member, the good of mankind, are his
ultimate and highest objects. In chufing what
to prefer or to rcject, the juflines and propriety
of his own choice are the only considerations to
which he flould attend. Tihe events which
may follow his actions are not in his own power,
and whether they be prosperous or adverse, as
long as he is f:tisled with the pturity of the
motives which induced him to a;, he can enjoy
that approbation of his own mind, which con-
ftitutes genuine happinels, independent of the
power of fortune or the opinions of other men.

FROM these, and other passages which I might

have quoted, we learn that the diftinguifling
doctrines of the Stoical School were taught
in India many ages before the birth of Zeno,
and inculcated with a persuasive earneftncfs
nearly resembling that of EpiEtetus; and it
is not without astonishment that we find the
tenets of this manly active phil)fophy, which
ieem to be formed only for men of the imoR

to a race of people'more eminent (as is generally

depending upon it have attained a superior de-
gree of perfection. Such improvement of this
science we find in India. While, among the
Greeks and Romans, the only method used for
the notation of numbers was by the letters of
the alphabet, which necessarily rendered arith-
metical calculation extremely tedious and ope-
rose, the Indians had, from time immemorial,
employed for the fame purpose the ten cyphers,
or figures, now universally known, and by means
of them performed every operation in arithmetic
with the greatest facility and expedition. By
the happy invention ot giving a different value
to each figure according to its change of place,
no more than ten figures are needed in calcula-
tions the most complex, and of any given extent;
and arithmetic is the most perfect of all the
sciences. The Arabians, not long after their
settlement in Spain, introduced this mode of
notation into Europe, and were candid enough
to acknowledge that they had derived the know-
ledge of it from the Indians. Though the ad-
vantages of this mode of notation are obvious
and great, yet so slowly do mankind adopt
new inventions, that the use of it was for some
time confined to science; by degrees, however,
men of business relinquifled the former cum-
berfome method of computation by letters, and

the

the :!dian arithmetic came into general use
throutl.out Europe ". It is now so familiar and
simple, that the ingenuity of the people, to whom
we are indebted for the invention, is less ob-
served and less celebrated than it merits.

THE astronomy of the Indians is a proof

still more conspicuous of their extraordinary
progress in science. The attention and success
with which they studied the motions of the
heavenly bodies were so little known to the
Greeks and Romans, that it is hardly mentioned
by them but in the most cursory manner ". But
as soon as the Mahomedans established an in-
tercourfe with the natives of India, they ob-
served and celebrated the superiority of their
astronomical knowledge. Of the Europeans
who visited India after the communication with
it by the Cape of Good Hope was discovered,
M. Bernier, an inquisitive and philosophical
traveller, was one of the first who learned that
the Indians had long applied to the study of
astronomy, and had made considerable progress
in that science°. His information, however,
seems to have been very general and imperfect.

We are indebted for the first scientific proof
of the great proficiency of the Indians in aftro-
nomical knowledge, to M. de la Loubere, who,
A. D. 16S. on his return from his embassy to Siam, brought

with him an extract from a Siamese manuscript,
which contained tables and rules for calculating
the places of the fun and moon. The manner
in which these tables were constructed rendered
the principles on which they were founded
extremely obscure, and it required a commenta-
tor as conversant in aitronomical calculation as
the celebrated Caflini, to explain the meaning
of this curious fragment. The epoch of the
Siamese tables corresponds to the 21if of March,
A.D. 63S. Another set of tables was tranf-
mirted from Chrifnabouram, in the Carnatic,
the epoch of which anfwcrs to the loth of
March, A. D. 1491. A third fct of tables came
from Narfapour, and the epoch of them goes
no farther back than A. D. 1569. The fourth
and most curious set of tables was publilhcd
by M. le Gentil, to whom they were communi-
cated by a learned Brahmin of Tirvalore, a
small town on the Coromandel coast, about
twclve miles weft of Negapatam. The
epoch of there tables is of high ahtiquity, and
coin.cides with the beginning of the celebrated
·ra of the Calyougham or Collee Joguc, which
commenced, according to the Indian account,

4 tljic

three thousand one hundred and two years
before the birth of Christ'.

THESE four sets of tables have been examined
and compared by M. Bailly, who with singular
felicity of genius has conjoined an uncommon
degree of eloquence with the patient researches
of an astronomer, and the profound investigations
of a geometrician. His calculations have been
verified, and his reasonings have been illus-
trated and extended by Mr. Playfair, in a very
masterly Dissertation, published in the Tranf-
ations of the Royal Society of Edinburghq.

INSTEAD of attempting to follow them in
reasonings and calculations, which, from their
nature, are often abstruse and intricate, I Ihall
satisfy myself with giving such a general view
of them as is suited to a popular work. This,
I hope, may convey a proper idea of what has
been published concerning the astronomy of
India, a subjea too curious and important to
be omitted in any account of the state of science
in that country; and, without interposing any
judgment of my own, I shall leave each of my
readers to form his own opinion.

U 2 IT

IT may be confidered as the general result of

all the inquiries, reasonings, and calculations,
with refpcc: to Indian astronomy, which have
hitherto been made public, " That the motion

of the heavenly bodies, and more particularly

" their ituation at the commencement of the
' different epochs to which the four sets of
" tables refer, are ascertained with great accu-
" racy; and that many of the elements of their
" calculations, efbecially for very remote ages,
" are vcrified by an aftonifling coincidence
( with the tables of the modern astronomy of
'c Europe, when improved by the latest and
cc molt nice dcductions from the theory of gra-
C' vitation." The e conclusions are rendered
peculiarly interesting, by the evidence which
they afford of an advancement in science un-
exampled in the history of rude nations. The
Indian Brahmins, who annually circulate a kind
of almanack, containing astronomical predictions
of some of the more remarkable phenomenan
the heavens, such as the-new and full moons,
the cclipfes of the fun and moon, are in pof-
felfion of certain methods of calculation, which,
upon examination, are found to involve in them
a very extenlive system of astronomical know-
lkdge. M. le Gentil, a French aflronomer,
had an opportunity, while in India, ofobferving

two
I

two eclipses of the moon which had been cal-
culated by a Brahmin, and he found the error
in either to be very inconsiderable.

THE accuracyofthefe results is less surprising

than the justness and scientific nature of the prin-
ciples on which the tables, by which they cal-
culate, are conftruated. For the method of
predicting eclipses which is followed by the
Brahmins, is of a kind altogether different from
any that has been found in the poffefllon of rude
nations in the infancy ofafironomy. In Chaldxa,
and even in Greece, in the early ages, the me-
thod of calculating eclipses was founded on the
observation of a certain period or cycle, after
which the eclipfcs of the fun and moon return
nearly in the ifme order; but there was no
attempt to analyfc the different circumstances on
which the eclipse depends, or to deduce its phe-
nomena from a precise knowledge of tie motions
of the fun and moon. This aIit was reserved for
a more advanced period, when geometry, as well
as arithmetic, were called in to the assistance of
astronomy, and if it was attempted at all, seems
not to have been attempted with success before
the age of Hipparchus. It is a method of this
superior kind, founded on principles and on
an analysis of the motions of the fun and moon,
which guides the calculations of ihe Bri.hmins,

u 3 and

and they never employ any of the grofier eftima-
tions, which were the pride of the first aftrono.
mers in Egypt and Chaldea.

THE Brahmins of the present times are guided

in their calculations by these principles, though
they do not now understand them; they know
only the use of the tables which are in their
possession, but are unacquainted with the me-
thod of their conftrution. The Brahmin who
visited M. le Gentil at Pondicherry, and in-
ftructed him in the use of the Indian tables,
had no knowledge of the principles of his art,
and discovered no curiosity concerning the
nature of M. le Gentil's observations, or about
the instruments which he employed. He was
equally ignorant with respect to the authors of
these tables; and whatever is to be learnt
concerning the time or place of their con-
ftrultion, muit be deduced from the tables them-
felvts. One set of these tables (as was formerly
observed) profess to be as old as the beginning
of the Calyougham, or to go back to the year
3102 before the Christian era; but as nothing
(it may be supposed) is easier than for an aftro-
nomer to give to his tables what date he pleases,
and, by calculating backwards, to establish an
epoch of any afligned antiquity, the preten-
sions of the Indian afrcnomy to so remote an

origin

origin are not to be admitted without exami-
nation.

THAT examination has accordingly been in-

ftituted by M. Bailly, and the result of his in-'
quiries is asserted to be, that the astronomy
of India is founded on observations which can-
not be of a much later date than the period
above mentioned. For the Indian tables re-
present the itate of the heavens at that period
with aftonilhing exaanefs; and there is be-
tween them and the calculations of our mo-
dern astronomy such a conformity, with rcfpec
to those ages, as could result from nothing, but
from the authors of the former having accurately
copied from nature, and having delineated truly
the face of the heavens, in the age wherein they
lived. In order to give some idea of the high
degree of accuracy in the Indian tables, I shall
felet a few instances of it, out of many that
might be produced. The place of the fun.for
the aitronomical epoch at the beginning of
the Calyougham, as fated in the tables of Tir.
valore, is only forty-feven minutes greater than
by the tables of M. de la Caille, when cor-
re&ed by the calculations of M. de la Grange.
The place of the moon, in the fame tables,
for the fame epoch, is only thirty-feven mi-
nutes different from the tables of Mayer. The

4 tables

tables of Ptolemy, for that epoch, are erroneous
no less than ten degrees with refpecl to the
place of the fun, and eleven degrees with re-
spect to that of the moon. The acceleration
of the moon's motion, reckoning from the
beginning of the Calyougham to the present,
time, agrees, in the Indian tables, with those
of Mayer to a single minute. The inequality
of the fun's motion, and the obliquity of the
ecliptic, which were both greater in former
ages than they are now, as rcpr-cfented in the
tables of Tirvalore, are almolf of the precise
quantity that the theory of gravitation aifigns
to them three thousand years before the Chris-
tian ara. It is accordingly for those very re-
mote agcs (about 5ooo years distant from the
present) that their astronomy is most accu-
rate, and the nearer we come down to
our ovwn times, the conformity of its results
with ours diminishes. It seems reasonable to
suppose, that the time when its rules are most
accurate, is the time when the observations were
made on which these rules are founded,

IN support of this conclusion, M. Bailly main,

tains that none of all the astronomical systems
of Greece or Persia, or of Tartary, from some
of which it might be suspected that the Indian
tabl!s were copied, can be made to agree with

them,

them, especially when we calculate for very
remote ages. The superior perfection of the
Indian tables becomes always more conspicuous
as we go farther back into antiquity. This
Ihews, likewise, how difficult it is to construct
any astronomical tables, which will agree with
the state of the heavens for a period so remote
from the time when the tables were confiruaed,
as four or five thousand years. It is only from
astronomy in its most advanced state, such as
it has attained in modern Europe, that such
accuracy is to be expe&ed.

WHEN an estimate is endeavoured to be

made of the geometrical skill necessary for the
conftrution of the Indian tables and rules, it is
found to be very considerable; and, betide the
knowledge of elementary geometry, it must
have required plain and spherical trigonometry,
or something equivalent to them, together with
certain methods of approximating to the values
of geometrical magnitudes, which seem to rife
very far above the elements of any of those
sciences. Some of these last mark also very
clearly (although this has not been observed by
I. Baiily) that the places to which these tables
are adapted, must be situated between the Tro-
pics, because they are altogether inapplicable at
a greater distance from the Equator.

FROM

FROMt this long induction, the conclusion

which seems obviously to result is, that the In-
dian astronomy is founded upon observations
which were made at a very early period; and
when we confider the exact agreement of the
places which they assign to the fun and moon,
and other heavenly bodies, at that epoch, with
those deduced from the tables of De la Caille
and Mayer, it strongly confirms the truth of
the position which I have been endeavouring
to establish, concerning the early and high state
of civilization in India.

BEFORE I quit this subjet, there is one cir-

cumftance which merits particular attention.
All the knowledge which we have hitherto
acquired of the principles and conclusions of
Indian astronomy is derived from the southern
part of the Carnatic, and the tables are adapted
to places situated between the meridian of Cape
Comorin and that which passes through the
c2ftern part of Ceylonr. The Brahmins in the
Carnatic acknowledge that their science of
aitronomy was derived from the North, and that
their method of calculation is denominated Fa-
kiam, or New, to distinguish it from the Sid-
dantam, or ancient method established at Benares,

Bailly, Dif. Prelim. p. xvii.

which

which they allow to be much more perfe&t;
and we learn from Abul Fazel, that all the
astronomers of Indoftan rely entirely upon the
precepts contained in a book called Soore Sud-
hant, composed in a very remote period'. It
is manifestly from this book that the method
to which the Brahmins of the South gave the
name of Siddantam is taken. Benares has been
from time immemorial the Athens of India, the
residence of the most learned Brahmins, and the
feat both of science and literature. There, it
is highly probable, whatever remains of the
ancient aitronomical knowledge and discoveries
of the Brahmins is still preserved'. In an en-
lightened age and nation, and during a reign
distinguished by a fjcceffion of the most fplen-
did and successful undertakings to extend the
knowledge of nature, it is an object worthy or
public attention, to take measures for obtaining
possession of all that time has spared of the
philosophy and inventions of the most early and
most highly civilized people of the East. It is
with pecul;ar advantages Great Britain may
engage in this laudable undertaking. Benares
is subjet to its dominion; the confidence of

them communicative; some of our countrymen
are acquainted with that sacred language in which
the mysteries bothi of religion and of science are
recorded; movement and activity has been
given to a spirit of inquiry throughout all the
British lftablifhments in India; persons who
visited that country with other views, though
engaged in occupations of a very different kind,
are now carrying on scientific and literary re-
searches with ardour and fuccifs. Nothing
seems now to be wanting but that those en-
trusted with the administration of the British
empire in India, should enable some person,
capable, by his talents and liberality of sentiment,
of inveitigating and explaining the more abftrufc
parts of Indian philosophy, to devote his whole
time to that important object. Thus Great
Britain may have the glory of exploring fully
that extensive field of unknowvn science, which
the Academicians of France had the merit of
first opening to the people of Europe ".

inflitu-

institutions of religion, publicly established in
all the extensive countries stretching from the
Banks of the Indus to Cape Comorin, present
to view an aspec nearly similar. They form
a regular and complete fyfiem of superstition,
strengthened and upheld by every thing
which can excite the reverence and secure
the attachment of the people. The temples,
conficrated to their deities, are magnificent,
and adorned not only with rich offerings,
but with the most exquisite works in paint-
ing and sculpture which the artists, highest
in efimnation among them, were capable of
executing. The rites and ceremonies of their
worfiip are pompous and splendid, and the per-
formance of them not only mingles in all the
more momentous tranfations of common life,
but conftitttcs an essential part of them. The
Brahmins, who, as ministers of religion, preside
in all its functions, are elevated above every
other order of men, by an origin deemed not
only more noble, but acknowledged to be fa-
cred. They have established among themselves
a regular hierarchy and gradation of ranks,
which, by securing subordination in their own
order, adds weight to their authority, and gives
them a more absolute dominion over the minds
of the people. This dominion they support
by the command of the immense revenues with

which

which the liberality of princes, and the zeal
of pilgrims and devotees, have enriched their
Pagodas '.

IT is far from my intention to enter into any

minute detail with refpe& to this vast and cor-
plicated system of fuperftidon. An attempt
to enumerate the multitude of deities which
are the objets of adoration in India; to de-
scribe the splendour ofworihip in their Pagodas,
and the immense variety of their rites and ce-
remonies; to recount the various attributes and
functions which the craft of priests, or the cre-
dulity of the people, have ascribed to their di-
vinities ; especially if I were to accompany all
this with a review of the numerous and
often fanciful speculations and theories of
learned men on this fubje&, would require a
work of great magnitude. I shall, therefore,
on this, as on some of the former heads, confine
mycflf to the precise point which I have kept
uniformly in view, and by confidering the slate
of religion in India, I shall endeavour not only
to throw additional light on the state of civiliza-
tion in that country, but I flatter myself that, at
the fame time, I ihall be able to give what may
be confidered as a {ketch and outline of the

history

history and progress of superstition and falfc
religion in every region of the earth.

I. WE may observe, that, in every country,

the received mythology, or system of super-
ftitious belief, with all the rites and ceremonies
which it prescribes, is formed in the infancy
of society, in rude and barbarous times. True
religion is as different from superstition in its
origin, as in its nature. The former is the
offspring of reason cherished by science, and
attains to its highest perfetion in ages of light
and improvement. Ignorance and fear give
birth to the latter, and it is always in the darkest
periods that it acquires the greatest vigour.
That numerous part of the human species whose
lot is labour, whose principal and almost sole
occupation is to secure subsistence, has neither
leisure nor capacity for entering into that path
of intricate and refined speculation, which con-
du&s to the knowledge of the principles of
rational religion. When the intellectual powers
are just beginning to unfold, and their first feeble
exertions are directed towards a few objets of
primary necessity and use; when the faculties
of the mind are so limited as not to have formed
general and abftra& ideas; when language is
lb barren as to be dcftitute of names to distinguish

any

any thing not perceivable by some of the senses4
it is preposterous to expea that men ihould. be
capable of tracing the relation between effects
and their causes; or to suppose that they should
rife from the contemplation of the former to
the discovery of the latter, and form just con-
ceptions of one Supreme Being, as the Creator
and Governor of the universe. The idea of
creation is so familiar, wherever the mind is
enlarged by science, and illuminated by re-
velation, that we seldom reflet how prbfound
and abstruse the idea is, or confider what pro-
grefs man must have made in observation and
research, before he could arrive at any diftina
knowledge of this elementary principle in re-
ligion. But even in its rude state, the haman
mind, formed for religion, opens to the re-
ception of ideas, which are destined, when cor-
rcted and refined, to be the great source of
consolation amidst the calamities of life. Thefa
apprehensions, however, are originally indif-
tin&t and perplexed, and seem to be suggested
rather by the dread of impending evils, than
to flow from gratitude for bleflings received.
While nature holds on her course with uniform
and undisturbed regularity, men enjoy the be-
nefits resulting from it, without much inquiry
concerning its cause. But every deviation from

Il this

tlhis regular course rouses and astonishes them.
When they behold events to which they are
not accustomed, they search for the causes of
them with eager curiosity. Their understanding
is often unable to discover there, but imagina-
tion, a more forward and ardent faculty of the
mind, decides without hesitation. It ascribes
the extraordinary occurrences in nature to the
influence of invisible beings, and supposes the
thunder, the hurricane, and the earthquake, to
be the immediate effet of their agency. Alarmed
by these natural evils, and exposed, at the fame
time, to many dangers and difaftersi which are
unavoidable in the early and uncivilized state
of society, men have recourse for protection
to power superior to what is human, and the
firit rites or practices which bear any refem-
blance to ats of religion, have it for their ob-
ject to avert evils which they susser or dread".

II. As superstition and false religion take

their rife, in every country, from nearly the fame
sentiments and apprehensions, the invisible be-
ings, who are the first objects of veneration,

have every where a near resemblance. To
conceive an idea of one superintending mind,
capable of arranging and direting all the va-
rious operations of nature, seems to be an at-
tainment far beyond the powers of man in the
more early flages of his progress. His theories,
more suited to the limited sphere of his own
observation, are not so refined. He supposes
that there is a diftint cause of every remarkable
effe&, and ascribes to a separate power every
event which attra&s his attention, or excites
his terror. He fancies that it is the province
of one deity to point the lightning, and, with
an awful found, to hurl the irresistible thunder-
bolt at the head of the guilty; that another
rides in the whirlwind, and, at his pleasure,
raises or stills the tempest; that a third rules
over the ocean; that a fourth is the god of
battles; that, while malevolent powers scat-
ter the feeds of animosity and discord, and kindle
in the breast those angry passions which give
rife to war, and terminate in deftruftion, others,
of a nature more benign, by inspiring the hearts
of men with kindness and love, itrengthen the
bonds of social union, augment the happiness,
and increase the number of the human race.

WITHOUT descending farther into detail, or
attempting to enumerate that infinite multitude

of

of deities to which the fancy or the fears of
men have allotted the diretion of the several
departments in nature, we may recognise a
firiking uniformity of features in the systems
of superstition eftabliihed throughout every part
of the earth. The less men have advanced
beyond the state of savage life, and the more
lender their acquaintance with the operations
of nature, the fewer were their deities in num-
ber, and the more compendious was their theo-
logical creed; but as their mind gradually
opened, and their knowledge continued to ex-
tend, the objects of their veneration multiplied,
and the articles of their faith became more nu-
merous. This took place remarkably among
the Greeks in Europe, and the Indians in Asia,
the two people in those great divisions of the
earth, who were most early civilized, and to
whom, for that reason, I shall confine all my
observations. They believed, that over every
movement in the natural world, and over every
funtion in civil or domestic life, even the most
common and trivial, a particular deity presided.
The manner in which they arranged the fta-
tions of these fiiperintending powers, and the
offices which they allotted to each, were in
many refpeas the fame. What is supposed to
be performed by the power of Jupiter, of Nep-
tune, of 2Eolus, of Mars, of Venus, according
to the mythology of the Weft, is ascribed in the

x a East

East to the agency of Agnee, the god of fire;
Varoon, the god of oceans; Vayoo, the god
of wind ; Cama, the god of love; and a va-
riety of other divinities.

THE ignorance and credulity of men having

thus peopled the heavens with imaginary beings,
they ascribed to them such qualities and aftions
as they deemed suitable to their character and
functions. It is one of the benefits derived
from true religion, that by setting before men
a tfandard of perfct excellence, which they
should have always in their eye, and endeavour
to resemble, it may be said to bring down virtue
from heaven to earth, and to form the human
mind after a divine model. In fabricating sys-
tems of falle religion the procedure is diretly
the reverse. Men ascribe to the beings whom
they have deified, such actions as they them-
feivcs admire and celebrate. The qualities of
the gods vho are the objects of adoration, are
copied from those of the worshippers who bow
down before them; and thus many of the im-
perfctions peculiar to men, have found admit-
tance into heaven. By knowing the adven-
tures and attributes of any false deity, we can
pronounce, with fonie degree of certainty, what
muC have been the Rlate of fuciety and manners

when

when he was elevated to that dignity. The
mythology of Greece plainly indicates the cha-
raCter of the age in which it was formed. It
mutff have been in times of the greatelt licentious-
ness, anarchy, and violence, that divinities of
the highest rank could be supposed capable of
perpetrating aftions, or of being influenced by
pallions, which, in more enlightened periods,
would be deemed a disgrace to human nature;
it muff have been when the earth was fiill in-
fested with deftru&ive monsters, and mankind,
under forms of government too feeble to afford
them protection, were exposed to the depreda-
tions of lawlcfs robbers, or the cruelty of savage
oppressors, that the well-known labours of
Hercules, by which he was raised from earth
to heaven, could have been necessary, or would
have been deemed so highly meritorious. The
fame observation is applicable to the ancient
mythology of India. Many of the adventures
and exploits of the Indian deities are ifited to
the rudefl ages of turbulence and rapine. It
was to check disorder, to redress wrongs, and
to clear the earth of powerful oppressors, that
Viflnou, a divinity of the highelf order, is said
to have become fucceflively incarnate, and to
have appeared on earth in various forms'.

x 3 III. THE

III. THE character and funtions of those

deities which superstition created to itself as ob-
je&s of its veneration, having every where a near
resemblance, the rites of their worship were
every where extremely flmilar. Accordingly, as
deities were distinguished, either by ferocity of
characer or licentiousness of conduEt, it is ob-
vious what services must have been deemed most
acceptable to them. In order to conciliate the
favour, or to appease the wrath, of the former,
fasts, mortifications, and penances, all rigid, and
many of them excruciating to an extreme degree,
were the means employed. Their altars were
always bathed in blood, the most costly vitims
were offered, whole hecatombs were slaughtered,
even human sacrifices were not unknown, and
were held to be the most powerful expiations.
In order to gain the good-will of the deities of
the latter description, recourse was had to in-
ftitutions of a very different kind, to splendid
ceremonies, gay festivals, heightened by all the
pleasures of poetry, mufick, and dancing, but
often terminating in scenes of indulgence too
indecent to be described. Of both these, in-
stances occur in the rites of Greek and Roman
worship, which I need not mention to my learned
readers'. In the East the ceremonial of super..

flition

ftiion is nearly the fame. The manners of the
Indians, though distinguished, from the time
when they became known to the people of the
Weft, for mildness, seem, in a more remote
period, to have been in a greater degree similar
to those of other nations. Several of their
deities were fierce and awful in their nature,
and were represented in their temples under the
most terrific forms. If we did not know the
dominion of superstition over the human mind,
we should hardly bqlieve, that a ritual of worship
suited to the character of such deities could have
been eftablilhed among a gentle people. Every
at of religion, performed in honour of some
of their gods, seems to have been prescribed by
fear. Mortifications and penances, so rigorous,
so painful, and so long continued, that we read
the accounts of them with astonishment and
horror, were multiplied. Repugnant as it is
to the feelings of an Hindoo, to shed the blood
of any creature that has life, many different ani-
mals, even the most useful, the horse and the cow,
were offered up as vicims upon the altars of
some of their godsb; and what is fRill more
firange, the Pagodas of the East were polluted
with human sacrifices, as well as the temples of

remonies of a less severe kind, were more
adapted to the genius of a people, formed, by
the extreme sensibility both of their mental and
corporeal frame, to an immoderate love of pla-
sure. In no part of the earth was a connection
between the gratification of sensual desire and
the rites of public religion, difplnyed with more
avowed indecency than in India. In every Pa-
goda there was-a band of women set apart for
the service of the idol honoured there, and de-
voted from their early years to a life ofpleafure;
for which the Brahmins prepared them by an
education which added so many elegant accom-
plifhmcnts to their natural charms, that what
they gained by their profligacy, often brought
no inconsiderable acceflion to the revenue of the
temple. In every function performed in the
pagodas, as well as in every public procession,
it is the office of there women to dance before
the idol, and to ting hymns in his praise; and it
is difficult to fay, whether they trespass most
againlt decency by the gestures they exhibit,
or by the versts which they recite. The walls
of the Pagoda are covered with paintings, in

IV. How absurd soever the articles of faith

may be which fuiperftition has adopted, or how
unhallowed the rites which it prescribes, the
former are received in every age and country
with unhesitating afient, by the great body of
the people, and the latter observed with fcru-
pulous cxaanefs. In our reasonings concern-
ing religious opinions and practices which differ
widely from our own, we are extremely apt to
err. Having been inftruttcd ourselves in the
principles of a religion, worthy in every refpec
of that divine wisdom by which they were dic-
tated, we frequently express wonder at the cre-
dulity of nations in embracing systems of belief
which appear to us so directly repugnant to right
reason, and sometimes suspect that tenets so wild
and extravagant do not really gain credit with
them. But experience may satisfy us, that

neither

neither our wonder nor suspicions are well
founded. No article of the public religion was
called in question by those people of ancient
Europe with whose history we are belt acquainted,
and no pracice which it enjoined appeared im-
proper to them. On the other hand, every
opinion that tended to diinirih the reverence
of men for the gods of their country, or to
alienate them from their worihip, excited among
the Greeks and Romans, that indignant zeal
which is natural to every people attached to
their religion, by a firm persuasion of its truth.
The attachment of the Indians, both in ancient
and modern times, to the tenets and rites of
their ancestors, has been, if possible, ifill greater.
In no country, of which we have any account,
were precautions taken with so much solicitude,
to place the great body of the people beyond
the reach of any temptation to doubt or dif-
belief. They not only were prevented, (as I
have already observed the great bulk of man-
kind must always be in every country,) from
entering upon any speculative inquiry, by the
various occupations of active and laborious
life, but any attempt to extend the sphere of
their knowledge was expressly prohibited. If
one of the Sooder cast, by far the most numerous
of the four into which the whole nation was
divided, presumed to read any portion of the

sacred

sacred books, in which all the science known
in India is contained, he was severely punished;
if he ventured to get it by heart, he was put
to deathr. To aspire after any higher degree
of knowledge than the Brahmins have been
pleased to teach, would be deemed not only
presumption but impiety. Even the higher
Casts depended entirely for inftrution on the
Brahmins, and could acquire no portion of
science but what they deigned to communicate.
By means of this, a devout reverence was uni-
verfally maintained for those institutions which
were confidered as sacred; and, though the
faith of the Hindoos has been often tried by
severe persecutions, excited by the bigotry of
their Mahomedan conquerors, no people ever
adhered with greater fidelity to the tenets and
rites of their ancestors g.

V. WE may observe, that when science and

philosophy are diffused through any country,
the fyltem of fiperflition is fubjeted to a fcru-
tiny from which it was formerly exempt, and
opinions spread which imperceptibly diminish
its influence over the minds of men. A free
and full examination is always favourable to

truth,

truth, but fatal to error. What is received with
implicit faith in ages of darkness, will excite con-
tempt or indignation in an enlightened period.
The history of religion in Greece and Italy,
the only countries of Europe which, in ancient
times, were diftinguilhed for their attainments
in science, confirms the truth of this observation.
As soon as science made such progress in Greece
as rendered men capable of discerning the wis-
dom, the foresight, and the goodness displayed
in creating, preserving, and governing the world,
they mulf have perceived, that the characters
of the divinities which were proposed as the
objects of adoration in their temples, could not
entitle them to be confidered as the presiding
powers in nature. A poet might address Ju-
piter as the father of gods -and men, who go-
verned both by eternal laws; but, to a philofo-
pher, the son of Saturn, the story of whose life
is a series of violent and licentious deeds, which
would render any man odious or despicable,
muff have appeared altogether unworthy of
that station. The nature of the religious ser-
vice celebrated in their temples muff have been
no less offensive to an enlightened mind, than
the character of the deities in honour of whom
it was performed. Instead of inffitutions, tend-
ing to reclaim men from vice, to form or to
strengthen habits of virtue, or to elevate the

7 mind

mind to a sense of its proper dignity, super-
tition either occupied its votaries in frivolous
unmeaning ceremonies, or preferibed rites, which
operated, with fatal influence, in inflaming the
paflions and corrupting the heart.

IT is with timidity, however, and caution,

that men venture to attack the established re-
ligion of their country, or to impugn opinions
which have been long held sacred. At first,
some philosophers endeavoured, by allegorical
interpretations and refined comments, to ex-
plain the popular mythology, as if it had been
a description of the powers of nature, and of the
various events and revolutions which take place
in the system of the material world, and en-
deavoured, by this expedient, to palliate many
of its absurdities. By degrees, bolder theories
concerning religion were admitted into the
schools of science. Philosophers of enlarged
views, sensible of the impiety of the popular
superstition, formed ideas concerning the per-
sections of one Supreme Being, the Creator
and Ruler of the universe, as just and rational
as have ever been attained by the unaffifded
powers of the human mind.

IF from Europe we now turn to Aria, we
shall find, that the observation which I have

made

made upon the history of false religion holds
equally true there. In India as well as in Greece,
it was by cultivating science that men were
firfl led to examine and to entertain doubts with
refpeft to the established systems of fuperfticion
and when we confider the great difference be-
tween the ecclesiastical constitution (if I may
use that expression) of the two countries, we are
apt to imagine that the established system lay
more open to examination in the latter than in
the former. In Greece there was not any dif-
tin& race or order of men set apart for per-
forming the funcions of religion, or to serve
as hereditary and interested guardians of its
tenets and institutions. But in India the Brah-
mins were born the ministers of religion, and
they had an exclusive right of presiding in all
the numerous rites of worship which superstition
prescribed as necessary to avert the wrath of
Heaven, or to render it propitious. These
diftin&ions and privileges secured to them a
wonderful ascendant over their countrymen; and
every consideration that can influence the human
mind, the honour, the interest, the power of
their order, called upon them to support the
tenets, and to maintain the institutions and
rites, with which the preservation of this as-
cendant was so intimately connected.

BUT

BUT as the most eminent persons of the Cast

devoted their lives to the cultivation of science,
the progress which they made in all the branches
of it (of which I have given some account)
was great, and enabled them to form such a
just idea of the system of nature, and of the
power, wisdom and goodness displayed in the
formation and government of it, as elevated their
minds above the popular fuperflition, and led
them to acknowledge and reverence one Su-
preme Being, " the Creator of all things (to

use their own expressions), and from whom
all things proceed ."

THIS is the idea which Abul Fazel, who ex-

amined the opinions of the Brahmins with the
greatest attention and candour, gives of their
theology. " They all," fays he, " believe in

the unity of the Godhead, and although they
" hold images in high veneration, it is only

because they represent celestial beings, and

" prevent the thoughts of those who worship
" them from wandering'.' The sentiments
of the most intelligent Europeans who have
visited India, coincide perfectly with his, in re-
fpeEt to this point. The accounts which Mr.
Bernier received from the Pundits of Benares,

both of their external worship, and of one go.
vereign Lord bcing the sole object of their devo.
tion, is precifciy the fame with that given by Abut
Fazelk. Mr. Wilkins, better qualified perhaps
than any European ever was to judge with re-
spect to this fubjcct, rcprefents the learned Brah-
mins of the present times as Theists, believers
in the unity of God'. Of the fame opinion is
M. Sonnerat, who resided in- India seven years,
in order to inquire into the manners, sciences,
and religion of the Hindoos . The Pundits,
who translated the Code of Gentoo Laws, de-
clare, " that it w-as the Supreme Being, who,
" by his power, formed all creatures of the
" animal, vegetable, and material world, from
"the four elements of fire, water, air, and earth,
" to be an ornament to the magazine of creation;
" and whose comprehensive benevolence feleted
" man, the center of knowledge, to have do-
" minion and authority over the reft; and,
, having bestowed upon this favourite objeEt

judgment and understanding, gave him filpre-
" macy over the corners of the world "."

NOR are there to be regarded as refined fen-

timents of later times. The Brahmins being

confidered

tonfidcred by the Mahomedan conquerors of
India as the guardians of the national religion,
have been to studiously depressed by their
faratical zeal, that the modern members of that
order are as far inferior to their ancestors in
lcience as in power. It is from the writings
of their ancient Pundits that they derive the
most liberal sentiments which they entertain at
prctent, and the wisdom for which they are
now celebrated has been transmitted to them
from ages very remote.

THAT this assertion is well founded we are
enabled to pronounce with certainty, as the
must profound mysteries of Hindoo theology,
concealed with the greatest care from the body
of the people, have been unveiled by the tranf-
iations fiom the Sanfkreet language lately pub-
lifbed. The principal design of the Baghvat-
Geeta, an episode in the Mahabarat, a poem of
the highest antiquity, and of the greatest au-
thoritv in India, seems to have been to cftablilh
the docrine of the unity of the Godhead, and
fr,;m a just view of the divine nature, to deduce
an i.!ea of what worihip will be molt acceptable
to a perfecet Being. In it, amidst much obscure
metaphysical di!cuffion, some ornaments of
fancy unsuitc-d to our talte, and some thoughts
elevated to a tract of ftiblimity into wich, from

Y our

our habits of reasoning and judging, we will
find it difficult to follow them0, we find de-
scriptions of the Supreme Being entitled to
equal pr-ise with those of the Greek philosophers
which I have celebrated. Of these I shall now
produce one to which I formerly alluded, and
refer my readers for others to the work itself:

O might, Being," fays Arjoon, "who art
the prime Creator, eternal God of Gods, the
W orld's Mansion Thou art the incor-
ruptible Being, diftinc from all things tran-
fient. Thou art before all Gods, the ancient

" Pooreojh [i. e. vital foul], and the Supreme
" Supporter of the universe. Thou knoweft
, all thing, and art worthy to be known; thou

art the Supreme Mansion, and by thee, 0

" infinite Form, the universe was spread
· abroad !-Reverence be unto thee before and
" behind; reverence be unto thee on all fides;

0 thou wiho art all in all! Infinite is th)
power and thy glory.-Thou art the father
of all things, animate and inanimate. Thou
art the wife inftrutor of the whole, worthy
to be adored. There is none like unto thee;

· where, then, in the three worlds, is there one
i above thee ? Wherefore I bow down; and,

' with my body prostrate upon the ground, crave

Gceta, p. -

" thy

" thy mercy, Lord! worthy to be adored;
, for thou shouldest bear with me, even as a
, father with his son, a friend with his friend,
" a lover with his belovedP." A description
of the Supreme Being is given in one of the
sacred books of the Hindoos, from which it is
evident what were the general sentiments of
the learned Brahmins concerning the divine
nature and perfections: " As God is immaterial

he is above all conception; as he is invisible,

" he can have no form; but from what we
"behold of his works, we may conclude, that
' he is eternal, omnipotent, knowing all things,
"and present every where q."

To men capable of forming such ideas of the

Deity, the public service in the Pagodas must

the influence of his own order. His ideas con-
cerning the mode of worshipping the Deity, are
explained in many striking palfages of the poem;
but unwilling to multiply quotations, I satisfy
myflef with referring to them '.

WxVHEN we recollect how slowly the mind

of mnan opens to abstract ideas, and how
difficult (according to an observation in the
Mahabarat) an invisible path is to corporeal
-beings, it is evident that the Hindoos muff have
attained an high degree of improvement before
their sentiments rose so far superior to the po-
pular fuperfition of their country. The dif-
ferent states of Greece had subsisted long, and
had made considerable progress in refinement,
before the errors of fafre religion began to be
detected. It was not until the age of Socrates,
and in the schools of philosophy established by
his disciples, that principles adverse to the
tenets of the popular fuperfttion were much
propagated.

A LONGER period of time elapsed before the

Romans, a nation of warriors and statesmen,
were enlightened by science, or ventured upon
any free diquifition concerning the objects or

the

the rites of worship authorized by their ancef-
tors. But in India the happy effects of progress
in science were much more early conspicuous.
Without adopting the wild computations of
Indian chronology, according to which, the
Mahabarat was composed above four thousand
years ago, we muff allow, that it is a work of
very great antiquity, and the author of it discovers
an acquaintance with the principles of theology, of
morals, and ofmetaphyfics, morejuft and rational,
than seems to have been attained, at that period,
by any nation whose history is known.

BUT so unable are the limited powers of the
human mind to form an adequate idea of the
perfections and operations of the Supreme Being,
that in all the theories concerning them, of the
most eminent philosophers in the most en-
lightened nations, we find a lamentable mixture
of ignorance and error. From these the Brah-
mins were not more exempt than the fages of
other countries. As they held that the system
of nature was not only originally arranged by
the power and wisdom of God, but that every
event which happened was brought about by
his immediate interposition, and as they could
nqt comprehend how a being could at in any
place unless where it was present, they ftlppofed
the Deity to be a vivifying principle diffused

Y 3 through

through the whole creation, an universal foul
that animated each part of it'. Every intel-
ligent nature, particularly the fouls of men,
they copceived to be portions separated from
this great spirit , to which, after fulfilling their
destiny on earth, and attaining a proper degree
of purity, they would be again re-united. In
order to efface the stains with which a foul, during
its residence on earth, has been defiled, by the
indulgence of sensual and corrupt appetites, they
taught that it must paTs, in a long succession of
tranfinigrations, through the bodies of different
animals, until, by what it suffers and what it
learns in the various forms of its existence, it
O-all be so thoroughly refined from all pollution
as to be rendered meet for being absorbed into
the divine fcicnce, and returns like a drop intQ
that unbounded ocean from which it originally
iifued u. These doctrines of the Brahmins, con-
cerning the Deity, as the foul which pervades
all nature, giving activity and vigour to every
part of it, as well as the final re-union of all
intelligent creatures to their primaeval source,
coincide perfectly with the tenets of the Stoical

School. It is remarkable, that after having
obfirved a near resemblance in the most sublime
sentiments of their moral doctrine, we should
likewise discover such a similarity in the errors
of their theological speculations ".

THE human mind, however, when desfitute

of superior guidance, is apt to fall into a prac-
tical error with respect to religion, of a tendency
Rill more dangerous. When philosophers, by
their attainments in science, began to acquire
filchjuft ideas of the nature and perfections of
the Supreme Being, as convinced them that
the popular system of fuperRition was not only
absurd but impious, they were fully aware of all
the danger which might arise from communi-
cating what they had discovered to the people,
incapable of comprehending the force of those
reasons which had swayed with them, and so
zealously attached to established opinions, as to
revolt against any attempt to detect their falle-
hood. Instead, therefore, of allowing any ray of
that knowledge which illuminated their own
minds to reach them, they formed a theory to
justify their own conduct, and to prevent the
darkness of that cloud which hung over the
minds of their fellow-men from being ever dif-

pelled. The vulgar and unlearned, they
contended, had no right to truth. Doomed by
their condition to remain in ignorance, they
were to be kept in order by delusion, and allured
to do what is right, or deterred from venturing
upon what is wrong, by the hope of those ima-
ginary rewards which fuperfition promises, and
the dread of thole punishments which it threatens.
In confirmation of this, I might quote the doc-
trine of most of the philosophic secs, and pro-
duce the words of almost every eminent Greek
and Roman writer. It will be fifficient, how-
ever, to lay before my readers a remarkable pas-
sage in Strabo, to whom I have been so often
indebted in the course of my researches, and
who was no less qualified to judge with refped
to the political opinions of his contemporaries,
than to describe the countries which they in-
habited. " What is marvellous in fable, is em-
" ployed," fays he, " sometimes to please, and
(' sometimes to inspire terror, and both thefc
" are of use, not only with children, but with

persons of mature age. To children we pro-

" poe delightful fictions, in order to encourage
"them to at well, and such as are terrible,
" in ccr to restrain them from evil. Thus
" h

v. n mren are united in society, they are in-

" cittd to what is laudable, by hearing the poets
" ctkbrate the splendid actions of fabulous

"story,

f, ifory, such as the labours of Hercules and
, Theseus, in reward for which they are now
, honoured as divinities, or by beholding their
, illustrious deeds exhibited to public view in
- painting and sculpture. On the other hand,

they are deterred from vice, when the punish-

" ments inflited by the gods upon evil-doers
" are related, and threats are denounced against
" them in awful words, or represented by fright-
, ful figures, and when men believe that there

threats have been really executed upon the

( guilty. For it is impQOfible to conduct wo-
" men and the gross multitude, and to render

them holy, pious, and upright, by the pre-
cepts of reason and philosophy; superstition,
" or the fear of the gods, must be called in

aid, the influence of which is founded on

"fictions and prodigies. For the thunder of
, Jupiter, the aegis of Minerva, the trident of
"Neptune, the .orches and snakes of the furies,
t the spears of the gods, adorned with ivy, and
"the whole ancient theology, are all fables,

which the legislators who formed the political
constitution of states employ as bugbears to
" overawe the credulous and simple Y."

THESE ideas of the philosophers of Europe
were precisely the fame which the Brahmins

r Strabo, lib. i. p. 36. B.

had

had adopted in India, and according to which
they regulated their conduct with refpest to
the great body of the people. As their order
had an exclusive right to read the sacred books,
to cultivate and to reach science, they could
more effectually prevent all who were not mem-
bers of it from acquiring any portion of inform-
ation beyond -what they were pleated to impart.
When the free circulation of knowledge is not
circumscribed by such reftriclions, the whole
community derives benefit from every new ac-
quifition in science, the influence of which,
both upon sentiment and condut, extends in-
sensibly from the few to the many, from the
learned to the ignorant. But wherever the do-
minion of false religion is completely eflablithed,
the body of the people gain nothing by the
greatest improvements in knowledge. Their
philosophers conceal from them, with the utmost
solicitude, the truths which they have discovered,
and labour to fiupport that fabric of superstition
which it was their duty to have overturned.
They not only enjoin others to refped the re-
ligious rites prescribed by the laws of their
country, but conform to them in their own
pratice, and, with every external appearance
of reverence and devotion, bow down before
the altars of deities, who muff inwardly be the
objecs of their contempt. InRfead ofrefcmbling
the teachers of true religion in the benevolent

ardour

ardour with which they have always communi-
cated to their fellow-men the knowledge of
those important truths, with which their own
minds were enlightened and rendered happy,
the fages of Greece, and the Brahmins of India,
carried on with tfudied artifice, a scheme of
deceit, and, according to an emphatic expreflion
of an inspired writer, they detained the truth in
unrighteousness . They knew and approved
what was true, but among the reft of mankind
they laboured to support and to perpetuate
what is false.

THUS I have gone through all the particulars

which I originally proposed to examine, and
have endeavoured to dilcover the slate of the
inhabitants of India with refpea to each of them.
If I had aimed at nothing else than to describe
the civil policy, the arts, the sciences, and re-
ligious infiitutions of one of the most ancient
and most numerous race of men, that alone
would have led me into inquiries and discussions
both curious and inftrusive. I own, however,
that I have all along kept in view an objec
more interesting, as well as of greater import-
ance, and entertain hopes, that if the account

lization

lization of India, and of the wonderful progress
of its inhabitants in elegant arts and useful fci-
cnce, (hall be received asjuft and well eftablilhed,
it may have some influence upon the behaviour
of Europeans towards that people. Unfor-
tunately for the human Ipecies, in whatever
quarter of the globe the people of Europe have
acquired dominion, they have found the inhabit-
ants not only in a state of focicty and improve-
ment far inferior to their own, but different in
their complexion, and in all their habits of life.
Men in every ltage of their career are so satis-
sied with the progress made by the community
of which they are members, that it becomes
to them a standard of perfetion, and they are
apt to regard people, whose condition is not
similar, with contempt, and even aversion. In
Africa and America, the dissimilitude is tb con-
fpicuous, that, in the pride of their superiority,
Europeans thought themselves entitled to reduce
the natives of the former to slavery, and to ex-
terminate those of the latter. Even in India,
though far advanced beyond the two other
quarters of the globe in improvement, the co-
lour of the inhabitants, their effeminate ap-
pearance, their unwarlike spirit, the wild extrava-
gance of their religious tenets and ceremonies,
an m:ny other circumstances, confirmed Eu-
inv:.is.n in uch an opinion of their own pre-

eminence,

eminence, that they have always viewed and
treated them as an inferior race of men. Happy
would it be if any of the four European nations,
who have, successively, acquired extensive ter-
ritories and power in India, could altogether
vindicate itfelffrom having acted in this manner.
Nothing, however, can have a more direct and
powerful tendency to inspire Europeans, proud
of their own superior attainments in policy,
science, and arts, with proper sentiments con-
cerning the people of India, and to teach them
a due regard for their natural rights as men,
than their being accuffomed, not only to con-
fider the Hindoos of the present times as a
knowing and ingenious race of men, but to view
them as descended from ancestors who had
attained to a very high degree of improve-
ment, many ages before the least frep towards
civilization had been taken in any part of Eu-
rope. It was by an impartial and candid in-
quiry into their manners, that the Emperor
Akber was led to confider the --Iindoos as no
less entitled to protection and favour than his
other fubjests, and to govern them with such
equity and mildness, as to merit from a grateful
people the honourable appellation of " The
" Guardian of Mankind." It was from a thorough
knowledge of their character and acquirements,
that his Vizier Abul Fazel, with a liberality of

mind

mind unexampled among Mahomedans, pro-
nounces an high encomium on the virtues of
the Hindoos, both as individuals and as mem-
bers of society, and celebrates their attainments
in arts and sciences of every kind'. If I might
presume to hope that the description which I
have given of the manners and inifitutions of
the people of India could contribute in the
smallest degree, and with the most remote in-
fluence, to render their character more re-
fpeitable, and their condition more happy, I
thall close my literary labours with the fatisfa&ion
of thinking that I have not lived or written in
V.uin.

NOTE I. SEcT.I. p.8.
CREDULITY and scepticism are two opposite ex-

trcmes into which men are apt to run, in ex-

amining the events which are said to have happened
in the early ages of antiquity. Without incurring
any suspicion of a propensity to the latter of these, I
may be allowed to entertain doubts concerning the
expedition of Sefoftris into India, and his conquelt
of that country.---. Few faEts in ancient hiltory
seem to be better ealablifhed, than that of the early
aversion of the Egyptians to a sea-faring life. Even
the power of despotism cannot at once change the
ideas and manners of a nation, efpycially when they
have been confirmed by long habit, and rendered
sacred by the fandion of religion. That Sefoftris,
in the course of a few years, fliould have so entirely
overcome the prejudices of a superstitious people, as
to be able to fit out four hundred fiips of force

in

in the Arabian Gulf, besides another fleet which lle
had in the Mediterranean, appears to be extremely
improbable. Armaments of filch magnitude would
require the utmost efforts of a great and long eftabliflled
maritime power.- 2. It is remarkable that Hero-
dotus, who enquired with the most persevering dili-
gence into the ancient history of Egypt, and who re-
ceived all the information concerning it which the
prierts of Memphis, Heliopolis, and Thebes, could
communicate, Herodot. edit. Wefielingij, lib. ii. c. 3,
although he relates the history of Sefofiris at some
length, does not mention his conquest of India. Lib. ii.
c. i02, &c. That tale, it is probable, was invented
in the period between the age of H-erodotus and that
of Diodorus Siculus, from whom we receive a par-
ticular detail of the Indian expedition of Sefofiris.
His account refis entirely upon the authority of the
Egypt'i.;! priests; and Diodorus hinifelf not only
gives it as h.i general opinion, ' that many things

which they rciated, flowed vathtr from a defirc

oi;i oftria he hlid ftuiied to felec what appeared to him
i;.ft probable, and most agrec.ble to the monuments
of tha-t monarch flill remaining in Egypt, he has ad-
in::cd into his narrative many marvellous circum-
ft mces, which render the whole extremely suspicious.
'::c f ;:Icr ns ScfofTi.:, as he rclates, collected all the

male children who were born in Egypt on the fame
(!,y with his son, in order that they might be educated,
together with hini, conformable to a mode which he pre-
fIribed, with a view of preparing them as proper inftru-
inents to carry into execution the great undertakings
for which he destined Sefoftris. Accordingly, when
Scfoftris set out upon his Indian expedition, which,
from circumitances mentioned by Diodorus, must
have been about the fortieth year of his age, one thou-
sand seven hundred of his youthful associates are said
to have been still alive, and were entrusted with high
command in his army. But if we apply to the ex-
amination of this flory the certain principles of po-
litical arithmetic, it is evident, that if one thousand
seven hundred of the male children born on the fame
day with Sefoftris were alive when his great expedi-
tion commenced, the number of children born in
Egypt on each day of the year must have been at
least ten thousand, and the population of the kingdom
inuft have exceeded sixty millions; Goguet l'Origine

particular is the description of a ihip of cedar, four

Sefoftris consecrated to the dcity who was the chief

which, betide fix hundred thousand infantry, and

and other particulars appeared so far to exceed the
bounds of probability, that the found understanding
of Strabo the geographer rejected, without hefiration,
the accounts of the Indian expedition of Sefultris;

that this monarch never entered India, lib. xv. p. 1007.

\VWIEN we confider the extent and effects of the

Phenician commerce, the scanty information concern-
ing it which we receive from ancient writers must, on
a lirft view, appear surprising. But when we recol-
lect that all the Greek HIiftorians, (Herodotus ex-
cepted,) who give any account of the Phenicians, pub-
liflied their works long after the destruction of Tyre
by Alexander the Great, we will cease to wonder at
their not having entered into minute details with re-
spect to a trade which was then removed to new feats,
and carried on in other channels. But the power and
opulence of Tyre, in the prosperous age of its com-
merce, muff have attracted general attention. In the
prophecies of Ezekiel, who flourished two hundred
and sixty years before the fall of Tyre, there is the
most particular account of the nature and variety of its
commercial tranfaaions that is to be found in any
ancient writer, and which conveys, at the fame time,
a magnificent idea of the extensive power of that state.

THE account given of the revenue of the Perfiaa
monarchy by Herodotus is curious, and seems to have
been copied from some public record, which had been
communicated to him. According to it, the Persian
empire was divided into twenty satrapys, or govern-

minnts. The tribute levied from each is specified,
amounting in all to 14,560 Eubcean talents, which Dr.
Arbuthnot reckons to be equal to 2,807,4371. ftering
money i a fum extremely small for the revenue of the
Great King, and which ill accords with many faas
concerning the riches, magnificence, and luxury of the
East, that occur in ancient authors.

MAJOR RENNELI, in the second edition of his

Memoir, has traced, from very imperfe& materials,
the routes by which Alexander, Tamerlane, and Na-
dir Shah penetrated into India, with a degree of ac-
curacy which does honour to his discernment, and
displays the superiority of his knowledge in the an-
cient :nd modern geography of that country. Hiis
refearchcs he has illuitratcd by an additional map. To
these I must refer my readers. Nor are they to con-
fider his laborious inveftig-tion merely as an object
of curiosity; the geography of that fertile and extensive
region of India, diftinguified by the name of Pa.iab,
with which we are at present little acquainted, may
soon become very interefling. If, ,'m the one hand,
that firm foundation on which t ' British empire in
Ilnia seems to be eftabliflcd, by the successful termi-
nation of the late war, remains unfliaken ;-if, on the
other hand, the Seiks, a confederacy of fevcral inde-
pendent itates, flhill continue to extend their domi-
zuions with the fame rapidity that they have advanced
since the beginning of the current century;-it is highly
pr'.bble tlhat the c-.:c:?rizing commercial spirit of the

one

one people, and the martial ardour of the other, who
ffill retain the activity and ardour natural to men in
tile early stages of social union, may give rife to
events of the greatest moment. The frontiers of the
two states are approaching gradually nearer and nearer
to each other, the territories of the Seiks having
reached to the western bank of the river Jumnai,
while those of the Nabob of Oude itretch along its
eastern bank. This Nabob, the ally or tributary of the
Last India Company, is supported by a brigade of the
Bengal army, constantly stationed on his western fron-
tier. Ren. Memr. Introd. p.cxvi. In a position so con-
tiguous, rivalry for power, interference of interest, and
innumerable other causes of jealousy and discord, cal
hardly fail of terminating, sooner or later, in open hofti-

the principal part of Moultan, and the western part
of Delhi. The dimensions of this traa arc about
400 British miles from N. W. to S. E., varying in
breadth from 320 to 150 miles. Their capital city is
Lalore. Little is known concerning their govern-
ment and political maxims ; but they are represented
as mild. In their mode of making war, they arc

IT is surprising that Alexander did not receive, in
the provinces contiguous to India, such an account of

z 3 the

the periodical rains in that country, as to {hew him
the impropriety of carrying on military operations
there while these continued. His expedition into
India commenced towards the end of Spring, Arrian,
lib. iv. c. 22., *when the rains were already begun in
the mountains from which all the rivers in the Panjah
flow, and of course they must ha-e been considerably
swelled before he arrived on their banks. Rennell,
p. 268.-He palTed the Hydafpes at Midsummer,
about the height of the rainy season. In a country
through which so many large rivers run, an army on
service at this time of the year must have suffered
greatly. An accurate description of the nature of the
rains and inundations in this part of India, is given
by Arrian, lib. v. c. 9.; and one still fuller may be
found in Strabo, lib. xv. o103.-It was of what they
uffered by these that Alexander's soldiers complained,
Strabo, lib. xv. ICI2. D. ; and not without reason, as
it had rained incefrantly during seventy days, Diod.

accuracy with which Alexander's officers had attended
to every thing in that part of India, deserves notice.

talnrs, and in the country near to them, in the plains

Indus is generally clouded, but no rain falls, except
very near the sea. Indeed, very few flowers fall
during the whole leafon. Captain Hamilton relates,
that when he visited Tatta, no rain had fallen for three
years before. Memoirs, p. 288.-Tamerlane, who,
by the vicinity of the feat of his government to India,
had the means of being well informed concerning the
nature of the country, avoided the error of Alexander,
and made his Indian campaign during the dry season.
As Nadir Shah, both when he invaded India, A. D.
1738, and in his return next year, marched through
the fame countries with Alexander, and nearly in the
fame line of direction, nothing can give a more itri-
Ling idea of the persevering ardour of the MIacedonian
conqueror, than the description of the d(itffculties
which Nadir Shal had to surmount, and the hard-
ships which his army endured. Though pofitcl'ed of
absolute power and inlmenfe wealth, and diflinguilhed
no less by great talents than long experience in the
conduEt of war, he had the mortification to lose a
great part of his troops in ctoffing the rivers of the
Panjab, in penetrating through the mountains to the
north of India, and in conflits with the fierce natives
il,:abiting the countries which firetch from the
lanks of the Oxus to the frontiers of Persia. An

in the Memoirs of Khojeh Abdulkurreen, a Cafllme-

THAT a fleet so numerous should have been collected
in such a short time, is apt to appear, at first fight,

incredible. Arrian, however, as'ures us, that in fpe,
cifying this number, he followed Ptolemy, the foil of
Lagus, whofc authority he confidered to be of the
greatest weight, lib. vi. c. 3. But as the Panjab
country is full of navigable rivers, on which all the
intercourfc among the natives was carried on, it
abounded with veYffls ready constru-ed to the con,
queror's hands, so that he might easily collect that
iumnber. If we could give credit to the account of
the invasion of India by Semiramis, no fewer than
four thousand vessels were afiembled in the Indus to
oppose her fleet. Diod. Sicul. lib. ii. c. 74-It is
remarkable that when MIahmoud of Gaznali invaded
India, a fleet was coilected on the Indus to oppolt
him, consisting of the fame number of veTfels. We
learn from the Ayeen Akbery, that the inhabitants of
this part of India still continue to carry on all their
communication with each other by water ; the inha-
bitants of the Circar of Tatta alone have not less than

Ai Y. t!ecfe particulars are taken from the Indian

Hillor)y of Arrian. a work diiferent from that already
mentioncd. and one of the most curious treatises
tranfmittc.l to us from antiquity. The first part of it
confilts of extracts from the account given by Near-
chus of the climate and foil of India, and the man-
ners of t'e natives. The second contains that officer's
journal of his voyage from the mouth of the Indus to
the l;c:;om of the 'crfian Gulf. The perusal of it

gin cs

eives rife to several obfervations.-i. It is remarkable
that neither Nearchus, nor Ptolemy, nor Ariftobulus,
nor even Arrian, once mention the voyage of Scylax.
This could not proceed from their being unacquainted
.ith it, for Herodotus was a favourite author in the
hands of every Greek who had any pretensions to
literature. It was probably occasioned by the reasons
which they had to diitruft the veracity of Scylax, of
which I have already taken notice. Accordingly, in a
speech which Arrian puts into the mouth of Alexan-
der, he aflerts that, except Bacchus, he was the first
who had pafled the Indus; which implies, that he dif-
bclicv d what is related concerning Scylax, and was
plot acquainted with what Darius Hyftafpes is said to
have done in order to subject that part of India to the
l'erfian crown. Arrian, vii. c. lo. This opinion is
confirmed by Megaithenes, who resided a considerable
time in India. He afierts that, except Bacchus and
Hercules, (to whose fabulous expeditions Strabo is
astonished that he ihould have given any credit,
lib. xv. p. 1007. D.) Alexander was the first who had
invaded India; Arrian, Hist. Indic. c. 5. We are
informed by Arrian, that the Aflacani, and other
people who poieffed that country, which is now
called the kingdom of Candahar, paid tribute, first to
the Aflyrians, and afterwards to the Medes and Per-
sians; Hist. Indic. c. r. As all the fertile provinces
on the north-wcft of the Indus were anciently
reckoned to be part of India, it is probable that what
was levied from them is the fum mentioned in the
tribute-roll, from whlich Ilerodotus drew his account
of the annual revenue of the Perian empire, and that
none of the provinces to the south of the Indus were

ever

ever subjea to the kings of Persia. -2. This voyage
of Nearchus affords some striking inflances of the im-
perfect knowledge which the ancients had of any
navigation different from that to which they were ac-
customed in the Mediterranean. Though the enter-
prifing genius and enlarged views of Alexander
prompted him to attempt opening an intercourse by
sea between India and his Persian dominions, yet both
he and Nearchus knew so little of the ocean which
they wished to explore, as to be apprehensive that it
might be found impossible to navigate it, on account
of impervious firaits, or other obstacles. Hist. Indic.
C. 2o. Q.Curt. lib. ix. c. 9. When the fleet arrived
near the mouth of the Indus, the astonishment excited
by the extraordinary flow and ebb of tide in the In-
dian ocean, a phenomenon (according to Arrian) with
which Alexander and his soldiers were unacquainted,
lib. vi. c. 19. is another proof of their ignorance in
maritime science. Nor is there any reason to be fur-
prifed at their astonishment, as the tides are hardly
perceptible in the Mediterranean, bevond which the
knowledge of the Greeks and Macedonians did not
extend. For the fame reason, when the Romans
carried their victorious arms into the countries situated
on the Atlantic Ocean, or on the seas that communi-
cate with it, this new phenomenon of the tides was an
objeat of wonder and terror to them. Csefar describes
the amazement of his soldiers at a spring-tide, which
greatly damaged the fleet with which he invaded Bri-
tain, and acknowledges that it was an appearance with
which they were unacquainted ; Bell. Gallic. lib. iv.
c. 29. The tides on the coast near the mouth of the
Indus are remarkably high, and the effects of them

very

very great, especially that sudden and abrupt influx of
the tide into the mouths of rivers or narrow straits
which is known in India by the name of The Bore, and
is accurately described by Major Rennell, Introd. xxiv.
Mem. 278. In the Periplus Maris Erythrai, p. 26.,
these high tides are mentioned, and the description of
them nearly resembles that of the Bore. A very ex-
aggerated account of the tides in the Indian ocean is
given by Pliny, Nat. Hilt. lib. xiii. c. 25. Major Ren-
nell seems to think, that Alexander and his followers
could not be so entirely unacquainted with the pheno-
menon of the tides, as Herodotus had informed the
Greeks, " that in the Red Sea there was a regular ebb
" and flow of the tide every day;" lib. ii. c. I . This
is all the explanation of that phenomenon given by
Herodotus. But among the ancients there occur in-
stances of inattention to fats, related by refpetable
authors, which appear surprising in modern times.
Though Herodotus, as I have just now observcd, gave
an account of the voyage performed by Scylax at con-
fiderable length, neither Alexander, nor his Historians,
take any notice of that event. I fliall afterwards have
occasion to mention a more remarkable instance of the
inattention of later writers to an accurate description
which Herodotus had given of the Caspian sea. From
these, and other similar inflances which might have
been produced, we may conclude, that the flight men-
tion of the regular flow and ebb of tide in the Red
Sea, is not a fuflicient reason for rejecting, as incre-
dible, Arrian's account of the furprifc of Alexander's
soldiers when they firfl beheld the extraordinary eflecs
of the tide at the mouth of the Indus.- 3. The
courfc of Nearchus's voyage, the promontorics, the

creeks,

creeks, the rivers, the cities, the mountains, which
came fuccefively in his view, are so clearly described,
and th;e diftanecs of such as ware molt worthy of
notice are so diftincly marked, that MI. D'Anville, by
comparing these with the actual position of the coun-
try, according to the best accounts of it, ancient as
xwell as modern, has been able to point out most of the
places which Nearchus mentions, with a degree of
certainty which does as much honour to the veracity
of the Grecian navigator, as to the indufiry, learning,
and penetration of the French geographer. Mem. dc
Literat. tom. xxx. p. 132, &c.

IN modern times, the Red Sea is a name appropri.

ated to the Arabian Gulf, but the ancients denomi-
nated the ocean which itretches from that Gulf to
India, the Erythrcan Sea, from king Erythr.as, of
whom nothing more is known than the name, which
in the Greek language significs red. lrom this casual
meaning of the word, it came to be believed, that it
was of a different colour from other seas, and confe-
quently of more dangerous navigation.

NOTE VII. SECT. I. p. 31.

ALEX.'.trLR was so intent on rendering this union

of his fubjeds complete, that after his death there was
found in his tablets or commentaries, (among other
magnificent schemes which he meditated,) a resolution
to build several new cities, some in Aia, and tome in
Europe, and to people those in Aia with Europeanl,
and those in Europe with Asiatics, '" that, (fays the

IIillorian,) by intcrmarriages, and exchange of good

THE Oriental Historians have mingled the little that

they know concerning the tranfadions of European
nations, particularly concerning the reign of Alexan-
der the Great, and his conquest of Persia, with so
many fabulous and incredible circumstances, that
hardly any attention is due to them. Though they
misrepresented every event in his life, they entertained
an high idea of his great power, diftilguifhing him by
the appellation of E.1/;and,,r Dhuicarnei', i. e. the Tuo-
korcd, in allusion to the extent of his dominions,
which, according to them, reachcd from the wAcilcr

Whether the Historians of Indoflan have given an

accuracy, cannot be known, until some of their works,
written in the Sanfkreet, are translated. That some
traditional knowledge of Alexander's invasion of India
is till preservcd in the northern provinces of the Pen-
infula, is manifcft from fcveral circumstances. The
Rajahs of Chitore, who are efteenied the most ancient
eftablilhment of lHindoo princes, and the noblest of
the Rajahpout tribes, boast of their descent from
l'orus, famous as well in the ears as in the weft for
his gallant opposition to the MIacedc.nian conqueror.
(Orme's Fragm. p.. . Major Rennc,; li h informed

13 me,

me, by accounts lately received from India, and
confirmed by a variety of testimonies, that, in the
country of Kuttore, the eastern extreme of the
ancient Baaria, a people who claimed to be the
descendants of Alexander's followers, were existing
when Tamerlane invaded that province. In Bijore, a
country more to the weft in the fame diftrit, the
Bazira of Alexander, there is a tribe at this day
which traces its origin to certain persons left there by
the conqueror when he pafied through that province.
Both Abul Fazel, and Soojah Rae, an eastern Hifto-
rian of good reputation, report this tradition without
any material variation. The latter, indeed, adds, that
these Europeans, if we may call them so, continued
to prefcrve that ascendency over their neighbours,
which their ancestors may be supposed to have poffefled
when they firfL fettled here. Although we should
rejec this pedigree as false, yet the bare claim argues
the belief of the natives, for which there must have
been some foundation, that Alexander not only con-
quered Bijore, but also transferred that conquest to
fame of his own countrymen. Rennell Mem. 2d
edit. p. 162. The people of Bijore had likewise an
high idea of Alexander's extensive authority; and they,
too, denominated him the Two-horned, agreeably to
the striking emblem of power in all the eastern lan-
guages. Ayeen Akbery, xi. 194. Xlany instances
of this emblem being used, will occur to every person
accustomed to read the sacred Scriptures.

NOTE IX. SECT. I. P. 33;

IT seems to be an opinion generally received, that

Alexander built only two cities in India, Nicaea and
Bucephalia, situated on the Hydafpes, the modern
Chelum, and that Craterus superintended the building
of both. But it is evident, from Arrian, lib. v.
c. ult., that he built a third city on the Acefines, now
the Jenaub, under the direction of Hephaefion; and
if it was his object to retain the command of the
country, a place of strength on some of the rivers to
the south of the Hydafpes seems to have been necefiary
for that purpose. This part of India has been so little
visited in modern times, that it is impossible to point
out with precision the situation of these cities. If P.
Tieffenthaler were well founded in his conjeCture, that
the river now called Rauvee is the Acefines of Arrian,
Bernouilli, vol. i. p. 39., it is probable that this city
was built Somewhere near Lehore, one of the most
important stations in that part of India, and reckoned
in the Ayeen Akbery to be a city of very high
antiquity. But Major Rennell, in wy opinion, gives
good reasons for fuppofng the Jenaub to be the Ace-
fines of the ancients.

THE religious scruples which prevented the Persians

from making any voyage by sea, were known to the
ancients. Pliny relates of one of the Magi, who was

tc Maria, alijfque rmortalium neceflitatibus violare na-

that, according to the observation of a well-informed
Historian, there was not a city of any note in their
empire built upon the fea-coalt; Ammian. Marcel.
lib. xxiii. c. 6. We leai from Dr. Hyde, how inti-
ratelv these ideas were conneced with tle dodtrines
of Zoroaster; Rel. Vet. Perf. cap. vi. In all the
wars of the Persians with Greece, the fleets of the
Great King confited entirely of filips furnifled by the
Phenicians, Syrians, the conquered provinces of the
Lesser Asia, and the islands adjacent. Herodotus and
Diodorus Siculus mention the quota furnished by each
country, in order to compote the fleet of twelve
hundred ships with which Xerxes invaded Greece, and
among these there is not one belonging to Persia. At
the fame time it is proper to observe, that, according to
Herodotus, whose authority is unexceptionable with
regard to this point, Ariabigines, a son of Darius,
aced as Admiral of the Persian fleet, and had several
satraps of high rank under his command, and both
'erfians and AMede ficrved as soldiers on board of it

to tl.olt of the Pcrfians, many of the natives of In-
duftln, in our owni time, refuse to embark on board a

NOTE XL SECT. I. P. 34,

M. LE BARON DE SAINTE-CROIX, in his ingenious

and learned Critique des Hiftoriens d'Alexandre le
Grand, p. 96, seems to entertain some doubt with
refpet to the number of the cities which Alexander
is said to have built. Plutarch de Fort. Alcx. affirms,
that he founded no fewer than seventy. It appears
from many passages in ancient authors, that the build-
ing of cities, or, what may be confidered as the fame,
the establishment of fortified stations, was the mode
of maintaining their authority in the conquered na-
tions, adopted not only by Alexander, but by his fuc-
ceffors. Seleucus and Antiochus, to whom the greater
part of the Persian empire became subjed, were no
less remarkable sot founding new cities than Alexan-
der, and these cities seem fully to have answered ;he
purposes of the founders, as they effectually prevented
(as I shall afterwards have occasion to observe) the
revolt of the conquered provinces. Though the
Greeks, animated with the love of liberty and of their
native country, refused to fettle in the Persian empire
while under the dominion of its native monarchs, even
when allured by the prospect of great advantage, as
M. de Sainte-Croix remarks, the cafe became perfectly
different, when that empire was fubje&ted to their
own dominion, and they fettled there, not as fubjcEts,
but as masters. Both Alexander and his fucceflbrs
discovered much discernment in choofing the situation
of the cities which they built. Seleucia, which Se-
leucus founded, is a striking instance of this, and

A A became

became hardly inferior to Alexandria in number of
inhabitants, in wealth, and in importance; Mr. Gib-
bon, vol. i. p. 25;. M. D'Anville, Mem. de Li.
terat. xxx.

NOTE Xi. SECT. I. . 38.

IT is from Juftin we receive the slender knowledge

m-e have of the progress which Seleucus made in
I: dia; lib. xv. c. 4. But we cannot rely on his evi-
dence, unless when it is confirmed by the tcltimony of
o:hcr authors. Plutarch seems to aflert, that Seleucus
had penetrated far into India; but that refpestable
writer is more eminent for his discernment of cha-
ralers, and his happy feleifon of those circumflances
which mark and discriminate them, than for the ac-
curacy of his hittorical researches. Pliny. whose
.'thority is of greater weight, fcems to confider it as
certain, that Seleucus had carried his arms into
districts of India which Alexander never visited; Piin.
Nat. Hilt. lib. vi. c. I7. The pal`age in which this
is mentioned, is somewhat obscure, but it seems to
imply, that Seleucus had marched from the Hyphafis
to the Hyfudrus, from thence to Palibothra, and front
that to the muuth of the Ganges. The distances of
the principal tRations in this march are marked, the
whole amuntinlg to 2244 Roman miles. In this sense,
MI. Bayer unlc-rltands the words of Pliny; IHiftor.
Regni ;Grcorum Bafriani, p. 37. But to me it ap-
pears highly improbable, that the Indian expedition of
Seleucus could have continued so long as to allow time
fbr operations of such extent. If Seleucus had ad-

vanced

vanced as far into India as the mouth of the Ganges,
the ancients must have had a more accurate know-
ledge of that part of the country than they seem ever
to have possessed.

NOTE XIII. SECT.I. p.39.

MAJOR RENNELL gives a magnificent idea of this,

by informing us, that " the Ganges, after it has
" escaped from the mountainous trac in which
"it had wandered above eight hundred miles,"
Mem. p. 233. " receives in its course through the
, plains eleven rivers, some of them as large as the

Rhine, and none smaller than the Thames, besides
" as many more of lesser note;" p. 257.

NOTE XIV. SECT. I. P. 39.

IN fixing the position of Palibothra, I have ventured

to differ from Major Rennell, and I venture to do so
wvith diffidence. According to Strabo, Palibothra was
situated at the junCtion of the Ganges and another
river; lib. xv. p. 1023. A. Arrian is still more ex-
plicit. He places Palibothra at the confluence of the
Ganges and Erranaboas, the last of which he describes
as less than the Ganges or Indus, but greater than any
other known river; Hist. Ind. c. o1. This description
of its situation corresponds exactly with that of Alla-
habad. P. Boudier, to whose observations the geo-
graphy of India is much indebted, fays, that the
Jumna, at its junftion with the Ganges, appeared to

AA him

him not inferior in magnitude to that river; D'Anville,
Antiq. de 1' Inde, p. 53. Allahabad is the name which
was given to that city by the emperor Akbar, who
ereted a Rfrong fortress there; an elegant delineation
of which is published by Mr. Hodges, No. IV. of his
Selec Views in India. Its ancient name, by which
it is ftiil known among the Hindoos, is Praeg, or
Piyag, and the people of the district are called Praegi,
which bears a near resemblance to Prafij, the ancient
Appellation of the kingdom of which Palibothra was
the capital; P. Tieffenthaler, Bernouilli, tom. i. 223.
D'Anville, p. 56. Allahabad is such a noted feat of
Hindoo devotion, that it is denominated The King of
Worjbippd Places; Ayeen Akbery, vol. ii. p. 35,
" The territory around it, to the extent of forty miles,

is deemed holy ground. The Hindoos believe, that

' when a man dies in this place, whatever he wishes
" for he will obtain in his next regeneration. Al-
*" though they teach that suicide in general will be
" punished with torments hereafter, yet they confider
ic it as meritorious for a man to kill himself at Alla-
"c habad ;" Ayeen Akbery, iii. 256. P. Tieffenthaler
describes the various objects of veneration at Allaha-
bad, which are Itill vifit-d with great devotion by an
immense number of pilgrims; Bernouilli, tom. i. 224.
From all thcfe circumrtanccs, we may conclude it to
be a place of great antiquity, and in the fame situation
with the PaliDothra of antiquity.

MAJOR RF.NsEI.L has been induced to place Pali-

bothra on the Lime site with Patna, chiefly by two
confileraticns.-- . From having learned that on or
near the site of Patna stood anciently a. very large city

i:cS~ ~~named

named Patetpoto-her or Patalipputra, which nearly
rtfembles the ancient name of Palibothra. Although
there is not now a confluence of two rivers at Patna,
he was informed that the junCtion of the Soanc with
the Ganges, now twenty-two miles above Patna, was
formerly under the walls of that city. The rivers of
India sometimes change their course in a singular man-
ner, and he produces some remarkable instances of it.
But even should it be allowed, that the accounts which
the natives give of this variation in the course of the
Soane were perfecly accurate, I question whether
Arrian's description of the magnitade of the Errana.
boas be applicable to that river, certainly not so justly
as to the Jumna.- a. He seems to have been in-
fluenced, in some degree, by Pliny's Itinerary, or
Ta'1le of Distances from 'raxil (the modern Attock) to
the mouth of the Ganges; Nat. Hiit. lib. vi. c. 17.
But the distances in that Itinerary are marked so in-
accurately, and in some instances are so palpably
erroneous, that one cannot found upon them with
much fccurity. According to it, Palibothra is situated
four hundred and twenty-five miles below the con-
flutnce of the Jumna and Ganges. The aCtual dif.
tancc, however, between Allahabad and Patna, is not
more than two hundred British miles A disagree-
mcnt so c',nfiderable cannot be accounted for, without
fuppofiig some extraordinary error in the Itinerary, or
that the point of conflux of the Jumna with the Ganges
has underuone a change. For the former of thcfe sup-
pofitio:s there is no authority (as far as I know) from
any manuscript, or for the latter from any tradition.
M'Iajor Renn-ll has prolucedl the reaforns which lel him
to fuppofc the site of Palibothra to bee fame with

AA 3 that

that of Patna; Memoirs, p. 49-54. Some of the
objeaions which might be made to this supposition he
has foreseen, and endeavoured to obviate; and after
all that I have added to them, I ihall not be surprised,
if, in a geographical difcuflon, my readers are dif.
posed to prefer his decision to mine.

As the distance of Arfnoe, the modern Suez, from

the Nile, is considerably less than that between Bere-
nice and Coptos, it was by this route that all the com-
modities imported into the Arabian Gulf, might have
been conveyed with most expedition and least expence
into Egypt. But the navigation of the Arabian Gulf,
which even in the present improved state of nautical fci.
ence is flow and difficult, was in ancient times consfdered
by the nations around it to be so extremely perilous, that
it led them to give such names to fevcral of its pro-
montories, bays, and harbours, as convey a striking
idea of the impression which the dread of this danger
had made upon their imagination. The entry into
the Gulf they called Babelnandeb, the gate or port of
affliction. To a harbour not far distant, they gave
the name of Mete, i. e. Death. A headland adjacent
they called Gardefan, the Cape of Burial. Other dc-
nominations of similar import are mentioned by the
author to whom I am indebted for this information.
Bruce's Travels, vol. i. p. 442, &c. It is not furprif,
ing then, that the flaple of Indian trade should have
been transferred from the northern extremity of the
Arabian Gulf to Berenice, as by this change a danger-
ous navigation was greatly ihortencd. This seems to
have been the chief reason that induced Ptolemy to
eftablifl the port of communication with Inlia at Be-
renice, as there were other harbours on the Arabia:i
Gulf which were considerably nearer than it to ihe
N2il. At a later period, after the ruin of Coptos by

A A 4 te

the Emperor Diocletian, we are informed by Abulfedal
Dcfcript. Egypt. edit. Michaelis, p. 77, that Indian
commodities were conveyed from the Red Sea to the
Nile, by the shortest route, viz. from Coffeir, proba-
bly the Philoteras Portus of Ptolemy, to Cous, the
Vicus Apollinis, a journey of four days. The fame
account of the distance was given by the natives to
Dr. Pococke, Travels, vol. i. p. 87. In consequence
of this, Cous, from a small village, became the city in
upper Egypt next in magnitude to Foftat, or Old Cairo.
In process of time, from causes which I cannot explain,
the trade from the Red Sea by Coffeir removed to
Kene, farther down the river than Cous, Abulf. p. 13.

all the commodities of India imported into Egypt, are
either brought by sea from Gidda to Suez, and thence
carried on camels to Cairo, or are conveyed by land
carriage by the caravan returning from the pilgrimage
to Mecca, Niebuhr Voyage, tom. i. p. 224. Volney, i.
188, &c. This, as far as I have been able to trace it,
is a complete account of all the different routes by
which the produtions of the East have been conveyed
to the Nile, from the first opening of that communi-
cation. It is singular that P. Sicard, Mem. des Miflions
dans le Levant, tom. ii. p. 1I7, and some other re-
fpectabie writers, flould suppose Coffeir to be the Be-
renice founded by Ptolemy, although Ptolemy has laid
down its latitude at 23 50', and Strabo has described
it as nearly under the fame parallel with that of Syene,
lib. ii. p. Iy9, D. In consequence of this mistake,
Pliny's computation of the distance between Berenice
and Coptos, at two hundred and fifty-eight miles, has
been deemed erroneous. Pococke, p. 87. But as

Pliny

Pliny not only mentions the total distance, but names
the different stations in the journey, and specifies the
number of miles between each; and as the Itinerary
of Antoninus coincides exactly with his account,
D'Anville Egypte, p. 21, there is no reason to call in
question the accuracy of it.

NOTE XVIII. SECT. I. p. 48.

MAJOR RENNELL is of opinion, c that under the

i' Ptolemies, the Egyptians extended their navigation to
' the extreme point of the Indian continent, and even
" failed up the Ganges to Palibothra," on the fame site
(according to him) with the modern Patna. Introd.
p. xxxvi. But had it been usual to fail up the Ganges
as high as Patna, the interior parts of India must have
been better known to the ancients than they ever
were, and they would not have continued to derive
their information concerning them from Megaf-
thenes alone. Strabo begins his description of
India in a very remarkable manner. He requests
his readers to peruse with indulgence the account
which he gives of. it, as it was a country very
remote, and few persons had vifted it; and of these,
many having fen only a small part of the country,
related things either from hear-say, or, at the best,
what they had hastily remarked while they passed
through it in the course of military fcrvice, or on a
journey. Strabo, lib. xv. p. 1005. B. lie takes notice
that few of the traders from the Arabian Culf ever
reached the Ganges. Ibid. 1co6. C. He asserts,
that the Ganges enters the sea by one mouth, ibid.

io11.

101 . C.; an error into which he could not have fal.
len if the navigation of that river had been common
in his time. He mentions indeed the failing up the
Ganges, ibid. Io:o, but it is cursorily in a single fen-
tencc; whereas, if such a confidcrable inland voyage
of above four hundred miles, through a populous and
rich country, had been cuflomary, or even if it hail

Egyptian trader., it must lihve merited a particular de-
scription, and must have been mentioned by Pliny
and other writers, as there was nothing similar to it
in the practice of navigation amnong the ancients. It
is observed by Arrian, (or whoever is the author of the
Periplus Iaris Erythraci,) that previous to the dif-
covcry of a new route to India, which {hall be men-
tioned afterwards, the commerce with that country
was carried on in small vessels which failed round
every bay, p. 32. Ap. Hudf. Geogr. Min. Vessels of
such light conftrucion, and which followed this mode
of failing, were ill fitted for a voyage so distant as
that round Cape Comorin, and up the bay of Beng::I,
to Patna. It is riot improbable, that the merchants
-c»+ whom Strabo mentions as having reached the Ganges,

may have travelled thither by land, either from the
counrries towards the mouth of the Indus, or from
some part of the Malnbar coast, and that the navi;:a-

THE erroneous ideas of many intelligent writers of

antiquity with refpe& to the Caspian Sea, though well
known to every man of letters, are so remarkable, and
afford such a itriking example of the imperfe&ion of
their geographical knowledge, that a more full account
of them may not only be acceptable to some of my
readers, but in endeavouring to trace the various routes
by which the commodities of the East were conveyed
to the nations of Europe, it becomes necessary to enter
into some detail concerning their various sentiments
with refped to tliis matter. I. According to Strabo,
the Caspian is a bay, that communicates with the great
Northern ocean, from which it issues at first, by a nar-
row firait, and then expands intp a sea extending in
breadth five hundred stadia, lib. xi. p. 773. A. With
him Pomponius Mela agrees, and describes the strait
by which the Ciafpian is conneced with the ocean, as
of considerable length, and so narrow that it had the
appearance of a river, lib. iii. c. 5. edit. Pliny like-
wife gives a similar description of it, Nat. Hiit. lib. vai.
c. 13. In the age of Juflinian, this opinion concern-
ing the communication of the Caspian Sea with the
ocean, was still prevalent; Cofm. Indicopl. Topog.
Christ. lib. 2. p. 138. C. 2. Some early writers, by a
mistake still more singular, havefuppofed the Caspian Sea
to be conneted with the Euxine. QuintusCurtius, whose
ignorance of geography is notorious, has adopted this
error, lib. vii. c. 7. edit. 3. Arnian, though a much
more judicious writer, and who by residing for some

time

time in the Roman province of Cappadocia, of which
le was governor, might have obtained more accurate
information, declares in one place, the origin of the
Carpian Sea to be fill unklsnown, and is doubtful whe-
ther it was conneted with the Euxine, or with the
great Eastern ocean which surrounds India; lib. vii.
c. 16. In another place he asserts, that there was a
communication between the Caspian and th. Eastern
ocean; lib. v. c. 26. These errors appear more extra
ordinary, as a just description had been given of the
Caspian by Herodotus, near five hundred years before
the age of Strabo. " The Caspian (fays he) is a sea
" by itself, unconneced with any other. Its length is
" as much as a vessel with oars can fail in fifteen days,
" its greatef breadth as much as it can fail in eight
" days;" lib. i. c. 2c3. Ariltotle describes it in the
fame manner, and with his usual precision contends
that it ought to be called a great lake not a sea; Mete-
orolog. lib. ii. Diodorus Siculus concurs with them
in opinion, vol. ii. lib. xviii. p. 26I. None of those
authors determine whether the greatest length of the
Caspian was from North to South, or from East to
Weft. In the ancient maps which illustrate the geo-
graphy of Ptolemy, it is delineated, as if its greatest
length extended from East to Weft. In modern times,
the first information concerning the true form of the
Caspian which the people of Europe received, was
given by Anthony Jenkinron, an English merchant,
who with a caravan from Russia travelled along a con-
jiderable part of its coast in the year 1558 i Hakluyt
Cc'!k. vol. i. F. 334. The accuracy of Jenkinfon's
description was confirmed by an adual survey of that
sea rmad. by order cf Seter the Great, A. D. 17 1 8

and

and it is now ascertained not only that the Caspian is
unconnected with any other sea, but that its length
from North to South is considerably more than its
greatest breadth from East to Welt. The length of
the Caspian from North to South is about fix hundred
and eighty miles, and in no part more than two hun-
dred and sixty miles in breadth from East to Well.
Coxe's Travels, vol. ii. p. 257. The proportional differ-
ence of its length and breadth accords nearly with
that mentioned by Herodotus. From this detail, how-
ever, we learn how the ill-founded ideas concerning it,
which were generally adopted, gave rife to various
wild schemes of conveying Indian commodities to Eu-
rope by means of its supposed communication with
the Euxine sea, or with the Northern ocean. It is an
additional proof of the attention of Alexander the
Great to every thing conducive to the improvement of
commerce, that a short time before his death he gave
direcions to fit out a squadron in the Calpian, in or-
der to survey that fen, and to difcovsr whether it was
conneced either with the Euxine or Indian ocean;
Arrian. lib. vii. c. 16.

NOTE XX. SECT. I. p. 62.

FROM this curious detail, we learn low imperfect

ancient navigaion was, even in its most improved state.
The voyage from Betrnice to Occlis, could not have
taken thirty days, if any other course had been he!d
than that of servilely following the windings of the
coast. The voyage from Ocelis to lMufiris would be
(according to Major Rennlell) fifteen days run for an

European

Europcan ship in the modern stile of navigation, being
about seventeen hundred and fifty marine miles, on a
straight course; Introd. p. xxxvii. It is remarkable,
that though the Periplus Marns Erythraei was written
after the voyage of Hippalus, the chief objed of the'
author of it is to describe the ancient course along the
coails of Arabia and Persia, to the mouth of the Indus,
and from thence down the western shore of the con-
tinent to Iufiris. I can account for this, only by
supposing, that from the unwillingness of mankind to
abandon old habits, the greater part of the traders from
Berenice still continued to follow that route to which
they were accustomed. To go from Alexandria to
Mufiris, required (according to Pliny) ninety-four
days. In the year 1788, the Boddam, a ship belong-
ing to the Eogliflh Eaft-India Company, of a thousand
tons burthen, took only fourteen days more to com-
plete her voyage from Portsmouth to Madras. Such
are the improvements which have been made in
navigation.

NOTE XXI. SECT. IT. p. 63.

IT was the opinion of Plato, that in a well-regulated

commonwealth the citizens flould not engage in com-
merce, nor the state aim at obtaining maritime power.
Commerce, he contends, would corrupt the purity of
their morals, and by entering into the fea-fervice,
they would be accustomed to find pretexts for justify-
ing condut so inconfiftcnt with what was manly ant
becoming, as would gradually relax the tlricnefs of
military difcip!ine. It had been better for the Athe-

nians,

niians, he asserts, to have continued to fend annually
the onls of seven of their principal citizens to be de-.
voured by the Mlinotaur, than to have changed their
ancient manners, and to have become a maritime povwer.
In that pcrfed republic, of which he delineates the
form, he ordains that the capital should be situated at
least ten miles from the sea; De Legibus, lib. iv. ab
initio. These ideas of Plato were adopted by other
philosophers. Ariltotlc enters into a formal discussion
of the question, Whether a tlate rightly conflituted
fliould be commercial or not ? ani; though abundantly
disposed to espouse sentiments opposite to thofc of
Plato, he does not venture to decide explicitly with
refpet to it; De Repub. lib. vii. c. 6. In ages when
such opinions prevail, little information concerning
commerce can be expctted.

palffacs stand in filch direct contradic.ion to one ano-
tlher, that it is impoifble to reconcile them, or to de-
termine which is molt conformable to truth. I have
adhered to ti.e former, bccaufe wsc have many in-
ifances of the exorbitant price of pearls, but none, as
far as I know, of diamonds having been purchased at
a rate so high. In this opinion I am confirmed by a
palTage in Pliny, lib. xix. c. i.; having mentioned the
exorbitant price of AJ1,,/scr, le fays, " equat prretia

" excellentium Margaritarum;" which implies, that he
confidered pearls to be of higher price than any other
commodity.

NOTE XXIII. SECT. II. p.68.

PLINY has devoted two entire books of his Natural

History, lib. xii. and xiii. to the enumeration and de-
scription of the spices, aromatics, ointments, and per-
fumes, the use of which luxury had introduced among
his countrymen. As many of these were the produc-
tions of India, or of the countries beyond it, and as
the trade with the East was carried on to a great ex-
tent in the age of Pliny, we may form some idea of
the immense demand for them, from the high price
at which they continued to be fold in Rome. To com-
pare the prices of the fame commodities in ancient
Rome, with those now paid in our own country, is
not a gratification of curiosity merely, but affords a
standard by which we may estimate the different de-
gree of success with which the Indian trade has been
conduced in ancient and modern times. Many re-
markable passages in ancient authors, concerning the
extravagant price of precious stones and pearls among
the Romans, as well as the general use of them by
perfous of all ranks, are colleced by Meurfius de Lux.

M. MAHUDEL, in a memoir read in the academy of

inscriptions and belles lettres in the year 1719, has
collected the various opinions of the ancients concerni-
ing the nature and origin of silk, which tend all to
prove their ignorance with regard to it. Since the
publication of M. Mahudel's memoir, P. du Halde has
described a species of silk, of which I believe he com-
municated the firit notice to the moderns. " This is

produced by small infeas nearly resembling filails.

- They do not form cocoons either round or oval like
" the silk-worm, but spin very long threads, which
c fasten themfelvcs to trees andbufhes as theyare driven
" by the wind. These are gathered, and wrought
"c into silk stuffs, coarser than those produced by do-
" meltic silk-worms. The insets which produce this
" coarse silk are wild." Dcfcription de t'Empire de
la Chine, tom. ii. folio, p. 207. This nearly refem-
bles Virgil's description,

Velleraque ut foliis depeCtant tenuia Seres,

An attentive reader of Virgil will find, that, betides all
the other qualities of a great descriptive poet, he pof-
sessed an extensive knowledge of nataral history. The
nature and producions of the wild fik-worms are il-
lustrated at greater length in the large collection of
Memoires concernant l'Hiftoire, les Sciences, les Arts,
&cc. des Chinois, tom. ii. p. 575, &c.; and by Pere de

Mailla, in his voluminous History of China, tom. xiii.

silk, that, on account of its being an excretion of a
worm, the Mahomedans confider it as an unclean dress;
and it has been decided, with the unanimous assent of
all the doctors, that a person wearing a garment made
entirely of silk, cannot lawfully offer up the daily
prayers enjoined by the Koran. Herbel. Bibl. Orient,

IF the use of the cotton manufa&ures of India had

THIS part of Arrian's Periplus has been examined

with great accuracy and learning by Lieutenant Wil.

Plithana of Arrian is the moder Pultanah, on the

and seventeen Britifl miles south from Baroach; that
the poiition of Tagara is the fame with that of the mo-
dern Dowlatabad, and the high grounds across which
the goods were conveyed to Baroach, are the Ballagaut
m.ountains. The bcarizngs and distances of there dif-

STkABO acknowledges his negle& of the improve.
ments in geography which Hipparchus had deduced
from astronomical observations, and justifies it by one
of those logical subtleties which the ancients were apt

fays he, (i. e. a describer of the earth,) " is to pay no
" attention to what is out of the earth; nor will men,

WHAT an high opinion the ancients had of Ptolemy,

we learn from Agathemerus, who flouriffed not long
after him. " Ptolemy," fays he, " who reduced geo-
" graphy into a regular system, treats of every thing
"relating to it, not carelessly, or merely according
" to ideas of his own; but attending to what had
" been delivered by more ancient authors, he adopted
" from them whatever he found consonant to truth."

fame admiration of his work, Agathodsemon, an artist

As these public Surveys and Itineraries furnished the

ancient geographers with the belt information concern-
ing the position and distances of many places, it may
be proper to point out the manner in which they were
completed by the Romans. The idea of a general
survey of the whole empire was first formed by Julius
Caesar, and, having been begun by him under authority
of a decree of the senate, was finished by Augustus.
As Rome was till far inferior to Greece in science, the
execution of this great undertaking was committed to
three Greeks, men of great abilities, and fcilled in
every part of philosophy. The survey of the eastern
division of the empire was finifled by Zenodoxus in
fourteen years five months and nine days. That of
the n.~rhern division was finished by Theodotus in
twenty years eight months and ten days. The southern
division was finished in twenty-five years one month
and ten days. AEthici Cofmographia apud Geogra-
phos, editos a Hen. Stephano, 1577. p. 107. This
undertaking was worthy of those illustrious persons
who planned it, and suited to the magnificence of a
great people. Besides this general survey, every new
war produced a new delineation and measurement of
the.countries which were the feat of it. We may con-
clude from Vegetius, Infit. Rei Militaris, lib. iii. c. 6.

7 that

that every governor of a Roman province was furnithed
with a description of it in which were specified the
distance of places in miles, the nature of the roads,
the bye-roads, the lhort cuts, the mountains, the rivers,
&c.; all these, fays he, were not only described in
words, but were delineated in a map, that, in delibe-
rating concerning his military movements, the eyes of
a general might aid the decisions of his mind.

NOTE XXX. SECT. II. . 83.

Tim consequence of this mistake is remarkable.

Ptolemy, lib. vii. c. i., computes the latitude of Bary-
gaza, or Baroach, to be 17' 20'; and that of Cory, or
Cape Comorin, to be 13 2 o', which is the difference
of four degrees precisely whcreas the real difference
between these two places is nearly fourteen degrees.

NOTE XXXI. SECT. II. p. 84.

RAMUSIO, the publifier of the molR ancient and per-

haps the molt valuable Colleetion of Voyages, is the
first person, as far as I know, who takes notice of this
strange error of Ptolemy; Viaggi, vol. i. p. 1i . He
jutly observes, that the Author of the Circumnavi-
gation of the Erythrxean Sea had been more accurate,
and had described the peninsula of India as extcnding
from north to south, Peripl. p. 24. 29.

NOTE XXXII. SECT. II. p. 87.

THns error of Ptolemy justly merits the name of

enrornosr, which I have given to it; and it will appear
miore fvrprifing when we rccollcet, that he must have

B 3- been

been acquainted, not only with what Herodotus relates
concerning the circumnavigation of Africa, by order of
one of the Egyptian kings, lib. iv. c. 4., but with the
opinion of Eratosthenes, who held that the great ex-
tent of the Atlantic ocean was the only thing which
prevented a communication between Europe and India
by sea; Strab. Geogr. lib. i. p. I 13. A. This error,
however, must not be imputed wholly to Ptolemy.
Hipparchus, whom we may confider as his guide, had
taught that the earth is not surrounded by one conti-
nuous ocean, but that it is separated by different ifth-
muses, which divide it into several large bafons; Strab.
lib. i. p. x . B.. Ptolemy, having adopted this opinion,
was induced to maintain that an unknown country ex-
tended from Cattigara to Praffum on the south-east
coast of Africa; Geogr. lib. vii. c. 3 and 5. As Pto-
lemy's system of geography was universally received,
this error spread along with it. In conformity to it
the Arabian geographer Edrifli, who wrote in the
twelfth century, taught that a continued tradt of land
ftrctched eastward from Sofala on the African coast,
until it united with some part of the Indian continent;

lume of Gefta Dei per Francos, there is an ancient

supposes to have connected Africa with Aia; Geo,

Is this part of the Disquisition, as well as in the

map prepared for illustrating it, the geographical ideas
of M. D'Anville, to which Major Rennell has given
the fanftion of his approbation, Introd. p. xxxix. have
been generally adopted. But M. Goffellin has lately
published, " The Geography of the Greeks analifed
" or, the Systems of Eratothenes, Strabo, and Ptole-
" my, compared with each other, and with the Know-

ledge which the Moderns have acquired;" a learned

and ingenious work, in which he differs from his
countryman with refped to many of his determina-
tions. According to M. Goffellin, the Magnum Pro-
montorium, which M. D'Anville concludes to be Cape
Romania, at the southern extremity of the peninsula
of Malacca, is the point of Bragu, at the mouth of
the great river Ava; near to which he places Zaba,
supposed by M. D'Anville, and by Barros, Decad.
ii. liv. vi. c. i. to be situated on the strait of Sincapura
or Malacca. The Magnus Sinus of Ptolemy he holds
to be the fame with the Gulf of Martaban, not the
Gulf of Siam, according to M. D'Anville's decision.
The position of Cattigara, as he endeavours to prove,
corresponds to that of Mergui, a considerable port on
the weft coast of the kingdom of Siam, and that Thinre,
or Sinae Metropolis, which M. D'Anville removes as
far as Sin-hoa, in the kingdom of Cochin China, is
situated on the fame river with Mergui, and now bears
the name of Tana-ferim. The Ibadij Infula of Ptolemy,
which M. D'Anville determines to be Sumatra, he

B B 4. contends,

contends, is one of that clufRer of fllall isles which
lie off this part of the coast of Siam; p. 137--48.
According to M. GoiTellin's system, the ancients never
failed through the Straits of Malacca, had no know-
ledge of the island of Sumatra, and were altogether
unacquainted with the Eastem Ocean. If to any of
my readers these opinions appear to be well founded,
the navigation and commerce of the ancients in India
must be circumscribed within limits still more confined
than those which I have allotted to them. From the
Ayeen Akbery, vol. ii. p. 7. we learn that Cheen was
an ancient name of the kingdom of Pegu; as that
country borders upon Ava, where M. Gosfellin places
the Great Promontory, this near resemblance of names
may appear, perhaps, to confirm his opinion that Sing
Bletropo!is was situated on this coast, and not so far
East as M. D'Anvilie has placed it.

As Ptolemy's geography of this eastern diviGon of

Asia is more erroneous, obscure, and contradicory
than in any other part of his work, and as all the
manuscripts of it, both Greek and Latin, are remark-
ably incorrect in the two chapters which contain the
description of the countries beyond the Ganges, M.
D'Anville, in his Memoir concerning the limits of the
world known to the ancients beyond the Ganges, has
admitted into it a larger portion of conjecure than
we find in the other researches of that cautious geo-
grapl.er. He likewise builds more than usual upon
the refemblanccs between the ancient and modern
names of places, though at all times he discovers a
propcnrity, perhaps too great, to trace thcfe, and to
rcft upon them. Thcfe rcfcmb!ances are often, indeed,

v'erv

very striking, and have led him to many happy disco-
veries. But in perusing his works, it is impossible, I
should think, not to perceive that some which he
mentions are far fetched and fanciful. Whenever I
follow him, I have adopted only such conclusions as
fecm to be eftabliflied with his accustomed accuracy.

NOTE XXXIV. SECT. II. . 99.

THE Author of the Circumnavigation of the Ery-

thrlean Sea has marked the diflances of many of the
places which he mentions, with such accuracy as ren-
ders it a nearer approach, than what is to be found in
any writer of antiquity, to a complete survey of the
coast from Myos-hormus, on the welt fide of the Ara-
bian Gulf, along the shores of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia,
and Caramania, to the mouth of the Indus, and thence
down the weft coast of the Indian Peninsula to Mufiris
and Barace. This adds to the value of this fliott trea-
tife, which, in every other reflpcd, poficffcs great
merit. It may be confidered as a remarkable proof of
the extent and accuracy of this Author's intelligence
concerning India, that he is the only ancient writer
who appears in any degree to have been acquainted
with the great division of the country, which still sub-
sifts, viz. Indoftan Proper, comprehending the northern
provinces of the Pcninfula, and the Deccan, compre-
hending the southern provinces. " From Barygaza
;' (fays he) the continent firctchcs to the south; hence
- that diftri& is called Dachinabades, for, in the
"' language of the country, the south is called Dacha-
" nos;" Pcripl. p.. 29. As the Greeks and Romans,

when

when they adopt any foreign name, always gave it a
termination peculiar to their own language, which
the grammatical Rfru&ure of both tongues rendered,
in some degree, necessary, it is evident that Dachanos
is the fame with Deccan, which word has still the
fame signification, and is till the name of that division
of the Peninsula. The northern limit of the Deccan
at present is the river Narbudda, where our Author
likewise fixes it. Peripl. ibid.

NOTE XXXV. SECT. II. .. 103.

THOCGH, in deducing the latitudes of places from

observations of the fun or stars, the ancient aftrono-
mers negleced several corretions, which ought to
have been applied, their results were Sometimes exaa
to a few minutes, but at other times they appear to
have been erroneous to the extent of two, or even
three degrees, and may perhaps be reckoned, one with
another, to have come within half a degree of the
truth. This part of the ancient geography would
therefore have been tolerably accurate, if there had
been a sufficient number of such determinations. These,
however, were far from being numerous, and appear
to have been confined to some of the more remarkable
places in the countries which surround the Mediterra-
nean lea.

Wil.EN, from want of more accurate observations,

the latitude was inferred from the length of the longest
or shortest day, no great degree of precision was, in
pny cafe, to be expected, and leat of all in the vicinity

of

of the Equator. An error of a quarter of an hour,
which, without some mode of measuring time more
accurate than ancient observers could employ, was not
easily avoided, might produce, in such situations, an
error of four degrees in the determination of the
latitude.

WITH refpet to places in the torrid zone, there

was another resource for determining the latitude.
This was by observing the time of the year when the
fun was vertical to any place, or when bodies that
fttood perpendicular to the horizon had no shadow at
noon-day; the fun's distance from the Equator at that
time, which was known from the principles of aftro-
nomy, was equal to the latitude of the place. We
have instances of the application of this method in
the determination of the parallels of Syene and Meroe.
The accurady which this method would admit of,
seems to be limited to about half a degree, and this
only on the fuppoGtion that the observer was stationary;
for if he was travelling from one place to another, and
had not an opportunity of correcting the observation
of one day by that of the day following, he was likely
to deviate much more considerably from the truth.

WITH refpet to the longitude of places, as eclipses

of the moon are not frequent, and could seldom be of
ife for determining it, and only when there were aftro-
nomers to obfervc them with accuracy, they may be
left out of the account altogether when we are ex-
amining the geography of remote countries. The dif-
ferences of the meridians of places were therefore
anciently ascertained entirely by the bearings and dif-

tanlces

tances of one place from another, and of consequence
all the errors of reckonings, furvevs, and itineraries,
fell chiefly upon the longitude, in the fame manner
as happens at present in a Ihip which has no method
of determining its longitude, but by comparing the
dead-reckoning with the obfervatioits of the latitude
though with this difference, that the errors, to which
the most &ilful of the ancient navigators was liable,
were far greater than what the most ignorant fiip.
mafler of modern times, provided with a compass, can
well commit. The length of the Mediterranean mea.
fured, in degrees of longitude, from the Pillars of
Hercules, to the Bay of Issus, is eIfs than forty de-
grees but in Ptolemy's maps it is more than sixty,
and, in general, his longitudes, counting from the
meridian of Alexandria, especially toward the East,
are erroneous nearly in the fame proportion. It ap-
pears, indeed, that in remote seas, the coasts were
often delineated from an imperfet account of the dif-
tances failed, without the least knowledge of the bear-
ings or direcion of the (hip's course. Ptolemy, it is
true, used to make an allowance of about one-third
for the winding of a (hip's course. Geogr. lib. i. c. 12.;
but it is plain, that the application of this general
rule could seldom lead to an accurate conclusion. Of
this there is a firiking instance in the form which that
geographer has given to the Peninsula of India. From
the Barygazenum Promontorium to the place marked
Locus undc folvunt in Chryfen navigantes, that is,
from Surat on the Malabar coast, to about Narfapour
on the Coromandel coast, the distance measured along
the fea-flore is nearly the fame with what it is in rea-
lity that is, about five hundred and twenty lcagues.

But

But the mistake in the direction is astonishing, for the
Malabar and Coromandel coast, initead of stretching
to the south, and interfeaing one another at Cape Co-
morin, in a very acute angle, are extended by Ptolemy
almost in the fame straight line from weft to east, de-
clining a little to the south. This coast is, at the fame
time, marked with several bays and promontories,
nearly resembling, in their position, those which acau-
ally exist on it. Alr these circumstances compared to-
gether, point out very clearly what were the materials
from which the ancient map of India was compoe('d.
The ships which had visited the coast of that country,
had kept an account of the time which they took to
fail from one place to ancther, and had marked, as
they stood along shore, on what hand the land lay,
when they ihaped their course across a bay, or doubled
a promontory. This imperfect journal, with an inac-
curate account, perhaps, of the latitude of one or two
places, was probably all the information concerning
the coast of India, which Ptolemy was able to pro-
cure. That he should have been able to procure no
better information from merchants who failed with no
particular view of exploring the coast, will not appear
wonderful, if we confider that even the celebrated Pe-
riplus of Hanno would not enable a geographer to lay
down the coast of Africa with more precision, than
Ptolemy has delineated that of India.

THIE introduction of the'filk-worm into Europe, and
the effets which this produced, came under the view

of

of Mr. Gibbon, in writing the history of the Emperor
Justinian, and thoughit was an incident of subordinate
importance only, amidst the multiplicity of great tranf-
aaions which must have occupied his attention, he
has examined this event with an accuracy, and related
it with a precision, which would have done honour to
an author who had no higher objec of research.

THIS voyage, together with the observations of Abu

Zeid al Hafan of Siraf, was published by M. Renau-
dot, A. D. 1718, under the title of " Anciennes Rela-
t" tions des Indes, et de la Chine, de deux Voyageurs
( Mlahometans, qui y allerent dans le Neuvieme Siecle
" traduites de Arabe, avec des remarques fur les prin-

,' cipaux endroits de ces Relations." As M. Renaudot,
in his remarks, reprefcnts the literature and police of
the Chinese, in colours very different from those of the
splendid descriptions which a blind admiration had
prompted the Jefults to publish, tw.o zealous miifion-
aries have called in question the authenticity of these
Relations, and.have asserted that the authors of them

-Ld never becn in China; P. Premare Lettr. edifiantes

tom. xxi. p. 158, &c. Some doubts concerning their

authen-

authenticity were entertained likewise by several learned
men in England, on account of M. Renaudot's having
given no notice of the manuscript which he translated,
but that he found it in the library of M. le Comte de
Seignelay. As no person had seen the manuscript
since that time, the doubts increased, and M. Renaudot
was charged with the crime of imposing upon the pub-
lic. But the Colbert Manuscripts having been deposited
in the King's Library, as (fortunately for literature)
most private colletions are in France, M. de Guignes,
after a long search, discovered the identical manu-
script to which M. Renaudot refers. It appears to
have been written in the twelfth century; Journal
des Scavans, Dec. 1764, p. 315, &c. As I had not
the French edition of M. Renaudot's book, my refer-
ences are made to the English translation. The Rela-
tion of the two Arabian Travellers is confirmed, in
many points, by their countryman Maffoudi, who
published his treatise on universal history, to which he
gives the fantastical title of " Meadows of Gold, and
" Mines of Jewels," a hundred and fix years after
their time. From him, likewise, we receive such an
account of India in the tenth century, as renders it
evident that the Arabians had then acquired an exten-
five knowledge of that country. According to his de-
scription, the peninsula of India was divided into four
kingdoms. The first was composed of the provinces
situated on the Indus, and the rivers which fall into it;
the capital of which was Moultan. The capital of the
second kingdom was Canoge, which, from the ruins of
it still remaining, appears to have been a very large
city; Rennell's Memoirs, p. 54. In order to give an

idea

idea of its populousness, the Indian historians assert,
that it contained thirty thousand shops, in which betel-
nut was fold, and sixty thousand sets of musicians and
fingers, who paid a tax to government; Ferifhta, tranf-
lated by Dow, vol. i. p. 32. The third kingdom was
Cachemire. Maffoudi, as far as I know, is the first
author who mentions this paradise of India, of which
he gives a Short but just description. The fourth is
the kingdom of Guzerate, which he represents as the
greatest and most powerful; and he concurs with the
two Arabian Travellers, in giving the sovereigns of it
the appellation of Balllara. What M\affoudi relates
concerning India is more worthy of notice, as he him.
seif had visited that country; Notices et Extraits des
Manuferits de la Bibliotheque du Roi, tom. i. p. 9, io.
Maffioudi confirms what the two Arabian Travellers re-
late, concerning the extraordinary progress of the
Indians in astronomical science. According to his ac-
count, a temple was built during the reign of Brahman,
the firil monarch of India, with twelve towers, repre-
senting the twelve signs of the zodiac; and in which
was delineated, a view of all the stars as they appear
in the heavens. In the fame reign was composed the
famous Sind-HInd, which seems to be the Itandard
treatise of Indian astronomy; Notices, &c. tom. i.
p. 7. Another Arabian author, who wrote about the
middle of the fourteenth century, divides India into
t!:ree parts. The northern comprehending all the pro-
vinces on the Indus. The middle, extending from
Guzerate to the Ganges. The southern, which he
denominates Comar, from Care Comorin; Notices,
&c. tom. ii. p. 46.

THE naval Dkill of the Chinese seems not to have been
superior to that of the Greeks, the Romans, or Ara-
bians. The course which they held from Canton to
Siraf, near the mouth of the Persian Gulf, is described
by their own authors. They kept as near as possible to
the shore until they reached the island of Ceylon, and
then doubling Cape Comorin, they failed along the
weft fide of the Peninsula, as far as the mouth of the
Indus, and thence steered along the coast to the place
of their destination; Mem. de Literat. tom. xxxii.
p. 367. Some authors have contended, that both the
Arabians and Chinese were well acquainted with the
mariners compass, and the use of it in navigation; but
it is remarkable that in the Arabic, Turkish, and Per-
fian languages there is no original name for the com-
pass. They commonly call it Bo.ola, the Italian name,
which shews that the knowledge of this useful inftru-
ment was communicated to them by the Europeans.
There is not one single observation, of ancient date,
made by the Arabians on the variation of the needle,
or any inftru&ion deduced from it, for the assistance
of navigators. Sir John Chardin, one of the most
learned and heft informed travellers who has visited
the East, having been consulted upon this point, returns
for answer, " I boldly aflert, that the Asiatics are be-
" holden to us for this wonderful ilftrument, which

they had from Europe a long time before the Portu-

" guefe conqnefts. For, first, their compasses are ex-
" a&ly like ours, and they buy them of Europeans as

cc c W much

" much as they can, scarce daring to meddle with their
" needlesthemfelves. Secondly, It is certain that the
" old navigators only coasted it along, which I impute
" to their want of this infirument to guide and in-
" ftruct them in the middle of the ocean. We can-
"not pretend to fay that they were afraid of venturing
" far from home, for the Arabians, the first naviga-

tors in the world, in my opinion, at least for the

, Eftern seas, have, time out of mind, failed from

" the bottom of the Red Sea, all along the coast of
i Africa; and the Chinese have always traded with
" Java and Sumatra, which is a very considerable voy-
" age. So many islands uninhabited and yet produc-
" tive, so many lands unknown to the people I speak
C of, are a proof that the old navigators had not the
" art of failing on the main sea. I have nothing but

argument to offer touching this matter, having never

" met with any person in Pcrfia or the Indies to in-
' form me when the compass was first known among
' them, though I made inquiry of the most learned
" men in both countries. I have failed from the Indies
' to Persia in Indian ships, when no European has
" been aboard but myself. The pilots were all In-
: dians, and they used the fore-ftaff and quadrant for

their observations. These instruments they have

" from us, and made by our artists, and they do not
" in the least vary from ours, except that the charac-
" ters are Arabic. The Arabians are the most skilful

navigators of all the Asiatics or Africans; but nei-

" ther they nor the Indians make use of charts; and
" they do not much want them: some they have, but
"' they are copied from ours, for they are altogether

ignorant of perfpecive." Inquiry when the Maho-

SOME learned men, Cardan, Scaliger, &c. have
imagined that the Vafa Murrhina, particularly described
by Pliny, Nat. Hist. lib. xxxvii. and occasionally men-
tioned by several ancient authors both Greek and Ro-

Bland and M. Larcher have examined this opinion,
with full as much industry and erudition as the subjet
merited, in two Dissertations published in Mem. de Li-
terat. tom. xliii. From them it is evident that the
Vafa Murrhina were formed of a transparent stone, dug
out of the earth in some of the Eastern provinces of
Asia. These were imitated in vessels of coloured
glass. As both were beautiful and rare, they were
fold at a very high price to the luxurious citizens of

in his mind; nor c:n citkcr the Catholic or Protestant
miflionarics in India boast of having overcome thefc
prejudices, except among a few in the lowest cafls,
or of such as have lois their cast altogether. This
last circumstance is a great obitacle to the progress of
Chriflianity in India. As Europeans eat the flefli of

intoxicating liquors, in which practices they are imi-

so sensible of this, that they affected to imitate the

which shew that the resort of Europeans to Egypt had
ceased, almost entirely, for some time. Prior to the
seventh and eighth centuries, the greater part of the
public deeds in Italy, and in other countries of Europe,
were written upon paper fabricated of the Egyptian
Papyrus; but after that period, as Europeans seldom
ventured to trade in Alexandria, almost all chatters
and other deeds are written upon parchment. Murat.

between the Christians and Mahomedans so fully, in
order to corrcct an error into which several modern au-

into its ancient channels, and the merchants of Europe
resorted with the fame freedom as formerly to the ports

CAFFA is the most commodious tation for trade in

continues to be a place of considerable trade. Sir

NEITHER Jovius, the professed panegyrist of the

explain the nature of the trade by which it was ac-
quired. Even hMachiavel, whose genius delighted
in the investigation of every circumstance which
contributed to aggrandize or depress nations, seems

not

not to have viewed the commerce of his country as a
fubje& that merited any elucidation. Denina, who has
entitled the firlt chapter of his eighteenth book,
, The Origin of the Medici, and the Commencement
c of their Power and Grandeur," furnishes little in-
formation with regard to the trade carried on by them.
This silence of so many authors is a proof that hifto-
rians had not yet begun to view commerce as an objec
of such importance in the political Itate of nations, as
to enter into any detail concerning its nature and effeas.
From the references of different writers to Scipio Am-

LEIBNITZ has preserved a curious paper, containing

the instruCtions of the republic of Florence to the two
ambassadors sent to the Soldan of Egypt, in order to
negotiate this treaty with him, together with the re-
port of these ambassadors on their return. The great
object of the republic was, to obtain liberty of trading
in all parts of the Soldan's dominions, upon the fame
terms with the Venetians. The chief privileges which
they solicited, were; i. A perfea freedom of admif-
sion into every port belonging to the Soldan, prote&ion
while they continued in it, and liberty of departure

at

at what time they chose. 2. Permiflion to have a
coniui, with the fame rights and jurifdition as those
of the Venetians; and liberty to build a church. a
v.irehoufc, and a bath, in every place where they set-
ricd. 3. That they should not pay for goods imported
or exported higher duties than were paid by the Vene-
cians. 4. That the effets of any Florentine who died
in the dominions of the Soldan should be consigned to
the consul. 5. That the gold and silver coin of Flo-
rence should be received in payments. All these pri-
riege s (which shew on what equal and liberal terms
Christians and Mahomedans now carried on trade) the
Florentines obtained; but from the causes mentioned

THL Eastern paits of Asia are now so completely

e.plorcd, that the first imperfect accounts of them, by
Marco Polo, attrac little of that attention which was
originally excited by the publication of his travels;
and some circumstances in his narrative have induced
difficrent authors to jullify this neglct, by calling in
question the truth of what he relates, and even to as-
fert that he had never visitcd those countries which he
pretends to dtfcribe. He does not, fay they, afcertaiti
the position of any one place, by specifying its longi-
tude or latitude. He gives names to provinces and
cit;es, particularly in his description of Cathay, which
have no resemblance to those which they now bear.
We may observe, however, that as Marco Polo seems

to

to have been, in no degree, a man of science, it was
not to be expefted that he should fix the position of
places with geographical accuracy. As he travelled
through China, either in the suite of the great Khan,
or in execution of his orders, it is probable that the
names wnich he gives to different provinces and cities,
are those by which they were known to the Tartars,
in whose service he was, not their original Chinese
names. Some inaccuracies which have been observed
in the relation of his travels, may be accounted for,
by attending to one circumstance, that it was not pub-
lifhed from a regular journal, which, perhaps, the
vicissitudes in his situation, during such a long fcries
of adventures, did not permit him to keep, or to pre-
serve. It was composed after his return to his native
country, and chiefly from recollection. But notwith-
standing this disadvantage, his account of those re-
gions of the East, towards which my inquiries have
been direted, contains information with refpet to
several particulars, altogether unknown in Europe at
that time, the accuracy of which is now fully con-
firmed. Mr. Marfden, whose accuracy and discern-
ment are well known, traces his description of the
island which he calls Java minor, evidently Sumatra;
from which it is apparent that, as Marco Polo had re-
fided a considerable time in that island, he had exa-
mined some parts with care, and had inquired with
diligence concerning others. Hilt. of Sumat. p. 281.
I shall mention some other particulars with refped to
India, which, though they relate to matters of no great
consequence, afford the best proof of his having visitcd
these countries, and of his having observed the man-
ziers and customs of the people with attention. He

4 ;ives

gives a diftin&t account of the nature and preparation of
Sago, the principal article of fubfiflence among all the
nations of Malayan race, and he brought the first fpe.
cimen of this singular production to Venicc, Ramus.
lib. iii. c. z6. He takes notice, likewise, of the gene-
ral custom of chewing Betel, and his description of
the mode of preparing it is the fame with that itill
in use. Ramus. Viaggi, i. p. 55. D. 56. B. He even
descends into such detail as to mention the peculiar
manner of feeding horses in India, which frill conti-
nues. Ramus. p. 53. F. What is of greater import-
ance, we learn from him, that the trade with Alex-
andria continued when he travelled through India, to
be carried on in the fame manner as I conjectured it to
have been in ancient times. The commodities of the
East were Rill brought to the Malabar coast by vessels
of the country, and conveyed thence, together with
pepper, and other produtions peculiar to that part of
India, by flips which arrived from the Red Sea.
Lib. iii. c. 27. This, perhaps, may account for the
superior quality which Sanudo ascribes to the goods
brought to the coast of Syria from the Persian Gulf,
above those imported into Egypt by the Red Sea. The
former were chosen and purchased in the places where
they grew, or where they were manufactured, by the
merchants of Persia, who fill continued their voyages
to every part of the East; while the Egyptian mer-
chants, in making up their cargoes, depended upon
the aflortment of goods brought to the Malabar coast
by the natives. To some persons in his own age, what
Marco Polo related concerning the numergus armies
and immense revenues of the Eastern princes, appeared
so extravagant, (though perfectly consonant to what we

2 now

now know concerning the population of China, and
the wealth of Indoftan,) that they gave him the name
of AIMfr Alarco Milioni. Prefat. de Ramus. p. 4.
But among persons better informed, the reception he
met with was very different. Columbus, as well as the
men of science with whom he corresponded, placed
such confidence in the veracity of his relations, that
upon them, the speculations and theories, which led to
the discovery of the New World, were in a great mea-
sure founded. Life of Columbus by his Son, c. 7,

public-fpirited effort of the citizens, in order to sup-
port their country at a dangerous crisis. Of such laud-
able exertions, there are several striking instances in
the history of the republic. In the year 1379, when
the Genoese, after obtaining a great naval vi&ory over

citizens, by a voluntary contribution, enabled the fe-

Two facts may be mentioned as proofs of an extra-

ordinary catenlon of the Venetian trade at this period.
-i. There is in Rymer's Great Collection, a series
of grants from the kings of England, of various pri-
vileges and immunities to Venetian merchants trading
in England, as well as several commercial treaties with
the republic, which plainly indicate a considerable in-
crease of their tranfadions in that country. These are
mentioned in their order by Mr. Anderson, to whose

patient

patient industry and found understanding, every person
engaged in any commercial research must have felt
himself greatly indebted on many occasions.-- 2. The
establishment of a Bank by public authority, the credit
of which was founded on that of the state. In an age
and nation so well acquainted with the advantages
which commerce derives from the inffitution of banks,
it is unneceflary to enumerate them. Mercantile tranf-
a&ions must have been numerous and extensive before
the utility of such an institution could be fully per-
ceived, or the principles of trade could be Co fully un-
derftood as to form the regulations proper for conduct-
ing it with fucccfs. Venice may boast of having given
the first example to Europe of an eftablilhment alto-
gether unknown to the ancients, and which is the pride
of the modern commercial system. The constitution
of the Bank of Venice was originally founded on such
just principles, that it has served as a model in the cfa-
blifhment of banks in other countries, and the admini-
ftration of its affairs has been conducted with so much
integrity, that its credit has never been shaken. I can-
not specify the precise year in which the Bank of Ve-
nice was established by a law of the State. Anderson
ftippofes it to have been A.D. 1157. Chron. Dednt.

AN Italian author of good credit, and a diligent in-

quirer into the ancient hiitory of its different govern-
ments, affirms, that if the several States which traded

in

in the Mediterranean had united together, Venice alone
would have been superior to them all, in naval power,
and in extent of commerce. Denina Revolutions
d'Italie traduits par l'Abbe Jardin, lib. xviii. c. 6.
tom. vi. p. 339. About the -ear 1420, the Doge
Mocenigo gives a view of the naval force of the repub-
lie, which confirms this decision of Denina. At that
time it consisted of three thousand trading velfels, of
various dimensions, on board which were employed
seventeen thousand sailors; of three hundred lhips of
greater force, manned by eight thousand sailors; and
of forty-five large galeafles, or carracks, navigated by
cievcn thousand sailors. In public and private arsenals
fxtcen thousand carpenters were employed. Mar. Sa-

WIENs we take a view of the form and position of

the habitable parts of Afra and Africa, we will fee good
rcafons for confidering the camel as the most useful
of ail the animals over which the inhabitants of these
great continents have acquired dominion. In both,
some of the most fertile diftrias are separated from each
other by such extensive tracts of barren sands, the feats
of desolation and drought, as seem to exclude the pof-
fibility of communication between them. But as the
ocean, which appears, at firit view, to be placed as an
insuperable barrier between different regions of the
earth, has been rendered, by navigation, subservient
to their mutual intercourse; so, by means of the camel,

which

which the Arabians emphatically call The Ship of the
Desert, the most dreary waRes are traversed, and the
nations which they disjoin are enabled to trade with
one another. Those painful journies, impracticable by
any other animal, the camel performs with afbonifhing
ilifpatch. Under heavy burdens of fix, fcven, and
eight hundred weight, they can continue their march
during a long period of time, with little food or reft,
and sometimes without talting water for eight or nine
days. By the wife ceconomy of Providence, the camel
seems formed of purpose to be the beaR of burden in
those regions where he is placed, and where his ser-
vice is most wanted. In all the diftriCs of Asia and
Africa, where deserts are molt frequent and extensive,
the camel abounds. This is his proper station, and
beyond this the sphere of his activity does not extend
far. He dreads alike the excesses of heat and of cold, 0
and does not agree even with the mild climate of our
temperate zone. As the first trade in Indian com-
modities, of which we have any authentic account,
was carried on by means of camels, Genesis, xxxvii.
25, and as it is by employing them that the convey-
ance of these commodities has been so widely extended
over Alia and Africa, the particulars which I have
mentioned concerning this fingulLr animal appeared to
me necefiary towards illustrating this part of my sub-
jet. If any of my readers defirc more full intorna-
tion, and wish to know how the ingenuity and art of
man have secondcd the intentions of Nature, in train-
ing the camel, from his birth, for that life of exertion
and hardship to which he is destined, he may consult
lliftoire Naturelle, by M. le Comtc de Buffon, artic.
Chunear et Diromicaiire, one of the mout eloquent, and,

D D as

a far as I can judge from examining the authorities
which he has quoted, one of the most accurate, de-
scriptions given by that celebrated writer. M. Volney,
whole accuracy is well known, gives a description of
the manner in which the camel performs its journeys,
which may be agreeable to some of my readers. " In
" travelling through the desert, camels are chiefly
" employed, because they consume little, and carry a
c great load. His ordinary burden is about seven
" hundred and fifty pounds; his food, whatever is

i given him, tfraw, thistles, the stones of dates, beans,

c" barley, &c. With a pound of food a-day, and as
" much water, he will travel for weeks. In the jour-
" ney from Cairo to Suez, which is forty or forty-fix
" hours, they neither eat nor drink; but these long
cc fasts, if often repeated, wear them out. Their

uc usual rate of travelling is very flow, hardly above

" two miles an hour; it is vain to puth them, they
" will not quicken their pace, but, if allowed some
cc short reft, they will travel fifteen or eighteen hours
c a-day." Voyage, toni. ii. p. 383.

1.: order to give an adequate idea of the extenfdve

circulation of Indian commodities by land-carriage, it
would be neceflary to trace the route, and to estimate
the number, of the various caravans by which they are
conveyed. Could this be executed with accuracy, it
would be a curious funjet of geographical research, as
well as a valuable addition to commercial history.
Though it is inconsistent with the brevity which I have

uni-

uniformly studied in condu&ing this Disquisition, to
enter into a detail of so great length, it may be proper
here, for illustrating this part of my subjea, to tale
such a view of two caravans which visit Mecca, as may
enable my readers to estimate more justly the magnitude
of their commercial tranfaaQions. The first is the ca-
ravan which takes its departure from Cairo in Egypt,
and the other from Damascus in Syria ; and I select
these, both because they are the most considerable,
and because they are described by authors of undoubted
credit, who had the best opportunities of receiving full
information concerning them. The former is composed
not only of pilgrims from every part of Egypt, but of
those which arrive from all the small Mahomedan itates
on the African coast of the Mediterranean, from the em-
pire of Morocco, and even from the Negroe kingdoms
on the Atlantic. When anfembled, the caravan consists
at least of fifty thousand persons, and the number of
camels employed in carrying water, provisions, and
merchandize, is fill greater. The journey, which, in
going from Cairo, and returning thither, is not com-
pleted in less than a hundred days, is performed wholly
by land; and as the route lies mostly through sandy
deserts, or barren uninhabited wilds, which seldom as-
ford any fubfiflence, and where often no sources of
water can be found, the pilgrims always undergo much
fatigue, and sometimes must endure incredible hard-
(hips. An early and good description of this caravan
is publifled by Hakluyt, vol. ii. p. 202, &c. Maillet
has entered into a minute and curious detail with regard
to it; Defcript. de l'Egypte, part ii. p. 212, &c. Pocock
has given a route, together with the length of each
day's march, which he received from a person who

n 2 bad

had been fourteen times at Mecca, vol. i. pp. 188.
261, &c.-The caravan from Damascus, composed of
pilgrims from almost every province of the Turkilh
empire, is little inferior to the former in number, and
the commerce which it carries on is hardly less valu-
able. Voyage de Volney, tom. ii. p. 251, &c.

&c. This pilgrimage was performed in the year 1741,
by Khojeh Abdulkurreem, whom I formerly mentioned,
Note V. p. 343. He gives the usual route from Da-
mafcus to Mecca, cc;mputcd by hours, the common
mode of reckoning a journey in the East through coun-
tries little frequented. According to the most mode-
rate efLimate, the distance between the two cities, by
his account, must be above a thousand miles; a great
part of the journey is through a desert, and the pil-
grims not only endure much fatigue, but are often
exposed to great danger from the wild Arabs. Me-
moirs, p. 114, &c. It is a singular proof of the pre-
datory spirit of the Arabs, that although all their inde-
pendent tribes are zealous Mahomedans, yet they
make no scruple of plundering the caravans of pilgrims,
while engaged in performing one of the most iidifpenf-
able duties of theirreligion. Aremarkableinftance of this
occurred in the year 757. Travels through Cyprus,
Syria, &c. by Abbe IMariti, vol. ii. p. 1 17, &c. Engl.
Tranfation. Great as these caravans are, we must not
suppose that all the pilgrims who visit Mecca belong
to them; such confilderable additions are received from
the extensive dominions of Portia, from every province
of Indoftan, and the countries to the East of it, from
Abyffilia, fr om various fiates on the Southern coast of
Africa, and from all parts of Arabia, that when the

whole

whole are assembled they have been computed to
amount to two hundred thousand. In some years the
number is farther increased by small bands of pilgrims
from several interior provinces of Africa, the names
and situations of which are just beginning to be known
in Europe. For this last fa& we are indebted to the
Association for promoting the Discovery of the Interior
Parts of Africa, formed by some British Gentlemen,
upon principles so liberal, and with views so public-
spirited, as do honour to themselves and to their
country. Proceedings, &c. p. 174.

IN the Report of the Committee of the Privy Council

on the Slave Trade, other particulars are contained;
and it appears that the commerce carried on by caravans
in the interior parts of Africa is not only widely ex-
tended, but of confderable value. Besides the great
caravan which proceeds to Cairo, and is joined by
Mahomedan pilgrims from every part of Africa, there
are caravans which have no objea but commerce,
which set out from Fez, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and
other fates on the sea coast, and penetrate far into
the interior country. Some of them take no less than
fifty days to reach the place of their destination ; and,
as the medium of their rate of travelling may be efti-
mated at about eighteen miles a-day, the extent of their
journey ma:y be easily computed. As both the time of
their outset, and their route, are known, they are met
by the people of all the countries through which they
travel, who trade with them. Indian goods of every
kind form a conGderable article in this traffic, in ex-
change for which the chief commodity they can give is
Saves. Part vi.

DD 3 As

As the journeys of the caravans, which are purely

commercial, do not commence at stated seasons, and
their routes vary according to the convenience or fancy
of the merchants of whom they are compoied, a de-
scription cannot be given of them with the fame degree
of accuracy as of the great caravans which visit Mecca.
But by attending to the accounts of some authors, and
the occasional hints of others, sufficient information
mnay be gathered to satisfy us, that the circulation of
Eaflern goods by these caravans is very extensive. The
fame intercourse which was anciently kept up by the
provinces in the North-east of Asia with Indofian and
China, and which I formerly described, still subsists.
Among all the numerous tribes of Tartars, even of
those which retain their pastoral manners in greatelt
purity, the demand for the production, of these two
countries is very considerable. Voyages de Pallas,
tom. i. p. 357, &c. torn. ii. P. . 4. In rder to sup-
ply them with these, caravans set out annually from
Boghar, (Hackluyt, vol. i. p. 232.) Samaircand, Thi-
bet, and several other places, and return with large
cargoes of Indian and Chinese goods. But the trade
carried on between Russia and China, in this part of
Asia, is by far the most extenlive and best known.
Some connexion of this kind, it is probable, was kept
up between them from the earlieit period, but it in-
creased greatly after the interior parts of Ruftia were
rendered more accessible by the conquests of Zingis
Khan and Tamerlane. The commercial nations of
Europe were so well acquainted with the mode of car-
rying on this trade, that soon after the Portuguese had
opened the communication with the Eaf. by the Cape
of Good Hope, an attenlpt was made, in order to di-

rnini;l

minifh the advantages which they derived from this
discovery, to prevail on the Ruffians to convey Indian
and Chinese commodities through the whole extent of
their empire, partly by land-carriage and partly by
means of navigable rivers, to some port on the Baltic,
from which they might be distributed through every
part of Europe. Ramufio Raccolto da Viaggi, vol. i.
p. 374. B. Hist. du Commerce de la Rullie, par M.
Schreder, tom. i. p. 13, 14. This scheme, too great for
the monarch then on the throne of Russia to carry into
execution, was rendered pracicable by the conquests of
Ivan Bafilowitz, and the genius of Peter the Great.
Though the capitals of the two empires were situated
at the immense ditlance of fix thousand three hundred
and feventy-eight miles from each other, and the route
lay for above four hundred miles through an unin-
habited desert, (Bell's Travels, vol. ii. p. 167.) cara-
vans travelled from the one to the other. But though
it had been stipulated, when this ilutercourfe was efta-
blifhed, that the number of persons in each caravan
fnould not exceed two hundred, and though they were
{hut up within the walls of a Caravanserai during the
short time they were suffered to remain in Pekin, and
were allowed to deal only with a few merchants, to
whom a monopoly of the trade with them had been
granted; yet, notwithstanding all these restraints and
precautions, the jealous vigilance with which the Chi.
nefe government excludes foreigners from a free inter-
course with its fubjeds, was alarmed, and the admission
of the Ruffian caravans into the empire was soon pro-
hibited. After various negotiations, an expedient was
at length devised, by which the advantages of mutual
commerce were secured, without infringing the cau-

D D4 tious

tious arrangements of Chinese policy. On the bound-
ary of the two empires, two small towns were built
almost contiguous, Kiachta inhabited by Ruffians,
and Maimatfchin by Chinese. To these ail the mar-
ketable producions of their respective countries are
brought by the fubjccs of each empire ; and the furs,
the linen and woollen cloth, the leather, the glass, &c.
of Russia, are exchanged for the silk, the cotton, the tea,
the rice, the toys, &c. of China. By some well-judged
conceflions of the sovereign now feated on the throne
of Russia, whose enlarged mind is superior to the illi-
beral maxims of many of her prcdeceffors, this trade is
rendered so flcurilhing, that its amount annually is not
less than eight hundred thousand pounds sterling, and
it is the or ly trade which China carries on alnoft en-
tirely by barter. Mr. Coxe, in his account of the Ruf.
F. n difcovcries, has colilctcd, with his usual attention
and discernment, every thing relative to this branch of
trade, the nature and extent of which were little known
in Europe. Part ii. clap. ii, iii, iv. Nor is Kiachta
the only place where Russia receives Chinese and In-
dian commodities. A confiderablc supply of both is
brought by caravans of independent Tartars to Oren-
burg, on the river Jaik; Voyage de Pallas, tom. i.
p. 355, &c. to Troitzkaia, on the river Oui, and to
other places which I might mention. I have entered
into this long detail concerning the mode in which the
productions in India and China are circulated through
Russia, as it affords the most ltriking instance, I know,
of the great extent to which valuable commodities may
bc conveyed by land-carriage.

THE only voyage of discovery in the Atlantic Ocean

towards the South, by any of the ancient commercial
fates in the Mediterranean, is that of Hanno, under-
taken by order of the republic of Carthage. As the
situation of that city, so much nearer the Straits than
Tyre, Alexandria, and the other feats of ancient trade
which have been mentioned, gave it more immediate
access to the ocean; that circumstance, together with
the various fettlcments which the Carthaginians had
made in different provinces of Spain, naturally fug-
gested to them this enterprise, and afforded them the
profpet of considerable advantages from its success.
The voyage of Hanno, instead of invalidating, seems to
confirm the justness of the reasons which have been
given, why no similar attempt was made by the other
commercial states in the Mediterranean.

THouGH the intelligent authors whom I have quoted

confidered this voyage of the Phenicians as fabulous,
Herodotus mentions a circumstance concerning it,
which seems to prove that it had really been performed.
"c The Phenicians," fays he, " affirmed that, in fail-
" ing round Africa, they had the fun on their right

hand, which to me appears not to be credible,

" though it may he deemed so by others." Lib. iv.
c, 42. This, it is certain, must have happened, if they

really

re?.!!y accomplished such a voyage. The science of
aflronomy, however, was in that early period so im-
rerfztl, that it was by experience only that the Phe-
rsnians could come at the knowledge of this fat;
they durfl not, without this, have ventured to assert what
would have appeared to be an improbable fiftion. Even
after what they related, Herodotus disbelieved it.

NOT'ITHSTANDING this increasing demand for the

produdions of India, it is remarkable, that during the
sixteenth century some commodities which are now
the chief articles of importation from the East, were
either altogether unknown, or of little account. Tea,
the importation of which, at present, far exceeds that
of any other production of the East, has not been in
general use, in any country of Europe, a full century;
and yet, during that short period, from some singular
carire of taste, or power of fashion, the infusion of a
lcaf brought from the farthelt extremity of the earth,
f lwhich it is perhaps the highest praise to fay that it
;. innoxicus, has become almost a neceflary of life in
Ceveral parts of Europe, and the pallion for it descends
from the most e!cvated to the lowcet orders in society.
In 1785 it was computed thatt the whole quantity of
tea imported into Lurope fro nl China was about nine-
teen millions of pounds, of .which it is conjecured that
rwelve miilions were consumed in Great Britain and
the dominions depending upon it. Dodflev's Annual
Regiftcr for 1784 and 1785, p. .

I . In 1789twenty-
rne millons of poinds were -mpor:cd. The porcelain

Ii of

qs China, now as common in many parts of Europe
as if it were of dQmeftic manufacture, was not known
to the ancients. Marco Polo is the first among the
moderns who mentions it. The Portuguese began to
import it not long after their firit voyage to China,
A. D. 151 7 ; but it was a considerable time before the
use of it became extensive.

ACCORDING to all the writers of antiquity, the In.

dians are said to be divided into seven tribes or casts.
Strabo, lib. xv. p. 1029. C. &c. Diod. Sicul. lib. ii.
p. 153, &c. Arrian. Indic. c. io. They were led into
this error, it is probable, by confidering some of the sub-
divisions of the calts, as if they had been a diftina in-
dependent order. But that there were no more than
four original casts we learn from the concurrent tef-
timony of the bell informed modern travellers. A
mol diftin& account of these we have in " La Porte
"c Ouverte, ou la vrayc Representation de la Vie,
"' des Mceurs, de la Religion, et du Service des Bra-
' mines, qui derreurent fur les Costes de Chosomandel,"
&c. This was compiled before the middle of last cen-
tury, by Abraham Roger, chaplain of the Dutch sac-
tory at Pullicate. By gaining the confidence of an
intelligent Brahmin, he acquired information concerning
the manners and religion of the Indians, more authen-
tic and extensive than was known to Europeans prior
t6 the late translations from tlhe Sanfkreet language.
I mention this book, because it seems to be less known
than it deserves to be. There remains now no doubt

with

with refpec either to the number or the funrtions of
the cafls, as both are ascertained from the mos an-
cient and sacred books of the Hindoos, and confirmed
by the accounts of their own inflitutions, given by
Brahmins eminent for their learning. According to
them, the different carts proceeded froml Brahma, the
immediate agent of the creation under the Supreme
Power, in the following manner, which establishes
both the rank which they were to hold, and the office
which they were required to perform.
The Brahmin, from the mouth (wisdom): To pray,

to read, to inrtruct.
The CEl:teree, from the arms (ftrcngh): To draw

the bow, to fight, to govern.
The Bite, from the belly or thighs (nourishment): To

provide the necessaries of life by agriculture and
traffic.
Tile S&eir, from the feet (fubjcction): To labour,

to fervc.

THE prescribed occupations of all theft classes are

cefen:ial in a well-regulated state. Subordinate to
them is a fifth, or adventitious class, denominated Bur-
run Sun;er, supposed to be the offspring of an unlawful
union between persons of different casts. These are
moitly dealers in petty articles of retail trade. Preface
to the Code of Gentoo Laws, p. xlvi. and xcix. This
adventitious cafl is not mentioned, as far as I know, by
any European author. The diftinEion was too nice
to be obfcrved by them, and they seem to confider the
r;m,-nbrs of this cast, as belonging to the Sooder.

7 Bcfidcs

Besides these acknowledged casts, there is a race of
unhappy men, denominated, on the Coromandel coast,
Pariars, and, in other parts of India, Chandalas. These
are out-casts from their original order, who, by their
misconduct, have forfeited all the pritileges of it.
Their condition is, undoubtedly, the lowest degradation
of human nature. No person of any cast will have
the least communication with them. Sonncrat, tom. i.
p. 55, 56. If a Pariar approach a Nayr, i. e. a warrior
of high cast, on the Malabar coast, he may put him to
death with impunity. Water or milk are confidered
as defiled even by their shadow passing over them, and
cannot be used until they are purified. Ayeen Akbery,
vol. iii. p. 243. It is almost imposSible for words to
express the sensation of vileness that the name of Pariar
or Chandala conveys to the mind of a Hindoo. Every
Hindoo who violates the rules or institutions of his
cast finks into this degraded situation. This it is which
renders I-indoos so resolute in adhering to the infti-
tutions of their tribe, because the loss of cait is, to
them, the loss of all human comfort and refipeability;
and is a punifhmenlt, beyond compa:iifon, more severe
than excommunication, in the moil t;iumphlant period
of Papal power.

THE mention of one circumstance rcfpeCting tle

diftinclion of carls has bcen omitted in the text.
Though the line of reparation be so drawn, as to render
the ascent from an inferior to a higher car absolutely im-
pofflble, and it would be regarded as a most enormous
impiety, if one in a lower order should presume to
perform any function belonging to those of a superior
calt i yet, in ccrtain cafes, the Pundits decllre it to be
lawful for persons of a high class to exercise some of
the occupations allotted to a class below their own,
without lofng their cart by doing so. Pref. of Pundits
to the Code of Gentoo Laws, p. ico. Accordingly
we find Brahmins employed in the service of their
princes, not only as ministers of state, Orme's Frag-
ments, p. 207, but in subordinate stations. Moll of
the officers of high rank in the army of Sevagi, t!c
founder of the Mahratta slate, were Brahmins, and
some of them Pundits or learned Brahmins. Ibid.
p. 97. Hurry Punt and Purferam Bhow, who com-
manded the Mahratta forces, which acted in con-
junclion with the army of Lord Cornwallis againf
Tippoo Saib, were Brahmins. Many Seapoys in the
fervic of the East India Company, particularly in the
Bengal presidency, are of the Brahminl cart.

ANOTHER fact concerning the cafls deserves notice.

An immense number of pilgrims, amounting, in some
years, to more than Ij5,cao, visit the Pagoda of Jig-
gernaut, in Oriff., (one of the most ancient and moR
revered places of Hindoo worship,) at the time of :ie
annual festival in honour of the deity to whom the
temple is consecrated. The members of all the four
calls are alkuled promiscuously to approach the altar

of

of the idol, and feating themselves without diftinQion,
cat indiscriminately of the fame food. This seems to
indicate some remembrance of a state prior to the
inititution of casts, when all men were confidered as
equal. I have not such information as enables me to
account for a practice so repugnant to the first ideas
and principles of the Hindoos, either sacred or civil.

SOME of my readers must have observed, that I have

not mentioned the numerous orders of Indian devotees,
to all of whom European writers give the appellation
of Faquirs; a name by which the Mahomedans dif-
tinguifh fanatical monks of their own religion. The
light in which I have viewed the religious inltitutions
of the Hindocs, did not render it neceflary that I should
confider the Indian Faquirs particularly. Their num-
ber, the rigour of their mortifications, the excruciating
penances which they voluntarily undergo, and the
high opinion which the people entertain of their fanc-
tity, have struck all travellers who have vifted India,
and their descriptions of them are well known. The
powerful influence of enthufiafin, the love of
diftinaion, and the def!re of obtailing some portion
of that reverence and those honours which the Brah-
mins are born to enjoy, may account for all the ex-
traordinary things which they do and susser. One
particular concerning them merits notice. This order
of devotees appears to have been very ancient in India.
The description of the Ger:nani, which Strabo takes
from Megafthenes, applies, almost in every circum-
stance, to the modern Faquirs. Lib. xv. p. 1040. B.

NOTE LIX. p. 23.

WHAT I have afierted in the text is in general well,

founded. It is the opinion, howevcr, of gentlemen
who have seen much of India, and who obfcrved all
they saw with a discerning eye, that the conquests both
of the Mahomedans and of the Europeans have had
some effec upon the manners and customs of the na-
tives. They imagine that the dress which the Hin-
doos now wear, the turban, the jummah, and long
drawers, is an imitation of that worn by their Maho-
medan conquerors. The ancient dress of the In-
dians, as described by Arrian, Hilt. Indic. c. I6. was
a muslin cloth thrown loosely about their shoulders,
a muslin shirt reaching to the middle of the leg, and
their beards were dyed various colours; which is not
the fame with that used at present. The custom
of secluding women, and the striCtness with which
they are confined, is likewise supposed to have been in-
troduced by the Mahomedans. This supposition is in
some measure confirmed by the drama of Sacontala,
translated from the Sanfkreet. In that play, several
female characters are introduced, who mingle in so-
ciety and converse as freely with men, as women are
accustomed to do in Europe. The author, we may
presume, describes the manners, and adheres to the
customs of his own age. But while I mention this
remark, it is proper, likewise, to observe, that, from
a passage in Strabo, there is reason to think, that, in
the age of Alexander the Great, women in India were
guarded with the fame jealous attention as at present.

" When

it When their pnnces," (fays he, copying Megaf-
thenes,) " set out upon a public hunt, they are ac-
,, companied by a number of their women, but along
c the road in which they travel, ropes are stretched on
," each fide, and if any man approach near to them
" he is instantly put to death." Lib. xv. p. 1037. A.
In some parts of India, where the original manners
of the people may be supposed to subsist in greatest
purity, particularly in the high country towards the
sources of the Indus, women of rank reside in private
apartments, secluded from society. Forster's Travels,
vol. i. p. 228. Women even of the Brahmin cast ap-
pear in the streets without a veil; and it is only, as I
am informed, in the houses of persons of high rank
or great opulence that a diftin& quarter or haram is
allotted to the women. The influence of European
manners begins to be apparent among the Hindoos
who reside in the town of Calcutta. Some of them
drive about in Engliih chariots, fit upon chairs, and
furnish their houses with mirrors. Many circumstances
might be mentioned, were this the proper place, which,
it is probable, will contribute to the progress of this
spirit of imitation.

IT is amusing to observe how exacly the ideas of

an intelligent Asiatic coincide with those of the Eu-
ropeans on this subjea. " In refleting, fays he,
" upon the poverty of Turan [the countries beyond
" the Oxus] and Arabia, I was at first at a loss to
" assign a reason why these countries have never been

E " able

able to retain wealth, whillt, on the contrary, it ;s
daily increasing in Indoftan. Timour carried into
'uran the riches of Turkey, Persia, and Indoftan,
but they are all dissipated; and, during the reigns of

" the four firil Caliphs, Turkey, Persia, part of Ara-
' bia, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Spain, were their tributa-

ries; but still they were not rich. It is evident,
then, that this diflipation of the riches of a state,
m must have happened either from extraordinary drains,
" or from some defeet in the government. Indoftan

has been frequently plundered by foreign invaders,
' and not one of its kings evet gained for it any ac-

quiftion of wealth; neither has the country many

" mines of gold and silver, and yet Indoftan abounds
" in money and every other kind of wealth. The
" abundance of specie is undoubtedly owing to the
" large importation of gold and ilver in the ships of
( Europe, and other nations, many of whom bring
* ready money in exchange for the manufactrres and
", natural productions of the country. If this is net
" the cause of the prosperous fate of Indoftan, it
et mufl be owing to the peculiar blessing of God."

p. 153. This was not peculiar to India. In all the
great monarchies of the East, the sole property of land
fcems to be brested in the sovereign as lord paramount.
According to Chardin, this is the state of property in
Persia, and lands were let by the monarch to tire
farmers who cultivated them, on conditions nearly re-
fembling those granted to the Indian Ryots. Voy-
ages, tom. iii. p. 339, &c. 4to. M. Volney gives a
similar account of the tenure by which lands are held
in one of the great provinces of the Turkish empire.
Voy. en Syrie, &c. tom. ii. p. 369, &c. The precise
mode, however, in wllch the Ryots of Indolfan held
their pofleffions, is a circumstance in its ancient politi-
cal constitution, with refped to which gentlemen of
fupcrior difccrnment, who have rcfidel long in the
tountry, and filled fomc of the highest stations in go-
vernment, have formed very different opinions. Some

lave inm;gilled that grants of land were made by the
fovcreign to villages or fin:all Communitiesi the inha-
bitants of which, under tle direction of their own
chiefs or heads-meni laboured it 'n common, and di-
vidcd the prolace of it among themn in certain propor-
lions. Defcript. de l'Inde, par M. Bcrnouilli, tom. ii.

lias beeu transferred from the crown to hereditary ofi-
Crc; of great eminence and power, denominated Ze
-.:zi!,ifs, who colle& the rents fronm :ie Ryots, and
parcel out the lnds among them. Others contend,
that the office of the Zemindars is temporary and mi-
nifl.erial, that they are merely colleetors of revenue, re-
moveable at pleasure, and the tenu re by which the Ryots
hold their poffeflions is derived immediately from the
ibeoreign. This last opinion is supported with great

F. t 2 abilityi

ability, by Mr. Grant, in an Inquiry into the Nature
of Zemindary tenures in the landed property of Ben-
gal, &c. This question fill continues to be agitated
in Bengal, and such plausible arguments have been
produced in support of the different opinions, that
although it be a point extremely intercfting, as the fu-
ture system of Britiih finance in India appears likely
to hinge, in an essential degree, upon it, persons
well acquainted with the fate of India, have not been
able to form a final and fatisfaatory opinion upon
this subjea. Captain Kirkpatrick's Introd. to the In-
ftitutes of Ghazan Khan. New Asiatic Mifcell. N II.
p. 13c. Though the sentiments of the Committee of
Revenue, composed of persons eminent for their abi-
lities, lean to a conclusion against the hereditary right
of the Zemindars in the foil, yet the Supreme Council,
in the year 1786, declined, for good reasons, to give
any decisive judgment on a fubjecd of such magnitude.
This note was sent to the press before I had it in
my power to peruse Mr. Rouse's ingenious and in-
ftruaive DifTertation concerning the landed property of
Bengal. In it he adopts an opinion contrary to that
of Mr. Grant, and maintains, with that candour and
liberality of sentiment which are always conspicuous
where there is no other object in view but the discovery
of truth, that the Zemindars of Bengal possess their
landed property by hereditary right. Were I pofiefled
of such knowledge, either of the fate of India, or of
the system of administration eftablifled there, as would
be requisite for comparing these different theories, and
determining which of them merits the preference, the
tubjrd es my refarchcs does not render it neceflary to

enter

enter into such a disquisition. I imagine, however,
that the tate of landed property in India might be
greatly illustrated by an accurate comparison of it with
the nature of feudal tenures; and I apprehend that
there might be traced there a fuccefion of changes
taking place, in much the fame order as has been oh-
served in Europe, from which it might appear, that
the poffeflion of land was granted at first during plea-
sure, afterwards for life, and at length became perpe-
tual and hereditary property. But even under this lass
form, when land is acquired either by purchase or in-
heritance, the manner in which the right of property
is confirmed and rendered complete, in Europe by a
Charter, in India by a Sunnud fiom the sovereign, seems
to point out what was its original state. According to
each of the theories which I have mentioned, the te-
nure and condition of the Ryots nearly resemble the
description which I have given of them. Their state, we
learn from the accounts of intelligent observers, is as
happy and independent as falls to the lot of any race of
men employed in the cultivation of the earth. The
ancient Greek and Roman writers, whose acquaintance
with the interior parts of India was very imperfet, re-
present the fourth part of the annual produce of land as
the general average of rent paid to the sovereign. Upon
the authority of a popular author who flourished in
India prior to the Christian xera, we may conclude that
a sixth part of the people's income was, in his time,
the usual portion of the sovereign. Sacontala, ACt V.
p. 53. It is now known that what the sovereign re-
ceives from land varies greatly in different parts of the
country, and is regulated by the fertility or barrenness

E E 3 of

of the foil, the uature of the climate, the abundance
or scarcity of water, and many other obvious circum-
Clances. By the account given of it, I (hould imagine
that, in some diftries, it has been iraifed beyond its
due proportion. One circamftance with refpeAt to the
administration of revenue ill Bengal merits notice, as it
redounds to the honour of the Emperor Akber, the
wisdom of whose government I have often had occasion
to celebrate. A general and regular afleffinent of re-
venue in Bengal was formed in his reign. All the
lands were then valued, and the rent of each inhabit-
ant and of each village ascertained. A regular grada-
tion of accounts was eftablifled. The rents of the
different inhabitants who lived in one neighbourhood
being collected together, forr ed the account of a village;
the rents of several villages being next collected into one
view, formed the accounts of a larger portion of land.
The aggregate of these accounts exhibited the rent of
a diftricO, and the fum total of the rents of all the
diicrics in Bengal, formed the account of the revenue
of the whole province. From the reign of Akber to
the government of Jaffeer Ali Cawn, A. D. 1757, the
annual amount of revenue, and the modes of levying
it, continued with little variation. But in order to
raise the funu which he had stipulated to pay the English
on his elevation, he departed from the w% ife arrange.
ments of Akbcr; mnvy new m.odes of af.fflncnt wcr,
introduced, and exactions multiplied.

continued row of shady trees, forming an avenue, to

utility in a hot climate) there is nothing similar in any
country. Rennel's Memoir, p. 69.

NOTE LXIII. p.250.

WE cannot place the equitable and mild government

of Akber in a point of view more advantageous, than
by contrasting it with the condu& of other Mahomedan
princes. In no country did this contrast ever appear
more striking than in India. In the thousandth year
of the Chriltian era, Mahmud ps Ghazna, to whose
dominion were fubjeded the fame countries which
formed the ancient kingdom of Ba&ria, invaded In-
doftan. Every ftep of his progress in it was marked with
blood and desolation. The most celebrated pagodas,
the ancient monuments of }Iindoo devotion and mag-
nificence, were deitroyed, the miniiters of religion were
maflacred, and with undiftinguifhing ferocity the coun-
try was laid waste, and the cities were plundered and
burnt. About fourhundred years after, Mahmrud,Timur
or Tamerlane, a conqueror of higher fame, turned his
irresistible arms against Indoftan and, though born il
an age more improved, he not only equalled, but often
so far furpafeld the cruel deeds of Mahmud, as to be
juilly branded with the odious name of the " Deftroyr
" ing Prince," which was given to him by the I-ln-
doos, the li utifirvilng vicWims of his rage. A rapid,

4
L . but

but striking description of their devastations may be
found in Mr. Orme's Dissertation on the Eftablilhments
made by the Mahomedan conquerors in Indoftan. A
more full account of them is given by Mr. Gibbon,
vol. v. p. 646. vol. vi. p. 339, &c. The arrogant
contempt with 'wjFh bigotted Mahomedans view all
the nations who haW not embraced the religion of the
prophet, will account for the unrelenting rigour of Mah-
mud and Timur towards the Hindoos, and greatly en-
hances the merit of the tolerant spirit and moderation
with which Akber governed his fubjeas. What im-
preflion the mild administration of Akber made upon
the Hindoos, we learn from a beautiful letter of Jeff-
want Sing, Rajah of Joudpore, to Aurengzebe, his
fanatical and peiacuting successor. " Your royal an-
C" ceftor, Akber, whose throne is now in heaven, con-
", duced the affairs of this empire in equity and firm
"' security for the space of fifty-two years, preserving
" every tribe of men in ease and happiness; whether
- they were followers of Jesus, or of Moses, of David,
" or of Mahomed; were they Brahmins, were they of
·' the feet of Dharians, which denies the eternity of
" matter, or of that which ascribes the exifence of the
" world to chance, they all equally enjoyed his counte-
"' nance and favour; insomuch that his people, in gra-
<" titude for the indiscriminate protecion which he as-
" forded them, distinguished him by the appellation of
" Yugg:t Grow, Guardian of MIankind. - If your
" Majesty places any faith in those books, by distinction
" called divine, you will there be inftruted, that God
"is the God of all mankind, not the God of Maho-

rnedans alone. The Pagan and the Mufflulman are

the labour of forty thousand men for forty years to

this mode of estimation may be, it conveys an idea of

INDIA, fays Strabo, produces a variety of substances

which dye the most admirable colours. That the In-
dicum, which produced the beautiful blue colour, is
the fame with the Indigo of the moderns, we may
conclude not only from the resemblance. of the name,
and the similarity of the effeds, but from the defcrip-
tion given by Pliny in the paftage which I have quoted
in the text, He knew that it was a preparation of a
vegetable substance, though he was ill-informed both
concerning the plant itself, and the proccfs by which
it was fitted for use, which will not appear surprising,
when we rccollet the account formerly given of the
strange ignorance of the ancients with rcfpect to the

from their bodies, the gradual accumulation of which

As Sanfkreet literature is altogether a new acqui-

fition to Europe, Baghvat-Geeta, the firit translation
from that language, having been publiflhed so late as
A. D. 1785, it is intimately connected with the fubjecA
of my inquiries, and may afford entertainment to some
of my readers, after having reviewed in the text, witlh
a greater degree of critical attention, the two Sanfkrect
works most worthy of notice, to give here a fuccin&
account of other compositions in that tongue with
which we have been made acqualinted. Thl ext'n;iv,

u'e of thc Sanikrect language is a circumstance whith
m-mrits particular attention. " 'The grand source of

Indian literature;' (s.tys Mr. Halhed, the first Eng-

lilhman who acquired the knowledge of Salnkreet,)
" the parent of almoli every dialec from the Perfuan
4c gulf to the China seas, is the Sanfkreet, a language

of the molt venerable and unfathomable antiquity;

4' which, although, at prcfent, (hut up in the libraries
C of Brahmins, and appropriated solely to the records
" of their religion, appears to have been current over
" moll of the Oriental world; and traces of its origi-
' nal extent may still be discovered in almolf every
¢ diltric of Alia. I have been often astonished to find
' the similitude of Santkreet words with those of Per-
' fian and Arabic, and even of Latin and Greek ; and
· those not in tschnical and metaphorical terms, which
* the mutuation of refined arts and improved man-
* ners might lhavc occasionally introduced, but in the
c ground-work of language, in monosyllables, in the
' names of numbers, and the appellations of fucli
"' t!ings as would be firlt discriminated on the imme-
': diate dawn of civilization. The resemblance whicl
I m.ay be obferned in the cllaracters on the medals and
" figcets of various diftrids of Asia, the light which
" :iey reciprocally reflet upon each other, and the

general analogy v.-lich they all bear to the fame
grand prototype, afibrd another ample field for ct-

, riofty. The coin.; cf Aftam, Napaul, Cafhmeerc,
" and many other kingdoms, are all stamped Witrl
" .Sanirect characetrs, a:nd mnoftly contain allusions to
* ;!ie oldS Sarilrect n.?tlnologv. The fame conformity

I have cofcrved cri the imnprrfiion of feals from
" IBotnan d-n! 'f'ilhbc. . cullattcral inference may

i" likewise

"likewise be deduced from the peculiar arrangement of
<" the Sanflcreet alphabet, so very different from that of
a any other quarter of the world. This extraordinary
" mode of combination still eifts in the greatest part
" of the East, from the Indus to Pegu, in dialects now

apparently unconneaed, and in characers com-

" pletely difuinilar; and it is a forcible argument that
' they are all derived from the fame source. Another
" channel of speculation presents itself in the names
" of persons and places, of titles and dignities, which
" are open to general notice, and in which, to the
" farthest limits of Asia, may be found manifest traces
c of the Sanfkreet." Preface to the Grammar of the
Bengal Language, p. 3. After this curious account of
the Sanfkreet tongue, I proceed to enumerate the works
which have been translated from it, besides the two
mentioned in the text.--. To Mr. Wilkins we are in-
debted for Heeto-pades or Amicable lJIrutc7ion, in a fe-
ries of connected fables, interspersed with moral, pru-
dential, and political maxims. This work is in such
high esteem throughout the East, that it has been tranf-
lated into every language spoken there. It did not
escape the notice of the Emperor Akber, attentive to
every thing that could contribute to promote useful
knowledge. He directed his Vizier, Abul Fazel, to
put it into a style suited to all capacities, and to illus-
trate the obscure passages in it, which he accordingly
did, and gave it the title of, The Criterion of WifdIom.
At length, these fables made their way into Europe,
and have been circulated there with additions and al-
terations, under the names of Pilpay and Efop. Many
of the Sanfkreet apologues are ingenious and beautiful,
and have been copied or imitated by the fabulists of

other

other nations. But in some of them the charaQem of the
animals introduced are very ill sustained; to describe a
tyger as extremely devout, and praaifing charity, and
other religious duties, p. 16. or an old mouse well
read in the Neetee Safrai, i. e. Systems of morality
and policy, p. 24.; a cat reading religious books, p. 35,
&c. discovers a want of taste, and an inattention to
propriety. Many of the moral sayings, if confidred
as detached maxims, are founded upon a thorough
knowledge of life and manners, and convey inftru&ion
with elegant simplicity. But the attempt of the author
to form his work into a conneced series of fables, and
his mode of interweaving with them such a number of
moral reflecions in prose and in verse, renders the
ftrucure of the whole so artificial that the perusal of
it becomes often unpleasant. Akber was so sensible of
this, that, among other inftrudions, he advises his
Vizier to abridge the long digressions in that work. By
these ftriaures it is far from my intention to detrat in
the smallest degree from the merit of Mr. Wilkins.
His country is much indebted to him for having opened
a new source of science and taste. The celebrity of
the Heeto-pades, as well as its intrinsic merit, not-
withstanding the defecs which I have mentioned,
justify his choice of it, as a work worthy of being
made known to Europe in its original form. From
reading this and his other translations, no man will
refuse him the praise, to which he modetly confines
his pretensions, " of having drawn a pi&ure which
" we suppose to be a true likeness, although we are
A( unacquainted with the original." Pref. p. xiv.-2.
In the first Number of the New Asiatic lifcellany, we
have a tranilation of a celebrated composition in the

East,

Eafn, known by the title of the Five Gems. It consists
of stanzas by five poets who attended the court of
Abiflura, King of Bengal. Some of these stanzas are
simple and elegant.--3. An ode translated from Wulli;
in which that extravagance of fancy, and those far-
fetched and unnatural conceits, which so often disgust
Europeans with the poetical compositions of the East,
abound too much. The editor has not informed us to
whose knowledge of the Sanlkrect we are indebted
for these two translations.-4. Some original grants of
land, of very ancient dates, translated by Mr. Wilkins.
It may seem odd, that a charter or legal conveyance of
property should be ranked among the literary com-
positions of any people. But so widely do the manners
of the I-Iindoos differ from those of Europe, that as our
lawyers multiply words and clauses, in order to render
a grant'complete, and to guard against every thing
that may invalidate it, the Pundits seem to dispatch the
legal part of the (Iced with brevity, but, in a long pre-
amble and conclusion,- make an extraordinary display
of their own learningr, eloquence, and powers of com-
position, both in prose and verse. The preamble to
one of these deeds is an encomium of the monarch
who grants the land, in a bold strain of Eastern ex-
aggeration: " When his innumerable army marched,
" the heavens were so filled with the dust of their feet
" that the birds of the air could reft upon it." " His

elephants moved like walking mountains, and the

" earth,oppretffd bytheir wcighlt, mouldered into dull."
It concludes with denouncing vengeance against those
who flould venture to infringe this grant: " Riches
" and the life of man are as transient as drops of water
" upon the leaf of the lotus. Learning this truth, O

sr N " lil !

" man! do not attempt, to deprive another of his pro-

perty." Asiatic Refcarches, vol. i. p. 123, &c. The

other grant, which appears to be still more ancient, is
not less remarkable. Both were found engraved on
plates of copper. Ib. p. 357, &c.-5. The tranfla-
tion of part of the Shaftcr, published by Colonel Dow,
in the year 7G68, ought perhaps to have been first
mentioned. But as this translation was not made by
him from the Sanfkreet, but taken from the mouth of
a Brahmin, who explained the Shafter in Persian, or
in the vulgar language of Bengal, it will fall more pro-
perly under notice when we come to inquire into the
fiate of fcicnce among the Hindoos, than in this place,
where we arc endeavouring to give some idea of their
taste and compoifion.

NOTE LXVII. p. 29r.

..s many of my readers may be unacquainted with

the xtr.ivagant length of the four eras or periods of
I-r.L.n chronology, it may be proper to give an account
of them from Mr. Halhcd's Preface to the Code of
Gcntoo Laws, p. xxxvi.

x. THE Suttee Jglie (or age of purity) is said to

have lasted three million tw.o hundred thousand years;
and they hold that the life of man was extended in that
age to one hundred thousand years, and that his stature
was twenty-one cubits.

2. TirE Tirota yogue (in which one third of mankind
was corrupted) they suppose to have confited of two

million

million four hundred thousand years, and that men
lived to the age of ten thousand years.

3. THE Dwwpaar ogzte (in which half of the human
race became depraved) endured one million fix hun-
dred thousand years; and the life of man was then re-
duced to a thousand years.

4. THE Collee Jogre (in which all mankind are cor-

rupted, or rather lessened, for that is the true meaning
of Collee) is the present sera, which they suppose or-
dained to subsist four hundred thousand years, of which
near five thousand are already part; and the life of
man in that period is limited to one hundred years.

IF we suppose the computation of time in the Indian

chronology to be made by solar or even by lunar years,
nothing can be more extravagant in itself, or more re-
pugnant to our mode of calculating the duration of tc.e
world, founded on sacrcd and infallible authority.
Some attempts have been made by learned men, parti-
cularly by M. Bailly, in a very ingenious dissertation
on that subjeR, to bring the chronology of the IHindoos
to accord somewhat better with that of the Old Testa-
ment; but, as I could not explain the principles upon
which he founds his conclusions, without entering into
long and intricate discussions foreign from the subjea of
this Dissertation, and as I cannot afllnt to some of his
opinions, I shall reft satisfied with referring to his
Astron. Indienne, Disc. Prelim. p. Ixxvii. and leave
my readers to judge for themfelvcs. I am happy to
observe that a Memoir on the Chronology of the IHin-
doos will be published in the Second Volume of the

F F 2 Tranf-

Tranfacions of the Society of Bengal, and I hope that
some learned member of that body will be able, from
his acquaintance with the languages and history of the
country, to throw light upon a fubjcl which its
connection with religion and science renders extremely
interesting. From one circumstance, however, which
merits attention, we may conclude, that the informa-
tion which we have hitherto received concerning the
chronology of the Hindoos is very incorrect. We have,
as far as I know, only five original accounts of the
different Jogues or eras of the Hindoos. The first is
given by M. Roger, who received it from the Brahmins
on the Coromandel coast. According to it, the Suttee
Jogue is a period of one million seven hundred and
twenty-eight thousand years; the Tirtah Jogue is one
million two hundred and ninety-fix thousand years;
the Dwapaar Jogue is eight hundred and fixty-four
thousand years. The duration of the Ccllee Jogue he
does not specify. Porte Ouverte, p. 179. The next
is that of M. Bernicr, who received it from the Brah-
mins of Benares. According to him, the duration of
the Suttee Jogue was two million five hundred thou-
sand years; that of the Tirtah Jogue one million two
hundred thousand years; that of the Dwapaar Jogue i.
eight hundred and iixty-four thousand years. Con-
cerning the period of the Collee Jogue, he, likewise,
is silent. Voyages, tom. ii. p. I6o. The third is that
of Colonel Dow, according to which the Suttee Joguc
is a period of fourteen million of years; the Tirtah
Jogue one million eighty thousand; the Dwapaar
Jogue feventy-two thoufi.nd; and the Collee Jogue
thirty-fix thousand years. Hilt. of Hindolt. vol. i.
p. 2. The fourth account is that of M. Le Gentil,

who

who received it from the Brahmins of the Coromandel
coast, and as his information was acquired in the fame
part of India, and derived from the fame source with
that of M. Roger, it agrees with his in every particular.
Mhem. de l'Academ. des Sciences pour 1772, tom. ii.
part i. p. 176. The fifth is the account of Mr. Halhed,
which I have already given. From this discrepancy,
not only of the total numbers, but of many of the
articles in the dificrent accounts, it is manifest that
our information concerning Indian chronology is
hitherto as uncertain as the whole system of it is wild
and fabulous. To me it appears highly probable, that
when we understand more thoroughly the principles
upon which the facitious eras or Jogues of the Hin-
doos have been formed, that we may be more able to
reconcile their chronology to the true mode of com-
puting time, founded on the authority of the Old Testa-
ment; and may likewise find reason to conclude, that
the account given by their astronomers of the situation
of the heavenly bodies at the beginning of the Collee
Jogue, is not eftablified by actual observation, but the
result of a retrofpetive calculation. Whoever under-
takes to invefligate farther the chronology of the Hin-
doos, will derive great assistance from a Memoir of Mr.
Marfden on that fubjeEt, in which he has explained the
nature of their year, and the several eras in irfe among
them, with much ingenuity and precision. Philof.
Tranfad. vol. Ixxx. part ii. p. 560.

3 ~ NOTE

NOTE LXVIII. I. 3jo.

IN the public buildings of India, we find proofs and

monu:.mnts of the proficiency of the Irahmins in
icierce, par:icular!y of tl:cir attention to astronomical
obfcrvation. Their religion enjoins, that the four fides
of a Pagoda should face tile four cardinal points. In
order to execute this v.ith accuracy, they take a me-
thod dcfcribed by Ml. Ie Gcntil, which discovers a
considerable degree of science. He carefully examined
the position of one of their Pagodas, and found it to be
periecly txac. Voy. torn. i. p. 133, &c. As some
of their Pagodas are very ancient, they mult have early
attained such a portion of knowledge as was requisite
for placing them properly. On the ceilings of Choul-
trys, and other ancient edifices, the twelve signs of
the zodiac are often delineated ; and, from their re-
semblance to those which are now universally used, it
is highly probable that the knowledge of these arbitrary
symbols was derived from the East. Colonel Call has
publilhed a drawing of the signs of the zodiac, which he
found on the ceiling of a Choultry at Verdapettah, in
the MIadura country. Phii. Transact. vol. lxii. p. 353.
I have a drawing of them in my possession, differing
from his in some of the figures, but I cannot fay in
what particular place it was found. Sir Robert Barker
describes an oblcr atory at Benares, which he visited
A. 1). 1772. In it lh found inflruments for aftro-
nomical obfcr-atiin, of very large dimnifions, and
constructcd with great ikill and ingenuity. Of all
thJc iie h s publifTicd rawings Pil. Tranfacd.

vol.

vol. Ixvil. p. 598. According to traditionary account,
this observatory was built by the Emperor Akber. The
view which Sir Robert took of it was an hasty one. It
merits a more attentive infpecion, in order to deter-
mine whether it was conftruaed by Akber, or ereited in
some more early period. Sir Robert intimates, that none
but Brahmins who underflood the Sanlkreet, and could
consult the astronomical tables written in that language,
were capable of calculating eclipfcs. P. Tieffenthaler
describes, in a very cursory manner, two observatories
furnished with instruments of extraordinary magnitude,
at Jepour and Ougein, in the country of Ialwa. Ber-
nouilli, torn i. p. 316. 347. But these are modern
itrutures.

SINCE the sirs edition of the Hliftorical Disquisition

was published, the Souriak Seddantam, or, according
to a more correEt orthography, the Surya Siddhlnita,
on the principles of which I had observed that all the
ndlian Astronomy is founded, has been difcovcrcd at
Benares by Sir Robert Chambers. lIe immediately
communicated this valuable work to Samuel Davis,
Efq. who has favoured the world with a translation
of several confidcrable extracts from it.

THE Surya Siddhanta is composed in the Sanlkreet

language, and profefles to be a divine revelation, (a:
Abul Fazel had related, Ayeen Akbery, 11I. p. 8.) corm-
municated to mankind, more than two millions of
years ago, towards the close of the Sutty or Satya
Jogue, the firlt of the four fa:uluus ages ;;:;o ivhich
lhe Hinidoo Mythologilis divide the perild dluriilg

r : 4 v. !hi.h

v .:ch they suppose the world to have exifecd. But
x.;Len this accoi.;p aiment of fiction and cxtravagance
is removced, there is left bchind a very rational and
clSbc;ae f, tem cf aeroiiomic.: calculation. From
this M1r. Davis has fciected what relates to the calcula-
tion of Eciipfcs, and has illustrated it with grcat il-
gcnuitv. IThe ninn-:r in which that subjcd is treated
has si close an affiiity to :Ite methods formerly brought
from India, and of which I have given fiome account,
ns to confirm itrongly t':- opinion that the Sfirya
Siddhli.nta is the source from which all the others are
derived. Ihow far the real date of this work may
be afccrtaiued from the rules and tables which it con-
tains, will b. more clearly citabliflhd when a translation
of the whole is published. In the mean time it is
evident, that what is already known with refpec to
thcfe rules and tables, is extremely favourable to the
hypothesis which ascribes a very high antiquity to lie
Aitronomy of the Brahmins.

THE circumstance, perhaps, most worthy of atten-

tion in the Extracs now referred to, is the fvitcm of
Trigonometry included in the Astronomical rules of
the Sirva Siddhlntl. Afiat. Refeirch. ii. p. 245.
249. It may be shewn that this fyenie is founded
on certain Geometric.ll Theorems, which, though
modern Mathematicians be well acquainted with, were
certainly unknown to Ptolemy and the Greek Geo-
metricians.

IT is with plcafire, too, we obfervc, that Mr. Davis
has in his poffeflion fevcral other ancient books of

Hlin!oo

-lindoo Astronomy, and that there is reason to expeE
from him a translation of the whole Surya Siddhanta.

IT must be added, that we also learn from the second

volume of the Afiatick Researches, that some vestiges
of Algebraical calculation have been discovered among
the Brahmins; particularly Rules for the solution of
of certain Arithmetical questions, with which it ihould
seem that nothing but Algebra could have furnished
them. Afiat. Research. ii. p. 468 note, 487. 495.

MY friend, Mr. Professor Playfair, has examined

that Extract from the Surya Siddhinta, which gives an
account of the ancient Hindoo system of Trigonometry,
and has discovered the principles on which it is found-
ed. It is with pleasure I announce, that the tefult of
this examination will be communicated soon to the
Publick; and will afford an additional proof of the ex-
traordinary progress which the natives of India had
early made in the molt abstruse sciences.
