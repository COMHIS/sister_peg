# PREFACE.

PREFACE.
T H E perusal of Major Rennell's

Memoir for illustrating his Mrap of

Indoftan, one of the most valuable geo-
graphical treatises that has appeared in
any age or country, gave rife to the fol-
lowing work. It suggested to me the
idea of examining more fully than I had
done in the Introductory Book to my
History of America, into the knowledge
which the Ancients had of India, and of
confidering what is certain, what is ob-
fcure, and what is fabulous, in the ac-
counts of that country which they have

a handed
___U

hn'l-i do'.nV: to u. in undcrtaking this

inquir;, I h1.d origiul ly no other object

than my o.vwn amusement and inftrudion:

But in crrying it on, and consulting with
care the authors of antiquity, some facts,
hitherto unobserved, and many which had

not been examined with proper attention,
occurred; nw views opened; my ideas
gradually extended and became more in-

teresting; until, at length, I imagined
that the result of my researches might

prove amusing and inftrufive to others,

by exhibiting such a view of the various

.;odes in which intercourse with India had

been carried on from the earliest times, as
ir.iht ihew how much that great branch
cf commerce has contributed, in every age,
to increase the wealth and power of the
nations which pofleffed it.

THUS the Hiflorical Disquisition which
I now lay before the Reader was begun
ard completed. W hat degree of merit

it

it poffefTfs, the Pubic mnut determin e.
My grateful recolledion of tihe fvourable

manner in which my other works have

been received, naturally i!creafs the f-

licitude with which I wait for its d-

cifion concerning this which i now pub-
lifh.

WHEN I first turned my thoughts to

this subjed, I was so fully aware of the
disadvantage under which I laboured in
undertaking to describe countries of which
I had not any local knowledge, that I
have been at the utmost pains to guard
against any errors which this might oc-
cafion. I have consulted, with perse-
vering industry, the works of all the au-
thors I could procure, who have given any
account of India; I have never formed

any decided opinion, which was not sup-
ported by very refpetable authority; and
as I have the good fortune to reckon
among the number of my friends some

Gentlemen

Gentlemen who have filled important 1ta-

tions, civil and milirry, in India, and

who h1ve viiit mnv different parts of
it, I h1 reco.re frequently t: them, and
fro-n tir convzcrl.rian lelrnd things

v.hich I coil nort h.:c foalnl in books.

VzI-rc it prc;?r :3 mnrlion their names,
the Public xvoulJ allow th-t by their dif-
cc:nment and abilities they are fully en-
ti:ld to the confidence which I have placed
in them.

IN the progress of the work, I became

finsible of my own deficiency with re-
se2t to another point. In order to give
an acurate idea of the imperfection both
oc the theory and pratice of navigation
am.crrg the Ancients, and to explain with
fcicntific recision, the manner in which
they ascertained the position of places,
and calculated their longitude and latitude,
a greter portion of mathematical know-
ledge was requisite, than my attention to

other

other studies had permitted me to acquire.
What I wanted, the friendship of my in-

genious and refpedtable Colleague, Mr.
Playfair, Professor of Mathematics, has
supplied, and I have been enabled by him
to elucidate all the points I have men-

tioned, in a manner which, I am confi-

dent, will afford my Readers complete
fatisfadion. To him, likewise, I am in-

debted for the confirudion of two maps
necessary for illustrating this Disquisition,

which without his assistance I could not
have undertaken.

I H AVE adhered, in this work, to an

arrangement I followed in my former com-
positions, and to which the Public has
been long accustomed. I have kept his-
torical narrative as much separate as possible
from scientific and critical discussions, by
reserving the latter for Notes and Illuftra-
tions. I flatter myself that I may claim,

without

without presumption, the merit of having
examined with diligence what I submit
to public infpedtion, and of having re-
ferred, with scrupulous accuracy, to the
authors from which I ave derived in-

/
formation.

X1ITHOEVER attempts to. trace the opera- E CT.

markthe various steps of their progrefs.in, ay -v
line of exertion,.will :soon have the iportfica-

S E T. venture myself, nor endeavour to conduct my

I readers. In my researches concerning the in-

tercourfe between the Eastern and Western re-
gions of the earth, and concerning the progress
of that great branch of trade, which, in every
age, has contributed so conspicuously towards
raising the people who carried it on, to wealth
and power, I (hall confine yfelf within the
precincts I have marked out. Wherever the
inspired writers, intent upon higher ob-
jees, mention occasionally any circumisance
that tends to illustrate the fubjeEt of my in-
quiries, i hall attend to it with reverence.
Whatever o:her writers relate, I shall examine
with freedom, and endeavour to ascertain the
degree of credit to which they are entitled.

THE original tation allotted to man by his

Creator, was in the mild and fertile regions of
the East. There the human race began its ca-
reer of improvement; and from the remains of
sciences which were anciently cultivated, as
well as of arts which were anciently exercised
in India, we may conclude it to be one of the
first countries in which men made any confi-
derable progress in that career. The wifdoln
of the East was early celebrated ', and its pro-
ductions were early in request among diltant
nations b. 'The intercourse, however, between
different countries was carried on firlt entirely
by land. -As the people of the l'ast appear soon
to have acquired complete dominion over the
useful animals ', they could early undertake
the long and toilsome journies which it was ne-
ceffary to make, in order to maintain this in-
tercourfe; and by the provident bounty of

Heaven, they were urnifhed w aith a bast ofS E C T.
burden, without whose aid it would have been I-
impossible to accomplish them. The Camel,
by its persevering strength, by its moderation
in the use of food, and the singularity of its
internal ftrudure, which enalhles it to lay in a
fock of water sufficient for several days, put it
in their power to convey bulky commodities
through those deserts, which must be traversed
by all who travel from any of the countries
weft of the Euphrates towards India. Trade
was carried on in this manner, particularly by
the nations near to the Arabian Gulf, from the
earliest period to which hiltorical information
reaches. Diltant journies, however, would be
undertaken at first only occasionally, and by a
few adventurers. But by degrees, from attention
to their mutual safety and comfort, numerous
bocies of merchants assembled at Rated times,
and forming a temporary association (known
afterwards by the name of a Caravan), go-
verned by officers of their own choice, and sub-
jed to regulations of which experience had
taught them the utility, they performed jour-
nies of such extent and duration, as appear
altonifling to nations not accustomed to this
mode of carrying on commerce.

BUT notwithllanding every improvement that

could be made in the manner of conveying the
productions of one country to another by land,
the inconveniences ,which attended it were
obvious and unavoidable. It was often dan-
gerous; always expensive, and tedious and fa-
tiguing. A method of communication more
easy and expeditious was fought, ad the inge-
nuity of man gradually discovered, that the
rivers, the arns of the lea, and even the ocean
itself, were destined to 'bpen and facilitate in-

B tercourfe

E C T. tercourfe with the various regions of the earth,

I. between which they appear, at first view, to
'-^ be placed as insuperable barriers. Navigation,

however, and ship-building, (as I have observed
in another work ) are arts so nice and com-
plicated, that they require the talents, as well
as experience of many successive ages, to bring
them to any degree of perfection. From the
raft or canoe, which served to carry a savage
over the river that obftru&ed him in the chace,
to the conftru&ion of a vessel capable of con-
veying a numerous crew, or a considerable
cargo of good, to a distant coast, the progress
of improvement is immense. Many efforts
would be made, many experiments would be
tried, and much labour as well as ingenuity
would be employed, before this arduous and
important undertaking could be accomplifbe..

EVEN after some improvement was made in

ship-building the intercourse of nations with
each other by sea was far from being extensive.
From the accounts of the earliest historians, we
learn that navigation made its firit efforts in the
Mediterranean and the Arabian Gulf, and in
them the first ative operations of commerce
were carried on. From an attentive infpetion
of the position and form of these two great in-
land eas, thee accounts appear to be highly
probable. These seas lay open the continents
of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and spreading to
a great extent along the coasts of the most ser-
tile and most early civilized countries in each,
seem to have been destined by nature to faci-
litate their communication with one another.
We find, accordingly, that the first voyages of
the Egyptians and Phenicians, the molt ancient

navigators mentioned in history, were made inS E C T.
the Mediterranean. Their trade, however, was I
not long confined to the countries bordering "
upon it. By acquiring early poffefion of ports
on the Arabian Gulf, they extended the sphere
of their commerce, and are represented as the
firt people of the Weft who opened a commu.
nication by sea with India.

IN that account of the progress of navigation

and discovery which I prefixed to the His-
tory of America, I confidered with attention
the maritime operations of the Egyptians and
Phenicians; a brief review of them here, as far
as they relate to their connetion with India,
is all that is requisite for illustrating the fubjeet
of my present inquiries. With refpe& to the
former of these people, the information which
history affords is slender, and of doubtful au-
thority. The fertile foil and mild climate of
Egypt produced the necessaries and comforts of
life in such profusion, as to render its inhabi-
tants so independent of other countries, that it
became early an eftablilhed maxim in their po.
licy, to renounce all intercourse with foreigners.
In consequence of this, they held all sea-faring
persons in detestation, as impious and profane;
and fortifying their harbours, they denied
strangers admiflion into them '

THE enterprising ambition of Sefofris, dif

daining the restraints imposed upon it by these
contraced ideas of his subje&s, prompted him
to render the Egyptians a commercial people
and in the course of his reign, he so completely
accomplished this, (that if we may give credit

enterprising spirit of commerce prompted them S E C T.
to wrest from the Idumseans lome commodious I.
harbours towards the bottom of the Arabian Gulf. ~V
From thele they held a regular intercourse with
India, on the one hand, and with the Faftern
and Southern coasts of Africa on the other.
The distance, however, from the Arabian Gulf
to Tyre was considerable, and rendered the
conveyance of goods to it by land carriage so
tedious and expensive, that it became necessary
for them to take poffeflion of Rhinocolura, the
nearelt port in the Mediterranean to the Arabian
Gulf. Thither all the commodities brought
from India, were conveyed over land by a route
much ihorter, and nmore practicable than that
by which the producions of the aft were car-
ried ata subsequent period from the oppofitehore
of the Arabian Gulf to the Nile . At hino-
colura, they were refhippcd, and transported
by an eafv navigation to Tyre, and diftlibuted
through the world. 'Ihis, as it is the earliest
route of communication with India, of which
we have any authentic description, had so many
advantages over any ever known before the
modern discovery of a new course of navigation
to the East, that the Phenicians could supply
other nations with the productions of India in
greater abundance, and at a cheaper rate, than
any people of antiquity. To this circumitance,
which, for a considerable time, secured to them a
monopoly of that trade, was owing, not only
the extraordinary wealth of individuals, which
rendered the " merchants of Tyre, Princes,
"and her traffickers the Honourable of the
"Earth'; but the extensive power of the slate
itself, which first taught mankind to conceive

s E C T what van. resources a commercial people poffers;

and what great exertions they are capable of
making.

THE Jews, by their vicinity to Tyre, h-ad

such an opportunity of observing the wealth
which flowed into that city from the lucrative
commerce carried on by the Phenicians from
their ettlements on the Arabian Gulf, as in-
cited them to aim at obtaining ome share of
it. This they effeced under the prosperous
reigns of David and Solomon, partly by the
conquests which they made of a Imall diftrit
in the land of Edom, that gave them peffion
of the harbours of Olath and l:fion:;cher on the
Red Sea, and partly by the friendship of Hi-
ram, king of Tyre; who enabled Solomon to
fit out fleets, which, under the diretion of
Phenician pilots, failed to Tarshish and Ophir'.
In what region of the earth, we should search
for there famous ports which furnished the navy
of Solomon with the various commodities enu-
merated by the-facred historians, is an inquiry
that has long exercised the industry of learned
men. They were early supposed to be situated in
some part of India, and the Jews were held to
be one of the latfons which traded with
thit country. But the opinion more generally
adopted is, that Soldmoh's fleets, after passing
the 'tiits of abbelmandeb, held their course
atong tie btith-weft coast of Africa, as far as
tfe kingd6ii of Sofala; a country celebrated
for is ith nmiles of gold and silver, (from which
it has been denominated the Golden Sofala
By Oriefltal rtiter ",) and abounding in all the
6thlr attie whlcl totmpofed the eargoe of

curate

curate researches of M. D'Anville rendered E C T.
highly probable ', seems now to be etabliihed I
with the utmost certainty by a late learned tra-
veller; who, by his knowledge of the mon-
soons in the Arabian Gulf, and his attention to
the ancient mode of navigation, both in that
sea and along the African coast, has not only
accounted for the extraordinary length of time
which the fleets of Solomon took in going and
returning, but has hewn, from circumstances
mentioned concerning the voyage, that it was
not made to any place in India °. The Jews,
then, we may conclude, have no title to be
reckoned among the nations which carried on
intercourse with India by sea; and if, from de-
ference to the sentiments of some refpeEtable
authors, their claim were to be admitted, we
know with certainty, that the commercial es-
fort which they made in the reign of Solomon
was merely a transient one, and that they quickly
returned to their former ate of unsocial feclu-
sion from the reft of mankind.

FROM colleting the scanty information which

history affords, concerning the molf early at-
tempts to open a commercial intercourse with
India, I now proceed, with more certainty and
greater confidence, to trace the progress of.
communication with that country, under the.
guidance of authors who recorded events nearer
to their own times, and with refpet to which,
they had received more full and accurate in-:
telligence.

and cnterprizin talents, as rend.red him wor-

£iould fem with much difficulty, and not\ith-
itanding many obitacles; for he spent no less
than two years and fix months in conducing
his squadron from the place where he em arkecd,
to the Arabian Gulf'. The account which he
gave of the populousness, fertility, and high
cultivation of that region of India through
vhich his course lay, rendered Darius impa-
tient to become master of a country so valua-

xhich he levied from it, was near a third part
of the whole revenue of the Persian monar-
chy . But neither this voyage of Scylax, nor
the conquefs of Darius, to which it gave rife,
dii'ufed any general knowledge of India. The
Greeks, who were the only enlightened people
at that time in Europe, paid but little attention
to the tranfCtions of the nations whom they con-
lilered as liarbarians, especially in countries far
remote from their own; and Scylax had em-
bellihicd the narrative of his vovage with so
nri:tmi circumfi.alces, manifestly fabulous , that

conqueror, a politician, or a legislator, has
seldom been justly estimated. The fubje of

rations only in one light, but it will enable me
to exhibit a striking view of the grandeur and
extent of his plans. He seems, soon after his

',_ .of eftabiishing an universal monarchy, and as-

pired to the dominion of the sea, as well as of
the land. From the wonderful efforts of the
Tvrians in their own defence, when left with-
out any ally or protecor, he conceived an high
opinion o the resources of maritime power,
and of the wealth to be derived from commerce,
efpeciallv that with India, which he found en-
grossed tv the citizens of Tyre. With a view
to secure this coinmerce, and to etablifll a fta-
tion tor it, preferable in many refpecs to that
of T re. as ioon as he coinplrted the conquest
cf Eryvpt, he t:'u:i.cd a cihv near one of the
routurs o; the Nile, whiich he honoured with
his on name; and with such admirable dif.
cernmen: was the situation of it chosen, that
Alexandria loon became the greatest trading
city in rhe ancient world ; and, notwithstanding
many fucceltlv revolutions in empire, continu-
ed, during c;ilteen centuries, to be the chief
feat of commerce with India . Amidst the mi-
litary operations to which Alexander was soon
obliged to turn his attention, the desire of ac-
quiring the lucrative commerce which the Ty-
rians had carried on withIndia, was not relin-
quifhed. Events soon occurred, that not only
confirmed and added strength to his desire, but
opened to him a profped of obtaining the so-
vereignty of those regions which supplied the
reft of mankind with so many precious comma-
dities.

AFTER his final victory over the Persians,

he was led in pursuit of the last Darius, and of
Beffus, the murderer of that unfortunate mo-
narch, to traverse that part of Asia which

firetches from the Caspian ea beyond the river S E C T,
Oxus. He advanced towards the ealt as far as 1
Maracanda , then a city of some note, and def-
tined, in a future period, under the modern
name of Samarcand, to be the capital of an
empire not inferior to his own in extent or
power. In a progress of several months, through
provinces hitherto unknown to the Greeks, in
a line of march often approaching near to India,
and among people much accustomed to much
intercourse with it, he learned many things con-
cerning the state of a country" that had been
long the objec of his thoughts and wishes ',
which increased his desire of invading it. De-
cifive and prompt in all his resolutions, he set
out from Batria, and crossed that ridge of
mountains which, under various denominations,
forms the Stony Girdle (if I may use an ex-
preflion of the Oriental geographers) which en-
circles Alia, and constitutes the northern barrier
of India.

THE molt praticable avenue to every coun-

try, it is obvious, mulf be formed by circum-
fiancej in its natural situation, such as the de-
files which lead through mountains, the course
of rivers, and the places where they may be
pasted with the greatest ease and safety. In no
place of the earth is this line of approach
marked and defined more conspicuously, than
on the northern frontier of India; insomuch
that the three great invaders of this country,
Alexander, raamerlane, and Nadir Shah, in
three distant ages, and with views and talents
extremely different, advanced by the fame route,
with hardly any deviation. Alexander had the

I pa1i-in the moun'.ains, he encamped at Alexan-

dria aropamifana. on the fame ite with the
modern cit. Candahar ; and having Iubdued or
conciiiated the nations feated on the north-west
bank of the Indus, he crossed the river atTaxila,
now Attock, the onlv place where its stream is
so tranquil that a bridge can be thrown over
it '.

AFTER pasSing the Indus, Alexander marched

forward in the road which leads direcly to the
Ganges, and the opulent provinces to the south-
eai, now comprehended under the general name
of Indoitan. But, on the banks of the 1lydaf-
pes, known in modern times by the name of
the Eetah or Chelumr, he was opposed by Porus,
a powerful monarch of the country, at the head
cf a numerous army. The war with Porus,
a;nd the hostilities in which he was fucceflively
ci. aged x ith other Indian Princes, led him to
de\ iate from his original route, and to turn more
5tcardg the south-west. In carrying on these
operations, Alexander marched through one of
the richeit and belt peopled countries of India,
now called the Panjab, from the five great riv-
ers by which it is watered; and as we know
that this march was performed in the rainy sea-
son, when even Indian armies cannot keep the
field, it gives an high idea both of Alexander's
persevering spirit, and of the extraordinary vi-
gour and hardines of conflitution which fol-
diers, in ancient times, derived from the united
effeds of gvmnaftic exercise and military dif-
cipline. In every ftep of his progress, objecs no
less itriking than new prelented themselves to
Alexander. The magnitude of the Indus, even
after he had seen the Nile, the Euphrates, and

the 'l'iris, mult have filled him with surprise . S E C T.
No country he had hitherto visited was o po-
pulous and ell cultivated, or abounded in f,
many valuable productions of nature and of art,
as that part of India through which he had led
his army. But when he was informed in every
place, and probably with exaggerated defcrip-
tion, how much the Indus was inferior to the
Ganges, and how far all that he had hitherto
beheld was surpassed in the happy regions
through which that great river flows, it is no,
wonderful that his eagerness to view and to take
poiefltion of them should have prompted him to
assemble his soldiers, and to propose that they
should re.ume their march towards that quarter
where wealth, dominion, and fame awaited
them. Bet they had already done so much, and
had fuffcred so greatly, especially from excelfive
rains a:id cxtenlive inundations, that their pa-
tience as well as trength were exhausted , and
v\ith one voice they refused to advance farther.
In this rblution they persisted with such fullen
obti!ltncy, that Alexander, though poffefled in
ihc llhI-)ll de-ree of every quality that gains an
al-ucmilnt over the minds of military men, was
,bi';? .l to yi-ld, and to issue orders for march-
ing bi.'.ik to P^'ria .

and now by that of the Setlege, to which Alex-

I bank of the Hyphafis, where he erected twelve

flupendous altars, which he intended as a mo-
nu:nent of his explnts, and which (if we may
believe the biographer of Apollonius 1'yanreus)
were ilill remaining, with legible inscriptions,
when that fantastic fophit visited India, three
hundred and feventv-three years after Alexan-
der's expedition . The breadth of the Panjab,
from Ludhana on the Setlege to Attock on the
Indus, is computed to be two hundred and
fifty-nine geographical miles, in a straight line;
and Alexander's march, computed in the fame
manner, did not extend above two hundred
miles. But, both as he advanced and returned,
his troops were so spread over the country, and
often aed in so many separate divisions, and all
his movements were so exactly measured and de-
lineated by men of science, whom he kept in
pay for the purpose, that heacquired a very ex-
tensive and accurate knowledge of that part of
India .

WHEN, upon..his return, he reached the

banks of theHydapes,.he found that the offi-
cers to whom he had given it in charge to build
and co'led as many veffels.as pofrible, had exe-
cuted his orders with such activity and success
that they had affembed a numerous fleet. As
amidst the hurry of war, and the rage of con-
quest, he.never loft fight of his pacific and
commercial schemes, the destination of this
fleet was to fail down the Indus to the ocean,
and from its. mouth to proceed to the Persian
Gulf, that a communication by sea might be
opened with India and the centre of his do-
minions.

THE condu& of this expedition was commit- S E C T.

ted to Nearchus, an officer equal to that im- 1.
portant trust. But as Alexander was ambitious
to acquire fame of every kind, and fond of en-
gaging in new and splendid undertakings, he
himself accompanied Nearchus in his naviga-
tion down the river. The armament was, in-
deed, so great and magnificent, as deserved to
be commanded by the conqueror of Asia. It
was composed of an army of twenty thousand
men, and two hundred elephants, and a fleet
of near two thousand vessels, various in burden
and form'; on board of which one-third of the
troops embarked, while the remainder marching
in two divisions, one on the right, and the other
on the left, of the river, accompanied them in
their progrcfs. As they advanced, the nations
on each fide were either compelled or persuaded
to submit. Retarded by the various operations
in which this engaged him, as well as by the
flow navigation of such a fleet as he conduced,
Alexander was above nine months before he
reached the ocean g.

ALEXANDLR'S progress in India, in this line

of direction, was far more considerable than
that which he made by the route we for-
merly traced; and when we attend to the va-
rious movements of his troops, the number of
cities which they took, and the different ates
a'hich they subdued, he may be said not only to
have viewed, but to have explored, the coun-
tries through which he passed. This part of In-
dia has been so little frequented by l'uropeans in
later times, that neither the position of places,
nor their distances, can be ascertained with the

1 e\en in the Panjab. But from the researches
' -- of Major Renneli, carried on with no lels dif-

cernment than industry, the distance of that
place on the Hydafpes, where Alexander fitted
out his fleet from the ocean, cannot be le's
than a thousand Britiih miles. Of this extensive
region a considerable portion, particularly the
upper Delta, stretching from the capital of the
ancient Malli, now Moultan, to Patala, the
modern Tatta, is distinguished for its fertility
anli population.

SoON after he reached the ocean, Alexander.
aitisid with having accomplified this arduous
undertakin:, led his army by land back toPerfia.
Tne coimmand of the feet. with a considerable
body of troops on board of it, he left to Near-
cl:us, who, after a coasting voyage of seven
menths, conducted it safely up the Persian Gulf

Is this manner did Alexander first open the

knowledge of India to the people of Europe,
and an extensive district of it was surveyed with
greater accuracy than could have been expected
from the short time he remained in that coun-
try. Fortunately an exac account, not only of
his military operations, but of every thing
worthy of notice in the countries where they
were carried on, \asd recorded in the Memoirs
-or Journals of three of his principal officers,
Ptolemy the son of Lagus, Ariltobulus, and
Nearchus. The two former have not indeed
reached our times, but it is probable that the
mofl important facts which they contained, are

them as his guides in his History of the Expe- I.
dition of Alexanderk; a work which, though '
composed long after Greece had loft its liberty,
and in an age when genius and taste were on
the decline, is not unworthy the purest times
of Attic literature.

WITH refped to the general state of India,

we learn from these writers, that in the age of
Alexander, though there was not eftabliflied in
it any powerful empire, resembling that which
in modern times itretched its dominion from
the Indus alinoft to Cape Comorin, it was even
then formed into monarchies of considerable
extent. The king of the Prafij was prepared
on the banks of the Ganges to oppose the Ma-
cedonians, with an armv of twenty thousand
cavalry, two thousand armed chariots, and a
great number of elephants'. The territory of
which Alexander conltitutedPorus the sovereign,
is said to have contained no fewer than two
thousand towns . Even in the most reftrided
sense that can be given to the vague indefinite
appellations of nations and towns, an idea is
conveyed of a very great degree of population.
As the fleet failed down the river, the country
on each fide was found to be in no refpe't in-
ferior to that of which the government was
committed to Porus.

Ir was likewise from the Memoirs of the

fame officers that Europe derived its first au-
thentic information concerning the climate, the
foil, the productions, and the inhabitants of
India; and in a country where the manners,

S E C T. the customs, and even the dress of the people

I are almoit as permanent and invariable as the
^'--- face of nature itself, it is wonderful how exaCt-

ly the descriptions given by Alexander's officers
delineate what we now behold in India, at the
distance of two thousand years. The flated
chance of seasons, now known by the name of
Mli,,;uts; the periodical rains; the swelling
of the rivers; the inundations which there oc-
cafion; the appearance of the country during
their continuance; are particularly mentioned
and described. No less accurate are the de-
scriptions which they have given of the inhabi-
tants, their delicate and slender form, their dark
complexion, their black uncurled hair, their
garments of cotton, their living entirely upon
vegetable food, their division into separate tribes
or cais, the members of which never intermar-
ry, the custom of wives burning themselves
with their deceased husbands, and many other
particulars, in all which they perfecly resemble
the modern Hindoos. To enter into any de-
tail with refpec to these in this place would be
premature; but as the subject, though curious
and interesting, will lead unavoidably into dif-
culions not well suited to the nature of an
hiforical work, I flall reserve my ideas con-
cerning it for an Appendix, which I purpose to
annex to this Disquisition; and hope they may
contribute to throw some additional light upon
the origin and nature of the commerce with
India.

MUCH as the Weflern world was indebted

for its knowledge of India to the expedition of
Alexanaer, it was only a small portion of that
vast continent which he explored. His opera-
tions did not extend beyond the modern pro-
vince of Lahor, and the countries on the banks

of

of the Indus from Moultan to the sea. These, s E C T.
however, were surveyed with that degree of
accuracy which I have already described; and
it is a circumstance not unworthy of notice,
that this distri of India which Europeans firfl
entered, and ith which they were belt ac-
quainted in ancient times, is now less known
than almolt any part of that continent , neither
commerce nor war, to which, in every age,
geography is chiefly indebted for its improve-
ment, having led any nation of Europe to fre-
quent or explore it.

IF an untimely death had not put a period

to the reign of the Macedonian hero, India,
we have reaisn to think, would have been more
fully explored by the ancients, and the Euro-
pean dominion would have been established
there two thousand years sooner. When Al.
exander invaded India, he had omething more
in view than a transient incursion. It was his
object to annex that extensive and opulent
country to his empire, and though the refrac-
tory spirit of his army obliged him, at that
time, to suspend the prosecution of his plan,
he was far from relinquilhing it. To exhibit
a general view of the measures which he adopt-
ed for this purpose, and to point out their pro.
priety and probable fuccels, is not foreign
from the fubjecl of this Dilquifition, and will
convey a more just idea than is usually enter-
tained, of the original genius and extent of
political wisdom which diftinguiihed this illus-
trious man.

WHEN Alexander became master of the Per-
fian empire, he easily perceived, that with all

the

21

S E C T. the power of his hereditary dominions, re-in-

I. forced by the troops which the ascendant he
"-- had acquired over the various itates of Greece

might enable him to raise there, he could not
hoe to etain in fubject-n territories so
extensive an f. populous; that to render his
authority fccure and permanent, it must be
efiablifhed in the affedion of the nations which
he had subdued, and maintained by their arms;
and that in order to acquire this advantage, all
diflinicns between the victors and vanquished
must be a!olifhed and his European and Asiatic
fubjets muit be incorporated, and become one
people, by obeying the lame laws, and by
adopting the fame manners, institutions, and
discipline.

LIBERAL as this plan of policy was, and

well adapted to accomplish what he had in view,
nothing could be more repugnant to the ideas
and prejudices o his countrymen. The Greeks
had such an high opinion of the pre-eminence
to which they were raised by civilization and
science, that they seem hardly to have ac-
knowledged the reft of mankind to be of the
fame species with themselves. To every other
people they gave the degrading appellation of
Barbarians: and, in consequence of their boasted
fuperioritv, they asserted a right of dominion
over them, in the fame manner as the foul has
over the body, and men have over irrational
animals. Extravagant as this pretension may
now appear. it found admission, to the disgrace
of ancient philosophy, into all the schools.
Aristotle, full of this opinion, in support of
which he employs arguments more subtle than
solid °, advised Alexander to govern the Greeks

? Ari2ct. Polit. i.c. -.-

like

like fubjets, and the Barbarians as saves; to S E C T.
confider the former as companions, the latter I
as creatures of an inferior nature . But the --
sentiments of the pupil were more enlarged
than those of his matter, and his experience in
governing men taught the monarch wt.at the
speculative science of the philolopher did not
discover. Soon after the vittory at Arbela,
Alexander hihufelf, and by his persuasion many
of his officers, assumed the Persian dress, and
conformed to several of their customs. At the
lame time he encouraged the Persian nobles to
imitate the manners of the Macedonians, to
learn the Greek language, and to acquire a
relith for the beauties of the elegant writers in
that tongue, which were then universally studied
and admired. In order to render the union
more complete, he resolved to marry one of
the daughters of Darius, and chose wives for a
hundred of his principal officers in the moit
illustrious Persian families. '1heir nuptials
were celebrated with great pomp and feitivity,
and with high exultation of the conquered
people. In imitation of them, above ten thou-
sand Macedonians of inferior rank married Per-
fian women, to each of whom Alexander gave
nuptial presents, as a testimony of his appro-
bation of their condut& .

BUT assiduously as Alexander laboured to

unite his European and Asiatic fuhjects by the
most indifioluble ties, he did not trust entirely
to the fuccels of that measure for the security of
his new conquests. In every province which
he subdued, he made choice of proper stations,

where

S E C T. where he built and fortified cities, in which

I- he placed garrisons, composed partly of such of
-- the natives as citormed to the Grecian man-
= ners and discipline. and partly of such of his

European sub- ts, as were worn out with the
fatigues of fr ice, and xvifhed-for repose, and
a permanent etiablifhment. These cities were
numerous, and served not only as a chain of
polls to keep open the communication between
the different provinces of his dominions, but as
places of strength to over-awe and curb the
conquered people. Thirty thousand of his new
subjects xwho had been disciplined in these cities,
and armed after the European fashion, appeared
before Alexander in Susa, and were formed by
him into that compact slid body of infantry,
known Vb the name of the Phalanx, which con-
ftituted the Itrength of a Macedonian army.
But in order to secure entire authority over this
new corps, as well as to render it more effecive,
he appointed that every officer in it entrusted
wirt command, either superior or subaltern,
houil. be European. As the ingenuity of
mankind naturally has recourse in similar fitua-
ticrn to the fame expedients, the European
pewers, who now in their Indian territories em-
p!cy numerous bodies of the natives in their
service, have, in forming the eftablilhment of
these troops, adopted the fame maxims; and,
probably without kowing it, have modelled
their battalions of Seapoys upon the fame prin-
ciples as Alexander did his Phalanx of Persians.

THE farther Alexander pushed his conquefls

from the banks of the Euphrates, which may
be confidered as the center of his dominions,
he found it necTary to build and to fortify a
greater number of cities. Several of these to
the Eatl and South of the Caspian sea are men-

tioned
24

tioned by ancient authors; and in India itself, S E C T.
he founded two cities on the banks of the Hy-
dafpes, and a third on the Acefines, both navi-
gable rivers, which, after uniting their streams,
tall into the Indus P. From the choice of such
situations, it is obvious that he intended, by
means of there cities, to keep open a commu-
nication with India, not only by land, but by
sea. It was chiefly with a view to the latter of
these objets, (as I have already observed,)
that he examined the navigation of the Indus
with so much attention. With the fame view,
on his return to Susa, he, in person. surveyed
the course of the Euphrates and Tigris, and
gave directions to remove the cataracts or dams,
with which the ancient monarchs of Persia, in-
duced by a peculiar precept of their religion,
which enjoined them to guard with the utmost
care againIt defiling any of the elements, had
conftruEted near the mouths of these rivers, in
order to shut out their fubjets from any access
to the ocean . By opening the navigation in
this manner, he proposed, that the valuable
commodities of India should be conveyed from
the Persian Gulf into the interior parts of his
Asiatic dominions, while by the Arabian Gulf
they mhould be carried to Alexandria, and diftri-
buted to the reft of the world.

GRAND and extensive as these schemes were,

the precautions employed, and the arrange-
ments made for carrying them into execution,
were so various and so proper, that Alexander
had good realon to entertain sanguine hopes of
their proving luccefsful. At the time when
the mutinous spirit of his soldiers obliged him

to

25

S E C T. to relinquish his operations in India, he was

I. not thirty vears of age complete. At this en-

r erprizing period of life, a prince, of a spirit
so active, perfeverilg, and indefatigable, muff
have loon found means to resume a favourite
measure on which he had been long intent. If
he had invaded India a second time, he would
not, as formerly, have been obliged to force
his wav through hostile and unexplored regions,
opposed at every ftep by nations and tribes of
Barbarians, whole names had never reached
Greece. All Asia, from the hores of the
Ionian sea to the banks of the Hyphafis, would
thsn have been subject to his dominion; and
through that immense firetch of country he had
established such a chain of cities, or fortified
stations', that his armies might have continued
their march with fafetv, and have found a re-
gular fuccelfion of magazines provided for their
subsistence. Nor would it have been difficult
for him to bring into the field forces sufficient
to have atchieved the conquest of a country so
populous and extensive as India. Having armed
and disciplined his fubjeas in the Ealt like
Europeans, they would have been ambitious
to imitate and to equal their inftrutors, and A-
lexander might have drawn recruits,not from his
fcantv domains in Macedonia and Greece, but
irom the vast regions of Asia, which, in every
dge, has covered the earth, and aoniffed
mankind with its numerous armies. When at
the head of such a formidable power he had
reached the confines of India, he might have
entered it under circumstances very different
irom those in his first expedition. He had e-
cured a firm footing there, partly by means of
:he garrisons which he left in the three cities

r -e NOTE X.

which

which he had built and fortified, and partly by S E C T.
his alliance with T'axiles and Porus. These 1
two Indian princes, won by Alexander's hu-
manity and beneficence, which, as they were
virtues seldom displayed in the ancient mode of
carrying on war, excited of course an higher
degree of admiration and gratitude, had con-
tinued steady in their attachment to the Mace-
donians. Re-inforced by their troops, and
guided by their information as well as by the
experience which he had acquired in his for-
mer campaigns, Alexander must have made
rapid progress in a country, where every inva-
der, from his time to the present age, has proved
successful.

BUT this and all his other splendid schemes

were terminated at once by his untimely death.
In consequence of that, however, events took
place, which illustrate and confirm the jutnefs
of the preceding speculations and conjecures
by evidence the most striking and fatisfatory.
When that great empire, which the superior
genius of Alexander had kept united and in
fubje&ion, no longer felt his superintending
controul, it broke into pieces, and its various
provinces were seized by his principal officers,
and parcelled out among them. From ambi-
tion, emulation, and personal animosity, they
loon turned their arms againit one another;
and as several of the leaders were equally emi-
nent for political abilities and for military skill,
the contest was maintained long, and carried
on with frequent vicissitudes of fortune. Amidst
the various convulsions and revolutions which
these occasioned, it was found that the mea-
fures of Alexander for the preservation of his
conqueits had been concerted with such saga-
city, that upon the final reftoraion of tranquility,

the

27

S E C T. the Macedonian dominion continued to be

I. eitablifhed in every part of Asia, and not one
1 -' province had haken off the yoke. Even India,

the molt remote of Alexander's conquests,
quietly submitted to Pytho the son of Agenor,
and afterwards to Seleucus, ho fuccellively
obtained dominion over that part of Asia. Po-
rus and Taxiles, notwi:hftanding the death of
their benefactor, neither declined submission to
the authority of the Macedonians, nor made
any attempt to recover independence.

DU-RING the contefls for power and fuperi-

oritv among the successors of Alexander, Se-
leucus, who. in every effort of enterprising am-
bition, was inferior to none of them, having
rendered himself master of all the provinces of
the Persian empire comprehended under the
name of Upper Asia, confidered those countries
of India which had been subdued by Alexander,
as belonging to that portion of the Macedonian
empire of which he was now the overeign.
Seleucus, like all the officers formed under
Alexander, entertained such high ideas of the
advantages which might be derived from a com-
mercial intercourse with India, as induced him
to march into that country, partly with
a view of establishing his own authority
there, and partly in order to curb San-
dracottus, who having lately acquired the so-
vereignty of the Prafij, a powerful nation on
the banks of the Ganges, threatened to attack
the Mlacedonians, whose Indian territories bor-
dered on his dominions. Unfortunately, no
account of this expedition, which seems to have
been splendid and successful, has reached our
times. All we know of it is, that he advanced
considerably beyond the utmost boundary of

Alexander's

Alexander's progress in India ', and would pro- S E C T.
bably have proceeded much farther if he had _
not been constrained to flop short in his career
in order to oppose Antigonus, who was prepar-
ing to invade his dominions at the head of a
formidable army. Before he begun his march
towards the Euphrates, he concluded a treaty
with Sandracottus; in consequence of which.
that monarch quietly retained the kingdom he
had acquired. But the power and pofeflions of
the Macedonians seem to have remained unim-
paired during the reign of Seleucus, which ter-
minated forty-two years after the death of
Alexander.

WITH a view of cultivating the friendly in-

tercourfe with Sandracottus, Seleucus made
choice of Mlegafthenes, an officer, who, from
his having accompanied Alexander in his expe-
dition into India, had some knowledge of the
fRare of the country, and the manners of its in-
habitants, and sent him as his ambassador to
Palibothra'. In this famous capital of the
Prafij, lituated on the banks of the Ganges,
Megafthenes resided several years, and was pro-
bably the first European who ever beheld that
mighty river, far superior to any of the ancient
continent in magnitude", and no less diftin
guifsed by the fertility of the countrythrough
which it flows. This journey of Megafthenes
to Palibothra made Europeans acquainted with
a large extent of country, of which they had
not hitherto any knowledge; for Alexander did
not advance farther towards the south-east, than
that part of the river Hydraotes or Rauvee,
where the modern city of Lahore is situated, and

AN HISTORICAL DISQUISITION
S E C T. Palibothra, the site of which, as it is a capital

I- poition in the geography of ancient India, I

have inveaigated with the utmost attention, ap-
pears to me the fame with that of the modern
city of Allahabad, at the confluence of the two
great rivers, Jumna and Ganges . As the road
from Lahore to Allahabad runs through some of
the noL; cultivated and opulent provinces of In-
dia, the more the country was explored, the
idea of its value rose higher. Accordingly,
what Megafthenes observed during his progrels
to Palibothra, and his residence there, made
such an impreflion upon his own mind, as in-
duced him to publiff an ample account of India,
in order to make his countrymen more tho-
roughly acquainted with its importance. From
his writings the ancients seem to have derived
alnolt all their knowledge of the interior state
of India, and from comparing the three most
ample acounts of it, by Diodorus Siculus,
Strabo, and Arrian, they appear manifestly,
from their near resemblance, to be a transcript
of his words. But, unfortunately, Megafthe-
nes was so fond of the marvellous, that he ming-
led with the truths which he related many ex-
travagant fidions; and to him may be traced up
the fabulous tales of men with ears so large that
they could wrap themselves up in them, and of
others with a single eye, without mouths, with-
out noses, with long feet, and toes turned back.

when they are supported by internal evidence, I
and confirmed by the teflimony of other ancient
authors, or when they coincide with the expe-
rience of modern times. His account, however,
of the diimenfions and geography of India, is
curious and accurate. His description of the
power and opulence of the Prafij perfectly re-
fembles that which might have been given of
tome of the greater states in the modern Indof-
tan, before the ectablifhment of the Mahomedan
or European power in India, and is consonant
to the accounts which Alexander had received
concerning that people. He was informed that
they were ready to oppose him on the banks of
the Ganges, with an army confifling of twenty
thousand cavalry, two hundred thousand infan-
try, and two thousand armed chariots ; and
Mvegafthenes relates, that he had an audience oi
Sandracottus in a place where he was encamped
with anarmyof fourhundredthoufandmein . The
enormous dimensions which he assigns to Pali-
bothra, of no less than ten miles in length, and
two in breadth, and surrounded by walls in
which there were five hundred and seventy tow-
ers, and fixty-four gates, would probably have
been ranked by Europeans among the wonders
which he delighted to relate, if they were not
now well acquainted with the rambling manner
in which the cities of India are built, and did
not know with certainty that, both in former
and in the present times, it might boast of cities
still more extensive .

of the Syrian monarchs with India, of which
we have anv account . Nor can we either fix
with accuracy the time, or describe the manner
in which their possessions in India were wrested
from them. It is probable that they were o-
blied to abandon that country soon after the
death of Scleucus'.

B-T though the great monarchs of Syria loft,

about this period those provinces in India
which had ben subjet to their dominion, the
Greeks in a fnaller kingdom, composed of some
fraTm:ent. of Alexandcr's empire, still main-
tained an intercourse with India, and even made
some considerable acquiiition of territory there.
This was the kingdom of Baaria, originally
subjea to Seieucus, but wrested from his son or
grandson, and rendered an independent slate,
about fixty-nine years after the death of Alex-
ander. Concerning the transactions of this
kingdom, we must reft satisfied with gleaning a
few imperfect hints in ancient authors. From
them we learn that its commerce with India was
great; and the conqueits of the Badrian kings
in that country were more extensive than those
of Alexander himself, and particularly that they
recovered pofeffion of the diftri& near the
mouth of the Indus, which he had subduedd.
Each of the fix princes who reigned in Bafria,
carried on military operations in India with such
success, that they penetrated far into the interior
part of the country, and proud of the conquests
which they had made, as well as of the extensive
dominions over which they reigned, some of

them assumed the lofty title of Great King, S E C T.
which diftinguithed the Persian monarchs in the I
days of their highest splendour. But we should
not have known how long this kingdom of Bac-
tria subsisted, or in what manner it terminated,
if M. de Guignes had not called in the hiltorians
of China to supply the defects of the Greek and
Roman writers. By them we are informed.

before the Christian ara, a powerful horde of
Tartars, puihed from their native feats on the
confines of China, and obliged to move to-
wards the well by the pressure of a more nume-
rous body that rolled on behind them, passed
the Jaxartes, and pouring in upon Badria, like
an irresistible torrent, overwhelmed that king-
dom, and put an end to the doninion of the
c Greeks there, after it had been established near
one hundred and thirty years .

FROM this time until the close of the fifteenth

century, when the Portuguese, by doubling the
Cape of Good Hope, opened a new communi-
cation with theEaft, and carried their vitorious
arms into every part of India, no European
power acquired territory, or etablifhed its
dominion there, During this long period, of
more than sixteen hundred years, all schemes of
conque:t in India seem to have been totally relin-
quillled, and nothing more was aimed at by any
nation, than to ecure an intercourse of trade
with that opulent country.

IT was in Egypt that the feat of this inter-

course was established; and it is not without
surprise that we observe how soon and how reO

S E C T gularlv the commerce of the East came to be

I carried on by that channel, in which the saga-

city of Alexander deltined it to flow. Ptolemy,
the son of Lagus, as soon as he took poffefion
of Egypt, etablifhed the feat of government in
Alexandria. By ome exertions of authority,
and many as of liberality, but chiefly by the
fame of his mild and equal administration, he
drew :uch a number of inhabitants to this fa-
vourite residence, that it soon became a popu-
lous and wealthy city. As Ptolemy deserved and
had poffelTed the confidence of Alexander more
perfectiv than any of his officers, he knew well
that his chief obje& in founding Alexandria was
to fccure the advantages arising from the trade
with India. A long and prosperous reign was
favourable to the prosecution of that object, and
though ancient authors have not enabled us to
trace the steps which the first Ptolemy took for
this purpose, we have a triking evidence of his
extraordinary attention to naval affairs, in his
erecting the light-houir on the island of Pharos,
at the mouth of the harbour of Alexandria , a
work of such magnificence as to be reckoned
one of the seven wonders of the world. With
relpect to the commercial arrangements of his
Ion Ptolemy Philadelphus, we have more perse&
information. In order to bring the trade with
India (which began to revive at Tyre, its anci-
ent station ,) to centre in Alexandria, he set
abiuut io ming a canal, an hundred cubits in
breadth, and thirty cupits in depth, between
Arfince on the Red Sea, not far from the fitua-
tion of the modern Suez, and the Pelufiac or
eastern branch of the Nile, by means of which
the producions of India might have been con-

veyed to that capital wholly by water. But ei- S E C T.
ther on account of fomedangerapprehendedfrom
completing it, that work was never finished; or
from the flow and dangerous navigation to.
wards the northern extremity of the Red Sea,
this canal was found to be of so little use, that
in order to facilitate the communication with
India, he built a city on the weft coast of that
sea, almost under the Tropic, to which he gave
the name of Berenice'. This new city soon
became the flaple of the trade with Indiak.
From Berenice the goods were transported by
land to Coptos, a city three miles diflant from
the Nile, but which had a communication with
that river by a navigable canal, of which there
are still some remains ', and thence carried down
the stream toAlexandria. The distance between
Berenice and Coptos was, according to Pliny,
two hundred and fifty-eight Roman miles, and
the road lay through the defart of Thebais, al-
most entirely destitute of water. But the at-
tention of a powerful monarch made provision
for supplying this want, by searching for springs,
and wherever there were found he built inns,
or more probably in the eastern ile caravanfe-
ras, for the accommodation of merchants '. In
this channel the intercourse between theEaft and
Weft continued to be carried on during two
hundred and fifty years, as long as Egypt re-
mained an independent kingdom.

THE hips deflined for India took their de-

parture from Berenice, and failing, according
to the ancient mode of navigation, along the
Arabian hore, to the promontory Syagrus (now

. coalt of Persia, either directly to Pattata (now

.'" Tlatta) at the head of the lower Delta of the

Indus, or to some other emporium on the weft
coast of India. To this part of India which
Alexander had visited and subdued, the com-
merce under the protection of the gyptian
monarchs seems to have been confined or a
considerable time. Afterwards a more conve-
nient course was followed, and from Cape Ra-
falgate vessels failed in a direc course to Zizerus.
This, according to M. de Montesquieu", was
the kingdom of Sigertis, on the sea coast adja-
cent to the mouth of the Indus, conquered by
the Greek monarchs of Bactria; according to
Major Rennell , it was a port on the north-
ern part of the Malabar coast. Ancient authors
have not conveyed such information as will ena-
ble us to pronounce with certainty, which of
those two opposite opinions is best founded.
Nor can we point out with accuracy, what
were the other ports in India which the mer-
chants from Berenice frequented, when that
trade was first opened. As they failed in vessels
of small burden, which crept timidly along the
coast, it is probable that their voyages were
circumscribed within very narrow limits, and
that under the Ptolemies no considerable pro-
grefs was made in the discovery of India P.

FROM. this monopoly of the commerce by sea

between the east and meft, which Egypt lon
enjoyed, it derived that extraordinary degree f

rivalhip, there is hardly any circumstance in S E C T.
ancient history which appears more furpriling, 1*
than that the sovereigns of Egypt should have
been permitted to engross this lucrative trade
without competition, or any attempt to wret it
out of their hands; epecially as the powerful
monarchs of Syria might, from the Perlian
Gulf, have carried on an intercourse with the
fame parts of India, by a horter and safer course
of navigation. Different considerations seem to
have induced them so tamely to relinquih all
the obvious advantages of this commerce. The
kings of Egypt, by their attention to maritime
affairs, had formed a powerful fleet, which gave
them such decided command of the lea, that
they could have cruflied with cafe any rival in
trade. No commercial intercourse teems ever
to have been carried on by sea between Periia
and India. The Persians had such an infupera-
ble aversion to that element, or were- lo much
afraid of foreign invasion, that their monarchs
(as I have already observed) obltruced the na-
vigation of the great rivers, which gave access
to the interior parts of the country, by artificial
works. As their fubjetts, however, were no
less desirous than the people around, them, to
possess the valuable producions and elegant ma-
nufacures of India, these were conveyed to all
the parts of their extensive dominions by land-
carriage. The commodities deflined for the
supply of the northern provinces, were tranf-
ported on camels from the banks of the Indus to
those of the Oxus, down the ftreamn of which
they were carried to the Caspian sea, and diftri-
buted, partly by land-carriage and partly by na.
vigable rivers, through the different countries,
bounded on the one hand by the Caspian, and
on the other by the Euxine lea '. The comillo-

S E C T. dities of India intended for the southern and in-

I- terior provinces, proceeded by land from the

Caspian gates to some of the great rivers, by
which they were circulated through every part
of the country. This was the ancient mode of
intercourse with India, while the Persian empire
was governed by its native princes; and it has
bjen observed in every age, that when any
branch of commerce has got into a certain
channel, although it may be neither the most
proper nor the most commodious one, it requires
long time, and considerable efforts, to give it a
different direction.

To all these reasons for suffering the monarchs

of Egypt to continue in the undisturbed pof-
session of the trade with India by sea, another
may be added. Many of the ancients, by an
error in geography extremely unaccountable,
and in which they persisted. notwithstanding re-
peated opportuniti . f obtaining more accurate
information, be', '.-d the Caspian lea to be a
branch of the great Northern Ocean, and the
kings of )yria might hope by that means to open
a communication with Europe, and to circulate
through it the valuable productions of the East,
without intruding into those seas, the navigation
of which the Egyptian monarchs seemed to con-
iider as their exclusive right. This idea had
been formed by the Greeks, when they became
masters of Asia. Seleucus Nicator, the firti
and most sagacious of the Syrian kings, at the
time when he was affainated, entertainec
thoughts of forming a junction between the
Caspian and Euxine seas by a canal', and i

this could have been effeted, his fubjeds, be- S E C T.
fides the extension of their trade in Europe, 1-
might have supplied all the countries in theNorth
of Asia, on the coait of the Euxine lea, as well
as many of those which retch eastward from
the Caspian, with the productions of India. As
those countries, though now thinly inhali:cd
by a miserable race of men, destitute of indus-
try and of wealth, were in ancient times ex-
tremely populous, and filled with great and opu-
lent cities, this must have been cunfidered as a
branch of commerce of such magnitude and
value, as to render the securing of it an object
worthy the attention of the molt powerful mo.
narch.

BUT while the monarchs of Egypt and Syria

laboured with emulation and ardour to secure to
their fubjeds all the advantages of the Indian
trade, a power arose in the Welt which proved
fatal to both. The Romans, by the vigour of
their military institutions, and the wisdom of
their political conduct, having rendered theln-
selves matters of all Italy and Sicily, ioon over-
turned the rival rpublic of Carthage, subjected
Macedonia and' tOce, extended their domi-

Alexander the Great. A fter a series of events,
which belong not to the ubjec of this Difquifi-
tion, Egypt Was annexed to the 1'oman em-
pire, and reduced into the form of a Roman
province by Augustus. Aware of its great
importance, he, with that provident sagacity
which distinguishes his character, not only re-
served it as one of the provinces fubj-ccc in-

precautions, well known to every scholar, pro-

on which the capital dpended for fubfiflence,
but as ile feat of th._ lucrative commerce which
had enabled its ancient monarchs to amass such

envy of other princes, and produced, when
brought into the treasury of the empire, an al-
teration in the value of property, and the Itate
of manners, in Rome itfeif.

commerce with India increased to a degree,
which 'as I have observed in another place')
will appear astonishing even to the present age,
in which that branch of trade has been extended
far beyond the practice or conception of any
former period.

BES!IES the Indian commodities imported

into the capital of the empire from Egypt, the
Romans received an additional supply of them
by another mode of conveyance. From the
earliest times, there seems to have been some
communication between Mesopotamia, and other
provinces on the banks of the Euphrates, and
those parts of Syria and Palefline, which lay
near the Mediterranean. 'the migration of
Abram from Ur, of the Chaldees to Sichem in
the land of Canaan, is an initance of this b.
The journey through the defart, which fepa-
rated these countries, was much facilitated by
its affording a flation abounding with water, and
capable of cultivation. As the intercourse in-
creaed, the poffeTfion of this station became an
object of so much importance, that Solomon,
when he turned his attention towards the exten-
sion of commerce among his fubjeds, built a
fenced city there '. Its Syrian name of Tadmor
in the wilderness, and its Greek one of Palmyra,
are both descriptive of its situation in a spot a.
domned with palm-trees. This is plentifully sup-
plied with water, and surrounded by a portion

of fertile land, and (though of no great extent S E C T.
render it a delightful habitation in the midlt of [I.
barren sands and an inhospitable defart. Its hap- '~
py position, at the distance of little more than
sixty miles from the river Euphrates, and of two
hundred and three miles from the nearest coast
of the Mediterranean, induced its inhabitants
to enter with ardour into the trade of conveying
commodities from one of these to the other.
As the molt valuable productions of India,
brought up the Euphrates from the PerfianGulf,
are of such fall bulk as to bear the expence of
a long land-carriage, this trade soon became so
considerable that the opulence and power of
Palmyra increased rapidly. Its government was
of the form which is best suited to the genius
of a commercial city, republican; and from the
peculiar advantages of its situation, as well as
the spirit of its inhabitants, it long maintained
its independence, though furrou: ded by power-
ful and ambitious neighbours. Under the Sy-
rian monarchs descendcd from Seleucus it at-
tained to its highest degree of plendour and
wealth, one great source of which seems to have
been the supplying their fubjets with Indian
commodities. When Syria fbmitted to the ir-
resistible arms of Rome, Palmyra continued
upwards of two centuries a free state, and its
friendflip was courted with emulation and soli-
citude by the Romans, and their rivals for em-
pire, the Parthians. That it traded with both,
particularly that from it the capital, as well as
other parts of the empire received the produc-
tions of India, we learn from Appian, an au-
thor of good credit . But in tracing the pro-
grefs of the commerce of the ancients with the

v- 1 gular difcoverv, for which we are indebted to

the liberal curiosity and enterprizing spirit of
our own countrymen, did not confirm and illus-
trate what he relates. Towards the close of the
last century, btme gentlemen of the English
faitorv at Aleppo, incited by what they heard
in the East concerning the wonderful ruins of
Palmyra, ventured, notwithstanding the great
fatigue and danger of a journey through the de-
fart, to vilit them. To their aftonithment they
beheld a fertile spot of some miles in extent,
arising from an island out of a vast plain of
sand, cos tred with the remains of temples, por-
ticoes, aqueducts, and other public works,
which in magnificence and splendour, and some
of them in elegance, were not unworthy of A-
thens or of Rome in their most prosperous slate.
Allured by their description of them, about sixty
years thereafter, a party of more enlightened
travellers, having reviewed the ruins of Palmyra
with greater attention and more scientific fiill,
declared that what they beheld there exceeded
the molt exalted ideas which they had formed
concerning it ..

co!lecting the extraordinary degree of power to
which Palm:ra had attained, when Egypt, Sy-
ria, M.cfoptaiila, and a considerable part of
.A a Minor were conquered by his arms; when

From its original territory, must have owed its S E c T.
iggrandizement to the opulence acquired by "i
:xtenfive commerce. Of this the Indian trade
was undoubtedly the most considerable, and
molt lucrative branch. But it is a cruel morti-
fication, in earching for what is initrucqive in
the hiltory of pal times, to find that the ex-
ploits of conquerors who have delbiated the
earth, and the freaks of tyrants who have ren-
dered nations unhappy, are recorded with mi-
nute, and often disgusting accuracy, while the
discovery of useful arts, and the progress of the
molt beneficial branches of commerce, are pafied
over in silence, and suffered to fink into ob-
livion.

ATTER the conquest of Palmyra by Aurelian,

trade never revived there. At precent a few mi-
ferable huts of beggarly Arabs are scattered in
the courts of its stately temples, or deform its
elegant porticoes; and exhibit an humiliating
contrail to its ancient magnificence.

BUT while the merchants of Egypt and Sy-

ria exerted their aci\ ity in order to supply the
increasing demands of Rome for Indian commo-
dities, and vied with each otlrhr in their efforts,
the eagerness of gain (as Fliny o'ferves) brought
India itself nearer to the relt of the world. In
the course of their voyages to that country,
the Greek and Egyptian pilots could not fail to
observe the regular shifting of the periodical
winds or monsoons, and how steadily they con-
tinued to blow during one part of the year from
the East, and during the other from the Weft.
Encouraged by attending to this circumstance,
Hippalus, the cornmander of a ship engaged in
the Indian trade, ventured, about four-score
years after Egypt was annexed to the Roman

empire,

boldly from the mouth of the Arabian Gulf a.

monsoon to Mufiris, a harbour in that part of
India, now known by the name of the Malabar
coat.

T rs route to India was held to be a discovery

of fu:h importance, that in order to perpetuate
the memory of the inventor, the name of Hip-
palus was given to the wind which enabled him
to perform the voyage . As this was one of
the greatest efforts of navigation in the ancient
world, and opened the belt communication by
sea between the East and Weft that was known
for fourteen hundred years, it merits a particu-
lar description. Fortunately Pliny has enabled
us to give it with a degree of accuracy, which
can seldom be attained in tracing the naval or
commercial operations of the ancients. From
Alexandria (he obterves) to Juliopolus is two
miles; there the cargo destined for India is em-
barked on the Nile, and is carried to Coptos,
which is distant three hundred and three miles,
and the voyage is usually accomplished in twelve
days. From Coptos goods are conveyed to Be-
renice on the Arabian Gulf, halting at different
stations regulated according to the conveniency
of watering. The distance between these
cities is two hundred and fifty-eight miles. On
account of the heat, the caravan travels only
during the night, and the journey is finished on
the twelfth day. From Berenice, hips take
their departure about midsummer, and in thirty
davs reach Ocelis (Gella) at the mouth of the
Arabian Gulf, or Cane (Cape Fartaque) on the

coast of Arabia Felix. Thence they fail in s E CT.
forty days to Mufiris, the sirs emporium in In- .1
dia. They begin their voyage homewards early
in the Egyptian month Thibi, which answers to
our December; they fail with a north-east wind,
and when they enter the Arabian Gulf meet
with a south or south weRl wind, and thus
complete the voyage in less than a year ,.

THE account which Pliny gives of Mufiris,

and of Barace, another harbour not far distant,
which was likewise frequented by the hips from
Berenice, as being both so incommodious for
trade-on account of the fhallowncfs of the ports,
that it became necessary to discharge and take in
the cargoes in small boats, does not enable us
to fix their position with perfect accuracy. This
description applies to many ports on the Mala.
bar coast, but from two circumstances men-
tioned by him; that they are not far dillant
from Cottonara, the country which produces
pepper in great abundance; and the other, that
in failing towards them the course lay near Ni-
trias, the station of the pirates ; I adopt the
opinion of Major Rennell, that they were situ-
ated somewhere between Goa and Tellichery,
and that probably the modern Meerzaw or Mer-
jee is the Mufiris of the ancients, and Barcelore
their Barace ".

As in these two ports was the principal staple

of the trade between Egypt and India, when in
its most flourilhing fRate, this seems to be the
proper place for inquiring into the nature of
the commerce which the ancients, particularly
the Ronans, carried on with that country, and

for

47

S E C T. for enumerating the commodities most in re-

IL quefl, which they imported from it. But as the

operations of commerce, and the mode of re-
gulating it, were little attended to in those tates
of antiquity, of whose tranfacions we have any
accurate knowledge; their historians hardly
enter into any detail concerning a fubjecl of
such subordinate importance in their political
fyitem, 2nd it is mostly from brief hints, de-
tached fads, and incidental observations, that
we can gather information concerning it'.

IN every age, it has been a commerce

of luxury, rather than of neceiity, which has
been carried on between Europe and India.
Its elegant manufactures, spices, and preci-
ous tones, are neither objects of desire to na-
tions of simple manners, nor are such nati-
ons possessed of wealth sufficient to purchase
them. But at the time the Romans became
maiters of the Indian trade, they were not
only (as I have already observed) in that stage
of iocietv w-hen men are eager to obtain e-
very thing that can render the enjoyment of
life more exquisite, or add to its splendour,
but they had acquired all the fantastic taftes
formed by the caprice and extravagance of
wealth. They were of consequence highly
delighted with those new objects of gratifica-
tion with which India supplied them in such
abundance. The productions of that country,
natural as well as artificial, seem to have been
much the fame in that age as in the present.
But the taste of the Romans in luxury differed
in many respects from that of modern times,
and of course their demands from India differed
considerably from ours.

i Se NOTE XX.

IN order to convey an idea of their demands q E C T.

as complete as potlible, I shall in the firit place II1
make some observations on the three great ar- ,'
tides of general importation from India. . Spices
and aromatics. 2. Precious tones and pearls.
3. Silk. And then I hall give Ibme account
(as far as I can venture to do it from authentic
information) of the afortment of cargoes, both
outward and homeward bound, for the veftels
fitted out at Berenice for different ports of
India.

I. SPICES and aromatics. Fr, m the mode

of religious worship in the heathen world;
from the incredible number of their deities,
and of the temples consecrated to them; the
consumption of frankincense and other aroma-
tics which were used in every sacred function,
mufft have been very great. But the vanity of
men occasioned a greater consumption of those
fragrant substances than their piety. It was
the custom of the Romans to burn the bodies
of their dead, and they deemed it a display of
magnificence, to cover, not only the body but
the funeral pile on which it was laid, with the
molt coffly spices. At the funeral of Syila,
two hundred and ten burthens of ipices were
itrewed upon the pile. Nero is reported to
have burnt a quantity of cinnamon and caliia
at the funeral of Pappca, greater than the
countries from which it was imported produced
in one year. We confunme in heaps these pre-
cious fubltances with the carcases of the dead
(fays Pliny :) We oiler them to the Gods only
in grains . It was not from India, I am aware,
but from Arabia, that aromatics \\ere first im-
ported into Europe; and some of them, parti-

cularly

S E C T. cularly frankincense, were producions of that

I. country. But the Arabians were accustomed,

together with spices of native growth, to fur-
nih foreign merchants with others of higher
value, which they brought from India, and the
regions beyond it. The commercial intercourse
of the Arabians with the Eastern parts of Asia,
was not only early (as has been already ob-
served) but considerable. By means of their
trading caravans, they conveyed into their own
country all the valuable productions of the East,
among which, spices held a chief place. In
every ancient account of Indian commodities,
spices and arromatics of various kinds form a
principal article'. Some authors aftert that the
greater part of those purchased in Arabia were
not the growth of that country, but brought
from India . That this assertion was well-
founded, appears from what has been observed
in modern times. The frankincense of Arabia,
though reckoned the peculiar and most precious
production of the country, is much inferior
in quality to that imported into it from the
East; and it is chiefly with the latter that the
Arabians at present supply the extensive de-
mands of various provinces of Asia for this
commodity ". It is upon good authority, then,
that I have mentioned the importation of spices
as one of the molt considerable branches of an.
cient commerce with India.

II. PRECIOUS tones, together with which

pearls may be classed, seem to be the article
next in value imported by the Romans from
the East As these have no pretension to be
of any real use, their value arises entirely from

their

their beauty and their rarity, and even when E C T.
estimated moit moderately is always high. But 11
among nations far advanced in luxury, when J
they are deemed not only ornaments but
marks of distinction, the vain and the opulent
vie so eagerly with one another for the pof.
session of them, that they rife in price to an
exorbitant and almost incredible height.
Diamonds, though the art of cutting them was
imperfecly known to the ancients, held an
high place in estimation among them as well
as among us. The comparative value of other
precious stones varied according to the diversity
of taltes and the caprice of fashion. The im-
mense number of them mentioned by Pliny,
and the laborious care with which he describes
and arranges them , will astonish, I should sup-
pose, the most skilful lapidary or jeweller of
modern times, and hews the high request in
whilh they were held by the Romans.

BUT among all the articles of luxury, the

Romans seem to have given the preference to
pearls . Persons of every rank purchased them
with eagerness ; they were worn on every part
of dress; and there is such a difference, both
in size and in value, among pearls, that while
such as were large and offuperior lutre adorned
the wealthy and the great, smaller ones, and
of inferior quality, gratified the vanity of per-
sons in more humble tations of life. Julius
Cafar presented Servilia, the mother of Brutus,
with a pearl, for which he paid forty-eight
thousand four hundred and fifty-feven pounds.
The famous pearl ear-rings of Cleopatra were
in value one hundred and fixty-one thousand

tries. a d all were ral:acKe. in order to gratify

the chief Dart, and its productions were allowed
to be molt abun-ant, diverlifled, and valuable.

III. AOTHER production of India in great

demand at Rome, was silk; and when we re-
collect the variety of ele-ant fabrics into which
it may be formed, anl how much these have
added to the fp!endour of dress and furniture,
we cannot wonder at its being held in such
eitimation bv a iuxn:ious people. The price
it bore was exorbitant; but it was deemed a
dress too expensive and too delicate for men',
and was appropriated wholly to women of emi-
nent rank and opulence. This, however, did
not render the demand for it less eager,
especially after the example of the dissolute
Elagabalus introduced the use of it among the
other sex, and accuilomed men to the disgrace
(as the feveritv of the ancient ideas accounted
it) of wearing this effeminate garb. Two cir-
cumftances concerning the traffic of silk among
the Romans merit observation. Contrary to
what usually takes place in the operations of
trade, the more general use of that commodity
seems not to have increased the quantity import-
ed, in such proportion as to answer the growing
demand for it, and the price of silk was not
reduced during the course of two hundred and
fifty years from the time of its being fir[t known
in Rome. In the reign of Aurelian, it still
continued to be valued at its weight in gold.

Tacit. Annal. lib. ii. c. 33.

Thi

This, it is probable. was owing to the mode in S E C T.
which that commodity was procured by the II-
merchants of Alexandria. They had no direat '-
intercourse with China, the only country in
which the fiik-worm was then reared, and its
labour rendered an article of commerce. All
the silk ,\hich they i urchafed in the different
ports of India which thev frequented, was
brought thither in hips of the country; and
either from foine def-ct of ikill in manag-
ing the silk-worm, the produce of its ingenious
indultry amont' the Chieie was scanty, or the
intermediate dealers found greater advantage in
furnishing the market of Alexandria with a
small quantity at an hi:h price, than to lower
its value I y increaling the qu:mitity. The other
circumstance hich 1 had in view, is more ex-
traordinary, and allords a triling proof of the
imperfect cnmuiication of the ancients with
remote nations, and of the flcnder knowledge
which they had of their natural productions or
arts. Much as the manufactures of silk were
admired, and often as filkl is mentioned by the
Greek and Roman authors, they had not for
several centuries after the ute of it became com-
mon, any certain knowledge ei!her of the coun-
tries to which they were indlebted for this fa-
vourite article of elegance, or of the manner in
which it was produced. By lome, silk was
supposed to be a fine down adhering to the
leaves of certain trees or flowers; others ima-
gined it to be a delicate pecies of wool or
cotton; and even thoie who had learned that
it was the work of an infect, hew, by their
descriptions, that they had no diftind idea of
the manner in which it was formed . It was
in consequence of an event that happened in

3 See NOTE XXIII.

the

53

S E C T. the fifth century of the Christian aera, of which

II. I hall hereafter ake notice, that the real nature
-*' of silk became known in Europe.

THE other commodities usually imported from

India, will be mentioned in the account, which
I now proceed to give, of the cargoes ent out
and brought home in the hips employed in
that trade. For this we are indebted to the
circumnaviga:ion of the Ervthran sea, ascribed
to Arrian, a curious though lhort treatise, les
known than it deserves to be, and which enters
into some details concerning commerce, to
which there is nothing similar in any ancient
writer. The firfl place in India, in which the
ships from Evpt, while they followed the an-
cient curse of navigation, were accustomed
to trade, was Patala in the river Indus. They
imported into it woollen cloth of a flight fabric,
linen in chequer work, some precious tfones,
and some aromatics unknown in India, coral,
storax, glass vessels of different kinds, some
wrought silver, money, and wine. n return
for these, they received spices of various kinds,
Sapphires, and other gems, silk fluffs, silk
thread, cotton cloths ', and black pepper. But
a far more considerable emporium on the fame
coast was Barygaza, and on that account the
author, whom I follow here, describes its fitua.
tion, and the mode of approaching it, with
great minuteness and accuracy. Its situation
corresponds entirely with that of Baroach, on
the great river Nerbuddah, down the fiteam of
which, or by land-carriage, from the great city
of Tagara across high mountains , all the pro-
duAtions of importation and exportation in this
great mart were extensive and various. Besides

these already mentioned, our author enumerates S E C T.
among the former, Italian, Greek and Arabian II.
wines, brass, tin, lead, girdles or fahes of cu-
rious texture, melilot, white glass, red arsenic,
black lead, gold and silver coin. Among the
exports he mentions the onyx, and other gems,
ivory, myrrh, various fabrics of cotton, both
plain and ornamented with flowers, and' long
pepper '. At Mufiris, the next emporium of
note on that coast, the articles impor!ed were
much the fame as at Barygaza; but as it lay
nearer to the eastern parts of India, and seems
to have had much communication with them,
the commodities exported from it were more
numerous and more valuable. He specifies
particularly pearls in great abundance and of
extraordinary beauty, a variety of silk fluffs,
rich perfumes, tortoise-shell, different kinds of
transparent gems, especially diamonds, and pep-
per in large quantities, and of the belt quality .

THE justness of the account given by this

author of the articles imported from India, is
confirmed by a Roman law, in which the Indian
commodities subjec to the payment of duties
are enumerated . By comparing these two ac-
counts, we may form an idea, tolerably exat,
of the nature and extent of the trade with India
in ancient times.

As the slate of society and manners among

the natives of India, in the earliest period in
which they are known, nearly resembled whar
we observe among their descendants in the pre-
sent age; their wants and demands were, of
course, much the fame. The ingenuity of

quauired, is in pic-g: s ; comprehending,
Lnjer that me:cantiie term, the inmenfe va-
rietv of fabrics, hich Indian ingenuity has
formed of cotton. Bu, as far as 1 have ob-
served, we have no authority that will justify
us in flating the ancient importation of these to
be in any degree considerable.

I. moJern times, though it continues still to

be chiefly a con.mercc of luxury that is carried
on with india, yet, together ith the articles
that ri;niier io it, we import, to a confidera-
ble excnt, arious comnmodities, which are to
be confidered merely as the materials of our
dcmedic n-anufactures. Such are the cotton-
wool of Indofian, the silk of China, and the
falt-perre of Bengal. But in the accounts
of ancient importations from India, raw silk
and filk-thread excepted, I find nothing men-
tioned that could serve as the materials of any
home-rmanufacture. The navigation of the an-

cients

cients never having extended to China, the S E C T.
quantity of unwrought silk with which they II
were supplied, by means of the Indian traders, v
appears to have been so scanty, that the ma-
nufacure of it could not make an addition of
any moment to their donietic indultry.

AFTER this fuccin& account of the commerce

carried on by the ancients in India, I proceed
to inquire what knowledge they had of the
countries beyond the ports of Muliris and
Barace, the utnoft boundary towards the Fast
to which I have hitherto traced their progress.
The Author of the Circumnavigation of the
Eryvhrzan Sea, whose accur;:-c of description
justifies the confidence with which I have follow-
ed him for some time, seems to have been little
acquainted with that part of the coast which
fretches from Barace towards the south. He
mentions, indeed, cur!orily, two or three dif-
ferent ports, but gives no intimation that any
of them were staples of the commerce with
Egypt. He hastens to Comar or Cape Comorin,
the southernmost point of the Indian peninsula,
and his description of it is so accurate, and so
conformable to its real slate, as hews his in-
formation concerning it to have been perfectly
authentic '. Near to this he places the pearl-
fishery of Colchos, the modern Kilkare, un-
doubtedly the fame with that now carried on
by the Dutch in the strait which feparatcs the
island of Ceylon from the continent. As adja-
cent to this he mentions three different ports,
which appear to have been situated on the east
fide of the peninsula now known by the name
of the Ceromandel coast. He describes these

a PcrMp1. 33. D'Anville Art. de I'1ide, iS, 9zc.

as

57

6 E C T. as ernpcria, or stations of trade b; but from an

II. attentive consideration of some circumfiances in

his account of them, I think it probable that
the hips from Berenice did not fail to any of
these ports, though they were supplied, as he
informs us, with the commodities brought from
Egypt, as well as with the produtions of the
opposite coast of the peninsula; but these seem
to have been imported in country hips '. It was
likewise in vessels of their own, varying in form
and burden, and diltinguifhed by different
names, some of which he mentions, that they
traded with the Golden Cherfonefus, or king.
dom of Malacca, and the countries near the
Ganges. Not far from the mouth of that river
he places an island, which he describes as situ-
ated under the rising fun, and as the last region
in the East that was inhabited'. Of all these
parts of India, the Author of theCircumnavigati-
on appears to have had very slender knowledge,as
is manifest, not onlyfrom what he mentions con-
cerning this imaginary ifand, and from his not
attempting to describe them, but from his relat-
ing, with the credulity and love of the mar-
vellous, which always accompany and charac-
terifeignorance, that these remote regions were
peopled with cannibals, and men of uncouth
and monirrous formsc.

I HAVE been induced to bestow this attention,

in tracing the course delineated in the Circum-
navigation of the Erythraean Sea, because the
Author of it is the firif ancient writer to whom
we are indebted for any knowledge of the east-
ern coast of the great peninsula of India, or of
the countries which lie beyond it. To Strabo,

who
58

who composed his great work on geography in S E C T.
the reign of Augustus, India, particularly the I
most eastern parts of it, was little known. He
begins his description of it with requesting the
indulgence of his readers, on account of the
scanty information he could obtain with refpea
to a country to remote, which Europeans had
seldom visited, and many of them transiently
only, in the functions of military service. IHe
observes, that even commerce had contributed
little towards an accurate investigation of the
country, as few of the merchants from Egypt
and the Arabian Gulf had ever failed as far as
the Ganges; and from men so illiterate, intel-
ligence that merited a full degree of confidence
could hardly be expe&ed. His descriptions of
India, particularly its interior provinces, are
borrowed almost entirely from the Memoirs of
Alexander's Officers, with some slender addi-
tions from more recent accounts, and these so
few in number, and sometimes so inaccurate,
as to furnish a striking proof of the small pro-
grefs which the ancients had made., from the
time of Alexander, in exploring that country.
When an author, possessed of such discernment
and industry as Strabo, who visited in person
several distant regions that he might be able to
describe them with greater accuracy, relates,
that the Ganges enters the ocean by one
mouth', we are warranted in concluding, that
in his time there was either no diret navigation
carried on to that great river, by the traders
from the Arabian Gulf, or that this voyage
was undertaken so seldom, that science had not
then derived much information from it.

THE next author, in order of time, from
whom we receive any account of India, is the

Strabo, lib. xv. oll. C.

elder

59

S E C T. elder Pliny, who flourished about fifty years

later than Strabo. As in the hort description
of India given in his Natural History, he fol-
lows the lame guides with Strabo, and seems to
have had no knowledge of the interior country,
but what he derived from the officers who served
under Alexander and his immediate successors,
it is unnecefiary to examine his description mi-
nuelv. He has added, however, two valuable
articles, for which he was indebted to more
recent discoveries. The one is the account of
the new course of navigation from the Arabian
Gulf to the coaf of Malabar, the nature and
importance of which I have already explained.
The other is a description of the island of Ta-
probana, which 1 hall confider particularly, as-
ter enquiring into what Ptolemy has contri-
buted towards our knowledge of the ancient
fta:e of India.

THouGH Ptolemv, who published his works

about fourscore vtars after Pliny, seems to have
been more ditinguithed for his persevering in-
duftry, and talent for arrangement, than for
an inventive genius; geography has been more
indebted to him for its improvement, than to
any other philosopher. Fortunately for that
science, in forming his general lyftem of geo-
graphy, he adopted the ideas, and imitated the
practice of Hipparchus, who lived near four
hundred years before his time. That great phi-
lofopher was the first who attempted to make a
catalogue of the stars. In order to ascertain
their position in the heavens with accuracy, he
measured their diltance from certain circles of
the sphere, computing it by degrees, either from
east to well, or from north to south. The for-
mer was denominated the longitude of the fiar,
the latter its latitude. This mode he found to

be

be of such utility in his atronomical refc'alches, s F C T.
that he applied it with no less happy eitfct to i
geography; and it is a circumtance worthy of ~'
notice, that it was by observing and dcl'ribiiln
the heavens, men were first taught to measure
and delineate the earth with exaCtness. This
method of fixing the position of places, in-
vented by Hipparchus, though known to the geo-
graphers between his time and that of Ptolemy,
and mentioned both by Strabo , and by Pliny ',
was not employed by any of them. Of this
negle& the most probable account seems to be,
that, as none of them were atronomers, they
did not fully comprehend all the advantages
geography might derive from this invention '.
These Ptolemy, who had devoted a long life to
the improvement of atronomy, theoretical as
well as pracical, perfetly dilcerned, and, as
in both these Hipparchus was his guide, he, in
his famous treatise on geography, described the
different parts of the earth according to their
longitude and latitude. Geography was thus
established upon its proper principles, and in-
timately conneEted with astronomical obferva-
tion and mathematical science. This work of
Ptolemy soon rose high in estimation among the
ancients'. During the middle ages, both in
Arabia and in Europe, the deciions of Ptolemy,
in every thing relative to geography, were sub-
mitted to with an assent as implicit, as was
yielded to those f Aristotle in all other depart-
ments of science. On the revival of a more
liberal spirit of inquiry in the sixteenth century,
the merit of Ptolemy's improvements in geo-
graphy was examined and recognized; that
scientific language which he first rendered ge-

neral,

E C T. neral, continues to be used, and the position
JI of places is still ascertained in the fame diftind
t^ ' and compendious manner, by specifying their

longitude and latitude.

NOT satisfied with adopting the general prin-

ciples of Hipparchus, Ptolemy emulated him
in the application of them; and, as that phi-
lofopher bad arranged all the constellations, he
ventured upon what was no less arduous, to fur-
vey all the regions of the earth, which were
then known, and with minute and bold decision
he fixed the longitude and latitude of the most
remarkable places in each of them. All his
determinations, however, are not to be confi-
dered as the result of atual observation, nor
did Ptolemy publish them as such. Aronomi-
cal science was confined, at that time, to a few
countries. A considerable part of the globe
was little visited, and imperfecly described.
The position of a small number of places only
had been fixed with any degree of accuracy.
Ptolemy was therefore obliged to consult the
itineraries and surveys of the Roman Empire,
which the political wisdom of that great Rate
had completed with immense labour and ex-
pence '. Beyond the precints of the empire,
he had nothing on which he could rely, but
the journals and reports of travellers. Upon
these all his conclusions were founded; and as
be resided in Alexandria at a time when the
trade from that city to India was carried on to
its utmost extent, this situation might have been
expeded to afford him the means of procuring
ample information concerning it. But either
from the imperfet manner in which that coun-
try was explored in his time, or from his placing

too

too much confidence in the reports of persons S E C T.
who had visited it with little attention or dif- II
cernment ", his general delineation of the form
of the Indian continent is the most erroneous
that has been transmitted to us from antiquity.
By an astonishing miflake, he has made the pe.
ninfula of India itretch from the Sinus Baryga-
zenus, or Gulf of Cambay, from weft to east,
instead of extending, according to its real di-
reEtion, from north to south ". This error will
appear the more unaccountable, when we re-
collet that Megafthenes had publihed a mea-
furement of the Indian peninsula, which ap-
proaches near to its true dimensions; and that
this had been adopted, with some variations, by
Eratosthenes, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and
Pliny, who wrote prior to the age of Pto-
lemy °.

ALTHOUGH Ptolemy was led to form such

an erroneous opinion concerning the general di-
menfions of the Indian continent, his informa-
tion with refpe& to the country in detail, and
the situation of particular places, was more ac-
curate; and he is the first author possessed of
such knowledge as enabled him to trace the sea-

It is foreign to the object of this Disquisition,
to enter into such a minute detail; but in feve-
ral inltances we may observe, that not only the
conformity of position, but the similarity of an-
cient and modern names, is very firiking. The
great river Cauveri is by Ptolemy named Cha-
beris; Arcot, in the interior country, is Ar-
cati Regia; and probably the whole coast has
received its present name of Coromandel from
Ssr Mlandulam, or the kingdom of Sorze, which
is situated upon it'.

IN the course of one hundred and thirty-fix

years, which elapsed from the death of Strabo
to that of Ptolemy, the commercial intercourse
with India was greatly extended; the latter
geographer had acquired such an accession of
new information concerning the Ganges, that
he mentions the names of fix different mouths
of that river, and describes their positions.
His-delineation, however, of that part of India
which lies beyond the Ganges, is not less erro-
neous in its general form, than that which he
gave of the peninsula, and bears as little re-
semblance to the actual position of those coun-
tries. He ventures, nevertheless, upon a fur-
vey of them, imilar to that which he had made
of the other great division of India, which I
have already examined. He mentions the places
of note along the coast, some of which he dif-

staples of trade to the natives, in their traffic Ac .
carried on from one diftric of India to another,
or whether they were ports, to which veflels
from the Arabian Gulf retorted direcly, is not
specified. The latter I flould think to be the
idea which Ptolemy means to convey; but these
regions of India were so remote, and, from the
timid and flow course of ancient navigation,
were probably so little frequented, that his in-
formation concerning them is extremely defec-
tive, and his descriptions are more obscure, more
inaccurate, and less conformable to the real
state of the country, than in any part of his
geography. That peninsula to which he gives
the name of the Golden Cherfonefus, he deli-
neates as if it stretched direcly from north to
south, and fixes the latitude of Sabana Empo-
rium, its southern extremity, three degrees be-
yond the line. To the east of this peninsula he
places, what he calls the Great Bay, and in
the most remote part of it the flation of Cati-
gara, the utmost boundary of navigation in an-
cient times, to which he afligns no less than
eight degrees and a half of southern latitude.
Beyond this, he declares the earth to be altoge-
ther unknown, and aflerts that the land turns
thence to the westward, and stretches in that di-
retion until it joins the promontory of Praffum
in Ethiopia, which, according to his idea, ter-
minated the continent of Africa to the south .
In consequence of this error, no less unac-
countable than enormous, he muff have believed
the Erythrean Sea, in its whole extent from
the coast of Africa to that of Cambodia, to be

OUT of the confusion of those wild ideas, in

which the accounts of ignorant or fabulous tra-
vellers hve involved the geography of Ptolemy,
M. D'Anville has attempted to bring order;
and, with much ingenuity, he has formed opi-
nions with refpeca to some capital positions,
which have the appearance of being well found-
ed. The peninsula of Malacca is, according to
him, the Golden Cherfonefus of Ptolemy; but
inflead of the direction which he has given it,
we know that it bends some degrees towards the
east. and that Cape de Romania, its southern
extremity, is more than a degree to the north
of the line. The Gulf of Siam he confiders as
the great Bay of Ptolemy, but the position on
the eai of that Bay, corresponding to Catigara,
is actually as many degrees to the north of the
Equator, as he supposed it to be south of
it. Beyond this he mentions an inland city,
to which he gives the name of Thine or Sinae
Metropolis. The longitude which he afigns
to it, is one hundred and eighty degrees from
his first meridian in the Fortunate Island, and
is the utmost point towards the East to which
the ancients had advanced by sea. Its latitude
he calculates to be three degrees south of the
line. If, with M. D'Anville, we conclude the
situation of Sin-hoa, in the western part of the
kingdom of Cochin-China, to be the fame with
Sina Metropolis, Ptolemy has erred in fixing
its position no less than fifty degrees of longi-
tude, and twenty degrees of latitude'.

THESE
65

THESE errors of Ptolemy concerning the re-S E C T.

mote parts of Asia, have been rendered more IL
cqnfpicuous by a mistaken opinion, of modern
times ingrafted upon them. Sine, the molt
distant station mentioned in his geography, has
such a near resemblance in found to China, the
name by which the greatest and molt civilized
empire in the East is known to Europeans, that
upon their first acquaintance with it, they haflily
concluded them to be the fame; and of confe-
quence it was supposed that China was known
to the ancients, though no point feelns to be
more ascertained, than that they never advanced
by sea beyond that boundary which I have al-
lotted to their navigation.

HAVING thus traced the discoveries of India

which the ancients made by lea, 1 shall next ex-
amine what additional knowledge of that coun-
try they acquired from their progress by land.
It appears (as I have formerly related) that there
was a trade carried on early with India througt
the provinces that stretch along the northern
frontier. Its various productions and manu-
factures were transported by land-carriage intg
the interior parts of the Periian dominions, or
were conveyed, by means of the navigable
rivers which flow through the Upper Alia, to
the Caspian Sea and froin that to the Euxine.
While the successors of Seleucus retained the
dominions of the Ealt, this continued to be
the mode of supplying their fubjedts with the
commodities of India. When the Romans had
extended their conquests so far that the Eu-
phrates was the eastern limit of their empire,
they found this trade Ilill established, and as it
opened to them a new communication with the
East, by means of which they received an addi.
tional supply of luxuries, for which they had

F 2 acquired

67

S E C T. acquired the highest relifi, it became an objet

II of their policy to protet and encourage it. As
"' the progress of the caravans or companies of

merchants, which travelled towards the coun-
tries whence they received the most valuable
manufactures, particularly those of silk, was
often interrupted, and rendered dangerous by
the Parthians, who had acquired possession of
all the provinces which extend from the ~as-
pian Sea to that part of Scythia or Tartary
which borders on China, the Romans endea-
voured to render this intercourse more secure
by a negociation with one of the monarchs of
that great empire. Of this fmgular tranfaftion
there is, indeed, no vestige in the Greek or
Roman writers; our knowledge of it is derived
entirely from the Chinese historians, by whom
we are informed that An.toun, (the Emperor
Marcus Antoninus), the king of the people of
th: Western Ocean, ent an embassy with this
view to Oun.ti, who reigned over China in the
hundred and fixty-fixth year of the Christian
wera'. What was the success of this attempt
is not known, nor can we fay whether it fa-
cilitated such an intercourse between these two
remote nations as contributed towards the sup-
ply of their mutual wants. The design certain-
ly was not unworthy of the enlightened empe-
ror of Rome to which it is ascribed.

IT is evident, however, that in prosecuting

this trade with China, a considerable part of
the extensive countries to the east of the Caspian
Sea must have been traversed; and though the
chief inducement to undertake those distant

ers, persons of curiosity and abilities, who '
could turn their attention from commercial ob.
jeas to those of more general concern. From
them such information was procured, and sub-
jeded to scientific discussion, as enabled Ptolemy
to give a description of those inland and remote
regions of Asia , filly as accurate as that of
several countries, of which, from their vicinity,
he may have been supposed to have received
more diftina accounts The farthest point to-
wards the East, to which his knowledge of this
part of Asia extended, is Sera Metropolis,
which, from various circumstances, appears to
have been in the fame situation with Kant-cheou,
a city offome note in Chen-fi, the most welterly
province of the Chinese empire This he places
in the longitude of one hundred and seventy-
seven degrees fifteen minutes, near three degrees
to the weft of Sinae Metropolis, which he had
described as the utmost limit of Asia discovered
by sea. Nor was Ptolemy's knowledge of this
diftrit of Asia confined only to the part of it
through which the caravans may be supposed
to have proceeded direEly in their route east.

ral information concerning various nations to-
wards the north, which, according to the
position that he gives them, occupied parts
of the great plain of Tartary, extending con.
fiderably beyond Lassa, the capital of Thibet,
and the residence of the Dalai Lama.

THE latitudes of several places in this part
of Asia are fixed by Ptolemy with such uncom-

mon precision, that we can hardly doubt of
their having been acertained by atual obfer-
vtion. Out of many inltances of this, I shall
fe!e' three of places situated in very different
parts of ti:e country under review. The lati-
tude of Nagara, on the river C(phenes, (the
modern Attock.) is, according tcPtolemy, thirty-
two degrees and thirty m nutes, which co-in-
cides preciflyv with the obfeivation of an Eastern
geographer quoted by M. D'Anville . The
latitude of Maracanda, or Samarcand, as fixed
by him, is thirty-nine degrees fifteen minutes.
According to the Altronomical Tlables of Ulug
Beg, the grandson of Timur, hose royal re-
fidence ws in that city, it is thirty-nine de-
grees thirty-feven minutes Y. The latitude of
Sera Metrpcls, in Ptolemy, is thirty-eight
degrees fiftcLn minutes; that of Kant-cheou,
as determined by the Jesuit Missionaries, is
thirty-nine dgrees. I have enumerated these
striking examples of the co-incidence of his cal-
culations with there eitflbif.:ed by modern ob-
servations, for two reason- : One, because they
clearly prove that there rmote parts of Asia
had been examined with ome considerable de-
gree of attention; the other, because I feel
great satisfaction, after having been obliged to
mention everal errors and defecs in Ptolemy's
geography, in rendering justice to a philosopher,
who has contributed so much towards the im-
provement of that science. The sacs which
1 have produced afford the itrongeft evidence of
his information, as well as the justness of his
conclusions concerning countries with which,
from their remote situation, we might have
supposed him to be least acquainted.

HITHERTO

HITHERTO I have confined my researches S E C T.

concerning the knowledge which the ancients IIT
had of India, to the continent; I return now
to confider the discoveries which they had
made, of the islands situated in various parts of
the ocean with which it is surrounded, and
begin, as I proposed, with Taprobane, the
greatest and most valuable of them. his island
lay so diretly in the coure of navigators who
ventured beyond Cape Comorin, especially
when, according to the ancient mode of failing,
they seldom ventured far fom the coast, that
its position one should have rhought, muff have
been determined with the utmolt precision.
There is, however, hardly any point in the
geography of the ancients more undecided and
uncertain. Prior to the ae of Alexander the
Great, the name of Taprobane was unknown
in Europe. In consequence of the ative cu-
riofity with which he explored every country
that he subdued or visited, ome information
concerning it seems to have been obtained.
From his time, almost every writer on geogra-
phy has mentioned it, but their accounts of it
are so various, and often lo contradictory, that
we can hardly believe them to be describing
the fame island. Strabo, the arlieft writer
now extant, from whom we have any par!icu-
lar account of it, affirms that it was as large as
Britain, and situated at the distance of seven
days, according to some reports, and accord-
ing to other, of twenty days tailing from the
southern extremity of the Indian peninsula;
from which, contrary to what is known to be
its real position, he describes it as ftretcling
towards the weft above five hundred fadia.

time,

s EC T. time, is uncertain whether he should confider

II. Taprobane as an island, or as the beginning
k'- V' of another world; but as no person, he fays,

had ever failed round it, he seems to incline
towards the latter opinion '. Pliny gives a more
ample description of Taprobane, which, instead
of bringing any accession of light, involves every
thing relating to it in additional obscurity. As-
ter enumerating the various and discordant opi-
nions of the Greek writers, he informs us, that
ambassadors were sent by a king of that illand
to the emperor Claudius, from whom the Ro-
mans learned several things concerning it, which
were formerly unknown; particularly that
there were five hundred towns in the Island,
and that in the centre of it there was a lake
three hundred and feventv-five miles in circum-
ference. These ambassadors were aftoniflied
at the fight of the Great Bear, and the Pleiades,
being conllellations which did not appear in
their fkv; and were still more amazed when
they beheld their hadows point towards the
north, and the fun rile on their left hand, and
set on their right. They affirmed too, that in
their own country the moon was never seen
until the eighth day after the change, and con-
tinued to be visible only to the sixteenth . It
is surprising to find an author so intelligent as
Pliny relating all these circumstances without
animadversion, and particularly that he does
not take notice, that what the ambafladors re-
ported concerning the appearance of the moon,
could not take place in any region of the earth.

PTOLEMY, though so near to the age of Pliny,

seems to have been altogether unacquainted
with his description of Taprobane, or with the

embassy to the emperor Claudius. He places S E CT.
that island opposite to Cape Comorin, at no II.
great distance from the continent, and delineates "'-
it as itretching from north to south, no less
than fifteen degrees, two of which he supposes
to be south of the Equator; and if his repre-
fenration of its dimensions had been just, it
was well intitled from its magnitude to be com-
pared with Britain '. Agathemerus, who wrote
after Ptolemy, and was well acquainted with
his geography, confiders Taprobane as the
largest of all islands, and assigns to Britain only
the second place".

FROM this diversity of the descriptions given

by ancient writers, it is not lurprifing that the
moderns hould have entertained very different
sentiments with respect to the island in the In-
dian ocean which was to be confidered as the
fame with the Taprobane of the Greeks and
Romans. As both Pliny and Ptolemy describe
it as lying in part to the south of the Equator,
some learned men maintain Sumatra to be the
island which corresponds to this description.
But the great distance of Sumatra from the
peninsula of India does not accord with any ac-
count which the Greek or Roman writers have
given of the situation of Taprobane, and we
have no evidence that the navigation of the
ancients ever extended so far as Sumatra. The
opinion more generally received is, that the
Taprobane of the ancients is the island of
Ceylon; and not only its vicinity to the con-
tinent of India, but the general form of
the island, as delineated by Ptolemy, as well
as the position of several places in it, mentioned

11I some extraordinary miltakes, of which I hall

certainty.

THE other islands to the east of Taprobane,

mentioned by Ptolemy, might be ihewn (if such
a detail were necessary) to be the Andaman
and Nicobar Islands in the Gulf of Bengal.

AFTER this long, and, I am afraid, tedious

investigation of the progress made by the an-
cients, in exploring the different parts of India,
and after tracing them as far as they advanced
towards the East, either by sea or land, I hall
offer some general remarks concerning the
mode in which their discoveries were conducted,
and the degree of confidence with which we
may rely on the accounts of them, which could
not have been offered with the fame advantage
until this investigation was finiihed.

THE art of delineating maps, exhibiting ei-

ther the figure of the whole earth, as far as it
had been explored, or that of particular coun-
tries, was known to the a;cients; and without
the use of them to assist the imagination, it
was impoflible to have formed a diftint idea
either of the one or of the other. Some of
there maps are mentioned by Herodotus, and
other early Greek writers. But no maps prior
to those which were formed in order to illustrate
the geography of Ptolemy, have reached our
times, in consequence of which it is very dif-
ficult to conceive what was the relative fitua-
tion of the different places mentioned by the
ancient geographers, unless when it is precisely
ascertained by measurement '. As soon, how-

ever,

ever, as the mode of marking the situation of S E C T.
eath place by specifying its longitude and lati. .
tude was introduced, and came to be generally
adopted, every position could be described in
compendious and scientific terms. But fill
the accuracy of this new method, and the im-
provement which geography derived from it,
depends upon the mode in which the ancients
estimated the latitude and longitude of places.

THOUGH the ancients proceeded in deter-

mining the latitude and longitude of places
upon the fame principles with the moderns, yet
it was by means of instruments very inferior in
their contrudion to those now used, and with-
out the fame minute attention to every circum-
itance that may affect the accuracy of an ob-
servation, an attention of which long experience
only can demonstrate the necessity. In order to
ascertain the latitude of any place, the ancients
observed the meridian altitude of the fun, either
by means of the hadow of a perpendicular
gnomon, or by means of an astrolabe, from
which it was easy to compute how many de-
grees and minutes the place of observation was
distant from the Equator. When neither of
these methods could be employed, they inferred
the latitude of any place from the belt accounts
which they could procure of the length of its
longest day.

W ITH refped to determining the longitude

of any place, they were much more at a loss,
as there were only one set of celestial phenome-
na to which they could have recourse. hefe
were the eclipses of the moon (for those of the
fun were not so well understood as to be sub-
servient to the purposes of geography): the
difference between the time at which an eclipse

was

75

S E C T. was observed to begin or to end at two different

iI- places, gave immediately the difference between
\LV3' the meridians of those places. But the difficul-

ty of making those observations with accuracy,
and the i:npoffibility of repeating them often,
rendered them of so little use in geography,
that the ancients in determining longitudes
were obliged, for the most part, to have re-
course to actual furvevs, or to the vague infor-
mation which was to be obtained from the
reckonings of sailors, or the itineraries of
travellers.

BUT though the ancients, by means of the

operations which I have mentioned, could de-
termine the pofitionof places with a confider-
able degree of accuracy at land, it is very un-
certain whether or not they had any proper
mode of determining this at sea. The navigators
of antiquity seem rarely to have had recourse to
astronomical observation. They had no in-
ftruments suited to a moveable and unsteady
observatory; and though by their practice of
landing frequently, they might, in some mea-
sure, have supplied that defect, yet no ancient
author, as far as I know, has given an account
of any atronomical observation made by them
during the course of their voyages. It seems
to be evident from Ptolemy, who employs some
chapters in hewing how geography may be im-
proved, and its errors may be rectified, from
the reports of navigators , that their calcula-
tions A ere founded solely upon reckoning, and
were not the result of observation. Even after
all the improvements which the moderns have
made in the science of navigation, this mode
of computing by reckoning is known to be so

f Lb. i. c. -14.

1oose

loose and uncertain, that, from it alone, no s E C T.
conclusion can be deduced with any degree of
precision. Among the ancients, this inaccuracy
must have been greatly augmented, as they
were accutomed in their voyages, instead of
steering a direct course which might have been
more easily measured, to a circuitous navigation
along the coast; and were unacquainted with
the compass, or any other instrument by whith
its bearings might have been ascertained. We
find, accordingly, the position of many places
which we may suppose to have been determined
at sea, fixed with little exadnefs. When, in
consequence of an ative trade, the ports of
any country were much frequented, the reckon-
ings of different navigators may have served
in some measure to correct each other, and
may have enabled geographers to form their
conclusions with a nearer approximation to
truth. But in remote countries, which have
neither been the feat of military operations, nor
explored by caravans travelling frequently
through them, every thing is more vague and
undefined, and the resemblance between the
ancient descriptions of them, and their acual
figure, is often so faint that it can hardly be
traced. The latitude of places too, as might
be expe&ed, was in general much more accu-
rately known by the ancients than their longi-
tude. The observations by which the former
was determined are simple, made with ease,
and are not liable to much error. The other
cannot be ascertained precisely, without more
complex operations, and the use of infiruments
much more perfec than any that the ancients
seem to have possessed'. Among the vast num-

S E C T. ber of place;, the position of which is fixed by

II Ptolemy, I know not if he approaches 'as near

to truth in the longitude of any one, as he has
done in fixing the latitu e of the three cities
which I formerly mentioned as a striking,
though not singular, instance of his exac-
ness.

THESE observations induce me to adhere to

an opinion, which I proposed in another place ',
that the Greeks and Romans, in their commer-
cial intercourse with Inlia, were seldom led,
either by curiosity or the love of gain, to visit
the most eastern parts of it. A variety of par-
ticulars occur to confirm this opinion. Though
Ptolemy beflows the appellation of Emporia on
several places fituatel on the coast, which
stretches from the ealtern mouth of the Ganges
to the extremity of the Golden Cherfonefus, it
is uncertain, as I frmerly observed, whether
from his having given them this name, we are
to confider them as harbours frequented by hips
from Egypt, or merely by vessels of the cotq-
try. Beyond the Golden Cherfonefus, it is re-
markable that he mentions one Emporium only',
which plainly indicates the intercourse with this
region of India to have been very inconfide-
rable. Had voyages from the Arabian Gulf
to those countries of India been as frequent,
as to have intitled Ptolemy to specify so minutely
the longitude and latitude of the great number
of places which he mentions, he must, in con-
sequence of this, have acquired such informa-
tion as would have prevented several great er-
rors into which he has fallen. Had it been
usual to double Cape Comorin, and to fail up
the Bay of Bengal to the mouth of the Ganges,

some

some of the ancient geographers would not SE C T.
have been so uncertain, and others so widely IT
mistaken, with refpeE to the situation and mag-
nitude of the island of Ceylon. If the mer-
chants of Alexandria had often visited the ports
of the Golden Cherfonefus, and of the Great
Bay, Ptolemy's descriptions of them mult have
been rendered more correspondent to their real
form, nor could he have believed several places
to lie beyond the line, which are in truth some
degrees on this fide of it.

BUT though the navigation of the ancients

may not have extended to the farther India, we
are certain that various commodities of that
country were imported into Egypt, and thence
were conveyed to Rome, and to other parts
of the empire. From circumstances which I
have already enumerated, we are warranted in
concluding, that these were brought in vessels
of the country to Mufiris, and to the other
ports on the Malabar coast, which were, at that
period, the flaples of trade with Egypt. In a
country of such extent as India, where the na-
tural produtions are various, and greatly di-
verfified by art and industry, an active domes-
tic commerce, both by sea and by land, must
have early taken place among its different pro-
vinces. Of this we have some hints in ancient
authors; and where the sources of information
are so few and so scanty, we must reft satisfied
with hints. Anong the different classes, or
casts, into which the people of India were di-
vided, merchants are mentioned as one ", from
which we mufl conclude trade to have been one
of the eablif0ed occupations of men in that
country. From the Author of the Circumna-

k Plin. Nat. Hiif. lib. vi. c. 22.

S E C T. vigation of the Erythraean Sea, we learn that

1I the inhabitants of the Coromandel coast traded

in vessels of their own with those of Malabar;
that the interior trade of Barygaza was confi-
derable; and that there was, at all seasons, a
number of country hips to be found in the
harbour of Mufiris'. By Strabo we are in-
formed, that the most valuable productions of
Taprobane were carried to different Emporia of
India . In this way the traders from Egypt
might be supplied with them, and thus could
finish their voyages within the year, which must
have been protrated much longer if they had
extended as far towards the east as is generally
supposed.

FROM all this it appears to be probable, that

Ptolemy derived the information concerning
the eastern parts of India, upon which he founds
his calculations, not so much from any diret
or regular intercourse between Egypt and these
countries, as from the reports of a few adven-
turers, whom an enterprising spirit, or the love
of gain, prompted to proceed beyond the usual
limits of navigation.

THOUGH, from the age of Ptolemy, the trade

with India continued to be carried on in its
former channel, and both Rome, the ancient
capital of the empire, and Constantinople, the
new feat of government, were supplied with
the precious commodities of that country by the
merchants of Alexandria, yet, until the reign
of the Emperor Jultinian, we have no new in-
formation concerning the intercourse with the
East by sea, or the progress which was made
in the discovery of its remote regions. Under

nounced all the concerns of this life, and as-
fumed the monastic character. In the solitude
and leisure of a cell, he composed several works,
one of which, dignified by him with the name
of Chrilian Topography, has reached us. The
main design of it is to combat the opinion of
those philosophers, who assert the earth to be of
a spherical figure, and to prove that it is an ob-
long plane, of twelve thousand miles in length
from east to weft, and of fix thousand miles in
breadth from north to south, surrounded by
high walls, covered by the firmament as with
a canopy or vault; that the vifficitude of day
and night was occasioned by a mountain of
prodigious height, situated in the extremities
of the north, round which the fun moved;
that when it appeared on one fide of this moun-
tain, the earth was illuminated, when con-
cealed on the other fide, the earth was left in-
volved in darkness . But amidit those wild
reveries, more suited to the credulity of his new
profeflion, than to the found sense charaderiftic
of that in which he was formerly engaged, Cos-
mas seems to relate what he himself had ob.
served in his travels, or what he had learned
from others, with great simplicity and regard
for truth.

HE appears to have been well acquainted with

the weft coast of the Indian peninsula, and
names several places situated upon it; he de-

I. and mentions Male, in particular, as one of the

moll frequented ports on that account °. From
Male, it is probable that this fide of the con-
tinent has derived its modem name of Malabar;
and the cluster of islands contiguous to it, that
of the Maldives. From him too we learn, that
the island of Taprobane, which he fuppoles to
lie at an equal diitance from the Persian Gulf on
the weft, and the country of the Sine on the
eat, had become, in consequence of this com-
modiois situation, a great staple of trade; that
into i were imported the silk of the Sinae, and
the precious pice of the Eastern countries,
wL-ich were conveved thence to all parts of In-
,ia, to Prfla. and to the Arabian Gulf. To this
iTand he gives the name of Sielediba , the fame
with that of Selendib, or Serendib, b) which it
is well known all over the Eafl.

To Cofinas we are also indebted for the firfl

i.i:)rmation of a new rival to the Roinans in
trade having appeared in the Indian ieas. The
Persians, after haxing overturned the empire

pire. As the voyage from Persia to India was S E C T.
much florter than that from Egypt, and at- IIl
tended with less expence and danger, the in- \Y
tercourfe between the two countries increased
rapidly. Acircumftance is mentioned by Cos-
mas which is a striking proof of this. In most
of the cities of any note in India he found
Christian churches established, in which the
functions of religion were performed by priests
ordained by the Archbishop of Seleucia, the ca-
pkal of the Persian empire, and who continued
subjea to his jurifdition q. India appears to
have been more thoroughly explored at this pe-
riod, than it was in the age of Ptolemy, and a
greater number of firangers seem to have been
fettled there. It is remarkable, however, that,
according to the account of Cofias, none of
these strangers were accuflomed to visit the east-
ern regions of Asia, but refted satisfied with
receiving their silk, their spices, and other va-
luable productions, as they were imported into
Ceylon, and conveyed thence to the various
marts of India'.

TIIE frequency of open hostilities between the

emperors of Conltantinople and the monarchs
of Persia, together with the increasing rivalfhip
of their ifbjeds in the trade with India, gave
rife to an event which produced a considerable
change in the nature of that commerce. As
the uie of silk, both in dress and furniture, be-
came gradually more general in the court of the
Greek emperors, who imitated and surpassed
the sovereigns of Asia in splendour and mag.
nificence; and as China, in which, according
to the concurring testimony of Oriental writers,
the culture of silk was originally known ', still

II. dauctd that valuable commodity; the Persians,

improving the advantages which their situation
gave them over the merchants from the Arabian
Gulf, supplanted them in all the marts of India
to which silk was brought by sea from the East.
Having it likewise in their power to molest
or cut off the caravans, which, in order to
procure a supply for the Greek empire, travelled
by land to China, through the northern pro-
vinces of their kingdom, they entirely engrossed
that branch of commerce. Constantinople was
obliged to depend on a rival power for an ar-
ticle which luxury viewed and desired as effen-
til to elzance. The Persians, with the ufial
rapacity of monopolieis, raised the price of silk
to such an exorbitant height', that Justinian,
eager not only to obtain a full and certain sup-
ply of the commodity which was become of in-
dispensable use, but solicitous to deliver the
commerce of his fubjeds from the exacions
of his enemies, endeavoured, by means of his
ally, the Christian monarch of Abyssinia, to
wrest ome portion of the silk trade from the
Persians. In this attempt he failed; but when
A.D.j,. he least expected it, he, by an unforeseen e-

vent, attained, in fonme measure, the objec
which he had in view. Two Persian monks
having been employed as miionaries in lome
of the Christian churches, which were efta-
biifhed as we are informed by Cofmas) in dif.
ferent parts of India, had penetrated into the
country of the Seres, OF China. There thev
observed the labours of the silk-worm, and be-
came acquainted with all the arts of man in
warking up its productions into such a variety
of elegant fabrics. The profped of gain, ox

perhaps an indignant zeal, excited by feeing S E CT.
this lucrative branch of commerce engrossed 1I
by unbelieving nations, prompted them to re-
pair to Con!tantinople. There they explained
to the emperor the origin of silk, as well as the
various modes of preparing and manufactur-
ing it, mysteries hitherto unknown, or very im.
perfeEtly underflood in Europe; and encou-
raged by his liberal promises, they under.
took to bring to the capital a sufficient num-
ber of those wonderful infects, to whose la.
bours man is so much indebted. This they
accornplifhed by conveying the eggs of the
silk-worm in a hollow cane. Theywere hatched
by the heat of a dunghill. fed with the leaves
of a wild mulberry tree, and they multiplied
and worked in the fame manner as in those
climates where they first became objets of hu.
man attention and care". Valt numbers of
these infects were soon reared in different parts
of Greece, particularly in the Peloponnefus.
Sicily afterwards undertook to breed silk-worms
with equal success, and was imitated, from time
to time, in several towns of Italy. In all these
places extensive manufactures were eftablihed,
and carried on, with silk of domestic produc.
tion. The demand of silk from the East di-
minifhed of ourfe, the fubjets of the Greek
emperors were no longer obliged to have re-,
course to the Persians for a supply of it, and a
considerable change took place in the nature
of the commercial intercourse between Europe
and India ,

Ill. Jutfinian, an event hppened, which oc-

the intercourse of Europe with the East. Ma-
homet, by publishing a new religion, seems to
have animated his countrymen with a new
spirit, and to have called forth latent paflions
and talents into exertion. The greatest part of
the Arabs, satisfied from the earliest times with
national independence and personal liberty,
tended their camels, or reared their palm-trees:

and had little intercourse with the reit of man-
kind, unless when they allied out to plunder a
caravan, or to rob a traveller. In tome dif-
tricts, however, they had begun to add the la-
bours of agriculture, and the business of com-
merce, to the occupations of pastoral life. All
these orders of men, when prompted by the en-
thufiaflic ardourwith which the exhortations and
example of Mahomet inspired them, displayed,
at once, all the zeal of missionaries, and the
ambition of conquerors. 'They spread the doe-
trine of their prophet, and extended the domi-
nion of his fucceflbrs, from the shores of the
Atlantic to the frontier of China, with a ra-
pidity of success to which there is nothing fimi-
lar in the history of mankind. Egypt was one A.D.64o.
of their earliest conquests; and as they fettled
in that inviting country, and kept pofflflion of
it, the Greeks were excluded from all inter-
course with Alexandria, to which they had
long resorted as the chief mart of Indian goods.
Nor was this the only effed which the progrels
of the Mahomedan arms had upon the corm.
merce of Europe with India. Prior to their
invasion of Egypt, the Arabians had subdued
the great kingdom of Persia, and added it to
the empire of the Caliphs. They found their
new fubjets engaged in prosecuting that exten,
five trade with India, and the country to the
east of it, the commencement and progress of
'xhich in Persia 1 have already mentioned; and
they were so sensible of the great advantages
derived from it, that they became desirous to
partake of them. As the active powers of
the human mind, when routed to vigorous
exertions in one line, are mofl capable of opera.
ting with force in other directions; the Ara-
bians, from impetuous warriors, soon became

enterprising

87

S E C T. enterprising merchants. They continued to

lIl. carry on the trade with India in its former

channel from the Persian Gulf, but it was with
that ardour which characterizes all the early
efforts of Mahomet's followers. In a tort time
they advanced far beyond the boundaries of an.
cient navigation, and brought many of the
moll precious commodities of the East direcly
from the countries which produced them. In
order to engross all the profit arising from the
sale of them, the Caliph Omar ', a few years
after the conquest of Persia, founded the city
of Baffora, on the western banks of the great
stream formed by the junction of the Euphrates
and Tigris, with a view of securing the com-
mand of these two rivers, by which goods im-
ported from India were conveyed into all parts
of Asia. With such discernment was the fitua.
tion chosen, that Baffora soon became a place
of trade hardly inferior to Alexandria.

THIS general information with refpe to

the trade of the Arabians with India, which is
all that can be derived from the historians of
that period, is confirmed and illustrated by the
Relation of a Voyage from the Persian Gulf
towards the East, written by an Arabian mer-
chant in the year of the Chriflian asra eight
hundred and fifty-one, about two centuries
after Persia was subjet to the Caliphs, and ex-
plained by the Commentary of another Arabian,
who had likewise visited the Eastern parts of
Asia'. This curious Relation, which enables
us to fill up a chasm in the history of mercan.
tile communication with India, furnihes ma.
terials for describing more in detail the extent

of the Arabian discoveries in the East, and the S E c r
manner in which they made them. 1!

THOUGH some have imagined that the won-

derful property of the magnet, by whic ;t
communicates such virtue to a needle or fler.'or
rod of iron, as to make it point towards t;,,:
poles of the earth, was known in the East long
before it was observed in Europe, it is mani-
fest, both from the Relation of the Mahome-
tan merchant, and from much concurring evi-
dence, that not only the Arabians. but the
Chinese, were destitute of this faithful guide,
and that their mode of navigation was not more
adventrous than that of the Greeks and Romans'.
They fleered servilely along the coast, seldom
firetching out to sea io far as to lose fight of
land, and as they haped their oourfe in this
timid manner, their mode of reckoning was
defetive, and liable to the fame errors which
I observed in that of the Greeks and Romans'.

NOTWITHSTANDING these disadvantages, the

progress of the Arabians towards the East ex-
tended far beyond the Gulf of Siam, the boun-
dary of European navigation. They became
acquainted with Sumatra, and the other islands
of the great Indian Archipelago, and advanced
as far as the city of Canton in China. Nor
are these discoveries to be confidered as the
effeet of the enterprising curiosity of individuals;
they were owing to a regular commerce carried
on from the Persian Gulf with China, and all
the intermediate countries. Many Mabome-
dans, imitating the example of the Persians de-
fcribed byCofmas Indicopleuftes, fettled in India

sECT. and the countries beyond it. They were so

II.l numerous in the city of Canton, that the em.
"- ~' peror (as the Arabian authors relate) permitted

them to have a Cadi or judge of their own
sect, who decided controversies among his
countrymen by their own laws, and presided
in all the functions of religion '. In other
places proselytes were gained to the Mahome-
dan faith, and the Arabian language was under-
flood and spoken in almost every sea-port of
any note. Ships from China and different
places of India traded in the Persian Gulf', and
by the frequency of mutual intercourse, all the
nations of the East became better acquainted
with each other F.

A STRIKING proof of this is the new infor-

mation concerning China and India we receive
from the two authors I have mentioned. They
point out the situation of Canton, now so well
known to Europeans, with a considerable de-
gree of exacnefs. They take notice of the ge-
neral use of silk among the Chinese. They are
the first who mention their celebrated manu-
facure of porcelane, hich, an account of its
delicacy and transparency, they compare to
glass. They describe the tea-tree, and the
mode of using its leaves; and from the great
revenue which was levied (as they inform us)
from the consumption of it, tea seems to have
been as universally the favourite beverage of
the Chinese in the ninth century, as it is at
present.

EVEN with refpe& to those parts of India S EC T.

which the Greeks and Romans were accustomed I1L
to visit, the Arabians had acquired more perfect '-v -
information. They mention a great empire
established on the Malabar coast, governed by
monarchs whose authority was paramount to
that of every power in India. These monarchs
were distinguished by the appellation of Balcha-
ra, a name yet known in India', and it is
probable that the Samorin, or emperor of
Calicut, so frequently mentioned in the ac-
counts of the first voyages of the Portuguese to
India, possessed some portion of their dominions.
They celebrate the extraordinary progress which
the Indians made in astronomical knowledge, a
circumtance which seems to have been unknown
to the Greeks and Romans, and assert that in
this branch of science they were far superior to
the most enlightened nations of the East, on
which account their sovereign was denominated
the King of Wisdom k. Other peculiarities in
the political institutions, the mode of judicial
proceedings, the pastimes, and the fuperfitions
of the Indians, particularly the excruciating
mortifications and. penances of the faquirs,
might be produced as proofs of the superior
knowledge which the Arabians had acquired
of the manners of that people.

THe fame commercial spirit, or religious

zeal, which prompted theMahomedans ofPerfia
to visit the remotest regions of the East, anima-
ted the Christians of that kingdom. The Nef-
torian churches planted in Persia, under the
protecion first of its native sovereigns, and
afterwards of its conquerors the Caliphs, were

III. fiaftics. They had early sent miflionaries into
'v'India, and established churches in different

parts of it, particularly, as I have formerly
related, in the Island of Ceylon. When the
Arabians extended their navigation as far as
China, a more ample field, both for their corn.
merce and their zeal, opened to their view.
If we may rely on the concurring evidence of
Chriffian authors, in the East as well as in the
Weff, confirmed by the testimony of the two
Mahomedan travellers, their pious labours were
attended with such success, that in the ninth
and tenth centuries the number of Christians in
India and China was very considerable'. As.
the churches in both these countries received
all their ecclesiastics from Persia, where they
were ordained by the Catbolicos, or Neftorian
Primate, whose supremacy they acknowledged,
this became a regular channel of intercourse
and intelligence; and to the combined effet
of all there circumstances, we are indebted for
the information we receive from the two Ara-
bian writers %, concerning those regions of Asia
which the Greeks and Romans never visited.

BUT while both the Mahomedan and Chris.

tian fubjeEts of the Caliphs continued to extend
their knowledge of the East, the people of
Europe found themselves excluded almost en-
tirely from any intercourse with it. To them
the great port of Alexandria was now shut,
and the new lords of the Persian Gulf, satisfied
with upplying the demand in their own vast
dominions for the commodities of the East, ne-
glected to convey them, by any of the usual
channels, to the trading towns on the Medi.

ftantinople, and the other great cities of Europe, III.
bore this deprivation of luxuries, to which they ---'
had been long accustomed, with such impa-
tience, that all the aivty of commerce was
exerted, in order to find a remedy for an evil
which they deemed intolerable. The difficul-
ties which were to be surmounted in order to
accomplish this, afford the most striking proof
of the high eltimation in which the commodi-
ties of the Ealt were held at that time. he
silk of China was purchased in Chenfi, the
westernmost province of that empire, and con-
veyed thence by a caravan, in a march of
eighty or a hundred days, to the banks of the
Oxus, where it was embarked, and carried
down the {tream of that river to the Caspian.
After a dangerous voyage across that sea, and
ascending the river Cyrus as far as it is naviga-
ble, it was conduced by a ihort land-carriage
of five days to the river Phafis ", which falls
into the Euxine or Black Sea. Thence, by an
easy and well known course, it was transported
to Constantinople. The conveyance of commo-
dities from that region of the East, now known
by the name of Indoftan, was somewhat tedious
and operose. They were carried from the
banks of the Indus, by a route early frequent-
ed, and which I have already described, either
to the river Oxus, or directly to the Caspian,
from which they held the fame course to Con-
ftantinople.

I r is obvious, that only commodities of

small bulk and of considerable value, could
bear the expence of such a mode of conveyance;
and in regulating the price of those commodi-

S E C T. ties, not only the expence, but the rifque and

into account. In their journey across the vast
plain extending from Samarcande to the fron-
tier of China, caravans were exposed to the as-
faults and depredations of the Tartars, the
Huns, the Turks, and other roving tribes
which infest the north-east of Afla, and which
have always confidered the merchant and tra-
veller as their lawful prey; nor were they ex-
e:npt from insult and pillage in their journey
from the Cyrus to the Phafis, through the
kingdom of Colchis, a country noted, both in
ancient and in modern times, for the thievilh
dfposition of its inhabitants. Even under all
thee disadvantages, the trade with the East
'. S3 carried on with ardour. Conitantinople
became a considerable mart of Indian and Chi-
ncSe commodities, and the wealth which flowed
into it in consequence of this, not only added
to the splendour of that great city, but eems to
have retarded, for some time, the decline of
the empire of which it was the capital

As far as we may venture to conjecture, from

the i::Lperfed information of cotemporary his-
torians, it was chiefly by the mode of convey.
auce which I have described, perilous and
cperofe as it was, that Europe was upplied with

S E C T. the greatest care, and the tore of historical

Il- materials seem to be abundantly ample, so little

attention- has been paid to the operations of
commerce, that every attempt towards a regu-
lar deduction of them, has been found an un-
dertaking of the utmost .difficulty. The ra,
ho.e er, to which I have conducted this Dif-
quifition, is one of the periods in the annals of
mankind, concerning which history furnishes
mot ficanty information. As it was chiefly in
the Greek emire, and in some cities of Italy,
that any efforts were made to procure the com-
mo.liries of India, and the other regions of
th Eai, it is only from the Historians of those
co-ntries we can expect to find any account of
that trade. But from the age of Mahomet,
until the time when the Comneni ascended the
throne of Constantinople, a period of more
than two centuries and a half, the Byzantine
history is contained in meagre chronicles, the
compilers of which seldom extended their views
beyond the intrigues in the place, the factions
in the theatre, or the disputes of the theolo-
ians. To them the monkish annalilts of the
ifferent states and cities of Italy, during the
fame period, are (if possible) far inferior in
merit, and in the early accounts of those cities
which have been most celebrated for their com-
mercial spirit, we search with little success for
the origin or nature of that trade by which
they firt rose to eminenceP. It is manifest,
however. from the flightell attention to the
events which happened in the seventh and eighth
centuries, that the Italian itates, while their

dence and security in Egypt and Syria. With i*_
what implacable hatred Chriltians viewed Ma-
looledans, as the disciples of an impoltor, is
well known; and as all the nations which pro-
sessed the Christian faith, both in the iaft and
Welt, had mingled the worship of angels and
faints with that of the Supreme Being, and had
adorned their churches with pictures and ita.
tues; the true Moslems confidered themselves
as the only afertors of the unity of God, and
beheld Christians of every denomination with
abhorrence, as idolaters. Much time was re-
quifite to soften this mutual animosity, so far
as to render intercourse in any degree cor-
dial.

MEANWHILE a talte for the luxuries of the

Ealt continued to spread in Italy, but, from
imitation of the Italians, or from some improve-
ment in their own situation, the people of Mar-
feilles, and other towns of France on the Me-
diterranean, became equally fond of them.
But the profits exacted by the merchants of
Amalphi or Venicc, from whom they received
those precious commodities, were so exorbitant
as prompted them to make some effort to sup-
ply their own demands. Vith this view, they
not only opened a trade with Conllantinople,
hut ventured at times to visit the ports of Egypt
and Syria . This eagerness of the Europeans,
on the one hand, to obtain the produCtions of
India, and, on the other hanud, the immense
advantages which both the Caliphs and their
subjects derived from the sale of them, induced
both so far to conceal their reciprocal antipathy,
as to carry on a traffic manifeltly for their com-

III and in what mode it was conduced by these new
1~' adventurers, the scanty information which can

be gathered from contemporary writers, does
not enable me to trace with accuracy. It is
probable, hever, that this communication
would have produced infe .sibly its usual effect,
of fa'niliirizing and reconciling men of hostile
principles and discordant manners to one ano-
ther, and a regular commerce might have been
established graduaLv between Chrifians and
M\ahomedans, upon 'ich equal terms, that the
nations of Europe miniht have received all the
luxuries of the als, by the fame channels in
which they were formerly conveyed to them,
first b the Trians, then by the Greeks of
Alexandria, next v the Romans, and at lalt
by the fubjecs of the Conftantinopolitan em-
pire.

BUT whatever might have been the influence

of this growing correspondence, it was pre-
vented from operating with full effec by the
crusades, or expeditions for the recovery of the
Holy Land, which, during two centuries, oc-
cupied the professors of the two rival religions,
and contributed to alienate them more than
ever from each other. I have, in another work',
contemplated mankind while under the domi-
nion of this frenzy, the molt singular, per-
haps, and the longest continued, of any that
occurs in the history of our species; and I
pointed out such efftc's of it upon government,
upon property, upon manners and taste, as
were suited to what were then the objets of
my enquiry. At present my attention is con-
fined to observe the commercial consequences

of the crufaides, and how far they contributed S E C T.
to retard, or to promote, thl conveyance of In- Il.
dian commodities into Europe.

To fix an idea of the peculiar fancity to that

country, which the Author of our Religion fe-
lected as the place of his residence while on
earth, and in which he accomplished the re-
demption of mankind, is a sentiment so natural
to the human mind, that, from the first efta-
blifhment of Chriitianity, the visiting of the
holy places in Judea was confidered as an ex-
ercife of piety, tending powerfully to awaken
and to cherish a spirit of devotion. Through
succeeding ages, the pratice continued, and
increased in every part of Christendom.-
When Jerufalen was fubjeded to the Maho-
medan empire, and danger was added to the
fatigue and expence of a distant pilgrimage,
the undertaking was viewed as still more me-
ritorious. It was fometiimcs enjoined as a pe-
nance to be performed by heinous transgressors.
It was more frequently a duty undertaken with
voluntary zeal, and in both cafes it was deemed
an expiation for ail palt offences. From va-
rious causes, which I have elsewhere enume-
rated', these pious visits to the Holy Land mul-
tiplied amazingly during the tenth and eleventh
centuries. Not only individuals in the lower
and middle ranks of life, but persons of fu-
pcrior condition, attended by large retinues,
and numerous caravans of opulent pilgrims, re-
forted to Jerusalem.

IN all their operations, however, men have

a wonderful dexterity in mingling some attention
to interelt with thole funcions which seem to

S E C T. be most purely spiritual. The Mahomedan ca-

I. ravans which, in obedience to the injunAions
"'~' of their religion, visit the holy temple of Mec-

ca, are not composed, as I {hall hereafter ex-
plain more fully, of devout pilgrims only, but
of merchants, who, both in going and return-
ing, are provided with such an assortment of
goods, that they carry on a confid.rable traffic '
Even the Faquirs of Inia, whole wild enthu-
fiafr. seems to elevate them above all solicitude
about the concerns of this world, have ren-
dered their frequent pilgrimagcs lubfervient to
their interest, by trading in every country
through which they travel . In like manner,
it was not by dvotion alone that such numer-
ous bands oi Christian pilgrims were induced
to visit Jerufclem. To many of them com-
merce was the chief motive of undertaking
that distant voyage, and by exchanging the
productions of Europe for the more valuable
commodities of Asia, particularly those of In-
dia, which at that time were diffused through
every part of the Caliphs dominions, they en-
riched themfeives, and furnished their coun-
trymen with such an additional supply of East-
ern luxuries, as augmented their relish for
them '.

BUT how faint soever the lines may be, which,

prior to the crusades, mark the influence of
the frequent pilgrimages to the East upon com-
merce, they become so conspicuous after the
commencement of these expeditions, as to
meet the eye of every observer. Various cir-
cumitances concurred towards this, from an
enumeration of which it will appear, that by

attending

attending to the progress and effects of the cru- S E C T.
fades, considerable light is thrown upon the '
subject of my inquiries. Great armies, con-
ducted by the most illuftious nobles of Europe,
and composed of men of the most enterprising
spirit in all the kingdoms of it, marched to-
wards Palestine, through countries far advanced
beyond those which they left, in every species
of improvement. They beheld the dawn of
prosperity in the republics of Italy, which had
begun to vie with each other in the arts of
industry, and in their efforts to engross the
lucrative commerce with the East. They next
admired the more advanced ate of opulence
and splendour in Constantinople, railed to a
pre-eminence above all the cities then known,
by its extensive trade, particularly that which
it carried on with India, and the countries be-
yond it. They afterwards served in these pro-
vinces of Asia through which the commodities
of the East were usually conveyed, and became
masters of several cities which had been staples
of that trade. They established the kingdom
of Jerusalem, which fubfifled near two hun-
dred years. They took poffeflion of the throne
of the Greek empire, and governed it above
half a century. Amidst such a variety of events
and operations, the idea of the fierce warriors
of Europe gradually opened and improved;
they became acquainted with the policy and
arts of the people whom they fbdued; they
observed the sources of their wealth, and availed
themselves of all this knowledge. Antioch and
Tyre, when conquered by the crusades, were
flourishing cities, inhabited by opulent mer-
chants, who supplied all te nations trading
in the Mediterranean with the productions of

the

S E C T. the Ea , and as far as can be gathered from in-

1!. cidental occurrenIce, mentioned by the Hifto-

rians of the Holy ar, who, bin: mostly
priests and monks, had their attention directed
to objects very dirtcrent fiom those relating to
commerce, there is raion to belicve that both
in Contantinople, -vhilc subject to the Franks,
and in the ports ot Svria acquircd by the Chris-
tians, the lc;.:-- bi:hcd trade with the East
continu.d to bt pro:ee:;d and icncouraged.

BUT though conmmilce inav have been only

a secondary object with the martial leaders of
the crusades, engagecd in perpetual holtilities
vith the lurks o one hand, and with the Sol-
dans of Eypt on ti.e oth-r, it was the primary
object with the aibtciates, in conjunction with
vhom they carried on their operations. Nu-
merous as the amics were which alfumed the
cross, and enterprizing as the fanatical zeal
was with which thcv were animated, they could
not have accompliihed their pulpole, or even
have reached the feat of their warfare, without
securing the aflittance of the Italian flates.
None of the other European },twers could ci

ever was wanting, engrofled all the profits of S E C T.
a branch of commerce which, in every age, II
has been extremely lucrative. It was with all ~
the interelted attention of merchants, that the
Italians afforded their aid. On the reduction
of any place in which they found it for their
intereit to fettle. they obtained from the cru-
faders vautable immunities of different kinds;
freedom of tradle; an abatement of the ulual
duties paid tor x hat was imported and exported,
or a total exemption from them; the property
of entire lububs in lome cities, and of ex-
tenlive ftrects in others ; and a privilege granted
to every per!on who relided within their pre-
cincts, or who traded under their protecion,
of ':cing t:-icd by their own laws, and by judges
of th-ir oni appoinment . In consequence
of so many advantagcs, e can trace, dring
the progrels of the cruadcs, a rapid increale
of wealth and of power in all the commercial
Itates of Italy. :very port open to trade was
frequented Iy their merchants, who, having
now engrossed entirely the commerce of the
East, tlrove with such active emulation to find

therto been little knoxn.

Two events happened, prior to the termi-

nation of the Hol\ War, which, by acquiring
to the Venetians and Genoese the poffeflion of
several provinces in the Greek empire, enabled
them to supply Europe inore aun :antlv with

S E C T. Venetians, and the leaders of the fourth cru-

III. fade. An account of the political interests
v^^ and intrigues which formed this alliance, and

turned the hallowed arms deltiied to deliver
the Holy City from the dominiun of infidels,
against a Christian monarch, is foreign from the
design of this Disquisition. Conltantinople
was taken by storm, and plundered by the con-
federates. An earl of Slanders was placed on
the Imperial throne. The dominion which still
remained subject to the fuccffrs of Conltan-
tine, were divided into four parts, one of which
being allotted to the new emperor, for support-
ing the dignity and expence of government,
an equal partition cf the other three was made
between the Venetians and the chiefs of the
crusade. The former, who, both inconcerting
and in conducing this enterprise, kept their
eye steadily fixed on what might be most for
the emolument of their commerce, secured the
territories of greatest value to a trading peo-
ple. They obtained some part of the Pelopon-
nefus, at that time the feat of flouriflhing ma-
nufatures, particularly of silk. 'Ihey became
mailers of several of the largest and best cul-
tivated islands in the Archipelago, and efta-
bliflied a chain of settlements, partly military,
and partly commercial, extending from the
Adriatic to the Bosphorus . Many Venetians
fettled in Constantinople, and without obflruc-
tion from their warlike associates, little attentive
to the arts of industry, they engrofled the va-
rious branches of trade which had so long en-
riched that capital. Two of these particularly
attracted their attention; the silk trade, and

that

that with India. From the reign of Justinian, S E C T.
it was moftiy in Greece, and some of the adja- I l
cent islands, that silk-worms, which he firlft
introduced into Europe, were reared. The
product of their labours was manufatured into
ItuTs of various kinds in many cities of the
empire. But it was in Confla.ntinople, the
se':t of opulence and luxury, that the denand
fc-r a com:nedit) of such high p:;ce was
greateli, and riere, of confcquence, the com-
:nLre ors ilO naturally centered. In assorting
caroc: for the several ports in which they trad-
ed, the Venetians had lor obme time found
silk to be an ellential article, as it continued to
grow more and more into request in every part
of Europe. By the residence of so many of
their citizens in Constantinople, and by the
immunities granted to them, they not only pro-
cured silk in such abundance, and on such
terms, as enabled them to carry on trade more
extensively, and with greater profit than for-
merly, but they became so thoroughly acquaint-
ed with every branch of the silk manufacure,
as induced them to attempt the etablifhment
of it in their own dominions. The measures
taken for this purpose by individuals, as well
as the regulations framed by the fate, were
concerted with so much prudence, and executed
with such success, that in a short time the silk
fabrics of Venice vied with those of Greece and
Sicily, and contributed both to enrich the re-
public, and to enlarge the sphere of its com-
merce. At the fame time, the Venetians a-
vailed themselves of the influence which they
had acquired in Contantinople, in order to
improve their Indian trade. ' he capital of the
Greek empire, besides the means of being sup-
plied with the productions of the East, which
it enjoyed in common with the other commer-

cial

i05

S E C T cial cities of Europe, received a considerable

ItI. portion of them by a channel peculiar to itself.

Some of the most valuable commodities of In-
dia and China were conveyed over land, by
routes which I have described, to the Black
Sea. and thence by a short navigation to Con-
ftantinople. 1'o this market, the bet Itored
of any except Alexandria, the Venetians had
now eafv access, and the goods which they pur-
chased there, made an addition of great confe-
quence to what they were accustomed to ac-
quire in the ports of Egypt and Syria. Thus
while the Latin empire in Constantinople sub-
fited, the Venetians poffeiTed such advantages
over all their rivals, that their commerce ex-
tended greatly, and it was chiefly from them
every part of Europe received the commodities
of the Eait.

THE other event which I had in view, was

the subversion of the dominion of the Latins in
Constantinople, and the re-eftablifliment of the
Imperial family on the throne. This was
effected after a period of fifty seven years, partly
by a transient effort of vigour, with which in-
dignation at a foreign yoke animated the Greeks,
and partly by the powerful aliiltance which
they received from the republic of Genoa. The
Genoese were so lenfible of the advantages
which the Venetians, their rivals in trade, de-
rived from their union with the Latin emperors
of Constantinople, that in order to deprive
them of there, they surmounted the most deep-
rooted preiudices of teir age, and combined
with the :chifmatic Greeks to dethrone a monarch
protected by the Papal power, setting at defiance
the thunders of the Vatican, which at that
time made the grcatell princes tremble. This
undertaking, bold and impious as it was then

deemed,
1 3

deemed, proved successful. In recompence for S E C T.
their signal services, the gratitude or weakness All
of the Greek emperor, among other donations,
bellowed upon the Genoese Pera, the chief
suburb of Constantinople, to be held as a fief
of the empire, together with such exemption
from the accustomed duties on goods imported
and exported, as gave them a decided fuperio-
rity over every competitor in trade. With the
vigilant attention of merchants, the Genoese
availed themselves of this favourable situation.
They surrounded their new settlement in Pera
with fortifications. They rendered their sac-
tories on the adjacent coalts places of trength".
'Ihev were malters of the harbour of Conltan-
tinople more than the Greeks themselves. The
whole trade of the Black Sea came into their
hands; and not satisfied with this, they took
poffellion of part of the (:herfonefus Taurica,
the modern Crimaca, and rendered Caffa, its
principal town, the chief feat of their trade
with the East, and the port in which all its
produtions, conveyed to the Black Sea by the
different routes I have formerly described, were
landed '.

IN consequence of this revolution, Genoa

became the greatest commercial power in Eu-
rope; and if the enterprising industry and in-
trepid courage of its citizens had been under
the diretion of wife domestic policy, it might
have long held that rank. But never was there
a contrail more striking, than between the in-
ternal administration of the two rival republics

E C T. of Venice and Genoa. In the former, go.

.vernment was conducted with steady systematic
-^>' prudence; in the latter, it was consistent in

nothing but a fondness for novelty, and a pro-
penfity to change. The one enjoyed a perpetual
calm, the other was agitated with all the storms
and vicissitudes of faction. The increase of
wealth, which flowed into Genoa from the ex-
ertions of its merchants, did not counterbalance
the defects in its political constitution; and
even in its most prosperous state we may dif.
cern the appearance of symptoms which fore-
boded a diminution of its opulence and power.

As long, however, as the Genoese retained

the acendant which they had acquired in the
Greek empire, the Venetians felt their con.
mercial tranfacions with it to be carried on
upon such unequal terms, that their merchants
visited Constantinople seldom, and with reluc-
tance; and in order to procure the commodities
of the Ea; in such quantities as were demanded
in the various parts of Lurope which they
were accustomed to fu:plv, they were obliged
to resort to the ancient staples of that trade.
Of these Alexandria was the chief, and the mofl
abundantly supplied, as the conveyance of In-
dian goods by land through Asia, to any of the
ports of the Mediterranean, was often renderec
impracticable by the incursions of Turks, Tar
tars, and other hordes, which successively defo
lated that fertile country, or contended for the
dominion of it. But under the military and vi
gorous government of the S Idans of the Ma
meluks, ecurity and order were steadily main
tained in Egypt, and trade, though loaded witi
heavy duties, was open to all. In proportior
to the progress of the Genoese, in engrof
sing the commerce of Conflantinople and thi

Blacl
Is

Black Sea , the Venetians found it more and S E C T.
more necessary to enlarge their tran'aitions with Itl.
Alexandria.

BUT such an avowed intercourse with infidels

being confidered, in that age, as unbecoming
the character of Chriitians, ti.e fsrate of Ve-
nice, in order to filcn:e its own scruples, or
those of its fubjeas, had recourse to the ilfalli-
ble authority of the Pope, who was supposed to
be possessed of po, er to dispense with the rigo-
rous observation of the most sacred laws, and
obtained permission from him to fit. out annually
a specified number of hips for the ports of
Egypt and of Syria". Under this fandion, the
republic concluded a treaty of commerce with
the Soldans of Egypt, on equitable terms; in
consequence of which the senate appointed one
consul to reside in Alexandria, and another in
Damascus, in a public character, and to exer-
cifea mercantile jurifdicion, authoriled by the
Soldans. Under their protecion, Venetian
merchants and artisans fettled in cach of thef
cities. Ancient prejudices and antipathies were
forgotten, and their mutual interests established,
for the first time, a fair and open trade between
Christians and Mahomedans'.

WHILE the Venetians and Genoese were al-

ternately making those extraordinary efforts, in
order to engross all the advantages of supplying
Europe with the producions of the East, the
republic of Florence, originally a commercial
democracy, applied with such persevering vigour
to trade, and the genius of the people, as r il
as the nature of their institutions, were i fa-

S E C T. vourable to its progress, that the state advanced
IL, rapidly in power, and the people in opulence.

But as the Florentines did not pofrefs any com-
modious sea-port, their active exertions were
directed chiefly towards the improvement of
their manufactures, and domeltic industry. A-
bout the beginning of the fourteenth centurv,
the Florentine manufactures of various kinds,
particularly those of silk and woollen cloth, ap-
pear from the enumeration of a well-informed
Historian, to have been very considerable -. The
connection which they formed in different parts
of Europe, by furnishing them with the pro-
duetions of their own industry, led them to en-
gage in another branch of trade, that of bank-
ing. In this they soon became so eminent,
that the money-tranfactions of almost every
kingdom in Europe pased through their hands,
and in many of them they were entrusted with
the collection and administration of the public
revenues. In consequence of the activity and
success with which they conducted their ma-
nufatures and money-tranfactions, the former
always attended with certain, though moderate
profit, the latter lucrative in an high degree,
at a period when neither the interest of money,
nor the premium on bills of exchange, were
fettled with accuracy, Florence became one of
the first cities in Chriffendom, and many of its
cities extremely opulent. Cosmo di Medici,
the head of a family which rose from obscurity
by its success in trade, was reckoned the moit
wealthy merchant ever known in Europe'; and
in acts of public munificence, as well as of pri-
vate generosity, in the patronage of learning,

and in the encouragement of useful and elegant S E C T.
arts, no monarch of the age could vie with him. III.
Whether the Medici, in their first mercantile '
tranfacions, carried on any commerce with the
East, Ihave not been able to discover '. It is
more probable, I hould think, that their trade
was confined to the fame articles with that of
their countrymen. But as soon as the com-
monwealth, by the conquest of Pisa, had ac-
quired a communication with the ocean, Cofino A C
di Medici, who had the chief diretion of its 14G-
affairs, endeavoured to procure for his country
a share in that lucrative commerce, which had
raised Venice and Genoa so far above all the
other Italian tates. With this viewambaffadors A. C.
were sent to Alexandria, in order to prevail '4:;.
with the Soldan to open that, and the other
ports of his dominions, to the fubje'ts of the
republic, and to admit them to a participation
of all the commercial privileges which were en-
joyed by the Venetians. The negociation ter-
minated with such success, that the Florentines
seem to have obtained foine share in the Indian
trade ; and soon after this period, we find
spices enumerated among the commodities im-
ported by the Florentines into England'.

IN some parts of this Disquisition, concerning

the nature and courle of trade with the EaRt, i
have been obliged to grope my way, and often
under the guidance of very feeble lights. But
as we are now approaching to the period when
the modern ideas, with refpe& to the importance
of commerce, began to unfold, and attention
to its progress and effecds became a more con-
fiderable objec of policy, we may hope to carry

S E C T. on what researches yet remain to be made, with

II- greater certainty and precision. To this grow-

iag attention we are indebted for the account
which Marino Sanudo, a Venetian nobleman,
gives of the Indian trade, as carried on by his
countrymen, about the beginning of the four-
teenth century. They were supplied, as he in-
forms us, with the productions of the aft in
two different wavs. Those of fall bulk and
high value, such as cloves, nutmegs, mace,
gems, pearls, &c. were convved from the Per-
fian Gulf up the Tigris to Ballbra, and thence
to Bigdat, from which they were carried to
some por- on the Mediterranean. All more
bulky oojs, such as pepper, ginger, cinnamon,
S c. trcgerhr with i ome portion of the more
valuable articles, were conveved by the ancient
route to the Red Sea, and thence across the
defart, and down the Nile to Alexandria. The
goods received by the former route were, as
Sanudo observes, of:a uperior quality; but from
the tedioufne, and expence of a distant land-
carriage, the supply was often scanty, nor can
he conceal (though contrary to a favourite pro-
jec which he had in view when he wrote the
treatise to which I refer) that, from the slate of
the countries through which the caravans passed,
this mode of conveyance was frequently preca-
rious, and attended with danger .

Ir was in Alexandria only, that the Veneti-

ans found always a certain and full supply of
Indian goods; and as these were conveyed thi-
ther chiefly by water-carriage, they might have
purchased them at a moderate price, if the Sol-
dans had not imposed upon them duties which

amounted to a third part of their value. Under s E C T.
this and every other disadvantage, however, it III.
was necessary to procure them, as from many 'v
concurring circumstances, particularly a more
extensive intercourse established among the dif-
ferent nations of Europe, the demand for them
continued to increase greatly during the four-
teenth century. By the irruptions of the various
hostile tribes of Barbarians, who took polfefion
of the greater part of Europe, that powerful
bond by which the Romans had united together
all the people of their vail empire was entirely
dissolved, and such discouragement was given
to the communication of one nation with ano-
ther, as would appear altogether incredible, if
the evidence of it refled only upon the testimony
of historians, and were not confirmed by what
is still more authentic, the express enadment
of laws. Several ltatutes of this kind, which
disgrace the jurisprudence of almost every Eu-
ropean nation, I have enumerated and explained
in another work ". But when the wants and
desires of men multiplied, and they found that
other countries could furnilh the means of sup-
plying and gratifying them, the hostile senti-
ments which kept nations at a distance from
each other abated, and mutual correspondence
gradually took place. From the time of the
crusades, which first brought people hardly
known to one another, to associate and to ad
in concert during two centuries, in pursuit of
one common end, several circumstances had
co-operated towards accelerating this general

bY] - them together in the powerful commercial con-

federacy so famous in the middle ages, under
the name of the Hanseatic League, and led
them to etablifh the staple of their trade with
the southern parts of Europe in Bruges. Thi-
ther the merchants of Italy, particularly thofc
of Venice, resorted; and in return for the pro-
dutions of the East, and the manufactures of
their own country, they received not only the
naval stores and other commodities of the
North, but a considerable supply of gold and
silver from the mines in various provinces of
Germany, the most valuable and productive of
any known at that time in Europe °. Bruges
continued to be the great mart or store-house
of European trade during the period to which
my inquiries extend. A regular communication,
formerly unknown, was kept up there among
all the kingdoms into which our continent is
divided, and we are enabled to account for the
rapid progress of the Italian states in wealth
and power, by observing how much their trade,
the source from which both were derived, mut
have augmented upon the vast increase in the
consumption of Asiatic goods, when all the
extensive countries towards the north-east of
Europe were opened for their reception.

DURtING the prosperous and improving state

of Indian commerce, Venice received from one
of its citizens, such new information concern-

tide of its trade, as gave an idea of their opu- S E T.
lence, their population, and their extent, which III.
rose far above all the former co~eptions of Eu-
ropeans. From the time that the Mahomedans
became masters of Egypt, as no chriltian was
permitted to pass through their dominions to
the East P, the diret intercourse of Europeans
with India ceased entirely. The account of
India by Cofinas Indico-pleuftes in the sixth
century, is, as far as I know, the last which
the nations of the Weft received from any per-
Ion wan had visited that country. But about
the middle of the thirteenth century, the spirit
of commerce now became more enterprizing,
and more eager to discover new routes which
led to wealth, induced Marco Polo, a Venetian
of a noble family, after trading for ome time
in many of the opulent cities of the lesser Asia,
to penetrate into the more eastern parts of that
continent, as far as the court of the Great Khan
on the frontier of China. During the course
of twenty-fix years, partly employed in mer-
cantile tranfadions, and partly in conduaing
negociations with which the Great Khan en-
trulfed him, he explored many regions of the
East which no European had ever visited.

He describes the great kingdom of Cathay,

the name by which China is still known in many
parts of the Eaf , and travelled through it
from Chambalu, or Peking, on its northern
frontier, to some of its most southern provinces.
He visited different parts of Indoftan, and is the
first who mentions Bengal and Guzzerat, by
their present names, as great and opulent king-

111 nies by land, he made more than one voyage ill
'kc~- the Indian ocean and acquired some information

concerfin an ifand which he calls Zipangri or
Cipango, probably Japan. He visited in per.
son Java, and several islands contiguous to it,
the island of Ceylon, and the coast of Malabar
as far as the Gulf of Cambay, to all which he
gives the names that they now bear. This was
the most extensive survey hitherto made of the
Eait, and the molf complete description of it
ever given bv any European; and in an age
which had hardly any knowledge of those re-
gions but what was derived from the geogra-
phy of Ptolemy, not only the Venetians, but
all the people of Europe, were astonished at
the discovery of immense countries opened to
their view beyond what had hitherto been re-
puted the utmofl boundary of the earth in that

trade, the progrels of which I am en, eavouring

calamity, were obliged not only to abandon that S E C T.
fettlemept, but all those which they had made III.
on the adjacent sea-coast, after they had been '"''
in their pofleffion near twocenturies. Not long A. D.
after, the victorious arms of the Sultan expelled '47+
them from Caffa, and every other place which
they held in the Crimea . Constantinople was
no longer a mart open to the nations of the
Weft for Indian commodities, and no supply of
them could now be obtained Iut in Egypt and
the ports of Syria, subjec to the Soldans of the
Mameluks. The Venetians, in consequence
of the protecfion and privileges which they had
secured by their commercial treaty with those
powerful princes, carried on trade in every part
of their dominions with such advantage, as
gave them a superiority over every competitor.
Genoa, which had long been their molt formi-
dable rival, humbled by the loss of its poffellions
in the East, and weakened by domeftie dif'en-
sions, declined so fallt, that it vwas obliged to
court foreign protetion, and submitted alter-
nately to the dominion of the Dukes of Milan
and the Kings of France. In conlcquence 'of
this diminution of their political power, the
commercial exertions of the Genoese became
less vigorous. A fe ble attempt hWich they
made to recover that hare of the Indian trade
which thev had formerly enjoyed, by offering
to enter into treaty with the Soldans of Egypt
upon terms imilar to those hich had been
granted to the Venetians, proved unsuccessful;
and during the remainder of the fifteenth cen-
tury, Venice supplied the greater part of Eu,
rope with the productions of the East, and car-

S E C T. ried on trade to an extent far beyond what had

III. been known in those times.

TH state of the other Et;ropean nations was

extrcmelv favoura-le to the commercial pro.
gre' of the Venetians. England, dfolated by
the ci\il wars w'hich the unhappy contest between
the houses of York and Lancalter excited, had
hardly begun to turn is attention towards those
objects and pursuits to which it is indebted for
its present opulence and power. In France, the
fatal effecs of the Englilh arms and conquests
were still felt, and the king had neither acquired
power, nor the people inclination, to diret the
national genius and activity to the arts of peace.
The union of the different kingdoms of Spain
was not yet completed; some of its molt fertile
provinces were fill under the dominion of the
Moors, with whom the Spanfli monarchs waged
perpetual war; and, except by the Catalans,
little attention was paid to foreign trade. Por-
tugal, though it had already entered upon that
career of discovery which terminated with most
fpTendid success; had not yet made such progress
in it as to be entitled to any high rank among
the commercial fiates of Europe. Thus the
Venetians, almost without rival or competitor,
except from some of the inferior Italian Itates,
were left at liberty to concert and to execute
their mer, :-.-tile plans; and the trade with the
cities oi [le -lanfeatic League, which united
the North and South of Europe, and which hi-
therto had been common to all the Italians,
was now engrossed, in a great measure, by them
alone.

W .H!LE the increasing demand for the pro-

ductions es Asia induced all the people of Eu-
rope to court mterccurfe with the Venetians bs

eagerly,
TT8

eagerly, as to allure them, by various immu. S E C T.
nities, to frequent their sea-ports, we may ob- Ill.
serve a peculiarity in their mode of carrying on - v
trade with the East, which distinguishes it from
what has taken place in other countries in any
period of history. In the ancient world, the-
Tyrians, the Greeks who were mailers of
Egypt, and the Romans, failed to India in quell
of those commodities with which they supplied
the people of the Weft. In modern times, the
fame has been the pracice of the Portuguese,
the Dutch, the Englilh, and, after their exam.
ple, of other European nations. In both pe-
riods loud complaints have been made, that in
carrying on this trade every fRate mult be drained
of the precious metals which, in the course of
it, flow incessantly from the Weft to the aift,
never to return. From whatever loss might
have been occasioned by this gradual bt una-
voidable diminution of their gold and fiv er
(whether a real or only an imaginary loss, it is
not incumbent upon me, in this place, to in.
quire or to determine), the Venetians were, in
a great measure, exempted. They had no di.
rea intercourse with India. They found in
Egypt, or in Syria, ware.houses filled with all
the commodities of the East, imported by the
Mahomedans; and from the belt accounts we
have, with refpe& to the nature of their trade,
they purchased them more frequently by barter,
than with ready money. Egypt, the chief
mart for Indian goods, though a molt fertile
country, is destitute of many things requisite
in an improved state of society, either for ac-
commodation or for ornament, Too limited
in extent, and too highly cultivated to afford
space for forests; too level to have mines of the
useful metals; it must be supplied with timber
for building, with iron, lead, tin, and brass,

by

119

E C T. by importation from other countries. The
III- Egyptians, while under the dominion of the

Mameluks, seem not themselves to have traded
in the ports of any Christian slate, and it was
principally from theVenetians that they received
all the articles which I have enumerated. Be-
fides these, the ingenuity of the Venetian artists
furnished a variety of manufatures of woollen
cloths, silk stuffs of various fabric, camblets,
mirrors, arms, ornaments of gold and silver,
glass, and many other articles, for all which
they found a ready market in Egypt and Syria.
In return they received from the merchants of
Alexandria, spices of every kind, drugs, gems,
pearls, ivory, cotton and silk, unwrought as
well as manufactured, in many different forms,
and other productions of the East, together with
several valuable articles of Egyptian growth or
fabric. In Aleppo, Baruth, and other cities,
befi3es the proper commodities of India brought
thither by land, they added to their cargoes
the carpets of Persia, the rich wrought silks of
Damascus, still known by a name taken from
that city, and various produtions of art and
nature peculiar to Syria, Palefline, and Arabia.
If, at any time, their demand for the produc-
tions of the East went beyond what they could
procure in exchange for their own manufac-
tures, that trade with the cities of the Hanseatic
League, which I have mentioned, furnished
them from the mines of Germany, with a re-
gular supply of gold and silver, which they could
carry, with advantage, to the markets of Egypt
and Syria,

been interposed, both in direcing the importa- S E C T.
tion of Asiatic goods, and in the mode of cir- 1I
culating them among the different nations of
Europe. To every considerable staple in the
Mediterranean, a certain number of large vef.
fels known by the name of G'cons or Caracks,
was fitted out on the public account, and re-
turned loaded with the richest merchandise , the
profit arising from the sale of which muff have
been no slender addition to the revenue of the
republic. Citizens, however, of every class,
particularly persons of noble families, were en-
couraged to engage in foreign trade, and who-
ever employed a vessel of a certain burden for
this purpose, received a considerable bounty
from the tate . It was in the fame manner,
partly in ships belonging to the public, and partly
in those of private traders, that the Venetians
circulated through Europe the goods imported
from the East, as well as the produce of their
own dominions and manufatures.

THERE are two different ways by which we

may come at some knowledge of the magnitude
of those branches of commerce carried en by
the Venetians. The one, by attending to the
great variety and high value of the commodi-
ties which they imported into Bruges, the store-
house from which the other nations of Europe
were supplied. A full enumeration of there is
given by a well-informed author, in which is
contained almost every article deemed, in that
age, eflential to accommodation or to ele-
gance ". The other, by confidering the effets

S E C T. of the Venetian trade upon the cities admitted

III. to a participation of its advantages. Never did

wealth appear more confplcuoufly in the train
of commerce. The citizens of Bruges, en.
riched by it, displayed in their dress, their
buildings, and mode of living, such magnifi-
cence as even to mortify the pride and excite
the envy of royalty . Antwerp, when the
staple was removed thither, soon rivalled Bru-
ges in opulence and splendour. In ome cities
of Germany, particularly in Augsburg, the
great mart for Indian commodities in the inte-
rior parts of that extenfiv- country, we meet
with early examples of such large fortunes accu-
mulated by mercantile industry, as raised the
proprietors of them to high rank and confidera-
tion in the empire.

FROM observing this remarkable increase of

opulence in all the places where the Venetians
had an eflablifhed trade, we are led to con-
clude, that the profit accruing to themselves
from the different branches of it, especially that
with the East, must have been frill more con-
fiderable. It is impossible, however, without
information much more minute than that to
which we have access, to form an tflimate of this
with accuracy but various circumstances may
be produced to establish, in general, the justness
of this conclusion. From the first revival of a
commercial spirit in Europe, the Venetians pof-
sessed a large share of the trade with the East.
It continued gradually to increase, and during
a great part of the fifteenth century, they had
nearly a monopoly of it. This wasprodutive
of consequences attending all monopolies.

chant has it in his power to regulate the market, S F T.
and to fix the price of the commodities which III.
he vends, his gains will b exorbitant. Some -'
idea of their magnitude, during leveral centu-
ries, may be formed, by attending to the rate
of the premium or interest then paid for the
use of money. This is undoubtedly the most
exa& standard by which to measure the profit
arising from the capital flock employed in conm-
merce; for, according as the interest of money
is high or low, the gain acquired by the use of
it must vary, and become excessive or moderate.
From the close of the eleventh century to the
commencement of the sixteenth, the period
during which the Italians made their c! i f com-
mercial exertions, the rate of inteieit was ex-
tremely high. It was usually twenty per cent.
sometimes above that'; and so late as the year
one thousand five hundred, it had not funk be-
low ten r twelve per cent. in ar part of Eu.
rope '. If the profits of a trade i-:, exenfiv as
that of the Venetians correspondcd tu this high
value of money, it could nt fail of proving a
source of great wealth, oth public and pri-
vate . 'iThe condition of Venice, accordingly,
during te period under review, is described by
writers of that age, in terms which are not ap-
plicable to th at of any other country i:i Europe.
The revenues of the republic, as well as the
wealth amassed by individuals, exceeded vhat.

of their houses, in richness of furniture, in
profusion of plate, and in every thing which con-
tributed either towards elegance or parade in
their inodeof living, the nobles of Venice fur-
passed the state of the greatest monarch beyond

II1. an ostentatious and inconsiderate dissipation, it

was the natural consequence of successful in-
duftrv, which, having accumulated wealth with
cafe, is entitled to enjoy it in splendour .

NEVER did the Venetians believe the power

of their country to be more firmly established,
or rely with greater confidence on the continu-
ance and increase of its opulence, than towards
the close of the fifteenth century, when two
events (which they could neither foresee nor
prevent) happened, that proved fatal to both.
The one was the discovery of America. The
other was the opening a direEt course of naviga-
tion to the East Indies, by the Cape of Good
Hope. Of all occurrences in the history of the
human race, there are undoubtedly among the
noft interesting; and as they occasioned a re-
markable change of intercourse among the dif-
ferent quarters of the globe, and finally efta.
blifbed those commercial ideas and arrangements
which constitute the chief diftinfion between
the manners and policy of ancient and of mo-
dern times, an account of them is intimately
connected with the subject of this Disquisition,
and will bring it to that period which I have
fixed upon for its boundary. But as I have re-
lated the rife and progress of these discoveries
at great length in another work ', a rapid view
of them is all that is requisite in this place.

TiFE admiration or envy with which the other

nations of Europe beheld the power and wealth
of Venice, led them naturally to enquire into
the caules of this pre-eminence; and among

tified with being excluded from a source of opu-
lence, which to the Venetians had proved so
abundant, different countries had attempted to
acquire a hare of the Indian trade. Some of
the Italian states (as I have formerly hinted) en-
deavoured to obtain admiflion into the ports of
Egypt and Syria, upon the fame terms with the
Venetians; but either by the superior interest
of the Venetians in the court of the Soldans,
their negociations for that purpose were ren-
dered unsuccessful; or from the manifold ad-
vantages which merchants, long in potfeflion of
any branch of trade, have in a competition with
new adventurers, all their exertions did not
produce effects of any consequence '. In other
countries, various schemes were formed with
the fame view. As early as the year one thou-
sand four hundred an.l eighty, the inventive and
enterprising genius of Columbus conceived the
idea of opening a florter and more certain com-
inunication with India, by holding a direc
westerly course towards those regions, which,
according to Marco Polo and other travellers,
extended eastward far beyond the utmost limits
of Asia known to the Greeks or Romans. This
scheme, supported by arguments deduced from
a scientific acquaintance with cosmography, from
his own practical knowledge of navigation,
from the reports of kilful pilots, and from the
theories and conjecures of the ancients, he pro-
posed first to the Genoese his countrymen, and
next to the king of Portugal, into whose ser-
vice he had entered. It was rejeced by the for-
mer from ignorance, and by the latter with cir-
cumitances most humiliating to a generous
mind. By perseverance, however, and address,
he at length induced the most wary and lealt

adventurous

S E C T. adventurous court in Europe to undertake the

IIL execution of his plan; and Spain, as the re.
^^^ ward of this deviation from its usual cautious

maxims, had the glory of discovering a new
world, hardly inferior in magnitude to a third
part of the habitable globe. Astonishing as the
success of Columbus was, it did not fully ac-
complifh his own wishes, or conduc him to
those regions of the East, the expectation of
reaching which was the original objec of his
voyage. The effees, however, of his discoveries
were great and extensive. By giving Spain
the poeffeflio of immense territories, abounding
in rich mines, and many valuable producions
of nature, several of which had hitherto been
deemed peculiar to India, wealth began to flow
so copiously into that kingdom, and thence was
so diffused over Europe, as gradually awakened
a general spirit ofindultry, and called forth ex-
ertions, which alone nmul have soon turned the
course of commerce into new channels.

BUT this was accomplihed more speedily,

as well as more completely, by the other great
event which I mentioned, the discovery of a
new route of navigation to the East by the Cape
of Good Hope. When the Portuguese, to
whom mankind are indebted for opening this
communication between the most remote p irts
of the habitable globe, undertook their first
voyage of discovery, it is probable that they
had nothing farther in view than to explore
those parts of the coasts of Africa which lay
nearest to their own country. But a Ipirit of
enterprise, when routed and put in motion, is
always progreflive; and that of the Portuguese,
though flw and timid in its first operations.,
gradually acquired vigour, and prompted them
to advance al ni the wciic;n hc:r. of ihe African

continent,
a26

continent, far beyond the utmost boundary of S E c T.
ancient navigation in that direcion. Encouraged III.
by success, it became more adventurous, despised '-V
dangers which formerly appalled it, and fur.
mounted difficulties which it once deemed in-
superable. When the Portuguese found in the
torrid zone, which the ancients had pronounced
to be uninhabitable, fertile countries, occupied
by numerous nations; and perceived that the
continent of Africa, instead of extending in
breadth towards the Weft, according to the
opinion of Ptolemy, appeared to contract itself,
and to bend Eastwards, more extensive prof-
peds opened to their view, and inspired them
with hopes of reaching India, by continuing to
hold the fame course which they had so long
pursued.

AFTER several unsuccessful attempts to ac.

complilh what they had in view, a small fqua-
dron failed trom the T'aeus, under the command
of Vasco de Gania, an officer of rank, whose
abilities and courage fitted him to condut the
molt difficult and arduous enterprises. From
unacquaintance, however, with the proper season
and route of navigation in that vast ocean
through which he had to fleer iis course, his
voyage was long and dangerous. At length he
doubled that promontory, which, for several
years, had been the objed of terror and of
hope to his countrymen. From that, after a
prosperous navigation along the south-east of
Africa, he arrived at the city of Melinda, and
had the fatisfation of discovering there, as
well as at other places where he touched, peo-
ple of a race very different from the rude inha-
bitants of the Western hore of that continent,
which alone the Portuguese had hitherto vilited.
These he found to be far advanced in civilizae
tion, and acquaintance with the various arts of

life,

IIl. not only with the nations on their own coast,
'--V- but with-remote countries of Asia. Condu&ed

by their-pilots, who hel a course (with which
experience had rendered them well acquainted)
he failed across -the Indian ocean, and landed at
Calecut, on the coat of Malabar, on the twen-
ty-fecond of May, one thousand four hundred
and ninety-eight, ten months and two days
after his departure from the port of Lilbon.

- TiH Samorin, or Monarch of the country,
astonished at this unexpected visit of an un-
known people, whose apec, and arms, and
manners, bore no resemblance to any of the
nations accustomed to frequent his harbours,
and who-arrived in his dominions by a route
hitherr deemed impradicable, received them,
at fir, with .that fond admiration which is
often excited by'noveltyv But in a hort time,
as if he had been inspired with foresight of all
the calamities now approaching India by this
fatal communication opened with the.inhabi-
tants of Europe, he formed various schemes to
cut otF Gama and his followers. But from
every xnger to which he was exposed, either
by.the .open .attacks or secret machination of
the Indians, the Portuguese Admiral extricated
himnelf -with ingular prudence and intrepidity,
and at laftfailcd from Calecut with his ships
loaded, not only with the commodities peculiar
to that coast, but with many of the rich pro-
dutions of the Eaflern parts of India.

.ON his return to Lifon, he was received
with the admiration and gratitude due to a man,
who, by his superior abilities and retblution;
had conducted to such an happy issue an utl
dertaking f the greatest impurtance, which had

long occupied the thoughts of his Sovereign, S EC T.
and excited the hopes of his fellow-fubjecs . IlL
Nor did this event interest the Portuguese alone.
No nation in Europe beheld it with unconcern.
For although the discovery of a new world,
whether we view it as a display of genius in the
person who first conceived an idea of that un-
dertaking which led mankind to the knowledge
of it, whether we contemplate its influence
upon science by giving a more complete know-
ledge of the globe which we inhabit, or whether
we confider its effects upon the commercial in-
tercourfe of mankind, be an event far more
splendid than the voyage of Gama, yet the
latter seems originally to have excited more
general attention. The former, indeed, filled
the minds of the people with astonishment; it
was some time, however, before they attained
such a sufficient knowledge of that portion of
the earth now laid open to their view, as to
form any just idea, or even probable conjeure,
with refpe& to what might be the consequences
of communication with it. But the immense
value of the Indian trade, which both in ancient
and in modern times had enriched every nation
by which it was carried on, was a fubje& fami-
liar to the thoughts of all intelligent men, and
they at once perceived that the discovery of
this new route of navigation to the East, must
occasion great revolutions, not only in the
course of commerce, but in the political state
of Europe.

WHAT there revolutions were most likely to
be, and how they would operate, were points

K examined

S E C T. examined with particular attention in the cities

of Liibon and of Venice, but with feelings
very different. The Portuguese, founding up.
on the rights to which, in that age, priority of
discovery, confirmed by a papal grant, were
supposed to confer, deeming themselves intitled
to an exclusive commerce with the countries
which they had firfl visited, began to enjoy, by
anticipation, all the benefits of it, and to fancy
that their capital would soon be what Venice
then was, the great store-house of ealtem com-
modities to all Europe, and the feat of opulence
and power. On the first intelligence of Ga-
ma's successful voyage, the Venetians, with the
quick-fighted discernment of merchants, fore-
saw the immediate consequence of it to be the
ruin of that lucrative branch of commerce which
had contributedfo greatly to enrich and aggran-
dize their country; and they observed this with
more poignant concern, as they were apprehen-
five that they did not possess any effetual means
of preventing, or even retarding, its opera-
tion.

THE hopes and fears of both were well

founded. The Portuguese entered upon the new
career opened to them with aivity and ardour,
and mcade exertions, both commercial and mi-
litarv. far beyond what could have been ex-
pe&ed from a kingdom of such inconsiderable
extent. All there were dire&ed by an intelli-
gent monarch, capable of forming plans of the
greatefr magnitude with calm systematic wis-
dom, and of prosecuting them with unremitting
perseverance. The prudence and vigour of his
measures, however, would have availed little
without proper instruments to carry them into
execution. Happily for Portugal, the discern-
ing eye -of Emanuel feleted a succession of

officers

officers to take the supreme command in India, S E C T.
who, by their enterprizing valour, military lkill, nl
and political sagacity, accompanied with difin-
terested integrity, public spirit, and love of their
country, have a title to be ranked with the
persons most eminent for virtue and abilities
in any age or nation. Greater things perhaps
were atchieved by them, than were ever accom-
plifhed in so lhort a time. Before the close of
Emanuel's reign, twenty-four years only after
the voyage of Gama, the Portuguese had ren-
dered themselves masters of the city of Malacca,
in which the great staple of trade carried on
among the inhabitants of all those regions in
Asia, which Europeans have diftinguilhed by
the general name of the East Indies, was then
established. To this port, situated nearly at an
equal distance from the Eastern and Western
extremities of these countries, and poLfefing
the command of that firait, by which they keep
communication with each other, the merchants
of China, of Japan, of every kingdom on the
continent, of the Moluccas, and all the islands
in the Archipelago, resorted from the East,
and those of Malabar, of Ceylon, of Coroman-
del, and of Bengal, from the Weft'. This
conquest secured to the Portuguese great inflt-
ence over the interior commerce of India, while,
at the fame time, by their settlements at Goa
and Diu, they were enabled to engross the
trade of the Malabar coast, and to obftru:
greatly the long-eftablifhed intercourse of Egypt
with India by the Red Sea. Their hips tre.
quented every port in the EafR where valuable
commodities were to bt found, from the Cape
of Good Hope to the river of Canton; and

IL upwards of four thofa-n.d leagues ', they had

eftabliied, for the conveniency or protection
of trade, a chain of forts or satories. They
had likewise taken potfflon of stations moR
favourable to commerce along the Southern
coast of Africa, and iii - m y of the islands
which lie between Madagafear and the Moluc.

NoT satisfied with this ascendant which they

had acquired in India, the, Portuguese early
formed a cheme, no less bold than interested,
of excluding all other nations from participating
of the advantages of commerce with the East.
In order to effec this, it was necessary to ob-
tain poffeflion of such stations in the Arabian
and Persian Gulfs, as might render them maf-
ters of the navigation of these two inland seas,
and enable them -both to obftruf the ancient
commercial intercourse between Egypt and In-
dia, and to command the entrance of the great
rivers, which facilitated the conveyance of In.
'dian goods, not only through the interior pro-
vinces of Asia, but as far as Constantinople.

diftinguilhed themjfelve i -India. After .the ''-
utmost effortf:of genius and valour, he was able
:to accomplih -ore half -only Qs .what.the am-

secured to .Portugal that eatenfive tra.'e with

THE operations of Albuquerque in.tie Red

fuccets. Partly by the vigorous refileance of
the Arabian princes, whose ports he attacked,
and partly by the damage his. fleet sustained in
a sea of which the navigation is remarkably dif-
ficult and dangerous, he was constrained to re-
tire, without effeting -any fetlement. of i!n-

S E C T. the Portuguese had acquired in every port to

^_11 which they were accullomed to resort.

IN consequence of this, the Venetians soon

began to feel that decrease of their own Indian
trade which they had foreseen and dreaded. In
order to prevent the farther progress of this evil,
they persuaded the Soldan of the Manmeluks,
equally alarmed with themselves at the rapid fuc-
celf of the Portuguese in the aft, and no less
interested to hinder them from engrossing that
commerce, which had so long been the chief
source of opulence both to the monarchs and to
the people of Egypt, to enter into a negociation
with the Pope and the King of Portugal. The
tone which the Soldan assumed in this negocia-
tion was such as became the fierce chief of a
military government. After fating his exclu-
five right to the trade with India, he forewarned
Julius 11. and Emanuel, that, if the Portuguese
did not relinquish that new course of navigation
by which they had penetrated into the Indian
ocean, and cease from encroaching on that com-
merce, which from time immemorial had been
carried on between the Eait of Asia and his
dominions, he would put to death all the chris-
tians in Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, burn their
churches, and demolish the holy sepulchre it-
self . This formidable threat, which, a few
centuries before this period, would have made
ail hriltendom tremble, seems to have made
so little impression, that the Venetians, as the
last expedient, had recourse to a measure, which,
in that age, was deemed not only reprehensible,
but impious. They incited the Soldan to fit
out a feet in the Red Sea, and to attack those

nnexpeted invaders of a gainful monopoly, of S E C T.
which he and his predecessors had long enjoyed IIL
undisturbed poffeflion. As Egypt did not pro-
duce timber proper for building hips of force,
the Venetians permitted the Soldan to cut it in
their forests of Dalmatia, whence it was con-
veyed to Alexandria, and then carried, partly
by water and partly by land, to Suez. There
twelve hips of war were built, on board of
which a body of Mameluks was ordered to
serve, under the command of an officer of me-
rit. These new enemies, far more formidable
than the natives of India with whom the Por-
tuguefe had hitherto contended, they encoun-
tered, with undaunted courage, and after some
revere conflicts, they entirely ruined the squad-
ron, and remained matiers of the Indian
ocean .

SOON after this difafler, the dominion of the

Mameluks was overturned, and Egypt, Syria,
and Palestine were subjected to the Turkish em-
pire by the victorious arms of Selim 1. Their
mutual interest quickly induced the Turks and
Venetians to forget ancient animofities, and to
co-operate towards the ruin of the Portuguese
trade in India. With this view Selim confirmed
to the Venetians the extensive comriie;'cial pri:
vileges which they had enjoyed under the go.
vernment of the Mameluks, and published an
edit permitting the free entry of all the pro-
dutions of the EaR, imported direcTly from
Alexandria, into every part of his domii,:or:s,
and imposing heavy duties upon such as were
brought from Liibon '.

SE C T. BUT all these were unavailing efforts againfl

III. the superior advantages which the Portuguese
^'"~ pofleffed, in supplying Europe with the commo-

dities of the East, in consequence of having
opened a new mode of communication with it.
At the fame time, the Venetians, brought to
the brink of ruin by the fatal league of Cam-
brav, which broke the power and humbled the
pride of the republic, were incapable of such
efforts for the preservation of their commerce,
as they might have made in the more vigorous
age of their government,, and were reduced to
the feeble expedients of a declining slate. Of
this there is a remarkable instance in an offer
made to them by the King of Portugal in the
year one thousand five hundred- and twenty-one,
to purchase, at a stipulated price, all the spices
imported into Lisbon, over and above what
might be requisite for the consumption of his
own fubjets. If Emanuel had been so incon-
fiderate as to close with this proposal, Venice
would have recovered all the benefit of the
gainful monopoly which he had loft. But the
offer met with the reception that it merited, and
was rejected without hesitation ".

THE Portuguese, almost without obflruaion,

continued their progress in the East, until they
eitablifhed there a commercial empire; to
which, whether we confider its extent, its opu-
lence, the fender power by which it was formed,
or the fplndour with which the government
of it was conduted, there had hitherto been
nothing comparable in the history of nations.
Emanuel, who laid the foundation of this ftu-
pendous fabric, had the fatisfaaion to fee it
almost completed. Every part of Europe was

supplied by the Portuguese with the produtions S E'C T
of the Eat ; and if we except some inconfidera- IIL
ble quantity of them, which the Venetians still
continued to receive by the ancient channels of
conveyance, our quarter of the globe had no
longer any commercial intercourse with India,
and the regions of Asia beyond it, but by the
Cape of Good Hope.

THOUGH from this period the people of Eu-

rope have continued to carry on their trade with
India by sea, yet a considerable portior. of th:e
valuable productions of the East is still con-
veyed to other regions of the earth by land-car-
riage. In tracing the progress of trade with
India, this branch of it is an ojea of conli-
derable magnitude, which has not been exa-
mined with sufficient attention. That the an-
cients should have had recourie frequentls to te
tedious and expensive ntode of transporting
goods by land, will ndt appear surprising, -wiven
we recollet the imperfe&t 'ate of navigatiio
among them; The reafori f this mod6e of 6co-
veyance being not only'coritinued, but ii-
creased, in modern times, demanids fohi'expla-
nation.

IF we infpe a map of-Afia, we cannoit 'll

to observe, that the cimunication through all
the countries of that great continent iO rhe ';4t
of Indofltan and China,' though opened infoiire
degree towards'the south by the navigable ivers
Euphrates and T'iigris,' and towards ttie north
by two inland seas, the Euxine and Ciftiti,
muf be carried on inmi!.y extensive provinces
wholly by land. This, as have observed, i's
the first mode of intercourse between different
countries, and during the infancy of navigation
it was the only one. Even after that art had at-

tained

S E C T. tained some degree of improvement, the con.

veyance of goods by the two rivers which I
have mentioned, extended so little way into the
interior country, and the trade of the Euxine
and Caspian seas was so often obftruted by the
barbarous nations fcattcred along their ihores,
that, partly on that account, and partly by the
adherence of mankind to ancient habits, the
commerce of the various provinces of Asia,
particularly that with India and the regions
beyond it, continued to be conduced by
land.

THE fame circumstances which induced the

inhabitants of Asia to carry on such a confider-
able part of their commerce with each other in
this manner, operated with still more powerful
effect in Africa. That vast continent, which
little resembles the other divisions of the earth,
is not penetrated by inland seas, like Europe
and Asia, or by a chain of lakes, like North
America, or opened by rivers (the Nile alone
excepted) of extended navigation. It forms
one uniform, continuous surface, between the
various parts of which there could be no in-
tercourfe, from the earliest times, but by land.
Rude as all the people of Africa are, and flen-
der as the progress is which they have made in
the arts of life, such a communication appears
to have been always kept up. How far it ex-
tended in the more early periods to which I
have dire&ed my researches, and by what dif-
ferent routes it was carried on, I have not sus-
ficient information to determine with accuracy.
It is highly probable that, from time immemo-
rial, the gold, the ivory, the perfumes, both
cf the fcuthern parts of Africa, and of its
more northern diltiids, were conveyed either
to the Arabian Gulf, or to Egypt, and ex-

changed

changed for the spices and other producions of S E C T.
the East. III.

THE Mlahomedan religion, which spread with

amazing rapidity over all Asia and a confidera-
ble part of Africa, contributed greatly towards
the increase of commercial intercourse by land
in both these quarters of the globe, and has
given it additional vigour, by mingling with it
a new principle of aivity, and by direcing it
to a common centre. Mahomet enjoined all
his followers to visit once in their life-time, the
Caaba or square building in the temple of Mec-
ca, the immemorial objed of veneration among
his countrymen; and, according to their tra-
dition, the first spot on this earth which was
consecrated to the worship of God: In order to
preserve continually under their minds a sense
of their obligation to perform this duty, he
directed that, in all the multiplied as of de-
votion which his religion prescribes, true be-
lievers should always turn their faces towards
that holy place°. In obedience to a precept
solemnly enjoined and sedulously inculcated, nu-
merous caravans of pilgrims assemble annually
in every country where the Mahomedan faith is
eftabliffied. From the shores of the Atlantic
on one hand, and from the most remote re-
gions of the East on the other, the votaries of
the Prophet advance to Mecca. Commercial
ideas and objecs mingle with those of devotion.
The numerous camels P of each caravan are
loaded with those commodities of every country
which are of the easiest carriage and molt ready
sale. The holy city is crowded, not only with
zealous devotees, but with opulent merchants.

During

S C T. During the few days they remain there, the fair

III. of Mecca is the greaieft, perhaps, on the face

of the earth. Mercantile tranfa&ions are car-
ried on in it to an immense value, of which the
dispatch, the silence, the mutual confidence and
good faith in conducting them, are the most
unequivocal proof. The productions and mahu-
fa&ures of India form a capital article in this
great traffic, and caravans, on their return,
difeminate them through every part of Asia and
Africa. Some of these are deemed :necffary,
not only to the comfort, but to the preservation
of life, and otheriscothibute to its elegance
and pleasure. They are so various as to suit
the taste of mankind in every climate, and in
different Rages of improvement; and are in
high request among the rude natives of Africa,
as well as the more luxurious inhabitants of
Asia. In order to supply their several demands,
the caravans return loaded with the muslins
and chintzes of Bengal and the Deccan, the
shawls of Cachemire, the pepper of Malabar,
the diamonds of Golconda, the pearls of Kil-
kare, the cinnamon of Ceylon, the nutmeg
cloves and mace of the Moluccas, and an im-
mense number of other Indian commodities.

BESIDES these great caravans, formed partly

by refpet for a religious precept, and partly
with a view to extend a lucrative branch of
commerce, there are caravans, and these not
inconsiderable, composed entirely of merchants,
who have no objea but trade. These, at flated
seasons, set out from different parts of the
Turkish and Persian dominions, and proceeding
to Indoftan, and even to China, by routes
which were anciently known, they convey by
land-carriage the molt valuable commodities of
these countries to the remote provinces of both

to which large quanties of these commodities II.
are carried, and frequently across extensive de- '-

have been impassable, that we can form any
idea of the magnitude of the trade with India
by land, and are led to perceive, that in a Dif-
quifition concerning the various modes of cn-
dueing this commerce, it is well entitled to the

HISTORICAL DISQUISITION

CONCERNING
ANCIENT INDIA.

S E C T I ON IV.

General Obfervaticss.
S E C T. T HUS I have endeavoured to describe the

IV. l progress of trade with India, both by sea

and by land, from the earliest times in which
history affords any authentic information con-
cerning it, until an entire revolution was made
in its nature. and the mode of carrying it on,
by that great discovery which I originally fixed
as the utmost boundary of my inquiries. Here,
then, this Disquisition might have been termi-
nated. But as I have conducted my readers to
that period when a new order of ideas, and
new arrangements of policy began to be intro-
duced into Europe, in consequence of the va-
lue and importance of commerce being so
thoroughly understood, that in almost every
country the encouragement of it became a

chief
- ...

chief object of public attention; as we have SECT.
now reached that point whence a line may be Iv.
drawn which marks the chief diltinaion be- '
tween the manners and political institutions of
ancient and modern times, it will render the
work more inftrutive and useful, to conclude
it with some general observations, which natu-
rally arise from a survey of both, and a con-
parison of the one with the other. These ob.
servations, I trust, will be found, not only to
have an intimate connection with the subjea
of my researches, and to throw additional light
upon it; but will serve to illustrate many par.
ticulars in the general history of commerce,
and to point out effeas or consequences of va.
rious events, which have not been generally
observed, or confidered with that attention
which they merited.

I. AFTERI viewing the great and extensive

effets of finding a new course of navigation to
India by the Cape of Good Hope, it may ap.
pear surprising to a modern observer, that a
discovery of such importance was not made, or
even attempted, by any of the commercial
states of the ancient world. But in judging
with refpec to the condu& of nations in re-
mote times, we never err more widely, than
when we decide with regard to it, not according
to the ideas and views of their age, but of our
own. This is not, perhaps, more conspicuous
in any instance, than in that under confidera-
tion. It was by the Tyrians, and by the
Greeks, who were mailers of Egypt, that the
different people of Europe were sirs supplied
with the productions of the Eafr. From the
account that has been given of the manner in
which they procured these, it is manifest that
they had neither the fame inducements with

modern

143

S E C T. modern nations to wish for any new commu-
IV. nicarion w ilh India, nor the fame means of ac-

compliiing it. All the commercial tranfa&ions
of the ancients with the East were confined to
the ports on the Malabar cc-ft, or extended at
farthest to the island of C-vlon. To there
staples, the natives of all the different regions
in the eastern parts of Asia rcJught the com-
modities which were the growth of their fe-
veral countries, or the prduct of their inge-
nuity, in their own veftels, and with them the
flips from Tyre and from Egypt completed
their investments. While the operations of
their Indian trade were carried on within a
sphere so circumscribed, the conveyance of a
cargo by the Arabian Gulf, notwithstanding
the expence of land-carriage, either from Elath
to Rhinocclura, or across the defart to the
Nile, was so safe and commodious, that the
merchants of Tyre and Alexandria had little
reason to be solicitous for the discovery of any
other. The situation of both these cities, as
well as that of the other considerable com-
mercial states of antiquity, was very different
from that of the countries to which, in later
times, mankind have been indebted for keep-
ing up intercourse with the remote parts of the
globe. Portugal, Spain, England, Holland,
which have been most ative and successful in
this line of enterprise, all lie on the Atlantic
ocean, in which every European voyage of
discovery mult commence,) or have immediate
accefi to it. But Tyre was situated at the east-
crn extremity of the Mediterranean, Alexandria
not far from it; Rhodes, Athens, Corinth,
which came afterwards to be ranked among
the molt aive trading cities of antiquity, lay
considerably advanced towards the fame quarter
in that sea. The commerce of all these states
was long confined within the precincts of the

Mediterranean,
144

Mediterranean; and in some of them never ex- S E C T.
tended beyond it. The pillars of Hercules, or I V.
the Straits of Gibraltar, were long confidered
as the utmost boundary of navigation. To
reach this was deemed a signal proof of naval
kill; and before any of these gfates could give
a beginning to an attempt towards exploring
the vast unknown ocean which lay beyond it,
they had to accomplish a voyage (according to
their ideas) of great extent and much danger.
This was sufficient to deter them from engaging
in an arduous undertaking, from which, even
if attended with success, their situation pre-
vented their entertaining hopes of deriving great
advantage. ' '

BUT 'could we suppose the discovery of a new

paffagelo Iidia to have become an objet ofde.,
fire or pursuit to any of there states, their fci- -
ence as well as praaice of navigation was lbo
defe&ive, that it would have been hardly poffi-.
ble for them to attain it. The vessels which the,
ancients employed in trade were so small, as not .
to afford stowage for provisions sufficient to'fut.
sift a crew during a long voyage. Their con-- ,
ftruAion was-fuch that they could feldor ven-
ture to depart far fom land, 'and'theirmtide of
steering along the coast (which' I have been o- '
bliged to mention often) to circuitous n'd flow,
that from these as well as from other circum-
stances which I ight have specified , we tnay
pronounce a voyage from the Mediterranen to
India by the Cape of Good Hope, o have been
an undertaking beyond their power to accom-
plifh, in such a manner as to render it; in any
degree, subservient to commerce. - To this de-

' cifion,

S E C T eifion, the account preserved by Herodotus, of

IV a voyage performed by some Phenician hips

employed by a king of Egypt, which, taking
their departure from the Arabian Gulf, doubled
the Southern promontory of Africa, and ar-
rived, at the end of three years, by the Straits
of Gades, or Gibraltar, at the mouth of the
Nile , can hardly be confidered as repugnant;
for several writers of the greatest eminence
among the ancients, and most distinguished for
their proficiency in the knowledge of geography,
regarded this account rather as an amusing
tale, than the hillory of a real tranfacion; and
either entertained doubts con~ning the poffibi-
litv of failing round Africa, or absolutely de-
nied it . But if what Herodotus relates con-
cerning the course held by these Phenician ships
had ever been received by the ancients with ge-
neral assent, we can hardly fippofe, that any
/rate could have been so wildly adventurous, as
to imagine that a voyage, which it required three
years to compleat, could be undertaken with a
prospect of commercial benefit.

1I. TEE rapid progress of the moderns in

exploring India, as well as the extensive power
and valuable settlements wxhich they early ac-
quired there, mark such a diltinction between
their mode of condu&ing naval operations, and
that of the ancients, as merits to be confidered
and explained with attention. From the reign
of the first Ptolemy, to the conquest of Egypt
by the Mahomedans, Europe had been supplied
with the productions of the East by the Greeks
of Alexandria, by the Romans while they were

maifers of Egypt, and by the subje&s of the S E C T.
Emperors of Constantinople, whe that kingdom Iv1
became a province of their dominions. During
this long period, extending almost to a thousand
years, none of those people, the molt enlight-
ened, undoubtedly, in the ancient world, ever
advanced by sea farther towards the East than
the Gulf of Siam, and had no regular established
trade but with the ports on the coast of Mala-
bar, or those in the island of Ceylon. - They at-
tempted no conquests in any part of India, they
made no settlements, they ereted no forts.
Satisfied with an intercourse merely commercial,
they did not airt acquiring any degree of
power or dominion in the countries where they
traded, though it seems to be probable that they
might- have established it without much oppo-
fition from the natives, a gentle effeminate peo-
ple, with whom, at that time, no foreign and
more warlike race was mingled. But the enter-
prizing afivity of the Portuguese was not long
confined within the fame limits; a few years
after their arrival at Calccut, they advanced to-
wards the East, into regions unknown to the
ancients. The kingdoms of Cambodia, Cochin
China, Tonquin, the vast empire of China, and
all the fertile islands in the great Indian Archi-
pelago, from Sumatra to the Philippines, were
discovered, and the Portuguese, though opposed
in every quarter by the Mahomedans of Tartar
or Arabian origin fettled in many parts of India,
enemies much more formidable than the na-
tives, established there that extenfiveinfluence
and dominion which I have formerly de-
fcribed.

OF this remarkable difference between the

progress and operations of the ancients and mo-
derns in India, the imperfect knowledge of

L 2 the

147

S E C T the former, with refpec both to the theory and

r. practice of nvigation, seems to have been the

principal cau e. From the coast of Malabar to
the Philippines, was a voyage of an extent far
bevond any that the ancients were accustomed
to undertake, and, according to their manner
of failing, must have required a great length of
time to perform it. The nature of their trade
with India was such, that they had not (as I
have already observed) the fame inducements
with the moderns, to prosecute discovery with
ardour; and, according to the description given
of the vessels in which the merchants of Alex-
andria carried on their trade from the Arabian
Gulf, they appear to have been very unfit for
that purpose. On all these accounts, the anci-
ents remained satisfied with a slender knowledge
of India; and influenced by reasons proceed-
ing from the fame cause, they attempted neither
conq'ieft nor settlement there. In order to ac-
compliffi either of these, they must have tranf-
ported a considerable number of men from
India. But, from the defecive ftruture of
the:r ihins, as well as from the imperfecion of
their art in navigating them, the ancients seldom
ventured to convey a body of troops to any
difiance b lefa. From Berenice to Mufiris, was
to them, even aftcr Hippalus had discovered
the method of fleering a direc course, and
when their naval ikilT had attained to its highest
htate of improvement, a voyace of no less than
seventy days. By the ancient route along the
coalt of Persia, a oyage from the Arabian Gulf
to any part of India must have been of greater
length, and accomplished more slowly. As no
hoitile attack was ever nmad upon India by sea,
either by the Greek monarchs of Egypt, though
the two firit of thim was able and ambitious
Princes, or by the moit enterprizing of the

Roman
148

Roman Emperors, it is evident that they mull S E C T.
have deemed it an attempt beyondtheir power I-.
to execute. Alexander the Great, and, in imi-
tation of him, his successors, the monarchs of
Syria, were the only persons in the ancient
world who formed an idea of eftablithing their
dominion in any part of India; but it was with
armies led thither by land, that they hoped to
atchieve this.

III. The sudden effect of opening a diret

communication with the East, in lowering the
price of Indian commodities, is a circumfrance
that merits obfeiation. How compendious
soever the ancient intercourse with India may
appear to have been, it was attended with con-
fiderable expence. The productions of the re-
mote parts of Asia, brought to Ceylon, or the
ports on the Malabar coall, by the natives, were
puton board the hips which arrived from the
Arabian Gulf. At Berenice they were landed,
and carried by camels two hundred and fifty-
eight miles to the banks of the Nile. There
they were again embarked, and conveyed down
the river to Alexandria, whence they were dif-
patched to different markets. The addition to
the price of goods by such a multiplicity of ope-
rations mutl have been considerable, epecially
when the rate chargeable on each operation
was fixed by monopolists, subjed to no con-
troul. But after the passage to India by the Cape
of Good Hope was difcovred, its various corn.
modities were purchased at first hand in the
countries of which they were the growth or
manufature. In all these, particularly in In-
doftan and in China, the subsistence of man is
more abundant than in any other part of the
earth. The people live chiefly upon rice, the
most prolific of all grains. Population, of con-

.sequence,

149

s EC T. sequence, is so great, and labour so extremely

iV. cheap, that ever production of nature or of art

is fold at a very low price. When these were
shipped in different parts of India, they were
conveyed directly to Lisbon, by a navigation,
nlng indeed, but uninterrupted and safe, and
thence circulated through Europe. The car-
riage of mercantile goods by water is so much
less expensive than by any other mode of con-
vcyance, that as soon as the Portuguese could
import the productions of India in sufficient
quantities to supply the demands of Europe,
they were able to afford them at such a reduced
price, that the competition of the Venetians
ceased almost entirely, and the full stream of
commerce flowed in its natural direio to-
wards the cheapest market. In what proportion
the Portuguese lowered the price of Indian
commodities, I cannot ascertain with precision,
as I have not found in contemporary writers
sufficient information with refpe& to that point.
Some idea, however, of this, approaching per-
haps near to accuracy, may be formed, from
the computation of Mr. Alunn, an intelligent
English merchant. He has publilhed a table
of the prices paid for various articles of goods
in Indi., comp-red with the prices for which
they were fold in Aleppo, from which the dif-
ference appears to be nearly as three to one;
and he calculates, that, after a reasonable al-
lowance for the expence of the voyage from
India, the fame goods may be fold in England
at half the price v.hich they bear in Aleppo.
The expence cr cC..veying the produCtions of
Tlndiaup the Pera.n Gulf to-Baffora, and thence
either ihrol-;! ithe Great or Little Desert to
A!eppc, could not, I hould imagine, differ con-
ii2r-ablv from that by the Red Sea to Alexan-
d!ia. . e r;:.;-'' therer fppofe, that the Ve-

netians
150

netians might purchase them from the merchants s E C T.
of that city, at nearly the fame rate for which IV.
they were fold in Aleppo; and wien we add to - -
this, what they must have charged as their own
profit in all the markers which they frequented,
it is evident that the Portuguese might afford to
reduce the commodities of the als to a price
below that which I have mentioned, and might
supply every part of Europe with them more
than one-half cheaper than formerly. The en-
terprizing schemes of the Portuguese monarchs
were accomplished sooner, as well as more com-
pletely, than in the hour of molt anguine hope
they could have presumed to expect; and early
in thefixteenth century, their fubjets became
possessed of a monopoly of the trade with India,
founded upon the only equitable title, that of
furnishing its productions in greater abundance,
and at a more moderate price.

IV. WE may observe, that in consequence of

a more plentiful supply of Indian goods, and
at a cheaper rate, the demand for them in-
creased rapidly in every part of Europe. To
trace the progress of this in detail, would lead
me far beyond the period which I have fixed as
the limit of this D)isquisition, but some general
remarks concerning it will be found intimately
conne&ed with the fubje of my inquiries.
What were the chief articles of importation
from India, while the Romans had the direction
of the trade with that country, I have formerly
mentioned. But upon the subversion of their
empire, and the settlement of the fierce warriors
es Scythia and Germany in the various coun.
tries of Europe, the state of society, as well as
the condition of individuals, became so ex-
tremely different, that the wants and desires of
men were no longer the fame. Barbarians,

many

15l

S E C T. many of them not far advanced in their progress

n' beyond the rudefl state of social life, had little
""V i relish for those accommodations, and that ele-

gance, which are so alluring to poliihed nations.
The curious manufactures of silk, the precious
stones and pearls of the East, which had been
the ornament and pride of the wealthy and lux-
urious citizens of Rome, were not objects of
desire t men, who, for a considerable time as-
ter they took poffeflion of their new conquests,
retained the original simplicity of their pastoral
manners. They advanced, however, from rude.
ness to refinement in the usual course of pro-
grcfiion which nations are destined to hold, and
an increase of wants and desires requiring new
objecs to gratify them, they began to acquire
a relish for omen of the luxuries of India. A-
mong these they had a singular prediletion
for the fpiceries and aromatics which that
country yields in such variety and abundance.
Whence their peculiar fondness for these arose,
it is not of iportance to inquire. Whoever
peruses the writers of the middle ages, will find
many particulars which confirm this obferva.
tion. In every enumeration of Indian commo-
dities which they give, spices are always men-
tioned as the most considerable and precious
article'. In their cookery, all dishes were
highly seasoned with them. In every entertain-
ment of parade, a profusion of them was
deemed essential to magnificence. In every
medical prescription they were principal ingre-
dients '. But considerable as the demand for
spices had become, the mode in which the na-

tions of Europe had hitherto been supplied with S E C T.
them was extremely disadvantageous. The {hips Iv.
employed by the merchants of Alexandria never '-
ventured to visit those remote regions which
produce the most valuable pices, and before
they could be circulated through Europe, they
were loaded with the accumulated profits re-
ceived by four or five different hands through
which they had passed. But the Portuguese,
with a bolder spirit of navigation, having pe-
netrated into every part of Asia, took in their
cargo of spices in the places where they grew,
and could afford to dispose of them at such a
price, that, from being an expensive luxury,
they became an article of such general use, as
greatly augmented the demand for them. An
effect similar to this may be observed, with ref-
pea to the demand for other commodities im-
ported from India, upon the reduction of their
price by the Portuguese. From that period a
growing taste for Asiatic luxuries may be traced
in every country of Europe, and the number of
ships fitted out for that trade at Lisbon, continu-
ed to increase every year g.

V. LUCRATIVE as the trade with India was,

and had long been deemed, it is remarkable that
the Portuguese were suffered to remain in the
undisturbed and exclusive poffefiion of it, dur-
ing the course of almost a century. In the an-
cient world, though Alexandria, from the pe-
culiar felicity of its'fituation, could carry on
an intercourse with the East by ea, and circulate
its produ&ions through Europe with such ad-
vantage, as gave it a decided superiority over
every rival; yet various attempts ( hich 1 have
described in their proper places) were made,

from

154
S E C T. from time to time, to obtain some share in a

'.commerce so apparently beneficial. From the

growing activity of the commercial spirit in the
sixteenth centur, as well as from the example
of the eager solicitude with which the Veneti-
ans and Genoese exerted themselves alternately
to shut out each other from any {hare in the In-
dian trade, it might have been expeced that
some competitor would have arisen to call in
question the claim of the Portuguese to an ex-
clufive right of traffic with the East, and to
wrest from them some portion of it. There
were, however, at that time, some peculiar cir-
cumifances in the political Itate of those nations
in Europe, whose intrusion, as rivals, the Por-
tuguefe had any reason to dread, which secured
to them the quiet enjoyment of their monopoly
of Indian commerce, during such a long pe-
riod. From the accession of Charles V. to the
throne, Spain was either so much occupied in
a multiplicity of operations in which it was en-
gaged by the ambition of that monarch, and of
his son Philip II. or so intent on prosecuting its
own discoveries and conquests in the New
World, that, although, by the successful enter.

A. D. prize of Magellan, its fleets were unexpe&edly
J425. conduted by a new course to that remote region

of Asia which was the feat of the most gainful
and alluring branch of trade carried on by the
Portuguese, it could make no considerable es-
fort to avail itself of the commercial advanta-
es which it might have derived from that event.
.v the acquisition of the crown of Portugal, in
the year one thousand five hundred and eighty,
the kings of Spain, instead of the rivals, be-
came the protecors of the Portuguese trade,
and the guardians of all its extensive rights.
'1 hroughout the sixteenth century, the strength
and resources of France were so much wafted by
the fruitlels expeditions of their monarchs into

Italy,

Italy, by their unequal contest with the power S E C T.
and policy of Charles V. and by the calamities IV.
of the civil wars which desolated the kingdom V
upwards of forty years, that it could neither
bestow much attention upon objecs of com-
merce, nor engage in any scheme of distant en-
terprize. The Venetians, how sensibly soever
'they might feel the mortifying reverse of being
excluded, almost entirely, from the Indian
trade, of which their capital had been formerly
the chief feat, were so debilitated and humbled
by the League of Cambray, that they were no
longer capable of engaging in any undertaking
of magnitude. England, weakened (as I for-
merly observed) by the long contefi between
the houses of York and Lancaster, and just be-
ginning to recover its proper vigour, was re-
strained from aive exertion, during one part
of the sixteenth century, by the cautious max-
ims of Henry Vll. and wafted its strength, du-
ring another part of it, by engaging inconfide-
rately in the wars between the princes on the
continent. The nation, though destined to ac-
quire territories in India more extensive and va-
luable than were ever possessed by any European
power, had no such presentiment of its future
eminence there, as to take an early part in the
commerce or transactions of that country, and
a great part of the century elapsed before it be-
gan to turn its attention towards the East.

WHILE the most considerable nations in Eu-

rope found it necessary, from the circumstances
which I have mentiond, to remain inative
fpe&tators of what paiTed in the East, the Seven
United Provinces of the Low Countries, re-
cently formed into a finall fate, fill struggling
for political exiitence, and yet in the infancy of
its power, ventured to appear in the Indian
ocean as the rivals of the Portuguese; and, de-

spifing

S E C T. spifing their pretensions to an exclusive right of

IV. commerce with the extensive countries to the
*s' eastward of the Cape of Good Hope, invaded

that monopoly which they had hitherto guarded
with such zealous attention. The Englilh soon
followed the example of the Dutch, and both
nations, at firit by the enterprising industry of
private adventurers, and afterwards by the more
powerful efforts of trading companies, under
the protecion of public authority, advanced
with astonishing ardour and success in this new
career opened to them. The vast fabric of
power which the Portuguese had ected in the
East (a fuperftruclure much too large for the
basis on which it had to reft) was almost en-
tirely overturned, in as ihort time, and with as
much facility, as it had been raised. England
and Holland, by driving them from their molt
valuable settlements, and seizing the most lu-
crative branches of their trade, have attained to
that pre-eminence in naval power and commer-
cial opulence, by which they are distinguished
among the nations of Europe.

VI. TE co-incidence, in point of time, of

the discoveries made by Columbus in the Weft,
and those of Gama in the East, is a singular
circumstance, which merits observation, on ac-
count of the remarkable influence of those
events in forming or strengthening the commer-
cial connection of the different quarters of the
globe with each other. In all ages, gold and
silver, particularly the latter, have been the
commodities exported with the greatest profit to
india. In no part of the earth do the natives
depend so little upon foreign countries, either
for the necessaries or luxuries of life. The
blessings of a favourable climate and fertile foil,
augmented by their own ingenuity, afford
them whattcver they desire. In consequence of

this,

this, trade with them has always been carried s E C T.
on in one uniform manner, and the precious IV.
metals have been given in exchange for their v
peculiar producions, whether of nature or art\
But when the communication with India was
rendered so much more easy, that the demand
for its commodities began to increase far be-
yond what had been formerly known, if Eu-
rope had not been supplied with the gold and
silver which it was necessary to carry to the mar-
kets of the Eall from sources richer and more
abundant than her own barren and impoverished
mines, she uft either have abandoned the
trade with India altogether, or have continued
it with manifest disadvantage. By such a con-
tinual drain of gold and silver, as well as by
the unavoidable waste of both in circulation and
in manufacures, the quantity of those metals
must have gone on diminishing, and their value
would have been so much enhanced, that they
could not have continued long to be of the fame
utility in the commercial tranfations between
the two countries. But before the effects of
this diminution could be very sensibly felt,
America opened her mines, and poured in
treasures upon Europe in the molt copious
ltream to which mankind ever had access. This
treasure, in spite of innumerable anxious pre-
cautions to prevent it, flowed to the markets
where the commodities necessary for supplying
the wants, or gratifying the luxury of the Spa-
niards, were to be found; and from that time
to the present, the English and Dutch have pur-
chased the productions of China and Indostan,
with silver brought from the mines of Mexico
and Peru. The immense exportation of silver
to the East, during the course of two centuries,
has not only been replaced by the continual in-
flux from America, but the quantity of it has
been considerably augmented, and at the fame

time

57

S E C T time the proportional rate of its value in Eu.

Iv. rope and in India has varied so little, that it is,
v--J- chiefly with silver that many of the capital

articles imported from the East are still pur-
chased.

WHILa America contributed in this manner

to facilitate and extend the intercourse of Eu-
rope with Asia, it gave rife to a traffic with Afri-
ca, which, from ender beginnings, has be-
come so considerable, as to form the chief bond
of commercial conne&ion with that continent.
Soon after the Portuguese had xtended their
discoveries on the coast of Africa beyond the
river Senegal, they endeavoured to derive some
benefit from their new settlements there, by the
sale offlaves. Various circumstances combined
in favouring the revival of this odious traffic.
In every part of America, of which the Gpani-
ards took pofeffion, they found that the natives,
from the feebleness of their frame, from their
indolence, or from the injudicious manner of
treating them, were incapable of the exertions
requisite either for working mines, or for cul-
tivating the earth. Eager to find hands more
industrious and efficient, the Spaniards had re-
course to their neighbours the Portuguese, and
purchased from them negroe slaves. Experience
soon discovered, that they were men of a more
hardy race, and so much better fitted for en-
during fatigue, that the labour of one negroe
was computed to be equal to that of four Ame-
ricans ; and from that time the number em-
ployed in the New World has gone on increa-
sing, with rapid progress. In this pracice, no
less repugnant to the feelings of humanity, than
to the principles of religion, the Spaniards have
unhappily been imitated by all the nations of

" Hil. of America, vol. i. p. 320.

Europe,
,R

Europe, who have acquired territories in the s E c T.
warmer climates of the New World. At pre- IV.
sent the number of negroe slaves in the fettle- *
ments of Great Britain and France in the Weft
Indies, exceeds a million; and as the establish-
ment of servitude has been found, both in an-
cient and in modern times, extremely unfavour-
able to population, it requires an annual impor-
tation from Africa of at lear fifty-eight thou-
sand, to keep up the flock'. If it were poflible
to ascertain, with equal exaitnefs, the number
of slaves in the Spanilh dominions, and in North
America, the total number of negroe slaves
might be well reckoned at as many more.

THUS the commercial genius of Europe,

which has given it a visible ascendent over the
three other divisions of the earth, by discerning
their refpeEtive wants and resources, and by ren-
dering them reciprocally subservient to one ano-
ther, has established an union among them, from
which it has derived an immense increase of
opulence, of power, and of enjoyments.

VII. THOUGH the discovery of a New World

in the Weft, and the opening of a more easy
and dire& communication with the remote re.
gions of the Ears, co-operated towards extend-
ing the commerce, and adding to the enjoy-
ments, of Europe, a remarkable difference may
be observed, with refpe& both to time and the
manner in which they produced these effets.
When the Portuguese first visited the different
countries of Asia, firetching from the coast of
Malabar to China, they found them possessed by
nations highly civilized, which had made con-
fiderable progress in elegant as well as useful
arts, which were accustomed to intercourse with

159

S E C T. itrangers, and well acquainted with all the ad-

rv- vantages of commerce. But when the Spaniards
'~ began to explore the New World which they

discovered, the aspect which it presented to
them was very different. The islands were in-
habited by naked savages, so unacquainted with
the fim!eft and most necessary arts of life, that
thev fubfilted chiefly on the spontaneous pro-
ducions of a fertile foil and genial climate.
The continent appeared to be a forest of im-
mense extent, along the coall of which were
scattered some feeble tribes, not greatly fupe-
rior to the islanders in industry or improve.
ment. Even its two large monarchies, which
have been dignified with the appellation of ci-
vilized tfates, had not advanced so far beyond
their countrymen, as to be entitled to that
name. The inhabitants, both of Mexico and
Peru, unacquainted with the useful metals, and
destitute of the address requisite for acquiring
such command of the inferior animals as to de-
rive any aid from their labour, had made so lit-
tle progress in agriculture, the first of all arts,
that one of the greatest difficulties with which
the small number of Spaniards, who overturned
those empires which have been so highly ex-
tolled, had to Rruggle, was how to procure in
them what was sufficient for their subsistence.

IT was of consequence, with a very different

spirit, that the intercourse with two countries,
resembling each other so little in their degree of
improvement, was begun and carried on. The
Portuguese, certain of finding in the East, not
only the productions with which the bountiful
hand es Nature has enriched that part of the
globe, but various manufatures which had long
been known and admired in Europe, engaged
in this alluring trade with the greatest eagerness.
The encouragement of it their monarchs cdn-.

fidered

fidered as a chief objet of government, to- S E C T.
wards which they direced all the power of the IV.
kingdom, and rouzed their fubjets to such vi- ''
gorous exertions in the prosecution of it, as oc-
cafioned that astonishing rapidity of progress
which I have described. The sanguine hopes
with which the Spaniards entered upon their
career of discovery, met not with the fame
speedy gratification. From the industry of the
rude inhabitants of the New World, they did
not receive a single article of commerce. Even
the natural productions of the foil and climate,
when not cherished and multiplied by the softer-
ing and active hand of man, were of little ac-
count. Hope, rather than iuccefs, incited them
to persist in extending their researches and con-
quests; and as government derived little im-
mediate benefit from these, it left the profecu-
tion of them chiefly to private adventurers, by
whose enterprizing ativity, more than by any
effort of the state, the most valuable poffeflions
of Spain in America were acquired. Inflead of
the instantaneous and great advantages which
the Portuguese derived from their discoveries,
above half a century clapsed before the Spa-
niards reaped any benefit of consequence from
their conquests, except the small quantities of
gold which the islanders were compelled to
collec, and the plunder of the gold and silver
employed by the Mexicans and Peruvians as
ornaments of their persons and temples, or as
utensils of sacred or domestic use. It was .not
until the discovery of the mines of Potofi in
Peru,' in the year one thousand five hundred
and forty-five, and, of thole of Sacotecas in
Mllexico, soon aftei, that the Spanifi territo-
ries in the New World brought a pel ranent and
valuable addition of xs alth and rvcilu to the
mother country.

NOR

S EC T. NOR did the trade with India differ more

IV. from that ith America, in refpeca of the par-

ticular circunftance which I have explained,
than in respect to the manner of carrying it
on, after it grew to be a considerable objet of
political attention. Trade with the East was a
simple mercantile tranlaftion, confined to the
purchase either of the natural productions of
the country, such as spices, precious ltones,
pearls, &c. or of the manufacures which
abounded among an industrious race of men,
such as silk and cotton stuffs, porcelane, &c.
Nothing more was requisite in conduAing this
trade, than to fettle a few skilful agents in pro.
per places, to prepare a proper assortment of
goods for completing the cargoes of hips as
soon as they arrived from Europe, or at the
utmost to acquire the command of a few forti-
sied stations, which might secure them admif-
sion into ports where they might careen in
safety, and find protecion from the insults of
any hostile power. There was no neceflity of
making any attempt to eftablith colonies, either
for the cultivation of the foil, or the conduct
of manufactures. Both these remained, as
formerly, in the hands of the natives.

Bur as soon as that wild spirit of enterprize,

which animated the Spaniards who firit explored
and subdued the New World, began to subside,
and when, instead of roving as adventurers
from province to province in quest of gold and
fiier, they seriously turned their thoughts to.
wards rendering their conquests beneficial by
cultivation and industry, they found it necef.
farv to eftablith colonies in every country whic
they wiihed to improve. Other nations imi
tated their example in the settlements whicl
they afterwards made in some of the islands

ane

and on the continent of North America. S EC T.
Europe, after having desolated the New IV.
World, began to repeople it, and under a sys- ''
ter of colonization (the spirit and regulations
of which it is not the object of this Disquisition
to explain) the' European race has multiplied
there amazingly. Every article of commerce
imported from the New World, if we except
the furs and kins purchased from the inde-
pendent tribes of hunters in North America,
and from a few tribes in a similar Irate on the
Southern continent, is the produce of the in-
duftry of Europeans fettled there. To their
exertions, or to those of hands which they
have taught or compelled to labour, we are
indebted for rum, cotton, tobacco, indigo,
rice, and even the gold and ilver extracted
from the bowels of the eatth. Intent on tole
lucrative branches 'of induflry, the inhabitants
of the New World pay little attention to those
kinds of labour which occupy a considerable
part of the members of other ocieties, and de-
pend, in some measure, for their subsistence,
and entirely for every article of elegance and
luxury, upon the ancient continent. Thus the
Europeans have become manufacturers for
America, and their industry has been greatly
augmented by the vast demands for supplying
the wants of extensive countries, the population
of which is continually increasing. Nor is the
influence of this demand confined solely to the
nations which have a more immediate connection
with the American colonies; it is felt in every
part of Europe that furnithes any article ex-
ported to them, and gives great activity and
vigour to the hand of the artilan in the inland
provinces of Germany, as ell as to thole in
Great Britain and other countries, which carry
on a direc trade with the New World.

S E T. BUT while the discovery and conquest of

iv *America is allowed to be one principal cause

of that rapid increase of industry and wealth,
which is conspicuous in Europe during the two
last centuries, some timid theorists have main-
tained, that hroughout the fame period Europe
has been gradually impoverished, by being
drained of its tr-afure, in order to carry on its
trade with India. But this apprehension has
arisen from inattention to the nature and use
of the precious metals. They are to be confi-
dered in two different lights ; either as the signs
which all civilized nations have agreed to em-
ploy, in order to estimate or represent the va-
lue both of labour and of all commodities, and
thus to facilitate the purchase of the former,
and the conveyance of the latter from one pro-
prietor to another; or gold and silver may be
viewed as being themselves commodities or ar-
ticles of commerce, for which some equivalent
muff be given by such as wifi to acquire them.
In this light, the exportation of the precious
metals to the East should be regarded; for, as
the nation by which they are exported must
purchase them with the produce of their own
labour and ingenuity, this trade muff contri-
bute, though not in the fame obvious and di-
rect manner as that with America, towards
augmenting the general industry and oppulence
of Europe. If England, as the p ice of
Mexican and Peruvian dollars which are necef-
fary for carrying on its trade with India, must
give a certain quantity of its woollen or cotton
cloth or hard-ware, then the hands of an addi-
tional number of manufaturers are rendered
a&tive, and work to a certain amount mut be
executed, for which, without this trade, there

ould not have been any demand. The nation
reaps all the benefit arising from a new creation

of
14

of induftrv. With the gold and silver which S E
her manufacures have purchased in the W,\t, '
she is enabled to trade in the markets of the '-
East, and the exportation of treasure to Illia,
which has been so much dreaded, ipftcad of
impoverishing, enriches the kingdom.

VIII. Ir is to the discovery of the pafLTge to

India by the Cape of Good lIopg and to the
vigour and success with which the Portuguese
prosecuted their conquefls and established their
dominion there, that Europe has been indebted
for its preservation from the noft illiberal and
humiliating servitude that ever oppressed po.
lifhed nations. For this observation I am in-
debted to an Author whose ingenuity has il-
lustrated, and whose eloquence has adorned the
History of the Settlements and Commerce of
Modern Nations in the East and Weft Indies';
and it appears to me so well founded as to me-
rit more ample inveltigation. A few years after
the first appearance of the Portuguese in India,
the dominion of the Mameluks was overturned
by the irresistible power of the Turkish arms,
and Egypt and Syria were annexed as provinces
to their empire. If after this event the commer-
cial intercourse with India had continued to be
carried on in its ancient channels, the Turkish
Sultans, by being matiers of Egypt and Syria,
muff have pofleffed the absolute command of it,
whether the productons of the East were con.
veyed by the Red Sea to Alexandria, or were
transported by land-carriage from the Perflan
Gulf to Contantinople, and the ports of the
Mediterranean. The monarchs who were then
at the head of this great empire, were neither
destitute of abilities to perceive the pre-eni-

s - C T. nence to which this would have elevated them,

iv* nor of ambiiionto afpiretoit. Selim, the con.

queror of th Mameluks, by confirming the an-
cient privileges of the Venetians in Egypt and
,v'ri, and by his regulations concerning the du-
tics on Indian goods, which I have already men-
tioned, early discovered his solicitude to secure
ail the advantages of commerce with the East
to h own dominions. The attention of Soly-
man the Magnificent, his successor, seems to
have been equally directed towards the fame ob-
jec. More enlightened than any monarch of
the Ottoman race, he attended to all the tranf-
actions of the European states, and had observed
the power as well as opulence to which the re-
public of Venice had attained by engrossing the
commerce with the East. He now beheld Por-
tugal rising towards the fame elevation, by the
fame means. Eager to imitate and to supplant
them, he formed a scheme suitable to his cha-
rac&r for political wildoin and the appellation
of i/iituttsr of Rulcs, by which the Turkish
Historians have distinguished him, and efta.
blifhed, early in his reign, a system of commer-
cial laws in his dominions, by which he hoped

NOTE I. SECT. I. p. 6.
CREDULITY and scepticism are two oppo-

site extremes into which men are apt to

run, in examining the events which are said
to have happened in the early ages of antiquity.
Without incurring any fufpicicionof a propen-
fity to the latter of these, I may be allowed to
entertain doubts concerning the expedition of
Sefoftris into India, and his conquest of that
country.--. Few facts in ancient history
seem to be better etablifhed, than that of the
early aversion of the Egyptians to a sea-faring
life. Even the power of defpdtifm cannot at
once change the ideas and manners of a na-
tion, especially when they have been confirmed
by long habit, and rendered sacred by the
fantion of religion. That Sefoftris, in the
course of a few years, mhould have so entirely

over- I

overcome the prejudices of a superstitious peo-
ple, as to be able to fit out four hundred lhips.
of force in the Arabian Gulf, besides another
f.eet which he had in the Mediterranean, ap-
pears to be extremely improbable. Armaments
of such magnitude would require the utmost
eforts of a great and long established maritime
power.- 2. It is remarkable that Herodotus,
who enquired with the most persevering dili-
gence into the ancient history of Egypt, and
Iho received all the information concerning it
which the priests of Memphis, Heliopolis, and
Thebes, could communicate, Herodot. edit.
Weffelingij, lib. ii. c. 3. although he relates the
hiftorv of Sefoftris at some length, does not
mention his conquest of India. Lib. ii. c. 102,
&c. That tale, it is probable, was invented
in the period between the age of Herodotus and
that of Diodorus Siculus, from whom we re-
ceive a particular detail of the Indian expedition
,f Sefoftris. His account refts entirely upon
the authority of the Egyptian priests; and Di-
odorus himself not only gives it as his general
opinion. " that many things which they related,
' flowed rather from a desire to promote the
" honour of their country, than from attention
" to truth," lib. i. p. 34. edit, Weffelingij,
Amit. 1746; but takes particular notice that
the Egyptian priests, as well as the Greek wri-
ters, differ widely from one another in the ac-
counts which they give of the actions of Sefo-
Itris, lib. i. p. 62.--3. Though Diodorus as-
fert., that in relating the history of Sefoftris,
he had fudied to fele& what appeared to him
:::nt probahle, and most agreeable to the mo-
.-'me::t of that monarch frill remaining in
LvYpt. he has admitted into his narrative many
rr.'--e,! s circum.iances which render the
* toiLc .xtrmne!v fulpicicus. The father of Se-

fof.ris,

foftris, as he relates, collected all the male
children who were born in Egypt on the fame
day with his son, in order that they might be
educated, together with him, conformable to
a mode which he prescribed, with a view of pre-
paring them as proper instruments to carry into
execution the great undertakings for which he
destined Sefoftris. Accordingly, when Sefo-
firis et out upon his Indian expedition, which,
from circumstances mentioned by Diodorus,
mufft have been about the fortieth year of his
age, one thousand seven hundred of his youthful
associates are said to have been still alive, and
were entrusted with high command in his army.
But if we apply to the examination of this
itory the certain principles of political arith-
metic, it is evident, that if one thousand seven
hundred of the male children born on the fame
day with Sefofiris were alive when this great ex-
pedition commenced, the number of children
born in Egypt on each day of the year muff
have been at least ten thousand, and the popu-
lation of the kingdom mutt have exceeded sixty
millions; Goguet l'Origine des Loix, desArts,
&c. tom. ii. p. 12, &c. a number far beyond
the bounds of credibility, in a kingdom which,
from the accurate calculations of M. D'Anville,
Memoire fur l'Egypte Anc. et Moderne, p. 23,
&c. does not contain more than two thousand
one hundred square leagues of habitable coun-
try. Another marvellous particular is the de-
scription of a ship of cedar, four hundred and
ninety feet in length, covered on the outside
with gold, and on the inside with silver, which
Sefofris consecrated to the deity who was the
chief objet of *:orfhip at Thebes. Lib. i. p.
67. Such too is the account he gives of the
Egyptian army, in which, betide fix hundred
thousand infantry, and twenty-four thoui'ur i

cavalry, there were twenty-feven thousand armed
chariots. Ibid. p. 64.- 4. These and other
particulars appeared so far to exceed the bounds
of probability, that the found understanding of
Strabo the geographer reje&ed, without hefita-
tion, the accounts of the Indian expedition of
Sefoftris; and he not only afierts, in the molt
explicit terms, that this monarch never entered
India, lib. xv. p. oo7. C. edit. Cafaub. Amft.

there was little intercourse between Egypt and
India.

WHEN we confider the extent and effets of

the Phenician commerce, the scanty information
concerning it which we receive from ancient
writers must, on a first view, appear surprising.
But when we recolled that all the Greek Hifto-
rians (Herodotus excepted), who give any ac-
count of the Phenicians, published their works
long after the deftrudion of Tyre by Alexander
the Great, we hall cease to wonder at their not
having entered into minute details with refpec
to a trade which was then removed to new feats,

and
;74

and carried on in other channels. But the
power and opulence of Tyre, in the prosperous
age of its commerce, must have attraced ge-
neral attention. In the prophesies of Ezekiel,
who flourished two hundred and sixty years be.
fore the fall of Tyre, there is the most particu-
lar account of the nature and variety of its
commercial tranfations that is to be found in
any ancient writer, and which conveys, at the
fame time, a magnificent idea of the extensive
power of that state. Ch. xxvi, xxvii, xxviii.

NOTE III. SECT. I. p. 11.

THE account given of the revenue of the

Persian monarchy by Herodotus is curious, and
seems to have been copied from some public re-
cord, which had been communicated to him.
According to it, the Persian empire was divided
into twenty Satrapy's, or governments. The
tribute levied from each is specified, amounting
in all to 14,560 Eubaean talents, which Dr.
Arbuthnot reckons to be equal to 2,807,4371.
sterling money; a fum extremely small for the
revenue of the Great King, and which ill ac-
cords with many fats concerning the riches,
magnificence, and luxury of the East, that oc-
cur in ancient authors.

IT is surprising that Alexander did not re-

ceive, in the provinces contiguous to India, such
an account of the periodical rains in that coun-
try, as to hew him the impropriety of carry-
ing on military operations there, whitl these
continued. His expedition into India com-

menced

menced towards the end of Spring, Arrian, lib.
iv. c. 22, when the rains were already begun in
the mountains from which all the rivers in the
Panjab flow, and of course they mutl have been
considerably swelled before he arrived on their
banks. Rennell, p. 268.-He passed the Hy-
dafpes at Midsummer, about the height of the
rainy season. In a country through which so
many large rivers run, an army on service at
this time of the year must have suffered greatly.
An accurate description of the nature of the
rains and inundations in this part of India, is
given by Arrian, lib. v. c. 9.; and one still
fuller may be found in Strabo, lib. xv. 1013.-
It was of what they suffered by these that Alex-
ander's soldiers complained, Strabo, lib. xv.
oz02. D.; and not without reason, as it had
rained inctffantly during seventy days, Diod.
Sicul. xvii. c. 94-A circumstance which marks
the accuracy with which Alexander's officers had
attended to every thing in that part of India,
deserves notice. Ariftobulus, in his Journal,
which I have mentioned, takes notice that,
though heavy rains fell in the mountains, and
in the country near to them, in the plains be-
low not so much as a shower fell. Strabo, lib.
xv. ioi3. B. o1015 . . Major Kennell was in-
formed by a perlbn of character, who had re-
fided in this diflric of India, whlch is now fel-

nity of the feat of his government to India,
had the means of being well informed concern-
ing the nature of the country, avoided the error
of Alexander, and made his Indian campaign
during the dry season. As Nadir Shah, both
when he invaded India, A. D. 1738, and in his
return next year, marched through the fame
countries with Alexander, and nearly in the
lame line of direction, nothing can give a more
triking idea of the persevering ardour of the
Macedonian conqueror, than the description of
the difficulties which Nadir Shah had to iur.
mount, and the hardships which his army en-
dured. Though pofleffed of absolute power
and immense wealth, and distinguished no less
by great talents than long experience in the
conduct of war, he had the mortification to lose
a great part of his troops in crossing the rivers of
the Panjab, in penetrating through the moun-
tains to the north of India, and in conflicts with
the fierce natives inhabiting the countries which
firetch from the banks of the Oxus to the fron-
tiers of Persia. An interesting account of his
retreat and sufferings is given in the Memoirs
of Khojeh Abdulkurreem, a Cafhmerian of dif
tinction, who served in his army.

NOTE V. SECT. I. p. 17.

THAT a fleet so numerous hould have been

colleted in such a short time, is apt to appear,
at firfit fight, incredible. Arrian, however, as-
fures us, that in specifying this number, he fol-
lowed Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, whose autho-
rity he confidered to be of the greatest weight,
lib. vi. c. 3. But as the Panjab country is full
of navigable rivers, on which all the intercourse

N among

177

among the natives was carried on, it abounded
with vessels ready conffruted to the conqueror's
hands, so that he might easily collea that num-
ber. If we could give credit to the account of
the invasion of India by Semiramis, no fewer
than four thousand vessels were assembled in the
Indus to oppose her fleet. Diod. Sicul. lib. ii.
c. 74.-1t is remarkable that when Mahmoud
of Gaznah invaded India, a fleet was collected
on the Indus to oppose him, consisting of the
fame number of vessels. We learn from the
Aveen A'L- bry, that the inhabitants of this part
of India iiill continue to carry on all their com-
munic ai n with each other by water the in.
habitants of the Circar of Tatta alone have no
less than forty thousand vessels of various con-
ftrucuons. 'Vol. ii. p. 143.

NOTE VI. SECT. I. p. 18.

ALL these particulars are taken from the In-

dian Hiilory of Arrian, a work different from
that already mentioned, and one of the most
curious treatises tranfmnitted to us from anti-
quity. The firfl part of it conifts of extracts
from the account given by Nearchus of the cli-
mate and foil of India, and the manners of the
natives. The second contains that officer's
journal of !;i voyage from the mouth of the
Indus to tle bottom of the Persian Gulf. The
perusal of i gives rife to several observations.
--- . I: is renmrkable that neither Nearchus
nor Ptolemy, nor Ariifobulus, nor even Arrian,
once mention the voyage of Scylax. This
could not proceed from their being unacquaint-
ed with it, for Herodotus was a favourite au-
thor in the hands of every Greek who had any
pretensions to literature. It was probably oc-

cafioned
i'7

cafioned by the reasons which they had to dif-
trust the veracity of Scylax, of which I have
already taken notice. Accordingly, in a speech
which Arrian puts into the mouth of Alexan-
der, he asserts that, except Bacchus, he was
the first who had pased the Indtls; which im
plies, that he disbelieved what is related con-
cerning Scylax, and was not acquainted with
what Darius Hyftafpes is said to have done in
order to fubje& that part of India to the Persian
crown. Arrian, vii. c. o. This opinion is
confirmed by legafthenes, who resided a con-
fiderable time in India. He asserts that, except
Bacchus and Hercules, (to whose fabulous ex-
peditions Strabo is aftonilhed that he should
have given any credit, lib. xv. p. 100oo7. D.)
Alexander was the firflt vho had invaded India;
Arrian, Hist. Indic. c. 5. We are informed by
Arrian, that the Aflacani, and other people
who possessed that country, which is now called
the kingdom of Car.dahar, paid tribute, first
to the Assyrians, and afterwards to the Medes
andPerfians; Hist. Indic. c. r. As all the ser-
tile provinces on the north-west of the Indus
were accidentally reckoned to be part of India,
it is probable that what was levied from them is
the fum mentioned in the tribute-roll, from
which Herodoys drew his account of the an-
nual revenue of the Persian empire, and thy$
none of the provinces to the south of theIndus
were ever liuject to the kings of Persia.--2.
This voyage of Nearchus affords Ibine triking
instances of the imperfet knowledge which the
ancients had of any navigation different from
that to which they were accustomed in the Me-
diterranean. Though the enterprising genius
and enlarged views of Alexander prompted him
to attempt opening an intercourse by sea be-
tween India and his Persian dominions, yet both

N2 he

he and Nearchus knew so little of the ocean
vhich they wished to explore, as to be appre-
hcnfive that it might be found impossible to na-
vzate it, on account of impervious traits, or
cther cbftacles. Hilt. Indic. c. 20. Q Curt.
iib. ix. c. 9. When the fleet arrived near tle
mouth of the Indus, the astonishment excited
LI' the extraordinary flow and ebb of tide in
the Indian ocean, a phenomenon (according to
Arrian) with which Alexander and his soldiers
were unacquainted, lib. vi. c. 19. is another
proof of their ignorance in maritime science.
;Ncr is there any rafon to be surprised at their
a;tci;i:;n;en, as the tides are hardly perceptible
i:n the Mediterranean, beyond which the know-
ledge of the Greeks and Macedonians did not
ex:end. For the fame reason, when the Ro-
mans carried their vicorious arms into the
countries situated on the Atlantic Ocean, or on
the seas that communicate with it, this new phe-
nomenon of the tides was an obje& of wonder
and terror to them. Cafar describes the a-
inazement of his soldiers at a spring-tide, which
greatly damaged the fleet with which he invaded
Britain, and acknowledges that it was an ap-
pearance with which they were unacquainted;
Bell. Gallic. lib. iv. c. 29. The tides on the
roast near the mouth of the Indus are remarka-
i' hi .h, and the effecs of them very great,
efpecialiv that sudden and abrupt influx of the
tide into the rouths of rivers o narrow traits
wlic'h; is known in India by the name of The
E.r-, and is accurately described by Major
Rcr.nc', Introd. xxiv. Mem. 278. In thePe-
ripius Maris Lrythraei, p. 26. these high tides
rec mrentioned, and the description of them
nearly resembles that of the Bore. A very ex-
aggerated account of the tides in the Indian
ocean is given by Plinvy Nat. Hist. lib. xiii. c. 25.

Major

Major Rennel! seems to think, that Alexanller
and his followers could not be so entirelv unac-
quainted with the phenomenon of the tidts, as
Herodotus had informed the Greeks, " that in
" the red sea there was a regular ebb and How
" of the tide every day ;" lib. ii. c. 1 . This
is all the explanation of that phenomenon given
by Herodotus. But among the ancients there
occur instances of inattention to facts, related
by refpeaable authors, which appear fuiprifing
in modern times. Though Herodotus, as 1
have just now observed, gave an account o the
voyage performed by Scylax at considerable
length, neither Alexander, nor his Historians,
take any notice of that event. I shall after-
wards have occasion to mention a more remar-
kable instance of the inattention of later writers
to an accurate defeription which Ilerodotus had
given of the Caspian Sea. From there, and
other similar inltances which migtht have been
produced, we may conclude, that the flight men.
tion of the regular flow and ebb of tide in the
Red Sea, is not a sufficient reason for rejecing,
as incredible, Arrian's account of the surprise
of Alexander's soldiers when they first beheld
the extraordinary effects of the tide at ;he mnouth
of the Indus.- -3. The course of Nearchus's
voyage, the promontories, the creeks, the iv-
ers, the cities, the mountains, which came fuc-
ceffively in his view, are so clearly described, and
the distances of such as were worthy of notice
are so dillindly marked, that M D'Anville, by
comparing there with the actual position of the
country, according to the best accounits of it,
ancient as well as modern, has I:e.n able to
point out molt of the places which Nearch:s
mentions, with a degree of certainty x:hich
does as much honour to the veracity ot the Gre-
cian navigator, as to the industry, learning,

and

and penetration of the French geographer.

iN modern timea, the Red Sea is a name ap-

ppr.riatcd to the Arabian Gulf, but the anci-
clits denominared the ocean which stretches
from that Gulf to India, the ErythreanSea,
from king Ervthras, of whom nothing more is
known than the na:re, which in the (;reek lan-
g.;ae fignires red. From this carual meaning
of the word, it came to be believed, that it was
of a different colour from other seas, and con-
ftquently of more dangerous navigation.

ALEXANDER was so intent on rendering this

union of his fubjeats complete, that after his
death there was found in his tablets or commen-
taries, (among other tragnificent fcheples which
he meditated) a resolution to build several new
cities, some in Afa, and some in Europe, and
to people thole in Alia with Europeans, and

superintended the building of both. But it is
evident, from Arrian, lib. v. c. ult, that he
built a third city on the Acefines, now the Je-
naub, under the direction of HephasLtion; and
if it was his object to retain the command of
the country, a place of strength on ome of the
rivers to the south of the Hydafpes seems to have
been necessary for that purpose. This part of
India has been so little visited in modern times,
that it is impossible to point out with precision
the situation of these cities. If P Tieffenthaler
were well founded on his conjecure, that the
river now called Rauvee is the Acefines of Ar-
rian, Bernouilli, vol. i. p. 39., it is probable
that this city was built somewhere near Lahore,
one of the most important stations in that part
of India, and reckoned in the Aycen Akbery to
be a city of very high antiquity. But Major
Rennell, in my opinion, gives good reasons for
supposing the Jenaub to be the Acefines of the
ancients.

NOTE IX. SECT. I. p. 25.

THE religious scruples which prevented the

Persians from making any voyage by sea, were
known to the ancients. Pliny relates of one of
the Magi, who was sent on an embafly from
Tiridates to the emperor Nero, " Navigare no.
" luerat, quoniam exfpuere in Maria, alijfque
" mortalium neceffitatibus violare naturam earn,
1" fas non putant;" Nat. Hit. lib. xxx. c. 2.
This aversion to the sea they carried so far, that,
according to the observation of a well-informed
Historian, there was not a city of any note in
their empire built upon the sea.coast ; Ammian,
Marcel. lib. xxiii. c. 6. We learn from Dr,
Hyde, how intimately these ideas were con-

neted

183

necled with the doctrines of Zoroaster; Rel.
Vet. Perf. cap. vi. In all the wars of the Per-
sians with Greece, the fleets of the Great King
confilted entirely of ships furnihed by the Phe-
nicians, Syrians, the conquered provinces of
the Lesser Asia, and the islands adjacent. Hero-
dotus and Diodorus Siculus mention the. quota
furnithed by each country, in order to compose
the fleet of twelve hundred hips with which
Xerxes invaded Greece, and among these there
is not one belonging to Persia. At the fame time
it is proper to observe, that according to Hero-
dotus, whose authority is unquestionable with
regard to this point, the fleet was under the
command of Ariabigines, a son of Darius, who
had several satraps of high rank under his com-
mand, and both Persians and Medes served as
soldiers on board of'it; Herod. lib. vii. c. 96,
97. By what motives, or what authority, they
were induced to a in this manner, I cannot
explain. From some religious scruples, similar
tr those of the Persians, many of the natives
cf Indoflan, in our own time, refuse to em-
bark on board a hip, and to serve at sea; and
vet, on iome occasions, the fepoys in the ser-
vice of the European powers have got the bet-
ter of these scruples.

cities, or, what may be confidered as the fame,
the establishment of fortified stations, was the
mode of maintaining their authority in the con-
quered nations, adopted not only by Alexander,
but by his successors. Seleucus andAntiochus,
to whom the greater part of the Persian em-
pire became subjed, were no less remarkable
for founding new cities than Alexander, and
these cities seem fully to have answered the pur-
poses of the founders, as they effetually pre-
vented (as I hall afterwards have occasion to
observe) the revolt of the conquered provinces.
Though the Greeks, animated with the love of
liberty and of their native country, rfufed to
fettle in the Persian empire while under the do-
minion of its native monarchs, even when al-
lured by the profpet of great advantage, as M.
de Sainte-Croix remarks, the cafe became per-
fedly different, when that empire was fubjeded
to their own dominion, and they fettled there,
not as fubjeas, but as masters. Both Alexan-
der and his successors discovered much discern-
ment in chufing the situation of the cities which
they built. Seleucia, which Seleucus founded,
was inferior only to Alexandria in number of
inhabitants, in wealth, and in importance; Mr.
Gibbon, vol. i. p. 250. M. D'Anville, Mem.
de Literat. xxx.

IT is from Julin we receive the slender know-

ledge we have of the progress which Seleucus
made in India; lib. xv. c. 4. But we cannot
rely on his evidence, unless when it is confirmed
by the testimony of other authors. Plutarch
seems to assert, that Seleucus had penetrated far
into India; but that refpcetable writer is more

eminent

eminent for his discernment of characers, and
hiE happv selection of those circumstances which
mark and discriminate them, than for the accu.
racy of his hiltorical researches. Pliny, whose
authority is of greater weight, seems to confider
it as certain, that Seleucus had carried his arms
into diftrics of India which Alexander never
vificed; Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. vi. c. 17. The
passage in which this is mentioned, is some-
what obscure, but it seems to imply, that Se-
leucus had marched from the Hyphafis to the
Hyfudrus, from thence to Palibothra, and from
that to the mouth of the Ganges. The diftan.
ces of the principal tfations in this march are
marked, amounting to 2244 Roman miles. In
this sense, M. Bayer understands the words of
Pliny; Hiftor. Regni Graecorum Bacriani, p.
37. But to me it appears highly improbable,
that the Indian expedition of Seleucus could
have continued so long as to allow time for ope-
rations of such extent. If Seleucus had ad-
anced as far into India as the mouth of the
Ganges, the ancients would have had a more
accurate knowledge of that part of the country
than they seem ever to have possessed.

IN fixing the position of Palibothra, I have

ventured to differ from Major Rennell, and I
venture to do so with diffidence. According to
Strabo, Palibothra was situated at the juntion
of the Ganges and another river; lib. xv. p.
1028. A. Arrian is still more explicit. He
places Paibothra at the confluence of the Gan-
ges and Erranaboas, the las of which he de-
fcribcs as less than the Ganges or Indus, but
greater than any other known river; Hilt. Ind.
c. o. 'lhis description of its situation corref-
ponds exa&ly with that of Allahabad. P. Bou.
dier, to whose observations the geography of
India is much indebted, fays, that the Jumna,
as its junction with the Ganges, appeared to him
not inferior in magnitude to that river; D'An-
ville, Antiq. de 1' Inde, p. 53. Allahabad is
the name which was given to that city by the
emperor Akbar, who ereced a strong fortress
there; an elegant delineation of which is pub-
lifhed by Mr. Hodges, No. IV. of his Selet
Views in India. Its ancient name, by which it
is till known among the Hindoos, is Prieg, or
Piyag, and the people of the diftric are called
Praegi, which bears a near resemblance to Prafij,
the ancient appellation of the kingdom of which
Palibothra was the capital; P. Tieffenthaler
chez Bernouilli, tom. i. 223, D'Anville, p. 56.
Allahabad is such a noted feat of Hindoo devo-
tion, that it is denominated The King of' IVr-
Jhipped Places; Ayeen Akbery, vol. ii. p. 3
"The territory around it, to the extent of forty
"miles, is deemed holy ground. The Hin-
" doos believe, that when a man dies in this
' place, whatever he wiflles for he will obtain
"in his next regeneration. Although they

" teach

" teach that suicide in general will be puniflied

with torments hereafter, vet they confider it

" as meritorious for a man to kill himself at
" Alahabad ;" Ayeen Akbery, iii. 256. P.
Tieftnrthaler describes the various objets of ve-
neration at AlPahabad, which are Itill visited
with great devotion by an immense number of
pilgrim; ; Bernouilli, tom. i. 224. From all
thee circumitances, we may conclude it to be
a place of great antiquity, and in the fame fitua.
tion with the Palibotbra of antiquity.

MAJOR RN.EL has been induced to place

Palibothra on the fame site with Patna, chiefly
by two confiderations.-i. From having
learned that on or near the site of Patna flood
anciently a very large city named Patelpoot-ber
or Patalipputra, which nearly resembles the an-
cient name of Palibothra. Although there is
not now a confluence of two rivers at Patna, he
vwas informed that the junc&ion of the Soane
wi:h the Ganges, now twenty-two miles above
Patna, was formerly under the walls of that
citv. The rivers of India sometimes change
thir curse in a singular manner, and he pro-
duces some remarkable instances of it. But
tvcn ficuld it be allowed, that the accounts
x hich he natives give of this variation in the
coure of the Soane were perfectly accurate, I
queslicn 'hether 'rrian's account of the mag-
nitude of the Erranaboas be applicable to that
river, certair.l not so juftlv as to the Jumna.
--2. lie fc-rial to have been influenced, in
some dtree, by Piiny's Itinerary, or Table of
Di£:ances hio:: iaxiia (the modern Attock) to
:he mcn:h of :e- Ganges; Nat. Hilt. lib. vi.
c. X1. Bu th' dif'ances in that Itinerary are
inarkedt o inaccurately, and in some instances
are fC pailabl? erroneous, that one cannot found

upon

upon them with much security. According to
it, Palibothra is situated four hundred and
twenty-five miles below the confluence of the
Jumnaand Ganges. The acual diitance, how-
ever, between Allahabad and Patna, is not more
than two hundred British miles. A disagree-
ment so considerable cannot be accounted for,
without supposing some extraordinary error in
the Itinerary, or that the point of conflux of
the Jumna with the Ganges has undergone a
change. For the former of these suppositions
there is no authority (as far as I know) from any
manuscript, or for the latter from any tradition.
Major Rennell has produced the reasons which
led him to suppose the site of Palibothra to be
the fame with that of Patna; Memoirs, p. 49-
54. Some of the objetions which might be
made to this supposition he has foreseen, and en-
deavoured to obviate; and after all that I have
added to them, I ihall not be surprised, if, in a
geographical discussion, my readers are disposed
to prefer his decision to mine.

A FACT cursorily related by Strabo, and

which has escaped the inquisitive industry of
M. de Guignes, coincides remarkably with the
narrative of the Chinese writers, and confirms
it. The Greeks, he fays, were deprived of
Eacaria by tribes or hordes of Scythian No-
mades, who came from the country beyond the
Jaartes, and are known by the names of Afij,
Paliani, Tachari, and Sacarauli; Strab. lib. xi.

As the distance of Arfinoe, the modern Su-

ez, from the Nile, is considerably less than that
between Berenice and Coptos, it was by this
route that all the commodities imported into the
Arabian Gulf,'might have been conveyed with
most expedition and less expence into Egypt.
But the navigation of the Arabian Gulf, which
even in the present improved state of nautical
science is flow and difficult, was in ancient times
confidered by the nations around it to be so ex-
tremely perilous, that it led them to give such
r.names to several of its promontories, bays, and
harbours, as convey a striking idea of the im-
prceion which the dread of this danger had
made upon their imagination. 'Ihe entry into
the Gulf they called Bal'emanadeb, the gate or
port of affli&ion. To a harbour not far dif-
tant, they gave the name of Mcte, i. e. Death.
A head land adjacent they called Gardefan, the

Cape
193

Cape of Burial. Other denominations of fimi-
lar import are mentioned by the author to whom
I am indebted for this information. Bruce's
Travels, vol. i. p. 442, &c. It is not surprising
then, that the staple of Indian trade ihould have
been transferred from the northern extremity
of the Arabian Gulf to Berenice, as by this
change a dangerous navigation was greatly
shortened. This seems to have been the chief
reason that induced Ptolemy to eflablifh the port
of communication with India at Berenice, as
there were other harbours on the Arabian Gulf
which were considerably nearer than it to the
Nile. At a later period, after the ruin of Cop-
tos by the Emperor )iocletian, we are informed
by Abulfeda, Defcript. Egypt. edit. Michaelis,
p. 77, that Indian commodities were conveyed
from the Red Sea to the Nile, by the horteft
route, viz. from Coffeir, probably the Philoteras
Portus of Ptolemy, to Cous, the Vicus Apollinis,
a journey of four days. The fame account of
the distance was given by the natives to Dr. Po-
cocke, Travels, vol. i. p. 87. In consequence
of this, Cous, from a small village, became the
city in upper Egypt next n magnitude to So-
flat, or Old Cairo. In process of time, from
causes which I cannot explain, the trade from
the Red Sea by Coffeir removed to Kene, far-
ther down the river than Cous, Abulf. p. 13.
77. D'Anville Egypte, 196-200. In modern
times, all the commodities of India imported
into Egypt, are either brought by sea fromGidda
to Suez, and thence carried on camels to Cairo,
or are conveyed by land-carriage by the cara-
van-returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca,

188, &c. This, as far as I have been able to
trace it, is a complete account of all the differ-
ent routes by which the productions of the East

iX~~ ~have

have been conveyed to the Nile, from the first
opening of that communication. It is singular
that P. Sicard, Mrem. des Missions dans le Le-
vant, tom. ii. p. 157, and some other refpea-
ble writers, (hould suppose Coffeir to be the
Berenice founded byPtolemy, although Ptolemy
has laid down its latitude at 23° 50', and Strabo
has described it as nearly under the fame paral-
lel with that of Syene, lib. ii. p. Iog, D. In
consequence of this mistake, Pliny's computa-
tion of the distance between Berenice and Cop-
tos, at two hundred and fifty-eight miles, has
been deemed erroneous. Pococke, p. 87. But
as Pliny not only mentions the total distance,
but names the different fations in the journey,
and specifies the number of miles between each;
and as the Itinerary of Antoninus coincides ex-
acly with his account, D'Anville Egypte, p.
21, there is no reason to call in quefftion the ac-
curacy of it.

MAJOR RENNEL is of opinion " that under

the Ptolemies, the Egyptians extended their na-
vigation to the extreme point of the Indian con-
tinent, and even failed up the Ganges to Pa-
libothra," now Patna, Introd. p. xxxvi. But
had it been usual to fail up the Ganges as high
as Patna, the interior parts of India must have
been better known to the ancients than they ever
were, and they would not have continued to de-
rive their information concerning them from
Megafthenes alone. Strabo begins his defcrip-
tion of India in a very remarkable manner.
He requests his readers to peruse with indul-
gence the account which he gives of it, as it
was a country very remote, and few persons had

visited
I92

visited it; and of these, many having seen only
a small part of the country, related things either
from hear-say, or, at the belt, what they had
hastily remarked while they passed through it in
the course of military service, or on a journey.
Strabo, lib. xv. p. oS5. B. He takes notice
that few of the traders from the Arabian Gulf
ever reached the Ganges. Ibid. oo6. C. He
asserts, that the Ganges enters the sea by one
mouth, ibid. toio. C.; an error into which
he could not have fallen if the navigation of
that river had been common in his time. He
mentions indeed the failing up the Ganges, ibid.
iolo, but it is cursorily in a single sentence;
whereas, if such a considerable inland voyage
of above four hundred miles, through a popu-
lous and rich country, had been customary, or
even if it had ever been performed by the Ro-
man, or Greek, or Egyptian traders, it must
have merited a particular description, and must
have been mentioned by Pliny and other
writers, as there was nothing similar to it in
the pracice of navigation among the ancients.
It is observed by Arrian (or whoever is the au-
thor of the Periplus Maris Erythraei), that pre-
vious to the discovery of a new route to India,
which shall be mentioned afterwards, the com-
merce with that country was carried on in finall
vessels which failed round every bay, p. 32. Ap.
Hudf. Geogr. Min. Vessels of such light con-
ftrution, and which followed this mode of fail-
ing, were ill fitted for a voyage so distant as
that round Cape Comorin, and up the Bay of
Bengal, to Patna. It is not improbable, that
the merchants whom Strabo mentions as having
reached the Ganges, may have travelled thither
by land, either from the countries towards the
mouth of the Indus, or from some part of the
Malabar coast, and that the navigation up the

0 ,Ganges,

193

Ganze3, of which he casually takes notice, was
performed by the natives in vessels of the coun.
try. This opinion derives some confirmation
fron his remarks upon the bad structure of the
v Te'- hich frequented that part of the Indian

THE erroneous ideas of many intelligent

writers of antiquity with refped to the Caspian
Sea, though well known to every man of let-
ters, are f remarkable, and afford such a ftrik-
ing example of the imperfection of their geo-
graphical knowledge, that a more full account
of them may not only be acceptable to some of
my readers, but in endeavouring to trace the
various routes by which the commodities of the
East were conveyed to the nations of Europe,
it becomes neceffarv to enter into some detail
concerning their various sentiments with refpett
to this matter. I. According to Strabo, the
Caspian i a bay, that communicates with the
great Northern ocean, from which it iilues at
fir:, b a narrow ftrair, and thcn expands into
the eia extending in breadth five hundred ita-
dia, lib. xi. p. 772- . W ith him Pomponius
Mela agrees, and dc'cries the straight by which
the Caspian is connected with the ocean, as of
considerable length, aind so narrow that it had
the appearance of a river, lib. iii. c. 5. edit.
Pliny likewise gives a imilar description of it,
Nat. Hilt. iib. vi. c. 15. In the age of Justinian,
this opinion concrning the communication of
the Caspian Sea with the ocean, was till preva-
lent; Cofm. Indicopl Topog. Christ. lib. ii.

p. 138.
194

p. T3 C. . . Some early writers, bya miilake
still more singular, have supposed the Caspian
Sea to be connected with the Euxine. Quints
Curtius, whose ignorance of geography is noto-
rious, has adopted this errror, lib. vii. c. 7. edit.
3. Arrian, though a much more judicious
writer, and who by residing for some time in
the Roman province of Cappadocia, of which
he was governor, might have obtained more ac-
curate information, declares in one place, the
origin of the Caspian Sea to be frill unknown,
and is doubtful whether it was conneced with
the Euxine, or with the great Ealtern ocean
which surrounds India; lib. vii. c. 16. In ano-
ther place he asserts, that there was a commu-
nication between the Caspian and the Eastern
ocean ; lib. v. c. 26. These errors appear more
extraordinary, as a just description had been
given of the Calpian by Herodotus, near five
hundred years before the age of Strabo. " The
Caspian, fays he, is asea by itself, unconnected
with any other. Its length is as much as a vef-
fel with oars can fail in fitfeen days, its greatefl
breadth as much as it can fail in eight days ;"
lib. i. c. 203. Aristotle describes it in the fame
manner, and with his usual precision contends
that it ought to be called a great lake, not a
sea; Meteorolog. lib. ii. Diodorus Siculus con-
curs with them in opinion, vol. ii. li). xviii. p.
261. None of thole authors determine whe-
ther the greatest length of the Caspian was from
North to South, or rom Ealt to Weft. In the
ancient maps which illuitrate the geography of
Ptole.ny, it is delineated, as if its greatelt length
extenlked fromn Laat to \Wfit. In modern times
the firt informaion concerning the true form
of the Calpian which the people of iurope re-
ceived, was given by Anthony Jenkinfon, an
Englifll merchant, who with a caravan from

Cafpaii is iuuconnedtd with any other sea, but
that its length from North to South is confide-
rab!. '-.re than its greareft breadth from East
to Weft. From this detail, however, we learn
how the ili-founJed ideas concerning it, which
were generally adopted, gave rife to various
wxild fchems of conveying Indian commodities
to Europe by means of its supposed communi-
caion with the Euxine sea, or with the Northern
ocean. It is an additional proof of the atten-
tion of Alexander the Great to every thing
conducive to the improvement of commerce,
t;hat a short time before his death he gave direc-
tions to fit out a squadron in the Caspian, in
order to furvev that sea, and to discover whe-
ther it was connected either with the Euxine or
Indian ocean; Arrian, lib. vii. c. 16.

NOTE XIX. SECT. I. p. 47.

FRC'. this curious detail, we learn how im-

perfect ancient navigation ws, even in its moll
improved state. The voyage fom Berenice to
Ocelis, could not have taken thirty days, if any
other ccurfe had been held than that of servilely
following the windings of the coast. The voy-
age from Ocelis to Mufiris would be (according
to Major Rennell) fifteen days run for an Eu-
ropean ftip in the modern !ile of navigation,
being about seventeen hundred and fifty marine
miles, on a ftreight course; Introd. p. xxxvii.
It iL remarkable, that though the Periplus Maris

Erythraei
i;

Erythrei was written after the voyage of Hippa.
lus, the chief objec of the author of it is to
describe the ancient course along the coasts of
Arabia and Persia, to the mouth of the Indus,
and from thence down the western shore of the
continent to Mufiris. I can account for
this, only by supposing, that from the unwil-
lingnefs of mankind to abandon old habits, the
greater part of the traders from Berenice still
continued to follow that route to which they
were accustomed. To go from Alexandria to
Mufiris, required (according to Pliny) ninety-
four days. In the year 17S8, the Boddam, a
ship belonging to the English laft-India Com-
pany, of a thousand tons burthen, took only
fourteen days more to complete her voyage from
Portsmouth to Madras. Such are the improve-
ments which have been made in navigation.

IT was the opinion of Plato, that in a well-

regulated commonwealth, the citizens flould
not engage in commerce, nor the Rfate aim at
obtaining maritime power. Commerce, he
contends, would corrupt the purity of their mo-
rals, and by entering into the sea service, they
would be accustomed to find pretexts for jufti-
fying conduc so inconsistent with what was
manly and becoming, as would gradually relax
the strictness of military discipline. It had been
better for the Athenians, he asserts, to have con-
tinued to fend annually the sons of seven of
their principal citizens to be devoured by the
Minotaur, than to have changed their ancient
manners, and to have become a maritime power.
In that perfect republic, of which he delineates
the form, he ordains that the capital lhould be

PLINY has devoted two entire books of his

Natural History, lib. xii. and xiii. to the enu-
meration and description of the spices, aroma-
tics, ointments, and perfumes, the use of which
luxury had introduced among his countrymen.
As many of these were the producions of In-
dia, or of the countries beyond it, and as the
trade with the East was carried on to a great
extent in the age of Pliny, we may form some
idea of the immense demand for them, from
the high price at which they continued to be
fold in Rome. To compare the prices of the
fame commodities in ancient ome, with those
now paid in our own country, is rot a gratifi-
cation of curiosity merely, but affords a Itand-
ard by which we may eitimate the different de-
gree of success with which the Indian trade has
been conduced in ancient and modern times.

concerning the extravagant price of precious
tfones and pearls among the Romans, as well as

of the ancients concerning the nature and ori-
gin of silk, which tend to prove their ignorance

ih regard to it. Since the public of M. Ma-
hudel's memoir, P. du Halde has described a
fFecies of silk, of which I believe he communi.
cated the first notice to the moderns. " This is
produced by small infects nearly resembling snails.
They do not form cocoons either round or oval
like the silk-worm, but spin very long threads,
which fasten themselves to trees and bulhes as
they are driven by the wind. These are gather-
ed, and wrought into silk stuffs, coarser than
those produced by domeRiic silk-worms. The
infects who produce this coarse silk are wild."
Description de 'Empire de la Chine, tom. ii.
folio, p. 207. This nearly resembles Virgil's
description,

Velleraque ut foliis depeftant tenuia Seres.

An attentive reader of Virgil will find, that,
besides all the other qualities of a great defcrip-
tive poet, he poefed an extensive knowledge
of natural history. The nature and produc-
tions of the wild silk-worms are illustrated at
greater length in the large collection of Me-
moires concernant l'Hiftoire, les Sciences, les
Arts, &c. des Chinois, tom. ii. p. 575, &c.;
and by Pere de Mailla, in his voluminous His-
tory of China, tom. xiii. p. 434. It is a fin-
gular circumtarfce in the history of silk, that
on account of its being an excretion of a
worm, the Mahomedans confider it as an un-
clean dress; and it has been decided, with the

WHAT an high opinion the ancients had of

Ptolemy, we learn from Agathemerus, who
flourished not long after him. " Ptolemy."
fays he, " who reduced geography into a re-

" it, not carelessly, or merely according to
" ideas of his own; but attending to what had
" been delivered by more ancient authors, he
"adopted from them whatever he found con-
" fnant to truth.'' Epitome Geogr. lib. i. c.

of his work, Agathodaemon, an artist of Alex-

As these public Surveys and Itineraries fur-

nifhed the ancient geographers with the belt in-
formation concerning the position and distances
of many places, it may be proper to point out
the manner in which they were completed by
the Romans. The idea of a general furve of
the whole empire was first fornmed by Julius
Cafar, and, having been begun by him under
authority of a decree of the enate. was finifned
by Augustus. As Rome was still tar inferior to
Greece in science, the execution of this great
undertaking was committed to three Greeks,
men of great abilities, and killcd in every part
of philoiophy. The survey of the eastern divi-
sion of the empire was finished by Zenodoxus in
fourteen years five months and nine days. That
of the northern division was finified by 'lheodo-
tus in twenty years eight months and ten days.
The southern division was finished in twenty-
five years one month and ten days. AEthici Cos-
mographia apud Geographos, editos Hen.
Stephano, 1577. p. 107. This was an under-
taking worthy of those illustrious persons, and
suited to the magnificence of a great people.
Besides this general survey, every new war pro-
duced a new delineation and meafurenent of
the countries which were the feat of it. We
may conclude from Vegetius, Inftit. Rei Mili-
taris, lib. iii. c. 6., that every governor of a
Roman province was fumifhed with a description
of it; in which were specified the distance of
places in miles, the nature of the roads, the
bye-roads, the hort cuts, the mountains, the
rivers, &c.; all thtfe, lays he, were not only
described in words, but were delineated in a

map,

map, that, in deliberating concerning his miii.
tarv mevements, the eves of a general might
aid the decisions of his mind.

NOTE XXIX. SECT. II. p. 63.

THE consequence of this mitfake is remarka-

ble. Ptolemy, lib. vii. c. ., computes the lon-
gitude of Barygaza, or Baroach, to be 17' 20';
and that of Cory, or Cape Comorin, to be
3° 20o' which is the difference of four degrees
precisely ; whereas the real difference between
these two places is nearly fourteen degrees.

NOTE XXX. SECT. II. p. 63.

RA:u-Sro, the publisher of the most ancient,

and perhaps the mofl valuable Colletion of
Vovages, is the fifi person, as far as I know,
who takes notice of this 11range error of Pto-
lemy; Viaggi, vol. i. p. 181. lie jutly ob-
Ienres, that the Author of the Circumnavigation
of the Erythran Sea had been more accurate,
and had described the peninsula of India as
extending from north to south; Peripl. p.
24. 29.

NOTE XXXI. SECT. II. p. 66.

THIS error of Ptolemy justly merits the name

of enormous, which I have given to it; and it
will appear more surprising when we recollect,
that he must have been acquainted, not only
M ith what Herodotus relates concerning the cir-
cumnavigation of Africa, by order of one of
the Egyptian kings, Lib. iv. c 4., but with the

opinion

opinion of Eratoflhenes, who held that the
great extent of the Atlantic ocean was the only
thing which prevented a communication be-
tween Europe .:tl India by lea; Strab. Geogr.
lib. i. p. 113. .

A. his error, however, nmul

not be imputed wholly to Ptolemy. Hippar-
chus, whom we may confider as his guide, had
taught that the earth is ;nt furrounidd by o:le
continuous c( an, but that it is ieparated by
different iftlinifcs, which divide it into levelal
large bafons ; Strab. lib. i.p. I, . 13. Ptolemy,
having adopted this opinion, was induced to
maintain that an unknown country extended
from Cattigara to Praffum on the fouth-ealt
coast of Africa; Geogr. lib. vii. c. 3 and i.
As Ptolemy's fyflem of geography was univer-
sally received, this error spread along with it.
In conformity to it the Arabian geographer
Edrifli, who wrote in the twelfth century,
taught that a continued tract of land stretched
eastward from Sofala on the African coast, until
it united with some part of the Indian conti-
nent; D'Anville, Antiq. p. 187. Annexed to
the firfl volume ofGefta Dei per Francos. there
is an ancient and very rude map of the habitable
globe, delineated according to this idea of Pto-
lemy. M. Goffellin, in his map entitled Ptole-
msei Syftema Geographicum, has exhibited this
imaginary trad of land which Ptolemy sup-
poses to have conneted Africa with Aria;

I. this part of the Disquisition, as well as in

the map prepared for illustrating it, the geogra-
phical ideas of M. D'Anville, to which Major
Rennell has given the fancion of his approba-
tion, Introd. p. xxxix. have been generally a-
dopted. But M. Goffellin has lately published,

"m-, compared with each other, and with the
" Knole e wh-ich the Moderns have acquir-

nus Sinls of I'.olemv he holds to be the fame
with the Gui f m.i raban, not the Gulf of
Sia'n, according to M. D'Anville's decision.
The p.-fi.ion of Cattigara, as he endeavours to
prove, corefponds to that of Mergui, a confi-
dirtbie port on the weft coast of the kingdom
of Siam,' and that Thins, or Sina Metropolis,
which M. D'Anvilil removes as far as Sin-hoa,
in the kingdom of Cochin-China, is situated on
the fame river with Mergui, and now bears the
name of Tana-ferim. The Ibadij Infula of
Ptolemy, which MI. D'Anville determines to be
Sumatra, he contends, is one of that cluster of
f:rali iles which lie o this part of the coat of
Siam; p 137-148. According to iM. Gosse-
lin s fvstem, the ancients never failed through
the Straits of Malacca, had no knowledge of
the island of Sumatra, and were altogether un-
acquainted with the Laitern Ocean. If to any
of mv readers thtce opinions appear to be well
fou.ded, the navigation and commerce of the
an.cin:s in India muit be circumlcribed within
liirits :ill more confined than those which I
have a!!otted to them. From the Ayeen Akbe
ry, vjl. ii. p. 7. we learn that Cheen was an an

cien
2C5

cient name. of the kingdom of Pegu; as that
country borders upon Ava, where M. Goffellin
places the Great Promontory, this near refemb-
lance of names may appear, perhaps, to con-
firm his opinion that Sinre Metropolis was situ-
ated on this coast, and not so far East as M.
D'Anville has placed it.

As Ptolemy's geography of this eastern divi-

sion of Asia is more erroneous, obscure, and
contradicory than in any other part of his
work, and as all the manuscripts of it, both
Greek and Latin, are remarkably incorre in
the two chapters which contain the description
of the countries beyond the Ganges, M. D'An-
ville, in his Memoir concerning the limits of
the world known to the ancients beyond the
Ganges, has admitted into it a larger portion
of conjecure than we find in the other researches
of that cautious geographer. He likewise builds
more than usual upon the resemblances between
the ancient and modern names of places, though
at all times he discovers a propensity, perhaps.
too great, to trace these, and to reft upon them.
These resemblances are often, indeed, very
striking, and have led him to many happy dif-
coveries. But in perusing his works, it is im-
possible, I hould think, not to perceive that
some which he mentions are far fetched and
fanciful. Whenever I follow him, I have a-
dopted only such conclusions as seem to be efta-
blilhed with his accustomed accuracy.

NOTE XXXIII. SECT. II. p. 74.

THE Aethor of the Circumnavigation of the

Erythraan Sea has marked the distances of many
of the places which he mentions, with such ac-

curacy

207

curacy as renders it a nearer approach, than
what is to be found in any writer of antiquity,
to a complete survey of the coast from Myos-
hormus, on the weft fide of the Arabian Gulf,
along the shores of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia,
and Caramania, to the mouth of the Indus, and
thence down the weft coast of the Indian Pe-
ninfula to Mufiris and Barace. This adds to
the value of this short treatise, which, in every
other refpet, possesses great merit. It may be
confidered as a remarkable proof of the extent
and accuracy of this Author's intelligence con-
cerning India, that he is the only ancient writer
who appears in any degree to have been ac-
quainted with the great division of the country,
which still subsists, viz. Indoftan Proper, com-
prehending the northern provinces of the Pe-
ninfula, and the Deccan, comprehending the
southern provinces. " From Barygaza (fays

he) the continent retches to the south;

" hence that district is called Dachinabades,
"for, in the language of the country, the
" south is called Dachanos ;" Peripl. p. 29.
As the Greeks and Romans, when they adopt
any foreign name, always gave it a termina-
tion peculiar to their own language, which the
grammatical ftruture of both tongues rendered,
in some degree, necessary, it is evident that Da-
chanos is the fame with Deccan, which word
has ftihi the fame signification, and is ill the
name of that division of the Peninsula. The
northern limit of the Deccan at present is the
river Nerbuddah, where our Author likewise
fixes it. Peripl. ibid.

TroC:UftH, in deducing the latitudes of places

from obfcrvations of the fun or lars, the anci-
ent aft:'onomers ncglcted several correcions,
which ought to have been applied, their results
were foni-times exact to a few minutes, but at
other times they apecar to have been erroneous
to the extent of two, or even three degrees,
and may perhaps be reckoned, one wiih ano-
ther, to have comne within half a degree of the
truth. This part of the ancient gography
wnuld therlrforc hiave been tolerably accurate,
if there had been a sufficient number of such
deterniinations. These, however, were fr
from being numerous, and appear to have been
confined to lonme of the more remarkable plac s
in the countries which surround the Mediterra-
nean sea.

WHEN, for want of niore accurate obferva-

tions, the latitude was inferred from the length
of the longest or fl rteit dav, no great dgree
of precision was, in any cae, to be expeced,
and leait of all in the vicinity of the Equator.
An error of a quarter of an hour, which, with-
out some mole of measuring time more accu-
rate than ancient oblervers could employ, was
not eahly avoided, might produce, in such situ-
ations, an error of four degrees in the determi-
nation of te latitude.

\VITtH refl)pe to places in the torrid zone,

there was another resource for determining the
latitude. This was by observing the time of the
year when the fun was vertical to any place, or
when bodies that itood perpendicular to the ho-

P rizon

2c9

rizon had no hadow at noon-day; the fun's
distance from the Equatorat that time, which
was known from the principles of astronomy,
was equal to the latituJe of the place. We
have instances of the application of this method
in the determination of the parallels of Syene
and Meroe. The accuracy which this method
would admit of, seems to be limited to about
half a degree, and this only on the supposition
that the observer was tationary; for if he was
travelling from one place to another, and had
not an opportunity of correcing the obfcrvation
of one day by that of the day following, he was
likely to deviate much more considerably from
the truth.

XWITH refpe& to the longitude of places, a;

eclipses of the moon are not frequent, and could
fldorn be of use for determining it, and only
when there were aronomers to observe them
with accuracy, they may be left out of the ac-
count altogether when we are examining the
geo;raphy of remote countries. The differences
of the meridians of places were therefore an-
cier.:lv ascertained entirely by the bearings and
distances of one place from another, and of
consequence all the errors of reckonings, fur.
veys, and itineraries, fell chiefly upon the lon-
gitude, in the fame manner as happens at pre-
sent in a hip which has no method of deter-
mining its longitude, but by comparing the
dead-reckoning with the observations of the
latitude; though with this difference, that the
errors, to which the most skilful of the ancient
navigators was liable, were far greater that
what the most ignorant fhip-mafler of moderI
times, provided with a compass, can well corn
mit. The length of the Mediterranean mea
fured, in degrees of longitude, from the Pillar

c
210

of Hercules to the Bay of Issus, is less than for-
ty degrees; but in Ptolemy's maps it is more
than sixty, and, in general, his longitudes,
counting from the meridian of Alexandria, el-
pecially towards the East, are erroneous nearly
in the fame proportion. It appears, indeed,
that in remote seas, the coasts were often deli-
neated from an imperfeE account of the diflan-
ces failed, without the least knowledge of the
bearings or direction of the hip's course. Pto-
lemy, it is true, used to make an allowance of
about one-third for the winding of a ship's
courle, Geogr. lib. i. c. 2.; but it is plain,
that the application of this general rule could
seldom lead to an accurate conclusion. Of this
there is a triking instance in the form which
that geographer has given to the Peninsula of
India. From the Barygazenum Promontorium
to the place marked Locus unde folvunt in Chry-
fen navigantes, that is, from Surat on the Ma-
labar coast, to about Narfapour on the Coro-
mandel coast, the distance measured along the
sea-shore is nearly the fame with what it is in
reality; that is, about five hundred and twenty
leagues. But the mistake in the dire&ion is
astonishing, for the Malabar and Coromandel
coast, instead of stretching to the south, and in-
terfecting one another at Cape Comorin, in a
very acute angle, are extended by Ptolemy al-
molt in the fame Itraight line from weft to east,
declining a little to the south. This coast is,
at the fame time, marked with several bays and
promontories, nearly resembling, in their po-
fition, those which actually exist on it. All
these circumstances conpared together, point
out very clearly what were the materials from
which the ancient map of India was composed.
The ships which had visited the coast of that
country, had kept an account of the time which

P 2 they

211

they took to s'i! from one place to another, and
had markd, a the' lItiol along fliore, on what
hand th- land lay. when they ihaped their course
acrl'ia a bay. or doubled a promontory. This
impcr:;: jiournal, with an inaccurate account,
perhJ.p, of the latitude of one or two places,
wa, probably all the iniormation concerning the
coast of India, which Ptolemy was able to pro-
cure. 'lnhat he should have been able to procure
no better information from merchants who fail-
ed with no particular view of exploring the
coast, w-ili not appear wonderful, if we confider
that even the celebrated Periplus of Hanno
would not enable a geographer to lay down the
coat of Africa with more precision, than Ptole-
11y has dineatcd that of India.

THIS voyage, together with the ohfervations

of Abu Zeid al Hafan of Siraf, was published by

from those of the splendid descriptions vwhich a
blind admiration had prompted the Jesuits to

that he found it in the library of M. Ie Comte

nufcript since that time, the doubts increased,
and M. Renaudot was charged with the crime
of imposing upon the public. But the Colbert
manuscripts having been dep(tfited in the King's

M. Renaudot's book, my references are made
to the Englih translation. The Relation of the
two Arabian Travellers is confirmed, in many
points, by their countryman Maffoldi, who
published his treatise on univerral hiltory, to
which he gives the fantastical title of " Mea-
" dows of Gold, and Mines of Jewels," a hun-
died and fix years after their time. From him,
likewise, we receive such an account of India
in the tenth century, as renders it evident that
the Arabians had then acquired an extensive
knowledge of that country. According to his
description, the peninsula of India was divided
into four kingdoms. The first was composed of
the provinces situated on the hidus, and the
rivers which fall into it; the capital of which
was Moultan. The capital of the second king-
dom was Canoge, which, fiom the ruins of it
fill remaining, appears to have been a very
large city; Rennell's Memoirs, p. 54. In or-
der to give an idea of its populousness, the In-
dian historians assert, that it contained thirty
thousand shops, in which betel-nut was fold,
and fixtv thousand sets of musicians and fingers,
who paid a tax to government; Ferifhta, tranf-
lated by Dow, vol. i. p. 32. The third king-
dom was Cachemire. Maffoudi, as far as I
know, is the first author who mentions this pa.
radife of India, of which he gives a hort but
juit description. The fourth is the kingdom of
Guzerate, which he represents as the greatest
and most powerful; and he concurs with the
two Arabian Travellers, in giving the fove-
reigns of it the appellation of Balhara. What
Maffoudi relates concerning India is more wor-
thv of notice, as he himielf had visited that
countrv; Notices et Extraits des Manufcrits
de la Bibliotheque du Roi, tom. i. p. 9, lo.
Ilaffoudi confirms what the two Arabian Tra-

vellers

vellers relate, concerning the extraordinary
progress of the Indians in aironomical science.
According to his account, a temple was built
during the reign of Brahman, the first monarch
of India, with twelve towers, representing the
twelve signs of the zodiac; and in which was
delineated, a view of all the stars as they appear
in the heavens. In the fame reign was com-
pored the famous Sind-Hind, which seems to be
the tandard treatise of Indian aitronomy ; No-
tices, &c. tom. i. p. 7. Another Arabian au-
thor, who wrote about the middle of the four-
teenth centuiy, divides India into three parts.

on the Indus. 'hiie middle, extending from
Guzerate to the Ganges. The southern, which
he denominates Comar, from Cape Comorin;

THE naval kill of the Chinese seem to have

been superior to that of the Greeks, the Ro-
mans, or Arabians. 'he course which they
held from Canton to Siraf, near the mouth of
the Persian Gulf is described by their own au-
thors. They kept as near as possible to the
shore until they reached the island of Ceylon,
and then doubling Cape Comorin, they failed
along the welt fide ot the Peninlula, as far as
the mouth of the Indus, and thence steered a-

THE progress of Chriltianity, and of Maho-

medanifm, both in China and India, is attelted
by such evidence as leaves no doubt with ref-
peat to it. This evidence is collected by Affe-
mannus, Biblioth. Orient. vol. iv. p. 437, &c.
521, &c. and by M. Renaudot, in two Differ-
tations annexed to Anciennes Relations; and
by M. de la Croze, Hiftoire de Chriltianifme des
Indes. In our own age, however, we know
that the number of proselytes to either of these
religions is extremely small, especially in India.
A Gentoo confiders all the diftindions and pri-
vileges of his cast, as belonging to him by an
exclusive and incommunicable right. 'To con-

vert, or to be converted, are ideas equally re.
pugnant to the principles most deeply rooted in
his mind; nor can either the Catholic or Pro-
teftant miflionaries in india boast of having o.
vercome these prejudices, except among a few
in the lowefi casts, or of such as have loft their
cast altogether. This last circumstance is a great
obstacle to the progress of Christianity in India.
As Europeans eat the flesh of that animal which
the Hindoos deem sacred, nd drink intoxicat-
ing liquors, in hich practices they are imitated
by the converts to Chriltianity, this finks them
to a level with the Pariars, the mot contemptu-
ous and odious race of men. Some Catholic
mifionaries were so sensible of this, that they
affeded to imitate the dress and manner of living
of Brahmins, and refused to associate with the
Pariars, or to admit them to a participation of
the sacraments. But this was condemned by
the apollolic legate Tournon, as inconfifent
with the spirit and precepts of the Christian re-
ligion; Voyage aux Indes Orientales, par M.
Sonnerat, tom. i. p. 58. note. Notwithltanding
the labours of mifionaries for upwards of two
hundred years, (fays a late ingenious writer,)
and the eftabli{hments of different Christian na-

those of the present age, it is probable, that
the Christians and Mahomedans, said to be oI
numerous in India and China, were chiefly so-
reigners, allured thither by a lucrative com-
merce, or their descendants. The number of
Mahomedans in China has been considerably in-

FROM the Chronicle of Andrew Dandulo,

imported from it all the producions of the East,
it was natural to expe& some information con-

IT is proper to remark (fays Mr. Stewartt

that the Indians have an admirable method of
rendering their religion lucrative, it being usual
for the Faquirs to carry with them, in their pil-
grimages from the sea-coasts to the interior
parts, pearls, corals, spices, and other precious
articles, of small bulk, which they exchange, on
their return, for gold-dufl, musk, and other
things of a similar nature, concealing them easily
in their hair, and in the cloths round their
middle, carrying on, in proportion to their
numbers, no inconfiderahle traffic by these

CAFFA is the mos commodious flation for

NEITrHFR Jovius, the professed panegyrif of

the Medici, nor Jo. M. Brutus, their detractor,
though both mention the exorbitant wealth of
the family, explain the nature of the trade by
which it was acquired. Even Machiavel, whose
genius delighted in the investigation of every
circumstance which contributed to aggrandize
or depress nations, seems not to have viewed
the commerce of his country as a subjet that
merited any elucidation. Denina, who has en-
titled the irft chapter of his eighteenth book,
"The Origin of the Medici, and the Com-
"mencement of their Power and Grandeur,'
furnishes little information with regard to the
trade carried on by them. This silence of so
many authors is a proof that historians had not
vet begun to view commerce as an object ou
such importance in the political fiate of nations,
as to enter into any detail concerning its natui e
and effets. From the references of different
writers to Scipio Ammirato, lidorie Fiorentinc;
to Pagnini, Della Decima ed altri gravezze dcl-
la Mercatura, I should imagine that something
more fatisadory may be learned concerning
the trade both of the republic and family ot
the Medici; but I could not find any of thelf
books either in Edinburgh or in London.

LEIBNITZ has preserved a curious paper,

containing the inftru&tions of the republic of
Florence to the two ambassadors sent to the Sol-
dan of Egypt, in order to negociate this treaty
with him, together with the report of there
ambassadors on their return. The great obje&
of the republic was, to obtain liberty of trading
in all parts of th- Soldan's dominions, upon
the fame terms with the Venetians. The chief
privileges which they solicited, were; i. A
perfet freedom of admiflion into every port
belonging to the Soldan, protecion while they
continued in it, and liberty of departure at
what time they chose. 2. Permission to have a
consul, with the fame rights and jurifdition as
those of the Venetians; and liberty to build a
church, a ware house, and a bath, in every
place where they fettled. 3. That they hould
not pay for goods imported or exported, higher
duties than were paid by the Venetians. 4. That
the effects of any Florentine who died in the
dominions of the Soldana hould be consigned
to the consul. 5. That the gold and silver coin
of Florence hould be received in payments.
All these privileges (which Ihew on what equal
and liberal terms Christians and Mahomedans
now carried on trade) the Florentines obtained

T Eaaern parts of Asia are now so comi-

pletelv explored, that the firil imperfct accounts
of them, by Marco Polo. attract little of that
attention which was originallv excited by the
publication of his travels; and ome circum-
itances in his narrative have induced different
authors to justify this neg!l-t, by calling in
quetlion the truth of what he relates, and even
to aet that he had never viitted those coun-
tries which he pretends to de!cribe. He does
not, fay they, ascertain the potition of any one
place, by specifying its longitude or latitude.
HIe gives names to provinces and cities, parti-
cularly in his description of (Cathav, which have
no relemblancc to those which thev now bear.
\Ve mav observe, however, that as Marco Polo
seems to have been, in no degree, a man of
science, it was not to be expected that he flhould
fix the position of places with geographical ac-
curacy. As he travelled through China, either
in the suite of the great Khan, or in execution
of his orders, it is probable that the names
which he gives to different provinces and cities,
are those by which they were known to the
Tartars, in whose service he was, not their ori-
ginal Chinele names. Some inaccuracies which
have been observed in the relation of his tra-
veli, mav be accounted for, bv attending to one
circumtance, that it was not pblililhed from a
regular journal, which, perhaps, the viciii-
tudes in his situation, during such a long series
of adventures, did not permit him to keep, or
to prefirve. It was composed after his return
to his native country, and chiefly from recollec-
tion. But notwithstanding this disadvantage,

his account of those regions of the East, to-
wards which my inquiries have been directed,
contains information with refpec to several par-
ticulars, altogether unknown in Europe at that
time, the accuracy of which is now fully con-
firmed. I hall mention some of these, which,
though they relate to matters of no great con.
sequence, afford the belt proof of his having
visited these countries, and of his having ob-
served the manners and customs of the people
with attention. He gives a diftin& account of
the nature and preparation of Sago, the princi-
ple article of subsistence among all the nations
of Malayan race, and he brought the first fpe-
cimen of this singular produEtion to Venice,

the general custom of chewing Betel, and his
description of the mode of preparing it, is the
fame with that still in use. Ramus. Viaggi, i.

The commodities of the TEaRt were still brought
to the Malabar coast by velfels of the county,
and conveyed thence, together with pepper,
and other producions peculiar to that part of
India, by ships which arrived from the Red Sea.

for the superior quality which Sanudo ascribes

trade at this period.-- . There is in Ry.
mer's Great Collection, a series of grants from
the kings of England, of various privileges and
immunities to Vtnetian merchants trading in
England, as well as several commercial treaties
with the republic, which plainly indicate a con-
fiderable increase of their tranfations in that
country. These are mentioned in their order
by Mr. Anderson, to whose patient industry and
found understanding, every person engaged in
any commercial research must have felt himself
greatly indebted on many occasions.-- 2. The
eftablithment of a Bank by public authority, the
credit of which was founded on that of the
state. In an age and nation so well acquainted
with the advantages which commerce derives
from the institution of banks, it is unnecessary
to enumerate them. Mercantile tranfaftions
must have been numerous and extensive before
the utility of such an institution could be fully
percci.ed, or sie principles of trade could be
so fully underftocd as to form the regulations
proper ':.r ccnducting it with success. Venice
may boat of having given the first example to
Europe of an eflabliffitent hitherto unknown to
the ancients, and which is the pride of the mo-
dern commercial fiytem. The constitution of
the bank of Venice was originally founded on
such juit principles, that it has served as a mo-
del in the eftablifment of banks in other coun-
tries, ?.id the administration of its affairs has
been conducted with so much integrity, that its
credit has never been haken. I cannot specify

board which were employed seventeen thousand
sailors ; of three hundred hips of greater force,
manned by eight thousand sailors; and of forty-
five large galeaffes, or caracks, navigated by
eleven thousand sailors. In public and private

" In travelling through the desert, camels are
"chiefly employed, because they consume lit-

" burden is about seven hundred and fifty
" pounds; his food, whatever is given him,
" straw, thifiles, the tfones of dates, beans,
"barley, &c. With a pound of food a day,
"and as much water, he will travel for weeks.
" In the journey from Cairo to Suez, which is
"forty or forty-fix hours, they neither eat nor
"drink; but thele long falls, if often repeated,
" wear them out. Their usual rate of travel-
" ling is very flow, hardly above two miles an
"hour; it is vain to pufl them, they will not
"quicken their pace, but, if allowed some short
"reft, they will travel fifteen or eighteen hours

IN order to give an adequate idea of the ex.

tensive circulation of Indian commodities ty
land carriage, it would be necessary to trace the
route, and to estimate the number, of the va-
rious caravans by which they are conveyed.
Could this be executed with accuracy, it would

be

231

be a curious object of geographical research,
as well as a valuable addition to commercial
hiRory. Though it is inconfitent with the bre.
vity which I have uniformly Rudied in condu&-
ing this Disquisition, to enter into a detail of so
great length, it may be proper, for illustrating
this part of my subject, to take such a view of
two caravans which visit Mecca, as may enable
my readers to estimate more jultly the magni.
tude of their commercial tranfa&ions. The
first is the caravan which takes its departure
from Cairo in Egypt, and the other from Da-
mafcus in Syria; and I fele& there, both be-
cause they are the most considerable, and be.
cause they are described by authors of un-
doubted credit, who had the best opportunities
of receiving full information concerning them.
The former is composed not only of pilgrims
from every part of Egypt, but of those which
arrive from all the small Mahomedan states on
the African coast of the Mediterranean, from
the empire of Morocco, and even from the Ne-
groe kingdoms on the Atlantic. When assem-
bled, the caravan consists at least of fifty thou-
tand persons, and the number of camels em.
ploved in carrying water, provisions, and mer-
chandize, is ftiil greater. The journey which,
in going from Cairo and returning thither, is
not conpleted in leai than a hundred days, is
performed wvholly by land; and as the route
lies molily through landv deserts, or barren un-
inhabited ild,, which seldom afford any sub-
fiitence, and wlil.e often no sources of water
can be fountd, the pilgrims alway3s undergo much
ta'i-ue, and ibmetiines muff endure incredible
hardlips. An earls and good description of
,ir;s caravan is publiihed by Hakluyt, vol. ii. p.

composed of pilgrims from almost every pro-
vince of the Turkiih empire, is little inferior to
the former in number, and the commerce which
it carries on is hardly less valuable. Voyage de
Volney, tom. ii. p. 25 i, &c. This pilgrimage
was performed in the year 174 , by'Khojeh Ab-
dulkurreem, whom I formerly mentioned, Note
IV. p. 177. He gives the usual route from Da-
mafcus to Mecca, computed by hours, the com-
mon mode of reckoning a journey in the East
through countries little frequented. According
to the most moderate estimate, the distance be-
tween the two cities, by his account, mutt be
above a thousand miles; a great part of the
journey is through a desert, and the pilgrims
not only endure much fatigue, but are often ex-
posed to much danger from the wild Arabs.
Memoirs, p. I 14, &c. It is a singular proof of
the predatory spirit of the Arabs, that although
all their independent tribes are zealous Maho-
medans, yet they make no scruple of plunder-
ing the caravans of pilgrims, while engaged in
performing one of the most indispensable duties
of their religion. Great as these caravans are,
we mufft not suppose that all the pilgrims who
visit Mecca belong to them; such considerable
additions are received from the extensive domi-
nions of Persia, from every province of In-
doftan, and the countries to the East of it, from
Abyssinia, from various states on the Southern
coast of Africa, and from all parts of Arabia,
that when the whole are aflembled, they have
been computed to amount to two hundred thou-
and. In some years the number is farther in-

creased

233

creased by small bands of pilgrims from several
interior provinces of Africa, the names and situ.
ations of which are just beginning to be known
in Europe. For this last sac we are indebted
to the Afrociation for promoting the Discovery
of the interior Parts of Africa, formed by some
Britith Gentlemen upon principles so liberal,
and with views so public-fpirited, as do honour
to themselves and to their country. Proceed.
ings, &c. p. 174.

IN the Report of the Committee of the Privy

Council on the Slave Trade, other particulars
are contained; and it appears that the com.
merce carried on by caravans in the interior
parts of Africa is not only widely extended, but
of considerable value. Bfdes the great caravan
which proceeds to Cairo, and is joined by Ma-
homedan pilgrims from every pait of Africa,
there are caravans which have no object but
commerce, which set out from Fez, Algiers,
Tunis, Tripoli, and other States on the sea coast,
and penetrate far into the interior country.
Some of them take no less than fifty days to
reach the place of their destination; and, as the
medium of their rate of travelling muff be eti.
mated at about eighteen miles a day, the extent
of their journey may be easily computed. As
both the time of their outset, and their route,
are known, they are met by the people of all
the couniries through which they travel, who
trade wkith them Indian goods of every kind
form a considerable article in this traffic, in ex-
change for mhkh the chief commodity they can
give is Slaves. Part vi.

As the journits of the caravans, which are

purely commercial, do not commence at tfated
fealons, and their routes vry according to the

convenience
234

convenience or fancy of the merchants of whom
they are composed, a description cannot be
given of them with the fame degree of accu-
racy. But by attending to the accounts of some
authors, and the occasional hints of others,
sufficient information may be gathered to satisfy
us, that the circulation of Eastern goods by
these caravans is very extensive. The fame in-
tercourfe which was anciently kept up by the
provinces in the North-ealt of Asia with In-
doftan and China, and which 1 formerly de-
fcribed, still subsists. Among all the nume-
rous tribes of Tartars, even of those which re-
tain their pafforal manners in greatest purity,
the demand for the producions of these two
countries is very considerable. Voyages de
Pallas, tom. i. p. 357, &c. tom. ii. p. 422. In
order to supply them with these, caravans set
out annually from Boghar, (Hakluyt, vol. i.
p. 332.) Samarcand, Thibet, and several
other places, and return with large cargoes of
Indian and Chinese goods. But the trade car-
ried on between Russia and China in this part
of Asia is by far the most extensive and best
known. Some connection of this kind, it is
probable, was kept up between them from the
carlieft period, but it increased greatly after the
interior parts of Ruilia were rendered more ac-
cellible by the conquests of Zingis Khan and
Tamerlane. The commercial nations of Europe
were so well acquainted with the mode of cai-
rying on this trade, that loon after the Por-
tuguefe had opened the communication with
the aft by the Cape of Good Hope, an at-
tempt was made in order to diminifl .the ad-
vantages which they derived from this disco-
very, to prevail on the Ruffians to convey
Indian and Chinese commodities through the
whole extent of their empire, partly by land-

carriage

235

carriage and partly by means of navigable
rivers, to some port on the Baltic, from which
they might be distributed through every part of
Europe. Ramufio Raccolto da Viaggi, vol. i.
p. 374 B. This scheme, too great for the
monarch then on the throne of Russia to carry
into execution, was rendered practicable by
the conquests of Ivan Bafilowitz, and the ge-
nius of Peter the Great. Though the capitals
of the two empires were situated at the immense
diltance of fix thousand three hundred and fe-
venty-eight miles from each other, and the
route lay for above four hundred miles through
an uninhabited desert, (Bell's Travels, vol. ii. p.
167.) caravans travelled from the one to the
cther. But though it had been stipulated when
this intercourse was established, that the num-
ber of persons in each caravan should not ex-
ceed two hundred, and though they were shut
up within the walls of a Caravanserai during
the mhort time they remained in Pekin, and
were allowed to deal only with a few merchants,
to whom a monopoly of the trade with them
had been granted; yet, notwithstanding all
these retraints and precautions, the jealous vi-
gilance with which the Chinese government
excludes foreigners from a free intercourse with
its subjects was alarmed, and the admission of
the Ruffian caravans into the empire was soon
prohibited. After various negociations, an
expedient was at length devised, by which the
advantages of mutual commerce were secured,
uirhout infringing the cautious arrangements
of Chinese policy. On the boundary of the
two empires, two small towns were built almotl
contiguous, the one inhabited by Ruffians, the
other by Chinese. To these all the marketable
productions of their respective countries are
brought by the fubjecs of each empire; and

the
a36

the furs, the linen and woollen cloth, the lea-
ther, the glass, &c. of Russia, are exchanged
for the silk, the cotton, the tea, the rice, the
toys, &c. of China. By some well-judged con-
cessions of the sovereign now feated on the
throne of Russia, whose enlarged mind is fupe-
rior to the illiberal maxims of some of her pre-
deceffors, this trade is rendered so flourihing,
that its amount annually is not less than eight
hundred thousand pounds sterling, and it is the
only trade with China carried on almost en-
tirely by barter. Mr. Coxe, in his account of
the Ruffian discoveries, has colleced, with his
usual attention and discernment, every thing re-
lative to this branch of trade, the nature and
extent of which were little known in Europe.
Chap. ii. iii. iv. Nor is this the only place
where Russia receives Chinese and Indian com-
modities. A considerable supply of both is
brought by caravans of independent Tartars to
Orenburg, on the river Jaik, Voyage de Pallas,

Oui, and to other places which I might men-
tion. I have entered into this long detail con-
cerning the mode in which the prcdutions in
India and China are circulated through Russia,
as it affords the most striking inflance, I know,
of the great extent to which valuable conmodi-
ties may be conveyed by land carriage.

NOTWITHSTANDING this increaing demand

for the producions of India, it is remarka-
ble, that during the sixteenth century, some
commodities which are now the chief arti-
cles of importation from the East, were either
altogether unknown, or of little account.
Tea, the importation of which, at present, tar
exceeds that of any other produEtion of the
East, has not been in general use, in any coun-
try of Europe, a full century; and yet, dur-
ing that ihort period, from some singular ca-
price of taste, or power of fahion, the in-
fusion of a leaf brought from the farthest ex-
tremity of the earth, of which it is perhaps
the highest praise to fay that it is innoxious,
has become aimoft a necessary of life in feve-
ral parts of Europe, and the paflion for it de-
scends from the most elevated to the lowest
orders in society. In 1785 it was computed
that the whole quantity of tea imported into
Europe from China was about nineteen milli-
ons of pounds, of which it is conjectured that
twelve millions were confiumed in Great Bri-
tain and the dominiorns depending upon it.

derns who mentioned it. The Porrugucfe began
to import it not long after their filtl voyage

time before the uie of it became extenive.

SHALL now endeavour to fulfil an en-
gagement which I came under', to make

some observations upon the genius, the man.
ners, and institutions of the people of India,
as far as they can be traced from the earliest
ages to which our knowledge of them extends.
Were I to enter upon this wide field with an
intention of surveying its whole extent; were I
to view each object which it presents to a phi-
lofophical inquirer, under all its different as-
pees, it would lead me into researches and fpe-
culations, not only of immense length, but al-
together foreign from the fubje& of this Dif-
quifition. My inquiries and refletions hall
therefore be confined to what is intimately con-
neted with the design of this work. I mhall
collec the fa&s which the ancients have tranf-
mitted to us concerning the inftitotions peculiar
to the natives of India, and, by comparing them
with what we know of that country, endeavour
to deduce such conclusions as tend to point our
the circumstances which have induced the reft
of mankind, in every age, to carry .o commer-
cial intercourse to so great an etefit with that
country.

Or this intercourse there areconl'iicuiu,

proofs in e carlii- period coiicernin v.'h: 1
lt.iory affords infor:untion. Not only the peo-
ple contiguous to l bIia, but remote nations,
seem to ha\l been ac.quaint-d, fronm time im-
me:norial, with it- c':rimodities, and to have
valued them so hi;hiv, that in order to procure
them they undertook fatiguing, expensive, and
dangerous journeys. Wlhenever men give a
decided preifrence to the conmmodities of any
particular country, this mult be owing either to
its poffefiing some valuable natural productions
peculiar to its foil and climate, or to some fu-
perior progress which its inhabitants have made
in industry, art, and elegance. It is not to any
peculiar excellence in the natural producions
of India, that we must ascribe entirely the pre-
dilection of ancient nations for its commodi-
ties; for, pepper excepted, an article, it muff
be allowed, of great importance, they are little
different from those of other tropical coun-
tries; and Ethiopia or Arabia might have fully
supplied the Phenicians, and other trading peo-
ple cf antiquity, wi:h the spices, theperfuiiles,
the precious itones, the gold and silver, which
formed the principal articles of their com-
merce.

WHOEv ER then wiflhes to trace the commerce

with India to its source, muff search for it, not
it much in any peculiarity of the natura! pro-
ductions of that country, as in the fuperuor im-
p-ovement of its inhabitants. .Ianrv facts l:.ve
been transmitted to us, which, if they are x-
.;.nined with propr attention, clearly deluon
itrate, that the natives of India were not only
more ca. i civilized, but had made greater pro-

Fk
44

grcfs in civilization than any other pcople These
I flall endeavour to enumerate, and to place
them in such a point of view as man.y frve both
to throw light upon the institutions, mnanners,
and arts of the Indians, and to account for the
eagerness of all nations to obtain the produdions
of their ingenious indufirv.

BY the ancient Heathen writers, the Indi ins

were reckoned those races of men which they
denominated Autochthones or A.orig::;s, whomn
they confidered as natives of th, foil, whoic
origin could not be traced . By the inspired
writers, the wisdom of the East (an expression
which is to be understood as a description of
their extraordinary progress in science and arts)
was early celebrated '. In order to illustrate
and confirm these explicit teftinonies concern-
ing the ancient and high civilization of the in-
habitants of India, I shall take a view of their
rank and condition as individuals; of their
civil policy; of their laws and judicial proceed-
ings; of their useful and elegant arts; of their
sciences; and of their religious institutions;
as far as information can be gathered from the
accounts of the Greek and Roman writers, com-
pared with what tfill remains of their ancient
acquirements and institutions.

I. FROM the most ancient accounts of India

we learn, that the diftinstion of ranks and fe-
paration of professions were completely eta-
blified there. This is one of the most un-
doubted proofs of a society considerably advan-
ced in its progress. Arts in the early Itages of
social life are so few, and so simple, that each
man is sufficiently mailer of them all, to gratify

every

every demand of his own limited desires. A
savage can form his bow, point his arrows, rear
his hut, and hollow his canoe, without calling
in the aid of any hand more sKilful than his
own . But wh;n time has augmsnted the
wants of men, the produtions of art become
so complicated in their ftrudture, or so curious
in their fabric, that a particular course of edu-
cation is requisite towards forming the artist to
ingenuity in contrivance and expertness in exe-
cution. In proportion as refinement spreads,
the dltinction of profefions increases, and
thev branch out into more numerous and mi-
nutefubdivi'ons. Prior to the records of au-
thentic hilcs rv,and even before the most remote
aera to which their own traditions pretend to
reach, this separation of profefions had not
only takin place among the natives of India,
but the pcrpetuity of it was secured by an infti-
tution which mut be confidered as the funda-
mental article in the system of their policy.
The whole body of the people was divided into
four orders or calls. The members of the first,
deemed the molt sacred, had it for their pro-
vince, t, fludv the principles of religion; to
perform its functions; and to cultivate the fci-
enrces. They were the priests, the inftrutors,
and philosophers of the nation. The members
of the second order were entrusted with the go-
vernment and defence of the state. In peace
they were its rulers and magistrates, in war they
were the soldiers who fought its battles. The
third was compored of husbandmen and mer-
chants; and the fourth of artisans, labourers,
and servants. None of these can ever quit his
own cast, or be admitted into another e. The

station of every individual is unalterably fixed;
his destiny is irrevocable; and the walk of life
is marked out, from which he must never de-
viate. This line of separation is not only
eltablilhed by civil authority, but.confirmed
and fanEioned by religion; and each order or
calf is said to have proceeded from the Divinity
in such a different manner, that to mingle and
confound them would be deemed an a of most
daring impiety . Nor is it between the four
different tribes alone that such insuperable bar,
riers are fixed; the members of each cast ad-
here invariably to the profelfion of their fore-
fathers. From generation to generation, the
fame families have followed, and will always
continue to follow, one uniform line of life.---

SvcN arbitrary arrangements of the various

members which compose a community, feeri,
at first. view, to be adverse to improvement ei-
ther in science or in arts; and by forming
around the different orders of men, artificial
barriers, which it would be impious to pass,
tend to circumscribe the operations of the ha-
man mind with a narrower sphere than nature
has allotted to them. When every man is at
full liberty to dire& his efforts towards those
obje&s and that end which the impulse of his
own mind prompts him to prefer, he may be
expected to attain that high degree of eminence
to which the uncontrouled exertions of genius
and industry naturally conduc. The regula-
tions of Indian policy, with refpet to the dif-
ferent orders of men, must necessarily, at some
times, check genius in its career, and confine
to the funcions of an inferior cast, talents fitted
to shine in an higher sphere. But the arrange-

f See NOTE I.

ments

247

ments of civil government are made, not for
what is extraordinary, but for what is common;
no: for the few, but for the many. The objec
of the frft Indian legislators was to employ the
moil ecrf'eual means of providing for the sub-
fiience, the security, and happiness of all the
members of the co::munity over which they
presided. With this view they ft apart certain
races of men for each of the various professions
and arts neceffarv in a well ordere. society, and
appointed the exercise of them to be transmitted
from father to son in fucceflion. 'lhis fptem,
though extremely repugnant to the ideas which
we, by being placed in a very different state of
society, have formed, will be found, upon at-
tentive infpe&tion, better adapted to attain the
end in view, than a careless oferver is, on a
first view, apt to imagine. The human mind
bends to the law of reccffirv. and is accuflomed,
not o;.Il to accom;..odate itself to the rellraints
w-lch the conJiti, n of its nature, or the infti-
tuielnS of its c. untry, impose, but to acquiesce
in tcm. Fr m his entrance into life, an Indian
kr . - the ;ation allotted to him, and the
fr.c'.-ns to uhich he is destined by his birth.
'li- cb'cs xUhich relate to there are the firil
tS pr.cient themfeves to his iew. They oc-
cupV hii thoughts, or employ his hands; and,
from. his carlieft ears, he is trained to the ha-
bit of deoing .ith ease and pleasure that wlich
he n t co ntinue through life to do. To this
rr.v be acribed that high degree of perfection
cT.pi cuu in manv of the Indian manufac-
tures: and though encraticn for the practices
of ter a.ccftors may check the spirit of inven-
ticr., ye, by adhering to thele, they acquire
fi:ch an cxfertnefs and delicacy of hand, that
Luropeans, with all the advantages of uperior
science. and the aid of more complete infiru-

mients,

ments, have never been able to equal the cx-
quifite execution of their workmanship. While
this high improvement of their more curious
manufadures excited the admiration, and at-
tracted the commerce, of other nations, the
separation of profefions in India, and the early
ditribution of the people into classes, attached
to particular kinds of labour, secured such a-
bundance of the more common and useful com-
modities, as not only supplied their own wants,
but miniitered to those of the countries around
them.

To this early divifron of the people into cads,

we must likewise afcibe a striking peculiarity
in the Itate of India ; the permanence of its in-
ftitutions, and the immutability in the manners
of its inhabitants. What now is in India, al-
ways was there, and is likely still to continue:
neither the ferocious violence and illiberal fana-
ticism of its Mahomedan conquerors, nor the
power of its European matters, have effetced
any considerable alteration . The ame dif-
tinciions of condition take place, the lame ar-
rangements in civil and domestic lociety remain,
the lame maxims of religion are hbld in v-r-
ration, and the fame sciences and arts are cul-
tivated. Hence, in all ages, the trade with In-
dia has been the fame; gold and silver have
uniformly been carried thither in order to pui-
chafe the fame commodities with which it now
supplies all nations; and from the age of Pliny
to the present times, it has been always confi-
dered and execrated as a gulf which Iwallows
up the wealth of every other country, tha;
flows incessantly towards it, and fromn w-rhch it
never returns . According to the accounts

s See NOTE II. t See NOTE IIT.

which

249

which I have given of the cargoes anciently
imported from India, they appear to have con-
fined of nearly the fame articles with those of
the investments in our own time; and whatever
difference we may observe in them seems to have
arisen, not so much from any diversity in the
nature or the commodities which the Indians
prepared for sale, as from a variety in the taftes,
or in the wants, of the nations which demanded
them.

II. ANOTHER proof of the early and high

civilization of the people of India, may be de-
duced from confidering their political conftitu-
tion and form of government. The Indians
trace back the history of their own country
through an immense succession of ages, and as-
fert, that all Asia, from the mouth of the Indus
on the weft, to the confines of China on the
east, and from the mountains of Thibet on the
north, to Cape Comorin on the south, formed
a vas empire, subjea to one mighty sovereign,
under whom ruled several hereditary Princes
and Rajahs. But their chronology, which
measures the life of man in ancient times by
thousands of years, and computes the length of
the several periods, during which it supposes
;he world to have existed, by millions, is so
widely extravagant, as not to merit any serious
difcufion. We must reft satisfied, then, until
bome more certain information is obtained with
respect to the ancient history of India, with
taking the firt accounts of that country, which
can be deemed authentic, from the Greeks,
who served under Alexander the Great. They
founj kingdoms of considerable magnitude
eitat!ifs.ed in that country. The territories of
Pru; ..n of Taxiles comprehended a great
iar o te Panja., one of the most fertile and

belt
250

best cultivated countries in India. The king-
dom of the Prafij, or Gandaridse, firetched to
a great extent on both fides of the Ganges. All
the three, as appears from the ancient Greek
writers, were powerful and populous.

THIS description of the partition of India into

fRates of such magnitude, is alone a convincing
proof of its having advanced far in civilization.
In whatever region of the earth there has been
an opportunity of observing the progress of men
in social life, they appear at first in small in-
dependent tribes or communities. Their com-
mon wants prompt them to unite; and their
mutual jealousies, as well as the necessity of fe-
curing subsistence, compel them to drive to a
distance every rival who might encroach on
those domains which they confider as their own.
Many ages elapse before they coalesce, or ac-
quire sufficient foresight to provide for the
wants, or sufficient wisdom to conduE the as-
fairs of a numerous society. Even under the
genial climate, and in the rich foil of India,
more favourable perhaps to the union and in-
crease of the human species than any other part
of the glo e, the formation of such extensive
fates, as were eltabiifhed in that country when
first visited by Europeans, must have been a
work of long time; and the members of them
must have been long accustomed to exertions of
useful industry.

THOUGH monarchical government was efla.

blifhed in all the countries of India to which
the knowledge of the ancients extended, the
sovereigns were far from poffefling uncontrouled
or despotic power. No trace, indeed, is dif-
covered there of any assembly or public body,
the members of which, either in their own

right,

251

right, or as representatives of their fellow-
citizcns, could interpose in enacing laws, or
in superintending the execution of them. In-
ftitutions decined to assert and guide the rights
bel.r. ing to men in a social state. how familiar
soever the idea may be to the people of Europe,
never formed a part of the political constitution
in any great Asiatic kingdom. It was to differ-
ent principles that the natives of India were in-
debted for reftrFctions which limited the exer-
cile of regal power. The rank of individuals
was unalterably fixed, and the privileges of
the different casts were deemed inviolable. The
monarchs of India, who are all taken from the
second of the four clalles formerly described,
which is intruded with the funcions of go-
vernment and exercise of war, behold among
their fubjets an order of men far superior to
themselves in dignity, and so conscious of their
own pre-eminence, both in rank and in fanltity,
that they would deem it degradation and pollu-
tion, if they were to eat of the fame food with
their sovereign . Their persons are sacred, and
even for the most heinous crimes they cannot
be capitally punished; their blood muff never
be sied . To men in this exalted flation mo-
narchs must look up with respect, and reverence
them as the miniflers of religion, and the
teachers of wisdom. On important occasions,
it is the duty of sovereigns to consult them, and
to be direted by their advice. Their admo-
nitions, and even their censures, mufft be re-
ceived with submissive refpe&. This right of
the Brahmins to offer their opinion with refpe&
t3 the adminiftraticn of public affairs was not
unknown to the ancients ; and in some ac-

counts preserved in India of the events which
happened in their own country, princes are
mentioned, who, having violated the privileges
of the casts, and disregarded the remonitrances
of the Brahmins, were deposed by their autho-
rity, and put to death .

WHILE the sacred rights of the Brahmins

opposed a barrier against the encroachments of
regal power on one hand, it was circumscribed
on the other by the ideas which those who occu-
pied the highest fiations in society entertained
of their own dignity and privileges. As none
but the members of the cart next in rank to
that which religion has rendered sacred, could
be employed in any funcion of the Itate, the
sovereigns of the extensive kingdoms anciently
established in India, found it necefi:ary to entrust
them with the superintendence of the cities and
provinces too remote to be under their own im-
mediate infpeftion. In these Rations they often
acquired such wealth and iiiuence, that offices
conferred during pi ature, continued in their
far!ilies, and they came gradually to form an
interiediate order between the lovereign and
his fubjets ; and by the vigilant jealousy with
which they maintained their own dignity and
privileges, they coiitrained their rulers to ref-
pec them, and to govern with equity.

NOR were the benefits of these restraints

upon the power of the sovereign confined wholly
to the to luperior O;rders in the state ; tev
extended, in ome degree, to the third cla s
employed in agriculture. The labours of that

numerous and useful body of men are so effen.
tial to the preservation and happiness of society,
that the greatest attention was paid to render
their condition secure and comfortable. Ac-
cording to the ideas which prevailed among the
natives of India (a we are informed by the first
European who visited their country), the so-
vereign is confidered as the sole universal pro-
prietor of all the land in his dominions, and
from him is derived every species of tenure by
which his fubjefs can hold it. These lands
were let out to the farmers who cultivated
them, at a Ripulated rent, amounting usually
to a fourth part of their annual produce paid
in kind . a country where the price of
work is extremely low, and where the labour of
cultivation is very inconsiderable, the earth
yielding its productions almost spontaneously,
where subsistence is amazingly cheap, where
few clothes are needed, and houses are built
ndfifhed at little expence, this rate cannot
be deemed exorbitant or oppressive. As long
as the husbandman continued to pay the efta-
blifhed rent, he retained possession of the farm,
which descended, like property, from father to
son.

THESE accounts given by ancient authors of

the condition and tenure of the renters of land
in India, agree so perfectly with what now takes
place, that it may be confidered almost as a de-
scription of the present Rate of its cultivation.
In every part of India, where the native Hin-
doo Princes retain dominion, the Ryots, the
modern name by which the renters of land are
ditinguiihed, hold their poffiions by a lease,

which

which may be confidered as perpetual, and at a
rate fixed by ancient surveys and valuations.
This arrangement has been so long established,
and accords so well with the ideas of the na-
tives, concerning the diftinftions of cafls, and
the funcions allotted to each, that it has been
inviolably maintained in all the provinces sub-
je& either to Mahomedans or Europeans; and,
to both, it serves as the basis on which their
whole system of finance is founded P. In a
more remote period, before the original infii-
tutions of India were subverted by foreign in-
vaders, the industry of the huibandman, on
which every member of the community de-
pended for subsistence, was as secure as the te-
nure by which he held his lands was equitable.
Even war did not interrupt his labours or en-
danger his property. It was not uncommon,
we are informed, that while two hostile armies
were fighting a battle in one field, the peasants
were ploughing or reaping in the next field in
perfet tranquillity 9. These maxims and regu-
lations of the ancient legislators of India have a
near resemblance to the system of those ingenious
modern speculators on political oconomy, who
represent the produce of land as the sole source
of wealth in every country; and who confider
the discovery of this principle, according to
which they contend that the government of na-
tions should be conduted, as one of the greatest
efforts of human wisdom. Under a form of
government, which paid such attention to all
the different orders of which the society is colm-
posed, particularly the cultivators of the earth,
it is not wonderful that the ancients (hould de-
fcribethe Indians as a molt happy race of men;
and that the most intelligent modern obIcrie,

nould celebrate the equity, the humanity, and
mildness of Indian policy. A Hindoo Rajah,
as I have be.n informed by persons well ac-
quain: e wi:h the tlate of India, resembles more
a father presiding in a numerous family of his
own children, than a sovereign ruling over in-
feriors, subject to his dominion. He endea.
vours to secure their happiness with vigilant so-
licitude; they are attached to him with the
most tender affection and inviolable fidelity.

TWe can hardly conceive men to be placed in any
slate more favourable to their acquiring all the
advantages derived from social union. It is
only when the mind is perfectly at ease, and
neither feels nor dreads opprefflon, that it em-
ploys its active powers in forming numerous ar-
rangements of police, for securing its enjoy.
ments and increasing them. Many arrange-
ments of this nature the Greeks, though ac-
customed to their own institutions, the most
periet at that time in Europe, observed and
admired among the Indians, and mention them
as instances of high civilization and improve-
ment. There were established among the In-
dians three distinct classes of officers, one of
which had it in charge to inspect agriculture,
and every kind of country work. 'hey mea-
fured the portions of land allotted to each
renter. They had the custody of the Tanks, or
public reservoirs of water, without a regular
cirribution of which, the fields in a torrid
climate cannot be rendered fertile. They mark-
ed out the course of the high-ways, along
which, at great distances, they erected flones,
to measure the road and direct travellers'. To
cr. cers of a second class was committed the in-
; e$ion of the police in cities, and their funci-

priated houses for the recepLio:i of .:l es;
they proteded them fro:n iiury, provilJ for
their subsistence, and, when s'eied with any
disease, they appointed physicians to attend
them; and, on the event of their death, they
not only buried them with decency, but took
charge of their effets, and retored them to
their relations. They kept exa t reifters of
births and of deaths. They viited the public
markets, and examined weights and measures.
The third class of oficers superintended the
military department; but, as the objects to
which their attention was directed are foreign
from the subject of my inquiries, it is unne-
ceffary to enter into any detail with refpe to
them '.

As manners and cultoms in India descend al-

molt without variation from age to age, many
of the peculiar inltitutions which I have enu-
merated still fubfill there. There is still the
fame attention to the conftrudion and preferva-
tion of tanks, and the diltribution of their
waters. The direction of roads, and placing
stones along them, is ill an object of police.
Choultries, or houses built for the accommoda-
tion of travellers, are frequent in every part of
the country, and are useful as well as noble mo-
numents of Indian munificence and humanitv.
It is only among men in the molt improved fate
of society, and under the belt forms of govern-
ment, that we discover institutions finilar to
those which I have described; and many na-
tions have advanced far in their progress, with-

Ill. IN estimating the progress which any na-

tion has made in civilization, the objet that
merits the greateil degree of attention, next to
its political contitution, is the spirit of the
laws and nature of the forms by which its ju-
dicial proceedings are regulated. In the early
and rude ages of society, the few disputes with
refpea to property which arise, are terminated
by the interposition of the old men, or by the
authority of the chiefs in every small tribe or
community; their decisions are ditated by
their own discretion, or founded on plain and
obvious maxims of equity. But as controver.
fies multiply, cafes similar to such as have been
formerly determined muit recur, and the awards
upon these grow gradually into precedents,
which serve to regulate future judgments.
Thus, long before the nature of property is de-
fined by positive statutes, or any rules prescribed
concerning the mode of acquiring or conveying
it, there is gradually formed, in every Ifate, a
body of cutomary or common law, by which
judicial proceedings are directed, and every de-
cifion conformable to it is ubmitted to with re-
verence, as the result of the accumulated wis-
dom and experience of ages.

IN this (tate the administration ofjuftice seems

to have been in India when first visited by Eu-
ropeans. Though the Indians, according to
their account, had no written laws, but deter-
mined every controverted point, by recollecting
what had been formerly decided'; thcv afert,

time of legathenes, no Gree!i or Roman of
any note appears to have resided long enough
in the country, or to have been so much ac-
quainted with the cuftons of the natives, as to
be capable of entering into any detail with
refpe& to a point of so much importance in
their policy. Fortunately, the defets of their
information have been amply fupplie by the
more accurate arid extensive researches of the
moderns. During the course of almost three
centuries, the number of persons who have re-
forted from Europe to India has been great.
Many of them, who have remained long in the
country, and were persons of liberal educa-
tion and enlarged minds, have lived in uch fa-
miliar intercourse with the natives, and acquired
so competent a knowledge of their languages,
as enabled them to oblerve their institutions
with attention, and to describe them with fide-
lity. Refpetable as their authority may be,
I hall not, in what I offer for illustrating the
judicial proceedings of the Hindoos, reft upon
it alone, but hall derive my information from
sources higher and more pure.

TOWARDS the middle of the sixteenth cen-

tury, Akber the sixth, in descent from Taamer-
lane, mounted the throne of Indoltan. He is
one of the few sovereigns intitled to the appella-
tion both of Great and Gooi, and the only one

every p;,

.:;c- of his extensive dominions, the

Hindos, tre3 t l h great ody of his fubjeas,
he laboured to acquire a perlea knowledge of
their religion, their iciences, their laws and in.
ftitutions; in order that he might conduct
every part of his-government, particularly the
adtainiftratian of justice, in a manner as much
accommodated as poflible to their own ideas .
In this generous undertaking he was seconded
with zeal by his vizier Abul Fazel, a minister
whose underltanding was not less enlightened
than that of his master. By their assiduous re-
searches, and consultation of learned men',
such information was obtained as enabled Abul
Fazel to publish a brief compendium of Hindoo
jurisprudence in the Ayeen Akbery', which
may be confidered as the first genuine commu-
nication of its principles to persons of a differ-
ent relitsion. About two centuries afterwards,
the illuttrious example of Akber was imitated
and urpaffed by Mr. Ilaftings, the Governor
General of the Britifil Settlements in India.
By his authority, and under his inspection, the
most eminent Pundits, or Brahmins learned in
the la-s, of the provinces over which he pre-
fided, were affletbled at Calcutta; and, in the
cour:e or two years, compiled, from their molt
ancient and approved authors, sentence by fen-
tencc, without addition or diminution, a full
code of Hindoo laws ; which is, undoubtedly,
the molt valuable and authentic elucidation of

Indian

Indian policy and manners that has been hitherto
communicated to Europe.

ACCORDING to the Pundits, some of the

writers upon whose authority they found the
decrees which they have inserted in the Code,
lived several millions of -years before their
time b; and they boast of having a succession of
expounders of their laws from that period to
the present. Without entering into any exa-
mination of what is so extravagant, we mny
conclude, that the Hindoos have in their poflef-
sion treatises concerning the laws a-d jurifpru-
dence of their country, of more remote anti-
quity than are to be found in any other nation.
The truth of this depends not upon their own
testimony alone, but it is put beyond doubt by
one circumstance, that all thcfe treatises are
written in the Sanfkreet language, which has
not been spoken for many ages in any part of
Indoftan, and is now underflood by none but
the moltlearned Brahmins. That the Hindoos
were a people highly civilized, at the time when
their laws were composed, is molt clearly ella-
blifhed by internal evidence contained in the
Code itself. Among nations beginning to e-
merge from barbarism, the regulations of law
are extremely simple, and applicable only to a
few obvious cafes of daily occurrence. Men
must have been long united in a social slate,
their tranfacions must have been numerous and
complex, and judges muff have determined an
immense variety of controversies to which thele
give rife, before the system of law becomes so
voluminous and comprehensive as to direct the
judicial proceedings of a nation far advanced in
improvement. In that early age of the Roman

were promrntlgated, nothing more was required

for reia:ing th d ci:ions of courts of juflice;
but, ini a la;cr period, the body of civil law,
ample as its contents are, was found hardly luf.
ficient lor that ;.urpo:e. To the jejune b!evity
of the Twelve Tables, the Hindoo Code has no
resemblance, but ith refpec to the number
and variety of points it confiders, it will bear
a comparison with the celebrated digest of Jus-
tinian; or with the I'Yvems of jurisprudence in
naticns rrot highly civiiized. The articles of
which the Hindoo Code is compoed, are ar-
ranged in natural and luminous order. They
are nume-^.s and ccmprehenfive, and invests-
g:ted with that minute attention and discern-
mrcnt mhich are natural to a people diflinguifhed
for acrttcnefs and iult;litv of underltanding,
who hat. been lorg acquaiiited with all the re-

regard to adventurers at sea; an exception

"which the sense of mankind approves, and
"which commerce absolutely requires, though
" it was not before the reign of Charles I. that

likewise worthy of notice, that though the na-
tives of India have been diftlnguifhed in every
age for the humanity and mildness of their dif.
ptfition, yet such is the solicitude of their law-
givers to preserve the order and tranquillity of
society, that the punilhments which they infli&
on criminals, are (agreeable to an observation
of the ancients already mentioned) extremely
rigorous. " Punishment (according to a trik-
"ing personification in the Hindoo code) is
" the magistrate; punishment is the inspirer of
" terror; punishment is the nourisher of the
" fubjets; puniflinent is the defender from
"calamity; punishment is the guardian of

IV. As the condition of the ancient inha-

bitants of India, whether we confider them as
individuals, or as members of society, appears,
from the preceding investigation, to have been
extremely favourable to the cultivation of ue-
ful and elegant arts; we are naturally led to
enquire, whether the progress which they atu-

ally

263

ally made in them, was such as might have been
expected from a people in that lituation. In
attemptinc to tr..ce this progress, we have not
the bneft cos guidance equal to that which con-
ducted our rclrirrches concerning the former
articles of eq :y. The ancients, from their
slender acquaintance with the interior state of
India, have been able to communicate little in-
formation with refpec to the arts cultivated
there; and thou:h the moderns, during their
continued iertourle with India for three cen-
turies, have had access to observe them with
greater attention, it is of late only, that by
studying the languages now and formerly spoken
in India, and by conliultin and translating their
moil remincnt au'hcr;, thci have begun to ente
into tat path of erquiry which leads with cer-
taintv to a thorugh knowledge of the state of
arts cu!:i atcd in -th- ccuntry.

O.r of the first arts which human ingenuity
in-cd a: impreving, beyord what mere neceflity
requires, a.s that of building. In the brief
rinarks xx hich the fubtct of my inquiries leads
me to make on the progress of this art in India,
1 f:hlal conlfie my attention wholly to those of
higheii ai:tiqui:v. 'Ihe minc durable monu-
ments of human industry are public buildings.
The prcduc icns of art, formed for the com-
mon urpoles of life, afte and perilh in using
them: but xcrks dcftined for the benefit of
pc;Lrit\ :ubfift through ages, and it is accord-
i; t t ranlner in which thele are executed,
tlia e Itim a judgment with refpecl to the de-
gree of pu, 'el, ikill, and improvement to which
the Scop:e by whom :heyv were direced had at-
tairnd. in every part or India monuments of
hih antiquity a:e found. These are of two
kiids, luch a were conlecrated to the offices of

religion,

religion, or fortresses built for the security of the
country. In the former of there, to which
Europeans, whatever their ftruture may be,
give the general name of Pagodas, we may ob-
lerve a diversity of Itile, which both marks the
gradual progress of architecture, and throws
light on the general irate of arts and manners
in different periods. The most early Pagodas
appear to have been nothing more than exca-
vations in mountainous parts of the country,
formed probably in imitation of the natural ca-
verns to which the firif inhabitants of the earth
retired for safety during the night, and where
they found shelter from the inclemency of the
fealons. The moit celebrated, and, as there
is retion to believe, the most ancient of all
theie, is the Pagoda in the island Elephanta, at
no great distance from Bombay. It has been
hewn by the hands of nan out of a solid rock,
about half way up a high mountain, and formed
into a Ipacious area, nearly 120 feet lquare. In
order to lutport the l oo, and the weight of the
mountain that lies aove it, a number of nafly
pillars, and of a form not ineltgant, have been
cut out (of the liIne reck, at luch regular dif-
tances, as en the firit entrance presents to the
eye of the ipeciator an apFearance both of
beauty and of firengtlh. Grtat part of the in-
fide is covered with human tigures in high re-
lief, of gigantic size as ell as singular forms,
and clifinguilhcd b a variety of symbols, re-
priecnting, it is probable, the attributes of the
deities \\ horn they worshipped, or the actions of
the heroes whom they admired. In the isle of
Salfette, flill nearer to Bombay, are excavations
in a imilar tfile, hrdly inierior in magnifi-
cence, and dclined fcr ti:e fame religious pur-

TIIeIs. rO:`tF~~~~~~~~~~iasr

THESE itupendous works are of such high

ant'quity, that as the natives cannot, either
from history or tradition, give any information
concerning the time in which they were exe.
cuted, they universally acribe the formation of
them to the power of superior beings. From
the extent and grandeur of these subterraneous
mansions, which intelligent travellers compare
to the most celebrated monuments of human
power and art in any part of the earth, it is
manifest that they could not have been formed
in that Rage of social life where men continue
divided into small tribes, unaccustomed to the
efforts of persevering industry. It is only in
States of considerable extent, and among peo-
ple long habituated to subordination, and to as
with concert, that the idea of such magnificent
works is conceived, or the power of accomplish.
ing them can be found.

THA T some such powerful state was establish-

ed in India at the time when the excavations in
the ilands of Elephanta and Salfette were
formed, is not the only conclusion to be
drawn from a survey of them; the 'tile in which
the sculptures with which they ae adorned is
executed, indicates a considerable improvement
in art at that early period. Sculpture is the
imitative art in which man seems to have made
the firit trial of his own talents. But even in
those countries where it has attained to the
highelt degree of perfection, its progress has
been extremely flow. Whoever has attended
to the hifltry of this art in Greece, knows how
far removed the firit rude essay to represent the
hunman form, was from any complete delinea-
t;.;n of it . But the different groupes of figures

which flill remain entire in the Pagoda of Ele.
phanta, however low they must rank if they be
compared with the more elegant works of Gre-
cian or even Etruscan artists, are finished in a
stile confideralbly superior to the hard inex-
preffive manner of the Egyptians, or the figures
in the celebrated palace of Persepolis. In this
light they have appeared to persons abundantly
qualified to appretiate their merit, and from
different drawings, particularly those of Nie-
buhr, a traveller equally accurate in observing,
and faithful in describing, we mull form a fa-
vourable opinion of the Itate of arts in India at
that period.

IT is worthy of notice, that although several

of the figures in the caverns at Elephanta be so
different from those now exhibited in the Pago-
'as as objects of veneration, that some learned
Europeans have imagined they represent the
rites of a religion more ancient than that now
eltablifhed in Indoftan, yet by the Hindoos
thenmfelves the caverns re confidered as hallow-
ed places of their own worfbip, and they still
retort thither to perform their devotions, and
honour the figures there in the fame manner
with those in their own Pagodas. In confirma-
tion of this, I have been informed by an intelli-
gent peroln, who visited this subterraneous
fanduary in the year 1782, that he was accom-
panied by a sagacious rahmin, a native of Be-
nares, who, though he had never been in it
before that time, was well acquainted with the
parentage, education, and life of every deity
or hui,an figure there represented, and explain-
ed with fluency the meaning of the various sym-
bols by which the images were dillinguifhed.
This may be confidered as a clear proof that
the fyllem of mythology now prevalent in Be-

nares,

267

nares, is not different from that delineated in
the caverns of Elephanta. Mr. Hunter, who
visited Elephanta in the year 1784, seems to
confider the figures there as representing deities
who are still objeds of worship among the Hin-
doos f. One circumstance serves to confirm the
jultnefs of this opinion. Several of the molt
conspicuous personages in the groupes at Ele-
phanta are decorated with the Zennar, the fa-
cred firing or cord peculiar to the order of
Brahmins, an authentic evidence of the diftinc-
tion of cals having been established in India at
the time when thele works were finished.

2. INSTEAD of caverns, the original places

of worship, which could be formed only in
particular situations, the devotion of the people
soon began to raise temples in honour of their
deities in other parts of India. 'l he firudure
of there was at first extremely simple. They
were pyramids of large dimension, and had no
light within but what came from a small door.
After having been long accustomed to perform
all the rites of religion in the gloom of caverns,
the Indians were naturally led to confider the
solemn darkness of such a mansion as sacred.
Some Pagodas in this first stile of building fill
remain in Indcllan. Drawings of two of these
at Deogur, and of a third near Tanjore in the
Carnatic, all fabrics of great antiquity, have
been published by Mr. Hodges , and though
they are rude ftrucures, they are of such mag-
nitude as must have required the power of some
considerable ate to rear them.

268

finement, the ftrudure of their temples gradu-
ally improved. From plain buildings they be-
came highly ornamented fabrics, and, both by
their extent and magnificence, are monuments
of the power and taste of the people by whom
they were ereted. In this highly finished flile
there are Pagodas of great antiquity in different
parts of Indoftan, particularly in the Southern
provinces, which were not exposed to the de-
firuCtive violence of Mahomedan zeal . In
order to allift my readers in forming such an
idea of these buildings as may enable them to
judge with refpet to the early tfate of arts in
India, I hall briefly describe two, of which we
have the most accurate accounts. The entry to
the Pagoda of Chillambrum, near Porto Novo,
on the Coromandel coast, held in high venera-
tion on account of its antiquity, is by a flately
gate under a pyramid an hundred and twenty-
two feet in height, built with large stones above
forty feet long, and more than five feet square,
and all covered with plates of copper, adorned
with an immense variety of figures neatly exe-
cuted. he whole iructure extends one thou-
sand three hundred and thirty-two feet in one
direction, and nine hundred and thirty-fix in
another. Some of the ornamental parts are
finihed with an elegance intitled to the admira-
tion of the most ingenious artiis'. The Pa-
goda of Seringham, superior in fan ity to that
of Chillambrum, surpasses it as much in gran-
deur; and, fortunately, I can convey a more
perfect idea of it by adopting the words of an
elegant and accuratehiftorian. This Pagoda is
situated about a mile from the western extremity
of the island of Seringham, formed by the di-

viilon of the great river Caveri into two chan.
nels. " It is composed of seven square inclo-
"fures, one within the other, the walls of
"which are twenty-five feet high, and four
"thick. Thele inclofures are three hundred
"and fifty feet di:tant from one another, and
"each has four large gates with a high tower;
"which are placed, one in the middle of each
"fide of the inclofure, and opposite to the four
"cardinal points. The outward wall is near
"four miles in circumference, and its gate-way
"to the south i; ornamented with pillars,
"several of which are single stones thirty-three
" feet long, and nearly five in diameter; and
" those which form the roof are still larger:
"in the inmnot inclofures are the chapels.
" About half a mile to the East of Seringham,
"and nearer to the Caveri than the Coleroon,
"is another large Pagoda, called Jembikifma,
"but this has only one inclofure. The ex
" treme veneration in which Seringham is held
" arises from a belief that it contains that iden-

tical image of the god Wiftchnu, which used
"to be worshipped by the god Brahma. Pil.

grims from all parts of the peninsula come
here to obtain absolution, and none come
i' wikhout an offering of money; and a large

"part of the revenue of the island is allotted
"for the maintenance of the Brahmins who in-
' habit the Pagoda; and these, with their fa-
" milies, formerly composed a multitude not

less than forty thousand fouls, maintained,

"without labour, by the liberality of super-
" fition. Here, as in all the other great Pa-
"godas of India, the Brahmins live in a lub-
" ordination which knows no refitance, and
" slumber in a voluptuoufnefs which knows no

wants ."

T'HE other species of public buildings which

I mentioned, were those ereted for the defence
of the country. From the immense plains of
Indoflan there arise, in different parts, eminen-
ces and rocks formed by nature to be places of
strength. Of these the natives early took pof-
session, and fortifying them with works of va-
rious kinds rendered them almolt impregnable
tfations. There seems to have been in ome
distant age, a period of general turbulence and
danger in India, when such retreats were deem-
ed essentially necessary to public safety; for
among the duties of magistrates prescribed by
the Pundits, one is, " that he shall ered a firong
" fort in the place where he chufes to reside;
" and shall build a wall on all the four fides of
" it, with towers and battlements, and lhall
" make a full ditch around it'." Of these for-
tresses several remain, which, both from the ap-
pearance of the buildings, and from the tra-
dition of the natives, must have been conftrut-
ed in very remote times. Mr. Hodges has pub-
lifhed views of three of there, one of Chunar
Gur, situated upon the river Ganges, about fix-
teen miles above the city of Benares ; the
second, of Gwallior, about eighteen miles to
the south of Agra"; the third of Bidjegur, in
the territory of Benares o. They are all, par-
ticularly Gwallior, works of considerable mag-
nitude and trength. The fortresses in Ben-
gal, however, are not to be compared with fe-

dous work, and so advantageously situated, that

force.

NOR is it only from surveying their public

works that we are justified in asserting the early
proficiency of the Indians in elegant and useful
arts : we are led to form the fame conclusion by
a view of those productions of their ingenuity,
which were the chief articles of their trade with
foreign nations. Of these the labours of the
Indian loom and needle have, in every age,
been the most celebrated; and fine linen is con-
jetured, with some probability, to have been
called by the ancients Sindn, from the name of
the river Inlus or Sindus, near which it was
wrought in the highest perfecion . The cot-
ton manufactures of India seem anciently to
have been as much admired as they are at pre-
sent, not only for their delicate texture, but for
the elegance with which some of them are em-
broidered, and the beautiful colour of the
towers with which others are adorned. From
the earliest period of European intercourse with
India, th t country has been diltinguifhed for
the number and excellence of the substances
for dying various colours, with which it abound-
ed'. The de of the deep blue colour in
highest estimation among the Romans bore the
name of Indic'un'. From India too, the sub-
fiance used in dying a bright red colour, eems
to have been imported ; and it is well known
that both in the cotton and silk stuffs which we

now receive from India, the blue and the red
are the colours of most conspicuous lustre and
beauty. But however much the ancients may
have admired these produtions of Indian art,
some circumstances, which I have already men-
tioned, rendered their demand for the cotton
manufacures of India, far inferior to that of
modern times; and this has occasioned the in-
formation concerning them which we receive
from the Greek and Roman writers to be very
imperfet. We may conclude, however, from
the wonderful resemblance of the ancient Itate
of India to the modern, that, in every perk)d,
the productions of their looms were as various
as beautiful. The ingenuity of the Indians in
other kinds of workmanship, particularly in
metals and in ivory, is mentioned with praise
by ancient authors, but without any particular
description of their nature . Of these early
productions of Indian artists, there are now
some specimens in Europe, from which it ap-
pears that they were acquainted with the me-
thod of engraving upon the hardest tones and
gems ; and, both in the elegance of their de-
signs and in neatness of execution, had ar-
rived at a considerable degree of excellence.
An ingenious writer maintains, that the art of
engraving on gems was probably an Indian
invention, and certainly was early improved
there, and he supports this opinion by several
plausible arguments'. The Indian engraved
gems, of which he has published descriptions,
appear to be the workmanship of a very remote
period, as the legends on them are in the San-
fkreet language Y.

Bu r it is not only from the improved slate

of mechanic arts in India, that we conclude its
inhabitants to have been highly civilized; a
proof of this, still more convincing, may be
deduced from the early and extraordinary pro-
dution; of their genius in the fine arts. This
evidence is rendered more interefRing, by being
derived from a source of knowledge which the
laudable criofity of our countrymen has open-
ed to the people of Europe within these few
years. That all the science and literature pof-
iflTed by the Brahmins, were contained in books
writen in a language, understood by a few only
of the iifft learned among them, is a saC
which has long been known; and all the Eu-
ropeans fettled in India during three centuries,
have complained that the Brahmins absolutely
refused to inltruct any person in this language.
But at length, by address, mild treatment, and
a persuasion, that the earneitnefs with which
inilru&ion was solicited, proceeded not from
any intention of turning their religion into de-
rifion, but from a desire of acquiring a perfet
knowledge of their sciences and literature, their
fcrples have been overcome. Several British
gentlemen are now conpletely matters of the
San:mreet language. The mylterious veil, for-
merly deemed impenetrable, is removed; and,
in the course of five years, the curiosity of the
public has been gratified by two publications as
singular as they were unexpeeted. The one is a
tranllation, by Mr. Wilkins, of an Episode
from the Alababarat, an Epic poem, in high
efimnation among the Hindoos, composed, ac-
cording to their account, by Kreethna Dwypa-
yen Veias, the most eminent of all their Brah-
mins, above three thousand years before the
Christian era. The other is Sactntala, a drama-
tic poem, written about a century before the

I birth

birth of Christ, translated by Sir William Jones.
I ihall endeavour to give my readers such a view
of the subjet and composition of each of there,
as may enable them to estimate the degree of
merit which they possess.

THE Mahabarat is a voluminous poem, con-

silting of upwards of four hundred thousand
lines. Mr. Wilkins has tranflaed more than a
third of it; but only a hort episode, intitled
Baghvat-Geeta, is hitherto published, and from
this specimen we mut form an opinion with re-
fpet to the whole. The subjea of he poem is a fa-
mous civil war between two branches of the
royal house of Bhaurat. When the forces on
each fide were formed in the field, and ready to
decide the contest by the sword, Arjoon, the
favourite and pupil of the god Kr efhna, who
accompanied him in this hour of danger, re-
quested of him to cause his chariot to advance
between the two hostile armies. He looked at
both armies, and beheld, on either fide, none
but grandsires, uncles, cousins. tutors, sons,
and brothers, near relations or bosom friends;
and when he had gazed for a while, and saw
these prepared for the fight, he was seized with
extreme pity and compuntion, and uttered his
sorrow in the following words :-" Having be-
" held, O Kree/hna ! my kindred thus waiting
" anxious for the fight, my members fail me,
" my countenance withereth, the hair tfandeth
"an end upon my body, and all my frame
" trembleth with horror ! Even Gandeev, my
"bow, efcapeth from my hand, and my ikin
"is perched and dried up,-When I have de-
" troyed my kindred, hall I longer look for
"happiness ? I with not for vitory, Kree/hna;
"1 want not dominion; I want not plealure;
"for what is doninion and the enjoyments of

T a " life,

'do;ninion, plea:ure, and enjoyment were to

be coveted, have abandoned life and for-

'; tune, and Itand here in the field ready for the
" battle. Tutors, sons, and fathers, grandires
"and grandsons, uncles, nephews, couflns,
" kindred and friends ! Although they would
"kill me, I with not to fight them; no not
' even for the dominion of the three recions
'of the universe, much less for this little

earth ." In order to remove his scruples,

;reefhna informs him what was the duty of a
prince of the Chehteree, or military cast, when
called to at in such a situation, and incites him
to perform it by a variety of moral and philofo-
phicia arguments, the nature of which I shall
have occasion to confider particularly in aother
part f this Differtaion. In this dialogue be-
tween Kreemhna and his pupil, there are several
paTages which give an high idea ot the genius
of the poet. The speech of Arjoon I have
quoted, in which he expresses the anguih of
his foul, mudt have struck every reader as beau-
tiful and pathetic; and I fhali afterwards pro-
tuce a description of the Supreme Being, and
of the reverence here\,ith he should be wor-
fiipped, which is ublime. But while these ex-
cite our admiration, and confirm us in the be-
litf of a high degree of civilization in that
countrv where such a work was produced, we
are surprised at the defec of tarii and of art in
the m:anner of introducing this Episode. Two
powericl arniies are drawn up in battle-r.ray,
eager f r the fight; a you!,ng hero and his in-
ftruc r are delcribed ,s itandin, in a chariot

taphyfics and theology.

WrITH regard, however, both to the drama-

tic and epic poetry of the Hindoos, we labour
under the disadvantage of being obliged to form
an opinion from a finale specimen of each, and
that of the latter, too, (as it is only a part of a
large work,) an imperfect one. But if, from
such scanty materials, we may venture upon any
decision, it must be, that of the two, the drama
seems to have be;'n conducted with the molt
correct taste. This will appear from the oofer-
vations which I now proceed to make upon Sa-
contola.

IT is only to nations considerably advanced

in refinement, that the drama is a favourite en-
tertainment. The Greeks had be, n for a good
time a pclifllhd people; Alcxus and Sappho
had co.npofed their Odes, and Thales and
Anaximander had opened their schools, before
Tragedy made its firIt rude essay in the cart of
Thespis; and a good time elapsed before it at-
tained to any considerable degree of excellence.
From the drama of Sacontala, then, we must
form an advantageous idea of the state of im-
provement in that society to whose taste it was
suited. In estimating its merit, however, we
must not apply to it rules of criticifin drawn
from the literature and taste of nations with
which its author was altogether unacquainted;
we mutt not expet the unities of the Greek
theatre; we must not measure it by our own
standard of propriety. Allowance muff be
made for local cultoms, and singular manners,
arising from a state of domestic focicty, an or-
der of civil policy, and a system of religious
opinions, very different from those establishcd
in Europe. bacontala is not a regular drama,

but,

277

but, like some of the plays early exhibited on
the Spanih and English theatres, is an history
in dialogue, unfolding events which happened
in different places, and during a series of years.
Vhen viewed in this light, the fable is in ge-
neral well arranged, the incidents are happily
chosen, and the viciiitudes in the situation of
the principal personages are sudden and unex-
peced. The unravelling of the piece, how-
ever, though some of the circumstances prepara-
tory to it be introduced with kill, is at las
brought about by the intervention of superior
beings, which has always a bad effet, and dif-
covers some want of art. But as Sacontala was
descended of a celestial nymph, and under the
protection of a holy hermit, this heavenly in-
terpofition may appear less marvellous, and is
extremely agreeable to the Oriental taste. In
many places of this drama it is simple and ten-
der, in some pathetic; in others there is a
mixture of comic with what is more serious.
Of each, examples might be given. I hall
felet a few of the first, both because simplicity
and tenderness are the charaaeriftic beauties of
the piece, and because they so little resemble the
extravagant imagery and turgid style of Ori-
ental poetry.

SAco TA.LA, the heroine of the drama, a

princels of high birth, had been educated by
an holy hermit in a hallowed grove, and had
pafled the early part of her life in rural occupa-
tions and pastoral inrnocence. hen fTe was
about to quit this beloved retreat, and repair to
the court of a great monarch, to whom he had
been married, Cana, her foler-father, and
her outhiul companiors, thLs bewail their
o;n lois, and express their wilhes for her
happinrfs, in a fliain of sentiment and lan-

guage

guage perfetly suited to their pastoral cha-
rafer.

" HEAR, 0 ye trees of this hallowed forest,

"hear and proclaim that Sacontala is going to
" the palace of her wedded lord; she, who drank
"not, though thirfly, before you were wa-
"tered; he, who cropped not, through assec-
"tion for you, one of your fresh leaves, though
" Ihe would have been pleased with such an or-
"nament for her locks; she, whose chief de-
"light was in the season when your branches
"are spangled with flowers !"

"serous dust of rich blossoms. May pools of
" clear water, green with the leaves of the

" branches be her defence from the scorching
"sun-beams !"

SACONTALA, just as he was departing from

the grove, turns to Cana: " Suffer me, vene-
" rable father! to addrels this Madhavi-creeper,
" whose red blossoms inflame the grove."
-Cana. " My child I know thy affection for
' it."--Sacont. " 0 most radiant of hining

again addresses Cana: " Father ! when yon fe-

"is pregnant, hall be delivered of them, fend

-Sacont. " Why dofl thou weep, tender

in this drama of that wild extravagance so fre-
quent in Oriental poetry. The monarch, in re-
placing a bracelet which had dropped from the
arm of Sacontala, thus addresses her: "Look,
" my darling, this is the new moon which left
" the firmament in honour of superior beauty,
" and having descended on your enchanting
"wrist, hath joined both its horns round it in

the shape of a bracelet'." But this is the

speech of an enraptured young man to his
mistress, and in every age and nation exagge-
rated praise is expected from the mouth of lov-
ers. Dramatic exhibitions seem to have been a
favourite amusement of the Ilindoos as well as
of other civilized nations. " The tragedies,
" comedies, farces, and musical pieces of the
" Indian theatre, would fill as many volumes
"as that of any nation in ancient or modern
"Europe. They are all in vcrfe M-here the
"dialogue is elevated, and in prose where it is
"familiar; the men of rank and learning are
"represented speaking pure Sanfcrit, and the

women Pracrit, which is little more than the
"language of the Brahmins, melted down by a
" delicate articulation to the oftnefs of Italian;
;' while the low persons of the drama speak the
"vulgar dialecs of the several provinces which

they are supposed to inhabit ."

V. THE attainments of the Indians in science,

furnish an additional proof of their early civi-
lization. By every person who has visited In-
dia in ancient or modern times, its inhabitants,
either in tranfaftions of private business, or in
the conduct of political affairs, have been deem-
ed not inferior to the people of any nation in

sagacity, acuteness of understanding, or address.
From the application of such talents to the cul-
tivation of science, an extraordinary degree of
proficiency might have been expeced. The
Indians were, accordingly, early celebrated on
that account, and some of the most eminent of
the Greek philosophers travelled into India,
that, by converting with the fages of that coun-
try, they might acquire some portion of the
knowledge for which they were difiinguifhed -.
The accounts, however, which we receive from
the Greeks and Romans, of the sciences which
attracted the attention of the Indian philofo.
phers, or of the discoveries which they made in
them, are very imperfect. To the researches of
a few intelligent persons, who have visited India
during the course of the three last centuries,
we are indebted for more ample and authentic
information. But from the relu&tance with
which the Brahmins communicate their sciences
to frangers, and the inability of Europeans to
acquire much knowledge of them, while, like
the mysteries of their religion, they are con-
ceaied from vulgar eyes in an unknown tongue,
this information was acquired slowly and with
great difficulty. The fame observation, how.
ever, which I made concerning our knowledge
of the state of the fine arts among the people of
India, is applicable to that of their progress in
science, and the present age is the firit furnished
with sufficient evidence upon which to found
a decisive judgment with refpet to either.

ScIENCe, when viewed as disjoined from re-

ligion, the consideration of which I reserve for
another head, is employed in contemplating

exercise of our moral powers, or the nature
and qualities of external objeas. The firit is
denominated logic; the second ethics; the
third physics or the knowledge of nature.
With refped to the earlyprogrefs in cultivating
each of these sciences in India, we are in poflef-
sion of fats which merit attention.

BUT, prior to the consideration of them, it

is proper to examine the ideas of the Brahmins
with refped to mind itself, for if these were not
just, all their theories concerning its operations
must have been erroneous and fanciful. The
diflinaion between matter and spirit appears to
have been early known by the philosophers of
India, and to the latter they ascribed many
powers, of which they deemed the former to
be incapable; and when we recollet how in-
adequateour conceptions are of every objed that
does not fall under the cognizance of the senses,
we may affirm (if allowance be made for a pe-
culiar notion of the Hindoos which hall be as-
terwards explained) that no description of the
human foul is more suited to the dignity of
its nature than that given by the author of the
Mahabarat. " Some," fays he, " regard the
" foul as a wonder, others hear of it with afto-
" niflment, but no one knoweth it. The wea-
"pon divideth it not; the fire burneth it not;
"the water corrupteth it not; the wind drieth
"it not away; for it is indivisible, inconfuma-
"ble, incorruptible; it is eternal, universal,
"permanent, immovable; it is invisible, in-
"conceivable, and unalterable'." After this
view of the entiments of the Brahmins con.
cerning mind itself, we may proceed to confider
their ideas with refpea to each of the ciences,

lit, LOG:c, and Metaphysics. On no sub.

jed has the human underitanding been more ex.
ercifed than in analysing its own operations.
The various powers of the mind have been ex.
amined and defined. The origin and progress
of our ideas have been traced; and proper rules
have been prescribed, of proceeding from the
observation of facts to the establishment of prin.
cipies, or from the knowledge of principles to
form arrangements of science. The philofo-
rphrs of ancient Greece were highly celebrated
ibr their proficiency in these abstruse Ipecula-
tions; and, in their discussions and arra.ngt-
ments, discovered such depth of thought, a:d
acuteness of discernment, that their fyltems of
Logic, particularly that of the Peripatetick
School, have been deemed most diltinguifhed
efforts of human reason.

BrT since we became acquainted, in some

decree, with the literature and fcitnce of the
Hindoos, we find that as soon as men arrive at
that sage in social life, when they can turn
their attention to speculative inquiries, the hu-
man mind will, m every region of the earth,
di.fpiav nearly the fame powers, and proceed in
its inveititions and discoveries by nearly limi.

many passages inthe Baghvat-Geeta, it appears
that the fame speculations which occupied the
philosophers of Greece had engaged the atten-
tion of the Indian Brahmins; and the theories
of the former, either concerning the qualities
of external objecs, or the nature of their own
ideas, were not more ingenious than those of the
latter. To define with accuracy, to diltinguifh
with acuteness, and to reason with subtlety, are
characteriltics of both; and in both, the fame
excess of refinement, in attempting to analyse
those operations of mind which the faculties of
man were not formed to comprehend, led some-
times to the molt false and dangerous conclufi-
ons. That sceptical philosophy, which denies
the existence of the material world, and asserts
nothing to be real but our own ideas, seems to
have been known in India as well as in Europe ;
and the fages of the East, as they were indebted
to philosophy for the knowledge of many im-
portant truths, were not more exempt than
those of the Wcit from its delusions and er-
rors.

its oljct, to ascertain what diftinguiffes virtue
from vice, to investigate what motives hould
prompt men to at, and to prescribe rules for
the conduct of life, as it is of all other the molt
interesting, seems to have deeply engaged the
attention of the Brahm'ns. 'heir sentiments
with reipet to there points are various, and,
like the philolophers of Greece, the Brahmins
were divideu into sets, diftinguifled by max-
ims and tenets often diametrically opposite.

nately, best acquainted, had established a fyRlem
of morals, founded on principles the most ge.
nerous and dignified which unassisted reason is
capable of discovering. Man, they taught, was
formed, not for speculation or indolence, but
for action. He is born, not for himself alone,
but for his fellow men. The happiness of the
society of which he is a member, the good of
mankind, are his ultimate and highest objets.
In chufing what to prefer or reject, the justness
and propriety of his choice are the only confi.
derations to which he should attend. The events
which may follow his aions are not in his own
power, and whether they be prosperous or ad.
verse, as long as he is satisfied with the purity
of the motives which induced him to acd, he
can enjoy that approbation of his own mind,
which constitutes genuine happiness, indepen.
dent of the power of fortune or the opinions of
other men. " Man (fays the author of the Ma.
"habarat) enjoyeth not freedom from aion.
"Every man is involuntarily urged to a by

FROM these, and other passages which I have

quoted, we learn that the diftinguilhed docrines
of the Stoical School were taught in India
many ages before the birth of Zeno, and incul.
cated with a persuasive earnestness nearly re-
fembling that of Epicetus; and it is not with-
out aftoniihment that we find the tenets of this
manly ative philosophy, which seem to be
formed only for men of the mofl vigorous fpi-
rit, prescribed as the rule of condut to a race
of people more eminent for the gentleness of
their disposition than for the elevation of their
minds.

3d, PHYSICS. In all the sciences which con-

tribute towards extending our knowledge of
nature, in mathematics, mechanics, and aftro-
nomy, Arithmetic is of elementary use. In
whatever country then we find that such atten-
tion has been paid to the improvement of arith-
metic as to render its operations most easy and
corret, we may presume that the sciences de-
pending upon.it have attained a superior degree

A Baghvat-Gcta, p. 4o

of

287

of perfection. Such improvement of this fci-
ence we find in India. While, among the
Greeks and Romans, the only method used for
the notation of numbers was by the letters of
the alphabet, which neceflarily rendered arith-
metical calculations extremely tedious and ope-
rose, the Indians had, from time immemorial,
employed for the fame purpose the ten cyphers,
or figures, now universally known, and bv
means of them performed every operation in
arithmetic with the greatest facility and expe-
dition. By the happy invention of giving a
different value to each figure according to its
change of place, no more than ten figures are
needed in calculations the molt complex, and
of any given extent; and arithmetic is the molt
perfec of all the sciences. The Arabians, not
long after their settlement in Spain, introduced
this mode of notation into Europe, and were
candid enough to acknowledge that they had de-
rived the knowledge of it from the Indians.
Though the advantages of this mode of nota-
tion are obvious and great, yet so lowly do
mankind adopt new inventions, that the use of
it was for some time confined to cience; by de-
grees, however, men relinquished the former
cumbersome method of computation by letters,
and the Indian arithmetic came into general use

which they ftadied the m)tions of the heaven!y

Romans that it is hardly mentioned by th-n
but in the most curforv inanner '. But as lonn
as the Mahomedm.s etablilhed an intercourse
with the natives of India, they observed and ce-
lebrated the fuperioritv of their astronomical
knowledge. Of the Europeans who visited In-
dia after the communication with it by the Cape
of Good Hope was discovered, M. Bernier, an
inquisitive and philosophical traveller, was one
of the first who learned that the Indians had
long applied to the study of atronomy, and
had made considerable progress in that science °.
His information, however, seems to have been
very general and imperfect. We are indebted
for the first scientific proof of the great profici-
ency of the Indians in astronomical knowledge,
to M. de la Loubere, who, on his return from his
embassy to Siam, brought with him an extract
from a Siamese manuscript, which contained
tables and rules for calculating the places of the
fun and moon. The manner in which these ta-
bles were conitrufed rendered the principles on
which they were foundt extremely obscure,
and it required a commentator as conversant in
astronomical calculation as the celebrated Caf-
fini, to explain the meaning of this curious
fragment. The epoch of the Siamese tables
corresponds to the 21 it of March, A. D. 638.
Another set of tables was tranlfnitted from
Chrifnabouram, in the Carnatic, the epoch of
which answers to the tenth of March, A. D.
1491. A third et of tables came from Narfa-
pour, and the epoch of them goes no farther
back than A. D. 1569. The fourth and most

IT may be confidered as a general result of all

the inquiries, reasonings, and calculations,
with refped to Indian atronoiny, which have
hitherto been made public, " That the motion
"of the heavenly bodies, and more particularly
"their ituation-at the commencement of the dif-
"ferent epochs to which the four sets of tables
"refer, are ascertained with great accuracy;
"and that many of the elements of their cal-
" culations, especially for very remote ages,
"are verified by an aftonilhing coincidence
"with the tables of the modern atronomy of
"Europe, when improved by the latest and most
"nice deducions from the theory of gravita-
"tion." These conclusions are rendered pecu-
liarly interesting, by the evidence which they
afford of an advancement in science unexampled
in the history of rude nations. The Indian
Brahmins, who annually circulate a kind of al-
manack, containing atronomical predictions of
some of the more remarkable phenomena in the
heavens, such as the new and full moons, the
eclipses of the fun and moon, are in pofleflion
of certain methods of calculation, which, upon
examination, are found to involve in them a
very extensive system of atrcnomical know-
ledge. M. le Gentil, a French aftrcnoner,
had an opportunity, while in India, of cbferv-
ing two eclipses of the moon, which had been
calculated by a Brahmin, and he found the er-
ror in either to be very incoiideraLle.

THE accuracy of these rcfults is ilfs urprifing

than the jufi.nels and scientific nature of the
principles on which the tables, by which they
calculate, are conitrucd. For the method of
prediting eclipses which is followed by the
Brahmins, is of a kind altogether diTerent from
any that has been found in the poffeiion! of rude

these tables (as was formerly obfcrve.l) profess
to ie as old as the beginning of the Calx (luha:n,
or to go back to the y3ar i oz before the Chris-
tian era; but as nothing (it Imay be lupioled)
is easier than for an altronomcr to give to his
tables what date he plea'es, and, by calculating
backwards, to eftablifl an epoch of any ailined
antiquity, the pretensions of the Indian altrollo-
my to so remote an origin are not to be admitted
without examination.

THAT examination has accordiing l been in-
tfituted by M. Baiiiy, and the result of his
inquiries is asserted to be, that the atronomy
of India is founded on ob:ervation which cin-
not be of a much later date th.l the pet, od
above mentioned. For the Indi in tables repre-
sent the Itate of the heavens at hat period with
altonifhin exacnefs; and there is between
them and the calculations of our N-odcrn atro-
nomy such a conformity, with rc('pect to th-,re
ages, as could re'ult from nothing, blit from the
authors of the former having accurately cope:d
from nature, and having delineated truly the
face of the heavens, in the age wherein thev
lived. In order to give some idea of the i h
degree of accuracy in the Indian ta: les, I fliail
felec a few inliances of it, out es n:aun ti-at
might be produced. The place of the fun for
the astronomical epoch at the beginning of the
Calyougham, as fiated in the tables of 'I irvalore,
is only forty-feven minutes greater than by the
tables of M. de la Caille, when corrected bv the
calculations of M. le (range. The pl.:ce of the
moon, in the fame tables, for the lame epoch,
is only thirty-feven minutes different from the
tables of Mayer. The tables of Ptolemy, for
that epoch, are erroneous no less than ten de-
grees with refpec to the place of the fun, and

eleven

293

eleven degrees with refpet to that of the moon.
The acceleration of the moon's motion, reck-
oning from the beginning of the Calyougham
to the present time, agrees, in the Indian ta-
bles, with those of Mayer to a single minute.
The inequality of the fun's motion, and the
obliquity of the ecliptic, which were both
greater in former ages than they are now, as
represented in the tables of T'irvalore, are ai-
most of the precise quantity that the theory of
gravitation afigns to them three thousand years
before the Christian era. It is accordingly for
those very remote ages (about 5coo years di-
tant from the present that their astronomy is
most accurate, and the nearer we come down to
our own times, the conformity of its results
with ours diminishes. It seems reasonable to
fuppole, that the time when its rules are moll
accurate, i the time when the observations
were made on which there rules are founded.

Is support of this conclusion, M. Bailly main-

tains that none of all the aflronomical fyflems
of Greece or Persia, or of Tartary, from some
of which it might be fufpeced that the Indian
tables were copied, can be made to agree with
them, epecially when we calculate for very re-
mote agts. The superior perfection of the In.
dian tables becomes alw-a's more conspicuous
as we go farther back into antiquity. This
shews, likewise, how difficult it is to construe
any altronomical tables, which will agree with
the state of the heavens for a period so remote
from the time the tables were conftruted, as
tour or five thousand ye;rs. It is only from
altionomy in its molt advanced state, such as it
has attained in modern Europe, that such accu-
racy is to be expected.

WHEN

WHEN an estimate is enleavoured ro be made

of the geometrical kill necessary for the con-
trucion of the Indian tables and rules, it is
found to be very considerable; and, belide the
knowledge of elementary geometry. it mult
have required a plain and fphelical trigono:ne-
try, or fonething equivalent to them, to cther
with certain methods of approximating to the
values of geometrical magnitudeis, x hich seem
to rife very far above the elements of any of
those sciences. Seme of th?fe last mark also
very clearly (although this has not been ob-
served by M. Baillv) hat the places to which
there tables are adapted, mu' be situated be-
tween the Tropics, becatiif they are altogether
inapplicable at a greater diltance from the
Equator.

FROM this long indludion, the cnnclufion

which feetns obviouflv to result is, that the In-
dian astronomy is founded upon oblervati )ns
which were made at a very early period ; and
when we confider the exact agreement of the
places which they afiign to the fun and moon,
and other heavenly bodies, at that ep.:ch, with
those deduced from the tables of De 1: Cailie
and Mayer, it itrongly confirms the trutih or the
position which I have been eudeavouri::g to es-
tablifh, concerninpg the early and high iate of
civilization in India.

BEFORE I quit this fi.bje&, there is one cir-

cumftance which merits particular attention.
All the knowledge which we have hiiihert ac-
quired of the principles and concluf,o(mn of In-
dian astronomy is derived from the louthern'
part of the Carnatic, and the tables are adapted
to places situated between the meridian of Cape
Comorin and that which passes through the

edfter .

295

eastern part of Ceylon'. The Brahmins in the
Carnatic acknowsledge that their science of aftro-
nomv was derived from the North, and that
their method of calculation is denominated
Fakilm, or New, to di.tinguifh it from the Sid-
dan:a-:, or ancient method eablifhed at Bena-
res, which they al!ow to be much more per-
sec . and we learn from Abul Fazel, that all
the aitronomers of Indoftan rely entirely upon
the precepts contained in a book called Sorcj
Sudlar.t, ccmposed in a very remote period '.
It is manifeftiv from this book that the method
to which the Brahmins of the South gave the
name of Siddantam is taken. Benares has
been from time immemorial the Athens of In.
dia, the re::dence of the molt learned Brah-
mins, and the feat both of science and litera-
ture. I here, it is highly probable, whatever
remains of the ancient afironomical knowledge
and discoveries of the Brahmins is fill preltrv.
ed'. In an enlightened age and nation, and
during a reign difiinguiflled by a fucceffon of
the most splendid ard successful undertakings to
extend the kno;ledge of nature, it is an ob.
jet v.orthv of ublic attention, to take mea-
fures for obtaining poftifiicn of all that time
has pared cf the philcicphy and inventions of
the mcf: early and moet civilized people of the
East. I: is with Feculiar advantages Great Bri-
tain rr.ay engage in this laudable undertaking.
Benares is iubject to its dominion; the confi-
dence of the Brahmins has been so far gained
as to render them communicative; some of our
countrymen are acquainted with that sacred

language in which the mysteries both of religion
and of science are recorded; movement and
activity has been given to a spirit of inquiry
throughout all the British eflablifhments in ln-
dia; persons who visited that country with other
views, though engaged in occupations of a very
different kind, are now carrying on scientific
and literary researches with ardour and success.
Nothing seems now to be wanting but that
those entrusted with the administration of the
Britifl empire in India, hould enable ome per-
son, capable, by his talents and liberality of
sentiment, of investigating and explaining the
more abstruse parts of Indian philolophy, to de-
vote his whole time to that important object.
Thus Great Britain may have the glory of ex-
ploring fully that extensive field of unknown
science, which the Academicians of France
had the merit of first opening to the people of
Europe".

VI. THE last evidence which I shall mention

of the early and high civilization of the ancient
Indians,is deduced from the consideration of their
religious tenets and practices. The institutions
of religion, publicly established in all the ex-
tensive countries stretching from the Banks of
the Indus to Cape Comorin, present to view an
afpedt nearly similar. They form a regular
and complete system of fuperflition, strength-
ened and upheld by every thing which can ex-
cite the reverence and secure the attachment of
the people. The temples, consecrated to their
deities, are magnificent, and adorned not only
with rich offerings, but with the most exquisite
works in painting and culpture, which the ar-
tifts, highest in estimation among them, wxere

capable of executing. The rites and ceremo-
nies of their worahip are pompous and splendid,
and the performance of them not only mingles
in all the transactions of common life, but con-
ftitutes an essential part of them. The Brah-
mins, who, as minilters of religion, prefidein
all its functions, are elevated abeve every other
order of men, by an origin deemed not only
more noble, but acknowledged to be lacrd.
They have established among themselves a re-
gular hierarchy and gradation of ranks, xhicl,
by securing subordination in their own order,
adds weight to their authority, and gives them
a more absolute dominion over the minds of the
people. This dominion they support by the
command of the immense revenues with which
the liberality of princes, and the zeal (of pil-
grims and devotees, have enriched their Pa-
godas .

IT is far from my intention to enter into an'

minute detail with respect to this vast and com-
plicated fytfem of luperftition. An attempt to
enumerate the multitude of deities, hich are
the objects of adoration in India; to describe
the splendour of orfhip in their Pagodas, and
the immense variety of their rites and cerenmo-
nies; to recount the various attributes and
functions which the craft of priests, or the cre-
dulity of the people, have ascribed to their di-
vinities; especially it I were to accompany all
this with a review of the numerous and often
fanciful speculations and theories of learned
men on this subject, would require a work of
great magnitude. I hall, therefore, on this, as
on some of the other heads, confine rvfelf to

view,

view, and by confidering the ltate of religion
in India, I hall endeavour not only to throw
additional light on the state of civilization in
that country, but I flatter myself that, at the
fame time, I shall be able to give what may be
confidercd as a ketch and outline of the history
and progi lls of fuperltition and alfe religion in
every region of the earth.

I. WE may obfcrve, that, in every country,

the received mytholo:'y, or system of fuperititi-
ous belief, with all the rites an: ceremonies
which it prescribes is formed in the infancy of
fociet, in rude and barbarous ines. True
religi(n is as different from fiuprllition in its
origin, as in its nature. The ormer is the
offspring of reason cherished by science, and at-
tains to its highelt perfection in ages of light
and improvement Ignorance and fear give
birth to the latter, and it is always in the darkest
periods that it acquires the greatest vigour.
That numerous part of the human species whose
lot is labour, whose principal and almost sole
occupation is to secure subsistence, has neither
leisure nor capacity for entering into that path
of intricate and refined speculation, which con-
ducs to the knowledge of the principles of ra-
tional religion. When the intelledual powers
are just beginning to unfold, and their first
feeble exertions are direced towards a few ob-
jeds of primary neceflity and use; hen the fa-
culties of the mind are so limited as not to have
formed general and abftrad ideas; when lan-
guage is so barren as to be destitute of names
to diftinguith any thing not perceivable by some
of the senses ; it is pepofterous to expec that
men hould be capable of tracing the relation
between effects and their caules; or to suppose
that they hould rile from the contemplation of

the

299

the former to the discovery of the latter, and
form ju(s conceptions of one Supreme Being,
a~ the Creator and Governor of the universe.
The idea of creation is so farmiliar. wherever
the mind is enlarged by science, and illuminated
by revelation, that we feldon reflect how pro-
found and abstruse the idea i, or confider what
prozrefs man must have mad2 in oe:rvation and
research, before he could arrive at any diitinc
knowledge of this elementary principle in re-
ligion. But even in its rude l'ate, the hunni'i
mind, formed for religion, opens to the reccp.
ticn of ideas. which are delfined, lhen cr-
rected and refined, to be the great source cf
consolation amidrtl the cAlamities of life. Th !e
aDrehenfions, hox ever, are crigin;:l!v indil-
tinct and perplexed, ad seem to be ugceled(
rather by the dread of impending evils, ih n t,
f.-v from gratitude tor bliiigs received.
\While nature holds on her courle w\ith unif',rm
and undii!urbed regularity, men enjoy the be-
nefits refultin, frcm it, ithout much inquiry
concerning its cauie. But every det i..tion frcom
this regular course roules and aftonir;Ces the:n.
When they bhold evints to xwhich they are rno
accustomed, they fcarch for the caules of thtm
wih eager criointv. Tierir u'derltndin. is
often unable to dilcover tl:fe. b:it inagina ion,
a more forwxard a:id arde.nt faculty of the mind,
decides ithout i:efititi, n. It aicri-es the ex-
traordinarv occurrences in nature to the influ-
ence of invitible beings, and luppn;os the thun-
d r, the hurricane, and earthquake, to be the
immediate eftcc of their agency. Alarmed by
these natural evils, and exposed,, at the lame
time, to many dangers and diatlltrs, hich are
unavoidable in te early and unciviiized state of
focierv, men have recourse for protection
to power iuperior to what is human, and the

firtl
3co

firfl rites or practices which bear any refem-
blance to ats of religion have it for their object
to avert evils which they susser or dread .

II. As fuper(tition and false religion take their

rife, in every country, from nearly the fame
sentiments and apprehensions, the invisible be-
ings, who are the first objets of veneration,
have every where a near resemblance. To
conceive an idea of one superintending mind,
capable of arranging and directing all the
various operations of nature, seems to be an
attainment far beyond the powers of man in
the more early stages of his progress. His
theories, more suited to the limited sphere of
his own observation, are not so refined.
He supposes that there is a distinCt cause of
every remarkable effect, and acribes to a fepa-
rate power every event which attracts his atten-
tion, or excites his terror. He fancies that it is
the province of one deity to point the lightning,
and with an awful found, to hurl the irresistible
thunderbolt at the head of the guilty; that
another rides in the whiIlwind, and, at his
pleasure, rail; s or I ills the tempest ; that a third
rules over the ocan ; that a fourth is the od
of battles; that while malevolent powers scat-
ter the lfeds of aniniofity and discord, and
kindle in the breast those angry paflions which
gixe rife to r, a, nd terminate in deftrudion,
others, of a nature more benign, by inspiring
the hearts of men with kindness and love,
itrengthen the bonds of social union, augmeiit

WITIrOUT descending farther into detail, or

attempting to enumerate the infinite multitude
of deities to which the fancy or the fears of men
have allotted the direction of the several depart-
ments in nature, we may recognise a striking
uniformity of features in the fyitems of super-
fition eftablilhed throughout every part of the
earth. The lets men have advanced beyond the
state of savage life, and the more slender their
acquaintance with the operations of nature, the
fewer were their deities in number, and the
more compendious was their theological creed;
but as their mind gradually opened, and their
knowledge continued to extend, the objecs of
their veneration multiplied, and the articles of
their faith became more numerous. This took
place remalkably among the Greeks in Europe,
and the Indians in Asia, the two people, in
those great di\ifions of the earth, who were
most early civilized, and to whom, for that
reason, I shall confine all my observations. They
believed, that over every movement in the na-
tural world, and over every function in civil
cr domestic iife, e en the most common and
trivial, a particular deity presided. The man-
ner in which they arranged the itations of these
superintending powers, and the offices which
the allotted to each, were in many refpecs the
lame. What is supposcd to be performed by
the power of Jupiter, of eun, of Eolus,
of Mars, of Venus, according to the mytho-
logy of the Welt, is acribed in the East to
tie agency of Agnee, the god of fire ; Varoon,
the god of oceans; Vayoo, the god of wind';

. GBS!ai;.-Ccta, P. 9..C

Cama,

Cama, the god of love ; and a variety of other
divinities.

THE ignorance and credulity of men having
thus peopled the heavens with imaginary beings,
they ascribed to them such qualities and ations
as they deemed suitable to their characer and
funcions. It is one of the benefits derived
from true religion, that by setting before men a
standard of perfec excellence, which they
have always in their eye, and endeavour to re-
femble, it may be said to bring down virtue
from heaven to earth, and to form the human
mind after a divine model. In fabricating
fyltems of false religion the procedure is directly
the reverse. Men ascribe to the beings whom
they have deified, such ations as they them-
selves admire and celebrate. The qualities of
the gods who are the objects of adoration, are
copied from those of the worshippers who bow
down before them; and thus many of the im-
perfections peculiar to men have found admit-
tance into heaven. Bv knowing the adven-
tures and attributes of any faife deity, we cal
pronounce, withi ftmne degree of certainty,
what mult have been the itate of ici-ty and
manners when he was elevated to that dignity.
The mythology of Greece plainly indicates the
characrer of the age in which it was formed.
It muat have been in times of the greatelt li-
centioulnefs, anarchy, and violence, that divi-
nities of the higheit rank could be uppolJd
capable of prpetra:i:ng actions, or of eiiig
influenced by palfions, which, in more enligh-
tened periods, would be deemed a diigrace to
human nature; it mull have been whk.i the
earth was still infelted with de;tructive moniirs,
and mankind, under furms of government tuo
feeble to afford them protetion, were expolk:d

to

303

to the depredations of lawle's robbers, or the
cruelty of savage oppreffrs, that the well.
known labours of Hercules, bv which he wad
raised from earth to heaven, could have been
necessary, or wou!d have been deemed to highly
meritorious. Tne fame observation is applica-
ble to the ancient mythology-of India. Many
of the adventures and exploits of the Indian
deities are suited to the rudelt ares of turbu.
lence and rapine. It was to check disorder, to
redress wrongs, and to clear the earth of power-
ful oppressors, that Vifhnou, a divinity of the
highest order, is said to have become fucceflively
incarnate, and to have appeared on earth in
various forms z.

III. THE character and functions of those

deities which superstition created to itself ai
objects of its veneration, having every where
a near resemblance, the rites of their worship
were every where extremely similar. Accord-
ingly as deities ere diltinguihed, either by
ferocity of charadcer or licentiousness of conducl,
it is bvious what services muf have been
ceemed mo:: acceptable to them. In order t)
co"ilia:e the .'avc.ur, or to app eaf the xrath,
cf the frmer, falis. mortifications, and pe-
nances, all rigid, ai.d many of them xcrui-.
ating to an extreme degree, were the means
employed. Their altars were always bathed 1:1

But reliious inftituior., and ceremonies of a
less severe kinJ, wiee more adapted to the
genius of a pople, formed, by the extreme
sensibility both of heir mental and corporeal
frame, to an immo3erate love of pleasure. In
no part of the earth was a cnnnecion between
the gratification of enfual desire and the rites
of public religion, d;Dplaved with more avowed
indecency than in India. In every Pagoda
there was a band of women set apart for the
service of the idol honoured there, and devoted
from their early year; to a life of pleasure; for
which the Brahmins prepared them by an edu-
cation which added so many elegant accomplish-
ments to their natural charms, that what they
gained by their profligacy, often brought no
inconsiderable accession to the revenue of the
temple. In every fundion performed in the
Pagodas, as well as in every public procession,
it is the office of these women to dance before
the idol, and to sing hymns in his praise; and it
is difficult to fay, whether they trespass molt
againit decency by the gestures they exhibit, or
by the verses which they recite. The walls of
the Pagoda are covered with paintings, in a stile
no lets indelicate d; and in the innermost recess
of the temple, for it would be profane to call
it the fancduary, is placed the Lingam, an em-
blem of productive power too gross to be ex-
plained .

former are received in every age and country
with unhesitating assent, by the great body of
the people, and the latter observed with icra-
pulous exatnefs. In our re:ifoings concern-
ing religious opinions and practices which differ
widely from our own, we are extremely apt to
err. Having been inltrueted ourselves il the
principles of a religion, worthy in every refped
of that divine wisdom by which they were dic-
tated, we frequently exprels wonder at the
credulity of nations in embracing rvftems of
belief which appear to us so direcly repugnant
to right reabon, and sometimes fulpect that tenets
so wil-1 and extravagant do not really gain credit
with them. But experience may satisfy us,
that neither our wonder nor suspicions are well
founded. No article of the public religion
was called in question by thore people of an-
cient Europe with whose hitory we are befi
acquainted, and no pracice which it enjoined
appeared improper to them. On the other
hand, every opinion that tended to diminish the
reverence of men for the gods of their country,
or to alienate themn from their worihip, excited
among the Gree s and Romans, that indignant
zeal which is natural to every people attached to
their religion, by a firm periuafion of its truth.
The attachment of the Indians, both in ancient
and modern times, to the tenets and rites of
their ancestors, has been, ifpoffible, dtill greater.
In no country, of which we have any account,
were precautions taken with so much olicitude,
to place the great body of the people beyond tie
reach of any temptation to doubt or dilbelief.
They not only were prevented, (as I have already
oblerved the great bulk of mankind mult always
be in every country,) from entering upon any
speculative inquiry, by the various occupatiJns
of active and laborious life, but any attempt t.

Even the hiheit C( .-s cdz,:ndedii entirely for

no portion of science but what they deigned to
communicate. B means of this, a devout
reverence was universally maintained for those
institutions which were confidered as sacred;
and, though the faith of the Hindoos has been
often tried by severe persecutions, excited by
the bigotry of their Mahomedan conquerors,
no people ever adhered with greater fidelity to
the tenets and rites of their ancestors .

V. WVE may observe, that when science and

philefophy are diflufed through any country,
the system of fuperitition is fubjeaed to a fcru-
tinv from which it was formerly exempt, and
opinions spread which imperceptibly diminith
its influence oer the minds of men. A free
and full examination is alwa s favourable to
truth, but fatal to error. What is received
with implicit faith in agcs of darkness, will
excite contempt or indignation in an enlighten-
ed period. The history of religion in Greece
and Italy, the only countries of Europe which,
in ancient times, were diitinguilhed for their

attain-

attainments in science, confirms the truth of
this oblervation. As soon as science ina.e uch
progress in Greece as rendered min cpa!l of
dicerning the wisdom, the foresight, and the
goodness displayed in creating, preserving, and
governing the world, they mut have perceived,
that the characters of the divinities which were
proposed as the objects of adoration in their
temples, could not intitle them to be confidered
as the presiding powers in nature. A poet
might addxefs Jupiter as the father of gods and
men, who governed both by eternal laws; but,
to a philosopher, the on of Saturn, the story
of whose life is a series of violent and licentious
deeds, which would render any man odious or
despicable, inuft have appeared altogether un-
worthy of that tation. The nature of the re-
ligious service celebrated in their temples mull
have been no less offensive to an enlightened
mind, than the charadcr of the deities in ho-
nour of whom it was performed. Inltead of
institutions, tending o reclaim men from vice,
to form or to strengthen habits of virtue, or to
elevate the mind to a sense of its proper dignit,
superstition either occupied its votaries in frivo-
lous unmeaning ceremonies, or prescribed rites,
which operated with fatal influence, in inflaming
the passions and corrupting the heart.

IT is with timidity, however, and caution, that

men venture to attack the cltablifhed religion
of their country, or to impugn opinions which
have been long held sacred. At first, rbme phi-
lofophers endeavoured, by allegorical interpre-
tations and refined commenics, to explain the
popular mythology, as if it had been a delcrip-
tion of the powers of nature, <;:nl ur the various
events and revolutions which take place in tle
iYftcm of the material wurld, .,d endeavouied,

by

by this exp-dient, to palliate many of its ab-
furd:r;s. Bv degrees, bolder theories concern.
ing r igion ere almitted into the schools of
science. Philosophers of enlarged views, fen-
fible of the impiety of the popular superstition,
formed ideas concerning the perfetions of one
Supreme Bein, the Creator and Ruler of the
ui;iverfe, ajuit and rational as have ever been
at:'aned by the unassisted powers of the human
mind.

IF from Europe we now turn to Asia, we

f.a!l find, h .t the oblervation which I have

frming :he f -:ians of religion, or to serve as
hrcdta.rv and ir.;creicd guardians of its tenets
and i:ntitutions. EBt in India the Brahmins
were born the minislers of religion, and they
had an exclux e right ofprefiding in all the nu-
merous rites of worniip which superstition pre-
fctlbed as necefTary to avert the wrath of Hea-
vin, or to render it propitious. These diflindi-
ens and priileges ecured to them a wonderful
a!cendant over their countrymen; and every
conafderation that can influence the human
n:ind, the honouir, the interest, the power of
their order, called upon them to support the
terets, and to maintain the institutions and

rites,
3Jo

rftes, with which the preservation of this afcen-
dant was ob intimately conneced.

BUT as the molt eminent persons of the east

devoted their lives to the cultivation of science,
the progress which they made in all the branches
of it (of which 1 have given some account) was
great, and enabled them to form such a just idea
of the system of nature, and of the power,
wisdom, and goodnesl displayed in the forma-
tion and government of it, as elevated their
minds above the popular superstition, and led
them to acknowledge and reverence one Su-
preme Being, " the Creator of all things (to use
"their own expressions), and from whom all
"things proceed ."

THIS is the idea which Abul Fazel, who ex-

amined the opinions of the Brahmins with the
greatest attention and candour, gives of their
theology. " 'They all," fays he, " believe in
"the unity of the Godhead, and although they
" hold images in high veneration, it is only be-
"cause they represent celestial beings, and pre-
" vent their thoughts from wandering'." The
sentiments of the most intelligent Europeans
who have visited India, coincide perfealy with
his, in refped to this point. The accounts which
Mr. Bernier received from the Pundits of Be-
nares, both f their external worship, and of
one Sovereign Lord being the sole object of
their devotion, is precisely the fame with that
given by Abul Fazel k. Mr. Wilkins, better
qualified perhaps than any European ever was to
judge with refped to this subjet, represents the
learned Brahmins of the present times as The-

cealed with the greatest care from the body of
the people, have been unveiled by the tranfla-
tions from the Sanfkreet language lately pub-
li(hed. The principal design of the Baghvat-
Geeta, an episode in the Mahabarat, a poem of
the highest antiquity, and of the greatest autho-
rity in India, seems to have been to establish the
doctrine of the unity of the Godhead, and
from a just view of the divine nature, to deduce
an idea of what worihip will be most acceptable
to a perfeCt Being. In it, amidit much obscure
metaphysical discussion, some ornaments of
fancy unsuited to our taste, and some thoughts
elevated to a traft of sublimity into which our
habits of judgment will find it difficult to pursue
them, we find descriptions of the Supreme
Being entitled to equal praise with those of the
Greek philosophers which I have celebrated.
Of these I hall now produce one which I for-
merly mentioned, and refer to my readers for
others to the work itself: " 0 mighty Being,"
fays Arjoon, " who art the prime Creator,
"eternal God of Gods, the World's Mansion.
"Thou art the incorruptible Being, diflinc
"from all things transient. Thou art before all
"Gods, the ancient Poc-ojq/' [i. e. vital foul],
" and the Supreme Supporter of the universe.
"Thou knoweft all things, and art worthy to
"be known; thou art the SuptemeManfion, and
"by thee, 0 infinite Form, the universe was
" spread abroad.-Reverence be unto thee be-
" ore and behind; reverence be unto thee on
" all fides; 0 thou who art all in all. Infinite
"is thy power and thy glory. Thou art the fa-
" ther of all things, animate and inanimate.
"Thou art the wife instructor of the whole,

" worthy to be aored. There is none like
" unto thee; where then, in the three worlds,
'; is tere one above thee ? Wherefore I bow
' down; and, with my body prostrate upon
" he ground, crave thy mercy, Lord ! Worthy
'; be adored ; for thou fhouldefl bear with
' ;r. even as a fa'her with his fun, a friend
' with his friend, and a lover with his be-

t' 1. '." A description of the Supreme Be-

in_ is given in one cf the sacrcd books of the
I:;::2ocs, I.-on \xhich it is evident what were
:e: general fe.;ti-nnts of the learned Brahmins
concrnig the divine nature and perfecions:
' As God is immaterial, he is above all con-
: (eption; as he is invifibie, he can have no
' form; but from what we behold of his works
'; we may conclude, that he is eternal, omnipo.
":ent, knowing all things, and present every
" where ."

To men capable of forming such ideas of the

Deity, the public service in the Pagodas mult
have appeared to be an idolatrous worship of
images, by a superstitious multiplication of fri-
volous or immoral rites; and they mulf have
seen that it was only by san&ity of heart, and
purity of manners, men could hope to gain the
approbation of a Being perfect in goodness.
This truth Veias labours to inculcate in the Ma.
ha:.-.at, but with the prudent reserve, and art-
f; prec-.ations, natural to a Brahmin, studious
..:t.er to cend his countrymen, nor to dimi-
n:: he influence tf his own order. His ideas
c .cerr.ing the mode of worlhipping the Deity,
are e:?iained in many striking passages of

them '.

WHEN we recollec how slowly the mind of

man opens to abftrat ideas, and how difficult
(according to an observation in the Mahabarat)
an invisible path is to corporeal beings, it is
evident that the Hindoos must have attained an
high degree of improvement before their senti-
ments rose so far superior to the popular super-
{tition of their country. The different itates of
Greece had subsisted long, and had made con-
fiderable progress in refinement, before the
errors of false religion began to be deteted.
It was not until the age of Socrates, and in the
schools ot philosophy established by his disciples,
that principles adverse to the tenets of the
popular fuperfittion were much propagated.

A LONGER period of time elapsed before the
Romans, a nation of warriors and tlatefmen,
were enlightened by science, or ventured upon
any free disquisition concerning the objects or
the rites of worship authorized by their ancef-
tors. But in India the happy effects of progress
in fcicnce were much more early conspicuous.
Without adopting the wild computations of
Indian chronology, according to which, the
Mahabarat was composed above four thousand
years ago, we must allow, that it is a work of
very great antiquity, and the author of it disco-
vers an acquaintance with the principles of theo-
logy, of morals, and of metaph sics, morejuft
and rational, than seems to have been attained,
at that period, by any nation whose history is
known.

ECT o unable are the limited powers of the

human mind to orm an adequate idea of the
p, erci. Ins and operations of theSupreme Being,
tl- t in all the theories concerning them, of the
r. er:ilept hilofophers in the most enligh-
- .j n.ti'n , we find a lamentable mixture of
iiorcnce and error. From these the Brahmins
were not more exempt than the fages of other
countries. As they held that the system of na-
ture was nor only originally arranged by the
power and wxifdom of God, but that every event
which happened was brought about by his im-
mediate interposition, and as they could not
comprehend how a being could at in any place
unless where it was present, they supposed the
Deity to be a vivifying principle diffused
through the whole creation, an universal foul
that animated each part of it . Every intelli-
gent nature, particularly the fouls of men, they
ccnceived to be portions separated from this
p eat spirit', to which, after fulfilling their
dtieiny on earth, and attaining a proper degree
of purity, they would be again re-united. In
order to efface the slains with which a foul,
during its residence on earth, has been defiled,
by the indulgence of sensual and corrupt appe-
tites, they taught that it must pass, in a long
lucctlon of tranfmnigrations, through the bo-
dies of different animals, until, by what it
suffers and what it learns in the various forms
cf its exigience, it hall be so thoroughly refined
from aii pollution as to be rendered meet for
being absorbed into the divine essence, and re-
turns like a drop into that unbounded ocean
ircn which it originally illued . These doc-

trines of the Brahmins, concerning the Deity,
as the foul which pervades all nature, giving
activity and vigour to every part of it, as well
as the final re-union of all intelligent creatures
to their prinmaval source, coincide perfeEly
with the tenets of the Stoical School. It is re-
markable, that after having oblerved a near
resemblance in the most sublime sentiments of
their moral doctrine, we should likewise disco-
ver such a similarity in the errors of their the-
ological speculations .

THE human mind, however, when deflitute

of superior guidance, is apt to fall into a prac-
tical error with refped to religion, of a tendency
(till more dangerous. When philosophers, by
their attainments in science, began to acquire
such just ideas of the nature and perfections of
the Supreme Being, as convinced them that
the popular system of fuperfltition was not only
absurd but impious, they were fully aware of all
the danger which might arise from communi-
cating what they had discovered to the people,
incapable of comprehending the force of those
reasons which had swayed with them, and so
zealously attached to established opinions, as to
revolt againf any attempt to detect their false-
hood. Instead, therefore, of allowing any ray
of that knowledge which illuminated their own
minds to reach them, they formed a theory to
justify their own conduct, and to prevent the
darkness of that cloud which hung over the
minds of their fellow-men from being ever dif-
pelled. The vulgar and unlearned, they con-
tended, had no right to truth. Doomed yv
their condition to remain in ignorance, they

were to be kept in order by delusion, and
allured to do what is right, or deterred from
venturing upon what is wrong. by the hope of
those imaginary rewards which fuperltition pro-
mises, and the dread of those punishments
w'l-. h it threatens. In confirmation of this, I
m -t quote the dotrine of molt of the philo-
fophic fees. and to produce the words of almost
every emiient Greek and Roman writer. It
will be fuffcient, however, to lay before my
readers a remarkable passage in Strabo, to whom
1 have been so often indebted in the course of
my researches, and who was no less qualified
to judge with refpec to the political opinions
of his contemporaries, than to describe the
countries which they inhabit. " What is
" marvellous in fable, is employed," fays
he, " ometimes to pleare, and sometimes to

i' ir'pire terror, and both thele are of uie, not

' only with children, but with persons of ma-
" ture age. To children we propose delightful
" ficions, in order to encourage them to at
" well, and uch as are terrible, in order to
"' retrain them from evil. Thus when men
" are united in society, they are incited to
" hlat is laudable. by hearing the poets cele-
" bra:e the plendid actions of fabulous Itory,
· such as the labours of Hercules and 1 hefeus,

in reward for which they are now honoured

' as divinities, or by beho!ding their illultrious
' deeds exhibited to public view in painting
" and fcuipture. On the other hand, they are
"deterred trom vice, when the punishments
"inflicted by the gods upon evil-doers are re-

lated, and threats are denounced gaiainlt

' them ia awful words, or rcpreientei by
" fri.htful figures, and when men believe
; that thele threats have een rezilv executed
'; upon the guillt. For i: is ipoible to con

.i
c: xwomcn and the ;'. il.u titude, and t(

renlde

" render them holy, pious, and upright, by
"the precepts of reason and philosophy; fu-
" perftition, or the fear of the gods, must be
"called in aid, the influence of which is
" founded on ficions and prodigies. For the
" thunder of Jupiter, the agis of Minerva,
" the trident of Neptune, the torches and
"snakes of the furies, the spears of the gods,
" adorned with ivy, and the whole ancient
"theology, are all fables, which the legislators
" who formed the political constitution of
" hates employ as bugbears to overawe the
"credulous and simple Y."

THESE ideas of the philosophers of Europe

were precisely the fame which the Brahmins
had adopted in India, and according to which
they regulated their conduCt with refpet to the
great body of the people. As their order had
an exclusive right to read the sacred books, to
cultivate and to teach science, they could more
effectually prevent all who were not members of
it from acquiring any portion of information
beyond what they were pleased to impart.
When the free circulation of knowledge is not
circumscribed by luch retrictions, the whole
community derives benefit from every new
acquisition in science, the influence of which,
both upon sentiment and condut, extends in-
sensibly from the few to the many, from the
learned to the ignorant. But wherever the
dominion of false religion is completely efta-
blifhed, the body of the people gain nothing bv
the greatest improvements in knowledge. 'Iheir
philosophers conceal from them, with the utmolt
Solicitude, the truths which they have discover-
ed, and labour to support that fabric o ia-

pertition which it was their duty to have over.
turned. They not only enjoin others torefpec
the religious rites prcfcribed by the laws oftheir
country, but conformn to them in their own
practice, and, with every external appearance
of reverence and devotion, bow down before
the altars of deities, who muf inwardly be the
objects of their contempt. Instead of refemi-
ling the teachers of true religion in the benevo-
lent ardour with which they have always coln-
municated to their fello(w-men the knowledge
of those important ruths with which their own
minds were enlightened and rendered happy,
the ages of Greece, and the Brahmins of In-
dia, carried on, with studied artifice, afcheme
of deceit, and, according to an emphatic ex-
pression of an inspired writer, they detained the
truth in unrighteousness . They knew and ap-
proved what was true, but amongst the reft of
mankind they laboured to support and to perpe-
tuate what is false.

THUS I have gone through all the particulars

which I originally propoled to examine, and
have endeavoured to discover the ifate of the
inhabitants of India with respect to each of
them. If I had aimed at nothing else than to
describe the civil policy, the arts, the sciences,
and religious institutions of one of the molt an-
cient and molt numerous races of men, that
alone would have led me into inquiries and dif-
cuffions both curious and initruclive. I own,
however, that I have all along kept in view an
object more in:ereiing, as vell as of greater
importance, and entertain hopes, that if the
account which have given of the earli and high
civilization of India, and of the wondlrfal pro-

ess of its inhabitants in elegant arts and useful
cience, shall be received as ju't an I well-ela-
blifhed, it may have some influence upon the
behaviour of Europeans towards that people.
Unfortunately for the human species, in what-
ever quarter of the globe the people of Europe
have acquired dominion, they have found the
inhabitants not only in a Itate of society and im-
provement far inferior to their own, but differ-
ent in their complexion, and in all their habits
of life. Men in every itage of their career are
so satisfied with the progress made by the com-
munity of which they are members, that it be-
comes to them a tandard of perfection, and
they are apt to regard people, whole condition
is not similar, with contempt, and even aversion.
In Africa and America, the diflimilitude is so
conspicuous, that, in the pride of their fupe-
riority, Europeans thought themselves entitled
to reduce the natives of the former to slavery,
and to exterminate thole of the latter. Even in
India, though far advanced beyond the two
other quarters of the globe in improvement, the
colour of the inhabitants, their effeminate ap-
pearance, their unwarlike Ipirit, the wild ex.
trav'agance of their religious tenets and ceremo-
nies, and many other circumltances. confirn;ed
Europeans in such an opinion of their own pre
eminence, that thev have always vi, wed and
treated them as an inferior race ot men. Happy
would it be if any of the four European na-
tions, who have. fuccefiiv!y, acquired extensive
territories and power in India, could altogether
vindicate itself from having acted in this man-
ner Nothing, however, can have a m, re diret
and powerful tendency to inlpire Europeans,
proud of their own attainments in policy, Ici-
ence and arts, with proper lentiments cc(ncei ning
the people of India, and to teach them a due

regard for their natural rights as men, than
their being accustomed, not only to confider the
Hindoos of the present time as a knowing and
ingenious race of men, but to view them as de.
scended from ancettors who had attained to a
very high degree of improvement, many ages
before the lait itep towards civilization hiad
been taken in any part of Europe. It was by
an impartial and candid inquiry into their man-
ners, that the Emperor Akber was led to con-
fider the Hindoos as no less entitlcd to protecticn
-nd favour than his other fubjec's, and to go-
vern them with fuclh equity and mildness, as to
mrerit from a grateful people the honourable
.ppellation of " 'Ihe Guardian of Mankind."
It was from a thorough knowledge of their cha.
racter and acquirements, that his Vizier, Abul
Fazei, with a liberality of mind unexampled
amo.ong Mahomedans, prcnounces an high enco-
mium on the virtues of the Hindoos, both as
individuals and as menbers of society, and ce-
lebrates their att;nments in arts and sciences
of every kind . If I might presume to hope

ACCORDING to all the writers of an-

tiquity, the Indians are said to be divided

into seven tribes or casts. Strabo, lib. xv. p.
1029. C, &c. Diod. Sicul. lib. ii. p. 153, &c.
Arrian. Indic. c. o. They were led into this
error, it is probable, by confidering some of
the subdivisions of the calls, as if they had
been a distinct independent order. But that
there were no more than four original casts, we
learn from the concurrent testimony of the best
informed modern travellers. A most diftina
account of these we have in " La Porte Ouverte,
"ou la vraye Representation de la Vie, des
"Mceurs, de la Religion, et du Service des

cate. By gaining the confidence of an intelli.
gent Brahmin, he acquired information c-,n-
cerning the manner; and religion of the Indians,
more authentic and extensive than was known
to Europeans prior to the late tranllations from
the Sanreet language. I mention this book,
because it seens to be less known than it de.
serves to be. There remains now no doubt with
respect either to the number or the functions of
the calls, as both are ascertained from the mot
ancient and sacred books of the Hindoos, and
confirmed by the accounts of their own inftitu.

larnin-. According to them, tie different
catls proceeded from Brahma, the immediate

otTsfpting of an unlawful union between per-
sons of different calts. Thele are mo!ily deal-
eis in petty articles of retail trade. Preface to
the Code of Gentoo Laws, p. xlvi. and xcix.
This adventitious cast is not mentioned, as far
as 1 know, by anv European author. The dif-
tinction was too nice to he observed by them, and
they seem to confider the members of this cast,
as belonging to the Son,:ir-. Besides these ac-
knowledged calts, there is a race of unhappy
men, dioininated, on the Coromandel coast,
Pl,iars, and, in other parts of' India, Chanda-
las. 'Ihefe are out-casts from their original or-
der, who, by their misconduct, have forfeited
all the privileges of it. Their condition is, un-
doubtedly, the lowes degra!ation of human
nature. No person of any calt wiil h::.e the
leall communication with themn. Sonnerat,

i. e. a warrior of high cait, on the Malabar
coast, he may put him to death with impunity.
Water or milk are confidered as dv.iled even by
their hadow patling over them, and can::ot be
uscd until they are putrified. Avcen A!kbery,
vol. iii. p. 243. It is almn!ft i:nolfi;ilc for words
to express the sensation of vileefs that the nanme
of Pariar or Chandala conveys to the mind of
a Hindoo. Every Ilindoo who violates the
rules or inflitutions of his ca'l, finks into this
der:nded situation. This it is which renders
Hinidoos so resolute in adhering to the in!titu.
ti rs of their tribe, because the loss of cast is,
to them, the loss of all human comfort and
refpecability; and is a punifliment, beyond
comparison, more severe than excominunica-
tion, in the most triumphant peried of Paptl
power.

THt four original casts are named, and their

funtions defcrined in the Mahabarat, the mofl
ancient book of the Hindoos, and of higher

the diftintion of cafl has been omitted in the

drawn, as to render the ascent from an inferior

of gentlemen who have seen much of India,
and who observed a!i they saw with a discerning

of the Europeans have had some effet upon the
imanners and cuitonms of the natives. They

ence of European manners begins to be appa-
rent among the Hindoos who reside in the
town of Calcutta. Some of them drive about
in Engliff chariots, fit upon chairs, and furnish
their houses swith mirrors. Many circumstances
might be mentioned, were this the proper place,
which, it is probable, will contribute to the
progress of this spirit of imitation.

IT is amusing to observe how exatly the

ideas of an intelligent Asiatic co-incide wilh
those of Europeans on this subjet. " In re-
" fleEing," ays he, " upon the poverty of
" uran.lthe countries beyond the Oxus] and
"Arabia, I was at first at a loss to assign a rea-
" son why these countries have never been able
"to retain wealth, whilst, on the contrary,
"it is daily increafirg in Indoftan. Timour
"carried into Furan the riches of Turkev,
" Perlia, and Idoltan, but they are all difi-
"pated; and, during the reigns of the four
"firll Caliphs, Turkey, Persia, part of Ala-
"bia, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Spain, were their
" tributaries; but till they were not rich. It
" is evident, then, that this dissipation of the
" riches of a tate, mufft have happened either

' si-on

329

" from extraordinary drains, or from some

defet in government. Indoftan has been
"frequently plundered by foreign invaders,

and not one of its kings ever gained for it
"any acquisition of wealth; neither has the

country many mines of gold and silver, and

"vet lndo.tan abounds in money and every
'other kind of wealth. The abundance of

specie is undoubtedly owing to the large

" i;mortation of gold and silver in the ships of
" urope, and other nations, many of whom

"prosperous slate of Indoftan, it must be
" owing to the peculiar blessing of God."

mode, however, in which the Ryots of Indoltan

cient political conltitution, with relpect to which
gentlemen of superior difccrnment, who have
resided long in the country, and filled some of
the highelt atiois in government, have formed
very different opinions. Some have inagined
that grants of land were made by the fovercign
to villages or small communities, the inhabi-
tants of which, under the direction of their
own chiefs or heads-men, laboured it in corn-
lnon, and divided the produce of it among
them in certain proportions. Deicript. de i'lnde,

maintain, that the property of land has been
transferred from the crown to hereditary officers
of great eminence and power, denominated
Zcmindrs, who collec the rents from the
Ryots, and parcel out the lands among them.
Others contend, that the office of the eniin-
dars is temporary and ministerial, that they are
lmerely collectors of revenue, removeable a:
pleafire, and the tenure by which the Rots
hold their possessions is derived immediately
from the sovereign. 'Ihis last opinion i lur,

Though the opinion of the Committee of Re-
venue, ccnpofed of persons eminent for their
abiiities, leans to a conclusion against the here-
ditarv right of the Zemindars in the foil, yet
the Supreme Council, in the year 1786, de-
clined, for good reaobns, to give any decisive
judmrent on a subjed of such magnitude.
This note was sent to the press before had it
in my power to peruse Mr. Rouse's ingenious
and instructive Dissertation concerning the land-
ed property of Bengal. In it he adopts an
opinion contrary to that of Mr. Grant, and
maintains, with that candour and liberality of
sentiment which are always conspicuous where
there is no other objeEt in view but the disco-
very of truth, that the Zemindars of Bengal
possess their landed property by hereditary right.
Did I polfefs such knowledge, either of the state
of India, or of the system of adminiltration
eliablifhed there, as would be requisite for com-
paring these different theories, and determining
v. hch o: them merits the preference, the fubje&
of my researches does not render it necessary to
enter into such a disquisition. 1 imagine, how-
ever, that the state of landed property in India
might be greatly illuitrated by an accurate com-
parifcn of it with the rature of feudal tenures;
=nd i apprehend that there might be traced
there a ucceliion of changes taking place, in
!iuch the fame order as has been observed in
i urope, from hich it might appear, that the
pr'Lti:io of iaini was granted at first during
p ie.aure. afrerv ards for life, and at length be-
r .;;e erpttual and hereditary property. But
e\Cs utnder this last form, when land is acquired
eih'-e bv prcl;ae or inheritance, the manner
in v-,;:in tne right of property is confirmed and
rcniercd comptte in Europe by a Charter, in

India

India by a Sunnud from the sovereign, seems to
point out what was its original Rlate. Accord.
ing to each of the theories which I have men-
tioned, the tenure and condition of the Ryots
nearly resemble the description which I have
given of them. Their fRate, according to the
accounts of intelligent observers, is as happy
and independent as falls to the lot of any race
of men employed in the cultivation of the earth.
The ancient Greek and Roman writers, whose
acquaintance with the interior parts of India
was very imperfect, represent the fourth part of
the annual produce of land as the general ave-
rage of rent paid to the sovereign. Upon the
authority of a popular author who flourished in
India prior to the Christian ara, we may con-
clude that a sixth part of the people's income
was, in his time, the usual portion of the so-
vereign. Sacontala, At V. p. 53. It is now
known that what the sovereign receives from
land varies greatly in different parts of the
country, and is regulated by the fertility or
barrenness of the foil, the nature of the climate,
the abundance or scarcity of water, and many
other obvious circumflances. By the account
given of it, I hould imagine that, in some dif-
tricts, it Las been raised beyond its due propor.
tion. One circumstance with refpet to the ad-
ministration of revenue in Bengal merits no-
tice,' as it redounds to the honour of the Em-
percr Akber, the wisdom of whose govern ment
I have often had ccca.on to celebrate. A ge-
neral and regular afo;-rment of revenue in Ben-
gal was formed in his reign. All the lands
were then valued, and the rent of each inha-
bitant and of each village a!'crtained. A re-
gular gradation of accounts was eflablilhed.
The rents of the different inhabitants who lived
in one neighbourhood being colleced together,

formed

333

formed the account of a village; the rents of
several villages being next cotlede into one
view, formed the account of a larger portion
of iand. The aggregate of these accounts ex-
hibited the rent of a diftri&, and the fum to.
tal of the rents of all the diftrids in Bengal
fo-med the account of the revenue of the
v.ho:c province. From the reign of Akber to
the governmient of Jaffeer Ali Cawn, A. D.
17 7, the annual amount of revenue, and the
modes of levying it, continued with little va-
riation. But in order to raise the fum which
h- hid ftipula:d to pay on his elevation, he
.= irrted from the wife arrangements of Ak-
t-r ; many new modes of affeflfent were in-
tracuced, and exacions multiplied.

nued row of fladv trees, forming an avenue,

NOTE \V p. 268.

\XV cannot place the equitable and mild go-

vernn ent of Akber in a point of view more
advantageous, than by contrasting it with the
conduct of other Mahomedan princes. In no

country
334

country did this contrast ever appear more ftrik-
ing than in India. In the thousandth year of
the Christian wara, Mahmud of Ghazna, to
whose dominion were subjeCted the fame coun-
tries which formed the ancient kingdom of
Batria, invaded that country. Fvery ftep of
his progress in it was marked with blood and
desolation. The most celebrated pagodas, the
ancient monuments of Hindoo devotion and
magnificence, were deltroyed, the ministers of
religion were massacred, and with undiftin-
guiihing ferocity the country was laid waste, and
the cities plundered and burnt. About four
hundred years after Mahmud, Timur or Ta-
merlane, a conqueror of higher fame, turned
his irresistible arms againit Indoflan and,
though born in an age more improved, ,he not
only equalled, but often so far furpafled the
cruel deeds of Mahmud, as to be julfly branded
with the odious name of the " Destroying
Prince," which was given to him by the Hin-
doos, the undeferving victims of his rage. A
rapid but elegant description of their devafta-
tions may be found in Mr. Orme's Dissertation
on the establishments made by the Mahomedan
conquerors in Indoftan. A more full account
of them is given by Mr. Gibbon, vol. v. p.
646. vol. vi. p. 339, &c. The arrogant con-
tempt with which bigotted Mahomedans view
all the nations who have not embraced the reli-
gion of the prophet, will account for the unre-
lenting rigour of M!ahmud and Timur towards
the Hindoos, and greatly enhances the mcrit of
the tolerant pirit and moderation with which
Akber governed his fu jecst. \What inpreflion
the mild adminiriration of Akber made upon
the Hindoos, we learn from a beautiful ietter of
Jeffwant Sing, Rajah of Joudpore, to Aureng-
zebe, his fanatical and persecuting fuccenor.

I HAVE not attempted a description of any

subterraneous excavations but those of Elephan-
ta, because none of them have been so often
visited, or so carefully infpeted. In several
parts of India, there are, however, tfupendous
works of a similar nature. The extent and
magnificence of the excavations in the island of
Salfette are such, that the artist employed by
Governor Boon to make drawings of them,
asserted that it would require the labour of forty
thousand men for forty years to finish them.
Archaologia, vol. vii. p. 336. Loose as this
mode of estimation may be, it conveys an idea
of the impreflion which the view of them made
upon his mind. The Pagodas of Ellore, eigh-
teen miles fromAurungabad, are likewise hewn
out of the solid rock, and if they do not equal
those of Elephanta and Salfette in magnitude,
they surpass them far in their extent and num-
ber. M. Thevenot, who first gave any defcrip-
tion of these singular mansions, asserts, that for
above two 'lagues all around the mountain no-
thing is to be seen but Pagodas. Voy. part iii.
ch. 44. They were examined at greater leisure
and with more attention by M. Anquetil du
Perron, but as his long description of them is
not accompanied with any plan or drawing,
cannot convey a diftiii& idea of the whole. It
is evident, however, that they are the works of
a powerful people, and amiong the innumerable
figures in sculpture with which the walls are co-
vered, all the present objects of Hindoo wor-
ship may be diltinguifliel. Zend avefla. Disc.

INDIA, fays Strabo, produces a variety ct

fubltances which de the most admirable co-
lours. 'I hat the Iedirtiz, which produced the
beautiful blue colour, is the !.ime with the I-
digg of the moderns, we mav conclude not only
from the resemblance of the name, and the
similarity of the effects, but from the defcrip.
tion given by Pliny in the passage which I havc
quoted in the text. He knew that it was a
preparation of a vegetable substance, though he

was
338

was ill-informed both concerning the plant it-
self, and the process by which it was fitted for
use, which will not appear surprising when we
recollect the strange ignorance of the ancients
with refpet to the origin and preparation of
silk. From the colour of Indigo, in the form
in which it was imported, it is denominated by

ble substance, of such extensive utility in paint-
ing, dying, japanning, varnishing, and in the
manufacture of fealing-wax, is the production
of a very minute infeet. These insets fix
themselves upon the succulent extremities of
the branches of certain trees, and are soon
glued to the place on which they lfttle, by a
thick pellucid liquid which exudes from their
bodies, the gradual accumulation of which
forms a complete cell for each infect, which is
the tomb of the parent, and the birth-place of
its offspring. This glutinous fubitance, with
which the branches of trees are entirely cover-
ed, is the Gum-lacca. An account es its for.

it is evident that the ancient Indians must have
made some considerable proficiency in chemical

an account of this art as far as it was known
anciently. It is precisely the fame with that
now pratifed in callico-printing.

NOTE IX. p. 281.

As Sanikreet literature is altogether a new

acquisition to Europe, Baghvat-Geeta, the first
tranilation from that language, having been
published so late as A. D. 1785, it is intimately
connected with the subjet of my inquiries, and
may afford entertainment to some of my rea-
ders, after having reviewed in the text, with a
greater degree of critical attention, the two
Sanfireet works most worthy of notice, to give
here a succinct account of other compositions
in that tongue with which we haave been made
acquainted. The extensive use of the Sanfireet
language is a circumstance which merits parti-
cular attention. " The grand source of Indian
"literature," (faysMr. Halihed, the first !.nglifh-
man who acquired the knowledge of San-
fkreet,) " the parent of almost every dialet
" from the Persian gulf to the China seas, is
" the Sanitrect, a language of the molt venerable
"and unfathomable antiquity; which, al-
" though, at prelsr.t, hut up in the libraries

" of

" of Brahmins, and appropriated solely to the
"records of their religion, appears to have been
" current over most of.the Oriental world; and
" traces of its original extent may itill be dif-
" covered in almost every diftrid of Asia. I
" have been often astonished to find the fimili-
" tude of Sanfkreet words with those of Persian
"and Arabic, and even of Latin and Greek;
" and those not in technical and metaphorical
" terms, which the mutuation of refined arts
"and improved manners might have occasion-
"ally introduced, but in the ground-work of
"language, in monosyllables, in the names of
"numbtrs. and the appellations of such things
" as would be first discriminated on the imme-
" diate da;-. of civilization. The resemblance
: which ,iay ie

I bferved in the characers on

" the medals anii fiqnets of various diftridts of
"Asia, the light which they reciprocally re-
" flee upon each other, and the general ana-
" logy which they all bear to the fame grand
" prototype, afford another ample field for
"curiosity. The coins of Assam, Napaul,
" Calhmeere, and many other kingdoms, are
" all flamped with Sanfkreet characers, and
" mofly contain allusions to the old Sanfkreet
"mythology. The fame conformity I have
" observed on the ipreffion of feals from-
" Bootan and Thibet. A collateral inference
"may likewise be deduced from the peculiar
"arrangement of the Sanfkreet alphabet, so
"ve-v different from that of any other quarter
"of the world. This extraordinary mode of
"combination fill exilts in the gr-eaeft part
" of the East, from the Indus to l'gu, in dia-
"lecs now apparently unconnectd, and in
"characers copletely dillimilar; and it is a
"forcible argument that they are all derived

" from

341

" from the fame source. Another channel of
" speculation presents itself in the names of
"persons and places, of titles and dignities,
" which are open to general notice, and in
"which, to the farthest limits of Asia, may be
" found manifest traces of the Sanfkreet."
Preface to the Grammar of the Bengal Lan.
guage, p. 3. After this curious account of
the Sanfkreet tongue, I proceed to enumerate
the works which have been translated from it,
betides the two mentioned in the text.-I. To
Mr. Wilkins we are indebted for Hecto-pades or
Amii;:able InJiruc7icn, in a series of connected
fables, inrCrfperfed with moral, prudential, and
political maxims. This work is in such high
eteem throughcut the East, that it has been
translated into every language spoken there. It
did not ecape the notice of the Emperor
Akber, attentive to every thing that could con-
tribute to promote useful knowledge. He
directed his Vizier, Abul Fazel, to put it into
a !'vle suited to all capacities, and to illustrate
the obscure passages in it. which he accordingly
did, and gave it the title of, The Criterion of
Ifijcmn. At length, these fables made their
way into Europe, and have been circulated
there with additions and alterations, under the
names of Pilpay and Efop. Many of the San-
frreet apologues are ingenious and beautiful,
and have been copied or imitated by the fabulists
of other nations. But in some of them the
characters of the animals introduced are very
ill sustained; to describe a tyger as extremely
devout, and pracifing charity, and other reli-
gious duties, p. 16. or an old mouse well read
in the Ncet:e Sjtras, i. e. Systems of morality
and policy, p. 24.; a cat who read religious
books, p. 35, &c. discovers a want of taste,
and an inattention to propriety. Many of the

moral

moral sayings, if confidered as detached max-
ims, are founded upon a thorough knowledge
of life and manners, and convey inftrudrion
with elegant simplicity. But the attempt of the
author to form his work into a connected fe-
ries of fables, and his mode of interweaving
with them such a number of moral reflections
in prose and in verse, renders the flru&ure of
the whole so artificial that the perusal of it be-
comes often unpleasant. Akber was so sensible
of this, that, among other intlructions, he ad-
vises his Vizier to abridge the long digressions
in that work. By these tritures it is far from
my intention to detrat in the inalleft degree
from the merit of Mr. Wilkins. His country is
much indebted to him for having opened a new
source of science and taite. The celebrity of the
Ileeto-pades, as well as its intrinsic merit, not-
withstanding the defects which I have mention-
ed, justify his choice of it, as a work worthy
of being made known to Europe in its original
form. From reading this and his other tranfla-
tions, no man will rfufe him the praile, to
which he modestly confines his pretensions, " of
"having drawn a pidture which we suppose to
" be a true likeness, although we are unac-
" quainted with the original." Pref. p. xiv.-
2. In the first number of the New Aiaric
lifcellany, we have a tranflition of a celebrated
composition in the East, known by the title of
the Five Gems. It conlilts of flanzas by five
poets who attended the court of Abilfura, King
of Bengal. Some of thcle stanzas are limple
and elegant.-3. An ode tranilatcd from WVulli;
in which that extrava:ance or fancy, and thole
far-fetched and unnatural conceits, which !o of-
ten disgust Europeans with te poetical compo-
fitions of the alt, abound too much. The
editor has not informed us to whose knowledge

of

343

of the Sanikreet we are indebted for these two
translations.-4. Some original grants of land,
of very ancient dates, translated by Mr. Wil.
kins. It may seem odd, that a charter of legal
conveyance of property hould be ranked a-
mong the literary compositions of any people.
But so widely d- the manners of the Hindoos
differ from those of Europe, that as our law.
yers multiply words and clauses, in order to
render a grant complete, and to guard againit
every thing that may invalidate it, the Pundits
seem to dispatch the legal part of the deed with
brevity. bu, in a long preamble and conclu-
sion, make an extraordinary display of their
own learning, eloquence, and powers of com-
pefition, both in prose and in verse. The pre.
amie to one of these deeds is an encomium
of the monarch w ho grants the land, in a bold
frain of Eastern exaggeration: " When his
" innumerable army marched, the heavens

were io filled with the duit of their feet, that

' the birds of the air could reft upon it." " His
" elephants moved like walking mountains,
" and the earth, oppressed by their weight,
" mouldered into dust." It concludes with de.
nouncing vengeance againit thole who should
venture to infringe this grant: " Riches and
" the life of man are as transient as drops of
" water upon a leaf of the lotus. Learning
" this truth. 0 man, do not attempt to deprive

another of his property." Asiatic Research-

es. vol. i. p. z 2;, &c. The other grant, which
appears to be still more ancient, is not less re-
markable. Both were found engraved onplates
of copper. lb. p. 3;7, &c.-5. The tranfla-
tion of part of the Shafter, published by Co-
lonel Dowe, in the year 1768, ought perhaps
to have been first mentioned. But as this tran-
ilation was not made bv him from the Sanfkreet,

but

but taken from the mouth of a Brahmnin, who
explained the Shatter in Persian, or in the vul-
gar language of Bengal, it will fall more pro-
perly under notice hen we come to inquire
into the slate of science among the Hindoos,
than in this place, where e are endeavour-
ing to give some idea of their tatc in com-
potition.

NOTE X. p. 290.

As many of my readers may be unacquainted

with the extravagant length of the four eras
or periods of Indian chronology, it may be
proper to give an account of them from Mr.
Halhed's Preface to the Code of Gentoo Laws,
p. xxxvi.

I. THE Suttee 7Jgue (or age of purity) is

said to have lasted three millions two hundred
thousand years, and they hold that the life of
man was extended in that age to one hundred
thousand years, and that his stature was twenty-
one cubits.

2. THR Tirtah 7ogue (in which one third

of mankind was corrupted) they suppose to have
consisted of two million four hundred thou'and
years, and that men lived to the age often tnou-
sand years.

3. THE Dwuapaar Jogue (in which half of the

human race became depraved) endured one
million fix hundred thousand years, and the
life of man was then reduced to a thousand
years.

4. TH

345

4. THE CicSe 7ygue (in which all mankind

are corrupted, or raherleffened, for that is the
true meaning of Collec) is the present aera,
which they suppose ordained to subsist four hun-
dred thourand years, of which near five thousand
are already pall, and the life of man in that pe-
riod is limited to one hundred years.

IF we suppose the computation of time in the

Indian chronology to be made by solar or even
by lunar years, nothing can be more extrava-
gant in itself. or more repugnant to our mode
of calculating the duration of the world. found-
ed on sacred and infallible authority. Some at-
tempts have been made by learned men, par.
ticularly by MI. Bailly, in a very ingenious dif-
fertation on that subjet, to bring the chrono-
logy of the Hindoos to accord somewhat better
with that of the Old Testament; but, as I could
not explain the principles upon which he founds
his conclusions. without entering into long and
intricate difcuflions foreign from the fubje of
this DiTfertation, and as 1 cannot assent to some
of his opin'ons, I fball reft satisfied with refer-
ringto his Astron. Indienne, Disc. Prelim. p.
Ixxvii. and leave my readers to judge for them-
selves. I am happy to observe that a Memoir
on the Chronology of the Hindoos will be pub-
lifhed in the Second Volume of the Tranfaions
of the Society of Bengal, and I hope that some
learned member of that body will be able, from
his acquaintance ith the languages and history
of the country, to throw light upon a subjed
which its connection with religion and science
renders extremely interelting. From one cir-
cumftance. however, which merits attention,
we may conclude, that the information which
we have hitherto received concerning the chro-
nology of the Hindoos is very incorrect. We

have,
346

have, as far as I know, only five original ac-
counts of the different Jogues or aras of the
Hindoos. The first is given by M. Roger,
who received it from the Brahmins on the Co-
romandel coast. According to it, the Suttee
Jogue is a period of one million seven hundred
and twenty-eight thousand years; the Tirtah
Jogue is one million two hundred and ninety-
fix thousand ears; the Dwapaar Jogue is eight
hundred and fixty-feur thousand. The dura-
tion of the Collee Jogue he does not specify.
Porte Ouverte, p. 179. Ihe next is that of
M. Bernier, who received it from the Brahmins
of Benares. According to him, the duration
of the Suttee Jogue was two million five hun-
dred thousand years; that of the Tirtah Jogue
one million two hundred thousand years; that
of the Dwapaar Jogue is eight hundred and
fixty-four thousand years. Concerning the pe-
riod of the Collee Jogue, he, likewile, is silent.
Voyages, tom. ii. p. 160. The third is that of
Colonel I)ow, according to which the Suttee
Jogue is a period of fourteen millions of years;
the Tirtah Jogue one million eight thousand;
the Dwapaar Jogue feventy-two thousand; and
the Collee Jogue thirty-fix thousand years. Hilt.
of Hindoft. vol. i. p. 2. The fourth account
is that of M. Le Gentil, who received it from
the Brahmins of the Coromandel coast, and as
his information was acquired in the fame part
of India, and derived from the fame source
with that of M. Roger, it agrees with his in
every particular. Mem. de l'Academ. de» Sci-
ences pour 1772, tom. ii. part i. p. 176. 'Ihe
fifth is the account of Mr. l'alhed, which I
have already given. From this discrepancy,
not only of the total numbers, but of many of
the articles in the different accounts, it is ma-
nifeft that our information concerning Indian

chro-

347

343

chronology is hitherto as uncertain as the whole
system of it is wild and fabulous. To me it
appears highly probable, that when we under.
stand more thoroughly the principles upon
which the factitious a:ras or Jogues of the Hin.
does have been formed, that we may be more
able to reconcile their chronology to the true
mode of computing time, founded on the autho.
ri:v cf the Old Testament; and may likewise
find reason to conclude, that the account given
by their astronomers of the situation of the
heavenly bodies at the beginning of the Collee
Jogue, is not eftabliihed by atual observation,
but the result of a retrofpedive calculation.
Whoever undertakes to investigate farther the
chronology of the Hindoos, will derive great
assistance from a Memoir of Mr. Marfden on
that subject, in which he has explained the na-
ture of their year, and the several eras in use
among them, with much ingenuity and pre.
cifion. Philof. Tranfat. vol. lxxx. part ii.
p. 560.

NOTE XI. p. 297.

IN the public buildings of India, we find

proofs and monuments of the proficiency of the
Brahmins in science, particularly of their at-
tention to astronomical observation. Their re-
ligion enjoins, that the four fides of a Pagoda
should face the four cardinal points. In order
to execute this with accuracy, they take a me-
thod described by M. le Gentil, which disco-
vers a considerable degree of science. He care-
fully examined the position of one of their Pa-
godas, and found it to be perfecly exac. Voy.
tom. i. p. 133, &c. As some of their Pagodas
are very ancient, they must have early attained

such

such a portion of knowledge as was requisite
for placing them properly. On the ceilings of
Choultrys, and other ancient edifices, the twelve
signs of the zodiac are often delineated; and,
from their resemblance to those which are now
universally used, it is highly probable that the
knowledge of these arbitrary symbols was de-
rived from the East. Colonel Call has published
a drawing of the signs of the zodiac, which he
found on the ceiling of a Choultry at Verda-
pettah, in the Madura country. Phil. Tranfat.
vol. Ixii. p. 353. I have a drawing of them in
my possession, differing from his in foine of the
figures, but I cannot fay in what particular place
it was found. Sir Robert Barker describes an
observatory at Benares, which he visited A. D.
1772. In it he found instruments for arono-
mical observation, of very large dimensions,
and conftruaed with great skill and ingenuity.
Of all these he has published drawings. Phil.
Tranfat. vol. Ixvii. p. 598. According to
traditionary account, this observatory was built
by the Emperor Akber. The view which Sir
Robert took of it was an hasty one. It merits
a more attentive infpedion, in order to deter-
mine whether it was confiruted by Akber, or
ereaed in some more early period. Sir Robert
intimates, that none but Brahmins who under-
flood the Sanfkreet, and could consult the aftro-
nomical tables written in that language, were
capable of calcnlating e:!ipfes. P. Tieflenthaler
describes, in a very cursory manner, two obfer-
vatories furnished with inftrume::s f cxtraor-
dinary magnitude, at Jepour andi ()uein, in the
country of Malwa. Bernouiii, torn. i. p. 3,16.
