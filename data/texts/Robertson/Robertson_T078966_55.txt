-T WENTY-SIX year? had elapsed Bo° oK

since Columbus conduced the people vt..-

of Europe to the New World. During that of ^Ane,^a
period the Spaniards had made great progress know"n
in exploring its various regions. They had
vilited all the ifands scattered in different
clufl-rs through that part of the ocean which
flows in between North and South America.
They had failed along the eastern coast of the
continent from the river D)e la Plata to the
bottom of the Mexican gulf, and had found
that it ftretchled without interruption through
this vast portion of the globe. They had dif-
covered the great Southern Ocean, which
opened new lrofledss in that quarter. They
had acquired some knowledge of the coast of
Florida, which led them to obfcrvc the conti-

farther towards the north, other nations had
visited those parts which they negleEted. The
English, in a voyage, the motives and success
of which (hall be related in another part of this
History, had failed along the coast of America
from Labrador to the confines of Florida; and
the Portuguese, in quest of a snorter palfage
to the East Indies, had ventured into the
northern seas, and viewed the fame regions .
Thus, at the 1eriod where I have chosen to
take a view of the state of the New World, its
extent was known almost from its northern
extremity to thirty-five degrees south of the
equator. The countries which firetch from
thence to the southern boundary of America,
the great empire of Peru, and the interior Rate
of the extensive dominions uibjcEt to the fove-
rcigns of Mexico, were lill undiclovcrcd.

IEurope, or Asia, or Africa, the three noted -
divisions of the ancient continent, and not much
inferior in dimeniions to a third part of the
habitable globe.

AMERICA is remarkable not only for its mag-

nitude, but for its position. It firetches from
the northern polar circle to a high southern
latitude, above fifteen hundred miles beyond
the farthest extremity of the old continent on
that fide of the line. A country of such extent
pases through all the climates capable of be-
coming the habitation of man, and fit for
yielding the various productions peculiar either
to the temperate or to the torrid regions of the
earth.

The Andes may literally be said to hide their
heads in the clouds; the storms often roll, and
the thunder bursts below their summits, which,
though exposed to the rays of the fun in the
center of the torrid zone, are covered with ever-
lasting snows b.
rivers, FROM those lofty mountains descend rivers

proportionally large, with which the streams in
the ancient continent are not to be compared,
either for length of course, or the vast body of
water which they roll towards the ocean. The
Maragnon, the Orinoco, the Plata in South
America, the Miffifippi and St. Laurence in
North America, flow in such spacious channels,
that, long before they feel the influence of the
tide, they relemble arms of the lea rather than
rivers of frell water'.

and rivers. There is nothing in other parts of B °o K
the globe which resembles the prodigious chain '-
of lakes in North America. They may pro-
perly be termed inland seas of frefl water; and
even those of the second or third class in magni-
tude, are of larger circuit (the Caspian sea ex-
cepted) than the greatest lake of the ancient con-
tinent.

THE New World is of a form extremely tuformfa-

yourahle to

favourable to commercial intercourse. When commerce.
a continent, like Africa, is composed of one
vast solid mass, unbroken by arms of the sea
penetrating into its interior parts, with few
large rivers, and those at a considerable distance
from each other, the greater part of it teems
destined to remain for ever uncivilized, and to
be debarred from any active or enlarged com-
munication with the reft of mankind. When,
like Europe, a continent is opened by inlets of
the ocean of vast extent, such as the Mediterra-
nean and Baltic; or when, like Asia, its coast
is broken by deep bays advancing far into the
country, such as the Black Sea, the gulfs of
Arabia, of lP'rfia, of Bengal, of Siam, and of
Leotang; when the lilrrounding seas are filled
with large and fertile illands, and the continent
itlilf watered with a variety of navigable rivers,
tholfe regions may be ftiid to pIoftci whatevcr

BI , can

B ° °K can facilitate the progress of their inhabitants
(--- in commerce and improvement. In all these

respects America may bear a comparison with
the other quarters of the globe. The gulf of
Mexico, which flows in between North and
South America, may be confidered as a Medi-
terranean Tea, which opens a maritime com-
merce with all the fertile countries by which
it is encircled. The islands scattered in it are
inferior only to those in the Indian Archipe..
lago, in number, in magnitude, and in value.
As we ftrctch alorng the northern division of
the American liemifhcre, the Bay of Chefa-
peak preicnts a spacious inler, w ohi.;: conduc s
the navigator far into the interior parts of pro-
vinces no Iefs fertile than extensive; and if ever
the progress of cultuei and population shall
mitigate the extreme rigour of the climate in
the more northern difhitils of America, 1ud-
son's Bay m:y become as fubfcrvient to com-
mercial incerccurfe in th::t quarter of the globe,
as the Bairic is in Elurope. The other great
portion of the New \World is enconpafied on
every fide by the sea, except one narrow neck,
which fcparates the Atl.intic from the Pacific
Ocean; and though it be not olpened by fla-
cious bays er arms of the lea, its interior parts
are rendered accessible by a number of lar'e
rivc;s, i:d by so many auxiliary streams, flow-

i!'2

ing in such various diretions, that, without B K
any aid from the hand of industry and art, an -
inland navigation may be carried on through
all the provinces from the river De la Plata to
the gulf of Paria. Nor is this bounty of Na-
ture confined to the southern division of Ame-
rica; its northern continent abounds no less in
rivers which are navigable almofi to their
sources, and by its immense chain of lakes
provision is made for an inland communication,
more extenfivc and commodious than in any
quarter of the globe. The countries ifretching
from the gulf of Darien on one fide, to that of
California on the other, which form the chain
that binds the two parts of the American conti-
nent together, are not destitute of peculiar ad-
vantages. Their coast on one fide is walhed by
the Atlantic Ocean, on the other by the Pacific.
Some of their rivers sow into the former, some
into the latter, and secure to them all the com-
mercial benefits that may reliflt fiom a commu-
nication withl both.

BUT what most diftinuuiflles America fiom Tcmperituie

of its eli-

other parts of the earth, is the peculiar tempne- ,,..Ci.
rature of its climate, and the dillcrentt laws to
which it is liuiljce with relica to the diltribu-
rion of htat and cold. \;e canlnot determine

B oK part of the globe, merely by measuring its
'-v-^- distance from the equator. The climate of a

country is affected, in some degree, by its ele-
vation above the sea, by the extent of continent,
by the nature of the foil, the height of adjacent
mountains, and many other circumiRances. The
influence of these, however, is, from various
causes, less considerable in the greater part of
the ancient continent; and from knowing the
position of any country there, we can pronounce
with greater certainty, what will be the warmth
of its climate, and the nature of its produc-
tions.

other. In the New World, cold predominates.
The rigour of the frigid zone extends over half
of those regions, which ifould be temperate by
their position. Countries where the grape and
the fig should ripen, are buried under snow one
half of the year; and lands situated in the fame
parallel with the mofl fertile and best cultivated
provinces in Europe, are chilled with perpetual
frosts, which almof dcfltoy the power of vege-

uniform enjoyment of such genial warmth as is B o K
most friendly to life and to vegetation, the do- v- J
minion of cold continues to be felt, and winter,
though during a short period, often reigns with
extreme severity. If we proceed along the Ame-
rican continent into the torrid zone, we shall
find the cold prevalent in the New World ex-
tending itself also to this region of the globe,
and mitigating the excess of its fervour. While
the negro on the coast of Africa is scorched with
unremitting heat, the inhabitant of Peru breathes
an air equally mild and temperate, and is per-
petually shaded under a canopy of grey clouds,
which intercepts the fierce beams of the fun,
without obftruEling his friendly influencec. Along
the eastern coast of America, the climate, though
more similar to that of the torrid zone in other
parts of the earth, is neverthelcfs considerably
milder than in thoif countries of Asia and Africa
which lie in the lame latitude. If from the
southern tropic we continue our progress to the
extremity of the American continent, we meet
with frozen seas, and countries horrid, barren,
and scarcely habitable for cold, much sooner
than in the north r.

VARIOUS

BOOK VARIOUS causes combine in rendering the cli-

Iv.

^-""v~^ mate of America so extremely different from
C.eufes of
this. that of the ancient continent. Though the ut-

moll extent of America towards the north be
not yet discovered, we know that it advances
much nearer to the pole than either Europe or
Asia. Both these latter have large seas to the
north, which are open during part of the year;
and even when covered with ice, the wind that
blows over them is less intenfcly cold than that
which blows over land in the Iame high lati-
tudes. But in America the land stretches from
the river St. Laurence towards the pole, and
spreads out immensely to the weft. A chai:l
of enormous mountains, covered with snow and
ice, runs through all this dreary region. The
wind, in parting over such an extent of high
and fiozen land, becomes so impregnated with
cold, that it acquires a piercing keenness, swhich
it retains in its progress through warmer cli-
mates, and is not entirely mitigated until it
reach the Gulf of Mexico. Over all the con-
tinent of North America, a north-westerly
wind and exceflive cold are synonymous terms.
Even in the mofit Iultry weather, the moment
that the wind veers to that quarter, its pen,-
trating influence is felt in a transition from
heat lo cold, no less violent than fulddcn. 'To
this powerful catlic we may ascribe tl: cxtrt-

OTH-ER causes, no less remarkable, diminish

the active poser of heat in tho!e parts of the
American continent which lie between tlie
tropics. In all that portion of the globe, the
wind blows in an invariable direction from eafi
to weft. As this wind holds its course across
the ancient continent, it arrives at the countries

lwhich itretch along the weflern shore of Africa,
inflamed with all the fiery particles which it
iath collected from the iultry plains of Aria,
.nd the burning sands in the African deserts.
The coast of Africa is, accordingly, the region
of the earth which feels the most fervent heat,
and is expofcld to the unmitigated ardour of
the torrid zone. But this fame wind which
brings such an accession of warmth to the
countries lying between the river of Senegal
and Cafrarin, traverles the Atlantic Oce:n, be-
fore it reaches the American shore. It is cooled
in i!s pavigre over this vast body of water, and
is silt as a reicfhing gale along the coafl of

o K though among the warmest in America, ten-

perate, when compared with those which lie
opposite to them in Africa i. As this wind
advances in its course across America, it meets
with immense plains, covered with impene-
trable forefis, or occupied by large rivers,
marshes, and stagnating waters, where it can
recover no considerable degree of heat. At
length it arrives at the Andes, which run from
north to south through the whole continent.
in parsing over their elevated and frozen fum-
mits, it is so thoroughly cooled, that the
greater part of the countries beyond them
hardly feel the ardour to which they seem ex-
posed by their situation k. In the other pro-
vinces of America, from Tierra Ferme well-
ward to the Mexican empire, the heat of the
climate is tempered, in some places, by the
elevation of the land above the sea, in others,
by their extraordinary humidity, and in all, by
the enormous mountains scattered over this
trast. The islands of America in the Torrid
Zone are either fnmall or mountainous, and
are ,fanied alternately by refre(hing sea andl
land breezes,

THE causes of the extraordinary cold towards B o K

the southern limits of America, and in the seas - -
beyond it, cannot be ascertained in a manner
equally satisfying. It was long supposed that
a vast continent, distinguished by the name of
Terrra Aufralis Incognita, lay between the
southern extremity of America and the Ant-
arctic pole. The fame principles which ac-
count for the extraordinary degree of cold in
the northern regions of America, were em-
ployed in order to explain that which is felt at
Cape Horn and the adjacent countries. The
immense extent of the Iouthern continent, and
the large rivers which it poured into the ocean,
were mentioned and admitted by philoobphers
as causes sufficient to occasion the unusual fen-
fation of cold, and the still more uncommon
appearances of frozen seas in that region of the
glube. But the imaginary continent to which
Iuch influence was alcribed, having been
carched for in vain, and the space which it
was luppolcd to occupy having been found to
bc an open ft'a, new conj -churs must be formed
with rctpecst to the causes of a temperature of
climate, so extremniy diiferent ifom that which
we experience in countries removed at the fame
dirance from the opposite pole

situation, and the disposition of its parts, the
next objecI that merits attention is its condition
when first discovered, as far as that depended
upon the industry and operations of man. The
effects of human ingenuity and labour are more
extensive and considerable, than even our own
vanity is apt at first to imagine. When we
survey the face of the habitable globe, no
small part of thit fertility and beauty, which
we ascribe to tle hand of nature, is the work
of man. Hlis efforts, when continued through
a fucceflion of ages, change the appearance
and improve the qualities of the earth. As a
great part of the ancient continent has long
been occupied by nations far advanced in arts
and industry, our eye is accustomed to view
the earth in that form which it affuines when
rendered fit to be the refidcnce of a numerous
race of men, and to supply them with nourifni-

ment.

tcuheiv- 13BUT in the New World, the flare of mau;
<:" kind was ruder, and the alpect of Nature ex-

tremely differcrt. Throughout all its vail Ir
gions, there were only two monarchies remark-
able for extent of territory, or diftinguiflied by

any progress in improvement. The reft of Bov
this continent was poffelied by small inde-
pendent tribes, destitute of arts and industry,
and neither capable to correct the defects, nor
desirous to meliorate the condition of that part
of the earth allotted to them for their habita-
tion. Countries, occupied by such people,
were almost in the fame Qtate as if they had
been without inhabitants. Immense forests
covered a great part of the uncultivated earth;
and as the hand of indufiry had not taught the
rivers to run in a proper channel, or drained
off the stagnating water, many of the mos
fertile plains were overflowed with inundations,
or converted into marshes. In tie southern
provinces, where the warmth of the fun, t!:e
moisture of the climate, anc the fertility of the

every advantage of situation and climate. As
we advance towards the northern provinces of
America, Nature continues to wear the fame
uncultivated afpeci, and in proportion as the
rigour of the climate increases, appears more
desolate and horrid. There the forefls, though
not encumbered with the fame exuberance of
vegetation, are of immense extent; prodigious
marshes overspread the plains, and few marks
appear of human aRivity in any attempt to
cultivate or embellish the earth. No wonder
that the colonies sent from Europe were afto-
nihed at their firlt entrance into the New
World. It appeared to them waste, solitary,
and uninviting. When the English began to
fettle in America, they termed the countries of
which they took poflefflon, The JFilderiz.3.
Nothing but their eager expecation of finding
mines of gold, could have induced the Spa-
niards to penetrate through the woods andi
marlhes of America, where, at every ftep, they
observed the extreme difference between tle
uncultivated face of Nature, and that which
it acquires under the forming hand of indullry

it more wholesome, and friendly to life. When some.
any region lies neglected and deltitute of culti-
vation, the air stagnates in the woods, putrid
exhalations arise fron the waters; the surface
of the earth, loaded with rank vegetation, feels
not the purifying influence of the fun; the
malignity of the distempers natural to the cli.
mate increases, and new maladies no less noxious
are engendered. Accordingly, all the pro-
vinces of America, when first discovered, were
found to be remarkably unhealthy. This the
Spaniards experienced in every expedition into
the New World, whether deltined for conquest
or settlement. Though by the natural confti-
tution of their bodies, their habitual temper-
ance, and the persevering vigour of their
minds, they were as much formed as any
people in Europe for active service in a sultry
climate, they felt severely the fatal and perni-
cious qualities of those uncultivated regions
through which they marched, or where they
endeavoured to plant colonies. Great numbers
were cut off by the unknown and violent dil-
eaies with which they were infected. Such as
survived the dePiirulive nrage of those maladies,
were not exempted from the noxious influence
of the climate. They returned to Europe, ac-

Notwithstanding the vast extent of America,

kinds of quadrupeds known, the largest of
which did not exceed the size of a rabbit. On
the continent, the variety was greater; and
though the individuals of each kind could not
fail of multiplying exceedingly, when almoit

raaceriftical, as those which we have obfervecl
in its quadrupeds. Birds are more independent
of man, and less affieted by the changes which
his industry and labour make upon the slate
of the earth. They have a greater propensity
to migrate from one country to another, and
can gratify this instinct of their nature without
difficulty or danger. Hence the number of
birds common to both continents is much
greater than that of quadrupeds; and even such
as are peculiar to America nearly resemble
those with which mankind were acquainted in
similar regions of the ancient hemisphere.
The American birds of the torrid zone, like
those of the fame climate in Asia and Africa,
are decked in plumage, which dazzles the eye
with the beauty of its colours; but nature,
satisfied with clothing them in this gay drels,
has denied mos of them that melody of
found, and variety of notes, which catch and
delight the ear. The birds of the temperate
climates there, in the fame manner as in our
continent, are less splendid ili their appear-
ance, but, in compensation for that defect,
they have voices of greater compass, and more
melodious. In some dijfri&s of America, the
pnwholfonme temperature of the air seems to

be unfavourable even to this part of the crca- B °° K
tion. The number of birds is less than in 'I
other countries, and the traveller is struck with
the amazing solitude and silence of its forests a.
It is remarkable, however, that America, where
the quadrupeds are so dwarfiih and dastardly,
mhould produce the Condor, which is intitled to
pre-eminence over all the flying tribe, in bulk,
in strength, and in courage b.

moisture and cold, which predominate so re-
markably in all parts of America, must have
great influence upon the nature of its foil ;

regions which never feel the extreme rigour of

fruits, which are found in the corresponding
parts of the other continent. If we wilh to
rear in America the producions which abound
in any particular dittri(t of the ancient world,
we must advance several degrees nearer to the
line, than in the other hemisphere, as it requires
such an increafc of heat to counterbalance the
natural frigidity of the foil and climate c. At
the Cape of Good Hope, several of the plants,
and fruits peculiar to the countries within the

at St. Augustine, in Florida, and Charles-
Town, in South-Carolina, though considerably
nearer the line, they cannot be brought to
thrive with equal certainty ". But, if allowance
be made for this diversity in the degree of heat,
the foil of America is naturally as rich and ser-
tile as in any part of the earth. As the country
was thinly inhabited, and by a people of little
industry, who had none of the domestic animals,
which civilized nations rear in such vast num-
bers, the earth was not exhaufled by their
consumption. The vegetable productions, to

great part of their nourilhment from air and
water, if they were not destroyed by man and
other animals, they would render to the earth
more, perhaps, than they take from it, and
feed rather than impoverish it. Thus the unoc-
cupied foil of America may have gone on en-
riching for many ages. The vast number as
well as enormous size of the trees in America,
indicate the extraordinary vigour of the foil in
its native state. When the Europeans first be-
gan to cultivate the New World, they were afto-
nifhed at the luxuriant power of vegetation in
its virgin mould; and in several places the inge-

B o K America peopled? By what course did man:
L" kind migrate from the one continent to the

other ? and in what quarter is it most probable
that a communication was opened between
them ?

-o tradition WE know, with infallible certainty, that all
concerning
it aong the human race spring from the fame source,
themselves.

and that the descendants of one man, under
the proteEtion, as well as in obedience to the
command of Heaven, multiplied and reple.
nifhed the earth. But neither the annals nor
the traditions of nations reach back to those
remote ages, in which they took poffelfion
of the different countries, where they are now
fettled. We cannot trace the branches of this
sirss family, or point out with certainty the time
and manner in which they divided and spread
over the face of the globe. Even among the
most enlightened people, the period of authen-
tic history is extremely short, and every thing
prior to that is fabulous or obscure. It is not
surprising, then, that the unlettered inhabitants
of America, who have no solicitude about futu-
rity, and little curiosity concerning what is pail,
lihould be altogether unacquainted with their
own original. The Californians and Eflimaux,
in particular, who occupy those countries in Ame-
rica which approach nearest to the ancient con-

tinent,

tinent, are so remarkably rude, that it is altoge- B °V° K
ther vain to search among them for such in- -
formation as might discover the place from
whence they came, or the anceltors of whom
they are descended . Whatever light has been
thrown on this fubjeet, is derived, not from the
natives of America, but from the inquisitive
genius of their conquerors.

WHEN the people of Europe unexpectedly Various

discovered a New World, removed at a vait l.i
distance from every part of the ancient conti-
nent which was then known, and filled with
inhabitants whose appearance and manners dif-
sered remarkably from the reft of the human
species, the question concerning their original
became naturally an objeEt of curiosity and at-
tention. The theories and speculations of inge-
nious men with refpeEt to this fubjct&, would
fill many volumes; but are often so wild and
chimerical, that I flould offer an insult to the
pnderftanding of my readers, if I attempted ei-
ther minutely to enumerate or to refute them.
Some have presumptuously imagined, that the
people of America were not the offspring of the
fame common parent with the reft of mankind,
but that they formed a separate race of men,

»- r tution of their bodies, as well as in the cha-

racceriftic qualities of their minds. Others
contend, that they are descended from fomg
remnant of the antediluvian inhabitants of the
earth, who survived the deluge, which swept
away the greatest part of the human species in
the days of Noah; and preposterously suppose
rude, uncivilized tribes, scattered over an un-
cultivated continent, to be the most ancient
race of people on the earth. There is hardly
any nation from the north to the south pole, to
which some antiquary, in the extravagance of
conjecture, has not ascribed the honour of
peopling America. The Jews, the Canaanites,
the Phenicians, the Carthaginians, the Greeks,
the Scythians in ancient times, are supposed
to have fettled in this weflern world. The
Chinese, the Swedes, the Norwegians, the
VWelfh, the Spaniards, are said to have sent
colonies thither in later ages, at different
periods, and on various occasions. Zealous
advocates stand forth to support the respective
claims of those people; and though they reft
upon no better foundation than the casual re-
f.;lblance of tome cultomrs, or the supposed
affinity between a few words in their different
languages, much erudition and more *zeal have
been employed, to little purpose, in defence

of

of the opposite systems. Those regions of con- B o0 K
jeCture and controversy belong not to the hifto- --
rian. His is a more limited province, con-
fined to what is established by certain or highly
probable evidence. Beyond this I shall not
venture, in offering a few observations, which
may contribute to throw tome light upon this
curious and much agitated question.

originally united to the ancient continent, and
disjoined from it by the (hock of an earth-
quake, or the irruption of a deluge. Others
have imagined, that bome venfel being forced
fiom its course by the violence of a westerly
wind, might be driven by accident towards the
American coast, and have given a beginning
to population in that desolate continent '. But
with refpec to all those systems, it is vain
either to reabon or inquire, because it is im-
possible to come to any decision. Such events
as they fuppole are barely poTible, and may

nal of the Americans, merely by tracing the
resemblance between their manners and thole
of any particular people in the ancient conti-
nent. If we suppose two tribes, though placed
in the molt remote regions of the globe, to
be in the fame state of society, and to resemble
each other in the degree of their improvement,
they muff feel the fame wants, and exert the fame
endeavours to supply them. The fame objects will
allure, the fame paflions will animate them, and
the fame ideas and sentiments will arise in their
minds. The characer and occupations of the
hunter in America muff be little different from
those of an Asiatic, who depends for fubfifience
on the chace. A tribe of savages on the banks
of the Danube mutl nearly resemble one upon
the plains wafled by the Miffifippi. Inrfead
then of presuming from this similarity, that there
is any affinity between them, we should only
conclude, that the difpoftion and manners of
men are formed by their situation, and arise from
the state of society in which they live. The

9 moment

moment that begins to vary, the charater of B ooK
a people must change. In proportion as it ad- 'Y J
vances in improvement, their manners refine,
their powers and talents are called forth. In
every part of the earth the progress of man hath
been nearly the fame, and we can trace him in
his career from the rude simplicity of savage
life, until he attains the industry, the arts, and
the elegance of polilhed society. There is no-
thing wonderful then in the similitude between
the Americans and the barbarous nations of our
continent. Had Lafitau, Garcia, and many
other authors, attended to this, they would nor
have perplexed a subject which they pretend to
illufirate, by their fruitless endeavours to efta-
blifl an affinity between various races of people
in the old and new continents, upon no other
evidence than such a resemblance in their man-
ners as necessarily arises from the similarity of
their condition. There are, it is true, among
every people, some customs, which, as they do
not flow from any natural want or desire pe-
culiar to their situation, may be denominated
usages of arbitrary institution. If between two
nations fettled in remote parts of the earth,
a perseEt agreement with respect to any of
thele should be discovered, one might be led
to fulpect that they were connected by tome
affinity. If, for example, a nation were found

in

1Bo 0 K in America that consecrated the seventh day to
L- -'rJ religious worship and reft, we might justly sup-

pose that it had derived its knowledge of this
usage, which is of arbitrary institution, from the
Jews. But, if in another nation, the first ap-
pearance of every new moon was celebrated
with extraordinary festivity, this monthly ferti-
val could be confidered as nothing more than an
expression of joy natural to man on the return
of the planet which guides and cheers him in the
night. The inflances of cultorns, merely arbi-
trary; common to the inhabitants of both hemi-
spheres, are, indeed, so few and so equivocal,
that no theory concerning the population of the
New World ought to be founded upon them.

from observation of their religious rites and
practices, are no less fanciful, and destitute cf
solid foundation. When the religious opinions
of any people are neither the result of rational
inquiry, nor derived from the infLructiions of
revelation, they must needs be wild and extra-
vagant. Barbarous nations are incapable of
the former, and have not been blessed with the
advantages arising from the latter. Still, how-

appear mofl wild and capricious, holds a courei
so regular, that in every age and country tli;

with fimnilar effects. The savage of Europe or ---
America, when filled with superstitious dread of
invisible beings, or with inquisitive solicitude to
penetrate into the events of futurity, trembles
alike with fear, or glows with impatience. He
has recourse to rites and practices of the fame
kind, in order to avert the vengeance which he
jluppofes to be impending over him, or to divine
the secret which is the objecE of his curiolity.
Accordingly, the ritual of liperftition, in one
continent, eenms, in many particulars, to be a
transcript of that eftablifled in the other, and
both authorile similar institutions, sometimes so
frivolous as to excite pity, foretimes lb bloody
ant barbarous as to create horror. Bu: without
supposing any consanguinity between fiuch cdi-
tant nations, or imagiining that their religious
ceremonies were conveyed by tradition from the
ne to the other, we may ascribe this unifor-
mitl, which in many inflances tiems very amaz-
ing, to the natural operation of superstition and
inthufiafnm upon the weakness of the human
lind.

rica were firangers to many of those simple in.
ventions, which were almost coeval with society
in other parts of the world, and were known in
the earliefl periods of civil life with which v;e
have any acquaintance. From this it is manifeRt,
that the tribes which originally migrated to
America, came off from nations which muR
have been no less barbarous than their posterity,
at the time when they were firif discovered by
the Europeans. For, although the elegant and
refined arts may decline or perish, amidst the
violent flocks of those revolutions anu disasters
to which nations are exposed, the necessary arts
of life, when once they have been introduced
among any people, are never loft. None of the
vicifitudes in human affairs affect these, and they
continue to be pratifed as long as the race of
men exists. If ever the use of iron had been
known to the savages of America, or to their
progenitors, if ever they had employed a plough,
a loom, or a forge, the utility of those inven.
tions would have preserved them, and it is im-
pofible that they should have been abandoned or
forgotten. We may conclude then, that the

Americans sprung from some people, who were Bo oK

f the rude tribes fettled in that part of our he-
niphere can be supposed to have visited a coun-
ry so remote. They possessed neither enterprise,
or ingenuity, nor power, that could prompt
hem to undertake, or enable them to perform,
uch a distant voyage. That the more civilized
ations in Asia or Africa are not the progenitors
f the Americans is manifest, not only from the
bfcrvations which I have already made con-
erning their ignorance of the most simple and
eceffary arts, but fiom an additional circum-
ance. Whenever any people have experienced
c advantages which men enjoy, by their domi-
ion over the inferior animals, they can neither
bfift without the nourishment which these as-
rd, nor carry on any considerable operation in-
pendent of their ministry and labour. Accord-
gly, the first care of the Spaniards, when they
ttied in America, was to flock it with all the

found there the animals peculiar to those regions
of the globe where they were originally leated,
In all America, however, there is not one animal,
tame or wild, which properly belongs to th
warm, or even the more temperate countries

dary, the horle, the cow, were as much unknow
in America, as the elephant or the lion. From
which it is obvious, that the people who firstset

hunters in their excursions after game, or by
soldiers employed in levying the taxes, and the
court of Moscow effimated the importance of
those countries only by the small addition which
they made to its revenue. At length, Peter the
Great atcended the Ruffian throne. His enlight.
ened, comprehensive mind, intent upon every cir.
cumffance that could aggrandize his empire, or
render his reign illustrious, discerned conle.
quences of those discoveries, which had escaped
the observation of his ignorant predecessors. He
perceived, that in proportion as the regions of
Asia extended towards the ealt, they mufft ap
proach nearer to America; that the communi.
cation between the two continents, which had
long been searched for in vain, would probably
be found in this quarter, and that by opening it,
some part of the wealth and commerce of the
western world might be made to flow into hil
dominions by a new channel. Such an objest
suited a genius that delighted in grand schemes.
seter drew up inffrutions with his own hand
for prosecuting this design, and gave orders for
carrying it into execution'.

His successors adopted his ideas, and pursued B OOK
his plan. The officers whom the Ruffian court -'-J
employed in this service, had to firuggle with so
many difficulties, that their progress was ex-
tremely flow. Encouraged by tome faint tradi-
tions among the people of Siberia, concerning a
successful voyage in the year one thousand fix
hundred and forty-eight, round the north-eafl
promontory of Asia, they attempted to follow
the fame course. Vessels were fitted out, with
this view, at different times, from the rivers
Lena and Kolyma; but in a frozen ocean, which
nature seems not to have defined for navigation,
they were exposed to many difaflers, without be-
ing able to accomplilh their purpose. No vessel
fitted out by the Ruffian court ever doubled this
formidable Cape k; we are indebted for what is
known of those extreme regions of Asia, to the
discoveries made in excursions by land. In all
those provinces an opinion prevails, that there
are countries of great extent and fertility, which
lie at no considerable distance from their own
coasts. These the Ruffians imagined to be part
of America; and several circumstances concur-
red not only in confirming them in this belief,
but in persuading them that some portion of
that continent could not be very remote. Trees
of various kinds, unknown in those naked re-
gions of Asia, are driven upon the coast by an

AFTER weighing all these particulars, and

comparing the position of the countries in Alia
which had been discovered, with Iuch parts in
the north-west of America as were already
known, the Ruffian court formed a plan, which
would have hardly occurred to any nation lels
accustomed to engage in arduous undertakings,
and to contend with great difficulties. Orders
were issued to build two veflels at the small vil-
lage of Ochotz, fiuated on the sea of Kamchatka,
to fail on a voyage of discovery. Thoulgh that
dreary uncultivated region furnished nothing that
could be of use in constructing them, but Iome
larch trees; though not only the i!o!!, the cur-

under the command of the captains Behring and B oo K

the New World, in a quarter where it had never
been approached. They shaped their course to-
wards the east; and though a storm soon fepa-
rated the vessels, which never rejoined, and many
disasters besel them, the expectations from the
voyage were not altogether frustrated. Each of
the commanders discovered land, which to them
appeared to be part of the American continent;
and, according to their observations, it seems to
be situated within a few degrees of the north-
weft coast of California. Each set rome of his
people ashore; but in one place the inhabitants
fled as the Ruffians approached; in another, they
carried off those who landed, and destroyed their
boats. The violence of the weather, and the
distress of their crews, obliged both captains to
quit this inhospitable coast. In their return they
touched at several islands, which stretch in a
chain from eaf: to weft between the country
which they had diScovered and the coast of Asia.
They had some intercourse with the natives,
who leelmed to them to resemble the North Ame-
ricans. They prelented to the Rufflans the calu-

ing a period of more than forty years, seems to
have relinquihled every thought of prosecuting
discoveries in that quarter. But in the year one
thousand seven hundred and fixty-eight, it was
unexpectedly resumed. The Sovereign, who had
been lately feated on the throne of Peter the
Great, possessed the genius and talents of her
illustrious predecessor. During the operations of
the inoft arduous and extensive war in which the
Ruffian empire was ever engaged, she formed
schemes and executed undertakings, to which
more limited abilities would have been incapable
of attending but amidst the leisure of pacific
times. A new voyage of discovery from the
eastern extremity of Aria was planned, and cap.
tain Krenitzin and lieutenant Levafheff were
appointed to command the two vessels fitted out
for that purpose. In their voyage outward they
held nearly the fame course with the former navi-
gators, they touched at the fame islands, observed
their situation and productions more carefully,
and discovered several new islands, with which
Behring and Tfchirikow had not fallen in.
Though they did not proceed so far to the east
as to revisit the country which Behring and
Tfchirikow supposed to be part of the Ameri-

9 can

can continent, yet, by returning in a course con- B °Oo K
fiderably to the north of theirs, they corre&ed v"'
some capital mistakes into which their predecef-
fors had fallen, and have contributed to facilitate
the progress of future navigators in those seas'.

THus the possibility of a communication be-

tween the continents in this quarter refts no
longer upon mere conjecture, but is eftablilhed
by undoubted evidence ". Some tribe, or some
families of wandering Tartars, from the restless
spirit peculiar to their race, might migrate to
the nearest islands, and, rude as their knowledge
of navigation was, might, by pairng from one
to the other, reach at length the coast of
America, and give a beginning to population
in that continent. The distance between the
Marian or Ladrone islands and the nearest land
in Asia, is greater than that between the part of
America which the Ruffians discovered, and
the coast of Kamchatka; and yet the inhabit-
ants of those islands are manifestly of Asiatic
extract. If, notwithstanding their remote fitua-
tion, we admit that the Marian islands were
peopled from our continent, distance alone is
no reason why we flould hesitate about admit-
ting that the Americans may derive their ori-

Bo OK ginal from the fame source. It is probable that
I--.-. future navigators in those seas, by fleering

farther to the north, may find that the conti-
nent of America approaches still nearer to Asia.
According to the information of the barbarous
people, who inhabit the country about the
north-east promontory of Asia, there lies, off
the coast, a finall island, to which they fail in
less than a day. From that, they can descry a
large continent, which, according to their de-
scription, is covered with forests, and possessed
by people whose language they do not under-
fiand ". By them they are supplied with the
skins of martens, an animal unknown in the
northern parts of Siberia, and which is never
found but in countries abounding with trees.
If we could rely on this account, we might con-
clude, that the American continent is separated
from ours only by a narrow strait, and all the
difficulties with respect to the communication
between them would vanish. What could be
offered only as a conjecture when this History
was first publilhed is now known to be certain.
The near approach of the two continents to
each other has been discovered and traced in a
voyage undertaken upon principles so pure and
so liberal, and concluded with bt much profcf-
fional skill, as refleel lutre upon the reign of

As early as the ninth century, the Norwegians A.D. S0o,

after a long interruption, was renewed in the
last century. Some Lutheran and Moravian
missionaries, prompted by zeal for propagating
the Christian faith, have ventured to fettle in
this frozen and uncultivated region P. To
them we are indebted for much curious informa-
tion with respect to its nature and inhabitants.
We learn, that the north-west coast of Green-
land is separated from America by a very nar-
row strait; that, at the bottom of the bay into
which this strait conducts, it is highly probable
that they are united q; that the inhabitants of
the two countries have tome intercourse with

aspect, dress, and mode of living; that some

BY these decisive fa&s, not only the confan-

guinity of the Efquimaux and Greenlanders is
elcablifled, but the possibility of peopling
America from the north of Europe is demon-
ftrated. If the Norwegians, in a barbarous
age, when science had not begun to dawn in
the north of Europe, poffelred fulch naval Ikill
as to open a communication with Greenland,
their ancestors, as much addited to roving by
Tea, as the Tartars are to wandering by land,
might, at some more remote period, accom-
plifh the fame voyage, and fettle a colony there,
whose descendents might, in progress of time,
migrate into America. But if, instead of ven-
turing to fail directly from their own coast to
Greenland, we suppose that the Norwegians
held a more cautious course, and advanced from

that this navigation cannot be confidered as
either longer or more hazardous, than those
voyages which that hardy and enterprising race
of men is known to have performed in every age.

8. THOUGH it be possible that America may Probably

peopled fronl

have received its first inhabitants from our con- the north.
tinent, either by the north-west of Europe or
the north-east of Asia, there seems to be good
reason for supposing that the progenitors of all
the American nations, from Cape Horn to the
southern confines of Labrador, migrated from
the latter rather than the former. The Efqui-
raux are the only people in America, who, in
their aspect or chara6cer, bear any resemblance
to the northern Europeans. They are mani-
feftly a race of men, dif'inEt from all the
nations of the American continent, in lan-
guage, in disposition, and in habits of life.
Their original, then, may warrantably be traced
up to that source, which I have pointed out.
But, among all the other inhabitants of Ame-
rica, there is such a striking similitude in the
form of their bodies, and the qualities of their
minds, that, notwirhftanding the diversities oc,
cafioned by the influence of climate, or unequal
progrcis in improvement, we mult pronounce

them

B °0 K them to be descended from one source. There
'-vy-. may be a variety in the shades, but we can every

where trace the fame original colour. Each
tribe has something peculiar which distinguishei
it, but in all of them we discern certain features
common to the whole race. It is remarkablk,
that in every peculiarity, whether in their per.
sons or dispositions, which characerife the Amr.
ricans, they have orne reiemblance to the rude
tribes scattered over the north-east of Asia,
but almost none to the nations fettled in the
northern extremities of Europe. We may, there.
fore, refer them to the former origin, and con.
clude that their Asiatic progenitors, having
fettled in those parts of America, where the
Ruffians have discovered the proximity of the
two continents, spread gradually over its various
regions. This account of the progress of po-
pulation in America, coincides with the tradi.
tions of the Mexicans concerning their own
origin, which, imperfeat as they are, were
preserved with more accuracy, and merit greater
credit, than those of any people in the New
World. Accorcing to them, their anceflors
came from a remote country, situated to the
north-west of Mexico. The Mexicans point
out their various stations as they advanced from
this, into the interior provinces, and it is prc-
cifely the fame route which they murl have held,
if they had been emigrants fiom Asia. The

the history of America. I have ventured to
inquire, but without presuming to decide. Sa-

that it is impossible to arrive at conclusions
which are certain, there may be some merit in

civil society had made considerable advanc(s,

man appears under the rudest form in which we
can conceive him to subsist. We behold commu-
nities just beginning to unite, and may examine
the sentiments and actions of human beings in
the infancy of social life, while they feel but im-
perfeEtly the force of its ties, and have scarcely
relinquished their native liberty. That state of
primraval simplicity, which was known in our
continent only by the fanciful description of
poets, really exifced in the other. The greater
part of its inhabitants were Strangers to industry
and labour, ignorant of arts, imperfectly ac-
quainted with the nature of property, and enjoy-
ing almost without reftriclion or controul the
blessings which flowed spontaneously from the
bounty of nature. There were only two nations
in this vast continent which hadl emerged from
this rude state, and had made any considerable
progress in acquiring the ideas, and adopting the
inflitutions, which belong to polished societies.

or to invefligate every minute circumstance
which contributes to form the character of its
members. Such an inquiry would lead to details
of immeasurable and tiresome extent. The qua-

their true character under this rude form, and tiu'n
to collec the features by which they are diftin-
guifhed, requires an observer poffefied of no
less impartiality than discernment. For, in
every stage of society, the faculties, the senti-
ments and desires of men are so accommodated
to their own state, that they become standards
of excellence to themselves, they affix the idea
of perfeqion and happiness to those attainments
which resemble their own, and wherever the
objects and enjoyments to which they have been
accustomed are wanting, confidently pronounce
a people to be barbarous and miserable. Hence
the mutual contempt with which the members
of communities, unequal in their degrees of im-
provement, regard each other. Polished na-
tions, conscious of the advantages which they
derive from their knowledge and arts, are apt
to view rude nations with peculiar scorn, and,
in the pride of superiority, will hardly allow
either their occupations, their feelings, or their
pleasures, to be worthy of men. It has seldom

incapacity
obIhefirft and who had opportunity of beholding its va-

rious tribes, while entire and unfubdued, were
far from poffefling the qualities requisite for ob.
serving the striking fpeaacle presented to their
view. Neither the age in which they lived,
nor the nation to which they belonged, had
made such progress in true science, as inspires
enlarged and liberal sentiments. The con-
querors of the New World were mostly illiterate
adventurers, destitute of all the ideas which
should have direEted them in contemplating
obje&s, so extremely different from those with
which they were acquainted. Surrounded con-
tinually with danger, or struggling with hard-
ships, they had little leisure, and less capacity,
for any speculative inquiry. Eager to take pof-
fellion of a country of such extent and opulence,
and happy in finding it occupied by inhabitants
so incapable to defend it, they hastily pronounced
them to be a wretched order of men, formed
merely for servitude; and were more employed
in computing the profits of theirPlabour, than in
inquiring into the operations of their minds, or
the realons of their customs and institutions.
The persons who penetrated at subsequent periods

into

into the interior provinces, to which the know- B oo K
ledge and devastations of the first conquerors did ----
not reach, were generally of a similar character;
brave and enterprising in an high degree, but so
uninformed as to be litrle qualified either for ob-
serving or describing what they beheld.

NOT only the incapacity, but the prejudices and their

prejudices

of the Spaniards, render their accounts of the
people of America extremely defective. Soon
after they planted colonies in their new con-
quests, a difference in opinion arose with refpeft
to the treatment of the natives. One party,
solicitous to render their servitude perpetual, re-
presented them as a brutish, obstinate race, in-
capable either of acquiring religious knowledge,
or of being trained to the functions of social life.
The other, full of pious concern for their conver-
sion, contended that, though rude and 'ignorant,
they were gentle, affectionate, docile, and by pro-
per intrudtions and regulations might be formed
gradually into good Christians and useful citi-
zens. This controversy, as I have already re-
lated, was carried on with all the warmth which
is natural, when attention to interest on the one
hand, and religious zeal on the other, animate
the dilputants. Most of the laity elpouf:ed the
former opinion ; all the ecclefialtics were advo-
cates for the latter; and we shall uniformly find

habitants attracted, in any considerable degree,
the attention of philosophers. At length, they
discovered that the contemplation of the condi-
tion and character of the Americans in their ori.
ginal state, tended to complete our knowledge
of the human species, might enable us to fill up
a considerable chafrn in the history of its progress,
and lead to speculations no less curious than im-
portant. They entered upon this new field of
study with great ardour; but, instead of throw-
ing light upon the subject, they have contributed,
in lome degree, to involve it in additional obfcu-
rity. Too impatient to inquire, they haflened
to decide; and began to erect fyflems, when
they Ihould have been fearcling for satis on
which to ctlablilh their foundations. Struck

Iith the appearance of degeneracy in the human B oo K
species throughout the New World, and afto- . j
nilhed at beholding a valt continent occupied
by a naked, feeble, and ignorant race of men,
some authors of great name have maintained,
that this part of the globe had but lately
emerged from the sea, and become fit for the
residence of man; that every thing in it bore
marks of a recent original; and that its inha-
bitants, lately called into existence, and frill at
the beginning of their career, were unworthy to
be compared with the people of a more ancient
and improved continent '. Others have ima-
gined, that, under the influence of an unkindly
climate, which checks and enervates the prin-
ciple of life, man never attained in America
the perfection which belongs to his nature, but
remained an animal of an inferior order, de-
fective in the vigour of his bodily frame, and
destitute of sensibility, as well as of force, in
the operations of his mind ". In opposition to
both there, other philosophers have supposed
that man arrives at his highest dignity and ex-
cellence long before he reaches a ifate of refine-
ment; and, in the rude simplicity of savage
life, displays an elevation of sentiment, an in-

conlider that as the most perfect fiate of man

reft of the species. These contradictory theo.
ries have been proposed with equal confidence,
and uncommon powers of genius and eloquence
have been exerted, in order to clothe them with
an appearance of truth.

As all those circumstances concur in render.

ing an inquiry into the slate of the rude nations

to carry it on with caution. When guided in
our researches by the intelligent observations of
the few philosophers who have visited this part

than that of any other animal. Some animals
are confined to a particular region of the globe,
and cannot exist beyond it; others, though they
may be brought to bear the injuries of a cli.
mate foreign to them, cease to multiply when
carried out of that diftri&t which Nature
destined to be their mansion. Even filch as
seem capable of being naturalized in various
climates, feel the effe6 of every remove from
their proper station, and gradually dwindle and
degenerate from the vigour and perfection pe.
culiar to their species. Man is the only living
creature whose frame is at once so hardy and so
flexible, that he can spread over the whole earth,
become the inhabitant of every region, and
thrive and multiply under every climate. Sub-

he human body is not entirely exempt from the A _
peration of climate; and when exposed to the
tremes either of heat or cold, its size or vigour

THE first appearance of the inhabitants of the Complefion,

ionifhment, that they were apt to imagine
em a race of men different from those of the
ther hemisphere. Their complexion is of a
eddih brown, nearly resembling the colour of

lack, long, coarse, and lank. They have no
eard, and every part of their body is perfectly
mooth. Their persons are of a full size, ex-
remely strait, and well proportioned z. Their

onfirmation Of this suspicion. The quantity of
sod which men consume varies according to the
temperature of the climate in which they live,
the degree of activity which they exert, and the
natural vigour of their constitutions. Under the
enervating heat of the torrid zone, and when
men pals their days in indolence and ease, they
require less nourilhment than the active inhabi-
tants of temperate or cold countries. But neither
the warmth of their climate, nor their extreme la-
zinefs, will account for the uncommon defet of

hat on which many philosophers reft as a full
xplanation of the singular appearances which
ave been mentioned. Wherever the state of
ociety is such as to create many wants and de-
res, which cannot be satisfied without regular
xertions of industry, the body accustomed to
abour becomes robust and patient of fatigue.
n a more simple state, where the demands of
en are so few and so moderate, that they may
e gratified, almost without any effort, by the
ontaneous productions of nature, the powers
the body are not called forth, nor can they
ttain their proper strength. The natives of
hili and of North-America, the two temperate
egions in the New World, who live by hunt-
ng, may be deemed an ative and vigorous
ace, when compared with the inhabitants of
he isles, or of those parts of the continent
here hardly any labour is requisite to procure
bfiftence. The exertions of a hunter are not,
owever, so regular, or so continued, as thole
fperfons employed in the culture of thz earth,
r in the various arts of civilized life, and
hough his agility may be greater than theirs,
is strength is on the whole inferior. If another
ireWion were given to the active powers of
<an in the New World, and his force aui-

t-y-. of vigour which he does not in his present fiat

possess. The truth of this is confirmed by ex
perience. Wherever the Americans have beer
gradually accuflomed to hard labour, thei
constitutions become robust, and they have beei
found capable of performing such talks, a
seemed not only to exceed the powers of fuchi
feeble frame as has been deemed peculiar t
their country, but to equal any effort of thi
natives, either of Africa or of Europe '.

THE fame reasoning will apply to what hai

been observed concerning their slender demand
for food. As a proof that this should be ascribed
as much to their extreme indolence, and often
total want of occupation, as to any thing pecu.
liar in the physical ftruture of their bodies, il
has been observed, that in those diftridts, whert
the people of America are obliged to exert any
unusual effort of acivity, in order to procure
subsistence, or wherever they are employed in
severe labour, their appetite is not inferior to
that of other men, and, in some places, it ha
struck observers as remarkably voracious k.

THE operation of political and moral causes B o K
still more conspicuous, in modifying the de- L.y-
ree of attachment between the sexes. In a
ate of high civilization, this paflion, inflamed
y restraint, refined by delicacy, and cherished
y fashion, occupies and engrosses the heart.
t is no longer a simple inftin& of nature; fen-
iment heightens the ardour of desire, and the
oft tender emotions of which our frame is sus-
eptible, soothe and agitate the foul. This
efcription, however, applies only to those,
ho, by their situation, are exempted from
he cares and labours of life. Among persons
of inferior order, who are doomed by their con-
ition to incessant toil, the dominion of this
affion is less violent; their solicitude to procure
fubfittence, and to provide for the first demand
of nature, leaves little leisure for attending to
its second call. But if the nature of the inter-
course between the sexes varies so much in per-
sons of different rank in polished societies, the
condition of man, while he remains uncivilized,
must occasion a variation still more apparent.
We may well suppose, that amidfl the hard-
ships, the dangers, and the simplicity of savage
life, where subsistence is always precarious, and
often scanty, where men are almost continually
engaged in the pursuit of their enemies, or in
guarding against their attacks, and where neither

.--ry-.. allurement, that the attention of the Americans

to their women would be extremely feeble,
without imputing this solely to any physical de.
fe or degradation in their frame.

IT is accordingly observed, that in those

countries of America, where, from the fertility
of the loil, the mildness of the climate, or
some farther advances which the natives have
made in improvement, the means of subsistence
are more abundant, and the hardlhips of savage
life are less Leverely felt, the animal paflion of
the sexes becomes more ardent. Striking ex-
amples of this occur among some tribes feated
on the banks of great rivers well stored with
food, among others who are mailers of hunting-
grounds abounding so much with game, that
they have a regular and plentiful supply of
nourinlment with little labour. The superior
degree of security and affluence which there
tribes enjoy, is followed by their natural effeis.
The pafrfons implanted in the human frame by
the hand of nature acquire additional torce;
new taftes and desires are formed; the women,
as they are more valued and admired, becone
more attentive to drels and ornament; the
men, beginning to feel how much of their own
happincfs depends upon them, no longer disdain

the

e arts of winning their favour and affetio. Bs o K.
he intercourse of the sexes becomes very dif- t.---..
rent from that which takes place among their
uder countrymen; and as hardly any restraint is
npofed on the gratification of desire, either by
ligion, or laws, or decency, the dissolution of
eir manners is excessive .

NOTWITHSTANDING the feeble make of the Noneof
mericans, hardly any of them are deformed, formed.
mutilated, or defective in any of their senses.
11 travellers have been struck with this cir.
umfiance, and have celebrated the uniform
mmetry and perfection of their external figure.
ome authors search for the cause of this ap-
earance in their physical condition. As the
arents are not exhausted or over-fatigued with
ard labour, they fuppofc that their children
e born vigorous and found. They imagine,
hat in the liberty of savage life, the human
oiy, naked and unconfined from its earliest

ion, than when fettered with artificial reltraints,

F 4 Something,

B O OK Something, without doubt, may be ascribed

cLc to the operation of these causes; but the true

reasons of this apparent advantage, which is
common to all savage nations, lie deeper, and
are closely interwoven with the nature and ge.
nius of that state. The infancy of man is so
long and so helplcfs, that it is extremely diffi.
cult to rear children among rude nations. Their
means of subsistence are not only scanty, but
precarious. Such as live by hunting mud
range over extensive countries, and shift often
from place to place. The care of children, as
well as every other laborious talk, is devolved
upon the women. The distresses and hardships
of the savage life, which are often such as can
hardly be supported by persons in full vigour,
mutt be fatal to those of more tender age,
Afraid of undertaking a talc so laborious, and
of such long duration, as that of rearing their
offspring, the women, in some parts of Ame.
rica, procure frequent abortions by the use of
certain herbs, and extinguish the first sparks of
that life which they are unable to cherish .
Sensible that only flout and well formed children
have force of conflitution to firuggle through
such an hard infancy, other nations abandon or

destroy such of their progeny as appear feeble or B o oK
defe6ive, as unworthy of attention °. Even when .O
they endeavour to rear all their children without
diftin&tion, so great a proportion of the whole
number perishes under the rigorous treatment
which must be their lot in the savage state, that
few of those who laboured under any original
frailty attain the age of manhood P. Thus, in
polished Societies, where the means of subsistence
are secured with certainty, and acquired with
ease; where the talents of.the mind are often
of more importance than the powers of the
body; children are preserved notwithstanding
their defe&s or deformity, and grow up to be
useful citizens. In rude nations, such persons
are either cut off as soon as they are born, or
becoming a burden to themselves and to the
community, cannot long protract their lives.
But in those provinces of the New World
where, by the establishment of the Europeans,
more regular provision has been made for the
fubfiltence of its inhabitants, and they are re-
itrained from laying violent hands on their
children, the Americans are so far from being
eminent for any superior perfection in their
form, that one should rather suspect some pe-

there is lets variety in the human form through.

coverers firfl visited the different countries of
America which lie within the torrid zone, they
naturally expeced to find people of the fame
complexion with those in the corresponding
regions of the other hemj4phere. To their
amazement, however, they discovered that
America contained no negroes r; and the caule
of this singular appearance became as much the
obje& of curiosity, as the saC itself was of
wonder. In what part or membrane of the
body that humour resides which tinges the
complexion of the negro with a deep black, it
is the business of anatomists to inquire and
describe. The powerful operation of heat ap-
pears manifestly to be the cause which pro-
duces this firiking variety in the human fpe-
cies. All Europe, almolt the whole of Asia,
and the temperate parts of Africa, are occu-

ped by men of a fair complexion. All the BS °K
orrid zone in Africa, rome of the warmer --
regions adjacent to it, and a few countries in

fia, are filled with people of a deep black
colour. If we trace the nations of our conti-
nent, making our progress from cold and tem-
perate countries towards those parts which are
exposed to the influence of vehement and un,
remitting heat, we shall find, that the extreme
whiteness of their ikin soon begins to diminish,
that its colour deepens gradually as we ad-
vance; and after pasing through all the fuc-
ceflive gradations of Ihade, terminates in an
uniform unvarying black. But in America,
where the agency of heat is checked and
abated by various causes, which I have already
explained, the climate seems to be destitute of
that force which produces such wonderful eTfets
on the human frame. The colour of the na-
tives of the torrid zone, in America, is hardly
of a deeper hue than that of the people in the
more temperate parts of their continent. Ac-
curate oblervers, who had an opportunity of
viewing the Americans in very different cli-
mates, and in provinces far removed from each
other, have been itruck with the amazing fimi-
larity of their figure and alped '.

B O K BUT though the hand of Nature has deviated

IV.
.-v--.a so little from one standard in fashioning the

human form in America, the creation of fancy
hath been various and extravagant. The fame
fables that were current in the ancient conti.
nent, have been revived with refpeat to the
New World, and America too has been peopled
with human beings of monstrous and fantastic
appearance. The inhabitants of certain pro.
vinces were described to be pigmies of three
feet high; those of others to be giants of an
enormous size. Some travellers published ac.
counts of people with only one eye, others
pretended to have discovered men without
heads, whose eyes ahd mouths were planted in
their breasts. The variety of Nature in her
produEtions is, indeed, so great, that it is pre-
sumptuous to set bounds to her fertility, and
to rejec indiscriminately every relation that
does not perfeEtly accord with our own limited
observation and experience. But the other ex-
treme, of yielding a hasty assent, on the flighted
evidence, to whatever has the appearance of
being firange and marvellous, is no less unbe-
coming a philosophical inquirer, as, in every
period, men are more apt to be betrayed into
error, by their weakness in believing too
much, than by their arrogance in believing
too little. In proportion as science extends,

and

and nature is examined with a discerning eye, B 00 K
the wonders which arnufed ages of ignorance -N
disappear. The tales of credulous travellers
concerning America are forgotten; the mon-
sers which they describe have been searched
for in vain; and those provinces where they
pretend to have found inhabitants of singular
forms, are now known to be possessed by peo-
ple no wife different from the other Ameri-
cans.

THOUGH those relations may, without dif-
cullion, be reje&ed as fabulous, there are other
accounts of varieties in the human species in
some parts of the New World, which reft upon
better evidence, and merit more attentive exa-
mination. This variety has been particularly
observed in three different diftriEts. The first
of these is situated in the isthmus of Darien,
near the centre of America. Lionel Wafer, a
traveller p'offiefed of more curiosity and intel-
ligence than we should have expected to find
in an associate of Buccaneers, discovered there
a race of men few in number, but of a singular
make. They are of low fature, according to
his description, of a feeble frame, incapable of
enduring fatigue. Their colour is a dead milk
white; not rcfembling that of fair people among

Europeans,

B o K Europeans, but without any ticn:tire- of a blul

AV.
4*m.tJ or sanguine complexion. Their skin is covered

with a fine hairy down of a chalky white, the
hair of their heads, their eye-brows, and eye.
lathes, are of the fame hue. Their eyes are ofa
singular form, and so weak, that they can hardly
bear the light of the fun; but they fee clearly
by moon-light, and are most active and gay in
the night ". No race similar to this has been
discovered in any other part of America,
Cortes, indeed, found some persons exaftly
resembling the white people of Darien, among
the rare and monstrous animals which Monte.
zuma had collected w. But as the power of
the Mexican empire extended to the provinces
bordering on the isthmus of Darien, they were
probably brought from thence. Singular as
the appearance of those people may be, they
cannot be confidered as constituting a ditind
species. Among the negroes of Africa, as well
as the natives of the Indian iflards, nature
sometimes produces a frall number of indivi.
duals, with all the charafteriftic features and
qualities of the white people of Darien. The
former are called Albinos by the Portuguese,

he parents of those Whites are of the fame '*'
olour with the other natives of the country;
nd this observation applies equally to the
nomalous progeny of the negroes and Indians.
The fame mother who produces some children
f a colour that does not belong to the race,
brings forth the r fit of the complexion pecu-
liar to her country x. One conclusion may
hen be formed with refpe& to the people de-
cribed by Wafer, the Albinos and the Kacker-
lakes; they are a degenerated breed, not a
separate class of men; and from some disease
or defect of their parents, the peculiar colour
and debility which mark their degradation are
transmitted to them. As a decisive proof of
this, it has been observed, that neither the
white people of Darien, nor the Albinos of
Africa, propagate their race: their children
are of the colour and temperament peculiar to
the natives of l;eir respective countries Y.

Thele are the famous Patagonians, who, du- ! -a-
ring two centuries and a half, have afforded a
fubjt& of controvcrty to the learned, and an

i:ppofed to be one of the wandering tribes,
which occupy that vast, but least known region
of America, which extends from the river De

proper ltation is in that part of the interior
country which lies on the banks of the river

ronam as far as the straits which separate Tierra

scribed them as a gigantic race, above eight

diftinguilhed by a superiority of size and vigour,
far beyond what he has reached in any other
part of the earth. The molt explicit and un.
exceptionable evidence is requisite, in order to
establish a fact, repugnant to those general
principles and laws, which seem to affect the
human frame in every other instance, and to
decide with relpeRt to its nature and qualities,
Such evidence has not hitherto been produced,
Though several persons, to whose testimony
great respect is due, have visited this part of
America since the time of Magellan, and have
had interviews with the natives; though some
have affirmed, that such as they saw were of
gigantic stature, and others have formed the
fame conclusion from measuring their footfleps,
or from viewing the fleletons of their dead;
yet their accounts vary from each other in so
many essential points, and are mirlecd with Io
many circum(tances manifetly falti or fabu-
lous, as detract much from their credit. On
the o-her hand, some navi;acors, and thlof
among the molt eminent of their order Ior
dilcernment and accuracy, have afftrted that

the

he natives of Patagonia, with whom they had B 00 K
intercourse, though flout and well-made, are -
not of such extraordinary size as to be diftin-
gui/hed from the reft of the human species b.
The existence of this gigantic race of men
seems, then, to be one of those points in
natural history, with refpec to which a cautious
nquirer will hesitate, and will chute to suspend
his assent until more complete evidence shall
ecide, whether he ought to admit a fact,
eemingly inconsistent with what reason and
experience have discovered concerning the
tructure and condition of man, in all the
various situations in which he has been ob-
erved.

IN order to form a complete idea with re- Their flat
pe&t to the constitution of the inhabitants of
this and the other hemisphere, we ihould
attend not only to the make and vigour of
their bodies, but conrider what degree of health
they enjoy, and to what period of longevity
they usually arrive. In the simplicity of the
savage rfate, when man is not oppressed with
labour, or enervated by luxury, or disquieted
with care, we are apt to imagine that his life

according to the diversity of climates, and their
different modes of subsistence. They seem, how.

reembles in his mode of life, more violent, B oo K
and more fatal. If luxury engenders and nou-
rihes diatempers of one fpecics, the rigour and
ditreffes of savage life bring on those of another.
As men, in this state, are wonderfully improvi-
denr, and their means of subsistence precarious,
they often pass from extreme want to exuberant
plenty, according to the viciflitudes of fortune
n the chace, or in consequence of the various
degree of abundance with which the earth as-
rords to them its productions, in different sea-
aons. Their inconsiderate gluttony in the one
Jituation, and their severe abf'inence in the other,
arc equally pernicious. For, though the human
conflitution may Le acculfomed by habit, like
that of animals of prey, to tolerate long famine,
:-d then to gorge voraciously, it is not a little
afleed by fucli sudden and violent transitions.
'Ihe strength and vigour of savages are, at
f')ne seasons, impaired by what they susser
i;oin scarcity of food; at others, they are
aiftlited with disorders arising from indigeflion
and a superfluity of grols aliment. Thele are
sO common, that they may be confidered as

hardships and fatigue violently assault the con.
flitution. In polished societies, intemperance
undermines it. It is not ealy to determine
which of them operates with most fatal efFct,
or tends most to abridge human life. The
influence of the former is certainly most exten.
five. The pernicious consequences of luxury
reach only a few members in any community,
the distresses of savage life are felt by all. As
far as I can judge, after very minute inquiry,
the general period of human life is fliorter among
savages, than in well-regulated and industrious
societies.

to baffle all the efforts of medical skill. Afto-

of infancy, during which several powers of the

of society, while the condition of man is fiiplc

his desires move within a very narrow fpherc.

is perfectly indifferent to him. Like a mere

There are many who cannot reckon farther than
three; and have no denomination to distinguish

as far as ten, others to twenty. When they
would convey an idea of any number beyond

wants and appetites. These are numerous and B o K
importunate; they keep the mind in perpetual I_
agitation, and, in order to gratify them, inven-
tion must be always on the stretch, and industry
mutt be incessantly employed. But the desires
of simple nature are few, and where a favour-
able climate yields almoff fpontaneoufy what
suffices to gratify them, they scarcely stir the
foul, or excite any violent emotion. Hence the
people of several tribes in America waste their
ife in a listless indolence. To be free from oc-
cupation, seems to be all the enjoyment towards
which they aspire. They will continue whole

SUCH is their aversion to labour, that neither Improvi.

licitude, and taking no precautions to avoid

previous precautions are taken, for securing e-.-

begun, and the laborious arm has made the
first essays of its power. Still, however, the
improvident and slothful genius of the savage
slate predominates. Even among those more
improved tribes, labour is deemed ignominious
and degrading. It is only to work of a certain
kind that a man will deign to put his hand.
The greater part is devolved entirely upon the
women. One half of the community remains
inaflive, while the other is oppressed with the
multitude and variety of its occupations. Thus
their industry is partial, and the foresight which
regulates it, is no less limited. A remarkable
inltance of this occurs in the chief arrangement
with refped to their manner of living. They
depend for their subsistence, during one part
of the year, on filhing; during another, on
hunting; during a third, on the produce of
their agriculture. Though experience has
taught them to foresee the return of those va-
rious seasons, and to make some provision for
the refpecive exigencies of each, they either
want sagacity to proportion this provision to
their consumption, or are so incapable of any
command over their appetites, that, from their
inconsiderate waste, they often feel the calami-

ease or difficulty of rearing their offspring.
Among those tribes where the season of infancy
is fhcrt, and the young soon acquire vigour or
agility, no permanent union is formed. Na-
ture commits the care of training up the
offspring to the mother alone, and her tender-
ness, without any other assistance, is equal to
the tafl. But where the Rtate of infancy is
long and helpless, and the joint afliduity of
both parents is requisite in tending their feeble
progeny, there a more intimate connection
takes place, and continues until the purpose of
nature be accomplished, and the new race grow
up to full maturity. As the infancy of man is
more feeble and helpless than that of any other
animal, and he is dependent, during a much
longer period, on the care and foresight of his
parents, the union between husband and wife
came early to be confidered, not only as a so-
lemn, but as a permanent contract, A ge-
ncral state of promiscuous intercourse between
the sexes never exifled but in the imagination
of poets. In the infancy of society, when men,
leflitute of arts and indultry, lead a hard pre-
carious life, the rearing of their progeny de-

continued with this view, the race could not
have been preserved. Accordingly, in Ameri.
ca, even among the rudest tribes, a regular
union between husband and wife was universal,
and the rights of marriage were understood and
recognized. In those diftriEts where fubfiuRence
was scanty, and the difficulty of maintaining a
family was great, the man confined himfelfto
one wife. In warmer and more fertile provinces,
the facility of procuring food concurred with dhe
influence of climate, in inducing the inhabitants
to increase the number of their wives '. In fomn
countries, the marriage union subsisted during
life; in others, the impatience of the Americans
under restraint of any species, together with their
natural levity and caprice, prompted them to
dissolve it on very flight pretexts, and often
without afligning any cause ".

ate, is a point which can admit of no doubt.
To despise and to degrade the female lex, is
he characteriflic of the savage slate in every
part of the globe. Man, proud of excelling
in strength and in courage, the chief marks
f pre-eminence among rude people, treats
woman, as an inferior, with disdain. The
Americans, perhaps from that coldness and in-
sensibility which has been confidercd as peculiar
to their confiitution, add neglect and harflnefs
to contempt. The mofi intelligent travellers
have been firuck with this inattention of the
Americans to their women. It is not, as I
have already observed, by a studied display of
tenderness and attachment, that the American
endeavours to gain the heart of the woman
whom he withes to marry. Marriage itiflf,
inltead of being an union of affcEion and in-
terests between equals, becomes, among them,
the unnatural conjunction of a mailter with his
nave. It is the obfcrvation of an author, whose

his wife of her parents. Though unacquainted

tranfacftions as take place in more improved lbo
ciety, he knows how to give an equivalent for
any object which he desires to posess. In Ibme
places, the suitor devotes his service for a certain
time to the parents of the maid whom he courts;
in others, he hunts for them occasionally, or afits
in cultivating their fields, and forming their ca-

confider her as a female lirvant whom he has --
purchaled, and whom he has a title to treat as

the functions in domestic ceconomy, which fall
naturally to the share of women, are so many,
that they are fubjeeed to hard labour, and must
bear more than their full portion of the com-
mon burden. But in America their condition
is so peculiarly grievous, and their deprefion
ib complete, that servitude is a name too mild
to describe their wretched Itate. A wife,
among most tribes, is no better than a beast of
burden, defined to every office of labour and
fatigue. While the men loiter out the day in
sloth, or spend it in amusement, the women
are condemned to incessant toil. Talks are
imposed upon them without pity, and services
are received without complacence or gratitude '.
Every circumltance reminds women of this
mortifying inferiority. They mutt approach

is not cherished by the continuance of atten.

excite it. Conscious of their own liberty, and
impatient of restraint, the youth of America
are accustomed to act as if they were totally
independent. Their parents are not objects
of greater regard than other persons. They
treat them always with neglect, and often with
such harshness and insolence, as to fill thoe
who have been witnesses of their conduct with
horror d. Thus the ideas which seem to be
natural to man in his savage state, as they
result from his circumstances and condition in
that period of his progress, affect the two
capital relations in domestic life. They render
the union between husband and wife unequal,
They shorten the duration, and weaken the
force, of the connecion between parents and

Hardly any region of the earth furnishes man
spontaneously w;th what his wants require.
In the mildest climates, and most fertile foils,
his own industry and foresight must be exerted,
in some degree, to secure a regular supply of
food. Their experience of this surmounts the
abhorrence of labour natural to savage nations,
and compels them to have recourse to culture,
as subsidiary to hunting. In particular fitua-
tions, some small tribes may subsist by fishing,
independent of any production of the earth,
raised by their own industry. But throughout
all America, we scarcely meet with any nation
of hunters, which does not practise some species
of cultivation.

grain extremely prolific, of simple culture,

here is nothing marvellous. One species of Boo K
anioc is altogether free of any poisonous ---
uality, and may be eaten without any prepa-
ration but that of roasting it in the embers.
This, it is probable, was first used by the
Americans as food; and necessity having gra-
dually taught them the art of separating its
pernicious juice from the other species, they
have by experience found it to be more pro-
lific as well as more nourifhingq. The third
is the plantain, which though it rites to the
height of a tree, is of such quick growth, that
in less than a year it rewards the industry of
the cultivator, with its fruit. This, when
roasted, supplies the place of bread, and is
both palatable and nourifhingr. The fourth
is the potatoe, whose culture and qualities are
too well known to need any description. The
fifth is pimento, a small tree, yielding a strong
aromatic spice. The' Americans, who, like
other inhabitants of warm climates, delight in
whatever is hot and of poignant flavour, deem
this leafoning a necessary of life, and mingle
it copiouly with every kind of food they
take .

Such was the condition of all the rude nations --
in America. Their reason was so little im-

they fcem not to have been conscious of the

animal creation to retain its liberty, without

his civilized state, is so accultomed to the ser.
vice of the domestic animals, that he seldom
reflets upon the vast benefits which he derives
from it. If we were to suppose him, even when

ministry, his empire over nature must in some i
measure cease, and he would remain a feeble
animal, at a loss how to subsist, and incapable
of attempting such arduous undertakings as their
affiaance enables him to execute with ease.

IT is a doubtful point, whether the dominion Want of the

useful me-

of man over the animal creation, or his ac- tas..
quiring the use of metals, has contributed most
to extend his power. The aera of this import-
ant discovery is unknown, and in our hemi-
sphere very remote. It is only by tradition, or
by digging up some rude instruments of our
forefathers, that we learn that mankind were
originally unacquainted with the use of metals,
and endeavoured to supply the want of them by
employing flints, shells, bones, and other hard
substances, for the fame purposes which metals
serve among polilhed nations. Nature com-
pletes the formation of some metals. Gold,
silver, and copper, are found in their perfect
state, in the clefts of rocks, in the fides of
mountains, or the channels of rivers. These
were accordingly the metals firEf known, and
first applied to use. But iron, the most ser.
viceable of all, and to which man is most in-
debted, is never discovered in its perse& form ;
its gross and flubborn ore must feel twice the

a-__- cesses, before it become fit for uie. Man was

long acquainted with the other metals, before
he acquired the art of fabricating iron, or at.
rained such ingenuity as to perfect an invention,
to which he was indebted for those inftrumeats
wherewith he subdues the earth, and commands
all its inhabitants. But in this, as well as in
many other refpeEts, the inferiority of the
Americans was conspicuous. All the savage
tribes, scattered over the continent and islands,
were totally unacquainted with the metals which
their foil produces in great abundance, if we
except tome trifling quantity of gold, which
they picked up in the torrents that descendcd
from their mountains, and formed into orna.
ments. Their devices to supply this want of
the serviceable metals, were extremely rude and
awkward. The mos simple operation was to
them an undertaking of immense difficulty anil
labour. To fell a tree with no other inftru.
ments than hatchets of flone, was employment
for a month F. To form a canoe into flhpe,
and to hollow it, consumed years; and it fie-

equally flow and defective. In a country BOO K
covered with woods of the hardest timber, the L-- _
clearing of a small field destined for culture re-
quired the united efforts of a tribe, and was a
work of much time and great toil. This was
the business of the men, and their indolence
was satisfied with performing it in a very
slovenly manner. The labour of cultivation
was left to the women, who, after digging, or
rather stirring the field, with wooden mattocks,
and stakes hardened in the fire, sowed or planted
it; but they were more indebted for the increake
to the fertility of the loil, than to their own
rude industry h.

AGRICULTURE, even when the strength of

man is seconded by that of the animals which
he has subjected to the yoke, and his power:
augmented by the use of the various instruments
with which the discovery of metals has fumrnifhed
him, is still a work of great labour; and it is
with the sweat of his brow that he renders the
earth fertile. It is not wonderful, then, that
people deltitute of both these advantages should
have made so little progress in cultivation, that

i. Divided i., THEY were divided into small independent
into small
communi. communities. While hunting is the chief

source of subsistence, a vast extent of territory
is requisite for supporting a small number of
people. In proportion as men multiply and
unite, the wild animals, on which they depend
for food, diminish, or fly at a greater distance
from the haunts of their enemy. The increase
of a society in this ftatd is limited by its own
nature, and the members of it muff either dif.
perse, like the game which they pursue, or fall
upon tome better method of procuring food, than
by hunting. Bealts of prey are by nature soli-
tary and unsocial, they go not forth to the chafe
in herds, but delight in those receifes of the forest
where they can roam and destroy undisturbed.

a distance every rival who may encroach otf those
domains, which they confider as their own. This
was the state of all the American tribes, the num-
bers in each were inconsiderable, though scattered
over vast countries ; they were far removed from
one another, and engaged in perpetual hostilities or
rivalfhip '. In America, the word nation is not of
the fame import as in other parts of the globe. It
is applied to small focicties, not exceeding, per-
haps, two or three hundred persons, but occupying
provinces larger than rome kingdoms in Europe.

bred under his infpeaion, nor nourihfed by his
care, he can claim no right to them, while they run
wild in the forest. Where game is so plentiful that
it may be catched with little trouble, men never
dream of appropriating what is of small value,
or of easy acquisition. Where it is so rare, that the
labour or danger of the chafe requires the united
efforts of a tribe, or village, what is killed is a
common frock, belonging equally to all, who, by
their ikill or their courage, have contributed to the
success of the excursion. The forest, or hunting-
grounds, are deemed the property of the tribe,
from which it has a title to exclude every rival na-
tion. But no individual arrogates a right to any
diftri&t of there, in preference to his fellow-citi-
zens. They belong alike to all; and thither, as
to a general and undivided store, all repair in quell
of sustenance. The fame principles by which they
regulate their chief occupation, extend to that
which is subordinate. E'ven agriculture has not

joy his natural independence almost entire. If a
scheme of public utility be proposed, the members
of the community are left at liberty to chufe whe-
ther they will assist or not in carrying it into execu.
tion. No statute imposes any service as a duty, no
compulsory laws oblige them to perform it. All
their resolutions are voluntary, and flow from the
impulse of their own mindsz. The first tfep to.
wards establishing a public jurifdi&tion has not been
taken in those rude societies. The right of revenge
is left in private hands : If violence is committed,
or blood is shed, the community does not assume
the power either of infliting or of moderating the
punishment. It belongs to the family and friends of
the person injured or slain to avenge the wrong, or
to accept of the reparation offered by the aggressor,
If the elders interpose, it is to advise, not to decide,

SUCH was the form of political order eftablifled To what

among the greater part of the American nations. In peoleptions
this fate were almolt all the tribes, spread over apply.
the vast provinces extending eastward of the Mif-
fiffppi, from the mouth of the St. Laurence to
the confines of Florida. In a similar condition were
the people of Brasil, the inhabitants of Chili, feve-
ral tribes in Paraguay and Guiana, and in the coun-
tries which stretch from the mouth of the Orinoco
to the peninsula of Yucatan. Among such an in-
finite number of petty associations, there may be pe.
cuiiarities which conilitute adiftincqtion, and mark the
various degrees of their civilization and improve-
ment. But an attempt to trace and enumerate these
would be vain, as they have not been observed by
perlbns capable of discerning the minute and deli-
cate circumtfances, which serve to discriminate na-
tons resembling one another in their general charac-
ter and features. The description which I have
given will apply, with little variation, to the policy
of every people in America, which has advanced
no farther in civilization, than to add tome slender
degree of agriculture to fishing and hunting.

among those people of America, whom I have in- -^-J
eilued under the common denomination of savage.
There are so curious and important that I llall de-
lcribe them, and attempt to explin their origin.

IN the New World, as well as in other parts of iPltoilerly

the globe, cold or temperate countries appear to be 'hewarmer
the favourite feat of freedom and independence.
There the mind, like the body, is firm and vigo-
rous. There men, conscious of their own dignity,
and capable of the greatctl efforts in alferting it,
aspire to independenle, and their stubborn spirits
stoop with reluctance to the yoke offervitude. In
warmer climates, by whose infue ice the whole frame
is so much enervated, that prcfent plealure is the
supreme felicity, and mere repose is enjoyment,
men acquiesce, almolt without a struggle, in the
dominion of a superior. Accordingly, if we pro.
ceed from north to south along the continent of
America, we f)all find the power of tholt velted
with authority gradually increasing, and the spirit
of the people becoming more tame and pafive. In
Florida, the authority of the sachems, caziques, or
chiefs, was not only permanent, but hereditary.
They were diltinguifhed by peculiar ornaments, they
enjoyed pierogativcs of various kinds, and were
treated by their subjects with that reverence, which

a mp__, difference of rank took place, with which the north.

ern tribes were altogether unacquainted. Some fa.
milies were reputed noble, and enjoyed hereditary
dignity. The body of the people was confidered as
vile, and formed only for fubjecóion. This diltinc.
tion was marked by appellations which intimat:d
the high elevation of the one state, and the igno.
miniots deprefion of the other. The former were
called Refpeaable; the latter, the Stinkards. The
great Chief, in whom the supreme authority was
vested, is reputed to be a being of superior na.
ture, the brother of the Sun, the sole object of their
worship. They approach this great Chief with re.
ligious veneration, and honour him as the repre.
fentative of their dei:y. His will is a law, to which
all submit with implicit obedience. The lives of
his fubjets are so ablblutely at his disposal, that if
any one has incurred his displeasure, the offender
comes with profound humility and offers him his
head. Nor does the dominion of the Chiefs end
with their lives; their principal officers, their fa.
vourite wives, together with many doneftics of in-
ferior rank, are sacrificed at their tombs, that they
may be attended in the next world by the fame per.

IT is not easy to point out the circumstances, or Causes of
todifcover the causes which contributed to introduce i'rpfap'eg
and etablifh among each of those people a form of ance'
government so different from that of the tribes
around them, and so repugnant to the genius of
rude nations. If the perobns who had an opportu-
nity of observing them in their original ltate, had
been more attentive and more discerning, we might
have received information from their conquerors sus-
ficient to guide us in this enquiry. If the tranfac-
tionsof people, unacquainted with the use of let-
ters, were not involved in impenetrable obscurity,
we might have derived some information from this
domestic source. But as nothing fatisfacory can
be gathered, either from the accounts of the Spa-
niards, or from their own traditions, we must have
!recourse to conjecures, in order to explain the irre-
gular appearances in the political state of the people
whom I have mentioned. As all those tribes which
had loft their native liberty and independence were
leated in the Torrid Zone, or in countries approach-
ing to it, the climate may be supposed to have had
some influence in forming their minds to that fervi-
tule, which seems to be the destiny of man in those
regions of the globe. But though the influence of
climate, more powerful than that of any other na-
tural cause, is not to be overlooked; that alone
cannot be admitted as a solution of the point in
quetion. The operations of men are so complex,

ants of the islands, rendered them so incapableof
the sentiments or efforts necessary for maintaining
independence, that there is no occasion to search for
any other cause of their tame submission to the
will of a superior. The fubjecion of the Natchez,
and of the people of Bogota, seems to have been
the consequence of a difference in their state from
that of the other Americans. They were fettled

citizens. Motives, with which rude nations are

equally

equally unacquainted, induce the people to fuibmit B 0 o
tamely to the usurped authority of their superiors. _
But even among nations in this state, the spirit of
fubjets could not have been rendered so obsequious,
or the power of rulers so unbounded, without the
intervention of fuperilition. By its fatal influence,
the human mind, in every stage of its progress, is
depressed, and its native vigour and independence
subdued. Whoever can acquire the direction: of
this formidable engine, is secure of dominion over
his species. Unfortunately for the people whose in-
fiitutions are the fibjed of inquiry, this power was
in the hands of their chiefs. The caziques of the
isles could put what relponfes they pleased into the
mouths of their Cewis or gods ; and it was by their
interposition, and in their name, that they imposed
any tribute or burden on their people h. The fame
power and prerogative was exercised by the great
chief of the Natchez as the principal minister as well
as the representative of the Sun, their deity. The
refpe& which the people of Bogota paid to their mo-
narchs, was likewise inspired by religion, and the
heir apparent of the kingdom was educated in the
innermost recess of their principal- temple, under
such austere discipline, and with fich peculiar rites,
as tended to fill his ltbjedts with high sentiments
concerning the Iandtity of his charadler, and the
dignity of his station '. Thus superstition, which,
in the rudest period of society, is either altogether
unknown, or waftes its force in childish unmeaning
pratices, had acquired such an ascendant over those

BUT interest is not either the moRs frequent or Theirmo-

the molt powerful motive of the inceflnt hotlili- g:g.ingin

Circumflances of powerful influence, both in the
interior government of rude tribes, and in their
external operations against foreign enemies, con-

every individual, injuries are felt with exquisite
sensibility, and vengeance exerciscd with unrelent-

of an offence, and it is fcldom that it can be ex-

and pursuits. The deilre of vengeance, which B o o K
takes pofTfelion of the heart of savages, rerembles x--..
the instinctive rage of an animal, rather than the
paflion of a man. It turns, with undifcerning fury,
even againlt inanimate objects. If hurt accidentally
by a Itone, they often fcize it in a transport of
anger, and endeavour to wreak their vengeance
upon it o. If struck with an arrow in battle, they
will tear it from the wound, break and bite it with
their teeth, and dash it on the ground P. With re-
fpeEt to their enemies, the rage of vengeance knows
no bounds. When under the dominion of this
pafion, man becomes the most cruel of all animals.
He neither pities, nor forgives, nor spares.

THE force of this pafTion is so well underflood

by the Americans themfclves, that they always ap-
ply to it, in order to excite their people to take
arms. If the elders of any tribe attempt to rouze
their youth from sloth, if a chief wishes to allure a
band of warriors to follow him in invading an
enemy's country, the most persuasive topics of
their martial eloquence are drawn from revenge.

attack, they collec their troops, and advance
with greater caution. Even in their hottest and
most active wars, they proceed wholly by stratagem
and ambuscade. They place not their glory in at-
tacking their enemies with open force, To furprifT
and destroy is the greatest merit of a commander,
and the highet pride of his followers. War and
hunting are their only occupations, and they con-
duct both with the fame spirit and the fame arts.
They follow the track of their enemies through the
forest. They endeavour to discover their haunts,
they lurk in tome thicket near to these, and, with
the patience of a sportsman lying in wait for game,
will continue in their station day after day, until
they can rufli upon their prey when most secure, and
least able to resist them. If they meet no straggling
party of the enemy, they advance towards their
villages, but with such solicitude to conceal their
own approach, that they often creep on their hands
and feet through the woods, and paint their skins of
the fame colour with the withered leaves, in order
to avoid detection y. If so fortunate as to remain
unobserved, they set on fire the enemies huts in the
dead of night, and mafhacre the inhabitants, as
they fly naked and defencelcfs from the flames. It

which is natural to men, who, having no idea of
war but that of exterminating their enemies, never

of the captive to the utmost proof. A scene en.
sues, the bare description of which is enough to
chill the heart with horror, wherever men have
been accustomed, by milder intfitutions, to refpe.:
their species, and to melt into tenderners at tle
fight of human sufferings. The prisoners are tied
naked to a flake, but so as to be at liberty to
move around it. All who are present, men, '.o.
men, and children, rush upon themn like furies.
Every species of torture is applied that the rancour
of revenge can invent. Some burn their limns
with red-hot irons, rome mangle their bodies wi:!
knives, others tear their flesh from their bones,
pluck out their nails by the roots, and rend and
twilt their fincws. They vie with one arrother in
refinements of torture. Nothing sets bounds to
their ragne but the drcad of abridging the duration
of their vcngeance by hallcning the death of the lif-

s~i';ciS;

rers; and such is their cruel ingenuity in tor- B 0 0 K
enting, that by avoiding industriously to hurt _
ny vital part, they often prolong this scene of
nguifi for several days. In spite of all that they
suser, the viEiims continue to chant their death-

xpl(its, they insult their tormentors for their
want of skill in avenging their friends and rela-
tions, they warn them of the vengeance which
awaits them on account of what they are now doing,
and excite their ferocity by the most provoking re-
proaches and threats. To dilplay undaunted forti-
tude in lfch dreadful situations, is the noblest
triumph of a warrior. To avoid the trial by a vo-
luntary death, or to flirink under it, is deemed
infamous and cowardly. If any one betray iymp-
toms of timidity, his tormentors often dispatch him
at once with contempt, as unworthy of being
treated like a man ms. Animated with tloif ideas,
they endure, without a gr)oan, what it teems almost
impofTible that human nature should sustain. They
appear to be not only insensible of pain, but to
court it. " Forbear," said an aged chief of the
Iroquois, when his inihlzs had provoked one of his
torn'c'tors to wound him with a knife, " for-
bear thie llftabs of your knife, and rather let me

great measure abolished this practice, it teems for-
merly to have been so well known, that it is
incorporated into the idiom of their language.
Among the Iroquois, the phrase by which they
express their resolution of making war againat an
enemy is, " Iet us go and eat that nation." If
they solicit the aid of a neighbouring tribe, they
invite it to " eat broth made of the flesh of their
enemies t." Nor was the practice peculiar to rude
unpolifhed tribes; the principle from which it took
rile is so deeply rooted in the minds of the Ame-
ricans, that it subsisted in Mexico, one of the
civilized empires in the New World, and relics of
it may be discovered among the more mild inha-
bitants of Peru. It was not scarcity of food, as
tome authors imagine, and the importunate crav-
ings of hunger, which forced the Americans to
those horrid repasts on their fellow-creatures. Hu-
man flesh was never used as common food in any
country, and the various relations concerning
people who reckoned it among the flated means
of subsistence, flow from the credulity and mif-
takes of travellers. Th'le rancour of revenge first
prompted men to this barbarous action . The
fiercerf tribes devoured none but prisoners taken
in war, or Iuch as they regarded as enemiesx.

deem the most complete and exquisite gratification

tives never escape death, but they are not tor-

As the conf'ancy of every American warrior may

be put to such severe proof, the great object of mi-
litary education and discipline in the New World is
to form the mind to sustain it. When nations
carry on war with open force, defy their enemies
to the combat, and vanquish them by the fupe-
riority of their skill or courage, soldiers are trained
to be active, vigorous, and enterprising. But in
America, where the genius and maxims of war
are extremely diffirenr, passive fortitude is the
quality in highest estimation. Accordingly, it is
early the Itudy of the Americans to acquire senti-
ments and habits, which will enable them to behave
like men, when their refblution shall be put to the
proof. As the youth of other nations exercifc them-
selves in feats of activity and force, tholi: of Ame-
rica vie with one another in exhibitions of their pa.

ary in America, when a youth is admitted into the
class of warriors, or when a warrior is promoted
to the dignity of captain or chief, are accommo.
dated to this idea of manliness. They are not dif-
plays of valour, but of patience; they are not ex-
hibitions of their ability to offend, but of their ca-
pacity to susser. Among the tribes on the banks
of the Orinoco, if a warrior aspires to the rank of
captain, his probation begins with a long fast, more
rigid than any ever observed by the most abfte.
mious hermit. At the close of this, the chiefs as-

whip, applied so vigorously, that his body is al.

of impatience or even sensibility, he is disgraced for
ever, and rejected as unworthy of the honour to
which he aspires. After some interval, the con.
Itancy of the candidate is proved by a more excru-
ciating trial. He is laid in a hammoc with his

venomous ants, whose bite occasions exquilite pain,
and produces a violent inflammation, are thrown

he suffers, would exclude him for ever from the y
rank of captain. Even after this evidence of his
fortitude, it is not deemed to be completely afcer-
tained, but must stand another refl more dreadful
than any he has hitherto undergone. sHe is again
suspended in his hammoc, and covered with leaves
of the palmetto. A fire of itinking herbs is kin-
died underneath, so as he may feel its heat, and be
involved in its smoke. Though scorched and al-
most suffocated, he must continue to endure with
the fame patient insensibility. Many perish in this
rude essay of their firmness and courage, but such
as go through it with applause, receive the ensigns
of their new dignity with much solemnity, and are
ever after regarded as leaders of approved refolu-
tion, whose behaviour, in the most trying fitua-
tions, will do honour to their country d. In North
America, the previous trial of a warrior is neither
so formal, nor so severe. Though even there, be-
fore a youth is permitted to bear arms, his patience
and fortitude are proved by blows, by fire, and by
insults, more intolerable to a haughty spirit than
both .

ricans endure the most exquisite torments, has in_

imperfect industry does not supply them with any
superfluous store of provisions; but when the irrup-

disturbs them in their hunting excursions, such a
calamity reduces a community, naturally unpro-

All the people of the diitriEt that is invaded, are
frequently forced to take refuge in woods or moun-

where many of them perish. Notwithstanding
their excelfive caution in conducing their mili-

to preserve the lives of his followers, as the rude
tribes in America fcldom enjoy any interval of

in proportion to the degree of population. Thus

no exchange of prisoners can ever take place. B o o K
From the moment one is made a prisoner, his c-
country and his friends confider him as dead k
He has incurred indelible disgrace by suffering
hinfelf to be surprised or to be taken by an
enemy; and were he to return home, after such a
slain upon his honour, his nearest relations would
not receive or even acknowledge that they knew
him'. Some tribes were frill more rigid, and if a
prisoner returned, the infamy which he had brought
on his country was expiated, by putting him in-
flantly to death m. As the unfortunate captive is
thus an outcast from his own country, and the
ties which bound him to it are irreparably broken,
he feels less reluctance in forming a new connection
with people, who, as an evidence of their friendly
sentiments, not only deliver him from a cruel
death, but offer to admit him to all the rights of
a fellow-citizen. The perfect similarity of man-
ners among savage nations facilitates and com-
pletes the union, and induces a captive to transfer
not only his allegiance, but his affection, to the
community into the bosom of which he is re-
ceived.

prove formidable to him by their conduct; and
whenever the contett is of long continuance,

and Mexico, though their progress in civilization,
when measured by the European or Asiatic stand-
ards, was inconsiderable, acquired such an ascend.
ancy over the rude tribes around them, that they
fubje&ed most of them with great facility to their
power. When the people of Europe over-ran the
various provinces of America, this superiority vwas
still more conspicuous. Neither the courage nor
number of the natives could repel a handful of in-
vaders. The alienation and enmity, prevalent
among barbarians, prevented them from uniting
in any common fchcme of defence, and while each
tribe fought Ifparattly, all were fiubdued.

which his body is affected, by the heat, or cold, I- _

and his first care will be, to provide some covering Drets and
for his own defence. In the warmer and more ornaments,
nild climates of America, none of the rude tribes
were clothed. To most of them Nature had not
even figgefted any idea of impropriety in being
altogether uncovered d. As under a mild climate
there was little need of any defence from the inju-
ris of the air, and their extreme indolence shun-
ned every species of labour to which it was not
urged by absolute necessity, all the inhabitants of
the ifes, and a considerable part of the people on
the continent, remained in this state of naked fim-
plicity. Others were satisfied with some flight
covering, such as decency required. But though
naked, they were not unadorned. They dresscd
their hair in many different forms. They fastened
bits of gold, or fhclls, or shining stones, in their
ears, their notes, and cheeks . They stained their
skins with a great variety of figures; and they
spent much time, and submitted to great pain, in
ornamenting their pcrlons in this fantastic manner.

of the American tribes. Their operations for that
purpose begin as soon as an infant is born. By comn.
pressing the bones of the fikll, while still soft and
flexible, some flatten the crown of their heads; some
squeeze them into the shape of a cone; others
mould them as much as polfible into a square
figure ; and they often endanger the lives of
their posterity by their violent and absurd es-
forts to derange the plan of Nature, or to im.
prove upon her designs. But in all their attempts
either to adorn or to new-model their persons, it
seems to have been less the object of the Americans
to please, or to appear beautiful, than to give aa
air of dignity and terror to their afpelt. Their at.
tention to drcfs had more reference to war than to
gallantry. The difference in rank and estimation be.
tween the two sexes was so great, as seems to have
extinguished, in some measure, their solicitude to
appear mutually amiable. The man deemed it be.

and simple ; whatever was precious or splendid was
reserved for the nien. In several tribes the women
were obliged to spend a considerable part of their
time every day in adorning and painting their hut-
bands, and could bestow little attention upon or-
namenting themselves. Among a race of men so
haughty as to despise, or so cold as to neglect
them, the wonmn naturally became carclefs and
slovenly, and the love of finery and flew, which
has been deemed their favourite paflion, was con-
fined chiefly to the other sex h. To deck his person
was the diftinfcion of a warrior, as well as one of
his moit serious occupations '. In one part of their
dress, which, at first fight, appears the molt fin-
gnulr and capricious, the Americans have disco-
vered considerable sagacity in providing against
the chief inconveniencies of their climate, which is
often sultry and moist to excess. All the different
tribes, which remain unclothed, are accuflomed to
anoint and rub their bodies with the grease of ani-
mals, with vilcous gums, and with oils of different
kinds. By this they check that profuls- perfpira-

are more improved, and whose residence is be.

is extremely mean and limple. They are wretched
huts, sometimes of an oblong and sometimes o0
a circular form, intended merely for shelter, with
no view to elegance, and little attention to con.
veniency. The doors are so low, that it is ne
ceffary to bend or to creep on the hands and fcei
in order to enter them. They are without win.
dows, and have a large hole in the middle of the
roof, to convey out the smoke. To follow tra.
vellers in other minute circumRfances of their de.
scription, is not only beneath the dignity of his.
tory, but would be foreign to the objec of my re.
searches. One circumstance merits attention, as
it is singular, and illustrates the chara&er of the
people. Some of their houses are so large as o
contain accommodation for fourscore or a hundred
persons. These are built for the reception of di:-
ferent families, which dwell together under the
fame roof , and often around a common fire,
without separate apartments, or any kind of screen
or partition between the spaces which they reljIc-
tively occupy. As soon as men have acquired

much attached to their femalcs, as to watch them
with care and jealousy; families of course divide
and lLttle in separate houses, where they can Ile

rhis singular mode of habitation among several -
people of America, may therefore be confidered not
)nly as the effect of their imperfee notions con-
:erning property, but as a proof of inattention
and indifference towards their women. If they
had not been accustomed to perseEt equality, such
Rn arrangement could not have taken place. If
their sensibility had been apt to have taken alarm,
lhey would not have trulted the virtue of tiicir
o0men amidst the temptations and opportunities
ps such a promiscuous intercourse. At tlhe lime
iime, the perpetual concord which reigns in habi-
tations where so many families are crowded toge-
:her, is surprising, and affords a Icriking evidence
hat they must be people of either a very gentle, or
ofa very phlegmatic temper, who, in such a fitua-
ion, are unacquainted with animosity, brawling,
lnd discord '.

while at a distance, and the bow and arrow is t!:

familiar to the inhabitants of every quarter of

tribes in America were so destitute of art and in.

covery of this simple invention °, and seem to have
been unacquainted with the use of any miflive wea

vcnrion s, as well as industry, were naturilly di-

every thing else, their wants and delircs were so
limited, that their invention was not upon the
stretch. As their food and habitations are per-
fetly simple, their domestic utensils are few and
rude. Some of the southern tribes had discovered
the art of forming vessels of earthen ware, and
baking them in the fun, so as they could endure
the fire. In North America, they hollowed a
piece of hard wood into the form of a kettle,
and filling it with water, brought it to boil by teiriof.n
putting red-hot stones into it t. These vcfils
they used in preparing part of their provisions;

refinement and luxury, for men in their rudest
frate were not acquainted with any method of

as neatness of their fabric, will appear the more B o o R
surprising.

BUT, in every attempt tcoards industry among uLinlemer

the Americans, one striking quality in their cha- theyarlcy
raCer is conspicuous. They apply to work with- tolabour.
out ardour, carry it on with little activity, and,
like children, are easily diverted from it. Even
in operations which seem the most interesting, and
where the rhoft powerful motives urge them to vi-
gorous exertions, they labour with a languid lift-
]effnefs. Their work advances under their hand
with such slowness, that an eye-witness c6mpares
it to the imperceptible progress of vegetation b.
They will spend so many years in forming a ca-
noe, that it often begins to rot with age before
they finish it. They will susser one part of a roof
to decay and perish, before they complete the
other c. The slightest manual operation consumes
a vast length of time, and what in pulifhed nations
would hardly be an effort of industry, is arfiong
avages an arduous undertaking. This slowness
of the Americans in executing works of every kind
may be imputed to various causes. Among fa-
vages, who do not depend for subsistence upon
the efforts of regular industry, time is of so little
importance, that they set no value upon it; and
provided they can finilh a design, they never re-
gard how long they are employed about it. The

feEtive, that every work in which they engage
must necessarily be tedious. The hand of the
most industrious and ikilful artist, were it furnilhed
with no better instrument than a stone hatchet, a
shell, or the bone of rome animal, would find it dif-
ficult to perfect the most simple work. It is by
length of labour, that he must endeavour to sup.
ply his clefect of power. But above all, the cold
phlegmatic temper peculiar to the Americans ren-
ders their operations languid. It is almost in-
poslible to rouze them from that habitual indo-
lence in which they are funk; and unless when
engaged in war or hunting, they siem incapableof
exerting any vigorous effort. Their ardour of ap-
plication is not so great as to call forth that in-
ventive spirit which suggests expedients for facili-
tating and abridging labour. They will return to
a talk day after day, but all their methods of exe-
cuting it are tedious and operose . Even finc:
the Europeans have communicated to them the
knowledge of their instruments, and taught them
to imitate their arts, the peculiar genius of the
Americans is conspicuous in every attempt they
make. They may be patient and assiduous in la-
bour, they can copy with a servile and minute ac-
curacy, but dilcover little invention, and no ta-
lents for dlilpatch. In spite of instruction and

THERE

THERE are two fundamental doEtrines, upon B o o K

Iv.
which the whole system of religion, as far as it can A---

nj~~~ i ir i Confined to

be discovered by the light of nature, is established. two articles.
The one refpets the being of a God, the other
the immortality of the foul. To discover the
ideas of the uncultivated nations under our review
with regard to thole important points, is not only
an objet of curiosity, but may afford inft'ruaion.
To there two articles I shall confine my researches,
leaving subordinate opinions, and the detail of
local superstitions, to more minute inquirers.
Whoever has had any opportunity of examining Thebeing.of
into the religious opinions of persons in the in.
ferior ranks of life, even in the most enlightened
and civilized nations, will find that their system
of belief is derived from infirucion, not disco-
vered by inquiry. That numerous part of the
human species, whose lot is labour, whose prin-
cipal and almost sole occupation is to secure sub-
fiftence, views the arrangement and operations of
nature with little reflection, and has neither leilure
nor capacity for entering into that path of refined
and intricate speculation which conduc's to the
knowledge of the principles of natural religion.
In the early and must rude periods of savage life,
such disquisitions are altogether unknown. When
the intellectual powers are just beginning to un-
fold, and their first feeble exertions are directed
towards a few objects of primary neceflity and ulc ;
when the faculties of the mind arc so limnited, as

diftlinguifl any thing that is not perceived by so!ne
of the senses; it is prepoflerous to expect that man
should be capable of tracing with accuracy the re.
lation between caulf and cfifet ; or to fuppole that
he should rife from the contemplation of the one
to the knowleclde of the other, and form just con.
ceptions of a Deity, as the Creator and Governor
of the univerle. Tiie idea of creation is so fan;i-
liar wherever the mind is enlarged by science, ;nd
illuminted with revelation, that we seldom reilecl
how profound and abltrule this idea is, or confirer
what progress man mnult have made in obfervaton
and rclearch, before he could arrive at any know-
ledge of this elementary principle in religion. Ac-
cordingil, Icveral tilbcs have been discovered in
Amrerica, which have no idea whatever of a Su-
preme BEing, and no rires of religious worflip.

only artong men in the mofl uncultivated slate of L.-
nature, and while their intelle&ual faculties are so
feeble and limited as hardly to elevate them above
the irrational creation, that we discover this total in-
lenfibility to the imprefions of any invisible power.

BUT the human mind, formed for religion, soon

opens to the reception of ideas, which are detined,
wben corrected and refined, to be the great source
of consolation amidst the calamities of life.
Among some of the American tribes, still in the
infancy of improvement, we dilcern apprehensions
of some invisible and powerful beings. 1 hefe ap-
prehensions are originally indistinct and perplexed,
and seem to be suggested rather by the dread of
imprnding evils, than to flow from gratitude for
blessings received. While Nature holds on her
course with uniform and undifRurbed regularity,
men enjoy the benefits rcfulting from it, without
inquiring concerning its cause. But every devia-

- unable to penetrate into these; but imagination, a

more forward and ardent faculty of the mind, de.
cides without hesitation. It ascribes the extraordi.
nary occurrences in nature to the influence of in.
visible beings, and supposes that the thunder, the
hurricane, and the earthqualk, are effects of their
interposition. Some such consuled notion of fpi.
ritual or invisible power, superintending over those
natural calamities which frequently desolate the
earth, and terrify its inhabitants, may be traced
among many rude nations k. But betides this, the
disasters and dangers of savage life are so many,
and men often find thenfclves in situations so
formidable, that the mind, ienfible of its own
weakness, has no resource but in the guidance and
protetion of wisdom and power superior to what
is human. Dcje&ed with calamities which opprcfs
him, and expolcd to dangers which he cannot re-
pel, the savage no longer relies upon himself; he
feels his own impotence, and fees no profpet of
being extricated, but by the interposition of some
unseen arm. Hence, in all unenlightened na-
tions, the sirs rites or practices which bear any re-
semblance to acts of religion, have it for their ob.
ject to avert evils which men lusTer or dread. The

The CemniJ of the ilanders were reputed by them to
be the authors of every calamity that afflifts the
human race; they were represented under the most
frightful forms, and religious homage was paid
to them with no other view than to appease these
furious deities m. Even among those tribes whole
religious system was more enlarged, and who had
formed some conception of benevolent beings, which
delighted in conferring benefits, as well as of ma-
licious powers prone to infliEt evil; superstition
still appears as the offspring of fear, and all its
efforts were employed to avert calamities. They
were persuaded that their good deities, prompted
by the beneficence of their nature, would bestow
every blessing in their power, without Iblicitation
or acknowledgment; and their only anxiety was
to soothe and deprecate the wrath of the powers
whom they regarded as the enemies of mankind n.

among them the word spirit has a meaning very B o O K
different from that in which we employ it, and --
that they have no conception of any deity but
what is corporeal. They believe their gods to
be of the human form, tdough of a nature more
excellent than man, and retail such wild incohe-
rent fables concerning their functions and opera-
tions, as are altogether unwo thy of a place in
history. Even among thcle tribes, there is no
established form of public wornfip; there are no
temples erected in honour of their deities; and
no ministers peculiarly consecrated to their service.
They have the knowledge, however, of several fu-
perftitious ceremonies and practices handed down
to them by tradition, and to there they have re-
course with a childish credulity, when rouzed by
any emergence from their usual insensibility, and
excited to acknowledge the power, and to implore
the protection of superior beings P.

THE tribe of the Natchez, and the people of svflemof

Bogota had advanced beyond the other unculti- thc Nachz.
vated nations of America in their ideas of religion,
as well as in their political inftiirtions; and it
is no less difficult to explain the cautl cf this
diftinetion than of that whicl we have alreadv
confidered. The Sun was the chief oj clt of re-

served a perpetual fire, as the puref errblem of
their divinity. Ministers were appointed to watch
and feed this sacred flame. The first ftnaion of
the great chief of the nation, every morning, was
an aft ofobeifance to the Sun; and festivals re.
turned at stated seasons, which were celebrated by
the whole community with solemn but unbloody
rites '. This is the most refined species of super.
flition known in America, and, perhaps, one of
the most natural as well as most reducing. The
Sun is the apparent source of the joys fertility,
and life, diffused through nature; and while the
human mind, in its early essays towards inquiry,
contemplates and admires his universal and ani.
mating energy, its admiration is apt to flop flhort
at what is visible, without reaching to the unseen
cause; and pays that adoration to the most glo.
rious and beneficial work of God, which is due
only to him who formed it. As fire is the purest
and most active of the elements, and in some of
its qualities and effccts resembles the Sun, it was,
not improperly, chosen to be the emblem of his
powerful operation. The ancient Persians, a
people far superior, in every refpecl, to that rude
tribe whose rites I am describing, founded their
religious system on similar principles, and efta-
blifled a form of public worship, less gross and

cidence in sentiment between two nations, in fi¢ch
different states of improvement, is one of the
many singular and unaccountable circumstances
which occur in the hittory of human affairs.

AMONG the people of Bogota, the Sun and
Moon were, likewise, the chief objecis of venera-
tion. Their system of religion was more regular
and complete, though lels pure, than that of the
Natchez. They had temples, altars, pricfts, fa-
crifices, and that long train of ceremonies, which
superstition introduces wherever she has fully eita-
blifhed her dominion over the minds of men. But
the rites of their worship were cruel and bloody.
They offered human victims to their deities, and
many of their practices nearly resembled the bar-

tural. Upon this, are founded the most exalted
hopes of man in his highert itate of improvement;
nor has nature withheld from him this foothino
consolation, in the most early and rude period of
his progress. We can trace this opinion from one
extremity of America to the other. In some re-
gions more faint and obscure, in others more per.
fetly developed, but no where unknown. The
most uncivilized of its savage tribes do not appre-
hend death as the extinction of being. All enter-
tain hopes of a future and more happy state, wlire
they flall be for ever exempt from the calamities
which embitter human life in its present condition.
This future state they conceive to be a delightful
country, blessed with perpetual spring, whole i.

fish, where famine is never felt, and uninterrupted
plenty shall be enjoyed without labour or toil.
But as men, in forrming their firit imperfect ideas

cherifhled by a different principle, and derives
strength from another alliance. As the diseases of
men, in the savage state, are (as has been already ob-
served) like those of the animal creation, few but
extremely violent, their impatience under what they
susser, and solicitude for the recovery of health, soon
inspired them with extraordinary reverence for such
as pretended to understand the nature of their maja-
dies, or to preserve them from their sudden and fa-
tal effects. These ignorant pretenders, however,
were such utter firangers to the ftrutiure of the hu-
man frame, as to be equally unacquainted with the
causes of its disorders, and the manner in which
they will terminate. Superltition, mingled fre-
quently with fbme portion of craft, supplied what
they wanted in icience. They imputed the origin
of diseases to supernatural influence, and prcferibed
or performed a variety of mylterious rites, which
they gave out to be of power ilfficicnt to remnove

WHENEVER men acknowlcJge the reality of fu- Critialy
pernatural power and discernment in one infcance,
they have a propensity to admit it in others. Tlhe
Americans did not long fuppolf tle efficacy of
conjuration to be confined to one subje&c. They
had rccourli to it in every situation of danger or
diftrels. When the events of war were peculiarly
difaitrous, when they met with unforefcen difap-
pointments in hunting, vwhen inundations or
drought threatened their crops with deftrucion,
ihey called upon their conjurers to begin their in-
cantations, in order to discover the caules of those
calamities, or to foretell what would be their
ifflueb. Their confidence in this delusive art gra-
(cually increaedl, and inanifefied itself in all the oc-
currencesof life.. When.involved in any difficulty,
or about to enter upon any tranfaEtion of moment,
every individual regularly consulted the forcerer,
and depended upon his inflrutctions to extricate

their manners.

AMONG savages, in every part of the globe, the Love of
love of dancing is a favourite passion. As, during
a great part of their time, they languish in a Itate
of inactivity and indolence, without any oc-
cupation to rouse or interest them, they delight
universally in a pastime which calls forth the aFtive
powers of their nature into exercise. The Spa-
niards, when they first visited America, were afto-
nifled at the fondness of the natives for dancing, and
beheld with wonder a people, cold and unanimated
in most of their other pursuits, kindle into life, and
exert themselves with ardour, as often as this fa-
yourite amusement recurred. Among them, in-
deed, dancing ought not to be denominated an
amusement. It is a serious and important occupa-
tion, which mingles in every occurrence of public
or private life. If any intercourse be necessary be-
tween two American tribes, the ambassadors of
the one approach in a solemn dance, and present
the calumet or emblem of peace; the sachems
of the other receive it with the fame ceremony d,

person is indisposed, a dance is prescribed as the

ALL their dances are imitations of iore action;

a mimic fccne, or view it without emotions of fear

BUT however expressive some of the American
dances may be, there is one circumflance in them
remarkable, and connected with the character of
the race. The sungs, the dances, the amuilnfcents
of other nations, exprefive of the fentimnents which
animate their hearts, are often adapted to display
or excite that sensibility which mutually attaches
the lexes. Among some people, tloch is the ardour
of this paflon, that love is altmofl the sole object
of fcftivity and joy; and as rude nations are
firangers to delicacy, and unaccullomned to iif-
guise any emotion of their minds, their dances are
often extremely wanton and indecent. Such is the
Calenda, of which the natives of Africa are so pas-
fionately fond '; and such the feats of the dancing
girls, which the Asiatics contemplate with so
much avidity of desire. But, amnong the Ameri-

such gaming parties frequently recur, and become
their most acceptable entertainment at every great
festival. Supertfition, which is apt to take hold of
those passions which are most vigorous, frequently
lends its aid to confirm and strengthen this fa-
vourite inclination. Their conjurers are accuf-
tomed to prescribe a folernn match at play, as one
of the most efficacious methods of appearing their
gods, or of restoring the tick to health k.

of the first exertions of human ingenuity to discover
some composition of an intoxicating quality; and
there is hardly any nation so rude, or so defditute

mentation, can accomplish the fame end by other
means. The people of the islands, of NortlW
America, and of California, used, for this pur.
pole, the smoke of tobacco, drawn up with a cer-
tain instrument into the nofirils, the fumes of
which alcending to the brain, they felt all the
rranfports and Irenzy of intoxication m. In almost
every othe'r part of the New World, the natives
poifefled the art of extracting an intoxicating
liquor from maize or the manioc root, the fame
substances which they convert into bread. The
operation by which they cff cEt this, nearly re-
iembles th. common one of brewing, but with
this difference, that in place of yeft, they ife a
nauseous infusion of a certain quantity of maize or
manioc chewed by their women. The saliva ex-
cites a vigorous fermentation, and in a' few clays
the liquor becomes fit for drinking. It is nco
disagreeable to the taste, and when swallowed in
large quantities, is of an intoxicating quality!
This is the general beverage of the Americans,
which they diftinguifl by various names, and for
which they feel such a violent and insatiable lc-
fire, as it is not easy either to conceive or clcIribe.

continual occupation, the desire for strong drink n o o K
is regulated, in a great measure, by the climate, _
and increases or diminishes according to the va-
riations of its temperature. In warm regions, the
delicate and sensible frame of the inhabitants does
not require the stimulation of fermented liquors.
In colder countries, the constitution of the natives,.
more robust and more sluggish, stands in need of
generQus liquors to quicken and animate it. But
among savages, the desire of ibmnthing that is of
power to intoxicate, is in every ficuation the fame.
All the people of America, if we except some
I'nall tribes near the Straits of Magellan, whether
na:ives of the torrid zone, or inhabitants of its
more temperate regions, or placed by a harder
fate in the severe climates towards its northern or
southern extremity, appear to be equally under
the dominion of this appetite o. Such a similarity
of tafe, among people in such different situations,
mulf be ascribed to the influence of ofme moral
caule, and cannot be conrfidered as the efscr-t of
any physical or constitutional want. While en-
gaged in war or in the chafe, thle savage is ofte-n
in the mofi interefling situations, and all the
powers of his nature are rouzed to the most vigor-
ous exertions. LBUt 'lose animating scenes are tuc-

B o o K the warrior meets with nothing that he deems of

sufficient dignity or importance to merit his atten.
tion. He languilhes and mopes in this season of
indolence. The posture of his body is an emblem
of the itate of his mind. In one climate, cower-
ing over the fire in his cabin; in another,
stretched under the Ihade of some tree, he doses
away his time in sleep, or in an unthinking joyless
inactivity, not far removed from it. As itrong
liquors awake him from this torpid state, give
a brisker motion to his spirits, and enliven him
more thoroughly than either dancing or gaming,
his love of them is excessive. A savage, when
not engaged in action, is a pensive melancholy ani-
mal ; but as loon as he taftes, or has a profpet of
taiting, the intoxicating draught, he becomes gay
and frolickfome P. Whatever be the occasion or
pretext on which the Americans assemble, the
meeting always terminates in a debauch. Many of
their festivals have no other objec, and they wel-
come the return of them with transports of joy.
As they are nor accustomed to restrain any appe-
tite, they set no bounds to this. The riot often
continues without intermission several days; and
whatever may be the fatal effeEts of their excess,
they never cease from drinking as long as one drop
of liquor remains. The persons of greated emi-
nence, the inofl diftinguifled warriors, and the
chiefs moit renowned for their wisdom, have no

greater command of themselves than the most ob- B o o x
fcure member of the community. Their eagerness i.- _
for present enjoyment renders them blind to its
fatal consequences; and those very men, who, in
other situations, seem to possess a force of mind
more than human, are in this instance inferior to
children in foresight, as well as consideration, and
mere slaves of brutal appetite q. When their pas-
sions, naturally strong, are heightened and in-
flamed by drink, they are guilty of the most enor-
mous outrages, and the festivity seldom concludes
without deeds of violence, or bloodshed r.

BUT, amidst this wild debauch, there is one
circumstance remarkable; the women, in molt of
the American tribes, are not permitted to partake
of it '. Their province is to prepare the liquor, to
serve it about to the guests, and to take care of
their husbands and friends, whetl their reason is
overpowered. This exclusion of the women from
an enjoyment so highly valued by savages, may be
jufly confidered as a mark of their inferiority, and
as an additional evidence of that contempt with
which they were treated in the New World. The
people of North America, ,vhen firfl discovered,
were not acquainted with any intoxicating drink;
but as the Europeans early found it their interest
to supply them with spirituous liquors, drunken-

their parents and other relations become old, or
labour under any distemper which their slender
knowledge of the healing art cannot remove, t!e
Americans cut short their days with a violent hand,
in order to be relieved from the burden of Iulp.

vailed among the ruder tribes in every p.:r:
of the continent, from Hudson's Bay to the
river De la Piata; and however ihocking ;i
may be to those sentiments of tenderness and a:-
tachment, which, in civilized life, we are apt to
confider as congenial with our frame, the con-
(lition of man in the savage state leads and rec(n-
ciles him to it; The fame hardships and diflicul;,y

the latter to perform the functions that belong to a B o 0 K
warrior or hunter, or to endure those various
diftrefes in which savages are so often involved,
by their own want of foresight and industry.
Their relations feel this, and, incapable of attend-
ina ro the wants or weaknesses of others, tr'eir
impatience under an additional burden pronmts
them to extinguiii that life which they find it
diiculc.to fultain. This is not :" . . eed
of cruelty, but as an act of meicy. An Ameri-
can, broken with years and infirmities, ccrfcious
that he can no longer depend on the aid of thole
around him, places himself contentedly in hi;
grave; and it is by the hands of his children or
nearest relations that the thong is pulled, or the
blow inflited, which releases him for ever from
the sorrows of life .

IX. AFTER contemplating the rude Am:'rican Cc,-rlefni-
tribes in such various lights, after taking a v:-w cl'',C,
of their customs and manners from ol main dif-
ferent flations, nothing remains but to form a re-
neral eflimate of their charaSter, compared with
tlat of more polilhed nations. A human being,
as he comes originally from the hand of nature, is
evcry where the fame. At his first appearance in
the Itate of infancy, whether it be among the rudcll:
savages, or in the molt civilized nation, we can

to be the fame; and the talents he may afterwards
acquire, as well as the virtues he may be rendered
capable ofexercifing, depend, in a great meauire,
upon the fRate of society in which he is placed.
To this state his mind naturally accommodates it-
self, and from it receives discipline and culture.
In proportion to the wants which it accustoms a
human being to feel, and the functions in wiich
t!icleengage him, his intellectualpowers are c.elled
forth. According to the connections which it
delabliihes between him and the reft of his lpF;
cics, the affections of his heart are exerted. It ;
only by attending to this great principle, that v.
can dilcover what is the character of man in every

attainments of the human mind in that state by
this standard, we flall find, according to an cb-
servation which I have already made, that the in.
tellectual powers of man mtft be extremely limited
in their operations. They are confined within the
narrow sphere of what he deems necessary for lup
plying his own wants. Whatever has not Ibme rc-

cupations of war or of hunting, he often finds him-

sequence of this, hce f:els the knowlelge which he

As the talents of indiviJuals arc exerciled an' ;',,,;tic ta-

improved by such exertions, much politic;.l wij-
dol, is said to be difpayed in conduding t;.e as-
fairs of their small communities. The council or

its interests, and determining with rci[eet to i:acc
or war, has been conmparecl to the flnate in more
polished republics. 'lhei proceedings of ti;c fbr-

B 0 0 K such confidence with their countrymen, as to have

CPI-__ an ascendant in those assemblies x. But, among

savage tribes, the field for displaying political ta-
lents cannot be extensive. Where the idea of pri.
vate property is incomplete, and no criminal ju-
rifdiaion is established, there is hardly any iunic
tion of internal government to exercise. Where
there is no commerce, and scarcely any intercour!e
among separate tribes; where enmity is impla-
cable, and hostilities are carried on almost without
intermission; there will be few points of public
concern to adjust with their neighbours; and that
department of their affairs which may be denormi.
nated foreign, cannot be so intricate as to require
any refined policy in conducting it. Where in-
dividuals are so thoughtless and improvident as
seldom to take effecual precautions for lelf-pre-
servation, it is vain to expect that public m-a-
fures and deliberations will be regulated by the
contemplation of remote events. It is the genius
of savages to act from the impulse of present pas-
sion. They have neither foresight nor temper to
sorn complicated arrangements with reflpceL to
their future conduct. The conlfltations of the
Americans, indeed, are so frequent, and thir
negociations are so many Y, and so long protrac'[d,
as to give their proceedings an extraordinary alpetco
of wil-dom. But this is not owing so much to lhe
depth of their cliemnes, as to the coldness and

phlegm of their temper, which renders them flow B o o K
in determining z. If we except the celebrated c-vr
league, that united the Five Nations in Canada
into a federal republic, which shall be confidered
in its proper place, we can discern few such
traces of political wisdom, among the rude Ame-
rican tribes, as discover any great degree of fore-
fight or extent of intellectual abilities. Even
among them, we (hall find public measures more
frequently directed by the impetuous ferocity of
their youth, than regulated by the experience and
wisdom of their old men.

As the condition of man in the savage slate Degreeof
is unfavourable to the progress of the understand-
ing, it has a tendency likewise, in some refpeOts,
to check the exercise of affetion, and to render
the heart contracted. Thie ftrongeit feeling in the
mind of a savage is a fenie of his own independ-
ence. He has sacrificed so linall a portion of his
natural liberty by becoming a member of society,
that he remains, in a great degree, the sole maftcr
of his own actions ". I-Ie often takes his refo-
lutionS alone, without consulting, or feeling any
connection with the persons around him. In many
of his operations, he (lands as much detached
from the reft of his Ifecies, as if he had formed
no union with them. Conscious how little he de-
penrs upon other men, he is apt to view them

as he looks not beyond himself in deliberating
with respect to the part which he {hould aft, his
solicitude about the consequences of it seldom ex-
tends farther. He pursues his own career, and
indulges his own fancy, without inquiring or re-
garding whether what he does be agreeable or of.
fenfive to others, whether they may derive bene-
fit, or receive hurt from it. Hence the ungovern.
able caprice of savages, their impatience undzr
any species of restraint, their inability to fupprci;
or moderate any inclination, the scorn or neglect
with which they receive advice, their high etlima-
tion of tlhemfelves, and their contempt of otiir
men. Among them, the pride of independence
produces almost the fame effects with interelled-

receives it with much fatisfa0tion, because it con-
tributes to his enjoyment; but this sentiment ex-

obligation, he neither feels gratitude, nor thinks
of making any return c. Even among persons the
nioft ciofely conneced, the exchange of those good
offices which strengthen attachment, mollify the
heart, and sweeten the intercourse of life, is not fre-
quent. The high ideas of independence among the
Americans nourith a fullen reserve, which keeps
them at a distance from each other. The nearest

Americans have become acquainted with the do-
meitic animals of Europe, and avail themfdlves

that they always treat them harfily k, and never

naging them, but force and cruelty. In every
part of the deportment of man in his savage state,
whether towards his equals of the human species,
or towards the animals below him, we recognize
the fame character, and trace the operations of a
n-ind intent on its own gratifications, and regu-

remarkable for low artifice in carrying on their (-v
little projects. Among savages, whole views are
equally confined, and their attention no leds perle-
vering, those circumstances must operate flill more
powerfully, and gradually accufton them to a dil-
ingenuous subtlety in all their tranfiajions. The
force of this is increased by habits which they ac-
quire in carrying on the two moil interelfing ope-
rations wherein they are engaged. With then-
war is a Cyflem of craft, in which thliy trust forl
success to stratagem more than to open lorce, and
have their invention continually on the ftreti'h to
circumvent and surprise their enemies. As hut-
ers, it is their constant object to enlhare, in order
that they may destroy. Accordingly, art and cun-
ning have been universally obierved as ditiinguiih-
ing charaCteristics of all savages. The ipop)le of
the rude tribes of America are remarkable for their
artifice and duplicity. Impenetrably secret in form-
ing their mealures, they pursue them with a patient
undeviating attention, and there is no refinement of
dissimulation which they cannot employ, in order to
inliure fucccfs. The natives of Peru were engaged
above thirty years, in concerting the plan of that
iniurrecrtion which took place under the vice-royalty
of the marquis de Villa-Garcia ; and though it was
communicated to a great number of pcrfons in all

the spirit of independence, which is the pride of a
savage, and which he confiders as the unalicnable

disdaining to acknowledge any superior, his mind,

of its pursuits, acquires such elevation by the con.

enmities, as I have observed, are implacable and B o o K
immrortal. The valour of the young men is never ,..
allowed to rust in inaction. The hatchet is always
in their hand, either for attack or defence. Even
in their hunting excursions, they must be on their
guard against Iurprife from the hostile tribes, by
which they are surrounded. Accutiomed to con-
tinual alarms, they grow familiar with d;:nger

be formed upon different principles, but in n. situ-

members. From the nature of their political
union, one might expect this tie to be extremely
feeble. But there are ciicuniftances which render
the influence, even of their loolb mode of alibcia-

Imall; combilned againfl thei.i neighbours, in pro-

man extend not beyond that state of fociecy to
which he is habituated. What it presents a'; ob-

their own purluits, and satisfied with t-heir own b _--
lot, are equally, unable to comprehend the inten-
tion or utility of the various accommodations,
which, in more polilhed lociety, are deemed efTcn-
tial to the comfort of life. Far from complaining
of their own situation, or viewing that of men in
a more improved state with admiration or envy,
they regard themselves as the standard of excel-
lence, as beings the best entitled, as well as the
moll perfectly qualifedl, to enjoy real happincls.
Unaccustomed to any rcftraint upon their will or
their actions, they behold with amazement the in-
equality of rank, and the subordination which
take place in civilized life, and confider the volun-
tary fubmiflion of one man to another, as a renun-
ci.ltion, no less bale than unaccountable, of the
firit diftini ion of humanity. Void of forcfight, as
well as free from care themselves, and delighted
with that state of indolent security, they wonder at
the anxious precautions, the unceasing industry,
and complicated arrangements of lEuropeans, in
guarding against diitant evils, or providing for fu-
ture wants; and they often exclaim against their
prepotferous folly, in thus multiplying the troubles,
and increasing the labour of life ". 'his preference

The fame principle regulated the notions of the

they soon came to abate their ef'imation of men,
whose maxims of life were so different from thrir

B o o K the mistakes into which such as examine them may

cv__s fall. In contemplating the inhabitants of a coun.

try so widely extended as America, great attention
should be paid to the diversity of climates under
which they are placed. The influence of this I
have pointed out with refpe& to several important
particulars, which have been the obje& of re.
search; but even where it has not been men.
tioned, it ought not to be overlooked. The pro.
vinces of America are of such different tempera-
ment, that this alone is sufficient to constitute a
distinction between their inhabitants. In every
part of the earth where man exists, the power of
cliaate operates, with decisive influence, upon his
condition and character. In those countries which
approach near to the extremes of heat or cold, thii
influence is so conspicuous as to strike every eye.
Whether we confider man merely as an animal,
or as being endowed with rational powers which
fit him for activity and ipeculation, we shall find
that he has uniformly attained the greatest perfec-
tion of which his nature is capable, in the tempe-
rate regions oi thec globe. There his conititution
is most vigorous, his organs most acute, and his
form nmoft beautiful. There, too, he pofflffrsa
superior extent of capacity, greater fertility od
imagination, more enterprising courage, anl a
sensibility of heart which gives birth to pafionS,
not only ardent, but pcrlcvcring. In this favourite
situation he has displaycd the utmost efforts of his
genius, in literature, in policy, in commtrCce, n

var,

war, and in all the arts which improve or embel- B o o i
lilh life ". I.v

THIS powerful operation of climate is felt most
sensibly by rude nations, and produces greater es-
fe&s than in societies more improved. The ta-
lents of civilized men are continually exerted in ren-
dering their own condition more comfortable; and
by their ingenuity and inventions, they can, in a
great measure, supply the defects, and guard
against the inconveniences of any climate. But the
improvident savage is affec2ed by every circum-
fiance peculiar to his situation. He takes no pre-
caution either to mitigate or to improve it. Like
plant, or an animal, he is formed by the climate
under which he is placed, and feels the full force
of its influence.

IN surveying the rude nations of America, this
atural diftindion between the inhabitants of the
temperate and torrid zones is very remarkable. They
ay, accordingly, be divided into two great classes.
he one comprehends all the North Americans,
rom the river St. Laurence to the Gulf of Mexico,
ogether with the people of Chili, and a few finall
ribes towards the extremity of the southern conti-
ent. To the other belong all the inhabitants of
he ifands, and those fettled in the various provinces
lhich extend from the isthmus of Darien almost to

They poIT!s, in the most eminent degree, that
force of mind, and love of independence, which I

larger territories than he was able to occupy, or - -
because they had been saved from opprefilon by
their remote and inaccellible situation.

CoNsPIrcuous as this diftinssion may appear be-
tween the inhabitants of thbfe different regions,
it is not, however, universal. Moral and polincal
caufs, as I have formerly observed, asset the
disposition and character of individuals a, well as
nations, still more powerfully than the influence
of climate. There are, accordingiv, fime trioes,
in various parts of the torrid zone, -offelfIt( of
courage, high spirit, and the love of independence,
in a degree hardly inferior to the natives of more
temperate climates. We are too little acquainted
with the history of those people, to be able to
trace the several circ:lmfrances in their progrels
and situation, to which they are indebted for this
remarkable pre-eminence. The fait, neverthe-
less, is certain. As early as the first voyage
of Columbus, he received information that ice-
ral of the islands were inhabited by the Caribbecs,
a fierce race of men, nowise re mbling their
feeble and timid neighbours. In his Iecond ex-
pedition to the New World, he fbund this in-
tormation to be just, and was hinifelf a witness of
their intrepid valour '. The fame character they
have maintained invariably in all subsequent con-

1_-V._ own times, we have seen them make a gallant itand

in defence of the last territory which the rapacity of
their invaders had left in their possession z. Some
nations in Brasil were no less eminent for vigour of
mind, and bravery in war . The people of the
ifhmus of Darien boldly met the Spaniards in the
field, and frequently repelled those formidable in.
vaders b. Other instances might be produced. It
is not by attending to any single cause or principle,
how powerful and extensive soever its influence may
appear, that we can explain the actions, or account
for the character, of men. Even the law of climate,
more universal, perhaps, in its operation than any
that affects the human species, cannot be applied,
in judging of their conduct, without many excep.
tions.

ambition, and not destitute of talents for govern.
ment, he possessed neither such courage, nor such
vigour and ativity of mind, as to undertake in
person the conuiuc of the armament which he was
pr.pairing. In this embarrassing situation, he
fornmed ti;e chimerical scheme, not only of atchiev.
ing great exploits by a deputy, but of sec .;ing to
himlelf the glory of conquests which were to be
made by another. In the execution of this plan,
he fondly aimed at reconciling contradicdions. He
was solicitous to chufe a commander of intrepid
refoluti.n, and of superior abilities, becaule he
knew thefr to be requisite in order to.enfure fuc-
cess ; but, at the fame time, from the jealousy
natural to little minds, he wished this person to be
of a fpirir tb tame and obsequious, as to be en-
tirely dependant on his will. But when he came
to apply those ideas in forming an opinion con-
cerning the several officers who occurred to his
thoughts as worthy of being cntrufted with the
coniland, he soon perceived that it was imp(llible
to find such incompatible qualities united in one
charanter. Such as were ditfinguifhed for courage
and talents were too high-fpirited to be paffivc in-
Iruments in his hand. Thofewhoo appeared more
gentle and tradable, were destitute of capacity,
anld u ii.'il to the charge. This augmented his
perplexity and his fears. -Ie deliberated long,

in his choice, when Amador de Lares, the royal L -
treasurer in Cuba, and Andres Duero, his own '5 8'
secretary, the two persons in whom he chiefly con-
fided, were encouraged by this irresolution to pro-
pote a new candidate, and they supported their
recommendation with such assiduity and address,
that, no less fatally for Velasquez than happily for
their country, it proved successful b.
THE man whom they pointed out to him was He appoints

Fernando Cortes. He was born at Medellin, a mandc'r.
small town in Eitremadura, in the year one thou-
sand four hundred and eiglty-five, and descended
from a family of noble blood, but of very mode-
rate fortune. Being originally dftined by his
parents to the study of law, as the most likely
method of bettering his condition, he was sent
early to the university of Salamanca, where he
imbibed omre tincture of learning. But he was
soon disgusted with an academic life, which did
not suit his ardent and restless genius, and retired
to Medellin, where he gave himself up entirely to
active sports and martial exercises. At this pe-
riod of life, he was so impetuous, so overbearing,
and so dissipated, that his father was glad to com-
ply with his inclination, and fend him abroad as
an adventurer in arms. There were in that age
two conspicuous theatres, on which such of the

isl'8 mand of the Great Captain; the other in the New

World. Cortes preferred the former, but was
prevented by indisposition from embarking with a
reinforcement of troops sent to Naples. Upon
this disappointment he turned his views towards
America, whither he was allured by the pro.
fpeft of the advantages which he might derive
from the patronage of Ovando c, the governor of
Hispaniola, who was his kinsman. When he
landed at St. Domingo in one thousand five hun.
dred and four, his reception was such as equalled
his most sanguine hopes, and he was employed
by the governor in several honourable and lucra.
tive stations. These, however, did not satisfy his
ambition; and in the year one thousand five hun.
dred and eleven, he obtained permiflion to aco
company Diego Velasquez in his expedition to
Cuba. In this service he diffinguilhed himself so
much, that, notwithstanding tome violent contelis
with Velasquez, occasioned by trivial events, un-
worthy of rcmemnbrance, he was at length taken into
favour, and received an ample conceflion of lands
and of Indians, the recompence usually bellowed
upon adventurers in the New World d.

veral scenes of difficulty and danger, as raised uni- B oO x
versal expectation, and turned the eyes of his -
countrymen towards him, as one capable of per-
forming great things. The turbulence of youth,
as soon as he found objects and occupations
suited to the ardour of his mind, gradually sub-
fided, and fettled into a habit of regular indefa-
tigable activity. The impetuosity of his temper,
when he came to act with his equals, insensibly
abated, by being kept under restraint, and mel-
lowed into a cordial soldierly frankness. These
qualities were accompanied with calm prudence in
concerting his schemes, with persevering vigour in
executing them, and with what is peculiar to fu-
perior genius, the art of gaining the confidence
and governing the minds of men. To all which
were added the inferior accomplishments that strike
the vulgar, and command their refpeat; a grace-
ful person, a winning afpeft, extraordinary ad-
dress in martial exercises, and a constitution of
such vigour as to be capable of enduring any fa-
tigue.

As soon as Cortes was mentioned to Velasquez

by his two confidents, he flattered himself that he
had at length found what he had hitherto fought
in vain, a man with talents for command, but
not an object of jealousy. Neither the r;nkl nor
the fortune of Cortes, as he imagined, were such
that he could aspire at independence. He had
reason to believe, that by his own rcadinels to

\ hoped, by this new andi unexpected mark of con.

fidence, that he might attach him for ever to his
interest.

Soon be. CORTES, receiving his commifflon with the
CO sles jea-
loes of him, warmest expressions of refpec and gratitude to the
aober .3 governor, immediately erected his standard before

his own houle, appeared in a military dress, and
assumed all the ensigns of his new dignity. His
utmofl influence and activity were exerted in per-
fuading many of his friends to engage in the ser-
vice, and in urging forward the preparations for
the voyage. All his own funds, together with
what money he could raise by mortgaging his
lands and Indians, were expended in purchasing
military stores and provisions, or in supplying the
wants of such of his officers as were unable to
equip themselves in a manner suited to their
rank c. Inoffensive, and even laudable as this con-
duct was, his disappointed competitors were mali-
cious enough to give it a turn to his disadvantage.
They represented him as aiming already, with
little dirguife, at establishing an independent au-
thority over his troops, and endeavouring to secure
their refpeEt or love by his ostentatious and in-
terested liberality. They reminded Velasquez of

his

his former difflnfions with the man in whom he B o o
now reposed bs much confidence, and foretold that -
Cortes would be more apt to avail himself of the
power, which the governor was inconsiderately
putting in his hands, to avenge past injuries,
than to requite recent obligations. These infinua-
tions made such impression upon the suspicious
mind of Velalquez, that Cortes toon obierved some
symptoms of a growing alienation and distrust in
his behaviour, and was advised by Lares and
Duero, to haftcn his departure, before these flould
become so confirmed, as to break out with open
violence. Fully lenfible of this danger, he urged
forward his preparations with iich rapidity, that
he set fail from St. Jago de Cuba on the eighteenth
of November, Velasquez accompanying him to
the shore, and taking leave of him with an ap-
pearance of perfect friendship and confidence,
though he had fecrerly given it in charge to some
of Cortes's officers, to keep a watchful eye upon
every part of their commander's conduA f.

CORTES proceeded to Trinidad, a frall fettle- Endeavours

lent,

B o o K lent, that it was impossible to suppress it. The

V.
y-^ armament was no longer under his own eye and
s5'8. direction; and he felt, that as his power over it

ceased, that of Cortes would become more absolute.
Imagination now aggravated every circumstance,
which had formerly excited suspicion: the rivals
of Cortes industriously threw in refletions which
increased his fears; and with no less art than ma-
lice they called superstition to their aid, employing
the prediEtions of an astrologer in order to com-
plete the alarm. All these, by their united opera.
tion, produced the desired effect. Velasquez re-
pented bitterly of his own imprudence, in having
committed a trust of so much importance to a per-
son whose fidelity appeared so doubtful, and hastily
dispatched instructions to Trinidad, empowering
Verdugo, the chief magistrate there, to deprive
Cortes of his commission. But Cortes had already
made such progress in gaining the esteem and con-
fidence of his troops, that, finding officers as well
as soldiers equally zealous to support his authority,
lie soothed or intimidated Verdugo, and was per-
mitted to depart from Trinidad without molefta-
tion.

and to lny FiROM Trinidad Cortes failed for the Havana,
him under
arrest. in order to raise more soldiers, and to complete

the viltualling of his fleet. There several persons
of dillinEtion entered into the service, and engaged
to futpply what provisions were still wanting; but
as it was nccefary to allow tnem some- time for

performilg

performing what they had promised, Velasquez, B o oK
sensible that he ought no longer to rely on a man
of whom he had so openly discovered his difruft, '518
availed himself of the interval, which this un-
avoidable delay afforded, in order to make one
attempt more to wrest the command out of the
hands of Cortes. He loudly complained of Ver-
dugo's condu&t, accusing him either of childish
facility, or of manifest treachery, in suffering
Cortes to escape from Trinidad. Anxious to guard
against a second disappointment, he sent a person
of confidence to the Havana, with peremptory in-
junctions to Pedro Barba, his lieutenant-governor
in that colony, initantly to arrest Cortes, to fend
him prisoner to St. Jago under a itrong guard, and
to countermand the failing of the armament until
he hould receive farther orders. He wrote like-
wife to the principal officers, requiring them to
afift Barba in executing what he had given him
in charge. But before the arrival of his messen-
ger, a Franciscan friar of St. Jago had secretly
conveyed an account of this inrcrefting tranfac-
tion to Bartholomew de Olmedo, a monk of the
fame order, who aced as chaplain to the expedi-
tion.
CORTES, forewarned of the danger, had time Cortes de-

, . - °/ats his
to take precautions for his own safety. His rcihmer, and

firt ftep was to find some pretext for removing llr,,tra-

but though this expedition was fitted out by the
united effort of the Spanish power in Cuba;
though every settlement had contributed its quota
of men and provisions ; though the governor had
laid out considerable funs, and each adventurer
had exhausted his frock, or strained his credit, the
poverty of the preparations was luch as must afto-
nifh the present age, and bore, indeed, no refem-
blance to an armament deftinedl for'the conquest
of a great empire. The fleet consisted of eleven
vefels ; the largest of a hundred tons, which was
dignified with the name of Admiral , three of fe-
venty or eighty tons, and the reft small open
barks. On board of these were fix hundred and
seventeen men; of which five hundred and eight
belonged to the land service, and a hundred and
nine were seamen or artificers. The soldiers were
divided into eleven companies, according to the
number of the ships; to each of which Cortes ap-
pointed a captain, and committed to him the com-
mand of the veffl while at sea, and of the men
when on shore g. As the use of fire-arms among
the nations of Europe was hitherto confined to a

prompting the Spaniards to all their enterprifs, a
large cross was displayed in their fiandards, with
this inscription, Let us follow the crcfs, for wider
this sign we Jhall conquer.

So powerfully were Cortes and his followers

animated with both there passions, that no less
eager to plunder the opulent country whither they
were bound, than zealous to propagate the Chrit-
ian faith among its inhabitants, they set out, not
with the solicitude natural to men going upon dan-
gerous services, but with that confidence which
arises from security of success, and certainty of tlh
divine protection.

had the good fortune to redeem Jerome de Agui-
lar, a Spaniard, who had been eight years a pri-
soner among the Indians. This man was perfectly
acquainted with a dialect of their language, under-
stood through a large extent of country, and pof-
feling betides a considerable share of prudence
and sagacity, proved extremely useful as an inter-
preter. From Cozumel, Cortes proceeded to the March4.

friendly as Grijalva had met with there, and us
finding gold in the fame abundance but the dif-
position of the natives, from some unknown cause,
was totally changed. After repeated endeavours
to conciliate their good-will, he was constrained to
have recourse to violence. Though the forces of
the enemy were numerous, and advanced with ex-
traordinary courage, they were routed, with great
slaughter, in several successive acions. The lots
which they sustained, and fiill mure the aftonifnl
ment and terror excited by the leftructive effet&
of the fire-arms, and the dreadful appearance of
the horses, humbled their fierce spirits, and in-
duced them to sue for peace. They acknow-
ledged the king of Castile as their fovclcign, and
granted Cores a supply of provisions, with a pre-
lent of cotton garments, some gold, and twenty
female salves'.

B o0 K CORTES continued his course to the weflward,
q...-.-. keeping as near the Ihore as possible, in order to
Arrives at observe the country; but could discover no pro.

. ua de per place for landing, until he arrived at St. Juan
April 2. de Ulua k. As he entered this harbour, a large

canoe, 'full of people, among whom were two
who seemed to be persons of diftinftion, approach.
ed his ship, with signs of peace and amity. They
came on board without fear or diffruft, and ad-
dressed him in a most refpeAful manner, but in a
language altogether unknown to Aguilar. Cortes
was in the utmost perplexity and distress, at an
event of which he instantly foresaw all the confe-
quences, and already felt the hesitation and uncer.
tainty with which he should carry on the great
schemes which he meditated, if, in his tranf.
acions with the natives, he muff depend entirely
upon such an imperfect, ambiguous, and conjec,
tural mode of communication, as the use of signs,
But he did not remain long in this embarralling
situation: a fortunate accident extricated him,
when his own sagacity could have contributed
little towards his relief. One of the female slaves,
whom he had received from the cazique of Ta.
barco, happened to be present at the first inter-
view between Cortes and his new guests. She per.
ceived his distress, as well as the confusion of
Aguilar; and as flhe perfetly understood the
Mexican language, flhe explained what they l;::tl

said in the Yucatan tongue, with which Aguilar was B o o K
acquainted. This woman, known afterwards by ;-
the name of Donna Marina, and who makes a con- ,5'9
fpicuous.figure in the history of the New World,
where. great revolutions were brought about by
small causes and inconsiderable instruments, was
born in one of the provinces of the Mexican em-
pire. Having been fold as a slave in the early part
of her life, after a variety of adventures fihe fell
into the hands of the Tabafcans, and had resided
long enough among them to acquire their ian-
guage, without losing the use of her own. Though
it was both tedious and troublesome to converse
by the intervention of two different interpreters,
Cortes was so highly pleased with having disco-
vered this method of carrying on some inter-
course with the people of a country into which he
was determined to penetrate, that in the transports
of his joy he conlidered it as a visible interposition
of Providence in his favour '.

HE now learned, that the tv'o persons whom he Lands his

had received on board of his ship were deputies trops'
from Teutile and Pilpatoe, two officers entrusted
with the government of that province, by a great
monarch, whom they called Montezuma; and that
they were sent to inquire what his intentions were
in visiting their coast, and to offer him what as-

0 0 K finance he might need, in order to continue his
a__- voyage. Cortes, struck with the appearance of

5's' those people, as well as the tenor of the message,

assured them, in relpetful terms, that he approach.
ed their country with most friendly sentiments, and
came to propose matters of great importance to the
welfare of their prince and his kingdom, which he
would unfold more fully, in perlbn, to the go.
vernor and the general. Next morning, without
waiting for any answer, he landed his troops, his
horlcs, and artillery; and having chosen proper
ground, began to eret huts for his men, and to
fortify his camp. The natives, instead of oppcf.
ing the entrance of those fatal gucfts into their
country, afif'ted them in all their operations, with
an alacrity of which they had ere long good realon
to repent,

His frfin- JNEXT day, Teutile and Pilpatoe entered the
terview witth
the Mxi. Spanish camp with a numerous retinue, and Cortes

confidering them as the miniffers of a great
monarch, entitled to a degree of attention very
different from that which the Spaniards were ac.
customed to pay to the petty Cazitues, with
whom they had intercourse in the isles, received
them with much formal ceremony. He informed
them, that he came as ambaflador from Don
Carlos of Austria, king'of Castile, the greatlit
monarch of the East, and was intrufled with pro-
positions of such moment, that he could impart
them to none but the emperor Montezunia himn

ielf,

self, and therefore required them to conduct him, B o°° K
without loss of time, into the presence of their --
master. The Mexican officers could not conceal
their uneafnefs at a request, which they knew would
be disagreeable, and which they foresaw might
prove extremely embarrafling to their olvereign,
whose mind had been filled with many disquieting
apprehensions, ever since the former appearance of
the Spaniards on his coalts. But before they at-
tempted to diluade Cortes from insisting on this
demand, they endeavoured to conciliate his good-
will, by entreating him to accept of certain pre-
Icnts, which, as humble slaves of Montezuma,
they laid at his feet. They were introduced with,
great parade, and confiled of fine cotton cloth, of
plumes of various colours, and of ornaments of
gold and silver, to a considerable value; the
workmanship of which appeared to be as curious
as the materials were rich. The display of these
produced an effect very different from what the
Mexicans intended. Instead of satisfying, it in-
creased the avidity of the Spaniards, and rendered
them to eager and impatient to become maiters of
a country which abounded with such precious pro-
ductions, that Cortes could hardly liften with pa-
tience to the arguments which Pilpatoe and Teu-
tile employed to dissuade him from visiting the
capital, and in a haughty determined tone he in-
lifted on his demand, of being admitted to a per-
tonal audience of their lbvereign. During this
interview, tome painters, in the train ot the Mexi-

fhiips, the horses, the artillery, the soldiers, and

When Cortes obfcrved this, and was informed
that there pi&ures were to be sent to Montezuna,
in order to convey to him a more lively idea of
the strange and wonderful objets now presented
to their view, than any words could communicate,
he resolved to render the representation Rill more
animated and interesting, by exhibiting such a
fpeaacle as might -give both them and their
monarch an -awful irmpreffion of the extraordinary
prowess of his followers, and the irresistible force
of their arms. The trumpets, by his order,
founded an alarm; the troops, in a moment,
formed in order of battle, the infantry performed
such martial exercises as were best suited to display
the effea of their different weapons; the horse, in
various evolutions, gave a specimen of their agility
and .strength; the artillery pointed towards the
.thick woods which firrounded the camp, were fired,
and made dreadful havoc among the trees. The
Mexicans looked on with that silent amazement,
which is natural when the mind is struck with ob-
jeds, which are both awful and above its compre-
henfion. But, at the explosion of the cannon,
many of them fled, some fell to the ground, and
al t.vere so much confounded at the fight of men
wvhol power so nearly resembled that of the gods,
that Cortes found it difficult to compose and re-
... ~ aaffire

afuire them. The painters had noW many hew B o o
objetls on which to exercise their art, and they put
their fancy on the stretch in order to invent figures Js'9'
and symbols to represent the extraordinary things
which they had seen.

MESSENGERS were immediately dispatched to Negocin-

tions with

Montezuma with those pictures, and a full account Aontezu-
of every thing that had passed since the arrival of
the Spaniards, and by them Cortes sent a present
of some European curiosities to Montezuma, which,
though of no great value, he believed would be
acceptable on account of their novelty. The
Mexican monarchs, in order to obtain early in-
formation of every occurrence in all the corners of
their extensive empire, had introduced a refinement
in police, unknown, at that time, in Europe. They
had couriers posted at proper stations along the
principal roads; and as these were trained to agi-
lity by a regular education, and relieved one an-
other at moderate distances, they conveyed intel-
ligence with surprising rapidity. Though the ca-.
pital in which Montezuma resided was above a
hundred and eighty miles from St. Juan de Ulua,
Cortes's presents were carried thither, and an an-
fwer to his demands was received in a few days.
'he fame officers who had hitherto treated with
the Spaniards, were employed to deliver this an-
Iwer; but as they knew how repugnant the deter-
mination of their master was to all the lchemes and
wilhes of the Spanilh commander, they would not

Eihpzents. For this purpose, they renewed the negociation,

by introducing a train of a hundred Indians, loaded
with presents sent to him by Montezuma. The
magnificence of these was such as became a great
monarch, and far exceeded any idea which the
Spaniards had hitherto formed of his wealth.
They were placed upon mats spread on the ground,
in such order, as Ihewed them to the greatest ad.
vantage. Cortes and his officers viewed, with ad.
rniration, the various manufa&ures of the country,
cotton tluffs so fine, and of such delicate texture,
as to resemble fillc; piEtures of animals, trees, and
other natural objecs, formed with feathers of dif.
ferent colours, disposed and mingled with such
fiill and elegance, as to rival the works of the
pencil in truth and beauty of imitation. But
what chiefly attraced their eyes, were two large
plates of a circular form, one of massive gold re-
presenting the fun, the other of silver, an emblem
of the moon m. These were accompanied with
bracelets, collars, rings, and other trinkets of
gold; and that nothing might be wanting which
could give the Spaniards a complete idea of what
the country afforded, with some boxes filled with
pearls, precious flones, and grains of gold un-
wrought, as they had been found in the mines
or rivers. Cortes received all there with an

mand, as he could not, without dishonour, return
to his own country, until he was admitted into the
presence of the prince whom he was appointed to
visit in the name of his sovereign. The Mexicans,
allonifhed at feeing any man dare to oppose that
will, which they were accustomed to confider as
supreme and irrtfillible, yet afraid of precipitating
their country into an open rupture with such for-
midable enemies, prevailed with Cortes to promise,

t _-v-.. as an enemy. The latter was what might have

I5s9' been expected from a haughty prince in poffefion

of extensive power. The Mexican empire, at this
period, was at a pitch of grandeur to which no so.
ciety ever attained in so short a period. Thotgh
it had subsisted, according to their own traditions,
only a hundred and thirty years, its dominion ex-
tended from the North to the South Sea, over terri-
rories firetching, with tome inhall interruption, above
five hundred leagues from east to weft, and more
than two hundred from north to south, comprehend.
ing provinces not inferior in fertility, population, and
opulence, to any in the torrid zone. The people were
warlike and enterprising ; the authority of the mo-
tardeh unbounded, and his revenues considerable,
If, with the forces which might have been fud.
denly aflembled in such an empire, Montezuma
had fallen upon the Spaniards while encamped
on a barren unhealthy coast, unsupported by any
ally, without a place of retreat, and destitute of
provisions, it seems to be impoflible, even with all
the advantages. of their superior discipline and arms,
that they could have stood the ihock, and they
nLuft either have perified in such an unequal con-
test, or have abandoned the enterprise.

Charaer of As the power of Montezuma enabled him to
the mo.-
parch, take this spirited part, his own dispositions were

such as seemed naturally to prompt him to it.
Of all the princes who had swayed the Mexican
sceptre, he was the mofl: haughty, the mod

violent,

violent, and the troft impatient of controul. Hiis B O o
subje&s looked up to him with awe, and his v
enemies with terror. The former he governed '5'9
with unexampled rigour, but they were impressed
with such an opinion of his capacity, as com-
manded their refpe&; and, by many victories over
thelatter, he had spread far the_dread of his arms,
and had added several considerable provinces to
his dominions. But though his talents might be
suited to the transactions of a state so imperfectly
polished as the Mexican empire, and sufficient to
conduct them while in their accustomed courte,
they were altogether inadequate to a conjuncture so
extraordinary, and did not qualify him either to
judge with the difcernmenr, or to aft with the de-
cifion, requisite in such a trying energence.

FROM the moment that the Spaniards appeared His perplex.

on his coast, he discovered symptoms of timidity roYr po the
and embarraflmenr. Instead of taking such refo- Spaniards.
lutions as the confcioufniefs of his own power, or
the memory of his former exploits, might have in-
spired, he deliberated with an anxiety and hefita-
tion which did not escape the notice of his meanest
courtiers. The perplexity and discomposure of
Montezuma's mind upon this occasion, as well as
the general difm:!y of his fuhijets, were not owing
wholly to the impreffon whidi the Spaniards h;id
made by the novelty of their appearance and the
terror of their arms. Its origin may be traced up
to a more remote oburce. There was an opinion,

if

Is o o K if we may believe the earliest and most authentic
.---.. Spanilh historians, almost universal among the

l'9' Americans, that some dreadful calamity was im.

pending over their heads, from a race of formi.
dable invaders who should come from regions to.
wards the riling fun, to overrun and desolate thleir
country. Whether this disquieting apprehension
flowed from the memory of some natural calamity
which had affliaed that part of the globe, and im.
prefled the minds of the inhabitants with fuperfti.
tious fears and forebodings, or whether it was an
imagination accidentally suggested by the aftonifl.
ment which the first fight of a new race of men
occasioned, it is impossible to determine. But as
the Mexicans were more prone to fuperltition than
any people in the New World, they were more
deeply affeaed with the appearance of the Spa-
niards, whom their credulity instantly representcd
as the instruments defined to bring about this fa.
tal revolution which they dreaded. Under thole
circumstances, it ceases to be incredible that a
handful of adventurers should alarm the monarch
of a great empire, and all his fubjets °.

the order enjoining him to leave the country, Monte- B oo o
zuma assumed some degree of resolution, and, in v
a transport of rage natural to a fierce prince un- '5'9
accustomed to meet with any opposition to his
will, he threatened to sacrifice those presumptuous
men to his gods. But his doubts and fears
quickly returned, and instead of issuing orders to
carry his threats into execution, he again called his
ministers to confer and offer their advice. Feeble
and temporizing measures will always be the result
when men assemble to deliberate in a situation
where they ought to ad. The Mexican counsel-
lors took no effectual measure for expelling such
troublesome intruders, and were satisfied with if-
suing a more positive injun&ion, requiring them
to leave the country; but this they preposterously
accompanied with a present of such value, as
proved a frelh inducement to remain there.

MEANWHILE, the Spaniards were not without Anxietyard
solicitude or a variety of sentiments, in delibe- ~i,,o of the
rating concerning their own future condut. From Span'ilds.
what they had already seen, many of them formed
such extravagant ideas concerning the opulence
of the country, that, despising danger or hard-
flips, when they had in view treasures which ap-
peared to be incxhauftible, they were eager to at-
tempt the conquefL Others, .efttinating the power

for bold measures, and cherished their romantic
hopes, as such ideas corresponded with his own,
and favoured the execution of the schemes which
he had formed. From the time that the suspicions

would obftruf and embarrass all his operations,
and watched for a proper opportunity of coming
to a final rupture with him. Having this in
-iew, he had laboured by every art to secure the
efieem and affecion of his soldiers. With liis
abilities for command, it was easy to gain their
esteem; and his followers were quickly satisfied
that they might rely, with perfelt confidence, on
the condOit and courage of their leader. Nor was
it more difficult to acquire their affection. Among
adventurers, nearly of the fame rank, and serving
at their own expence, the dignity of command did
not elevate a general above mingling with those
who a'ted under him. Cortes availed himFflf of

part of his soldiers so firmly to himself, that they

DURING those intrigues, Teutile arrived with His addrrcj

in carryir)g

the present from Montezuma, and, together with tiemon,
it, delivered the ultimate order of that monarch
to depart instantly out of his dominions; and
when Cortes, instead of complying, renewed his
requef of an audience, the Mexican turned from
him abruptly, and quitted the camp with looks
and gestures which strongly expressed his surprise
and resentment. Next morning, none of the na-
tives, who used to frequent the camp in great
numbers, in order to barter with the soldiers, and
to bring in provisions, appeared. All friendly
correspondence seemed now to be at an end, and
it was expected every moment that hostilities
would commence. This, though an event that
might have been foreseen, occasioned a sudden
consternation among the Spaniards, which em-
boldened the adherents of Velasquez not only to
murmur and cabal against their general, but to
appoint one of their number to remonltrate openly
against his imprudence in attempting the conquest

i5 T9 order to refit the fleet and augment the army.

Diego de Ordaz, one of his principal officers,
whom the-malcontents charged with this com-
mifllon, delivered it with a soldierly freedom and
bluntness, assuring Cortes that he spoke the senti-
ments of the whole army. He listened to this re.
monstrance without any appearance of emotion, and
as he well knew the temper and wishes of his fol.
diers, and foresaw how they would receive a pro-
position fatal at once to all the splendid hopes and
'chemes which they had been forming with such
complacency, he carried his dissimulation so far as
to teem to rclinquilh his own measures in compli-
ance with the request of Ordaz, and iflued orders
that the army should be in readiness next day to
reimbark for Cuba. As soon as this was known,
the disappointed adventurers exclaimed and threat-
ened; the emissaries of Cortes, mingling with
them, inflamed their rage; the ferment became
general; the whole camp was almost in open mu-
tiny; all demanding with eagerness to fee their
commander. Cortes was not flow in appearing,
when, with one voice, officers and soldiers ex-
prefled their aftoninfment and indignation at the
orders which they had received. It was unworthy,
they cried, of the Castilian courage, to be daunted
at the first aspect of danger, and infamous to fly
before any enemy appeared. For their parts, they
were determined not to rclinquill an entcrprili,

that

that had hitherto been successful, and which B o O
tended so visibly to spread the knowledge of true
religion, and to advance the glory and interest of '5I9'
their country. Happy under his command, they
would follow him with alacrity through every
danger, in quest of those settlements and treasures
which he had so long held out to their view; but
if he chose rather to return to Cuba, and tamely
give up all his hopes of diftintion and opulence
to an envious rival, they would instantly chufe an-
other general to conduct them in that path of
glory, which he had not spirit to enter.

CORTES, delighted with their ardour, took no
offence at the boldness with which it was uttered.
The sentiments were what he himself had inspired,
and the warmth of exprefion satisfied him that his
followers had imbibed them thoroughly. He as-
feted, however, to be surprised at what he heard,
declaring that his orders to prepare for embark-
ing were issued from a persuasion that this was
agreeable to his troops; that, from deference to
what he had been informed was their inclina-
tion, he had sacrificed his own private opinion,
which was firmly bent on eftablifling immedi-
ately a settlement on the sea-coast, and then on
endeavouring to penetrate into the interior part of
the country; that now he was convinced of his
error; and as he perceived that they were ani-
mated with the generous spirit whichlbreathed in
every true Spaniard, he would resume, with fresh

i' o. 6 K ardour, his original plan of operation, and doubted

J

.v-' . .not to conduEt them, in the career of victory, to
'5'9* such independent fortunes as their valour merited.

Upon this declaration, fibu'ts of applause tertified
the excess of their joy. The measure seemed to be
taken with unanimous consent; such as secretly
condemned it being obliged to join in the acclama.
tions, partly to conceal their difaffetion from their
general, and partly to avoid the imputation of cow.
ardice from their fellow-foldiers r.

Efablifhes a WITHOUT allowing his men time to cool or to
form of civil
government, refle't, Cortes set about carrying his design into

execution., In order to give a beginning to a to.
lony, he afiembled the principal persons in his
army, and by their suffrage elected a council and
niagiItiates in whom the government was to be
vested. As men naturally transplant the inftitu-
tions and' forms of the mother-country into their
hew fettlernents, this was framed upon the model
of a Spanish corporation. The magistrates were
distinguished by the fame names and ensigns of
office, and were to exercise a firilar jurisdiction.
All the persons chosen were most firmly devoted
to Cortes, and the instrument of their election was
framed in the'king's name, without any mention
of their dependance on Velasquez. The two prin-
ciples of avarice and enthusiasm, which prompted
the Spaniards to all their enterprises in the New

tinguilhed by a tranlation of great moment. As
soon as it assembled, Cortes applied for leave to
enter; and approaching with many marks of pro-
found refpeat, which added dignity to the tribunal,
and set an example of reverence for its authority,
he began a long harangue, in which, with much
art, and in terms extremely flattering to peribns
jult entering upon their new funation, he observed,
that as the supreme jurifdiEtion over the colony
which they had planted was now vetled in this
court, he confidered them as clothed with the au-
thority, and representing the person of their fove-
reign; that accordingly he would communicate to
them what he deemed essential to the public
safety, with the fame dutiful fidelity as if he were
addressing his royal matter ; that the security of a
colony fettled in a great empire, whose sovereign
had already discovered his hoflile intentions, de-
pended upon arms, and the efficacy of these upon
the subordination and discipline preserved among
the troops; that his right to command was derived
from a commission granted by the governor of
Cuba; and as that had been long since revoked, the
lawfulness of his jurildiEtion might well be quef-
tioned; that he might be thought to at upon a de-

dependance on the governor of Cuba, accepted
of the commiflion, which vcfted in him supreme
jurifdition, civil as well as military, over the co-
lony, with many professions of refpef to the
council, and gratitude to the army. Together
with his new command, he aflumed greater dig-
nity, and began to exercise more extensive powers.
Formerly he had felt himself to be only the
deputy of a subjed; now he ated as the repre-
fentative of his sovereign. The adherents of Ve-
lafquez, fully aware of what would be the effec
of this change in the situation of Cortes, could no
longer continue silent and panfive fpedators of his
acions. They exclaimed openly against the pro-
ceedings of the council as illegal, and against
thoIe of the army as mutinous. Cortes, instantly
perceiving the neceflity of giving a timely check
to such seditious discourse by rome vigorous mea-

claim than to punish his prisoner.s, who were offi.
cers of great merit, courted their frlendfhip with
such assiduity and addrels, that the reconciliation
was perfectly cordial; and, on the most trying oc-
cafions, neither their connrction with the governor
of Cuba, nor the memory of the indignity with
which they had been treated, tempted them to
swerve from an inviolable attachment to his in.
terest s. In this, as well as his other negociations
at this critical conjuncture, which decided with re-

much of his success to the Mexican gold, which he
distributed with a liberal hand both among his
friends and his opponents '.

quit the car-p in which he had hitherto remained, and
advance into the country. To this he was encouraged
by an event no less fortunate than seasonable. Some
Indians having approached his camp in a mysterious

,nanner, were introduced into his pretence. He B o o K
found that they were sent with a proffer of friend- A
flip from the cazique of Zempoalla, a conliderable 519
town at no great distance; and from their answers
to a variety of questions which he put to them, ac-
cording to his usual practice in every interview with I;
the people of the country, he gathered, that their
matter, though subjea to the Mexican empire,
was impatient of the yoke, and filled with such
dread and hatred of Montezuma, that nothing
could be more acceptable to him than any pro-
sped of deliverance from the oppression under
which he groaned. On hearing this, a ray of
light and hope broke in upon the mind of Cortes.
He saw that the great empire which he intended
to attack was not united, nor its sovereign be-
loved. He concluded, that the causes of difaf-
section could not be confined to one province, but
that in other corners there muff be malcontents,
so weary of fubjedtion, or so desirous of change,
as to be ready to follow the standard of any pro-
tenor. Full of those ideas, on which he began to
form a scheme, that time, and more perfect in-
formation concerning the fiate of the country, en-
abled him to mature, he gave a most gracious re-
ception to the Zempoallans, and promiscd soon to
visit their cazique u.

B3 0 K fixed for his march. Some officers, whom he had

i-- employed to survey the coast, having discovered a
35'9. village named Quiabiflan, about forty miles to

the northward, which, both on account of the
fertility of the foil, and commodiousness of the
harbour, seemed to be a more proper station Tor a
settlement than that where he was encamped,
Cortes determined to remove thither. Zempoalla
lay in his way, where the cazique received him in
the manner which he had reason to expect; with
gifts and caresses, like a man solicitous to gain his
good-will ; with relpec approaching almost to ado-
ration, like one who looked up to him as a deli-
verer. From him he learned many particulars
with respect to the charafter of M/ontezuma, and
the circumstances which rendered his dominion odi-
ous. He was a tyrant, as the cazique told him
with tears, haughty, cruel, and suspicious; who
treated his own subje&s with arrogance, ruined the
conquered provinces by exceflive exacions, and
often tore their sons and daughters from them by
violence; the former to be offered as victims to his
gods; the latter, to be reserved as concubines for
himself or favourites. Cortes, in reply to him, art-
fully insinuated, that one great object of the Spa-
niards in visiting a country so remote from their own,
was to redress grievances, and to relieve the op-
pressed; and having encouraged him to hope for
this interposition in due time, he continued his
march to Quiabiflan.

THE

THE spot which his officers had recommended as B oo K

a proper situation, appeared to him to be so well ---
chosen, that he immediately marked out ground ,3uihaioro.
for a town. The houies to be erected were only
huts; but these were to be surrounded with forti-
fications, of sufficient strength to resist the aiafults
of an Indian army. As the finishing of those for-
tifications was essential to the existence of a colony,
and of no lets importance in prosecuting the designs
which the leader and his followers meditated, both
in order to secure a place of retreat, and to pre-
serve their communication with the sea, every man
in the army, officers as well as soldiers, put his
hand to the work, Cortes himself setting them an
example of activity and perseverance in labour.
The Indians of Zempoalla and Quiabiflan lent
their aid; and this petty station, the parent of so
many mighty settlements, was soon in a ltate of
defence x.

them with great indignity, and, as their fuperftil

cans, they prepared to sacrifice them to their
gods. From this '.:ift danger they were delivered
by the interposition of Cortes, who manifcftcd the
utmost horror at the mention of such a deed. The
two caziques having now been pushed to an ac
of such open rebellion, as left them no hope of

Si'aiiarls, they ioon completed their union with
them, by formally acknowledging themselves to
be vassals of the fame monarch. Their example
was followed by the Totopaques, a fierce people

diftinguifled by martial exploits, every moment B oV. K
had been employed in operations, which, though ----
less splendid, were more important. By his ad-
dress in condueting his intrigues with his own
army, as well as his sagacity in carrying on his
negociations with the natives, he had already laid
the foundations of his future success. But what-
ever confidence he might place in the plan which
he had formed, he could not but perceive, that
as his title to command was derived from a doubt-
ful authority, he held it by a precarious tenure.
The injuries which Velasquez had received, werd
such as would naturally prompt him to apply for
redress to their comnmon sovereign; and such a
representation, he foresaw, might be given of his
conduct, that he had reason to apprehend, not
only that he might be degraded from his present
rank, but fubjedted to punishment. Before he
began his march, it was necessary to take the
most effeaual precautions against this impending
danger. With this view he persuaded the magi-
firates of the colony at Vera Cruz to address a let-
ter to the king, the chief object of which was to
jutify their own condu6t in establishing a colony
independant on the jurifdiIion of Velasquez. In
order to accomplih this, they endeavoured to de-
traft from his merit, in fitting out the two former
armaments under Cordova and Grijalva, affirming
that there had been equipped by the adventurers
who engaged in the expeditions, and not by the
governor. They contend that the sole object of

Vela;fq uez

B o0 K Velasquez was to trade or barter with the natives,

.---.- not to attempt the conquest of New Spain, or to

fettle a colony there. They afert that Cortes and
the pfficers who served under him had defrayed the
greater part of the expence in fitting out the arna-
ment. On this account, they humbly requeled
their sovereign to ratify what they had done in his
name, and to confirm Cortes in the supreme com-
mand by his royal commifflon. That Charles might
be induced to grant more readily what they de-
manded, they give him a pompous description of
the country which they had discovered; of its
riches, the number of its inhabitants, their civili-
zation and arts; they relate sthe progress which
they had already made in annexing some partsof
the country situated on the sea-coast to the crown
of Castile; and mention the schemes which they had
formed, as well as the hopes which they entertain-
ed, of reducing the whole to fubjeetion Y. Cortes

r In this letter it is asserted, that though a considerable

number of Spaniards had been wounded in their various en.
counters with the people of Tabasco, not one of them died,
and all had recovered in a very Ihort time. This fcems to
confirm what I observe in p. 28o, concerning the imperfec-
tion of the offensive weapons used by the Americans. In this
letter, the human sacrifices offered by the Mexicans to their
deities are describcd minutely, and with great horror; some of
the Spaniards, it is said, had been eye-witnelres of those bar-
barous rites. To the letter is Subjoined a catalogue and de-

himself wrote in a similar strain; and as he knew B o o K-
that the Spanilh court, accustomed to the exagger- --
ated representations of every new country by its
discoverers, would give little credit to their fplen-
did accounts of New Spain, if there were not ac-
companied with such a specimen of what it con-
tained, as would excite an high idea of its opu-
lence, he solicited his soldiers to relinquilh what
they might claim as their part of the treasures which
had hitherto been collected, in order that the whole
might be sent to the king. Such was the ascend-
ant which he had acquired over their minds, and
such their own romantic expectations of future
wealth, that an army of indigent and rapacious ad-
venturers was capable of this generous effort, and
offered to their sovereign the richest present that
had hitherto been transmitted from the New
World . Portocarrero and Montejo, the chief
magistrates of the colony, were appointed to carry
this present to Castile, with express orders not to
touch at Cuba in their passage thither .

WHILE a vessel was preparing for their de- Aconfpi-
parture, an unexpeEted event occasioned a general cotrTc
alarm. Some soldiers and tailors, secretly attached
to Velasquez, or intimidated at the profpet of
the dangers unavoidable in attempting to pene-
trate into the heart of a great empire with such

as might enable him to intercept the ship which

ing apprehcnCions, and prompted him to execute a
fchelne which he had long revolved. He per-
ceived that the spirit of difaffedtion still lurked
among his troop's that though hitherto checked
by the uniform success of his schemes, or sup-
prefled by the hand of authority, various events
might,occur which would encourage and call it
forth. He observed, that many of his men,
weary of the fatigue of service, longed to revisit
their settlements in Cuba; and that upon any ap-
pearance of extraordinary danger, or any reverse
of fortune, it would be impoflible to reltrain them
from returning thither. He was sensible that his
forces, already too feeble, could bear no diminu-
tion, and that a very small defection of his fol-
lowers would oblige him to abandon the enter-

prise. After ruminating often, and with much B oo K
solicitude, upon those particulars, he saw no hope -
offuccefs, but in cutting off all possibility of re- 5
treat, and reducing his men to the necessity of
adopting the fame relblution wi'th which he him-
self was animated, either to conquer or to perish.
With this view, he determined to destroy his
fleet; but as he durst not venture to execute such
a bold resolution by his tingle authority, he la-
boured to bring his soldiers to adopt his ideas
with respect to the propriety of this measure. His
address in .accomplishing this was not inferior to
the arduous occasion in which it was employed.
He persuaded tome, that the (hips had luffered so
much by having been long at lea, as to be alto-
gether unfit for leirvice; to others he pointed out
what a seasonable reinforcement of strength they
would derive fiom the juntion of an hundred men,
now unprofitably employed as tailors; and to all,
he represented the neceltity of fixing their eyes and
wishes upon what was before them, without allow-
ing the idea of a retreat once to enter their
thoughts. With universal con!cnt the Ihips were
drawn ashore, and after stripping them of their
fails, rigging, iron works, and whatever ellc might
be of ule, they were broke in pieces. Thus, from
an effort of magnanimity, to which there is nothing
parallel in hiffory, five hundred men voluntarily
contented to be slut up in a h1.Jile country, fillc
with powerful and unLnonxn nations; and( having

NOTHING now retarded Cortes; the alacrity of

his troops and the disposition of his allies were
equally favourable. All the advantages, how.
ever, derived from the latter, though procured
by much assiduity and address, were well nigh
loft in a moment by an indiscreet sally of reli-
gious zeal, which, on many occasions, precipi-
tated Cortes into actions inconfifteni with the pru-
dence that distinguishes his character. Tihough
hitherto he had neither time nor opportunity to
explain to the natives the errors of their own fu-
perltition, or to instruct them in the principles of
the Christian faith, he commanded his soldiers to
overturn the altars and to destroy the idols in the
chief temple of Zempoalla, and in their place to
erec a crucifix and an image of the Virgin Mary.
The people beheld this with astonishment and
horror; the priests excited them to arms; but
such was the authority of Cortes, and Ib great
the ascendant which the Spaniards had acquired,
that the commotion was appeased without blood-
fled, and concord perfc:tly re-eftablifledc.

teen horse, and fix field-pieces. The reft of his 3 o0o K
troops, conrifting chiefly of such as from age or ---
infirmity were less fit for active service, he left as 5
a garrison in Villa Rica, under the command of
Efcalante, an officer of merit, and warmly at-
tached to his interest. The cazique of Zem-
poalla supplied him with provisions, and with two
hundred of tliofe Indians called Tam2emes, whose
office, in a country where tame animals were un-
known, was to carry burdens, and perform all
servile labour. They were a great relief to the
Spanish soldiers, who hitherto had been obliged,
not only to carry their own baggage, but to drag
along the artillery by main force. He offered
likewise a considerable body of his troops, but
Cortes was satisfied with four hundred; taking
care, however, to chufe persons of such note as
might prove hostages for the fidelity of their
matter. Nothing memorable happened in his
progress, until he arrived on the confines of Tlaf-
cala. The inhabitants of that province, a warlike
people, were implacable enemies of the Mexicans,
and had been united in an ancient alliance with
the caziques of Zempoalla. Though less civi-
lized than the subje&s of Montezuma, they were
advanced in improvement far beyond the rude na-
tions of America, whose manners we have de-
fcribed. They had made considerable progress in
agriculture; they dwelt in large towns; they were
not firangers to some species of commerce; and in

T 2 t.he

B o0 K the imperfect accounts of their institutions and

V.
.-,--. laws, transmitted to us by the early Spanish writers,

we discern traces both of distributive justice and of
criminal jurisdiction, in their interior police. But
frill, as the degree of their civilization was incom.
plete, and as they depended for fubliftence not on
agriculture alone, but trusted for it, in a great
measure, to hunting, they retained many of the
qualities natural to men in this s'tate. Like them,
they were fierce and revengeful; like them, too,
they were high-fpiritcd and independent. In con-
sequence of the former, they were involved in per-
petual hostilities, and had but a lender and occa-
fional intercourse with neighbouring states. The
latter inspired them with tuch detestation of fervi-
tude, that they not only refused to stoop to a so-
reign yoke, and maintained an obstinate and.fuc-
celsful contest in defence of their liberty against
the superior power of the Mexican empire, but
they guarded with equal solicitude againit d,-
meftic tyranny; and disdaining to acknowl.dgc
any master, they lived under the mild and limited
jurildition of a council elected by their fevcral
tribes.

His war CORTES, though he had received information
Tfrcalans. concerning the martial character of this people,

flattered. himlfelf that his profefions of dclivering
the oppressed from the tyranny of Montezuma,
their inveterate enmity to the Mexicans, and the

17 cxa7ni'!lC

example of their ancient allies the Zempoallans, B o o K
might induce the Tlafcalans to grant him a friendly _
reception. In order to dispose them to this, four 519'
Zempoallans of great eminence were sent ambaf-
fadors, to request, in his name, and in that of
their cazique, that they would permit the Spa-
niards to pass through the territories of the re-
public in their way to Mexico. But inftcad of the
favourable answer which was expeded, the Tlaf-
calans seized the ambassadors, and, without any
regard to their public character, made prepara-
tions for sacrificing them to their gods. At the
fame time, they assembled their troops, in order
to oppose those unknown invaders, if they should
attempt to make their passage good by force of
arms. Various motives concurred in precipitating
the Tlafcalans into this resolution. A fierce peo-
ple, fiut up within its own narrow precincts, and
little accustomed to any intercourle with foreign-
ers, is apt to confider every stranger as an enemy,
and is easily excited to arms. They concluded,
from Cortes's propolal of visiting Montezuma in
his capital, that, notwithstanding all his profef-
sions, he courted the friendflip of a monarch
whom they both hated and feared. The impru-
dcnt zeal of Cortes in violating the temples in
Zempoalla, filled the Tlafcalans with horror; and
as they were no les attached to their fuperfitiion
than the other nations of New Spain, they were
impatient to avenge their injured gods, and to ,ac-

not yet nieafured their own strength with thole
new enemies, and had no idea of the fuperio-
rity which they derived from their arms and dif.
cipline.
Aug. 10. CORTES, after waiting some days, in vain, for

ccf ithe return of his ambassadors, advanced into the

Tlafcalan territories. As the resolutions of people
who delight in war are executed with no less
promptitude than they are formed, he found
troops in the field ready to oppose him. They
attacked him with great intrepidity, and, in the
first encounter, wounded some of the Spaniards,
and killed two horses; a loss, in their lituation,
of great moment, because it was irreparable. From
this fpccimen of their courage, Cortes saw the
necessity of proceeding with caution. His army
marched in close order; he chore the stations,
where he halted, with attention, and forti!icd
every camp with extraordinary care. During four-
teen days he was exposed to alnoft uninterrupted
afaults, the Tlafcalans advancing with numerous
at mies, and renewing the attack in various forms,
with a degree of valour and perseverance to which
the Spaniards had seen nothing parallel in the Ncv
Woild. The Spanish hillorians delfribe thole

Though the Tlafcalans brought into the field fich
vas armies as appear sufficient to have overwhelmed
the Spaniards, they were never able to make any
impression upon their finall battalion. Singular
as this may seem, it is not inexplicable. The
Tlafcalans, though addicted to war, were, like
all unpolifhed nations, strangers to military order
and discipline, and loft in a great nmeafure the ad-
vantage which they might have derived from their
numbers, and the impetuosity of their attack, by
their constant solicitude to carry off the dead and
W0iided. Thlis point of honour, founded on 4

B 0 o K sentiment of tenderness natural to the human mind,

V. c-v»v and strengthened by anxiety to preserve the bodies
J-519' of their countrymen from being devoured by theil

enemies, was universal among the people of New
Spain. Attention to this pious office occupied
them, even during the heat of combat , broke
their union, and diminished the force of the im-
preflion which they might have made by a joint
effort.

NOT only was their superiority in number of

little avail, but the imperfection of their military
weapons rendered their valour in a great mealfLre
inoffinfive. After three battles, and many fkir-
milhcs and assaults, not one Spaniard was killed
in the field. Arrows and spears, headed wiih
flint or the bones of filhes, fiakes hardened in the
fire, and wooden iwords, though deftruEtive wea-
pons among naked Indians, were easily turned
fidcle by the Spanilh bucklers, and could hardly
penetrate tie cfaziiies, or quilted jackets, which
the soldiers wore. The Tlafcalans advanced boldly
to the charge, and often fought haLad to lhad.
Many of the Spaniards were wounded, thougli all
slightly, which cannot be imputed to any want o,
cou-ragc or Ilrength in their enemies, but to tle dc-
icc of the arms with which they afailied them.

have condu&ed their hostilities with some degree B O O K
of barbarous generosity. They gave the Spaniards --
warning of their hostile intentions, and as they 9
knew that their invaders wanted provisions, and
imagined, perhaps, like the other Americans, that
they had left their own country because it did not
afford them subsistence, they sent to their camp a
large supply of poultry and maize, desiring them
toeat plentifully, because they ifcorned to attack
an enemy enfeebled by hunger, and it would be
an affront to their Gods to offer them famished vic-
tims, as well as diiagreeable to themselves to feed
on such emaciated prey f.

WHEN they were taught by the first encounter
with their new enemies, that it was not easy to
execute this threat; when they perceived, in the
subsequent engagements, that notwithstanding all
the efforts of their own valour, of which they had
a very high opinion, not one of the Spaniards was
slain or taken, they began to conceive them to be
a superior order of beings, against whom human
power could not avail. In this extremity, they
had recourle to their priests, requiring them to re-

events, and to declare what new means they should
enmploy in order to repulse thole formidable in-

withdrawn, their vigour declined and faded like
the herbs in the field, and they dwindled down
into mortal men g. Theories less plausible have
gained credit with more enlightened nations, and
have influenced their condul. In consequence of
this, the Tlafcalans, with the inmplicit confidence
of men who fancy themselves to be under the
guidance of Heaven, acted in contradiction to one
of their most established maxims in war, and ven.
tured to attack the enemy, with a strong body, in
the night-time, in hopes of destroying them when
enfeebled and surprised. But Cortes had greater
vigilance and discernment than to be deceived by
the rude stratagems of an Indian army. The cen-
tinels at his out polls, observing some extraordi-
nary movement among the Tlalcalans, gave the
alarm. In a moment the troops were under arms,
and sallying out, dispersed the party with great
slaughter, without allowing it to approach the
camp. The Tlafcalans, convinced, by lad expe-
rience, that their priests had deluded them, and
satisfied that they attempted in vain, either to de-

THEY were at a loss, however, in what manner The TI;fca-
to address the strangers, what idea to form of their to pea"ed
character, and whether to confider them as beings
of a gentle or of a malevolent nature. There were
circumstances in their conduct which seemed to
favour each opinion. On the one hand, as the
Spaniards conflantly dismissed the prisoners whom
they took, not only without injury, but often
with presents of European toys, and renewed their
offers of peace after every viEtory; this lenity
amazed people, who, according to the exterminat-
ing system of war known in America, were accuf-
tomed to sacrifice and devour without mercy all the
captives taken in battle, and disposed them to en-
tertain favourable sentiments of the humanity of their
new enemies. But, on the other hand, as Cortes
had seized fifty of their countrymen who brought
provisions to his camp, and supposing them to be
Ipies, had cut off their hands h ; this bloody spec-
tacle, added to the terror occasioned by the fire-
arms and horses, filled them with dreadful im-
preflions of the ferocity of their invaders i. This
uncertainty was apparent in the mode of address-
ing the Spaniards. " If, said they, you are divini-
lies of a cruel and savage nature, we prcfent to you
five laives, that you may drink their blood, and eat

such intolerable toil and hardships, many of the B o0o K

Mexican nation was no less implacable than had
been represented, and perceived what benefit he
n-,ight derive from the aid of such powerful con-
federates, he employed all his powers of infinua.
tion in order to gain their confidence. Nor wds
any extraordinary exertion of thele necessary. The
Tlafcalans, with the levity of mind natural to un.
polished men, were, of their own accord, dil-polfd
to run from the extreme of hatred to that of fnd.
ness. Every thing in the appearance and condud
of their guests, was to them matter of wonder',
They gazed with admiration at whatever the Spa.
niards did, and fancying them to be of heavenly
origin, were eager not only to comply with their
demands, but to anticipate their wishes. They
offered, accordingly, to accompany Cortes in I;is

public, under the conmmand of their mort cxpri-.

ments employed by Heaven to propagate the B o o K
Christian faith, and the less they were qualified, c-
either by their knowledge or morals for such a '5'9'
funEtion, they were more eager to discharge it.
The profound veneration of the Tlafcalans for the
Spaniards, having encouraged Cortes to explain
to some of their chiefs the dotrines of the Christ-
ian religion, and to insist that they should aban-
don their own superstitions, and embrace the faith
of their new friends, they, according So an idea
universal among barbarous nations, readily ac-
knowledged the truth and excellence of what he
taught; but contended, that the 'Teules of Tlafcala
were divinities no less than the God in whom the
Spaniards believed; and as that Being was intitled
to the homage of Europeans, so they were bound
to revere the fame powers which their ancestors
had worshipped. Cortes continued, nevertheless,
to urge his demand in a tone of authority, min-
gling threats with his arguments, until the Tlafca-
lans could bear it no longer, and conjured him
never to mention this again, left the gods fliould
avenge on their heads the guilt of having liltencd
to such a proposition. Cortes, astonished and en-
raged at their obflinacy, prepared to execute by
force, what he could not accomplish by persuasion,
and was going to overturn their altars, and calt
down their idols with the fame violent hand as at
Zempoalla, if father Bartholemew de Olmedo,

proceeding at Zempoalla had always appeared to

converted by violence; that other weapons wecre
to be employed in this miniitry; patient inftruclion
must enlighten the understanding, and pious ex-
ample captivate the heart, before men could be
induced to abandon error, and embrace the truthP.
Amidflt scenes, where a narrow-minded bigotry
appears in such close union with opprefflon and
cruelty, sentiments so liberal and humane soothe
the mind with unexpeted pleasure; and at a time
when the rights of conscience were little under-
stood in the Christian world, and the idea of tolera-
tion unknown, one is astonished to find a Spanish
monk of the sixteenth century among the first ad.
vocates against persecution, and in behalf of reli-
gious liberty. The remonltrances of an ecclcfial-
tic, no less refpeitable for wildom than virtue,
had their proper weight with Cortes. lHe left the
Tlafcalans in the undisturbed exercise of their own
rites, requiring only that they flould defifL froin
their horrid practice of o.fering human viEitns in
sacrifice.

power of a prince so faithless and cruel as Monte-
zuma. As he was accompanied by fix thousand
Tlafcalans, he had now the command of forces
which resembled a regular army. They direeted on. .3,
their course towards Cholula; Montezuma, who
had at length consented to admit the Spaniards
into his presence, having informed Cortes, that
he had given orders for his friendly reception
there. Cholula was a considerable town, and
though only five leagues diflant from Tlafcala,
was formerly an independent state, but had been
lately fubje ted to the Mexican empire. This was
confidered by all the people of New Spain as a
holy place, the fanEluary and chief feat of their
gods, to which pilgrims retorted from every pro-
vince, and a greater number of human victims
were offered in its principal temple than even in
that of Mexico q. Montezuma seems to have in-
vited the Spaniards thither, either from tome
superstitious hope that the gods would not sus-
ser this sacred mansion to be defiled, without
pouring down their wrath upon those impious
trangers, who ventured to insult their power in
the place of its peculiar residence; or from a be-
lief that he himielf might there attempt to cut

The severity CORTES had been warned by the Tlafcalans, be.
of his proce.
dure there. fore he set out on his march, to keep a watchful

eye over the Cholulans. He himself, though re.
ceived into the town with much seeming refped
and cordiality, observed several circumstances in
their conduct which excited suspicion. Two of
the Tlafcalans, who were encamped at some
distance from the town, as the Cholulans refused
to admit their ancient enemies within its precints,
having found means to enter in disguise, acquainted
Cortes, that they observed the women and chil.
dren of the principal citizens retiring in great
hurry every night; and that fix children had been
sacrificed in the chief temple, a rite which indi.
cated the execution of some warlike enterprise to
be approaching. At the fame time, Marina the
interpreter received information from an Indian
woman of diftintion, whose confidence fle had
gained, that the deftrudtion of her friends was
concerted ; that a body of Mexican troops lay con-
cealed near the town; that some of the streets
were barricaded, and in others, pits or deep
trenches were dug, and sightly covered over, as
traps into which the horses might fall; that stones
and miflive weapons werL colleced on the tops of
the temples, with which to overwhelm the in-
fantry; that the fatal hour was now at hand, and
their ruin unavoidable. Cortes, alarmed at this

conctrrirsE

concurring evidence, secretly arrested three of the B o o oK
chief priests, and extorted from them a confession, I
that confirmed the intelligence which he had re- s159.
ceived. As not a moment was to be loft, he in-
ftantly resolved to prevent his enemies, and to in-
flit on them such dreadful vengeance as might
strike Montezuma and his fubjets with terror.
For this purpose, the Spaniards and Zempoallans
were drawn up in a large court, which had been
allotted for their quarters, near the centre of the
town; the Tlafcalans had orders to advance; the
magistrates, and several of the chief citizens were
sent for, under various pretexts, and seized. On
a signal given, the troops rushed out, and fell
upon the multitude, destitute of leaders, and so
much astonished, that the weapons dropping from
their hands, they stood motionless, and incapable
of defence. While the Spaniards pressed them in
front, the Tlafcalans attacked them in the rear.
The streets were filled with bloodlhed and death.
The temples, which afforded a retreat to the
priests and some of the leading men, were fct on
fire, and they perilbed in the flames. This icene
of horror continued two days; during which, the
wretched inhabitants suffered all that the deitruc-
tive rage of the Spaniards, or the implacable
revenge of their Indian allies, could inflict. At
length the carnage ceased, after the slaughter of
fix thousand Cholulans, without the loss of a
lingle Spaniard. Cortes then released the magif-
tratcs, and reproaching them bitterly for their in-

15')9 them to recal the citizens who had fled, and re.

establish order in the town. Such was the ascend.
ant which the Spaniards had acquired over. this fu.
perftitious race of men, and so deeply were they
impressed with an opinion of their superior discern.
ment, as well as power, that, in obedience to this
command, the city was in a few days filled again
with people, who, amidst the ruins of their sacred
buildings, yielded refpe&ful service to men, whose
hands were stained with the blood of their rela.
tions and fellow-citizensr.

oa. 29. FROM Cholula, Cortes advanced direcly to.
towards wards Mexico, which was only twenty leagues
Mexico, distant. In every place through which he pafled,

he was received as a person possessed of sufficient
power to deliver the empire from the oppression
under which it groaned ; and the caziques or go-
vernors communicated to him all the grievances
which they felt under the tyrannical government of
Montezuma, with that unreserved confidence which
men naturally repose in superior beings. When
Cortes first observed the feeds of dilcontent in the
remote provinces of the empire, hope dawned upon
his mind; but when he now discovered such fymp-
toms of alienation from their monarch near the

feat of government, he concluded that the vital B 0 o
parts of the constitution were affected, and con- .-,,
ceived the most sanguine expectations of overturn- 519'
ing a state, whose natural strength was thus
divided and impaired. While those reflections
encouraged the general to perfifl in his arduous
undertaking, the soldiers were no less animated by
observations more obvious to their capacity. In
descending from the mountains of Chalco, across
which the road lay, the vast plain of Mexico
opened gradually to their view. When they first Sirs view
beheld this profpec, one of the most striking and
beautiful on the face of the earth; when they ob-
served fertile and cultivated fields, stretching far-
ther than the eye could reach; when they saw a
lake resembling the sea in extent, encompassed
with large towns, and discovered the capital city
riling upon an ifand in the middle, adorned with
its temples and turrets; the scene so far exceeded
their imagination, that some believed the fanciful
descriptions of romance were realized, and that its
enchanted palaces and gilded domes were pre-
sented to their fight; others could hardly persuade
themselves that this wonderful fpeatacle was'any
thing more than a dream '. As they advanced,
their doubts were removed, but their amazement
increased. They were now fully satisfied that the
country was rich beyond any conception which
they had formed of it, and flattered themselves

red which led them to fufpe& that some design was
formed to surprise and cut them off. Many mef-
fengers arrived successively from Montezuma, per.
mitting them one day to advance, requiring them
on the next to retire, as his hopes or fears alter-
nately prevailed; and so wonderful was this infa-
tuation, which seems to be unaccountable on any
supposition but that of a superstitious dread of
the Spaniards, as beings of a fiperior nature, that
Cortes was almost at the gates of the capital, be-
fore the monarch had determined whether to re-
ceive him as a friend, or to oppose him as an enemy.
But as no sign of open hostility appeared, the
Spaniards, without regarding the flucuations of
Montezuma's sentiments, continued their march
along the causeway which led to Mexico through
the lake, with great circumspection and the ftriiteft
discipline, though without teeming to fufpeEt the
prince whom they were about to visit.

, WHEN they drew near the city, about a thou.
the.i .1it sand persons, who appeared to be of distinction,

came forth to meet them, adorned with plumes,
and clad in mantles of fine cotton. Each of these,
in his order, pased by Cortes, and saluted him
according to tle nuode deemed most refpeRful and

fubmirnit'

submissive in their country. They announced the n o o .
approach of Montezuma himself, and soon after
his harbingers came in fight, There appeared first '519'
two hundred persons in an uniform dress, with
large plumes of feathers, alike in fashion, march-
ing two and two, in deep silence, bare-footed, with
their eyes fixed on the ground. There were fol-
lowed by a company of higher rank, in their most
Ihowy apparel, in the midst of whom was Monte-
zuma, in a chair or litter richly ornamented with
gold, and feathers of various colours. Four of
his principal favourites carried him on their fhoul-
ders, others supported a canopy of curious work-
manlhip over his head. Before him marched
three officers with rods of gold in their hands,
which they lifted up on high at certain intervals,
and at that signal all the people bowed their
heads, and hid their faces, as unworthy to look
on so great a monarch. When he drew near,
Cortes dismounted, advancing towards him with
officious haste, and in a refpecfful pollture. At
the fame time Montezuma alighted from his chair,
and leaning on the arms of two of his near rela-
tions, approached with a flow and stately pace, his
attendants covering the street with cotton cloths,
that he might not touch the ground. Cortes ac-
coted him with profound reverence, after the Eu-
ropean fashion. He returned the salutation, ac-
cording to the mode of his country, by touching
the earth with his hand, and then kissing it. This
ceremony, the cuftolnary expreflion of veneration

U 4 from

A-I in rank, appeared such amazing condescension in
J519. a proud monarch, who s`carcely deigned to con.

fider the reft of mankind as of the fame species
with himself, that all his fubjeds firmly believed
those persons, before whom he humbled himself in
this manner, to be something more than *human.
Accordingly, as they marched through the crowd,
the Spaniards frequently, and with much fatisfac.
tion, heard themselves denominated Teules, or di-
vinities. Nothing material passed in this first in.
terview. Montezuma conduted Cortes to the
quarters which he had prepared for his reception,
and immediately took leave of him, with a politeness
not unworthy of a court more refined. " You are
now," fays he, " with your brothers in your own
house; refresh yourselves after your fatigue, and
be happy until I return t." The place allotted to
the Spaniards for their lodging was a house built
by the father of Montezuma. It was surrounded
by a stone-wall, with towers at proper distances,
which served for defence as well as for ornament,
and its apartments and courts were so large, as to
accommodate both'the Spaniards and their Indian
allies. The first care of Cortes was to take pre-
cautions for his security, by planting the artillery
so as to command the different avenues which
led to it, by appointing a large division of his

IN the evening, Montezuma returned to visit his His idea of

guests with the fame pomp as in their first inter- niards,
view, and brought presents of such value, not
only to Cortes and to his officers, but even to the
private men, as proved the liberality of the mo-
narch to be suitable to the opulence of his king-
dom. A long conference ensued, in which Cortes
learned what was the opinion of Montezuma with
refpet to the Spaniards. It was an established
tradition, he told him, among the Mexicans, that
their ancestors came originally from a remote re-
gion, and conquered the provinces now subject to
his dominion; that after they were fettled there,
the great captain who conducted this colony re-
turned to his own country, promising, that at
tome future period his descendants should vilit
them, assume !the government, and reform their
conltitution and laws; that, from what he had
heard and seen of Cortes and his followers, he
wa; convinced that they were the very persons
whtljfe appearance the Mexican traditions and pro-
phecies taught them to expet ; that accordingly
Ie had received them, not as strangers, but as re-
Lltions cf the fame blood and parentage, and de-
fired that they might confider themlelves as matiers
in his dominions, for both himself and his fubjeEts

should

B o o K should be ready to comply with their will' and

even to prevent their wishes. Cortes made a reply
'5'9* in his usual flyle, with refpeft to the dignity and

power of his sovereign, and his intention in fend.
ing him into that country; artfully endeavouring
so to frame his discourse, that it might coincide as
much as possible with the idea which Montezuma
had formed concerning the origin of the Spaniards.
Next morning, Cortes and some of his principal
attendants were admitted to a public audience of
the emperor. The three subsequent days were
employed in viewing the city the- appearance of
which, so far superior in the order of its build.
ings and the number of its inhabitants to any
place the Spaniards had beheld in America, and
yet so little resembling the firuEture of an European
city, filled them with surprise and admiration.

MExico, or fenuchtitlan, as it was anciently

called by the natives, is situated in a large plain,
environed by mountains of such height, that,
though within the torrid zone, the temperature of
its climate is mild and healthful. All the moillure
which descends from the high grounds is collected
in several lakes, the two largeIt of which, of
about ninety miles in circuit, communicate with
each other. The waters of the one are fresh, those
of the other brackish. On the banks of the latter,
and on tome small islands adjoining to them, the
capital of Montezuma's empire was built. The
accels to the city was by artificial caulleways or

streets

itreets formed of stones and earth, about thirty B 0o K
feet in breadth. As the waters of the lake during - _.
the rainy season overflowed the flat country, these "9''
causeways were of considerable length. That of
Tacuba, on the weft, extended a mile and a half;
that of Tepeaca ', on the north-west, three miles;
that of Cuoyacan, towards the south, fix miles.
On the east there was no causeway, and the city
could be approached only by canoes". In each
of these causeways were openings at proper inter-
vals, through which the waters flowed; and over
these beams of timber were laid, which being co-
vered with earth, the causeway or street had every-
where an uniform appearance. As the approaches
to the city were singular, its conftruntion was re-
markable. Not only the temples of their gods,
but the houses belonging to the monarch, and to
persons of diftinEtion, were of such dimensions,
that, in comparison with any other buildings which
had been hitherto discovered in America, they might
be termed magnificent. The habitations of the
common people were mean, resembling the huts
of other Indians. But they were all placed in a

no less unexpected than favourable to their pro-
grefs, they had been allowed to penetrate into the
heart of a powerful kingdom, and were now
lodged in its capital, without having once met
with open opposition from its monarch. The
Tlafcalans, however, had earnestly dissuaded them
from placing fiich confidence in Montezuma, as to
enter a city of such a peculiar situation as Mexico,
where that prince would have them at mercy, (hut

felled their sovereign to admit the Spaniards into
the capital, that he might cut them off there

perceived, too plainly, that the apprehensions of
their allies were not destitute of foundation; that,
by breaking the bridges placed at certain inter-
vals on the causeways, or by destroying part of the
causeways themselves, their retreat would be ren-
dered impracticable, and they must remain cooped
up in the centre of a hostile city, surrounded by
multitudes sufficient to overwhelm them, and
without a possibility of receiving aid from their
allies. Montezuma had, indeed, received them with
distinguished respect. But ought they to reckon
upon this as real, or to confider it as feigned ?

consequence of attempting the latter. The fuc-

Montezuma, whom fear alone restrained at pre-

the countenance of his own sovereign was to be
obtained only by a series of victories, and that no.
thing but the merit of extraordinary success could
screen his condut from the censure of irregula-

narch in a tone very different from that which he
had employed in former conferences, reproaching
him bitterly as the author of the violent aflault

they had sustained by the death of some of their
companions, as well as for the insult offered to
the great prince whose servants they were. Mon-

which he was treated, afterted his own innocnce

orders instantly to bring Q(ialpop)oca anld lis ac-

complices prisoners to Mexico. Cortes replied, B o oK
with seeming complaifiance, that a declaration so '
refpetable left no doubt remaining in his own *L9'
mind, but that something more was requisite to
satisfy his followers, who would never be con-
vinced that Montezuma did not harbour hostile
intentions against them, unless, as an evidence of
his confidence and attachment, he removed from
his own palace, and took up his residence in the
Spanish quarters, where he should be served and
honoured as became a great monarch. The firfi
mention of so strange a proposal bereaved Monte-
zuma of speech, and almost of motion. At length,
indignation gave him utterance, and he haughtily
answered, " That persons of his rank were not
accustomed voluntarily to give up themselves as
prisoners; and were he mean enough to do so, his
fubjeas would not permit such an affront to be
offered to their sovereign." Cortes, unwilling to
employ force, endeavoured alternately to soothe
and to intimidate him. The altercation became
warm ; and having continued above three hours,
Velasquez de Leon, an impetuous and gallant
young man, exclaimed with impatience, " Why
waste more time in vain ? Let us either seize him
instantly, or stab him to the heart." The threat-
ening voice and fierce gestures with which there
words were uttered, struck Montezuma. The
Spaniards, he was sensible, had '6w proceeded so
far, as left him no hope that they would recede.

carried on every funtion of government as if he
had been at perfec liberty. The Spaniards, how-
ever, watched him with the scrupulous vigilance
which was natural in guarding such an important
prize d, endeavouring at the fame time to sooth
and reconcile him to his fictation, by every exter-
nal demonfiration of regard and attachment. But
from captive princes the hour of humiliation and
suffering is never far distant. Qualpopoca, his sujecaed to

under him, were brought prisoners to the capital,
in consequence of the orders which Montezuma qnc. ,
had issued. The emperor gave them up to Cortes,
that he might enquire into the nature of their
crime, and determine their punishment. They
were formally tried by a Spanish court-martial;
and though they had aEted no other part than what
became loyal fubjeats and brave men, in obeying
the orders of their lawful sovereign, and in oppo-
sing the invaders of their country, they were

unhappy vi6tinms were inflantly led forth. The
pile on which they were laid was composed of the
weapons collected in the royal magazine for the
public defence. An innumerable multitude of
Mexicans beheld, in silent astonishment, the double
insult offered to the majesty of their empire, an
officer of diffinction committed to the flames
by the authority of strangers, for having done
what he owed in duty to his natural sovereign;
and the arms provided by the foresight of their an-
ceftors for avenging public wrongs, consumed be-
fore their eyes.

BUT there were noithe most shocking indignities

which the Mexicans had to bear. The Spaniards,
convinced that Qualpopoca would not have ven-
tured to attack Efcalante without orders from his
master, were not satisfied with inflicting vengeance
on the instrument employed in committing that
crime, while the author of it escaped with impu-
nity. Just before Qualpopoca was led out to
susser, Cortes entered the apartment of Montezu.

carrying a pair of fetters; and approaching the

the cause of the outrage committed, it was nece

tha

that guilt; then turning away abruptly, without B o o K
waiting for a reply, commanded the soldier to clap I.
the fetters on his legs. The orders were instantly s5'9
executed. The disconsolate monarch, trained up
with an idea that his person was sacred and invio-
lable, and confidering this profanation of it as the
prelude of immediate death, broke out into loud
lamentations and complaints. His attendants,
speechless with horror, fell at his feet, bathing
them with their tears; and bearing up the fetters
in their hands, endeavoured with officious tender-
ness to lighten their pressure. Nor did their grief
and defpondency.abate, until Cortes returned from
the execution, and with a cheerful countenance
ordered the fetters to be taken off. As Montezu-
ma's spirits had funk with unmanly deje6tion, they
now rose into indecent joy; and with an unbecom-
ing transition, he passed at once from the anguish
ofdefpair to tranlports of gratitude and expreflions
of fondness towards his deliverer,

v_ -_ him, seems to be a display of power no less incon-

relation, no account can be given either of the one
action or the other, but that Cortes, intoxicated
with success, and presuming on the ascendant
which he had acquired over the minds of the Mexi-
cans, thought nothing too bold for him to under-
take, or too dangerous to execute. But, in one
view, these proceedings, however repugnant to
justice and humanity, may have flowed from that
artful policy which regulated every part of Cortes's
behaviour towards the Mexicans. They had con.
ceived the Spaniards to be an order of beings fupe.
rior to men. It was of the uttnoft consequence to
cherish this illusion, and tokeep up the veneration
which it inspired. Cortes wished that shedding the
blood of a Spaniard should be deemed the most hei-
nous of all crimes; and nothing appeared better cal-
culated to establish this opinion, than to condemn
the first Mexicans who had ventured to commit it,
to a cruel death, and to oblige their monarch him-
self to submit to a mortifying indignity, as an ex-
piation for being accessary to a deed so atrocious'.

subdued. During fix months that Cortes remained _- _
in Mexico, the monarch continued in the Spanish
quarters, with an appearance of as entire fatisfac-
tion and tranquillity, as if he had resided there, not
from constraint, but through choice. His mini-
fters and officers attended him as usual. He took
cognizance of all affairs; every order was issued
in his name. The external afpe6 of government
appearing the fame, and all its ancient forms being
scrupulously observed, the people were so little
sensible of any change, that they obeyed the man-
dates of their monarch with the fame submissive re.
verence as ever. Such was the dread which both
Montezuma and his fubjeEts had of the Spaniards,
or such the veneration in which they held them,
that no attempt was made to deliver their sovereign
from confinement; and though Cortes, relying on
this ascendant which he had acquired over their
minds, permitted him not only to visit his temples,'
but to make hunting excursions beyond the lake,
a guard of a few Spaniards carried with it such a
terror as to intimidate the multitude, and secure
the captive monarch f.

THUS, by the fortunate temerity of Cortes in
sizing Montezuma, the Spaniards at once secured
to themselves more extensive authority in the Mexi-
can empire than it was poflible to have acquired
in a long course of time by open force; and they

the provinces, viewed their foil and productions,
surveyed with particular care the diftriEts which
yielded gold or silver, pitched upon several places
as proper flations for future colonies, and endea-

ONE thing frill was. wanting to complete his fe.

lake as might ensure a retreat, if, either from le-
vity or disgust, the Mexicans should take arms
against him, and break down the bridges or cause-
ways. This, too, his own address, and. the faci-
lity of Montezuma, enabled him to accomplifi.
Having frequently entertained his prisoner with
pompous accounts of the European marine and art
of navigation, he awakened his curiosity to fee
those moving palaces which made their way
through the water without oars. Under pretext
of gratifying this desire, Cortes persuaded Mon-
tezuma to appoint some of his fubjeds to fetch part
of the naval. stores which the Spaniards had deposit-
ed at Vera Cruz to Mexico, and to employ others
in cutting down and preparing timber. With their
assistance, the Spanish carpenters soon completed
two brigantines, which afforded a frivolous amute-
ment to the monarch, and were confidered by Cortes
as a certain resource, if he Iould be obliged toxretire.

O O K rior, and to fubje& his dominions to the payment
< % .*» of an annual tribute. With this requisition, the

3510' last and most humbling that can be made to one

poffefled of sovereign authority, Montezuma was
so obsequious as to comply. He called together
the chief men of his empire, and in a folermn ha.
rangue, reminding then of the traditions and pro-
phecies which led them to expect the arrival of a
people sprung from the fame stock with themlelves,
in order to take poffefeion of the supreme power,
he declared his belief that the Spaniards were this
promised race; that therefore he recognized the
right of their monarch to govern the Mexican
empire; that he would lay his crown at his feet,
and obey him as a tributary. While uttering there
words, Montezuma discovered how deeply he was
affected in making such a sacrifice. Tears and
groans frequently interrupted his diliourfe. Over-
awed and broken as his spirit was, it still retained
such a sense of dignity, as to feel that pang which
pierces the heart of princes when constrained to
relign independent power. The first mention of
fich a resolution struck the assembly dumb with
astonishment. This was followed by a fullen mur-
mur of sorrow, mingled with indignation, which
indicated some violent eruption of rage to be near
at hand. This Cortes foresaw, and seasonably in-
terpofed to prevent it, by declaring that his master
had no intention to deprive Montezuma of the
royal dignity, or to make any innovation upon the
cunflitution and laws of the Mexican empire.

towards defraying the expence of fitting out the

tions, that some soldiers rejected it with fcornl
and others murmured so loudly at this cruel dif.
appointment of their hopes, that it required all the
address of Cortes, and no small exertion of his
liberality, to appease them. The complaints of
the army were not altogether destitute of founda.
tion. As the crown had contributed nothing to.
wards the equipment or success of the armament,
it was not without regret that the soldiers beheld it
sweep away so great a proportion of the treasure
purchased by their blood and toil. What fell to
the share of their general appeared, according to
the ideas of wealth in the sixteenth century, an
enormous furn. Some of Cortes's favourites had
secretly appropriated to their own use several orna
ments of gold, which neither paid the royal fifth
nor were brought into account as part of the com-
mon stock. It was, however, so manifeffly th
interest of Cortes at this period to make a larg
remittance to the king, that it is highly probabl
thole concealments were not of great consequence.

by confidering- the produ&ions of its mines in B o o i
modern times. Bur, among the ancient Mexi- .
cans, gold and silver were not the standards by 's20.
which the worth of other commodities was efti-
mated ; and destitute of the artificial value derived
from this circumstance, were no farther in request
than as they furnilhed materials for ornaments and
trinkets. These were either consecrated to the
gods in their temples, or were worn as marks of
diftinEtion by their princes and some of their mofi
eminent chiefs. As the consumption of the pre-
cious metals was inconsiderable, the demand for
them was not such as to put either the ingenuity
or industry of the Mexicans on the firetch, in or-
der to augment their store. They were altogether
unacquainted with the art of working the rich
mines with which their country abounded. What
gold they had was gathered in the beds of rivers,
native, and ripened into a pure metallic state'.
The utmost effort of their labour in search of it
was to wash the earth carried down by torrents
from the mountains, and to pick out the grains of
gold which subsided; and even this simple opera-
tion, according to the report of the persons whom
Cortes appointed to survey the provinces where
there was a prolspet of finding mines, they per-
formed verv unfkilfully k. From all those causes,

quantity of this metal was still less considerable',
Thus, though the Spaniards had exerted all the
power which they possessed in Mexico, and often
with indecent rapacity, in order to gratify their
predominant paflion, and though Montezuma had
fondly exhausted his treasures, in hopes of fa-
tiating their thirst for gold, the product of both,
which probably included a great part of the bul-
lion in the empire, did not rife in value above

Ivi rere& other matters, with respect to one point he was in-
to religion. flexible. Though Cortes often urged him, with

the importunate zeal of a miflionary, to renounce
his false gods, and to embrace the Christian faith,
he always rejected the proposition with horror.
Superstition, among the Mexicans, was formed
into such a regular and complete system, that its
institutions naturally took fast hold of the mind;
and while the rude tribes in other parts of Ame-
rica were easily induced to relinquish a few no-
tions and rites, so loose and arbitrary as hardly
to merit the name of a public religion, the Mexi-
cans adhered tenaciously to their mode of worship,

such order and solemnity as to render it the objec B o o K
of veneration. Cortes, finding all his attempts in-
effetual to fiake the constancy of Montezuma, '5s0
was- so muih enraged at his obstinacy, that in a
transport of zeal he led out his soldiers to.throw
down the idols in the great temple by force. But
the priests taking arms in defence of their altars,
and the people crowding with great ardour to sup-
port them, Cortes's prudence overruled his zeal,
and induced him to desist from his ralh attempt,
after dislodging the idols from one of the Ihrines,
and placing in their stead an image of the Virgin

Rruggle, began to meditate how they might expel

called upon to avenge their insulted deities. The
priests and leading men held fiequent consultations
with Montezuma for this purpose. But as it
might prove fatal to the captive monarch to
attempt either the one or the other by violence,
he was willing to try more gentle means. Having
called Cortes into his presence, he observed, that
now, as all the purpofcs of his embassy were fully
accomplifled, the gods had declared their will,
and the people signified their desire that he and
his followers should instantly depart out of the

tion, as well as the determined tone in which
it was uttered, left Cortes no room to doubt that
it was the result of some deep scheme concerted
between Mvonrezumaand his ftibjeds. HIe quickly
perceived that he might derive more advantage
from a feemning compliance with the monarch's in-
clination, than from an ill-timed attempt to change
or to oppose it; and replied, with great compo.
sure, that he had already begun to prepare for re-
turning to his own country; but as he had de.
t iroyed the vessels in which he arrived, some time
was requisite for building other ships. This ap-
peared reafolable. A number of Mexicans were
lent to Vera Cruz to cut down timber, and some
Spanish carpenters were appointed to superintend
the work. Cortes flattered himself, that during
this interval he might either find means to avert
the threatened danger, or receive such reinforce.
ments as would enable him to despise it.

Anxiety and ALMOST nine months were elapsed since Porto-

fpea to the future, and, by the late declaration
of Montezuma, oppressed with a new addition of
cares, a Mexican courier arrived with an account
of some ihips having appeared on the coast.
Cortes, with fond credulity, imagining that his
messengers were returned from Spain, and that the
completion of all his wishes and hopes was at
hand, imparted the glad tidings to his compa-
nions, who received them with transports of mu-
tual gratulation. Their joy was not of long
continuance. A courier from Sandoval, whom
Cortes had appointed to succeed Efcalante in com-
mand at Vera Cruz, brought certain information
that the armament was fitted out by Velasquez,
governor of Cuba, and instead of bringing the aid
which they. expected, threatened them with imme-
diate deftruftion.

THE motives which prompted Velasquez to this ftted out by
violent measure are obvious. From the circum-
lances of Cortcs's departure, it was inpolfible not

this suspicion, which was at last confirmed, be-
yond doubt, by the indiscretion of the officers
whom Cortes sent to Spain. They, from some
motive which is not clearly explained by the con-
temporary historians, touched at the island of
Cuba, contrary to the peremptory orders of their
general . By this means Velasquez not only
learned that Cortes and his followers, after for-
mally renouncing all connecion with him, had
established an independent colony in New Spain,
and were soliciting the king to confirm their pro-
ceedings by his authority ; but he obtained parti-
cular information concerning the opulence of the
country, the valuable presents which Cortes had
received, and the inviting prospects of success that
opened to his view. Every paflion which can
agitate an ambitious mind; shame, at having been
so grossly overreached; indignation, at being be-
trayed by the man whom he had fele&ed as the
object of his favour and confidence; grief, for
having wafted his fortune to aggrandize an ene-
my; and despair of recovering so fair an opportu-
nity of establishing his fame and extending his
power, now raged in the bosom of Velasquez. All
these, with united force, excited him to make an
extraordinary effort in order to be avenged on the

author of his wrongs, and to wrest from him his B o o K
slurped authority and conquests. Nor did hewant v-
the appearance of a good title to justify such an 1z
attempt. The agent whom he sent to Spain with
an account of Grijalva's voyage, had met with a
molt favourable reception; and from the fpeci-
mens which he produced, such high expectations
were formed concerning the opulence of New
Spain, that Velasquez was authoriled to prosecute
the discovery of the country, and appointtdc go-
vernor of it during life, with more extensive power
and privileges than had been granted to any ad-
venturer from the time of Columbus '. Elated by
this distinguishing mark of favour, and warranted
to confider Cortes not only as intruding upon his
jurifdiclion, but as disobedient to the royal man-
date, he determined to vindicate his own rights
and the honour of his sovereign by force of arms .

principal officers, to fend them prisoners to him,

of the country in his name.

The pro- AFTER a prosperous voyage, Narvaez landed

Three soldiers, whom Cortes had lent to search
for mines in that district, immediately joined him.
By this accident, he not only received information
concerning the progress and situation of Cortes,
but as these soldiers had made omre progress in
the knowledge of the Mexican language, he ac-
quired interpreters, by whose means he was en-
abled to hold some intercourse with the people of
the country. But, according to the low cunning
of deserters, they framed their intelligence with
more attention to what they thought would be
agreeable, than to what they knew to be true;
and represented the situation of Cortes to be so
desperate, and the difaftfedion of his followers to
be so general, as increased the natural confidence
and presumption of Narvaez. His first operation,
however, might have taught him not to rely on
their partial accounts. Having lent to fuimmon
the governor of Vera Cruz to lurl-ender, Guevara,

a pries

priest whom he employed in that service, made B o0 K
the requisition with such insolence, that Sandoval, L_-.
an officer of high spirit, and zealously attached to '51°'
Cortes, instead of complying with his demands,
seized him and his attendants, and sent them in
chains to Mexico.

CORTES received them not like enemies, but as Cortes deep
friends, and condemning the severity of Sandoval, y aar.
set them immediately at liberty. By this well-
timed clemency, seconded by carefits and pre-
sents, he gained their confidence, and drew from
them such particulars concerning the force and in-
tentions of Narvaez, as gave him a view of the
impending danger in its full extent. He had not
to contend now with half-naked Indians, no match
for him in war, and still more inferior in the arts
of policy, but to take the field against an army in
courage and martial diicipline equal to his own, in
number far superior, ating under the fanfion of
royal authority, and commanded by an officer of
known bravery. He was informed that Narvaez,
more solicitous to gratify the resentment of Velaf-
quez, than attentive to the honour or interest of
his country, had begun his intercourse with the
natives, by representing him and his followers as
fugitives and outlaws, guilty of rebellion against
their own sovereign, and of injustice in invading
the Mexican empire; and had declared tliat his
chief obje&t in visiting the country was to punish
the Spaniards who had committed these crimes,
and to rescue the Mexicans fiom oppreflion. He

means to assure him, that as the conduEt of tholi
who kept him under restraint was highly displeasing
to the king his master, he had it in charge not only
to rescue an injured monarch from confineminr,
but to reinstate him in the possession of his ancient
power and independence. Animated with this
profpeEt of being- let free from fubLjeEtion to fl'ran-
gers, the Mexicans in several provinces began open-
ly to revolt from Cortes, and to regard Narvaez as
a deliverer no lels able than willing to save themn.
Montezuma himself kept up a secret intercouilc
with the new commander, and seemed to cotur
him as a person superior in power and dignity to
those Spaniards whom he had hitherto revered a;

wrongs. If he should abandon the capital, Set the B o V K
captive monarch at liberty, and march out to meet -

all his toils and victories, and relinquish advan-
tages which could not be recovered without ex-
traordinary efforts, and infinite danger. If, in-
stead of employing force, he should have recourse
to conciliating measures, and attempt an accom-
modation with Narvaez; the natural haughtiness
of that officer, augmented by consciousness of his
present superiority, sorbad him to cherish any fan-
guine hope of success. After revolving every
Icheme with deep attention, Cortes fixed upon
that which in execution was most hazardous, bur,
if successful, would prove most beneficial to his
country; and with the decisive intrepidity suited
to desperate situations, determined to make one
bold effort for victory under every disadvantage,
rather than sacrifice his own conquests and the Spa-
nifh interest in Mexico.

not only indecent, but criminal, to have marched

adjust matters by an amicable negociation. In this
service he employed Olmedo, his chaplain, to
whose character the funRion was well uiited, and
who possessed, betides, such prudence and address,
as qualified him to carry on the fccret intrigues in
which Cortes placed his chief confidence. Narvaez

Y 4 rejeted,

B O 0 K rejeced, with scorn, every scheme of accommo-
u--... dation that Olmedo proposed, and was with diffi-

culty restrained from laying violent hands on him
and his attendants. He met, however, with a
more favourable reception among the followers of
Narvaez, to many of whom he delivered letters,
either from Cortes or his officers, their ancient
friends and companions. Cortes artfully accom-
panied there with presents of rings, chains of gold,
and other trinkets of value, which inspired those
needy adventurers with high ideas of the wealth
that he had acquired, and with envy of their good
fortune who were engaged in his service. Some,
from hopes of becoming sharers in those rich spoils,
declared for an immediate accommodation with
Cortes. Others, from public spirit, laboured to
prevent a civil war, which, whatever party should
prevail, must hake, and perhaps subvert the Spa-
nifh power, in a country where it was so imper-
fectly eflablilhed. Narvaez disregarded both, and
by a public proclamation denounced Cortes and his
adherents rebels and enemies to their country.
Cortes, it is probable, was not much surprised at
the untradcable arrogance of Narvaez; and, after
having given such a proof of his own pacific dif-
position as might justify his recourse to other means,
he determined to advance towards an enemy whom
he had laboured in vain to appease.

To the custody of this slender garrison he commit- 5
ted a great city, with all the wealth he had arnaf-
ed, and, what was still of greater importance, the
person of the imprisoned monarch. His utmost
art was employed in concealing from Montezuma
the real cause of his march. He laboured to per-
fuade him, that the firangers who had lately ar-
rived were his friends and fellow-fubje&s; and that,
after a short interview with them, they would de-
part together, and return to their own country.
The captive prince, unable to comprehend the
designs of the Spaniards, or to reconcile what he
now heard with the declarations of Narvaez, and
afraid to discover any symptom of suspicion or dif-
trust of Cortes, promised to remain quietly in the
Spanish quarters, and to cultivate the fame friend-
hip with Alvarado which he had uniformly main-
tained with him. Cortes, with teeming confidence
in this promise, but relying principally upon the
injunctions which he had given Alvarado to guard
his prisoner with the most scrupulous vigilance, set
out from Mexico.

observed that the Indians in the province of Chi.

he armed his soldiers with these, and accustomed

that ever was invented for defence, enabled them
to assume.

his opponent. But Narvaez requiring that Cortes
and his followers should instantly recognize his
title to be governor of New Spain, in virtue of the
powers which le derived from Velasquez; and
Cortes refusing to submit to any authority which
was not founded on a commifflon from the emperor
himself, under whose immediate protecion he and
his adherents had placed their infant colony; all
these attempts proved fruitless. The intercourle,
however, which this occasioned between the two
parties, proved of no small advantage to Cortes,
as it afforded him an opportunity of gaining tome
of Narvacz's officers by liberal presents, of soften-
ing others by a Iemblance of moderation, and of
dazzling all by the appearance of wealth among lis

liare of the Mexican gold into chains, bracelets,
and other ornaments, which they displayed with IlO.
military ostentation. Narvaez and a little junto of
his creatures excepted, all the army leaned towards
an accommodation with their countrymen. This
discovery of their inclination irritated his violent
temper almost to madnels. In a transport of rage,
he set a price upon the head of Cortes, and of his
principal officers; and having learned that he was
now advanced within a league of Zmnpoalla with
his finall body of men, he confidered this as an
insult which merited immediate chafliiiment, and
marched out with all his troops to offer him battle.

that he could not be attacked, 'he beheld the ap?

garded this vain bravade. It was then the begin-
ning of the wet fealbn ', and the rain had poured
down, during a great part of the day, with the
violence peculiar to the torrid zone. The follow-
ers of Narvaez, unaccustomed to the hardships of
military service, murmured to much at being thus

B 0 0 K adversary, their general permitted them to retire to

v~-v Zempoalla. The very circumrtance which induced
1520. them to quit the field, encouraged Cortes to form

a scheme, by which he hoped at once to terminate
the war. He observed, that his hardy veterans,
though (landing under the torrents, which conti-
nued to fall, without a single tent or any Ihelter
whatsoever to cover them, were so far from repin-
ing at hardthips which were become familiar to
them, that they were still fresh and alert for ser-
vice. He foresaw that the enemy would naturally
give themselves up to repose after their fatigue,
and that, judging of the condut of others by their
own effeminacy, they would deem themselves per-
fectly secure at a season so unfit for aEtion. [Ie
resolved, therefore, to fall upon them in the dead
of night, when the surprise and terror of this un-
expected attack might more than compensate the
inferiority of his numbers. His soldiers, sensible
that no resource remained but in some desperate
effort of courage, approved of the measure with
such warmth, that Cortes, in a military oration
which he addressed to them before they began their
march, was more solicitous to temper than to in-
flame their ardour. He divided them into three
parties. At the head of the first he placed Sando.
val; entrusting this gallant officer with the mofl
dangerous and important service, that of seizing
the enemy's artillery, which was planted before
the principal tower of the temple, where Narvaez
had fixed his head-quarters. Chriftoval de Olid

tower, and lay hold on the general. Cortes him- 4. J
self conduced the third and smallest divilion, 15o0'
which was to aft as a body of reserve, and to sup-
port the other two as there ihould be occasion.
Having passed the river de Canoas, which was
much swelled with the rains, not without difficul-
ty, the water reaching almost to their chins, they
advanced in profound silence, without beat of
drum, or found of any warlike instrument ; each
man armed with his sword, his dagger, and his
Chinantlan spear. Narvaez, remiss in proportion
to his security, had posted only two centinels to
watch the motions of an enemy whom he had such
good cause to dread. One of these was seized by
the advanced guard of Cortes's troops, the other
made his escape, and hurrying to the town with
all the precipitation of fear and zeal, gave such
timely notice of the enemy's approach, that there
was full leisure to have prepared for their recep-
tion. But, through the arrogance and infatuation
of Narvaez, this impornant interval was lolt. He
imputed this alarm to the cowardice of the centi-
nel, and treated with derfion the idea of being at-
iacked by forces bo unequal to his own. The
Ihouts of Cortes's soldiers, rushing on to the as-
Iault, convinced him at last, that the danger which
he despiscd was real. The rapidity with which
they advanced was fltch, that only one cannon
could be fired, before Sandoval's party closed with
the enemy, drove them from their guns, and began

to

B o o K to force their way up the steps of the tower. Nar-
A---' vaez, no less brave in action than presumptuous
1520. in conduEt, armed himself in haste, and by his

voice and example animated his men to the com-
bat. Olid advanced to fiuftain his companions;
and Cortes himself, rushing to the front, condud&.
ed and added new vigour to the attack. The
compaEt order in which this small body pressed on,
and the impenetrable front which they presented
with their long spears, bore down all opposition

nd over- before it. They had now reached the gate, and
'omesim. were struggling to burst it open, when a ioldier

having set fire to the reeds with which the tower
was covered, compelled Narvaez to sally out. In
the firtt encounter he was wounded in the eye with
a spear, and falling to the ground, was dragged
down the steps, and in a moment clapt in fetters.
The cry of victory resounded among the troops of
Cortes. Those who had sallied out with their
leader now maintained the conflict feebly, and be-
gan to surrender. Among the remainder of his
soldiers, stationed in two smaller towers of the
temple, terror and confusion prevailed. The
darknels was so great, that they could not diflin-
guih between their friends and foes. Their own
artillery was pointed against them. Wherever
they turned their eyes, they beheld lights gleaming
through the obscurity of night, which, though
proceeding only from a variety of ihining infects,
that abound in moist and sultry climates, their at-
frighted imaginations represented as numerous

two soldiers being killed on the fide of Cortes, and

like enemies, but as countrymen and friends, and
offered either to fend them back direclly to Cuba,
or to take them into his service, as partners in his
fortune, on equal terms with his own soldiers.
This latter proposition, seconded by a seasonable
distribution of some presents from Cortes, and li-
beral promises of more, opened profpets so agree-
able to the romantic expectations which had invited
them to engage in this service, that all, a few par-
tizans of Narvaez excepted, closed with it, and
vied with each other in professions of fidelity and
attachment to a general, whose recent success had
given them such a flriking proof of his abilities for
command. Thus, by a series of events no less
fortunate than uncommon, Cortes not only eicaped
from perdition which seemed inevitable, but, when
he had least reason to expeEt it, was placed at the
lhcnd of a thousand Spaniards, ready to follow
wherever he should lead them. Whoever reflects

Volt was excited by motives which rendered it still B o K
more alarming. On the departure of Cortes for v -
Zempoalla, the Mexicans flattered themselves, ;5s
that the long-expected opportunity of restoring
their sovereign to liberty, and of vindicating their
country from the odious dominion of firangers,
was at length arrived ; that while the forces of their
oppressors were divided, and the arms of one party
turned againit the other, they might triumph with
greater facility over both. Consultations were held,
and schemes formed with this intention. The Spa-
niards in Mexico, conscious of their own feeble-
ness, fufpe&ed and dreaded those machinations.
Alvarado, though a gallant officer, possessed nei-
ther that extent of capacity, nor dignity of man-
ners, by which Cortes had acquired such an ascend-
ant over the minds of the Mexicans, as never al-
lowed them to form ajuft estimate of his weakness
or of their own flrength. Alvarado knew no mode
of supporting his authority but force. Instead of
employing address to disconcert the plans or to
soothe the spirits of the Mexicans, he waited the re-
turn of one of their solemn feflivals, when the
principal persons in the empire were dancing, ac-
cording to custom, in the court of the great tem-
ple; he seized all the avenues which led to it, and,
allured partly by the rich ornaments which they
wore in honour of their gods, and partly by tha
facility of cutting off at once the authors of that
conspiracy which he dreaded, he fell upon them,
unarmed and unlufpicious of any danger, and maf-

the city, but the whole empire, with indignation
and rage. All called aloud for vengeance; and
regardless of the safety of their monarch, whose

leback tthe To him the danger appeared so imminent, as
capital. to admit neither of deliberation nor delay. He set

out infantly with all his forces, and returned from
Zempoalla with no less rapidity than he had ad.
vanced thither. At Tlafcala he was joined by two
thousand chosen warriors. On entering the Mexi-
can territories he found that difaffe&ion to the
Spaniards was not confined to the capital. The
principal inhabitants had deserted the towns through

lwhich he passed; no person of note appearing to
meet him with the usual refpeca; no provision was
made for the fubflftence of his troops; and though
he was permitted to advance without opposition,
the olitudle and silence which reigned in every
place, and the horror with which the people avoid-
ed all intercourse with him, discovered a deep-
rooted antipathy, that excited the most just alarm.
But, implacable as the enmity of the Mexicans
was, they were so unacquainted with the fcicnce

ui"

of war, that they knew not how to take the pro- B O.O K
per measures, either for their own safety or the de- L--_
firuaion of the Spaniards. Uninftruted by their 's5o.
former error in admitting a formidable enemy into
their capital, instead of breaking down the cause-
ways and bridges, by which they might have in-
closed Alvarado and his party, and have effectu-
ally flopt the career of Cortes, they again suffered Jung z4.
him to march into the city without molestation,
and to take quiet poffeflon of his ancient station.

expressed. Both parties were so much elated, the
one with their seasonable deliverance, and the other
with the great exploits which they had atchieved,
that this intoxication of success seems to have
reached Cortes himself; and he behaved on this
occasion neither with his usual sagacity nor atten-
tion. He not only negleAed to visit Montezuma,
but embittered the insult by exprefflons full of
contempt for that unfortunate prince and his peo-
ple. The forces of which he had now the com-
mand, appeared to him so irresistible, that he might
afrume an higher tone, and lay aside the maik of
moderation, under which he had hitherto conceal-
ed his designs. Some Mexicans who underflood
the Spanish language, heard the contemptuous
words which Cortes uttered, and reporting them
to their countrymen, kindled their rage anew.
They were now convinced that the intentions of

Z 2 the

B ovo K the general were equally blo6dy with those of Alv.
I-__i rado, and that his original purpose in visiting their

' country, had not been, as he pretended, to court

the alliance of their sovereign, but to attempt the

The violent conquest of his dominions. They resumed their
hofsility of
the Mxi- arms with the additional fury which this discovery
cans' inspired, attacked a confiderat- e body of Spaniards

who were marching towards the great square in
which the public market was held, and compelled
them to retire with some loss. Emboldened by
this frccefs, and delighted to find that their op.
pressors were not invincible, they advanced next
day with extraordinary martial pomp to afiault the
Spaniards in, their quarters. Their number was
formidable, and their undaunted courage still more
so. Though the artillery pointed against their nu-
merous battalions, crowded together in narrow
streets, swept off multitudes at every discharge;
though every blow of t-he Spanish weapons fell
with mortal effcft upon their naked bodies, the
impetuosity of the affaukt did not abate. Fre
men rushed forward to occupy the places of the
slain, and meeting with the fame fate, were fuc
ceeded by others no less intrepid and eager for vcn
geance. The utmof: effort of Cortes's abilitie
and experience, seconded by the disciplined valou
of his troops, were hardly fuficient to defend th
fortifications, that surrounded the post where th
Spaniards were stationed, into which the t!.'.cm
were more than once on the point of forcing tli
way.

of their new leader x. But surprise and complaints
were of no avail. Some immediate and extraordi-
nary effort was requisite to extricate themselves
out of their present situation. As soon as the ap-
proach of evening induced the Mexicans to re-
tire, in compliance with their national custom
of ceasing from hoflilities with the setting fun,
Cortes began to prepare for a sally, next day, with

B o0 K Mexicans was greatly augmented by fresh troops;

V.
L--J which poured in continually from the country, and

their animosity was in no degree abated. They
were led by their nobles, inflamed by the exhorta.
tions of their prieffs, and fought in defence of
their temples and families, under the eye of their
gods, and in presence of. their wives and children.
Notwithstanding their numbers, and enthufiaffic
contempt of danger and death, wherever the
Spaniards could close with them, the superiority
of their discipline and arms obliged the Mexi-
cans to give way. But in narrow streets, and
where many of the bridges of communication
were broken down, the Spaniards could seldom
come to a fair rencounter with the enemy, and as
they advanced, were exposed to showers of arrows
and stones from the tops of the houses. After
a day of incessant exertion, though vast numbers
of the Mexicans fell, and part of the city was
burnt, the Spaniards, weary with the slaughter,
and harassed by multitudes which fucceflively re-
lieved each other, were obliged at length to retire,
with the mortification of having accomplished no-
thing so decisive as to compensate the unusual cala-
mity of having twelve soldiers killed, and above
sixty wounded. Another rally, made with greater
force, was not more effectual, and in it the general
himlfelf was wounded in the hand.

Ifnntezuma CORTES now perceived, too late, the fatal er-

ror into which he had been betrayed by his own

contempt of the Mexicans, and was satisfied that B o o K
he could neither maintain his present ifation in the _--
centre of an hostile city, nor retire from it without
the most imminent danger. One resource frill re-
mained, to try what effect the interposition of
Montezuma might have to soothe or overawe his
fubjetcs. When the Mexicans approached next
morning to renew the assault, that unfortunate
prince, at the mercy of the Spaniards, and reduced
to the fad necessity of becoming the instrument of
his own disgrace, and of the slavery of his people y,
advanced to the battlements. in his royal robes, and
with all the pomp in which he used to appear on
solemn occasions. At fight of their sovereign,
whom they had long been accustomed to honour,
and almost to revere as a god, the weapons dropt
from their hands, every tongue was silent, all
bowed their heads, and many prostrated themselves
on the ground. Montezuma addressed them with
every argument that could mitigate their rage, or
persuade them to cease from hostilities. When he
ended his discourse, a fullen murmur of difappro-
bation run through the ranks; to this succeeded
reproaches and threats; and the fury of the mul-
titude rising in a moment above every restraint ot
decency or refped, flights of arrows and volleys of
flones poured in lo violently upon the ramparts,
that before the Spanish soldiers, appointed to co-
ver Montezuma with their bucklers, had time to

fall, the Mexicans were so much astonished, that,
with a transition not uncommon in popular tu-
mults, they pafled in a moment from one extreme
to the other, remorse succeeded to insult, and they
fled with horror, as if the vengeance of Heaven
were pursuing the crime which they had com.
mitted. The Spaniards, without moleRfation, car-
ried Montezuma to his apartments, and Cortes
hastened thither to console him under his misfor-
tune. But the unhappy monarch now perceived
how low he was funk, and the haughty spirit
which feerned to have been so long extinct, re-
turning, he scorned to survive this last humiliation,
and to protra& an ignominious life, not only as
the prisoner and tool of his enemies, but as the
obje.t of contempt or detestation among his sub-
jets. In a transport of rage he tore the bandages
from his wounds, and refused, with such obfti.
nacy, to take any nourishment, that he soon ended
his wretched days, rejecting with disdain all the
solicitations of the Spaniards to embrace the Chrilt-
ian faith.

ew, con. UPON the death of Montezuma, Cortes having
tlats. loft all hope of bringing the Mexicans to an ac-

conmmodation, saw no profpedc of tafety but in at-
*tempting a retreat, and began to prepare for it.
But a fuddcn motion of the Mexicans engaged

him

him in new conflics. They took poffeflion of a B o o ,.
high tower in the great temple which overlooked -v--.
the Spanish quarters, and placing there a garrison 2$*
of their principal warriors, not a Spaniard could
stir without being exposed to their miflile weapons.
From this polt it was necessary to dislodge them
at any risk; and Juan de Efcobar, with a nume-
rous detachment of chosen soldiers, was ordered to
make the attack. But Efcobar, though a gallant
officer, and at the head of troops accustomed
to conquer, and who now fought under the eyes
of their countrymen, was thrice repulsed. Cortes,
sensible that not only the reputation, but the safety
of his army depended on the success of this assault,
ordered a buckler to be tied to his arm, as he
could not manage it with his wounded hand, and
ruffed with his drawn sword into the thickest of
the combatants. Encouraged by the pretence of
their general, the Spaniards returned to the charge
with such vigour, that they gradually forced their
way up the steps, and drove the Mexicans to the
platform at the top of the tower. There a dread-
ful carnage began, when two young Mexicans of
high rank, observing Cortes as he animated his
soldiers by his voice and example, resolved to fa-
crifice their own lives in order to cut off the au-
thor of all the calamities which desolated their
country. They approached him in a supplicant
posture, as if they had intended to lay down their
arms, and seizing him in a moment, hurried him
towards the battlements, over. which they threw

matters of the tower, they set fire to it, and, with.

Tl.e Spa- THIS became the more necessary, as the Mexi-

whole system of hostility, and instead of incessant
attacks, endeavoured, by barricading the fireets,
and breaking down the causeways, to cut off the
communication of the Spaniards with the continent,
and thus to starve an enemy whom they could not
subdue. The first point to be determined by Cor.
tes and his followers, was, whether they should
march out openly in the face of day, when they
could discern every danger, and fee how to regu-
late their own motions, as well as how to refill the
assaults of the enemy; or, whether they ihould en,

deavour

'deavour to retire secretly in the night ? The latter B oo oK
was preferred, partly from hopes that their national L-. _
superstition would restrain the Mexicans from ven- S
turing to attack them in the night, and partly
from their own fond belief in the predictions of a
private soldier, who having acquired universal
credit by a smattering of learning, and his preten-
sions to astrology, boldly assured his countrymen
of success, if they made their retreat in this man-
ner. They began to move, towards midnight, in
three divisions. Sandoval led the van; 'cdro Al-
varado, and Velasquez de Leon, had the conduct
of the rear ; and Cortes commanded in the centre,
where he placed the prisoners, among whom were
a son and two daughters of Montezuma, together
with several Mexicans of diftindion, the artillery,
the baggage, and a portable bridge of timber, in-
tended to be laid over the breaches in the causeway.
They marched in profound silence along the cause-
way which led to Tacuba, becaule it was shorter
than any of the reft, and lying most remote from
the road towards Tlafcala and the sea-coast, had been
left more entire by the Mexicans. They reached
the first breach in it without molestation, hoping
that their retreat was undiscovered.

BUT the Mexicans, unperceived, had not only Attacked

made proper dispositions for a most formidable at-
tack. While the Spaniards were intent upon pla-
cing their bridge in the breach, and occupied in
conducting their horses and artillery along it, they

B QVO K rwere suddenly ,armied. with the tremendqus found
.V-'-u' of warlike inftrumnens, and a general 'hout from

an innumerable multitude of enemies; the lake was
covered with canoes ,: flights of arrows, and show-
ers of flones poured in upon therm from every
quarter; the Mexicans ruibing forward to the
charge with fearless impetuosity, as if they hoped
in that moment to be avenged for all their wrongs.
Unfortunately the wooden-bridge, by the weight
of the artillery, was wedged so fast into the stones
and mnud, that it was impossible to remove it.
Dismayed at this accident, the Spaniards advanced
with precipitation towards the second breach.
The Mexicans hemmed them in on every fide, and
though they defended themselves with their usual
courage, yet crouded together as they were on a
narrow causeway, their discipline and military skill
-were of little avail, nor did the obscurity of the
night permit them to derive great advantage from
their fire-arms, or the superiority of their other
weapons. All Mexico was now in arms, and lb
eager were the people on the deftruEtion of their
oppretors, that they who were not near enough
to annoy them in perobn, impatient of the delay,
prefled forward with fuich ardour, as drove on their
rcountrymen in the front with irresistible violence.
Frefli warriors inflantly filled the place of such as
fell. The Spaniards, weary with slaughter, and
unable to lfutain the weight of the torrent that
poured in upon them, began to give way. In a mo-
nment the confusion was univlrral ; horse and for,

CORTES, with about a hundred foot soldiers and Their dit.

a few horse, forced his way over the two remain-
ing breaches in the causeway, the bodies of the
dead serving to fill up the charms, and reached the
main land. Having formed them as soon as they
arrived, he returned with such as were yet capa-
ble of service, to assist his friends in their retreat,
and to encourage them, by his presence and ex-
ample, to persevere in the efforts requisite to effect
it. He met with part of his soldiers, who had
broke through the enemy, but found many more
overwhelmed by the multitude of their aggressors,
or perishing in the lake; and heard the piteous la-
mentations of others, whom the Mexicans, having
taken alive, were carrying off in triumph to be
sacrificed to the god of war. Before day, all who
had escaped assembled at Tacuba. BLlt when the
morning dawned, and discovered to the view of
Cortes his hattered battalion, reduced to less than
half its number, the survivors dejeEted, and molt

who having forsaken the party of his kinfinan, the
governor of Cuba, to follow the fortune of his
companions, was, on that account, as well as for
his superior merit, refpeaed by them as the second
person in the army. All the artillery, ammuni-
tion, and baggage, were loft; the greater part of
the horses, and above two thousand Tlafcalans,
were killed, and only a very small portion of the
treasure which they had amassed was saved. This,
which had been always their chief object, proved
a great cause of their calamity; for many of the
soldiers having so overloaded themselves with bars
of gold as rendered them unfit for aEtion, and re-
tarded their flight, fell, ignominiously, the victims
of their own inconsiderate avarice. Amidst so
many disasters, it was some consolation to find that

id them on every fide, and the people of Tacuba B o o K
began to take arms, he could not continue in his ..--.
present station. He direced his march towards
the rising ground, and having fortunately disco-
vered a temple situated on an eminence, took pof-
feflion of it. There he found not only the shelter
for which he wished, but, what was no less wanted,
some provisions to refresh his men; and though
the enemy did not intermit their attacks through-
out the day, they were with less difficulty prevent-
ed from making any impression. During this time
Cortes was engaged in deep consultation with his
officers, concerning the route which they ought to
take in their retreat. They were now on the weft
fide of the lake. Tlafcala, the only place where
they could hope for a friendly reception, lay about
fixty-four miles to the east of Mexicoc; so that
they were obliged to go round the north end of the
lake before they could fall into the road which
led thither. A Tlafcalan soldier undertook to be
their guide, and conducted them through a coun-
try in some places marfly, in others mountainous,
in all ill-culivated and thinly peopled. They
marched for fix days with little respite, and under
continual alarms, numerous bodies of the Mexi-
cans hovering around them, sometimes harafling
them at a distance with their miflile weapons, and
sometimes attacking them clofcly in front, in rear,
in flank, with great boldness, as they now knew

B oo o i that they were not invincible. Nor were the fa.
a-__s-
- tigue and danger of those incessant conflics the

*50' woflt evils to which they were exposed. As the

barren country through which they passed afforded
hardly any provisions, they were reduced to feed
on berries, roots, and the stalks of green maizei
and at the very time that famine was deprefling
their spirits and aftirng their ftiength, their fitua.
tion required the most vigorous and unremitting
exertions of courage and aEtivity. Amidst those
complicated difreffes, one circumstance supported
and animated the Spaniards. Their commander
sustained this fad reverse of fortune with unshaken
magnanimity. His pretence of mind never forsook
him; his sagacity foresaw every event, and his vi.
gilance provided for it. He was foremost in every
danger, and endured every hardship with cheer-
fulness. The difficulties with which he was fur.
rounded seemed to call forth new talents; and his
soldiers, though despairing therrifelves, continued
to follow him with encreafing confidence in his
abilities.
oattle of ON the sixth day they arrived near to Otumba

umba. not far from the road between Mexico and Tlaf

cala. Early next morning they began to advanc
towards it, flying parties of the enemy still hang
ing on their rear; and, amidst the insults with whic
they accompanied their hostilities, Marina remark
ed that they often exclaimed with exultation, " G
on, robbers; go to the place where you fial

33 quickl

quickly meet the vengeance due to your crimes.' B o o ii
The meaning of this threat the Spaniards did not -
comprehend, until they reached the summit of
an eminence before them. There a spacious valley
opened to their view, covered with a vast army,
extending as far as the eye could reach. The
Mexicans, while with one body of their troops
they harafled the Spaniards in their retreat, had
assembled their principal force on the other itde of
the lake; and marching along the road which led
directly to Tlafcala, posted it in the plain of Otum-
ba, through which they knew Cortes mufft pass.
At the, fight of this incredible multitude, which
they could survey at once from the rising ground,
the Spaniards were astonished, and even the boldest
began to despair. But Cortes, without allowing
leisure for their fears to acquire strength by reflec-
tion, after warning them briefly that no alternative
now remained but to conquer or to die, led them
instantly to the charge. The Mexicans waited
their approach with unusual fortitude. Such,
however, was the superiority of the Spanish dif-
cipline and arms, that the impreltion of this filall
body was irresistible; and whichever way its force
was directed, it penetrated and dispersed the mofi:
numerous battalions. But while there gave way
in one quarter, new combatants advanced from
another, and the Spaniards, though successful in
evdry attack, were ready to fink under those re-
peated efforts, without feeing any end of their toil,
or any hope of victory. At that time Cortes ob-

every thing before it. A chosen body of nobles,
who guarded the standard, made some refiltance,
but were ioon broken. Cortes, with a stroke of
his lance, wounded the Mexican general, and
threw him to the ground. One of the Spanish of-
ficers alighting, put an end to his life, and laid
hold of the imperial flandard. The moment that
their leader fell, and the standard, towards which
all directed their eyes, disappeared, an univerlal
panic struck the Mexicans, and, as if the bond
which held them together had been dissolved,
every ensign was.lowered, each soldier threw away
his weapons, and all fled with precipitation to the
mountains. The Spaniards, unable to pursue them
far, returned to colltc& the tfoils of the field,
which were so valuable, as to be obme compensation
for the wealth which they had loft in Mexico; for
in the enemy's army were most of their principal
warriors, drcirid out in their richest ornaments, as
if they had been marching to aflired victory. Next

with from allies, to whom they returned in a con-
dition very different from that in which they had
lately let out from their dominions. Happily for
them, the enmity of the Tlafcalans to the Mexi-
can name was so inveterate, their desire to avenge
the death of their countrymen so vehement, and
the ascendant which Cortes had acquired over the
chiefs of the republic so complete, that, far from
entertaining a thought of taking any advantage of
the distressed situation in which they beheld the
Spaniards, they received them with a tenderness
and cordiality which quickly difilpated all their ful-
picions.

in order to recruit their strength, exhausted by
such a long succession of fatigue and harcdlhips.
During this, Cortes learned that he and his com-
panions were n6t the only Spaniards who had felt
the effees of the Mexican enmity. A considerable
detachment, which was marching fromr Zempo-
alla towards the capital, had been cut off by the
people of Tepeaca. A frraller party, retuilrnig

junEture when the life of every Spaniard was ot
importance, such lofIes were deeply felt. The
schemes which Cortes was meditating rendered
them peculiarly afflictive to him. While his ene-
mies, and even many of his own followers, conli-
dered the disasters which had befallen him as fatal
to the progress of his arms, and imagined that
nothing now remained but speedily to abandon a
country which he had invaded with unequal force,
his mind, as eminent for perseverance as for en-
terprife, was still bent on accomplishing his origi-
nal purpose, of fubjeting the Mexican empire to
the crown of Castile. Severe and unexpeted as
the check was which he had received, it did not
appear to him a sufficient reason for relinquifling
the conquests which he had already made, or
against resuming his operations with better hopes
of success. The colony at Vera Cruz was not
only safe, but had remained unmolested. The
-people of Zempoalla and the adjacent diltrics
had discovered no fymproms of defection. The
Tlafcalans continued faithful to their alliance. On
their martial spirit, easily rouzed to arms, and in.
:flamed with implacable hatred of the Mexicans,
Cortes depended for powerful aid. He had fill
the command of a body of Spaniards, equal in
number to that with which he had opened his way
into the centre of the empire, and had taken pof
feflion of the capital; so that with the benefit 0

re'ater experience, as well as more perfect know- B 0 0 I
ledge of the country, he did not despair of quickly -A
recovering all that he had been deprived of by un- 15'.
toward events.

FULL of this idea, he courted the TlaCcalan The Tea-

chiefs with such attention, and distributed among takes.
them so liberally the rich spoils of Otumba, that he
was secure of obtaining whatever he should require
of the republic. He drew a small supply of am-
munition, and two or three field-pieces, from his
flores at Vera Cruz. He dispatched an officer of
confidence with four ihips of Narvaez's fleet to
Hispaniola and Jamaica, to engage adventurers,
and to purchase horses, gunpowder, and other
military stores. As he knew that it would be vain
to attempt the reduction of Mexico, unless he
could secure the command of the lake, he gave
orders to prepare, in the rfountains of Tlafcala,
materials for building twelve brigantines, so as they
might be carried thither in pieces ready to be put
together, and launched when he flood in need of

A -'- planters rather than soldiers, and had accompanied

ing fettlcments, but with little inclination to en-
gage in the hardships and dangers of war. As the
fame motives had induced them to enter into their
new engagements with Cortes, they no sooner be-
came acquainted with the nature of the service,
than they bitterly repented of their choice. Such
of them as had the good fortune to survive the
.perilous adventures in which their own imprudence
had involved them, happy in having made their
escape, trembled at the thoughts of being exposed
a second time to similar calamities. As soon as
they discovered the intention of Cortes, they began
fccretly to murmur and cabal, and waxing gra-
dually more audacious, they, in a body, offered
a remonstrance to their general against the impru-
dence of attacking a powerful empire with his
shattered forces, and formally required him to
lead them back diretly to Cuba. Though Cortes,
long pratiled in the arts of command, employed
arguments, intreaties, and presents, to convince
or to soothe them ; though his own soldiers, ani-
mated with the spirit of their leader, warmly fe-
r# conded his endeavours he found their fears too

yiolent and deep-rooted to be removed, and the
utnloft he couLl effe& was to prevail with them to
defer their departure for some time, on a promise
that he would, at a more proper junture, difmnifs
such as ihould desire it.

He proposed to chastise the people of Tepeaca for revive their
the outrage which they had committed, and as
the detachment which they had cut off happened
to be composed mostly of soldiers who had served
under Narvaez, their companions, from the
desire of vengeance, engaged more willingly in
this war. He took the command in person, ac- Augui.
companied by a numerous body of Tlafcalans,
and in the space of a few weeks, after various en-
counters, with great slaughter of the Tepeacans,
reduced that province to fubje&ion. During fe-
veral months, while he waited for the supplies of
men and ammunition which he expected, and was
carrying on his preparations for conftru&ting the
brigantines, he kept his troops con2tantly employ-
ed in various expeditions against the adjacent pro-
vinces, all of which were conducted with an uni-
form tenor of success. By these, his men became
again accustomed to victory, and resumed their
wonted sense of Superiority ; the Mexican power
was weakened; the Tlafcalan warriors acquired
the habit of acting in conjunction with the Spa-
niards; and the chiefs of the republic delighted
to fee their country enriched with the spoils of all
the people around them, and altonifhed every day
with fresh discoveries of the irrefiltible prowess of
their allies, declined no effort requirite to support
tliem.

A'a 4 ALL

Bs o o ALL those preparatory arrangements, however,

V. -,,-. though the most prudent and efficacious which the

trensgen- situation of Cortes allowed him to make, would
ed by feeral have been of little avail, without a reinforcement
"lnt"S of Spanilh soldiers. Of this he was so deeply fen.

fible, that it was the chief objeA of his thoughts
and withes; ani yet his only profpe&t of obtaining
it from the return of the officer whom he had sent
to the isles to solicit aid, was both distant and un.
certain. But what neither his own sagacity nor
power could have procured, he owed to a series of
fortub:ate and unforeseen incidents. The governor
of Cuba, to wh(,m the success of Narvaez appear-
ed an event of infallible certainty, having sent two
frpall ships after him with new inftru&ions, and a
supply of men and military stores, the officer
whom Cortes'had appointed to command on the
coast, artfully decoyed them into the harbour of
Vera Cruz, seized the vessels, and easily persuaded
the soldiers to follow the standard of a more able
leader than him whom they were delfined to join'.
Soon after, three ships of more considerable force
came into the harbour separately. These beiong-
ed to an armament fitted our by Francisco de Ga.
ray, governor of Jamaica, who, being pbffeffed
with the rage of discovery and conquest which
animated every Spaniard fettled in America, had
long aimed at intruding into some difiri&t of New
Spain, and dividing with Cortes the glory and
gain of annexing that pmpire to the crown of

Castile. They unadvisedly made their attempt on B o o K
the northern provinces, where the country was -.
poor, and the people fierce and warlike; and, after 5X'O
a cruel succession of disasters, famine compelled
them to venture into Vera Cruz, and cast them-
selves upon the mercy of their countrymen. Their oaober s.
fidelity was not proof against the splendid hopes
and promises which had seduced other adventurers,
and as if the spirit of revolt had been contagious
in New Spain, they likewise abandoned the master
whom they were bound to serve, and inlifted un-
der Cortes g. Nor was it America alone that fur-
nilhed such unexpeeted aid. A ship arrived from
Spain, freighted by some private merchants with
military flores, in hopes of a profitable market in
a country, the fame of whose opulence began to

remarkable instance of the singular felicity con-
fprcuous in many passages of Cortes's Itory, that
the two perobns chiefly instrumental in furnishing
him with those seasonable supplies, should be an
avowed enemy who aimed at his deftruaion, and
an envious rival who wished to supplant him.

Narvaez's soldiers as remained with reluctance in
his service. After their departure, he still muf-
tered five hundred and fifty infantry, of which

forty horsemen, and a train of nine field-pieces'.

avowed and inveterate enmity to the Spaniards B oVO R
would have been sufficient to gain their suffrages, t,-v--
although he had been lets distinguished for courage
and capacity. He had an immediate opportunity
of ihewing that he was worthy of their choice, by
conducting, in person, those fierce attacks which
compelled the Spaniards to abandon his capital;
and as soon as their retreat afforded him any re-
spite from aStion, he took meal'ures for prevent-
ing their return to Mexico, with prudence equal
to the spirit which he had displayed in driving
them out of it. As from the vicinity of Tlafcala,
he could not be unacquainted with the motions
and intentions of Cortes, he observed the storm
that was gathering, and began early to provide
against it. He repaired what the Spaniards had
ruined in the city, and strengthened it with such
new fortifications as the skill of his fubjescs was
capable of ereaing. Betide filling his magazines
with the usual weapons of war, he gave directions
to make long spears headed with the swords and
daggers taken from the Spaniards, in order to an-
noy the cavalry. He summoned the people in
every province of the empire to take arms against
their oppressors, and as an encouragement to ex-
ert themlllves with vigour, he promilc:d them ex-
emption from all the taxes which his predecessors
had imposcd 1. But what he laboured with the
greatest carncflnefs was, to deprive the Spaniards

of

B O o K of the advantages which they derived from the
v-_-_- friendship of the Tlafcalans, by endeavouring to

I520. persuade that people to renounce all connection

with men, who were not only avowed enemies of
the gods whom they worshipped, but who would
not fail to subjet them at last to the fame yoke,
which they were now inconsiderately lending their
aid to impole upon others. These representations,
no less striking than well founded, were urged so
forcibly by his ambafiadors, that it required all the
address of Cortes to prevent their making a dan-
gerous imprcfflon ".

BUT while Quetlavaca was arranging his plan

of defence, with a degree of foresight uncommon
in an American, his days were cut 1hort by the
small-pox. This distemper, which raged at that
time in New Spain with fatal malignity, was un-
known in that quarter of the globe, until it was
introduced by the Europeans, and may be reckon-
ed among the greatest calamities brought upon
them by their invaders. In his flead the Mexicans
railed to the throne Guatimozin, nephew and son-
in-law of Montezuma, a young man of such high
reputation for abilities and valour, that in this dan-
gerous crisis, his countrymen, with one voice, call-
ed him to the supreme command ".

As

As soon as Cortes entered the enemy's territories, nB o o K

he discovered various preparations to obftrutd his -. ~
progress. But his troops forced their way with or,' -
little difficulty, and took pofeffion of Tezeuco, Wands,M^i-
the second city of the empire, situated on the c'
banks of the lake about twenty miles from Mexi-
co0. Here he determined to eftablilf his head-
quarters, as the most proper station for launching
his brigantines, as well as for making his approaches
to the capital. In order to render his residence
there more secure, he deposed the cazique or chief,
who was at the head of that community, under
pretext of some defea in his title, and fubftirured
in his place a perlon whom a faction of the nobles
pointed out as the right heir of that dignity. At-
tached to him by this benefit, the new cazique
aid his adherents fcrved the Spaniards with invio-
lable fidelity P.

As the preparations for conftruEting the brigan- Hlijopere-

tines advanced slowly under the unskilful hands of :and cau-
soldiers and Indians, whom Cortes was obliged to t
employ in affifling three or four carpenters who
happened fortunately to be in his service, and as
lie had not yet received the reinforcement which
he expetced from Hispaniola, he was not in a con-
dition to turn his arms directly against the capital.

B o0 K To have attacked, at this period, a city so popu.
k-v-.J blous, so well prepared for defence, and in a fitua-

tion of flch peculiar strength, muff have exposed
his troops to inevitable deftrucdion. Three months
elapsed before the materials for the brigantines
were finished, and before he heard any thing with
refpe& to the success of the officer whom he had
sent to Hispaniola. This, however, was not a
season of inaction to Cortes. He attacked fuccef.
fively several of the towns situated around the lake;
and though all the Mexican power was exerted to
obftrut his operations, he either compelled them
to submit to the Spanish crown, or reduced them
to ruins. Other towns he endeavoured to conci-
liate by more gentle means, and though he could
not hold any intercourse with the inhabitants but
by the intervention of interpreters, yet, under all
the diiadvantage of that tedious and imperfect
mode of communication, lie had acquired 'such
thorough knowledge of the state of the country, as
well as of the dispositions of the people, that he
condluted his negociations and intrigues with
aftonilhing dexterity and success. Most of the
cities adjacent to Mexico were originally the capi-
tals of' ifall indepentdent Itates; and some of them
having been but larely annexed to the Mexican
empire, still retained the remembrance of their
ancient liberty, and bore with impatience the rigo-
rous yoke of their new matters. Cortes having
early oblerved symptoms of their clifaffectiol,
availed himnfelf of this knowledge to gain their con-

fidence

fidence and friendlhip. By offering, with confi- B'O o oK
dence, to deliver them from the odious dominion A
of the Mexicans, and by liberal promises of more ''
indulgent treatment, if they would unite with him
against their oppressors, he prevailed on the people
of several considerable diftriEts, not only to acknow-
ledge the king of Castile as their sovereign, but to
fopply the Spanish camp with provisions, and to
strengthen his army with auxiliary troops. Guati-
mozin, on the first appearance of defeEtion among
his fubjeEts, exerted himself with vigour to pre-
vent or to punish their revolt; but in spite of his
efforts, the spirit continued to spread. The Spa-
niards gradually acquired new allies, and with
deep concern he beheld Cortes arming against his
empire those very hands which ought to have been
a&ive in its defence; and ready to advance against
the capital at the head of a numerous body of his
own fubjeats q.

WHI-LE, by those various methods, Cortes was
gradually circumscribing the Mexican power within
fich narrow limits that his prolpeft of overturning
it seemed neither to be uncertain nor rer.lore, all
his schemes were 'well nigh defeated, by a con-
fpiracy no lets unexpected than dangerous. The
soldiers of Narvaez had never united perfeEtly with

were apt to fink; and now, on a near view of what
they had to encounter, in attempting to reduce a
city so inaccelfible as Mexico, and defended by a
numerous army, the resolution even of those among
them who had adhered to Cortes when he was de-
ferted by their associates, began to fail. Their fears
led them to presumptuous and unfoldier-like dif
cuffions concerning the propriety of their general's
measures, and the improbability of their success,
From there they proceeded to censure and invec-
tives, and at last began to deliberate how they
might provide for their own safety, of which they
deemed their commander to be totally negligent,
Antonio Villefagna, a private soldier, but bold,
intriguing, and frongly attached to Velasquez,
artfully fomented this growing spirit of difaffecion.
His quarters became the rendezvous of the ma!-
contents, where, after many consultations, they
* could discover no method of checking Cortes in

his career, but by assassinating him and his moll
considerable officers, and conferring the command
upon some perlbn who would relinquish his wild
plans, and adopt measures more confitent with
the general security. Despair inspired them with
courage. The hour for perpetrating the crime,
the persons whom they deflined as victims, the
officers to succeed them in command, were all
named; and the conspirators signed an association,

j6 by

by which they bound themselves with most solemn B o O K
oaths to mutual fidelity. But on the evening be- --
fore the appointed day, one of Cortes's ancient 151.
followers, who had been seduced into the confpi-
racy, touched with compunction at the imminent
danger of a man whom he had long been accuf-
tomed to revere, or struck with horror at his own
treachery, went privately to his general, and re-
vealed to him all that he knew. Cortes, though
deeply alarmed, discerned at once what conduct
was proper in a situation so critical. He repaired
instantly to Villefagna's quarters, accompanied by
some of his most trusty officers. The astonish-
ment and confusion of the man at this unexpected
visit anticipated the confefion of his guilt. Cortes,
while his attendants seized the traitor, snatched
from his bosom a paper containing the association,
signed by the conspirators. Impatient to know
how far the defection extended, he retired to read
it, and found there names which filled him with
surprise and sorrow. But, aware how dangerous
a frit scrutiny might prove at such a juncture, he
confined his judicial inquiries to Villefagna alone.
As the proofs of his guilt were manifest, he was
condemned after a short trial, and next morning
he was seen hanging before the door of the house
in which he had lodged. Cortes called his troops
together, and having explained to them the atro-
cious purpose of the conspirators, as well as the
justice of the puniihment infliited on Villefagna,
he added, with an appearance of fatisfadtion, that

diers, fifteen horsemen, and two field-pieces, he B o o K
gave to Snsdoval, who, by the vigilance, ativity, i ---
and courage which he manifested on every occa- 5
lion, was growing daily in his confidence, and in
the estimation of his fellow-foldiers. The service
was no less singular than important; the beams,
the planks, the malts, the cordage, the fails, the
iron-work, and all the infinite variety of articles
requisite for the conftruation of thirteen brigantines,
were to be carried sixty miles over land, through a
mountainous country, by people who were unac-
quainted with the ministry of domestic animals, or
the aid of machines to facilitate any work of la-
bour. The Tiafcalans furnished eight thousand
famenes, an inferior'order of men destined for ser-
vile talks, to carry the materials on their fhoul-
ders, and appointed fifteen thousand warriors to
accompany and defend them. Sandoval made the
disposition for their progress with great propriety,
placing the Tamenes in the centre, one body of
warriors in the front, another in the rear, with
considerable parties to cover the flanks. To each
of there he joined some Spaniards, not only to all
silt them in danger, but to accustom them to re-
gularity and subordination. A body so numerous,
and so much encumbered, advanced leisurely, but
in excellent order; and in some places, where it
was confined by the .woods or mo.untains, the line
of march extended above fix miles. Parties of
Mexicans frequently appeared hovering around
them on the high grounds; but perceiving no

convoy on which all the future operations of his
countrymen depended '.
a Reein- THIS was followed by another event of no less

olcemet moment. Four fiips arrived at Vera Cruz from

Hispaniola, with two hundred soldiers, eighty
horses, two battering cannon, and a considerable
supply of ammunition and arms '. Elevated with
observing that all his preparatory schemes, either
for recruiting his own army, or impairing the force
of the enemy, had now produced their full effect,
Cortes, impatient to begin the siege in form, ha-l
tened the launching of the brigantines. To fa-
cilitate this, he had employed a vast number of
Indians for two months in deepening the small ri-
vulet which runs by Tezeuco into the lake, and
in forming it into a canal near two miles in length";
and though the Mexicans, aware of his intentions,
as well as of the danger which threatened them,
endeavoured frequently to interrupt the labourers,
or to burn the brigantines, the work was at last

and with extraordinary military pomp, heightened B oo K
and rendered more solemn by the celebration of -
the most sacred rites of religion, the brigantines
were launched. As they fell down the canal in
order, Father Olmedo blessed them, and gave
each its name. Every eye followed them with
wonder and hope, until they entered the lake,
when they hoisted their fails, and bore away before
the wind. A general shout of joy was raised; all
admiring that bold inventive genius, which, by
means so extraordinary that their success almost
exceeded belief, had acquired the command of a
fleet, without the aid of which Mexico would
have continued to set the Spanish power and arms
at defiance Y.

CORTES determined to attack the city from Dispositions

three different quarters; from Tepeaca on the for the siege
north fide of the lake, from Tacuba on the weft,
and from Cuyocan towards the south. Those
towns were situated on the principal causeways
which led to the capital, and intended for their
defence. He appointed Sandoval to command in
the first, Pedro de Alvarado in the second, and
Chriftoval de Olid in the third; allotting to each
a numerous body of Indian auxiliaries, together
with an equal division of Spaniards, who, by the
junction of the troops from Hispaniola, amounted
now to eighty-fix horfemcn, and eight hundred

landmen, hardly poffiTeed of ikill enough to con- '51'
duct them, they must have been objects of terror
to a people unacquainted with any navigation but
that of their lake, and pQofeffed of no vessel larger
than a canoe. Necessity, however, urged Guati-
mozin to hazard the attack; and hoping to supply
by numbers what he wanted in force, he afembled
such a multitude of canoes as covered the face of
the lake. They rowed on boldly to the charge,
while the brigantines, retarded by a dead calm,
could scarcely advance to meet them. But as the Repuifed.
enemy drew near, a breeze suddenly sprung up;
in a moment the fails were spread, the brigantines,
with the utmost ease, broke through their feeble
opponents, overset many canoes, and dissipated
the whole armament with such slaughter, as con-
vinced the Mexicans, that the progress of the Eu-
ropeans in knowledge and arts rendered their tupe-
riority greater on this new element, than they had
hitherto found it by land b.

FROM that time Cortes remained master of the Singular

plan of con-

communication between the Spaniards in their dif- liege
ferent Rfations, though at considerable distance
from each other, but were employed to cover the

h^_r3 when they attempted to annoy the troops as they
52. advanced towards the city. Cortes formed the bri-

gantines in three divisions, appointing one to cover
each of the Rations from which an attack was to be
carried on against the city, with orders to second the
operations of the officer who commanded there.
From all the three stations he puihed on the attack
against the city with equal vigour ; but in a manner
so very different from the conduct of sieges in regu-
lar war, that he himfelffeems afraid it would appear
no less improper than singular, to persons unac-
quainted with his situation c. Each morning his
troops afaulted the barricades which the enemy had
crected on the caufcways, forced their way over
the trenches which they had dug, and through the
canals where the bridges were broken down, and
endeavoured to penetrate into the heart of the city,
in hopes of obtaining some decisive advantage,
which might force the enemy to surrender, ant
terminate the war at once; but when the obstinate
valour of the Mexicans rendered the efforts of the
day ineffeEtual, the Spaniards retired in the even-
ing to their former quarters. Thus their toil and
danger were, in some measure, continually renew-
ed; the Mexicans repairing in the night what the
Spaniards had destroyed through the day, and re-
covering the posts from which they had driven
them, But neceni ty prescribed this (low and unl

toward mode of operation. The number of his B o o
troops was so small, that Cortes durst not, with a
handful of men, attempt to make a lodgment in a J
city where he might be surrounded and annoyed
by such a multitude of enemies. The remem-
brance of what he had already suffered by the ill-
judged confidence with which, he had ventured into
Iuch a dangerous situation, was still fresh in his
mind. The Spaniards, exhausted with fatigue,
were unable to guard the var.ous polls which they
daily gained; and though their camp was filled
with Indian auxiliaries, they durst not devolve this
charge upon them, because they were so little ac-
customed to discipline, that no confidence could
be placed in their vigilance. Besides this, Cortes
was extremely solicitous to preserve the city as
much as poflible from being destroyed, both be-
cause he destined it to be the capital of his con-
queits, and wished that it might remain as a mo-
nument of his glory. From all there confidera-
tions, he adhered obstinately, for a month after
the siege was opened, to the system which he had
adopted. The Mexicans, in their own defence,
diplayed valour which was hardly inferior to that
with which the Spaniards attacked them. On land,
on water, by night and by day, one furious con-
flics succeeded to another. Several Spaniards were
killed, more wounded, and all were ready to fink
under the toils of unintermitting service, which
were rendered more intolerable by the injuries of

Endeavours ASTONISHED and disconcerted with the length
ciybkynorm. and difficulties of the siege, Cortes determined to

make one great effort to get pofleffon of the city,
before he relinquished the plan which he had hi-
therto followed, and had recourse to any other
mode of attack. With this view, he sent inftruc-
tions to Alvarado and Sandoval to advance with
their divisions to a general aflault, and took the
comnmand in person of that posted on the causeway
july ;. of Cuyocan. Animated by his pretence, and the

expectation of some decisive event, the Spaniards
pushed forward with irresistible impetuosity. They
broke through one barricade after another, forced
their way over the ditches and canals, and having
entered the city, gained ground incefantly, in
spite of the multitude and ferocity of their oppo-
nents. Cortes, though delighted with the rapidity
of his progress, did not forget that he might itill
find it necessary to retreat; and in order to secure
it, appointed Julian de Alderete, a captain of
chief note in the troops which he had received from
H-ilpaniola, to fill up the canals and gaps in the
causeway as the main body advanced. That cffi-
cer, deeming it inglorious to be thus employed,
while his companions were in the heat of ation and
the career of victory, neglected the important

eharge committed to him, and hurried on, incon- B 0o K
fiderately, to mingle with the combatants. The I
Mexkads, whole military attention and skill were 1
daily improving, no sooner observed this, than they
carried an account of it to their monarch.

GUATIMOZIN instantly discerned the confe- Repulsed

quences of the error which the Spaniards had com-
mitted, and, with admirable presence of mind,
prepared to take advantage of it. He commanded
the troops posted in the front to flacken their es-
forts, in order to allure the Spaniards to pulh for-
ward, while he dispatched a large body of chosen
warriors through different streets, some by land,
and others by water, towards the great breach in
the caufcway, which had been left open. On a
signal which he gave, the priests in the principal
temple struck the great drum consecrated to the
god of war. No sooner did the Mexicans hear its
doleful solemn found, calculated to inspire them
with contempt of death and enthusiastic ardour,
than they rushed upon the enemy with frantic rage.
The Spaniards, unable to resist men urged on no
less by religious fury than hope of success, began
to retire, at first leisurely, and with a good coun-
tenance; but as the enemy pressed on, and their
own impatience to escape increased, the terror and
confusion became so general, that when they ar-
rived at the gap in the causeway, Spaniards and
Tlalcalans, horsemen and infantry, plunged in
promiscuously, while the Mexicans rushed upon

zeal of the provinces, which had already declared

which had hitherto remained inative, took arms,
with enthusiastic ardour, to execute the decree of
the gods. The Indian auxiliaries who had joined
Cortes, accuitomed to venerate the fame deities
with the Mexicans, and to receive the responses of
their priests with the fame implicit faith, abandon-
·ed the Spaniards as a race of men devoted to cer-
tain deftrution. Even the fidelity of the Tlafca-
lans was shaken, and the Spanith troops were left
almost alone in their fiations. Cortes, finding that
he attempted in vain to dispel the superstitious fears
of his confederates by argument, took advantage,
from the imprudence of those who had framed the
prophecy, in fixing its accornpliiment so near at
hand, to give a striking demonstration of its falsity.

the gods who had now deceived the Mexicans, had
decreed finally to withdraw their protetion from
them, joined his itandard; and such was the levity
of a simple people, moved by every flight impref-
sion, that, in a short time after such a general de-
fe&ion of his confederates, Cortes saw himself, if
we may believe his own account, at the head of a

Instead of renewing his attempts to become malter
of the city at once, by such bold but dangerous
efforts of valour as he had already tried, he made
his advances gradually, and with every possible
precaution against expoling his men to any cala-
mity similar to that which they frill bewailed. As
the Spaniards pufled forward, the Indians regu-
larly repaired the causeways behind them. As
soon as they got possession of any part of the town,
the houses were instantly levelled with the ground.
Day by day, the Mexicans, forced to retire as
their enemies gained ground, were hemmed in
within more narrow limits. Guatimozin, though
unable to stop the career of the enemy, continued

which Guatimozin had laid up were exhausted, by
the multitudes which had crowded into the capital,
to defend their sovereign and the temples of their
gods. Not only the people, but persons of the
highest rank, felt the utmost distresses of famine.

BUT,

firm and ithnfubdued. He rejected, Wthti scorn, couraand
every overtureof peace from Cortes; and, disdain- oGlati:oir
ing the idea of submitting to the oppregfors of his
country, determined not to survive its ruin. The
Spaniards continued their progress. At length all Ju.y =7z
the three divisions penetrated into the great square
in the centre of the city, and made a secure lodge-
ment there. Three-fourths of the City were no*
reduced, and laid in ruins. The remaining quar-
ter was so closely pressed, that it could not long
withstand assailants, who attacked it from their hev
hation with superior advantage, and more assured
expe(tation of success. The Mexican nobles, soli-
citous to save the life of a monarch whom they
revered, prevailed oh Guatimozin to retire from a
place where refinance was now vain, that he might
route the more distant provinces of the empire to
arms, an'd rainiain there a more successful struggle
with the public enemy. In order to facilitate the
execution of this measure, they endeavoured to
amuse Cortes with overtures of ftubmiflion, that,
while his attention was employed in adjusting the
articles of pacification, Guatimozin might escape
unperceived. Bkie they made this attempt upon a
leader of greater sagacity and discernment than to
be deceived by their arts, Cortes suspeCting their

Holguin eagerly seized his prize, and Guatimozin,
with a dignified composure, gave hinfelf up into
his hands, requesting only that no insult might be
offered to the empress or his children. When con-
duted to Cortes, he appeared neither with the
fullen fierceness of a barbarian, nor with the de-
jection of a supplicant. " I have done," said he,
addressing himself to the Spanish general, " what
became a monarch. I have defended my people

terminated the siege of Mexico, the mRdft me-
morable event in the conques: of America. It
cotin'ued feventy-five days, hardly one ds which
pafled without some extraordinary effort of one
party in the attack, or of the other in the defence
of a city, on the fate of which both knew that the
fortune of the empire depended. As the struggle
here was more obstinate, it was likewise more
equal, than any between the inhabitants of the Old
and New Worlds. The great' abilities of Guati-
mozin, the number of his troops, the peculiar
situation of his capital, so fat counterbalanced the
superiority of the Spaniards in arms and discipline,
that they must haVe relinquished the enterprise, it
they had trusted for success to themselves aorie.

FERDINAND MAGALHAENS, or Magellan, a
Portuguese gentleman of honourable birth, having
served several years in the East Indies, with di-
ftinguifhed valour, under the famous Albuquerque,
demanded the recompence which he thought due
to his services, with the boldness natural to a high-
spirited soldier. But as his general would not grant
his suit, and he expeted greater juflice from his
sovereign, whom he knew to be a good judge and
a generous rewarder of merit, he quitted India
abruptly, and returned to Liibon. In order to
induce Emanuel to liften more favourably to his
claim, he not only stated his past services, but of-
sered to add to them by conducting his country-
men to the Molucca or Spice Islands, by {olding a
westerly course; which he contended would be both
shorter and less hazardous than that which the Por-
tuguefe now followed by the Cape of Good Hope,
through the immense extent of the Eastern Ocean.
This was the original and favourite projc& of Co-
lumbus, and Magellan founded his hopes offuccefs
on the ideas of that great navigator, confirmed by
many observations, the result of his own naval ex-
perience, as well as that of his countrymen in their
intercourse with the East. But though the Portu-
guefe Monarchs had the merit of having first
awakened and encouraged the spirit of discovery in
that age, it was their destiny, in the course of a

C c 4 few

P Q o K few. years, to rejcit two grand schemes for this

..-.- purpose, the execution of which would have been
J'4' attended with a great acceflion of glory to their

reigns and of power to their kingdom, In confe-
quence of some ill-founded prejudice against Ma-
gellan, or of omre dark intrigue which contempo.
rary hiatorians have not explained, Emanuel would
neither bestow the recompence which he demanded,
sor approve of the scheme which he proposed; and
dismissed him with a disdainful cold ness intolerable
to a man conscious of what he deserved, and ani.
mated with the sanguine hopes of success peculiar
to those who are capable of forming or of conduct-
ing new and great undertakings. In a transport of
resentment, Magellan formally renounced his alle.
Xs1;" giance to an ungraceful master, and fled to the

qQurt of Castile, where he expected- that his talents
would be more jutly estimated. He endeavoured
to recommend himself by offering to execute, un-
der the patronage of Spain, that scheme, which he
had laid before the court of Portugal, the ac-
cornplifhient of which, he knew, would wound
the monarch against whom he was exasperated in
the molt tender part. In order to establish the
justness of his theory, he produced the fame ar-
guments which he had employed at Lisbon; ac-
knowledging, at the fame time, that the undertaking
was both arduous and expensive, as it could not
be attempted but with a squadron of considerable
force, and viAtualled for at least two years. For-
syln4tely, he applied to a minirter who was not

apt

tpt to be deterred, either by the boldness of a de- B o o K
sign, or the experce of carrying it into execution. '
Cardinal Ximenes, who at that time direEted the ,st.
affairs of Spain, discerning at once what an in-
crease of wealth and glory would accrue to his
country by the success of Magellan's proposal,
listened to it with a most favourable ear. Charles V.
on his arrival in his Spanish dominions, entered
into the meafire with no less ardour, and orders
were issued for equipping a proper squadron at the
public charge, of which the command was given
to Magellan, whom the king honoured with the
habit of St. Jago and the title of Captain-
General P.

men, among whom were some of the molt fldlful

winding dangerous channel, to which he gave his
own name, and where one of his ships deserted,
him, the great Southern Ocean opened to his
view, and with tears of joy he returned thanks to
Heaven for having thus far crowned his endea-
yours with success, : -

BuT he was frill at a greater distance than he
imagined from the object of his wishes. He failed
during three months and twenty days in an.uni-
form direction towards the north-west, without
discovering land. In this voyage, the longest that
had ever been made in the unbounded ocean,. he
suffered incredible distress. His flock of provi-
sions was almost exhausted, the water became
putrid, the men were reduced to the shortest al-
lowance with which it was possible to sustain life,
end the scurvy, the molt dreadful of all the mala-
dies with which sea-faring people are afflicted, be-
gan to spread among the crew. One circumstance
alone afforded them some consolation; they en-
joyed an uninterrupted course of fair weather, with
filch favourable winds, that Magellan beltowed on
that ocean the name of Pacific, which it still retains.

THE Spaniards were not satisfied with the glory

of having first encompassed the earth; they ex-
peeed to derive great commercial advantages from
this new and boldest effort of their nartitime fklill.
The men of science among them contended, that
the spice islands; and several of the. richest 'coun-
tries in the East, were so situated as to belong of
right to the crown of Caffile, in consequence of
the partition made by Alexander VI. The' mer-
chants, without attending to this discussion,. en-
gaged eagerly in that lucrative and alluring comrn
merce, which was now opened to them. The
Portuguese, alarmed at the intrusion of such for-
midable rivals, remnonflrated and negociated in
Europe, while in Asia they obftruted the trade of
the Spaniards by force of arms. Charles V. not
sufficiently inftruted with refpeE to the import-
ance of this valuable branch of commerce, or
diftraded by the multiplicity of his schemes and
operations, did not afford his fubjeEts proper pro-
teetion. At ladt, the low stare of his finances, ex-
haufted by tht efforts of his arms in every part of
Europe, together with the dread of adding a new
war with Portugal to those ih which he was already

engaged,

engaged, induced him to. make, over his claim of B o o K
the Moluccas- to the Portuguefgefor three hundred Lv. -
and fifty thousand ducats. He reserved, however,
to the crowq of Castile the right of reviving its,
pretensions on repayment of that furm; but other
objects engrossed his attention and that of his fuc-
ceflors; and Spain was finally excluded from a
branch of commerce in which it was engaging with
sanguine expectations of profit '.

THOUGH the trade with the Moluccas was relin-

quifhed, the voyage of Magellan was followed by
commercial effets of great moment to Spain.
Philip II. in the year one thousand five hundred
and fixty-four, reduced those islands which he dif-
covered in the Eastern Ocean to fubjeaion, and
established settlements there; between which and
the kingdom of New Spain, a regular intercourse,
the nature of which shall be explained in its proper

A few weeks after the reduction of Mexico, Tapia

improper instrument to wreak his vengeance on

tions of the country, and with rich presents to the
emperor, as the earnest of future contributions
from his new conquest ; requesting, in recom-
pence for all his services, the approbation of his
proceedings, and that he might be entrufled with
the government of those territories, which his con-
dun, and the valour of his followers, had added
to the crown of Castile. The juncture in which
his deputies reached the court was favourable.
The internal commotions in Spain, which had dif-
quieted the beginning of Charles's reign, were just

attention towards foreign affairs. The account of
Cortes's viEtories filled his countrymen with ad-

became the object of vast and interesting hopes.
Whatever stain he might have contraLced, by the
irregularity of the steps which he took in order to
attain power, was so fully effaced by the splendor
and merit of the great actions which this had
enabled him to perform, that every heart revolted

cure and beneficial acquisition to his country. He
determined to establish the feat of government in
its ancient fiation, and to raise Mexico again
from its ruins; and having conceived high ideas
concerning the future grandeur of the slate of
which he was laying the foundation, he began to
rebuild its capital on a plan which hath gradually
formed the moRt magnificent city in the New
World. At the fame time, he employed flilill

principal officers into the remote provinces, and
encouraged them to fettle there, not only. by be-
Rfowing upon them large tracts of land, but by
granting them the fame dominion over the Indians,
and the fame right to their service, which the Spa-

dered desperate by oppreflIon, the natives often
forgot the superiority of their enemies, and ran to
arms in defence of their liberties. In every con-
test, however, the European valour and discipline
prevailed. But, fatally for the honour of their
country, the Spaniards sullied the glory redound-
ing from there repeated victories by their mode of
.treating the vanquifled people. After taking
Guatimozin, and becoming masters of his capital,
they supposed that the king of Caitile entered on
possession of all the rights of the captive monarch,
and affected to confider every effort of the Mexicans
to :assert their own independence, as the rebellion
of vafTals againfl their sovereign, or the mutiny of
slaves against their matter. Under the sanction of
those ill-founded maxims, they violated every
right that flould be held sacred between hostile
nations. After each infurreftion, they reduced the

'5"' that of personal servitude. Their chiefs, supposed

to be more criminal, were punihied with greater
severity, and put to death in the most ignominious
cr the moflt;excruciating mode, that the inlo.
knce or the cruelty of their conquerors could de-
vilfe. In almost every diftriat of the Mexican
emipire, the progress of the Spanish arms is marked
with blood, and with deeds so atrocious, as dif-
grace the enterprising valour that conducted them
to success. In the country of Panucd, :sixty ca-
ziques, or leaders, and four hundred nobles, were
burnt at one time. Nor was this shocking barba-
rity perpetrated in any sudden sally of rage, or by
a commander of inferior note. It was the aRt of
Sandoval, an officer whose name is entitled to
the second rank in the annals of New Spain, and
executed after a solemn consultation with Cortes;
and to complete the horror of the scene, the chil-
dren and relations of the wretched victims were
'assembled, and compelled to be spectators of their
dying agonies Y. It seems hardly porfible to ex-
ceed in horror this dreadful example of severity;
but it was followed by another, which affected
the Mexicans frill more sensibly, as it gave them
a molt feeling proof of their own degradation,

firmed by very imperfect evidence, that Guatimo- A_ j

and to excite his former fubjets to take arms,
Cortes, without the formality of a trial, ordered
the unhappy monarch, together with the caziques
of Tezeuco and Tacuba, the two persons of greatest
eminence in the empire, to be hanged; and the
Mexicans, with astonishment and horror, beheld
this disgraceful punishment inflicted upon persons,
to whom they were accustomed to look up with
reverence, hardly inferior to that which they paid
to the gods themselves z. The example of Cortes
and his principal officers encouraged and justified

by which those precious metals are separated from

New Spain, which have poured forth their trea-
fures with such profusion on every quarter of the

the conquest b, By that time, a more orderly go-

industry, but of inferior merit. The early hirfo-
rians of America abound with accounts of the
sufferings and of the poverty of its conquerors.
In New Spain, their condition was rendered more
grievous by a peculiar arrangement. When Charles
V. advanced Cortes to the government of that
country, he at the fame time appointed certain
commissioners to receive and administer the royal
revenue there, with independent jurifdition d
These men, chosen from inferior stations in various
departments of public business at Madrid, were so
much elevated with their promotion, that they
thought they were called to aft a part of the firfl
consequence. But being accustomed to the mi-
nute formalities of office, and having contracted
the narrow ideas suited to the sphere in which
they had hitherto moved, they were astonished, on
arriving in Mexico, at the high authority which y5,f.
Cortes exercised, and could not conceive that the
mode of administration, in a country recently sub-
dued and fettled, must be different from what
took place in one where tranquillity and regular
government had been long eftablilhed. In their
letters, they represented Cortes as an ambitious
tyrant, who having usurped a jurifdiition superior

representation of all his actions. The apprehen-

new commilflon of enquiry was issued, with more
extensive powers, and various precautions were
taken in order to prevent or to punish him, if he
should be so presumptuous as to attempt what was
inconsistent with the fidelity of a fubjest h. Cortes
beheld the approaching crisis of his fortune with
all the violent emotions natural to a haughty mind,

to chute the only course in which he could secure

the eminence of his services, to the highest marks

the title of Marquis del Valle de Guaxaca, the
grant of a vast territory in New Spain, were fuc-

to commit such an. important charge to a man: _
whom he had once fufpe&ed, peremptorily refused .'5s*
to invest him again with powers which he might
find it impossible to controul. Cortes, though Is3o.
dignified with new titles, returned to Mexico with
diminiflled authority. The military department
with powers to attempt new discoveries, was left
in his hands; but the supreme direction of civil
affairs was placed in a board, called The Audience
of New Spain. At a subsequent period, when,
upon the increase of the colony, the exertion of
authority more united and extensive became necef-
fary, Antonio de Mendoza, a nobleman of high
rank, was sent thither as Viceroy, to take the go-
vernment into his hands.
THIS division of power in New Spain proved, as New

was unavoidable, the source of perpetual diffen- of Cortes.
tion, which embittered the life of Cortes, and
thwarted all his schemes. As lie had now no op-
portunity to dilplay his a&ive talents but in at-
tempting new discoveries, he formed various
schemes for that purpose, all of which bear impref-
sions of a genius that delighted in what was bold
and splendid. He early entertained an idea, that,
dilher by fleering through the gulf of Florida
along the east coalt of North America, some ftraic
would be found that communicated with the weft-
cin ocean; or that, by examining the ifthmns of
Darien, fomc paslige would be dlifcovered between

17 the

o o K the North and South Seas . But having been dif

_

-v-- appointed in his expectations with respect to both;
'530' he now confined his views to such voyages of dif

covery as he could make from the ports of New
Spain in the South Sea. There he fitted out fuc.
ceffively several finall squadrons, which either pe.
rilhed in the attempt, or returned without making
any discovery of moment. Cortes, weary of entrust.
3536. ing theconduct of his operations to others, took

the command of a new armament in person, and,
after enduring incredible hardships, and encoun.
tering dangers of every species, he discovered the
large peninsula of- California, and surveyed the
greater part of the gulf which separates it from
New Spain. The discovery of a country of such
extent would have reflected credit on a common
adventurer; but it could add little new honour to
the name of Cortes, and was far from satisfying
the sanguine expectations which he had formed",
Disgusted with ill success, to which he had not
been accustomed, and weary of contesting with
adversaries to whom he confidered it as a disgrace

No service of moment was now expe¢ted from a

grievances received no redress; his claims were
urged without efect; and after several years spent
in fruitless application to miniflers and judges, an
occupation the most irksome and mortifying to a
man of high spirit, who had moved in a sphere
where he was more accustomed to command than
to solicit, Cortes ended his days on the second of
December one thousand five hundred and forty-

fate was the fame with that of all the persons who
diltinguifhed themselves in the discovery or con-

of hiflory or geography that the mouth of the river De la
Plata was an hundred and fifty miles in breadth, I con.
fidered it as an exaggeration, because in this hemisphere
we have no example of such vast rivers. When I ap-
proached its mouth, I had the mos vehement desire to
ascertain the truth with my own eyes; and I have found
the matter to be exactly as it was represented. This I
deduce particularly from one circumstance: \Vhen we
took our departure from Monte-Video, a fort situated
more than a hundred miles from the mouth of the river,
and where its breadth is considerably diminished, we failed
a complete day before we discovered the land on the op-
podite bank of the river; and when we were in the middle
of the channel, we could not discern land on either fide,
and saw nothing but the sky and water, as if we had been
in some great ocean. Indeed, we should have taken it
to be sea, if the fresh water of the river, which was turbid
like the Po, had not satisfied us that it was a river.
Moreover, at Buenos Ayres, another hundred miles up
the river, and where it is still much narrower, it is not
only impossible to discern the opposite coast, which is in-
deed very low and flat; but one cannot perceive the
houses or the tops of the lteeples in the Portuguese fettle-

ing and placing it in the moll firiking liglt. Some re-
marks may be added, which tend to illuitrate more fully
a doEtrine of much importance in every inquiry concern-
ing the temperature of various climates.

WIIEN a cold wind blows over land, it nullt in its pai-
sage rob the surface of tome of its heat. By means of
thils, the coldness of tile wind is abated. But if it con-
tinue to blow in the fame direction, it will come, by de-
grees, to pals over a surface already cooled, and will sus-
ser no longer any abatement of its own keenness. Thus
as it advances over a large trai1 of land, it brings on all
the feverit), of intense floll.

LET the faine wind blow over an extenTlve and deep

sea; the filperficial water mufl be inmmediately cooled to
a certain degree, and the wiind propoltion.llly warmed.
But the fuperficidl and colder water becoiwiig Ipecilica!ly

heavier than the warmer water below it, descends; wa,;
is warmer supplies its place, which, as it comes to be
cooled in its turn, continues to warm the air wlicli
passes over it, or to diminish its cold. This change of
the superficial water, and fucceflive ascent of that which is
warmer, and the coiielquent successive abatement of cold-
ness in the air, is aided by the agitation caused in the fC;
by the mechanical astion of the wind, and also by the
motion of the tides. This will go on, and the rigour of
the wind will continue to diminifl until the whole waLer
is so far cooled, that 'the water on the surface is no longer
removed from the action of the wind, fall enough to hin.
der it from being arrested by frofl. Whrenever the surface
freezes, the wind is no longer warmed by the water from
below, and it goes on with undiminishcd cold.

FROM those principles may be explained the severity of

winter frofis in extensive continents; their mildness in
finall islands; and the superior rigour of winter in thole
parts of North America with which we are belt ac-
quainted. In the north-west parts of Europe, the severity
of winter is mitigated by the weft winds, which ufiallv
blow in the months of November, December, and part of
January.

ON the other hand, when a warm wind blows over

land, it heats the surface, which must therefore ceafc to
abate the fervour of the wind. But the fame wind blow-
ing over water, agitates it, brings up the colder water
from below, and thus is continually losing fomewllat us
its own heat.

BUT the great power of the sea to mitigate the heat of

the wind or air palling over it, proceeds from thc follow-
ing circumitance, that on account of the tranflarcncy of

tlhe

the lea, its surface cannot be heated to a great degree by
the fun's rays; whereas the ground, subjected to their
influence, very soon acquires great heat. When, there-
fore, the wind blows over a torrid continent, it is soon
raised to a heat almost intolerable; hut during its pafrage
over an cxtenfive ocean, it is gradually cooled; so that
on its arrival at the fartheit shore, it is again fit for re-
fpiration.

THOSE principles will account for the sultry heats of

large continents in the torrid zone; for the mild climate
of islands in the fame latitude; and for the superior warmth
in fumnmer which large continents, situated in the tem-
pcrate or colder zones of the earth, enjoy, when com-
pared with that of islands. The heat of a climate depends
not only upon the immediate effet of the fun's rays, but
on their continued operation, on the effect which they
have formerly produced, and which remains for some
time in the ground. This is the reason why the day is
warmefi about two in the afternoon, the summer warmell
about the middle of July, and the winter coldcft about
the middle of January.

THE forests which cover America, and hinder the fun-

beams from heating the ground, are a great cause of the
temperate climate in the equatorial parts. The ground,
not being heated, cannot heat the air; and the leaves,
which receive the rays intercepted fiom the ground, have
not a mars of matter ti.ficient to abflob heat enough for
tlis purpose. Becides, it is a known faEc, that the vege-
talive power of a plant occasions a perspiration from the
leaves in proportion to the heat to which they are cx-
posed ; and, from tlie nature of evaporation, this perfii-
ration produces a cold in the leaf proporiional to the per-
Ipirationl. 1Thus the c;:t
t he of t le as in heating the air

E c 3 in

in contact. with it, is prodigiously diminished. For those
oblervations, which throw much additional light on this
curious fubjcrE, I am indebted to my ingenious friend,

TWO French frigates were sent upon a voyage of

discovery in the year 1739. In latitude 44° south,

they began to feel a considerable degree of cold. In lati-
tude 480, they met with islands of floating ice. Hifloire

compares the climate to that of England in the middle
of winter. Voyages by Hawkefworth, i. 25. Mr. Banks
having landed on Terra del Fuego, in the Bay of Good

corresponds to the month of July in our hemisphere, two
of his attendants died in one night of extreme cold, and
all the party were in the molt imminent danger of perish-
ing. Id. ii. 51, 52. By the fourteenth of March, cor-
responding to September in our hemisphere, winter was
fct in with rigour, and the mountains were covered with
snow. Ibid. 72. Captain Cook, in his voyage towards
the South pole, furnishes new and striking inflances of
the extraordinary predominance of cold in this region of
the globe. " Who would have thought (fays he) that
an island, of no greater extent than seventy leagues in
circuit, situated between the latitude of 54° and 55°,
should in the very height of Summer be, in a manner,
vwholly covered, nany lftlhomns deep, with frozen snow;
hut more cfpecially the S. W. coast ? The very firnlmits
of the lofty mountains were cafled wili snow and ice; but
the quantity that lay in the valleys is incredible; andl at

E c 4, thl

the bottom of the bays, the coast was terminated by a wal;
of ice of confiderabie height." Vol. ii. p. 217.

IN some places of the ancient continent, an extraor'li

nary degree of cold prevails in very low latitudes. Mi.
Bogle, in his einbafly to the court of the Dclai L'1;:,
palled the winter of the year 1774 at Chamnanning, i!i
latitude 31° 39' N. He often found the thermometer ::I
his room twenty-nine degrees under the freezing point 1r.
Fahrenheit's scale ; and in the middle of April the flan:l-
ing waters were all frozen, and heavy showers of fil!,:
frequently fell. The extraordinary elevation of the coun-
try feerns to be the cause of tils excessive cold. In ira.
velling from Intdoitan to Thibet, the afccnt to the fiin-
mit of tle Boutan Mountains is very great, but tie
descent on the other fide is not in equal proportion. T';
kingdom of Thibet is an elevated region, extremely lar
and de'olate. Account of Thibet, by Mr. Stcwart, r-ce.
in the Royal Society, p. 7. The extraordinary cold in
low latitutdes in America cannot be accounted for by the
filme cause. Tllofe regions are not remarkable for elcva-
tiuo. Some of them are countries depressed and level.

THE most obvious and probable cau!c of the filperi;r

degree of cold, towards the southern extremity of Ane-
rica, seems to he the form of tle continent there. Its
b.cadtl gradtluilly decreases as it firctches from St. Anto-

body of water, nor is the land there of such extent that it
can recover any considerable degree of heat in its progret'
over it. Tliefe circumstances concur in rendering the
temperature of the air in this diflriE of America, more
fiiilar to that of an infilar, than to that of a continental
climate, andl inder it from acquiring the fame degree ot
finnmer leat with places in Europe and Aia, in a corre-
fponding northern latitude. The north wind is the only
one that reaches this part of America, after blowing over
a great continent. But from an attentive survey of its
p(fition, this will be found to have a tendency, rather to
dimniniisl than augment the degree of heat. The fouthcrn
extremity of America is properly the termination of the
inmmenfe ridge of tile Andes, which firetches nearly in a
direc line from north to south, through the whole extent
of the continent. The molt sultry regions in South Aine-
rica, Guiana, Brasil, Paraguay, and Tucuman, lie many
degrees to the eafl of the Magellanic regions. The level
country of Peru, which enjoys the tropical heats, is situ-
ated confiderablv to the wetl of them. The north wind
then, though it blows over land, does not bring to the
southern extremity of America, an increase of heat col-
!eEted in its paflage over torrid regions ; but before it ar-
rives there, it inull have fwvcpt along the fummiits of the
Andes, and conies impregnated with the cold of that frozen
region.

T-tOU UGH it be now dcmonifrated tlhat there is no south-

crn continicnt in that region of the globe whicll it was
fupppoldc to occulpy, it appears to be certain front Captain
Cook's difcovcrics, that there is a large traA. of land( near
the louth pole, which is the source of moll of the ice
IjFread over the vail Ibutlicrn ocean. Vol. ii. p. 230, 239,
&c. Whcthcr the inllucnce of tlhis remote fiozen con-

tineuit

tinent may reach the southern extremity of America,
and affect its climate, is an inquiry not unworthy of attert
tion.

by the Indians, which are usually employed as ropes in
America. This is one of the parasitical plants, which
twifls about the trees it meets with, and rising above their
highest branches, its tendrils descend perpendicularly, firike
into the ground, take root, rife up around another tree,
and thus mount and descend alternately. Other tendrils
are carried obliquely by the wind, or some accident, and
form a confusion of interwoven cordage, which resembles

T H E animals of America seem not to have been al-

wa)ys of a size inferior to those in otlecr quarteis of

the globe. From antlers of the moofe-dcer whlich have
been found in America, it appears to have been an animal
of great size. Near the banks of the Ohio, a considerable
number of bones of an immense magnitude have been
found. The place vlwere this discovery has been made
lies about one hundred and ninety miles below the juncion
of the river Scioto with the Ohio. It is about four miles
diflant fron the banks of the latter, on the fide of the
marlh calledl the Salt Lick. The bones lie in vast quanti-
ties about five or fix feet under ground, and the firatum is
visible in the bank on the edge of the Lick. 7ournal of
Clinel Gcorg C(r:g!ain, /MS. jeres ime. This spot fecms to
be accurately laid down by Evans in his nllip. 1 lieic
bones miil have belonged to animals of enornnons bulk; bill

pllant

phant is the largest known quadruped, and the tusks which
were found nearly resembled, both in form and qualit-,
the tusks of an elephant, it was concluded that the car-
cafes deposited on the Ohio were of that species. But Dr.
Hunter, one of the persons of our age best qualified to de-
cide with irfpea to this point, having accurately examined
several parcels of tusks, and grinders, and jaw-bones, sent
from the Ohio to London, gives it as his opinion, that
they did not belong to an elephant, but to some huge car-
nivorous animal of an unknown species. Phil. Tranfat.

able for their size, have been found near the mouths of
the great rivers Oby, Jenifeia, and Lena, in Siberia.
Stralh.re.lcrg, , Dtfcript. of norlh and eafl Parts of Europe
and Asia, p. 4c2, &c. The elephant seems to be confined
in his range to the torrid zone, and never multiplies be-
yond it. In filch cold regions as those bordering on the
frozen sea, he could not live. The existence of such large
animals in America might open a wide field for conjecture.
The more we contemplate the face of nature, and confider
the variety of her productions, the more we muff be satis-
sied that afloniffing changes have been made in the
terraqueous globe by convulsions and revolutions, of which
no account is preserved in hiflory.

NOTE IX. p. 20.
THIS degeneracy of the domelic European animals

in America ought to be imputed partly to each of

these causes. In the Spanish settlements, which are situ-
ated either within the torrid zone, or in countries hoidcr-
ing upon it, the increase of heat, and divcrfity of food,
prevent fllccp and horned cattle from attaining the fame fi.e
as in Europe. They seldom become so fat, and their flcfh is

riut

not so juicy, or of such delicate flavour. In North Ame-
rica, where the climate is more favourable, and finilar to
that of Europe, the quality of the graffes which ipring up
naturally in their pafture-grounds is not good. Mitchell,
p. I5I. Agriculture is fill so much in its infancy, that
artificial food for cattle is not raised in any quantity. Du-
ring a winter, long in many provinces, and rigorous in all,
no proper care is taken of their cattle. The general treat-
ment of their horses and horned cattle is injudicious and
harsh in all the English colonies. There circumtianccs
contribute more, perhaps, than any thing peculiar in the
quality of the climate, to the degeneracy of breed in the
horses, cows, and sleep, of many of the North American
provinces.

IN the year 1518, the iland of Hispaniola was affliaed

with a dreadful visitation of those deflrutive infecs,

After trying various methods of exterminating the ants,
they resolved to implore protecion of the faints; but as
the calamity was new, they were at a lots to find out the
faint who could give them the monft effecalial aid. They
cast lots in order to discover the patron whom they fihould
invoke. The lots decided in favour of St. Saturninus.
They celebrated his feflival with great solemnity, and im-

that during the rainy seasons it is usually covered with

a firatum of perse& manure, and as such has been tranf-
ported to Barbadoes. On the banks of the Effequebo,
thirty crops of ratan canes have been raised fucceflively,

W ERE this the place for entreing into a loig and in-

tricate geographical difilulfitionl, Ininy curious ob-
servations might arise from comparing the accounts of the

th~o

two Ruffian voyages, and the charts of their reflpeLive
navigations. One remark is applicable to both. We can-
not rely with absolute Certainty on the position which tlecy
assign to several of the places which they visited. The
weather was so extremely foggy, that they seldom fawx tie
fun or flars, and the pofitiun of the islands and fiUtpolti:d
continents was commonly determined by reckoning, not
by observation. Behring and Tfchirikow proceeded !:mic
farther towards the east than Krenitzin. The land dilco-
vered by Behring, which he imagined to be part of Lie
American continent, is in the 236th degree of longitude
from the firfl meridian in the isle of Ferro, and in 58.,
a8" of latitude. Tfchirikow came upon the fame coatl in
longit. 24I°, lat. 560. Muller, i. 248, 249. The form:r
niut have advanced 60 degrees from the port of Pctou-
pawlowfki, from which lie took his departure, and the
latter 65 degrees. But from the chart of Krenitziti's vos-
age, it appears that he did not fail farther towards the call
than the 2o8th degree, and only 32 degrees from Petro-
pawlowfki. In I741, Behring and Tfchirikow, both in
going and returning, held a course which was mostly to
the south of that chain of islands, which they difcovcrcd;
and observing the mountainous and rugged aspet of the
head-lands which they descried towards the north, thery
supposed them to be promontories belonging to some part
of the American continent, which, as they fanciel,
firetched as far south as the latitude 56. In this inalncr
they are laid down in the chart publishcd by Muller, and
lilkewife in a manuscript chart drawn by a mate of Belh-
ring's Ihip, communicated to me by Mr. Profcflbr Rl-
bison. But in 1769, Krenitzin, after wintering in lhe
illand Alaxa, flood lo far towards the north in his rcttiii,
that his course lay through the middle of what Bellrilng
and Tfchirikow had fuppufel to be a continent, Which lc
fould to be an open sea, and that they had miltaken rocky

JS~~~~~~~~~~15 ~~~~~illci

illes for the head-lands of a continent. It is probable, that
lile countries discovered in 174r, towards the east, do not
bloing to the American continent, but are only a conti-
;iuation of the chain of islands. The number of volcanos
in this region of the globe is remarkable. There are feve-
ral in Kamchatka, and not one of the islands, great or
!fnall, as far as the Rullian navigation extends, is without
tiem. Many are actually burning, and the mountains
in all bear marks of having been once in a ilate of crup-
tion. Were I disposed to admit ifch conjctLures as have
itund place in other enquiries concerning the peopling of
America, I might f1ppofe that this part of the eartl, hav-
ing Inaniffctly fufFcred violent convulsions from earthquakes
and voicanos, an ifimllus, which may have formerly
united Asia to America, has been broken, and formed into
a cluflcr of islands by the flock.

IT is singular, that at the very time the Ruffian naviga-
tors were attempting to make discoveries in the north-west
of America, the Spaniards were prosecuting the fame de-
lign from another quarter. In 1769, two small vessels
failed from Loretto in California to explore the coafis of
the country to the north of that peninsula. They advanced
no farther than the port of Monte-Rcy in latitude 36. But,
in several fucceflive expeditions fitted out from the port of
St. Bias in New Galicia, the Spaniards have advanced as
faras tle latitude 58. Gazelca e Aliadrid, March I9, and
May 14, 1776. But as the journals of those voyages
blave not yet been published, I cannot compare their pro-
recfs with that of thle Ruffians, or shew how near the na-
igators of the two nations have approached to each other.
It is to be hoped, that the enlightened miiiller, who has
now the direcion of American aflairs in Spain, will not
witliliold this information from the public.

oUR knowledge of the vicinity of the two continents of

Asia and America, which was very imperfect when I

published the history of America in the year I777, is now
complete. Mr. Coxe's Account of the Ruffian Difcovc.
ries between Asia and America, printed in the year 1780,
contains many curious and important fads with refpecl to
the various attempts of the Ruffians to open a communica.
tion with the New World. The history of the great Voy.
age of discovery, begun by Captain Cook in 1776, and
completed by Captains Clerk and Gore, published in the
year 1780, communicates all the information that the
curiosity of mankind could desire with regard to this
subjeS.

AT my requefl, my friend Mr. Playfair, Professor of

Mathematicks in the University, of Edinburgh, has com.
pared the narrative and charts of those illustrious naviga-
tors, with the more imperfect relations and maps of the
Ruffians. The result of this comparison I communicate
in his own words, with much greater confidence in his
scientific accuracy than I could have ventured to place in
any observations which I myself might have made upon the
fubjca.

'" THE discoveries of Captain Cook in his last voyage

have confirmed the conclusions which Dr. Robertson had
drawn, and have conneclcd together the fadcs from which
they were deduced. They have now rendered it certain
that Behring and Tfchirikow touched on the coast of Ame-
rica in I741. Tle former discovered land in lat. 58" 28,
and about 2360 east from Ferro. He has given such a dc-
scription of the bay in which he anchored, and the high

mountain

:nountain to the wvfltward of it, which he calls St. Elias,
that though the account of Iis voyage is much abridged in
tlie Englifll translation, Captain Cook recognized the place
as he failed along the vweltern coasl of America in the year
1778. The isle or St. Hlermnognccs, near the month of
Cook's river, Sclhumagins Ifcs on the coast of Alafhka, and
Foggy ille, retain in Captain Cook's char: the names which
they had received from the Ruffian navigator. Cook's
Voy. vol. ii. p. 347.

Tsc I I R I OW came upon the fame coast about 2° 30

sartier biouth than Behring, near the Mount Edgecumbe
of Captain Cook.

" WITVI- regard to Krenitzin, we learn from Coxc's

Account of the Ruffian Difcovcrics, that he failed fionm
the mouth of the Kamtfchatka river with two ships in the
ycar 1768. With his own ship he reached the island
Oonolafhka, in which there had been a Ruffian settlement
since the year j762, where he wintered, probably in the
fame harbour or bay where Captain Cook afterwards an-
chored. The other ship wintered at Alafhka, which was
supposed to be an island, though it be in faEt a part of the
American continent. Krenitzin, accordingly, returned
without knowing that either of his ships had been on the
coast of America ; and this is the more furprizing, because
Captain Cook has informed us that Alalfka is understood
to be a great continent both by the Ruffians and the na-
tives at Oonolafhka.

" AcCORDING to Krenitzin, the flip which had win-
ered at Alafhka had hardly failed 320 to the eallward of
tce harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamtclatka;
but, according to the more accurate charts of Captain
Cook, it had lailed no lcfs than 37" 17' to the cafltwrd of
tat harbour, There is nearly the famrnc niiltake of 5" in

F f 2 the

the longitude which Krenitzin assigns to Oonolalhka. It
is remarkable enough, that in the chart of those seas, put
into the hands of Captain Cook by tle Ruffians on that
island, there was an error of the fame kind, and very
nearly of the fame extent.

" BUT what is of most consequence to be remarked on

this subjet is, that the discoveries of Captain Cook have
fully verified Dr. Robertson's conjecture, " that it is pro-
bable that future navigators in those seas, by fleering far-
ther to the north than Behring and Tfchirikow or Krc-
nitzin had done, may find that the continent of America
approaches still nearer to that of Asia." Vol. ii. p. 44. It
has accordingly been found that these two continents, wvlidl
in the parallel of 55°, or that of the southern extremilv
of Alafhka, are about four hundred leagues asunder, ap-
proach continually to one another as they firetch together
toward the north, until, within lets than a degree fromn
the polar circle, they are terminated by two capes, only
thirteen leagues diflant. The east cape of Asia is in lati-
tude 66° 6', and in longitude 190° 22' cast from Green.
wich; the wellern extremity of America, or Prince oi
Wales Cape, is in latitude 65° 46', and in longitude lg9I
45'. Nearly in the middle of the narrow firait (Bellring's
Strait) which fcparates these capes, are the two illands of
St. Diomcde, from which both continents may be flln.
Captain King informs us, that as he was failing through
this firait July 5, 1779, the fog having cleared away, lie
enjoyed the plicafure of feeing from the Ihip the coinlincnts
of Asia and Anmerica at the fame moment, together xvithl
the illands of St. Diomede lying between themn. Cook's
Voy. A1. iii. p. 244.

" BEYOND this point the flrait opens towards ile
Ara'ic Sea, and the coalIs of Asia and America diverge

lb

so fall from one another, that in the parallel of 69° they
are more than one hundred leagues asunder. Ib. p. 277.
To tle south of the strait there are a number of islands,
Clerkc's, King's, Anderson's, &c. which, as well as
those of St. Diomede, may have facilitated the migrations
of the natives from the one continent to the other. Captain
Cook, however, on the authority of the Ruffians at Oono-
lafhka, and for other good reasons, has diminished the
number of islands which had been inserted in former
charts of the northern Archipelago. He has also placed
Alaflika, or the promontory which firetches from the con-
tinent of America S. W. towards Kaintchatka, at the dif-
tance of five degrees of longitude farther from the coafL of
Asia than it was reckoned by the Ruffian navigators.

"T1- E geography of the Old and the New World is there-

fore equally indebted to the discoveries made in this memorable
voyage ; and as many errors have been correced, and many
deficiencies supplied by means of there discoveries, so the
accuracy of fomc former observations has been established.
The basis of the map of the Ruffian Empire, as far as re-
garded Kanmtchatka, and the country of the Tfchutzki, was
the position of four places, Yakutfh, Ochotz, Bolcherefk,
and Petropawlowfni, which had been dctcnnincd by the
afrornomer Kraflilnicow in the year 1744. Nov. Coment.

our Britifl navigators, having determined the position of
Pctropawlofki by a great number of very accurate obferva-
tions, found the longitude of that port 158° 43' E. from
Greenwich, and its latitude 53° I'; agreeing, the firit to
less than seven minutes, and the second so less than half a mi-
nute, withthe calculations of the Ruffian aflronomer: a coin-
cidence which, in the situation of so remote a place, does not
leave an uncertainty of more than four English miles, and
which, for the credit of science, deserves to be particularly
remarked. The chief error in the Ruffian maps has been
in not extending the boundaries of that empire sufficiently
towards the ealt. For as there was nothing to connect
the land of the Tfchutzki and the north-east point of
Asia with thofc places whereof the position had been care.
fully ascertained, except the imperfe& accounts of E3ci-
ring's and Synd's voyages, confidcrable errors could not
fail to be introduced, and that point was laid down as
not more than 230 2' ealt of the meridian of Petropaw-
lofki. Coxe App. i. No. 2. By the observations of
Captain King, the difference of longitude between Petro-
pawlofki and the East Cape is 31° 9'; that is 83 7' greater
than it was supposed to be by the Ruffian geographers.-
It is probable that this interesting portion of geographical
knowledge will, in the course of a few years, receive far-
ther improvement. Soon after the publication of Captain
Cook's last voyage, the great and enlightened Sovereign
of Russia, attentive to every thing that may contribute to
extend the bounds of fcicncc, or to rcndcr it more accu-
rate, formed the plan of a new voyage of discovery, in
order to explore those parts of the ocean lying between
Asia and America, which Captain Cook did not visit, to
examine more accurately the islands which firetch from one
continent alniol t t the other, to survey the north-call

coaf

toast of the Ruffian empire, from the mouth of the Ko-
vyma, or Kolyma, to the North Cape, and to fettle, by
afronomical observations, the position of each place worth
notice. The conduct of this important enterprize is com-
mnitted to Captain Billings, an English officer in the Ruf-
fian service, of whose abilities for that fiation it will be
deemed the best evidence, that he accompanied Captain
Cook in his last voyage. To render the expedition more
extensively useful, an eminent naturalist is appointed to
attend Captain Billings. Six years will be rcquifite for
accompliflhing the purposes of the voyage. Coxc Supple-
ment to Ruffian Discoverics, p. 27, &c.

FEW travellers have had such opportunity of ob-

serving the natives of America, in its various dif-

trijts, as Don Antonio Ulloa. In a work lately pub-
lifhed by him, he thus dcfcribes the charadleriitcal sea-
tures of the race: " a very finall forehead, covered with
hair towards its extremities, as far as the middle of the
eye-brows; littleccyes; a thin nose, small and bending
towards the upper lip; the countenance broad; the ears
large; the hair very black, lank, and coarse; the limbs
well turncd, the feet finall, the body of just proportion;
and altogether smooth and free from hair, until old age,
vwhen they acquire foime beard, but never on the cheeks."
Noticias Americanas, &c. p. 307. M. Ie Chevalier de
Pinto, who rcfitlcd several years in a part of America which
Ulloa never visited, gives a sketch of the general aspect
of the Indians there. " They arc all of copper colour,
with some diversity of shade, not in proportion to their
diflance from the equator, but according to the degree of
elevation of the territory which they inhabit. Those who

F f 4 live

live in a high country are fairer than those in the marflh) low
lands on the coast. Their face is round, farther removed, per.
haps, than that of any people from all oval fliape. Their
forehead is small, the extremity of their ears far from the
face, their lips thick, their nose flat, their eyes black, or
of a chelfnut colour, finall, but capable of discerning ol-
je&s at a great diflance. Their hair is always thick arn:
fleck, and witliout any tendency to curl. They haive
no hair on any part of their body hut the head. At ti,:
firit afpcR, a southern American appears to be mildl nd(
innocent, but on a more attentive view, one discovers in
his countenance something wild, diflruflful, and fillen'."

among the Americans is exaclly in proportion to lieir hla-
bits of labour. The Indians, in warm climates, filch as

tlholi

those on the coasts of the South Sea, on the river of Ama-
zons, and the river Orinoco, are not to be compared for
strength with those in cold countries ; and yet, fays he,
boats daily set out from Para, a Portuguese settlement on
the river of Amazons, to ascend that river against the ra-
pidity of the tfream, and with the fame crew they proceed
to San Pablo, which is eight hundred leagues ditfant. No
crew of white people, or even of negroes, would be found
equal to a task of such persevering fatigue, as the Portu-
guefe have experienced, and yet the Indians, being accuf-
tomed to this labour from their infancy, perform it. MS.

wards had an opportunity of viewing the North-Ame-
ricans, aflerts, " that if we have seen one American, we
may be said to have seen them all, their colour and make
are so nearly the fame." Notic. Americanas, p. 308.
A more early observe'r, Pedro de Cieca de Lcon, one of
the conquerors of Peru, who had likewise traversed many
provinces of America, affirms, that the people, men and
women, although there is such a multitude of tribes or
nations as to be almoll innumerable, and such diversity of
climates, appear ncvc'rthclefs like the children of one fa-
lier and mother. Chronica lel' Peru, parte i. c. 19.

veller at 'firfi fight, iwhile not only the various shades,

cnliar features which discriminate individuals, cfcape his

among the Americans concur in bearing tcftimony to the

concludc that it is more remarkable than that of any othei
race. See likewise Garcia Origen de los Indies, p. 54.

Carteret, who acually measured thermin 1766, they were
found to be from fix feet to fix feet five and seven
inches in height. Phil. Tranf. vol. Ix. p. 22. These,
however, seem to have been the very people whose size
had been rated so high in the year j764; for several of
them had beads and rea baize of the fame kind with what
had been put aboard Captain Wallis's ship, and he na-
turally concluded that they had got there from Mr. By-
ron. Hawkefw. i. In 1767 they were again measured by
M. Bougainville, whose account agrees nearly with that of
Captain Wallis. Voy. 129. To there I shall add a tef-
timony of great weight. In the year 1762, Don Ber-
nardo Ibagnez de Echavarri accompanied the Marquis de
Valdelirios to Buenos Ayres, and residcd there several
years. He is a very intelligent author, andl his reputation
for veracity unimpeached among his countrymen. In
speaking of the country towards the southern extremity of
America, "' By what Indians," fays he, " is it poflefled ?
Not certainly by the fabulous Patagonians, who are sup-
posed to occupy this diftric'. I have from many eye-wit-
neflfes, who have lived among those Indians, and traded much
with them, a true and accurate description of their persons.
They are of the fame flature with Spaniards. I never saw
one who role in height two varas and two or three inches,"
i. e. about 80 or 81.h32 inches Englifl, if Eclavarri
makes his computation according to the vara of Madrid.
Thllis agrees nearly with the measurement of Captain Wal-
lis. Reyno Jeluitico, 238. Mr. Falkner, who resided
as a miflionary forty years in the southern parts of Ame-
rica, fays, that " the Patagonians, or Puclches, arc a large-
bodied people ; but I never heard of that gigantic race which
others have mentioned, though I have seen persons of all the
diffirent tribes of bouthern Indians." Introd. p. 26. M.
Dobrizhoficl-, a Jesuit, who resided eighteen years in Paraguay,

and

and who had seen great numbers of the various tribes
which inhabit the countries situated upon the Straits of
Magellan, confirms, in every point, the tetfimony of his
brother missionary Falkner. Dobrizhoffer enters into some
detail with refpea to the opinions of several authors con-
cerning the flature of the Patagonians. Having mention-
ed the reports of some early travellers with regard to tlic
extraordinary size of some bones found on that coall,
which were supposed to be human; and having endeavoulr-
ed to flevw that there bones belonged to some large marine
or land animal, he concludes, " de hifce offibus crIed

A NTONIO SA.CHIEZ RIBEIRO,a learned and ingeni-

was not introduced from America, but took its rife in Eu-
rope, and was brought on by an epidemical and malignant
disorder. Did I chufe to enter into a disquisition on this
fubjce, which I flould not have mentioned, if it had not
been intimately conneclcd with this part of my inquiries,
it would not be difficult to point out some mistakes with
rcfpcc to the fails upon which he founds, as well as some
errors in the confequcnces which he draws from them. The
rapid communication of this disease from Spain over Eu-
rope, seems however to resemble the progress of an epide-
mic, rather than that of a disease transmitted by infecion.
The firll mention of it is in the year 1493, and before the
year 1497 it had made its appearance in molt countries of
Europo, with such alarming symptoms as rendered it ne-

AS the view which I have given of rude nations is

extremely different from that exhibited by very rc-

fpedable authors, it lma) be proper to produce some of the
many authorities on which I found my dcfcription. The
manners of the lavage tribes in America have never been
viewedl bv persons more capable of observing them with
dlifrelment, tlian the philosophers employed by France and
Spain, in the year i735, to determine the figure of the
earth. M. Bougucr, D. Antonio (d'Ulloa, and D. Jorge
Juan, resided long among the natives of the least civilized
provinces in Peru. M. de la Condamine hlad not only the
fame advantages with them for oblirvation, but, in his
voyage down the MIaragnon, he had an o[)l)ortintity of
infpedting the fate oftlie various nations cfated on its
banks, in its vail course across the continent of South
America. There is a wonderful rcfcmblaince in their ie-
presentation of the characler of the Americans. " They
are all extremely indolent," fays M. Bougucr, " they

are

are 1tupid, they pass whole days fitting in the fame place,
without moving, or speaking a single word. It is not
easy to describe the degree of their indifference for wealth,
and all its advantages, One does not well know what
motive to propose to them, when one would persuade
them to perform any service. It is vain to offer them
money; they answer, that they are not hungry." Voyage
au Perou, p. Io2. " If one confiders them as men, the
narrowness of their underflanding leems to be incompa-
tible with the excellence of the foul. Their imbecility
is so visible, that one can hardly form an idea of them
different from what one has of the brutes. Nothing dif-
turbs the tranquillity of their fouls, equally insensible
to disasters and to prosperity. Though half-naked, they
are as contented as a monarch in his mofi splendid array.
Riches do not attra& them in the smallest degree, and
the authority or dignities to which they may aspire are so
little the objects of their ambition, that an Indian will
receive with the fame indifference the office of a judge
(Alcalde) or that of a hangman, if deprived of the former
and appointed to the latter. Nothing can move or change
them. Interest has no power over them, and they often
refuse to perform a small service, though certain of a
great recompence. Fear makes no impreflion upon them,
and refpe6d as little. Their disposition is so singular, that
there is no method of influencing them,.no means of rous-
ing them from that indifference, which is proof against
all. the endeavours of the wifell pcrlbns; no expedient
which can induce them to abandon that gross ignorance,
or l.ay aside that carelels negligence, which difconccrt the
prudence and disappoint the care of fucl as are attentive
to their welfare." Voyage d'Ulloa, tom. i. 335, 356.

rity; incapable of foresight or of reflcLtion; abaindoning
themselves, whenl under no rcflraint, to a puerile joy,
which they exprcts by frilling abolt, and imnnioderate fits
of laughter ; without objec or design, they pass their life
without thinking, and grow old without advanci,lg be-
vond childhood, of which they retain all the defiets. If
this. dfecription were applicable only to the Indians il some
provinces of Peru, who arc slaves iii every refpecl but the

was occasioned by the ferv ile dependence to which they
are reduced; the example of tile modern Greeks being
proof how far servitude may degrade the human species.
But tile Indians in the millions of the Jesuits, and the fa-
vages who fill enjoy unimpaired liberty, being as limited
in their faculties, not to fay as /lupid as the other, one
cannot observe, without humiliation, that man, when
abandoned to imple i nature, alnd deprived of the advan-
tages resulting from education and society, differs but.little

phical observer, who visited Martinico in i75i, and re-
fidc there fix years, gives the following description of the

Caraibs r
II

Caraibs: " It is not the red colour of their complexion, it
is not the singularity of their features, which constitutes
the chief difference between them and us. It is their ex-
ceffive simplicity; it is the limited degree of their faculties.
Their reason is not more enlightened or more provident
than the inftinac of brutes. The reason of the most gross
peasants, that of the negroes brought up in the parts of
Africa most remote from intercourse with Europeans, is
such that we discover appearances of intelligence, which,
though imperfect, is capable of increase. But of this the
underitanding of Caraibs seems to be hardly susceptible. If
found philosophy and religion did not afford us their light,
if we were to decide according to the firit impression which
the view of that people makes upon the mind, we should
be disposed to believe that they do not belong to the fame
species with us. Their ltupid eyes are the true mirrour of
their fouls ; it appears to be without fundlions. Their in-
dolence is extreme; they have never the leart solicitude
about the moment which is to succeed that which is pre-
sent." Voyage i la Martinique, p. 44, 45. 51. M.
de la Borde, Tertre, and Rochefort, confirm this defcrip-
tion. " The charadceriflics of the Californians," fays P.
Venegas, " as well as of all other Indians, are stupidity
and insensibility; want of knowledge and refletion; in-
conflancy, impetnofity, and blindness of appetite; an ex-
ceffive sloth, and abhorrence of all labour and fatigue; an
excelfive love of pleasure and amusement of every kind,
however trifling or brutal; pusillanimity, and, in fine, a
molt wretched want of every thing which conltitutes the
real man, and render, lilii rational, inventive, tracable,
and useful to himlclf and fbcicty. It is not easy for Euro-
peans, who never were out of their own country, to con-
ceive an adequate idea of thole people: for, even in the
least frequented corners of the globe, there is not a na-
tion so stupid, of fich contracted ideas, and so weak both

ine

in body and mind, as the unhappy Californians. Their
underltanding comprehends little more than what they
fee; abstract ideas, and much less a chain of rcafonilg,
being far beyond their power; io that they 'carce ever
improve their fits ideas, and these are in general falfc,. or
at least inadequate. It is in vain to represent ato them
any future advantages which will result to them from doing
or abitaining from this or that particular immediately
present; the relation of means and ends being beyond
the stretch of their faculties. Nor have they the leatl
notion of pWrfuing fiAch intentions as will procure them-
selves tome future good, or guard them againit future
evils. Their will is proportional to their faculties, and
all their passions move in a very narrow fpherc. Ambi-
tion they have none, and are more desirous of being ac-
counted firong than valiant. The objects of ambition
with us, honour, fame, reputation, tides, pofls, and dif-
tinrtions of superiority, are unknown among themn; so
that this powerful spring of action, the cause of so much
seeming good and real evil in the world, has no power
here. This disposition of mind, as it gives them up to
an amazing languor and laflitude, their lives fleeting away
in a perpetual inacivity and deteitation of labour, so it
likewise induces them to be attracted by the firfl objec
which their own fancy, or the persuasion of another,
places before them; and at the fane time renders them as
prone to alter their resolutions with the fame facility.
They look with indifference upon any kindlnefs done
them; nor is even the bare remembrance of it to be cx-
peted from thlem. In a word, the unhappy mortals may
be compared to children, in whom the. developemcnt ol
reason is not completed. They may indeed be called a
nation who never arrive at manhood." Hill. of Cali-

that negroes from all the different provinces of Africa are

scribing, retained them; and even their intercourse with
the Spaniards has not been able to root them out. When
twins are born in any family, it is flill confidered as an
ominous event, and the parents have recourse to rigorous
ads of mortification, in order to avert the calamities with
which they are threatened. When a child is born with
any deformity, they will not, if they can pollibly avoid it,
bring it to be baptized, and it is with difficulty they can

be

cufe me of exaggeration: but I can affirm, that it is
as difficult to count them, as to count the sands ot
the banks of that river. One may judge of their num-
ber by the amazing consumption of them ; for all the na-
tions contiguous to the river, and even many who are
at a distance, flock thither at the season of breeding, and
not only find sustenance during that time, but carry off
vast quantities both of the turtles and of their eggs, &c."

REM ARKABLE instances occur of the calamities which

rude nations susser by famine. Alvar Nugnez Ca-

beca de Vaca, one of the most gallant and virtuous of the
Spanish adventurers, resided almost nine years among the
savages of Florida. They were unacquainted with every
species of agriculture. Their subsistence was poor and
precarious. " They live chiefly (fays he) upon roots of
different plants, which they procure with great difficulty,
wandering from place to place in search of them. Some-
times they kill game, sometimes they catch fish, but in
such small quantities, that their hunger is so extreme as
compels them to eat spiders, the eggs of ants, worms,
lizards, serpents, a kind of unatuous earth, and I am per-
fuaded, that if in this country there were any stones, they
would swallow there. They preserve the bones of filhes
and serpents, which they grind into powder, and cat.
The only season when they do not susser much from fa-
mine, is when a certain fruit, which he calls Tunas, is
ripe. This is the fame with the Opuntia, or prickly pear,
of a reddifl and'yellow colour, with a sweet insipid tafle.
They arc sometimes obliged to travel far from their usual
place of residence, in order to find them." Naufragias,

EW HOLLAND, a country which formerly was
only known, has lately been visited by intelligent

observers. It lies in a region of the globe where it
must enjoy a very favourable climate, as it stretches from
the ioth to the 38th degree of northern latitude. It is of
great extent, and from its square form must be much
more than equal to all Europe, The people who inha-
bit the various parts of it appear to be of one race.
They are evidently ruder than most of the Americans,
and have made flill less progress in improvement and the
arts of life. ThWre is not the least appearance of culti-
yation in any part of this vail region. The inhabitants
are extremely few, fp that the country appears almost
desolate. Their tribes are tfill more inconsiderable than
those of America. They depend for fubfiflence, almost
entirely, on fishing. They do not fettle in one place,
but roam about in quest of food. Both sexes go Itark-
naked. Their habitations, utenfls, &c. are more simple
and rude than those of the Americans. Voyages, by
Jlawkefworth, iii, 622, &c. This, perhaps, is thecoun-
try where mnan has been discovered in the earliet stage of

ors, the comparison of the manners of its inhabitants
with those of the Americans will prove an inftruaive ar-
ticle in -the hiitory of the human species.

the face of the country: " We have marched twelve days
without meeting a single human creature. Sometimes we
found ourselves in vait meadows, of which we could not
fee the boundaries, through which there flowed many
brooks and rivers, but without any path to condua us.
Sometimes we were obliged to open a passage across thick
foreits, through bulhes, and underwood filled with briars
and thorns. Sometimes we had to pass through deep
marshes, in which we funk up to the middle. After being
fatigued through the day, we had the earth for our bed, or
a few leaves, exposed to the wind, the rain, and all the
injuries of the air. Lettr. Edifiantes, ii. 360. Dr.

E STRONGLY fufpet that a community of goods, and

an undividcd store, are known only among the rudest

tribes of hunters; and that as soon as any species of agri-
culture or regular industry is known, the idea of an ex-
clufive right of property t6 the fruits ds them is intro-
duced. I am confirmed in this opinion by accounts which
I have received concerning the state of property amtong
the Indians in very diffet'ert regions of America. " The
idea of the natives of Brasil concerning property is, that
if any person cultivate a field, he alone ought to en-
joy the produce of it, and no other has a title to pretend
so it. If an individual or family go a hunting or fish.
ing, what is caught belongs to the individual or t6 the
family, and they communicate no part of it to any but to
their cazique, or to such of their kindred as happen to be
ihdifpofed. If any person in the village come to their
hut, he may fit down freely, and eat withdut asking
liberty. Bnt this is the consequence of their general
principle of hospitality; for I never observed ar)y parti-
tion of the increase of their fields, or the produce of
the chace, which I could confider as the result of any
idea concerning a community of goods. On the contrary,
they ate so much attached to what they deen to be their
property, that it would be extremely dangerous to en-
croach upon it. As far as I have seen, or can learn,
there is not one tribe of Indians in South America, among
whom that community of goods which has been so highly
extolled is known. Tile circumflanice in the govern-
ment of the Jefiits, molt irkfomec to the Indians of Pa-
raguay, was the community of goods which those fathers
iitrodutced. This was repugnant to the original ideas

14- of

of the Indians. They were acquainted with the rights
of private exclusive property, and they submitted with
impatience to regulations which destroyed them." M.
]e Cheval. de Pinto, MS. penes hie. " Atual posses-
sion (fays a miflionary who resided several years among
the Indians of the Five Nations) gives a right to the foil,
but whenever a possessor fees fit to quit it, another has as
good right to take it as he who left it. This law, or
custom, refpeas not only the particular spot on which he
ercts his house, but also his planting-ground. If a man
has prepared a particular spot of ground, on which he
designs in future to build or plant, no man has a right
to incommode him, much leEs to the fruit of his labours,
until it appears that he voluntarily gives up his views.
But I never heard of any formal conveyance from one In-
dian to another in their natural slate. The limits of
every canton is circumscribed; that is, they are allowed to
hunt as far as such a river on this hand, and such a
mountain on the other. This area is occupied and im-
proved by individuals and their families. Individuals,
not the community, have the use and profit of their own
lab6urs, or success in hunting." MS. of Mr. Gideon
Hawley, penes wile.

H E description of the political ifate of the people of

Cinaloa perfecly resembles that of the inhabitants

of North America. " They have neither laws nor kings
(fays a missionary who resided long among them) to pu-
nifh any crime. Nor is there among them any species
of authority, or political government, to restrain them
in any part of their conduct. It is true, that they ac-
knowledge certain Caziques, who are heads of their fa-
milies or villages, but their authority, appears chiefly in
war, and the expeditions against their enemies. This
authority the Caziques obtain not by hereditary right, but
by their valour in war, or by the power and number of
their families and relations. Sometimes they owe their
pre-eminence to their eloquence in displaying their own
exploits." Ribas Hiftor. de las Triumph. &c. p. IX.
The state of the Chiquitos in South America is nearly the
fame. " They have no regular form of government, or
civil life, but in matters of public concern they lifen
to the advice of their old men, and usually follow it.
The dignity of Cazique is not hereditary, but conferred
according to merit, as the reward of valour in war. The
union among them is imperfeEt. Their society resembles
a republic without any head, in which every man is
mailer of himself, and, upon the lcaft disgust, feparatcs
from those with whom he seemed to be conne6ted." Rc-
lacion Hiforical de las Mifliones de los Chiquitos, por P.
Juan Patr. Fernandez, p. 32, 33. Thus, under very dif-
ferent climates, when nations are in a finilar slate of
focicty, their inilitutions and civil government assume
the fame form.

AS the ideas of the North Americans with refpcc to

the mode of carrying on war, are generallyI known;

I have founded my observations chiefly upon the tcltimrony
of the authors who describe them. But the fame maxims
took place among other nations in the New World. A
judicious missionary has given a view of the military ope-
rations of the people in Gran Chaco, in South America,
perfecely similar to those of the Iroquois. " They are
much addiaed to war (fays he), which they carry on fre-
quently among themselves, but perpetually againit the Spa-
niards. But they may rather be called thieves, than lol-
diers, for they never make head against the Spaniards,
unless when they can assault them by stealth, or have
guarded againfi any mischance by spies, who may be called
indefatigable; they will watch the settlements of the Spa-
niards for one, two, or three years, observing by night
every thing that passes with the utmost solicitude, whe-
ther they may expect refiltance or not, and until they arc
perfectly secure of the event, they will not venture upon
an attack; so that when they do give the assault, they are
certain of filccefs, and free from all danger. There spies,
in order that they may not be observed, will creep on
all-four like cats in the night; but if they are discovered,
make their escape with much dexterity. But, although
they never chuie to face the Spaniards, if they be fur-
rounded in any place, whence they cannot escape, they
will fight with desperate valour, and fell their lives very
dear." Lozano Ddfcrip. del Gran Chaco, p. 78.

Spaniards were reduced to such extreme diflrefs by fa-
mine, that, in order to preserve their own lives, they cat
such of their companions as happened to die. This ap-

But he saved his life by extraordinary efforts of courage
and address. De Bry, iii. p. 34, &c. M. De Lery,

E VEN in the rrot intelligent writers concerning the

manncrs of the Americans, one meets with inconfift-

ent and inexplicable circumflances. The Jesuit Charlevoix,
who, in consequence of the controversy between his order
and that of the Franciscans, with refpecl to the talents and
abilities of the North Americans, isdifpofed to represent their
intellectual as well as moral qualities in the molt favourable
light, asserts, that they are engaged in continual nogocia-
tions with their neighbours, and conduct these with lle
molt refined address. At the fame time he adds, " that it
behoves their envoys or plenipotentiaries to exert their abi-
lities and eloquence, for if the terms which they offer arc
not accepted of, they hlad need to stand on their'guard. It
frequently happens, that a blow with a hatchet is the only
return given to their propositions. The envoy is not ollt
ps danger even if he is so fortunate as to avoid the fllule,
he may cxpect to be purfiled, and if taken, to bce brit."

N D. BERNALDES, the contemporary and friend of
Columbus, has prcfervcd some circumflances concern-

ing the bravery of the Caribbces, which are not mentioned
by Don Ferdinand Columbus, or the other hiflorians of
that period, vwlofe works have been publilhed. A Carib-
bean canoe with four imen, two women, and a boy, fell
in unexpcctedly with tih fleet of Columbus in his second
voyage, as it was fleering through their islands. At firfl,
they were firuck alrnolt llopid with aflonifhiment at such a
Ilrange rf)clqacle, and hardly moved from the spot for above
an hour. A Spanli bark, v/ith twenty-five men, ad-

vanced

vanced towards them, and the fleet gradually surrounded
them, so as to cut off their communication with the shore.
"When they saw that it was impoflible to elcape (savs
the historian), they seized their arms with undaunted re-
folu.ion, and began the attack. 1 use the expreflion, with
undaunted re/olulion, for they were few, and beheld a vast
number ready to afault them. They wounded feveil of
the Spaniards, although they ha.d targets, as well as other
defensive armour ; and even after their canoe was overfct,
it was with no little (lifhculty and danger that part of them
were taken, as they continued to defend themselves, and
to ufc their bows with great lcexterity while fwimmiHng in
the tea." Hilf. de D. Fern. y Yfab. MSS. c. II 9.

NOTE LXIX. p. 230.
A PROBABLE conjclure may be formed with refpet

to the cause of the diflinction in character between

the Caribbces and the inhabitants of the larger islands. The
former appear manifeftly'to be a separate race. Their lan-
guage is totally different from that of their neighbours in
the large islands. They themnfeves have a tradition, that
their ancellors came originally from Tome part of the con-
tinent, and having conquered and exterminated the an-
cient inhabitants, took pofleffion of their lands, and of
their women. Rochiefort, 384. Tertre, 360. Hence
they call thenfelves Bannri'e, which signifies a man come
from beyond sea. Labat. vi. 131. Accordingly, the
Caribbees ilill use two diftint languages, one peculiar to
the men, and the other to the women. Tertrc, 361. 'The
language of the men has nothing common with that Ipoken
in the large islands. The dialedt of the women conidcler-
ably resembles it. Labat. 29. This firongly coniliiris
the tradition which I have mcntioned. The Caribl-tt c

thiciiiuclc iS

themselves imagine, that they were a colony from the Ga-
hbis, a powerful na:ion of Guiana, in Southl America.
Terter, 361. Roclhctfrt, 348. But as their fierce man-
ners approach nearer to thole oi the people in tile northern
continent, than to tlofe of the natives of South America;
and as their language has likewise some affinity to that
spoken in Florida, their origin filuild be deduced rather
from the former than from the latter. Labat. 128, &c.

U R knowledge of the events which happened in the
cGnqlueft of New Spain, is derived from sources of

information more original and authentic than that of any
tranfacEion in the hillory of America. The letters of Cor-
tes to the Emperor Charles V. are an hiflorical monument,
not only firfi in order of time, b!t of the greatest authen-
ticity and value. As Cortes early aliinecd a command in-
dependent of Velafiluez, it becCamne nccclfary to convey
f;ich an account of his operationls o Mddiid, as might prp-
cure hiii the approbation of his iuvercign.

TirI. firfl of his lifpatcls has inever heen made public.

It was sent from Vera-Cruz, July 16thl, 1519. As I
imagined that it might not rcac!l the Im mperor, until he
arrived in Germany, for whici hec fit- o0u carly in tlhe year
1520, in order to receive tie ill 'i idl cro!wn; I made
diligent search for a copl of t!ii;; diip..lcl, bhotli in Spain
and ini Germrany, but witr!lo.it ltc1ii. 'I'lis, however, is

Spain. But, in searching for the letter from Cortes, a
copy of one from the colony of Vera-Cruz to the Emperor
has been discovered in the Imperial library at Vienna. Of
this I have subjoined some account at the close of the Notes
to the third volume. The second dispatch, dated October
30th, 1520, was published at Seville, A. D. 1522, and
the third and fourth soon after they were received. A La-
tin translation of them appeared in Germany, A. D. 1532.
Ramufio soon after made them more generally known, by
inserting them in his valuable colletion. They contain a
regular and minute history of the expedition, with many
curious particulars concerning the policy and manners of
the Mexicans. The work does honour to Cortes; the
style is simple and perspicuous ; but as it was manifefily
his interelt to represent his own actions in the fairest light,
his viEtories are probably exaggerated, his losses dimi-
nifhed, and his acs of rigour and violence somewhat soft-
ened.

THE next in order is the Cronica de la Nueva Efpagna,

by Francisco Lopez de Gomara, published A. D. 1554.
Gomara's historical merit is considerable. His mode of
narration is clear, flowing, always agreeable, and some-
times elegant. But he is frequently inaccurate and credu-
lous; and as he was the domeffic chaplain of Cortes after
his return from New Spain, and probably composed his
work at his desire, it is manifest that he labours to magnify
the merit of his hero, and to conceal or extenuate fucli
tranfaflions as were unfavourable to his charaEcer. Of
this Herrcra accuses him in one inflance, Dec. ii. lib. iii.
c. 2. and it is not once only that this is conspicuous. I-e
writes, however, with so much freedom concerning several
meafires of the Spanish court, that the copies both of his
Iifloria de las Indias, and of his Cronica, were called il
by a decree of the council of the Indies, and they were

0o;s,

long confidered as prohibited books in Spain; it is only of
late that licence to print them has been granted. Pinelo
Biblioth. 589.

THE Chronicle of Gomara induced Bernal Diaz del

Castillo to compose his I-iftoria Verdadera de la Conquifla
de la Nueva Efpagna. He had been an adventurer iWeach
of the expeditions to New Spain, and was the compahion
of Cortes in all his battles and perils. When lie found
that neither he himself, nor many of his fellow-foldicrs, were
once mentioned by Gomara, but that the fame of all their
exploits was ascribed to Cortes ; the gallant veteran laid
hold of his pen with indignation, and composed his true
history. It contains a prolix, minute, confused narrative
of all Cortes's operations, in such a rude vulgar flyle as
might be expeced from an illiterate soldier. But as he
relates tranfadions of which he was witness, and in which
he performed a considerable part, his account bears all the
marks of authenticity, and is accompanied with such a plea-
sant naivele, with fucl interefiing details, with such amuf-
ing vanity, and yet so pardonable in an old soldier who had
been (as he boafis) in a hundred and nineteen battles, as
renders his book one of the molt singular that is to be found
in any language.

PET. Martyr ab Angleria, in a treatise de Infulis nupcr

inventis, added to his Decades de Rebus Oceanicis & Novo
Orbe, gives some account of Cortes's expedition. But lhe
proceeds no farther than to relate what happened after his
firfl landing. This work, which is brief and light, fecens
to contain the information tranlinittcd by Curtes in hil
first dispatches, embellifllcd with fcvcral particulars cim-
municated to the author b)v tihe officers whlo brought the
letters from Cortes.

B1 uI

BUT the book to which the greater part of modern his-

torians have had recourse for information concerning tie
conquest of New Spain, is Hiltoria de la Conqllilta (e
Mexico, por D. Antonio de Solis, firfl priblifhed A. D.
1684. I know no author in any language whose literary
fame has risen so far beyond his real merit. Dc Solis is
reckoned by his countrymlen one of the p!ireft writers in
the Castilian tongue; and if a foreigner may venture to
give Ins opinion concerning a matter of which Splaniari:s
alone are qualified to judge, he is intitled to that praile,
But, though his language be correct, his talle in conlpofition
is far from being just. His periods are so lmuch labourcd as
to be often ftifl, and fomnctimes tumid ; the figures whlich
he employs by way of ornament, are trite or inproper,
-nd his observations superficial. These blcmiflies, how-
ever, might eafiiv be overlooked, if he were not defeaive
with refipea to all the great qualities of aln hiflorian. Dcf-
titute of that patient induflry in research, whlich condues
to the knowledge of truth ; a firanger to that impar-
tiality which weighs evidence with cool attention; and
ever eager to establish his favourite fylleln of exalting the
charaaer of Cortes into that of a pc!-sec lieroi exempt
from error, and adorned with every virtue; lie is less so-
licitous to discover what was true, than to relate what
might appear splendid. When he attempts any critical
dificufion, his reafonisigs are fallacious, and founded upon an
imperfect view of sass. Though he sometimes quotes o tes
difJpiaces of Cortes, he fecnms not to have confilted them ;
and though he sets out with some ccrniflr on Gomnara, lie
frequently prefers his antlhority, thl: rntifl doubtful of aliv,
to that of the other coitemIurvr !:ifhi:ianis.

of the evidence before him with so much impartiality and

ing to relate the various occurrences in the New World
in a firit chronological order, the arrangement of evcnril

ed, and obscure, that it is an iuliplcaifant talk to coll:i'- froml

IN those different conflifts, the Spaniards loft only two

men, but had a considerable number wounded. Though

there be no occasion for recourse to any fipcrnatural caufle
to account either for the greatrices of their victorics, or the
smallness of their loss; the Spanifil hiflorians fail not to
ascribe both to the patronage of St. Jago, the tutelar
Saint of their country, who, as they relate, fought at the
head of their countrymen, and by his prowess gave a turn

toJ

to the fate of the battle. Gomara is the first who men-
tions this apparition of St. James. It is amusing to observe
the embarrassment of B. Diaz de Castillo, occasioned by
the struggle between his superstition and his veracity. The
former disposed him to believe this miracle, the latter re-
strained him from attesting it. " I acknowledge, fays he,
that all our exploits and victorics arc owing to our Lord
[efus Christ, and that in this battle there was such a num-
ber of Indians to every one of us, that if each had thrown
a handful of earth they might have buried us, if by the
great mercy of God we had not been proteced. It may
be that the person whom Gomara mentions as having ap-
peared on a mottled grey horses was the glorious apostle
Signor San Jago or Signor San Pedro; and that I, as
being a finner, was not worthy to fee him. This I know,
that I saw Francifca de Morla on such a horse, but as an
unworthy transgressor, did not deserve to fee any of the
holy apostles. It may have been the will of God, that it
was so as Gomara relates, but until I read his Chronicle I
:iever heard among any of the conquerors that such a thin
had happened." Cap. 34.

ageinst tile Spaniards. As the war witb the Tlafcalanss
though of ihort duration, was one of tlhe inof considerable
which tlhe Spaniards waged in America, tle account givel
of the forces of tleir enemies merits some attention. The
only authentic infermation concerning this is derived from
three authors. Cortes, in his second dispatch to t;ic em-
peror, dated at Segura de la lrontera, Oaober 2o, 1520,
thus efilinates the number of their troops; in the firit battle
6000ooo; in the second battle Io,ooo ; in the third battle
i50,ooo. Relat. ap. Ramus. iii. 228. Bernal Diaz del
Caflillo, Awho was an cee-witlefs, and engaged in all tlhe
aciions of this \var, thus reckons their numbcrs; in the
firIt battle 3000, p. 43; in the fccond battle 60o3, ibid.
in the third battle 50,000, p. 45. Gomara, who was
Cortes's chaplain after his return to Spain, and puhlifle(l
his Ci-rciLn in 1552, follows the computation of Cortes,
except in t!he second battle, where he reckons the Tlafca-
lans at 80,000, p. 49. It was manifestly the intcreft of
Cortes to magnify his own dangers and exploits. For it
was only by the merit of extraordinary services, that lid
could hope to atone for his irregular conduct, in ahm;ning
anl independent command. Bern. Diaz, though abundant-
Iv dirpofed to place his own prowess, and that of his fcllow-
conquerorrs, in the most advantageols point of light, liad not
the fnlie temptation to exaggerate ; and, it is probable, that
his at'count of lie numnbers approaches nearer to the truth.
The allclnLlii;g of an a rmy of I50,000 men requires many

THESE unhappy vicimns arc said to be persons of dif-

tinsioon. It fecms improbable that so great a num-

ber as fiftv Ihould be employed as spies. So many prison-
ers had been taken and diliilsced, and the Tlafcalans had
sent so many mesSages to the Spanish quarters, that there
appears to be no rcafon for hazarding the lives of so many
cofidlerable people, in order to procure information about
the position and state of their camp. The barbarous man-
ner in which Cortes treated a people unacquainted with
the laws of war eflablifhed among polished nations, appears
fl shocking to the later Spanish writers, that they diminish
the number of those whom he puniflled so cruelly. Her-
rera savs, that lie cut off the hands of seven, and thumbs
of some more. Dec. ii. lib. ii. c. 8. De Solis relates,
that the hands of fourteen or fifteen were cut off, and tlie
thumbs of all the refi. Lib. ii. c. 20. But Cortes him-

T I1E horses were objecEs of the greatefl aftoniflmcint to

the horse and his rider, like the Centaurs of the ancients,
to be some monfirous animal of a terrible form ; and sup-
posing, that their food was the fame as that of men,
brought flefi and bread to nourish them. Even after they
dil(:overed their miflake, they believed the horses devoured
rlen in battle, and when they neighed, thought that they
wcrc demanding their prey. It was not the interclt of the

Spaniards

Spaniards to undeceive them. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. vi.

ACCORDING to Bart. de las Casas, there was no rea-

son for this massacre, and it was an aft of wanton

cruelty, perpetrated merely to Itrike terror into the people
of New Spain. Relac. de la Deflruyc. p. 17, &c. But
the zeal of Las Casas often leads him to exaggerate. In
opposition to him Bern. Diaz, c. 83, asserts, that the firit
miflionaries sent into New Spail by the emperor, made a
judicial inquiry into this tranfadion; and having examin-
ed the priefis and elders of Cholula, found that there
was a real conspiracy to cut off the Spaniards, and that the
account given by Cortes was exaaly true. As it was the
objea of Cortes at that time, and manifefily his interest,
to gain the good-will of Montezuma, it is improbable, that
he should have taken a tfep which tended so visibly to alie-
nate him from the Spaniards, if he had not believed it to
be necessary for his own preservation. At the fame time,
the Spaniards who served in America had such contempt
for the natives, and thought them so little entitled to the
common rights of men, that Cortes might hold the Cho-
lulans to be guilty upon flight and imperfec evidence.
The severity of the punishment was certainly excessive and
atrocious.

B Diaz del Caflillo gives us some idea of the fatigue

and hardthips they underwent in performing this, and

other parts of duty. During the nine months tlat they
remained in iMexico, every man, -without any difiinaioll
between officers and soldiers, slept on his arms, in his
quilted jacket and gorget; They lay on mats, or straw
spread on the floor, and each was obliged to hold himself
as alert as if he had been on guard. " This, adds he, be-
came so habitual to me, that even now in my advanced
age, I always sleep in my clothes, and never in any bed.
When I visit my Encomienda, I reckon it suitable to my
rank, to have a bed carried along with my other baggage,
but I never go into it; but, according to custom, I lie in
my clothes, and walk fiequently during the night into the
Ppen air, to view the flars as I was wont when in service."

Montezuma in irons. Ramus. iii. 236. B. Diaz is silent
with refpe& to his reasons for the former ; and the only
cause he assigns for the latter was, that he might meet
with no interruption in executing the sentence pronounced
against Qualpopoca, c. xcv. p. 75. But as Montezuma
was his prisoner, and absolutely in his power, he had no
reason to dread him, and the insult offered to that monarch
could have no effect but to irritate him unncceffarily. Go-
mara supposes, that Cortes had no other object than to oc-
cupy Montezuma with his own diflrefs and sufferings, that
le might give lecs attention to what besel Qualpopoca.
Cron. c. 89. -Icrrera adopts the fame opinion. Dec. ii.
lib. viii. c. 9. But it seems an odd expedient, in order to
make a perlon bear one injury, to load him with another
that is greater. De Solis imagines, that Cortes had no-
thing else in view than to intimidate Montezuma, so that
he might make no attempt to rcfcue the viceims from their
fate; but tile spirit of that monarch was so submissive, and
he had so tamely given up the priloners to the disposal of
Cortes, that he had no cause to apprehend any opposition
fron him. If the explanation which I have attempted to
give of Cortes's proceedings on this occasion be not admit-
ted, it appears to me, that they mull. be reckoned among
the wanton and barbarous ads of oppreflion which occur
too often in the hifory of the conqueit of America.

NOTE LXXXV. p.315.
Dl E Solis asserts, lib. iv. c. 3. that the proposition of

doing homlage to the King of Spain, came from

Montezuma himself, and was made in order to induce the
Spaniards to depart out of hi! dominions. He decfribes
his condudt on tils occasion, as if it had been loulndd upon
a fchcme of profound policy, and executed with fucli re-

I i 4 fined

fined address, as to deceive Cortes himself. But there is no
hint or circumstance in the contemporary historians, Cor-
tes, Diaz, or Gomara, to juitify this theory. Montezu-
lna, on other occasions, discovered no such extent of art
and abilities. The anguish which he felt in performing
this humbling ceremony is natural, if we suppose it to
have been involuntary. But, according to the theory of
De Solis, which supposes that Montezuma was executing
what he himself had proposed, to have assumed an appear-
ance of sorrow, would have been preposterous and incon-
fidtent with his own design of deceiving the Spaniards.

NOTE LXXXVI. p. 318.
IN several of the provinces, the Spaniards, with all their

industry and influence, could collEt no gold. In

others, they procured only a few trinkets of small value.
Montezuma assured Cortes, that the present which he of-
sered to the King of Castile, after doing homage, consisted
of all the treasure amassed by his father; and told him,
that he had already distributed the rcft of his gold and
jewels among the Spaniards. B. Diaz, c. Io4. Gomara
relates, that all the silver colle&ed amounted to 500 marks.
Cron. c. 93. This agrees with the account given by
Cortes, that the royal fifth of silver was 100 marks. Re-
lat. 239, B. So that the fum total of silver was only
4000ooo ounces, at the rate of eight ounces a mark, which
demonfirates the proportion of silver to gold to have been
exceedingly small.

NOTE LXXXVII. p. 39.
D E Solis, lib. iv. c. i. calls in quetlion the truth of

this tranfadtion, from no better reason than that it

was inconsistent with that prudence which distinguishes the
charaaer of Cortes. But lie ought to have recolleaed
the impetuosity of his zeal at Tlafcala, which was no lets
imprudent. He allerts, that the evidence for it refts upon
the testimony of B. Diaz del Castillo, of Gomara, and of
Herrera. They all concur indeed, in mentioning this in-
considerate flep which Cortes took; and they had good
reason to do so, for Cortes himself relates this exploit in
his second dispatch to the Emperor, and seems to glory in
it. Cort. Relat. Ramus. iii. 140, D. This is one in-
itance, among many, of De Solis's having consulted with
little attention the letters of Cortes to Charles V. from
which the moit authentic information with refpet to his
Operations must be derived.

NOTE LXXXVIII. p. 323.

E R RERA and Dc Solis suppose, that Velasquez
was encouraged to equip this armament againfl Cor-

tes, by the accounts which lie received from Spain con-
cerning the reception of the agents flnt by the colony of
Vera Cruz, and the warmth with which Fonseca bishop of
Burgos had efpoured his interelt, and condemned the pro-
ceedings of Cortes. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 18. De
Solis, lib. iv. c. 5. But the chronological order of events
refutesthis supposition. Portocarrero and Montcjo failed
from Vera Cruz, July 26, 15o1. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. v.
c. 4. They landed at St. Lucar in Octobcr, according to

:lrci i',

lIcrrera, ibid. But P. Martyr, who attcinded the court
at that time, and comniuicated every occurrence of mlo-
InInt to his correfpoiidents day by dav, mentions the arri-
xal of thelf agents, for the first time, in December, and
speaks of it as a recent event. Eplifl. 650. All thelif-
torians agree, that the agents of Cortes had their firlt au-
dience of the Emperor at Tordefillas, when lie went to
ihat town to visit his mothler in his way to St. Jago de
Compoftella. Iierrera, dec. ii. lib. v. c. 4. De Solis,
lib. iv. c, 5. But the emperor set out from Valladolid
for Tordefillas, on the Itlh of Miarch 52o ; and P. Mar-
tyr mentions his having fen at that time the prefnts made
to Charles, Epifl. 1665. The arnlilent unrder Narvaez
{ailed from Cuba in April 1520. It is Ianifelt[ then, that
Velasquez could not receive any account of what palsed in
this interview at Tordefillas, previous to his hloftile pre-
parations against Cortes. His real motives seem to be
those which I have mentioned. The patent appointing
him Adelantldo of New Spain, wit fuh f cxtcnfive powers,
bears date November 13, 15I9. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. iii.
c. i . I-Ie might receive it about the beginning of Janu-
ary. Gomara takes notice, that as soon as this patent war
delivered to him, he began to equip a fleet and lcvy forces.
Cron. c. 96.

NOTE LXXXIX. p. 326.
TFl. Solis contends, that as Narvaez had no interpreters,

he could hold no intcrcourfe with the people of the

provinces, nor converle with them in any way but by signs,
and that it w.s equally impoflible for himi to carry on any
comnlunication witl j\lontczunii. Lib. iv. c. 7. But it
is upon the atthlirily of Cortes liinilulf that I relate all tih
particulars of Narvi.cz's corrcrpolldcncc, both witl Mon-

tcz.uLln

(ezuma and with his subjeCts in the maritime provinces.
Relat. Ramus. iii. 244, A. C. Cortes affirms, that there
was a mode of intcrcouric between Narvaez and the Mexi-
cans, but does not explain how it was carried on. Bernal
Diaz supplies this defer, and infbrms us, that the three
deserters who joined Narvaez ated as interpreters, having
acquired a competent knowledge of the language, c. IIo.
With his usual minuteness, he mentions their names and
charaaters, and relates, in chapter 122, how they were
punishcd for their perfidy. The Spaniards had now resided
above a year among the Mexicans; and it is not surprising,
that several among them should hlave made some proficiency
in speaking their language. This fcems to have been the
cafe. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. x. c. I. Both B. Diaz, who
was prcfcnt, ai.' I ecrrera, the mnoft accuiate and best inform-
ed of all the Spa!iilh writers, agree with Cortes in his account
of the fecrct ccrrefpondence carried on with Montezuma.
Dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 18, 19. Dc Solis seems to confider it
as a dilcredit to Cortes, his hero, that Montezuma Ihould
have been ready to engage in a corrcfpondencc with Nar-
vacz. He supposes that monarch to have contracted such
a vwonderful afTcLion for thle Spaniards, that he was not
foicitous to 1;e delivered from them. After the indignity
wVi:i whicli lie had been treated, such an affetion is incre-
dible ; and even Dc Solis is obliged to acknowledge, that
it i;aull l oolked upon as one of the miracles which God
had wrullght to facilitate the conquefi, lib. iv. c. 7. The
truth is, Montczuna, lhowever much overawed by his
dread of the Spaniards, was extremely impatient to recover
his liberty,

THESE words I have borrowed from the anonymnou:

Account of the European Settlements in America,

published by Dodfley, in two volumes, 8vo. a work of fu
much merit, that I should think there is hardly any writes
in the age who ought to be ashamed of acknowledging
himself to be the author of it.

NOTE XCI. p. 350.
THE contemporary historians differ considerably with

refpeEt to the loss of the Spaniards on this occasion.

Cortes, in his second dispatch to the emperor, makes the
number only 15o. Relat. ap. Ramus. iii. p. 249, A.
But it was manifefily his interest, at that junture, to
conceal from the court of Spain the full extent of the loss
which he had sustained. De Solis, always fludious to
diminish every misfortune that besel his countrymen,
rates their loss at about two hundred men. Lib. iv. c. 19.
B. Diaz affirms, that they loft 870 men, and that only
440 escaped from Mexico, c. 128. p. io8, B. Palafox,
bishop of Los Angeles, who seems to have inquired into
the early tranfraions of his countrymen in New Spain,
with great attention, confirms the account of B. Diaz,
with rerpecd to the extent of their loss. Virtudcs del In-
dio, p. 22. Gomara flates their loss at 450 men. Cron.
c. 109. Some monilis afterwards, whcn Cortes had re-
ceived several reintforccnents, hle muflered his troops,
and found them to be only 590. Rclat. ap. Raiulf. iii.
p. 255, E. Now, as Narvacz brought 880 men iinto
New Spain, and about 400 of Cortes's lbldiers were

17 thlcn

then alive, it is evident, that his loss, in the retreat from
Mexico, must have been much more considerable than
what he mentions. B. Diaz, solicitous to magnify the
dangers and sufferings to which he and his fellow-con-
querors were exposed, may have exaggerated their loss;
but, in my opinion, it cannot well be estimated at less
than 600 men.

p. 148, b. 149, a. Like a man whose courage was so
clear as to be above suspicion, he deferibes with his usual
simplicity the imprefion which this lipetacle made upon
him. " Before, fays he, I saw the breafls of my com-
paniorls opened, their hearts, yet fluttcring, offered to an
accursed idol, and their flcfh devoured by their exulting
enemies; I was accuflomed to enter a battle not only
without fear, but with high fpilit. But from that time I
never advanced to fight the Mexicans without a fecrct
horror alnd anxiety ; my heart trembled at the thoughts of
the death which I had seen them fuffcr." He takes care

to

to add, that as soon as the combat began, his terror went
off'; and, indeed, his adventurous bravery on every oc-
calion is full evidence of this. B. Diaz, c. 156. p.
157, a.

NOTE XCIV. p. 388.
O NE circumllance in this siege merits particular no-

tice. The account which the Spanish writers give

of the numerous armies employed in the attack or defence
of Mexico, seems to be incredible. According to Cortes
himself, he had at one time 150,000 auxiliary Indians in
his service. Relat. Ramus. iii. 275, E. Gomara as-
fcrts, that they were above 200,co0. Cron. c. 136.
Herrera, an author of higher autlihority, fays, they were
about 200,000. Dec. iii. lib. i. c. 19. None of thc
contemporary writers ascertain explicitly the number of
persons in IMexico during the siege. But Cortes on fc-
vcral occasions mentions tle numnbcr of Mexicans who
were slain, or who perillcld for want of food ; and, if
we may rely on tlhofe circumtllances, it is probable, that
above two undred(lic thoufanld null have been fllut up in
the town. But the quantilt of provisions ncceffary for
the fulfiilltce of fuctli va.il Inmultitudcs afrlnibled in one
place during thrce mouniu!l, is so great, and it requires so

B. Diaz, p. 142. Cortes Relat. 271, D. Cortes on
one occasion mentions slightly the fubfilence of his army;
and after acknowledging, that they were often in great
want, adds, that they received supplics from the people
of the country, of fill, and of some fruit, which he calls
the cherries of the country. Ibid. B. Diaz fays, that
they had cakes of maize, and cerafas de la tierra; and
when the season of thece was over, another fruit, which
he calls Tuioes; but their inofl comfortable fu!filtencc
was a root which ihe Indians use as food, to which he
gives the name of i/7ilites, p. 142. T'he Indian auxi-
liarics had one means of fubfillence more than the Spa-
niards. They fed lupon the bodies of the Mexicans who;n
they killed in battle. Cort. Relat. I76, C. B. Diaz
confirms his relation, and adds, that when the Indialr.
returned from Mlexico to tlicir own cotlnttry, they cai-
ried with them large quantities of the flchl of the Mexi-
cans salted or dried, as a inofl acceptabit prefclt to their
friends, that they might lhave the plcafiire of fcelding
upon the bodies of their cnemies in their feltivals. P. 157.
Dc Soils, who seems to confider it as an imniittation of
discredit to his countrymen, that tlhey Itould aCt in con-
cert withl auxiliaries who fedl lipon' human Tlelh, is soli-
citous to prove, that tlhe Sp;ani;;rs cInlcavoIecd to pre-
vent their aflociates from cating the bodies of the Mexi-

B. Diaz, feemn to huve hld any l'ti:lh ftrpi)le ; and, on
many occasions, riention tl:e Indian rc1fls, whichl were

Even withl thlis addltititl llock of food for tlhe Indians, it
was hardly pofrille to procure ni hbi ifnce for arnies anmount-
ing to fucli nuiIIlers as :we liil in tle Spanish writers.
Perhaps tlhe bcft li!;iuon of the difliculI is, to adopt the

I I opiniun

opinion of B. Diaz del Castillo, the most artless of all the
Hfaoriadores primitivs. " When Gomara (fays he), on
some occasions, relates, that there were so many thouland
Indians our auxiliaries, and on others, that there were so
many thousand houSes in this or that town, no regard is to be
paid to his enumeration, as he has no authority for it, the
numbers not being in reality the fifth of what he relates.
If we add together the different numbers which he men-
tions, that country would contain more millions than there
are in Castile." C. 129. But though some considerable
deduction should certaihly be made from the Spanifl ac-
counts of the Mexican forces, they muff have been very
numerous; for nothing but an immense superiority in
number could have enabled them to withfland a body of
nine hundred Spaniards, conducted by a leader of such abi-
lities as Cortes.

NOTE XCV. p. 405.
IN relating the oppressive and cruel proceedings of the

conquerors of New Spain, I have not followed B. de

las Casas as my guide. His account of them, Rclat. de
la Deftruyc. p. 8, &c. is manifelly exaggerated. It is
from the testimony of Cortes himself and of Gomara,
who wrote under his eye, that I have taken my account
of the punifhmcnt of the Panucans, and they relate it
without any disapprobation. B. Diaz, contrary to his
usual cufloml, mentions it only in general terms, c. 162.
Herrera, o(licitous to extenuate this barbarous action of
his countrymen, though lie mentions 60 caziques, and
400 men of notc, as being condemned to the flames,
asserts, that thirty only were burnt, and the reft par-
doned. Dcc. iii. lib, v. c. 7. But this is contrary to

tlhe

the teftimoriy of the original historians, particularly of
Gomara, whom it appears he had consulted, as he adopts
several of his expressions in this passage. The punishment
of Guatimozin is related by the most authentic of the
Spanish writers. Torquemada has extracted from a
history of Tezeuco, composed in the Mexican tongue, an
account of this tranfaftion, more favourable to Guati-
mozin than that of the Spanish authors. Mon. Indiana, i.
575. Accdrding to the Mexican account, Cortes had
scarcely a thadow of evidence to justify such a wanton
aft of cruelty. B. Diaz affirms, that Guatimozin and
his fellow-fufferers asserted their innocence with their last
breath, and that many of the Spanish soldiers condemned
this action of Cortes as equally unnecessary and unjut,
p. 200, b. 2o1, a.

NOTE XCVI. p. 408.
T H E motive for undertaking this expedition was, to

punish Chriftoval de Olid, one of his officers, who

had revolted against him, and aimed at eflablilhing
an independent jurifdition. Cortes regarded this in-
furrecion as of such dangerous example, and dreaded
so much the abilities and popularity of its author, that
in person he led the body of troops dellined to suppress
it. He marched, according to Gomara, three thou-
sand miles, through a country abounding with thick
forests, rugged mountains, deep rivers, thinly inhabited,
and cultivated only in a few places. What he suffered
from famine, from the holtility of the natives, from the
climate, and from hardships of every species, has nothing
in hillory parallel to it, but what occurs in the adventures

VoL. II. K k of

of the other discoverers and conquerors of the New World.
Cortes was employed in this dreadful service above two
years, and though it was not diftinguiffied by any splendid
event, he exhibited, during the course of it, greater per-
fonal courage, more fortitude of mind, more perseverance
and patience, than in any other period or scene in his
life. Herrera, dec. iii. lib. vi. vii. viii. ix. Gornara
Cron. c. I63-177. B. Diaz, 174-190. Cortes,
MS. penes me. Were one to write a life of Cortes, the
account of this expedition lhould occupy a splendid place
in it. In a general history of America, as the expedition
was productive of no great event, the mention of it is
sufficient.

NOTE XCVII. p. 410.
A CCORDING to Herrera, the treasure which

Cortes brought with him, confined of fifteen hun-

dred marks of wrought plate, two hundred thousand pesos
of fine gold, and ten thousand of inferior flandard, many
rich jewels, one in particular worth forty thousand pesos,
and fcveral trinkets and ornaments of value. Dec. iv.
lib. iii. c. 8. lib. iv. c. i. He afterwards engaged to
give a portion with his daughter of a hundred thousand
pesos. Gomara Cron. c. 237. The fortune which he
left his fonls was very confidcrable. But, as we have be-
fore related, the fiul divided among the conquerors on
ihe first rcdualion of Mexico was very finall. Tllere
appears tlhen to be fume rcafln for fui)pc6ing that the
accusations of Cortes's enemies were not altogether
deflitute of foundation. Tlhey charged limi with hav-
ing applied to his own ife a dif)rol,ortioniiate hare of
illc Mexican spoils; with having c.ml'ealcd tlhe roy.al

t rca't!ct

treasures of Montezuma and Guatimozin; with defraud-
ing the king of his fifth; and robbing his followers
of what was due to them. Herrera, dec. iii. lib. viii.
c. 15. dec. iv, lib. iii. c. 8. Some of the conquerors
themselves entertained suspicions of the fame kind. B.
Piaz, c. 157.
