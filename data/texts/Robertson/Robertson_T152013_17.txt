H AR LES V. was born at. Ghent on the BOOK I.

twenty - fourth day of February, in the Bith of

Philip the Handsome, Archduke of Austria,
was the son of the Emperor Maximilian, and
of Mary, the only child of ,Charles' the Bold,
the last prince of the house of Burgundy. His
mother, Joanna, was the second daughter of
Ferdinand and Isabella, King arid Queen of
Castile and Aragon.

vinces, towards which their profped of fuc-
ceflion was extremely remote. The rich pof-
fefions of Mary of Burgundy were destined for
another family, the having been contraded by
her father to the only son of Louis XI. of
France; but that capricious monarch, indul-
" ging his hatred to her family, chose rather to
fbrip her of part of her territories by force, than

. to secure the whole by marriage; and by this

xnifcondud, fatal to his posterity, threw ·all the
Netherlands and Franche Comt6 into the hands

of Castile, far from having -any profped of that
noble inheritance which fie transmitted to her
grandson, passed the early part of her life in
obfctrity and indigence. But the Caftilians,
exasperated against her brother Henry IV. an
ill-advifed and vicious Prince, publickly charged
him with impotence, and his Queen with adul-.
tery. Upon his demise, rejeding Joanna,
whom the King had uniformly, and even on
his death-bed, owned to be his lawful daughter,
and whom an assembly of the states had ac-
knowledged to be the heir of his kingdom, they
obliged her to retire into Portugal, and placed
Isabella on the throne of Castile. Ferdinand
owed the crown of Aragon to the unexpeded

death of his elder brother, and acquired the Boo0K L
kingdoms of Naples and Sicily by violating the
faith of treaties, and disregarding the ties of
blood. To all these kingdoms, Christopher
Columbus, by an effort of genius and of intre-
pidity, the boldest and most fuccefsful that is
recorded in the annals of mankind, added a new
world, the wealth of which was one confider-
able source of the power and grandeur of the
Spanish monarchs.

DON JOHN, the only son of Ferdinand and Philip and

Joanna, his

Isabella, and their eldest daughter, the' Queen father and
of Portugal, being cut off in the flower ofmo·rer, vi"
youth, all their hopes centered in Joanna and Si"aR
her posterity. But as her husband, the Arch-
duke, was a fitranger to the Spaniards, it was
thought expedient to invite 'him into Spain, that
by residing among them, he might accuftomr
himself to their laws and manners; and it was
expeded that the Cortes, or assembly of states,
whose authority was then so great in Spain, that
no title to the crown was reckoned valid unless
it received their fandion, would acknowledge
his right of fucceflion, together with that of the
Infanta, his wife. Philip and Joanna, passing
through France in their way to Spain, were
entertained in that kingdom with the utmost io .
magnificence. The Archduke did homage to
Louis XII. for the earldom of Slanders, and

BOOK I. took his feat as a ,peer of the realm in the par-

liament of Paris. They were received in Spain
with every mark of honour that the parental
affedion of Ferdinand and Isabella, or the
refped of their fubjels, could devise; and their
title to the crown was soon after acknowledged
by the Cortes of both kingdoms.

Ferlinand BUT amidst there outward appearances of fa-
ehips Of tisfadion and joy, some secret uneasiness preyed
power. upon the mind of each of these princes. The

stately .and reserved ceremonial of the Spanish
court, was so burdensome to Philip, a prince
young, gay, affable, fond of society and of
pleasure, that he soon began to express a desire
of returning to his native country, the manners
of which were more suited to .his temper. Ser-
dinand, observing the declining. health of his
Queen, with whose life his right to the govern-
ment of Castile muff cease, easily foresaw, that
a prince of Philip's disposition, and who already
discovered an extreme impatience to reign,
would never consent to his retaining any degree
of authority in that kingdom; ,and the profpe&
of this diminution of his power, awakened the
jealousy of that ambitious monarch.

was destitute of those beauties of person, as well BOoaK I.
as "thofe accomplishments of mind , which fix.
the affeaions of an husband. Her understand-
ing, always weak, was often disordered. She
doated on Philip with such an excess of childifl
and indiscreet fondness, as excited disgust rather
than affedion. Her jealousy, for which her
hufband's behaviour gave her too much cause,.
was proportioned to her love, and often broke
out in the most extravagant adions. Isabella,
though sensible of her defeds, could not help.
pitying her condition, which was Loon rendered
altogether deplorable, by the Archduke's abrupt
resolution of setting out in the middle of winter
for Slanders, and of leaving her in Spain. Ifa'-
bella intreated him not to abandon his wife to.
grief and melancholy, which might prove fatal
to her, as ihe was near the time of her delivery.
Joanna conjured him to put off his journey for
three days only, that she might have the plea-
Lure of celebrating the festival of Christmas in,
his company. Ferdinand, after representing the
imprudence of his leaving Spain, before he had'
time to become acquainted with the genius, or
to gain the affedions of the people, who were
one day to be his fabjeds, besought him, at
least, not to pass through France , with which
kingdom he was then at open war. Philip,
without regarding either the dicates of hu-
mranity, or the maxims of prudence, persisted,

till the death either of Ferdinand or of Isabella-

The latter of tdiefe events was not far distant.
The untimely, death of her children had made
a deep- impression on the mind of Isabella, and
as ffhe could derive but little consolation for the
losses which the had sustained either from her
daughter Joanna , whdfe infirmities daily in-
creased, or from her fon-in-law, who no longer
preserved even the appearance of a decent re-
spect towards that unhappy princess, her spirits
and health began gradually to decline, and after
languishing some. months, fihe died at Medina del
Campo on the twenty-fixth of November, one

eminent for virtue, than for wisdom; and whe-

high encomiums beflowed. on her by the Spanish

of Regent, in consequence of Ifabella's terfa- BooK I.

Cortes of Castile to acknowledge his right to ledged asre
that office. This, however, he did not procure gent by the
without difficulty, nor without discovering such Cortes
symptoms of alienation and disgust ntmong the The Cafti-
Caftilians as filled him with gre-at uneasiness. ~tiSF.
The union of Castile and Aragon, for almost
thirty years, had not so entirely extirpated the *
ancient and hereditary enmity which subsisted
between the natives of these kingdoms, that the
Castilian pride could submit, without murmur-
ing, to the government of a king of Aragon.
Ferdinand's own charader, with which the
Caftilians were well acquainted, was far from
rendering his authority desirable. Suspicious,
discerning, severe, and parsimonious, he was
accustomed to observe the most minute adions
of his fubjeds with a jealous attention, and to
reward their highest services with little libe-
rality; and they were now deprived of Isabella,
whose gentle qualities, and partiality to her
Castilian fubjeds, often tempered his austerity,
or rendered it tolerable. The maxims of his
government were especially odious to the Gran-
dees; for that artful Prince, sensible of the dan-
gerous privileges conferred upon them by the
feudal institutions, had endeavoured to curb
their exorbitant power z,. by extending the royal

by increasing the immunities of cities, and by
other measures equally prudent. From all these
causes, a formidable party among the Caftilians
united against Ferdinand, and though the per-
tons who composed it, had not hitherto takep.
any publick step in opposition to him, he plain-
ly saw that upon the least ,encouragement from

* their new King they would proceed to the most

violent extremities.

Philip en-' THIERE was no less agitation in the Nether-
deavours to lands Uipon receiving the accounts of Ifabella's

government death, and of Ferdinand's having assumed the
of cadile, government of Castile. Philip was not of a

temper tamely to fuffer himself to be supplanted
by the unnatural ambition of his father-in-law.
If Joanna's infirmities, and the non-age 6f Charles.
rendered them incapable of government, he, as
a husband, was the proper guardian'of his wife,
and as a father , the natural tutor of his son.
Nor was it fufficient to oppose to these juft'
rights, and to the inclination of the people of
Castile, 'the authority of a testament, the ge-
nuinenefs of which was perhaps, doubtful, and
its contents certainly iniquitous. A keener edge
was added to Philip's resentment, and new vi-
gour infused into his councils by the arrival of
Don John Manuel. He was Ferdinand's am-
baffador at the Imperial court, but upon the

first notice of Ifabella's death repaired to Bruf-
,fels, flattering himself, that under, a young
:and liberal prince, he might attain to power
and honours, which he could never hope for
iin the service of an old and frugal master. He
ihad early paid court to Philip during his refi-
ldence in Spain, with such assiduity as entirely
·gained his confidence; and having been trained
to business under Ferdinand, could oppofe'his
schemes with equal abilities, and with arts not

THE conclusion of this match, which deprived BOOK I,

Philip of his only ally, and threatened him with
the loss of so many kingdoms, gave a dreadful
alarm to him, and convinced Don John IVIanuel
|that there was now a necessity of taking other

MHe accordingly inftruded the Flemish ambaffa-

desire which their master had of terminating all

to any conditions that would re-establish the

From every corner of the kingdom, persons of BoOit L
the highest rank, with numerous retinues of
their vassals, repaired to their new King. The
treaty of Salamanca was universally condemned,
and all agreed to exclude from the government
of Castile a prince, who, by consenting to disjoin
Aragon and Naples from that crown, discovered
so little concern for its true interests. Ferdi-
nand, meanwhile, abandoned by almost all the
Caftilians, disconcerted by their revolt, and sun-
certain whether he should peaceably relinquish
his power, or take arms in order to maintain it,
earnieftly solicited an interview with his fon-in-
law, who by advice of Manuel studiously avoided
it. Convinced at last, by feeing the number,

daughter, and by virtue of the testament of
Isabella; the latter thought himself the legal
guardian ofhis grandson, whom, on account of
his mother's infirmity, he already considered as
King of Castile. Such of the nobility as had

* lately been most aftive in compelling Ferdinand

to resign the government of the kingdom, trem-
bled at the thoughts of his being restored so
soon to his former dignity. They dreaded the
return of a monarch, not apt to forgive, and
who, to those defeAs with, which they were al-
ready acquainted, added that resentment which
the remembrance of tIeir behaviour, and reflec-
tion upon his own disgrace, °must naturally have
excited. Though none of these objedions held
against Maximilian, he was a stranger to the
laws and manners of Castile; he had not either
troops, or money to support his pretensions; nor
could his claim be admitted without a public

DoN JOHN MANUEL, however, and a few of

for Maxirni-lian, and offered to support his claim

A FEW days before the death of Philip, Fer-Ferdainr1a

dinand had set out for Naples, that, by his own abe't, on a

presence, he might put an end, with the greater kingdom of
decency, to the vice-royalty of the great captain, Naples.
whose important services, and 'cautious conduct,
did no't screen him 'from the suspicions 6f his
jealous master. Though an account of his son-
in-law's death reached him at Porto-fi-no, in the
territories of Genoa, he was so solicitous to dif-
cover the secret intrigues which he supposed the
great captain to have been carrying on, and, to
establish his own authority on- a firm foundation
in the Neapolitan dominions, by removing him
from the supreme command there, that rather
than discontinue his voyage, he chose to leave
Castile in a state of anarchy, and even to rifque,
by, this delay; his obtaining poffeflion of the

was more apt ot confider that young prince as

hands the government of Castile , than as a
grandson, for whose behoof he was entrusted
with the adminiffration. This jealousy soon
begot aversion, and even hatred , the symptoms

proceeded his immoderate joy when his young
Queen was delivered of a son, whose life would
have deprived Charles of the crowns of Aragon,
Naples, Sicily and Sardinia; and upon the un-
timely death of that prince, he difoovered, for
the fame reason, an excessive solicitude to have
other children. This' impatience hastened , in
all probability, the accession of Charles to the
crown of Spain. Ferdinand , in order to pro-

Ferdinand; for, though he survived a violent
disorder which it at first occasioned, it brought
on such an habitual languor and de,jedioia of
mind, as rendered him averse from any serious
attention to publick affairs, and fond of frivolous
amusements, on which he had not hitherto be-
stowed much time ". Though he now despaired
of having any son of his own, his jealouify of
the Archduke did not abate, nor could he help
viewing him with that aversion, which princes
often bear to their successors. In order to gra- i c .

with his brother; the latter would, in any event,
have, rendered him almost, independent.

FERDINAND retained to the last that jealous

love of power, which was so. remarkable through
his whole life. Unwilling to resign it, even at
the approach of death, he removed continually
from place to place , in order to fly from his
distemper, or to forget it. Though his strength
declined every day, none of his attendants durst
mention his condition; nor would he admit his
father confeffor, who thought such silence cri-
minal and unchristian, into his presence. At
last the danger became so imminent, .that it
could be no longer concealed. Ferdinand re-
ceived the intimation with a decent fortitude.;
and touched, perhaps, with compundtion at the
injustice which he had done his grandson, or
influenced by the honest remonftrances of Car-
vajal, Zapata, and Vargas, his most ancient and
faithful counsellors, who represented to him, that
by inverting prince Ferdinand with the regency,
he would infallibly entail a civil war on the two
brothers,, and by beftowing on him the grand-
mastership of the military orders, would fitrip
the crown of itsnobleft ornament and chief
strength, he consented to alter his will in both

there particulars. By a new deed he left Charles BOOK t.
the sole heir of all his dominions, and allotted i x i6.

which he thought himself almost secure , anwill,

the filter of Edward IV. of England, and widow
of Charles the Bold, two prince'ffes of great
virtue and abilities, had the care of forming his

Flemings committed the government of the Low

than the genius of feudal government, naturally
an enemy to commerce, and to regular police,
seemed :-to. admit. The personal rights, and po.
litical influence, which the inhabitants of these
cities had acquired , were extensive. The royal pre.
rogative , circumscribed by the privileges of the
nobility, and by the pretensions of the people,
was confined within very narrow limits. Unde
.such a form of government, the principles a
discord .were -many; the bond of union wa
extremely feeble; and Spain felt not only al
the inriconveniencies occasioned by the defec
in the feudal system, but was exposed to dif
orders arising. from the peculiarities in its owi
constitution.

DURING the long administration of. Ferdi

Xand, no internal commotion, it is true, had
arisen in Spain,. His superior abilities enable
him to restrain the turbulence of the nobles , an
to moderate the jealousy of the commons. ByI
the wisdom of his domestic government, by thl
.sagacity with which he conduded his foreigi
operations , and by the high opinion that hi

subjects entertained of both , he prefei^ed among took t
them a degree of tranquillity, greater than was 5r 1
'tiatural to a constitution , in which the feeds of
diifcord and disorder were so copiously mingled..
13Butt, iby the death of Ferdinand , there restraints
Waere at once withdrawn; and fadibrin and dif.
6siif.tent: , from beirig long repressed, were ready
to break out with fiercer animosity.

IN order to prevent those evils , Ferdinand Ferdinani

':-had .in his last will taken a most prudent pre.- a apoi
tautioi , by appointing Cardinal Xinxenes, arch- ximenes
fbifhlop of Toledo , to be sole regent of Caftile,regento
L until the arrival of his grandson in Spain; The
i^fingulai- charader of this man, and the elxtra-
|'ordinary qualities which marked him out for
|1That 'office, at such a jiundure, merit a particular
sdefcription. He was descended of an honour- is rife adii4
i

able , hot of a wealthy family ; and the circum-chara~ter

fiances of his parents, as iwell as his oivn incli-
inations , having determined him to enter into
the church, he early obtained benefices of great
" value, and which placed him in the way of the
highest prefermneiit.- All these , however , he rte
' nounced at once; and after undergoing a very

1516i, of fuperfititous devotion, which are the proper

.charaderifties of the monaftick life. But not::
withstanding these extravagances, to which weak!
and enthusiastic minds alone are usually prone i
this umderftanding, naturally penetrating and de-
cifive, retained its full vigour, 5and acquired
lim -such great authority in his own order,
as raised him to be their provincial. His repu-,
tation for fantity loon procured him the office
of father confeffor to Queen Isabella, which he
accepted with the utmost reludance. He pre-|
served in a court the fame austerity of man-..
ners, which had distinguished him in the cloister.
He continued to imake all his journies on foot;
ie subsisted only upon alms-; his ads of morti.
fication were as severe as ever , and his pen-
ances as rigorous. Isabella, pleased with her'1
choice :, conferred on him, not long after , the
Archbifhoprick of Toledo, which next to the.
Papacy, is the richest dignity in the church of
Rome. This honour he declined with a firm-
ness, which nothing but the authoritative injunc-
tion of the Pope was able to overcome. Nor
did this height of promotion ,change his man.
ners. Though obliged to display in public
that magnificence which became his station, he
himself retained his monaftick severity. Under
his pontifical robes he constantly wore the coarse

frock of St. Francis, the rents in which he used Booc I.
to patch with his own hands. He- at no time 1 6.
used- linen.; but was commonly clad in hair-
cloth. He slept always in his habit, most fre-
quently on the ground, or on boards, rarely in
a bed. He did not taste any of the "delicacies
which appeared at his table, but satisfied him-
self with that simple diet which the rule' of his
order prescribed 3. Notwithstanding these- pecu-
liarities , so opposite to the manners of the
world, he poffeffed a thorough knowledge of
ts affairs;. and no sooner was he called by his
l.tion , and by the high opinion which Ferdi-
and and Isabella entertained of him , to take
,principal share in the adminditration, than he
ifplayed talents for business, which rendered
he fame of his wisdom equal to that of his
mnity. Bold and original in all his plans, his
olitical condud flowed from his real charader,
ad partook both of its virtues and its defects.
*is extensive genius suggested to him schemes,
uaft and magnificent. Conscious of the inte-
trity of his intentions, he purfaed these with
nremitting and undaunted, firmness. Accuf-
0oned. from his early youth to mortify his own
ffions , he fhewed little indulgence towards
iofe of other men.: Taught by his system of

who had been sent into Spain a few month
before the death of Ferdinand , produced fu

ever, Adrian acquired a dignity merely- nominal. BOOK Y.
Ximenes, though he treated him with great de- I 6,
cency , and even refped , retained the whole

THE Cardinal's first care was to observe the His precau-

motions of the Infant Don Ferdinand, whotionsagainit
having been flattered with so near a profped of Don Ser
supreme power, bore the disappointment of his 'ainand
hopes with greater impatience than could have

for his safety, removed him from Guadalupe,
the place in which he had been educated, to
TIVadrid , where he fixed the residence of the
court. There he was under 'the Cardinal's own
eye, and his condud, with that of his domeftics,
was watched with the utmost attention 3.

Low Countries, gave greater disquiet to the

her infirmities disqualified ,her from governing,
this incapacity had not been declared by, any
publick a&t of the Cortes in either kingdom ; so9

, that the Spaniards considered this resolution,

not only as a direc violation of their privileges,
but as an unnatural usurpation in a son on the
prerogatives of a mother, towards whom, in her
present unhappy situation , he manifested a less
delicate regard than her fubjeds had always ex-
pressed ". The Flemish court, however, having
prevailed both on the Pope and on the Emperor
to address letters to Charles as King of Castile;
the former of whom, it was pretended, had a
right, as head of the church ; and the latter, as
head of the empire, to confer this title; inftruc-
tions were sent to Ximenes , to prevail on the
Spaniards to acknowledge it. Ximenes, though
he had earnestly remonstrated agaiffft the mea-
sure , as no less unpopular than unnecessary,
resolved to exert all his authority and credit in
carrying it into execution , and immediately
assembled such of the nobles as were then at
court. What Charles required was laid before

his demands, they began to murmur against xg6,
such an unprecedented encroachment on their
privileges, and to talk high of the rights of

Ximenes hastily interposed, and' with' that firm
and decisive tone which was natural-to him-, told Recognized
them, that they 'were not called now to deli- thrugh the

On the spot he gave orders for that purpose 3S;
and notwithstanding the novelty of the pradice,
and the secret difcontents of many persons of
diftinion, Charles's title was universally recog-
nized. In Aragon, where the privileges of the
fubjed were more extensive, and the abilities as
well as authority of the archbishop of Saragossa,
whom Ferdinand had appointed regent, vwere
far inferior to those of Ximenes, the fame obfe-

the Cardinal considered as so many unjust ex-

there were circumstances in his situation which
promised him greater success than any King of

quarrels and' pretensions, which the authority of
Ferdinand had obliged them to dissemble, or to

pay a good body of troops, opposed and de-
seated all their designs with unexpeded vigour
and facility; :and though he did not treat the
authors of these disorders with any cruelty, he
forced them to ads of fubmiflfion, extremely

with a mixture of lenity , there was scarcely room
for jealousy or complaint. It was not To with
his next measure, which, by striking at a privi-
lege essential to the nobility, gave a general
alarm to the whole order. By the feudal con-
ftitution.., the military power was lodged in the
hands of the nobles, and men of an inferior
condition were called into the field only as their
vassals, and to follow their banners. *A King
with scanty revenues, and a limited prerogative,
depended on these potent barons in all his ope-

BOOIK L rations. It was with their forces he attacked
x si6, his enerpies, and with them he defended his

own kingdomn. While at the head of troops at-
tached warmly to their own lords, and accustomed.
to obey no other commands, his authority was
precarious, and his effbrts feeble. From this
slate Ximenes resolved to deliver the crown;
and as mercenary standing armies were unknown
under the feudal government, and would have
been odious to a martial and generous people,
he issued a proclamation, commanding every
city in Castile to enroll a certain number of its
burgesses, in order that they might be trained
to the use of arms on Sundays and holidays; he
engaged to provide officers to command .them
at the publick expence; and as an encourage-
rnent to the private men, promised them an ex-
emption from all taxes and impofitiohs. The
frequent incursions of the Moors from Africa,
and the necessity of having some force ready to
oppose them, furnished a plausible pretence for
this innovation. The obje&t really in view was
to secure the King a body of troops independent
of his barons , and which might serve to coun-
erbalance their power40. The nobles were not
ignorant of his intention, and saw how effedually
the fcherne which he had adopted -would ac-
complilh his end; but as a measure which had

the infidels was extremely popular, and as any
opposition to it arising from their order alone, [1sx6.
would have been imputed wholly to interested
motives, they endeavoured to excite the cities
themselves to refuse °obedience, and to remon-
ftrate against the proclamation, as inconsistent
with their charters and privileges. In confe-
quence of their inftigations, Burgos, Valladolid,
and several other cities, rose in open mutiny.
Some of the grandees declared themselves their
protedors. Violent remonftrances were pre-
fented to the King. His Flemish counsellors
were alarmed. Ximenes alone continued firm
and undaunted; and partly by terror, partly by
intreaty; by force in some instances, and by
forbearance in others, he prevailed on all the
refratory cities to comply ". During his ad-
ministration, he continued to execute his' plan
with vigour, but soon after his death it was en4
tirely dropt.

by which most of the grandees held these lainds
were extremely defecive; it was from some fuc
cefsful usurpation, -which the crown had beer
too feeble to dispute, that many derived thei
only title to poffeffion. An enquiry carrie
back to the origin of these encroachments, whid
1were almost co-eval with the feudal system, wa
impradicable; and as it would have ftrippe(

Such a step was, too bold, even for the enterpri2

the pensions granted during that 'time, refufei
to make any farther payment, because all righ
to them expired with his life. He then calle
to account such as had acquired crown - land
under the administration of that monarch, an
at once resumed whatever he had alienated. Ti
effeds of these revocations extended to manj
persons of high rank ; for though Ferdinan
was a Prince of little generosity, yet he and Ifa
bella having been raised to the throne of Caftil

by a powerful fadion of the nobles, they were
obliged to reward the zeal ,of their adherents
with great liberality, and the royal demefnes
were their only, fund for that purpose. The
addition made to the revenue of the crown by
these revocations, together with his own frugal
ceconomy, enabled Ximenes not only to ,discharge
all the debts which Ferdinand had left., and to
remit considerable sums to Slanders, but to pay
the officers of his new militia, and to establish
magazines more numerous, and better furnished
with artillery, arms, and warlike stores, than
Spain had ever poffeffed in any former agei:.
The prudent and disinterested application of
these sums, was a full apology to the people for
the rigour with which they were exaded.

- THE nobles, alarmed at these repeated at-
tacks, beg:an ,to think of precautions for the
safety of their order. Many cabals were form-

ceeded to extremities, they appointed some of
their numbers to examine the powers in confe-
quence of which the Cardinal exercised ads of
f such high authority. The admiral of Castile,
the duke de Infantado, and the conde de Bene-

these I will govern it, until the. King your master

declaration so bold and haughty silenced them,
and astonished their associates, To take airms
against a man aware of his danger, and prepared
for his defence, was what despair alone would
ditate. All thoughts of a general confederacy:

fters, who, presuming upon their favour with the
young King, aimed at direding the affairs of
Spain, 'as well as those, of their own country.
Jealous of his great abilities and independent
spirit, they considered Ximenes rather as a rival,
who might circumscribe their power, than as a
minifer, who by his prudence and vigour was
adding to the grandeur and authority of their
maiter. Every complaint against his admini*

tiers in the Low Countries. Unnecessary ob-
ftrudions were thrown by their means in the
way of all' his measures; and though they could
not either with decency or safety deprive him of
the office of regent, they endeavoured tp lessen
his autHority by dividing it. They soon dif-

with him in office, had neither genius nor spirit

of all his efforts to preserve his authority. Even
the nobles, influenced by this national passion,
and forgetting their jealousies and difcontents,
chose rather to fee the supreme power in the

feared than in those of foreigners, whom they

Navarre, schemes of-domeftick policy, and embarrassed by

the artifices and intrigues of the Flemish mi'
nifters had the burden of two foreign wars to.
support. The one was in Navarre, invaded by
its unfortunate monarch, John d'Albert. The
death of Ferdinand, the absence of Charles, the
discord and difaffedtion which reigned among
the Spanish nobles, seemed to present him with
a favourable opportunity of recovering his do-
minions. The Cardinal's vigilance, however,
defeated a mreafure so well concerted. As he

, foresaw the danger to which that kingdom might

be exposed , one of his first ads of adminiftra-

tions was to order thither a considerable body of Boor L
troops. While the King was employed with xJI6,
one part of his army in the siege of St. Jean
Pied en Port, Villalva; an officer of great ex-
perience and courage, attacked the other by
surprise, End cut it to pieces. The King in-
ftantly retreated with precipitation, and an end
was put to the war ". But as Navarre was filled
at that time with towns and castles, slightly
fortified, and weakly garrisoned, which being
unable to resist an enemy, served only to furnish
him with places of retreat; Ximenes, always
bold and decisive in his measures, ordered every
One of there to be dismantled, except Pampe-
Juna, the fortifications of which he propofed.to6
render very firong. To this uncommon pre-
caution Spain owes the poffeflion of Navarre,
The French, since that period, have often en-
tered, and have as often over-run the openr
country; but while they were exposed to all the
inconveniencies attending an invading army, the
Spaniards have easily drawn troops from the
neighbouring provinces to oppose them; and
the French, being destitute of strong towns to
which they could retire, lhave been obliged to
abandon their conquest with as much rapidity
as they gained it.

to offices or to favour resorted thither. They
soon d.iscovered that, without the patronage of

Boo. I. CHARLES was; fully sensible that he had dea
' 1s16. layed too long to take poffeflion of his domi,
Charles per-inions in Spain. Powerful obstacles, however,
i e7s to sod in his way, and detained him in the Low
Ifa Syain- C6untries. The war which the league of Cam-

bray had kindled in Italy, still subsisted; though,
during its cdurfe, the armies of all the parties
engaged in it, had changed their destination and
their obje&cs. France was now in alliance with
Venice, which it had at first combined to destroy.
MViaximilian and Ferdinand had for some years
carried on hostilities against France, their origi-
nal al!y, to the valour of whose troops the con-
federacy had been indebted for all its success.
Together with his kingdoms, Ferdinand tranf-
mntted this war to his grandson; and there was
reason to expect that 1VIaximilian, always fond of
new enterprizes, would persuade the young
monarch to enter into it with ardour. But the
Flemings, who had long poffeffed an extensive
commerce, which during the league of Cam-
bray, had grown to a great height upon the
ruins of the Venetian trade, dreaded a rupture
with France; and Chievres, sagacious to discern
the true interest of his country, and not warped
on this occasion by his love of wealth, warmly
declared for maintaining peace with the French
pation. Francis I. destitute of allies, and soli-
1itqus tqc secure his late conquefs in Italy by a

the negociation in the name of Charles. Gouffier
appeared as plenipotentiary for Francis. Each
of them had presided over the education of the
Prince whom he represented. They had both
adopted the fame pacific system; and& were
equally persuaded that the union of the two mo-
narchs was the happiest event for themselves, as
well as for their kingdoms. In such hands the
negociations did not languish. A few days after A peace cosa

dowry, should make over to him all his claims
and pretensions upon the kingdom of Naples ;
that in consideration of Charles's being already

thousand crowns a year to the French King;
and the half of that fum :annually, as lon.g as

only united Charles and Francis, but obliged
IVlaximilijn, who was unable alone to cope with
-the French and Venetians, to enter into a treaty
with those powers., which put a final period to
the bloody and tedious war that the league of
Cambray had occasioned. Europe enjoyed a
few years of universal tranquillity, and was in.
debted for that blessing to two Princes, whose
rivalfhip and ambition kept it in perpetual dif.
cord .and agitation during the remainder of their
reigns.

BY the treaty of Noyon, Charles secured a

safe passage into Spain. It was not, however,
the interest of his Flemish ministers, that he
Thould visit that kingdom soon. While he re-
sided in Slanders, the revenues of the Spanish
crown were spent there, and they engrossed,
without any competitors, all the effets of their
monarch's generosity; their country became the
feat of government , and all favours were dif-
penfed by them. Of all these advantages, they
ran. the rifque of feeing themselves deprived,
from the moment that their sovereign entered
Spain. The Spaniards would naturally assume
the diredion of their own affairs; the Low"
Countries would be considered only as a pro-

vince of that mighty monarchy; and they who BOOK R
now distributed the favours of the Prince to isi6.
others, must then be content to receive them
from the hands of strangers. But what Chievres Afraid of
chiefly wished to avoid was, an interview be-
tween the King and Ximenes. On the one
hand, the' wisdom, the integrity, and the mag.
nanimity f that prelate, gave him a wonderful
ascendant 'yver the minds of men; and it was
extremely probable, that these great qualities,
added to the reverence due to his age and office,
would command the refped of a young Prince,
who, capable of noble and generous sentiments
himself, would, in proportion to his admiration
of the Cardinal's virtues, lessen his deference
towards persons of another charadter. Or, on
the other hand, if Charles should allow his
Flemish favourites to retain all the influence
over his councils which they at present poffeffed,
it was easy to foresee that the Cardinal would
remonstrate loudly against such an indignity to
the Spanish nation, and vindicate the rights of
his country with the fame intrepidity and fuc.
cess, that he had asserted the prerogatives of
the crown. For these reasons, all his Flemish
counsellors combined to retard his departure;
and Charles, unfufpicious, from want of expe-
rience, and fond of his native country, fuffered
himself to'be unnecessarily detained in the Ne-

which he indulged himself by way of relaxation
after business, was to canvass, with a few friars
and divines, some intricate article in fcholaftick
'theology. Wasted by such a course of life, the
infirmities of age daily grew upon him. On
his journey, a violent disorder seized him at Bos
Equillos, attended with uncommon symptoms;
which his followers considered as the effect of
poison "., but could not agree whether the crime
ought to be imputed to the hatred of the
Spanish nobles, or to the malice of the Flemish
courtiers. This accident obliging him to stop

At the fame time he earnestly desired to hay
an interview with the King, that he might inforn
him of the state of the nation, and the tempel
of his fubjeAs. To prevent this, not only th(
Flemings, but the Spanish grandees, employed
all their address, and industriously kept Charle
at a distance from Aranda, the place to whid
the Cardinal had removed. Through their fug
geftions, every measure that he recommend'e
was rejeced; the utmost care was taken to
make him feel, and to point out to the whole
nation, that his power was on the decline; eve
in things purely trivial, such a choice was alway
made, as was deemed most disagreeable to him
Ximenes 'did not bear this treatment with hi
usual fortitude of spirit. Conscious of his own
integrity and merit,, he expedted a more gratefu
return from a Prince, to whom he delivered a
kingdom more flourishing than it had been in
any former age, together with authority more
extensive and better established, than the moil
illustrious of his ancestors had ever poffeffed,
He could not, therefore, on many occasions.,
refrain from giving vent to his indignation and
complaints. He lamented the fate of his coun.
try, and foretold the calamities which it would
fuffer from the insolence, the rapaciousness, and

gnorance of strangers. While his mind was BooK L
igitate'd by these passions, he received a letter 1517.
From the King , in which, after a few" cold and
Formal expressions of regard, he was allowed to
retire to his diocese; that after a life of such
continued labour, he might end hiS days in
tranfquillity. This message proved fatal to His daeath,
Ximenes. His haughty mind, it is probable,
would not survive disgrace; perhaps his gene-
tous heart could not bear the profpedt of the
misfortunes ready to fall on his country. Which-
soever of these opinions we embrace, certain it
is that he expired a 'few hours after reading the Nov. ?.
letter 9". The variety, the grandeur, and the
success of his schemes, during a regency'of only
twenty months, leave it doubtful, whether his
fagacityin council, his prudence in conduct, or
his boldness in execution, deserve the greatest
praise. His reputation is still high in Spain,
not only for wisdom, but for fandtity; arid he
is the only prime minister mentioned in history,

from the importance of the prize for which they

z o, those of the Germans, that it was hardly possible

to establish any cordial union between them; he
trusted not a little to the effect of Maximilian's
negociations, which, though they did not attain
their end, had prepared the minds of the Ger.
mnans for his elevation to the Imperial throne;
but what he relied on as a .chief recommenda.
tion, was the fortunate situation of his heredi.
tary dominions in Germany, which served as a
natural barrier to the I'mpire againlt the en.
croachments of the Turkish power. The con.
quests. the abilities, and the ambition of Sultan
Selim II. had spread over Europe, at that time,
a general ,and well - founded alarm. By his vic-
tories over the MVlamalukes, and the extirpation
of that gallant body of men. he had not only
added Egypt and Syria to his empire,. but had
secured to it such a degree of internal tranquil.
litv, that he was ready to turn against Christen-
dom the whole force of his arms, which nothing
hitherto had been able to refif. The most es-
fedaual expedient for flopping the progress of
this torrent, seemed to be the election of an Eri.
peror, poffeffed of extensive territories in that
country, where its first impression would be felt,
and who, besides, could combat this formidable
enepny with all the forces of a powerful monatr.
chy, and with all the wealth furnished by the

mines of the new world, or the commerce of
the Low Countries. T'hefe were the arguments
by which Charles publickly supported his claim;
and to men of integrity and reflection, they ap-
peared to be not only plausible, but convincing.
He did not, however, trust the success of his
cause to there alone. Great sums of money were
remitted from Spain; all the refinements and
artifices of negociation were employed; and a
considerable body of troops kept on foot by the
states of the Circle of Suabia, was secretly taken
into his pay. II he venal were gained by pre-

ON the other hand, Francis supported his or Francis

contended that it was now high time to convince
the Princes of the house of Austria that the Impe-
rial crown was elective, and not hereditary; that

their arrogance had come to regard as the pro-

impetuosity of the French cavalry, added to the
discipline and itability of the German infantry,
would form an army so irresistible, that, instead
of waiting the approach of the Ottoman forces,
it might carry hostilities into the heart of their
dominions; that the eledion of Charles would
'be inconsistent with a fundamental constitution,
by which the person who holds the crown of
Naples, is excluded from aspiring to the Impe.

would soon kindle a war in Italy, on account of
his pretensions to the dutchy of Milan, the effeds

favour of the princes by immense gifts, and by
infinite promises. As the expeditious method
of transmitting money, and the decent mode of
conveying a bribe by bills of exchange was then
little known, the French ambassadors travelled
with a train of horses loaded with treasure, an

IT was equally the interet , and more in the BooK L.
power of Henry VIII. of England, to prevent x1g9.
either Francis or Charles from acquiring a dig-°OHenrny
nity which would raise them so far above other
monarchs. But though Henry often boasted,
that he held the balance of Europe in his hand,
he had neither the steady attention, the accurate
discernment, nor the dispassionate temper which
that delicate function required. On this occa-
sion it mortified his vanity so much, to fee him-
self excluded from that noble competition which
refleced such honour upon the two antagonists,
that he took the resolution of sending an am-
baffador into Germany, and of declaring himself
a candidate for the Imperial throne. The am-
baffador, though loaded with caresses by the
German princes and the Pope's nuncio, informed -
his matter, that he could hope for no success in
a claim which he had been so late in preferring.

circumstance alone, and soothed with this often-
tatious display, of his own importance, seems tq
have taken no farther part in the matter , either
by contributing to thwart both his rivals, or to

I9 1n motions of the two contending monarchs with

a prudent attention, or who difcbvered a proper
folicitulide for the publick safety: The imperial
and Papal jurifdidtion interfered in so many
inffiances, the complaints of usurpation were so
lnumerous' on both sides, and the territories of
the church owed their security so little to their
own force, and so much to the weakness of the
powers around them, that nothing was so for
mnidable to the court of Rome as an Emperof
with extensive dominions, or' of entetprizing
genius. Leo trembled at the profped of be-
holding the Imperial crown placed o0i the head
of the King of Spain and of Naples, and the
rnafter of the new world; nor was he less afraid
6f feeing a King of France, who was duke of
Milan and lord of Genoa, exalted to that dig.
niity. He foretold that the eledti6n of either of
them would be fatal to the independence of the
holy fee, to the peace of Italy, and perhaps to
the liberties of Europe. But to oppose them
with any profped of success, required addrefk
and caution in proportion to the greatness of
their power, and their opportunities of taking
revenge. Leo %yas defedtive in neither. He
secretly exhorted the German princes to place
one of their own number on the Imperial throne,
which many of them were capable of filling

with honour. He put them irn mind of the BoOK I,
constitution by which the Kings of Naples were 1519g
for ever excluded from that dignity "'. He
warmly exhorted the French King -to persist in
his claim, riot from any desire that he should
gain his end; but as he foresaw that the Ger-
mans would be more disposed to favour the
King of Spain, he hoped that Francis himself,
when he discovered his own chance of success to
be desperate, would be stimulated by resent-
ment and the spirit of rivalfhip, to concur with
all his interest in raising some third person to
the head of the Empire; or, on the other hand,
if Francis should make unexpected progress, he
did not doubt but that Charles would be in-
duced by firnilar motives to adt the fame part;
and thus, by a prudent attention, the mutual
jealousy of the two rivals might be so dexterouflyf
managed, as to disappoint both. But this
scheme, the only one which a Prince in Leo's
situation could adopt, though concerted with
great wisdom, was executed with little difcre-
tion. The French ambassadors in Germany fed
their master with vain hopes; the Pope's nuncio,
being, gained "by them, altogether forgot the
inftrudions which he had received; and Francis
persevered so long and with such obstinacy, iin

tive masters, and in spite of all their folicitations,
intrigues, and prefeuts, the Ele dors did not
forget that maxim on wvhich the liberty of the
German constitution was thought to be 'founded.
Among the members of the Gerinanick body,
which is a great republick composed of states
almost independent, the first principle of patri-
ptifin is to depress and limit the'power of the

Emperor;

Emperor;. and of this idea so natural under Boo0i L
such a form of government, a German politician 1519,
seldom loses fight. No prince of considerable
power, or extensive dominions, had for some
ages been raised to the Imperial throne. To
this prudent precaution many of the great fami-
lies in Germany owed the splendour and inde-
pendence which they had acquired during that
period. To eled either 'of the contending mo-
narchs, would have been a gross violation of
that salutary, maxim; would have given to the
Empire a master, instead of an head; and wouldc
have reduced themselves from the rank of equals¾
to the condition of fubjeAs;

object which monarchs so far superior to him

deliberating upon the matter a short time, he
rejeced it with a magnanimity and difintereftedivhorejeis
ness, no less singular than admirable. Nothing, it,
he observed, could be more impolitick, than an

with for an Emperor who has not power to
invade our liberties; times of danger demand
one who is able to secure our safety. The
Turkiflh armies, led by a gallant and vitorious
monarch, are now assembling. They are ready:
to pour in upon Germany with a violence wn
known in former ages. New conjundures call
for new expedients. The Imperial sceptre must
be committed to some hand more powerful than
mine, or that of any other German prince. We

formidable enemy. Recourse must be had in
this exigency to one of the rival monarchs. Each
of them can bring 'into the field forces fufficient
for our defence. But as the King of Spain is
of German extradion; as he is a member and
priiTce of the- empire by the territories which
descend to him from his grandfather; as his
dominions stretch along that frontier which lies
mort exposed to the enemy; his claim is pre.
ferable, in my opinion, to that of a stranger to
our language, to our blood, and to our country;
and therefore I give my vote to confer on 'him
the Imperial 'crown.

THIs opinion, dicated by such uncommon

generosity, and supported by arguments so plau-

fible, made a deep impression on the Elecors. BooK I.

the important service which Frederick had done and refuses

refuse a crown, difdained to receive a bribe;
and. upon their entreating that, at least, he would
permit them to distribute part of that fum
among his courtiers, he replied: That he could
not prevent them from accepting what ihould
be offered, but whoever took a single florin

call in question the truth of this account of Frederick's be-

tioned by Georgius Sabinus in his History of the election
and coronation of Charles V. tom. iii. p. 6 3. But no great
stress ought to be laid on an omission in a superficial author,
whose treatise, though dignified with the name of History,
contains only such an account of the ceremonial of Charles's

history of his reign so worthy of attention.

A TRIVIA L circumstance first discovered the s effrea

of Charles. In all the publick writs which he
issued as King of Spain, he assumed the title of
M., e/kI and required it from his fubjedts as a
mark of their refped. Before that time, all the
monarchs of Europe were satisfied with the ap-
pellation of Highness, or Grace; but the vanity
of other courts soon- led them to imitate the ex-
ample of the Spanish. The epithet of Majesty
is no longer a mark of pre-eminence. The most
inconsiderable monarchs in Europe enjoy it, .and
the arrogance of the greater potentates has in-
vented no higher denomination "'.

quences of this new dignity. To fee the blood
of their countrymen shed in quarrels wherein
the nation had no concern; to behold its trea.
fures wasted in supporting the splendour of a
foreign title; to be plunged in the chaos of
Italian and German politics, were effects of this
event almost as unavoidable. From all these
considerations, they concluded, that nothing
could have happened more pernicious~o the
Spanish nation; and the fortitude and publick
spirit of their ancestors, who, in the Cortes of
Castile, prohibited Alphonzo the Wife from
leaving the kingdom, in order to receive the
Imperial crown, were often mentioned with the
highest praise, and pronounced to 'be extremely

war with greater vigour against the Turks, a
convocation of the clergy unanimously refused
to levy that fum, upon pretence that it ought
never to be exaded but at thole times when
Christendom was adually invaded by the Infi-
dels; and though Leo, in order to support his
authority, laid the kingdom under an interdit,
so little regard was paid to a censure which was
universally deemed unjust, that Charles himself
applied to have it taken off. Thus the Spanish
clergy, betides their merit in opposing the ufur-
pations of the Pope, and disregarding the influ-
ence of the crown, gained the exemption, which
they had claimed ".

IOOK .1. THE commotions which arose in the kingdom
x g19. of Valencia, annexed to the crown of Aragon,
An infur. were more formidable, and produced more dan
reaion in gerous and lasting effets. A seditious monk

having by his sermons excited the citizens of
Valencia, the capital city, to take arms, and to
punish certain criminals in a tumultuary man.
ner, the people, pleased with this exercise of
power, and with such a discovery of their own
importance, not only refused to lay down thej
arms, but formed themselves into troops and
companies that they might be regularly trained
to martial exercises. To obtain some security
against the oppression of the grandees was the
motive of this alfociation, and proved a powerful
bond of union; for as the ariftocratical privi-
leges and independence Were more complete in
Valencia than in any other of the Spanish king.
doms, the nobles, being scarcely accountable for
their condutc to any superior, treated the people
not only as vassals but as slaves. They were
alarmed, however, at the progress of this unex-
pedted infurredion, as it might encourage the
people to attempt Thaking off the yoke alto-
gether; but as they could not repress them
without taking arms, it became necessary to

x;2o. have recourse to the Emperor, and to desire his
Its progress. permission to attack them. At the fame time

the people made choice of 'deputies to represent BooI f.
their grievances, and to implore the protection 1 zo.
of their sovereign. Happily for the lattei, they
arrived' at court when Charles was exasperated
to an high degree against the nobility. As he
was eager to visit Germany, where his presence
became every day more necessary, and as his
FJlemilh courtiers were still more impatient to
return into their native country, that they might
carry thither the 1oils which they had amassed
in Castile, it was impossible for him to hold the
Cortes ofl Valencia in person. He had for that
reason empowered the cardinal Adrian to repre-
sent him in that Assembly, and in his name to
receive their o~h of allegiance, to confirm their
privileges with the usual folemnities, and to
demand of them .a free gift. But the Valencian
nobles, who considered this measure as an indig-
nity to their country, which was no less enti-
tled, than his other kingdoms, to the honour
of their fovereign's presence, declared that by
the fundamental laws of the 'conftitution they
could neither acknowledge as King a person who
was absent, nor grant him any subsidy, and
to this declaration they adhered with an haughty
and inflexible 'obftinacy. Charles, piqued by,
their behaviour, decided in favour of the people,
and rashly authorized them to continue in arms.
Their deputies returned in triumph, and wero

of their country. The insolence· of the mul-

wildest disorders, but of the most fatal calamiL
ties in that kingdom 7. *

.he Coates MEANWHILE, the kingdom of Castile was
summoned agitated with no less violence. No sooner was
oealiaet in te Emperor's intention to leave Spain made

known, than several cities of the first rank re-
solved to remonstrate against it, an.d to crave
redress once more of those grievances which they
had formerly laid before him. Charles artfully
avoided admitting their deputies to audience;
and as he saw from this circumstance, how diffi-
cult it would be at this jundure to restrain the
mutinous spirit of the greater cities, he fum-
moned the Cortes of Castile to meet at Com-
poflella, a town in Galicia. His only reason for
calling that assembly, was the hope of obtaining
another donative; for as his treasury had been
exhausted in the fame proportion that the riches
of his minilfers increased, he could not, without.

splendour suited to the Imperial dignity. To xso.
appoint a meeting of the, Cortes in so remote a
province, anid to demand a new subsidy before
the time for paying the former was expired,
were innovations of a most dahgerous tendency;
and among people not only jealous of theirlibexr-
ties, but accuffomed to supply the wants of
their sovereigns with a very frugal hand, excited
an universal alarm. The magifftrates of Toledo
remonfirated against both thefre measures in a
very high tone; the inhabitants of Valladolid,
who expeded that the Cortes ffiould have been
held in that city, were so enraged that they took
arms in a tumultuary manner; and if Charles
with his foreign counsellors had not fortunately
made their escape during a violent tempest, they
would have massacred all the Flemings, and
have prevented him from continuing his journey
towards Compoftella.

however, which influence popular assemblies,
bribes, promises, threats, and even force, were
employed in order to gain members. The no-
bles, soothed by the refpedful assiduity with
which Chiev.res and the other Flemings payed
court to them, or instigated by a mean 'jealoufy
of that spirit of independence which they saw
.rising among the commons, openly favoured
the pretensions of the court, or -at the utmost
did not oppose them; and at last, in contempt

hot only of the sentiments of the nation, but BOOK 1,
of the ancient forms of the constitution, a ma- r

iority voted to grant the donative for which the
Emperor had applied '. Together with this
grant, the Cortes laid before Charles a reprefen-

craved redress; ^but he, having obtained from
them. all ,that he could expect, paid no attention
to: this ill-timed petition, which it was no longer
dangerous to disregard 77.

As nothing now retarded his embarkation, he Charles ap-
disclosed his intention with regard to the regencypoints re-

that-of Valencia on Don Diego de Mendoza
Conde de Melito. The choice of the two latter
was universally acceptable; but the advance-
ment of Adrian, though the only Fleming who
had preserved any reputation among the Spa-
niards, animated the Caftilians with new hatred
against foreigners; and even the nobles, who
had so tamely fuffered other inroads upon the
constitution, felt the indignity offered to theiri

though two young and high - spirited Princes,
and each of them animated with the hope
of success , might be capable of forming such
a generous resolution , it was soon found that
they promised upon a moderation too refined
and disinterested for human nature. The pre.
ference given to Charles in the fight of all Eu:
rope, mortified Francis to the highest degree,
and inspired him wvith all the pafiions natural to
disappointed ambition. To this was owing the
personal jealousy and rivalfhip which subsisted
between the two monarchs during their whole
reign ; and the rancour of these, augmented by
a real opposition of interest , which gave rife to
many unavoidable causes or discord , involved
them in almost perpetual hostilities. Charles
had paid no regard to the principal article in

Guic. lib. i3. p. I99

the treaty of Noyon, by refuting oftener than Booi II
once to do justice to John d'Albert, the exclud- xszo.
ed monarch of iNavarre, whom Francis was
lound in honour , and prompted by interest, to
restore to'his throne. The French King had pre-
tensions to the crown of Naples, of which Ser-
dinand had deprived his predecessor by a nimor
injuftifiable breach of faith. The Emperor
might reclaim the dutchy of Milan as a fief of
the Empire, ,which Francis had seized, and still
kept in poffefion, without having received in-
veftiture. Charles considered the dutchy of Bur-
gundy as the patrimonial domain of his ancestors
wvrefted from' them by. the unjust policy of Louis
XI. and observed with the greatest jealousy the
ftridt conneCtions which Francis had formed with
the duke of Gueldres , the hereditary enemy of
his family.

WHEN the sources gs discord were so many Their de i
and various, peace could be of no long con- braons o
tinuance , even between princes the most ex-the com-
empt from ambition or emulation. But as thel iencement
shock between two fuich mighty antagonists
could not fail of being extremely violent, they
both discovered no small solicitude about its
consequences, and took time not only to colb

compare it with that of their adversary , but ts

become absolute snafter in Italy. ,If it had been
in his power to engage them in hostilities, with.
out rendering Lombardy the theatre of war, no-
thing would have .been more agreeable to him
than to fee them waste each other's strength in
endless guarrels. But this was impoflible. Leo
foresaw, that, on the first rupture between the
two monarchs', the armies of France and Spain
would take the field in the Milanese; andv while
the scene of their operations was so near, and
the fubjed for which they contended so interest.
ing to him, he could not long remain neuter.
He was obliged, therefore, to adapt his plan
of conduct to his political situation. He courted
and soothed the Emperor and King of France
with equal industry and address. Though
warmly solicited by each of them to espouse his
cause , he assumed all the appearances of entire
impartiality , and attempted to conceal his real
sentiments under that profound dissimulation
which seems to have been affeded by most of
the Italian politicians in that age.

with the THE views and interest of the .Venetians were
venetiais. not different from those of the Pope; nor were

they less solicitous to prevent Italy from becom-
ing the feat of war, and their own republick
fropl being involved in the-quarrel. But through
all Leo's artifices, and notwithstanding his high
pretensions to a perfed neutrality, it was visible
that he leaned towards the Emperor, from whom
he ha-both more to fear and more to hope than
from Francis, and it was equally manifest , that
if it became necessary to take a fide, the Vene-
tians would, from motives of the fame nature,
declare for the King of France. No confider-
able assistance, however, was to. be expeaed
from the Italian states, who were jealous to an
extreme degree of the Transalpine powers, and
careful to preserve the balance between them,

favourite maxim of their policy, by the certain

' his kingdom, and the disposition of his fubjeds.

Ambitious, adive, enterprizing and accdmplifh-
ed in all the martial exercises which in that age
formed a chief part in the ,education of persons
of noble birth, and inspired them with an early
love of war , he longed to engage in adtion,
and to signalize the beginning of his reign by
faome remarkable exploit. Ap opportunity fooi

presented itself ; and the viaory at Guinegate,.
together with the fuccefsful sieges of Terouienne
and Tournay , though of little utility to England,
refleaed great lustre on its monarch, and con-
firmed the idea which foreign princes entertained
of his power and importance. So many con-
curring causes, added to the happy situation of
his own dominions, which secured them from'fo.
reign invasion ; and to the fortunate circum-
stance of his being in poffeffion of Calais, which
served not only as a key t6 France, but opened
an easy passage into the Netherlands, rendered
the King of England the natural. guardian of the
liberties ofEurope, and the arbiter between the-
Emperor and French monarch. Henry him-
self was sensible of this fiigular advantage, and
convinced, that, in order to preserve the balance
even, it was his office to prevent either of the
rivals from acquiring such superiority of power
as might be fatal to the other, or formidable tot
the reft of Christendom. But he was destitute
of the penetration, and still more of the temper;
which such a- delicate fundion required. Influ-
enced by caprice, by vanity, by resentment, by
affetion, he was incapable of forming any regu-
lar and extensive system of policy, or of adhering
to it with steadiness. His meafi.res seldom re-
fulted from attention to the general welfare, or
from a deliberate regard to his own interest, but

owing to the violent 'paffons and insatiable am-
bition of his prime minister and favourite, cardi.
nal Wolsey. This man, from one of the lowefi
ranks in life, had risen to an height of power
and dignity, to which no English fubjed ever
arrived; and governed the haughty , prefump,
tuous, and untradable spirit of Henry. with
absolute authority. Great talents, and of very
different kinds,. fitted him for the two opposite,
flations of minister, and of favourite. His pro-
found judgment , his unwearied industry., his
thorough acquaintance with the fRate of the
kingdom, his extensive knowledge of the views
and interests of foreign courts, qualified him for
that uncontrouled direcion of affairs with which
he was intrufted. The elegance of his manners,
the gaiety of his conversation, his insinuating
address , his love of magnificence, and his pro-
ficiency in those parts of literature of which

Heary was fond, gained him the affedtion. and Boor IL
confidence of the young monarch. Wolsey was 15Z·
fa' ·from employing this vast and almost royal
power, to promote either the true interest of the
nation, or the real grandeur of his master. Ra-
pacious at the fame time, and profuse, he was
insatiable in desiring wealth. Of boundless am-
bition, he aspired after new honours with an
eagerness unabated by his former success; and
being rendered presumptuous by his uncommon
,elevation, as well as by the ascendant which he
had gained over a Prince, who scarcely brooked
advice from any other person, he discovered in
his whole demeanour the most overbearing
haughtiness and pride. To these passions he him-
self sacrificed every consideration; and whoever
endeavoured to obtain his favour, or that of
his master, found it necessary to sooth and to
gratify them.

As all the states of Europe fought Henry's The cout

friendship at that time, all courted his minister pai t6
with incredible attention and obfequroufnefs, and FWocyy
strove by presents, by promises, or by flattery,
to work upon his avarice, his ambition , or his
pride \. Francis had, in the year one thousand

affinity to the King of England, gave him some
title to his friendship; and soon after his accef-

to ingratiate himself with Wolsey, by fettling
on him a pension of three thousand livres. His

and artful courtiers, to gain the haughty prelate,
He himself bestowed on him every mark of re.
sped and confidence. He consulted him with
regard to his most important affairs, and re.
ceived his responses with implicit deference. By
these arts, together with the grant of a large
pension, Francis secured the Cardinal, who'per.
fuaded his master to surrender Tournay to
France, to conclude a treaty of marriage be.
tween his daughter the Princess Mary and thi
Dauphin, and to cbnfent to a personal interview
-with the French King . From that time, the
rnoft familiar intercourse subsisted between the
two courts; Francis, sensible of the great value
of Wolfey's friendship, laboured to secure the
continuance of it by every possible expression of
regard, beftowing on him ini all his letters the
honourable appellations of Father, Tutor, and
Governor.

dlief solicitude at present was to prevent the Blo IR .
intended interview with Francis, the effets of I5sao
which upon two young Princes, whose hearts
were no less susceptible of friendship than their
manners were capable of inspiring it, he extremely
dreaded. But after .many delays, occasioned by
difficuClties about the ceremonial, and by the anxi-
ous precautions of both courts for the safety of
their .refpedive sovereigns, the- time and place
of meeting were at last fixed. Messengers had
been sent to different courts, inviting all comers,
who were gentlemen, to enter the lifts at tilt
and tournament, against the two monarchs and
their knights. Both Francis and Henry loved the
splendour of these fpedacles too well, and were
too much delighted with the graceful figure
which they made on such occasions, to forego
the pleasure or glory which they expeded from
such a singular and brilliant assembly. Nor was
the Cardinal less fond of displaying his magnifi-
cence in the presence of two courts, and of dif.
covering to the two nations the extent of his
influence over both their monarchs. Charles,
finding it impossible to prevent the interview,
endeavoured to disappoint its effeds, and .to
pre-occupy the favour of the English monarch,
and his minister, by an ad of complaisance fill
more flattering and more uncommon. Having
failed fromi Corunna, as has already been related,

BooK:II. he steered his course diredly towards England,

a.zo," and relying wholly on Henry's generosity for his

Charles own safety, landed at Dover. This unexpeted
is Eng visit surprised the nation. -Wolsey, however
Maywh. was well acquainted with the Emperor's

intenn

tion. A negociation, unknown to the historians
of that age, had been carried on between him
and the court of Spain; this visit had been con.
cerfed; and Charles granted the Cardinal, whom
he calls his most dear friend , an additional pen.
sion of seven thousand ducats *. Henry, who
was then at Canterbury, in his way to France,
immediately dispatched Wolsey to Dover, in
order to welcome the Emperor ; and being
highly pleased with an event so soothing to his
vaniity, hastened to receive, with suitable refped,
a guest who had placed in him such unbounded

nfinnuates confidence. Charles, to whom time was pre.
Iaour ~ t"ocious, staid only fdur days in England: But
vrith the during that short space, he had the address not
hng eand only to give Henry favourable imprefifons of his

charader and intentions, but to detach Wolsey

the college of cardinals was greatly superior to
the French King's, Wolsey grasped eagerly at
an offer which that artful Prince had made him
of exerting it vigorously in his behalf; and al-
lured by this profped, which under the pontifi-
cate of Leo, still in the prime of his life, was a
very distant one, he entered with warmth into
all the Emperor's ichemes. No treaty, however,
was -concluded at that .time between the two
monarchs; but Henry, in return for the honour
which Charles had done him, promised to
visit him in some place tof the Low Countries,

5 The French and English historians describe the pomp

of this interview, and the various fpetacles, with great
.minuteness. One circumfiance mentioned by the marechal
de Fleuranges, who was pre(ent, and which appears fingu
lar in the present age, is commonly omitted. " After the
tournament, " says he, " the Frenich and English wreftlers
made their appearance, and wrestled in presence of the
Kings, and the ladies; and as there were many flout wreti
lers there, it afforded excellent pastime; but as the King
of France had neglefted to bring any wreftlers out of Bre-
tagne, the English gained the prize. - After this, the
Kings of France and England retired to a tent, where they
drank together, and the King of England seizing the King
of France by the collar, said, " My brothier, 1 mufif -refll
tiPith you, " and endeavoured once or twice to trip up .his
heels; but the King of France, who is a dexterous wrestler,
twisted him round, and threw him .on the' earth with pro-
digious violence. The King of England wanted'to reniew
the combat, but was prevented. " YNImoires de Fleuranges,

peared to him a plain acknowledgment that he
held the balance in his hands, and convinced
him of the justness of the motto which he had
chosen, cc That whoever he favoured would
prevail. " In this opinion he was confirmed by
an offer which Charles made of submitting any
difference that might arise between him and
Francis to his sole arbitration. Nothing could
have the appearance of greater candour and
moderation, than the choice of a judge who was
reckoned the common friend of both. But as the
Emperor had now attached Wolsey entirely to
his interest, no proposal could be more insidious,
nor, as appeared by the sequel, more fatal to the

form of absolution used by Tetzel. " May our Lord Jesus

of his most holy passion. And I by his authority, that of

Pope, granted and committed to me in'there parts, do ab-

such extravagant expreflions, are feleded out of Luther's
works by Chemnitius in his Examen Concilii Tridentini,

had received a learned education, during the

his mind was naturally susceptible of serious
impressions, and tinAured with somewhat of
that religious melancholy which delights iin the
solitude and devotion of a monaftick life, he
retired into a convent of Augustinian friars, and
without fuffering the intreaties of his parents to
divert him from what he thought his duty to
God, he assumed the habit of that order. There

self to the Rfudy of it, with such eagerness and
assiduity, as astonished the monks, who were
little accustomed to derive their theological
notions from that source. The great progress
which he made in this uncommon course of
study, augmented' so much the fame both of his
fandity and of his learning, that Frederick,
Eledor of Saxony., having founded an university
at Wittemberg on the Elbe, the place of his
residence, Luther was chosen first to teach phi-
lofophy, and afterwards theology there, and
discharged both offices in such a manner, that
he was deemed the chief ornament of that
society,

virtues, which had, in other places, imposed on
the credulity of the people. As Saxony was
not more enlightened than the other provinces
of Germany, Tetzel met with prodigious fuc-
cess there, It was with the utmost concern,
that Luther beheld the artifices of those who
fold, and the simplicity of those who bought,
Indulgences, The opinions of Thomas Aquinas
and the other fchoolmen, on which the doctrine
of Indulgences was founded, had already loft
much of their authority with him; and the
Scriptures, which he began to confider as the
great standard of theological truth, afforded no
countenance to a pracice, equally subversive
of faith and of morals. His warm and impe-
'tuous temper did not fuffer him long to con-
ceal such important discoveries, or to continue
a silent fpedlator of the delusion of his country-
men. From the pulpit in the great church of
Wittemberg he inveighed bitterly against the
irregularities and vices of the monks who pub-.
lilhed Indulgences; he ventured to examine the
doarines which they taught, and pointed out to
the people the danger of relying for salvation
upon any other means than those appqinted by

BooK II. God in his word. The boldness and novelty of

15Zo. these opinions drew great attention, and being

recommended by the authority of Luther's per.
fonal character, and delivered with a popular
and persuasive eloquence, they made a deep irm.
pression on his hearers. Encouraged by the
favourable reception of his'doarines among the
people, .he wrote to Albert, eledor of Nlentz
and archbishop of Magdeburgh, to whose jurif
diaion that part of Saxony was fubjea , and
remonstrated warmly against the falfe' opinions

joined solemn protefcations of his high refped

order, though addided with no less obfequiouf-by hi own

these uncommon opinions. Luther had by his
piety and learning acquired extraordinary au-
thority among his brethren; he profeffed the
highest regard for the authority of the Pope;
his profeffions were at that time sincere; and as
a secret enmity, excited by intereff or emula-
tion, subsists among all the monaftick orders in
the Romish church, the Auguftinians were
highly pleased with his invetives against the
Dominicans, and hoped to fee them exposed to
the hatred and scorn of the people. Nor was
his sovereign the Eledor of Saxony, the wisest
prince at that time in Germany, diffatisfied with
this obftrudion which Luther threw in the way
of the publication of Indulgences. He secretly
encouraged the attempt, and flattered hirnfelf

But the manner in which they conduted the

Luther attempted to combat Indulgences by
arguments founded in reason , or derived from

not hesitate about appearing before Cajetan,
and having obtained the Emperor's fafe-coni-

Cardinal received him with decent refped , and
endeavoured at first to gain upon him by gentle
,treatment: But thinking it beneath the dignity
of his fRation to enter into any formal dispute
with a person of such inferior rank, he required
shim, by virtue of the apoftolick powers with
which he was clothed, to iretrac't the errors which
he had uttered with regard to indulgences, and
*the nature of faith; and to abstain, soir. the
future, from the publication of new and dan-
gerous opinions. Luther, fully persuaded of
the truth of his own tenets, and con.fgmed in
the belief of them by the approbation which
they had met wi-th among, persons conspicuous
both for their learning and piety, was furprized
at" this abrupt mention of a recantation, before

xszo. that in a conference concerning ,the points in

dispute, with a prelate of such distinguished
abilities, he would be able to remove many o
those imputations with which the ignorance 61
malice of his antagonists had loaded him; but
the high tone of authority that the Cardin
assumed, extinguished at once all hopes of this
kind, and cut off every profped of advantage

His intrepid from the interview. His native intrepidity of
behaviour, mind, however, did not desert him. He de.

clared, with the utmost firmness, that he could
not, with a safe conscience, renounce opinions
which he believed to be true; nor should any
consideration ever induce him .to do what would
be so base in itself, and so offenfive to God
At the fame time, he continued to express no
less reverence than formerly for the authority
of the apoftolick fee "'; he signified his willing:
ness to submit the whole controversy to certain
universities which he named, and promised
neither to" write nor to preach concerning Indul.
gences for the future , provided his adversaries
were ltewife enjoined to be silent with refped
to them '. All these offers Cajetan disregarded
or rejeaed, and still insisted 6peremptorily on a
simple recantation, threatening him with eccle.
fiaftical censures, and forbidding him to appear

'This haughty and violent manner of proceed-

even the Imperial fafe-conduC would not be
'able to protect him from the legate's power and
resentment, that they prevailed on him to with-
draw secretly from Augfburgh, and to return to
his own country. But before his departure,
according to a form of which there had been
some examples, he prepared a solemn appeal, H's apeal,

from political motives, and was afforded with
great secrecy and caution. He had neither heard
any of Luther's discourses, nor read any of'his

his fame, he had never once admitted him into
his presence '7. 'But upon this demand which
the Cardinal made, it became neceffaty to throw
off somewhat of his former reserve. He had

Luther had been required to appear at Rome, xsszo
were so eager to display their zeal agaitpft his
errors, that, without waiting for the expiration
of the fity days allowed him in the citation,
4tey had already condemned him as an here-
tick "". Leo had, in several of his brieves and
letters, stigmatized him as a child of iniquity,
and a man given up to a reprobate" sense. No-
thing less, therefore, than a recantation could
save the honour of the church, whose maxim it
is, never to abandon the smallest point that it
has established, and which is even precluded, by
its pretensions to infallibiity , from having it in.

what veneration was paid, at that time, to eccle-

books to be burnt at Rome, he, by way of reta-

iih the university of Wittemberg, and with great
pomp, in presence of a.vast multitude of fpeda-
tors, cast the volumes of the canon law, toge-
ther with the bull of excommunication, into. the

cities of Germany. The manner in which he.
justified this action, was still more offenfive than
the at&ion itself. Having colleAed from the ca-
non law some of the most extravagant propositions
with regard to the plenitude and omnipotence,
of the Pope's power, as well as the fubordina-
tion of all secular jurifdiCion to his authority,
he published these with a commentary, pointing
out the impiety of such tenets, and their evident
tendency to subvert all civil government ".

with great heat and passion on both sides, was still!
carried on with its proper weapons, with theses,

however, was made upon the minds of the people;
their reverence for ancient institutions and doc-
trines was shaken; and the materials were al,

tion that soon spread over all Germany. Stu-
dents crowded from" every province of the Empire
to Wittemberg; and under Luther himself; Me-
landhon, Carloftadius, and other masters, then

two different methods of treating him lay before
the Pope; by adopting one of which the attempt,

the other it might have been rendered innocent. s52o,
If Luther's first departure from the doArines of

controverted points in discourses addressed to the
people; if he had enjoined the difputants on
both sides to be silent; if he had been careful
not to rifque the credit of the church by defin.

and upiia SUCH a series of errors in the meaSures of A
f Luter. court, seldom chargeable with mistaking its own

true interest, is not more astonishing thain the
wisdom which appeared in Luther's condud.
Though a perfect firanger to the maxims of
' humani prudence , and incapable, from the im-
petuofity of his temper, of obserVing them, he
was led naturally by the method in which he
made his discoveries, to carry on his operations
in a manner which contributed more to their fUic-
cess, than if every step he 'took had been pre-
.fcribed by the miof artful policy. At the time

tween these opposite systems, arid by embracing1
them alternately, defeated the effets of both;
3By an' improper exertion of authority, Luther
was exasperated, .but not reffrained. By a mif.
taken exercise of lenity, time was given for his
opinions to spread , but no progress made to.
wiards reconciling him to the church; and even
the sentence of excommunication, which at ano-
ther juncure might have been decisive, was de-
layed so long, that it became at last fearcely ait
objet of terror.

when .he set himself to oppose Tetzel, he was
far from intending that :reformation which he
afterwards effeded ; -and.. would

. have trembled

with horror at the thoughts of what at last
he glo~ried in accomplishing, The knowledge
of truth was not poured into his mind, all at
9Gce,,by any special revelation, he acquired it
y: industry and. meditation , and his progress, of
cpnfeqfuence, was gradual. The d6drines of
Popery are so closely conneded, that the expos-
ing of one error conducted him naturally to the
detedio.in of others; and all the parts of that arti-
ficial. fabrick were so linked together, that. the
pulling down of one loosened 'the foundatioin
of the reft, and rendered it more easy to over-
turn them. In confuting the extravagant tenets
concerning Indulgences, he was obliged, to in-
quire into, the true cause of our justification and
acceptance with God. The knowledge of that,,
difdovered to him by degrees the inutility of
pilgrimages and penances ; the vanity of rely-
ing on the intercession of faints; the impiety of
.wiOhipping them; the abuses of auricular, con-
fenio.n; and the imaginary existence of purga-
tqry.. 'The detedion of so many errors, led him

teehth cen.fourteenth, and the beginning of the fifteenth

veneration with which the world had been ac-

three contending Pontiffs roaming about Europ;e
at a time; fawning on the Princes whom they
9wanted to gain.; squeezing the countries which'
acknowledged their authority ; excommunica^
ting their rivals, and cursing those who adhered
to them, discredited their pretensions to infal-
libility, and exposed both .their persons and their
office to contempt. The laity , to whom all
parties appealed , came to learn that some right
of private judgment belonged to them, and ac-
quired the exercise of it so far as to chufe,.
among these infallible guides, whom they would,
please to, follow. The proceedings of the coun-e
cils of Constance and Basil , spread this dif-
refpecdt for the Romish fee flill -wider, and by.
their bold exertion of authority in deposing and
eleding Popes, taught the world that there wash

in the church a jurifdiaion superior even to the BOOK It
papal power, which they had long believed to xs2o.
be supreme.

THE wound given on' that occasion to theThe pondi-

papal authority was scarcely healed up , whenficates of
the pontificates of Alexander VI. and Julius II. V. and of
both able princes , but detestable ecclefiaftiks, Julius m,
raised new" scandal in Christendom. The pro-
fligate morals of the former in private life; the
fraud., the injustice, and cruelty of his publick
administration, place him on a level with those
tyrants, whose deeds are the greatest reproach

him to reform the disorders of the clergy, thus expresses
himself: " De Chrifti patrimnonio, .ludos, haftiludia & tor-,

to the means of augmenting its revenues, imi-

its pardons to such transgressors as gave a iurn

in order to prevent any imposition in carrying
it on, the officers of the Roman chancery pub-
lifhed a book, containing the precise fum to be
exaded for the pardon of every particular fin.
A deacon guilty of murder was absolved for
twenty crowns. A bishop or abbot might affaf-

ancient customs, more inclinable -than any people
in Europe to listen to those who called on them
to assert their liberty. During the long contests
between the Popes and Emperors concerning
the right of investiture, and the wars which
these occasioned, most of the considerable Ger-
man ecclefiafticks joined the papal fadion; and
w'hile engaged in rebellion against the head of
the Empire, they seized the Imperial revenues,
and usurped the Imperial jurifdicion within
their own diocefes. Upon the re- establishment
of tranquillity , they still retained these ufurpa-
tions, as if by the length of an unjust poireflion
they had acquired a legal right to them. The
Emperors, too feeble to wrefi them out of their
hands, were obliged to grant the clergy fiefs of
those vast territories, and they enjoyed all the
immunities as well as honours which belonged to
feudal barons. By means of these, many bishops

not only to the great reverence for the sacred

against all who invaded their poffeffions. Many
observing this, made a surrender. of their lands

availing themselves of every circumstance which?
occurred, by taking advantage of the fuperfti-.
tion of some Princes, of the necessities of others,
and of the credulity of the people, at length
established their pretensions, in opposition both
to the interest and common sense of mankind.
Germany was the country which these eccle-
fiaftical sovereigns governed with most absolute
authority. They excomrmunicated and deposed
some of its most illustrious Emperors, and ex-
cited their fubjeds, their ministers, and even
their children, to take arms against them. Amidst
these contests, the Popes continually extended
their own immunities, spoiling the secular Prin-
ces gradually of their most valuable prero-
gatives , and the German church felt all the
rigour of that oppression which flows from sub-
jection to foreign dominion, and foreign ex-
adions.

Nominatea THE right of conferring benefices, which the
by the ope.'Popes usurped during that period of confusion,

was an acquisition of great importance, and
exalted the ecclesiastical power upon the ruins
of the temporal. The Emperors and other
princes of Germany had long been in poffeffion
of this right, which served to increase both their
authority and 'their revenue. <But by wresting

it out of their hands, the Popes were enabled BOOK IL.
to fill the' Empire with their own creatures; x~,o.
they accustomed a great body of every prince's
fubjets to depend;not upon him, but upon the
Roman fee; they bestowed upon strangers the
richest benefices in every country, and drained
their wealth to supply the luxury of a. foreign
court. Even the patience of the most super-
fritious ages mutinied under such oppression;
and so loud and frequent were the complaints
and murmurs of the Germans, that the Popes,
afraid of irritating them too far, consented, cons
trary to their usual pracice, to abate somewhat
of their pretensions, and to 'reft satisfied with
the right of nomination to such benefices as
happened to fall vacant during fix months in
'the year, leaving the disposal of the remainder
to the princes and other legal patrons 4

der the exertion of papal power -unbounded,
expedlative graces, or mandates nominating a
person to succeed to a benefice upon the first
vacancy that should happen, were brought into
use. By means of these, Germany was filled
with persons depending on the court of Rome,
from which they received such reversionary
grants; princes were defrauded, in a great de-
gree, of their prerogatives; the rights of lay-
patrons were pre-occupied, and rendered almost
entirely vain '

upon his admifflion to his benefice, paid annats,
or one year's rent of his living, to the Pope;
and as that tax was exaded with great rigour,
its amount was prodigious. To. this mut be

such the . sentiments concerning them, that pre.

appear excessive to his contemporaries, whose
minds were strongly agitated by those interesting
controversies which he carried on, and who had
themselves endured the rigour of papal tyranny,
and seen the corruptions in the church- against
which he exclaimed.

NOR were they offended at that gross fcur-

ence of which none of his forerunners in the fame
course had enjoyed. Among these may be rece
koned the invention of the art of printing,:
about half a century before his time. By this
fortunate discovery, the facility of' acquiring and
ps propagating knowledge was wonderfully in-
creased, and Luther's books which muff other-
wife have made their way slowly and with un.
certainty into distant countries, spread at once
all over Europe. Nor were they read only by
the rich and the learned, who alone had access
to books before that invention; they got into
the hands of the people, who, upon this appeal
to them as judges, ventured to examine and to
rejet many dpotrines, which they had formerly
been required to believe, pyithout being taught
to understand them.

THE revival of learning at the fame period, BoorK II
was a circumstance extremely friendly to the ,.a.Q
Reformation. The study of the ancient GreekAnd of the
and Roman authors, and the discovery of that learning.
liberal and found knowledge which they con-
tain, routed the human mind from the profound
lethargy in which it, had been funk during feve-
ral centuries. Mankind seem, at that period, to
have recovered the powers of inquiring and of
thinking, faculties of which they had long loft
the use; and fond of the acquisition, they exer-
cifed them with great boldness upon all fubjeas.
They were not now afraid of entering an un-
common path, or of embracing a new opinion.
Novelty appears rather to have been a recom-
mendation of a. doarine ; and instead of being
startled when the daring hand of Luther drew
aside, or tore the veil which covered established
errors , th, genius of the age applauded and
aided the attempt. Luther, though a stranger
to elegance in taste or composition, zealously
promoted the cultivation of ancient literature;
and sensible of its being necessary, in studying
the scriptures , he himself had acquired confi-
derable knowledge both in the Hebrew and
Greek tongues. Melandthon, and fpme other
of his disciples, were eminent proficients in the
polite Arts; and as the fame\ barbarous monks
who oppofedj the introduetion of learning into

reception of the latter to be the effed of tt
progress which the former had made, the cau(
of learning and of the Reformation came to b
considered as closely conneded, and, in ever
country, had the fame friends.and the fame eni

the con~test at first with great superiority. Eru

church, and perceived the futility of those argu-
ments, by which illiterate monks endeavoured
to defend them. Their contempt of these advo.-
cates for the received errors, led them frequently
to expose the opinions which they supported,
and to ridicule their ignorance with great free-
dom and severity. By this, men were prepared
for the more serious attacks made upon them
by Luther , and their reverence both for the
doarines and persons against whom he inveighed,
was considerably abated. This was particularly
the cafe in Germany. When the first attempts
were made to revive a taste for ancient learning
in that country, the Ecclefiafticks there, who
were frill more ignorant than their brethren on
the other fide of the Alps, set themselves to
oppose its progress with more adive zeal; and
the patrons- of the new fitudies, in return,
attacked them ,with greater violence. In the
'writings of Reuchlin , Hutten , and the other
revivers of learning in Germany, the corruptions
of the church of Rome are censured with an
acrimony of style, little inferior to that of Luther
himself 4.

of the clergy. His reputation .and authority were
so high in Europe at the beginning of the
sixteenth century, and his works were read with
such universal admiration, that the effead of these
deserves to be mentioned as one of the circunr.
itances which cotntributed moflt considerably
towards Luther's success. Erasmus, having been
destined for the church, and trained up in the
knowledge of ecclesiastical literature , applied
himself more to theological inquiries than any
of the revivers of learning in that age. His
acute judgment and vaif erudition enabled him
to discover many errors, both in the doarine
and worship of the Romih church. Some of
these he confuted with great solidity of reason-
ing, and force of eloquence. Others he treated
as objects of ridicule, and turned against them
that irresistible torrent of popular and satirical
wit, of which he had the command. There was
scarcely any opinion or pradice of the Romif:
- church which Luther endeavoured to reform, but
what had .been previously animadverted upon by
Erasmus, and had afforded him fubjed either of
censure or of raillery. When Luther first began
his attack upon the church, Erasmus seemed to
applaud his condut; he courted the frien'dlip
of several of his disciples and patrons, and con-

demned the behaviour and spirit of his adverfa- BooK IL,
ries '. He concurred openly with him in inveigh- 1z5o,
ing against the fchool-divines, as the teachers of
a system equally unedifying and obscure. He
joined him in endeavouring to turn the attention
of men to the study of the holy scriptures, as the
only standard of religious truth ".

VARIOUS circumstances, however, prevented
Erasmus from holding the fame course with
Luther. The natural timidity of his temper; his
want of that force of mind which alone can
prompt a man to assume the charadter of a reform-
er 4"; his excessive deference for persons in high
station; his dread of losing the pensions and
other emoluments, which their liberality had
conferred upon him; his extreme love of peace,
and hopes of reforming abuses gradually, and by

"4 Erasmus himself is candid enough to acknowledge this :

" Luther, " says he, " has given us many a wholesome
do0t&ine, and many a good counrfel. I wish he had not deA
seated the effect of .them by intolerable faults. But if he
had written every thing in the most unexceptionable mari.
ner, I had no inclination to die for the fake of truth.

j ~ z o.. gentle methods ; all concurred in determininj

him not only to repress and to moderate tl
zeal, with which he had once been animat,
against the errors ofthe church 49; but to affuq
the character of a mediator between Luther am
his opponents. But though Erasmus soon bega
to censure Luther as, too daring and impetuous
and was at last prevailed upon to write again
him, he must, nevertheless, be considered as hi
forerunner and auxiliary in this war upon tl
church. He first scattered the feeds which Luthe
cherished and brought to maturity. His raillery a'
oblique censures prepared the way for Luther
invetives and more dired attacks. In this ligi
Erasmus appeared to the zealous defenders of t|
Romish church in 'his, own times ". In this li g
he must be considered by every person converfa
.in the history of that period. *

IN this long enumeration of the circumstance

which combined in favouring the progress o
Luther's opinions, or in weakening the refiftanc
of his adversaries, I have avoided entering int(
any discussion of the theological dodrines ao

hd how destitute of any foundation in reason,

in the word of God, or in the pratice of the
primitive church, leaving those topicks entirely
;o ecclesiastical historians, to whose province they
peculiarly belong. But when we add the effect of
;hefe religious considerations to the influence of
political causes, it is obvious that the united
operation of both on the human mind, must
have' been sudden and irresistible. Though, to
Luther's contemporaries , who were too near
perhaps to the scene, or too deeply interested in
t, to trace causes with accuracy, or to examine
them with coolness, the rapidity with which
his opinions spread, appeared to be so unaccount-
ble, that some of themn impited it to a certain
ncommon and malignant position of the stars,
which scattered the. spirit of giddiness and inno-
vation over the world ~ , it is evident, that
he success of the Reformation was the natural
effet of many powerful causes prepared by pecu-
liar providence, and happily conspiring to that
end. This attempt to investigate these causes,
and to throw light on an event so singular and
important, will not, perhaps, be deemed an
unnecessary digression. -- I return from it to
the course of the history.

1.i1. fbme regulations with regard to the internal

police of the Empire. The jurifdicion. of the
imperial chamber was confirmed, and the forms
of its proceeding rendered more fixed and
regular. A council of regen'cy was appointed
, to assist Ferdinand in the government of the
Empire during his brother's absence; which,

as well as the multiplicity of his affairs, was an

to secure the Pope's friendship, this determined Ix i,
him to treat Luther with great severity, as the
most effecual method of soothing Leo into a
concurrence with his measures. His eagerness
to accomplish this, rendered him not unwilling
to gratify the papal legates in Germany, who
anfifted that, without any delay or formal deli-
beration, the diet ought to condemn a man
whom the Pope had already excommunicated
as an incorrigible heretick. Such an abrupt
manner of proceeding, however, being deemed
unprecedented and unjust by the members of
the diet, they made a point of Luther's appear-He is ,m.

mained nine months , and which he frequentlyi
called his Patmos, after the name of that island
to which the apostle John was banished, he
exerted his usual vigour and induffry in defence
of his dodrines, or in confutation of his adver-

ture , still retained a greater love of tearning,
and fironger habits of application to it, than
are common among princes of so adive a dif-
position,, and such violeht patfions. Being amrn
bitious .of ac.quiring glory ps every kind, as welt
as zealously attached to the Romish church, and
Pighly exasperated against Luther, who had
treated Thomas Aquinas, his favourite author,
with great contempt, Henry did not think it
enough to exert his royal authority in opposing
the opinions of the reformer, but resolved like.
wife to combat them with fcholaftick weapons.
With this view he published his treatise oi the
Seven Sacraments, which, though forgotten afc
present, as books of controversy always are,
wlven the occasion that produced them is past,
is not destitute of polemical ingenuity and acute,
ness, and was represented by the flatte.ry of his
courtiers to be a work of such wonderful science
apd learning, as exalted him no less above other
authors in merit, than he was distinguished
among them by his rank, The Pope, ,to whom
it was presented with the greatest formaJity in
full confiflory, spoke of it in such terms,, as if'
it had' been didated by immediate *inspiration;

and as a teftimnony of the gratitude of the church BooK II.
for his extraordinary zeal, conferred on him the x sz'i
title of Defender of the Faith, an appellation
which Henry soon forfeited in the' opimnon of
those from whom. he derived it, and which is
frill retained by his successors, though the avowed
enemies of those opinions, by contending for
which he merited that honourable diftintiori'.
Luther, who was not overawed either by the Luther's
authority of the University, or the dignity of ~,Pl top
-the Monarch, soon published his animadverfions
on both in a style no less vehement and severe,
than he would have used in confuting his
meanest antagonist. This indecent boldness,
inst.ead of thocking his contemporaries, was
considered by them as a new proof of his un-
daunted spirit. A controversy managed by dif-
putants so illustrious, drew more general atten-
tion; and such was the contagion of the spirit
of innovation, diffufed through Europe in that
age, and so powerful the evidence which accom-
panied the doctrines of the reformers on their
first publication, that, in spite both of the, civil
and ecclesiastical powers combined against them,
they daily gained converts both in France and
in England.

How 'defirous soever the Emperor might be stante oaf

to put a stop to Luther's progress, he was often fairs be-

N4

SOOK II, obliged , during the diet at Worms, to turn his

a2I,. thoughts to matters still more interesting, and
tween which demanded more immediate attention. A.
Charles and
Pranis. war was ready to break out between him and

Francis in Navarre, in the Low Countries, and"
in Italy; and it required either great address t6;
avert the danger, or timely and wife precautions!
to- resist it. Every circumstance, at that junc-
ture, inclined Charles to prefer the former mea-
sure. Spair was torn with intestine commo-
tions. In Italy, he had not hitherto secured
the afliftance of any one ally. In the Lowy,7
Countries, his fubjets trembled at the thoughts
of a rupture with France, the fatal effects of
which on their commerce they had often expe-.
rienced. From these considerations , as well as
from the solicitude of Chievres, during his whole
administration, to maintain peace between the
two monarchs, proceeded the Emperor's back-
wardhefs to commence hostilities. But Francis
and his ministers did not breathe the fame
pacific spirit. He easily foresaw that concord
could not long subsist, where interest, emula-
tion, and ambition conspired to dissolve it; and
he poffeffed several advantages which flattered
Bim with the hopes of surprising his rival, and
of overpowering him before he could put him-
self in a posture of defence. The French
King's dominions, from their compact situation,

from their fubjedion to the royalauthority, from BooK ITL
the genius of the people, fond of war, and iszx.
attached to their sovereign by every tie of duty
and affedion, were more capable of a great or
sudden effort, than the larger but disunited ter-
[ ritories of the Emperor, in one part of which
the people were in arms against his ministers,
and in all his prerogative was more limited than
that of his rival,

'JTHE only princes, in whose power it was to HenriVII.

flame on its first appearance, either negleAed to
exert themselves, or were acive in kindling and

to assume the name of mediator, and both par-
ties made frequent appeals to him, had laid
aside the impartiality which suited that character.
Wolsey, by his artifices, had estranged him so
entirely from the French King, that he secretly
fomented the discord which he ought to have
composed, and waiied only for some decent
pretext to join his arms to the Emperor's ".

overturn the system, which after much blood,
shed, and riany negociations, was now efta
blifhed in Italy. Accordingly Leo, who inftanti
discerned the propriety of this condud , had
formed a scheme upon Charles's promotion to
the Imperial dignity, of rendering himself the
umpire between the rivals , by soothing them
alternately, while he entered into no close con
federacy with either; and a Pontiff less ani
bitious and enterprizing , might have saved Eu-
rope from many calamities by adhering to this
plan. But this high-fpirited prelate, wh6 was
fill in the prime of life, longed passionately to
diftinguiih his pontificate by forne splendid
agion. He was impatient to wash away the
infamy of having loft Parma and Placentia, the
acquisition of which refleded so much lustre on
the administration of his predecessor Julius. He
beheld, with the indignation natural to Italians
in that age, the dominion which the Tranfal-
pine, or as they, in imitation of the Roman art
brgance, denominated them, the barbarous na.
tions, had attained in Italy. He flattered himself,
that after assisting the one monarch to strip the
other of his poffeffions in that country, -.he

Italy to the liberty and happiness which it ene x s21.
joyed before the invaflon of Charles VIII:. when
every state was governed by its native princes,
or its own laws, and unacquainted with a foQ
reign yoke. Extravagant and chimerical as this
project may seem, it was the favourite objet
of almost every Italian eminent for genius or
enterprize during great part of the sixteenth
century. They vainly hoped, that by superior
(kill in the artifices and refinements of negocia-
tion, they should be able to baffle* the efforts
of. nations, ruder indeed than themselves, but
much more powerful and warlike. So alluring
was the profpeft of this to Leo, that notwith-
standing the gentleness of his disposition, and
his fondness for the pleasures of a refined and
luxurious ease, he hastened to disturb the peace
of Europe, and to plunge himself in a danger-
ots war, with an impetuosity scarcely inferior
to that of the turbulent and martial Julius ".

IT was in Leo's power, however, to chufe
which of the monarchs he would take for his "
confederate against the other. Both of them
courted his friendship ; he wavered for some
time between them, and at first concluded an
alliance with Francis. The obj:e& of this treaty

and acive spirit of Francis , seconded by thi

of the flow and wary councils of the Emper6i
and that they might over-run with ease this 'd

for defence, and always the prey of every in;

covering too openly his suspicions of Leo's firn
cerity, difippomted these hopes ; whether the
treaty was only an artifice of the Pope's, to cover
the more serious negociations which he was car-

knowing that he might presume so far on Henry's

quests of small importance. In the neighbour-

tion, an error with which he cannot be often
charged, he loft an opportunity of cutting off
the whole Imperial army" ; and what was still
of more consequence, he disgusted the constable of.
Bourbon, by giving the command of the van to

1Pduch time was spent in inquiring who had be.

the blame of that on Francis, he hoped to justify1

came next to be considere~d; but with 'regard
to. these, the Emperor's proposals were such as
discovered either that he was utterly averse to
peace, or that he knew Wolsey would approve
of whatever terms ihould be offered in his name.
He demanded the restitution of the dutchy of
Burgundy, a province,, the poffefIion of which
would have given him access into the heart of
the kingdom; and required a discharge of the
homage duet to the crown of France for the
counties of Slanders and Artois, which none of
his ancestors had. ever refused, and which he
had bound himself by the treaty of Noyon, to
renew. These terms, to which an high-fpirited
Prince would scarcely have listened , after the
disasters of the mos unfortunate. war, Francis
rejeced with great disdain; and Charles shew-

as much refpeA and magnificence as if he had

Wolsey, in his mafter's name, concluded a
league with the Emperor against Francis ; ia
which it was stipulated, that Charles should in-
vade France on the fide of Spain, and Henry
in Picardy, each with ain army of forty thousand
men; and that, in order to strengthen their
union, Charles should espouse the Princess Mlary,
Henry's only child, and the apparent heir of his

Francis had done him, in permitting the Duke
of Albany, the head of a fa6tion in Scotland,
which oppofed' his interest, to return into that
kingdom. He was influenced, however, by
other considerations. The advantages which
accrued to his fubjeds from maintaining an
exad neutrality, or the honour that resulted to
himself from ading as the arbiter between the
contending- Princes, appeared to his youthful
imagination so inconsiderable, when compared
with the glory which Charles and Francis reaped
from leading armies or conquering provinces,
that he determined to remain no longer in a
state of inadivity. Having once taken this re-
solution, his inducements to prefer an alliance
with Charles were obvious. He had no claim
Supon any part of that Prince's dominions, most
of which were so situated, that he could not
attack them without great difficulty, and dif-
advantage; whereas several maritime provinces
of France had been long in the hands of the
Englifh'monarchs, whose pretensions, even to
the crown of that kingdom, were not as yet
altogether forgotten; and the poffeffion of Ca-
hais not only gave him easy access into some of
these provinces, but in cafe of any 4ifafter, as-

forded him a secure retreat. While Charles BooK II.
attacked France upon one frontier, Henry flat- 1 xz.
tered himself that he would find little resistance
on the other , and that the glory of' re-annexing
to the crown of England the ancient inheritance
of its monarchs on the continent , was reserved
for his reign. Wolsey artfully encouraged these

i

vain hopes, which led his master into such mea-
lures as were most subservient to his own secret
schemes ; and the English , whose hereditary
animosity against the French was apt to rekindle
on every occasion , did not disapprove of the

retire, if he did not either advance the pay

rashness of the latter, which must be attended
with certain deftrudion, as the enemy occupied
a camp naturally of great strength, and which

their valour was capable of surmounting every

unable to overcome their obitinacy, complied
with their request, hoping, perhaps, that some
of those unforeseen accidents which so often
,determine the fate of battles, might crown this
rash enterprize with undeserved success ; and
convinced that the effeds of a defeat could not
be more fatal than those which would certainly
follow upon the retreat of a body which corn-

which he had already made, as'well as by the
sums he expended on his pleasures, he had re-
course to extraordinary-expedients for supplying
it. Several new offices were created, and exposed
to sale ; the royal demefnes were alienated;
unusual taxes were imposed; and the tomb of
St. Martin was stripped of a rail of massive silver,
with which Louis XL. in one of his fits of devo-
tion had encircled it. By means of these expe-
dients he was enabled to levy a considerable
army, and to put the' frontier- towns in a good
posture of defence. Boox IL22

THE Emperor, meanwhile, was no less soli- Charles
citous to draw as much advantage as poffiblefi E"n
from the accession of such a powerful ally; and
the prosperous situation of his affairs, at this
time, permitting him to set out for Spain, where
his presence was extremely necessary, he visited
the court of England in his way to that coun-
try. He proposed by this interview not only
to strengthen the bonds of friendship which
united him with Henry, and to excite him to
push the war against France with vigour, but
hoped to remove any disgust or resentment that
Wolsey might have conceived on account of the
cruel disappointment which he had met with in
the late conclave. His success exceeded his
most .sanguine expectations; and by his artful

Boort IL address , during a residence of fix weeks i
l-zz. England, he gained not only the King and the

minister, but the nation- itself. Henry, whol
vanity was sensibly flattered by such a visit, a
well as by the studied refpedt with which th
Emperor treated him on every occasion, entered
warmly into all his schemes. The Cardinal
foreseeing from Adrian's age and infirmities,

forgot his resentment; and as Charles, beside
augmenting the pensions which he had alread
*fettled on him, renewed his promise of favour
ing his pretensions to the papacy, with all hi
interest, he endeavoured to merit the former
and to secure the accomplishment of the latter
by fresh services. The nation, sharing in the glor
of its monarch, and pleased with the confidenc
which the Emperor placed in the English, b
creating the earl of Surrey his high - admiral,
discovered no less inclination to commence hofi

tions, by intercepting their convoys, attacking
their advanced posts, and harassing them con-

custom, an account of) his conduat in that as-

thought inexcusable, burst open the gates of the

unhappy Tordefillas, dragged him through the
streets, with a thousand curses and insults, to-
wards the place of publick execution. In vain
did the dean and canons come forth in procession
with the holy sacrament, in order to appease their
rage. In vain did the monks of those niona-

their knees to spare his life, or at least to allow
him time to confers, and to receive absolution

either of humanity or religion, they cried out,

they were burnt in effigy, their houses razed to

would abandon the walls, in order to save their

to which he had recourse served only to increase
their fury, and he was rep'u'lfed with great in-

one of the most considerable at that time in
Spain, and the great mart for the manufadures

warehouses were then filled with goods for the
approaching fair, the loss was immense, and was
felt universally. This, added to the impression

which such a cruel adion made on a people long
unaccuftomed' to the horrors of civil war, en-
raged the Caftilians almost to madness. Fonseca
became the objec of general indignation, and
was branded with the name of incendiary, and
enemy to his country. Even the citizens of
Valladolid, whom the presence of the cardinal
had hitherto restrai-ned, declared that they could
no longer remain inadive fpedators of the fuffer-

no less fury than the other cities, they burnt

THE Cardinal, though virtuous and disinter- Adrian di.f-

neither the courage nor sagacity necessary at such
a dangerous jundure. Finding himself unable
to check these outrages committed under his
own eye, he attempted to appease the people,
by protesting that Fonseca had exceeded' his
orders, and had by his rash condud offended
him, as .much as he had injured them. This
condescension, the effed of irresolution and ti-
midity, rendered the malecontents bolder and

. 3

{53^, after recalled Fonseca, and dismissed his troops,

which he could no longer afford to pay, as the
treasury, drained by the rapaciousness of the
Flemilh ministers, had received no supply from
the great" cities,,: which were all in arms, the
people were left at full liberty to ad without

commons ofragei they aimed at obtaining redress of their
8tIiIe, political grievances, and an establishment of

publick liberty on a secure basis, objeds worthy
of all the zeal which they discovered in cone
tending for them. The feudal government in
Spain was at that time in a tflate more favour.
able to liberty than in any other of the great
Europeas. kingdoms. This was owing chiefly,
to the number? of great cities in that country,
a. circumstance I have already taken notice of,
and which contributed more than any other to
mitigate the rigour of the feudal institutions, and
to introduce a more liberal and equal form of
government. The inhabitants of every city
formed a great corporation, with valuable immu-
nities and privileges;, they were delivered from
it Rate of fubjedion and valra!age; they were

admitted to a considerable share .in the legifla-
ture; they. acquired the arts of industry, with-
out which cities cannot subsist; they accumu-
lated wealth, by. engaging in commerce; and
being free and independent themselves, were the
guardians of the publick freedom and indepen-
dence. The genius of the internal government
eltablifhed in cities, which even in countries
where defpotick power prevails most, is democra-
tical and republican, rendered the idea of liberty
familiar and dear to them. Their representatives
in the Cortes were accustomed, with equal spirit,
to check the encroachments of the King, and the
oppression of the nobles. They endeavoured to
extend the privileges of their own order; they
laboured to lhake off the remaining incum-
brances with which the feudal tyranny had bur-
dened them; and conscious of being one of the
most considerable orders in the. state, were; am-
bitious of becoming the most powerful. BfOOrK III..

and the government committed to a stranger, o'df
great virtue indeed, but of abilities unequal to
such a trust. The first care of Padilla, and the
other popular leaders who observed and detei.
mined to improve these circumstances, was to

the malecontents, that they might at with
greater regularity, and pursue one common end;
and as 'the different cities had been prompted
to take' arms by the fame motives, and were
accuffomed to confider themselves as a diftindt:
body from the reft of the fubjeds, they did not
find this difficult. A general convention was
appointed to be held at Avila. Deputies, ap-
peared there in name of almost all the cities en.

all bound themselves by fdlemn oath, to live and

with the miserable condition of her Castilian

The Junta, relying on the unanimity with iwhich concerning
the nation submitted to their authority, elated their griev
with the success which hitherto had accompanied
all their undertakings, and feeing no military
force colleded to defeat or obftrud their de-
signs, aimed at a more thorough reformation of
political abuses. They had been employed for
some time in preparing a remonstrance, contain-
ing a large enumeration not only of the griev-

new regulations as they thought necessary for
the security of their liberties. This remon-

which other nations have laboured to procure in

Th egrievances complained of, and the reme,

now insisted. But the principles of liberty seen
to have been better underfltood at this period,
by the Carfilians , than by any other people
in Europe; they had acquired more liberal
ideas with refpe & to their own rights and
privileges ; they had formed more bold and
generous sentiments concerning government;
and discovered an extent of political knowledge
to which the Englilh themselves did not attain
until more than a century afterwards.

IT, is not improbable, however', that the spirit

of reformation among the Caftilians, hitherto
urireftrained by authority, and emboldened by
success, became too impetuous, and prompted
the Junta 'to propose innovations which, by
alarming the other members of the constitution;

proved fatal to their cause. The nobles, vrho, BOOK III.

the measures of the commons tended no less to
break the power of the aristocracy l than to
limit the prerogatives of the crown. The resent-
ment which th-ey had conceived on account of
Adrian's promotion to the regency, abated conk
fiderably upon the Emperor's raising the cond
stable and admiral' to joint power with him in
that office; and as their pride and dignity were
less hurt by fuffering the Prince to possess ail
extensive prerogative, than by admitting the
high pretensions of the people, they determined
to give their sovereign the assistance which he
had demanded of them, and began to assemble
their vassals for that purpose.

THE Junta, meanwhile , expeted with im1- The depw-

The regents THE regents, meanwhile, appointed Riofedc
and nobles as the place of rendezvous for their troops,

which, though far inferior to those of the cor.
mnons in number, excelled them greatly in dif-
cipline and in valour. They had drawn a con.
fiderable body of regular and veteran infantry
out of Navarre. Their cavalry, which formed
the chief strength of their army, 'confifted mostly
of gentlemen accustomed to the military life,
and animated with the martial spirit peculiar to
their order in that age. The infantry of the
Junta was formed entirely of citizens and mechay
nicks, little acquainted with the use of arms.
The small body of cavalry whlich they had been
able to raise, was compeofed of persons of ignpble
birth, and perse fitrangers to the service into
which they entered. The charadter of the gene,
rals differed no less than that of their troops.
The royalists were commanded by the Conde
de Haro , the conftable's eldest son, an officer
of great experienre , and of distinguished abi·
lities.

around it, hoped that the royalists would be, BOOK III.
obliged either to surrender for want of provi- I1 22.
fions, or to fight with disadvantage before allsge"nera of
their troops were assembled. But he had not
the abilities, nor his troops the patience and-
discipline necessary for the execution of such a
scheme. The Conde de Haro found little diffi-
culty in conducting a considerable reinforce-
ment through all his posts into the town; and
Giron despairing of being able to reduce it,.
advanced suddenly to Villa-panda, a place be-
longing to the Constable, in which the enemy
had their chief magazine of provisions. By
this ill-judged motion, he left Tordefillas open
.to the royalists, whom the Conde de Haro led
thither in the night, with the utmost secrecy December s.

WHAT they stood most in need of, was mo-Their ex-

ney to pay t!heir troops. A great part of: the pedients for
current coin had been carried out of the king- mran
dom by the Flemings; the Rated taxes levied
in times of peace were inconsiderable; commerce
of every kind being interrupted by the war,
the fum. -which they yielded decreased daily;
and the Junta were afraid of disgusting the peo-
ple by burdening them with new impositions,
to which, in that age, they were little accuf-
tomed. But from this. difficulty they were ex-
tricated by Donna Maria Pacheco , Padilla's
wife, a woman of noble birth, of great abilities,,
of boundless ambition, and animated with the
most ardent zeal in support of the cause of the
Junta. She, with a boldness superior to those
superstitious fears which often influence her sex,
proposed to seize all ':the rich and magnificent
ornaments in the cathedral of Toledo; but left
that action, by its appearance of impiety, might
offend the people, the and her retinue marched
to the church in solemn procession, 'in mourn-
ing habits , with tears in their eyes, beating
their breasts, and falling on their knees, im-
plored the pardon of the :faints whose shrines
ihe was about to violate. By this artifice, which,

and persuaded the people that necessity and zeal
for a good cause had constrained her, though
with reludance, to venture upon this adion, the
procured a considerable supply of money for the
Junta "'. The regents, no less at a loss how to
maintain their troops, the revenues of the crown
having either been dissipated by the Flemings,
or seized by the commons, were obliged to take
the Queen's jewels, together with the plate
belonging to the nobility, and apply them to
that purpose; and when those failed, they ob.
tained a small fum by way of loan from the King
of Portugal ".

THE nobility discovered great unwillingnefi

to proceed to extremities with the Junta. They
were animated with no ' less hatred than' the
commons against the Flemings; they approved
much of several articles in the remonstrance;
they thought the iuncture favourable, not only
for redressing pall grievances, but for rendering
the constitution more perfect and secure by new
regulations; they were afraid, that while the two
orders of which the legislature was composed,
wasted each other's strength by mutual hostilities,
the Frown would rife to power on the ruin or

weakness of both, and encroach no less on the
independence of the nobles, than on the privi-
leges of the commons. To this disposition were
owing the frequent overtures of peace which the
regents made to the Junta, and the continual
negociations they carried on during the progress
of their military operations. Nor were the terms
which they offered unreasonable; for on con-
dition that the Junta would pass from a few
articles most subversive of the royal authority,
or inconsistent with the rights of the nobility,
they engaged to procure the Emperor's consent
to their other demands, which, if he, through
the influence of evil counsellors., should refuse,
several of the nobles promised to join with them
in order to extort it ", Such divisions, however,
prevailed among the members of the Junta , as
prevented their deliberating calmly, or judging
with prudence. Several of the cities which had
entered into the confederacy, were filled with
that mean jealousy and distrust of each other ,
which rivalfhip in commerce or in grandeur is
apt to inspire; the constable, by his influence
and promises, had prevailed on the inhabitants
of Burgos to abandon the Junta, and other
noblemen had Ihaken the fidelity of ,ome of the
lesser cities; no person had arisen among the
commons of such superior abilities or elevation

xSz. affairs; Padilla, their general, was a man' of

popular qualities, but difirufted for that reiafon
by those of highest, rank who adhered to the
Junta; the conduct of Giron led the people to
view with suspicion -every person of noble birth
who joined their party; so that the ftrongelt
anarks of irresolution, mutual distrust, and .me.
diocrity of genius, appeared in all their pro<
ceedings at this time. After many consultations
held concerning the terms proposed by the re.
gents, they fuffered themselves to be so carried
away by resentment against the nobility, that
rejeCting all thoughts of accommodation, they
threatened to strip them of the crown-lands,
which they or their ancestors had usurped ,- and
to re-annex these to the royal domain. Upon
this preposterous scheme, which would at., once
have annihilated all the liberties for which they
had been struggling, by rendering the Kings of
Castile absolute and independent on their sub.
jeAs, they were so intent, that they now ex.
claimed with less vehemence against the exac

.immense power and wealth of the nobles, an(

the royalists. Padilla, that his army might not
reniaininadcive, while flushed with good fortune,
laid siege to Torrelobaton, a place of greater
strength and importance than any that he had
hitherto attacked, and which was defended by
a fufficient garrison; and though the besieged
made a desperate resistance, and the admiral
attempted to relieve them, he took theotown byM arch 3,
storm, and gave it up to be plundered by his Ia'r-
soldiers. If he had marched instantly with his
victorious army to Tordefillas, the head quarters
of the royalists, he could hardly have failed of
making an effectual impression on their troops,
furprized at the briflknefs of his operations, and
far from being of fufficient strength to give him
battle. But the fickleness and imprudence of the
Junta prevented his taking this step. Incapable, Imprudence
like all popular associations, either of carrying ftheir con
on war, or of making peace, they listened again
to overtures of accommodation, and even agreed
to a short suspension of arms. This negociation
terminated in nothing; but while it was carrying

had leisure to assemble his forces at Burgos;
and to prepare every thing for marching; -and as
soon as the truce expired, he effeded. a junction
with the Conde de Haro, in spite of all Padilla's
efforts to prevent it. They advanced immediately
towards Torrelobaton, and Padilla finding thB

circumstances so disconcerted and intimidated
raw soldiers, that without facing the enemy, or
making any resistance, they fled ini the utmost anad def

them, though in vain; fear rendering them deaf
both to his threats and intreaties: Upon which,
finding matters irretrievable, and resolving not
to survive the disgrace of that day, and the ruin
of his party, he ruffed into the thickest of the
enemy; but. being wounded and dismounted, he
was taken prisoner. His principal officers shared
the fame fate; the common soldiers were al-

generous to kill men who threw down their

Fatal effeas this bold attempt of the commons, like all un.
o this civil ccefsful infurredions , contributed to confirm

and extend the power of the crown, which it
was intended to moderate and abridge. The
Cortes still continued to make a part of the Caf.
tilian constitution , and were summoned to meet
nwhenever the King stood in need of money ;
but instead of examining and redressing publick
grievances, before they proceeded to grant any
supply, the more courtly custom of voting a
donative in the first place was introduced, and
the Sovereign having obtained all that he wanted,
never allowed them to enter into any inquiry,
or to a-ttempt any reformation injurious to his
authority. The privileges which the cities had
enjoyed were gradually circumscribed or abao
hifhed ; their commerce began from this period
to decline; and becoming ]efs wealthy and less

The members of it , upon pretext of defending
the c9asts against the descents of the Corfairs of
Barbary, and under fandion of that permission,
which Charles had rashly granted them, refused
to lay down their arms. But as the grievances,
which the Valencians aimed at redressing, pro-
ceeded from the arrogance and exadions of the
nobility , rather than from any unwarrantable
exercise of the royal prerogative , their resent-
ment turned chiefly against the former. As
soon as they-were allowed the use of arms, and
became conscious of their own strength , they
grew impatient to take vengeance of their op--
preffors. They drove the nobles out of most
of the cities , plundered their houses, wasted
their lands, and assaulted their castles. They
then proceeded to eled thirteen persons , one
from each company- of tradesmen established in
Valencia, and committed the administration of
government to them , under pretext that they
would reform the laws, establish one uniform
mode of dispensing justice without partiality,
or .regard' to the diftindion of ranks , and thus
restore men to some degree of their

i a well as troops of the confederacy were con.

laws introduced in civilized nations, in order to
restrain or moderate the violence of war, were
-unknown or despised ; and they committed the
wildest ads of cruelty and outrage.

the tumults in Valencia , and left the nobility

raised among their vassals. The Germanada
carried on the war during the years one thou-

have been expeded from a body fb tumultuary,

though not considerable, were extremely sharp.
They repulsed them in their attempts to reduce
different towns. But the nobles, by their fupe-

modre aecuftomed to service, gained the advan-
tage in nioft of the rencounters. At length,
they were joined by a body of Castilian cavalry,
which the regents dispatched towards Valencia,
soon after their victory over Padilla at Villalar,
and by their affillance they acquired such fupe.

Nor did his political views and. maxims feei

A great part of it was quartered in the eccd,

oppression, and were impatient to be delivered

with great firmness to their alliance with Francis,
being now convinced that his affairs in Italy
were in a desperate situation, entered into a
league against him with the Emperor; to which

states followed their example; and Francis was
left, without a tingle ally, to resist the efforts
of so many enemies, -whose armies threatened,
and whose territories encompassed, his dominions
on every fide "3

'THE dread of this powerful confederacy, it Francis9s
was thought, would have 'obliged Francis to vigorous
keep wholly on the defensive, or at least have oppofitiod
prevented his entertaining any thoughts oft" i.

of that Prince, too apt to become remiss, and
even negligent on ordinary occasions, to rouse
at the approach of danger, and not only to
encounter it with spirit and intrepidity, qualities
Which never forsook him, but to provide against
it with diligence and industry. Before his ene-
mies were ready to execute any of their fchemeg,
Francis had assembled a numerous army. His
authority over his own fubjeAs was far greater
than that which Charles or Henriry poffeffed over
theirs. They depended on thejr diets, their
cortes, and their parliaments for money, which
was usually granted them in small sums , very
slowly, and with much reludance. The taxes

Ss 3. levied with greater dispatch; so that on this, as

well as on other occasions, his army was in the
field while they were devising ways and means
for raising theirs. Sensible of this advantage,
Francis hoped to disconcert all the Emperor's
schemes, by marching in person into the Mila.
nefe; and this bold measure, the more formida.
ble because unexpeted , could scarcely have
failed ,of producing that effec. The vanguard

snfeeaea of his army had already reached Lyons, and he
rpon the himself was hastening after it with the second di.

the confta- .s
,le Bour- domeftick conspiracy which threatened the ruin;
bon's con- of the kingdom, obliged him to stop Ihort, and
fpiracy.

, to alter his measures.

His chai.c-
ter. TuE author of this dangerous plot was Charles,

Duke of Bourbon, lord high constable, whose
noble birth, vast fortune, and high office, raised
him to be the most powerful fubje in France,
as his great talents, equally suited to the field
or the council, and his signal services to the.
crown, rendered him the molft illustrious and
deserving. The near resemblance between the
King and him in many of their qualities, both
being fond of war, and ambitious to excelin
manly exercises, as well as their equality in age,
and their proximity of blood, ought naturally
to have secured him a considerable ihare in that

IVlonarch's favour. But unhappily Louise, the BooK III.
ging's mother, had contra.ed a violent aver- Ij23.
sion to the house of Bourbon, for no better The causes

of his dif-

reason than because Anne of Bretagne, the affetion.
Q(uleen of Louis the Twel h, with whom the
lived in perpetual enmity, dtifcovered a peculiar
attachment to that branch of the royal family;
and the had taught her son,. who was too sus-
ceptible of any impression which the gave him,
to view all the cbnftable's adions with a mean
and unbecoming jealousy. His distinguished
merit at the battle of IMarignano had not been
fufficiently rewarded; he had been recalled
from the government of IVlilan upon very frivo-
bous pretences, and had met with a cold recep-
tion, which his prudent conduct in that difficult
iation did not deserve; the payment of his
pensions had been suspended without any good
cause; and during the campaign of one thdii-
land five hundred and twenty-one, the King, as
has already been related, had affronted him inr
presence of the whole army, by giving the com-
mand of the van to the Duke of Alencon. The
constable, at sirs, bore these indignities with
greater moderation than could have been ex-
peted from an high-fpirited Prince , conscious
of what was due to his rank, and to his services.
Such a multiplicity of injuries, however,, ex-

FOR this purpose she consulted with the chan- Boor III,
cellor Du Prat, a man, who, by a base profti- 1523.
tution of great talents and of superior skill in
his profeffion, had risen to that high office.
By his advice a law-suit was commenced against
the Constable, for the whole estate belonging to
the house of Bourbon. Part of it was claimed
iln the King's name, as having fallen to the
crown; part in that of Louise, as the nearest
heir in blood of the deceased Dutchess. Both
these claims were equally defitute of any foun-
dation in justice; but Louise, by her folicita-
tions and authority, and Du Prat, by employ-
ing all the artifices and chicanery of law, pre-
Wailed on the judges to order the estate to be
sequestered. This unjust decision drove the Con-His secret

alone could 'have didated. He renewed his in-~mperthe
rtrigues in the Imperial court , and flattering
himself that the injuries which he had fuffered
would justify his having recourse to any means
in order to obtain revenge, he offered to transfer
his allegiance from his natural sovereign to the
Emperor, and to assist him in the conquest of
France. Charles, as well as the King of Eng-
land, to whom the secret. was communicated '",
expeding prodigious advantages from his revolt,
were ready to receive him with open arms, and
spared neither promises nor allurements which

Two of these gave the King some intimation of
a mysterious correspondence between their master
and the Count de Rceux, a Flemifhl nobleman
of great confidence with the Emperor. Francis,
who could not bring himself to fufped that the
first Prince of the blood would be so base as to
betray the kinigdom to its enemies, immediately
repaired to Moulins,- where the Constable was
in bed, feigning indisposition, that he might not
be obliged to accompany the King into Italy,
and acquainted -him of the intelligence which *
hie had received.. Bourbon, with great solemnity,
:and the most imposing affedation of ingenuity
}nd candour, asserted his own innocence; and
as his health, he said, was now more confirmed,
he promised to join the army within a few days.
Francis, open and candid himfeif, and too apt
to be deceived by the appearance of those vir-
tues in others , gave such credit to what he said,
that he refused to arrest him, although advised
to take that precaution by his wisest counsellors,
and as if the danger had been over, he con-
tinued his march towards Lyons. The Con- September.
stable set out soon after, seemingly with an in-
tention to follow him; but turning suddenly to !ies to

pr~rent the bad effects of the irreparable error

lhich he had committed. He put garrisons

in 'll the places of strength in the Conftable's
territories. He seized all the genrtlemen whom
he could fufped: of being his associates; and
as he had not hitherto discovered the whole
extent of the confpirator's schemes, nor knew
how far the infedion had spread among his sub.

courage them to make some desperate attempt;
and for that reason relinquished his intention of
leading his army in person into Italy.

HE did not, however, abandon his design on

the Mlilanefe; but appointed admiral Bonnivet
to take the supreme command in his stead, and
to march into that country with an army thirty
thousand strong. Bonnivet did not owe this
preferment to his abilities as a general; for of
all the talents requisite to form a great com-
mander, he poffeffed only personal courage, the
lowest and the most common. But he was the

Wolsey befcirred shimfelf with adivity suitable

him with vain hopes which he' never intended

expeaations and endeavours, had the morti-
fication to fee a Pope eleded, of such an age,
and of so vigorous a constitution , that he could
not comfort himself much with the chance of
surviving him. This second proof fully con-
vinced Wolsey of the Emperor's insincerity, and
it excited in him all the resentment which an
haughty mind feels on being at once difap-
pointed and deceived ; and though Clement en-
deavoured to soothe his vitglitive nature by
granting him a commifion to be legate in Eng-
land during life, with such ample powers as
vested in him almost the whole papal jurifdic-

.tion in that kingdom, the injury he. had received
entirely dissolved the tie which had united him
to Charles, and from that moment he meditated
revenge. It was' necessary, however, to conceal
his intention from his master, and to suspend
the execution of it, until, by a dexterous im-
provement of the incidents which might occur,
he should be able gradually to alienate the King's
affections from the Emperor. For this reason,
he was so far from exprefling any uneasiness on
account of the repulse which he had met with,
that he abounded on' every occasion, private as
well as publick, in declarations of his high fatis-
fa6ion with Clement's promotion39. BOOK III.

such progress as might have been expeded from
its superiority to the enemy in number, he had
recovered and still kept poffeflion of one half of

1524. THE ensuing year opened with events more
Sentiments disastrous to France. Fontarabia was loft by
Popte nthe cowardice or treachery .of its governor. In
Februarys~. Italy, the allies resolved on an early and vigo-

rous effort in order to difpoffefs Bonnivet of
that part of the Milanese which lies beyond the
Tefino. Clement, who, under the pontificates
of Leo and Adrian, had discovered an impla-
cable enmity to France, began now to view the
power which the Emperor was daily acquiring
in Italy, with so much jealousy, that he refused
to accede, as his predecessors had done ; to the
league against Francis, and forgetting private
passions and animofities, laboured with the zeal
vwhich became his charader, to 'bring about a
reconciliation among the contending parties;
But all his endeavours 'were ineffedual; a nu-

,acquainted so , thoroughly with the charaders
of the French commanders, the genius of their
troops, and the strength as .Wel .as weakness of
their armies, as to be of infinite feivice to the
party which he .had joined. But all these ad-
yantages were nearly loft through the Emperor's
inability to raise money fufficient for executing
the various and extensive plans ~bhich he had
:ormed. When his troops were commanded- to Retardel by

As to the latter, the representatives of the Ger-

of the new opinions were far from being the
most numerous or powerful , had pointed out
as the chief grievances of the Empire, those
very pradices of the Romish church against
which Luther and his disciples were accuftoimed
to declaim. Accordingly , in all their contro-

appealed, to Adrian's declaration , and to the

the aversion which all Popes naturally bear tolo~nei

by means very uncanonical, he was afraid of an
assembly that might ,fubjed it to a scrutiny
which it could not stand. He determined,
therefore, by every possible means to elude the
demands of the Germans , both with refped to
the calling of a council , and reforming abuses
in the papal court , which the rashness and ins
capacity of his predecessor had brought upon
him. For this purpose, he made choice of car-
dinal Campeggio , an artful man, often entrusted
by the Popes witli negociations of importance,
as his nuncio to the diet of the Empire affl~m-
bled again at Nuremberg.

greatest good of the church. With regard to
the latter, as the catalogue of grievances did
not reach Rome till: after Adrian's death , and
of consequence had not been regularly laid

vantage, of this circumstance to decline making
any definitive answer to them in Clement's

that their catalogue of grievances contained
many particulars extremely indecent and un.

certain articles for the amendment of some dif-
orders and abuses which prevailed among the

which fell so far short of the 'expectations of the

ment's admonlitions, and declared his resolution
of ordering his army to pass the Alps, and to
invade Provence, a part of his rival's dominions,
where, as he least dreaded an attack, he was least
prepared to resist it. His most experienced
ministers dissuaded him from 'undertaking Tfuch
an enterprize with a feeble army, and an ex.
haufted treasury: But he relied so much on
having' obtained the concurrence of the King of
England, and on the hopes which Boutbon,
with the confidence and credulity natural to
exiles, entertained of being joined by a nume.
rous body of his partisans as soon as the mrpe.
rial troops should enter France, that he persisted
obstinately in the measure. Henry undertook
to furnish an hundred thousand ducats towards
defraying the expence of the expedition during

the first month, and had it in his choice either BO.oK IV.
to continue the payment of that fum monthly, x S4.
or to invade Picardy before the end of July with
a powerful army. The Emperor engaged to
attack Guienne at the fame time with a con-
fiderable body of men; and if these enterprizes
proved fuccefsful, they agreed, that Bourbon,
besides the territories which he had loft, ihould
be put in poffeffion of Provence, with the title
of King, and should do homage to Henry as
the lawful King of France, for his new domi-
nions. Of all the parts of this extensive but
extravagant project, the invasion of Provence
was the only one which was executed. For al-
though Bourbon , with a scrupulous delicacy,
altogether unexpeded after the part which he
had aded, positively refused to acknowledge
Henry's title to the crown of France, and thereby
absolved him from any obligation to promote
the enterprize, Charles's eagerness to carry his
own plan into execution did not in any degree
abate. The army he employed for that purpose
amounted only to eighteen thousand men; the
supreme command of which was given to the
Marquis de Pescara, with inftruAions to pay the
greatest deference to Bourbon's advice in all his
operations. Pescara passed the Alps without The Impe.

cautions to defeat' it. He laid waste the adja,

for the enemy to subsist their army; he razed

under the command of brave and experienced
officers. To these, nine thousand of the citi-
zens, whom their dread of the Spanish yoke in.
spired with contempt of danger, joined them-
selves; by their united courage and industry,
all the efforts of Pefcara's military skill, and of
Bourbon's adivity and revenge, were rendered
abortive. Francis, meanwhile, had leisure to
assemble a powerful army under the walls of
Avignon, and no sooner began to advance to-
wards Marseilles, than the Imperial troops, ex-
bhaufed by the fatigues of a siege which had

on many other occasions, the Emperor found
that the extent of his revenues was not adequate
to the greatness of his power, or the -ardour of
his ambition, and the want of money obliged
him, though with much reludance, to circum-
feribe his plan, and to leave part of it unexe-
cuted. Henry, disgusted at Bourbon's refusing
to recognize his right to the crown of France;
alarmed at the motions of the Scots, whom the
felicitations of the French King had persuaded
to march towards the borders of England; and

obliged to retire almost ruined by hard duty,
and dilheartened with ill success; the IVlilanefe
had been left altogether without defence; it was
not impossible to reach that country before Pes-
cara, with his thattered forces, could arrive there;
or if fear ihould add speed to their retreat, they
were in no condition to make head against his
fresh and numerous troops; and Milan would
now, as in former instances, submit without re-

(stance to a bold invader. These confidera- BooIK IV.
tions, which were not destitute of plausibility, s.4.
appeared to his sanguine temper to be of the
utmost weight. In vain did his wifelt ministers
and generals represent to him the danger of
taking the field at a season so far advanced, with
an army composed chiefly of Swiss and Germans,
to whose caprices he would be fubjea in all his
operations, and on whose fidelity his safety muff
1bfolqtely depend. In vain did Louise of Savoy
Idvance by hasty journies towards Provence,
that she might exert all her authority in diffuad-

lifregarded the remonftrances of his fubjeds; and
that he might save himself the pain of an interview

Though Charles poffeffed - dominions more ex-
tensive than, any other Prince in Europe, and
had, at this. time, no other army but that which
was employedc in Lombardy, which did not
amount to sixteen thousand men, his prerogative
in all his different states was so limited, and his
fubjeas, without whose consent he could raise no
taxes, discovered such unwillingness to burden
themselves with new or extraordinary impositions,
that even this small body of troops was in want
|of pay , of ammunition, of provisions, and of

the wisdom of Lannoy, the intrepidity of Pe.s

to preserve them from sinking .under despair,
and to inspire them with resolution to attempt,
or sagacity to discover, what was essential to
their safety. To the efforts of their genius, and
the ativity of their zeal, the Emperor was more
indebted for the preservation of his Italianr do-
minions than to his own power. Lannoy, by

that the' town would at last be obliged to fur- concludes a

French arms as superior in Italy, became im-
patient to disengage himself from his connec-
tion .with the Emperor, of whose designs he
was extremely jealous, and to enter into terms
of friendship with Francis. As Clement's timid
Ind cautious teinper rendered him incapable .of
following the bold plan which Leo had formed,
rs delivering Italy from the yoke of bot.h the
rivals, he returned to the .more obvious and
pradticable scheme of employing the power of
the one to balance and to restrain that of the

atisfadion at feeing the French King recover

neighbour would be some check upon the Em-
peror's ambition, which. no power in Italy was
now able to controul. ,He laboured hard to
bring about a peace that would secure Francis
in poffeffion of his new conquests ; and as Charles,
swho was always inflexible in the prosecution of
his schemes, rejeaed the proposition with disdain,
and with bitter exclamations against .the Pope,
by whose persuasions, while Cardinal de Me-
dici, he had been induced to invade the Mila-
nefe, Clement immediately concluded a treaty

Bboo IV. of neutgalityawith the King of France, in whic

1sz4. the republick of Florence was included ".

Francis FRANCIS having, by this tranfadtion, deprive
invades the· Binperor of his two most powerful allies
Naples. and at the fame time having secured a paffag

for his own troops through their territories,
formed a scheme of attacking the kingdom o
Naples, hoping either to over-run that country
which was left altogether without defence,
that at least such an lunexpeded invasion wovi
oblige the viceroy to recall part of the Imperim
army out of the Milanese. For this purpose i
ordered fix thousand men to march under tli
command of John Stuart duke of Albany. Bu
Pescara foreseeing that the effed of this diverfi
would depend entirely upon the operations |
the armies in the Milanese, persuaded Lannofy
disregard Albany's motions "', and to bend li
whole force against the King himself; so tli

the ignominy that it would. reflet& on their fove-

had prosecuted so long, or turn his back before
an enemy to whom he was still superior in num-
ber; and insisted on the necessity of fighting the
Imperialists rather than relinquish an undertaking,
on the success of which the King's future fame
depended. Unfortunately, Francis's notions of'
honour were delicate to an excess that bordered
on what was romantick. Having often said that
he would take Pavia, or perish in the attempt,
he thought himself bound not to depart from that
resolution; and rather than expose himself to the
fligh test imputation, be chose to forego all the
advantages which were the certain consequences
of a retreat, and determined to wait for tle Im-

its escape under the command of the. Duke of rszs.
Alenfon; the feeble garrison of Milan, on the
first news of the defeat, retired ,without being
pursued, by another road; and in two weeks
after the battle, not a Frenchman remained, in
Italy.

LANNOY, though he treated Francis with all
the outward marks of honour due to his rank
and charaCter, guarded him wi.th the utmost
attention. He was solicitous, not only to pre-
vent any possibility of his escaping, but afraid
that his own troops might seize his person, and
detain it as the best security for the payment
of their arrears. In order to provide against
both these dangers, he conduaed Francis, the
day after the battle , to the strong castle of
Pizzichitone near Cremona, committing him to
the cuatody of Don Ferdinand Alarcon, general
of the Spanish infantry, an officer of great bra-
very and of ftrilt honour, but remarkable for
that severe and scrupulous vigilance which such
:a trust required.

FRANCIS , who formed a judgment of the

Emperor's dispositions by his own,, was ex-
tremely desirous that Charles should be informed
of his situation , fondly hoping that, from his
generosity or sympathy, he should obtain fp'eedy

grandees and foreign ambassadors, assembled ill
order to congratulate him. He accepted of

he lamented the misfortune of the captive King,

fortune, to which the most powerful Monarchs
are fubjed; he forbad any publick rejoicings, as
indecent in a war carried on among Christians,

reserving them until he should obtain a vitory BOOK IV'V
equally illustrious over the Infidels; and seemed 1s25,
to take pleasure in the advantage which he had
Iained, only as it would prove the occasion of
restoring peace to Chriftendomn .

CHARLES, however, had already begun to The

tion required. She colleded the remains of the
aimy which had served in Italy, ranfomed the
prisoners, paid their arrears, and put them in a
condition to take the field. She levied new
troops, provided for the security of the fron-
tiers, and raised sums fufficient for defraying
these extraordinary expences. Her chief care,
however, was to appease the resentment, or tc
gain 'the frienrdfhip of the King of England'
and from that quarter, the first ray of comfori
broke in upon the French affairs.

THOUGH Henry, in entering into alliances Boon IV.
with Charles or Francis, seldom followed any i525.
regular or concerted plan of policy, but wa Effeas of
influenced chiefly by the caprice of temporaryt Paviai ryon
paflions, such occurrences often happened as Henry vxI.
recalled his attention towards that equal balance
of power which it was necessary to keep be-
tween the two contending potentates, the pre-
servation of which he always boasted to be his
peculiar office. He had expeded that his union
with the Emperor might afford him an oppor-
tunity of recovering some part of those territories
in France which had belonged to his ancestors,
and for the fake of such an acquisition he did
not scruple to give his assistance towards raising
Charles to a considerable pre-eminence above
Francis. He had never dreamt, however, of
any event so decisive and so fatal as the victory
at Pavia, which seemed not only to have broken,
.but to' have annihilated the power of one of
the rivals ; so that the profpeCl of the sudden
and entire revolution which this would occasion
in the political system , filled him with the' most
disquieting apprehensions. He law all Europe
in danger of being over-run by an ambitious
Prince, to whose power there now remained no
counterpoise; and though he himself might at
firff be admitted, in quality of an ally, to some
share in the spoils of the captive monarch, i$

J5as5. ner of making the· partition, as well as his

security for keeping poffeffion of what should
be allotted him, he must ,absolutely depend upon
the will of a confederate, to whose forces his
own bore no proportion. He was sensible that
if Charles were permitted to add -any confider.
able part of France to the vast dominions of
which he was already master, his neighbourhood
would be much more formidable to England
than that of the ancient French Kings; while,'
at the fame time, the proper balance on th
continent, to which England owed both its
safety and importance, would be entirely loft;
Concern for the situation of the unhappy mor
narch' co-operated with these political confiderl
ations; his gallant behavioui in the battle of
Pavia had excited an high degree of admiration,
which never fails of augmenting sympathy; and
Henry, naturally susceptible of generous senti.
ments, was fond of appearing as the deliverer
of a vanquished enemy from a slate of captivity.:
The passions of the Englifh' minister seconded
the inclinations of the Monarch. Wolsey, who
had not forgotten the disappointment .of his
hopes in two successive conclaves, which he im-
puted chiefly to the Emperor, thought this a
,proper opportunity of taking revenge; and
LotuiQfe, courting the friendship of England with

ruch flattering submissions as were no less agree-
able to the King than to the Cardinal, Henry
gave her secret assurances that he would not
lend his aid towards oppressing France, in its
present helpless state, and obliged her to pro-
mise that she would not consent to dismember
the kingdom even in order to procure her fon's
liberty ". Booie IV.I

BUT as Henry's connections with the Em-
peror made it necessary to at irt such a manner,
as to save appearances, he ordered publick re-
joicings to be made in his dominions for the
success of the Imperial arms ; and as if he had
been eager to seize the present opportunity of
ruining the French monarchy, he sent ambafla-
dors to Madrid, to congratulate with Charles
upon his viAory; to put him in mind, that he,
s his ally, engaged in one common cause, was
entitled to partake in the fruits of it; and to
require that, in- compliance with the terms of
their confederacy, he would invade Guienne
|with a powerful army, in order to give him pof-
felfion of that province. At the fame time , he
offered to fend the Princess Mary into Spain or
the Low Countries, that the might be educated
under the Emperor's diredion, until the conclu-
fton of the marriage agreed on between them;

him, in consequence of that article in the treaty
of Bruges, whereby each of the contradini
parties was bound to surrender all ufurpers e:

impossible that Henry could expect that the
Emperor would listen to these extravagant dC

much .tolicitude concerning the means of raising
such a force as might obftrudt his progress20.
Biut their consultations, conduded .with little
union, and executed with less vigour, had no
effed. Clement, instead of pursuing the mea-
fures which he had concerted with the Venetians
for securing the liberty of Italy, was so intimi-
dated by Lannoy's threats, or overcome by his
promises, that he entered into a separate treaty,
binding himself to advance a considerable fum
in return for certain emoluments which he was
to receive. The money was jnftantly paid;
p(harles -afterwards refused to ratify the treaty ;
and the Pope remained exposed at once to in-

he had deserted the publick cause for his private

not, perhaps, to be expeded in the condut of

deavouring to make the utmost of Francis's ca
lamity, had a greater number in the council to
recommend it, and suited better with the Emr
peror's genius. But though Charles adopted
this plan, he did not execute it in a proper

VOL. IL Z

JLooK IV. manner. Instead of making one great effort to

5is5. penetrate into France with all the forces of Spain

and the Low Countries; instead of crushing the,
Italian states before they recovered from the
confterna'tion which the success of his arms had
occasioned , he -had recourse to the artifices of
intrigue and negociation. This proceeded partly
from necessity , partly from the natural difpo-
fition of his mind,. The situation of his sinan-
ces, at that time, rendered it extremely difficult
to carry on any extraordinary armament;' and
he himself having never appeared at the head
of his armies, the command of which he had
hitherto committed to his generals, was averse
to bold and martial counsels, and trusted more
to the arts with which he was acquainted, He
laid, betides, too much stress upon the vidory of
'Pavia, as if by that event the strength of France
had been annihilated, its resources exhausted, and,
the kingdom itself, no less than the person of its

- Monarch, had been fdibjedted to his power.

"The rigo- F-ULL of this opinion, he determined to set the
rous terms highest price upon Francis's freedom, and having
te orais. -ord-ered the Count de Roeux to visit the captive

King in his name-, he inftrulted him to propose
the following articles, as the conditions on which
he would grant him his liberty: That he thould
restore Burgundy to the Emperor, from whose
ancestors it had been unjustly wrefte.4; that he

should surrender Provence and Dauphind, that Boo00 IV.
they might be ereaed into an independent ass?
kingdom for the Constable Bourbon; that he
should make full fatisfadion to the King of
England for all his claims, and finally renounce
the pretensions of France to Naples, Milan, of
any other territory in Italy. When Francis,
who had hitherto flattered himself that he should
be treated by the Emperor with the generosity
becoming one great Prince towards another,
heard these rigorous conditions, he was so tranf-
ported with indignation, that drawing his dagger
hastily, he cried, out: "It were better that a
King should die thus.'" Alafcon, alarmed ,at
his vehemence, laid hold on his hand; but
though he soon recovered greater compofudhe
.still declared, in the most solemn manner, that he
would rather remain a prisoner during life, than
purchase liberty by such ignominious conceffions2o

THIS moitifying discovery of the Emperor's i ranici ear-

intentions, greatly augmented Francis's chagrin spriainer
and impatience under his confinement, and must
have driven him to absolute despair, if he had
not laid hold of the only thing which could still
administer any comfort to him. He persuaded
himself that the conditions which Roeux had
proposed, did not flow originally from Charles
himself, but were dictated by the rigorous pot

ance, than could be effeded by long negocia-

proceeded from too favourable an opinion of
the Emperor's charadter, he offered to visit him
in Spain, -and was willing to be carried thither
as a fpedacle to that haughty nation. Lannoy

. emplryed all his address to confirm him in these

fentimnents; and concerted with him in fecre(.
the manner of ex'ecu-ting this resolution. Francis
was so eager on a scheme which seemed to open
some profped of liberty, that he furniihed the
gallies necefthry for the voyage, Charles being
at that time unable to set any fleet to sea. ,The
viceroy without communicati-ng his intentions
either td Bourbon.or Pescara, conduded his pri.
foner towards Genoa, under pretence of tranf-
porting him by sea to Naples; though soon after
they set fail, he ordered the pilots to steer di-
redly for Spain ; but the wind happening to
carry them near the French coast, the unfortu-
nate monarch had a full profped of .his own
dominions, towards which he cast many a'for-
rowful and desiring look. They landed, how-
ever, in a few days at Barcelona, .and soon after
Francis was lodged, by the Emperor's command,

at Madrid with that .neglet which they deserved,
and which he probably expeded. Charles, in-
,toxicated with prosperity, no longer courted him

pleased his haughty temper. Wolsey, no less
haughty than his master, was highly irritated at
the Emperor's discontinuing his wonted caresses

such apparent artifice, as became a full proof to
his suspicious niind, that the Emperor intended

in order to quiet the Pope and Venetians, no
less jealous of his designs than Morone, gave
Sforza, at last, the inveffiture which had been
so long deifired; the charter was clogged with
so many refervatioibs, and fubjeted him to such
grievous-burdens, as rendered the Duke of Milan
a dependent on the Emperor, rather than a vas-

began to revolve in his mind the possibility of
rescuing Italy from the yoke of foreigners, the
darling scheme, as has been already observed,
of the Italian politicians in that age, and which it
was the great objet of their ambition to accom-
plifh. If to the glory of having been the chief
instrument of driving the French out of Milan,
Jhe could add that of delivering Naples from the
dominion of the Spaniards, he thought that no-

vices. It was on this disgust of Pescara, that
IViorone founded his whole fyftein. He knew
the boundless ambition of his nature, the vaflt
extent of his abilities in peace as well as war;
and the intrepidity of his mind, capable alike of
undertaking and of executing the most defpe;
rate designs. The cantonment of the Spanish
troops on, the frontier of the IVlilanefe, gave oc-
cation to many interviews between him andl VIo-
rene, in which the latter took care frequently
to turn the conversation to the tranfadions sub.
sequent to the battle of Pavia, a fubjet upon
which the marquis always entered willingly, and
with paflion; and Morone observing his resent-
ment to be uniformly violent, artfully pointed
out :and aggravated every circumstance that
could increase its fury. He painted, in the
strongest colours, the Emperor's want of dif-
cernment, as well as of gratitude, in preferring

Lannoy to him, and in allowing that prefump- BooK IV.
tuous Fleming to dispose of the captive King, xs
without consulting the man to whose bravery
and wisdom Charles was indebted for the glory
of having him in his power. Having warmed
him by such discourses, he then began to infi-
nuate, that now was the time to be avenged for
these insults, and to acquire immortal renown
as the deliverer of his country from the oppref-
sion of strangers; that the fRates of Italy, weary
of the ignominious and intolerable dominion of
barbarians, were' at last ready to combine in
order to vindicate their own independence; that
their eyes were fixed on him as the only leader-
whose genius and good fortune could ensure the
happy success of that noble enterprize; that the
attempt was no less pradicable than glorious, it
being in his power so to disperse the Spanish in-
fantry, the only body of the Emperor's troops
in Italy , through the villages of the Milanese,
that, in one night, they might be defiroyed by
the people, who, having fuffered much from
their exadions and insolence, would gl'adly un-
dertake this service; that he might then, with-
out opposition, take poffeffion of the throne of
Naples, the station destined for him; and a re-
ward not unworthy the restorer of liberty to
Italy; that the Pope, of whom that kingdom
Beld, and whose predecessors had disposed of it

BOOK IV. on many former occasions, would willingly grant

S1z25, him the right of investiture; that the Venetians,

the Florentines, the Duke of Milan, to whom he
had communicated the scheme, together with the
French, would be the guarantees of his right;
that the Neapolitans would naturally prefer the
government of one of their countrymen, whom
they loved and admired, to that odious domit'
nion of firangers, to which they had been so
long fubjeaed; anda that the Emperor, afto0
nifhed at a blow so unexpe&ed, would find that
he had neither troops nor money to resist such
a powerful confederacy ".

the infamy of betraying his sovereign under
whom he bore such high command, deterred
him from the attempt; on the other, the pro.
sped of obtaining a crown allured him to ven.
ture upon it. After continuing a short space
in suspense, the least commendable motives, as
is usual 'after such deliberations, prevailed, and
ambition triumphed over honour. In order,

however, to throw a colour of decency on his BOOK .IV-
conduc , he insisted ,that some learned cafuifts

x ~ .,

Thould give their opinion, a Whether it was.
lawful for a fubje& to take arms against his im-
mediate sovereign , in obedience to the Lord
Paramount of whom the kingdom itself was
held. " Such a resolution of the cafe, as he ex-
peded, was soon obtained from the divines and
civilians both of Rome and IVIilan; the nego-
ciation went forward; and m e'afures seemed to
be taking with great spirit for the speedy exe-
cution of the design.

DURING this interval, Pescara, either shocked
at the treachery of the adion that he was going
to commit, or despairing of its success, began to
entertain thoughts of abandoning the engage-
ments which he had come under. The indifpo-
fition of Sforza, who happened at that time to
be taken ill of a distemper which was thought
mortal, confirmed this resolution, and deter-
mined himn to make known the whole conspiracy
to the Emperor, deeming it more prudent to
exped the. dutchy 6f Milan from him as the
reward of this discovery, than to aim at a king-
dom to be purchased by a series of crimes.
This resolution, however, proved the source of
a&ions hardly less criminal and ignominious.
The Emperor, who had already received full
idformation concerning the' conspiracy froi,

D$oR LiV, other hands, seemed to be highly pleased with

Pefcara's fidelity, and commanded' him to con.
tinue his intrigues for some time with the Pope
and Sforza, both that he might discover their
intentions more fully, and be able to convijC
them of the crime with greater certainty. Pes.
cara, conscious of guilt, as well as fenfible.how
suspicious his long silence must have appeared
at Madrid, durst not decline that dishonourable
office; and, to his eternal disgrace,, was obliged
to ad the meanest oIall parts, that of seducing
with a purpose to betray.. Considering the abi.
lities of the persons with whom he had to deal,
the part was fearcely less difficult, than base;
but he aded it with such address, as to deceive
even the penetrating eye of Morone,., who relpy
ing with full confidence on his sincerity, visited
him at Novara, in order to put the last hand to
their machinations. Pescara received him in
an apartment where Antonio, de Leyva was
placed behind the tapestry, that he might over,
hear and bear witness to their conversation; as
WVIorone was about to take leave, that officer
suddenly appeared, and to his aftoniifhment
arrested him prisoner in the Emperor's name.
He was conducted to the castle of Pavia; and
Pescara, who had so lately been his accomplice,
had now the assurance to interrogate him as: his
judge. At the fame time, the f.mperor de-
clated Sforza to have forfeited all right to the

dutchy of Milan, by his engaging in a con- BOOK IV.

necessity of coming to some agreement with the
French King, unless he would draw on himself
a confederacy of all Europe, which the progress
of his arms, and his ambition, now as undisguised
as it was boundless, filled with general alarm.
He had not hitherto treated Francis with the
generosity which that monarch expedted, and
hardly with the decency due to his station. In-
stead of displaying the sentiments becoming a
great Prince, he seems to have .adied with the
mercenary art of a corsair, who, by the rigorous
usage of his prisoners, endeavours to draw from
them an high price for their ransom. The cap-
tive King was confined in an old castle, under a
keeper whose formal austerity of manners. ren-
dered his vigilance still more difguftful. He was

long without effed. The Emperor, less de-

and that very galling, was added to all th6fe
he had already fuffered. Bourbon arriving ii

long refused to visit the King, received his re,

braced him with the greatest affedion, and pla.
cing him on his left hand, conduded him to
his apartment. These marks of honour to him,
were so many insults to the unfortunate M0Vo
narch; which he felt in a very sensible manner.
It afforded him some consolation, however, to
obferive, that the sentiments of the Spaniards
differed widely from those of their fovrereign.
That generous people detested Bourbon's crime,
Notwithstanding his great talents and impor.
tant services, they shunned all intercourse with
him, to such a degree, that Charles having de.
fired the marquis de Villena to permit Bour.
bon to reside in his palace while the court re.
mained in Toledo, he politely replied, "That
he could not refuse gratifying the Emperor in

CHARLES himself, nevertheless, seemed to Appointed

have it much at heart to reward Bourbon's ser. general of

the Impe-

vices in a signal manner. But as he insisted, in fia armrm
the first place, on the accomplifhmtent of the in Itay.
'Emperor's promise of giving him in marriage
his sifter Eleanora, Queen dowager of Por-
tugal, the honour of which alliance had been
one of his chief inducements to rebel against:
his lawful sovereign; as Francis, in order to
prevent such adangerous union, had offered,
before he left Italy, to marry that Princess.;
and as Eleanora herself discovered an inclination
rather to match with a powerful Monarch, than
with his exiled fubjea; all these interfering
circumstances created great embarrassment to
Charles, and left him hardly, any hope of extri-
cating himself with decency. But the death
of Pescara, who, at the age of thirty-fix, left
behind him the reputation of being one of the
greatest generals and ablest politicians of that,
century, happened opportunely at this jundure
for his relief. By that event, the command of
the army in Italy became vacant, and Charles,
always fertile in ,resources, persuaded Bourbon,

Stious for Franis's liberty was the Emperor's continuing
procuring
rrancis'es to insist so peremptorily on the restitution of Bur-
ie'rty. .gtndy, as a preliminary to that event. Francis

Soften declared -tbat he would never content to

dismember his state; and that even if he
f thould so far forget the duties of a MIVonarch as
to come to such a resolution, the fundamental
laws of the kingdom would prevent its taking
effect. On his part he was willing to make an
absolute cession to the Emperor of all his pre-
tensions in Italy and the Low Countries; he
promised to restore Bourbon all his lands which
had been confiscated; he renewed his proposal
of marrying the Emperor's sifter, -the Queen
dowager of Portugal and engaged to pay a
great funm by way of ransom for his own person.
But all mutual effeem and confidence between
the two .monarchs were now entirely loft; there
appeared on the one hand, a rapacious ambition
labouring to avail itself of every favourable cir.
cumflance; on the other, suspicion and resent-

that the profpedt of bringing their negociations x sa:.
to an issue, seemed to be far distant. The
Dutchess of Alengon, the French King's sifter,

his confinement, employed all her address, in
order to procure his lib'erty on more reasonable

Dauphin, determining rather to end his days in
prison, than to purchase his freedom by con-
ceffions unworthy of a King. The deed for
this purpose he signed with legal formality at
Madrid, empowering his fifler to carry it into
France, that it might be registered in all the
parliaments of the kingdom; and at the fame
time intimating his intention to the Emperor,
he desired him to name the place of his confine-
ment, and to assign him a proper number of
attendants during the remainder of 'his days. "

THIS resolution of the French King had charles

derations, .he was induced to abate -somewhat
of his ,former demands. On the other hand,
Francis's impatience .under Confinement daily
increased; and having received certain intel.

rival in Italy, he grew more compliant with
regard to concessions, trusting, that, if he.could

condition to resume whatever he had yielded.

a126. .As these were the views and sentiments of
Treaty ofthe two Monarchs, the treaty which procured
Madrid. -

Francis his liberty was signed at Madrid on the
fourteenth of January, one thousand five hun-
dred and twenty-fix. The article with regard

to Burgundy, which had hitherto :created the BooKr IV.
greatest difficulty, was comprormifed, Francis i z6.
engaging to restore that dutchy' withall its de-
pendencies in full sovereignty to: the .Emperor;
and Charles confenting' that this restitution should
not be made until the King was set at liberty:
'In. order to feture the performaince 'of this, as
well- as the other conditions in the treaty, Francis
agreed that at the fame instant he' himself was
released, he would deliver as hostages to the
Emperor, his eldest son the Dauphin, his second
son the Duke of Orleans, or in lieu of the latter,
twelve of his principal nobility, to be named by
Charles. The other articles swelled to a great
number, and though not of such importance,
were extremely rigorous. Among these the
rnoft remarkable were, that Francis should re-
nounce all his pretensions in Italy; that he
thould disclaim any title which he had to the
sovereignty of Slanders and Artois'; that within
fix weeks after his release, he should restore to
Bourbon and his adherents, all their goods,
'moveable and immoveable, and make them full
reparation for the damages which they had sus-
tained by the confiscation of them; that he
should use his interest with Henry D' Albert to
relinquish his pretensions to the crown of Na-
varre, and fihould not for the future assist him
in any attempt to recover it; that there fhoutld

a league of perpetual friendship and confe.
deracy, with: a promise of mutual assistance in
every cafe of necefity. That in corroboration
of this union, Francis should marry the Emn
peror's sifter, the Queen Dowager of Portugal;
that Francis -.should cause all the articles of this
treaty to be ratified by the States, and registered
in the parliaments of his kingdom; that upon
the Emperor's:.: receiving this ratification, the
hostages should be Let at liberty; but in their
place, the Duke of Angoulnme, the King's third
son, should be delivered to. Charles, that in
order to manifest, as well as to strengthen the
amity between the two Monarchs, he might be
educated at the Imperial court; and that it
Francis did not, within the time limited, fulfil
the stipulations in the treaty, 'he should promise,
upon his honour and oath, to return into Spain,
and to surrender himself again a: prisoner to the
Emperor ".

Sentiments By this treaty, Charles flattered himself that'
i, ta~r alhe had not only effeAtually humbled his rival,
to it. but that he had taken such precautions as would

for ever prevent his re-attaining any formidable
degree of power. The opinion, which the wisest

" Recueil des Trait. torn, ii, i I2. Ulloa Vita di Carlo

politicians formed concerning it, was very: dif- RBooi TIV.
ferent; they could not persuade themselves that i62.6
Francis, after obtaining his liberty, ..would exe-
cute articles against which he ha:d struggled. fe
long, and to which even amidfl the horrors
of captivity he had consented with such *reluc-
tance. Ambition and resentment, they .knew,
would conspire in promptiag him. to, violate -the
hard conditions -to which he had. been con-
fbrained to. fubmitai nor would arguments anId
casuistry be xanting to represent that which was
so manifestly advantageous, to be necessary and
just. If one .part of Francis's condu¶~ had been
known, at that time, this opinion might have
been founded, not in conjed.ure, but in cer-
tainty. A few hours before he signed the treaty, Francis
he assembled such of his counsellors as were recret1y p'o"
then in 1Vfadrid, and having exaded from them the vaiaity
a solemn oath of secrecy, he made a long enu- ofit.
re-ration in their presence of the dilhonourable
arts, as well as unprincely rigour, which the
Emperor had employed in order to ensnare or
intimidate him. For that reason, he took a
formal protest in the hands of notaries, that his
.consent to ,the treaty thould be considered as an
involuntary deed, and be deemed null and
void ". By this disingenuous artifice, for which

the long-wifhed-for journey towards his own
dominions. He 'was efcorted': by a body of

Cortes both in Castile and Aragon had warmly

dom, granted him an extraordinary dowry with

nts. In some places of Germany, people of the lowea

class \were so entirely in the power of their
masters, as 'to :be fubje&a to personal and do.
reftick slavery, the most rigorous form of that
wretched state. In other provinces, patticularly
in B.ohemia. and Lusatia, the peasants were
bound to: re'main on the lands to which they
belonged,. ahd mniking part of the estate, were
transferred licke any other property from oine
hafnd to another. Even in Suabia, and the
countries on the banks of the Rhine, where their
cd6ndition was most tolerable, the peasants not
only paid the full rent of their 'farms to the
landlord; but if they chose either to change the
place of their abode, or to follow a new pro-
fefion, they were obliged to purchase this pri-
vilege at a 'ceitain price. Besides this, all grants
of lands to 'peafants expired at -their death,
without descending to their pofferity. Upon
that event, the'landlord had ai ight to the befit
of their cattle , as well as of their furniture;
and their heirs, in order to obtain a renewal:'of
the grant, were obliged to pay large sums by
way of fine. These exadions, though grievous,
were born with patience, because they were cuf-
tomary and ancient: But when the progress of
elegance and luxury, as well as the changes in'

troduced into the art of war, came to increase BOOKI IV.
the expence. of government, and made it necef- x52 .
fary, for Princes to levy occasional or stated
taxes on their fubjets, such impositions being
newt, appeared intolerable; and in Germany,
these duties being laid chiefly upon beer, wine,
and other necessaries of life, affeded the com-
mon people in the most sensible manner. The
addition of such a load to their former burdens,
drove them to despair. It was to the valour
inspired by resentment against impositions of

EXTRAVAGANT as there tenets were, they

flattered so many passions in the human heart,
as to make a deep impreflion. To aim at no-
thing more than abridging the power of the
nobility, was now considered as a trifling and
partial reformation, not worth the contending
for ; it was proposed to level every diftindion
among mankind, and by abolishing property, to
reduce them to their natural slate of equality,
in which all should receive their subsistence from
one common stock. Muncer assured them, that
the defign'was approved of by heaven, and that
the Almighty had in a dream ascertained him
of its success. The peasants set about the exe-
cution of it, not only with the rage which ani-
mated those of their order in other parts of Ger-
many, but with the ardour which enthufiafin
inspires. They deposed the magifftrates in alJ the

lands of the nobles, and obliged such of them
as they got into their hands, to put on the dress
commonly Worn by peasants, and instead of their
former titles, to be satisfied with the appellatidh
given to people in the lowest class of life. Vast
numbers engaged in this wild undertaking; but
ViMuncer, their, leader and their prophet, was
destitute of the 0abilities necessary for conduding
it. He had all the extravagance, but not the
courage, which enthusiasts usually *possess. It was
with difficulty he could be persuaded to take the
field; and though he soon drew together eight
thotifand men, he fuffered himself to be fut-
rounded by a body of cavalry under the -com-
inand of the Eledor of Saxony,; the Landgrave
of Hesse, and Dtike of Brunswick. These Princes,
unwilling to shed the blood of their deitided
fubjeds, lent a young nobleman to their camp,
with the offer of a general pardon, if they woiuld
immediately lay down their arms, and deliveir
up the authors of the sedition. Mtuncer, alarmed
at this, began to harangue his followers with

were too impetuous to reniain long inacaive.
They invaded , on very flight pretences, the
province of Prussia, the inhabitants of which
were frill idolaters; and having completed the
conquest of it about the middle of the thirteenth
century, held it many years as a fief depending
on the crown of, Poland., Fierce contests arose
during this p,eriod; between the grand masters
of the order, and the Kings of Poland; the
former struggling for independence , while the
latter asserted their right of sovereignty with
great firmness. Albert, a Prince of the house
of Brandenburgh, who was eleaed grand master

eleven, engaging keenly in this quarrel, main-
tained a long war with Sigismund, King of
Poland; but having become an early convert to-
Luther's doctrines, this gradually leffcned his zeal

the opportunity of the confusions in the Empire,
and the absence of the Emperor, to conclude al
treaty with Sigismund , greatly to his private.

into a"epcular and hereditary dutchy, and the
inveftiture'op it granted to; Albert,. who, in

after this, he made publick profeffion of the
reformed religion, and married a Princess of
Denmark. The Teutonick knights exclaimed
so loudly against the treachery of their grahi
master, that he was put under the "ban of the
Empire ; but he still kept poffeffion of the
province which he had usurped, and transmits-
ted it to his posterity. In process of time this
rich inheritance fell to the eledoral branch of

interests of the French monarchy, that he could
not take any farther step without consulting the

would be necessary in order to reconcile their
iinds to the hard conditions which he had
consented to ratify b. This reply was ;considered

his part, was no less desirous of acquiring such
a considerable acceffllion both of strength and
reputation as such a confederacy would bring
along with it. The chief objects of this alli-
ance, which was concluded at Cognac on the
twenty-fecond of May , though kept secret for
some time, were to. oblige the Emperor to set
at liberty the French King's sons , tipon pay-
ment of a reasonable ransom; and to re-establish
Sforza in the quiet poffeffion of the Mlilanefe.
If Charles ihould refuse either of these , the
contrading parties bound themselves to bring
into the field an army of thirty-five thousand
men, with which, after driving the Spaniards
out of the Milanese , they would attack the
kingdom of Naples. The King of England
was declared ProteA6r of this league, which
they dignified with the name of Holy , because
the Pope was at the head of it; and in order
to allure Henry more effedually, a principality

of all tranfadcions among men , was the natural
consequence of the powers which the Popes
arrogated as the infallible vicegerents of Christ
upon earth. But as, in virtue of this pretended
prerogative , they had often dispensed with
obligations which were held sacred , the interest
of some men, and the credulity of others led
them to imagine that the decisions of a fove.

would, otherwise, have been criminal and im-

TheEmpe- MEANWHILE the discovery of Francis's in-
roralarmed, tention to elude the treaty of Madrid , filled the

Emperor with a variety of disquieting thoughts.
He had treated an unfortunate prince with the
most ungenerous rigour; he had displayed an

insatiable ambition in all his negociations with BQorK IV.

had drawn upon him , 'and what apprehensions
the latter had excited in every court of Europe;
nor h;ad he reaped from the measures which. he
pursued , any of those advantages which :poli-
ticians are apt to confider as an excuse for the
most criminal conduc , and a compensation for
the severest reproaches, Francis was now out
of his hands, and not one of all the mighty
consequences which he had expeded from the
treaty that set him at liberty, was likely to take
place. His rashness in relying so far on his
own juIgment as to trust to the sincerity of the
French King, in opposition to the sentiments of
his w.isest ministers, was now apparent; and he
easily c'onjeAured, that the fame confederacy,
the dread of which had induced him to set
Francis at liberty , would now be formed against
him with that gallant and incensed MVlonarch
at its head. Self-condemnation and shame, on
account of what was past, with anxious appre-
henfions concerning what might happen, were
the necessary result of these refleAions on his
own, condut and situation. Charles, however,
was naturally firm and inflexible in all his mea-
fures. To have receded suddenly from any
article in the treaty of Madrid, would have been
a plain confeffion of imprudence, and a palpable

BooK IV. symptom of fear ; he determined therefore,

Ssz6. that it was most suitable to his dignity , to insist,

.whatever might be the consequences, on the
firiCt execution of the treaty , and particularl
not to accept of any thing which mfght b,
offered as an equivalent for the restitution oil
Burgundy ".

Requires IN consequence of this' resolution , he agp
Francis to pointed Lannoy and Alarcon to repair, as his
perform
what he had ambassadors,, to the court of France, and for.
stipulated. rnally to summon the King either to execute the

treaty with the sincerity that became him, or to,
return , acqording to his oath, a prisoner to
Madrid. Instead of giving them an immediate
answer , Francis admitted the deputies of the
Rates of Burgundy to an audience in their pre.i
fence. They humbly reprefefited to him , that!
he had exceeded the powers vested in a King of
France -when he consented to alienate their
country from the crown, the domains of which
he was bound by his coronation oath to preserve
entire and unimpaired. Francis , in return,
thanked them for their attachment to his crown~,
and intreated them , though very faintly , to
remember the obligations which he -lay under
to fulfil his engagements with the Emperor.
The deputies assuming an higher tone, declared

Guic. 1. xvii. 366.

that they would not obey commands which they BOOK IV.
considered as illegal ; and if he thould aban'don r~6.
them to the enemies of France, they had re-

were his chief objets; and for the fake of these,
he would willingly have sacrificed Sforza and

taking advaritage of their efforts, in order to Boot~ iV,
enforce the proposals which he often renewed J126.
at the court of Madrid for obtaining the liberty
of his sons. The Pope and Venetians expoftu-
lated and complained '; but as they were not
able to rouse Francis from his inadtivity, their
own zeal and vigour gradually abated, and
Clement, having already gone farther than his
timidity usually permitted him, began to accuse
himself of rashness, and to .relapse into his nai-
tural state of doubt and uncertainty,

ALL the Emperor's motions depending on0 eaures of

himself alone, were more brisk and better con-the Jmpe-
certed. The narrowness of his revenues, in- ria'iQs
deed, did not allow him to make any sudden or
great effort in the field, but he abundantly sup-
plied that defed by his intrigues and negocia-
tions. The family of Colonna, the most power-
ful of all the Roman barons, had adhered uni,
formly to the Ghibeline or Imperial fadion, dur-
ing those fierce contentions between the Popes
and Emperors, which, for several ages, filled
Italy and Germany with discord and bloodshed.
Though the causes which at first gave birth to
these deftrudive fadions existed no longer, and

a'nd by placinig: themselves under the protedion
of the Emper.ors., secured the quiet poffeffion of
their own territories and privileges. The Car-
dinal Pompeo Colonna, a man of a turbulent
and ambitious temper, at that time the head of
the family, had long been Clement's rival, to
whose influence in the last conclave he imputed
the disappointment .of all his schemes for at.
taining the papal dignity, of which, from his
known connection with the Emperor, hethought
himself secure. This was too great an injury
to an aspiring mind ever to be forgiven; and
though he had dissembled his resentment so far
as to vote for Clement at his. elecion, and to ac-
cept of great offices in his court, he waited with
th'e utmost impatience for an opportunity of
being revenged. Don Hugo di IVioncada, the
Imperial ambassador at Rome, who was no
stranger to. these sentiments, easily persuaded
him, that now was the time, while all the papal
troops were employed in Lombardy , to attempt
something which would at once avenge his own
wrongs , and be of eflential service to the Em-
peror his patron. The Pope, however, whose
timidity rendered him quick-fighted, was so at-
tentive to their operations, and began to be
alarmed to early , that he might have drawn to:

castle of St. Angelo, which was- immediately in-
vested. The palace of the Vitican, the church
of St. Peter, and the houses of the Pope's mini-
fters and servants, were plundered in the most
licentious manner; the reft of the city was left
unmolested. Clement, destitute of every thing

,patient at that juncture to escape from the op-
pression of their superiors in religious as well as
civil matters, crowded to hi.s standard; so that
without any other gratuity than the payment
of a crown to each man, fourteen thousand
enlisted in his service. To these the Archduke
Ferdinand added two thousand horse, levied in
the Austrian dominions. But although the
Emperor, had raised troops, he could not remit
the sums necessary for their support. His or-
dinary revenues were exhausted; the credit of
princes, during the infancy of commerce, was
not extensive; and the Cortes of Castile, though
every art had been tried to gain them, and some
innovations had been made in the constitution-,
in 'order to secure their concurrence, peremp-
torily refused to grant Charles any extraordi-
nary supply "5; so that the more his army in-
creased in number, the more were his generals
embarrassed and diftrefted. Bourbon, in par-
ticular, was involved in such difficulties, that
he stood in need of all his address and courage
in order to extricate himself. Vast fumns were
due to the Spanish troops already in the *Mnila-
nefe, when Frondfperg arrived with sixteen thou-
sand hungry Germans, destitute of every thing.

StlMo.roine Bourbon granted his life and liberty to Morone,

who having been kept in prison since his in-
trigue with Pescara, had been condemned to die
by the Spanish judges empowered to try him.
For this remission he paid twenty thousand
ducats; and' such were his singular talents, and
the ;vonderful ascendant which he always acquired
over the minds of those to whom he had access,
that in a few days, from being Bourbon's pri-
foner, he became his prime confident, with whom

insinuations must .be imputed the suspicions which
Bourbon began to entertain, that the Emperor
had never intended to grant him the investiture
of IMilan, but had appointed Leyva, and the
other Spanish generals , rather to be fIiies on his
conduct, than to co-operate heartily towards the
execution of his schemes. To him likewise, as
he still -retained at the age of fourscore all the

increased daily; the Emperor made ho remittan-
ces to his generals ; and the utrnmoft rigour of
military extortion could draw nothing more from
a country entirely drained and ruined. In this
situation there was no choice left, but either to
disband the army, or to march for fubfiftance
into the enemy's country. The territories of the
Venetians lay nearest at hand; but they, with
their usual foresight and prudence, had taken
fach precautions as secured them from any
insult. Nothing , therefore , remained but to

ritories. ing them under such disadvantages, as furnish the

firongeft proof both of the despair to which he
was reduced, and of the greatness of his abilities
which were able to surmount so many obstacles.
Having committed the government of MJVIan to
Leyva, whom he was not unwilling to leave

January 30o. behind , he began his march in the depth of

winter, at the head of twenty-five thousand men,

" Jovii. Vita Pomp. Colon. Guic. 1. xviii. 424.

composed of nations differing from each other Booi IV,
in language and manners ; without money, xs27.
without magazines, without artillery, without
carriages; in short, without any of those things
which are necessary to the smallest party, and
which seem essential to the existence and mo-
tions of a great army. His route lay through
a country cut by rivers and mountains, in which
the roads were almost impraticable; as an addi-
tion to his difficulties, the enemy's army, superior
to his own in number, was at hand to watch
all his motions, and to improve every advantage.
But his, troops, impatient of their present hard-
Ihips, and allured by the hopes of immense
booty, without considering how ill- provided
they were for a march , followed him with
great chearfulnefs, His firlt scheme was to have
made himself master of Placen'tia, and to have
gratified his soldiers with the plunder of that
city-; but the vigilance of the confederate gener-
als rendered the design abortive ; nor had he
better success in his project for the reduction of
Bologna, which was seasonably supplied with
as many troops as secured it from the insults
of an army which had neither artillery nor
ammunition. Having failed in both these at-
tempts to become master of some great city,
he was under a necessity of advancing. But
he had now been two months in the field ; his

Boort IV. troops had fuffered every calamity that a long

is2r7. march, together with the uncommon rigour of

the feafori , could bring upon men destitute
of all necessary accommodations in an enemyis
country ; the magnificent promises to which
they trusted, had proved altogether vain; they
saw no profped of relief; their patience, tried
to the utmost , failed at last, and they broke

Mntiny ofout into open mutiny. Some officers, who raftly
his troops.-attempted to restrain them, fell vidims to their

fury ; Bourbon himself, not daring to appear
during the hrft transports of their rage, yas
obliged to fly fecrctly from his quarters ',
But this sudden ebullition of wrath began at
last to subside; when Bourbon, who poffeffed
in a wonderful degree the arc of governing
the minds of soldiers, renewed his promises
with more confidence than formerly, and assured
them that they would be soon accomplished.
He endeavoured to render their hardship more
tolerable , by partaking of them himself; he
fared no better than the meanest ceritinel; he
marched along with them on foot; he joined
them in singing their camp-ballads, in which,
with high praises of his valour, they mingled
many firokes of military raillery on his poverty;
and wherever they came, he allowed them, as a
' foretaste of what he had promised, to plunder

by all these soothing arts, they entirely forgot iS Z7.
their fufferings and complaints, and followed

BOURBON, meanwhile , carefully concealed The Pope's

irresolution

his intentions. Rome and Florence, not know-a rimeoru-
ing on xibich the blow would fall, were held deuce.
in the most disquieting slate of suspense. Clement,
equally solicitous for the safety of both , fluc-
tuated in more than his usual uncertainty; and
while the rapid approach of danger called for
prompt and decisive measures , he spent the
time in deliberations which 'came to no issue,
or in taking resolutions , which , next day, his
restless mind, more sagacious in discerning than
in obviating difficulties, overturned, without
being able to fix on what should be substituted
in their place. At one time he determined to
unite himself more closely than ever with his
allies, and to push on the war with vigour; at
another, he inclined to bring all differences to
a final accommodation by a treaty with Lannoy,
who knowing his passion for negociation, soli-
cited him incessantly with proposals for that
purpose. His timidity at length prevailed, and

' Oeuvres de Brant. vol. iv. p. 246, &e.

BooIt IV. led him to conclude an agreement with Lannoyi

I27. of which the following were the chief articles,
lMarch i,a That a suspension of arms should take place

treaty with between the Pontifical and Imperia! troops
the viceroy for eight months; That Clement ihould advance
of Naples, sixty thousand crowns towards satisfying the

demands of the Imperial army; That the Co.
lonnas should be absolved from censure , and
their former dignities and poffeflions hle restored
to them; That the viceroy should come to
Rome, and prevent Bourbon from approaching
nearer to that city, or to Florence ". On this
hasty treaty, which deprived him of all hopes
of assistance .from his allies, without affording
him any solid foundation of security, Clement
relied fo' firmly, that, like a man extricated at
once out of all difficulties, he was at perfect
ease, and in the fulness of his confidence dif-
banded all his troops, except as many as were
fufficient to guard his own person, This ama,
zing confidence of Clement's, who on .every
other occasion was fearful and suspicious to
excess, appeared to unaccountable to Guicciar-
dini, who being at that time the pontifical corn,
miffary- general and resident in the confederate
army, had great opportunities as well as great
abilities for observing how chimerical all his
hopes were, that he imputes the Pope's condud,

LANNOY, it would seem, intended to have which

Bourbon

executed the treaty with great sincerity ; and disregards.
having detached Clement from the confederacy,
wished to turn Bourbon's arms against the Vene-
tians, who, of all the powers at war with the
Emperor, had exerted the greatest vigour. With
this view he dispatched a courier to Bourbon,
informing him of the suspension of arms, which,
in the name of their common master, he had
concluded with the Pope. Bourbon had other
schemes ; and he had prosecuted them now
too far to think of retreating. To have men-
tioned a retreat to his soldiers , would have
been dangerous; his command was independent
on Lannoy: he was fond of mortifying a man
whom he had many reasons to hate: for these
reasons, without paying the least regard to the
message, he continued to ravage the ecclesiastical
territories , and to advance towards Florence.
Upon this , all Clement's terror and anxiety
returning with new force, he had recourse to
Lannoy, and intreated and conjured him to put
a stop to Bourbon's progress. Lannoy accord-
ingly set out for his camp , but durst not ap-
proach it; Bourbon's soldiers having got notice

"' Guic. 1. xviii. 446.

BooKr IV. of the truce, raged and threatened, demanding

is27. the accomplishment of the promises to which

they had trusted ; their general himself could
hardly restrain them; every person in Rome
perceived that nothing remained but to prepare
for resisting a storm which it was now impoffille
to dispel. Clement alone, relying on some ambi.
guous and deceitful profeffions which Bourbon
made of his inclination towards peace, funk back
into his former security '".

Advances BOURBON, on his part, was far from being
towards free from solicitude. All his attempts on any
Rome. place of importance had hitherto miscarried;

and Florence, towards which he had been ap.
proaching for some time , was, by the arrival
of the Duke d'Urbino's army, put in a condition
to set his power at defiance. As it now became
necessary to change his route, and to take in.
ltantly some new resolution, he fixed without
hesitation on one no less daring in itself, than
it was impious, according to the opinion of that
age. 'This was 'to' assault and plunder Rome.
IVIany reasons, however, prompted him to it
He was fond of .thwarting Lannoy, who had
undertaken for the safety of that city; he ima-
gined that the Emperor would be highly pleased
to fee Clement, the chief author of the league

against him, humbled; he flattered himself,
that by gratifying the rapacity of his toldiers
with such immense booty , he would attach
them for ever to his interest; or (which is still
more probable than any of these) he hoped that
by means of the poweri and fame, which he
would acquire, from the conquest of the first
city in Christendom , he might lay the
foundation of an independent power; and that
after shaking off all connedion with the Em-
peror, he might take poffeflion of Naples, or
of some of the Italian fRates in his own name 6. Booic IV.

WHATEVER his motives were, he executed The pope's

his resolution with a rapidity equal to the bold- preparations

plained neither of fatigue , not famine, nor
want of pay. No sooner did they begin to
move from Tuscany towards Rome, than the
Pope, sensible at last how fallacious the hopes

had been on which he reposed, started from his

security. But no time now remained, even for
a bold and decisive- Pontiff, to have taken
proper measures, or to have formed any effec-
tual plan of defence. Under Clement's feeble
condu&, all was consternation; disorder, and
irresolution. He colleded, however, such of
his difbarided soldiers as still remained in the

22z7. footmen and train- bearers of the Cardinals;

'he repaired. the breaches in the walls; he began
to ered new works; he excommunicated Bour.
bon and all his troops, branding the Germans
with the name of Lutherans, and the Spaniards
with that of Moors 66. Trusting to these inef.
fedual military preparations, or to his spiritual
arms, which were still more despised by rapa.
cious soldiers, he seems to have laid aside his
natural timidity, and contrary to the advice of
all his counsellors, determined to wait the ap.

EARLY in the morning, Bourbon, who had

determined to diflinguifh that day' either by his
death or. the success of his enterprize, appeared
at the head of his troops, clad in complete
armour, above which he wore a vest of white
tifTue, that he might be more conspicuous both
to his friends and .to his enemies; and as all
depended on one bold impression, he led them
inflantly to scale the walls. Three diftinci bo-
dies, one of Germans, another of Spaniards,
and the last of Italians, the three different
nations of whom the army was composed, were
appointed to this service; a separate attack was
afiigned to each; and the whole army advanced
to support them as occasion should require. A
thick mist concealed their approach until they
reached almofl the brink of the ditch which
surrounded the suburbs: having planted their
ladders in a moment, each brigade rushed on
i to the assault with an impetuosity heightened

by national emulation. They were received at
first with fortitude equal to their own; the
Swiss in the Pope's guards, and the veteran fol-
diers who had been afferbled, fought with a
courage becoming men to whom the defence
of the noblest city in the world, was entrusted.
Bourbon's troops , notw.ithRfanding all their
valour, gained no ground, and even began to

on this critical moment the fate of the day de.
pended, threw himself from his horse, pressed
to the front, snatched a scaling ladder from a
soldier, planted it against the wall, and began
to mount it, encouraging his men with his voice
anid hand, to follow him. But at that very
instant, a musket bullet from the ramparts
pierced his groin with a wound, which he im,
mediately felt to be mortal; but he retained so
much presence of mind as to desire ;those who
were near him to cover his body with a cloak,
that his death might not dishearten his troops;
and Loon after he expired with a courage worthy
of a better cause, ahd which would have enti:
tied him to the highest praise, if he had thus
fallen in defence of his country, not at the head
of its enemies. "7

THIs fatal event could not be concealed from

the army; the soldiers soon miffed their gene-
ral, whom they were accustomed to fee in every
time of danger; but instead of being difheart-
ened by their loss, it animated them with new
valour; the name of Bourbon refounded along
the line, accompanied with the cry of blood
and revenge. The veterans who defended the
walls, were -soon overpowered by numbers;
the untrained body of city-recruits fled at the

DURING the combat, Clement was employed

at the altar of St. Peter's in offering tfp to <
Heaven unavailing prayers for vidory. No
sooner was he informed that his troops began to
give way, than he fled with precipitation; andc
with an infatuation still more amazing than any
thing already mentioned, instead of making his
escape by the opposite gate where there was no,
enemy to oppose it, he slut himself up, together
with thirteen cardinals, the foreign ambassadors,
and many 'perfons oF diftindion, in the castle of
St. Angelo, which, from his late misfortune, rhe
might have' known to be an insecure retreat.
In his way from the Vatican to that fortress ,
he saw his troops flying before an enemy who
pursued without giving quarter; he heard the
cries and lamentations of the Roman citizens,
and beheld the beginning of those calamities

15 27. these the wretched inhabitant's were obliged to

fuffer. Churches, palaces, and the houses of
private persons .,ere plundered without dif.
tindion. No age, or charaeder, or sex was
exempt from injury. Cardinals, nobles, priests;
n matrons, virgins, were all the prey of soldiers,
and at the mercy of men deaf to the voice of
humanity. Nor did there outrages cease, as is
usual in towns which are carried by assault,
when the first fury of the storm was over; the
Imperialists kept poffeffion of Rome several
months; and during all that time the insolence
and brutality of the soldiers hardly abated.
Their booty in ready money alone amounted to
a million of ducatts; what they raised by ran-
fobms and exadions far exceeded that fum.
Rome, though taken several different times by
the northern nations, who over-ran the 'Empire
in the fifth and sixth centuries, was never
treated with so much cruelty by the barbarous

Chalons prince of Orange, who with difficulty BooK IV.
prevailed on as many of his soldiers to desist iz27.
from the pillage as were necessary to invest the
castle of St. Angelo. Clement was immediately
sensible of his error in having retired into that
ill-provided and untenable fort. But- as the
Imperialists, scorning discipline, and intent only
on plunder, pushed the siege with little vigour,
he did not despair of holding out, until the Duke
d'Urbino should come to his relief. That ge-
neral advanced at the head of an army com-
posed of Venetians, Florentines, and Swiss in

have delivered Clement from the. present danger.
But d'Urbino, preferring the indulgence of his

of delivering, the capital of Christendom, and
the head of the church, pronounced the enter-

horror at the success and crimes of their coun-

THE good fortune of the house of AuftriaSolyman in-

. vades Hun-

was no less conspicuous in another part of Eu-gadesr
rope. Solyman having invaded Hungary- with
an army three hundred thousand strong, Lewis
II.'King of that country, and of Bohemia, a
weak and unexperienced prince, advanced rashly
to meet him with a body of men which did not
amount to thirty thousand. With an impru-
dence still more unpardonable, he gave the
command of these troops to Paul Tomorri, a
Franciscan monk, archbilhop of Goloczp This
aukward general, in the dress of his order, girt
with its cord, marched at the head of the
troops; and hurried on by his own prefump-
tion, as well as by the impetuosity of nobles
who despised danger, but were impatient of
long service, he fought the fatal battle of Mo- Aui. "9.

founded on a. double title; the one derived
from- the an'cient pretensions of the house of
Auffria to both. kingdoms; the other from the
right of his wife, the only sifter of the deceased
Monarch. The feudal institutions however sub.
sifted both in Hungary and Bohemia in such
vigour, and the nobles poffeffed such extensive
power; that the crowns were still ele'clive, and
Ferdinand's rights , if they had not been power-
fully supported , would have met with little
regard. But his own perional merit; the re-
spect de to the brother of the greatest Monarch
in C1riftendom ; the necessity of ,chufing a
prince able to afford his fubjeds some additional

and protedtion against the Turkish arms, which', as

they had recently felt their power, they [greatly
dreaded ; together with the intrigues of his
sifter,, who had been married to the late King,
overcame the prejudices which the Hungarians
had conceived againff the Archduke as a so.

for the Vaywode of Tranfilvania, at length
secured Ferdinand the throne of that kingdom,

THE dissensions between the Pope and Em-Progres of

the Refor-

peror proved extremely favourable to the pro- mation.
grefs of Lutheranifm. Charles, exasperated by
Clement's condut,. and .fully employed in op-
posing the league which he* had formed against
them, had little inclination arid less leisure to
take any measures for suppressing the new opi-
nions in Germany. In a diet of the Empire June

-

held at Spires, the state of religion came to be ''56-
considered, and all that the Emperor required
of the princes was, that they would wait pva-
tiently, and without encouraging innovations,
for the meeting of a general council which he
had demanded of the Pope. They, in return,
acknowledged the convocation of a council to
be the proper and regular step towards reform-
ing abuses in the church; but contended, that
a national council held in Germany would be
more effeaual for that purpose than what he
had proposed. To his advice, concerning the
discouragement of innovations, they paid so

niftered the sacraments according to the rites

example emboldened the Germans to treat the
papal authority with little- reverence. During
" the heat of his resentment against Clement, he

had publilhed a long reply to an .angry brieve
which'the Pope had, intended as ari apology for
his own condut. In this manifetbo,, the Em.
peror, after, having enumerated many instances
of that.Podntiff's ingratitudg, deceit-, and ambi.
