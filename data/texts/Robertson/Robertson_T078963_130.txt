# PREFACE.

P R E F A C E.

N fulfilling the engagement which I had come under
to the Public with refpct to the Hifory of America,

it was my intention not to have publiflied any part of
the work until the whole was completed. The present
slate of the British Colonies has induced me to alter

that resolution. While they are engaged in civil
war with Great Britain, inquiries and speculations
concerning their ancient forms of policy and laws,
which cxift no longer, cannot be interefling. The at-
tention and expectation of mankind arc now turned
towards their future condition. In whatever manner this

unhappy contefft may terminate, a new order of things
muff arise in North America, and its affairs will aflume
another afpest. I wait, with the solicitude of a good
citizen, until the ferment subside, and regular govern-
mcnt be rc-cflabliflcd, and then I fiall return to this
part of my work, in which I had made some pro-
grcfs. That, together with the hiflory of Portuguese

America,

America, and of the fcttlements made by the several
nations of Europe in the Weft India islands, will com-
plete my plan.

THE two volumes which I now publish, contain an
account of the discovery of the New World, and of the
progrcfs of the Spanifl arms and colonies there. This
is not only the most splendid portion of the American
ilory, but so much detached, as, by itself, to form a
perfec't whole, remarkable for the unity of the fubjecr.
As the principles and maxims of the Spaniards in
planting colonies, which have been adopted in some
measure by every nation, are unfolded in this part of
my work; it will serve as a proper introducction to the
history of all the European eflablifhments in America,
and convey such information concerning this important
article of policy, as may be deemed no less interesting
than curious.

IN describing the atchicvernents and inflitutions of the

Spaniards in the New World, I have departed in many
instances fron the accounts of preceding hifiorians,
and have often related facts which seem to have been

unknown to them. It is a duty I owe the Public, to

meition the fourccs from which I have derived such
intelligence, as justifies me cither in placing transactions

6 in

in a new light, or in forming any new opinion with
refpet to their causes and effeEts. This duty I perform
with greater satisfaction, as it will afford an opportu-
nity of expressing my gratitude to those benefactors,
who have honoured me with their countenance and aid
in my researches.

As it was from Spain that I had to expect the most

important information, with regard to this part of my
work, I confidered it as a very fortunate circumfiance
for me, when Lord Grantham, to whom I had the
honour of being personally known, and with whose
liberality of sentiment, and disposition to oblige, I was
well acquainted, was appointed ambassador to the
court of Madrid. Upon applying to him, I met with
such a reception as satisfied me, that his endeavours
would be employed in the mofl proper manner, in
order to obtain the gratification of my wifles; and I
am perfectly sensible, that what progrcfs I have made
in my inquiries among the Spaniards, ought to be
ascribed chiefly to their knowing how much his Lord-
ship interefled himfclf in my Ifcccfs.

BUT did I owe nothing more to Lord Grantham, than

the advantages which I have derived from his attcn-
tion in engaging Mr. Waddilovc, the chaplain of his

enibafil,

erbalfy, to take the conduct of my literary inquiries in
Spain, the obligations I lie under to him would be very
great. During five years, that gentleman has carried
on researches for my behoof, with such activity, perse-
verance, and knowledge of the fubje, to which his
attention was turned, as have filled me with no less aflo-
nifiment than fatisfa6cion. He procured for me the
greater part of the Spanish books, which I have consult-
ed; and as many of them were printed early in the fix-
teenth century, and are become extremely rare, the
coilecting of thele was such an occupation, as, alone,
required much time and afliduity. To his friendly at-
tention I am indebted for copies of several valuable ma-
nufcripts, containing facts and details which I might
have searched for in vain, in works that have been made
public. Encouraged by the inviting good-will with
which Mr. Waddilove conferred his favours, I transmit-
ted to him a set of queries, with refpe: both to the cuf-
toms and policy of the native Americans, and the nature
of several institutions in the Spanifi settlements, framed
in such a manner, that a Spaniard might answer them,
without disclosing any thing that was improper to be
communicated to a foreigner. He translated these into
Spanifl, and obtained from various persons who had
resided in most of the Spanish colonies, such replies as
have afforded me much infiruction.

9 NOTWITH-

NOTWITHSTANDING those peculiar advantages with

which my inquiries were carried on in Spain, it is with
regret I am obliged to add, that their success mufl be
ascribed to the beneficence of individuals, not t any
communication by public authority. By a singular ar-
rangement of Philip II. the records of the Spanifl mo-
narchy, are deposited in the Archivo of Simancas, near
Valladolid, at the difance of a hundred and twenty
miles from the feat of government, and the supreme
courts of justice. The papers relative to America, and
chiefly to that early period of its history, towards which
my attention was directed, arc so numerous, that they
alone, according to one account, fill the largcft apart-
ment in the Archivo; and according to another, they
compose eight hundred and feventy-three large bundles.
Conscious of possessing, in some degree, the industry
which belongs to an historian, the profpet of fclh a
treasure excited my most ardent curiofiry. But the
profpec of it, is all that I have enjoyed. Spain, with an
excess of caution, has uniformly thrown a veil over her
tranfations in America. From firangers they are con-
cealed with peculiar folicitudc. Even to her ovn sub-
je(ts the Archivo of Simancas is not opened without a
particular order from the crown; and after obtaning
that, papers cannot be copied, without paying fees of

VOL. I. a oflice

office so exorbitant, that the expence exceeds what it
would be proper to bellow, when the gratification of
literary curiosity is the only object. It is to be hoped,
that the Spaniards will at last discover this fyflem of
concealment to be no less impolitic than illiberal. From
what I have experienced in the course of my inquiries,
I am satisfied, that upon a more minute scrutiny into
their early operations in the New World, however re-
prehenfible the ations of individuals may appear, the
conduct of the nation will be placed in a more favour-
able light.

IN other parts of Europe very different sentiments pre-

vail. Having searched, without success, in Spain, for a
letter of Cortes to Charles V. written soon after he landed
in the Mexican empire, which has not hitherto been pu-
blifhed; it occurred to me, that as the emperor was set-
ting out for Germany, at the time when the messengers
from Cortes arrived in Europe, the letter with which they
were intrusted might possibly be preserved in the Imperial
Library of Vienna. I communicated this idea toSir Robert
Murray Keith, with whom I have long had the honour to
live in friendflip, and I had soon the pleasure to learn,
that, upon his application, her Imperial Majefly had
been graciously pleated to iflue an order, that not only
a copy of that letter (if it were found), but of any other

3 papers

papers in the library, which could throw light upon the
History of America, hould be transmitted to me. The
letter from Cortes is not in the Imperial Library, but an
authentic copy, attested by a notary, of that written by.
the magistrates of the colony planted by him at Vera
Cruz, which I have mentioned, Vol. ii. p. 32, having
been found; it was transcribed, and sent to me. This,
no less curious, and as little known as the letter which
was the object of my inquiries, I did not receive un-
til that part of the hifRory to which it relates was
printed; but I have given some account of what is most
worthy of notice in it, at the end of Notes and Illuftra-
tions, vol. ii. Together with it, I received a copy of a
letter from Cortes, containing a long account of his ex-
pedition to Honduras, with repet to which, I did not
think it necessary to enter into any particular detail;
and likewise those curious Mexican paintings, which I
have described, vol. ii. p. 284, &c.

MY inquiries at St. PeterfDurgh were carried on with

equal facility and success. In examining into the
nearest communication between our continent and that
of America, it became of consequence to obtain authen-
tic information concerning the discoveries of the Ruffians,
in their navigation from Kamchatka towards the coast

a 2 of

of America. Accurate relations of their firfi voyage, in
1741, have been published by Muller and Gmelin. Se-
veral foreign authors have entertained an opinion, that
the court of Russia fludioufly conceals the progress
which has been made by more recent navigators, and
suffers the Public to be amused with false accounts of

their route. Such conduct appeared to me unsuitable
to those liberal sentiments, and that patronage of science,
for which the present overeign of Russia is eminent;
nor could I discern any political reason, that might
render it improper to apply for information concern-
ing the late attempts of the Ruffians to open a com-
munication between Asia and America. My inge-
nious countryman, Dr. Rogerfon, firfl physician to
the Empress, presented my request to her Imperial
Majesty, who not only disclaimed any idea of conceal-
ment, but intfantly ordered the journal of Captain
Krenitzin, who conduted the only voyage of discovery
made by public authority since the year 1741, to be
translated, and his original chart to be copied for my
use. By consulting them, I have been enabled to give a
more accurate view of the progress and extent of the
Ruflian discoverics, than has hitherto been communi-
cated to the Public.

FROM

FROM other quarters I have received information of

great utility and importance. M. le Chevalier de Pinto,
the minister from Portugal to the court of Great Britain,
who commanded for several years atMatagroffo, a fettle-
ment of the Portuguese in the interior part of Brasil,
where the Indians are numerous, and their original
manners little altered by intercourse with Europeans,
was pleased to fend me very full answers to some queries
concerning the character and institutions of the natives
of America, which his polite reception of an application
made to him in my name, encouraged me to propose.
These satisfied me, that he had contemplated with a dif-
cerning attention the curious objects which his situation
presented to his view, and I have often followed him as
one of my heft inftruded guides.

M. SUARD, to whose elegant translation of the History

of the reign of Charles V. I owe the favourable recep-
tion of that work on the continent, procured me an-
fwers to the fame queries from M. de Bougainville,
who had opportunities of obfcrving the Indians both of
North and South America, and from M. Godin le Jeune,
who resided fifteen years among Indians in Quito, and
twenty years in Cayenne. The latter arc more valuable
from having been xamined by M. dela Condamine,

who,

who, a few weeks before his death, made ome ihort
additions to them, which may be confidered as the last
effort of that attention to science which occupied a
long life.

MY inquiries were not confined to one region in Ame-

rica. Governor Hutchinson took the trouble of recom-
mending the consideration of my queries to Mr. Hawley
and Mr. Brainerd, two protestant miflionaries, employ-
ed among the Indians of the Five Nations, who fa-
voured me with answers, which discover a considerable
knowledge of the people whose customs they describe.
From William Smith, Efq; the ingenious hiflorian of
New York, I received some useful information. When I
enter upon the History of our Colonies in North Ame-
rica, I fiall have occasion to acknowledge how much I
have been indebted to many other gentlemen of that
country.

FROM the valuable Collection of Voyages made by

Alexander Dalrymple, Efq; with whose attention to the
History of Navigation and Discovery the Public is well
acquainted, I have received ome very rare books, par-
ticularly two large volumes of Memorials, partly ma-
nufcript, and partly in print, which were presented to

the

the court of Spain during the reigns of Philip III. and
Philip IV. From there I have learned many curious par-
ticulars with respeCt to the interior state of the Spanish
colonies, and the various schemes formed for their im-
provement. As this Collection of Memorials formerly
belonged to the Colbert Library, I have quoted them by
that title.

ALL those books and manuscripts I have consulted

with that attention, which the refpet due from an Au-
thor to the Public required; and by minute references to
them, I have endeavoured to authenticate whatever I re-
late. The longer I refle&t on the nature of historical com-
position, the more I am convinced that this scrupulous ac-
curacy is neceflary. The historian who records the events
of his own time, is credited in proportion to the opinion
which the Public entertains with refpet to his means
of information and his veracity. He who delineates the
tranfadtions of a remote period, has no title to claim
aflent, unless he produces evidence in proof of his asser-
tions. Without this, he may write an amusing tale, but
cannot be said to have compoed an authentic hiltory.
In those sentiments I have been confirmed by the opinion
of an author , whom his industry, erudition, and dif-

* Mr. Gibbon.

cern-

cernment, have deservedly placed in a high rank among
the mofl eminent historians of the age. Emboldened
by a hint from him, I have publifihed a catalogue of
the Spanish books which I have consulted, This prac-
tice was frequent in the lafl century, and confidered as an
evidence of laudable industry in an author; in the pre-
sent, it may, perhaps, be deemed the effe& of oitenta-
tion; but as many of these books are unknown in Great
Britain, I could not otherwise have referred to them as
authorities, without encumbering the page with an in-
fertion of their full titles. To any person who may
chufe to follow me in this path of inquiry, the cata-
logue must be very useful.

MY readers will observe, that in mentioning fums

of money, I have uniformly followed the Spanifl
method of computing by peos. In America, the peso
fiterte, or duro, is the only one known, and that is
always meant when any fum imported from America
is mentioned. The peso fuerte, as well as other
coins, has varied in its numerary value, but I have
been advised, without attending to such minute va-
riations, to confider it as equal to four flillings and
fix pence of our money. It is to be remembered,
however, that in the sixteenth century, the effec-

9 tive,

tive value of a peso, i. e. the quantity of la-
bour which it represented, or of goods which it
would purchase, was five or fix times as much as
at present.

Several ages elapsed before they removed far from those The earth

mild and fertile regions where they were originally placed by pled.
their'Creator. The occasion of their first general dispersion is
known; but we are unacquainted with the course of their mi-
grations, or the time when they took possession of the different
countries which they now inhabit. Neither history nor tradi-
tion furnish such information concerning those remote events,
as enables us to trace, with any certainty, the operations of the
human race in the infancy of society.

WE may conclude, however, that all the early migrations Si;rs mia-

'.------ tries, seem, at firit, to be formed to check the progress of man,

and to'mark the bounds of that portion of the globe to which
nature had confined him. It was long, we may believe, before
men attempted to pals this formidable barrier, and became so
fliilful and adventrous as to commit themselves to the mercy of
the winds and waves, or to quit their native shore in quest of
remote and unknown regions.

First attemrts NAVIGATION and hip-building are arts so nice and compli-
gati navi- cated, that they require the ingenuity, as well as experience of

many successive ages to bring them to any degree of perfection.
From the raft or canoe, which first served to cairy a savage
over the river that obftruted him in the chace, to the conftruc-
tion of a vessel capable of conveying a numerous crew with
safety to a diflant coast, the progress in improvement is immense.
Many efforts would be made, many experiments would be
tried, and much labour as well as invention would be employed,
before men could accomplish this arduous and important un-
dertaking. The rude and imperfect slate in which navigation
is still found among all nations which are not considerably ci-
vilized, corresponds with this account of its progress, and de-
monfl'rates that, in early times, the art was not so far improved
as to enable men to undertake diflant voyages, or to attempt
remote difcovcries.

Iitrotlulion As son, however, as the art of navigation became known,
(.i coIcll c. .

a n ewv species of correfpondcnce among men took place. It is
from this txra, that we mull date the commencement of fich an
iiitcrcourfe between nations as dcfervcs the appellation of com-
merce. Men are, indeed, far advanced in improvcmcnt before

I commerce

commerce becomes an obje&- of gr.at importance to them. B 0o K
They must even have made rome considerable progress towards
civilization, before they acquire the idea of property, and afcer-
tain it so perfedly, as to be acquainted with the most finple of
all contracs, that of exchanging by barter one rude commodity
for another. But as soon as this important right is eflablifhed,
and every individual feels that he has an exclulive title to pof-
fess or to alienate whatever he has acquired by his own labour
and dexterity, the wants and ingenuity of his nature suggest
to him a new method of incrcafing his acquisitions and enjoy-
ments, by disposing of what is superfluous in his own stores, in
order to procure what is neceFary or desirable in tlhoc of other
men. Thus a commercial intercourse begins, and is carried
on among the members of the fame community. By degrees,
they discover that neighbouring tribes poflcfs what they them-
selves want, and enjoy comforts of which they wifl to partake.
In the fame mode, and upon the fame principles, that domestic
traffic is carried on within the society, an external commerce is
eltablifhed with other tribes or nations. Their mutual interest
and mutual wants render this intercourse desirable, and imper-
ceptibly introduce the maxims and laws which facilitate its pro-
grefs and render it fccure. But no very extensive commerce can
take place between contiguous provinces, whose Ibil and climate
being nearly the fame, yield t(i ilar produ(Cions. Remote
countries cannot convey tlicir commodities by land, to tliofc
places, where on account of their rarity they are delircd, and
become valuable. It is to navigation that men are indebted for
the power of tranfliorting the fiIbpcrflIouIs flock of one part of the
earth, to supply tle vwants of another. The luxuries and Iblcl'-
ings of a particular cliimate are no longer confined to itlc'lf
alone, but tle enjoymnt of them is communicated to the most
diflant regions.

B o IN

B o K. IN proportion as the knowledge of the advantages derivcd?
---.' from navigation and commerce continued to spread, the inter-

course among nations extended. The ambition of conquest, or
the necessity of procuring a new settlement, were no longer the
sole motives of visiting diflant lands. The desire of gain
became a new incentive to activity, routed adventurers and sent
them forth upon long voyages in search of countries, whose
products or wants might increase that circulation, which nou-
rilhes and gives vigour to commerce. Trade proved a great
source of discovery, it opened unknown eas, it penetrated into'
new regions, and contributed more than any other cause, to'
bring men acquainted with the situation, the nature, and com-
modities of the different parts of the globe. But even after a
regular commerce was eablifed in the world, after nations
were considerably ci4ilized, and the sciences and arts were
cultivated with ardour and success, navigation continued to-
be so imperfedt, that it can hardly be said to have ad-
vanced beyond the infancy of its improvement in the ancient,
world.

mperfeaion AMONG all the nations of antiquity the ftiruure of their
of navigation
among the vefels was extremely rude, and their method of working them
ancients, very defeQive. They were unacquainted with ome of the

great principles and operations in navigation, which are now
confidered as the firlt elements on which that science is founded.
Though that property of the magnet, by which it attracts iron,
was well known to the ancients, its moil important and amazing
virtue of pointing to the poles had entirely escaped their obfer-
vation. Dlli tute of this faithful guide, which now condults
the pilot with to much certainty in the unbounded ocean, during
the darkness of night, and when the heavens are covered with
clouds, the ancients had no other method of regulating their

course

course than by observing the fun and flars. Their navigation B 0 1 K
was of consequence uncertain and timid. They durst seldom .---J-
quit fight of land, but crept along the coast, exposed to all the
dangers, and retarded by all the obftrudions, unavoidable in
holding such an aukward course. An incredible length of time
was requisite for performing voyages, which are now finiihed
in a short space. Even in the mildest climates, and in seas the
least tempestuous, it was only during the summer months that
the ancients ventured out of their harbours. The remainder
of the year was loft in inactivity. It would have been deemed
most inconsiderate rashness to have braved the fury of the'
winds and waves during the winter .

WHILE both the science and practice of navigation conti-

nued to be so defective, it was an undertaking of no small diffi-
culty and danger to visit any remote region of the earth. Under
every disadvantage, however, the aftive spirit of commerce ex-
erted itself. The Egyptians, soon after the establishment of Navigation
their monarchy, are said to have opened a trade between the arceoftle
Arabian Gulph or Red Sea, and the western coast of the great Egypti'ns.
Indian continent. The commodities which they imported from
the east, were carried by land from the Arabian Gulph to the
banks of the Nile, and conveyed down that river to the Me-
diterranean. But if the Egyptians in early times applied them-
selves to commerce, their attention to it was of short duration.
The fertile foil and mild climate of Egypt produced the ne-
ceifaries and comforts of life with fichl profuion, as rendered
its inhabitants Ib independent of other countries, that it became
an cftabliflcd maxim among that people, whose ideas and infti-

._--_.--' tions, to renounce all intercourse with foreigners. In confe-

quence of this, they never went out of their own country; they
held all sea-faring persons in detefiation, as impious and pro-
fane; and fortifying their own harbours, they denied itrangers
admittance into them b; and i was in the decline of their

of thePhe- THE character and situation of the Phenicians were as favour-

i. able to the spirit of commerce and discovery as those of the

Egyptians were adverse to it. They had no diftinguifllig pe-
culiarity in their manners and inflitutions; they were not
addicted to any singular and unsocial form of fiperflition; they
could mingle with other nations without scruple or reluctance.
The territory which they poffefled was neither large nor fertile.
Commerce was the only source from which they could derive
opulence or power. Accordingly, the trade carried on by the
Phenicians of Sidon and Tyre, was more extensive and enter-
prizing than that of any state in the ancient world. The ge-
nius of the Phenicians, as well as the objet of their policy and
the spirit of their laws, were entirely commercial. They were
a people of merchants who aimed at the empire of the ea, and
actually possessed it. Their flips not only frequented all the
ports in the Mediterranean, but they were the firif who ven-
tured beyond the ancient boundaries of navigation, and passing
the Streights of Gadcs, vilited the weflcrn coafls of Spain and
Africa. In many of the places to which they rcforted, they
planted colonies, and communicated to the rude inhabitants

extended their discoveries towxrds the north and the wefl, they '-
did not negle& to penetrate into the more opulent and fertile
regions of the south and east. Having rendered themselves
mailers of several commodious harbours towards the bottom of
the Arabian Gulph, they, after the example of the Egyptians,
eflablifhed a regular intercourse with Arabia and the continent
of India on the one hand, and with the eastern coast of Africa
on the other. From there countries they imported many valu-
able commodities, unknown to the reft of the world, and, dur--
ing a long pericd, engrossed that lucrative branch of commerce
without a rival c.

lizing the trade carried on in the Red Sea, incited their neigh-
bours the Jews, under the prosperous reigns of David and So-
lomon, to aim at being admitted to some hare of it. This
they obtained, partly by their conquest of Idumea, which
itretches along the Red Sea, and partly by their alliance with
Hiram king of Tyre. Solomon fitted out fleets, which, under
the direction of Phenician pilots, failed from the Red Sea to
Tarshish and Ophir. These it is probable were ports in India
and Africa which their conductors were accustomcd to frequent,
and from them returned with ficli valuable cargoes as fiddenly
diffused wealth and fllcndour through the kingdom of Israel .

latry,

B Ooo K latry, formed a national charaaer incapable of that open and

.---' liberal intercourse with itrangers which commerce requires.

Accordingly, this unsocial genius of the people, together with
the disasters which besel the kingdom of Israel, prevented the
commercial spirit which their monarchs laboured to introduce,
and to cherish, from spreading among them. The Jews cannot
be numbered among the nations which contributed to improve
navigation, or to extend discovery.

Of the Car- BUT though the inftruaions and example of the Phenicians

were unable to mould the manners and temper of the Jews, in
opposition to the tendency of their laws, they transmitted the
commercial spirit with facility, and in full vigour, to their own
descendants the Carthaginians. The commonwealth of Car-
thage applied to trade and to naval affairs, with no less ardour,
ingenuity, and success, than its parent ate. Carthage early
rivalled, and oon surpassed Tyre, in opulence and power, but
seems not to have aimed at obtaining any Ihare in the commerce
with India. The Phenicians had engrossed this, and had such
a command of the Red Sea as secured to them the exclusive pof-
feefion of that lucrative branch of trade. The commercial ai-
vity of the Carthaginians was exerted in another diretion.
Without contending for the trade of the cast with their mother-
country, they extended their navigation chiefly towards the
wefl and north. Following the course which the Phenicians had
opened, they paflcd the Streights of Gades, and pufling their
difcovcries far beyond thole of the parent fate, visited not only
all the oasIS of Spain, but tliofc of Gaul, and penetrated at last
into Britain. At the fItmc time that they acquired knowledge of
new countries in this part of' the globe, they gradually carried
thchi refearclics towards_ the South, They made confidlcrable

pt og-cfs,

progress, by land, into the interior provinces of Africa, traded B O O K
with ome of them, and subjeCted others to their empire. --.
They failed along the western coast of that great continent, al-
most to the tropic of Cancer, and planted several colonies, in
order to civilize the natives, and accustom them to commerce.
They discovered the Fortunate Islands, now known by the name
of the Canaries, the utmost boundary of ancient navigation in
the western ocean'.

NOR was the progress of the Phenicians and Carthaginians

in their knowledge of the globe, owing entirely to the desire of
extending their trade from one country to another. Commerce
was followed by its usual effects among both there people. It
awakened curiosity, enlarged the ideas and desires of men, and
incited them to bold enterprises. Voyages were undertaken, the
sole object of which was to discover new countries, and explore
unknown eas. Such, during the prosperous age of the Cartha-
ginian republic, were the famous navigations of Hanno and
Himilco. Both their fleets were equipped by authority of the
senate, and at public expence. Hanno was directed to fleer
towards the south, along the coast of Africa, and seems to have
advanced much nearer the equinotial line than any former na-
vigator f. Himilco had it in charge to proceed towards the
north, and to examine the weflern coasts of the European con-
tinent . Of the fame nature was the extraordinary navigation
of the Phenicians round Africa. A Phenician fleet, we are
told, fitted out by Necho king of Egypt, took its departure

B 0 0 K about fix hundred and four years before the Christian era,
--_-- fiomn a port in the Red Sea, doubled the southern promontory

of Africa, and, after a voyage of three years, returned by the
Strcights of Gades, to the mouth of the Nile . Eudoxus of
Cyzicus is said to have held the fame course, and. to have accom-
plifhed the fame arduous undertaking .

THESE voyages, if performed in the manner which I have

related, may justly be reckoned the greatest effort of navigation
in the ancient world; and if we attend to the imperfect fate of
the art at that time, it is difficult to determine, whether we
should most admire the courage and sagacity with which the
design was formed, or the conduct and good fortune with which
it was executed. But unfortunately, all the original and au-
thentic accounts of the Phenician and Carthaginian voyages, whe-
ther undertaken by public authority, or in prosecution of their
private trade, have perished. The information which we receive
concerning them from the Greek and Roman authors, is not only
obscure and inaccurate, but, if we except a hort narrative of
Hanno's expedition, is of suspicious authority k. Whatever ac-
quaintance with the remote regions of the earth the Phenicians
or Carthaginians may have acquired, was concealed from the reft
of mankind with a mercantile jealousy. Every thing relative
to the course of their navigation was not only a myflery of
trade, but a secret of slate. Extraordinary fads are recorded
concerning their solicitude to prevent other nations from pe-
netrating into what they wished should remain undivulged .
Many of their discoverics seem, accordingly, to have been
scarcely known beyond the precinds of their own states. The

navigation round Africa, in particular, is recorded by the Greek B °°0 K
and Roman writers, rather as a firange amusing tale, which '--
they either did not comprehend, or did not believe, than as a
real tranfaaion, which enlarged their knowledge and influenced
their opinion'". As neither the progress of the Phenician and

their extraordinary skill in naval affairs seem, in a great mea-
sure, to have periflhcd, when the maritime power of the for-

Grctks.

Phenician and Carthaginian voyages to the curiosity and con-
jeaures of antiquaries, history must reft satisfied with relating
the progress of navigation and discovery among the Greeks and
Romans, which, though less splendid, is better ascertained.
It is evident that the Phenicians, who inftruaed the Greeks in
other useful sciences and arts, did not communicate to them
that extensive knowledge of navigation which they themselves
pofleffed; nor did the Romans imbibe that commercial spirit and
ardour for discovery which diftinguified the Carthaginians.
Though Greece be almost cncompaflcd by the efa, which form-
ed many spacious bays and commodious harbours, though it be
surrounded by a vast number of fertile ifands, yet, notwith-
flanding such a favourable situation, which fecmed to invite
that ingenious people to apply themselves to navigation, it was
long before this art attained any degree of perfcl.ion among
them. Their early voyages, the ol)jea of which was piracy
rather than commerce, were so incoliderable, that the cxpedi-

v s-- ·ea, appeared ich an amazing effort of ikill and courage, as

entitled the condudors of it to be ranked among the demigods,.
and exalted the vefl1e in which they failed to a place among the-
heavenly confellations. Even at a later period, when the Greeks
engaged in their famous entcrprize againfl Troy, their know-
ledge in naval affairs seems not to have been much improved.
According to the account of Homer, the only poet to whom
hillory ventures to appeal, and who, by his scrupulous accu-
racy in describing the manners and arts of early ages, merits
this dilinCtion, the science of navigation, at that time, had
hardly advanced beyond its rudefl state. The Greeks in the
heroic age were unacquainted with the use of iron, the molf
serviceable of all the metals, without which no considerable
progress was evera.made in the mechanical arts. Their vessels
were'of inconsiderable burthen, and moflly without decks.
These had only one mast, which they erected or took down at
pleasure. They were strangers to the use of anchors. All
their operations in failing were clumsy and unskilful. They
turned their observation towards flars, which were improper
for regulating their course, and their mode of observing them
was inaccurate and fallacious. When they had finished a
voyage they drew their paltry barks ashore, as savages do their
canoes, and there remained on dry land until the season of re-
turning to ea approached. It is not then in the early or heroic
ages of Greece, that we can expec to observe the science of
navigation, and the spirit of discovery making any considerable
progress. During that period of disorder and ignorance, a
thoufhnd causes concurred in refiraining curiosity and enterprize
within very narrow bounds.

BUT the Greeks advanced with rapidity to a slate of B 00 K

greater civilization and refinement. Government, in its most
liberal and perfect form, began to be eflablifled in the com-
munities of Greece; equal laws and regular police were
gradually introduced; the sciences and arts which arc useful
or ornamental in life were carried to a high pitch of improve-
ment, and several of the Grecian commonwealths applied to
commerce with such ardour and success, that they were con-
fidered, in the ancient world, as maritime powers of the sirs:
rank. Even then, however, the naval viAories of the Greeks
muff be ascribed rather to the native spirit of the people, and
to that courage which the enjoyment of liberty inspires, than
to any extraordinary progress in the science of navigation. In
the Persian war, those exploits which the eloquence of the
Greek historians have rendered so famous, were performed
by fleets, composed chiefly of small vessels without decks ;
the crews of which ruffed forward with impetuous valour,
but little art, to board those of the enemy. In the war of
Peloponnefus, their fliips seem flill to have been of inconfi-
derable burthen and force. The extent of their trade was
in proportion to this low condition of their marine. The ma-
ritime states of Greece hardly carried on any commerce be-
yond the limits of the Mediterranean ea. Their chief inter-
course was with the colonies of their countrymen, planted in
the lesser Asia, in Italy and Sicily. They sometimes visited the
ports of Egypt, of Gaul, and of Thrace, or pafling through
the Hellelpont, they traded with the countries ituated around
the Euxine tea. Amazing instances occur of their ignorance,
even of those countries, .which lay within the narrow precinCa

B 0 0 K to which their navigation was confined. When the Greeks

--"--t ' had assembled their combined fleet against Xerxes at Egina,

they thought it unadvifable to fail to Samos, becaufb they be-
lieved the distance between that island and Egina to be as great
as the distance between gina and the Pillars of Hercules °
They were either utterly unacquainted with all the parts of
the globe beyond the Mediterranean sea, or what knowledge
they had of them was founded on conjeaure, or derived from
the information of a few persons, whom curiosity and the love
of science had prompted to travel by land into the Upper Asia,
or by ea into Egypt, the ancient feats of wisdom and arts.
After all that the Greeks learned from them, they appear to
have been ignorant of the most important fads, on which an
accurate and scientific knowledge of the globe is founded.

THE expedition of Alexander the Great into the eaf-, confi-

derably enlarged the sphere of navigation and of geographical
knowledge among the Greeks. That extraordinary man, not-
withstanding the violent passions which incited him, at tome
times, to the wildest actions, and the most extravagant enter-
prises, possessed talents which fitted him not only to conquer,
but to govern the world. He was capable of framing those bold
and original schemes of policy, which gave a new form to hu-
man affairs. The revolution in commerce, brought about by
the force of his genius, is hardly inferior to that revolution in
empire, occasioned by the success of his arms. It is probable,
that the opposition and efforts of the republic of Tyrc, which
checked him so long in the career of his victories, gave Alex-
ander an opportunity of observing the vait refourccs of a mari-

wealth which the Tyrians derived from their commerce, efpe-
cially that with the Eafr Indies. As oon as he had accomplish-
ed the deftrucion of Tyre; and reduced Egypt to fibjedion,
he formed the plan of rendering the empire which he pur-
posed to cftablifli, the centre of commerce as well as the feat
of dominion. With this view he founded a great city, which
he honoured with his own name, near one of the mouths of
the river Nile, that by the Mediterranean sea, and the neigh-
bourhood of the Arabian Gulf, it might command the trade
both of the eaRl and weft P. This lituation was cholcn with
such discernment, that Alexandria soon became the chief com-
mercial city in the world. Not only during the fubfilence of
the Grecian empire in Egypt and in the eall, but amila all the
successive revolutions in those countries, from the time of the
Ptolemies to the discovery of the Navigation by the Cape of
Good Hope, commerce, particularly that of the East Indies,
continued to flow in the channel which the sagacity and fore-
fight of Alexander had marked out for it.

His ambition was not satisfied with having opened to the

Greeks a communication with India by sea; he aspired to the so-
vereignty. of those regions which furnished the reft of mankind'
with so many precious commodities, and conduced his army thi;
ther by land. Enterprising, however, as lie was, he may be si.
rather to have dilcovcrcd, than to have conquered that country.
He did not, in his progress towards the eafl, advance beyond the
banks of the rivers that fall into the Indus, which is now the
wcllcrn boundary of the vafl continent of India. Amidst the

B 0 0 IK wild exploits which distinguish this part of his hiltory, he
v_,_^ pursued measures that mark the superiority of his genius, as

well as the extent of his views. He had penetrated as far into
India as to confirm his opinion of its commercial importance,
and to perceive that immense wealth might be derived from in-
tercourfe with a country, where the arts of elegance having
been more early cultivated, were arrived at greater perfection
than in any other part of the earth . Full of this idea, he re-
iblved to examine the course of navigation from the mouth of
the Indus to the bottom of the Persian Gulf; and if it mould be
found practicable, to eftablifl a regular communication between
them. In order to effeQ this, he proposed to remove the cata-
rats, with which, thejealoufy of the Persians, and their aversion
to correspondence with foreigners, had obftruded the entrance
into the Euphrates ;; to carry the commodities of the east up
that river, and the Tigris, which unites with it, into the inte-
rior parts of his Asiatic dominions; while, by the way of
the Arabian Gulf, and the river Nile, they might be con-
veyed to Alexandria, and distributed to the reft of the world.
Nearchus, an officer of eminent abilities, was entrusted with the
command of the fleet fitted out for this expedition. He per-
formed this voyage, which was deemed an enterprise o ardu-
ous and important, that Alexander reckoned it one of the most
extraordinary events which distinguished his reign. Inconfi-
derable as it may now appear, it was, at that time, an under-
taking of no little merit and difficulty. In the prosecution of
it, friking inflances occur of the finall pogrefs which the
Greeks had made in naval knowledge . Having never failed

beyond the bounds of the Mediterranean, where the ebb and B o o I0
flow of the sea are hardly perceptible, when they first obicrved -,---
this phenomenon at the mouth of the Indus, it appeared to
them a prodigy, by which the gods teflified the difpleafiire ol'
Heaven against their enterprise'. During their whole course,
they seem never to have loft fight of land, but followed the
bearings of the coast so servilely, that they could not much
avail themselves of those periodical winds, which facilitate na-
vigation in the Indian ocean. Accordingly, they spent no less
than ten months" in performing this voyage, Which, fiom the
mouth of the Indus to that of the Persian gulf, does not ex-
ceed twenty degrees. It is probable, that amidst the violent
convulsions, and frequent revolutions in the East, occasioned
by the contests among the fucceflors of Alexander, the naviga-
tion to India, by the course which Nearchus had opened, was
discontinued. The Indian trade carried on at Alexandria, not
only subsisted, but was so much extended under the Grecian
monarchs of Egypt, that it p.oved a great source of the wealth
which distinguished their kingdom.

THE progress which the Romans made in navigation and OftlheRo.

discovery, was fill more inconsiderable than that of the Greeks.
The genius of the Roman people, their military education,
and the spirit of their laws, concurred in eranging them from
commerce and naval affairs. It was the necessity of opposing a
formidable rivals not the desire of extending trade, which first
prompted them to aim at maritime power. Though they soon
perceived that, in order to acquire the universal dominion after
which they aspired, it was necefiary to render themselves mailers
of the sea, they still confidered the naval service as a fubor-

_.-_--- rank to be admitted into the legions x. In the hifiory of the

Roman republic, hardly one event occurs, that marks attention
to navigation any farther than as it was instrumental towards
conquell. When the Roman valour and discipline had subdued
all the maritime fiates known in the ancient world; when Car-
thage, Greece, and Egypt, had submitted to their power, the
Romans did not imbibe the commercial spirit of the conquered
nations. Among that people of soldiers, to have applied to
trade would have been deemed a degradation of a Roman ci-
tizen. They abandoned the mechanical arts, commerce, and
navigation, to slaves, to freedmen, to provincials, and to ci-
tizens of the lowest class. Even after the fubverlion of liberty,
when the severity and haughtiness of ancient manners began to
abate, commerce did not rife into high estimation among the
Romans. The trade of Greece, Egypt, and the other conquered
countries, continued to be carried on in its usual channels,
after they were reduced into the form of Roman provinces.
As Rome was the capital of the world, and the feat of govern-
ment, all the wealth and valuable productions of the provinces
flowed naturally thither. The Romans, satisfied with this,
seem to have fuf-red commerce to remain alinoft entirely in the
hands of the natives of the refpedive countries. The extent,
however, of the Roman power, which reached over the greatefl
part of the known world, the vigilant infpetion of the Roman
magifirates, and the spirit of the Roman government, no
less intelligent than aive, gave such additional security to
commerce, as animated it with new vigour. The union
among nations was never so entire, nor the intercourse so per-
sect, as within the bounds of this vail empire. Commerce,

under the Roman dominion, was not obflruded by the jealousy B oo0 K
of rival fates, interrupted by frequent hostilities, or limited by _--
partial reltricions. One superintending power moved and re-
gulated the industry of mankind, and enjoyed the fruits of
their joint efforts.

NAVIGATION felt this influence, and improved under it.

As soon as the Romans acquired a taste for the lixuries of
the Eaf, the trade with India through Egypt was pufled
with new vigour, and carried on to greater extent. By fre-
quenting the Indian continent, navigators became acquainted
with the periodical course of the winds, which, in the ocean
that separates Africa from India, blow with little variation
during one half of the year from the eart, and during the
other half fix with equal steadiness in the weft. Encouraged
by observing this, they abandoned their ancient flow and dan-
gerous course along the coast, and as soon as the western mon-
soon set in, took their departure from Ocelis, at the mouth of
the Arabian gulf, and firetched boldly across the ocean .
The uniform direcion of the wind, fipplying the place of the
cornpafs, and rendering the guidance of the stars less necessary,
condued them to the port of Mufiris, on the wefiern fiore
of the Indian continent. There they took on board their
cargo, and returning with the ealtern nonfoon, finiflced their
voyage to the Arabian gulf within the year. This part of
India, now known by the name of the Malabar coast, fecms to
have been the utmost limit of ancient navigation in tlat quar-
ter of the globe. What imprfecl- knowledge the ancients had
of the immense countries which firetch beyond this towards
the cast, they received fiom a few adventurers, who had vilitcd
them by) land. Their cxcurfions were not extensive, and it is
probable, tlat while tie Roman intercouric with India sub-

»-- ' the Ganges'. The fleets from Egypt which traded at Mufiris,

were loaded, it is true, with the spices and other rich commo-
dities of the continent and islands of the farther India; but
these were brought to that port, which became the staple of
this commerce, by the Indians themselves, in canoes made of
one tree . The Egyptian and Roman merchants, satisfied with
acquiring there commodities in this manner, did not think it
necessary to explore unknown seas, and venture upon a dan-
gerous navigation, in quest of the countries which produced
them. But though the discoveries of the Romans in India
were so limited, their commerce there was such as will appear
considerable, even to the present age, in which the Indian trade
has been extended far beyond the practice or conception of
any preceding period. We are informed by one author of cre-
dit b, that the commerce with India drained the Roman empire
every year of more than four hundred thousand pounds; and
by another, that one hundred and twenty hips failed annually
from the Arabian gulf to that country .

continuance of the Roman power. But in ancient times, the
knowledge of countries was acquired more by land than by
sea d; and the Romans, from their peculiar disinclination to
naval affairs, may be said to have neglected totally the latter,
though a more easy and expeditious method of discovery.
The progress, however, of their vicorious armies contributed
greatly to extend discovery by land, and even opened the na-
vigation of new and unknown seas. Previous to the Roman

conqueits, the civilized nations of antiquity had no communi- B O KI
ation with those countries in Europe, which now form its -
mos opulent and powerful kingdoms. The interior parts of
Spain and of Gaul were little known. Britain, separated from
the reft of the world, had never been visited, except by its
neighbours the Gauls, and by a few Carthaginian merchants.
The name of Germany had scarcely been heard of. Into all'
these countries the arms of the Romans penetrated. They en-
tirely subdued Spain and Gaul; they conquered the greatest
and most fertile part of Britain; they advanced into Germany,
as far as the banks of the river Elbe. In Africa, they ac-
quired a considerable knowledge of the provinces, which stretch
along the Mediterranean sea, from Egypt westward to the
straits of Gades. In Asia, they not only subjected to their
power most of the provinces which composed the Persian and
Macedonian empires, but, after their victories over Mithridates
and Tigranes, they seem to have made a more accurate survey
of the countries contiguous to the Euxine and Caspian seas,
and to have carried on a more extensive trade than that of the
Greeks with the opulent and commercial nations, then feated
around the Euxine sea.

*-*"TI

B 0 0 K authentic history, without fubflituting in its place the conjec-
'-p---' tures of fancy, or the dreams of etymologists, we must concludei,

that the knowledge which the ancients had acquired of the ha-
bitable globe was extremely confined. In Europe, the extensive
provinces in the eastern part of Germany were hardly known
to them. They were almost totally unacquainted with the vast
countries which are now subjee to the kings of Denmark, Swe-
den, Prussia, Poland, and the Ruffian empire. The more bar-
ren regions, that stretch within the arctic circle, were quite
unexplored. In Africa, their researches did not extend far
beyond the provinces which border on the Mediterranean, and
those situated on the western ihore of the Arabian gulf. In
Asia, they were unacquainted, as I formerly observed, with all
the fertile and opulent countries beyond the Ganges, which
furnish the mol .valuable commodities that, in modern times,
have been the great object of the European commerce with
India; nor do they seem to have ever penetrated into those
immense regions occupied by the wandering tribes, which they
called by the general name of Sarmatians or Scythians, and
now poqfeffed by Tartars of various denominations, and by the
Asiatic fubjed's of Russia.

A remarkable PUT there is one opinion, that universally prevailed among
ITo'so f this.

the ancients, which conveys a more firiking idea of the finall
progrels they ihad made in the knowledge of the habitable globe,
than can be derived from any detail of their discoveries. They
supposed the earth to be divided into five regions, which they
diltinguifhed by the nane .of zoncs. Two of there, which were
nearest the Poles, they termned fi!igid zones, and believed taat
the extreme cold which reigned perpetually there, rendered
them uninhabitablc. Another, feated undet the line, and ex-

o tending

tending on either fide towards the tropics, they called the torrid B o0 ;.
zone, and imagined it to be so burnt up with unremitting heat, tL.-..
as to be equally destitute of inhabitants. On the two other
zones, which occupied the remainder of the earth, they be-
flowed the appellation of temperate, and taught that these,
being the only regions in which life could subsist, were allotted
to man for his habitation. This wild opinion was not a
conceit of the uninformed vulgar, or a fanciful fiOtion of the
poets, but a system adopted by the most enlightened philofo-
phers, the most accurate hiflorians and geographers in Greece
and Rome. According to this theory, a vast portion of the
habitable earth was pronounced to be unfit for sustaining the
human fpccies. Those fertile and populous regions within the
torrid zone, which are now known not only to yield their own
inhabitants the necessaries and comforts of life, with most
luxuriant profusion, but to communicate their superfluous flores
to the reft of the world, were supposed to be the mansion of
perpetual sterility and desolation. As all the parts of the globe,
which the ancients had discovered, lay within the northern
temperate zone, their opinion that the other temperate zone
was filled with inhabitants, was founded on reasoning and
conjecture, not on discovery. They even believed that, by the
intolerable heat of the torrid zone, fich an insuperable barrier
was placed between the two temperate regions of the earth, as
would prevent for ever any intercourse between their refpelive
inhabitants. Thus this extravagant theory not only proves
that the ancients were unacquainted with the true slate of the
globe, but it tended to render their ignorance perpetual, by
reprefcnting all attempts towards opening a communication with-
the remote regions of the earth, as utterly impraclicable'

times. As long as the Roman empire retained such vigour as
to preserve its authority over the conquered nations, and to
keep.them united, it was an object of public police, as well as
of private curiosity, to examine and describe the countries
which composed this great body. Even when the other sciences
began to decline, geography, enriched with new observations,
and receiving ome acceflion from the experience of every
age, and the reports of every traveller, continued to improve.
It attained to the'higheft point of perfection and accuracy to
which it ever arrived in the ancient world, by the industry

barbarous
nations. changing the feat of government, divided and weakened its

force; the barbarous nations, which Providence prepared as
its iniftruments to overturn the mighty fabric of the Roman
power, began to assemble and to mufler their armies on its
frontier; the empire tottered to its fall. During this decline
and old age of the Roman ltate, it was impossible that the
sciences hould go on improving. The efforts of genius were,
at that period, as languid and feeble as those of government.

From

Frofn the time of Ptolemy, no considerable addition seems to B O O K
have been made to geographical knowledge, nor did any im- '-----
portant revolution happen in trade, excepting that Conftan-
tinople, by its advantageous situation, and the encouragement
of the eastern emperors, became a commercial city of the firfl
note.

AT length, the clouds which had been so long gathering Ef.ftls of

their con.

round the Roman empire, burfl into a storm. The barbarous queils on
nations rushed in with irresistible impetuolity, and, in the ge- intercourtac
neral wreck, occasioned by the inundation which overwhelmed
Europe, the arts', sciences, inventions and discoveries of the
Romans, perished and disappeared . All the various tribes,
which fettled in the different provinces of the Roman em-
pire, were uncivilized, firangers to letters, deflitute of arts,
unacquainted with regular government, subordination, or
laws. The manners and inflitutions of ome of them were
so rude and barbarous, as to be hardly compatible with a state
of social union. Europe, when occupied by such inhabitants,
may be said to have returned to a second infancy, and had to
begin anew its career in improvement, science, and civility.
The first effea: of the settlement of those barbarous invaders
was to dissolve the union by which the Roman power had ce-
mented mankind together. They parcelled out Europe into
many small and independent flates, differing from each other
in language and cutfoms. No intercourse subsisted between the
members of those divided and holtile communities. Accustom-
ed to a simple mode of life, and averse to industry, they had
few wants to supply, and no superfluitics to dispose of. The
names of flranger and of enemy became once more words of

an extensive commerce can be carried on, were few, incon-
fiderable, and destitute of those immunities which produce fe-
curity or excite enterprise. The sciences, on which geography
and navigation are founded, were not cultivated. The ac-
counts of ancient improvements and discoveries, contained in
the Greek and Roman authors, were negleted or mifunder-
flood. The knowledge of remote regions was loft, their situ-
ation, their commodities, and almost their names, were un-
known.

over the reft of Europe, was so fortunate as to escape their de-
firuaive rage. In that city, the knowledge of ancient arts and
discoveries was preserved; a taste for splendour and elegance
subsisted; the productions and luxuries of foreign countries
were in request; and commerce continued to flourifl there,
when it was almost extinct in every other part of Europe. The
citizens of Constantinople did not confine their trade to the
islands of the Archipelago, or to the adjacent coasts of Asia;
they took a wider range, and following the course which the
ancients had marked out, imported the commodities of the
East Indies from Alexandria. When Egypt was torn from the
Roman empire by the Arabians, the industry of the Greeks
discovercd a new channel, by which the productions of India
inight be conveyed to Constantinople. They were carried up

they were transported by land to the banks of the river Oxus, '----
and proceeded down its fiream to the Caspian ea. There they
entered the Volga, and failing up it, were carried by land to
the Tanais, which conducted them into the Euxine sea, where
veflels from Constantinople waited their arrivalh. This extra-
ordinary and tedious mode of conveyance merits attention, not
only as a proof of the violent passion which the inhabitants of
Constantinople had conceived for the luxuries of the east, and
as a specimen of the ardour and ingenuity with which they
carried on commerce, but because it demonstrates, that, during
the ignorance which reigned in the reft of Europe, an exten-
five knowledge of remote countries was still preserved in the ca-
pital of the Greek empire.

AT the fame time, a gleam of light and knowledge broke in and among

upon the east. The Arabians, having contracted ome relish e
for the sciences of the people whose empire they had contri-
buted to overturn, translated the books of several of the Greek
philosophers into their own language. One of the first was
that valuable work of Ptolemy, which I have already men-
tioned. The study of geography became, of consequence, an
early objec of attention to the Arabians. But that acute and
ingenious people cultivated chiefly the speculative and scientific
parts of geography. In order to ascertain the figure and dimen-
sions of the terrestrial globe, they applied the principles of ge-
ometry, they had recourse to afironomical obfcrvations, they
employed experiments and operations, which Europe, in more
enlightened times, has been proud to adopt and to imitate.

Revivalof BY degrees, the calamities and desolation brought upon the
dommerce western provinces of the Roman empire by its barbarous con-
lion in Ei- querors, were forgotten, and in ome measure repaired. The

rude tribes which fettled there, acquiring insensibly bome idea
of regular government, and ome relish for the functions and
comforts of civil life, Europe began to awake from its torpid
and unadive slate. The first symptoms of revival were dif-
cerned in Italy. The northern tibes which took possession of
this country, made progress in improvement with greater ra-
pidity than the people fettled in other parts of Europe. Va-
rious causes, wlich it is not the object of this work to enumerate
or explain, concurred in restoring liberty and independence to
the cities of Italy . The acquisition of these roused indu-firy,
and gave motion and vigour to all the ative powers of the hu-
man mind. Foreign commerce revived, navigation was at-
tended to and improved. Constantinople became the chief
mart to which the Italians resorted. There they not only met
with a favourable reception, but obtained such mercantile pri-
vileges as enabled them to carry on trade with great advan-
tage. They were supplied both with the precious commo-
dities of the east, and with many curious manufatures, the
product of the ancient arts and ingenuity which fill subsisted-
among the Greeks. As the labour and expence of conveying
the produEtions of India to Conflantinople by that long and in-

discovered other methods of procuring them in greater abun- B 0 0 K
dance, and at an easier rate. They ometimes purchased them -,--
in Aleppo, Tripoli, and other ports on the coast of Syria, to
which they were brought by a route not unknown to the an-
cients. They were conveyed from India by sea, up the Per-
fian Gulf, and acending the Euphrates and Tigris, as far as
3agdat, were carried by land across the Desert to Palmyra, and
from thence to the towns on the Mediterranean. But from the
length of the journey, and the dangers to which the caravans
were exposed, this proved always a tedious, and often a preca-
rious mode of conveyance. At length, the Soldans of Egypt;
having renewed the commerce with India in its ancient chan-
nel, by the Arabian Gulf, the Italian merchants, notwith-
flanding the violent antipathy to each other with which Chri-
flians and the followers of Mahomet were then possessed, re-
paired to Alexandria, and enduring, from the love of gains
the insolence and exations of the Mahometans, established a
lucrative trade in that port. From that period, the commercial
spirit of Italy became aaive and enterprising. Venice, Gcnoa~
Pisa, rose from inconsiderable towns, to be populous and weal-
thy cities. Their naval power increased; their vessels fre-
quented not only all the ports in the Mediterranean, but ven-
turing ometimes beyond the Streights, vilited the maritime
towns of Spain, France, the Low Countries, and England; and,
by distributing their commodities over Europe, began to com-
municate to its various nations some taste for the valuable pro-
dutions of the east, as well as some ideas of manufactures and
arts, which were then unknown beyond the precincts of Italy.

WHILE the cities of Italy were thus advancing in their career Tl'ii pro.

of improvement,. an event happened, the most extraordinary by thle Cr-

perhaps id,

B 00 K perhaps in the history of mankind, which, instead of retarding
'-.----' the commercial progress of the Italians, rendered it more ra-

pid. The martial spirit of the Europeans, heightened and in-
flamed by religious zeal, prompted them to deliver the Holy
Land from the dominion of infidels. Valf armies, composed
of all the nations of Europe, marched towards Asia, upon this
wild enterprise. The Genoese, the Pifans, aud Venetians
furnished the transports which carried them thither. They
supplied them with provisions and military flores. Beside the
immense fums which they received on this account, they ob-
tained commercial privileges and eflablifhments, of great con-
sequence in the ettlements which the Crusaders made in Pa-
leftine, and in other provinces of Asia. From those sources,
prodigious wealth flowed into the cities which I have mentioned.
This was accompanied with a proportional increase of power,
and by the- end of the Holy War, Venice, in particular,
became a great maritime slate, possessing an extensive com-
merce, and ample territories k. Italy was not the only coun-
try in which the Crusades contributed to revive and diffuse such
a spirit as prepared Europe for future discoveries. By their
expeditions into Asia, the other European nations became well
acquainted with remote regions, which formerly they knew
only by name, or by the reports of ignorant and credulous pil-
grims. They had an opportunity of observing the manners,
the arts, and the accommodations of people more polifled
than themselves. This intercourse between the east and well
subsisted almost two centuries. The adventurers, who returned
from Asia, communicated to their countrymen the ideas which
they had acquired, and the habits of life they had contrated
by visiting more refined nations. The Europeans began to be

sensible of wants with which they were formerly unacquainted ; B 0 K
new desires were excited; and such a taste for the commodities '- ·-
and arts of other countries gradually spread among them, that
they not only encouraged the resort of foreigners to their har-
bours, but began to perceive the advantage and necessity of ap-
plying to commerce themselves'.

THIS communication, which was opened between Europe bythedifco-

veries of tra-

and the western provinces of Asia, encouraged several persons velersby
to advance far beyond the countries in which the Crusaders land.
carried on their operations, and to travel by land into the more
remote and opulent regions of the east. The wild fanaticism,
which seems at that period to have mingled in all the schemes
of individuals, no less than in all the counsels of nations, first
incited men to enter upon those long and dangerous peregrina-
tions. They were afterwards undertaken from profpecs of
commercial advantage, or from motives of mere curiosity. Ben-
jamin, a Jew of Tudela, in the kingdom of Navarre, possessed
with a superstitious veneration for the law of Moses, and soli-
citous to visit his countrymen in the eafi, whom he hoped to
find in such a state of power and opulence, as might redound
to the honour of his fee, set out from Spain in the year I i6o,
and travelling by land to Constantinople, proceeded through
the countries to the north of the Euxine and Caspian eas, as
far as Chinese Tartary. From thence he took his route towards
the south, and after traversing various provinces of the farther
India, he embarked on the Indian ocean, visited several of its
islands, and returned at the end of thirteen years, by the way of
Egypt, to Europe, with much information concerning a large
diftrid of the globe, altogether unknown at that time to the

J co-operated with the fuperflition of Benjamin the Jew, in dif-

covering the interior and remote provinces of Asia. All Chris-

grefs of the Tartar arms under Zengis Khan, Innocent IV. who
entertained inolt exalted ideas concerning the plenitude of his

John de Piano Carpini, at the head of a mifflon of Franciscan
monks, and father Afcolino, at the head of another of Domi-
nicans, to exhort Kayuk Khan, the grandson of Zengis, who
was then at the head of the Tartar empire, to embrace the
Christian faith, and to desist from desolating the earth by his
arms. The haughty descendant of the greatest conqueror Asia
had ever beheld, afonifhed at this firange mandate from an
Italian prieif, whose name and ju-rifdiCion were alike unknown
to him, received it with the contempt which it merited, though
he difmifed the mendicants who delivered it with impunity.
But as they had penetrated into the country by different routes,
and followed for some time the Tartar camps, which were
always in motion, they had an opportunity of visiting a great
part of Asia. Carpini, who proceeded by the way of Poland
and Russia, travelled through its northern provinces as far as
the extremities of Thibet. Afcolino, who seems to have landed
somewhere in Syria, advanced through its southern provinces,
into the interior parts of Persia .

having informed him that a powerful Chan of the Tartars had
embraced the Christian faith, the monarch listencd to the tale
with pious credulity, and instantly resolved to fend ambassadors
to this illustrious convert, with a view of inciting him to attack
their common enemy the Saracens in one quarter, while he fell
upon them in the other. As monks were the only persons in
that age who possessed such a degree of knowledge as qualified
them for a service of this kind, he employed in it father
Andrew, a Jacobine, who was followed by father William de
Rubruquis, a Franciscan. With refpee to the progress of the
former, there is no memorial extant. The journal of the lat-
ter has been pullilhed. He was admitted into the presence of
Mangu, the third khan in succession from Zengis, and made a
circuit through the interior parts of Asia, more extensive then
that of any European who had hitherto explored them O

To those travellers, whom religious zeal sent forth to visit

Asia, succeeded others who ventured into remote countries,
from the profpea of commercial advantage, or from motives
of mere curiosity. The first and most eminent of these was
Marco Polo, a Venetian of a noble family. Having engaged iz6.
early in trade, according to the cuflom of his country, his afpir-
ing mind wished for a sphere of aivity more extensive than
was afforded to it by the established traffic carried on in those
ports of Europe and Asia, which the Venctians frequented.
This prompted him to travel into unknown countries, in expec-
tation of opening with them a commercial intercourfc, more
suited to the fanguinc ideas and hopes of a young adventurer.

B o0 o As his father had already carried some European commodities
A_,_« to the court of the great Chan of the Tartars, and had disposed

of them to advantage, he retorted thither. Under the protec-
tion of Kublay Chan, the most powerful of all the fucceolbrs of
Zengis, he continued his mercantile peregrinations in Asia up-
wards of twenty-fix years.; and during that time advanced to-
wards the east, far beyond the utmost boundaries to which any
European traveller had ever proceeded. Inflead of following
the course of Carpini and Rubruquis, along the vast unpeopled-
plains of Tartary, he pafled through the chief trading cities in
the more cultivated parts of Asia, and penetrated to Cambalu,
or Peking, the capital of the great kingdom. of Cathay, or Chi-
na, subject at-that time to the successors of Zengis. He made
more than one voyage on the Indian ocean, he traded in many
of the islands, from which Europe had long received fpiceries
and other commodities, which it held in high estimation, though
unacquainted with the particular countries to which it was in-
debted for those precious producions; and he obtained infor-
mation concerning several countries) which he did not visit
in person, particularly the island Zipangri, probably the fame
now known by the name of Japan . On his return, he
astonished his contemporaries with his descriptions of vail re-
gions, whose names had never been heard of in Europe, andt
with such pompous accounts of their fertility, their populous-
ness, their opulence, the variety of their manufactures, and.
the extent of their trade, as rose far above the conception. of an
uninformed age.

nmoft of the countries in the east which he had described, and, B 0 K.
like him, published an account of them on his return . The _-
narrations of those early travellers abound with many wild in-
coherent tales, concerning giants, enchanters, and monflers.
But they were not, from that circumRance, less acceptable to
an ignorant age, which delighted in what was marvellous.
The wonders which they told, mostly on hearsay, filled the
multitude with admiration. The faas which they related from
their own observation, attracted the attention of the more dif-
cerning. The former, which may be confidered as the popu-
lar traditions and fables of the countries through which they
had passed, were gradually disregarded as Europe advanced in
knowledge. The latter, however incredible ome of them
may have appeared in their own time, have been confirmed by
the observations of modern travellers. By means of both,
however, the curiosity of mankind was excited with refpe to
the remote parts of the earth, their ideas were enlarged, and
they were not only insensibly disposed to attempt new difcove-
ries, but received such information as directed to that particular
course in which there were afterwards carried on.

WHILE this spirit was gradually forming in Europe, a for- and by the

invention of

tunate discovery was made, which contributed more than all the mariners
the efforts and ingenuity of preceding ages, to improve and compa".
to extend navigation. That wonderful property of the mag-
net, by which it communicates such virtue to a needle or flen-
der rod of iron, as to point towards the poles of the earth,
was observed. The use which might be made of this in direct-
ing navigation was immediately perceived. Tlat most valu-
able, but now familiar instrument, the mariner.r copnafs, was

- _i/- seasons, and in every place, they could discover the north and

south with so much ease and accuracy, it became no longer
necefary to depend merely on. the light of the stars and the ob-
fcrvation of the sea coast. They gradually abandoned their,
ancient tinid and lingering course along the fiore, ventured
boldly into the ocean, and relying on this new guide, could.
fleer in the darkest night, and under the most cloudy sky,.
with a security and precision hitherto unknown. The compass
may be said to have opened to man the dominion of the sea,
and to have put him in full poffefion of the earth, by enabling
him to visit every part of it. Flavio Gioia, a citizen ofAmalli,.

the author of this great discovery, about. the year one thou-
sand three hundred and two. It hath been often the fate.
of those illtflrious benefadors of mankind, who. have en-

to derive more reputation than benefit. from the happy
efforts of their genius. But the lot of Gioia has been still
more cruel; through the inattention or ignorance of con-
temporary historians, he has been defrauded even of the fame
to which he had such a just title. We receive from them no
information with refpet to his profession,, his character, th-
precise time when he made this important discovery, or the
accidents and inquiries which led to it. The knowledge of this.

were accustomed, with greater security and expedition, its in- B 0 0 K
fluence was not so ufdden or extensive, as immediately to .-
render navigation adventurous, and to excite a spirit of dif-
covery. Many causes combined in preventing this beneficial
invention from producing its full effet inftanraneoufly. Men
rclinquifli ancient habits slowly, and with relucance. They
are averse to new experiments, and venture upon them with
timidity. The commercial jealousy of the Italians, it is pro-
babie, laboured to conceal the happy discovery of their coun-
tryman from other nations. The art of fleering by the com-
pals, with such kill and accuracy as to inspire a full confidence
in its direction, was acquired gradually. Sailors, unaccuf-
tomcd to quit fight of land, durst not launch out at once and
commit themselves to unknown eas. Accordingly, near half
a century elapsed, from the time of Gioia's discovery, before
navigators ventured into any seas which they had not been ac-.
customed to frequent.

By what accident they were led to the discovery of those finall in "avigation
isles, which lie near five hundred miles from the Spanish coast,
and above a hundred and fifty miles from the coast of Africa,
contemporary writers have not explained. But about the mid-
dle of the fourteenth ccntury, the people of all the different
kingdons into which Spain was then divided, were accuflomed
to make piratical excursions thither, in order to plunder the
inhabitants, or to carry them off as slaves. Clement VI. in
virtue of the right claimed by the holy fee to dilipofe of all
countries ponfefFed by infidels, creded those ifls into a
kingdom, in the year one thousand three hundred and
forty-four, and conferred it on Lewis de la Cerda, descended

from

B 0 0 K from the royal family of Castile. But that unfortunate

_-_-- prince, destitute of power to assert his nominal title, hav-

ing never visited the Canaries, John de Bethencourt, a Nor-
man baron, obtained a grant of them from Henry III. of
Castile'. Bethencourt, with the valour and good fortune
which diflinguifhed the adventurers of his country, attempted
and effected the conquest, and the pofeffion of the Canaries
remained for some time in his family, as a fief held of the
crown of Castile. Previous to this expedition of Bethencourt,
his countrymen are said to have visited the coast of Africa, and
1j65. to have proceeded far to the south of the Canary islands. But

their voyages thither seem not to have been undertaken in con-
sequence of any public or regular plan for extending navigation
and attempting new discoveries. They were either excursions
suggested by that roving piratical spirit, which descended to the
Normans from their ancestors, or the commercial enterprises of
private merchants, which attracted so little notice, that hardly
any memorial of them is to be found in contemporary authors.
In a general survey of the progress of discovery, it is sufficient
to have mentioned this event; and leaving it among those of
dubious existence, or of small importance, we may conclude,
that though much additional information concerning the remote
regions of the Eafl had been received by travellers who visited
them by larn, navigation, at the beginning of the fifteenth
century, had not advanced beyond the flatc to which it had
attained before the downfal of the Roman empire.

plvn of dif- men were to pass the limits within which they had been to long

confined, and open to themselves a more ample field wherein
to display their talents, their enterprise, and courage. The

first

first considerable efforts towards this were not made by any of B o0o K
the more powerful states of Europe, or by those who had ap- -
plied to navigation with the greatest assiduity and success.
The glory of leading the way in this new career was reserved
for Portugal, one of the smallest and most inconsiderable of the formed by the

['ortugllefc.

European kingdoms. As the attempts of the Portuguese to
acquire the knowledge of those parts of the globe with which
mankind were then unacquainted, not only improved and ex-
tended the art of navigation, but roused such a spirit of curio-
fity and enterprise, as led to the discovery of the New World of
which I propose to write the history, it is necessary to take a
view of the rife, the progress, and success of their various naval
operations. It was in this school that the discoverer of America
was trained ; and unless we trace the steps by which his in-
ftruaors and guides advanced, it will be impossible to compre-
hend the circumfiances which fuggefled the idea, or facilitated
the execution of his great design.

VARIOUS circumstances prompted the Portuguese to exert Circumlan-

ccs which led

their acivity in this new diretion,. and enabled them to ac- co hi.c
complifh undertakings apparently superior to the natural force
of their monarchy. The kings of Portugal, having driven the
Moors out of their dominions, had acquired power, as well as
glory, by the success of their arms against the infidels. By
their victories over them, they had extended the royal autho-
rity beyond the narrow limits within which it was originally
circumscribed in IPortugal, as well as in other feudal kingdoms.
They had the command of the national force, could rouse it to
ad with united vigour, and, after the expulsion of the Moors,
could employ it without dread of interruption from any domeflic
enemy. By the perpetual hostilities carried on for fcveral centuries

against

B 01 K against the Mahometans, the martial and adventurous fpir

-~ ^ which diflinguiflled all the European nations during the middle

ages, was improved and heightened among the Portuguese. A
fierce civil war, towards the close of the fourteenth century,
occasioned by a disputed fucceflion, augmented the military ar-
dour of the nation, and formed or called forth men of such
ative and daring genius, as are fit for bold undertakings.
The situation of the kingdom, bounded on every ide by the
dominions of a more powerful neighbour, did not afford free
fope to the acivity of the Portuguese by land, as the strength
of their monarchy was no match for that of Castile. But Por-
tugal was a maritime slate, in which there were many commo-
dious harbours; the people had begun to make some progress
in the knowledge and practice of navigation; and the sea was
open to theme, presenting the only field of enterprise in which
they could distinguish themselves.
*irRl attempt. SUCH was the slate of Portugal, and such the disposition of

the people, when JohnI. -surnamed the Baflard, obtained fe-
cure possession of the crown by the peace concluded with
Castile in the year one thousand four hundred and eleven.
He was a prince of great merit, who, by superior courage
and abilities, had opened his way to a throne which of
right did not belong to him. He inflantly perceived that
it would be impossible to prcfcrve public order, or domes-
tic tranquillity, without finding fme employment for the
refilcfs spirit of his flbjcas. With this view, he aflclmled
a numerous fleet at Lifion, conmpofcd of' all the flips that he
could fit out in his own kiingdoim, and of rmany hired from
foreigners. This great armament was defincd to attack the
4. Moors fettled on the coast of Barbary. Whilc it was equip-

ping, a few vcefels were appointed to fail along the western

fliore

shore of Africa bounded by the Atlantic ocean, and to discover B K
the unknown countries situated there. From this inconsiderable '----
attempt, we may date the commencement of that spirit of dif-
covery which opened the barriers that had so long shut out
mankind from the knowledge of one half of the terrestrial
globe.

AT the time when John ent forth these ships on this new

voyage, the art of navigation was still very imperfect. Though
Africa lay so near to Portugal, and the fertility of the coun-
tries already known on that continent invited men to explore
it more fully, the Portuguese had never ventured to fail
beyond Cape Non. That promontory, as its name imports,
was hitherto confidered as a boundary which could not be
passed. But the nations of Europe had now acquired as much
knowledge, as emboldened them to disregard the prejudices
and to correct the errors of their ancestors. The long reign of
ignorance, the conitant enemy of every curious inquiry, and
of every new undertaking, was approaching to its period. The
light of science began to dawn. The works of the ancient
Greeks and Romans began to be read with admiration and
profit. The fcicnces cultivated by the Arabians were intro-
duced into Europe by the Moors fettled in Spain and Portugal,
and by the Jews, who were very numerous in both tlicfc king-
doms. Geometry, aflronomy, and geography, the fcicnccs on
which the art of navigation is founded, became objcls of flu-
dious attention. Tile memory of the difcovcrics minde by the
ancients was revived, and the progress of their navigation and
commerce began to e traced. Some of the causes \hi:i,

Its rucces. As the genius of the age favoured the execution of that new

undertaking, to which the peculiar state of their country in-
vited the Portuguese, it proved successful. The vessels sent on
the discovery doubled that formidable Cape, which had ter-
minated the progress of former navigators, and proceeded a
hundred and sixty miles beyond it, to Cape Bojador. As its
rocky cliffs, which stretched a considerable way into the Atlan-
tic, appeared more dreadful than the promontory which they
had passed, the Portuguese commanders durst not attempt to.
fail round it, but returned to Lisbon, more satisfied with having-
advanced so far, than ashamed at having ventured no farther.

pushed it on to new undertakings. In order to render these
successful, it was necessary that they should be contluced by
a person who possessed abilities capable of discerning what
was attainable, who enjoyed leisure to form a regular system
for prosecuting discovery, and who was animated with ardour
that would persevere in spite of obstacles and repulses. Hap-

ibary, diftinguithed hirnfelf by many deeds of valour. To the B o O K
martial spirit, which was the characleriftic of every man of '_-
noble birth at that time, he added all the accomplishments of a
more enlightened and polished age. He cultivated the arts and
sciences, which were then unknown and despised by persons of
his rank. He applied with peculiar fondness to the study of
geography; and by the inftrudtion of able matiers, as well as
by the accounts of travellers, he early acquired such knowledge
of the habitable globe, as discovered the great probability of
finding new and opulent countries, by failing along the coast of
Africa. Such an objeCt was formed to awaken the enthusiasm
and ardour of a youthful mind, and he engaged with the ut-
molt zeal to patronize a design which might prove as beneficial,
as it appeared to be splendid and honourable. In order that he
might pursue this great scheme without interruption, he retired
from court immediately after his return from Africa, and fixed
his residence at Sagres, near Cape St. Vincent, where the pro-
fpeet of the Atlantic ocean invited his thoughts continually to-
wards his favourite projec, and encouraged him to execute it.
In this retreat he was attended by some of the most learned men
in his country, who aided him in his researches. He applied
for information to the Moors of Barbary, who were accustomed
to travel by land into the interior provinces of Africa, in
quest of ivory, gold-dull, and other rich commodities. He
consulted the Jews fettled in Portugal. By promises, rewards,
and marks of refpe&, he allured into his service several persons,
foreigners as well as Portugucfe, who were eminent for their
skill in navigation. In taking those preparatory iteps, the great
abilities of the prince were seconded by his private virtues. Hlia
integrity, his affability, his refpc fr religion, his zeal for
the honour of his country, engaged pcrfons of all ranks t(

the happiness of mankind, and which justly intitled him to

which he wished to be diftinguifled, the talent of doinggood.

single ship, and giving the command of it to John Gonzalez
Zarco and Triflan Vaz, two gentlemen of his household, who
voluntarily offered to conduc the enterprise, he infRruaed them
to use their utmost efforts to double Cape Bojador, and thence
to fleer towards the south. They, according to the mode of
navigation which fill prevailed, held their course along the
flore; and by following that direQion, they must have en-
countered almost insuperable difficulties in attempting to paTs
Cape Bojador. But fortune came in aid to their want of skill,
and prevented the voyage from being altogether fruitless.. A
sudden squall of wind arose, drove them out to sea, and when
they expetced every moment to perish, landed them on an
unknown island, which from their happy escape they named
Porto Santo. In the infancy of navigation, the difeovery of
this small island appeared a matter of such moment, that they
inflantly returlned to Portugal witl the good tidings, and were
received by H-enry with the applause and honour due to for-
tunate advcnturers. This faint dawn of fucccfs filled a mind
ardent in the pursuit of a favourite ol)jct with fucl sanguine
I-|iy hopes as were fuiicint incitements to procecd. Next year,

Hcnry sent out threc lips undecr the fLmne commanders, to

w llonn,

whom he joined Bartholomew Perefirello, in order to take pof- B 0 K
session of the iland which they had discovered. When they .-
began to fettle in Porto Santo, they observed towards the south
a fixed spot in the horizon, like a small black cloud. By de-
grees, they were led to conjeaure that it might be land, and of Madeira.
fieering towards it, they arrived at a considerable island, unin-
habited, and covered with wood, which on that account they
called Madwiira'. As it was Henry's chief objed to render his
discoveries useful to his country, lie immediately equipped a 1.2Z
fleet to carry a colony of Portuguese to these islands. By his
provident care, they were furnished not only with the feeds,
plants, and domefic animals common in Europe; but as lie
foresaw that the warmth of the climate and fertility of the foil
would prove favourable to the rearing of other productions, he
procured flips of the vine from the island of Cyprus, the rich
wines of which were then in great rcqucit, and plants of the
sugar-cane from Sicily, into which it had been lately introduced.
These throve so prosperously in this new country, that the
benefit of cultivating them was immediately perceived, and the
sugar and wine of Madeira quickly became considerable articles.

1433. This successful voyage, which the ignorance of the age placed

on a level with the mofl famous exploits recorded in history,
opened a new sphere to navigation, as it discovered the valf
continent of Africa, fill waffed by the Atlantic ocean, and
stretching towards the south. Part of this was oon explored

Afonifhedat HITHERTO the Portuguese had been guided in their dif-
what they di-
covered there. coveries, or encouraged to attempt them, by the light and

information which they received from the works of the ancient
mathematicians and geographers. But, when they began to
enter the torrid zone, the notion which prevailed among
the ancients, that the heat, which reigned perpetually there,
was so excessive as to render it uninhabitable, deterred them
for ome time, from proceeding. Their own observations,
when they first ventured into this unknown and formidable
region, tended to confirm the opinion of antiquity concern-
ing the violent operation of the direct rays of the fun. As
far as the river Senegal, the Portuguese had found the coast
of Africa inhabited by people nearly resembling the Moors of
Barbary. When they advanced to the south of that river, the
human form seemed to put on a new appearance. They be-
held men with fikins black as ebony, with hort curled hair,
flat notes, thick lips, and all the peculiar features which are
now known to diltinguifh the race of negroes. This fur-
prifing alteration they naturally attiibuted to the influence of

heat, and if they hould advance nearer to the line, they began B O O K
to dread that its effecEs would be frill more violent. Those dan- _,--
gers were exaggerated, and many other objecions againfl
attempting farther discoveries were proposed by some of the
grandees, who, from ignorance, from envy, or from that cold
timid prudence which rejects whatever has the air of novelty
or enterprise, had hitherto condemned all prince Henry's
schemes. They represented, that it was altogether chimerical
to expect any advantage from countries situated in that region
which the wisdom and experience of antiquity had pronounced
to be unfit for the habitation of men; that their forefathers,
satisfied with cultivating the territory which Providence had
allotted them, did not waste the strength of the kingdom by
fruitless projects, in quest of new settlements; that Portugal
was already exhausted by the expence of attempts to discover
lands which either did not exist, or which nature deflined to
remain unknown; and was drained of men, who might have
been employed in undertakings attended with more certain fuc-
cess, and productive of greater benefit. But neither their appeal
to the authority of the ancients, nor their reasonings concerning
the interest of Portugal, made any impression upon the deter-
mined philosophic mind of prince Henry. The discoveries
which he had already made convinced him that the ancients
had little more than a conjectural knowledge of the torrid zone..
I-e was no less satisfied that the political arguments of his op-
ponents with refpec to the interest of Portugal were malevolent
and ill-founded. In tlofe sentiments he was llrenuoufly sup-
ported by his brother Pedro, who governed the kingdom as
guardian of their nephew Alphonfo V. who had ficceeded to

Pope, and representcd, in pompous terms, the pious and un-
wearied zeal, with which he had exerted himself during twenty
years, in discovering unknown countries, the wretched inha-
bitants of which were utter firangers to true religion, wander-
ing in heathen darkness, or led astray by the delusions of Ma-
homet. He besought the holy father, to whom, as the vicar
of Christ, all the kingdoms of the earth were subjec, to con-
ser on the crown of Portugal a right to all the countries possessed
by Infidels, which should be discovered by the industry of its
subjects, and subdued by the force of its arms. He intreated
him to enjoin all Christian powers, under the highest penalties,
not to molest the Portuguese while engaged in this laudable
enterprise, and to prohibit them from fettling in any of the
countries which they flould discover. He promised that, in
all their expeditions, it hould be the chief objec: of the Por-
tuguefe to spread the knowledge of the Chriflian religion, to
eflablifl the authority of the holy fee, and to increase the flock
of the universal pastor. As it was by improving with dexte-
rity every favourable conjuncturc for acquiring new powers,
that the court of Rome had gradually extended its ufirpoations,
Eugene IV. the pontiff to whom this application was made,
eagerly seized the opportunity which now presentcd itself. Ile
inflantly perceived, that by complying with prince H-enry's
arcqucft, he might cxcrcife a prerogative no les lattering in is

9 own

own nature, than likely to prove beneficial in its consequences. B 0 K
A Bull was accordingly issued, in which, after applauding in
the strongest terms the past efforts of the Portuguese, and ex-
horting them to proceed in that laudable career on which they
had entered, he granted them an exclusive right to all the coun-
tries which they should discover, from Cape Non to the conti-
nent of India.

EXTRAVAGANT as this donation, comprehending such a

large portion of the habitable globe, would now appear even in
Catholic countries, no person in the fifteenth century doubted
that the pope, in the plenitude of his apostolic power, had a
right to confer it. Prince Henry was oon sensible of the ad-
vantages which he derived from this tranfadion. His schemes
were authorised and fanaified by the bull approving of them.
The spirit of discovery was conneced with zeal for religion,
which, in that age, was a principle of filch aCtivity and vigour,
as to influence the conduEt of nations. All Christian princes
were deterred from intruding into those countries which the
Portuguese had discovered, or from interrupting the progress
of their navigation and conquests x.

THE fame of the Portuguese voyages soon spread over Eu- Famc and

knowledge of the human mind within the limits to which they g'er'tfiro-
had been hitherto confined, were aflonified to behold the
fpliere of navigation so suddenly enlarged, and a profpcec
opened of visiting regions of the globe, the exiflence of which
was unknown in former times. The learned and speculative
realbned ad formed theories concerning those unexpected
discoveries. The vulgar inquired and wondered; while enter-

-v_-'.. liciting prince Henry to employ them in this honourable service.

Many Venetians and Genoese, in particular, who were, at that
time, superior to all other nations in the science of naval affairs,
entered aboard the Portuguese hips, and acquired a more per-
seQ: and extensive knowledge of their profeflion in that new
school of navigation. In emulation of these foreigners, the
Portuguese exerted their own talents. The nation seconded
the designs of the prince. Private merchants formed compa-
1446. nies, with a view to search for unknown countries. The Cape

de Verd islands, which lie off the promontory of that name,
1449. were discovered, and soon after, the ifies called Azores. As

the former of these are above three hundred miles from the
African coat, and the latter nine hundred miles from any con-
tinent, it is evident, by their venturing so boldly into the open
'eas, that the Portuguese had, by this time, improved greatly
in the art of navigation.

Death of WHILE the paftion for engaging in new undertakings was
enry. thus warm and aive, it received an unfortunate check by the

1463. death of prince Henry, whose superior knowledge had hitherto

directed all the operations of the difcovercrs, and whose patro-
nage had encouraged and proteced them. But notwithftand-
ing all the advantages which they derived from these, the Portu-
guefe, during his life, did not advance, in their utmost progress
towards the south, within five degrees of the equinotial line;
and, after their continued exertions for half a century, hardly
fifteen hundred miles of the coafl of Africa were discovered.
To an age acquainted with the efforts of navigation in its

the conduct of them to Fernando Gomez, a merchant in Lisbon,
to whom he granted an exclusive right of commerce with all
the countries of which prince Henry had taken poffeflion. Un-
der the reitraint and oppreiflon of a monopoly, the spirit of
discovery languished. It ceased to be a national object, and be-
came the concern of a private man, more attentive to his own
gain, than to the glory of his country. Some progress, however,
was made. The Portuguese ventured at length to cross the 147t.
line, and, to their aflonifhment, found that region of the torrid
zone, which was supposed to be scorched with intolerable heat,
to be not only habitable, but populous and fertile.

turned his attention towards them, and altisfied him with re-

appeared to be of greater conllqucnlcc. While the Portuguese
proceeded along the coast of Africa, from Cape Non to the

the Mahometan religion, and fubjeEt to the vast empire of Mo-
rocco. But to the south of that river, the power and religion
of the Mahometans were unknown. The country was divided
into small independent principalities, the population was confi-
derable, the foil fertile Y, and the Portuguese soon discovered
that it produced ivory, rich gums, gold, and other valuable
commodities. By the acquisition of these, commerce was en-
larged, and became more adventurous. Men, animated and
rendered active by the certain profped of gain, pursued disco-
very with greater eagerness, than when they were excited only
by curiosity and hope.

the countenance of such a monarch as John. Declaring
himself the patron of every attempt towards discovery, he
promoted it with all the ardour of his grand-uncle prince
1484. Henry, and with superior power. The effects of this were

immediately felt. A powerful fleet was fitted out, which,
after discovering the kingdoms of Benin and Congo, ad-
vanced above fifteen hundred miles beyond the line, and
the Portuguese, for the first time, beheld a new heaven, and
observed the stars of another hemisphere. John was not only
solicitous to discover, but attentive to secure the pofleffion of
those countries. He built forts on the coast of Guinea; he
fcnt out colonies to fettle there; he eflablifhed a commercial
intercourse with the more powerful kingdoms; he cndeavoured

to render such as were feeble or divided, tributary to the crown B 0O K
of Portugal. Some of the petty princes voluntarily acknow- '---
ledged theinfllves his vassals. Others were compelled to do so
by force of arms. A regular and well digefled fyltem was
formed with refpet to this new objet of policy, and by firmly
adhering to it, the Portuguese power and commerce in Africa
were established upon a solid foundation.

Portuguese gradually acquired ome knowledge of those parts newv route to

of that country which they had not visited. The information iies.
which they received from the natives, added to what they had
observed in their own voyages, began to open profpe&s more ex-
tensive, and to suggest the idea of schemes more important, than
thole which had hitherto allured and occupied them. They
had detected the error of the ancients concerning the nature of
the torrid zone. They found, as they proceeded southwards,
that the continent of Africa, instead of extending in breadth,
according to the doctrine of Ptolemy , at that time the oracle
and guide of the learned in the study of geography, appeared
fcnfibly to contract itlelf, and to )bend towards the east. This
induced them to give credit to the accounts of the ancient I'hc-
nician voyages round Africa, which had long been deemed fa-
bulous, and led them to conceive hopes lhat by f5llowing the

arduous and important voyage.

Schemes fr BEFORE his preparations for this expedition were finished,.
accomplish-
ing this. accounts were transmitted from Africa, that various nations

along the coaPt had mentioned a mighty kingdom situated on
their continent, at a great distance towards the east, the king
of which, according to their description, professed the Christian
religion. The Portuguese monarch immediately concluded, that
this must be the emperor of Abyssinia, to whom the Europeans,
seduced by a mistake of Rubruquis, Marco Polo, and other tra-
vellers to the east, absurdly gave the name Prester or Presbyter
John; and as he hoped to receive information and assistance
from a Christian prince, in prosecuting a scheme that tended to
propagate their common faith, he resolved to open, if possible,
some intercourse with his court. With this view, he made
choice of Pedro de Covillam and Alphonfo de Payva, who were
perfect maflers of the Arabic language, and sent them into
the east, to search for the residence of this unknown potentate,
and to make him proffers of friendship. They had it in charge,
likewise, to procure whatever intelligence the nations which
they visited could supply, with refpe& to the trade of India,
and the course of navigation to that continent .

pericnce, and fortitude rendered him equal to the undertaking.
He firetched boldly towards the south, and proceeding beyond 1486.
the utmost limits to which his countrymen had hitherto advanc--
ed, discovered near a thousand miles of new country. Neither
the danger to which he was exposed, by a succession of violent
tempests in unknown seas, and by the frequent mutinies of his
crew, nor the calamities of famine which he suffered from los-
ing his store-ship, could deter him from prosecuting his enter-
prise. In recompence of his labours and perseverance, he at
lafi descried that lofty promontory which bounds Africa to the
south. But to descry it, was all that was in his power. The
violence of the winds, the flhattered condition of his hips, and
the turbulent spirit of his sailors, compelled him to return,
after a voyage of sixteen months, in which he discovered a
far greater extent of country than any former naviga'or.
Diaz had called the promontory which terminated his voyage
Cabo Tormentofo, or the flormy Cape; but the king, his mafler,
as he now entertained no doubt of having found the long de-
fired route to India, gave it a name more inviting, and of bet-
ter omen, The Cape of Good Hjpe b.

which Payva and he had fixed upon as their place of rendez-
vous. Unfortunately the former was cruelly murdered in
Abyflinia, but Covillam found at Cairo two Portuguese Jews,
whom John, whose provident sagacity attended to every cir-
cumftance that could facilitate the execution of his schemes,
had dispatched after them, in order to receive a detail of their
proceedings, and to communicate to them new inftrudions.
By one of these Jews, Covillam tranfnitted to Portugal a jour-
nal of his travels by ea and land, his remarks upon the trade
of India, together with exa&t maps of the coasts on which he
had touched; and from what he himself had observed, as well
as from the information of skilful seamen in different countries,
he concluded, that by failing round Africa, a pafiage might be
found to th'e East Indies .

'Preparations THE happy coincidence of Covillam's opinion and report,
for another
achage. with the discoveries which Diaz had lately made, left hardly

any hadow of doubt with respect to the possibility of failing
fiom Europe to India. But the vast length of the voyage, and
the furious storms which Iiaz had encountered near the Cape
of Good Hope, alarmed and intimidated the Portuguese to
such a degree, although by long experience they were now be-
.come adventurous and fkilftil mariners, that ome time was
requifitc to prepare their minds for this dangerous and extra-
ordinary voyage. The courage, however, and authority of
the monarch, gradually dlilcllcd the vain fears of his fuljeets,
or made it neceflary to conceal them. As John thought himself

t_ ,- plied with such ardour and predilection, on account of their

conneaion with navigation, his favourite object, that he ad-
vanced with rapid proficiency in the fludy of them. Thus
,l6i. qualified, he went to sea at the age of fourteen, and began his

career on that element which conduted him to o much glory.
His early voyages were to those ports in the Mediterranean
which his countrymen the Genoese frequented. This being a
1467. sphere too narrow for his ative mind, he made an excursion to

the northern seas, and visited the coasts of Iceland, to which
the Englill and other nations had begun to resort on account
of its fiihery. As navigation, in every direction, was now
become enterprising, he proceeded beyond that island, the
Thule of the ancients, and advanced several degrees within the
polar circle. Having satisficd his curiosity by a voyage which
tended more to enlarge his knowledge of naval affairs, than to
improve his fortune, he entered into the service of a famous
fea-captain, of his own name and family. This man com-
manded a small squadron, fitted out at his own expence, and
by cruising sometimes against the Mahometans, sometimes
against the Venetians, the rivals of his country in trade, had
acquired both wealth and reputation. With him Columbus
continued for several years, no les diflinguilled for his cou-
rage, than for his experience as a sailor. At length, in an
obilinate engagement, off the coast of Portugal, with some
Venetian caravels, returning riclily laden from the Low Coun-
tries, the veisel on board which he served took lire, together
with one of tle enemy's fliips, to which it was fall grappled.
In this dreadful extremity his intrepidity and presence of mind
did not forsake him. He threw himelf into the sea, laid hold
of a floating oar, and by the support of it, and his dexterity ill

soon conceived such a favourable opinion of his merit, as well
as talents, that they warmly solicited him to remain in that
kingdom, where his naval kill and experience could not fail of
rendering himn conspicuous. To every adventurer, animated
either with curioiity to visit new countries, or with ambition to
distinguish himself, the Portuguese service was at that time e-
tremely inviting. Columbus liflened with a favourable car to
the advice of his friends, and having gained the cftecm of a
Portuguese lady, whom he married, fixed his refidcnce in
Lisbon. This alliance, instead of detaching him from a fca-
faring life, contributed to enlarge the sphere of his naval know-
ledge, and to excite a desire of extending it fiill farther. His
wife was a daughter of Bartholomew Pereftrello, one of the
captains employed by prince Henry in his early navigations,
and who, under his protection, had discovered and planted the
islands of Porto Santo and Madeira. Columbus got pofleoll
of the journals and charts of this experienced navigator, and
from them he learned the course which the PIortuuefc liad held

The cffeasof By the experience which Columbus acquired, during such a
their dico-
veries uon variety of voyages to almofl every part of the globe with which,

at that time, any intercourse was carried on by fca, he was now
become one of the most skilful navigators in Europe. But, not
satisfied with that praise, his ambition aimed at something
more. The successful progress of the Portuguese navigators had
awakened a spirit of curiosity and emulation, which set every
man of science upon examining all the circumstances that led to
the discoveries which they had made, or that afforded a profped
of succeeding in any new and bolder undertaking. The mind
of Columbus, naturally inquisitive, capable of deep reflection,
and turned to peculations of this kind, was so often employed
in revolving the principles upon which the Portuguese had
founded their schemes of discovery, and the mode in which
they had carried them on, that he gradually began to form an
idea of improving upon their plan, and of accomplifling dif-
coveries which hitherto they had attempted in vain.

1ridea fa n"c obje& in view at that period. Froml the time that the Portu-

aimed in all their navigations, and, in comparison with it, all
their discoveries in Africa appeared inconfiderablc. The ser-
tility and riches of India had been known for many ages; its
fpiccs and other valuable commodities were in high rcqueft
throughout Europe, and the val: wealth of the Venetians

arising from their having engrossed this trade, had raised the B 10 1
envy of all nations. ut how intent soever the Portuguese
were upon discovering a new route to those desirable regions,
they searched for it only by steering towards the south, in hopes
of arriving at India, by turning to the east, after they had
failed round the farther extremity of Africa. This course
was still unknown, and, even if discovered, was of such im-
mense length, that a voyage from Europe to India mut have
appeared an undertaking extremely arduous, and of very un-
certain ifue. More than half a century had been employed
in advancing from Cape Non to the equator; a much longer
space of time might elapse before the more extensive navigation
from that to India could be accompliflhed. These rcfleclions
upon the uncertainty, the danger and tedioufncfs of the course
which the Portuguese were pursuing, naturally led Columbus
to confider whether a shorter and more dire- passage to the
East Indies might not be found out. And, after revolving long
and seriously every circumstance fuggefled by his superior know-
ledge in the theory as well as practice of navigation, after com-
paring attentively the obfcrvations of modern pilots with the
hints and conjctures of antient authors, he at last concluded,
that by failing dire&ly towards the weft, across the Atlantic
ocean, new countries, which probably formed a part of the
vast continent of India, nmuf infallibly be discovered.

..-- suitable to our ideas concerning the wisdom and beneficence of

the Author of Nature, to believe that the vast space, fiill unex-
plored, was not covered entirely by a waste unprofitable ocean,
but occupied by countries fit for the habitation of man. It
appeared likewise extremely probable, that the continent, on
this fide of the globe, was balanced by a proportional quantity
of land in the other hemisphere. These conclusions concerning
the exiilcnce of another continent, drawn from the figure and
flruiture of the globe, were confirmed by the observations and
conjcdurcs of modern navigators. A Portuguese pilot, having
stretched farther to the weft than was usual at that time, took
up a piece of timber artificially carved, floating upon the sea;
and as it was driven towards him by a westerly wind, he con-
cluded that it came from ome unknown land, situated in that
quarter. Columbus's brother-in-law had found, to the weft of
the Madeira iflcs, a piece of timber fashioned in the fame man-
ner, and brought by the fame wind; and had fcen likewise
canes of an enormous size floating upon the waves, which re-
fembled those described by Ptolemy as productions peculiar to
the East Indies . After a course of westerly winds, trees, torn
up by the roots, were often driven upon the coafis of the A-
zorcs, and at one time the dead bodies of two men, with singular
features, resembling neither the inhabitants of Europe nor of
Africa, were cast aflore there.

As the force of this united evidence, arising fiom theoretical

princlples and pracical obfcrvations, led Columbus to expc
the diicovcry of new countries in the We'cern Ocean, other

with the continent of India. Though the ancients had hardly B OO KI
ever penetrated into India farther than the banks of the ---
Ganges, yet ome Greek authors had ventured to describe the
provinces beyond that river. As men are prone, and at li-
berty, to magnify what is remote or unknown, they repre-
sented them as regions of an immense extent. Ctefias affirmed
that India was as large as all the reft of Asia. Oneficritus,
whom Pliny the naturalist follows', contended that it was equal
to a third part of the habitable earth. Nearchus asserted, that
it would take four months to march in a straight line from one
extremity of it to the other '. The journal of Marco Polo, who
had proceeded towards the East far beyond the limits to which
any European had ever advanced, seemed to confirm these exag-
gerated accounts of the ancients. By his magnificent descriptions
of the kingdoms of Cathay and Cipango, and of many other
countries, the names of which were unknown in Europe, India
appeared to be a region of valf extent. From these accounts,
which, however defeCtive, were the most accurate that the people
of Europe had at that period received, with refpet to the remote
parts of the East, Columbus drew a just conclusion. -Ie con-
tended, that, in proportion as the continent of India stretched out
towards the East, it mufl, in consequence of the spherical figure
of the earth, approach nearer, to the islands which had lately
been discovered to the weft of Africa; that the diflance from
the one to the other was probably not very considerable; and
that the most direct, as well as shortest course, to the remote
regions of the East, was to be found by failing due weft6.

B 011o0 This notion concerning the vicinity of India to the western
-.- -- parts of our ctinent, was countenanced by some eminent

writers among the ancients, the fandion of whose authority
was neceflary, in that age, to procure a favourable reception to
any tenet. Aristotle thought it probable that the Columns of
I-ercules, or Straits of Gibraltar, were not far removed from
the East Indies, and that there might be a communication by
sea between them h. Seneca, in terms frill more explicit,
affirms, that, with a fair wind, one might fail from Spain to
India in a few days '. The famous Atlantic island described
by Plato, which many supposed to be a real country, beyond*
which a vafl unknown continent was situated, is represented by
him as lying at no great distance from Spain. After weighing
all there particulars, Columbus, in whose character the modefly
and diffidence of true genius was united with the ardent en-
thufiafm'tf a projector, did not reft with such absolute assurance
either upon his own arguments, or upon the authority of the
ancients, as not to consult such of his contemporaries as were
capable of comprehending the nature of the evidence which he
produced in support of his opinion. As early as the year one
thousand four hundred and feventy-four, he communicated his
ideas concerning the probability of discovering new countries,
by failing westwards, to Paul, a physician of Florence, emi-
nent for his knowledge of cosmography, and who, from the
learning as well as candour which he discovers in his reply,
appears to have been well intitled to the confidence which
Columbus placed in him. He warmly approved of the plan,
iuggefled several facts in confirmation of it, and encouraged
Columbus to persevere in an undertaking so laudable, and-

To a mind less capable of forming and of executing great His schemes

designs than that of Columbus, all those reasonings, and obfer- into execu-
vations, and authorities, would have served only as the foun- tion.
dation of some plausible and fruitless theory, which might have
furnished matter for ingenious discourse, or fanciful conjecture.
But with his sanguine and enterprising temper, speculation led
directly to aion. Fully satisfied himself with refpea to the
truth of his system, he was impatient to bring it to the tef of
experiment, and to set out upon a voyage of discovery. The
first flep towards this was to secure the patronage of some of
the considerable powers in Europe, capable of undertaking
such an enterprise. As long absence had not extinguished the
affetion which he bore to his native country, he wished that it
should reap the fruits of his labours and invention. With this
view, he laid his scheme before the senate of Genoa, and making He applies to
his country the first tender of his service, offered to fail under
the banners of the republic, in quest of the new regions which
he expected to discover. But Columbus had resided for so many
years in foreign parts, that his countrymen were unacquainted
with his abilities and character ; and, though a maritime people,
they were so little accustomed to diflant voyages, that they
could form no just idea of the principles on which he founded
his hopes of success. They inconsiderately rejeced his pro-
pofal, as the dream of a chimerical projetor, and loft for ever
the opportunity of restoring their commonwealth to its ancient
splendour'.

B r0 Kc HAVING performed what was due to his country, Columbua
..-,-- was so little discouraged by the repulse which he had received,
to the king of
Portugal; that, instead of relinquishing his undertaking, he pursucd it

with freff ardour. He made his next overture to John II.
king of Portugal, in whofc dominions he had been long cela-
blilhed, and whom he confidered, on that account, as having
the second claim to his service. Here every circuiniance seem-
ed to promise him a more favourable reception. He applied to
a monarch of an enterprising genius, no incompetent judge in
naval affairs, and proud of patronising every attempt to disco-
ver new countries. His filbjeas were the most experienced
navigators in Europe, and the least apt to be intimidated either
by the novelty or boldness of any maritime expedition. In
Portugal, Columbus's kill in his profefion, -as well as his pcr-
fonal good qualities, were thoroughly known; and as the
former rendered it probable that his scheme was not altogether
chimerical, the latter exempted him from the suspicion of any
sinister intention in proposing it. Accordingly, the king
listened to him. in the moft.gracious manner, and: referred the
consideration of his plan to Diego Ortiz, biliop.of Ceuta,. and
two Jewi-lh physicians, eminent cosmographers, whom he was
accultomed to consult in matters of this kind. As in Genoa,
ignorance had opposed and disappointed Columbus; in Lisbon,
he had to combat with prejudice, an enemy no less formidablc.
The persons, according to whose decision his scheme was to be
adopted or rejeded, had been the chief directors of the Portu-
guefe navigations, and had advised to fcarch. for a paflige to
India, by rteering a course diretly opposite to that which Co-
lumbus recommended as fhortcr and more certain. They could
not, thercforc, approve of his proposal, without submitting to
the double mortification, of condcmning their own theory,

and of acknowledging his superior sagacity. After tcafing B 0O K

explanation of his system, as might draw from him a full dil-

with rcfpea to it. In the mean time, they conspired to rob
him of the honour and advantages which he expeacd fiom the
success of his scheme, advising the king o dispatch a veffil,
secretly, in order to attempt the proposed discovery, by follow-
ing cxacly the course which Columbus seemed to point out.
John, forgetting on this occasion the sentiments becoming a
monarch, meanly adopted this perfidious counsel. But tle
pilot, chosen to execute Columbus's plan, had neither the ge-
nius, nor the fortitude of its author. Contrary winds arose,
no fight of approaching land appeared, his courage failed, and

propose it in person, to Ferdinand and Isabella, who at that
time governed the united kingdoms of Caltile and Aragon.

B 0 K cations to kings and ministers, he took the precaution of fend-
L--- ing into England his brother Bartholomew, to whom he had

fully communicated his ideas, in order that he might negociate,
at the fame time, with Henry VII. who was reputed one of
the most sagacious as well as opulent princes in Europe.

Obilacles to IT was not without reason that Columbus entertained doubts
his fucccf in
Spain. and fears with refpel to the reception of his proposals in the

Spanish court. Spain was, at that jundure, engaged in a dan-
gerous war with Granada, the last of the Moorish kingdoms.
The wary and suspicious temper of Ferdinand was not formed
to relish bold and uncommon designs. Isabella, though more
generous and enterprising, was under the influence of her hus-
band in all her ations. The Spaniards had hitherto made no
efforts to extend navigation beyond its ancient limits, and had
beheld tie amazing progress of discovery among their neigh-
bours the Portuguese, without one attempt to imitate or to
rival them. The war with the Infidels afforded an ample field
to the national aivity and love of glory. Under circumfiances
so unfavourable, it was impossible for Columbus to make rapid
progress with a nation, naturally flow and dilatory in forming
all its resolutions. His charaaer, however, was admirably
adapted to that of the people, whose confidence and protecion
he solicited. He was grave, though courteous in his deport-
ment; circumfpea in his words and actions; irreproachable in
his morals; and exemplary in his attention to all the duties
and funCions of religion. By qualities so respectable, he not
only gained many private friends, but acquired such general
Rteern, that, notwithstanding the plainness of his appearance,
suitable to the mediocrity of his fortune, he was not confidered
as a mere adventurer, to whom indigence had fuggefled a vifi-

onary

onary project, but was received as a person to whose propofi- B 0 0 K
tions serious attention was due. ---_

FERDINAND and Isabella, though fully occupied by their His scheme

examined by

operations againfi the Moors, paid so much regard to Colum- unfkiltul
bus, as to remit the consideration of his plan to the queen's judges,
confessor, Ferdinand de Talavera. He consulted such of his
countrymen, as were supposed belt qualified to decide with re-
sped to a subjed of this kind. But true science had, hitherto,
made so little progress in Spain, that those pretended philofo-
phers, feleded to judge in a matter of such moment, did not
comprehend the first principles, upon which Columbus founded
his conjectures and hopes. Some of them, from mistaken no-
tions concerning the dimensions of the globe, contended that a
voyage to those remote parts of the east, which Columbus ex-
peaed to discover, could not be performed in less than three
years. Others concluded, that either he would find the ocean
to be of infinite extent, according to the opinion of ome an-
cient philosophers; or, if he should persist in fleering towards
the weft beyond a certain point, that the convex figure of the
globe would prevent his return, and that he must inevitably
perish, in the vain attempt, to open a communication between
the two opposite hemispheres, which nature had for ever dif-
joined. Even without deigning to enter into any particular
discussion, ome rejected the fchcme in general, upon the credit
of a maxim, under which the ignorant and unenterprifing
flelter themselves in every age, " That it is presumptuous in
any perobn, to suppose that he alone poifeffes knowledge fu-
perior to all the reft of mankind united." They maintained,
that if there were really any such countries as Columbus
pretended, they could not have remained so long concealed,

who rmiake n IT required all Columbus's patience and address to negociate
unfavourable
relot cn. with men capable of advancing such strange propositions. He
cerningit. had to contend not only with the obstinacy of ignorance, but

with what is lill more intractable, the pride of false know-
ledge. After innumerable conferences, and wafting five years
in fruitless endeavours to inform and to satisfy judges so little
capable of deciding with propriety, Talavera, at last, made
such an unfavourable report to Ferdinand and Isabella, as in-
duced them to acquaint Columbus, that until the war with the
Moors .hould be brought to a period, it would be imprudent to
engage in any new and.expenfive enterprise.

WHATEVER care was taken to soften the *harshness of this

declaration, Columbus confidered it as a final rejedcion of his
proposals. But happily for mankind, that superiority of ge-
nius, which is capable of forming great and uncommon de-
signs, is usually accompanied with an ardent enthufiain, which
can neither be cooled by delays, nor damped by disappointment.
Columbus was of this sanguine temper. Though he felt
deeply the cruel blow given to his hopes, and retired immedi-
ately from a court, where he had been amused so long with
vain expectations, his confidence in thejuflnefsof his own system
did not diminiflh, and his impatience to demonstrate the truth
of it by an acdual experiment became greater than ever. Hav-
ing courted the protecion of sovereign fates without success,
he applied, next, to persons of inferior rank, and addressed
s;uccessively the dukes of Medina Sidonja, and Mcdina Celi,
who, though fTuljccs, were p1offefeed of power and opulence

more

more than equal to the enterprise which he projeced. His B 0 K
negociations with them proved as fruitless, as those in which .
he had been hitherto engaged; for these noblemen were either
as little convinced by Columbus's arguments as their superiors,
or they were afraid of alarming the jealousy, and offending the
pride of Ferdinand, by countenancing a scheme, which he had
rejeced ".

AMID the painful sensations occasioned by such a filccef- Negociation

distress, of having received no accounts of his brother, whom
he had sent to 'the court of England. In his voyage to that
country, Bartholomew had been so unfortunate as to fall into
the hands of pirates, who having firipped him of every thing,
detained him a prisoner for several years. At length, he made
his escape, and arrived in London, but in such extreme indi-
gence, that he was obliged to employ himself during a confi-
derable time, in drawing and felling maps, in order to pick up
as much money as would purchase a decent dress, in which he
might venture to appear at court. He then laid before the
king the proposals, with which he had been entrusted by his
brother, and, notwithstanding Henry's excessive caution and
parsimony, which rendered him avcrfc to new and expensive
undertakings, he received Columbus's overtures, with more
approbation, than any monarch to whom they had hitherto
been presented.

had already made preparations for this purpose, and taken
measures for the disposal of his children during his absence,
when Juan Perez, the guardian of the monafiery of Rabid-a,
near Palos, in which they had een educated, earnefHly solicited
him to defer is journey for a ihort time. Percz was a man of
considerable learning, and of some credit with Queen Isabella,
to whom he was known personally. He was warmly attached
to Columbus, with whole abilities as well as integrity lie had
many opportunities of being acquainted. Prompted by curio-
fity or by friendlhip, lie entered upon an accurate examination
of his sysem, in conjundion with a physician fettled in the
neighbourhood, who was a considerable proficient in matheina-
tical knowledge. This investigation satisfied them so tho-
roughly, with refpeat to the solidity of the principles on
which Columbus ounded his opinion, and the probability of
success in executing the plan which he proposed, that Percz, in
order to prevent his country from being deprived of the glory
and benefit, which must accrue to the patrons of fucli a grand
enterprise, ventured to write to fabclla, conjuring lier to con-
fidcr the matter anew, with the attention which it meritcd.

MOVED by the repreientations of a person \whom efie re-

spectcd, Iabella desired Pcrcz to repair immeci:ltely to the vil-
lage of Santa P;, in which, on account of the liege of Cra-
nada, the court resided at that time, that llie might confer willt
him upon tllis important fulljct. Thle fl: clftc1: ot their in-
terview was a gracious invitation of Columnbus backl to court,
accompanied with thc prcflent of a 'in all finii to c!.;, ,iil for
the journey. As there was now a certain piollUcCt, tl:at the

vwar with the Moors would speedily be brought to an happy B 0O K
ifTue by the reducaion of Granada, which would leave the na-
tion at liberty to engage in new undertakings ; this, as well as
the mark of royal favour, with which Columbus had been
lately honoured, encouraged his friends to appear with greater
confidence than formerly in support of his scheme. The chief
of these, Alonfo de Quintanilla, comptroller of the finances in
Castile, and Luis de Santangel, receiver of the ecclesiastical
revenues in Aragon, whose meritorious zeal in promoting this
great deLign, entitles their names to an honourable place in
history, introduced Columbus to many persons of high rank,
and interested them warmly in his behalf.

BUT it was not an easy matter to inspire Ferdinand with Is againdif-

favourable sentiments. He frill regarded Columbus's project
as extravagant and chimerical, and in order to render the efforts
of his partizans ineffecual, lie had the address to employ in
this new negociation with him, some of the persons who had
formerly pronounced his scheme to be impracticable. To their
astonishment, Columbus appeared before them with the fame
confident hopes of success as formerly, and insistcd upon the
fame high recompence. He proposed that a fimall fleet should
be fitted out, under his command, to attempt the discovery,
and demanded to be appointed hereditary admiral and viceroy
of all the seas and lands which lie flould dicovcr, and to have
the tenth of the profits arising fiom them, fettled irrcvocably
upon himself and his defccndants. At the fame time, lie
offered to advance the eighth part of the ifu ncccflhry for
accomplishing his dcfign, on condition that lie fliould be cn-

this conduc as the clearest evidence of his full persuasion with.
cefpct to the truth of his own fyflem, or being struck with that
magnanimity, which, after.fo many delays and repulses, would
sloop to nothing inferior to its original claims, the persons with
whom Columbus treated, began meanly to calculate the ex-
pence of the expedition, and the value of the reward which he
demanded. The expence, moderate as it was, they repre-
sented to be too great for Spain, in the present exhausted state
of its finances. They contended, that the honours and emo-
luments claimed by Columbus, were exorbitant, even if he
should perform the utmost of what he had promised; and if all
his sanguine hopes should prove illusive, such vast concessions
to an adventurer would be deemed not only inconsiderate, but
ridiculous. In this imposing garb of caution and prudence,
their opinion appeared so plausible, and was so warmly sup-
ported by Ferdinand, that Isabella declined giving any counte-
nance to Columbus, and abruptly broke off the negociation
with him which she had begun.

THis was more mortifying to Columbus than all the difap-

pointmcnts which he had hitherto met with. The invitation
to court from Isabella, like an unexpeced ray of light, had
opened such profpeats of success, as encouraged him to hope
that his labours were at an end; but now darkness and uncer-
tainty returned, and his mind, firm as it was, could hardly
support the ihock of such an unforeseen rcvcrfe. He withdrew
in deep anguish from court, with an intention of prosecuting
his voyage to England, as his last resource.

duSion of which extirpated a foreign power from the heart of fuccfful.
their dominions, and rendered them masters of all the provinces, JanuaF2.
extending from the bottom of the Pyrenees to the frontiers of
Portugal. As the flow of spirits which accompanies success
elevates the mind, and renders it enterprising, Quintanilla and
Santangel, the vigilant and discerning patrons of Columbus,
took advantage of this favourable situation, in order to make
one effort more in behalf of their friend. They addressed
themselves to Isabella, and, after expressing ome surprise, that
she, who had always been the munificent patroness of gene-
rous undertakings, should hesitate so long to countenance the
most splendid scheme that had ever been proposed to any mo-
narch ; they represented to her, that Columbus was a man of a
found understanding and virtuous characser, well qualified, by
his experience in navigation, as well as his knowledge of
geometry, to form just ideas with refped to the ftrudure of
the globe and the situation of its various regions; that, by of-
fering to risk his own life and fortune in the execution of his
scheme, he gave the most satisfying evidence both of his inte-
grity and hope offuccefs; that the um requisite for equipping
such an armament as he demanded was inconsiderable, and the
advantages which might accrue from his undertaking were im-
mense; that he demanded no recompence for his invention and
labour, but what was to arise from the countries which he
fliould discover; that, as it was worthy of her magnanimity to
make this noble attempt to extend the sphere of human know-
ledge, and to open an intercoulife with regions hitherto un-
known, to it would affor(l the highest fatisfaSLion to her piety
and zeal, after re-eflabliilig the Chriflian faith in those pro-

and bleflings of divine truth; that if now she did not decide
instantly, the opportunity would be irretrievably loft; that
Columbus was on his way to foreign countries, where some
prince, more fortunate or adventurous, would close with his
proposals, and Spain would for ever bewail the fatal timidity
which had excluded her from the glory and advantages that
she had once in her power to have enjoyed.

THESE forcible arguments, urged by persons of such autho-

rity, and at a jundure so well chosen, produced the desired es-
sect. They dispelled all Isabella's doubts and fears; she ordered
Columbus to be instantly recalled, declared her resolution of
employing him on his own terms, and regretting the low fate
of her finances, generously offered to pledge her own jewels,
in order to raise as much money as might be needed in making
preparations for the voyage. Santangel, in a transport of gra-
titude, kissed the queen's hand, and in order to save her from
having recourse to such a mortifying expedient for procuring
money, engaged to advance immediately the fum that was

Portuguese claimed right as discoverers. Isabella had ordered
the ships, of which Columbus was to take the command, to be
fitted out in the port of Palos, a small maritime town in the pro-
vince of Andalusia. As the guardian Juan Perez, to whom
Columbus had already been so much indebted, resided in the
neighbourhood of this place, he, by the influence of that good
ecclesiastic, as well as by his own connetion with the inha-
bitants, not only raised among them what he wanted of the
fum that he was bound by treaty to advance, but engaged
several of them to accompany him in the voyage. The chief
of there associates were three brothers of the name of Pinzon,

of

of considerable wealth, and of great experience in naval as- B 0 0 I
fairs, who were willing to hazard their lives and fortunes in
the cxpedition. '49Z

BUT, after all the endeavours and efforts of Isabella and

Columbus, the armament was not suitable either to the dignity
of the nation by which it was equipped, or to the importance of
the service for which it was destined. It consisted of three
vcffels. The largest, a ship of no considerable burden, wac
commanded by Columbus, as admiral, who gave it the name
of Santa Maria, out of refpeat for the Bleflcd Virgin, whom
he honoured with singular devotion. Of the second, called the
Pinta, Martin Pinzon was captain, and his brother Francis pilot.
The third, named the Nigzna, was under the command of Vin-
cent Yanez Pinzon. These two were light 'vessels, hardly
superior in burden or force to large boats. This squadron, if
it merits that name, was victualed for twelve months, and had
on board ninety men, mostly sailors, together with a few ad-
venturers who followed the fortune of Columbus, and some
gentlemen of Isabella's court, whom flie appointed to accom-
pany him. Though the expence of the undertaking was one I-19z.
of the circumstances which chiefly alarmed the court of Spain,
and retarded so long the negotiation with Columnbus, the fin
employed in fitting out this squadron did not exceed four thou-
sand pounds.

As the art of fliplbuilding in the fifteenth century was ex-

tremely rude, and the bulk of vcncls was accommodated o o the
flort and easy voyages along tle coafll which they were accuf-
tomed to perform, it is a proof of the counage as will as cn-
tcrprifing gcnius of Columbus, that he ventured, wvith a flcct

might be exposed. His eagerness to accomplish the great design
which had so long engrossed his thoughts, made him overlook
or disregard every circumstance that would have intimidated a
mind less adventurous. lie puflied forward the preparations
with such ardour, and was seconded so effectually by the per-
sons to whom Isabella committed the superintendence of this
business, that every thing was soon in readiness for the voyage.
But as Columbus was deeply impressed with sentiments of reli-
gion, he would not set out upon an expedition lo arduous, and
of which one great object was to extend the knowledge of the
Christian faith, without imploring publickly the guidance and
protection of Heaven. With this view, he, together with all
the persons unler his command, marched in solemn procession
to the monafiery of Rabida. After confessing their fins, and
obtaining absolution, they received the holy sacrament from
the hands of the guardian, who joined his prayers to theirs
for the success of an enterprise which he had so zealously
patronized.

His departure NEXT morning, being Friday the third day of Augufl, in
from Spain. the year one thousand four hundred and ninety-two, Columbus

set fail, a little before sun-rise, in presence of a vafi crowd of
fpeaators, who ent up their supplications to Heaven for the
prosperous issue of the voyage, which they wilfed, rather than
expected. Columbus fIcered direcly for the Canary Islands,
August 13. and arrived there without any occurrence that would have de-

served notice on any other occasion. But, in a voyage of such
expetation and importance, every circumfiance was the object

8 f

of attention. The rudder of the Pinta broke loose, the day B OO K
after he left the harbour, and that accident alarmed the crew, _
no le's fuperflitious than unflkilful, as a certain omen of the 1492.
unfortunate destiny of the expedition. Even in the short run
to the Canaries, the hips were found to be so crazy and ill ap-
pointed, as to be very improper for a navigation which was
expected to be both long and dangerous. Columbus refitted
them, however, to the best of his power, and having supplied
himself with fresh provisions, he took his departure from Go-
mera, one of the most weflerly of the Canary Illands, on the
sixth day of September.

HERE the voyage of discovery may properly be said to begin; The courfr

for Columbus holding his course duc weft, left immediately the hih he
usual trat of navigation, and firetched into unfrequented and
unknown eas. The first day, as it was very calm, he made
but little way; but on the second, lie loft fight of the Cana-
ries; and many of the sailors, dejeaed already and dismayed,
when they contemplated the boldness of the undertaking, be-
gan to beat their breasts, and to shed tears, as if they were
never more to behold land. Columbus comforted them with
assurances of success, and the profpeft of vast wealth, in those
opulent regions whither he was conducling them. This early
discovery of the spirit of his followers taught Columbus, that
he must prepare to firuggle, not only with the unavoidable dif-
ficulties which might be expected from the nature of his under-
taking, but with such as were likely to arise from the ignorance
and timidity of the people under his command; and he per-
ceived that the art of governing the minds of men would be no
less rcquifite fr accomplifling the discoveries which he had
in view, than naval skill and undaunted courage. Happily

'-- ' he joined to the ardent temper and inventive genius of a pro-
I49' je&or, virtues of another species, which are rarely united with

them. He possessed a thorough knowledge of mankind, an
insinuating address, a patient perseverance in executing any
plan, the perfce government of his own passions, and the ta-
lent of acquiring the direction of those of other men. All these
qualities, which formed him for command, were accompanied
with that superior knowledge of his profeflion, which begets

Vigilance and confidence in times of difficulty and danger. To unskilful
Columbus. Spaniih sailors, accufRomed only to coafiing voyages in the

Mediterranean, the maritime science of Columbus, the fruit of
thirty years experience, improved by an acquaintance with all
the inventions of the Portuguese, appeared imnmenfe. As soon
as they put to sea, he regulated every thing by his sole autho-
rity; he superintended the execution of every order; and al-
lowing himself only a few hours for sleep, he was at all other
times upon deck. As his course lay through eas which had
not formerly been visited, the founding-line, or instruments
for observation, were continually in his hands. After the ex-
ample of the Portuguese discoverers, he attended to the motion
of tides and currents, watched the flight of birds, the appear-
ance of fifies, of sea-weeds, and of every thing that floated on
the waves, and entered every occurrence, with a minute c:act-
ncfs, in the journal which he kept. As the length of the
voyage could not fail of alarming sailors habituated only to
short excursions, Columbus endeavoured to conceal fiomn them
the real progress which they made. With this view, thoughi they
run eighteen leagues on the fccond day after they left Gomcra,
he gave out that they had advanced only ifteen, and lie uni-
formly employed the fame artilice of reckoning fiort during

the

the whole voyage. By the fourteenth of September, the fleet B 0 K

I1.

was above two hundred leagues to the weft of the Canary Ifes,
at a greater difiance fiom land than any Spaniard had been Apprel2n-
before that time. There they were tiruck with an appearance flOn1' ,ad
no less aftonifling than new. They obfcrvcd, that the mlag- hiscrew.
netic needle, in their compasses, did not point exadly to the
polar flar, but varied towards the welt; and as they pro-
ceeded, this variation increased. This appearance, which is
now familiar, though it flill remains one of the myfleries of
nature, into the cause of which the sagacity of man hath not
been able to penetrate, filled the companions of Columbus with
terror. They were now in a boundless unknown ocean, far
from the usual course of navigation; nature itself seemed to be
altered, and the only guide which they had left was about to
fail them. Columbus, with no less quickncfs than ingenuity,
invented a reason for this appearance, which, though it did not
satisfy himifelf, seemed so plausible to them, that it dispellcd
their fears, or silenced their murmurs.

HE fill continued to fleer due weft, nearly in the fame lati-

tude with the Canary Ilands. In this course he came within
the sphere of the trade wind, which blows invariably from east
to wclt, between the tropics and a few degrees beyond them.
He advanced before this fieady gale with such uniform rapidity,
tlat it was felloin neccflary to shift a ail. When about four
hundred leagues to the weft of the Canaries, lie found the sea
so covered with weeds, that it rccmblcd a meadow of valt ex-
tent; and in lome places they were 1o thick, as to retard the
motion of the vcli s. Thlls fIrange appearance occasioned
new alarm and dit llluict. The aiilors inagilned that they
were now arrivcd at the utmoil boundary of tle navigable

ocean ;

B 0 K ocean; that these floating weeds would obflrud their farther
u-- -- progress, and concealed dangerous rocks, or ome large tract

of land, which had funk, they knew not how, in that place.
Columbus endeavoured to persuade them, that what had
alarmed, ought rather to have encouraged them, and was to be
confidered as a sign of approaching land. At the fame time, a
brisk gale arose, and carried them forward. Several birds were
seen hovering about the ship , and direced their flight towards
the weft. The desponding crew resumed ome degree of spirit,
and began to entertain freih hopes.
Tlere in- UPON the first of Odober they were, according to the ad-

ceae. miral's reckoning, seven hundred and seventy leagues to the

weft of the Canaries; but left his men should be intimidated by
the prodigious length of the navigation, he gave out that they
had proceeded only five hundred and eighty-four leagues; and,
fortunately for Columbus, neither his own pilot, nor those of
the other Lips, had skill sufficient to corret this error, and
discover the deceit. They had now been above three weeks at
sea; they had proceeded far beyond what former navigators
had attempted or deemed poflible; all their prognostics of disco-
vcry, drawn from the flight of birds and other circumfiances,
had proved fallacious; the appearances of land, with which
their own credulity or the artifice of their commander had fiomn
time to time flattered and amused them, had been altogether
illusive, and their prof)pcc of success seemed now to be as dif-
tant as ever. These reflecions occurred often to men, who
had no other objet or occupation, than to rcafon and dlilourfe
concerning the intention and circumfianccs of their expedition.

They made impreflion, at first, upon the ignorant and timid, B K
and extending, by degrees, to such as were better informed
or more resolute, the contagion spread at length from flip to 4)'2
sip. From fecrct whifpcrs or murmurings, they proceeded
to open cabals and public complaints. They taxed their fove-
reign with inconsiderate credulity, in paying such regard to the
vain promises and rash conjecturcs of an indigent foreigner, as
to hazard the lives of so many of her own fubijeds, in prose-
cuting a chimerical scheme. They affirmed that they had fully
performed their duty, by venturing so far in an unknown and
hopeless course, and could incur no blame for refuting to follow,
any longer, a desperate adventurer to certain destruction. They
contended, that it was necefTary to think of returning to Spain,
while their crazy vffels were still in a condition to keep the
sea, but expressed their fears that the attempt would prove vain,
as the wind, which had hitherto been so favourable to their
course, inuff render it irnpoffible to fail in the opposite direction.
All agreed that Columbus should be compelled by force to adopt
a measure on which their common safety depended. Some of
the more audacious propored, as the most expeditious and cer-
tain method for getting rid at once of his remonltrances, to
throw him into the sea, being persuaded that, upon their return
to Spain, the death of an unsuccessful projcdor would excite
little concern, and be inquired into with no criofity.

COLU MBUS was fully sensible of his perilous situation. He Ti. I1rf;

had ol)frvedl, with great concern, the fatal operation of igno- i, roothing
rance and of fear in producing disaffection among his crew, and thlm.

B OI K agitation and solicitude of his own mind, he appeared with a

---- cheerful countenance, like a man satisfied with the progress
1492. which he had made, and confident of success. Sometimes he

employed all the arts of insinuation to soothe his men. Some-
times he endeavoured to work upon their ambition or avarice,
by magnificent descriptions of the fame and wealth which they
were about to acquire. On other occasions, he assumed a tone
of authority, and threatened them with vengeance from their
sovereign, if, by their daflardly behaviour, they hould defeat
this noble effort to promote the glory of God, and to exalt the
Spanish name above that of every other nation. Even with
seditious sailors, the words of a man whom they had been ac-
cuflomed to reverence, were weighty and persuasive. They
not only restrained them from those violent excesses, which
they meditated, but prevailed with them to accompany their
admiral for sone time longer.

Their fears As they proceeded, the indications of approaching land
riurn.

seemed to be more certain, and excited hope in proportion.
The birds began to appear in flocks, making towards the
fouth-welt. Columbus, in imitation of the Portuguese navi-
gators, who had been guided, in several of their discoveries, by
the motion of birds, altered his course from due well towards
that quarter whither they pointed their flight. But, after
holding on for leveral (lays in tihis new dirction, without any
better success than fbrmerly, having fccn no objea, during
thirty dlays, but the sea and the fy, the hopes of his companions
fiibfidcd fiafter than they had rifcn ; their fars revived with ad-
ditional frce ; impatience, rage, and ldc)air, appeared in every
)in;nr' ora coultcllellnce. All sense of fiborliriation was loll: thc officcrs,

who had hlithrto concurred witih Columbus in opinion, and liip-

ported
4

ported his authority, now took part with the private men; B K
they assembled tumultuously on the deck, expoftulated with _-.
their commander, mingled threats with their expoflulations,
and required him inflantly to tack about and return to Europe.
Columbus perceived that it would be of no avail to have re-
course to any of his former arts, which having been tried o
often, had loft their effed; and that it was impossible to re-
kindle any zeal for the success of the expedition among men, in
whose breasts fear had extinguished every generous sentiment.
He saw that it was no less vain to think of employing either Diflrefsof
gentle or severe measures, to quell a mutiny so general and so C s.
violent. It was necessary, on all these accounts, to foothepaf-
sions which he could no longer command, and to give way to a
torrent too impetuous to be checked. He promied solemnly to
his men that he would comply with their request, provided
they would accompany him, and obey his commands for three
days longer, and if, during that time, land were not disco-
vered, he would then abandon the enterprise, and direc his
course towards Spain .

ENRAGED as the ailors were, and impatient to turn their Encouraging

appearances

faces again towards their native country, this proposition did of fuccefi.
not appear to them unreasonable. Nor did Columbus hazard
much in confining himself to a term so short. The presages
of discovering land were now so numerous and promising, that
he deemed them infallible. For ome days the founding line
reached the bottom, and the foil which it brought up indicated
land to be at no great distance. The flocks of birds increased,
and were composed not only of sea fowl, but of fich land

^--v- The crew of the Pinta observed a cane floating, which seemed

to have been newly cut, and likewise a piece of timber artifi-
cially carved. The sailors aboard the Nigna took up the branch
of a tree with red berries, perfectly fresh. The clouds around
the setting fun assumed a new appearance; the air was -nore
mild and warm, and, during night, the wind became unequal
and variable. From all these symptoms, Columbus was so con-
sident of being near land, that on the evening of the eleventh
of October, after public prayers for success, he ordered the
fails to be furled, and the hips to lie by, keeping ftrit watch,
left they should be driven aflore in the night. During this
interval of fufpence and expecation, no man shut his eyes,
all kept upon deck, gazing intently towards that quarter
where they expected to discover the land, which had been fC
long the objectLof their wishes.

Land dico- ABOUT two hours before midnight, Columbus, standing on
vcrcd. the forecastle, observed a light at a distance, and privately

pointed it out to Pedro Guttierez, a page of the queen's ward-
robe. Guttierez perceived it, and calling to Salcedo, comptroller
of the fleet, all three saw it in motion, as if it were carried
from place to place. A little after midnight, the joyful found
of land, land, was heard from the Pinta, which kept always
a head of the other flips. But, having been so often deceived
by fallacious appearances, every man was now become flow of
belief, and waited, in all the anguish of uncertainty and impa-

Fr;day, tience, for the return of day. As oon as morning dawned,
os'i. all doubts and fears were dispelled. From every ship an island

was seen about two leagues to the north, whose flat and verdant
fields, well flored with wood, and watered with many rivulets,

presented

presented the asped of a delightful country. The crew of the BOO K
Pinta instantly began the Te Deum, as a hymn of thanksgiving i
to God, and were joined by those of the other ships, with tears
of joy and transports of congratulation. This office of grati-
tude to Heaven was followed by an aa ofjuftice to their com-
mander. They threw themselves at the feet of Columbus,
with feelings of felf-condemnation mingled with reverence.
They implored him to pardon their ignorance, incredulity, and
insolence, which had created him so much unnecesSary disquiet,
and had so often obftruded the prosecution of his well-concerted
plan; and passing, in the warmth of their admiration, from
one extreme to another, they now pronounced the man, whom
they had so lately reviled and threatened, to be a person inspired
by Heaven with sagacity and fortitude more than human, in
order to accomplish a design, so far beyond the ideas and con-
ception of all former ages.

As oon as the fun arose, all the boats were manned and Firi inter-

played, with warlike music, and other martial pomp; and as
they approached the coast, they saw it covered with a multitude
of people, whom the novelty of the fpedacle had drawn toge-
ther, and whose attitudes and gestures expressed wonder and
aflonifhment at the firange objecs which presented themselves
to their view. Columbus was the firfl European who fct foot in
the New World which he had discovered. HIc landed in a rich
dress, and with a naked sword in his hand. His men followed,
and kneeling down, they all kilfed the ground which they had
so long desired to fee. They next ered a crucifix, and pro-
ftrating themfelvcs before it, returned thanks to God for con-
dueing their voyage to luch an happy illic. They then took

veries '.

Their mutual THE Spaniards, while thus employed, were surrounded by
afolifhment. many of the natives, who gazed, in silent admiration, upon

actions which they could not comprehend, and of which they
did not foresee the consequences. The dress of the Spaniards,
the whiteness of their skins, their beards, their arms, appeared
firange and surprising. The vast machines in which they had
traversed the ocean, that seemed to move upon the waters with
wings, and uttered a dreadful found resembling thunder, ac-
companied with lightning and smoke, firuck them with such
terror, that they began to refped their new guests as a superior
order of beings, and concluded that they were children of the
Sun, who had descended to visit the earth.

THE Europeans were hardly less amazed at the scene now

before them. Every herb, and hrub, and tree, was different
from those which flourished in Europe. The foil seemed to be
rich, but bore few marks of cultivation. The climate, even
to Spaniards, felt warm, though extremely delightful. The
inhabitants appeared in the simple innocence of nature, en-
tirely naked. Their black hair, long and uncurled, floated
upon their houlders, or was bound in treires around their
heads. They had no beards, and every part of their bodies
was perfealy smooth. Their complexion was of a duiky cop-
per colour, their features singular, rather than disagreeable,
their afpeat gentle and timid. Though not tall, they were

well shaped, and ative. Their faces, and several parts of their B OO K
body, were fantastically painted with glaring colours. They '----.
were shy at first through fear, but oon became familiar with
the Spaniards, and with transports of joy received from them
hawks-bells, glass. beads, or other baubles, in return for
which they gave such provisions as they had, and ome
cotton yarn, the only commodity of value that they could
produce. Towards evening, Columbus returned to his hips,
accompanied by many of the ilanders in their boats, which
they called canoes, and though rudely formed out of the trunk
of a ingle tree, they rowed them with surprising dexterity.
Thus, in the first interview between the inhabitants of the old
and new worlds, every thing was conducted amicably, and to
their mutual fatisfadion. The. former, enlightened and am-
bitious, formed already vati ideas with refpeaq to the advantages
which they might derive from the regions that began to open
to their view. The latter, imple and undifcerning, had no
foresight of the calamities and desolation which were approach-
ing their country.

COLUMBUS, who now afumed the title and authority of Cumlius

afltMCS the

admiral and viceroy, called the island which lie had discovered itel" of a-'
San Salvador. It is better known by the name of Guanahani, miral and

~~~~~- ~viceroy.

which the natives gave to it, and is one of that large clufler of
islands called the Lucaya or Bahama iles. It is situated above
three thousand miles to the weft of Gomera, from which the
squadron took its departure, and only four degrees to the south
of it; so little had Columbus deviated from the weftcrly course,,
which he had chosen as the most proper.

warda the

B 0 o K he perceived that this was not the rich country for which he

covery of those regions of Asia which firetched towards the east,
lie concluded that San Salvador was one of the isles which
geographers described as situated in the vast ocean adjacent to
India '. Having observed that most of the people whom he
had seen wore small plates of gold, by way of ornament, in
their nostrils, he eagerly inquired where they got that precious
metal. They pointed towards the south, and made him com-
prehend by signs, that gold abounded in countries situated in
that quarter. Thither he immediately determined to direc his
course, in full confidence of finding there those opulent regions
which had been the object of his voyage, and would be a re-
compence for all his toils and dangers. He took along with
him seven of the natives of San Salvador, that, by acquiring
the Spanish language, they might serve as guides and inter-
preters; and those innocent people confidered it as a mark of
diftindion when they were feleded to accompany him.

Discovers HE saw several islands, and touched at three of the largest,
Cuba.

on which he bestowed the names of St. Mary of the Conception,
Fernandina, and Isabella. But as their foil, productions, and
inhabitants, nearly resembled those of San Salvador, he made
no stay in any of them. He inquired every where for
gold, and received uniformly for answer, that it was brought
from the south. He followed that course, and oon disco-
vered a country of vast extent, not perfetly level, like
those which he had already visited, but so diversified with
rising grounds, hills, rivers, woods, and plains, that he was
uncertain whether it might prove an island, or part of the con-

tinent. The natives of San Salvador, whom he had on board, B 0O0 K
called it Cuba; Columbus gave it the name of Juanna. He i
entered the mouth of a large river with his squadron, and all
the inhabitants fled to the mountains as' he approached the shore.
But as he resolved to careen his ships in that place, he sent some
Spaniards, together with one of the people of San Salvador, to
view the interior parts of the country. They, having advanced
above sixty miles from the shore, reported, upon their return,
that the foil was richer and more cultivated than any they
had hitherto discovered; that, besides many scattered cot-
tages, they had found one village, containing above a thou-
sand inhabitants; that the people, though naked, seemed to be
more intelligent than those of San Salvador, but had treated
them with the fame refpeaful attention, kissing their feet, and
honouring them as sacred beings allied to Heaven; that they
had given them to eat a certain root, the tafle of which refem-
bled roared chefnuts, and likewise a singular species of corn
called maize, which, either when roasted whole or ground into
meal, was abundantly palatable; that there seemed to be no
four-footed animals in the country, but a species of dogs, which
could not bark, and a creature resembling a rabbit, but of a
much fialler size; that they had observed ome ornaments of
gold among the people, but of no great value .

THESE messengers had prevailed with rome of the natives to -lis conjec-

B 1 o K tinually upon his own theory concerning the diScovery of the
I -- -- East Indies, he was led, by the resemblance of found, to sup-

pose that they spoke of the Great Khan, and imagined that the
opulent kingdom of Cathay, described by Marco Polo, was not
very remote. This induced him to employ some time in view-
ing the country. He visited almost every harbour, from Porto
del Principe, on the north coast of Cuba, to the eastern extre-
mity of the island; but, though delighted with the beauty of
the scenes, which every where presented themselves, and
amazed at the luxuriant fertility of the foil, both which, from
their novelty, made a more lively impression upon his imagi-
nation x, he did not find gold in such quantity as was sufficient
to satisfy either the avarice of his followers, or the expectations
of the court to which he was to return. The people of the
country, as much astonished at his eagerness in queRl of gold, as
the Europeans were at their ignorance and simplicity, pointed
towards the east, where an island which they called Hayti was
situated, in which that metal was more abundant than among
them. Columbus ordered his squadron to bend its course thither;
but Martin Alonfo Pinzon, impatient to be the firfi who should
take poffeflion of.the treasures which this country was supposed
to contain, quitted his companions, regardless of all the admiral's
signals to flacken fail, until they hould come up with him.

Difcovee the COLUMBUS, retarded by contrary winds, did not reach
iflod Ii,(pa- HIayti till the sixth of December. He called the port where

he first touched St. Nicholas, and the island itself Efpagnola,
in honour of the kingdom by which he was employed; and it
is the only country, of those he had yet discovered, which has
retained the name that he gave it. As he could neither meet

quitted St. Nicholas, and failing along the northern coast of the 2'
island, he entered another harbour, which he called Concep-
tion. Here he was more fortunate; his people overtook
a woman who was flying from them, and after treating
her with great gentleness, difmiiffed her with a prcfent of
such toys as they knew were most valued in those regions.
The description which he gave to her countrymen of the hu-
manity and wonderful qualities of the strangers; their admira-
tion of the trinkets, which she fihewed with exultation; and
their eagerness to participate of the fame favours; removed all
their fears, and induced many of them to repair to the harbour.
The strange objeds which they beheld, and the baubles which
Columbus bestowed upon them, amply gratified their curiosity
and their wishes. They nearly resembled the people of Guana-
hani and Cuba. They were naked like them, ignorant, and
simple; and seemed to be equally unacquainted with all the
arts which appear most necessary in polifled societies; but
they were gentle, credulous, and timid, to a degree which
rendered it easy to acquire the ascendant over them, ecpccially

COLUMBUS, fill intent on discovering the mines which

yielded gold, continued to interrogate all the natives with whom
he had any intercourse concerning their situation. They con-
curred in pointing out a mountainous country, which they
called Cibao, at some diflance from the sea, and farther towards
the eaf. Struck with this found, which appeared to him the
fame with Cipango, the name by which Marco Polo, and
other travellers to the east, diflinguifhed the ilands of Japan,
he no longer doubted with refpec to the vicinity of the coun-
tries which he had diicovered to the remote parts of Alia; and,.
in full expecation of reaching soon those regions which had
been the object of his voyage, he directed his course towards the
east. H-Ie put into a commodious harbour, which he called St.
Thomas, and found tlat diftric to be under the government of
a powerful cazi(lqe, named GiItncni hri, who, as lie aftcr-
wards learned, was one of the five lovercigns among whom the
whole island was divided. He immediitcly flnt mefclgcrs to
Columbus, who, in his name, delivered to him the prefcnt of a
maflc curiously faflioned, with the cars, nose, and monthl of
beaten gold, and invited hiin to the llace of his residence, near
the harbour now called Cape Fran;ois, some leagues tolwards

to claim more attention. They returned, with such favourable B OO K
accounts both of the country and of the people, as made Co- -
lumbus impatient for that interview with Guacanahari to which I49Z'
he had been invited.

HE failed for this purpose from St. Thomas, on the twenty- OneoF his

fourth of December, with a fair wind, and the sea perfecly1
calm; and as, amidst the multiplicity of his occupations, he
had not shut his eyes for two days, he retired at midnight, in
order to take some repose, having committed the helm to the
pilot, with fhrict injunLions not to quit it for a moment. The
pilot, dreading no danger, carclelsly left the helm to an un-
experienced cabin-boy, and the ihip, carried away by a current,
was dashed against a rock. T'he violence of the fiock awakened
Columbus. He ran up to the deck. There, all was confusion
and despair. He alone retained presence of mind. He ordered
some of the sailors to take a boat, and carry out an anchor
afern; but, inflead of obeying, they made off towards the
Nigna, which was about half a league distant. I-e then com-
manded the malts to be cut down, in order to lighten the lhip;
but all his cndeavours were too late; the vcffel opened near the
keel, and filled so fast with water, that its loss was inevitable.
The limoctlhnefs of the sea, and the timely affiflance of boats
fronm the Nigna, cial)lld the crew to l ve their lives. As soon as
the ilandcrs heard of this (lifaflr, they crowded to the fiore,
with tlleir prince Guacanahari at their head. Inflcad ot taking
advantage of the dilrcef in which they beheld the Spaniards,
to attemilpt any thing to tilcir detriment, they lamencted their
misfortune with tears of' inmcie condola;nce. Not iatislic(l with
tiis unavailing cxprcflion of' tllcir Yviiipatily, they put to Ica
a vail number of canoes, and, under the dircdlion of tile

<-- wreck; and, by the united labour of so many hands, almost

every thing of value was carried ashore. As fatl as the goods
were landed, Guacanahari in person took charge of them. By
his orders, they were all deposited in one place, and armed
centinels were polled, who kept the multitude at a diltance, in
order to prevent them not only from embezzling, but from in-
specing too curiously what belonged to their guefis . Next
morning this prince visited Columbus, who was now on board
the Nigna, and endeavoured to console him for his loss, by
offering all that he poifeied to repair it .

Dirrefs of THE condition of Columbus was such, that he flood in need

the Pinta, and no longer doubted but that his treacherous affo-
ciate had set fail for Europe, in order to have the merit of
carrying the filrt tidings of the extraordinary discoveries which
had been made, and to pre-occupy so far the ear of their so-
vereign, as to rob him of the glory and reward to which he was
jufily intitled. There remained but one vessel, and that the
fmlalleft and moll crazy of the squadron, to traverse such a vast
ocean, and carry so many men back to Europe. Each of those
circumfiances was alarming, and filled the mind of Columbus
with the utmost solicitude. The desire of overtaking Pinzon,.
and of effacing the unfavourable impressions which his miire-
prcfentations might make in Spain, made it necessary to return

Rcolves to thither without delay. The difficulty of taking such a number

those advantages which he expeted from his discoveries. When
he mentioned this to his men, all approved of the design; and
from impatience under the fatigue of a long voyage, from the
levity natural to sailors, or from the hopes of amassing vaIt

thought himlelf already lt.f under the patronage of beings

The grounl was marked out tor a frall fort, which Columbus
called NaviLda, because he had landed there on Chrilimas day.
A deep ditch was drawn around it. The ramparts were forti-
sied with pllifades, and the great guns, saved out of the ad-
miral's lhip, were planted upon them. In ten days the work
was finiflled; that simple race o men labouring with incon-
fiderate afliduity in ercding this firfl monument of their
own fcrvituide. During this time Columbus, by his carecles
and liberality, laboured to incrcal tlhe high opinion which the

and unacquainted with any hostile weapons, but arrows of 14)

javelins hardened in the fire, wondered and trembled. Before
this llrprife or fear had time to abate, he ordered the great
guns to be fired. The iLdden exp]olion struck them with fch
terror, that they fell flat to the ground, covering their faces
with their hands; and when they beheld the aftonifiing clftct
of the bullets, they concluded that it was iilpoffible to resist
men, who had the cornmand of fucli delrultive instruments,
and who came armed with thunder and lightl:ing against their
enemies.

AFTER giving such impressions both of the beneficence and tlii innruc-

ponwer of the Spaniards, as might have rendered it easy to pre- ' h tin t.

appointed thirty-eigllt of his people to remain in the illand.

Colony, he left Navidad on the fourth of January, one thou-

east, discovered, and gave names to mofi of the harbours on
the northern coast of the island. On the sixth, he descried
the Pinta, and soon came up with her, after a separation of
more than fix weeks. Pinzon endeavoured to juffify his con-
duct, by pretending that he had been driven from his course
by firess of weather, and prevented from returning by con-
trary winds. The admiral, though he frill fufpeEted his per-
fidious intentions, and knew well what he urged in his own
defence to be frivolous as well as false, was so sensible that this
was not a proper time for venturing upon any high strain of
authority, and felt such fatisfadion in this junEtion with his
consort, which delivered him from many disquieting apprehen-
sions, that lame as Pinzon's apology was, he admitted of it
without difficulty, and restored him to favour. During his
absence from the admiral, Pinzon had visited fcveral harbours
in the island, had acquired some gold by trafficking with the
natives, but had made no discovery of any importance.

of the natives, whom he had taken from the different islands

productions which were likely to become fubjeds of commerce
in the several countries, as well as many unknown birds, and
other natural curiosities, which might attract the attention of
the learned, or excite the wonder of the people. The voyage
was prosperous to the fourteenth of February, and he had ad-

the wind began to rife, and continued to blow with increasing
rage, which terminated in a furious hurricane. Every expedi-
ent that the naval skill and experience of Columbus could devise
was employed, in order to save the ships. But it was impossible
to withstand the violence of the storm, and as they were frill far
from any land, destruCtion seemed inevitable. The sailors had
recourse to prayers to Almighty God, to the invocation of
faints, to vows and charms, to every thing that religion dic-
tates, or superstition suggests, to the affrighted mind of man.

fonal danger. Less affected with the loss of life, than solicitous
to preserve the memory of what he had attempted and atchiev-
ed, he retired to his cabbin, and wrote, upon parchment, a
short account of the voyage which he had made, of the course
which he had taken, of the situation and riches of the countries
which he had discovered, and of the colony that he had left
there. Having wrapt up this in an oiled cloth, which he in-
closed in a cake of wax, he put it into a cask carefully flopped
up, and threw it into the ea, in hopes that ome fortunate

Azores or wcftern isles, fibjeat to the crown of Portugal. There,
after a violent contell with the governor, in which Columbus
displaycd no less spirit than prudence, he obtained a supply of
fresh provisions, and whatever elte he needed. One circum-

soon as his ship was discovered approaching the port, all
the inhabitants of Palos ran eagerly to the shore, in order
to welcome their relations and fellow-citizens, and to hear
tidings of their voyage. When the prosperous issue of it
was known, when they beheld the strange people, the un-
known animals, and singular productions brought from the
countries which had been discovered, the effusion of joy was
general and unbounded. The bells were rung, the cannon
fired; Columbus was received at landing with royal honours,
and all the people, in solemn proceiflon, accompanied him and
his crew to the church, where they returned thanks to Heaven,
which had so wonderfully conducted and crowndd with success,
a voyage of greater length and of more importance, than had
been attempted in any former age. On the evening of the

Ferdinand and Isabella, no less atonifhed than delighted with
ithis unexpected event, desired Columbus, in terms the mofl

efpectful and flattering, to repair immediately to court, that
from his own mouth, they might receive a full detail of his
extraordinary services and discoveries. During his journey
to Barcclona, the people crowded from the adjacent country,
following him every where with admiration and applause.

His entrance into the city was conduaced, by order of Ser- B 0o K
dinand and Isabella, with pomp suitable to the great event, _
which added such distinguishing lustre to their reign, The '493
people whom he brought along with him from the countries
which he had discovered, marched firfi, and by their singular
complexion, the wild peculiarity of their features, and un-
couth finery, appeared like men of another species. Next
to them were carried the ornaments of gold, fashioned by the
rude art of the natives, the grains of gold found in the moun-
tains, and dust of the fame metal gathered in the rivers.
After these appeared the various commodities of the new dif-
covered countries, together with their curious producqions.
Columbus himself closed the procession, and attracted the eyes
of all the fpedators, who gazed with admiration on the extra-
ordinary man, whose superior sagacity and fortitude had con-
duced their countrymen, by a route concealed from pall ages, to
the knowledge of a new world. Ferdinand and Isabella received
him clad in their royal robes, and feated upon a throne, under a
magnificent canopy. When he approached they flood up, and
raising him as he kneeled to kifs their hands, commanded him
to take his feat upon a chair prepared for him, and to give a
circumfantial account of his voyage. He delivered it with
a gravity and -composure no less suitable to the difpolition of the
Spanish nation, than to the dignity of the audience in which
he poke, and with that modell simplicity which charadterifes
men of fuporior minds; who, satisfied with having performed
great aion's, ourt not vain applause by an oflentatious display
of their exploits. When he had finished his narration, the

nour that gratitude or admiration could suggest was conferred
upon Columbus. Letters patent were iflued, confirming to
him and to his heirs all the privileges contained in the capitula-
tion concluded at Santa Fe; his family was ennobled; the king
and queen, and, after their example, the courtiers, treated him,
on every occasion, with all the ceremonious refpea paid to per-
sons of the highest rank. But what pleated him most, as it
gratified his ative mind, bent continually upon great objecs,
was an order to equip, without delay, an armament of such
force, as might enable him not only to take poffeflion of the
countries which he had already discovered, but to go in search
of those more opulent regions, which he fiill confidently ex-
pected to find .

discerning the effects, of this great discovery, received the

and observation opened, as would lead mankind to a perfec B 0 0 K
acquaintance with the firudure and produtions of the habitable __
globe . Various opinions and conjectures were formed conl- 193
cerning the new-found countries, and what division of the
earth they belonged to. Columbus adhered tenaciously to his
original opinion, that they should be reckoned a part of those
vast regions in Asia, comprehended under the general name of
India. This sentiment was confirmed by the observations
which he made concerning the productions of the countries he
had discovered. Gold was known to abound in India, and he
had met with such promising samples of it in the islands which
he visited, as led him to'believe that rich mines of it might be
found. Cotton, another producion of the East Indies, was
common there. The pimento of the islands he imagined to be
a species of the Eaft-Indian pepper. He miltook a root, fomc-
what resembling rhubarb, for that valuable drug, which was
then supposed to be a plant peculiar to the East Indies h. The
birds brought home by him were adorned with the fame rich
plumage which diftinguilhes those of India. The alligator
of the one country appeared to be the fame with the crocodile
of the other. After weighing all there circunnflanccs, not only

riches and fertility, which he produced, were so considerable,
and the reports of his companions, delivered frequently with
the exaggeration natural to travellers, so favourable, as to
excite a wonderful spirit of enterprise among the Spaniards.
Though little accuflomed to naval expeditions, they were im-
patient to set out upon the voyage. Volunteers of every
rank solicited to be employed. Allured by the vail profpeds
which opened to their ambition and avarice, neither the length
nor danger of the navigation intimidated them. Cautious as
Ferdinand was, and averse to every thing new or adventurous,
he seemed to have catched the fame spirit with his fubjets.
Under its influence, preparations for a second expedition were
carried on with a rapidity unusual in Spain, and to an extent
that would be deemed not inconsiderable in the present age.
The fleet conrifted of seventeen fhlips, some of which were of
good burden. It had on board fifteen hundred persons, among
whom were many of noble families, who had served in ho-
nourable itations. The greater part of these being deflined to
remain in the country, were furnished with every thing re-
quilite for conquefl or settlement, with all kinds of European
domeflic animals, with such feeds and plants as were most
likely to thrive in the climate of the Weft Indies, with utcnfils
and inflruments of every fort, and with such artificers as might
be most ucfful in an infant colony .

Father Boyl, a Catalonian monk of great reputation, as apofto-
lical vicar, were appointed to accompany Columbus, and to
devote themfelvcs to the inflruQion of the natives. The Indians
whom Columbus had brought along with him, having received
some tin&ure of Christian knowledge, were baptized with
much solemnity, the king himself, the prince his son, and the
chief persons of his court, flanding as their godfathers. Those
first fruits of the New World have not been followed by such an
increase as pious men wished, and had reason to expet.

and to etblifh their dominion over such a valt portion of the
globe, nothing now retarded the departure of the fleet. Co-
lumbus was extremely impatient to revisit the colony which
he had left, and to pursue that career of glory upon which he
had entered. He set fail from the bay of Cadiz on the twenty-
fifth of September, and touching again at the iand of Gomera,
he ficered farther towards the south than in his former voyage.
By holding this course, he enjoyed more steadily the benefit of
the regular winds, which reign within the tropics, and was
carried towards a large cluster of islands, situated considerably
to the cafl of those which he had already difcovcred. On the
twenty-fixth day after his departure from Gomera, he made

which he gave the name of Defeada, on account of the impa-

weft. All these he found to be inhabited by that fierce race of
people whom Guacanahari had painted in such frightful co-
lours. His descriptions appeared not to have been exaggerated.
The Spaniards never attempted to land without meeting with
such a reception, as discovered the martial and daring spirit of
the natives ; and in their habitations were found relics of those
horrid feafis which they had made upon the bodies of their
enemies taken in war.

BUT as Columbus was eager to know the state of the colony Arrives at

which he hlad planted, and to supply it with the necessaries NoV. 212.a
of which he supposed it to be in want, he made no flay in
any of those islands, and proceeded directly to Hispaniola .
When he arrived off Navidad, the station in which he had
left the thirty-eight men under the command of Arada, he
was aftonilhed that none of them appeared, and expected
every moment to fee them running with transports of joy
to welcome their countrymen. Full of solicitude about their
iafety, and foreboding in his mind what had befallen them,
he rowed inflantly to land. All the natives fiom whom he
might have received information had fled. But the fort
\which he ad built was entirely dcmolifhcd, and the tattered

tended gradually to diminish the superstitious veneration with
which their firfl appearance had inspired that simple people.
By their own indifcrction and ill conduct, the Spaniards speedily
effaced those favourable impressions, and oon convinced the
natives, that they had all the wants, and weaknesses, and pas-
sions of men. As soon as the powerful restraints which the
pretence and authority of Columbus imposed was withdrawn,
the garrison threw off all regard for the officer whom he had
invested with command. Regardless of the prudent infiruc-
tions which he had given them, every man became indepen-
dent, and gratified his desires without controul. The gold,
the women, the provisions of the natives, were all the prey of
those licentious oppressors. They roamed in small parties over
the island, extending their rapacity and insolence to every cor-
ner of it. Gentle and timid as the people were, those unpro-
voked injuries at length exhaufled their patience, and rouzed
their courage. The cazique of Cibao, whose country the
Spaniards chiefly insetsed on account of the gold which it
contained, surprised and cut off fcveral of them, while they
flraggled in as perfect security as if their condut had been al-
together inoffensive. He then alfembled his fubjeCs, and fur-
rounding the fort, set it on fire. Some of the Spaniards were
killed in defending it, the relt pcrilied in attempting to make
their escape by crossing an arm of the ea. Guacanahari, whom
all their exadions had not alienated from the Spaniards, took

a proper jundure for inquiring into his conduca with fcrupu-
Ious accuracy, that he rejecled the advice of several of his ofli-
ccrs, who urged him to Ieize the person of that prince, and to
revenge the death of their countrymen by attacking his fubjcls.
-Ic represented to them the neceflity of securing the friendship
of some potentate of the country, in order to facilitate the set-
tlement which they intended, and the danger of driving the
natives to unite in some desperate attempt against them, by such
an ill-timed and unavailing exercise of rigour. Inflead of waft-
ing his time in punifling past wrongs, he took precautions for
preventing any future injury. \With this view, 1 made choice
of a situation more healthy and commodious than that of Navi-
dad. He traced out the plan of a town in a large plain near
a spacious bay, and obliging every person to put his hand to a
work on which their common safety depended, the houfcs and
ramparts were soon so far advanced by their united labour, as
to afford them fielter and security. This rirfng city, the lirft
that the Europeans founded in the New World, lie named Ifa-

Many of thein were gentlemen, unaccuflomed to the fatigue of

sanguine hopes excited by the splendid and exaggerated defcrip-
tions of their countrymen who returned from the sirs. voyage,

he had dicovcred was either the Cipango of Marco Polo, or the
Ophir r, from which Solomon imported thoie precious com-
modities which suddenly diffused such extraordinary riches

with the main body of his troops. In this expedition, he dif-
played all the pomp of military magnificence that he could ex-
hibit, in order to firike the imagination of the natives. He
marched with colours flying, with martial mulic, and with a
finall body of cavalry that paraded foinetimes in the front and
sometimes in the rear. As those were the first horses which ap-
peared in the New World, they were objects of terror no Icfs

brook gold was gathered either in lduf or in grains, ome of
which were of confidcrable size. The Indians had never opened
any mines in earch of gold. To penetrate into the bowels of
the earth, and to refine the rude ore, were operations too com-
plicated for their talents and induliry, and they had no fucl
high value for gold as to put their ingenuity and invention upon
the firetch in order to obtain it '. The small quantity of that
precious metal which they potllfsedl, was either picked up in
the beds of the rivers, or waflled from the mountains by the
heavy rains which fall within the tropics. But, from those in-
dications, the Spaniards could no longer doubt that the country
contained rich treasures in its bowels, of which they hoped foont
to be maaflrs . In order to secure the command of this valu-
able province, Columbus ereced a small fort, to which he gave
the name of St. Thomas, by way of ridicule upon some of his
incredulous followers, who would not believe that the country
produced gold, until they aw it with their own eyes, and
touched it with their hands .

and with so little skill, that it hardly yielded what was sufficient -----
for their own fubfiflance; the Spaniards at Isabella had hitherto
neither time nor leisure to clear the foil, so as to reap any con-
fiderable fruits of their own industry. On all there accounts,
they became afraid of perishing with hunger, and were reduced
already to a scanty allowance. At the fame time, the difeafcs
predominant in the torrid zone, and which rage chiefly in those
uncultivated countries, where the hand of induflry has not
opened the woods, drained the marshes, and confined the rivers
within a certain channel, began to spread among them. Alarmed
at the violence and unusual symptoms of those maladies, they
exclaimed against Columbus and his companions in the former
voyage, who, by their splendid but deceitful descriptions of
Hispaniola, had allured them to quit Spain for a barbarous
uncultivated land, where they muff either be cut off by fa-
mine, or die of unknown distempers. Several of the officers
and persons of note, instead of checking, joined in those fedi-
tious complaints. Father Boyl, the apoftolical vicar, was one
of the most turbulent and outrageous. It required all the au-
thority and address of Columbus to rc-cflablifl fordination
and tranquillity in the colony. Threats and promi-s were
alternately employed for this purpolc ; but nothing contributed
more to sooth the malcontents than the profpc)e of fiiding, in
the mines of Cibao, such a rich flore of trcaflirc as would be a
recompence for all their sufferings, and eftlace the memory of
former disappointments.

appointed his brother Don Diego, with the assistance of a coun-
cil ofofficers, to govern the illand in his absence; and gave
the command of a body of soldiers to Don Pedro Margarita,
with which he was to visit the different parts of the island,
and endeavour to eftablifl the authority of the Spaniards among
the inhabitants. Having left them very particular inftrutions
with refpedc to their conduet, he weighed anchor on the twen-
ty-fourth of April, with one hip and two small barks under
his command. During a tedious voyage of full five months,
he had a trial of almost all the numerous hardships to which
persons of his profession are exposed, without making any dif-
covery of importance, except the island of Jamaica. As he
ranged along the southern coast of Cuba , he was entangled in
a labyrinth formed by an incredible number of small islands,
to which he gave the name of the Queen's Garden. In this
unknown course, among rocks and shelves, he was retarded by
contrary winds, assaulted with furious fiorms, and alarmed with
the terrible thunder and lightning which is often almost incef-
sant between the tropics. At length his provisions fell hort;
his crew, exhausted with fatigue as well as hunger, murmured
and threatened, and were ready to proceed to the most defpe-
rate extremities against him. Beset with danger in such va-
rious forms, he was obliged to keep continual watch, to ob-
lerve every occurrence with his own eyes, to illue every order,
and to superintend the execution of it. On no occasion, was

after finishing his negociation in the court of England, had
set out for Spain by the way of France. At Paris he received
an account of the extraordinary discoveries which his brother
bad made in his first voyage, and that he was then preparing
to embark on a second expedition. Though this naturally in-
duced him to pursue his journey with the utmost dispatch, Co-
lumbus had failed for Hispaniola before he reached Spain. Ser-
dinand and Isabella received him with the refpeE due to the
brother of a man whose merit and services rendered him so con-
fpicuous; and as they knew what consolation his presence
would afford to Columbus, they pcrfuaded him to take the
command of three ships, which they had appointed to carry
provisions to the colony at Isabella .

Spaniards. Europe, afforded a temporary relief to the Spaniards from

the calamities of famine, the supply was not in such quantity
as to support them long, and the island did not hitherto yield
what was sufficient for their sustenance. They were threatened
with another danger, ill more formidable than the return of
scarcity, and which demanded more immediate attention. No
sooner did Columbus leave the island on his voyage of discovery,
than the soldiers under Margarita, as if they had been set free
from discipline and ubordination, scorned all restraint. In-
flead of conforming to the prudent inftrudions of Columbus,
they dispersed in straggling parties over the-ifland, lived at dif-
cretion upon the natives, wafted their provisions, seized their
women, and treated that inoffensive race of men with all the
insolence of military oppression a..

As long as the Indians had' any profpet that their susser-

ings might come to a period by the voluntary departure of
the invaders, they submitted in silence, and dissembled their
sorrow; but they now perceived that the yoke would be as
permanent as it was intolerable. The Spaniards had built a
town, and flirrounded it with ramparts. They had ereded
fort-s in different places. They had enclosed and sown fe-
veral fields. It was apparent that they came not to visit the
country, but to fettle in it. Though the number of those

this rude people was so imperfect, and in such exact propor- B 0O K
tion to their own consumption, that it was with difficulty they ---
could afford fubfiflance to their new guefis. Their own mode '49'
of life was so indolent and inative, the warmth of the climate
so enervating, the constitution of their bodies naturally so feeble,
and so unaccustomed to the laborious exertions of industry,
that they were satisfied with a proportion of food, amazingly
small. A handful of maize, or a little of the insipid bread made
of the caffada-root, was sufficient to support men, whose
flrength and spirits were not exhausted by any vigorous efforts
either of body or mind. The Spaniards, though the most ab-
flemious of all the European nations, appeared to them excef-
fively voracious. One Spaniard consumed as- much as several
Indians. This. keenness of appetite surprised them so much,
and eemed to them to be so insatiable, that they supposed the
Spaniards had left their own country, because it did not produce
as much as was requisite to gratify their- immoderate desire of
food, and had come among them in quest of nourifhmentb.
Self-prefervation prompted them to wish for the departure of
guests who wafted so fast their slender flock of provisions. The
injuries which they suffered, added to their impatience for this
event. They had long expected that the Spaniards would re-
tire of their own accord. They now perceived that, in order
to avert the defirudion with which they were threatened, ei-
ther by the flow consumption of famine, or by the violence of
their oppressors, it was neceTfary to assume courage; to attack
those formidable invaders with united force, and drive them
from the settlements of which they had violently taken pof-
feflion.

, ---' the Indians, when Columbus returned to Isabella. Inflamed by
War49with the unprovoked outrages of the Spaniards, with a degree of
them. rage of which their gentle natures, formed to susser and submit,

seemed hardly susceptible, they waited only for a signal from
their leaders to fall upon the colony. Some of the caziques
had already surprised and cut off several of the stragglers. The
dread of this impending danger united the Spaniards, and re-
eflablifhed the authority of Columbus, as they saw no prospect
of safety but in committing themselves to his prudent guidance.
It was how necessary to have recourse to arms, the employing
of which against the Indians, Columbus had hitherto avoided
with the greatest solicitude. Unequal as the conflict may seem,
between the naked inhabitants of the New World, armed with
clubs, flicks hardened in the fire, wooden swords, and arrows
pointed with bones or flints; and troops accustomed to the difci-
'plihe, and provided with the instruments of deftrution known
in the European art of war, the situation of the Spaniards was
far from being exempt from danger. The vast superiority of
the natives iii number, compensated many dcfecs. An handful
of men was about to encounter a whole nation. One adverse
event, or even any unforeseen delay in determining the fate of
the war, might prove fatal to the Spaniards Conscious that
success depended on the vigour and rapidity of his operations,
Columbus indtantly assembled his forces. They were reduced
to a very small number. Diseases, engendered by the warmth
and humidity of the country, had raged among them with
much violence; experience had not yet taught them the art
either of curing thefc, or the precautions requifitc for guarding
against them; two-thirds of the original adventurers were dead,

soever it may seem, to mention the last as composing part of a
military farce, they were not perhaps the least formidable and
deftruaive of the whole, when employed against naked and
timid Indians. All the caziques of the island, Guacanahari ex-
cepted, who retained an inviolable attachment to the Spaniards,
were in arms to oppose Columbus, with forces amounting, if
we may believe the Spanish hifiorians, to a hundred thousand
men. Instead of attempting to draw the Spaniards into the
fastnesses of the woods and mountains, they were so imprudent
as to take their station in the Vega Real, the most open plain
in the country. Columbus did not allow them time to perceive
their error, or to alter their position. He attacked them during
the night, when undisciplined troops are least capable of ading
with union and concert, and obtained an easy and bloodless
vitory. The consternation with which the Indians were filled
by the noise and havoc made by the fire-arms, by the impe-
tuous force of the cavalry, and the fierce onset of the dogs
was so great, that they threw down their weapons, and
fled without attempting resistance. Many were slain; more
were taken prisoners, and reduced to fervitudc d; and so tho-
roughly were the reft intimidated, that from that moment they
abandoned themlelves to despair, relinquishing all thoughts of
contending with aggrefrors whom they deemed invincible.

"---- ' all the inhabitants above the age of fourteen. Each person

w49 ho lived in those diftri6ts where gold was found, was obliged
to pay quarterly as much gold dust as filled a hawk's bell; from
those in other parts of the country, twenty-five pounds of cot-
ton were demanded. This was thefirft regular taxation of the
Indians, and erved as a precedent for exactions fill more in-
tolerable. Such an heavy imposition was extremely contrary
to those maxims which Columbus had hitherto inculcated with
respect to the mode of treating them. But intrigues were car-
rying on in the court of Spain at this juncture, in order to
undermine his power and discredit his operations, which con-
liraincd him to depart from his own system of administration.
Several unfavourable .accounts of his conduCt, as well as of the
countries discovered by him, had been transmitted to Spain.
Margarita and Father Boyl were now at court; and in order
to juflify their own conduc, or to gratify their resentment,
watched with malevolent attention for every opportunity of
spreading insinuations to his detriment. Many of the courtiers
viewed his growing reputation and power with envious eyes.
Fonseca, the archdeacon of Seville, who was intrufled with
the chief direction of Indian affairs, had conceived such an
unfavourable opinion of Columbus, for ome reafbn which
the contemporary writers have not mentioned, that he listened
with partiality to every invecive against him. It was not
cafy for an unfriended itranger, unprafifed in courtly arts,
to counteracL the machinations of lb many enemies. Co-
lumibus saw that there was but one method of supporting his
own credit, and of silencing all his advcrfarics. He mult

appeared the most intolerable of all evils, to men accustomed to
pars their days in a carclefs, improvident indolence. They
were incapable of such a regular and persevering exertion of
industry, and felt it such a grievous refiraint upon their liberty,
that they had recourse to an expedient for obtaining deliverance
from this yoke, which demonstrates the excess of their impa-
tience and despair. They formed a scheme of flarving those
oppressors whom they durst not attempt to expel; and from
the opinion which they entertained with refpea to the voracious
appetite of the Spaniards, they concluded the execution of it
to be very practicable. With this view, they fiufpended all the
operations of agriculture; they sowed no maize, they pulled
up the roots of the manioc which were planted, and retiring
to the most inacceflible parts of tle mountains, left the uncul-
tivated plains to their enemies. This desperate rcfolution pro-
duced some part of the effeats which they expctdcd. The Spa-
niards were reduced to extreme want; but they received such
seasonable supplies of provisions froin Europe, and found lb
many resources in their own ingenuity and indufiry, that thcy

of the glory and rewards to which his services and sus-
ferings intitled him. The hardships unavoidable in a new
settlement, the calamities occasioned by an unhealthy cli-

were all represented as the fruits of his restless and incon-
fiderate ambition. His prudent attention to preserve difci-
pline and ubordination was denominated excess of rigour;
the punishments which he inflicted upon the mutinous and
disorderly were imputed to cruelty. These accusations gained
such credit in a jealous court, that a commiflioner was ap-

Aguado, a groom of the bed-chamber, was the person to whom
this important trust was committed. But in this choice they

ployed in functions to which they are not equal. By listening '49S'
with eagerness to every accusation against Columbus, and encou-
raging not only the malcontent Spaniards, but even the Indians,
to produce their grievances, real or imaginary, he fomented the
spirit of dissention in the island, without eflablifling any regu-
lation of public utility, or that tended to redress the many
wrongs, with the odium of which he wified to load the admi-
ral's administration. As Columbus felt sensibly how humili-
ating his situation must be, if he flould remain in the country
while such a partial inspector observed his motions, and con-
trouled his jurifdicion, he took the resolution of returning to
Spain, in order to lay a full account of all his tranfadions, par-
ticularly with respeCt to the points in dispute between him and
his adversaries, before Ferdinand and Isabella, from whose jus-
tice and discernment he expected an equal and a favourable
decision. He committed the administration of affairs, during
his absence, to Don Bartholomew, his brother, with the title 1496.
of Adelantado, or Lieutenant-Governor. By a choice less for-
tunate, and which proved the source of many calamities to
the colony, he appointed Francis Roldan chief jufiice, with

tigue and danger, in a perpetual firuggle with the trade-winds,
which blow without variation from the cart between the tropics.
Notwithstanding the almost insuperable difficulties of such a
navigation, he persisted in his course with his usual patience
and firmness, but made so little way, that he was three months
without feeing land. At length, his provisions began to fail,
the crew was reduced to the scanty allowance of fix ounces of

the meanest sailor. But, even in this extreme diflrefs, he re-
tained the humanity which distinguishes his charadler, and
refused to comply with the earnefi solicitations of his crew,
some of whom proposed to feed upon the Indian prisoners
whom they were carrying over, and others infifled to throw

with filaine. Their cenulircs and calumnies were no more .-,-
heard of at that juncture. The gold, the pearls, the cotton, i'96.
and other commodities of value which Columbus produced,
seemed fully to refute what the malcontents had propagated
with rcfpec to the poverty of the country. By reducing the
Indians to obedience, and impoling a regular tax upon them, lie
had secured to Spain a large accefflon of new fubjic&s, and the
cfbl)liflment of a revenue that promised to be considerable.
By the mines which he had found out and examined, a source
of wealth frill more copious was opened. Great and unex-
pcced as those advantages were, Columbus represented them
only as preludes to future acquisitions, anti as the earncll of
more important discoveries, which he flill meditated, and to
which those he had already made would condut him with ease

-,-_ insufficient, or were rendered ineffcaual by the mutinous spirit
i496. of the Spaniards, and the unforeseen calamities arising from va-

rious causes. Now a plan was to be formed of a regular colony,
that might serve as a model in all future establishments. Every
particular was confidered with attention, and the whole ar-
ranged with a scrupulous accuracy. The precise number of ad-
venturers who should be permitted to embark was fixed. They
were to be of different ranks and profelfions; and the propor-
tion of each was established, according to their usefulness and
the wants of the colony. A suitable number of women was to
be chosen to accompany these new settlers. As it was the first
object to raise provisions in a country where scarcity of food
had been the occasion of so much distress, a considerable body
of husbandmen was to be carried over. As the Spaniards had
then no conception of deriving any benefit from those produc-
tions of the New World which have since yielded such large
returns of wealth to Europe, but had formed magnificent ideas,
and entertained sanguine hopes with refpea to the riches con-
tained in the mines which had been discovered, a band of work-
men, skilled in the various arts employed in digging and re-
fining the precious metals, was provided. All these emigrants
were to receive pay and subsistence for some years, at the pub-
lic expence k.

the end in view. But as it was foreseen that few would engage
voluntarily to fettle in a country, whose noxious climate had
been fatal to lo many of their countrymen, Columbus proposed
to transport to Hispaniola such malefators as had been con-

vided of crimes, which, though capital, were of a less atrocious a °°0 K
nature; and that for the future a certain proportion of the of- --
fenders usually sent to the gallies, should be condemned to 1496.
labour in the mines which were to be opened. This advice,
given without due refie&ion, was as inconliderately adopted.
The prisons of Spain were drained, in order to collect members
for the intended colony; and the judges were inftruced to re-
cruit it by their future sentences. It is not, however, with
such materials, that the foundations of a society, deflined to be
permanent, should be laid. Indutfry, sobriety, patience, and
mutual confidence are indispensably requisite in an infant fettle-
ment, where purity of morals must contribute more towards
eftablifing order than the operation or authority of laws. But
when such a mixture of what is corrupt is admitted into the
original constitution of the political body, the vices of those
unsound and incurable members will probably infect the whole,
and must certainly be productive of violent and unhappy effects.
This the Spaniards fatally experienced ; and the other European
nations having successively imitated the practice of Spain in this
particular, pernicious consequences have followed in their set-
tlements, which can be imputed to no other cause'.

THOUGH Columbus obtained, with great facility and dif- Exected

patch, the royal approbation of every mcafure and regulation
that he proposed, his endeavours to carry them into execution
were so long retarded, as mufft have tired out the patience of
any man, less accustomed to encounter and to finrmount diffi-
culties. Those delays were occasioned partly by that tcdious.
formality and spirit of procraflination, with which the Spa-

to the malicious arts of Columbus's enemies. Aflonifhed at
the reception which he met with upon his return, and overawed
by his preence, they gave way, for ome time, to a tide of
favour too ltrong for them to oppose. Their enmity, however,
was too inveterate to remain long inaStive. They resumed
their operations, and by the afliftance of Fonseca, the minister
for Indian affairs, who was now promoted to the bishopric of
Badajos, they threw in so many oblRacles to protract the pre-
parations for Columbus's expedition, that a year elapsed before
he could procure two hips to carry over a part of the supplies

course different from any he had undertaken. As he was fully
persuaded that the fertile regions of India lay to the south-west

the south, were afraid that the ships would take fire, and be-
gan to apprehend the reality of what the ancients had taught
concerning the defRruCtive qualities of that torrid region of the
globe. They were relieved, in some measure, from their fears
by a seasonable fall of rain. This, however, though so heavy
and unintermitting that the men could hardly keep the deck,
did not greatly mitigate the intenseness of the heat. The ad-
miral, who with his usual vigilance had in person direced every
operation, from the beginning of the voyage, was so much
exhausted by fatigue and want of sleep, that it brought on a
violent fit of the gout, accompanied with a fever. All these
circumstances constrained him to yield to the importunities of
his crew, and to alter his course to the north weft, in order to
reach some of the Carribee islands, where he might refit, and
be supplied with provisions.

1498. New World, far furpafes any of the fireams in our hemi-

sphere. It rolls towards the ocean such a vast body of water,
and rushes into it with uch impetuous force, that when it
meets the tide, which on that coast rites to an uncommon
height, their coliifion occasions a well and agitation of the
waves no less surprising than formidable. In this conflic, the
irresistible torrent of the river so far prevails, that it fefhens
the ocean many leagues with its flood . Columbus, before he
could perceive the danger, was entangled among those adverse
currents and tempestuous waves, and it was with the utmost
difficulty that he escaped through a narrow firait, which ap-
peared so tremendous, that he called it La Boca del Drago.
As oon as the confiernation which this occasioned permitted
him to reflect upon the nature of an appearance so extraordi-
nary, he discerned in it a source of comfort and hope. Hejuftly
concluded, that such a vast body of water as this river contain-
ed, could not be supplied by any island, but must flow through
a country of immense extent, and of consequence, that he was
now arrived at that continent which it had long been the object
of his wishes to discover. Full of this idea, he flood to the
weft along the eoaft of those provinces which are now known
by the names of Paria and Cumana. He landed in several
places, and had ome intercourse with the people, who rc-
iemblcd those of Hispaniola in their appearance and man-
ner of life. They wore, as ornaments, finall plates of gold,
and pearls of considerable value, which they willingly ex-
changed for European toys. They seemed to poffcfs a better

The admiral was so much delighted with its beauty and fertility,
that with the warm enthusiasm of a discoverer, he imagined it
to be the paradise described in Scripture, which the Almighty
chose for the residence of man, while he retained innocence
that rendered him worthy of such a habitation . Thus Co-
lumbus had the glory not only of discovering to mankind the
existence of a New World, but made considerable progress to-
wards a perfect knowledge of it; and was the first man who
conducted the Spaniards to that vast continent which has been
the chief feat of their empire, and the source of their treasures
in this quarter of the globe. The flattered condition of his
ships, scarcity of provisions, his own infirmities, together with
the impatience of his crew, prevented him from pursuing his
discoveries any farther, and made it neceflary to bear away for
Hispaniola. In his way thither he discovered the islands of
Cubagua and Margarita, which afterwards became remarkable
for their pearl-fifhery. When he arrived at Hispaniola, he was AU 3c
wafted to an extreme degree with fatigue and sickness; but found
the affairs of the colony in such a situation, as afforded him no pro-
sped: of enjoying that repose of which he flood so much in need.

.-.---' town in the New World, and the feat of the supreme courts

'49-' in the Spanish dominions there. As oon as the Spaniards

were eablifhed in this new settlement, the adelantado, that
they might neither languish in inacivity, nor have leisure to
form new cabals, marched into those parts of the island which
his brother had not yet visited or reduced to obedience. As the
people were unable to refif, they submitted every where to the
tribute which he imposed. But they soon found the burden to
be so intolerable, that, overawed as they were by the superior
power of their oppressors, they took arms against them.
Those infurreaions, however, were not formidable. A con-
slid with timid and naked Indians was neither dangerous nor
of doubtful iue.
Mutiny of BUT wfIile the adelantado was employed against them in the

Rolda field, a mutiny, of an asped far more alarming, broke out among

the Spaniards. The ringleader of it was Francis Roldan, whom
Columbus had placed in a station which required him to be the
guardian of order and tranquillity in the colony. A turbulent
and inconsiderate ambition precipitated him into this desperate
measure, so unbecoming his rank. The arguments which he
employed to seduce his countrymen were frivolous and ill-
founded. He accused Columbus and his two brothers of arro-
gance and severity; he pretended that they aimed at eftablilh-
ing an independent dominion in the country; he taxed them
with an intention of cutting off part of the Spaniards by hun-
ger and fatigue, that they might more easily reduce the re-
inainder to fubjedion ; he represented it as unworthy of Caftli

adventurers. As men have always a propensity to impute the
hardships of which they feel the pressure, to the mifcondu of 1498'
their rulers ; as every nation views with a jealous eye the power
and exaltation of foreigners, Roldan's insinuations made a deep
impreflion on his countrymen. His characer and rank added
weight to them. A considerable number of the Spaniards made
choice of him as their leader, and taking arms againit the ade-
lantado and his brother, seized the king's magazine of provi-
sions, and endeavoured to surprise the fort at St. Domingo.
This was preserved by the vigilance and courage of Don Diego
Columbus. The mutineers were obliged to retire to the pro-
vince of Xaragua, where they continued not only to difclain
the adelantado's authority thei-elves, but excited the Indians
to throw off the yoke ".

SucH was the difiraded slate of the colony when Columbus

landed at St. Domingo. He was astonished to find that the
three lhips which he had dispatched from the Canaries were not
yet arrived. By the unflilfulnefs of the pilots, and the vio-
lence of currents, they had been carried a hundred and ixty
miles to the weft of St. Domingo, and forced to take iheltcr
in a harbour of the province of Xaragua, where Roldan and
his fcditious followers were cantoned. Roldan carefully con-
cealed from tle commanders his in{riiredion againll the adc-

' tiouflefs, and deeds of violence were familiar; and they re-

turned eagerly to a course of life nearly resembling that to
which they had been accustomed. The commanders of the
ships perceiving, when it was too late, their imprudence in dif-
cmbarking so many of their men, flood away for St. Domingo,
and got safe into the port a few days after the admiral; but
their flock of provisions was so wafted during a voyage of such
long continuance, that they brought little relief to the co-
lony .

Coopoed BY this junaion with a band of such bold and desperate
,n th condu associates, Rollan became extremely formidable, and no less
of Columbus. extravagant in his demands. Columbus, though filled with

refentmenI at his ingratitude, and highly exasperated by the
insolence of his followers, made no haste to take the field. He
trembled at the thoughts of kindling the flames of a civil war,
in which, whatever party prevailed, the power and strength of
both must be so much wafted, as might encourage the common
enemy to unite and complete their deftrudion. At the fame
time, he observed, that the prejudices and passions which incited
the rebels to take arms, had so far infected those who still ad-
hered to him, that many of them were adverse, and all cold to
the service. From such sentiments, with refpet to the public
interest, as well as from this view of his own situation, he
chore to negociate rather than to fight. By a seasonable procla-
mation, offering free pardon to such as should merit it by re-
turning to their duty, he made imprcflion upon ome of the

tunate adventurers, who, from sickness and disappointment, '49'
were disgusted with the country. By promising to re-eftablilh
Roldan in his former office, lie soothed his pride; and by
complying with most of his demands in behalf of his followers,
lie satisfied their avarice. Thus, gradually and without blood-
shed, but after many tedious negociations, he difrolvcd this
dangerous combination which threatened the colony with ruin;
and restored the appearance of order, regular government, and
tranquillity Y.

IN consequence of this agreement with the mutineers, lands A new modle

were allotted them in different parts of the ifand, and the In- ,,lt,'"'
dians fettled in each difirid were appointed to cultivate a cer-
tain portion of ground for the use of those new maflers. The /499.
performance of this work was fubflituted in place of the tribute
formerly imposed ; and how neceflary soever filch a regulation
might be in a sickly and feeble colony, it introduced among the
Spaniards the Rcpartinlicntos, or difiributions of ntlilans efta-

curious or valuable produtions which he had acquired by traf-

They excited a generous emulation to surpass his performances, '-
and an ardent desire to make ome reparation to their country 1499.
for their own error. With this view, Emmanuel, who in-
herited the enterprising genius of his predecessors, persisted in
their grand scheme of opening a passage to the East Indies by
the Cape of Good Hope; and soon after his acceflion to the
throne, equipped a squadron for that important voyage. He
gave the 'command of it to Vasco de Gama, a man of noble
birth, possessed of virtue, prudence, and courage, equal to
the station. The squadron, like all those fitted out for dif-
covery in the infancy of navigation, was extremely feeble,
consisting only of three vessels, of neither burden nor force ade-
quate to the service. As the Europeans were at that time
little acquainted with the course of the trade-winds and pe-
riodical monsoons, which render navigation in the Atlantic
ocean, as well as in the ea that separates Africa from India, at
some seasons easy, and at others not only dangerous, but alrnoft
impraticable, the time chosen for Gama's departure was the
most improper during the whole year. He fct fail from Lisbon
on the ninth of July, and sanding towards the south, had to '+97.
flruggle for four months with contrary winds, before he could
reach the Cape of Good Hope. Here their violence began to Nov. 20.
abate; and during an interval of calm weather, Gama doubled
that formidable promontory, which had so long been the boun-
dary of navigation, and direCted his course towards the north-
cast, along the African coast. IIe touched at fcvcral ports; and
after various adventures, which the lPortugucfe hiflorians re-

inhabitants of Europe no less in their features and complexion,
than in their manners and inflitutions. As they advanced from
this, they observed, to their inexprefible joy, that the human
form gradually altered and improved, the Asiatic features began
to predominate, marks of civilization appeared, letters were
known, the Mahometan religion was established, and a com-
merce, far from being inconsiderable, was carried on. At that
time several vessels fiom India were in the port of Melinda.
Gama now pursued his voyage with almost absolute certainty
of success, and, under the conduct of a Mahometan pilot, ar-
rived at Calecut, upon the coal of Malabar, on the twenty-
second of May one thousand four hundred and ninety-eight.
What hebeheld of the wealth, the populousness, the cultivation,
the induflry and arts of this highly civilized country, far fur-
passed any idea that he had formed, from the imperfeCt ac-

as he possessed neither sufficient force to attempt a settlement,
nor proper commodities with which he could carry on commerce
of any consequence, he halened back to Portugal, with an ac-
count of his success in performing a voyage the longest, as well
as most difficult, that had ever been made since the firIt inven-
tion of navigation. He landed at Lisbon on the fourteenth of

globe, than in all the ages which had elapsed previous to that Br 0 K
period. The spirit of discovery, feeble at firfi and cautious,
moved within a very narrow sphere, and made its efforts with 14'9
hesitation and timidity. Encouraged by success, it became ad-
venturous, and boldly extended its operations. In the course
of its progression, it continued to acquire vigour, and advanced
at length with a rapidity and force which burst through all the
limits within which ignorance and fear had hitherto circum-
fcribed the activity of the human race. Almost fifty years were
employed by the Portuguese in creeping along the coast of
Africa from Cape Non to Cape de Verd, the latter of which
lies only twelve degrees to the south of the former. In lss than
thirty years they ventured beyond the equinoctial line into
another hemisphere, and penetrated to the southern extremity
of Africa, at the distance of forty-nine degrees from Cape de
Verd. During the last seven years of the century, a New World
was discovered in the weft, not inferior in extent to all the
parts of the earth with which mankind were at that time ac-
quainted. In the east, unknown eas and countries were found
out, and a communication, long desired, but hitherto con-
ccaled, was opened between Europe and the opulent regions of
India. In comparison with events so wonderful and unexpeced,
all that had hitherto been deemed great or splendid, faded
away and disappeared. Vast objects now presentcd themfclves.
The human mind, rouzed and interetfed by the profpea, en-
gaged with ardour in pursuit of them, and exerted its aive
powers in a new direction.

THIS spirit of entcrprife, though but newly awakened in Difrovies

caied on in

Spain, began soon to operate cxtcnfivcly. All the attempts Sp:in by pri.
towards discovery made in that kingdom, had hitherto been ";,rc advc"n

U 2 carried

B 0 0 K carried on by Columbus alone, and at the expence of the fob
a-_-J- vereign. But now private adventurers, allured by the magni-

ficent descriptions he gave of the regions which he had
visited, as well as by the specimens of their wealth which he
produced, offered to fit out squadrons at their own risk, and to
go in quest of new countries. The Spanish court, whose scanty
revenues were exhausted by the charge of its expeditions to the
New World, which, though they opened val prospects of fu-
ture benefit, yielded a very sparing return of present profit,
was extremely willing to devolve the burden of discovery upon
its fubjeds. It seized with joy an opportunity of rendering the
avarice, the ingenuity, and efforts of projectors, infirumental
in promoting designs of certain advantage to the public, though
Ojeda the firR of doubtful success with refped to themselves. One of the first

ofthf. propositions of this kind was made by Alonfo de Ojeda, a gal-

lant and ative officer, who had accompanied Columbus in his
second voyage. His rank and character procured him such
credit with the merchants of Seville, that they undertook to
equip four hips, provided he could obtain the royal licence,
authorising the voyage. The powerful patronage of the bilhop
of Badajos easily fccured success in a suit so agreeable to the
court. Without consulting Columbus, or regarding the rights
and jurifdition which he had acquired by the capitulation in
one thousand four hundred and ninety-two, Ojeda was per-
mnitted to set out for the New World. In order to direc his
course, the bilhop communicated to him the admiral's journal
of his lait voyage, and his charts of the countries which he had
My. discovercd. Ojeda firuck out into no new path of navigation,

but adhering Icrvilely to the route which Columbus had taken,
arrived on the coall of Paria. He traded with the natives, and
handing to the weft, proceeded as far as Cape de Vela, and

quired such authority among his companions, that they wil-
lingly allowed him to have a chief share in direting their opc-
rations during the voyage. Soon after his return, he tranf-
mitted an account of his adventures and discoveries to one of
his countrymen; and labouring with the vanity of a traveller
to magnify his own exploits, he had the address and confidence
to frame his narrative, so as to make it appear that he had the
glory of having first discovered the continent in the New World.
Amerigo's account was drawn up not only with art, but with
some elegance. It contained an amusing hiflory of his voyage,
and judicious observations upon the natural produEions, the
inhabitants, and the customs of the countries which he had
visited. As it was the firfi dcfcription of any part of the New
World that was publihncd, a performance so well calculated to
gratify the passion of mankind for what is new and marvellous,
circulated rapidly, and was read with admiration. 'lie coun-

enterprise into Spain, but all the first adventurers who diftin-
guifhed themselves in this new career, were formed by his in-
ftructions, and acquired in his voyages the skill and informa-
tion which qualified them to imitate his example. Alonfo
Nigno, who had served under the admiral in his last expedition,
fitted out,' in conjuncion with Christopher Guerra, a merchant
of Seville, a ingle hip, and failed to the coals of Paria. This
voyage seems to have been conduced with greater attention to

tugal to fit out a fleet so powerful, as not only to carry on trade,
but to attempt conquest, he gave the command of it to Pedro
Alvarez Cabral. In order to avoid the coast of Africa, where
he was certain of meeting with variable breezes, or frequent
calms, which might retard his voyage, Cabral flood out to ea,
and kept so far to the weft, that, to his surprise, he found him-
self upon the hore of an unknown country, in the tenth degree
beyond the line. He imagined, at first, that it was ome island
in the Atlantic ocean hitherto unobserved; but, proceeding
along its coast for several days, he was led gradually to believe,
that a country ol extensive formed a part of tome great conti-

RMal1hiintion5 WHILE the Spaniards and Portuguese, by those successive
;Ig.linf Co.
lumbus. voyages, were daily acquiring more enlarged ideas of the extent

and opulence of that quarter of the globe which Columbus had
made known to them, he himself, far from enjoying the tran-
quillity and honours with which his services hould have been
recompenfed, was struggling with every difirefs in which the
envy ana malevolence of the people under his command, or the
ingratitude of the court which he served, could involve him.
Though the pacification with Roldan broke the union and
weakened the force of the mutineers, it did not extirpate the
feeds of discord out of the island. Several of the malcontents
continued in arms, refusing to submit to the admiral. He
and his brothers were obliged to take the field alternately, in
order to check their incursions, or to punish their crimes. The
perpetual occupation and disquiet which this created, prevented
him from giving due attention to the dangerous machinations
of his enemies in the court of Spain. A good number of those
who were most dissatisficd with his adminifiration, had em-
braced the opportunity of returning to Europe with the flips
which he dispatched from St. Domingo. The final disappoint-

teazed Ferdinand and Isabella incessantly with memorials, con-
taining the detail of their own grievances, and the articles of
their charge againfl Columbus. Whenever either the king or
queen appeared in public, they surrounded them in a tumul-
tuary manner, infifling with importunate clamours for payment
of the arrears due to them, and demanding vengeance upon
the author of their sufferings. They insulted the admiral's
sons wherever they met them, reproaching them as the off-
spring of the projector, whose fatal curiosity had discovered
those pernicious regions which drained Spain of its wealth, and
would prove the grave of its people. Those avowed endeavours
of the malcontents from America to ruin Columbus, were fe-
conded by the secret, but more dangerous insinuations of that
party among the courtiers, which had always thwarted his
schemes, and envied his success and credit ".

totally disregarded. Ferdinand confidered Spain, on this ac-
count, as a loser by the enterprise of Columbus, and imputed
it to his mifcondua and incapacity for government, that a
country abounding in gold had yielded nothing of value to its
conquerors. Even Isabella, who, from the favourable opinion
which fle entertained of Columbus, had uniformly proteted
him, was shaken at length by the number and boldness of his
accusers, and began to fufpet that a difaffetion so general
must have been occasioned by real grievances, which called for

them.

to Hispaniola, with full powers to inquire into the conduct of
Columbus, and, if he found the charge of mal-adminiftlation
proved, to fuperfe(le him, and aflime the government of the
island. It was impossible to escape condemnation, when this
prcpoflcrous commiflion made it the intcrcft of the judge to find

bus had now composed all the lillentions in the iflanld; thougl

quired all persons to acknowledge him as fuprcme governor ; lie
set at liberty the prisoners confined by tlhe admiral, and lum-
moned him to appear before his tribunal, in order to anfwecr
for his condut; tranfinicting to him, together with the fiun-
mons, a copy of the royal mandate, by which Columbus was
enjoined to yield implicit obedience to his commands.

COLUMBUS, though deeply affeQed with the ingratitude Coltmlntis

and injustice of Ferdinand and Isabella, did not hesitate a mo- to'q;11i'. 5
ment about his own conduct. He fuibmitted to the will of his
sovereigns with a refpedful silence, and repaired (lirely to the
court of that violent and partial judge whom tlihe had autho-
rifed to try him. Bovadilla, without admitli'.- him into his
preltnce, ordered him infantly to be arrelctl, to e loaded with
chains, and hurried on board a lip. Even under this rnmi- oo!cr.

1'00' their indigence or crimes had impelled to abandon their native

country, expressid the mcft indecent fatisfacion with the dif-
grace and impriobnment of Columbus. They flattered them-
J'lves, that now they flould enjoy an uncontrouled liberty,
more suitable to their difofition and former habits of life.
Among persons thus prepared to censure the proceedings, and
to asperse the character of Columbus, Bovadilla colleted ma-
terials for a charge against him. All accusations, the molt
improbable as well as inconfillent, were received. No in-
former, however infamous, was rejeded. The result of this
inqucft, no less indecent than partial, he tranfinitted to Spain.
At the fame time, he ordered Columbus, with his two brothers,
to be carried thither in fetters; and, adding cruelty to insult,
he confined them in different ships, and excluded them from
the comfort of that friendly intercourse which might have
toothed their common diflrefs. But while the Spaniards in
Hispaniola viewed the arbitrary and insolent proceedings of
3ovadilla with a general approbation, which reflects dishonour
upon their name and country, one man still retained the me-
mory of the great adions which Columbus had performed, a.id
was touched with the fentinents of veneration and pity due to
his rank, his age, and his merit. Alonfo de Vallejo, the cap-
tain of the vessel on board which the admiral was confined, as
loon as he was clear of the iland, approached his prisoner with
great refped, and offered to rclcafe him from the fetters with
which he was unjuflly loaded. " No," replied Columbus, with
a generous indignation, " I wear there irons in consequence of

Set at liberty,

As soon as Ferdinand and Ifabclla were informed that Colum- but deprived
bus was brought home a prisoner, and in chains, they perceived ofall atl. o
at o;nce what univcrfal afioniflment this event muff occasion,
and what an inpreflion to their disadvantage it must make.
All Europe, they foresaw, would be filled with indignation at
this ungenerous requital of a man who had performed ations
worthy of the highest recompence, and would exclaim againfl
the injuflice of the nation, to which he had been such an emi-
nent benefactor, as well as againfl the ingratitude of the
princes whose reign he had rendered illuflrious. Ashamcd of
their own condud, and eager not only to make some reparation
for this injury, but to efface the slain which it might fix upon
their characer, they instantly issued orders to set Columbus at Dec. 1'7
liberty, invited him to court, and remitted money to enable
him to appear there in a manner suitable to his rank. When
he entered the royal presence, Columbus threw himself at the
feet of his sovereigns. Ile remained for some time silent; the
various paflions which agitated his mind fupprcffing his power
of utterance. At length he recovered himself, and vindicated
his condud in a long discourse, producing the molf satisfying
proofs of his own integrity as well as good intention, and evi-
dence, no less clear, of the malevolence of his enemies, wlio,
not satisfied with having ruined his fortune, laboured to de-
prive him of what alone was now lcft, his honour and his faime.
Ferdinand received him with decent civility, and Tillbclla with

iI.
c-- ' what had happened, disavowed their knowledge of it, and joined
'500 in promising him proteCtion and future favour. But though

they instantly degraded Bovadilla, in order to remove from
themselves any suspicion of having authorised his violent pro-
ceedings, they did not restore to Columbus his jurifdidion and
privileges as viceroy of those countries which he had discovered.
Though willing to appear the avengers of Columbus's wrongs,
that illiberal jcaloufy which prompted them to invest Bovadilla
with such authority as put it in his power to treat the admiral
with indignity flill fubfifled. They were afraid to trutf a man
to whom they were so highly indebted, and retaining him at
court under various pretexts, they appointed Nicholas de Ovan-
do, a knight of the military order of Alcantara, governor of
Hifpaniol k.

COLUMBUS was deeply affeCted with this new injury, which

came from hands that seemed to be employed in making repa-
ration for his past sufferings. The fcnfibility with which great
minds feel every thing that implies any suspicion of their inte-
grity, or that wears the asped of an affront, is exquisite. Co-
lumbus had experienced both fiom the Spaniards ; and their
ungenerous conduCt exafpcrated him to fulch a degree, that he
could no longer conceal the fcntinents which it excited.
Wherever hc went, he carried about with him, as a memorial
of tlcir ingratitude, those fetters with which lie had been
loaded. They were conflantly hung up in his clhambcr, and
he gave orders that when lie died they flould be buried in his
grave'.

MEANWhIILE,

MEANWHILE, the spirit of discovery, notwitliflanding the B o0 O

severe check which it received by the ungenerous treatment of --
the man, who firfl excited it in Spain, continued aive and vi- 1;'ivr) sos
gorous. Roderigo di Baftidas, a person of diftinLion, fitted out di Cv'ly-
two ships in co-partnery with John de la Cosa, who having Jalluiry.
served under the admiral in two of his voyages, was deemed the
most skilful pilot in Spain. They fleered dircLly towards the
continent, arrived on the coast of Paria, and proceeding to the
weft, discovered all the coast of the province now known by the
name of Terra Firma, from Cape de Vela to the gulf of Darien.
Not long after Ojeda, with his former afociate Amerigo Ve-
fpucci, set out upon a second voyage, and being unacquainted
with the destination of Baftidas, held the fame course, and
touched at the fame places. The voyage of Baflidas was pro-
fperous and lucrative, that of Ojeda unfortunate. But both
tended to increase the ardour of discovery; for in proportion as
the Spaniards acquired a more extensive knowledge of the Ame-
rican continent, their idea of its opulence and fertility in-
creased .

BEFORE these adventurers returned from their voyages, a Ovandoap-

pointed go-

flet was equipped, at the public expence, for carrying over vernor of
Ovando, the new governor, to Hilfpaniola. His prelence there ilil'"ni'"'l
was extremely requisite, in order to flop the inconfidlerate ca-
reer of Bovadilla, whose imprudent administration threatened
the fcttlement witih ruin. Conscious of the violence and ini-
quity of his proceedings against Columbus, le continued to
make it his sole ol)je: to gain the favour and support of his
countrymen, by accommodating himlilf to their pallions and

B o K prejudices. With this view, he established regulations, in

a-_~ every point the reverse of those which Columbus deemed effen-
;) ' tial to the prosperity of the colony. Instead of the evere dif-

cipline, necessary in order to habituate the dissolute and cor-
rupted members of which the society was composed, to the
restraints of law and subordination, he fiffered them to enjoy
such uncontrouied licence, as encouraged the wildest excesses.
Instead of protecing the Indians, he gave a legal fancion to
the oppression of that unhappy people. He took the exaa
number of such as survived their past calamities, divided them
into diftinc classes, distributed them in property among his
adherents, and reduced all the people of the iland to a state of
complete servitude. As the avarice of the Spaniards was too
rapacious and impatient to try any method of acquiring wealth
but that of searching for gold, this servitude became as grievous
as it was "unjust. The Indians were driven in crowds to the
mountains, and compelled to work in the mines by mailers,
who imposed their talks without mercy or discretion. Labour,
so disproportioned to their strength and former habits of life,
wafled that feeble race of men, with such rapid consumption, as
must have oon terminated in the utter extincion of the ancient
inhabitants of the country ".

with this powerful reinforcement to the colony, Bovadilla re- B 0 0 K
signed his charge, and was commanded to return inflantly to -- .I
Spain, in order to answer for his condu&. Roldan, and the
other ringleaders of the mutineers, who had been mol aive in
opposing Columbus, were required to leave tle island at the
fame time. A proclamation was ifucd, declaring tle natives to
be free fubjets of Spain, of whom no service was to be exacted
contrary to their own inclination, and without paying them an
adequate price for their labour. With refpe&t to the Spaniards
themselves, various regulations were made, tending to suppress
the licentious spirit which had been so fatal to the colony, and
to establish that reverence for law and order on which society
is founded, and to which it is indebted for its increase and
flability. In order to limit the exorbitant gain which private
persons were supposed to make by working the mines, an ordi-
nance was published, direcing all the gold to be brought to a
public fmelting-houfe, and declaring one half of it to be the
property of the crown .

t--.-- value, made Ferdinand confider the concessions in the capitula-

02 tion as extravagant and impolitic. He was afraid of entrusting

a subjed with the exercise of a jurifdidion that now appeared to
be so extremely extensive, and might grow to be no less formid-
able. He inspired Isabella with the fame suspicions; and under
various pretexts, equally frivolous and unjust, they eluded all
Columbus's requisitions to perform that which a solemn treaty
bound them to accomplish. After attending the court of Spain
for near two years, as an humble suitor, he found it impossible
to remove Ferdinand's prejudices and apprehensions; and per-
ceived, at length, that he laboured in vain, when he urged
a claim of justice or merit with an interested and unfeeling
prince.

He fornm BUT ven this ungenerous return did not discourage him from
new chemnes
ofdicovery. pursuing the great object which first called forth his inventive

genius, and excited him to attempt discovery. To open a
new paflage to the Eafl Indies was his original and favourite
scheme. This ill engrosscd his thoughts ; and either from his
own ob)servations in his'voyage to Paria, or from ome obfcurc
hint of the natives, or from the accounts given by Baftidas and
de la Colh, of tlicr expedition, he conceived an opinion that,
beyond the continent of America, there was a sea which ex-
tcnded to the East Indies, and hoped to find some strait or nar-
row neck of land, by which a comlnunication might be opened
with it and the part of the ocean already known. By a very
fortunate conjccture, he supposed this strait or isthmus to be
situatcd near the gulf of Darien. Full of this idea, though
he was now of an advanced age, worn out with fatigue, and
broken with infirmities, he offered, with the alacrity of a

youthful

youthful adventurer, to undertake a voyage which would afcer- B I00 K
tain this important point, and perfect the grand cheme which -- -
from the beginning he proposed to accomplish. Several cir- IOZ
cumfiances concurred in disposing Ferdinand and Ilabella to
lend a favourable ear to this proposal. They were glad to
have the pretext of any honourable employment for removing
from court a man with whose demands they deemed it impo-
litic to comply, and whose services it was indecent to neglect.
Though unwilling to reward Columbus, they were not insen-
fible of his merit, and from their experience of his skill and
conduc, had reason to give credit to his conjectures, and to
confide in his success. To there considerations, a third must
be added of still more powerful influence. About this time
the Portuguese fleet, under Cabral, arrived from the Indies;
and, by the richness of its cargo, gave the people of Europe a
more perfect idea, than they had hitherto been able to form,
of the opulence and fertility of the east. The Portuguese had
been more fortunate in their discoveries than the Spaniards.
They had opened a communication with countries where in-
duftry, arts, and elegance flourished; and where commerce had
been longer established, and carried to greater extent than in
any region of the earth. Their first voyages thither yielded
immediate, as well as vast returns of profit, in commodities
extremely precious and in great request. Lisbon became im-
mediately the feat of commerce and of wealth ; while Spain
had only the expectation of remote benefit, and of future gain,
from the weftcrn world. Nothing, then, could be more ac-
ceptable to the Spaniards than Columbus's offer to conduct them
to the east, by a route which he expected to be Illorter, as well
as lets dangerous, than that which the Portugucfe had taken.

voyge tion, Columbus could procure only four finall barks, the largest

of which did not exceed seventy tons in burden, for performing
it. Accuftornd to brave danger, and to engage in arduous
undertakings with inadequate force, he did not hesitate to ac-
cept the command of this pitiful squadron. His brother Bar-
tholomew, and his second son Ferdinand, the hiflorian of his
ations, accompanied him. He failed from Cadiz on the ninth
of May, and touched, as usual, at the Canary Islands; from
thence he purposed to have flood directly for the continent;
but his largest vessel was so clumsy and unfit for service, as con-
strained him to bear away for Hispaniola, in hopes of exchan-

When he arrived off St. Domingo, he found eighteen of
these ships ready loaded, and on the point of departing for
Spain. Columbus immediately acquainted the governor with
the destination of his voyage, and the accident which had
obliged him to alter his route. He requested permiflion to
enter the harbour, not only that he might negociate the ex-
change of his lhip, but that he might take fleltcr during a
violent hurricane, of which he discerned the approach from
various prognoflics, which his experience and sagacity had
taught him to olfcrrve. On that account, he adviscd him like-
wife to put off for ome days the departure of the fleet bound
for Spain. But Ovando rcfufcd his request, and dcfrifcdl his
counsel. Under circumflalccs in which humanity would have
aflordcd refuge to a itranger, Coluinbus was denied admittance

acquired the possession. His salutary warning, which merited --
the greatest attention, was regarded as the dream of a visionary 2
prophet, who arrogantly pretended to predic an event beyond
the reach of human foresight. The fleet set fail for Spain.
Next night the hurricane came on with dreadful impetuosity.
Columbus, aware of the danger, took precautions against it,
and saved his little squadron. The fleet deifined for Spain
met with the fate which the rashness and obstinacy of its com-
manders dcferved. Of eighteen fllips two or three only
escaped. In this general wreck perished Bovadilla, loldan,
and the greater part of those who had been the mofl aive
in persecuting Columbus, and oppressing the Indians. Toge-
ther with themselves, all the wealth which they had acquired
by their injustice and cruelty was swallowed up. It exceeded
in value two hundred thousand pesos ; an immense fum at that
period, and sufficient not only to have screened them fiom any
severe scrutiny into their conduct, but to have fccurcd them a
gracious reception in the Spanish court. Among the nhips
that escaped, one had on board all the effecs of Colurliin;s

pailgei o the After a tedious and dangerous voyage, he discovered Guanaia,

an ifand not far distant from the coast of Honduras. There
he had an interview with some inhabitants of the continent,
who arrived in a large canoe. They appeared to be a people
more civilized, and who had made greater progress in the
knowledge of useful arts, than any whom he had hitherto dif-
covered. In return to the inquiries which the Spaniards made,
with their usual eagerness, concerning the places where the
Indians., got the gold which they wore by way of ornament,
they direced them to countries situated to the weft, in which
gold was found in such profusion, that it was applied to the
most common uses. Inflead of fleering in quest of a country
so inviting, which would have conducted him along the coast
of Yucatan to the rich empire of Mexico, Columbus was so
bent upon his favourite scheme of finding out that strait which
communicated with the Indian ocean, that he bore away to
the earl towards the gulf of Darien. In this navigation he
di'covered all the coast of the continent, from Cape Gracias a
Dios, to a harbour which, on account of its beauty and fecu-
rity, he called Porto Bello. He searched, in vain, for the
imaginary strait, through which he expeced to make his way
into an unknown sea; and though he went on hore fcveral
times, and advanced into the country, he did not penetrate so

ceived such an idea of its wealth, from the specimens of gold
produced by the natives, that he resolved to leave a small colony
upon the river Belem, in the province of Veragua, under the
command of his brother, and to return himfclf to Spain, in
order to procure what was requisite for rendering the eltablifh- 1503.

under his command, deprived Columbus of the glory of plant-
ing the first colony on the continent of America. Their info-
lence and rapaciousness provoked the natives to take arms, and
as there were a more hardy and warlike race of men than the
inhabitants of the islands, they cut off part of the Spaniards,
and obliged the reft to abandon a Rfation which was found to be
untenable .

;103. and were so much ibattered by the shock, that with the utmost
Junea. dificulty they reached Jamaica, where he was obliged to run

them aground, to prevent them fiom finking. The measure
of his calamities seemed now to be full. He was cars ahore
upon an island at a considerable diflance from the only fettle-
ment of the Spaniards in America. His ships were ruined
beyond the poflibility of being repaired. To convey an account
of his situation to Hispaniola, appeared impracticable; and
without this it was vain to expec relief. Iis genius, fertile in
resources, and most vigorous in those perilous extremities when
feeble minds abandon themselves to despair, discovered the only
expedient which afforded any profpec- of deliverance. He had
recourse to the hospitable kindness of the natives, who confider-
ing the Spaniards as beings of a superior nature, were eager, on
every occasion, to minister to their wants. From them he ob-
tained two of their canoes, each formed out of the trunk of a
single tree, hollowed with fire, and so mis-shapen and aukward
as hardly to merit the name of boats. In these, which were fit
only for creeping along the coast, or crofling from one bay to
another, Mendez, a Spaniard, and Fiefchi, a Genoese, two
gentlemen particularly attached to Columbus, gallantly offered
to set out for Hispaniola, upon a voyage of above thirty
leagues . This they accomplished in ten days, after surmount-
ing incredible dangers, and enduring such fatigue, that several
of the Indians who accompanied them funk under it, and died.
The attention paid to them by the governor of HIifpaniola was
neither such as their courage merited, nor the diflrefs of the
persons from whom they came, required. Ovando, from a

mean jealousy of Columbus, was afraid of allowing him to set B OIO K
his foot in the island under his government. This ungenerous
passion hardened his heart against every tender fentimcnt, which 1503.
refleCtion upon the services and misfortunes of that great man,
or compassion for his own fellow-citizens, involved in the fame
calamities, must have excited. Mendez and Ficfchi spent eight
months in soliciting relief for their commander and afociates,
without any prospeCt of obtaining it.

DURING this period, various pafions agitated the mind of Hlisdiflrci

and 'ufferings

Columbus, and his companions in adversity. At first the ex- there.
pedation of speedy deliverance, from the success of Mendez
and Fiefchi's voyage; cheered the spirits of the most desponding.
After ome time the more timorous began to fufpe that they
had miscarried in their daring attempt. At length, all con- 1504.
eluded that they had perished. The ray of hope which had
broke in upon them, made their condition appear now more
dismal. Despair, heightened by disappointment, fettled in
every breast. Their last resource had failed, and nothing re-
mained but to end their miserable days among naked savages,
far from their country and their friends. The seamen, in a
transport of rage, rose in open mutiny, threatened the life of
Columbus, whom they reproached as the author of all their
calamities, seized ten canoes, which he had purcliafcd from the
Indians, and despising his remonstrances and entreaties, made
off with them to a distant part of the island. At the fame time,
the natives murmured at the long residence of the Spaniards in
their country. As their induflry was not greater than that of
their neighbours in Hilpaniola, like them, they found the bur-
dlen of supporting so many firangers to be altogether intolerable.
They began to bring in provilions with rlucance, they fiir,

VOL. I. Z niflied

B 0 0 K nifhed them with a sparing hand, and threatened to withdraw
A- _ those supplies altogether. Such a resolution must quickly have

been fatal to the Spaniards. Their safety depended upon the
good will of the Indians; and unless they could revive the ad-
miration and reverence with which that simple people had at
firfi beheld them, deftruaion was unavoidable. Though the
licentious proceedings of the mutineers had, in a great measure,
effaced those impressions which had been so favourable to the
Spaniards, the ingenuity of Columbus fuggefled a happy arti-
fice, that not only restored but heightened the high opinion
which the Indians had originally entertained of them. By his
skill in astronomy, he knew that there was shortly to be a total
eclipse of the moon. He assembled all the principal persons of
the diftrit around him on the day before it happened, and,
after reproaching them for their fickleness in withdrawing their
affection and assistance from men whom they had lately revered,
he told them, that the Spaniards were servants of the Great
Spirit who dwells in heaven, who made and governs the
world; that he, offended at their refusing to fpport men who
were the objects of his peculiar favour, was preparing to punish
this crime with exemplary severity, and that very night the
moon should withhold her light, and appear of a bloody hue,
as a sign of the divine wrath, and an emblem of the vengeance
ready to fall upon them. To this marvellous prediction some
of them listened with the careless indifference peculiar to the
people of America; others, with the credulous altonifhment
natural to barbarians. But when the moon began gradually to
be darkened, and at length appeared of a red colour, all were
struck with terror. They ran with conflernation to their houses,
and returning instantly to Columbus loaded with provisions,.
threw them at his feet, conjuring him to intercede with the

2 Great

Great Spirit to avert the deftrution with which they were B 0 0 K
threatened. Columbus, eeming to be moved by their entrea- ---
ties, promised to comply with their desire. The eclipse went 54
off, the moon recovered its splendour, and from that day the
Spaniards were not only furnished profusely with provisions,
but the natives, with superstitious attention, avoided every
thing that could give them offence '.

DURING those tranfations, the mutineers had made repeated A cruel addi-

tion to them.

attempts to pass over to Hispaniola in the canoes which they had
seized. But, from their own mifconduc, or the violence of the
winds and currents, their efforts were all unsuccessful. Enraged
at this disappointment, they marched towards that part of the
island where Columbus remained, threatening him with new
danger and insults. While they were advancing, an event
happened, more cruel and afflicding than any calamity which
he dreaded from them. The governor of Hispaniola, whose
mind was still filled with some dark suspicions of Columbus,
sent a small bark to Jamaica, not to deliver his distressed coun-
trymen, but to spy out their condition. Left the sympathy of
those whom he employed should afford them relief, contrary to
his intention, he gave the command of this vcfiel to Efcobar,
an inveterate enemy of Columbus, who adhering to his inftruc-
tions with malignant accuracy, cafi anchor at ome diflance
from the island, approached the (lore in a small boat, obfcrved
the wretched plight of the Spaniards, delivered a letter of empty
compliment to the admiral, received his answer, and departed.
When the Spaniards firfl descried the vefl flanding towards
the island, every heart exulted, as if the long-expeclcd hour of

B O K their deliverance had at length arrived; but when it disappeared

so suddenly, they funk into the deepefi dejedtion, and all their
'50°' hopes died away. Columbus alone, though he felt molI fen-

sibly this wanton insult which Ovando added to his past neglect,
retained such composure of mind, as to be able to cheer his
followers. He assured them, that Mendez and IFiefchi had
reached Hispaniola in safety; that they would peedily procure
ships to carry them off; but as Efcobar's eflel could not take
them all on board, that he had refused to go with her, because
he was determined never to abandon the faithful companions
of his difirefs. Soothed with the expectation of speedy deliver-
ance, and delighted with his apparent generosity in attending
more to their preservation than to his own safety, their spirits
revived, and he regained their confidence .

WITHOUT this confidence, he could not have refilled the

mutineers, who were now at hand. All his endeavours to
reclaim those desperate men had no effe but to increase their
frenzy. Their demands became every day more extravagant,
and their intentions more violent and bloody. The common
safety rendered it neceirary to oppose them with open force.
Columbus, who had been long afflided with the gout, could
not take the field. His brother, the Adelantado, marched
May 2o. against them. They quickly met. The mutineers rejeced

with scorn terms of accommodation, which he once more of-
sered them, and ruflIctl on boldly to the attack. hey fell not

when the ships appeared, whose arrival Columbus had promniled
with great address, though he could soreree it with little cer-
tainty. With tranfportsofjoy, the Spaniards quitted an island
in which the unfeeling jcalouly of Ovando had fTcred tem

in whose justice, humanity, and favour, he confided as his last
resource. None now remained to redress his wrongs, or to
reward him for his services and sufferings, but Ferdinand, who
had so long opposed and so often injured him. To solicit a
prince thus prejudiced against him, was an occupation no less
irksome than hopeless. In this, however, was Columbus
doomed to employ the close of his days. As soon as his health
was in some degree re-established, he repaired to court; and
though he was received there with civility barely decent, he
plied Ferdinand with petition after petition, demanding the
punishment of his oppressors, and the reflitution of all the pri-
vileges bellowed upon him by the capitulation of one thousand
four hundred and ninety-two. Ferdinand amused him with
fair words and unmeaning promises. Inltead of granting his
claims, he proposed expedients in order to elude them, and
spun out the affair with such apparent art, as plainly discovered
his intention that it should never be terminated. The declining
health of Columbus flattered Ferdinand with the hopes of being
soon delivered from an importunate suitor, and encouraged him
to persevere in this illiberal plan. Nor was he deceived in his

several events worthy of notice happened in Hifpa-

niola. The colony there, the parent and nurse of all the sub- statSof the
sequent eflablifhments of Spain in the New World, gradually sclonyin
acquired the form of a regular and prosperous fcciety. The
humane solicitude of Isabella to protet the Indians from op-
pression, and particularly the proclamation, by which the Spa-
niards were prohibited to compel them to work, retarded, it is
true, for some time, the progress of improvement. The na-
tives, who confidered exemption from toil as supreme felicity,
lcorned every allurement and reward by which they were in-
vited to labour. The Spaniards had not a fuflicicnt number of
hands either to work the mines or to cultivate the foil. Several
of the first colonifrs, who had been accustomed to the service of
the Indians, quitted the illand, when deprived of tlofe inftu-
mcnts without which they knew not how to carry on any opc-

the exading one half of the produc of the mines as the royal
share, was found to bet a demand so exorbitant,, that no adven-
turers would engage to work them upon such terms. In order
to save the colony from ruin, Ovando ventured to relax the
1so5. rigour of the royal edits. He made a new diltribution of the

Indians among the Spaniards, and compelled them. to labour,
for. a stated time, in digging the mines, or in cultivating the
ground; but, in order to screen himself from the imputation
of having fubjeded them again to servitude, he enjoined their
masters to pay them a certain fum, as the price of their work.
He reduced the royal hare of the gold found in the mines
from the half to the third part, and oon after lowered it to a
fifth, at which it long remained. Notwithilanding lfabella's
tender concern for the good treatment of the Indians, and Ser-
dinand's eagerness to improve the royal revenue, Ovando per-
fuaded the court to approve of both there regulations'.

is in any degree similar, the means of defence bear some pro-
portion to those employed in the attack; and in this equal

and such passions roused, as exhibit mankind to view in a situ- B K
ation no less striking than interefling. It is one of the noblest -
functions of history, to observe and to delineate men at a june. '5O'
ture when their minds are most violently agitated, and all their
powers and passions are called forth. Hence the operations of
war, and the struggles between contending states, have been
deemed by hiflorians, ancient as well as modern, a capital and
important article in the annals of human actions. But in a
contest between naked savages, and one of the most warlike of
the European nations, where science, courage, and discipline on
one fide, were opposed by timidity, ignorance, and disorder on
the other, a particular detail of events would be as unpleasant
as uninftrutivc. If the simplicity and innocence of the In-
dians had inspircd the Spaniards with humanity, had softened
the pride of superiority into compassion, and had induced them
to improve the inhabitants of the New World, instead of op-
pressing them, some sudden as of violence, like the too rigo-
rous chaflifements of impatient inftrucors, might have been
related without horror. But, unfortunately, this consciousness
of superiority operated in a different manner. The Spniards
were advanced lo far beyond the natives of America in improve-
ment of every kind, that they viewed them witl contempt.
They conceived tle Americans to be beings of an inferior na-
ture, wlo were not intitled to the rights and p1rivileges of men.
In peace, they lfuiljc(ed thicm to f'crvitude. In war, tlley paid
no regard to tliole laws, which, by a tacit convention betweni
contending nations, regulate hloflility, and fIt fmne bounds to
its rage. T'hey confidered them not as mene lighting in Idcfncce

rI - ll ftinion of ranks established among them, were reduced to the
' Os' fame state of abject slavery. With such a spirit and sentiments

were hostilities carried on against the cazique of Higuey, a pro-
vince at the eastern extremity of the island. This war was
occasioned by the perfidy of the Spaniards, in violating a treaty
which they had made with the natives, and it was terminated
by hanging up the cazique, who defended his people with bra-
very so far superior to that of his countrymen, as intitled him
to a better fate b.

The cruel THE condutl of Ovando, in another part of the island, was
and treache
rous condal fill more treacherous and cruel. The province anciently nam-
ot Ovando. ed Xaragua, which extends from the fertile plain where Leo-

gane is now situated, to the western extremity of the island,

'4

was subjed to a female cazique, named Anacoana, highly re-
fpeted by the natives. She, from that partial fondness with
which the women of America were attached to the Europeans,
(the cause of which hall be afterwards explained) had always
courted the fiiendfip of the Spaniards, and loaded them with
good offices. But some of the adherents of Roldan having
fettled in her country, were so much exasperated at her endea-
vouring to reflrain their cxcefles, that they accused her of hav-
ing formed a plan to throw off the yoke, and to exterminate
the Spaniards. Ovando, though he knew well how little cre-
dit was due to such profligate men, marched, without further
inquiry, towards Xaragua, with three hundred foot and seventy
horiemen. To prevent the Indians from taking alarm at this
hoflile appearance, he gave out that his sole intention was to

visit Anacoana, to whom his countrymen had been so much B l0 K
indebted, in the molt refpedful manner, and to regulate with -
her the mode of levying the tribute payable to the king of '5S.
Spain. Anacoana, in order to receive this illustrious guest with
due honour, aflembled the principal men in her dominions, to
the number of three hundied, and advancing at the head of
these, accompanied by a vast croud of persons of inferior rank,
flhe welcomed Ovando with songs and dances, according to the
mode of the country, and conducted him to the place of her
residence. There he was feasted, for some days, with all the
kindness of simple hospitality, and amused with the games and
spectacles usual among the Americans upon occasions of mirth
and festivity. Iut, amidst the security which this inspired,
Ovando was meditating the defiruflion of his unfufpicious en-
tertainer and her fubjeas; and the mean perfidy with which
he executed this scheme, equalled his barbarity in forming it.
Under colour of exhibiting to the Indians the parade of an Eu-
ropean tournament, he advanced with his troops, in battle
array, towards the house in which Anacoana and the chiefs
who attended her were aflembled. The infantry took poflef-
sion of all the avenues which led to the village. The horsemen
encompaffd the house. These movements were the objec of
admiration without any mixture of fear, until, upon a signal
which had been concerted, the Spaniards suddenly drew their
swords, and rushed upon the Indians, defencelcs, and ato-
nilhed at an act of treachery which exceeded the conception of
undesigning men. In a moment Anacoana was fccured. All
her attendants were fcizcd and bound. Fire was set to the
house; and, without examination or conviclitn, all thclf un-
happy persons, the molt illufl ious in their own country, vcre
consumed in the flames. Anacoana was rcfcrvcd for a more

Redlu5ionof OVERAWED and humbled by this atrocious treatment of
'td i s 'cics.l their princes and nobles, who were objecs of their highest re-

verence, the people in all the provinces of Hispaniola submit-
ted, without farther refitance, to the Spanish yoke. Upon
the death of Isabella, all the regulations tending to mitigate
the rigour of their servitude were forgotten. The small gra-
tuity paid to them as the price of their labour was withdrawn;
and at the fame time the tasks imposed upon them were in-
i5c6. creased. Ovando, without any restraint, distributed Indians

among his friends in the island. Ferdinand, to whom the
queen had left by will one half of the revenue arising from the
settlements in the New World, conferred grants of a similar
nature upon his courtiers, as the least expensive mode of re-
warding their services. They farmed out the Indians, of
whom they were rendered proprietors, to their countrymen
fettled in lifpaniola; and that wretched people, being com-
pelled to labour in order to satisfy the rapacity of both, the
exacions of their opprcffors no longer knew any bounds. But,
barbarous as their policy was, and fatal to the inhabitants of
H-ispaniola, it produced, for some time, very considerable cf-
fedls. By calling forth the force of a whole nation, and x-
erting it in one diretion, the working of the mines was carried
on with amazing rapidity and fuccefi. During several years,
the gold brought into the royal finelting-houfes in Hispaniola

above a hundred thousand pounds tferling; which, if we attend -_
to the great change in the value of money since the beginning 56
of the sixteenth century to the present times, nuft appear an
immense fum. Vast fortunes were created, of a sudden, by
some. Others dissipated in oflentatious profusion, what they
acquired with facility. Dazzled by both, new adventurers
crouded to America, with the most eager impatience, to ihare
in those treasures which had enriched their countrymen; and,
notwithstanding the mortality occasioned by the unhealthiness
of the climate, the colony continued to increase '.

OVANDO governed the Spaniards with wisdom and juflice, Progrcfs of

not inferior to the rigour with which he treated the Indians.
He etablifhed equal laws, and, by executing them with impar-
tiality, accustomed the people of the colony to reverence them.
He founded several new towns in different parts of the iand,
and allured inhabitants to them, by the concefion of various
immunities. He endeavoured to turn the attention of the Spa-
niards to some branch of industry more useful than that of
searching for gold in the mines. Some flips of the fugar-canc
having been brought from the Canary ilands by way of cxpc-
rimlent, they were found to thrive with such increali in tle
rich foil and warm climate to which they ivcrc traiinflaoitcl;
that the cultivation of tlhem soon became an ol)jcl of commerce.
Extensive plantations were begunl; flgar-wol ks, which the
Spaniards called ingelio'.s, from the various machinery em-
ployed in them, were ereted, and in a few years the manu-

Political THE prudent endeavours of Ovando, to promote the welfare
regulations
ot erdinal l of the colony, were powerfully seconded by Ferdinand. The

large remittances which he received from the New World,
opened his eyes, at length, with refped to the importance of
those discoveries, which he had hitherto asseted to under-
value. Fortune, and his own address, having now extricated
him out of those difficulties in which he had been involved by
1iO7- the death of his queen, and by his disputes with his fon-in-law

about the government of her dominions , he had full leisure
to turn his attention to the affairs of America. To his provi-
dent sagacity, Spain is indebted for many of those regulations
which gradually formed that system of profound, but jealous
policy, by which she governs her dominions in the New World.
He ereded a court, distinguished by the title of the Casa de Con-
tratacion, or Board of Trade, compoed of persons eminent for
rank and abilities, to whom he committed the administration of
Arnerican affairs. This board assembled regularly in Seville, and
was investcd with a diflindt and extensive jurifdition. He gave
a regular forln to ecclcfialical government in America, by nomi-
nating archbishops, biffops, deans, together with clergymen of
fubordinatc ranks, to take charge of the Spaniards established
there, as well as of the natives, who should embrace the Chri-
flian faith. But, notwithstanding the obsequious devotion of
the Spanifi court to the Papal See, such was Ferdinand's so-
licitude to prevent any foreign power from claiming jurifdic-
tion, or acquiring influence, in his new dominions, that he

reserved to the crown of Spain the sole right of patronage to B ° ° 1
the benefices in America, and stipulated that no papal bull J---
or mandate should be promnlgated there, until it was pre-
vioufly examined and approved of by his council. With the
fame ipirit of jealousy, he prohibited any goods to be exported
to America, or any person to fettle there, without a special
licence from that council .

BUT, notwithitanding this attention to the police and wel- The number'

fare of the colony, a calamity impended which threatened its diminimies
dissolution. The original inhabitants, on whose labour the t
Spaniards in H-ispaniola depended for their prosperity, and even
their existence, wafted so falf, that the extinction of the whole
race seemed to be inevitable. When Columbus discovered Hiif-
paniola, the number of its inhabitants was computed to be at
least a million h. They were now reduced to sixty thousand in
the space of fifteen years. This consumption of the human
species, no less amazing than rapid, was the effeat of several
concurring causes. The natives of the American islands were
of a more feeble constitution than the inhabitants of the other
hcmifphere. They could neither perform the fame work, nor
endure the fame fatigue with men whose organs were of a more
vigorous conformation. The lifllecs indolence in which they
delighted to pass their days, as it was the eflf ct of their debi-
lity, contributed likewise to increase it, and rendered tlhem, fronm
habit as well as conflitution, incapable of hard labour. The
food on which they fubfiflcd, afforded little nouliflmennt
and they were accuflomed to take it in finall quanlttiis, not
sufficient to invigorate a languid frame, and render it equal to

--"---- ing to those peculiarities in the confritution of the Americans,

imposed tafls upon them so disproportioned to their strength, that
many funk under the fatigue, and ended their wretched days.
Others, prompted by impatience and despair, cut short their
own lives with a violent hand. Famine, brought on by com-
pelling such numbers to abandon the culture of their lands, in
order to labour in the mines, proved fatal to many. Diseases
of various kinds, ome occationed by the hardships to which
they were exposed, and others by their intercourse with the
Europeans, completed the desolation of the island. The Spa-
niards being thus deprived of the inflruments which they were
accustomed to employ, found it impossible to extend their im-
provements, or even to carry on the works which they had
58 halready begun. In order to provide an immediate remedy for

an evil so alarming, Ovando proposed to transport the inha-
bitants of the Lucayo islands to Hispaniola, under pretence
that they might be civilized with more facility, and inflruced
to greater advantage in the Christian religion, if they were
united to the Spanish colony, and under the immediate infpec-
tion of the missionaries fettled there. Ferdinand, deceived by
this artifice, or willing to connive at an a of violence which
policy reprelented as neceflary, gave his afent to the proposal.
Several veflels were fitted out for the Lucayos, the commanders
of which informed the natives, with whofc language they were
now well acquainted, that they came fiom a delicious country,
in which the departed( ancchtors of the Tndians resided, by whom
they were lent to invite their deccendcnts to retbrt thither, to
partake of tlhe bliss lenjoyed there by happly fpi rits. That im ple
people lillclned witll wonder and credulity ; and, fond of viliting
their relations and friends in that happy region, followed the

Spaniards with eagerness. By this artifice, above forty thousand B 0I° ;
were decoyed into Hispaniola, to share in tlc fuierings v.lichl -
were the lot of the inhabitants of that island, and to mingle their
groans and tears with thoie of that wretched race of men '

THE Spaniards had, for rome time, carried on their opera- cwvd:rco-

tions in the mines of Hispaniola with such ardor as well as ctli,' ,,:..
success, that they seemed to have engrolffed their whole atten-
tion. The spirit of discovery languished; and, since the lafl
voyage of Columbus, no enterprize of any moment had been
undertaken. But as the decrease of the Indians rendered it
impossible to acquire wealth in that island with the hame rapi-
dity as formerly, this urged them to search for new countries,
where their avarice might be gratified with more facility.
Juan Ponce de Leon, who commanded under Ovando in the
eastern diftrid of Hispaniola, passed over to the island of St.
John de Porto Rico, which Columbus had discovered in his
second voyage, and penetrated into-the interior part of the
country. As he fbund the foil to be fertile, and expected,
from some symptoms, as well as from the information of the
inhabitants, to discover mines of gold in the mountains, Ovan-
do permitted him to attempt making a settlement in the
island. This was easily effectd by an officer cminent for con-
dut no less than for courage. In a few years Porto Rico was
fubjceled to the Spanifl government, the natives were reduced
to servitude; and, being treated with the fame inconfidcrate ri-
gour as thcir neighbours in fHlifaniola, the race of original
inhabitants, worn out with fatigue and fuffcrings, was fbon

1) 2 ABOUT

B °0 K ABOUT the fame time, Juan Diaz de Solis, in conjunction

with Vincent Yanez Pinzon, one of Columbus's original com-
panions, made a voyage to the continent. They held the fame
course which Columbus had taken, as far as to the island of
Guanaios; but, sanding from thence to the weft, they dif-
covered a new and extensive province, afterwards known by
the name of Yucatan, and proceeded a considerable way along
the coast of that country', Though nothing memorable oc-
curred in this voyage, it deserves notice, because it led to dif-
coveries of greater importance. For the fame reason, the
voyage of Sebastian -de Ocampo must be mentioned. By the
command of Ovando, he failed round Cuba, and first dif-
covered, with certainty, that this country, which Columbus
once supposed to be a part of the continent, was a large
island

profits which descended to him by inheritance, in consequence
of the original capitulation of his father. But if there dig-
.nities and revenues appeared so considerable to Ferdinand, that,
at the expence of being deemed unjust as well as ungrateful, he
had wrested them from Columbus, it is not surprising that he
thould be unwilling to confer them on his son. Accordingly,
Don Diego wafted two years in incefrant but fruitless impor-
tunity. Weary of this, lie endcavoured at length to obtain by

the capitulation. Even after this decree, Ferdinand's repug-
nance to put a subjet in possession of such extensive rights,
might have thrown in new obstacles, if Don Diego had not
taken a ftep which interested very powerful persons in the fuc-
cess of his claims. The sentence of the council of the Indies
gave him a title to a rank so elevated, and a fortune so opulent,
that he found no difficulty in concluding a marriage with
Donna Maria, daughter of Don Ferdinand de Toledo, great
commendator of Leon, and brother of the duke of Alva, a
nobleman of the firit rank, and nearly related to the king. The
duke and his family espoused so warmly the cause of their new
ally, that Ferdinand could not -resist their solicitations. He Iso;.
recalled Ovando, and appointed Don Diego his successor,
though, even in conferring this favour, he could not conceal
his jealousy; for he allowed him to assume only the title of go-
vernor, not that of viceroy, which had been adjudged to belong
to him".

DON Diego quickly repaired to Hispaniola, attended by his IHe repairs to

persons of both sexes, born of good families. He lived with a

5 9' grated to America, and many of the most illufirious families in

the Spanifli settlements are descended from the persons who at
that time accompanied Don Diego Columbus .

No benefit accrued to the unhappy natives from this change

of governors. Don Diego was not only authorised by a royal
edi& to continue the repartimientos, or difiribution of Indians,
but the particular number which he might grant to every per-
son, according to his rank in the colony, was specified. He
availed himself of that permission; and soon after he landed at
St. Domingo, he divided such Indians as were fill unappro-
priated, among his relations and attendants'.

Pearl fishery THE Next care of the new governor was to comply with an
f Cbagua. inflruction which he received from the king, about fettling a

colony in Cubagua, a small island which Columbus had dif-
covered in his third voyage. Though this barren spot hardly
yielded fublfilence to its wretched inhabitants, such quantities
of those oyflers which produce pearls were found on its coafr,
that it did not long escape the inquisitive avarice of the Spa-
niards, and became a place of cnfiderable retort. Large for-
tunes were acquired by the fishery of pearls, which was carried
on with extraordinary ardour. The Indians, especially those
from the Lucayo islands, were compelled to dive for them; and
this dangerous and unhealthy employment was an additional
calamity, which contributed not a little to the extindion of that

devoted race .

ABOUT

ABOUr this period, Juan Diaz de Solis and Pinzon set out, B OK

in conjuncion, upon a second voyage. They flood direcly ---
south, towards the equinocial line, which Pinzon had for- N.w'vo;ges.
merly crossed, and adv.'ii:ed as far as the fortieth degree of
Ibuthern latitude. They were aflonifhed to find that the con-
tinent of America firetched, on their right hand, through all
this vast extent of ocean. They landed in different places, to
take pofTeffion in name of their sovereign; but though the
country appeared to be extremely fertile and inviting, their
force was fb finall, having been fitted out rather for discovery
than making settlements, that they left no colony behind them.
Their voyage served, however, to give the Spaniards more
exalted and adequate ideas with refped to the dircnfions of
this new quarter of the glober.

THOUGH it was above ten years since Columbus had dif- A settlement

on the conti-

covered the main land of America, the Spaniards had hitherto nent tterpt-
made no settlement in any part of it. What had been so long ed.
neglected was now seriously attempted, and with considerable
vigour, though the plan for this purpose was neither formed
by the crown, nor executed at the expence of the nation, but
carried on by the enterprising spirit of private adventurers.
This scheme took its rife from Alonfo de Ojcda, who had al-
ready made two voyages as a difcovcrer, by which he acquired
considerable reputation, but no wealth. But his characer for
intrepidity and conduct cafily procured him aflociatcs, who
advanced the money rcquilite to defray the charges of the ex-
pedition. About the me time, Diego dc Nicuefla, who iad
acquired a large fortune in Ililjaniala, forimed a imilar dctign.

\---' He ereced two governments on the continent, one extending

3509' from Cape de Vela to the gulf of Darien, and the other from

that to Cape Gracias a Dios. The former was given to Ojeda,
the latter to Nicuefia. Ojeda fitted out a ship and two brigan-
tines, with three hundred men; Nicueffa, fix veflels, with
seven hundred and eighty mcn. They failed about the fame
time from St. Domingo for their refpetive governments. In
order to give their title to those countries some appearance of
validity, several of the most eminent divines and lawyers in
Spain were employed to prescribe the mode in which they
lhould take pofeflion of them'. There is not in the history of
mankind any thing more singular or extravagant than the form
which they devised for this purpose. They inftruded those
invaders, as soon as they landed on the continent, to declare
to the'natives the principal articles of the ChriRian faith; to
acquaint them, in particular, with the supreme jurifdicion of
the Pope over all the kingdoms of the earth; to inform them
of the grant which this holy pontiff had made of their country
to the king of Spain ; to require them to embrace the doctrines
of that religion which the Spaniards made known to them;
and to submit to the sovereign whose authority they proclaimed.
If the natives refused to comply with this requisition, the terms
of which must have been utterly incomprehensible to an un-
inftrucd Indian, then Ojeda and NicuefTa were authorised to
attack them with sword and fire; to reduce them, their wives
and children, to a slate of servitude; and to compel them by
force to rccognize the jurifdlicion of the church, and the autho-
rity of the monarch, to which they would not voluntarily sub-
jcd thcmfclves'.

foreign priefr, of whom they had never heard, could have any
right to dispose of their country, or how an unknown prince
should claim jurisdiction over them as his fulljes; they fiercely
opposed the new invaders of their territories. Ojeda and Ni-
cuefla endcavoured to effec by force what they could not ac-
complifli by persuasion. The contemporary writers enter into
a very minute detail in relating their tranfastions; but as they
made no difcovcry of importance, nor eflablilhed any permanent
settlement, their adventures are not intitled to any considerable
place in the general hiflory of a period, where romantic va-
lour, firuggling witlh incredible hardships, dillinguifil every
effort of the Spanish arms. They found the natives in those
countries of which they went to aflume the government, to
be of a character very different from that of their countrymen
in the islands. They were fierce and warlike. Their ar-
rows were dipped in a poison so noxious, that every wound
was followed with certain death. In one encounter they
flew above seventy of Ojeda's followers, and the Spaniards,
for the firlt time, were taught to dread the inhabitants of
the New \orld. Nicucfla was opposed by people equally
resolute in defence of their pofcflcions. Nothing could foftcn
their ferocity. Though lhe Spaniards employed every art
to soothe them, and to gain their confidence, they refused to
hold any intercourfc, or to exchange any fiiendly officc, with
men whoe residence amonl tl them ty conlllidered as fatal to
their liberty and independence. This implacable cnmity of

'5I0' by the superiority of their arms, and their skill in the art of

war. But every disaster which can be accumulated upon the
unfortunate, combined to complete their ruin. The loss of
their fiips by various accidents upon an unknown coast, the
difafes peculiar to a climate the most noxious in all America,
the want of provisions, unavoidable in a country imperfecly
cultivated, diflention among themselves, and the incelfant hofli-
lities of the natives, involved them in a fucceflion of calamities,
the bare recital of which frikes one with horror. Though they
received two considerable reinforcements from Hispaniola, the
greater part of those who had engaged in this unhappy expe-
dition, perilied, in less than a year, in the molt extreme misery.
A'sew who survived, fettled as a feeble colony at Santa Maria
el Antigua, on the gulf of Darien, under the command of
Vasco Nugnez de Balboa, who, in the most desperate exigencies,
displayed such courage and conduct, as first gained the confi-
dence of his countrymen, and marked him out as their leader
in more splendid and successful undertakings. Nor was he the
only adventurer in this expedition who will appear with luflre
in more important scenes. Francisco Pizarro was one of Ojeda's
companions, and in this school of adversity acquired or im-
proved the talents which fitted him for the extraordinary accions
which he afterwards performed. Hernan Cortes, whose
name became still more famous, had engaged early in this en-
tcrprilc, which rouzed all the aive youth of Hispaniola to
arms; but the good fortune that accompanied him in his
fublcquent adventures, interposed to save him from the difafclrs
to which his companions were expoed. He was taken ill at

the Spaniards were not deterred fiom engaging in new schemes
of a imilar nature. When wealth is acquired gradually by the
persevering hand of industry, or accumulated by the flow opera-
tions of regular commerce, the means employed are so propor-
tioned to the end attained, that there is nothing to firike the
imagination, and little to urge on the active powers of the mind
to uncommon efforts. But when large fortunes were created
almost instantaneously; when gold and pearls were procured
in exchange for baubles; when the countries which produced
these rich commodities, defended only by naked savages, might
be seized by the first bold invader; objets so singular and al-
luring, rouzed a wonderful spirit of enterprise among the Spa-
niards, who ruflsed with ardour into this new path that was
opened to wealth and diftintion. While this spirit continued
warm and vigorous, every attempt either towards discovery or
conquest was applauded, and adventurers engaged in it with
emulation. The passion for new undertakings, which cha-
raderifes the age of discovery in the latter part of the fifteenth
and beginning of the sixteenth century, would alone have
been sufficient to prevent the Spaniards from flopping hort
in their career. But circumflances peculiar to Hispaniola at
this juncure, concurred with it in extending their naviga-
tion and conquefis. The rigorous treatment of the inha-
bitants of that island having almost extirpated the race, many

Others, with the inconsiderate levity natural to men upon
whom wealth pours in with a ifdden flow, had squandered, in
thoughtless prodigality, what they acquired with ease, and were
driven by necessity to embark in the most desperate schemes, in
g511. order to retrieve their affairs. From all there causes, when Don

Diego Columbus proposed to conquer the island of Cuba, and
to eflablifl a colony there, many persons of chief diftinaion in
H-ispaniola engaged with alacrity in the measure. He gave
the command of the troops defined for that service to Diego
Velasquez, one of his father's companions in his second voyage,
and who, having been long fettled in Hispaniola, had acquired
an ample fortune, with such reputation for probity and pru-
dence, thatthe seemed to be well qualified for conducting an
expedition of importance. Three hundred men were deemed
sufficient for the conquest of an island above seven hundred
miles in length, and filled with inhabitants. But they were
of the fame unwarlike charaCter with the people of Hifpa-
niola. They were not only intimidated by the appearance of
their new enemies, but unprepared to resist them. For though,
from the time that the Spaniards took poffeflion of the adjacent
iland, there was reason to expect a descent on their territories,
none of the small communities into which Cuba was divided,
had either made any provision for its own defence, or had
formed any concert for their common fafcty. The only ob-
ilrudion the Spaniards met with was from H-atuey, a cazique,

dispersed; and he himself being taken prisoner, Velasquez, ac-
cording to the barbarous maxim of the Spaniards, confidered
him as a slave who had taken arms against his mafler, and con-
demned him to the flames. When Hatuey was faflened to the
flake, a Franciscan friar labouring to convert him, promised
him immediate admittance into the joys of heaven, if he would
embrace the Chriflian faith. " Are there any Spaniards," fays
he, after some pause, " in that region of bliss which you de-
scribe ?" "Yes," replied the monk, "but only such as are
worthy and good." " The bell of them," returned the indig-
nant cazique, " have neither worth nor goodness; I will not
go to a place where I may meet with one of that accursed race".
This dreadful example of vengeance struck the people of Cuba
with such terror, that they scarcely gave any opposition to the
progress of their invaders; and Velasquez, without the loss of
a man, annexed this extensive and fertile island to the Spanish
monarchy Y.

THE facility with which this important conquest was corn- Dicovcry of

pleted, served as an incitement to other undertakings. Juan Florida.
Ponce de Leon, having acquired both fame and wealth by the
reducqion of Porto Rico, was impatient to engage in some new
cntcrprife. He fitted out three flips at his own expcnce, for 1s .
a voyage of difcovcry, and his reputation soon drew together

' ance. He attempted to land in different places, but met with

such vigorous opposition from the natives, who were fierce and
warlike, as convinced him that an increase of force was requi-
site to effed a settlement. Satisfied with having opened a com-
munication with a new country, of whose value and importance
he conceived very sanguine hopes, he returned to Porto Rico,
through the channel now known by the name of the Gulf of
Florida.

IT was not merely the passion of searching for new countries

that prompted Ponce de Lcon to undertake this voyage, he was
influenced by one of those visionary ideas, which at that time
often mingled with the spirit of dicfovery, and rendered it
more adive. A tradition prevailed among the natives of
Porto Rico, that in the isle of Bimini, one of the Lucayos,
there was a fountain of such wonderful virtue as to renew the
youth, and recall the vigour of every person who bathed in its
salutary waters. In hopes of finding this grand restorative,
Ponce de Leon and his followers ranged through the islands,
searching, with fruitless solicitude and labour, for the fountain,
which was the chief objec of their expedition. That a tale so
fabulous should gain credit among simple uninfiruded Indians
is not surprising. That it hould make any impression upon
an enlightened people appears, in the present age, altogether
incredible. The fad-, however, is certain; and the most au-
thentic Spanifl historians mention this extravagant ally of their
credulous countrymen. The Spaniards, at that period, were en-
gaged in a career of activity which gavea romantic turn to their
imagination, and daily presented to them frange and marvel-

i11~~~~~~~~ lous

lous objects. A New World was opened to their view. They B o o K
visited islands and continents of whole exiflence mankind in for- ,-
mer ages had no conception. In thoic delightful countries natutre
seemed to assume another form; every tree and plant and animal
was different from those of the ancient hemiflphere. They fecined
to be transported into enchanted ground ; and, after the wonders
which they had seen, nothing, in the warmth and novelty of
their admiration, appeared to them so extraordinary as to be be-
yond belief. If the rapid succession of new and striking fcencs
made such impression even upon the found underflanding of
Columbus, that he boafled of having found the feat of Paradite,
it will not appear firange that Ponce de Leon hould dream of
discovering the fountain of youth .

might invert him with a legal title to the fuprcme command.
Conscious, however, that he could not expet fucccfs from the
patronage of Ferdinand's miniriers, witl whom he was uncon-
nedted, or from negociating in a court to the arts of which lie
was a iranger, he endeavoured to merit the dignity to which he
atifired, and aimed at performing some signal lervice that
would lecurc him the preference to every competitor. Full of

quantity of gold, which abounded more in that part of the
continent than in the ilands. In one of those excursions, the
Spaniards contended with such eagerness about the division of
ioine gold, that.they were at the point of proceeding to ats of
violence against one another. A young cazique, who was prc-
sent, aftonihed at the high value which they set upon a thing
of which he did not discern the lfe, tumbled the gold out of
the balance with indignation; and, turning to the Spaniards,
" Why do you quarrel (fays he) about such a trifle ? If you
are lo paflionately fond of gold, as to abandon your own coun-
try, and to disturb the tranquillity of distant nations for its
fake, I will condua you to a region where the metal which
ieems to be the chief object of your admiration and desire, is o
common that the meanest utensils are formed of it." Tranf-
ported with what they heard, Balboa and his companions in-
quired eagerly where this happy country lay, and how they
might arrive at it. He informed them that at the dirance of
fix funs, that is of fix days journey towards the south, they
should discover another ocean, near to which this wealthy
kingdom was situated; but if they intended to attack that pow-
erful fiate, they must afTemble forces far superior in number

concluded the ocean which the cazique mentioned, to be that ----
for which Columbus had searched without ficcefs in this part of
America, in hopes of opening a more diret communication with
the East Indies; and he conjcaured that the rich territory
which had been deferibed to him, must be part of that vast and
opulent region of the earth. Elated with the idea of performing
what so great a man had attempted in vain; and eager to accom-
plilh a discovery which he knew would be no less acceptable to
the king than beneficial to his country, he was impatient until he
could set out upon this enterprize, in comparison of which all
his former exploits appeared inconsiderable. But previous ar-
rangement and preparation were requisite to ensure fticcefs. He
began with courting and securing the friendflip of the neigh-
bouring caziques. He sent some of his officers to Hifpianiola
with a large quantity of gold, as a proof of his past success,
and an earnest of his future hopes. By a proper dilfribution
of this, they secured the favour of the governor, and allured
volunteers into the service. A considerable reinforcement from
that island joined him, av.d he thought himself in a condition
to attempt the discovery.

down with an impetuous current from the high grounds. In a
region thinly inhabited by wandering savages, the hand of in-
duftry had done nothing to mitigate or correct those natural
disadvantages. To march across this unexplored country, with
no other guides but Indians, whose fidelity could be little
trusted, was, on all those accounts, the boldest enterprise on
which the Spaniards had hitherto ventured in the New World.
But the intrepidity of Balboa was such as distinguished him
among his countrymen, at a period when every adventurer was
5'13. conspicuous for daring courage. Nor was bravery his only me-

rit, he was prudent in conduct, generous, affable, and possessed
of those popular talents which, in the moit desperate undertak-
ings, inspire confidence and secure attachment. Even after the
jundion of the volunteers from Hispaniola, he was able to
muster only an hundred and ninety men for his expedition.
But they were hardy veterans, inured to the climate of Ame-
rica, and ready to follow him through every danger. A thou-
sand Indians attended them to carry their provisions; and to
complete their warlike array, they took with them several of
those fierce dogs, which were no less formidable than deftruc-
tive to their naked enemies.

Difcvers the BALBOA set out upon this important expedition on the first
South Sea. of September, about the time that the periodical rains began to

abate. He proceeded by sea, and without any difficulty, to
the territories of a caziquc whose friendfliip he had gained;
but no sooner did he begin to advance into the interior part of

thle

the country, than he was retarded by every obstacle, which he B 0 0 K
had.reafon to apprehend, from the nature of the territory, or '--"--
the disposition of its inhabitants. Some of the caziques, at his
approach, fled to the mountains with all their people, and car-
ried off or destroyed whatever could afford subsistence to his
troops. Others collected their subjects, in order to oppose his
progress, and he quickly perceived what an arduous undertak-
ing it was, to conduc such a body of men through hoffile na-
tions, across swamps and rivers, and woods, which had never
been paired but by straggling Indians. But by haring in
every hardship with the meanest soldier, by appearing the fore-
most to meet every danger, by promising confidently to his troops
the enjoyment of honour and riches superior to what had been
attained by the most successful of their countrymen, he inspired
them with such enthusiastic resolution, that they followed him
without murmuring. When they had penetrated a good
way into the mountains, a powerful cazique appeared in
a narrow pass, with a numerous body of his fubjeas to
obftrud their progress. But men who had fuirmounted b
many obstacles, despised the opposition of such feeble ene-
mies. They attacked them with impetuosity, and having
dispersed them with much ease and great slaughter, continued
their march. Though their guides had represented the breadth
of the isthmus to be only a journey of fix days, they had
already spent twenty-five in forcing their way through the
woods and mountains. Many of them were ready to fink
under such uninterrupted fatigue in that filtry climate, fcvcral
were seized with the diseases peculiar to the country, and all
became impatient to reach the period of their labours and sus--
ferings. At length the Indians aflured them, that fiom the

a. .---a was the objecq of their wishes. When, with infinite toil, they

had climbed up the greater part of that sleep ascent, Balboa
commanded his men to halt, and advanced alone to the fum-
mit, that he might be the first who hould enjoy a fpetacle
which he had so long desired. As soon as he beheld the South
Sea firetching in endless profped below him, he fell on his
knees, and lifting up his hands to Heaven, returned thanks to
God, who had conducted him to a discovery so beneficial to his
country, and so honourable to himself. His followers, obferv-
ing his transports of joy, rulhed forward to join in his wonder,
exultation and gratitude. They held on their course to the
shore with great alacrity, when Balboa advancing up to the
middle in the waves with his buckler and sword, took possession
of that ocean in the name of the king his mailer, and vowed. toa

Balboa first discovered, still retains the name of the Gulf of St.

nama. From several of the petty princes, who governed in
the diflricts adjacent to that gulf, he extorted. provisions and
gold by force of arms. Others ent them to him voluntarily.

fidcrable quantity of pearls; and he learned from them, with

they drew upon the sand the figure of the Llamas or ieep, as-
terwards found in Peru, which the Peruvians had taught to
perform such services as they described. As the Llama, in its
form, nearly resembles a camel, a beast of burden deemed pccu-

very of the pearls, another noted production of that country,

Francisco Pizarro, or assisted with greater courage and ardour

Pedrarias ap. BALBOA'S firfl care was to fend information to Spain of the
pointed go-
vernor of important discovery which he had made; and to demand a re-
Varien. inforcement of a thousand men, in order to attempt the con-

quest of that opulent country, concerning which he had received
such inviting intelligence. The firfi account of the discovery
of the New World hardly occasioned greater joy than the un-
expeAed tidings, that a palage was at last found to the great
southern ocean. The communication with the East Indies, by
a course to the westward of the line of debarkation, drawn by
the Pope, seemed now to be certain. The vast wealth which
flowed into Portugal from its settlements and conqueits in that
country, excited the envy and called forth the emulation of
other flates. Ferdinand hoped now to come in for a hare in
this lucrative commerce, and in his eagerness to obtain it, was
willing to make an effort beyond what Balboa required. But
even in this exertion, his jealous policy, as well as the fatal
antipathy of Fonseca, now bishop of Burgos, to every man of
merit who diflinguifled himself in the New World, were con-
fpicuous. Notwithflanding Balboa's recent services, which
marked him out as the most proper person to finish that great

undertaking which he had begun, Ferdinand was so ungenerous B 0 I K
as to overlook there, and to appoint Pedrarias Davila governor A
of Darien. He gave him the command of fifteen flout vessels, S4
and twelve hundred soldiers. These were fitted out at the pub-
lic expence, with a liberality which Ferdinand had never dif-
played in any former armament deiftned for the New World; and
such was the ardour of the Spanish gentlemen to follow a leader
who was about to conduct them to a country, where, as fame
reported, they had only to throw their nets into the ea and
draw out gold , that fifteen hundred embarked on board the
fleet, and if they had not been restrained, a much greater
number would have engaged in the service h.

PEDRARIAS reached the gulf of Darien without any remark-

able accident, and immediately sent some of his principal offi-
cers ashore, to inform Balboa of his arrival, with the king's
commission, to be governor of the colony. To their aflonifh-
ment, they found Balboa, of whose great exploits they had
heard so much, and of whose opulence they had formed such
high ideas, clad in a canvas jacket, and wearing the coarse
hempen sandals used only by the meanest peasants, employed,
together with some Indians, in thatching his own hut with
reeds. Even in this imple garb, which corresponded bs ill
with the expecations and wishes of his new guests, Balboa
received them with dignity. The fame of his discoveries had
drawn so many adventurers from the islands, that he could
now multer four hundred and fifty men. At the head of those
daring veterans, he was more than a match for the forces which
Pedrarias brought with him. But though his troops murmured

appointed a judicial inquiry to be made into his condu&, while
under the command of NicuefTa and Encifco, and imposed a con-
fiderable fine upon him, on account of the irregularities of
which he had then been guilty. Balboa felt sensibly the nor-
tification of being fubjeCed to trial and to punishment in a place
where he had so lately occupied the first flation. Pedrarias
could not conceal his jealousy of his superior merit; so that the
resentment of the one, and the envy of the other, gave rife to
diifentions extremely detrimental to the colony. It was threat-
ened with a calamity flill more fatal. Pedrarias had landed in
July. Darien at a most unlucky time of the year, about the middle

.of the rainy season, in that part of the torrid zone where the
clouds pour down such torrents as are unknown in more tem-
perate climates k. The village of Santa Maria was feated in a
rich plain, cnvironcd with inarles and woods. The conftitu-
tion of Europeans was unable to withfland the petfilential in-
fluencc of such a ituation, in a climate naturally so noxious,
and at a Icafon so peculiarly unhealthy. A violent and dc-
flrudive malady carried off many of the soldiers who accom-
panicd Pcdrarias. An extreme scarcity ofprovifions augmented
this diflrcs, as it rendered it impofible to find proper refrefl-

In the space of a month, above fix hundred persons perifled in
the utmost misery. Dejedion and despair spread through the 1514
colony. Many principal persons solicited their difmi-flion, and
were glad to relinquish all their hopes of wealth, in order to
escape from that pernicious region. Pedrarias endeavoured to
divert those who remained from brooding over their misfor-
tunes, by finding them employment. With this view, he sent
several detachments into the interior parts of the country, to
levy gold among the natives, and to search for the mines in
which it was produced. Those rapacious adventurers, more
attentive to present gain than to the means of facilitating their
fiture progress, plundered without diftindion wherever they
marched. Regardless of the alliances which Balboa had made
with several of the caziques, they stripped them of every thing
valuable, and treated them, as well as their fubjeds, with the
utmost i-nfalence and cruelty. By their tyranny and exa&ions,
which Pedrarias, either from want of authority or of inclina-
tion, did not restrain, all the country from the gulf of Daricn
to the lake of Nicaragua was desolatcd, and the Spaniards were
inconsiderately deprived of the advantages which they might
have derived from the friendship of the natives, in extending
their conquests to the South Sea. Balboa, who saw with con-
cern that such ill-judged proceedings retarded the execution
of his favourite scheme, ent violent remonstrances to Spain
against the imprudent government of Pedrarias, which had
ruined a happy and flourishing colony. Pedrarias, on the
other hand, accused him of having deceived the king, by magni-

Balboa in all his operations, and to consult with him concerning
Is51. every measure which he himself pursued. But to effect such a

sudden transition from inveterate enmity to perfect confidence,
exceeded Ferdinand's power. Pedrarias continued to treat his
rival with neglet; and Balboa's fortune being exhausted by
the payment of his fine, and other exacions of Pedrarias, he
could'not make suitable preparations for taking possession of
his new government. At length, by the interposition and ex-
hortations of the bishop, of Darien, they were brought to a
reconciliation; and, in order to cement this union more firmly,
Pedrarias agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Balboa.

to make several small incursions into the eountry. There he con-
dured with such prudence, as- added to the reputation which
he had already acquired. Many adventurers retorted to him,
and, with the countenance and aid of Pedrarias, he began to pre-
pare for his expedition to the South Sea. In order to accomplish
this, it was necelFary to build vessels capable of conveying his
troops to those provinces which he purposed to invade. After

he at length finished four fiall brigantines. In there, with three s'5 7
hundred chosen men, a force superior to that with which Pi-
zarro afterwards undertook the fame expedition, he was ready
to fail towards Peru, when he received an unexpected message
from Pedrarias". As his reconciliation with Balboa had never
been cordial, the progress which he made revived his ancient
enmity, and added to its rancour. He dreaded the prosperity
and elevation of a man whom he had injured so deeply. He
fufpeted that success would encourage him to aim at inde-
pendence upon his jurifdi&cion; and so violently did the pas-
sions of hatred, fear, and jealousy, operate upon his mind, that,
in order to gratify his vengeance, he scrupled not to defeat an
enterprise of the greatest moment to his country. Under pretexts
which were false, but plausible, he desired Balboa to postpone
his voyage for a short time, and to repair to Acla, in order that
he might have an interview with him. Balboa, with the un-
suspicious confidence of a man conscious of no crime, inflantly
obeyed the summons; but as oon as he entered the place, he
was arrested by order of Pedrarias, whose impatience to satiate
his revenge did not susser him to languish long in confinement.
Judges were immediately appointed to proceed to his trial. An
accusation of disloyalty to the king, and of an intention to re-
volt against the governor, was preferred againfi him. Sentence
of death was pronounced; and though the judges who palsed it,
seconded by the whole colony,, interceded warmly for his par-
don, Pedrarias continued inexorable; and, to their aflonili-
ment and sorrow, the Spaniards beheld the public execution

Ferdinand was so intent upon opening a. oommunisation with
the Molucca or Spice Islands by the weft, that, in the year one
thousand five hundred and fifteen, he fitted out two ships at his
own expence, in order to attempt such a voyage, and gave the
command of them to Juan Diaz de Solis, who was deemed the
most skilful navigator in Spain. He food along the coast of
South America, and, on the firfi of January one thousand five

where an extensive commerce is now carried on. From thence
he proceeded to a spacious bay, which he supposed to be the
entrance into a firait that communicated with the Indian ocean;

'buquerque entered upon his office with all the rapacity of an
indigent adventurer, impatient to amass wealth. He began
with taking the exact number of Indians in the island, and
found, that from sixty thousand, who, in the year one thousand
five hundred and eight, survived after all their sufferings, they
were now reduced to fourteen thousand. These he threw into
separate divisions or lots, and betlowed them upon such as were
willing to purchase them at the highest price. By this arbi-
trary difiribution, several of the natives were removed from
their original habitations, many were taken from their ancient
mailers, and all of them fubjeded to heavier burdens, and to
more intolerable labour, in order to reimburse their new pro-
prietors. Those additional calamities completed the misery,
and hastened on the extinction of this wretched and innocent
race of men .

From the time that Ecclefiaflics were sent as inftrudors in- _---
to America, they perceived that the rigour with which their
countrymen treated the natives, rendered their ministry al-
together fruitless. The missionaries, in conformity to the mild
spirit of that religion which they were employed to publish,
early remonstrated against the maxims of the planters with
refpea to the Americans, and condemned the repartimientos,
or dfiributions, by which they were given up as slaves
to their conquerors, as no less contrary to natural juflice and
the precepts of Christianity, than to found policy. The Do-
minicans, to whom the inftruacion of the Americans was ori-
ginally committed, were most vehement in teflifying against
the repartimientos. In the year one thousand five, hundred and
eleven. Montefino, one of their most eminent preachers, in-
.veighed against this: pracice in the great church at St. Domingo,
with all the impetuosity of popular eloquence. Don Diego
Columbus, the principal officers of the colony, and all the
laymen who had been his hearers, complained of the monk to
his superiors; but they, instead of condemning, applauded his
doctrine, as equally pious and seasonable. The Franciscans,
influenced by the spirit of opposition and rivallhip which sub-
sifts between the two orders, discovered some inclination to take
.part with the laity, and to espouse the defence.of the reparti-
mientos. But as.they could not with decency give their avowed
approbation to a fyffem of oppreflion, so repugnant to the fpi-
rit of religion, they endeavoured to palliate what they could
not justify, and alleged, in excuse for the conduct of their
countrymen, that it was impoflible to carry on any improve-
ment in the colony, unless the Spaniards possessed such do-

.Cnntrarydc- THE Dominicans, regardless of such political and interefled
cilions con-
cerningthis considerations, would not relax in any degree the rigour of
.point. their sentiments, and even refused to absolve, or admit to the

sacraments, such of their countrymen as held the natives in
servitude". Both parties applied to the'king for.his decision in
.a matter of such importance. Ferdinand empowered a com-
mittee of his privy-council, affifled by some of the :most eminent
civilians and divines in Spain, to hear the deputies sent from
Hispaniola, in support of their refpedive opinions. After a
long discussion, the speculative point in controverfywas deter-
.mined in favour of the Dominicans, the Indians were declared
to be a free people, intitled to all the natural rights of men;
-but, iotwirhftanding this decision, the repartimientos were con-
tinued upon their ancient footing . As this determination
admitted the principle upon which the Dominicans founded
their opinion, it was not calculated either to silence or to con-
vince them. At length, in order to quiet the colony, which
was alarmed 'by their remonfirances and censures, Ferdinand
issued a decree of 'his privy-council, declaring, that after ma-
ture confidetation of the Apostolic Bull, and other titles by
,,1S3. whidh the crown of Castile claimed a right to its possessions in

the New World, the servitude of the Indians was warranted
both by the laws of God and of man; that unless they were sub-
jeded to the dominion of the Spaniards, and compelled to re-
fide under their infpeaion, it would be impossible to reclaim

them from idolatry, or to inftrua them in the principles of the B o ° K
Chriflian faith; that no farther scruple ought to be entertained -
concerning the lawfulness of the repartimientos, as the king
and council werewilling to take the charge of that upon their
own consciences; and that therefore the Dominicans, and monks
of other religious orders, hould abstain, for the future, from
those invedives, which, from an excess of charitable, but ill-
informed zeal, they had uttered against that practice .

THAT his intention of adhering to this decree might be

fully underfiood, Ferdinand conferred new grants of Indians
upon several of his courtiers . But, in order that he might
not fecin altogether inattentive to the rights of humanity, he
publifled an edid, in which he endeavoured to provide for the
mild treatment of the Indians under the yoke to which he sub-
jeaded them; he regulated the nature of the work which they
should be required to perform, he prescribed the mode in
which they should be clothed and fed, and gave directions
with refped to their inftruaion in the principles of Chrifti-
anity '.

BUT the Dominicans, who, from their experience of what Effetaof

was pafl, judged concerning the future, oon perceived the thcre.
inefficacy of those provisions, and foretold, that as long as it
was the intercft of individuals to treat the Indians with rigour,
no public regulations could render their fcrvitude mild or
tolerable. They confidcred it as vain to waste their own time
and strength in attempting to communicate the sublime truths
of religion to men, whose spirits were broken, and their facul-

of the Spaniards, or alienated by their cruelty from the Chri-

Indians .

Bartholomew THE violent operations of Albuquerque, the new diitributor

defence of
dhel ndians. partimienltos, and called forth an advocate for that oppressed

people, who poifeffed all the courage, the talents, and adivity
requisite in supporting such a desperate cause. This was Bar-
tholomew de las Casas, a native of Seville, and one of the
clergymen lent out with Columbus in his second voyage to
Hispaniola, in order to fettle in that island. He early adopted
the opinion prevalent among ecclesiastics, with refped to the
unlawfulness of reducing the natives to servitude; and that he
might demonfirate the sincerity of his conviction, he relinquished
all the Indians who had fallen to his own hare in the division of
the inhabitants among their conquerors, declaring that he should
ever bewail his own misfortune and guilt, in having exercised
for a moment this impious dominion over his fellow-creatures '.
From that time, he was the avowed patron of the Indians;
and by his bold interpositions in their behalf, as well as by the
refped due to his abilities and chara&er, he had often the me-
rit of setting ome bounds to the excesses of his countrymen.

the guilt of having authorised this impious measure, which had
brought misery and destruction upon a numerous and innocent
race of men, whom Providence had placed under his protection.
Ferdinand, whose mind as well as body was much enfeebled
by his distemper, was greatly alarmed at this charge of im-
piety, which at another juncture he would have despised. He
listened with deep compunction to the discourse of Las Casas,
and promised to take into attentive consideration the means
of redrefling the evil of which he complained. But death
prevented him from executing his resolution. Charles of
Austria, to whom all his crowns devolved, resided at that time
in his paternal dominions in the Low Countries. Las Casas,
with his usual ardour, prepared immediately to set out for Flan-
ders, in order to occupy the ear of the young monarch, when
cardinal Ximenes, who, as regent, assumed the reins of govern-
ment in Castile, commanded him to desist from the journey, and
engaged to hear his complaints in person.

either the rights of Don Diego Columbus, or the regulations

to America as superintendents of all the colonies there, with
authority, after examining all circumflances on the spot, to
decide finally with refped to the point in question. It was a
matter of deliberation and delicacy to chufe men qualified
for such an important fiation. As all the laymen fettled in
America, or who had been consulted in the adminifiratibn of
that department, had given their opinion that the Spaniards
could not keep possession of their new settlements, unless they
were allowed to retain their dominion over the Indians, he saw
that he could not rely on their impartiality, and determined to
commit the trust to ecclesiastics. As the Dominicans and Fran-
cifcans hd already espoused opposite fides in the controversy,
he, from the fame principle, excluded both there fraternities
from the commission. He confined his choice to the monks of
St. Jerome, a small, but refpedable order in Spain. With the
afiftlance of their general, and in concert with Las Casas, he
soon pitched upon three persons whom he deemed equal to the
charge. To them he joined Zuazo, a private lawyer of dif-
tinguished probity, with unbounded power to regulate all judi-
cial proceedings in the colonies. Las Casas was appointed to
accompany them, with the title of Protctor of the Indians o

Zapata, and other ministers of the late king, a measure so wild cuted.
and dangerous, that they refused to issue the dispatches necef-
fary for carrying it into execution. But: Ximenes was not of
a temper patiently to brook opposition to any of his schemes.
He ent for the refratory ministers, and addressed them in such
a tone, that in the utmost contfernation they obeyed his or-
ders'. The superintendents, with their aflbciate Zuazo, and
Las Casas, failed for St. Domingo. Upon their arrival, the
first a of their authority was to set at liberty all the Indians
who had been granted to the Spanish courtiers, or to any per-
son not residing in America. This, together with the infor-
mation which had been received from Spain concerning the
objed of the commission, spread a general alarm. The colonists
concluded that they were to be deprived at once of the hands
with which they carried on their labour, and that, of confe-
quence, ruin was unavoidable. But the fathers of St. Jerome
proceeded with such caution and prudence, as oon diflipated
all their fears. They discovered, in every tfep of their con-
du, a knowledge of the world, and of affairs which is seldom
acquired in a cloister; and displayed a moderation and gentle-
ness still more rare, among persons trained up in the solitude
and auflerity of a monastic life. Their ears were open to infor-
mation from every quarter, they compared the different ac-
counts which they received, and, after a mature consideration
of the whole, they were fully satisfied that the slate of the

B 0o K colony rendered it impossible to adopt the plan proposed by
L--». .- Las Casas, and recommended by the cardinal. They plainly

1517 perceived that the Spaniards fettled in America were so few in

number, that they could neither work the mines which had
been opened, nor cultivate the country; that they depended
for both upon the labour of the natives, and if deprived of it,
they must instantly relinquish their conquests, or give up all the
advantages which they derived from them; that no allurement
was so powerful as to surmount the natural aversion of the In-
dians to any laborious effort, and that nothing but the autho-
rity of a mailer could compel them to work; and if they were
not kept conflantly under the eye and discipline of a superior,
so great was their natural listlessness and indifference, that they
would neither attend to religious inflrudion, nor observe those
rites of Christianity which they had been already taught. Upon
all those accounts, the superintendents found it necessary to tole-
rate the repartimiettos, and to susser the Indians to remain under
fubjetion to their Spanish maiers. They used their utmoti en-
deavours, however, to prevent the fatal effecs of this etablilh.
ment, and to secure the Indians the consolation of the befl
treatment compatible with a slate of servitude. For this pur-
pose, they revived former regulations, they prescribed new
ones, they negleced no circumstance that tended to mitigate
the rigour of the yoke; and by their authority, their example,
and their exhortations, they laboured to inspire their country-
men with fcntiments of equity and gentleness towards the un-
happy people upon whose industry they depended. Zuazo, in
his department, seconded the endeavours of the superintendents.
He reformed the courts of juflice, in such a manner as to ren-
der their decisions equitable as well as expeditious, and intro-
duced various regulations which greatly improved the interior

police of the colony. The fatisfalion which his conduR, and B 0o K
that of the superintendents gave, was now universal among the --
Spaniards fettled in the New World, and all admired the bold- '
ness of Ximenes, in having departed from the ordinary path of
business in forming his plan, as well as his sagacity in pitching
upon persons, whose wisdom, moderation, and difintereflednefs
rendered them worthy of this high trust .

LAS CA SAS alone was dissatisfied. The prudential confider- LasCafa,

diflatisfied

ations which influenced the superintendents, made no impref- with themi
sion upon him. He regarded their idea of accommodating
their conduct to the state of the colony, as the maxim of an
unhallowed timid policy, which tolerated what was unjust, be-
cause it was beneficial. He contended, that the Indians were
by nature free, and, as their protetor, he required the super-
intendents not to bereave them of the common privilege of
humanity. They received his most virulent remonstrances
without emotion, but adhered firmly to their own fyllem. The
Spanish planters did not bear with him so patiently, and were
ready to tear him in pieces for insisting in a requisition o odi-
ous to them. Las Casas, in order to screen himself from their
rage found it necessary to take shelter in a convent; and per-
ceiving that all his efforts in America were fruitless, he soon
set out for Europe, with a fixed resolution not to abandon the
protecion of a people whom he deemed to be cruelly op-
pressed .

daily expeced from the Low Countries. Charles arrived, took
poffflion of the government, and, by the death of Ximenes,
loft a minister, whose abilities and integrity intitled him to
direc his affairs. Many of the Flemish nobility had accom-
panied their sovereign to Spain. From that warm predilection
to his countrymen, which was natural at his age, he consulted
them with refped to all the tranfadions in his new kingdom,
and they, with an indiscreet eagerness, intruded themselves
into every business, and seized almost every department of ad-
minifiration h. The direcion of American affairs was an ob-
jet too alluring to escape their attention. Las Casas observed
their growing influence, and though projetors are usually too
sanguine, to conduat their schemes with much dexterity, he
possessed a bustling indefatigable activity, which sometimes
accomplishes its purposes with greater success, than the most
exquisite discernment and address. He courted the Flemish
minifers with assiduity. He represented to them the absurdity
of all the maxims hitherto adopted with respect to the govern-
ment of America, and particularly the defects of that arrange-
'ment which Ximenes had introduced. The memory of Ferdi-
nand was odious to the Flemings. The superior virtue and
abilities of Ximenes had long been the object of their envy.
They fondly wished to have a plausible pretext for condemning
the measures, both of the monarch and of the minister, and of
reflecting ome discredit on their political wisdom. The friends
of Don Diego Columbus, as well as the Spanilh courtiers, who

had been dissatisfied with the cardinal's adminifiration,joined Las GB o K
Casas in censuring the scheme offending fuperintendants to Ame- -- --'
rica. This union of so many interests and passions was irrefift- '517
ible; and, in consequence of it, the fathers of St. Jerome,and their
associate Zuazo, were recalled. Roderigo de Figueroa, a law-
yer of some eminence, was appointed chief judge of the island,
and received inRruaions, in compliance with the request of Las
Casas, to examine once more, with the utmost attention, the
point in controversy between him and the people of the colony,
with refped to the treatment of the natives; and in the mean
time to do every thing in his power to alleviate their sufferings,
and prevent the extinaion of the race'.

THsis was all that the zeal of Las Casas could procure, at Scheme of
thatjuncure, in favour of the Indians. The impossibility of fiLpplyingthe

colonies with

carrying on any improvement in America, unless the Spanish negroes.
planters could command the labour of the natives, was an in-
superable objetion to his plan of treating them as free sub-
jeds. In order to provide some remedy for this, without
which he found it was vain to mention his scheme, Las Casas,
proposed to purchase a sufficient number of negroes from
the Portuguese lettlements on the coast of Africa, and to
transport them to America, in order that they might be
employed as slaves in working the mines and cultivating the
ground. One of the first advantages which the Portuguefc
had derived from their discoveries in Africa, arose fiom the
trade in slaves. Various circumflanccs concurred in reviving
this odious commerce, which had been long alolifhicd in
Europe, and which is no lets repugnant to te feelings of
humanity, than to the principles of religion. As early as the
year one thouflind five hundred and three, a few ncgro slaves

robust and hardy race than the natives of America. They were
more capable of enduring fatigue, more patient under fervi-
tude, and the labour of one negro was computed to be equal to
that of four Indians". Cardinal Ximenes, however, when so-
licited to encourage this commerce, peremptorily rejected the
proposition, because he perceived the iniquity of reducing one
race of men to slavery, while he was consulting about the
means of refloring liberty to another". But Las Casas, from
the inconsistency natural to men who hurry with headlong im-
petuofity towards a favourite point, was incapable of making
this diftinaion. While he contended earnefily for the liberty
of the people born in one quarter of the globe, he laboured to
enslave the inhabitants of another region; and in the warmth
of his zeal to save the Americans from the yoke, pronounced
it to be lawful and expedient to impose one fill heavier upon
the Africans. Unfortunately for the latter, Las Cafas's plan
was adopted. Charles granted a patent to one of his Flemish
favourites, containing an exclusive right of importing four
thousand negroes into America. He fold his patent to ome
Gcnoefe merchants for twenty-five thousand ducats, and they
were the first who brought into a regular form that commerce
for slaves between Africa and America, which has since been
carried on to such an amazing extcnt".

price for negroes, that the number imported into H-ispaniola made B 0° 1
no great change upon the slate of the colony. Las Casas, whose --.-
zeal was no le's inventive than indefatigable, had recourse to 1517.
another expedient for the relief of the Indians. He observed,
that moil of the persons who had fettled hitherto in America,
were soldiers and sailors employed in the discovery or conquest
of the country; the younger sons of noble families, allured by
the prospect of acquiring sudden wealth; or desperate adven-
turers, whom their indigence or crimes forced to abandon their
native land. Inflead of such men, who were dissolute, rapa-
cious, and incapable of that fober persevering industry which
is requisite in forming new colonies, he proposed to supply
the new settlements in Hispaniola and the other islands with a
sufficient nmber of labourers and husbandmen, who hould be
allured by suitable premiums to remove thither. These, as
they were accustomed to fatigue, would be able to perform the
work, to which the Indians, from the feebleness of their con-
flitution, were unequal, and might soon become useful and
opulent citizens. But though Hispaniola flood much in need
of a recru'it of inhabitants, having been visited at this time
with the finall-pox, which swept off many of the natives, and
though Las Caias had the countenance of the Flemifli minitfers,
this scheme was defeated by the bilhop of Burgos, who thwarted
all his projects .

Ri' ll occupied the whole country. This opened a new and more
ample field for the humanity and zeal of Las Casas, who flat-
tered himself that he might prevent a pernicious system from
being introduced there, though he had failed of success in his
attempts to overturn it, where it was already established. Full
of this idea, he applied for a grant of the unoccupied country,
stretching along the fea-coaf from the gulf of Paria to the
western frontier of that province now known by the name of
Santa Martha. He proposed to fettle there with a colony com-
posed of husbandmen, labourers, and ecclesiastics. He en-
gaged, in the space of two years, to civilize ten thousand of the
natives, and to inftruc them so thoroughly in the arts of social
life, that, from the fruits of their industry, an annual revenue
of fifteen thousand ducats hould arise to the king. In ten years
he expected that his improvements would be so far advanced,
as to yield annually sixty thousand ducats. He flipulated, that
no sailor or soldier should ever be permitted to fettle in this
difiridt; and that no Spaniard should enter it without his
permiflion. He even projeced to clothe the people whom
he took along with him in ome peculiar garment, which did
not resemble the Spanifl dress, that they might appear to the
natives to be a different race of men from those who had brought
so many calamities upon their country'. From this scheme, of
which I have traced only the great lines, it is manifest that Las
Casas had formed ideas concerning the method of treating the
Indians, fitnilar to those by which the Jesuits afterwards carried
on their great operations in another part of the fame continent.
He fiuppofed that the Europeans, by availing thcmfelvcs of that

render them capable of its funtions.

this projeat appeared not only chimerical, but dangerous in a
high degree. They deemed the faculties of the Americans to
be naturally so limited, and their indolence so exceflive, that
any attempt to inflrudt or improve them would be fruitless.
They contended, that it would be extremely imprudent to give
the command of a country extending above a thousand miles
along the coafl, to a fanciful, presumptuous enthusiast, a firan-
ger to the affairs of the world, and unacquainted with the arts
of government. Las Casas, far fiom being discouraged with a
repulse, which he had reason to expea, had recourse once more
to the Flemish favourites, who zealously patronized his scheme,
merely because it had been rejeded by the Spanish ministers.
They prevailed with their matser, who had lately been raised to
the Imperial dignity, to refer the consideration of this measure
to a felea number of his privy-counfcllors; and as Las Casas
excepted againfl the members of the council of the Indies, as
partial and intcreflcd, they were all excluded. The decision
of men chosen by recommendation of the Flemings, was
perfectly conformable to their fentimcnts. They warmly ap-
proved of Las Cafas's plan ; and gave orders for carrying it into
execution, but rcflritcd te territory allotted him to three hun-
dred miles along the coast of Cumana, allowing him, how-
ever, to extend it as fr as hc plealed towards the interior part
of the countryr.

BOO K THIS determination did not pass uncenfured. Almost every

'---- perlon who had been in the Weft Indies exclaimed against it,
A foleinn de- and supported their opinion so confidently, and with such plau-

ner fible reasons, as made it advisable to pause and to review the

theamodeof subjed more deliberately. Charles himself, though accustomed,
treating the
Indians, at this early period of his life, to adopt the sentiments of his

ministers, with such fubmiflive deference as did not promnie
that decisive vigour of mind which diflinguifhed his riper years,
could not help fufpessing that the eagerness with which the Fle-
mings took part in every affair relating to America, flowed from
some improper motive, and began to discover an inclination to
examine in person into the fate of the queflion concerning the
charaaer of the Americans, and the proper manner of treating
june zo. them. An opportunity of making this inquiry, with great

advantage, soon occurred. Qevedo, the bishop of Darien,
who"had accompanied Pedrarias to the continent in the year
one thousand five hundred and thirteen, happened to land at
Barcelona, where the court then resided. It was quickly known,
that his sentiments concerning the talents and disposition of the
Indians differed from those of Las Casas; and Charles naturally
concluded, that by confronting two refpeaable persons, who,
during their long residence in America, had full leisure to ob-
serve the manners of the people whom they pretended to de-
fcrile, he might be able to discover which of them had formed
his opinion with the greatest discernment and accuracy.

A DAY for this folcmn audience was appointed. The em-

peror appeared with extraordinary pomp, and took his feat oi

tiers; attended. Don Diego Columbus, admiral of the Indies,

imputed, in some degree, to the excelfive rigour and inconfi-

people of the New World, whom lie had seen either in the
continent or in the islands, appeared to him to be a race of men
marked out, by the inferiority of their talents, for servitude,
and whom it would be impossible to infrruc or improve, unles
they were kept under the continual infpetion of a mafler. Las
Calas, at greater length, and with more fervour, defended his
own fyflem. He rejeted with indignation the idea that any
race of men was born to servitude, as irreligious and inhumane.
He aflerted, that the faculties of the Americans were not na-
turally despicable, but unimproved; that they were capable of
receiving inftrution in the principles of religion, as well as of
acquiring the indufiry and arts which would qualify them for
the various offices of social life; that the mildness and timidity
of their nature rendered them so fubmiflive and docile, that they
might be led and formed with a gentle hand. He profefled,
that his intentions in proposing the scheme now under confi-
deration were pure and difinterefled; and though, from the
accompliflment of his designs, ineflimable benefits would result
to the crown of Cafile, he never had claimed, nor ever would.

was the island of Porto-Rico. There he received an account
of a new obstacle to the execution of his scheme, more infil-
perable than any he had hitherto encountered. When he left
America in the year one thousand five hundred and seventeen,
the Spaniards had little intercourse with any part of the con-
tinent, except the countries adjacent to the gulf of Darien.
But as every species of internal industry began to fIagnate in
Hispaniola,' when, by the rapid decrease of the natives, the
Spaniards were deprived of those hands with which they had
hitherto carried on their operations, this prompted them to try

various expedients for supplying that loss. Considerable num- B OO K

them. In order to procure slaves at an easier rate, some of
there fitted out veflels to cruize along the coaf of the continent.
In places where they found themselves inferior in strength, they
traded with the natives, and gave European toys in exchange
for the plates of gold worn by them as ornaments; but,
wherever they could surprise or overpower the Indians, they
carried them off by force, and fold them as slaves in Hifpa-
niola'. In those predatory excursions the most atrocious ads
of violence and cruelty were committed. The Spanish name
was held in detelsation all over the continent. Whenever any
hips appeared, the inhabitants either fled to the woods, or
rushed down to the ihore in arms, to repel those hated disturbers
of their tranquillity. They forced some parties of the Spaniards
to retreat with precipitation; they cut off others; and in the
violence of their resentment against the whole nation, they
murdered two Dominican missionaries, whose zeal had prompted
them to fettle in the province of Cumana ". This outrage
.against persons revered for their fandity, excited such indigna-
tion among the people of Hispaniola, who, notwithflahding all
their licentious and cruel proceedings, were poefllecd with a
wonderful zeal for religion, and a fperflitious rcfpet for its
miniflers, that they determined to inflict exemplary punish-
ment, not only upon the perpetrators of that crime, but upon
the whole race. With this view, they gave the command of
five fliips and three hundred men to )icgo Ocampo, with or-
ders to lay wafc the country of Ciiinana witli lire and sword,
and to transport all the inhabitants as slaves to lHifpaniola.

many concurring causes, the reception which Las Casas met
with in Hispaniola was very unfavourable. In his negociations
for the relief of the Indians, he had censured the condu of
his countrymen fettled there with such honest severity, as ren-
dered him universally odious to them. They confidered their
own ruin as the inevitable consequence of his success. They
were now elated with hope of receiving a large recruit of
slaves from Cumana, which must be relinquihed if Las Casas
were affifled in fettling his projeted colony there. Figueroa,
in consequence of the infirutions he had received in Spain,
had made an experiment concerning the capacity of the Indians,
which was represented as decisive against the fyftemofLas Casas.
-le collcqed in Hispaniola a good number of the natives, and
fettlcd them in two villages, leaving them at perfect liberty,
and with the uncontrouled direction of their own aaions. But

hated the people to whom he applied from himself and from fc
his measures, Las Casas, by his ativity and perseverance, by
some concessions, and many threats, obtained at length a small
body of troops to protet him and his colony at their first land-
ing. But upon his return to Porto-Rico, he found that the
diseases of the climate had been fatal to several of his people; and
that others having got employment in that island, refused to
follow him. With the handful that remained, he set fail and
landed in Cumana. Ocampo had executed his commiflion in that
province with such barbarous rage, having massacred many of
the inhabitants, sent others in chains to HIifpaniola, and forced
the reft to fly for helter to the woods, that the people of a
small colony, which he had planted at a place which he named
Toledo, were ready to perish for want in a desolated country.
There, however, Las Casas was obliged to fix his residence,

and by those under the command of Ocampo, who foresaw and
dreaded the calamities to which he muff be exposed in that
wretched flation. e made the best provision in his power for
the safety and subsistence of his followers; but as his utmost
efforts availed little towards securing either the one or the other,
he returned to Hispaniola, in order to solicit more effecQual aid

B OO K ventured into a post of so much danger. Soon after his depar-
..--.--.. ture, the natives, having discovered the feeble and defenceless

'5'7' slate of the Spaniards, aflembled secretly, attacked them with

the fury natural to men exasperated by many injuries, cut off
a good number, and compelled the reft to fly in the utmost
confternaiion to the island of Cubagua. The finall colony
fettled there, on account of the pearl fishery, catching the pa-
nic with which their countrymen had been seized, abandoned
the island, and not a Spaniard remained in any part of the con-
tinent, or adjacent islands, from the gulf of Paria to the borders
of Darien. Astonished at such a succession of disasters, Las
Casas was ahamed to flew his face after this fatal termination
of all his splendid schemes. He hut himself up in the convent
of the Dominicans at St. Domingo, and oon after assumed the
habit of that order Z.

THOUGH the expulsion of the colony from Cumana hap-

pened in the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-one,
I have chosen to trace the progress of Las Casas negociations
from their first rife to their final issue without interruption.
His system was the objec of long. and attentive difcuflion; and
though his efforts in behalf of the oppressed Americans, partly
from his own rashness and imprudence, and partly from the
malevolent opposition of his adversaries, were not attended with
that success which he promised with too sanguine confidence,
they gave rife to various regulations which were of some benefit
to that unhappy people. I return now to the history of the

dent adminifration Cuba became one of the most flourithing of
the Spanish settlements. The fame of this allured many per-
sons from the other colonies thither, in hopes of finding either
some permanent eftabliflment, or some employment for their
ativity. As Cuba lay to the wetl of all the islands occupied by
the Spaniards, and as the ocean, which firetches beyond it to-
wards that quarter, had not hitherto been explored, these cir-
cumftances naturally invited the inhabitants to attempt new dif-
coveries. An expedition for this purpose, in which aivity
and resolution might conduct to sudden wealth, was more
suited to the genius of the age, than the patient induflry requi-
site in clearing ground, and manufacturing sugar. Instigatcd
by this spirit, several officers, who had served under Pedrarias
in Darien, entered into an aociation to undertake a voyage of
discovery. Thley persuaded Francisco Hernandez Cordova,
an opulent planter in Cuba, and a man of diflinguilhced
coulrage, to join with them in tlh adventure, and chose hinl
to be their commander. Velalqlnez not only approved of
the dcflgn, hut alfilctd in carrying it on. As the veterans

---.J chief pilot, Antonio Alaminos, who had served under the sirs
i'7' admiral Columbus, they flood direCtly weft, relying on the

opinion of that great navigator, who uniformly maintained
that a weflerly course would lead to the most important disco-
veries.

ON the twenty-firft day after their departure from St. Jago,

they saw land, which proved to be Cape Catoche, the eaftera
point of that large peninsula projeting from the continent of
'vcaran. America, which still retains its original name of 2ucatan. As

they approached the hore, five canoes came off full of people
decently clad in cotton garments; an astonishing fpeCacle to
the Spaniards, who had found every other part of America
polfeffed by naked savages. Cordova endeavoured by small
presents to gain the good-will of these people. They, though
amazed at the strange objects now preented for the first time to
.their view, invited the Spaniards to visit their habitations, with
an appearance of cordiality. They landed accordingly, and as
they advanced into the country, they observed with new won-
der ome large houses built with flone. But they oon found
that, if the people of Yucatan had made progress in improve-
*ment beyond their countrymen, they were likewise more artful
and warlike. For though the Cazique received 'Cordova with
many tokens of friendship, he had polled a considerable body of
his fubjets in ambush behind a thicket, who, upon a signal
given by him, rushed out and attacked the Spaniards with
great boldncrs, and some degree of martial order. At the first
flight of their arrows, fifteen of the Spaniards were wounded;
ilt the Indians were firuck with such terror by the sudden ex-
plosion of the fire-arms, and so surprised at the execution done

by them, by the cross-bows, and by the other weapons of their B o O
new enemies, that they fled precipitately. Cordova quitted a
country where.he had met with such a fierce reception, carry- - 520'
ing off two prisoners, together with the ornaments of a linall
temple, which he plundered in his retreat.

but the Spaniards were much surprised that on all the extensive
coast along which they had failed, and which they imagined to
be a large island, they had not observed any river'. As tliir
water began to fail, they advanced, in hopes of finding a fuip-
ply; and at length they discovered the mouth of a river at Po-
tonchan, some leagues beyond Campeachy.

CORDOVA landed all his troops in order to protc the sailors

while employed in filling the caiks; but notwitllhanding this
precaution, the natives rushed down upon them with such fil y,
and in such numbers, that forty-feven of the Spaniards wcre
killed upon the spot, and one man only of the whole body
ofcaped unhurt. Their commander, though wounded in
twelve different places, directed the retreat with presence of
mind equal to the courage with which he had led them on in
the engagement, and with much difficulty they regained their
ihips. After this fatal repulse, nothing remained but to haflcn
back to Cuba with their hattered forces. In their patiFge
thither they suffered the most exquisite diftrels for want of

NOT WITHSTANDING the disastrous conclusion of this expe-

dition, it contributed rather to animate than to damp a spirit of
Voyage of enterprize among the Spaniards. They had discovered an ex-

tensive country, situated at no great distance from Cuba, fertile
in appearance, and possessed by a people far superior in im-
provement to any hitherto known in America. Though they
had carried on little commercial intercourse with the natives,
they had brought off Come ornaments of gold, not considerable
in value, but of singular fabric. These circumstances, re-
lated with the exaggeration natural to men desirous of height-
ening the merit of their own exploits, were more than sufficient
to excite romantic hopes and expeSations. Great numbers
offered to engage in a new expedition. Velasquez, solicitous
to diflinguifh himself by ome service o meritorious, as might
entitle him to claim the government of Cuba independent of
the admiral, not only encouraged'their ardour, but at his own
expence fitted out four ihips for the voyage. Two hundred
and forty volunteers, among whom were several persons of
rank and fortune, embarked in this enterprise. The command
of it was given to Juan de Grijalva, a young man of known
merit and courage, with inftru:ions to observe with attention
the nature of the countries which he houltd discover to barter
fir gold, and if circumstances were inviting, to fettle a colon)

Cozuzmel, to the eafi of Yucatan. As all the inhabitants fled to Ma
the woods and mountains at the approach of thl Spaniards, they
made no long stay there, and without any remarkable occur-
rence they reached Potonchan on the opposite fide of the pe-
ninfula. The desire of avenging their countrymen who had
been slain there, concurred with their ideas of good policy, in
prompting them to land, that they might chaflife the Indians
of that diftrit with such exemplary rigour, as would strike
terror into all the people around them. But though they dif-
embarked all their troops, and carried ashore ome field-pieces,
the Indians fought with such courage, that the Spaniards
gained the vitory with difficulty, and were confirmed in their
opinion that the inhabitants of this country would prove more
formidable enemies than any they had met with in other parts
of America. From Potonchan, they continued their voyage
towards the weft, keeping as near as poflible to the hore, and
casting anchor every evening, from dread of the dangerous ac-
cidents to which they might be exposed in an unknown sea.
During the day, their eyes were turned continually towards
land, with a mixture of surprise and wonder at the beauty of
the country, as well as the novelty of the objets which they
beheld. Many villages were scattered along the coast, in which
they could diflinguifll houses of lfone that appeared white and
lofty at a diflance. In the warmth of their admiration, they
fancied there to be cities adorned with towers and pinacles; and
one of the soldiers happening to remark that this country re-

June 9. America. They landed in a river which the natives called
Tabasco.

Tabasco, and the fame of their viory at Potonchan having
reached this place, the cazique not only received them amica-
bly, but beflowed presents upon them of such value, as con-
firmed the high ideas which the Spaniards had formed with
refped to the wealth and fertility of the country. These ideas
were raised still higher by what occurred at the place where
they next touched. This was considerably to the weft of Ta-
Guaxaca. bafco, in the province since known by the name of Guaxaca.

There they were received with refped paid to superior be-
ings. The people perfumed them as they landed with incense
of gum copal, and presented to them as offerings the choicest
delicacies of their country. They were extremely fond of
trading with their new visitants, and in fix days the Spaniards
obtained ornaments of gold, of curious workmanship, to the
value of fifteen thousand pesos, in exchange for European toys
of fiall price. The two prisoners whom Cordova had brought
from Yucatan, had hitherto served as interpreters ; but as they
did not undcrland the language of this country, the Spaniards
learned from the natives by signs, that they were fubjeds o a
great monarch callce Montezuma, whole dominion extended
over that and many other provinces. Leaving this place, wvith
'which he had so much reason to be pleased, Grijalva continued
]ue 1i9. his course towards the wcfl. I-Ie landcd on a finall island,

which he named the Ic of Sacrilices, bccaufe there the Spa-

which he called St. John de Ulua. From this place he dif- B 00
patched Pedro de Alvarado, one of his officers, to Velasquez, ---
with a full account of the important discoveries which he had 5
made, and with all the treasure that he had acquired by traf-
sicking with the natives. After the departure of Alvarado, he
himself, with the remaining vessels, proceeded along the coast
as far as the river Panuco, the country flill appearing to be well
peopled, fertile, and opulent.

SEVERAL of Grijalva's officers contended, that it was not Reasons for

enough to have discovered those delightful regions, or to have ncolavthrg
performed, at their different landing-places, the empty cere-
mony of taking possession of them for the crown of Castile,
and that their glory was incomplete, unless they planted a co-
lony in ome proper flation, which might not only secure the
Spanish nation a footing in the country, but, with the rein-
forcements which they were certain of receiving, might gra-
dually subjed the whole to the dominion of their sovereign.
But the squadron had now been above five months at ea; the
greatest part of their provisions was exhausted, and what re-
mained of their stores so much corrupted by the heat of the
climate, as to be almost unfit for use; they had loft some men
by death; others were sickly; the country was crowded with
people who seemed to be intelligent as well as brave; and they
were under the government of one powerful monarch, who
could bring them to a against their invaders with united
force. To plant a colony under so many circumflances of dif-
advantage, appeared a scheme too perilous to be attemptted.
Grijalva, though possessed both of ambition and courage, was
destitute of the superior talents capable of forming or executing
such a great plan. He judged it more prudent to return to

I i a Cuba,

B 0o 0 Cuba, having fulfilled the purpose of his voyage, and accom-
I- v- plilhed all that the armament which he commanded enabled

' him to perform. He returned to St. Jago de Cuba, on the

twenty-fixth of OCtober, from which he had taken his depar-
ture about fix months before ".

Prcp.nr.n ions TiIS was the longest as well as the most successful voyage
for another
expeditioni. which the Spaniards had hitherto made in the New World.

They had discovered that Yucatan was not an island as they
had supposed, but part of the great continent of America. From
Potonchan they had pursued their course for many hundred
miles along a coast formerly unexplored, firetching at first to-
wards the weft, and then turning to the north; all the country
which they had discovered appeared to be no less valuable than
extensive. As soon as Alvarado reached Cuba, Velasquez,
transported with success so far beyond his most sanguine ex-
pectations, immediately dispatched a person of confidence to
carry this important intelligence to Spain, to exhibit the rich
producions of the countries which had been discovered by his
means, and to solicit such an increase of authority as might en-
able and encourage him to attempt the conquest of them. With-
out waiting for the return of his messenger, or for the arrival
of Grijalva, of whom he was become so jealous or distrustful,
that he resolved no longer to employ.him, he began to prepare
such a powerful armament, as might prove equal to an enter-
prise of so much danger and importance.

BUT as the expedition upon which Velasquez was now in-

tent, terminated in conquests of greater moment than what the

- grandeur than its mountains and rivers. There is nothing in
lakes. other parts of the globe which resembles the prodigious chain

of lakes in North America. They may properly be termed
inland seas of freffi water; and even those of the second or third
class in magnitude, are of laiger circuit (the Caspian ea ex-
cepted) than the greatell lake of the ancient continent.

Its form fa- THE New World is. of a form extremely favourable to com-
ourable to
commerbIce mercial intercourse. When a continent, like Africa, is com-

posed of one vail olid mass, unbroken by arms of the ea pe-
netrating into its interior parts, with few large rivers, and
those at a considerable distance from each other, the greater part
of it seems destined to remain for ever uncivilized,. and to be
debarred from any aive or enlarged communication with the
reft f mankind. When, like Europe, a continent is opened
by inlets of the ocean of vafi extent, such as the Mediterranean
and Baltic;. or when, like Asia, its coait is broken by deep
bays advancing far into the country, such as the Black Sea,
the gulfs of Arabia, of Perlia, of Bengal, of Siam, and of
Leotang; when the surrounding eas are filled with large and
fertile islands, and the continent itself watered with a variety
of navigable rivers, those regions may be said to pollefs what-
ever can facilitate the progress of their inhabitants in com-
merce and improvement. In.all there refpeds America may bear
a comparison with the other quarters of the globe. The gulf
of Mexico, which flows in between North and South America,.
may be confidered as a Mediterranean ea, which opens a ma-
ritime commerce with all the fertile countries by which it is
encircled. The islands fcattcrcd in it are inferior only to those

in

in the Indian Archipelago, in number, in magnitude, and in B o 0 K
value. As we stretch along the northern division of the Ame- .---
rican hemisphere, the Bay of Chefapeak presents a spacious
inlet, which conduas the navigator far into the interior parts
of provinces no less fertile than extensive; and if ever the pro-
grefs of culture and population shall mitigate the extreme
rigour of the climate in the more northern diftrits of America,
Hudson's Bay may become as subservient to commercial inter-
course in that quarter of the globe, as the Baltic is in Europe.
The other great portion of the New World is encompafled on
every fide by the sea, except one narrow neck, which separates
the Atlantic from the Pacific Ocean; and though it be not
opened by spacious bays or arms of the sea, its interior parts
are rendered acceflible by a number of large rivers, fed by o
many auxiliary streams, flowing in such various directions,
that, without any aid from the hand of industry and art, an
inland navigation may be carried on through all the provinces
from the river De la Plata to the gulf of Paria. Nor is this
bounty of Nature confined to the southern division of America;
its northern continent abounds no less in rivers which are na-
vigable almost to their sources, and by its immense chain of
lakes provision is made for an inland communication, more
cxtenfive and commodious than in any quarter of the globe.
The countries firetching from the gulf of Darien on one fide,
to that of California on the other, which form the chain that
binds the two parts of the American continent together, arc
not deflitute of peculiar advantages. Their coast on one fide
is warhed by the Atlantic Ocean, on the other by the Pacific.
Some of their rivers flow into the former, some into the latter,
and fccure to them all the commercial bcucfits that may result
from a communication witl both.

B Ov K BUT what most diflinguifhes America from other parts of

IV.

----' the earth, is the peculiar temperature of its climate, and the
Temperature
of its li- different laws to which it is subjed with refped to the diftribu-
mate. tion of heat and cold. We cannot determine with precision the

portion of heat felt in any part of the globe, merely by mea-
furing its diflance from the equator. The climate of a country
is affeed, in ome degree, by its elevation above the ea, by
the extent of continent, by the nature of the foil, the height
of adjacent mountains, and many other circumstances. The
influence of these, however, is, from various causes, less con-
fiderable in the greater part of the ancient continent; and from
knowing the position of any country there, we can pronounce
with more certainty what will be the warmth of its climate,
and the nature of its productions.

Predomi- THE maxims which are founded upon observation of our
anceofcold, hemisphere will not apply to the other. There, cold predo-

minates. The rigour of the frigid zone extends over half of
that which should be temperate by its position. Countries
where the grape and the fig should ripen, are buried under
snow one half of the year; and lands situated in the fame pa-
rallel with the most fertile and bell cultivated provinces in Eu-
rope, are chilled with perpetual frofis, which almot destroy
the power of vegetation . As we advance to those parts of
America which lie in the fame parallel with provinces of Asia
and Africa, blefled with an uniform enjoyment of such genial
warmth as is molt friendly to life and vegetation, the dominion
of cold continues to be felt, and winter, though during a flort
period, often reigns with extreme fevcrity. If we proceed
along the American continent into the torrid zone, we fliall

find the cold prevalent in the New World extending itself also B 0o K
to this region of the globe, and mitigating the excess of - --'
its fervour. While the negro on the coast of Africa is
scorched with unremitting heat, the inhabitant of Peru breathes
an air equally mild and temperate, and is perpetually shaded
under a canopy of grey clouds, which intercepts the fierce
beams of the fin, without obftrucing his fiiendly influence'.
Along the eafern coast of America, the climate, though more
finilar to that of the torrid zone in other parts of the earth, is
nevertheless confidcrably milder than in those countries of Alia
and Africa which lie in the fame latitude. If from the southern
tropic we continue our progress to the extremity of the Ameri-
can continent, we meet with fiozen seas, and countries hor-
rid, barren, and scarcely habitable for cold, sooner than in the
north .

VARIOUS cauCes combine in rendering the climate of Ame- Causes of

rica so extremely different from that of the ancient continent.
Though the utmost extent of America towards the north be
not yet discovered, we know thai it advances nearer to the
pole than either Europe or Asia. The latter have large seas to
the north, which are open during part of the year; and even
when covered with ice, the wind that blows over them is less
intensely cold than that which lows over land in the fame high
latitudes. But in America the land firctches from the river
St. Laurence towards tlhe pole, and spreads out iinmcnfely to
tlie wcll. A chain of enormous mountains, covered with snow

and:

B 0 0 K and ice, runs through all this dreary region. The wind, in
-.---' passing over such an extent of high and frozen land, becomes

so impregnated with cold, that it acquires a piercing keenness,
which it retains in its progress through warmer climates, and
is not entirely mitigated until it reach the Gulf of Mexico.
Over all the continent of North America, a north-wefRerly wind
and excessive cold are synonymous terms. Even in the most
sultry weather, the moment that the wind veers to that quar-
ter, its penetrating influence is felt in a transition from heat to
.cold, no less violent than fidden. To this powerful cause we
may ascribe the extraordinary dominion of cold, and its violent
inroads into the southern provinces in that part of the globe .

OTHER causes, no less remarkable, diminish the active power

of heat in those parts of the American continent which lie be-
tween-4he tropics. In all that portion of the globe, the wind
blows in an invariable diretion from east to weft. As this
wind holds its course across the ancient continent, it arrives at
the countries which firetch along the western hore of Africa,
inflamed with all the fiery particles which it hath colleced from
the sultry plains of Asia, and the burning sands in the African
defarts. The coast of Africa is, accordingly, the region of the
earth which feels the most fervent heat, and is exposed to the
unmitigated ardour of the torrid zone. But this fame wind
which brings such an acceflion of warmth to the countries lying
between the river of Senegal and Cafraria, travcrfes the Atlan-
tic Ocean before it reaches the American fhorc. It is cooled in
its passage over this vail body of water, and is felt as a rcfrefhl-
ing gale along the coal of Brasil ', and Guiana, rendering

perate, when compared with those which lie opposite to them ----
in Africa i. As this wind advances in its course across America,
it meets with immense plains, covered with impenetrable so-
refis, or occupied by large rivers, marshes, and stagnating
waters, where it can recover no considerable degree of heat.
At length it arrives at the Andes, which run from north to
south through the whole continent. In passing over the ele-
vated and frozen summits, it is so thoroughly cooled, that the
greater part of the countries beyond them hardly feel the ardour
to which they seem exposed by their situation k. In the other
provinces of America, from Tierra Firme westward to the Mex-
ican empire, the heat of the climate is tempered, in ome
places, by the elevation of the land above the sea, in others,
by their extraordinary humidity, and in all, by the enormous
mountains fcatrered over this tract. The islands of America in
the Torrid Zone are either small or mountainous, and are
fanned alternately by refreshing sea and land breezes.

THE causes of the extraordinary cold towards the southern

limits of America, and in the seas beyond it, cannot be afccr-
tained in a manner equally satisfying. It was long supposed
that a vast continent, diftinguifled by the name of Terra
Auifralis Incognita, lay between the southern extremity of
America and the Antartic pole. The fame principles which
account for the extraordinary degree of cold in the northern
regions of America, were employed in ordelcr to explain that
which is felt at Cape Horn and the adjacent countries. The

culiaritx of its situation, and the disposition of its parts, the
next object that merits attention is its condition when firfi dif-
covered, as far as that depended upon the industry and opera-
tions of man. The effects of human ingenuity and labour
are more extensive and considerable, than even our own vanity
is apt at firfl to imagine. When we survey the face of the habi-
table globe, no finall part of that fertility and beauty, which
we ascribe to the hand of Nature, is the work of man. HIis
efforts, when continued through a succession of ages, change
the appearance and improve the qualities of the earth. As a
great part of the ancient continent has long been occupied by
nations far advanced in arts and induflry, our eye is accuflomed
to view the earth in that form which it affliumes when rendered
fit to be the relidence of a numerous race of men, and to supply
themn with nourishment.

vall regions, there were only two monarchies remarkable for cultivated.
exten of territory, or diftinguinfed by any progress in im-
provement. The reft of this continent was polTefied by finall
independent tribes, deflitute of arts and industry, and neither
capable to correct the defecs, nor desirous to meliorate the con-
dition of that part of the earth allotted to them for their habi-
tation. Countries, occupied by such people, were alinoft in the
fame slate as if they had been without inhabitants. Immlenfe
fbrefts covered a great part of the uncultivated earth ; and as
the hand of industry had not taught the rivers to run in a pro-
per channel, or drained off the stagnating water, many of the
most fertile plains were overflowed with inundations, or con-
verted into marflies. In the foutllern provinces, where the
warmth of the fun, the moiflure of the climate, and the fertility
of the foil, combine in calling forth the most vigorous powers of
vegetation, the woods are so choked with its rank luxuriance,
as to be almotf impervious, and the surface of the ground is
hid from the eye under a thick covering of hrubs and ichrbs
and weeds. In this state of wild unassisted nature, a great lpalt
of the large provinces in South America, which cxtcnd fi-om
the bottom of the Andes to the fca, ill remain. The Euro-
pean colonics have cleared and cultivated a few spots along te
coafi, but the original inhabitants, as lrude and indolent as ever,
Lave done nothing to open or improve a co try, pollclling al-
inoll every advantage of lituation and climate. As we advance

No wonder that the colonies fcnt from Europe were alonifhed
at their first entrance into the New World. It appeared to
them waste, solitary, and uninviting. When the English began
to fettle in America, they termed the countries of which they
took pofeffion, ThIe Iildereifs. Nothing but their eager expec-
tation of finding mines of gold, could have induced the Spa-
niards to penetrate through the woods and marshes of America,
where, at every flep, they observed the extreme difference be-
tween the uncultivated face of Nature, and that which it ac-
quires under the forming hand of industry and art".

arise fiom the waters; the surface of the earth, loaded with
rank vegetation, feels not the purifying influence of the fun;
the malignity of the distempers natural to the climate increases,
and new maladies no less noxious are engendered. Accord-
ingly, all the provinces of America, when first discovered,
were found to be remarkably unhealthy. This the Spa-
niards experienced in every expedition into the New World,
whether defined for conquest or settlement. Though by

Great numbers were cut off by the unknown and violent difeales
with which they were infeCted. Such as survived the defiruc-

effects of the climate. They returned to Europe, according to

The principle of life seems to have been less active and vi-
gorous there, than in the ancient continent. Notwithstanding
the vast extent of America, and the variety of its climates, the
different species of animals peculiar to it are much fewer in
proportion, than those of the other hemisphere. In the islands,
there were only four kinds of quadrupeds known, the largefl of
which did not exceed the size of a rabbit. On the continent,
the variety was greater; and though the individuals of each
kind could not fail of multiplying exceedingly, when almofl
unmolested by men, who were neither so numerous, nor so
united in society, as to be formidable enemies to the animal
creation, the number of ditinct species must still be confidered
as extremely small. Of two hundred different kinds of ani-

'-- ' not only less prolific in the New World, but he appears like-

wife to have been less vigorous in her productions. The ani-
nmals originally belonging to this quarter of the globe appear to
be of an inferior race, neither so robust, nor so fierce, as those of
the other continent. America gives birth to no creature of such
bulk as to be compared with the elephant or rhinoceros, or that
equals the lion and tyger in firength and ferocity P. The Tapyr
of Brasil, the largest quadruped of the ravenous tribe in the
New World, is not larger than a calf of fix months old.
The Puma and yaguar, its fiercest beasts of prey, which the
Europeans have inaccurately denominated lions and tygers,
poflels neither the undaunted courage of the former, nor the
ravenous cruelty of the latter q. They are inadive and timid,
hardly formidable to man, and often turn their backs upon the
least appearance of resistance . The fame qualities in the cli-
mate of America which stinted the growth, and enfeebled the
spirit, of its native animals, have proved pernicious to such as
have migrated into it voluntarily from the other continent, or
have been transported thither by the Europeans'. The bears,
the wolves, the deer of America, are not equal in size to those
of the Old World '. Most of the domestic animals, with which
the Europeans florcd the provinces wherein they fettled, have

B 0 0 K THE birds of the New World are not diflinguilhed by qua-

AV.
^-^- lities so conspicuous and charaderiflical, as those which we

Bd have observed in its quadrupeds. Birds are more independent of

man, and less affeced by the changes which his industry and
labour make upon the Rate of the earth. They have a greater
propensity to migrate from one country to another, and can
gratify this inflina of their nature without difficulty or danger.
Hence the number of birds common to both continents is much
greater than that of quadrupeds; and even such as are peculiar
to America nearly resemble those with which mankind were ac-
quainted in similar regions of the ancient hemisphere. The
American birds of the torrid zone, like those of the fame cli-
mate in Asia and Africa, are decked in plumage, which dazzles
the eye with the vivid beauty of its colours; but nature, satis-
sied with clothing them in this gay dress, has denied moil of
them that melody of found, and variety of notes, which catch
and delight the ear. The birds of the temperate climates
there, in the fame manner as in our continent, are less fplen-
did in their appearance, but, in compensation for that defect,
have all the power and sweetness of music in their voice. In
orne difricts of America, the unwholesome temperature of the
air seems to be unfavourable even to this part of the creation.
The number of birds is less than in other countries, and the
traveller is fhruck with the amazing solitude and silence of its
forests . It is remarkable, however, that America, where the qua-
drupeds are so dwarfifh and daflardly, should produce the Condor,

course be extremely vaiious. In each of its provinces, we hall
find tome dillinguifhing peculiarity, the dcription of which
belongs to those who swrite their particular hiflory. In gene-
ral, we may obierve, that the moisture and cold, which pre-
dominate so remarkably in all parts of America, must have
great influence upon the nature of its foil; countries lying in
the fame parallel with those regions which never feel the ex-
treme rigour of winter in the ancient continent, are frozen
over in America during a great part of the year. Chilled
by this intense cold, the ground never acquires warmth sus-
ficient to ripen the fruits, which are found in the correspond-
ing parts of the other continent. If we would rear in Ame-
rica the producions which abound in any particular diflril:
of the world, we must advance several degrees nearer to the
line, than in the other hemisphere, as it requires such an in-
crease of heat to counterbalance the natural frigidity of the foil
and climate '. At the Cape of Good Hope, several of the plants,
and fruits peculiar to the countries within the tropics, are culti-
vated with success; whereas, at St. Augufiine, in Florida, and
Charles-Town, in South-Carolina, though considerably nearer
the line, they cannot bc brought to thrive with equal certainty'.
But, if allowance be made for this divcrfity, the foil of America
is naturally as rich and fertile as in any part of the earth. As

by their consumption. The vegetable productions, to which the
fertility of the foil gave birth, often remained untouched, and
being suffered to corrupt on its surface, returned with increase
into its bosom ". As trees and plants derive a great part of their
nouriflment from air and water, if they were not destroyed by
man and other animals, they would render to the earth more,
perhaps, than they take from it, and feed rather than impoverish
it. Thus the unoccupied foil of America might go on enrich-
ing for many ages. The vass number as well as enormous
size of the trees in America, indicate the extraordinary vigour
of the foil in its native slate. When the Europeans first began
to cultivate the New World, they were atonifhed at the luxu-
iant power of vegetation in its virgin mould; and in several
places the ingenuity of the planter is still employed in diminifli-
ing and wafting its fiperfluous fertility, in order to bring it
down to a state fit for useful culture .

the period of authentic hiflory is extremely short, and every
thing prior to that is fabulous or obscure. It is not fur-
prifing, then, that the unlettered inhabitants of America, who
have no solicitude about futurity, and little curiosity concerning
what is pail, should be altogether unacquainted with their own
original. The Californians and Efkimaux, in particular, who
occupy those countries in America which approach nearest to
the ancient continent, are so remarkably rude, that it is alto-
gether vain to search among them for such information as
might discover the place from whence they came, or the an-
ceftors of whom they are descended '. Whatever light has been
thrown on this subjea, is derived, not from the natives of
America, but from. the inquisitive genius of their conquerors.

refute them. Some have presumptuously imagined, that the
people of America were not the offspring of the fame common
parent wiih the reft of mankind, but that they formed a fepa-
rate race of men, distinguishable by peculiar features in the
conflitution of their bodies, as well as in the charaderiftic qua-
lities of their minds. Others contend, that they are descended
from some remnant of the antediluvian inhabitants of the earth,
who survived the deluge, which swept away the greatest part
of the human species in the days of Noah; and prepofleroufly
luppofe rude,. uncivilized tribes, scattered over an uncultivated
continent, to be the mol ancient race of people on the earth,
There is hardly any nation from the north to the south pole, to
which. some antiquary, in the extravagance of conjecture, has
not ascribed the honour of peopling America. The Jews, the
Canaanites, the Phcenicians, the Carthaginians, the Greeks,
the Scythians in ancient times, are supposed to have fettled in
this western. world. The Chinese, the Swedes, the Norwe-
gians, the Welfl, the Spaniards, are said to have sent colonies
thither in later ages, at different periods, and on various occa-
sions. Zealous advocates fland forth to support the respective
claims of those people; and though they reft upon no better
foundation than the casual resemblance of some cultoms, or the
supposed affinity between a few words in their different lan-
guages, much erudition and more zeal have been employed, to
little purpose, in defence of the opposite fyfRems. Those re-
gions of conjeaure and controversy belong not to the hiflorian.

by certain or highly probable evidence. Beyond this I flall '-----
not venture, in offering a few observations, which may con-
tribute to throw some light upon this curious and much agitated
question.

i. THERE are authors who have endeavoured by mere con- Ought not to

jeeures to account for the peopling of America. Some have b fonleudc
supposed that it was originally united to the ancient con- jeiture
tinent, and disjoined from it by the hock of an earthquake,
or the irruption of a deluge. Others have imagined, that ome
vessel being forced from its course by the violence of a westerly
wind, might be driven by accident towards the American coast,
and have given a beginning to population in that desolate con-
tinent . But with refped to all those systems, it is vain either
to reason or inquire, because it is impoflible to come to any
decision. Such events as they suppose are barely poflible, and
may have happened. That they ever did happen, we have no
evidence, either from the clear teflimony of history, or from
the obscure intimations of tradition.

fame pafiions will animate them, and the fame ideas and fen-
tinents will arise in their minds. The charater and occupa-
tions of the hunter in America must be little different from
those of an Asiatic, who depends for subsistence on the chace.
A tribe of savages on the banks of the Danube mull nearly
resemble one upon the plains wafled by the Miffifippi. Instead
then of prcfuming from this similarity, that there is any affi-
nity between them, .we should only conclude, that the difpo-
fition and manners of men are formed by their situation, and
arise from the slate of society in which they live. The mo-
ment that begins to vary, the character of a people mufl change.
In proportion as it advances in improvement, their manners
refine, their powers and talents are called forth. In every part
of the earth the progress of man hath been nearly the fame,
and we can trace him in his career from the rude simplicity of
savage life, until he attains the indufiry, the arts, and the ele-
gance of polished society. There is nothing wonderful then in.
the similitude between the Americans and the barbarous na-
tions of our continent. Had Lafitau, Garcia, and many other
authors, attended to this, they would not have perplexed a sub-
jec which they pretend to illustrate, by their fruitltfs endeavours
to eablifh an affinity between various races of people in the
old and new continents, upon no other evidence than such a re-
femnblance in their manners as necessarily arises from the fimila-
rity of their condition. There are, it is true, among every people
ibme cufoQms, which, as they do not flow from any natural want
or dcfire pcculiar to their situation, may be denominated usages
of arbitrary inffitution. If between two nations fettled in remote

parts

parts of the earth, a perfet agreement with refpet to any of B K
these should be discovered, one might be led to fufpe that A-_--'
they were conneaed by ome affinity. If a nation were found
in America that consecrated the seventh day to religious reft, if
in another the first appearance of the new moon was celebrated
with festivity, we might justly suppose that the former had de-
rived its knowledge of this usage of arbitrary inflitution from
the Jews, while the monthly feflival of the latter might be con-
fidered as nothing more than an expression of joy natural to man
on the return of the planet which guides and cheers him in the
night. The instances of customs, merely arbitrary, common
to the inhabitants of both hemispheres, are, indeed, so few and
so equivocal, that no theory concerning the population of the
New World ought to be founded upon them.

3. THE theories which have been formed with rfped to orofrrliiou

the original of the Americans, from observation of their re- r';5'
ligious rites and practices, are no less fanciful, and destitute of
solid foundation. When the religious opinions of any people
are neither the result of rational inquiry, nor derived from the
infiruations of revelation, they nuft needs be wild and extra-
vagant. Barbarous nations are incapable of the former, and
have not been blessed with the advantages arising from the
latter. Still, however, the human mind, even where its ope-
rations appear most wild and capricious, holds a course so re-
gular, that in every age and country the dominion of parti-
cular passions will be attended with finilar effects. The fa-
vagc of Europe or America, when filled with fuperflitious dread
of invifiblc beings, or with inquilitive solicitude to penetrate
into the events of fiuturity, trembles alike with fear, or.
glows with impatience. le has recourse to rites and practiccs

6 of

B °0 K of the fame kind, in order to avert the vengeance which he
',_----' uppofes to be impending over him, or to divine the secret

which is the object of his curiosity. Accordingly, the ritual
of fuperfition, in one continent, seems, in many particulars,
to be a transcript of that eflablifhed in the other, and both au-
thorife irnilar institutions, ometimes so frivolous as to excite
pity, ometimes so bloody and barbarous as to create horror.
But without fppoling any consanguinity between such distant
nations, or imagining that their religious ceremonies were
conveyed by tradition from the one to the other, we may ascribe
this uniformity, which in many inflances seems very amazing,
to the natural operation of superstition and enthusiasm upon the
weakness of the human mind.

Not peopled 4. WE may lay it down as a certain principle in this in-
by any nation
highly civil- quiry, that America was not peopled by any nation of the an-
ized, cient continent, which had made considerable progress in civili-

zation. The inhabitants of the New World were in a slate
of society so extremely rude, as to be unacquainted with those
arts which are the firfl essays of human ingenuity in its ad-
vance towards improvement. Even the most cultivated nations
of America were firangers to many of those simple inventions,
which were almost coeval with society in other parts of the world,
and were known in the earliefl periods of civil life. From this it
is manifef, that the tribes which originally migrated to America,
came off from nations which muftt have been no less barbarous
than their poflerity, at the time when they were firfl discovered
,by the Europeans. For, although the elegant and refined arts
may decline or perilli, amidfl the violent flocks of those revo-
lJtions and disasters to which nations are exposed, the necefiary
arts of life, when once they have been introduced among any

people,

people, are never loft. None of the viciflitudes in human B 0 0 K

affairs assec these, and they continue to be praftifed as long as . --_
the race of men exists. If ever the use of iron had been known
to the savages of America, or to their progenitors, if ever they
had employed a plough, a loom, or a forge, the utility of those
inventions would have preserved them, and it is impossible that
they should have been abandoned or forgotten. We may con-
clude then, that the Americans sprung from some people, who
were themselves in such an early and unimproved flage of so-
ciety, as to be unacquainted with all the necefary arts, which
remained unknown among their posterity.

5. IT appears no less evident, that America was not peopled nor from the

southern rc-

by any colony from the more southern nations of the ancient gionsofour
continent. None of the rude tribes fettled in that part of our continent-
hemisphere can be supposed to have visited a country so remote.
They possessed neither enterprise, nor ingenuity, nor power,
that could prompt them to undertake, or enable them to per-
form, such a distant voyage. That the more civilized nations in
Asia or Africa are not the progenitors of the Americans is ma-
nifeft, not only from the observations which I have already
made concerning their ignorance of the most simple and necef-
faryarts, but from an additional circumflance. Whenever any
people have experienced the advantages which men enjoy, by
their dominion over the inferior animals, they can neither subsist
without the nourishment which there afford, n carry on any
considerable operation independent of their ministry and labour.
Accordingly, the sirss care of the Spaniards when they fettlcce
in America, was to flock it with all the domielic animals of
Europe, and if prior to them, the Tyrians, the Cairthaginians,
the Chinese, or any other polisheJ people, had taken pouflion

8 of

B v K of that continent, we should have found there the animals pe-

IV.
t...- - culiar to those regions of the globe where they were originally

feated. In all America, however, there is not one animal, tame
or wild, which properly belongs to the warm, or even the
more temperate countries of the ancient continent. The camel,
the dromedary, the horse, the cow, were as much unknown in
America, as the elephant or the lion. From which it is ob-
vious, that the people who first fettled in the weflern world did
not issue from the countries where those animals abound, and
where men, from having been long accuRomed to their aid,
would naturally confider it, not only as beneficial, but as indif-
penfably necessary to the improvement, and even the preferva-
tion, of civil society.

Thetwocon- 6. FROM confidering the animals with which America is
tinents seem
to approach flored, we may conclude that the nearest poiit of contad be-
nearel to
each other tween the old and new continents is towards the northern ex-
towrds the tremity of both, and that there the communication was opened,

and the intercourse carried on between them. All the exten-
five countries in America which lie within the tropics, or ap-
proach near to them, are filled with indigenous animals of
various kinds, entirely different from those in the correspond-
ing regions of the ancient continent. But the northern pro-
vinces of the New World abound with many of the wild ani-
mals which are common in such parts of our hemisphere as lie
in a similar situation. The bear, the wolf, the fox, the hare,
the deer, the roebuck, the elk, and several other species fre-
quent the forests of North America, no less than those in the
north of Europe and Asia . It seems to be evident then, that

tained by

eflablifhed by modern discoverics, that the chief difficulty with difcovcry.
refpea to the peopling of America is removed. While those
immense regions, which stretched eaflward from the river Oby
to the sea of Kamchatka were unknown, or imperfectly ex-
plored, the north-east extremities of our hemisphere were sup-
posed to be so far distant from any part of the New World,
that it was not easy to conceive how any communication flould
have been carried on between them. But the Ruffians, having
fubjeed the weflern part of Siberia to their empire, gradually
extended their knowledge of that vast country, by advancing
towards the east into unknown provinces. These were disco-
vered by hunters in their excursions after game, or by soldiers
employed in levying the taxes, and the court of Moscow elti-
mated the importance of those countries only by the small addi-
tion which they made to its revenue. At length, Peter the Great
ascended the Ruffian throne. I-s enlightened, comprehensive
mind, intent upon every circumflance that could aggrandize his
empire, or render his reign illustrious, discerncd conltquences of
those discoverics, which had cfcaped the obfcrvation of Ilis igno-
rant prcdeccflors. He perceived, that in proportion as the re-
gions of Alia extended towards the carl, they mull approach
nearer to America; tlat the communication between the two
continents, which had long been searchcd for in vain, wulcl
probably be fund i tlis iquarter, andt-tilat by openilng tilis

_- _
--I grand schemes. Peter drew up initruaions with his own hand

for prosecuting this design, and gave orders for carrying it into
execution'.

His fuccefiors adopted his ideas, and pursued his plan.

The officers whom the Ruffian court employed in this service,
had to struggle with so many difficulties, that their progress
was extremely flow. Encouraged by some faint traditions
among the people of Siberia, concerning a successful voyage in
the year one thousand fix hundred and forty-eight, round the
north-eat promontory of Asia, they attempted to follow the
fame course. Vessels were fitted out, with this view, at dif..
ferent times, from the rivers Lena and Kolyma; but in a frozen
ocean, which nature seems not to have destined for navigation,
they were exposed to many difaflers, without being able to
accomplish their purpose. No vessel fitted out by the Ruffian
court ever doubled this formidable Cape k; we are indebted for
what is known of those extreme regions of Asia, to the disco-
veries made in excursions by land. In all those provinces, an
opinion prevails, that countries of great extent and fertility lie
at no considerable distance from their own coafls. These the
Ruffians imagined to be part of America; and several circum-
stances concurred not only in confirming them in this belief,
but in persuading them that some portion of that continent
could not be very remote. Trees of various kinds, unknown
in those naked regions of Alia, are driven upon the coast by
an eaflerly wind. By the fame wind, floating ice is brought
thither in a few days; flights of birds arrive annually from the

an intercourse formerly carried on with some countries situated '---,,
to the east.

AFTER weighing all these particulars, and comparing the

position of the countries in Asia which had been discovered,
with such parts in the north-west of America as were already
known, the Ruffian court formed a plan, which would have
hardly occurred to any nation less accustomed to engage in ardu-
ous undertakings, and to contend with great difficulties. Or-
ders were issued to build two vessels at Ochotz, in the sea of
Kamchatka, to fail on a voyage of discovery. Though that
dreary uncultivated region furnished nothing that could be of
use in conftruating them, but ome larch trees; though not
only the iron, the cordage, the fails, and all the numerous
articles requisite for their equipment, but tle provisions for
victualling them, were to be carried through the immense de-
ferts of Siberia, along rivers of difficult navigation, and roads
almost impassable, the mandate of the sovereign, and the per-
severance of the people, at last surmounted every obltacle. Two 174r.
vefcels were finished, and, under the command of the captains J
Behring and Tfchirikow, failed from Kamchatka in quell of
the New World, in a quarter where it had never been ap-
proached. They flaped their course towards the call; and
though a storm soon separated the vessels, which never rejoined,
and many disasters befcl them, the expectations from the voy-
age were not altogether fruflrated. Each of the commanders
discovered land, which to them appeared to be part of the Amc-
rican continent; and, according to their oblervations, it seems
to be situated within a few degrees of the north-wefl coast of
California. Each set some of his peoplc aflorc; but in one

N n 2 place

B o0 K place the inhabitants fled as the Ru'ians approached; in

i---.- another, they carried off those who landed, anddeftroyed their

boats. The violence of the weather, and the distress of their
crews, obliged both to quit this inhospitable coast. In their
return they touched at fcveral islands, which firetch in a chain
from east to welt between the country which they had dif-
covered and the coafi of Adia, They had ome intercourse witIh
the natives, who seemed to them to resemble the North Ame-
ricans. They presented to the Ruffians the caliimet, or pipe of
peace, which is a ymbol of friendship universal among the
people of North America,. and an usage of arbitrary inflitution,
peculiar to them.

THE islands of this new Archipelago have been frequented

by te Ruffian hunters since that time; but the court seemed
to have relinquished its scheme of prosecuting discoveries in
this quarter. It was unexpectedly resumed in the year one
thousand seven hundred and fixty-eight, and captain Krenitzin
had the command of two small vessels fitted out for that pur-
pose. In his voyage outward he held nearly the fame course
with the former navigators, he touched at the fame ilands,
observed their situation and producions more carefully, and
discovered several new illands, with which they had not fallen
in. Though he did not proceed so far to the east as to revilit
the country which Behring and Tfchirikow supposed to be part
of the American continent, yet, by returning in a course con-
fiderably to the north of theirs, he correaed tome capital mif-
takes into which they had fallen, and has contributed to faci-
litate the progress of future navigators in those seas '.

Sec NOTE XLI.

Th us

THus the possibility of a communication between the conti- B 0 K

nents in this quarter refis no longer upon mere conjedure, but I
is established by undoubted evidence m. Some tribe, or iome fa-
milies of wandering Tartars, from the refllefs spirit peculiar to
their race, might migrate to the nearest islands, and, rude as
their knowledge of navigation was, might, by palling from one
to the other, reach at length the coast of America, and give a
beginning to population in that continent. The distance be-
tween the Marian or Ladrone islands and the nearest land ia
Asia, is greater than that between the part of America which
the Ruffians difcovcred, and the coast of Karchatka ; and yet
the inhabitants of those illands are manifeflly of Asiatic extra2.
If, notwithflanding their remote situation, we admit that the
Marian islands were peopled fiom our continent, diflance alone
is no reason why we fould hesitate about admitting that
the original of the Americans may be fiom the fame source.
It is probable that future navigators in those seas, by fleer-
ing farther to the north, may find that the continent of Ame-
rica approaches fill nearer to Asia. According to the in-
formation of the barbarous people, who inhabit the country
about the north-caft promontory of Alia, there lies, off the
coalt, a small illand, to which they iail in less than a day. Froml
that, they can dfcry a large continent, which, according to
their delcription, is coverced witli forcfls, and pofl'cfled by people
whose language they do not undcrlland ". By thein tiey ae

the fovercign now feated on the throne of Peter the Great, who,
by perfeding his plan, may add this splendid event to thole
which already distinguish her reign.

Anothelcorr.- IT is likewise evident from recent discoveries, that an inter-
Intin ication

y tnort'- course between our continent and America might be carried on
welt. with no lets facility from the north-west extremities of Europe.
A.D. 830. As early as the ninth century, the Norwegians discovered

Greenland, and planted colonies there. The communication
with that country, after a long interruption, was renewed in
the last century. Some Lutheran and Moravian miflionarics,
prorQpted by zeal for propagating the Christian faith, have
ventured to fettle in this frozen and uncultivated region °.
To them we are indebted for much curious information with
refpeft to its nature and inhabitants. We learn, that the north-
well coast of Greenland is separated from America by a very
narrow strait; that, at the bottom of the bay into which this
strait conducts, it is highly probable .that they are united P; that
the inhabitants of the two countries have ome intercourse with
one another; that the Efquimaux of America perfectly refem-
ble the Greenlanders in their aflpeC , dress, and mode of living;
that some sailors, who had acquired the knowledge of a few
words in the Greenlandill language, reported that thee were

aflonifhment, that they spoke the fame language with the B 0 K

IV,

Greenlanders, and were in every refped the fame people, and -
he was accordingly received and entertained by them as a friend
and a brother .

BY these decifve fads, not only the consanguinity of the

Efquimaux and Greenlanders is established, but the possibility
of peopling America from the north of Europe is demonitrated.
If the Norwegians, in a barbarous age, when science had not
begun to dawn in the north of Europe, poffelfed such naval
skill as to open a communication with Greenland, their ancef-
tors, as much addited to roving by sea, as the Tartars are to
wandering by land, might, at ofme more remote period, ac-
complifh the fame voyage, and fettle a colony there, whose de-
fcendents might, in progress of time, migrate into America.
But if, initead of venturing to fail directly from their own
coast to Greenland, we suppose that the Norwegians held a
more cautious course, and advanced from Shetland to the Feroe
Islands, and from them to Iceland, in all which they had planted
colonies, their progress may have been so gradual, that this
navigation cannot be confidered as either longer or more ha-
zardous, than those voyages which that hardy and enterprising
race of men is known to have performed in every age.

8. TOUGcI it be possible that America may have received Probably

its first inhabitants from our continent, either by the north-west t heorth-caf
of Europe or the north-east of Asia, there seems to be good
reason for supposing that the progenitors of all the American
uations, from Cape Horn to the southern confines of Labrador,

1 Crantz' Iin. of Grecnl p. p 261, 62.

igratec

B v0 migrated from the latter rather than the former. The Efqui-
L _---- maux are the only people in America, who, in their afpe or

character, bear any resemblance to the northern Europeans.
They are manifestly a separate species of men, diftina from
all the nations of the American continent, in language, in dif-
pofi tion, and in habits of life. Their original, then, may war-
rantably be traced up to that source, which I have pointed out.
But, among all the other inhabitants of America, there is such
a striking similitude in the form of their bodies, and the quali-
ties of their minds, that, notwithstanding the diversities occa-
sioned by the influence of climate, or unequal progress in im-
provement, we mull pronounce them to be descended from one
source. There may be a variety in the shades, but we can
every where trace the fame original colour. Each tribe has
Something peculiar which distinguishes it, but in all of them
we discern certain features common to the whole race. It is
remarkable, that in every peculiarity, whether in their persons
or dispositions, which charafterife the Americans, they have some
resemblance to the rude tribes scattered over the north-east of
Asia, but almost none to the nations fettled in the northern ex-
tremities of Europe. We may, therefore, refer them to the for-
mer origin, and conclude that their Asiatic progenitors, having
fettled in those parts of America, where the Ruffians have disco-
vered the proximity of the two continents, spread gradually over
its various regions. This account of the progress of population
in America, coincides with the traditions of the Mexicans con-
cerning their own origin, which, imperfect as they are, were
prclerved with more accuracy, and merit greater credit, than
tho(e of any people in the New World. According to them,
their anceflors came fiom a remote country, situated to the
north-wcl of Mexico. The Mexicans point out their various

flations

stations as they advanced from this, into the interior provinces, B o
and it is precilcly the fame route which they mufl have held, if ---~
they had been emigrants from Asia. The Mexicans, in dcfcrib-
ing the appearance of their progenitors, their manners, and
habits of life at that period, exacly delineate tliofe of the rude
Tartars, from whom I suppose them to have prung.

ThUS have I finished a difluifition which has been deemed

of so much importance, that it would have been improper to
omit it in writing the hiilory of America. I have ventured to
inquire, but without presuming to decide. Satisfied with offer-
ing conjectures, I pretend not to eflablifh any fyfiem. When
an invefligation is, from its nature, so intricate and obscure,
that it is impolsible to arrive at conclusions which are certain,
there may be some merit in pointing out such as are pro-
bable '.

at each period, how the faculties of his underfianding unfold,
we must attend to the efforts of his ative powers, watch the
motions of affection as they rife in his breast, and mark whither
they tend, and with what ardour they are exerted. The phi-
lofophers and historians of ancient Greece and Rome, our
guides in this as well as every other disquisition, had only a
limited view of this subject, as they had hardly any opportu-
nity of surveying man in his rudest and molt early slate. In all
those regions of the earth with which they were well acquainted,
civil society had made considerable advances, and nations had
finishcd a good part of their career before they began to observe
them. The Scythians and Germans, the rudest people of
whQmn any ancient author has transmitted to us an authentic
account, poffeled flocks and herds, had acquired property of
various kinds, and, when compared with mankind in their
primitive fRate, may be reckoned to have attained to a great
degree of civilization.

ifted in the other. The greater part of its inhabitants were B ° O K
strangers to industry and labour, ignorant of arts, and almost .- --
unacquainted with property, enjoying in common the blessings
which flowed fpontaneouny from the bounty of nature. There
were only two nations in this vast continent which had emerged
from this rude state, and had made any considerable progress
in acquiring the ideas, and adopting the inflitutions, which
belong to pofllhed societies. Their government and manners
will fall naturally under our review in relating the discovery
and conquest of the Mexican and Peruvian empires; and we
shall have there an opportunity of contemplating the Ame-
ricans in the state of highest improvement to which they ever
attained.

AT present, our attention and researches hall be turned to This inquiry

confined to

the small independent tribes which occupied every other part of the rudest
America. Among there, though with ome diversity in their tries.
character, their manners and institutions, the state of society
was nearly similar, and so extremely rude, that the denomina-
tion of Savage may be applied to them all. In a general
history of America, it would be highly improper to describe the
condition of each petty community, or to invefligate every
minute circumflancc which contributes to form the character
of its members. Such an inquiry would lead 'to details of
immeasurable and tiresome extent. The qualities belonging
to the people of all the different tribes have such a near refem-
blance, that they may be painted with the fame features. Where
any circumfiances seen to conflitutc a diversity in their cha-
rater and manners worthy of attention, it will be sufficient to
point these out as they occur, and to inquire into the causes of
such peculiarities.

Difficulty of
obtaining in. To discover their true charaaer under this rude form, and to
formation, colle0t the features by which they are diflinguifhed, requires

an observer possessed of no less impartiality than discernment.
For, in every fIage offociety, the faculties, the sentiments and
desires of men are so accommodated to their own state, that
they become standards of excellence to themselves, they affix
the idea of perfecion and happiness to those attainments
which resemble their own, and wherever the objets and en-
joyments to which they have been accuflomed are wanting,
confidently pronounce a people barbarous and miserable.
Hence the mutual contempt with which the members of com-
munities, unequal in their degrees of improvement, regard
each other. Poliflied nations, conscious of the advantages
which they derive from their knowledge and arts, are apt to
view rude nations with peculiar scorn, and, in the pride of fu-
periority, will hardly allow either their occupations, their
feelings, or their pleasures, to be worthy of men. It has fel-
dom been the lot of communities, in their early and unpolifhed
ltate, to fall under the observation of persons, endowed with
force of mind superior to vulgar prejudices, and capable of con-
templating man, under whatever aspe:t he appears, with a can-
did and discerning eye.

capacity of
the frlt ob- opportunity of beholding its various tribes, while entire and
servers, unfubducd, were far from poffefling the qualities requisite for

observing the flriking fpeótacle presented to their view. Nei-
ther the age in which they lived, nor the nation to which
they belonged, had made such progress in true fciencc, as in-

fpircs

spires enlarged and liberal sentiments. The conquerors of the B 0 K
New World were mostly illiterate adventurers, deflitute of all ' --
the ideas which ihould have directed them in contemplating
objects, so extremely different from those with which they
were acquainted. Surrounded continually with danger, or
flruggling with hardfsips, they had little leisure, and leis ca-
pacity for any speculative inquiry. Eager to take poflefion of
a country of such vast extent and opulence, and happy in
finding it occupied by inhabitants so incapable to defend it,
they hastily pronounced them to be a wretched order of men,
formed merely for servitude; and were more employed in com-
puting the profits of their labour, than in inquiring into the
operations of their minds, or the reasons of their customs and
inflitutions. The persons who penetrated at subsequent periods
into the interior provinces, to which the knowledge and de-
vaftations of the firfl conquerors did not reach, were generally
of a similar charader; brave and enterprising in an high de-
gree, but so uninformed as to be little qualified either for obh
serving or describing what they beheld.

NOT only the incapacity, but the prejudices of the Spa- nd thecir prc-

niards, render their accounts of the people of America ex- j c;
tremely defeCtive. Soon after they planted colonies in their
new conquefis, a difference in opinion arose with refpe to the
treatment of the natives. One party, solicitous to render their
servitude perpetual, represented them as a brutifli, obflinate race,
incapable either of acquiring religious knowledge, or of being
trained to the functions of social lifr. The other, full of pious
concern for their conversion, contended that, though rude and
ignorant, they were gentlc, affeionate, docile, and by pro-
per inflrutions and regulations might be formed gradually

into

BO K into good Christians and useful citizens. This controversy, as
e_ - _ I have already related, was carried on with all the warmth

which is natural, when attention to interest on the one hand,
and religious zeal on the other, animate the disputants. Most
of the laity espoused the former opinion; all the ecclesiastics
were advocates for the latter; and we shall uniformly find that,
accordingly as an author belonged to either of these parties,
he is apt to magnify the virtues or aggravate the defects of the
Americans beyond measure. Those repugnant accounts increase
the difficulty of attaining a perfect knowledge of their character,
and render it necessary to peruse all the descriptions of them by
Spanish writers with diftruff, and to receive their information
with ome allowance.

fvllems of
philosophers. rica, before the manners of its inhabitants attracted, in any

considerable degree, the attention ofphilofophers. At length,
they discovered that the knowledge of the condition and cha-
rater of the Americans might enable them to fill up a confi-
derable chasm in the hiflory of the human species, and lead to
speculations no less curious than important. They entered upon
this new field of study with great ardour; but, inflead of
throwing light upon the subjet, they have contributed, in ome
degree, to involve it in additional obscurity. Too impatient to
inquire, they hafctnecl to decide; and bcgan to erc: fyfiemis,
when they should have been fcarching for fats on which to
ellal)lilh their foundations. Struck with the appearance of de-
generacy in te hm11anii fpccies throughout the New World, and

every thing in it bore marks of a recent original; and that its in- <-
habitants, lately called into existence, and still at the beginning
of their career, were unworthy to be compared with the people
of a more ancient and improved continent'. Others have
imagined, that, under the influence of an unkindly climate,
which checks and enervates the principle of life, man never
attained in America the perfection which belongs to his nature,
but remained an animal of an inferior order, defective in the
vigour of his bodily frame, and destitute of sensibility, as well
as of force, in the operations of his mind . In opposition to
both these, other philosophers have supposed that man arrives
at his highest dignity and excellence long before he reaches a
slate of refinement; and, in the rude simplicity of savage life,
displays an elevation of fentirnent, an independence of mind,
and a warmth of attachment, for which it is vain to search
among the members of polished societies . They eem to con-
fider that as the moit perfect tate of man which is the least
civilized. They describe the manners of the rude Americans
with such rapture, as if they proposed them for models to the
reft of the species. These contraditory theories have been
proposed with equal confidence, and uncommon powers of ge-
nius and eloquence have been exerted in order to clothe ther.
with an appearance of truth.

As all those circumfiances concur in rendering an inquiry

into the ftatc of the rude nations in America intricate and ol-
fcure, it is necefTary to carry it on with caution. When guided-

ficial remarks of vulgar travellers, of ailors, traders, bucca-

detached saCs, endeavour to discover what they wanted saga-

a propensity to either system, we mufi fiudy with equal care to
avoid the extremes of extravagant admiration, or of supercilious

individual before he became the member of a community; and
the qualities which belong to him under his former capacity
should be known, before we proceed to examine those which
arise from the latter relation. This is peculiarly necessary in
investigating the manners of rude nations. Their political
union is so incomplete, their civil institutions and regulations
so few, so simple, and of such small authority, that men in this
slate ought .to be viewed rather as independent agents, than as
members of a regular society. The character of a avage results
almost entirely from his fcntiments or feelings as an individual,
and is but little influenced'by his imperfect subjection to govern-
ment and order. I flall conduct my researches concerning the
manners of the Americans in this natural order, proceeding

tion of their

body is lcfs affected by climate than that of any other animal. Lodic.1f
Some animals are confined to a particular region of the globe,
and cannot exist beyond it; others, though they may be brought
to bear the injuries of a climate foreign to them, cease to mul-
tiply when carried out of that difIri&, which Nature dcftined to
be their mansion. Even such as seem capable of being natu-
ralized in various climates, feel the effea of every remove from
their proper flation, and gradually dwindle and degenerate from
the vigour and perfection peculiar to their species. Man is the
only living creature whose frame is at once so hardy and so
flexible, that he can spread over the whole earth, become the
inhabitant of every region, and thrive and multiply under every
climate. Subject, however, to the general law of Nature, the
human body is not entirely exempt from the operation of cli-
mate, and when exposed to the extremes either of heat or cold,
its size or vigour diminishes.

the islands, where four-footed animals were both few and small,
and the earth yielded her p.oductions almtoft spontaneously, the
conffitution of the natives, neither braced by the active exer-
cifes of the chace, nor invigorated by the labour of cultivation,
was extremely feeble and languid. On the continent, where
the forests abound with game of various kinds, and the chief

nore remarkable for agility than firength. They refen. jled
beasts of prey, rather than animals formed for labour a. They
were not only aver'e to toil, but incapable of it; and when
rouzed by force from their native indolence, and compelled to
work, they funk under tasks which the people of the other-
continent would have performed with eafe.b. This feeblcnefs

oF strength. This peculiarity, by which the inhabitants of the B o0 K

IV.

New World are distinguished from the people of all other na- -
tions, cannot be attributed, as ome travellers have supposed, to
their mode of subsistence d. For though the food of many
Americans be so extremely insipid, that they are altogether un-
acquainted with the use of salt, rude tribes in other parts of the
earth have fubfiled on aliments equally simple without this
mark of degradation, or any apparent Iyimptom of a diminu-
tion in their vigour.

As the external form of the Americans leads us to fur- Lefsappe-

pe&t that there is Ibme natural debility in their frame, the t'e.
smallness of their appetite for food has been mentioned by
many authors as a confirmation of this suspicion. The quan-
tity of food which men consume varies according to the
temperature of the climate in which they live, the degree of
activity which they exert, and the natural vigour of their
conflitutions. Under the enervating heat of the torrid zone,
and when men pass their days in indolence and ease, they
require less nourishment than the aive inhabitants of tem-
perate or cold countries. But neither the warmth of their
climate, nor their extreme lazincfs, will account for the un-
co mon defeal of appetite among the Americans. The Spa-
nWards were alloniflhed with observing this, not only in the
islands, but in several parts of the continent. The conflitu-
tional temperince of the natives far exceeded, in their opinion,
the abfltincnc, of the inoft mortified hermits ; wlilc, on the
other hand, the appetite of the Spaniards appeared to the Ame-
ricans insatiably voracious; and they aflirmed, that one Spa-

Lss vehe. A PROOF of some feebleness in their frame ill more itriking,
mence of
desire. is the insensibility of the Americans to the charms of beauty,

and the power of love. That passion which was destined to
perpetuate life, to be the bond of social union, and the source
of tenderness and joy, is the most ardent in the human breast.
Though the perils and hardships of the savage slate, though
excefive fatigue, on ome occasions, and the difficulty at all
times of procuring fubfiptence, may seem to be adverse to this
passion, and to have a tendency to abate its vigour, yet the
rudest nations in every other part of the globe seem to feel its
influence more powerfully than the inhabitants of the New
World. The negro glows with all the warmth of desire na-
tural to his climate; and the noft uncultivated Asiatics dif-
cover that sensibility, which, from their situation, we hould
expeE them to have felt. But the Americans are, in an amazing
degree, strangers to the force of this first inflina of nature.
In every part of the New World the natives treat their women
with coldness and indifference. They are neither the objects
of that tender attachment which takes place in civilized society,
nor of that ardent desire conspicuous among rude nations.
Even in climates where this passion usually acquires its greatest
vigour, the savage of America views his female with disdain,
as an animal of a less noble fpccies. -Ie is at no pains to win
her favour by the afliduity of courtflip, and ill less solicitous

opinion which they entertain with refpe& to the merit of fe-
male chaffity. That is an idea too refined for a savage, and
suggested by a delicacy of sentiment and affection to which he is
a flrangcr.

3UT in inquiries concerning either the bodily or mental Rcfleaions

with repct

qualities of particular races of men, there is not a more corn- to these.
mon or more seducing error, than that of ascribing to a ingle
cause, those characderiftic peculiarities, which are the effect of
the combined operation of many causes. The climate and foil
of America differ, in so many refpeds, from those of the other
hemisphere, and this difference is so obvious and firiking, that
philosophers of great eminence have laid hold on this as fuffi-
cient to account for what is peculiar in the confltitution of its
inhabitants. They reft on physical causes alone, and confider
the feeble frame and languid desire of the Americans, as con-
sequences of the temperament of that portion of the globe
which they occupy. But the influences of political and moral
causes ought not to have been overlooked. These operate with
no less effect than that on wlich many philofoplhers rcfl as a full
explanation of the singular appearances wlicl have been men-
tioned. Wherevcr the slate of focicty is such as to create many
wants and desires, which cannot be satisfied without regu-

--,--.- where the demands of men are so few and so moderate, that

they may be gratified, almost without any effort, by the fpon-
taneous productions of nature, the powers of the body are not
called forth, nor can they attain their proper firength. The
natives of Chili and of North-America, the two temperate re-
gions in the New World, who live by hunting, may'be deemed
an aive and vigorous race, when compared with the inha-
bitants of the isles, or of those parts of the continent where
hardly any labour is requisite to procure fubiftence. The ex-
ertions of a hunter are not, however, so regular, or tb con-
tinued, as those of persons employed in the culture of the earth,
or in the various arts of civilized life, and though his agility
may be greater than theirs, his firength is on the whole in-
ferior.- If another direion were given to the acive powers of
man in the New World, and his force augmented by exercise,
he might acquire a degree of vigour which he does not in his
present state possess. The truth of this is confirmed by expe-
rience. Wherever the Americans have been gradually accuf-
tomed to hard labour, their constitutions become robuf, and
they have been found capable of performing ftch tafls, as
seemed not only to exceed the powers of such a feeble frame as
has been deemed peculiar to their country, but to equal any
effort of the natives, either of Africa or of Europe '.

TIlE fame reasoning will apply to what has been obfcrved

concerning their slender demand for food. As a proof that this
ihould be ascribed, as much to their extreme indolence, and
.often total want of occupation, as to any thing peculiar in the

physical firuaure of their bodies, it has been observed, that in BaO o ;
those difiricts, where the people of America are obliged to -
exert any unusual efFort of ativity, in order to procure ub-
filtence, or wherever they are employed in severe labour, their
appetite is not inferior to that of other men, and, in some
places, it has firuck observers as remarkably voracious k.

THE operation of political and moral causes is flill more

conspicuous, in modifying the degree of attachment between
the sexes. In a state of high civilization, this pafion, inflamed
by restraint, refined by delicacy, and cherished by fashion, oc-
cupies and engrosses the heart. It is no longer a fiunple inflina
of nature; sentiment heightens the ardour of dcfire, and the
inol: tender emotions of which our frame is fufccptible, bootho
and agitate the foul. This dcfcription, however, applies only
to tlofe, who, by their situation, are exempted from the cares
and labours of life. Among persons of inferior order, who.
are doomed by their condition to incessant toil, the dominion
of this passion is less violent; their solicitude to procure sub-
iiftence,.and to provide for the first demand of nature, Icavcs
little leisure for attending to. its second call. But if the nature
of the intercourse between the sexes varies so much in perlons
of different rank in polished focictics, tile condition of man,
while he remains uncivilized, muf occasion a variation nill mlore
apparent. We may well suppose, that amidflt. the hardllips,
the dangers, and the simplicity of savage. life, where lblfiflcnc .
is always precarious, and often scanty, where men are almofl
continually cngaged in the purftuic of their enemies, or in
guardling against tlcir attacks, and where neitlher drcfs nor

B 0 0 ; tention of the Americans to their women would be extremely

., feeble, without imputing this solely to any physical defec or

degradation in their frame.

IT is accordingly observed, that in those countries of Ame-

rica, where, from the fertility of the foil, the mildness of the
climate, or some farther advances which the natives have made
in improvement, the means of subsistence are more abundant,
and the hardships of savage life are less severely felt, the ani-
mal paflion of the exes becomes more ardent. Striking ex-
amples of this occur among some tribes feated on the banks of
great rivers well tfored with food, among others who are ma-
flers of hunting-grounds abounding so much with game, that
they have a regular and plentiful supply of nourishment with
little jabour. The superior degree of security and affluence
which these tribes enjoy, is followed by their natuTal effes.
The passions implanted in the human frame by the hand of na-
ture acquire additional force; new taftes and desires are formed;
the women, as they are more valued and admired, become more
attentive to dress and ornament; the men, beginning to feel how
much of their own happiness depends upon them, no longer dif-
dain the arts of winning their favour and affeaion. The intcr-
course of the sexes becomes very different fiom that which takes
place among their ruder countrymen; and as hardly any refhraint
is imposed on the gratification of desire, either by religion, or
laws, or decency, the dissolution of their manners is excessive '.

symmetry and perfection of their external figure. Some -
authors search for the cause of this appearance in their phy-
fical condition. As the parents are not exhausted or over-
fatigued with hard labour, they suppose that their children
are born vigorous and found. They imagine, that in the
liberty of savage life, the human body, naked and uncofined
from its earliest age, preserves its natural form; and that all
its limbs and members acquire a juffer proportion, than when
fettered with artificial reflraints, which stint its growth, and
distort its shape '. Something, without doubt, may be ascribed
to the operation of these causes; but the true reasons of this
apparent advantage, which is common to all ravage nations,
lie deeper, .and are closely interwoven with the nature and
genius of that state. The infancy of man is so long and so help-
less, that it is extremely difficult to rear children among rude
nations. Their means of fbfiftence are not only scanty, but
precarious. Such as live by hunting muff range over extcnfive
countries, and hist often from place to place. The care of chil-
dren, as well as every other laborious tafl, is devolved upon thl
women. The diftreffcs and hardfllips of the savage life, which
are often such as can hardly be fipportcd l)y perlons in full
vigour, mult be fatal to those of more tender age. Afraid of
undertaking a talk so laborious, and of fucll long duration as;
that of rearing their offspring, the women, in ilinc parts ol'

Even when they endeavour to rear all their children without
diftinaion, so great a proportion of the whole number pe-
rifiles under the rigorous treatment which must be their lot
in the savage slate, that few of those who laboured under
any original frailty attain the age of manhood P. Thus, in
poliflhed focieries, where the means of subsistence are secured
with certainty, and acquired with ease; where the talents of
the mind are often of more importance than the powers of the
body; children are preserved notwithstanding their defects or
deformity, and grow up to be useful citizens. In rude nations,
such persons are either cut off as soon as they are born, or becom-
ing a burden to themselves and to the community, cannot long
protract their lives. But in those provinces of the New World
where, by the eftablilhment of the Europeans, more regular
provision has been made for the subsistence of its inhabitants,
and they are restrained from laying violent hands on their chil-
dren, the Americans are so far from being eminent for any fu-
perior perfecion in their form, that one hould rather fufpea

To their amazement, however, they discovered that America
contained no negroes'; and the cause of this singular appear-
ance became as much the object of curiosity, as the fad itself
was of wonder. In what part or membrane of the body that
humour resides which tinges the complexion of the negro with a
deep black, it is the business of anatomis to inquire and de-
scribe. The powerful operation of heat appears manifeflly to
be the cause which produces this striking variety in the human
species. All Europe, almost the whole of Asia, and the tem-
perate parts of Africa, are occupied by men of a fair com-
plexion. All the torrid zone in Africa, some of the warmer
regions adjacent to it, and a few countries in Aa, are filled
with people of a deep black colour. If we trace the nations of
our continent, making our progress from cold and temperate
countries towards those parts which are exposed to the influence
of vehement and unremitting heat, wefhall find, that the extreme
whiteness of their kin oon begins to diminish; that its colour
deepens gradually as we advance ; and after passing through all
the successive gradations of hade, terminates in an uniform
unvarying black. But in America, where the agency of heat
is checked and abated by various causes, which I have already
explained, the climate seems to be destitute of that force which
produces such wonderful effects on the human fiame. The
colour of the natives of the torrid zone, in America, can hardly
be said to be of a deeper hue than that of the people in the more
temperate parts of their continent. Accurate obfcrvers, who

BUT though the hand of Nature has deviated so little from

one standard in fashioning the human form in America, the
creation of fancy hath been various and extravagant. The
fame fables that were current in the ancient continent, have
been revived with refpcQ to the New World, and America too
has been peopled with human beings of monstrous and fantastic
appearance. The inhabitants of certain provinces were de-
fcribed to be pigmies of three feet high; those of others to be
giants of an enormous size. Some travellers published accounts
of people with only one eye, others pretended to have discovered
men ,without heads, whose eyes and nmouths were planted in
their breasts. The variety of Nature in her productions is,
indeed, so great, that it is presumptuous to set bounds to her ser-
tility, and to rejea indiscriminately every relation that is not per-
fetly consonant to our own limited observation and experience.
But the other extreme, of yielding a hasty assent, on tlde
slightest evidence, to whatever has the appearance of being
strange and marvellous, is no less unbecoming a philosophical
inquirer, as, in every period, men are more apt to be betrayed
into error, by their weakness in believing too much, tha;tn by
their arrogance in believing too little. In proportion as science
extends, and nature is examined with a discerning eye, the
wonders which ainufed ages of ignorance disappear. The tales
of credulous travellers concerning America are forgotten; the
monflers which they delcribe have been searched fr 'in vain;

ants of singular forms, are now known to be possed by peo- '---'
pie no wife different from the other Americans '.

THOUGH those relations may, without discussion, be rejected

as fabulous, there are other accounts of such varieties in the
human species in some parts of the New World, which reft
upon better evidence, and merit more attentive examination.
This variety has been particularly observed in three different
diftrids. The first of these is situated in the isthmus of Da-
rien, near the centre of America. Lionel Wafer, a traveller
pofieffed of more curiosity and intelligence than we flould have
expected to find in an associate of Buccaneers, difcovcred there
a small, but singular race of men. They are of low flature,
according to his description, of a feeble make, incapable of en-
during fatigue. Their colour is a dead milk white; not refem-
bling that of fair people among Europeans, but without any
tintlure of a blulh or sanguine complexion. Their skin is
covered with a fine hairy down of a chalky white, the hair of
their heads, their eye-brows, and eye-lafhcs, are of the fame
hue. Their eyes are of a singular form, and o weak, that
they can hardly bear the light of the fun ; but they fce clearly
by moon-light, and are mofl aive and gay in the night".
No race similar to this has been cdicovered in any other part of
America. Cortes, indeed, found loine perions exactly refem-
bling the white people of Darien, among the rare and mon-
Itrous animals which Montezuma had collectled . But as tlie
power of the Mexican empire cxtended to the provinces border-
ing on the ithmus of Darien, they were probablly brought

A _-~- be, they cannot be confidered as constituting a diftind species.

Among the negroes of Africa, as well as the natives of the Indian
islands, nature sometimes produces a small number of individuals,
with all the charaderiftic features and qualities of the white peo-
ple of Darien. The former are called Albinos by the Portuguese,
the latter Kackerlakes by the Dutch. In Darien the parents of
those Whites are of the fame colour with the other natives of the
country; and this observation applies equally to the anomalous
progeny of the negroes and Indians. The fame mother who
produces some children of a colour that does not belong to the
race, brings forth the reft of the complexion peculiar to her
country . One conclusion may then be formed with refpec
to the people described by Wafer, the Albinos and the Kacker-
lakes; they are a degenerated breed, not a separate class of men;
and from some disease or defect of their parents, the peculiar
colour and debility which mark their degradation is transmitted
to them. As a decisive proof of this, it has been observed, that
neither the white people of Darien, nor the Albinos of Africa,
propagate their race: their children are of the colour and tem-
perament peculiar to the natives of their refpeCive countries .

TH E fccond diflrici that is occupied by inhabitants differing

in appearance from the other people of America, is situated in
a high northern latitude, extending from the coast of Labrador
towards the pole, as far as the country is habitable. The peo.
plc scattercd over those dreary regions, are known to the Euro-
peans by the name of EfJuimaux. They themselves, with that

They are of a middle size and robust, with heads of a difpro- -.-..
portioned bulk, and feet as remarkably fSall. Their com-
plexion, though swarthy, by being continually exposed to the
rigour of a cold climate, inclines to the European white, ra-
ther than to the copper colour of America, and the men have
beards which are sometimes bushy and long'. From there
marks of diffinfion, as well as from one fill less equivocal,
the affinity of their language to that of the Greenlanders, which
I have already mentioned, we may conclude, with onme degree
of confidence, that the Efquimaux are a race different from the
reft of the Americans.

WE cannot decide with equal certainty concerning the

inhabitants of the third diftric, situated at the southern ex-
tremity of America. These are the famous Patagonians, who,
during two centuries and a half, have afforded a subjet
of controversy to the learned, and an ol)jct of wonder to
the vulgar. They are supposed to be one of the wanderilg
tribes, which occupy that vast, but least known region of Ame-
rica, which extends from the river De la Plata to the Straits
of Magellan. Their proper flation is in that part of the in-
terior country, which lies on the banks of the river Negro;
but in the hunting season they often roam as far as the firaits
which separate Tierra del Fuego from the mainland. The first
accounts of this people were brought to Europe by the compa-
nions of Magellan', who described them as a gigantic race,
above eight feet high, and of flrength in proportion to their

of horses and dogs exceed the more diminutive races in stature
and flrength, as far as the Patagonian is supposed to rife above
the usual flandard of the human body. Butanimals attain the
highest perfection of their species, only in mild climates, or
where they find the most nutritive food in greatest abundance.
It is not then in the uncultivated waste of the Magellanic re-
gions, and among a tribe of improvident savages, that we
should expect to find man, possessing the highef 'honours of his
race, and distinguished by a superiority of size and vigour, far
beyond what he has reached in any other part of the earth.
The most explicit and unexceptionable evidence is requisite,
in order to establish a fad, repugnant to those general.principles
and lavs, which seem to affeCt the human frame in every
other initance, and to decide with refpec to its nature and qua-
lities.' Such evidence has not hitherto been produced. Though
several persons, to whose tefimony great refpea is due, have
visited this part of America since the time of Magellan, and
have had interviews with the natives; though ome have as-
firmed, that such as they saw were of gigantic fiature, and
others have formed the fame conclusion from measuring their
footsteps, or the keletons of their dead; yet their accounts
vary from each other in so many essential points, and are min-
gled with so many circumstances manifestly false or fabulous,
as detract much from their credit. On the other hand, rome
navigators, and thofl among the most eminent of their order
for discernment and accuracy, have asserted that the natives of
Patagonia, with whom they had intercourse, though tfout

*diftinguiflfed from the reft of the human species. The exist-
ence of this gigantic race of men seems, then, to be one of
'hose points in natural history, with respect to which a cautious
'inquirer will hesitate, and will chufe to suspend his assent until
more complete evidence hall decide, whether 'he ought to ad-
mit a fat, seemingly inconsistent with what reason and expe-
rience have discovered concerning the firulure and condition
of man, in all the various situations in which he has been ob-
served.

IN order to form a complete idea with refpea to the confli- Theirhftatcof

health.

tution of the inhabitants of this and the other hemisphere, we
'ihould attend not only to the make and vigour of their bodies,
but confider what degree of health they enjoy, and to what period
of longevity they usually arrive. In the simplicity of the savage
state, when man is not oppressed with labour, or enervated by
-luxury, or difquieted.with care, we are apt to imagine that his
life will flow on almost untroubled by disease or suffering, until
his days be terminated, in extreme old age, by the gradual de-
cays of nature. We find, accordingly, among the Americans,
as well as among other rude people, persons, whose decrepit
and hrivelled form seems to indicate an extraordinary length of
life. But as molt of them are unacquainted with the art of
numbering, and all of them as forgetful of what is past, as
they are improvident for what is to come, it is impossible to
.ascertain their age, with any degree of precision'. It is evident,
that the period of their longevity must vary considerably, ac-
cording to the diversity of climates, and their different modes of

B o0 K subsistence. They seem, however, to be every where exempt
u -.--.. from many of the distempers which affli polished nations. None

of the maladies, which are the immediate offspring of luxury,
or sloth, ever visited them; and they have no names in their
languages by which to diftinguilh this numerous train of adven-
titious evils.
DifeaBes. BUT, whatever be the situation in which man is placed, he

is born to susser; and his diseases, in the savage slate, though
fewer in number, are, like those of the animals whom he
nearly resembles in his mode of life, more violent, and more
fatal. If luxury engenders and nourishes difiempers of one
species, the rigour and distresses of savage life bring on
those of another. As men, in this state, are wonderfully
improvident, and their means of subsistence precarious, they
often pass from extreme want to exuberant plenty, according
to the vicissitudes of fortune in the chace, or to the variety in
the producions of the seasons. Their inconsiderate gluttony
in the one situation, and their revere abflinence in the other,
are equally pernicious. For, though the human constitution
may be accustomed by habit, like that of animals of prey, to
tolerate long famine, and then to gorge voracioufy, it is not
a little affeced by such sudden and violent transitions. The
firength and vigour of savages are, at ome seasons, impaired
by what they susser from scarcity of food; at others, they are
afflided with disorders arising from indigefion and a superfluity
of gross aliment. These last are so common, that they may
be confidered as the unavoidable consequence of their mode
of fibfifting, and cut off considerable numbers in the prime
of life. They are likewise extremely subjed to consumptions,

the immoderate hardihips and fatigue which they endure in --
hunting and in war; or owing to the inclemency of the ea-
sons to which they are continually exposed. In the tavage
state, hardlhips and fatigue violently assault the conflitution.
In polished societies, intemperance undermines it. It is not
easy to determine which of them operates with most fatal
effet, or tends most to abridge human life. The influence of
the former is certainly most extensive. The pernicious con-
sequences of luxury reach only a few members in any commu-
nity, the diltreffes of savage life are felt by all. As far as I can
judge, after very minute inquiry, the general period of human
life is shorter among savages, than in well-regulated and indus-
trious societies.

ONE dreadfiulmalady, the severest scourge, with which, in this

life, offended Heaven chastens the indulgence of criminal desire,
seems to have been peculiar to the Americans. By communi-
cating it to their conquerors, they have not only amply
avenged their own wrongs, but by adding this calamity to
those which formerly embittered human life, they have, per-
haps, more than counterbalanced all the benefits which Europe
has derived from the discovery of the New World. This dif-
temper, from the country in which it first raged, or from the
people by whom it was supposed to have been fprcad over
Europe, has been sometimes called the Ncapolitan, and some-
times the French diecace. At its firIt appearance, the infection

Aftoniihment and terror accompanied this unknown affliaion,
in its progress, and men began to dread the extinction of the
human race by such a cruel visitation. Experience, and the
ingenuity of physicians, gradually discovered remedies of such
virtue as to cure or mitigate the evil. During the course of
two centuries and a half, its virulence seems to have abated con-
fiderably. At length, in the fame manner with the leprosy,
which raged in Europe for some centuries, it may wafle its force
and disappear; and in some happier age, this western infection,
like that from the Eafl, may be known only by defcrip-
tion c.

Power and II. AFTER confidering what appears to be peculiar in the
qaities f. bodily constitution of the Americans, our attention is naturally

turned towards the powers and qualities of their minds. As
the individual advances from the ignorance and imbecillity of
the infant state, to vigour and maturity of underflanding, some-
thing similar to this may be observed in the progress of the fpe-
cies. With refped to it, too, there is a period of infancy, dur-
ing which several powers of the mind are not unfolded, and all
are feeble and defective in their operation. In the early ages
of society, while the condition of man is simple and rude, his
reason is but little exercised, and his desires move within a
very narrow :phere,. Hence arise two remarkable characteristics
of the human mind, in this slate. Its intellectual powers are
extremely limited ; its emotions and efforts are few and lan-

society, and never becomes the occupation or amufemcnt of
the human faculties, until man be so far improved as to have
secured, with certainty, the means of fubfiflence, as well as the
possession of leisure and tranquillity. The thoughts and atten-
tion of a savage are confined within the small circle of objeds,.
immediately conducive to his preservation or enjoyment. Every
thing beyond that, escapes his observation, or is perfectly in-
different to him. Like a mere animal, what is before his eyes
interests and affects him; what is out of fight, or at a diflance,
makes no impression'. There are several people in America
whose limited understandings seem not to be capable of form-
ing an arrangement for futurity; neither their solicitude nor
their foresight extend so far. They follow blindly the im-
pulse of the appetite which they feel, but are entirely regardless
of distant consequences, and even of those removed in the lcafl
degree from immediate apprehension. While they highly
prize such things as serve present use, or minister to prcfent en-
joyment, they set no value upon those which are not the object
of some immediate want'. When, on the approach of the
evening, a Caribbee feels himself disposed to go to reft, no con-
fideration will tempt him to fell his hammoc. But, in the
morning, when he is sallying out to the business or pafliine of

-~-« his fancy'. At the close of winter, while the impreflion of

what he has suffered from the rigour of the climate is fresh in
the mind of the North American, he sets himself with vigour
to prepare materials for ereing a comfortable hut to protect
him against the inclemency of the fuccceding fealon; but as
soon as the weather becomes mild, he forgets what is paft,.aban-
dons his work, and never thinks of it more, until the return of
cold compels him, when too late, to resume it .

IF in concerns the most interesting, and seemingly the moit

Iimple, the reason of man, while rude and destitute of culture,
differs so little from the thoughtless levity of children, or the
improvident inftind of animals, its exertions in other direc-
tions cannot be very considerable. The objecs towards which
reaftn turns, and the disquisitions in which it engages, must
depend upon the state in which man is placed, and are fug-
gested by his necessities and desires. Disquisitions, which ap-
pear the most necefary and important to men in one slate of
society, never occur to those in another. Among civilized na-
tions, arithmetic, or the art of numbering, is deemed an effen-
tial and elementary science, and in our continent, the invention
and use of it reaches back to a period so remote as is beyond
the knowledge of history. But among savages, who have no
property to climatc, no hoarded treasures to count, no variety
of oljecs or multiplicity of ideas to enumerate, arithmetic is
a fupcrflnous and uclefs art. Accordingly, among tome tribes
in Amcrica it fccns to be quite unknown. Ticre are many

ceed as far as ten, others to twenty. When they would convey
an idea of any number beyond there, they point to the hair of
their head, intimating that it is equal to them, or with wonder
declare it to be so great that it cannot be reckoned '. Not only
the Americans, but all nations, while extremely rude, seem to
be unacquainted with the art of computation . As soon, how-
ever, as they acquire such acquaintance or connection with a
variety of objects, that there is frequent occasion to combine or
divide them, their knowledge of numbers incrcafes, so that the
itate of this art among any people may be confidercd as one
standard, by which to ellimate the degree of their improve-
ment. The Iroquois, in North America, as they are much
more civilized than the rude inhabitants of Brasil, Paraguay,
or Guiana, have likewile made greater advances in this respect;
though even their arithmetic does not extend beyond a thou-
sand, as in their ptty tranfacions they have no occasion for
any higher number. The Cherokee, a less considerable
nation on the fame continent, can reckon only as fr as a
hundred, and to tlat extent have names for the several num-
bers; the finaller tribes in their neighbourhood can rife no
higher than ten .

Satisfied with confidering them under that simple mode, in
which they appear to him, as separate and detached, he neither
combines them so as to form general classes, nor contemplates

beflows a thought upon the operations of his own mind con-

*which have been denominated universal, or abJiraac, or of reflec-

confired, and his reasoning powers be employed merely on what
is sensible. This is so remarkably the cafe with the ruder na-
tions of America, that their languages (as we shall afterwards
find) have not a word to express any thing but what is material

of South-America, the inhabitants of ome of the islands, and
of several fertile plains on the continent, come under this de-
scription. Their vacant countenance, their flaring unexpressive
eye, their lifeless inattention, and total ignorance of subjes,
which seem to be the first which hould occupy the thoughts of
rational beings, made such impression upon the Spaniards, when
they firit beheld those rude people, that they confidered them as
animals of an inferior order, and could not believe that they be-
longed to the human species d. It required the authority of a
papal bull to counterat this opinion, and to convince them that
the Americans were capable of the funcions, and intitled to
the privileges, of humanity'. Since that time, persons more
enlightened and impartial than the discoverers or conquerors of
America, have had an opportunity of contemplating the moll
savage of its inhabitants, and they have been astonished and
humbled, with observing how nearly man, in this condition,
approaches. to the brute creation. But in feverer climates,
where fubfiflence cannot be procured with the fame ease, where
men mulf unite more closely, and a with greater concert,
neceflity calls forth their talents, and harpens their invention,
so that the intelligent powers are more exercised and im-
proved. The North-Americans and natives of Chili, who in-
habit the temperate regions in the two great diftricds of Ame-
rica, are people of cultivated and enlarged underflandings, when
viewed in comparison with some of those feated in the islands, or
on the banks of the Maragnon and Orinoco. Their occupations

and Chilefc, when not engaged in ome of the functions be-
longing to a warrior or hunter, loiter away their time in
thoughtless indolence, unacquainted with any other f:bjet
worthy of their attention, or capable of occupying their minds '.
If even among them, reason is so much circumscribed in its ex-
ertions, and never arrives, in its highest attainments, at the
knowledge of those general principles and maximsj which
serve as the foundation of science, we may conclude, that the
intellectual powers of man in the savage slate are destitute of
their proper object, and cannot acquire any considerable degree
of vigour and enlargement.

acquired wants and appetites. These are numerous and imr

but as they devour, with little diftindion, whatever will ap-
pease its inflinaive demands, the exertions which thcie occa-

dition, urge him to fulfil his destiny. Accordingly, among
most of the American nations, especially those feated in rigorous
climates, some efforts are employed, and ofme previous precau-
tions are taken, for securing subsistence. The career of re-
gular indutry is begun, and the laborious arm has made the
first essays of its power. Still, however, the improvident
and slothful genius of the savage fate predominates. Even
among those more improved tribes, labour is deemed ig-
nominious and degrading. It is only to work of a certain
kind that a man will deign to put his hand. The greater part
is devolved entirely upon the women. One half of the com-
munity remains inadtive, while the other is oppressed with the
multitude and variety of its. occupations. Thus their induflry
is partial, and the foresight which regulates it, is no less limited.
A remarkable instance of this occurs in the chief arrangement
with refpet to their manner of living. They depend for their
subsistence, during one part of the year, on fishing; during
another, on hunting; during a third, on the produce of their
agriculture. Though experience has taught them to foresee the
return of those various seasons, and to make some provision for
the respective exigencies of each, they either want sagacity to
proportion this provision to their consumption, or are so incapa-
ble of any command over their appetites, that, from their incon-
fiderate waste, they often feel the calamities of famine as fe-
verely as the rudest of the avage tribes. What they susser one
year does not augment their indufiry, or render them more
provident to prevent similar distresses . This inconsiderate
thoughtlessness about futurity, the effed of ignorance and the

cans, and contemplating the powers of their minds, we are led, 'iate.
in the natural order of inquiry, to confider them as united to-
gether i society. Hitherto our researches have been confined
to the operations of underfanding refpeding themselves, as in-
dividu:als, now they will extend to the degree of their sensibility
and affection towards their species.

THE domestic slate is the first and most simple form of hu- Domeflic

man association. The union of the sexes, among different union.
animals, is of longer or horter duration in proportion to the
ease or difficulty of rearing their offspring. Among thofc
tribes where the season of infancy is hort, and the young soon
acquire vigour or agility, no permanent union is formed.
Nature commits the care of training up the offspring to the
mother alone, and her tenderness, without any other assistance,
is equal to the tafl. But where the ate of infancy is long and
helpless, and the joint assiduity of both parents is requisite in
tending their feeble progeny, there a more intimate connecion
takes place, and continues until the purpose of nature be ac-
complithed, and the new race grow up to full maturity. As
the infancy of man is more feeble and helpless than that of any
other animal, and he is dependent, during a much longer pe-
riod, on the care and foresight of his parents, the union betwecn.

husband2

B o o x husband ad wife came early to be confidered, not only as a
-.-' foleman, but as a permanent contract. A general frate of pro-

mifcuous intercourse between the sexes never existed but in the
imagination of poets. In the infancy of society, when men,
deflitute of arts and industry, lead a hard precarious life, the
rearing of their progeny demands the attention and efforts of
both parents; and if their union had not been formed and con-
tinued with this view, the race could not have been preserved.
Accordingly, in America, even among the rudelt tribes, a re-
gular union between husband and wife was universal, and the
r-ghts of marriage were underflood and recognized. In those
.diltrits where fubfifence was scanty, and the difficulty of main-
taining a family was great, the man confined himfelfto one wife.
In warmer and more fertile provinces, the facility of procuring
food concurred with the influence of climate, in inducing the
inhabitants to increase the number of their wives . In some
countries the marriage union subsisted during life; in others,
the impatience of the Americans under restraint of any species,
together with their natural levity and caprice, prompted them
to (diflolve it on very flight pretexts, and often without assigning
any caluf ".

Condlion of Bur in whatever light the Americans confidered the'obliga-
AvOnóIc. tion of this contrac either as perpetual, or only as temporary,

the condition of women was equally humiliating and miserable.
Whether man has been improved by the progress of arts and
civilisation in society, is a qucflion, which, in the wantonness of
dliifutation, ha-s been agitated among philosophers. That women

are indebted to the refinements of poliled manners for a happy BO o K
change in their fate, is a point whichcan admit of no doubt. To --
despise and to degrade tlh female sex, is the characeriftic of the
savage state in every part of the globe. Man, proud of excelling in
firength and in courage, the chief marks of pre-eminence among
rude people, treats woman, as an inferior, with difilain. The
Americans, perhaps from tlat coldness and infcnlihility which
has been confidered as peculiar to their conrflitution, al ncglct
and harshness to contempt. The molt intclligent travi!Ic:s
have been struck with this inattention of the Amecricans to tcir
women. It is not, as I have already ol)bcrvccl, by a ftudicl dlf-
play of tenderness and attachment, that the American cndca-
vours to gain the heart of the woman whom lie twihes to marry.
Marriage itself, inflead of being an union of affTccion and in-
terests between equals, becomes, among them, the unnatural
conjuntion of a master with his slave. It is the olbfevation of
an author, whose opinions are defervcdly of great weight,
that wherever wives are purchased, their condition is extremely
depressed . They become the property and the slaves of tholc
who buy them. In whatever part of the globe this culloin
prevails, tle observation holds. In countries wlcre rclincment
has made ome progress, women when purchascd arc excludcd
from society, hut up in fcqueftered apartments, and kept undcr
the vigilant guard of their maflers. In ruder nations, they are
degraded to the meanest funCtions. Among many people of
America the marriage-contract is properly a purchalb. Theli
man buys his wife of her parents. Though un:lc(]aintcd wibt

them occasionally, or assists in cultivating their fields, and form-

as are deemed most valuable on account of their usefulness or
rarity . In return for there, he receives his wife; and this
circumstance, added to the low estimation of women among
savages, leads him to confider her as a female servant whom he
has acquired, and whom he has a title to treat as an inferior.
In all unpolilhed nations, it is true, the funEtions in domestic
ceconomy, which fall naturally to the hare of women, are so
many, that they are fubjeded to hard labour, and mult bear
more than their full portion of the common burden. But
in America their condition is so peculiarly grievous, and their
depression so complete, that servitude is a name too mild to de-
scribe their wretched slate. A wife, among most tribes, is no
better than a beast of burden, destined to every office of labour
and fatigue. While the men loiter out the day in sloth, or
spend it in amusement, the women are condemned to incessant
toil. Talks are imposed upon them without pity, and services
are received without complacence or gratitude P. Every cir-
cumftance reminds women of this mortifying inferiority. They
mull approach their lords with everence; they must regard
them as more exalted beings, and are not permitted to eat in
their presence . There are difirids in America where this do-
minion is so grievous, and so sensibly felt, that some women,
in a wild emotion of maternal tenderness, have deltroyed their

lific '. The vigour of their conflitution is cxhaufled by cxccf-
five fattigue, and the wants and diftrefics of savaeg life are o
numerous, as to force them to take various precautions in order
to prevent too rapid an increase of their progeny. Among
wandering tribes, or such as depend chiefly upon hunting for
fubfitfence, the mother cannot attempt to rear a second child,
until the first has attained such a degree of vigour as to be in
some measure independent of her care. From this motive, it
is the universal practice of the American womnc to suckle their
children during several years '; and as they flcdom marry
early, the period of their fertility is over, before they can inilh
the long but ncccflary attcndance upon two or three filccelive
children ". Among lbme of the lecaf polifllcd tribes, whose indulry

are born, one of them commonly is abandoned, because the mo-
ther is not equal to the task of educating both '. When a mo-
ther dies while file is nursing a child, all hope of preserving its
life fails, and it is buried together with her in the fame grave ".
As the parents are frequently exposed to want by their own im-
provident indolence, the difficulty of fuflaining their children
becomes so great, that it is not uncommon to abandon or destroy
them b. Thus their experience of the difficulty of training up
an infant to maturity, amidst the hardships of savage life, often
flifes the voice of nature among the Americans, and fuppreifes
the firong emotions of parental tenderness.

not deficient in affetion and attachment to their offspring.
They feel the power of this inftind in its full force, and as
long as their progeny continue feeble and helpless, no people
exceed them in tenderness and care '. But in rude nations,
the dependence of children upon their parents is of shorter
continuance than in polifled societies. When men must be
trained to the various funCtions of civil life by previous dif-

years of infancy, but extend to what is more remote, the efta-
blifhment of his child in the world. Even then, his olicitude
does not terminate. His protection may ill be requisite, and
his wisdom and experience still prove useful guides. Thus a per-
manent connection is formed; parental tenderness is exercised,
and filial respect returned, throughout the whole course of life.
But in the simplicity of the savage state, the affection of parents,
like the inflintive fondness of animals, ceases almost entirely as
soon as their offspring attain maturity. Little inflruaion fits
them for that mode of life to which they are destined. The pa-
rents, as if their duty were accomplished, when they have con-
duCted their children through the helpless years of infancy, leave
them afterwards at entire liberty. They seldom advise or ad-
monifhl, they never chide or chastise them. They susser them
to be absolute masters of their own ations b. In an American
hut, a father, a mother, and their posterity, live together
like persons assembled by accident, without fceming to feel
the obligation of the duties mutually arising from this con-
necion . As filial love is not cherilhed by the continuance
of attention or good offices, the recollection of benefits received
in early infancy is too faint to excite it. Conscious of tllcir own
liberty, and impatient of rcflraint, the youth of America arc

operations of men when united together in society, the firfl.
objec of attention should be their mode of subsistence. Ac-

flates in which he has been ever observed, or, perhaps, can

ture for subsistence. They discover no iblicitudle, they employ
little foresight, they fcarccly exert any indufiry, to secure
what is necessary for their l`pport. Tile boparers of IBrafi,
the Guaxeros of Tierra-Firme, the C.',,:tll7, thle loxos, and
several other people of Paraguay, are unacquainted with every
species of cultivation. They neither fixv nor plant. Even the
culture of the manioc, of which cafllda bread is made, i a.
art too intricate for their ingenuity, or too fatiguing to their
indolence. The roots which the earth produces ipontaneoully,
the fruits, the berries, and the feeds, which they gather in the
woods, together with lizards and other reptiles, whlich multiply
amazingly with the heat of the climate in a fat foil, moiflcned by
frequent rains, supply them with food during omei part of the

with which she ministers, in this way, to their wants. The vast

annual overflowing of the waters, arc fl illd with all the different

America induces many of the natives to resort to their banks,
and to depend almost entirely for nourishment on what their
waters supply with such profusion '. In this part of the
globe, hunting seems not to have been the firit employment of
men, or the first effort of their invention and labour to obtain
food. They were fishers before they became hunters; and as
the occupations of the former do not call for equal exertions
of acivity, or talents, with those of the latter, people in that
state appear to poflefs neither the fame degree of enterprise,
nor of ingenuity. The petty nations, adjacent to the Marag-

selves in this manner. The greater part of the American na-

it from their earliest youth. A bold and dextrous hunter ranked
next in fame to the distinguished warrior, and an alliance with
the former is often courted in preference to one with the latter'.
Hardly any device, which the igenuity of man has discover-
ed for ensnaring or deltroying wild animals, was unknown to
the Americans. While engaged in this favourite exercise, they
shake off the indolence peculiar to their nature, their latent powers
and vigour of their minds are rouled, and they become ativc,
persevering, and indefatigable. Their sagacity in finding their
prey, and their address in killing it, are equal. Their reason
and their senses, being constantly direted towards this one ob-
ject, the former displays such fertility of invention, and the
latter acquire such a degree of acuteness, as appear almolt in-
credible. They discern the footsteps of a wild beafl, which
escape every other eye, and can follow them with certainty
through the pathless forest. If they attack their game openly,
their arrow eldom errs from the mark "'; if they endeavour to
circumvent it by art, it is almost impossible to avoid their toils.
Among several tribes, tlieir young men were not permittcd to
marry, until they had given such proofs of their fill in hunting

at by cultivation, is to supply any occasional defect of these. In
the southern continent of America, the natives confined their
industry to rearing a few plants, which, in a rich foil and warm
climate, were easily trained to maturity. The chief of these is
Mlaize, well known in Europe by the name of Turkey or Indian
wheat, a grain extremely prolific, of simple culture, agreeable
to the taste, and affording a firong hearty nourishment. The
second is the Manioc, which grows to the size of a large flrub,
or frall tree, and produces roots somewhat resembling parflips.
After carefully squeezing out the juice, these roots are grated
down to a fine powder, and formed into thin cakes, called
Canada bread, which, though insipid to the taste, proves no
contemptible food P. As the juice of the manioc is a dead-
ly poison, some authors have celebrated the ingenuity of the
Americans, in converting a noxious plant into wholesome
nourifhlment. But it should rather be conlidered as one
of the desperate expedients for procuring fubfiflcnce, to
which neceflity reduces rude nations; or, perhaps, men were
led to the use of it by a progress, in which there is nothing
marvellous. One species of manioc is altogether free of any
poisonous quality, and may be eaten without any preparation
but that of roafling it in the embers. This, it is probable, was

from the other species, they have by experience found it to be
the nofl prolific as well as the most nourifiing plant of the
two . The third is the plantain, which though it rites to the
height of a tree, is of such quick growth, that in lets than a
year it rewards the industry of the cultivator with its fruit.
This, when roasted, supplies the place of bread, and is both pa-
latable and nourifhingr. The fourth is the potatoe, whose cul-
ture and qualities are too well known to need any description.
The fifth is pimento, a small tree, yielding a firong aromatic
spice. The Americans, who, like other inhabitants of warm
climates, delight in whatever is hot and of poignant flavour,
deem this seasoning a necessary of life, and mingle it copiously
with every kind of food they take '.

SUCH are the various productions, which were the chief ob-

jed of culture among the hunting tribes on the continent of
America, and with a moderate exertion of active and provident
industry, there might have yielded a full supply to the wants
of a numerous people. But men, accustomed to the free and
vagrant life of hunters, are incapable of regular application to
labour; and confider agriculture as a secondary and inferior
occupation. Accordingly, the provision for subsistence, arising
from cultivation, was so limited and scanty among the Ameri-
cans, that, upon any accidental failure of their usual success in.
hunting, they were often reduced to extreme distress.

ferent. None of the large animals which abound on the con- --
tinent were known there. Only four species of quadrupeds,
betides a kind of small dumb dog, existed in the islands, the
biggest of which did not exceed the size of a rabbit ". To hunt
such diminutive prey, was an occupation which required no
effort either of acivity or courage. The chief employment of
a hunter in the isles was to kill birds, which on the continent
are deemed ignoble game, and left chiefly to the pursuit of boys .
This want of animals, as well as their peculiar situation, led
the islanders to depend principally upon fifaing for their sub-
filtence . Their rivers, and the ea with which they are fur-
rounded, supplied them with this species of food. At some
particular seasons, turtle, crabs, and other fhell-fifl, abounded
in such numbers, that they could support themselves with a fa-
cility in which their indolence delighted . At other times, they
ate lizards, and various reptiles of odious forms . To fifling,
the inhabitants of the islands added some degree of agriculture.
Maize b, manioc, and other plants, were cultivated in the fame
manner as on the continent. But all the fruits of their industry, Their agri-
together with what their foil and climate produced fponta- culictiei.
neoufly, afforded them but a scanty maintenance. Though
their demands for food were very sparing, they hardly railed
what was sufficient for their own consumption. If a few Spa-
niards fettled in any diftrit, such a finall addition of fipcrnu-
inerary mouths oon xhauflcd their scanty fIorcs, and brought
on a famine.

metals.

The want of IN other parts of the globe, man, in his rudest slate, appears
tameanmals. as lord of the creation, giving law to various tribes of animals,

which he has tamed and reduced to fubjeaion. The Tartar
follows his prey on the horse which he has reared ; or tends his
numerous herds, which furnish him both with food and clothing;
the Arab has rendered the camel docile, and avails himself of
its persevering strength; the Laplander has formed the rein-
deer to be subservient to his will; and even the people of Kam-
chatka have trained their dogs to labour. This command over
the inferior creatures is one of the noblest prerogatives of man,
and among the greatest efforts of his wisdom and power.
Without this, his dominion is incomplete. He is a monarch,
who has no fubjeds; a mailer, without servants, and must
perform every operation by the strength of his own arm. Such
was the condition of all the rude nations in America. Their
reason was so little improved, or their union so incomplete,
that they seem not to have been conscious of the superiority of
their nature, and suffered all the animal creation to retain its
liberty, without eftablifling their own authority over anyone fpe-
cies. Most of the animals, indeed, which have been rendered
domeflic in our continent, do not exist in the New World; but
those peculiar to it are neither so fierce, nor so formidable, as to
have exempted them fiom servitude. There are fomne animals
of the fame fpecics in both continents. But the rein-deer, which

hlas

has been tamed and broken to the yoke in the one hemisphere, B K
runs wild in the other. The bon of America is manifefily of the I-,-
fame species with the horned cattle of the other hemisphere .
These, even among the rudest nations in our continent, have
been rendered domestic; and in consequence of his dominion
over them, man can accomplish works of labour with greater
facility, and has made a vast addition co his means of subsist-
ence. The inhabitants of many regions in the New World,
where the bison abounds, might have derived the fame advan-
tages from it. It is not of a nature so indocile, but that it might
have been trained to be as subservient to man as our cattle d.
But a savage, in that uncultivated state wherein the Americans
were discovered, is the enemy of the other animals, not their
superior. He wafles and defiroys, but knows not how to mul-
tiply or to govern them '.

THIS, perhaps, is the most notable diftin&ion between the

inhabitants of the Ancient and New Worlds, and a high pre-
eminence of civilized men above such as continue rude. The'
greatest operations of man in changing and improving the face
of nature, as well as his molt considerable efforts in cultivating
the earth, are accomplifled by means of the aid which.he receives
from the animals whom he has tamed and employs in labour.
It is by their flrength that he subdues the flubborn foil, and
converts the desert or marih into a fruitful field. But man, in
his civilized state, is so accultomed to the service of the domestic
animals, that he seldom rcflccs upon the vast benefits which
he derives from it. If we were to filppofe hint even when

W.'nt of the IT is a doubtful point, whether the dominion of man

over the animal creation, or his acquiring the ule of metals,
has contributed molt to extend his power. The ara of this
important discovery is unknown, and in our hemifplere very
remote. It is only by tradition, or by digging up Come rude
intlrunients of our fbrefathers, that we learn that mankind
were originally unacquainted with the use of metals, and en-
deavoured to supply the want of them by employing flints,
ihells,, boncs., and other hard substances, for the fame purposes
which metals serve among polished nations. Nature completes
the formation of some metals. Gold, silver, and copper, are
found in their perfectQ fate, in the clefts of rocks, in the ides
of mountains, or the channels of rivers. These were accord-
ingly the metals firlt known, and firit applied to use. But
iron, the molt serviceable of all, and to which man is most in-
debted, is never discovered in its perfec form; its gross and flub-
born ore muff feel twice the force of fire, and go through two
laborious proceflis, before it become fit for use. Man was long
acquainted with the other metals, before he acquired the art of
fabricating iron, or attained such ingenuity as to perfect an in-
vention, to which he was indebted for those inflruncnts where-
with lie subdues the earth, and commands all its inhabitants.
But in this, as well as in many other respects, the inferiority
of the Americans was confpictlous. All the lavage tribes, scat-
tcrcd over the continent and islands, were totally un;acqainlted

with the metals which their foil produces in great abundance, if B O o K

we except ome trifling quantity of gold, which they picked up
in the torrents that descended from their mountains, and
formed into ornaments. Their devices to supply this want of
the serviceable metals, were extremely rude and awkward.
The most simple operation was to them an undertaking of
immense difficulty and labour. To fell a tree with no other
iniruments than hatchets of flone, was employment for a
month '. To form a canoe into fllape, and to hollow it, con-
filmed years; and it frequently began to rot before they were
able to finifih it . Their operations in agriculture were equally
flow and defective. In a country covered with woods of the
hardest timber, the clearing of a small field deflined for cul-
ture required the united efforts of a tribe, and was a work of
much time and great toil. This was the butinefs of the men,
and their indolence was satisfied with performing it in a very
slovenly manner. The labour of cultivation was left to the
women, who, after digging, or rather flirring the field, with
wooden mattocks, and flakes hardened in the fire, sowed or
planted it; but were more indebted for the increafc to the ser-
tility of the foil, than to their own rude induRtry h

AGRICULTURE, even when the frength of man is seconded

by that of the animals which he has fubjccted to the yoke, and
his power augmented by the use of the various infiruncnts with
which the discovery of metals has furnilfced him, is Ilill a work
of great labour; and it is with the fvcat of Ihis brow that lie
renders the earth fertile. It is not wonderful, then, that people

Political in- FROM this description of the mode of fubfflsing among the
Ilitutions a-
rising from rude American tribes, the form and genius of their political

circumstances of diftinion between them and more civilized
nations.

i. Divided I. THEY were divided into small independent communities.
into small
communities. While hunting is the chief source of subsistence, a vait extent

of territory is requisite for supporting a small number of people.
In poportion as men multiply and unite, the wild animals,
on which they prey, diminish, or fly at a greater distance from
the haunts of their enemy. The increase of a society in this
state is limited by its own nature, and the members of it must
either disperse, like the game which they pursue, or fall upon
some better method of procuring food, than by hunting.
Beasts of prey are by nature solitary and unsocial, they go not
forth to the chafe in herds, but delight in those recesses of the
forcf where they can roam and destroy undisturbed. A nation
of hunters resembles them both in occupation and in genius.
They cannot form into large communities, because it would
be impoflible to find fubfiftencc, and they must drive to a
distance every rival who may encroach on those domains, which
they conrider as their own. This was the state of all the Ame-
rican tribes, the numbers in each were small, though scattered
over vast countries; they were far removed from one another,

anll

and engaged in perpetual hostilities or rivalfhip . In America, B O rK
the word nation is not of the fame import as in other parts of
the globe. It is applied to small societies, not exceeding, per-
haps, two or three hundred persons, but occupying provinces
larger than ome kingdoms in Europe. The country of
Guiana, though of larger extent than the kingdom of France,
and divided among a great number of nations, did not contain
above twenty-five thousand inhabitants k. In the provinces
which border on the Orinoco, one may travel several hundred
miles in different directions, without finding a ingle hut, or
observing the footsteps of a human creature '. In North-Ame-
rica, where the climate is more rigorous, and the foil les' ser-
tile, the desolation is fill greater. There, vast journeys of
some hundred leagues have been made through uninhabited
plains and forests ". As long as hunting continues to be the
chief employment of man to which he trusts for fubfiflence, he
can hardly be said to have occupied the earth ".

of small value, or of cafy acquisition. Where it is so rare, that
the labour or danger of the chafe requires the united eflorts

rence to his fellow-citizens. They belong alike to all; and
thither, as to a general and undivided store, all repair in quelt

their chief occupation, extend to that which is subordinate.
Even agriculture has not introduced among them a complete idea
of property. As the men hunt, the women labour together, and

the harvest in common °. Among ome tribes, the increase of

Among others, though they lay up separate flores, they do
not acquire such an exclusive right of property, that they can

there can be no difinition among men, but what arises from c 0 K
personal qualities. These can be conlpicuous only on fuich
occasions as call them forth into exertion. In times of dan-
ger, or in affairs of intricacy, tle wisdom and eNpcricncc us
age are consulted, and prescribe tle mieafiires which ought to
be pursued. When a tribe of savages takes the field againfl the
enemies of their country, the warrior cf most approved courage
leads the youth to the conibat . If they go forth in a body to
the chafe, the most expert and adventurous hunter is foremolt,
and direcs their motions. But during seasons of tranquillity
and inaction, when there is no occasion to dilplay tllofe ta-
lents, all pre-eminence ceases. Every circumflance indicates,
that all the members of the community are on a level. They
are clothed in the fame simple garb. They feed on the fame
plain fare. Their houses and furniture are cxactly similar.
No distinction can arise from the inequality of pofefNions.
Whatever forms dependence on one part, or constitutes fiupe-
riority on the other, is unknown. All are freemen, all feel
themselves to be such, and assert with firmness the rights which
belong to that condition '. This sentiment of independence
is imprinted so deeply in their nature, that no change of con-
dition can eradicate it and bend their minds to servitude.
Accustomed to be absolute matters of their own condu, they
disdain to execute the orders of another, and, having never
known controul, will not submit to correction . Many of the
Americans, when they found that they were treated as saves
by the Spaniards, died of grief; many dcfiroyed themselves in
despair ".

Jipriclt. incompletely conceived ; while the spontaneous produtions of

the earth, as well as the fruits of induflry, are confidered as
belonging to the public flock, there can hardly be any such
subjed of difference or dilcuffion among the members of the
fame community, as will require the hand of authority to in-
terpofe in order to adjust it. Where the right of separate
and exclusive possession is not introduced, the great obje&
of law and jurifdidion does not exist. When called into the
field, either in their own defence, or to invade the territories
of their enemies, when engaged in the toil and dangers of the
chafe, the members of a tribe perceive that they are part of
a political body. They are conscious of their own connection
with the companions in conjuncion with whom they at; and
they follow and reverence such as excel in conduEt and valour.
But, during the intervals between such common efforts, they
Ire scarcely conscious of the ties of political union ". No vi-
fible form of government is established. The names of ma-
gijfrate andfitbje are not in use. Every one seems to enjoy
his natural independence almofi entire. If a scheme of public
utility be proposed, the members of the community are left at
liberty to chufe whether they will assist or not in carrying it
into execution. No fiatute inpofes any service as a duty, no
compulsory laws oblige them to perform it. All their refolu-
tions are voluntary, and flow from the impulse of their own
minds . The first ftep towards cftablifling a public jurifdic-

tion has not been taken in those rude societies. The right of B
revenge is left in private hands : If violence is committed, or a _-
blood is shed, the community does not aume the power either
of inflicting or of moderating the punishment. It belongs to the
family and friends of the person injured or fain to avenge the
wrong, or to accept of the reparation offered by the aggrcff)r.
If the elders interpose, it is to advise, not to decide, and it ia
seldom their counsels are listened to; for as it is deemed pufil-
lanimous to fuflfer an offender to escape with impunity, rcfent-
ment is implacable and everlafing . The objca of govern-
ment among savages is rather foreign than domestic. They do
not aim at maintaining interior order and police by public regu-
lations, or the exertions of any permanent authority, but labour
to preserve such union among the members of their tribe, fllat
they may watch the motions of their enemies, and at againlt
them with concert and vigour.

been observed by persons, capable of discerning the minute and
delicate circumstances, which serve to discriminate nations re-
fembling one another in their general character and features.
The description which I have given will apply, with little vari-
ation, to the policy of every people in America, which has
added ome degree of agriculture to fishing and hunting.

RUDE and imperfect as those inffitutions may appear, fevera

tribes were not so far advanced in their political progress.
Among all those petty nations which trusted for subsistence en-
tirely to fishing and hunting without any species of cultivation,
the union was so incomplete, and their sense of mutual depen-
dence so feeble, that hardly any appearance of government or
order can be discerned in their proceedings. Their wants are
few, their objeds of pursuit simple, they form into separate
tribes, and ad together, from inflind, habit, or conveniency,
rather than from any formal concert and association. To this
class belong the Californians, several of the small nations in the
extensive country of Paraguay, ome of the people on the
banks of the Orinoco, and on the river St. Magdalene, in the
new kingdom of Granada b

among those people of America, whom I have included under
the common denomination of avage. These are lo crlious and
important that I ilall describe them, and attempt to explain
their origin.

IN the New World, as well as in other parts of the globe, 'articuarly

in ome of

cold or temperate countries appear to be the favourite feat of tIhcwrmer
freedom and independence. There the mind, like the body, is regios.0
firm and vigorous. Conscious of their own dignity, and ca-
pable of the greatest efforts in aerting it, men aspire to inde-
pendence, and their Itubborn spirits sloop with relulance to
the yoke of servitude. In warmer climates, by whose influence
the whole frame is so much enervated, that present pleasure is
the supreme felicity, and mere repose is enjoyment, men ac-
quiefce, almost without a struggle, in the dominion of a fipe-
rior. Accordingly, if we proceed from north to $litlh along
the continent of America, we flall find the power of tllole
venied with authority gradually incrcafing, a(nd the spirit of the
people becoming more tame and pallive. In Florida, the au-
thoriry of tile faclems, caziqucs, or cliefs, was not only per-

northern tribes were altogether unacquainted. Some families
were reputed noble, and enjoyed hereditary dignity. The body
of the people was confidered as vile, and formed only for subjec-
tion. This diflindion was marked by appellations which inti-
mated the high elevation of the one state, and the ignominious
depreflon of the other. The former were called ReJipeable;
the latter, the Stinkards. The great Chief, in whom the fu-
preme authority was veiled, is reputed to be a being of superior
nature, the brother of the Sun, the sole objec of their worship.
They approach him with religious veneration, and honour him
as the representative of their deity. His will is a law, to which
all tilbnit with implicit obedience. The lives of his fubjecs are
so absolutely at his disposal, that if any one has incurred his dif-
pleasure, the offender comes with profound humility and offers
him his head. Nor does the dominion of the Chiefs end with.
their lives ; their principal officers, their favouritewives, toge-
ther with many domestics of inferior rank, are sacrificed at their
tombs, that they may be attended in the next world by thefame
pcrlbns who ierved them in this; and such is the reverence in
which they are held, that those viciims welcome death with ex-
ultation, deeming it a recompence of their fidelity and a mark of
diflintion, to be flec'ed to accompany their deceased master d.

caziques or chiefs poffefled extensive power, The dignity was
transmitted by hereditary right from father to son. Its ho-
nours and prerogatives were considerable. Their fubjets paid
great respect to the caziques, and executed their orders without
hcfitation or reserve'. They were distinguished by peculiar
ornaments, and in order to prefervc or augment the veneration
of the people, they had the address to call in the aid of super-

aflimcd a regular form. A jurifdicion was established, which
took cognizance of different crimes, and punilhed them with
rigour. A difnintion of ranks was known; their chief, to
whom the Spaniards gave the title of monarch, and who merited
that name on account of his splendor as well as power, reigned
with absolute authority. He was attended by officers of various
conditions; he never appeared in public without a numerous re-
tinue; lhe was carried ill a fort of palanqiuin with much pomp,
and harbingers went before him to fwep the road and strew it

or taxes received from his fubjccts, to whom their prince was
such an objec of veneration, that none of them presumed to
looklhim directly in the face, or ever approached him but with
an averted countenance . There were other tribes on the fame
continent, among which, though fr less advanced than the
people of Bogota in their progress towards refinement, the free-
dom and independence, natural to man in his savage state, was
much abridged, and their caziques had afiumed extensive au-
thority.

and more difcernitng, we might have received information frol B K
their conquerors fufiicient to guide us in this inquiry. If the _--
tranfaaions of people, unacquainted with the ue of letters,
were not involved in impenetrable obscurity, we might have
derived some information from their domeflic source. But as
nothing fatisfalcory can be gatlered, ither fiom the accounts
of the Spaniards, or from their own traditions, we must have
recourse to conjcui-res, in order to explain the irregular ap-
pearances in the political state of the people whom I have men-
tioned. As all those tribes which had loft their native liberty
and independence were feated in te Torrid Zone, or in counll
tries approaching to it, the climate may be ilppofed to have
had some influence in forming their minds to that IcrvitLuc,
which seems to be the defiiny of man in those regions of the
globe. But though the influence of climate, more powerful
than that of any other natural caufc, is not to be ovcrlookedl
that alone cannot be admitted as a olution of the point in
question. The operations of men are so complex, that we Inufl:
not attribute the form which they all;lnc, to the force of a
single principle or caufi. Although

..-v. Americans. They were fettled nations, residing conRantly in

one place. -iunting was not the chief occupation of the for-
mer, and the latter eem hardly to have trusted to it for any
part of their fubfiflence. Both had made filch progress in agri-
culture and arts, that the idea of property was introduced in
some degree in the one community, and fully eflablifhed in the
other. Among people in this state, avarice and ambition have
acquired objects, and have begun to exert their power; views
of interest allure the selfish ; the desire of pre-eminence excites
the enterprising; dominion is courted by both; and paflions ul-
known to man in his savage state prompt the interelted and am-
bitious to encroach on the rightsof their fellow-citizens. Motives,
with which rude nations are equally unacquainted, induce the
people to fibmiit tamely to the usurped authority of their fupe-
riors. But even among nations in this slate, the spirit of fubjecs
could not have been rendered so obsequious, or the power of
rulers so unbounded, without the intervention of superstition.
By its fatal influence, the human mind, in every fRage of its
progress, is deprcffed, and its native vigour and independence
subdued. Whoever can acquire the direCtion of this formidable
engine, is secure of dominion over his fpecics. Unfortunately
for the people whole inflitutions are the subjet of inquiry,
this power was in the liands of their chiefs. The caziques of
the illcs could put what rclionfes they plcafed into the mouths
i)t their CoN/i. or gods; and it was by their intcrpofition, and
il thcir name, tliat they inlplld any tribute or lburdcn on their
people . ''lie great chicf of the Natchlez was the principal

was educated in the innermoll recess of their principal temple,
under such austere discipline, and witli fuich peculiar rites, as
tended to fill his fuljes with high fentinents concerning the
sanctity of his character, and the dignity of his tfation '. Thus
superstition, whicl, in the rudest period of focicty, is either
altogether unknown, or warcs its foice in childitlh unmeaning
pracices, had acquired such an afcendlalnt over tlofe people of
America, who had made some little progress towards refine-
ment, that it became the chief infirunlient of bending their minds
to an untimely servitude, and fubjcced them, in the beginnin;
of their political career, to a dcfpotifm hardly less rigorous, than
that which awaits nations in the last fIage of their corruption
and decline.

V. After examining the political inflitutions of the rude na- 'Tr all t

tions in America, the next object of attention is their art of
war, or their provision or public curity and cdefence. I he
finall tribes difpcrrcld over America are not only independent
and unconneCted, but engaged in perpetual Ihoilitics with one

B O OiK attention. I3ut as their territories are extenfivc, and the boun-
'--v-- ' daries of them not exacly ascertained, innumerable fubjeds of

difputc arise, which seldom terminate without bloodfled. Even
in this simple and primitive slate of society, intercft is a source
ofdifcord, and often prompts savage tribes to take arms, in or-
der to repel or punish such as encroach on the forefis or plains,
to which they trufi for fubfifencc.

Their mo- BUT interefl is not either the mofl frequent or the molt

r-"' lThefe mutt be imputed to the pafion of revenge, which ragcs

with Itch violence in the breafi 6f savages, that eagerncs to
gratify it may be confidered as the distinguishing charader-
iliic of men, in their uncivilized slate. Circumfiances of pow-
erf.ul influence, both in the interior government of rude tribes,
and in their external operations againfl foreign enemies, coin-
cur in cheriflhing and adding flrength to a pafTion fatal to the
general tranquillity. VWhen the right of rctrefling his own
wrongs is left in the liands of every individual, injuries are
felt with exquisite cfnfibility, and v engeance exercicfd with
unrelenting rancour. No time can obliterate the memory of
an oence, and it is flldom that it can be expiated but by the

the public vengeance. War, which between extenlive kint- 1--.--
doms is carried on with little animosity, is prosecutcd by fa!l
tribes with all the rancour of a private quarrel. The rcrent-
mentof nations is as implacable as that of individuals. It may 1i c '!,.r f-_
be diffimbled or fupprfc(td, but is never cxtinguiicd ; and \.::!,
often, when leafi cxpedcd or dreaded, it burrs out with rc-
doubled fury '. When poliflcd nations have obtained thc glory
of viiory, or have acquired an addition of territory, they may
terminate a war with honour. But savages are not fatislicd
until they extirpate the community, which is the objc-- of their
rage. They fight not to conquer, but to destroy. If they en-
gage in hoflilities, it is with a reiloltion never to fee tle face
of the enemy in peace, but to profccute tle quarrel with im-
mortal cnmity '. The dcfire of vengeance is the firll, and
alnofi the only principle, which a favagc inflils into the minds
of his children ". This grows up with him as lie advances in
life; and as his attention is directed to few obje&s, it acquires
a degree of force unknovwn among men whose paflions arc dif-
fipated and weakenel by the variety of their occutp),ltiois and
pulrfuits. Thei dcfire of xvengeance, vwhich takes )poffcifon of
the heart of favagcs, rccmblecs the inillA'ivc rage of an ani-
mal, rather than tice pallion of a man. It turns, with u1n-
dificrning fury, even againll inanimate objcc's. If' hurt acci-
dentally by a flone, they often fcize it in a transport of anger,
and endcavour to wreak their vengeance upon it". Ifi firuck

With refpcA to their enemies, the rage of vengeance knows
no bounds. When under the dominion of this paflion, man
becomes the most cruel of all animals. He neither pities, nor
forgives, nor spares.

TI E force of this pafflon is so well underflood by the

Americans themfelvcs, that they always apply to it, in order
to excite their people to take arms. If the elders of any tribe
attempt to rouze their youth from sloth, if a chief withes to
allure a band of warriors to follow him in invading an enemy's
country, the molt persuasive topics of their martial eloquence
are drawn from revenge. " The bones of our countrymen,"
fay-they, " lie uncovered; their bloody bed has not been washcd
clean. Their spirits cry against us; they must be appeased. Let
us go and devour the people by whom they were slain. Sit no
longer inactive upon your mats; lift the hatchet, console the
spirits of the dead, and tell them that they shall be avenged '."

and their per- ANIMATED with such exhortations, the youth fiatch their
pltLlity. arms in a transport of fury, raise the song of war, and burn

with impatience to embrue their hands in the blood of their
enemies. Private chiefs often assemble finall parties, and invade
a hostile tribe, without consulting the rulers of the community.

nive at such irregular allies, as they tend to cherish a martial
spirit, and accustom their people to enterprise and danger'.
But when a war is national, and undertaken by public autho-
rity, the deliberations are formal and flow. The elders as-
femble, they deliver their opinions in solemn speeches, they
weigh with maturity the nature of the enterprise, and balance
its beneficial or disadvantageous consequences with no incon-
fiderable portion of political discernment or sagacity. Their
prierts and soothsayers are consulted, and ometimes they ak
the advice even of their women ". If the determination be for
war, they prepare for it with much ceremony. A leader offers
to conduEt the expedition, and is accepted. But no man is con-
strained to follow him; the resolution of the community to
commence hoflilities, imposes no obligation upon any member
to take part in the war. Each individual is still master of his
own condut, and his engagement in the service is perfecly
voluntary ,

among more civilized and populous nations, are well suited to

would require a greater effort of foresight and indufry, than is
usual among savages, to provide for their fubfiflence, during a

rior, besides his arms, carries a mat and a fiall bag of pounded
maize, and with these is completely equipped for any service.
\hile at a diflance from the enemies frontier, they difperfc
through the woods, and support themselves with the game
which they kill, or the fish which they catch. As they ap-
proach nearer to the territories of the nation, which they intend
to attacl, they collcd their troops, and advance with greater
caution. Even then they proceed wholly by firatagem and am-
bufcade. They place not their glory in attacking their enemies
with open force. To surprise and destroy is the greatest merit
ofa commander, and tlle highest pride of his followers. War and
hunting are their only occupations, and they condud both with
the fame spirit and the fame arts. They follow the track of
their enemies through the forest. They endeavour to discover
their haunts, they lurk in some thicket near to these, and with
tle patience of a fportfinan lying in wait for game, will conti-
nue in their station day after day, until they can rush upon their
prey when mofl secure, and least able to resist them. If they
meet no fraggling party of the enemy, they advance towards
their villages, but with such solicitude to conceal their own ap-
proach, that they often creep on their hands and feet through the
woods, and paint their skins of the fame colour with the withered
leaves, in order to avoid detection Y. If to fortunate as to remain

all their addrcfs and precautions, they find that their motions
are discovercd, that the enemy has taken the alarm, and is pre-
pared to oppose them, they usually deem it molt prudent to rc-
tire. They regard it as extrcme folly to meet an cncrny who
is on his guard, upon equal terms, or to give battle in an open
field. The most difiinguifhed fucccfs is a difgirace to a leader,
if purchased with any confderable loss of his followers"; and
they never boast of a victory if slaincd with the blood of their
own countrymen . To fall in battle, inflead of being reck!oned

B 00 K so small, the difficulty of rearing niew members, amidst the
'-l---- hardships and dangers of savage life, 'so great, that the life of a

citizen is extremely precious, and the preservation of it becomes
a capital object in their policy. Had the point of honour been
the fame among the feeble American tribes, as among the
powerful nations of Europe, had they been taught to court fame
or vitory in contempt of danger and death, they muff have
been ruined by maxims, so ill adapted to their condition. But
wherever their communities are more populous, so that they
can at with considerable force, and can fultain the loss of feve-
ral of their members, without being sensibly weakened, the mi-
litary operations of the Americans more nearly resemble those
of other nations. The Brafilians, as well as the tribes situated
upon the banks of the river De la Plata, often take the field in
such numerous bodies, as deserve the name of armies '. They
defy their enemies to the combat, engage in regular battles,
and maintain the conflict with that desperate ferocity, which is
natural to men, who, having no idea of war but that of exter-
minating their enemies, never give or take quarter . In the
powerful empires of Mexico and Peru, great armies were affcm-
bled, frequent battles were fought, and the theory as well as
practice of war were different from what took place in those
petty societies which assume the name of nations.

Incnpable of BUT though vigilance and attention are the qualities chiefly
order or dis
iplinc. requisite, where the objet of war is to deceive and to surprise;

and though the Americans, when :.i:ng singly, dif'iay an
amazing degree of address in concealing their own motions,
and in discovering those of an enemy, yet it is remarkable

that,

that, 'when they take the 'field in parties, they can seldom be B O O K
brought to observe the precautions most eflential to their own ---
security. Such is the difficulty of accuiftoming savages to sub-
ordinmation, or to ad in concert; such is their impatience under
reRfraint, and such their caprice and presumption, that it is
rarely they can be brought to conform themselves to the coun-
fels and diretions of their leaders. They never flation centi-
nels around the place where they reft at night, and after march-
ing some hundred miles to furprile an enemy, are often fur-
prifed thenmfelves, and cut off, while funk in as profound sleep
as if they were not within reach of danger .

IF, notwithstanding this negligence and security, which often

frustrate their most artful fchemnes, they catch the enemy un-
prepared, they rush upon them with the utmost ferocity, and
tearing off the scalps of all those who fall vidims to their rage ',
they carry home those itrange trophies in triumph. These
they preserve as monuments, not only of their own prowess,
but of the vengeance which their arm has inflicted upon the
people who were objects of public resentment'. They are fill
more Solicitous to seize prisoners. During their retreat, if they
hope to effed it unmolefled, these are commonly exempt from
any insult, and treated with some degree of humanity, though
guarded with the moi flridt attention.

BUT after this temporary suspension, their rage rekindles with Treatmentaf

nrew fury. As soon as they approach their own frontier, some of prioncr".
their number are dispatchcd to inform their countrymen with
rcfpect to the success of the expedition. Then the prisoners

B o o K; begin to feel the wretchedness of their condition. The women
I--,_' of the village, together with the youth who have not attained

to the age of bearing arms, assemble, and forming themselves
into two lines, through which the prisoners muf pass, beat and
bruise them with flicks or sones in a cruel manner k. After
this firfl gratification of their rage against their enemies, follow
lamentations for the Iofs of such of their own countrymen as have
fallen in the service, accompanied with words and ations which
seem to express the utmost anguifl and grief. But, in a moment,
upon a signal given, their tears cease; they pass, with a sudden
and unaccountable transition, from the depths of sorrow to
transports of joy; and begin to celebrate their vitory with all
the wild exultation of a barbarous triumph'. The fate of
the prisoners remains ill undecided. The old men deliberate
concerning it. Some are deflined to be tortured to death, in
order to satiate the revenge of the conquerors; ome to replace
the members which the community has loft in that or former
wars. They who are reserved for this milder fate, are led to
the huts of those whose friends have been killed. The women
meet them at the door, and if they receive them, their susser-
ings are at an end. They are adopted into the family, and,
according to their phrase, are feated upon the mat of the deceased.
They assume his name, they hold the fame rank, are treated
thenceforward with all the tenderness due to a father, a brother,
a liufband, or a friend. But if, either fiom capricc, or an un-
relenting dcire of revenge, the women of any family refuse to
accept of the prilbncr who is offered to them, his doom is fixed.
No power can then save him from torture and death.

assemble as to a solemn festival, resolved to put the fortitude of
the captive to the utmost proof. A scene cnfucs, the bare de-
scription of which is enough to chill the heart with horror,
wherever men have been accustomed, by milder inflitutions, to
refpet their fpccies, and to melt into tenderncfs at the fight of
human fufferiings. The prisoners are tied naked to a flake,
but so as to be at liberty to move around it. All who are
present, men, women, and children, ufh upon them like
furies. Every species of torture is applied that the rancour
of revenge can invent. Some burn their limbs with reel-
hot irons, some mangle their bodies with knives, others tv
their flesh from their bones, pluck out their nails by the
roots, and rend and twist their sinews. They vie with one
another in refinements of torture. Nothing sets bounds to their
rage, but the dread of abridging the duration of their ven-
geance by hafrening the death of the fuflnercrs; and ffiLch is their
cruel ingenuity in tormenting, that by avoiding idllrifily
to hurt any vital part, they often prolong this fene of arng;uinl
for several days. In ibpite of all that they filllc, the viclims
continue to chant their deathl-long with a firin xv'oi, they boati
of their own exploits, they inlfut llicir tormentors ior theiir
want of skill in avcnging their friends and rclations, they warnl

death, and excite their ferocity by tlhe muot provokilng rc-
proaches and threats. To (liil ;iy undaunMted fortitude in hilLch
dreadful situations, is the noblell tritlmph of a warrior. To
avoid the trial by a voluntary death, or to flrink under it, is

demned

B 0 O K deemed infamous and cowardly. If any one betray symptoms

AV.
.-- -' of timidity, his tormentors often dispatch him: at once with

contempt, as unworthy of being, treated. like a. manm. Ani-
mated with those ideas, they endure, without. a groan, what it
seems almost impoilible that human nature fould sustain. They
appear to be not only insensible of pain, but to court it. " For-
bear, said an aged chief of the Iroquois, when his insults had
provoked one of his tormentors to wound him with a knife,
forbear there stabs of your knife, and rather let me die by fire,
that those dogs, your allies, from beyond the sea, may learn by
my example to susser like men "." This magnanimity, of
which there are frequent inflances among the American war-
riors, inflead of exciting admiration, or calling forth sympathy,
exasperates the fierce spirits of their torturers to fresh ads of
cruelty °. Weary at length of contending with men, whose
constancy of mind they cannot vanquish, ome chief in a rage
puts a period to their sufferings, by dispatching them with his
dagger or club .

Sometimes THIS barbarous scene is often succeeded by one no less
eat their pri-
foners. prfocking. As it is impossible to appease the fell spirit of re-

venge which rages in the heart of a savage, this frequently
prompts the Americans to devour those unhappy persons, who
have been the vidims of their cruelty. In the ancient world,
tradition has preserved the memory of barbarous nations of

in those parts, where circumflances, with which we are un-
acquainted, had in a great meafire al)olillcd this pratlice, it
stems formerly to have been so well known, that it is incorpo-
rated into the idiom of their language. Among the Iroquois,
the phrase by which they express their resolution of nmnkill-
war against an enemy is, " Let us go and eat that nation." Ii
they solicit the aid of a neighbouring tribe, they invite it to
" eat broth made of the flenli of their enemies '." Nor, was
the pracice peculiar to rude unpolifhed tribes, the principle
from which it took rife, is so deeply rooted in the minds of the
Americans, that it fublifled in Mexico, one of te civilized em-
pires in the New World, and relics of it may be lifcovered(
among the more mild inhabitants of Peru. It was not scarcity
of food, as ome authors imagine, and the importunate cravings
of hunger, which forced the Americans to those horrid rcpafis
on their fellow-creatures. Human iefle was never uscd as
common food in any country, and the various relations concern-
ing people, who reckoned it among the flated means of fubfifl-
ence, flow from the credulity and miflakcs of travellers. The
rancour of revenge first prompted men to this barbarous ation ".

Tire people of South-America gratify their revenge in a

manner fomnewhat different, but with no lets unrelenting ran-
cour. There, prisoners, after meeting at their firfl entrance,
with the fame rough reception as among the North-Americans ',
are not only exempt from injury, but treated with the greatest
kindness. They are feafled and caressed, and some beautiful
young women are appointed to attend and solace them. It is
not easy to account for this part of their conduCt, unless we im-
pute it to a refinement in cruelty. For, while they seem fludious
to attach the captives to life, by supplying them with every
enjoymicnt that can render it agreeable, their doom is irrevo-
cably fixed. On a day appointed, the vitorious tribe assembles,
the prisoner is brought forth with great solemnity, he views the
preparations for the sacrifice with as much indifference, as if lie
himfelfwere not the victim, an(d meeting his fate with un-
daunted firmness, is dispatched with a single blow. The mo-
ment he falls, the women seize the body, and dress it for the
feast. They bcfmear their children with the blood, in order
to kindle in their bosoms a hatred of their enemies, which is
never extinguished, and all join in feeding upon the flel with
amazing grecdinefs and exultation ". To devour the body of
a flaughtcred enemy, they deem the most complete and exqui-
litc gratification of revenge. Wherever this practice prevails,

As the conflancy of every American warrior may be put to fiich

severe proof, the great objea of education and discipline in tlie
NewWorld is to form the mind to fuflltin it. When nations carry
on war with open force, defy their enemies to thc combat, and
vanquill them by the superiority of their skill or courage, fol-
diers are trained to be aive, vigorous, and enterprising. But in
America, where the genius and maxims of war are extremely
different, passive fortitude is the quality in highefl eclimation.
Accordingly, it is early the fludy of the Americans to acquire
a talent, which will enable them to belave like men, when
their resolution flall be put to the proof. As the youth of
other nations exercise themselves in feats of ativity and force,
those of America vie with one anotler in exhibitions of their
patience under sufferings. They harden their nerves by thoii
voluntary trials, and gradually accuflom thcifclves to endure
the sharpest pain, without complaining. A boy and girl will
bind their naked arms together, and place a burning coal be-
tween them, in order to try who firlt difcovcrs ficli impaticnce
as to hake it off'. All the trials, cultomary in America, when
a youth is admitted into the class of warriors, or wllcn a warrior
is promoted to the dignity of captain or chief, are accommo-
dated to this idea of manlinels. Thicy arc not displays of va-
lour, but of patience ; they are not exhibitions of tlcir ability
to offend, but of their capacity to fufFclr. Anmong the tribes on

'-v--' any ever observed by the molt abstemious hermit. At the close

of this, the chiefs assemble, each gives him three lafles with
a large whip, applied so vigorously, that his body is almolt
flayed, and if he betrays the least symptom of impatience o
even sensibility, he is diigraced for ever, and rejeaced as un-
worthy of the honour. After some interval, the conflancy
of the candidate is proved by a more excruciating trial. le is
laid in a hammoc with his hands bound fast, and an innumerable
multitude of venomous ants, whose bite occasions exquisite
pain, and produces a violent inflammation, are thrown upon
him. The judges of his merit stand around the hammoc, and,
while these cruel infecs fasten upon the moit sensible parts of
his body, a sigh, a groan, an involuntary motion expreflive of
what e fufl'ers, wou'd exclude him f£om te dignity which he
is ambitious to obtain. Even after this evidence of his forti-
tude, it is not deemed to be completely ascertained, but mul:

dergone. I-e is again suspended in his hammoc, and covered
with leaves of the palmetto. A fire of slinking herbs is kin-
(led underneath, so as he may feel its heat, and be involved
in smoke. Though scorched and almooft fffocated, he mutu
continue to endure with the fame patient insensibility. Many
pcrifli in this rude eay of their firmness and courage, but
fuclh as go through it with applause, receive the ensigns of their
new dignity with much solemnity, and are ever after regardcd
as leaders of approved resolution, whose behaviour, in the mott

America, the previous trial of a warrior is neither so formal, B 0 o K
nor so severe. Though even there, before a youth is permitted I-.
to bear arms, his patience and fortitude are proved by blows,
by fire, and by insults, more intolerable to a haughty spirit than
both .

THE amazing teadincfs, with which the Americans en-

dure the most exquisite torments, has induced some authors to
fiuppofe that, from the peculiar feebleness of their frame, their
sensibility is not so acute as that of other people; as women,
and persons of a relaxed habit, are observed to be less affc'ced
with pain than robust men, whose nerves are more firmly braced.
But the conflitution of the Americans is not so different, in its
texture, from that of the reft of the human fpccics, as to ac-
count for this diverfty in their behaviour. It flows from a
principle of honour, inflillcd early and cultivated with such care,
as to inspire man in his rdclc fate with an heroic magnani-
Inity, to which philosophy hath endeavourcd, in vain, to form
him, when more highly improved and polilicl. This invin-
cible conflancy he has been tauight to conlidcer as thi chief
diftinQion of man, and the highcft attainment of a warrior.
The ideas which influence his condluc, and the pallions which
take pofleflion of his heart, are few. They operate of collrfc
with more dccifive cffer, than when the mind is crowded with
a multiplicity of objeEs, or difiradccd by the variety of its pr-
filits ; and when every motive that operates with force on the
fentimcnts of a {fvage, prompts him to fifl'cr with dignity, lie

I; o o i to sustain. But wherever te fortitude of the Americans is nor

---- routed to exertion by their ideas of honour, their fclings of

pain are the fame with those of the refl of mankind . Nor is
that patience under sufferings for which the Americans have
been so jufily celebrated an universal attainment. The con-
ftancy of many of the victims is overcome by the agonics of
torture. Their weakness and lamentations complete the triumph
of their enemies, and reflect disgrace upon their country .

Iw,!Ati by THE perpetual hostilities carried on among the American

their prpc
rial was. tribes are produative of very fatal effecqs. As their imperfect

indufiry does not fipply them witl any superfluous fiore of
provisions, even in seasons of tranquillity, when the irruption
of an enemy desolates their cultivated lands, or disturbs them
in their hunting excursions, such a calamity reduces a commu-
nity, naturally unprovident and deflitute of resources, to ex-
treme want. All the people of the diftric that is invaded, are
frequently forced to take refuge in woods or mountains, which
can afford them no fubfilence, and where many of them pcrifh.
Notwithstanding their exccffive caution in conducting their mili-
tary operations, and the solicitude of every leader to preserve
the lives of his followers, as the rude tribes in America seldom
enjoy any interval of peace, the lols of men among them is
considerable in proportion to the degree of population. Thus
fhmine and the sword combine in thinning their numbers. All
their communities are feeble, and nothing now remains of
lCveral nations, which were once considerable, but the name ".

savages, than considerations of policy. Far the greater part of
their captives was anciently sacrificed to their vengeance, and it
is only since their numbers began to decline fafl, that they have
adopted milder maxims. But such as they do naturalize, re-
nounce for ever their native tribe, and aline the manners as
well as passions of the people by whom they are adopted , si
entirely, that they often join them in expeditions against their
own countrymen. Such a sudden transition, and bl repugnant
to one of the molt powerful inftinCs implanted by nature, would
appear strange among many people; but, among the members
of inall communities, where national enmity is violent and
deep-rooted, it is more unaccountable. It seems, however, to
result naturally fiom the principles upon which war is carried on
in America. When nations aim at exterminating their enemies,
no exchange of prilfners can ever take place. From the moment
one is made a priloner, his country and his friends considcr him
as (lead . He has incurred indelible dilgrace by fulfcring hiinm-
fclf to be surprised or to be taken by an cnemcy ; and were lie to

As the unfortunate captive is thus an outcast from his own
country, and the ties which bound him to it are irreparably
broken, lie feels less reluctance in forming a new, conneion
with people, who, as an evidence of their friendly sentiments,
not only deliver him from a cruel death, but offer to admit him
to all the rights of a fellow-citizen. The perfect similarity of
manners among savage nations facilitates and completes the
union, and induces a captive to transfer not only his allegi-
ance, but his affecion, to the community into the bosom of
which he is received.

Tlie;rifcri- BUT though war be the chief occupation of men in their
oli.y in war

petition with polished nations. Deflitute of that foresight
which discerns and provides for remote events, firangers to the
union and mutual confidence requisite in forming any extensive
plan of operations, and incapable of the ubordination no less
requisite in carrying into execution such plans, savage nations
may astonish a disciplined enemy by their valour, but seldom
prove formidable to him by their conduct, and whenever the
contest is of long continuance, mull yield to superior art ". The
empires of Peru and Mexico, though their progress in civili-
fation, when measured by the European or Asiatic flandards,

was inconsiderable, acquired such an ascendency over the rude B 0 K
tribes around them, that they fubjeded molt of them with great I
facility to their power. When the people of Europe over-ran
the various provinces of America, this superiority was fill more
conspicuous. Neither the courage nor number of the natives
could repel a handful of invaders. The alienation and enmity,
prevalent among barbarians, prevented them from uniting in
any common scheme of defence, and while each tribe fought
separately, all were subdued.

VI. THE arts of rude nations unacquainted with the use of Their ar.

metals, hardly merit any attention on their own account, but
are worthy of rome notice, as far as they serve to display the
genius and manners of a people. The first difrefs a savage Drefsandor-
mullt fee!, will arise from the manner in which his body is as- nanents
fedced, by the heat, or cold, or moisture, of the climate
under which he lives; and his first care will be, to provide ome
covering for his own defence. In the warmer and more mild
climates of America, none of the rude tribes were clothed. To
most of them Nature had not even fuggelted any idea of impro-
pricty in being altogether uncovered'. As under a mild cli-
mate there was little need of any defence from the injuries
of the air, and their extreme indolence hunned every fpe-
cies of labour to which it was not urged by absolute necef-
fity, all the inhabitants of the ies, and a considerable part
of the people on the continent, remained in this state of naked
simplicity. Others were satisfied with ome flight covering,
such as decency required. But though naked, they were not
unadorned. They drefned their hair in many dillercnt forms.

B O K They faflened bits of gold, or shells, or shining stones, in their

~I-- ears, their noses, and cheeks'. They stained their ikins witl

a great variety of figures; and they spent much time, and sub-
mitted to great pain, in ornamenting their persons in this fan-
taftic manner. Vanity, however, which finds endless occupa-
tion for ingenuity and invention, in nations where dress has
become a complex and intricate art, is circumscribcd within so
narrow bounds, and confined to so few articles among naked
savages, that they are not satisfied with those simple decora-
tions, and have a wonderful pro;enfity to alter the natural
form of their bodies. This praf:c c . ;is univcrfal among the
rudefi of the American tribes. Ti.tcir operations for that pur-
pose begin as soon as an infa:it is born. By compressing the
bones of the skull, while ftili loft and flexible, some flatten the
crown of their heads; so!ne Iqueeze them into the hape of a
cone; others mould them as much as possible into a square
figure,; and they often endanger the lives of their posterity by
their violent and absurd efforts to derange the plan of Nature,.
or to improve upon her designs. But in all their attempts
either to adorn or to new-model their persons, it seems to have
been less the objec of the Americans to please, or to appear
beautiful, tlan to give an air of dignity and terror to their
aspet. Their attention to dress had more reference to war
than to gallantry. The difference in rank and estimation be-
tween the two sexes was so great, as extinguilhed, in tome
measure, their solicitude to appear mutually amiable. The
man deemed it beneath him to adorn his person, for the fake
of one on whom he was accuflomed to look down as a slave.

It was when the warrior had in view to enter the council of his B o0 Ic

nation, or to take the field against its enemies, that lie aumed l---
his choicest ornaments, and decked his person with the nicest
care. The decorations of the women were few and simple;
whatever was precious or splendid was reserved for the men.
In everal tribes the women were obliged to spend a considerable
part of their time every day in adorning and painting their
hubands, and could beltow little attention upon ornamenting
themselves. Among a race of men so haughty as to despise,
or so cold as to neglect them, the women naturally became
careless and slovenly, and the love of finery and shew, which
has been deemed their favourite passion, was confined chiefly
to the other sex'. To deck his person was the diflinflion of
a warrior, as well as one of his nmot serious occupations'.
In one part of their dress, which, at first fight, appears the
mos singular and capricious, the Americans have discovered
considerable sagacity in providing against the chief inconve-
niencies of their climate, which is often sultry and moit to ex-
ccs. All the different tribes, which remain unclothed, are ac-
cuflomed to anoint and rub their bodies with the g'rcafe of
animals, with viscous gums, and with oils of different kinds.
By this they check that profuse perspiration, whiclh, in the torrid
zone, waftes the vigour of the framc, and abridges the plcriod of.
human life. By this too, they provide a defence againl(l the ex-

Habitations. THE next objet to dress that will engage the attention of a si-

vage, is to prepare some habitation that may afford him ihelter by
day, and a retreat at night. Whatever is connected with his ideas
of personal dignity, whatever bears any reference to his military
character, the savage warrior deems an objec of importance.
Whatever relates only to peaceable and inactive life, he views
with perfect indifference. Hence, though finically attentive to
dress, he is little solicitous about the elegance or disposition of
his habitation. Savage nations, far from that slate of improve-
ment,. in which the mode of living is confidered as a mark of
diftindion, and unacquainted with those wants, which require
a variety of accommodation, regulate the conftruacion of their
houses according to their limited ideas of neceflity.. Some of
the American tribes were so extremely rude, and had advanced
so little beyond the primeval simplicity of nature, that they had
no houses at all. During the day, they take helter from the
scorching rays of the fun under thick trees,; at night they form
a flied with their branches and leaves". In the rainy season
they retire into covers, formed by the hand of Nature, or hol-
lowed out by their own industry ". Others, who have no fixed

abandon without any concern. The inhabitants of those va il
plains, which are deluged by the overflowing of rivers dur-
ing the heavy rains that fall periodically between the tropics,.
raise houses upon piles faflened in the ground, or place them
among the boughs of trees, and are thus safe amidst that wide
extended inundation which surrounds them °. Such were the
first efays of the rudest Americans towards providing them-
selves with habitations. But even among tribes which were
more improved, and whose residence was become altogether
fixed, the firuaure of their houses was extremely mean and
simple. They were wretched huts, sometimes of an oblong
and ometimes of a circular form, intended merely for shelter,
with no view to elegance, and little attention to conveniency.
The doors were so low, that it was necessary to bend or to creep
on the hands and feet in order to enter them. They were
without windows, and had a large hole in the middle of the
roof, to convey out the smoke. To follow travellers in other
minute circumfiances of their description, is not only beneath
the dignity of history, but would be foreign to the objec: of
my researchess One circumstance merits attention, as it is fin-
gular, and illufirates the characdcr of the people. Some of their
houses were so large as to contain accommodation for fourscore
or a hundred persons. These were built for the reception of
different families, which (dwelt together under the fame roof ,
and often around a common fire, without separate apartments,
or any kind of fcrecn or partition between the spaces which
they refp)civcly occupied. As soon as men have acquired dif-
tinc ideas of property; or when they are so much attached to
their females, as to watch them with care and jcaloufy; fami-

A-_3 - can secure and guard whatever they wish to preserve. This

singular mode of habitation may therefore be confidered not
only as the effe of that community of goods which fubfifled
among the several people in America, but as a proof of inat-
tention and indifference towards their women. If they had not
been accustomed to perfect equality, such an arrangement could
not have taken place. If their sensibility had been apt to have
taken alarm, they would not have trufled the virtue of their
women amidst the temptations and opportunities of such a pro-
mifcuous intercourse. At the fame time, the perpetual concord
which reigns in habitations where so many families are crowded
together, is surprising, and affords a striking evidence that they
muff be people of either a very gentle, or of a very phlegmatic
tempe,, who, in such a situation, are unacquainted with animo-
fity, brawling, and discord '.
Their arms. AFTER making some provision for his dress and habitation, a

savage will perceive the necessity of preparing proper arms with
which to assault or repel an enemy. This, accordingly, has early
exercised the ingenuity and invention of all rude nations. The
first offenlive weapons were doubtlcfs such as chance prefcnted,
and the firfl: efforts of art to improve upon t .el, were extremely
aukward and imple. Clubs made of some heavy wood, flakes
hardened in the fire, lances whose heads were armed with flint
or the bones of some anim il, are weapons known to the rudest
nations. All these, howevcr, were of use only in close cncoun-

ter. But men wished to annoy their enemies while at a B 0 C

:

distance, and the bow and arrow is the most early invention for i-----
this purpose. This weapon is in the hands of people, whofl
advances in improvement are extremely inconfiderab!e, and i.
familiar to the inhabitants of every quarter of the globe. It
is remarkable, however, that some tribes in America were si
destitute of art and ingenuity, that they had not attained to the
discovery of this simple invention°, and seem to have been un-
acquainted with the use of any miflive weapon. The fling,
though in its conflruation not more complex than the bow, and
among many nations of equal antiquity, was little known tu
the people of North Americap or the islands, but appears to
have been used by a few tribes in the foutliern continent'. The
people in fomc provinces of Chili, and those of Patagonia, to-
wards the southern extremity of America, use a weapon pecu-
liar to themnfelves. They fasten stones about the size of a fit to
each end of a leather thong of eight feet in length, and swing-
ing these round their heads, throw them with such dexterity
that they seldom miss the ojed at wlich they aim .

AMONG people who had hardly any occupation but war or Theirdonmcr

hunting, the chief evertions of thcir invention ', as well as in- tic t"cfi"!.
(dufr, were: naturally directed towards thefc objecs. With

towards refinement and luxury, for men in their rudest state
were not acquainted with any method of dressing their victuals,
but by roafling them on the fire; and among several tribes in

Coniruaion America, this is the only species of cookery yet known . But the
of their ca-
noes. mailer-piece of art, among the savages of America, is the con-

ftruaion of their canoes. An Efkimaux, hut up in his boat of
whale-bone, covered with the skins of feals, can brave that flormy
ocean, on which the barrenness of his country compels him to
depend for the chief part of his subsistence'. The people of
Canada venture upon their rivers and lakes, in boats made of
the bark of trees, and so light that two men can carry them,
wherever ihallows or cataraas obflruct the navigationY. In
there frail veflels they undertake and accomplish long voyages .
The inhabitants of the isles and of the southern continent form
their canoes by hollowing the trunk of a large tree, with in-
finite labour, and though in appearance extremely aukward and
unwieldy, they paddle and fleer them with such dexterity, that
Europeans well acquainted with all the improvements in the
science of navigation, have been astonished at the rapidity of
their motion, and the quickness of their evolutions. Their
pirogues, or war-boats, are so large as to carry forty or fifty
men; their canoes employed in filhing and in flort voyages

in operations which seem the most interefling, and where the
most powerful motives urge them to vigorous exertions, they
labour with a languid listlessness. Their work advances under
their hand with such slowness, that an eye-witness compares it
to the imperceptible progress of vegetation '. They will spend so
many years in forming a canoe, that it often begins to rot with
age before they finish it. They will susser one part of a roof
to decay and perish, before they complete the other'. The
slightest manual operation consumes a vast length of time, and
what in polished nations would hardly be an effort of indufiry,
is among savages an arduous undertaking. This slowness of
the Americans in executing works of every kind may be im-
puted to various causes. Among savages, whlo do not depend
for subsistence upon the efforts of regular induliry, time is of
so little importance, that they fct no value upon it; and pro-
vided they can finifl a dcfign, they nevcr r'cgard how long
they are employed about it. The tools which they employ are
so aukward and defective, tliat every work in wlicl they

peculiar to the Americans renders their operations languid. It
is almost impoilible to rouze them from that habitual indolence
in which they are funk; and unless when engaged in war or
hunting, they seem incapable of exerting any vigorous effort:
Their ardour of application is not so great as to call forth that
inventive spirit which suggests expedients for facilitating and
abridging labour. They will return to a talk day after day,
but all their methods of executing it are tedious and operose:.
Even since the Europeans had communicated to, them the
knowledge of their infiruments, and taught them to imitate their

attempt they make. They may be patient and afliduous in la-

tion, that we discover this total insensibility to the impressions
*of any invisible power. But the human mind, formed for re-
ligion, soon opens to the reception of ideas, which are deffined,
when corrceted and refined, to be the great source of confola-
tion amidfl the calamities of life. Among ome of the Ame-
rican tribes, flill in the infancy of improvement, we discern
apprchenfions of some invisible and powerful beings. These
apprehenlions are originally indiftind and perplexed, and seem
to be suggested rather by the dread of impending evils, than
.to flow from gratitude for bleflings received. While Nature
holds on her course with uniform and undiflurbed regularity,
men enjoy the benefits resulting from it, without inquiring
concernig its cause. But every deviation from this regular
course rouzes and atonifhes them. When they behold events
to which they are not accuflomed, they search for the reasons
of them with eager curiosity. Their understanding is unable
to penetrate into there; but imagination, a more forward and
ardent faculty of the mind, decides without hesitation. It
arcribes the extraordinary occurrences in nature to the influence
of invisible beings, and supposes that the thunder, the hurri-
cane, and the earthquake, are effets of their intcrpofition.
Some such confuted notion of fpirituai or invisible power,
fuiperintending over those natural calamities which frequently
dcfolate the earth, and terrify its inhabitants, may be traced
ainong many rude nationsk. But besides this, the difaftcrs
and dangers of flivagc life arc fT many, and men often find

protection of wisdom and power superior to what is human. B K
Deje&ed with calamities which oppress him, and exposed to '--
dangers which he cannot repel, the savage no longer relies
upon himself; he feels his own impotence, and fees no profpe2
of being extricated, but by the interposition of ome invisible
arm. Hence, in all unenlightened nations, the firlf rites or
pradices which bear any resemblance to ads of religion, have
it for their object to avert evils which men susser or dread.
The Manitous or Okkis of the North Americans were amulets
or charms, which they imagined to be of such virtue, as to
preserve the persons who reposed confidence in them from every
difaflrous event,, or they were confidered as tutelary spirits,.
whose aid they might implore in circumirances of difrefs'.
The Cemis of the islanders were reputed by them the authors
of every calamity that aflias the human race; they were re-
presented under the most frightful forms, and religious ho-
mage was paid to them with no other view than to appease
these furious deities ". Even among those tribes whose reli-
gious system was more enlarged, and who had formed some
conception of benevolent beings, delighted with conferring
benefits, as well as of malicious powers prone to inflil evil;
fuperilition still appears as the offspring of fear, and all its es-
forts were employed to avert calamities. They were perfiaded
that their good deities, prompted by the b)cnficcnce of their
nature, would beflto every l)lcfliig in their power, without
solicitation or acknowledgment ; and their only anxiety was to.
soothe and deprecate the wrath of the powers whom they re-
garded as the enemies of mankind ".

agents, and such, almost univcrfally, was the mean and illi-

ideas of other nations to that rude fate in which history first
presents them to our view, we should discover a surprising re-
femblancc in their tenets and pratices; and hould be con-
vinced, that, in imilar circumflances, the faculties of the hu-
man mind hold nearly the fame course in their progress, and
arrive at almost the fame conclusions. The inpreiflons of fear
are confpicuols in all the fy/tems of fuperflition formed in this
situation. And the moit exalted notions of men rife no higher
than to a perplexed apprehension of certain beings, whose
power, though supernatural, is limited as well as partial.

Remarkable BUT, among other tribes, which have been longer united,
tdiverfitlin or have made greater progress in improvement, we discern
their elo-
ginus no- some feeble pointing towards more just and adequate concep-

tions of the power that presides in nature. They seem to per-
ceive that there muff be some universal cause to whom all
things are indebted for their being. If we may judge by forme
of their expressions, they appear to acknowledge a divine power
as the maker of the world, and the disposer of all events. They
denominate him the Great Spirit". But these ideas are faint
and confuted, and when they attempt to explain them, it is
manifest, that among them the word spirit has a meaning very
different from that in which we employ it, and that they have
no conception of any deity but what is corporeal. They be-
lieve their gods to be of the human form, though of a nature
more excellent than man, and retail such wild incoherent

B o K of fuperition known in America, and, perhaps, one of the
H_- most natural as well as most Ecducing. The fun is the apparent

source of the joy, fertility, and life, diffused through nature,
and while the human mind, in its early essays towards inquiry,
contemplates and admires his universal and animating energy,
its admiration is apt to flop short at what is viible, without
reaching to the unfcen cauf ; and pays that adoration to te
most glorious and beneficial work of God, which is due only
to him who formed it. As fire is the purest and moit aive
of the elements, and in ome of its qualities and effects re-
fembles the fun, it was, not improperly, chosen to be the
emblem of his powerful operation. The ancient Persians, a
people far superior, in every respect, to that rude tribe whose
rites I am describing, founded their religious system on similar
principles, and established a form of public worship, less gross
and exceptionable than that of any people destitute of guidance
from revelation. This surprising co-incidence in sentiment
between two nations, in such different states of improvement,
is one of the many singular and unaccountable circumstances
which occur in the hiflory of human affairs.

AMONG the people of Bogota, the fun and moon were, like-

wife, the chief objecs ofveneration. Their system of religion was
more regular and complete, though lets pure, than that of the
Natchez. They had temples, altars, priefls, sacrifices, and that
long train of ceremonies, which fuperfiition introduces wherever
she has fully eflablifhed her dominion over the minds of
men. But the rites of their worfhlip were cruel and bloody.
They offered human vitimrs to their deities, and many of their
pracices nearly rcfembled the barbarous inflitutions of the

tremely violent, their impatience under lwhat they fuffcr, and
solicitude for the recovery of health, soon inspired them with
extraordinary reverence for such as pretended to undcrfland
the nature of their maladies, or to preicrve them from their
sudden and fatal effeas. These ignorant pretenders, however,
were fich utter strangers to the ftru'ture of the human frame,
as to be equally unacquainted with the caufcs of its diobrders,
and the manner in which they will terminate. Superfiition,
mingled frequently with some portion of craft, supplied what
they wanted in fcicnce. They imputed the origin of diifcaes
to supernatural influence, and preicribed or performed a variety
of mysterious rites, which they gave out to be of power fuffi-
cient to remove them. The credulity and love of the mar-
vellous,.,natural to uninformed men, favoured the deception,
and prepared them to be the dupes of their imposture. Among
savages, their first physicians are a kind of conjurers or wizards,
who boast that they know what is palt, and can foretell what
is to come. Incantations, sorcery, and mummeries of diverse
kinds, no less firange than frivolous, are the means which they
employ to expel the imaginary causes of malignity ; and, re-
lying upon the efficacy of tllefe, they predit with confidence

When the events of war were peculiarly difafirous, when
they met with unforeseen difippointments in hunting, when

extricate him from the former, and to direc his condu in
the latter. Even among the rudest tribes in America, super-
tition appears in this form, and divination is an art in high
eftcem. Long before man had acquired such knowledge of a
deity as inspires reverence and leads to adoration, we observe
him ftrctching out a presumptuous hand to draw aside that
veil with which providence kindly conceals its purposes from
human knowledge; and we find him labouring, with fruitless
anxiety, to penetrate into the mysteries of the divine admini-
ftration. To discern, and to worship a superintending power,
is an evidence of the enlargement and maturity of the human
underfianding ; a vain desire of prying into futurity, is the error
of its infancy, and a proof of its weakness.

FROM this weakness proceeded, likewise, the faith of the

Americans in dreams, their observation of omens, their atten-
tion to the chirping of birds and the cries of animals, all
which they suppose to be indications of fut'ure events, and if
any one of these prognostics is deemed unfavourable, they
instantly abandon the pursuit of those measures on which they
are nmoft eagerly bent .

AMONG savages, in every part of the globe, the love of l.o of

dancing.

dancing is a fvourite pafflon. As a great part of their
time languiihes away in indolence, without any occupation
to rouze or increfi them, they delight univcrlily in a pas-
tine which calls forth the aivc powers of tlhcir nature into
exercise. The Spaniards, when they first visited America,
were astonished at the fondness of the natives for dancing,
and beheld with wonder a people, cold and unanimatcd in nmoil
of their other pursuits, kindle into life, and exert themfcves
with ardour, as often as this favourite amusement recurred.
Among them, indeed, dancing ought not to be denominated
an amusement. It is a serious and important occupation, which
mingles in every occurrence in public or private life. If any
intercourse be necessary between two American tribes, the am-
baffadors of the one approach in a solemn dance, and present
the calumet or emblem of peace; the sachems of the other
receive it with the fame ceremony a. If war is denounced
againfl an enemy, it is by a dance, exprcffive of the resent-
ment which they feel, and of the vengeance which they mcedi-
tate b. If the wrath of tleir gods is to be appcafcd, or their
beneficence to be celebrated ; if they rejoice at the birth of a
child, or mourn the deatl of a fiiend', they have dances ap-
propriated to each of there situations, and luitcd to the dif-
ferent fcntiments with which they are then animated. If a ecrlmi

ALL their dances are imitations of ome aion; and though

the mulic by which they are regulated, is extremely simple
and tiresome to the ear by its dull monotony, ome of their
dances appear wonderfully expressive and animated. The war-
dance is, perhaps, the most firiking. It is the representation
of a complete American campaign. The departure of the war-
riors from their village, their march into the enemy's country,
the caution with which they encamp, the address with which
they flation ome of their party in ambush, the manner of
surprising the enemy, the noise and ferocity of the combat,
the scalping of those who are slain, the seizing of prisoners, the
triumphant return of the conquerors, and the torture of the
viEtims, are fucceflively exhibited. The performers enter with.
such enthusiastic ardour into their several parts, their getfures,
their countenance, their voice are so wild and so well adapted to
their various situations, that Europeans can hardly believe it to
be a mimic scene, or view it without emotions of fear and hor-
rore.

BUT however expressive some of the American dances may

be, there is one circumflance in them remarkable, and con-
nedcd with the charader of the race. The songs, the dances,
the amulcimcnts of other nations, expreflive of the sentiments

which animate their hearts, are often adapted to dil'play or B K
excite that sensibility which mutually attachcs the lfxes. Among v
some people, such is the ardour of this pafiion, that love is al-
mofi the sole object of festivity and joy; and as rude nations
are firangers to delicacy, and unaccustomed to dilguife any
emotion of their minds, their dances are often extremely wan-
ton and indecent. Such is the Calenda, of which the natives
of Africa are so passionately fond e; and such the feats of the
dancing girls, which the Asiatics contemplate with so much
avidity of desire. But, among the Americans, more cold and
indifferent to their females, from causes which I have al-
ready explained, the paflion of love mingles but little with
their feflivals and paflimes. Their songs and dances are nmofly
solemn and martial, they are connected with some of the fe-
rious and important affairs of life', and having no relation to
love or gallantry, are seldom common to the two sexes, but
executed by the men and women apart . If, on some occa-
sions, the women are permitted to join in the feflival, the cha-
racter of the entertainment is fill the fme, and no movement
or geflure is expressive of attachment, or encourages si-
liarity h.

B v K among the Americans. The fame causes, which so often
h'--v--' prompt persons at their ease in civilized life to have recourse

to this pastime, render it the delight of the savage. The for-
mer are independent of labour, the latter do not feel the ne-
ceffity of it, and as both are unemployed, they run with tran-
sport to whatever is of power to stir and agitate their minds.
Hence the Americans, who at other times are so indifferent,
so phlegmatic, so silent, and so disinterested, as oon as they
engage in play become rapacious, impatient, noisy, and al-
most frantic with eagerness. Their furs, their domeflic uten-
fils, their clothes, their arms, are flaked at the gaming-table,
and when all is loft, high as their sense of independence is, in
a wild emotion of despair or of hope, they will often risk their
personal liberty, upon a single cast'. Among several tribes,
such gaming parties frequently recur, and become their moss
acceptable entertainment at every great festival. Superstition,
which is apt to take hold of those passions which are most vi-
gorous, frequently lends its aid to confirm and strengthen this
favourite inclination. Their conjurers are accustomed to pre-
scribe a solemn match at play, as one of the most efficacious
methods of appeasing their gods, or of reltoring the sick to

health .

and for FROM causes similar to those which render them fond of play,

to have been one of the first exertions of human ingenuity to
discover ome composition of an intoxicating quality; and

part of the New World, thc natives poffefied the art of cxtrac3ing
an intoxicating liquor from maize or the manioc root, the lalme
substances which they convert into bread. The operation by
which they effec this, nearly resembles the common one of
brewing, but with this difference, that in place of yelt, they
use a nauseous infusion of a certain quantity of maize or manioc
chewed by their women. The saliva excites a vigorous ser-
mentation, and in a few days the liquor becomes fit for drink-.
ing. It is not disagreeable to the taste, and when fvallowcd
in large quantities, is of an intoxicating quality". This is the
general beverage of the Americans, which they dilingui by
various names, and for which they feel fuich a violent and in-
satiable desire, as it is not cafy cither to conceive or defcribc.
Among polinlcd nations, where a ilccefion of various funilLions

B o0 0 K frame of the inhabitants does not require the stimulation of

-----' fermented liquors. In colder countries, the constitution of the

natives, more robufi and more sluggish, stands in need of ge-
nerous liquors to quicken and animate it. But among savages,
the desire offomething that is of power to intoxicate, is in
every ituation the fame. All the people of America, if we
except ome finall tribes near the Straits of Magellan, whether
natives of the torrid zone, or inhabitants of its more temperate
regions, or placed by a harder fate in the severe climates to-
wards its northern or southern extremity, appear to be equally
under the dominion of this appetite °. Such a finiilarity of
tafle, among people in fiuch different situations, muti be ascribed
to the influence of some Inoral caufc, and cannot be confidered
as the cffect of any physical or constitutional want. While
engaged in var or in the chafe, the savage is often in the
most inteefling situations, and all the powers of his nature
are rouzed to the most vigorous exertions. But those animating
scenes are succeeded by long intervals of repose, during which
the warrior meets with nothing that he deems of sufficient dig-
nity or importance to merit his attention. He languishes and
mopes in this season of indolence. The posture of his body is
an emblem of the Itate of his mind. In one climate, cowering
over the fire in his cabin; in another, ftrctched under the slade
of some tree; he does away his time in flcep, or in an unthink-
ing jovlcfs inactivity, not far removed from it. As strong li-
quors awake him from this torpid slate, give a brisker motion
to his spirits, and enliven him more thoroughly than either
dancing or gaming, his love of them is exceflive. A avage,
when not engaged in aion, is a pensive melancholy animal;

but as soon as he tafes, or has a profpleq of tailng, the in- B °0 K
toxicating draught, he becomes gay and frolicfomne . What- *--.
ever be the occalion, or pretext, on which the Americans as-
femble, the meeting always terminates in a debauch. Many
of their feflivals have no other objet, and they welcome the
return of them with transports of joy. As tlicy are not accuf-
tomed to restrain any appetite, they let no bounds to this. The
riot often continues without intcrmifiion fcvcral days; and
whatever be the fatal effeas of their excess, they never ceale
from drinking as long as one drop of liquor remains. The
perions of greatell eminence, the most diflinguilhed warriors,
and the chiefs molt renowned for their wildom, have no wnore
command of theinfelves than the molt obscure menmber of the
community. Their eagerncls for prefcnt cnjoyment rcnders
them blind to its fatal conlequences; and tliofe very men, who,
in other situations, seem to possess a force of mind more tlan
human, are in this initance inferior to children in foresight, as
well as consideration, and mere slaves of )brutal appetite .
When their pafions, naturally firong, arc heightened and in-
flamed by drink, they are guilty of tlhe moil enormous out-
rages, and the festivity fcldoni concludes without deeds of vio-
lence, or bloodshed .

BUT, amidlt this wild debauch, there is one circumflince

remarkable; the women, in most of the American tribes, are
not permitted to partake of it'. Their province is to prepare
the liquor, to serve it aout to the gucfis, and to take care of
their husbands and friends, wlen their reason is overpowered.

inferiority, and as an additional evidence of that contempt with
which they were treated in the New World. The people of
North America, when rft discovered, were not acquainted
with any intoxicating drink; but as the Europeans early found
it their interest to fup)ly them with pirituous liquors, drun-
kennefs oon became as universal among them as among their

When their parents and other relations become old, or labour
under any distemper which their slender knowledge of the heal-
ing art cannot remove, they cut fliort their days with a violent
hand, in order to be relieved from the burden of supporting and
tending them. This practice prevailed among the ruder tribes in
every part of the continent, from Hudson's Bay to the river De
la Plata; and however shocking it may be to those sentiments
of tcnderncfs and attachment, which, in civilized life, we are
apt to confider as congenial with our frame, the condition of
man in the savage slate leads and reconciles him to it. The
fame hardflips and difficulty of procuring fubfifitcnce, which

are no less unable than the latter to perform the funaions that ---
belong to a warrior or hunter, or to endure those various dif-
trefles in which savages are so often involved, by their own want
of foresight and induflry. Their relations fecl this; and in-
capable of attending to the wants or weaknesses of others, their
impatience under an additional burden prompts them to ex-
tinguifh that life which they find it difficult to sustain. This is
not regarded as a deed of cruelty, but as an a of mercy. An
American, broken with years and infirmities, conscious that he
can no longer depend on the aid of those around him, places
himself contentedly in his grave; and it is by the hands of his
children or nearest relations that the thong is pulled, or the
blow inflited, which releases him for ever from the sorrows of
life .

lered capable of excrcifing, depend entirely upon the larc of
society in which he is placed. To this flats his mind naturally

feel, and the functions in which these engage him, his intel-
letual powers are called forth. According to the connedions
which it establishes between him and the reft of his species, the
affections of his heart are exerted. It is only by attending to
this great principle, that we can discover what is the character
of man in every different period of his progress.

Intelleaual IF we apply it to savage life, and meafre the attainments of
powers. the human mind in that slate by this standard, we hall find,

according to an observation which I have already made, that
the intellectual powers of man mull be extremely limited in
their operations. They are confined within the narrow sphere
of what le deems necessary for supplying his own wants. What-
ever has not some relation to there, neither attrats his atten-
tion, nor is the object of his inquiries. But however narrow
the bounds may be within which the knowledge of a savage
is circumscribed, he possesses thoroughly that finall portion
which he has attained. It was not communicated to him by
formal inftrution; he does not attend to it as a matter of mere
speculation and curiosity; it is therefult of his own observation,
the fruit of his own experience, and accommodated to his con-
dition and exigencies. While employed in the aive occupa-
tions of war or hunting, lie often finds himself in difficult and
perilous situations, from which the efforts of his own sagacity
must extricate him. IHe is frequently engaged in mcafurcs
where every flep ldepends upon his own ability to decide, where
he must rely solely upon his own penetration to dicern the dan-
gers to which he is cxpofd, and upon his own wilflom in pro-
viding against them.

5 As

As the talents of individuals are exerciscd and improved by B OO K

such exertions, much political wisdom is said to be displaycd in
conducting the affairs of their finall communities. The council al't
of old men in an American tribe, deliberating upon its interefis,
and determining with refpcd to peace or war, has been com-
pared to the senate in more polished republics. The proceed-
ings of the former, we are told, are often no less formal and
sagacious than those of the latter. Great political wisdom is
exhibited in pondering tile various measures proposed, and in
balancing their probable advantages, against the evils of which
they may be producive. Much address and eloquence are em-
ployed by the leaders, who aspire at acquiring Iiclh confidence
with their countrymen, as to have an ascendant in thoft assem-
blies . But, among savage tribes, the field for displaying po-
litical talents cannot be extensive. Where tle idea of private
property is unknown, and no criminaljurifdideion is elabliflled,
there is hardly any funcion of internal government to exercise.
Where there is no commerce, and scarcely any intercourse
among separate tribes; where enmity is implacable, and hofli-
lities are carried on almost without intermiflion; there will be
few points of public concern to adjust with their neighbours;
and that department of their affairs which may be denominated
foreign, cannot be so intricate as to require any refined policy
in conducling it. Where individuals are lo tloughtlefs and
improvident as seldom to take effcQdual precautions for self-
prcfervation, it is vain to expect that public mcafircs and de-
liberations will be regulated by the contemplation of remote
events. It is the genius of lfvages to a fi-om tlhe illfc of
present paflion. They have neither frcfight nor tcmper to

frequent, and their negociations are so many Y, and so long:
protracted, as to give their proceedings an extraordinary asped.
of wisdom. But this is not owing so much to the depth of
their schemes, as. to the coldness and phlegm of their temper,
which render them flow in determining . If we except the,
celebrated. league, that united the Five Nations in Canada into
a federal republic, which shall be confidered in its proper place,
we can discern few such traces of political wisdom, among the
rude American tribes, as discover, any great degree of foresight'
or extent of intelleCual abilities.. Even among them, we flall.
find public measures more frequently directed by the impetuous
ferocity of their youth, than. regulated by the experience and:
wisdom of their old men,

to the progress of the understanding, it has a tendency like-
wife, in ome refpeds, to check the exercise of affeCion, and
to render the heart contracted. The itrongeft feeling in the
mind, of a savage is a sense of his own independence. He has
sacrificed so small a portion of his natural liberty by becoming
a member of society, that he remains, in a. great degree, the
sole mafler of his own aions . He often takes his refolu-
tions alone, without consulting, or feeling any connection
with the pcrfons around him. In many of his operations, he
tlands as much detached from the reft of his species, as if he had
formed no union with them. Conscious how little he depends
upon other men, he is apt to view them with a careless indif-

this unconcern, and as he looks not beyond himself in dcliberat- -
ing with refped to the part which lie should a, his folici-
tude about the consequences of it seldom extends farther. IIs
pursues his own career, and indulges his own fancy, without
inquiring or regarding whether what he does be agreeable or
offensive to others, whether they may derive benefit, or receive
hurt from it. Hence the ungovernable caprice of fvagcs,
their impatience under any fpccies of reflraint, their inability
to suppress or moderate any inclination, the scorn or nc glc
with which they receive advice, their high cflimation of thcemi
selves, and their contempt of other men. Among thec, the
pride of independence produces almost the fame effecs with
intereftednefs in a more advanced state of society, it refers every
thing to a man himself, and renders the gratification of his
own wishes, the measure and end of conduct.

To he fame cause may be imputed the hardness of heart, IdiIcCr~ ofr

and insensibility, remarkable in all savage nations. Their rt
minds, rouzed only by firong emotions, are little fufccptible
of gentle, delicate, or tender affeaions . Their union is
incomplete, that each individual ads as if he retained all his
natural rights entire and undiminifled. If a favour is conferred
upon him, or any beneficial fervicc is performed on his account,
he receives it with much fatisfaFtion, becaure it contributes to his
enjoyment; but this sentiment extends not beyond hinlclf, it
excites no sense of obligation, he neither feels gratituCde, nor

children. Its effecs are no less conspicuous, in the perform-
ance of those mutual offices of tenderness which the infirmities
of our nature fiequently exa. Among some tribes, when any
of their number are seized with a diflemper, they are generally
abandoned by all around them, who, careless of their reco-
very, fly in the utmost consternation from the supposed dan-
ger of infection . But even where they are not thus deserted,
the cold indifference with which they are attended can afford
them little consolation. No look of sympathy, no soothing ex-
pressions, no officious services contribute to alleviate or to make
them forget their sufferings '. Their nearest relations will
often refuse to submit to the finalleft inconveniency, or to
part with the least trifle, however much it may tend to
their accommodation or relief". So little is the brcaft of a
savage fuiceptible of those sentiments which prompt men to
that feeling attention which mitigates diflrefs, that, in some
provinces of America, the Spaniards have foiund it iiecclLiryl to

The fame harshness of temper is frill more conspicuous in their
treatment of the animal creation. Prior to their intercourse
with the people of Europe, the North-Americans had obne
tame dogs, which accompanied them in their hunting excur-
sions, and served them with all the ardour and fidelity pecu-
liar to the species. But, inltead of that fond attachment, whicl
the hunter naturally feels towards those useful companions of
his toils, they requite their services with nglec, fcldom feed,
and never caress them . In other provinces, the Americans
have become acquainted with tle domestic animals of Europe,
and avail themselves of their service; but it is univcrfally ob-
served that they always treat them harshly , and never employ
any method either for breaking or managing them, but force
and cruelty. In every part of the deportment of man in hi%
savage state, whether towards his equals of the human species,
or towards the animals below him, we recognize the fame cha-
raCter, and trace the operations of a mind, intent on its own
gratifications, and regulated by its own caprice, with little
attention or sensibility to the sentiments and feelings of tile
beings around him.

-----' by circumstances apparently trivial, than by those of greater

moment. A savage, frequently placed in situations of danger
and distress, depending on himself alone, and wrapt up in his
own thoughts and fohemes, is a serious melancholy animal.
His attention to others is small. The range of his own ideas
is narrow. Hence that taciturnity which is so difgufling to
men accustomed to the open intercourse of social conversation.
When not engaged in aion, the Americans often fit whole
days in one posture, without opening their lips'. When they
go forth to war, or to the chace, they usually march in a line
at some dirtance from one another, and without exchanging a
word. The fame profound silence is observed when they row
together in a canoe m. It is only when they are animated by
intoxicating liquors, or rouzed by the jollity of the festival and
dance, that they become gay and converfible.
Cunning. To the fame causes may be imputed the refined cunning with

wvhich they form and execute their schemes. Men, who are
not habituated to a liberal communication of their own senti-
ments and withes, are apt to be so difirultful, as to place little
confidence in others., and to have recourse to an insidious craft,
in accomplilhing their own purposes. In civilized life, those
pcrfons, who, by their ituation, have but a few objects ofpur-
foit on whlich their minds incefantly dwell, are most remark-
ablc for low artifice in carrying on their little projeas. Among
favagcs, wlofe views are equally confined, and their attention
no less perfcvering, thoe circumflances mufl operate flill more
plowerfully, and gradually accufloin them to a disingenuous

by habits which they acquire in carrying on the two moil
interesting operations wherein they are engaged. With them
war is a system of craft, in which they trull for success to itra-
tagem more than to open force, and have their invention con-
tinually on the firetch to circumvent and furprile their enemies.
As hunters, it is their constant olbjct to enfhare, in order that
they may destroy. Accordingly, art and cunning have been
universally observcd as diftinguilhing charaferillics of all
savages. The people of the rude tribes of America are re-
markable for their address and duplicity. Impenetrably ecret
in forming their measures, they pursue them with a patienc
undeviating attention, and there is no refinement of diflimula-
tion which they cannot employ, in order to insure fucccfs. The
natives of Peru were engaged above thirty years, in concerting
the plan of their infurreaion, under the vice-royalty of the
marquis de Villa-Garcia; and though communicated to a great
number of all different ranks, no indication of it ever tran-
spired during that long period; no man betrayed his trufr, or
by an unguarded look, or rash word, gave rife to any fufpi-
cion of what was intended". The dissimulation and craft of
individuals is no less remarkable than that of nations. When
set upon deceiving, they wrap themfclves up so artificially,
that it is impoflible to penetrate into their intentions, or to de-
test their designs °.

pendence, which is the pride of a savage, and which he con-
fiders as the unalienable prerogative of man. Incapable of
controul, and disdaining to acknowledge any superior, his
mind, though limited in its powers, and erring in many of its
pursuits, acquires such elevation by the consciousness of its own
fieedom, that he ads on ome occasions with afionifhing force,
and perseverance, and dignity.
Fortitude. As independence nourishes this high spirit among savages,

the perpetual wars in which they are engaged call it forth into
action. Such long intervals of tranquillity as are frequent in
polished societies, are unknown in the savage slate. Their en-
mities, as" I have observed, are implacable and immortal. The
valour of the youth is never allowed to rust in inaion. The
hatchet is always in their hand, either for attack or defence.
Even in their hunting excursions, they must be on their guard
against surprise from the hostile tribes, by which they are
surrounded. Accustomed to continual alarms, they grow fa-
miliar with danger; courage becomes an habitual virtue, result-
ing naturally from their situation, and itrengthened by con-
ftant exertions. The mode of displaying fortitude may not be
the fame in small and rude communities, as in more powerful
and civilized flates. Their fyflem of war, and standard of
valour may be formed upon different principles, but in no
situation does the human mind rife more superior to the sense
of danger, or the dread of death, than in its most simple and
uncultivated slate.

to the community of which they are members. From the na- --

ture of their political union, one might expet this tie to be toteil,, r,,^
extremely feeble. But there are circumstances which render llu"":y.
the influence, even of their loose mode of aflbciation, very
powerful. The American tribes are small; combined against
their neighbours, in prosecution of ancient enmities, or in
avenging recent injuries, their interefis and operations are
neither numerous nor complex. These are obje:s, wlhich
the uncultivated understanding of a savage can comprehend.
His heart is capable of forming connedions, which are so little
dliffufed. Ie aflents with warmth to public incaures, dicqated
by passions, similar to thofc which influence his own conduc2.
Hence the ardour with which individuals undertake the molt
perilous service, when the community deems it neccfTary.
Hence their fierce and deep-rooted antipathy to the public ene-
mies. Hence their zeal for the honour of their tribe, and that
love of their country, which prompts them to brave danger that
it may triumph, and to endure the moll exquilite torments
without a groan, that it may not be disgraced.

may be condemned to relide in one place, and to be nourished
with the top of a weed. The rude Americans, fond of their
own pursuits, and satisfied with their own lot, are equally un-
able to comprehend the intention or utility of the various ac-
commodations, which, in more polished society, are deemed
essential to the comfort of life. Far from complaining of their
own situation, or viewing that of men in a more improved
state with admiration or envy, they regard themselves as the
standard of excellence, as beings the best entitled, as well
as the most perfectly qualified, to enjoy real happiness. Un-
accustomed to any restraint upon their will or their actions,
they behold with amazement the inequality of rank, and the
filbordination which take place in civilized life, and confider
the voluntary submission of one man to another, as a renunci-
ation, no less base than unaccountable, of the first diftindion
of humanity. Void of foresight, as well as free from care
themselves, and delighted with that state of indolent security,
they wonder at the anxious precautions, the unceasing industry,
and complicated arrangements of Europeans, in guarding against
diflant evils, or providing for future wants, and exclaim against
their prepofierous folly, in thus multiplying the troubles,
and increasing the labour of life . This preference of their
own manners is conspicuous on every occasion. Even the
names, by which the various nations wish to be distinguished,
are assumed from this idea of their own pre-eminence. The
appellation which the Iroquois give to themselves is, the chief

of the windward islands, signifies the warlike people'. The B OO K
Cherokee, from an idea of their own fpcriority, call the '--
Europeans Nothitns, or the accurfd race, and afuime to them-
selves the name of The beloved people'. The fame principle
regulated the notions of the other Americans concerning the iuro-
peans; for although, at first, they were tilled with anionitlllenzt at
their arts, and with dread of their pow er, they oon came to abate
their etlimation of men, whose maxims of life were fb diffcrent
from their own. Hence they called them the fioth of the fca,
men without father or mother. They supposed, that either
they had no country of their own, and therefore invaded that
which belonged to others'; or, that, being defitute of the nc-
ceffaries of life at home, they were obliged to roam over tle
ocean, in order to rob such as were more amply provided.

MEN, thus satisfied with their condition, are far from any in-

clination to rclinquifh their own habits, or to adopt those of ci-
vilized live. The transition is too violent to be suddenly made.
Even where endeavours have been used to wean a avage from
his own cufloms, and to render the accommodations of polished
society familiar to him; even where he has been allowed to tafl
of those pleasures, and has been honoured with those diflinClions,
which are the chief objes of our defirc, he droops and lan-
guifhes under the rcftraint of laws and forms, he fcizcs the firfl
opportunity of breaking loose from them, and returns with
transport to the forest or the wild, where lie can enjoy a care-
less and uncontrotiled freedom'.

B 0 o K Tius I have finifled a laborious delineation of the character

Iv.

-t _-i
-- and manners of the uncivilized tribes scattered over the vas:

continent of America. In this, I aspire not at rivalling the
great masers who have painted and adorned savage life, either
in boldness of design, or in the glow and beauty of their co-
louring. I am satisfied with the more humble merit of having
perfifled with patient industry, in viewing my subjet in many
various lights, and in collecing from the most accurate ob-
servers such detached and often minute features, as might.
enable me to exhibit a portrait that refeinbles the original.

(eneral cau- BEFORE I close this part of my work, one observation more
tion with re-
fp: to this is neceflary, in order to justify the conclusions which I ave
inquiry. formed, or to prevent the miflakes into which such as examine

them may fall. In contemplating the inhabitants of a country
so widely extended as America, great attention hould be paid
to the diversity of climates under which they are placed. The
influence of this I have pointed out with refpeE to several im-
portant particulars, which have been the object of research;
but even where it has not been mentioned, it ought not to be
overlooked. The provinces of America are of such different
temperament, that this alone is sufficient to constitute a dif-
tinaion between their inhabitants. In every part of the earth
where man exifs, the power of climate operates, with decisive
influence, upon his condition and characer. In those coun-
tries which approach near to the extremes of heat or cold, this
influence is so conspicuous as to flrike every eye. Whether
we conidcr man merely as an animal, or as a being endowed
with rational powers which fit him for activity and fpecula-
tion, we fliall find that he has uniformly attained the greatest

3 perfection

perfection of which his nature is capable, in the temperate B o , K
regions of the globe. There his conflitution is most vigorous, --
his organs mofi acute, and his form most beautiful. There,
too, he poTeffes a superior extent or capacity, greater fertility
of imagination, more enterprising courage, and a sensibility of
heart which gives birth to palions, not only ardent, but per-
fevering. In this favourite ituation he has displayed the utmost
efforts of his genius, in literature, in policy, in commerce, in.
war, and in all the arts which improve or embellish life .

THrs powerful operation of climate is felt nmot sensibly by rude

nations, and produces greater effess than in societies more highly
polilhed. The talents of civilized men are continually exerted
in rendering their condition more comfortable; and by their
ingenuity and inventions, they can, in a great mcafurc, supply
the defects, and guard against the inconveniences, of any cli-
mate. But the improvident savage is affeaed by every circum-
fiance peculiar to his situation. He takes no precaution either
to mitigate or to improve it. Like a plant, or an animal, he
is formed by the climate under which he is placed, and feels the
full force of its influence.

IN surveying the rude nations of America, this natural iif-

'tinaion between the inhabitants of the temperate and torrid
zones is very remarkable. They may, accordingly, be divided
into two great clafies. The one comprehends all the Nortlh-
Americans, from the river St. Laurence to the Gulf of Mexico,

B 0oo I together with the people of Chili, and a few fall tribes to-
-y wards the extremity of the bouthern continent. To the other

belong all the inhabitants of the islands, and those fettled in the
various provinces which extend from the isthmus of Darien
alinof to the southern confines of Brasil, along the east fide of
the Andes. In the former, the human species appears mani-
feftly to be more perfec. The natives are more robust, more
active, more intelligent, and more courageous. They possess,
in the moll eminent degree, that force of mind, and love of
independence, which I have pointed out as the chief virtues of
man in his savage state. They have defended their liberty with
pelfevering fortitude againit the Europeans, who subdued the
other rude nations of America with the greatest ease. The
nativcs of the temperate zone are the only people in the New
\Vorld who are indebted for their freedom to their own valour.
The North-Americans, though long encompassed by three formid-
able European powers, fill retain part of their original posses-
sions, and continue to exist as independent nations. The people
of Chili, though early invaded, till maintain a gallant contest
with the Spaniards, and have set bounds to their encroach-
ments; whereas, in the warmer regions, men are more feeble
in their frame, less vigorous in the efforts of their mind, of a
gentle but dastardly spirit, more enslaved by pleasure and funk
in indolence. Accordingly, it is in the torrid zone that the Eu-
ropeans have molt completely eabliflled their dominion over
America; the molt fertile and desirable provinces in it are sub-
jeced to their yoke; and if several tribes there fiill enjoy in-
dependence, it is either because they have never been attacked
by an enemy already satiated with conquest, and polffeled of
larger territories than lie was able to occupy, or becaufc they

have

have been saved from oppression by their remote and inaccessible B 0 k
situation.

CONSPICUOUS as this diflindion may appear between the

inhabitants of those different regions, it is not, however, uni-
versal. Moral and political caufcs, as I have formerly obferv-
ed, affect the disposition and charader of individuals as well a3
nations, still more powerfully than the influence of climate.
There are, accordingly, some tribes, in various parts of the tor-
rid zone, possessed of courage, high spirit, and the love of inde-
pendence, in a degree hardly inferior to the natives of more
temperate climates. We are too little acquainted with the
history of those people, to be able to trace the fevcral cir-
cumflances in their progress and situation, to which they
are indebted for this remarkable pre-eminence. The fat-,
nevertheless, is certain. As early as the first voyage of Co-
lumbus, he received information that several of the islands were
inhabited by the Cllibbees, a fierce race of nmen, nowiec rcfecm-
bling their feeble and timid neighbours. In his second expe-
dition to the New World, lie found this information to be jult,
and was litnfelf a witncfs of their intrepid valour . The fhinc
charatcer they have maintained invariably in all fi)bfeiliiei
contefis with the people of our continent Y; and, even in our
own timles, we have en them make a gallant fland in defe(nrc
of the last territory which the r;lacity of the Eurolpeans had
left in their poffeflon '. Somne nations in Bralil were Ino (Icf

the human species, cannot be applied, in judging of their con-
dua, without many exceptions.

T Y R E was situated at such a distance from the Arabian Gulf or

Red Sea, as made it impracticable to convey commodities from

thence to that city by land-carriage. This induced the Phenicians to
render themselves masters of Rhinocrura, or Rhinocolura, the nearest
port in the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. They landed the cargoes
which they purchased in Arabia, Ethiopia, and India, at Elath, the
safest harbour in the Red Sea towards the north. Thence they were
carried by land to Rhinocolura, the distance not being very considerable;
and being refhipped in that port, were transported to Tyre, and diftri-

THE Periplus Hannonis is the only authentic monument of the Car-

me appear unanswerable. Ramufio has accompanied his translation
of this curious voyage with a dissertation tending to illufRrate it.

great learning and ability, treated the fame subjes. It pears

days. This is probably what is known to the moderns by the name
of the Isle of Arguim. It jbcanie the chief station of the Carthagi-
nians on that coast; and M. de Bougainville contends, that the cif-
terns found there are monuments of the Carthaginian power and in-
genuity. Proceeding from Cerne, and still following the winding of
the coast, he. arrived, in seventeen days, at a promontory which he
called he Weftt Horn, probably Cape Palmas. From this he ad-
vanced to another promontory, which he named The South Horn, and
which is manifestly Cape de Tres Puntas, about five degrees north of
the line. All the circumstances contained in the short abftrat 'of his
journal, which is handed down to us, concerning the appearance and
fcate of the countries on the coast of Africa, are confirmed and
illufirated by a comparilon with the accounts of modern navigators.

a profound silence reigned through the day; but during the night,
innumerable fires were kindled long the banks of the rivers, and
the air refbunded with the noiCe of pipes and drums, and cries of

their houfts, durin'g the day. As oon as the fun sets, they sally out,

" as the fun dipped beneath the horizon, and night ovcrfpread the
earth with darkness, the sea lent us its friendly light. While the prow
of our vessel ploughed the foaming surges, it seemed to set them
all on fire. Thus we failed in a luminous inclofure, which surrounded
us like a large circle of rays, from whence darted in the wake of the

L ONG after the navigation of the Phenicians and of Eudoxus round

Africa, Polybius, the most intelligent and belt informed historian of

antiquity, affirms, that it was not known, in his time, whether Africa
was a continued continent, stretching to the south, or whether it was
encompassed by the sea. Polybii Hist. lib. iii. Pliny the naturalist aflerts,
that there can be no communication between the southern and northern
temperate zones. PliniiHilt. Natur. Edit. in ufum Delph. 4to. lib. ii. c. 68.
If they had given full credit to the accounts of those voyages, the former
could not have entertained such a doubt, the latter could not have
delivered such an opinion. Strabo mentions the voyage of Eudoxus,
but treats it as a fabulous tale, lib. ii. p. 155.; and, according to his
account, no other judgment can be formed with relpect to it. Strabc
seems not to have known any thing with certainty concerning the form
and state of the southern parts of Africa. Geogr. lib. xvii. p. i l o.
Ptolemy, the molt inquisitive and learned of all the ancient geogra-
phers, was equally unacquainted with any part of Afiica situate a
few degrees beyond the equinocial line; for he fuplpofes that this
great continent was not surrounded by the sea, but that it flretclid,
without interruption, towards the south pole: and he f far mistakes
its true figure, that he describes the continent as becoming broader
and broader as it advanced towards the outh. Ptolomxi Geogr.

A FACT, recorded by Strabo, affords a very frong and fingularproof

of the ignorance of the ancients with refped to the situation of

the various parts of the earth. When Alexander marched along the
banks of the Hydafpes and Acefine, two of the rivers which fall into
the Indus, he observed that there were many crocodiles in those rivers,
and that the country produced beans of the fame species with those
which were common in Egypt. From there circumstances, he con-
cluded that he had discovered the source of the Nile, and prepared a
fleet to fail down the Hydafpes to Egypt. Strab. Geogr. lib. xv.
p. 1020. This amazing error did not arise from any ignorance of
geography peculiar to that monarch; for we are informed by Strabo,
that Alexander applied with particular attention in order to acquire
the knowledge of this science, and had accurate maps or descriptions of
the countries through which he marched. Lib. ii. p. 2zo. But, in
his age, the knowledge of the Greeks did not extend beyond the limits
of the Mediterranean,

I T is probable that the ancients were fcldom induced to advance Tso

far, either by motives of curiosity, or views of commercial advan-

tage. In consequence of this, their idea concerning the position of
that great river was very erroneous. Ptolemy places that branch of
the Ganges which he diftinguifles by the name of the Great Moutrh
in the hundred and forty-fixth degree of longitude from his first me-
ridian in the Fortunate Islands. But its true longitude, computed

from that meridian, is now determined by aronomical observations
to be only a hundred and five degrees. A geographer fb eminent
must have been betrayed into an error of this magnitude by the imper-
fetion of the information which he had received concerning those
distant regions; and this affords a striking proof of the intercourse
with them being extremely rare. With respect to the countries of

IT is remarkable, that the discoveries of the ancients were made chiefly

by land; those of the moderns are carried on chiefly by ea. The

progress of conquefr led to the former, that of commerce to the latter.
It is a judicious observation of Strabo, that the conquests of Alexander
the Great made known the Eafl, those of the Romans opened the Wefs,

great measure unknown. The ancients, who had a very imperfece
knowledge of its coasts, except where they are wafled by the Medi-
terranean or Red Sea, were accustomed to penetrate into its inland
provinces, and, if we may rely on the teltimony of Herodotus and
Diodorus Siculus, had explored many parts of it now altogether un-
known. Unless both modes of discovery be united, the geographical
knowledge of the earth must remain incomplete and inaccurate.

T' H E notion of the ancients concerning such an excessive degree of

heat in the torrid zone, as rendered it uninhabitable, and their

persisting in this error long after they began to have rome commercial
intercourse with several parts of India lying within the tropics, must
appear so singular and absurd, that it may not be unacceptable to ome
of my readers to produce evidence of their holding this opinion, and
to account-for the apparent inconsistence of their theory with their
experience. Cicero, who had bestowed attention upon every part of
philosophy known to the ancients, seems to have believed that the
torrid zone was uninhabitable, and, of consequence, that there could
be no intercourse between the northern and southern temperate zones.
H1e introduces Africanus thus addressing the younger Scipio: You
fee this earth encompalfed, and as it were bound in by certain zones,
ofwhich, two, at the greatest distance from each other, and sustaining
the opposite poles of heaven, are frozen with perpetual cold; the
middle one, and the largest of all, is burnt with the heat of the fun;
two are habitable, the people in the southern one are antipodes to us,
with whom we have no conne&ion." Somnium Scipionis, c. 6. Geminus,
a Greek philosopher, contemporary with Cicero, delivers the fame
LlodLrine, not in a popular work, but in his Erayyn T E i IPuo,u a
treatii purely fcientilic. " When we Ipeak," lays he, " of the
tbutlicrn temperate zone, and its inhabitants, and concerning those who
are called antipodes, it mull be always underllood, that we have no cer-
iain knowledge or information concerning the southern temperate zone,

whethcr

*whether it be inhabited or not. But from the spherical figure of the
earth, and the course which the fun holds between the tropic, we
conclude that there is another zone, situated to the south, which en-
joys the fame degree of temperature with the northern one which we
inhabit." Cap. xiii. p. 3. ap. Petavii Opus de Dotr. Tempor. in
quo Uranologium five Syflemata var. Aucorum. Amift. 1705.
vol. iii. The opinion of Pliny the naturalilt, with relpect to both
these points, was the fame: " There are five divilions of the earth,
which are called zones. All that portion which lies near to the two
opposite poles is opprefied with vehement cold, and eternal frost.
There, unblest with the aect of nilder itars, perpetual darkness
reigns, or at the utmofi a e-eble lilit reflced from Uirrounding
hnows. The middle of the earth, in whiih is the orbit of the lin, is
scorched and burnt up with sPames and fiery vapour. Between there
torrid and frozen difiricts lie two other portions of the earth, which
are temperate; but, on account of the burning region interpoled,
there can be no communication between them. Thus Heaven has
deprived us of three parts of the earth." Lib. ii. c. 68. Strabo de-
livers his opinion to the fame etcf , in terms no lels explicit: " The
portion of the earth which lies near the equator, in the torrid zone,
is rendered uninhabitable by heat." Lib. ii. p. 154. To there 1
might add the authority of many other relpectable piilofophers and
historians of antiquity.

IN order to explain the fcnlf in which this docriine was generally

received, we may observe, that Parmenides, as we are informed by
Strabo, was the first who divided the earth into five zones, and lhe ex-
tended the limits of the zone, which he supposed to be uninhabitable
on account of heat, beyond the tropics. Ariflotle, as we learn like-
wile from Strabo, fixed the boundaries of the diflfeent zones in the
fame m1annc r as they are (lillne by modern geographers. Bu t the

scribe the limits of the torrid zone. It is not easy to ascertain with
precilion the boundaries which they allotted to it. From a passage in
Strabo, who, as far as I kno\., is the only author of antiquity from
whom we receive any hint concerning this fubjcci, I flould conjecture,
that those who calci lted according to the mneafurcment of the earth
by Eratofihenes, fuppoled the torrid zone to comprehend near sixteen
degrees, about eight on each fide of the equator; whereas such as
followed the computation of Pofidonius allotted about twenty-four
degrees, or somewhat more than twelve degrees on each fide of the
equator to the torrid zone. Strabo, lib. ii. p. 5.. According to
the former opinion, about two thirds of that portion of the earth which
lies between the tropics was confidered as habitable; according to the
latter, about one half of it. With this reftriclion, the doarine of the
ancients concerning the torrid zone appears less absurd; and we can
conceive the reason of their asserting this zone to be uninhabitable,
even after they had opened a communication with several places within
the tropics. When men of science spoke of the torrid zone, they confi-
dered it as it was limited by the definition of geographers to sixteen,
or at the utmost to twenty-four degrees; and as they knew almost
nothing of the countries nearer to the equator, they might fill suppose
them to be uninhabitable. In loose and popular discourse, the
name of the torrid zone continued to be given to all that portion of
the earth which lies within the tropics. Cicero seems to have been
unacquainted with those ideas of the later geographers, and adhering
to the division of Parmenides, describes the torrid zone as the largef:
of the five. Some of the ancients reje&ed the notion concerning the
intolerable heat of the torrid zone as a popular error. This, we are
told by Plutarch, was the sentiment of Pythagoras, and we learn fiom
Strabo, that Eratosthenes and Polybius had adopted the fame opinion,
lib. ii. 154. Ptolemy seems to have paid no regard to the ancient
doctrine and opinions concerning the torrid zone.

John II. of Portugal dispatched ambassadors to Edward IV., in order
to lay before him the right which he had acquirei by the 'ope's bull

subjects to prosecute their intended voyage. Edward was so much

T H.E spherical figure of the earth was known to the ancient geo-

graphers. They invented the method, still in use, of computing tne

longitude and latitude of different places. According to their doc-
trine, the equator or imaginary line which encompasses the earth con-
tained three hundred and sixty degrees; these they divided into twenty-
four parts, or hours, each equal to fifteen degrees. The country of
the Seres or Sine, being the farthest part of India known to the ancients,
was fuppoled, by Marinus Tyrius, the most eminent of the ancient
geographers before Ptolemy, to be fifteen hours, or two hundred
and twenty-five degrees to the east of the sirs} meridian, palsing through
the Fortunate Islands. tolomari Geogr. lib. i. c. i i. If this fuppo-
fition was well-founded, the country of the Seres, or China, was
only nine hours, or one hundred and thirty-five degrees weft from the
Fortunate, o Canary Islands; and the navigation, in that direction,
was much shorter than by the course which the Portuguese were pur-
suing. Marco Polo, in his travels, had described countries, particu-
larly the ifand of Cipango or Zipangri, supposed to be Japan, con-
fiderably to the east of any part of Asia, known to the ancients. Marcus
Paulus de Region. Oriental. lib. ii. c. 70. lib. iii. c. 2. Ofcourfe, this
country, as it extended further to the east, was still nearer to the Canary
ifnands. The conclusions of Columbus, though drawn from inaccurate
obfirvations, were jus. If the ituppofitions of Murinus had been well
founded, and if the countries, which Marco Polo visited, had been
situated to the east of those whole longitude Marinus had ascertained,
the proper and nearefl course to the East Indies must have been to
llecr directly weft. Herrera, dec. . lib. i. c. 2. A more exten-
five knowledge of the globe has now difovered the great error of
Marinus, in supposing China to be fifteen hours, or two hundred
and twenty-five degrees ealt fiom the Canary Islands, andl that even
Ptolemy was mifaken, when he reduced the Iinogitude of China to
twelve hours, or one hundred and eighty degrees. Th'le longitude of

ftruclors and guides of mankind in the science of geography.

AS the Portuguese, in making their discoverics, did not depart far

from the coaf of Africa, they concluded that birds, whlofe flight

they observed with great attention, did not venture to any considerable

that birds often flretch their flight to an immncnia diflance fi-om any
flore. In failing towards tie Weft Indian illinds, birds are often

T H E account which Columbus gives of the humanity and orderly

behaviour of the natives on this occasion is very triking. " The

king (fays he, in a letter to Ferdinand and Isabella) having been in-
formed of our misfortune, exprefled great grief for our loss, and
immediately font aboard all the people in the place in many large
canoes; we oon unloaded the Ihip of every thing that was upon deck,
as the king gave us great affiflance, he himself, with his brothers and
relations, took all possible care, that every thing should be properly
done both aboard and on flore. And, from time to time, he ent
oIme of his relations weeping, to beg of me not to be dejected, for he
would give me all that he had. I can affule your highnesses, that there
would not have been so much care taken in securing our effecs in any
part of Spain, as all our property was put together in one place near
his palace, until the houfcs which he wanted to prepare for the custody
of it, were emptied. I-le immediately placed a guard of armed men,
who watched during the whole night, and those on shore limented as if
they had been much interellcd in our loss. The people are so assec-
tionate, so tractable, and so peaceable, that I swear to )our highnesses,
that there is not a better race of men, nor a better country in the world.
They love their neighour as themlrlves; their converltaion is the
fwectefl and ilcdelt in the worli, cheerful, and always accompanied
with a file. And although it is true that they go naked, yet your

cutoms; the king is served with great state, and his behaviour is so
decent, that it is pleasant to fee him, as it is likewise to observe the
wonderful memory which there people have, and their desire of know-
ing every thing, which leads them to inquire into its causes and effets.

V E RY monument of such a man as Columbus is valuable. A
letter whichl he wrote to Ferdinand and Isabella, describing what

pafled on this occasion, exhibits a molt friking picture of his intre-
pidity, his humanity, his prudence, his public fpirir, and courtly
addres. " I would have been leSs concerned for this misfortune,
had I alone been in danger, both because my life is a debt that I owe
to the Supreme Creator, and because I have at other times been ex-
posed to the moit imminent hazard. But what gave me infinite
grief and vexation was, that after it had pleased our Lord to give
me faith to undertake this enterprize, in which I had now been so
successful, that my opponent would have been convinced, and the
glory of your highnefles, and the extent of your territory increased
by mee; it f(ould please the Divine Majefly to flop all by my
death. All this would have been more tolerable, had it not been
attended with the loss of those men whom 1 had carried with me,
upon promise of the greatest prosperity, who feeing thlemfclves in
such diftrcs, cursed not only their coming along with me, but that
fear and awe for me, which prevented them from returning as they
often had resolved to have done. But betides all this, my sorrow was
greatly increased, by recollecting that I had left my two sons at
-chool at Cordova, destitute of friends, in a foreign country, wlien
it could not in all probability be known that I had done luch services
as might induce your highncffes to remember them. And though I
comforted myeilf with the faith, that our Lord would not permit that,

which tended so much to the glory of his church, and which I had
brought about with so much trouble, to remain imperfetl, yet I con-
fidered that, on account of my fins, it was his will to deprive me
of that glory, which I might have attained in this world. While in
this confused state, I thought on the good fortune which accompanies
your highnesses, and imagined, that although I should perifl, and
the vefiel be loft, it was possible that you might somehow come to
the knowledge of my voyage, and the success with which it was at-
tended. For that reason I wrote upon parchment with the brevity
which the situation required, that I had discovered the lands which
I promised, in how many days I had done it, and what course I had
followed. I mentioned the goodness of the country, the character of
the inhabitants, and that your highnesses subjects were left in pof-
session of all that I had discovered. Having fealed this writing, I
addressed it to your highnesses, and promised a thousand ducats to
any person who should deliver it fealed, so that if any foreigners
found it, the promised reward might prevail on them not to give
the information to another. I then caused a great cask to be brought
to me, and wrapping up the parchment in an oiled cloth, and afterwards
in a cake of wax, I put it into the calk, and having flopt it well, I
daft it into the sea. All the men believed that it was some as of de-
votion. Imagining that this might never chance to be taken up, as
the ships approached nearer to Spain, I made another packet like the
firfi, and placed it at the top of the poop, so that if the ship funk,
the calk remaining above water might be committed to the guidance
of iortune."

NOTE XVII. p. lo.
S OM E Spanish authors, with the meanness of national jealouy,

have endeavoured to detra& from the glory of Columbus, by ;n-

linuating that he was led to the discovery of the New World, not by
his own inventive, or enterprising genius, but by information which
he had received. According to their account, a vessel having been

driven

driven from its course by easterly winds, was carried before them far
to the weft, and landed on the coafltof arr unknown country, from
which it returned with difficulty; the pilot, and three ailors, being
the only persons who survived the distresses which the crew suffered,
from want of provisions and fatigue in this long voyage. In a few
days after their arrival, all the four died, but the pilot having been
received into the house of Columbus, his intimate friend, disclosed
to him, before his death, the secret of the discovery which he had
accidentally made, and left him his papers containing a journal of the
voyage, which served as a guide to Columbus in his undertaking.
Gomara, as far as I know, is the first author who publilhed this story,
Hi.t, c. 13. Every circumstance is destitute of evidence to support
it. Neither the name of the vessel nor its destination is known.
Some pretend that it belonged to one of the sea-port towns in Anda-
lifia, and was failing either to the Canaries, or to Madeira; others,
that it was a Bifcayner in its way to England; others, a Portuguese
ship trading on the coast of Guinea. The name of the pilot is alike
unknown, as well as that of the port in which he landed on his return.
According to some, it was in Portugal; according to others, in Ma-
deira, or the Azores. The year in which this voyage was made is no
less uncertain. Monfon's Nav. Trats. Churchill, iii. 371. No
mention is made of this pilot, or his dilicoveries, by And. Bernaldes;
or Pet. Martyr, the contemporaries of Columbus. Herrera, with his
usual judgment, palses over it in silence. Oviedo takes notice of this
report, but confiders it as a tale fit only to amue the vulgar. I-lift.

naries, and never varied ir, rome later authors have supposed, that this
uniformity is a proof of his being guided by ome previous iniorma-
tion. But they do not recollect the principles on which lie founded all
his hopes of success, that by holding a weflerly course, lie nuill cer-
tainly arrive at those regions of the cait described by the ancients.
His firm belief of his own system led him to take that course, and to
pursue it without deviation.

THE Spaniards are not the only people who have called in question

Columbus's claim to the honour of having discovcred America.
Some German authors ascribe this honour to Martin Behaim, their
countryman. He was of the noble family of the Behaims of Schwartz.
bach, citizens of the first rank in the Imperial town of Nuremberg,
Having fludied under the celebrated John Muller, better known by
the name of Regiomontanus, he acquired such knowledge of cofno.
graphy, as prompted him to explore those regions, the situation and
qualities of which he had been accustomed to investigate and describe,
Under the patronage of the Dutchess of Burgundy he repaired to
Lisbon, whither the fame of the Portuguese discoveries invited all the
adventurous spirits of the age. There, as we learn from Herman
Schedel, of whose Chronicon Mundi a German translation was printed
at Nuremberg, A. D. 1493, his merit as a Cosmographer raised him,
in conjunction with Diego Cano, to the command of a squadron fitted
out for discovery in the year 1483. In that voyage, he is said to have
discovered the.kingdom of Congo. He fettled in the island of Fayal,
one of the Azores, and was a particular friend of Columbus. Her-
rera, dec. . lib. i. c. 2. Magellan had a terrestrial globe made by
Behaim, on which he demonrlrated the course that he purposed to
hold in search of the communication with the South Sea, which he
afterwards discovered. Gomara Hilt. c. 19. Herrera, dec. ii.
lib. ii. c. 19. In the year 1492, Behaim visited his relations in Nu-
remberg, and left with them a map drawn with his own hand, which
is still preserved among the archives of the family. Thus far the
Itory of Martin Behaim seems to be well authenticated; but the
account of his having ditcovered any part of the New World appears
to be merely conjectural.

In the former edition, as I had at that time hardly any knowledge

of Behaim but what I derived from a frivolous Dissertation de vero
Novi Orbis inventore published at Francfort, A. D. 1714, by Jo.
Frid. Sluveneus, I was induced, by the authority of Herrera, to sup-

pose

pose that Behaim was not a native of Germany; but from more full
and accurate information, communicated to me by the learned Dr.
John Reinold Forfier, I am now satisfied that I was mifhken. Dr.
Foriter has been likewise so good as to favour me with a copy of Be.
hain's map, as publifhied by Doppelmayer in his Account of the Ma-
thematicians and Arcifts of Nuremberg. From this ap, the im-
perfection of cosmographical knowledge, at that period, is manifret.
Hardly one place is laid down in its true situation. Nor can I discover
from it any realbn to fuppole that Behaim had the least knowledge of
any region in America. He delineates, indeed, an ifand to which he
gives the name of S. Brandon. This, it is imagined, may be ofme
part of Gniana, fuppu)ed at firif to be an ifand. This lie places in
the fame latitude with the Cape Verd isles, and I suspect it to be an
imaginary island which has been admitted into fonie ancient maps on
no better authority than the legend of the Irish St. Brandon or Bren-
dan, whose sPory is Ib childishly fabulous as to be unworthy of any
notice. Girald. Cambrienfis ap. Miffingham Florilegium Sanctorum,
p. 427.

THosE of the Welsh seem not to reft on a foundation much more

solid. In the twelfth century, according to Powell, a dispute having
arisen among the sons of Owen Guyneth, king of North-Wales, con.
cerning the succession to his crown, Madoc, one of their number,
weary of this contention, betook himlelf to sea in quefl of a more
quiet fettlemenr. He teered due welf, leaving Ireland to the north,
and arrived in an unknown country, which appeared to him bs de-
firable, that he returned to Wales, and carried thither several of his
adherents and companions. This is said to have happened about the
year 170, and after that, he and his colony were heard of no more.
But it is to be obfcrved, that Powell, on whole teflimony the authcn-
ticity of this story relts, publifned his history above four centuries
from the date of the event which he relates. Among a people
rude and so illiterate as the Wclfll at that period, the memory of a
tranlation so remote must have been very imperfetly preserved, and

would

would require to be confirmed by some author of greater credit, and
nearer to the era of Madoc's voyage than Powell. Later antiquaries
have indeed appealed to the testimony of Meredith ap Rhees, a Welsh
bard, who died A. D. 1477. But he too lived at such a distance of
time from the event, that he cannot be considered as a witness of
much more credit than Powell. Besides his verses published by Hak-
luyt, vol. iii, p. i. convey no information, but that Madoc, diffa-
tisfied with his domestic situation, employed himself in searching the
ocean for new pofrffions. But even if we admit the authenticity of
Powell's story, it does not follow that the unknown country which
Madoc discovered by iteering well, in such a course as to leave Ireland
to the north, was any part of America. The Ikill of the Wellh in the
twelfth century was hardly equal to such a voyage. If he made any
discovery at all, it is more probable that it was Madeira, or some other
of the western ifes. The affinity of the Wellh language with some
dialects spoken in America, has been mentioned as a circumflance
which confirms the truth of Madoc's voyage. But that has been ob-
served in so few instances, and in some of these the affinity is so obscure,
or so fanciful, that no conclusion can 'be drawn from the casual re-
semblance of a finall number of words. There is a bird, which as
far as is yet known, is found only on the coasts of South America,
fiom Port Desire to the Straits of Magellan. It is distinguished by
the name of Penguin. This word in the Welsh language signifies
White- ead. Alnioft- all the authors who favour the pretensions of the
Welsh to the discovery of America, mention this as an irrefragable
proof of the affinity of the Welsh language with that spoken in this
region of America. But Mr. Pennant, who has given a scientific
description of the Penguin, observes, that all the birds of this genus
have black heads, " so that we must resign every hope (adds he)
founded on this hypothesis of retrieving the Cambrian race in the New
World." Philof. Tranfha. vol. Iviii. p. 9., &c. Beside this, if the
Wellh, towards the close of the twelfth century, had fettled in any part
of America, some remains of the Christian doctrine and rites must have
been found among their descendants, when they were discovered about

3 three

three hundred years polterior to their migration, a period so fhorr,
that, in the course of it, we cannot well lilppole that all European
ideas and arts would be totally forgotten. Lord Lytteiton, in his notes
to the fifth book of his Hiltory of Henry II. p. 71. has examined
what Powell relates concerning the discoveries nm.le by Madoc, and
invalidates the truth of his flory by other arguments of great weight.

THE pretensions of the Norwegians to te discovery of Ainerica,

seem to be better founded than those of the Germans or Welfi.
The inhabitants of Scandinavia were remarkable in the middle ages
for the boldness and extent of their maritime excursions. In 8-4, the
Norwegians discovered, and planted a colony in Iceland. In 982,
they discovered Greenland, and elablifhed fettlenients there. From
that, some of their navigators proceeded towards the well, and dif-
covered a country more inviting than thoie horrid regions with which
they are acquainted. According to their reprefent.ition, this country
was sandy on the coasts, but in the interior parts level and covered
with wood, on which account they gave it the name of [,I!/ce-land,
and Mark-land, and having afterwards found lbme plants of the vine
which bore grapes, they called it Win land. 'he crelit of tils llory
refts, as far as I know, on the authority of the Ji/,, or chronicle of
king Olaus, compoled by Snorro Srlonides, ot Stuirluil., publifned

place where the Norwegians landed may be supposed to be situated in
latitude 49°. But that is not the region of the vine in America. From
peruing Snorro's tale, I hould think that the fGtuation of Newfoundland
corresponds belt with that of the country discovered by the Norwe-
gians. But grapes are not the produEtion of that barren island.
Other conjectures are mentioned by M. Mallet, Introd. a l'Hifi. de
Dannem. 175, &c. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the literature
of the north, to examine them. It seems manifest, that if the Norwe-
gians did discover any part of America at that period, their attempts
to plant colonies proved unsuccessful, and all knowledge of it was
soon loft.

SO firmly were men of science, in that age, persuaded that the coun-

tries which Columbus had discovered were connected with the East

Indies, that Bernaldes, the curate of Los Palacios, who seems to have
been no inconsiderable proficient in the knowledge of cofrnography,
contends that Cuba was not an island, but a part of the continent,
and united to the dominions of the Great Khan. This he delivered
as his opinion to Columbus himself, who was his guest for some time
on h's return from his second voyage; and he supports it by several
arguments, mostly founded on the authority of Sir John Mandeville.
MS. penes me. Antonio Gallo, who was secretary to the magistracy of
Genoa towards the close of the fifteenth century, published a short
account of the navigations and discoveries of his countryman Colum-
bus, annexed to his Opufcula Hiftorica de rebus populi Genuenfis; in
which he informs us, from letters of Columbus which he himself had
seen, that. it was his opinion, founded upon nautical observations,
that one of the islands he had discovered was distant only two hours or
thirty degrees from Cattigara, which, in the charts of the geographers
of that age, was laid down, upon the authority of Ptolemy, lib. vii.
c. 3. as the most easterly place in Asia. From this he concluded,
that if some unknown continent did not obftruft the navigation, there
must be a short and easy access, by holding a westerly course, to this
extreme region of the East. Muratori Scriptores Rer. Italicarum,

COLUMBUS seems to have formed some very singular opinions

concerning the countries which he had now discovered. The

violent swell and agitation of the waters on the coaff of Trinidad led
him to conclude, that this was the highest part of the terraqueous
globe, and he imagined that various circumflances concurred in prov-
ing that the sea was here visibly elevated. Having adopted this
erroneous principle, the apparent beauty of tle country induced him
to fall in with a notion of Sir John Mandeville, c. I02. that the ter-
refsrial paradise was the highelt land in the earth; and he believed
that he had been so fortunate as to discover this happy abode. Nor
ought we to think it firange that a person of so much sagacity flhould
be influenced by the opinion or reports of such a fabulous author as
Mandeville. Columbus and the other dicfoverers were obliged to
follow such guides as they could find; and it appears fiom several
passages in the mranufcript of A/ndr. Bernaldes, the friend of Colum-
bus, that no inconsiderable degree of credit was given to the teflitnony
of Mandeville in that age. Bernaldes frequently quotes him, and

of both the voyages which lie made to the New World, and of con-
founding the one with the other, in order that lie might arrogate to

Cadiz from the coast of Paria, and touched at Hispaniola only in

that God our Lord, who is one and eternal, created the heaven and
the earth,. and one man and one woman, of whom you and we, .and all
the men who have been or flall be in the world, are descended. But
as it has conme to paTs, through the number of generations during
mlore than five thousand years, that they have been disperscd into dif-
ferent parts of the world, and are divided into various kingdoms and

provinces,

provinces, because one country was not able to contain them, nor
could they have found in one the means of fubfiflence and preferva-
tion; therefore God our Lord gave the charge of all those people to
one man, named St. Peter, whom he coirifituted the'lord and head
of all the human race, that all men, in whatever place they are born,
or in whatever faith or place they are educated, might yield obedience
unto him. He hath fubjeEted the whole world to his jurildictio:l,
and commanded him to etablilh his. reidence in Rome, as the most
proper place for the government of the world. H-e likewilc promised
and gave him power to eftablilh his authority in every other part of
the world, and to judge and govern all Christians, Moors, Jews, Gen-
tiles, and all other people, of whatever ifec or faith they may be. To
him is given the name of Pope, which signifies admirable, great father
and guardian, because he is the father and governor of all men.
Those who lived in the time of this holy father obeyed and acknow-
ledged him as their lord and king, and the superior of the univerie.
The fame has been obfcrved with re)ecct to them who, ince his time,
have been chofer to the pontificate. Thus it now continues, al.
will continue to the end of the world..

' ONE of these pontiffs, as lord of the world, hath maldea grant of

these islands, and of the Terra Firma of the ocean ea, to the Catholic
kings of Castile, Don Ferdinand and Donna Isabella, of glorious
memory, and their successors, our sovereigns, with all they contain, as,
is. more fully expressed in certain deeds passed upon that occasion,
which you may fee, if you desire it. Thus his majesty is king and
lord of thiee islands, and of the continent, in virtue of this dona-
tion; and, as king and lord aforesaid, most of the islands to which his
title hath been notified, have recognized his majesty, and now yield
obedience and ibjection to him as their lord, voluntarily and without
refiltance; and instantly, as foori as they received information, they
obeyed the religious men sent by the king to preach to them, and to
inltrutl thenm in our holy faith; and all these, of their own free-will,
without any recolnpence or gratuity, became Christians, and continue

to be so; and his majesty having received them graciously under his
protection, has commanded that they mhould be treated in.the fame
manner as his other subjects and vassals. You are bound and obliged
to aR in the fame manner. Therefore I now entreat and require you
to confider attentively what I have declared to you ; and that you
may more perfectly comprehend it, that you take such time as is rea-
fonable, in order that you may acknowledge the Church as the fupe-
rior and guide of the universe, and likewise the holy father called the
Pope, in his own right, and his majesty by his appointment, as king
and sovereign lord of there islands, and of the Terra Firma; and that
you consent that the foresaid holy fathers flhall declare and preach to
you the dotrines above mentioned. If you do this, you act well,
and perform that to which you are bound and obliged; and his ma-
jefty, and I in his name, will receive you with love and kindness, and
will leave you, your wives and children, siee and exempt from fervi-

the inhabitants of the islands. Besides this, his majesty will beitow
upon you many privileges, exemptions, and rewards. But if you
will not comply, or maliciously delay to obey my injunction, then,
with the help of God, I will enter your country by force, I will carry
on war against you with the utnoft violence, I will subject you to
the yoke of obedience to the church and the king, I will take your

that all the bloodflcd and calamities which fllall follow are to be im-

AS a particular description makes a stronger impreflion than general

assertions, I flall give one of Rio de la Plata by an eye-witness.

P. Cattane, a Modenefe jesuit, landed at Buenos Ayres in I749,
and thtus represents what he felt when such new objects were first pre-
sented to his view. " While I resided in Europe, and read in books
of history or geography that the mouth of the river De la Plata was
an hundred and ifty miles in breadth, I confidered it as an exag-
geration, because in this hemisphere we have no example of such vast
rivers. When I approached its mouth, I had the most vehement desire
to ascertain the truth with my own eyes, and I have -found the matter
to be exactly as it was represented. Tils I deduce particularly from
one circumnlance: When we took our departure from Monte-Video,
a fort situated more than a 'hundred miles fiom the mouth of the river,
and where its breadth is considerably diminified, we failed a complete
day before we discovered the land on the opposite bank of the river;
and when we were in the middle of the channel, we could not discern
land on either fide, and saw nothing but the fy and water, as if we
had been in some great ocean. Indeed, we flhould have taken it to
be sea, if the fiefli water of the river, which was turbid like the Po,
had not fadisfied us that it was a river. Moreover, at Buenos Ayres,
another hundred miles up the river, and where it is fill much nar-
rower, one cannot discern the opposite coast, which is indeed very

AC o S TA is the first philosopher, as far as I know, who en-

deavoured to account for the different degrees of heat in the old

and new co:tinents, by the agency of the winds which blow in
each. Hist. Moral. &c. lib. ii. & iii. M. de Buffon adopts this
theory, and has not only improved it by new observations, but has
employed his amazing powers of descriptive eloquence in embelliflhing
and placing it in the mot fl-riking light. Some remarks may be added,
which tend to illustrate more fully a doctrine of much importance in
every inquiry concerning the temperature of various climates.

WHEN a cold wind blows over land, it mull in its paflltge rob the

surface of some of its heat. By means of this, the coldliefs of the
wind is abated. But if it continue to blow in the faine direction, it
will come, by degrees, to pass over a lilrface already cooled, and will

VOL. I. 3 M flffer

fuffr no longer any abatement of its own keenness. Thus, as it ad-
yances over a large trat of land, it brings on all the severity of intense
frost.

LET the fame wind blow over an extensive and deep ea; the super-

ficial water must be immediately cooled to a certain degree,' and the
wind proportionally warmed. But the superficial and colder water
becoming specifically heavier than the warmer water below it, de-
scends; what is warmer supplies its place, which, as it comes to be
cooled in its turn, continues to warm the air which pafies over it, or
to diminish its cold. This change of the superficial water, and fuccef-
five ascent of that which is warmer, and consequent successive abate-
ment ofcoldnefs in the air, is aided by the agitation caused in the sea
by the mechanical acion of the wind, and also by the motion of the
tides. This will go on, and the rigour of the wind will continue to
diminish until the whole water is so far cooled, that the water on the
firface is no longer removed from the action of the wind, fast enough
to hinder it from being arrested by frost. Whenever the surface
freezes, the wind is no longer warmed by the water from below, and
it goes on with undiminished cold.

FROM those principles may be explained the severity of winter

frofs in extensive continents; their mildness in small islands; and
the superior rigour of winter in those parts of North America with
which we are bes acquainted. In the north-welt parts of Europe,
the severity of winter is mitigated by the weft winds, which usually
blow in the months of November, December, and part of January.

ON the other hand, when a warm wind blows over land, it heats

the lurface, which must therefore cease to abate the fervour of the
wind. But the fame wind blowing over water, agitates it, brings
up the colder water from below, and thus is continually losing some-
what of its own heat.

2 BUT

BUT the great power of the ea to mitigate the heat of the wind or

air passing over it, proceeds from the following circumstance, that on
account of the transparency of the ea, its surface cannot be heated to
a great degree by the fun's rays; whereas the ground, fubje&ed to
their influence, very oon acquires great heat. When, therefore,
the wind blows over a torrid continent, it is oon raiied to a heat
almost intolerable; but during its passage over an extensive ocean,
it is gradually cooled; so that on its arrival at the farthet shore, it
is again fit for respiration.

THOSE principles will account for the sultry heats of large conti-

nents in the torrid zone; for the mild climate of illands in the fame
latitude; and for the superior warmth in immrner which large con-
tinents, situated in the temperate or colder zones of the earth, enjoy,
when compared with that of islands. The heat of a climate depends
not only upon the immediate effeet of the fun's rays, but on their
continued operation, on the effect which they have formerly produced,
and which remains for some time in the ground. This is the reason
why the day is warmest about two in the afternoon, the summer
warmest about the middle of July, and the winter coldest about the
middle of January.

THE forests which cover America, and hinder the sun-beams from

heating the ground, are a great cause of the temperate climate in the
equatorial parts. The ground, not being heated, cannot heat the
air; and the leaves, which receive the rays intercepted from the
ground, have not a mas of matter sufficient to absorb heat enough
for this purpose. Betides, it is a known fat, that the vegetative
power of a plant occasions a perspiration fiom the leaves in propor-
tion to the heat to which they are exposed; and, from the nature of
evaporation, this perspiration produces a cold in the leaf proportional
to the perspiration. Thus the effe of the leaf in heating the air in
contact with it, is prodigiously diminifled. For those obfcrvations,

T H E climate of Brasil has been described by two eminent natu-

ralifs, Pifo and Margrave, who observed it with a philofophi-

cal accuracy, which we desiderate in the accounts of many other
provinces in America. Both represent it as temperate and mild, when
compared with the climate of Africa. They ascribe this chiefly to the
refreshing wind which blows continually from the sea. The air is not
only cool, but chilly through the night, in so much that the natives
kindle fires every evening in their huts. Pifo de Medicina Bralili-
enfi, lib. i. p. i, &c. Margravius Hiftor. Rerum Natural. Brafilise,

THE most obvious and probable cause of this superior degree of

cold, towards tl fobuthern extremity of America, seems to be the form
of the continent there. Its breadth gradually dec¢eases as it stretches
from St. Antoni9 southwards, and from the ay of S. Julian o the
Straits of Magellai its dimregAp are m.ch contra ei, QOn the easa

and

and weft fides, it is washed by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.. From
its fouthcrn point it is probable that an open sea extends to the
Antartic pole. In whichever of these directions the wind blows, it is
cooled before it approaches the Magellanic regions, by paring over
a vast body of water, nor is the land there of such extent that it can
recover any considerable degree of heat in its progress over it. These
circumstances concur in rendering the temperature of the air in this
diftlri& of America, more similar to that of an insular, than to that of
a continental climate, and hinder it from acquiring the fame degree
of summer heat, with places in Europe and Asia, in a correiponding
northern latitude. The north wind is the only one that reaches this
part of America, after blowing over a great continent. But from
an attentive survey of its position, this will be found to have a ten-
dency, rather to diminish than augment the degree of heat. The
southern extremity of America is properly the termination of the im-
mense ridge of the Andes, which stretches nearly in a direct line from
north to south, through the whole extent of the continent. The
most sultry regions in South-America, Guiana, Brasil, Paraguay, and
Tucuman, lie many degrees to the east of the Magellanic regions.
The level country of Peru, which enjoys the tropical heats, is litu-
ated considerably to the weft of them. The north wind then, though
it blows over land, does not bring to the southern extremity of
America, an increase of heat colleted in its passage over torrid re-
gions, but before it arrives there, it must have swept along the
summits of the Andes, and comes impregnated with the cold of that
frozen region.

TroucH it be now demonstrated that there is no southern conti-

nent in that region of the globe'which it was supposed to occupy, it
appears to be certain from Captain Cook's discoveries, that there is a
large tract of land near the south pole, which is the fburce of most of
the ice spread over the vast southern ocean, vol. ii. p. 230. 239, &c.

between the latitude of 54° and 55o ihould in the very height of Sum-
mer, be, in a manner, wholly covered, many fathoms deep, with
fiozen fiiow; but more especially the S. W. coast? The very fum-
nits of the lofty mountains were cased with snow and ice; but the
quantity which lay in the valleys is incredible; and at the bottom of

IN forne places of the ancient continent, an extraordinary degree of

cold prevails in very low latitudes. Mr. Bogle, in his embassy to
the court of the Delai Lama, passed the Winter of the year 1774 at
Chamnanning, in latitude 3° 39' N. He often found the ther-
mometer in his room twenty-nine degrees under the freezing point
by Fahrenheit's scale; and in the middle of April the tfanding waters
were all frozen, and heavy showers of snow frequently fell. The
extraordinary elevation of the country seems to be the cause of this
exceflive cold. In travelling from Indoftan to Thibet, the ascent to
the summit of the Bontan Mountains is very great, but the descent
on the other fide is not in equal proportion. The kingdom of Thi-
bet is an elevated region, extremely bare and desolate. Account of
Thibet, by Mr. Stewart, read in the Royal Society, p. 7. The ex-
traordinary cold in low latitudes in America cannot be accounted for
by the fame cause. Those regions are not remarkable for elevation,
Some of them are low and flat countries.

THE animals of America seem not to have been always of a size

of the river Scioto with the Ohio. It is about four miles distant front
the banks of the latter, on the fide of the marll called the Great
Salt Lick. The bones lie in vast quantities about five or fix feet
under ground, and the ltratum is visible in the bank on the edge of

ceiving a greater number of specimens, and after infpeting them
more narrowly, they are now allowed to be the bones of an animal.
As the elephant is the largest known quadruped, and the tuks which
were found nearly resembled, both in form and quality, the tusks of
an elephant, it was concluded that the carcases deposited on the Ohio
were of that species. But Dr. Hunter, one of the persons of our
age best qualified to decide with refpe& to this point, having accu-
rately examined several parcels of tusks, and grinders, and jaw-bones,
sent from the Ohio to London, gives it as his opinion, that they
did not belong to an elephant, but to some huge carnivorous animal
of an unknown species. Phil. TranfaC. vQl. Iviii. p. 34. Bones

to the torrid zone, and never multiplies beyond it. In such cold
regions as thofee bordering on the frozen ea, he could not live. The
existence of such large animals in America might open a wide field
for conjecure. The more we contemplate the face of nature, and
confider the variety of her productions, the more we must be satis-
fled that aftonilhing changes have been made in the terraqueous

During a winter, long in many provinces, and rigorous in all, no

W ERE this the place for entering into a long and intricate geo-

graphical disquisition, many curious observations might arise

from comparing the accounts of the two Ruffian voyages, and the
charts of their refpetive navigations. One remark is applicable to
both. We cannot rely with absolute certainty on the position which
they assign to several of the places which they visited. The weather
was so extremely foggy, that they seldom saw the fun or stars, and
the position of the islands and supposed continents was commonly de-
termined by reckoning, not by observation. Behring and Tfchirikow
proceeded much farther towards the east than Krenitzin. The land
discovered by Behring, which he imagined to be part of the American
continent, is in the 236th degree of longitude from the first me-
ridian in the ine of Ferro, and in 58° 28" of latitude. Tfcllirikow
came upon the fame coast in longit. 241°, lat. 56°. Muller, i.
248, 249. The former must have advanced 60 degrees from the
port of Petropawlowfka, from which he took his departure, and the
latter 65 degrees. But from the chart of Krenitzin's voyage,, it ap-
pears that he did not fail firther towards the eafl than the 208 th de-
gree, and only 32 degrees from Petropawlowfka. In 1741, Behring
and Tfchirikow, both in going and returning, held a course which
was mostly to the south of that chain of islands which they discovered,

and

and observing the mountainous and rugged aspea of the head-lands
which they descried towards the north, they supposed them to be
promontories belonging to rome part of the American continent,
which, as they fancied, itretched as far south as the latitude 56. In
this manner they are laid down in the chart publilhed by Muller,
and likewise in a manuscript chart drawn by a mate of Behring's
ihip, communicated to me by Mr. Professor Robifon. But in 1769,
Krenitzin, after wintering in the island Alaxa, stood so far towards the
north in his return, that his course lay through the middle of what
they had supposed to be a continent, which he found to be an open
sea, and that they had mistaken rocky isles for the head-lands of a
continent. It is probable, that the countries discovered in 1741, to-
wards the east, do not belong to the American continent, but are
only a continuation of the chain of islands. From the extreme
summer cold of all those ifes, one is led to conjecture that no large
continent lies very near to them. The number of volcanos in this
region of the globe is remarkable. There are several in Kamchatka,
and not one of the islands, great or small, as far as the Ruffian na-
vigation extends, is without them. Many are atually burning, and
the mountains in all bear marks of having been once in a state of
eruption. Were I disposed to admit such conje&tures as have found
place in other inquiries concerning the peopling of America, I might
suppose that this part of the earth, having fufered violent convul-
lions from earthquakes and volcanos, an isthmus, which may have
formerly united Asia to America, has been broken, and formed into
a clufler of islands by the shock.

IT is singular, that at the very time the Ruffian navigators were

attempting to make discoveries in the north-west of America, the
Spaniards were prosecuting the fame design from another quarter. In
1769, two small vcffels failed from Loretto in California to explore
the coasts of the country to the north of that peninsula. They ad-
vanced no farther than the port of Monte-Rey in latitude 36. But,
in several successive expeditions fitted out from the port of St. Blas in

of those voyages have not yet been published, I cannot compare their
progress with that of the Ruffians, or shew how near the navigators
of the two nations have approached to each other. It is to be hoped,
that the enlightened minister, who has now the direction of Ameri-
can affairs in Spain, will not withhold this information from the
public.

F E W travellers have had such opportunity of observing the na-

tives of America, in its various difirits, as Don Antonio Ulloa.

In a work lately published by him, he thus describes the characterif-
tical features of the race: " a very finall forehead, covered with hair
towards its extremities, as far as the middle of the eye-brows; little
eyes; a thin nose, small and bending towards the upper lip; the
countenance broad; the ears large; the hair very black, lank, and
coarse; the limbs well turned, the feet finall, the body of just pro-
portion; and altogether finooth and free from hair, until old age,
when they acquire frome beard, but never on the cheeks." Noticias
Americanas, &c. p. 307. M. le Chevalier de Pinto, who resided
fiveral years in a part of America which Ulloa never visited, gives a
fletch of the general aspet of the Indians there. " They are all of
copper colour, with some diversity of shade, not in proportion to their
ditance from the equator, but according to the degree of elevation
of the territory which they inhabit.. Those who live in a high country
;Ire fairer than those in the marshy low lands on the coast. Their

the coasts of the South Sea, on the river of Amazons, and the river
Orinoco, are not to be compared for strength with those in cold

the rapidity of the ftrcam, and with the fame crew they proceed to
San Pablo, which is eight hundred leagues distant. No cw of.

innumerable, and such diversity of climates, appear nevertheless like
the children of one father and mother. Chronica del' Peru, parte i.

peculiarity of afpe&, which forms what may be called a European or
Asiatic countenance. There muff likewise be one that may be de-
nominated American, common to the whole race. This may be
supposed to strike the traveller at first fight, while the various shades,
which distinguish people of different regions, escape his observation.
But when persons who had resided so long among the Americans
concur in bearing testimony to the similarity of their appearance in
every climate, we may conclude that it is more remarkable than that
of any other race. See likewise Garcia Origen de los Indies, p. 54.

have been collected and stated with a considerable degree of accu-

visited the Magellanic regions, and, like their predecessors, differ very
widely in their accounts of its inhabitants. By Commodore Byron and
his crew, who failed through the Straits in 1764, the common size of
the Patagonians was estimated to be eight feet, and many of them much
taller. Phil. Transact. vol. vii. p. 78. By Captains Wallis and
Carteret, who actually measured them in 1766, they were found to be
from fix feet to fix feet five and seven inches in height. Phil. Tranf,
vol. Ix. p. 22. Thele seem to have been the very people whose size
had been so much over-rated in the year 1764; for several of them
had beads and red baize of the fame kind with what had been put:
aboard Captain Vallis's hip, and he naturally concluded that they
had got these from Mr. Byron. Hawkefw. i. In 1767 they were
again measured by M. Bougainville, whose account agrees nearly with
that of Captain Wallis. Voy. 29. To these I flall add a testimony
-of great weight. In the year 1762, Don Bernardo Ibagnez de Echa-

ANToNIo SANCHEZ RIBEIRO, a learned and ingenious physician,

published a dissertation in the year 1765, in which he endeavours

to prove, that this disease was not introduced from America, but
took its rife in Europe, and was brought on by an epidemical and
malignant disorder. Did I chufe to enter into a dii'quifition on.
this subjet, which I hould not have mentioned, if it had not been
intimately connected with this part of my inquiries, it would not be
difficult to point out ome mistakes with respect to the facts upon
which he founds, as well as some errors in the consequences which
he draws from them. The rapid communication of this disease from.
Spain over Europe, seems, however, to resemble the progress of an
epidemic, rather than that of a disease transmitted by infection. The
first mention of it is in the year 1493, and before the year 1497 it had
made its appearance in most countries of Europe, with such alarming
symptoms as rendered it necessary for the civil magistrate to interpose,
in order to check its career. Since the publication of this work, a
iecond edition of Dr. Sanchez's Difertation has been communicated
to me. It contains several additional fats in confirmation of his
opinion, which is supported with such plausible arguments, as render
it a subjeCt of inquiry well defirving the attention of learned phy-
ficians.

AS the view which I have given of rude nations is extremely dif-

ferent from that exhibited by very refpetable authors, it may

be proper to produce orme of the many authorities on which I found
my description. The manners of the savage tribes in America have
never been viewed by persons more capable of observing them with
discernment, than the philosophers employed by France and Spain, in
the year 1735, to determine the figure of the earth. M. Bouguer
Antonio d'Ulloa, and D. George Juan, resided long among the na-
tives of the least civilized provinces in Peru. M. de la Condamine
had not only this opportunity for observation, but, in his voyage
down the Maragnon, he had an opportunity of infpecing the state of
the various nations feated on its banks, in its vast course across the
continent of South America. There is a wonderful resemblance in
their representation of the chara&er of the Americans. " They are
all extremely indolent," fays M. Bouguer, " they are stupid, they
pass whole days fitting in the fame place, without moving, or speak-
ing a tingle word. It is not easy to describe the degree of their in-
difference for wealth, and all its advantages. One does not well
know what motive to propose to them, when one would perifade
them to perform any service. It is vain to offer them money; they
answer, that they are not hungry." Voyage au Perou, p. 102. " If
one confiders them as men, the narrowness of their underitanding
seems to be incompatible with the excellence of the foul. Their im-
becillity is so visible, that one can hardly form an idea of them dif-
ferent fiom what one has of the brutes. Nothing disturbs the tran-
quillity of their fouls, equally insensible to disasters and to proljierity.
Though half-naked, they are as contented as a monarch in his most
Iplendid array. Riches do not attract them in the finallefl- degree,
and the authority or dignities to which they may aspire, are so little
the objects of their ambition, that an Indian will receive with the
fime indifference the office of a judge (Alcalde) or that of a hangman,
if deprived of the former and appointed to the latter. Nothing can

little. Their dilpofition is so singular,. that there is no'method of
influencing them, no means of rouzing them from that indifference,
which is proof againit all the endeavours of the wisest persons; no ex-
pedient which can induce them to abandon that gross ignorance, or
lay aside that careless negligence, which disconcert the prudence and
disappoint the care of iuch as are attentive to their welfare."-

libility," fays M. de la Condamine, " is the bails of the American
charater. I leave others to determine, whether this should be
dignified with the name of apathy, or disgraced with that of ftu-
pidity. It arises, without doubt, from the finall number of their
ideas, which do not extend beyond their wants. Gluttons even to
voracity, when they have wherewithal to satisfy their appetite.
Temperate, when neceflity obliges them, to such a degree that they
can endure want.without seeming to desire any thing. Pusillanimous
and cowardly to excess, unless when they are rendered desperate by
drunkenness. Averse to labour, indifferent to every motive of glory,
honour, or gratitude; occupied entirely by the object that is present,
and always determined by it alone, without any solicitude about
futurity; incapable of foresight or of refleEtion; abandoning them-
selves, when under no restraint,, to a puerilejoy, which they express.

If this description were applicable only to the Indians. in ome pro-
vinces of Peru, who are slaves in every refpec bt the name, one
might believe, that this degree of degeneracy was occasioned by the
felvile dependence to which they are reduced; the example of the
modern Greeks being proof how far servitude may degrade the human
iecies. But the Indiahs in the miflions of the Jciid4s, andl the savages

who

who ill enjoy unimpaired liberty, being as limited in their faculties,
not to fay as stupid as the other, one cannot observe, without humi-
liation, that man, when abandoned to simple nature, and deprived of
the advantages resulting from education and society, differs but little
from the brute creation." Voyage de la Riv. deAmaz. 52, 53. M.
de Chanvalon, an intelligent and pliiloibphical observer, who visited
Martinico in 751, and reided there fix years, gives the following
description of the Caraibs. " It is not the red colour of their com-
plexion, it is not the singularity of their features, which constitutes
the chief difference between them and us. It is their exceflive fim-
plicity; it is the limited degree of their faculties. Their reason is
not more enlightened or more provident than the inftint of brutes.
The reason of the most gross peasants, that of the negroes brought
up in the parts of Africa most remote from intercourse with Euro-
peans, is such that we discover appearances of intelligence, which,
though imperfect, is capable of increase. But of this the understand-
ing of Caraibs seems to be hardly susceptible. If found philosophy
and religion did not afford us their light, if we were to decide accord-
ing to the first impression which the view of that people makes upon
the mind, we hould be disposed to believe that they do not belong
to the fame species with us. Their stupid eyes are the true mirrour
of their fouls; it appears to be without functions. Their indolence
is extreme; they have never the least solicitude about the moment
which is to succeed that which is present." Voyage a la Martinique,
p. 44, 45. 51. M. de la Borde, Tertre, and Rochefort, confirm
this description. " The characteriflics of the Californians," fays P.
Venegas, " as well as of all. other Indians, are stupidity and in-
sensibility; want of knowledge and reflecion; inconstancy, impetuo-
fity, and blindness of appetite; an exceflve sloth, and abhorrence of
all labour and fatigue; an excefilve love of pleasure and amuse-
ment of every kind, however trifling or brutal; pusillanimity;
and, in fine, a mos wretched want of every thing which constitutes
the real man, and renders him rational, inventive, tracable, and use-

ful.

fil to himself and society. It is not easy for Europeans, who never
were out of their own country, to conceive an adequate idea of those
people: for, even in the least frequented corners of the globe, there
is not a nation so stupid, of such contracted ideas, and so weak both
in body and minds as the unhappy Californians. Their understand-
ing comprehends little more than what they fee; abftrat ideas, and
much less a chain of reasoning, being far beyond their power; to
that they scarce ever improve their first ideas, and these are in general
false, or at least inadequate. It is in vain to represent to them any
future advantages which will result to them from doing or abstaining
from this or that particular immediately present; the relation of
mneans and ends being beyond the firetch of their faculties. Nor
have they the least notion of pursuing such intentions as will procure
themselves rome future good, or guard them againiffuture evils. Their
will is proportional to their faculties, and all their paflions move in a
very narrow sphere. Ambition they have none, and are more desirous
of being accounted ftiong than valiant. The objects of ambition with
us, honour, fame, reputation, titles, posts, and diftintions of fuperi-
ority, are unknown among them; so that this powerful spring of
action, the cause of so much seeming good and real evil in the world,
has no power here. This disposition of mind, as it gives them up to
an amazing languor and lassitude, their lives fleeting away in a per-
petual inactivity and detestation of labour, so it likewise induces them
to be attracted by the first object which their own fancy, or the per-
suasion of another, place before them; and at the fame time renders
them as prone to alter their resolutions with the fame facility. They
look with indifference upon any kindness done them; nor is even the
bare remembrance of it to be expected from them. In a word, the
unhappy mortals may be compared to children, in whom the devc-
lopemcnt of reason is not completed. They may indeed be called a
nation who never arrive at manhood." I-Hift. ofCaliforn. Engl. Tranfl.

TIHE incapacity of the Americans is so remarkable, that negroes

from all the different provinces of Africa are observed to be more
capable of improving by instruction. They acquire the knowledge of
several particulars which the Americans cannot comprehend. Hence
the negroes, though slaves, value themselves as a superior order of

I HAVE observed, p. 297. that, for the hlme reason, they never

attempt to rear children who are feeble, distorted, or defective in

the Americans, that the Peruvians, a civilized people, when compared
with the barbarous tribes, whose manners I am defcri bing, retained them;
and even their intercourse with the Spaniards has not been able to root
them out. When twins are born in any family, it is still confidered
as an ominous event, and the parents have recourse to rigorous ats
of mortification, in order to avert the calamities with which they are
threatened. When a child is born with any deformity, they will not,
if they can pofibly avoid it, bring it to be baptized, and it is with
difficulty they can be brought to rear it. Arriaga Extirpac. de la

R EMARKABLE instances occur of the calamities which rude nations

susser by famine. Alvar Nugnez Cabeca de Vaca, one of the

most gallant and virtuous of the Spanifl adventurers, resided almost
nine years among the savages of Florida. They were unacquainted
with every species of agriculture. Their subsistence was poor and
precarious. " They live chiefly," fays he, "c upon roots of different
plants, which they procure with great difficulty, wandering from
place to place in search of them. Sometimes they kill some game,
sometimes they catch fish, but in such small quantities, that their hun-
ger is so extreme as compels them to eat spiders, the eggs of ants,
worms, lizards, irpents, a kind of unCtuous earth, and I am per-
fuaded, that if in this country there were any stones, they would
swallow these. They preserve the bones of fishes and serpents, which

they grind into powder, and eat. The only season when they do not
susser much from famine, is when a certain fruit, which he calls Tunas,
is ripe. This is the fame with the Opuntia, or prickly pear, of a
reddish and yellow colour, with a sweet insipid taste. They are
sometimes obliged to travel far from their usual place of residence,
in order to find them. Naufragias, c. xviii. p. 20, 21, 22. In

stretches from the oth to the 38th degree of northern latitude. It is of
great extent, and fiom its square form mult be much more than equal
to all Europe. The people who inhabit the various parts of it appear
to be of one race. They are evidently ruder than most of the Ame-
ricans, and have made still less progress in improvement and the arts
of life. There is not the least appearance of cultivation in any part
of this vast region. The inhabitants are extremely few, so that the
country appears almost dcfolate. Their tribes are still more incon-
fiderable than those of America. They depend for subsistence, almost
entirely, on fiffling. They do not fettle in one place, but roam about
in quest of food. Both sexes go itark-naked. Their habitations,
utensils, &c. arc more simple and rude than those of the Americans.

which we could not fee the boundaries, through which there flowed
many brooks and rivers, but without any path to conduct us. Some-
times we were obliged to open a pailage across thick forests, through
bushes, and underwood filled with briars and thorns. Sometimes we
had to pass through deep marshes, in which we funk up to the middle.
After being fatigued through the day, we had the earth for our bed,
or a few leaves, exposed to the wind, the rain, and all the injuries of

I STRONGLY fufipec that a community of goods, and an undivided

flore, are known only among the rudest tribes of hunters; and

that as soon as any fpccies of agriculture or regular idurify is known,
the idea of an exclusive right of property to the fruits of them is in-
troduced. I am confirmed in this opinion by accounts which I lnve
received concerning the state of property among the Indians in very

3 P 2 diflferent

different regions of America. The idea of the natives of Brasil
concerning property is, that if any person cultivate a field, he alone
ought to enjoy the produce of it, and no other has a title to pretend
to it. If an individual or family go a hunting or filhing, what is
caught belongs to the individual or to the family, and they commu-
nicate no part of it to any but to their cazique, or to such of their
kindred as happen to be indisposed. If any person in the village come
to their hut, he may fit down freely, and eat without asking liberty.
But this is the consequence of their general principle of hospitality;
for I never observed any partition of the increase of their fields, or
the produce of the chace, which I could confider as the result of any
idea concerning a community of goods. On the contrary, they are
so much attached to what they deem to be their property, that it
would be extremely dangerous to encroach upon it. As far as I have
seen, or can learn, there is not one tribe of Indians in South America,
among whom that community of goods which has been so highly ex-
tolled is known. The' circumstance in the government of the Jesuits,
most irksome to the Indians of Paraguay,. was the community of
goods which those fathers introduced. This was repugnant to their
original ideas of the Indians. They were acquainted with the rights
of private exclusive property, and they Submitted with imrpatience to
regulations. which destroyed them. M. le Cheval.. de Pinto,. MS,
penes me. " Aual possession (fays a missionary who resided several
years among the Indians of the Five Nations) gives a right to the
foil,. but whenever a possessor fees fit to quit it, another has as good
right to take it as he who left it. This law, or cuom,rn, relpects not
only the particular spot on which. he ercEs his houfc, but also his
planting ground. If a man has.prepared a particular slot of ground,
on which he deligns in future to. build or plant, no man has a right
to incommode him, much lcfs to the fruit of his labours, until it ap-
pears that he voluntarily gives up his views.. But 1 never heard of

allowed to hunt as far as such a river on this hand, and such a moun-
tain on the other. This area is occupied and improved by indivi-
duals and their families. Individuals, not the community, have the

T - HE description of the political state of the people of Cinaloa,

perfetly resembles that of the inhabitants of North America,

" They have neither laws nor kings (fays a missionary who resided.
long among them) to punifl any crime. Nor is there, among
them, any species of authority, or political government, to restrain
them in any part of their conduct. It is true, that they acknow-
ledge certain Caziqucs, who are heads of their families or villages, but
their authority appears chiefly in war, and the expeditions against their
enemies. This authority the Caziques obtain not by hereditary right,
but by their valour in war, or by the power and number of their fa-
milies and relations. Sometimes they owe their pre-eminence to their
eloquence in displaying their own exploits." Ribas Hiftor. de las
Triumph. &c. p. I I. The slate of the Chiquitos in South America,
is nearly the fame. " They have no regular form of government, or
civil life, but in matters of public concern they liften to the advice
of their old men, and ufiially follow it. The dignity of Cazique is not
hereditary, but conferred according to merit, as the reward of valour
in war. The union among them is inperfect. Their society refem-
bles a republic without any head, in which every man is master of

carrying on war, are generally iknown; I have founded my ob-

Frcrations chiefly upon the testimony of rhe authors who describe them.
But the fame maxims took place among other nations in the New
World. A judicious missionary has given a view of the military ope-
rations of tle people in Gran Chaco, in South America, perfectly
similar to those of the Iroquois. " They are much addiced to war
fays he), which they carry on frequently among themselves, but per-
petually againfi the Spaniards. But they may rather be called
tlieves than soldiers, for they never make head againt the Spaniards,
unless when they can afl'ault them by stealth, or have guarded against
an.y mischance by spies, who may be called indefatigable; they will
watch the settlements of the Spaniards for one, two, or three years,
observing by night every thing that passes with the utmost solicitude>
whether they may expe& resistance or not, and until they are per-
fetly ecure of the event,. they will not venture upon an attack; so
that when they do give the assault, they are certain of. success, and
free from all danger.. These spies, in order that they may not be
observed, will creep on all-four like cats in the night; but if they
are dilcovered, make their escape with much dexterity. But, al-
though they never chufe to face the Spaniards, if they be surrounded

of the Americans, which appeared to me most rational, and

supported by the authority of the most refpeQable-authors, other theo-
ries have been formed with regard to it, by writers of great eminence.
D. Ant. Ulloa, in a late work, contends, that the texture of the skin
and bodily habit of the Americans is such, that they are less sensible
of pain than the reft of mankind. He produces several proofs of this,
from the manner in which they endure the molt cruel chirurgical
operations, &c. Noticias Americanas, p. 313, 314. The fame ob-
servation has been made'by surgeons in Brasil. An Indian, they fay,
never complains under pain, and will bear the amputation of a leg or
arm without uttering a fmgle groan. MS. penes me.

THE people of Chili, the most gallant and high-fpirited of all the

Americans, are the only exception to this observation. They

attack their enemies in the open field; their troops are ranged in re-
gular order; their battalions advance to the charge not only with
courage, but with discipline. The North Americans, though many
of them have substituted the European fire-arms in place of their own
bows and arrows, frill adhere to their ancient maxims of war, and
carry it on according to their own peculiar system. But the Chilefe

with them mirrorsj probably made of stone, like those of the Mex-
icans, Dec. iv. lib. iii. c. 8. in which they delight to view them-
felvcs; but the women never use there. Dec. iv. lib. x. c. 3. He
takes notice, that among the fierce tribe of the Panches, in the new

either to pierce their lips, and to wear green sCones in them, or to
adorn their heads with plumes of feathers. Dec. vii. lib. ix. c. 4. In
tome provinces of Peru, though that empire had made considerable
progress in civilization, the slate of women was little improved. All
the toil of cultivation and domiefic work was devolved upon them,
and they were not permitted to wear Li.aclets, or other ornaments,

I Have ventured to call this mode of anointing and painting their

bodies, the dress of the Americans. This is agreeable to their

own idiom. As they never stir abroad if they are not completely
anointed; they excuse themselves when in this situation, by faying,
that they cannot appear because they are naked. Gumilla Hist. de

OM E tribes in the province of Cinaloa, on the gulf of California,
seem to be among the rudest people of America united in the so-

cial state. They neither cultivate nor sow; they have no houses in
which they reside. Those in the inland country subsist by hunting;
those on the sea-coast chiefly by filhing. Both depend upon the
spontaneous produtions of the earth, fruits, plants, and roots of
various kinds. In the rainy season, as they have no habitations to
afford them shelter, they gather bundles of reeds, or strong grass,
and binding them together at one end, they open them at the other,
and fitting them to their heads, they are covered as with a large cap,
which like a pent-house throws off the rain, and will keep them dry
for several hours. During the warm season, they form a shed with
the branches of trees, which protects them from the sultry rays of
the fun. When exposed to cold they make large fires, round which
they sleep in the open air. 1-Iiftoria de los triumfos de nueflra fanta

pearance, and are a flriking image of the rudeness of early times.
Their huts are coininoily built on iome riling ground, or on the
banks of a river, huddled iometimes together, sometimes straggling,
and always without any order. Their apcti is melancholy and dil-
agreeable. One fees nothing but what is hideous and savage. The
uncultivated fields have no gaiety. The silence which reigns there,
unless when interrupted by the difigreeable notes of birds, or cries of
wild beafls, is extremely dilinal." Relat. de la France Equin.

S O M E tribes in South America can lend their arrows to a great

difl-ance, and with considerable force, without the aid of the bow.

They make use of a hollow reed, about nine feet long, and an inch
thick, which is called a Sarbacane. In it they lodge a finall arrow,
with some unfpun cotton wound about its great end; this confines the
air, so that they can blow it with aftonifling rapidity, and a sure aim,
to the distance of above a hundred paces. These finall arrows are
always poisoned. Fermin. Defcr. de Surin. i. 55. Bancroft's Hit.

parts of their progress, and tome nations get so far the start of others
in circumstances nearly similar, that we must ascribe this to ome
events in their story, or to some peculiarity in their situation with
which we are unacquainted. The people in the island of Otaheite,
lately discovered in the South Sea, far excel most of the Americans
in the knowledge and practice of the arts of ingenuity, and yet they
had not invented any method of boiling water, and having no vefel
that would bear the fire, they had no more idea that water could be
made hot, than that it could be made solid. Voyages by Hawkef-

A Remarkable proof of this is produced by Ulloa. In weaving

hammocks, coverlets, and the other coarse cloaths, which they

are accustomed to manufacture, their industry has discovered no
more expeditious method, than to take up thread after thread, and
after counting and forting them each time, to pass the woof between
them, so that in finishing a frmail piece of theCe fluffs, they frequently
spend more than two years. Voyage, i. 336. Bancroft gives the

That of P. Ribas concerning the people of Cinaloa, coincides with
the reft. " I was extremely attentive (fays he), during the years I
resided among them, to ascertain whether they were to be confidered
as idolaters; and it may be affirmed with the most perfect exa&tnefs,
that though among rome of them there may be traces of idolatry, yet
others have not the least knowlcdge of God, or even of any false
deity, nor pay any fornal adoration to the Supreme Being,. who ex-
ercifes dominion over the world; nor have they any conception of
the providence of a creator or governor, from whom they expet in
the next life the reward of their good, or the punilhment of their evil
deeds. Neither do they publicly join in any at of divine worship.

BY the account which M. Dumont, an eye-witness, gives of the

funeral of the great chief of the Natchez, it appears, that the

feelings of the persons who suffered on that occasion were very different.
Some solicited the honour with eagerness; others laboured to avoid
their doom, and several saved their lives by flying to the woods.
As the Indian Bramins give an intoxicating draught to the women,
who are to be burnt together with the bodies of their husbands, which
renders them insensible of their approaching fate, the Natchez obliged
their viEims to swallow several large pills of tobacco, which pro-
duce a similar effet. Mem. de Lous. i. 227.

EVEN in the most intelligent writers concerning the manners of

cumftances. P. Charlevoix, who, in consequence of the controversy
between his order and that of the Franciscans, with refpel to the ta-
lents and abilities of the North Americans, is disposed to represent
both their intellecual and moral qualities in the most favourable light,
asserts, that they are engaged in continual negociations with their
neighbours, and conduct these with the most refined address. At the
fame time, he adds, that it becomes their envoys or plenipoten-
tiaries to exert their abilities and eloquence, for if the terms which
they offer are not accepted of, they had need to stand on their guard.

given to their propositions. He is not out of danger even if he is so
fortunate as to avoid the stroke, he may expec to be pursued, and if

A Caribbean canoe, with four men, two women, and a boy, fell in
mnexpectedly with the fleet of Columbus in his second voyage, as it
was steering through their islands. At si-rs, they were Itruck alniofl-

theh, so as, to cut off their commurhiicati6n with- the Ihore. " When
they saw that it was impoflTble t ecape (fayg the historian), they
seized' rheir ams with undntited refoliltion, and began. the attack.
I use the expreflion, with rdcainlted resolution, for they Were few, and
beheld a valt number ready to assault them. They Wounded several
of the Spaniards, although they had targets, as well as other defensive
armour; and even after their canoe was ovcrfet, it was with no little

A Probable conjecure may be formed with refpec to the cause of

the diflintion in character between the Caribbees and the inhabit-

ants of the larger illands. The former appear manifestly to be a fe-
parate race. Their language is totally different from that of their
neighbours in the large islands. They themselves have a tradition,
that their ancestors came originally from some part of the continent,
and having conquered and exterminated the ancient inhabitants,
took poifeflion of their lands, and of their women. Rochefort, 384.

man come from beyond sea. Labat. vi. 13 . Accordingly, the
Carillecs flill] utl two diftinc languages, one peculiar to the men,
and the other to the women. Tertre, 361. The language of the
men has nothing common with that spoken in the large islands. The
dialct of the women conliderably resembles it. labat. i29. This

the people in the northern continent, tl;an to those of the natives of
South America; and as their language has likewise lce affinity to

that spoken in Florida, their origin ihould be deduced rather from the
former than from the latter. Labat. 128, &c. Herrera, Dec. i.

destroying all the males, and preserving the women either for fervi-
tude or for breeding.
