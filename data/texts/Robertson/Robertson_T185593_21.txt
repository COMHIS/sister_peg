Majety's HISTORIOGRAPHER soT Scot-
land has no s~uperior : His performnance;,
and those of H-ume, acid honour to the: lI-
terary charadter of the I8th century.. I
cannot, however, avoid thinking, thazt th;e
learned and reverend D)r thewts a great
partiality for Alexander the Gre::t. H
attributes to this hero very profu~indl and2
solid views, by which he was to lecur e to
his country the lucrative traffc of the East.
In his Hiitory of America, 4to, vol. 1R,
p~age 14. he hias the followring paffige :

"' *ha91

' That extraordinary man (Alexander) not-
' withflanding the violent pafflons whicha
' excited him at times to thle wildest ac-
' tions, and the most extravagant enter-
' prifes, poffeffed talents which fitted him,
' not only to conquer, but to govern the
' w~~orld.'

D~r Roberts~on then holds forth Ahlexander

in three great points of view, viz. a conque-
ror oif thie weorldi, a governor of the world,
and a greart commercial foudnder. Livy,
the hifforioglapher of Rome, and Dr Ro-
bertfon, his Maj~lty's hilloriographer for
Scotland, entertain very different opinions
refpeaing the military talents of Alexan-
der. The Roman hiltorian has written an
express dissertation on the f~ubjeat; and con-
clufively declares, that Rome, with her
confalfs and did3ators at the head of her
legions, would have had nothing to fear
althoug~h Alexander had crossed the Adri-
atic at the headc of the phalanx formed by
his father. Livy, therefore, seems no way

apprehensive,

appjrehenfive, that the son of Atnmon anrd
Olympias would have pre-occupied the
throne of the Caefars. It is here to be re-
marked, that Rome, during the short ca-
reer of Alexander's glory, had not con-
quered the half of Italy, and that her war-
like armies were mere detachments, when
compared with thofre that fought after-
wards at Cannae and at Zama. Philip
formed the celebrated Macedonian phalanx
that afterwards firuck terror into the mind
of the first Roman General who invadedf
Greece. His; son Alexander chole to imi-
tate Homer's heros, or a modern captain
of grenadiers. The contrast is not in fa-
vour of Dr Robertfon's hero. The em-
pires of Alexander, of Rome, of Mlaho-
met, of Charlemagne, of Philip, of Lewes,
and of George, all prove how deftruaive
or how vain are attempts to .overgrown
monarchies. Philosophical hifforians ought
to paint Alexander as an objea of deteital
tion; and detestable no doubt he was,
when we confider the des~olation he brought

upon

upon the human race in his own perfok~w
and Rill more in the persons of his fucel~
fors. Voltaire, however, asserts, that Alex·
ander built more cities than he destroyed:
He must then have been a most fovereignr
architedt indeed', since it is well known,
that with the mos1 diabolical circumitances
of cruelty and madnes~s, he defiroyed
Thebes, Tyre, Sidon, PerfaBepolis, &c. 8&c.
Attila the Hun, a barbarian, and the s~courge
of God, coul~d neither read nor write, and
yet he was a humane conqueror when
compared with the pupil of Ariflotle, the
pupil of Socrates, who both flourished
when Greece was at her ne plusJ ultra for
the fine arts, feciences, and polite litera-

ture.

Alexander's charafter, as a grfeat captain,

depends more upon the blunders of his
enemies, than his own merit.

Greece had no principle of union; her

fa~tions and disjointed democracies, were

no (

no match for royalty wifely diretted. The
contest accordingly was very thort, and
was finally f~ettled in favour of Philip, by
his vi~tory at Cheronaea, which conveyed
to Alexander the sovereignty of Greece as
a family inheritance. The infatuated D~a-
rius had not the conmm~on frenfe to followm
found advice. Dispute the paffes--break
uip the roads-carry off the proviflous--
fighit no pitched battles: Such were the ad-
viices o~ffered! to Darius. To which may be
added as a se~lf- evident military proposition,
that an army of 200,000 archers on horse-
back, would have rendered the fall of A-
lexander a prelude to that of Crafiss. Sewn
kings, wvithout great errors, ever governed
one kingdom; none, as yet, ever governed
the wvorld ; and of many competitors, A-
lexander would not have been my choice.
The reign of the emperor Charles V. was
exceedingly a~tive; I cannot help think-
ing, that his plans and execution required
piore exertion of mind than the meteo-
rouas and des~ultory conquei~s of Alexander.

(8)

At the age of 55, Charles, tired with, and
retired from buffle, acknowledged that
his e~pisode of government was a difficult
part, and very defeaive in execution. Can
we then suppose, that a king always in
naual service, and often drunk, could per-
form the piece entire at the age of 342

If Alexander had realized his conquests,

from Pella to the banks of the Indus, and
had founded a permanent dynasty, no doubt:
his furccefrors might have attempted an East
I[ndia Company.

The state of faciety in Europe at the

time, renders it almost certain, that this
vaunted traffic would have been very limit-
ed. The commercial charader of Alex-
ander, so often dis~played by Dr. Robert-
son, seems to reft upon his having laid the
foundations of Alexandria in Egypt.

Egyptian kings had, long before this

period, confiruded a navigable canal from

the

thie i~thmus of Suez to the M~editerranean
Sjea; and barbarous Saracens, several hun-
dred years aft~er Alexander was dead
drunk, had re-eflablifhed the work. A
similar canal could not poibly exceed
the powers of the conqueror of Persia, of
Egypt, and the Sovereign of Greece and
1Vlacedon, and must necess~arily have occur-
red to a wife coimmercial Sovereign. TTyre
and Sydon were finely situated to conneft
Egypt with G~reece. Can one f~uppole,
that the brutal deltroyer of those commer-
cial cities, had wife~ views of commerce ?
WVould a commercial conqueror of H6ol-
land defiroy Amlterdam ? Wiould a com-
mnercial Canute, or William the Ballard,
attem:pt to extend the trade of Engdand
by dleflroyring London, or the shipping on
the Tihamnes ? Age~ilaus and Xienophon
hand pro~ven to Greece the imbiecility of
Persia. Commrce was not thie objeft of
the sagacious and artful Phiilip. Ndo word,
th~en, of flk;s, chintz, porcelane, &zc. ? TIhe
F·ri-·ncef-es ofacedon, at that time, fpanz

I1~LtBS and

( o )

andl wove the cloths that were worn ine
their families. Refinements in the arts of
life, and poffeflion of the precious metals,
are both requisite for nations that propose
to trade to the Indies.

It seems to me a propolition capable of

proof, that Europe in general, and Africa,
from the Nile to the Pillars of Hercules,
had not arrived at the one, and were very
defedive in the other. When the eflate
of a Rorman D~idator t~odrifed of seven
acres of land, and no more, we cannot
fuppole, that the ladies of the family were
drelfed in silk or in chintz. When the
head of the family held his own plough,
the sideboard required little elegance. The
reft of Europe, parts of Greece excepted,
was in full meaner circumitanes, and had
no exchanges to offer for the luxuries of
the East. Supposing Europe, in the days
of Alexander, to be in circumitances f~id-
lar to those of Germany s~everal hundred
years thereafter, as deferibed by Tacitus,

( x )

it is probable, that one boat's load of pep-
per, in one year, would have furpplied the
befle tables in the WVefern Wo0rld, and
would have added little to the Cuitom-
house duties of Alexandria. To revenge
upon Persia the injuries of Greece, was the
express condition of Philip's commiiron as
her Generaliffimro; and in this commrrifflon
hie was fo~cceeded by his son. In place of
crofirngr the H~ellelpont, and attacking Da-
1us, it would have been more worthy of
Arif10tle's pupil to have moulded Greece
and Macedon into an a~tive and comp~act
lovereignty. The islands of the Archipe-
lago, Greece properly so called, and the backi
country, bounded by the Danube, would
have con~tituted one of the moIR beautifcul
empires; it would have bid defiance to
Perf~a; it -would have been an insuperable
barrier to the ambition of Rome. Such an
empire might h~ave continued to modern
Greece the language of Sophocles, and
might have been transmitted to its founder's
family, in a line of fu~ccellion longer than

that

( z )

that of Hugh Capet to Lewis XVI., or that
of William the Bastard to George Ill.;
whereas, Alexander was the las1 of his

race.

To arrogate to one's s~elf divin-e honours ;

to burn a city in order to please a itrumipet ;
to murder one's bell friends; are tranfadc-
tions not to be mnet with in accompt-b-ooks
of the Medicii of F~lorence, the H-opes of
Anmfierdamn, the merch~a-nts of the H~anleatiio
League, or Aldermen of London.

With refpeft to the commercial chara~ter

of Alexander, Dr Robertson telks us, thlat
the cons~umption of India goods was very-
great at Rome.

The funeral of Sylla is given as an in-

flance. Before Sylla had humnbled Mi-
thridates, the Romans h~ad already defeated
Philip at Cynocephale; they had defeated
Antiochus at Magnesia; they had led Per-
feus in chains; they were revelling in the

spoils

( 3

sp~oils of the Eaff, and, like modern fpouilers,
they b~y no means followtedl the examnple of`
Ariilippus, as mentioned by H'orace. Th~e
fo~ppers and warrdrobe of L~ucu~llus, are
proof~s of the luxury of Romec : Bu~t Jurel-y,
r·either the funeral of Sylla, nor th-e w5ealthn
or' Lucuius, are in any mranner connei~ed
wvith thle conquerfs of Alexan:der, whol~ died~
at Babylon 260 years before Sylla was
b~orn. One mnight as; well attribute the Eaii
Inldia trade of L~ondon to C~atharinle of:

France, btecaufe thle m~arried Owen Tliudor
of WVales, the ancellor of E~izaPbeth, who
grantedl the sirs1 charter. Alexander died
324C years before the Chrkflian aera, at a
time wh:en the Agrrarian law existed at
Raome, and when the R~omans hiad made
mo advances inluxury or rehinement. So
far were they f~romi beinga m~aters of Ita~ly,
thiat after the above period, the Samn-
nites made two conf~illar armies pal~s under
thie yok~e, at the forks of Candium. Pyr-
rhius, thie Epirote, lived ab~out 5 o years after
ALlexanlder. Tie famous Fab~ricius wras hiis

aival

( 4 )

rival in the field; and it is well krnown,
that the mranners of Fabricius were fitted
to a freeholder of s~even acres. The Ro-
mans had not then coined silver money,
andl were in no refpel2 able to undertake
the commerce of the Eall, which requires
a large capital. From the days of Romu-
Jus, the son of the god Mars, to the days
of Attila, Ro~me had exh~ibited the figure
of th~e Sphinx's riddle; the had pass~ed
th~rough- thle diffecrent flages of exiffence,
from infarncy to dotage. Her triumphant
Generals, hownever, in the days of Alex-
ander, had not a single denarius to ipare
upnc~ the luxuries of the East. Tkhe cot-
taes of Evander, in Virgil, of Cinciona-
tus an~d of F~abricius, in Livy, the suppers
and,~ w-ardirobe of Lucullus, the afs-milk
b~athus of Poppoea, and thle golden palace of
N~ero, are all evidences of very different
manniers, and ought not to be jumbled to-
-gether, as affordinig equal expenditure of
Allatic luxuries. T'he poetr Horace makes

mention of francnkincef of perfu~mes, and

meritl~:-~of

of pepper, &c. It isto be oblerved, that,
prior to the time when the poet Horace re-
tirEd from the army, the Romans had made
powerful impre~iTonsupon Afa. The bro-
ther of the great Scipio had acquired the
f~urnarne of Afiaticus ; the legions of Rome
had passed the Euphrates. Is it pofirble,
then, to s~uppos~e, that Augullus, the matter
of Rome, the mithrefs of the world--that
Auguilus who carreffed the wife of his
friend Mecaenas, and who, culm beneficio,
had entered hims~elf heir to so many great
families-that he, the King of the world,
could possibly wrant cinnamon to his cuf-
tard, or pepper to his poached egg, if
Alexander, the forerunner of -Tamer-
Jane, of Ghenghezean, &L·. and w·ho
was quietly inurned 300 years before
the viatory of Agrippa at Acaiumn; if A-
lexander, I fay, had not aded as MLater
Mason at laying the foundation of Alexan-
dria upon the banks of the Nile ? Silk
was not introduced into Europe until the
year 55 I a~fter the Chriflian aera. Surely

Dr -Robertson will not fady, that the ladies
at St James's, the M~ianfon-hodie, and other
-~falhionable resorts, owe their silks to Alex-
ander the Great ? Commerce, or mutual
-exchanges betwixt nations, is founded uponr
an inflina natural to man ; it exiits among
savages, ar~ nd i mlflourifh where people are
free and protea~cd. Hence it is probable,
that nobody admits India Direaors to be a
w~hit wiser than Aldermeni. Commerce
has nothing to do witha the passage of the
Graniicus. Exchanges must have taken
place, alth~ogh Jupiter Ammon, the horn-
ed god of Egypt, hiad never cuckolded the
hlufband of Olympias . The famnous Col-
bert asked the conduaors of woolen fCabrics
at Abbeville, ' WVhat edias~ they wETited to
' hiave eflablifh~ed in their fatvour ?' Th~~eir
answer was wife and remnarkable, viz.

'L~eave

* Phlilip, good mian ! like Aldermecn, in the oldi

E·nglish~ comedy, ~seems to h~ave been contented. N'o
challenige ens~ued, althioughl~ he mig~ht have dic'a~ted one
w~ith as muLch safety as he dicaated to thle Delphk.c
oracle,

# RECAPITULATION.

' Leavle us to ourfelves.' W~e may fagfe-
ly assert, that finance, and national jea-
loufies, are the great obtru~tions to com-
merce, which mu~t flourish where it is free
and prote61ed. If the pafr~ge, for exam-
ple, was safe and free from Athens to Ma-
labar, might not the figs of Attica, and the
works of M~enander, have been exchanged
for cotton fabrics, although Alexander had
not murdered Clitus and Philotas.

I AGRIEE with the hi~oriographer of

Rome, that Alexander wc~ould have been
foiled, had he attempted :he conquelt of
Italy ; conse~quently, he could not Ilave

C: conquered

( 18

conquered the world; and if he could not
conquer, finrely he could not govern what
he had not conquered. Let us not, hiow-
ever, avail ourselves too much of the above
thort, though certain logical conclusion,
Let us view matters more at large. Pro-,
grefive conquests, wif~e eftablilh-ments, a
fucceiron of great men, great armiies, exaRt
discipline, a regular fyfitem, perseverance
fopDerior to the greateRt dif~afers, aff~embies
to a~t as organs of intelligence betwixtr
rulers and people, are circumfrances very
conspicuous, from the days of I omulus to
:he age of the Antonines. Romre might be
compared to a felf-exiftent corporation,
always aauated by the fame fjirit. H-ad
the depended upon a Scipio, or a, Ca-
mnillus, w-e never thould have mzarchedf witll
Agr'ic'ola to the Grampian mount: ins. H-er
armies braved thie burning fuzn of M~auri-
tania; they braved the mountail-s, the fa-
rests, the mairfhes, 3ad the frolts of Ger-

( 1 )

In the hiflory of Alexander, how few

circumstances are to be found similar to
the progress of Rome ? The moment be
died, his empire wras rent in pieces; his
hereditary kingdom passed into the hands
of firangers. He s~urely was inferior to
the gladiator Spartacus, whole views were
honourable, becader they were just. Spar-
t1acus braved Romne ini her zenith ; his dif-
ficulties, and his heroilm, were great. Of all
conquerors and founders, Mlahomet was ei-
ther the wrifeft or the mnof fortunate. The
sword and the altar, no doubt, were con-
dueted by the fame person; but then the
Caliphate passed thirough many dinaffies;
and yet, notwithfianding this apparently
insurmountable difrlculty, the Saracens were
great and rapid conquerors. It is impof-
fible that one man, at the head of one
army, without a powerful principle of fuc-
cefiiion, can ever found a great empire.

In Arrian's focond volume, there is a

chapter entituled!, The great D4esigns of'

Ailexander

Alexander; inwhich no mertibttottwhat-
ever is ma~de of commercie; for this rea;
fEon, inter alia, w~e are warranted to · o'ri-
clude, that Dr Robertson bellows upon his
hero a very fifitiouis virtue when he hol ar
him~ forth as a g~reat commercial founder.
