Bairth of Charles V. .

Charles V. 'was born at Ghent on the twenty.
fourth day of February, in the year one thousand
fiv~e hundred. His: father, Phili~p the H~andsome,
archd~uke of ~Aufria, was tche son of the em-
peror Mlaximnilian, and of M~ary, the only child
of Charl-es the B~old, ~the last prince of .the hous~e
of Burgundy. His mother, Joanna, was the
fcond daughter of FerdinandZ and likbella, kring;
and queen of Caftiile and Aragon,.

His domninions, ranld the events by which he acqulired themr.

A long train of fortunate eveit~s had opened

thbe way for this youmng prince to the inheritance
of more e~xtensive dominiorns , t~ha any European-
Smonarch, since Charlemagne, had poffeffied, Eacht

fleffrons of 1Viary of Bdrg'undy were defitined for
an~other family, the having been contraded by~
h1er father to the' only son of L6uis XI. of
France; but that capricious monarch, indulging
hils hatred to her family, chos~e rathe~r to strip:

daughter, and whom an assembly of the state~s
had acknowledge~d to be thme heir' o~f his kingdom,
they obliged her to retire into Portugal, and
placed Ifabells on the throne -of' Caifkile. Ser-

Ferdinand jealous of P'hilip's powert.

SBut amidst there outward appearances offa-

tisfat~ion and joy, some s~ecret ·uneaiinefs preyed
upon the mind of each of thefb~ princes. The
stately and reserved ceremonial of the Spanis~h
cqu;rt was to burdenfomne to Philip, a prince
yosung , gay3, affable, fond of society and of
pleas~ure, that he ~o~on began tolexpiefs a defitre
of returning· to his native dountry, the man-
ner~s of which were more fauited to his temper.
Ferdinand, obfekrving the~ declining health ors
his queen, with. whose life his r~ight to the
government of Caiftile must -ce~afh, endily forel
saw , that a prince of Philip's` difrpolition, and·

Aragon. Ferd~inan~ld'·s own charafter, with
which the. Caffilians were well -acquainted,
wua~s far from rendering his authority desirable.
Safpicious , .dis~cerning , severe, and parFimto-

rallyr turned tfieir eyes either towrards Ferdi-

former claimed that dignity as administrator
for his daughter, and by virtue of the teaa-
ment of If~iabella; the latter thought himself the
legal guardian of his grandson,, whom., on~acr
count; of his mother's infirmityI, he already con-
iidered na king of Caffile. S-uwh of: the nobili-
ty- as had lately been most aecive in compel,
ling perdinand ~to resign the government of the

reffored to foaon to his former dignity. They!
dreated the return of a rmonarch, not 5apt to
forgive, and who, to thos~e defeas with which
they were already acquainted, added that re-
fea~tment wh~ich thle remembraince of their· be=-
haviour , and r~efle~ian upon his own dirfgace,
roust naturally have excited. T~hough none of
thelp 9bjehtions held agatinft ]Viaximilian, hre
was a ftwanger to the lawvs and m~anners of Caf-
tile; he had not either troops or money to f~irp-
port his preteniions; nor could his claim be
admitted without a public declaration of Joanl
na's incapacity for government, an indignity
to which, notwithffanding the notoriety of her
distemper, the delicacy of the Caftilians could
not bear the thoughts of faijeating her.

with t~he a~dminiftwtation. This jealouLfyC soon
peg~ot avediion, and even hatred, the symptoms
of whiich he wa~s at no pains to conceal. Hence
proceeded his immoderate joy when his.young

life would have deprived Charles of the crowns
of Aragon, N~aples, Sicily , and Sard~inia; and
upon the untimely death of that prince , he
dircovered, for the fame reason , a~n excessive
solicitude to have other children. This impa-
tience hastened , in all probability , the a~ccef-
fxon of Ch3arles to ~the crown· of Spain. Ferdi-
nand, in order tq procure a blefirng, of which,
from his a'dvanced a~ge., and ~the intemperance

recourife (1513.) to his physicians, and by their

are supposed to add vigour to the conultitution,
though they more frequently prove fatal to it.

Ferdinand.

Thoug~h he now def3a~ired of having ~any

s~on of his owzi, his jealaduy of the arehdake
did not abate , nor could he help ~viewing him
with that averflon which princes often bear to
their: facceffbTrs. In oSder to gratify this unna.-
tural pafflon, he made $ will, ( 5 IS.) appoint-
in prince Ferdinand, who having lieen born
and educated in= Sp~ain, was much beloved byr
the Spaniards , to~ be regent of all his king-
doms , until th~e arrival of the ar'chduke his
brother; and by~ the fame deed he fbettled upon
him the grand-mafterfh~ip of the three military
orders. 'I'hej former of those grants migrht have
put it in his power to have difgu~ted the jthrone
with his brother ; the. 14tter would , in anly
event, have rendered hink almoff; independent.

Ferdinand' retained to the last that jealous

love_ of ~power, which ·was to` remark~able
through his whole life. Unw~lling to resign it,
even at 'I~e approach of death, he r~emoved
continually~fitom place to place, in order to fly
from his dilt~emper, or tol forget it. Tholagh
his Atrengthh declined every day, none ·of his
attendants durit mention his condition ;nor
woulde he a~dmi~t h-is fkither confeffr,. who
thought fuchl silence criminal and' unchristian,
into his preience. At last the d~ang~er became
s~o. immt~inent, that it could: be to- longer con-
cealed. FerdinandE receivYed the in~timation with1

a decent fortitude; and touchedj perhaps, ivith
compun~tion at thle injuffice which he had done
hlis grandrfon, or influenced byt the ho~nest re-
monfirsanees of Carvajal, Zapara, and Vargas,
his most ancient and fai~thful counsellors, who.
reptefented to him, that by . inveffing prince
Ferdinand with, the regency, he would infalli-
bly entail a civil war on the two brothersj and

Feridin~iid, infead of that throne of which he
tjhought himf'elf almost secure, an inconfidera-

his genius did not indicate that su~periority which
its maturer age d~ifplalyed k). He did not difr-
cover in his youth that impetuosity of spirit
which commonly uthers in anl a~tive and enter-
prizi'ng manhood. Nor did his early obfequi-
oufnefs to Chievres , an d h~is oth er favourites ,
promise that capacious and decisive judgmemt ,
which afterwards dire~ted the affi~irs of one half
of Europe. But his fab4jeAs, dazzled with the

an enemy to commerce and to regular police,
'e~emed to admit. The~ perf'onal- right-s, and po-
liti-cal inzfluence~, wihich the inhabitants. of th~ese
cities had acqjuired,, were extensive. The royal
prerogative, circuerferibed by the privileges of
the nobility, and by t'he pretenflons of the people,
was confined within very narrow limits. U~nder
such a form of 'gopvernmrielyt, the principles , of
difborsd were many ; the bo~n of union was ex-
tremely feeble , and Spain felt Ir ot only all the
Inconveniencies occaiioned by the defe £t in the
feudal system, but was exposed to difobrders arif-
ing from tne pecuhiarities in its own 'conlf~ix
tution.

During the lrn~g adminiffration ofFerdinand,

no internal commotion, ·It is true, had arisen
in Spain. His superior abilities enabled him to
reitirain the ~turbulence: of the nobles, and to
moderate the jealoufyr of the commons. By.the
yvifdom of his dom-reftic government, by the fa·

gacity with which he conduaed' his foreign
.operations, and by the high opinion that his
fabjeas entertainred of both , he preserved among
thern a degree of tranquillity, greater than was
natural to a coniftitution ,~ in which the feeds of
discord and disorder were t~o copiadfly mingled.
But, by the death of Ferdinand, there reffrains
were at once withdrawn; and fadtian and
discon~tent, from being long repressed, we're
ready to breakt out with fiercer animoity.,

Ferdinand had ayppointed cardinal Ximenes regent.
In order to prevent ~thes~e evils, Ferdinand

had in his last will taken a most prudent prei
cauntion , by appointing cardinal Ximenes, arch=i
bishop of Toledo, to be sole regent: of Castile,
until the arrival of his grandson in Spaip. The
singular charader of this mdn, and the extraori
dinary qualities which marked him .out for that
office at s~uch a jun~ture, merit a particular de-
scrip tion.

His rif~e and charadter.

He was descended of an honourable, not

of a wvealthy fktnily'; and the circumfltance~s of
his parents,; as w~ell as his own inclinations,
having determined him ·to enter ~into the church,
he early obtained benefices of great value, and
which placed him in the way of the highest prei
ferment. A~ll .there, however, he renounced
at once; and after u~ndergoing a very fCevere:

declined wish a firmn~ess, which nothing but the
Authoritative injunftion of the pope was able to
overcome. ~Nor did this height of promotion
change his manners. Though obliged to display
ip public that magnificence whiich became his
station , hethiiniftkf -retained his monastic se~verity.

Untder his pontifical robes he conflantly- wore
thle coarre frocke of St. Francis , th~e rents in, which
he'uifed to patch with his own hbands. He at
no time uf'ed linen; but was cormonly clad in
hlair-cloth. He slept always in his --habit, moiE
frequently on the g~round, or on laeds , rarely;

which appeared at his table, but satisfie-d him-
s~elf with that simple diet which the rule of his
order preferibed.1) Notwit~hfianding there pet
culiarities, so opposit~e to the manners of the
world, he poff~effed a thorough, knowledge of
its affairs; and no sooner was he called by this
flation, and.by the high· opinion which Ferdi.,
asnd and.Ifabella entert~ained of him, to take a
principal share in the administration, than he
displayed talents for bufliners , which rendered
the fame of his wisdom equal to that of his
fan~tity. Bold and original to all his plans, his

and partook both of its virtues and its· defe~ts.

Such wasn the manl to whom Ferdinand com-

niiitted' the regency of Caitile, and though Xi-
menes was then near fourscore, and perfeatly
acqjuainted with t~he labou~r and~ diffiiiiiiiiiiiii~culty of the
office, his natura~l intrepidity of mind , and zeal
for the public good , prompted him to accept ~of
it without hesitation. .Adrian ofUtrecht, who
had been ferit into Spain a few months before
the death of Ferdinand, produced full powers
fromP the arichduke tso assum~e the name and autho-
rityv of regent upon the demise of his grandfather;
but fixch was the averflon of the Spaniards to
thle government of a firanger, and so -unequal
the ~ibilities of the two competitors , tha't Adrian's
·claim would at once have been rejeated, if Xi-
menes himself, from complaisance to his new
mafiter, had not consented to acknowledge him
as regent, and to carry , on the government in
con~jun~tion with him. By this, however, Adrian
arcquired a dignity merely nominal. Ximen~es,

though he treatied hitu.with grerttdecency, and
even refpe&, retained t'he whole power in his
own h~ands. m)

itig been flattered with so near a profpedt of
supreme power, bore the dis~appointment of his
hopes with greater impatience than could have

for his safety, rem~oved him from daadalupe,

HMis s~chemes for extending th~e prersgative.

Ximenes, though poffeffed only ·of delegats-

ed power, which, from his advanced age, he
could ndt expe& to enjoy long,! assumed, to-
gether with the car~aer of regent, all th~e ideas
niatural to a· monarch, and adopted. schemes for
extending "the regal authority, which he pur-
sued with as much intrepidity and ardour, as
if he himself~ had been ·to reap the ad vantages
resulting· from their faccef~s. The exorbitant pri-
vileges of the Castilian nobtles circurnferibedE the
prerogative of the prince within very narrow
limits. There the cardinal considered as t~io ma-.
ny unjuff extortions fr~om the crown, and de-
termined to reduce t'hem. Dangerous as the
attempt was, there were" circumftanes in his
situation, which promnifed him. greater faccefs
·than any king of Castile could have expeded.
His fkriac and prudent ceconomyr of his archi~epi-
fcopal revenues, furnished him with more rea-
dy money than the cro~wn coul~d at~ any time
command; the f'ancity ·of his manners, his cha-
rity and munificence, rendered him the idol of
the people ; and the nobles th~ems~elves , not:
fufpe.Bing any danger from him, did not obe
serve his motions with the ifaLme jealous atten-.
tion, as they would have' watched thos~e of one
of their monarchs.

By deprefiling the nobility.

Imlrediattely upon his acceffron to~ the re-

gency, f~ieveral of the nobles, fancying that the
reins of government would of confeuquence be
somewhat relaxed, began to affernble their vas-
f~als,· and to prosecute, by force of arms, pri-
vate quarrels and pretensions, which the autho-,
rity ofFerdinand had obliged them to dissemble,
or to relinquish. But Ximenes, who* had taken
into pay a good body of troops, opposed and
defeated All their designs with unexpedted vi-
gour and facility; and though he did not treat
the authors of the~re diford e~with any cruelty,
h~e-forced thern to aats of ~iffon, extremely
mortifyin g to the haughty spirit of Ca~ftiian
grandees.

By forming a body of troops depending on the crown.
But wcEhile the cardinal's attacks werer con-

:fined to individuals, and every aRt of rigour
was juffified by the appearance of necessity ,
founded on the forms of juffice, and tempered
with a mixture of lenityr, there was fecarcely
rooma for jealousy or complaint. It w~as not so,
with his next measure , wvhich,- by firikringr at:
a privilege effekntial to the nobility, gave a ge-
neral alarm to the whole order. By the feudal
constitution, the military power was lodged in
the hands of the nobles, and ften of an inferior
condition were called into the field only as their
vassals, and to follow their banners. A king

with f'canty revenues, and a limited prero~gz-
tive, depended on there potent barons in all
his operations. It was with their forces he
attacked his enemies, and( with them he defend-
ed his own kingdom. W'hile at thie head of
troops attached warmly to their own lords,
and accustomed to obey no other commands,
his authority w~as precarious, and his efforts
feeble. From this state Ximnenes resolved to
deliver the crowin , and as mercenary standing
armies were unkno~tyn u~ndetr the feudal go-
vernment, and w~ould have bega odious to a
Inartial and generous people, he issued a pro-
clamation, com sIing5 every city in Caffile to
enroll a certain betr of its burg~efies, lin or-
der that they might be trained to the afe· of
arms on Sundays and holidays; he engagred to·
proid'e offcers to command them at the pulblic
expence-; and as an enco~uragem-ent to the pri-
vate men, promised them an exern'ptian from
all taxes. and Impositions. The~ frequen~t incur,
fions of the MEoors f~.rom Africa, and the necef~-
fity of having· fame force ready to o-pp~ose them,
furnis~hed a plausible prete~nce for this innova-
tioti. The objeft really in view wa~s to s~ecure
the kring a body of teroops i~ndepenrdent of his
barons, and-.·whichl might ~serve to coundterba-1

tually th~e scheme which he had adopted woulld
accomplib his end ; but as a mneatlre which had
the pious ap~pearance of resisting the progres~s of'
the infidels was extremely popular, and as any
opposition to it arising from their order alone,
would have been imputed whlolly to interefied
motives, they enldeavoured to excite the cities
thems~elves to refuite obedience , and to remon-
fIrate against the proclamation, as inconsistent
with theirs charters and privileges. In confe-
quence of their inftigations, Burgos, Vallado-
lid, and several other cities, ros~e in open mu-

their proteEtors. Violent remon firances were
pres~ented to the king. His Flemith counsellors
were alarmed. Ximnenes alone continued firmu
and undaunted; and parety by terror, partly by
intreaty; by force in fomne instances , and by
forbearance in others, he prevailed on all the
refra~tory citles to comply. s) During his ad-
miniff ration , he continued to. execute 'his plan
w uith vig~our; but soon after his death it was en-
tirely dropt.

had annexetd thema to their owa ·estates. The:

lands, were extremlely defe~tive; it was from
fome' faccefsful aUurpation7, whichE~ the crown
had been too feeble to dispute, .tha~t: rany de-
rived their only title to p-offeffon: An enquiry

have firipped every nobleman in Spain of great.
part-of his lands, it muff have excited a. gene-
r~al revolt. .Such a sk~ep was too bold, even for
the enterprizing genius ~of Ximenes. He con-
fined himself to the rei~gn of Ferdinand; and be-
ginnimg with the penfdons grante~d during that
time, refused to make any fairther.patymenti be-
cause all right to them expired with his life.
He thien called to account such as had ac~quired
crown lands under the; administration of that mo-
narch , and at once refa~med whatever· he had
alienated. The effe~s of t'hefe revo'cations ex-

Stended to many pers~ons of high rank; for though

F'erdinand was a' prince of little generosity ,
yet he and Ifkbella having been raised to the
throne of Castile by a powerful fa~tion ofthe

nobles, they were obliged to reward the zeat
of their adherents with great: liberality, and thec
royal demefnes wer~e their only fund for that
purpoele The addition made to the revenue of
the crown by there revocations, together with
his own frugal ceconomy, enabled Ximenes not
only to dlfchargee all the debts which Ferdlinand
had left, and to remit considerable faums to Flan-
ders, but to pay the -officers of his new militia,
and to establish mag$azines more numerous, and
better furnithed with artillery, armst and war-
like stores, than Spain had ever poffeffred in ally
former age. t) The prudent and disinterest-ed
application of these faxms, was a full apology
to the people for the rigour with which they
wiere exadted.

The nob~les oppofre his meaf'ure~s;

The nobles, alatrmed at therfe repeated at-

tacks, began to think of precautions for the fia-
fety of their order. M'any cabals were formed,
load complaints were uttered, and desperate re-
solutions taken; but before they proceeded to
extremities,. they appointed some of thleir numa-
bers to examine the powers in consequence of
which the cardinal exercised a~ts of such high
authority. The admiral of Caffile, the duke de
Infantado , and th/e Cond6 de Benevento, gran-
dees of the first rank , were entrafted* with this
commission. Ximenes received themn with cold

duced the teftamnent of Ferdinan~d by which he
was appointed regent, together with thle rati-
fication of that deed by Charles. To both there
they objeded; and he endeavour~ed to effablifhz
their validity. As the convrerf'ation grew warm,
he led th~em infeatibly towards a balcony, ·from
which they had a view of a. large ~body of troops

wiho, might circumferibe their power, than as a
miniRer, who by his prudence and vigour was

matter. EvJery complaint againfr his adminiftra-
tio32 was listened to with pleasure by the courtiers
in the Low Countries. Unnece~ary obstructions
were thrown by their means in the way of all
his meafaures; and though they could not , ei-
ther with decency or safety, deprive hitn of the
o~ffce of regent, they endeavoured to lessen his
authority by dividing it. They soon dis~cov~ered
th~at Adrian of Utrecht, already joined with hinx
in office, had neither genaius nor spirit fuffi-
-clent to give the least check to his proceedings;
and therefore Charles, by their advice , added

by thie artifices and intrigues of the Flemit'h
miniffers, had the burden of two, foreign wars
to fuxpport. , The one was in Navarre, invaded
by its unfortunat'e monarch , John d'Albret.
The death of Ferdinand, the absence of Charles,
the dis~cord and difaffie~tion which reigned azmong
the Spanish nobles, s~eemed to present him with
a favourable opportunity of recovering his do-

minins.The cardinal's vigilance, however,

defeated a meas~ure Ib wel~l concerted. As he
~foresaw the danger to which thlt: kingd~om might

be expyofed, on~e of his firkt a~ts ofadminiffration
was to order thither a considerable body of troops.
While the ksing was employed with one pai-t of'
his army in the fiegre of St. J.ean Pied en Por t,
Villalva , an ofhecer ofgreat experience and
coura~ga, attacked ·the. other by furpriae, and
~cut it to pieces. The king instantly retreated
with precipitation, and an- end' was put to the
war x). But -as Navarre was filled at that time
wiith towns -and caffles slig~htly fortified, and·
weakly g-arrisoned , which being unable to resist
an enemy, served only to furnmif him with
places, of retreat; MfimenesJ always bold and.
decisive in his meas~ures, ordered everyi one of
there to be difmnantled, except Pamnpeluna, the
fortifications of wihich h~e p~roposed to render
very fkrong-. To this uncommon precaution
Spain owes the poffeffron of Navarre. 'the
French, fxnce that period, have often entered,
and have as often overrun the open country;.
while they wer~e exposed to all the inconviniene
cies attending an invading army, the Spa~niards
have ealily drawn troops from the neighboutringr
provinces to oppose t'hemn; and th~e Ftrench,
being destitute of fkrong towns to whfe~th they
could retire, have been obliged to abandon
their con~queRt with as much .ra~pidity as they
gained it.

Corruption of the Flemith minilers, partilcularly of Chievres.

This dif~afer was f'oon forgotten ; while the

condu~t of the Flemnith court proved the cause
of constant uneafxnefs, not only to the cardinal
but to the whole Spanish nation. All the great
qualities of Chievres, the prime minister and
favouarite of the young king, were sullied with
an -ignoble and sordid avarice. The accession
of his master to the crown of Spain, opened a

new and copious foure for the gratification of
this paflon. During· the time of Charles's re-
iidence in Slanders, the whole tribe of preten-
ders to offices or to favour resorted thither. They
soon discovered that, without the patronage of
Chievres, it was vain to hope for prefermnent;
'nor did they 11rant fatgacityi to find out the pro-
per method of securing his prote~tion. Vast
sams of money were drawn out of Spain. Every
thing was venal, and dispos~ed of to, the highest
bidder. After the extemple of Chievres, the
inferior Flemil'h ministers engaged in this traf-
sick, which became as general and avowed,
as it was infamous. z) The Spaniards were
~filled wvith .rage when they beheld officies of
great importance to the we~lfare of their court-
try , s~et to sale by firangers, unconcerned for
its honour or its happiness. XYimenes,. difin-
terefied in his wvhole adminiffration, and az
fkranger, from his native grandeur of mind,
to the paffl~on oi' avarice, inveighed with the
utm~ost boldness against the venality of the Fle-
min7gs. He reprefeated to the king, in firong
terms, the murmurs' and indignation whicht
their behaviour excited among a free and high-
spirited people, and besought him to set out
without 10fs of time for Spain, that, by his
presence, he might dillipate the clouds which
were gathering all over the kingdom a).

Chi.arles perflunded by Xi~menes to visit: Spain.

Charles was fully sensible that he had delayed

too long to take poffefiron of his dominions in
Spain. Powerful obsta~cles, however, flood in
%is way, and detaihed him in the Low Coun,
tries·. The avar which the league of Cambray
had kindled in Italy , Aill fublifed; though.
durieng is cours~e, the armies of all the parties
engaged in it had changed their detiit-ation and
their obje~t~s. France was now in alliance with
Venrie , whichi i~t had at first combinled to
deffroy. IMaxcimili'an and Ferdinand had~ for
some y~ears carried on hoffilities against France,
their original ally, to the valour ofwhof~e troops
the confederacy had been ind~ebted for all its
fu~ccefis. Together with his kingdoms,. Ser*
dinand ·transmitted this war to his grandson;
and there wa~js reason to eixpe~t that Mlaximilian
always fond of new enterprizes, would perun-
de the young monarch ,to enter into it With
ardour. But the Flemings, who ha~d long pof-
f'effeid an exfenfive cori'merce, which, during
the league of Cambrayl had grown to a great
height, upon the ruins of the Venetian trade,
dreaded a rupture with France; and Ch~ievres ,
sagacious to discern the true interest of his coun-
try, and not warped on this occasion by his
love of wealth , warmly declared for main-
ta~ining peace with th~e French nation. Francis
I. defl-itute of allips, and folicitous' to s~ecure?
his late conquests in Italy by a treaty, listened

-with joy to the first overtures of aomodation.
Chievires himfielf condulted the neg·ociation in
-namne of Charles. Gouffier appeared as pleni.
-potentiary for Francis. Each of them had pre-
sided over the education of the prince whom he
represented. They had both adopted, the ~fame
·pacific fyit~em; and were equally pers~uaded that:
'the union of the ~two monarchs wvas the happiest
event for themselves, as well as for their king-
doms.

A peace concluded w~ith France. Aug. I3. Igr6.

In s~uch hands the negoeiation did not lanr-

guif~h. A few days after opening their con-
ferences at Noyon, they concluded a treaty of
-confederacy and mutual defence between the
.two monarchs; the chief articles in which we-.
re, that Francis tChould give in mazrriage to
Charles his eldest daughter, the princes~s Louif'e,
an infant of a year old, and as her dowry,
thoutld make over to him all his claims and pre-
tensions upon the kingdom of Naples; that, in
consideration of Charles s being already in pof-
femron of NTaples, he tfhould, until the accom-
plifh~ment of the marriage,. paiy an hundred thiou-
sand crowns a year to the French king; and t-he
·half of tihat fixm annually, as long as the prin-
ce rs had no childuren; that wvhen Charles Ch all
arrive in Spain, the heirs of the king of Na-
varre may represent to him their right to that

hingdom; anid if it do no give them fatishfaion,
Francis thould be at· liberty to adift them with
all his forces. b) This alliance not, only unit-
ead Cartles and Francis, but\ oblig~ed Mraximi~-
lian, whofj wa8s uhable alone to cope with the
;French and Venetians, to enter into aS treaty
with those powers, which put a, fnal period
to the bloody anld .t~edious war that the league
of Cambray had occaiioned. Europe enjoyed.
a few years of universal trnquillity, and was
indebted for that blefirng· to twoa princes, w~fhofe
rivalfhip and amrbition kept it in perpetual d'if-
cord andi agitattion durinlg the remainder of their
reigns.

·The Flemnings averse to Charles's vilit to S~pain.
By the treaty of Noyon, Charles fecureid

a safe paflage into Spain·. It: was not, howiie-
ver, the interest of his Flemitih miniff~ers, that
he. thould visit that king~dom foun. While he
refidedf in Slanders , the revenues of the Spanish
crown were fpenlt there, and t~hey engronKed,
without any competitors, all the effekAs of their
monarch's generosity; their country became the
feat of government~, and all ~favours were dif-
penfed by them. OFall thef'e advantages they run
the rifqule of f~ieeing themf'elves deprived,- from
the moment that their fevereigrn entered Spain.
The Spaniards would naturally assume the~ di-
re~tion of thei~r own- affairs; thie Lo w Countries

would be confidiered only as a province of tha~t
migrhtcy monarchy, and the~y who nowy diftrfi-
buted the favours of the prince· to others, must
then be contents to receive them from the hands
of ft ran ger s.

Afraid of Ximeces.

But what Chiievres chiefly withed to avoid

was, an interview between the king and XJi-
menes. On the one hand, -the wifdomn, the
integrityi, and the magnanimity of that: prelate,
gave him a wonderful afeendant over the minds
of men; and it wa7s extremely~ prozbable, that
thiefe gr~1eat qualities, atdded to the reverence
due to hIs age and office, wuould com~mand the
refpec2 of a young prince, whoi0 ,caIpable of
noble and generous fentitnents himlelf, would,
in proportion to his admiration of the cardina~'s
virtues, leflen his deference towvrards verfonrs of
another charad~er. Or, on the other hand, if'
Charl~es thouldhallow~~~iii~~~iii~~ his Flemrith fa~vourite to
retain all thle influence over his coulncils wiihich
they at pre'e~nt poirefed ; it was eafyT to foresee
that th~e cardinal would remonstrate loudly
agrainlf fixch an indignity to the Spanich nation,
and vindicate the rights of his country with
th7e famne intrepidit~y and faccefs, that he had
aff'erted the prerogatives of the crown. For
these reaf'ons, all his F~lemii~th counsellors com-
blned to retard his departure, and Charles,
unfuftpidious, from want of experience, and

sand of his native country, f~uffered himfrelf to
be unnece~ssarily detained in thie Netherlands a
whiole year after signing the treaty of Noyon.

Charles embarks for Spain. Is1t,

The repeated enitrei;ties of Ximenes, the

advice of his, grandfather Maxim-ilian, and the
impatient murmurs of his Spanish f~ubjefts, pre-
vailed on haim at last to embajrk. H)e was at-
tended not only by Chievres, his prime minis-
ter, but by a numerous and splendid train. of
the Flemith nobles , fond of beholding the gran-
dear, or of Chlarin~g in the bounty of their
prince. After adangerous voyage, he landed
·at Villa Viciofa, in the province of Affurias,
(Sept. 23.) and was received with such loud ac-
clamations of joy, as a n~ew monarch, whose
·arrival was to atrdently· deilred,, had reason to
expe61. The Spanish nobility res~orted to their
fevereign from all parts of th~gykingdom, and
displayed a ~magnificence which the Fleming~s
were unable to emulate. c)

inffrm state of his health would permit, in order
to r'eceive him.~n During his regency, and not-
withstanding his extreme old agez, he had abated,
in adi degree, the rigour or frequency of his
mortifications; and to there he added such la.-
.borious assiduity in business, as would have worn
o iut the moss youthful and vigorous constitution.
Every day he employed several hours in devo-
tion; he celeb~rated mafa in pers~on; he even
allotted some i'pace for ffudy. NMotwithianding·
these pccupations, he regularly attended the
council; he received and read all papers pre~sent-
ed to h3im; he dietated letters and in~ftru~ions;
and took under his infpe~tion all business, civil,
ecclefinfticazl, or military. Every mnoment of
his time was filled up with some s~erious emrploy-
.ment. The only amuf'ement in which he in-
dulged himself, by way of relaxation after bu-
finefs, was to canvas~s , with a few ~fria~rs and di-
vines, some intricate article in fcholaftick theology.~
Wasted by such a course of life, the infirmities
of age daily grew upon him. On his journey,
a violen-t disorder s~eized him at Bos Equillos,
attended with uncommon symptoms; which hris
follow~ers considered as th·e effe~ft of pois~on d),
but could not ag~ree whether the crime ought to
be imputed to the hatred of the Spanrifh nobles,
or to the malice of thre Flemith courtiers.

Charles's ing~ratitude to Xinteneir.

This accident obligi~ng him ~to stop Iflort,

he wrote to Charles, and wvith hi~s af~zial boldnefire~~~e
advited h1imn to difrinis all2 the ir~angera i7n his
train, whose numribers and criedit gave off'ence
alreadly to the ·Spaniirds, and would ere long
alienate the afi-e~ions ofE~ the whole people. At1
the fame time he: earnestly desired to have :an
interview with the king, tha~t ~he mhight infor tn
him of the Sftate of thel3ation, -a-nd the t~emper
·of h~is f~ubjeffs. To prevent this,: not on~ly the
Fleminlgs, but th~eSpanif~h grand~ees, employed
all their addres~s,. and indtxfrioufly kept Charl'es
at a aiftanc~e from Alranda , the place to which
the cardinal had removed. Through their' fug·-
geftions, every m~eaare that he recommended
was rejetted; the utmoff care was taken to make
him i'eel, and to point out to .the whole nation,
that his power' was o~n ' the decline; even in
things purely trivial, such a~ choice- was a~lways
afte, as was deemed most disagreeable to him.
Xi~menes did not bear this treatment wcith- his
afbal fortitude of spirit. 'Confcious of his own
integrity~ and merit , he expeaed a more grate-
ful return from a prince to whom: he delivered
a kingdom more flourithing thanm it had beeji in
any former age, together with auth~ority more
extenlive and better efkablifhed, ,than the m'bft
illuitrious of his ancestors had ever poffeffed.
He could not, therefore, on many occasions,

yAfrain from Igi~ving vrent to his indignation and
complaints., He lamented ~the fate of his country,
and foretold the calamities whbich it wouldwfuffer
from the insolence , the rapaciousne~ss, and
ignora-nce of firangers. W~hile his mind was
a~gi~tatedl by th~ere pat~ions, he r~eceived a letter
firom the king, in wchich, after a few cold ami
f'ormal exprefilons of regard, he wans allowced2
to -retire to h~is dioceire; that after a lif'e of falchi~
-continued labour, he might end his day~s in
tranquillity.

h~aaghty mind , it: isprobabl-e, would not survive

hear the profpeRt of the moisfortunes ready to

the grandeur , and .the faccefs of his schemes,
<luring a regency of o~nly twenty months , leave
it doubtfuli, whether his sa~gacity in council,
his prudence in co~ndrsxft, or his boldness in exe-

but for fan~tity; and he is the only prime inli-

Charles made his publick entry, with greatpomnp,
into Vallad~olid, wvhither he had s~ummo~ned the
Cortes of Castile. Though- he aiKumre~d on .all
occasions the name of liin~g, th'at: title had never
been acknowledged in thie dortes. The Span~iards
considering Joanna as poflefed of the -Tole right
to the crown, and nlo example of a f~on's having;
enjoyed the title of king during the life of his
parents occurring In ·their hiss ory , the Cortes
dii'covered all that ferupulous refpe& for anienrt

fyrnptoms of diffa8tisfadtion with his government
began" to break out in thre kingdom. Ch~ievres
had acquired over the mind of the young mo-
aarch the af'cendant not only of a tutor, but of
a parent. Charles seemed to have no fentimnents
bu~t those w~hich his minister inspired , and fear-
cely uttered a word but what he put into his
mouth. He was constantly surrounded by Fle-
mings; no person got access to him without
their perraifflon; nor was any admitted to au.
dience but in their pres~ence. As he s~poke the
Spanifh.1!anguage very imp~erfe~tly , his anfwvers
were alwtay~s extremely short, and often de-
li eredk with hesitation. From all there circumn-
ft nees, many of the Spaniards were led to be-
lie~ve that he was a prince of a flow and narrow
g~enius. Some pretended to discover a strong re-
femblDance between him and his mother, and
began to wIhifper that his capacity for govern-
twent would never be far f'uperior to ~hers; and'

Dqeath of the emperor Maxim~ilian, January 12. 15Ia.

Soon after Charles's arrival at: Barcelorna,

he. received the account of an event which in-
terefted him much more than the: murmurs of-
the Caftilians, or the feruples of the Cortes of
C~atalonia. This was the death of the emperor-
~Maximilian; an occurrence of fmnall importance
in itself, for he was a prince corifpicuous nei-
ther for his virtues, nor his power , nor his
abilities; but rendered by .its consequences
more memorable than any that had happened
during several ages. It broke that profound
and universal peace whichi then reigned in the
Christian world; it excited a rivalfhip between
two princes, whlich threw all Europe into agi-
tation, and kindled wars more general, and
of longer duration, than had hitherto been
known in m~odern times.

The revolutions occafianed by the expedi-

tion of the French king, Charles VIII. into
Italy, had inflpired the European princes wIith
new ideas concerning the imaortance of the
imperial dignity. Th~e claimrs of the empire
upon fomne o'f the Italian slates were numerous;
its jurifdiftion over others was extensive; andi

and to the r~ights in rent in the office., which?·

1VMaximilian had endeavoured to facure .tfhe Imhperial~ crown to;

hijs grandfby,

Not long before his death, Mallximilian had

daifcovered great solicitude to preserve this dig-
nity in the Auffriana family, and to procure the
king of Spain to be chof'en his facceffor. But
hp hims~elf~ having.-ever been erowned by the.
pope, a -ceremony deemed eflbntial in that age,
was coniideredr only as emperor ele~t. ·' Though·

confer this honour upon Francis I. the sovereign
.of a people whoife genius, laws, and man-

mans, that it -was hardly polible .to effablif~h
any cordial uanion between t~h~em ;; he trufked
not it little to the effedt~ of Maximtilia~n's nego-
ci~ations, which, though t~hey .·did- not attain
their end, had prepared the minds. of the Ger-
matns for his elevation to the Imperial throne;
but what he relied on as a chief recommnenda-
tion, was the fortungte fxtuation of his, h'eredi-,
tary dominions in~ Germany, which served as
a natural barrier to the empire against tche en-
croachments of the Turkit~h power. The con-
queits, the abilities, and the ambition of Sul-
tan Selim II.. had spread over Eurxope, at: that:
time, a general and well found~ed alarm. By
his viatories over the Mamalukes, and the ex-
tirpation of that gallant body of men, he had
not only added Egypt and Syria to his empire,
but had Eecured to it such a degree of internal
tranquillity, tha~t he was ready to turn against:
Christendo~m the whole fbree ofhis arms, which
nothiing hitherto had been able to resist. · The
mott ·effeatual expedient for flopping the pro-
g~rets of this torrent, f~eejned to be the eleftion

of aq emperor, poffefifed of extensive territories
in th~t country, where its first imprefiion would
be felt, and who, besides, could comb at this
formidable enemy with all the forces of a pow-
erful monarchy, and with all the wealth fur-
nifhed by the mines of the new world , or th~e
commerce of the Low Countries. There were
the arguments by which Charles publickly sup-
ported his claim ; and to men of integrity and
refleaion, they appeared to be not only plau-
fible but convincing. He did not, however,
trafit the Aiiccef~s of his cause to thnefe alone.
Great films of money were remitted from Spain;
.all the refinements and artifice of negociation
were employied ; and a considerable body of
troops, kept on foot -by the Rcates of the Circle
of Suaibia, wvas f~ecrletly taken into his pay.
The venal were gained by presents ; the ob-
jedtions of the more ferupulous were anfwaered
or eluded; fomne feeble pr-inces were threatened
and overawed. q)

Of France.

On the other hand, Francis f'upported his

claim with equal eagerners, and no -less con~fi-
dence of its being well founded. His emiffa-
ries con~tenlded that it was now high time to
convince the princes of the house of Auffria
that the Imperial crown was eleftive, and not

entertained against him as a foreigner·, unaci
quainted with the German language or man-
ners, endeavoured to- overcome there, and to
gain the favour of the princes by immense gifts,
and by infiniite promises. As the expeditious
metthod of tranfinitting money, and the decent
mode of conveying a bribe, by bills of exchange,
was then little knmown, the French ambaf-
fadors travelled with a train of horses loaded
with treas~ure, an equipage not very honourable

to a proper diffribution and balance of poiver
wre~re tso lately introduced into the· iTyiem of
European policy, that they were not hitherto
obje~ts of fufficient ,attention. , The pafflrons of

·and the fear of giving` offence to the candidates,
hindered such a salutary uLnion of the powers~
of Europe , and rendered them etither totally
negligebt of the publick safety, or kept themt

seated on the Imperial throne, were prompted,
however, by their hatred of the French nation,
to give an open preference, to the pret~ensions
of Charles , wuhile they uted their utmost in-
fluence to fruffratte those ~of Francis. t)

Of the Venetians.

The Venetians easily dikcerned, that it was

the interest of th~eir republic~k to have both the

los Austria, whose ambition and neighbourhood
had been fatal to their grandeur , wrould not
permit them to a&t up to their own ideas, and.
led thern hastily to give the fanffion of their
approbation to the claim of the French k~ing.

Of Henry VHI.,

It was eq~ually thIe interest , and tmore in

thle power of Henry VIII. of England, to pre-
vent either Francis or Charles froail acquiring a
dignity which would raise them so far above
o~ther monarchs.; But though Henry often boast-
ed, that he held the balance of Europe in his
hand, he had neither the fleady attention, the
accurate discernment , nor the difpaffironat-e
temtper which thiat delicate -fuzn~ion- requiredt~
On this occaffon it mortified his vanity f6 much,
to fee himself excluded from that noble compe,
tition which refleated foch honour upon the
twyo anltagonifts, that he took a res~olution of
sending an ambassador into Germany, and of
declaring hrimfelf a candidate for the Impecrial
throne. The ambaff'ador, though loaded with
ca~resses by the German princes and the pope's
nuncio , informed his mnafer , that he .could
hope for no success in a claim which he had
been so late in preferringr. Henry, imputing
his disa8ppointment to that circumffance alone,
and soothed with this ostentatious display of
ahis own importance, seems to have taken no

fif~rther part in tht mnattel , either by colitri-
hrtfing to thizvart bToth his rivals, or to promote-
one of them; tx)

Views of the Eledors.

Notwithflandin~g th~e artful arguments~pro-

.duced by the ambassadors of the two kings in

Sfa~vour~

favour of their refpedfive masters, and 16 spite
of all their folicitationis, intrigues, and pres~ents,
the elec~ots did not forget that maxim on wrhich
the liberty of the German conflitution was
Ithought to be foun~ded. Among the tnember~s
of ·the Germanick bod~y, w~hich Is a great re-
publick compos~ed of states almost independent,
the first principle of patriotism is to depress and
limit the p~ower of the Emperoii; and of this
fidea, to naturali under fath' a form of govern-
mert,~ a German politician seldom loses fight.
No prince of considerable power, or extensive
dominions, had for some ·ages been raised to
the Imperiial throne. I'o this prudent precau-
tion m~any of the great families in G~ermany
owed the f~plendoxtr and independence w~hich
they had acquired during that period. To eled~
either of the contending mnonairchs, would been
a gros~s violation of thiat faluatry maxim; would
have given to the Empire a master, instead of
an head; andi would have reduced themselves
fr~om the rank of equals, to the condition of

objeft, which mnonarchs,· Eo As -uperior to him

after deliberating ·upon the matter a thort time,
he reje~ted i~twith4 magnalittdity and diiinteref-
tednefs, no left :Argntitar than admira~ble. Not-
thing, he observed, could be more impolitick,
t·han atr obftinaitle adherence to a maxim which,
though found and just in many eases, was not
applicable to all. ;In times of trnqullityi,:· fid
he, · we with for arr-Emperor who has not
power to invade our liberties; times of danger
demhand one who Isl able to fee~ure our f~afe'ty.
The Turkish armies, led by a gallant and vic-
torio~us monarch, are now assembling. They
are ready to pbur in upon Germany with 'a-
violence unknown in former ag~es. New con-
~un~twres call for new expedients. The Im-
perial feeptre must be committed to some and
mr~ore powerful than mine, or that of any other
German prince. We ponffes neither d'ominions,
nor revenues, nor authority which enable as to
encounter such a fo~rmidable enemy. Recourse
must be had in this exigency to 'on-e ~of the rival
mionarchs. ]Each of them can bring in to -th a
field forces rcfuficient for .our defence. But as
the -king of Spain is of German extrci~ion; as
he is' a member ·and prince of the empire by
·the territories which descend to him from his

.grandfather; as his dominions firetch along
`:"at frontier which lies mxoft: exposed to the

enemy; his claun Is pr~eferable, in my opunion,
tlo -that of a stranger to our languaage, to our
blood, and to our country; and therefore I give
my vote to confer on him the Imperial crown.

And refuses any present froin Charles's almbarfadors.

This opinion , di~tat~ed by such uncommon

generofit'y, and supported by argumentS to plau-
Aible, made a deep imnpreflion on the Ele~tors.

Important f'erviee which Frederick had done their
master, sent him a, considerable faum of money',
as the fidt2 tokren of that prince's gratitude. B~ut'

difdlained to receive a bribe; and upon their

They' are: apprehensive of his power, and t~ake precautions

But though the E~ledtors consented, from

various motives, to promote Charles to that
'high flation, they discovered a~t the famne time
great jealousy ocf his extraordinary power, and.
endeavour~d , wsith the uttmoft solicitude, to
provide againit his encroaching on the privileges

promise that he would never violate them in any
inita-nce. While princes, who were formidable
neither ·from extent of territory, nor,of gen'ius,
poffeffed the Imperial throne, a general and ver-
'bal engag~ement to this-purp~ofe was. deemned: faf-
ficient s~ecurity. But uander an Emiperor fb powyer-
ful as Charles, other precaut~ions seemed ·necef-
fary. A Capitulation or claim of-righlt was
formed, in· which the privileges and imm~uni-
ties of the Eledtors, of the princes of the em-
pire, of the cities, and of every othrer member
of the Germanick body are enumerated. This
capitulatioin was immediately signed by. Char-
les's amnbaffadors in the na-me of thieir master ,
and he himself, at his coronation, confirmed i~t
in the moss Edlemn manner. Since that period,
the Eledtors have continued to preferibe the famne
conditiiony~ to all his ifucceffors; anid the Capitu-
lation, or mutual contra&t between the Emperor
and his fubje~ts, is confidef~ed in Germany as
a firong barrie~r ag~airift the progr'efs- of the ImI-
perial power, and as the great charter of their
liberties, to which they often appeal. e)

The elet~ion notified to Charrl~s.

Trhe important intelligence of his ele~tion

was conveyed in mine days from Frankfort to
Barcelona-, where Charles was still detained by

the obstinacy of the Cataloniadn Cortes, which
had nzot hitherto brought to an --ifue aniy of the
afiairs whrich came before ~it. He received the
accousnt. with the joy natural to a young and
aIfpiring mind, on an acceilion of power and di-
gunity which raised him so far above the other
princes of Europe. Then it was that those vast
profpeas which allured him during his whole
adminifkration began to open, and from this aers.
we may date the formation, and are a~ble to
trace ~the g~radual prog~ress, of a grand system
of enterprizing ambition , which renders the
Ihiftory of his reign to worthy of attention.

Its eff~iec? upon him,

A trivial circumstance frirt discovered the

affehas of this great elevation upon the mind of
Charles. In all the publick writs wrhich he
if3ued as king of Spain, he afunmed the title of
. Majesty, and required it from hris fu~bjeats as a
mark of their refpedt. Before that time, all the
monarchs of Europe were thtisfied with the ap-
pellation of Highness, or Gra~ce; but the va-
nity of other 'courts soon ·led th~em to imitate the
example of the Spanish. The epithet of Mn-ajefty
.is no longer a mark of pre,-eminence. The most
~inconside-rable monarchs in Europe ~enjoy it,
and th~e arrogairce of the greater potentates has
invented no higher denomination, d)

The Spapiards di~latisfied with this event.

The Spaniards were far from v~iewing the

promotion of their king to the Imperial throne
with the \fame fhtisfa~ion which he himfkef felt,
To be deprived of the pretence of the~ir fove3,
reign, and to be faubjeaed to the governme~nt
of a viceroy and his couneil, a species of adlmi-
niftration often opprellive, and always difa,
greeable , were the immediate and neceffryrS
consequences - of this new dignity. T~o fee thtt
blood of their countrylren thed inquarrels wyherei
in the nation had no concern;- to bheh~old its
treafaures wasted in fuxpporting the splendour of
a. foreign title; to be plun~ged in thje cha~os of
Italian and German politics, were effebas of this
even t almost as un avoidable. Fro~m all t~h er
confideratiois , they conrcludled , that nothing
could haee happened more pernicious to the .
Spianifh nation; and the fortitude and publick
spirit of the~ir anikeffors, who, in the Cortes of
Castile, prohibited· Alphonzo the WBife from leav-
ing the kringdom , in order to rece~ive the Im-
perial. crown, were oft~en mentioned with the
highest praise, and pronounced to be ex'tremely
worthy of imitation a~t this junRur e. e)

ments~ or murmurs of his Spanith fubjeais, ac-
cepted (Noverber.) of the Imperial dignity whicp

and declared· his intention of setting out soon
for Germany, in order to take pol~eftion of it.
T~his was the more neceilary, because, ac~cord-
ing to the forms- of the German conflitution,
he could riot, before the ceremony of a publickr
coronation, exercise any ae of jurifdi~tion or
authority. f)

Their discontent increatePs.

Their certain knowl~edge of this refolfution

augmented· so much th~e difgaft of the Spaniards,
that: a sullen and refradory spirit prevailed
among persons of all ranks. The Pope havring·
g~ranted the king the tenths of all ecclefixaftical
benefices in Castile to assist him in carrying on
war with greater vigour againftL the Turks, a
convocation of the clergy unanimouly3 refused
to levy that fuzm, upon pretence that it ought
never to be exaded but at those times when
Chriffendomn was gaually invaded by the I~nfi-
diels; and though Lea, in order to s~upport hiis
authiorityI, laid th~e kingdom under an interdia,
so little 'regajrd was paid to a centure which was
universally deemed unjust, that Charles himself
applied to have it taken of. Thus the Spanish
clergy,4l-efides their merit: in opposing the ufixr-
pations of the Pope, and difgarding the in-fluence
of the crow~n, gain~ed the exemption whicb th~ey
had claimed. g)

Its progress Isso.

At the f~ame time the people made choice

ofE deputies to represent their grievances, and.
to implore the proteecion of their sovereign.
Happily for the latter, they arrived at court
when Charles was exefperated to an bigh degree
ag~ainit the nobility. As he was eager to. visit
Germany, where his presence became every
day more necefrTary, and as his Flemith cour-
tiers were still more impatient to return into
their native country, that they might carry
thith~er the s~poils which they had amass~ed in
Castile, it was impoffiible for him to hold the
Cortes of Valenciaa in person. He had for that
reason empowered the cardinal Adrian to re-
present him in that Affemblyr, and in his name
. to receive their oath of allegiance , to confirm
their privileges with the uftlal folemnities, and
to demand of them a free gift. But thne VTalen-
clan nobles, whlo considered thiis meafa~re as an
indignity their country, which was no less
entitled , than his other kingdoms , to the
honour of their favereign's presence, declared,
that by 'the fundamental lawls of the constitution
they could peither acknowledge as king a per-
son who whks absent, nor grant him any su-b-
fidy; and to this declaration they adhered with
an haughty and inflexible obffinacy. Charles-,
piqued by theiP behaviour, decided in favour of
the people, and 6athlyl authorised them to con-
tinue in arms. TCheir deputies returned in

triumph, ansd were received by their fellow-
citiizefi as the, deliverers of fheistcountry. T~Ihe
inf~olerce of the multitude incrediag with their
faccef~s, the~y es-pelled all the nobilesi out: of. the
pity , coammitted the governraent to magistrates
of their own el~etion, and entered into an
althation diftin~guifhAed by the name of Ger-
maada or Br~otherhood, which proved thes
forurce not only of the wrildeftdiforders, but of
the moit: fatal c~alampities in tha-t kingdom. h)r

Meanwhile , the ~tngdom of Ciaftile wag

known, than several oities of the first rank re-
s~olved to renionfkrate; aainft -it, ant to crave

Many concurring circumstances not only cal-
led Charles's thoughts towards the affairs of
Ger-many, but rendered his preknee in that
country neceffary.' The eledo~rs grew impa-
tient of so long an interregnum; his hereditary
dominions were difhxrbed by intestine commo-

made fuzch rapid progres~s as requ-ired the most
frerious confxderation. But above all, the mo-.
tions of -the Frenlch king drew his attention, ·and
convinced him that it was necessa8ry to take mea-
f~ures for his own defence, with 'no less speed

When Charles and Francis entered the lifts

as candidates for thb Imperial dignity, they
conduted their riralfhip with many profef0ions
of regard for eachI~thetE, anu~.w·ith repeated de-

than once to do juftiice to John d' Albert, the
exscluded monarch of Navarre, whom Francis
was bound in honouar, and prompted by in-
terest, to reffore to his throne. The French
king had pretenflons to the crown of Naples,
of which Ferdinand had deprived his predecef~-
for by a mast unjuffiifiable breach of faith. The
emperor might reclaimn the d utchy of Milan as
a fief of the empi~re, which Fralncis had seized,
and Jtill k~ept in poffellion, without having re-
:ceived inveffiture. ·Charles colnfidered the dutchy·

When the sources of difbcord wer~e so many

.a~nd. various, peace could be of no longs conti-
nuance, even betwreen princes the most exempt;
from ambition or emulation. But as -the iThock
between twco fazch mighty antagonists could not
fail of being extremely violent, they both dif-
covered no fmalln solicitude aboout its code quen-
ces, and took time not only to collec2 and to
ponder their own strength, anid to compalre it
wjyit that of thleir advtera~try, ·but to Cecure the

G o

friendship or all~iftance of the other Europearn
pow ers.

They negorciate -iNi~th the pope.

Tfhe pope had equal reason to dread the two

crivals, and saw that he who prevailed, would
become absolute master in Italy. If it had beenl
in- his power to engage them in· hostilities,
without rendering Lombardy the theatre ofwar,
nothing would have been more aglreeable to him
than to fee them ·wafte~-ach other's firength in.
endless quarrels. Bu-t this was imfpofirble. Leo·
foresaw, that, on the first rupture be~tween the
~'two ·monarchs, the armies of Franct4 and Spai~n
would take the field in the M~ilane~se; and while
the feene of their operations was t'o hear , and.
the faubje&t -f'or which they contended so interefti
in g to hind, he could not remain~ long neuteri
Hfe was obliged, therefor~e, to adapt his plan
of condu&e to his political situation. He courted
and soothed the emperor and king of France
with equal indufkry and address. Though
wtarmly solicited by each of them to espouse his,
cause , he assumed all the appearances of entire
impartiality, ;and attempted to conceal his real
fentimenlts under that profound dillmulation
which seems to have been affe~ted ·by exoft of
the Italian politicians in that age.

WKith3 the Vene~tians.

'I'he views and interest of the Venetian$

WKere got different from thofre of the pope; .nor

were they less solicitous to prevent Italy from
becoming the feat of war, and their own re-
publick from being involved in the quarrel. But
through all Leo's artifices, and notwithstanding
his high pretendious to a perfeft neutrality, it
was visible that he leaned towards the emperor,
from~ whiom he had both more to fear and more
to hope than from Fr~ancis; and it was equally
maanifeit, that if it became neceffery-g to take a
fide, the Venetians would, from motives of
the fame nature, declare for the king of France.
No considerable affIfrtance, however, was to be
expe~ted from the Italian slates, who were
jealous to an extreme degree of the Transalpine
powers, and careful to preserve the balance
between them, unless when they were fe~dutced
to violate this favourite maxim of their policy,
by the c~ertain profped of some great advantage
to th~emselves.

W~ith Henry VIIl.

But the chi~ef attention both of Charles and

of Francis, was emfployed8 in order to gain the
king of England, from whom each of them ex-
peaed afifrtance more effetnal, and afforded
with less political caution. Henry VIII. had
afcendeiF -the throne of that kingdom in the year

to exert a degree- of vigour· and authority in
his domeffick godvernment whic~h none of his
predeceffe~rs could have 'a~fely a~ssumed; bu~tper-
mitted him to take a share ini the aff~airs of the
continent, from whichi `the attention of the
English had long beer~ diverted by their un-
happy divisions. Thle immense tredfures which
his father had amassed, rendered hiin the molt:
wealthy prince in Europe. The peace which
had fabifuiited under the caultious ad~minifrration
of that monarch, was of fuxfficient le-ngth to
recruit the nation after the def'olation of the
civil w~rs·, but: not to long as to enervate its
[pirit; and the Eng~lish, as~hamed of having
rendered their own co'untry to long a feene of
difoord and. bloodthied, were eager to display
their valour in some foreign war , and to revive
the memory of the vietories gain~ed by their
'ance ffors.

His .charader,

Henry's own temper perfeft~ly suited the

sate of his kringdom, and the difpolition ofhis
fabije~ts. Atubitious , a~tive, enter prizingand-

.An opportunity soon presented its~elf; and the
viaory at Guineg~ate, together with the fuc-
~cefful iieges of Terottenne and Tournay, though
ps lit-tle uti~lityT to Engl~an, refle~ed great
Juffre onl its mzonarch, andt confirmed the ide%
which ~foreign princes entertained of his pow~er
andi imoortance. So many concurring causes,
added to the ha~ppy lituatiin of -his own domi-

sion; and to th~e fortunate circumitance of his
being in poireiiron of Calai~s, which served n~ot

passage into the Nuetherlands, rendered the king
of England the natural guardian of the libpesties
.of Europe , and the arhiter b~etwveen ,thle,emp~e

All the impolitick steps in Henry's adminiC.

tration must not, however, be imputed to de-
fSe~s in his own chara~ter; many of them were
owing to the v~iolent -pass~ions a~nd infa~itiable amnbi-.
tion of his prime minister and favourite cardinal
Wolsey. Th-is man, from one of the lowest
ranks iznlife, had risen to an height of power ~and
dignity,: to which no Englifb Abject ever arriv-
led; and governed ~he h~aught~y, presumptuous·,
and un~tradtable ijpirit of Henry with absolute
authority. Great talents, and of very different
kinds, fitted him for the two opposite stations
of miniffer, and offavourite. His pr-ofo~und judgS-
ment, his unwearied induffry, his thorough
-acquaintance with: t~he slate of the kingdom, his
extenilve knowledge of the views and interests
·of foreign courts, qualified him for that uncon-
trouled dire~ti-on of a~ffairs wi~th w~hich he was
intrufted. The elegance of hris. manners, the
gaiety of his converfiation, his insinuating ad-

dlref~s, his love of magnificence, and his 'pro-
ficiency in those parts of literature of which Hen-
ry was fond, gained him the affe~tion and con-
-fidence ·of the young monarch. Wolsey was
far from employing this vast: and almost royal
power, to promote either the true intereit of
the nation, or the real grandeur of his master.
Rapacious at ~the famne time, and profuse, he
was ins~atiable in desiring wealth. O~f bound-
-les~s ambition, he aspired after -new honours with
an eagernes~s unabcated by his former success;
:and being rendered presumptuous by his un-
common elevation , as well as by the as~cendant
which he had gained over a prince, who fecar-
c~ely brookred advice from any other person, he
dif'covere~d in his whole demaeanour the mofCt over~-
bearing hanghtinef~is and pride. To there pdi-
fions he himni'elf sa8crificed every consideration;
·and whoever endeavoured to obtain his favour,
or that of his maifter, found it nece~f~fry~ to sooth
and~to gratify them.

The court paid toWolfey byr Francis·,

As all the Aates of Europe fought Henry's

friendship at that time, all courted his minister
with incredibtle attention and obfequioafner~s,
and fkrove by pref'ents, by promiles, or by flat-
tery, to work uponl his avarice, his ambition,

vres. His chief solicitude at present was to
prevent the intended interv·iew with Francis,
the affeacs of which upon twvo young princes,
whose hearts were no less fuficeptible of friend-
thlip than their manners we~re capable of in-
fpEiring it , he extremely dreaded. But after
many delays , occasioned by difiTculties about
the ceremnonial, and by the anxious precautions
of both courts for thle safety of their refpedive
forereigns;, the time and place of meeting were
at last fixed. Aleff~engers had been s~ent to dif-
ferenlt courts, inviting· all comers , who were
gentlemen, to enter the lifts at tilt and tour-
.nament , ag~ainst the two monarchs and their
knights. Both Francis and Henry loved the
SElendour of these f e~acles too well, and were
to~o much delight~ed with the graceful ~figure
wh-ich they made on fach occafxons, to forego
tehe pleafuxre or glory wthich they expeRed from
such a singular and brilliant assembly. Nor was
the catrdinal ~1efls fond of dif'playing his magni-
ficen-ce in the presence of twJo courts, and of
d~iscovering to the two nations th~e -extent of his
influence over bo~th their monarchs. -Charles,
fi~nding it impoffthle to prev~ent: the interview,
endeavoured to dif'appoint its eff-eC~s , and to
preoccupy thle favour of the Eng~ilTh monarch,
and his mlinifter, by an aEt. of comnplaifance f~lil
more flattering and more uncommon.

Having failed from Corunna, as has already

been related , he fke~ered his course ditedtlyr
towards England, and relying wholly on Hen-
ry's -generosity for his own safety, landed at
Dover. (May: 26th. x52o.) This unexpetedl visit
furprifhd the nation. WITolfey, however, was
-well acquainted with the emperor's intentio~n.
A negoelaztioni, unkn~iown. to the hdikorians of
that ag~e, had beenl carried on betw-een himi and
the court of Spain; this viiit had b'een concert~-

he calls his· moss dear friend, an-ardditional pen-·

wa~s then at Canterbury, in his way to- France,
immediately dispatched ~Wolsey to Dover , in

~pleCafed- with an event so fbothing to -his vanity,
hastened to receive , with fauitable refp~ea, a
guefit who had placed in him fach unbounded
confidence.

All thle grand~eur, wealth , and power which
the cardinal poi~effed, did not fagtisfy his am-
bitious -mind, while there was one fiep higher
to which an ecclefaiftickr could ascend. The
~papal dignity had for foote time been the obje&
of his withes, and Francis, -as the mnoft effe~tual
method of s~ecuring his friendship, had promaifed
to favour his pretenflons , on the ~first vacancy,
with all his interest. But as the emperor's in-
fluenc~e in the colleg~e of cardinals was greatly
superior to the French king's, Wiolfey grasped
eagerly at the offer which that ,areful prince
had made him of exerting it vigorously in his
behalf ;- and allured b~y this prof~peft, whirch,
uinder the pontificate of Leo, skill in the prime
of his life, was a very diftanlt one, he entered
with warmth into all1 the emperor's fechemnes.
NJo treaty , however , was concluded at that
time between the two mnonarchs; but Henry in
return for the honour which Charles had done
him, promised to visit him in some place of the
Low Countries, immediately after taking leave
of the French king.

Interview between Henry and Francis,

Hf~is interview with that prince was in an open

plain between Guifnes and Ardres, ( June 7th.
r520.) where the two kings and their attendants
dis~played their magnificence with faxch emula-
tion, and profuse expence, as ·procured it: the
name of the field of the Cloth of Gold. Feats

Henry's ideas of his own~ importance.

-This as~siduity wvith which the two greatest~

monarchs in Europe paid court to N~eury', ap-
peared to him a plain acknowledgment that he
held the balance in his hands , and conavinced
him of the jufinef~s of the motto which he had
chosen , ,, That whoever he fatvoured would
prevail. " In- th-is opinion he was confirmed
by an offer which Charles made, of submitting·
any difference that might arise betw-teen hinx
and Francis to his sole arbitration. Northing
·could have th-e appeazrance o~f greater candour
and moderation, than the choice of a judg·e who
was reckoned the comnmon friend of both. But
as the empeior had now--- attached Wiolfey enti--
rel~y to his interest, no propo~id could be more
insidious, nor, as appeared by the, seQuel,. more
fatal to thne French king. f)

a conitant and formiduble rival to the emper~or,
aircended the Ottom~ian throne. It was the pe-
culiar glory of that period to produce the most:
illuffrious~ mon~archs, who have at any -one time

wherein they happened to flourish, conspicuous.

Diet called t-o meet at W~orms.

The first aBt of the Emperor's adminiftra-

tion~ was to appoint a diet of the empire to be
held at W~orms 'on the fiixth of JanuLary, one
thoufanmd five hun~dred and twsenty - one. In
hiis circular letters to the differenti princes, he
informed them, ~that he had called this afterns
bly in order to concert writ~h them the moiot pro-
pe~r measures for cecke:!ing the progress of those
new and dangerous opinions, which th~reaten-
ed- to difourb the peace of Germany, and to
overturn the rehigion of their anceilors.

Rlife of the iRefo~rmation:t

Charles had in view the opinions wihich

p~les since the year one thortfacad fiv:e haudred

confldered with minute attention.

that the fame hand wrrhich planted the Chriftiaen
religion, prote~ted the· reformed faith, and
xeared it, from b~eginnings exutremnely feeble, to
an amnazing degree of Atrength and. maturity.

From inconsiderable begifnnings.

It was from caukes, s~eemingly ·fortuitorts ,

and from a source very inc on-fiderable, that all
the mighty effeais of the Reformation flowed.
Leo X. when railed to the papal throne, found
the revenues of the church exhauffed by the
vast projeAs of his two ambitious predecefrors,
A-lexander. ~VI. and Julius II. His own temper ,
naturally liberal and enterprizing , rendered
him incapable of that severe and patient reco-
nomy which the fituatiott of his finances requir-
ed. On the contrary, his ifthernes for aggran-;
dising the family of IVedici, his love of fplen-
dour, his taste for pleasure, and his magnifi-
cence in rewarding men of genius, involved
him daily in new expences; in order to provide
a fund for which, he tried every device, that
the fertile invention of priests had fallen upon,
to drain the credulous multitude.

A sale of indulgences publith~ed by Leo X;.

Among others, he had recourreto a sale of In-

du~l gences Accordrlingr to thie d o ~rin e of theRomifh
church, all the good works of the Saints" ove~r
and above those which were necessa:ry ·to wTar ds
their own justification, are depoited , toge-
ther with the infinite merits of Jesus Christ,
in one inexhauffible treafary. The keys of this
were committed to St. Peter, and to his faccef`-
fors the popes, who may open it at pleasure,
and by transferring a portion of this fuperabun-

dant merit to any~particular person, for a fumt
of money , may convey to him eijt~her the pari
don of his own fins, or a release for iafly ,one
in whom he is, interelled, from the pains ofE
purgatory. Such indulgences were first invent-
ed· in the eleventh century by Urba~it II. a~s a
recompence for th~ose· who· went -in person upon
the meritorious enterprize of conquer~ing the
H~oly Land. They were afterwards granted to

Firkt appearance of Luther; and his charatiter.

Such was the favourable junature , and to dif-

posed were the minds of his countrymen to listen to
his discourses, when Martin Luther first began to
call in question the efficacy oflndulgences, and to
declaim against the vicious lives and false doc~ri-
nes of the persons empl·oyed in promulgating
them. He was a native of Eifleben in Saxony,
and though~ born of poor parents, had received
a learned education, during the progress of
which he gave many indications of uncommon
vigour and. acudenefs of genius. As his mind
was22aturally -fufeeptible of serious im~preflhons,
and tinaured with somew~hat of that religrious
melancholy which delights in the solitude and
devotion of a mnonaffick life, he retired into a
convent of Augufkinlan friars, and without As-
fering the intrea~ties of his parents to divert
him from what he tought his duty to God, he
affamed the habit· of: that order. Ther~e he ac-
quired grreat reputation, not only for piety,
but ~for his love of knowtledge, and unwearied,
app~lication to fb~udy. He had been taught the
fecholaftic philosophy and theology which were
then in vogue by very masters, and wanted*
not penetration to comprehend all the niceties

and~ diftink~fions with wthich the~y abound; ·but
his underfr audia g, naturally _foun~d, and. fupe-
rior ~to every thinzg frivolous, Soo~n became difT-
guff~ed with the ~fabtile and uninfiutai~ve fcien-
ces, and fought for faome more solid foundattion
of knowled~ge and of piety in the holy fecriptu-
res, Having foundi a copy of the Bible , whic~h
lay legl~e~fed in the library of his monaftcery,
he :abandoned all other purfaits, and devoted
himself to the fludy of it wvi~th irch eagerner~s
and aiduity, as afforii-fhed the monks, wvho
wcere little accuffomedl to derive their theolo-.
grical notions fora that source. The great pro-
grref~s which he Inade In this uncommon codrfe
of ffady, aug~mented to, much the fame both
of his fanchity and of his learning, that Frede-
rick , eledcto of Saxony , having .founded ~an
uzniv'erfity at Wittemberg on the Elbe, the
place of :his residence, Luther was chos~en sirs
to teach _philosophy, and afterwards theology
there; and dik~harg~ed both o~ffxces in f~ueh a
m~anner, that he was deemrued the chief or~na4
axent of that society.

He o- poses the f'ate of Indulgences.

'While Luthe~r was at the height: of his r-e-

putation andX authority , T~etzel bega~n to puablifh
Indulgences in the neighbourhood of Wirttemberg,
and to adfcribe to them the fame imaginary vir-
'tues, whi~ch had, in other places, imposed on
the credu~lity of the people. As Saxony waS

not: mor~e enlightened than th~e ·other provinces
of Germany, Tetzel .met with: prodigious fucceik
·there. I~rt was with the utmoRk concern, that
LTuther beheld th1e artifices of th~ose~ whio ifod,
and the simp~licity of those w~ho bought Indul-
grences. The opinions of Thomas Aquinas and
the orth~er fchoolmen, on wh-ich the do~-rine of
Inrdulgences was founded, had already loflt uchn
of their authority with him; and the Scriptures,
wcrhich he began to confider as the great standard
of theological; truth, afforded no countenance to
a prac'ice, equally subversive of faith and~ of
-mo~rals. H~is warm and impetuous temper did
not· su~er him long to conceal s~uch im~portant:
discoveries, or to conctinue a silent [~peRatorr of
the deluflon of his countrymen. From the pul-
pit in the great church at Wittemberg, he in-
veighed bitterly against the. irregularities and
vaices of the monkrs who publiihed Indulgrences;
he ven~tured to examine the do~trines whi~ch th~ey
taught, and pointed out to the people the danger
·oftelying for fatlvation upon any other means
than those appointed by God in his word. Thle
Iboldnef's and novelty of these opinions drew great
attention , and being recommended by the
authority of Lunther's perso~nal charadter, andi
delivered with a popular and perf~ualve elo-
quenzce, they made a deep imnpreffion on his
h~earers. Encoulraged by the favourable reception
of his do~rines aLmong the people, he wrote to
Alibert, eled~or of Mients and. archbifhiop of MTag-

deburgh, to whose ~'jurifdiaithn that part of Sa-
xodny was~ fu2bje~t, and remonfirated warmly
agailfit the falf'e opinions, as well as wickred lives,
of the preachers of In~dulgences; but he: found
that prelat~e too deeply interefled in their faxccefrs
to corrre~t their zlabues. H3is ne~xt· attempt was
to gain the fuzffrkiige of men of fearinmig.

·He publishes hi~s theses againlt them.

For this purpore he publifhd ninetyifive

thdkes; containing his Tentiment~s with regard
to Inrdulgences. Thef'e he proposed, not as
points fully eftabdlifhed, or of undoubted cer-
tainty, but as fubje~ts of inquiry and dis~putation ;
he appointed a day, on which the learnedwere
invited to impugw thiem, either idperfbon, orby
writing·; to the whole- he fabjoi~ned folemnn pro-
t~efttions of his high refped fbc the apefdtoick
fee, and of his implicit fubm-ifflon to its autho-
rity. -No opponent appeared at the time prefixed;
the theses spread over Germany with aftonithing
rapidity; they were read ivith the greatest eageir-
ner~s; and all admired the boldnlefs of the man:,
who had ventur~ed nort only to call in ques-tion
the plenitude of papal power, but to attack the
Domninicans, armed wilth all the terrors of in-r
quifitorial authority. 1)

Supported by his own order.

The friars of St. Auguffine,. Luther's own

order, though addi~ted with no lerts obfequiod~C
ness than ·the other monaftick fratern~ities to the
papal fee, gave no check to the publication of
t~here uncomnmon opinions. Luther had , b~yhis
piety and learning, acquired ex~traordinary autho-
rity among his b~rethren ; he profef~fed the highest
regard for the authorit~y of the pope: his pro-
fegions were at that timne sincere; and as a secret
enmity;, excited by interest or emulation, s~ub-
fiifts amnongC all the monaftic~k orders in the Ro-
raith church, the Auguftinians were highly pleafi-
ed with his invehives againit the D~ominicans,
and hoped to fee them exposed to the hatred
and s~corn of the people. Nor was his sovereign,
the ele~or of Saxony, the wisest prince at that
time in Germany, diffatisfxed with this obftru~tion
which Luther· threw in the way~ of the publica-
tion of Indulgences. He iecretly encouraged the
attempt, and flattered hims~elf that: this dis~pute
among the Ecclefiafticks' themselves, might give
some check to the exaf~tions of the court of' Rome,
which the secular princes had long, though
without faccefCs, been endeavoluring to oppose.

M~any endeavour to confurte hire.

Mlany zealous champions immediately arose

to defend opinions on which the wealth and
power of the church were founded, against~
Luther's attacks. In o~ppoiltion to thereB theies,

STetzel published count-er-theres at Francfort on
the Oder; Eccius, .a celgbrated Divine of AuJgf-
burg, endeavouired to refute his notions; and
Prier~ias, a Domini-can friar, maiter of the fh-
cred palace and Inquifitor-eneral, wroteaganint
hi~in w~ith allth~e virulence of~ a fIcholaffickr dif-
patiunt(. · But thie manner· in which they con-
duk~ed tite controverty, did little service to their
cauifie. Luther attempted to combat Indulgen-
ces by argumenta founded. in reason, or derived
from furipture;5 they produced no~thing inl sup- -
port of them but the sentiments of fchoolmen,
the conclusions of the canon law , and the de-
crees of popes. m) The decision of judges to
partial and interefled, did not satisfy the people,
wJho began to call in queffion the authority
even of the'e- venerabl~e guid-es, when they
found them~ Randing in direR opposition to th~e

Airres, intent ~up~on great fchethes ;of policy, a.
fkranger to theological controversies,· and apt to
dek'if~e th~em, regabrded with -the utmost indiffer-
ence the operations of an obfbcute friar, who,
in the heart of Germany, carried on a fcholaf-

Leo to take mea~u~res for the s~ecurity- of the
church _against an attack that now appeared too
fCerious to be derpifed.

He is fammoned t~o appear at Rome. July a5Ig.S

For this end, he summoned Luther to ap-

pear at Rome, within sixty day~s, before the
.auditor of the chamber, and the fame Prierias
wvho had written against him, whom ·he empow-
eted to examine his do~trines, and to decide
concerning them. He wrote, at the Ame time,
to the eledor of Saxony, bes~eeching him not-
to protent a man whos~e heretical and prophane
tenets were to thocking· to pious ears; and en-
joined the provincial of the Auguffinians ~to
c eck, by his authority, the ras~hness of an
anrrogant monk, which brought disgrace upon
the order of St. Auguitine, and gave offence
~and difforbance to the whole church·.

The Pope empowers his' leg~ate to try him in GCermany.

From the strain of thes~e letters, as well as

from the nomination of a judge to prejudiced,
and partial as Prierias, Luther easily fkw what
s~entence he might expeft at Rome. He dis~co-
vered, for that reafobn the utmost f'olicitude to
have his cause tried in Germany , and before, a
lets fufpe~ted tribunal. The profeffors in the
university of Wittemberg, anxious for the f~a-
fety of a men who did to much honour to their'

Aociety, wrote to the pope, and aflter emp~loy'
ing severa~l pretex~ts to enat~ie Lu~ther fi~om ap-
pearing at Rome , intr~eated Lezo to commit thre
examination of his do~eines to fomrre pe~rsons
of learning and auth~ority in Germany. The
ele~or requeited th~e fkme thing of the pope's
legate at, the diet of ,Augsburg; and as Luther
hmimflf', who-, -at -that -time, wvas so far ~fi·rom
having any -intention to· disclaim the papal au-
thority , that he did not even entertain the
Emallef~t furpicion concerning its divine original,
had wvritt~en to Leo a most fa~bmi~iv~e letter, pro-
mnifinRg art unreserved compliance wvith his wi.ll,
the -pope gratlified them so far as to emtpower hi3s
leg-ate in Germrany, cardinal Ca~jet~a, a Dom~i-
nican, eminent for ~fcholaftick learning, and pas~-
fionately devoted to the Roman fe~e, to hear
and dete-rmine the caLufe.

Luthler appears before the legate.r

Luther, though he had good reason to de-

cline a judge chlofen among his avowed adver-
faries, dit not hesitate about: ap~pearing~ before
Cajetan; and having obtained t:e; emperor's fa-
fe-~cond~u~t, immediately repaired to. Atugf~brrg.
The cardinal receivedi him wtith decent~ refpec2,
and endeaivoured at first to gain hIm~z~ u~pon by5
gentle treatment: But th~inking it beneathi -the
dignity of his fta'tion to enter into any fotrma:l
diIfpute w~ith a perfocn' o.f fich inferior rankr, he
req~uired him ·, by virtue of' the apoftou-ck

powers with which he was clothed, to retradt
the errors which he had uttered with regard to
Indulgences, and ,he nature of faith;i andt to
abstain, for the future, from the publication of
new and dangerous opinions. Luther·, fully
persuaded of the truth of his own tenets, and
confirmed in the belief of them by the appro-
bation which they had ntiet with among persons
conf~picaous both for learning and piety, was

Ignorance or malice of his antagoniffs had loardd

cardinal assumed, exthrtguithed at once all ho-

;to certain un~iversities which he named, and pro-
Inlifed neither to write nor to preach donceriting
Indulgences for the future, provided his adver-
faries were likewise enjoined to be silent with
refpe&t to them. p) All these offers Cajetan
dif'regarded or rejedl~ed , and still insisted per-
emptorily on -a fimtple reesntaltion, threatening
hiim with ecclefiaffical. centhlres, and forbidding
him to appear again in-his presence, runless he
resolved inflantly to comnply' with whfat he had
require~d. This haughty and violent manner of
proceeding, as .wel~l as other circumst~ances ,
gave Luther's freinids fkeh6l firong reasons to su~s-
pe&t, that even the Imperial fCafe-condu& would·
not be able to proted him from the legate's

him to withdraw secretly from ;Augsburg, and
to retur'n to his ownv country.

He is (uppor~ted by the Eledor of Saxony.

Cajetan, enraged at Luther's abrupt retreat,

and at the publication of his appeal , ~wrote to
the ele~tor of Saxony, complaining of both;
and requiring him, as he regarded the peace otf
t~he church, or -the authority of its head, either
to fend that seditious monk a p~ritomer to Rome,
or to banis~h him out: of his territories. It wras
not from .theological confidaerationhs that Frede-
rick had hitherto co~untenanced Luther ; he seems
to have been muCh a fAranger to con~-troversies
of that kind, and to have been little intereited
in them. His prote~tion flowed almost entirely,
as hath been already obfeved, from political
motives, and was afforded with great secrecy
and caution, He had neither heard any of Lu-
.ther's diitcourfes, nor read any of his booksi
and though all Germany refounded with his
fame, he had never once admi~tted him into his
pretence. r) But upon this demand which the
cardinal made, it became neceirkry to throw off
fomewrhat of his former re~serve. He had been
at great expence, and had beffowed much at-
tention on founding a new university, an obje&
of coniiderable importance to every German
prince; and fbrefeeing how fatal a blow the
removal of Luther would be to its reputation, s)

Luther's perilous situation.

Lu-t~her's situation, meanwhil~e, was such as

-w-ould h-ave filled ainy other person with the mos~t
-disquieting apprehenflonis. ~He could not expeft:
that a prince to pr~udent and cautious as Frede-
rick, would , on his accoun~t, set at: defr-aneo
the thunders of the church, and brave the pa-
pal power, which had cruf'hed some of the most
powerful of the German emperors. He knewv
what veneration wvas paid, at that time, to ec-
clefiaffical: decisions; what terrors ecclesiastical
centu~res carried along wtith them, and how ea-
slily there might intimidate and thake a prince,
.who wias rather hi~s prote-t~or from policy, than
his disciple fromt convic~tion. If he thould be
obliged to quit Saxony, hie had no profped of
atny other asylum, and rnuft stand expefed to
whatever punis~hment the rage or bigotry of his
enemies could ·in-flia. Though s~ensible- of his
danger, he discovered no symptoms of timidjtit
or remiff~ners, cut continued to- vin~dicate his:
owvn condua and opi~nions , and to inveigh
a-gainst those of his adversaries with more ve~he-
mence than ever. v)

Ai newv bull irn fsavur of indulgentces~.

It foun appearedJ that Luther had not form-

ed rath conjeaures concerning the intentions
of the Romith church. A ball, of a date prior
tghis appeal:, was issued by the pope, in which
hemagnifies the virtue and efficacy of Indul-
gences, in terms as extravagant as any of his
predecessors had vent~ured to of~e in the darkeit
ages; and without applying fish palliatives, or
mentioning faxch conlceffions, as the junndure
seemed to call for, he required all.Chriftians to
assent to what he delivered as the do~trine of
the Catholick church, and faubjeaed those who
thould hold or teach any contrary opinion, to
the heaviest ecclefiait~ical centuxres.

Forty-one propolitions, extraded out of Luther's
works, are therein condemned as heretical,

Ecandalous, and offenfive to pious ears; all
pers~ons are forbidden to read his writings, upon
pain of excommunication; foch as had any of
them in their ediody, are commanded to com-
mit them to the flames; he himself, if he did
not , within sixty days,. publickrly recant his
errors, and bu~rn his books, is prono~unced an
obstinate heretick; is excommunicated,; and de-
]ivered unto Satan for the d~effrnalon of his

his person, that he might bie punished as his

The publication of this bull in Germany ex-

cited various paffr-ons in different places. Lu.
ther's adversaries exulted, as if his party~ and
·opinions had been cruthed at once by such a
decisive blow. HEis followers, whole reverence
for the papal authority daily diminis~hed , read
Leo's anathernas with more indignation than
terror. In fbme cities, the people violently
obffru~tked the promulgation of the bull; in
others, the persons who attemnpted to publish
.it were insulted , iand the bull itself torn in
pieces, and trodden under foot. c)

Refle~ions upon the conduat of the court of .Rome i

During the course of. thefi tranfadfions,

the court of Rome, though under the diretion
of one of its ablest pon-tiffs, neither formed its'
ftchernles wvith that profound s~agacity, nor exe-
cuted them with that teady perseverance, which
had long rendered it the most perfe&a model of
political wisdom to the reft of Europe. When
Luther began to 'd~eclaim? against -Idulgencesi
two different fixeth~ods of tr~ea-ting him lay before
the pope; by adopting one of ·which the at-
tempt, it is probable, might have been crathed,
and by the other it might have been rendered
innocent. If? Luther's first departure from the
dio~rines of the c-hurch had inftantlyr drawn,
upon him the wveight of its ced~ures, .the dread
of thejre might have reitrained the ele~tor of
Saxony from protei~ing him, might have de-
terred the people from listen~ing to his ditcour-
fes, or even might hav~e overawed Luther him-
self; and his nause, likce that of many good

rnen b~efore his timne, would now have been
known· to the ,world only for his honeR but
ill-timed effort to co~rredt the corruptions of the
Rornith church. O~n the other hand, if the
pope h~ad early t~etified some difpleafazre with
thre vices and excesses of the friars who had
been employed in publithing Indulgences; if~
he had forbidden the mentioning of controvert-
ed points in difcourfbes addressed to the people ;
if he had enjoined the dif~putaits on both si~des
to be silent; if he hard been careful not to rifque
the credit of the church "by defining articles
which had hitherto been left un~determined,
LJuthe3r would, probably, have itept thort art his
ACrit dis~coveries: He wuoul-d not have been for-
ceti, in felf-defence, to venture upon new
ground, and the whole controversy might pof-
sibly have died away infed~ibly; or being con-
fined entirely to the fechools , might have been
carried on with ·as little detriment to the peace
and unity of the Romrith church~, as that which
the Francifeans maintain with the ]Dominicans,
concerning· the immaculate conception, or that
between the Jansenists and Jesuits concerning
the operations of grace. But Leo, by fluduat-
ing between there opposite fyriems, and . by'
emnbracing them alternately, defeated the effe~s
of both. By an improper exrertion of authority,
Luther was .exas~perated , but not re~trained.
By a mistaken exercis~e of lenity,· time was gi-
ven for his opinions to spread, but no progres~s

mad~ce toward··s. reconciling him to the church;

t9hirch he aft~esrwrds effe~ed; and3 would hrave
trembled w~ith horror at ·thIe thoujgh;ts of what:
at last he glorled in accomplishing. The know-
ledge of truth was nott poured into his mind all
aIt once, by any fpecjal revelation; he acquired
it by induliry and meditation, and his progress,
of conseq~uence, wa~s graidual. The doc~rines
of popery are to clofblly conneiedi, tha~t the
exposing o~f orne ·Frror conduftecd hrim naturally

onan~"

thazt artificial fabrick wmere i'b linked together,
th~at the pulling down of one loosen ed the founl
;dation ·of the reft, and rendere~d it more eaff
;to overturn them. In confuting the extrava-
gant tene~ts -concernting Indulgences, he was
o~bliged to inqu~ire tinzto the true cause of our
judiificaztion and acceptance with ·God. The
knaowledge of that difoovered to him by degrees
th~e inutility of pilgrimages and pena~nces; the
vanity of se~lying on the intercefiron of faints;
the impiety of worthipping the~rn the a~butes
·of auricular confeffroa ; and -the imaginary exif~-
tence ·of purgaitory. The deteation o f o many
~errors,- led him ·of courfie to confiider the cha-
rafter of th~e clergy who taught them; and th~eir
~exorbitant wvealth, ~the fCevere injun~tion of ce-
libac~y, togethe~r with the intolerable ig~our of
anonalitik vows, appeared to him the great four-
ces of their corruption~r. F~romn thence, it wans
but one flep ·to call in queltion the divin~e ori-
ginal of the papal power, which authorized and
~faxpp~orted sauch an tyfem of errors. As the
unavo~ida~ble result of the wrhole, he dif~claimted
the infallibility of the pope, th~e decillons of
£Echoolmen, or any other human authority, and
appealed to the wNord of God as the only Aan-
:dard of theological truth. To this gradual pro-
gref~s Luther owed his faLccefs. His hearers
wvere not thocked at firtt by any propolition too
repugnant to their ancient pre~judices, or too
remote from eftablithed opinions. Theyr were

keep pace with his dificoveries. To the fame·
cause was owing the inazttentiton, andl even in-
·diference~s witlh ·'which Leo viewr~ed Luther's
firftR ·proceedingbs. ;A dtire~3t or violent: attack

An inquiry into the caulfes which .ton~tributed ·to the b progress of

the: Reformationt.

Bfut whatever advantlages Lutrher's caufre de-

rrived ei~ther fsrom the aflftakes of his adv~erfa-
ries, or firornl his ·own ·good c-ondud~i, the 'fadi
den progrefis arnd firm eftablif~hmient of his doc-
trinres, mufElnot- be aferibed. to thefh alone. The
ABme corrup~ti~ons in the church of R~ome which-
he condemned, hd been attackied long befo~re
his appearance. The fame opinions which· he
now propagated, had been pubifhed in different
placest and were fupportedt by the fa~me ~argu-

anents. Waldus in the twelfth century, Wick-
liss in the fourteenth, and Ridfs in the fifteenth,
had inveighed against the errors of popery with
great boldnes~s, and confixted them with more
ingenuity and leatrning than could' have been ex-
peaed in those illiterate ages in which theyr
flourithed.· But all there premature attempts
towards a reformation proved abortive. ·Such1
feeble lights, incapable of~ dispelling· the dark-
nes~s wh~ich then covered the church, were soon
extinguis~hed; and though the dearines- of there
pious men produced fo~e- eff~e~ts , andE left
some traces in the countries where they taught,
~they were neither extensive nor considerable.
~Many powerful causes contributed to facilitate
Luther's prog~ress, wJhich ei~ther did. not exist,
or did not operate with full force in thpir days;
and at that critical and mature junnture when
he appeared, circumffances of every kind con-
curred in rendering each flep that he took farc-
cefsful.

The long fchifn in the fourteenth· century.

The long and feandalous fichifin which di-

voided the church, during the~ latter par~t of the
fourtedh~th centuries, had a great effedt in di-
minit-hing the veneration with which the wrorld.
had been accuffomned to view the papal dignity.
Two or three c~ontendingpontiffs roaming about
Europe at a time; fawning on the princes

whom they wanted to gain;~ squeezing th~e
countries which acknowledged their authority;
excotmmunicarting their rivals, and cursing those
wvho adhered to them, diiferedited their preten-
lions to infallibility', and exposed both their per-
sons and their office to contempt. The laity, to
who pall parties appealed, canie to learn that
fTome right of private jud~gment 'belonged to them,
and acquired the exercise of it so far as to chuf~e,
among there infallible guides, whomi they would
please to follow. The! proctidings of the cour-
cils of Constance and BarIl, spread this difref-
peAt for the Ronith fee still wider, and by
their bold exertion of authorit~ty in depoling and
eleting -popes, taught the world that there
was in the church a jurifdiaion fhperior even
to the papal power, which they had long be-
lieved to be Apreme.

The pontificates of Alexander VTI. and: of Julius U.I

The wound given on that occafxon to the

papal authority was fearcely healed up when
the pontificates of Alexander VL. and Juliys II1.
both able prince9: but detestab~le ecclefriafick~s,
railed new feadal in Chriffe-ndom. The pro-
fligate morals of the former in private life; the
fraud, the injustice a~nd cruelty of his~ puablic~b
adminiffration, place him on a level with those
tyrants, whose deeds are the greatest reproach
to humnan nature. T~he latter, though a fira-n-
ger to the odious paffonos which prompted his

predeceffocr to commit to many unnatural cri-
mes , was unlder the dominion of a reftleifs and
unwgovernable amibi~tion, which fe~ared all con-
fideiations of gratitude, of decency, or of jus3
tice, when thiey obffrud~ed the execution of
liris schemes. It was hardly possible, to be
fCirmly perfuixded, that the inhfalible knowledge-
odf a religion, whose chief precepts are purity
ansd humility, was deposited~ in the breasts of
the impious Alexander, or the overbearing Ju-
lius. The opinion of those who exalted the
authority of a council above that of the pope,
s~pread wonderfully under their pont~ificates: And
as th~e emperor and French kings, who were
alter-nately engaged in hostilities with thTofe ac-
tive pontiffs, permit~ted and even encourag~ed
th~eir fabjets to expose their vices with all thie
violence'of invel~tive, and all the petulaence of
ridicule, mnen's ears being accuftomned to there,
wxer~e not thoked wiJrth the bold or ludic~rouse
discourses of Lu~ther and his followrers concern.e
ing the papal dignity.

The immoral lives of the clergy.

Nor wvere fa~ch excesses confined to the head

of the chzurch alone. Mtany ofE the .dignified
clergy, secular as well as regular, being the
younger sons of noble farmilies, who had affum-
ed th e ecclefaiaficazl charad~er for no other
reason but that they found in the church flations
of great dignity and affluence, wiere accust~omed

totally to neg'ieft th-e duties o3f ·t-her o·Ffice, and
in~dulg~ed thenatelves without reserve in all th:e
vices to. which great wealth and. idleness natp-·
rally give birth. Though the inferior clergy
were prevented by their poverty from imitating
the expedfiv~e .luxury of their superiors, yet
gros~s ignorance and low debauchery rendered
themn as contemptible as· the, o~th~er were odi-
ous. f) The severe an~d uptnatural law o~fceli--
bacy, to w-hich both were equally fabje~t, occa-
.iioned fuich irregunlarities, -that in Tekveral Parts
of ·Europe the. concub~inage of priefis was not
only permitted, ~but enjoined.~ The employing
.of a remedy fb contrary to the genius of the

the crimnes it was int~ended to prevent were'

condition with more envy, they cedfured th~eir
crimes with grea~ter severity. NothbnSg, there-
fore , counld be more acceptable to Luther's
hearers; ·than the· violence wvith w~hidth he ex-
claimed. againff the immoralities of chlurchinen,
and every person in his audience could, from
his, owrn observation, confirm 'th~e. fruth of his
in~ve~tvi\es.

The facility w\ith inhlich these itmmoralities were pardonled.

The fecandal of therkecrimes was greatly in-

creased by the facility with which fa~ch as com-
mitted thern obtained pardon. In all the Euzro-
pean kingdoms, the impotence of the civil ma-
giitrate, imnder-for~ms of government extremeltr
irregular and turbulent, made; it necelfjary to
relax the rigour of jaftice, and uipon paym·t~ent
of a certain fine or composition ~preferibed by
law, judges were accuffomed to remit fatrther
punish~ment, even o~f the -most atrocious crimes.
Thle court of Rome, always attentive to the
means- of augmenting its revenues , imitated
this prac~tice , and, by a prepoff-erous accom-
modation of it to religious concerns, granted
its· pardons to thxch tranfgrefibrs as gave a fum
of money in order to pulrchafe them. As the
idea of compo~ition for crimes was then fami-.
liar, this firange tr~afiick was far fr~om thockrin g
mankind, that it fbon becam~e general; and in order
to prevent any im~position in carrying it on, the
Offxcers of the RComnan chancery publiifhed a

'coook, containing~ the precise fam to be euxated
for the pardon of every particular fin. A dea-
con, gulilty of murder, was abso~lved for tw'enty
crowns. A bifbop or abbot might af'ainate: for
three h~undred livres. Any ecclefiaftickr might
violate hlis vows of chastity, even wvithi the most

part-iculxarly in Germany;

The burden , however, of ecclesiastical op-

preffron had fallen with such peculiar weight on
the Germans, as rendered them, though~ natu-
rally exempt fi-ro lenity, and tenacious of their
ancient cuaoms, more inclinable than any
people in Europe to likcen to those who called
on them to a~ssert their liberty. During. the-
long contests between the popes and emperors
concerning the right: of in~vestiture, and the wNars
Swhich thes~e occasioned, most of the confider-
able German ecclefiafticks joine~d the papal sac-
tion; and while en~gaged in rebelhion agamftc the
head of the empire, th~ey seized th~e Imperial
revenues, and usurped the Imperial jurifdic'tion
within .th~eir own diocefes. Upon the re-
eft~ablifhtnent of tranquil~lity , they still1 retained
there ufurpati~ons, as if by the length of an
unjust poireffton they had acquired* a legal right

to them. The emperors , too feeble to wrest
them out of their hands, were obliged to grant
the clergy fiefs, of those vast territories, and
they enjoyed all the immunities as well a
honours which 'belonged to feudatl barons. B
means 'of these , many b-iihops 'and abbots in
Germany were not only ecclefiafticks, but prin-
ces, and their charafter and manners partook
more of the licence too frequent- among the
latter, than of the faindity which became the
former, I)

where the clergy usurped a great part of the property.
The unse~ttled state of governtment in Ger-

many, and the frequent wars to which that
country wa's exposed, contributed in another
manner towards aggracndizingr ecceleiafficks. The
only property,~ during those times of anarchy,
which enjoyed security from the oppreiron of
.the great, or the ravages of war, was that:
which beloaged to the church. This was owing,
not only to the great reverence for the faicred
cha~ra~ter prevalent in those ages, but to a fu-
perftitious dtread of the sentence of excommnuni-
cation, which the clergy were ready to pro-
nounce againit all who invaded their poffefflons.
MG~any ohferving ~this , made a funrrender of their
l~ands to ecclefiafficks, and cons~enting to hold
them in fee of the church , obtained as its

device they were una~ble to procure. By 'fuch
San increase of the number of their vg~fiks , the
.power- of ;ecclefiafticks receivied a~ real and per-
`manent a~ugmentation; and as lands, held in
fee by -the lim~ited tenures common in thlofe

in the decrees of popes and councsils, but was
confirmed in - the most ample form by many of

obtaining fiich a. sentence, too often secured
abiblate impt·anity to offenders. M~any af~iun--

than that it might screen -them from the pu-

The penalty by wvhich thle sp~iritual courts

enforced their sentence~s, added great weight
and terror to their jurifdiiitionl. The censure
of excommunication was instituted originally for
prefervingr the purity of the church; that obfti-
nate off'enders, whose impious tenets or pro-
fane lives were a repi-oach to Christianity,
might be cut off from the fbciety of the faith-
ful : This, ecclefriafickrs did not fertiple to con-
vert into an engine for promoting their .own
power, and inflifted it oi the most frivolous
occaflons. Whoever defpir~ed~ any ·of their de-
cifions, even concerning civil matters, imme-
dia~tely incurred this dreadful centfure, which
not only excluded them from all the privileges
of a Christian, bot deprived them of their
righkts as men and citizens; q) and the dread of
this rendered even the most: fierce and turbu-

feirions were not fabjeat to the burdens imapol'~-
ed on thle lands of the laity. The German cler-
gy were' exemptethy law from all taxes; s) and
if, on any extraordiinary emergence, ecclefiaf~-

Thle expedients for restraining this power of the popes

in e ~e Qtual.

But the court of R~ome· easily Tound expe-

dients for eluding an agreement which put fach
ret1rain~trs on its power. The pra~tic-e of refety-v
ing certain benefices in every country to the
pope's immediate nomination, which had been
long known, a~nd often complained of , was
extended far beyond its ancient bounds. All
the benefices pofelkl3bd by cardinals, or any of
the numerous o~fficers in the Roman court; those
held. by perf~ions· who happened to die at Rome,
or vit~hin fTort~y miles of that city on their
journey to ofe from it;: those which became va-
cant by tiranflation, with niany others, were
includ~ed in the number of reserved benefices;
Julius II. and Leo, firetchingr the matter to the
utrnoft, often collated to benefices where the
right of reservation had not been declared, on
pretence of having mentally reserved this pri-
vilege to themselves. The right of ref'ervation,
howev~er, even with this extension, had cer-
tainl limits, as it could be exercis~ed only where
t~fhe benefice was a~tuaally vacant; and there-
fore, in order to render the exertion oqf papal

Men prepared to embrace Luth~er's opinions , and to

tolerate. his d~efefts.

To men thus prepared; for Chaking off the

yoke , Luther addressed himself with certaint~y
·of s~ucces~s. =As they had long felt its wu~eight ,
and had born it with impatience,. they listened
with joy · to the firlt proposal foi* procuring de-
liverance. Hence proceeded the fond anid eager
reception that his do8:rines met with, and the
r~apidity with which they spread over all the
provinces of Germany. Even, tlhe~ impe--
taofity and fierceness of Lutherts firit , his
conhfdence in -afl'ert~ing his owin opinions, and
the arrogance as well as contempt wvhere-

ch-aradter of that reforaier, dit not: a~ppear exi-

ceffive to his contemnporaries,·whofe minds were
firongly agitated by those interesting controver..
fies ~which he carried on, and who had th m-
selves endured the rigour of papal tyranny, and
seen the corruptions in the church against w~hich
he exclaimed.

SNor were they offended at that gros~s fear-

rility with which his polemical writings are fil..
led, or at the low buffonneryy which he s~ome-
times introduces into his graveit difecourfes. No
dispute was managed in those rude times.with-
out a large portion of the former ; and the
latter was common, evfen on the moss solemn
occasions, and in treating the~moff s~acred s~ub-
jets. So far were either of thes~e from doing
hUrt to his cause , that inveffive and ridicule
had some effe&t, as well as more laudable ar-
guments, in exposing· the errors .of popery ,
and in determining mankind to abandon them.

The effe& of the invtentiopn of printing on the progress of

the Re~formation,

Besides all these causes of Lpxther's rapid

progErefks, ariiing from the nature of his enter-
prize, and the junaure at which he undertook
it, he reaped a~dvaritage from some foreign and
adven~titiours circumffances , the bene~ficial in-
fluence of which none of his forerunners in the,
fame cou fe had enjoyed. Among there may
be reckoned the invrention of the art of printing,

aout hal a century before his time. By thbg

fortunate difcov'ery, the facility of acquiring~
an~d of propagalting ·knowledge was wo~nderfully·
increased ,; and Lut~her's .books , which must-
othlerwife have made t~heir way Elowly and with "

the' ca~uf'e of learning and of the Rerfo~rmation
came to be con-sidered as clofiet'y connefied , and ,
in every country, had the famne friends and the
fa~me enemies. Th~is enabled the reformerts to.
carry an the contest at first with great: fuperio-

emperor; and partly by a prudent precaution
employed by the eledtor of Saxony, Luther's
faithful patron. As Luther, on his return from
Worms, was paffling near Altenflein in Thu-
rin~gia, a number of horsemen in masks ruthed

castle no't far difiant.` There the ele~or o~rdered
him to be Aupplied uwith everyS thing necefirary
or agreeable, but the- place .of hjs; iretreat was
carefully concealed , until the .fury of the pre-
fi~ent~fl~orm -agai.nf him beg~an to a~bate, upon a
change in the political fltuation of Europe. In
this solitude, whkee he remained nine months,
and which he freq~uently called: his Patmos, as-
tear the name' of that iiland ,to which the apof11e
John- was banished, he exerted his dfual vigour
and induffry in defence of· his doc~rine-s, or in
confutation of his adversaries, triblit~hing several
treatises, which revived the spirit of his followers,c
astonished to as great degree, and ditheartened
at the sudden clifappearance .f their leader.

Progress of his opi~nions.

During his con~nement, his opinions con-

tinued to. gain ground, acquiring the ascendant
in almost every city in Saxony. . At this time,
the Auguffinians of Wittemberg , with the ap-
probation of the university, and the connivance
of the eledtor, ventured upon the· first flep to-
wards an alteration in the efkabliithe~d f~orms of
publick worthip, by abo0lish7ing the celebraition
of private maires, ~and by giving the cup! as -eill

as the bread to the laity in administering the fCa-'
zrament: of the Lord's s~upper.

Decree of. the univierfity of Paris condemulng them, and Henry

VIll. writes againSt them.

WXhatever confolatiorn, the courage and faLC-

cars of his diifciples, or the progress of his doc-
trines in his own country, afforded Luther in
his ret~reat , he there received informuation of
two events which considerably damped his joy,
as they seemed to lay inf~upera'ble obstacles in
the w~ay of propagating his. principles, in 'the
two most powerful ki~ngdoms of Europe. One
was, a solemn decree, condemnning his opinions,
published by thle university of Paris, the most
ancient, and at that time the most refpeaable
of the learned societies in Europe. The other
was, the answ;er written to his book concern-
ing the Babylonith captivity hy Henry· VIII. of
England. That young monar-ch, having been
educated under thle eye of a f~urpicious father ,
who , in order to prevent his attending to ba-
finei's, kept him occupied in the ftudyv of litera-
ture, still retained a greater love of learning,
and ftcroriger habits of apuplication to it, than are
commod among ·princes osso aative a difpolition,
and fach violent pafflons. Being ambitious of
acquiring glory of every kind, as wxell as zea-
loufly attached to the Romith church, and highly
exasp~erated~ against Luther, who had treated

Thomas .Aquinas, his favo-urite author, with
great contempt, Henry did not think it enoug'h
to exert his royal authority in oppoling the opi-
nions of the reformer , but resolve~d likewise to;
combat them with fcholarltick weapon~s. `With
this view' he published his treatise on the Seven
Sacraments , which , timugh forgotten at pre-
fetit, as books of c-ontroverty,always are, when
the occaiion thiat prodliced t~hem is past, ' is- not
deftituzte of polemical ingenuity and acuteness,
and was repre~sented by the flattery of his cour-·
ti~ers to be a wo-rk ors fach wronderful fCcienlce and
leairninrg, as exalted him no less above other
aiudthors- in merit, than he was distinguished
among them by his rank. The pope, to whom
It was pref'errted with the greatest formality in
fall conflftery, spoke of it in such terms, as if
it had been dita~ted by immediate insPiration;
aind as a. tefthnony of the gratitude of the church
for his' extraordinary seat, conferred on him the
Stitle of: Defender of the Faith, an appellation
which Henry soon forfeited in the opinion of
tlhofe from wlhomn he Jderived it, and which is
fi~Ul retained ·by his faxccefibrs, though- the avow-
ed enemies of those opinions, by coontending
soir which he merit~ed that honourable dif-

Luther's reply to b~oth.

Luther , who was not: overaw~-ed either by

t~h~e authority -of the Univeriity , or the' dignity

of the M~onarch, soon publifhbed his animadver-
fions on both in a style no less vehemnent and
severe , than he would. have used- in confating
- his meanest antagonist. This indecent boldnes~s;,
instead -of shocking· his contemporaries , was
cpnfidered by them as a new proof of his un-
da~unted spirit. A controverty managed by difpu-
t;Fnts to, illuffrious, drew more general atten-
tion; and fach was the contagion of the spirit
of inno~vation, diffufed through Europe in that
age , and to powerful the evidence which ac-
companied the do~trines of the reformers on
their firff publication , that , in ipite both as
the civil and ecclefiaffical powers combined
atgainft them, they daily gained converts both
in France and in England.

State of affairs betw~Teen Charles and Francis.

How desirous soever the emperor might be

to put a stop to Luther's progrers, he was often
obliged, during thEe diet ~a WVEorms, to turn his
thoughts to matters still more interesting, and
which demanded more immediate attention. A
war was ready to break out between him and
Francis in Navarre, in~the Low Countries, and
in Italy ; and it required either great address to
avert the danger, or timely and wife precau-
tions to resist it. Every circumstance, at that
junn~ure, inclined Charles to prefer the former
meafare. Spain was torn with intefineil com-
motions. In Italy, he had, not hithlerto secured

the aff~itknce ors aly -on~e ·ally. 'In the L~ow
Couzntries, h liis fatbjeats trembled at th e th~ouhts
oif o~a rupturle w~rith Frtance , -the fattal; effeats of
whi~ick edY th~ei~r commerce· they had often ex-~

-as fromn ·the Ifoicitude of Chievres', during his.
who~e- ad-mimift·r~ati-on, to inahltitain peace betw~eeir
the ·twto m-onarchs , proceeded the emperor's
ba~ckw;;sardnef~s to commrence hostilities. B~ut
Frarn~cis ~and~ his miniff ers . d'dd not -breath the
f~ame pa~cific spirit, He· eas~ily ~forefiaw thart coni

it;-. an~d *he poffieffed several advanta~ges wrhichl

rival, · and of overpowering him before he couild

and attached to their s~overeign b ' everyT tie of~

of wvhich the people were in arms agains~t his
ministers, and in all his prerogative wtas more
limhied than that of his rival,

IHenry VIII. favours the. emperor.

The only princes, in whofb power it was

to~ have kept doawn, oQr to have extingulfhed

this flame -on its first appe~arance, either ifzeg-
le~ted to exert themselves , or wIere ac~tive in2
kindling and spreading it. Henry VIII. though
h·e affefted to: affaume the name of mediator, an d
b~othi parties made ~frequent appeals to him, had
laid aside the impartiality w~hich faited that:
charaRer. Wolsey, by his artifices, had eftrang-
ed him fio enrtirely from the French king, thnat
he secretly fomented the discord wxhich he ought
to have compos~ed, and waited only fo~r some
decent pretext to join his arms to the empe-
ror's. n)

Leo belrtittes between the rivals.

Leo's endeavours to excite discord between

the emoreror and Francis wrere more avowred,
and had greater influence. NTot only his duty,
as the common father of Christendom, but his
interest as an Italian potentate, called upon the
p-ope to acL as th-e gutardian of the publickl tran-
quillity, and to avoid anyI meafaure that mighte
overturn ~the fyfiem, wrhichi after m~uch blood-
shed, and many negociations, was now erra-
blifhed in Italy. Accordingly Leo , who in-
ftant~ly discerned the propriety of this condnaf,
had formed a fechemne, upon Charles's promotion
to the Imperial dignity , of rendering himself
the umpire between the rivals , by fboothing

close con~federac~·y.writh either;; and a pontiff less
ambitious and enterprizing, might 4a~ve saver)
Europe from- many calamities by- adhering to!
t~his? plan. ' Rqtitthis lyigh - fp'~irited pr~elate, who
was itill in the prime of life, longed paf~iona-
to to difitiquwith h~l is pontificate by some fplen-
did a,&ion. He was impatient to wash away
the in famy o~f ha~ving loft Parma, and Placentia,
th:e a cquifition of ~which refleced to much lufkre
on the ·adminiffration of his predecessor Julius.
He beheld, with theP indi nation natural to Ita-
lians in that age , the dominion which the
Trans~alpine , or as they , in imitation of the
Roman arrogance, denominated them, the bar-
b~arous -nations-, .had attained in Italy. He flat-
tered himself, that after afif~ting the otie mo*
narch to firip the· othier' of his pofrl'efilons in tha~t
c~oun~ty , hTe might: find means of driving out:
·the 'viator in .his turn, and acquire the glory
of relloring Italy tothe fiberty and happiness
which it enjoyed fefore the invollon of Charles
VIII. when every slate was governed by its na-
tive ~princes , or its . own laws , and unac-
quatinted with a foreign yoke. Extravagant and
chimerical as this. projedt may seem, it was the
favourite obje& of alimoft every Italian eminent
;for geniuss or enterp~rjze during great part of the
sixteenth century. They vainly hoped , that
lay superior fkrill~ in .the artifices and refinements
of neg~ociation, they thould be able to bafme
the efforts· of nations, ruder indeed than them-

fielves, but much more polwerful and warlike.
So alluring was the pr~ofpe&t of this to Leo, that
notwithfianding· the gentleness of his difpolition,
and his fondnes~s for the plearures of a refined,
and luxurious ease, he hastened to difforb the
peace of Europe, and to plunge himself in a
dangerous war , with an impietuofity fecarcely-
inferior to that of the turbulent and martial Ju-
lius. o)

It was in Leo's power, however, to chufk

wrhich of the monarchs he wYould take for his
confederate against the other. Both of them
courted his friends~hip; he wavered for fCome
time between them, and at first concluded an
alliance with Francis. The objee? of this treaty
was the conquest of Nap~les, which the con-
federates agreed to divide between them. The
pope, it is probable, ~flattered himself, that
the brifkz and a~tive [~pirit of Francis, f'econded
by the fame qualities in his f~ubjeats, would
get the start of the flow and wiry councils of
the emperor , and that they might over -run
with eas~e this detached portion olf his domi-
nions, ill -provided for defence, and always
the prey of every invader. But whether the
French king, by dis~covering too openly his
s~uspicions of Leo s jfincerity, disappointed thes~e

Co~ncludes a treaty with Charles. IV~ay 8- r52r.

The chief atticles in this treaty, which

proved the foundation of Charles's grandeur i-n
Italy , were, that the pope and emperor thiouMd
joirr their forces to expel the Frenlch ouct of the
M2ailanefe , the po~2effion of whiich thou'ld lie
granted to' Francis Sforza, a son of Ludoic'o
the MVoor, wIh~o- had refide'd at Ti'ent since the
time his brothler M~aximilian had been difpoi~eK-
ed of his dominions by the French king; that
Parniks and Placentia. thould be r~eflored to the
church; that the emperor thould afiift the pope
in conquering Ferrara; .that` the annual tribute
paid by the kingdom of Ntaples to the HiolyV See
fbouldf be inclreafed; that the emperor thouldi
take the family of Medici 4tder his ·protec~ion
that he thou'ld grant' to th~e cardizkl of that name

Death of Chierres , the eruperor's favourite and mini~er,

The tranfa~ting an affairr of f~uchi moment

without his participation, appeared to Chievres
fb decifiive a proof of his having· 10ft the af~icen-
dant which he had hitherto maintained over the
mind of his pupil, that his chagrin on this ac-
count, added to the melancholy with , which
he was overwhelmed on taking a view of the

many and unavoidable calamnities attending a
.war ,ag~aift France, is said to hav~e thort~ened
fiis dys. s) But though this, perhaps, may
be opnly the conjeAure of hifforiatns,. fond of
:attributing every- thing that befalsi illufftrfous
personages to. extraordinay -causes,. and: of
ascribing even' ,their dileaifes and death to tlhe
-effe of politi~cal pat~fions, which .are :more apt
to difkarb. the enjoyment: than to -abridge the
period of life, it is certain thtth~i~s :death, at
this critical junamue., extinguit~hed, all hopes
of avoiding a ru~pture with F'rance. t) This
event, too, delivered Charles from a miniffer,
to .wh~ose ;authority The had ~beeni accuffomed
fr~om his infajncy to submit with s~uch implicit
deference, as checked and depressed his genius,
and· retain~edhim in a state of pupillage, unbe-
coming his years as well as his rank; ;bnuti this
reffraint b4eing removed, the native powi~ers of
his mind were permitted to unfold themnfelves,
and he began to d~is~pl~ay fach great talents, bjoth
in council and execution, as exceeded the he-
pes of his contemporaries, u) and command
the admiration of posterity.

attack Mlilan, hostilitie~s commeniced in another
quarter. The children of John d'Albret, kring
of Navarre, ha~ving often demanded the reftitu-
tion of the~ir hereditary dominions, in terms of
the treaty of Noyon, and Charles having as
often elud~ed their requells upon vetry frivolous
pr~etexts, Franels thought himself authorized
by that treaty to alirft the exiled family. The
junaure appeared extremely favourable for such
an enterp~rize. Charles was a~t a distance from
that part of his dominions; the troops afually
itationed there, had been called away to quell .
the commotions in Spain; the Spanish male-
contents warmly solicited him to invade Navar-
re, x) in which a considerable fa~tion was ready
to declare for the defocetrdants of their ancient
monarchs. But in order to avoid, ais much as
pofirble, giving offence to the emperor, or king
-of England, Francis dire~ed forces to be levied,
and the wair to be carried on, not in his own
name, but in that of Henry d'Albret. The
conduaR of these troops was committed to An-
drew de Foix, de 1'Efparre, a young noble-
man, whom his near alliance to the unfortu-
nate king whos~e battles be was to fight, and
what was. flill more powerful, the interest of
his sifter , madame de Chateaubriand, Francis's
favourite mistress , recommended to -that im-
portant truss , for which he had neither· talents
por experience.

Progress of thle F~rench.

BEut as there was no army: in the ~field to

oppoik him, he became master , in a- few days,
.of the wthole kIrngdom of Nuavarre, without
meeting w~rith any obitru~t~io~n b ut fro the
citadel of Pampelana . The additional worksj
tq this fortres~s, begun byt Ximenes , were still
unfinirhed;, n~or would its flight refritance have
deserved notice, if Ignatiy Loyola,., a Bikcayan
g~entleman, had not been dangerouslY wounded
in its defence. During the progre-s of .a kin-
gering- cure, Loyola happened to have no other
amusement than what he found in reading tfpe
lives of the Cfints : The effeft of this. on his
mind, naturally; enthufiaffick but ambitious and
dating, was to inspire him with such a desire
of emulating the glory of th~ere fabulous worthies
of .tk Romith church , as- led , himz into the
wildest and most extravag-antadventures, which
terminated ~at last in inflituting the society of.
Jesuits, the most political and best regulated of
all -the monaltick orders, - and from which man-
kind have derived more advantages, .and re.
ceived greater hurt, than from any other of
thes~e religious fraternities.

T~hey enter Caffile.

If, upon the reiaition of Pampeluna, L'EC-

parre had been ~satisfied with taking proper pre-
cautions for securing his conquest, the king
domn of Naavarre might still have remained an-

nx- ~·

nexed to the crojvrn of France, it reality, as
well as in title. But, pdifhed on by youthful
ardour, and encoir~aged by Franci~s, who was
too apt to be dazzled with fauccef~s, he ventur-
ed to pass the confines of NJivarre, gnd to lay
siege to Logregno, - a fmnall town in Castile.
This rouzed the Cafil~iians, who had hitherto
beheld the rapid progres~s of his arms with great
-pnconcern, -and _the .diff~entions in that kingdorni
being almost composed, both parties exerted
themselves with emulation in. defence of their
country; the one, that it ·might efface the me-
mory of .past miifcondukt by its present zeal;
the other, that it might add to the merit of
having ~fabdued the- emperor's rebellious· sub-
je~Es, that of repulsing ~his foreign enemies.

Thiey are defeated , and driven out of Navarre.

The faudden advance of their troop~s, together

with the gallant defence made by the inhabi-
tants of Logr~ogno, obliged the French general
to abandon his rash enterprize. The Spanith
armyr, which increas~ed every day, harafirng
him during his retreat, he , instea~d, of taking
t~helter under the cannon of Pampeluna, or
waiting the arrival of some troops which were
marching~ to join him, attacked the Spaniardsi
though far s~uperior to him in number, with
great knpetuofity, but with so little condudt
that his forc~es were totally routed, he himself,

In the~ heat of his ref~entinent, to fend a herald

a petty~ prince furprized Charles, and appeared
-to him ai certasin proof of his having received
pr~onxifu of powerful support from the French
king. TIhe juftnrefs of this conclusion .soon be-
tCamne evident. Robert entered Luxembourg- with·

ordelrs, and after ravaging the open country ,

moined Henry VIII. in terms of the t~reaty con-
cluded at L~ondon in the year one thousand five
hundred and eighteen, to turn his arms against
Francis as the first aggrefior. Francis pretended
that he was not ainfwerable for Robert's con-
duct, whose army fought under his own ftan-
dards, and in his own quarrel; and affxrmed,
that, contrary to an exuprefs prohibition , he
11ad seduced some sub~jects of France into his
service; but Henry paId s~o little regard to this
evafton, that the French Kingr, rather than ir-
ritate a prince whom he still hoped to gain,
commnanded D~e la Mfark to difibatnd his troops. z)

The emperor, meanwihile, was asembling

an army to chastise Robert's; insolence. Tw~enty
thousand men, under the count of Na~fa~u, In-
vaded his little territories, and in a few days
became masters of every place in them but Se-
dan. Aftler making him feel s~o s~ensibly the
weig~ht of his mafter's indignation, N~afau ad-
vanced towards the frontiers of France; and
Charles knowing that he might prefa~me so- far
on Henlry's partiality in his favour, as not be
overawed by the fame fears wihich had restrain-
ed Francis , ordered his general to besiege

Congress at: Calais, under the miediation of En-l~and,

without any' effeft.

During· there operatiois in the fLield,(Aug.I52I)

a congress was held at: Calais under the mediation
of Hienry VIII. in order to bring all di~ferences to
an amnic~able ifthue; and if tihe intentions of the
mediator had corresponded in any degree to his
profetions, it could hardly have failed of pro-
ducing fomne good effeft. Henry committed thRe
i'ole managrement of the neg~ociation , with un-
limited powers , to Wiolfey; and this choice alone
was ~u~fficient to habve rendered itL abortive. That
prelate , benzt on attaining the papal crown ,
the great obje~t: of his ambition, and ready to
faccrifice every thing in order to gain the empe-
ror's~ interest, was so little able to conceal his
partiality , that, if Francis had not been well
acquainted wisith his haugrhtyT and vindi~ctive tem-l.
per , he would have declined his mediation.

Alvieuh timne was f'pent in inquiring who had be-
g$un hboffilities, which W-~olsey a~ffeRed to re-

The conditions on which hos~tilities mighkt be

w~ith regard to there, the e~mperor's proposal~s
were fuxch, as dis~covered either that he was
utterly averse to peace, or that he knew WC~ol-
fey wtould approve of whatever terms t~hould be
o~ffered in his name. He demandied the reftitu-
'tion of the dutchy <if Burgund~y, a province,
the poffefr~on of which would have gilven him
acces~s into the heart of the kingdom; Iand re-
~quired a dit'charge of the homage due; to the

During· the continuance of the con grer~s,

WiVolfey, on pretence that the emperor himself·
would be more willing to make reasonable con-
cefions than his mini~sters, mrade an exc~urflorz
to Brug·es, to meef that monarch. He was re-
ceived by Charles, who knew his vanit~y, with
as much refp~ed and magnificence as if he had
been kring of England. But initead of advan-
cing the treaty of peace by this interview,
Wolsey, in his mafter's name ,concluded a
league with the emperor against Francis; in
which it was stipulated, that Charles t~hould
invade France on the fide of Spain, and Henry
in Picardy; each with an' army of forty thou-
'and men; - and that, in order to strengthen
their union, Charles t~hould espouse the prin-
ce~s Mlary, Henry's only child, and the aLp-
parent heir of his dominionls. e) Henry pro-
duzced no better reasons for this measure, equally
unjust and impolitickr, than the article in the
treaty· of London, by which he pretended that
he was bound to take arms against the French
kring as the fjirt agg~resso~r; and the injury whbich
he alleged Frankcis had, done him, in permitting

the duke of Albany , the head of a fa~tion in
S~cotland, which oppose~d his 'inteieft, to returri:
into that king~dom. 'He was influenced, how-
ever, by other( considerations. The advan-
tages which accrued to his fhxbjel~ts from maine
taining an exaft neutrality , or the honour that-
refuxlted to hiimfelf` from a.Eing as the arbiter:
between the contending princes, appeared to
his youthful imagination to incotididerabl~e, when
compared, with the glory which C~harles and
Francis reaped from-leading `armies or conquer-
ing provinces, that he determined to remain
no. longer in a slate of inaftivitya. Having once
ta~ken this resolution, his; inducement~s to prefer
an alliance with Charles were obvious. He
had no claim upon any part of' that ·prince's
dominions, \mast of which were fb situated,
·that h~ie. ;could not attack them witihout great
difficulty and disadvantage; wh'ereas several
`inaritime provinces of France ha~d been long in
the hands of the E~ngifth monarchs, wh~ose
Ipreteniions, even to the Crown of that king-
am , were not as yet *altogether forgotten; and
the poffeirion of C~alais not oirly. gave him eaf'y
ascefk $nto some of there provines , but in cafb
of any difiafter, afibrded him a focure retreat.
W~hile: Charles attackre~dFrance on' one fro~ntie~r,
Eienry flattered hims~elf that he would find little
resista~nce on the other, and that th~e glory of
re-annexing to the crowvn of England, the an-
dient inheritance of its monarchs on the conti-

nent,· was refekrved for his relgn. Wolsey art-
fully encouraged therie vain hopes, wJhich led
his master into facih' meaifhres as w·ere ~moss sub~-
servient to `his owpn secret fthemnes; and the
E'nglif~h, whof'e hereditary animosity again~t the
French was apt to rekindle on every occasion,
did not disapprove of the martial spirit of their
foivereign.

Hostilities in Italy.

1Weanwhile the league between the pope

and emperor' p~rod-uced great effe;5ts in Italy,
and ~rendered LIombardy the chief theatre of
w~ar. ' Thlere was·, at that t'ime, s~uc-h con-
trariety- between the ch-ara~ter of the French
and Italians, that the latter fab~mitted to the
government of the former with greater impa-
tience~, than they expressed under the domninion
of other fo~reigners. TIhe phlegm of the Ger-
mans arid gravityr of the Spaniards , suited their
jealous' temper and ceremonious manners better
than the French gaiety, too prone to g~allantry,
and. too' little attentive to decorum. LewTis XII.
however, by the equity and gentleness of his
adminiffration, and by granting the M~ilanese
more extenilve privileges than thos~e they had
enjoyed 'under ·their native princes, had over-
come, in a. great measure, their prejudices,
and reconcileda them to the French gov~ernment.
Francis, on recovering that dutchy, did not
imitate the exampyle of his pre~deceiror., Though

too ge;nerous hingfelf to oppress his people, his
boundle~ss confidencre.in his fav~ourites , and his
peg~ligence in examining into the condua of
those whom he entrafted wiith power, embold-
ened them to venture upon many~ as of op-
preion.:

Th-e Milanete dilguiEed with the French government~.

The go~vernmnent: of MI~ilan .was committ~ed

iby him to Odet de Foix, M~arechal de Lautrec,
another brother of 1Hadame de ChatealL-Briand,
aim offic~er of greatC experience and reputation,
but hiaughty, impecious, rapacious, and inca-
pable either of lifitening to advice,.or of bearing·
contradialion. His insolence and exa~ions tot-
ally alienated the affeftions of tl~e Milanefefr~om
Framce, drove manny of the confiderablle citi-
zenrs into banish~ment, and force~d others .t~o re-
tire for their own ~afety. Among the last was
Jeorome M~oronk, vice-chand-ellor of Mflilan, a,
mnan whos~e genius for intrig~ue ,and enterprize
diftinguit~hed him in an age and country, where
violent fations, as well as frequent~ re-volutions,
affordigg great s~cope for farch talents, pro~duced
or called them foitth in greait abundance. He
repaired to Francis Sforza, whose brother IVaxi-
milian he; had betr~y~ed; and futpeting the
pope'.s intention :of attacking· the lMilanefe, al-
though his treaty with! the emperor was not yet
made publick, he proposed to Leo, in name of
Sforzms, a, echeme for, surprising· feveyal places,

in that datchy by means of the exiles, who,
from hatred to the French , and from attach-
.ment to their former mnafters. w~ere ready fo~r
any deiperate enterprize. Le~o not only encou-
raged the attempt, but advanced a considerable
famit towyards the execution of it; and when,
through un~foreseen accidents , it failed of fauc-
cess· in every part, he allowed the exiles, who
had assembled in a body , to retire to Regg'io,
w~thich belonged at that time to the church.
The rtlarechal de Foix, who commanded at
Mrilan in abs~ence of his brother La-utrec, who
was then in France, tempted with the hopes
of cat~ching at once, as in a Bare, aillthe avow-
ed enem~ies of his ma~fter's government in th~at
country, vent~ured to march' into the ecclefiaf-
tical territories, and to invest Reggio. But
the vig-i~lnce and good conduft of Ghicciardini
the historian, governor of that place, obliged
the French general to abandon the enterprize
with disg~race. f)

·really beien signed s~ome months before this
time; ( June 24~. 2-521.) and he publickly ex-

W-7ar in the MR/ilanefe.

Leo ha.4 already begun preparations for war

by taking into payS a. corifderable body of Swiss ;
but the Imperial- troops advance~d to slowly from
Napt-es, and Germany, that: it was the middle of
autumn before the array ·took the field under the
~command pl Profpler Colonna, the' most: eminent
of the Italian generals , whofb exttre~me caution,
the effe~it of long experience in th~e art of war,
were opposed with great propriety to the impe-
tuofity 'of the French. In the mean' time, De
Foix dispatched courier after courier· to inform
the king of the danger w~hich was approaching.
Francis, whose· forces were either enliployed in
the Low Countries, or affeinblizig on the fron-
tiers of Spain, and who did not exped to' fud-
den an attack in that quarter, frent ambassadors
to'his allies the Sw~iss, to procure from them

the immediate levy of air additional body of
troops; and commanded Lautrec to repair forth-
with to his government. That gerieral, who
waT;s well acquainted with the great neglect of
teconomy in the adminiffration of the king's
finances, and who knew howt much the troops
i~n thek MVilanefe had already fuffered fromn the
want of their pay, refused to set out, unless
the fu~m of three hindred thoufaint crowns was
immediately put into his hands. But the king,
Louise of Savoy , his mother , Aind Semblancy~,
the fiup~erintendent of f~inances, havng promised,

he t'hould find remittances for the fu'm which he

*Lautrec, notwitithktanding this cruel difapi

pointment, found means to assemble a confii

that of the confiederattes. H~e adopted the plan
olf defence most fuitarble to hi~s fituzltion, avoid-
ing a. pitched battle· with the greaiteft carei while
he harassed the enem~y continually with his light
tr~oops, beat up thbeir quarters , intercepted their
cosvoys, ahd covered or i-elievted every place
wkhich they attempted .to attack; By this pmu-
-dent ~condud, he not only retarded thibir progress,
but wvould havie soon wearied o~ut the poipe:, who
had hitherto: defrayed almoff the whole expence
f ·the wsar , as the emperor, whole revenues in
Spain were diflpated during the commotions in
t~hat-2ountry , and who was .obliged to s~upport
a numerous army in the N~etherlands, could not
make any considerable remittances into Italy.
~But: anl unforeseen accident difrconcerted all his
measures, a~nd occasioned a fatal reverse in the
French affairs. A body of twelve thousand SwiTs
served in Lautrec's army under ~the banners of
the iepublick, with which France was in alliance.
By a law, no less political than humane, eftra-
bithed among thre cantons, their troops were
riot hired out by publick authority to both the
contending parties.in any war. This law, the
love of gain had. s~ometimes eluded, and private·
persons had been allowed to enlist in what s~er-

vice they pleased., though not under the publickr
'banners, but under those of their officers. The
Clardinal of ·Sion, wiho still pres~erved his interest:
among his countrymnen, and his enmity to France,
·havbig prevailed on them to perm~it'a levy of
this k~ind, twhelve thousand Swiss joined the army
of- the confederates. The cantons, when they
fawv so many of their countrymnen marching un-
der hoff ile fItandard , and re~ady to deffroy each
other, became fb s~ensible of the infamy to wh'ich
they would be expoifed, as well as the los~s theyt
might f~uffer , that they' dispatched couriers , com-
inanding their people to leave both ar~mies, and
to return forthwifh into their ownr~ country. The
Cardinal of Sion, however, had thieaddref~s, by~
corrupting· the messengers ap-poin~ted to carry this
order, to prevent it from being delivered to the
Swiss in the ifevice of the confederates; but~
being intimated in due form to those in the French
army, they, fatigued with the length of the
compalgn, and murmruring for want of pay ,
instantly yielded obedience, in s~pite of Lautre's
remonfrtances and intreaties,

After the desertion of a body which formed

the firength of his army, Lautrec durst no longer
face the confederates. He retired towtards 1Vni-

placed his chief hopes of safety in preventing
the enemy from passing the river; an expedient

ning of night, Pefeara arriving at the Roman
gate in the suburbs, furpriz~ed; th~e s~oldiers whom
jhe found there; those posted in the fortifications
adj-oining to it immediately fled; the marquis

city with little bloodfbed, and almoff without re-
fiftakcee the viaors being as much affonifhedl

of his tEhattered army; ~the cities of the M~ilanese,

following the fate of the capital, faurrendered
to the confederates; Parma and Placentia' were
·united to the eccles las ical state, and of all their
conquests in Lomnbardy , only the town of
Cremona , the castle of Milian, and a few in-
considerable forts remained in the hands of the

Leo r-eceived the accounts of this rapid

fuiccefiron of prosperous events with sauch tranf'-
ports of joy, as brought on (if we masy believe
the Frenlch hiffori~as) at flight fever , w~hich
being negrle~ted , occasioned his death on the
second oif December , while he was s~till of a
vigorous age , and at the height of his gor:Oy.
By this unexpe~ted accident, the spirit of the
confederacy wats broken , and its operations
fuipended. The cardinals of Sion and Mediici
left the army that they mighrt b.e pres~ent in the
conclave - the Swifa were recalled by their ~fa-
periors; f'ome other mercenaries disbanded for
want of pay ; and only the Spaniards, and a
few Germans in the emperor's s~ervice, remained
to defend the M~ilanese. But Lautrec, dteftitute
'both of men and of money , was unable to im-
prove this favourable opportunity in this mnan-

The French defeated ~in the battle of Bicoccat.

The ~id-olence or caprice of that people were

On· receiving Intelligence of this, the Swiss
·loft all patience, and officers as well as soldiers
crowding around Lanatrec, threatened with one
voice- instantly to retire, if he did not eitiher

demand with greater fi~erceness, offering them--
f~eives to form the vanguard, and to begin the
attack. L~auitrec, unable to overcome their
obstinacy, complied with their requeflt, hoping,
perhaps, that some of these unforeseen acci-
dents which fb often' determrine the fate of
battles,' might~ crown this taf~h enterprize with
iiad eferved fiibbefCs ; and convincsed that th~e es-

army. N~ext rmorniing (1Vlay I5?2.) the Swiss were
early in thre field ,and marched w~ith the great-
es~ lintrepidity· ag-inft an eniemy deeply in-
tr~enched on eviery fi3de, surrounded with artil-
lery, 'arid prepared to receive thern. As they
advanced , they f~uflained a furioius cannonade
)with -great firmnnefis, and without waiting for
their own artillery, rushed impetu~ously ripon
thle intrenchments. But: after incredible efforts
of valour, whlic~h were reconded with great
f~iirit by the French, having loft their bravest:
officers and befl: soldiers, and finding ·that they
could inake no impreflion on the enemy's workts,
they founded a retreat; leaving the field of
ba~ttle, however , like men repulsed , but not
vanquithed , in close: array, and without re-e
ceiving· any molefl~ation from the enemy.

France, after throwing garrifbus into Cremona,

furirender.

the hereditary· enemies of the Fregofx , who
under the prote~tion of France poffeffed the!

from the accefiron of fach a powerful ally; and
the prosperous situation of his affairs, at t~his
tcime, permitting him to set out for Spain, where
his presence ·was extremely nec'effry , he vi-
sited the cofirt of Engrland in his wTayt to thnat
country. He proposed by this intervi~ew not
only to strengthen the bonds of friendfbip whiich
united .him with Henry, and to excite him to
·push the war against France with vigour, but
hoped to remove any difguff or refeatmrent th-at
Wlolfey might have con~ceived on account of the
ernel disappointment wrhich he had met with in
thie late conclave. His faccefs exceeded his
most s~anguine expec?ations; and by his artful
address, during a residen~ce of fix wYeeks in En-
gland., he gained not only the king and the mi-
nifter , but the nation itself. Henry, wh~ose
vanity was sensibly flattered byr fuzch a visit, as
well as byr the studied refpe~t writ~h wh-'ich. the
emperor treated him on every· occallon, enter-
ed warmly into all his schemes. The cardinal
foreseeing, from Adrian's a.ge and infirmities,
a sudden vacancy ini the papual f~ee , dissembled
or forgot his reilent~ment; and as Charles, be-
sides augmenting thle penfloins wThich he had
already f'ettled on7 himr, Venewed h-is promif'e of
favouring hris pretenflons to the papacy, writh
all h~is iritereft, he endeavoured to merit- the
formerb and. to ~e~cure the accomp!lifhmr~entt of thte
latter byv fr-esh services. The nation~, Charing

'The Englithi invade France, but with little ithccefs.i

In order to give Charles, before he left:

England, a proof of this general ardour, Sur-
rey failed with s~uch forces as were read y, and
ravage~d the coasts o~f Normahdy. He- then made
a def~enteieieiei~~~~~~~~ on Bretagne, wh ere he plund ered and
~burnt Miorlaix·, and Come oth~er places of lefsL
confequnence. After there flight excudfious, at-
'ternded with g5reater dithonour than damage to
·France, he repaired to Calais, and to~ok the
comnmand of the principal army, consisting of
sixteen thoutidnd men; with which, having join-
ed the Flemiith troops under the~ count de Buren,
he' advanced into Picardy. The army which
Francis had assembled, was far inferior in num-
ber~ to thes~e united bodies. Bult during the long
wars between the twTo nations, the Frernch had
discovered the proper method of defending their
country against the Englifih. They had been
thaught by their misfortunes to avoid a pitched.
battle wxith the utmost care, and to endeavour,
by throwing· garrisons into every place capable
of resistance, by watching all the enemy's mo-
tions , by interctepting their convoys, attacking
their advanced p~offs , and harailing them conti-
mr ally with their numerous cavalry , to ruinz

them with the length of the war, or to beat
them by piece-meal. This plan the duke of
Vendome, the French greneral in Picardy, pur-
s~ued with no less prudence than fuccefis; and
not only prevented Surrey from takring any- town~~r
of impojrtance, but obliged him to retire with
his anny greatly reduced by fatigue, by want
-of provi~ilns, and by the loss which it had 'uf"-
tained in sev~eral unfuccefsful f~kirmithes.

Thus ended the fiecond campaign, in a war

the mnof general that hithierto had been kinldled
in Europe; and though Fratncis, by his ino-
ther s ill-timed resentment, by the dif~guffing
insolence of his general, and the caprice
of the mercenary troops which he employed,
had loft his conquests in Italy , y~et all the
powers combined against: him had not been able
to make anly impreflon on his hereditary domi-
nions; and wherever they either intended or
attempted an attack, he wras well prepare'd to
receive th~em.

Solyman's coanqeit of Rhodes.

While the Christian princes were thlus wa~ft-

ing each other's strength, Solyman the Miagni-
ficent entered HMungary~ wTith a numnerous a~rmy,
and investing Belgrade, which w~as deemed the
chief barrier of that kingdom against~ the Turkish
arms, soon forced it to surrender. Encouraged
by this success , he turned his vifforious; arms
againff the ifiland of Rhodes, the fea~t at that

time, of the knights of St. John of JeruTalem.
TIhis f'mall state? he .attacked wvith fhzch a n~ume-

acknowl~edged Rhodes to be the great bulwark

Nantry of its knights as the best security

Adrian, with a real whic~h became the hiead
and father of the chtirch, exhorted the contend-.
ing powers to forget their private quarrels, and,
-by uniting their- arms, to prevent the infidels
~from destroying a society which did honour to
the Christian name; yet fb violent and implac-
able was the animnofity of both parties,· that,
-regardless of the danger to which they exposed
all Europe, and unmoved by the intreaties of
ithe grand mast~er , or the admonitions of thle
pope., they fuffered Soly man to carry on his

operations against Rhodes with~out diftarbance.
The grand master , after incredible efforts of
·Courage, of patience, and of military condu~t;
during a siege of fix months; after fuftraining
many afl~aults, and difputingr every pos~t with

Infurre~ionl of T~oledo. MayT, I5so.

No so~oner was it: known that: the Cortes

assembled in Galicia had voted the emperor a

free gift, without r taining the redress of any
one grievance, .than it excited universal indigna-
tion. ' The citizens of Toledo, who considered
themselves, on account of the great privileges
which they enjoyed, as guardians of the liber-
ties of the Castilian commons, finding that 270
regard was paid to the remonfirances of their
deputies against that unconflitutional grant, took
arms with tumnultuaryt violence, and seizing the
gates of the cifty which were fortified, attacked
the al-cazar, or castle, which they soon obliged
the governor to farrender. Emboldened by
this s~uccess , they deprived of all authority
every person whom they fufpeEted of any at-
tachmuent to the court , establis~hed a popular
form of government, composed of deputies from
the several parithes in the city , and levied
troops in their own defence. The chief leader
of the people in these infurre~i~ons was Don
John de Padilla, the el-dest son of the commen-
dator of Castile, a yo~ung nobleman of a gene-
rous temper, of undaunted courage, and pof-
f~efed of the talents as well as of the ambition
w~hich , in times of civil discord, raise men to
power and eminence. a)

Adrian, at that time regent of Spain , had

ifearcely fixed the feat of his government at Val-
ladolid, hbenl he was thenied with an account
of there inthi-rtee~ions. 11e immediately affem-
bled the council to deliberate concerning the
proper method of suppressing them. The coun-
fellors differed in opinion; some infxffing that
it was necessary to check this audacious spirit
in its infancy by a severe execution of juftie s
o'thers advising to treat with lenity a people who
had some reason to be incens~ed, and not to
drive them beyond all the bounds of duty by
an ill-timed rigour. The sentiments of the for-
mer being warmly thpported by the archbiihop

Upon this Adrian ordered Antonio de Son-

feca, whom the emperor had appointed comn-
mkander in chief of the forces in Caffile, to as-
fembhle an army, and to besiege Segovia in
form. But the inhabitalt~s of Medina del Campo,
where cardinal Ximenes had eftablitfhed a vast
ma~gazine of military flores, would not fuffer
hiin to draw from it a train of biattering cannon,
or to destroy their countrymen wirith those arms
wh~ichi had been prepared against the enemies
of the kingdom. Fonseca, wzho could not
execute h3is orders without artilleryr, deter-
mined to seize the magazine b>y force, and the-
citizens Pcianding on their defence, he ailaulted
the town wiith great: briskness : But his troops
were fb wanrmly received, that des~pairing of·
carrying the place, he fbt (Aug. 21. I5 20.) fire to
some oft he houtes, in hopes that the citizens
wvould abando'n th~e walls, in order to save their
families and effeAs. Instead of that, the expedient
to 'which he had recourfb served only to in-
crea~se their fury , and he was repulsed with
great infamy, while the flames f~preadinig from
~street to fireet~, reduaced to afhi-es almoff the
whole town, one of the most confideratble at
that time in Spain, and the great mart for the
mianufa~tures of Segovia , and fbveral other
cities. As the warehoules were then filled with
goods for the approaching fair, the loss was
Immense, and was felt unuiverfally.~ This,-

a~dded to the finiprleffrn wvhichi f·chi C r'el ac'-
btio made on~ a people lon-g unaccuffomed to

furry than the other cities, they burnt Fonfeca's
hodle to the g~round, ele~ted new m aagif~trates,
raised soldiers, ·appointed o~fficers to command
them, and g~uard~ed their .walls ·wit~h as much
diligence as if an enemy ha~d been ready to atiS

neither the c~olitae Inor fkgacity neceff'ary at

Sfended him, as much as- he. had injured them.
This c~ondef~eniio'n, thae effe& ~of irrefblurtion
and timidity, rendered~the malecontents bolder

and mo~re -infoent; and the cardinal having ibon
a~fter recalled Fonkeca, and difmiiffed his troopa,
which he could no longer afford to pay, asths

Thie view~s and pretensions of the, cotntons of C~aftilie.

~Nor were the proceeding~s of the commons

th-e. effef~ts merely of popular and tumul~tuary
raige ; theyT aimed at obtainingr redress of their
political grievances, and an -efabilifhment of
publick liberty on a secure basis, obje~ts worthy
of all the z-eal which' thiey discovered in cons
tending for themz. The feudal govrernment in
S ain was at that time in a state more fav~our-
able to liberty than in any other of the great
European kingdoms. This was owing chiefly
to the number of greet cities in that countryi,
a circumnitance I have already takecn notice of,
and which contributes more than any;sther to
unitigate thle rigour of the feudal institutions,
and to introduce a knore liberal and equal form
of government. The inhabitquts of every city
~for~medl a great corporation, with valuable im-
munities and privileges; they w~ere~ delivered.
from a state of iitbjedtion and vaflklage 4 they-
were qdigitted to. a considerable Chare in the le-

giflatate; 'tie-y acquaired· the a~rts of induffry,
:wi~tho~ut which. ci~ties cannot fabilit; they acco-
- nufiated: wealth-, by -engaging in commerce;
and :being free ·and independent - themselves,
w~ere the guardia~ns of the publick freedomn and
i~ndependence. T~he genius of the internal go-
Veralmentl efkabif~h~ed in cit~ies,·- whic~h, even in
co~unatries w~here defpotich power pr~evails most,
is demnocrkt'iccll and republican, rendered thej
idea of liberty familiar and dea~r to them. Their
representatives in the Cortes were acecuftom~ed,
with- equal spirit, to check· the encroachments
of the king,- and th~e oppreirion of the nobles.
They endeavor>-ed to extend the privileges of
thCli own order; they laboured to thake off the
reain-inng incumbrYanices with w~hich the feudal
tyra-nny had burdened them; and, confelous of
rbeing- or e of the most confi'derable orders in the
-state, were ambitious of becoming the most:

The present junduare appeared favourable

for ·p t~hing any new claim. Their sovereign
was abf~enmt fi-orn. his dominions ; by th-e ill-con-
dlu&t o~f his mainifters he had loft the efl~eem and
affe~tion of his fa-rbj~e ts; 'the people exasperated
by ma~ny inrjuries had taken arms, though with-
out concett, - almroft by general content;- they
-were animate~d w~ith rage ~capable of carrying
Stheirt to the most ~violent extremes; the royal

t'reafury \vas exhausted; the kingdom destitute
of troops; and the government commit ted to a
flranger , of great virtu-e indeed, but of abill-

had been prompted to take arms by the fame

Ielves as \a dift~in~t body from the reft of the
f~ubje~ts;, they did not find this difficult. ~A ge,
neral convention was appointed to be held at
~Avila. Deputies appearied th~ere in name of al,
most all the cities entitled to have reprefentatig·
ves in the Cortes. They all bound themselves,
by iolemn oath, to live and die in the ser~vice of
the king, and in defence of the privileges of
their ordIer; and allumning the name of the holy
Junta or association, proceeded to deliberate
concer~ning the Rate of the nation , and the

him, -that as the had never heardi, till that

to do what is necefl'ary for the publick welfare.
Padilla, too eager in forming a conclusion agreec
able to his withes, moifook this lucid interval
of reason for a perfeat retain of that faculty;
and acquainting the Junta with what had hap-
pened, advise~d them to remove to Tordefillas,
and to holdt their meetings in that place. This
was inflantly done; but though Joanna receiv-

point now to be deliberated upon, wras, whe-

he ii'2ued circular letters to all the cities of Caf-

The spirit of liberty w~rhich it breathe~d..

Su~ch were th~e chief articles prefeated by~

the Junta to their sovereign. * As the feudal
Iintitutions in the several kingdoms of Europe
were originally the fame, thle genius of those
governments which arose from them bore a
strong -resemblance to each other, and the re-
galations which the Caftilians attempted to efta-
blifh~ on thiis socafxon , diffekr little from thofie
wrhi~ch other nations h~ave laboured to procure
in their stru~ggles with their monarchs of liber-
ty. The grievances. complained of, and the
remedies propos~ed by the English commons in
their contests with~ the princes of the house
of Stuart, particularly resemble those upon
wvhich the Junta now infrtfed. But the prin-
ciples of liberty s~eem to have been better un-·
derftood , at this period , by the- Caftilians,
than by any other people in Europe; they had
acquired more liberal ideas with refpe~t to their
own rights and privileges; they had formed
more bold and generous sentiments concerning
government; and difeovered an extent of poli-
tical knowledge to which the English themfel-.
ves did not attain until more than a century as-
terwards.

Irritates the nobles.

It is not improbable, however, that the

~spirit: of reformation among the Caftilians, hi-
therto unreffrained by authority, and embold-

patience the emperor's answer to their remon-

Violent propolitions of th~e Junta.

This excited such violent paffons as tranf-e

ported the whole party beyond all bounds of
prudence, or of moderation. That a Castilian
king· thoiuld deny faubje~ts access into his pre-
f~ence, or refuse to listen to their humnble peti-
tions, was re~prefeated as an a& of tyranny so
unprecedented and intolerable, that: nothing
now remained but w~ith arms in their hanuds to
drive away that ravenous band of foreigners
which enc~ompaffekd the throne, who, after
having devoured the wealth of the kingdom,
found it neceifary to prevent the cries of an
injured people from reaching the ears of their
forereign. Many inifided warmly on approving
a motion which had formerly been made , for
depriving Charles, duiring· the life of his mo-
ther, of the regal titles and authority which had
been too rathly conferred upon him, from a

The regents, meanwhile , appointed Ri~o-

feco as the place of rendez-vous for thetir troops,
w-hichi, though far inferior to thof'e of the com-
mtons in nrumber, excelled them greatlyT in dif-
cipline and in valou~r. They had drawn a con-
fiderabnle body of regular a~nd veteran infantry
out of N2avarre. Their· ca2valry , wThichn form~ed
the chief strength~ of their arrmy, coniift-ed mostly
ls. gentlemen accustomed to the military life ,
and animated with~ the martia-l ifpirit peculiar to

Imprudence and ill foccefs of the general of the Janta.

·Giron mnarch~ed with his army direaly to

Riof~ece , and fiezing the villages and pffs,
around it, hoped that the royalists would be

'obliged ·either to fuxrrender for want of pro-

villon, or to fight with disadvantag~e before all
their troops were assem-bled. But he had not:
the abilities, nor his ·troops the patience andi
.discipline necesSary for the -execution of such
-a s~cheme. The Cond6 de Hlaro found little dif-
·ficulty in condu~ting a conflderable reinforce-
-ment: through all his poffs into the town; and
Giron, defpairingr of being able to reduce it,
advanced thd~cdenly to Villa-panda , a place be-
longing to the constable , in which ·the enemy
had their c~hief magazine of provisions. By this
ill-judged motion, he left Tordefillas open to
theroyalifts, whom the CondB de Haro led thither
·in the night, (December 5. Erso.) with utmost
secrecy and dispatch; shid attacking the town.,
in wJhich Giron had left: no other garriifon *tbhn

9 into it after a derperate resistance, became maf-

feat:, with the other enligns of government.

Auch of the nobles a~s had hithierto been wazver,

commo~ns. T~his was much increafie~d by the
f~ufpicioni they began to entertain ~f Gfiron,

What they flood most in need of, was

money to pay their troops, A ~great part of.
the enrrent coin h~ad been ,carriied out of th~e
.kingdom by the Flemings; the ·Rated taxes le-
vied in t-imes of peace were inconsiderable; com-
merce of every kiind being interrupted by the
war , the fum· which they yielded decreated
daily; and, the Junta were afraid of difgufthng
the people by burdening them with new impo-
fitions, to which, in that age, they were little
·accustomed. Pu'tit~rom this difficulty theyT were
extricated by; Donna IMaria Pacheco, Psidilla's
Wifkj a woman of noble birth, of great- abili-
ties, alfboundlefs ambition, and animated with
the most ardent zeal in fulpp~ort of the cause of
the J u'nta'. She ,. with a, bol~dnes~s superior to
those ·:hperftitious .f:ears which often 'influence
her iAx, - propoded to seize all the rich and ma-
gtnificent orfanambuts .in the cathedral of Toledo;
but left th~t- a~tion., by· its appearance of im-
piety , might offend the .people, the and her
retinue marched .to the church in' fblemn pro-
celionr, in mourning habits, with tears in their

eyes, besting their breasts, and fal~lingr on their
knees, implored the pardon of the faints whoife
thrines the was about to violate.~ By thiis arti-
~ilce, which~ screened her from the imsputation
of sacrilege, and perfoaded the people that ne-
~effity and zeal for a good cause had confrrine~d
her, though with relud-ance, to venture upon
this a~tion, tihe procured a con~derable faplply
of money for the Junta. o) The regents, no
.1efs at. a loss how to maintain their troops, the
revenues of the crown having either been difft-
pated by the Flemings, or seized by the com-
mons, were obliged to take the queen's jewvels,
together with the plate belonging to the nobi-
lit~y, and apply them to that purpose; and when
thof'e failed, they obtained a small fam by wTay
of loan fr~om the k~ing of Portugal. p)

The nobility discovered great unwillinguefs

to proceed to extremities with the Junta. They
were animated with no less hatred than the
commons against the Flemings ; they approved
much of s~everal .articles in the remnonf~twae ;
they thought the jun~ture favourable,. not only
fbr redrefiing past grievances, but for rendering
the constitution more perfe~t and secure by newr
regulations; they were afra~id, that while the

no person had aris~en among the commons of
foch su-perior abilities or elevation of mind as
to require the dire~tion of their affairs; Padilla,
-their gen eral, was a man of popular qualities,
but diffruffed for that reason by thos~e of highest
lank who adheredl to the Junta ; the condu&
of Giron led the people to view, with fuxrpi-
·clon, every person of noble birth who joined
their party; so that the firongeft marks of irre-
-solution , mutual diffruft , and mediocrity of
genius, appeared in all their proceedings at this
time. After many confuzltaltions held concern-
ing. the terms proposed by the regents , they
fuffered themselves to be to carried awvay by
resentment against the nobility, that, reje~ting
all thoughts of secommodation, they threatened
to fkrip them of the crown lands , which they
or their ancertors had usurped , and to re-annex
these to the royal domain. Upon this prepofie-
rous s~cheme , which would at once have an-
mibilate~d all the liberties for which they had
been struggling, By rendering the kings of Caf-
tile abfolutet and independent on their fubje~t~s,
they were to intent, that they now exchaimed
Swith les~s vehemence ag-ainst the exa~tions of
the foreign miniffers, than against the immense
power and wealth of the nobles, and seemed
to hope that they might make peace with Char-
les , by offering to enrich hial with their
spoils.

Smimnbers of the -J:Lnta into this meadure, filling

'fortune, laid sie~ge to T~'orrelohaton , .a place of
giteater firength and importance than any that
he had. hitherto attacked, and which was de-
-fended by at fufficeient grar~ifon; and thoug~h the
hbefieged: made a desperate r~eflitance, and th~e
admiral asttempt~ed to relieve the~m, he took;
·(1Viarch x. x52I.) the town by storm, and gave
·it up to 'be plundered by. his soldiers. If he
had march~ed- infanatly with his vi~toriouxs armny
to Tordlefillas,: the head-quarters of the roya-
liftsi he could hardly have ~fail~ed of making ane

b~eing of fuf~ficient fkrength to' give, him battle.

Imprudence of their condna*.

But the ficklenes~s and imprudence of the

J~unta prevented his taking· this fiep. Incapable
like all popular associations, either of carrying
on war , ·or of makirng peace, they .listened
again to overtures of accommodatiojn, and. even
agreed'to a thorrt fulpkenflon of arms. This ne-

gociatioln terminated in nothing;. but while it
was carrying· on , many of Padilla's s~oldiers,
unracquainted with the restraints of dif~cipline,went
oftfwith the booty which they had got at Torre-
10barton; and others, wearied out by the unufiral
length of the campaign, delbrted. r) The conftable'
too had leisure to assemble his forces at.Burgos,
and to prepare every thing for marching; and
as fboo as the truce expired, he effe~ed a junc-
tion wi~th the Cond6 de Haro, in spite of all
Padilla's efforts to prevent it. They advanced
immediately towards Torrelobaton, and Padilla,
fmnding the number of his troops so diminif~heda
that he durift not rifkr a battle, attempted to re-
treat to Toro, which if he could have accom-
plifhled, the invaiion of N'avarre at thnat jundture
by the French , and the neceiity wchich the r-e-
gents must have been under of detaching men
to that kingdom, might: have saved him from

this bold attempt of the commons, like all un-

and extend the power of the crown, which it
was intended to moderate and. abridge. The
Cortes still continued to -make a part of the
Castilian constitution, and were i~fummoned to
meet whenever the kring fl~ood in need of moneyt;
but Iintead of adherinig to their ancient and.
cautious form of examining and redreiling pub-.
lick grievances, before they proceeded to grant
any fuzpply, the more courtly eulkom of voting
a donative in the first place was introduced,
and the sovere~ign having obtained all that he
wanted, neve l~owed them to enter into any
inquiry, or to a'ttempt any reformation injurious
to his authority. The privileges which the
cities had enjoyed were gradually circumferibed
or abolifrhed; their commerce began fr~omi this
period to decline r and becomning les~s wealthy

He was def~itute of money fulfficient to pay his

the Imperialif~s retired to Milan, preparing to'
abandon the town as so~on as t-he French thould
appear before it. By an m unccountable negli-

his g~ood fortune presented him. The citizens

were employed night and day 'in repairing the
fortifications, in amafinmg proviflons, in colle~ting
troops from every quarter; and by the time the
French approached , had put the city in a con-

his own troops more than the enemy , was obe

Cardinal Wolsey, not dithleartened by the

dlifapp~ointment: of, his aanxbiious views at the!
former ele~tion, had entertained more sanguine
hopes or faccefs on this occasion. Henry wrote
tp the emperor, reminding-xim of his engage-
me~nts to second the ~pretensions of his miniffier,
~Wolsey beftirred hims~elf with a~ivity faitable
to the importance: of the prize for which he
contended, and inftradred hlis agents at Rome
to spar~e neither: proniifeq nor br'ibes in order to;
·gain his end. But Charles had either amused
him with vain hopes which never i~ntendedi to
gratify, or he judged it impalitickr to oppose a
candidate who had sauch a profpe&t offucceeding
as Medici ;j or herhaps the cardinalls durit not
venture to provoke the people of Rome, while
their indignation against Adrian's memory was
itill fret~h, by placing another Ultra-montane
on the papal throne. Wolsey, after all hisex-
petation and endeavours, had the mortifica-
tion to fee -a pope ele~ted, of fach an age, and
of so vigorous a constitution, that he jould not
comfort himself much wi~th the chance of f~urvivr-
ing him. This s~econd proof fully convinced
Wolsey of the emperor's insincerity, and it
excited in -him all the resentment which an
haughty mind feels on being at once disa~ppoint-
ed a-nd deceived; and though Clement endea-
voured to sooth his vind~ifive nature by granting

-Henry's operations in Frane;- C

Henry· had, during the campaign, fulfilled,

with great fineerity, whatever he was bound
to perform by -the league against France, tholg~h
more flo~lrly than he could have withed. His
thoughtlel' profusion, and .total negledt ofoeco-

'nomy, reduce -himn often to gr~eat firaits for

money. The operatio~ns of war were now car-
ried on in Europe in a manner very -different
from that which ha~d long prevailed. Instead
of armies .faddenly assembled , which under

diftin~t: chieftainS .followed their prince into the
field for a ~hort; space, and s~erved at their own
cost, troops were· now levied at great ch~arge,
and received regularly considerable pay. Instead
of impatien~ce on both sides to bring every -quar-
rel to the iffuze of a .battle , which commronlyg
decided the fate of open and defenceless counl-
tries and allowed the b~arons, together with
their vassa~ls, to return to their ordinary occu-
pations, towns were fortified with. great art,
and def~ended with much obiainacy; war, from
a very simple , became a. very intricate fhcience;
and campaigns grew of cours~e to be more te-
dlious, and less decisive. The expence which
thefb' alterations in the military fyfiem necef-
fairily created ,. appeared intolerable to nations
hitherto unaccufkomted to the burden of heavy
taxes. Hence proceeded the frugal, and even
parsimonious spirit of the Engifh parliaments in
that age, which Henry , with all his· authority
was seldom able to overcome. The .commons,
having refuted at th~is time to grant: himx the
supplies which he demanded, he had recourf'e
to the ample and almost unlimited preregative
which the kings of Engrland then p~offeffied, and
by a violent and unufaal exertion of it, raised
the mo~ney he wanted. This, how~ever, wasted to
much time, that: it was late in the season (Sept.co,
r523·) before his army, under the duke of
Suffolk, could talke the field. Being joined by
a sonfiderable body of Flemings, Suffolk mnarsh-

ed iintd Picafdy, and Francts fpiaoi his . ex-

Sentimentst of the tiew pop~e.

The enfaing year opeined with events more

difaffrous to France. Bontarabia was loft (feb.
a·7. 152144) by the ~cowardice, or treachery of
its governor. In Italy, the allies resolved on
an early and vigorouis eftort in order to difpof-
fes~s Bonnivet of that: part of the Mfilanefe wvhich
lies beyond the Teflino. Clement, who, under
the pontificates of Leo and Adrian , had dif-
covered an implacable enmity to France, began
now to viewv the power whichi the emperor
was daily acquiring in Italy , with To much
jealoufyr, that he refused to accede, as his pre-
decefibrs had done, to the league againf Fran-

cis, and ftorg~etting .private palfflons, and animo·L

au~t all hiis en~de~avours ·7were ineffeakial; a

both the nienaces and intreaties of their officers,
threatened to pillage the city of 1Wilan, if they

ing a retreat into France thro~ugh the valley of
Aoft. Just as he arrived on the banks of the
SeffiTa, and b~eg~an to pass that river, Bourbon
and Perfcara appeared with,~the vanguard of t~he
allies, and attacked his rear with g~reat fury,.
.At the beginning of the charge, Bonnivet, while
exerting himfelf' with much valour, was woundr-
ed to dangerously as 'oblig~ed him to quit the
field ·; and the condu~t of the rear was com-
mitted to the chevalier Bayard, who, though
to much a firanger to the arts of a court ,that
he never rose to the chief commandl, wras always
called, in times of real danger, to the poits of
gr~eatest. difficulty: and importance.

Death~ of the chevalier Bayard, and ruin of the

French arm~y,

He- put him-self at the head of thye men at

arms, and animating them by his presence anid
example, to fufftain the whole thock of the ene-
my's troops , he gained time for the reft~ of his
counltrymen to make good their retreat. But
in this service he received a wound which he
Immediately perceived to be mortal, and being
unable to continue any longer on horseback, he
ordered one of his attendan~ts to place ]him under
a tree, with his face towards the enemy; then
fixing his eyes on the guard of his twvord ,
which he held up inficad of a cross, he addreil
fed his prayers to God , and in this poftere,
which bdeame his chara~ft~er both as a foklier

ahd as a Christian, he calmly waited the ap-
proach of death. Bourbon, who led the fore-
most of the enemy's troops, found him in this
fiturat~ion, and expressed regret and pity at the
fight. ,, Pity not me, "~ cried the high-fiPirited
chevalier, ,, I die as a man of honour ought,
,, in th~e discharge of my duty : They indeed
,,are objefts of pity , who fight against . their
,, king, ~their country, an~d their oath. " The
-marquis de Pefeara , pati~ng s~oon after , mani-
feited his admiration of Bayard's virtues , as
well as his sorrow for his fate, with the gene-
refity of a gallant enemy; and finding that he
could not be -removed with . safety from that:
spot , ordered a tent to be pitched there , and
appointed proper pers~ons to attend Ihim.a He
died, netwiith-ftanding their care, as his ancef-
tors for several generations had done , in the
Sfield of battle. Pefecara ordered his body to be

embalmed, and sent to his relations; and fiuch
was the refpeAt paid to military merit in that
age, that the dukre of Savoy commanded it to
be received with royal honours in all the cities
of his- dominions; in Dauphind, Bay~ard's rative
country, the people of all rarks came out in a.
solemn p~rocefi~on to meet it. u)

ed of less prudence and moderatiofx thath hid
mainfer, began to propagate wild and dangerous
opinions, chiefly among the lower people. En-
couraged by his exhortations, they roes in f~ieveral
villiages of Saxogly, broke into the churches with
tumultuarty violence, and threw down and de.
firoyedl the imaages with which they were adorn-
ed. Th-ese irregular and outrageous procedings
·were to repugnant to all the eled~or's cautious
mnaxims, that, if. they haxd not received a ti-
mely chek, they could hardly have failed of
alienating from the reformers a prince, no less
jealous of his own authority; than afraid of
giving offence to the emperor`, and other pa-
trpns of the ancient opinions. Luther, fenfthle
of the danger, imraediately' quiitted his retreat,

wsnithout waiting for Frederick's permiiron anld rel
turned (Mtarch 6. r522.) to Wittemberg. s3ap-
pily fo-r the reformation, the veneratirin for
his person and authority wvere still Iso great,
that his appearance alone fbpprei~ed that spirit
of extravagance which began to. Ceize his par~t.
Carloftadius and his fanatical followers, ftrukr
dumb by his r~ebukes, declared that they heard

Luther translates the Bible,

Before Luther left his r~etreat, he had

begun to translate the Bible into the German
tongue, an undertaking of no 'iefs difiiculty
than importance, of which he was extremely
-fond, and for wYhich he was well qualified : He
had a competent knowledge in the original l-an-
guage~s; a tho~rough acquaintasce with th~e style
and feutiments of the inspired. wiriters ; and
tho~ugh his compofiitions in Latin were rude and
barbarous , he was reckoned a great imiter of
the purity of his mother tongue, and could ex-
pref's himself with all the elegance of which it
is capable. By his own assiduous a pplication,
together with the al~iftance of M~e-an~thon and
several other of his dif~cipes , he finished part
of the New Teftamrent in She year I532; and
the publication of it proved mor~e fatal to the
Schurch of Rome, than that of all his own works,

Mieafures employed by Adrian in ord er to cheks the progress

of the Reformation,

The court of Rome behel~d this growing

defeaion with great concern ; and Adrian's first:
care after his arrival in Italy, had be~en to de-
liberate with the cardinals , concerning the
proper means of putting a flop to it. This pope
was profoundly skilled in fehiolaitic theology ,
and having been early taken notice of on that
account, he still retained such an excellive ad-
miration of the science to wrhich he owed his
reputation and faxccef~s in life, that he confider-
ed Luther's inve~tives against the ifchoolmen,
particularly Thomas Aquinas, as litt'lelets than
blasphemy. All the tenets of that do&or ap-
peared to him so clear agnd irrefragable, that
he fuxppofed every perfPon who called in queffion
or contradi~ted them, to be either ~blindted by
ignorance , or to be aaing in opposition to the
convi~tion of his own mind : Of cours~e, no
pope was ever more bigoted or iunlexible with
regard to points of do~rine than Adrian; he
not only maintained them as Leo had done,
because they were ancient, or because it was
dangerous for the church to allow of innova-
tions, but he adhered to them with the zeal
of a theologian, and with the tenacioudnef~s of
a disputant. At the fame time his own man-
ners being extremely fimtple, and uninfeaed
with any of the vices which reigned in the
court of Romne, he was as sensib~le of its cor-

raptions as the reformers themselves, and. view~,
ed themn with no les~s ind~igniatio~n. The brief
which he addressed to the diet of the empire
affemnbled (No~vember, f5221) at 14nremberg,~and
the inffru~tials he gave Cheregato, the nuncio
whom he kfet hith~er, wer~e framed agreeably to
Sther~e views. On the one hand, he condemned
Lu~rther's opinions wifth more asperity an~d ran-
cour of experefon than L~eo ha~d eyer used; he
severely centured the princes of Germany for
f~ufferingo him to spread his pernicious tenets, by
their negle~tingto execute the edfift of the diet
at Worms, andi required them, if Luther did
not: instantly retra.E his errors, to destroy him
with fire as a ganrgrened and4 incurable memnber,
in likre manner as Datsgn and Abirate had been
cut off by 1Moses, Ananilas and Sapphirat by
the apk~7iles, and falan Hus~s and Jerome of
Prague by their ancefters. On the other hand,
he with great candour, and in the moRt expli-
cit terms, acknowledged the corrup~tions of the
Romnan court to be~ the founrce fro~m whvich hald,
flowed mornc of the evils the church now felti or
- ireaded; he promised to exert all his authority
towards reforming there abdeks, with as much
diipatch as the nature and inveteracy of the
dikerders wrould admit; and requested of them
to give him their ~advice ,with rigard to the
most .effet9:al means of fu~ppreirng that new
herefyT which had sprung up among them. a)

D~iet of Niuremberg· propose a g~eneral council as the proper

repiedy.

The members of the diet, after pr~aiiing

the pope's pious and laudable intentions, ex-
cur~ed themselves for not executing the edid of
Worms, by alleging that the prodigious increase
of Luthef~s follow7ers, as well as the averflon
to the court of Rome among their other s~ub-
jeats on account of its innumerable exa~tions,
rendered such an attempt not onlyT dangerous,
but impoiible. They affirmoed that the grie-
vances of Germany, which did not arise from
imaginary injuries, but from impositions no less
real than intolerable, as his Holiness would
learn fr~om a c~atalogue of them which they in-
tended to lay~S before him, called now for some
new and efficacious remedy; and , in their
opinion, the only remedy adequate to the dif~-
ease, or which afforded them any hopes of
feeingr the c~hurch reffored to soundness and vi-
gotr , was a General Council. Such a council,
therefore,· they adv7ised him, after obtaining
the emperor's codient, to siremble without de-
lay, in one of the great cities of German-y, that
all who had right to be pref'entmight deliberate
with freedom , and propo~se their opinions with
such boldness, as the dangerous situation of re-
ligion at this jundure required. b)

papal authorityl and the reverence and farb-

For that reafoa he einlployed his attnoft address,
in order to prevail on the-thembers of the diet
to proceed thems~el~ves with greater severity
against the Lutheran heresy, and to relinquish
their proposal concerning a general council to
be held in Germrany. They , perceiving the
nuncio to be mobre fofircitous about the ~interests
of ghe Romzan court , than the tranquillity of
the empi~rel, or purity of the church, remasined
inflexible, and continued to prepare thbe cata-

did not think it decent to~ join with them, drew
ilp the lift (so famous in the German annals)
of an hundred grievances, which the empire
imputed to the iniquitous dominion of the papal
fee. This lift contained griev~ances much of the
fame nature with that prepared under the reign
of Maximilian. It would be tedioous to enume-
rate each of them ; they complained of the sums
exased for dif~penfations, abf'olutions, and in-
durlgences; of the ex pence arising from the law-
faits carried to Rome; of the innumerable abutes
occasioned by reservations , comnmendams, and
annates; of exemption from civil jurifdi~tion
which the clergy had obtained ; of the arts by
which they brought all secular causes under the
cognizance of the ecelefiaftical judges; of the
indecent and profligate lives which not a few
of the clergy led; and of various other parti-
culars , many of which have already been men-
tioned among the circumstances which contri-
buted to the favourable reception, or to the
q-uick pro~gress of Luther's doctrines. In the end
they concluded, that if the. holy fee did not
speedily deliver them from those intolerable
burdens, they had determined to endure them
no longer, and would employ the power and
authority with which God had entrusted them,
in order to procure relief. e)

the calling of a council, and reforming ahutfes
in the papal court, which the ~rashness and in-
capacity of his predecessor had brought upon
him. For this purpose, he made chice of car-
dinal Campeggio , an artful man , often en-
trafted by the popes with niegoc~iations of im-
portance, as his nuncio to the di~etof the empire
assembled ag~ain at Naremnberg.

Campeggio, without takilng any notice of

what had paffedl in the la A meeting, exhorted
the 'diet in a long discourse, to execute thie,
ediat of W~orms with vigour, as the only es-
featual means of f~uppre~ifitag Luther's dolftrines.
The diet, in return, defi~lred to k~now: the pope's-
intentions concerning the co·uncil, -and the redress
of the hundred grievances. The former, the
nuncio endeavoured to elude by general and
unmeaning declarations of the pope's res~olution
to. pursue filch meafares as would be for the
greatest good of the church. W~lith regard to
the latter, as the catalogrue of grievances did
nlot reach Rome till after Adrian's dea~th, and
of consequence had not been regularly laid be-
fore the present pope, Campeggio took advan-
tage of this circumstance to decline making any
defirnitive anfwver to thiem in Clement's namte
though, at the fame time, he observed that
'their catalo me of grievances contained many

p~articulars extremely 'indecent and* ufdutiful;i

~having obtained -the concurrence of the king of

defraying the expence of the expedition during:
the first month, and had it: in his choice either
to continue the payment of that fum ·monthly,
or to invade Picardy before the end of July with

a powerfu~il army. The emperor engaged to at-
tack Gaie3nne at the f~amne time with a confii-
,derable body of men; and if there enterprizes:
proved fuecef~sful, they ag~e-ed, that Bourbon,
besides- the territories which he had 10ft, t~hould
be put in poffe~flion of Provence, with the title
of king, and thould do homage to Henry as
th-e lawful king of France,. for his newt domi-
nions. Of all. the part~s of this extenilve but
e~xtrav~agant projied;, thle invas~ion of Provence
was the only one which was executed. For
although Bourbon , writh a forupulouls delicacy,
;altogethfer unexpe~ted after the part which he
had afted , politively refafed to acknowledge
3Henry's title to the crown of France , and
thereby absolved him from any obligation to
promote the enterprize, Charles's eagrerners to
carry his own plan into ex;ecution did not in
any degree abate. The army he employed for
that purpose amounted only to eig~hteen thousand
men; the supreme command of which was given
to the marquiis de Pefecars, with infird~tions to
pay the greatest deference to Bourbon's advice
in all his operations.

and entering (August I9. I524.·) Provence, laid

France in the manner wThi~ch they had proje~ted,
that kingdom must have b-een exposed to the
most imminent danger. But on this, as well
as on- many other occaiions, the emperor found
that the extent of his revenu11es was not adequa~te
to-the. greatness of his power, or the ardour
of his ambition, and the want of money obliged
him, though with much reluftape, to circum-

The Imperial troops had been obliged to

retire almost ruined by hard duty, and ditheart-
ened witha ill succes~s; the Milanlefe had been
flft altogether without defence; it was not irn-
pofAible to reach that country before Pefeara,

with his thattered forces, could arrive there;

were in no condition to makre head againfit his

appeared to his sanguine temper to b~e of the
utmost weight. In vain did his wise~st ministers
and generals reprefeat to himr the danger of
taking the field at a feaf~n to far advanced, with
an army composed chiefly of S wifs and Ger-
mans, to whos~e caprices he would be f~ubjeat

s~afety muff ab~solutely depend.

In vain did Louise of Savoy advance by hasty

fournies towards Provence, that the might exert
all her authoritry in di~izading her son from fach a

self the pain of an interview with his mother, who-
f'e counf'els he had determined to. rejeat, he began

These brisk~ motions of the French monarchs

diticoncerte~d all the ~iifghems of defence ~which
the ImnperifaLifs had formed. -Never, indeed ,
did generals attempt to oppos~e a formidab'le in-
vafion under fuxeh ·circurmffances of disa8dvantag~e.
Though Charles poffi~d dominions more exten-
fiive than any other prince in Europe, and had,
at this time, no other armny but that which was
employed in Lombardy~, which did not amount
to sixteen thousand men, his prerogative in all
his different states was to, limited, and his subs-
je~ts , without whofb consent he could rais~e no
taxes, discovered fach unwillingness to burden
themselves with new or extraordinary impofx-
teions, that even· this small b~ody of troops was
in want of pay, of ammunition, of provilions,
and of c~lothiing. In such a situation, it, required
all the wlifdom of L~annoy, the intrepidity of
Pefeara, and the implacable res~entment of Bour-
bon , to preserve them from sinki~ng urider def-
pair, and to inspire them with resolution to a~t-
tempt, or f8g~acity to discove-r, what was efien-
tial to their fCafety. To, the efforts of their ge-
nius, and the a~tivity of their zeal, the empe-
ror was, more indebted for the pres~ervation of
his Italian dominions than to his own power.

he oughit to take. 'Alrl his officers of greatest
experience were unanimous in advising him to
retire, and to decline a battle wiith a enemy
who courted it from des~pair. The leaders of
the Imperialists, they obs~erved , would either
be obliged in a few weeks to disband an army,
which they were unable to pay, and which
they kept together only by the hope of pillage,

less than by her words, with such zeal in d~e-
fence of their country, as its prefeat situation

required. She colle~ted the remains of the
army which had served in Italy, ranfomed the
prisoners, paid thle arrears, and put them in
a. condition to take the field. She levied newJ
troops, provided for the f~iecurity of the froxi-·
tiers, and rais~ed sums f~uffilcient for defraing
there extraordinary expences. Her chief care,
however, wa~s to appease the refeatment, or
to gain the friendship of- th~e king of Englad;

]Eff'e~s ofE the vi~tory at Pavia on Henry V1I~.

Though Henry , irr entering into alliances

with Charles or Francis, seldom followed any
regular or concerted plan of policy, but was
infiluenced chiefly by the caprice of temporary
pairons, such pecurences often happened as re-
called his attention towards that equal balance
of power which it was neceff'ary7 to Keep! be-
twreen the two contending potentates, the; pre-
servation of which he always boaited to be his
peculiar office. He had expeted that his union
with the emperor might afford him an -opportu-
nity of recovering some part of those territories
in ·France which had belonged to his ancertarsl,
and for the fake of Airch an acquiiition he did
not foruple to give his affiiftance towards raiiing
·Charles'to a confiderasble p~reeminene above
Francis. He hasd never dreamt, howxever, of
any event to decjiive and to fatal as the

vlt~ory at Pavia,: which se~emed, not only to
have? broken1, brit to·hav~e a=innihilated the
powner of one of the rivrals; to that the
profp~ea of th~e fiidden and entire revolution
wh~·ic~h this. would occa~lion in the political
Syftein , filled h~im with the mait difiquiet-
ing ·apprehensions. He saw all Euzrope in dan-
ger of beiug over - ru by; al unmbiti'ous prince,

P~avia, had excited an high degree. of admirat~ion,
which. never fails oQf asagmenting fyrmpath~y;

and Henry, natuirally fukceptible of generous
sentiments, was fond of appe-aring as the de-
liverer of a ja~nquifhed enemy fro-m a state of
captivity. ·The paif ons of the Englift mini~ster
seconded the inclinations ors the monarch. W~ol-
fey, who had not forgotten the difxppointment
of his hopes in two fbcceive conclaves, wvhich he
imputed chiefly to the emperor thought this a
proper opportunityr of taking revenge ; and Louise,
;courting the friendship as England with foi~ch flat-
tering fubmiflons as were no les~s agreeabole 'to
the king than to the cardinal, Henry gave her fe-
cret: assurances that he would not lend his aid
towards oppressing France, in its prefeat helpless
slate, arid obliged her to- prornife that thie would
not confeat to difimember the kingdomn even in
order to procure her fon's liberty. s)

eager to seize the pref'eat opportunity of ruining
the French monarchy, ~he sent ambafladers to
Madrid, to congratulate with Charles upon his

ally, engaged in one common cazufe, was en-
titled to partake in the fruits of it; and to re~-

that the vi(Sory at P~avia occatfioned the grea~test
alarm and terror. Thqt balance of power on
which they relied for their security,· and which
it had been the constant objea of all their -ne-

could either form dangerous pretenflons upon

with much s~olicitude concerning the means of
raising such a force as might obfiru& his pro-

century, while Charles was fal~pedted by all his
neighbours of aiming at universal ~monarchy,
and w~hile he was really formidg vast projea~s
of this kind, his revenues were to limited, thati
be could not kieep on foot his viaorious army ,
though it did not exceed twJ~renty-four thous~and

mnen.

The Em eror's deliberations concerning the manner of Im-

proving h~is viaoryr.

During these tranfaaions, Charles, whose~

pretenflons to moderation and defintereitednefs
were fCoon forgotten, deliberated with thle utmost
solicitude, how he might derive the greatest ad-
wahtatses from t~he misfortune of his adversary.
Some of his counsellors advised him to ·treat:
Francis writh the magnanimity· that became a
viaorious princej and, instead of taking advan-
tage of his ~situation to impef'e rigorous condi-
tions, to difmitsf him on s~uch equtl terms, as
would ~bind him for ever to his intereftr by thie
ties of gratitud~e and affetftion, more forcible as
well as niore permanent than any w-hich could
be formed by exterted oaths and involuntary fth~i
pulations. Such an exter~tion of generosity is no-t,
perhaps, to be expeaed~ in the conduEt of politi-
cal affairs, and it w'as far too re~fined for that prince
to whom it was propoifed. The more obpious,
but left splendid, scheme of endeavourIntg to
make' the utmost of Francis's calamity, had a
greater number in the council to recommnend it,,

and fuxited better with the emperor's genitts. Buij
though Charles adopted this plani, he did not:
execute, it ih a: proper maki~er. In £1ead of mah.~
ing oise gina~t effort to penstrate into France with
all~ thie: fordes· of Spa~n' and the Low Countries ;
thftead of cruthing~ the Italian slates before they
recovete~d from the conieernait~ion which the the~
cers of hiS arms ha~d oceaiioned, he had recourf'e
to the at'tifices of intrigue and negociation. This
proceeded~ pairtly from neceirty, partly from the
liatural disposition of hiswiind. Th'e~ fituartion of
his financesj at that time, rendered it extremnely
diffic~ult to carry oln any ex raordinary armam~ent ;
and~ he~ hitnfrelf having ilever aprpeared at the~
head of ·his armies, the: command of whiich he
had hitherto commlitted to his generals, wTias
averse to bold. and ma~rti~al counsels, and. trafted
mrore to `the arts witr -which. he was. acquainted,
j-le laid, befidesgj too much, firef~s upon the vic-
tory ·of Paviaj as ifty that event the fkrength
of France had been annihilated, its refournces
·dshadtiedi and the kingdom itself, no les~s than
the p~erlks of its stironarch , had been fbbjetted
~to his power.

:The rigoarous terins he pr~opoles to Francis.

Full of this opinion , he determined to set~

the hightft price upan Francis's freedom, and
having ordered the count de Roeux to vrifit the
captive king in hi~s name, he inftrn~ted him to
propose~ the following articles, as the condi-

tions

tions on which he would grant himn his libertyt
That he ihould restore Burgnedy to the empe-
ror, from wh~ose anceffors it had been unjuffly
w~refied; that he t'hould furrrerider Provence and
Dauphin £, that they might be ereated into. an
independent; kingdom for the constable Bourbon;
hat he thJould make full fatisfk~tion toi the· king
of England for all his claims, and finally re-
nounce the ·pretensions of France to Naples, '1Vi-
ha n, or anmy other territory in Italy. W~hen
Francis, who had hitherto flattered hinif~elfthat
he thould be treated by the emperor with the
genlerofity b~ecoming one great prince towards
another, heard therfe rigorous conditions, he
·Was so tran~fpozted writhc indignation, that, drawv-
iing his dagger hastily, he crid out: ,,STWere
better that a king t~hould die thus. * Alarcon,
a~lar-med at his vehemence , alid hold on his
hand; buit though he soon reicovered grea~ter
ceompofure, he till declared, in thesoft solemn
-manner, that he would rather remain a prif~onet
during life, than purchase liberty by sauch ig-
nominiouss conceflons. z)

This mortifying dis~covery of the emperor's

intentions,- greatly augmented Francis's chagrina
~and impatience under his confinement, and tnuit
hrave driven him to abfiolate des~pair, if he had

gocia~tions passing through the fat~bord~iniate hands

wihich ·proceeded from to favourable an opinioni
of the e~mperor's charadter, he offer~ed- to visit
him in Spain, and was wtilling to be carried
thither as a fpe~tacle to that paug~·ht:y nratio tel
Lannoy employed all his address to confirnm hin~i

which he cast many a sorrowful and desiring

A fewi days after Francis's arrival at 1VIa-

having relied without foundation on the empe-
ror's genetofity, Henry VIII. concluded a treaty
with the regent of France , which afforded him
s~ome hope of liberty from another quarter.

to himself. T~fe flight offences, added to the
weighty considerations formerly mentioned, in-

wvith so many· reservations , and fubje~ted bin

of Mlilan a dependent op the emperor, rather,

Such an acceifflon of pow-er- as would have ac-
crued fr~om the ad dition of the Mlilanefe to the
,kingdom of Npgles , w.as considered by Morone
as fatal to. the liberties of Italy, no less than to
his owtn powier an~d importan~e. Full of this
idea, he began to revolve h~i his mind- the poffi-
bility of refci~ing Italy from tb e yokie of so--
reignesrs; the darling fchelme as has been
already observed , of thke Italian politicians in
that age , and which it wras the great object of'
their ambition to accompliifh. If to the glory
of having been the chief infiru~ment of driving
the French out of Mifrlan, he could add that of
delivering N~aples from the dominion of the Spa-
niards, he thought that nothing would be want-
ing to complete his fame. His ferti~e genius

~r-eaty of TAladrid 19a6.

As thtere were the viewvs an~d sentiments of

the twro Monarch~s, the treatyr which procur~ed
Fr~ancis his liberty was ligned at 1Vadrid, on
t~he fourteenPth of Janua~ry, one thousand five
hundred and twsenty-fixi. Th-earticle wsith regard
to Burgunndyt, whichi had hithbert> icreated the
greatest dilhc~ulty, was compromised; Francis,
engag-ing to r~eftere that dutc~h with all its d-e-
pendencies in full f~overeigonty to the Empetror;
and Chiarles codeknting; that this ~restitution
thould not be miade utntil the Kii~g: was set a-t
lib~erty : in order to jfecure the performance of
this, as wtell as the other conditions in the
treaty, Francis agreedj that at that fame in-
fient he himself was releavfed, he would deiver
as hoffagres to the Emperor, his eld~est son the
Dauphin, his second fan the duke of Orleans,
or in lies of the latter, twelve of his principal
nobility, to be named by Charles. The other
articles Evwelled to a great number, and, though
hot of farch importance:, wiere extr-emely rigotr-
ous. Among there the most remnarkiable were
that Fr~ancis t~hould renounce all his preteniions
in Italy; that he thould disclaim any title Which

h~e .had· to the · ibvereig~nty of Sland~ers and As~
tois; thaitj within fix weeks a £ter his rel~eafei
hec t~hould refktei· to Bourboli atnd his atdherent~s
all threir goods , moveable aci inmmoveable;
arid makre them fuill reparation for the dathnages
which they had faff~ained ~by, the confiircation of
them.;' that he thould use his interest with
Hen-ry D,'Albret to ·relihquit~h his pretenfiobs to
thie rowcn of Navarre, and. t~hould not for the!
future afiift hini in· any attempt tb recover it-
t~hat there fbould be established~ betwieen the
Emperor ~ad Francis a, league of perpetuai
friendship 8 nd confederacy, wvith a' promire of
.mutual' aflifitance in every cafe· of ~erefity1.
That, in corrobor~ioihi of this union, Frtheis
t~hould marry the Emnperor's fiffer, the Queen
Dowa~ger of Portugal; that Francis tChould cadd~e
all the articles of this treaty to he ratified bji

ceiving this ratification, the hoffng~es t'hould be

Angouleme 4i thed King's third son, thould be
dlelivered to Charles , that in order to mnanifeft,
as well as to fltrengthen the unit~y between the
two Monarchs ,- he' might: be educated at the
Imperial court; and that if Francis did not ,
within the; time limited, fulfil the flipulations
in· the trepty, he thould. pr~orixi~fe , upon his
honour ·and. oa~th, to return into S~pain, and to

fuzrrender himself again a prisoner to the Em-
. pgror. i)

Sientiments of that age wtith respecT to it.

By this treaty, Charles flattered himself that

he had not only effe~aally humbled his rival,
but that he had taken foch precautions as wF~ould.
for ever prev-e~nt his re-attaining any formidable
degree of power. The opinion, which the.
wisest pol~iticians formed concerning it, was
very different; they could not perfhande t~em~-
selves that Francis, after obta~inng· his liberty,
wI~ould execuzte artilcles against whichi he hiad
firruggl~ed to long, tnd-to whichi even amidftthe
1orrors of captivity he had codiented with sachs
relucfance. A~mbition and resentment, they
knew, would conspire in prompting him tk
-violate the hard, conditions to wrhich he had
-been constrained t-o fabmit; nor would argu,
moents and cabiffiry be wanting to represent that
wT~hich was to mnanifefil~y advantaegeos , to be
·necessary and juff. If o~ne part of Francis's con-
duB had been known at that time, this opinion
mig~ht have been founded , not in conjedure,
but in certainty.~

Francis secretly prsteft's aganiuf the validity of it.

A few hours before he figued the treaty,

he assembled such of his counsellors as were

The Emperor's carriag·e with! Itabe~lla of Portugai.

Soon aft~er t~he Emnperor had taken leave of

Francis , and permitted him to begin his jornmey
tow~ards his ow~n dominions, he set out for S~e-

likabella, the daug-hter of Emanuel, the late
35irg of Portugal, tn~d the sifter of~ehn III. who
bad fuceeded him ill the throne of t~hat kin dem.
dfabella was a prin~ces~s of uncermmon bea5ty
and accompifhm~ents; and as the Cortes, bot
in Castile an~d A~ragon , had waTrm~ly solicited
their sovereign to marry, the choice of a wife,
so nearly· allied to the royal blood of both
kingdoms, was -extremely acceptable to his
fubDjeats. The Portugues-e, fond of this new

Ifabeltli, amounting to nine hundr~ed thousand

the full rent of their farmns to the landlod; but
if th~ey chos~e either to change the place of their

to pediants expired at their death , with~out

the landlord had a right to the best of their

Another event hajppened about the fame

time, w5hich3, as it occa~ioned a cordiderab~le
chxage in ithe 'ftate of Germany T, muzt be traced
back to its source. Whbile the frenzy of the
Cruzfades pojffeffed all Europe during the twelfth
a~nd thirteent~h cetnturies, f~everatl orders of reli-
g~ious kni'ghth~ood were founded in defence of
the Chri~ian faith against Heathens and Infdels.
Among there, the T~eutonicks order in Germany
was one of the most illustrious, the kinights of
whiich diftinguiifted themselves greatly in all the
wi} d enter prizes carried on in the Boy v a~nd.,
Being~ driven at last from their fettlemnents in
the east~, they were obliged: to r~etunm to their
native country. Their zealT and valour were
too impetuous to remain long inactive. They
invaded, on veryi flight pretences, the province
of Prussia,. th~e irnhabitants of which wrere still
ido~lters; and1 havng~r colmpleted the~ I··clnquef of~
It about the middle of the thirteenthI century ,
hield it many years as a fief depending on the
crowfn of Poland. Fierce contests note during
this period , be~tween the -grand maner~s of the
order, and the Kings of Poland; thne former
f~trugingr for inldependenle, while the latter
a~fierted their righ~tt of fevereignty w~ith great

firmners. Albert, a Prinee of: the house pft
B3randen~burgh, who was ele~ted grand matter
in the year :o~ne th~ous~and1 five hllunr-ed andl e~le;ven
pgaging; keenly in this quarrel, maintained a
rlo'ng war witly Sigismund, king of Poland ; butt
pavin becomte an early convert to Lutheris doc-
trines, this gradually· lessened his zeal fbfr the
interests of his frate'riny, fb that he took tthe
opp~ortunity of the comfuftions in the Empire,
aud the absence of the Emperor, to conclude a
treaty` with Sigifmaund , reatly to his private
emolument. By' it, that part o~f Pruffra, which
.Belon kd to tihe Teutonick order, was ere~ted
snto a s~ecular and hereditary ditchy, and the
invefiture of it granted to Albert, ·jrho, in re-
t·iurni bounid hithfelf to do homage %or it to the
Kiings of Pol~ard, as their vassal. Immediately
~fte@· thiis, he made publick profeffion of the
refokmeda religion, and ~married a Princefsi ·of
Dierimar.; 'The Teutonick krnig-hts exclazimed to
loudly agalint the treachery of'thei~r grand mif-
-ter, that` he was put und~er the ban of the Em-
Yie; but: he still kept p~offefiion of the provin~ce
wvhich he j3act uitrped , and trandmittd it to

were fixed upond, him, that, boy observin~g his

cerning his fa~bfequePnt coanduA. Th~ey were not

of intendcing to executee an unreasonable treat~y,
he was 'eager' to seize the firit opportunity of

him to feign an approbation of it.- Even the

Pr~ogreis of th~e Reforrmatin.

The di-ren ons between th~e Pope an d E~m-

peror proved ex tremely favourable to ·the pro-
grfs of Lutheranifm.' Charles, exaifp~erated b
Clement's c~onduch~, and fully employed in op-
poEfing the league whichb he had f'orm~ed~ agains-~t
t~hemn, had little inclinatio~n, and Jess leif-r~e,
to take say meafares for f~upprag the newr
opinions i-n Gesrmany. In a diet of the EmpIire
held at Spires, (3I31e 25. Ty6S.) te s~tate of re-
ligion cam~e to be con~sidered, and ithat th7e Emra-
peror required of the princes was, th~at theg
wfould~ wtait patie~ntly, and wF~ithoUt encouraging
inno~vatiols , for the meeting of a general coun-
cil wrhich he had demanded of the Pope. They·,
~in return: acknowl~edged th~e c-onvocation of a
council to be ·the proper and! reguliar fiep to-
wa-~rds refo~rming abulfes inp the church; but con-
tended;, that a nstionda councl beld in Ger-
many w·ould be mo-re ef~~e~~e~~e~~e~~e~~,ruaf l fr that p-urpose
than wh~at he had proposed. To hI-s a.dviice,
concerninlg thie dif~couratgemert of in~novations;,
theyr paid to lit~tle regard, that even dulring the
meeting of the diet at Spires, the divines who
attend ed the Elemror of SaxonyT and Lan agave
o~f He-s Ee -Ca~ssel thither, pr~eached publf~ickly ,
and admini-stered the f'acremnents azcojrding to

'This manifeffo, little inferior in virulence to
the invehti~ves of Luther himifelf., ;was dis~persed
over Germanyr with .great induffry, and being
eagerly read by persons of every rank , did
mnuch more than counterbalance the eff~c2 ocF
