every work of charity which they per-
form, how unknown soever to the world,
attradis his notice. The Text pref~eats a
signal instance of thi's comfortabjle truth.
In the city of Caefagrea, there dwelt a
Roman centur~ion, a military officer ofL
inferiour rank, a Gentile, neither by
birth nor religion entitled to the privi-
leges of the Jewish nation. But he was a
devout and a benevolent man; who, ac-
cording to his meathre of religious know-
ledge, fitxdied to performn his: duty, prayed
to God alweays, anzd gae muzch alms to the
people. Such a charafter passed not un-
observed by God. So hig~hly was it he-
noured·, that to this good centurion an
Angel, was s~ent froam Heaven, in order to
dire61 him to the means of full~ infiru~c-
tion in the ~truth. The Angel. accoffs him
with this faglutation,, Cor~neius, Thy prayers
and thine alms are come urp for a gmzorizll
bePfo~R God.-

·i~It

It: is t~o the conjund~ion of prayer~s lad SER 19£

;almsJ, that I purpose now to direA your 1-
thoughts, as defecribing the refpedtable
and amiable charadter sos a man, as form-
i~ng ~the honour and the blessednes~s of a
true Christian ; piety joined with charity,
faith with good works, devotion with mo-
rality. Ther~e'are things which God hath
conne~ed, and which it is impious in
man to s~eparate. It is only when they
remain united, that they can ~come up as·
a grateful memnorial b~efore ~God. I. shall first:
endeavourr to show you, That alms with-
out: prayers, or prayers without: alms,
morality without devotion, or devotion
without morality, are extremely defec-
tive ; and then shall point out the happy
efFeats of their m~utual union.

LET us begin with considering the cafe

of alms without prayers ; that is, of good
wforks without piety, or a proper fEenf~e
of God and Religion. Examuples of this
are not uncommon~ in the world. W ~ith
many, Virtue is, or at least is pretended

A 2 to

at itM. to be, a refpeaable and an honouredl

\I~u name, while Piety founds meanly in their
- ears. They are men of the world, and-

they claim to be men of honour. They
reft upon their: humanity, their publicki
sp~irit, their probity, andi their truth.
They arrogate to themselves all the manly
and the adi~ve virtues. But devout affec-
tions, and religious duties, they treat with
contempt, as founded on fhadowyr ipecu-
Jatioqs, and fit to .exuploy the attention.
only of weak and f~uperflitious minds.
Now,, in opposition to s~uch persons, I
contend, That this negled of piety ar-
gues depravity of heart ; and that it: in-
fers an irregular discharge of the duties
of morality.

FIR T

s*, It argues internal depravity ;

for it difoovers a cold and a hard heart.
If there be any imnprefion which man is
form-ed by nature to receive, it-i~s a sense
of religion, As soon .as his mind opens
to obs~ervation and refle~tion, he d~is~cerns
inaumlerable marks of his depend~ent slate,

H~e finds himself ·placed, by some fipie- s-t Rivr;~i
riour power, in a vast world, where t~he· I.
wTifdom and goodness of the Creator are
cons icuous on every fide. The ma nifi-,
cence, the beauty and order of nature,
excite hzim to admire and adore. · When
he looks up to that invifiblae hand which
operates throughout: the universe, he is
~impressed with reverence. When he re-
ceives blessings which he cannot avoid a-
fecribing to divine goodnlefs, he is prompt-·
ed to gratitude. The exprefions of those
affe~tions under -the various fok-ms of re-
ligious worship, are no other than native
effufions of the human heart. Ignorance
may mislead, and f~uperflition may corrupt
them; but: their origin is derived from.
fecntiments th~at: are essential to man.

Caft-Fyour eyes over th~e whole earth,

E~xplore the most remote quarters of the
east or the weft. You ·may dis~cover tribe4
of men without policy, or laws, or cities,
lor anyp of the *arts of .life : ·But no wh~ere;
wtill ·you Aind themn without ifame f~orm of
religion . In every r~egion yoru behold the

proffrate

SE M. proffrate worshipper, the temple, the altar,

an h Oeig Wherever men have
existed, they have been fTenfible that some
acknowledgement was due, on their part,
to the Sovereign of the world. If in their-
rudest and most ignorant itate, this obli-
gation has been felt, what ad~ditional force
xnxult it ac quire by the improvements of
human knowledge, but especially by the
great dis~coveries of the Christian revela-
tion ? ~Whatever, either from reverence or
fr-om. gratitude, can excite men to the
worship of God, is by ~this revelation
placed in s~uch a light, as one should
think were fu~fficient to over-awe the most:
thoughtles~s, and to melt: the most obdu-
rEate mind.

Canst thou, then, pretend to be a manr

of reason, nay, a man of virtue, and yet
continue regardles~s of one of the first and
chief di~tates of human nature ? Wahere
is thy s~ensibility to what is right and fit,
if that loud voice which calls all nations
throughout the earth to religious homage,
has never been heard by thee ? Or, if it

nas

has b~een, heardi, by.wrhat firange and fals~e SER 14,
refinements haft thou f~ifled thos:e ·natural 1
sentiments which it tends to awaken ?
Calling thyfCelf a son, a citizen, a friend;
claiming to be ~faithful and affeationate
in these relations; haft: thou no s~ense of
what thou oweft to thy first: Parent, thy
highest Sovereign, thy greatest Benefac-
tor ? Can it be coniift~ent with true virtue
or honour, to value thys~elf upon thy re-
gard to inferiour obligati-ons, and yet to
v~iolate that w~hich is the most fCacred and
the most ancient of all ? When simple in-
flinca teaches the Tartar and the Indian,
together with his alms and good works to
join his prayers to that: Power wh~om he
considers as the source of good, shall1 it be
no reproach, in the most enlightened slate
of human nature, and under ithe purest
difpenfagtion of religion, to have extin-
guifhed the s~ens~e of gratitude to Heaven,
and to flight all acknowledgement of the
grea~t and the true God ? ·What does faxch
conduA imply, but either an entire want,
or wilful f~uppreflion, of some of the best

and

8 ER M. and most generous affeai~ons belonging to3

-v human nature ?-Surely, there must be

an ·efential defedt in that: heart~ which re;*
mains cold and insensible, where it ought
to be affedted mast warmly. Surely, fulch,
a degree of depravity must be lodged
there, as is fixfficient: to taint all the other
springs of pretended virtue.

Be *r bes ides this, I· muf 1 contenid, inl

the second place, That where religion: is
negle~ted, there can be no regular nor
iteady pradice of the duties of morality.
The charader will be often inconfxftent;
,and Virtue plac'ed on a basis too narrowc
Sto frp~port: it, will be always loose and
t~ottering. For fhuch is the propensity of
-our nature to vice, so numerous are the
~temptations to a relaxed and immnoral
condudt, that fionger restraints thair
thos~e of mere reason, are necessary to be
impos~ed on man. The sense of right and.
wrong, the principle of honour, or the
inftinat of benevolence, are barrie~rs too
feeble to withstand th~e firngth of pafflon.

X ~In

in th tra~nquil fCeafois of life, these natu- 8 ER 91
ral principles may, perhaps, carry on the W
ordinary courfre of social duties with some

reglarty.But wait until some trying

emergence come. Let the .conflift of
pafrions arifre. Let the heart be either
wounded by fore diffref~s, or agitated by
violent emotions ; and you shall Iprefsently
fee, that virtue without religion is inade-
quate to the g~ov~ernment: of life. It is d~e-
flitute of its p~roper guard, of its firmest
support, of its chief encouragement. It:
will fink under the wteight of misfortune;
or will yield to the solicitation of guilt.

The great motives that produce con-

flancy and firmness of allion, must be of
a palpable and firiking kind. A divine
Legislator, uttering his voice from heaven;
an omnis~cient Witness, beholding us in
all our retreats ; an almighty Governour,
firetching forth, his arm to punish or re-
ward, difelofing the secrets of the invisible
world, informing us of perpetual reft pre-
pared hereafter for the righteous, and of
indzgnartionz and wranth awaiting the wicked:

B . These

SER M. Thlere are the considerations whiich over-

~tI~Vawe the world, which support integrity,

anid check guilt. They add to vrirue that
solemnity wjhich should -ever char-a~erize
it. To the admonitions of cons~cience they
give the authority of :1 law. Co-operating
wvith all the good difipofitions of a pious
man, they firPengthen and infute their inz-
fluence. On his alms you can have no
certain dependence, who thinks not of
God, nor. has- joinedl prayer to his cha-
ritable deeds. But when ~humanity is f~e-
conded by piety, the fpyring· from which
it flows is rendered, of courfCe, more re-
gular, and conftant.--In short, w~ithdraw
religion, and you shake all the pillars of'
m~orality. In every hea~rt yTou weak~en the
influence of virtue: And among the mul-
titud~e, the bulk of mlankind, you over-
throw its power.

HAVING thus shewn· that morality

wiithou~t devotion is both defeative and
untable, I proceed to confider the other
extreme, of prayers wpithout' alms, devo-
tion waithouet morality.

In

In every age the pradice has prevailed, sER M.

of substituting certain appelarancesof piety ~;
in the place of the great duties of huma-
nity and mercy~. Too m-any there have
always been, who flatter themselves with
the hope of obtainaing the friendship of
their Creator, though they neg~led~ to do
juftic~eto their fello~w-creatures. But s~uch
persons may be assured, that their f~uppof-
ed piety is- altogether of a spurious kind.
It is an invention of their own, unknown
to reason, unknown in the word of God.
In fecripture we are ever direded dto try·
our faith by our works, our love of God
by our love of men. We are diredted. to
confider piety as a principle which rege-
nerates the heart, and forms it to good-
nes~s. We are taught, that in vain we ad-
dress any aats of homage to Christ, un-
less we do the thinzgsJ which he fajithS ; and
that love, peace, g~entleness, gaoodnefs, enceek-
ness and temperance, are not only the in-
jundious of his law, but the native fru~its
of hisJ~pirit *. If, therefore, while piety

Bz 2 eemsl

* Lkke vi. 4.6. Gal. v. 22,

8 ER M. s~eems ardent, morality shall decline, you

Irt;Yhave full reason to believe that into that

piety so~me corrupting ingredients have
entered. And if ever your regard to
morality shall totally fail; if, while you
mnake many prayers, you give no alms;
if', while you app~ear to be zealous for God,
you are false or unjust to men ; if you are
hard or contradted in heart, severe in your
cens~ures, and oppressive in your conduat;
then, conclude with certainty, that what
you had termed piety w~as no more than
an empty name. * For as soon, according
to the fecriptu~bre similitude, will bitter wea-
ters sow from a sweet founftain, or thiftles
become the fruit of the vine, as such es-
feats be produced by genuine piety.

Wrhat you have called by that name,

refblves itf'elf into one or other off three
things. Either it -is a hypoeritical form
of godlinefrs, afrumed in- order to imnpofe
on thle world; or, which is the most fa-
v~ourable fuzppofition, it is a transient im-
prefiron of ~erioufinefs, an accidental meltb
lag· of' the heart, which pafJeJ away like

the morning· cloucd and the early dew ; or, SER M.
which I am afraid is too often the cafe, c;
it. is the deliberate refug~e of a deluded
and fulperftitious, but at the f~ame time
a corrupted mind. For all men, even the
roost depraved, are; fubje£1, more or less,
to compun~tions of cons~ci~ence. It has$
never .been in their power to withdraw
totally be-yond the reach of that warning
voice, which tells them that: something is
nec3e~ssary to be done, in order to make
their peace with the Ruler of the world.
But, backward at the fame time to resign
the gains of difhoneity, or the pleasu~res
of vice; averse from fubmifion to that
sacred law which enjoins righteoufhefs
in its whole extent, they have often at~-
tempted to make a fort of composition
with Heaven; a composition, wh~ich,
thkough they dare not avow it in words,
lurks in s~ecret, at the bottom of many a.
heart. If God ·will only dispense with
some articles of obedience, they will re-
pay him with abundant homage. If they
fail in good~ praftice, they will fludy to

SE RM. be ·founld in belief ; and, by the. number

*~~ of their prayers, will atone, in some,

measure, for th~eir deficien~cy in charitable
deeds.

BuLt the attempt is as vain, as it is imn-

pious. From the- fim~pleRi and plaineR
pSrinciples of reas~on it muR~ appear, that
rel~igious worship, disjoined from ju~ice
and~ virtue, can upon no accoufnt what-
ever find acceptance with the Supreme
B~eing·. To zewhat: purpose is the multitude
of your facrifces unto mze ? ~fLaith the Lord.
Bring no more sain oblations. Incens~e is an
abomination unrto me2. The new moons and
fatbbaths, the callinzg of af0emnblies, I cannot
awac~y wpith ; 't. is iniqulity, even th~e Slemn
m·eeting *5~.- -Cease, foolifhl and impious
man ! Cease to confider the Ahlmighty as
a weak or vain-glorious bFeing, who is to
be appeas~ed by thy devout proitrations,
and thy humble words ; or to be gratified`
by the parade and Oitentaztion of external
w~orship. WVhat is all thy worfhip~to him ?
WTIll he eat the fleJh of thy facrif~ces, or
drink the blood of ofered goats ? Was wor-

t~hip required .as thee, dott thou think, sER M.
upon his ac~count, that thou mightert ;
-bring any inrcreafe to his glory and fIeli-
city by thy, weak and ingfigificant praires ?
Sooner mighteft thou iricreafe the ~p'len-
dour of the ·fun by a lighted taper, or adrd
to the thunder by thy voice. No: It is
for the; fake of man, not of God, that
worship an~d prayers are reqjuired·; not
that God may be rendered more glorious,
but that manl may be mad~e better ; that
he may be· confirmed in a proper ~sens~e of
·his dependent state, and acqluire thoere,
piours and virtuous dis~positions in hTi~ch
his highest improvement consists.

Of all the principles 'in religion, one

thould take this to be the mosT evidenlt;
and yet freqluent admonitions are needed,
to renew the impreflfion of it upon man-
kind. For what purpo~e did thy Creator
place thee in this world, in the midit ~of
human society, but that as a man among
men thou mighteft cultivate humanity;
that each in his place might con-tr~ibute to
thie general welfare; - that as a s~pous~e, a

8 ER M. brother, a son, or a friend, thou migh~teft
1/-~ gac thy part with an upright and a tender

heart; and thus aspire to res~emble Him
who ever consults the good of his creai-
tures, and whlof~e tender mercies are ovrer
all his *wrorks ? And dareft thou, who haft
been sacrificing unfufp~icious innocence to
Sthy loose pleafiires ; thou, who haft been
diflurbing the repole of bociety by thine
ambition or craft; thou, who, to increafie
thy tr~eas~ures, haft been mnaking the wi-
dow and the orphan weep; dareft. thou
approach God with thy worship and thy
prayers, and entertain the hope' that he
will look down upon thee in peace ? W~ll
the God of order and jufiie accept such
poor compens~ation for his violated laws ?'
Wlill the God of love regard the services·
of one who is an enemy to his cre-~atures. ?
Shall a corrupter of the society of menl
aspire to the habitations of pure and blef-
f~ed spirits ?-Beieve, it, H~e that faith he·
loveth God, any?2 love his brother al/o. Ccaji

I HAVE nlow ifhoven the evil of mazimr-

ing· and splitt~ing religion; of divciding
as~under two things, which though in
theory they m-ay be separated, yet in
prad~ice rimit always co-exist if either of
them be real, ~Devotion to God, and Cha-
rity to men. Let us confi~der next the~
hlappy effeats of their unio~n.

T~Pheir union forms thie consistent, tha

graceful, the refpedtable charader of the
real Christian, the man of true worth. If
you leave either of them~ out of your yT-;
flem, even though you excel in the other,
you can fland trial only in one point of
view. It is only on one fide your cha-
raAer is fair ; on the other, it will always
be open to much reproach. And as you
dishonour yours~elves, so you do great in-

C juficire

SER M. juffice to religion. For, by ~dividing its

I. parts from one another, you never fkil toi

expos~e it to the c~ensu~re of' the world : Andl
perh-aps, by this fort of partial and divid-
ed goodness, religion has fuffered more
in the effeem of mankind, than by open
profligacy. The unbeliever will fcoff'at
your piety, when he fees you negligent
of moral duties. The bigot will de-
cry all morality,. when hie fees you pre-
tendindg to be a follower of virtue, though
*you be a des~piser of G~od. Whereas 'he
~who fears God, and is at the f'ame time
just and beneficent to men, exhibits reli-
gion to the world with full propriety. It
th~ines in his condu~t with its native f~plen-
dour ; and its rays throw a glory round

hi~m.is charader is above reproach.
It is at once amiable and venerable. Mla-
lice itself is, afraid to attack him; and
even the worst men refped and honour
him in their hearts.

This too is the man whol~e life will b~e

.most peaceful and happy. He. who fails
materially either in piety or .in vir tue, is

always

;alwvtays obnoxious to the anguish of re- SERM:
anorfe. His partial gorodnefs may flatter *v
him in the day of s~uperficial obs~ervation ;
·but wvhen s~olitude or diffref~s awakens the
Tpowers of refleraion, he shall be made to
feel, that one part of duty performed,
atones not for another wh~ich is negleded.
In the midst of his prayers, the remem-
brance of injuffice will upbraid hiim with
hypocrifyT ; and in the diffribution of his
alms, the prayers which the poor put up
for himn will make him blufhl for his ne-
gleA of God. Conscience will s~upply the
place of the hand coming forth to write
over against him on the wall, Thjou art
*w~eighed in the b~al~ance, and art founld wa~nt-
ing *.. Whereas he who holds b~oth faith
and a good confcienzce, who attend s equal-
ly to the dis~charge of his duty towards
God and towards man, enjoys, as far as
human imperfedtion allows, the sease of
fatirnefs and consistency in condua, of in-
teg~rity and founldnef~s of heart.

The man of mere morality is a. firanger

to all the delicate and refined pleasures of

* Dan. v. 27. C deoin

8 ~ER M. devotion. In works -of beneficence· and

~V mercy, he may enjoy fatisfa~tion. But

his titisfadtion is destitute of that glow of
affeAion, which enlivens the feelings of
one who, ijfts his heart: at the f~ame time to
the Father of the universe, and considers
himself as imitating God. The man: a-
gain wTho rests solely on -devotion, if that
devotion open not his heart to humanity,
not only remains a firanger to the plea-
fures of beneficence, but must ofEten un-
dergo the pain arising from bad passions.
B~ut when beneficence and. devotion are3
united, they pour upo~n the man in whom
they meet, the furll pleas~ures of a good
and pure heart., H~is alms conne~ted
him with men; his ]prayers with God,
H~e looks withoixt dis~may on both worlds.
All nature has to hirnl a benign afped.
If engaged in a~ti've life, he is the
friend of men; and he is happy in the
exertions of that friendship. If ·left in
retirement, he walks among the works of
.nature, as with God. Every objea is en-
Iivened to hhn ~by the sense of the divine

p~resen7ce,

pretence. Every where he traces the be-' 8ER M.Z
neficent hand of the Author of nature; *·
and every where, with glo~wing heart,
he hears andi answers ~his s~ecret voice.
WThen he looks up to heaven, he rejoices
in the thought that there dwells that God
whom he s~erves and hondiars; that Sar
viour in whom he trusts ; that Spirit of
grace fr-om whos~e inspiration his piety and
his charityr sow. Wlihen he looks aroundt
him on the world, he is soothed with the ··
pl'eafing remembrance of good ofaces
wvhich he has done, or at least has fludied
to do, to many who dwell there. HI3ow
comfortable tlhe refleaion, that him no
poor manr can upboraid for having wtih-c~~
held his due; him no unfortunate man
can reproach for having seen and despised
his sorrows ; but that on his head are de-
fCcending the prayers of the needy and the
aged; and that the hands of thos~e whorn
his protedtion has s~upported, or his bounr
ty has fed, are lifted up in s~ecret to blef's

him ! -

8 ER M. Life pas fed under the influence of such

~v dispositions, naturally leads to a happy

end. It is not enough to fay, that faith
and piety, joined with adtive virtue, con-
flitute the requisite preparation for hea-
ven. They in truth begin the enjoyment~
of heaven. In every slate of our existence,
they form the chief ingredients of felicity.
Hence they are the great marks of Chri-
flian regeneration. They are the figna-
ture of that Holy Spirit, by wh~ich good
men are s~aid· to be fealEed ulnto the day of
redemzption.--The Text affords a firiking
proof of the estimation in which they are
held by .God. Amidst that infinitee va-
riety of human events which paf's under
his eye, the prayers and the alms of Cor-
nelius attraded his particular notice. He
remarked the amiable dispositions which
rose in the heart of this good man. But:
he sa~w th~at they were yet imperfelt,
while he remained unenlightened by the
principles ,of the Christian religion. In
order to remove this obitrucdian to his
rising graces, and to bring him to the full

knowledge

knowledge of that God whom he fought SER M.
to honour, he was favoured with a ifuper- ~~
natural message from heaven. While the
princes of the earth were left to adt by
t~he couns~els of their own wis~dom ; -while,
without interposition from above, Gene-
rals conquered or fell, according to the
viciflitude of' human things ; to this good
centurion an Angel was commiflioned
fr~om t~he throne of God.

Wihat can I f~ay more or higher in prais~e

of this blessed charadter, than that it is
what God delights to honour~ ?Men
single out as the. objeAs of diifindion,
the great, the brave, or the renowned.,
B~ut he who feeth not as mzan feeth, pas Eng
by thiofe quaities- which often shine with
sal~e splendour to human observation,
looks to the inward principles of adion;
to thos~e principles which form the essence
of a worthy charadter; and: which, if
called forth, would give birth to what-
ever is laudabl~e or excellent in conduG~t.
--Is there one, though in hiumble flation
or obscure life, who feareth God and work-

et ly

8 E RM. eth rig~hteous~ness; whose prayers and alms,

I- proceeding in regular unaff~edted tenour,

bes~peak the upright, th~e tender, the; de-
vout heart ?--Those alms and prayers
come up in memorial before that God
who is no r-e/pedter of perfonPs. The Al-
mighty beholds him from his throne
with complacency. Divine illumination
is ready to infiruat him. Angels mini-
fier to him. They now mark him out on
earth as their future associate; and for
him they make ready in paradis~e, the
wehite robes, the palmts, and the/ceptr~es of
the just~.

- To this honour, to trhis blef fednef~s, let:

our hearts continually as~pire ; and through-
out the whole of life, let those solemn and
sacred words, with which I conclude,
found in our ears, and be the great di-
reatory of our conduA : * He hath fIewed~
thee, O man, wehat is good ; and wehat doth
the Lord thy God require of thee, buct--to do
jus ly, and love m~ercy--and to w~alk humbly
naithf thy God ?

THE life of man has always been R SERM.

very mixed slate, full of uncertain- n.·

ty and vicxilitud~e, of ahxieties and fears.
In every religious au~dience, there are ma-
ny who fall under the denomination of
the unfortunate; and the reft are igno-
rant how soon they may be called to join
them. For the pros~perity of no man
on searth is fl~able and afiruedi. Dark

SE R M. clouds may soon gather over the heads ofe

~v those whos~e sky is now most bright. In

the midift of the deceitful calm which
they. enjoy, the florm that is to ·oPelr-
whelm them has perhaps already begun
to ferment. Ifa man live mtazy year-s, and
r·e70ace m1 themz all ; yet let him rememb~er
the days of darkneJFt, for they }hll be many *.

Hence, to a thoughtful mind, no Rtudy

can appear more important, than how to
be suitably prepared for the misfortunes
of life ; so as to contemplate them in pro-
fpedi without difmnay, and, if they rmuft
;befal, to bear them without dejecction.
Throughout every age, the wisdom of the
wife, the treafulres of the rich, and the
power of the inighty, have been employ-
ed, either in guarding their slate agamint
the approach of diffrefs, or in rendering
themselves less vulnerabole by its attacks.
Power has endeavoured to remove adver-
fity to a difl~ance. Philosophy has fludied,
when it drew nigh, to conquer it by pa-
tience 3 and Wealth has fought out every

*E Eaclef. xi. 8. pefr

pleafire that canl compenf~iate or alleviate S ER M.

While the wisdom of the world is thus

occupied, religion has been no les~s atten-
tive to the f'ame important objeat. It in-
forms us in the Text, of a pavuilion which
God ereats to fhbelter his servant~s in the
time of troucble, of a jecret place in his taber-
nacle into which he brings thnem, of a
rock on wehich5 he sets thbem ucp ; and els~e-
where it tells us, of a _/ield and an butckler
which he spre~ads before them, to co~ver^
them from the terroulr by night, and thbe arn-
row that f~ieth by da~y. Now, of what
nature are thos~e infirumnents of defence,
which God is reprefreated as providinag
with such s~olicit~ous care for t~hos~e who
fear him~ ? as he reared up any bul-
wrarkrs, impregnable by misfortune, in
order to fIeparate the pious and virtuous
fr~iom the reft of mankind, and to Ecreen
them from the common d~ifiafters of life ?
No : To thpfie difaf ters we behold them
liable no les~s than others. The· defence
which relig~ion provides, is altogether of

D 2 an

8 E R M. an internal kind. It is the heart, not the~

n.· outward trate, which it profeffes to guard.

'When the tim2e of troub~le comes, as comle-
it mufit to all, it places good men urider
the pavuilion of the Almighty, by afford-
ing them that security and peace which
aris~e from the belief of divine protedlion.
It brings them into the secret of his taber-
Inacle, by opening to them sources of con-
folation which are hiddien from others,
By that firength of mind with which it
endowms them, it sets theme up upiZo~n arock,
against which the tempest may violently
beat, but which it cannot shake.

How far the comfort~ts proceeding from

religion merit those high titles under
which they are here figuratively defecrib-
ed, I shall in this discourse endeavour to
show. I shall for this ~end compare toge-
ther the situation of bad men and that: of
the good, when both are f~uffering the
misfortunes of life ; ,and then rnake furch

I, RELIGION

I. RHLCON owprepares the mind for ·en- 8 ER M

countering, with fortitude, the most severe U.IpJ
shocks of adversity ; whereas vice, by its
natural- influence on the temperp, tends to
produce dejedion under the slightest tria~ls.
While wJorldlyJ men enlzarge their poffef'-
Hfons, and extend their conneAions, they
imagine that they are ~firengtheningr them-
·selves against all the possible vici~flitudes
of life. They· fy in their hearts, Mly moun-·
tain sand~s frong,, anzd I f~all nev~er be mov-
ed. But fe fa al is their delusion, that, in-
flead of ~firengthening, they are weaken-
ing that which only can su~pport them
when those vicissitudes come. It is their
mind which muff then s~upport them :
and their mind, by their sens~ual attach-
mnents, is corrupted and enif~eebled. Ad-
dided with intemperate fondrnefs to the
pleasures of the world, they incur two
great and certain evils; they -both ex- -
clude ·themselves from every resource
except th~e world, and -they increa~se their
s~ensibility to every blow which comes up-
on them from that quarter.

They

sER M. They have neither principles nor tem-

n. per which can stand the assault of trouble.

Thiey have no principles which lead them
to look beyond the ordinary rotation of
events; and therefore, wh~en misfortunes
involve them, the profpedt must be com-
fortlefs on every fide. Their crimes have
dis~qualified them for looking up to the
afifitance of any higher power than their
own ability, or for relying on any better
guide than th~eir own wisdom.- And as
f~romn principle they canl derive so furp-
port, so in a temper corrupted by profC-
perity they find no relief. They have
10f tha~t: moderation of mind wPhich en-
ables a wife manl to accommodate h~imself
to his situation. Long fed· with falf'e
hopes, they are exasperated and stung by
every dis~appointment, Luxurious and
effeminate, they can bear no uneasiness.
Proud and prefumptulous, they can brook
no opposition, By nourifhning difpoitions
which so little su~it this uncertain Rtate,
they have infus~ed a double portion of bit-
t~ernefs into the cup of woe; they have

sharpened

tharpened the .edge of that iiword which 8 ER II
is lifted up to fmnite them. Strangers to
all the temperate fatisfadions of a good
and a pure -mind; itrangers to every
pleasure except what was fCeafonedi by vice
or vanity, their adversity is to the last de-
gree disconsolate. Health and opulence
were the two pillars on which they refied.
Shake either of them; and their whole
edifice of hope and comfort falls. Prof-
trate and forlorn, they are left on the
ground; obliged to join wvith the man of
Ephraim in his abjea lamentation, T~hey
have taken awa~y my gods, wzahich I have
made, and wh~kat have I more * ?--Such are
the causes to which we must as~cribe the
broken spirits, the peevish temper, and
impatient passions, that so often attend
the declining age, or falling fortunes of
vicious men.

But how different is the condition ofa

truly good man in those trying situations
of life! Religion had gradually prepared
his mind. for all the events of this incon-
ftant Rate. It had infirudted him inthe

. ...nature

SJudges xvmi. 24.

8 ER M. nature of true .happinef~sr It had earlyp

nr. weaned haim from the undue love of the

world, by dis~covering to him its vanity,
-and by setting higher prospeCts in his
view. Afiftioins do not: attack him by
iurprif~e, and therefore do not overwhelmr
him. He was equipped for the florm, as
well as the calm, in this dubious naviga-
tion of life. UCnder thzofe cond~itions he
knew hims~elf to be brought hither, that
he was not to retain always the enjoy-
m~ent of what he loved : And therefore he
is not ov~ercome by disappointment, when
that which is mortal, dies; when that
which is mutable, begins to change; and
when that which he knew to be transient,
passes away.

All the principles which religion

teaches, and all the habits which it:
forms, are favourable to firength` of;
mind. It will: be found, that what-
ever purifies, fortifies also the-heart. In
the course of living rig~hteously, Sokerly and
g~odcly, a good man acquires a fleady and
well-governed spirit. Trained, by Di-

2 vine

vine grace, to enjoy with moderatioil thes SER Ma
advalilages of th~e world, neither lifted up E-J
by fu~ccef's, nor enervatedf with s~ensuality,
he meets the changes in his lot without-
unmanly dejection. He is inured to tem-
p~erance and refiraint.· . He has learned-
firmness and ~felf-comnmand. He is ac-
cuff~omed to look up to t-hat Supreme
Providence, which dispos~es of human as-
fai;rs, not with reverence only, but with
trust and hope. -

The time of prosperity was to hirn not

merely a s~eason of barren joy, but pro-
duftive of mauch.uf~eful. improvem~ent.
H~Te had cultivated. his mzind. H-e hadE
flored it with ufefill knowledge, with
good principles, and virtuous difpofi--
tions. There resources remain entire,
when the days of trouble come. Th·ey ·
remain with him in E~cknef~s, as in
health; in poverty, as in the midst of
riches ; in his dark itud foltary hours,
no lef's than when T~urrounded~ wiTth·
friends and gay society. From the glare
of prosperity, he can: wvithout deje~tion, ·

E ithdraw~T~

5 ER M. withdraw into the shade. Exrcluded!

II- from f'everal advantages· of the world .

he may be obliged; to retreat into a nar-
rower circle; but with~in that circle he
will find many comforts left. His chief
pleafuxres· were always of the calm, in-
nocent, and temperate kind; and over
t~hes~e, thle changes of the world have the
'leaft power. H~is mind is a kingdom to
him; and he can still· enjoy it. The
world did not beffow upon him all his
enjoyments ; and: therefore it is not in
the power of the world, by its most cruel
attacks, to carry them all away.

II. THE diff~reffes of life are a~lleviatedt

to good men, by refle~tions on their past
condu& i while, by s~uch refleaSions, they
are highly aggravated to the bad. During:
the gay and adtive periods of life, sinners
elude, in some measure, the force of con-
s~cience. Carried round in the whirl of
as fairs and pleafurTes ; intent on contriv-
ance, or eager in purfixit; amused by hope,
or elatedl by enjoyment; they are sheltered

by

biy that croud of trifles which su~rrounds sER M·
them, from serious thought. But con- II.
:Ccience is too great a power to remain
always su~ppressed. There is in every
man's life, a period when he ihall be
made to fland forth as a real objeat to
his own view : And when that period
comes, Wo to him who is galled by the
fight ! In the dark and solitary hour of
diffreifs, with a mind hurt and fore from
some recent wound of fortune, how shall
he bear to have his charaater for the first
time difelof~ed to him, in that humiliating
light under which guilt will necessarily
prefieat it ? Then, the recolle~tion of the
past becomes dreadful. It exhibits to him
a life thrown away on vanities and follies,
or confirned in flagitioufnef~s and fin; no
Rtation properly supported ; no material
duties fulfilled. Crimes which once had
been easily: palliated, rife before him in
their native deformify. The s~ense of guilt
mixes itf'elf with all that has befallen him.
He beholds, or thinks that he beholds,
the hand of the God whom he hath of-

E 2 fended,

&*E.R M. ifended, openly firetched out agairi~ft himr.

n.· - At a season when a man ft~ands-moft in

need of support, howv intolerable is the
weight of this additional load, aggravat-
ing the depreflion of disease, disappoint-
ment, or old age ! How mis~erable his
slate, who is condemned to endure at once
the pangs of guilt, and the vexations of
calamity ! Th~e Jpirit of a mnan may fuf-Jaina
his infrmrnities ; bult a wounded /pirit, who
can bear ?

Whereas, he who is bjlefled with ar clear

cons~cience, enjoys', in the worst conj-unc-
tures of humlan life, a peace, a dignity,
an elevation of mind, peculiar to virtue.
The testim~ony of a good ·conscience is
indeed to be always diitinguifhed from
that prefixmptuous boast of innocence,
which every good Christian totally dif~-
claims. The better he is, he will be the
more bumbole, a~hd s~ensible of his failings.
But though' he acknowledge that he can
claim nrothizg· fr-om God upon the foot-
ing of de~sert, yet he can trufit in his mer-
ciful acceptance through Jefls. Christ, ac-

the improvemnent which he madce 'of thofre
advantages· while they lasted, the temnpe-
rate spirit with which he enjoyed them,
the beneficent adions which he per-fbrrm·-
ed, and the good example which he s~et to ·
others, remain behind. `By the memory
of the~re, he enjoys his prosperity a fe-·
cond time in refle~ion ; and perhaps this
~second and refle~ed enjoyment is not in-
feriour to the firit. It arrives at a mo-re
.critical and n~eedful time. It aiffords h~imi
the high fatisfa~tion of having extra~tde

which to the u~pright make Aight· arise in
darnE·e/s; refle~tions which chear the
lonely hous~e of virtuous poverty, and at-
tend the conscientious fuff~erer into prison
or exile; which sooth the complaints of
grief, lighten the preflbre of old age, and
furnish to the bed of sickness, a cordial
of more grateful relish, and more fove-
reign' virtue, than any which the world
can as Ford. -p

Look abroad into life, and you will

find the general sense of mankind bearing
witness to this important truth, that mind
is f~uperiour to fortune; that what one feels
within, is of much greater importance
than all that befals him without. Let a
man be brought: into some s~uch fTevere
.and trying situation, as fixes the attention

of the publick on his behaviour. The SER M
first question which we put concerning I
him, is not, What does he f~uffer ? but,
How does he bear it ? Has he a quiet:
mind ? or, Does he appear to be un-
happy within ? If we judge him to be
compos~ed and firm, resigned to Provi-
dence, and s~upported by cons~cious inte-
grity, his charadter rifies, and his mi~sery
lfeffens in our view. Wre efleem and ad-
mire, rather than pity him. RecolledS
what holy men have endured for the f~ake
of cons~cience, and with what chearfulnef's
they have f~uffered. On the other hand,
when cons~cience has concurred with out~-
ward misfortunes in diffrefling the guilty,
think of the dreadful consequences which
have ens~ued. How often, upon a reverse
of fortune, after abus~ed prosperity, have
they madly hurried themselves over that
precipice from which there is no return;
and, in what nature most abhors, the vo-
luntary extin-i~ion of life, have fought re-
lief from that torment of refler~ion, wvhich
was become too great for them to bear ?

N~ever

S ER M. Never then asllow yourselves to imnagine:

II. that misfortunres alone form the. chief'

mis~ery o~f man. N~one but the guilty! are
comnpletely mis~erable. The mif'giving and
distrust, the accusa~tions and reproaches of'
their minds, the sense of having drawn
down upon their heads the evils which·
they f~uffer, and the terrifying expedation
of more and worfie evils to come; these
are the eiFential ingredients of human
misery. They not only whet thEe edge,
but they envenom the darts of afTliftion,
and a~dd poison to th~e wound. Whereas,
when mnisfortunes assail a good man, they
carry no s~uch fatal auxiliaries in their
train. They may rus~e the s~urface of
his foul; but there is a strength within,
which resists their farther imprefiion. The
conflitution of his mind is fiound. The
world can inflift upon it no wounds, but
what admit of cure.

overpower: its firength, it relies no longer
on its~elf. It casts eve~ry where around, a
withing, exploripg eye, for fouxse thelter to
screen, some power to uphold it ; aind if,~
when abatndoned ,by the 'world, it can
find nothing to which it may fly in the
room of the world, its, slate is truly for-
lorn. Now, whither should the ungodly,
in this situation, turn for aid ? After hav-
ing contendjed.with the florms .of adverse~
fortune till their spirits are exthauffed,
gladly would they retreat at last .to the
fanauary of religion. But that. fagnduary
is ihult against them; nay, it is environed
with terr·ours. They behold there, not a
Protedor to whom they· can fly, but a
Judge whom they dread; and in those
moments .when they need his friendsh~ip
the soft, they are reduced to deprecate
his wrath. If he once called wzehen they
r~efused, and stretched qzt his hands. when

But of all t~he tho~ughts; which can enter

into the mind, in the season of diffref~s,
the belief of an inte'reft `in his favour

Every form' of religion has affoprded to
virtuaou's Iepe some degree of this confo-

2 iincorruptible,·

ricorrulptble, unefiledl, and that fadeth not -sE it l
away. Justly is this hope ftiled in Efcrip- n.
ture, the anchor of the Soul, both sure anmd
fedff3. For what an ainchor is to a ship in
a dark night, on an unknown ,coait, and
amidst a boifferous ocean, that is this
hope to the foul when diffra~ted by the
confusions of the world. In danger, it
gives security; amidst general fluanation,
it: affords one fixed point of reft~. It is in-
deed the mot ~emninent of all the advan-
tages which religion now confers. For,
confid~er the mighty power of hope over
the human mind. It: is the univers~al
comforter. It is the s~pring of all human
adtivity. U fpon futurity, men are con-
flantly s~uspended. Animated by the pro-
sp~ed of some d~itant good, they toil and
ifufer' through the whole cours~e of life.;
and it is not so much what they are at
present, as what they hope: to be in fomet
after time, that enlivens their motions;
fixes attention, and flimulates. induffry.
Now, if in the commnon affagirs of life such
is the energy of hope, even when its obje&

G is

8ER M. is neither very considerable, nor very ceri-

II. tain - what effeAs may it not be expedted

to produce, when it rests upon an objea
so iplendid as a life of immortal felicity ?
Were this hope entertained with that full
perf~uaflon which Chrifi~an faith demands,
it would:, in truth, not m1-erely alleviate~,
but totally annihilate, all human mis~eries.
It would banish dis~content, extinguish
grief, and s~uspend the v~ery feeling of pain.

But allowing for the mixture of human

frailty; admitting thofek abatements which
our imperfe(Tion makes upon the effeld of
every religious principle, still you will
find, that in proportion to the degree inrm
which the hope of Heaven operates upon
good men, they will be tranquil under
fufferings ; nay, they will be happy, in
comparison of those who enjoy no such
relief. What indeed, in the courfei of hu-
man affairs, is filfficient to diffrefs, far
less· to overwhelm, the mind of that man
who can look down on all human things
from an elevation s~o much abovce them ?
He is only a passenger through this world.,

H~e

He is travelling to a happier , country.AS ER M.
How difa reeable soever the occurrences , U
of his journey may be, yet, at every fla~ge ;
of that journey, he receives the afirxrance
that he is drawing· nearer and nearer to
the· period of reft and felicity.L-Endure,
and th-oua shalt overcome. Pers~evere,
and thou shalt be fiucef~sful. The time
of trial hastens to a close. Thy mansion
is prepared~ above; thy reft remaineth
among the people of God. The disorders
whichn vice has introduced into the works
of God, are about to terminate; and all
tears are soon to be wiped away from the
eyes of the juft~.--The firm aixurance of
this happy conkclufiona to the vexations and
the vanities of life, works a greater effedt
on the sincere illiterate Christian, than all
the refinements of philosophy can work
on the most learned Infidel. These may
gratify the mind that is at ease; may
sooth the heart when slightly difcompo-r- I·
ed; but when it is fbjre and deeply torn, I
when bereaved of its best and most a
beloved comforts, the only consolations ?

G 2 that

S R M. that c~an then find acces~s, arise f~romn

nT. the hope of a better world ; ·where those

comfbres fhzall be again reffored; and all
the virtuous shall be assembled, in the
presence of him who made them. Such
hopes banish that despair which over-
whelms, and leave only that tender meT
lancholy which softens the heart, and
o~ften renders the whole charade~r more
gentl~e and amiable,

Or this nature are the resources wrhich-

religion provides for good men. By~ its
previous discipline, it trains them to for-
~titude; by the refleAions of a good con-
ficience it fiooths, by the fCenf~e of Di~vine
favour it s~upports themz; and when every
comfort fails them on earth, it! chears
them with the hope of Heaven. Diftin-
guifhing his fCervants with such advanta-
g~es, God is justly s~aid to ereA his pavilion
over them ir> the evil time. He not only
spreads a tent for them in the weilderne/s,
but he transforms in some m~eafuwre the
flt~re Of nature arouxnd them. To use the

b~eautifu~l

Jbeautifrl- language of antient pro~phecy; SER M,
In the defart, the thirty land~, wvhere no Fs

~fiead of the briar, the myrtle to spring·. In
mid}Z of the habitation of dragons, hea makes
green paf~ures r~fe, and f~ill waters jfowe
around his people.

THE improvemnent to be made of the~se

truths, is as obvious, as it is important.
Let us fludy so to conduct our lives, that
wre may be qualified for dleriving fihch
conkfolations from relig~ion. To their rea-
lity, and their import~ance,, all mank-ind
bear witnes~s. For no sooner are they
overtaken by diffref~s, than to religion
they fly. This, throughout every age,
has been the univers~al th~elter which the
young and the old, the high and the low,
the giddy andgthe s~erious, have fought· to
gain, as soon as they found that: reft could
be no where elfle procured for the weary
head, or the aching heart. But amidst
thos~e multitudes that croud to religion

for

8 ER M. for relief, how few are entitled to ap-

U. proach that sacred source of comfort ?

On wh~at feeble props do their hopes and.
pretenflons reft ? How much fuperflition
mingles with that religion to which men
are driven by diffrefs and fear ?-You
must first apply to it as the guide of life,
before you can have recourse to it as the
refuge of sorrow. You must fhibmit to
its legi-slative authority, and experience
its renewing influence, before you can
look for its consolatory effeA. You must
fCecure the tefitimony of a good 'conf~cience,
and: peace with God through Jesus Chlrift;
otherwis~e, when thefloo0ds Jhall come, and
the rains defcendc, and the weinds blowe, the
houfie which; you had proposed for your
retreat, shall prove the hou~e fou~ndedt on the
sa~nd, not on the rock.

TShere are two plans, and there are but

two, on w~hich any man Canl propos~e to
conduat himfielf through th~e dangers and
dliffreffe~s of human life. The one is the
plan of worldly wis~dom; the other, that
of determined adhere~nce· to conscience.

He who aats upon the former, lays prin- SER M
ciple aside, and trusts his defence to his ~;
art and ability. He avails hims~elf of
every advantage which his knowledge of
the world s~uggests. H-e attends to nothing
but wphat he considers as his interest ;
and, unconfined by conscience, pursues it
by every course which promises him fulc-
cess. This plan, though too often adopt-
ed, will be found, on trial, ineffeAual and
deceitful. For human ability is an un-
equal match for the violent and unfore-
seen vicissitudes of the world. When
thef'e torrents ri~e .in their might, they
sweep away in a moment the bankes which
worldly wif'dom had reared for defence,
and overwhelm alike the crafty and the
artlef's. In the mean time, persons of this
charader condemn themselves to live a
mast unquiet life. They pas~s their days
in perpetual anxiety, listening to every
motion;~ i fartled by every alarm ; chan-
ging their -measures on every new occur-
rence; and when diffref~s breaks in over
all their defences, they are: left under it,
hopeles~s and dis~consolate.

The

E ER M. , The: plan which, in ~opposition, to thfis

"* religion recommends, as both more ho-

nourable in its~elf,~ and more effedtual for
·security, is, at ~all hazards, to do your
duty, and to leave the cons~equences to
God. Let him who would ad upon this
plan, adopt for the rule of his conduCd,
that maxim of the Pfalmift's, TrufJ in the
Lor-d, and do good*., To firm integrity,
let him join a humble reliance on God.
Let his adherence to duty, encourage his
religious runit. Let his religious trust,
inspire him with fortitude in the per-
formance of his duty. Let him know
no path but; the firaight and dire&t one.
In trhe most critical moments of aAion,
let him afki no further questions, than,
What is the right, the fit, the worthy~
part ? How as a man, and as a Christian,
-it becomes him to ad~ ? Having received
the decision of conscience, let him commit
his iunop unto the Lor-d. Let him, without
trepidation or wavering', proceed` in dif4
charging his duty ; resolved, that though
the world may make him unfortunate, it

fhalll never make him bas~e; and confidi- E ERM.
ing that in what -God and his cons~cience U.~
re quire him to aA or sus ser, God and a.
good confe6ience will support him.------
Such principles as thef, are -the best pre-
paration for the vicissitudes of the human
lot. They are the fhiedJ of inward peace.
He who thinks and aas thus, shall be
exposed to no> wounds but what religion
can cure. H~e may feel the blows of-
adverfijty; but he shall not know teE~
wPounds of t~he h~eart.

E.R M. THE happy influenrce of religion
III. . upon human life, in the time of

adversity, has been considered in th~e
pre6eding discourse.~· Concerning this the
f'enti~ments of men are more generally
agreed, than with refpe £t to- some other
prerogatives which relig~ion claims. They
very readily afi~gn to it the office of a
Comforter. But as long as their slate is
pros~perous, they are apt to account it an

unnecefrary

unneeif~ary guest~, perhaps an unwielcome SER M.
intruder. Let us not be thus unjust to In.J
religion, nor confine its importance to one
pe~riod only in the life of man. It was
never intended to be merely t~he rnurfe of
sicknes~s, and the ftaffof old age. I pur-
pose now to show you, That it is no less
essential to th~e enjoyment of pro-sperity,
than to the comfort: of adversity : That
prosperity is pros~perous, if we may be al-
lowed the exprefiron, to a good man only;
and that to every other person, it will
prove, notwithstanding its fair appear-
ance, a barren and joyleis itate.

The Psalmist, in the Text, by an image

taken from one of the most beautiful
objed~sin natuxre, defecribes a man who
flourishes in fuxll prosperity. But to whom
is the defeription limited ? To him,
as the preceding verses inform us, that
wealketh not in the counfal of the ung~odly,
nor f2andeth in the way of fnners, nor itteth
in the feat of the Jcprnful, but hath his de-
Aight in the law of God. He only is likfe

In confirm-iat~ion of this do~trine, I sha~ll
lay before you, th~me of thofie c'ircuin-
stances which distinguish the profperrity
oss the g~ood man beyond that of thne fin-

nothing· of this kind can affedc the int-er-

v-ours are wholly disinterested; and with
a gratitude the most: cordial and unfurfpi-
clous, a good man looks up to that Al-
mnighty Ben~efadSor, who aims at no e~nd
but the happin-ess of th~ose whom he blef~-
f~es, and. who desires no return fr-om them,
but a devout and thankful ~heart. W~hile:
others can trace their prosp~erity to no
higher source than a conzcurrence of world-
ly causes, and, often, of mean or trifinig
incidents, which occaflonally sav oured their
d~efigns;a with what fulperiour fatisfadtion
d~oes the servant of God remarlk th~e hand
of that gracious Power which hath r~ais~ed
him up ; which hath happily conduated
himr thlrough theC variouls ItePS of life, and
crowned hirm with th~e muof favourable
diftincion beyond his eqiuals ?

Let

& ER M. Let us farther confider, that not only

~I~~LI gratitude for the past, but a chearing

fenfie of God's favour at the pres~ent, en-
ters into the pious emotion. They are
only the virtuous, who in their pros~per-
ous days hear this voice addressed to
them : Go ·thy ·way, eat thy bread with joy,
and drink thy wine weith a merry hteart ; for
Glod now accepteth thby wuorks*i. H-e who is
the Author of their prosperity, gives them
a title to enjoy, with complacency, his
own gift. While bad men snatch the
pleasures of the world as by flealth, withT
out countenance from God the proprietor
of the world; the rig~hteous fit openly
down to the feare of life, under the smile~
of approving Heaven. No guilty fears
damp their joys. The blessing of God
rests upon all that they possess~; his pro-
tedion s~urrounds them; and hence, in
the habitationss of the righteouts, is foucnd ·the
·voice of rejoicing azd falvration. A luffre
unknown to others, invests, in.their fight,
thie whole face of nat-ure. Their piety re-
fleets a s~un-shine from heaven upon the

proiiperity

prosperity of the world ; unites in one stR Ml.
point of view, the smiling afped both of HEi~
the powers above, and of the obje £ts be-
low. Not only have they as full a relish
as otEhers, of the innocent ·pleasures of
life, but, moreover, in thes~e th~ey hold
commu~ion with God. In all that is
good~-r fair, they trace his hand. From
the beauti~es of nature, from the improve-
ments of art, from the enjoyments of so-
cial life, ·they rais~e their affe~tion to the
source of all the happines~s which f~ur-
rounds them; and thus widen the s~phere
of their pleafulres, by add~ing intelleftural,
and spiritual, to earthly _joys.

For illuff~ration of wphat I have faidc ·on

this head, remark that chearfu~l enjoyment
of a pros~perous slate which King David
had, when he wrote the twenty-third
Psalm; and compare the higheflt pleafixres
of the riotous fianer, with the happy and
satisfied spirit which breathes throughout
that Pf~alm.--In the midit of the fplen-
dour of ro~yliity, with what amiable fimt-
plicity of gratitutde does he loo~k up to the

peculiar fecurityt in the enijoymnent of their

after his fituat~ionr in the world has be-

off tch a situation is most uncertain.
From a variety of ca-uses, he lies open to
change. On many sides he f~ees that he
may be pierced; and the wider his co~m-
fo~rt extend, the broader is the markr
wvhich~ he fprieads to the arro~ws of misfor-
tune. H Tence many a fearet aa~i-rrm to the

uI~f~vall such alarms, the real danger increases,

in proportion to their- imp~rovident fe-l
cu~rity,

By worldly affillance it~ is vain to think

of providing any effectiual de~fence, feeing
the wyorld's mutability is the very caus~e
of our terrour, It is fromz a higher prin-
ciple, from a power f~uperiour to the-
world, that reliefmuft be fought, amnidft:
fiich difq~uietudes of the heart. He who
in his prosperity canl look up to One who
is witness to his moderation, huFmanity,
and charity; he wrho can appeal to, Hea-·
ven, that he has not been· elated by pride,.
nor overcome by pleafixre, but; has fludi-
ed to employ its gifts to the honour of
the giver; this man, if there be any truth,
in religion, if there be any benign~ity or
goodness· in the adminiffiiration of the
uzniverfle, has fomewphat to reft upon for
fCecurity and hope.. Not: that an intereftr
in the Divine -grace will perpetuate to a
good man,· nore than to others, a life of
unruffied pros~perity, Change and altera-

tion

Qion form the very essence of th-e world. 8 ER M.
But let the world change around him at In.
pleafare, he has ground to hope that it
thall not be able to makre him unhappy.
Wlhatever may vary, God's providence is
Htill the fame·; and his love. to the righ~-
taeous remains unaltered. If it: shall be
the Divine will to remove one .comfort·,
he trusts that some other shall be given.
Whatever is given, whatever is taken
away, he confid~es, that in the laif refixut
all }hal~l work for his good.

Hence, he is not diflurbed, li'ke bad

men, by the instability of the world.
Dangers, which ov>ercome o~thers, thake
n~ot his more th~eady mind. He enjoys the
pleasures of life pure and unrallayed, be-
caus~e he enjoys them, as long as; they
last, without anxious terrours. They are
not his all, his only good. He welcomnes
them when they arrive; and when they
pass away, he can eye them, as they de-
part, without agony or despair. His
prosperity firikes a deeper and firmer
root than that of the ungodly. And for

I 2 this

SER M. this reason he is compared, in the Text,

~v to a tree planted -by the rivers of water ;

a tree, whose branches the .tempest may
indeed bend, but ·whose roots it cannot:
touch; a tree, ~which may occasionally
be firipped of its leaves and bloffams,
but which flill maintains its place, and
in due se~ason flouriifhes ane~w. WThereas

power of the world to beffowv; surround mI.
hima with riches; crown him with ho-
nours ; invest him, if you will, with abi-
sol-ute ·dominion; but leave him at the
fame time under some s~ecret opprefflon or
heavines~s of heart; you beffow indeed
the materials of enjoyment, but you de-
prive him of ability to extra~t it. You
set a se~as before him, but: he wants the
power of tasting it. H-ence pros~perity is.
so often an 'equivocal word,' denoting
merely afftuence of pofefi~on, but une
juflly applied to the miserable poffeffor.

We all know the effedis which any

indifpioftion of the body, even though
flig~ht, produces on external pros~perity.

regular, and the virtuous, know how -to
enjoy prosperity. They bring to its com-
forts the manly relish of a found uncor-

by contintrance, to fade; of most of UL~
them, to cloy. Hence, in the most pro-
fp~erous itate, there are fr~equ-ent intervals
of languor, and even of dejed~ian. There
are vacuities in the happiest life, which it
is not in the p~ower of the world to fill
up. What relief so adapted to thos~e va-
cant or dejeated p~eriods, as the pleasing
hopes which aris~e from immortality ?
How barren and imperfed that profpde-
rity, which can have recours~e to no such
funbfidiary comfbrt, in order to animlate
the stagnation of vulgar life, and to
supply the infuffidiency of worldly plea-
f~ures !

Worldly pros~perity declines with de-

clining life. In youth, its relish was
brifkr and poignant. It becomes more
sober as life advances ; and flattens as
life descends. He who lately overflowed
with gay s~pirits and high hopes, ~begins
to look back with heaviness on the days
of former years. He thinks of his old
companions who are gone; and reviews-

pleas~ures, one after ano~ther, thus fleal
treacherously away, what can he, who is
an utter firanger to relig~ion, and to the
hope of Heaven, substitute in their place ?
-But even in that drooping period, the
promis~es and hopes of religion support
the fipirits of a good man till the latest
hour. His leaf, it is sTaid in the Text,
}h5all not *wither. It shall not be in the
power of time to blafti his pros~perity :
'But old ag~e shall receive him into a quiet
retreat, where, if lively s~ensations fail,
gentle pleas~ures remain to sooth him.
That hope of immortality, which former-,
ly improved his other enjoyments, now is
a great mneaf~ure fiipplies their absence.
Its importance rises, in proportion as its
object draws near. He is not forifaken
by the world, but retires from it with

tranquillity over the old age of: the righ-
teous man. TIhey make the evening of
his days go down un clouded ; and allow
the fiream of life, though fallen low, to
run clear to thle last drop.

THUs I have shown, I hope, with full

evidence, what material ingredients reli-

pros~perity of life. Separated from them,
prosperity, how fair soever it: may ihow

noxious to the poffeffor : United w~ith
them, it rises into a real blessing beffowed

m.I fCeries into which the· abut'e of their con-

dition is likely to betray them, and call-
ing upon them to beware of the dangers
with which they are threatened.

It is unfortunate for mankind, that

those: situations which favour pleas~ure,
are too generally advTerfe to virtue. Vi~r-
tue requires internal government: and
discipline; pros~perity relaxes the mind,
a~nd inflames the paflions. Virtue is
supported by a regard to what is future;
prosperity attaches us wholly to what is
prFefent. The charaterificiks of virtue,
are modesty and humility; the most com-
mean attendants of prtofp~erity, are pride
and pres~umption. One should think, that
profiperity would prove the firongeft in-
citemnent to remember and to honour that:
God who beffows it. Yet fucrh is the per-
verf~enefs of human nature, that it proves
much oftener the motive to impiety. The
changes of the world call the attention' of
men to an Inv~isible Power.' But a train
of events proceeding according: to their

writh,

wcifh, leads them to nothing beyond what SER M.
they fee. The Supreme Giver is conceal- III.
ed from view by his own gifts. Th~is in-
stance of s~uccess they ascrib2e ·to a fortu-
nate concur~rene of w~orldly caufies; that
acquisition, to their- own skill and indu-
firy ; unmindfunl of him, who from the
beginning arranged that s~eries of caus~es,
and who placed them in circumst~ances
where their induffry could operate with
succe~ss. From forgetting God, they too
often proceed to depifiie him. All that is
light or giddy in their minds, is set in
motion by the gale of pros~peri~ty. Arro-
gance and felf-fiuffciency are lifted up;
and their slate is considered, as secured
by their ownfitrength. Hence that pride
of coutntenance through which the wicked
in their prosperity, as David obs~erves, re-
fuf'e to seek after God. They are deferibed
as fpekakng loftily, and f tting~ their moucth
against the Heavens. ~The~y take the timbrel

you multiply the dangers which already

~For notew wee Se through a glass, d~arkly.--

T HE Apostle here deferibes the imn- 8ER M.

perfedion of~ our knowledge with '

relation to ~spiritual and eternal obJjeAs.
He employis two metaphors, to represent
more th~ongly the disadvantages und~er
which we lie : One, that we f~ee thoe~ o~b-
jeats through a g~lass, that is, through the
intervention of a mnedium whlich d~bfcures
their glory; the other, that we fCee them
in a r·iddle or enigma, which 9ur trantia-
tors have rendered by feceinga them dark~ly,
rthat is, the truth in part di~c~overed, in

parc

8 ER M. part concealed, and placed beyond out·

IV. comprehension.

This defeription, however just and true,

canlnot fail to occasion som~e perplexityt
to an enquiring mincl. For it mhay seem
firange, that to much darkness thould be
left upon thos~e celeffial objeAs, towards
which wve are at: t'he fagme time command-
-ed to aspire. We are firangers in the
univerf'e of God. Confined to that s~pot
on which we dwell, we are permitted to
know nothing of' what is tr-an~faa5ing 16
the regions above us and around us. By
much labour, we acquire a fup~erfcial
acquaintance with a few sensible obje~i~s
which we find in: our pref~ea habitation I
but we enter, and we depart, under a to-
tal ignorance of the nature and laws of
the s~piritual world, One fijbjea in par-
ticular, when our thoughts proceed in this
train, must often recur upon the mind
with peculiar anxiety ; that is, the ima-
mortality of the foul, and the future ita~te
of man. Exrpofed as we are at pres~ent to
such a variety of afnidtions, and fulbjecied

to so much disappointment in all our pur- S ER 19.
fulits of happines~s, W~hy, it may be said, IV-
has our g~racious Creator denied us the
consolation of a full dis~covery of our fu-
ture exis~tence, if indeed th~ch an existence
be prepared for us ?-Reason, it is true,
su~ggests many arguments in behalf ~of
-immortaity : Revelation gives full afirur-
ance of it. Yet even that Gospel which
is fagid to have broug~ht i~fe anld imnmortality
to hight, allows us to fee only throucgh a
glass darkly. . ITt doth not yet appear *what
*we }all be. Our knowledge of a future
world, is very im-perfeA; our ideas of it,
are faint and confuse~d. It is not disp~lay-
ed in such a manner, as to make an in-·
prefilon fuxited to. t~he importance of the
obje(5. The faith even of the best men,
is much inferiour, .both in clear-ness and~
in force, to the evidence of sense; and
proves, on many' occasions, inf~ufficient2
to counter-balance the temptations of
the pref~eat world. Haplpy moments in-
deedi there sometimes are in thle lives of
pious men, when fequeffered from worl-d-

SER M. ly cares, and born up on the wings of

-V divine contemplation, they rife to a near

and transporting view of immortal glory.
But futch e~fforts of th~e mind are rare, and
cannot be long su~pported. When the
spirit of meditation fuzbfdes, this lively
sense of a future Rtae decays; and though
the general belief of ·it remain, yet even
good men, when they return to the ordi-
nary bufiinefs and cares of life, seem to
rejoin the multitude, and to re-afixume
the fame hopes, and fears, and interest~s,
which influence the reft of the world.

Fro1 s~uch refleations, a considerable

difficulty refpeding this important s~ub-
je&, either arises, or s~eems to arise. W~as
f~c~h an obscure and impedfed~ dificovery
of another life worthy to proceed from
God ? Does it not afford some ground,
either to tax his g~oodnes~s, or to fur~ped
th~e evidence of its corising from him ?-
This is the point which we are now .to
colnfider; and let us confider it with that
close attention which the fiubjeA merits·.

-Let us enqui're, whether we have any

a re afon,

resfon, either to compl~ain of Provid~ence, s·ER- M.
or to objea t~o· the evidence of a fu~ture *V
sta~te, becaus~e that evi~dence is riot of a
modre ~enfible and firiking nature. Let
us attempt Ihumbly to trace the reason-s,
why,· though· permi~tted to knowc~ and to
fee somewhat of the eternal world, we are
nevertheless permitted on-ly' to knzowe in
part, and to/ee throcg~h a glasS~, darkly.

IT. plainly appears to be the plan of

~the Deity, in all his dif~penfa~tions, to mix
light with darkunef~s, evidence with uncer-
tainty. Whatever the reasons of this pro-
cedurre be, the fa&T is undeniable. He is
des~cribed in the Old Testament, as a God
that hideth himself *. Clouds and darkne/s
are said to surround hini. His way is tin the
sea, and his path in the g~reat wvaters ; his
footf2eps are not known. Both the works
and the ways of God are full of myfiery.
In the ordinary cours~e of his government,
mnnumerable events occur which perplex
us to th~e utmost. There is a. certain limit
.to all our enquiries in religion, beyond

1VI which

8ER M* which if we attempt to proceed, we are

~v~Vloft in a maze of inextricable diflcutica:

Even that revelation which affordss such
material infirudtion to man, concerning
his duty and his happiness, leaves many
doubts unresolved. Why it was not given
sooner; why not to all men; why there
thould be so many things in it·hard ~to be
undelt~ood, are difficulties not inconfider-
able, in the midst of that incontestable
evidence by which it is furpported. If,
then, .the futur~e slate of manl be not
placed in so full and clear a light as we
desir-e, this is no more than what the ana-
10gy of all religion, both natural and re-
vealed, gave us reason to expedt.

But fuzch a solution of the di~fficulty will'

be thought imperfedr. It may, perhaps,
nlot give much fatisfadion, to show that
all religion ab5ounds with diffticulties of
a like natu~re. Our situation, it will be
f'aid, is s~o much the more to be Jamented,
that. not: on one fide only we are confined
in our enlquiries, -but on all hands envi-
uvoned with rnyfterous obfcurity~.--Letpus

then,

then, if so much diffatisfied with our con- SE R M
dition, give scope for once to Fancy, sand V
~confider -how the plan of 1Provid~ence might:
be redified to our wish. Let us. call upon
the Sceptickr, and desire him to fay, what
meas~ure of informat~ion would afford liim
entire fatisfacdion,

This, he will tell us, irequires riot any

long or deep deliberation. He desires on-
ly to have his viewv enlarged beyond the
limits of this corporeal Rtate. Instead of
resting upon evidence which requires difa
cufr~on, which Inuft be supported by
much reasoning, and which, after all, he
alledges yields very imperfed inform-
ation, he demands the everlasting man
fions to be so displayed, if in truth s~uch
mansions there be, as to place faith on a
level with the evidence of sens~e. What
noble and happy effe~s, he exclaims,
would instantly follow, ·if man thus be-
held his present and his future existence at
once before him ! He would then become

Even the pres~ervation of life would be

which were dis~played to his fight, he
would sojourn on earth as a melancholy
exile. Whatever Providence has prepared
·for the entertainment of man, would be
viewed with contempt. Whatever is now
attractive in society, would appear insipid.
.In a word, he would be no longer a fit
inhabitant of this world, nor be qualified

flia, the fouls of good men .are. tried,
imlproved, and fitrengthened. In this
field, their honours are reaped. H~ere are
formed the capital virtues of fortitude,
semperanc~e, and felf-den ial;l moderation
in prosperity, patience in adversity, fab-·
mniliron to the will of God, and charity
and forgivennefs to men, amidst the vari-·
ous competitions of worlldly irrtereft.

Such is the plan of Divine wif~domr for

man's improvement. But put the cafie,.
that the, plan devised by human; wifdlomn
were to takse place, and that: the rewards
of the j~ust were to· be now fully dis~played,
to view ; the exercise of all those· graces
which I have mentioned,, would· be e~n-
tirely fuperfleded., Their very names would-
be unknown. Every temptation being;
withdrawn, every worldly attachment
being fabdued by· the overpowering -dif-
coveries of eternity, no trial of sincerity,
no diferiminati~on of charade~rs, twould re-

main;

snaiin; no opportunity would be afforded 8 ER M.
for those aaive exertions, which are the vl";
rmeans of purifying and perfe~ting the
gaood. 'On the competition between time
and eternity, depends the chief exrercife
of human virtue. The obic~urity· which
at present hangs over eternal objeats,
pres~erves the bompetition.~ Remove that
obs~curity, and you remove human virtue
from its place. You overthrow that whiole
fyfitem of discipline, by which imperfedt
creatures are, in this life, gradually train-
ed up for a more perfeA slate.

Wh~ere then do we land. at last, but. in

this conclusion, That the full display,
which was demanded, of the heavenly
glory, would be so far fronri improving
the human foul, that it would abolish
thos~e virtues and duties which are the
great infiruments of its improvement ? It
would be unsuitable to the charaa5er of
m~an in every view, either as an adtive
being, or a moral agent. It would dif-
qualify him for taking part in the affairs
of the world; for relishing the pleasu~res,

Nz 2or

siHR M. or for dikiharging the duties of li~fe; : h

Iv. a word, it would entirely defeat the pur-

pol'e of his being placed on this earth,.
And the question, W7hy the ~Almighty has
been pleased to leave a s~piritual wRorld,.
and the ~fu~ture existence of man, under
so mnuch obfcrurity, resolves in the end in-
to this, Why there thould be iAch a crea-
ture as man in the univerfie of~ God ?-
Such is the issue of thre improvements
proposed to be made on the plans of Pro-:
vidence. They adid to the difooveries of
the furperiour wmifdom of God~, and of the
pres~umption and folly of moan.

FRon what: has been said, it now ap-

pears, that no reasonable objedtion to the
belief of a future slate arises, friomu the:
imperfeft dis~coveries of it which we en-
joy ; from the difficulties that are mingled
with its evidence; froam our feeing· as
t~hrough .a glass darkly, and being left to-
*walk byfaith and not by jght. .It icannot
be. other wife, it ought not to be other-
wifE, in our pres~ent state. The evidencel

wphich

which is afforded, is f~ulicient for the 8 E·R IV
conviaiion of a candid mind, fufficient Iv.
for a rational ground of conduA ; though
not so firiking as to withdraw ouir atten-:
tion from the present: world, or altoge-
ther to overcome the impreflion of fenfi-
ble objeats. In s~uch evidence it becomes
us to acqjuiefce, without indulging either
doubts or complaints, on account of our
not receiving all the fartisfaaioan which-
we fondly desire, but which our present
immaturity of being excludes. For upon
the supposition of immortality, this life is
no other than the childhood of existence;
and the measures of oixr knowledge must
'be proportioned to s~uch a slate. To the
~fuccefT~ve stages of human life, from in--
fancy to old age, belong certain peculiar
attachments, certain cares, desires, and
interests; which open, not abruptly, but
bty gradual advances, on the min~d, as it
becomes fit to receive them, and is pre-
pared for :ading the part to which, in
their order, -they pertain. Hence, in the
edu~cation of. a child, no one thinks of in-

spiring

SER 1. spiring him all at once with the know-

IV* ledge, the fentimnents, and views of a

man, and with contempt for the exer-
cif~es and amusements of childhood. Orn
the contrary, employments s~uited to his
age are allowed to occupy him. .By there,
his powers are gradually unfolded; and
advantage is taken of his youthfurl plur-
furits, to improve and firengthen his
mind; till, flep by itep, h~e is led on to

\ ~higher prof~peats, and prepared for a larger

and more important s~cene of adtion.

This analogy, which so happily illu-

fkrates the pref~eat conduA of the Deity
towards man, des~erves attention the more,
as it: is the very illuffration us~ed by the
Apostle, when treating of this f~ubjeal in
the context. Now, says he, we know in
part--but when that which is perfed is
come, that wehich is in part JGall be done
rteawa. When I was a child, I Jpake as a
child, I underf Jiood as a child, I thought as a
child ; but when I became a mnan, I put
away childh things. For now we fee
:through a gla~sJ, dlarkly ; buct then, Jace to

face ;

fac~e: Nowza I know in part ; bu~t then, I SER M.
}Jhall knowu e~ven as I am knowun. Under **';
the care of the Ailmighty, our education
is now going on, fi-rom a mortal to an
immortal slate. As much light: is let in
upon us, as we can bear without injury.
When the obje<5s become too s~plendid
and dazzling for our fight, the curtain
is drawn. Exercised in s~uch a fi~eld of
adtion, as fa~its ~the firength of our un-
ripened powers, we are, at: the fame time,
by proper profCpeAs and hopes, prompted
to asp~ire towards the manhood: of our
nature, the time wehen child~4 things }hall
b7e pult awa~~y. But full, betwixt tho~se
future profpeats, and the impression of
pres~ent o~bjeats, furch an accurate propor-
tion is established, as on the one hand.
fhzall~ not produce a total contempt of
earthly things, while we aspire to those
that are heavenly ; and on the other,
thall not encourage such a degree of at-
tachment to our pres~ent slate, as would
render us unworthy of future advance-
ment, In a word, the whole courfie of

things

S ER M. things is tCo ordered, that we mnay neithMi

~t~v by an irregular and precipitate education,

·become men too foon;j nor by a, fond
and trifling induxlgence, be f~uffered to
continue children for evuer.

LEr. these refle~ionls not only remove~

the doubts which may aris~e from our~
o-bfCcue kn~owledge of immrortality, but
liknewife produce the highes~t atdmiration
of~ the wisdom of o~ur Creator. T7he ftruce

which he operates on the natural and

we are kept in fuxch ig~norance, with re-
sp~ed to the extent of his work~s, to the
nature and agency of spiritual beings.
and even with refp~ed to the union be-
.tween our own fbul and body : To all
ther~e, andt several other enquiries of the
fame kind, which often employ the soli-
citous res~earches of s~peculative men, the
anfwver is the fame that was given to the
interesting: question which makes the
f~ubjeA of our discourse. The degree of
knowledge' desired, ' would prove incom-
patible with the design, and with. the pro-
per business of this life.. It would rais~e us
to a sphere too exalted; would reveal ob-
Jieds too great and firiking for our pres~ent
faculties ; would excite feelings too firong
-for us to bear; in a wvord,. would unfit
us for thinking or· ading~ like human
creat~ures. It' is therefore reserved for a
more advanced period. of our nature;- and

the·

the hand~t of Infinite wifi~domr hath' in ~mer- s-E it M.IL

olverpower the fight of mortal~s.

thiat is, the concealment: under whicki

FROM the whole view' whicih we ~have

taken of thle fubeA, this importanlt in-

firuf~tiorn

Arudion aris~es, That the great design of s ER Ia
all the knowledge, and in .particular of IV·
the religious knowledge whida God. hath
afforded us, is, to fit ues for difchar ing
the duties of life. No ofelefS discoveries
are ma~de to is~ in religion~: No dis~coveries
even of useful truths, beyand the precise
degree .of information, which is f~ubfier-
vient to right condudt. To this great end
all our information points. In this center
all the lines of knowledge meet. Life andc
imamortality are brought to Aght inr th5ego/pel;
yet not so displayed as to gratify the cu-
riofity of the world with an affonifhing
fCpedacle;. but only so far made known,
as to assist and s~upport us in the pra~tice
of our duty. If the discovery were more
imperfeA, it would excite no defie of
immortality ; if it were more ~full and
firiking, it would render us carele~s· of
life. On the first s~upposition, no suss-
clent motive to ~virtue would appear; on
the s~econd, no proper trial of it would re-
main. In the one cafe, we should think
and aAl like men who have their portionr onaly

E ER M. onl~y in this wlorld; -in thfe other, safe likdej

aY kn~en who hatve no c~onceri wBi~th. thiS wrorld

at all. Whereas now, by~ the wife confiti
tution of H-eaven, we are placed ·in the
most favourable fituiation for ading, with
Spropriety, our -allotted part here; and for
rising, in due cours~e, to higher honour
and happinefrs hereafter.

Let us then second the [kind intentionzs

of Providence, and adt upon the plan
which it hath pointed out. Checkting
.our inqjifit~ive s~olicitude ab~out· what the'
;Almighty hath concealed, let us diligent-
ly improve what he hath maade known.
Inhabitants of the earth, we are at th;e
fiamne time candidatels for heavren. L~ook-
ing upon thes~e as on-ly di~ffterent vtiews of
one consistent charader, let us carry on
our preparation for heaven, not by ab-
firading ours~elves from the concer~ns of
this world, but bys fulfilling the duties
and ofi~ces of every flation ·in life., L iving
sob~erly, righteoucjly3, and gody in the present
zeoorld, let us look for that blefed hope,; and
:the glorio~us appeariang of the great God, and
OurP Snaiour JeSfus Chrifl.

s ]Befor

Before Ii conclude, it Tnay be proper to ·b'EiltM~.

ebl~erve, That the reasonings in this dit J**~
cours~e give no ground to apprehend any
danger of our being too much influenced
by the blelief of a futu~re tat~e. I have
thown the hurtf~l1 effeats which wo~uldt
follow from two bright and full a dis~co-
very of the glory of that slate~; and in
ihowing this, I have juffified the .decree
of Providence, which permits no such
<Lifcovery. But .as our nature is at prez
4'ent' confitumted, attached by io many
firong· conne~tions to the world of ~sease,
and enjoying a communication so feeble
and distant with the world of spirits, we
nieed fear no danger from cultivating in-
tercourf~e with the latter as much as posT-
fi~ble. On the contrary, from that inter-
cours~e the chief security of our virtue is to
be fought. The blafs of our nature leans
so much towards s~ense, that from thiis fide
the peril is to be dreaded, and on this fide
the defence is to be provided.
.Let us then *walk by faith. Let us
firengthen this principle of a~tion to the

P uatmoft

IER M. utmost of our power. Let us implore

yfv~lithe Divine grace, to firengthen it with-

in us more and more : That w~e may
thence derive an antidote against that
s~ubtile poison, wvhich inceffagnt commerce
with the objeas of f'enfe: diffufe~s through
our fouls ; that we may t~henc~e acquire
purity and dignity of manners, faited to
:our divine hopes; and, undefiled by the
p~leas~ures of the world, upihaken by its
terrours, may pres~erve to the end one con4·
ftant tenour of integrity. Till at last, have
ing, under the conduat of~hriftian faith,
happily finifhned the period of discipline,
~we enter on that Rtate, where a far nobler
scene shall open; where eternal objeats
~Ihall ihine in their native fCplendo-r ;
where, this twilighit of mortal life being

had spent the evening in conference with
his difrciples; like a dying; father in the

nate the labours of his imrport3ant life, by
·a death fliRi more important and1 illuffri-
o us *; the hour of atoning, by hi3s Enifiter-

of ·accompif~h·ing~ pro~phecies, types; a~nd
-4ymrbols6 which had bee· ·carried pa

throug~h a series of ·ages ; the hour of con- 8 ER M
cluding the old, andr of introd~ucing to the 'r.
worc~ld ·the new dif~pefaition of relig~ion;
the hour of his triumphi~ng over the
world, and deat~h, and he3 4 the hour of
his credting that spiritual kingdom which
is to last for ever. Such i's the hour, fach
are the events, which you are to commne-
morate in the Sacramnent of ouzr Lord-~'s
Supper. I thatll attempt to set themr be-

the ability of man.

Li TarTs was the hour- in which, Chriift

was glorified by his f~ufferinags. The
whole of his life Ihad discovered much31
real greatness under a mean appearance.
Through the cloud of his humiliation,
his native ·luffre often ~brok~e forth s but
niev~er did it- hine o ~bri~ght as in this latt;,
this trying hour. Itwas indeed the h·our
ofiffrefss and of blood. ·He krnew itE tco
be Eac~h; an~d w ~n: h~e ·rtrter1ed the words·

·of

8'E R M. of the Text, he; had before his eyes, thea

V· executioner and the cross, thre' fcourgey

the nails, and the s~pear. But by profjeats
of this nature his foul was not to be over~
come. It is distress which ennobles everyt
great charadter; and difirer~s was to glo-L
rify the Son of God. He was now tti
teach all mankind, by his example, howrJ
to fCuffer and to die. 3He was to fl~and.
Lforth before his enemies as the faithful
'Witnef~s of the trIuth ;jus ify~ing by his
behaviour the charader which he affumn
ed, and sealing with his blood the doc~
trine which he taught.

What magnanimity in all his words

and adtions on this great occasion ! The
court of Herod, the judgment-hall of
Pilate, the hill of Calvary, were to many
theatres prepared' fEor his difiplaying all
the virtues of a constant and patient mind.
W~hen led forth to thuffi-r, the fi~rst voice
wrhich we hear from him, is a generous
lamnentation over the fate of his unfortu
narte, though guilty, country;· and, to the
last moment of his life, we behold him ·in

lent spirit. No upbjraiding, no complain- "*
ing exprefi~on eieaped from his lips, dutr-
ing the long and painful approaches of a
cruel dleath. He betrayed no fygmptom
of a weak or a vulgar,: of a difcompofred
.or impatient mind. With the ultmoft at-
tention of filial tenderness, he committed
his aged mother to the care of his beloved
dis~ciple ". With all the dignity .of a So-
vereign, he conferred pardon on a peni-
.tent: fellow~-ifuferer. .With a greatnefCs of
mind beyond example, he spent his last
moments in apologied and prayers, for
those who were shedding his blood.

By wonders in heaven, and wonders

on earth, was this hour distinguished.,
All nature seemed to feel it; and the dead
and the living bore witnes~s to its import-
ance. The veil of the temple was rent int
twzain. The earth ihooki. There was
darknes~s over all the land. The graves
were opened, and m9zany wuho slept aroft
.and woent intco the Holy City. Nor were ther~e
the only prodigies .of this awful hour.

The dark,- and s~eemingl~y ambiguous

met~hod of Conveying important difco~ve-

peculiar to the sacred books. The ~Sirit
of .God, in ~pre-figni~fying· t~he death of
Christ, adopted that plan, according to
which the whol~e knowledge ofr t~hof
earlyT ages was propagated through the
piorld. U~nder the vieil of mysterious al-
'inflon, all wiidom was then concealed.
From the fenfibe world, images wesref

]legories, ·the Philos~opher infi~ruited his
disciples ;. even -the Legiflatorl, by -figu-
rative sayings, commanded the reverence
of he people. :Agreeaibly~to thiis prevail-

~t~upenfa~tion of the Old Testament was Ed

cihaduCted, as td be ~thie' Thadorc aind thie

This was the hour of affociatcion and

tunion to all thle worfhippaers of God.
When Christ s~aid, It is fm/hed, he threw
down the wall of p~artition w~hich had so
long dividfed the- Gentile from th~e Jew.
He gathered into one, all the faithfill,
out of every kindred and people. He
proclaimed the hour to be come, w~hen

'r-; no longer' confined to one nation, nor his

worship to one tem~ple; but over all the
earth, the worshippers of the Father
should Jfreve hims in /pirit and in truth.
·From that hour, they who dwelt in: the
ut~termof endrs of the earth, frangers to the
covenant o~f promrfe, began to be brougiht
nigh. In that hour, the light of the
Gospel dawned from afar on the British
islands.

Duaring a long cours~e of ages, Provi-

dlence fecemed to be occupied in prepar-
ing the world for this revolution. The
whole~ Jewith cecono~my wa~s intended to
usher it in. The knowledge of God, was
preserved unextinguifhed in one corner
of the wor~ld, that thence, in due time,
mig~ht iflhie- forth thle lightn which was to
. oversp~read the earth. Suc~cessive revela-

beyond the narrow bounds of Judaea, to

still carrying on a progrefl~ve plan, which
Iwas a~ccompliibed at t~he deat~h of Christ.

Not only in the territories ·of Israel, but

away : H-e was beheld to fall zike Agh~tn2ity

statue of every fals~e God tottered on its

As

SER M. As on the cross Christ triumphed over

'r* Satan, so he overcame his auxiliary, the

b /Y 1. world. Long had it 'affa~iled him with

'its temptations and dif~couragemaents. In
this hour of s~evere trial, he su~rmounted
them all. Formerly he had der~pifed the
pleath~res of the world. He now baffle
its terrours. Hence he is juffly f'aid to
have crulcifed the wPOrld. By his f~uffer-
ings, he ennobled diffrefs.; and he dark-
ened the Iluffre of the pomp and vanities
of- life. H-e dlifcovered to -his 'followvers
the path which leads, through affliation,

Death also, the. last fee of man, was

the vid~im of this hour. The formidable
appearance of the fpeatre reniained ; but
his dart was taken away. For, in thet
hour when Christ expiated guilt, he dif-
armed death, by securing the refitrredtion

of

of the just. When he said to his peni- st ItM.

his followers the certainty of heavenly

difhniffed, anid thet fi~laming sword to be
theathed, which had beeh appointed at
the fall, to kieep frompt man the *wayn3 of th5e
Tree of Life . Faint, before this period,
had been the hope, indiftinat the profpeat,
which even good men enjoyed of the
heavenly kingdom. Life and~ immortality
were now brought to light. From the hill
of Calvary, the first clear and certairi
view was given to the world of the ever-
lasting mansions. Since that hour, they
have been the perpetual consolation of
believers in Christ. Under trouble, they
s~ooth their minds ; amidst temptation,
they support their virtue; and, in their
dying mloments, enable them to fay, O3
Dealth! where is thy Jifing·? O Grave !
where is thy uill~ory?

I ER M. VI. Tuzs was the hour when our Lord

LI*; ereded that spiritual kingdom w~hich is

never to end. How vain are the counsels.
and desi~gns of men ! How thallow is the
policy of the wicked ! How short their
triumphingr ! The enemies of Christ ima-
gined, that in this hour they had s~ucces~s-
fully accomnplifhed their plan for his de-
firudion. They believed, that they had
entirely feattered the Gmall party of his
followers, and had extinguished his name
and his honour for ever. In derision,
they addressed him as a King. They
cloathed him with purple robes ; they
crowt-ned him with a crown of thorns ;
they put a reed into his hand ; and, with
infiult~ing mockery, bowed the knee before
himh. Blind and impious men ! How
little did they know, that the Almighty
wvas at that moament setting hima as a Kiiag·
on the hill of Sion; gi~ving him the Heathen
for· his inheritance, and the utter-mof part~t
of the earth for his pofefon ! How little
did they know, that their badges of
mock royalty were at that moment con-
' 2 v~erted~

verted into the signals of abro!u~te domi- SERa M.
nion, and the infiruments of irrefiftable -`t·
power ! The reed which they put into
his hands, became a red of iron, with
which he was to br-eak in pieces his enze-
mies; a f~eeptre, with which he was to
ruzle the universe in rig;hteousn~ess. The
cros~s, which they thought was to fligma-
tize him with infamy, became the 2ensign
of his renown. Inficad of being the
reproach of his followers, it was to be
their boast and their glory. The cross;
was to thine on palaces and churches,
throughout the earth. It was to be as-
fiumed as the diftindi~on of the most
powerful monarchs, and to wave in the
banner of viator~ious armies, when the
memory of Herod and Piiate should be
accursed; when Jerusalem should be re-
duced to ashes, and the Jews be vaga-
bonds over all the wmorld.

The~se were the triumphs which com-

menced at: this hour. Our Lord saw
them already in their birth; he fawe of
the travail of his foull, and wa~s fatisf~ed

# SERMON VI. On Gentleness. JAMES iii. 17. The wisdom that is from above, is  gentle 

On GEN T LE NE~S S

J AMES i 1. I

ThJe wif'~dom that is from above, is---gentle--

TO be wife in bur own eyes, to be SER M.

wife in the opinion of the world, '"*

and to be wife in the fight of God, are W
three th~ings to very. different, as rarely to
coincide. One mnay often be wife in hils
own eyes, who is far from being so in
the judgment of the world; and to be re-
puted a. prudent man by the world, is no
s~ecurity for being accounted wife by God.
As there is: a worldly happiness, which
~God perceives to be no other than dif
guised misery; as there are worldly ho-
nours, which in his eftirnation are re-

T proach ;

8 ERM. proach; fb there is a worldly wifdorr4

~V~Jwhich, in his fght, is fooylhneSJ. Of1 this

worl~dly wisdom the charadters are given
in the context, and placed in contrast with
thos~e of the wisdom wehich is from above.
The one is the wifrdom of the crafty ;
the other, that ouf the upright. The one
terminates in f~elfifhnefs; the other, in
charity. The one is full of frirfe and bit-
ter envyings ; the other, of mercy and of
good frucits. One of the chief chara~ers:
by which the wis~dom from above is dif~-
-tinguifhed, is g~entleneji, of which I am:
now to discourse. Of this t~here is the
greater occasion to dis~cours~e, becaufre it is
too s~eldom viewed in a religious light;:
and is more readily considered by the
bulk: of men, as a mere felicity of nature,,
or an exterior accomplis~hment, of man-·
ners, than. as a Christian virtue whicha
th~ey are bound to cultivate. I ihall first
explain the nature of this .virtue; and
shall then offer some arguments to re-
commend, and some dire~tions to fa~cili,-
tate,~ the prac~tice of it,

I BEGIN with distinguishing true gen- 8 ER M.

dlenefs from passive tameness of spirit, *
and from unlimited compliance with the
manners of others. That pafi~ve tame-
nes~s which fh~bmits, without struggle, to
every incroachment of the violent~and as~-
fuming, for~ms no part of Christian duty;
but, on the contrary, is defiruffive of
general happines~s and order. That unli-
mited complaifagnce, whlich, on every oc-
cation, falls in with the opinions and
manners of others, is to far from being a
virtue, that it is itself a vice, and the pa-
rent of many vices. It overthrows. all
fleadinefs of principle ; and produces that
sinful conformity with the world, which
taints the whole charaCter. In the pre-
sent corrupted fcate of human manners,
always to assent and to comply, is the
very worst maxim we can adopt. It is
impossible to support the purity and dig-
nity of Christian morals, without oppof-
ing the world on various occasions, even
though we . hould fland alone. That
g~entlenes~s therefore which belongs to vir-

1 2 tue,

8 ER M. tue, is to be carefully diftingupifhed -from

VI* the mean spirit- of cowards, and the fawn-·

ing assent of fyicophantis. It renounces
no juff: right from fear. It gives up no
important truth from flattery. It is in-
deed not only consistent with a firm
mind, but it necefrarily requires a manly
Epirit, and a fixed principle, in order to
give it any real value. Upon this solid
ground only, the polish of gentleness can
with advantage be f~uperinduced.

It ftandls opposed, not to the most de-

termined regard for virtue and truth, but
to harfihnefs and s~eve~ri~ty, to pride -and
arrogance, to violence and oppr-ession.
It is, properly, that part: of the great
virtue of charity, which makes us un-
willing to give pain to- any of our bre-~
thren. Compafflon prompts us to relieve
their wants. Forbearance prevents us
from retallatting their injuries, Meeknes~s
r~estrains our angry pafflons; candour, our
severe judgments. Gentleness corre~ts
whatever is offenfive in our manners;
and, by a. constant train of human ats

tentioznS

tentions, flu~dies to alleviate the burden .8 ER M
of common misery. Its office, therefore, I
is extensive. It: is not, like some other
virtues, called forth only on peculiar
emergencies; but it is continually in ac-
tion, when we are engaged in intiercourfe
w~ith men. It ought to form our addrers,
to regulate our s~peech, and to dilffufe it-
self over our whole behaviour.

I must warn you, however, not to

confdund this gentle zpwydom *which is from
abozle, with that artificial courtefyT, that
studied finoothnef~s of manners, which is
learned in the school of the world. Such~
accomplishments, the most frivolous and
empty may possess. Too often they are
employed by the artful, as a snare; too
often aff~eted by the hard and unfeel-
ing, as ·a cover to the bas~enes~s of their
minds. We cannot; at the f~ame time,
avoid observing the homage, which,
even in fixch instances, the world is con-
firained to pay to virtue. In order to
render society agreeable, it is found ne-
cef~kry to afirmse somewhat, that may at

least

·-SE RM. jeait carry its appearaknce. Virtue is the

VI* univerfala charm. Even its thadow is

courted, when the s~ubstance is wanting.
The imitation o~f its form has b~een re-
duced into an art; and, in the commerce
of life,, the first fludy of all who would
either gain the esteem, or win the hearts
of others, is to learn the speech,. and to
adopt the manners, of candour, gentle-
anefs, and: humanity. But that gentlenes~s
which is the chara~teriffick of a good
man, has, like every other virtue, its
feat in the heart : And, let me add, no-
Sthing except what flowvs from the heart,
can render even external manners truly
prleafing. For no aflhmed behaviour can
at all times hide the real charader. In
that unaffeded civility which springs
fr~om a gentle mind, there is a charmn in-
finitely more powerful, than in all the
fludied manners of the most~ finished

True gentlenes~s is founded on a s~ense

of what we owe to him who made us,
ad to the common nature of which we

allfkae.It arises froQm re~fle£t~ion on our SER M.·

own failinigs ·and wants; and from just **L
views of the condition, and the duty of
man. It is native feelin~g,, heig~htened and
improved by principle. It,,is the heart
which easily relents ; ,which feels for eve-
ry thing that is human; and is· backward
and low~ to infict the least w~ound. It: is
aAfable in its address, and mild in its de-
mneanour.; ever ready' to ob~lige, and will-
ing to be obliged by others ; breathing
habitual kindness towards friends, cour-
tefyr to firangers, long·-fuffering to ene-
xmies. It exercises authority with mode-
ration; administers reproof with tender-
neCs ; confers~ favours witha eas~e and, m1o-
defty. It is unassuming in opinrion, andl
tempalerate in zeal.. It contends not eager-
ly about tri~fles;· flow to contradid, and
filtl flow~er to blame ; but prompt to
allay dissention, and to restore peace. It:
neither intermeddles unnecessarily with
the affairs;, nor pries inqu~ificively into the
s~ecrets, of others. It delights above all
things to alleviate diffrefs, and, if it can-

not

8 ER M. not dry up the falling tear, to sooth at~

~Jv least the grieving heart. Weei a

not the power of being d~eful, it is never
burdensome. It seeks to pleafie, rather
than to thine and dazzle; and conceals
w(ith care that s~uperiority, either of ta-
lents, or of rank, which is oppressive to
those who are beneath it. In a word, it
is that spirit, and that tenour of manners,
wvhich the Gospel of Christ enjoins, when
it commatnds us to bear one anoth~ers bur-

- ~dens ; to rejoice with those who rejoice,

and to weep with those who weep ; to please
every one his neighbou~r for his good ; to -be
kind and tender-hearted ; to be pitiful and
courteous ; to support thje *w~eak, and to be
patient towrards all mzen.

Having now f~uffciently explainedl the

nature of this amiable virtuxe, I proceed
to recommend it to your pra £1ice.- Let

alto any single precept. You need only SER aM

Cpen th;e New Testament, to find this vir- .y
tue perpetually'- inculcated. Charity, or
love, is the capital figure ever pres~ented
to our view ; and gentleness, forbearanc~e,
and forgiveness, are the founds ever re-
curingI1 on our ear.,

So predominant, indeed, is this spirit

throughout the Christian dispensation,
tihat even the vices and corruptions of
men have not: been able altogether to
defeat its tendency. Though that difi-
penfation is far from having hitherto
produced its full effedt upon the world,
yet we can clearly trace its infhience, in
humanizing the manners of men. Re-
markable,, in this ref~pedt, is the vi~tory
which it has gained over those powers of
violence and cruelty, which belong to the
infernal k-ingdom. WViherever Chriftia-
nity prevails, it has dis~couraged, and, in
some degree, aboli~shed slavery. It has
rescued humnan natdre from that ignomi-
nious yoke, under which, in former ages,
Thye one half of mankind groaned. It has

U 2 introduced.

fexi~es, and rendered .the .conjogal union
more rational and. happyr.·- It has abated
the ferocioufneifs of war. It has mIti-
gated the rigour- of defipotifmn, mitigated
the cruelty of' punishments ; in a word,
has reduced mankind, from their antient
barbarity, into a more humane. and gentle
flate.~-D- o wve pretend re~fpedt and zeal
for this religion, and at the fiine- time:
allow ourselves in t~hat: harshness and ~fe-
verity, which are so contradia;ory to its
genius ? Toop plainly we show, that it has
no power over our hearts. We may rei·
tain the Chr~itian name; but we have
abandoned the Christian f~ipirit.

II. ConsinnR the relation which you

bear to· one another. Mlan, as a folita-
r-y individual, is a very wretched being.
A~s long as hae fl~ands detached from his
kind, he is poffeffed, neither of happiness,
nor of s~trength. WIe are formed by na-
ture to unite; we are im~pelled towards
each other, by the compassionate initinats

in our fr~ame;· wie are~ linked~ by- a thou- 8 ER M.·
sand~ connedionls founded on common '_V~
wants. Gentleness therefore, or, as it is
very properly termed, humatnity, is what
man, as such, in every Rtation, owes to
man. To be inaccelflible, contemptuous,
an~d hard of heart, is to revolt a~gainst
our owvn nature; is, iix the language of
scripture, to hide ourfeives ~fr.om ou~r own
ejhiJ;. A~ccordingly, as all feel the claim
which they have to mildnes~s and huma-
nity, so all are s~ensibly hurt by the want
of it in others. On no fide are we mnore
vulnerable. No complaint is more feel-
ingly made, than that of the har~hr and
rugged manners of p~ersons with whom
wve have intercours~e. But how feldomn
do we transfer the cafe to ourselves, or
examine how far we are guilty of in-
flifing on others, whose s~ensibility is the
the fame with ours, thos~e very wounds
of which we so loudly complain ?

But, perhaps, it will be pleaded by

some, That this gentlener~s, on which we
now insist, regards only those finaller

of~ices

& ER 14 offices of ·life, which in thneir eye are

** ~not effeatial to religion and goodness.

Negiigent~, they- confelfs, of the gover1-;
ment of their temper, or the regulation
of threir behaviour, on flight occasions;
they are attentive, as they pretend, to the
great duties of beneficence; and ready,
wh~enever the opportunity presents, to
perform important s~ervices to their fel-
low-creatures. But let s~uch persons re-
fled, that the occasions of performing
thos~e important good deeds, very rarely
occur. Perhaps their situation in life, or
the nature of their connedions, may in
a great: mea~sure exclude them from fiich
oppo0rtunities. Great events give scope
for great virtues ; but the main t-enour of
hnuman life, is coiinpofed of small occur-
rences. W5iithin the round of there, lie
the materials of the happiness of most:
men ; the f~ubjeats of their duty, and
the trials of their virtue . Virtue must
be formed and su~pported, not by unfre-
quent atas, b~ut b~y daily and repeated exl-
extions. In order to its becoming either

vigorous

eigorous~ at feful,· it muiut be habitually $ ER hi
adive; not: br~eaking forth acicalona:01i
wyith a transie~nt luffre, like the blaze of
the comret ; but regular in its returns,
like the lighit: of day : Not likEe ·the arou-
matick gale, wuhich sometimes feasts the
se~nse; but li~ke th2e ordinary breeze, which
purifies tehe- air, and renders it healthful.

Years may pass over our heads, with-

out affording any opportunity for ads
of high beneficence, or exthenfive utility.
Whereas not a day passes, but in the
common tranfa~tions of life, and efpe-
cially in the int~erourf~e of dometick
faciety, gentleness finds place for pro-~
moting the happines~s of others, and for
firengthening in ourselves the habit of
virtue. Nay, by fieafonable discoveries
of a humnane fipirit, we fometimres contri,-
bute more materially to the advancement
of happiness, than by adtious which are
s~eemingly more important. There ·are
situations, not a few, in human life,
where -the encouraging reception, the
condescending behaviour, and the look

SER M. of ijympathy, bring'grieater relief to theb

L~vfj heart, than the most bountifuil gift.

-While, 04 the other fide, when the hand
of liberality is extended to beffow, the
want of gentleness is filf~icient to frufi~
.trate 'the intenltion of the' benefi~t, WVe
four those whom we meant to oblige;
and, by conferring favours with often-
tatiion and harfhanefis, ~we convcert `themn
inTt~o injurires. Can any dis~position1 th~en
be held to pos~sess a lowP place in the itale
of virtue, whose influenzce. is s~o co~nfid~es
able on the ~happiness of t~he wcorld ?

Gentleness is, in truth,. the great ave-

nue to mutual enjoyment. A~midst t~he
firife of interferi-ng interest-s, it t~emper~s
the violence of contention, and keeps
alive the f~eeds of harmony. It softens
animnofities s. renews enderarments; and
renders the countenance of man, a re-
fr~efhment to man.· Banish gentlenef$
-from the earth; s~uppos~e the world to be
illed with none but harthn andt contient'iou-s
£pirits; and what fort of faciey would
`remain ? The foli~ftu-de o-f ithe desert werei

elemrent~s in chaos;i the cave, where fa~b- -f

representations of such atffembie~s o~f men.

SER M . duty, and of common happines~s, be in-

vt. th~Cfficient to recommend the virtue of

w~hich we treat, then let me desire you,

III. To c~onfidLer yo~ur own interest.

WMhatever ends a good man can be s~up-
pos~ed to pursue,, gentlenes~s wi~ll be found
to favour them. It prepoiFeffes· and winls
every h~eart-. It persuades, when every
other argumrent fails ; often disarms the
fierce, and m~elts the flubborn. Where-
as harshness confirms the oppefition It
would s~ubdu~e; and, of an indifferent
person, creates. an enemy., He who could
overlook an injury committed in the col-
lifion. of interests, will long and severely
reseat the flights· of a· contemptu~ous be-
haviour.--rTo the man of gentlenes~s,
the world is generally: dis~pos~ed to afecribe
every other good quaality. The· hig~her
endowments of the m~ind wve admnire at:
a difiance; and when any impropriety
of behaviour accompanies them, we ad-
mire without love. They are like some
of the difiant stars,. whos~e beneficial in-

fluence

:fluenlce reaches not to us. Whereas, of 8 ER M.
the influence of gentlenes~s, all in some ~
degree partakre, and therefore all love it,
The man of this charad5er, rises in the
world without firuggle, and ~flourishes
without envy. Hlis misfortunes are uni-
verfa~lly lamented ; and his failings are
easily forgiven.

Bult wvhatever- may be the effe& of this

virtue on our externl' condition, its in-
fluence on our internal enjoyment is cer-
tain andi powverful. · Thbat inward tran-
quillity which it: promotes, is the first.
requisite to every pleasu~rable feeling. It
·is the calm and clear atmo~phrere the fCe-
rerlity and fuln-~fh-ine of th-e mind. When
benignity and gentlenes~s reign w~ithin,
wve are always least in hazard of being
ruffled from without; every person, and
~every occurrence, are beheld in the most~
favourable light. But let fomte clouds
of disgust and ill-humour gather on
;the mind; and immediately the s~cene
changes; N~ature seems transformed; and
the ap~pearance of all things is blackened

X; 2 toc

& ER M. to our view. - The gentle mind is like

~c~vthe fmnooth fiream, which reflea~s every

objeA in its just proportion, and in its
fairest coloursa. The violent fplirit, like
troubled waters, rendqrs back the images
of things difforced and broken; and com-
municates to them all, thapt diso-rd~ered
motion wh~ich aris~es~ solely from its own
agirtation.

Oftences muff come. As soon may the

wav-es of the sea cease to roll, as provo-
cations t~o aris~e from human corrirption
and frailty. Attacked by grleat- injuries,
the man of mild and gentle spirit will
~feel wh~at human nature feels; and will
diefend and resent, as his diuty allowrs him.

urt: to those flight provocations, and fri-
volous offences, which are the most fre-
qurent causes of disquiet, he is happily
~fuperiour. H~lence his days flow in a far
mo~re placid! tenour than thos~e of others ;
exemopted fr~om thle numb'erlefs difon-.
polires, which agitalte vulgar minds. In-
ipired with high~er sentiments; taught to
rega~rd, with inldulgente eye, the frailties of

men,

rnen, the omnifions of the careless, the fol- ER Mh.
lies of the imprudient, and the levity of T
the fickle, he retreats into the calmness of
his spirit-, as into an undiflurbed -fananu-
ary; and q~uietly allows the us~ual current
of life to hold its course.

This virtue has another, and still more

impol3rtant: connedion, with our interest,
by means of that relation which our pre-
s~ent: behaviour bears to our eternal slate.
H~eaven is the region of gentlenef's and
friendship; Hell, of fierceness~ and animo-
fity. If then, as the scripture infiruAs us,
according· to w~hat we now fSowr, we m~uf
hereaffter r-eap ; t follows, that the cultiva-
tion of a gentle temper is necessary to pre-
pare: us for heavenly felicity ; and that
the indulgrence of harsh dif~poitions, is
the intr~oduaion to future misery. Men, I
am afraiid, too often separate those articles
of their belief which relate to et-ernity,
from the ordinary affairs of the world.
They connec't them with the seasons of
seriousnes~s and gravity. They leave them
with much refpedB, as in a high region,

8 EaRM- to which, only on great occasions, they

**~ resort ; and, when they descend into

common li~fe, confider themselves as at
lib~erty to give free s~cope to their humoursr
and passions. Whereas, in fa&t, it is their
behaviour in the daily train of social ina-
tercourfie, which, more than any other
caufie, fixes and determines their s~piritual.
charader; gradually inflilling thofre dif~i-
positions, and forming thos~e habits, which
affed their everlasting condition. W-~ithr
r-egard to trifles, perhaps, their malig-
nant dispositions m7ay chiefly be indulged.
Btut let them rem~ember well, that thlofe
trifles, by increasing the growth of pee-
vifhnef~s and pafflon, become pregnant
with the most serious mif~chiefs ; and.
may fit them, before they are aware, for
being the future companions of none but
infernal piriits.

I mean not to fay, that in order to ou~r

preparation for Heaven, it is enough to
be mild and gentle; or that this virtue
alone, will cover all our fins. Through
the felicity of natural conflitution, a cer-

tailt

tain degree of this benignity may be perf- 8· E-R M.
feffied by some, whose hearts are in other Vr-
refpeAs corrupt, and- their lives irregular.
B~ut what I mean to a~ssert, is, That where
no attention i~s given to the government
of temper, meetnefs for Hleaven is not
yet acquired, and the regenerating power
of religion is as yet unknowna. One of
the first works of the Spirit of God, is,
to inflife into every heart which it inha-
bits, that gentle w~adom wzhich is from
abovue. They weh~o are Ch~rff's, havle cru~ci-
fSed the fE~JI7 With its afettions andl Ilufs;
but let it not be forgotten, that among
the works of the Jte/, hatredl, variance,
emlulaftons, ranth, fi~rife, and envyh~zgs, are
as expressly enumerated, as unzcleantne~ji,
mrurdekrs, drunkenzneft, and revellinzg *. They
w~ho continue. either in thre on~e ol- the
other, }hall not inherit, indeed can not
inherit, the king-dom of GodZ.

H-aving thus shown the importance of

g~entlenes~s, both as a moral virtue, and as
a Christian grace, I shall conclude the
fubjeat, with briefly su~ggesting some con-

Iiderationsa

*f Gal. v. I9, 20, 2 x.

8 ER M. fiderations which may be of us~e to f~acil~i

*ls tate the pradice of it.

Fox this end, let me advis~e you to view

your charadter ·with an impartial eye;
and to learn, from your own failings, to
give that indulgence which in your turn
you claim. It is pride which fills the world
with so much harfhlnefs and s~everity. In
the fulness of f~elf-eftimation, we forget
what we are. We claim attentions, to
which we are not entitled. W~e are rigo-
rous t.o -ofences, as if we had never of-
fended ; unfeeling to dif frefs, as if we
knew not wvhat it ·was to fuffer. From
those airy regions of pride and folly, let
us desc~end to our proper level. Let us
survey the natural equality on which Proi
vidence has placed man with man, and
refied~ on the infirm-ities common to all.
If the refleaion on nratulral equality and
mutual offences be inifuficient to prompt
humanity, let us at least r-emembe-r what
we are in the fight of God. Have we
none of that fbrbearance to g~ive to one

I another-,

another, which we all so earnestly int~reat e ER M.
from Heaven ? Can we look for clemency vI·
or gentleness from our Judge, when we C(
are t~o backw~ard to show it to our 'own
bret~hren ?

Accuitom yourselves, also, to ref left on

the small moment of thos~e things which
are the usual incentives to violence andi
contention. In th~e ruf~ed and angry
hour, we view every appearance through
a falfemedium. The mpft in.onfiderable
point of interest, or" honour, fwvells into a
momenttous ·object; and the slightest at-
tack seems to thre~aten immedaiatte ruin.
But after pafflon or pride has s~ubsided, we
look round in vain for the mighty mif-
chiefs wye dreaded. The fabrick, which
our diflurbed imagination had reared,
terlly disapp~ears. But though the caus~e
of contention has dwindled away, its
confiequzences remain. We have alienated
Ss iendri we - ave embiittereedan enemy ;
we have sown the feeds of future f~uipi-
clon, malevolence,. or difguft.-Sufpend
your violence, I bes~eech you, for a mo-

Y ment,

SE R M. ment, when caus~es of discord occur. An-

Stici ate that period of coolness, which, of

its~elf, will focon arrive. Allow yours~elves
to thlink, howv little you have any prof~pedl
of gaining by fierce contention ; but how
much of the true h~appines~s of life you
are certain of throwing away. Easily,
and from the iEmalleit chink, the bitter
waters of fir~ife are let: forth; but their
courf~de cannot. be fobref~een; and he f~eldoma
fails of fufFeringr Inot from their poison-
ous effet, who first allowed thern to
flow.

But gentleness will, most. o-f all, be' pro-

rnoted by frequent views of thos~e great
obsjeats w~hich our holy religion pres~ents.
Let the profpefts of imnrmortality fill your
yninds, Lsook upon this world as a slate
of passage. Co~nfider yourfeilves as eq,
gaged in the pursuit of higher interests;
as adting. now, u~nder the eye of God, an
introdudor~y part to a more important
feene. Elevated by sauch sentiments, your
minds will: become Ccalm and sedate. You
will look dlown, as from a fixperiour fla-+

tion,

tiori, on the petty diflurbances of the SER M.
W~orld. They are the f~elfifh, the sensual, vT-
and the vain, who are most fubhjec? to the
impotende of paffl~on. They are linked
fob closely to the world; by to many fidces
they touch every objeA, and ever~y per-
son around them, that they are perpCetu-l
ally huirt, anld perp~etually hurrtin~g others.
But the fipirit of tr-ue religion removes
us to a proper difiance fr-oml the g-rating
~objets' of wtorldly contention. It leaves
us f~ufficiently connedted with the wvorldl,
for adting our part in it with propriety ;
but disengages uis fr-om it s~o far, as
to weaken its power of difliurbingo our
tranquillity. It ins~pires magnanimity ;
and magnanimity: always brea~t~hs gentle-
ness. It leadls us to viewv the follies of
men with pity, not with rancouLr; and
to treat, with the mildnes~s of a fuperiour
nature, what in little muinds would ca'll
forth all the bitternef~is of pafiron.

Aided by fac~h considerations, let us

cultivate that gentle wisdom which is, in
to many refpea~s; important both to our

Y 2 duty

SE 1 M. duty and~ our happiness. Let us afl~unte

vI. it as the ornament of every age, and of'

·rv1~J

every flation. Let it ~temper the petu-
Jance of youth, and s~often the morose-
ness of old age. XLet itmitigate a~utho~rit~y
in thos~e who rule, and promnote deference~
among thofle who obey. I conclude with
repeating the caution, not to mistake for
true gentleness, that flimzy imitation of
it, called polished manners, which oft~en,
among the men of the world, under a
~smooth appearance conceals much af~pe-
rity. Let yours be native gentleness of
heart, flowing from the love of God, and
the love o~f m~an. Unite this amiab~le
spirit, with a proper zeal for all ~that is
right, and just, and true. Let piety be
combined in your charadter with huma-
nity. Let determined integrity dwell in
a mild and gentle breast. A charader
thus fuipported, wTill commland more real
refpeag, thran can: be procured by t~he mroft
thining accomplishments, when s~eparated
friom v~irtue.

etb all ·this availeth m~e not-hing, so long

KI~ing's gate.

T TESE are the words of one, who, SE R 1V

t'hough high in Rtation and power, vul.

confe ~ed' himself to be mis~erable. They ~
relate to a memorable occiur~rence in the
Persian history, under the reign ofAha-
f~uerus, who1 is fuappof~ed to be the Prince
known amnong Greek historians by the
naxme of Art~axerx~es. Ahas~uerus had ad-
vanced to the chief dignity in his kin~g-
dom Haman an Amalekite, who inhe-
rited all the ancient enmity of his race to

the

SER M. the Jewish nation. Hle appears, froiMi

vu.· whait id recorded of him, to hate been a

very wicked miniffer. Rais~ed to greatnes~s
without merit, he emnployed his powe'r
solely for the gratification of his passions.
As the honours which he poffeffed were;
next to royal, his pridepwas every day fed
with that: servile homage which is pecu-
liar to Afiatick courts; and all the ser-
·vants of the' King pr-offrated themfelvts
before him. In the midst of this general
adujlation, one person only flooped not. to
Haman. This was Mordecai the Jew;
w~ho, knowing this Amalekite to be an
enemy to t'he people of God, and2, w'ith~
virtuous indignation, defpifiing that: in-
folence of prosperity with which he saw
him lifted up, bowoedE not, nor did hima re
zlerence. Oin this appearance of~ difre-
fpee? from M~or-decai, Haman wrcas full of
wramth : Bult he thoucght coirn to lay handir
on Mlordcai alone. Personal revenge was
nlot f~ufficient td satisfy him. So violent
and! black were his paffilons,, that he re-·
so~lved to exterminate th~e whole nation to

which

which Mordecai belonged.' Abusing, fbr SER 1V.
this cruel purpo~se, the favour of his~crei vII-
dulous Sovereign, he obtained 'a decre'e to
be sent forth, that, against a certain day;,
all the Jews throughout the Persian do-
minions should be put to the fivord.
Mlean while, .confident of fulccefs, and
blind to approaching ruin, he continued.
exulting in his pros~perity. Invited by
Ahas~uerus to a. royal banqluet, which
Esther the Qgeen had prepared, hbe weent:
forth that day joyfrd and with a glad heart.
But behold how flight an incident was
f~uffcient to poison his joy ! As he went:
forth, he saw Mordecai in the King's
gate; and observed, that still he r-efus~ed
to clo him homage : He f1ood not up, nor
*wans maoved for hi'm ; although he well
knew the formidable designs which Ha-
m~an was preparing to execute. One pris
vate man, who depified his greatnes~s,
and difdiained fibubifllon, while a whole
Iringdom trembled before hrim; one Epi-
rit, which the utmost firetch of his powter
could neither fubduye nor humble, blast-

at itM. ed 14s triumphs. HFis whole foul was

VIT- ihaken with a floom of pafflon. Wrath,

pride,- and desire of reverige, rose into
fixry.· WUith difficulty he reitrained him-
self in publick ; but as soon as lie came
to- his. own houfie, he was forced to difn
close the agony of his mind. He gather-
ed together his friends and family, with
Zerifh his wife. He toldt them of the gloryv
of his riches, andtfb the ltitude of his chil-
d~ren, and all the thJings wherein the ~King
hacd promoated him~, anld how he h~ad ad-
wvanced him above the princes and servants
of the Kinzg. He said, mor·eo~ver, Yea, ~E/1her
the Zzueen did let no man comse i'n with the
KCing, unto the balnquet that }h5e had pre-
pared, but my~elf ; and to-mor.o~w also am I
i'nvited ulnto her with the K~ing. After all
this preamble, what is the conclusion ?--
Yet all this avanileth me nZOthing, so long
as I fee Mlordcai ~the few fi~tting at the
Ki'ng's gate.

The feqluel of Haman's hiffor-y I h~all

not now purfure. It mi~ght afford matter
for much infirudb~ion, by the confpicu-

2 ousi

twent. But, contemplating~ only the fin- ';
gular ficu~ation in which the Test preferits
him, anid the violent: agitation .of his
mind which it dif~plapys, the following
refleions naturally a~rise, which, toge-
t~her wlith some pradical improvem~ents,
shall make the faubjer8 of this difecourfe.
I[. WHow miferarble is vice, ~when one guilty
passion creates so much tormeint! II. Hows
iunavailing is prosperity, when, in the
height of it, a single dis~appointment can
;destroy the relish. of all it~s pleas~ures ! III.
How wyeak~ is human nature, which, in
the absence of real, is ·thus pr~one to form
to itself imaginary woes ?

I. INort mis~erable is vice, whern one

gulilty pafflon is capable of creating so
much to~rient ! When wbv discourse to
you of the' internal misery of fianers i
wvhen we represent the pangs which they
fu~ffer, from riolent pafflons, and a cor-
rupted I eart; we are sometimes fuf'pedted
of chidig a thgenefor dec~lamation, and

Z of

S'ER M. of heightening the pidture which wle

vn.· draw, by colours borrowed from fancy.

They whos~e minds are, by nature, hap-
pily~ tranquil, or whos~e situation in life
removes them from, the diflturbance and
tumult of pafiron, can hardlly conceive,
that, as long as the body is at eafet,
and the external condition prosperous,
anly thing which pass~es within the mind
thould cause s~uch exquisite woe. But,
for the truth of our assertions, we appeal
to the hiffory of mank~ind. WTe might
reason from the conflitution of the rati-
onal: fr~ame; where the underflan-ding is
appointed to be s~uprem~e, and the pafirons
to be s~ubord~inate ; and where, if this due
arrangement of its parts be overthrown,
misery as necessarily ens~ues, as pain is
c~onfequient in the animal ~frame, uapon -
the diflort-ion of its members. But lay-
ing s~peculations of this kind aside, it is
f~ufficient to lead you to the view of fadts,
the import of which can neither be con-
troverted, nor ·mistaken. This is, indeed,
t~he great advantage of hiftery, that it is

a mirrour which holds up mankind. to SER M.
their own view. For, in all ages, h~umanz vn.
nature has been ·the fame. In t~he circle
of worldly affairs, the fagme charafters
and situations are perpetually returning ;
and in the follies and pati3ons, the vices
and crimes, of the generations that are
past, we read those of the present.

Attend, then, to the instance now be-

fore us ; and conceive, if you can, a per-
son more thoroughly wretched, than one
redu~cedt to make this humiliating confef`-
sion, that: though s~urrounded with power,
opulence and plea~sure, he was loft to all
happiness;, through the fiercenes~s of his
resentment; and was at that moment:
stung by disappointment, and torn by
rage, ~beyond what he could bear. All
this availeth me nothing, So long- as I fee
1Mordec~ai the Jew ftting- at the K~ing-'s ~ate.
'Had this been a soliloquy of Hamnan's
within himfielf, it would have been a ifuffi-
cient dis~covery of his misery. But: whenz
we confider it as a conf~eflion which. he
makes to others, it is a proof that his

human nature in its firong hold, and cut
off its last resource. They penetrate to
the very feat of s~ensation; and convert
all the powers of thought into infiru-
mnents of torture.

Let us remark, in the event that: is now

before us, the awful hand of God ; and
admire his juffice, in thus making· the
finner's owen wic-kednze/s to repr-ove him, and
his backflzidZings to corred him. Scepticks
reason in vain against the reality of di-
vine government. It: is not a fubqjec' of
difaput~e. It - is a fad which carries the
evidence of sense, and dis~plays its~elf be-
fore our eyes. ·We fee the Almighty ma-
n~ifeftly purfu~zing th~~~s~er zer ith evuil. We
f~ee him connedting with every signal de-
viation from ~duty, thos~e wounds of the
fipirit which. occasion the most exquisite
torment. He hatlh not merely promul-
ga~ted his laws now, and delayed the dif-
tribution of rewards and punishments
runtil a future period of· being. But the

fanCaions

fanAions of his laws already take place; SE RM.
their effeats appear ; and with sauch infi- vn.I~
nite wisdom are they contrived, as~ to
require no other executioners of juffice
against the finner, than his own guilty
pafflons. God needs not come forth from
his-ficret place, in order to bring him to
punishment. He needs not call thunder
down from the heavens, nor raise any
minister of wrath from the abyfrs below.
~He needs only· fay, Ephraimz is joined to his
idols; let him alone : And, at that instant,
the finner becomes his own tormentor.
The infernal fire begins, of itfielf, to
kindle within him. The worm that never
dies, s~eizes on his heart.

Let us remark als~o, from this example,

how imperfe(5ly we can judge from ex-
ternal appearanlces, concerning real hap-
pinefs- or misery. All Persia, it is pre-
bable, envied Ham~an as the happiest
person in the empire; while yet, at the
moment of which we now treat, there
wcas not within- its bounds, one more
thoroughly wretched. We are seduced,

and

vu.' profpgrity fomietipigs throws a oud had

mepn. We are temnpted to inrljate theirg
crimoes, in ogde ·to partake~ f their ima-
g~ined felicity. But remember H9ams,·
pnd beware of the iThap-e. Think not,
when you behold a pageant of grandeur
dis~played to publick view, that you dif~
:ern the enlign of certain happinefq. in
prder to formT any jut .conclrrfion, you
must follow the grreat man into the Ce-
tired apa~7~rtm~ent,,where he lays afiie his
dit~uif~e. You myit not only be able to
penetrate- into the in~teriour· of famlsips
but you must have a faculty by which
y9ou can looks into the inside of hearts.
Were you endowed with falch a power,
you would most conunonly behold good
men, in proportion to; their goodg~efs,
satisfied and eaify; you would behold

per~fedt ease within himself, should view,
in the moss favourable light, the behavi-

owold.inldeed follow, if worldly pro~fperi-

human felicity. B3ut as it proffefes themr
not, the very' reverse of t~hose confequen-

Hence, the diiifrefped sh~own by Mordecai,

him. The cause lay not in the external

fuzggeft to us also, how often, besides cor-
rupting the mind, and eng~endering in-
ternal mis~ery, they lead us· to precipices,
and involve usr in ruin. At the moment:
when Fortune f~eemned to fmnile upon him,
with the most serene and fettled af~petat
she was digging in s~ecret the pit for his
fall. Prosperity was weaving aro~und, his·
head the web of defiruation-. Suc-ces~s in-
flamed his pride; pride increafred his thirft~i
of revenge; the revenge which, for the
fake of one manr, he fought to execute onm
a wmhole· nation, incen~e~d the Queen; and
hie is d~oomed to; fuffer the f~ame death
which he had prepared for Mordecai.--
Had Haman remained in a private ita-
tion, he might have~ arrived at a peaceable'
old age. He might: have been, I shall not
fay, a gotid or a happy marx, yet pro-
bably les~s guilty by far, and less wretch-
ed, than when pla~ced at the head of the

greatest

greatest empire in the East. -Who kno~eth & ER H

An extensive contemplation of humart

alffairs, will lead us_ to this conclusion,
That among the different conditions and
rankss of men, the balance of happiness
is pres~erved in a great meas~ure equal;
and that: the high and the low, the richi
and the poor, approach, in point of real.
enjoygment, mIuch nearer to each other,
than is commonly imagined. In the lot
of' man, mutual compenfati~onzs, both ofE
pleasure and of pain, universa8lly take
place. Providence never intended, that
any slate here should be either completely
happy, or entirely miserable. 'If the feel-
ings of pleas~ure are more numerous, and
more lively, in the hig;her departments
of life, su~ch also are those~ of pain. If
greatne~ss flatters our vanity, it mnult~ipies
our dangers. If opulence inacreafes our
gratifiatitons, it increases, in the. fame
proportion, our de~sires and demands. If

~those natural sa~tisfactions, which, after
all the refinements of art, are found to

much more attentive to preserve our vir-
tue, and to. impronnnve our minds, than to
gain the ·doubctfki and equivocal advani
tages of wor-ldly prosperity !--But now,
laying afiide the consideration of Haman's
great crimes; laying aside his high pro-
fperity ; viewing him~ simply as a man,
let us observe, from his hiffory,

from the intemperance of their passions,
are peculiarly expos~ed to them; yet the

florms of pffion· to which we are here
exzrpsfed, and the slippery patfhs which we

ful that a Heavenly Condudor' youchfa~fes
his' aid, let: us earnestly pray, that from
him may des~cend· divine light to guide
our iteps,.and divine firength to fortify
our minds. Let us pray, that his grace;
may keep us from all intemperate pas-,
flons, and mistaken purfulits of pleasure;
that whether it ihall be his will to give
or to deny us earthly pros~perity, he may
bless us with a.calm, a. found, and well-
regulated mind ; may give us moderation
in succes~s, and fortitude under dis~appoint-
ment; and may enable us, so to take
warning from the crimes and miseries
of others, as to escape the funares of guilt.

Beauty, wit, eloquence, and fame, are·
eagerly desired by persons in every rank
of life. They are the parent's fondest
wcifh for his child; the ambition of the
yoing;, and the admiration of the old.
And yet, in what numberles~s inflances
have they proved, to those wh~o poffreffed
them, no other than thining fnrares; fe-
duAions to vice, initigations to folly,
and, in the end, sources of misery ? Com-
fortably might their days have passed,
'had they been leiG cornfpicuous. But the
diftindious which brought them forth
to notice, conferred splendour, and with-
drew happinels. * Long life is, of all
others,, the most gener~al, and s~eemingly
the~moft innocent, objea of desire. With

Firit, We are not fuffciently ac quaint~

But, nex-t, s~upposing ·our knowrledge of

intended -by Provsidence to prom-iote.

1. Lrr this doi~rine teach us to pros

thro-ugh a world where e~vil so fr1equxent-
ly lurks under the form of good. To be
humble and modest in opinion, to be vi-
gilanzt and attentive in conduca, to diffruit
fair appearances,. and to reitlrain rash de-
fiEres, are~ infiruti ~n~s w~hic~h the dark!neifs
of our present slate fhlould firongily ·in-

Ee c~ulcate.

SER M.. culcate. God hath appointed our litue-L
vm.J ation to be so ambiguous, in order bothi

to call forth the exertioan~ of ·those intelli-
gent powers· which he hath given us, and
to enforce our dependence on his gracious
aid. It is not in man that wealketh, to d~irectl
h5is fleps. Surrounded with so many be-
wildering, paths, among which the wi~eit:
are ready to firay, how eartneiftly thould
we implore, and how thankfully should
we receive, that divine illumination wvhich
is promnifed in s~cripture to the pious and
the hlumble ! Th;e jecret of the Lord is with
t;hem that fear him. HYe wPill gui'de themr
weith his counzcl. HMe weill teach themen the
wa~y that ·they }~oubll ch3ufe. But what
must be the fate of him, whoi, amidfti all
the dlangrers attending . humran c~onduat,
neither looks up to H-eaven fo~r dire~ion,
nor properly exerts- that ereafon whnich
God hlath given him ? If to the most
diligent enq~uirer, it proves fb dlificult a
task~ to distinguish true good, fromi those
-fallacious appearances- with which it is
ever blended, how sh~ould he ditc~over it,

wmha

who b~rings neither patience nor attention SER M.
to the~ search; who applies to no other VITII
counsellor than prefeat pleafare, and,
with a rash and c~redulous mind, delivers
himflelf up to every s~uggestion of desire ?

Th~is admonition I particularly dire&t

to those, who are in a period of life too
often charadterized by f~orward pref~ump-
-tion, and headlong purs~uit. The s~elf-
conceit of the young, is the great source
of thofie dangers to which they are ex-
posed; and it is pec~uliarly unfort~unate,
that the age which flands most in need of
the counsel of the wife, should be the
most prone to contemn it. Confident: in
the opinions which they adopt, and in
the meas~ures which they purfiixe, they
s~eem as if they und~erfl~ood Solomon to
fay, not, Who knoweeth, buat, WCho is ig-
nrorant: of what is g~ood for mnz all th5e days

II. ]LET our ignorance of what is good

or evil, corredt anxiety about worldly fuzc-
cess. As rashnes~s is the vice of youth,
the opposite extreme of immoderate care
is th~e vice of advancing years. The doc-
trine which I have illuffrated, is equally
adapted ~for ch-ecking both. Since we are
to often betrayed into ev~il, by the 'mif-
taken purf'uit of good, care and attention
are requisite, both in forming our choice,
and in conduAing our pursuit; but since
our attention and care are liable to be to
often fruffrated, they should never be al-
lowed to deprive us of tranquillity.

The ignorance -in which we are left

concerning good and evil, is not su~ch as to
fuxperfede prudence in condua : For wtif-
dorn is still found to excel folly, as far as
dfh"t excelleth darkne/s. But it is that de-

gree

SER M gree of uncertainty, which ought to ren-
vill. der us temperate in purfuzit; which ought

to calm the~ pert~urb~ation of hope and
fear, and to cure the pain of anxiety.
Anxiety is th~e poison of h-uman life. It
is the pa"rent of mnany fins, and of mnore
miseries. In a world where every thing
is to doubtful; where you may succeed
in your with, and be mniferable; where'

penetrable to mortal eye ?--To provide
agrainft every apparent danger, byg the em-
ployment of the most~ promising means,
is the office of wisdom. But, at this point

point; by givingr yours~elves up to immo-

·dera~te concern about unknown event~s, SER M
you cdn do nothing to advance your fuc- VI *
cess, and you do much to ruin your
peace. You plant within your breast the
thorn which is long to gall you. To the
vanity of life, you add a vexation of
fSpirit, which is wholly of your owrn cre-
-ation, not of Divine appointment. For
the dubious goods of this world were rIe-
ver designed by God to rais~e s~uch eager
attachment. They were given to man for
his occallonal refreshment, not for his
chief felicity. By setting an excessive va-
lue upon objeats which were intended on-
ly for your s~econdary regard, you change
their nature. Seeking more fat~isfadion
·from them than they are able to afford,
you: receive les~s than they might give.
From a mistaken care to secure your hap-
-pinefs, you bring upon yourselves certain

evil, determine us to follow Providence,
and to resign our~selves to G od. One of

the

SER M. the moit important. lessons which can be
vin -given to man, iS resignation to his IMak~er 4

and nothing inculcates it more, than thLe
experience of his own inability to gcuide
himfelf.--You know not wihat is good fo-r
you, in the future periods of life. But
God perfe~tly ksnows it ; and if you f~aith-
fully serv~e him, you have reason to be-e
lieve that he wiall alwvays consult it. Be.-
fore him lies the whole: fuccef~ion of
events, which are to fill up your exiflence.
It is in his powler, to arrange and model
them at his pleafulre; and so to adapt one
thing to another, as to fulfil his promise
of making them all wreork togeth'er for g~ood
t~othofe w~ho love himz. Here then, ainidf 't
the agitattions of desire, and the perplexiY
ties of doubt, is one fixed point of reft;.
By this let -us abide ; and dfifinifs our
anxiety about: things uncertain and un-i
k~nown. Acquaint your/dlves weith God, and
be at peace. Secure the one thing· needfulll.
Study to acquire an interest ins the Divine
favour : And, you may Gfafely su~rrender

have some apology to offer. for deviating
-fromll the path of virtue. But the doc-
trine which I have illuffrated, deprives
him of all excuse, and places his folly.in
the most firiking light. He cl~imbs the
ftleep rock, and treads on the edge of a
precipice, in order to catch a shadow.
Hie has cause to dread,. not only the un-
certainty of the event which he wish~es to
accomplish, but: the nature also of that
event whien accomplished.· He is not only
liable to that dif~appointmnent of s~uccess,
which so often fruffrates all the designs of
men; but liable to a difagppoint~ment still
more cruel, that of being fixecefsful and
mifetrable at once. Riches and pleas~ures
are the chief temptations to criminal
deeds. Yet thos~e riches., when obtained,
may very poflibly overwhelm him~ with
unfbref~een miseries. T~hose pleasures may
cut short his- health and life.; And is it

-for fisch doub~tfill and fallacious rewards, S~ERM.
that the deceiverfills his moulth withi~es, vm.1
the friend betrays his bene~fadtor, th~e
apostate renounces his faith, and the at-
fafn; covers him~self with blood ?

Whoever commits a crime, incurs a

certain evil, for a most uncertain good.
WThat will turn to his advantage in the
cour~se of this life, he -cannot with any as-
fu~rance know. But this he may know,
with full certainty, that by break~ing the
Divine commandments, he will draw
upon- his head that displeas~ure of the
Almighty, which fhalll crush him for ever.
The advantages of this world, even when
innocently gained, are uncertain 'blefC-
finng~s when obtained by criminal means,
they carry a curse in their bosom. To
the virtuous, they are often no more than
chaff. To the guilty, they are always

and rashnes~s, and to enforce a diligent
exertion of our~ rational powers, joined
wiith a humble dependence on Divine aid.
It moderates eager paflions refpeding
worldly s~ucces~s. It inculcates refigna-

as fitnis the pres~ent: circumniances of man
better than more complete inforrmationa
concerning good and evil.

At the fagme time, the caus~es which

render this obscurity necessary, too plainly
indicate a broken and corrupted Rtate of
humnan nature. They show this life to be
a slate of: trial. They s~uggest the ideas of
a land of pilgrimage, not of the house of
reft. .Low minded and bjafie is he, who
asp~ires to no higher portion; who could
be satisfied to s~pend his whole existence,
in chafing those treacherous appearances
of good, which so often mck-his purs~uit.,
WIhat, thadow can be more vain than the
life of the. greatest part: of mnankind ? Of
all that eager and buffling crowd whiclx.
wre behold on the earth, how few discover
the path of true happiness ? How few can
we find, wvhof~e a~Stivity: has ·not been mifr-

employed,

~ not in confeffions of disappointment ? Is

this the slate, are there the habitations,
to which a1 rational spirit, with all its
high hopes, and great cap~acitiles, is to
be limited for ever ?-; Let uIs b'lefs that
God who hath sTe-t nobler pro~pieAs bei
fore us'; who, by the death and refurrrec-
tion of his Son Jes~us Christ, hath begotteni
us to the lively hope of aEn inheritan~ce in*~
corrulptible, un~defiled, and that fadeth not
aweayt, referzled int the heavents. Let us
sho~w ourselves worthy of such a hope, by
fetrting· oulr afeElions upon the things above,
neot ulpon things on the earth. Let us walk
By fai'th, and not b~y fi~ght; and, arniidit
the obscurity of this faint and dubious
twilight, console ourselves with the ex-
pedation of a brighter day which is soon
to open. This earth is the land of fiha-
dows. But we hope to pass into the
world of realities; where the proper ob-

P'SALM iv. 4.

8 ER M. UCH communing with themselves
Ix. - there has alwa s been amongr man-

kind ; thaough frequently, God knows, to
no purpose, or to a purpose worf~ie than
none. Could we dis~cover the emplor-·
ments of men in retirement, how often
should we find their thoughts occupied:
with fubjedis, which they would be,
afhamedi to own ? What a large share~
have ambition and avarice,· at fomre times
'the grossest pafflons, and at other times-
t~he meaneit trifles, in their solitar-y muf-

ing~s ?

nings ? They carry the world, with all its SER 1I,
v-ices, into their retreat; and may be fagid Ix.
to dwell in the midst of the world, even
when they seem to ·be alone.

This, ifrely, is no~t that fort of com~-

muning which the Psalmist recommends.
For this is not properly communing with
oulr heart, but, rather, holding secret in-
tercourfe with the world, What the
PFalmlit means to recommend, is religi-
ous recolleAion; that elsercif~e of thought
which is conne~ted with the precept given
in the preceding words, to JLand in awe,
andu~n not. It is to cormmune with our-
selves under the chara~ter of spiritual
and immortal beings 3 and to ponder those
paths of oucr feet. which are leading us to
eternity. I shall, in the first place, show
the advantag-es .of s~uch ~serious r-etirement
and mneditation; and. shall, in the second
place, point out some of the principal
fabjedts which ought to employ us in our
re~treat.

The advantages of .retiring. from the

wyorld, to commune with oulr heart, will be

G g founad

8 ER M. found to b~e great, whether we regard our
jX. .happiness in this woarld, or our prepara-

~tion fort thle world· to come.

LrrT us confider themi firit, with re-

f~pedt to our happiness in this world. It
wtiill readily occur to you, that an entire
rsetreat from worldly affadirs, is not what:
religion requires ; nor does it even enjoin
a great retreat from them. Som~e flations
of life would not permizt this; andr there
are few Rtationis which render it necessary.
The chief field, both of the duty and of
the improveimelnt of man, lies in adtive

lf.By the graces anda virtues which he

exercises amidst his fellow-creatures, he
is trained up for heaven. A total retreat
from the world, is to far from being, as
the Roman Catholick Church holds, the
perfea~ioni of religion, that, some parti-
cular cafies excepted, it is no other than
thie abus~e of -it.

But, though entire retreat would lay

us aside from thie part fo~br wthich Provi-
dence chiefly intendedi us, itr is certain,

that~,

that, without occafiorial retreat, we mut .SE R M
a~t that part very ill. There will bre IX.,
ne~ither conniftency in the condu(5t, nor
dignity in the charaft~er, of one who fCets
apart no fhaare of his time for meditation
and: refle £ion. In the heat and bustle of
life, while patlion is every moment throw-
ing false colours on the obje £1s around us,
nothing canl be viewed in a just light. If
you with that Reason thlould exert her
native power, you must flep aside from
the crowd, into the cool, and silent thade.
It is there that, with sober and fleady eye,
thfe examines what is good or ill, what is
wrife or foolish, in human condu~t; she
looks back on the past, the looks forward
to the future; and forms plans, not for
the pr-esent moment only, but for the
whole of life. HEowr houldd that mnan d~if
Scharge any part of his duty aright, who
never fiuffers his passions to cooll ? nd.
flw should his passions cool, wmho is en-
gaged, without interruptionl, inl the tu-
mxuls of the world ? This in-cefiant flir
mnay be called, the perpetual drunken-

rnefs

bER M. ness of life. It raises that eager ferment-

S~L ation of s~pirit, wvhich will be ever f~end-

ing forth the dangerosus fumes of rashness
and folly. Whereas he who mingles re-
ligiozus retreat with worldly affairs, re-
miains calm, and master.0s hlimfelf. He
is not whirled round, and rendered gid-
dy, by the agitation of the world ; but,
fErom that sacred: retirement, in which he
has been conversant. amlongb higher ob-
jecs, comles forth into th~e world with
manly tranquillit-y, fortified by the prin-
ciples which he has formed, and prepared
for whatever may befall.

As he who is unacquainted with re-

treat, cannot s~ustain any charad~er witha
propriety, so neither can he enjoy the
world with any advantage. Of t'e two
dlafes of men who are most apt to be ne-
gligent of this duty, the men of pleas~ure,
and the men of busines~s, it is hard to fai~y
which fuffer most, in point of enjofl-
ment, from that negledt. To the former.
every momnent appears to be 10 £1, which
part~akes not of the vivacity of amusement.

To

To conneA one plan of gaiety with anos 8 ER N
ther, is their sole fludy - till, in a very /Ix.~
short time, nothing remain but to tread
the fame beaten round; to enjoy what
they have already enjoyed, and. to fiee
w6hat they have often seen. Pleas~ures
thus drawn to the dregs, become vapid
and tadtelefs~. Wthat mighlt have pleas~ed
long, if enjoyed with temperaince, and
mningled with retirement, being· devoured
wyith fuceh eager haste, speedily surfeits
and disgusts. Hfence, there are the per-
sons, who, after having run through a
rapid tcourf~ie of pleasure, after having
glittered for a few years in the fbremoft
line of publick amusements, are the moR
apt to fly at last to a melancholy retreat;
not led by religion or reason, but driven
by difrappointed hopes, and exhauffed
fhpirits, to the .pensive concllufion, that all
as zvamyt~.
.; If uninterrupted intercours~e with the
wiorld wears out the man of pleafurre, it
110 les~s oppreffeks the man of business and
ambjitioni. The firongeft spirits must ait

length

SER M. length fink under it. TFhe happiest tem-

~i per must he soured by incessant return~s

of the opposition, the inconstancy, and
treachery of: men. For he who lives al--
·ways in the bustle of the worldt, lives in
a perpetual warfare. Here an enemy en-
counters; there, a rival supplants him.
The ingratitude of a friend flings him,
this hour; and the pride of a fulperiour
wounds him, the next. In v~ain hte flies
for relief, to trifling amnufernents. These
-may afford a temporary opiate to care;
·but they communicate no firength to the
mind. On the contrary, they leave it
mnore ifoft and defenceless, when mnoleft-
ations and injuries renew their attack.

Let: him who wishes for an ·effedtua~l

cure to all the w~ounds which the world
can infliat, retire frot -intercours~e with
men, to intercours~e with G~od. WTheni
he enters into his closet, and ithts the
door, let him shut out, at the famne time,
·all itrrduion of worldly care; and .dwell

this life, foQ,

I w the second place, it is aibolutely

necessary in order to prepare us for the
life to come. He who lives always in
publick, cannot live to his own foul.
The~ world lieth in *wikednefs; and with
good reason the Christian is exhorted, not
to be cocnformzed to it, bult trcans~formed by the
renewing of his mind, Our convlerfation
and intrercourfe with thie world, is,, in
several respects, an education for vice.
From our earliest youth, we are accuffom-·
ed to hear riches and honours extolled; as
the chief poffrefions of man ; and - pro-
pos~ed to us, a~s the principal aim. of our
future purfixits. We are trained up~ to
look with admiration an the flattering
marks of dliftinefian which they beffow.
In qureft of ther~e fancied blessings, we kee

trent, Principles of duty we may,. per,
kae, hpar som~etimes incul<;ted; -but

we seldom behold them brought into 8 ER M.
Competition w~Gith wieorldly pr'ofit. The IX.
ifoft names, and plausible colours, under
which deceit, f~enfutality, and revengre,
are pefeaeted to us in; common dif~courrf~e
wveaken, by degrees, our natural s~ens~e of
the diftindtion between good and e~vil.
WVe often meet with crimes authorized
by high examples, and rewarded wlith
the caresses and fiitiles of the- w~orld. 'We
dificover, perhaps, at last, that those
wrhom we were taug~ht to revrerence, and
to r~eg~ard as our patt~erns of condri~t,
aA upon principles no purer than those
of others.--Thus breathing habitually a
contagious air, how certain is our r~uin,
unless we fiometimnes retreat from this
pestilential region, and seek for proper
corredtives of the disorders whkich~ are
contradted there ? Religious 'retirement
both abates the difieafe, and fEurnifhes thte
remedy. It lessens the corrupting influ-
ence: of the world ; and it gives o~ppor-
tunity for better principles lto exert their
power. H~e wiho- is accuffone'd to turn

L/r v1.7~ the m~ultitude do not tell· him. A mnorte

fiournd infirudior will lift his voice, and:
awaken wit~hin the heart those latent fu~g-
geftions,. which the world had overpow7ver-
ed and suppressed.

The a~ts of prayer and devotion, the~

exercises of faith and repentance, all the:
great and peculiar duties of the religion
of Christ, neceigrily fuppef~e retirement
fromn thze w~orld. This. w'as one chief end
of th~eir institution, that they might be
the means of occafiionally s~equestering us
from that: great fcere of vice and folly,
the continued prefience of which is so~s
hurtfill. Solitude is the hallowed ground
which religion hathi, in every age, cho~en
for- her own. There, her· inspiration is·
felt,. and her secret .mnyteries elevate the
foul. There, f~alls th~e tear of contrition ;
there, rifies towards h~eav7en the sigh of the
heart; there, melts the foul wit~h all- thei
t-enderness o~f devotion, and pours its~elf
forth, before him who made,. ·and hier

who is uanacquatinte~d with such· employj-

heaven he thre habitation of pure affec-
tions, and- of intelleAual joy, can ifuch
slate· be reifh~ed by him who is always
immrer~ed· among ifenfible objeats, and has
never acq~uired any taste for the pleas~ures
of the underflanlding, and the heart ?

The great and the worthy, the pious

and, the virtuous, have ever been addia-
ed to; serious rettirene-nt. It is the char-
radterificik of little and frivolous minds,
to be wholly occupied wtiith the vulgar
objeds of life. EThefe fill up their de-
fires, and supply aH the entertainm~ent:
which their coarse apprehensions can re-
lifh. But a more refined and enlarged
mind leaves the worlId behind it, ~feels a
ca~ll~ for higher pleasures, and feets· them
mn retreat. The man of publick sp~ir~it
haS recoure to it, in ord~er to form plans
for genera~l good; the man of genius, in
order to dwell on his favourite themes;
the philosopher, to perfue his discoveries;

the e~vening tide. Davrid, amidst all the
flplendour of royalty, often bears woitnefls
both to 'the pleafu-ire which he receivted,
and the benefit which he reaped, front

own heart, and my /pirit made dihg~ent
fjarchI. I thought on my ways, and turn-
ed my feet unlto God's testimonies. In~ the
mulltitu~de of thoughts =withinf me, his com-
forts delight -mny Soul. Our blessed~ Sa-
viour himself, though ozs all wvho ever
lived on earth he needed least th~e assist-
ance of religious retreat, yet, by his fre-
quent pradtice, has done it signal honour,
Often were the garden, the mountain,
and the silence of the night, fought byp
him, for intiercourfe with Heaven. When
he had sent the multitucde away, he went ucp
into a mountaint, apart, to pray.

The advantag~es of religious r'etirem~ent

will still more clearly appear, by confider-
inrg, as wvas prE~optied, in the nexit~ place,
some of thos~e great objedts w~hich should

plai'n and acknowledged importance ;
God, the world, and our own charadf~er.

commu~ne weith youcr hearts concerning God.
ImprefiTons of Deity, besides their being
the· principle of what is firiatly termed
rehigion, are'the great~ fuxport of all moral
featirnent, and virtuous condudt, among
men. But with what dlificulty are they
pres~erved in any due degree of force,
amidst the .affairs and avocations of the
world ? While the crowd of surrounding
objeAs is ever rushing· on the imagina-
tion, .and occupying the fienfes and the
heart, what is not only abs~ent from view,
but, by its nature, invisible, is apt to va-
nifh like a shadow. Hence it is given
as the charader of wicked men, in ferip-

wYhofe fallacious art's it highly imports us
to detedt. But in the midit of its pleafuzres
and purifuits, the detedtion is impossible.
WNe tread, as within an inchanted circle,
where nothing appears as it truly is. It
is· only in retreat, that: the charm can be
brok~en. Did men emp~loy that: retreat',
not in carrying on the delusion which the
world has begun, not in forming plans
of imaginary blis~s, but in fulbjeding the
happinef's which the world ·affords to a
firiA difernfion, the spell woulld dissolve;
and in the room of the unreal profpeAs,
wihich had long ·amused them, the naked-
ness of the· world would appear.

Prepare yourselves, then, to encounter

the light of truth. Resolve rather to. bear

the

paradise of fools. .While others media
tate in secret on the means .of. attaining
worldlly furccefs,, let it ,be your employ-
mr]ent: to s~crutinize that s~uccess itelef. Cal-
culate fairly to what: it amounts 3 and
whether you are not los~ers on the whole,
by your apparent: gain. Loo~k back, for
this purpos~e, on your paft-life. Trace it-
fr~om your earliest youth; and put the
question to yourselves, What have beenI
its happiest periods ? Were they thofre of
quiet and ~innocence, or thos~e of ambis
tion and intrigue ? H-as your real enjoy-
ment: uniformly kept pace with what, the;
world calls pros~perity ? As you advanced
in wealth or Rtation, did you proportion-.
ably advance in happines~s ? Has succes~s,
almost in any one instance, fudfilled your
expe £ations ? Where you reckoned upon
most -enjoyment, have you not: often found
least ? Wherever guilt entered into ypur

While you commune with your heart

concerning what the world now is, con-
fider also what it will one day appear to
be. Anticipate the awful moment of your
bidding it an eternal farewell. Think,
what refleAions shall most probably arif'e,
when you are quitting the field, and look-
ing back on the s~cene of adtion. In what
light will your closing eyes contemplate
thos~e vanities which now shine to bright,
and those interelis which now iwell into,
s~uch high importance ? W~hat part wilL
you then with to have adted: ? What shall
then appear momentous, what trfting
in human conduat ?-L-et the sober senti-
ments which su~ch anticipations s~uggest,
temper now your mi~splaced ardour. Let
the last conclusions which you thall form,

Moreover, in communing wtith yours

selves conlcening the world, contemplatei
it as fubjecZ to the Divine dominion. The
greater part of men behold nothing more:
than the rotation of h~uman aff~airs. Th-ey
fee a great crow~d ever in motion ; the
fortunes of men alternately rising and
falling ; viirtue often diffreffed, and ~pro-
fperity appearing to be the. purchas~e of
wrorldly w~isdom. But this is only ~thec
outside of things. Behind the curtain,
there is a far greater scene, which is be-
held by none but the retired, reig~ious
fpedator. Lift up t~hat curtain, when
you are alone writh G-od. Viewi the wForkle
with th~e eye of a Chriftiacn;. and ypou

moavements of the human frame. In or- SER 10.
der to operate with s~uccess on the adtive x·
powers, the heart must be gained. Sen-
timent and affeacion must be brought to
the aid of reafou. I-t is not enough that
men believe religioni to be a wife and ra-
tional rule of conduA, unles~s they relish
it as agreeable, and find it to carry its
own reward. H~appy is the man, w~ho,
in the confliai of desire between God anrd
the world, can oppofre, not only argu-
ment to argument, but pleas~ure to plea-
s~ure; who, to the external allur'emnents of
~sense, can ·oppofie the internal joys of de;-
votion; and to the uncertain promil~es of
a flattering world, the certain experience
of thzat peace of God wehich pafetlh un~der-
Jtandinsg·, keeping hisr mind and heart. ·Such
is the temper and spirit of a devout~ man.
Such was the charadter of Cornelius, that;
good centurion, whose prayers and alms
are said to have come zip in memtorial before
God. Of this charadter I int~end,- through
Divine affiffance, to difcourfe;j an-d halll
endeavour, I. To explain the nature of

L 1 devotion ;

SE RM~ devotion ; ·rI. To juff~ify, and recommend

Jx.v it; and, III. ·To red~ify- fame mistakes,

conerni~ng it.

I. DEVOnowN is the ~lively exercis~e of

those affeations, which ~we owe to the
Supreme Being. It comprehends several
emotions o-f the heart, which all termi-
nate on the fame great objea., The chief
of them are, veneration, gratitude, desire,
and resignatio~n.

It implies, firit, profound veneration

of God, :·By veneration, I understand~ an,
affedtion compouanded of: awe and love;
tihe affeation which, of all others,, it best
becomes creatures to bear towards their:
infinite~ly perfedt Creator. . Awe .is the
first fCentiment whivbch ris~es in the fou~l,. at
the view of his grearne~s,. But, in - the
heart of a devout man, it i~s a s~olemn and
elevating, .not a dlejeding,. emotion ; for
he glows, rather than trembles,; in. the
Divine presence. - It is not the fixperft~i-
teiou d~read of unknown· power, ~but; the
homage yielded by the heart to hima who-

is,

:is at once, the greatest and th~e be~st of Be- SE·R M.
ings. Omnipotence, viewed alone, would x.S
Ibe a formidable objeat. Burt, considered.
in conjundtion with the moral perfeaions
of the Divine Nature, it s~erves to h~eighten
devotion. G~oodlnefs affects th-e heart with
double energy, when residing in Onae to
·exalted. The goodn~ess which we adore
in him, is not like that which is common
among men, a weak, mutable, ~undif`-
cerning fondness, ill qualified to be the
ground of afrured trust~. It is thettt~~~l goodi-
ness of a perfed~ Go~vernour, nain~g ulpon
a regular, extensive plan.; a- Rteady prin-
:ciple of benevolence, conduated by wifr
dom; which, f~ubjea to no variablene/s or
}hadow of turning, free from all partiality
and caprice, incapable of being· either
~soothed by flattery, or ruffled by res~ent-
ment, refemnbles, ini its calm and equal
lufire, - the eternal serenity of the highest
heavens. Thy me~rcy, O Lord ! is inr the hea-
vens, land thGy faithCfuslne/s rea~ch~eth unto the~
clouds. Thy righteouf~ne/s is like the great moun-
tains, anrd th~y jutdgmzents ar~e a great dEepth.

Lia Suxch

SER M. Such are t~he conceptions of the great

x. God, which fill with veneration the heart

of a .devout man. His: veneration is not:
confined to adts of inunediate worship.
It is the habitual temper of his foul.
Not only when engaged in prayer or
praise, but in the s~ilence of retiremenlt,
and even amidst the occupations of the
world, the D~ivine Being dwells upon his
thoughts. No place, and no objeA, ap-
pear to him void of God. On the works
of Nature, he views the impreflion of his
hand; and in the a~ions of men, he
traces the operation of his Providence.
Whatever he beholds on earth, that is
beautiful or fair, that is great or g~ood,
he ref'ers to God, as to the supreme .0ri-
gin of all thre excellence wh~ich is s1catter-
ed throughlout· his works. From t~hos~e
effeats, he rises to th~e first cause. From~
thofCe fireams, he asc~ends to the fountain
whence they flow. By those rays, he is
led to that eternal source of light in
wFihich ·they centre.

3D3EvoTrIoN implies, s~econdly, <fincere strrln

gratitud:~e to God, for all his benefits. K
This is a warmer. emotion than· fmple
veneration. Venerat'ion looks up to -the
Deity, as he is in hims~elf ; Gratitude re-
.gards what he is tow~ards us. When a
devout man surveys this vast univerfre,
where beauty and goodness are every-
where pred~omninanlt; when he reflefts on
thos~e numnberlefs multitudes of creatures,
who, in their diff~erent stations, enjoy the
bleflings -of exitenrce; and whlen at the
fame time he looks up to an Univerfial
. Father, who hnath thus filledl creation with
life and hap~pines~s, his heart glowrs withlin
him. He adores that difinteret~ed good-
nes~s, which prompted the Almighty to
rais~e up so many orders of intelligent be-
ings, not' that he might receive, but that
he might give and impart; that he might
pour fbrth himfielf, and communicate to
'the spirit~s which he formed, some ema-
nations of his felicity.

The goodness of this Supreme Benuefac-

tor he gratefully contemplates, as display-

& E-R M. ed: in his Owri iate. He reviews the

X. events of his life; and, in every com-

fort ~which has fw~eekened it, he dis~cerns
the Divine hand. Does h~e remember
with affe~tion -the parents under whose
care he grew up, and the companions
with wh~iom he pafred his youthful life ?
Is he now happy, in his family rising
around hi-ni; in the spouse who loves
him, or in the children whoi give himn
comfort and joy ? Into every ,t~ender re-
rnembrance of the past, and every pleaS-
·ing ·enjoyment of the present, devotion
enters; for in all tho~se beloved objeas,~
it recognizes God. The cozmmu~nication
of love fromI he~aritU rto hart, is an effiion
of his goodnefls. From his inspiration,
def~cendis all the friendship wh~ich ever
glowed on earth; and 'thereford~e, to him
it justly returns in gr~atitude, andl termi-
nates on himn.

But this life, with all its interett, is

brLit a fmnall part: of humran exiflence. A
devout: man lookrs forward to im~morta-
lity, ·aid, discovers still higher f~ubjeAs of

g~ratitude,

creature, whom Divine benignity has re- X.
seived into gra~ce,; whos~e fbrfeited hopes
it has restored; and to whom it has opisn-
ed the most g~lorious prof~pe £ts of future
felicity. Such generosity shown to .the
fallen ~and mifierable, is yet more affeet-
ing to the heart, than favours conferredt
on the innocent. He contemplates with
astonishment, the labours of the Son
of God, in accomplishing redemnption
for men; and his foul overflow8s with
t~hankfillnef~s to him who~5 loved ucs, and
washed cs from our }nzs in his o~wn blood.-
What }hall I render· to the Lord for all his·
.beneif t ? Bless the Lord, O mby oul ! and all
that is weithin me, ble/s his holy namne; wzaho
forgivetha all thine iniquities, . and healeth
all thy dzfleaf~s ; woho red~eemeth thy ~fe froms
def~rd~ion, and crowneth thee weith loving
kindne~j, and ·with tendrer. mercies.

DEVOTION implies, thirdly, trhe d~e-

fire of the foul after the favour of the Su-
pr-eme B~eing, as its chief good, and final

reit.

E ER Mi reit. To inferiour enjoym~ents, th~e d~eVut~

*. man allots inferiour and fCecondary: atitach;

ment. He disclaims not every earthly
affedion. He pretends not to renounce
all pleaf~iure in. the comforts of his pre-
~feat filate. Such1 an uln-natural renanciai·
tion humnanityg forbids, and reli-gion can-
notE require. Bu-t from thes~e he expeats
not his ithpfreme blif~is. He difo~erns the
vanity whziclh belongs to thiem all; and
beyond the circle o-f muitable ·objeats
which fuirro~und him, he aspires after
fomne principle ·of more perfea felicity,
which shall not be furbjea to change or
decay. But wher~e is this complete and
permanent gooad to be found ? Ambition
purs~ues it in couzrts and palaces ; an~d re-
turns from the purfhiit, loaded with for-
rows. Pleafuire s~eeks it amonig: fen~ua~l
joys·; and ret~ies with the confeflion of"
dis~appointment. The dee~p/aith, it ·is not· ina

cantnot· be goateetnf~or gold ; nzeither }hall filnver

This fiurely, is one of the nobleff ads

of :which, the human mind is capable,
when thus, ifwe may be allowed the,.ex-

pref lion,,

pre1ion, it unites its~elf with God. Nor 8 ER M.
·can any devotion -be genuine, which in- x.
spires not f~eatimnents of this nature.· Fr
devotion is not to be consider~ed ais a tran-
fient glow of affe~tion, occasioned by some
cafuzal impreilionrs of Divine goodnes~s,
which are fuffered to remain unconnecded
with the condua of life. It, is a power-
ful principle, which penetrates the foul;
which purifies the affe~tions from de~baf~-
ing attachmnents; and, by a fixed and
fleacly' regard. to God, fulbdues every fin-
ful pafflon, and forms the inclinations to
piety and virtue.

SUnH in general are the dispositions

that confitunte devotion. It is the union
of veneration, gratitude, desire, and re-
fignation. It expresses, not so muich the
performance of any particular duty, as
the s~pirit which ~must animate all religi-
·ous duties. It flands opposed, not mere-
ly to downright vice ; but to a heart
4which ~is cold, and insensible to fascrbd
things ; which, froin compulfiin perhaps,

M m 2 and.

·E R M. and a ienfe ofE interest, preserves some re-

x. gard to t~he Divine commands, but obeys

Lfr1;/ them without ardour, love, or joy. I

proceed,·

.II. To recommend this devout [pirit

to. your imitation. I begin with obf~ery-
ing, That it is of the utmoRt consequence
to guard against extremes of every kind
in religion. We mnuft beware, left, by
f~eekring to avoid one rock,~ we iiilit u~pon
another. It has been long the fCubjeat of
remark, that superstition and enthufiafmn
are two capital sources of deluf ion ; fu-
per~t~ition, on the one hand, attaching:
mnen, wit~h immoderate zeal, to the ritual
and external part of religio~n; and enthu-
fiafm, on the other, ·direding their whole
.attention to internal ·emotions, and Imy-
flical communications wi~th the spiritual
.world;~ while neither- the one, nor t~he
other, has~ aid ifuffcient r gard to the
great mroral duties of the Chriftia . life.
Bu~t, running with intemperate eagerness
from thes~e two great abuses of rel~igin,.

mlenR

rnen have negledted to obs~erve, · that ~there s-E'R M
are extremes opposite to each of· thens, X.
into which thley are in hazard of precipi-
tating themselves. Thus the. ho~rrour of
s~uperst~ition has sometimes reached t~o far,
as to produce contempt for all external
infituutions; as if it were pofirble for
r-elig~ion to fatbfift in -the world, without:
forms of wvorfhip, or publick acknow-
ledgment of God. It has also happened,
that some who in the main are well as-
fedted to the cause of goodnes~s, obs~erving
that persons of a devout *turn, have at:
times been carried by warm. affedious,
into unjuffifiable excesses, have then~ce
hastily concluded, thait all devoti~on was
akrin to enthufiafmn; and, s~eparating reli-
gion totally from the heart and affe~tions,
have reduced it to a frigid-obf~ervance of
what they call the rules of virtue. This
is th~e ·exteme wchich I purpose at pres~ent
to combat, by showing you, firit, That
true devotion· is rational, and well ~found-
ed; nex~t, That it is of the highet im-
portance- to every other part of religion

and

'.4ER M. and virtue; and, laftfly, _ That it is most

x. conducive to our happiness.

'L/vt/l

lIr the first place, True devotion is ra-

tional, and well founded. It takes its rife
from affe~tions, which are essential to the

with greater ardour ; and, if to be un-
moved, in: the former cafe, argues a defed5
of sensibility in our powers, it dis~covers,
in th~e latter, an odious hardnes~s and de-
pravity in the heart. The tendernefis of
an affeaionate parent, the generosity of
a forgiving enemy, the publick s~pirit of a

accomplished on his followers, he did not

and tender, yielding to the Divine irn-
pulse, and readily s~usceptible of devout
imnpreflions. Thou }h~alt love the Lord th5y

not eafyp to conceive what other olfefeing
we can present, that will be acceptable
t~o himn.

Of what natyre must thrat man's reli-

gion, be,: who profeffes to wcorfhip God,
and to believe in Christ; and yet raises
his thoughts towards God, and his Savi-
our, -without any warmth of gratitude or
]ove ?I speak not of thos~e occasional de-

cays

SER M. cayps of piorus affedion, to which the best:
~x. are s~ubject, but of a total inf~enibility to

this part of religion.· Surely, let the out-
wvard behaviour be ever so ir~reproachable,
there must be some e~ssential defedt i~n a
heart, which remans always unmoved at
the view of infinite -goodnes~s. The as-
fec~ions cannot, in this caf~e, be deemed
to flow in their natural charnnel. Some
concealed malignity mult have tainted
the inward ·frame. This is not: the man
whom you would chufe for your bosom-
fidend ; or whose heart you could exped
to ans~wer, with reciprocal warmth, to
yours. His virtue, if it deferelves that
-name, is not of the most amiable fort;
and may, with reason, receive the appel-
lation (often injudiciously beffowved) of
·cold and dry morality. Such a person
muff, as yet, be far from the kingdomz of
He-;-acven.

As devotion is thus essential to religion

in its principle, so it enters into the pro-
·per.dif~ch~ai-g·e of all its duties. It diffhfies
;an aus~picio~us influence over the whole

of vi~rtue. .The; prevailing tremper of ·lthe 8 ER M.1
.mind is formed. by. its mo t~ frequent emr X;
ployments. Ilnter~courf~e wtith Supreme
perfe(Siton cannot, therefore, but ennoble
and improve it. The pure love of God,
naturally conneAs itfrelf with the love of
man. . Hence, devotion has been often
rfounrd a powerful. infitrument, in human-
izing the manners of men, and taming
their unruly pafflons. It· fixooths what
is rough, and softens wvhat is fierce, in
our nature. It is the great purifier of the
afFe~ions. It ins~pires contemapt of the
low gratifications belonging to animal
life. It promotes a humble and chearful
contentment with our lot; and s~ubdues
that eager desire of riches and of power,
which has filled this unh'appy world with
crimes and mis~ery. Finally, it beffows
that enlargement of heart in the s~ervice
of God, which is the great principle,
both of perseverance, and of progress in
virtue. He who, unacquainted with de-
vout affeaions, sets hims~elf to keep the
Divine comomandtments, will advance is

likre one who, S-rringca~: he'y burdeil,
toils 'tb ~mdunt the hill.~ B ut he~ whose
hieart: devotion· has warmed, wuiill proceed
orthis d~ay, chearful and r~ejoicing. The
one performs his duty, only b-ecause it is
c~ommanded~;the other,: becaulei he loves

i.The one -is inclined· to do no miore

than' neceffty requires; t~he other seeks
to excell. T~he one looks for his reward
in somewhat besides religion; the other
fi~nds it in religion itself: It is his meat
Eznd drinik to do the *w~ill of that heavsenlyr
Father, whomn he loves an'd adores. WJhichi
-of these two are likrely to make the great-
-eft improvement in goodness, is easily
dif'cerned. Let us now confider,

: .IN the third place, the influence of de
vrotion on the happinefsj of: life. Whatever
promotes and firengthens virtue, what-
ever calms and regulates the temper, is a
foulrce of happiness. Devotion, as I have
just now show~n, produces those effedts in
a remark~able degree. It inspires compo~

2 s~ure

fut.e of spirit, mildness;, and bertignity ; -E.R M;
weakens the painful, and cheris~hes the X.
plealmng emotions ; and, by these means,
carries on the life of a pions man in a
Emooth and placid tenour.

Besides exerting this ~habiitual influence

on the mind, devotion opens a field of
enjoyments, to which the vitious are en-
tire firangers; enjoyments the more valu-
able, as they peculiarly belong to retire-
mEzent when the world leaves us, and to
adversity when it becomes our foe. These
are the two s~easons, for which every wife
man would most wifLh to provide some
hlidden fltore of co~mfort. For let: him be
placed in the most favourable situation
wvhich the human state admits, the world
can neither always amuse him, nor al-
~ways shield him from diffref~s. There
~will be many hours of vacuity, and
many of d~eje~tion in his life.. If he he
a firanger to God, and to devation, how
dreary will the g~loom .of solitude often
prove ? With what oppreflive weight will
facknef~s, disappointment, or old ag~e, fall

Oo upon

bER M. upon his ifpirit~s ? But, for those pensive

~EJ periods, the pious man has a relief pr-e-

pared·. Fr~m the tiresome repetition of
the comnionn vanities of life, or from the
painful corrosion of its cares and forrowrs,
devotion transports him into a new re-
gion ; and f~urrolunds him there witih su~ch
objeAs, as are the most fitted to chear the
dej~eaion, to calm the tumults, and to
hi~al the wtounds of htis heart. If t~he
wyorld has been empty and delusive, it
gladdens him with the- profped of a
higher and better order of things, about
to arise. If men have been ungrateful
and base, it: dis~plays before him the
faithfulnefs of that Supreme Being, who,
though every other friend fail, will never
for~ake· him.-C6onfullt your experience,
and you will find, that the two greatest
sources o~f inward joy, are, the exercis~e of
l~ove direAed- towards a deserving obj~ea,
and the exercise of hope terminating on
some high and afibred happiness. ..Both
ther~e are suppli~ed by devotion; and
therefor~e we hatve no reason to be fur-

prifed,

hearts of good men with a f'atisfaflijon not Ix.
to be expref~ed.

errors, into ·which men are apt to fa8ll
coner'ning, devotion. . For it is but std~o
ob~vi~ous, tha . errors are often committed·
'in this part of religion. There fr-equently

disfigure

disflgu~re its appearance before the world, s FR so
and fubjectit to unjust reproach. Let is x.
therefore attend delib~erately to its nature,
so as to distinguish pure and rational de-
votion, of which I have hitherto treated,
7from that which is, in any de~gree, f~puri-
ous and adulterated.

In the first place, Ilt is an error to

place devotion in the mere performanc~e
of any external aft of worship. Pray'er
and prais~e, together with the- ordinances
peculiar to Christi~an relig~ion, are ;the
aIppointeed means of raising the heart too
·wards the Supreme BSeing. ·They are the
inflituted signs o~f devotion;, the language
in which it naturally expreffs its~elf. Bult
let us remem~ber, that they are signs and
exprefiions only ; and we all know, that,
in various cafes, there may not clorrefp~ond
to the thing signified. .It is in the dif~po-
fition of the heart, not in the motion :of
the lips, ~or in the poftere ·of.the body,
thalt devotion consists. The heart mayS
pzray or pralife, when no words are utter-
ed. But if the heart be unconcerned orr

SE;R M. ill affe61ed, all t~he wordsi we can uftte

x. ho~w properly framed soever, ar~e no other

than' empty and unacceptable f~ounds in
the ear of the At~lmighty.

IN the fetond place, It' is ·an error to

conceive the pleasures and advanta~ges of
dev~otion, to ·be- indifcriminatrely open tou
a~lL Devotiion,' like marlny parts of reli-
g-ion, may in some lig~hts be confiidered
at a privilege, and in: orher~s as a duty.
·t is ·the duty of atll, ·to love God, and to
resign themfeltves to his will~. . Bt it is
:the privuileg~e of good menr? only, to re-
jice in God,. and to confitde in his
~friendship. IHence a certain preparat~ion
is reqtrif~i~te, for the enjoyment -of devtri~on
in i~ts whole extent. N'ot only must: the
lif be re~formed, from gross enormities,
-but the ~heart must: have undergone that

hsange whjich t~he GofTpel ·demrands. · A
~cmimpetent knowledge· of God must .be
-acquired. A proper: foundation mRnuf be
laid in faith and repen~tanc~e, foi- inter;

~orkfe w~ith He~Lar~n.

TThey

the arms of the world, ito thre sacre~d 5-'
retreat of devotion ; they who imagine
that retreat to fland alw~cays ready for ther
recept~ion of such as betake themfielves to
it, for no reason, but because every other
refuge excludes them, betray gross igno-
r-ance of this part of religion. They bring
to it, faculties unqlualified to taste its plea-
fuxres; and they grafpl at hopes to whichL
they are not entitled.· By incorporating
w~ith devotion the unnatu~ral mixture of
their unf~andtified passions, they defile and
corrupt it. H~ence, that gloom which has
often s`pread over it. Hence, thos~e super-
flitious mortifications and aufferities, by
whrlich the falsely devout hope to purchas~e
~favour from God; haunted by the t~er-
rours of a guilty conifequenca and vainly
Itru~ggling to fuibftitute a servile and
cringing homage, in the room of the purd
affektions of a renewed heart. On fuchn
altars, the hallowred fire of true devotion
cannot burn; nor can any incense as~cend.
from them, that fhnall be grateful to Hea-

Then draw nih to God, and he will draw
nzsh to you.--- But though devotion re-
quires a p~ure heart, and a virtuous life,
and necessarily fulppof~es the exercis~e of
frequent retirement, I must observe,

IN the third: place, That it is an error

to conceive it as requiring an entire re-
treat from the world. Devotion, lik-e.
every other branch ~of religion, was~in-
tended to fit us for dis~charging· the duties
of life. We serve God, by being usefu~l
to one another. It is evident: from the
fr~ame of our nature, and from our com-
mon necefirties and wants, that we were
designed by Providence for an adtive part
on this earthi~. The Gospel ofChrift, ac-.
cordingly, considers us as engaged in the
concerns of the world; and - direats its
exhortations to men in all the various re-~
lations, charadters, and employments of

I civill

fore and total dedication of our time to 1v
devrout exercis~es, cannot bie the most pro-
jper method of acquiring the favour of
God.

I mean not, however, to throw any

blame on thos~e, who having loft all relish
for the oi-dinary ptxtfuits of life, in con-i
fiequelace of severe wounds which they
have received from a~f~iaion ; who, be-
ing left to fland alone, and discern-·
ing their connedtions with the world to
be in~ fame m~easure broken off, choo~se
to seek: tranqu~ilhty mna. rehigious retire-
ment, and to consecrate thei~r days entire-
ly to God. Situnations s~ometimes occur,
wrhich both juffify a great degre~e of
r~et-reat from the world, and entitle it to
refp~ed. But, with regard to the bulk~
of mjankinds Christian devotion neither
req~uires nor implies any fuxch f~equeftra-
tion from the affairs of inen. Na-y, for
the rinof part,- it wtill be culltivated with~~·1
greater fuccef's by Thee who Imzingle ~it
with the adive emp~loyments of life.. :For

P 8 the

8~ ER M. the mind, when entirely occupied~ by: any

x. ·onet objeat is in hazard of viewmng it at

last through a falf~~ie medium. Qbje £s,
Sefpec"ially, so great and s~ublime as those~
of devotion, when we attempt to fix upon
theml unaremitting attention, overitretch
and disorder our feeble powers. The
mindi, by being relaxed, returns to them
withz more advantage. As none of our
organs can bear intense s~ensations with-
out in~jury ; as the eye, when dazzled
with overpowering light, beholds ima-
ginary colours, and loses the real diftinc-
tion of objeCts; so the mind, when over-
heated by perpetual contemplation of ce-
leftial thingrs, has been fbmetimes found
to mistake the firong imnpreflions of fancy,
for s~upernatural communications from
above. To the employments of devotion,
as to all other things, there are due limits,
There is a certain temperate sphere, with-
in which it preserves longest its proper
exrertion, and most A~ccef~sfuzll promotes
the purpos~es for w~chich it w~as desi~gned.

'IN

SIN thei fourth place, It is an error to SER M.
imagiie, that devotion exijoins a total x.~
contempt of all the pleafiires and atnuf~e-
ments of human faociety. It checks, inl-
de~ed, that spirit of difi~pation which is
too prevalenit. It not only prohiibits plea-
fu~res which are unlawful, but likewise
that unlawful -degree of attachment to
pleasure~s ih themse~lves innocent, whichr
withdraws the atten~tion of men fTromn
;ihvat is serious and important. But it
brings amusement under due limita?;on,
wotithout extirpating it. It forbids it, as
thie business; but permits it, as the re-
lakgation, of life. For there is nothirw ux
the spirit of trixe religion, which is ho-
stile to a chearful enjoyment: of our· situ-
ation in the world.

They who look with a severe and in-

d~ig~nant eye, upon all the recreation by
which the cares of men are relieve, and
the uinion of society is cemented, are, in
tmo ref'pe~s, injurious to religion. Firit,
they exhibit it to others under a forbid-
d~ing form, by cloathing it wiith the g~arb

- IN the fifth place, ·It is - an erferi to
bel~ieve, that devotion souj~frifhe -a fpirirt~
of .severity, ina judging of tche ma~nners

charaCSter, brt· thiat of a fouixr Pnd rechrfe
bigot, who delights in centure,. But the
feproach is unjudt; for flich a s~pi~rit is
entirely opposite to the: nature of true~
devotion. The very first traces which it
imp~rin~ts on thie minrd, are' candouwr a~nd
humi~lity~. Its principles are liberal.: It's
genius is unaffinningt and. mild. Seviere
only to its~el~f, it makes. every allowance

you~i, either in some dodital: tene'ts, ~or
in the mode of exprefirng· thenti ; you may
reft assured, that to much pride you have·
joined much 'ignorairce, both of the nai-
ture of d~evotio~n, and of the GofCpel ds
C-hrit. Finally,

, IN th~e sixth· place, It is .an· error to-

think, that perpetual rwpture and f~piri-
tual joy belong to dievotion.. Dlevout.
feelings admit very differ~ent: degrees of
warmth and exak'ation. 6 Some; perforis,
by the ~frame of thieir :mindis,: a~re muchl
more fuf~lceptible than other~s, of thek ten-
der emotions. They more readily relent-

.at the view of Divine goodness, glo~wswth S, £-M.
a warmer· ardour of .Love, and, by goqf~ie- X.
quence,. rifre to a higher <;levation of -joy
and hope. But, in the midst of ftliR and
calm, affe £tions, devotion often d wells ;
and, though it produce no transports in
the mind, diffhf~es over it a Rieady fere-
-nity. Devout fenfagtions not only vary
in their degree, according to the frame
of different tempers; but, even among·
the best dis~pos~ed-, fuffer much interrulp-
tion and decay. It were too much to
expedt, that in the prefeat slate of hu-
man frailty, thos~e happy feelings thould
be uniform and conflant. Oppreilion of
worldly cares,~ languor of spirits, and in-
firmities, of health, frequently indispose
us for the enjoyment of devout affeE~rons.
Pious men, on these occasions, are in ha-
zard of paffmng judgment on their own
slate with too much severity ; as if, for
some great iniquity, they were condemnn-
ed by God to final hardnes~s of ·heart.
Hence arises that melancholy, which hasr
been s~een to overcloud .them ; and wthich

hlas

x. Reofs of ungodly~ inen. But it ;is a rne

lancholy which 'de~ferves ~to bte tre-ated
with tendernes~s, riot wit~h contempt. It
is tie- exc~ess of virtuous and piou~s fen
fibility. It Is the overflowin~g of a heart
affedted, in an extreme degree, with ~th~e
humble s~en~se of its own failings, and-
with~ ardenrt concern to attain the favour·
of God. A wpeakne~fs, howev~er,· wte ad~-
mit it to be;, though not a crimfie and
hold it to be perfeatly fCeparable from the
es fence of devotion, For contrition, :though
it mnay melt, oug~ht not. to s~inks or over-
power the heart of a Christian. The tear
of repentance brings its own relie, Re·-
ligion is a spring of consolation, not of
terrouxr, to every wtell informed mind,
which, in a proper manner, rests its hope
on the infinite goodness of G od, and t~he
all-fuifficient: merit of ChBrif~t,

To conclude, Let us remov~e from dei-

v~otion, al~l thos~e mistakes, to which the
corrup~tions of men, ·or their ignorance·

2 and

aind prejudices, have given rife. With us, sER 191.
let it-be-the worship of God in Spirit: and ~
inz truth5 ; .the elevation of' the foul towards
him, in funplicity: and love. L~et us pur-
fiie it as the principle of virtuous condud1,
and of inward peace. By frequent: and
serious meditaition brn the great obje £ts of
religion, let us lay ourselves open to its
influence. By means of the institutions
of the CGofpel, let us cherifhl its impref-
florts. And, above all, let its pray tod
G-od, that he may establish its power in
our heatrt. For here, if any where, his
afif~tance is requisite. The spirit of de-
votion .is his gift. From his ins pir ation
it proceeds. Towvards.him it tends; and
in- his prefience hereafter, it shall attain
its fix11 perfection.

deration, vigilance, and felf-government,
are duties incumbent on all; but efpeci-
ally on su~ch as are beginning the journey
of life. To themn, therefore, the admo-
nition in the Text is, with great propriety,
dire~ed ; though there is reason to fear,
that by them it is in hazard of being~

least regarded.: Experience enforces ~the S·ER M.·
admonition ·on: the moft~giddy, after they Xf
have advanced .ia. years.., But the, whole
slate of youthfiul views and pafihons, is,
a~dverse to sobriety of *mind. The scenes
which pres~ent thems~elves, at· our entering
upon the world, are commpuly flattering-.
Whatever they be in themselves, the lively
·fpicrts. of the -young gild every: opening

Hence arise thero perils, of w~hic-h it is my
dcfign at present to warn them. I~ thall
take Jobriety of mind, in its most compre-
henfiv<' s~ense, asi including the wh-ole of
that discipline which religion and virtue
preferibe to youth. Though the words

a E R M. of the Text are direa~ly addre~fed ito young:

xt.f~ en, yet, as the furne admorution as given

in.a prec~dding verse to the - other sex,: the
i~ntrudtious which ar~ise frone the - xTex

I intend, firit, to show them -the impor-~
tance of beginning early to give~ serious
attention to their conduCdt; and, nexrt, to
point out those virtues which they o~ught
chiefly to cultrivate.

As fbon as you are capabl~e of reflee-

*right and a wro~ng, iix human adiotis.

You fee, that those· who are born with
the fame advantages of fortune, are· not
all eqlually prosperous in the c~ours~e of life.
While some of them, by wife and. Readye
condud~, attain diltin<5ion in the worlId,
and pass their days with comfort and ho-
nour; others of the fame rank, by mean
and vitious behavciour, forfeit the advan-
tages of their birth, involve ~h~etmfelves in
mu~ch misery, and tfnd in being a dif~-

it is not on the external condition in
which you find yours~elves placed, but on

to aat that part, what can be· of :greater

before you have yet committed. any fatal

quiriement of virtuous difjpoftions .and,

for every -charafter, and every dtation

alwrays paid to virtue. ITn the ~ufiial course
of human affairs, it will be found, that
a~ plain understanding joined with a~c-
knowvledg~ed w~orth, contributes more to
prosperit~y .than the brightest parts with-
out probity or honour. 'Whether f~ciene,
or business, or publick life, be ~your aim,
virtue fuill enters, :for a -principal share,
into all those great departments of so-

ciety.

SER M* ciety. It is connedted with eminence, ist

xI. every liberal art * with ~reputation, in

every branch of fair and us~eful business;
with diftination, in every publickz Rtation.
The vigour which it gives the mind, and
the weight which it adds to charad~er;
the generous sentiments which it breathes,

.the undaunted ipirit which it inspires,

thle ardour of diligence which it quickens,
the freed~om wmhich it procures from per--
nicious and dishonourable avocations, are
the foundations of all that is high in
fame, or great in s~uccess, among men.

Whatever ornamental or engaging en-

dowments you now poffefis, virtue is a
neceffapry requisite, in order to· their thin-

attra~tions of the fairest form, if it be
fuixpeded that nothing within, corre-
fponds to the pleasing appearance without.

s~upposed to be the vehicle of malice. By

, xt. ment of :this important period, as the

highest truss which shall ever he comm-
mittedd to -you; as, in a great meas~ure,
decifxve of your happiness, in time, and
:in eternity. As in the iAccef~on of the
fieafons, each, by the invariable laws of
Nature, affea2s the produAions of what1
is nexrt in cours~e; so, in human life, ev~ery
period of our age, according a@ it is well
or ill spent, influences the happines~s of
that which is to follow. Virtuous youth
gradually brings forward accomplished
and~ flourishing manhood; and fach mnan-
hood passes· of itself, without uneasines~s,
into refpecable and tranquil old age.
But when- nature is turned' out of its re;-
gular course, disorder takes place in the
moral, just aqs in the vegetable wvorld.~ If
the Springg put fort~h no blossoms, in
Sumsmer .there will be no· beauty, .and
in Autumn, no fruit. So, i y~out~h be
trified awyay withopt: improvement, man-
hood wilL be contempgtible, and old .age
m;Jiferiable, If the beginnings of life have

fbeen vanity, its lattir end can be no other SE M.a hl
than ·uexation of ipirit, xt.

Having thus shown t~he iaiportance of

beginning early to give s~erious attentioni
to condudt, I come, next, to point out the
virtues which are' nrot neceffairy to be
cultivated in youth, What I shall,

I. RECOMMEND, is piety to God. WVith

this I begin, both as the foundation ofE
good morals, and as a difpoiliton parti-
cularly 7graceful and becoming in youth.
'To be void of it, argues a cold heart, def~
t-itute of some of the best affe~tions which
belong to that age. Youth is the season
of warm and generous emotions. The
heart should then, s~pontaneously, rife
into the admiration ~of what is great,
glow with the love of what is fair and
excellent, and melt at the discovery of
tenderner~s and goodnes~s.~ Where can
any objeA be found so proper to kindle
those as fe £ions,, as the Father of the uni--
verse·, and the Author of all felicity ?

Wrhen, upon. rational and sober enquiry,
you have established your principles, s~us-
ser them not to be thlaken, by the ECcoffs
of th~elicentious, or the cavils of the fecep-
tical. REemember, that in the examina-
tion of every great and comprehensi~ve
plan, such as .that of Christianity, diffi-
culties mray be exped~ed to occur ; and
that reafonabgle evidence :is no~t to be r~e-
jeded, because the nature of our present
state allows us only to kndw in part, and

Impress

8 ER M. Impres~s your minds with reverence sos

X all that is sacred. Let no wantonners of;

youthful spirits, no compliance wyith the
intemiperate mirth of others, ever betray
you into fllies of profanity. Beflides the
.g~uilt which is thereby incurred, nothing
gives a more odilous appearance of petu-
lance and presumption to youth, than the
affedtation of treating religion with lev~i-
ty. Initead of being an evidence of f~ui
periour underi~anding, it betrays a pert
and shallow mind; which, vain of the
first finatterings of knowledge, presumes
to make light of what the reft of man-i
krind reverne.

At the fa~me time, you are not to imai

gine, that when exhorted to be religious,,
you are called upon, to become more for-
mnal and solemn in your manners than
others of the fame years, or to ered your-
~selves into fuxpercilious reprovers of those
around you. The ipirit of true religion
breathes gentlenefis and affktbility. ht
gives a native, unaffeded, ea~se to the ·be-
haviour. It is social, kind, and chieark

ful ;

ful-; far removed from that gloompy and SER M.,
illiberal f~uperf tition which clouds, ,th~e XJ.
'brow, iharpens the temper, dejeas the
spirit, and teaches men to fit thems~elves
for another world, by negledting the con-
cerns olf this. Let your religion, on the
contrary, conned~ preparation for heaven,
with an honourable dif~chargre of the du-
tries of adive life. ~Let it be associated in
your imagination, with all that is manly
and us~eful ; with wLohatfoever things .are
true, are jufJ, are pure, are laovely, are aof
good report, wherever there is an~y vrirtue,
and wherever there is anay praise. Of fich
religion dis~cover, on every proper occai
sion, that you are not afhanted; but avoid
mnaking~ any unnecefrary ost~entation of it
before the w-orld.

ty, ~reverence of your parents, and fiub-
miflion to thofei who are your fuperiours

charafters which you no~w admire, will,

shame. It degrades parts and learning;
obscures the luffr of every accomrplifh-
ment; and sinks you into contedipt with
~God, and man.

As ycqu value, therefore, the appro-

bation of Heaven, or the efleemn of the
world, cultivate the ·love of truth. In all
-your prtoceedings, be direc~t and consistent.

xt.f leads on to another * till, as the intricacy

of the labyrinth increafets, you are left
entang~led in your own iBare. Deceit difL
covers a little mind, which flops at tem-
porary expedients, without rising: to com-
prehenfve views of conduat. It betrays,
at: thme fame time, a dastardly fipirit. It is
the resource of one, who wants courage
tro a7vow hlis designs, or to refit upon him-
fTelf. Whereas, openness of charadfer dif~-
plays that generous boldness, which ought
to difinguifh youth. To f~etpt in the
wor-ld witlh no other principle than a
crafty attention to interelt, betokens one
who is deffined for creeping through the
infer'iour walks of life. But to give an
early preference to honour above gain,
when they fland in competit~ion; to de-
fpif~e every advantage, which cannot be
attained without dishonest arts - to;b~rook

IV. ~Yocan is th~e proper s~eason of

cultivating the benevolent, and humane
affeations. As a great part of your hap-
pinef~s is to depend on the comnedians
which you form with others, it is of high
i~mportance that you acquire, betimzes, the
tempe~r and the manners which will r~en-
dcer such conne~tions- comfortable. Let: a
sens~e of jufftice be the foundation of all
your faocial qualities. In your most early·

SER M. intercourse with ·the world, and even in

~fi~vyour youthful amus~ements, let: no unfair-

ness be .found. Engrave on your mind
that sacred rule, of doing in all things to
others, according as you wi/hF that they
Jh~ould do untoyoul. For this end, impres~s
yours~elves with a deep sense of the origi-
nal, and natural, eq~uality of men. What-
ever advantages of birth or fortune you
possess, never display them with an often*
tatious s~uperiority. - Leave the futbordi-r
nations of rank, to regulate the ilitercourfe
of more advanced years. At present, it
becomes you to aA among your comp>-
nions, as man with man. Remember how
unknown to you are the vicifltutdes of
the world ; and how often they, on whom
ignorant and contemptuous young men
once looked down -with s~corn, have risen
to be their fuperiours in future years.

Compafflon is an emotion, of which

you ought never to be ashamed. ·Grace-
ful ;in youth is the tear of s~ympathy, and
the heart that melts at the tale, of woe.
JLet not eafre and indulgence contrast y our

affe~tions ,

idffe~ions, and wrap you up in felfifh en- SE 11 1
joyment. But g;o s~ometimes to the house ~xl.t
ofmourning~, as well as to the hou/~e of'feaf~-
ing. Accuff~om yourfe~ilves to thinkr of the
<iffreffes of human life.; of the foblitary
cottage, the dying parent, and the weep-
ing orphan. Th~ou }halt not harden `thy~
heart, nor fult thy hand froma thypoor bro-
ther ; but thou fkalt surely give" unto him; in
the, day of his need : And thine heart J7 all
not be' grievled wPhenz thou g~ivref unto him ;
becaus~e that for this th5ing·, the Lord thy3 God
J7 all ble~f thee in all thy weorks *. Never
sport with pain and diffref~s, in any of
your amuf~iements ; nor treat even the
meanest inf~eA, with wanton cruelty.

In young minds, there is commonly a

firong propensity to particular intimacies
and friendships., Youth, indeed, is th~e
s~eason when friendships are fonetimes
formed, which not only continue througih
fuxcceeding life, but which glow to the
1aft, with a -tenderness unkrnowan to the
comnedians begun in cooler years. The
propensity therefore is not to bie difcou-

* Deut. xv. 7, r0. r e

and care. Too many of the pretended
friendships of youth, are mere comlbina-
tions in pleasure. They ar-e often found-
ed on capricious likings; futddenly con-
tradted, and as fixddenly di~ssolved. Some-
times they are the eff-edt of interested com-
plaifaLnce and flattery on the one fide, and
of credulous fondnefls on the other. Be-.
weare of such rash and dangerous connec-
tions, which may afterwards load you
with dishonour. Rem~ember, that by the
charadter of those whom you choof~ie for
your friends, your own is likely to be
formed, and will certainly be judged of
by the world. Be flow, therefore, and
cautious in contrading intimacy ; buit
when a virtuous friendship is once efta-
blifhed, confider it as a fagcred engagement.
Expose not yourselves· to the reproach of
lightner~s and inconstancy, which alwrays
bes~peak, either a trifling, ·or a basie mind.
Reveal none of the irecrets of your friend,
Be_ fai~thful to his interests. ForfaBke him

quiring any, advantage by his prejudice
-or hurt. There is a friend that lovecth at
all times, anzd a .brother that is hors f~or .ad

VI., Dxur-

·SER M. VI. DILIGENCE, induffry, and propet

XI improvement of time, are material duties

of the young. To no purpose are they
endowed with the best abilities, if they
want adtivity for exerting them. Un-
availing, in this caf~e, will be every direc-
tion that can be given them, either for
thieir temporal- or s~piritual welfare. In
youth, the habits of induffry are most
easily acquired. Iri youth, the incen-
tives to it are firongeft, fr-om ~ambition
and from duty, from emulation and
hope, from all the profpeas which the
beginning of life afibrds. If, dead to
there calls, you already languish in sloth-
ful inac'tion, what will be able to quicken
the more sluggish cur-rent of advancing-
years ?

Induffry is not only the infirument

of improvement, but the ~foundation of
pleasure. N~othing is to opposite to the
true enjoyment of life, as the relaxed
and feeble slate of an indolent mind.
He who is a stranger to indyffry, may
poffers, but he cannot enjoy. For it is

labour

labour only which gives the rel~ih' to SER M.
pleafuire. It is the appointed vehicle of~ ~xl.
every good to man. It is the indif~pen-
fibl~e condition of our poffefing~ a fCound
mind, in a found body. Sloth is so in-
consistent with both, that it is hard to
determine whether it be a greater foe to
v~irtue, or to hbealth and happines~s. In-
aative as it is in its~elf, its effeats are
fatally powerful. Though it appear a
slowly flowing fireamr, yet it undermines
all that is flable and flourishing. It not
only saps the foundation of every virtue,
but pours upon you a deluge of crimes
and evils. It is like w-ater which firit pu-
tr-ifies by stagnation; and then s~ends up
noxious vapours, and fills the atmos~phere
wvith death.

Fly, therefore, from idlenes~s, as the

certain parent both of guilt and of ruin..
And under idleaef~s I inc~lude,· not mere
inai~ion only, but all that circle of trifl-
ing occupations, in which too many
('aunter away their youth; perpetually
en3a~ged in frivolous faciety, or publick

amus~ements,

plifhnmenits, do. you hope to recommend
yours~elves to the thinking part of the
woirld,, andl to· answer .the expe~tations
of your friends, and your country ?--
Amusements, youth requires. It -were
vtain, it were c~ruel, to prohibit: them.
But though al~lowable ·as the relaxation,
they are. moR culpable as the business,
of the younga. Fo~r, ~they then become
the gulf of time, and the pois~on of the
mind. They foment bad· passions. They
wteaken the manly powers. TIhey fink
the ·native rigour of youth into con-
temptible effeminacy.

Red~eeming· your time from s~uch dan-

gerous waste, seek to fill it withem.~ployT-
ments · which you may review with faitif~
fa·Ction. The acquiifition of: knowledge,
is one of the most honourable occupa-
tions ·of youth. The desire of it disco-
vers a liberal mind, and is conne~ted with~

mCany~

rnlarly adcom~plifhments, ahlld many vrirrees. 8 E:R M.
But though your train of lifer ihould not U.~
lead you to· ftady, th~ c~ourse of ediucatilon
always furnifhles proper emrloyment~s to a
wvell-difpofed mind. Whlatever you pur-
fu,, be emulous to exrcell. Generous am~-
bition, anid feaibility to praiire, are, eirpe-
cially at: your age, among- the marks of
virtue. Think not, that: any affuence of
fortune, or any elevation of rank, exempt-s
you from the duties of application and
indufftry. Ind~uffry is the lawv of our
being; it is the demand of Niatture, of
Reason, and of God. R~emelmber always,
that the years which now pas~s over your
heads, leave permanent memnorials behind
9themn. F~romT your thoughtle~ss muinds th-ey
mlay escape; but they remlain in the re-
~membrance of God. They form an im-
portant part of the regiffer of your life;
They will hereafter bear tefim-r~ony, either
for ·or against you, at that day,. when, for
all your adlions, but particularly for the
employments of youth, you must give an

Of

8 ER M. Of t~hos~e which are incumlbent on

~J youth, I have treated in the preceeding

dis~cours~e. As we advance from youth to
mniddle age, a new field of adion opens,
and a different charadter is required. The
flow of gay and impetuous sp~irits, be-
gins to subside. Life gradually aflinnes a
graver cast; the mind, a more sedate and
thoughtfLId turn. The attention is now

. transferred from pleafuxre to interest:; that

is, to pleas~ure diffufed over a wider extent,
and meafurred by a larger scale.. Former-
ly, the enjoyment of the present moment
occupied the whole attention. Now, no
aation terminates ultimately in its~el~f, but
refers to some more difiant aim. Wrealth
and power, the infiruments of laftingr
·gratification, are now coveted more than
any single pleafurre. Prudence and fore-
fight lay their plans. Induffry carries on
its patient efforts. Adtivity pushes for-
ward; address winds around. Here, an
enemy is to be overcome; there, a rival
·to be displaced. Competitions warm; and
the firife of the world thickens oil every

fide,

fIde. To guide men through this bury· SE _RM,
period, without 10f~s of integrity; to guard Fs~
them against the temptations wh~ich aris~e
forom mlitaken, or interfering, intrerefts;
to recall them from worldly pursuits, to
f'erious though~ts of their spiritual con-
cerns, is th~e great office of religion.

But as this includes, in a great mea-

sure,· the wPhole compas~s of moral duty;
as the general firain of religious exhorta-
tion, is addressed to those who are in this
freafon of life; a delineation· of the vir-
tues, properly belonging to middle age,
may appear unnecefrary,, and would lead.
us i~nto too wide a field,. Let us thzerefore
turn our view to a b~ounded prof~pe £1·;
and contemplate a period~2 of life, the du-
ties of wh~ich are circumficribed w~ithin
narrower limits. Old age is a flage of
the human course, which e~very one hopes
to reach;. and therefore the consideration
of it, interests us all. I~t is a period juffly
entitled to general refpeft. Even its fanil-
ings ought to be touched with a gentle
hand; and though the petulant, and the

Occur ; yet, in fo~rmer yjears, either b~ufi-

y~oui both aiggravate the uneasiness of age,
and you alienate there on whose affedlion
much of y~our· com~fort depends. In order
to make the ~two( extremes of life unite
in amicab~le faciety, it is greatly to be
wifihed, that the young would look for-
~ward, and· confider that they ihall one
day ~be old; and tthat the old would look
back,· and remnembering that they once
wuere: young, make proper allowances for
the temper and the manners of youth.

But inficad of this, it is too common

to find the aged at declared elnmity with
the whole system of p~res~ent cuitom anid
mananers-; perpetually complaining of the
~growingdepravity of the world, .and· of
the affonifhing vices and follies of the
rising g-eneration. All things,~ according

difpleafurre, you may fairly inipute to the;
infirmit~y of age, which throws its· own
gloom on every fhrurounding objleA. Si-·

your youth, poured forth by your fathers;
and they who· are now young, shall, when
it comes to their turn, inveigh, in the

the world in every age. Sufficient ground
there is for the complaints made by f~eri-
ous ·observers·, at all times, of abounding
iniquity and folly. B~ut though particus
lar modes of vice prevail. in one· age, more
than in others, it does not follow, that
on that age all iniquity is accumulated.
I-t is the form, perhaps, more than the
quantity of. corruption, which maitkes the

the depravation of the world continued
to increase in prbportion to thos~e gloomy

past, have enimated each race as wvorfe
than the preceeding, by this time, not
one ray of good s~ens~e, nor one spark of

unextinguifhed among mankind.

One of the vices of old age, which ap-

pears the most unaccountable, is that co-
vetous attachment to worldly inte~reftr,
w~ith ~which it is often charged. But
this too, can naturally be deduced from
the s~ense of its feebleness and ·decay.

have you any just cause to complain, on xn.·
account of enduring what the conititution

to alter its established order ? Throughout
the whole vegetable, fienfible, and rational
world, whatever mnakes progres~s towards
maturity, as soon as it has passed that
point, begins to verge towards decay. It
is as natural for old age to be frail, as for
the corn to bend under the ripened ear,
or for the autumnal leaf to change its
hue. 'T-o this law, all w1ho went before

For, on all sides of human life, the baL-

apprehension concerning what: might be-

never untroubled. Your hopes were in-

It fihows us human· manners in their prii
m~itive simplicity, before t~he arts of re-
finement had polishe~d the behaviour, or
disguised the ~ch~araers of mie-n; w hen
Sth~ey gave vent to their patirons without

with that beautiful simplicity, ~which,. in
the highest degree, both delights the imra-
gination, and .afeats the heart.

Of all the patr~iarchal hiffories, that of

Jos~eph and his brethren is the most re-
markable, for~ the charadters of the adoirs,
the infirutivPe inature of the events, sind
the furpriiing revolutions of worldly fore

Seizing~ the opportunity· of his being at

him into a pit, and afterwards fold him

had thus gratified. their res~entment, they

Int rity, the operatient of conscience are of-

ten fuipended; and that advrerfity is the
s~eason w~thich refor~es them to t~heir pro-
per- force. At the time. when crimes are
comrmitted, the mind is too munch heat~ed
by paffon, and engrossed by the objea of
:its pursuit, to be capable of proper reflec-
tion. After this tumult: of [Cpiritrs has
fubfded, if a train of new pa~lions be at
Shand to employ its adtivity, or a Eurccef~
·sion of pleafucrable objeCs occur to en-
gage its attention, it may for a while re-
main, though not entirely free from in-
ward mnifgivings, yet unconscious of the
degree of its guilt. Diflipated among the
imuf~ements of Ilfe, the finner fc~apes, in
·some measure, from his own view. If he
refleas upon hims~elf at all, the continu-
ance of prof~petity Teem~s to him a firon~g
~justifi~cation of1 his condud~. For it will
be founrd, that in t~he hearts off all men,
there is a naturpl prop~enfty, to judge of
thre favour· of th~e.Supreme Being,. f-~om
rhe coirfe of externatl events. WJhen they

~are born with a fluooth gale along the sER l.
firam of life, and behold every thing 9
proceeding accordng, to their with,: har-d-
ly can they be brought to .believe, that
Prov~idence is their enemy. Bafkring in
the sun-shine of piroperity, they suppose
themse~lves to enjoyr the fmnile of indul-
gent: HFeaven; and fondly conclude, that
they are on terms of friendship, with all
above, and with all below. Easy; they
find it, then, to [pread over the grossest
crimes, a cover-ing·, thin, indeed, and
flighit, yet f~ufficient to conceal them fr-om
a su~perficial view.

O~f this we have a very remarkrable in-

fitance, in thofre brethren of JofCeph, whose
hiffory we now confider. Not only from
the silence of the inspired writer, we
have ground to believe thait their remnorfe
w~as fifi~ed, while their profperityr re-
maiined;· buit we are able to -trace .some
of the pretence~s by which, during that
period, they quieted their minds .. For
when they were contrivinig the deftruc-
tion of Joseph, we find Judah fiaying -to

aD Z his.

our hanzd be' upon him ; for he is our· bro-
ther~ and oukr fle/i : And his brethr-en zewere
content *. Here you behold them juffi-
fying their crime, by a fort of pretended
humanity ; and makting light of f~elling
their brother for a slave, becaus~e they did
not take away his life. How firangely
are the opinions of men altered, .by a
change in their condition ! How di~fferent
is this, f'etimnent of the Patriarchs, from
thiat` which~ they afterwards enterta-ined of
the fame a~tion, when, as you f~ee in the
Text, the remembrance of it wrung their
hrearts with anguilh ?

B3ut men,.in truth, differ as much. from

thems~elves,, in prosperity, and in adver-
fity, as if they were different creatures.
In profpierity, ev~ery thing tends ~to la/tter
and deceive~. In adversity, the illusions of
life· vanish. Its avocations, and its Iplea-
Thrres, no longer afford the finner that
fdhelter he was ,wont to find from -conf~ci.-

e~nce. Formerly, he made a part 'of the 8 ER M.
crowdl. He now feels hims~elf a. olitary runSf
'individual, left alone with God, and with
his own mind. H~is s~pirits are not fulpport-
ed,. as before, by fallacious views of the
favour of heaven. The candleof the Lord3
thines not on his head; his pride is hum-
bled; and his aff~eAions are softened, for
receiving, every f~eribus impreffon. ifn
this situation, a man's iniquity is sure to
fnzd himjl outCZ. Whatever has been notori-
ouly ·cr'iminafl in - his fEormer ~·i.condu a,,
rises as ae fpeafre, and~ places itfielif before

3 D2 Hence,

8 E R M. Hence, we may prceive the great us~e-

~cv~vfulnefqs, and propriety, of that inter-

,change of conditions, which takes place
in human Jlife. By proiperity, God gives
s~cope to , our pafflous, and ma~kes tr~ial .of
our dif~politions. B3y· adversity, he revives
the s~erious principle within. Neit~her the
--one, nor the osther, could be born entire

and unmixed. Man, always prosper,ous,
-would be giddy and ins~olent; always as-
flited·, woulld be s~ullen~ and despondent.
H~opes and fears, joy and sorrow, are,
therefore, so blended in his life, as both
t- o give room for wor1 1 qpurf~uits, and

,. to recall,, from time to. tim~, the admo-

nitions' of concieince. .. Of ,the proportion

And, from the vanity and raffmef~s of

(observe,

IV. THAIT ·when cons~cience is tho-

roughly awakened, it determines the
fiiner, to ·confider every calamity which
he iifuffers, as a positive infiiAion of ptx-
nilhmennt by Heaven. As it had before:
alarmed him with threatenings of' Di-
vine difiipleafurre, it: tells him, when he
f'alls .under difftrefs, that the threatened
-day of account is come. ~Af~ictions, ~on
fame occaffons, rife d~ireatly out of our
fins. Thus, dis~eases are brought on by
inttemperance ; poverty s~prings fr'oim
idlenes~s ; azid disgrace, from prefixmp-
tion. In' such cafes, the punishment is
to clos~ely· connaecd with the crime, that

(SER M- it is impofmble to avoid dif'cerning the

altrelation w~hich t~he one bear-s .to the

other. BuZ~t the appointment of Provi-
-dence, wvhich.we now confider, reaches
farther than this. God has framed ·us
so, that diffreffres, which have no per-
ceivable connedtion with our former
crimes, are, nevaerthelefs, interpreted by
cons~cience, to be inflidted on their ac-
count. Thiey fforce themselves upon our
-apprehenflon, .und~er this viewt. Theky are
made to carry, not only that degree of
pain which properly belongs to thnI~-
selves, but thati additional terment alib,
wNhich arises from the belief of their be-
ing the vengeance of the Almighty.

Let a man fall unexpededcly into some

deep calamnity. Let that calamity be
brought upon him, 'either by means
which the world calls fortuitous; or by
a train of incidents, in w~hich his own
mifcondudt, or guilt, has apparently had
no part; yet one of the first q~ueftion's,
which, in such a situation, he puts to
himfbelf, is, What have I done to dei-

serve

serve this ? His refleaion is, almost in- SER 14
findively, drawn back upon his former XLII.
life;. and if, in the course of that re-
trof~ped, any flagrant guilty deed occur:
to finite his· conscience, on this he can-
not avoid resting with anxiety and ter-
rour, and connedting it in his imagina-
tion with what he now f~uffers. He f~ees,
or thinks that he fees, a D~ivine arm lift-
ed up ; and what, in other circumitan-
ces, hie would have called a reverf'e of
fortune, he now views as a judgment
of Heaven.

When the brethren of Jos~eph, confined

in the Egyptian prison, were bewailing
the diffrers into which they had fallen,
there was no circumstance which pomnt-
ed out any relation between thteir present
misfortunie, and their former cruelty to
their br-other. A long· course of years had
intervened, during which they flourish-
ed in wvealth and ease. Thhey Oere now
far from the scene of their crime; in a
'foreign land, where they~ believed them-
selves utterly unknown, andi where they ·

had

SER M. had done nothing to offend. B~ut con-
Xm'. feiene formed a connedtion· between

events, w~hich, accord~ing to the ordi-
xary~ apprehension of men, we~re entire-
ly~ independent ·of each other. It made
them recoledt, that they, who once had
been d~eaf to th-e iipplicati~ons of· a bro-
tsher, were - owi left friendlefsj and for-
10rn, imploring, pityr in vain from an un-
r~elenti~ng Governour ; and that they who
had first confphired to kill their- brothier,
indi a~fterwrads f~old hi'm for a slave,
were thems~elves deprived of liberty, and
thrieatened w~t~h- an ignominious death.
How -indefer~vedly soever these evils be-
fell thers on the part of m-en, they con-
sessed them to be just on the part of
Providence. They concluded the hour of
retributEion to be arrived; and, in the
person of the Governour of ]Egypt, they
beheld the R~uler of the world calling
thekm to aiccount for guilt. Therefobre is
this diflre/ come u~pon uts. Behold also his
blood is required.

r iia

Iwill lbe founad -not u-ncommon amon IN
~mankind. Pious men,: there i~s no dboubt,
arle at all times difpef~ed to look up to~
God, and to acknowledgel his hand in
every event of life. But what I now
observe, is, That where no habitual ac-
knowledgment of God takes place; nay,
where a daring contempt of his autho-
rity has prevailed, -conscience, neverthe-
les~s, confi-rains men, in the day of their
diffrefs, to recogonize God, under the most
awful of .all charad~errs, The Avenger of
past ·guilt.

Hferein the wifdoml of God appears

in such a ligh~t, as justly to claim our
:highest admiration. The ordinary courfie
~of his Providence, is carried on by hut-
mnan means. He has fettled a train of
events, which proceed in a regular fuec-
cefilon of caus~es and effect, wpi~thout his
appearing to interpose, or to. ad.t B3ut
thefre, on proper oc~casions, are ,made to
affedt the human mind, in the farme
mranner as if he were ;be'held descend-

3 E ing

S I' M. ing from his throne, to. punish the finl

XSSZ ner, with his own hand. WMTere God to

suspend the laws of Nature,: on occasion
of every great crimp that was compmitted
on earth, and to govern the world by
frequent interpolitiops of a miraculous
kind, the whole order of human affairs
would be unhinged; no plans of alltion
could be formed; and no s~cope would
he given for the probation and trial of
men. On the other hand, were the o'pe-
ration of fCecond . caus~es allowed to con-
ceal a Divine hand totally from view, all
fienfei of fuperiour government: would be
loft; the world iwould fCeem .to be void

t~hat` awful view whily the Gospel gives
us, of the future cons~equences of guilt.
If~the.finner is now con~trained by con3

suing him with evil for long-forgotten
crimres, how naturally must he conclude,
that, in a subs~equent period of existence,
the Divine administration will proceed
upon the fame plan, and complete what
has been left imperfeAt here ? If, during·

the dis~pleas~ure of Providence at: fin is

may be apprehended to follow, when

Rejoice with5 tremnbling.

8 E M.O Y and Fear, are two great fpringri
gsvJ of human adion. The mixed con-

dition of this world, gives s~cope for
both; and, according, as the one or the
other predominates, it influences the gel
neral tenour of our conduii. Each of
them poffreffes a proper place in religion,
To ferlve the Lord *with gladne/s, is the
exhortation of the Psalmist David *, . To
felrve him with re~verence and g~odly fear,
is the- admonition of the Apostle Paul -f.
But, under the pre~e~nt imperfeaion of

iMay rbcomarried ·to .a. dangerouis extremne. xv
'When the whiole 4f relligton is placed in
joy, it is in hazard of rirlng into unwrar-
ranrtable rapture. When it rests altoge-
ther on fear, it degenerates into f~uperfti-
tious fiervility. The Text enjoins a due
raixture of both ; and inculcates this im-
portant maxim, That joy, tempered with
fear, is the proper disposition of a good
man. In dis~coursing of this fubje~t, I
shall endeavour to show, firit, That joy
is essential to religion; and next, That,
for various reasons, this joy ought to be~
mixed with fear; whence, we shall be
-able to ascertain the nature of that fleady
and composed ifpirit, which is most fulit-
able to our pz~efeat condition, and most
accept~able to God.

I. Joy is es fential to religion in t wo

refp~e1s ; as religion ins~pires joy, and
as it requires it. In other words; To
rejoice, is both the privilege, and the
duty, of good men.

that among the multitudes who devote
themselves to earthly pleasure, you will
not find a single person who has com~-

the condition of the high and the low,
of the gay and the f'erious, of the omen of

you th~all behold them all occupied, iri
supplying some want, or in removing
some diffrefs. No man is pleased wi~th

enjoys leis~ure, lang-uishes for want of
employment. In a single slate, we envy
the comforts of a family. In conjugal
life, we are chagrined with domneftick

'But under disappointments, when they & ER M.
occur,~ virtue' bears us up ; the iWorld al- xv.
10wps us to fink. W(hen the mind of a
good man is hurt by misfortunes, reli-
gion admainiff~ers thze cordial, and infuses
the balm. Whereas, the world infliats
w~ounds, and then leaves them to feffer.
It brings s~orrows, but it provides no con-
folation. Consolation is entirely the pro-
vince of religion. Supposing religion to
.be inferiour to vice in external advan-
t~ages, it must be allowed to poffers inter-
nal peace, in a much higher degree. This
is so certain, that almost all men, at some
period or other of their life, look forwcard.
to it, as to a'defirable retreat. When the
ends of their pref~ieat purs~uit shall be
accomplished, they propo~se to themselves
mnuch fatisfa(5ion in an honouratble dif-
charge o~f the duties of their itation,
amidst: thos~e moderate passions, and. tem-
perate pleasures, whichi innocence allbws.
Tha't which all men ·agree in holding~ to

It is the peculiar effed ·of virtue, to

make a man's chief happines~s aris~e from
himfielf, and his own condud5. A bad
man is wholly the creature of the world.
He hangs upon its favour, lives by its
fmniles, and is happy or miserable, in pro-
portion to his faccef~s. ~But: to a virtuous
man, ftuccefs in worldly undertakings is
but a s~eCondary obLjea. To dis~charge his
own part with integrity and honour, is
his chief aim. If he has done properly
wohat was incumbent on him to do, his
mind is at: reft; to Providence he leaves
the event. His wzitne~j is in heaven, and
his recor-d is on hzg-h. Satisfied with the
approbation of God, and the teffimony
of .a -good ·consc~ience, he enjoys himsel-f,
and des~pises the triumphs of guilt. In
proportion as fuc·Lh manly principles rule
your heart, yout will become independen't
of the world ; and, will forbear complain-

ing

ing of its dif·couragemrents. It is the im- SER M:
perfedion :of your virtue, which occasions xv.
you to be *wreary in zewell-doing·. It is be-
caufe.tour hiearts remain divrided between·
God and the world, that you are so often
discontented; partly wilhingto discharge
your duty, and partly seeking your happi-
ness from somewhat that is repugnant to
your du~ty. Study to be more confiltent in
principle, and more uniform in pradice,
and your peace will be more unbr~oken.

Though virtue may appear at frirt fight

to contra&t the bounds of enjoyment, you
will find, upon refle~ion, that, in truth,
it enlarges them. If it restrains the excess
of some pleasu~res, it; favours and increases
others. It precludes you from none, but
-such as are eithe-r fantaftic~k and ima-
ginary, or pernicious and, deftrudtive.
Whatever is truly valuable in human en-
joymentt, it allows to a good man, no less
than to others. It not only allows him
flich pleasures, but heightens them, by
that grateful relish which a good con-
feience gives to every .pleafiure. It not

only

st mr M. Only hreightens themn, but adds to themn

XV. also the peculiar ~atis~fadions which flow

Prom virtuous sentiments, from devout
affeations, and religious hopes. On how
much worse ~terms is the finner placed, in
the midst of his boasted gratifications ?
His portion is confined to this world.
His good things are all of one fort only;
hie has neither knowledge, nor relish, of
any thing beyond them. H~is enjoyment,
therefore, rdits on a much narrower basis,
than that of the servants of God. En-
large, as much as you pleas~e, the circle of
wmorldly gratifications ; yet, if nothing of
the mind and the heart, nothing of a re-
fined and moral nature, enter into that
circle, and vary the enjoyment, languor
and wearines~s soon succeed. Among
whomn do you hear more peevish expref-
fions of discontent, or more frequent
complaints of low s~pirits, than among the
profeffed votaries of worldly pleasu~re ?

Vice and virtue, in their progref~is, as

mn every other refpeda, hold an opposite
course The beginnings of vice are en-.

ticing.

ticing. The ·firfit fieps of wvorl~dly ad- 8 ER M.
vancement, are flattering and pleafinga. xv.r~
But: the continuance of fulccefs, blunts
enjoym~ent, and flattens desire. Wereleas,
the beginnings of virtue are laborious.
But, by per~e~verance its labours dimi-
nifh·, and its pleasures increase. As it:
ripens into confirmed habit, it becomes
b~oth fmnoother in prad~ice, andE more
comple~te in its reward. ,In a worlidly
life, the trerminatrion of our hopes always
meets our view. WMe f~ee a bourndary be-
fobre us, beyond whichr we cannot: reach.
But the profpeAs of virtue are growing,
Atnd· endless. The righteoucs }hall holdl on inz
h5is weay ; and he that hath cle~an hands,
}hall wax fronger· and fronzger. The path
of the jufk is as the shining hght, that
eJhineth more and more unto thGe perfec2 day.

ziw,~a take a view of the grounds on which 8 E RM.
it rests. By fixing our attention, both on xv.
the proofs wluch reason s~uggests, and on
'the dis~coveries which revelation has made,
of a Rtate of fu~ture retribution, we shall
take an effeAual method of confirming
our adherence to religion, and of baffling
those temptations which might lead us to
be weeary in weell-d~oing.

THE firit, and most obvious prefump-

tion, which reason affords in behalf of
futrre rewards to the righteous, arises
from the imperfedt diiaribution of good
and evil in our present slate. Notwith-
flanding what I have advanced concern-
ing the pleafiires and advantages of vir-
tue, it cannot be denied, that the happi-
~nes~s of good men is often left incomplete.
The vitious posses~s advantages, to which
they have no right; while the confieiin-
trious f~uffer for the fake of virtue, and
groan under diffreffes which they have
not merited from the world. Indeed,

admzit, that from such a slate of' things,.
no prefa~mption· would. arise, of any fu-
ture retribution being· inten-ded. They
wha delight to aggravate the mraiferies of
lifet,. andc the d-iffreffes· of virtue, do no·
service to· the argument: in behalf of Pro-
vidence. For, if total disorder be found:
to prevail now, fufpitcions may, too just-
ly, aris~e, of it~s prevailing for ever. If
he who:· rules the univerfec, entirely ne-
gle~ts virtue here, the probability muft~i
be sm-all, of his rewari~ding it hereafter,.
But' this is ~far fr'om being~ the true state.
of the fadL- WVhat human ~i~fe prefeats to·
the view· of an impartial obfierver, is by
no means a f~icene of entire confusion;
but a slate of order, begun, and carried
on a certain length. . Virtue· is so far
from being negle~ted: by the Governour
of t~he world, that .from many: evident:

them to their ifiTze. Man, fal~len fr~om

tat~e. D~ivine juffice remains, for a sea-

that their· chlaraders may be formed and
aficertained. Amidst dif~couragements and
affl~iiaias, the righteous give pr-oof ·of

Throulghout all ages, and among all

nations, the persuasion of a future life
has <prevailed. It fiprung not from the
refi~nem~ents of s~cience, or the [peculations
of philofop'hy; but f~rom a deeper and
fironger root, the natural iAntiments of
the human heart. H-ence it: is common
to the plhilofopher, and the savage; and
is found in th~e most barbaro~us, as well
as in thle most civilized regions. Ev~en
the belief of the b~einlg of a God:, is not
mI~ore general on the earth, than the be-
lief of imnmortality, D~ark indeed, and
confused., were. the notions· which men
entertained concerning a future itate.

gER M. Yet still, in that Rate, they looked for'
x3Tv. retribution, both to the good, and- the

bad; and in the perfeation of fo~ch plea-
fulres, as they krnew best, and valued
rnoft highly, they placed the; rewards of
.the virtuous. Slo universal a conf'ent
fCeems plainly to indicate, an original de-
termination given to the- foul by its Crte-
ator. It: shows this great truth, to be;
native and congenial to man.

When we looksf into our own breasts,

wme find various anticipations and pre-
s~ages of furture existence. Most of our
great and high paflions, extend beyond
the lijmits of thI~is life. The ambitious
and the felf-d~enied, the great, the good,
and the wicked, all take interest, in what
is to happen after they~ shall have left the
earth., That pailion for fame, which in-
spires- so much of the adivit~y of man-
kind, plainly is animated-by the perfu~ia-
sion, that conscious~nes~s is to s~urvive the
dissolution of the body. The virtuzous
are su~pported by the hope, the guilty·
tormented with the dread, .0f what is te~

.proaches, the hopes of the one, and the i
fears of the other, are found to redouble.
The foul, when ifihing hence, seems
more clearly to dis~cern its future abode.
All the operations of cons~cience, proceed
upon the belief of immortality. The
wrhole moral conduft of men refers to it.
All legislators have f~uppofied it. All re-
ligions are -built upon it. It is so essen-
tial to the order of society, that were it
erased, human laws would prove ineffec-
tual'reftraints from evil, and a deluge of
crimxes and miseries would overflow the
earth., To s~uppose~ this universal and.
pow~cerful belief to be wi~thout foundation
in truth, is to furppof~e, that a principle
ofdelufion was interwoven with the na-
ture ~of man ; is to fuxppofe, thnat his
·-Creator was reduced to the necessity of
· imprefirng his heart: with a falsehood, in
* order to make him answer the purposes
