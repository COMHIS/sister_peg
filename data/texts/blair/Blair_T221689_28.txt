Jos x. t.

My fo~ul is iweary of mtY ife.--

JOD, in thfir fl part of his days, was thre greaty?
of all thle ment of the Eaf . ]His potfef ions !wer~e large;
his family was numerous and flourithling;· his own
ccharafzter was fair and blam~eless. Yet: th~is mran it
p'leal-ed God to visit wyith extraordinary reverses of
fortulne. He was robbed of his whole f~bibtance.
H-is fans anid daughters all p~erifhled; and he himself,
fallen from- his high estate, childless ands reduced to
pover'ty, wa"s fitnten wiith fo0re dile~afe. H-is friendls
came about himn, seemingly writh the purpos~e of ad-
mliniffering comfort. But fromn a harth and ill-
foundedp conifcult~ion of the intention of Providence
in his disasters, they only added to his sorrows by
unrjuff upbraiding. Hence thos~e many pathetic la-
mentations with which this book abounds, poured
fCorth in the most beautifill and totiching arain of

voa.* Iv. B OrientdlI

Or~ientalpoetry. In one of thiofe: hours of lamentan-
tion, the· fentimnent in the t~ext w\as uIttered; My~4 Jful
·is wearyt of nylife ~'; a fe~ntime nt- , w·hich folrely, if any
situation canl jufftify it, w~as allow~able in the cafe
ofJob.

IN fitua~tionls ver·y different ~froml that: of Job, un-

der calamities fanr less; severe, it is not uncommnon to
finld fach a fentimnent working in the heart, and
fametimies breaking· forth fr~om the lips of men.
Many, very many there are, who on one occasion or
other·, have experienced this weariness~ of life, and
been tempted to withl that it would come to a close.
Leet us nowy exuamine in w~hat circumflance~s this f~eel-
ing may be deemed exculacble; in what: it is to be
held sinful; and under what reftriL~ions we may, on
anly occasion, be permitted to fay, My fou~l i- we~a~y
of my 1yfe.

I sentL confider the word~s 6~f the text in three

lights; as expressing, Sirs, The sentiment of a dif-
contented man; Secondly~, The f~eatiment of an as-
flided man; Thirdl~y, Thle sent~iment of a devout

man.

I. LET us confider the text as expressing the fen-

timent of a dif~olcnntetd man ; with whom it is the
effufion of i'pleen, ·vexation, and difaitisfadion with
life, ai-ifing from causes neither laudable nor juftifi-
able. There are chiefly three classes of men who are
liable to this difeaie of te~fe mind : the idle ; the luxu.
rious; the criminal..

,Firfi

F~i'fl, Turrs weariness of life is often foundI amnong

the idle.: persons comimonliy in easy circumfitances
of fortune, wrho are not engaged in any of the labo-
rious occupations of the wYortld, and wyho are, at thle
fame time, wTithoult energvy of mind to call them forth
into any othier line of a~cive exertion. In this .Ian-
guid, or rather torpid slate, they have To many vacant
hlours, anld are fo'mu~\ch at a loss howY to fIll up their·
time, that thecir sp~irits u~ttrly finrk; thiey become
burdensom~e to themelllves, andI to ever~y one arou nd
them; and drag writh pa"in the load of exiffence.
W~hat a convincing proof is hereby afforded, th~at
inlan wars decfignedt by hlis Cr~eator to be an acceive
being, w·chol~e happinefsj is to b~e found not mer·ely in
reft, but in occupation and purs~uit ? The idle are
doomed to fuffer the natural punifhlment of thieir in-
aEtivityV and folly; and for their comnplaints of the
tirefomten~efs of life t~here is no rem7edy but: to awakre
fr·om the dream of sloth, ~and. to fill up with proper
emaployment the mise~rable vacancies of their days.
.Let them fludy to becomle ufefull to the world, and
they thall soon becomne lelfs burthenfome to them-
selv·es. They shall begin 'to en~joyp exiffence; they
~thall reap the rewards wyhich Providence has annexed
to virtuous acdtivity ; and have no more cause to fCay,
Ml-Y foul is w~ar~y of m~Y i~Fe.

NWext, ~THE IUXLUtious and the di'ffipated for~m ano-

Thler class of men, among wrhom frich complaints are
flill more frequaent. With them they are not the
fruit of idletnefs. ~These~ are men who hazve been

Bsr bussed

busied enough; they hiave run the w~hole race- of
pleafilre; but they have r~un it writl filich inconfide-
rate fp~eedl, that it terminlates in wetarinefs and vexa-
tioni of spirit. BJy the Perpetual cours~e of dli~flpat~ion
in wthich they ar~e engarged; 'by th'e' excefltes which
they indulge; by thje riotous~lrevel,; andi the mlidnight:
or rathier morning hours" to '\vliich they prolong their
fefitivity; they have debilitated their bodies, and worn
out their sp~irits. Satiated with the repetition of their
accuffomed p~leafolres, and yet unable to find any
new ones in their place; wandering round and
round their former haunts of joy, and ever returning
difagppointed; wear~y of themselves, and of all things
about them, their s~pirits are oppressed with a deadly
g~loom7, and the complaint burits forth of odious lif~e
an~d a miserable world. Never are there complaints
more frequent than at the close of rounds of amule-
ment, and after a long repetition of felitl pleasu~res;
when the [pirits Which had been forced up, as by
some intoxicating drug, to an unnatural height, s~ub-
fide into profound dtejedion. What encreaifes the
evil is, that it is not among thle infirm and the aged,
but among the young, the gay, and the prosperous,
who ought to be reputed the happiest men, that this·
distaste of life most frequently prevai s.

fVMEN persons of this defeription, in their peevifhn

wiind splenetic hours, exclaim, My foul is weary of ryy
I~fe, let them know, let them be aiflired, that this is
no other than the judgment of God overtaking them
for their vices and fosllies. Their complaints of mi-

fCery

f'ery are entitled to no compassion; nay, they are
ifinfl, because they arise f·rom a fmlful cause ; fr~om
a minid broken and debafedt by luxur~y andi corrup~ti-
on. They are the authors of their owvn misery, by
having throwvn awavy on the follies of the world thoer
powers which God had beffowYed on them for nobl~er
ends. -Let them return to the duties of men and
Christians. . Let them retreat from11 friVOlity,' and
abitain from exce~ss. Let them study temperance,
m~oderation, and felf-command. B3y entering on a
virt~uous and manly cours~e of aLdion, and applyling
to the honourable dif~charlge of the fun~ions of their
itation, they will acqjuire different views. They
will obtain more real enljoyment of life, and become
more willinig to prolong it.-B--ut, after the warn-
ings wrhichi God has given them of their misb~ehaviour
b'y the inward mise~ry they fuaffer, if they flill continue
.to run thie famne intemperate round, and to drain
pleafire to the last: dregs, it th-all come to pals, that
they who now contema life, and are .impati~ent of
its continuance, th~all ~be the~perfons moss~ eage~r to
prolo~ng it. When they behold it in resility.drawing:
towards a close, and ar~e obliged to look forrwardc to
what· is to com~e ·after it, they~ , fall be rendered
awfully feptible of its value. They will thenl grasp
eagerly at the flying hours; anxious to flop tlhem if
t hey could, .and to employ every moment that remains
in repairing their past error~s, and . in making their
peace, if possible, with God and heaven. According
as they Zave/onon, they now reanp. They are reduced
to eat the fr-uit of t/;eir owmzn wys, .andl to be flt~le w·zitht
their· 'own devices.

alliiredly it is not uncommnon to hear the aflidled com-
plain that they are 'weary of life. Their comlplaints,

SOMETIM~s, the exclamation in the text may! be

occasioned by deep and overwhelmling grief. When
they whomn we hadl mrofe atffetionia tely loved; and in
whiomi e h~ad placect Ith felicity of our days, are
taken awa\vy, our c:onne~io nl with lif~e appears to be
dliflolved. "C Wkhy thouldl w~e furlvive thofc to whomr

" ge~r chee~rfidnefs~ invests the face of natulre. On
'' ever·y objed a i~th gloom appears t-o reft; and
': ever~y employmnclt of life is become an opprdflive
"'s burden." With thle feelings of those wvho are thus
diffr-effed we naturally ijympathile. They are f're-
quently thle Feelings of thle m~1ost virtuous and -amiable
mninds: Andt yet. fach persons muff be told, that
grief may be at I ge 1 so far as to become· immo-
derate and improper. T'here are bounds w~hichl are
preferibed to it both by reason and by religibnl. A
Christian ought not to mourn like dloJe so~o Iave up

RAs A ; it foml~etimes happens thant, apart ~fram

girief, grieat reverses of: worldly fortune give: rife to the
lamentation in the text., This w~as th~e cafe~ with Job
himself. A fixdden fall from opulence into inldigence
and wvant; some undeserved disgrace incurred, or
some unexpeated cloud thrown over former repu~tal-
tion and fame; the unkindness anid deser·tion of
friends, or the inso~lent triumph of enemies, are apt
to overwhelm the mlinds of men w)ith gloomi, and to
r·educe them to ~be wvear~y of life. To perfonIs under
such calamnities, fyrmpathyv is due.~ That fymlpathy,
however, will be pr~oportioned\ to the degree in whllich
wie confider themz as frece fromr blame in the mrisfor-
tunes which they fullfer. As far as, through their
own mifcondtua2 andt vice, they have b -en the aulthors
to t~hemse~lves of thlofe~ misfortunes, we withdraw ou~r
pity. The burthen whlich th~ey have brought on
themlfelves we leave thlem to bear as they can; and
with little concern we h~ear them exclaiml that thecir

ITr is goodl for persons in flich situations to remarkc

that, thoughi Job wYas for a lonig whille severely tried
by a variety of difftreffes, yet hiis condition wans not

to be found. TheyL~ are pe·Trfos wrho have nor parti-

LET' us beware of all furch imaginary refinemnents

as produlce a total difrelifhl of ounr p~rdent condtition1.
'Tnley are, for the most par~t, g~rafted either on difalp-
pointed( pu"rfits, or on a melancholy and splenetic
cast of minds. They are far fromn con~tributing to
happinels, and are inconsistent wirth all the attive
v~irtues of: man. This life defecrves not indeedt to be

.put in comp~etition with that blesse~d immortality to

TaUS I have placed before you, in various views,

the sentiment in the text ; and have thlewn in wha~t
·circum~itances, and fromn what caulets, t~hat difr~elifhl
of life arises which is of~ten foundt among manktind.
On a reviewv of the whole, we cannot but acknow-
ledge", that it is ~oftener to be arleribed to our own

S ERMO, II.

On CnARrTY as the End of the -COMMANDMENT,

r Tru~o~ar i. 5.

Ndow rthe end of' t~e conmmandment is charitjy outi of a pulre

bear·t, amli of a good con/cience, and· of faithl unfeigned.

IT appears from this chapter, that one design of the
Apostle, in writin: to Timothy, was to guard him
against certain corrup~ters of Chrifrian docarine, who
had already arisen in the c .ur~cii. To their sa!fe: re-
presentations of religion he op~poles that general view
of it which is given! in the r~ext. Such f~unmmaries of
religion frequently occur in the sacred writings ; and
are extremely ufieful. By the comprehensive energy
w~ith which they exprers the great lines of our duty,
they both imprint the (1 on our memory, and bring
them Ihomne to our cons~cience writha force. In the

progre~s`

prog'res of this discourse, I hope to~ make it appear,
that: the words of the text afford a most enlarged and
infirud~ive: view of religion in all its chief parts.

THE Apostle pronounces charity to be the -end

or scope o5f te comtmandment, that is, of the law of
God. At the fagme time, in order to prevent mif-
takes on this most important fubjea, he fubjoins to
charity certain adjunats, as neceffarly to .qualify it,
and to render the Christian chara~er ,complete,
T hefe are the pu~re ear~t, the good co~n/cince, and faith
munfeigned. In treating of there, I thall thew the na-
ture of their connexion with charity, and the impor-
tance of their being always united with it.

The end of the commadnmenPt is chrarity1. Charity is

thie f'ame with benevolence or love; and is the term
umiformly employed, in the N~ew Tefiament, to de-
note all the good affealtous which we ought to bear
towards one another. It consists not in speculative
ideas of general benevolence floating in th~e head, and
leaving the heart, as speculations too often "do, un-
touched and cold. Na~either is it confined to that
indolent good! nature, which makes it reft satisfied
wcith being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to
our fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of
s~ervice to any. True charity is an aative principle.
It is not pr~operly· a si-ngle virtue; but a difpolition
residing in the heart, as.a fountain whence all the vir-
tues of benignity, candoulr, forbearance, generosity,
comtpaffion, and liberality, flow, as to many native

itreams

fireamrs.. From genieral goodt will to all, it extendl s
its influlence particularly to those wvith wlhoml we fA;ndl
in neanreft conniecction, aIndl who are dir~elaly with~in
the sphere of our good oflices. F'romll the counltry
or commiunit y to whlichi we belong, it descends to
the fmanller associations of neighbourhood,, relations,
and fr~iends; and ij>reads itfelf' over the wvhole circle
of s~ocial and dlomieffic life., I mean not that it· im~-
ports a promifcuo us ~undifiniguilh~ing aIffeL~ion, whic~h
gives evrery manI anI eqlual title to our love. Chlarit~y,
if w\e thoauldl enIde:vo ulr to car~ry it so~ far·, wouldl be
rendered an impradicable virtule, and would resolve
itself into mere wyorls, w\ithout a~ffeaino thle hea~rt.
True charitry attemp~ts not to that our eyres to thle
diftinalon betwleen good anld bad men ; nor to wasrm
our hiearts equall~y to thiofe~ who befri·end and thiofe
who injure us. It reserves ourl efleeml for good men,
alnd our com~placenlcy ~for oulr frienrds. Towtards oiur
enemines it infp~ir~s forgivencfss and~ humanity. It
breathies universal candourr, and liberality of' senti-
mnent. It forms gentlenefis of temper, aind d~id~ates
affatbility of mannrers. It prompts corresponding
fymipatities ~with~ theml who rejoice- and-- them-- who'
weep'. It teaches us to flighlt and dei)>ife no man.
Charity is the comnforter of the affliaed, the protec-
tor of the oppresse~d, thec reconiciler of' dtifernces, thle
interceffocr f~or off~ender~s. It is fa~ith~fulnefs in the
fr~iend, public sp~irit in thle miagiffrate, equity, and
patience in the judge;, moderca tionl in1 the o'vereigni,
and loyalty in th'e fub~jeat. In parents it· is care and
attention; in1 children·1 it: is re:·erence and fu~bmiion.

.In1 a word, it is the foul of: facial life. It is the funi
that enlivens and ch~eers the abod~es of men. It is
I~ke :hie dlzo ~f Hermon, says thle Psalmist, andr the dlew
that dcendedkl ont ike~ mountanins of Zion, wher~e d~e Lor~d
~o/lwandt~ed sike ldg"ng, even? A~fefo· e'vermlorTe*A .

S unH charity, s~ays the text, is thre end of thre com-
a~n] ~Imentf. T~his assertion of the Ahpoitle is· undoubt·-

edlyf consonant to all that reason can ilggeit on the
fib~jeA of religion. For, on. considering the nature
of the Supreme Being, reason gives us much ground
to believe, that the chief design of all the' command-
ments which he has given to men, is to promote their
happ'ineijs. Independent and felf-fufficient, th~at
Supreme Being has nothing to exaA fr~om us for his
owYn interest or felicity. By our services he cannot
be b~enefited, nor by our offences injured. WIhen
he created the world, it was benevolence that moved
hliml to confer exifrence. Wi~hen he made himself
knowvn to his creatures, benevolence in like manner
mnoved. him to give them laws for· their conduat.
Bnelnvolence is the sp~ring of legitlation in the Deity,
as munch as it was the mnotive of creation.. HEe iff'ued
hlis commands on earth on purpof~e.that by obedlience
to them, his creatur~es mighth .be render~ed happy
amon~g themf'elves in this life, and be prepat~red for
greater happines~s in another. Charity,. especially
·vhe n joined ivith purity, goodI conscience, and faith,
is ob~viously the great infiru~ment. for this purpose;
and! therefore muff nleeds p~offetfs the chief and primary:
place in the laws of God.

be r~ealfiedi, in orrder that· religion mray be hieldl forthi
to the ~worldl in its complete fo~lrm, anld in its full and
undimiinifhed luff~re.

THE first qualification of chiarity pointed out in

the texut is purity ; char~ityout of a ourle hreart. Purity
includes the virtues which belong: to the individual,
considered in himself, and with. refpeAt to the govern-
ment of his desires and plearlires. It hath its feat in
the heart ; but extenids its influence over to much of
the outward condult, as to form a great andi material
part of the chara~ter. They are only the pure in lheart
wve are told by our Saviour, Irulo can fee God*-'f. It is
also true, that they are only the pure in bear~t who can
prop~erly dilcharge their duties towards mankind.
Inordinlate love of pleasure, intempera~nce, fenfuali-
ty, andl a course of irregullar life, are inconsistent,

not

a Matth. v. 8.

not only with the general charamer of a good ma~n,
but also with the peculiar exerciles of cha~rity andi
b~enevolenice. For nothing is mnore certain,, than that
hanbits of licentious ind~ulgence conitribute to fl~ifle all
the good affeations ; to harden the heart; to nourithl
that felfifh attachment to our own vicious pleafuires
which renders us insensible to the circumfftancess and
wants of others. A profligate man is feeldom fountd
to be a good hufbannd, a good father, or a beneficent
neighbour. H~oly mnly young perfolns have at firit
set out in the wrorld with ex~cellent difpoitions of
heart ; generous, charitable, and humane; kinid to
their friends, and amiable among all with whom they
had intercourse? And yet howv oft~en have we seen
all those: fair appearances unhappily bla~ted in the
progres~s of life, m~erely through the influence of 100fe
and corrupting p~leafolres; andl those ver~y persons
w\iho promised once to be bleilings to thle wrorld, funkll
dow~n, in the end, to be the burthlen and 12ifa~ince of
faociety The .profusion of expence which their
pleasures occaflon,' accounts inl a gr·eat mneafulre for
the fatal reverse that takes place in their chara~er..
It not only drains thle sources w~hence the fireams. of
beneficence thlould flowr, but of'ten obliges them to
become.0Ipprefi~ve and cruel to thiofe whiom it ~was
their durty to have patr~onised and fulpportedi.

PUKrry of heart and condua~ mufft therefore .be

hetld fundlamentalto chrarity andl love, as well as to
general piety and virtue. "T'he licentious, I .know,
are ready to imagine. that thecir occallonal deedls of

bounty and Liberality w~ill atone for many of their
pr·ivate disorders. BZut, befidtes that flich planls of
compenf"iatio n for vices, by foml~e fiippofed virtues,
are ah~vays .fanllaciou~s, the licenltious miay be afiixed,
thiat it is an appearanlce only of charity, not thle
r~eality of it, to wvhich they canl lay .claim. For· that
great virtue consists not: in occalionlal a~ions of huI-
maniity, inl fits .of kindners or compassion, to which
bad men may be prom~pted by natural *infina;~t but
inl the ficad(y andc regular exercis~e of those good affec-
tionls, andc th~e dis~charge of those important duties
towvards others, for wlhich the licentious are in a great
m~ealitre difqlualifiedl. Their criininal propensities
dires·t their inclinlations to verIy different: objeas anld
p~urfirits; an~d often dieterminec· them to sacrifice the
juff rights of others, fomiet-imes to sa~crifice the peace
anid the rep~utation of the innocent, to the gS~atifica-
tioni of their pai'ons. Suchi is the pernicious influ-
ence whtlich the love of pleafulre has on the good qua-
lities o~f its devoted votaries. T'he impur~e heart is
like thie stagnant: and putrifying lake, which sends
forth its poifConous exhalat~ionls to corrupt and wither
every plant that grows onl its banks.

THE second qualification annexed ~to Charity, in

thle text, is, that it: be of agood c~onfcien.tce. B1y this I
underitand the Apoitle to mean, that charity be in
filll consistency with juffice. and integrity; that the
cons~cience of the mnan who purp~oses to perform a~t~ionls
of benevolence, be free from the reproach of having
negledted the primary duties of equity, For, uzn-

(Economy, w~hen~ prudently and tempe~rately con-
duaeftd, is the farfeguard of mlany virtues; and ·is in
a particular mannler fanvourable to the exertions of be-
nevolence. He who by inconfiderante condluA is
hiijuring his circumstances, will pr·obably in time
lose the inclination, and certainly is depr~ivilng him-
flelf of the means of being serviceable to his brethren.
Some important exertions, indeed, there are of ccha-
rity, w~ihich hav~e no con~ned~ion with giv~iing or be-

B3ut prad~ice not f'oundecd onl prinlcip~le is likely to

cut afulnder byv an invisible hiand, whtlich is firetchled
forthl ovrer all the inh~abitanits of the w\orld. Then
naturally aris~es tle: e~jaculatio n~ of the 'text, .lilly times,
O Godc,,u aein thyI balj. "C M1Y fate dependl s on thlee.
"t T~dhe durationi of~ mly li~f, anid all the events whtichl
" in future day·s are to fill it, are entirely at thy dif~-
" pofal."'--Let us nowv, whien \ve have juff seen
one year close·, and another b~egin, meditate s~eriously
oni thiis fentimlent. Let us confider w·hat is implied
in our rtimeLs beingj inL th hndIof Godl; and to w\hat im-
provemuent this mieditartion leads.

THEI text CVidently implies, first, that our· timres

are not in our ownl· hland; that, as ouir continuance
in life depenlds not on ourselves, so the evenlts which
aire to happen, while life remains, are unknown to
us, and niot under our ow~n direcionl. Of this we
mnay behold m~any a proof, when we look back on
the tranfadtions of the year which is jufl[ finiflhed.
Recolledion will readily pref~eat to us a busy period,
filled up wlith a mixture of business and amulement,
of anxieties an~d cares, of joys and sorrows. We
have talked, perhaps, andt alded much. We h~ave for~med

m~any

m~any a p'lan; in p~ublic or inl prlivate life, wye have
been engaged in an variety of p~urfiiits. :Let mec now
ailk, how fmnall a p~roplortionl of all thiat hias happe~ned
c~ould ha;ve been foreseen, or fo~retoldl by us ? H-ow
nuinly things haive occurredl , of whici w'e had· no
excslcatio n;; some, perhap~s, thiat have fiiccrteede
becyondt our hopecs; many, also, thait hanve befallen
uls con~trary to our withl. ? How oftenl werle each of
us admnonifhedt thiat there are secret wheels, whlichl
unfTeen by us, bring about the revolutionis - f human
affairs; and that, whiile man was deviling hiis way,
P'rovidence was diredinlg the evenlt ?

THrr feene is now closed. T~ehe tal9e of: thiat

year has been told. We look forwardl to thle year
which is beginning; and what: do wIe behold thecre ?
-All1, my brethren, is a b~lank to our view: A dtark
unknown p~resents itself., We are entering on an
uIntried, lndlifcoveredl country, where, as each fulc-
cceeding month comes forward, new scenes may
.ope"; new ob~jeas may engage our attention;
channges at hqme or abroadl, in purblic or in private
af~fa~is, may alter the whole slate of our foitrtune.
]New conneations may be at hiand to be formied, or
old ones juff about to be dliffolvedl; perhaps, we maiy
have little more to do with- thiis wvorld, or withl aniy
of its cornneaions; we may be flandling on~ the verge
of time and Ilife, anld on thc p~oint of pafing inito a
new\ region of exiflenlce. In thocrt, the profp~edt
bef'ore us is full of awfu~l uncertainty. L.ife and
death, prosperity and adiverfity, hea~lth and ficknlers

are to look up to alln afull and irresist~ible Providence,
itretching its arm over our heads ; dire~ing thle fate
of men, and diff~enring at its p~leathnre happiness or
mnifery. In the giddty mlomentss of jollity, the wan-
tolln an thoughltlefis are ap't to fly : "( Let·2 uJ ca andl

--Be aflilired, mly brethren, it is not so. You great-
ly deceiveyourfelves, by imafgining that your C'reator
andc GZovernor is indlifferent to the part you are now
aL~ing ; or that the diffribution of good and evil,
w\hich nlow taktes place, has no relation to your mo-·

tue has, in all ages, been reprefillnted~ as placedl onl
thle liinumllit of a hlill; in thle asc~ent of wh~ich labour
is requ~isite, andc difticu\lties ar~e to be filnrmoun~ted ;
and where a condudo~r is necedei,· to dlired our way,
~ad to arid ourP fieps.

Niowt, the hiope whiic~h good men entertain is,

that this path of life tha1Iltl be tewn them by G~od ;
that, whien their intenitions are sup~right, G;od will
both infiruab themn colcernlingg thle roadt which leadls
to true happ~iness, andt will alift themr to paurtiie it
fiiicefrsfully. Among nations where anly liiitable
ideas of God or of virtue began to be form~ed, hiopes
of this nature also bega~n to be entertainedf. It wras
confoinant to the anturle of mnan, to thlinki thnt the
Supreme" Being w!as favourable to virtue. Accordt-
ingly, in the· wriitings of fomea of thle ancienit philo-
fophlers, wre find variouls obficulre traces of th~is belief,
that there was a b~enign hea~venlly sp~irit, wrho illumi-
natedl the minds of ~the virtuous, andc' assisted thieir
endleavours to obtain wifdlom and hap~piness. They
even asserted, that no man becamne great or good
wpithout fomlle infpiraltionl ofheaven1.

Bwr what they indil~inatly conceived, and could

not,with confidence rely upon, the doi~rine of Chris~-
tianity hath clearly exp~lained and fullly confirmed;
exprefrsly and frequently teaching, that not only by
.be external dikiovecries of revela~tion, but by thle ini-

Wlardt

war~d ope"rations of hiis Sp~irit, be form~J to the h~umb'le
andc virtuous the path ~ o~f 1/:. While, by hiis word,
he infiru~As themi ini thecir dunty, by the influence of
hiis gra~ce he alif~ts themi in thre performance of it.
in anll revelation thcr'e is certainly nio doatrinle more
comnfortable than this. It is to good men, a noble
andi pleasing thoughht, that they are pursu~ing a path
which God has dlilcoveredl and poinlted out to them.
For they know that every path, in which he is their
condtudor, mluft be honourable, muff be safe, muff
brring them in the enld to felicity. They follow that
Sheph~'-Er of Ifiael, who always leads his flock into
gr~teeln paure, andl makes detm lie dlowno byile thre flill
watersr. At the fame time, they know that, if there
be truth in religion at all, on this principle they nmay
securely reft, that the Divine Being will never des~ert
those who are endleavourinlg to follow out, as they
can, the path which he has thlewn them. HeIc be-
holdls them here inl a slate of great imbeciity; fir-
rounded with muchi darknels; expos-ed to numb~er-
less danlgers, from the tempitationls that assault thlem

ever fuf1pedt that thle Father of mercies will leave his
servants, alone andi unbefriended, to fitruggle up the
hill of virtue, without firetching forth a comp;.aflion-

THE SE words occurred in a conference wrhich

our YLord held wIithl Simon lPetel*, after h~is refulrrec-

F 2 tion

tioni from the dead. Confc ious of thle diilgrace whichl
hec had~ inlcu~rred by hiis late deniial of his Mafnter,, Petter
miuit at: this timne have appIeared before him·1 withz
;thamne. O~ur L~ord, af~ter· a tacit recbuk~e, impllied in
the question whlichl hle repeatedly puts to hlim, SimNon,
Jonr offo~nas, lo~ves thou me·? r~eflores him, w\ithl grleat
benigniity, to his office as anl apofile, by giving the
commndn~menlt to Jfced his //'tee; and intim~ates also
that~t it thlould be hris lot. to fuffer dea~th inl the caus~e
of hiis M~aiter. Thie Ap~oille Johnl, difinilguifhled
hlere by the deno~minationl of the di/2-!le whom~~ fe/his
loved·r, being present at this converfantion, Peter, w~ho
wvas alwvays eager and forw~ard, looking to John, puts
this question to our Salviour, Lord,~ and whtulcaJ~ ll this
malnt do ? " What shall be his emnploymnent ? w\hat
C' his rank andi flation in thy k~ingdom ? what his
L fitltue ~fate inl life ?"-Bly what prin~ciple P'eter
wvas moved to p~ut this unfed~io nabll e andl improper
quefion to his M/aster; w·hether it arose~ fr~om mere
curiosity, or from s~ome emotion of rivalfhip andi
jealousy, does not appear; but it is plain that: ouLr
Lord was dith~tisfied wvith the enquiry whicht he
mnade; andt prese~ntly hre checks Pecter's curiosity, by
a severe reply ; Whatlm is tha~t to thlee B "C Wthat is it to
"' thee what thris martJJn fl dob; wlhat thlall be his rank;
"t or wahat the circumnitances of his lif~e or his
"' deathz ? Ateexd, thou to thine owPn dutyv. Mlind
" thy proper· concerns. -Fulfil the part which I
r' have allotted to thee. IFoII'L ~ll thoum."--The in-
firuction wvhich airies from this conversation of our
Lord's withi Peter:, is, That all pryingo inquiries into

the

thle flEate, circumitances, or chlara~er of others, are
repre"henfble and improper; that to evlery manl a
par"ticular char~ge is ali~gned by his Lord and Maiter,
the fuilfillment of which ougfht to be the p~rimary
ob~jea~ of his attention, without officioufly thr-uff~ing
himfelkf into thle concerns of others. The illuficati-
onl of there3 p~oinlts thlcll make the flibeAt of the pre-
feat: difcourfec.

THA o idle curiosity, that inquilitive and meddling

[pirit, which leads men to pry into the affairs of their
neighbours, is reprehensible on three accounts. It
interrupts the good order, ands breaks the peace of
society. It brings forwvard and nourihess several
bad pafflons. It dr~aws mlen aside from a proper at·-
tention to thle dik~harg~e of their own duty.

ITr interrupts, I fay, the order, andi breaks thle

peace of faciety. In this world wre are linked toge-
ther by many ties. We are bound by duty, and wve
are promptedt by interest, to give mutual af~filance,
and to perfor~m friendly offices to each other. But
those friendly offices are performed to most advanl-
ta~ge, whlen wve avoid to interferle unnecessarily in the
concerns of our neighboutr. Eivery man has his
owvn part to act~, has his owni interest to confuilt, has
affairs of his own to manage, wvhich his neighbour
hans no call to scrutinize. Humallnn life thenr proceedts
inl its most natural and ordferly train, whenn every
one keeps within the bounds of' his proper provine;

wvhen

whlen, as long as his purs~uits are fair and lawful, he
is allowredl, wtithout diflurbance, to conduat them in
6is own way. Tlrat yE Jud to be uiet, and to do your
owrn b~ryne/s*,1· is thle apoffolical rule, and indeed the
great rule, for pres~ervation of harmony and order.
But so it is, that, in every age, a s~et of men have
esiited, who, driven by an unhappy adtivity of ipi-
rit, oftener perhaps than by any fettled design of
dioinga ill, or any motives of ambition or interest,
love to intermeddle where they have no concern, to
inquire into the private affairs of others, and from
the imperfedt information which they colledt, to
f~orm conclusions concerning ·their circumfiances
and chara~ter. These are they us~ho, in scripture,
are charad~erifetd as tatlelrs, and bu/~y bodi~es int othrer
mens mratters~, and f·rom whom we are called to turn'i

THOUGH persons of this defeription thlould be

prompted by nothing but vain curiosity, they are,
never~theless, dangerous troublers of the world.
W7hile they conceive themselves to be inoffenfive,
they are sowing dissension and feuds. Crossing the
lines in which others move, they create confusion,
and awaken resentment. For every man conceives.

bled him. Hence, many a friendship has been
broken; the: peace of many a family has been over-
thrown; and much bitter and lasting discord has been
propagated through society.

WTHILE this piriit of meddling curiosit-y injures so

considerably the peace and good order of the world,
it also nourishes, among individuals who are ad-
dided to it, a multiturde of bad passions. Its m~ost
frequent source is mere idleness, which, in its~elf a
vice, never fails to engeinder many vices more. The
mind of man cannot be long without some food to
nourinh the a~ivity of its thoughts. The idle, who
have no nourishment of this fort within themselves,
feed their thoughts with inquiries into the conduA
of their neighbours. The inquisitive and curious
are always talkative. What they learn, or fancy
themfielves to have learned, concerning other~s, they
are generally in halle to divulge. A tale which the
malicious have invented, and thle credulous have
propagated; a rumour which, arising among the
multitude, andi tranfmnitted by one to another, has,
in every flep of its progress, gained freth additions,
becom~es in the end the foundation of confident as-
fertionl, and of rash and severe judgemen~t.

IT is often by- a spirit of jealoufyr and rivral·ry,

that: the researches of fiich persons are prompted.

slurs; but this p~rying and mieddfling spirit feecks to

IN thle great circle of humian affalirs there is room

for evler~y one to be b~usy andi well employed in his`

others. It is thle pr1ovince of fulperio~rs to direat; of
inferior~s to obey ; of thle learnedi to be infirud~ive;
of: thle ignlorantt to be docile; of the old to be com-
municative; of the young to be advileable and di-

indluffrious, peaceable and contented. Art thou.

If thou livelt private and retired, it: is thy bufinefTs

canst do no more, one faithaful falbjeA to thle Mef~-

THERE IS, in1 particular, one great and compre-

henfive objeA of attention, which, in the text, is
placed in dire&t opposition to thiat idle cuiriofity re-
prehendied by our Lord; that is, to follow Christ-.
Follow thou me. What this mian or that m~an does;
how he employs his time ; what use hie makes of his
talents; hlowY he filceedls in the world; are m~atters,
concerninlg which the information we receive can
nevler be of great: importance to us; often, is of no
importance at all. But how ouir Saviour behaved
while he was on earth, or hiow, in our situation, he
would have behaved, are matters of the h~ighleft mo-
ment to every Chriftiani.

THE COmmandment given in the text, to followo

Irim, includes both obs~ervance of his words, aund
imitation of his example. The words of Christ con-
tain, -as wye all know, the flanding rule of our life.
His example exhibits the great model on which our
conduat ought to be fomedl; and it is to this thiat the
precept here deliveredt direcaly refers.--Examples
have great influence on all. But by all human ex-
aImples, we are in danger of beinig occasionally mif'
led. W~e are ever obliged to be on our' guard, left
the admiration of what is effimable, betray us into
a resemblance of what is blemlifhned andI faurlty. For
the most~ perfedt human charadners, in the midst of
their brightness and beauty, are always markred with
some of t~hos~e darkr spots which slain the nature of
manl. But our Lord poffeffed all the virtues of the
greatest and best men, without partaking any of

their

theuir defaccs. I ialwslgtwtotatoe
and beanuty wvithout a ithrin.-Ar t thle famen timec, his
examp!e is attendledt wl:th thijs singu(lar advanta;ge, of

THESE words of our Lord were occalloned
by a circumflance in his behaviour wshich apprearedi
myfierious to his discip~les. When about to cele-
brate his last` passover, he meant to give them an
infirudive lesson of condefention and humility.
The mode wvhich~ he chose for delivering: this in-~
firuation, was the emblematical a~ion o' wIathing
thecir feet. W~hen Simnon Peter saw his mrafter ad-
dredirng himself to the performance of so menlial an
office, he exclaims with thle greatest fiioprifre, Lordl,
dloJi throu ·rva/3 my feetr ? Ourr L~ordl replies, in the words
of the text,WhatrIdioth·ou knotoycJ not now, butthiou

This is the dot9.rine whlich I: purpose to iulluffrte inl

I. Ova Saviour's words lead us to obse~rve, thlat

many things in the condtua of Providenice are at
present myfierious and unintelligible. Thie truthz
of thiis obse~rvation wtill not be calledl inl question.
I~t is indeed very rea~dily admlitted by all ; andi ever
since the beg~inninlg of~ thle world hans been thle founi-
dation of many a comiplainlt, and of mulchh ceept~icifmn
concernmo1 the <rovs lernment of hieaven.- Thrat hu-
man althirs are not Ilef to roll on accordin~g to mer~e
chance, and tha~t Prolvidence interposes in themn to
a cer~tain degnree, is m1-ade evident by v~r~ious toktens
to every candid mnind. Buit thle perp~lexityy and trou-
ble: of thle thoulghtfull inqcuirer arifets from obilerving

that:

that Pr1ovidentce appears noat to purfui~e any r·egular
or consistent p~lan. An unaccountable mixture of
light andt dlarknefs prefenits itself to us, when wve
attemnpt to trace the affa~irs of the worldl up to any
wife andc righteous adminifframtion. We f~ee juffice
and order begun ; but on man~y occasions they seem
to be defeTrted. T'he ray of light w~hich we had
tracedl for a whiile, fudtdenly forlakes us; and, wyhere
we hfad lookedl for the conitinuance of ordecr, we meet
wvith confulfion and difac~ppoinltm~ent.-For~ inflance;
whleni we examine the conflitution of t~he hum~an
mlind, wte dikecrn evident marks of it~s being framed
with a view to falvour and~ reward virtue. Confci-
ence is endowed with signal auithority to check vice.
It brings hlome uneasiness and remnorfe to thle badl;
and it foothbs and flipports the righteous with self-
appr·obation andt peace. The ordtinary courfel of
hu~man things is made to coincidle in some dlegree
withl this confltitutioni of our niature. The worthy
and the good are, in general, honouredl and effeem-
ed. He that realkckur Clll'~IlY, is, fo)r the mnoft part,
fsoun~d to scanlk fa~ely. 'The chiecf mlisfortunes that
belid uLs in life canl bec traced~ to som~e vices or foillies

w\orld, how many f;eenes do wve behlold, whli~ch ar~e
far fromn correfpti~ondig withl any ideas wle cou~ldl

of the eairth wLe fee lyinig in a slate of barbarity anid
mlifery ; fim~k in folch gross ignor·ance as degr~ades
them below the rank of rational beings ; or abandon-
ed to be the prey of cruel oppr~efion and tyrannly.
WMhen we look to the flaite of individuals around us,
we hear the lamentations of the unhapp~y on every
hand. WVe meet with weeping pareltss and mourn-

flower of their days, and1 thle aged left deso~late· in the
midst of ~Sorrows. Th~re useful anld virtuous arer
swept away, and the worthless lef't to flourith. The
lives of the best men are often fi11ed with dis~courage-
ments and diifappointed hopes. MIerit languifhies in
negle~ted fol~itudle; and vanity and prefuimption gain
the admiration of the wortldl. From th~e scourge of
calumnny, and fromn th~e hand of violence, the in-
jured look up to God as thec Avenger of their cause;
but often they lo~ok up in vain. H-e is a G~odi C/at

who would indlulge one faivourite piallionl, to deny

made, preferen"ces be given, andl some general re-
gula~tion of conduat be observed, by every one who

on thle mindl prinicip~les of n~oble independlence. rThe

111. ANOTHER chtftief Of t IC slavery Of VICez,

is that mean, cowanrdly, and dlifquieted ilate, to-
whlichi it redluces thle finnler. Bokrinefs awil. magnairi-
m~ity have eve~r been accounted the nlative effeffs of:
liberty. Hle who enijoys it, having nothing to ap-
pr'ehend fr~om oppr~ellive powerct, perf~ormls the otlices,
andi enjoys the comlforts of life, wvith a mnlytl~ and
undiflurbed mind. Hence hiis be~haviour is d!igni-
fled, and his sentiments are honoura~ble; wh~ile he
wlho is accuff~omed to bends undery s~ervile fabjed~iont,

has

has alwayv s been found menlc- sp~irited, timorous a~nd
b~nfe.--Co mpare, in thiefe refpea~s, thle virtuous and
thle vicious man, andi you will ealily fee to which of
thecm thle chiaradteriflics of frieedom most juffly be-
long. T~he man of virtue, relying on a good con-~
science and the proteaion of Heavenr, ac~s withr
firnmefrs and courage; and in the difchiarge of hiis
dluty, fears niot the face of man. The manl of vice,
confrcious of his low and corrupt aimas, thlrinks be-
fore the fle~dfait andi piercing eye of inltegrity; is ever
looking around him with anxious and fearfl circumn-
[p~eaion, and thlinking of fizbterfuges, by wyhich hie
mlay es~cape from danger. The one is bold as a lion,
thle other ~fillie whncl nto mlanL putywitht. To the one,
nothing appears contemptible, by which he canl pr~o-
cure anly present advantagre. T~he other lookrs with
dlifdain on whatever would degrade his charnaer*
"C I will not," says hie, "L so diemean myself, as to
" catch the f~avour of the greatest man, by this or
'" that: low arte. It thlall no~t be falid or thought of me,
" that IL did what was base in order to make my for-
"L tulne. Let others sloop so low, who cannrot be:
"C wit~hout the fazvours of the world. But I canl want
"C them, and therefore at fiich a price I will not.
" purchase them." This is the voice of' true libertay,
andt rpeaks that greatners of mind wh~ich it is formed
to inspire.

GOD is a Spirit, nand they that wroesip him, muff

wo liphimin/iri an intruh.That religion chiefly

c~onsists in an inward principle of goodnefrs, is be-
yond difpIute, and that its value and efticacy are de-
rivedl from its e~felts in pulrifying the heart, and re-
ftormling the life. All external services, which have
not t-his tendency, are entirely insignificant. They
degenerate into mere superstition, eqlually unacceptable
to God, and unprofitable to man. Hence they are so
often treated in scripture with high contemp~t, whens
fibilbitutedl in the room of the important duties of aI
virtuous life.

NOTWCITZHSTANDING this, it is certaiin that exter-

nlal services have their o'wn place, and a considerable
one too, in the ijyftem of religion. What their pro-

that w~ithout some returns of sacred! days, and ~om~e

floleman

solemn calls to public w~orthip, it were impofirble to
pres~erve in the world any sense of objeAs, so ··foreign
to the general current of thought as an invisible Go-
vernor, and afuture Rate. If itbe of importance to
the peace and good order of society, that there thould
Sprevail among men the belief of One in the heavens,
who is the proteaLor of righteousnesS and the avenger.
or crimes ; if it be of importance that they be: taught
to look forward to a day of judgment, wthen they are
to be brought to account for their most fcecret:
accions, and eternally rewarded or punished, accord-
ing as their conductS has been good or evil; if such
principles as these, I fay, be of consequence to the
.public welfare, they cer~tainly enforce the authority
of public worship, and prove the necessi~ty of religious.
infiru~tion.

I SPE AK now particularly with a view to the

multituade, the great mass and body of the people.
.We all know, how seldom from education, or pri-
vate infiruaiosn, they have the advantage of deriving
fieatiments of religion or morality. Early obliged to
labour for their bread, they would remain all their
.days in gross ignorance of every moral or sacred prin-
ciple, were it not for those p~ublic as femblies in which
they hear of God, and Christ, and judgment, and
heaven and hell. Shut uip thofie temples to which
they resort with reverence; exclude them from the
-opportunities they now posses~s of rec~eiving religious
infiruAion, and imbibingo religio~us ideas; and what
can you expeat them to becom~e no other than a.

ferocious.

fcrocious ra~bble·, whrlo set~ free fr-om checkrs of con-
feielce,, and fea;rs of dlivine vengeance, wrouldl be
p~ronle to every outr~age whlich thley coulld commlit wvith
impun""ity. It is werll ktnown that, in thle ear~ly ages
of thle worktl, sages anid legilator~s whlo endeaevoured
to, tam~e and to affiociate theo barbarous hlordies of m~en,
tound~ it necefihry fo~r thiis purpose to have recours~e to
religion. Bjy brmnginig thie rude multitudles to ivor-
thipt together, and at slated timies andl places, to join
inl hymus and s~ongs to thieir deities, they gradtually
reitrained themi froml violenice, andi trained them to
subordination and civilizedl life.

DL1R NGe the pr~ogr·ess of faciety in after periods,

religious aff~mbl~ies at: church continue, -I am1 p~er-
fuladed, to have a very considerable jinfluence on the
civilization and improvement: of the people. Even
independent of effeit upon their moral pr~inciples, by
leandinig numlber s of thiem to mreet togethier in an or-
d~erly way, a~nd ini their molt decent appearance, they
tendt to humainriz e andc polish thieir mannlers. They
itrengthen thec social conne~t~ions, andl promlote
fr~iendlly intercourse amiong those wh~o are in the
f~am~e ne~ighbouirhood, anrd ine the famne lines of life.
It muffR at the thmne time, be agreeable to every hu-
mnane m~rind to thi~nk, that one da~y in se~ven is allotted
t'or reft to the· poor f~oro their daily labour~s, andt for
fuich enljoym~ents of eas`e anrd comufort as their flation
affords. It is the onily da~y which gives them occa-
sion to feel themnfelv es as belonging to the f~amle class
of` beings wvith their flperiors ; w~hen joinling wIith

them in the fame afts of wanrfh~ip, anid recognizing a
comminon Lord. Amidfl those dliftil~inctns w\hichh
thle diffecrence of ranlks neceffhrily iltrodu1ce's inito
hu~manI faciety, it is sure-ly fit th!at th~er~e be so~me oc-
cations when maan can .meet: with mian as a brother,
in order that the p~ride of the great may be chleckedl;
and thle low· mary be taught that, if they dil~charge
properly their alppointed p'art, they have reason to
exp'eft, from the L~ord of t-he urniverfe, the fame re-
wards with the rich and the mighty.

IT will, I believe, be generally admitted that f~orms·

of public worsh~ip, and mieans of religious infiruition,
are important, on several accounts, for th~e body of
the people, and belong to the· maintenance of public
safety and order. Buit many who admit this are apt
to think, that to the common people alone they may:
be left. To per~sons of liberal education and enlarg~-
edl minds, what benefit can arikE from h~ear~ing what:
th~ey alr·eady know~; and what, p~er-haps, is to be in;-
culcated on them by thof'e wlrho are of inferior ca a--
city to thlemfl~~ves ?r--Admitting this plea of fir-
periority which their vaniity forms, andi letting afidB
for thle present any personal oblig~ation thecy are un-

acktlnowledgedi.- Besides this, it cannot be admit-
ted that, becadek religious inflitutions prodluce not
all the good that mlight be wifhied, and h~oped for,
th~ey therefore do no good at: all. This were a rafhl
and ill-founded concluclon. If the morals of men
are not always amendcedl by them as they ought to
hlave been, thlere is rea-son, hlowever, to t~hinkr that
they would have been wvorfe w~ithout them. Some
check is always given by them to open profligacy.
Some afifitance is furlnihed to good dif~politions of
heart; at least, to decency of manniers. Even mo-
mentary imprleffions of feriodn~e~fs made on the
thou htlefs by thle folemnities of reli ion, are not
w~ithout their fruit. They leave generally some trace
behind them·~; and when the traces are often renew-·
ed, they may be hoped, through the divine bleiling,
to fo~rm at last a deep imlpreiron on the mind.

A-r the fame time, I do not fay that religious in-

ftitutions work upon the mind like a1 charm; an~d
that mere bodily attend~ance on them will always en-
fulre us of some pr~ofitable effea~. Let the means that
are employedl, for the improvement: of rational beings,
be ever so, p'owerfull in thiemfe~lves, much of their fuic-
cers will always dlepend on the manner in which they
ar~e received and app~lied. I tha~ll therefore conclude
my7j reasonings onl this flibjea~, with a few obferva-
tionis concerninga the dlifpolitions requisite on our
par;"t, for deriving benefit from the public ordinances
o~f religion.

TH~E-r CHOS for wluch we affemnble in thle house~ of

Go~d ar~e twro; to w\orfhlip God, and to listen to reli-
gious inficu~tions.

THE pulblic worfhlip of Godl is the chief and moss

sacred purpole of every religious assembly of Chrifti-
ans. Let it here be remnembered, that it is not the
uttering, or the hearing of cer~tain wrords, that con-
flitutes the wvorfhlip of the Alm~ighty. It is the heart:
that praises, or prays. If the heart accompany not
the words that are spoken or heard, we ofer· the fa-
cr~ile of

fools.,~ol~ By the inattentive thought, and the

giddy and wandering eye, wIe prof~ane the temple of
the Lord, and turn the appearance of devotion into
infuilt and mockery.

WtIr a regard to religious infiru~ion~, attention

and reverence are unqueffionably due. - All religious
and moral knowledge comes fr-om God. It is a light
fr~om- heaven, frirt tranfmittedl to man by the original
conflitution of his nature, and afterwards made to
thline with fairer and fulller luffre by the revelation of
thle gospel in Jefiis Christ. Its brightnefrs may some-
tim~es be fironger, and fomretimes weaker, according
the mediums by wYhich it is conveyed. But it II, as
far as the infirurftions delivered from the pulp~it are
illuminated by the ray from heaven, they are the
truths of God, and ought to be received as flich.
IRefinemnents of vain philosophy, or intricate
fixbtilities of theological controverl~y, are undoubt-
edly not entitled to fach regard. But wIhen the great

principles

our owin pr·ivate conneftions, the changes wthich
hanve takten place in the fafiion o~f te wior~l, mwift touch
every refleding mtind with a more tender sensibility.
For wvhere are nowr, many of the companions of our
ear~ly years ; many of those with whom we first began
the r~ace of life; andt wyhofe hopes and profpea~s
woere once the fame with our own ? n recolleding
our old acquaintance and fr~iendls, what devaf~ationsp
have been made by the hand of time? On the ruins
of our former conne~itions, new ones have arisen;
newy relations have been formed; and the circle of
thofek among whom wle live is altogether changed
from wrhat it once wras. Comparing our present si-
tuation with our former condition of life; Looking
back to our father's hodfe, and to the s~cenes of

but with inward emotion, recolleEts thiofe days of

around us change, but our own life, through all its
flages and conditions, is ever passing awray. How

are br~ought to thet closet·; a ,talr, whiich in some pas-
sages may b~e amlufing, inl others, tedious; but: whe-
ther it aumui-es or fatiguies, is soon told, anld soon
forgotten. 'Thus, year fleals upyon us after year.

the grey hair antd thle faided look are not long~ of ad-
mionifh~ing us, thant old age is at hand. In this course
all generations run. The world is miade up of un-
cearlng rounds of transitory exiflence. Some gene-
ratio~ns are com~ing forward into being, anid others
hafteniing to leave it. The fiream wlhich carries us
all1 along, is ever flowing with a qulickk cur~rent,
thoughl w\ith al fl~ill andi noiseless courfet. Thie dwell-
il ng~r pac of man is conltinually emptying, and by a

As the life of man, considered inl its duration,

thus fleets and passe~s away, so, during thle time it
lnafs, its condition is perpetually chanlging. It as-
fords us nothing on w·hich w~e can sett up our refl;

no enljoyment or poiffetion1 whliClch wecan properly
call our owni. Wheni we have begun to be p~laced
in filch~ circundia~nces as w~e defiired, and wyith our
lives to proceek·in thle fame agreea~ble tenor, how
often comes so~me unexpectted event acrofij, to dif-
concer~t all our scheme~s of happines~s? Our h~ealth~
decclincs ; our fr-iend~s die ; our famtilie~s ar~e scatter~ed;·
famiething or other is not long of occurring, to fhrow
us thlat the wheel mufi tur~n round; thle fJlzJion of` tre
wuorldmuffnJ pas away. Is there any man wvho dares
to look to fulturity wvith an eye of confident hope;
andc to fay, that against a year hence, he can promiife
being inl thle fame condition of health~ or fortune, as
hIe is at pr~esent ? The feeds of change are every
w~here s~own in our sl~ate; an1d the ver~y cadeks that
Tieemed to promise~ us security, are often f~ecr~et;y un-
·derminling it. Great fame provokes the attacks of
enlvy and reproach. High htalth gives occasion to
intemperance andi disease. Thie elevation of thie
mighty never fails to reixiler their condition tottering;
·and that obscurity which thebters the meani, expiofes
Ithem, at the fame time, to become the prey of op-
pr·eflion. So completely is the fa/&ion of this wor~ld
mlade by Providence for change, and prepalred for
pafgiS away5. In the midst of thlis inllability, it were
f'ome comfort,, didt human prosp~erity decay as slowly

with eternal and unalterable splendour. It derives
its origin from heaven; -and partakes both of the

ing; no inconstancy of purpose, and no decay of
wis~dom or of power. We know that he loved
r~ighteounlef~s from the beginning of days, and that
'he will continue to love it unalterably to the last.
Foreseen by him was every revolution which the
cours~e of ages has produced. All the changes which
happen in the slate of nature, or the life of men,
were comprehended in hiis decree. How much
soever worldly things may change inl themselves,
they are all united in his plan; they confitiute one
great fyfitem or whole, of which he is the Author";
and which, at its final completion, thall appear to
be perfeA. ~His domixiion holds together, in a con-
tinued chain, the fauccefive variety of human e~vents;
gives flability to things that: in thems~elves are fludiu-_
ating; gives conflan~cy even to the fa~ion of the,
woor-ld while it is parig ng away. WSherefore, though
all things change on earth, and we ourfielves be in-
volved in the general mutability, yet as long
as, writh truss and hope, we look up to thiis. Su-
preme B3eing, we reft on the r~ock ofr ages, and are
facfe amidst every change. W\e pofrefi a fortres~s to
which wre can have r~ecourse in all dangers; a resurge
under all florms ; a duwlling· plazce in anll ge~nerat~;ions.

tality pass~ not: away. The fleeting scenes of this
li~fe are to be confiidered as no more than an intro-
duL~ion to a nobler and mor~e permanent order of
things, wYhen man thall! have attained the m~aturity
of his being. This is what reason gave some ground

I. z to

to e xpeA; w~hat revelation has fullly confirmed ;
and in confirming it, has agreedf with the f~eathnents
and anticipation of the good and w:ife in every age.
We ar~e taught to believe, that what we nlow behold~,
is only the firfit flage of the life of man. We are ar-
rived no farther than the threthlold; we dwrell as in
thle outer courts of exiff~ence. H-lere, tents only are
pitch~ed; tabernacles ereLded for the s~ojourners cif a
day. B3ut in the region of eternity, all is great, fla-
ble, and unchanging~. There the man/ins of the just
are prepared : ther~e, the city wh~ichi had foulndarionrs is
built; there is eflablifhecd, the kingdom whoick cannlot
be movedc';. Here, ever~y thling is in flir and fludua-
tion; because her~e good mnen continue not, but pass
onward in the course of being~. There, all is
s~erene, fleady, and orderly ; becaufek~there remnairneth
the final up ~/of the sople of God. Here, all is corrupt-
ed by our folly and guilt ; and of courf~ie muff be
tranfiient and vain. B3ut there, purchdekd by the
death, and secured by thle refitrre~tion of the son of
G~od, is an inhrt·)itance ;incotrruptible, urndefledt, and that
faded~r not awany. There reigns that tranquillity which
is never troubled. There thlines that fits which ne-
ver s~ets. There flows thatriver of pleafiires, which.
is always unruffled and pure. Looking forward to
those divine habitations, the changes~ of the present
world disappear to the eye of faith ; and a good man
becomes aihamed of fuffering himself to be dejeated
by what is to ·soon to pass away.

SU.ca are the obje~ts you ought to oppose to the

transient

transient fafl/on of the woruld; V~ilrtue, and God, and
Heaven. Fixing your reg~ard on thereft, you will
have nio r~eafoan to complain of the lot of mlan, or the
world's mr7utability.--- The dtefigni o!` the p~recedling
repr-esentation which~1 I gave of the~ w\orld, wlas nlot to
indulge vain declamiationi; to raifre fruiitiefs melan-
choly; or to throw an u~nneceth~ry cloudl over bamlan
life. But to fhlow the moderation reqlifitee inl our
attachment to the wYorld; and at the fame tim-e to
point out the higher ob~jeas both of attention and
consolation which religion affords.-- Paffirng and
changeable as all human things are, among them,
however, wernufl at prefetnt a&t our part ; to. them
we must retuirn from religious meditation. Th~ey
are not below the regard of any Chiriflian; for they
form the scene which Providence has appointed at
present for his a~ivity, and his duty. Trials and
dange~rs theyv mayv o~te~n present: to him ; but amidit
there he will safely hold his course, if, when engaged
in worldly affairs,, he keep in v~iew thos~e divine ob-
jea~s- which I have been setting before him.~ Let
him ever retain connedion with Virtue, and God,
and Hleaven. By them let his conduac be regulated,
and his conflancy fispported. So thall he u/ thris

Relaxation fr~om intensE, or incessant pursuit, is re-
quilite for comlfort. But if relaxation degenerate
into total idleness, it becomies ina a hiigh degree ad-
verset~ to tranquillity. Every man by h~is nature, is
formed, more or less, for a~fion. I[n a mind that
is entirely quies~cent, anid that has no objeaf to put
it into motion, instead of f`elf-enjoyment, th~ere will
be conflant~ lan!guor, tedioufnlef;, and misery. Life
stagnates in fiich a fituationl, likie a pool of dead
wsaters i and the mian becomnes a burthen to himself.
Vliolentr and danger~ous pursu~its, wYhich diffrad and
emnbroil those who are engaged in them, I cannot be
unlderitood to recommrlend. Every one fees how
fo~reign these are to a slate of traniquillity. But in
the ordinar~y tenor of calm and eafyr life, I wYould ad-
vise every onle to have s~ome end before him; s~ome
objeac which thall bring the mind into a~tion, and
·fill up; thle vatcuities of timue. Provided the objeat
b~e inlnoucnt, and of no unfiiitable or degradling na-
ture, it m~ay'anfwerr this purpose, though it 'hlould
not be in it~self of high im~portance. It is better for
thie mind~to have fa~me determlinate direction given
it, thlan to be always left floating, as it wvere, in
emplty fpacce.-BUut about whatever objeAs wre are
emiployedl, it: is tlill miore material to tranquillity that,
inl t h~e

These· are: the mloft fr~equent dfiftorber·s of our peace.
Nec~ellary as their imnpulfe: is to give adtivity to the
mind, yet if they are not krept in fulbor~dinattion to
reafion, they Ipeedily throw all th~ings into confusion.
Such of them as belong to thle m~alignant and unf~o-
cial class, evidently tend to produce vexation and
disquiet. Aganini~'ft fufering thee to gain poffeffionn
of~the hear·t, admonition is fecarcely necefiary. But
I muff admionifh you, that even thiofe: which are ac-
counted of innocent nature, and wYhich th~erefore
may lay hold of virtuous muinds, if thiey obtain the en-
tire mattery,are fulfficient to overthrowY the tranquillity
of life. Let every one, therefore, who values that
tranquillity, fludy to retain moderation and s~elf-
command, even in the midst of paions which have
a fair and bland appearance. He will find that the
gr~atification of ainy one of theml, comnpenfa~tes not
that perpetual slavery to which it will reduce him,
wihen it becomles inlordinate.

I[ HAVE farther to admonifhy)ou, that this s~elf~-

command is particularly necefrtry in all that relates
to habitual temper. Even where firong pafi~ons
are out -of the qlueffion, thos~e slighter emotions
which rutile or four the temper, are fufficient, by
their frieqluent recurrence, to poison all felf-enjoy.

that I sp~eak not niow to the amnbitious and asp~iring;

Suca p~ersons I also ad~vise·, while thley expe&' not

Seventh,'I1 and la'ft advice on the fiibjeLa, to mlix

Sretreat with the am'~ve bulfinlefs of thle wor~ld, anld to
cultivate habits of serious thought and recolle~ion.
I before advifetd thiofe who ar~e not particular-ly en-
gaged4"in a~ive life, to form to themse-lves s~ome ob-
jeat of purfilit, in orde~r to furnish; proper emlployt-
menit to time and thought. Bjut the great muititude
of mnen are; in a different situa~tion. · Induffry is re-
quired of them ; bu~linef and2 car~es preifs; and accive
purfaits occupy t-heir closest attention. He, w~ho,
in, this situation, pours himfetlf forth incef~mrly ·on
the wvorld, cannot escap~e partaking~ much of its dif`-
tur~bance and trouble. Amidit b~uffle, inltrigue, anld
diffelnton, he muf f pass man~y at . uneafyr hour·.
Here anl enemly encounter~s him ; there, a rival meets

h~im

him. A fufpiicious fr~iend alarmr-s him one hour; an
ungratefull one provokes him the next. I do not re-·
commnend, that for there reasons, he w~ho fludies
tranqc~uillity thlouldf retir~e from all public buifinels,
anrd fo~rsake the h~aunlts of men. TFhis wyere thle re-
treat of a monk, not ofa good and a wife mnan.
Tranquillity were too dlearly purchafedl by the ne-
gled of thlofe duties wvhichl belong to a man, and *a
Christian. NoJ~r indeed ini abilolute feelufion fromt
the world is tranquillity,ever fourid. On the con-
trary, when the human mind is cut off from thoer
employments for which it was designed by nature
and Providence, it preys on itrelf, and engenders
its own mlifery. Tranquillity is alwvays most
likely to be attained, when the business of the world
is temper~ed with thoughtfill and serious retreat.
Co~rmmune writh vourn lIearts ot ~yourtl bed and be fill.
Leaving this world to itself, let there .be s~easons
which you devote to yours~elves, and to God. Re-
flectlion and! medfitation allay the workings of many
unqu~iet p'afions; anld place us at a distance fromn
the tumiults of the world. Wfhen the mind has either
been ruffled or cast dowvn, in intercours~e with God
and heaven wte find a fanAuary to which we can
retreat. In the hours of contemplation and 'devo-
tion, a good man enijoys himfelt in peace. Hie be-
holdls nobler objeats thlan whlat worldly m~en can
behold. Hlie assumes a hligher charad~er. H~E~ listens
to the voice of nlature andt of God ; and fr~om this
holy fanAuai'y comes forrth with a mind fo't~ified
against thle little diiturbances of the world. Such

habits;

hanbits, thereforre, cannrott he· too mnuch recommlendc-
ed to thle lovers of tra~nquillity, as powerful fi'bf~idi-
aIry mneanis for atta~ining that hap~lpy slate.

I HAVE thlus pointred out lhat: ap~ealrs to me the

dlifcip~line of religion annd w\ifilom for tranqluillityy of

--Durinlg the early periods of lifec, vivid fenfaitions
ofpleafure"· are· thle sole objedits thought w~orthy of
p'urfilit. MIere eafei and calmunels are dlel`piled, as
the portion of thle aIged onily and the f~eeble. Somne
longer acquainltance wlith the world, wvithl its d~if-
appointedt hopes andi fallacious pleailres, teaches
alm~ost all men, b~y degrees,. to w\ith; for tranq~uillity
and pea~ce. B3ut you muffi not imagine, that there
are bleflings which will drop onl m~en of their owni
accord as" foun. aste egin to deGre themri. No :
Thie thioughtlefs~, anid the prol-ligate, w·ill ever remain
firangSers to themn. They w\ill r~emain th:e sport of
every accident that occurs to derange their minds,
andl to diflurb their lifet.---The three great eneliess
to tranq~uillity are, Vice, Superstition, and Idlen~ess:
V-ice, which p~oifonls and difl'urbs thle m1ind w\ith
bad patfions; Sup~erstition, wrhichl fills it with ima-·
ginary terrors; Idllenefs, w\hich~ loadcs it w\ith~ etedi-

wste can a rrive at thie b~lelfed temple of Tranq·I~ui l lity,
andc ob~tain a ftatiou thlere: B3y doing, or· at least en-
deavouring t;o do, ou·r duty to G~od and ma~n; by
acquiring a humblle trailt inl the miercy and favoulr of

G~od

God through JeiT~s Christ; by' cultivating our

fr~om thie world, gnld fr-om ment; and in the midst
of worldlly bufinlers, habituating ourselves to calm
~etr~eat abd f'e~rious retcolleationl.-By fulch means asi
thlefe, it mlay be hoped, that, through -the divine

In these: the high and the low, the young and the

which I nowv purpore to illuffrate, in ordler to silence
the feeptic, anid to check a repininr andc Prrelaigious

I. LET U1S Conflder thegexternal condition of man.

We find him placed in a world, wher~e he has by no
meanls the disp~osal of the events that happen. Ca.
lamities fomnetimes bef~al the wor·thiest and the bess,
wlhich it is not in their powver to prevent, and where
nothiing is left them, but to acknowledge and to fiib-
mlit to the high hland of Heaven. For flich viritati-
ons of trial, many goodl and wife reasons can be as-.
signed, wrhich the prefeat fiirbjef leads me not to
dil~curj. B~ut though thos~e unalvoidable calamities
make a par~t, yet th'ey m1-ake not the chief part of the
vexations and f~rovrros that diffr~efs humian life. AP
mutituIde of evils beset us, for the source of which
we muff look to another q-uarter.--No sooner has
any thing in the health, or in the cirfcumflances of
men, gone cro~s: to their withl, than theiy begin to
talk of the unequal diffribution of the good things
of this life; they envy the condition of others ;· hey
repine at their own lot, and fr'et against the Ruler of
the world.

d~erate inl his lifec, andt temlperate inl all tiis pleafilres ?
If n~ow he· be only ayrin~g the price of hiis formler,
perhaps1' his for~gotten, inidulgenzces, has hie any title
to complalin, as if he we·re fuftfer~ing unljuffly ? Were
you to fulrvey thle c~ham~bers of sicknes~s and diffrefs,
you w~ould findt them peopledl with the vidimus of
intemperanice and fetnfl~ility,` ndc with the children
of vitious indlolenice andd sloth~. Am~rone the thiou-

yo ,perhalps, complain of harnldfhips of ano-

ther kind ; of the injuff~ice ofthew\orld ; of the po-

under which~ you labour; of the crosses and difap-

taite, in the gratifications of indtolence or plIeafure,/
can you complain becaus~e others, in preference to
you1, hrave obtained those advantages which naturally
belong to useful labours, and honourable purfuiits ?
H~ave not the cons~equen~ces of some false itep~s, into
w\hich your passions,. or your pleasu~res, have be~tray-
ed you, purfiied you thirough much of your life;
tainltedl, p~erhaps, your chlard~er, involved you in
em~barraf~ien ts, or fulnk you into neglecc ?-I-t
is an oldi saying, that every mnan is the artificer of
hiis owni fortuine in the wlorld. It: is certain that' the
wvorkffld lroml turns wrholly againfl a man, unless
through his

o wn facult. Godlline/S iS, in general, pro-

fiialde unlto all things. Virtue, diligence anld induffryr,
joined with good tem~per and prudence, have ever
been found the filreft road to prosperity; and wihere
mien fail of attaining it, their want of fuiccefs is far
oftener owlihg to their having deviated from that
road, than to their having encountered infirperable
bars in it. Some, by being too artful, forfeit the
reputation of probity. Some, by being too open,
are accounted to fail in prudence., Others, by be-
ing fickrle and changeable, are diffruffed by all.--
The cafe commonly is, that men seek to ascribe
their disappointments to an~y cause, ra~ther than to

their

thleir ow~n mil~eondu £1;; and when they can devis~e
no other caule, they lay theml to the char ~e of Pro-
vidence. Their fo~lly leads themn inito vices; their
vices into misf~ortunes; ; nd inl thieir mijsfortunles
th~ey f~trt aganin/1 te Lord,. They at~e doubly unljuft:
towards God. InI their prosp~erity, they are apt to
alc~ribe their filccefs to thieir own diligence, rather
than to God's blessing~; and in thieir adlverfity, they
imipute their diflfreffes to his providenrce, not to thieir
own misbehaviour·. Where~as, the truthl is thle very

1VHEN fr'oml the condition of indlividuals, we

look abroad to the public slate of the wvorld, we
meet with more proofs of the truth of this affection.
We fee great societies of men torn in pieces by in-
teftine dissensions, tumults and civil commotions.
WVe fee mighty armies going forth, in form~idable
array, against each other, to cover the earth with
bloodt, and to fill thle air withi the cries of widowvs
and orpIhans. Sadl evils thiere ar~e, to wihich this
miserable world is expofed.--B-ut are there evils, I
bese~ech you, .to be imnputed to God ? Was it he
wrho feat forth slaughtering armies inlto t~he field, or
wrho filled the peacefull city witth massacres and
blood ? Are these mis~eries anly other, than thle bitter
fruit of men's violent and diso~rderly pcaffons ?z Are
they not clearly to be traced, to the ambition and
vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great, and to

the

thre turbulence of the people ?---Let us lay them
entirely out of the account, in thiinking of Provi-
denlce; and let us think only of the foolydne/t·s of menr.
Did man controul his passions, and form his conduat
according to the didlates of wiildom, humanl~ityr and
virtue, the earthl would no longer be desolated by
cruelty; and haman societies wvould live in order,
harmony and peace. In thos~e s~cenes of mirchief
and violence which fill the world, let man behold,
with fl~ame, the piL~ure of his vices, his ignorance,
and lfolly. Let: him be humbled by the mortifying

indeedl he muffi be, who dares to thinlk lightity of it.
Hec sh~ows not only the dtepravity of his heart, but,
what perhaps he will be more alhiamed to be charged

IN the fcondr place, let us learn fr~om -what has

b~een s~et for~th, one of the most awful and important
of all truths, thle reality of a divine governme'nt ex-
·ercifed over the world. Blind muff that mlan be,
who discerns not the m-ot fitriking marks of it, in
thle domtine which has been under our review. If
there be a fceetic, wh~o contends, that unreficained
liberty in the gratification of derire is given to man;
that in the fight of his Creator, all adions are equal ;
and that: no rule of moral conduA hath been pre-
fecribed, or b~y any penlalt~y enforced; in order to
confu~te fach a man, we have not recours~e to rea-·
f~onings, but iimply appeal to plain and· obvious
faats. W~e bid~ him look only to the life of man ;
and take notice how ever~y vice, is by the confitiu-
tion1 of things, connefled wvith mifePry. Wje bid
himt trace the hiitory of anly one, with whole condua
hie had pa"rticular occasion to be acquainted; andi
obs~erve, whether the chief misfort~unes which pur-
filed him were nlot brought up~on h~im~ by his ownr
miibehaviour. Wte bid him7 remarkr in the hiffory of

DantlOnS,

naztions, whether public virtue hlas not always ex-
ahted them;, and whether licentioufnefis and criimes
have not paved the way for their ru~in. Thes~e are
testimonies to the truth of religion, which cannot
by anly sophistry be evaded. This is a voice, which
[p'eaks its warnings loud and firong: to every heart.

thlould in a manner execute thems~elves, and carry
t heir fin~itins in their own bosom. Whten thie vices
of men require punifh~mentr to be infliEted, the Al-
mighty is at no loss for min~isters of juff~ice. A

no peculiar interpofals of power are requilite. H~e

IN the th~ird place, to show the injuffice of our

charging Providence wlith a promis~cuous and une-
qual diffribution of its favouri, amnong the good and
the bad. That unequal diffribution takes place in
appeara~nce only, not in reality. The wrhole conr
dult of Providence fulfficiently marks, which of thiof
classes of men it blesses and proteets. TFhe prosp~erity
of sinners is no more than a deceitful- sh~ow. The

wEho will admit, that integirit is an amniab~le qua-
lity; that it is entitled to much refpeaC, and in mroft
cafes ought to influenrce our behaviour; who ne-
verthelefs are ulnwilling to allow it thle chief place la
th\e direi~ion of their wvorldly conduc-. They hold,
that a certain artfid faigacity, ~founded upon knowr-
ledge of thie world, is the best condud~or of every
o~ne, whio would be a facceifsful advem~urer, in life~;
atnd that a ifti~ri attention to, integr-ity, as h~is only
·guide, would often lead him into danger and diffrefs.
In oppolition to teniets of this kinid, I nowp purp~ose
to theLw, that amidit all perplexities and dangers,
ther~e is no guide w:e canl chloofe so sa~fe, and so fulc-
cefsful on thle whole, as the integrity of an upright
mnindt; and that upon ever-y trying occafiion, princi-
ples of probity andt honour w~ill conduLa a good man
thrrough life wtith more advantage, than if he were to
na u·ponl the moil refined fy fele of worldly wisdom.

IT w\ill not take miuch tim~e to delineate the

cha~ralcer of the man of integrity, as by its nature it
is, apXlain one. andt easily underftlood. He is one,
who maikes it his const~ant r~ule to follow the road of
duity, according as the word of God, and the voice
of his consc~ience, point it out to him. He is n~ot
gulidedf merely by affeaions, w\hich· may som~etimes
g'ive the colour of vir~tue to a loose anld unflable
chalrader. Thle uprijghlt man11 is guilded by a fixedf
principl!e of m~ind, wlhich determines hi'm to
elteemr no~thing but whai~t is honourable; and to
abhor whatever is ba~se anld u~nw\orthy, in moral con-

diu&r. Hience you find hlimT ever thle fame; at all
timeis, the trusty fr-iend, the affeationate relationl, the
conscientious man of bufineifs, the pious worhippiIer,
the pu"blic fptir~ited citizen. H-e afibmies no borrocw-
ed appeuarance. He seeks no ma~ik to co~ver himt; for
hie alts no flup'id part; but he is in truthi w~hat he
appears to be, full of truth, candour, anid hum~anity.
%In all his p~urfitiis, he knowvs no path but the Thir
anld direcc one; anl wtoul~d mu~ch~ rather fail of felc-
cels, thanr attain it by repraclihful means. He nlever
fhlows you a fmniljing countenance, while he mledI-
tatres evil against you in his hleart.. He never praires
you" among your fr-ienls ; and. then joins inl traducing
y·ou amnong your enemies.. You wvill never find one
part of h~is charaAer at variance w~ithl another. Ini
hiis mlanners, he is simp~le and unaff~e~ed ; in all his
proceedi ngs, open~ andl confiftent.--Suic h is the
mian of integrity sp~oken of in the text. Let us niow
proceed to fhlow,' inl whalt malnnerc andr with wvhrt·

THE man Of the world aimis at higher things, and

more rapid fiicef~s, thian the miani of modleration and~
virtlue. .But, at the fa~me timle, he incurs greateor
rifqlues, anid dangers. No calculationl of probabili-
ties canl entiire ~safety to himn who is nating a d'eceitfull
part. Amlidit thie unforeseen v~iciflituides of the
wvorld, he hlas to drlead, noct onlly dif~~,Ilappoinertm t to
hiis plans, but thie mifecries also whbich dlete~ted th~Ila-
cies may btring on his head. H-e walks on the edlge
of precipices, where, a fngle fals~e flep may be fatal,
Hle follow:s a wandlering light, wvhich, if it fail of
guidling hiim by a thiort pathi to thie palace of amnbition,
landcs him in thie pit, or the lake. W~hereas he wvho
follows thie guidatnce of integrity, walks in the high
r~oad on whlich the· lIght of the iiin thlines. He fees
before himn the H[-abitationl of P'eace to which his

fleps

RepcIs are dirleatedi; anld if hre beJ longer of arriving at
it, hec is furle of- neithe~r wa·nderinlg falr a~lltry, nor of~
mleeting on hiis road with an~y forms of undufual terror.
--L~et it be alway~t s rrlemember- ed that the p~rinciple
of integrity which direas a~,good man, is fa7r from
excluding prudlence in thle condluA of lisle. It im-
plies no implrovidentt or thoughiteis fimnpicity. On
the conltralry, it is closely conneL~ed w\ith true wvif-
dtom.. A n~YUn of enl~arged ca·pacity, andi extensive
views, is always uIpright. Craf't is merely thle fupI-
p'lementt of: inlferior abilities. It chlaraccerizes a nar-
row\ comlprehenfio n,, and a little m~inid.- A~s the panth
of integr-it~y is onl th~e whole the falfeft p~ath of cozn--
du 8A ; so,

IN the jlondl place, it is unqueftiounaly the mif1

h~onouirable.~ In~egrity is the toundiation of all thtl~t
is high in chanrar~er amnong miankind. O~ther qua-
lities miay add to its fi~plendor ; but if thiis ess~ential
reqIfite be wanting, all thieir luffrte fadces. WC~ere I
drniaio· the chatrradter of: one wtho claimied the ad-
miration of the worldi; and after I had akcribed to~
him eloquence, valour, anid every endowlment that
is moss thiniing and captivating, did I addl, that he·
was a man of too miuch art to be truff~ed, I appeal
to every~ one, whnether·, by this single firoke, the
wvhole charader w!ouldi not. be funk and degraded ?
An1 interrefled and craftcy man may perhaps rife into
'influence and high flat~ion ; he may be a rich and a
pow·erf~ul, but wlill never be a great, man. He may
be fearedi, and exvternallly honoured and court~ed;

but

but in thle irecret thoughts of men he finds no refp~eA.
We all feel, thlat miagnanimouls fetimetinit s cannot
dw~ell inr the famne breast with fefifhnefs~ and deceit.

HE Who rests upon an initernal principle of virtue~

and honour, wvill ac& with a dignity and a boldness, of
w~hich they are incapable who are wholly guided· by
interest. He is above thlofe timid ffifpicions, and
caiutious reffraints, which fetter and embarrals th~eir
conduaf. T~hat firm~ness which the confcioufniefs
of re61itude insp~ires, gives vigour and force to his
exertions on every great occasion. It adds double
weight to all the abilities of which he is poffeft.
It even liipplies the place of those abilities
inl which he is defeetive. They who opp~ose himi
are obliged to honour him. They look up to him
with a s~ecret awe, as to one who moves above them
in a iiperior sphere ; regardless of their good or ill
opinion, of their promise~s or their thlreatenings;
like one of thos~e celefeial lumninaries wh~lich hiolds its
course through its orbit, without being a~ffe~ed by
anly comnmotionis am~ong the elements below. Such
a man is truffed, and relied upon, as well as effeem-
ed, becaul~e all know where to find himl, and upon
what system hre taas. Hle attaches fr-iends and folt-
lowers to himself, without couirting thiem; and
thou~gh his prog~rels towards fame thouldi be flow,
and interru ated at first by crooked arts. it is never-
thelel~s certain and fare. Thle pubic may be milled
f'or a wrhile, in judtging· of real mlerit ; but it: is f~el-

dom3

dom unijuft.~at thle last·. As perfonls continue to come
fai-wa·rd to view, anrd to nac~ their part in tryingS cir-
cumntanlces, their chalra~ers are at leng~th fullyp
alceurta~in ed; and, almloft ahlvays, ra~ted as th~ey de-
serve. HE-ow corrup~t soever the worldt may be, thieyi
carnlott wviti-holdl approbation froml- him, whiofe
conduA is marked br unlif~rmm inltegrity and honour.
Enem~ies he wtilil have; but the puibic fadvours hlim3;
the m-rultitude of m~en winth him fulccers; and define
h~im, in th~eir thoughlts, to every flep of his prefery-
metnt, bdojre he arrive's at it.

I[N the thirdn placel, the plan of conduac, on wphichr

the r!an of incegrity p~roceeds is the mloft conformla-
ble ; that is, attendied with the greatest f~at~isfadican in
,a man's owln minld. Almidft~ the various and per-
plexing evrents of life, it is of singula2r advantage to
be kept free from doubt, as to thle part most~ proper
to be chofeln. He wvho confihlts nothing but wlorldl-
ly interest must, upon every turn of fortune, under-
go much painfurl futpence. H-e is obliged to lifka
with an xious ear to every whisper of: report; and
uponz every new afped wh'!ica1 the fance of atth~irs as-
fiLmes, must fludy hlow to place himfertlf in a1 new
poilure ofdefen~ce. But the man of princip~le is a
firanlger to these inwatfrd tronubles. His tim~e is nlot
lo~t; nor his temlper fre~ttedf by longS and anxiousi
codufltntions. One light alwa;ys thlines upon him
fr·om above. One path, thle palth of integrity·, al-
ways opens clear a.nd difilinat to hlis view~.--But this
is not his only adva;ntage, to be freedl fr~om embarlt-

ralinenits, b~y havinig placed himself under the charge
of one conflannt onlde. H-e is also rewiirde~d with thec
fenfec of having~ chiofew· his guidie well and wifely.
H~e is dleliveredi from all inward upbraidings, fromn all
mnifgivings of mindl, from all alarms foundled on the
:dretad of dlifcoavery andt dli fgrace. A good conscience
enables himl to look back on the part which he has
aL~ed with faltisfad~ian; and to look forward to the
iffuie whichit ma~y bring, without: concern. It is in
the cafe of onie i17iI only, thlat the man whlo aas
from worldly interefit canl enljoy fat~isfadion; that is,
wchen hzis designs have fiirceeded according to his
wvith. But it is the felicity of the man, who a~s
under the dire~ionl of integrity, thazt in every iflie,
le has something to comfort him. Though fiiccefs
has failed him, the consolation rem~ains of having
done hris duty, andc it~udiedl to appro~ve hims~elf to
God.

Tars reference of all his a~ions to divine appro-~

bation, futrnifhes another source of fa~tis~faEion and
peace. HIe looks up, with pleasing hope, to a Pro-
tea-or inl the heavens, wYho kllovej~Ijjth r~igteoufne4 a1d

wlocldly wifdiom is conscious of havinig no title to

universe. B~y qnit~ting the path of righteoufulefs, he
hans le~t: th~at fl·cazight road, in wyhich God h~ad appoint-

w\e can onlly m~ean those; wrho are m~ore rarely fub~jecct
to thlem tha~n oth~ers. Nrow, undler thos~e dillreffes,
religion performs twro o~ffices : It teaches us how we
ought to belr them;; anid it assists us in th~us bearing
them. Macter-ials for both are fo~und in thie wordse
of thle text, wlhichl containi a s~entiment so natural
and juff, as to car'ry conivi~tion to every reasonable
miindi. Thiey were the words of Job, at a time w·hen,
to his other cnalamities, thiis domneftic affliftion was
added, that one, whlo ought to have affliaged and
s~oothed his forrowvs, proivoked his indignation by
an imlpious sp~eech. T~ilu faca~ifl, Job r~eplies, as
one of he fool~lr wtom1~zlen/peaketh : What~zf ? Aanll we r~eceive
good at thre hnd of God,; and fanll wr~e no t rceCivJe evQil?--
Trhree inficutionls naturally aruife from the text :
F~iri, tha~t thiis life· is a mixed slate of goodi and evil :
Secondlyr, That both the goods and the evils in it
procee~d from God : And, thirdly, That there are
juff reas~ons for our receiving with patience the evils
of lifse, fromi the ~fame hand wvhich beffowrs its goods.

I. TAIS life is a mixed state of good and evil.

This is a matter of faa, wh~ich w\ill be denied by
none, and on which it is not necessa~ry to beffow
much illuffrtion. It is evident to th~e slightest irn-
fpeAion, that nothing hlere is unallayed and pure.
Ever~y man's slate is chec~quered with alternate griefs
atnd joys, disappointment and filccef~s. N'o condi-
tion is altogether flable. No life pres~erves always
the fam!e tenor. The viciflitudes of the wyorld some-

times

times bring forwrard thle affiaed into more comfort-
able circumstances; and often troub~le thle joy of the
prosp~erous. This is the train in wYhich. human as-
fairs have ever been found to proceed; and in wh:lich
we may expedb them alway!s to go on.

Buvt tho~ugh this be univerfatlly adm~itted in fp~e-

c~ulation, and of~ten conifeffedi in discourse, the miis-
for~tune is, that: f'ewi think of applying it to their
ow\n cafe. The bulk of masnkind dis~cover as much
confidence in prosperity, and as much impatience
under the least reverse, as if Providence had first
given them afitirance that their prosp~erity wvas nlever
to change, ahd afterw~ards had cheated their hopes.
W~hereas,' what reas~on ought to teach us, is, to ad-
juff our mind to the mixedl slate in wIhich we find
ourselves placed; never to prefirme, never to def'pair;
to be thankfit for the goods w1hich at present w~e
enljoyr, and to expeA th'e evils that may flicceedt.--
TFhou haft been~ admitted to partake of the fe~at of
life. Its good things are diffribut~ed, inl various por-
tions, among the guells. Thou haft had thine al-
lotted sh~are. Complain not, when thy portion is
removed. It is not permitted to any one, to remain
alwrays at the banqluet.

II. WE are taught by the text, that both the

goods and the evils w·hich compole this mixed slate,
c~orne from the htand of God. A little reflefion may
cohvince us, that, in Gond's world, neither good
nior evil canhappen by chance. If ther~e w~ere anly one

dwvell, as is too commiionly donec, up~on thle infnic-
mnents and su~bordinate leanrl s of- our trouble, is fr~e-
quently the cause of much grief, andl much fin.
When w\e viewl our filifering s as proceeding mer~e-

have aclted in briniging th~em upon us, is of~ten more

w~hich~ the se~ntiment of Job is exsprelfed : IF7;alrt ? flll

thiis appeal made to every man's confcienlce, let us
confider,

IN the JSfi place, that the good things- which

God ha~s bellow'ed, afford fiuflicient evidence for our
believing, that the evils which he sends, are not
cauielefslIy or wanrtonly inflid~red. Did we live inl a

wvorld whiichi bore thre maruks of a mnalicious or cruel
govrernor, ter1le mighl t be reafron for dliftnirufing every
f~ep' of: his etcnucft. B3ut in~ th~e or~ldtl which wer inl-
hablit, we behlold, on the contr~ary, plain ma~rks of
predlominantr goodniefs. We behold thie ifrucaure of
thle universe, the ord~er of nature, thle general course·
of P'rov-idence, obviously arranged wvith a b~enev~olent
Iregalrd to thle welfar·e of: men. All thle art and con-
tr·ivance of which th~e divine works are fulli, p~oint to·
this end; and the mlore they are explored, create the
fir~mer belief, that the goodlners of the Deity gave r~ife
to the ryfiem of creation. What, is the conclusion
to be thenice drawn, but that in fuich parts of thie
divine adminiflration as ayppar to us harah anid fe-
ver~e, the fame goodlnefs continues to pr~eside, thoughI
exercised in a hidden and mnyfierious manner ?

Palo v r ars s xxii. 10.

WJHATEVER r~elates to the behaiviour of mlen inl
their social cha~ra~t~er, is of great impocrtanlce in re-
ligion. The duties wvhich~ spring froml tha1t charac-
ter, form many br~anches of tle great~ lawr of: char~ityl,
which is the favour'ite precept of chiriftianity.
They, thierefore, who- would~ separate fiich duties
fr~om a religious spirit, or who at moit treat th~em
as only the infer~ior parts of it, do real in~jury to reli-
gion. They are mniflakie n f~riends of piety, whoi, uni-
der the notion of exaltinrg it, place it in a fort of in-

Efidated

fidlated corner,, disjoined fi-rom the ordcinar·y affairs of
thie wvorldl, and the· coninec~ions of men· with onie
anothler. On the co~ntrary, trule p~iety influences
the lle1.. It accs as a vivifying~ [pirit, wrhich ani-
maltes andc enlivenis, wh~ichI reccifies anid conidua~s
theml. It is no lefsi f·ie~ndlyv to m)en1 t~han zealous for
the hionour of' God; andl by the generous affe~Aions
which it nour~ithes, and thle benificent inrisence
which it exerts on the whiole of condudt, is fully via-
dlicatedi fromn every rep~roa~ch whlich thle jinfidel wouldt
throwv upon it.--In this view, I am now to dis~course~
on the nat~ure and duties of virtuous fr~iendihjip, as
closely conneded wvith the true spirit of religion. It
is a fub~jeia which the jinfpiredl phlofiopher wvho is the
aIuthor of this book of Proverbs, has thought worthy
of his repeated notice ; and in mI-any parrages has be-
flowred the highieft eulogiuies on friendship among
good men. Als ointm~el rnt adpe~rfwner rejo-ie the hrearf,
so dothl the S oeeting~ of a mnan'sfjitnd /y hlea't~y cow~fe2l.

Ar ion farpeeth ron,/oa an farpe ethdecountefcnance

of hi/icud Afae /hrle of thyfrijelnd; for. ~fatit/id are

thle wzoundrs of a fiend.r L A~fjidend ~lovedl at all timecs; anld
at brother is born~ for- ad~veit~y. There is a f-irien that
fZicketh clo/>·r- ithan abt~rothr.-Th~line o'ion fCiendl, andt t/y
fatherc~l's fi~i·rEn it is said in the text, foaklle not.

I MUST begin the filbjeA, by obs~e~rving, that there

ar~e among mankintd friendfhaips of: diff~erent kinds,
or, at leaflt, connexions wYhichl afllTume that name.
WthenI they are no more than coniederacies of bad
m1en,) they ought to be called consp~iracies, rather

th~an

than fr~iendnhips. Somne bond of commoni interest,
some league againftl thle innloc..nlt and unfrplteCding,
m~ay have uniited them f~or a timec. B3:!1i: y are held
together only bry a rope of sand. At bottoml th~ey
are all rivals, anid hoffile to one anoether. Their
frienldfhip canl fubGill no longer· tha~n inter~est cements
thiem. Every one lookrs wvith a jealous eye on his
fulppof~e d friend'; anld watches the first favourable op-
portunity to dese-rt, or to betr-ay.

FRIENDSHIps too thiere are: ofa different kind, anad

of a mlore refpeaactr ble natlr~e, formed b-y the con-
nieaion of poliitical p~arties. It: is nor, perhaps, on
feithffl or cr~ookedl delg~ns that ilich frijendfhlips ar~e
originally founded·. M~en have been associated to-
gether by fomte pubic inltereft, or general cause, or
fol(r defence againit some real or imagnlined da~nger;
and connlexions thrus; for~med, often draw m~en into
close unlion, andt infpIire for a feafoi n no sma~ll de-
gree of cordial attachmenit. Whlen upon juff anld
hionourable principles this unzion is founded, it has
provedl on various occasions, favoaurble to the caule
of liberty and good order among mannkinid. At the
fame time, nothing is more r~eady to be abused thlan
the namer of public pir~iit, and a public cause. It is
a name, under which private interest is often th~el-
tered, and fefithl designs are carried on. Thle un-
wvary are alllured by a ~specious appearance; and the
hleat of faAion ufizrpz s the place of the genlerous wanrmth
of frienrdfhlip.

ITT

IT is no0t of such friendthiips, whether of thle lan-

dable or the fuidpicious kindt, thant I am now to dif-
c~ours~e; but of private fr·iendships, which grow nei-
ther out of inter~efled designs, nor par~ty zeal; but
wrhichl flow froml that similarity of difpolitions, that
corresp~ondin~g harmony of mind~s, wvhich endears
some pers~on to our heart, and makes us take as much
part in hiis circumflances, fortulnes, and fate, as if
they were our own. The~~ oul of fnathan wans knit
with~ the/ourl of Davrid ; andl ~o~nathfnl loved! kimt as h~is
eown/oul*. Such friendships certainly are not unr~eal;
and for the honour of hauman nature, it is to be
hopedi are not altogether unfrequent among man-
kinld.--Happy it is, when they take root in our
early years; and are engrafted on the ingenuous ~fen-
fibility of youth. Frlendfh~ips then contradted, re-
tain to the last a tenderners and warmth, s~eldom pof-
sessed by frienldfhips that are formed in the riper pe-
riods of li~fe. The remnembrance of antient: and
youthf~ul connexlons melts ever~y human heart, and
the dissolution of them is, perhaps, the most painf'ul
feeling to w·hich we are exposed here below.-B-~ut
at whatever period of life triendflhipss are forme~d, as
long as they ·continue sincere and aftfeL~ionate, they
form, undoubtedly, one of the greatest blessings we
can enjoy. B3y the pleasing communication of all
ouir sentiments which they prompt, they: are, juffly
aidi~ to double our pleatirres, and to divide our for-
rows. They give a brighter fuinfhline to the gay
incidtent-s of life; and they enlighlten the gloom of its

darker

conflanicy is wanting, there cain be no fidlelity, which
is thec othier bas~is of' fiendficl hip. For all friiendlfhip
fupplll' es entire conlfidence and~ truit ; fuippoles the
rea~l of- feccrecy to b~e inviolable; fulppofes- promlifes
andl enlgageme nlt s to be facredt; andi no adlvaltagree of
our ownlr to be purfuli edl , at. thle expencice of our fr'iendc's
hlonourl. An inlconit~ant man, is defpticable. A
faith.less mian, is base3.

Bu1r suPPOsin~g neither conflancy nor fidlelity to

be altogethler wannting, still however fr~iendfhipp is inr
hazardc of fulfetring fr~om the follies, and unreakonable
hlumours, to whichi all of us ar~e liable. It is to be
regarded as a tendter p~lanit in an unfavourable foil,
whiich, in order to its flourithing, requires to be
reared and nurfedl withi care. Thle followineg direc-
tions miay be of use for promoting its cuiltivation, and
pre~serving it from whatever· might be ap~t to blast and
wither it.

IN the f flI place, let me advise you not to expe £t

per~fe~ion in any withi whom you contraL& friend-
th~ip. It holds in general, with refpedt to all world-
ly purfulits, that the more modler~te our expe~tations
ar~e, they are likelyr to be the mor~e iic~cefsfll. If, in.
alny thunition of life, wre hope to poflefs comp~lete.
happtinlels, w·e-mayr depend on receiving mlor~tificati-
ons. If, in any perib~n, w\e trust to find nothing
bu~t per~feaion, w~e mary be affluredl tha·, on. longer
acquainitance, we sh~all m~eet with dilaippointments.
In thle cafec of friendfhaip, this 'adm~onition is the

mainy a friienhipcili, halfily I·erhaps conltradte d, is as
hafitily diff'olved, and difg~uff faccceeds to violent at-

'In thec j~cmd. p~lace, I mluff admonif h~ youl not to

be !lrt by dlilfferences of op~inioni arising in inte~r-
course: with your frienlds. It is imp~ofible for therec

niot .

niot to occur. Pcrhaplls nio tw~o p'erfons were ever
cast so exad~ly in the flunc monktl, as to think always
inl the flune· nuinneLr , onl \every fitbjea~. It was w·ifely
conitriv edl by P'rovidenice, thiat dliverfity of felntimlent
fhouldd take p!lace among men, onl purp~ose to exercile
our falculties, andt to give variety to humnife.
P'erpetual unliformlity of thoughlt wvouldt become mo0-
notonlous and insip~id.--- Whenl it is w\ithl regarld to
tr~illers that diverflity or colrtr~arietyr of opuutlous flow~s
itse~lf, it is ch~ildlith in the last degree, if this becomie
thle ground of eftrangedi atfcElion. WJhen frioml such
a cnadethere ar·ises anly breach of fr~iendfhlip, human
wveaknefs is then dirc~overed in a mortifyting light.
In matters of ferIious miom~ent, the ~feaitiment s of the
belt andrt worthiest may vary fr~om thiofe of thieir
fr~iendfs, accordinig as their lines of life diver~ge, or as
their temper, andc habits of thougrht, pree~nt· objeds
undier different p~oints of view. Bult amnong candid
and liberal mindfs, unity of aff~e~tion wrill iill be pre-
f~err·ed. Nlo manl has any title to ered his own~ opi-
nions into an univerfid and inifaLllible standards : Anid
the mlore enlarged that anly mlan's mind is, thle more
readily he will overlook difference in fenitiments, as
lonlg as he is perfitaded tha~t the mind of his friend is
upr·ight, and th~at he follows the didcates of conf~ci-
ence and integrity.

IN the tird ·lplace, It is material to thle preferva-

tion of friendsh~ip, that opennes~s of temper and man-
ners, on both h~andls, be cultivated. N\othring more
certainly difolbves friendfixp, than the jealodyf

po"liticalill and paty frliendlfhlip)s of w\hich1 I before

B~ut it is altog~ethecr inconsistent w~ith thie sp~irit of those

THE solid/1 t iviCe Which I giVe 15, TO CUltiVnte,

ini all inltercourf~e amlong frienids, gentle and obliging
manners. It is .a commlon error to fuippofe, that
~famiiar intima~f cyr fupetrfdes attention to the lesser
duties of bethaviour ; ·and that, urnder the notion of:
fr~eedom, it ma~y exscule a careless, or even a rough,
demeanmour. On the contrary, anl inltimate con-

nedion

nel5io n canl only be kept uip, by a confl~ant writh to
ble p'leafing andi agrecablle. Th~ie nearer miid closer
tha~t men are broughtl togethe~lr, the m-ore fr~equent
tha~t thle p~oints of: contntah between themn become,
thlere is thle greater neceAit~ y for the ilfurthee being
fmj~oothl, and every thing b~einlg remnove d that canl
gratec or offendlt.--Let: no har~shness;, no appIear-
alnce of nlegleA, no ilipercilious affetation ofP fipieri-
ority, occur in the inltercourfe of frijelrus. A tar~t
rep'ly, a pronenieis to rebukte, a capitiouls and con-
tradialitious sp~irit, are of~ten known to embitter do-
mneftic lif~e, and2 to set fr~iendIs at var~iance. In those
finaller art-icles of behaviour, wvher~e men are too apt
to be careless, and to indulge their hum~our without
r·effraint, the reafl charaderC is often underfloo d to
br~eak< forth, and thlew its~elf. I't is by no means
enough, that, in all m~atters of ertliou~s inter~est, we
th~ink odrfelves retady to .prove thle sincerity of our
fr~iendfhip> . Ther~e occur· morerael~tle y . Thle ordina1-
ry tenor of life is compofedr of finiall duties and offices,
wvhichh men have occa~ionI da~ily to perform; andl it
is onlyl by rendelrringc daily behaviour agr~eeable, that
w\e can long preserve the comforts of friendship.

IN the fifrt place, let- me caution you not to liifen

rafhlyl to evil reports againfl your friends. W'hen
upon1 proper grounds you have formed a ·conne~ti-
on, be flow of' beiePvingany1 thinga ~aainfi~t te fr~iendl

charaler of a .w\ife and good mnan, that hie is not
prIo ne to take·~ upy a rep~oroac arg ait? bi~s neighlourr.

IN t';e frthr and last place, let me exhort you niot

to defeclt your fr~iend in danllger or diftfrel~s. Too
mnyzl~ thlere ar~e in· the w\or~ld, whlol~e attachment to
those they call their fr-iendis is confined to the day of
their pros~perity. A~s long as thant coltin1ues, they
aIre, or appealr to be, af~fetAionat e alnd cordial. Bjut
as soon as their fr~iend is underr a cloudl, they lIegin
to w'ithdrlaw,, and to s~eparate their interefls from his.
In friendlnhips of this fort, thle hear-t, afllredly, has
never had much concern. For tl.e great test of true
friendfhlip, is conflancy in thle hour· of danger·, adhie-
rence in the fetaf~on of dliffrefs.-W~ahen your friendi

is cahuinniatted then is the timne, openly and boldlyS
to efpodue his cause. When hiis situation is chiang-
edl, or his fortunes are fallinig, then is the time of
affo~rding promp~t and zealous aid. When sick;ness
or infirmuity occasion him to be negle~ted by others,
that is the opportunity which ever~y real fr~iendt wrill
seize, of redoubling all thle affe~tionate attentions
w\hich love ~liggefts. Theret are the- important diu-
ties, the fa~credl claims of fr~iendsh~ip,- which religionz
and virtue enforce on every worthy mind.--To sh~ow~
yourfetlves warm, after this mannler, in the cause of
your fr~ienid, commands effeem,; evetn from those
who hiave pers~onal interest in op~posing him. Thiis
honourable zeal of fr~iendfhiip, hias, in every age·,
attradecd the venerat~ion of mnankind. It has con-
fetcrated to thle latest poffer~ity the namles of t~hos~e whlo
have given up their f~ortunes, and have even expofedl
th~eir lives, in behalf of the fr~iends whoml they loved;
whrile ignominy and disgrace have ever been the por-
tion of them, wvho defelrted their fr·iends in the evil
day~. Thline own/-f·rr~uiend ~firfae no~.

F·ROM there words I purpose to discourse of
the pr'oper condult which we ought to hlold wiith
regard to fulturity, amidf1 the prefenlt uncer·tainties
of life. Time andi life are always going onl, and to
eachl of us arer I)pre~parin ch~anges in our slate. What
these mcay be, w~hether for the better or for the worse,
wte canlnot tell; as it: hath pleafred the wildfom of
providence to cover fuiturity writh a veil whbich no

Ms~l m ortcal

mocrtal can lift up.· In theo mean timne, none of us
ca~n avoid forming defligns, and layinig plans for the
time~c to comie. Thie partlent mome1n~t is nlever fuffi-
clent to give full empilloymie nt to thle adive minds of
mann, w\ithout famec excurflons into f~uturity ;and
in there excurflous, the prelent is ofteni wholly spent.
It is therefor~te of -thie hiigheft confrequenlce, th-at a
p>roper dir~e~ion be given to the m~ind, inl its employ-
mnents of `thoughlt relating to futurity. Otherwise, in
the prof'pea~s whlic~h w~oe takie of that unknowln region,
faITc ls hpes, or ill-grounlded fears, thall flatter or tor-
ment us in vainl. ~Ire know not, as the Wife IVMan
tells us, whatm a da~y may1 br.ingS fo-th. It. may, very
probably, produrce fomethinlg that we had not look-
ed f:or·; and thleref-ore inftelad of boafing!~ owf~l·lilv2 of·
to-mlor~rowt, as the multitude are apt to do, it becomes
us to be dik~ipline~d andi prepared, for wlhatever it
mlay bring.

IT is needles~s to spend much time in confirming

the truth, which is the foundation of the admoniti-
on in the text ; in proving,~ either that change and
mnutability belong to our present slate, or that the
changes of it cannoot be foreseen by us. Ther~e are
truths so obvious an~d confeff~ed, that an attempt to
confirm them is like proving, that all menl are to die.
At the fame time, obvious as they are, it were to be
wtinhed that the thoughts of men dwelt upon theml
mnore. For, by a firange but prevailing~ deception,
it '\\ould seem, fro~m the general con~duac of mankind,
that almost every one thinks his own caf~e an excep·

tion~

tion from the general law; and that he m~ay build
plans with as mulch1 confidnc1( e onl hlis prTefnt fitua-
tion, as if some affulrance hadir been give~n hiim that
it wvere never to change. H-enice it: has been of'ten
oblervedt by serious p~erso~ns, that there is' no more
general caule to which thec vices of men canl be
alcribedl, their forgetfurlnels to G~od, and thieIr ne-
gled of duty, than to their prefllming upon the con-
tinuance of life, of pleasure, and prosperity.

L~OOK but a little way, my friends, into your own

state; and you muff unavoidably perceive that, from
the beginning, it has heen so contrived by Providence,
that there thiould be no permanent fl~ability to man's
condition on earth. The feeds of alteration are every
where fowYn. In your health, life, poffeffions, con -
nealouos, pleafulres, thlere: are caules of decay imper-
ceptibly working; se~cretly undermining the foun-
dations of what cappears to you the moss flable; con-
tinlually tendin~g to abolish the prefeat form1 of things,
and to bring forward new appearances, and new ob-
jeAs in their or~der: So that nothinlg is or canl be,
flationary on earth. All changes, and pa~ffs. It is
a fiream which is ever flowing; a wheel which is
ever tur~ningg round. WThen you behold the tree
covered withi bloffomns in the spring, or loadled withm
friuit in the autumin, as well mnay you imagine, th~at
thos~e blotomns, or that fruit, are to remain in thieir
lplace through thle whole- year, as believe that human
affa~irs arec to continlue, fo~r to day and to-mor~row~,
for thliy year an<( tle: next, pro~ceeding in the fam:e

tenor.--To rendter th~is refleccion flill more serious,
thinlk, II p'ray you, onl what fmnall and inconfidera-
ble caul~es thlofe changes dtepend, which affeA the
fortunes of mnen, thr~oughlout their w~hole lives.
If-ow\ f~oonl is evril don~e! T her~e needs no oreat buille
or flir, no long preparation of events, to overturn
what s~eems moss secure, andi to blas1t wha~t appears
m~ost flourithing. A gale-of wind rif'es on the ocean;
and thle vessel w~hich carried our fr-iends, or our for-
t~unes, is overwhlelm~ed in the deep. A fp~arke of a
candle falls by night in som~e neglet~ed corner ; and
th~e whole fiibitance of fam~ilies is confumedc iti flames
before thle morning. A casual blow, or a fuidden
fall, de(·anges fomne of our internal parts; and the
reft of life is diffr~els ~ndt m-riifer. ITt is cawfu~l t~o think
at the mercy of how\ many s~eeming contingencies we
perpetually lie, for what we~ call happiness inl this
world.

IN thle midit, h~owever, of all there app~arent con-

tingencies, plans and designs for the future are every
day formed; pursuits are undertaken ; and life pro-
ceeds in its utizal train. Fit and proper it is, that life
thlouldd thus proceed. Forr the uncertainty of to-rnor0
row w~as never defG~ned by Providence, to deter us
from ading or planning to day; but only to admo-
nifhl us, that wIe ouight to plan, and to aEt, soberly
and wife~ly.--What that wvife and sober conduac is
wrhich becomes us, wvhat the rules and precautions
ar~e, wrhich, inl fiwh a slate as ours, reFpeLa futurity,
I now proceed to ihow. They may be comprehend-

edl in thie foillowvingr dire~ions. Boast not thyself of
to-morrlow; Derlpair n ot of t~o-mor~rowy; Delay not
till to-morrow whalt is proper to be done to,-day;
Prlepare t~hyself for wh~atever to-·n!norro maty brjing
f~orth; BUrild thy hopes of happ~iness: on something
more s~olid andl 1lating than what either to-day or to-
morrow wiillprodtuce.

I. IN the words of the te xt·, BoafZ not thy/elf o$f o-

morrow07L; that is, nerer prefilme arrogiantly on futu-
rity; in the moss fair anld prom~ising slate of fortune,
bew~are of pride and vanity ; ~beware of reffing
wIholly upon yourselves, and forgetting H-im whro
direEts the ,changes of this mutable slate. If there
be anly virtues, which the uncertain condition of
the world inlculcate on man, they are, affliredly, mo-
dteration and humility. Man was, for this end,
placed in a wrorld, where he knows so, little of what
is before him1, that he might be impressed with a
se~nse of his dependence on the R.ualer of the world;
that he might feel the importance of acquiring favour
and proteaion from H-eaven, by a life of piety. andl
virtue; anld that, not knowin~g. how soon his own
condition may be the fame wit'a that of the most
wr~etched, he might be prompted to aBt towards all
his brethren the humane and friendly part.-Thre fa-
vours which Providence beffows upon him at pre-
frent, he ough~t to receive w\ith thlank~fllnefs , and
may enjoy wlith chearfillnef~s. Though comm~and-
edl not to boas3 kimftJElf of to-mor~r-ow, the meaning of
thle precept is not, that hie muifr be fad to day. Re-

IV. To be every day prepared for whatever to-

morrow may bring forth. There is a certain prepa-
ration for the vicifirtudes of life, in which the multi-
tude are f~ufficientlyr busied; providing, as they
think, against whatever may happen, by increasing
their riches, and ·firengthening thems~elves by friends,
connedious, and worldly honours. But these bul-
·warks which they ereA, are totally inf~ufficient
against the dreaded storm. It is to some other quar-
ter we muff look for our def~ence; for whien it: is the.*
world its~elf, whose changes we have reason to dread,
the world, and the things of it, cannot afford us
proteAion. The best preparation for all the uncer-
tainties of futurity con~ifts, in a well ordered- mind,
a good conscience, and a chearful f~ubmiiron to- the
will of Heaven. You kinow not: what shall be on
to-morrowy. But there is One who knowYs it well;
for his decree hath fixed it. To him look up with
reverence ; and fay, " Not myn5 will, but tkine be dote ;

SN this wvorld, w~e are placed as companions and
assistants to one another. Depending, for most of
the comfoirts of life, on mrutual intercourse and aid,
it was nece~lhr~y, thalt we thould be formled to delire
thle comnpany, and to take pleasure in the good will
of our fellows. B3ut thiis faociability of man, though
esse~ntial to his prelent condition, has, like many
other goodl princip~les, been unhappily warped fr~om
its original p~urpore ; andi, in the prefeat slate of the
wor~1ld,) ha;s pr~lovd thle cause of much~ evlil. For, as
vice has abounlded in every age, it hath propagated

THE wror~d is too juffly said by icriptur~e, to lie

in wickedng9II~ . It is a school wYherein every vice is
taught, and too easily learned. Even fromn our ear-
lieft childhood, false ~sentim~ents ar·e in~flilled inito our
minds. We are bred up in admniration of the exter-
nal thfow of life. We ar~e accuflamed, as soon as
wle can underfland any, thing, to hear riches and ho-
nours fIpoken of as the chlief goods of men, and pro-
]posed to us as the objea~s to wvhich our futur~e pur-
fulits ar'e to be direL~ed. W~e fee the mleafres of
oultwardl I~rtefp and deference taken fromn thes~e
alone. Religion and virtue are recommendde to us,
in a formal manler·, by our teacher~s and6 infitCuaor's;
but allI improvements of the mind and heart, air
visibly placed by thle wtorld, in an in~fer·ior rank to
the advantages of fortune. V'ices, thiat chanice to
be thfhiionable, are treated as flight fhilings ; and co.
lour~ed over, -in comm7ron difcoulrfe, with th~ose3 iof~t
and genltlee namnes which explrels no condemnationi.
We enter, perhafps, on the wrorkil, with good prinl-

cip~les,

once beheld it. W1e· beginl to th~ink, that what is so,
very~ gen~eral, ca~nnot b~e highly crim~inal. TShe ma12-
lignity of fii n ppears dimitinihedl, by so many being
thar~ers in the reproach; andi ifiiicad of ments vice~s
detracciing, as thley oughit to do), f·orom our good opi-
nioni of thle metn, our attachmecnt to thie mien ofEitene
reconciles us to the vices of which, the~y are guilty.

THE countenance whlich~ fn receives fromt thle

pradice of thie mlultitude, not only removes thie re-
ficainlts whilch are imnpofed by mnodtefy anld fluunell;
but, such is thie degeneracy of the world, that thalee

ncver~th~ele~s found realki ng in the evayof~ fjnnrs, anld
faingr~ in delt chair· of the f-'orn~fj ?--I ntereft, too, often
coinicides with this w~eakness of dipliortion, in tempt-
mo-: fuich >erfonis to follow the miultitude. To fall
inl with the p~revailing tatce, to falit themselves to thle
passion~s of the great, or to the humours of the low,
wnith whom they chance to be conne~ted, appears
thle readiest way to rife in the wrorldi. He~nce theyv
are nlaturally led to relinquish the firmnnefs of an up-
righlt charadter, for that fiipple and verfa~ble turn,
wvhichl accomrmodates itself to the times, and afliumes
wrhatever appearance fkeems mos0t convenient for in-
tereft.---Suchl are the dlangers to w\hich we are ex-
p'ofed, in times of corruption, o~f fllJazoingS the mulrlti-
tudIE to d~o e·vl ; dalngers which reqluire our most fe-·
r~ious attenmtion and care, in order to guard ourselves
against t~hem.--I proceedl to lay flich considerations
before you as may be ulfeful for that: pur~pole.

IN the fir? place, Let als rem~ember that the mul-

.titude are very bad guides; are so far from havin~g a
title to implicit regard, that he 'who blindly follows
them, may be prefirmed to err. For pr~ejudice andl

struck by the outside of things ; they inquire fuiper-
ficially, admire false appearances, and pulrilie false
goods. T~Sheir opinions are for the most part, hastily
formedi, and of cour-se are variable, floating, and
inconfilltent. In vever~y age, how finall is the num-

In

la thre thritrd place, whether ther~e be not several

ciretunfla~·nces, which peculiarly Iggr~avate the guilt
of thiofe who follow the multitude in evil. Do you
niot, thiereby, ftrenlgthlen th~e power of fin, and per-
petuate thie pernicious influence of badl example ?
B3y firikilg: off from the corriupt~ed cr~owdl, you mighlt
be eminently useful. You mlight animantee and reco-
vrer many, whom weakness andi timnidityt keep under
bondlage to the cufftomls of the world; whereas, by
tamely yielding to the current of vice, you render
that current fironger for carrying others along; your
add wleight and flability to thre bad cause ; you lend
to thre multitude all the force of youlr example, for
drawing others after them, to the commiion of evil.
-W~hile you aire thus accethr1y to thre ruin of others,
you are, at the famne time, fl~amping your own cha-
raaer with the foulest and deepest imprefirons of cor-
ruption. By fistrenderingl your judgment and your
consc~ience to the mulltitude, you betray the rights,
and dfegrade the honour of the ratio~nal nature. No-
thing gr~eat or worthy can be expeAed of him, who
inllead of considering wvhat is right in itself, and
what par"t it is Sitteft for one in his flatio£1 to adt, is
only confidtering what the world will think, or fayi
of him; what fort of behaviour will pass with the
faireit thow, and be mos1 calculated to please the
many. Wh~en a man has thus given up the liberty
and independence of his mind, we can no longer
reckon upon h~im in anly thinlg. We cannot tell hrow
far he may be carried in vice. T~here is too much
ground to dread, that he will lie, dissemble, and hel

IN thle fourrth place, thant the mioft excellent and ho-

nourable chntactraer which cani adorn a1 man aInd at
Christian, is acquired, by resisting the torrent of
vice, and adhierinig to the caul~e of God and virtue
against a corrupted multitude. It will be found to
holdl in gJeneral, that all those, who, in anly of the
great lines of life, have diftinguiihed themselves for
thinking p~o~foulndly, and naing nobly, have deipifed
popular pretjudices, and diepar~ted, in several things,
fro~m the common wayps of the world. On1 no occa-
sion is thlis mlore requisite for true honour, than
w~here religion and m~orality are: concerned. In times
of prevailing licentiouf~neis, to maintain unblemith*~
ed virtue, and uncorrupted integrity; inr a public
or a p'rivate caufet, to fland firm by wrhat is fair and
just, amidit difcouragements and opposition; def-

pifing

p'ifing ground"lefs cedu~re and reproach; difdlaininlg
allI comp~liance with p~ublic mannners, when they are
vicious anid unla~wful; and nev~er afhlamed of the:
punAual disc~harge of every durty towrards God and
rrnan;--this is what thlows true greatness; of s~pirit, and
wvill force app~robation even fromn the degeneraite
mu~ltitude themifelves. "L This is .the man,"' their
confcienlce will ob~lige them to acknowledge;,
aC whlorn we ar~e un~able to benid to m~ean cond~efcenl-
"C fions. Wre fee it in vainl either to flaztter or to'
"6 hrerateni him; hie rests on a principle within, which
"L cannlot thlake. T~o this man you may, on any
"L occairon, safely comm1Ilit your cause. He is inca.·
"' pable of betraying his truss, or deserting his
"' friendl, or denying his faith." Thus lis r~igheouf-
ne/s; comcs foltrt as thle ljo~j, andr kris judg~mentl as the
npoon-dalny.

I1r is, aclcordinlgly, this fleadyr inflexible virtue,

this regar~d to p·rinciple·, superior to all cuffo~m and
opinionl, wvhich~ peculiar~ly ma~rked the char~ader~s of
those, in any age, who have sh~one as; faiints or he-
roes; and has consecrated their memory to all pof-
terity. It was this that obtained to antient Enocki
the most singular teffimony of honour fr~om heaven.,
~He continuedet to reanlk wuith GodE, when the wrorld
apofltatifed fromn him. H~e pleased God, and was
b~eloved of him ; so that, living among sinners, he

morttl honour, of being the reflorer of a better race,
and the father of a newr world., Such examples as
these, and filch honours co~nferred by God on themr
wh·lo writhflood the multitude of evil doers, thlould
often be present to our minds. Let uts opp~ose themn
to the numnbers of low and co~rrupt examples, which
we behold around us; and when· we are in hazard
of beinlg fivcayed by flich, let us fortify our virtue,
by thinking of thlofe: who, inl former timnes, thlone
like stars in the midlit~ of fiirrounding darkness, and
are now th~ining inl the kingdtom of heaven, as thte
brlghltmfs~ of lthe frmament, ftrl evrc'P~ and ever·.--As our
honour is thuls deeply concerned in our aEting a fled-
fast and virtuous part, let us also confider,

6N the ffthI place, How little, in point of interett,

can be gained by the favour of the mlultitude, and
how much will certainly be loft, by following them
to do evil. WVemay, thereby, render ourselves more
agreeable to s~ome with whtom we are conne~ted; and

by

by artfuil comlpliances, many please ourselves with the
profpea" o'f promo"tinlg our fortu~ne. B~ut thele ad-
vanltages, fuich as they are, remiain doubtful and un-
certain. Th~ie windl of: popular op~inion is ever th~ift-
inig. It will often leave us at a loss what couirfe to
fleer; and, after all our trouble a~nd anxiety to catch
thle favo·ur~able galle, it: may on a fuddi~en forfalke us.
For thne verla;tility of charad~er, thle meantnels; andi
inconf~ifenicy of condruQ, into which a dependent
on the multitude is betrayed, fr~equently render him,
in th~e endc, an objec2 of co~ntempt to those: whom he
fought to please. But fiippofing him fuiccefsful in.
his views, nio worldly advantages, which are pur-
chased by diahonourable means, can be either s~olid
or lafling. T~hey bring no genuine f~atisf~aion to a
man, who is conscious to himnfelf of having: given
uIp his pr'inciples to serve the world. As long as he
could be s~atisfied with his ownr conduA, he might:
b~ear up' un'der ndeferved difcouragemetnt; but when
he becomes delp~icable in his own eyes, wvorldly ho-
nours lose thieir luffr~e. -What c~an the mlultitudle do
for you, after you have followed theml in evil?
Thiey cannot reflore to you the peace of an innocent
mind, nor heal the sorrows of a wounded fpirjt, nor
th~ield you from1 the difp~lealihre of God. They canl
do little to fulpport you in the houlr of affi~ion, and
nothing to deliver youir fo~uls in the day of death.
Forfa~cken and dirconfolat~e, t~he wYorldi, for thle most
part, casts off- its votaries in the end ; andi whien you
compute the final amount, it will prove a very fluall
conso~lation, thlat, as you have had fhlarer~s in gouilt,
you thaall h~ave comipanions affo in punishment.

IT is of thle highief importance to relig~iou~s condull,
that our minds be filled with fiiitable conceptions of
the att~ributes of God. They are the foundatio~ns of
our reverenice for himt~; and reverence is the fouinda-
tion of religion. All the divine perfeAions are in-
te~eff~ilg to man. Almighty power, in conjun~ion
with Et~ernity and Omlnipr·efence, naturally insp~ires
folemln awe. Infiniite Goodtnefs relieves thie -mindi
fromn thaft opp)1C~reion wh~ich1 Powerl alone wo~uld pro-
dutce ; and, fr~om ou.r expierien~ce of present~ benefits,
andc our remembra:nce· of the past, creates love, gr·a-
titudte, andr tr~uss. In the m~iddle betwleen there:,
flands the conltemplationa of divine Wiftiom, which
conljoins imprefiions of awe with those of comfort ;
and whil~e it humbless us int~o profounld fu'omifiTon,

An This concluding dif'courfe is chiefly inltended to be a gene.l

from cunning or cranft. It alwtays ilippofets good and
fair inltention in theo person who posses fes it; and im-
ports, that la~udable enids are purfixed by proper and
justifiable means. Ju like mannner, wvifilom in the
Sup'reme Being canlnot be s~eparated from the r~e~itude
of his !naturie. It is, in hiim, an exertion of benievo-
lence; and imports, that the purpos~es of juffice andi

the mnoft effeatct nal. T'o mleditate onl some of thlofe
inflances in which this dtivine w·ifiom is diplalyed,
canlnot but be highly fa~vourable to the impreflions
both of: pie~ty aind of virtue.

1[r1 is difficult to fa~y, whether the naitural, or thle

m~or~al, worl·d, afford the mroft consp~icuous an~d
~iriking disp~lays of thle whiilom of God. Not one,
nor ma~ny discourses, nor inideed thle fludy and labour
of a wrhole· life, wetre, in any dlegree, fulflicient to
explo~e them.. Of the proofs of whiloml which the
rnatura~l world afford~ts, I cannot atte~mpt now to dif-
course. Any illufirationl of these wouldl lead to dif-
c~uflions of a feientific kinld, which more prop~erly
belong to the philoso~pher ; alnd onl which philoso~phy
has of~teni employed it~icif, wlith much utility. and h~o-
nour. I thlall onlyl takce notice tha~t, in proportion as
huma-rr n knowledg e hlath en~largedl its fphiere of research·

anld

and discovery, inl the thme p~rop'ortion, h~athi the wifr-
d~om of thle Creat !r fitrck the m~inds of all inqurire~rs
and lobfervers, withi thle highieft admiration. All nia-
ture is inl trulth a scene of wonlders. In thle dlifpolition
of' thle heavenliy bodies, andi thle greneral arrangemlent
of the rvitemn of the univers··e: in thle firu~ture of thle
earth; in thle enwifefs valriet~y of livring cr~eatures that
fill it; andt in the· provir~:io madle for them all, to en1-
able themn to fulfil the ends of- their be~ing, it is not
easy to dletermine, whether powecr, wifdlom~, or good-
ness hie moll conspicuous. I: belongs not only: to
theL hea~IvenlS to dlclare the glo~y of' God, andl to th~e fl~rmaInet
to ~··ofbrew lo; hs aniy wrorkiZ ; inl thle sm~allest anld m~ost
inconfliderable, as w~ell as in the mioff illuffrious wvorkls
of God, equa~l ma-rks appea·r of p~rofondllr design and.
consu~mmate art. It hias been juilly thlid, that there
is no~t a vceg~etable that grow~s, nor an infeA that mioves,
butr what is fliticientl to confocund thle athleifrt, and to
affobrd thie can~did olrer~ver endless m~aterials of: devout
adioration and praiie.

WHEM1N w'e turn to th~e mloral wor~ld, thle field of ad-

mnirationi whiich opens to us is no less extensive aznd
ftlaking. I can only mnention a few infltances of that
exquisite wtifdom~ wh~ichi every where meet us.

Ar t~hefir/1 place, let us attend to the conflitution

of hum~an nature. Tfhough we ar·e taught: by revela-
tion, to confider~l it as nlow impaired by thle fall, yet,
as it flandcs, \iie behloldi the traces of a n~oble firac-
ture, planned and executed with the highest flill.

.Now~, fiippole that any one of those fenfecs, thle fight,
for infltance, or thea hear~in~, or the touch, hadl been
in a conside~rable dlegree either more brlunt, or more
acute, than it is at p~resent, what an unhappy change
wlould this hiave maide up~on our slate? On the one

wre nowv enjoy fromi fi~clc powers. On the othier hand,
a grea·;ter· degr~ee ofexquifite fen·Ifibility in them, woulld
have:t ren~del~re life3 aburdten to us. Our s~enses, inl-
dlead of being illet~s to know·\ledge, · and~c pleafrret~ would
th~en ha~ve be~tcome conflannt av.enues to uni~Cieainef andc
p~ain. Trheir power`Is, thereforel'C are fk~ilfullly adjust-

adiv\er the pu:rposes of healthi, safety, and comlfort;
without eithtlr thlling thlort of this lIne of uitfefulnefs,
or improperly, and hurtfully, ficetching beyond it.

IN the mrind appetites and pat~ions wvere placed, as

t~he mlovi~~ng powr~ s of the~ foull, to imipel its a~ivity.
B3ut as their impulse requir~ed regulation and reflraint,
~redon wals, a~t thet thme11 timle, conlferred as the di-·
retti~ng powelr.--Of all1 our passions, f~elf-love, andi
rthe dleire of i~~f-elf-refervation, werei~, with the utmloft
prloprriety mader theC frolngef~ti for a reafonl w\hich the

ea~unet c apacity may;1 comprehend. Ev·ery ma~n is

mos1 immedliately committed by P~rovidlence to hiis

best; andr hias more opportunities of promotiig hiis

hlapp'inefs of any othrer perso~n. It was therefore fit
and wrife, th~at, by the fironlgeft infinact, he thlould
be IOlprompte to attendl to himlfelf.--At the famle time,
as no man flanidin~g alonie is fuifficient for his owni
w\elfhre, it w~as necellary that, by mrutual fynapathy
and s~ocial inftinAs, we thould be drawn to give alid
to one another. HT.3ere it dese:rves our par~ticular no-
tice, that the force of thof'e facial inftilnas is, with1
admirable· prop~riety, proportioned by Providecnce to
the degr-ee of their uitfefulnefsi andl impo~t~ance *. Thus,
that parental ~ffeaionl, whEich the helpless slate· of in-
fnacy and chiildhood renders to> needflCI, is madle the
11ronigeft of themi all. Nelxt, come those ties of
blood, which prompt mutual kindniefs among thoer
who ar~e intimaltely joined together b~y brocthezrhood,
anid other thmiiily connlemtonls. To thiele facceeis
that valu~able initinat of pity, whlich impyels us to

of the Autchor of our· framne; even our imnperfeations
tndl flnlieos, are by him~ rendelered su~bservient to useful
ends.-- Amidit thof'e ileqlualities of condition, for
infllance, which the slate of humran life requir~ed, where
it was necessary that fame thlould be rich, andt others
poor, that fomne ilthoul be eminent and diftinguilfhed,
and oth~ers obloulre andt mlean, howr seas~onable is that
good opinion whiich every one entertains of himfe~plf ;

self to others; and that fondt ho>pe, which is ever plea-
sing him withl thle pr~ofped of: future pleasures and. ad-
vantages in life? Wiithoult thos~e flattering s~ensations,
v~iinl as they of~ten are, howv totally insuppor~table
would thiis wtorld become, to many of its inihabitants ?
Whlereas, by means of them, Providence hathl con~-
trived to balance, in a great me~fulre, the ineqlualities
of condtition among mankind. It hath contrived to
diff'ufe pleafilrep through~ all ranks; and to brinlg the
high ands thle lowr nearer to a level with each other,
than might at first be fuippofe~d. It hanth fmrootherd the
mioftrugged tractts of humlan life·; andl hath gilded
with rays of borrow\edi light its mofi dreary f'cenes.

ONE initaOCC Of Divine wild~m, in fr~aming our

nature, is so remanrkable as to demand particular at-
tendion ; that is, thle mealitre according to w·hich,
God hath dispens~ed know~elege and ignorance to mrin.
Ther~e is nlothling of wlhichl we are mlore ready; to com-
plain, than of our narrow· andl confinedi vriews of na-

ture,

ture, and of Providence, and of all thiings around us :
Andi ye~t, uponi examnination, it wyill. be foundi, that:
our views extend on every fide, juff as far as they
ought; andtlhat, to f~eeandl know\3 more thian is allow-
ed us, initead of brinlgilg' any adlvantage, 'ouldl~
produce certain misery*.--- We pry, for inflance,
with impatient curiolity, into fu~ture events. H-ap-
p~ily for us, th~ey ar~e veiled and covered up,; and one
peep behind that veil, were it: permlitted,, would be
fufficient to p~olfon thle whole comfort of our days,
by t be antic ipation of s~orrows to come.-Iln like man -
ner, we'often withl withl eagaernef~s to penetrate into
the secrets of nature, to look inito the invilible world,
and to be made acquainted with the whole defliny of
malcn. Our writh is denied ; wve are en~vironed on all
hands with myfl~ery ; and that m~yfiery is our happi-
nels:. For were thos~e great inviiible objefts fully
dikclofed, the fight of them would confoundi and
ovecrwthelm us. It wouldi eith~er totally derange our
feeble falculties ; or wouldt engross our attention to
fulch a degree, as to lay us aside from the business
and concer~ns of this wVorld. It wVould have the samp!
effeacc, as if we were carried away from the earth, and
mingled amnong the inlhabitants of s~ome other planet.
--Thie knowledlge that is allowed to us, was designed
to fit us for ading our part in our present slate. At
the exaat point, th~erefore, where ulefulnef~s ends,
knlowledge flops, and ignorance commences. Light
thlines upon us, as long as it se~rves to guide our path ;

not proper that this worldl thouldl prove a paradise to

-while the comlforts of life last, they are alwa rs mixed
wlith so~me troubles ; inr ordctr t·hat anl excelliveattac~h-

and no foch relaxation be introduced into govern-
ment, as might give licence or encouragement to
offe~nder~s. Accordinlgly, the moss admirable provi-
sion wyas mlade for these important purposes, by the
interposition of thle Son of God ifuffering and dying
for sinners. The sovereign awce of juffice is main-
tained, while juff-ice is tempered with mercy. Men
are bound to righteoufnelfs, under the higaheft fa~nc-
tions ; and ample s~ecurity and consolation are, at the
fame time, afforded to the penitent. By the inftruc-
tions, and example, of their Saviour, they are in-
firu~ted in their duty ; and through a Mediator and
`Intercessor, they are encouraged to offer their w~or--
thip an<; prayers to the Almighty. They are affixed
that, in wihatever is too arduous for human nature
to perform, they sh~all be afifted by a Divine Spirit;
and under all trials and difficuties, they ar~e fupporkg
edi by th~e exprefsr promis~e of that: et~ernal life, which
is brough~t to light by the golpel.--It: is not poffble
for the underflanding to conceive any method of fal,
vation, planned with more goodniels, and executed
with more wisd-om, than what is hlowvn in thie golpel
of Christ. Thle consideration or th~is conflitution
alone, gives us full reason to join in that exclama-
tion of the Apofiie : O tle depth of~tcer7idkes both of tlhe
crydom anzd thie knowledge" of God ! I~aw aferd~~~E·able

FR om this thortf Tiurvey which wle have takren of

Divinle Wifdlom-, as difo~overing itself,; in the whole,

complex frame of the moral world ; in the conflitu-
tion of human nature ; ini the governm~ent~ of humans·
affairs; andi in the redemption of the human race;
we cannot but perceive how much reason we have
to proffrate ourselves beifore God, and with all humi-
lity to worthipp and adore.--When we view that
imm~nenfe [truaure of the univers~e in which we dwell;
when we thinkr of Hlim, whose wisdom has planned
the whole fyfitem' of being; whose m-ind compre-
hends, whole counfrels direst, the whole course of
evenlts, from the beginning to the end of time, by
whom nothing is so, inconsiderable as to be overlook-
ed, or To transient as to be forgaotten ; who attends to
the concerns of the poor man in his cottage, while
he is fleering the fun and the moon in~ their course
through the heavens; into whrlat affonifhlment and
felf-annihilation do we fall! Before ]him all our
boasted kno-wledge is ignorance, and our wYifdom is
folly. Whtrever we cast our eyes on his works and
ways, we find all things adljuffed in nurmber', we~ighr,
and meajurle ; and after all that: we can survey, Lo !
there are bout a part of his ways; and howo/mall a porr-
tion2 is hear~d o~f him !

IT is the power of God, which produces among

the mutitude of men any impreilions of religion.
Wh1en thunder roars in the heavens, or an ear~thlquake
thakes the ground, they are fitruck with awre, and
difpiofed to worthip an invisible power. But su~ch
imprefio~ns of Deity are occasional, anld transit~ory.,
