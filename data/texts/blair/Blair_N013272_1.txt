Fore-runner of the approaching Doom of the World-the
Sun is darken'd, and the Trumpet Sound--the Ded
arie--and the Passions of the Good and Bad defcrib'd.

cum compage foluta

Secula tot mundi fuprema coegerit hora,
Antiquum repetens iterum chaos; omnia miflis
Sidera fideribus concurrent,

totaque difcors

Machina divulfi turbabit fadera mundi. L u c A N.
IDIH ILST others sing the various Chance of Arms,

i Resound their Monarch's Praise, orBeauty's Charms,

Bid thick'ning Squadrons Ihine in deep Array,
Contending Hosts, and rival Kings display;
Fierce in the Fields of Death a Hero :hew,
Rebuild fall'n Empires, and- old Time renew

B Or

Or sooth to gentle Notes, the falling Strain,
Paint Nature's Face, or sing the rural Plain;
Roam thro' the Earth, to Heaven's high Arch aspire,
And teach our Souls to glow with heavenly Fire.

Raptur'd! may I aTheme more lofty sing,

And stretch sublime to Heaven th'afpiring Wing;
Pregnant wiih dreadful Scenes, that fatal Day,,-
When flaming Vengeance melts the Ball away;
Nature's last gasping Agonies review,
The wak'ning Dead, and Judge descending shew;
Launch forth, and wide Eternity explore,
Where Bliss excessive reigns, -or fiery Billows roar.

0 Thou, whose Nod, superior and alone,

Ten Thousand Worlds revere and own thy Throne!
Inspire my Breast, and fire the raptur'd Lays,
And bid each tuneful Note thy Glories raie !
Thro' Trats unknown aflift the Muse to soar,
Paint Nature mould'ring, and old Time no more.
Upborn by Thee, surmount the Realms of Night,
And roam tih'-ethereal Fields divinely bright:
Serenely sing the Trumpet's awful Call,
And view serene thy Thunders wrap the Ball!

When now revolv'd the Length of Ages fly,
And in Fate's Record fixt, the Period's nigh;

Aloft

Aloft in Air then shall dread Signs appear,
And tell tl afrighted World its End is near.
Portentous Horrors then shall ihine on high,
And Hbfts entountring seem to lhake the Sky;
Wars in the troitbl'd Empyrean wage,
Aerial Squadrons close, and Hosts engage.
Comets shall then their fearful Signs display,
Portentous, Blaze intolerable Day!
O'er Climes aftonifhd shake the fatal Train,
And soar in Storms of Fire, deep fraught with Bane.

The Stars no more fhall:Heav'ns high Arch adorn,

Chear the dim Night,' and usher in the Morn;
But all eclips'd, their sickly Glories fade,
Or wing'd with Flame, desert th' expanded Shade.
Crush other Orbs,, on distant Spheres be hurl'd,
And into Chaos plunge-the reeling World.

Tinge'd with -:rimfon Hue, the Queen of Night,

Shall, weak ai"dpale, emit a dying Light:
Or chang'id t 'Blood, or dipt in sanguine Dye,
Glare diimiald'er the Earth and fable Sky,

Then whe ld at Noon dire&t in -flaming Ray,

Shines forth t'heSun, and all its Glories play.
A sudden Gloo~ the genial Orb- ihall veil,
And midnightD;:arknefs o'er the World prevail.

The

[43

The swelling Ocean burfis its ancient Bound,
And sudden Tremours shake the lab'ring Ground.
Internal Pangs convulse the Mountain's Womb,
And trembling Earth foretells th' approaching Doom.
Struck with Surprize, and trembling with Dismay,
Pale Mortals dread the Terrors of the Day.
Dire Consternation seizes ev'ry Breast;
All Strength is wither'd, and all Pride depreft.
Aghast and pale, they view the tott'ring Ball,
Expe& their Doom, and Silence rules o'er all.

Then, lo! at once- the flaming Portents cease,

Hufht are the jaring Elements in Peace;
Calm'd is the dread Confusion from- on high,
A momentary Silence fills the Sky.

'Tis Silence e'er the Scene begins to dawn,

The Mountains tremble, and the Vallies yawn:
At once the Trumpet's bellowing Thunder flies,
At once the Voice tremendous thakes the Skies;
Pours forth-its dreadful Note and piercing Sound,
From Pole to Pole the mighty Ecchoes bound.

Struck to the Center, staggering Nature reels,

Pangs yet unknown, the lab'ring Fabrick feels.'
Earth trembling heard-her hoary Mountains nod,
And own the Splendor of th'approaching God!

Old

Old Ocean heard its mountain Billows rife,
And heave their Bulk unweildy to the Skies.

With Consternation seiz'd, pale Mortals fly,

A frantick Fear glares in each guilty Eye;
Flulh'd with a conscious Shame, their Faces glow,
Above's a threatning Judge, and Hell and Flames below.

But hark ! the loud celestial Trumpet's Sound!

The Mountains eccho, and the Vales rebound!
Awake! awake-! th' inspired Trumpet cries,
Awake ! awake! the Eccho loud replies.
Next Judgment! Judgment! rends the yieldingAir,
For Judgment! Judgment! Sons of Mall prepare.

Rouz'd by the mighty Peal, the Dead arise, '

And shake th' oppreflive Slumber from their Eyes.
Wide yawn the Graves, and Death's pale Reign unfold!
Of shrouded. Myriads, dreadful to behold !-
More dreadful render'd by the glim'ring Ray,
Shot from the half-extinguifh'd Lamp of Day.

What did it serve in Tyrian Robes to glow,

And bright with circling Gems to crown the Brow?
Ador'd by Nations, fwell'd with Pride to stand,
And grasp th' unweildy Scepter in their Hand ?
Divested now of all these fading Toys,
What horrid Scenes their frighted Mind employs;

C Naked

[6]

Naked and trembling, now with wild Surprize,
They view around them all those Horrors rife.

O'er all the G6bK, th' awak'ning Clangor rolls,

O'er all the Globe, they pour in quick'ned Shoals: '-
Ev'n in th' Abyss where mighty'Waters sleep,. '
.Arrous'd-they hear,-and upwards cleave the Deep ;.
Struck by, the awful Soundj they instant rife
From Tracds of Death; and mingle in. the Skies.

But view yon wild Confusion from on High,-

From Clime to Clime, the fcatter'd'Fragmenits fly;
Members disjoin'd from distant Regions come,
And ev'ry_ Atom seeks its ancient Home:
In all the. Majesty of Life they hine;
Graceful swells forth the Frame, and walks divine.

Now blended in promifc'ous Throng appear,

Intent tr' irrevocable Doom to hear-:
If guilty .-' oh! what dismal Scenes:arife !
Present freih Horrors to their fick'ning Eyes;
Trembling with Fear, the naked Bosom glow.s,
Their outward Gestures paint their inward Woes;
Their Conscience all its gnawing Terrors darts,.
Intolerable Anguish wounds their Hearts:
With wild Affright their-glaring Eye-Balls stare,
Each Look is eloquent-of fell Despair.

The Works of Ages in a Moment end:
Vast Sheets of red'ning Blaze refulgent play,
On distant Kingdoms flai portentous Day!
'Midst all this Wreck of Worlds! the Jufr, serene
With pleasing Terror, view the awful Scene.
What heavenly Flame! what blest Emotions flow!
What pious Raptures in each Bosom glow!
Witli Seart elate the Just expe&t the Hour,
The Wicked bid the yawning Earth devour.

So

[8]

So when in Northern Seas the Winds arise,

And heave the dizzy Vefel to the Skies;
The Ship tormented, ftagg'ring reels around,
Sublime to Heav'n Ihe mounts, then finks profound;
Hangs on a Billow's Verge.- The ghastly Crew,
Loft in Amaze, surrounding Terrors view;
In evry Face a pale Deftra&ion's seen,
A frantick Fear runs fhiv'ring thro' their Mein.

Death, present Death, in each mad Wave they find,
And all their Sins crowd mighty on their Mind.

Oh! how much more! excessive more! must those
Who tand condemn'd to everlasting Woes,
Feel Pangs exceflive! Soul-tormenting Pain !
Fancy can't reach, or human Thought explain!

The Throne refulgent Streams thro' all the Air.

And heavenly Gems in great Profulion Ihone; :

Pure Amber there, and Saphires of the Sky,
And flaming Rubies glow'd with sanguine Dye;
Pure heavenly Light in purple Columns flow'd,
And-all the Throne with crowding Sun-Beams glow'd
In one bright Blaze, th' immortal Glories play,
And distant Worlds refle& furprizing Day:
Weak Fancy, plumes th'afpiring Wing in vain '-'
An heav'nly Theme demands a heav'nly Strain!

Around the Throne ten Thousand Forms divine,

Rang'd in bright File, in glitt'ring Splendor thine:
The Throne! the righteous Eye with blest Delight,
Its streaming Glories quite amaze the Sight;
With holy Rapture feasts on every Blaze,
With ravifh'd Soul on the Tribunal gaze;
With ardent With they long to hear their Fate,
And mingling Transports in each Bosom beat;
Longing to fee MESSIAH cleave the Sky,
Chide ling'ring Time, and upwards dart the Eye;
In Thought, his awful Majesty they view,
And fee serene, the Judge's threat'ning Brow.

They hear, or think they hear, the pleasing Sonds;'

Well done ye Faithful! in each Ear rebounds: .
In pleasing Fancy mount the Fields of Blifi,
Where Purity immingles Charms with-Peace;
And thus with glowing Ecifacy survey,
The grand Tribunal flash exhaustless Day. .

So, when a Traitor stands condeiin'd to iall,

Whirlwinds -and -rat'ing Storms his Way prepare,
And deep'ring Thunder speak th'approaching. Car!.
Myriads of Cherubs all around him throng; -

And in high Consort swel-l th'immortal Song.

Secure of Bliss, they view the Heav'ns Display,
And long to shine in everlaiting Day,

But on the Left, th' impious Crew is seen,

How wild their Looks! how haggard is their Mein!
Their gfilty Souls, ten Thousand Terrors wring,

Wide yawn the op'ning Gulphs of Hell below,
Around difblving Worlds, and fiery Billows.flow.

To bid their Souls in tender Meltings flow,
For Scenes of by-past Sin, and present Woe;

Too late bemoan. their Sins, and Life miEpent!

Gnathing the Teeth, and rattling of the Chain,

Why didit thou speak me into Misery,

' Why didft thou curse me with a second Frame,
' Rais'd from the Grave, to everlasting Pain ?

( Dread Sire! I've finn'd, 'tis just I feel thine Ire,

' But can't an Age of Misery attone,
' For a few'Years of Sin, so swiftly gone ?

But oh! these Pangs! oh! must they never end ?
' Still, still endure! and Thought's laftVerge transcend ?
' For ever ! oh! for ever must I dwell,

' But if in vain, I wish my Pangs may cease,
Then grant at least, one Hour, one Moment's Ease!
' One Drop of Water to allay this Pain,
' This mad'ning Fever in each boiling Vein!

Thus they with fervent Prayer, to grant, implore

That they, or all their Torments, be no more.
In vain o'erwhelm'd in Seas of fell Despair,
Exceflive Agonies their Bosoms tear!

Say, cou'd'ft thou, Caitif!. brave Almighty Ire,

And lie content, in everlasting Fire ?
With Fiends eternal, ever cou'dft thou dwell,

Must it be foP- and shall the fading Toy,:
The fleeting Dream of false deluding Joy:
The Flalh of Pleasure lasting for a Day,
Shall there, to eidlefs Rounds of Woe betray ?
For these, deluded Fool, your Soul resign .
To Flames, to Devils, and to Hell consign ?
The Hour, the fatal Hour Ihall haft'ning come,
That. hall for Ages fix the fatal Doom.
But Words are vain to fright; the Wretch will find
Hell's truer Image pi&ur'd in his Mind.

These Pangs exceflive, let the Wicked view,

Trace ev'ry Groan, and ev'ry Shriek pursue;
Behold the racking Pain, the twinging Smart,
The bleeding Anguiih of the tortur'd Heart!
Tremendous as they are: these Tortures view,
Then think ye Bad, this Hell is made for you ;
For you the fiery Chain, and Furnace glow,
And all the tort'ring Ministers of Woe.

No more d.e Sun's faint Rays the Day adorn,

Nor Evening Cynthia felils her Silver Horn:
No more dhe Day and Night alternate reign;
Nor Darkness foread o'er Heav''n her deep Domain
But G o D himself fhaill hine eternal Day,

From:Age to Age, the grateful Lay prolong,
And in rich Consort swell th'immortal Song:
Bid vast Immeifity his Praises found,
And wond'ring World thro' al their Spheres resound.

While thus they pour their Soul in ev'ry Lay,

And trace the pathless WondeN ds his:Ways ;
