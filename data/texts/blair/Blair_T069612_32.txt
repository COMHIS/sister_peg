roung men likewi/e exhort, to bebe-fber-minded,
SOBRIETY of mind is one of those

virtues which the present condition of

human life strongly inculcates. The un-
certainty of its enjoyments,checks pre-
fumption; the multiplicity of its dangers
demands perpetual caution. Moderation,
vigilance, and felf-government, are duties
incumbent on all; but especially on such
as are beginning the journey of life. To
them, therefore, the admonition in thz
Text is, with great propriety, directd;
though there is reason to fear, that by

A 3 them

them it is in hazard of being leaf re-
garded. Experience enforces the admo-
nition on the most giddy, after they have
advanced in years. But the whole state
of youthful views and paflions, is adverse
to sobriety of mind. The scenes which
present themselves, at our entering upon
the world, are commonly flattering. What-
ever they be in themselves, the lively fpi-
rits of the young gild every opening pro-
sped. The field of hope appears to stretch
wide before them. Pleasure seems to put
forth its blossoms on every fide. Impelled
by desire, forward they rush with inconfi-
derate ardour: Prompt to decide, and to
chufe; averse to hesitate, or to enquire;
credulous, because untaught by experience;
Taih, because unacquainted with danger;
headstrong, because unfubdued by difap-
pointment. Hence arise the perils, of
which it is my design at present to warn
them. I shall takefobriety of mind in its
most comprehensive sense, as including
the whole of that discipline which reli-
gion and virtue prescribe to youth. Though

the

7

the words of the Text are direEtly ad-
dressed to young men, yet, as the fame ad-
monition is given in a preceding verse to
the other sex, the inftrudions which arise
from the Text are to be confidered as
common to both. I intend, first, to {hew
them the importance of beginning early to
give serious attention to their condud;
and, next, to point out those virtues which
they ought chiefly to cultivate.

As soon as you are capable of reflection,

you must perceive that there is a right and
a wrong in human afions. You fee, that
those who are born with the fame advan-
tages of fortune, are not all equally prof-
perous in the course of life. While some
of them, by wife and steady conduct, at-
tain difinctlion in the world, and pass their
days with comfort and honour; others of
the fame rank, by mean and vicious beha-
viour, forfeit the advantag:s of their birth,
involve themselves in much misery, and
end in being a disgrace to their friends,
and a burden on society. Early, then,

A 4 yo(I

8

you may learn, that it is not on the ex-
ternal condition in which you find your-
selves placed, but on the part which you
are to a&, that your welfare or unhappi-
ness, your honour or infamy, depend.
Now, when beginning to ad that part,
what can be of greater moment, than to
regulate your plan of condud with the
most serious attention, before you have
yet committed any fatal or irretrievable
errors ? If, instead of exerting refleCtion
for this valuable purpose, you deliver your-
selves up at so critical a time, to sloth and
pleasure; if you refuse to liften to any
counsellor but humour, or to attend to any
pursuit except that of amusement; if you.
allow yourselves to float loose and careless
on the tide of life, ready to receive any
direction which the current of fashion
may chance to give you, what can you
expeCt to follow from such beginnings ?
While so many around you are undergoing
the fad consequences of a like indiscretion,
for what reason shall not those confe-
quences extend to you ? Shall you attain

success

9

success without that preparation, and es-
cape dangers without that precaution,
which is required of others ? Shall hap-
piness grow up to you, of its own accord,
and solicit your acceptance, when, to the
reft of mankind, it is the fruit of long
cultivation, and the acquisition of labour
and care ?-Deceive not yourfelvcs with
such arrogant hopes. Whatever be your
rank, Providence will not, for your fake,
reverse its eftablifed order. The Author
of your being hath enjoined you to take
heed to your ways; to ponder the paths of your
feet; to remember your Creator in the days of
your youth. He hath decreed, that they
only who seek after wifdonm Jiall find it;
that fools shall be fflicted becaufi of their
traf,'ref.ons; and that rwhoJb refi-e th in-
JlruitioniJhall deJtroy his own foul. By liften-
ing to these admonitions, and temper-
ing the vivacity of youth with a proper
mixture of serious thought, you may en-
sure cheerfulness for the reft of life; but
by delivering yourselves up at present to

gid-

10

giddiness and levity, you lay the found-
ation of lasting heaviness of heart.

When you look forward to those plans

of life, which either your circumstances
have suggested, or your friends have pro-
posed, you will not hesitate to acknow-
ledge that, in order to pursue them with
advantage, some previous discipline is re-
quifite. Be assured, that whatever is to
be your profeflion, no education is more
necessary to your success, than the ac-
quirement of virtuous dispositions and
habits. This is the universal preparation
for every character, and every station in
life. Bad as the world is, refpef is
always paid to virtue. In the usual course
of human affairs, it will be found, that
a plain understanding joined with ac-
knowledged worth, contributes more to
prosperity, than the brightest parts with-
out probity or honour. Whether science,
or business, or public life, be your aim,
virtue frill enters, for a principal share,
into all those great departments of society.

It

II

It is connected with eminence, in every
liberal art; with reputation, in every branch
of fair and useful business; with diftinc-
tion, in every public station. The vigour
which it gives the mind, and the weight
which it adds to chara&ctr; the generous
sentiments which it breathes, the undaunted
spirit which it inspires, the ardour of dili-
gence which it quickens, the freedom which
it procures from pernicious and difhlonour-
able avocations, are the foundations of all
that is high in fame, or great in success,
among men.

Whatever ornamental or engaging en-

dowments you now possess, virtue is a
necessary requisite, in order to their
shining with proper lustre. Feeble are
the attracions of the fairest form, if it
be fufpeted that nothing within corre-
fponds to the pleasing appearance without.
Short are the triumphs of wit, when it is
supposed to be the vehicle of malice. By
whatever arts you may at first attract the
attention, you can hold the eiteem, and
secure the hearts of others, only by ami-

able

12

able dispositions, and the accomplishments
of the mind. These are the qualities whose
influence will last, when the lustre of all
that once sparkled and dazzled has pafied.
away.

Let not then the season of youth be

barren of improvements so essential to
your future felicity and honour. Now is
the seed-time of life; and according to
what you sow, you fJall reap. Your cha-
rader is now, under Divine assistance, of
your own forming; your fate is, in some
measure, put into your own hands. Your
nature is as yet pliant and, soft. Habits
have not established their dominion. Pre-
judices have not pre-occupie'd your un-
derftanding. The world has not had time
to contract and debase your affeCtions.
All your powers are more vigorous, dif-
embarrassed, and free, than they will be
at any future period. Whatever impulse
you now give to your desires and passions,
the direEtion is likely to continue. It
will form the channel in which your life
is to run; nay, it may determine its ever-

lafiing

I3

lasting issue. Confider then the employ-
ment of this important period, as the
highefl trult which shall ever be com-
mitted to you; as, in a great measure,
decisive of your happiness, in time, and
in eternity. As in the succession of the
seasons, each, by the invariable laws of
Nature, affects the productions of what is
next in course; so, in human life, every
period of our age, according as it is well
or ill spent, influences the happiness of
that which is to follow. Virtuous youth
gradually brings forward accomplifled and
flourishing manhood; and such manhood
passes of itself, without uneasiness, into
refpetable and tranquil old age. But
when nature is turned out of its regular
course, disorder takes place in the moral,
just as in the vegetable world. If the
Spring put forth no blossoms, in Summer
there will be no beauty, and in Autumn
no fruit. So if youth be trifled away
without improvement, manhood will be
contemptible, and old age miserable. If
the beginnings of life have been vanity,

its

14

its latter end can be no other than vexation
of spirit.

Having thus shewn the importance of

beginning early to give serious attention
to conduct, I come, next, to point out the
virtues which are most necessary to be cul-
tivated in youth. What I shall,

I. RECOMMEND, is piety to God. With

this I begin, both as a foundation of good
morals, and as a disposition particularly
graceful and becoming in youth. To be
void of it, argues a cold heart, destitute of
some of the best affections which belong
to that age. Youth is the season of warm
and generous emotions. The heart should
then, spontaneously, rife into the admi-
ration of what is great, glow with the love
of what is fair and excellent, and melt at
the discovery of tenderness and goodness.
Where can any object be found, so proper
to kindle those affections, as the Father of
the universe, and the Author of all felicity ?
Unmoved by veneration, can you con-
template that grandeur and majesty, which

his

I5

lis works every where display? Untouched
by gratitude, can you view that profusion
of good, which, in this pleasing season of
life, his beneficent hand pours around
you ? Iappy in the love and affection of
those with whom you are conneced, look
up to the Supreme Being, as the inspirer
of all the friendship which has ever been
flewn you by others; himself, your best
and your first friends formerly, the sup-
porter of your infancy, and the guide of
your childhood; now, the guardian of
your youth, and the hope of your coming
years. View religious homage, as a na-
tural expression of gratitude to him for all
his goodness. Confider it as the service
of the God of your Fathers; of him, to
whom your parents .devoted you; of him,
who in former ages your ancestors ho-
noured; and by whom they are now
rewarded, and blessed in heaven. Con-
neded with so many tender sensibilities of
foul, let religion be with you, not the cold
and barren offspring of speculation, but

the

the warm and vigorous diaate of the
heart.

But though piety chiefly belong to the

heart, yet the aid of the underltanding is
requisite, to give a proper diretion to the
devout affections. You muff endeavour,
therefore, to acquire just views, both of
the great principles of natural religion,
and of the peculiar dotrines of the Gof-
pel. For this end, study the sacred Scrip-
tures. Consult the word of God, more
than the systems of men, if you would
know the truth in its native purity. When,
upon rational and fober enquiry, you have
eftablifled your principles, susser them
not to be fliaken by the scoffs of the licen-
tious, or the cavils of the sceptical. Re-
member, that in the examination of every
great and comprehensive plan, such as that
of Christianity, difficulties may be expeted
to occur; and that reasonable evidence is
not to be rejeced, because the nature of
our present slate allows us only to know
ib part, and to fee thjrough a glass, darkly.

Impress

I7

Impress your minds with reverence for

all that is sacred. Let no wantonness of
youthful spirits, no compliance with the
intemperate mirth of others, ever betray
you into prophane rallies. Besides the
guilt which is thereby incurred, nothing
gives a more odious appearance of petu-
lance and prcfumption to youth, than the
affecation of treating religion with levity.
InfRead of being an evidence of superior
undlerftanding, it discovers a pert and
shallow mind; which, vain of the firil
smatterings of knowledge, presumes to
make light of what the reft of mankind
revere.

At the fame time you are not to ima-

gine, that when exhorted to be religious,
you are called upon to become more for-
mal and solemn in your manners than
others of the fame years, or to eret your-
selves into supercilious reprovers of those
around you. The spirit of true religion
breathes gentleness and affability. It gives
a native, unaffected ease to the behaviour.
It is social, kind, and cheerful; far re-

B moved

moved from that gloomy and illiberal fu-
perftition which clouds the brow, fiarpens
the temper, dejets the spirit, and teaches
men to fit themselves for another world,
by negleting the concerns of this. Let
your religion, on the contrary, connet
preparation for heaven, with an honour-
able discharge of the duties of afive life.
Let it be associated in your imagination
with all that is manly and useful; with
whattfoever things are true, are jujf, are pire,
are lovely, are of good report, wherever there
is any virtue, and wherever there is any
praise. Of such religion discover, on every
proper occasion, that you are not ashamed;
but avoid making any unnecessary often-
tation of it before the world.

II. To piety, join modesty and doci-

lity, reverence of your parents, and sub-
miflion to those who are your superiors
in knowledge, in :iation, and in years.
Dependence and obedience belong to
youth. Modesty is one of its.chief orna-
ments; and has ever been esteemed a pre-

sage

I')

sage of rising merit. When enielrin.r on
the career of life, it is your part, not to
assume the reins as yet into your hands;
but to commit yourselves to the guidance
of the more experienced, and to become
wife by the wisdom of those who have
gone before you.

Of all the follies incident to youth,

there are none which are either deform its
present appearance, or blast the ,profped
*of its future prosperity, more than self-
conceit, presumption, and obstinacy. By
checking its natural progress in improve-
ment, they fix it in long immaturity;
and frequently produce mischiefs, which
can never be repaired. Yet these are vices
too commonly found among the young.
Big with enterprise, and elated by hope,
they resolve to trust for success to none
but themselves. Full of their own abili-
ties, they deride the admonitions which
are given them by their friends, as the
'timorous fuggeifions of age. Too wil:
to learn, too impatient to deliberate, too

B 2 fo.r-~

20

forward to be restrained, they plunge,
with precipitant indiscretion, into the
midst of all the dangers with which life
abounds. Seet thoou a young man wife in
his own conceit? There is more hope of a
fool, than of hin.-Pofitive as you now are
in your opinions, and confident in your
assertions, be assured, that the time ap-
proaches when both men and things will
appear to you in a different light. Many
chara&ers which you now admire, will,
by and by, fink in your esteem; and
many opinions, of which you are at pre-
sent most tenacious, will alter as you ad-
vance in years. Distrust, therefore, that
glare of youthful presumption, which
dazzles your eyes. Abound not in your
own sense. Put not yourselves forward
with too much eagerness; nor imagine,
that by the impetuosity of juvenile ar-
dour, you can overturn systems which
have been long established, and change
the face of the world. Learn not to think

3ore highly of yourselves than you ought to

think,

think, tut to thirk fbcrly. By patient and
gradual progreftlon in improvement, you
may, in due time, command lasting esteem.
But by assuming, at present, a tone of fu-
periority, to which you have no title, you
will difgufl those whose approbation it is
molt important to gain. Forward vivacity
may fit you to be the companions of an idle
hour. Alore solid qualities must recom-
mend you to the wife, and mark you out
for importance and consideration in fubfe-
quent life.

III. IT is neceflary to recommend to

you, sincerity and truth. This is the
basis of every virtue. That darkness of
charaaer, where we can fee no heart;
those foldings of art, through which
no native affection is allowed to penetrate,
present an objec, unamiable in every
season of life, but particularly odious in
youth. If, at an age when the heart is
warm, when the emotions are strong,
and when nature is expected to shew it-
self free and open, you can already finile

B 3 and

and deceive, what are we to look for
when you {hall be longer hackneyed in the
ways of men; when interest shall have
completed the obduration of your heart, and
experience {hall have improved you in all
the arts of guile? Dissimulation in youth,
is thc fore-runner of perfidy in old age. Its
first appearance is the fatal omen of grow-
ing depravity, and future flame. It de-
grades parts and learning; obscures the
lustre of every accomplifihment; and finks
you into contempt with God and man.

As you value, therefore, the approba-

tion of Heaven, or the esteem of the
world, cultivate the love of'truth. In all
your proceedings, be direc and consistent..
Ingenuity and candour possess the most
powerful charm; they bespeak universal
favour, and carry an apology for almofl
every failing. The lip cf truth Jhall be
e/fabliPed for ever; but a lyig tongue is
but fr a moment*. The path of truth, is
a plain and a safe path; that of falsehood,
is a perplexing maze. After the fii'ft de-

Prov. xii. 19.

parture

parture from sincerity, it is not in your
power to flop. One artifice unavoidably
leads on to another ; till, as the intricacy
of the labyrinth increases, you are left
(ntangled in your own filare. Deceit dif-
covcrs a little mind, which flops at tem-
porary expedients, without rising to com-
prchenfive views of conduCi. It betrays,
at the tfme time, a dabltrdly spirit. It
is the resource of one who wants courage
to avow his designs, or to reft upon him-
self. Whereas, opclncfs of character dif-
plays that generous boldncfs which ought
to distinguish youth. To set out in thl
worid with no other principle than ;i
crafty attention to intcreft, betokens on-
who is destined for creeping tirough the
inferior walks of life. But to give an
early preference to honour above gain,
when they stand in competition; to despise
every advantage, which cannot be attained
without diflioneft arts; to brook no mean-
ness, and to stoop to no diffim!:ation ; are
the indications of a great mind, the pre-
fages of future eminence and diftindion
in life..

B 4 At

24

At the fame time this virtuous sincerity

is perfectly confiitent with the most pru-
dent vigilance and caution. It is opposed
to cunning, not to true wisdom. It is not
the simplicity of a weak and improvident,
but the candour of an enlarged and noble
mind; of one who scorns deceit, because
he accounts it both base and unprofitable;
and who seeks no disguise; because he
needs none to hide him. Lord! ivjo/hall
abide in thy tabernacle? Who y.iall ascend
into thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly
and worketh righteotunefs, and fpeaketh th.e
truth in his heart.

IV. YOUTH is the proper season of

cultivating the benevolent and humane
affections. As a great part of your hap-
piness is to depend on the connexions
which you form with others, it is of high
importance that you acquire, betimes, the
temper and the manners which will ren-
der such connexions comfortable. Let a
sense of justice be the foundation of all
your social qualities. In your most early
intercourse with the world, and even in

your

25

your youthful amusements, let no unfair-
ncfs be found. Engrave on your mind
that sacred rule, of doing all t/ings to
others, according as you 'j/h that they
Jlould do unto you. For this end, impress
yourselves with a deep sense of the origi-
nal and natural equality of men. What-
ever advantages of birth or fortune you
possess, never display them with an often-
tatious superiority. Leave the fubordina-
tions of rank, to regulate the intercourse of
more advanced years. At present, it be-
comes you to at among your companions,
as man with man. Remember how un-
known to you are the viciflitudes of the
world; and how often they, on whom ig-
norant and contemptuous young men once
looked down with scorn, have risen to be
their superiors in future years.

Compaflion is an emotion of which

you ought never to be aflamed. Grace-
ful in youth is the tear of sympathy, and
the heart that melts at the tale of woe.
Let not ease and indulgence contrat your
affections, and wrap you up in selfish en-

joyment.

26

joyment. But go sometimes to the horife
of mourning, as well as to the hoife of feafi-
ing. Accustom yourselves to think of the
distresses of human life; of the solitary
cottage, the dying parent,. and the weeping
orphan. Thou Jhalt not harden thy heart,
nor Jhut thy hand from thy poor brother;
but thou Jhalt fiurely give unto him in the
day of his need: And thine heart Jpall not
be grieved when thou grievi unto him ; be-
cause that for this thing, the Lord thy God
Jhall bless thee in all thy works-. Never
sport with pain and distress, in any of your
amusements; nor treat even the meanest
insea with wanton cruelty.

In young minds, there is commonly a

strong propensity to particular intimacies
and friendship. Youth, indeed, is the
season when friendships are sometimes
formed, which not only continue through
succeeding life, but which glow to the
]aft, with a tenderness unknown to the
connexions begun in cooler years. The
propensity therefore is not to be difcou-
raged; though at the fame time it must

* Deut. xv, 7. 10. be

27

be regulated with much circumfpeaioii
and care. Too many of the pretended
friendfliips of youth, are mere combina-
tions in pleasure. They are often found-
ed on capricious likings; suddenly con-
trated, and as suddenly diflblved. Some--
times they are the effet of interested com-
plaifance and flattery on the one fide, and
of credulous fondness on the other. Be-
ware of such rafli and dangerous con-
nexions, whicli may afterwards load you
with dishonour. Remember, that by the
characer of those whom you choose for
your friends, your own is likely to be
formed, and will certainly be judged of
by the world. Be flow, therefore, and
cautious in contraating intimacy; but
when a virtuous friendship is once efca-
blifhed, confider it as a sacred engagement.
Expose not yourselves to the reproach of
lightness and inconstancy, which always
bespeak, either a trifling or a base mind.
Reveal'none of the fccrets of your friend.
Be faithful to his interests. Forsake him
not in danger. Abhor the thought of ac-

quiring

28

quiring any advantage by his prejudice or
hurt. There is a friend that lovI'th at all
times, and a brother that is bIrn for adver-
fity. Thine own friend, and thy father's
friend, forsake not*.

Finally, on this head; in order to ren-

der yourselves amiable in society, correq
every appearance of harfinefs in beha-
viour. Let that courtesy distinguish your
demeanour, which springs, not so much
from studied politeness, as from a mild
and gentle heart. Follow the customs of
the world in matters indifferent; but stop
when they become sinful. Let your man-
ners be simple and natural; and of course
they will be engaging. Affecation is cer-
tain deformity. By forming themselves
on fantaflic models, and vying with one
another in every reigning folly, the young
begin with being ridiculous, and end in
being vicious and immoral.

V. LET me particularly exhort youth to
temperance in pleasure: Let me admonifli

* Prov. xvii, 17.-xxvii. Io,

then

29

them to beware of that rock on which
thousands, from race to race, continue to
split. The love of pleasure, natural to man
in every period of his life, glows at this age
with exceffivc ardour. Novelty adds fresh
charms, as yet, to every gratification. The
world appears to spread a continual feast;
and health, vigour, and hilh spirits,
invite them to partake of it without
restraint. In vain we warn them of latent
dangers. Religion is accused of infuffer-
able severity, in prohibiting enjoyment;
and the old, when they offer their admo-
nitions, are upbraided with having forgot
that they once were young.--And yet,
my friends, to what do the restraints of
religion, and the counsels of age, with
refped to pleasure, amount ? They may
all. be comprised in few words, not to
hurt yourselves, and not to hurt others,
by your pursuit of pleasure. Within these
bounds, pleasure is lawful; beyond them,
it becomes criminal, because it is ruinous.
Are there restraints any other, than what

a wife

2 wife man would choose to inmpofe on
himself ? We call you not to renounce plea-
sure, but to enjoy it in safety. Instead of
abridging it, we exhort you to pursue it on
an extensive plan. We propose measures
for securing its pofleffion, and for pro-
longing its duration.

Consult your whole nature. Confider

yourselves not only as sensitive, but as
rational beings; not only as rational, but
social; not only as social, but immortal.
Whatever violates your nature in any of
these refpeats, cannot afford true pleasure;
any more than that which undermines an
essential part of the vital system can pro-
mote health. For the truth of this conclu-
sion, we appeal, not merely to the autho-
rity of religion, nor to the testimony of the
aged, but to yourselves and your own ex-
perience. We ask, Whether you have not
found, that in a course of criminal excels,
your pleasure was more than compensated
by succeeding pain ? Whether, if not from
every particular instance, yet from every

habit,

habit, at least of unlawful gratification,
there did not spring some thorn to wound
you, there did not arise some consequence
to make you repent of it in the iffie ?
How long then, yefimple ones ! will ye love
simplicity ? How long repeat the fame
round of pernicious folly, and tamely ex-
pose yourselves to be caught in the fame
snare ? If you have any confidration, or
any firmness left, avoid temptations, for
which you have found yourselves un-
equal, with as much care, as you would
flhun pestilential infedtion. Break off all
connexions with the loose and profligate.
When finners entice thee, consent thou not.
Look not on the wine when it is red, when
it giveth its colour in the cup ; for at the
lajt, it biteth like a serpent, and jlingeth
like an adder. Remove thy way from the
Jlrange woman, and come not near the door
of her house. Let not thine heart incline
to her ways; for her house is the uway to hell.
Thou goes after her as a bird hafleth to the
filare, and knoweth not that it is for his

By these unhappy excesses of irregular

pleasure in youth, how many amiable
dispositions are corrupted or destroyed!
How many rising capacities and powers
are suppressed! How many flattering
hopes of parents and friends are totally
extinguished! Who but must drop a tear
over human nature, when he beholds that
morning which arose so bright, overcast
with such untimely darkness; that good
humour which once captivated all hearts,
that vivacity which sparkled in every
company, those abilities which were fitted
for adorning the highest station, all fa-
crificed at the shrine of low sensuality;
and one who was formed for running the
fair career of life in the midst of public
esteem, cut off by his vices at the begin-
ning of his course, or funk, for the whole
of it, into insignificancy and contempt!-
These, O sinful Pleasure! are thy trophies.
It is thus that, co-operating with the foe
of God and man, thou degradeft human
hbnour, and blafteft the opening profpeats
Qof human felicity.

VI. DILI-

33

VI. DILIGENCE, industry, and proper

improvement of time, are material duties
of the young. To no purpose are they
endowed with the best abilities, if they
want activity for exerting them. Un-
availing, in this cafe, will be every di-
retion that can be given them, either for
their temporal or spiritual welfare. In
youth the habits of industry are most
easily acquired. In youth, the incen-
tives to it are strongest, from ambition
and from duty, from emulation and hope,
from all the profpets which the begin-
ning of life affords. If, dead to these
calls, you already languish in slothful
inaction, what will be able to quicken
the more fluggifl current of advancing
years ?

Industry is not only the instrument of

improvement, but the foundation of plea-
sure. Nothing is so opposite to the true
enjoyment of life, as the relaxed and
feeble state of an indolent mind. He
who is a firanger to industry, may pof-
fess, but he cannot enjoy. For it is la-

c bour

34

ibour only which gives the relish to plea-
sure. It is the appointed vehicle of every
good to nian. It is the indispensable
condition of our possessing a found mind
in a found body. Sloth is so incon-
fiftent with both, that it is hard to de-
termine whether it be a greater foe to
virtue, or to health and happiness. In-
acive as it is in itself, its effeas are
fatally powerful Though it appear a
slowly flowing stream, yet it undermines
all that is stable and flourifiing. It not
only saps the foundation of every virtue,
but pours upon you a deluge of crimes
and evils. It is like water which first
putrifies by stagnation, and then fends up
noxious vapours, and fills the atmosphere
with death.

Fly, therefore, from idleness, as the

certain parent both of guilt and of ruin.
And under idleness I include, not mere
inaction only, but all that circle of
trifling occupations, in which too many
saunter away their youth; perpetually
engaged in frivolous society, or public

amuse-

35

amusements, in the labours of dress, or
the ostentation of their persons. Is this
the foundation which you lay for future
usefulness and esteem ? By such accom-
pli{hments, do you hope to recommend
yourselves to the thinking part of the
world, and to answer the expecations of
your friends, and your country ?-Amuse-
ments, youth requires. It were vain, it
were cruel to prohibit them. But though
allowable as the relaxation, they are most
culpable as the business, of the young.
For they then become the gulph of time,
and the poison of the mind. They so-
ment bad passions. They weaken tle
manly powers. They fink the native
vigour of youth, into contemptible effe-
minacy.

Redeeming your time from such danl-

gerous waste, seek to fill it with employ-
ments which you may review with satis-
facion. The acquisition of knowledge
is one of the most honourable occupa-
tions of youth. The desire of it disco-
vers a liberal mind, and is connected with

c 2 many.

36

many accomplishments, and many virtues.
But though your train of life flould not
lead you to study, the course of education
always furnishes proper employments to a
well-difpofed mind. Whatever you pursue,
be emulous to excel. Generous ambition,
and sensibility to praise, are, especially at
your age, among the marks of virtue.
Think not, that any affluence of fortune,
or any elevation of rank, exempts you from
the duties of application and industry. In-
duftry is the law of our being; it is the
demand of Nature, of Reason, and of God.
Remember always, that the years which
now pass over your heads, leave perma-
nent memorials behind them. From your
thoughtless minds they may escape; but
they remain in the remembrance of God.
They form an important part of the register
of your life. They will hereafter bear tefti-
mony, either for or against you, at that
day, when, for all your actions, but parti-
cularly for the employments of youth, you
must give an account to God.

THus I have set before you some of the

chief qualifications which belong to that
fiber mind, that virtuous and religious cha-
rader, which the Apostle in my Text
recommends to youth; piety, modesty,
truth, benevolence, temperance, and in-
duftry. Whether your future course is
destined to be long or fiort, after this man-
ner it should commence; and, if it con-
tinue to be thus conduced, its conclusion,
at what time soever it arrives, will not be
inglorious or unhappy. For honourablc age
is not that which Jlandeth in length of tinm,
or that which is meafiured by nulbetr of years.
But vifdoin is the grey hair to man, and ai
uiifpstted life is old age.

LET me finish the subjec, with recalling

your attention to that dependance on the
blessing of Heaven, which, amidst all your
endeavours after improvement, you ought
continually to preserve. It is too common
with the young, even when they resolve to
tread the path of virtue and honour, to set
out with presumptuous confidence in thcm-

felvcs.

38

selves. Trutfing to their own abilities for
carrying them successfully through life,
they are careless of applying to God, or of
deriving any afliftance from what they are
apt to reckon the gloomy discipline of reli-
gion. Alas ! how little do they know the
dangers which await them ? Neither hu-
man wisdom, nor human virtue, unfup-
ported by religion; are equal to the trying
situations which often occur in life. By
the shock of temptations how frequently
have the most virtuous intentions been
overthrown ? Under the pressure of difaf-
ter, how often has the greatest constancy
funk ? Every good, and every perfeR gift,
is from above. Wisdom and virtue, as well
as riches and honour, come from God. Def-
fitute of his favour, you are in no better
situation, with all your boasted abilities,
than orphans left to wander in a trackless
desert, without any guide to conduct them,
or any shelter to cover them from the ga-
thering storm. Corret, then, this ill-
founded arrogance. Expec not, that your
happiness can be independent of him who

made

39

made you. By faith and repentance, ap-
ply to the Redeemer of the world. By
piety and prayer, seek the protecion of the
God of heaven. I conclude with the solemn
words, in which a great Prince delivered
his dying charge to his son; words which
every young person ought to confider as
addressed to himself, and to engrave deeply
on his heart: Thou, Solomon, nmyfoin, know
thou the God of ihy fathers; and serve him
with a perfect heart, and with a willing
mind. For the Lord fearcheth all hearts,
and underftandeth all the inaginations of the
thoughts. If thou seek him, he will be found
of thee; but if thou foifake him, he will cajl
thee ofor ever
