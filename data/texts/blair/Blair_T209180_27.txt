Bbieth etrnmity, dwroelleth alo wreith him that -.

inidRt of his glory, the Almighty is not

Neither obs~curity of Ration, nor im~perfec-

S E R 1%[ r~egard, who worthip and obey him. Every
i< prayer which they f~end up from their fe-

cret retirements, is liff~ened to by him ,
and every work of charity which they per-
form, howy unknown soever to the world,
attraLCs his notice. The Text pres~ents a
single inflance of this comfortable truth.
InI the city of Caesarea, there dwelt a
Roman centurion, a milita'ry Officer of
inferior rank, a Gentile, neither byr
birth nor religion entitled to the privi-
leges of the Jewith nation. But he was a
devout and a benevolent man; who, ac-
cording to his measure of religious know-
ledge, fludied to perform his duty, prayed
to God alwa~rys, and gave murchalms to the
poplpie. Such a charadter pass~ed not un-
observed by God. So) highly was it ho-
noured, that to this good centurion an
Angel was se~nt from heaven, in order to
d~iredf him to thie means of full infiruc-
tion in the truth. The Angel accoffs him
with this sal~utation, Cornelius, 'hy prayper'sl
and thine alms are come urp for a memorial
btfore Goa'

It is to the conjundion of prayersS and sER M.

alms, that I purpoi-e now to dired your ij
thoughts, as defecribing the refpeatable
and amiable charadter of a manr, as form-
ing the honour and the blessedness of a
true Christian; piety joined with charity,
faith wiith good works, devotion with mo-
rality. These are thinlgs which God hath
connedted, and which it is impious in
man to s~eparate. It is only when they
remain united, that they can come up as
a grateful memorialbe~fore God. I thall first
endeavour to thow you, That alms vwith-
out prayers, or prayers without alms, mo-
rality without devotion, or devotion with-
out morality, are extremely defeative;
and then shall point out the happy effeAs
of their mutual union.

Let us begin with considering the cafe

of alms without prayers ; that is, of good
works without piety, or a proper sense
of God and religion. Examples of this
are not uncommon in the world. W~ith
many, Virtue is, or at least is pretended

B 2 to

SER M. to be, a refpeaable and ari honoutedj

~I name, while Piety founds meanly in their

ears. They are men of the world, and
they claim to be men of honour. They
i-eft upon their humanity, their public
spirit, their probity, and their truth.
They arrogate to themselves all the manly
and the adive virtues. But devout affec-r
tions, and religious duties, they treat with
contempt, as founded on thadowy f~pecu-
lations, and fit to employ the attention
only of weak and fuperiitious minds.
Now, in opposition to s~uch persons, I
contend, That this negledt of piety ar-
gues depravity of heart; and that it in-
~fers an irregular discharge of the duties of
morality.

FIa sT, It argues internal depravity ,

for it discovers a cold and a hard heart.
If there be any imprefilon which man is
formed by nature to receive, it is a s~ens~e
of religion. Als soon as his mind opens
to observation and refleaion,_ he dis~cerns
innumerable marks of his dependent £1ate.

He

He finds himself placed, by some s~uper SER M.
rior power, in a vast world, where the Lv
w~isdom and goodnes~s of the Creator .are
conspicuous on every fide. The magni-
ficence, the bea~uty and order of nature,
excite him to admire and adore. ~When
he lookss up to that omnipotent hand
which operates throughout the universe,
he is impressed with reverence. When
he receives blefirngs which he cannot
avoid as~cribing to divine goodnes~s, he is
prompted to gratitude. The exprefiions
of those affeations u~nder the various forms
of religious worthip, are no other than
native effhfions of the human heart. Ig-
norance may mislead, and f~uperflition may
corrupt them; but their origin is derived
from sentiments that are essential to man.

Cast your eyes over the whole earth.

Explore the most remote quarters of the
east or the weft. You may disc~over tribes
~of men, without policy, or laws, or cities,
or any of the arts of life: But no where
will you find them without some form of
religion. In every region you behold the

proffrate

SETR M profiate wolrthipper, the temple, the al-

1ta~r, and the offering. Wherever men have

existed, they have been sensible that some
acknowledgment was due, on their part,
to the Sovereign of the world. If in their
rudest and most ignorant slate, this obli-
gation has been felt, what additional force
must it acquire by the improvements of
human knowledge, but efrpecially by the
great: discoveries of the Christian revela-
tion? W hatever, either from reverence or
from gratitude, can excite men to the
worthip of God, is by this revelation:
placed. in s~uch a light, as one thould
think were f~ufficient to over-awe the most
thoughtles~s and to melt the most obdurate
mi nd.

Canst thou, then, pretend to be a man

of reason, nay, a man of virtue, and yet
continue regardlels of one of the first and
chief dietates of human natu're ? Where
is thy sensibility to what is right and fit,
if that loud voice wrhich calls all nations
throughout the earth to religious homage,
has never been he~ard by thee ? Or, if it

has

hias been heard, by w~hat firange and fals~e s ER M.
refinements haft thou fified thos~e natural
f'entimrents which it tends to awaken ?
Calling thyself a son, a citizen, a friend;
claiming to be faithful and affeationate
in there relations; haft thou no fenfi~e of
what thou oweft to thy first Parent, thy
highest Sovereign, thy greatea Benefac-
tor ? Can it be consistent wijth true virtue
or honour, to value thyself upon thy re-
gard to inferior obligations, and yet to
violate that w~hich is the most s~acred and
the moss ancient of all? Wrhen simple in-
flind teaches the Tartar and the Indian,
together with his alms and good works to
join his prayers to that Power whom he
considers as the source of good, thall it be
no reproach·, in the most enlightened slate
of humnan nature, and under the purest
dis~pensation of religion, to have extin-
guifhed the s~ense of gratitude to Heaven,
and to flight all acknowledgment of the
great and the true God~ ?What does fach
condua imply, but either an entire want
or a wilful f~upprefiion, of some of the best

and ~~S?

S ER M . and most generous affe~tions belonging to

I human nature ?-Surely, there muff be

an effrential defeat in that heart which re-
mains cold and infCenfible, where it ought
to be affeaed most warmly. Surely, Auch
a degree of depravity must be lodged there
as is fufficient: to taint all the other springs
of pretended virtue.

BUTr besides this, I muff contend, i~ix

the second place, that where religion is
neglea~ed, there can be no regular nor
fleady pradice of the duties of moralrity.
The charad~er wrill be often inconfiffent;
and Virtue, placed on a basis too narrow
to support it, wi'll be always loose and
tottering. For such is the propensity of
our nasure to vice, so numerous are the
temptations to a felaxed and immoral
conduEt, that fironger restraints than
those of mere reas~on, are necessary to be
impoofed on man. The sens~e of right and
wrong; the principle of honour, or the
inflinat of benevolence, are barriers too
feeble to withfland the firength of pafiron.

In the tranquil seasons of life, these natu- 8 E RM.
ral principles may, perhaps, carry on the L-rc
ordinary course of fobcial duties with some
regularity. · But wait until some trying
emergence come. Let the conflia . of
pafl~ions arise~. Let the heart be either
wounded by fore diitrefs, or agitated by
violent emotions; and you thall presently
fee, that virtue without religion is inade-
quate to the government of life. It is de-
flitute of its proper guard, of its firmest
s~upport, of its chief encouragement. It
will fink under the weight of misfo~rtune;
or will yield to the solicitation of guilt.

The great motives that: produce con`-

flancy and firmness of aaion, muflt be of a
palpable and firiking kinid. A divine Le-
giflator, uttering his voice from heaven;
an omniscient Witness, beholding us in
all our retreats; an almighty Governor
firetching forth his arm to punish or re-
ward, difcloiing the secrets of the invisible
world, informing us of perpetual reft pre-
pared hereafter for the righteous, and of
indagnation and wrath awa iti ngthe wicked :

There~

S E R M. Ther-e are the considerations which over-

Icy-~awe the world, which support integrity,

and check guilt. They add to virtue that
s~olemnity which thould ever chara~terize
it. To the admonitions of conrcience they
give the authority of a law. Co-operating
with all the good difpolitions of a pious
man, they firengthen and insure their in-
fluence. On his alms you can have no
certain dependance, who thinks not of
God, nor has joined prayer to his cha-
ritable deeds. But when humanity is fe-
conded by piety, the sp~rin~g from which
It flows is rendered, of course, more re-
gular and conftant.-Iln thort, withdraw
religion, and you thake all the pillars of
morality. Ini every heart you weaken the
i~nfluence of virtue . And among the mul-
titude, the bulk of mankind, you over-
throw; its power.

7HAvINGy thus thewn that morait-y

without devotion is both defeitive and
unflable, I proceed to confider the other
extreme, of prayers without alms, devo-
tion without mor~ality.

In every age the pradice has prevailed, st Rivt

ofrubfti-tuting certain appearances of piety c~
in the place of the great duties of huma-
n~ity and mercy. Too many there have
always been, who flatter themselves with
the hope of obtaining; the friendship of
their Crea tor, though they negled to do
juffice to their fellow-creatures. But s~uch
persons may be aff'ured, that their fu ppofe~d
piety is altogether of a s~purious kind. It
is an invention of their own, unknown to
reason, unknown in the word of God. In
s~cripture we are ever direatedi to try our
faith by our works, our love of God by our
love of men. We are direated to confider
piety as a principle which regenerates the
heart, and forms it to goodness. We are
taught, that in vain we address any a~s of
homage to Christ, unless we do thbe things
·which hbe jaith ; and that loue, peace, gen-
t/ene/s~, goodness, m~eekness and tempnerance

the native frui'ts If hpis fpiit *. If, there-

SER M. fore, while piety feemns ardent, morality

~--~ hall decline, you have full reason to be-

lieve that into that piety fonze corrupting
ingredients have entered. And if ever
your regard to morality thall totally fail;
if, while you make many prayers, you
give no alms ; if, while you appear to be
zrealous for God, you are fals~e or un~just to
men a if you are hard or contraded in
heart, s~evere in your cedrures, and opprefi-
five in your condua; then, conclude with
certainty, that what you had termed piety
wnas no more than an empty name. For
as soon, according to the feripture limili-
tude, will bitter waeters sow rfrom a/weet
Jountain, as fuxch effees ·be produced by
genumne piety.

W~hat: you have calle~d by that name,

resolves itself into one or other of three
things. Eitherit is a hypocritical form
of godliners~, afirumed in order to impof~ie
on th-e w~orld; or which is the most fhi-
vourable su~pposition, it is a transient im-
prefilon of se~riousness, an accide~ntal melt-
ing of the heart, which pafes nawany like

the

the monring cloud and the early dew ; or, SER M.
which I am afraid is too often the cafe~,
it is the deliberate refuge of a. deluded
and s~uperstitious, but at the f~ame time
a corrupted nriind. For all men, even the
most depraved, are f~ubjeAt more or less,
to compunetions of cons~cience. It has
never been in their power to withdraw
totally beyond the reach of that warning
voice, which tells them that s~omething is
necefr~ary: to be done, in order to make
their peace with thei Ruler of the world.
But, backward at the flame time to resign
the gains of diihonefly, or the pleasu~res
of vice; avers~e from fCubmitiTon to that
sacred law which enjoins righteoufunefs
in its whole extent, they have often at-
tempted to make a fort of composition
with heaven ; a composition, which,
though they dare not avow it in words,
lurks in 'iecret at the bottom of many a
heart. If God will only dispens~e with
some articles of obedience, they will re-
pay him with abundant hornage. If they
fail in good praatice, they will fludy to

E ER M. be found in belief ; and, by the miimber of
~-J their prayers, will atone, in fame meas~ure

for their deficiency in charitable deeds.

But the attempt is as vain, as it is im-

pious. From the simplest and plainest
principles of reason it must appear, 'that
religious worthip, disjoined from justice
and virtue, can upon no account what-
eve~r find acceptance with the Supreme
Being. 'To wthat pulrpofe is th5e multitude
of your facryces unto me? fz ithf~ the Lord.
Bring no mor vlazin oblations. Incense isan

m~eeting-s *.-C--ease- , foolish and impious
man ! Cease to confider the Almighty as
a w-eak or vain-glorious being, who is to
be appeas~ed by thy devout proffrations,
an1d thy humcble words , or to be gratified
by the parade and ostentation of ext~ernal
worship. Wihat. is all thy wvorthip to him?

upon his account, that thou mighteft -C3
bring any increase to his glory and feli-
city by thy weak and jinignificant praires ?
Sooner mighteft thou increase~ the f~plen-
dour of the fun by a lighted taper, or add
to the thunder by thy voice. No: It is
for the fa~ke of man not of God, that:
worthip and prayers are required; not that
God may be rendered more glorious, but
that man may be made better; that he may
be confirmed in a proper sens~e of his de--
pendent slate, and acquire those pious and
virtuous difpolitions in which his highest
improvement consists.

Of all the principles in religion, one

thould take this to be the most evident;
and yet frequent admonitions are needed
to renew the impreflion of it upon man-
kind. For what purpose did thy Creator
place thee in this world, in the midst of
human society, but that as a man among
men thou mighteft cultivate humanity;
that each in his place might contribute to
the general welfare; that as a spo~use, a

brother .

heart; and thus af'pire to resemble Him
who ever consults the good of his crea-
tures, and whose tender mercies are over
all hz is works ? And dareft thou, who haft
been sacrificing unfuf~picious innocence to
thy loose pleasures; ,hou who haft been
diflurbing the repose of society by thine
ambition or craft ; thou, who, to increase
thy treasures, haft been making the wi-
dow and the orphan weep; dareft thou
approach God with thy worthip and thy
prayers, and entertain the hope that he
wrill look down upon thee in peace ? Will
the God of order and juffice accept such
poor compens~ation for his violated laws
Will the God of love regard the services
of one w~ho is an enemy ·to his creatures?

I HAVE now flhewn the evil of mnaim-

ing and splitting religion; of dividing
afimder two things, which though in
theory they may be sep~arated, yet in
pradtice must always co-exist if either of
them be real, Devotion to God and Cha,-
rity to men. Let us confider next the
happy effeLas of their union.

Their union formns the consistent, the

graceful, the ref~pedable charader of the
rea'l Christian, the man of true worth.
If you leave either of them out of your
fyfitem_, even though you excel in the:
other, you can fland trial only in one
point of view. It is only on on-e fide
your char~ader is fair i on the oither it;
will always be open to~ much reproach.
And as you dithonour yourselves, so you

V oL. I. C do

SER M. do great injuffice to religion. For, by

-Idividing its parts from· one another, you

never fail to expose it to the centure .0f
the world: And perhaps, by this fort of
partial and divided goodness, religion has
fuffe~red more in the esteem of manlkind,
than by open profligacy. The unbeliever
will focoff at your piety, when he fees you
negligent of moral duties. The bigot will
decry all morality, when he fees you pre-
tending to be a follower of virtue, though
you be aderpifrerof God. Whereas he
who f'ears God, and is at the fam~e time
just and beneficent to men, exhibits reli-
gion to the world with full propriety. It
thines in his condua with its native fplen-
dour; and its rays throw a. glory round
him. His charader is above reproach.
It is at once amiable and venerable. Ma-
-lice itsel!f is afraid to attack him; and
even the worit m~en ref~ped~ and honour
him in their hearts.

This too is the man whose life will be

most peaceful and happy. He who fails
materially either in piety or in virtue, is

always

morse~. His partial goo~dness~ may flatter ~
him in the day of s~uperfic~ial obferv~tioan;
but; wrhen ol~iutude or d~iffreifs awakens th~e
powers of refleaion, he t~hall. b made, to
feel, that one part of du~ty performed,
atones not: for; anothe-r iwhich is nEegleed.
In the midst of his prayers, th~e re~emn-
brance of injnfhee will: u~phrid him, with

his f~atisfaation is destitute of that glow of
affe~ion, which enlivens the feelings of
one who li'fts his heart at the fame time
to the father of the uriiverfe, and confi-
ders hims~elf as imitating God. The man
.again who r·ests solely on devotion, if that
devotion open not his heart to humanity,
not only remains a firanger to the plea-
fures of beneficence, but muff often un-
dergo the pain arising from bad pafirons.
But when beneficence and devotion are
united, they pour upon the man in whom
they meet, the full pleasures of a good
and pure heart. His alms connedted him
with men; his prayers with God. He
looks without dismay on both worlds.
All nature has to' him a b~enign afpefl.

presence.

pretence. Every where he traces the be- 8 ER M.
neficent hand of the Author of nature; c
and every where, with glowing heart,
he hears and anfwvers his s~ecret voice.
Whene he looks up to heaven, he rejoices
in the thought that there dwells that God
whom he serves and honours, that Sa-
viour in whom he trusts; that Spirit of
grace from whose inspiration his piety and
his charity flow. WIhen he looks around
him on the world, he is soothed with the
pleasing remembrance of good offices which
he has done, or at least has fludied to do,
to many who dwell there. How comfort-
able the refleaion, that him no poor man
can upbraid for having withheld his due s
him no unlfortunate man can reproach for
having s~een and defpiled his sorrow~s , but
that on his head are des~cending the pra~yers
of the needy and the aged ; and that th~e
hands of those~ whom his prote~iion has
supported, or his bounty has fed, are lifted
up in frecret to bleis him !

pr~inciple~s of the Christ~ian religion. In
order to re~move= this obiruction Ito his
rising graces, and to bring him to the full
knowl~edge of that God whom he foug9ht
to honour, he was favoured with a ifuper-

natu ral

natural message fro~m heaven. W7hile the SE!RM.
princes of the earth were left to ad tby -
the cour·Ifels of thleir own wis~dom; while,
without -interpolition from above, Gene-
rals conqluered or fell, according to the
vicissitude of human things; to this good
centurion an Angel was commifl~ioned from
the throne o~f God.

What can I faLy more or higher in praise

of this bleifed charadter, than that it is
what God delights to honour ? Men single
out as the objeats of diftination, the great,
the brave, or the r~enzowned. But hke whto
JeethS not as man feetb6, passing by those
qualities which often thine with false iplen-
dour to humnan obs~ervation, looks to the
inward principles of zAion; to those prin-
ciples which form the ess~ence of a wtor-thy
charadter; and which, if called ~forth,
would give birth to whiatever is laudable
or excellent in conduc'.-I-s there one,
though in humble fltation or obs~cure life,
who feareth God andl wcorketh rgrhteoup
nes~s; whose prayers and alms, proceeding
in regular uanaffedted tenour, bespeak the

upright,

SER M* upright, the tender, the devout heart?--

I Thole alms and prayers come up mn me-

morial before that God who is no refpeller
of perfans, The Almighty; beholds him
from his throne with complacency. Di·-
vine illumination is ready to infiruA him.
Angels miniffer to him. They now snark
him out on earth as their future affciate;
and for him they make ready in paradise,
the wherite robes,the palmsJ, and the sceptres of
the .just.

To this honour, to this blessedness, let

our hearts conti nu allyafpire; and thnrough-r
out the whole of life, let those solemn and
sacr-ed words, with which I conclude,
found in our ears, and be the great di,
reaory of our condua : * He hath f eweed
thee, O manh, ·what it good ; and wh~at doth
the Lord thy God require of thee, but-to~ do

TH E life of man has always been a SER M.
very mixed slate, full of uncertainty and ,I-
vicifirtude, of anxieties and fears. In every
religious audience,. there are many who
fall: ader the denomination of the uanfor-
tunate; and the reft are ignorant how

For the prosperity of no man on earth is

paus. ~While the ~wi~d~om of the world is thus
occupied, religion has been no les~s atten-
tive to the faLme importaLnt objeat. It in-
form~s us in the Text, of a pavilion which
God erefts to thelter his servants in th5e
tim~e of troublte, of a fcret place in his taber-
nacle into which he brings them, of a
rock on whe5ich7 he ets them~ u~p ; and else
where he tells us of a f~ield and a b~uckler
which he spreads before them, to cater
themz froml thae terror biy night, and the· ar-
rowe that f~ieth by day. Now of what
nature are thnofe infirumnents of defence,
which God is reprefeated as providing
wt~ith s~uch solicitous care for thos~e who
fear him~ ? as he reared up any bul-
warks, impregnable by misfortune, in
order to s~eparate the pious and virtuous
·from the reft of -mankind, and to s~creen
them from the common dis~asters of life ?
~No: To those d~ilfafers we behold them
liable no less~ than others. T~he defence
which religion provides, is altogether of

an

SER M. an internal kind. It is the heart, not the

' outward slate, which it profeffes to guard.

W~hen the timre of trourble comes, as come
it muff to all, it places good men under
the pavilion of the Almighty, by afford-
ing them that s~ecurity and peace which
arise from the belief of divine proteaion.
It brings them into the secret of his taber-
nacle, by opening to them sources of con-
folation wYhich are hidden from others.
By that firength of mind with which it
endows them, it sets them uip upon a rock,
a gainft which the tempest may~ violently
beat, but which it cannot thake.

How far the comforts proceeding from

religion merit those high titles under
w~hich they are here figuratively deferib-
ed, I thall in this diifcourf~e endeavour t~o
thow~. I thlall for this end compare toge-
ther the situation of bad men and that of
the good, when both are fufferingS the
misfortunes of life 3 and then make such
improvement as the f~ubjea will naturally

It. RPELIGION

I. RELIGION prepares the mind for en- 8 E M.

countering, with fortitude, the moss s~evere Lj
thocks of adversity ; whereas vice, by its
natural influence on the temper, tends to
produce dejedion under the slightest trials.
W~hile worldly men enlarge their posses~-
fions, and extend their coned~ians, they
imagine tha t they are firengthening them-
selves against all the pofirble vicissitudes of
·life. They fay in their he-arts, JMy mousn-
tain sands frong, and I/hall never be mnou-
ed. But so fatal is their delusion, that, in-
fleadi of firengtheniing, they are weaken-
ing' that which only can s~upport: them
when thos~e vicissitudes come. It is the~ir
mind which mtift then s~upport them;
and their mind, by their sensual attach-
ments, is corrupted and enfeebled. 'Ad-
diAed with intemperate fondnes~s to the
pleasures of the world, they incur two
great and certain evils; they both ex-
clude themselves from every resource ex-
cept the world, and they increas~e their
sensibility to every blow which comes up-
on them from that: quarter.

They

sER M. They have neither principles nor tem-

II.~ pr which can fland the assault of trouble.

They have no principles wrhich lead themn
to look beyiond the ordinary rotation of
events; and therefore, wrhen misfortunes
involve them, the profpett must be com-
fortlefs on every fide. Thleir crimes have
disqualified them from looking up to the
afiffRance of any higher power than their
own ability, or for relying on any better
guide than their own wvifdom. And as
from principle they ·can derive no sup-
port, so in a temper corrupted by pro-
Cperity they find not relief. They have
loft that moderation of mInd which en-
ables a wvife man to accommodate hims~elf
to his situation. Long fed with false
hopes, they are exasperated and ffung~ by
ev-ery disappointment. L~uxuri~ous and
effemina~te, they can boear no unealinefs.
Proud and pres~ump~tuous, they can brook
no opposition. By nourishing dipoitionsi~
w~hich so little fiuit this u~ncertain flatec,
·thle have infus~ed a double portion of bit-
terners into the cup of woe a they have

irharpened

tharpened the edge of that ilword which is SE IM-
lift'ed upto sm~ite them Strange~rsto all cc~
the temperate fatisfadious of a good and
apure mind; firangers to every pleasure
except what was s~easoned by vice or vani ty,
their adversity is to the last degree dilcon-
solate. Health and opulence were the two
pillars on which they rested. Shake either
of them; and their whole edifice of hope
and comfort falls. Pr-offrate and f~orloru,
they are left on the ground; obliged to
join with the man of Ephraim in his -ab-
jea lament'ation,, 'I'by haCIve taen lawzy
myi~ gords, whe~ich IT have maade, and whati
haue I mlore*?--Such are the causes to
which we must afecribe the broken s~pirits,
the peeviih temper, and i mpatient passions,
that so often attend the declining age, or
falling fortunes of vicious men.

But how di-f-fe-~frent is the condition of a

truly good man in those trying fituattions
of life ! Religion had gradually prepared
his mind for all the events of this incon-
slant Aat~e. It had infirud2ed him in the

nature

*5 Judges xv~ii. 24.·

SESR M. nature of true happinefTs. It had early·

L weaned him from the undue love of the

world, by dis~covering to him its vanity,
and by setting higher profpeats in his
view. Affiftions do not attack him by
s~urpr~ise, and therefore do not overwhelm
him. He was equipped for the florm, as
well as the calm, in this dubious naviga-
tion of life. Under those conditions he
knew himself to be brought hither, that
he was not to retain always the enjoy-
ment of whrat he loved: And therefore he
is not overcome by dii'appointment, whena
that: which is mortal, dies;· when ·that:
which is mutable, begins to~change; and
when that which he knew to be transient,
passes a~~way.,

All the principles which religion teaches,

and all the habits which it forms,· are faL-
vourable to firength of mind. It will be
found, that whatever purifies, fortifies
also the heart. In the course of living
rrigh~~teouy, Joberly, and godly, a good man
acquires a fleady and wyell-governed fpi-
r~it. Trained, by Divine grace, to enjoy

with

with moderation the advantages of the SE~M.
world, neither lifted up by s~uccess, notT~-~
enervated with sensuality, he meets the
changes in his lot without unmanly de-
jedion. He is inured to temperance and
refiraint. He has learned firmnes~s and
felf-command. H~e is accuffomed to
lookr up to that Supreme Providence,
which disposes of human affairs, not
w~ithi reverence only, but with trust and
hope.

The time of prorperityi was to him not

merely a se~ason of barren joy, but pro-
du~tive of much dieful improvement.
He had cultivated his mind. He had
flored it w~ith useful knowledge, with
good principles, and virtuous difpoli-
tions. Therfe resources remain entire
w-hen the days of trouble come. They
remain wlith him in sickness, as in
health j in poverty, as in the midst of
riches; in, his darkr and solitary hours,
no less than when surrounded with
friends and gay society. From the glare
of prosper~ity, he can, without dejedion,

VoL. I. D w~ithdraw

SER M. wtithdraw~ into the thade. Excluded flrom

tl~J several advantages of the world, he may

be obliged to retreat into 'a narrower
circle; but within that circle he will find
many comforts left. His chief pleasures
were alwrays of the calm, innocent, and
temperate kind; and over there, the
changes of the world have the least power.
His mind is a kingdom to him i and he
can flill enjoy it. The world did not
beffow; upon him all his enjoyments; and
therefore it_ is not ·in the power of the
world, by its most cruel attacks, to carry-
them all away.

II. THrE diffreffes of life are alleviate~d

to good men, by refleations on their past
condue~ i wihile, by such refleaions, they
are highly aggravated to the bad. Du-ring
the gay and adtive periods of life, sinners
clude, in fomie measure, the force of con-
science. Carried round in the whirl of
affairs and pleas~ures; intent on contriv-
anc~e, or e~ager in pursuit; amus~ed by ~hope,
or1 elated by enjoyment a they are theltered

by

by that crowd of trifles which surrounds SE R
them from se~riou~s thought. But con- ~
Ocience is too great a power- to fremain
always s~uppressed., There -is In every
ma~n's life, a period when he (hall be
made to fland forth as a real obje £1 to
h~is own vricw : And when that period
comes, Wer to him who is galled by the
fight i In the dark and so~litary hour of
difirers, with a mind hurt and fore from
fiome recent wound of fortune, how thlall
he bea-r to have his charaater for the first
time dlifelofed to him, in that humiliating
light under which guilt will necessarily
present it ? Then the recollgetion of the
paflt becomes dreadful. It exhibits to himn
a life thrown away on vanities and follies,
or cons~umed in flagitioufnef-s and fin; no
fltation properly supported; no material
duties fulfilled. Crimes which once ;had
been easily palliated, rife before him iri
their native deformity. The s~ense~ of guilt
mixes itfel~ef with all that has befatllen him.
He beholds, or thinks that he beholds,
t-he hand of the God whonm he hath of-

D 2 fended,

S EUR M. fended, openly stretched out against him.

~LI -At a s~eason when a man flands most in

ne~ed of support, how intolerable is the
weight of this additional load, aggravat-
ing the deprefiron of disease, difagppoint-
ment, or old age ! How miserable his
slate, who is condemned to endure at once
the pangs of guilt, and the vexations of
calamity ! Z'The /pirit of a man may fu/ain
his inlfrmiies; d ut ar wuounde~d spirit, whro
can Bear ?2

'Whereas, he w~ho is' blesSed with a clear

confeience, enjoys, in the worst conjunc-
tures of human life, a peace, a dignity,
an elevation of mind, peculiar to virtue.
The testimony of a good cons~cience is·
indeed to be always distinguished from
that pres~umptuous boast of innocence,
whic~h every good Christian totally dif-
claims. The better he is, he will be the
more hu mble, and sensible of his failings.
But though he ack~nowvledge that he can
claim nothing from God upon the foot-
ing of desert, yet he can trust in his mer-
ciful acceptance through Jesus Christ ac-

cordin~g

cording to the terms of the ,gospel. He SE My.
can hope, that his prayers and his alms c
have comae ucp in memorial before God. T he
piety and virtue of his former life were
as feeds sown in his pros~perous slate, ~of
which he reaps the fruits in the season of
adversity. The riches, the pleasures, and
the friends of the world, may have made
wein~gs to thbemfelves, and flo·wn awe~ay. Bu t
the improvement which he made of those
advantages while they lasted, the tempe-
rate spirit: with which he enjoyed them,
the beneficent adtions which he perfocrm-
ed, an~d the good example which he set to
others, remain behind.- By the memory
of thes~e, he enjoys his prosperity a fe-
cond time in refle~tion; and perhaps this
second and refled~ed enjoyment is not in-
ferior to the firit. It arrives at a more
critical and needfulf time. It: afFords him
the high fiatisfadion of htaving extra~ted
lasting pleafuzre from that which is thort;
and of having fixed that which by it~s
nature was changing.-"' If my race be
"C nowv about to end, I have this com-

"C for t,

"C turity has no terrors. I have ende--
L( voured to do my· duty, and to make
~'my peace with God. I leave the reft
CCto Hreavern." These are thre reflea~i'ons
which to theJ ulpright matke ·igh~t arsfje~ in
darknesS; refle~ionis which sheer· the
lonely house of virtuous poverty, and at-
tend the confcientiouRT'ufferer into prison
or exile; which sooth the complaints of
grief, lighten the preirure of old age, and
fu~rnish to the bed of sicknes~s, a cordia~l
of more grateful relish, and more fove-
reign virtue, than anly which the worl'd can
affo~rd.

Loo'k abroad into- life, a-nd you wiHi

Eind the general sense of mankind bearing
wYitnefs to this important truth, thait miind
is su~perior to fortune; thrat what one
feels within, is of muchl greater importance
than all that befalls him without. Let a
man be brought into fame such severe
and trying situation, as fly~es the attention

of the public on his behaviour. The SE M-jl
first question which wle put concerning · . -
him, is not, What does he fuffer ? but,
How does he bear it? Has he a qluiet
mind? or, Does he appear to be un-
happy- within? · If we judge him to be
cornpof~ed and firm, resigned to Provi-
dence, and supported by cons~cious inte-
grity, his charaater rises, and his misery
lessens in our view. We esteem and ad-
m~ire, rather than pity him. RecolleRt
what holy men have endured for the fake
of conscience, and with what cheerfulness
they have fliff~ered. On the other hand,
when cons~cience· has concurred, with .out-
ward misforthnes in diffrefirng the guilty,
think of the dreadful consequences which
have ensued. How often, upon a reverse
of fortune, after abused prosperity, have
they madly hurri~ed thems~elves over that:
precipice from which there is no ret-urn;
and, in what nature most abhors, the vo-
luntary extindion ~of life, have fought re-
lief from that torment of refle~tion, which
was become too great for them to bear?

.Never

8 E M. Never then allow yours~elves to imagine,

~J .that misfortunes alonle form the chief

miiery of man. None but the guilty are
completely miserable. The misgiving and
diffruff, the accusations and reproaches of
their minds, the sense of having drawn
down upon their heads the evils which
they fuffer, and the terrifying expedtation
of more and wYorf~e evils to come; there
are the essential ingredients of human
mis~ery. They not only whet the edge,
but they envenom the darts of affliAion,
and add poison to the wound. W~hereas
when misfortunes assail a good man, they
carry no such fatal auxiliaries in their
train. They may ruffe the surface of
his foul a but there is a firength· within,
which resists their farther imprefflon. The
conflitution of his mind is found. -The
world can inflid upon it no wounds, but
what admnit of cure.

III. I~L Lmen, in the time of trouble,

can look up to no pr~otedor; while good
men comm~it themselves, with trust and

h ope,

hope, to the care of Heaven. The hu- 8 E M.
man mind, naturally feeble, is made to -
feel all its weaknes~s by the press~ure of
adversity. DejeLaed with evils which
overpower its firength, it relies no longer
on itself. It casts every where around, a
withing, exploring eye, for some shelter to
s~creen, some power to uphold it; and if,
when abandoned by the world, it can
find nothing to· which it may fly in the
room of the world, its slate is truly far-
lorn. Now, whither thould the ungodly,
in this situation, turn for aid ? After hat-
ing contended with the florms of adverse
fortune till their spirits are exhauffed,
gladly would they retreat at lass to the
f~anauary of religion. But: that fanEtuary
is ihut against them; nay, it is environed
with terrors. T~hey behold there, not a
Protedor to whom they; can fly, but a
Judge whom they dread·; and in those~
moments when th~ey need his friendship
the most, they are reduced to deprecate
his wrath. If he once called whaen they
refapd, and vfreched ouct his hannds whren

they'

8 ER 19. t'hey woute~~ not regard, how much resafon

I have they to fear that he will leave them

now to eat th~e frucit of rcthir owen was
and to be silted writhc their owzn devoices ;
that he ·wil lcaurgh at their calamity, and
mock wheren theirfear cometh.

But of all the thoughts which can enter

into the mind, in the season of diffrefs,
the belief of an interest in his favour
who rules the world is the nioft soothing.
Every form of religion has afforded to
virtuouis rnen some degree of this confola-
tion. But it wP~as reserved8 for the Chri-
fliani revelation, to carry it ts its highe~st
point. For it is the dire~l scope of that
revelation to accommoda~te itself to thIe
circumstances of man, unde~r twoi main
viewcs; as guilty in the fight of: God,
and as firuggling with the evils of .thle
wtorld. Under the formner, it: difcoverts
to him a Mi~ediaitor and an at~onement;
under the la~tter, it promises him the
Spirit of grace and? cons~olation. It is a
fyfitem of complete relief, extending from
our spiritual to our temporal diffreffes..

The

"fhe fame hand which holds out forgive. 8 ER~ IV
ness to the penitent, and affifance to the .L-
frail, dispen~ses comfort and hope to the
a~ssisted.

It deserves your particular notice, in

this view, that there is no chara~ter
which God more; frequently assumes to
himself in the fagcred writings, than that
of the Patron of the diffreffed. Compaf~i-
sion is that attaribute of his n~ature which
he has chiofen to place in the greatest~ va-
riety of lights, on purpose that he might
accommodate hi~s inajefly to our weak-
nelrs, and provide a cordial for human
griefs. H~e is the hearer of all prayers;
but with· particular attention he is repre-
fentedf as listening to the cry of the~ POOr,
and regarding the prrayer of the def2itute.
All his creatures he governs ~i~th juffice
and wif~domn; but he takecs to himself, in
a special manner, the charge of (fLexcutin~gr
juldgment for the opprefed~, of protepling· the
f~ranlger, of deiveri~cinzg· him ?bo hath no
helper from7 the hands of the Jfoiler. For the

opreln of the poor, and fjb th~e fighingC~ Of

SE M. the needy, will Iarfe faith the Lord, to

f
, et himn in safety from hbim that pufeth at

hima. He is the father of the fatherle/s, and
thde 'fudge of the creidowre, in his holy abi-~~
tation. He raifeth up them that care bowreed
dowon. He dwiellrth wzeith the contcrite. He
healeth th5e brken tin heart. Fobr he knowe-
eth our ~frame; a e reme~mberethd that wroe
rare duf *.--If the wisdom of his provi~-
dence saw it treceffary to place so many
of his cr~eatures in an affiifted slate, that
slate, however, he commi~serates. He
difdatins not to point out himself as the
refuge of the virtuous.and pious; and to
invite them, .amidst all their troubles, to
pour out their hearts before him. ThofCe
circumfitances which estrange others-from
them, interest him the more in their fitti-
ation. The negle61 or scorn of the world
expores them not to any contempt in his
i'gh)t. No obscurity conceals them fr-om
his notice; and though they thould be
forgotten~ by every friend on earth, they

atre

* Pfal. ix. 8.--cil. I/.--cxlvi. li.-1xrviii. J.-ecxlvii. 3*

are remembered by the God of heaven. SE M-
That sigh, heaved from the affidted bo- cc
fom, which is heard by no human ear, is
liffened to by him; and that tear is re-
marked, which falls unnoticed or despised
by the world.

Such views of the Supreme Being, im-

part the most sensible consolation to every
pious heart. They pres~ent his admini-
firation under an afped to mild and be-
nign, as in a great measure to disperse
the gloom which hangs over human life.
.A good man aa~s with a vigour, and sus-
f~ers with a patience more than hu~man,
when he believes himrfelf countenanced
by the Almighty. Injured or oppressed
b~y the world, he looks up to a Judge
who will vindicate his cause; he appeals
to a witness who knows his integrity a
he comnmits hims~elf to a Friend who will
never ·forfiake him. Wihen tired with the
vexations of life, dlevotion opens to him
its quiet retreat, where the tumults of the
world are huthed, and its cares are loss in
happy oblivion ; where the ?eicked cease

.fromn

SER M. fromn tr~oubling, atnd thie weary are at refl.

IL_)There his mind regains his for~enity; the

agitation of pafiron is calmed; and a fef-
tening balm is infused into the wou-nds.
of the piLrit. Dife~lofing to an invisible
Friend those~ secret griefs which he has
no encouragement to make known to the
world, his heart is lightened. He does
not feel himself solitary or forsake~n. He
believes God to be prelent with him, and
the Holy Ghoff to be the inspirer of .his
consolations. From that secret place of'
thbe divine tabernacle, into which the Text
represents him as admitted, he hears this
voice issue, Call u~pon me in th~e day of'
troublel, and I will an/wer thee. Fcear not;
~for Iam w~eith thee. Be not d~inayed; for
I am thy God. And as he hears a voice
which speaks to none but the pure in
heart, so he beholds a hand which sinners
cannot fee. He beholds the hand of
Providence conduc~ing all the hidden
springs and movements of the universe;
and with a secret, but unerring operation,
dlireding every event towards the happi-

ness

nes~s of the righteous. Those affliftions SE R. M.
which appear to others the messengers of c -
the wrath of Heaven, appear to him the
miniffers of fan~tification and wisdom.
Wrhere they dis~cern nothing but the hor-
rors of the tempest whiich s~urrounds
them, his more enlightened ey~e beholds
the' Angel who rides in the whirlwind,
and direc~ts the storm. Hence a peace
keeping the mind and heart, which is no
where to be found but under the pavlion
of the A9lmighty.

]IV. Goon men are comforted under

their troubles by the hope of Heaven;
while bad men are not only deprived of
this hope, but diffreffed with fears arising
from a future state. The foul of man
can never divefti itself wholly of anxiety
about its fate hereafter. There are hours
when even to the pros~perous, in the midst
of their pleasures, eternity is an awful
thought. But much more when those
pleasures, one after another, begin to

awa~Jy Jaffly is this hope ftiled in scrip- ~~

flledfyt. For what an anchor is to a ship
in a darkr night, on an unknow~n coait,
and amidst a boifferous- ocean, that is
this hope to the foul when diffradted by
the confusions of the world. In danger,
it gives s~ecurity; amidit general fluAua-
tion, it affords one fixed point of reft. It:
is indeed the most eminnent of all the
advantages which religion now confers.
For, confider the mighty power of hope
over ·the human mind. It: is the univer-
Pal comforter. It is the spring of all hu-
man ad-ivity. Upon futurity, men are
conflantly s~uspended. Animated by the
profpedt of some d~ifant good, they toil
and fuffer throulgh the whole course~ of
life; aind it is not. so much w;Ehat they are
at pres~ent, asi what they hope to be in
f'ome after time, that enlivens their mo-
tions, fixes atttention, and flimulates in-
duffry. Now, if in the common aFfairs
of life sauch is the energy of hope, even

n~ot merelyl alleviate, but totall-y annihilate
all huma~n m~is-eries. It wo~uld. ban~ish dit-

from the hope of a better- world; where
thos~e comforts thall be again reffored; and
all the virtuous thall be ass~embled, in the
presence of h~im who made them. Such
hopes banish that despair which ovrer-
whelms, and leave only that tender melan-
choly which softens the heart, and often
renders the whole charadfer more gentle
and amlable.

O v this nature are the reso~urces w7hichn

religion provides for good men. By its
previous dis~cipline, it trains them to for-
titude s by the refle~ions of a good con-
s~cience it f~ooths, by the s~ens~e of Divine
favour it su~pports them; and when every
comfort fails them on earthi, it cheers
them with the hope of heaven. Diftin-
guif hing his ser vants with such advantages,
God is justly sa~id to erea his pauiliona over
them in the evil time. He not only/prerads
at tent, for them in thp e wildmernfs, but he
transforms in fame measure the slate of

~I~j~religion recommends, as both more ho-

God. Let him who would aA upon this
plan, adopt for the rule of his condua,
that maxim of the Pfalmrift's, TiruJ tin the
Lord, and do good *. To firm integrity,
let him join an humble reliance on God.
Let his adherence to duty, encourage his
religious trust. Let his religious trufft,
inspire him with fortitude in the perfor-
mance of his duty. Let him know no
path but the firaight and direat one. In

Such principles -as these, are the best
prepar·ation for the vicissitudes. of the
human lot. They are the thield of in-

thus, shall be expose~d to no wounds
but what religion can cure. He may

tribute in a high degree to enliven pro-

The sense of being diftinguilhed by the
kindness of another, gladdens the heart,
warms it with reciprocal affe~ion, and
gives to any poffefiron which is agreeable
in its~elf, a double relish, from its being
the gift of a friend. Favours conferred
by men, I acknowledge, may prove bur-
denfome. For human virtue is never per-
sea; and sometimes unre~asonable expedta-
tions on the one fide, fomnetimes a morti-
fy~ing sense. of dependence on the other,

this kind can affed the intercours~e of gra-

dirinterefied; and with a gratitude the
most cordial and unfufipicious, a, good man
looks up to that Almighty Benefaator, who
aims at no end but the happines~s of those
whom he blesses, and who desires no re-
turn from them but a devout and thankful
heart. While others can trace their pro-
fperity to no higher source than a concur-
rence of worldly caus~es, and often, of
mean or trifling incidents, which occafi-
onally favoured their designs; with what
superior f~atisfadiion does the servant of
God remark the hland of that gracious
Power which hath raised him up; w~hich

On our Imperfed Ke owmanon of a

FUT TJ E S~r A*r .

r C R. Xiii. x 2.

For nr~~er seefee through a glass darkly~.

THE Apofile here deferibes the im- SER M.
perfe~ion of our knowledge with rela- . "*
tion to s~piritual and eternal objea~s. He
employs two metaphors, to represent more
firongly the dis~advantages under which
we lie: One, that we fee those ob-
jeAs through a glasS, -thatt is, i throrugh the
intervention of a medctium wvhich obfecures
their glo~ry ; the other, that we f~ee them
rin a riddle or enigma, which our tranfla-
tors have rendered by feeing, them daLrkly a
that is, the truth in part discovered, in

part:

sE RM* part concealed, and placed beyond our

~I ·comprehension.

This defecription, howvever juff and true,

cannot fail to occasion some perplexity·
to an enquiring mind. For it may f~eern
firange that so much darkness thould be
left upon those celestial objeas, towards
which we are at the fame time commanded
to aspire. We are firangers to the uni-
vers~e of Gock Confined to that s~pot on
which we dwell. W7e are permitted to
know nothing of what is tran~a~ting in
the regions above us and around us. By
much labour, we acquire a fiuperficial
acqualintance with a few s~ensible objeas
which we find in our pres~ent habitation ;
but wye enter, and we depart, under a to-
tal ignorance of the nature and laws of
the ifpiritual wiorld. One f~ubjefl in par-
.ticulanr, when our thoughts proceed in this
train, m~ust often recur upon the mind
with1 peculiar anxiety a that is, the im-
m~ortalirjy of the foul, and the future slate
of m~an. Expos~ed as we are at pref~ient to
f~lchl variety of affliaions, and fabjeated

to so much disappointment in all our pur- SE M-
fauits of happineis,. Why, it may be said, ---
has our gracious Creator denied us the
consolation of a full discovery of our fu-
ture exiffence, if indeed s~uch an existence
be prepared for us ?--Reason, it is true,
s~uggests many arguments in behalf of
immortality : Revelation gives full affu-
rance of it. Yet even that gospel which
is said to have broukght life anid imnmortality
to ighbt, allows us to fee onl~y through a
gulafS darkly. It doth not yet azppear w~at
we~elhall be. Our knowledge of a future
world, is very imperfea ; our ideas of it,
are faint and conifufed. It is not displayed
in such a manner, as to make an impref-
sion s~uited to the importance of the objedt.
The faith even of the best men, is much
inferior both in clearness and in force,·
ts the evidence of se~nse; and proves, on
many occasions, inf~ufficient to counterba-
lance the temptationsof the pref~eut world.
Happy moments indeed there sometimes
are in the lives of' pious ,men, when fCe-
qjueffered from worldly cares, and borne up

8 E R M. on the wings of divine contemplation,they

c-I- ·rife to a nearer and transporting view of

immortal glory;. But such efforts of the
mind are rare, and cannot be long sup-
ported. When the spirit of meditation
subsides, this lively Tenf'e of a future slate
decays, and though the general belief of
it remain, yet even good men, when they
return to the ordinary busines~s and cares of
life seem to rejoin the multitude, and to
re-affume the fame hopes, and fears, and
interests, wNhich infuencce the reft of the

world .

From suc~h refleCaions, a considerable

difficulty refpeding this important s~ub-
jeat, either aris~es, or seems to arise. WCas
s~uch an obscure and imperfe8t discovery of
another life worthy to proceed from G5od?
Does it not: afford some ground, either to
tax his goodness, or to f~uiped the evi-
dence of its comning from him ?-This is
the point which we are now to confider ;
and let us confider it with that clofre atten-
tion which the f~ubjeat merits. Let us en-
quire, whether we have any reason, ei-

ther

ther to complain of Providence, or to ob- $ ER M.n
jea to the evidence of a future Rtate, be-
cause that evidence is not of a more fen-
fible and firiking nature. ~e't us attempt
humbly to trace the reasons, why, though
permitted to know and to fee somewhat of
the eternal world, we are nevertheleifs per-
mitted only to knowe lin part, and to Joe
thr~ough a gla/s darkl-y.

IT plainly appears to be the plan of
the D~eity, is all his difpenfagtions, to mix
light with darknes~s, evidence with uncert-
tainty. Whatever the reasons of this pro-
cedure be, the faa~ is undeniable. He is
~defecribed in the O'ld Testament, as a God
that blideth himf/relf * Cloutds and darkneft
are said to surround him. His rotay isin the
sea, and hispath in the great troaters , his
~fdooeps are no~t known~t. Both the works
and the ways of God are full of mystery.
In the ordinary course of his government,
innumerable events occur which perplex
us to the uatmoft. There is a certain lImit

SER M. to all our enquiries in religion, beyond

' which if we attempt to proceed, we are

loft in a maze of inextricable difficulties.
Even that revelation which affords such
material infirudion to man, concernmng
his duty and his happiners, leaves many
doubts unresolved. Why it was not given
s~ooner; why not to all men; why there
thould be to many things in it hard to be un-
derf~ood, are difficulties not inconsiderable,
in the midst of that incontestable evidence
by which it is supported. If, then, the
future slate of man be not placed in to full
and clear a light as we desire, this is no
more than what the analogy of all reli-
gion, both natural.and revealed, gave us
reason to expedt.

But fixch a s~olution of the difficulty will

be thought impedfea. It may, perhaps,
not give much fagtisfadion, to ihow that
all religion abounds with difficulties of a
like nature. Our situation, it will be fagid,
is to much the more to be lamented, that
not on orne fide only we are confined in our
enlu iries, bu t on all hands environed with

myfie~rious

mysterious obfcurity.--Let us then, if to S E ~M
much diffatisfied with our condition, give Cy
scope for once to Fancy, and confider how
the plan of Providence might be redified
to our with. Let us call upon the Scep-
tic, and desire him tofay, what measure
of information would afford him entire
fagtisfadtion.

This, he will tell us, requires not any

long or deep deliberation. He desires only
to have his view enlarged beyond the li-
mits of this corporeal slate. Inficad of
reffing upoix evidence which requires dif-
cuflion, which muff be fu pported by mu ch
reas~oning, and which, after all, he alleges
yields very imperfed information, he de-
mands the everlasting manlions to be to
difiplayed, if in truth fo~ch maniious there
be, as to place faith on a level with the
evidence of sense. W~hat noble and happy
effeats, he exclaims, would instantly fol-
low, if man thus beheld his present and
his future exiffence at once before him !
H~e would then become worthy of his rankr
in the creation. IniteadE of being the sport,

E ER M. as now, of degrading pafflons and childfll

,,attachments, he would aQ solely on thl

principles of immortality. His pursuit o
virtue would be Rteady ; his life would lix
undisturbed and happy. Superior to the,
attacks -of diiarers, and to the folicitations
of pl~easure, he would advance by a regu-
lar process, towards those divine rewards
and honours which were continually pre-
sent to his view.--Thus Fancy, with
as much eas~e and~ confidence as if it were
a perfedt judge of creation, ereas a new
world to its~elf, and exults with admira-
tion of its o~wn work. But let us pause,
and suspend this- admiration, till we
coolly examine the consequences that
would follow from this supposed reforma-
tion of the universe.

CO N SI D ER the nature and circumstances
of man. Introduced into the world in·
an indigent condition, he is supported at
firR by the care of others; and,. as soon
as· he begins to aat for himself finds la-
bou r a nd induff ry to be necessary for sus-

taining

jtaining his life, and Aupplying his wants. E :M.
Mhutual defence and interest give rife to c
fabciety , and society when formed, re-
iquires diftindions of property, diversity
of conditions,' subordination of ranks,
and a multiplicity of occupations, in or-
der to advance the general good. The
fEervices of the: poor, and the proteaion
of the rich, become reciprocally necessary.
The governors, and the govierned, must
co-operate for general ~safety. Variosus
arts muff be fludied; so-me refrpeding the
cultivation of the mind, others, the care
of the body; f~orte to ward off the evils,
and some to provide the conveniencies of
life. In a word, by the deflination of
his Creator, and the necefirties of his
nature, man c~ommences, at once, an
adive, not merely a contemplative being.
Religion assumes him as such. It s~up-
poses him employed in this world, as on
a buyT fla~ge. It regulates, but does not
abolish, the enterprizes and cares of or-
dinary life. It addresses itself to the va-
rious ranks in faciety, to the rich and

the;

SE RM. the poor, to the magiffrate ahd the s~ub-

I jest. It rebukes the slothful; direats the

diligent how to labour; and requires
every man to do his owen buJine/S.

Suppoile, now, that veil to be ~ivith-

drawrn which conceals an~other world from
our view. Let all obscurity vanish; let
us no longer fee darkly as throug5 a glass;
but let every man enjoy that intuitive
perception of divine and eternal objeats,
which the Sceptic was furppofed to desire.
The immediate effteft of s~uch a dis~covery
would be, to annihilate in our eye all
humanobje £ts, and to produce a total flag-
nation in the affairs of the world. Wrere
the celeffial glory exposed to our ad-
miring view ; did the angelic harmo-
ny found in our enraptured ears ; what
earthly concerns could have the power of
engaging our attention for a single mo-
ment ? All the fludies and purs~uits, the
arts and labours which now employ the
saLivity of man, which support the or-
der, or promote the happiners of s~ociety,
w~ould lie negleetedand abandoned. Those

desires

desires and fears, those hopes and interests SE VRM.
by which we are at present flimulated, c-
would cease to operate. Human life
wsould prefeat no obje~ts f~ufficient to
rout~e the mind; to kindle the fpiritt of
enterprize, or to urge the - hand of in-
duffry. If the mere enfeI ·of duty en-
gaged a good man to take some part in
the business of the world, the task when
submitted to, would prove diftafteful.
Even the preservation of life would be
slighted, if he were not bound to it by
the authority of God. Impatient of his
confinement within this tabernacle of
duff, languishing for the happy day of
his translation to thos~e glorious regions
which were displayed to his fight, he
would sojourn on earth as a melancholy
exile. Whatever Providence has prepared
for the entertainment of man, wvouldl be
viewed with contempt. Whatever is now
attraftive in focietyT, would appear idfipid.
In a word, he would be no longer a fit
inhabitant of this world, nor be qualified
for thos~e exertions which are allotted to

%EI1M' him in his prefeat sphere of being. But,
~L~-~rall his faculties being sublimated above

the meas~ure of humanity, he would be
in the condition of a being of fiuperior
order, who, obliged to reside among men,
would regSard their pursuits wvith s~corn,
as dreams, trifles, and puerile amdufemnents
of a day.

But to this reafoninlg it mayt perhaps

be replied, That foch confequentces as I
have now slated, fiupipofing them to fol.
low, d~eserve not muchr~e~gardi.-For wihat
though the present arrangement of human
affairs were entirely changed, by a clearer
view, and a fironger impression of our fu-
ture slate? Would not s~uch a change prove
the highest bleiling to man ? Is not his
attachment ·to worldly objeits the great
s~ource both o~f his misery and his guilt ?
Employed in perpetual contemplation of
heavenly obje~ts, and in preparation for
the enjoyment of them,- would he not be-
come-t more virtuous, and of courfre more
hlappy, than t~he nature of his pres~ent e~m-
ployments and attachments permits him

to be? ?--A.llowing ~for a moment, the S .~~M
cons~equence to be thich, this much is \-~
yielded, that upon the supposition which
was made, man would not be the crea-
ture which he now is, nor human life· tl e
ta-te which we now behold. How far the
change would contribute to his welfare,
cornes to be considered.

If there be any principle fully afcer-

tained by religion, it is, That this life was
intended for a slate of trial and improve-
ment to man. His preparation for a bet-
ter world required~a gradual purification,
carried on by iteps of progrefirve dif~ci-
plin~e.. The situation, ther~efore, here as-
signed him, was furch as to anfwier this
design, by callin~g forth all his adive
powers, by giving full f~icope to his moral
difpolitions, and bringing to light his
whole charader. Hlence it became pro-
per, that difficulty a-nd temptation thould
aris~e in the course of his duty. Ample re-
wards were promised to virtue; but there
rewards were left, as yet, in obs~curity
and difiant profpedt. The improficuos of

V o L. I. H s~ense

8 E.R M. enfe1 were to balanced againf t the disco-

\ · veries of immortality, as to allow a con-

1liat betwreen faith and f~en~e, between con-
fciience and· desire, between present plea-
sure and future good. In this conflia,
the fouls of good men are tried, improv-
ed, and firengthened. In this field, their
honours are reaped. Here are formed the
capital virtues of fortitude, temnpe~rance,
and felf-denial; moderation in prosperity,
patience in adversity, fubmbiiTon to the
will of God, and charity and forgiveness
to men, amidst the various competitions
of worldly interest.

Such is the plan of Divine wisdom for

man's improvement. But put the cafe,
that the plan devised by human wisdom
were to take place, and that the rewards
of the juff were to be more fully displayed
to view s the exercise of all those: graces
which I haive mentioned, would be entire-
ly iliperfeded. Their very names would
be unknown. Every temptation being
wtithdraw~n, every worldly attachment
being s~ubdued by the overpowering dif-

coveries

coveries of eternity, no trial of sincerity, SEIRM
no difecriminatio~n of charadters, would re- L
main; no opportunity would be afforded
for those aative exertions, which are the
i-neans of purifying and perfefting the
good. On the competition betw~teen time
and eternity, depends the chief exercifre
of human virtue. The obs~curity which
at present hangs over eternal objeats, pre-
s~erves the competition. Remove that ob-
A-uritt, and you removehumanvirtuefrom
its place. You overthrow that whole jfyf
tem of dificipline, by wht~ich imperfelt crea-
tures are, in this life, gradually trained
up for a more perfedt slate,

This, then, is the c-oncluffon to wvhich

at lafl we arrive, That: the full dis~play
which was demanded, of the heavenly
glory, wouild be to far from improvting;
the human foul, that it: would abolith
those virtues and duties which are the
great infiruments of its improvement. It
w~ould be unfauitable to the charad~er of
man in every view, leither as an a~tive
being, or a moral agent. It would dif~-

3H 2 qualify

SiM. qualify him for taking part in the affairs
~rJ of the world; for relithing the pleasures

or for difdharging the duties of life: In
a word, it would entirely defeat the pur-
pos~e of his being placed on this earth.
And the question, Why the Almighty has
been pleared to leave a spiritual world,
and the future existence of man, under so
mruch obscurity, resolves in the end into
this,· Why there thould be s~uch a crea-
ture= as. man in the universe of God i--
Such is the jifue of the improvements
propof'ed to be made on the plans of Pro-
vidence. They add to the dis~coveries of
the superior wisdom of God, and of the
pref~umption' and folly of man.

FIIom what has been said, it nowr ap-

pears, That no reasonable objettion to the
belief of a futur-e. slate aris~es from the
imperfeit diicoveries of it which we en-
joy; from the difficulties that are mingled
with its evidence a from our feeiiag as
thro~ugh a glass darkly, and ·being left to
w~alr by faith and not by fight. It cannot

be other wife, it ought not to be other- SE R"-·
wif~e, in our present slate. The evidence c -
which is afforded, is fu~fficient for the
convidion of a candid mind, fuffcient
for a rational ground of conduet; though
not to firiking as to withdraw our atten-
tion from the present world, or altoge-
ther to overcome the imprefflon of fe~nfi-
ble objeas. In such evidence it becomes
us to acquier~ce, without indulging either
doubts or complaints, on account of our
not receiving all the fatisfadion which
we fondly desire, but which our pres~ent
immaturity of being excludes. For upon
the supposition of immortality, this life is
no other than the childhood of existence;
and the measures of our knowledge mut-n
be proportioned to such a slate. To th~e
f~uccei~fve flages of human lIfe, from in-
fancy to old age, belong certain peculiar
attachments, certain cares, desires, and
interests; which open not abruptly, but
by gradual advances on the mind, as it
beco~mes fit to receive them, and is pre-
pared for aaing the part to which, in

t'heir

SER M. their order, they pertain. Hence, in the

jVJ, education of a child, no one thinks of in-

s~piring him all at once withtheknowledge,
the s~entiments, and views of a man, and
with contempt for the exercises and amuse-
rnents of childhood. On the contrary,
employments fCuited to his age are allow-
ed to occupy him. By there his powers
are gradually unfolded; and advantage
is taken of his youthful pursuits, to im-
prove and firengthen his mind a till, flep
by flep, he is led on, to higher profpeas,
and prepared for a larger and more im-
portant scene of adion.

This analogy, which so happily illus-

trates the present condua of the Deity
towards man, des~erves attention the more,
as it is the very illuffration uied by the
Apostle, when treating of this fubjeat in
the context. Nowe, fagys he, wee kno~w in
part.---But wh~en that wahich, is perfell is
come, that wehich isr in parrt hall be done
away. When I w~as a child, I Jpoke as a
child, I underf ~ood as a child, I thought as
a child; but when I became a mian, I punt

'awaY

awaUIY chldi/ thiings. For nowre ·ore fee 8 ERv~ ·
through a glasS darkly ; but then, face to c4
face : Nowu I knowe in part ; but then, I
s~hall knowo even as I am knowen. Under
the care of the Almighty, our education
is now going on, from a mortal to an
immortal state. As much light is let in
upon us, as we can bear without injury.
When the objeas becomne too splendid
and dazzl~ing for our light, the curtain
is drawn. Exercised in s~uch a field of
adion, as s~uits the firength of our un-
ripened powers, we are, at the fame time,
by proper profpeAs and hopes, prompted
to aspire towards the manhood of our na-
ture, the time whben chilly things /7ball
be put awreay. But itill, betwixt those
future profpeAs, and the imprefilon of
prefeat objeats, s~uch an accurate propor-
tionr is eftablithed, as on the one hand
thall not produce a total contempt of
earthly things, while we aspire to thos~e
that are heavenly; and, on the other,
thall not encourage su~ch a degree of at-
tachmenlt to our present slate, as would

renlder

SER M* render us unworthy of future advance-

IV. ,c~ll ment. In a word, the whole course of

things is so ordered, that we may nei-
ther by an irregular and precipitate educa-
tion, become men too soon ; nor by a fond
and trifling indulgence, be f~uffered to con-
tinue children for ever.

LE T ther~e refleAions not only remove

the doubts which may aris~e from our
obs~cure knowledge of immortality, but
likewise produce the highest. admiration
of the wisdom of our Creator. The firuc-
ture of the natural wvorld affords innume-
rable instances of profound design, which
no attentive fpedtator can survey withou~t
wonder. In the moral world, where the
workmanship is of much finer andi more
delicate contexture, f~ubjeats of~itill greater
admiration open to view. But admi-
ration muff rife to its h-ighest point,
when thos~e parts of the moral conflitu-
tion, which at first: were reputed ble-
mithes, which carried the appearance of
objeations, either to the wisdom or the

goodness

goodness of Providence, are discovered, SER M.
on more accurate infpedtian, to be ad- V
juffed with the most exquisite propriety.
We have now seen, that the datrknefs of
man's co~ndition is no les~s essential to his
well-being, than the light which he en-
joys. His internal powers, and his ex-
ternal situation, appear to be exadtly fitted
to each other. Those complaints which
we are apt to make, of our limited capa-
city and narrow views, of our inability to
penetrate farther into the future deftinati-
on! of man, are found, from the foregoing
observations, to be juff as unreasonable, as
the childith complaints of our not being
formed with a microscopic eye, nor fur-
nithed with an eagle's wing; that is, of
not being endowed with powers which
would subvert the nature, and counteraa
the laws, of our pres~ent slate.

In order to do juffice to the -fubjeca, I

muff observe, That the fame reafonirw
which has been now employed with re-
fpedt to our knowledge of immortality, is
equally applicable to many other branches

SER M. of intelleatual knowledge. Thus, why

I' .. we are permitted to know so little of the

nature of that Eternal Being who rules the
univers~e; 3why the manner in which he
operates on the natural and moral wor d,
is wholly concealed; why we are kept in
s~uch ignorance, with reipedt to the extent
of his works, to the nature and agency of
fipiritual beings, and even with ref~pedto
the union between our own foul and body:
To all ther~e, and freveral other enquiries
of the fagme kind, which often -employ the
solicitous res~earches of s~peculative men,
the answer is the famne that was given to
the intereffing quefftion which.makes the
fubjeA of our dircourfe, the degree of
'knowledge desired, would prove incom-

patible with the deiign, and with the
pr'oper bufinef's of this life. It would
raise us to a iphere too exalted; would
reveal objea~s tloo great and firiking for
our prelent faculties ; would excite feel-
ings too firong fbr us to bear; in a word,
wvould unfit us for thinking or adting like
human creatures. It is therefore ref~ery-
ed for a more advanced period of our na-

ture ;

ture; and the hand of Infinite wisdom hath S E M.
in mercy drawn a veil over scenes which J
would overpower the fight of mortals.

One inflance in particular, of Divine

wisdom, is to illuffrious, and corresponds
to remarkably with our pref~eat fubjeft,
that I cannot pafCs it over without notice;
that is the concealment: under which Pro-
vidence has placed the future events of
our life on earth. The desire of penetrat-
ing into this unknown region, has ever
been one of the most anxious pafirons of
men. I~t has often seized the wife as well
as the credulous, and given rife to many
vain and impious f~uperflitions throughout
the whole earth. Burning with curiosity
at the approach of some critical event, and
impatient under the perplexity of conjec-
ture and doubt, How cruel is Providence,
we are apt to exclaim, in denying to man
the power of foresight, and in limiting
him to the knowledge of the present mo-
ment? Were he permitted to look forward
into the course of destiny, howv much more

faitably

S ER M. suitably would he be prepared for the vari-

Sous turns and changes in his life! ?With

what moderation would he enjoy his pro-
fperity under the fore-knowledge of an
approaching revers~e ? And with what ea-
ger-ners be prompted to improve the flying
hours, by feeing the inevitable term draw
nigh which was to finish his course

But while Fancy indulges fouch vain de-

fires and criminal complaints, this coveted
fore-knowledg~e must clearly appear to the
eye of reafan, to be the most fatal gift
which the Almighty could-beffow. If in
this prefeat mixed slate all the fuccefirve
fecenes of diffrefs through which we are
to pars, were laid before us in one view,
perpetual s~adness would overcast our life.
Hardly would any transient gleams of in-
tervening joy be able to force their way
through the cloud. Faint' would be the
relish of pleaforses, of which we foresaw
the close~: Ins~upportable the burden of as-
fliaions, under which we were oppressed
by7 a load, not only of present, but of an-
ticipated sorrows. Friends would begin

the rr

their union, writh lamenting the day which BER IIM.
was to dissolve it ; and with weeping eye, ,
the parent would every moment behold
the child whom he knew that he was to
lose. In short, as so~n as that myfierious
yell, which now covers .futurity, was
lifted up, all the gaiety of~ife would dif--
appear j its flattering hopes, its pleasing;
illuffons, would vanish; -and nothing but
its vanity and sadness remain., The fore-
fight of_ the hour of death woluld conti-
nually interrupt the course~ of human as-
fairs; and the overwhelming profpedt of
thle future, i~nflead of exciting men to pro-
p-er adivity, would render them immove-
able with consternation and dismay.---
How much more friendly to man is that
mixture of knowledge and ignorance
which is allotted him in this slate! Igno-
rant of the events which are to befall us,
and of the precise term which is to con-
clude our life, by this ignorance our en-
joyment of pres~ent objeats is favoured;
and knowing: that death is certain, and
that human affairs are full of change, by

this

SER M. this knowledge our attach~ment to those

I objeAs is moderated. Precisely in the fame

manner as, by the mixture of evidence
and obs~curity which remains on the pro-
sped of a future slate, a proper balance is
pres~erved betwixt our love of this life,
and our desire of a better.

The longer that our thoughts dwell on

this f~ubjeat, the more we must be con-
vinced, that in nothing the Divine wisdom
is more admirable, than in proportioning
knowledge to the necessities of man. In-
flead of lamenting our condition, that we
are permitted only to~ee as through a glass
darkly, we have reason to bless our Creator,
no less for what he hath concealed, than
for wh'at he hath allowed us to know. He
is woonderful in cou6nsel, as he is excellent
-in wreorking. 'He is wif~e i'n beart, and his
thoughts are deep. Howra unfearchabl ar-e
th~e riches of the wr~ifom of the knowkldg~e
of' God !

FROM· th~e whole view which- we have

taken of the fubjeat, this important in-

si ru ti on

firudtion arises, That the great design of 8 ER 19.
all the knowledge, and in particular of the ~
religious knowledge which God hath as-
forded us, is, to fit us for dis~charg~ing the
duties of life. No d~elef~s discoveries are
made to us in religion : No discoveries
even of d~eful truths, beyond the precis~e
degree of information, which is f~ubter-
vient to right condue. To this great end
all our information points. In this center
all the lines of knowledge meet. Life and
imlmortality are brousght to ight inr the glpf
pel; yet not so displayed as to gratify the
curiosity of the world with an affonifhing
fpeL7acle; but only so far made known,
as to assist and s~upport us in the pra~tice
of our duty. If the discovery were more
impedfed, it would excite no desire of im-
mortality; if it were more full and firik-
ing, it would render us careless of life.
On the first supposition, no fufficient mno-·
tive to virtue would appear s on the recond
no proper trial of it would remain. In the
one cafe, we thould think and adt like men
who have their portion only in this. wo7rld;

SE R M. in th-e othrer cafe, l'ike men who have no

I concern with this world at all. W~hereas

now, by the wife con~itution of Heaven,
we are placed in the most favourable fitua-
tion for ading, with propriety, our allotted
part here; and ,for rising in due course,
to higher honour and happi~ness hereafter.

Let us then second the kind intentions

of Providence, and aLd upon the plan
which· it hath pointed out. Checking
our inquisitive solicitude abouit what: the
Almightyr hath concealed, let us dili-
gen tly i mprove what h e ath made known.
Inhab~itants ·of the earth, we are at the
fTame time candidates for Heaven. Lo~ok-
irtg upon these as only different views of
onae -confiiient charad~er, let us carry on
our preparation ~for· Heaven, not by ab-
Arading ourselves from the coincerns of
this world, but by fulfilling the duties antd
o~ffices of every Rtation in life. L~iving f-
berly, righ~teously, afnd godliy zin thepre~ft
world~, let us look f or thait blefed hope, and
z~th glo/riOu1S appear-ing of the great GodZ, andZ
ourT Savi~.our Jfefus Ch1rifl.

Before~

Before I conclude, it may be proper to 8 E M.

obfeirve, that the reasonings in this djif- c
course~ give no ground to apprehend' any
danger of our being too much influencedt
by the belief of a future slate. I have
ihown the hurtful effeats which would
follow from too bright and full a dif~overy
of the glory of that slate; and in thewing
this, I have justified the decree of Provi-
dence, which permits no s~uch dis~covery.
But as our nature is at present conflituted,
attached: by to many firong conneations
to the world of sense, and enjoying a corn.
mIunicaItion fob feeble and difiant with- the
world of spirits, we need fear no danger
from cultivating intercourse with the la~tter
as much as possible. On the contrary,
frorn that intercours~e the chief security of
our virtue is to be fought. The bias of
our nature leans to much towards fienfe,
that fromt this fide the peril is to be dread-
ed, and2 on this fide the· defence is to be
providled.

Let us then ·zalk by faith. Let us

firengthen this principle of a~tion to the

VOL. , ]I utmost

E ER M. utmost of our power. Let us implore the

~3 Divine grace to firengthen it within us

more and more . That we may thence de-
rive an antidote againt 1that subtile poison,
which incessant commerce with the obje £s
of fCenfe diffufes through otur fouls; that
we may hence acquire purity and dignity
of manners, suited to our divine hopes 3
and undefiled by the pleasures of the
world, unshaken by its terrors may pre-
serve to the end one conflant te'nor of in-
tegrity. Till at last, having under the
conduct ofChriftian faith, happily finithed
the period of difbipline, we enter on that
slate, where a far nobler s~cene thall open;
where eternal objeats thall thine in their
native splendor; where this twilight of
mortal life being past, the Sun ofrighteouS-
nesS thall rife ; and that whrich5 Isper-feF
·deing come, that wehich is in part /hall be
done C~away.

1 HESE were the wnords of dur blef- SE RII.
fed Lord on a memorable occasion. The ~V
feast of the passover drew nigh, at which
he knew that he was to fufffer. The
night was arrived wherein he~ was to
be delivered into th~e hands of his ene-
mies. He had s~pent the evening in con-
f'erence with his dificiples; like a dying
father in the mjdft of his family, min-
gling consolations with his last infiruc-

ministry. Immediately after, he went
forth with hi~s disciples into ~the garden of

hour ? An h~our the most criticafl,· the:
most pregnant with great events, since
hours had begun to be numbered, since
time had begun to. run. It was the hour
in wh~ich* thme Son of God wras to termi-
nate the labou~rs of his important: life, by
a death flill more imlportant and illuffri-
ous; the hour of atoning, by his f'uffer-

of accomplithing prophecies, types, ~and

never did it thine so bright, as in this lait,

executioner and the cros~s, the scourge, the

this nature his foul was not to be over-
come. It is diftrefzs which eninobles every
great charader; and differfs was to glo-
rify the Son of God.' He was now to
teach all mankind by his example, how
to fuffer and to die. He Iwas to fland
forth before his enemies, as the faithful
writnefs of the truth; juffifying by his
behaviour the ch-aradter w~hich he assumed,
and sealing with his blood the Doatrine
which he taught,

What magnanimity in all his words

and ad ions on this great occasion ! The
court of Herod, the judgment-hall of'
Pilate, the hill of Calvary, were so ~many
theatres prepared for his dis~playing all the
virtues of a conflant and patient mind.
~When led forth to fuffer, the firf1Z voice
wc~hich we hear from him, is a generous
lamentation over the fate of his unfortu,-
pate, though guilty country; and, to the

last

last moment of his life, we behold him in: SE ~M.
poffefilon of the fame gentle and benevo- cy
lent spirit. N~o upbraiding, no complaine
ing expression ereaped from his lips, dur~-
i~ng the long and painful approaches of a
cruel death. ~He betrayed no symptom of
a weak or a vulgar, of a diScomposed or
impatient mind. WVith the utmdit atten-
ti~on of fi~lial tenderness he committed his
aged mothe~r to the care of his beloved
disciple *. With all the dignity of a So-

II. Tm s was the hour in which Christ

atoned for the fins of mankind, and ac-
complifhed our eternal redemption. It
was the hour when that great sacrifice was
offered up, the efficacy of which reaches
back to the first tranfgreffloix of man, and
extends forwardi to the end of' time, the
hour, when from the cros~s, as from an
high altar, the blood was flowing, which
wathed away the guilt of the nations.

This awful dispensa-tion of the Al-

mighty, contains myfieries which are be-
yond the difoovery of man. It is one of
those things into which the angels der~ie to
look. W~hat has been revealed to us, is,
that the d~eath of Christ was the interpo-
fition of Heaven for preventing the ruirr
of human kind. W~e know, that under
~the government of God, miifery is the na-
tural consequence of guilt. After rational

creatures

-SER M. creatures had, by their criminal condud~,

t~c, introdu~ced disorder into the Di~vine king-

<lom, there was no ground to believe, that
by their -penitence and prayers alone,
they could prevent the defic~udion which
·threatened them. 'The prevalence of pro-
pitiatory fadcrifices throughout the earth,
proclaims it to be the .general sens~e of
mankind, that mere repentance was not
of f~ufficient avail .to Rxpiate fin, or to
nFlo its penal zffeats. By the .constant
allutions which- a re carried on in the
New Testament to the faicrifices tunder
the lawv, as pre-fg2nifyijng a great atone-
mnent made by: Christ; and by~ the fironig
.expr~eiSons which are used in d~eferibing
the es seas of hils d~eath, the s~acred vr~iters
thew, as plainly as language allows, that
there was an efficacy in his fiufferings, far
beyond that of mere example an~d in-
firudion. The nature and extent of that
efficacy we are unable, as yet, fully to
trace. Part we are capable of behold-
ing; and the wisdom of what we behold,
we have reafbn to adore. WMe dis~cern in

this

this plan of redemption, the evil of fB S.E M.u
firongly exhibited ; and the juffice of the ~
Divine government awfully exemplified,
in Christ fuffering for sinners. But let
us not imagine, that our present disco-
-veries unrfold the whole influence of the
death of Christ. It is connetted with
causes into which we cannot penetrate.
It produces cons~equences too extensive for
us to explore. G'od's thoughts are not as
our thoughts. ·In all things, we fee onlf in
part; and here, if any where, we fee also
as through a glasS darkly.

This, however, is fully manifeit, that

~redemption is one of the most glorious
works of the Almighty. If the hour of
the creation of the world was great and
illuffrious 4 that hour, when from the
dark and formles~s mass, this fair ryfiem
of nature aros~e at the Divine command;
when the morning fars fang together, and
all the sons of Goa' faclted for joy ; no leis
illuffrious is the hour of the refforation
of the world a the hour when, flrom con-
demnation and misery, it emerged into

happiness

SER M. happines~s and peacec With le~s external

., -,majesty it was attended, but is, on that

account, the more wonderful, that under
an appearance to simple, such great events
were covered..

III. IN this hour, thte long ferieis of

prophecies, viflons, types, anld figures,
~was accomplished. This was the ·centre
in which they a~ll met: This~t~he point,
towards which they had tended and verg-
ed, throughout the course of so many
generations. You beh-old the L~aw and
the Prophets standing, if we may speak
so, at the foot of t'he cross, and ,doing
homage. You hehold IVofes and Aaron
bearing the ark of the covenant; David
and Elijah prese~nti~ng the oracle of teffi-
mony. 'You behold ·all the priests and
s~acrifices, all ·the rights and ordinances,
all the types and symbols, aiffembledi
together, to receive their consummation.
Wiithout the death of Christ, the worthip
and ceremonies of thre 'law would have
remained a pompous, bu·t unmeaning in-

ti~tution.

flitution. In the hour when he was cru- SER ~M.
cified, the book weith the Seuen seals was
opened. Every rite assumed its fignifi-
cancy; every prediaion rnet its event;
every sy~mbol displayed its correspond-

ence.

The dark and seemingly ambiguous

method of conveying important difcove-
ries under figures and emblems, was not
peculiar to the s~acred books. . The Spi-
rit of God, in pre-fignifying the death of
Christ, adopted that plan, according to
which the whole knowledge of those
early ages was propagated through the
world. Under the veil of mysterious al-
lusion, all wis~dom was then concealed.
F~romn the f'enfible world, images were
every where borrowed to deferibe things:
unseen. More was underflood to b~e
meant, than was openly expressed. By
enigmatical rites, the Priest communi-
cated his doatrines; by parables and al-
legories., the Philos~opher inftru~ed his
dfifciples, even' thie Legislator, by figu-
rative s~ayings, commanded the reverence

SER M. of the people. Agreeably to this prevail-

cc~t*ing mode of infiruaion, the whole dif-

penfation of the Old Teitament was so
condudted, as to be the thadow and the
figure of a spiritual fyitem. Every re-
markable event, every diftingulfhed per-
fonage, under the Law, is interpreted in
the New Teitament, as bearing some re-
ferenc~e to the hour of w~hich we treat.
If Is~aac was laid upon the altar as an in-
nocent vidtim ; if David was drivren from
his throne by the wicked, and reffored
by the hand of God; if the brazen s~er-
pent was lifted up, to heal the people s if
the rock was imitten by Mos~es, to furnif h
drink in the wilderness; all were types
of Christ, and alluded to his death.

In prediating the fame event, the lan-

guage' of ancient prophecy was magnifi-
cent, but seemingly contradi610ry : For it
foretold a MlefiTah, who was to be at once
a fufferer and a conqueror. 7'he Star was
to come ouct of racob, and the Branch to
.s~pring from the fem~n of Jefe. 'The Angelof
the Covenant, the Desire of all Nations, weas

to come Juddenly to his temple i and to him 8 ER M.
was to be the gathering of the people. Y et ~r
at the fame time, he was to be dPffiled and
rejetled of men ; he was to be taken from
pryon and f-om judgmlntr, and to be led as
a lamb to theflaurghter. Though he was a
man of forrowres and acquainted wreithl griej;
yet the Gentiles were to come to his light,
and Kings to the brightn5ess of his rijng. In
the hour when Christ died, thos~e prophe-
tical riddles were solved a thos~e seeming
contradiaions were reconciled. TFhe ob-
fcurity of Oracles, and the ambiguity of
types vanished. The Sun ofri~ghteoufne/sr
rose ; and, together with the dawn of reli-
gion, those thadows passed away.

IV. TmTs was the hiour of the abolition

of the Law; and the introdu~tion of the
Gospel; the hour of terminating the old,
and of beginning the new dispensation of
reli giou s knowledge and worth ip, through-
out the earth. Viewed in this light, it
forms the most auguff sera which is to be
found in the history of mankind. When

Christ

SERM. Christ was f~uffering on the crofs,-we are

,'.informed by one of the Evangelists, that he

said, I thirfi, and that they filled a fptinge
with vinegar, and put it to his mouth. As-
ter b5e had taf~d the uainegar, knoweing that
all tbhigs weEre nowe accomphf45ed, and the
scrip~tures fulfiled, he said, It is finifed *;
that is, this offered draught of vinegar
was the last circumflance predidted by an
ancient Prophet -t, that remained to be
fulfilled. The vision and the prophecy
are now sealed : The Mosaic dispensation
is closed. And Be boweed his hEead, and gaue
ucp the ghof.~

It is fmpIed.- W~hen he uttered there

words, he changed the state of the uni-
verse. At that momlent the Law ceased,
and the Gospel- commenced. This was the
ever-memorable point of time, which f~e-
parated the old and the new world from
each other. On one fide of the point of
fieparation, you behold the Law, with its
priests, its sacrifices, and its rites, retiring
from fight. On the other fide, you be-

hold the Golpel, with its simple and ve- SER vI.
nerable inflitutions, coming forward into ~y
view. Significantly was the veil of the
temple rent in this hourj for the glory then
departed from between the cherubims.
The legal High Priest delivered up his
Urim and Thummim, his breast-·plate,
his robes, and his incense: And CaatsT
flood forth as the Great High Priest of all
s~ucceeding generations. By that one fa-
crifice which he nowu offered, he abolished
fagcrifices for ever. Altars on which the
fire had blazed for ages,were nowto rmoke
no more. Vi~tims were no· more to bleed,
Not weith the blood of bulls and goats, but
wi~th his owen blood,· he nowe entered into the
H-oly Place, hrbev to ap~pear in the 1prefencle
of God for us.

This was the hour of association and

unionl to all the worthippers of God.
When Christ said, It i fiinfhed, he threw
down the wall of partition which had so
long divided the Gientile from the Jew.
He gathered into one, all the faithful, out
of every kindred and people. Hie pro-

SER `M. claimed the hour to be come, wrhen the

' knowledge of the true God thould be no

longer confxned to one nation, nor his wor-
thip to one temple a but over all the earth,
the worthippers of the Father thould serve
him lin /piri't and in truthb. From that
hour they who dwelt in the uttermzof ends
of the earth, strangers to the covenant of
promylje, began to be brought nigh. In that
hour, the light of the Gospel dawned
from afar on the British islands.

During a long cours~e of ages, Provi-

dence seemed to be occupied in preparing
the w~orld for this revolution.~ Thre whole
Jewith teconomy was intended to other it
in. The knowledge of God was preserved
unextinguifhed in one corner of the world,
that thence, in due time, might if sue forth
the light which was to oversprea~d the
earth. Succelirve revelations gradunally
enlarged the views of men beyond the nar-
row bounds of~udsea, to a more extensive
kingdom of God. Signs and miraples
awakened their expe~tation, and direated
their eyes towards this great event. .Whe-

ther

ther God descended on the flaming moun- S aH
tain, or s~poke by the Prophet's voice; wyhe-
ther he s~cattered his chosen people into
captivity, or re-assembled them in their
own land; he was itill carrying on a pro-
greffive plan; which was accomplished at
the death of Christ.

Not only in the territories of Israel, but

over all the earth, the great dif~penfations
of Providence refpefted the approach of
this important hour. If empires ros~e or
fell; if war divided, or peace united the
nations; if learning civ-ilized their man-
ners, or philosophy enlarged their views;
all was, by the secret decree of Heaven,
made to ripen the world for that jul-
neJs of time, when Christ was to publish the
whole couns~el of God. The Persian, the
M~acedonian, the Roman Conqueror, en-
tered upon the flage, each at his predi~ted
period ; and, though he meant not so,~ nei-
ther· did his beart think so, miniffered to
this houlr. The revolutions of power, and
the fuccefilon of rmonarchies, w~ere t'o ar-
ranged by Providence, as to facilitate the

V able world, after the day had arrived,

wehen the fton~ e hichi wa~s cut ouct of th~e
mzountatin wzithJout hands, ~Fould become a
great mnountain and fll he earrth*. This
was the day which Abr-aham fawr afar of,
and was glad. This was the day, which
many Prophets and Kings, and righteous
men, desired to fee, but could no~t the day
for which the earnefl expediationz of the crea-
-ture, long oppressed with ignorance, and
bewildered in f~uperflition, might be justly
s~aid to wairrt.

Vi. Tuts was the hour of Chrift's tri-

umph over all the powers of darkness,
the hour in which he overthrew dominions
and thrones, led captivity captive, and
-gave glf'ts u~nto men. T he contest which
the ksingdom of datrknefrs had long mainl-
tained against the kingdom of light, was
now brought to its crisis. The period was
come, when the feed of te woman ~Should
bruise the head of the serpent. For many

ages,

a Dan. ii. 34, 35-

ages, the most gross s~uperstition had filled 8 ER 19.
the earth. 'The glory of th5e uncorruptble
God ·was, every where except in the land
of Jud aa, changed into images4 made like
to corruptible man, and to birds, and Aeaft,
and creepinzg thingl~s. The w~orld, which
the Almighty created for hims~elf, seemed
to have becomne a temple of idols. Even
to; vices and pafflo~ris, altars were rais~ed;
and what was intitled Religion, was in
effedt a discipline of impurity. In the
midit of this unjiverfal d~arknes~s, Satan had
credecd his throne, and the learned and
polifheird, as well as the faivage nations,
bowled down befo-re h'im. But at the hour
when Christ appeared on the cros~s, the
signal of his defeat wias given. His king-
dom su~ddenly departed from him; the
reign of Idolatry passed away: He was he-
eld~ to fall r~

like h'gtnping fr-oi beaven. In

that hour, the foundation of every Pagan
temple ihook. The statue of every ·false
Go6d tottered on its base: The Priest fled
from his falling thrine s and the H-eathen
orad~es became dumb for ever,

As

SER M- As on the cross Christ triumphed ovet

~ Satan, so he overcame his auxiliary, the

world. Long had it assailed him with its
temptations and difcouragements. In this
hour of ·severe trial, he s~urmounted them
all. Formerly he had des~pised the plea-
fures of the world.. He now baffl~ed its
terrors. H-ence he is juffly fCaid to have
crucitied the wr~orld. By his f~ufferings,
h~e ennobled di~stres~s; and he darkened
the: luffre of the pomp and vanities of
life. He dis~covered rto his followers the
path which leads, through affliaion, to
glory and to viatory; and he imparted to
them the f~ame [pirit which enabled him
to ovrercome. MLy kingdom is not of this

the vidtim of this hour. The formidable
appearance of the f~peare remained; but

hour when Christ expiated guilt, he dif~

armed death, by securing the refurreaion 8 EVR M.
of the just. When he said to his peni- -u
tent fellow-f~ufferer, 'I'-day thoul Jhalt be
with me in Paradi/'e, he announced to all
his followers the certainty of heavenly
blis~s. He declared the cherzlims to be
dimiffiied, and the flaming /wze~ord- to be
tiheathied, which had been appointed at
the fall, to keep from man the way of the
I'ree oflife *. Faint, before this period,
had been the hope, indiftina the prof'pedt
which even good men enjoyed of the
heavenly kingdom. Life and immtortality
wreere nowe brought to 7ightf. From the hill
of Calvary, the first clear and certain
view was given to the world of the ever-
lasting manflons. Since that hour, they
have been the perpetual consolation of
believers in Christ. U~nder trouble, they
sooth their minds; amidst temiptation,
they s~upport, their virtue s and, in their
dying moments,~ enable them to f~ay, O

firuti~on. They believed, that they had
entirely s~cattered the small party of his
followers, and had extinguilhed his namne
and his honour for ever. In derition
they addressed him as a King. They
clothed him with purple robes; they
crowned him with a crown of th6;rns;
they put a reed into his hand; and, with:
ins~ulting mockery, bowed the knee before
him. Blind and imirpious men ! H~ow

nion, and 'the inftrumlents o~f irresistible ~
power ! The reed which they put into
his hands, became a rod of iron, with
which he was to brerak in pieces his ene-
mies; a feceptre, with which he was to
r~ule the universe in righteoufners. The
cross, which they thought was to fligma-
tize him with infamy, became the enlign
of his renown. Inficad of being the re-
proach of his followers, it was to be their
boast and their glory. The crof's was to
thine on palaces and chu~rches through-
Out the eairth. It wvas to be assume~d as
the diftinftion of the rnoft powerful mo-

whnen Jerusalem thould be reduced to ash-

fees of this ever-memorable hour. With
all those great events wvas the mind of our
Lord filled, when he lifted up his eyes to
heaven, and said, Fath~er! the houlr is com~e.

From this view which we have taken

of this s~ubject2, permit me to s~uggest, what
ground it affords to confide in the mercy
of God, for the pardon of fin; to truss
to his faithfulnelrs, for the accomplishment
of all his promises; and to approach to
him, with gratitude and devotion, in aats
of worship.

IN the first place, The death of Christ

affords us ground to confide in the Divine
mercy, for the pardon of fin. All the fleps
of that high difpenfagtion of Providence
wyhich we have considered, lead direa~ly
to th!is conclusion. Hfethatfpared not hSj

,V: ., hich it hath reated up for mnen. We

are not left toj dubiozis and intricate rea-
fonings, concerning the co~nd-ua which
God may be expedted to hold towards
his offending creatures. But we are led
to the view of important and illuffrious
fadts, which firike the minid w~ith evidence
irresistible. For, is it poilib~le to believre,
that fo~ch greatt operations as ·I htavfe en-
deavoured to defecribe, Were carried on by
the Almighty in vain .2~ Did he excite, in
the hearts of his creatures, such encou-
raging hopes, without any intention to
fullfil them ?After to long a preparation
of gorodnefis, could he meat>~ to denty for-
givenef~s to the penitent and the humble ?
When, overcome by the sense of guilt,
roan looks upI with an affonifhed eye to
thee Jrufice of his Creator, let him recolledt
that bour of which the Text speaks, and
bie com~forted. Thke signals o-fDivine mer·-
cyi, eredted in his view, are too conf~picu-

IN the next place, The discoveries of SER IV.

this hour afford the highest reason to trqit cv
in the Divine faithfulners~, for the accomrj-
plifhment of every promise which remains
yet unfulfilled. For this was the hour of
the completion of God's ancient covenant.
It: was the performanfce of` the m~ercy pro0-
mifed to thefLthers. We behold the con-
f~ummlation of a greatplan,which through-
out a course of ages, had been uniformly
pursued; and which, againit every hu-
man appearance, was at the appointed
moment, exaetly fulfilled. NVo werd that
as gone out of the mouth of the Lord, }hall
fa~il. No length of time alters his pur-
por~e. No obitacles can retard it. To-
wards the ends accomplished in this hour,
the most repugnant infiruments were
made to operate. We diifcern God bend-
ing to his purpose, -the jarring pafflous,
the opposite interests, and even the vices
of men; uniting s&eeming contrarieties in
his t-heme j making the wera~th of manz to

~J bringing forward this hour, or in com-

pleting its destined effeats. With what
entire confidence ought we to wait for the
fulfilment of all his other promis~es in their
due time; even when events are most
em broiled, and the profpedt is most dif~cou-
raging ? AlthouIgh touu fyef,, fbou c~tan)

LA st s, The considerat~ion of this

wtzhole fu bjea tends-to excite gratitudeand
devotion, when we approach to God in
aac~s of worship. The hour of which I
ha ve discours~ed, presents him to-us in the
amiable light of the Deliverer of mankind,
the Refforer of our forfeited hopes. W'e
b~ehold the greatness~ of the Almighty,
softened by the mild radiance of coande-
,reedinon and merev. We~T behold him di-

miniihing

minifhing the awful diifance at which we 8 E1R M.
fland from his presence, by appointing for ~
us a Mediator and Intercessor, through
w~hom the humble may, without difmnay,
approach to Him who made them. By
firch views of the Divine na tu re, Christian
faith lays the foundation for a worship
w~hich th~all be at once rational and affec-
tionate; zaworthip, in which the light of
thle underflanding shall concur with the
devotion of the heart, and the most pro-
found reverenr-ce be united with the most
cordial love. Christ~ian faith is not a fyfi-
tem of speculat-ive truths. It is not a les-
son of moral infiru~tion only. By a train
of high discoveries which it reveals, by a
f'uccefiron of intereffing objedts whichr it
places in our viewY, it is calculated to ele-
vate the mind, to purify the affeaipns,
and, by the affifiance of devotion, to con-
firm and encourage virtue. Such, in par-
ticular, is the scope of that divine infli-
tution, the· Sacrament of our Lord's Sup-,
per. To0 this happy purpose let it con-
duce, by concentring, in one firiking

pont:

SEVRM* point of light, all that the Gospel has dif-

cc~ played of what is most important to man.

Touched with juff contrition for past of-
fences, and filled with a grateful fednie of
Divine goodness, let us come to the altar
of God; and, wit~h a humble faith in his
infinite merciles, devote ourfrelves to his

terminates in felfithnefs; the other, in
charity. The one is fullof~frzJfeand bit-
ter' enlVYings ; the other, of mercy and of'
good fritzis. One of the chief charaders
by which th'e wisdom fr~om above is dif-
tinguifhedi, is gentleness, of which I arn
now to discourse. Of this there is the
greater occalion to discourse, becaus~e it is
too se~ldom viewed in a religious light;
and is more- readily considered by the
bulk of men, as a mere felicity of nature,
or an exterior accomplithment of man-
ners, than as a Chrfitian virtue which
they are bound to cultivate. I thall first
explain the nature of this virtue; and
th~alil then o~ffer some arguments to recomn-
m-rend, and some direaions to ~facilit~ate,
J7-e pradcice of it.

% BEGIN

I BE GIN with diftinguithing true gen- SE .~~M

tlenefs from passive tamenes~s of ipirit, ~4
and from unlimited compliance with the
manners of others. That pailive tame-
ness which s~ubmits, without fir~uggle, to
every incroachment of the violent and as-
fuming, forms no part of Christian duty;
but, on the contrary, is deftw aive of
general happiness and order. That unli-
mited complaisance, which on every oc-
cafion, falls in with the opinions and
manners of others, is to far from being a.
virtue, that it is i~tself a vice, and the pa-
rent of many vices. It overthrows all
fleadinefs of principle . and produces that
sinful conformity with the world, which
taints the whole charadter. In the pre-
fient corrupted Aate of human manners,
always to assent and to comply, is the
very wort~ maxim we can adopt. It is
impossible to support the purity and dlig-
nity of Christian morals, without oppof-
ing the world on various occasions, even
though we thould stand alone. That
gentlener~s therefore which belongs to vir-

SE M. teue, is to be carefully distinguished from

--~the mean spirit of cowards, and the fawn-

ing assent of sycophants. It renounces no
juff right from fear. It gives up no im-
portant truth from flattery. It is indeed
not only consistent with a firm mi~ndj but
it nece~ssarily requires a manly spirit, and
a fixed principle, in order to give it any
real value. Upon this foid ground only,
the poliih of gentlenes~s can w~ith advan-
tage be fuperinduced.

It flands oppos~ed, risot to the most dle-

termined regard for virtue and truth, but
to harthnefs and fevuerity, to pride and
a~rrogance, to violence and oppreffl~on.
It is properly, that part of the great
virtue of charity, which .makes us un-
willing to give pain to any of our bre-
thren. CompafiTon prompts (2s to relieve
their wants. Forbearance prevents us
from retaliating thleir injuries. M~/eekneis
reflrains our angry pafflons a candour, our
severe judgments. Gentleness correets
wvhatever is offenfive in our manners,
and by a conflant train of humane alt-

tentions,

tent ions, Ru dies to alleviate the burden of s8 %-
common mni-ery. Its o~fice, therefore, is ~
extensive. It is not, like some other vir-
tues, called forth only on peculiar emer-
gencies; but it is continually in sation,
wihen we. are engaged in intercourse with
men. It ought to form our addrefis, to re-
gulate our. s~peech, and to diff~ufe itself
over our whole behaviour.

I nuRt warn· you however not to

confound this gentle wi/dom~ whrich 's from
above, with that artificial courtesy, that
fludied imooth~nef~s of manners, which is
learned in the school of the world. Such
accomplihmnents, the most frivolous and
em~pty may possess. Too often they are
employed by the artful, as a ihare; too
often affeded by the hard and unfeel-
ing, as a cover- to the bas~eness of their
minds. We cannot, at the fCame time,
avoid observing the homage, which, even
in s~uch initances, the: world is confirain-
ed to pay to virtue. In order to ren-
der society agreeable, it is found necef-
fary to assume somewhat, that may at

leaif:

SER M. Jeaft carry its appearance. Virtue is the

-·universal ·charm. Even its thadow is

courted when the f~ubflance is wanting.
The imitation of its form has been re-
duced into an art; and in the commerce
of life, the first fludy.of all who would
either gain the eficem, or win the hearts
of others, is to learn the speech, and to
adopt the manners, of candour, gentle-
ness and humanity. But that gentleness
which is the charadteriffic of a good
man, has, like every other virtue, its
feat in the heart. And let me add, no-
thing except what flows from the heart,
can render even external manners truly
pleasing. .For no ass~umed behaviour can
at all times hide the real charader. In
that unafFe~ted civility which fpirings
from a gentle mind, there is a charm
infinitely more pow~erful, than in all the
fludied manners of the most finithed
couartier.

True gentlenes~s is founded on a sens~e

of what we owe to him who made us,
and to the commori nature of which we

all share. It arises from refleaion on our 8 EdM.
own failings and wants; and from juffc
views of the condition, and the duty of
man. It is native feeling, heightened and
improved by principle. It is the heart
which easily relents; which feels for every
thing that is human i and is backw~ard
and flow to infliat the least wound. It is
affable in its address, and mild in its de-i
meanour; ever ready to oblige, and will-
ing ·to be obliged by others; breathing
habitual kindnefrs towards friends, cour-
ter'y to firangers, long-f~uffering to: ene-
mies. It exercis~es authority with mode-
ration; adminiffers reproof with tender-
ness J confers favours with ease and mo-
defly. It is unafiruming in opinion, and
temperate in zeal. It contends not ea-
gerly about trifles; flow to contradiat, and
still flower to blame a but prompt to
allayp dissention, and to reffore peace. It
neither intermeddles unneceffairily with
the affairs, nor pries inquisitively into the
secrets of others. It delights above all
things to alleviate difirers, and if it can-

not

SEM- not dry up the falling tear, to sooth at
~cJ least the grieving heart. Where it has

not the power of being of~eful, it is niever
burdensome. It s~eeks to please, rather
than to thaine andldazzle; and conceals
with care, that su~pe~riority, either of ta-
lents or of rank, which is appreffive to
thof'e who are beneath it. In a wiord, it
is that ifipirit, and that tenor of manners,
wvhich· th~e goipel of Christ enjoins-, when
it· commands us to bear oane anothrer's bur-·
dens ; to rejoice wiorth those weho rejoice, arid to
·weep wzeith those who w~eeep i to please every
one birnPeighbour for his g~ood; to be kind and
tend~er-heartedj; to be piit~fulatndcourteoau s;
to ft~pport thep weak, and to -be ~patint
t~owardlls all' me1n.

Having now fufficiently explained the

nature of this amiable virtue, I proceed to
recomnmend it to your pradice. Let ine, for
this end, desire you to confider the duty
w-·hich youl owe to G~od; to confider the
relation which you bear to one another;
to conifider your own interest.:

~L, o universally rememberedftha t the Apostle

Paul, on occasion of a request which he
makes to the Corinthians, uses those re-
markable expref sians *, Ibefch you by the
meekne/s and gentlene/s ofChrifl. During
all his intercourse with men, no hadhfnefs,
or pride, or flately difiance, appeared in
his demeanour. In his accers,he was eafyr;
in his manners, simple; in his anfwvers,

the ihfpirer of gentleneifs. His name is

And suitable to fu ch difcoveri es, is the whole

appeal to any single precept. You need SEV~X
only open the New Testament to find cv
this virtue perpetually inculcated. Cha-
rity, or love, is the capital figure ever
prerented to our view; and gentleness,
forbearance, and forgiveness~, are the
founds ever r~ecurring on our ear.

So predominant, indeed, is this ipirit

throughout the Christian dis~pensation,
that even the vices and corruptions of
men have not been able altogether to
defeat its tendency. Though that dif-
penfagtion is far from having hitherto pro-
duced its full effeat upon the world,
yet we can clearly ti-ace its influence, in
humanising the manners of men. Re-
mnarkable in this refpea, is the vi~tory
which it has gained over those powers of
violence and cruelty, which belong to the
infernal kingdom. Wherever Chriftiani-
ty prevails, it has difrcouraged, and, in
some degree, abolithed slavery. It has
rescued human nature from that ignomi.-
nious yoke, under which, in former ages,
the one half of mankind groaned. It has

introducedf

SE R M. introduced more equality~between the two

f. iexes, and rendered the conjugal union
more rational and happy. It has abated
the ferocioufhefs of: wiar. It has miti-
gated the rigour of despot~ism, mitigated
the cruelty of puniihrnents; in aword,
has reduced mankind, from their ancienrt
barbarity, into a more humnane and gentle
ftate.-Dlo we pretend. re~fped and zeal
for this religion, and at the fame time
allow ours~elves. in that harihnefrs and f~e-
verity, which are so contradiaory to its ge-
nius ? Too plainly we show, that it has no
powe~r over our hearts. We may retain
the Ch~riti~an name; but we have aban-
dotted the Christian fCpirit.

sI. CONSIDER the relation which you

bear to one another. M/an, as a solitary
individual, is a very wretched being.

kind, he is poffeffed, neither of happiners,
nor of' firength. We are formed: by -na-

sand conne~lions, founded on common
wants. Gentleness therefore, or, as it is
very properly termed, humanity, is what
man, as ftuch, in every Ration, owes to
man. To bte inaccessible, contemptuous,
and hard of heart, is to revolt against
our own nature; is, in the language of
Eicripture, to hide su/refeles from~~ our o~ron
~feJhS. Accordingly, as all feel the claim
which they have to mildnes~s and huma-
mity, so all are sensibly hurt by the want
of it in oth1e~rs. O:n no fi~de are we more
vulnerabk~. No complainlt is more feel-
ingly made, than that of the harth and
rugged manners of persons with- whom
we h~ave in~tercours~e. But how seldom do
we transfer the cause to ourselves, or exa-
mine how far we are guilty of infli~ting on
others, whos~e sensibility is the fame with
ours, those very wounds of which we to
loudly complain ?

But, perhaps, it will be pleaded by

some, that this gentknefs, on which we

offices

8 ER M* offices ~f life, which in their eye are not

V essential to religion and goodness. Ne-

gligent, they confers, on flight occations,
of the government of their temper, or
the regulation of their behaviour, they
are attentive, as they pretend, to the
great duties of beneficence; and ready,
whenever the opportunity presents, to
perform important s~ervices to their fel-
low-creatures. But let such persons re-
fled that the occaflons of performing
those important good deeds, -very rarely
occur. Perhaps their situation in life, or
the nature of their connedions, may in
a great measure exclude them from fach
opportunities. Great events give [~cope
for great virtues; but the mean tenor of
humnan life, is composed of small occur-
rences. Within the round of there, lie
the materials of. the happiness oflmoft
m~en ; the fubjeats of their duty, and
the trials of their virtue. Virtue muff
be formed and supported, not by unfre-
qluent :aas, but by daily and repeated ex-
eltions. In order to its becoming; either

vigorous

vigorous or useful, it muff be habitually SE ~M.
adtive; not ibreaking forth occasionally ~~
with a. tranfienrt luffre, 1ike the blaze of the
comet; but regular in its returns, like ·the
light of day : Not like. the: aromatic gale,
which sometimes seas ts the sense;· but like
the ordinary breeze which purifies the air,
and renders it healthful.

Years may pass over our heads, without

affording any opportunity for aas of
high beneficence, or extensive utility.
Whereas not a day passes, but: in the
common tranfadtious of life, and efpeci-
ally in the intercourse of domestic facie-
ty, gentlenes~s finds place for promot-
ing the happinelrs of others, and for
firengthening in ourselves the habit of
·virtue. Nay, by seasonable discoveries
of a human s~pirit, we iometimes contri-
bute more materia~lly to the advancement
of happiners, than by adtions which are
fetemingly ·more important. There are
situations, not a few, in human life,
where the encouraging reception, the
condescending behaviour, and the look

8 ER M. of sy~mpathy, bring greater relief to the

vIL. heart, than the most bountif ul gift. While,

on the other fiide, when the hand of libe-
rality is extended to beffow, the want of
gentleness is f~ufficient to fruffrate the in-
tendion of the benefiit. WMe four those
whom we mean to oblige; and, by con-
ferring ~favours with oftenitationandharth-
ness, we convert them into injuries. - Can
any difpolition then: be held to poffers~ a
low place in thei feale of virtue, whoib in-
fluence is to considerable on the happinrefs
of the world ?

Gentleness is, in truth, the great avte-

nue to mutual enjoyment. Amidst the
fIrife of interfering interests, it tempers
the violence of contention, and keeps a-
live the feeds of harmony1. It softens ani-
mofities ; renews endearments; and ren-
dlers the countenance of man~, a refreth-
ment to man. Banish g~entleners from
the earth; suppose the world to be fill-
ed wyith none but harthi and conitentious
fpiryits; and what fort of society would
yemlain ? TFhe solitude of the defart were

repres~entations of such assemblies of men.

then let me desire you,

III. To confider your own int~erest.

Whatever ends a good man can be sup-
posed to pursue, gentleness will be found
to favour them. It prep~offeffes and wins
every heart. It persuades, when every
other argument fails; often disarms the
fierce, and3 melts the flubborn. Wh~ereas
harihneis confirms the oppoiition it would
subdue s and, of an indifferent pers~on,
creates an enemy. He who could over.
Took an injury committed in the collition
of interests, will long and severely resent
the flights ofa contemptuous behaviour.--
To thle man of gentlene~ss, the world is ge.
nerally dis~posed to ascribe every other good
quality. The higher endowments of the
mind! we admire at a difiance; and when
any impropriety of: behaviour accompanies
them, wre admire wlithout love. TThey are
tlke fomne of the difiaint stars;, whiole bene-

ficial

ficrial influence reaches not to us. WThere- S E ~M.
as, of the influence of gentleness, alli inJ
some degree partake, and therefore all love
it. The man of this charader rises in the
world without firuggle, and flourishes
without envy. His misfortunes are uni-
verfally lamented, and his failings are ea-
fily forgiven.

But whatever may be the effedt of this

virtue on our exrter~nal ciondition, its influ-
ence on our mnternal enjoyment is cer-
tain and powerful. That: inward tran-
quillity which it promotes, is the first
requisite to every pleas~urable feeling. It
is the calm and clear atmorphere, the fe1-
renity and funfhinle of the mind. W~hen
benignity and gentleness reign within, we
are always least in hazard of being ruf-
fled from without s evtery person, and
every occurrence, are beheld in the aloft
favrourable light. But, let fomne clouds of
difguff and ill-humour gather on the minds
and immediately the f~cenei changes: Na-
ture feemas transformed; and the ap-
pearance of all things ~is blackened to our

M 2 view.

S ER M. view. The gentle mind is like the smooth

V' ·iream, which refleats every objea in its

juit proportion, and in its faireif colours.
The violent spirit, like troubled waters,
renders back the images of things diitort-
ed and broken; and communicates to
them all, that disordered motion which a-
rises solely from its own agitation.

Ofencesmji ~come. As soon may the

waves of the s~ea ceas~e to roll, as provo-
cations to airie from human corruption
and frailty. Attacked by great injuries,
the man of mild and gentle [pirit will
feel what human nature feels; and will
defend and resent, as his duty allows him.
B~ut to those flight provocations, and fri-
volous offences, which are the moit fre-
quent caus~es of disquiet, he is happily
s~uperior. Hence his days flow in a fhr
more placid tenour than those of others;
exempted from the numberles~s dif~com-
pof~ures which agitate vulgar minds. In-
fpyired with higher sentiments, taught to
regard, with indulgent eye, the frailties
of men, the omifflons of the careless, the

follies

follies of the imprudent, and the levity of S E M.~Y
the fickle, he retreats into the calmness of ~
his [pirit,as into an undisturbed fagn~uary,
and quietly allows the usual cqrrent of life
to hold its cours~e.

This virtue has another, and still more

important conneaion with our interest, by
means of that relation which our preilent
behaviour bears to our eternal state.
Heaven is the region of gentleness and
friendship-, Hell, of fiercenes~s and animo-
fity. If then, as the icripture infiruds us,
according to wh~~at wre nowze fow~e wee may?~
hereafter reap a it follows, that the culti-
vation of a gentle temper is necessary to
prepare us for heavenly felicity; and that
the indulgence of harth difpofitioris, is the:
introduation to future misery. Mlen, I
am afcraid, too often se~parate thos~e arti-
cles of their belief which relate to eternity,
from the ordinary affairs of the world.
They conned them with the seasons of
s~eriousnes~s and gravity. They leave them
with much rep~edt, as in a high region,
to which, only on great occasions, they

refPort ;

8 Ev M. resort; and when they defeiend inlto com-

~iylJmdn life, confider thernfelves as at li-

berty to give free ihope to their humours
and Pafi~fl ons WShereas, in faA, it is their
behaviour in the daily train of social in-
ttercourfe~, which, more than' any other
callfe, fixes and determines their s~piritual
charaer, gradually instilling those dif-
politions, and forming those habits, wthich
affedt their evrerlaiting condition. With
regard to trifles,· perhaps their malig-
nant difpolitions may chiefly be indulged.
But let them remember wetll, that those
trifles, by increasing the growth of pee-
vifhnefs; and pafflon, become pregnant
w~ithl the most ·serious mifc~hiefs ; and may
fit them, before they are a~tvate, for be-
ing the future companio~ns of none bult
infernal [pirits.

I mean not to fay, that in order to ou~r

preparation for Heaven, it i's enough to
be mild and gentle a or that this.virtec
alone, will cover all our fins. Through
the felicity of natural conflitution, a cer-
tain degree of this benignity may be pof-

freined

sessed by fame, whose hearts are in other. 8 EvdKM
refpe~ts corrupt, and their lives irregular. cv
But what I mean to aftert, is, that where
no attention is given to the government
of temper, meetner~s for Heaven is not
yet acquired, and the regenerating power
of religion is as yet unknown. One of
,t3he first works' of the ~spirit of God, is,
to infuse into every heart which it inha-
bits, that gentle werydom wh~ich is from2
above. They wzeho are Chriff have cruci-
f~ed ~rthe rjh, with i'ts afelins anda lujs;
but let it not be forgotten, that among
the Iworks of the fejh, hatred, *varianzce,
emulations, Cwrath, frrfe, and enuyings, are
as expressly enomnerated, as uncleannfSJ,
mlurders, drunkenne/s, and reveling*." They
who continue either in the one or the
other, Jhal'l not inherit, indeed cann~ot in-
herit the Ki~ngdtom of God.

Ha~ving thus thown the importance of

gentleness, both as a moral virtue, and as
a Christian grace, I thall conclude the
lfubjedt, with briefly s~uggesting; some c~on-

VI. State the pradice· of it.

FOR this end, let me advise you to

view your charaAer with an impartial eye;
and to learn from your own failings, to
give that indulgence which in your turn
you claim. It is pride which fills the
w~sorld with so mluch harshness~ and feve-
rity. In the fulness of felf-eftimation, we
forget what we are. We claim attenti-
ons, to which we are not entitled. We are
rigorous, to offences, as if we had nevrer
offended ; unfeelin~g to diffrefs, as -if we
knew not what it was to f~uffer. From
thos~e airy regions of pride and folly, let
us desc~end to our proper level. Let us
fu rvey· the natu ral equali ty on whbich· Pro-
vidence has placed man with man, and
refledt on the infirmities common to all.
If the refleC-ion on natural equality and
mutual offences be infufficient to prompt
humanity, let us at: least rem~ember what
we are in the fight of God. Have we
none of that forbearance to give to one

another,

another, which we atll to earnefily intreat SER ~M.
from Heaven ? Can we look for clemency
or gentleners from our Judge, when we
are to backward to thow it. to our own
brethren ?

Accustom yourselves, also, to refiedt on

the imall moment of those things which
are the usual incentives to violence and
contention. In the ruf~fed and angry
hour, we view every appearance through
a falfTe medium. The most inrconfiderable
point of interest or honour, fwvells into a
momentous obj~ea, and the slightest at-
tack seems to threaten immediate ruin.
But after pafflon or pride has s~ubsided, we
look round in vain fbr the mighty mif-
chiefs we dreaded. The fabric, which
our diflurbed imag~ination had reared,
totally disappears. But thouh the cause
of contention hias dwindled away, its
consequences remain. We have alienated
a f'riend ; we have embittered an enemy ;
we have sown the feeds of future fui~pi-
dion, malevolence or difguf·.--Surpend
cou~r v·iolence, I beseech you, for a mo-

m~~e nt

SE R IV rnent when caules of discord occur. An-

- ~ ticipate: that period of coolness, which, of

itself, will fooii arrive. Alow yours~elves
to think, how little you have any profpedt
o~f gaining by fierce contention a but how
much of the true happistefs of life you
are certain of throwing away. Easily,
and from the s~mallest chink, ·the bitter
waters of firife are let forth ( but their
course cannot be foreseen s and he ieldom
fails of fuffering most from their poifbonus
effe £s, woho firfti allowed them to flow.

But gentleners will, moflt of all be pro-

moted by frequent views of those great
objeas which our holy religion prefeats.
Let the proifpeas of immortality fill your
minds. Look upon this world as a Itate·
of pafra ge. Confider yours~elves as en-
gaged in the pursuit of higher interests;
as ading now, under the eye of God, an
introdud~ory part to a more important:
scene.. Elevated by such sentiments, your
muinds wtill become calm and sedate. YTou
will look down, as from a superior fla-
tion, on th~e petty diflurbances of the

w7orld.

world. They are the f~elfith, the fentual, aS VM.
and the vain, who are morft f'ubjea~ to the _
impotence of passion, They are linked
to clos~ely to the world; by to many sides
they touch every obijeat, anld every per-
son around them, that they are perpetu-
ally hurt and perpetually hurting others.
But the spirit of true religion removes
us to a proper difiance from the grating
objeats of worldly contention. It leaves
us f~ufficiently connedted with the world,
for mating our part in it w~ith propriety;
but dis~engages us from it so far, as
to wyeaken its power of diflurbing our
tranquillity. It inspires magnanimity; and
magnanimity- always breathes gentleness.
It leads us to view the follies of men with
pity, not with rancour; and to treat, with
the mildness of a superior nature, what
in little minds would call forth all the bit-
terner~s of pafflon.

Aided by such considerations, let us

cultivate that gentle w~isdom which is, in
so many- refped~s, important both to our
diuty and our happineis. Let us assume

SER M. it as the ornament of every age, and of

~ every flation. Let it temper the petu-

Jance of youth, and soften the moros~e-
ness ofold age. Let it mitig~ate authority
in those who rule, and promote deference
among those who obey. I conclude with
repeating the caution, not to mifiake for
true gentlene~s, that flimsy· imitation of
it, called polished manners, w~hich often,
among men of the world, under a
fmnooth appearance conceals much alpe-
rIty. Let yours ·be native gentlenes~s of
heart, flowing from the love of God, and
the love of man. Unite this amiable fpi-
r-it with a proper zeal for all that is right,
and juff, and true. Let piety be combin-
ed ·in your charader with humanity. Let
determined integrity dwell in a mild and
gentle breast. A charader thus support-
ed wi;ll command more real refp~ea, than
can be procured by the most thining ac-
complifhments, when separated from vir-

THE SE are the words of one, who, SERM. VII.
though high in flation and power, con- ~
sessed himself to be miserable. They re-
late to a mnemorable occurrence in the
Persian hiflory, under the reign of Aha-
f~uerus, who is supposed to be the Prince
known among the Greek hifforians by the
name of Artaxerxes. Ahasuerus had ad-
vanced to the chief dignity in his king-
dom Haman an Amalekite, who inherit-
ed all the ancient enmity of his race to

the

SE M- the Jewith nation. He appears, from
.~ what is recorded of him, to have been a

very wicked miniffer. Rais~ed to greatness
without merit, he employed his power
solely for the gratification of his pailions.
As the honours which he poffeffed were
next to royal, his pride was every day fed
with that servile homage which is pecu-
liar to Asiatic courts ; and all the s~ervants
of the King proffrated thems~elves be-
fore him. In the midst of this general
adulation, one person only flooped not to
Haman. This was Mordecai the Jew;
who, knowing this Amalekite to be an
enemy to th~e people of God, .and, with
virtuosus indignation, despising that info-
lence of prosperity; with which he fasw
him lifted up, lowreed noPt, nor did him re-
unerence. ~On this appearance of difte-
sped2 from Mordecai, MHaman was fullPJ
wir-ath:= But be thought se~ra rno ~lay~ hads
on MCordecai alone. Personal revenge w~as
not fulfficient to satisfy him. .So vior3lent
and black wvere his pafiarns, that he re-
folJved to exte-rminate .the wvhole nation to

w~hich

wohich Mordecai belonged. Ab~tufing, for SE Rb
this cru'el purpose, the favour of his cre- ..
dulous fevereign, he obtained a decree to
be sent forth, that against a certain day,
all the Jews throughout the Persian do-
minions thould be put to the sword.
Mean while, confident of s~uccess, and
blind to approaching ruin, he continued
extilting in his~ prosperity. Invited by
Ahas~uerus to a royal banquet, which
Esther the Qpe~en had prepared, · he went
fortht th~a day joyfurl, and with- a glad heoart.
But behold how iflight an incident was
fu~fficient to poison his joy ! As he went
forth, he saw Mordecai in the King's
gate'; and obf'erved, that ftill~he refused
to do him homage : ;He food, not up~, nor-
wa~rs moved for him ; al though he well
knew the formidable designs which Ha-
man was preparing to execute. One pri-
va~te man, who derp~ifed his greatness,
and difdained f~ubmifiron, while a whole
kiingdom trembled before him : one spirit,
which the utmost fietch of his power
could neither subdue nor humble, blasted

h.is

8 ER M. his triumphs. His whole fool was

tI' haken with a florm ofpaflon. Wrath,
pride, and desire of revenge, rose into
fury. With difficulty he restrained him-
self in public; but as soon as he came
to his own house, he was forced to dif~-
close the agony of his mind. He gather-
ed together his friends and family, with
Zerith his wife. He told themt of the glory
of his riches, and the mul/titude of his chil-
dren, and all theI things wreherein the Kinrg
had promoted himn, and howe be had advuanci
ed him abov02e the Princes and fevuants of
the King. He said, moreover, T~ea, Eliber
the Queen di'd let no man come in w~ith the
King, unt1o the banquet, that }he had pre-
pared, but m~yself and to-mforrowr also am I
invited unto her ·with the King. After all
this preamble, wvhat is the conclusion ?-
Tet al~l this aevaileth me nothing, foj long as
I fee Mordecai the Jew fitting at the
King s <rte.

Thee sequel of Haman's hiflory I thall

not now pursue. It might atfford matter
for much infiru~tion, by the con~fpicu-

ous juff ice of God in his fall and punish- S8Pf
ment. But contemplating only the fin- Yu-
gular situation in which the Text pres~ents
him, and the violent agitation of his
mind which it displays, the following
refleftions naturally arise, which, toge-
ther with some prad~ical improvements,
thall make the fubjea of this discourse.
J. HIow miserable is vice, when one guilty
passion creates so much torment!i II. How
unavailing is prosperity, when, in the
height of it, a fngle dis~appointment can
defiroy the relish of all its pleasures ! III.
How weak is human nature, which, in
the absence of real, is thus prone to form
Sto itself imaginary woes !

I. How miserable is vice, when one

guilty pafflon is capable of creating so
much torment ! WNhen we dis~course to
you of the internal misery of sinners j
when we represent the pangs which they
f~uffer, from violent pafflons, and a cor-
rupted heart; we are fometimnes furpeade
of chufing a theme for declamation, and

VO onI. Nof

8 ER M. OP" heightening the piAiure which we:

c~ draw, by colours borrowed fromn fancy.

They whol~e minds are, by nature, hap-
pily tranquil, or whose situation in life
removes them from the diflurbance and'
tumult of pafiron, can hardly conceive,
that as long as the body is at eas~e, and
the external condition prosperous, -any
thing which passes within the mind
thould cause such exquisite woe. But,
for the truth of our assertions, we appeal
to the 'hiftory of mankind. We might
reason from the conflitution of the ra-
tional frame; where the understanding is
appointed to be supreme, and the pafflons
to be subordinate 3 and where, if this due
arrangement of its parts be overthrown,
mifiery as necessarily eniiues, as pain is
confeqjuent in the animal frame, upon
the diflortion of its members. But lay-
ing speculations of this kind aside, it is
fufficient to lead you to the view of f~adts,
the import of which can neither be con-
troverted, nor mistaken. This is, indeed,
the great advantage of hiffory, that it is,

a mir-

a mirror which holds upJ mankind to their S8 RM-
own view. For, in all ages, human na- -,
ture has been the fame. In the circle of
worldly affairs, the fame charaaters and
situ ations are perpetu ally returni ng; and i n
the follies and pafirons, the vices and
crimes, of the generations that are past,
we read those of the present.

Attend then to the instance now be-

fore us 3 and conceive, if you can, a per-
son more thoroughly wretched, than one
reduced to make this humiliating confeffi-
on, that though s~urrounded with power,
opulence and pleasure, he was loft to all
happineirs, through the fierceness of his
resentment; and was at that moment
flung by disappointment, and torn by
rage, beyond what he could bear. All
this availeth me nothing, so long as I Sfee
Mordecai the Jew oJifttig· at the Kzing's gate.
Had this. been a soliloquy of Haman's
within himself, it would have been a fuff~i-
cient discovery of his misery. But when
we confider it as a confefiron which he
makes to others, it is a proof that his

NJ 2 misery

SER 20 mi~sery was become insu~pportable. For

~ ifuch agitations of the mind every man

firives to conceal, because he knows theyi
dith~onour him. Other griefs and for-
rows, he can with freedom, poor out to
a confident. WNhat hne f~uffers from the
injuffice or malice of the world, he is not
athamed to acknowledge. But when his
f~uffering arises from the bad difpolitions
of his own heart , when, in the height·
of pros~perity, he is rendered miserable,
fholely by dis~appointed! pride, every ordi-
nary motive for communication ceases.
Nothing but the violence of anguish, can
drive him to confess a pafia~n which ren-
ders him odious, and a weakness which
renders him despicable. To what ex-
tremity, in particular, must he be re-
duced, before he can disclose to his own
family the- infamous beret of his misery ?
In the eye of his family every man withes
to appear refpe £able, and to cover from
their knowledge whatever may vilify or
degrade him. Attacked or reproached
abroad, he consoles himself with his im-

portance

portance at home s and in domestic at- 8 EVR M.
tachment and refped, seeks for some com- c-
penfation for the injuffice of the world.
Judge then, of the degree of torment
which Haman endured, by its breaking
through all there restraints, and forcing
him to publish his thame before those,
from whom all men fb~ek most to hide it.
How s~evere muff have been the confliat
which he underwent within himself, be-
fore he called together his wife and all
his friends for this purpos~e How dread-
ful the agony he fuffered at the moment
of his confeffion, when, to the affaniihed
company, he laid open the cause of his
diffrefs !

Assemble all the evils which povertyP,

diseas~e or violence can infliat, and their
flings will be found by far les~s pungent,
than thos~e which such guilty pafflons dart
into the heart. Amidf1 the ordinary cala-
·mities of the world, the mind can exert
its powers, and suggest relief : And the
mind is properly the man; the f~ufferer,
and his fuffterings, can be distinguish~ed.

'But

S E1M. But those disorders of passion, by feiz-

;VII. ., ing direatly on the mind, attack hu-

man nature in its firong hold, and cut
off its last refource."' They penetrate to
the very feat of fenfa~ction ; and convert all
the powers of thought into infiruments of

torture.

Let us remark, in the event that is now

before us, the awful hand of God; and
admire his juff~ice, In thus making the
finner's ownr wie~ckednefs to reprove him2, and
his back/lidinzgs to corre& bim., Sceptics
reason in vain againit the reality of di-
vine governmlent. It is not: a f~ubjedt of
dispute. It is a faA which carries the
evidence of fenf~ie, and disp~lays its~elf be-
fore our eyes. We fee the Almighty ma-
nifeftly pursu~-ing the finner wceith evil. We
fee him conneding with every single de-
viation from duty, those wounds of the
spirit which occasion the most exquisite
torment. He hath not merely promul-
gated his laws now, and delayed the dif~-
tribution of rewards and punithments
until afuture period of being. But the

fadnalons

fanaions of his laws already take place; SEvR M/.
their effees appeari and with such ins- i-
nite wifdlom are they contrived, as to
require no other executioners of juffice
against the finner, than his own guilty
passions. God needs not come forth from
his secret place, in order to bring him to
puniihment. He need not call thunder
down from the heavens, nor rais~e any
min~ifer of wrath from the abyss below.
He needs only fay, EphSraim is joained to his
idols~; let h5im alone : And, at that: instan~t,
the finner becomes his own tormentor.
The infernal fire begins, of itself, to kin-
dle within him. The worm that never
dies, seizes on his heart.

Let us remarkr also, from this example,

how imperfee~ly we can judge fr~om ex-
ternal appearances, concerning real hap-
pinefs or misery. All Persia, it is pro-
bable, envied Haman as the happiest per-
s~on i~n the empire; while yet, at the mo-
ment of which we now treat, there
was not w~ithin its bounds, one more
thoroughly wretched. We are fecduced,

and

SER M. and deceived by that fa~lse glare which

Sprof~perity sometimes throws around bad
men. We are tempted to imitate their
crimes, in order to partake of their ima-
gined felicity. But remember Haman,
and beware of the -inare. Think not,
when you behold a pageant of grandeur
dis~played to public view, that you dif~-
cern the ensign of certain happiness. In
order to form adny juff cont-lution, you
must follow the great man into the re-
tired apartment, where he lays aside his
disg~uise. YJIou must not only be able to
penetrate into the interior of families,
but: you muff have a faculty by which
you can look into the inside of hearts.
Were you endowed with s~uch a power,
you would most commonly behold good
men, in proportion to their goodness,
s~atisfied and easy; you would behold
atrocious sinners, always refiler~s and
u nhfappy .

Unjust are our complaints, of the pro-

mifcuous diff-ribution made by Provi-
:dence, of its favours among men. From

s~uperficial

superficial views such complaints arise. SE flM.
The diffribution of the goods of fortune, 1
indeed, may often be promiicuous; that
is, difproportioned to the moral charac-
ters of men; but the allotment of real
happines~s is never so. For to thJe icked
there is no peace. Th~y are like the troubled
sea wh~en it cannot r~ef . They travJel w~ith
pain all their day s. Iroubkl nd n g uyJ
prevail againfl them. Terrors make them
afraid on every jde. A dreadful found its
i~n th~eir ears , and rthey are in great fear
whrere no fear is.~-H`ith~erto we have
considered HJaman under the chara £er of
a very wicked man, tormented by crimi-
nal pafirons. Let us now confider him,
merely ars a child of fortune, a prof~pe-
rous man of the world ; and proceed to
observe,

II. How unavailing worldly prosperity

is, since, in the midst of it, a- single dif-
appointment is fufficient to embitter all
its pleasures. We might at first imagine,
that the natural. ef~fe~cti of prosp~erity would

be,

SE Af.M be, to diffufe over the mind a prevailing

fa t~isfadnion, which the lesser evils of life
could not ruffle or diflurb. We might
expedf, that as one in the full glow of
health, depiifes the inclemency of wea-
ther; so one in poffeffion of all the ad-
vantages of high power and flation,
thould disregard flight injuries; and, at
perfedt ease with himself, thould view,
in the moss favourable light, the behavi-
our of others around him. Such effee-~s
would indeed follow, if worldly prosperity
contained in its~elf the true principles of
hluman felicity. But: as it poffeffes them
not, the very reverse of those conf~iequen-
ces generally obtains. Prosperity debili-
tates, inflead of firengthening the mind.
Its moss common effecr is, to create an
extreme sensibility to the slightest wound.
It foments impatient desires 3- and raires
expeda~~tions which1 no filcef~s can sa~tisfy~.
it fat~crs as false delicacy, which fickens
in the midst of indulgence. By repeat-
ted gratification, it blunts the feelings of
mern to, wh'iat is plealmng; and leaves- them

unhappily

unhappily acute to whatever is uneafyr. SER M.

VII.

Hence, the gale which another would 3r~
fe~arcely feel, is, to the prosperous, a rude
tempest. H~ence, the rofe-leaf doubled
b~elow~ them on the couch,· as is told of the
effeminate Sybarite, breaks their reft.
Hence, the difr~efped ihown by Mordecai,
preyed with such violence on the heart of
Haman. Upon no principle of reason can
we assign a fufficient caus~e for all the dif-
tress w~hich this incident: occasioned to
him. The caule lay not in the external
incident. It lay within hims~elf a it arole
from a mind diftempered by prosperity.

L~et this example corredt that blind

eagerness, wijth which we rush to the
chace of worldly greatnes~s and honours.
I fay not, ·that it thould altogether divert
us from purfulng them; since, when en-
joyed with temperance and wisdom, thiey
n ay doubtless both enlarge our utility,
and contribute to our comfort. But let it
teach us not to over-rate them. Let; it
convince us, that unless we add to them
the necessary corre~tives of piety and vir-

to e,

SER M. tue, fbey are, by themselves, more likely

VI'.to render us wretched, than to make us

h~appy.

L~et the memorable fate of Haman

suggest to us also, how often, besides cor-
rupting the mind, and engendering inter-
nal misery, they lead us among precipices,
and betray us into ruin. At the moment
when fortune s~eemed to iimile upon him
w~ijth the most serene and fettled afped,
the wvas digging in secret the pit for his
fall. Prosperity was weaving around his
head the webs of defiru~tion. Success in-
flamed his pride ; pride increas~ed his thirfl
of revenge a the revenge which, for the
fakte of one mart, he fought to execute on
a wvhole~nation, incensed the Queen ; and
be is doomed to f~uffer the fagme death
which he had prepared for Mordecai.--
H-]ad HE-aman remained in a private flati-
on, he might have arrived at a peaceable
old age. He might have been, I thall not
f~ay, a good or a happy man, yet pro-
bably far less guiltyr, and less wretched,
thaln wchen placed at the head of the

greateiR

greatest empire in the East. Who knowreeth S8 I
·iwhat is good fo~r man in this by'e, allthe N
days o' h5is vain itfe, which he Jfendeth as
a/haldow ?

An extensive contemplation of human

affairs will lead us to this coniclufion,
That among the different conditions and
ranks of men, the balance of happines~s
is preserved in a great meas~ure equal;
and that the high and th~e low, the rich
and the poor, approach, in point of real
-enjoyment, much nearer to each other,
-than is commonly imagined. In the lot
of man, mutual compens~ations, both of`
pleas~ure and of pain, universally take
place. Providence never intended, .that
any slate here thould be either completely
happy, or entirely miserable. If the feel-
ings of pleasu~re are more numerous, and
mnore li~vely, in the higher departments
of life, suc6h also are those of pain. If
greatnes~s flatters our vanity, it multiplies
our dangers. If opulence increase~s our
gratifications, it i~ncreafCes, in the fame
proportion, our desires and demands. If

the:

SE R M. the poor are.confined to a more narrow cir-

VZII ~~cle, yet within that circle lie mofl of those

natural f~atisfa~tions,which,af'ter all the re-
finements of art, are found to be the most
genuine and true. In a slate, therefore,
wjshere there is neithmer so much to be co-
veted on the one hand, nor to be dreaded
on the other, as at first appears, how su~b-
miflive ought we to be to the disposal of
Providence ! How temperate in our de-
fires and purs~uits ! How much more at-
tentive to preserve our virtue, and to im-
prove our minds, than to gain the doubt-
·ful and equivocal ad van tages of worldly
pros~perity !-But now, laying aside the
consideration of Haman's great crimes a
laying aside his high prosperity; viewing
him simply as a man, let us oblerve, from
hris hiflory,

III. H-ow weak human nature is, which,

in the absence of real, is thus prone to
create to itself imaginary woes. AR~ this
alvaileth w~e nothing·, so long as IJee Flo~r-

W~ould th~e banquet have been on that
account the les~s magnificent, thy palace
leGs splendid, or thy retinue less nume-
rous ? Could the difr~efped of an obscure
firanger dishonour the favourite of a rnigh-
ty King ? In the midst of a thous~and
~u bmifirve cou rtiers, was one s~ullen coun-
tenance an objeat worthy of drawing
thy notice, or of troubling t~hy repose ?-
Alas ! in Ha man we behold too just a
pidture of what often passes within our-
se~lves. W~e never know what it is to be
long at ease. Let the world cease from
chang~ing around. us. Let external things
keep that situation in which we most:
with them to remain a yet somewhat
from within thall soon arif~ie, to dif lurb our
happines~s. A Mordecai appears, or s~eems
to appear, ftting at the gate. Some
vexation, which our fancy has either
entirely created, or at least has unreason-
ably aggravated, corrodes us in s~ecret,

a nd

S E RlvI. and until that be removed, all that we en-

jo valt u otig T hus, while we
are incessantly, complaiining of the vani-
ty and the evils of human life, we make
that vanity, and we increase those evils.
U~nfkrilled in the art of extrading happi-
ness from the obje £s around us, our inge-
nuity solely appears in converting them
into misery.

Let it not be thought, that troubles of

this krind are incident only to the great
and the mighty. Though they, perhaps,
from the intemperance of their pafflons,
are peculiarly ex-posed to them; yet the
diseas~e its~elf belongs to human nature,
and spreads through all ranks. In the
humble and s~eemingly quiet thade of
private life, discontent broods over its
imaginary fbrrows; preys upon the citi-
zen, no les~s than upon the courtier; and
o~ften nouriihes pafirons, equally malig-
nant in the cottage and in the palace.
Having once seized the mind, it ipreads
,,s own gloom over every fulrrounding
sbieAt; it every where searches out ma-

tenials

rerials for itf'elf ; and in no direation more EVR .M.
tFrequentlry employs its unhappy adivi- --·
ty, than in creating divifious amongst
mankind, and in magnifying flight pro-
voecations into mortal injuries. Thos~e
felf-created miseries, imaginary in the
caus~e, but real in the fuffering, will be
found to form a proportion of human
evils, not inferior, either in s~everity or
in number, to all that we endure from
the unavoidable calamities of life. In
situations where much comfort might be
enjoyed, this man's fuperiorityr, and that:
man's negled, our jealousy of a friend,
our hatred of a rival, an imagined as-
front, or a mifiaken point of honour,
allow us nzorepoife. Hence, discords in
families, an~imofities among friends, and
wars among nations. H-ence, Haman
mis~erable in the midst of all that great-
nefis could beffow. Hence, multitudes
in the most obs~cure flations, for whom
Providence seemed to have prepared a
quiet life, no les~s eager in their .petty
broils, nor less tormented by their pas-

V 7o L. I~. O f ions

8 ER M. fions than if Iprincely ~honours. were the

~cwprize for whilih they co-nteted..

FaoMv this train of obfearvatlon, .which

the Text has fiuggefied, can we avoid re-
flefting upon the disorder in which hu-
man nature plainly appears at~pref~ent to
lie. ? We have beheld, in Haman, the
pidiure of that misery which arises from
evil pa Hions; of that unhappinefsr, which.
is incident to the higefbet pros~perity; of
that dis~content, which is common to
every fla te. Whether we confider him
as a bad man, a prosperous man, or fim-
ply as a mnan, in, every light we behold
reason too weak; for pafflon. This is the
fiource: of the reigning evil a this is the
root of the.univerfal ~dis~ease. The flory
of Hamnan only: fhows~us, what human
nature has too. g enerally~ appeared to be
in every age. Hence, when' we read
the hiflory of na~tions, wha~t do we read
but the hjifory of the follies and crimes
of men ? We~ maay dignify thofCe recorded
t~rahixgfaions, by calling them the intrigues

of

o ite
kmen,-i- and the exploits' of conqluer- s E IN.
ors. but~ they are, in truth, no other than .~-
the es forts of dis~content to efeape from its
misery, and the struggles of contending
pafflons among unhapzpy men. The hifto-
ry of mankind has been as continued. tra-
gedy; the world, a. great theatre exhibit-.
ing; the fame repeated famee, of the follies
of men thooting forth ~into guilt, and of
their passions fermenting, by a quick pro-
cess, into mise~ry.

But can we believe, that the nature of
man came forth in this slate from the hands
of its gracious Creator ? Did he frame
this wvorld, and flore it . with inhabi-
tants, solely that it might be repleniihed
with crimes and misfort~unesl -In the
moral, as well as in the natural worl~d,
we may plainly discern the ifigns of some
violent convulflon, which has thattered
the original workmanship of the Almighty.

gloom of human vanity and guilt, are
like the s~cattered columns, the broken
arches, and defaced foulptures of some
fallen temple, whos~e ancient s~plendor
appears amidst its ruins. So conspicuous
in human nature are those charadters,
both of a high origin, and of a degrad-
ed slate, that, by many religious ~e~ts
throughout the earth, they have been
seen and confeffed. A tradition se~ems to
have pervaded almost all nations, that
the human race had either through some
offence forfeited, or through fomne mif-
fortune loft, that flation of primaeval
honour which they once poffeffed. But
while from this domtine, ill underftocid,
and involved in many fabulous tales, the
nations wandering in Pagan darknels
could draw no consequences that w'ere
juff a while totally ignorant of the na-
ture of the dis~eas~e, they foug2ht in vain
for the remedy a the fame divine revela-

also, how we may be reffored to virtue
and to happiness.

the afEitance which this revelation affords,
for the refforation of our nature, and the
recovery of our felicity. With humble

medicinal springs which it hath opened,
for curing the dis~orders of our heart and

rence, look up to that Divine Personage,
who d~eficended into this world, on pur-
pose to be the Eghti and the ife~ of men;
who came, in the fulness· of g~race and
truth, to r epair the defolaztions of many
generations, to reitore order amonig the
works of God, and to raise up a newre earth,
and newze beavuens, wherein righteogr~efs
jhoulld dwell for ever-. Und er his tuition
let us put ourselves; and, amidst the
florms of pamron to which we are here
exposed, and the slippery paths which we-c

agrE

ful that a Heav~cenly Condudor voirchiaf~es
his aid, let tis earnestly pray,' thia'tfr~om
him may deficend divine light~ to guide
our fleps, and divine fIrength to fortify
our minds. Let us pray, ththat h grace
may keep us fbrord all intemfperate paffi-
ons, ·and miftak'en purs~uits of pleaffare;
that whether it th~all be~ his w~ill to ieo
to deny us earthly profpdrity, he may'blets
as w~ith, a dalmn, a fdiiund, and well-regu-
lated minid; maya give us imoderation in
fiuc-efs, arid fortitude undler a disap~point-
nient s antd may exiable :us' so ~to take
wYarning from 'the crimes and~ miseries of
others, as to eicape the inares of guilt.

WYHILE we thus maintain a due de-

pendence on -God, let us als~o exert our-
~selves with car2 in aliting oxir ovin part.

even though it be effeemed innocent,
to acquire an absolute ascendant, your
inward peace will be impaired. But if
any, which has the taint of guilt, take
early poffef~ion of your mind, you may
date from that moment the ruin of your
tranquillity. Nor with the season of
youth does the peril end. To the irn-
petuofity of youthful desire, succeed
the nire sober, but no less dangerous,
attachments of advancing years ; when
the paflions which are connedted~ with
interest and a~mbition begin their reign,
and too frequently extend their malig-
nant influence, even over thos~e periods
of life which ought to be most tranquil.
From the first to the last of man's abode

You are not to imagine, that the warn-

ings which I have given in this dif~couarfe,
are applicable only to the qfie of furch
signal offenders as he was, of whom the
Text treats. Think not, as I am afraid
too many do, that because your pafflons
have not hurried you into atrocious deeds,
they have therefore wrought no mischief,
and have left no fling behind them. By a
continued series of loose, though appa-
rently trivial, gratifica~tions, the heart is
often as thoroughly corrupted, as by the
comm~if~on of any one of those enormous
crimes which Spring from great ambition,
or great revenge. Habit gives the paiions
thength, wvhile the absence of gletring
guilt seemingly juffifies them; and, un-
aw~akened by rernorfe, thle finner proceeds

we are imperceptibly betrayed; and from
ane licentious attachment, on~e criminal

refped, limrilar in their ·procers; and,
though by different roads, conduat at laif

beheld Bathsheba, did not plan the death
of Uriah. Hamadn was nlot delivered up
all at once to the madnes~s of revenige. His

SER M. THE measure according to which

.V".,knowledge is dis~pensed to man, as-

fords cons~picuous proofs of divine wis-
dom. In many inflances we clearly per-
ceive, that either more or less would have
proved dietrimental to his slate ; that en-
tire ignorance would have deprived him
of proper motives to adtion; and that
complete discovery would have raised
him to a sphere too high for his pre-

f'ent

sent powiers. He is therefore permitted SVER I ~.
to knotoe only in part ; and to fee through ~
a glass, darkly. He is left in, that slate
of conjeaure, and partial information,
which, though it may occasionally fuzb-
jeat him to diffrefs, yet, on the whole,
conduces most to his improvement s which
affords him knowledge f~ufficient for the
purpores of virtue and of adtive life, with-
out diflurbing the operations of his mind,
by a light too bhright and dazzling. This
evidently holds, with refpeAt to that de-
gree of obs~curity, which now covers the
great laws of Nature, the decrees of the
Supreme Being, the slate of the invisible
world, the future events of our owtn life,
and the thoughts and designs which pai's
within the breasts of others *.

But there is an ignorance of another

kind, with refped to which the applica-
tion of this remark anay appear more du-
bious; the ignorance under which men
labour concerning their happiness in the
present life, and the means of attaining it.

fpicuousr

SER M. i[picuous. ·But it is not to high flatious

VI that the dearine of the Text is limited.

In the crimes by which too often thes~e are
gained, and in the misfortunes which they
afterwards bring forth, the greater part of
every audience may think themselves lit-~
tie concerned. Leaving such themes,
therefore, to the poet and the hifforian,
let us come nearer to ourselves, and
thrvey the ordinary walk of life.

Around us, we every where behold a

busy multitude. R~estless and uneasy in
their present; situation, they are inceffent-
ly employed in accomplishing a change of
it s and, as soon as their with is fulfill-
ed, we discern by their behaviour, that
they are as diffatisfied as they were be-
fore. Where they expedted to have found
a paradise, they find a desert. The man
of business pines for leisu~re. The leis~ure
for which he had longed, proves an irk-
fa~me gloom; and, through want of em-
ployment, he languishes, fickens, and dies.
TPhe man of retirement fancies no slate to
be to happy as that of ad~ive life. But

hte has not engaged long in the tumults SiI·
and contests of the world, until he finds cr
cause to, look back with regret on the calm
hours of his former privacy and retreat.
Beauty, wit, eloquence and fame, are
eagerly desired by persons in every rank
of life. They are the parent's fondest
w~ih for his child.; the ambition of the
young, and the admiration of the old.
And yet, in what numberless~ inflances
have they proved, to those who poffeffed
them, no other than thining snares ; f~e-
duaions to vice, infligations to folly, and
in the end, sources of mifiery?~ Com-
fortably m~ight their days have passed,
had they been lef's conspicuous. But the
diftinations which brought them forth to
notice, conferred splendor, and with-
drew happiness. Long life is, of all
others, the most general, and s~eemingly
the most ·innocent o~bje~t of desire. With
refped to this too, we so frequently· err,
that it would have been a blefirng to
many to have had their with denied.
There was a period wohen they might

VO L. L. P have

s.Er ER - have quitted the flage with honour, andi

~ ,- ~in peace. Buit by living too long, they

outlived their reputation a outlived their
family, their friends and comforts; and
reaped saltring; fromn the ·continuance of
days, ~eept to feel the prethr-e of age, to
taste the drpegs of life, and to behold a
wrider comnpafs of human mnifery.

Man wualketh in a~ ·uaa~in }bow. H is fears

are often as vain as his withes, As what
flattered him in.expeaation·, frequzentlyr
wounds him in poffefio~n; ib fohe event
to which he looked fo~rwcard with ant
tnx~ious and fearful eye, has often, when
it arriv-ed, laid its terrors aside; Ra na has
brought~ in its· train unexpe~ted bleffc-
ings. Both good and evil are beheld at
a dtifkance, through. a perfpeative which
deceives. The colou~rs of objeas when
nigh~, are entirely· different. from what
they appea-red, when theyi were viewed
in fu-tu~rity.

THE fadt then being undoubtedly cer-

tain, that it is common for men to be

·deceivted

deceived in their profpefts of happines~s, S8 E-I~
let us next enquire into the carufes of that I
deception. Let us attend to thos~e pecu-
liar circumitances in our slate which ren-
der us such incompetent judges of future
good or evil in this life.

Firit, We are not fufficiently acquaint-

ed with ourselves, to foresee our future
feelings. We judge by the fenifations of
the prefeat moment: and, in the fervour
of desire, pronounce confidently concern-
ing the desired objeft. But we refleft
not, that our minds, like our bodies, un-
dergo great alteration from the situations
into which they are thrown, and the pro-
greffive flages of life through which they
pass. Hence, concerning any condition
which is yet untried, we conjeature with
much uncertainty. In imnagination, we
carry our prefeat wants, inclinations, and
fientiments, into the slate of life to which
we aspire. But no sooner have we enter-
edl on it, than our fentimnents and incl'in-
ations change. New wants and desires
arise -, new obje~ts are required to gratify

P 2them,

s 5MIf. them; and by cons~equence our old diffa-

- tisf3aion returns, and the void which was

to have been filled, remains as great as it
was before.

But next, supposing our knowledge of

ourselves f~ufficient to dired us in the
choice of happiners, yet itill we are liable
to err, from our ignorance of the con-
ne~tions which fusbfift between our own
condition and ~that of others. No indivi-
dual can be happy, unless the circum-
stances of thofk around him be to adjuff-
ed as to cons~pire with his interest. For,
in human faciety, no happiness or miite-
ry flands unconne~ed and independent.
Our fiortunes are interwoven by threads
innu mera ble. W~e touch one another on
allI sides. O dne man's misfortune or fuc-
cer~s, his wisdom or his folly, often, by
its cons~equ~ences, reaches through multi-
tudes. Such a iiyfiem is far too compli-
cated for our arrangement. It requires
adjunfments beyond our skill and power.
I!t is a chaos of events, ihnto which our
eye cann'ot pierce; and is capable of re-

gulation,

gulation, only by him who perceives at one S8 E -~
glance the relation of each to all. i-v

Far~ther, As we are ignorant of the

events which will arifCe from the combi-
nation of our circumflances with those of
others, so we are equally ignorant of the
influence which the present tranf'adions of
our life may have upon thos~e which are
future. The important qiueftion is not,
What is good for a man one day ; but
what is good. for him all the days of his
hfe ? Not, wNhat will yield him a few
s~cattered pleasures ; but what will render
his life happy on the whole amount ?
And is he a~ble to answer that question,
who knoweth not what one day maay burin
forth a who cannot tell, whether the
events of it may not branch out into con-
sequences, which will afthme a direaion
quite opposite to that in which they s~et
forth, and [pread themsel~ves .over all his
life: to come ? There is not any prefeat
rmoment that is unconneated witeh Come
future. one. The life of every mnan is a
continued chain of incidents, each link

Straniition from icaule to effeft, from event

to event, is oftenl carried on by secret
fle~ps, w~rhich our foresig~ht ·cann~ot divine,
annd our fgaicityt is ulnable to trace. Evil
may at fomzae fitiure ~per~iod, bring forth
good; and goo~d mayi bring forth evil,
both equadlly olnexpe~fted. H~ad the Pa-
triarch, Jof~ph, conti~nued to loiter under
his father's fond indurlgenc~e, he mnight
have lived an obfcuire an~d infignifiicant
li-fe. From thie pit and the prison, arol~e
the incidents wnhich m~ade him the~ rulet
of Egypt, and the liviour of his father's
bo de.

Laffly, supposing evrery other incapa-

city to b~e removed, ;our ignorance of the
dangers to which our spiri-tual sla~te is
exposed, would disqualify as for judging
soundly concerning our true happiness.
Higher interests, than thaife ofsl the prefrent
world are now depending. AH1 that is
done or fuffered by ats here~, zlltimately
refers to that immo16rtal wrrorld, for whr-ich
goQod men are trained up, under- the care

of an Almighty Parent. We are as in- *~fjIW
competent judges of the rneafures necef'c---
fary to be pursued for this end, as children
are, of the proper conduA to be held in
their education. W~e foerefeethe dangers
of our spiritual, flill less than we do those
of our nat-ural state; becadCe wue a~re: less
attentive ito trace them. WeIV are (till more
exposed to vice than to~ mirery ; becaus~e
the confidence whiich we place in our vir-
tue, is yet worse founded than thact whi-ch
we place in our wisdom. Can you efleem
him prosperous, who is raised to a fitua-
tion which falatters his pafflons, but which
corrupts his principles, disorders his tem-
per, and, finally overfets his virtue ? In
the ardor of perfuit, how little are the~e
effeats forefieen ? And ye~t, how~often are
they accomplish~ed, by a change of condi-
tion ?Latent corruptions are called forth ;
feeds of guilt are quickened into life: a
growth of crimes arises, which, had it not
been for the, fatal culture of prosperity,
would never have s~een the light. How
oft~en is man, boafiful as he is of r·ealfon,

merely

8 EIR M. merely the creature of his fortune s form,

Sed, and mouldered by the incidents of his

life !-Hazael, when yet a private man,
detefied the thoughts of, cruelty. Thou

dr~en, and rio up the wreomen wreith child. - Is
t5y jervant a dog, replied Hazael, that be
fhoulld do these thingas? But no ,foo>ner was
he cloathed with the coveted purple, than
it seemed to taint his nature. He com-
mitted the crimes of which, at a difiance,
he believed himself incapable; and became
the bloody tyrant, whole chara~ter his
foul once abhorred .

Secu then at prefeat is man; thus

incapable of pronouncing with certainty
concerning -his own good or evil. Of
futurity he discerns little i and even that
little he fees throufgh a cloud. ~Ignorant
of the alteration which his s~entiments and
desires will undergo from new fituati-
ons in life; ignorant of the conf~equen-

onof his circumfitances with tholfe of others ~~
around him a ignorant of thie influence
which the prdfent may have on the future
events of his· life; ignorant of the effeAt-
which a change of condition may produce,
on his moral charader, and his eternal in-
terefts; how can he know wzehat is good
jfor hrim al the daoys of his vanr~lIf g -re, ich
h~e pendeth as a jhadowre ?

Instead of only lamenting this ignorance,
let us, in the last place, confider how it
ought~ to be improved; what duties it
fuggef is,and what wife ends it was intend-
ed by Providence to promote.

I. L;ET this doL~rine teach us to pro-

ceed with caution and circumfpeaion,
through a world where evil so frequently
lurks under the form of good.. To be
hum~ble and modest in opinion, to be vigi-
lant and attentive in conduar, to diffruff
fair appearances, and to reffrain rath de-
fires, are infirud~ious which the darkness
of our prefeat: state thould firongly in-

culcate.

8 ER M.~ culcate. God hath appointed our situ-

Lcq~Jation to be to ambiguous, in order both

t~o call forth the exertion of those intelli..
gent powers which he hath given us, and
to enforce our dependlence on his graciouls
aid. It is not in man that wparlketb, to dzire
bis feps. Surrounded with so many be-
wildering paths, among which the wisest
are ready to firay, how earnestly thould
we implore, and how thankfully thould
we recei ve, that divine illumination which
is promis~ed in fecripture to the pious and
the humble ! l'he fe~rrt of the Lord tis with5
them that fear him. He willt guridse ~th
w~ith his counsel. He wpill rteach them the
wa~ry that they should chuf~e. But~ what
mraft be the fate of him, who, amidst
all the dangers attending human conduft,
neither looks rap to Heaven for direftion,
nor properly exerts that reason which
God hath given him ? If to the most
d~ifigent enquirer, it proves so difficult a
ta&i to difling~uifh true good, from those
filal;cious appearances with which it is
ac-r bHended, how thould he diilcover it,

to the search; who applies to no other z
counsellor than present pleafure,and, with
a ranth and credulous mnind, d~elivers him-
self up to every ~ug~geftion of desire ?

This adm'onition I par~ticularly di~re~t to

there, who are in a period of life: too
often charafterized by forward pref~ump-
tion and headlong pursuit-. The self-
conceit of the younpg, is the great s~ource
of thofie ·dangers to which they are ·ex-
posed; and it is peculiarly unfortulnate,
that the age which flands rnoft in need of
the cou~nsel of the wtife, thould be the
most prone to contemn it. Confident in
the opinions which they adopt, and in
the meas~ures which they purfibe, they
seem as if they underflood Solomon to
fay, not, WYho knowethS, but, Who is igno-
rant of wheat is good for mna all th3e days
of hi. i~fe I The blif's to be aimed at, is,
in their opinion, fully apparent. It is
not the danger of mistake, but the failure
of s~uccess, whtich they dread. A~tivity
to seize, not iagacity to discern, is the

only

SE R M only requilite which they value.-H--ow

~Lt~ long thall it be, ere the fate of your pre-

deceffors in the fame coulrfbe, teach you
wvifdom ? How long thall the experience
of all ages, continue to lift its voice to
you in vain ? Beholding the ocean on
which you are embarked, covered with
wrecks, are not thofei fatal signals fu~ffi-
clent to admonifhr you of the hi'dden
rock ? If, in paradise itf~elfs there was a
tree which bare fruit fair to the eye, but
mortal in its effe~t~s, how much more, in
this fallen slate, may such deceiving ap-
pearances be exlieAted to abound ! The
whole iRate of Nature is nowv become a
scene of delusion to the fed~ual mind.
Hardly any thing is what it appears to
be: and what flatters most, is always
farthest from reality. There are voices
which sing around you ; but: whos~e firains
allure to ruin. There is a banquet spread,
whelre poison is in every djih. There Is
a1 couch which invites you to repoi-e; but
to slumber· upon it, is death. In s~uch a
situation, be not h3ligh-mrinded, but fear. Let

sobriety

fobnrety temper your unwary ardour. Let II:"
modesty check your rash presumption. cv
Let wis~dom be the offspring of refledion
now, rather than the fruit of bitter ex-
perience hereafter.

II. LE T OUT ignOr3DCe of What is good

or evil, corred anxiety about worldly fCuc-
cers. As rafhnefrs is the vice of youth, the
opposite extreme of immoderate care is the
vice of advancing years. The doarine
w~hich I have illuffrated, is equally adapt-
ed for checking bo~th. Since we are foof-
ten betrayed into evil, by tlhe millaken
pursuit of good, care and attention are
requisite, both in forming our choice, and
in conduating our pursuit; but since our
attention and care are liable to be so oft~en
fruffrated, they thould never be allowed
to depri~ve us of tranquillity.

The ignorance in which we are left con-

cerning good and evil, is not such as to
s~upersede prudence in conduA: Fior wis~-
dom is flill found to excel folly asfar as
li~ght excelleth darkness. But: it is that de-

you can do nothing to advance your f~uc- ~~
cess, and you do much to ruin your
peace. YCou plant within your breast the
thorn which is long to~ gall you. To the
vanity of life, you add a vexation of
frpirit, which is wholly of your own cre-
ation, not of Divine~ appointment. For
the dubious goods of this world were
never designed by God to rais~e f'uch eager
attachment. They were given to man for
his occasional refreshment, not for his
chief felicity. By s~etting an excefirve va-
lue upon objeats, which were intended
only for your fecondaryregarrd, you change
their nature. Seeking more fatisf~a£1ion
from them than they are able to afford,
you receive~ less than they might give.
From a millaken care to fecture y~our
happiness, you bring upon yourselves
certain m~isery.

III. LE T OUT igDortDCe Of good and

evil, determine us to follow Providence,
~nd to resign ourfrel~ves to God. One of

tthe

SER hs. the most important lessons which can be
VI '' given to man, is resignation to his Maker;

and nothing inculcates it more, than the
experience .of his own inability to guide
hims~elf. You know not what is good for
you, in the future periods of life. But
God perse £ly knows it; and if you faith-
fully s~er ve him, you have reason to be-
lieve that he will always cons~ult it. Be-
fore him lies the whole fiuceffion of events,
which are to fill up your existence. It is
in his power to arrange and model them.
at his pleasure; and to to adapt one thing,
to another, as to fulfil his promnife of mak-
ing them all work together for good to thoJi
weho love himn. Here then, a~midst the agita-
tions of desire, and the perplexities of
doubt, is one fixed point of reif. By this
let us abide, and difmnifs our anxiety about
things uncertain and unknown. Acquaint
yourpilvres wieith God, andbe at peace. Secure
thle one th3ingn needjult. Study to acquire an
interest in the Divine favour·: . and you
may safely surrender yourselves to the
Divine adminiffration.

When

When tempted to repine at your con- 8vrI

dition, refle~t how uncertain it is, whether v
you thould have been happier in any
other. Remembering the vanity of mainy
of your former withes, and the fallacy
which you have to often experienced in
your s~chemes of happines~s, be thankful~
that you are placed under a wiser direc-
tion than your own. Be not too parti-
cular in your petitions to~ Heaven, con-
cerning your temporal interests. Suffer
God to govern the world according to
his own plan; and only pray, that he
would beffow what his unerring wifdorn
fees to be best for you on the whole. In
a word, Commit your wreay unto the Lord.
'Truy in him and do good. Follow where-
ever his Providence lea'ds; comply with
whatever his will requires; and leave all
the re't: to him.

have ;some apology to offer for dev~iating,

trine wh~ich I have illuffrated, deprives
him of all excure, and places his folly in
the most ·firiking light. He climbs the
sleep rock,qand treads on the edge of a
precipice, in order to catch a thadow.
He has cause to dread, not only the un-
certainty of the event which he withes to
accomplith, ·but the nature also of that
event when accomplithed. He is not only
liable to that disappointment of ~u~ccef~s,
wh-ich so often fruffrates -all the deiigns of
men; but- liable to a disappointment still
more cruel, thlat of being fuccefsful and
miserable at once. Riches and pleafurres
are the chief temptations to criminal
deeds, ye~t those riches, wyhen obtained,
may very .pofT~bly overwhelm him with
unforeseen miseries. Those pleasures may·
cut short his health and life. And is it

so r

f~or such doubtful and fallacious rewards, 's -
that the deceiver fills his mouth with lies, pz
the friend betrays his benefaator, the apof~-
tate renounces his faith, and the affaffn
covers himfCelf with blood ?

Whoever co~mmits a crime, incurs a

certain evil, for a most uncertain good.
What: will turn to his advantage in the
course of this life he cannot w~ith any as-
finuance know. But: this he rnay know,
with full certainty, that by breaking the
Divine commandments he will draw up-
on his head that dif~pleafirre of the Al-
mighty which thall crush him for ever.
The advantages of this world, even when
innocently gained, are uncertain blef-
sings ; when obtained by criminal means,
they carry a curse in their bosom. To
the virtuous, they are often no more than
chaff. To the guilty, they are always
poison.

V. LE T our imperfe~t knowledge of

what is good or evil, attach us the more
to thof'e few things, concerning which

truy god Of temporal things which
belong to this class, the catalogue, it muff
be confeffed, is small. Perhaps the chief
worldly good we thould with to enjoy Is
a found mind in a found body. Health
and peace, a moderate fortun~e, and a few
friends, fuum up all the undoubted articles
of temporal felicity. Wife wasthe man
who addressed this prayer to God; Re-
mtozve jfrrm me vanity and lies. Giue me
netiher poverty nor richer. Feed me with

I be poor an~d feal, andr take the name of my
God in *vain.* He whose- wishes, ref'peit-

most reasonable and bounded, is likely
to lead the f~afeft, and for that reason,
the most desirable life. By afpgiring too

to poffr~is.

But with regard to spiritual felicity, we

are not confined to such humble views.
Clear and determinate objea-s are pro-
posed to our pursuit j and full s~cope is
given to the most ardent desire. The for-
givenefs of our fins, and the afif~tance o~f
God's holy grace to guide our life; the
improvement of our minds, in knowledge
and wisdom, in piety and virtue; the
proteation and favour of the great Father
of all, of the blessed Redeemer of man-
kind, and of the Spirit of fandiiFication
and comfort 4 there are objeats in the
purfulit -of which there is no room for
hesitation and diffruff, nor any ground for
the queflion in my Text, Whro knowreeth
what is good for mazrn? Had Providence
spread an equal obs~curity over happiness
of every kind, we might have had some
reason to complain of the vanity of our
condition. But we are not left to so
hard a fate. Tfhe Son of God hath de·-
fcended from heaven, to be the Lightt of'

the·

wandering mortals, and hath taught them
the way which leads to life. Worldly en-
jo ments are thewn to be bollow and de-
ceitful, with an expres~s intention to dire61
their affetions towards those which are:
s~piritual. The fame disc~overies which
d~iininith- the value of the one, serve to in-
creas~e that of the other. Finally,

VIT. L/Er our ignorance of wvhat is good

or evil here below, leaid our thoughts and
desires to a better world. I.ha ve endea-
voured to vindicate the wisdom of Provi-
dence, by thfewing the many useful pur-
poses which this ignorance at present pro-
mostes. It serves to check pres~umption
a)nd rashness, and to enforce a diligent
exertion of our rational powers, joined
with a n hum ble dependence on Divine aid.
It moderates eager paimons rerfeing
worldly fa~ccefs~. It inculcatecs refignati-
on to the disposal of a Providence which
Is much wise=r than m~an. It re~fsrains us

from employing unla~wful means, in order sRI
to compas~s our most favourite designs. I·F

things which are unquestionably good.. It

concerning good and ev~il.

At thie f~ame tirne, the caufels which

render this obscurity neceff~aryr, too plainly
indicate a broken and corrupted slate of
human nature. They thew this life to be
a slate of trial. They f~uggft the ideas of'
a land of pilgrimage, not of ~the house of

aspires to no hi~h~er portion a who could
be satisfied- to spend his whole existence,
in chafing those treacherous- appearances
of good which to often· mock :his pursuit.
W7hat thadow e~an be more vain than the

sER M. RUCH cornmuning with themselves

~--PJthere has always been among mankind;

though frequently, God knows, to no
purpofie, or to a purpose wors~e than
none. Could we discover the employ-
ments of men, in retirement, how often
thould we find their thoughts occupied
wyith fubjedis, w~hich they would be
aihamed to owrn~ ?What a large ihare
Jiave ambition and avarice, at some times
the: grossest passions, and at other times the
meaineft trifles, in their solitary musings ?

They

TIhey carry the world, with all its vices, SE RM.~
into their retreat; and maybe fid to dwell ·-
in the midst of the world, even wrhen they
seem to be arlone.

This s~urely is not that fort: of com-

muning which the PSalmist recommends.
For this is not properly commluning~ wi~th
our heart, but rather holding secret in-
tercourf~e wtith the wiorld. W~hat the
Ps~almist means to recommend, is religi-
ous recolleation; that exercis~e of thought
wfhich is connedted with the precept given
in the preceding words, to Jantd in alret,
and si not. It is to commune with our-
selves under the charadter of ifpiritual
and immortal beings ; and to ponder thofce
paths of our feet, which are leading us to
eternity. I thall in the first place, thow
the advantages offiach serious retirement
and meditation: and thall, in the second
place, point out iome. of the principal
fubjeLas which ought to employ us In our
retreat.

The advantages of rertiring from the

w\orld, to com7-mune wY~iflilth oR hear)t, ill be

found

SE RM. found to be great, whether we regard our

IX. _.happiness in this world, or our prepara-

tion for the world to come.

LE T us confider them, first, with ret

fpel 'to our happine~s~ in this world. It
will readily occur to you, that an entire
retreat from worldly affairs, is not what
religion reqcuires ; nor does it even enjoin
a great retreat from them. Some fations
of life would not permit this; and there
are few stations w~hich render it necessary.
The chief field, both of the duty and of
the improvement of man, lies in aative
life. BEy the graces and virtues which he
exercise~s amidst his fellow-creatures; he
is trained up for heaven. A total retreat
from the world, is so far from being, as
the Roman Catholic Church holds, the
perfeac'ion of religion, that some particu-
lar cafes excepted, it is no other than the
abnfei of it.

B~ut though entire retreat would lay

a;s aside from the part for which Pr·ovi-
dence chiefly intended us, it is certain,

that

that without occasional retreat, we muff sEXR-
aa that part very ill. Ther~e will be Ls
neither consistency in the conduA, nor
dignity in the charader, of one who s~ets
apart no share of his ~time for meditation
and refledtion. In the heat and buffle of
life, while pafflon is every moment throw-
ing false colours on the objeats around us,
nothing can be viewed in a just light. If
you with that Reason thould exert her
native power, you must itep aside: from
the crowd into the cool arid silent thade.
It is there that, with sober and Rteady eye,
the examines what is good or ill, what is
wife or foolith, in human condua; the
looks back on the past, the looks forward
to the future s and forms plans, not for
the present moment only, but for the
whole of life. How thould that man dif-
c~harge any part of his duty aright, who
never f~uffers his passions to cool ? And
hrow thould his paflions cool, who is
engaged without interruption, in the tu-
mult of the world ? This incessant flir
may be called, the perpetual drunken-

nes~s

SE RM. ness of life. It raiies that eager fermen.

Ix,
·c~J tation of spirit, which will be ever fend.

ing forth the dangerous fumes of rathuels
and folly. Whereas he who mingles relil
gious retreat with worldly affairs, remains
calm and mast~er of himse~lf. He is not
whirled round, and rendered giddy, by
the agitation of the world, but, from that
sacred retirement in which he has been
conve~rsant among higher objeQs, comes
forth into the world with manly tranquil-
lity, fortified by principles which he has
formed, and prepared for whatever may
befall.

As he who is unacquainted with re-

treat, cannot sustain any charad~er with
propriety, so neither can he: enjoy the
wrorld with any advantage. Of the tw~o
classes of men who. are most apt to be ne-
gltigentr of this duty5, the mnen of pleas~ure,
and the men of busines~s, it is hard to fay
wErhichz fu~fer moit, in point of enjoy-
ment from that negled2. To the former
every moment ~appears to be loft, wlhich!
tj:,artakes not of the vivacity of amnu-reent.

To conned one plan of gaiet~y with anoi s fREM.'X
ther, is their whole fludy;: till, in a very ·-r
thort time, nothing remains but to tread
the fame beaten;-round: to enjoy what
they have alrteady enjoyed, and to fee
what they have often seen. Pleafurles
thus drawn to the dregs, become vapid
and tasteless. W~hat might have plea~sed
long, if enjoyed with temperance, and
mi~ngled with retirement, being devoured
with foch eager haste, speedily surfeits
and difguits. Hence, the~e are the per-
sons, who after having run ·throughi a
rapid course of pleas~ure, after having
glittered for a few years in the foremofa
line of public amu~sements, are the· mo~ss
apt to fly at last to a melancholy retreat a
not led by religion or reafobn, but driven
by difatppointed hopes, and exhauffed
s~pirits, to the pensive conclusion, that:
all is vanity.

If uninterrupted intercourse with the
w~orld wears out the man of pleasur1e, it
no les~s oppress~es the man of business and
ambition. The firongeft sp~irits must at

length

bE R1< length tik under it. Tre happiest temrn

xx. per Inuf be soured by incessant returns

of the opposition, the inconflancy, and
treachery of men. For he who lives al-
ways· in the buffle of the world, lives in
a perpetual warfare. Here an enemy en-
counters; there, a rival- supplants him.
The ingratitude of a frierid flings him
this hour; and the pride of a furperior
wounds him the next. In vain he flies
for relief to trifling amusements. Th~ese
may afford a temporary opiate to care a
but they communicate no firength to the
mind. On the contrary,they leave innmore
soft and defenceless, when mnolefiations
and injuries renew their attack.

Let him wrhowifhes for an e~ffeatual cure

to all the wounds which the world can
inflia, retire from 'intercourfe with men,
to intercours~e with God. WVhen he en-
ters into his closet, and thuts the door,
let him thut out, at the fame time, all
i~ntrulion of worldly care; and dwell
amron7g objeas divine and immortal.---
Those~ fair profpeAs of order and peace,

thall

th~all there open to his view, which~forto $4 E*
the soft perfedt contrast to the conf~ifign gci-
and misery of this earth. The celefiti1
inha~bitants qluarrel not; among them
thlere is neither igrati~tyde, nor envy,
nor tumult. Mjien may harass one ano-
ther; but in the kingdom of God, con-
uord and tranquillity reign for ~ever.
From such objeats, there be~ams upon the
mind of the pious man, a pure and en-
livening light; there is diffufe~d over his
heart a holy calm. His ,agitated spirit
re-affumes its firmneifs, and regains its
peace. The world sinks in its import-
ance; and the load of mortality and
miferry loei-s almost all its weight. The
green pajutres open, and the~r fill aters
flow around him, besides which the Sh5ep-
herd of IjrPael! guides his flock. The d~if-
turbances and ~alarms, so formidable to
those who are engaged in the tumults of
the world, f~ieem to him only like thunder
rolling afar off; ~like the noise of difiant

~CY~Ievidently conducive to our happineG~ in

this life, so,

IN the s~econd place, it is absolutely

necessary in order to prepare us for the
life to come. Hie who lives always in
public, cannot live to his own foul. The
world lieth in ·rickedne/s; and with good
reason the Christian is exhorted,~ not to
be con~formed to it, but transformed by the
re~neweing of his minad. Our conversation
and intercourse with--the world, is, in
several ref~peas, an education for vice.
Fromn our earliest youth, we are accustom-
ed to hear riches and honours extolled as
the chief poffeffions of man; and pro-
posed to us as the principal aim of our
future pursuits. We are trained up, to
look with admiration on the Pflattering
marks of diftinaion which they beffew.
In quest of thos~e fancied blessings, we fee
the multitude around us ea~ger and ser-
vent. Principles of duty we may, per-
haps, hear fomaetimes inculcated; but

we

we f'eldom behold them brought into S~XM-
competition with worldly profit. The cr
soft names, and plausible colours, under
which deceit, f~eduality anld revenge,
are pref~eated to us in common discours~e,
weaken, by degrees, our natural sense of
the diftinaion between good and evil.
We often meet w~ith crimes authorised
by high examples, and rewarded with
the caresses and Smiles of the world. W~e
discover, perhaps, at laif, that those
whom we are taught to reverence, and
to regard: as our patterns of conduat,
aat upon principles no purer than those
of others.-Thus breathing habiitually a
contagious air, how certain is our ruin,
unless we fometimnes retreat from this
pestilential region, and seek for proper
corredives of. the disord~ers which are
contraded there ? Religious retirement:
both abates the disease, and furnishes the
remedy. It lessens the corrupting influ-
ence ~of the world; and it gives oppor-
tunity fbr b~etter principles to exert their
power. He who is accuffomed to turn

~R z afid e,

which their coa;rs~e apprehenflons can re-

mind leaves the wrorld behind it, feels a
call f~or higher pleas~ures, and seeks thlem
in retreat. The man of public ilpirit has
reco~urse to it in order to form plans for
general good; the man of genius, in or-
der to dwell on his favourite themes;
the philofophier, to pursue bis dircloveries ;

SER M. the falint, to improve himself in grace.

[plendor of royalty, often bears witnes~s
both to the pleafulre wh~ich he received,
and to the benefit wihich he reaped, from
devout meditation. I communtied wibth my
owPn beart, and my spirit made d'lig-ent search.
I thouqght on my weays, and rztuned ay feet
unto God's tef~imonies. In th~e mul~titude of
thoughts weithin me, his comforts delig-ht my
Jjul. Our bleffred Saviour himself, though
of all wiho ever lived on earth he needed
least the afif~tance of religious retreat, yet,
by his frequent pra £1ice, has done it fig-
nal honour. Often were the garden, the
mnountain, and the silence of the night,
fought by him, for intercourse owith hea-
·ven. WYhen be bad/ent the muzltitude aweay,
he went utp into a mounltainr, apart, to pray.

pres~erved in any due degree of force,
amnidft the affairs and avocations of the
world ? While the crowd of surrounding
objet~s is ever rushing on the imagina-
tion, and,occupying the s~enses and the
heart, what is not only ablent from view,
but, by its nature, invif~ibe, is apt to
vanith like a thadow. Hence it is given
as the charadter of wicked men, in scrip-

* Job xx-ii-. 3-

~Look

SE RM. Look up to the firmament, and admire

I his glory. L~ook round on the earth, and

observe his presence every where display-
ed. If the gay landfeape or the fruitful
field, present themselves to your eye, be-
hold him smiling upon his works. If the
mountain raf fe its lofty head, or the ex-
panfe of waters roll its tide before you,
contemplate in those great and solemn
obje~ts, his powver and majesty. Nature,
in all its diversities, is a varied manifefia-
tion of the Deity.- If you were to take the
Wings9= of the mor-ning, and dwroell inz the ut-
termzof prart~s of the sea, even there you
would find him. For in him youl livre and
gove. He fills and animates all space. In
the barren wilderners, as in the peopled
region, you can trace his footsteps; and
in the deepest solitude, you may hear a
voice w~hich testifies of him.

Him, indeed, you are never to con-

found with the workmanship of his
hands. Nature, in its moffawful or mos
pleaiing scenes, exhibits no more than
different forms of inanimate matter. But

on thef b dead forms is impressed the glory SE 4M
of a living Spirit. The beauty, or the
greatness, which appears in them, flows
from the· fountain ~of all greatness and
beauty; in him it centers; of his perfec-
tion it refleAs an image; and towards
him thould lead your view.--In converf~-
ing with a fellow-creature on earth, it is
not with his body we converse~, though it
is his body only which we fee. From his
words and aations we conceive his mind;
·with his mind, though invisible, we hold
correspondence, and dired towards this
Spiritual Effence,our affeation and regard.
In like manner, though here we behold
no more of God than what his works dif-
play, yet in those displays, we are capable
of perceiving the Univerfagl Spirit, and of
holding correspondence with this unseen
Being, in veneration, gratitude,-and love.

It is thus that a pious man, in his re-

tired meditations, viewing natural objea~s
with a spiritual eye, communes with his
heart concerning God. He walks among
the various s~cenes of Nature, as wit~hin

the

SERE M the precinAs: of a g~~reat empe, in the

di~scoveries of the Su reme Being in his

I'I. COM;M-UN E With your heart, in the

f~eafobn of retirement, concerning the world.
The world :is -the great deceiver, whose
fallacious ·arts it highbly imports us to de-
te&t. rBut in the midst of i-ts pleas~ures and
perf~uits, the detedion is impofirble. WVe
-tread, as within· an inchanted circle, where
nothing-appears as it truly is. It is only
-in ·retreat thfat the charmI -can be ~brok~en.
·Did men employ that retreat, not in car-
rying on: the delusion wihich the world h-as
:begun,'not in -formin'g plans of imaginary
blif~s,but in f~ubjeding the happines~s whi~ch
-the world affords to a firitt dilcuffion,
~the spell would djifohre; and in the room
·of the unreal profpeas, which had long
-amused -themn, -the n~k~ednef~s of the wordd
would appear.

Prepare yourselves, then to encounter

:the light of truth. Reifove rather to bear

the

8 ER M. the disappointment of some ~flattering

IXhopes,, than to wander for ever in the

paradis~e of fools. While others meditate
in secret on the means of attaining world-
ly success, let it be your employment to
ferutinize that s~uccess itsel-f. Calculate
fairly to wh~at it amounts; and whether
yoCu are not losers on the whole, by your
apparent gamn. Look back, for this pur-
pore on your past life. Trace it from
your earliest you th; and put the question
to yourselves, what have been its hap-
pieft periods r wvere they those of quiet
and innocence, or those of ambition and
intrigue ? Has your real enjoyment uni-
formly kept pace with what the world
calls prosperity ? As you advanced in
wealth or fl-ation, did you proportionably
advance in happiners ?Has success, al-
most in any one inflance, fulfilled your
expediations ? Where you reckoned upon
most enjoyment, have you not often found
least ? Wherever guilt entered int~o your
pleaf'ures, did not its fling long remain,
after the gratification was past ?---Such

questions

questions as there, candidly anfwvered, S XR 1V.
would in a great meas~ure unmask the J
world. They would expo~e the vanity of
its pretenfionsj and convince you, that
there are other springs than thos~e which
the world affords, to which you muff
apply for happines~s.

While you commune with your heart

concerning what the world now is, con-
fider also what it will one day~appear to
be. Anticipate the awful moment of your
bidding it an eternal farewell. Think,
what refleAions ihall most probably aris~e,
when you are quitting the field, and look-
ing back on the fecene of aion. In.what
light will your closing eyes contemplate
thos~e vanities which now thine to bright,
and thaofe interests which now fivell into
s~uch high importance ? What part will
you then with to have aded ? What Thall
then appear momentous, what trifling
in human condual~ ?-Let th~e sober s~enti-
ments which such anticipstions s~uggest,
temper now your misplaced ardour. Let
the last conlclufions which you thall form,

entexr

8 xi.M- enter ·in~t.o the pres~ent estimate, which you

m-'-~ake of th~e wo-rld a-nd -of ~lifer

Molreover in commnuning with your-

·elvres concer-nin~g the world, contemplate
-it a~s fubjeat to the ~Divine dominion. The
greater part of men behold nothing more
than the rotation of human affairs. They
fete a great crowd ever in motion; the
.fortunes of men alternately rising and
falling; virtue often diffreffed, and pro-
fperity appearing to be the purchase of
worldly wis~dom. But this is only the
oxrtfide of ·thin~gs. tBehind ·the. curtain,
ther~e is a far greater Scene, which is be-
held by none but .the retired, religious
Spedator. Lift up that cuartain, when
you are alone~with Go~d. View the wordd
wi~th -th~e .ey~e of a Chrifitianl; and you
thall fee, that while mann's heazrt dewf~ethb
his .weay it is the Lord who direlet h Al
fe~ps. You thall fee, tza~t however men
appear to ~mo~ve and adt after their owvn
pleafute, theyi are, nevertheless,~ retained
in Tecret bonds by the Almighty, ~and all
their operations, -render~ed fubfiervient to

the

the ends of his moral government. You SE RXM.
thall behold him obliging the ·wrath of cv
mnan to prarfe him; punishing the finner
by means of his own iniquities; from
the trials of the righteous, bringing forth
their reward; and to a slate of seeming
univerfral confution, preparing the wisest
and most equitable iirue. While the
fa/hion of this wrcorld is pafliug fast away,
you thall discern the glory of another
rising to fCucceed it. You thall behold
all human events, our griefs and our
joys, our love and our hatred, our charac-
ter and memory, absorbed in the ocean
of eternity; and no trace of our prefeat
existence left, except its being for ever weell
wiith5 thCe rigphteous, and ill ·with the weicked.
---Such a view of the world, frequent-
ly prelented to our minds, could not fail to
enforce those s~olemn conclusions; 'Tere~ is
no wr/dom, nor couAnJIr agazin th5e Lorda.
Fear God, and keep hisr commanndmnents ; for

Vo L. I. S III. C~on-

S~ER M. III. COMM~UNE with yours heart, con-

IX. Scernmng yourselves, and yrour real charac-

ter. To acquire a therough kinowledge of
ourselves, is an altta~inment no less difficult
than important. For menare generally
u.nwill~ing to fiee thei-r own imrperfettions;
and when the-y are willing to e·nquire into
thfem, their felf-love impotfes on their
judgment. Their intereourfe with one
another a~ssists the delution to which, es
themselves, they are prone. Fror the or-
dinary -comnmerce of the; world is a com-
Inerce of flat~tery and falsehood 3 ·where
reciprocally they; deceive, and are deceirv-
ed a where every one a~ppears under- an as-
frumed form, profeffes efleem which he
does not feel, and beffows praise in order
to receive it. It is only in retreat, w~here
those false fe~mblances difappeatr, and
those flattering voices are silent, that a
man can learn to think soberly of himself,;
and as be oug~ht to think.

*· It has been said, that there are three

charafters which every man f~uffains;
and these~ often extremely ,di~fferent from

one

one another: One, which he poffeffes in SE lM.
his own opinion ; another, which he car- cs
ries in the effimation of the world; and
a third, which he bears in the judgment
of God. It is only the last w~thich afcer-
tains what he really is.--Whether the chia-
radter which the world forms of you, be
above or below the truth, it imports you
not much to know. But it is of eternal
conf'equence, that the charadter which you
possess in your own eyes, be formed up-
on that which you bear in the fight of
God. In order to try it by this great stand-
ard, you muff lay aside, as much as poffi-
ble, all partiality to yourse~lves ; and in
the se~ason of retirement, ex~plore your
heart with such accurate ferutiny, as may
bring your hidden defeas to light.

Enquire for this purpos~e, whether you

be not cons~cious, that: the fair opinion
which the world entertains of you, is
founded on their partial knowledge, both
of your abilities and your virtues? Would
you be willing that all your aa~ions thoauld
be publicly canv-assed ? Could you b~ear

SER M. to have your thoughts laid open ? Are

L -.)there no parts of your life which you

wyould be uneasy if an enemy could dif-
cover ? In what light, then, muff these
appear to God ? When you have kept
free of vice, has your innocence proceed-
ed from purity of principle, or from
worldly motives ? Rife there no envy or
malignity within you, when you compare
your ow~rn condition with that of others ?
H~ave you been as solicitous to regulate
your he~art, as to preserve your manners
from reproach ? ProfefiTng yourselves to
be Christians, has the Spirit of Christ ap-
peared in your conduat Declaring that
y-ou hope for immortality, has that hope
farmounted undue attachmen~ts to the
present life ?

Su ch i n veftigation as this, feriou fly pur-

fbled, mTighS~t produce to every man many
difcovePries of himself; dis~coveries not
pleanfin, perhaps, to vanity, but failutary
aInd dieful. F~or he can be only a flat-
terer, but no true friend to himself, w~ho
raims n~ot at know-ing his own~r defeits, as

wcell as virtues. By imposing on the world, SE RXM
hte may carry on some plan of fancied pro- yl
fit; but by imposing on his heart, what
can he propose to gain ? He feedeth of`
ashe~s: .d deceived heart h~ath tured him
aJide, that he cannot deliver his foul, nor·
lay,; is here not a lie in m~y right hand *?

Tues I have set before you, some of

those great objeAs, which ought to em-
ploy your m~editation in religious retire-
meat. I have endeavoured to introduce
you into a proper intercours~e with your
hear t, concerning God, the world, and
your own charader. Let this intercourse
terminate in fixing the principles of your
future condud2. Let it serve to introduce
codif~ency into your life. Nothing can
be more wavering and disjointed, than
thet behlaviour of those: who are wholly
men of the world, and have never been
inured to commiune with thems~elves.
DifiTpation is a more frequent caus~e of
their ruin, than determined impiety. It

s&ER M. is not to~ much becaus~e they have adopted
~.; ; ba-d principles, as becad~e they have never

attended to principles of any kind, that
their lives are so full of incoherence. and
diforder.-You hover on the borders of fin
and duty. One day you read the ~scrip-
tures, you hear religious dis~courses, and
form good resolutions. Next day, you
plunge into the wrorld, and forget the fe-
rious i~mpression, as if it had been neve~r
made. The impression is· again renewed,
and again effaced; and in this circle your
l~ife revolves. Is s~uch condudt worthy of
creatures endowed wi th intelligen t powers?
Shall the c-lose of life overtake you, before
you have determined how to life ? Shall
the day never come, that is to find you
fleady in your views, decided in your
plans, and en~gaged in a course of a~tion
which your mind approves ?-If you with
that day ever to arrive, retirement and
meditation rmuff first bring you home to
you~rselves·, from the dissipation in which
you are now feasttered;- muff teach you
to fix such aims, and to layi down s~uch

ruletS

rules of condua, as are fauitable to ra- 8 E ·M.
tional and immortal beings. Then will
your charaeter b~ecolte uniform and
refpedtable. Then you may hope, that
your slife will proceed in such a train as
thall prepare you, when it is finished,
for joining the society of more exalted
piPrits.

men believe religion to be a wif~ie and ra-
tional rule of condua, unless they relish
it as agreeable, and find it to carry its

in the conflidt of desire between God and
the world, can oppose not only argu-

ofa flattering world,the certain experience

is the temper and spirit of a devout man.
Such was the charadter of Cornelius, that-
good centurion, wehofe prayers and alms
are ai~gd to have come ucp in memiorial beP-
fore God. Of this charadter I intend,
through Divine afif~tance, to difcourf~; and
shall endeavour, I. T~Eo explain the nature

SER Kdi- of devotion; II[. To justify, andb recom.i

~C~CJ mend it; and, Ill. Toi redtify- some mif-

takes concerning it.

I. DEVorrosN is the lively exrcife of

thcrft affeaionsj which we owe; to the
S~upreme Being. It comi~preh-eads feverall
emiotions of th-e. heart, wh~ich all termi-
na-te on the fasme great objea.i The chief
of them are, veneraition, gratituide, desire,
and resignation.,

It: implies, frirf, profound vieneration

of God. By venetiration, I underitand an
affedion compounded of awe and love;
thre affed~ian whichi, of all oth~ers, it best
becomrtes creatures to bear tow~ards their
iinfinitely perfed Creator. Awe is the
fitrfl~ entiment that rise~s int thfe foul, at
the view of his greatness. But, in the
heart of a devoiut man, it is a foleran arid
elevating, not a defeAing em~otion ; for
he gloves r~ath~er than tremrbles, ini the
D~iv~ine presence. It is not the fupperfli-
tious dread of unknowiin power, but the
hornage yielded by the heart to himi who

is, at once, the greatest and the benft oBe- S E M.
ings. Omni~potence, viewed alone, would ~~
be a formidable objeat. But: considered
in conjunaljon with the moral perfecaiots·
of the Divine NJature, i~t serves to heighten:
devotion. Goodnes~s afefeds the heart with
double energy, when residing in, One to·
exalted. The goodnes~s wPhich we adore
in him, is not like that which is com~mon
among men, a weak, mutable, undifc~ern-
ing fondness, ill quali~fied to be the ground
of assured trust. It is the goodness~ of a
perfed G~overnor, ading upon a regu-
lar exteniive plan; a fleady principle
of benevolenee, condu~ed by wifdorn;
which, fuzbjeA to no variablenefi or fha-
dowe of` turning·, free from all partiality
and caprice, incapable of being either
soothed by flattery, or ru~f~ed by refrent-
ment, resembles, in its calm and equal
luffre, the eternal se~renity of the highest
h~eavens. 'Thy mer~cy, O Lord/ ! tis the~ be~a-
venls, and thy faithfulne/s reacheth unto the
cloueds. 'Thy righ~teouf~ne/s is like the Pgrea
ilnountains, and thy judgments are agrear depth.

Such

SER M. Such are the conceptions of the great

c1 God, which fill with veneration the heart

of a devout man. His veneration is not
confined to adts .of immediate worthip.
It is the habitual temper of his foul. Not
only when engaged~ in prayer or praif'e,
but in the silence of retirement, and even
amidst the occupations of the wo~rld, thne
Divine Being dwells upon his thoughts.
No place, and no objea, appear to him
void of God. On the wrorks of Nature,
he views thle imprefiron of his hand;
and in the adLions of men, he traces
the operation of his Providence. What-
ever he beholds on ea~rth, that is beau-
tiful or fair, that is great or good, he
refers to God, as to the supreme origin
of all the excellence which is scattered
throughout his works. From thos~e effefts
he rise~s to the first caure. 1From thofce
fireams, he ascends to thle fountain whence
they flow. By thorfe rays, he is led to
that eternal source of light in which they

ce@ntre.

DEVOTIoN

DEVOTION implies, secondly, sincere 8 E KM

dlevotion to God, for all his benefits. u
This is a warmer emotion than rimple ve-
neration. Veneration looks up to the
D~eity, as he is in hims~elf ; gratitude re-
gards what he is towards us. When a
devout man surveys this vast universe,
where beauty and goodness are every
where predominant; when he refle~ts on
thos~e numberles~s multitudes of creatures,
who in their different flations, enjoy the
blefirngs of exiflence; and when at the
fame time he looks up to an Universal
F~ather, who hath thus filled creation with
life and happiness, his heart glows within
him. He adores that difinterefied good-
neifs, which prompted the Almighty to
raise up So many orders of in~telligent be-
ings, not that he might receive, but that
he might give and impart; that he might
pour forth hims~elf, and communicate to
the s~pirits whichl he formed, some ema-1
nations of his ~felicity.

The goodnes~s of this Supreme Benef~ac5-

tor he gratefully contemplates, as display-

SIE RM· ed in his own slate. He reviews the

--.~events of his life; and in every corn-

fort which has sweetened it, he discerns
~the Divine hand. Does he remember
with affe~tion the parents under whose
care he grew up, and the companions
with whom he passed his youthfu~l life ?
Is he now happy, in his family rising
around him; in the s~pous~e who loves
h~im, or in the children who give him
comfort and joy ? Into every tender re-
membrance of the past, and every pleas-
ing enjoyment of the present, devotion
enters; for in all those belovred obje£1s,
it recognizes God. The communaication
of' love from heart to heart, is an effuiion,
of his goodnes~s. From his inspiration,
des~cends all the friendship which ever
glow-ed on earth - and therefore to him it
justly returns in gratitu~de and terminates
on him~.

Biut this life, wcith all its interests, is

but a fmiall part of human existence. A
d~evout mIan looks f'orward to imcmortali-
ty, anrd dircovers st-ill higher faubjeds of

gratitude.

gratitude. He~ views himfrelf s a guilty SERM.n
creature, whom Divine benignity has re-
ceived into grace; ~wh~ose forfeited hopes
it has reffored ; and to whom it has open-
ed the meft glorious profpe~ts of future
felicity. Such generosity thowrr to the
faHen and ·miserable~, is yet more affe61-
ing to the heart, than favours conferred
on the innocent. He contemplates, with
affoniihment,· the labours of the Son of
God,in accomplithing redemption for men;
and his foul overflows with thankfulnef's
to hi m, w~ho loved us, and weaJhethE us from
our fins in his own blood.-Wh5at jhall I ren-
der to thSe Lord for all his benefits? Bless
th~e Lordk, O my jo~ul ! and all thalt is weid~thin
m7e, blejs his holy name ; who forg~iveth all
thine ziniquities, and hrealth all thy di/eafes ;
whoa redeemethS-thy i~fe fromn def rdtion, and
cr-owneth thee ·with loving kindne/s and weith
t ender mercies.

DEVO TIoN implies, thirdly, the desire

of the foul after the favour of the Su-
preme Being, as its chief good, and final

reft.

SER M- reft. To inferior enjoyments, the devout

L man allots inferior and fecondlary attach-

ment. He disclaims not every earthly as-
fedion. He pretends not to renounce all
pleasure in the comforts of his pres~ent
slate. Such an unnatural renunciation
humaniity forbids, and religion cannot: re-
quire. But from there he expeats not
hris supreme blis~s. He discerns the vanity
which belongs to them all; and beyond
the circle of mutable objeats which f~ur-
round him, he aspires after fbme prin-
ciples of more perfea felicity, which thall
not be; fubjeQ to change or decay. But
wthere is this complete and permanent
goodl to be found ? Ambition perf~ues
it in courts and p~alaces 3 and returns
from the purfuiiit, loaded w~rith sorrows.
Pleaf'ure seeks it among fed~ual joys.

pIne ls

p)iners dwells with God; and from the SERM.
l gbt of his countenance, it bea ms upon the -
devout man. His voice is, Whom Base I
in heaven but thtee ? and there is none tponz
earth that Idefre le/de thec. After ex-
ploring heaven and earth for happineis,
they f'eem to him a inighty void, a wil-
dernefrs of tadowvs, where all wouldt be
empty and uns~ubstantial without God.
But in his favour anld love, he finds wMhat
Aupplies every defed of temporal objed~s;
and affutes tritquillity to his heart, amjidt
all the changes of his existence. 'Thou~halt
guide me woith thY coutnfel; and thou jhalt re-
ceiire ine to thy glory. M~y fe/h and my
heart failethb; but God is the~treng~th of my

FRorC these sentiments and aff-e£1ions,

Devotion advances, fourthly, to an· entire
resignation of the fToul to God. It is the
consummation of truss and hope. It baz-
nifhes anxious cares, and murmuring
thoughts. It reconciles us to· every ap-

can any devotion be genuine, which in- v-
ipires not sentiments of this nature. For
devotion is not to be considered as a tran-
fient glow ofaffeaion, occaiioned by some
casual imprei~ions of Divine goodness,
which are fu~ffered to remain unconneaetd
with the condu~t of life. It is a power-
ful principle, which penetrates the f~oul;
which pu~rifies the affeations from debaf'-
ing attachments; and by a fixed and
ficady regard to God, s~ubdues every fin-
ful pafflon, and forms the inclinations to
piety and virtue.

S cH in general are the difpolitions

that conflitute devotion. I~t is the union
of veneration, gratitude, desire, and re-
fignation. It expresses not to much the
performance of any particular duty, as
the spirit which muff animate all religi-
ous duties. It flands opposed, not mere-
ly to downright vice; but to a heart
which is cold, and ins~ensible to fatcred
things; which, from compulflon perhaps,

~ regard to the divine commands, but

obeys them without ardour, love, or joy.
I proceed,

EII To recommend this devout spirit.

to your imitation. I begin with obf~erv.
ing, that it: is of the utmost consequence
to guard againff extremes of every kind
in religion. 'We muff beware, left~, by
seeking to avoid one rockr, we plitt upon
another. It has boeen long the fabjeet of
remark, that f~uperftituion and enthdkiafin
are two capital s~ources of dfelefion; fu-
perflition on the one hand, attaching
men, with immoderate zeal, to the ritual
and external part of reli~gion; an~d enthu-
fliafii on the other, dtiretting their whole
attention to internal emot~ions, and m-yfti-
cal communications with the spiritual
world; while neither the one, nor the
other, has paid fufficient regard to the
great moral duties of the Chriffian life.
But running with intemperate eagerness
from ther~e two great abules of relig~ion,

rnen

mren ha ve negleaed to obs~erve, that there 8 ER M.
are extremes opposite to each of them, in- ·-
to which they are in hazard of precipi-
tating themselves. Thus the horror of
f~uperflition has fomnetimes reached to far,
as to produce contempt for all external
inflitutions; as if it were pofirble for re-
ligion to fubifit in the world, without
forms of worthip, or public acknow-
ledgment of God. It has also happened,
that some who in the main are well as-
feAed to the cause~ of goodness, obferv-
inlg that persons of a devout turn have
at times been carried, by warm affeations,
into unjufitfiable excesses, have thence
hlaffily concluded, that all devotion was
akin to enthusiasm; and, separating reli-
gion totally from the heart and affeAions,
hlave reduced it to a frigid observance of
what they call the rules of virtue. This
is the extreme which I purpos~e at present:
to combat, by showing you, firit, that:
true devotion is rational, and well found-
ed; next, that it is of the highest im-
portance to every other part of religion

and

8 ER M. and virtue; and, laffly, that it is most

·, -Jconducive to our happinelfs.

IN the first place, True devotion is ra-

tional and well founded. It takes its rife
from affeLaions which are essential to the
human frame. We are formed by Nature,
to admire what is great, and to love
what is amiable. Even inanimate objeds
have power to excite those emotions.
The magnificent profpeAs of the natural
world, fill the mind with reverential awe.
Its beautiful s~cenes create delight. When
we su~rvey the adians and behaviour of
our fellow-creatures, the affec~ions glow
with greater ardour; and, if to be un-
moved, in the former cafe, argues a defed
of sensibility in our powers, it discovers,
in thie latter an odious hardnes~s and de-
pravity in the hieart. The tenderneis of
an affeaionate parent, the generosity of a
forgiving enemy, the public s~pirit of a
patriot or a hero, often fill the eyes with
tears, and fwvsell the breast with~ emotions
too big for utterance. The obje of thos~e

aiFfed ious

affe~tions is frequently raised above us, in SE RIVI.
condition and rank. Let us uppofe him ·
rais~ed also above us, in nature. Let us
imagine, that an Angel, or any being of
superior order, had condefcended to be
our friend, our guide and patron i no
person, ifue w~ould hold the exaltation of
h7is benefa~or's charadter, to be an argu-
mnent why he thould love and revere him
less -Strange that the attachment and
veneration, the warmth and overflowing
of heart, which excellence and goodness
on every other occasion command, thould
begin to be accounted irrational, as soon
as thleSupremeBeing becomes their objea.
For what reason must human fedfibility be
extinat towards him alone ? Are all bene-
fits entitled to gratitude, except the highest
and the best ?Shall goodness ceals: to be
amisble, only because it is perfed .

It will perhaps be said, that an un-

known and invisible being, is not qluali-
fied~ to raise affeaion in the human heart.
Wrapt up in the myfierious obscurity of
his nature, he esc~apes our search, and as-

fords

s ER 1M. fords no determinate objeat to our love or

G ~desire. W~e g~o faorward, but be is not there;

and backwaersd, but wee cannot perceive
h~im on the left hand wh~ere he weork-
Bth, but ro cannot behold him : He bid-
Eth hJimfelf on th~e right hacnd, that we
cannot eec him* .-N-PIotwithfiandi ng this
obscurity, is there any being in the uni-
verse~ more real and certain, than the Cre-
ator of the world, and the Supporter of
all exiffence ? Is he, inZ whtom wer-live aind
movLe, too difiant from us to exrcite devo-
tion ? His form and essence, indeed,
we cannot fee; but to be unf'een, and
imperfea~ly known, in many other in-
flances, precludes neither gratitude nor
love. It is not the fight, so much as the
firong conception, or deep impression, of
an objea, which affeas the paiiions. We
glow with admiration of personages, wvho
have lived in a diifantage. Whole na-
tions have been transported with zeal and
affeaion, for the generous hero, or pub-
lic deliverer, whom they knew only by

*t Job xxxiiL, 8, 9, ~fa m e.

fame. Nay, properly speaking, the direB SIxM
obljea of our love, is in every cafe, in- cr
viiible. For that on which affe~tion is
placed, is the mind, thle foul, the internal
charaLfter of our fellow-creatures a which
surely is no les~s concealed, than the Di-
vine Nature itielf is, from the view of
sense. From ations we can only infer
the difpolitions of men; from what we
fee of their behaviour, we colled~ what
is invisible; but the conjeaure which we
form, is, at best, imperfer2; and when
their a~tions excite our love, much of
their heart remains still unknown. I afkc
then, in what refpedt God is les~s qualified
than any other being, to be an objeat of
affe~tion .2 Convinced that he exists, be-
holding his goodnes~s spread abroad in his
works, exerted in the government of the
world, displayed in faome measure to se~nse,
in the adtions of his Son Jesus Christ are
we not furniihed with every essential re-
quifite which the heart demands, in order
to indulige the most warm, and at the
fame time the mnoft rational emotions ?

B ER M. If thefre considerations justify the rea.

c ~`-1 onablenef~s of devotion, as expressed in

veneration, love, and gratitude, the fagme
train of thought will equally juffify it
when appearing in the forms of desire,
delight, or resignation. The latter are
indeed the consequence of the former.
F3or we cannot but desire some communi-
cation wfth what we love; a~nd wcilll na··
turally resign ou~rselves to one, on whom!
we have placed the full confidence of
affedtion. The aspirations of a devout
man after the favour of God, are the
effeats of that earnest with for happiners,
which glows in every breast. All ren
ha ve somewhat that may be called the
objeAt of their devotion, reputation,
pleasure, learning, riches, or whatever
aIpparent good has firongly· attached their
heart. This becomes the centre of at-
trad~ion, which- draws them towards it;
which quickens and regulates all their
miotions. W~hile the mten of the world
are thus influenced by the objeats which
they severally worfhiip, thall he only

wrho

who direAs all his devotion towards the SE ~M.
Supreme Being, be excluded from a place ~c
in the ijyftem of rational condua ? or be
censured for having pafirons, whole fen-
fibility corresponds to the great cause
which moves them ?--Having vindicated
the reasonableness of devotion, I come,

IN the s~econd place, to thowT its im-

portance, and the high place which it
poffeffes in the ijyfiem of religion. I ad-
dress myself now to thor~e, who, though
they rejeat not devotion as irrational, yet
confider it as- an unnecessary refinement ;
an attainment which may be safely left to
recluse and f~equeffered persons, who aim
at uncommon fagnaity. The solid and:
material duties of a good life, they hold
to be in a great meas~ure independent of
devout affe~tion; and think them f~uffi-
ciently supported, by their necessary con-
neation with their interest, both in this
and in a future world. They insist much
upon religion being a calm, a sober, and
rational principle of conduft.-Ir admit

that

S EUR M. that it is very laudable to have a rational

\ religion. But I muff admonith you, that

it is both reproachful and criminal, to
have an inf'enfible heart. If we reducere-
ligion into so cool a slate, as not to admit
love, affeation, and desire, we thall leave
it in poffefflon of sm~all influence over
human life. Look abroad into the world,
and observe how few ad upon deliberate
and rational viewcs of their true interest.
The bulk of manktind are impelled by
their feelings. They are attradted by ap-
pearances of good. Taste and inclination
rule their condudt. To dire&t their irnclin-
ation and tasse towards the highest ob-
jeas, to form a relish within them, for
virtuous and [piritual enjioyment; to in-
troduce religion into the heart, is the pro-
vince of devotion, and hence arises its
importance to the interests of goodness.

Agreeably to this domrine, the great

Author of our religion, who well knew
wh~at wa~rS in mrEan, laidl the foundation of
his whole iiyfiem in the regeneration of
the hleart. The change which was to be

accornplifhed

purpose toeffeat, merely by regulatmng
thei'r external conducr; but by forming
within them a new nature; by taking
aw~ay th5e hear~t of sone, aznd givJing themn
a beart of fe/h, that is, a heart relenting
and tender, yielding to the Divine im-
pulse, and readily susceptible of devout
imprefirons. 'Thou shalt lov the LoPrd thy
God, weith all th~y hJeart, and mind, anda' ful
and frength: 'This is the fr} and great
comrmadtient. M~y olp give me th~y hart,
is the call of God to each~ of us : And,
indeed, if thie heart be withheld,` it is
not easy to conceive what other offering
wte can pref'ent, that wijll be acceptable
to him.

Of what nature muff that man's religi-

on be, who profeffes to worth~ip God,
and to believe in Christ; and yet ratifes
his thoughts towards God, and his Savi-
our without any warmith of gratitude or
love; I s~peak not of those occasional die-
cays of pious affeation, to which the best·
are filhjedt, but of at total inse~nsibility to

8 EyR M this part of religion. Surely, let the out-

,~S~Jward behaviour be ever so irreproachable,

there must be s~ome essential defe £ in a
heart which remains always unmoved at
the view of infinite goodness. The as-
fettions cannot, in this cafe, be deemed
to flow in their natural channel. Some
concealed malignity muff have tainted
the inward ~frame. This- is not the man
whom you would chufe for your bsofor
friend; or whole heart you could expe8'
to adwier, with reciprorcal warmth, to
yours. His virtue, if it deserves that
name, is not of t~he mooft amiable fort;
and may, with r~eason, receive the appel-
lation (often injudicionfly beffowed) ofi
cold and dry morality. Such a person
must, as yet, be far from the king-dow~ of'
Heaven.

As devotionl is thus essential to religion

;n its principle, so it enters into the pro-
per dis~charge of all its duties. It diffuides
an auspicious influence over the whole
of virtue. The prevailing temper of the
minjd is formed by its most frequent em-

ployments·

ployments. Intercours~e with fipreme per- E MPr.
feaion cannot, therefore, but ennoble
and improve it. The pure love of God,
naturally conneAs its~elf with the love of
man. Hence, devotion has been often
found a powerful infirument, in huma-
nizing the manners of men, and taming
their unruly pafflons. It smooths what
is rough, and softens what is fierce, in,
our nature. It is the great purifier of
the as feations. It inspires contempt of the
low gratifications belonging to animal
life. It promotes an humble and cheerful
contentment with our lot j and s~ubdues
that eager desire of riches and of power,
which has filled this unhappy world yi~th
crimes and miifery. Finally, it beffows
that enlargement of heart in the s~ervice
of God, which is the great principle,
both of perfeveranlce, and of progres~s in
virtue. He who, unacquainted with de-
vout affe~tiorns, sets himself to keep the
Divine commandments, wll advance in
obedience with a flow and languid pearce;
like one who, carrying a heavy burden,

toils

8'E R M. toils to mount the hill. But he wholek
·-- - heart devotion has warmed, w~ill proceed

on hlis way, cheerful and rejoicing. The
one performs his duty, only because it is
comnmanded; the other, becatif~e~ he loves
it. The one is in~clined to, do no stiore
than necessity requires; the other seeks
to excel. The one looks for hris reward
i~n somewhat besides religion ; the othier,
finds it in religion its~elf: it is h5is meat arrd
drinjlk to do the wi/llofthbat; heave~nly Fath~er,
wh·om he loves and adores. Wlhich of
there two are likely to make the greatest
improvement in goodness, is edil:y dif-
cerned. Let: us now confider,

la the third place, the influence or de-

votion on the happines~s of i~fe. WhVate'ver
promotes and firengthens virtue, what-
ever calms anid regulates the temper, is a
source of happiness. Devotion, as Ihave
just: nowv thown, produces throfe e~ffeass in
a remarkable degree. It inspires coinpo-
furre of sp~irit, mildness, arid benignity;
weakens the painfid, anid cherith~es the

pleasing

pleasing emotions i and by these means, SE 191
carries on the life of a pious man in a --
fmnooth and placid tenor.

Besides exerting this habitual influenc~e

on the mind, devotion opens a field of
enjoyments, to which the vicious are en-
tire firangers ; enjoyments the more valu-
able, as they peculiarly belong to retire-
ment when the world leaves us, and to
adversity when it becomes our foe. These
are the two fIeafons, for which every wife
man would most with to provide some
hidden flore of comfort. For-let him- be
plaiced in the moss fravou rable situat~ion
which the human slate admits, the world
can neither always amule him, nor al-
ways thield him from diffrei~s. -There
will -be many hours of vacuity, and
many of dejeation in his life. If he be
a firanger to God, and to devotion, how
dreary will the gloom of solitude often
prove ? Writh what oppressive weight wild~
sickness, disappointment, or old age, fall
upon his spirits ? But fror those: pensive
periods, the pious man has a relief pre-

8fEIRK pared. From the tirefame r~epetition of

Sthe common vanities of life, or frorn the
painful corrosion o~f its cares and forrowNs,
devotion tranrpor·ts him into a new re-
gion; and furrounrds him there with such
objefts, as are the most fitted to cheer the
dejecaion, to calm the tumults, and to
heral the wounds of his hea~rt. If the
world has been empty and del~utive, it
giaddens 'him with the prof~pelt of a
higher anid better order of things, about
to arise. If men have been wvagrat~eful
and baCfe~ it displa;ys; before him the
faithfulnef~~is of that Supreme Being, who,
though every other friend fail, will never
forfaske him. Cogfujt: your experience,
and you will find, that the two greatest
sources of inward joy, are the exercifb of
love direded towards a deserving objer5,
and the exercise of hope terminating on
some high and affuzred happineifs. Both
thes~e are s~upplied by devotionj and
therefore we have no redoan to be f~ur-
prifed, if on some occallous, it fill the
h~earts of good men with a iFatisfa~tion
not to be expressed. The

TPhe refinped pleas~ures of a pious mind, SER M.

are in many refpeas s~uperior to the cr
coarse gratifications of sense. They are
pleas~ures wyhich belong to the highest
powers, and best affeaions of the foul;
whereas the gratifications of ifenf~e reside
in the lowest region of our nature. To
the one the foul sloops below its native
dignity. The other, raiie it above jitelf.
The one, leave always a comfortless, often
a mortifying, remembrance behind them.
The other, are reviewed with applauie
and delight. The pleasures of fenfre re-
femble a foaming torrent, which, after a
disorderly course, speedily runs out and
leaves an empty and offenfive channel.
But the pleas~ures of devotion resemble
the equable current of a pure river,
which enlivens the fields through which
it passes, and diffufes verduree and ferti-
lity along its banks.--To thee, O Devo-
tion ! we owe the: highest improvement of
our nature, and much of the enjoyment
of our life. Thou art the furppor-t of our
virtue, and the reft of our fouls, in this

Thou exalteft the heart. Thy cornmu-

to the low no les~s than to the high; to
the poor as well as to the rich. In thy
presence, worldly diftinations cease s and
under thy influence, w~orldly sorrows are
forgotten. Thou art the balm of the
wvounded mind. Thiy fandtuary is ever
open to the miferable'; inacceifilble only
to the unrighteous and impure. Thou

In thee the hoffs of angels and blessed

tha t,

J J . I EN DEAV OUR to correat some

errors, into 'which men are apt to fall
concerning devotion. For it is but too
obvious that errors are often committed
in this part of religion. These frequently
disfigure its appearance before thle world,
and fubjea it to unjuff reproach. Let us
therefore attend deliberately to its naturfe,

so as to distinguish pure and~rational de. SE RM.
votion, of which I have hitherto treated, .-_
from that which is, in any degree, f'puri-
ous and adulterated.

In the first place, It is an error to

place devotion in the mere performance
of any external a~t of worship. Prayer
and praise, together with the ordinances
peculiar to the Christian religion, are the
appointed means of raising the heart to-
wards the Supreme Being. They are the
jinfituted ligns of devot ion ; the language
in which it naturally expresses itfell. But:
let us remember, that they are signs and
expressions only; and we all know, that,
in various cafes, these may not corres~pond
to the thing signified. It is in the dif~po-
fition of the heart, not in the motion of:
the lips, or in the posture of the body,
that devotion consists. The heart may
pray or praise, when no words are utter-
ed. But if the heart be unconcerned or
ill affeited, all the words we can utter,
how properly framed soever, are no other
than empty and unacceptable founds in
'he ear of t~he Almighty.

Ish*

8 ER IV. IN the fCeconad place, It is an error to

., conceive the pleasures and advantages of

devotion to be indifecriminately open to
all. Devotion, like many parts of religi-
on, may in some lights be considered as
a privilege, and in others as a duty. It
is the duty of all, to love God, and to re-
sign themselves to his will. But it is the
privilege of good men only, to rejoice mh
God, and to confide in his friendfhlip.
Hence a certain preparation is requisite,
for the enjoyment of devotion in its whole
extent.' Not only must the life be re-
formed from gross enormities, but the
heart must. have undergone that change
which the Golpel demands. A competent
knowledge of God must be acquired. A
proper foundation must be laid in faith
and repentance, for intercourse with
H~eaven.

They who would rush all at once from

the arms of the world, into the sacred
retreat of devotion; they who imagine
that retreat to fland always ready for the
recetption of s~uch as betake thems~elves to

it, for no reafoo, but because every other 8 E Ml.
refu e excludes them, betray gross igzio- .....
rance of this part of rehigion. 'they brnag
to it faculties unqualified to ta~ste its plea-
foures ; and they grasp at hopes, to which
they are not entitled. B~y incorporating
with devrotion the unnatural mrixture of
their unfandtified pafioins, they defile and
corrupt it. Hence that gloom which h~as
often spread over it. Hence, thos~e fper-
flitious mrortifications and sufferities, by
which the fallely devout hope to purchase
favour from God a haunted by the ter-
rors of a guilty confcienlce, and vrainly
firuggling to substitute a fiervile and
cringing homage, in the room of the pure
affeatiorns of a renewed heart. On su~ch
altars tfie hallowned fire of true devotion
cannot burn ; not can any inenf~e a~scend
from them, that thall be grateful to H~ea-
ven. Bringno more aain oblations. W~as
ye, mnake you clean, put awa~y the ev'l of'r
your doings from before mnine eyes, faith the
Lord. 'Ceafe to do evil, l'ean to do well.
Then drawre nigh to God, and ?bp e ill drawe

nigh

SE M. nigh t~oyou.-B-·ut though devotion re-

~L-yC3quires a pure heart, and a virtuous life,

and necessarily supposes the exercise of
frequent retirement, I muff obfrerve,

IN the third place, That it is an error

to conceive it as requiring an entire re-
treat from the wvorld. Devotion, like
every other branch . of religion, was in-
tended to fit us for dis~charging the duties
of life. We serve God, by being ofeful
to one another. It is evident fr~om the
frame of our nature, and from our corn-
mon necessities and wants, that we were
designed by Providence for an adive part
on this earth. The Gosp~el of Christ, ac-
cordingly considers us as engaged in the
concerns of the world; and direats its
exhortations to men, in all the various re-
lations, charaders, and employments of
civil life. Abffradtion from society, there-
fore, and total dedication of our time to
devout exercis~es, cannot be the most pr~o-
per method of acquiring the favour of
God .

I mean

I mean not, however, to throw any SERK·M

blame on thore, who having loft all reliih c-
for' the ordinary pursuits of life, in con-
sequence of severe wounds wvhich they
have received from a~ffiftion , who, be-
ing left to stand alone, and discerning
their connedtions with the world to be
in some meafurre broken off, choo~e to
s~eek tranquillity in a religious retirement,
and to consecrate their days entirely to
God. Situations sometimes occur, whiqh~
both juff ify a great degree of retreat from
the world, and entitle it to refp~ea. But
with regard to the bulk of mankind,
Christian devotion neither requires nor
implies any such fequeffration from the
affairs of men. Nay, for the most prt,
it will be cultivated with greater s~ucces~s
by those who mingle it with the ad~ive
employments of life. For the mind,
when entirely occupied by any one ob-
jeR, is in hazard of viewing it at lafl
thirough a falle medium. Objeas, ef~pe-
cially, so great and s~ublime as those of
devotion, when we attempt to fix upon

them

sER MI them unreinitting attention, overitretch

,X~.and disorder out feeble powers. The

mind, by being relaxed, returns to them
with more advantage. As none of our
organs cain bear intense s~ensations without
injury; as the eye when dazzled with
overpowerinlg light, beholds imaginary co-
lours, and loses the real diftin~tion of ob-
jeats; so the mind when overheated by
perpetual contemplationofceleftial thinrgs,
has been sometimes found to m~itake the
firong impressions of fan7cy, for fuperna-
tural communications from above. To the
employments of devotion, as to all other
things, there are due limits. There is a
certain temperate s~phere, within which it
preserves longest its proper exertion, and
most f~uccefsfully promotes the purpores
for which it was designed.

IN the fourthi place, It is anl error to

imagine, that devotion enjoins a total
contempt of all the pleasures and amuse
ments of human society. It checks, in-
deed, that s~pirit of dissipation which is

tloo

too prevalent. It not only prohibits plea- SER M.
furres which are unlawful, but likew~ise ls4 3
that unlawful degree of attachment to
pleasures in themselves innocent, which
withdraws the attention of man from
what is serious and important. But it
brings amusement under due limitation,
without extirpating it. It forbids it as
the busines~s; but permits it as the re-
laxation, of life. For there is nothingiiq .
the [pirit of true religion, which is hoffile
to a cheerful enjoyment of our situation
in the world.

They who look with a severe and in-

dignant eye, upon all the recreations by
wYhich t-he cares of men are relieved, and
the union of faciety is cemented, are, in
two refpeets, injurious to religion. Firit,
they exhibit it to others under a forbid-
ding form, by clothing it with the garb
of fomuch unnecessary aufferity. And
next, they deprive the world of the be-
nefit which their example might afford,
in drawing the line between innocent and
dangerous pleas~ures. By a temperate par-

ra~ter always poffeffe~s, in renrainifng un-
due excers. They would thow the young
and unwary, at what poi~nt they ought
to flop. They would have -it in their
power to regulate, in some degree, ·the
public manners; to check extravagance,
to humble pres~umption, .and put vice to
the bluth. But, through injudicious fe-
verity, they fall ihort of the good they
might perform. ByT an indiferiminate cen-

. sure of all amulement, they detradt from

the weight of their reproof, when a-
muiement becomes undoubtedly sinful.
By t~otally withdrawing themselves bror
the circle of cheerful life, they deliver up
the entertainments of society, into the
hands of the loose, and the corrupted;
and permit the blind power of fashion,
uncontrolled, to e~ftabifh its own Aand-
airds, and to exercifet its dan~gerous [wvay
over. the world.

la the fifth place, Tt is an error to be- SEXR M-

lieve that devotion nourithes a spirit· of v4
severity, in judging of the mranners and
charaders .of others. Under this re-
proach, indeed, it has so long fuffered
in the world; that, with too many, the
appellation of devout, suggests no other
charader, but that of a four and reclus~e
bigot, who delights in cedrure. But the
reproach is unjuf t; for such a f'pirit is
entirely opposite to the nature of true de-
votion. The very; first traces which it
imprints on the mrind, are candour and
humility. Its principles are liberal. Its
genius is unassuming· and mild. Severe
only to itself, it makes every allowance
for others which humnanity can sugg~est.
It claims no privilege of look~ing into
their hearts, or of deciding writh refpe61
to their eternal flate.-Ilf your fuppo~ed:
devotion produce contrary effeats; if it
infuse harshness into your fentimnen ts, a nd
acrimony into your fipeech; you may
conclude, that under a s~erious appear-
snce, carnal pafirons lurk. A4nd, if ever

SER M. it thall so far lift you up with felf-con-

~ ceit, as to make you establish your own

opinions as an infallible .flandard for the
whole christian world, and lead you to
consign to perdition, all who differ from
you, either in some domtinal tenets, or in
the mode of expre~ssing them; you may
reft assured, that to much pride you have
joined much ignorance, both of the na-
ture of devotion, and of -the Gos~pel of
Chlrift. Finally,

IN the sixth place, It is an error to

think, that perpetual rapture and [~piri-
tual joy beloang to devotion. Devout
feelings admit very different degrees of
warmth and exaltation. Sorme persons,
by the frame of their minds, are much
more susceptible than others, of the ten-
der emotions. They more readily relent
at the view. of Divine goodness, glow with
a wat-rmer ardour of love, and, by con-
foquevnce, rife to a higher elevation of
.:joy and hope. But, in the midit of still
;d nlcalm aff~eaions,devotion often dwells,

and,

and, though it produce no tranirports in "BE M
the mind, diffufes over it a fleady fe- -F·
renuty. Devout fedations not only vary
in their degree according to the frame of
different tempers; but even among the
best diipof~fed, fuffer much interruption
and decay. It were too much to expeft,
that in the present slate of human frailty,·
thos~e happy feelings th~ould be uniform
and conflant. Opprefiion of worldly
cares, languor of [pirits, and infirmities
of health frequently indis~pos~e us for the
enjoyment of devout affeftions. Pious
men, on there occasions, are in hazard of
passing judgment on their own state with
too much severity; as if, for some great
iniquity, they were condemned by God
to final hardness of: heart. Hence arises
that melancholy, which has been seen to
overcloud them; and which has given
occasion to many contemptuous ficoffs of
ungodly men. But it is a melancholy
which deserves to be tereated w~ith tender-
ners, not with contempt. It is the excess
of virtuous and pious fenfibiity. It is

the ~

S EVR M the overflowing of a heart affeLted, in an

- extreme degree, with the humble s~ense

of its own failings, and with ardent con-
cern to a ttain the favour of God. ·A wNeak-
ness, however, we admit it to be, though
not a crime; and hold it to be perfedly
separable from ·the essence of devotion.
For contrition, though it may melt, ought
not to fink~i or overpower the heart of a
Christian. The tearof repentance brings
its own relief. Religio~n is a spring of
consolation, not~ of terror, to every well-
informed mind, which, in a proper man-
ner, refits its hope on the infinite good-
ness of God, and the all-fufficient merit ol

'To conclude, Liet us remove from de-

votion, all those mistakes, to which the
corruptions of men, or their ignorance
and p~rejudices, have given rife. With us

its imprefiions. And above all, let us
pray to God, that he may eftabifh its pow-
er in our heart. For here, if any where,
his, assistance is requisite. T~he sp~irit of
devotion is his gift. From his inspiration
it proceeds. Tow~ards him it tends; and

SE RMk. SO BRIE TY of mind, is one of those

,,, virtues wihich the present condition of

human life firongly inculcates. The un.·
certainty of its enjoyments, checks pre-
f~umption; the multiplicity of its dan-
gers, demand's perpetual caution. ~Mo-
deration, vigilance, and f~elf-government,
are duties incumbent on all; but efpeci-
ally on fiich as are beginning the jouarney
of life. To them, therefore, the admo-
nitionz in the Text is, with great propriety,
direflted; though there is reason to fear,
that by them it is in hazard of being

least

leaf1 regarded. Experience enforces the SEXR1\f.
admonition on the most giddy, after they ~~
have advanced in years. But the whole
slate of youthful views and passions, is
aIdverfe to sobriety of mind. The fecenes
which present themselves, at: our entering
ulpon the world, are commonly flattering.
W hate ver they be in themselves, the lively
[pirits of the young gild every opening
proipeit. The field of hope appears to
firetch wide before them. Pleas~ure seems
to put forth its blossoms on every fide.
Impelled by desire, forward they r~iuh
wijth inconsiderate ardour: prompt to
decide and to choose; averse~ to hesitate,
or to enquire; credulous, becaus~e un-
taught by experience, rath, because un-·
acquainted with danger; head-firong,
becadre unfubdued by difaLppointment.
Hence arise the perils, of which it is my
diefign at present to warn them. I thall
take fabriety of min3;d, in its mos1 compre-
htenfive sense, as including the w~hole of
that dircipline which religion and virtue
prefecribe to youth. Thou hi the words

XY 3 of

sERIM. of the Text are direetly addreired to young

· ,men, yet as the fagme admnonition is given

in a preceding verse to the other f~iex, the
infiru~ions wvhich arise fr~om the Text are
to be considered as comgmon to boath. I1
intend first, to show- them the importance
of beginning early to give fCerious atten-
tion to their condua; 5 nd next, to poinlt
out thos~e virtues which they ought chiefly~
to cultivate.

As5 soon as you are capable of reflec-

tion, yoe mnuft perceive that there is a
fight and a wrong, in human amtons.
You f'ee, that those who are born with
the fame advantages of fortune, are not
all equally prosperous in the cours~e of life.
WiShilp so~me of thiem, by wife and fleady
conduc2, attain diffinal~on in th-e world,
anld pass their days witl! comfort and ho-
nour ,, othlers of the fame rank, by mean
and vicious behaviour, forfetit the advan-
tages of their birth, involve themselves in
much ruifer~y, and end in being a dif-
. grace to their fr-iends, and a burden on

society.

society. Early, then, you riay learo, that EM
it is not on the external condition ux~-j--
wchich you find youifelves placed, but on
the part which you are to ad, that yout
welfare or unhappin~ess, your honour or
infarry, depend. Nowi, when bjeginning
toe .a that part, what cana be of greater
knoment, than to regulate .your plan of
coniduR wit~h thie most serious attention,
before you have yet committed an~y' ftal
or' irretrievrajl~e errors ? If, inficead of·
exterting telettibn for this valuable pur-
pose, you deliver yro~urfelves up, at to cri-
tiCal a time, to sloth and pleas~ure; if youi
itefufe to liflena to any counfiellor ·but hu-
mnour, o~r to aitteii~d to a~ny pursuit except
·that of amuferrrent,; if you aHow your-
selves to float loose andi careless on the
tide of .life, ready to receive any direc-
tiort whi. ch:~ .the current of' fashion mayv
chance to give you; what can you expedt
to follow -from fisch beginningsr ? While
so many around you are undergoing the
fad consequences of a like indileret~ion,
for w~hat reason shall .not those ,confe--

quences

8 E IM. quences extend to you ? Shall ydu only

~-J attain s~ucces~s without that preparation,

and es~cape dangers without that precau.
tion, which is required of others ? Shall
happ~ines~s grow up to you, of its own ac-
cord, and solicit your acceptance, wvhen,
to the reft of mankind, it is the fruit of
long cultivation, and the acquisition of
labour and care ?--Deceive not your-
fielves with s~uch arrogant hopes. What-
ever be your rank, Providence will not
for your fake, reverse its eftablithed or-
der. The author of your being hath enz.
joined you to take heed to your wa~ys; to
ponder thre paths of' your f~ee ; to remember
your Creator iu the da~ys of your youth. He
hlath decreed, that they only wrohofeth as-
t er ·rrydot~rte Jlall }'nd it , that fools J;Iall
be atFi~i~tde-ld, ecauf~ of thezir tran/grejions ;
and that whoso refufeth infruzltion, Pfall
defroy hisr owzen ful. By listening to these
admonitions, and tempering the vivacity
of youth with a proper-mixture of s~erious
thought, you ma~y .ensure cheerfulness for
the reft of life; Ibut by delive~ring your-

se~lves

selves up at prelent to giddiness and levi- 8 E i.
ty, you lay the foundation of lasting hea-
vinef~s of heart.

W~hen you look forward to those plans

of lifb, which either your circumitances
have fuggefied or your friends have pro-
posed, you will not hesitate to acknow-
ledge, that in order to p-ursu~e them ricth
advantage, some previous ditc-ip'ine is re-
quifite. Be aff2uced, tha t wha~tever is to
be your profefi'on, no- edujcation is more
necessary to your f~ucefis, than the ac-
quirement of virtuous difrpofitions and
habits. This is the uni~versal preparaties
for every charadter, and every flation in
life. Bad as the world is, refpedt is al-
ways paid to virtue. I-n the diual course
of hum~an.affairs, it will be found, that
a plain underflanding joined with ac-
knlowledged: worth, ·cont~ributes more to
prosperity, than the br1ightest parts with-
out probity or honour. Whether science,
or business, or public life, be your aim,
virtue flill enters, for a principal ,share,
into all those great departments of feeiety.

SERE It is connedit~ed writh emijnence, in every ii-

C ~J'Y~~beral art s, with reputaties, in every! branch

of fair and useful business~ j wmi~th diftinc-
tion,. in everyr public flat~ion. The vigour
wh~ich it gives the mied, and the weight
which it add~s to char~adter ; the g~ererous
featimnents. wh~ich. it brea~thes, the uzn-
dau-nted fpririt which· i~t inspires, the ar-
dour of diligence whic~h it quickens, the
freedom wh~ich it. procures from perni-
cious and· dishonora~ble avocat~ions, are
the foundations of all that is· high in fame,
or great in iAuccers, among men.

Wnihatever orna~ment~al or engaging en-

dow~ments you now posse~s·, virtue is a
necessary reqjuifite, In order to their thin-
ing with proper luffre. Feeble are the
attraftions of the fazireft· form-, if ite be

able

able difpoitrions,.and the accomplishments S E M.
of the mind. These are the quahities cc
w-hole influence will last, when the luff~re
of all that once [parkled and dazzled has
passed away.

Let not then the fetafon of youth be

barren of improvements so essential to
your f`uture felicity and honour. Now is
the fIeed-time of life, and according to
whla you sow, you feanll reap. Y our cha-
rader is now, under Divine affifance, of
your own forming; your fate is, in some
meas~ure, put into your own hands. Your
nature is as yet pliant and soft·. Habits
hiave not established their dominion. Pre-
judices have not pre-occupied your un-
dierflanding. The world has not had time
to clont'radt and debaf'e your affeaions.
All your powers are more vigorous, dif-
embarrassed, and free, than they will be
at any future period. W~hatever impulse
you now give to your desires and paifions,
the direaion is likely to continue. It:
wrill for-m the chalnnel in which your life
is to run ; nay, it may determine its ever-

lasting

"F M. lasting iffee. Confider then the employ-

,,_, , ment of this important period, as the

'high·eft truss whic~h thall ever be com-
mitted to you; as, in a great meaifure,
decisive of your happiness, in time, and
in e~ternity. As in the s~uccession of the
seasons, each, by the invariable laws of
Nature, afFeAs the produaions of what is
next in course; so, in human life, every
period ors our age, according as it i~s' well
or ill spent, influences the happines~s of
that which is to follow. Virtuous yo~uth
gradually brings forward accomplithed and
fljourifhing manhood; and fiuch man-
hood passes of itfo~lf without uneafinef*,
into rrelpedable and tranquil old age.
]But whe~n Nalture is turned out of its
regular course, disorder takes place in t~he
moral, just as in the vegetable world. I~f
the Spring put forth no b~lossoms, ins
S3umme.r there will ·be no beau ty,
aind in Autumn no fruit. So, if youth
be trified away without. improvement,
manhood will be contemptible,and old age
msifeirable. If the beginnings of life have

b~een

been *vanity, its latter end can be no aga~er 8 E XM.
than vexation of spirit.

Having thus thown the importance of

beginning early to give serious attention to
condu£1, I come, next, to point out the
virtues which are most necessary to be cudl-
tivated in youth. What I hall,

I. RECOMMEN D, is piety to God. With

this I begin, both as the foundation of
good morals, and as a difpolition parti-
cularly gracefid and becoming in youth.
To be voi of

- it, argues a, cold heart, defti-

tute of fomne of the best affe~tions which
belong to that age. Youth is the f'eafon
of warm and generous emotions. The
heart thould then spontaneously, rife
into the admiration of wchat is great,
glow w2ith the love of what is fair and
excellent, and melt at the discovery of
tenderness and goodneis. Where can any
objea be found, io proper to kindle thoer
affeaions, as the Father of the univers~e,
aInd the Author of all felicity ?Un-
moved by venecration, can y~ou contem-

plate

SER M. plale that grandeur and mrajefty, whiaR
,~Y his works every where display? Unltouch.

ed by gratitude, can you v iew that
profusion of goord, which, in this pleaC
ing season of life, his beneficent hand
pours aroun~d you ? Happy' in the love
and affeflion of those with wlhoma you
are conneited, look up to the Supreme
Being, as the infpiter of all the friend-
thip which has ever been thewvn yiou by
others; hiimfelf, you3r best and your first
ifriend,; formerly, the fuppjorter of your
infancy, and· the guide of your child-
hoosd now, the guardian of your youth,
sand the hope of your conung years.
View rel~igious hiomage, as a natural ex-
prefiron of gratitude to h'im for all his
g~oodneis. Confider it as the s~ervice of
the God of yor rfathers; 6f him, to whom
your parents devoted y-ou ; of him wihom
in former ages your anceffors honloure-d;
and by who~m they are now rewarded, and
blessed in heaven. C'orine61ed with so
many tender sensibilities of foul, let re-
!igion be with you, not the cold and

barret:

barren offspringJ of ipeculaPtion, but the S EX M.
warm and vigorous didate of the heart. J

But though piety chietly belong to the

heart, yet the aid of the underitanding is
requisite, to give a proper direaion to the
devout affe~tions. You must endeavour,
therefore, to acquire juff views both of
the great principles of natural religion,
and of the peculiar domrines of the gof-
pel. For this end, fludy the sacred scrip-
tures. Consult the word of God, more
than thne fyfitems of men, if you would
know the truth in its native purity.
When, upon rational and sober enquiry,
you have efiablifhed your principles, sus-
for them not to be thaken, by the fcooffs
of the licentious, or the cavils of the fecep-
tical. Remember, th~at in the examination
of every great and comprehensive plan,
such as that of Christianity, difficulties
may be expeaed to occur; and that
reasonable evidence is not to be rejeLaed,
becauSe the nature of our present slate al-
lows us only to knowe in part, and to fee
throughA a gla/s daErkly.

Imaprefs

8 EdM. Impress your minds with reverence for

s~v"J all that is sacred. Let no wa~ntonnels of

youthful spirits, · no compliance with the
intemperate mirth of others, ever betray
you Into profane sallies. Besides the guilt
which is thereby incurred, nothing gives
a more odious appearance of petulance
and presumption to youth, than the
affellation of treating religion with levi-
ty. Instead of being an evidence of f~upe-
rior underfianding, it: discovers a pert
and thallowy mind; wYhich vain of the
frirt fmatt'erings of knowledge, pres~umes
to make light of what the reft of man-
kind revere.

At the fame time you are not to ima.

gine, that when exhorted to be religious,
you are called upon, to become more for-
mal and solemn in your manners than
others of the fame years, or to ereft your-
s~elves into s~upercilious reprovers of thof'e
around you. The [pirit of true religion
breathes gentleness and affability. It
gives a native, unaff~elted ease to the be-
haviour. It is facial, kind, and cheer-

ful :

fult: far removed from that gloomy a~ind ~SER M.
illiberal s~uperstition -which clouds the
brow, tharpens th~e temper, dejeats
the s~pirit, and teaches men to fit them-
selves for another world, by negleding the
concerns of this. Let your religion, on
the contrary, connedi preparation for hea-
ven, with an honourable ~dis~charge of the
duties of ad~ive life. Let it be affociat-
ed in your imagination, with all that is
manly and ofeful; cr wth wphatfoever things
are trueP, arejuJ3, are pure, are lovely, aire
of good repor~t, wherever there is any uir-
tue, and wherever there is any praise. Of
su~ch religion dis~cover, on every proper
occasion, that you are not ashamed; but
avoid making any unnecessary oftentationm,
of it b~efore the world.

II. To piety, join modesty and docili-

ty, reverence of your parents, and s~ub-
mifllon to those who are your s~uperiors
in knowledge, in flation, and in years.
Dependence and obedience belong to
youth. Modefly is one of its chief orna-

rnents;

8 ER M. ments- ; a~nd has ever been esteemed a pre-

~ifL, thge of rising merit. Whe~n entering on

the career of life, it is your part not to
assume the reins as yet irito your hands,
but; to commit yourselves to the guidance
of the more experienced, and to become
waife by the wifidom of those who havet
gonle before youn.

Of all the follies incide~nt to youth,

there ar~e none whiich either deform its
pres~ent appearance, or blast~ the profped
of its future prosperi3ty, more than sel&f
conceit, prefumnption, and obitinacy. By·
checkxing its. natural prog~refi~ in improve-
ment, they; fix it in long immaturityi
and freqluently produce mifchicfs, which
can never be repaired. Yet these are
vices too commonly found among the
yo~ung. Big with enterpris~e, and elated by
hope, they resolve to trust for success to
none but themselves. Full of their own
a bili ties, they deride the adrnonitions whichl
are given them by their friends, as the
timorous suggestions of age. Too wife

III. JIr is necessary to recommend to you

sincerity and truthz. This is the basis of
everyv virtue.: That: darkness of charac-
ter, where ·we can. f-ee. no heart; e hose
foldings ·of art, through which no native
a~ffe~ion -is allowed to penetrate, present an

but particuairly odious in youth. If, at
an age wrhen the heart is warm, when the
·emostons are firong, .an-d when nature
is expedted· to show itself free: and open,
you can already finile and deceive, whbat
are we to look for when you thall be lon-

ger

ger hackneyed in the ways of men; when SE ~M.
interest thall have completed the obdura- J
tion of your heart, and experience shall
have improved you in all the arts of guile ?
Difir~mulation in youth, is the fore-runner
of perfidy in old age. Its first appearance,
is the fatal ornen of growiing depravity, and
future thame. It degrades parts and learn-
ing; obs~cures the luffre of every accom-
plifhment , and sinks you into contempt
wr~ith God, and man.

As you value, therefore, the appro-

bation of Heaven, or the· efleem of the
wrorld, cultivate the love of truth. In all
your proceedings, be diredt and consistent.
Ingenuity and candour pofrefs the most
powerful charm; they bespeak universal
favour, and carry an apology for almost
every failing. cl'e hp of' truth, shall be
eflabhf~hed for ever ; but a lying tongue, is
but for a moment*. The path of truth, is a
plain and a sa~fe path a that of fals~ehood,
is a perplexing maze. After the first de-
parture from sincerity, it is not in your

ness be found. Engrave onyour mind
that fCacred rule, of doing in all things ito
others according as you Iloryh th6at they jhould
do unfto YOu. For this end,imprefs yourselves
with a deep sease of~ the original, and
natural, equality of men. Whatever ad-
vantages of birth -and fortune you possess,
never display them with an ostentatious
fiuperiority. L~eave the f~ubordiinations of
.rank, to regulate thne intercourse~ of more
advanced years. At present,· it becomes
you to aaf among your companions, as
man with man. Remem~ber how unknown
to you are the vicissitudes of the world;
and how often they, on whom ignorant
and contemptuous young men once look-
ed down with ficorn, have risen to be their
s~uperiors in future years.

Compafflon is: an emotion, of which

you ought: never to be aihamed. Gra ce-
ful in youth is the tear of iympathy, and
the :heart· that: melts at the tale of woe.
Let not ease and indulgence contradt your

afFeaions,

sffeLdians, and wrap you up in felfith en- S~E ~M
joyment. But go sometimes to the house ~v
of mourning, as well as to the bIoufe of seas -
ing. Accuffom yourselves to think of the
diff resses of human life s of the solitary
cottage, the dying parent, and the weep-
ing orphan. 'I'ou J/salt not harden thy
heart, norjut: ~thy hand from thy poor bro-

not be grievued soben thou give/2 unto him 4;

i . 1wh~ich thous~ands, from race to race, conti-

nue to plit. The love of pleasure, na-
tural to man in every period of his life,
glows at this age with exceflive ardour.
Novelty adds freth charms, as yet, to eve-
ry gratification. The world appears to
spread a continual feast; and health, vi-
gour, and high spirits, invite them to
partake of it without refitraint. I n vain
we warn them of laterrt dangers. Religi-
on is accused of infufferable s~everity, in
prohi biting' enjoyment ; and the old, when
they offer their admonitions, are up-
braided with having forgot that they
once wvere young.-And yet, my friends,
to what do the refitraints of religion, and
the counsels of age, with refpeat to plea-
s~ure, amount ? They may all be con-.
prifed in few words, not to hurt your-
selves, and not to hurt others, by your
pursuit of pleasure. Within there bounds,
pleasure is lawful , beyond themm it be-
comes criminal, because it is ruinous.
Are there reflraints any other, than what

a wi [c

awife man would choose to impdie on sE RM.
Ihimfelfl ? e call you not to renounce s..--...
pleasure but to enjoy it in safety. Inflead
of abridging it, we exhort you to pursue
it on an extensive plan. We propos~e
measures for securing its poffefiron, and~
for prolonging its duration.

Consult your whole nature.. Confider

yourfCelves not only as s~ensitive, but as ra-
tional beings , not only as rational, but
social; not only as social, but immortal.
Whatever violates your nature in any of
there refpeats, cannot atford true pleas~ure;
any more than that which undermines an
essential part -of the vital system, can pro-
mote health. For the truth of this conclu-
sion, we appeal not merely to the authori-
ty of religion, not to the teffimony of the
aged, but to yourselves and your own ex-
perience. We ask, Wlhether you have not
found, that in a course- of criminal ex-
cess, your pleasure was more than com-
penfated by succeeding pain ? Whe-

8 ERM.i VI. DILIGENCE, induffry, and proper

21 mprovement of ,time, are material'duties
of the young. To no purpos~e are they
endowed with the best abilities, if they
want adivity for exerting them. Unavail-
ing, in this cafe, will be every direation
that can be given them, either for their
temporal or s~piritual welfare. In youth
the habits` of induffryt are moil esrly
acquired. In youth the incentives to it
are firorigeft, from ambition and from
duty, from emulation aind hope, from all
the profpeats which the beginning of
life affords. If, dead to ther~e calls,· you.
already languith in slothful inadtion, what
will be able to quicken the mo~re fluggiif
current of advancing years ?

Induff ry -is .not only the infirurnent

of improvement, but the fo~indation of
pleasure. Nothing is fb opposite tothe
true enjoyment of life, as' the relaxed
and fe'eble slate of an indolent mind.
Hre who is a firanger to hirduffry, may ,
poffers~, but he cannot enjoy. For it is

labour

labour only which gives the rel~ish to plea- SE AM.x
s~ure. It is the appointed vehicle of eve- cv
ry good^- to man. It is the inldif~penfa-
ble condition of our poffeffing a fouind
mind ihi· a found body. Sloth is so in-
con~iftent with both, that it is hard to
determine whether it be a greater foe to
virtue, or to health and happines~s. - In-
adtive as it is. in its~elf, its effe~ts are
fatally powerfi2L Though it appea~r a
slowly flowing fiream, yet it undermiries
all that is stable and flourithing. It not
only saps the foundation of every virtue,
but pours upon you a deluge of crimes
and evils. It is like water which first
putrifies by flagnation ; and then sends up
noxious vapours, and fills the atmo-
sphere with death.

Fly, therefore, from idleness as the

certain parent both of guilt and of ruiri.
And under idleness I include, not mere
inaltion only, · buit all that circle of tri-
fling occupations in which too irnany
saunter away- their youth; perpetuallyT

But though your train of life thould not C3h
lead you to fludy, the course: of educa-
tion always furniihes proper employments
to a well disposed mind. WShatever you
purs~ue, be emulous to excel. Generous
ambition, and sensibility to praise, are, es-
pecially at your age, amon~g the marks Of
virtue. Think not that any afflsence f
f~ortune, or any elevation of rank, exempts
you from the duties of application and
induffry. lIndu~ffy is the law of our b~e-
ing; it is the demand of Nature, of
Reason, and of God. Remember always
that the years which now pass ovter your
heads, leave permanent memorials-behind
them. From your thoughtles~s minds' they
may efeape; but they remain in the re-
membrance of God. They form an im-
portant part of the regjiter of your life.
They wcill hereafter bear testimony either
for or against you, at that: day, when, for
all your a~tions, but particularly for the:
employments of youth, you must give an
account to God.

VOL. r. 7TP1HUS

SER M. Tovs I have set before you, forne of

XI. ,1·r the chief qual'ifications which belong to

that Jober mind, that virtuous and religi-
ous charader, which the apostle in my
Text recommends to youth; piety, mo,
defly, truth, benevolence, temperance,
and induffry. ~Whether your future
course is deflined to be long or thort, after
'this manner i~t thould commence s and, if
it continue to be thus c6onduraed, its con-
clufion, at what time soever it arrives, will
not be inglorious or unhappy. For, bo·
nourable age is not that whBich f/andeth inl
length of time, or that wrehich is measured
by .number of years. But wroifdom is th
gray hair- to man, and an un/potted ife i
old a~ge.

LETI me finish the fubjea, with recall-

ing your attention to that dependence on
the blessing of Hieaven, wyhich, amidflt all
your endeavours after improvement, you
ought continually to pres~erve. It iStoo
common wyith the young, even when they
refoilvle to tread the path of vir~tue ana

honour!

honour, to set out wvith presumptuous con- SER 3M.
fidence inthemfelves. Trussing to their .
own abilities for carrying them fi~ccef~sful-
ly through life, they are careless of ap-
plying to God, or of deriving any assist-
ance from what they; are apt to reckon
the gloomy discipline of religion. Alas!
holy lit tie~do they know the dangers which
await them ? N~either human wifdiom, nor
human virtue, unsupported by religion,
are equal for the trying situations which
often occur in life. By the thock of tempt-
ation, how frequently have the most vir-
tuous intenitions been overthrown? Un-
der th~e pre~ssure of disaster, how of'ten has
the greatest conflancy f~unk ? Evtery good
and every perse& gift i fj.ow above. Wil-
dom and virtue, as we~ll as riches, and bo-
nourr, come rciom God. Destitute of his fa-
vour, you are in no better situation, with
all your boasted- abilities,- than orphans
left to wrander in a trackles~s desert, with-
out any guide to condua? them, or any
shelter to cover them from the gathering
floirm. Co~rredt, then, this ill-founded ar-

the Redeermer of the world. By piety
and prayer, seek the proteaion of the God
of' heaven. I conclu~de with the s~olemn
tsords, iti 'which a great Prince delivered
his dying charge to his s~on; words, which
every young person ought~ to confider as
ad-dressed to himsel~f, and to engrave deep-
ly on his heart. Thou, Solomon, mIy son, know

m~ents, is the rule of our duty, in eve- ,I-
ry period of life. But as the light which
guides our Rteps, varies with the progres~s
of the day, so the rule of religious con-
duc' is diversified in its applicationi, by the
different itages of our present existence.
To every age, there belongs a diitindt pro-
priety of behaviour. There arises frorn ·it,
a7 series of duties peculiar to its~elf.

Of

S ER M.~ Of those which are incu mbent on youth,

SI have treated in the preceding discourse.
As we advance from youth to middle
age, a, new field of aaion opens, and a
different charader is required. T'heflow
of gay and impetuous spirits begins to
fixbfide. Life gradually assumes a graver
cast; the mind a more sedate and though~t-
ful tur-n. The attention is now trans-
ferred from pleas~ure to interest a that is,
to pleasure difflifed over a wider extent,
and measured by a larger feale. Former-
ly the enjoyment of the pres~ent moment
occupied the whole attention. Now, no
amcton terminates ultimately in its~elf, but,
refe-rs to some more diff ant aim. Wrealth
and power, the infiruments of lafling
gratification, are n~ow coveted rnore than
any single pleasure. Prud~ence and fore-
fight lay their plans. Jnudafiry carries on
-its patient efforts. ALdivity pushes for-
ward; address winds around. Here, an
enemy is to be overcome; there, a rivaI
to be displaced. Competitions warm; and
tehe firife of the world thiickens on every

fide,

fide, to guide men through this busy pe- 8 EXLM.
riod, without loss of integrity; to guard TJ
them against the temptations which arise
fromn mistaken, or interfering, interests s
to call them from worldly pursuits, to fe-
rious thoughts of their spiritual concerns,
is the great office of religion.

But as this includes, in a great measure,

the whole compass of moral duty; as the
general firain of religious exhortation is
addressed to thof'e -who are in this feafobn
of life s a delineation of the virtues, pro-
perly belonging to middle age, may ap-
pear unnecessary, and would lead us in-
to too wide a field. Let us therefore turn
our view to a bounded profpedt; and con-
template a period of life, the duties of
which are circulmferibed within narrow-
er limits. O~ld age is a flage of the hu-
man courf'e, which every one hopes to
reach; and therefore the consideration of
it interests us all. It is a period juffly
entitled to general refped. Even its fail-
ings ought to be touched with a gentle
hand; and though the petulant, and the

Vd'bl,

8 ER M. vain, may despise the boary head, yet the

--·wisest of mAen has affrerted inl the T~ext,that

when found in the wreay of rigthteouajnefs, it
is a crown ofglory. I thall, firit, off~er some
counsels, concernin~g the errors which are
most incident to the aged. Secondly, I
fball s~uggest the pecuiar duties they ought
to piradife; and, thirdly, p~oint out the
consolations they may enjoy.i

i. As the follies and vices of youth, are

chiefly derived from inexperience and
presumption ; so, almost all the errors of
age, may be traced up to the feebleteies
and difireffes peculiar to that time of life.
'Th-ough in every part of life, vexati-
ons occur, yet, in former years, either
bufiners or pleas~ure served to obliterate
their imprefiion, by supplying occupati-
on to the mind. Old age begins its. advan-
ces, with jifqualifying men for reljihing
the one, and for taking an adive part mn
the othe~r. While it withdraws their accuf-
tomed su~pports, it impos~es, at the fame
time, th~e additi~onal b~urden of growm~jg

infirmities.

infirmities. In the former flages of their SER IM.
journey, hope continued to flatter them cv
with many a fair and enticing profpeQh
But in proportion as old age increases,
those pleasing illusions vaniah. Life is
contrasted within a narrow and barren
circle. Year after year, fleals somewhat
away from their flore of comfort, deprives
them of some of their ancient friends,
blunts some of their powers of f~ienfation,
or incapacitates them for some func-
tion of life.

TPhough in the plan of Providence, it

is wifely ordered, that before we are call-
ed away from the world, our attach-
ment to it thould be gradually loosened;
though it be fit in itself, that as in the
day of human life, there is a morning and
a noon, so there thlould be an evening
also when the lengthening thadows thall
admroniih us of approaching night; yet
w~e have no reason to be surprised, if
they who are arrived at this dejelting
season, feel and lament the chang~e which!
t~hey fu~ffler. Th'-e complaints, th~erefore,

s f~RI' M-s the aged, thould meet with tenderness,

__.rather tharf cent~ure. The burden under

which they labour, ought to be viewed
with ijympathy, by those -who must bear
it in their turn, and who perhaps, here-
after may complain of: it as bitterly. At
the fatme time, the old thould confider,
that all the seasons of life have their fe-
veral trials allotted to them ; and that to
bear the infxrmities of age with becoming
patience is as much their duty, as it is
thfat of the young to resist the temptations
of youthful pleasure. By calmly endur-
Ing, for the ihort time that remains, what
Providence is pleared to inflift, they both
express a resignation most acceptable to
God, and recommend themselves to the
efleem and afifitance of all who are
around them.

But though the querulous temper im-

oulted to old age, is to be cornfidered as a
natural infirmrityr, rather than as a vice,
the famle apology cannot be made for that
peevish2 difguff- at the manners, and that

accompany declining years. Nothmng can
be more unjust, than to take offence at
others, on account of the'ir partaking of
pleasures, which it is past your time to en-
joy. By indulging this fretful temper,
you both aggravate the uneasiness of age,
and you alienate thos~e on whose atfeflion
much of your comfort depends. In order
to make the two lextremes of life unite in
amicable society, it is greatly to be withed,
that the young would look forward, and
confider that they thall one day be old 4
and that the old would look back, and re-
membering that they once were young,
make proper allowances for the temper
and the manners of youth.

But inficad of this, it: is too common

to find the aged at declared enmity with
the wihole fyfitem of preilent customs and
manners; perpetually complaining of the
growing depravity of the world, and of
the affonithing vices and foi~ies of the
rising generation. All things, according
to them, are rushin-g fast into ruin. D~e-

cency

5 ER M. cency and good order have become extina,

Sever since that happy dis~cipline, under

which they spent their youth, has passed
away.---Part, at least, of this dif-
pleasure, you may fairly impute to th~e
infirmity of age, which throws its own
gloom on every surrounding objed. Si-
milar lamentations wpere, in the days of
your youth, poured fbrth by your fathers;
and they who are now young, thall, when
it comes to their turn, inveigh, in the
like strain, against those whlo succeed
them. Great has been the corruption of
the world in every age. Sufficient ground
there is for. the complaints rnade by f~eri-
ous observers, at all times, of abounding
iniquity and folly. But though particu-
lar modes of vice prevail in one age, more
than in others, it does not follow, that
on that age all iniquity is accumulated.
it is the form, perhaps, more than the
quantity of corruption, which maktes the
diitindion. In thie worst of times, God

mtuc; neither maLke thysel~f over·-wire*. For-
mer follies pass away, and are forgotten.
Those which are pres~ent, firik~e obf~ierva-
tion, and tharpen c-edure. Had the de-
pravation of the world continued to in-
crease in proportion to those gloomy cal-
culations, which, for so many centuries
past, have effimated each race as worse
than the preceding; by this time, not one
ray of good sen~se, nor one spark of piety
and virtue, must have remained unextin-
guithed among mankind.

One of the vices of old age, which apI-

pears the most uanaccountable, is that co-
vetous attachment to worldly interest, with
which it is often charged. But this too
can naturally be deduced from the sense of
its feebleneifs and decay. In proportion as
the vigour both of body and mind declines,
timidity may be expe~ted to increase. With
anxious and fearful eye, the aged look for-

* Eccles. vii. Io, r6.

wrard·

SER .M* wards to the evils, which threaten them,

~; and to the changes which may befall.

H3ence, they are fametimes apt to over-
valu~e riches, as the infiru~ment of their
defence against- there dangers, and as the
most certain means of s~ecuring them a-
gainft solitude and difr-efpedt. But though
their apprehensions may juffify a cautious
frugality, they can by no means excule
a sordid avarice. It: is no less absurd,
than it is culpable, in the old, from the
dread of uncertain fu turity, to deny them-
selves the enjoyment of the pres~ent;
and to increas~e in anxiety about their
journey, in proportion as it draws nearer
to its close. There are more effeAual
methods of comroanding refpett from the
world, than the mere poffeiron of wealth.
Let them be charitable, and do good.
Let them mi~x beneficence to their friends,
with a cheerful enjoyment of the comr-
fbrts which befit their slate. They will
then receivre the returns of real refpeft
and love. Whereas, by- their riches.
they procure no~ more than pretended

demonfirations

demonfirations of regard; while their ill- SE RM.~i
judged partimony occaffons many secret .,I
wvithes for their death.

As increating years debilitate the bo-

dy, so they weaken the force, an~d dimi-
nifh the w~armth of the affe~ions. Chill-
ed by the hand of time, the heart loses
that tender sensibility, with which it once
entered into the concerns and s~orrows of
others. It is in truth, a merciful ap-
pointment of Providence, that as they
who fee many days, muff behold many
a fad feene, the impreflions of grief upon
their heart thould be blunted by being
often repeated; and that, in proportion
as their power of advancing the profpe-
rity of others decrealFes, their partici-
pation of the misfortunes of others·
thould also lessen. However, as in eve-
ry period of life, humanity and friend-
thip contribute tol happines~s, it is both
the duty and interest of the aged, to
cherith the remains of the kind affec-
tions; and from the days of former
years, to recall s~uch impreflions as may

tend

8 ER IV[ tend to s~often their hearts. Let thear
,.IjL not, from having f~uffered much in the

cours~e of their long pilgrimage, become
callous to the fiufferings of others. But,
remembering that they flill are men, kt
them fludy to keep their heart open to
th~e ~enf~e of human woe. Practised in
the ways of men, they are apt to 'be
fiufpicious of design and fraud i for the
knowledge, and the distrust of mankind,
too often go together. Let not, how-
ever, that wary caution, which is the
liuit of their experience, degenerate into
craft. Experience ought also to have
taught them, that amidit all the falsehood
of men, integrity is the best defence; and
thatI he who continueth to the end to wIpalk
uiprgh~tl, thall continue to realk surely.
Having thus offered some admonitions
concerning the errors most incident to
age· II proceed,

II. T'o point out thbe duties whilch pecu-

liarly belong to it.

The:

The first which I thall mention, is, a 8 ExdM.

timely retreat from the world. In every c
part of life, w~e are in hazard of being too
deeply immersed in its cares. ]But, during
its vigorous periods, the impulse of a~tive
fTpirit, the necessary business of our Rtation,
and the allowable endeavours to advance
our fortune by fair induffry, render it dif-
ficult to observe due moderation. In old
age, all the motives of eager pursuit dimi-
niah. The voice of nature then calls you
to leave to others the buffle and contest of
the world; and gradually to disengage
yours~elves from a burden which begins to
exceed yourfitrength. Having borne your
ihare of the heat and labour of the day, let
the evening of life be passed in the cool
and quiet thade. It is only in the th~ade,
that the virtues of old age can flourith.
There its duties are dik-harged· with most
A~ccess, and there, its comforts are en-
joyed with greatel1 f~atisfa~tion.

By the retreat of old age, however, I

do not mean a total ce~ssation from every

VO L. T. Aa worldiv

SER M* worldly employment. There isan error

- ,in this, as well as in the oppolite extreme.

Persons· who have been long harassed with
business and care, sometimes imragine, that
when life declines, they cannot make their
retirement from the world too complete.
But where t-hey expetated a delicious enjoy.
ment of leisure and eafei t~hey have often
found a melan-choly f'olit~ude. Few are able,
in any period of their dayrs, to bear a total
abitradion from the world. There remains
a vacancy which they cannot fill up.
Incapable of being always employed in
the exercis~es of religion, and often little
quaalified for the entertainments of the
understanding, theyT are in hazard of be-
commng a burden to themselves, and to
all with whom they are conneated. It
is, therefore, the duty of the aged, not to
much to withdraw entirely from worldly
business, as to contradt its circle; not tol
much to break off as to lQooen their
communication with aative life. Conti-
nluing that train of occupation to w'hich

they

they have been most accuffomed, let SER gIM.
them peurfue it with less intens~eness a re- c
laxing their efforts, as their powers de-
cl-in~e; retiring more and more, from
public obse~rvation, to dlomeltic feenes,
and- serious thoughts ; till as the decays
of life advance, the world tha~llof itself
withdraw to a greater difiance from· their
view a its obj~edts thall gradually yield·
their place to others of more importance;
a1nd its tu~mults shall foulnd in their ea~rs,
only like a noise which is heard fro~nt
afa r.

If it be the duty of the old, to· ret~reat

betimes from the fati-gue of worldly ease~,
it is flill miore incumbent onr themi to
quit the pursuit of such pl~easures as are
unsuitable to their years~. Cheerfulness,
in old age, is graceful. It is the natu-ral
concomitant: of virtue. But the cheer-·
fulnes~s of age is widely different from t~he-
levity ofyo~uth. M/Iany things are allow-·
able in that early period, which in man-
turer years, would deser~ve censure; but
whl-ich, in old age, become both ridiculous·

Aaz anad

sZIRM 1 ad criminal. By awkwardly affeating

c~ to imitate the manners,· and to mingle in

the vanities of the young, as the aged
depart from the dignity, so they forfeit
the privileges of gray hairs. But if, by
follies of this kind, they are degraded,
they are expofecd to much deeper blame,
by des~cending to vicious pleasure, and
continuing to hover round thofie sinful
gratifications to which they: were once
addicted. Amus~ement and relaxation the
aged require and may enjoy. But let
them confider ~well, that by every intem-
·perate indulgence-they accelerate decay;
instead of enlivening, they oppref~is, and
precipitate, their declining slate. Ease,
safety, and refpeAt, are the proper enjoy-
ments of age. Within these bounds let it
remain, and not vainly attempt to break
through that barrier, by which nature
has ifeparated the pleas~ures of youth,
from the comforts left to the concluding
years of life.

A material part of the duty of the

aged consists, in fludying to be useful

to the race who are to s~ucceed them. SE AsI.R
Here opens to them an extensive field ~
in which they may so employ themselves,
as considerably to advance the interest of
religion, and the happiners of mankind.
·To them it belongs, to impart to the
'young the fruit of their long experience;
to infiruLd them in the proper condudt,
and to warn them of the various danrgers,
of life; by wife counfetl to temper their:
precipitate ardour; and both by precept
and example, to form them to piety and
virtue.

It: is not by rigorous discipline and

unrelaxing austerity, that they can main-
tain an a~c~endant over youthful minds.
The confiraint which their presence will
impoke, and the averflon which thieir
manners wvill create, if the one be con-
ftantly aw;ful, andi the other severe, tend
to fruff rate the erffeft of all their Twifdomn.
They must assume the spirit of the com-
panion, and the fr-iend; and mix wiith
the authority of age, a proper degree of
indulgence to the manners of thec young.

Iniltead

8 EaR M Inflead of lessening the ref~pedt due to

Stheir years by such condescension, they

take the forest method to increas~e it. Old
age never ~appears with greater dignity
than when tempered by mildnels, and
enlivened with good humour, it aas as
the guide and the patron of youth. Reli-
gion difpllayred in such a charadter, firikes
the beholders, as at once amiable and
venerable. They revere its power, when
thtey fe-e it adding so much g~race to the
decays of nature, and thedding to pleasing
a luffre over the evening of life. The
young w~ith to tread in the fa~me (teps,
and to arrive at the clofre of their days
with equal honour. They listen with at-
tention to counsels, which are mingled
w~ith tenderness, and rendered refpedtable
b~y gray hairs. For· notwiithfltanding all
its presumption, youth naturally bends
before su~perior krnowvledge and yrears.
Aged wifdoom, when joined with acknow-
ledged virtue, exerts an authority over
the human mind, greater even than that
which arises from power an~d Ra2ction. It

COD'

can check the most forward, abitfh the s I'd M
most profligate, and ~strike with awe the
most gIddy and unthinking.

In the midst of their endeavours to be

dieful to others, let riot the aged forget
thos~e religious e-mployments, which their
own slate particularly requires. The first
of ther~e, is refledtiona on their psAf beha-
viour, with a view to discover the errors
which they have committed; and, as far
as remaining life allows, to apply them-
selves to repentance and amendme~nt.---
Long has the world bewildered you in its
maze, and imposed upon you by its arts.
The time is now comre, when this grFeat
seducer thould millead you no more.
From the calm flation at which you are
arrived, fequeffered from the crowd of
the deceiving and the deceived, review
your condua~, with the eye of Christians
and immortal beings. After all the tu-
mult of life is over, what now~ remains to
afford you solid fatisfadtion ? ]Have you
s~erved God with fidelity, and discharged
your part to your fellow-creatures with

mntegrit~y

SE K ii ntegrity and a good conscience Can

.,..you look forward, without terror, to

that day which is to dissolve your con-
ned~ion with this world, and to bring
you into the presence of him who rnade
you, in order to give account of your
ad ions ? -The retrof~pe £t of life is s~eldom
wholly unattended, by uneasines~s and
thame. Though to the godod and the
bad, it presents a very different scene;
yet, to all men, it recalls much guilt
incurred, and much time mifpent. It
too much res~embles the review which a
traveller takes from some eminence, of a
barren country, through which he has
passed, where the heath and the defart
form the chief profped ; diversified only
by a few scattered ipots of impedfed cul-
tivationr.

Turn then your thoughts to the: proper

methods of making your peace with God
through Jes~us Christ; and implore, from
Divine grace, that ntEw beart, and right
Spirit, which will fit you for a better
world. Let devotion fill up many of

those

those hours which are now vacant from SER M.,

XII,

wvorldly business and care. Let your as- ',
fed~ions dwell among divine and immor-
tal objeats. In silent and thoughtful me-
ditation, walk as on the thore of that vast·
ocean, upon which you are soon to em-
bark. Summon up all the confiderati-
ons, which thzould reconcile you to your
departure from life; and which may pre-
pare you for going through its last scene,
with firmness anld decency. Often let
your thanksgivings ascend to God, for
that watchful care with which he h~ath
hitherto conduated you, through the long
journey of life. Often let your praiy-
ers be heard, that in what remains ofE
your pilgrimage, he may not forsa~ke you;
and that, when you enter into the val-
ley of thJe JfradnoE of deathn, he may there
support you w·ith his faf$; and defend you
wIith his rod.-Atmidit fulch thoughts and
cares, let old age find you employed; be-
taking yourselves to a prudent and timely
retreat; disengaged both from the op-
preffive load of business, and from the

III. To su-ggest the consolations which

belong top old age, when thus founmdin the
wa~y of righteogne;.P~CS

I muff introduce themn with observing,

That nothing is more reasonable in its~elf,
than to submit patiently to thos~e infirmi-
ties of Nature, which are brouight on by
the increas~e of years. You knew before-
hand what you had to expe~t, when you
numbered the f~uccefirve Summers and
Winters which were path~g over your
heads. Old age did not attack you by-
ifurprjif,, nor was it forced upon you
against your choice. Often and earnest-
ly, did you w~ith to jee long gje, land many'

d4J J

d'ays. When arrived at the desired period, sE M.
have you any just caule to complamn, on
a ccou nt of enduring wha t the confititution
of our being imposes on all ? ~Did yon ex-
pe~t, that for your fake, Providence wras
to alter its eflablilihederder ? Thr-oughout
the whole vegetable, fendiibe and rational
world, whatever makes progress towards
maturity, as soon as it has passed that
point, begins to verge towards decay. It
is as natural for old age to be frail, as for
the corn to bend under the ripened ear,
or for the autumnal leaf to change its
hue. To -this law, all who wcent before
you, have su~bmitted, and all who thall
come after you, must yield. After they
have flourithed for a season, they thall
fade, like you, when the period of decline
arrives, and bow under the prefirute of

y:ears.

During the whole progress of the hu-

mdn course~, the principal materials of
our comfort and unealinefspie within our-
relves. Every age will prove burdensome,
to those who have no fund of happineijs

in

8 ER M. in their own breast. Preserve them, if you

_ . could, from all infirmity of frame ; beffow

upon them, if it were possible, perpetual
youth; still they would be restles~s and mi-
ferable, through the influence of ill-go-
verned pafliosns. It is not surprising, that
s~uch persons are peev6ish, and querulous,
when old. Unjustly they impute to their
timne of life, that misery with which their
vices and follies emnbitter every age.
Whereas, to good men, no period of life
is uns~upportable, because they draw their
chief happines~s from sources which are in-
dependent of age or time. Wifdorn, pie-
ty, and virtue, grow not old with our bo-
dies. They fuffer no decay from lengthof
days. To them only belongs unalterable
and unfading youth. T~hose thatbe plant--

amufled you. Your s~ensations are less 8 ER M.
quick than formerly; your days more ~
languiihing. But if you have quitted the
region of pleasure, in return, you possess
that of tranquillity and repose. If you are
firangers to the vivacity of enjoyment,
you are free, at the f~ame time, from the
pain of violent and often disappointed
desire. M~uch fatigue, much vexation, as
well as vanity, attend that turbulence of
life, in which the younger part of man-
kind are engaged. Amidst thos~e keen pur-
farits, and seeming pleafuares, for which
you envy them, often they feel their own
misery, and look forward with a wiihful
eye to the f'eafon of calmneifs and retreat.
For on all sides of human life, the ba-
lance of happinef's is adjusted with more
equality than at first appears ; and if old
age throws some new diffreffes into the
fecale, it lightens also the weight of others.
1Many patlions, which formerly diflurb-
ed your tranquillity, have now subsided.

If you have aceed your part, with in-

tegrity and honour, you are juffly entitked
to r~espell, a-nd you w-ill generally recei-ve
it. For ra-rely, or never, is old age con-
temned, unless whien, by vice or folly,·
it renders itfe~lfcontemptible. Though
length of time may have worn off s~uper-
ficial ornaments, yet, what old age loses

in grace, it often gains in dignity. The sEIRa
veneration as was before orbferved, which
gray hairs command, puts it in the power
of the aged, to maintain a very important:
place inhuman society. They are sofar
from being insignificant in the world, that
famities long held together by their autho-
rity, and societies accefftomed to be guided
by their couns~el, have freq~uently had
cause to regret their los~s, more than that of

c~J perate mirth is not extinguished by ad-

vanced years. The mild pleasures of do-
meftic life, flill cheer the heart.' The
entertainments of conversation, and social
intercourse, continue unimpaired. The
desire of knowledge is not abated by
the frailty of the body; and the leisure
of old age, affords many opportunities
for gratifying that desire. The ifphere of
lyour observation and refleAion, is to
much enlarged by long acquaintance with
the world, as to supply within itself, a
wide range of improving thought. To
recall the various revolutions which have
occurred since you began to adt your part
in life; to compare the charaders of past
and present times; to trace the handof Pro-
vidence, in all the incidents of your own
lot; to contemplate with thoughtful eye,
the s~uccessive new appearances which the
wuorld has a~ssumed around you, in govern-
ment, education, opinions, cuffoms, and

no less entertaining, than infiruative to

SER M. to the beginning of ~time s and exhibits
.XIII. mankind in their infant and rising slate,

It nhotvs' us humari ~manners in their pri-
miti~ve simplicity, before the arts of refine-
ment had polished the behaviour, or dif-
guised the charaders of men; when they
gave vent to their pafflons without diffi-
mulation, and [poke their sentiments
without reserve. Few great societies were,
as yet, formed on the earth. Men lived
in fecattered tribes. Trhe tranf~adions of
famiies made the chief materials of his-
tory: and they are related in this book,
with that beautiful simplicity, which in
the highest degree, both delights the ima-
gination, and affea~s the heart.

Of all the patriarchal h~ifories, that of

Joseph and his brethren is the most re-
markable, for the charad~ers of the a~tors,
the infirudive nature of the events, and
the surprising revolutions of wvorldly for-
tune. As far as relates to the Text, and
is necessary for explaining it, the story is
to the following purpofe.-J-_ofeph, the
youngest, except one of the sons of

Jacob,

Jacob, was diflinguifhed by his father SER M.I~
with finch mar~ks of peculiar: affeaion, as
excited the envy of histbrethren. Having
related to them, in the openners of his
heart, certain dreams which portended his
future advancement above them, their
jealodfy rose to such a height, that they
unnaturally conspired his deffrudion.
Seizing the opportunity of his being at
a distance from home, they first threw
him into a pit, and afterwards fold him
for a slave; imposing on their father, by
a false relation of his death. W~hen they
had thus gratified their refeatment, they
loft all remembrance of their crime. The
family of Jacob was rich and powerful;
and s~everal years passed away, during
which they lived in pros~perity without
being touched, as far as appears, with the
least remorse~ for the cruel deed wvhich~
they had committed.

.XI' ,Egypt, the most powerful monarch at

that time in the world. While he pof-
sessed this high dignity, a general famine
diffreffed all the neighbouring countries.
In Egypt alone, by means of his fore-
fight, and prudent adminiffration, plenty
itill reigned. Compelled to have recourse
to that kingdom for f'upply of food, the
brethren of Jofekph, upon this occasion,
appeared in his presence, and miade their
humble application to him, for liberty to
purchase corn; little f~uCRpeing the Go-
viernor of the land, before whom they
bowrred dowpn th~eir Jfaces to the earth, to be
him, whom, long ago, they had fold as a
slave to the Ifhmaelites. But Joseph no
sooner saw, than he knew his brethren;
and, at this un~expefled meeting, his
heart melted within him. Fraternal ten-
derners aros~e, in all its warmth; andi
totally effaced, from his generous breast,

From this infirudtive passage- of hiilo-

r-y, the following observations naturally

arie.I. That a sense of right and wrong
in conduA, or of moral good and evil,
belongs to humnannature. I1[.That it pro-
duces an apprehenflon of aerited punish-
ment, when we have committed evil.
III. That although this inward featiment
be flifled during the season of poroperity,
yet, in adversity, it will revive. And,
IV. That when it revives, it determines us
to confider every distress wrhich we f~uffer,
·from what cause soever it has arisen, as an
ad~ual in-fliation of punithment by Heaven.
The consideration of these particulars,
will lead us to a very serious view of the
nature of man, and of the government
of God.

Lr TrIER E belongs to human nature, a

sense of moral gnood andi evil, or a fa~-

culty:

culty which difti ngu ilhes right from wrong, S;ER M.
in adion and conduB. 'They said one to . ~·
another, We are irerily gui~lty.--In an age
when the law was not yet given, when no
external revelation of the divine will, fub~o-
sifted, except what had been handed down
among the Patriarchs from one genera-
tion to another; the brethren of Jof'eph
reafobned concerning their conduQ, upon
the fiame moral principles,and were as fecc-
ed by the fame feelings, of which we are
conscious at this day. Such sentiments
are coeval with humran nature ; for they
are the remains of a law, which was origi-
nally wrtitten in our beart. In the darkieft
regions of the earth, and among the rudest
tribes of men, a diftindtion has ever bbeen
made, between juff and unjuff, between a
duty and a crime. Throughout all the in-
tercourfe of human beings, there diftindti-
ons are supposed. They are the founda-
tion of the mutual truff,which the tranfac-
tions of life require ; nay, the very enter-
tainments of society conflantly appeal to
them. The hifterian, who fludies to mag-

by Nature, with some s~ense of duty, or
of moral obligation, they could reap no
benefit from revelation; they would re-
main incapable of all religion whatever.
For, in vain were a Cyitem of duty pre-
feribed to. them by the word of Go~d;
allegiance were in vain required towards
their Creator, or love and gratitude en-
joined towards theirr Redeemer; if,. pre-
vioufly, there was no principle ia their

gations of duty, of allegiance,: and of

,XII ~responding to such terms i nor any con-

v~idion, that, independently of fear or in-
terest, they were bound to regard, .either
him who made, or him who redeemed
them.-T~his, therefore, is to be· held as a
principle, fundamental to all religion, that
there is in human nature, an app~rovingor
condemning f'enfb of conduA;~ by means
of which, they weho have not the law, are a
lawu unto themselves k.~ They who, from a
miflaken zeal for the honou r of Divine re-
velatio~n, eithe-r deny thie exfifence, or vi-
lify the authority, of natural religion, are
not aware, that, by <lifllowing the sense
of obligation, they undermine the fo~unda-
tion on which revelation biuilds its power
of commanding the heart.

The T~ext leads us to observe, That one

prompts us to do good to others; but'r
with much- greater authority, it checks,
and condemns us, when we have done
thern injuries. This part of the human
conflitution des~erves to be remarked, as a
signal proof of the wisdom of its Author,
and of the gracious provision which he
has made for the welfare of mankind.
We are all committed, in some meafore,
to the care and affifiasnce of one another.
But our mutual influence reaches much
farthaer with refoeat to the evils, than
with refpea to the enjoyments, of thos~e
around us. To advance their prosperity,
is often beyond our ability; but to ini-
flif injuries, is almost always within our
power: And, at the· fame time, felf-in-
tereif very frequently tempts us to commit
them. With the utmost propriety, there-
fore we are t~o framed, that the inifluence
of the moral -principle thould be most

Amidst the di'itrers which the Patriarchs
f~uffered in Eg~ypt, had-only this fuggeition
occurred, " We' saw our brother begin-
"' ning to ·prosper, and we contributed not
" to hris advarncemnent," their minds would
have been more easily quieted. But, when
their refledtion was, Wte fawe bit anguiy

Th~arpeR edge. I pro~eed to observe,

II. TsA T our natural s~ense of right

and wrong, produces an ·apprehenfon of
merited puniahment when we have com-
mitted a crime. When it is employed in
thrveying the behaviour. of others, it dif'-
tinguilhes fomne a~tions, as laudable and
excellent; and disapproves of others, as
evil and b~ase. 1But when it is diretted
ulpon our own conded, it assumes a
h~igher office, and exercises the authority

of a judge. Mt is then properly term~ed, sE bt. vr
Confcienmp; and the fentimlents whichlr I
it awnakens, upon the pEerpe~tration of a

punithable, for the part which- he has all-~

ficience, the inspi-red writeris frequently
[~peak of it, in terms borrowed from the
awfrrl f~olemnities of judicial procedure;

It will be found, that in the language of
most nations, terms of the fa~me import

The sense of punithment merited, You

are further to observe,~ can never be fepa-
rated from the dread, that at some time
or other, punishment. thall be adually in-
flided. This dread ·is not confined to the
vengeance of man. For let the fnner's
evil deeds be ever so thoroughly conceal-
ed from the knowledge of the wrorld, his
inw.ard alarms are not quieted ·by that

consideration. Now punithment is the S EdR 1
sanction of a: law. Every law thuppofes
a rightfril su~perior : And therefore, when
conscience thilreatens punithment to fiiecret
crimes, it manifefily recognizes a furpreme
Gov~ernor, from whomr nothing is hidden.
The belief of our being accountable
to him, is what the most hardened
wickedness has never been able to era-
dic~ate. "It" is a belief which arises, not
merely from reasoning, but from internal
fi~ntiment. Conscience is felt to ad as
the delegate of an invisible Ruler; both
anticipating his sentence, and foreboding
its execution.

Hence arise thi terrors, which so of-

ten haunt guilt, and rife in proportion to
its atrocity. In the hiflory of all nati-
ons, the Tyrant and the Opprefibr, the
bloody and the flagitious, have been'ever
pointed out, as fearful, unquiet, and reft-
less; fubjea 'to alarms and apprehenflons
of an unaccountable kind. And s~urely,
to live under su~ch difqjuietude, from the
dread of merited punithment, is already

xI ments whichi humrin natirre can fliffer.

When the wortld threatens ris wi~Nth any

quarter, on wnhich we are expos~ed to its
attack. We rneafure orir own firength
wtith that of our adversary; and can take
precautions, either for makinig resistance,
or for contrivring~ e'icape. But when an
awoake~ned conscience places before the fin-
ner, the juii vengeance of the Almighty,
the profped~ is confbunding, because the
-danger is boundless. It is a dark unknown
wihich threatens him. The arm that is
firetched over him, he can neither fee nor
resist. On every fidej he dreads it; and
on every objea whi~ch furrourids him, he
looks with terror, because he is confcir
ous tlhat eirery· objeA can be employed
against him as an infirument of wrath.
INo wonder thiat the loneiome solitude,
or the midnight hour, thould firike him

LeL~~Sri'ty the operations of ·confdience are of-

ten furpended; and that adversity is the
s~eason which reflores them to their pro-
per force. At the time when crimes are
committed the mind is too much heated
bty pafflon, and engrossed by the objeat of
its pursuit, to be capable of proper reflec-
tion. After this tumult. of ijpirits has
su~bsided, if a train of new pafflons be at
hand to employ its adivity, or a fu~ccef~-
sion of pleafurable' obje £ts occur to en-
gage its attention, it may for a while re-
main, though not entirely free from in-
ward mis~givings, yet uncon~scious of the
degree of its guilt. Diflipated among the
amusements of life, the finner efeapes, in
s~ome meas~ure, from his own view. I~f he
refleats upon himself at all, the continu-
ance of prosperity s~eems to him a firong
justification of his condua. For it will
be f~ound., that 'in the hearts o~f all men,
there is a natural propensity to judge of
the favour of the Supreme Being, from
he course of external events.. When they

are

arse borne with a fmoothi gale along the E R1Y
fiream of life, and behold every thing ,IL
proceeding according to their w~ih, hard-
.ly can they be bjrought to believe, that
Providlence is their enemy. Basking in
the sun-shine of profperityr, they suppose
themfelvres ·to enjoy the in~ile of indlulgent
Heaven; and fondly bconclude, tha~t they
are on terms of frienidhip with all above,
and with alIl below. Easy they find it,
then, to ipread over the grossest~ crimes,
a· covering, thin, indeed, and flight, yet
fufficient to conceal them from a s~uper-
~ficial view.

Of this we have a very remarkable in-

stance in those brethren of Joseph, whole
hiiffory we now confider. Not only from
the silence of the inspired writer, we have
ground to believe that their remorse was
Rflfed, while their pros~perity remained;
but we are able two trace some of the pre-
tences, by which, during that period, they
quieted their minds. For when they
wvere contriving the deftrufion of Joseph,
we find Judah say~ing to his brethren,

Whtyk

them juffifying their crime, byt a fort of
pretended hiumanityr; and making light of
f~eing their brother for a slave, becad~e
they did not take away his life. How
_Ifrangely are the opinions of men altered,
by a change in their condi'tion I How di~ff-
rent is this flentiment of the Patriarchs,
·from that which they afterwards enter-

wprong their hearts wtith anguish ?

Am'I., fulness, and propriety,. of that -inter-

change of conditions, which takes place
in human life. By prosperity, God gives
s~cope to our pafirons, -and makes trial of
oiar djipolitions. By adversity, he revives
the serious principle within. Neither the
one, nor the other, could be borne entire
and unmixed. MIan, always prosperous,

we consult nothing but our ease, God 8 ExI:
attends to our ~p~iritual improvement..
When we seek what is- pleasing, he s~ends~
what is uieful. When, by drinking too
deep of worldly prosperity, we draw in a
secret poison, he mercifully infuses a me-
dicine, at the time that he troubles and
embitters the waters. It remains now; to
observe,

IV. TIArr whe~ ~conscience ~is tho-
roughly awakened, it determines the
finner; 'to confider every calamity which
he f~uffers, as a politive infliaion of pu-
nithment by Heaven. As it had before:
alarmed him with threatenings of Di-
vine dis~pleas~ure, it tells him, when he
falls under diff'refs, that the threatened
day of accotint is come. ~Affimions, on
some otcations, ri~e 'direAly aut of our
fins. Thus, diseases are brought on by'
intemperance; poverty springs from id~le-
ness; and d~isgrace, from pres~umption.
In such cafe~s, the punishment is fo'
closely conneaed with the crime, that

the appoinItment of 'P-rovidence, which
we now confier, eacahes ;farither than
this. ·God has Iframed us fob, that

When the brethren of Joseph, ·con~fined
in the Egy~ptian prison, were -bewailing
the diffrefs into which they had fallen,
there was no circumflances which pointed,
out .any relation between their pr~efeat
misfortune,~ anzd their fonrmer cruelty to
their brother. A lontg cours~e ofiyears had
intervened, during which they flourished
in wealth and sease. They were.now far
fr~om the s~cene of their crime.; in a so-
reign land, where they believed them-
selves utterly unknown, and where they

had

8 ER M. had done nothing to offend. But confci-
xmI. eince formed aconnedtion between events,

which accordmng to the ordinary appre-
henfion of men, were entirely indepen-
dent of each other.: It made them recol-
ledt, that they, who once had been deaf
to the iApplications of a brother, were
now left. friendleifs and forlorn, imploring
pity in vain from an unrelenting Gover-
nor, and that they who had first con-
spired to kill their brother, and afterwards
fold him for a slave, were thems~elves de-
prived of liberty, a~nd threatened with an
ignominious death. How undef~ervedly
soever there evils befell them on -the part
of men, they confeffed them to be juif:on
the part of Providence. They concluded
the hour of retribution to be arrived; and
in the person of the Governor of Egypt,
they beheld the Ruler of the world calling
them to account for guilt. ~Therefore is
tibs afirue/s come upon uds. Behold als hits
blood is reg air ed.

Similar

-SimilaC sentiments, on like occasions, *~~I~I
will be found not uncommon among w-J
mankind. Pious men, the're is no doubt,
are at all times dif'pofed to look up to
God, ·and to acknowledge his hand .in
every event of life. B ut what I now
observe, is, That where no habitual ac-
knowledgment of God takes place a nay,
where a daring contempt of his ·autho-
rity has prevailed, cons~cience, -neverthe-
less, confirains men, in the day of their
diffrefs, to recognize God, under the most
awful of all charaders, The avenger of
past guilt.

Herein the wisdom of God appears

in such a light, as juffly to claim our
high~eftadmiration. Thle ordinary course
of his Providence, is carried on by hu-
man means. He has ~fettled a train of
events, which proceed in a regular s~ue-
cession of camufes and effeats, without his
appearing to interpos~e, or to adt. But
these, on proper occasions, are made to
affeac the human mind, in the fame
manner as if he w~ere beheld descend-

XrI.I with his own hand. Were God to sus-

pend the laws of Nature, on occaflon of
cevery great crime that was committed on
earth, and to govern the world by fre-
quent interpolitions of a miraculous kind,
the whole order of human affairs would
be unhinged a no' plains of aation could
be formed; and no sc~ope would be gi-
ven for the probation and trial of men.
On the other hand, were the operation
of s~econd causes allowed to conceal a
Divine hand totally from viewr, all sense
of f'uperior government would be loft;
the worl~d would s~eem to be void of God;
the finner would perceive nothing but
chance and fortune, in the diffreires
which he fuffered. Whereas by its be-
ing so ordered, that s~everal incidents
of life, thall carry the f~iame force, and
strike the mind with the fame impref'-
1100, as if they were supernatural
interpofitions, the fear of God is kept
alive among men, and the order of hu-
man affhijrs is, at the f~ame time, pre-

s~erved

fierved unbroken. The Einaer fees his 8 ER M.

lider it as· a Diivine judgment. His con-
foience gives to an ordinary misfortune,
sitl the ·edge and the fling of a visitation
from -HGeaven.

FRO omthe train of thought which the

Text has su~ggested, several inferences na-
turally followv. But I thall confine my-
~self to two, which claim you~r particular
attenition.

The first Is, the clear e~vidence whichdb

the preceding obfiervations afford, of a
Divine government now exrercifed over
mank~ind. This mroft important and aw-
ful of' all truths, cannot ~be too often pre-
seated to our -view, or too firongly im-
pressed on our mind. To the .imperfeA
conviAlon of it, which obtains in the
world, must be afecribed, in a great mea-
sure, the prevalence of: fin. Didt men
firmly believe, that the Almighty Being,

DZ~d whp

SER M. who formed them, is carrying on a fyftemn

Xm.I. of adminiffration which will not leave

guilt unpuniihed, it is impoilible that
·they could remain to inattentive, as we
often behold them, to their moral con-
dua. But the bulk of mankind are gid-
dy and thoughtless. Struck by the f~u-
perficial appearances of pleasure, which
accompany licentious~ness, they enquire no
farther; and deliver themselves up to
their ifenfes, and their passions. Where-
as, were they to refied,; but for a mo-
ment, upon that view which has now
been given of human nature, they might
soon be satisfied, that the moral govern-
ment of God, is no matter of doubtful
difouff~ion. It is a fadt, no les~s obvious
and inconteflable, than the government
exercis~ed by those earthly rulers, whom
we behold with the enligns of their office
before our eyes.

To govern, is to require a certamn

course of a~tion, or, to preferibe a law s
and to enforce that law, by a fauitable
diffribution of rewards and punithments.

N~ow,

Now, God has not only invelted confci- SER M.

. ~X II.

ence, as we have seen with autho-rity
to promulgate, but endowed it also with
power to enforce, his law. By placing in-
ward approbation and peace on the fide
of virtue, he gave it the fan~tion of re-
ward. But this was not enough. Pain
is a more powerful principle, than plea-
s~ure. To 'ercape misery, is a fironger
motive for a~tion, than to obtain good.
God, therefore, to framed human nature,
that the painful fienfe of ill-defert thould
attend the commifflon of crimes; t~hat
this sense of ill-defert thould necessarily
produce the dread of punith~ment:; and
that this dread thould to operate on the
mind, in the time of distress, as to make
the finner conceive: Providence to be en-
gaged against him, and to be concerned
in infit~ting the punithment which he
fuffers.. . All there imprefirons he hath
flamped upon the heart with his own
hand. He hath made them- coitrit~iuent
parts of our frame; on purpore, that by
the union of so malny firong and pungent·

sentiments,

atIt st. sentiments, he mig~ht enforce repentance

XxxI. ard reformation, and publiah to the hu-

man race his detestation of fin. 'Were he
to speak to us from the clouds, his voice
could not be more decisive. Wrhat we
dlifcern to be interwoven with the con-
te~xture of humnan nature, and to pervade
the whole cour'fe of human affairs, carries
artevidence not tobe resifted. We might
with as much reason, doubt wvhether the
f~un was intended to enlighten the earth,
dr the rain, to fertilize it; as whether he
who thus framed the humrian mind, intend-
ed to renounce righteousness to man~kind,
as his law.

THe E econd inference which I make

from the foreg~oing dis~course, refpeats the
intimate connedtion, which those opera-
tions of conscience have, with~ the pecu-
liar and diftinguithing doArines of the
Goipel of Christ. They will be found to
accord with them so remarkably, as to
f~urnith an anfwver to some of those o'b-
jedtions, which s~uperficial reafoners are

apt

apt to raise against the Chriffian revela- SE ~IV.
tion. In -particular, they comncide with ._,
that awful view which the Golpel gives
us, of the future consequences of guilt.
If the finner is now confirained by con-
s~cience, to view the Almighty as purf~u-
ing, him with evil for long-forgotten cri mes,
how naturally must he conclude, that,
in a s~ubsequent period of existence, the
Divine adminification will proceed up-
on the fame plan, and complete what
has been left imperfeet here ?~ If, during
this life, which is only the time of trial,
the displeasure of Providence at fin is
displayed by tokens to manifest, what
may be .apprehended to follow, when-
juffice, which at pres~ent only begins to
be executed, thats be carried to its con-
f~ummnationi ? What confcien~e forb~odes,
revelation verifies; assuring us, that a
day is appointed, when God will render
to every m~tan accordning to ris wzorks ; to
themn, who~t~ by patient contirnuance in eed/l-
doinrg, seek for glory, bonour, and immor~ta-
!lity , eternal lIfe > Buct unto them that ares

While the thr~eatenings of conscience

thus firengthen the evidence of the ferip-
tur-e doatrtine concerning future punish.
nI~ents, they likewise pave the way for the
belief of what is revealed ·concerning the·
method of our deliverance by Christ.
They suggest to the finner, some deep
and dark mnalignity contained in guilt,
which has drawn upon his head such high
displeasure from Heaven. They call forth
his most: anxious efforts, to avert the es-
feats of that displeasu~re, and tb propiti-
ate his offended judge. Some atonement,
9he is cons~cious, muff be made; and the

demanded fuffering, as the proper atone-

xly ha~~. JO Y and Fear, are twso great [prings of

human a~thon. The anuxed condition of
this world, givres scope for both; and,
according as the one or the other pre-
dominates, it influences the general te-
nour of our condu~t. Each of them
poffeffes a proper place in religion. To
fervue the Lord weith gl~adness, is the ex-
hortation of the PfCalmift D7avid *. To
fervea him weith reverence andta god~ly fear,
is the admonition of the Apofile Paul J.
But, under the present imperfe~tion of

" Pfal. c. 2. +t H~eb. xii. 28.

hum~an

human nature, each of these principles SBERM.
may. be carried to a dangerous extreme.
When the whole of~ religion is placed in
joy, it is in hazlard of rising into unawar-
rantable rapture. WMhen it rests altoge-
ther on fear, it degenerates into f~uperfti-
tious servility. The Text enjoins a due
mixture of both J and inculcates this im-
portant maxim, That joy, tempered with
fear, is the proper difpolition of a good
man. In dis~coursing of this f~ubjeat, I
thall endeavour to thow, firit, That joy
is es~sential to religion , and next, That,
for various reasons, this joy ought to be
mixed with fear; whence we shall be
able to afrcertain the nature of that fleady
and composed spirit, which is most suit-
able to our prefeat condition, and most
acceptable to God.

I. Jov is essential to religion, in two

re~peitas; as religion inspires joy, and as
it requires it. In other words, To rejoice,
is both~ the privilege, and the duty, of
good maen.

.axa . IJ ~the f irf I place, Reigion inspires joy.

3U~,It affords jaft ground of g-ladnes~s, to all

·who firmly believ~e its dearines, and fin-
cerely fledy to obey its laws : F;or it cone

site~s of jioy; a favourabic . ftuation of
things without,- and a proper difp~olition
of mind within, to relish that favourable
situation.

When thcy erramnine their situation

without, they behold themselves placed
in a wvorld, rwhich is full of the influ-
ence of a gracious Providence; where
beauty and good are every wvrhere predo-
mninant; ·where variou~s ceomfornts are be-
flowed; anld where if any be withheld,
they have reason ·to ~beieve, that they are
withh~eld by pa~rental wifdomn. Among
the crowd that encompass them, they
may be at a loss to discern, who are their
friends, and who their enemies. But
it is fuffcient to knsows that they are
under the protedtian of an invisible Gugar-
dian, whose power can keep them from

no account. But as long as they are f~a-
tisfied, that the tyfite~m of Divine govern--
Inent is founded oh mercy, no Fprefeant
occurrences are able to defiroy their peace.
For he wh~offared not his. owen Son, datl d-
rivered htim up for them, h~owe ~Fhll be not
with'f hcim freely givue them al ~things ?~ If
their nlature is frail, Divine afifntance is
promifedf to firengthen it. If their virtue
is impe~rfea, a dispensation is opened,
which gives them the hope of pardon. If
their external circumfitances be in any re-
Cped unfavourable, it is because a higher
interest is consulted. All things, they are
assured, Jhall woork tog~ether for their good.
On their prosperity reits, the blefirng a on
their adversity, the fanatifying Spirit of
the Almighty. Old age mity advance,
and life decay; but beyond those bound-
aries of Nature, faith opens the pr-o-
fpeQ of their lasting feli'city. Writhout
anxiety, they pass through the different
periods of their prerent existence, becaus~e

th ey

8 ER M. they know it to be no more: than an intro-

.'V~,duation to immortality.

As such a situation of things without,

lays a solid foundation for joy; T o the.
dis~position which religion forms within,
promotes the relish of it. It is indeed
from within, that the chief sources of en-
joyments or trouble rife. The m'inds of
bad men are always disorderly; and hence
their lives are to generally uneafyr. In
vain they take th5e timbrel and the harp,
and endeavour to rejoice at the founid of the
org~an. Spleen and difguff pursue them,
through all the haunts of amulement.
Pride a~nd ill humour torment them.
Oppress~ed with dis~content, their ifpirits
flag i and their worn-out pleasures as ford
them entertainment no· more. But reli-
gion subdues thos~e malignant pafflons,
which are the trou blers of human repos~e;
which either overcait the mind with the
gloom of peeviihnefs, or d~isquiet it by
the violence of agitation. It infuifes, in
their room, those mild and gentle difpofi-

candour, moderation and temrperance, ~
wherever they reign, produce cheerful-
ness and s~erenity. The confciouthefs of
integrity, gives ease and freedom to the
mind. It enables good men to extradt
from every objeA, the whole fatisfadion
which it is capable of yielding; and adds
the flavour of innocence, to all their ex-
ternal pleafuxres.

IN the s~econd place, As religion natu-

rally inspires joy; so what it inspires, it
commands us to cherith. As a necessary
proof of our sincerity, it requires cheer-
fulness in the performance of our duty;
because, if this be wanting, our religion
dis~covers itfelfE not to be genuine in prin-
ciple, and in pradtice it cannot be fla~ble.

Religious 'obedience, destitute of joy, is

not genuine in its principle. For did ei-
ther faith or hope, the love of God, or
the love of goodnes~s, rule the heart;
they could not fail to produce f~atisfadion
in piety and virtue. All those causes of

V o r;. T. Ee' joy

8 ER~ MjOY which I~ have mentioned, would then

·~~ operate i and their nai~tive effet oni the

mind, w~ould fo3~ow. The prcf~peats which
religion ope~ns, w~ould gladden·, and the as-
feations wh:ich it infi~ires, would feeoth· the
-heart. We se-rve, wBith pleasure, the be-
nefador whom we= love. We rejoice in
every fludcy aind perfitii, to; wGhich, wve are
sincerely attached. If we~ s~erve not God
with pleas~ure, it: is because we knowr him
not, or love him not. If we rejoice not
in virtue, it is because our affea~ion is
alienated foro it, an~d our inclinations are:
depraped. We give too evident pr~oof,
t~hat either we believe not the principles of
reli~gion, or that we feel not their power.
Exclude joy from religion; and you leave
no- other mnotives to it, except compul-
sion and: in~tereftP. But are there s~uitable
grounds, on which. tol ref1 the whole of
our obedience to the Supreme Being ?
M~y Son, give me th5y hearrt, is the call of
God. Surely if there be no pleas~ure in
.fi21filling his· commands, the heart is not

given

given him ; and, in that cafe, the multitude 8 EIR N{
of facryes, and burnt oer~ings, is brought
t~o his altar in vain.

As religion, ;destitute of joy, is imperfe £

in' its principle; so in prsa~tice, it muff be
u~nflabic. In· vain you endeavour to fix'
any man to the regular performance of
that, in which he finds no pleasure. Bind
him ever so fast by interest or fear, he will
contrive some method of eluding the obli·-
gation. Ingenuity is never so fertile of eva-
fions, as where p~leas~ure is all on the one
fide, and mere precept on the other. He
may fludy to save appearances. H~e may
d'iffemble and confirain himself. ~But his
heart revolts in -Secret; and the weight of
inclination wi-ll, .in the end, draw the
praatice after it. .If perseveran-ce is not
to be expe~ted, still les~s can zeal be lookedi
for, from him, who in his religious du-
ties, trembles without rejoicing. Every
attempt towards virtue which he forms,
wvill be feeble and awkward. He applies
to it as a taflks he dreads the talk-mafter;
but be wlill labour no more than neceffityr

8 ER M. enjoins. To es~cape from punishment, is

XI'.his sole aim. He bargains for immunity,

by every duty which he performs; and all
beyond, he esteems superfluous toil.---
Such, religion as this, can neither purify
the heart, nor prepare for heavenly blift.
It is the refuge of an abjeft mind.
It may form the ritual of the monk, or
prescribe the penance of the idolater a but
has no concern with the homage of .him,
who weorJjZios the F~ath3er in /pirit and in;
truth. His charadler is, that thejo~y of the
SLord is his frPength*. It attaches his heart
to religion. It ins~pires his zeal. It sup-
·ports his conflancy; and accelerates hisS
progrers.

There is no man, but has some objeft

to which he cleaves for enjoyment; s~ome-
what that flatters him with difiant hope,
or affords him present pleasure. Joy is
the end towards which all rational beings
tends. For the fake of it, they live i it
refi-iembles the air they breathe,~ which is
necessary for the motion of the heart, and!
all the vital fund'ions. But as the breathi-

ruptedr fource,is d~eftru cti ve, both of virtu e
and of true happines~s. When you have
no pleasure in goodnes~s, you may with
·certainty conclude the reason to be, that
your pleas~ure is all deri ved from a n opposite
quarter. YPou ha ve exhaufed your affec-
·tion upon the world. You have drunk
-too much of its poisoned waters, to have
any relish for a pure spiring.

your religious principles, effimate the de-
gree of your flability in religious pra~tice,
by the degree of your f~atisfa~tion in piety
and virtue. Be affi~red, that where your
treasure is, there will your delighit be also.

and which it requires, in goodm-men. But
in our present slate, the best principles may
be carried to a dangerous excess; and joy,
like other things, has its due limits. To
serve God with unmixed delight, belongs
to more advanced spirits in a happier
world. In this re~i-on of imperfeAion,
forne infusions from at d'ifferent cup, must
-of ne'ceffity tinalursc our joy. Let us

SER M. der it proper, that when we rejoice, we
xi~v. thould re'o~ice ieith trembling.

In the fi~rst place, because all the objefts

of religion, which afford ground for joy,
tend to inspire, at the famne time,- reve-
rence an~d fear, W~e se~rve a Benefa~tar,
it is true, in whom we have reason to de-
light awhofe purposes are gracious ;whos~e
law is the plan of our happinel~s. But this
Benefa£10r, is the K;~ing, eternal, imm~ortal,
and invi/ilej at whole presence, the
mountains thake, and INature trembl~es.
~Every good and every perfiErt gift, comte dowren
from him. But the hand which conf'ers
·them we cannot fee. Myfierious obfou-
rity refls upon his effnce. He dwelleth
in the secret place of thunder ; and clouds
and darkness~ ·surround .hi~m. He is the
Hea~rer of prayer ; but we lift our voice to
him from a~far. Into his immediate pre-
frence no access is permitted.. Our warme it
devotion admits no fami~liar~ity with him.
;God is in beaven, and throu uponz carth ,
therefor~e, let th" wIords be fewe. If his owni-
O~cience ad~minrifters comfort in our ~e~cret

diffreifs,

diffref~s, it like wif~e fills with ~awe~ the SER lif.
heart that is cons~cious of guilt. So, if he .XV
knowzes o~r frame, and remember-s ·we are du} s;
our iniq-uities, also, are ever before him a;
our feccretfins, in2 the I@~bt of his courntenance.

Throughout all his dif~penfations, great-

ness, in conjun £1ion with goodn~es~s, frikes
our vriew s and, wherever we behold the
Parent, we behold the Legislator also.
The death of Christ~, in behalf of a gu~ilty
world, is the chief ground of religious
hope and joy. Bunt it is no less the g!roun!IZd
·of reverence; when in this high tranf'ac-
tion, ~we contemplate God, as at once
firiLt in juffice, and great: in mercy. I
the Lord keep mervcy for thoulands ·of themr
tfhat fear me. 1 for give .their iniquity,
tran/grezion, aknd i~n; dut I wreill by no m7eans

·of the Law, we find promite~s and threat-
enings mingled in the fame page. On the
one fide, wye fee H~eaven displayed in all
its g~lory : On the other, Hlell opening its
terrors. In thort, in whatever lighat wte
v~iew religion, i-t appears folemnn and ve-

ne~ra ble.

15ER M. nlerab3lei It is a temple full of ~rajefty,

XV to which the worthippers' may approach

wyith comfort, in the hope of obtaining
grcace, and fnding~ mercy ; but where they
cannot enter, w~ithout being impreif2ed
with awe. If we may be permitted to
compare spiritual with natural things, re-
ligion resembles not there fe~enes of na-
tural beauty, where every obj~edt smiles.
It cannot be likened to the gay landscape,
or the flolwery field. It rese~mbles more
the august and sublime a ppearances of Na-
ture; the lofty mountain, the expanded
ocean, and the flarry firmament; at the
figh-t-of which, the mind is at once over-
awed and delighted; and from theuunion
of grandeur with beauty-, derives a pleas-
ing, but a serious, emotion.

IN the recond place, As joy, te~mpered'·

by~ fear, fixits the nature of religion, so
it is requiiite for the proper regulation of
the conduRt of man. Let his joy flow
from the best and purest fource;.yet, if it
remain long uanmixed, it is.apt to become

dangerous

dasngerous to virtue. As waters wh'ich are 8 E 10I.
never stirred, nor trodbled, gather a fedi- Ev.c~
ment, which putrifies them; so the undif-
turbed continuance of placid sensations
engenders disorders in the human foul.
It is wifely ordered in our prefeat slate,
that joy and fear, hope and grief, thould
a61 alternately, as checks and balances
upon each other, in order to prevent an
excess in any of thernr, which our nature
could not bear. If we were f~ubje61 to
no alarms of danger, the wisest would
soon become improvident; and the most
humble, pref~umptuou's. Mlan is a pil-
grim on earth. Were his path to be al-
ways ifmooth and flowery, he would be
tempted to relinquith his guide, and to
forget the purpofie of his journey. Can-
tion and fear are the thields of happiness.
Ulnguarded joy begets indolence; indo-
lence produtces f'ecurit-y; security leads to
rashness·; and rath~nefs ends in ruin. In
order to rejoice long, it is neceirary that
we rejoice spithL· tremnblzing. Had our first
parents obs~erved this rule, rnan might

have:

SER M. have been fs ill in paradise. He who faith

fall never be moveds may be afrured, that
his slate already begins to totter. R-eli-
gion, therefore, performs a kind office, in
giving us the admonition of the Text.
It inspires cheerfulness~ in the s~ervice of
God. It propoles joy, as our chief
spring of adion. But it supports joy, by
guarding it with fear; not s~uppressing,
but regulating its indulgence; requiring
us to rejoice, like persons who have
obtained a treasure, wr~hich through want
of vigilance, they are expos~ed to lose.
Dependent beings are formed for fu~bmif-
1100n; and to submit, is to stand in awe.
Be~caufJ the Lord reigneth, let th5e earthb
Ie glad. We are the f~ubjeas of God;
and therefore may juffly rejioice. But
itill we are fubjeats; and, thelrefore, trem-
bling muff mix itself writh our joy.

IN the third place, Thie unflable condi-

.tion of all human things, naturally inspires
f~ear in the midit of joy. The spirit to

whnich

which religion forms us, muff undoubted- S ER M.
ly corres~pond to the slate in which we are .I'
placed, and to the part which is assigned
us to adt. Now the firfit view under which
our present slate appears, is that of fallen
creatures, who are undergoing, in this
world probation and trial for their recove-
ry; and are commanded to ~work out th~eir-
salvation wreith fear and tremzbingi~. This
view of our condition infers not habitual
deje;Aion of rpjnd. It requires not melan-
choly abi~iradion from the affa-iris~ or total
contempt of the amusements, of life. But
it insp~ires humility. It enforces depend-
ence on Divine aid; and calls forth th~e
voice of fu~ppication to Heaven. In a si-
tuation to critical, and where interests so
-important are at a flake, every reas~onable
·person must confers, that fe~riodnhers ought
to temper rejoicing.

I HAVE How ihowan, in what refpease

religion both promotes joy, and: infipires
feriodfnefs, It places us in the moss fa-
voura~ble fitunation, which human- life a~s-
fords, for j~oy; and it gives us every assist-
ance, for relifhling that joy. It renders
it our dutyr, to cultivate the satisfaC~tion

wh~iich

SE R M which it yields. It demands a cheerful

xx.XV f iirit, in order to ascertain the sincerity

of our principles, and to confirm us in
good pradtice. At the fagme time, the joy
.which it inspires, is tempered with fear, by
the genius of religion jitfelf; by the dan-
gers to which unguarded joy would expole·
us; and by the impropriety of indulging
it, in a situation so mixed as the pres~ent.
The tremblingf which is here enjoined, is
not to be underflood as signifying a pufilla-
nimous dejedtion. It imports no more than
that caution and sobriety, wh~ich prudence
ditetates, as belonging; to our slate. By con-
neding sauch trembling with our joy, re-
ligion means to recommend to us, a cheer-
ful, but a compos~ed, ipirit, equally remote
from the h umiliating deprefflon of fear, and
the exulting levity of joy. Always to re-
joice, is to be a. fool. Always to tremble,
is to be a slave. It is a modest cheerful-
ner~s, a chastened joy, a manly fe~rioufner~s,
whic~h becomes the se~rvant of G~od.

·when it permits 12s to gratify every desire ;
and, in~ iet'urb for our f~urinountihg the ti-
morou~s foruples of conscience, promises
;us a li~fe of gaiety, f~estivity, and unre-
itrainedl joy ?-Such ptorbifes, vice may
ind'eed make a but, how far it fulfils them,
we may i'afely trfer to the d~etermination of
the greatest fenzfialift, wPhen he has fihnifh-
;ed hiis career, abd looks back on what he
has ienjoyed. Ask~ him, Whether he would

to hold the~ raie coi~irfie;· and wlhether,
with h is dylifg brea th, he dare afirure them,
that the gratifications of Ijieentioidnef~s
afford the greatest chjoy~ment of life ?
Whatever hope8 trice mayr at the begin-
ning ihfpire, yet, after the trial is made,
it has been always found, that criminal
pleasures are the bane of happinefCs; the

Vb L. L; Fs pioifoii

SER M. poison, not the cordial, of our prese~nt

xiv-. slate. They are pleasures, compensated

by an infinite overbalance of pain s mo-
ments of delight, s~ucceeded by years of
regret; purchased at the expence of in-
jured reputation, broken health, and ruin-
ed peace. Even aibfiradting from their
pernicious consequences, they are, for most
part, in themselves treacherous pleas~ures;
unsound and diflurbed in the mom~ents of
enjoy ment. In the mid} of fuchJ /aute; ,r
the he~art is/orrowful. Often is the fmnile
of gaiety assumed, while the heart akes
within: And though folly may laugh,
guilt will fling. Corredting this pernici-
ous phreonzy of pleasure, a nd redu cing i t to
a more sober a nd regula ted itate, religion is ,
in truth, no other than wisdom, introduc-
ing peace and order into the life of man.

While religion condemns s~uch pleasures

as are immoral, it is chargeable wYith no
improper aufferity, ihl refpedB of thlofb
which are of an innocent kind. Think
not, that by the cautious discipline wihich
it prefeiribes, it excludes yrou from all gay

enjoy ment

en oment of life. W~ithin the compass SER M.
of that sedate spirit, to which it forms ir
you, all that is innocently pleasing will be
~found to lie. It is a mistake to imagine,
that in conflant effidions of giddy mirth,
or in that flutter ors rpirits which is excit-
ed by a round of diverflons, the chief en-
joyment of our state consists. Were this
the cafe, the vain and the frivolous would
be on` better terms for happiness~, than. the
w~ife, the greslt, and the good. To ar-
range the plans of anideiment, or to pre-
fide in the haunts of jollity, w~rould be)
more defitable, thadn to exert the highest
effort of m~ental piowers for the beriefit of
nationis. A cons~equ~ence so ablird, is sus-
ficient to explode the principle froli tthich.
it flows. To the amde~ments and lesser
joys of the world, religion assigns theif
proper place. It admits of them, as relaxa-
tio~ns fromi car-e, as infiruments ~f promnot-
ing the union of men, and of erilivening
their s~ocial inter'courfe. But though, as,
long as they are kept within due bciunds,
it does not cedfure nor condemn them;

Fs 2 neither

8 ER M. neither does it propos~e them, as rewards

xIV.~ to the virtuous, or as the principal ob ieas

of their pursuit. To s~uch, it points out
nobler ends of a £ion. Their felicity it
eng~ages- them to ~seek, in the dis~charge of
an useful, an upright, and honourable
part in life; and, as the habituall tenour
of their mind, it promotes heerfulnefs,
and diiofocuraes levit~y.

Between there two there is a wide dif~

tin·ion ; and the ~initd which is mnoft openi
to levity, is frequentljr a firanger to cheer-
fulness. It has- beets re;mared, that tran-
sports of intemperate mirth, are often no
mlore than flashes from the dark clould;
and that, in pr~oportion to the violenice of
the effidrgence, is the fuicceedinig gloom.
ZLevityT tay be the forced produAion of;
folly or vice; cheerfulness is the natural~
of fspringof wis~dom and virtue only. The
one is an occaffonal agitation a the other,
a permanent habit. The onedegrades the
charadIer; the other is perfedly consistent
with the dignity of reason, and the fleady
and manly spirit of religion. To aim at a

con slant

conflant f~uccefflon of high and vivid f~en- SE R M.
[ations of pleasure, is an idea of happiness c
altogether chimericall. Calm and tempe-
rate enjoyment, is the utmofa that is allot-
ted to man. Beyond this, we firuggle in
vain to raise our slate; and, in ·fa~t, de-
pres~s our joys, by endeavouring to height-
en them. Inflead of those fallacious hopes
qs perpetual festivity, wvit-h which -the
wvorl would allure us, religion confers
upon u~s a cheserful tranquillity. Inficad
of dazzling u~s wi~th meteors of joy, which
sparkle and expire, it theds around us, a
calm and Ready ifght, By mixing trem~b-
ling with our joy, it renders that joy more
solid, more equal, and more lafiting.

In this f'pirit, then, lest us serve G~od,

and hold our course throughm life. Let us
approach to the Divine Being, as to a so-
vYereign of whom we fland inb awp,-" and to
a father in whom we truss. In ouir ~con-
duBt, let us be cautious and humble,
as those who have ground to fear a w~ll
pleased and cheerful, as those whlo ha ve
cause to rejoice. Let us show the world,

that

8 ER M. that a religious temper, is a temper, fe-
xly'. date, not fad; that a reli ious behaviour,

is a behaviour, regulated, not: fliff and
formal. Thus we· shall afe thse wsorld, als
not abu/ing it; we shall pass through its
.various changes, with the least2 dif~compo-
fuire; and we thall vindicate religion, from
th~e reproaches of those who would attri-
bute to it, either enthuiiaffic joys, or flay-
ifh terrors. We thall thow;, that it is a,
rational rule of life, worthy of the' per-

Is no wonder, that this s~pirit of restless-
nefCs and diffatisfaAion, which corrupts
every terreflrial enjoyment, thould have
sometimes penetrated into the region of
virtue. Good men are not wvithout their
frailties; and the perverfbneis incident to
hujman nature, too readily leads us, who
become weary of all other th~irgs, to be
weary, also, in? wcell-doing·.

Let me put a cafe, which perhaps, will

be found not unfrequent in ordinary life.
Suppole a person, after much 90mmerce
wvith the world, to be convinced of its
vranity. He has seen its mofr flattering
hopes to be fallacious. He has felt its
moss boasted pleafines to be ulnfatisfadto-
ry. He resolves, therefore, to place his
happiness in virtue; and disr-egarding
all temptations from interest, to adhere to
what is righlt and honourable in conduQ.
He cultivates acqluaintance with religion.
He performs, with feriodnhefs, the offices
ps devotion. H--e lays dow~n to hims~elf, a

rational

rational and useful plan of life; and, with 8 ERa M.
fsatisfadion, holds on for a while in this xv.
reformed course. But, by degrees, dif-
couragements arise. The peace which he
hoped to enjoy, is interrupted, either by
his own frailties, or by the vices of others. *
Pa~iFons, which had not been thorough-
ly s~ubdued, firuggle for their accuffom-
ed gratification. The pleasure which he
expeAed to find in devotion, sometimes
fails him; and the injuffice of the world
often fours and frets him. Friends prove
ungrateful; enemies misrepres~ent, rivals
supplant him: And part, at least, of the
mortifications which he f~uffers, he begins
to afecribe to~ virtue. Is this all the;
reward of my serving God, and renounc-
ing the pleasures of fin ? erily, in vain
I have cleansed my heart, and weaJfhed mny
hands in innocency. .Behold, the ungodly
p~roser in- th5e sorld, ·and ha~ve more than
beart can li/h ; wehile, all the day long, I
am plaguced and cha/~elPene every mornzingX.--
To su~ch persons as thiefe, ~and to all
who are in hanzard of being infeated with

t cir

SER M. their spirit, I now address myself. In rep

,X~ ply to their complaints, I purpos~e to thow,

That in no state they can choose on earth,
by no plan of condud1 they can form, it
is pofirble for them to escape uneafi~ef~s
and disappointment; that inl a life of vir-
tue, they will fuffer less uneasiness, and
fewer dif~appointmentis, than in a course
of vice a they will poffei~s much. higher
resources and advantages, and they will
be ass~ured of compleat rewardl at' the end.
From there considerations, I hope to make
it appear, that there is no fu~fficient rea-
son for our being zocary in re~eil-doing a
and that taking human life upon the
whole, Virtue is far the most eligible por-
tion of man.

I. UN EA SINL ESs and disa8ppointment are

inseparable, in s~ome degree, from every
state on earth. Were it in the power of
the world, to render those who attach
themselves to it, fagtisfied and happy, you
might then, I admit, have some t tle to
complain, if you found yourselves placed

upyon

u on worse terms in the service of God. SERM.
But this is to far from being the cafe, that V
among the multitudes who devote them-
selves to earthly pleasure, you will no-t
find a single person who has completely
attained his aim~. Enquire into the con-
dition of the high and the low, of the
gay and the serious, of the men of bu-
finefs and the men of plea~u-re, and you
thall behold them all occupied, in sup-
plying some w~ant, or In removing some
dilthers. No man is pleased with being
precisely w~hat he is. Every where there
is avoidj generally, even in the most
prosperous life, there is some corner pof-
sessed by sorrow. He who is engaged in
business, pines for leisure. He who en-
joys leis~ure, languishes for want of em-
ployment. In a fngle fate, we envy the
comforts of a family. In conjugal life,
we are chagrined with domeffic cares.
In a safe flation, we regret the wvant
of objefts for enterprise. In an enter-
prifing life, we lament: the want of safe-
ty. It is the doom of man, that his

sky

8 ER M. sky thould never be free from all clouds.

_,He is, at present, in an exiled and fallen,

slate. The obje~ts which surround him,
are beneath his native dignity. God has
tinged them all with vanity, on purpos~e to
make him feel, that: this is not his reft;
that here he is not in his proper place, nor
arrived at his true home.

If, therefore, you aim at a condition

which thall be exempted from every dif-
quiet, you purs~ue a phantom; you in-
crease the vanity and vexadtion- oflife, by
engaging in a chace s~o frugtlefs. If you
complain of virtue, because there is inci-
dent: to it a portion of that uncatinef~s
which is found in every other slate, your
complaint is moss unreasonable;, You
claim an immunity from evil, which be-
longs not to the lot of man. Reconcile
yourselves, then, to your condition; and,
inflead of looking for perse£1 happines~s
any where on earth, gladly embrace
that slate which contains the fewest
sorrow7s.

II. THOU GH

II. TiHOtTGH no condition of huiman· st RMm:

life is free from uneasiness, I contend, '5,
That the uneasines~s belonging to a sinful
couarfe, is far greater, thanl what attends
a course of v~iell-doing. If you be weary
of the labours of virtue, be assured, that
the world, whenever you try the ex-
ehange, will lay upon you a much heavier
load. it is the outside, only, of a li-
centiians life, which is gay and smiling.
W9ithini, it conceals toil, and ttouble, and
deadly sorrow. For vice poi~o~ns human
happiness in the spring, by intro~ducing
disorder into the heart. Those pafflons
which it s~eems to inldulge, it only feeds
with imp~erfed gratifications; and thereby
firenigthens them for preyting, in the end,
on their:unhappy vidtims.

It is a great miftaike to imagine, that

the pain of felf-denial is~conlfined to vir-
tue. H~e who follows the world, as much
as he who follows Christ, must tarke uip
his cross; and to himn, assuredly, it will
prove a more oppressive burden. V'ice
allows all our pailions to range unconi

trolled a

8 ER M. trolled; and where each claims ~to bei

xv. fu perior, it is impoilible to gratify all.

The predominant desire can only be in-
dulged at the expence of its rival. No
mortifacations which virtue exad~s, are
mnore severe than thos~e, which ambition
imposes upon the love of ease, pride upon
interest, and covetou~efs upon vanity.
Self-deinial therefore belongs, in com-
mon, to viCe and virtue; but with this
remarkable difference, that the pafflons
which virtue requires- us to mortify, it
tends to weaken; whereas, Ithofe~ which
vice obliges us to deny, it, at the fame
time, firengthens. l'The one diminishes
the pain of f~elf-;denial, by moderating
the demarid of pafflon; the other in-
creas~es it, by rendering those demands
imperious and violent.-What diffreffes
that occur in the calm life OF virtue, can
be compared to thos~e tortures, which re-
morse of confrcience inflias on the wicked ;
to th~ose severe humiliations, -arising from
guilt combined writh misfortunes, which

wh'ich sometimes drive them to the most
~fatal extremities, and make thern abhor
their exiffence ? How often, in the rinidft
of those difiaftrous situations, into w~hich
their crimes have brought them, have:
they curred the fiedutions of vice; and,
with bitter regret, lookred back to the
day on which, theyr first forsook the path
of innocence !

But, perh~aps, youi imagine, that to

fach miseries as there, great criminals
only are exposed; and that, by a wary
and cautious management, it is possible
to avoid them. Take vice and virtue,
then, in the most general point of view.
Compare God and the world as two maf~-
ters, the one or other of whom you
must obey; and confider fairly, in whose
fTerviee there will be reason for your being
weary soonest, and repenting moftr fre-
quently. The world is both a hard, and
a capricious master. To s~ubmit to a long
s~ervitude, in the view of a recom~pense
from whkich they are excluded in the end,

SE I1v. is known to be: ofteri the fate of thole,

x who are devoted to the wor~ld. They fa-

crifice thneir pres~ent ease, to· their futiure
profipeis. Tihey court the great, and
flatter the multitu~de. They prostitute
their confcienice, and diifhonour their cha-
r~ader : Arid, after all their efforits, how
uncertain is their flicce~s ! Competitors
juffle, and outfirip themi. The more art-:
ful deceive, the more viorlenit overthr~ow
them. Fair profipeas once fmniled; but
clouds soon gather; the iky is darkened a'
the f~cenle changes; and that fickle world,
wihich, a momkent before, had flattered,
the next mdment, forgets theti2.

God is never mifiaken in the charadter

of his servants; for he ~eeth their- hear-ts,
and judgeth~ according to theo truth. But
the world is ofteni deceived its thcife who;
court its favouir; and, of course, is un-
just in the diffribution of its rewards.
Flattery gains the eat of power. f~raud
fSupplants mnnocence; and the pretending,
and affruming, occupy the place of the
worthyv and the modest. In vain you

judges of you solely b~y your adlions 3
and, what is worf 8, by the f~ucciefs of your
amtons, which often depen~ds not on your-
fTelves. But, in the fight of the Supreme
iBeing, good intentions s~upply the pla-ce
of good deeds, which you had not the
opportunity of performing;. The well-~
meant endeavours of the pooar, Snd t~he

But

B3ut under difalppointments, when they X~s M.
cccur, virt-ue bears us up; the world al- ......
lows us to fink. When the mind of a
good man is hurt by misfoi-tunes, religion
adminiffers the cordial, an~d infus~es the
balm. Whereas the world inflias wounds,
and then leaves them to feffer. It brings
forrowts, but it provides no consolation.
Consolation is entirely the province of re-
ligion. Supposing religion to be rinferior
to vice in external advantages, it m~ist be
allowed to poffers intertial peace, in a
mnuch higher degree. This is so certain,
thiat almost all men, at some period or
other of their life, look for ward to it,
as to a desirable retreat. When the ends
of their present pursuit thall be accom-
plithed, they propose -to themselves much
fatisfa£1ioir, in an h'onourable djifcharge
of the duties of their flation, amidst
those moderate pafflons, and temperate
pleasures, which innocence allows. :That
which all men agree in holding to be f~e-
cond in importance to the purs~uit whichi
they follow, may be safely efleemed to be

G ga the

SER M. the first in real worth; and it may be

c.C concluded, that if they were not blinded

by some prevailing passion, they would
discern and adopt it as fuceh.

It is the peculiar effed of virtue, to

make a, man's chief happinefrs aris~e from
himfiielf and'his own condudi. A bad man
is wholly the creature of the world. He
hlangs upon its favour, lives by its fmniles,
and is happy or miserable, in proportion
to his fauccefs. But to a virtuious man,
fauccefs, in worldly undertakings, is but a
secondary ob~jedt. To discha~rge his own
part with integrity and honour,. is his
chief aim. If he has done properly what
was incumbent on him to do, his mind
is at reft; to Providence he leaves the
event. His~r zevitnz~ is in heavlen, and his
record is on high~. Satisfied with the ap-
probation of God, and the teffimony of a
good conscience, he enjoys hims~elf, and
der~pires the triumphs of guilt. In pro-
portion as s~uch manly principles rule your
heart, you will become independent of
the world; and will forbear complaining

of its dif~couragements. It is the imper- SERM
feaion of your virtue, which occasions
you to be roeary in welel-doing. It is be-
cause your hearts remain divided between
God and the world, that you are to often
discontented; partly withing to discharge
your duty, and partly seeking your hap-
piners from somewhat that is repugnant to
your duty. Study to be more consistent
in principle, and more uniform in praaice,
and your peace will be more unbroken.

Though virtue may appear at first fight

to contradt the bounds of enjoyment, you
will find, upon refleAion, that, in truth,
it enlatrges them. If itrefarains the excess
of some pleasures, it favours and increases
others. It precludes you from none, but
s~uch as are either fantastic and imagina-
ry, or pernicious and deftrudive. What-
ever is truly valuable in human enjoy-
ment, it allows to a good man, no less
than to others. It not only allows him
fouch pleasures, but heightens them, by
that grateful reiih which a good confci-
ence gives to every plepdure, It not only

heightens

SER M. heightens them, but adds to them, are~,

XCV Sthe peculiar f~atisfaftions which flow from

vtirtuous s~enti~ments, from dtevout affeLi-
ons, and religious hopes. On how much
wMorfe terms is the finner placed, in the
midit of his boasted· gratifications ?Hi
portion is confined to this world~. ~His
good th7ilngs are all of one for-t onlly; he
ha-s neither know~ledge, nor reliib, of any
thing beyond them. His en~joyment, there-
fore, rests on a. much narrower basis, than·
that of the servants of God. Enlarge, as
much as youl please·, the circle of wiorld-
ly gratifications 3 yet, if nothing of the
mnind and the heart, nothing of a refined
and moral nature, enter into that circle,
and vsary the enjoyment,. languor and
we~ariness soon su~cceed. Among whom
do youc hear more peevish· exprefl~ous of
diifcontent, or more fr~equent complaints of
lowt sp:irits, than among the profeffe~d vo-
taries of worldly pleasure

Vice and virtue, in thecir progre~s~, as

in every other reifped, hold an opposite
course. Thle beginnings of vice are en-·

vancement, are 'flattering and pleaTing:.X;
But the continuance of s~uccess blunts en-
joyment, and flattens desire. Whereas
the begrinnings of virtue are laborious.
But by perseverance, its labours dimi-
aiih, and its pleasures increase. As it ri-
pens into confirmed habit, it becomes
both fmnoother in pra~tice, and more com-
plete in its` reward. In a worldly life, the
term-ination of our hopes always meets
our view. We fee a boundary before us,
beyond which we cannot reach. But
the prof~pefts of virtue are growing, and
endless:. The righdteous fall hol1d on i'n his·

with an evil worldj; the Text fuiggefts

diue eafon yosu shall reap, if youe Joint nzot.
It is not a loose encoura gement, or a du-,
bious hope, which is heki. forth to us. A
direQ and explicit declaration is made by
the Spirit of God, that piety and virtue,
howv disc~ouraged soever, or oppressed, they
may be for a while, thall not be fruffrat-
ed of their reward; but that in du~e Jca-
son, when the period whicht is fixed by
the Divine decree ha~ll come, all who have
not been weary in weell-doing, though they
may have/ow~n in tear~s, Jharll reap mn Joy.
As this great principle of faith is so essen-
tial to our present argument, and is mn-
deed the foundation of all religion, it
will be proper that we now take a view
of th:e groun"ds on which it rests. By fix-

ing

ing our attention, both on the proofs 8 E Rht
which reason suggests, and on the disco-
veries which revelation has made, of a
slate of future retribution, wNe (hall take
an effeecual method of confirming; our ad-
herence to religion, and of baffling those
temptations which might lead us to be
werary in weell-doi'ng.

THE firfL.· and most obvious pref~ump-

tion, which reason affords in behalf of
future~ rewards to the righteous, arises
from the impedfed diffribution of good
and evil in our preifent slate. Notwith-
flanding what I have advanced concern-
ing the pleas~ures and advantages of vir-
tue it cannot be denied, that the happi-
ness of good men is often left incomplete.
The vicious poffers advantages, to which
they have no right; while the confcien-
tious fuffer for the fake of virtue, and
groan under difterefes which they have
not merited from the world. Indeed,.were
the diffribution of good and evil, in this
life, altogether promifouous; could it be

~a id,

SE R M/. agidP, with truth, that the~ moral conditiory

xv. of men had no influence whatever u on

their happiness~ or misery; I admit, that
from such a Htate of things, no prefump-
tion wvould arise, of any future retribu-
tion being intended. They who delight
to aggravate the miseries of life, and the
diitreffes of virtue, do nro service to the
argrumnent in behalf of Providence. For,
if total disorder be found to prev-ail now,
fulpiicions may, toq justly, arise, of its
prevailing for ever. If he who rules the
univ ers~e, entirely neglefts virtue here, the
probability must be small, of his reward-
ing it hereafter. iBut this is far from be-
ing the true slate of the faAt. What hu-
mian life presents to the view of an impar-
tial obs~erver, is by no means a sc~ene of
entire confusion; but a state of order, be-
~u n, anrdcarried on a certain length. Virtue
is to far from being neglet~ted by the Go-
vernor of the. wcorld, that from many evi-
dent: marks, it appears to be a chief obje~t
of hlis care. In the conflitution of human
nature, a foundation is laid, for comfort

to the righteous, and for internal punith- SERM.
ment to the wicked. -Throu hout the xv.C
ccufe orfDivine government, tendencies
towa~srds the happines~s of the one, and the
misery of the other, constantly appear.
They are so conifpicuous, as not: to have
escaped the notice of the rudest nations.
Over the whole earth, they have diffufed
the belief, that: Providence is propitious
to virtue, and adverse to guilt. Yet there
tendencies are, sometimes disappointed of
their effeQ; and' that which Providence
visibly favours, is left, at present, with--
ou~t an adequate reward.

From such an i~mperfea diffribution of

happines~s, what are we to ~conclude, but,
that this fyfiem is the beginning, not the
whole of things; the opening only of a
more extentive plan, whose cons~ummation
reaches into a future world ? If God has
already f·t hiSZ throne for judgment~ ; if he
has viiibly begun to reward and t~o pui
nifh, in some degSree, on earth, he can-
not mean to leave the exercis~e of govern-
ment incomplete. Having laid the foun-

dation

SER M. dation of a great and noble firudure, he

xV. will in due time rear it up to perfeAion.

The unfinished parts of the fabric evi-
dently thow, that a future building is in-
tended. All his other works are conftrudt-
ed according to the rnoft full and exad
proportion. In the natural world, nothing
is deficient, nothing redundant~. Itis in
the moral world, only, that we discover
irregularity and defeat. It falls thort of
that order and perfeaion, which appear
in the reft of the creation. It exhibits
not in its present slate, the fame features
of complete wisdom, juffice or goaodnels.
But can we believe, that, under the go-
vernment of the Supreme Being, those
apparent disorders thall not be redtified
at the last ? Or, that from his conduA
towards his rational creatirres, the chief
of his works, the sole objeaion against
his perfedion thall be allowed to rife, and
thall continue unremoved for- ever.

On the s~upposition of future rewards

and punifhrments, a satisfying account can
be given, of all the disorders which at

present

present take place on earth. Chriftianityp SE RVM:.h
explains their origin, and traces them to
their issue. M'an, fallen from his primae-
val felicity, is now undergoing probation
and discipline for his final slate. Divine
juffice remains, for a leafon, concealed;
and allows men to sat their parts with
fr1eedom on this theatre, that their cha-
radters may be formed and ascertained.
Amidst dif~couragements and a~ffiaions,
the righteous give proof of their fidelity,
and acqjuire the babits of virtue. But if
you suppose the events of this life to have
no reference to another, the whole slate
of man becomes, not only inexplicable,
but coritradiAory, and inconfilent. The
powers of the inferior animals are per-
fealiy suited to their flation. They know
nothing higher than their prefbut condi-
tion. In gratifying their appetites, they
-fulfil their deffiny, and pass awr-ay. Mlan,
alone, comes forth to adt a part, which
carries no meaning, and tends to no end.
Endowed with capacities, which extend
far beyond his present. f~pere; fitted by

his

8 ER MZ. his rational nature for running the race

X of immortality, he is flopped th~ort in the

very entrance of his course~. He squanders
his adtivity on purs~uit~s, which he discerns
to be vain. He languishes for knowledge,
which is placed beyond .his reach. He
thirfis after a happiness,, which he is
doomed never to enjoy. He fees, and
laments the difiafters of his slate; and
yet upon this supposition, can find no-
thing ~to remedy them.-Has the eternal
God any pleasure in s~porting himself with
s~uch a scene of misery and folly, as this
life, if it hnad no connecrion with another,
must exhibitto his eye Did hecall into
existence this magnificent universe, adorn
it with so much beauty and splendour,
and firrround it with those glorious lumi-
naries which· w~e behold in Ithe heavens,
only that some generations of mortal men
might arise to behold there wonders, and
then disa~ppear for ever? How unfiuitable,
In this caf~e, were the habitation to the
wretched inhabitant ! How inconfifent:
the commencement of his being, and the

inighty preparation of his powers andSE RVM·.
Faculties, with his despicable end ! How ^

.

contradia~ory, in fine, were every thing
which concerns the state of man, to the
wisdom and perfeaiton of his Maker !

Througho~ut all ages, and among all na-

tions, the perfuation of si future life has
prevailed. It sprung niot from the refine-
ments of jrcie'nce, or the speculations of
philosophy a but from a deeper and fIrong-
er root, the natural fCentiments of the hu-
man heart. H~ence it is common to the
philosopher and the s~avage ; and is found
in the moss barbarous, as well as in the
most civilized regions. Even the belief of
the being of a God, is not more general
on the earth, than the belief of immorta-
lity. Dark, indeed, and confuf~ed,were
the notions which men entertained con-
cerning afuture slate. Yet flill, in that
slate, they looked for retribution, both to
the good, and the bad ; and in the per-
~feation of fuzch pleasures, as they knew
best, and valued moss highly, they placed
the rewards of the virtuous. So univer-

8 ER M. ial a conieat seems plainly to indicate, anl

xV . ori inal determination given to the foul by

its Creator. It shows this great truth, to
be native and congenial to man.

When we look into out own breasts,

we find various anticipations and presages
of future existence. Most of our great
and high pafirons, extend beyond the li-
mits of this life. The ambitious and the
felf-denied, the great, the gotod, and the
wicked, all take interest, in what is to
happ~en after they thall have left the earth.
TZhat passion for fame, which inspires to
much of the altivity of manlkind, p~lainly
i~s animated by the perfuation, that cori-
f~ciodnef~s is to fiurvive the dissolution of
the body. The virtuous are s~upported by
the hope, the guilty tormented with the
dread, of what is to take plac'e after
death. As death approaches, the hopes of
the one, and the fears of the other, are
found to redouble. The foul when jiffuing
hence, s~eems more~ clearly to dik'ern its
future abode. All the operations of con-

s~cience,

ifcience, proceed upon the belief of imn- .SERhi
mortalit . T'he whole moral con~duat of . V._
men refers to it. All legislators ha~ve sup~-
posed it. All religions are built upon it.
It is to essential to the order of society,
that were it erase~d, human laws wtould
prove ineffe~tual restraints from evil, and~
a deluge of crimes and. m~ieries wisouki
overflow the earth~. 'To f~uppo~e this uni-
versal~ and powverful belief to be without
foundation in truth, is to s~uppose, that
a principle of delusion was interwoven
with the nature of man; is t~o s~uppose~,
that his Creator was reduced to the neceif-
fity of impreiling his heart w~ith a fa~e
hood, in order to make him adwier the
purposes of his being.

By7T though there arguments be firong,

yet all arguments are liable to objedtion.
Perhaps this general belief,of which I have
spoken, has been owvingr to inclination and
desire, more than to evidence. Perhaps,
in our reasonings on this fub~jeat from the
Divine perfe~tions, w~e flatter ourselves

VoL. I. 11 h with

SER M. with being of more confequence,'than we

XV.
i _, truly are, in the system of the univers~e.

Hence the great importance of a dif~cove-
ry proceeding from God himse~lf, which
gives full authority to all that reason had
f~uggefied, and prlaces this capital truth be-
yond the reach of furpicion or diitruff.

The method which Christianity has ta-

Icen to convey to us the evidence of a fu-
ture slate, highly deserves our attention.
Had the Gospel been addressed, like a
ijyftem of philosophy, s~olely to the under-
flanding of men; had it aimed only at
enlightening the fludious and refle~ing, it:
would have confined its~elf to abftradt
truth; it would. have simply informed us,
that the righteous are hereafter to be re-
warded, and sinners to be punished. Such
a declaration as thatcontained in the Text,
would have been f~uficient: Be not weaery
in ·well-doing ; for- in dure season you }ballI'
rea2p, i~f you fainzt nzot. But the- Gospel
has not flopped, at barely announcing life
and immortal~ity to mankind. It was cal-
cubsted for popular edification. It was

the few, w~hose understanding was to be
informed; but of the many, alfo>, whos~e
imagination was to be impressed, and
whose paflions were to be awakened, in
order to give the truth its due influenee
over them. Upon this account it not only
reveals the certainty of a future slate, but,
in the person of the great Founder of our
religion, exhibits a series of fadts relating
to it; by means of which, our senses, our
imagination, and pafflons, all become in-
terefled in this great objea.

The ref'urreation of Christ from the

grave, wvas designed to be a s~ensible evi-
dence, that death inafers not a final ex-
tinaloin of the living principle. He rose,
in order to show, that, in our name, he
had conquered death, and was becomye the
f~rJ fruits o~f them th5at sleep. Nor did he
only rife from the grave, but by as~cend-
ing to heaven in a visible form, before
many wr-itneffes, gave an ocular fpEecimen
of the tradiition from this world, into the
region of the blessed. The employrmenits

circumstances of his coming again, are
dift-n~tly foretold. The founding of the
lafl trumpet, the ref~urredion of the dead,
the appearance of the Judge, and the
s~olemnity with which he thall diiferiminate
the good from the bad, are all deferibed.
The veryp words in which he ihall pro-
nounce the final fCeatence, are recited in
our hearing : Come, ye blefed of my Fath~er !

of firiking circumflances and fa £s, the
Gorpel familiariz~es us in fCome meas~ure
with a future Rtate. By accommodating
this grea~t dis~covery, in t~o us~eful a manner,
to the conceptions of men, it furnishes a
firong intrinsic evidence of its divine
crigmn.

THUs, upon the whole, whether you
consult your reason, or listen to thle diifco-
veries of revelation, you behold our argu-
ment confirmed; you behold a life of piety
-and vir tue, ifruing in immortal felicity.

Of what worldly pursuit can it be pro-
nounced, th~at its reward is certain ? Look
every where around you, and you thall
fee, that the race is far from being alr iys
to the swift, or the attlle to the/lrong. T he
most dilige;nt, the most wife, the most ac-

is laida up the crolon of` lye. T heir final
happiness is prepared in the eternal plan
of Providence, and secured by the labours
and f~ufferings of the Saviour of the world.
