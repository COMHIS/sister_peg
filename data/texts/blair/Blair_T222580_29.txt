ON THE DUTIlES OF THE YOUNG.

The uncertainty of the enjoyments of human life
checks presumption; the multiplicity of its dangers
demands perpetual caution. Moderation, vigilance,
and self government, are duties incumbent on all; but
especially on such as are beginning the journey of life.
The scenes which present themselves, at our entermng

upontheword, re ommnlyflattering. What-

ever they be in themselves, thelvlysrtsoth
young gild every opening prospect. The field of
hope appears to stretch wide before them. Pleasure
seems to put forth its blossoms on every side. Im-
pelled by desire, forward they rush with inconsider,
ste ardour: Plompt to decide, and to chuse; averse
to hesitate, or to inquire; credulous, because untaught
by expenience; rash, because unacquainted with dan-
ger; headstrong, because unsubdued by disappoint.
ment. As soon as you are capable of reflection,
you must perceive that there is a right and a wrong
in human actions. You see that those who are born
with the same advantages of fortune, are notall equally
p~~·roserous in the course of life. While some of them,

bwise and steady conduct, attain distinction in the

world, and pass their days with comfort and honours
others, of the same rank, by mean and vicious behav-
lour, forfeit the advantages of their birth, involve
themselves in much misery, and end in being a dia.
grace to their friends, and a burden on society. Early,
then, you may learn, that it is not on the external con.
dition in which you find yourselves placed, but on
the part which you are to act, that your welfare or
ulnhappiness, your honour or infamy,depend. Now,
when beginning to act that part, what can be of greater

moment, then to regulate your plan of conduct with
the most serious attention, before you have yet com.
mitted any fatal or irretrievable errors ? If, instead of
exerting reflection for th is valuable purpose, yon del iv.
er yourselves up at so critical a time, to sloth and plea.
sure; if you refuse to listen to any counsellor but hu-
mour, or to attend to any pursuxt except that of amuse.
ment; if yon allow yourselves to float loose and careless
on the tide of life, ready to receive any direction
which the current of fashion may chance to give you,
what can you expect to follow from such beginnings?'
While so many around you are undergoing the sad
consequences of a like indiscretion, for what reason
shall not those consequences extend to you? Shall
you attain success without that preparation, azid es.
cape dangers without that precaution, which is re.
quired of others ? Shall happiness grow up to you,
of its own accord, and solicit your acceptance, when,
to the rest of mankind, it is the fruit of long cultiva.
tion, and the acquisition of labour and care ?--De.
ceive not yourselves with such arrogant hopes. What.
ever be your rank, Providence will not, for your sake,
reverse its established order. The A4uthor of your be.
ing hath enjoined you to take heed to y.our wrays; to
fonder thec Pathis ofyourr set; to remember your Creator in
the days of youlr youth.~ He hath decreed, that they
only who seek after w~isdo~m Jhalljnd it ; that fools Jhall
be aficted because oftheir transgressions; and that wh~o-
.co refuseth instruction shall destroy his ow~n soul. By list-
ening to these admonitions, and tempering the vivacity
of youth with a proper mixture of serious thought, you
may ensure cheerfulness for the rest of life; but by de.
Jivering yourselves up at present to giddiness and ley-
ity, you lay the foundation of lasting heaviness of
heart. When you look forward to those plans
of life, which eith~r your circumstances have suggest-
ed, or your friends have proposed, you will not hesi-
tate to acknowledge that, in order to pursue them with

advantage, some previous discipline is requisite. Be
assured, that whateveris to be your profession, no edu.
cation is more necessary to your success, than the
acquirement of virtuous dispositions and habits. This
is the universal preparation for every character, and
every station in life. Bad as the world is, respect is
always paid to virtue. In the usual course of human
affairs, it will be found, that a plain understanding
joined with acknowledged worth, contributes more to
prosperity, than the brightest parts without probiy
or honour. Whetherscience,orbusiness,orpubliclife
be your aim, virtue still enters, for a principal share,
into all those great departments of society. It is con-
nected with eminence in every liberal art; with repu.
tation, in every branch of fair and useful business; with
distinction, inevery publicstation. Thevigourwhich
it gives the mind,and thle weight which it addsto char-
acter; the generous sentiments which it breathes, the
undaunted spirit which it inspires, the ardour of dili-
gence which it quickens. the freedom which it procures
from pernicious and dishonourable avocations, are the
foundations of all that is high in fame, or great in suc-
cess among men. Whatever ornamental or en.
gagoing endowments you now possess, virtue is a neces-
sary requasate, an order to their shining with proper
lustre. Feeblearethe attractions of the fairest form, if
it be suspected that nothing within corresponds to the
pleasing appearance without. Short are the triumphs
of wit,when it is supposed to be the vehicle of malice.
By whatever arts you may at first attract the attention,
youcan hold theesteem, and secure theheartsofothers,
only by amiable dis positions,ard the accom plishments
as the mind. T~hese are the qualities whose influence
will last, when the lustre of all that once sparkled and
dazzled has passed away. L~et not then the season
of youth be barren of imnprovements so essential to
y·ourfuturefeicity&honour. Noivis theseed-timeof
life; and according to what you sow, you shallreap. Y our

A3

charater is now, under Divine assistance, of your own
forming; your fate is, in some measure, put into your
own hands. Your nature is as yet plaint and soft.
Habits have not established their dommnion. Preju.
dices have not pre-occupied your understanding. The
world has not had time to contract and debase your
affections. All your powers are more vigorous, dis-
embarrassed, and free, than they will be at any future
period. Whatever impulse you now give to your de.
aires and passions, the dilrection is likrely to continue.
It will form the channel in which vour life is to run;
nay, it may determine its everlasting issue. Consider
then the employment of this important period as the
highest trust which shall ever be committed to you;
as, in a great measure, decisive of your happiness, ia
time, and in eternity. As in the succession of the sea-
sons, each, by the invariable laws of Nature, affects
the productions of what is next in courses so, in human
life, every period of our age, according as ,it is well
.or ill spent, influences the happiness of that which is
to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward
accomplished and flourishing manhood; and such
manhood passes of itself, without uneasiness, into
respectable and tranquil old age. But when Nature is
turned out of its regularcourse,disordertatkes place in
the moral, just as in thevegetableworld. If the Spring
put forth no blossoms, in Summer there will be no
beauty, and in Autumn no fruit. So, if youth be
trifled away without improvement, manhood will be
contemptible, and old age miserable. If the begin-
nings of life have been vanity, its latter end can be no
other than vexation ofspirit.

Piety to God is he foundation of good morals, and

is adisposition particularly graceful and becoming in
youth. To be void of it, argues a cold heart desti-
tute of some of the best affections which belong to that
age. Youth is the season of warm and generous emo-
tions. The heart should then, spontaneously,Jise m.-

to thle admiration of what is great, glo~w with the love
of what is fair and excellent, and melt at the discov-
ery of tenderness and goodness. Where can any ob.
ject be found, so proper to kindle those affections, as
the Father of the universe, and the Author of all fe-
licity ? Unmoved by veneration, can you contemplate
that grandeur and majesty, which his works every
where display? Untouched by gratitude, can you view
that profusion of good, which, in this pleasing season
of life, his beneficent hand pours around you?~ Happy
in the love and affection of those with whom you are
connected, look up to the Supreme Being, as the in,
sparer of all the friendship which has ever been shewn
you by others; himself, your best and your first
friend; formerly, the supporter of your in'fancy, and
the guide of your childhood; now, the guardian of
your youth, and the hope of your coming years. View
religious homage, as a natural expression of gratitude
to him for all his goodness. Connected with so many
tender sensibilites of soul, let religion be with you,
not the cold and barren ot~spring of speculation, but
the warm and vigorous dictate of the heart. But
though piety chiefly belongs to the heart, yet the aid
of the understanding is requisite, to give a proper di.
rection to the devout affections. You must endeavour,
therefore, to acquire justviews, both of the great pran-
ciples of natural religion, and of the peculiar doc-
trines of the Gospel. For this enld, study the sacred
scriptures. Consult the word of God, more than the
systems of men, if you would know the truth in its
native purity. When, upon rational and sober inquiry,
you have established your principles, su er them not
to be shaken by the scoffsof the licentions,orthe cavils
of the sceptical. Remember, that in the examination·
of every great and comprehensive plan, such as that of
Christianity, difficulties may be expected to occur;
and that reasonable evidence is not to be rejected be-
cause the nature of our present state allows us only to

halru isr fert, and to see through a glass darkly. Im.
press your minds with reverence for all that is sacred.
Let no wantonness of youthly spirits, no compliance
with the intemperate mirth of others, ever betray you
sato prophane sallies. Besides the guilt which is there-
by incurred, nothing gives a more odious appearance
of petulance and presumption to youth, than the affec-
tation of treating religion with levity. Instead of be.
ing an ev ide nce of supe rior understanding, it d iscovers
a pert and shallow mind; which, vain of the first smat.
terings of knowledge, presumes to make light of what
the rest of mankind revere. At the same time
you are not to imagine, that when exhorted to be re.
Jigious you are called upon to become more formal
and solemn in your manners than others of the same
years,or to erect yourselves into supercilious reprov.
ers of those around you. The spirit of true religion
breathes gentleness and affability. It gives a native,
unaffected ease to the behaviour. It is social, kind,
and cheerful; far removed from that gloomy and il.
liberal superstition which clouds the brow, sharpens
the temper, dejects the spirits, and reaches men to sic
themselves for another world, by neglecting the con-
cerns of this. Let your religion. on the contrary, con-
nect preparation for heaven, with an honourable dis-
charge of the duties of active life. Let itbe associated
in your imagination, with all that is manly and useful;
with whatsoever thrings are true, are just, are pure, are
lovely, are ofgeod report, wherever therfe is any rirtue,
and wherever there is any frasse. Of such religion
discover, on every proper occasion, that you are not
ashamed; but avoid making any unnecessary ostenta-
tion of it before the world.

To piety, join modesty and docility, reverence of

your parents, and submission to those who are your
superiors in knowledge, in station, and in years. De-
pendence and obedience belong to youth. M~odesty
as one of its chief ornaments; and ~has ever been es-

teemed a presage of rising merit. When entering on
the career of life, it is your part, not to assume the
reigns as yet into your hands; but to commit yourselves
to the guidance of the more experienced, and to be.
come wise by the wisdom of those who have gone be-
fore you. Of all the follies incident to youth,
there are none which either deform its present appear-
ance, or blast the prospect of its future prosperity, more
than self-conceit, presumption, and obstinacy. By
checking its natural progress in improvement, they fix
it in long immaturity; and frequently produce mis-
chiefs, which can neverbe repaired. Yet these are vices
too commonly found among the young. Big with en-
terprise, and elated by hope, they resolve to trust for
success to none but themselves. Full of their own
abilities, they deride the admonitions which are given
them by their friends, as the timorous suggestions of
age. Too wise to learn, too impatient to deliberate,
too forward to be restrained, they plunge, with preci-
pitant indiscretion, into the midst of all the dangers
with which life abounds. Slcot thou a young man wise in
his own con~cit? There is more hope ofa fool, than of him.
--Positive as you now are in your opinions, and con-
sident in your assertions, be assured, that the timne ap.
proaches when both men and things will appealr to you
in a different light. Many characters which you now
admire, will, by and by, sink in your esteecm; and
many opinmons, of which you are at present most tena-
cious, will alter as you advance in years. Distrust,
therefore, that glare of youthful presumption, which
dazzles your eyes. Abound not in your own sense.
Put not yourselves forward with too much eagerness;
nor imagine, that by the impetuosity of juvenile ar-
dour, you can overturn systems which have been long
established, and change the face of the world. Learn
not to thinkh more htighly of yourselves than you ought, but
to think soberly~. By patient and gradual progression an
improvement, you may, in due time, command lasting

esteem. But by assuming, at present, a tone of supe.
riority, to which you have no title, you will disgust
those whose approbation it is most important to gamn.
Forward vivacity may fit you to be the companions of
an idle hour. More solid qualities must recommend
you to the wise, and mark you out for importance
and considerartion in subsequent life.

It isnecessary to recommend to you, sincerity and

truth. This isthe basis of every virtne. That dark.
ness of character, where we can see no heart; thoer
foldings of art, through which no native affection is
allowed to penetrate, present an object, unamiable in
every season of life, but particularly odious in youth.
If, at an age when the heart is warm, when the emo-
trons are strong, and when nature is expected to
shew itself free and open, you can already smile and
deceive, what are we to look for when you shall be
longer hackneyed in the ways of men; when interest
shall have completed the obduration of your heart, and
experience shall have improved you in all the arts of
paile ? Dissimulation in youth, is the fore-runner of
perfidy in old age. Its first appearance is the fatal o.
men of growing depravity, and future shame. It de.
grades parts and learning; obscures the lustre of every
accomplishment; and sinks you into contempt with
God and man. As you value, therefore, the ap-
probation of Heaven, or the esteem of the world, cul.
tivate the love of truth. In all your proceedings be di-
rect and consistent. Ingenuity and candour possess
the most powerful charm; they bespeak universal fa.
vour, and carry an apology for almost every failing.
The lip3 of truth skall be established for ever; but ar lying
tonrgue, as but for a moment. The path of truth, is a
plain and a safe path; that of falsehood, is a perplexing
maze. After the first departure from sincerity, it is not
in your power to stop. One artifice unavoidably leads
on to another; till, as the intricacy of the labyrinth
increases, you are lcft entangled in your own anare.

of conduct. It betrays, at the same time, a dastardly
spirit. It is the resource of one who wants courage to
avow his designs, or to rest upon himself. Whereas,
openness of character displays that generous boldness
which ought to distingmish youth. To set out in the
world with no other principle than a crafty attention
to interest, betokens one who is destined for creepmng
through the inferior walks of life. But to give an early
preference to honour above gain, when they stand in
compedtiton; to despise every advantage, which can.
not be attained without dishonest arts; to brook no
meanness, and to stoop to no dissimrultion; are the
indications of a great mind, the prea~gesr of future em.
inence and distinction in life. At the same time,
this virtuous sincerity is perfectly consistent with the
most prudent vigilance and caution. It is opposed to
cunning, not to true wisdom. It is not the simplicity
of a weak and improvident, but the candour of an
enlarged and noble mind; of one who scorns deceit,
because he accounts it both base and unprofitarble;
and who seeks no disguise, because he needs none to
hide him.

Youth is the proper season of cultivating the be.

nevolent and humane affections. As a great part of
your happiness is, to depend on the connections which
you form with others, it is of high importance that
y~ou acquire, betimes, the temper and the manners
which will rendersuchconnections comfortable. Let
a sense of justice be the foundation of all your social
qualities. In your most early intercourse with the
world, and even in your youth~ful amusements, let no
unfairness be found. Engrarve on your mind that sa-
cred rule, of doing all things to dthers, according as yosr
roiskr that they shlould doyustyu For this end, impress
yourselves with a deep sense of the original and nat..
ural equality of men, Whatever advantages of birth

or fortune you possess, never display them with an os.
tentatious superiority. Leave the subordinations of
rank, to regulate the intercourse of more advanced
years. At present, it becomes you to act among your
companions, as manwith man. Remember how un-
known to you are the vicissitudes of the world; and
how often they, on whom ignorant and contemptuous
young men once looked down with scorn, have risen
to betheirsuperiors in future years. 'Compassion
asoan emotion of which you ought never to be a-.
shamed. Graceful in youth is the tear of sympathy
and the heart that mells at the tale of woc. Let- not
case and indulgence contract your affectiona, and wrap
yo up in selfish enjoymrents. But go sometimesto the
house of m~ourning, as well as to the house of jhasting.
Accustom yourselves to think of the distresses of hu.
man life; of the so~litary cottage, the dying parent,
and the weeping orphan. Never sport with pain and
distress, mn any of your amusements; nor treat even
the meanest insect with wanton cruelty. In
yotmg minds there is commonly a strong propensity
to particular intimacies and friendships. Youth in-
deed, is the season when friendships are sometames
formed, which not only continue through succeeding
life, but which glow to the last, with a tenderness
unknown to the connections begun in cooler years.
The propensity therefore' is not to be discouraged;
though at the same time it must be regulated with
much circumspection and care. Too many of the
pretended friendships of youth, are mere~ combina-
tions in pleasure. They are often founded on capri-
cious likrings; suddenly contracted, and as suddenly
dissolved. Sometimes they are the effect of interested
complaisance and flattery on the one side, and of cred-
ulous fondness on the other. Beware of such rash and
dangerous connections, which may afterwards load
you with dishonour. Remember that by the charac-
ter of those whom you choose for your friends, your

rwn is likely to be formed, and will certainly be judg-
ed ofby the world. Be slow, therefore, and cannious
in contracting intimacy; but when a virtuous friend*
ship is once established, consider it as a sacred engarge-
ment. Expose not yourselves to the reproach of light.
ness and inconstancy, which always bespeakr, either
a trifling, or abase mind. Reveal none of the screts
of your friend. Be faithful to his interests. Forsake
him not in danger. Abhor the thought of acquiring
any advantage by his prejudice or hurt. in
order to render yourselves amiable in society, cor.
rect every appearance of harshness in behaviour.
Let that courtesy distinguish your demeanor, which
springs, not so much from studied politeness, as from
a mild and gentle heart. Follow the customs of the
world in matters indifferent; but stop when they be.
come sinful. Letyourmanners be simple and natural;
and of course they will be engaging. Affectation is
certain deformity. By forming themselves on fantastic
models, and vying with one another in every rezgnlng
folly, the young begin with being ridiculous, and end
in being vicious and immoral.

The love of pleasure, natural to man in every period

of his life, glows at this age with excessive ardour.
Novelty adds fresh charms, as yet, to every grati-
fication. The world appears to spread a continual
feast; and heakth, vigour, and high spirits, invite
them to partake of it without restraint. In vain we
w~arn them of latent dangeh, . Religion is accused of
iansufferable severity, in prohibiting enjoyment, and
the old, when they offer their admonitions, are up.
braided with having forgot that they once were young.
--And yet, my friends, to what do the restraiats of
religion, and the counsels of age, with respect to plea-
sure, amount ? They may all be comprized in few
words, not to hurt yourselves, and not to hurt others,
by your pursuit of pleasure. WCithin these bounds
pleasure is lawful; beyond them, it becomes criminal,

28 B

because it is ruinous. Are these restraints any other
that what a wise man would choose to impose on
himself ? We call you not to renounce pleasure, but
to enjoy at in safety. Instead of abridgmng it, weex-
hort you to pursue it on an extensive plan. We pro.
pose measures for securing its possession, and for pro.
longing its d ur ation. Consult your whole nature.
Consider yourselves not only as sensitive, but as
rational beings; not only as rational, but social;
not only as social, but immortal. Whatever violates
your nature in any of these respects, cannot afford
true pleasure; any more than that which undermines
an essential part of the vital system can promote
health. For the truth of this conclusion, we ap.
peal not merely to the authority of religion, nor
to the testimony of the aged, but to yourselves and
your own experience. We ask, Whether you have not
found, that in a course of criminal excess, your plea-
sure was more than compensated by succeeding pain?
Whether, if not from every particular instance, yet
from every habit, at least, of unlawful gratification,
there did not sprang some thorn to wound you, there
did not arise some consequence to make you repent of
it in the issue? If you have any consideration or any
farmness left, avoid temptations, for which you have
found yourselves unequal, with as much care, as you
would shun pestilential infection. Break off all con-
nections with the loose and profligate. Wh'ien sinners
entlic thee, consent thou not. Look not on the wine when it
is red, when it giveth its colour in thre cup ; for at the last,
it biteth like a serpent, and stingethr lik~e an adder. Re-
arove thy way fromA the strange wtoman, and come not near
thredoor ofhr hourse. Let not thine hart decline to er
ways; for her house is

le~ the ay ohll Thiou goesaterc

her as a bird hasteth to thre snare; and knoweth not that
it is for hirlife. By these unhappy excesses of ir-
regular pleasure in youth, how many amiable dispo-
sitions are corrupted or destroyed!i How many rising

capacities and powers are suppressed I How many
flattering hopes of parents and friends are totally ex-
tinguished!i Who but must drop a tear over human
nature, when he beholds that morning which arose so
bright, overcast with such untimely darkness; that
good humour which once captivated all hearts, that
vivacity which sparkled in every company, those abil-
ities which were fitted for adorning the highest sta-
tion, all sacrificed at the shrine of low sensuality; and
one who was formed for running the fair career of
life in the midst of public esteem, cut off by his vices
at the beginning of his course, or sunk, for the whole
of it, into insignificancy and contempt!--These, O
sinful Pleasure I are thy trophies. It is thus that, co-
operating with the foe of God and man, thou de.
gradest human honour and blastest the opening pros.
pects of human felicity.

Diligence, industry, and proper improvement of

time are material duties of the young. To no purpose
are they endowed with the best abilities, if they want
activity for exerting them. Unavailing, in this case,
will be every direction that can be given them, either
for their temporal or spiritual welfare. In youth
the habits of industry are most easily acquired. In
youth, the incentives to it are strongest, from ambi-
tion and from duty, from emulation and hope, from
all the prospects which the beginning of life affords.
If, dead to these calls, you already languish in sloth.~
ful inaction, what will be able to quicken the more
sluggish current of advancing years ? Industry
as not only the instrument of improvement, but the
foundation of pleasure. Nothing is so opposite to
the true enjoyment of life, as the relaxed and feeble
state of an mndolent mind. He who is a stranger to
industry, may possess, but he cannot enjoy. For it
is labour only which gives the relish to pleasure. It
a the appointed vehicle of every good to man. It is
the indispensable condition of our possessing a sound

mind in a sound body. Sloth is so inconsistent with
both, that it is hard to determine whether it be a
greater foe to virtue, or to health and happiness. Ia.
active as it is in itself, its effects are fatally power-
ful. Though it appear a slowly flowing stream, yet it
undermines all that is stable and flourishing. It not
only saps the foundation of every virtue, but pours
upon you a deluge of crimes and evils. It is like wa.
ter which first putrifies by stagnation, and then sends
up noxxious vapours, and fills the atmosphere with
death. Fly, therefore, from idleness, as the
certain parent both of guilt and of ruin. And under
idleness I include, not mere inaction only, but all that
circle of trifling occupations, in which too many
saunter away their youth; perpetnally engaged in
frivolous society, or public amusements an the la.
bours of dress, or the ostentation of their persons.--
1s this the foundation which you lay for future useful.
ness and esteem? By such accomplishments, do you
hope to recommend yourselves to the thinking part
·of the world, and to answer the expectations of your
friends and your country?~-Amusements, youth re.
quires. It were vain, it were cruel to prohibit them.
But though allowable as the relaxation, they are most
culpable as the business of the young. For they then
become the gulf of time, and the poison of the mind.
They foment had passions. They weaken the man.
ly powers. They sink the native vigour of youth, in-
to contemptible effeminacy. Redeeming your
time from such dangerous waste, seek to fill it with
employments which you may review with satisfac.
tion. The acquissanon of knowledge is one of the
most honourable occupations of youth. The desire
of it discovers a liberal mind, and is connected with
many accomplishments, and many virtues. But though
your train of life should not lead you to study, the
course of education always furnishes proper employ-
ments to a well-disposed mind. Whatever you pursue

be emulous to excel. Generous ambition, and sensibill.
ty to praise,arezespeciallyaPtyour age, among the marksr
of virtue. Thi nk not,thatany affluence of fortune,orany
elevation of rank, exempts you from the duties ofap.
plication and industry. Industry is the law of our be.
ing; it is the demand of Nature, of reason, and of God.
Remember alwayts, that the years which now pass over
your heads, leave permanent memorials behind them.
From your thoughtless minds they may escape; but
they remain in the remembrance of God. They
form an important part of the register of your life.
They will hereafter bear testimony, either for or a-
gamnst you, at that day, when for all your actions, but
particularly for the employments of youth, you must
give an account to God. Thus I have set before
you some of the chief qualifications which belong
to a virtuous and religious character; piety, modes-
ty, truth, benevolence, temperance, and Industry.
WVhether your future course is destined to be long or
shor t, after this manner it should commence; and, if it
continue to be thus conducted, its conclusion, at what
time soever it arrives, will not be inglorious or un-

h~appy. Let your attention be recalled to that dependence
on the blessings of Heaven, which, amidst all your
endeavours after improvement, you ought continu.
ally to preserve. It is too common with the young,
even when they resolve to tread the path of virtue and
honour, to set out with presumptuous confidence in
themselves. Trusting to their own abilities for carry-
ing them successfully through life, they a re ca reless of
apply·ing to Gond, or of deriving any assistance from
wh~at they are apt to reckon the gloomy discipline of
religiori. Alas i how little do they know the dangers
w~hich await them ? Neither human wisdom, nor hu-
man~ virtue unsupported by religion, are eult h
trying situations which often occur in life.It thBy the
rhock of temptartion, how frequently have the most

B3

virtuous intentions been overthrown? Under the pres.
sure of disaster, how often has the greatest constancy
sunk? Eerty good and crleryperfect grft, is from above.
Wisdom and virtue, as well as rirche and horroa, come
from God. Destitute of his favour, you are in no better
astuation, with all your boasted abilities, than orphans
left to wander in a trackless desert, without any guide
to conduct them, or any shelter to cover them from the
gathering storm. Correct, then this ill-founded arro-
gance. Expect not, that your happiness can be inde.
pendent of him who made you. By faith and repent-
ance, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By prety
and prayer, seek the protection of the God of heaven.
In fine, remember the solemn words, in which a great
Prince delivered his dying charge to his son; words

# ON THE DUTIES OF SCHOOL BOYS.

ON THE DUTIES OF SCHOOL BOYS,

FROM ROLLIN.

Quinctilian says, that he has included almost all the
duty of scholars in this one piece of advice which he
gives them, to love those who teach them, as they
love the sciences which they learn of them; and to
look upon them as fathers, from whom they derive
not the life of the body, but that instruction which
is in a1 manner the life of the soul. Indeed this sen-
timentt of affection and respect suffices to make them
apt to learn during the time of their studies, and full
of gratitude all1 the rest of their lives. It seems to me
to include a great part of what is to be expected from
them. Docility, which consists in submitting
to directions, in readily receiving the instructions of
their masters, and reducing them to practice, is proper.
ly the virtue of scholars, as that of masters is to teach
well. The one can do nothing without the other; and
as it is not sufficient for a labourer to sow the seed,
unless the earth, after having opened its bosom to re.
ceive it, in a manner hatches, warms, and moistens it;
so likewise the whole fruit of instruction depends up.
on a good correspondence between the masters and
the scholars. Gratitude for those who have la-
boured in our education, is the character of an honest
man, and the mark of a1 good heart. Who is there a-
mong us, says Cicero, that has been instructed with any
care, that is not highly delighted with the sight, or
even the bare remembrance ofhis preceptors, masters,
and the place where he was taught and brought up ?
Seneca exhorts young men to preserve always a great
respect for their masters, to whose care they are sn.
debted - for the amendment of their faults, and for
having imbibed sentiments of honour and probity.

Their exactness and severity displease sometimes at an
age when we are not in a condition to judge of the
obligations we owe to them; but when years have
ripened our understanding and judgment, we then
discern that what made us dislike them, I mean ad.
monitions, reprimands, and a severe exactness an re.
stramning the passions of an iniprudent and inconsid.
erate age, is expressly the very thing which should
make us esteem and love them. Thus we see that
Marfcus Aurelius, one of the wisest and most illustri.
ous emperors that Rome ever had, thanked the gods
for two things especially-for his having had excel.
Jent tutors himself, and that he had found the like for
his children. Quinctilian, after having noted
the different characters of the mind in children,
draws, in a few words, the image of what he judged
to be a perfect scholar; and certainly it is a very am-
iable one: a~ For my part," says he, (' I like a child
who is encouraged by commendation, is animated by
a sense of glory, and weeps when he is outdone. A
noble emulattion will always keep him in exercise, a
reprimand will touch him to the quick, and honour
will serve instead of a spur. We need not fear that
such a scholar will ever give himself up to sullenness."
Mihi ille deaur puer, quem laus excitet, quem gloria
prvet, qui virtus fleat. Hic erit alendus ambitu: hane
mordebit objurgatio: hunc honor excitabit: in hoc
desidiam nunquam verebor. H~ow great a
value soever Quinctilian sets upon the talents of the
mind, he esteems those of the heart far beyond them,
and looks upon the others as of no value without them.
In the same chapter fr-om whence I took the preced-
ing words, he declares, he should never have a good
opinion of a child, who placed his study in occasion-
ing laughter, by mimicking the behaviour, mien? and
faults of others; and he presently gives an ad mirable
reason for it: 'L A child,") says he, La cannot be truly
ingenious, in my opinion, unless he be good and vir.

tuous; otherwise, I should rather choose to have him
dull and heavy than of a bad disposition." Non
dabit spem bonae indolis, qui hoc imitandi studio pet-
it, ut rideatur. Nam probus quoque imprimis erit
ille vere ingeniosus: alioqui non pejus duxerim tardi
esse ingenii, quam mall. He displays to us all
these talents an the eldest of his two children, whose
character he draws, and whose death he laments in so
eloquent and pathetic a strain, in the beautiful pre-
face to his sixth book. I shall beg leave to insert
here a small extract of it, which will not be useless to
the boys, as they will find it a model which suits well
with their age and condition. After having
mentioned his younger son, who died at five years old,
and described the graces and beauties of his counte-
nance, the prettiness of his exrpressions, the vivacity of
his understanding, which began to shine through the
veil of childhood; "' I had still left me," says he,
" my son Quinctilian, in whom I placed all my pleasure
and all my hopes, and comfort enough I might have
found in him: for, having now entered into his tenth
year, he did not produce only blossoms like his
younger brother, but fruits already formed, and be.
yond the power of disappointment. I have muchex-
perience; but I never saw in any child, I do not say
only so many excellent dispositions for the sciences,
nor so much taste, as his masters know, but so much
probity, sweetness, good-nature, gentleness, and in-
clination to please, and oblige, as I discerned in him.

" Besides this, he had all the advantages of nature,

a charming voice, a pleasing countenance, and a sur.
prising facilaty in pronouncing well the two languages,
as if he had been equally born for both of them.

" But all this~was no more than hopes. I set a

greater value upon his admirable virtues, his equality
of temper, his resolution, the courage with which he
bore up against fear and pain; for, how were his phy-
sicians astonished at his patience under a distemper

of eight months continuance, when at the point of
death he comforted me himself, and bade me not to
weep for him! and delirious as he sometimes was at
his last moments, his tongue ran of nothing else but
learning and the sciences: O vain and deceitful
hopes!" &c. Are there many boys amongst
us, of whom we can truly say so much to their ad-
vantage, as QLuinctilian says here of his son ? What a
shame would it be for them, if, born and brought up
in a Christian country, they had not even the virtues
of Pagan children! I make no scruple to repeat them
here again--docility, obedience, respect for their mas-
ters, or rather a degree of affection, and the source of
an eternal gratitude; zeal for study, and a wonderful
thirst after the sciences, joined to an abhorrence of
vice and irregularity; an admirable fund of probity,
goodness, gentleness, civility, and liberality; as also
patience, courage, and greatness of soul in the course
of a long sickness. What then was wanting to all
these virtues?--That, which alone could render them
truly worthy the name, and must be in a manner the
soul of them, and constitute their whole value, the
precious gift of faith and piety; the saving knowledge
of a Mediator; a sincere desire of pleasing God, and
referring all our actions to him.

THE HONOUR AND ADVANTAGE OF A
CONSTANT ADHERENCE TO TRUTH.

Petrarch, a celebratrd Italian Poet, who flourished am
bout four hundred years ago, recommended himself
to the confidence and affection of Cardinal Colonna,
in whose family he resided, by his candour and
strict regard to truth. A violent quarrel occured in
the houshold of this nobleman, wh~ich was carried so
far, that recourse was had to arms. The Cardinal
wished to know the foundation of this affair; and
that he might be able to decide with justice, he as-
sembled all his people, and obliged them to bind
themselves, by a most solemn oath on the Gospels, to
declare the whole truth. Every one, without excep-
tion, submitted to this determination; even the Bish.
op of Luna, brother to the Cardinal, was not excused.
Petrarch, in his turn, presenting himself to take the
oath, the Cardinal closed the book, and said, " As to
pu91, Petrarch, your word is su~Fcient*" A sto.
ry similar to this, is related of Zenocrates, an Athen-
lan Philosopher, who lived three hundred years be-
fore Christ, and was educated in the school of Plato.
The people of Athens entertained so highr an opinion
of his probity, that one day when he approached the
altar, to confirm by an oath the truth of what he had
asserted, the judges unanimously declared his word to
be sufficient evidence.

# IDLENESS AND IRRESOLUTION.

# AFFECTION TO PARENTS.

IDLENESS AND IRRESOLUTION.

Horace, a celebrated Roman poet, relates, that a
country man, who wanted to pass a river, stood loit.
ering on the banks of it, in the foolish expectation
that a current so rapid, would soon discharge its wa.
ters. But the stream still flowed; increased, perhaps,
by fresh torrents from the mountains; and it must for
ever flow, because the sources from which it is deriv.
ed are inexhaustible. Thus the idle and irres.
ollte youth trifles over his books, or wastes in play his
preclous moments; deferring the task of improve.
ment, which at first as easy to be accomplished, but
which will become more and more difficult, the longer
it is neglected.

AFFECTION TO PARENTIS.

An amiable youth was lamenting, in terms of the sin-
cerest grief, the death of a most affectionate parent.
His companion endeavoured to console him by the re-
flection, that he had always behaved to the deceased
with duty, tenderness, and respect. So I thought, re-
plied the youth, whilst my parent was livingr: but
now 1 recollect, with pain and sorrow, many instan-
ces of disobedience and neglect, for which, alas! it is
too late to make atonement.
