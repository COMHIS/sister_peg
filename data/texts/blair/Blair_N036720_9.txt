,,~ There are other difpolitions and habits,

which, though they hold not so high a rank,
yret are necessary to the introduaion and
support of the former s and therefore, in
religious _exhortatio~ns,` there also justly claima
a place. Of this nature is that regard. to
order, mnethod~, and- regularity, which the
spofile enjoins us in the text to carry through
the whole of life. Wlhether you confider
.it as, in itself, a moral duty, or not, yet I
hope soon to convince you that it is effrential
to the proper difciharge of almoit all duties,
and merits, upon that account, a greater de-
gree of attention than is commonly paid to
at in a rehigious view.

If you look abroad into the world, you

may be satisfied at the f~irda glance, that a
vicious and. libertine life is always a life of
confufinon. Thence it is natural to infer,
that order is friendly to religion. As the
Inegled of it coincides with vice, so the
prefrervation ofit Imuff afidt virtue. By the
appointment of Providences it is indifpen-
faablly reqruifite to worldly prosperity. Thence

& £110s

(itiles a prefuniption, that it is conne~ed sER M.
areo with spiritual improvement. When cLc
you bseholdl a man's affaira, through rnie
gligence and mifcondua, involved in dif-
orders you naturally* conclude that his ruin
approaches. You mnay at the fame time

jufly utpdthat the c~auses which affed~

his temporal welfare, operate also to the
prejudice of his mporal interests. The apofile
teaches us in this chapter, that God is nfot
the author of confu/ion *. He is a lover of
<order; and all his works are full of order.
But, wherbe conlfufon .is, there is, its close
attendant, evoery evlil weork J-. In the fe-
quel of this dis~course I shall point out some
cos those parts of conduat wherein it is most
material to virtue that order take place s and
then sh~all conclude Bwthg thewing the- high
advantages whicch attend it. Allowli mes to

I rder in di~e -corduft of

y~our ~woddl~y affars. ~Every man,` in everyr
iation of life, has fotne conchrus, private,
dImeftic, or public, wvhich require falccef-
-fi~ve attention; he is placed iti some sphere
of agive duty. Let the employments
wiihich belong to that sph~ere ·be to arr~anged,
that each mnay keep its place, without just-
ling another; and that which- regards the
`irodlid dray not interfere ai-t~h ?vwhat is drie
r obdl. In proportion -to thze mnultiplicity
odf affair~s, the obfervatice of order becomes
·more ind'ifpehfable. But fearcely is there

I Tpea'k not knowt of A~fibring in point

every agie, appeared among men, to fequef-
trate religion from the. commerce of the
world31,. Se~afbas. of retreat and dlevotion
they are willing to appropriate to God.
.But the world they confider as their own

province. They carry on a fort of fep~a-
rate interest there. Nay, by the' refpe2
which, on particular occallons, they pay: to
religion, they too often imagine that they
have acquired the liberty of adf~ing in
worldly matters, according to wYhat plan
they chufe. H~ow entirely do fouch persons
mnilake the design of Christianity ?--In this
wrorld you are ~placed by Providence as on
a great field of trial. By the necessities of
you!r nature you are called forth to differ-
eaty emaployments. By maany ties you are
conne~ted with human faciety. F;om7 f~u-
periours and inferiours, from neighbours
and equals, from friends and eniemies,

th-rough all the ranks of life. Tlhis a~tive

radter; your juffice, candour, and veracity,

charge of every office which is committed
to you; your affeation for your friends;
your forgiveness of enemies; your charity

duties be discharged by persons who are
ever in that hurry and perplexity which
dis~order creates ? YSou with, perhaps, to

~What wars negleaed to be done in its pro. s ER M.
per place, thrusts itself forward at arn incon- c
venaient felafon. A nu'ltitude of a~ffairs
crowd upon you together. Different obli.
gations diffradt you; and this diffraamorP
is sometimes the rcaufe, fornetimes the pre-
tence, of equally negledinag them all, or,
at least, of sacrificing .the greater to the
less~er.

Hence arise to many inconsistent charac-

ters, and s~uch freqluent inflances of partial
and divided goodness, as we find in the
wor-ldl; appearances of generosity without
juffice, honour without truth, probity to
Imen wIithout rev~eren~e of God. He wsho
conduas his affairs with method and regua-
ltarity, meets every duty in its proper place,
and assigns it its due rank. But wvhee there
is nao order ine copndua, there cana be no uani-
formity in chara~ter. The natural connec-
tion and arrangement of duties are left. If
virtue appear at all, it will only he in fits
a~nd flarts. The authority of conscience
maay occzafionally operate, when our dituia-
tion affords it room for exertion. But in

chalradterize those who are negligent of or-
der. The hurry in which they live, and
thre embarraillnents with which they are
f~rt~ounded,keep their Spirits. in pqrpetual
ferment. Confiaing with difficulties wh~ich
they are unable to overcome, conscious of
their own mifconduit, but aihamed to con-
fess it, they are engaged in many a feeret
firuggle;. and the uneafinel~s which they
fulffer within, recoils in bad humour on all
who are around them. H~ence the wvretched
resources to which, at last, they are obliged
to fly, in order to quiet their cares. Iq
delpair of being able to unravel what they
have fuffered to become so perplexed, they
sometimes fink into supine indolence, fomec
times throw thems~elves into the arms of

tribution ofyour time. Time you ought to , *
confider as a facredl truit committed to you
by God, of which you are now the de-
politaries, and are to render account at the
last. T~hat portion of it~ which he has
allotted you, is intended partly fo~r the con-
cern~s of this ~world, partly for those of thae
next. Let each of there occupy, in the dif--
tribution of your time, that space which
properly belongs to it. Let notthe hours
of horp~itality and pleasure interfere with
the dis~charge of your neceffairyy affairs; and
let not what you call necessary affairs, en-
croach uponl the timne which is due to devo-
tion. To every thipng thee is a fgon, and
a time for every purrpoSp uder the heaven*.,
If you delay till to-morrow what ought to
be done to-day, you over-charge the mor-
row with a burden which belongs not to it.
You load the wheels of time, and prevent
It from carrying you~along Cmoothly. He
whno ev-ery mornings plans the tranfaitionls

SER~ M. of the day, and follows out that plan, carries

c~ on a· thread which will guide him through

the labyri~nth ofthe most busy life. ~The orQ
dterly arrangement of his time is like a; ray rof
light which darts itself through all` his affairs.
But where no plan is laid,. where the difpo-
fal of timne is fu~rrendtered mer-ely to the
chance of incidents, all things lie huddled
together in one chaos, which admits neither
of diffriburtion no·r review.

The first requisite for introducing order

into the management of time, is to be im-
pre·ked with a juff sense of its value. Con-
fider w~ell how much depenlds upon it, and
how fast it flies away. The bulk of men
are in nothing more capricious and incon-
fillent than in their appretiatiotn of time.
WFhen they think of it as the measure of
their continuance on earth, they highly
prize it, and with the greatest anxiety seek
to lengthen it out. But when they view
it in separate parcels, they appear to hold it
in contempt, and s~quander it with incon*
ciderate profusion. Wjhile they complain
that life is thort, they are often withing its

different

different periods at 'an end. ~Covetous of ss~a I.
every other poffeffion, of time only they are
prodigal. They allow every idle man to be
master of this property, and make every
frivolous occupation welcome that can help
them to onf~ume it. Among those who ar
so careless of time, it is not to be expeded
that order thould be observed in its diffri-
bution. B3ut, by this fatal neglea, how
many materials ·of severe ~and lataing regret
are they laying up in flore for themf~elves!B
The time which they f~uffer to pass away la
the mnidf% of conlfufion, bitter repentance
seeks afterwsards i~n vain to recal. W8~hat
was omitted. to be done at its proper mo-,
ment, aIrif~es to be the torment of some fe-
tture season. Mdanhood is disgraced by the:
consequences of negleaed youth. Old age,
oppressed by cares that belonged to a former
period, labours under a burden not its own.
At the cllofe of life, the dying man be-
holds with anguilh that his days are finish-
ing, when his preparation for eternity is
hardly commenced. Such are the effe61s
of a disorderly wraite of time, through not

attending

SER M. attending to its value. Every thing in the

1..life of uch persons is milplaced. Nothing

i~s performed arighRt, frorn not being per-
formed i~n duek season.

But he who is orderly in the diitribution

of his time, takes the proper method of
refeaping thaofe manifold evils. He isjuftly
aid to redeem the time. By proper manage-
mnent he prolongs it. HEe lives m~uch ina
little space; more in a few years than
others do in many. He can live to God
and his own foul, and at the fam~e time at-
tend to all the lawfu~l interests of the prefeat
world. HC-e looks back on the past, and
prozvides. for the future. Hie catches and
arrests the hours as they fly. They are
marked down for useful purpol~es, and their
memory remains, Whereas those hours
fleet by the man of confusion like a thadow.
H-is days and years are either blanks of
which he has no remembrance, or they are
filled up with s~uch a confus~ed and irregular
$uc~cefiTon of unfienifhed tranfartions, that
though he remembers he has been bury,
yet he can give no account of the business

*9 which

which has employed him. ·Of him, monre~ SER 1IVL
than of an~y other, it mayT wlith jufitice be
pronounc~ed, that h e walketh5 iz a3 rvainfzew;

III. INJTRODUCE order into the manage-

m~nent of your fortune. WThatever it be, ltet
the adminiffration of it proceed with mne-
thod! and aeconomy. Fro~m time to time
exaunne your Stuation ; and proportion
your expenee to your growing or dimin~ih-
mng revenue. Provide what is necessary,
before you indulge in what Is superfl~uous.
Study to do juffice to all with w~hom ·you
deal, before you affeL the prais~e of libera-
lity. In a word, fix fLoch a plan of.living
as you find that your circumlaftances will
fair-ly admit, and adhere to it inv~ariablyT
against every temptation to improper ex-
ces~s.

No admonition refpeaing morals is more

necessary than this to the age in wvPhich we
live; an age manifeftiy diftinguEifhed by a
propenity to thoughtless profurion ; where-
in all the dinffere~nt r~anks of~ ien are obferv-

4 ER M. ed to press with forward vanity o~n thef'd

ac~h~s Who are above them; to vie with their fua

periours in ·everyt mode of luxury and Often-
tation; anid to s~eek no farther argument soar
justifying extravagance, than the falhion of
the times, and the s~upposed niecefit~y of
living like others around them. ' this trurd
of mind begets contempt for sober and or-
derly plans of life. It overthrows all re-
gard to domefici concerns and duties. It
pushes men on to hazardous and viflonary
schemes of gain; and unfortunately unites
the two extremes, of grasping with rapaci-
ouf~ner~s, and of s~quandering with profusion.
In the midrt of such disorder, no prosperity
can be ·of long continuance. WVhile con-
fuflon grows upon men s affairs, and pro-
digality at the fame time wastes their fubt--
flance, poverty makes it advances like an
armaed man. TFhey tremble at the vriew of
the approaching evil; but have loss the
force of mind to make proviflon against it.
Accuitomned to move in a round of society
and pleas~ures difproportioned to their con-
dition, they are unable to break through

Ithe

the enchantments of habit; and with their S ER M.
eyes open finkb into the gulph which is be-
fore thems. Poverty. enforces dependance;
and dependance increases corruption. N~e-
cellity firR betrays them into mean ~com-
pliarnces; next, impels them to open crimes;
and beginning wi~th oiaent~ation and extra-
vagance, they end in infamy and guilt.
Such are~ the consequences of negleaing
order in our worldly circumfltances. Such
is the circle in which the profure and the
difflute daily run.----To what caule, so
muceh as to thlte ~anat of order, camn we athtri-
butae tthofe fenes--of~ difreifs which so fre-
quently excite our pity; farmhles that once
were flourithing reduced to ruin; and the
melancholy widow and negleaed orphan
throwsn forthi, friendless, upon the wJorld ?
Wdhat caul~e has beean more friuitfual in en-
gendering thos~e atrocious crimes which fi~l
society with di~qluiet and terroxtr; in training~
the gamneffer to fraud, thae rokbber to violence,
and e~ven the aj~affin to blood ?

Be saffixed, then, that order, frugality,

and ceconomy, are the necessary supports of

4* every

sE wR Meevery' personal arnd private virtue. Hof~w

IV.S OBSERVE order in youir amnufemnents; S E M.

'that is, allow them no more than their pro-
per place; fludy to keep them within due
bounds : mingle them in a temperate fuc-
cetiion writh serious duties, and the higher
business of life. 1-luman life cannot proh
ceed to advantage without some meas~ure of
relaxation and entertainment. We require
relief from caret Wie are not formed for a
perpetual firetch aS serious thought. By
too intense and continued application, our
feeble powers would soon be worn out. At
the fame time, from our propeality to ease
and pleasure, amulement proves, among all
ranks of men, the mgoft dangerous foe to
order. F~or it tends inceffagntly to ourp and
encroach, to wmiden its territories, to thrust
its~elf into the place of more important
concerns, and thereby to diflurb and coun-
tera61 the natural course of things. One
frivolous amulement indulged out of season,
will often carry perplexity and confusion
throg- long fisecefi~on of affairs.

Amusements, therefore, though they be

of an innocent kind, require fleadiy go-

.an a M. vernmaent, to kreep thern within a due and

" limited province. But such as are of an

irregular and vicious nature, are not to be
governed, but to be baanihed from every
'orderly society. As soon as a man seeks
his happine'fs from the g~aming-table, the
midnight revel, and the other haunts of li-
centioufn~ers, confusion seizes upon him as
its own. There will no longer be order in
his family, nor order in his affairs, nor or-
der in his-time. The moRt important con-
cerns of life are abanldoned. Even tlhe order
of nature is by such persons inverted ; night
is changed into day, and day into night.
C~harafter, honour, and intereRt itself, are
trampled under foot. You may with cer-
tainty prognoticate the ruin of there men
to be juR at hand·. Difordler, arisen to its
height, has nearly accomplished its work.
The spots of death are upon them. Let
every one who would eitcape the pei~ilen-
tial contagion fly with hadte from their
company.

der in his life who allots not a due share of
his time to retirement and refle~tion. He
can iteitEher. prudeutly arrange his temporal
affairs, nor properly attend to his Spiritual
interests. He lives not to himself, but to
the world. By continual dissipation, he is
rendered giddy arid thioughtlefs. He uE n-

It is not a fbufficient prese~rvative against

this evil, that the circles of society in which
you are engraged are not of a libertine and
viciouIs kind. If ·they withdraw you from
that attention to yours~elves, and your do-

~~J carried to exceib ; an idle, trifling society is

near ~a-kin to s~uch .as is corrupting : One
of the firit principles of: order is, to learn to
be happy at home.. It is in domestic re-
treat that every wife and virtuous man finds
his chief f~atisfgaion. It is there he forms
the plans which regulate his public condue.,
Hie who knows not how to enjoy himself
when alone,csan never be long happy abroad.
To his vacant mind, company may afford
a temporary relief ; but: when forced to re-
turn to himnfelf, he will be to mu~ch Imore
oppressed and languid. W~lhereas, by a due
znixtiare of public and private life, we keep
free from the soares of both, and enjoy each.
to greater advantage.

WH~EN We review those different parts of

beha·viour to wrhiclh I have thaewn that orderr
is essential, it must necessarily occur to you
that they are all mutually conne~ted, and
hang upon each other. Throughout your
affairs, your time, your expence, your
amulements, your society, the principle of

order

order muit be equally carried, if you ex- SER M.
peat to reap any of its happy fruits. :For '
if into any one of those great departments
of life you fufifer disorder to enter, it will
[pread through all the reft. In vain, for
initance, yoru purpole to be orderly in the
conduat of your affairs, if you be irregular
in the diffribution of your time. In vain
you attempt to regulate your expence, if
into your amulements, or your society, dif-
order has crept. You have admitted a
principle of confullon which will defeat all
your plans ; and perplex and entangle what
yubu foght to arrange. U~niformity isabove
all things necefary to order. If you desire
that any thing thould proceed according to
method and rule, let all things, as the text
exrhorts, be done ina order.

I muRP also admonish yrou, that in fmnall

as wmell as in great affairs, a due regard to
order is requisite. I mean not that you
ought to look on those minute attentions
which are apt to occupy frivolous minds,
as conneaed either wr~ith virtue or wifdjom.
13ut B exhort you to remember, that difT

C 4 or der,

SER M. order, like other immoralities, frequently

-,,,. .... takes rife from inconsiderable beginnings.

They wrho, in the leff~ear tranfaaianss of life,
are totally negligent of rule, will be in hac
zard of extending that negligence,. by de-
~grees, to fulehi affairs and duties as will ren-
der themP crimninal. RWemiffnelrs grows on
all who fludy not to guard against it; and
it is only by frequent exercise that the ha-
bits ~of order and punauality can be
thoroughly confirmed.

Faolv what has been said, the great im-

porftance of this principle to moral' and reli-
gious conduat ruit already be evident.
Let: us, however, conclude, withi taking a
·summary view of the advantages which
attend it.

Firfk~, the obfervabnce of orfder s~erves to

corred that negligence which makes you
omit some duties, and that hurry and pre-
cipitancy which make you perform others
imperfealy. Your attention is thereby di-
reded to its prop~er objeas. YSou followl the
Araight path which Providence has pointed

out

out to moan; in the course of ~which all the SER M,
different bufinefh of life presents itlelf regu- q
]arly to~hirn on every fide, God and roan,
time and eternity, Ipoffef~s their proper fla-
tions, arise in fuacceiron to hlis view, andl
attrad~ his care. Wi~hereas he w7(ho runs on
in a disorderly cours~e, speedily involves
himself in a labyrinth, where ]he is ~fur-
rounded with intricacy and darknels. The
crooked paths into which .he firikes, turn
him aside from the proper line of human
pursuit; hide from his fight the objeas
which he ought chiefly to regard, and bring
others under his view, ws~hich s~erve no pur-2
pofCe but to diffra8 and mislead him.

Next, by attending to order, you avoid

idleness, that mnof: fruit~ful source of crimes
and evils. Aa~ing upon a plan, maeeting
every thing in its owq place, you conflantly
find innocent and uleful employment for
timne. Yo~u are never at a loss how to dif--
pose of your hours, or to fill up life agree-
ably. 10 the cours~e of human a~ion, there
are twro extremes equally dangerous to vir-
tue; the multiplicity of affairs, and the

C 4 total

SE R M. total want of thema. T~Hhe m1·an of order

1' fla~nds in the middle betwreen these two

ext~remes, and f~ufers from neither. ei
occupied, but not oppressed. Whereas the
disorderly, overloading one part of time,
and leaving another vacant, are at one
period overwhelmed with business, and at
another, either idle through want of em-
ployment, or indolent through perplexity.
Th~of-·ean eaosof indolence and ,idlened-s,
which recurfo ob step la their life, are their
rnoR dangerous moments. The mind, uln-
happy in its situation, and clinging to every
obje~t which can occupy or amuse it, is
then apteft to thrown itself into' the arms of
every vice and every folly.

Farther, by the preservation of order,

yg~ou check inconflancy and levity. Fickle
3by nature is the human heart. It is fond
of change; and perpetually tends to flart
aside from the fkraight line of conduet.
H3ence arife~as the propriety of' bringing our-
selves under fubjedion to method and
rule; ~whichm,'though at firfk it may prove
confitaining, yet by degrees, and from the

experience of its happy effeats, becomes SER IV£
natural and agreeable. It reaifies those irre- b~-
gularities of temper and manners to which
we give the name of caprice; and which
are distinguishing charaderiitics of a difor.-
derly mind. It is the parent of fleadinefs
ofcondua. It forms confiitency of cha-
ra~ter. It is the ground of all the con-
fidence we repole in one another. For, the
diso~rderly we know not where to find. In
him only can we place any truss who is
uniform and regular; who lives by prin-
ciple, not by humour; who aats upon a
plan, and not by desultory motions.

The advantages of order hitherto mena-

tioned belong to reditude of condna.,
Confider also how important it is to your
felf-enjoyment and felicity. Order is the
source of peace; and peace is the highest
of all temporal blessings. Order is indeed
the only region in which tranquillity dwells.
The very mention of confusion imports
di~turbance and vexation. Is it possible
for that mran to be hmappy, whfo cannot look
into the slate of his affairs, or the tenor of

SE Rnr M. is cond~uft, without discerning all 'to be
a..... '..... emb~roiled; wrho iseither in themntid ie of

r~emorse for what he has negleaed to do,
or in the midit of hurry to overtake what
he finds, too late, was necessary to have
been done ? Such as live according to or-
der may be compared to the celeffial bodies,
whbich move in regular courses, and by
Aated laws; whrole $nfluence is beneficent;
w~hose operations are quiet and tranquil.
The disorderly resemble those tumultuous
elements on earth, which, by s~udden and
viole~it irruptions, diflurb the cours~e of
nature. By mitmnanagemnent of affairs, by
excels in- expence, by irregularity in the
indulgence of company and amuiement,
they are perpetually creating Vnoleflation
both to themselves and others. They de-
part from their road to seek pleas~ure; and
inficad of it, they every where raise up
sor-rows. Beings always found out of their
proper place, they of course interfere and
jar with others. The disorders which they
rais~e never fail to fpreadl beyond their own
line, and to involve many in confusion

aand

and diff refs; whence they necessarily hE- SETR M,
conme the authors of tumult and contention, ·ai
of discord and enmity. Whereas order is
the foundation of union. It allows every
man to carry on his own affairs without
cliflurbing his neighbour. It is the golden
chain, which holds together the societies of
mnen in ~frientdfhip and peace.

In1 fine, the man of order is conne~ted

waith all the higher powers and principles
in the universe~. He is the fosllower of God.
He walks with him and aas upon his plan.
HPis chara~aer is formaed on the spirit which
religion breathes. For religion in general,
and the religion of Christ in prarticular, may
be called the great: discipline of order. TBo

Iby this inspired writer, there is nonle

which des~erves greater regard than that
contained in the text. Its importance,
howpever, is too seldom perceived by the
generality of men. They are apt to cona-
fider the regulation of external condua as
the chief objea of religion. If they can
aa their part with decency, and maintain
a fair charaater, they conceive their duty to
be fulfilled. What passes in the mean time
within their mind, they fuppole to be of no

great

SI:M- great confeiquence either to themselves, ofi
~ to the world. In opposition to this dan-

gerous plan of morality, the trrife man ex-
horts us to keep the heart; that is, to attend
not ofaly to our altions, but to our thoughts
and d ~es irs; and kheep the heart weith all
dihgence, that is, with s~edulous and unre-
mitting care; for which he afligns this
reason, that, oudt of the heart are the ifues
of I~f'e.--In discoursing on this fubjea. I
purpose to confider, separately, the .govern-
maent· of the thoughts, of the paf~ions, and
of the temper. But before entering on any
of ther~e, let us begin with .enquiring;, in
what sense the ifues of A~fe are said to be out
ofrthe hea~rt; that we may dik~cern the force
of the argument which the text suggests, to
recomlmend` this great duty o'f kee~ping the
hecaart.

The ifues of· hfe are jus fly said to be out

of the heart, becaule the slate of the heart
is whtat determkines our mroral charafter,
and what forms our chief happines~s or
mxf~ery.

determines our mgoral· chara~ter. The te- h
hor of our adions will always corres~pond
to the difpoijtions that prevail within.
To $diffmble, or toc fupEprefs them, is a fruit-
less attempt. In ipite- of our efforts, they
will perpetually break forth in our beha-
viour. On whatever fide the weight of
inclination hangs, it will draw the pradtice
after it. In vain therefore you study to
pres~erve your hands clean, unless you re-
solve at the fame time, to keep your heart
pure. M~ake th7e tree good, as our Saviour
direas, and thenr its frulits will7~ be good apf~.
For out' of th~e heart proceed' not only -evil
t~houghts, but murders, adulter·ies, jbrasica-
tions, theft, fape witne;s, blaff hemies *. . If
that fountain be once poisoned, you can Y

1f pendent of ail, agtion, it; is, i5n truth, the

stat~e of the hteart itlelf which forms our
charat~er in the fight of God. WJith our
fellow-creatures, saeions mutt ever hold the
chief rank; becau~se, by these only we can
u~d e of one another; by these we effedk
each othe's, welfare; and ~therefore to these
alone the regulation of human law extends.
But in the eye of that Supreme Being, to
whom our whole internal frame is uncover-
ed, dispositions hold the place of adions;
and it is not to much what we perform, as
the motive which moves us to perform-
ance, that .conititutes us good or evil in
his fight. Even among men, the mora.
lity of .a~tions is effimated by the principle
from which they are judged to proceed;
and s~uch as the principle is, such is the
mlan accounted to be. One, for inflance,
mnay s~pend much of his fortune in charit-
able aations ; and yet, if he is believed to be
·influaenced by mere ostentation, he is deem-
ed not charitable, but vain. H;e may la-
bour unwe~ariedly to fr rve the public; but

if he is prom~pted by the deGre of rising SER NIV
into power, he is held not public piriited, i
but ambitious i And if hee beffow~is a bene-
fit, purely that 'he may receive a greater Exi
return, no ·man would reckon him gene~-
rous, but f~elfifh and interefled. if reafoo.
thus -clearly teaches us to effimnate time value
of adions by the dispositions which give
them birth, it is an.olvious concluhon, that,
according to "tho~e· difpolitions, we are ail
ranrked and classed Oby him who feeth into
every heart. The reaification of our prin-
ciples of adion is the primary objedt of
religious dilcipline; and, in proportion as
this- is more or less advanced, we are more:
or less religious. Accordingly, the rege-
neration of the heart is every where repre-
fented in the Golpel as the mnof eifentiail
requifxte in the charadter of a Carifti~an.

SECONDLY, the slate of the hseart not

only determines our moral charader, but
forms our principall happiness or mnifery.

cS-~Jpinefs, or our mis~ery. Besides this power-

full argu~ment;E for kAeeping thle heart weith rall7
dik~gensce, .I must mnnrtion another~import-
ant' consideration taken from the .prefCeat
slate of human nature.- Think what your
heart now is, and what must~ be the confe-
quence of remitting your vigilance in watch-
ing over it. Wdith too rnuch juffice it is
said in s~cripture, to be deceitfu~l above all
thJings, and dcperatcly wicked. Its bias of
innate corruption gives it a perpetual ten-
dency downwards into vice and disorder.
To direQ and impel it upwards, requires a
conflant effort. Experience may convince
you that almost every desire has a propen-
fity to wander into an improper direaion;
that: every pafflon tends to excelfs; and that
around your imagination there perpetually
crowds a whbole fw8harm of vaina and cor-
ruptingr thoughts. ACfter all the care that
can be beffowed by the best men on the
regulation of the heart, it frequently bas-
fles their` efforts' to keep it under propei
dis~cipline. Into. whaat universal tumult

then must it rife, if no vigilance~ be- eie S~ER IV.

Over it ? Inattention and remithnefs is all

fires, in order to gain full advrantage.;
While you feesp, he Sowes his .tares ina the

and unguarded, he pres~ently garnifles reith5

Add to this, that the human temper is

to be considered as a f~yfftem, the parts of
which have a mutual dependance on each
other. Introduce diforder' into any one
part, and you derange the whole. Suffer
but one pafiron to go out of its place, or
to acqu~ire an unnatural force, and presently
the balance of the foul will be broken; its
powers will jar among themselves, and their
operations become dircordant.--Keep thy
heart, therefrre, *with all dihigence ; for all
thny diligence is here required. And though
thine ow~n keeping alone wpill not avail,
unless the afiftance of a higher power cont
cur, yet of this be well ass~ured, that no

]HAvrnv now thewn the importance of!

exrcifing government: over t'he heart, I
proceed to confider more particularly in
wvhat the government consists, as it· re-
CPefts the thopughts, the paffirons, and the
temper.

I begin wbith the thoughts, wvhich are the

prime movers of the wrhole human condu £,
All that makses a figure onl the great theatre
of the world, the employments of the bury,
the -enterprises of the ambitious, and the
exploits of the warlike, the virtues which.
form the happinelsi, and the crimefs which

eaticaon the mriieryr of mankind, originate

an that file'nt and iecret recers of thought
~whfich is hidden from every human eye.
The f'ecrecy and silence which reign theie,
favour the prejudice entertained by too
mnany, that thoughts is exempted from alj
controul. ~' Paffidns, theyr perhaps admit,

they are violexit e~oitions, ~and diflurb so-

no one is concerned. By these, sps1n asc
they remain in their bosom, natoffence can
be givien, and ppR injury committe~d. To
enjoy~ unreftraippy! the fill rage ofp aiot ~i.
nation, appears to thqq? day nativ. rijght
and privilege of pra~n.

·Had they to do with none but their

fellow-creatures, s~uch reasoning might be
[pecious. 'But they ought to remember,
that in the fight of the Suprepay Beinga
thoughts bear the charader of good or evilT
as much as adtions; and that tbey· are, iq!
especial manner, the fubjeas· of Divine ju-
rifdiation, becaule they are cognizable at
no other tribunal. T~he morpal regulatioq)
of our thoughts, is the particular~ test of our
reverence for God. If we reitrain our par
flons ~from1 breaking forth inty open difor-
ders, while we abandon oum-r imragipation
in s~ecret to eprnaption, we thew that virtue
rests with us ppon regard to m-en; and

Rrit- impulse t6 every principle of ation.

tertain is ·this, that to jiudge with precii~on

3Brr, supposing us convinced of its im- S·ER IV£

portance, a question may arise, How far i~t wf
is within our power, and in what dlegree·
thoughts are fubjedt to th'e commP~and of the
will ? It is plain that they are· not alwvays
the OFspring of choice. Often they are 16-
evitably impressed upon the mind by fur-
rounding objeats. Often they flart up, as
of themselves, without any principle of in-
trodu~tion which we are able to trace. A

canji not Itell wh~ence it cdometh5, nzor whbithjer
it goeth;` equally rapid in its-tranfitions, ·and
inferutable in its progrels, is the course of
thought. Molving alon~g a train of connec-
tions which are too delicate for our ob-
servatio~n, it defeats all endeavours either to
explore or to flop its path. Hence vain
and fantastic imaginations sometimes break
in upon the most fettled attention, and di'if-
turb even the devout exercis~es of pious
minds. Instances of this fort muff be placed
to the account ofhunan frailty. They are
misfortunes to be deplored, rather than
onimes to be conrdemned; and our gracious

per government of thought; and a niulti-
tqde of cales occur, in which we are no less
accqUptable for what we think, than for
what wte do.

As,. first, when the introduaion of any

train of thought depends upon ours~elves
and is our voluntary aat; by turning our
attentionl tow;ards fi~ch stbjeas, awfaken-
ing fiuch patlions, or engagigg in fach em-
ployments, as we know must give a pecul
liar determination to our thoughts. N~ext,
when thoughts, by whatever accident they
may have been originally fugg~efied, are in-
dulged with deliberatio~n and complacency.
Though the mind has been passive in their
reception, and therefore free from blame;
yet, if it be salve in their continuance, the
guilt becomes its own. T~hp may have
int~rud~ed at firlk, like unbidden guelts; but
if, when enteryd, they are made welcome, aLnd

and kindly entertained, the' cfe is thie farnq SER M,
a6 if they had been invited fromd the begin- $iesaB
nring. If we be thus accountbl~e to God
for thoughts either voluntarily ihtroducedl,
or deliberately indulged, we stre no less fb,
in the las1 place, for those which find ad
mittance into our' hearts from supine negli-
gence, from total relaxation! of attentionj
from allowing our knagination to rove with
entire licence, like the eyes of the fool, tCo-
wanrds thec end of the earth. ~Ourr minds
are, in this cafe, thrown open to folly and
vanity. They are proffituted to every evil
thing which ple~es to take poffPefiion. The
cons~equences must: all be charged to our ac-
pount ; and in vain we plead excuse~ froma
human infirmity. HEence it appears, that
the great objeat at which we are to airn in
governing our thoughts, is, to take the mnoft
efFeaual mneaf~ures for preventing the intro.
duetion of such as are sinful, and for haflten-
ing their expulflon, if they shall have intro-
duaced thems~elves wvitlhout codnent of thae wnill.

they g~ive to fancy ; and that too, for most
par~t, without remorse. Since the time that
Reason began to exert her powers, Thought
duiring our waking hours, has been a~tive
in every breast, withiout a moment's sus-
penflon or pause~. The current of idea's
has been always flowinlg. The wheels of
the spiritual entgine hav~e circulated with
prerpetual mnotiori. Let mre afkr, what has
been the fruit of thiis incefiant zaivity wlith
the greatest part of mankind ?Of the in-;
numarerable hours that have been employed
in thought, how few are marked with any
permanent or of~eful effea ?l How many
have either passed away in idle dreams; or
have been abandoined to anxious difc~on-
tented mufmg~s, to unsocial and malignant
pafllons, or to irregular ,and criminal de3-
fires ? Had I power to lay open· that flore-
houle of iniquity which the hearts of too
mainy conceal; could I draw out and read

to them a liiR of all the imagig ations thtey: s-E A M.
have devifedl and a.11 the patiions,they have ,;3
indulged in ifecret·; what a. piichtre of men
would I prefeat ~to- them selves ! W2ha~t -criates
would they appear to_ have perpetrated, inc

panions they dulrft not reveal!i

Evenl when men imagine their thoughts

to be innocently employed, they too, com-
monly fuffer them to run out into extrava-
gant imaginations, and chimerical plans of'
wrhat they would with to~attain, or choos~e to
be, if they could framne the coorde of things
according to their desire. Though fixcl

degful direationf, -your firlt care must ·be, to
acquie the p~ower -of--fixing them, and of
r~estraining heir irregular motions. Inure
ywourelves -to-fortn a plan ~of proper teedi-
tation ; to purs~ue~ it e-adily; and with fe-
vtere authority to keep the door that against
intrusions of wtarderinga fancty. Let your
mind, ~for trhis purpose, - beome a frequent

" axly present and- future pea~ce ? If they
"L are not, to what purpol~e do I indulge
"b such unpprofitable or dan~gerous mufingy ?'
-By frequent exercise of this inward focru-
tiny, we might gradually bring imagination
under discipline, and turn the powers of
thought to their proper use as means of im-
provement, instead of ~ufFer-ingS th~em to be
only the infiruments of vanity and guilt.

IN the s~econd place, in order to the go-

vernment of thought, *it is necessary to.guard
against idleness. Idleness is the great fa-
mnentor of all corruptions in the humah
heart. In particular, it is the operent of
lool~e imaginations and inordiinate desires.
The ever adive and refilefs powerufthoulght,
if not emnployed about what is good, w~ill
naturally and unavoidably engender evil.
Imagine not that mere occupation,, of wbas..

.~ ever

ever kind it be, wvill exempt you from the s M.~
blame and danger of an idle life. Perhaps ·-r·
the worit species of idleness is a diflipated,
though seemingly busy life, Cpent: in the
haunts of loose society, and in the chafe of
perpetual amusement. Hence a giddy mind,
alternately elated and dejeaed with trifles,
occupied with no recolletiorn of the past
but what is fruitleis, and with no plans~for
the future but what: are either frivolous or~
guilty.

As, therefore, you would govern your

thoughts, or indeed as you would have any
thoughts that are worthy of being governed,
provide honourable employment for the na-
tive adivity of your minds. Keep ]know-
ledge, virtue, and ufefulnlels, ever in view.
Let your life proceed in a train of such pur-
faJits as are worthy of a Christian, of a ra-
tional ansd faciall being. W~hile these are
reg~uaily carried on as the main business of
lifeC, let amulemnent poffeftsl no mrore thanm its
proper place in the diffribution of your time.
Take particular care that your amusements
be of an irrelproachable kind, and that all

VJoL. hII E your

sER M. pour foclety be either improving or inno-~

~ cent. So shall thefitream of your thoughts

be made to run in a pure channel. Manly
occupations and virtuous principles will ex-
pel the taint, which idleness never fails to
commzunicate to the vacant mind.

IN the third place, when criminal thoughts

aris~e, attend to all the proper methods of
speedily f~upprefling them. Take example
from the unhappy induffry which fiinners
difceover in banithing good ones, when a
Ilatural ifenf~e of religion forces them on their:
conscience. How anxiously do they fly
from themselves ? How fludioufly do they
dr9'wn the voice which upbraids them in
the nois~e of company or diversion~ ? What
numerous artifices do they employ to evade
the uneasiness which rfetu~rns of refle~tiona
would produce ?-Were we to us~e equal
dirigenice in preventing the entrance of vici-
ous ~fuggetions, or in expelling therm when
entered, why tlhould we not be eqa-ally s~ue-
cefrsful in a much better cause~ ?-As soon as
you are sensible that any dangerous paf~ion

begins

pafijons, and other idea~s, to your aid.. II1
Haften' to ttern your thoughts into a different
d~ireaion. Summon up wihatever you hwe@
found to be of power for composing and
harmonising your mind. Fly for affifaance
to s~erious findies, to prayer and devotion s
or evren fly tio business orinncn fcey
if solitude be in hazard of favouring the sea
duaion. By fhch means you may~top thi
progress of the growing evil. You may
apply an antidote, before the pbifori ha~s had
time to wTork its full effed.

IN the fourth place, it will be particularly

1Ifefunl tolimprefsy9our minds with an habitual
sense of the presence of the Almighty. Whena
w9e reflea what a firong check the belief of
divinle omniscience is calculated to give to
all criminal thoughts, we are tempted to
f~uipe%, that even byp Christians this article
of fa~ith is not mreevedT~ wit~h incelre convici
tion. For who but must: conf~ers, that if he
]knewm g parent, a friend, or a iteighbour, to·
have the power of looking into his heart,

E he.

sE M.

" he dur~it not allow himse~lf that unboundled

cd~hfcope which he now gives to his imagination

and desire ? Whence, then, comes it to pals,
that men, without fear or concern, bring into
the prelence of the awful majesty of Heaven
that folly and licentioufnels of thought which
wvould make _them bluth and tremble, if one
of their own fellow- creatures could defery it ?
At the fame time,· no principle is supported
by clearer evidence than the omniscience of
bod. All relig~ious fe £s have admitted it,
all societies of men, in their oaths and cove-
nants, appeal to it. The Sovereign of the
univers~e cannot but know what passes
th~roughout his dominions. He who s~up-
ports all nature must needs pervade and fill
it. H-e who form~ed the heart is certainly
conscious to what paiFes within it.

Never let this great article of faith efeape

from your view. In thinking, as well as
ie aating;, accuffom yourselves to look upl
with reverence to that piercing eye of di-
vyine osbfervation, which never juzmbers norp
Rieefps. Behold a pen always writing over
your head, and mlaking up that great re-

cord'

from which at lait you are to be judged, _1':

consequence than that of mankind. Let
there awful considerations not only check~s
the dilifpation of corrupt fknicy, but infuse
into your [~pirits that folema composure
which is the paren~t of meditation and wis~-
dom. Let 'them not only expel what is
evil, but introduce in its flead what is pure
and holy ; elevating your thou'ghts to div~ine
and eternal ojeas, ~anld aging as the coun-
terpolf~e to those attlraaions of the world,
which would draw your whole attentiog
49wowqards to fonf~e and vanitr,~

8 EU H AVING~I treated, in the foliegoing

s~~J difcourf~ie, of the government of the

thoughts, I proceed to con~der the govern-
ment. of the paffionss as the next great duty·
incl ud ed in the keeping of" the heart.

Passions are strong emotions of the mind,

occasioned by the view of apprehending
good or evil. TFhey are original parts of
the con~itution of ouar nature; andl there-
fore to extirparte them is a miitakep aim.
Religion requires noa more of us than to

mlnoderate

mnoderate and rule them. WNhen 'our~ brlef 8 ER IV.
ed Lord alrayned the nature, without the ~f
corruption, of man, he was fabje6 to like
passions with us. On some occasions he felt
the rilingsof anger. He was often touched
with pity. He was grieved in /Pirit; he
forrowed and he w~ept.

Paifions, when properly diredaed,· may

be faublervient to very useful ends. They
route the dormant powers of the foul.
They are even found to exalt them. They
often raise a man above himself, and ren-
der him more penetrating, vigorous, and
mrafterly, than he is in. his calmer hours.
A~uated by some high pafihon, he conceives
great designs, and s~urmounts. all difficulties
in the exuecution. H~e is inspired with more
lofty lentiments, and endowed with more
perf~ualive utterance, than he poffeff~es at
any other time. Pafflons are the adlive
~forces of the foul. Trheyi are its· highest
powers brought into movement and exer-
tion. But like all other great powers, they
are either useful or defiruaaive, according toP
their dire~tion and degree ; as wind and

E 4 fire

sS vt.fire are intlrumental irt carrying on many
c-~ of the beneficent operations of nature ; but

when they rife to undue violence, or i3te-
viate from their proper course, their path is
marked with ruin.

It is the present infelicity of human na-

ture, that those itrong emotions of the mind
are become too powerful for the principle
which ought to regulate them. This is one
of the unhappy consequences of our apof-
taly from God, that the influence of rea-
foa is weakened, and that of passion
Itrengthened within the heart. When
man revolted from his M~aker, his pafflons
rebelled againRt himself; and from being
originally the mniniiters of reason, have
become the tyrants of the foul. Hence, in
treating of this fubjea, two things may be
aiffimed as principles : firR, that through
the prelent weakness of the underitanding,
our- passions are often direded towvards itm-
proper objeats; and next, that even when
their direation is jubt, and their objeas are
mnnocent, they perpetually tend to run into
excess; they always hurry us towards their

grati-

gratification wvith a blind and dangerous SEaR M'
impetuoiity. On there two points then ~
turns the whole government of our passions :
first, ·to ascertain the proper obje~ts of their
purfauit; and next, to reitrain theni in that
pursuit, when they would carry us beyond
the bounds of reason. If there be any pas-
sion which intrudes itself uns~easonably into
our mind, which darkens and troubles our
judgment, or habitually dif~compofes ourt
temper; which unfits us for properly dif-
charging the duties, or dis~qualifies us fbr
cheerfully enjoying the comforts of life,
we may certainly conclude it to have gaine~d
a dangerous afcendlant. The great ·objet
which we ought to propoife to ours~elves is,
to acquire a frrm and fledfafe mind, which
the infatuation of pafflon shall not seduce,
nor its violence thake; which, resting on
fixed principjles, thall, in the midif of' con-
tending; emo~tions, remnain free and master
of itself; able to listen calmly to the voice
of conscience, and prepared to obey its dic-
tates writhout hesitation.

S E R M. T~Eo obtain, if possible, su~ch comm~n~d of

~ft~ plraffon, is one of the higheii attainments

of tlhe rational nature. Arguments to thew
its importance crowd upon us from every
qjuarter. If there be any fertile source of
muiichief to h'uman1 life, it is, .beyond doubt·,
the rnifrule of pafiron. It is this whichl
poisons the enjoyment of individuals, over-
turns the order of society, and firews the
·path of life with so many miser-ies, as to
render it indeed the valley of tears. All
those great feenes of public calamity, which
wJue behold wIith affonithment and$ horrour,
have -originated from the source of violent
]pafflons. These~ have overspread the earth
wNithP bloodshed. Thes~e have pointed the
affaffin's dag~ger, and filled the poisoned
bowl. Tkhere, in every age, have furnish-
ed too copious materials for the orator's
pathetic declamation, and for the poet's
tragical song.

When from public life we descend to

private condua, though pafflon operate not
there in fbuch a wide and deftruaive sphere,
we~g shall finbd its influence to be no le~ss bane-

~fu~l

ful. I need not mention the black anad 8 E M.
fierce pafirons, fach as envy, jealouly, an~d` pr~
revenge, whole effe~s are obviously now-
ious, and whole ag~itations are immediate
wifery. But take any of the licentious and
fenuPal kind. Suppose it to haveunlimited
hfope; trace it throughout its course; and
you will find that gradually, as it rifea, it
taints the soundness, and trocbles the peace
of his mind ovrer whom it reigns; that in
its progress it engages him in pursuits which
are marked either with danger or with
shame; that in the end it wastes his for--
tune, deffrorys his health, or debases his
chara~ter , and aggravates all the mis~eries
in w7hicha·i ithas irnvolvedf hia gwith the conm-
cluding pangs of bitter remors~e. Through
all the flages of this fatal course, how many
have heretofore run ? WKhat mnutitudles do
we daily behold purs~uing it, with blind and
headlong fleps ?

But, on the evsils w~hicha flow ifrom unrse-

firained passions, it is needles~s to enlarge.
Hardly are there any so, ignorant or incon-
fi~derate as not to admit, that where ]pafiTon

6 is

g E~I~- is allowed to reign, both happiness and vir-
bir~f~tue muRl be impaired. I proceed therefore

to what is of more consequence, to faggeft:
some direaions which may be diefil1 in
allifting us to pjreferve the governinent of
our pafirons.

IN the firR~ place, wre muRt fludy to ac-

quire juff views of the comparative import-
ance of those o~bjeas that are moRt ready to
attrad~ desire. Thke erroneous opihions
wNhich we form concerning happifnefs and
misery, give rife ~to all the initaken and
dangerous passions which em~broil our life.
WMe f~uffer ours~elves to be dazzledi by unreal
appearances of pleas~ure. We follow, with
precipitancy, whithersoever the crowd
leads. W~e admire, without ex-amination,
what our predeceifors have admired. W~e
fly from every sh~adow at which we fee
others tremble. Thus, agitated by vain
fears and deceitful hopes, we are hurriedl
into eager contests about objeats wvhich are
in themselves of no value. 3By redtifying
our opinions, we thould ~thike at the r~oot

of

of the evil. If our vain imaginations were SE R IV.
chastened, the tumult of our paflions would . "
fu b si & le.

It is observed, that the young and the

ignorant are always the most violent in
pursuit. The knowledge which is forced
upon themn by longer acquaintance with the
world, moderates their impetuosity. Study-
then to anticipate, by reflexion, that know-
ledg~e which experience often purchases at
too dear a price. Inure yourse~lves to fre-
quent -consideration of the emptines~s of
those pleasures which excite to much firife
and commotion among imankinad. T~hink
how much more of true enjoyment is 10ft
by the violence of paflion, than by the want
-of thofeP things which give occafian to that
pafflon. Persuade yourselves, that the fa-
vour of God and the poffeflion -of virtue
form the chief happines~s of the rational1
nature. Let a contented Inind, and a
peaceful life, hold the next place ine your
estimation. These are the conclusions
which the wife and -thinking part of man-
kHind have always formed. T~o there con-

B4 clufions,

SE~R 1V. clufions, after having run the race of pa@;

~ lr ~sion, you will probably come at the laira

By forming them betimes, you would make'
a seasonable escape frolm that tempeituous
region ; through which none can pass with-
out fuffering misery, contrasting guilt, and
undergoing severe remorse.

IN the recond place, in order to attain

the command of palilon, it is requdfite to
acquire the power of felf-deniali The self-
denial of a Christian consists not in perpe-
tual austerity of life, and universal renun-
clation of the innocent colmforts of the
world. ]Religion requires no such unne-
ceffary sacrifices, nor is any such foe to
prefentr enjoyment. It consists in OUr' being:
ready, ·on proper occasions, to abitain froma
pleas~ure, or to f~ubrnit to fuffering, for the
fake of duty and confrcience, or from a views
to some higher and more extensive good.
If we poilers not this power, -we ihall be
the prey of every loose inclination that
chances to arise. Pampered by continuall
Indulgence, all our passions will becoml

mwutingou

mutinouas and headfirong. Desire, not SER M.
reason, will be the ruling principle of our
condua.

As, therefore, you would keep your pas-

flons within~ due bounds, you must betimes
accufform themx to know~ thte reins. Youa
mnuft not wait till fomne critical occasion for
the exercjife of fellf-denial occur. In vaia
you will attempt to aQ with authority, if
your firfl; essay be made when temptation
has inflamred the mind. In cooler ho~urs,
you muff sometimes abridge your enjoy-
maent even of what is innocent. In the
midst of lawful pleasure, you muff main-
tain moderation, abl~emiourae~s, and felf"
comsmand. Thbe observance of this d~ifci-
pline is the only method of fu~pportingr rea-
son in its proper ascendant. For if you
allow yourselves always to firetch to the
utmaoft point of innocence and s~afety, be-·
yond that point you will infallibly be hur-
ried, when pafflon thall arise in its might to
fhta'ke the heart.

IN the third place, imnprel~s your minds

deeply- with this perfuaflon, that nothing is

wzhat

sER ivt. what it arppears to be when you are under

18.· the power of passion. Be assured, that no

judgment which you then form can be ia
the -least depended upon as found or true.
The fumpes which arise~ from a heart_ boiling
rwith violent pairons, never fail to darken
·and trouble the underfianding. Wthen the
gourd withered, under the shade of which
the prophet Jonah reposed, his mind, al-
ready ruf~edl by the disa~ppointment of his
predi'Qions, Ilot, on occaflon of this flight
incident, all command of itself; and in the
unidft of his impatience, he wzeiped to die ra-
ther- thcan to live. Inficad of being calmed
by'that expollulating voice, DofZ thou wcell,
O "fonab ! to be angr-y becauj2e of the gour~d.
he replied with great emotion, Ido welld to
be anagry event unto death. But d id Jonah
think so when his passion had abated ? D~o
these featiments bear the least: res~emblance
to that humble and devout prayer, which,
on another occafian, when in his calm mind,
he put up to God*? No two persons carl
differ mnore fr-om eachn other than the famne

by pafflon, and whene maite of his reason. ~~ia
I do welel to be, angry, is tl e language of
every man when his mind is inflamedb
Every passion juffifies~itfelIf. It brings in a
thousand pretences ~to ~its aid. It borrows
many a false cologbr to hide its deformity.
. It poffeffes a fort of~ magic, by which it can
magnify or diminish obojeas at pleas~ure, and
transform the appearance of every thing
wmithin its sphere.

Let the knowledge of this imposture vthiclx

]pafflon prat~ifes, place you continually on
your guard. Let the remembrance of it
be ever at haand, to check the extravagant
Ijudgments which you are apt to pass in
those m~omrents of· delulion. Lifld~en to no
fuggeftiona which then arif~ies. Forma no
conclusions on which you alre o a. As-
sure yourselves that every thing is beheld
through a false medium. Ha've patience
for a little, and the illusion will vanis~h;
the atmolphere will clear up around you,
and objeats return to be viewed in their na-
tive colours and just dimenflons.

V o 1.. I I. F Ia

if *~P~' I the Ed~uith place, oppolic early the be-
hcylJ.ginning of-pafflon. Avoid particularly all

such objefts as are apt to excite paffrons
which you know to predominat~e within
--you. As soon as you ·find the tempeit rising,
have recourse to every proper method, ei-
ther of allaying its violence, or of escaping
to a calmer £~hore. Hasten to call up emno-
tions of an opposite nature. Study to con-
quer one pafiron by: means of some other
which is of lef~is dangerous tendency. Never
account any thing limall or trivial which is
in hazard of introducing disorder into y'our
heart, Never make light of any delire
which you feel gaining foch progrels~ as to
threaten entire dominion. ]Blandifhing it
will appear at the firit. As a gentle and
innocent emotion, it may fleal into the
heart; but as it advances, it is likely to fierce
;you throulghwithb many f~rrpows. W~hat you
indulged as a favourite amuiement, will
thortly ·becorne a ferirous business; and in
the end mnay prove the burden of your life.

WMhere are they who once diflurbed .the
world with the violence of their contests,
and Eilled it with the renown of their ex-
ploits ? Whrat now remains of their designs
and enterprises, of their. pafflons and pur-
suits, of their triumphs and their glory ?
T~he flood of time ]has passed over them,
and fwyept them away, as if they had never
beent. The fajhion of th5e weorld changes
continually around us. We s~ucceed one
another in the human cours~e, like troops
of pilgruns on their journey. Abs~urdly we
fpend' our time in contending about the
trifles of a day, while we ought to be pre-
paring for; a higher existence. Eternity is
juff at hand to close this introdum~tory feene.

I5 It

It is fast~ rolling tp wards us, like the tig & E M.
of a vast ocegn, ready to fgallowr up all siir
human concerns, and to leave no trace be-
hinld it, except the consequences of our goodd
or bad deeds, which thall ladt fr ever.---
Let such refle~tions allay the heat of paiffon.
Let them reduce all hu~man thins to their-
proper flandard. From frivolous pursuits
let them recal our attention to objeas of
real importance;I to the proper business of
m-an; to the improvement of our nature,
the disc~harge of our duty, the rartional and
religious conduat of human life.

IN the laRt place, to our own endeavours

for regulating our paflons, let us join ear-
oeRt prayer to God. Here, if any where,
divine afirRance is requisite. ~ For s~uch is
the present blindne'f~s and imperfeition~ of
human nature, that even to difEcover all the
dilaxders of our heart is become dificult;
much more, to redtify them, is beyond our
power. To that fu~peripr aid, then, which
is promised to the pious and uprightn, let us
leook up with humble minds; befeching

F 3 tha

SERSiil the Fatiher oF mercies, that while we fl~udy
~-~I ·td aft oilr ba~i part with resolution and

vigilance, he would forgive our returning
Jk·a~knP4Gfwav~-la'bld'eng repgh our conflancy
i·Wf-;iefiftin~g thie affaildes: of pafflont; and
Ci9tble u's by- his grace to to govern our
kinrds, that without consid~erable interru -
tions we stay proceed in a courke of piety
and v~irtue.

IZr now remains to treatr of the govern-

rnent of temper, as included in the keepsinc
of~the heart. PafiTons are quick and fireng
emotions, which by deSree~s ub~ie. Tern-
per is the difpolition which remains after
thtere emotions are past, and which forms
the habitual proper fity of the foul. The pas-
flons are like th~e fireama when, it is fwvoln· by
the torr~eri, and ruffled by the winds. TIhe
temper reiembles it when running within
its bedc, with its natural velocity and force.
The influenlce of temper is more silent and
imperceptible thian that of passion. It ope-
pates with lefrs violence ; but as its operation
)s copitant, it ·produces' effeas no less con-

fid erableo

fiderable. It is evident, therefore, that it. s 4 M*
highly deserves to: be -ccnfidered· in agreli-
gsons vieqw,

SMany, indeed, are averse to behold it in
this light. They place agood temper apos
the fare footing: with a healthy conflirtu-.
tion of body. They confider it as a natural
felicity- which some enjoy; but for the wiant
of which, others are not morally culpable,
nor accountable to God; and hence the
opinion has s~ometimes prevailed, that a bad
temper might be confilent with a R~ate of
grace. If this were true, it would overturn
that whole do~riae, of which the golpel is
so full, that regeneration?, or change of na-
ture,· is the essential chara~terific of a Christ-
ian, It would fuppol~e that: grace utight
dwell amidit malevolence and rancour, and
that heaven mnight be enjoyed by fiich as
ar-e firangers to *charity and love.-I!t will
readily be admitted, that some, by the ori-
ginal frame of their mind, are maore favour-
ably inclined. than others towards certain
good' difpolitions and habits. :But this as-
f~ords no justification. to those who neglea
tp oppose the corruptions to w-hich they are

F 4.· prone.

a good man ought to be, with r'iIerpt to
Grod, to his neighbour, and to himself.

But they apply to thei-r duty through mere
confiraint; a-nd s~erve God without affeatio~n
Or complacency. Miore liberal and gene-
rous se~ntiments animate the mnan who is of
a devout temper. God dwells upon his
thoughts as a benefaaor and a father,. to
whole voice he hmearkens with joys Amidst
the occurrences of life, his mind naturally
opens to the admiration of his wi~sdom, the

-lSuch a temnper as this deserves to be cul~-
tivated: with the utmod; a~tternion; for it-
contributes, in a high degree, borth to our
imnprovement and our happiness. It refines,
and it ex~alts human natur-e. Iet soft~ens that~

traSe from frequent intercou~rt, with this
rugged world. It facilitates- the discharge
of every duty towards God- and man. At

mhany of the annoyances of worldly life.
When the temper is truly devout, the peace
of God ~whi'ch pagth ulnderfaldinag keepeth

SECONDLY, to point out the proper slate

of our temper with: refpedc to one another.

It is e~vident, in the general, that if' we: a8L
coanfut either pubic welfare or private·~~ hapr
pinefk,; Chriftia ch~arityr ouFght to regulate
our difpoliti~ar in mztrual laitercourfe. But
as ~this· great princ~ip~le admits of several di-
aerfified appearances, let us confider famen
oF the chief formans under wphich it ouigh~t tos
thew~ its~elf in the iuual tenour of· life. U7ni-
versal benevolene ~to mnankind, w7henl it
rests in the abftratd, is a loose in~determinate
~dea, rather than a priixciple of real effe& i
Asnd too often floats as an useless s~peculation
in- the head, inficad of affeaing the temper
afi'd the heart.,

W~hat first presents its~elf to be recorn-

anended, is a peaceable temper ; a difpoli-
tion a~verse to give offence, and desirous of
cultivat'ing harmony, and amicable ~interg
course in society. This fouppofes yielding
an~d condescending manners, imwililingners
to contend witbh others abouit trifles, and,
in contests that are unavoida~ble, proper mo-
deration of ifpirit. Such a temper is the
first principle o felf-enjoyment. It is the
basis of all order and happiners among

mnankind.

& EER Ive oa~nkind, The politive and contentious,

," .the rude and quarrelsome, are. the bane of

foolty.. The~y seem. destined* to blaflt~he
famll flrame of tcomfort which natue ha~a
here allotted to man. But they cannot dif-
sub the peace of othere,. mr~ep than they
break-their own. The hurricane rag~es, frit
~in their owat beo~m, btefore it·.is let: forth
upon the world. · In the ternpeits which
they raii-e, they .are always tofty and freT
quently it is their lot to perith.

A peaceable temnper muff· be fiPpported by

a ·candid one, or a difpoitiona to view the
conduat of others with fabirnefs~an~d impar-
tiality. This flands opposed to a jealous
and fufpiicious temper, which aleribes every
sal~on to the worst moative, and% throws a
black thade over every chazader.g AS you
wvould be happy in yourselves, or in your
conneations with others, guard against this
mnalignant spirit. Study that charity whitch
thinketht~ no evil; that t·emper whaich, with-
out degenerating into credulity, will difpole
you to be just:; and which can allow you
to observe an error, without imputing it ~as

a enime.

thit· crontinual irritation whEich imaginapl cjr i -~
injuanes raire rn~ a fufrpierous breast ; and woill
w~alk- amo~ng- men as~ your brethrenyinot ypour

B~ut to be peaceable, and ·to be candid,

is not all that is required of a good -man.
H~e munt cultivate a kind, generous,- and
sympathizing temper, which feels for dif=
tr~ess, w\herever it is beheld ; which enters
inrto the concerns of his fr-iends wplith ;ar-
doulr; and to :01l with wrhorm he -has inter--
course is gentle, obliging, and humanle.
Howr amiable appears such a -difpolition.,
wh~en contrasted with g amalicious· or envi-
cus temper, which wraps itself up in its
own narrow interest, looks with an evil eye
on the fauccefs of other-s, anad writh an unna-
tural fatisfa~tion feeds on their dilappoint-
mnents or miseries! H row little does he knowp

In itlelf a virtue, is at least the garb in:
whlich virtue thould be alw'ays arrayed.
Piety and goodness ought never to be mark-
ed with that dejeftion which sometimes
takes rif~e fromn fuperflition, but which is
the proper portion only of guilt. At the
farne time, the cheerfulness belonging to
virtue is, to be carefully diflinguiihed -from
that lighbt and giddy temper which charac-
terizes folly, and is so often found among
the dif~pated and vicious part of mankind.
T~heir gaiety is owing to a total want of
reflexrion; and brings with it the diual con-
Sequences of an unthinking habit, shame,
remorse, and heaviness of heart, in the end -
The cheerfulnels of a well-regulated mind
springs fromn a good -conscience and the fa-
vouur of Hjeaven, and is bounded by tem-
perance and r·eason. It makes a man·

habitual frame of mind, in a good man i
Devout towards God ; towards men, peace-
able, candid, affeaionate, and humane.;
within hims~elf, huimble, contented, and

happy temper, all the dire~tions which I
before fuggeited for the due'regulation of
the thoughts, and for the government of
the passions, naturally conduce ; in this they
ought to ifibe; and when this temper is
thoroughly formed within us, then may
the heart be eiteemed to have been kept
with aHl dihigence. That we may be thus
enabled to keep it, for the fake both of
present enjoyment, and of preparation for
greater happiness, let us earnetlyr pray to

of that supreme beat-it~ude,, which ·neithe~r
athe virtues nor. the crim~es -of mnen can in the
leaR affeft. From a motive of overflowing
goodness, he reared up the universe. -,As
the eternal lover of righteorilnefs, he; rules it.
The whole fcyftem of his government is
fixed; his laws are irrevocable; and, what
he once loveth,· he loveth to the .end. In
scripture,. indeed, he. is sometimes fagid to
be grievued and to repent. But such ·expref-
fions, it is obvious, are employed from ac-
commodation to common conaception; ine

d~ifporitin towards good and evil continues
the falme, but varies in its sppilication as its
ob~jeas vary; just as the laws thems~elves,
wrhichf are capablje of no c~hange of affe~ionm,

tion of it ought to produce on our mi3nde
and behaviouar.

It will be proper to begin this head of dis .

course by remroving an obj-eaion wmhich tie:
doc~rine I have ifhuifrated may appear to
form against rel~gIous services, and- in par-
ticular againR the duty of prayer. To wha~ite
gprpof~e, it may be urged, is homage ad-
d~ressed to a Being wh~ofie purpos~e is unal-
terably fixed; to whom ourp righteouf~nefi
extendPet not; whom by no arguments we
can persuade, and by no fupplicatiorns we
can mollify ? The objeationa would have
weight, if our religious addresses were de-
signed to work ;any alteration on God; ei--
ther by giving him information of what he
did not know; or by exciting affeations

w~hich

sE:R 1V which he did - not pof fef~; or by. inducing

,1V. .him to change meas~ures which he had pre-

vioufly formed. But they are only crude
and imperfea notions of religion which can
s~ugg~est fach ideas. The change which our
devotions are intended to make, is upon our-
selves, not upon the Almighty.. Their chief
efficacy is· derived from the good dis~positions
wmhich they raise and cherish in the human
foul. By pouring out pious s~entiments and
desires before God, by adoring his perfeec-
tion, and confeffing our own unworthiness,
by exprefirng our dependence on his aid,
our gratitude for his past favours, our fi~b-
million to his pres~ent will, our truss in his
future mrercy, we cultivat~e such affeations
as suit our place a~nd R~ation in the universe,
atnd are thereby prepared for becoming ·ob-
jets of the divine grace. Accordingly, fre-
quent assurance are given us in Scripture,
that the prayers of sincere wrorfhippers, pre-
ferred through the greiat M8/ediator, th~all be
produative of the happiest eff~eas. When
thkey aJf, they sPall receive ; whcten they f~ek,

W~hen religious homage is considered in

this 11 ht, as a' great infirument of firiitual
and moral improvem~ent, all the obje~tions
which fEepticifm can form from the divine
immutability, conclude with no more force
againflt prayer, than against every other-
m~ean of improvement which reason has
fuggefied to man. If prayer be superfluous,
becaule God is unchangeable, we might
upon similar grounds conclude, that it is
needless to labour the earth, to nourish our
bodies, or to cultivate our mninds, because
the fertility of the ground, the continuance
of our life, and the degree of our under-
flandinlg, depend upon an immutable So-
vereign, and were from all eternity fore-

proceed to thewr what sentiments the co~n-
templiation of divine imm~utability thould!
raige in *our minds, and what duties it lh~ould
cfhiefly enforce.

I. LET it excite us to admire and adorea

Filled~ writh pr ofound reverence, let us look
up to that Supreme Being who fits from
everlaffing on the throne of the universe;
moving all things, but remainung un~amove-
able himself ; direa~ing every revolution of
the creation, but aPffeaPed by no revolutions
of eivents or: of time. H3e beholds the he~avens

and

atnd the earth wreax old as a garment, and SI M-.II
d~~ecay l~ikea vefure. At their appo~inted pe-
r~iods he raises up, or he dissolves worlds.
But amidst all the convulflons of changing
and perishing nature, his glory and fe~lcity
remain unaltered.-TThe view of great and .
flupendouos objeas in the natural world
firikes the mnind wvith solemn awe. WShat "
veneration, then, ought to be inspired by
the conitemplation of an objea s~o fablime
as the eternal and unchangeable Ruler of the
ulnivierfe ! The contpfure andl f killnefs of
thought introduced by such a meditat~ion, has
a powerful tendency both' to purifyT and to
elevate the heart. It effaces, for' a timne,
those trivial ideas, ands eatinguithes those
low pafflions, which arif~ie from the circle of
rain and passing objeas around us. It opens
the Hmind to all~ the f~entriments of devotionl;
and accompanies devotion with that pro-
found reverence, which guards it fkomn every
improper excess. W7hen w~e confider the
Supreme Being as employed in wrorks of
love; when we think of his cond~efcedionn
to the hurtum~ race ini feldling his Son to

.I~dand warmed by g~ratitude, we are fometitnes

iq da~nger at prefupfing too much on his
goodgefs, and of indulging a certain fond-
ness of affeaion, which ~is unfamitable to our
humble and dependent Rate. It is necef-
fary that he thould frequenatly, appear to
our minds in all that majeity with which
the immutability of his nature clothes him;
in. order that reverence may be combined
with love, and that a mixture of s~acred swve
may cha~en the rapturous effufions of warm
cdevostion. Servile fear, inadeed, would crufha
the [pirit of ingenuous and affeationate ho-
aroage. But that reverence which springs
from elevated conceptions of the divine~na·-
turre, has a happy effed8 in checking the
forwardness of imagination, rear~aining our
afFeaLions writhin due bounds, and comg3pof-
ing our thoughts at the fame tione-that it
exalts them.,

Wi7henl, from .the adoration of the un-

changeable perfeaion of' the Almighty, we
return to t~he view of our own RIate, the- first
fentimeant which ought naturally to aris~e, is

that offerlf'-abafement. WSe are too apt to SER M.
be lifted up by any little diitinaions which I
we poeffes; and to fancy oturfelvs 'great,
only because there are others wvhodlm e con-
fider as less. But what is man, with allt his
advantages and boasted powers, before the
eternal Father of Lights 7 With' God there
is no variableness; with mat> there is no
flability. Virtue and vice divide the em-
pire of his mind; and wisdom and folly
alternately rule him. H~ence he is change-
able in his designs, fickle in his friendlhips,
fluauating in his whole clharader. Hlis
life is a series of- contradialonfs. H4e is one
thing to-day, and another to-morrow;
sometimes 0bliged by experience to alter his
purpore, and often led to change it through
levity. Variable and unequal himself, he
is surrounded with flieetingg objeats. ]aHe is
placed as in the midst of a torrent, where all
things are rolling by, and nothing keeps its
place. HIe has hardly time to contemplate
this feene of vicissitude, before he too is
fwrept away. Thus circurnitanced in him-
self, and in all the objeas with which he is

H-I 2 con-

8 ER M* conne~ted, let him be admonished- to be

icrcrhumble@ and modest. Let the contimpla-

t pn oz f the unchanging glory of his Creator
inspire him wgith fentimnents of due fubmif-
sion. Jlct it teach him to know his proper
plac~es. and chbeck that vanity which is so
readX eop stray him into guilt.

Let the fanse meditation affed him with

a dep s~ense of: what he owes to the good-
Refs ps the Peity. ]His g~oodaefs never ap-
pears in so ariking~b a light, as when viewed
in connexion with his greatnes~s. The de-
fai~ption whrich is g~iven of him in the text,
ecwlai, in this view, for our particular atten-
tion. It prefeats to us the moit amiable
union of equdfcenflon with majeity, of the
zmoral with the natural perfeaions of God,
wh~~tich ma~n pofflyfbl be exhibited to the imna-
gination ofmaan. Fromr the FathCer of Lighs,
wi~ath whome4E ther is no anriabl~enref, neither
}hadlowre ofturnin~g, comethrc down~p ever-y good

$ ER M. I17. LEzT the divine immutability become

e~s the ground of confidence and trust to good

menn, arnidft all the re~volutions of this un-
certain w7~orld. This is one of the chief im-
~provernents to be made of the fubjeat, and
therefore requaires full illuffration. TFhere
are three lights in which we may view the
henefit redounding to us from that attribute
o3f Godg w~hiCh we now confidler. It afrures
us of the conflancy of Nature ; of the regu-
lar admrainiffration of Providence; - of -the
certain accomplishment of all the divine
promnifes.

First, it gives ~us ground to depend on the

conflta~nt and uanifrorm couarfe of Nature. O
the unchanrgearblenefs of God rests the fla-
bility of the universe. W7hat wecall the
lawms of Nature are no other than th~e dcrees
of the Supreme Beinag. It is because He is
-withouC vUariablenefi or J73adoze~ of turninzg,
thaat those l;aws have continu~ed, the fame
since the beginning of the world;' tha.1 the
Sun so constantly obs~erves his time of rising
and going down ; that: the seasons annually
return; the tides periodically ebb and flow;

the

tche earth yields its fruits at Rtated intenrals g8ERM
and the human body and mental powera·
advance to maturity by a regular progress.
In· all. those motions and operations which
are incessantly going on throughout nature,
there is no Rtop nor interruption ,r no change
nor innovation; no defle~tion fromr -thei
main s~cope. The fame powerful and Rteady
'hand wohich gave the firRt impulse to the.
powers of Nature, re~trains thems front ever
exceeding theirr prefe~ribed line. HE-ence
aris~es· the chief comfort of our prefeat life.
Wae find ourselves in a regular and orderly-
wgorld. Wie look ~forwar6d to a krnown
fasccefiron of events. Wae are enal~ed8 to
form plans of adion. From the cause wre
calculate the effedt; and from the past,
we reason with-confidence conlcerning the
futgure.

Accustomed from our infancy to-this conl-

R~ancy in Nature, we are hardl~y fe~nfble of
the ble~fing. 1Familiarity ha~sthle fame efo
fedt here, as in many otherenjoyrments, to

take an opposite view of thaings. Let us

BU T thoughr the great laws of Nature he

44nlapt like their Author, yet in the
lffairs' of men there is much variety and
change. All that regard~sour prelent pof-
feifions and enjoyments ~was, for wife rea-
sons, left, in a great measure, uncertain.;
and from this uncertainty arises the difkref2s
of human life. - Sensible of the changes to
which we lie open, we look round wit~h
anxious eyes, and eagerly gralfp at every
objea which appears to promis~e us f~ecu-
rity. But in vain is the whole circle of
human things explored with this viewi.
There is nothing on earth so flable as to
af~bre us of undiiflurbed reft, nor so powesr-
ful as to afford us conflant prote~tion.
Tkime, dleathl, and chrange, trium pph over all
the labours off men. What we build9 up,
they incess~antly defiroy. T~he public con-
dition of nations, and the private fortunes of
iridividuals, are alike farbjeat to reverses.
Life neverpretains long the fame form. Its

a~i~ us. --BAmidft those endless vicissi~tudes,

what can give any firm consolation, any
satisfying reft to the heart, except the do-
minion of a wife and righteous Sovereign,
wrcith5 whom there is no variablenefj nor }hia-
dowe of turning ? Thou~gh all things change,
and we ours~elves be involved in the general
mutability, yet as long as there is fixed and
permanent goodness at the head of the uni-
verfek, we are aifured that the great inter~e'it
of all good men ihall be safe. That river
perpetually flows, the freams whebep~of make
glad the city of God. We' know that the
Suapreme Being loved righteousnes~s fromn
the. beginning of days, and .that he will-
continue to love it to the last. U~nder his
go0vernment none of those revolutions hap-
pen which have place among the kingdoms
of the earthl; where princes die, and new
sovereigns ascend the throne; new mnini-
ite-s and newc ecou~nfels su~cceed; the whole
face of affairs is changed ; and former plans
fall into oblivion. But the throne of the Lord

]His unchanging dom~inaion comnprehenads a~ll

to thing~s wvhich in themselves are fludknat-

appear most confus~ed. Well may the earth

still more complete, when they confider

nef. It contradided every p~repoffem~on
wAYhich their confinedk.ideas of religion ap'd
philofoph'y led them to ebtertain. If a fupe-
rioury Being was to inteipore for th;e reffe-

ration

;ration of a degenerate world, they concluded S EVR~ M.
that he would certainly appear in celeitial I
majeity. But the thoughts of God are not
as the thoughets oymen.n The divine wis~dom
fawn it to be fit that the Saviour of mankind
d~oulld in' all things be mnade like utnto thoj2
wEhomn he came to save. By living as a nman
among men, he dispensed initrudtion in the
ano~t winning; manner. H~e added to in-
fpiruQion the grace and the force of his own
example. He accomrmodated that example
to the moRt trying and difficult situations of
human life; and, by f~uffering a painful
death, he both taught men how to f~uffer
and die; and in that nature which had of-
fended, he offered a solemn exlpiation to
God for human guilt.

Besides thlefe ends, so worthy of God,

which were accomplished by the incarna-
tion of Chriit, another, of high importance,
is fuggefied in the text, Hjuman life is to
good men, as well as to others, a state of
ff~tering and diftrers. To IApply. thema
with proper co~nsolation and encouragement
during such a slate, was one great purpole

I 4 of

SER 19. of the undertaking of Chirift. With thia

( r~view he assumed the office of their high

priest, or mediator with God; and the en-
couragerment which this office affords t'h-em,
will be proportioned to their assured belief,
fits1 of his power, and next of his coma-
Ipelion. FItPs power is set forth in the v~erse
precedfiti the t~ext, and the proper argu-
rnent is founded upon it. Seeing thlart er
hKave a gpreat high~t priejZ wh~o is faf~d into
tth heavensJ, 'yefus the Son of God, let us hold
fafZ our f rocefiona. But though it be en-
coirraging to know that our high priest:
is the Son of God, and that he is Paje-d ~into
the heavens, yet there faats alone are not
fufficient to render him the full objea of
our confidence. F~or as the apoitle= after-
wards oblerves, it belongs to the charader
of a high priest to be taken from nzlamong en,
that he may have compafion on the ignorant
and them that ar-e ourt of the weay, Seeintg that
he himpl~f is comzpapd wreith inmity. In
order then to s~atisfy us of our high prieft's

THaE affiertion in the texet of Chrift's be-

plainly implies that he had full experience
botlh of the erster~nal diffreffres, and of the
internall forrowrs of hurman nature. Affumn-

hre would have been a fuflFerer in appear-
ance only, not in reality; there would have
been no merit, in his patience, or in the re-
fignation which he expressed. On the con-

that the sensibility of his nature ·was tender-

of innocent nature oppressed with angulfh.

life was in this refpea ta course of ternpta-

RExolv this view of the, fadis whi~ch -are

slated in the text, I proceed to shew how

- juffly we may infer our Saviour's compaf-

sion, and in what manner it is to be ace
cormmodated to the consolation` of good men
amidst: various exigencies of life.

It has been the universal opinion of man-

kind, that personal experience of fiuffering
humanizes th~e heart. In thle s~chool of as-~
fliaion, compaflion is always supposed to
be tr oft thoroughly learned; and hence, in
the laws of M~oles, vclhen the Ifragelites are
comman~ded not to oppress the firanger, this
reason is given, for yout knowe the heart of a
fr7angrer, Sfeingr ye wevre franger- s y'ourfives

ina the landr of Egypt*. The diff refed, acb es SR M.
cordingly, fly for consolation to thos`e who .
have been their-companions in woe. They
decline the profpgerous, and look up to
them with a fulipicious eye. They confi-
der them as ignorant of their feelings, and
therefore regardless of their complaints.
A~midst the manifold forrowNs of life, thaen,
how soothing is the thought that our great;
Interceiffor with G3od was a fellowm-fufferer
with ourselves, while he passed through
this valley of tears.

But was it necessary for Christ, it may

be said, to aifumne our nature in order to
acquire the knowledge of its infirmity and
distress~ ?As a divirne person, wsas he not
Iperfealy acquainted with our frame before
he descended to the earth ? DClid he fland

to ·the mifierable. They are apt to· rejet

mrent. The r~eprelentations given- us of the
D3eity in Scripture, affordl undoubtedly mu~~cha
ground for truss in his goodnzefs. But the
perfeaion of an Almighty 1Being, who
dwn~leret in the se~cret: place of eternoity,
wharom no man bath Jen -or c~an See, is over-
wh~elming to a tirlnid apprehedlion. The

unlknown foun of goodness. W~ahatevrer
proceeds from a'nature so far fuaperiour to
our own, is beheld with a' degree of awe,

wvhich

wirhich is ready to ove~rpower hope.: FJ~pon s.E R Mr.
this account, uander the Old Testament dif- V,·
penfation, the Supreme Being is-often die--
fe~ribed with the attributes of as man, i~n order
to give 's shade and softening -to:h~ais· grecat-
pyers, and to accommodate his go~odness
more to our capacity. The· relentings of a
friend, the pity of a parent, and the: sighs.
of a mourner, are afetibed to the Almighty.
B8ut we easily pei-ceivie fiich attributes to be
no more than figures and ,alluficus. The
comfort which they afford is not definite!
nor precise. They leave the mind under

giaife. Of this the text fuggeRs a remark-
able inflance. WNhen our Lord appeared
ins the land of Judea, the purity of his doe-
trine, and the evidence of his miracles,
procured him a considerable number of fol-
lowers, chiefly among the lower clal~es of
mnen. But the Pharifees, w~ho wScere the
leading and fafhioriable se~t·, galled with
the freedom of his rep~roofs, decried him as
an impoi~or. H-]ence it came to pals, that
though f me of the rue~lers belieuea'n h~im, yet
becau/e of the Pharge, e~thy did not conff~
h7im. Rulers, persons who, by their rankr and
education, ought to hav6e been fup~eriouar to
any popular prejudice, were so far overawed
by the opinions of others, as to flifle their
c~onvidion, to dissemble their faith, and to
jpm with the prevailhag party ia condemn-
ing one whom in their hearts they revered :
for which this reason is given, ·that theyP
lovued th;e frap of men more thant the prsa

L 3 pest

S E M~,EV~. nest condua, let us, with some attention,

b~y~3examine the nature of this pafflon. Let: us

confider how far it is an allowable principle
of adtiou s when it begins to be criminal;
and upon what accounts we ought to guard
against its acquniring the entire ascendant.

'ME are instende~d by Providence to be con-

neaed with one another in society. Single
unaffilled individuals could make fmnall ad-
vances towards any valuable improvement.
By mneans of society our wants are supplied,
and our lives rendered comfortable; our
capacities are enlarged, and our virtuous
affeaions called forth into proper exercise.
In order to confirm our mutual connedion,
it was necessary that some attrading power,
which had the effeat of drawing men toge-
ther, and firengthening the social ties, thould
pervade the human fyfitem. Nothing could
more happily fulfil this puarpof~e, than our-
being so formed as to desire the efleem, and
to delight in the good opinion, of each other.
Had s~uch a propensity been wanting, and
felfith principles left to occupjr its place, so-

clety

clety must have proved an unha~rmonious SER M.
and difocordan~t fate. Inflead of mutual at- ,I
traftion, a repulIv~e power would have pre-
vailed. Among ren who had no regard to
the approbation of one another, all inter- i
course would have been jarring and offen-
iv~e. 1For the wcsifef1 ends, therefore, the de-
fire of praise was made an original and
powerfid principle in the human breast.

Tro ae variety of good purpos~es it is sub-

servient, and on many occasions co-operates
with the principle of virtue. It awiakens
us from sloth, invigorates aaivity, and fli-
mmulates our efforts to excel. It has · given
rife to most of the s~plendid, and to many of
8the ufrefunl enterprises of amen. It has aeni-
mated the patriot, and fired the hero. M~ag-
nranimity, generosity, and fortitude are what
all manakinad admrire. Hgence funch as were
aa~uated by the desire off extensive -fame,
have been prompted to deeds whiceh either
participated of the ipirit, or, at least, car-
r-ied the appearance off distinguished virtu~e.
The desire of praise is generally conneatedl
wlith all thae fjiner fenfirbilities of: huanwa na-

L 4 ture.

SE R M* ture, It affords a ground on which exhort,

1L~bp3ation, counsel, and reproof can work a pro-

per effea.' Whereas to be entirely ~deffitute
of this passion, betokens an ignoble mindl,
on which no moral irmpreffion is 'eafily
maade. Wheld: there is no desire of praise,
there will be also no fed~e of -reproa~ch;
and if that be extinguilhed, one of the
principal guards of virtue is remnoved, and
the path opened to raany opprobrious
pursuits. H-e whos~e countenance nevrer
glowed with shame, and whol~e heart never:
beat at the found of praiife, is not deffined
for any honourable diffinaion; is likely
to grovel in the sordid quest of gain,, or to
slumber life away in the in~dolene of felfii4
pleasures.

Abftra~ting from the: featimnents which

are conneaed with the love of praise as a
prirnciple of aEdion, the efleemn of our fel-
low-crelatures is an objeat which, on ac-
count of the advantages it brings, rnay be
lawfully pursued. . It is neceifary to our
succes~s in every fair and Ihoneft undertak-
ing. Note only our private interest, but our

public

pub~lck ofgf~ulnefs,.depends la a~gre aPwafi~are s8 M.
upon it. The sphere of our influence -is
contra.Qed or enlarged in rproportion to the
degree in which we enJoy the good opinion
of the public.' M~en listen with an uawil-
ling ear to one swhom they do not honour;.
while a refpeated charader adds weight to
example, and authority to counsel. To
desire the efteem~r of others for the [agke of
its effedts, is not only allowable, but in many
caf~es is our duty; and to be totally indif-
ferenit to prais~e or cediure, is so far from
being a virtue, that it is a real defeQ in
ch~aradter.

But while the love of prais~e is admitted

to be a natural, and, in so many refpeats,
an useful principle of adion, we are to
o2bserve, that it is (entitled% to no m~ore thana
our secondary regard. It has its boun-
dary set; by tranfgrefirng which, it is at
once transfgormred fromn an innocent into a
mnoft dangerous pafflon. Mor~e s~acred and
vsenerable principles claim the chief direc-
gon of human conduRt. All tPhe good es-

I2 fa

s'E M. eBs whfichi we have aferiibedd to the desire
6,.. ',,,, of prajfe,' are produced by it when remain-

ing in a fiurbordinate la~tion. But when
passing its natural line, it becomes the
ruling [pxring of condua ; when the regard
vtvhich we pay to the opinions of men, in-
croaches onl that reverence which we owe
to the voice of conafcience and8 'te sense of
duty; the lovie of praise having then gone
out of its proper place, infltead of improv-
ing, corrupts; and inficad of elevating, de-
bases our nature. TFhe proportion which this
pafiron holds to other principles of aaion is
w7hat renders it eithmer innocent or crimninal.,
aThe crim~e with.which the Jewi~th rulers are
charged in the text, was not that they loved
the prais~e of men; but that they loved it
more th~an the frape of God.

E~iven in cafes ~where there is no dired

competition between our duty and our
fancied honour, between the praise of men
and the praise of God, the pafiron for ap-
plaus~e may become criminal by occupying
the place of abetter prin~ciple. When vaina-
g~lor~y uf~urps the throne of virtue; when

o~entation

Oitentaition, prqdices aaions which con- 8 ER I~l
fecience ougit to have dlidated ; such adlions, ~sp
however rpecious have no claim to moral
or -religious pr aife. We know that good
sdeeds, dolne m~erely to ~be fen of· mens, lose-
their reward with God. If, on occasion of
some trying conjunaure, which makes 'us
hesitate concerning our line of conduat, the
firflt queition whick -occurs to us, be not
whether an aaion is right in its~elf, and luch
as a good man ought to perform, but whe-
ther it is fuclh as will find acceptance with
the world, and be favourable to our fagme,
the conlclufion is too evident, that the desire
of.applaufe has obtained an undue afcendlant.
What a wif~e and- good man ought to fludy,
is to pres~erve his mind free from any fach
solicitude concerning praise, as may be ine
haazardi of overcoming his sens~e of duty.
Thae approbation of men he may with to
obhin, as far as is con~filent with the ap-
probationm of God. B~ut wrhen both cannaot
be enjoyed together, there ought to be no

that within the narrow boundaries of that
country to which'he belongs, and during
that imall por-tion of time which his life fi~lls
up, his reputation, great as he may fancy
it to be, occupies no more than an incon-
fiderable corner. Let himn think what mnul-
titudes of those among wvhoma he dwells are
totally ignorant of his name and charad~er;
how· many imagine themselves too import-
a-nt to regard him; how many are too much
occupied wvtith their owhn wants and purs~uits

IN the lecood place, an excessive love of
paife~ never falils to undermine the regard
due t'o confclence, and' to corrupt~the heart,
jt` frns off the eye of the mind fromn the.
eixds whilch it ought: chiefly to keep in view ;
Sand sets up a f'alle fight for its guide. ItS
itRifuene is the more dangerous, as the co-
Ibutn which it affunles is often fair s and its
garb and appearance are~ nearly allied to
that of virtue. The love of glory, I before
aid'itted, may give birth to amious which
are both iplendid and useful. At a difiance
they itrike the eye with uncommon bright-
ixefs; but on a nearer and! frider s~urvey,
their luffre is often tarnifhedl. They are
found to w~ant that f'acred and venerable dig-
zilty which chara~aferif~es rtrue ~irrtue. Little
Ipafflons and felfif interests entered into the
motives of tlhofe who performed them. They
were jealous of a competitor. They fought
to humble a rival. They~ looked round for
pe~a~tors to admire them. All is magua-

M~ 2 nimity,

& ER M. nimity, generosity, and .courage, to public

~ I:,.view. But the ignoble source whence these

seeming virtues takes their rife is hidden.
W~ithout, appears the hero; within, is found
the man of duff and clay. Codiule such as
have been' intimately conneded with the
followei-s of renown; and seldom or never
will you find that they held them in the
fame efteemn with those who viewed them
fro'n afar. . There is nothing, ,except £1m-
plicity of intention, and purity of principle,
that can fland the test of near approach and
firia examaination.

But supposing the virtue of vain-glorious

men not to be always fals~e, it certainly can-
not: be depended upon as firm or sure. Con-
flancy and fleadinefs are to be looked for
fkrom him only whole conduQ is regulated
by a sense of what is right; wehoep raTey is
not ofmen, but of God; whofre motive to difi-
charge his dutyr is always the fame. Change,
as mucht as you pleafre, the situation of Crchl
a man; let applause or let cens~ure be his
lot; let the public voice, which this day has
exrtolled him, to-mo/row as loudly decry

H3 him;

hhn; on the tetrour of his beha~viour there· sk8A-M.
chlanges produce no effea. H~e moves in ·-I.
a higher [phere. As the fun in his orbit is
not interrupted by the mists and florms of
the atmorphere below; so, regardleis of the
opinions of men, thr-oughb honourP and dyl
hJon/uer, thbroughr good ref or t and bad ref ort,
he pursues the path which confelence has
markedl out. WNhereas the apparent virtues
of that man whole- eye is fixedl on the world,
are precarious and temporary. Supported
only by circumfktances, occasions, and par-
ticular regards,. they fluanate and fall with
there. 'Excited by public admiration, they
difazipear when it is withdrawn; like those
ex~halations which, railed by heat from the
earth', glitter in the air with momentary
splendour, and then fall back to the ground
from whence they [prung.

The intemperate love of praise~ not only

weakens the true principles of probity, by
substituting inferiour motives in their flead,
but frequently also impels men to aations
which are direacly criminal. It obliges them
to follow the current of popular opinion

ill men, the least likely to avoid it. For
he draws upon himself a thousand eyes that

aEvery opportunity will be watched of bring-

er-rours will be more divulged, and his in-
firmities moire magnified than thos~e of

Nor is it reproach alone that will wound
him. He vi~ll be as much dejeated by

wvhen praise is be~towed, he is mortified by aE M w.
its being either faint or trite.. He pingsb-

of applaule to which he has been accuffomed
.grows insipid ; and to be alwayrs praifula

the fame with not being prailed at all.

All there chagrins and difq~uietudes are

happily avoided by him who keeps to trou-
blefome a pafr~an writhin its due bounds;
who is more desirous of being truly worthy
than of being thought so; who purfules the
praise of the world with manly temperance,
and in subordination to the praile of God.
H~e is neither made giddy by the intoxicat-
ing vapour of applause, nor humbledd and
can down by the unmerited attacks of cen-

enjoys hirmfelf in peace, wheth~er human

SEf" M. i frious maxim has been more ge-·

~BIP~LP~~nerally adopted than that of the text.

In every age, the vanity of human life has
been the theme of declamation,,and the sub-
jeQ of complaint. It is a conclusion in whichl
men of all charaders and ranks, the.high
and the low, the young and the old, the
re igious and the worldly, have more fre-
qluently concurred than in any other. But
how just soever the conclusion may be, the
premises which lead to it are often falie.

Sometimes it is the complaint of a peeviifh
ana~n, who is dilcoqntented with his Riation,
and rufflied by the dif~aplpointment of unrea-
fobnable hopes. Sonietimes it is the flyle of
the licentious, when groaning under miseries

I;nveaives againf1 the vanity of~ the world
~which come from any of there quarters. de-
serve no regard; as they are the didtat~es of
impiety, of spleen, or of folly. The only
cafe in which the fentimrrent of the texst
claims our attention, is, when uttered, not
as an aspersion on ]Providence, or a reflee-
tion on buman affairs in 'general; not as the
language of private discontent, or the result
of guilty f~ufferings; but as the sober <;on-
dlution of a wife and good man, concerning
·the imperfeation of that happineifs which
rests solely on worldly pleasures. There, in
their fair~ef fornm, are not what they freem to

Nothinirg is of higher importance to us, as

estimate of human life, without either: load-
ing it with imaginary evils, or expetdmng
from it greater advantages than it is abl~e to
yield. I~t shall be ~aj business,, therefore,
In this Discourse, to dliftinguifh a j~ift and

'admit; disappointment in purs~uit, diffatifi-
fa £ion in enjoyment, uncertainty in pofb
session.

Firfl:, disappointment in purs~uit. When

we look around us on the world, we every
wNhere behold a busy multitude, intent: on
the prosecution of various designs which
their wants or desires have s~uggested. We
behold them employing every method which
ingemxiity can devile, some the patience of
industry, some the boldness of enterprise,
.others the dexterity of firatagem, in order
to compai-s their ends. Of this incessant flir
and aEtivity, what is the fruit ? In compa-
ri~fon of the crowEd 9who have toiled in vain,
how fmaall is the number of the fuccetfsful ?
Or rather, wmhere is the man wnho will de-
clare, that in every point he has completed

Na 3 bis

SER M. his plan, and attain~ed his utmost with ? No

e4~PJextent *of human abilities has been able to

dircover a path which, in ·any line of' life,
leads unerringly to success. Th~e race is not
alweays to thSre/wy~, nor the battle :to the/lronag,
nor riches to mnen of unzderflanding. We may
fortn our plans with the~ utmoRt profound fag-
gacityr, and with the moRt vigilant caution
mnay guard against dangers on every fide.
But some unfores~een occurrence comes
acros~s, which baffles our wifdlom, anid lays
our ~labour~s in the dust.

Were furch disappointments .confined to

those who aspire at engrossing the higher
departmpents of life, the misfortune would be
less~. The humiliation of the mighty, and
t he fall of ambition fr-om its towering height,
little concern the bulk of mankind. There~
are objeas on which, as on diitant meteors,
they gaze from afar, without drawing per-
fonal initrumon fr-om events to much above
them. But, alas ! when we descend into
the regions of private life, wre find difap-
point-ment and blasted hope equally preva-

eat tere. eithei- the m~oderation of our

viewas,

views, nor the, juffice of our pretensions, can S ER M,
ensure fuccers. But timae dand cha~p;nc ha ^nvu.,
to all. . Against the fiream of events both
the worthy and the undeferving are obliged
to Atruggle; and both are frequently over-·
born alike by the current..

BE SID Es di~a~ppointrment in purs~uit, dif-

fatisfa~tion in enjoyment is a farther vranityp
to- which the human slate is f~ubjeft. This
is the s~everest of all mortifications, after
having been fuaccefsful in the perf~uit, to be
baffled in the enjoyment itielf. Ygt this is
.found to be an evil fitill~ more general than
the for~mer., Some may be s~o fortunate as
to attain what they have purs~ued; but none
are rend~ered completely happy by what they
have attained. Disappointed hope is mi-
fery; and yet Auccefsful hope is only im-
perfe61blifs. Look through all the ranks of
mankind. Examine the condition of those
who appear most prosperous; andl you
wvill find that they are never just what they
defire.to be. If retired, they languish for
aation; if bury·, they complain of fatigue.

N~ 4 Egf

8 Ed M. If in middle life, they are impatient for diC-

~pa, tination; if in high Rations, they figha after

freedom and ease. Something is Rill want.
ing to that plenitude of fatisfadtion which
they expedted to acquire. Together with
every wisha that is gratified, a new demand
arises. One void opens in the heart, - as
another is filled. O~n wishes, wishes grow;
andl to the end, it is rather the expedation
of what they have not, than the enjoyment
of what they have, which occupies and in-,
tereffs the m~lft. fuccefsf6u l.

TFhis diffatisfadion, in the rndcit of hu-

man pleiifure, springs partly from the nature
of our enjoyments thems~elves, and partly
from circunmitances which corrupt them.
Ne~o worldly enjoyrments are adeqluate to the
high desires and powers of an immortal
s~pirit. Fancy paints them at a difiance with
iplendid colours; but poffe~fion unveils the
fallacy. The eagernef~is of pafi~on beffows
upon1 them at ffirft a br-isk and lively relish.
EPut it is their fate always to pall by fami-
liarity, and sometimes to pass from satiety
into difguf. Happy woulld the poor man

treatures of the rich; and happy for a thort b
while he might be; but Jbefore he had long
contemplated and admired his slate, his pof-
fefliions waould seem to lessen, and his cares
wpould grow.

Add to the unsatisfying nature of our

gpleaf~ures, the attending circumitances which
never fail to corrupt them. For, such as
tPhey are, they are at no time p~offeffed un-
mixed. To human lips it is not given to
taftethe cup of pure joy. Wlhen external
circumfkances sho4w fairest to the world, the
envied man groans in private under his own
burden. Somae vexation difquiets, some pas-
sion corrodes him; some diitrels, either felt
or feared, gnaws, like a worm, the root of
his felicity. When there is nothing from
without to dliflurb the prosperous, a fccret
~polfon operates within. For worldly hap-
pinef~s ever tends to deitroy its~elf, by cor-
rupting the heart. It foffers the loos~e and the
violent pafl~ions. It engenders noxious habits;
and taints the mind with a fals~e delicalcyl
wh~Bich makes it feel a thousand unreal evils.

BUTJ ms

s AH R M. BU'r put the cafe in~ the fff~avourable

t~L~Q~ ligh~t. Lay aside fromn human pleasures

both dis~appointment in purs~uit, and deceit-
fulness in enjoyment; s~uppose them tp be
fully attainable, and completely fatisfaaory;
still tlhere remra;ins to be considered the v~a-
nity of uncertain poffeffion and thort dura-
tion. W~ere there in worldly things any
fixed point' of security which we could gain,
th'e mnind would then have fbmne basis on
which to reft. But our condition iS- such,
that: every thing wavers and totters around
us. BoofJ~ not thfl~f ofC to-morr·oiz; for

It is much if, during its course, thou hearest
not of somewhat to disquiet or alarm thee.
F~or life never proceeds long in an uniform
train. It is continually varied by unex-
peaed' events. The f~eeds of alteration
are every where sown; and the s~unshine
of prosperity commonly accelerates their
growth. If your enijoyments be num~erous,
you lie more open on different sides to be
wounded. If you have poffeffed them long,
you have greater cause~ to dread an ap-

proa~ching

Iproaching change. By flow degrees pro- sWA wso`
[perity rises; but rapid is the progress of VL
evil. It requires no preparation to bring
it forward. The edifice which it coifr much`
time and labour to eredt, one inauifpicious
event, one slidden blow, can level with th-e
duff. Even supposing the ac~cidents of life
to leave us untouched, human~ blis~s must
flill be transitory y for man changes of him-
self. No ccourf~e of enjoyment can delight
us long. What amuled our youth loses its
charm in maturer age. As years adviance,
our powers are blunted, and our pleasurable
feelings decline. The silent laple of time
is ever carrying somewhat from us, till at
leng~th the period comes when all must be
4iwept away. T~he profpeat of this termina-
tion of our labours and purs~uits is fuffiicient
to mark our slate with vanity. Our days
are a hand-breadth, and our age is as no-
thing·. WL~ithin that little space is all our
enterprise bounded. WTe crowKd it with
toils and cares, with contention and firife.

$pail~ions, and fierce theny91lves· throucgh
woith maany ja~porrows Let us proceed to
jiaqnuire,

.II. How this vanity of the world can be

reconciled with the perf~eeions of its divine
Author. This inquiry involves that great:
difficulty which has perplexed the thought-
fful, and s~erious in every age: If God be
good, whence the evil that fills the earth 1
In anfwver to this int~ereff-ing quefioin, let:
Us obfrer ve,

In the firfk place, that the prefeat con-

dition of man was not his original or primary
slate. We are informed by divine revelation,
that it is the cons~equence, of his voluntary
a~poftalyr from God and a slate of inno-
cence. ]By this, his nature was corrupted ;
his powers were enfeebled; and vanity and

9 vexation

vexation introduced into his life. All nai- SLAnRI.
ture became involveed in the condemanation
of man. The earth was cursed upon his
aecount, and th~e whole creation mnade to
groan annd travail ina satin~.

H~ow tayfierious soever the account of

this fall may appear to us, many circum-
flances concur to authenticate the fast, and
to shew that ]human nature an~d thae hum~an
slate have undergone an unhappy change.
Tkhe belief of this has obtained in almof1l all
-nations and religions. It can be traced
through all the fables of antiquity. An ob-
faire tradition appears to have pervaded
the whole earth, that mnan is not nowt w~hat
he was at firit; but that in cons~equence of
fosme tranfgrefion against his great Lord,
at slate of degradation and exile A-cceeded
to a condition thRat was more flourithing and
happy. As our nature carr-ies plain marks
of perverflon and disorder, so the world
which we inhabit bears the. fyrmptoms of
having been convulfied in all its frame.
Naturalifts point out to us every where the
traces of some violent change which it has

~u fFered.

SE M. rffered. Ifhnds torn from the contineri4
;jM~pi burning~ mountains, thattered precipices, un-

inha~bitable wastes, give it all the appearance
of a mighty ruin. The physical and moral
slate of man ine this world mutually ijympa-
ahize. and correspond. They indicate not
au regular and orderly itruc~ure either of
mHatter or of mind, but the f-emains of so~me-
what that once was more fair and mnagnifi-
cent. Let: us oblerve,

IN the rekcond place, that as this was not

the original, io it is not intended .to be the;
final state of man. Though in confe-
quence of the abuse of the human powers,
b in and vanity were introduced into this re-
gion of the univerfie, it wras not the purpole
of the Creator that they flhould be permitted
to reign for ever. H~e hath made ample
proviflon for the recovery of the penitent
and faithful part of his fubje61s, by the
merciful undertaking of that great refforer
of the world, our Lord Jefhls Christ. ]By
him h~fe and immzortalzity wzeere both pur-
chaled and brouzght to hight. The newe hea-

eOCUS

aens and the newe earthj are dis~covered, whbere- s an us
in dreleleth,_ ri;ghteoiffn-efs; where, through _'ffL
the divine grace, human nature shall regain
Its original honours, and man thall return to
be what once he was in Paradis~e. Through
thbfe high; discoveries of the Gospel, this
life appears to good men only ine the light
of an: intermedliate and preparatoryr slate.
Its vanity and misery, in a manner, difap-
pear. - They have every reason to s~ubmit
without complaint to its laws, and· to wait
in patience till the appointed time cotne
for the refitution of all thinga~s. Let us take
nostice,

IN the third place, that a future slate

being made known, we can account in a
satisfying manner for the present distres~s of
human life, without the smallest impeach-
ment of divine goodnes~s. T~he fuLferings
wre here undergo are converted into dilfci-
pline and improvemnent. Througha the
.blef~ng of Heaven, good is extrafted front
apparent evil; and the very mis~ery which
originated from finl, is rendered the means

SE ~M· of correaing sinful pations, and preparing

~ us for felicity. There is much reason to

believe that creatures as impedfed as we
are, require some sauch preliminary slate of
experience before they can recover the per-
fed~ion of their nature. It is in the ~midst~
of sdifa8ppointments and trials that we learn
.the infuffciency of temporal things to hap-
piners, and are taught to seek it from God
and Virtue. ]By thes~e the violence of our
pafflons is tamed, and our minds are form- ,
ed to obhriety and refle~ion. In the varie-
ties of life, occasioned by the vicifirtud~e of
worldly fortune, we are inured to habits
both of the aaive and the f~uffering virtues.
H3ow mu~ch soev~er w~e complain of the va-
nity of the world, faas plainly thew, that
if its vanity were less, it could not anfiwer
the purpose ·of s~alutary discipline. UJnfL-
tisfaatory as it is, its pleasu~res are still too
aHptt~o corrupt ourhearts. H~ow fatal then
muff the consequences h'ave been, had it
yielded us more complete enjoyment ? If,
with all its troubles, $ve are in danger of
beingr too much attached to it, how entirely

troubles had been mingled with its plea- "H-.
sores ?

Th~ere otfebleaations fertre in a great mea-

fapre to obviat~e the difficulties whbich arise
from the apparent vanity of the human
Rate, by fhewing how, upon the Christian
~fyfem, that vanity may be reconciled with
the infinite goodnries of t~he Sovereign of the
u~niverse. T~he pres~ent condition of man
is not that for which he was originally de-
signed; it is not to be his. final slate; and
during his paffiage through the world, the
diffreffes which he undergoes are rendered
medicinal and improving. After having
taken this view of things, the cloud which
in the preceding part of the dilcourfe ap-
peared to fit so thick upon human life, be-
gins to be dillipated. Wa7e now perceive that
m~an is not ~abandonaed by ]his Creator, $We
discern great and good defgigns going on in
his behalf. WVe are allowed to entertain
better hopes; and are encouraged to enquaire,

this class of evils. ~~It is among the higher

that, of those evils which may he called real,
because they owe not their exist~ence to
'fancy, nor can be removed by reaifying
-opinion, a great proportion is brought upon
us by our owri mifcondua. DHif~eaies, po-

able doom of men. They are much more
fSrequently the offspring of their own mnif-

raigning its fuppoled vanity. 'Chbe folija-

him amidst fares and precipices. The
one occallonally may, the other unavoid-

then confound, under one general charge,
those evils of the world which belong to the,
lot of humanity, and those w~hiclh, through
divine afifiance, a wife and good man mnayV,
in a great measure, escape.

TH~E third observation whrich I lalke re-

fpeas those evils whnich are both real and
amnavoidable; fro~m~ wmhich neither wlifdomE
nlor goodness can procure our exemption.:
Under thkere this comfbort renmains, that if
they cannot be prevented, there are means,
however, by .wihich they may be much al-
leviated. Religion is the great principle
wrihicha adis, u~nder fach circumffa~nces, as the
correttive of human vanity. It inspires
fortitude,: fuplports .patience, and by its

pr o fp e 4

pofppas and promires darts a cheering ray sqar .
jnto the darkeff' thade of human life. If it Vl1.
Fannot secure the virtuous from disappoint-
xnent in their puffiits, it forms them to. ficl$
a temper, as renders their disappointments
more light and eafyT than those of other men.
If it does got banieh diffatisfadion from~
their worldly pleasures, it confers [piritual
pleasures in their fead. If itenfures them
not the poff~effion of what they love, it far-
pilhes comsfort under the loss. As far as it
eftabliifhes a contenated frame of mind, it

p$plies the want of all that worldly men
covet to poffleft. Compare the behaviour
of the fenfinal and corrupted with that of the
upright andl.holyl when both are feeling the
effets of human vanity, and the difference
of their ftuation wll be manifest. Among
(he former, you are likely to find a querulouts
and dejeaed; among the la~tter, a composed
and8 manly sp~irit. T~he lamentations of the
one excite a mixture of pity and contemnpt;

consequences extend to far as to give ground
for asserting, that a good man enjoys more
Ihappine~is in the cours~e of a seemingly un-
prosperous life, than a bad man does in the
midst of affluence and luxury. What a
conspicuous proof of this' is afforded by the
Apofile Paul, who from the very depth of
afffiaionl could fend forth such a triumphant
voice as proclaims the complete viaory
which he had gained over the evils of life !

SucaI, upon the whole, is the efimirate s-E14 M

wh~ichm we are to Ifoprm of hunman life. M/luch CbID
vanity will always belong to it ; though the
degree of its vanity will· depend, in a great
measure, on our own charad~er and con-
duQ. To the vicious, it prelents nothing
but a continued gcene of disa~ppointment and
diffatisf~aalon. Tso the good, it is a mixed
slate of things; where mnany real comforts
may be enjoyed ; where many resources
und~er trouble may be obptained; but where:
trouble, in one ~form~ or other, is to be exr-
ped8ed as the lot of man. 3Froim this view~s
of humnanm life,

Ta 2 first praaical conclusion which we~

are to draw is, that it highly concerns us
not to be unreasonable in ou~r expe~aitions
of worldly f:elicity. Let us always remem-
ber wvhere we are; frorm w~hat caules the
humnan slate has become fubjeQ to depref~
sion; aird upon what accounts it must re-
mnain under its prefeat law. Such is the
infatuationl of felf-love, that though in the
general doarise of the van~ity of the world

.~; I0 all

~b~et~~~ himself that his own cafe is td bie an exce p~

tion from the common niile. H~e rests oil
cexpe~tations which he thinkes cannot faii
him; and though the prdrent bir not altoge-
ther~ according to his with, yet itekh the!
confidence of' cerrtan hope he anticipates
futurity. H~ence the ;anguish ofdifagppoinat-
mlentS fills the world; and evils, whichare
of themselves i'uf icienfpy severe, oppress with
double force the unprepared and unrfupe61:-
ing mind. 190thing therefbre is of greater
cons~equence to our peace, than to Ihave
always before our eyes sauch views of the
world as shall, prevent our expeding more
fr~om it than it is defdtirned to afford. WelV
destroy our joys by devouring them before-
hand with too eager expedtation, W~e ruin
the happiness of life when we attempt to
raifeg it too high. A tol~erable and comrfort-
able slate is all that we can propoi-e to our~
selves on earthm. Peace andB contenltment~
not blis-s nor transport, is the full portion of
man. Perfed pjoy is reserved for heaven.

BPut

Buti wvhile we repress too sanguine hopes S ER 19£.

formed upon human life, let us, in th~e fe- Vrn.
con-d place, guard againRt the other extreme,
of repinming and discontent. Enough has
been already said to thew, that notw~ith-
flanding the vanity of the world, a confi-
derable degree of comfort is attainable in the
p9relet R~ate. JLet the recolledtion of this
serve to reconcile us to our condition, and
to check the arrogance of complaints and
mulrmaurs.-W~8ha t art thou, O~ son of man !.
who having; hprung but yefferday out of the-
dust, dareft to lift up thy voice againit thy
Maaker, and to arraign his providence, be-
cause all thinlgs are not ordered according
to thy wish ? What: title halt thou' to find
fault with the order of the universe, whole
lotis to much beyond what thy virtue or
mseri gave thee ground to ~claim ? Is it no-
thing to thee to have been introdauced into
this mnagnificent world; to have been a~d-
maitted as a fpedtator ~of the divine wrifdomr
and% workss; and tro have had acces~s to all
thne comaforts wNhich Nr~ature, wNith a boaunti~fu
hand, hbas poured forth around thee I: Are,

a 4 all

S ER MaE. all the hours forgotten which thou haft panid~

b-J in ease, in -complacency, or joy ?I i

imall favour in thy eyes, that the hand ofd
divine mercy has been firetched forth to aid
thee, and if thou rejea not its proff~ered
alifiance, is ready to condua thee into a
happier state of existence ? Wrhen thou com-g
pareft thy condition with thy desert, blush,
and be ashamed ofshy complaints. Be filentr,
he grateful, and adore. Receive with thank-~
~fulness the blcfi~ngs which are allowed thee.
Revere that government which at preifeat
refuses thee more. Reft inthis conclufiorn
that though there be evils in the world, its
Creator is wife arid good, and has been
bountif~ul to thee.

IN the third place, the view which we

have taken of humnan life should naturally
direa us to fouch pursuits as may have most
influence for corredting its vanity. There
are two great lines of condua which offer
thems~elves to our choic~e. TFhe one leads
towards the goods of the mind ; the other
tow~arnds those~ of fortune. TFhe former,

whic~h

wh~qcic is adopted -only by the sets eingages s SER M.
hls ch~iefly in for~ming our principles, r~egu- ~.
lating our difpolitions, improving all our
inward powers. ' he latter, which in every
age has been followed by the nultitude,
points at no other end but attaining the
·conveniencies and pleas~ures of external life.
It is obvious that, in this last purfluit, the
franity· of the world! will encounter us at
evTery flep. For this is the region in which
it reigns, and where it chiefly displays its
·power. At the fame tine, to lay the world
totally out of view, i a vain attempt. The
numnberle~s~ ties by w~hich we are conneaed
with external things, put it out of our powrer
toa b~ehold thaema,witht indliiference. But
though we cannot wrap otnrfrelves up etl-
tirely in the care of the mind, yet the more
wre mnake its weTlfare our cihief objeat, the
nearer thall we approach to that happy inde-
Ipendence on the w~orld, which places us bei·
y·ondl the reach of f~uffering from ite vanity:

That discipline, therefore, which correas

the eagerner~s of worldly panions, which for-
tifies the heart with virtuous principles, which

cc~J and furnilhes to it matter of enjoyment from

within itself, is of more conf~iequence to real
felicity than all the ]proviflon which we can
make of the goods of fortune. To this let
us bend our chief attention. Let us Keep

rare th~e ffues o~f~ ik.~ Let us account our
mind the moss important province which is
committed to our care; and if we cannot rule
fortune, fludy at least to rule ourselves. Let
us propose for our objea, not worldly foc-
cess~, which it depends not on us to obtain;
but that uprig~ht and honourable dikcharge
of our duty in every conjunaure, which,
through the divine affifiance, is always
within our power. Let our happines~s be
fought where our proper praise is found ;
and that be accounted our only real evil,
which is the evil of our nature; not that,
which is either the appointment of Provi-
dence, or wthich arises from7 the evil of others.

BUT in order to carry on with success

this rational and manly plan of condua, it

is necei~ary, in the laRt place, that to moral, SER IE
we joinl Hreigious discipline. _Under .the~aipi
.prefeat imperfeaiorn of our mi~nds, -and
amidit the frequent thocks which we receive
from humran evils, mauch do wve fland in
need of every aflBifance for supporting our
constancy. Of all afr~ftance to which we·
can have recours~e, none is so powerful.as
what may be derived from the principles of
the ChriRian faith. He who builds on any
other foundation, will find in the day of
trial, that he had built his houle~ on the s~and.;
MPan is formed by his nature to look up to a
fuperiour~ being, and to lean upon a firength
that is greater than his own. All the con-
fiderations which we can offer dfor confirm-4
ing his mind, presuppose~ this refoure, and
derive from it their principal efficacy.

Never then let us los~e fight of thos~e great

objeas which religion brings under our viewi,
if we hope to fland firm and erea amidst the
dangers and diffreffes of our pres~ent slate.
Let us cultivate all that conneaion with the
great: Father of Spirits wrhich our conditionp
admits; by piety and prayer; by depend-

P~ 2 ence

S E R M. ence on his aid, and truss in his promises;

L~ff~by a devout sense of his presence, and a

continual endeaPvour to acquire his grace and
favour. Let us, with humable faitha and re~-
ve~rence, comamit ourselves to the b-leffred Re-
deemer of the world; encouraged by the
dificoveries w~hich he has made to us of the
divine mercy,· and by the hopes which he
has afforded us of being railed to at nobler
and happier flation in the kingdom of God.
So shall virtue, grounded upon piety, attain
its full firength. Insp~ired with a religious
Ifpirit, and guided by rational principles, we
shall be enabled to hold a fleady course
through this mixed region of pleas~ure and
pain, of hopes and fears; until the period
arrive ~whenr that clooud which the prel~ent
vanity of the world throws over human
rafairs, thall entirely diaplpear, and eternal
light be difufb~ed over all the works and

gratituade. WMhen he reviews the pas1 partL

green pafuzres, and led him- beside the fill

to dwoell in the ho#~- of~ the L~ord for ever.
AmidRt there images of tranquillity and hap-
pinels, one obje~t presents itself, which is
f~uficient to overcaif the minds and to damp
the joy of the greateR part of men ; that is,
the approach of d~eath. 1But on the Pf-almint

compofurre and serenity, he looks fbrward to
the time when he is to pars through the val~-
ley of the fadowe of death. The profpedt,
instead of dejedting him, appears to heighten
his triumph, by that s~ecurit~y which the pre-
fence of his almighty guardian afforded him.

herd who had hitherto conduaed him, would
support him with his flos while he passed
though that dark and perilous region, and

waith

with his rod, or pafltoral crook, would guard S ER M.
hun from every danger. ~

Such is the happy diitinalion which

good men enjoy, in a fituiation -th~e moit
formaidable to hum~an na~ture. T~hat threat-
ening frpeare which appals others, carries
no terrour to them. While worldly m'en
are juitly said throu6gh fear of Death to be
all their li9e-time fabjeft to bonadage, to the
righteous only it belongs to look on death,
and sm~ile. Since then it is in the power of
religion to confer upon us, so high a pri-
vilege, let us adventure to contemplate
fleadily this laRt foe whom wve muff all en-
coun~ter. Let us confdider wmhat death is in
itself, and by what means good men are
enabled to meet it with fortitude. Though
the f~ubjeQ may be reckoned gloomy, it
Imuff be admitted to be interefcing. T~he
close of life is a solemn and .important
event, to which every wife man will have
regard in, tlhe general tenour of his condu&t.
No one can ad his part with propriety,
wlho considers not how it is to terminate;
and to ex~clude from our thoughts what we

, P4 cannot

8 ERM. cannot. prevent from adually taking place,

c~, ,is the r~efuge of none butt the -tmorous and

weak. WV7e are mnore encouraged to enter
on this meditation, by refledting on the
fuperiour advantag~es which,~ as Chriftianfs,
we (enjoy for overcoming the fear of death,
beyond that holy man whole sentiment ·is
now before us. T~haTe great objeas, which
he beheld through the ~medi~um of tygpes
and figures, are clearly revealed to us. That
dispen-sation of grace, which in his days
began to open, is now -complet-ed. T~hat
life and immortality, which then only
dawned on the world, have now thone
forth with full light and splendour.

DEATH may be confideredl in three

views; as the separation of the foul from
the body; as the conclusion of the present
life; as the entrance into a newT slate of
existence. In the firfk viewv, it is regarded
as ~pai-nful and agonizing. In the kecond,
it is melancholy and dejedting. In the
third, itis awful and alarming. One of the
frirt enquiries which occurs concerning it is,

]so r

for what purposes ·it was clothed wvith all SER IVI.
there terrours? Why, under the govern-,V '.
snent: of a gracious Bein~, the. termination
of life ~was loabded with so~ muwch sorrow and
dliftrefs ? We know that, in consequence of
the fall, death was infidLed as a puoilhtnent
upon the human race. B~ut no unnecessa~ry
severities are ever exercised by God; and
the wisdom and goodness of the divine plea
.xrill be jmuch ~Ilufrated, by observing that
:alltahle formidable circuamftances ~whichn at-
tend death are, in the present situation of
ranakind, absolutely requisite to the proq
per government of the world. The ter-
rours of death are, in faQ, the great guard-
ians of life. They excite inl every indlivi-
dural that desire of felf-prefervation, which
is Nature's firRt law. T~hey reconcile him
to bear the dif~reffes of life with patience.
They promlpt him to undergo its useful
and necefa~ry labours wrLith alacrity; and
they re~train him from many of those evil
courses by which his f~afcey would be en-
dangered. While they are in so many re-
[peas beneficial to the individual, they are,

II at

SE *I~W at the farne time, the safeguard of faciety.

kr~sd If death were not dreaded and atbhorred as

it is by men, no public order could be pre-
served in the world. The %;word of 9autho-
rity were lifted up in vain. The finaions
of law ~would lose th~eir effed. Th~e fecaf-
fold and the exrecultioner w~ould be derided;
and the violent left to trample unrestrained
on the rights of the peaceful. If, notwith-
flanding the rfitraints which felf-preferva-
tion impoles, faciety is so often diflurbed
by the crimes of the wicked, what a s~cene
of confusion would it become, if capital
punishments, which are the last resource of
government, were of no influence to deter
o>ffender-s !

For s~uch important ends the conclusion

of life has, by the appointment of Provi-
dence, been made an awful objeQ. The
valley of death has been planted writh ter-
rours to the apprehenflon of mepn. Here,
as in many other inflances, what seemed
at frirt to arraign the goodness of the Deity,
is upon enlquiry found to confirm it. But
thouagh, for the most falatary purposes, it.

1,, was

wras requlfite that the fear of death thould SER M.
be a powerful principle in human nature, I.
yet, like our other propensities, it is a~pt,
whben left to itielf, to runa inmto excess. Over
many it uf~urps such an ascendant as to
debase their charader, and to dlefeat the
chief ends of living. To preserve it within
fiuch bounds that it shall not interrupt us ine
performing the proper offices and duties
of life, is the difination of the brave mxan
;a'bove the coward; and to furmounlt it int
such a degree that it ihall not, even in near
prof~ped, dejet our ipirit, or tr~ouble our
peace, is the great preference which virtue
enjoys above guilt. It has been the fludy
of the wife and refleaing, in every age, to
attain this fleadinef~s of mind. Philosophy
~purfuned it as its chief objea ; and profeffed
that the great end of its dis~cipline was, to
enable its votaries to conqjuer the fear of
death. Let us then, before we have re-
course to the more power-ful aid of: religion,
hearken for a little to what Reason has fug-
gefied on this fubjea. Her afifi~ance may,
perhaps, be not entirely derpicabile; and

though

aga 1l. though the armour which the offers, be not

.."' ~completely of proof, it may serve, how-

ever, to turn aside, or to blunt, forate of
the Ihafts which are aimed against us by the
ltaf foe.

AFTER this manner the may be su~ppos~ed

to addres~s mankind, in order to reconcile
them to their fate.---Children of men !
it is wnell known to you, that you are a
mnortal race. Death is the law of your
nature, the tribute of your being, the debt
wrhich all are bound to pay. On there
terms you received life, that you should be
ready to give it up, when Providence calls
youn to make room for others, who, in like
manner, when their time is come, flhall
follow you. H3e who is unwilling to s~ub-
mnit to death when H-eavien decrees it, de-
serves nogt t have lived.- YSoua might as
reafonlably complain, that you did not livae
before the time appointed ~for your coming
into the world, as lament thate you are not
to live longer, when the period of your
quitting it is arrived. WNhat divine Provi-

dence

d~ence hath made necefrary, human prt sit- SE M.
dence ought to comply with cheerfully. i
S~ubmit at any rate you must; and is it not
much' better to follow of your own accord,
than to be dragged reludantly, and by
force ? What privilege have you to plead,
or what reaso~n to urge, why you thould
possess an exemnption from the common
doom ? All things around you are mortal
and perishing. Cities, slates, and empires
have their period s~et. The proudest monu--
mnents of: human ar.t mnoulder· into duff.
EvPen the works of nature wax oldY and
decay. In the midst of this univerfatl ten-
dency to change, could you exped, that to
ygour frame alone a permanent duration
should be given ? All who have gone be-
fore you, have fubmnitted to the firoke of
death. All who are to come af'ter you,
shall undergo the fame fate. Thle great
and the good, the prince and the pealaint,
the renowned and the o'olcure, travel alike
the road wiihich leads to thie grave. At ·
the mioment whe~in you expire, thous~ands
throughout the worli-d thall, together with

yo u,

SER M. you, be yielding up their breath. Can

via that be held a great calamity which is com-

mon to you with every thing that lives on
earth; which is ane event as much accord-
ing to the cours~e of nature, as it is that
leaves thould fall in autumrn, or that f~ruit
thould drop frorn the tree when it is fully
ripe~:

The pain of death cannot: be very long,

and is probably less severe than what you
have at other times experienced. The pomp
of death is more terrifying than death its~elf.
It is to the weakness of imagination that it
owes ·its chief power of dejefting your fpi-
rits; for when the force of the mind is
rous~ed, there is alrmoft no pafflon in oumr na-
ture but what has fhewed itself able to over-
coime thae fear of death. HQonour has defied
death; love has derpife~d it; t~hame has ruflh-
ed upon it; revenge has disr~egarded it; grief
a th~ousand times; has withed for its approach.
Is it not firange that reason and virtue can-
not give you fireng~th to s~urm~ount that fear,
which, even in feeble minds, so many pas-
fions have conquered~ ?What inconfaftency

is there in complaining so much of the evils SER M.
of life, and being at the fame time to afraid 4fs
of what is to terminarte them all ? Who cana
tell whether his future life might not teenx
with difaf ters and miiferies, as yet unknown,
wvere it to be prolonged according to his
with ? At any rate, is it desirable to draw
life out to the laiR dregs, and to wait till old
age pour upon you its whole store of diseases
and sorrows ? You lament that you are to
die;· but did ~you view your situ-ation pro-
perly, you wt~ould have much greater caus~e
to lament if you were chained to this life
for two or ·three hundred years, writhout
pofirbility of release. ExpeQ therefore
calmaly that which is natural in itiielf, and
which muff be fit, because it is the ap-
.pointmnent of Hteabven. Perform your duty
as a good f~ubje~t of the Deity, during the
time allotted you; and rejoice that a
period is fixed for your dimilliion fro;m the
present warfare. Remember that the fla-
viflh dread of death destroys all the comfort
of that life which you seek to Ipreferve.

it is to be fulpedted that th'eir effeft will be~

at a difkance, than when beholding it at:

heart. It the ws us the forfeit of guilt paid
by a divine personage in our behalf ; and

some anxiety might remain concerning the
extension of that mercy to our own cafe in

awful.idea; almighty, unknown power, is
always formidable, and would be ready to
overwhelm the spirit of the feeble, were not
an intercessor with that sovereign revealed.

gratitude to Heaven for the hopes which

the human condition, as long as the terrour
of death hung, like a dark cloud, over the
inhabitants of the earth; when, after all the
toils' of life, the melancholy silence of the
grave appeared finally to clof~ie the scene of
existence; or, if a fu~ture Rtate opened be-
hind it, that slate teemed with all those
forms of horrour which conficious guilt
could s~uggest to a terrifiedl imaginlation !

~aV~Lin the circumstances of the human race, is

that produced by the dis~coveries with which
wve are blef~ed concerning the government
of the universe, the redemption of the -w~orld,
a~nd the future deitination of man. H lowv
much dignity is thereby added to the hu-
man charader and itate ! What light and

THiE ne~xt effeQ which thre fubjet we

hlave considered thould produce, is ana ear-
neiR desire to acquire those advantages which
good men enjoy at their death. The road
which leads to them is plain and obvious.
A peaceful· and happy death is, by the ap-
pointment of H~eaven, conneeted with1 a
holy and virtuous life. Let us renounce
criminal purfuaits and pleasures; let us fear

G od,

God, and keep his commandments; let us SER M.
hold faith and a good conscience, if we hope c
for comfort at our last hour. To prepare
for this last hour, every wife man thould
Eonfider as his 11oft knportant concern.
Dgeath may juitly be held the test of life.
Let a man have su~pported his charader:
writh eflteem and applause, as long as he
aded on the busy flage of the world, if at
the end he sinks inmto dejedtion andi terrour,
all his fbrmer honour is eftfaced; he departs
under the imputation of either a guilty con-
-science, or a pusillanimous mind. In the
other parts of human conduat, difg-ulfe and
s~ubtlety may impos~e on the world; but
seldom can artifice be s~upported in the hour
of death. T~he mask mos commonly falls
off and the genuine charaaer appears.

THE las1 infiruaion which our f~ubjet

points out, refpeas the manner in which a
wif~e and good rnan ought to fland affeded
towards life and death. He ought not to
be servilely attached to the one. He has
no reason abjeatly to dread the other. Life
is the gift of God, wh~ich he rnay justly
cherish and hold dear. Nday, he is bound
by all fair means to guard and preserve it,
that he may continue to be uifefhl in that
post of duty where Providence has placed
him. But there are highier principles to
which the love of life thould remain fu~eb-
ordinate. Wifherever religion, virtue, or true
honour, call him forth to danger, life ought
to be hazarded without fear. T~here is a
generous contempgt of death, wrhich should
distinguish those who live and walk by the
faith of immortality. This is the source
of cour~age in a C~hrist~ian. Hlis behaviour

the present world; ought to discover the 11- ~y
berty which he poffeffes, of following the
native eaktiments of his mind, without any
of those reitraints and fetters which the fear
of death impoies on vicious men.

At the fame time, this rational contempt

of death muR~ carefully be diitinguifhed from
that inconsiderate aqd thoughtles~s indiffer-
ence, with which some have affoeted to treat
it. This is what cannot be juitified on any
principle of reason. Human life is no trifle,
which men may play away at their pleasure.
Dleath, in every view, is an important event.
It is the moRt solemn creifis of the human ex-
iitence. A good man has reaon to meet it
w7ith a calm and firm maind. But n m ana
is entitled to treat it with Oltentatious levity.
It calls for manly ferioufnels of thoughat. ILt
requires all the recolleation of which we are
capable; that with the proper disposition of
dependent beings, when the duRt is about
to return to its du/1t, we may deliver up the

Ix. revolutions are foretold, which were to

take place in the church of God. They
are not indeed to foretold as to afford clear°
and precise information concerning the time

of their coming to pass. It would have SER As.
been, on many accounts, improper to have ~L
lifted up too far that awful veil which co-
vers futurity. The intenti~on of the Spirit
of God, was not to gratify the curiosity of
the learned, by difelofing to them the fate of
monarchies and nations, but: to sa~tisfy the
fCerious concerning the general plan, and final]
issue, of the divine government. Amidst
thof~de dii~reffes which befel Chri~tians during
the firit ages, the dil~coveries made in this
book were peculiarly seasonable; as they
thewed that there was an Almighty G~uard-
ian, who watched with particular attention
over the interests of the church wlhich he
had formed; who foresa~w all the comxmo-
tions which were to happen among the
kingdoms of the earth, and would to over-
rule them as to promote in the end the
caule of truth. This is the chief fcospe of

Such is the prof~pe61 with which the Divine
Spirit at intervals enlightens, and with which

On this day in particular, when we are to ~
commemorate the dying love of our Sa-
viour, we cannot be better employed than in
contemplating what his love hath purchas~ed;
in order both to awaken our gratitude, and
to confirm our' attachment to him. T~he
sacrament of the s~upper is the oath of our
fidelity. Let us~difpore ours~elves for cele-

and then shall make praftical improvement

our native inflin £s also, whaich impel u~s toa
Paffociate together.. The intercourse which
we here maintain witlh our fellows, is a
source of our chief enjoyments. But, alas !
how much are thes~e allayed by a variety of
disagreeable circumitances that enter into
all our connexions! Somnetimes we ~-fuffer

and fomaetimes ~friom their vices or fr~ailties.
WMhere friendlhip is cordial, it is exposed
to the wounds of painful sympathy, and to
the angulfh of violent freparation. Where
it is to cool as not to occaflion iympathetic
pains, it is never produftive of much plea-

fure.Thte ordinary commerce of the world
consists in a cir-culation of frivolous inter-
course, in which the heart has no concern.
It is generally insipid, and often soured by
the slightest difference in humour, or op-

position of intereit. We fly to company, in SE R IV.
order to be relievedt from wearisome corre- ZXx
[pondence with ourselves; and the vexations
which we meet with in focietyp drive us
back again into solitude. Even among the
virtuous, disse~nsions arise; and disagree-
ment in opinion too often produces aliena-
tion of heart. W Be form few connexionss
where somewhat ~does not occur to difap-
point our hopes. The beginnings are often
]pleasing. W~e flatter ourselves with having:
found those who will never give us any
disgust But weaknesses are too soon dif-
·covered. Suspicions arise; and love waxes
cold. 'We are jealous of one another, and
accustomed to live in disguise. A R~udied
civility afrumes the name without the pl~ea-
sure of friendship ; and s~ecret animosity and
envy are often concealed under the caresses
of dissembled affe6Hlon.

Hence the pleasure of~ earthly society,

like all our other pleas~ures, is extremely im-
perfeed; and can give us a very faint con-
ception of the joy that muRf arise from the
society of perfedt spirits in a happier world.

H er e,

SE R M. Here, it is with difficulty that we can fe-

~j~I~leR from the corrupted crowd a few with

w~ho~m w7e with to affciate in itriae union.
There, are assembled all the wife, the holy,
and the jult, who ever exited in the uni-
verse of God; without any diitrefs to
trouble their mutual bliis, or any source of
disagreement to interrupt th~eir perpetual
har~mony. Artifice and concealment are
unknown there. There, no comnpetitors
firuggle, nlo faalons contend : nlo rivals
futpplant each other. The voice of discord
never rises, the wrhifper of f~ulpicion never
circulates, among those innocent and be-
nevolent fpiritcs. Each, happy in himself,
]participates in the happiness of all the reit;
and by reciprocal communications of love
and friendsh~ip, at once receives from and
adds .to the fu~m of general felicity. Re-
new the memory of the moiR affeaionate
ffriendss with wvhomr you were bleRt in any
period of your life. DiiveRt thern of all
those= infirmities wh'ich adhere to the hu-
mnan charadter. Recal the moRt pleasing
and tender mnoments wihich you ever en-

joyed

joyedl in their society; and the reniem- SEr M.
brance of thos~e s~ensations may afitn you
in conceiving that felicity which is pof`-
s~es~Sed by the faints above. The happiness
of brethren dwzeelling together in uniat~y, is,
with great juffice and beauty, compared by
the Pfalmiit to su~ch things as are mos1 re-
frefhing to the heart of man; to the- fra-
grancy of the richest odours, and to the
reviving; influence of soft aetherial dews.
It ir like th~e preiours ointmzent pourred on~ the~
head of Aaronz ; Qand like th7e dewe of Hrerm7o7P,
even the dewe thas~t de/Scendcth on the moucn-
tains of Zi~on, whe~ere the Lord com~matndeth
the brlefingp, ev~en; lifefor everm~ore *.

Besides the felicity which sp~ring~s from

perfeet love, there are two circumnRan-ices
which particularly enhannce thle blefl~dnef~s
of that mutitude who fland beforeL thec throne;
these are, acces~s to the mofl exalted focietyr,
and renewall of the. mBiofa terider connexuions.

vey the most enlarged views of the kingdom
of-glory. Difmnay not yourselves with the
apprehenflon - of heaven being a confined
and almoR inaccefi~ble region, into which
it is barely pofirble for a fmaall handful to
gain admiflion, after making their ·efeape
from the general wreck of the human
race. In may Fath~er's houps~, said our Sa-
viour, thlere ar-e many ;maji~ons. That city
of the li~ving Goda towrards which you profes~s
to bend your cours~e, is prepared for the
reception of citizens innumerable. It al-
ready abounds with inhabitants; and more
and more shall be added to it, until the end
of time. Whatever diffculties there are in
the w~ay which leads to it, they have been
often furmaounted. The path, though nar-
row, is neither impassable, nor untrodden.
Though the gate flands not so wide as that
which opens into hell, yet throug~h the nar-
row g3ate multitudes have entered, and been
crowned.

lIt is much to be lamented, that, among all

denominations of Christians, thle unchari-

circumscribing the terms of divine grace ~tg
~withi~n a narrow cir~cle of their owna dlraw-

has often doomaed the other, without mercy,

that church to which each f~ed belongs, they
seem to hold it impossible for s~alvation to be
attained. But is this the genuine spirit of
the ~Goipel~ ?Can a Christian belie~ve the
efleats of the f~ufferings of Christ to be no

as if deiigned on puarpole to corre61 our

of~ the happiness and glory of the heavenly
f'ociety. They were beheld by the Ap~ole
jinding before the throne, and before th~e
, Lamb, clothted withk wehite robes, anda palms
in th~-r hands. All that there fabas and
white robes import, it is not given us now
so underitand. We know that among all
nations they have been us~ed as enfgbrns of joy
and viatory ; and are undoubtedly employ~ed
here to repres~ent that diflingulfhed felicity
and honour to which human nature sh~all be
then advanced. But· we mruit be endowed
with the faculties of the blef~ed, in order to
comprehend their employments and plea-

S 3 fisres;

8 ER M. rures; and therefore on this part of the

fX, ubjea I shall not attemlpt to enlarge. The
silence of humble and ref~pe~tful hope bet-.
ter becomes us, than the indulgence of those
excurflons of fancy, which degrade the sub-
jeR they endeavour to exalt.

One circumstance only cannot: fail to at-

traa particular attention;J that the blefird
are here deferibed as ftandking befare the
thronre, anad before ,the Lamb ; that is, en-
joying the immediate presence of the great
Creator, and of the merciful Redeemer o~f
the world. The unhappy difiance at which
we are now removed ~frorn God, is the
fo~eurce of all our woes. Those territories
w~hich we inhabit, are not H~is abode. They
are regions of exile. They are the dwell-
ings of a fallen race; and are condemned
to be invef~ed with clouds and darknel~s.
H-ere, G~od standeth afar off. In vain we
often pursue his pres~ence through his works,
his ways, anid his religious inflitutions. H~e
is laid to be a God that hideth himflf': He
d~welleth, as to us, in the Secret place of
thunder. H~e holdzeth back the face of his

throne,

thron~e, and /preadeth a thick clouds upon it. SER M.
The manifelltation of his presenc-e shall be
the signal for the renovation of all things.
Wh~en that Sint ofregihteoufn~e;J breaks fo~rth
1from the cloud ·- which now conceals hlim,
sorrow and fin, and every evil thing, shall
fly away before the brightnes~s of his face.
For neither guilt nor misery can remain
where God dwells. As the rifmng of the
foop transforms at once the face of nature,
.and converts the whole extent of space,
o-ver which his beams are s~pread, into a
region of light; so shall the divine pres~ence,
as~ oon as it is revealed, diffille universal
blife over all who behold it. It imports
fulneS of joy, anad flea/ure for evermore.

FRoM t310fe VieWS Of a liate Of future

h;appines~s which the text has fuggefied, va-
rious infiruations relating to life and prac-
tice naturally arise. We are taught to redtify
our nations of felicity; to look for it, not
in what is externaal, but in wvhat relates to
the mind and heart; in good dilpolitions
and a purified foul; in unity and friendship
with one another, and in the divine pre-
fence and favour. If such things form the
principal1 articles of future bliss, they cannot
but be effEintial to our happiness in the more
early periods of existence; and he who
fdeeks his chief enjoymnent friomn an opposite
quarter, erra widely from the path which
conduas to felicity.

We are farther taught whence to derive

constancy and perse~verance, amidf1 the pre-
sent dif~coura~gements of a virtuous life. Ina

this

V oa; 4[.. I . From

8 E SM. From the profpeats which the text has

(h~sdafforded, we may likewise learn what the

spirit is which should regulate our life.
Sandtity of condua, dignity of charadter,
elevation of affektions, become those who
exped to mingle with angels, and/piritJr of
jufP mena made perseEt. I mean not that such
profpedo thould carry away our whole at-
tention from the present world, where un-·
doubtedly lies the chief feene of human ac-
tion, of human duty. But while we aB
as inhabitants of the earth, we ought at the
Fame time to to remember our connexion
with a better world, as not to debaife our-
selves with whtat is mean, not to defile our-
selves w9ith w~hat is imapure, not to entangle
ourselves among w'hat is ensnaring, in the
preient slate. Let neither its advantages
elate, nor: its disappointments dejea us;
b~ut with an equal spirit, with a mind full
of immortality, let us pass through all the
*;hanges of this mortal life.

Finallyr, Let the diifcoveries of future ha -

pinefs mfpIire us with fumitable gratitude to
God and C~hris; to the eternal Father, who

originally

originally decreed s~uch rewards for the SE IVI.
righteous; and to the Son, who a~as in the ci
high charadter of the Dispenser of the divine
mercies, and the great Refforer of the fallen
race of men. Particularly when approach-
ing to God inl solemn aa~s of devotion, fach
as we are at this day to perform, let gratitude
bIe al~ive andl ardent in our heart. Trhe com-
muemoration of our Saviour's death is in a
high degree fauted to awaken every emotion
of tenderness and love. It brings before us,
under one view, all the obligations which
we lie under to this great benefaaor of man-
kind. When juff ready to f~ufer for our
fake, he inflituted this holy sacrament, and
said, Dbo th3is in remembrance of me. -Whom,
O~ blessed Jesus ! thall we ever remember, if
we are capable of forgetting Thee ? Thee,
to whom we owe the forgiveness of fin, and
the reffioration of divine favour; our viatoryr
over death, and our hope of life eternal!
Thou ]haft enlarged our views beyond these
territories of disorders and darknaels. T~hou
haft discovered to us the city of th~e living
God. Thou fettelf open the gates of that:

OIn CAND~OUR.P

I CORINaTH. xill* 5*

Chbarit~y-thlinkteth no Evil.

REkLIGIONE~ and Government are thae sER i,

two great foundations of order and .

comfort among mankind. Governmraentr~e-
firains the outrages and crimes which would
be su~bversive of society~, secures the pro-
perty and defends the lives of its ~ub-jeas.
But the defeat of government is, that hu-
mnan laws can extend no farther than to the
a~ions of men. Though they· prot~ed us
from external violence, they leave us open
on different sides to be wounded. By the
vices which prevail in faciety, our tran-

T 3 quillity

SE@R M. quillity rnay be diflurbedl, and our lives in

6~ various ways embittered, while government

can give us no redress. Religion supplies
the infiufficiency of lawv, by firiking at the
root of those~ disorders which occaflon so
much misery in the wrorldi Its profeffed
scope is to regulate, not a~ions alone, but
the temper and inclinations. By this means
it, ascends to the sources of condaht and
very ineffeatual would the wifell i`yfiem of
legislation prove for the happines~s of mlan-
kind, if it did not: derive aid from religion,
in softening the dif~pofitionls of men, and
checking many of those evil pafflons to which
the influence of law cannot possibly reach.

Wi7e are led to this refieaion by the de-

fe~ription given in the context of charity,
that great principle in the Christian system.
The Apostle places it in a variety of lights,
and under each of them ex~plains its opera-
tiaon by its internal effeas; not by the adions
to which it gives rife, but by the difpoitions
which it produces in the heart. Hde juffly
fuppoles, that if the temper be duly regu-
lated, propriety of amton will follow, and

II good

good order take place in external behaviour. 8 ER IV
O~f those charadters of charity I have chosen e"iB
one for the fubje~t of this difourfe, withich
lteads to th-e consideration of a virtue highly
importanit to us, both as Christians and as
maembers of society. I thall endeavoudt, firits
to explain the temper here pointed out, by
thewing what this defecription of charity~im-
ports, that it thinketh no evil; and then to
recommend fach a difrpolition, and to dif-
play the bad effeas of an opposite turn of
mbind.

, ]LEr us confiTder what this leferipption

of charity imports. You will easily perceive
that the expression in the text is not to be
undterflood8 in a sense altogether unlimited;3
as if there wAere t~o oceafon on w~hich we
are to think unfavour~ably of others. To
viewr all the a~eions of mnen wvith the famre
degree of complacency, would be contrary
both to common underi~anding, and to
many express~ precepts of iteligion. In a
wriorld where so much depravity abounds,
were we to think and fpeakr equally well of

T~ 4 all,

S E M. all, we muRt either be insensib~le of the dif-

~Z~ tinaion between right and wrong, or be

indifferent to that dillinfion when we per-
ceived it. Religion renders it our duty to
abhEor thtat wh~lich7 is evil; and, on many
occasions, to~experes our indignation openly
againit it. But the Apoitle, with great pro-
priety, defecribes the te'mper which he is re-
commending in such itrong and general
terms, as might guard us againRt that exn-
treme to whpich we are naturally moRa prone,
of rash and unjuit fuipicion. The virtue
wvhich he maeans to inculcate is that wh~aich
is known by thle name of candour; a vir-
tue, wh-ich, as soon as it is mentionedl,
every one will acknowledge to be essential!
to the charader· of a worthy man; a virtue
which we s~eldom fail of afecribing to ·any
perfobn w~hom we se~ek to r-ecommrend to the
esteem of others; but-wohich, I am afraid,
wehen we exam~ine our own condua in a
religious view, is feldoma the fuabje~t of
inquiry.

It is necef~-ary to oblaerve, that true CCarn-

dour is altogether differenlt from that guard-

ed,

ed, inoffenfive language, and that fludied SER M.;
opennes~s of behaviour, which we to fre- , x.
quently meet, with among men of the world.
Smiling, very often, is the af~pedt, and
iimooth are the words, of those who in-
wardly are the most ready to think evil of
rothers. That C=andour wh~ich is a Christian%
virtue, consists not in fairness of ifpeech,
but in fairnels of heart. It: may want the
~blandithment of external courtesy, but sup-
plies its place with humane and generous
liberality of featiment.~ Its manners are
unaffeaed, and its profeffions cordial.
Exemrpt, on one handl, from the dlark jea-
louly of a f~ulpicious mind; it is no less~
removed, on the other, from that eas~y cre-
dulity which is impose~d on by every fpe-
clous ]pretence. It is perfeatly confiftent'
with extensive knowledge of the world,
and with due attention tci our own s~afety.
In that varioulls intercourse wNhirchl~ we areY
obliged to carry on with persons of every
different charader, sus~picion, to a certain
degree, is a necefrary guard. It is only
when it exceeds the bounds o-f prudent cau-

tion,

8 ER W. teion, that it degenerates into vicec TFhere

x.g is a proper mean between undiftinguifhing

credulity and universal jealoufyr, which a
found underflanding dis~cerns, and which the
mnan of candour fludies to ]preserve.

He makes allowance for the mrixeture of'

evil with good, which is to be found in every
human charadter. gHe expeats none to be
faultless; and he is unwilling to believe that
there is any without fomne commendable
quality. In the midst of many defeas, he
can difcovrer a virtue. UTnder the influenace
of perso~nal res~entment, he can be just to the
merit of an enemy. H~e never lends an opea
car -to those defamatory reports and darkt
suggestions, which, among the tribes of
thme censorious, circul~ate witha so mnuch ra-
pidity, and meet with such ready acceptance.
HPe is not hasty to judge, and he requires
9full evidence before he waill condemn. Ats
long as an aaion can be aleribed to different
mnotives, he holds it as no mnark of sagacity
to impute it always to the worit-. WMhere
there is juff ground for doubt, he keeps his
judgment undecided; and, -during the pe-

£10 0

rpiod of f~urpenfie, leans to the moit chari- SER IVI
table conitruaion which an aaion can bear. x.
WF~Chen he mnui condemn, he condemns witha
regret; and without those aggravations
which the fevrerity of others adds to the
crime. He liitens calmly to the apology
of the offender, and readily admits every
extenuating circumf~ance which equity can
fu~ggeit. How -much soever he may blame
the principles of any fed or party, he never
confounds, under one general cediure, all
who belong to that party or fedt. He
charges them not with s~uch confeqjuences
of their tenets, as they refuse and dis~avow.
From one wrong opinion, he does not infer
the fubverflon of all found principles; nor,
from one bad adtion, conclude that all re-
gasrd to conscience is overthrown. WIhen
he beholds the maote in his brother's eyec, he
rema~embers the beam in his own. H~e coma-
mliferates human frailty ; and judges of
others according to the principles by which
he wrould think it reasonable that they
fthould judge of him. In a word, he views
m9en and adtionls ina the cle~ar fuLnfhine of

clharity

SER M. charity and good-nature; and not in that

~i~ dark and sullen shade which jealousy and

party-fpirit throw over all chara~ters.---
Such being in general the spirit of that
charity wvhich thintketh no evil, I proceed,

II. To recommend by various arguments,

this important branch of Christian virtue.

Let us begin with obse~rving what a ne-

ceffary requilite it is to the proper discharge
of all the social duties. I need not, fpendE
time in fhewing that therfe hold a very
high rank in the Christian system. The
encomium which, the Apofitle in this chap-
eter beffows upon charity is alone fufficient
to prove it. He places this grace at the
hlead of all the gifts and endowments which
can be po~ffeffed by man; and assures us,
that thougrh wee had all faith, So that we
culdc r-emove mnount~ains, yet if we be d effi-
tute of charity, it. weill proftt a~s nothing~.
Accordingly, love, gentleness, meeknefo, alnd
long--ffering are enumerated as diflin-
guifhing fruits of the /Pirit of Christ*. But

* calaQ. vr. 22, as.

it is impossible for s~uch virtues as these to EVR IVT.
findl place in a breast; where the propensity
to think evil of others is predominant.
Charitablle and candid thoughts of men are
the nece~ssary introduaion to all good-will
and kindness. They form, if we may
speak so, the only climate in which love
can grow up and flournith. A forpiicious
temper checks -in the bud every kind affee-
tion. · lIt hardens the heart, and eff~ranges
man from man. What friendship or gra-
titude can you exped from him, who views
all your condua with diffrdiful eyes, and
aferibes every benefit you confer to artifice
and firatagem ?~ T~he utmost which you
can hope from one of this charaaer, is
juffice in his dealings; nor even that can
you be afirued of; as the f~ulpicions to which
he is a prey will afford him frequaent pre-
texts for departing from truth, and for de-
sending himfaelf with the fame arms which
he conceives to be emnployed against him.
Unhappy will they be who are joined wit-h
him by any close connexion; expos~ed to
every malignant furpicion wvhich arises in

sER 0* his own mind, and to everyr unjuit fug-.

bp~ugdgefltion which the malice of ot'hers may in-~

sinuate against thern. That store of poifonz
which is colleaed within him, frequently
throws out its venom on all wlho are within
its reach. As a companion, he will be fe-
vere and f'atirical; as a friend, captious and
dangerous; in his domeffic sphere, harsh,
Sealous, and iras~cible; in his civil capacity,
seditious and turbulent, prone to impute
the conduat of his superiors to improper
mnotives, and upon loose information to con-'
denrnn their condua.,

The contrary of all this may be exp~ededl

from a candid temper. W~hatever is ami-
able in manners, or useful in society, na-
turally and easily ingrafts itel~f upon it.
Gentlenes~s, humanity, and compafflon, flow
from it as their native spring. Open and
cheerf~ul in its~elf, it diffufes cheerfullnefs and
good-humour over all who are under its
influence. It is th e chief ground of inu-
tual confidence and union among men.
It prevents thos~e animofities from arising
wehich are the OFfspring of groundless pre-

judice ;

jisdice ; or, by its benign interposition, al. S E RM..
lays thernwhen arisen. In the magiitrate,
it tempers juitice with lenity. Among
iabjeas, it p~romotes good order and furb-
rniffion. It conneas humanity with piety.
For he who is not given to think evil of his
fellow-creatures, will not be ready to'
cens~ure the dilpenfations of his Creator.
Whereas the fame turn of mind which
renders one jiealous and unjust towards
amen, will incline him to be querulous and
impious towards God.

IN the second place, As a futfpicious, un-

charitable fpiri 'is inconsistent with al-l
facial virtue and happinels, so, in itself,
it is unreasonable and unjuit. In order to
forra found opinions concerning chara~ters
and aaions, two things are especially re-
quilite, information and impartiality. But
such as are most forward to decide unfra-
vourably, are commonly deflitute of both.
Inficad of poffeffing, or even requiring, full
information, the grounds on which they
proceed are frequently the most flight and

frivolou.ta

as a at. frivolous. A tade, perhaps, which the idle

LP~psO.have invented, the in~quisi·tive have listened

to, and the credulous have propagated, or
a real mncident which rumour, in carrying
it along, has exaggerated and disguised,
supplies -them with materials of confident
ass~ertion, andl decisive judgment. From an
aaion, ·ithey ~presently look into the. heart,
and infer the motive. . This supposed mo-
tive they· co~nclude to be the ruling prin-
ciple; and pronounce at once concerning
the whole chara~er.

Nothing can be more contrary both to

equity and to found reas~on, than such pre-
cipitate judgments. Any than who attends
to wrhat passe~s w~ithin himself, may easily
dikern what a complicated fyfktem the hu-
man charader is, and what a variety of
cirfcunmiances muf~ ·be taken into the ac-
count, in ordeprto estimate it truuly.· No

wh~iich we b~elong, or to fomrae polithal de-
nomhxation under whicha we class ourkl~ves,
both confines our affedions iithin tooP
narrow a [phere, and gives rife to violent
prejudice~s against such as coarne under- an
ogppofite defeription. N~ot conP-tent-ed with1
b~eing in the right ourkdelves, we naiuff fi~nd
all others in the wrong. WSe clbam an ex-
clufive poffe~iron of goodness and wisdom;
and from approving wahi-my of those· who
jomn us, we proceed to condemn, with much
acrimony, not only the principles, but the
charaders off those from whom we diff~er.
-Hence -persons of well-difpofed minds are
too often, through the firength of partial
good affetion, involved in the crime of
uncharitable judgment. They rashly extend
Pto every inldividual the severe opinion
which they have unwarrantably conceived
of a wlaole body.--This man is of a partyg
whole principles we reckonm flaviflh; and

there-

therefbr a his whole fentimnents are corrupted. S ER M.
TEhat man belongs -to a religious s~eC -wahich x.
we are .accustomed to deem bigottpd; and
therefore he is incapable of any generous
or libecr8d thought. Another is conn~eaed
with a fe&B which.wre have been taught to
account relaxed; and therefore he can have
no f~anaity.--Are there: the judgments of
candour aind charity ? Is true Ipiety or
virtue t~o very limited in its nature, as to be
confined to such alone as fee every thing
waith our eyes, and follow exaaly the train
.o our .ide~as2 17 Wa there ever any great:
community so corrupt as n~ot to include
within it individuals of real worth?

Befidesprepoffeffl~ons ofthis nature, which
gormetimes mislead the honeR~ mind, there
are other, and much more culpable, causes
of uncharitable judgments. Pride is hurt
and wounded by every excellence in which
it can claim no share; and, from eagerneis
to dis~cover a blemith~, re~ts upon the slighteR;
~appearance of one, as a satisfying proof.
When rivalry and competition conctir witha
Ipride, our desire to espy dtefeets increases,

mutily here no opjpofition of interests

in warping the judgne~nt of many. Eveta
when none of these caules. operate, the in-
ward confbcioufnels of depravity is fuifficient
to fill the mind with evil thoughts of others4
W~hence thosld a man to readily draw his
opjinioln of~ men as from that chara~ter with
which he is best acquainted, becaus~e it is
his own~ ? A perons of lbow anad base msind
naturally imputes to others the featirments
wlpbich hee finds congenial to himself; and is
incredulous of every excellency which to
hire is totally unknown. He enjoys, be?
sides, consolation in the thought that others
are no better· than himlfelf; rthat his weaks-s
nmeffes and crimes are thoft of all men; anld,
that Euich as appear most diflinguaifhed for

greater dexterity in concealing their vices.
,Soothing- themse~lves with this dtoarine in

bad opinion which thiey entertain of all

to think pellt of that man's heart whbo is s Ex~f
on every occasion given to think the work ~·L

IN the fourth place, That faitable to the

sources whence a jealous and f~uipicious tema-
per proceeds, are the effecas which it pro-
dulces in the world, the crimes and milchiefs
with which it fills society. It po~ieffes this
unhappy diftindion beyond the o~ther -fail-
ingts of the human1 heart, that while it im-
pels men to violent deeds, it jufiafies to their
own apprehenflon the excesses which they
commit. Amidfk the uproar of other bad
passions, cons~cience aats as a reitrainiing
power. As soon as the tumult ~ulbfindes, re-
Inorfe~ exerts its infliuence, and renaders the
fianner feafitble of the e~vil wh~ichhe has done.
$But the uncharritable man is unfortunately
set: loose from any such check or controul.
Through the infatuation of prejudice, his
judgment is perverted; conscience is milled;
the, light weith~in him is turn~ed into daraknefs.
Viewing the obje~ts of his displeasure as evil
men, he thinks hims~elf entitled to give that

The· firfP fruits of an evil-thiliking rpirit

are calumtrany and detraPtion, by which so-
clety is to often embroiled, and men are set
at variance tvitiz one ano~ther. But, did it pro-
ceed no farteher than censorious [peech, the
uitchief would~be less. MVuch greater anid
mrore serious evils ~freqluently enfize. What
direful e~e~ts, for inflance, have often
flowed from rash and ill-founded j ealoufy in
private life ? No sooner has one allowed
-that dsemon to take pofIeflion of his mind,
than it perverts his innderflanding, and taints
all: his faculties. H~auntingC him by night
and by daly, bringing perpetually before
hima the odious and difquiieting formns which
it hRas raised up, it blackens every appear-
ance to his view; gives to trifles, whicha
are in themselves light as air, the weight of
`full confirmation; till what viras at dirit a

But it- is in religious difienfions chiefly, that
the mirchievlous power of uncharitable pre-
judice has displayed its full atrocity. Re-
ligion is always found to heighten every
gpaffionr on which it afts, and to r-ender
every contest into which it enters, uncom-
mnonly ardent; becaule the objeas which it
presents are of such a nature, as firongly to
seize and engage the hum~an minid. Wahenz
zeal for their own principles has prompted
men to viiew those cos a different persuasion
in the odious lights which 'bigotry suggests,
every s~entiment of hmumanity has too- often

been

SEyR M. beere extingulflhed. T6he mild influence of
.,,...1,, that religion which breathes nothing but

gentleness, has proved too feeble to restrain
the violent and bloody hand of persecution;
and the uncharitable ipirit, raging among
contending parties, has filled the world with
sauch calamities and crimes, as have brought
disgrace on the Christian name.

Let us attend particularly to lone awful

inflance of the guilt wvhich men may con-
traB, and of the ruin which they may bring
upon themnfelves, through the want of fair-
ners and candour. The nation of the Jews

and our bleffled Lord, appeared among them,
because the for~mer 8was auitere: in his tema-

olf him that he had an evil lfpirit; and, 'be-
caulie the latter w~as olpen a~nd frociable in ]his

i The wnorf1 consequences, both to ours~elves
Sand to society, follow from the opposite
spirit. Let us beware of encouraging a ha-
bit of rfupicions, by forming too severe and
harsh opinioris concerning human nature in
general. A great proportion of infirmity
and corruption, douabtlers-, adheres to it; yet
Itempered also it is with vIarious mixtures of
virtue and good affe~tion. Diarkened as the

Th8~e crimes of thne wicked mnake a noifre in
the world, and alarm focietyT. True worth
is retired and maodeft, and reqluires parti-

notice. The prophet Elijah, in a time of
prevailhng corruption, imagined that all true

X 3 exhibited

S ER M.` exhibited in the records of Scripture, is more

xt. remarkable or infiructive than that of this

patriarch. Hie is one whotm we behold
tried in all the vicilltudes of fortune; from
the condition of a slave, rifmng to be ruler of
the land of Egypt; and in every flation
acqluiring, by his virtue and wis~dom, favour
with God% and m~an. WVhen over~eer of
Potiphiar's houfle, his fidelity was proved by
firong temptations, which he honourably
refified. When thrown into prifbn by the
artifice of a false woman, his integrity and
prudence soon rendered him conspicuous,
evens in that: dark mlanfion. W7Vhen calle~d
into the presence of Pharaoh, the wife and
extensive plan w~hich he formed for s~aving
the kingdom from the miseries of impend-
ing famine, justly i-aif~ed him to a high fla-
tron, wherein his abilhties were eminently
dif~l~ayed in the public service. But in his

critical one of his life, and the most decisive p
of his charadter. It is such as rarely occurs
in the course of humnan events:; and is cal-
culated to draw the highest attention of all
who are endowed with any degree of feri-
Ability of heart. Let us confider· the s~enti-
ment which Joseph utters in the texrt under
two views, each of which is very iniqrualve
to all Chri~tians. I. As a diifovpery of his
cordial forgivenes~s of his brethren; and,~
II. rAs an inflance of his dutiful1 attention
to the Providence of God,

I. THE moftcordial forgivenes~s is here

displayed. I shall not recapitulate all the
preceding history refpeaing Jbleph and his
brethren; as it' is well known by every one
whlo has the least acquaintance wsith the
sacred writings. F~rom the whole tenour of
the narration it appears, that though Jo-
feph, upon the ar-rival o~f his brethren in
Egypt, madle himself fltrange to them, yet
from the beginning he intended to discover
haimf~elf ; anad studied so to conldua th~e dif-

X 4, coveryP

S;ER M. covery as might render the surprise of joy

c~X~j~complete. For this end, by aff~etedl feve

rity, he took measures for bringing down
into E~gypt all his father's children. They
were nlow arrived there; and Benjamin
among the reft, who was his younger bro-
thner by the fame mother, and was particu-
larly beloved by Jofeph.l Hire he threat-
ened to detain; and seemed arilling to al-
low the reft to depart. This incident re..
newed their diffrers. They all knew their
father's extreme anxiety about the s~afety of
Benjamin, and with what difficulty he had
yielded to his undertaking this journey.
Should he be prevented from returning,,
they dreaded that grief would overpower

, the old man's spirits, and prove fatal to his

life. Judah, therefore, who had particu-
larlly urged the necefi~ty of Benjamin's ac-
companying his brothers, and had solemnly
pledged himself to their father for his safe
return, craved, upon this occaflon, an au-
dience of the governor; and gave him a
full account of the circumstances of Jacob's
family.

N~othing

Nothing can be more intereRing and pa- S ER &(,

thetic than this discourse of Judah, as it is
recorded in the preceding chapter. Little
kno9wing to whom he [poke, he paints, in
all the~ colours of simple and natural elo-
quence, the diRreffed situation of the aged
patriarch, haitening to the close of life;
long afflilted for the loss of a favourite lon,
whom he supposed to have been torn in
pieces. by a beast of prey ; labouring now
under anxious concern about his youngeR
son, the child of his old age, who alone
was left alivre 6f his mother, and wrhomn
nothing'but the calamities of severe famine
could have moved a tender father to fend
from home, and expose to the dangers of a
foreign land. If wce brinag him not back
weith us, CWe hall bring dowen the grey hairs~
of thy fruant, ocr father, ·rcith s~orrow, to the
grav;e. I pray thee, therefore, l~t thy f~rvant
abide infead of the younlg mana, a bond~man to
our lordr. For ho~w shall I go uP to my fa-
ther, and Benjamins not ·with me? 7~ clefI e
the evil that~hall come on ay father.

Upgon

sE M. Ufpon this relation, Joseph could no

~~ longer reitrain himself. The tender ideas

of his father and hzis father's house, of his
ancient homne, ]his country and his kindcred,
of the diffref~s of his family, and his ~own
exvaltation, all rutheda too firongly upon his
mind to bear anyr further concealment. H
cried, CarC- every man to go out ~from me;
anal be wLept aloud. The tears which he
shed, were not the tears of grief. They
were the burst of affeation. They were the
eefflrons of a heart overflowing with all the
tender sensibilities of natur-e. Formerly he
had been moved in the ~amie manner, w~chen
he first: sa~w his brethrlen before3 himl.Hi
bowels yearned upon th~em; he fught for a
plac~e where to ~weep. He weent into his
chamber; anndtE~n wraged his face and r·e-
tucrned to thJem. At that period, his gene-
rous plans were not completed. But now,
~when there was no farther occallon for con-
firaining hmimfelf, he gave free vent to the
fR~ong emotions of his h~eart. The frirt
miniffer to the king of Egypt was not

athcamed8

ashamed to thew, that heK felt as a man, and SE R M.

a~N

brter e *ept· aloud, and the Egyp~-

tians and th~e houf~ of Pharaob beard him.

The first words which his iiwelling heart

allowed him to pronounce, are the most
suitable to such an affeaing situation which
were ever uttered;-I am 'foffh; doth my
fazther yet live -What could he, what
ought he, in that impafi~oned moment, to
h~ave sTaid more ? T~his is the voice of natuare
herifelf, speaking her own language; and
it penetrates the heart : N~o pomp of exu-
preflion; no parade of kindreies; but
firong affeftion htaftening to utter what it
ftongly felt. His brethren couldL nzot an/weer
him; for thtey wpere troubled at his pre-
Sence. Their silence is as expreflive of thoer
cmotions of repentance and fhamre, which,
on this ·amazing dilcovery, filled their
breaflts, and flopped their utterance, as the
few words which Joseph sp~eaks are expref-
five of the generous agitations which firug-
gle for vent within him. N~o painter could
seize a more firikingr moment for disp~laying
the char-atle~riffic~al features of the hurman

hear t,

SER MB. heart, than what~ is here prd~ented. Never

xt. w~as there a (ituation of more tender and

virtuouas joy, on the one hand; nor, on
the other, of more over whelming confurion
and conscious guilt. In the simple narra-
tion of the sacred hif~orian, ~it is set before
us with greater energy, and higher effekt
than if it had been wroughit up with all the
colouringof the moss adraired modern elo-
quence.

WNhen Joseph had a little recovered him.s

self from tlhe firRt transports of emrotion, he
]proceeds to explain his situation to his
brethrena, anad to thew them the beneficent
purposes for which he conceived himself to
be r-aised by $rovidence into power. Trhe
apology which he makes in thae text for their
former cruelty is uncommon and remnark-
able. Nowe theref~ore be not grieved nor ana-
gry ·ri·th yours Ives thcat ye SoId me hither ;
for God did f nd me before you to pref rreeyou
6a poferitys in th5e ear'th, and to save youer lives
by a great deliveranlce. So nowre it wa~cs not
ygour that Ant me hither·, but God; and he
hEath mzade mae a father to Pharaoh, and lord

oP"

of allhis houf , and a rul~er throuYghoutE all the 3 ER M.Na
landof Egypt. This apology was, in truth, I
no fatisfiaoory excuf for their crime. For
though the over-ruling Providence of H~ea-
vena had so~ diredted the course of events, as
to render dtheir bad intentions su~bse~rvient to
a happy if~ue ; yet the badness of the inten-
tion, originated entirely from themfTelves.
The envy and jealousy which they enter-
tained against their brother, led them to
thae comm~niflion of anl atrociouas deed., Tlhe
deed was voluntary; the crime was all their
own; and the interposition of Providence,
in making unfores~een conf~equenes follow
from that crime, did not, could not excul-
pate them from guilt. It were an impious
conclusion, that because God extraCds good
fr~om our evil, w~e are not answerable for
the evil which we perpetrate. Godcannot
& tempted -wi~ath thje e~vil, neither· tempteth he
any man*. But the fentimient in the texte is to
be considered as a colour which the gene-
rous humanity of Joseph prompted him to
throwy on the conduea of his brethren. H

How different is this amiable sp~irit which

Jos~eph disco~vers, from that harsh and often-
tatious superiority which too often accom-
panies the pretended forgiveness of injuries
among those who call themselves Christians!
Trhey are ready to fay, that, for their part,
they pardon the wrongs which have been
donae thern I they virifh that the persons whb
have committed them may be able to soir-
give· thems~elves ; they leave them to 0 od
and to their own cons~cience. By'thee severe
s~uggestions which they throw out, they

rit, and artfully gratify refentroent, at the XI.
time when they profess to exercis~e forgive-
ners. Wfhereas the great abnd good man,
whol~e charader we now confider, effaces
all memory of the crimes wrhich he par-
dons. H~e seeks to alleviate- the remosrfe
of his brethren by an exttenuation .of their
iguilt; and while lie is preparing; to make
their circumstances comfortable, fludies at
the fame time to render their minds easy
and tranquil.

This was not merely a tranfrent emotion

wvith Joseph, owing to the first burst of as-
feaion, on discovering hims~elf to his bre-
thren. We have a clear proof, from a re-
msarkable transaction w~hich .passed many
years after this period, of his disposition
continuing the fame to the end of life. It
iS' recorded in the lafr chapter of this book,
that wvhen'Jacob died, his sons begana to be
s~eized with fear concerning the treatment
which they might receive from their bro-
ther. The guilty are always fulfpicious.
Conscious of their owcn base~ness, they are

in capable

SER TM. incapable of conceiving the magnanimity of
xI. Others. They saw the bond, which held

the family together, now broken by their
father's death. They dreaded that the
resentment of Joseph against them had hi-
therto been only suppressed or concealed.
Th~ey said among thEemf~elves, peradvenltur~e he
weill note hate uIS, and r-equcite allgthe evil whe~ich
wzae dtid unto himi. U~nder this apprehenflon,
they firfL sent a humble message to depre-
cate his displeasure by the memory of their
common father; and then appearing in his
presence, they fell down before his face,
profefirng themselves to be his servants, and
praying him to forgive the trespass which
they had committed againf1 him. But no
s~uch hidden resentment as they dreaded had
ever lurked in the foul of Joseph. On the
contrary, when he beheld his brethren in
this arffeting situation, bereaved of their
ancient protedor, and reduced, as they
imagined, to the necefirty of holding up
their hands to him for mercy, he was over-
powered by a tide of tender emotions. so~-
feyb wzeept whe~ile his brethren /fake ulnto himn.

SE'R M*I THE firiking example~ of forgiveness

kr~a~which the text displays, ought frlequently

to oeceti to our thoughts, amidit the varioums
occasions of provocation and offence which
ar~~-ise in our intercourse with the world. If
one' to wPorthy and amiable, in the days too
of his youth and innocence, fuffered fitch
cruel treatment from hris brothers, ought
we to be f~urprifred if, even from our nearest:
relations we meet with in~juffice or ingra-
titude~ ?Wrongs and injiuries are, --more or
less, the portion of all. 1Like Death, they
are an -ev~il unaavoidable. Ndo Rtation~ is so
high, no power so great, no charadler so
unblemithied, as~ to exempt us. from· them.
Irr the wvorld, ungrateful men, fals~e friends,
and violent enethies, abound. Every wife
man ought to prepare himself for what he
-is to encounter in passing through this
thornyr region.- He ·is not to expeft that
hae can gathe~r gras esifrom thi/Hes; nor to
lose the goviernindent of' his mind, becaufie,
·ina the midst of evil maen, he is not allowed
to remain, like a secret and inviolable per-
son, untouched and uninjurred.

Remnember that no opinions which you form

loads the intentions of his enemy with ima-
ginary degrees of malice.

But admitting the injury you have re-

caeived to, be ever to ;atrociouas inl its naature,
and aggravated in its circumnitances; sup-
posing it to be even parallel to that which
Joseph f~uffered; look up, like him, to that
divine governm~ent under whicha we are all

Y 2 placed.

& ER M. placed. If ~forgivenes~s be a duty vrthich:

XI',we know God to-have required un~der the

me~ft awful f~anetions, dare we draw upon
oulrf~elvres the merited vengeance of that Su-

we fend: up to H·3eaven prayers for maercy to
ourselves, those prayers return .2ike impre-
cations upon our heads and orur very de-
vot~ions feal~ our co~ndemn~kationl .

The most pla~in· anid natural feartiments of

equity concur with divine authoritry to
enforce the duty whiicha I now recormmend.

virtue unknowna aong men, order and

gers, to human life. Inj~uries retaliated ac-
cordingE to, the excorbitant measure which

pafion

pairon prefecribes, would juitify refentrment S Ed M
in return. The injured person would be- c~
come the injurer; and thus wrongs, reta-
liations, and fresh injuries, would circulate
in endless A~ceffion, till the wor~ld w~~sas
rendered a field of blood. Of all the pas~-
Sons w~hich invade the htuman breast, re-
venge is the most direful. WThen allowed
to reign with full dominion, it is more than
fu~fficient to paifon the few pleasures which
remain to man in his prefeat state. How
much soever a persona ma~y f~ufer from in-
juffice, he is always in hazardl of f~uffering
more from the pros~ecution of revenge.
The violence of an enemy cannot in~fliaL
what is equal to the torment he creates to
hims~elf, by means of the fierce and def-
perate paiffons which he allows to rage in
his foul.,

Thiofe evil spirits who inhabit the regions

of miiery, are represented as delighting in
revenge and cruelty. But all that is great
and good in the universe, is on the fide of
clemency and mercy. The Almighty Ruler
of the world, though for ages offended by

Y 3 the

SE M.A the unrighteoufners, and insulted by the

~~ 2mpiety of men, is long-fuf~ering and flowre

to anger. Hlis Soln, when he appeared in
our nature, exhibited, both iri his life -and
his death, the moss illuffrious example of
forgiveness which the world ever beheld.
If you look into the hiffory of mankind,
yrou will find that, in every age, thos~e who
have been refpelted as worthy, or admired
as great, have been distinguished for this
virtue. Revenge dwells in little minds.
A noble and magnanimous i[pirit is always
superior to it. It fuffers not from the inju-
ries of men those severe thocks which othersi
feel. Colleded within itself, it flands un-
moved by their impotent assaults;; and withr
generous pity, rather than with anger, looks
down on their unworthy condu~t. It has
been truly said, that the- greatest man on
earth can no sooner commit an injury, than
a good man can make himself greater, by
forgiving it. Joseph, at the moment when
we now contemplate him, had entirely un-
der his power all those unnatural brethrea
who had been guilty towards him of the

~m ft

most cruel outrage which men could perpe- S E R M.
t·Irate. Hle could have ret~ained them for ever cd

.in that Egyptian bondage to which they had

once consigned him; and have gratified re-
venge ·by ,every accumulation of disgrace
which despotic power enabled him to inflia.
Had he adted this part, he might for a while
have been - soothed by the pleas~ures of his
high Rtation; but remorse, in the· end,
would have itung his foul. Cruelty twould
have rendered him unhappy within himself,
as well as odious to others; and his name
would have periflhed among the crowd of
those contemptible Rtatef~men whose adtious
stain the annals of hi~ory. ~Whereas now,
his charader Rtands among the foremoRt in
the r~anks of spotless fame. His memory is
blesSed to all generations. His example
continues to edify the world, and he himn-
self shines in the celeffial regions, as the
brightneys of the frmament, and as the fl~ars,
for ever and ever. Let us now,

. II. CONSIDER the s~entiment contained
in the text not only as a dis~covery of cor-
d1ial forgiveners, but as an exprefiron of

Y 4g devout

SER M- devount attention to the condul3t of Provi-

X I. e~B~sdence. So nowe it wras not you, that fewa me

h5ither, butf God. Remark~ how beautifully
piety and humanity are, in this instance,
conne~ted together. As we are told of
Corneillus, the good Centurion, that. his
prayers and his alms, his devotion and his
good works, came up together in memorial
bejbre G~od; so here we perceive ~fraternal
affed~ion and religious reverence, mingling
in one emotion within the patriarch's heart.
In a person of low and vulgar mind, the
se~nsations on such anp occasion wnould have
been extremely different. Looking back
on the past events of his life, he would
have aferibed all the adver-sity which he had
iifufered to the perverse treatment of his
brothers; and all the prosperity which he·
afterwards attained, to his own good con-
dua and wisdom; and by cons~equence would
have remained embittered against the infiru-
Inents of the one, and filled with pride and
felf-f~ufficiency on account of the other.
But: the elevated and noble mind of Joseph
r3ejeaed s~uch unworthy sentim-ents. Con-
templating the hand of God in all that had

befallea

~ejfallen him, he e~ffaced the remembrance 8 ER Iv£
of those evril deeds which had produced his
adversity; and for his prosperity he a~ffeaed
no praise to himsel~f, but akcribed it en-.
tirely to the will of H~eaven. Let us take
notice, that thais is not the r-efleaion o~ ah
private, retired man, whole situation might
be fusppofed to favour s~uch devout medita-
-tions. It is the-refleftion of one, who was
leading a bury and a s~educing life, in the
mnidRit of a court; the favourite of' the
greateiR monarch who was then known in
the world. Yet him you behold, amidli
the fubm~idfion anid adulation which w~as
paid to him, preserving the moderation and
limplicity of a virtuous mind; and, amnidit
the idolatry and fals~e philosophy of the
Egyptians, maintaining the principles of
true religion, and giving glory to the God
of Israel.

From this union of piety with humanity,

which is Io conspi~cuous in the sentiments of
Joseph, there arifres one very important ip-
firuftion; that a devout regard to the hand
of God in the various events of life, tends
to promote good dispositions and affetions

towards

8 ER M. towards men. It will be found by those

XIg%
~ who attend to the workings of human na-

ture, tlhat a great proportion of those ma-
lignant pations which break out in the in-
tercourf~e of men, arises from confining their
attention wholly to second caus~es, and over-
looking the firfl caus~e of all. Hence, they
are insolent in pros~perity, because they dif-
cern nothing higher than their own abili-
ties; and in adversity they are peevish and
unforgiving, because they have no objea
ion which to fix their view, buat the condua
of maena who havre aded as their enemies.
They behold no plan of wifdlomr ·or good-
neis carried on throughout nature, which
can allay the disc~ompos~ure of their maind.
As soon as their temper is ruffled, the world
appears to therm to be a continued fe~ene of
disasters and injuries, of confused events,
and of unreasonable men. Wahereas, to the
pious mran, the contemplation of the uni-
verse exhibits a very different [pedacle. In
the midst of seeming confusion he traces a
principle of order 4 and by attention to that
order his mind is harmaonized and calmed.

threatened his life. Th~fe messenger em-
played on -thais occallon was H~azael, who
appears to have been one of the princes, or ·
chief men, of the Syrian court. Chbarigedl
with rich gifts from the king, he presents
hims~elf before the prophet, and accojRs him
in terms of the highef 1refpeft. During the
conference which they held together, Elisha
fixed his eye fledfaftly on the countenance
of Hazael ? and discerning, by a prophetic
[pirit,. his future tyranny and cruelty, he
could not contain hird~elf from buriting into-

of Hlazaelabhorred, at this time, the thou hts

~~J This is the voice of hum~an natumre, while

it is not as yet haardlened in iniquity. Some
vices are indeed fmore odious to tlhe mnind
than others. Providene has wifely pointed
the iharpeft edge of this ne~ural averflon
against the crimes which are of mrr~ pernio
clous and deRmetive .nature; such as trear-
chery, oppression, and cruelt'y. But, in ge-
nerabl, the diitinbtion between moral good
and evil is so firongly marked, as to itamp
almoRt every vice with the charafter of
turpitude.. Perefent to any man, even the
mofR ignorantr and -~ntutored, an obvious,
inflance' of injustice, falsehood, or jm-
prety; let him view it in a coof: moteent,
woshen no paj~ion blinds, and no interest
warps him; and you will find that his
minj; d immePd t~ely revolts 'againft it, as
dhamefix1 and batfe, ·nay, as dseferving pu·
nithreent. HL~ence, in reasoning on the
charaaers oqf others, however men may
snifakb as to fatts, ye~tthey generally praise-
and blame according to the prirnciples of
f~ound% morality.

With

n~otorious partiality too generally mdleads ~rf~a~~
their judgment. But it is remarkable, that
no finner ever avows direfty to himself,
that he has been guilty of gross and down-
right iniquity. Even when engaged by his
passIons in the commiiron of the greatest
crimes, he; always palliates them to his own
mind by focme ext~enuation or apology, foml
pretended neceflity, or some borrowed co-
lour of innocence. Such power the unde-
niable digjnity of v~irtuae, and the acknow-
ledged turpitude of vice, poffers over every
human heart. Thes~e s~entiments are the re-
maining impreifions of that law, which was
originally written on the mind of man.
They are gleams of that light which once:
shone clear and firong within usg anld wrhich,
though it be now greatly obscured, yet con-
tinues to ihoot a feeble ray athwart the
darkness of human rtiaturTe."P-~Bu1t what-
ever sentiments of abhorrence at vice we
may at any time entertain, we have no
reason. to build up~on these a presumpt~uous
confidence of our continuance in virtue.

II. T aaT s~uch is man's igno~rance of his

own charafter, iuch the frailty of his na-
tur~e, that he may one day become infamous
for. there very orimses which at prelent he
holds in detestation. This .obfesrvation is
too well verified by the hiflory es Hazael;,
and a thousand other infliances might be
brought to confirm it. T~hough there is
.nothing wyhich every person· ought to know
so thoroughly as his owvn heart, yet frpm
.the condua· of men it appears, that there is
~nothing with which they are less acquainted.
Always more pr-one to flatter thequnfelves
than desirous to discover the truth, they
trust to their being poff~effed of every virtue
which has not been put to the trial; and
reckon themselves secure against every vice
to wghich they have not hithert~o been
tempted. .As long as their duty hangs ini
Ipeculation, it appears to plain, and to eli-
gible, that they cannot doubt of performing
it. Thie f~ulpicion never enters their mind,

- x o that

that in the hour of ipeculation, and in the 8 ER M.
hour of pradice, their featiments may differ f
widely. Their present disposition they easily
perfunde themselves will ever· continue the
fa8me; and yet that dlifpofition is changinag
with circumitances every moment.

The man who glows wNith the warm feel-

irigs of devotion, imagines it impossible for
him to 10fe tlhar-denien of the divine good-
ners which at prefeint melts his heart. Hle
whom his· friend had lately ~a~ved from ruin,
.is confident that, iif some trying emergency
thall put his gratitude to Iproo, he Will ra-·
ther die than abandon his benefaator. H~e
who lives happy and contented in frugal in-
duffry, wonders how any man can give him-
self up to dissolute pleas~ure. 1Vere any of
thos~e perfbas infbrmed by a s~uperior [pirit,
that the time was shortly to come when the
one thould prove an examplie of fecandalous
impiety, the other of treachery to his friend,
and the third of all that extravagant luxury
which disgraces a growing' fortune; fcha
of them would testify as much surprise and
iabhorresnce as H~azael did, upon hearing

Z3 the

s`& M.I thie prediftions of the prophet. Sincere

s~~19~~rthey might very possibly he in their exT

prefflons of indignation; for hypocrisy is
not alwnays to be charged on mene whose:
conduft is~ irieonfiftent·. ~H-1aaeL.'as ir4
earneflt,, when h~e refeated wi'th ~uclh irdour
the imputation of cruelty. The Apostle
Peter was findere when he' made thae zealous·
profefiron, that though he. thould go to
prison and to death wit4h his: nialler, he
would never -deny him. They were fin-
cere; that is, they s~poke from the fuhxef~s
of their hear~ts and fr~om the wKarmtha of the
Iprefeat mo'raent; but they did not know
themnfelves, as the events wvhich followed
plainly thewed. So fals~e to its principles,
too frequaently, is the heart of maxi; so weak
-is the found ation of human virtue ; so much
reason there is for what the Goifpel perpe-
tually inculcates concerning the necefirty of
d~iffruffing ourselves, and de ~nding on di-
vine aid. MVortifying, I donfefs, is this
vriew of hainan nature; yet pr'oper to be
ptternded to by ·all, in order to efieape the
soft; fatal dangers. For, merely through un-

guarded

guarded conduQt, and from the want of this S E R M.
prudent s~uspicion of their owen woeaknefs,
how many, after the most promising begin-
nings, have gradually apofittized from every
principle of virtue; until, at lass, it has be-
come as difficult for one to believe, that they
ever had any love of goodness, as it would
~have been once to have persuaded them-
selves that they were to advance to such a
height in wrickednefs ?

IN su~ch eases as I have deferibed, what

has become, it may be inquired, of those
featiments of abhorrence at guilt whicha
wvere once felt so fkrongly Z Are they to-
tally erased ? or, if in any degree they re-
mnain, how do such persons contrive to
fat~fsfy them~selves in a~ting a part which
their maindls condem~n?-·Hleere there is ab
mygfiery of iniquity which requires to be
uanfolded. Latent and s~ecret is the pro-
gref~s of corruption within the: foul; and
the more latent·, the more darngeroup is its
growth. No man becomes of a s~udden
sompletely wicked. Guilt never tlhews its

Z 4 whole

SE ~.M whole deformity at once; but by gradual

s~J acquamntance reconciles us to its appearance,

and imperceptibly di-ffuf~es its poison through
all the powers of the mind. Every man
has some darling pafflon, which generally
aflFords. the sirs introdlu~iott to vice. T~he
irregular gratifications into which it occa-
fionally se~duces him, appear lunder~ the form
of venial wreaknef~es; and are indulged in
the beginning, with ferupuloufnefs~ and re-
serve. But, by longer -pradice, there re-
firaints wNeaken, 'and the power of habit
grows. One vice brings in another to its
aid. By a fort of natural affnity they con-
neat and entwine thems~elves together; till
their roots come to, be Ep~read wide and deep
over all the foul. W~hen guilt rises to be
glaring, cons~cience endeavours to remon-
firate. But cons~cience is a calm principle.
Pafflon is loud and impetuous; and creates
a tumult which dfrowns the voice of reason.,
It joinns, besides, artifice to violence; and
seduces at the fam'e time that it impels.
F~or it employs the underfltanding to impos~e
upon thaeconfeience. It devises reasons

and

and arguments to juffify the corrutptions oiF 8ER ht,
the heart. The common pra~tice, of the ~~
world is appealed to. Nice diftin~tionas are
m~ade. Men are found to be circumitanced
in to pecul~iar a manner, as to render cer-
tain aations exculable, if not blameless,
whichl, in another situation, it is confeffed,
would have been criminal. By fach a proc
cess as this, there is reason to believe, - that
a great part of mankind advance from fiep
to fiep in fin, partly hurried by passion,
and partly blinded by f~elf-deceit, without
any juff s~ense~ of the degree of guilt which
they contra&t. By' inveterate habits, their
judgment is, at length, perverted, and their
mnoral feelings are deadened. T~hey fee now
with other eyes; and can loolk withoutrpain
on evil aaions which they formerly ab-
horred.

It is ]proper, ho~wever, to observe, that

though our native fentituents of abhorrence
at guilt may be so borne down, or so, eluded,
as to los~e their influence on condua, yet
those sentiments belonging originally to our
frame, and being never totally eradicated

froma

sER m. from thle foul, will Afkil retairn so much aua-

~kqPIP thorityr as if not to reform, at least, on some

ocentions, to chasten the finner. It is only
during a coubrfe of prosperity, that vice is
able to carry on its delusions without dif-
turbacce. But amidst the dark and thought..
ful situations of life, cons~cience regains its
rights; and pours the whole bitterness of
remaorfe on his heart, who has apostatized
from his original principles. We maywell
believe that, before the end of his days,
ItHazael's first imprefirons would .be made
to return. In the hour of adversity, the
E~reembranlce of hnis conferfence with the
venerable Prophet would fling his heart.
Comparing the sentiments which, in those
his bettelr days, he felt with the atrocious
cruelties wmhich hae h-aad afterwgards commnrit-
ted, all the honours of royalty would be
uanable to save ]him froina the inward se~nse
of baienefs and infamy.

FRolvi this viewc wThich has been exhi-

'bited of the progress of corruption, and of
the danger to which we are exposed, of

the power which corruption acqluires to
lpervert the original priaciples of man, is
frequently owing to a change of their cir-
cumfiadrnces anad condition in the ~world.
HHow different was H~azael the sneffenger

The feeds of various qualities, good andB

bad, lie in1 all our hearts. But until pros-
per occasions ripen and bring them fo~r-
waard, `they lie there inadtive and dead.
T~hey are covered~ up and concealed within
the recesses of our nature ; or, if they spring:
up at tall, it is under such an appearanc~e as
is frequently mistaken, even by ours~elves.
Pride, for initance, in certain firuations,
has no opportunity of displaying itself, but
as maagnanmif~ty, or sense of honour. Ava.T~~i
rice appears as nec'ifiary and lau~dable Qcc-
nomyp. ~What in one flation of life would
discover itielf to be cow~ardice and baseness
o~f Pmindf, passes in another for prudent c~ir-

cuamfpedion.

SE R M~. cumfpeaion. What in the fulness~ of po~wet

,~CI' .would prove to be cruelty and opprefilon,

is reputed, in a subordinat~e rank, no ·more
than the exercis~e of proper difciplinie. For
a while, the: man is known neither by the
·world nor by himself, .to.be what· he truly,
is. But bring him into a new situation of
life, which accords .with his predominant
dieflpolition; which strikes on certain latent
qualities of his foul, and awakens t~hpm into
salton; and as the leaves of a flowzer gra-
dually unfold to the fun, so shall1 all his true
c~haraaer open full to view.

Tghis.may, in one light, be accounted

not so much an alterat~ion of charadter pro-
duced by a change of circumstances, as a
d~iscovery brought forth of the real charader,
wYhich formerly lay concealed. Yet, at the
fame times, it is true that the man hnieflelf un-
(dlergoes a.change. Fo~r oapportunity being
gi~ven for certain difpolitions, which had
been dormant, to exert themselves withoutr
redtraint, they of couarfe~ gather firength.
By means of the ascendancy which they
gain, other parts of the temaper: are borne

P5 down ;

do~wn; - anrdl thus an alteration is made in SBE~R
the ·whole firuature and yrrrem of the foul.
He is a truly wife and good man, woho,
through divine assistance, remains s~uperior
to this influenee of fortune on his cha-i
rader, who having once imbibed -worthy
f~entiat~ents, and established proper principles
of altio~n, continues conflant to there,
whatever his circumstances be; maintains,
throughout all the changes of his life, one
uniform and supported tenour of condua;
and what he abhorred as evil and wicked in
the beginning of his days, continues to ab-
hors to the end. But how rare is it to meet
with this honourable consistency among
men, while they are passing through the
difkrent flations an~d periods of life i When
they -are se~tting out in the world, befo*cre
their· -mrinds have been greatly millkd or

·until we examine withi care int6 -the fipirt
and meaning of the femtintenlts here de-
fi'vered.

Iht is evident that the wife man does not:

prefer sorrow, upon its own account, to
mirth; or repres~ent s~adness as a sl~ate more
eligible than joy. He considers it in the
light of discipline only. H-e views it with~
reference to an end. He compares it with
certain improvements which he fuppoles it
to prod uce ; whben the heart is made better-
by the faa'nef~ of th7e countenfance, Land .the

are founid to refualt from occallonal sadness,
there, s~ure, may be capable of giving it the
preference to fomre fleeting f~erdations of joy.,

WThen he prefers f'orrow to laughter,~ he is
not to be under flood as prohigiting all mirth;
as reqluiring us to wear~ a perpetual cloud on
our brow, and tq fequefirate ourselves fr-ont
:every cheerful entertainment of social life,
Such an interpretation would be inconsistent
wtith many other exhortations in: his own
writings, which recommend etemperate and
Snnocent joy. It would not s~uit with the
~proper dilcharge of the duties which he-
·1osg, to us as members of society; and
·woold be most opposit~e to the ·goodgnefs ;and
Ibgrigesity of our Creator. T~he true scope
of his doarine in this passa~ge is, that there
is a certain~temper and slate of heart, which
.is of far gre$ater consequence to real happi-
.ness, than the habitual indulgence of giddy
and thouglutlefs mirth; that for the attain-
.mnent and cultivation of this temper, fr-e-
quent returns of gravse refleation are necef~

fary;

fary; that, upon this account, it is p~rofitable S E ~M.ilr
to give admif sion to th~ierevie~ws f humnan

t~ro in the minad; and tha.t thna; frnota .the

fei~atiments wh6ich - purpobfe at prefeat to
ju~ifyr:and recormimend, .as r~ooR fitable to
the chlra~ter of mnen and of Chr~ifians; and
not in - the least inconsistent w~ith.pleafapre,
right~ly underflood.

Amnong the variety of difpolitions, wvhich

are to be found in the worldu~, £omae indeed
require less of this dificipline than others.
There are perfbne whole terider and deli-
cate sensibility, eit'her derived from nature,
or brought on by repeated affliftions, ren-
ders themn too deeply s~usceptible of evlery
mournful imprefiron; whose Cpirits Rand
more in need of being fopported and cheer-·

views of human life. In such cafes we are

67pd this is far from being the co~mmorn difpoli-

tion of men. Their minds are in general in-
clined to levity, much more than to thoughts~
ful melancholy; and their hrearts more apt
to be contraaed and hardened,than to relent
with too m~uch facil-ity. I thallt therefore
endearvourP to thew them, wrhat bad inclina-
tionms their com~pliance with Siolomn's ad-
vice would correQ; what good difpofmtions,
with refpceQ to God, their neighbours, and
themfielves, it would improve; and how,
upon the whole, his dloarine is v~erified,
that By the fadrneSJ of the~ countenanpce the
beart~ is mrade ~bettr.

I BEGIN by observing, that the temper

recommended in the text faits the present
conflitution of things in this world. Had
rnan been defaine d so a course of undif~-
turbed enjoyment, perpetual gaiety would
then have corereponded to his slate; and
pensive thought have been an unnatural
intruliton. B3ut in a slate wt~here all is

fperity without a reverfie, and no joy without ap
its attending griefs, wihere from the house of
~feaiting all mull, at one time or other, pas~s
into the hous~e of mourning, it would be
equally unnatural if no admifLi~on were given
to grave refletion. The mind of man muit
be attemnpered to his condition. Providence,
wvhole wisdom is conspicuous in all its works,
has adjuited with exas proportion the in-
ward powers to the outward Rtate of everya
rational being. It has for this purpose im-
planted the serious and iympathetic feelings
in our nature, that they might coi-refpond
whith thne vricifirtudes of fbnovrro in our lot.
Hle who endeavours to repel their influence,

difpolition towards our fellowP-creatulres, as

just obs~ervation, that they who have lived
always in affluene and ease, firangers to
thae' rmileroies of life, are liable to contra&h
brardnef~s of heart with refpea to all the
concerns of others. Wr~apped up in them-
felvees, and their own pl~easures, they. be-
hold with indiffrence the most aff~eding
~feenes of diffrefs. Habituated to indulge
all their desires without control, they be-

between the human foul abnd this ~earth,
8which was only design~ed for its temporary

alienate its desires fr~oma God and he~aven,
and dejea it with flavilh and unmanly fears
of death. Whereas, by the discipline of
religious se~riousness, it is gradually loosened

it is necessary that the divine perfeetions be

opens a more wonderful p~roipeca of the adi-

from the corruption of human nature in

fore the world the divine perlfeaions in the

the purporesl of moral and religious im-

IN the firit place, Let it lead us to a. reli-i

hold a very mixed and busy fecene; the
pafflons of men variously agitated, and new
changes daily taking place upon this Rage
of tim~e. W7e behold peace anad war alter-
natelly returninrg; the fortunes of private
men rising and falling; and slates and na-
tions partal'ing of the fame vicissitude. In

of externall causes, and to thie mere rotati~on

but also, in one that thall undoubtedly be
fuccefsful. For: we are here assured by, the
divine promise, that truth and righteoulonefs
thall at length prevail, and that the ins

hereafter; what benefit does he receive, in
thete~ refpeAs, from religious knowledge and
beli~ef~ ? t is obvious, thatr all increase~ of
knowledge is improvement to the under-

larged, the greater numnber of" objeas that
are submitted to its view, esp~ecially when
these objeds are of intrinsic excellence, the

Bult were the knowledge of religion merely
speculative, though the Epeculation must be
admitted to be noble, yet less could be fagid
of its importance. We recommend- it to
mankind, as so ng the heart, and dire&*·
ing the life. Titiofe pure and exalted con-
ceptions which the Chiri~itan religion has
taught us to entertain of the ]Deityr, as the
ulniverf~al Father: and righteous Govrernor
of the universe, the Standard of unfplotted
perfeation ; and the Author of every good and
perfet g~if't; conduaing his whole admnini-
fkration with an eternal regard to order,
veirtue, and truth ; ever favouring the caus~e,
and supporting~ the intereits, of righteous
mraen; and applying, in this direaion, the
whole might of omnipotence, and the whole
council of unerring wis~dom, from the be-
ginning to the end of things; such concep-
tions both kindle devotion, and itrengthen
virtue. They give fortitude to the mind in

All the doarines peculiar to the Golpel

are great improvements on what- the light
of nature had imperfealy f~uggeited. ; A.
high dispens~ation of Providence is made
known, particularly faited lto he exigencies
of man ; calculated for ree ~jg himn from
that corrupted Rtate into w~ experience
bears witness that Ihe is 1fallen, andc for re-
Rtoring him to integrity, and favour with his
Creator. Tkhe niethod of carrying on this
great plan is such as gives us the most Arik-
ing views of the importance of righateoul-
ness or virtue, and of th'e high account in
whicch it flands ~with God. Tlbhe Son of
God appeared on the earth, and fuffered as
a propitiation for the fins of the world,
with this expres~s intention, that he might
brinrg in everlaJf ing righteoufnes;; that he
might fucrge our consciences from dead wz~orks
to Seree the livinzg God; that he mi ~ght r~e-
deema us from all ~iniquity, and furt~fy un-
to hinfl`ef a peculiar- people xealouls of goodb
weorKs. Sucha a merciful inter~position of

his concern for the moral intereits of man-

fagtisfying grotmnd of confidence and truit.

WVhile the divine government is thus

encouraging to every virtuous mind, there
is, at the fame time, something extremely
awful and folemnn in the whole do~trine of

firation. It points at some deep malignity

moved the Sovereign of the world to de- xv.
part from the ordinary course of Providence,
and to bring about the refftoration of his
fallen creatures by a method so afaonifhing.
MJ3ankind are hereby awakened to the most
fierious refle~tions. Such ~s are opened
of the fagndity of the di *laws, of the
fi~riatnels~ of the divine juffice, of the im-
portance of the part which is afirgned them

human life, and add dignity and folemnnity
to virtue. These great purpoles are farther
carried on, by the discovery which is made
of the fixed connexion in which this life
flands with a fu~ture eternal state. We are
represented as fwzeing· now~e, wha/Jt woe are to
reap hereafter ; undergoing a course- ls pro-
bation and trial, wh~ich, according as it ter-
mainates in our improvement, or leaves us
unreformed and corrupted, will d~ilmifs usxf
to lasting abodes, eithner ofpunifhlentt or

ritative fanalon given to a. law ; the Gover-
nor and Judge revealed;' and all the ma-
tives which can operate on hope and fear,
brought home Athe heart, with, Thus faith
the Lordoflfof~s. In aword, a great and
magnificent plan of divine adm~inifkration is
opened to us in the Golpel of Christ ; and
nothing is omitted that can impress; mankind
with the pers~uasion of their being all, in
the ftriaeft s~ens~e, fubjedts of the mnond
governm~ent of G3od,

THovouGE the bounds of this Difourfe-

allow us to take only an imperfea view of
the principles of Christian doarine, yet the
hlints which have been given, lay a filfficient
foundation for appealing to every imr
partial mind, whether the knowledge and
belief of such principles be not intimately
conne~ted with the improvement, and, by
ponfiequence, with the happiness of mna ?

I realop~

% reafori now with such as admit, that virtue S EXR MI.
is the great source both of improvement 4
and happineis. Let them lay what firefs
they please upon the authority of conscience,
and upon the force and evidence of its dic-
tates; can they refus~e to allow that the
natural tendency of the principles which I
have mentioned, is to fuppor't,thofe didates,
and to confirm that authority; to excite,
on ·variousa occasions, the most useful se~nti-
ments; to provide additional restraints fronm
vice, and additional motives to every virtue?
WMho dares pronounce, that there is no cafe
in wthich confie~ince flands in need of fuach
afiftaance to direa, where there is to much
uncertainty and darknes~s; and to prompt,
wmhere there is to much feebleness and~ irre-
folutionm, and such a fatal proneness to vice
abnd f 0117 ?

But how good soever the tendency of

religious principles may be, fbom wnill still
call in question their aatual significancy,
annd influence ona life. T~his tendency is
by various causes defeated. Between the
belief of religious principles and a corre-

' ~Fs 3 fpondent

SE ~M. fpondent pradtice, it will be alleged that

b-y--~frequent experience thews there is no ne-

ceffary connexion; and that therefore the
propagation of the one, cannot give us any
afforance of proportionable improvements
following in the other.--This, in part, is
gr~anted to be true; as we admit that reli-
gious knowledge and belief are susceptible
of various degrees, before th~ey arrive at that
real Christ~ian faith which the S~cripture re-
prefentcs as fu~~JjLrzfyi~hngthehat But though
the connexion between principle and prac-
tice be not necesSary andi invariable, it will
not, I fuLppofe, be denied, that there is some
connexion. H E-ere then one avenue to the
heart is opened. If the tendency of reli-
gious knowledge be good, w~ifidorn must
dire&, and duty oblige us to cultivate it.
For tendency will, at leafs in some cafes,
rife into efek~t; and, probably, in more
cafes than are knowjn and observed by the
wilorld. BEefides the dillinguifhed examples
of true religion and virtue which have, more
or less, adorned every age of the Christian
era, what numbers may there be, in the

m1~~ore

mnore silent and private ficenes of life, over- S ER M.
lookred byE,~ superficial observers of ~mankind, ;e
on whole hearts and lives religiouas prin-
ciples have the moffl happy influence ? Even
on loose and giddy minds, where they are
far from accomplishing their full effeat, their
influence is, frequently, not altogether loft.
ImprefiTons of religion often check vice in
its career. They prevent it from proceed-
ing its utmost length·; and though they do
not entirely reform the offender, they serve
tpo maintain order in faciety. Perso~ns who
are nowv bad, might probably have been
wB~orfe witlhout them, andl thae world hlave
fuff~ered moire jfrom unrefkrainedl licenztiouf--
nel~s. They often sCow latent feeds osgood-
ness in the heart, which proper circumn-
stances and occasions afterwards ripen;
though the reformation of the o~ffender may
not be to conspicuous as his former enor-
mtities have been. Fr1omB athe native ten-
dency of religious belief, there is reafbn to
conclude, that tho~se good effeats of it are
not so rare as some would represent them.
B3y its nature and tendency, we can better

Fs 4 judge

SE Rv.R- judge of its effeats, than by obfervatIotis

Lrqpd drawn from a s~upposed experience, which

often is narrow in its comnpafs, and fallacious~
in its conclusions.

T~he adual influence of principle and be-

lief on maankind, adm~its of clear il~luff~iriato
from oxnconteited matter of fa(E, Thiey·
wh~lto hold the good effees of Chriitian pris-
ciples to be to inconfidlerable, as to rendet
the prop-agation of thern of fmnall import-
ance, will be at no loss to, give us initances
·of corrupt principles of belief having had
the moRt powerful influence on the world.
Loud complaints we hear from this quarter
of the direful efe~as wh~ich fuper~ition and
enthuf~iati have produced ; of their having
poisoned the tempers, and transformed the
mnarners of men; of their having over-
come the ftrongeit reftrainlts of law, of rea-
son, and humanity. Is this then the cafe,
that all principles, except good ones are of
fouch mighty energy ? Strange ! that falke
religion thould be able to do fo.much, and
true religion so little; that';belief, so piow-;
erfid in the one cafe, thould· be so impo-

tent

tent in the other.--No knpartial inqluire@i SEanR I
&`rely, can entertain this opinion. The dfTL
whole hiffory of mankind thews that their
r~eligious tenets and principles, of whatever
nature they be, are of great influence in
forming their charadter, and dire~ting their
cotndud1. TFhe mis~chief which false prin-
ciples have done, affords a good argument
to guard carefully against error; but as it
is a proof of what belief can do, it gives
ground to hope the more from it, when
rightly dire~ted. T~he ame torrent which,
when it is put out of its natural course~,
overflows and lays wafle a. country, adorns
and enriches it, when runmong in its pro-
per channel. If it be alleged that s~uper-
flition is liktely to be more powerful in its
e~fefts than truth, because it agrees better
wvithn the follies and corrulptions of the world8,
we may oppos~e to this, on the other
haand, that truth~ has the divine blefli-ng and
th8e countenance of H-eavsen 'on its fide.
Let us always hope well of a cause that is
good in itself, and beneficial to mankind.
Truth is mighty, and will prevail. Let us

s~pread

S ER M. [pread the inzcorrupztible feed as widely as we

can, and trust in ·God that he will give the
Iste.reale.-H~aving thus thewn the import-
aLne of religious knowledge to mankind is
the way of ireprovemaent, let, us,

IN the f~econdq place, confider it in the

light of consolation; as bringing aid and
relief to u~s amidf1e the difirlfe~~-s of li~fe.
Hlere ·religion inconteftibly triumphs; and
its happy effeats, in this refp~ea, furnish a
firong argumlent to every benevolent mind
for withing thema to be farther diffufed
throughout the world. For without the
belief antd hope afforded by divine Reve-
lation, the circumilancess of man are iex-
tremely forlorn. He finds himself placed
here as a firanger in a vast~ univ~erfei, w~here
the powers and operations of N\Yature are
very imperfea,1y known; where both the
beginnings and the issues of things are in-
volved in myfierious darkners; where he
is unable to discover, with any certainty,
\whence he diprung, or- for wihat ]purpose he
was brought into this flrate of existence;

whi Lether

wnhether he be f~ubjeaed to the government: SER M.
of a mild, or of a wrathful ruler ; what con- V
fkrudion he is to put on many of the dif-
penfa8tions of his providence ; and what his
fate is to be when hie departs hence. WVhat
a dis~consolate situation to a feriouls inqbuir-
ing mind ! The greater degree of virtue it
poffreffes, its. fenfbilityJ is likely to be the
rnore oppressed by this burden of labouring
thought. Evren though it were in one's
power to banish all uneasy· thought, and to
fill up the hours of life with perpetual
amulement, life so filled up would, upon
refletion, appear poor and trivial. But
thes~e are far from being the terms upon
which man is brought into this world. He
is cons~cious that his being is frail and
f~eeble; he f~ees himnfelf beset wyith variouls
dangers; and is expose~d to many a me-
lancholy apprehenflon, from the evils
which he may have to encounter, before he
arrives at the close of liife. In this diffrejffed
condition, to reveal to him~ gAch discoveries
of the Supreme Being as the Christian reli-
gion affords, is to reveal to him a F~ather

9 and

S E It iV and a Friend; is to let in a ray of the moik

~47, cheering light upon the darknes~s of the hul

mran, e~Late. HBe who wtas before a delti-
tute orphan, wandering in the inhos~pitable
des~ert, has now gained a thelter from the
bitter and inclement bladt. He now knows
to whoam to pray, and in whom to truit;
wh~ere to unboso~m his forrovws, andc frorm
~what hand to look' for relief.

It is certain that when the heart -bleeds

from some wou~nd of recent misfortune,
nothing is of equal efficacy with religious
comfort. It is of power to enlighten the
darkeRt hour, and to afi-uagC the fe~vereit
woe, by the belief of divine favour, and
the profpe61 of a blessed immortality. In
such hopes the mind exspatiates with joy ;
and, when bereaved of its earthly friends,
folaces itsel~f with the thoughts of one Friend,
wIho Bwil~l never forla~ke It. R~elmned rea-
foning~s concerning thle nature of the hu-
mnan condition, and thie improvemIent w~hich
]philosophy teaches us to make of every
event, may entertain the mind when it is
at ease; may perhaps contribute to sooth

it when slightly touched with sorrow, SER M.
But when it is torn with any fore diitreifs, xv.
they are cold and feeble, compared with a b~~
direst promise from the word of God.
This is an anchor to the S ul both fare and
fedtfaji. This has given consolation and
refuge to many a virtuous heart, at a time
when the moit cogent reasonings would
have proved utterly unavailing.

UJpon the a~pproach of death, es~pecially

w~hen, if a run thinks at all, his anxiety
about his future interei~s muRt naturally in-
crease, the power of religious consolation is
sensibly felt. Then appears, in the most
fkriking light, the high value of the difcco-
veries made by the Golpel y not only life
and Smm~ortality revealed, but a MCediator
with God discovered; mercy proclaimed,
through him, to the frailties of the penitent
and the humble; andi his prelence pro-
mrnied to be with themn when they are pass-
Ing through the lalley of~ the }badiowe of
death, in order to bring them safe into un-
seen habitations of reit and joy. Here is
gr-ound for their leaving the world with

comfort

.E R M. comfort and peace. But in this severe and
pXVp ~ trying period, this labouring hour of na-

ture, how thall the unlhappy man f~upprt
himse~lf, who knows not, or believes not,
the difcdoveries of religion ? Secretly confci-
ous to hims~elf that he has not a~ted his part
as hie ought to have done, the fins of his-
past life arise~ before him i'n fad .remem-
brance. H-e wishes to exilt after death,
and yet dreads that existence. The Go-
vernorP of the wrorld is unknowa. H1-$e can-
not tell whether every endeavour to obtain
his mercy may not be vain. All is aw-
ful obscurity around him; and in the midfl:
of endless doubts and p~erplexities, the trem-
bling, relucaant foul is forced away from
the body. As thre misfortunes of life muia,
to such a man, have been mnoR oppressive,
fJo its end is bitter. gHis funl sets in a dark
cloud ; and the night of death clofres over
his head, fuill of mniferyr.-H~-aving now
thew~n how important the lentow~edgc~e of the
Lorda is, both to the imnprovement and the
consolation of man, considered as an indi-
vidual, I amn next to th~ewJ,

Il. H~ow important this knowledge is to SER M.·

him as a member' of faciety. This branch d
of the f~ubjeat is in part anticipated by wvhat
has been s~aid. For all the improvement
wplhich man receives as an individual, re-
dounds to the benefit of the public. Society
reaps the fruit of the virtues of all the memb-
berss who compoile it; and in proportion as
each, apart, is made better, the whv~ole must:
flourish.

But, besides this effea, religious k~now-

ledge has a dired tendency to improve the
social intercourse of men, and to afifT~ them
in co-operating for common good. It is
the great infirument of civilizing the mul-
titude, and forminlg them to union. It
tames the fierceners of their pa~irons, and
gfofens tlhe rudenes~s of their manners.
Tfhere is mulkch reason to doubt ~whether
any regular faciety ever fu~brified, or could
subsist, in the world, deflitu~te of all reli-
gious ideas and principles. Thiey who, in
early times, attempted to bring the wan-
dering and scattered tribes of men f'rom the
wFoods, and to unite them in cities and

com-a

8 ER M~. communities, always found it necessary to,

~ begin with some inflitution of religion.

The wisest legislators of old, through the
whole progress of their iyfiems of govern--
ment, considered religion as ess~ential to civil
polity. If even thos~e imperfeft forms of
it, loaded with so much` fuplerflition and
error, (were important to the. welfare of-
society, how much more that reasonable
worship of the true God, which is taught
by the Golpel ? True religion introduces
the idea of regular thbje~tion, by a~ccuf
toming mankind to the rawer of superior
power in the Deity, joined with the vene-
ration of fouperior wrifdom and goodlnefs~.
It is by its nature an aflociatwng principle;
and creates ne~w and sacred bonds of union
aImong men. Commlon assemblies for reli-
gious worship, and joint homage offered
up to one God ; the sense of .being all de-
pendent on the f-ame prote~tion, and bound
to duty by the fame ties, tharers in the
fame benefits of heaven, and expcetants of
the Irame rewa~rd, tend to awaken the fe-n-
timnents of friendly relation, and to confirnJ

? 2 an o

and fkrengthen our mutual conn'exion. The S EXRVM
doltrine of Christianity is moit advers~e to co
all ty ranny and oppreifion, but highly fa-
vourable to the interests of good government
among men. It represses the s~pirit of li-
centiour~efs and sedition. It inculcates the
duty of fiubordination to lawful superiors.
It requires us to fear God, to honour the king,
and not to meddale w~ith themz that ar-e given
to change.

Religious knowledge forwards all ufefunl

and ornamental improvements in faciety.
Experience thew~s, that, in proportion as it
diffufe~s its light, learning flourishes, and
liberal· arts are cultivated and advanced.
JuRt conceptions of religion promote a free
and manly [pirit. They lead men to think
for themselves; to form their principles
upona fair inquiry, and not to resign their
cons~cience to the diftates of men. ~Hence
they naturally inspire aversion to flaveryT of
every kind; and promote a taste for liberty
and laws. ]Delpotic governments have ge-
nerally taken the firmeRt root among nations
that were blinded by Mlahomaetan or Pagan

gion. In the Christian world, during those
centuries in which gross fuperflition held
its reign undiflurbed, oppression and slavery
wvere in its train. The cloud of ignorance
fat thick and deep over the nations; and
;the world was threatened with a relaple into
ancient barbarity. As soon as the true
knowledge· of th~e L~ord revived, at .the aufpi4
cious aera of the Reformation, learning,
liberty, and arts, began to thine forth with
it, and to refutme their luffre.

]But the happy influence which religion

exerts on fockcty, extends mnuch f~art~her than
to effeits of this kind. It is not only sub-
fidiary to the improvement, but necessary to
the preservation of society. It is the very
basis on which it rests. Religious prin-
ciple is what gives men the surest hold of
one another. That last and greatest pledge
of veriacity, an oath, without which no fov·
clety could f~ubift, derives its whole autho-
rity from an eftablithedl reverence of God,
49 w~hpma it is a solemn appeal. Banish re-

ligious

ligious· principle, and you loosen all the SER M.
bonds which conned mankind to ether; * xv
you thake the fundamental pillar of mutual
confidence and trust; you render the recoi
rity arifintg from laws, in a great meduiire,
voi~d and ineffetauall. FEor humalan laws and
humann fanaions cannot exrtenad to nurmber.
less cafes, in which the fagfety of mankind
is deeply concerned. They would prove:
very feeble infiruments· of order and peace,
if there wrere no checks upon the conduat
of men from the s~ense of divine legifiation;
if no belief of future rewards and punish-;
ments were to overawe conscience, and to
supply the defeats of human government.

Indeed, the belief of religion is of such

importance to public wvelfare-, that the most
expressive defeription we could give ofa
society of men in the utmof1 disorder, would
be to fay, that there was no fear of God
left among thema. Imagination would im-
mediately conceive of them as abandonaed to
r-apine and violenc~e, to perfidy and treachery;
las deceiving and deceived, oppreifing and
opprefibdt; consumed by intelline broils,

G g and

S EXRVM. and rip~e for becoming a pey to the' sirs

~ invader. On the other hand, in order to

form the idea of a fbciety flourithinga in its
highest glory, we need only conceive the
belief of Christian principle exerting its full
influence on the heart~s and lives of all the
m~embers. Instantly, the most amiable fene
would open to our view. We thould fee
the caufaes of public disunion removed, when
mnen were animated with that: noble spirit of
love and charity which our religion breathes;
andi formed to the pursuit of those- higher
interests, which give no occasion to compe-
tition and jealousy. We thould fee families,
neighbourhoods, and communities living in
unbroken amity, and purfiing, with one
]heart and mnind, the commnon interest; so-
briety of manners, and simplicity o~f life,
reffored; virtuous induffry carrying on its
plfeful lalbour-s, and cheerful contentment:
every where reignin g. Politicians may lay
down what plans they pl'eafe: for advancing
public prosp7erity ; but, in truth, it is th~e
prevalency of such princip~les of religion and.
virtue which forms the fkrength and glory

8 of

of a nation. When thes~e are totally want- SER Mr.
ing, no measures contrived by human wis- ra
dom can fu~pplyr tlhe defeat. In proportion
as they prevail, they raise the slate of *so-
clety from that fad degeneracy into which
it is at prefeat f~unk, and carry it forward,
under the blefling of H~eaven, towards that
happy period, when gation }h5all not I~ft up
th~eir /word agadinfl nation, nor learn wear-
aaany more.

In order to prove the importance of reli-

gious ktnow~ledge to the interest of society,
one consideration mnore,~ dese~rving particua-
lar attention, Yremains to be mentioned. It
is, that if good fs~ be not sown in the field,
tare~s will infalliboly spring up. The pro-
pension towards religion is firong in the
humnan heart. T~here ]is a natural prelpa-
ration in our mmids for receiving some
imapreffons of s~upernatural belief. Uport
ther~e, among ignorant and u~ncultivaated
men, fuaperflitionl or enthufaiam never fail
to graft themfielves. Into what maonfirous
forms thes~e have fjhot forth, and whtat vra-
rious mlifchiefs they have produced to so-~

ciety,

8 ER M. elety, is too well known. , Nor is this thdJ

~ whole of the danger. Designing men are
always ready to take advantage of this po-
pular weaknel~s, and to direat the f~uperfi-
tious bias of the mnultirtude to their own amma
bi~tious an'd interefi~ed ends. Superftitioni
in itse~lf a, formidrable evil, threatens conf~e-
q~uence6 flill more formidable, when it is
rendered the tool of design and craft. Hence
arises one of the molt poweirful arguments
for .propagating with zeal, as far as our in-
fluence can extend, _ the pure and undefiled
doalrines of the Goipel of Christ ; in order
that juff and rational principles of religion
anay fill up that room in the minds of men,

Tihis con~filderation alone is f~ufficient to

thew the high utility of the design ulndler-
taken by the Society for propagating Chris~
tian Knowledge. With great propriety,
they have beffow~ed their chief attention on
a, remote qluarter of our country, wvhere,
from a variety of caules, ignorance .and f~ua
perftition had gained more ground, than ine

%Ix any

any other corner of the land; wh-ere the 8 E R.

inhabitants, by their local situation, were i
more imperfealy su~pplied with the means
of proper education and initrudion ; and at
the fame time exposed to the 1eduations of
fruchm as fought to pervert them from the
truthi. The laudlable endeavours of .thise
Society, in di~fufing religious and dekfri
knowledge through this part of the country,
have already been crowned with much Auc-
pcers; and more is flill to be expelted from
the contintuance of their Ipious and well-
direated attention.

With such good designs, it becomes all

to co-operate, who are lovers of mankind.
Thus shall they thew their juff: sense of the
value of that blessing which they enjoy, in
the knowledge of the Goirpel of Christ;
and their gratitude to Heaven for confer-
ring it upon them. Thus shall they make
the blefirngs of those who are now ready
to peri/h throudgh l~ack of~ Knowledge, des~cend
upon their heads. Thus shall they cont~ri-
Ibute their endeavours for bringing forwvard
Bat happy period, foretold by ancient pro-

phecy ;

*,.. .. all the ear-th, and his name one ; -when that:

naame jZ all be great from the rynzg to thSee f-
