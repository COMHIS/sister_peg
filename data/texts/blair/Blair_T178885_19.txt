ON THE DUTIES OF THE YOUNG.

The uncertainty of the enjoyments of human life
checks presumption; the multiplicity of its dangers
demands perpetual caution. Moderation, vigilance,
and self-government, are duties incumbent on all; but
especially on such as are beginning the journey of life.
The scenes which present themselves, at our entering
upon the world, are commonly flattering. . What-
ever they be in themselves, the lively spirits of the
young gild every opening prospect. The field of hope
appears to stretch wide before them. Pleasure seems
to put forth its blossoms on every side. Impelled by
desire, forward they rush with inconsiderate ardour:
Prompt to decide, and to chuse; averse to hesitate, or
to inquire ; credulous, because untaught by experience ;
rash, because unacquainted with danger; headstrong,
because unsubdued by disappointment. As
soon as you are capable of reflection, you must per-
ceive that there is a right and a wrong in human actions.
You see that those who are born with the same ad-
vantages of fortune, are not all equally prosperous in
the course of life. While some of them, by wise and
steady conduct, attain distinction in the world, and
pass their days with comfort and honour; others, of
the same rank, by mean and vicious behaviour, forfeit
the advantages of their birth, involve thenmrelves in
much misery, and end in being a disgrace to their
friends, and a burden on society. Early, then, you

may learn, that it is not on the external condition in
which you find yourselves placed, but on the part
which you are to act, that your welfare or unhappiness,
your honour or infamy, depend. Now, when begin-
ning to act that part, what can be of greater moment,
than to regulate your plan of conduct with the moit
serious attention, before you have yet committed any
fatal or irretrievable errors ? If, instead of exerting
reflection, for this valuable purpose, you deliver your-
selves up at so critical a time, to sloth and pleasure;
if you refuse to listen to any counsellor but humours
or to attend to any pursuit except that of amusement;
if you allow yourselves to float loose and careless on;
the tide of life, ready to receive any direction which
the current of fashion may chance to give you, what
can you expect to follow from such beginnings?
While so many around you are undergoing the sad
consequences of a like indiscretion, for what reason
shall not those consequences extend to you ? Shall
you attain success without that preparation, and escapa
dangers without that precaution, which is required of.
others? Shall happiness grow up to you, of its own
accord, and solicit your acceptance, when, to the rest
of mankind, it is the fruit of long cultivation, and theI
acquisition of labour and care ?-Deceive not your-
selves with such arrogant hopes. Whatever be yoiur
rank, Providence will not, for your sake, reverse its (
established order. The author of your being hath ci-(
joined you to take heed to your ways ; to ponder the paths
of your feet; to remember your Creator in the days ofymour
youth. He hath decreed, that they only who seek a/sir
wisdom shal find it ; that fools shall be afflicted because
of their transgressions ; and that whoso refuseth instruc-

tlon shall destroy his own soul. By listening to these
admonitions, and tempering the vivacity of youth with
a proper mixture of serious thought, you may ensure
cheerfulness for the rest of lIfc; but by delivering
yourselves up at present to giddiness and 'levity, you
lay the foundation of lasting heaviness of heart.
When you look forward to those plans of life, which
either your circumstances have suggested, or your
friends have proposed, you will not hesitate to ac-
knowledge that, in order to pursue them with advan-
tage, some previous discipline is requisite. Be assured,
that whatever is to be your profession, no education is
more necessary tO your success, than the acquirement
of virtuous dispositions and habits. This is the uni-
versal preparation for every character, and every station
in life. Bad as the world is, respect is always paid to
virtue. In the usual course of human affairs, it-will be
lound, that a plain understanding joined with acknow-
ledged worth, contributes more to prosperity, than the
brightest parts without probity or honour. Whether
icience, or business, or public life be your aim, virtue
,till enters for a principal share, into all those great de-
artments of society. It is connected with eminence in
very liberal art; with reputation, in every branch of fair
:nd useful business; with distinction, in every public
tation. The vigour which it gives the mind, and the
meight which it adds to character; the generous senti-
vents which it breathes, the undaunted spirit which it
tspires, the ardour of diligence which it quickens,
ie freedom which it procures from pernicious and
ishonourable avocations, are the foundations of all
lit is high in fame, or great in success among men.
'hatever ornamental or engaging endowments you

^ 3

now possess, virtue is a necessary requisite, in order t
their shining with proper lustre. Feeble are the at
tractions of the fairest form, if it be suspected tha
nothing within corresponds to the pleasing appearanc
without. Short are the triumphs of wit, when it i
supposed to be the vehicle of malice. By whateve
arts you may at first attract the attention, you can hol
the esteem, and secure the hearts of others, only b
amiable dispositions, and the accomplishments of th
mind. These are the qualities whose influence xwil
last, when the lustre of all that once sparkled and
dazzled has passed away. Let not then thi
season of youth be barren of improvements so essentia
to your future felicity and honour. Now is the seed
time of life; and according to what you sow, you sl/a
reap. Your character is now, under Divine assistal:ce
of your own forming; your fate is, in some measure,
put into your own hands. Your nature is, as yet, plian
and soft. Habits have not established their dominion
Prejudices have not pre-occupied your understanding.
The world has not had time to contract and debasds
your affections. All your powers are more vigorousl,
disembarrassed, and free, than they will be at ar.vy
ture period. Whatever impulse you now give to youI
desires and passions, the direction is likely to con
tinue. It will form the channel in which your lile i
to run; nay, it may determine its everlasting isLsu.
Consider then the employment of this inipu!talt pe
riod as the highest trust which shall ever be conmilttcd.
to you; as, in a great measure, decisive of your happi.
ness, in time, and in eternity. As in the succession <
the seasons, each, by the invariable laws of nature, as
sects the productions of what is next in course; so, in|

human life, every period of our age, according as it is
well or ill spent, influences the happiness of that which
is to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings for-
ward accomplished and flourishing manhood; and
such manhood passes of itself, without uneasiness, into
respectable and tranquil old age. But when nature is
turned out of its regular course, disorder takes place in
the moral, just as in the vegetable world. If the spring
put forth no blossoms, in summer there will be no
beauty, and in autumn no fruit. So, if youth be trifled
away without improvement, manhood will be con-
lemnptible, and old age miserable. If the beginnings
of life have been vanity, its latter end can be no other
than vexation of spirit.

Piety to God is the foundation of good morals, and

is a disposition particularly graceful and becoming in
youth. To be void of it, argues a cold heart destitute
of some of the best affections which belong to that age.
Youth is the season of warm and generous emotions.
The heart should then, spontarieously, rise into the ad-
miration of what is great, glow with the love of what
is fair and excellent, and melt at the discovery of ten-
derness and goodness. Where can any object be
found, so proper to kindle those affections, as the Fa-
ther of the universe, and the Author of all felicity ?
Unmoved by veneration, can you contemplate that
grandeur and majesty, which his works every where
display ? Untouched by gratitude, can you view that-
profusion of good, which, in this pleasing season of
life his beneficent hand pours around you ? Happy in
the love and affection of those with whom you are con-
nected, look up to the Supreme Being, as the inspirer
of all the friendship which has ever been shewn you

A4

by others; himself, your best and your first friend ;
formerly, the supporter of your infancy, and the guide
of your childhood; now, the guardian of your youth, |
and the hope of your coming years. View religious
homage, as a natural expression of gratitude to him
for all his goodness. Connected with so many tender
sensibilities of soul, let religion be with you, not the
cold and barren offspring of speculation, but the warm
and vigorous dictate of the heart. But though
piety cheifly belongs to the heart, yet the aid of the
understanding is requisite, to give a .proper direction
to the devout affections. You must endeavour there-
fore to acquire just views, both of the great principles
of natural religion, and of the peculiar doctrines of
the gospel. For this end study the sacred scriptures.
Consult the word of God, more than the systems of
men, if you would know the truth in its native purity.
When, upon rational and sober inquiry, you have
established your principles, suffer them not to be
shaken by the scoffs of the licentious, or the cavils of
the sceptical. Remember, that in the examination of
every great and comprehensive plan, such as that of
Christianity, difficulties may be expected to occur;
and that reasonable evidence is not to be rejected be-
cause the nature of our present state allows us only to
klnow in part, and to see through a glass darkly. Im-
press your minds with reverence for all that is sacred.
Let no wantonness of youthly spirits, no compliance
with the intemperate mirth of others, ever'betray you
into pl ophane sallies. Besides the guilt which is there.
by incurred, nothing gives a more odious appearance
of petulance and presumption to youth, than the affec-

tation of treating religion with levity. Instead of be-
ing an evidence of superior understanding, it discovers
a pert and shallow mind; which, vain of the first smat-
terings of knowledge, presumes to make light of what
the rest of mankind revere. At the same time
you are not to imagine, that when exhorted to be re-
ligious you are called upon to become more formal
and solemn in your manners than others of the same
years, or to erect yourselves into supercilious reprov-
ers of those around you. The spirit of true religion
breathes gentleness and affability. It gives a native,
unaffected ease to the behaviour. It is social, kind,
and cheerful; far removed from that gloomy and il-
liberal superstition which clouds the brow, sharpens
the temper, dejects the spirits, and teaches men to fit
themselves for another world, by neglecting the con-
cerns of this. Let your religion, on the contrary, con-
nect preparation for heaven, with an honourable dis-
charge of the duties of active life. Let it be associated
in your imagination, with all that is manly and useful;
with whatsoever things are true, are just, are pure, are
lovely, are of good report, wherever there is any virtue,
and wherever there is any praise. Of such religion
discover, on every proper occasion, that you are not
ashamed; but avoid making any unnecessary ostenta-
tion of it before the world.

To piety join modesty and docility, reverence of

your parents, and submission to those who are your
superiors in knowledge, in station, and in years. De-
pendence and obedience belong to youth. Modesty
is one of its chief ornaments; and has ever been es-
teemed a presage of rising merit. When entering on
the career of life, it is your part, not to assume the

reigns as yet into your hands; but to commit yourselves
to the guidance of the more experienced, and to be.
come wise by the wisdom of those who have gone be-
fore you. Of all the follies incident to youth,
there are none which either deform its present appear-
ance, or blast the prospect of its future prosperity, moel
than self-conceit, presumption, and obstinacy. B
checking its natural progress in improvement, they si|
"it in long immaturity; and frequently produce mis-
chiefs, which can never be repaired. Yet these are vices
too commonly found among the young. Big with en-
terprise, and elated by hope, they resolve to trust for
success to none but themselves. Full of their own
abilities, they deride the admonitions which are given
them by their friends, as the timorous suggestions of
age. Too wise to learn, too impatient to deliberate,
too forward to be restrained, they plunge, with preci-i
pitant indiscretion, into the midst of all the dangers
with which life abounds. Seest thou a youngman zuise in
his own conceit? There is more hope of a fool than of hintm.
-Positive as you now are in your opinions, and con-
sident in your assertions, be assured, that the time ap-j
proaches when both men and things will appear to youi
in a different light. Many characters which you now'
admire, will, by and by, sink in your esteem; andi
many opinions, of which you are at present most tena-
cious, -will alter as you advance in years. Distrust,
therefore, that glare of youthful presumption, which
dazzles your eyes. Abound not in your bwn sense.
Put not yourselves forward with too much eagerness;i
nor imagine, that by the impetuosity of juvenile ar-|
dour, you can overturn systems which have been long!
established, and change the face of the world. Lear:

not to thinrk more highly of yourselves than you ought, but
to think soberly. By patient and gradual progression in
improvement, you may, in due time, command lasting
esteem. But by' assuming, at present, a tone of supe-
riority, to which you have no title, you will dirgust
those whose approbation it is most important to gain.
Forward vivacity may fit you to be the companions of
an idle hour. More solid qualities must recommend
you to the wise, and mark you out for importance
and consideration in subsequent life.

It is necessary to recommend to you, sincerity and

truth. This is the basis of every virtue. That dark-
ness of character where we can see no heart; those
foldings of art, through which no native affection is
allowed to penetrate, present an object, unamiable in
every season of life, but particularly odious in youth.
If, at an age when the heart is warm, when the emo-
tions are strong, and when nature is expected to
shew itself free and open, you can already smile and
deceive, what are we to look for when you shall be
longer hackneyed in the ways of men; when interest
shall have completed the obduration of your heart, and
experience shall have improved you in all the arts of
guile ? Dissimulation in youth, is the fore-runner of
perfidy in old age. Its first appearance is the fatal
omen of growing depravity, and future shame. It de-
grades parts and learning; obscures thc.lustre of every
accomplishment; and sinks you into contempt with
God and man. As you value, therefore, the ap-
probation of heaven, or the esteem of the world, cul-
tivate the love of truth. In all your proceedings be di-
rect and consistent. Ingenuity and candour possess
the most powerful charm; they bespeak universal fa.

your, and carry an apology for almost every failing.
The lip of truth shall be established for ever; but a lying
tongue is but for a moment The path of truth, is a
plain and a safe path ; that of falsehood, is a perplexing
maze. After the first departure from sincerity, it is not
in your power to stop. One artifice unavoidably leads
on to another; till, as the intricacy of the labyrinth
increases, you are left entangled in your own snare.
Deceit discovers a little mind, which stops at tempo-
rary expedients, without rising to comprehensive views
of conduct. It betrays, at the same time, a dastardly
spirit. It is the resource of one who wants courage to
avow his design's, or to rest upon himself. Whereas,
openness of character displays that generous boldness
which ought to distinguish youth. To set out in the
world with no other principle than a crafty attention
to interest, betokens one who is destined for creeping
through the inferior walks of life. But to give an early
preference to ho:nour above gain, when they stand in
competition; to despise every advantage, which can-
not be attained without dishonest arts; to brook no
meanness, and to stoop to no dissimulation; are the
indications of a great mind, the presages of future em-
inence and distinction in life. At the same time,
this virtuous sincerity is perfectly consistent with the
most prudent vigilance and caution. It is opposed to
cunning, not to true wisdom. It is not the simplicity
of a weak and improvident, but the candour of an
enlarged and noble mind; of one who scorns deceit,
because he accounts it both base and unprofitable;
and who seeks no disguise, because he needs none to
hide him.

S Youth is the proper season of cultivating the b--

nevolent and humane affections. As a great part of
your happiness is to depend on the connections which
you form with others, it is of high importance that
you acquire, betimes, the temper and the manners
which will render such connections comfortable. Let
a sense of justice be the foundation of all your social
qualities. In, your most early intercourse with the
world, and even in your youthful amusements, let no
unfairness be found. Engrave on your mind that sa-
cred rule, of doing all things to others according as you
wish that they should do unto you. For this end, impress
yourselves with a deep sense of the original and nat-
ural equality of men.

- Whatever advantages of birth

or fortune you possess, never display them with an os-
tentatious superiority. Leave the subordinations of
tank, to regulate the intercourse of more advanced
years. At present, it becomes you to act among your
companions, as man with man. Remember how un-
known to you are the vicissitudes of the world; and
how often they, on whom ignorant and contemptuous
young men once looked down with scorn, have risen
to be their superiors in future years. Compassion
is an emotion of which you ought never to be asham-
ed. Graceful in youth is the tear of sympathy and
the heart that melts at the tale of woe. Let not ease
and indulgence contract your affections, and wrap
you up in selfish enjoyments. But g, sometimes to the
house of mourning, as well as to the house of feasting.
Accustom yourselves to think of the distrLsses of hu-
man life; of the solitary cottage, the 1jiing parrrnL,
and the weeping orphan. Never sport with pain and
distress, in any of your amusements ; nor treat evCtu
the meanest insect with wanton cruelty. In

young minds there is commonly a strong propensity
to particular intimacies and friendships. Youth in-
deed, is the season when friendships are sometimes
formed, which not only continue through succeeding
life, but which glow to the last, with a tenderness
unknown to the connections begun in cooler years.
The propensity therefore is not to be discouraged;
though at the same time it must be regulated with
much circumspection and care. Too many of the
pretended friendships of youth, are mere combina-
tions in pleasure. They are often founded on capri-
cious likings; suddenly contracted, and as suddenly
dissolved. Sometimes they are the effect of interested
complaisance and flattery on the one side, and of cred-
ulous fondness on the other. Beware of such rash and
dangerous connections, which may afterwards load
you with dishonour. Remember that by the charac-
ter of those whom you choose for your friends, your
own is likely to be formed, and will certainly be judg-
ed of by the world. Be slow, therefore, and cautious
in contracting intimacy; but when a virtuous friend-
ship is once established, consider it as a sacred engage-
ment. Expose not yourselves to the reproach of light-
ness and inconstancy, which always bespeak, eitho
a trifling, or a base mind. Reveal none of the secrce
of your friend. Be faithful to his interests. Forsakc
him not in danger. Abhor the thought of acquiring
any advantage by his prejudice or hurt. Ir
order to render yourselves amiable in society, cop
rect every appearance of harshness in behaviour.
Let that courtesy distinguish your demeanor, whici
springs, not so much from, studied politeness, as fron
a mild and gentle heart. Follow the customs of th

world in matters indifferent; but stop when they be-
come sinful. Let your manners be simple and natural;
and of course they will be engaging. Affectation is
certain deformity. By forming themselves on fantastic
models, and vying with one another in every reigning
folly, the young begin with being ridiculous, and end
in being vicious and immoral.

The love of pleasure, natural to man in every

period of his life, glows at this age with excessive
ardour. Novelty adds fresh charms, as yet, to every
gratification. The world appears to spread a contin-
ual feast; and health, vigour, and high spirits, invite
them to partake of it without restraint. In vain we
warn them of latent dangers. Religion is accused of
insufferable severity, in prohibiting enjoyment, and
the old, when they offer their admonitions, are up-
braided with having forgot that they once were young.
-And yet, my friends, to what do the restraints of
religion, and the counsels of age, with respect to plea-
sure, amount? They may all be comprized in few
words, not to hurt yourselves, and not to hurt others,
by your pursuit of pleasure. Within these bounds
pleasure is lawful, beyond them, it becomes criminal,
because it is ruinous. Are these restraints any other
than what a wise man would choose to impose on
himself? We call you not to renounce pleasure, but
to enjoy it in safety. Instead of abridging it, we ex-
hort you to pursue it on an extensive plan. We pro-
pose measures for securing its possession, and for pro-
longing its duration. Consult your whole nature.
Consider yourselves not only as sensitive, but as
rational beings; not only as rational, but social;
sot only as social, but immortal. Whatever violates

your nature in any of these respects, cannot afford
true pleasure; any more than that which undermines
an essential part of the vital system can promote
health. For the truth of this conclusion, we ap-
peal not merely to the authority of religion, nor
to the testimony of the aged, but to yourselves and
your own experience. We ask, Whether you have not;
found, that in a course of criminal excess, your plea-
sure was more than compensated by succeeding painj
Whether, if not from every particular instance, yet
from every habit, at leasr, of unlawful gratification, i
there did not spring some thorn to wound you, there
did not arise some consequence to make you repent of
it in the issue ? If you have any consideration 6r any
firmness left, avoid temptations, for which you have
found yourselves unequal, with as much care, as you
would shun pestilential infection. Break off all con-
nections with the loose and profligate. When sinners
entice thee, consent thou not. Look not on the wine when it
:.s red, when it giveth its colour in the cup; for at the last,
it bitcth like a serpent, and stingeth-like an adder. Re-
move thy way from the strange woman, and come not 1:car
the door of her house. Let not thine heart decline to her
ways; for her house is the way to hell. Thou goest sfter
her as a bird hastcth to the snare; and knoweth not that it
is Jor his life. By these unhappy excesses of ir-
regular pleasure in youth, how many amiable dispo-
sitions are corrupted or destroyed ! How many risinj
capacities and powers are suppressed I How many
flattering hopes of parents and friends are totally ex-
tinguished I Who but must drop a tear over human
nature, when he beholds that morning which arose so
bright, overcast with such untimely darkness; tht:

good humour which once captivated all hearts, that
vivacity which sparkled in every company, those abil-
ities which were fitted for adorning the highest sta-
tion, all sacrificed at the shrine of low sensuality; and
one who was formed for running the fair career of
life in the midst of public esteem, cut off by his vices
at the beginning of his course, or sunk for the whole
of it, into insignificancy and contempt!--These, O
sinful Pleasure! are thy trophies. It is thus that, co-
operating with the foe of God and man, thou de-
gradest human.honour and blastest the opening pros
pects of human felicity.

Diligence, industry, and proper improvement of

time are material duties of the young. To-no purpose
are they endowed with the best abilities, if they want
activity for exerting them. Unavailing, in this case,
will be every direction that can be given them, either
for their temporal or spiritual welfare. In youth
the habits of industry are most easily acquired. In
youth, the incentives to it are strongest, from ambi-
tion and from duty, from emulation and hope, from
all the prospects which.the beginning of life affords.
If, dead to these calls, you already languish in sloth-
ful inaction, what will be able to quicken the more
sluggish current of advancing years ? Industry
is not only the instrument of improvement, but the
foundation of pleasure. Nothing is so opposite so
the true enjoyment of life, as the relaxed and feeble
state of an indolent mind. He who is a stranger to
industry, may possess, but he cannot enjoy. For it
is labour only which gives the relish to pleasure. It
is the appointed vehicle of every good to man. It is
the indispensable condition of our possessi aQ squnad

N

mind ini a sound body.. Sloth is so inconsistent with
both, that it is hard to determine whether it be a
greater foe to virtue, or to health and happiness. In-.
active as it is in itself, its effects are fatally power-
ful. Though it appear a slowly flowing stream, yet it
undermines all that is stable and flourishing. It not
only saps the foundation of every virtue, but pours
upon you a deluge of crimes and evils. It is like wa-
ter which first petrifies by stagnation, and then sends
up noxious vapours, and fills the atmosphere with
death. Fly, therefore, from idleness, as the
certain parent both of guilt and of ruin. And under
idleness I include, not mere inaction only, but all that
circle of trifling occupations, in which too many
saunter away their youth; perpetually engaged in
frivolous society, or public amusements; in the la.
bours of dress, or the ostentation of their persons.-
Is this the foundation which you lay for future useful.
ness and esteem ? By such accomplishments, do you
hope to recommend yourselves to the thinking paut
of the world, and to answer the expectations of your
friends and your country ?-Amusements, youth re-
quires. It were vain, it were cruel to prohibit them.
But though allowable as the relaxation, they are most
culpable as the business of the young. For they then
become the gulph of time, and the poison of the mind.
They foment bad passions. They weaken the man-
ly powers. They sink the native vigour of youth, in-
td contemptible effeminacy. Redeeming your
time from such dangerous waste, seek to fill it with
employments which you may review with satisfac-
tion. The acquisition of knowledge is one of the
most honourable occupations of youth. The desire

of it discovers a liberal mind, and is connected with
many accomplishments, and many virtues. But tho*
your train of life should not lead you to study, the
course of education always furnishes proper employ-
ments to a well-disposed mind. Whatever you pursue
be emulous to excel. Generous ambition, and sensi-
bility to praise, are, especially at your age, among the
marks of virtue. Think not, that any affluence of for-
tune, or any elevation of rank, .exempts you from the
duties of application and industry. Industry is the
law of our being; it is the demand of nature, of reason,
and of God. Remember always, that the years which
now pass over your heads, Icave permanent memorials
behind them. From your thoughless minds they may
escape; but they remain in the remembrance of God.
They form an important part of the register of your
life. They will hereafter bear testimony, either for or
against you, at that day when for all your actions, but
particularly for the employments of youth, you must
give an account to God. Thus I have set be-
fore you some of the chief qualifications which belong
to a virtuous and religious character; piety, modes-
ty, tr-uth, benevolence, temperance, and industry.
Whether your future course is destined to be long or
short, after this manner it should commence; and, if it
continue to be thus conducted, its conclusion, at what
time soever it arrives, will not be inglorious or un.
happy.

Let your attention be recalled to that dependence

on the blessing of heaven, which, amidst all your
endeavours after improvement, you ought continu-
ally to preserve. It is too common with the young,
even when they resolve to tread the path of virtue and

honour, to set out with presumptuous confidence in
themselves. Trusting to their own abilities for carry-
ing them successfully through life, they are careless of
applying to God, or of deriving any assistance from
what they are apt to reckon the gloomy discipline of
religion. Alas! how little do they know the dangers[
which await them ? Neither human wisdom, nor hu-
man virtue, unsupported by religion, are equal to the
trying situations which often occur in life. By the
shock of temptation, how frequently have the mostj
virtuous intentions been overthrown? Under the pres-
sure of disaster, how often has the greatest constancy
sunk? Every good and every perfect gift, is from above.
Wisdom and virtue, as well as riches and honour, come
from God. Destitute of his favour, you are in no better
situation, with all your boasted abilities, than orphans
left to wander in a trackless desert, without any guide
to conduct them, or any shelter to cover them from thel
gathering storm. Correct then this ill-founded arro-
gance. Expect not, that your happiness can be inde-d
pendent of him who made you. By faith and repent-
ance apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety
and prayer, seek the protection of the God of heaven.
In fine, remember the solemn words, in which a great
Prince delivered his dying charge to his son; words
which every young person ought to consider as ad-
dressed to himself, and to engrave deeply on his heart:
Thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy fathers;
and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing
mind. For the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understand-
ethall the imaginations of tte thoughts. If thou seek him,
he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will
cast thee of for ever.

ON THE DUTIES OF SCHOOL BOYS.

FROM RfOLLIN.

Quinctilian says, that he has included almost all the
duty of scholars in this one piece of advice which he
gives them, to love those who teach them, as they
love the sciences which they learn of them; and to
look upon them as fathers, from whom they derive
not the life of the body, but that instruction which
is in a manner the life of the soul. Indeed this sen-
timent of affection and respect suffices to make them
apt to learn during the time of their studies, and full
of gratitude all the rest of their lives. It seems to me
to include a great part of what is to be expected from
them. Docility, which consists in submitting
to directions, in readily receiving the instructions of
their masters, and reducing them to practice, is proper-
ly the virtue of scholars, as that of masters is to teach
well. The one can do nothing without the other; and
as it is not sufficient for a labourer to sow the seed,
unless the earth, after having opened its bosom to re-
ceive it, in a manner hatches, warms, and moistens it;
so likewise the whole fruit of instruction depends up.
on a good correspondence between the masters and
the scholars. Gratitude for those who have la.
boured in our education, is the character of an honest
man, and the mark of a good heart. Who is there
among us, says Cicero, that has been instructed with
any care, that is not highly delighted with the sight, or
even the bare remembrance of his preceptors, masters,
ad the place where he was taught and brought up ?

Seneca exhorts young men to preserve always a great
respect for their masters, to whose care they are in-
debted for the amendment of their faults, and for
having imbibed sentiments of honour and probity.
Their exactness and severity displease sometimes at an
age when we are not in a condition to judge of the
obligations we owe to them; but when years have
ripened our understanding and judgment, we then
discern that what made us dislike them, I mean ad-
monitions, reprimands, and a severe exactness in re.
straining the passions of an imprudent and inconsid-
erate age, is expressly the very thing which should
make us esteem and love them. Thus we see that
Marcus Aurelius, one of the wisest and most illustri-
ous emperors that Rome ever had, thanked the gods
for two things especially-for his having had excel-
lent tutors himself, and that he had found the like for
his children. Quinctilian, after ha ving noted
the different characters of the mind in chC:dren,
draws, in a few words, the image of what he judgci
to be a perfect scholar; and certainly it is a very am-
iable one: " For my part," says he, " I like a child
who is encouraged by commendation, is animated by
a sense of glory, and weeps when he is outdone. A
noble emulation will always keep him in exercise, a
reprimand will touch him to the quick, and honour
will serve instead of a spur. We need not fear that
such a scholar will ever give himself up to sullenness."
Mihi ille detur puer, quem laus excitet, quenm gloria
juvet, qui virtus fleat. Hic erit alendus ambitu: hunc
mordebit objurgatio: hunc honor excitabie: in hoc
desidiam nunquam verebor. How great a
value soever Quinctilian sets upon the talents of the

mind, he esteems those of the heart far beyond them,
and looks upon the others as of no value without them.
In the same chapter from whence I took the preced-
ing words, he declares, he should never have a good.
opinion of a child, who placed his study in occasion-
ing laughter, by mimicking the behaviour, mien, and
faults of others; and he presently gives an admirable
reason for it: " A child," says he, " cannot be truly
ingenious, in my opinion, unless he be good and vir-
tuous; otherwise, I should rather choose to have him
dull and heavy than of a bad disposition." Non
dabit spem bonae indolis, qui hoc imitandi studio pet-
it, ut rideatur. Nam probus quoque imprimis erit
ille vere ingeniosus: alioqui non pejus duxerim tardi
esse ingenii, quam mall. He displays to us all
these talents in the eldest of his two children: whose
character he draws, and whose death he laments in so
eloquent and pathetic a strain, in the beautiful pre-
face to his sixth book. I shall beg leave to insert
here a small extract of it, which will not be useless to
the boys, as they will find it a model which suits well
with their age and condition. After having
mentioned his younger son, who died at five years old,
and described the graces and beauties of his counte-
,ance, the prettiness of his expressions, the vivacity of
his understanding, which began to shine through the
veil of childhood: " I had still left me," says he,
" my son Quinctilian, in whom I placed all my plea.
sure and all my hopes, and comfort enough I might
have found in him: for having now entered into his
tenth year, he did not produce only blossoms like his
younger brother, but fruits already formed, and be-
yond the power of disappoidtment.-I have much ex-

perience; but I never saw in any child, I do not say
only so many excellent dispositions for the sciences,
nor so much taste, as his masters know, but so much
probity, sweetness, good-nature, gentleness, and in-
clination to please, and oblige, as I discerned in him.

" Besides this, he had all the advantages of nature,

a charming voice, a pleasing countenance, and a sur-
prising facility in pronouncing well the two languages,
as if he had been equally born for both of them.
*' But all this was no more than hopes. I set a
greater value upon his admirable virtues, his equality
of temper, his resolution, the courage with which he
bore up against fear and pain; for, how were his phy-
sicians astonished at his patience under a distemper
of eight months continuance, when at the point of
death he comforted me himself, and bade me not to
weep for him! and delirious as he sometimes was at
his last moments, his tongue ran of nothing else but
learning and the sciences: 0 vain and deceitful
hopes!" &c. Are there many boys amongst
us, of whom we can truly say so much to their ad-
vantage, as Quinctilian says here of his son ? Whata
shame would it be for them, if, born and brought up
in a Christian country, they had not even the virtues
of Pagan children! I make no scruple to repeat them
here again-docility, obedience, respect for their mas-
ters, or rather a degree of affection, and the source of
an eternal gratitude; zeal for study, and a wonderful
thirst after the sciences, joined to an abhorrence of
vice and irregularity; an admirable fund of probity,
goodness, gentleness, civility, and liberality; as also
patience, courage, and greatness of soul in the course
of a long sickness. What then was wanting to all

these virtues ?-That, which alone could render them
truly worthy the name, and must be in a manner the
soul of them, and constitute their whole value, the
precious gift of faith and piety; the saving knowledge
of a Mediator; a sincere desire of pleasing God, arid
referring all our actions to him.

# THE HONOUR AND ADVANTAGE OF A CONSTANT ADHERENCE TO TRUTH.

THE HONOUR AND ADVANTAGE OF A
CONSTANT ADHERENCE TO TRUTH.

Petrarch, a celebrated Italian Poet, who flourished

about four hundred years ago, recommended himself
to the confidence and affection of Cardinal Colonna,
in whose family he resided, by his candour and
strict regard to truth. A violent quarrel occurred in
the household of this nobleman, which was carried so
far, that recourse was had to arms. The Cardinal
wished to know the foundation of this affair; and
that he might be able to decide with justice, he as-
sembled all his people, and obliged them to bind
themselves, by a most solemn oath on the Gospels, to
declare the whole truth. Every one, without excep-
tion, submitted to this determination; even the Bishop
of Luna, brother to the Cardinal, was not excused.
Petrarch, in his turn, presenting himself to take the
oath, the Cardinal closed the book, and said, " As to
you, Petrarch, your word is sujfcient."* A story
similar to this is related of Zenocrates, an Athenian
Philosopher, who lived three hundred years before
Christ, and was educated in the school of Plato.
The people of Athens entertained so high an opinion
of his probity, that one day when he approached the
altar, to confirm by an oath the truth of what he had
asserted, the judges unanimously declared his word to
be sufficient evidence.

IDLENESS AND IRRESOLUTION.

Horace, a celebrated Roman poet, relates, that a

country-man, who wanted to pass a river, stood loit-
ering on the banks of it, in the foolish expectation
that a current so rapid, would soon discharge its wa-
ters. But the streamn still flowed; increased, perhaps,
by fresh torrents from the mountains; and it must for
ever flow, because the sources from which it is deriv-
ed are inexhaustible. Thus the idLy and irres-
olutt yout/h trifles over his books, or wastes in play his
precious moments; deferring the task of improve-
ment, which at first is easy to be accomplished, but
which will become more and more difficult the longer
it is neglected.

AFFECTION TO PARENTSI

An amiable youth was lamenting, in terms of the

sincerest grief, the death of a most affectionate parent.
His coimpanion endeavoured to console him by the re-
flection, that he had always behaved to the deceased
with duty, tenderness, and respect. So I thought, re-
plied the youth, whilst my parent was living: but
now I recollect, with pain and sorrow, many instan-
ces of disobedience and neglect, for which, alas! it is
too late to make atonement.
