harsh- and ill-founded conitruction of
the intention of P~rovidence in his dif-
a~ters, they only added to his focrrows
Iby unjuit upbraiding. Hence thos~e
many pathetic lamen~tationrs with which
this book abounds, poured forth in the
n1rrot beautiful and touching firain of
Oriental poetry. In one of those hours
of lamentation, the sentiment in the
text was uttered; My foucl is ·reeary of
mry hfe ; a f'entiment, which falrely, if
any situation can j'ufify it, .it w·ias al-
10wable in the cafe of Job,

IN 'iituations very different from that

of J~ob, under calamities far Ilefs~ severe,
it is not uncommon to find furch a fen-
timent working in the heart, and fame-
tirres breaking forth from the lips of
men. Many, very many there are, who

circumffances this feeling may be
deemed excufeable s in what it is to be
held sinful; and under what reftrisions

text in three lights; as expressing,
Sirs,) The fientiment of a dis~content-
ed man; Secondly, The sentiment of
an afflidted man-; 'Ibirdlyj, The f~entil
ment of a devout man.

J. LE'r us confider the text as ex-

preiling the s~entiment of a discontent-
ed man; with whom it is the effufion
of spleen, vexation and diffatisf~adion
with life, ariiing from causes neither
laudablek nor juffifiable. There are
chiefly three clairFes of men who are

terminates in weariness and vexation of

he can of thos~e comforts which Provi-
dence has still left in his posses lion.

Acow 3 it sometimes happens that,

apart from grief, great revers~es of world-
ly fortune give rifie to the lamentation
in the text. This was the cafe with Job
himself. A sudden fall from opulence
into indignce and want; S fme undefer-
ved disgrace incurred, or some unexpeat-
ed cloud thrown over former reputation
andl fame; the unkindnlefs .and desertion
of fiiends, or the idiolent triumph of e-
nemies, are apt to overwhelm the minds
of men with giloom,~and to reduce them

to be weary of life~.. To persons ti~ider atRM;
such calamities, fyrmpathy is due. TIhat ,;
itympithy, howeveti, will be proportion-
ed to the degree in which wce confider
therfi as free froim b;ame~ ini the misfor-
tunes which they f~uff~er. 'As far as,
th~rough their own mifconduAt and vice,
they have been the authors to thems~elves
of those misfortunes, we withdraw our
pity. TFhe burthen which they have
ibrought on thems~elves we leave them
to bear as they can?; and with little con-
cern wek hear them exclaiin that their-
fouls are we~ary o~fflf.--Not only so, but
even in cafes where calamities have fallen
on the: innocent, to the pity which we
feel for thern· will be joined a s~ecret con-
tempt, if we perceive that together with
their prof'perity, their courage and fCor-
titude have also forfakeri them. To
abandon themselves to deje~tion carries
no mark of a great or a worthy mind.

the ifentiment in the text may fometunes

tion, how sincere however, is not alto--~
gether of a rational and chastened kind.
It was from this temper that, in former
ages of the church, the numerous race
sprung of anchorets, hermits, and all the
various orders who voluntarily abandon-
ed the world, to people the lonely def~arts
and th.e yxonaftic retreat. The ordinary
cours~e of things seemed below them as
candidates fpr heaven.. TIhe con~cerns~of
the world .appeared unworthy of their
attention, and dangerous to their virtue,
Breathing after a higher slate, they ima-

amusement, as long as they were ~forced
to remain in this place of exile.

S E R M, Let us bewatre of all. such imaginary

1.refinements as produce a' total disrelish

of our present condition. Th~eyare, for
th~e most part, grafted either on difap--
pointed pursuit~s, or orn a: melancholy and
s~plenetic: cast of minrd. They are far
from contributing to happi~neis, and are
inconfi~flet wa~ith all the aaiv~e virtues of~
man, This ~ife~ deserves not indeed to
be pu~t in competition with that blefedd
immortality to which' God has rais~ed our
hopes. But fachi as it is, it is· the g~ift
of God., It is the sphere in which his
wrifdomj has placed us,. and appointed its·
to atoutrparts, A~s ong as it lais, we
mnuft neith~eF flightr the duties which i~t
requir~es,. nor undervalue the innocent
enjoyments which it ofFers.· It belongs
to a man to live amonrg men as· his bre~
t~hren ; which he~ who declares hiefelf
wveary of life is not qlualified to dlo withi~
proprietyS

TaU~s I have pslaced before you, in

sarious· views, ;the sentiment in the text s

and.

and have' thewn in what circumffances, S ER M .
and from what causes, that disrelish of. '
life arises which is ·often found among
mankind. Oni a review of the whole,
we cannot but acknowledge, that it is
oftener to be areribed to our owun vices
and follies, than to any other caus~e,
Among the multitudes in the world, to
whom at this day life is burdensome, the
far greater number is of those who hav~e
rendered it to to themselves. Their idle-
ner~s, their luxury 'and pleasures, their
criminal deeds, their immoderat'e pas-
Iions, their timidity and bjafeneisof mind,
have dejeffed them in such a degree, as
to make them wearY of their exiffence.
Preyed upon by discontent of their own ·
creating, they complain of life when
they ought to reprehend thems~elves.

Various affliations there doubtlets are

in the world i many persons with whom
we have cause to fyrmpathiife, and whom
we might reasonably fo~rgive for withr
ing death toclo~e. their sorrows. But of
the evils which embitter life,.it must be

B 2 . admitted,

SETiR M. admitted, that the greater part is ficih as

..1_,we have b~rought on ourselves; or at leak

~such as, if w~e wiere niot `wbnring to our-
selves,- niight be' tolerably S(apported..
Whein wie compute the nunribers of those
whio are disposed to f~ay, M~yfould is w~eary
of my lye,' femet there are to whom this
fentimenrt is exculenable; but mlany more
among whom it is in no way judtifiable.
I admit that, sinoug the worthiest and
thie bes1, there may be dark moments
in which s~ome feeling~ of shis nature may
be apt to intrude upon their minds. But
wiith thein they are only mnoment-s of
occafionail arid passing gloom. Trhey
soon reca~ll he vigour of their minds;
and return with fa~tisfaetion to the dif-
charge of the duties, and to a palrticipa-
tion of the enjoyments, of life.

One g'reat cause of men's becoming

wveary of life is grounded on the milla-

SER M.T appears from thisL chapter , that one

L-3I design~ of the Apostle, in wr~itng tql

Timothy, wvas to guard him against cer-
tain corrupters of Christian doctrine,· who
had already arifena in th~echurch. To
their false representations 4f rliion he
opposes that general view of it which is
given in the text. Such summaries of

religion frequently occur in the s~acred s Ea M,
writings; and are ext~remely useful. By ,I~
the cormprehenfive energy with which
they expr~ess the great lines of our duty,
they both imprint them on our mremnory,
and bring thern home to our conscience
wvith for~ce. In the progress of his dif~
cours~e, I hope to make it appear, that
the words of the text ~afford a moi2 en-
larged and inflrudtive view of religioni
in alt~its chief parts.

The Apostle pronounces charity to be

the end or f'cope of the commandment~, that
is, of the law of G~od. . At the fame time,
in order to prevent: mif takeson this moif
important fubjea, he Subjoins to charity
certain adjundts, as necefa~ry to qualify
itl~, and to rendier the Chrrifian charadterr
complete. There are the pure hleart the
good con4/iene,, ald faith unfeigned. In
treating of th~ere I thall hew the nature~
of their connexion with charity, and the
importilner of theiri being always united

S E It II. TFAe end .of the Commandmest it c4 fits*

'I. Charity is the fame with benevloll~nce or

love s and is 'the term uniformly em-
ployed, in the New Teftiment, to denote
all the good affe~tions which Ave ought
to bear towards one another. It con~ifts
not in speculative ideas of general bene-
·ol~enc~e floating in the head, and leaving
the heart, .as Epeculations too often do,
untouched and cold. Neither is it con-
fined to that indolent good nature, which
makes it reft satisfied with bei~ng free
from inveterate mralice, or ill-will to our
fellow-creatures, without prompiting us
to be of fervlice to any. ~True ch3irity
is an aetive princriple - · t is not proper-
ly a single virtue s but a difpofitilon re-
diding in the heart, as a fountain whenice-
all the virt;·e~ssfbeni:giiity, cand~ourfo~r
besarance, generosity, coispafflori, arid li-
berality, flown, as fio m~iny nativ6~ fireams.
From general good v~ii1to all, it extends
its influence particlarly' t;6 those with-
whomn we .fland ~in neereft conne £ties,
and who are direttly within the (phere

of our good offices. From the country SE 14 M
or community to which we belong, it '-
def'cends to the fmnaller associations -of
neighbourhood, relations, and friends;
and [preads itself over the whole circle
of facial and domes tic li~fe. I mean not
~that it imports a promitcuous undifitn-
guilhing affeaion, whjich gives every
man an equal title to our love. Cha-
rity, if we thould endeavour to carry it
so far,' would be rendered an im~pradti-
cable virtue, and would retfolve itelf
into rnere words, withrout affeaing the
heart.~ True charity attemp~t~s not to thut
our eyes to thie diitintion~ betwetn good
and 'bad mrsen ; nor to warm our hearts
equally to thole-who befriend and those
whlO~injure us. It res~erves our este~em
for good men, and our complacency for
.our fr~iends. 'Towards ouir enemies it
in ~ires forgiveners and hurmanity. It
brea~th~es universal candour, and liberali-,

'of oentiment. It formns gentlene~s of

temper, and diC~tgts .af~fabilty of man-
Ilers. It prompts corresponding fym-pa-

S·ER M. thies with them who rejoice and them

~,who weep. It teaches us to flight and

der~pife no man. Charity is the comfort-.
er of the af~idted, the prote~tor of the
oppressed, the reconciler of differences,
the intercessor for offenders, It is faith-
fullness in the friend, public s~pirit in the
magiffrate, equity and patience in the
judge, moderation in the [overeign, and
loyalty in the fubjeat, In parents it is
care and: attention s in children It is re-
verence and fubmifiron. In a word, it
is the f~oul of soc~ial life, It is the fun
that enlivens and cheers the abodes of
mnen. It is likRe the dewe of 17ermon, says
the Pf~almif1, and the dewre that .de/cendeTtht
on the mounttarins of Zion, so·rete the Lord~
commaanded thte blefing, even lfe for ever,
mPor'e*.

SUCH charity, says the test, is the end

of thre conmmandmenat. This assertion of the

Aipolily

a PlaS. ckxxiii. 3t

kpoffle is undoubtedly consonant to all SER M.
that reason can fu~ggeit on the fnubjea of IL
rehigion. For, on confidiering the nature
of the Supreme Being, reason gives us
much ground to believe, that the chief
design of all the commandments whaich
he has given to men, is to promote their
happiness. Independent and felf-fuffici-
ent, that Supreme Being has nothing to
exat Ifrom us for his own interest or fe-
licity. By our services he cannot be
benefited, nor by our offences injured.
When he created the world, it was be-
nevolence that moved him to confer
exiffence. Whieix he miade hims~elf
known to his creatures, benevolence in
like manner moved him to give them
laws for their ondudt. Benevolence is
the spring oflegiflation ip the Deity, as
much as it was the motive of creation.
H~e issued his commands on earth on
purpos~e that by obedience to them, his
creatures might be rendered happy
am jng themselves in this life, and
be prepared for 'greater happineis·
in another. Charity, efpeciallywhen

joineg~

sErsR wr.oinded with purity, good conscienc~e, and

n.· ,faith, is obviously the great infirument,

for this purpose; an~d there~fore muffl
nreeds ysofefes the chief and primqary place
~in the laws of God.

Accordingly, ~through~out~ the _New

Teffa~ment, it: is u~niformly pref~eated to'
us in the ~a~me light in which it is placed
by the text. This is kpown to allwho
have any acquaintance ~with the sacred-
books. Charity is termed the fulfl/in of
the~ lai, and thEe bond of perfedEinefs. It
was afiumed by our blessed Lprd as the
charaderifftical diatnAion of h~i~s diict-
pl~es 3 and in that magnificent enlogium
which the Apostle Paul pronounces
upon it, in the thirteenth chapter ofthe
firit epistle to the Corinthians, it ~is ex-
prefiy preferred by ,him torf4 ~and
Aspe. ~This deserves tp ba~se ri5ully
consi;dered by -those who are :apt to
undervalue ,charity, as an appendage
of what they cotptempturoufly cg11 Mo-
rali~tyl while they confine true.. reli-
gion-to folne favourite tenets and Afier-
.vances of their own, which they confi-

der

der as comprehending the fum of what S ER Mn.
is aceptable to God. Such pefions how 1-Cf3
themselves profoundly ignorant of the
nature' of religion, and may too often be
fiutped~ed of being firangers to its influ-
ence. For, as the apof11e Joh~nreafons,
He that loveth not his brother, wh~lom hie
hath seen, ho~w can hte lov~e that God whrom
he Aath not seen~ ?

ATr the f~ame time, while I afecribe to

'charity that high place in the tyfitem of
teligion, which juilly belongs to it, I am
not to be underflood as confining all re-
ligion to this difpolition alone. With
much wi~dom~ and propriet-y, the text
hath· annexed ~to it certain: adjunds,
withoiut which neither he charader of a
good man can be completedl, nor charity
itifelf exercised to advantage. To the con-
fideration of therCe I now proceed ; and
·I enter the: more' readily on this branch

.of~

* I John Zv. so,

S ER M. of the fCubjeat, as there is ground to bee

"Llieve, that many pretend to possess cha-

rity, without properly underitanding its
nature and efficacy. There has been al-
ways an unhappy tendency among men
to run to extremes, on one fide or other,
in matters of religion. As one f~iet of
men, who employ all their zeal on right
belief, are prone to undervalue good
pradtice : so another set, who wis h to be
esteemed rational Christians, are inclined
to reft the whole of their duty on chari-
table deeds, while they overlook cer-
tain disp~ositions and habits which ought
always to accompany them. It is there-
fore of importance, that the mistakes of
both~ ther~e clafres of men ihould be redti-
fied, in order that religion may be held
forth to the world in its complete form,
and in its full and undiminished luitre.

·THE f irf 1 qualif ication of charity

pointed out in the text is purity; cha~rity
out ofa pure heart. Purity includes the
virtues which belong to the individual,

considered

coniidered in himf'elf, and with refpeR SEsR M.
to the government of his desires and U.
pleas~ures. It hath its feat in the heart;
but extends its influence over to much
of the outward condua, as to foi-m a
great and material part of the charaater.
They are only the pulre in hreart, we are
told by our Saviour, wh~/o can/ee God*~i.
It is also true, that they are only the pure
in heart who can properly dikcharge their
duties towards mankind. Inor-dinate love
of pleas~ure, intemperance, feat~uality,
and~ a. course of irregular life, are incon-
fiftent, not only with the general cha-
rader of a good man, but also with the
peculiar exercis~es of charity and bene-
volence. For nothing is~ more cer-
tain, than that habits of licentious in-
dulgence contribute to flifle all the
good affe~tions; to harden the heart;
to nourith that felfith attachment to
our own vitious pleas~ures which ren-
ders us int~enfible to the circumftan-

down, in the end, to be the burd~en and
nuisance of foiciety ? The profusion of
expence which their pleathres occasion,
accounts in a great meas~ure for the fatal
.revers~e that takes -plce in their charac-
ter. It nRot only drains 'the sources

.flow, but often ob~liges them to become
oppredivean lcruel to those whom it was

their

ported.

Purity of heart and condua~ muff

therefore be held fundamental to charity
and love, as well as to general piety and
virtue. The licentious, I know,.are rea-
dy to imagine, tha~t-their occasional deeds
of bounty and liberality wi~llatone for
many of their private disorders. But,
besides that such plans of compens~ation
for vices, by some suppos~ed virtues, are
always fallacious, the licentious may be.
assured, that it is an appearance only of
charity, not tlhe reality of it, to which
they can lay claim. For that great vir-
tue consists not in occajiional a~tions of
humanity, in fits of klindnef~s or compaf~-
sion, to which bad men may be prompted
by natural inflindt; but in the fleady and
regular exercis~e of those good affeations,
and the diifcharge of thos~e important du-
ties towards others, for which the licen- -
tious are in a great measure disqualified.
Their iriminal propen~sities diredt their
inclinations to very different objeats and

S ER M. purfilits; and often detennline them tO

nicious influence wh~ich the love of pleaL-
firre has on the good quait~ies of its de-
ivoted votaries-. The impure hear~t islikei
the flagnant arrd putrifying lake, which

THE ftCandi qualification annered to

Charity, ~inthe text, is, that it be of a
goodconflc~ience. By this I understand th
Apoffe to- meanr, tha~t charity be in full·
consistency· with juff~ice antd integrity a

peres to- perform aftions of benevotene,

loves mercy.·iReligion, my friends, in or- "
der to tender it useful, to mankind, must
b~e brought down by its teachers fromthe
fablimity of f'peculation to the fanAions
and occupations of ordinary life. It is
mny duty to admonish you, that you muff,
in the first place, bie fair in all your deal-
ings with others: you muif discharge the
debts you owe : you must pay the wages;
due to your servants and dependents;
you muff provide for your own family,
and be just to the claims of relations;
then, and then only, you canifr-om a good
cron/cience, as the text enjoins, perform
aats of generosity and mercy.

This leads to a refle~tion which her-e

des~erves~ our attention r that, in order to
fulfil that chlarity wh~Aich is thle end ofthe
commnandmenzt, aeconomy, and good order
in private life, ought to be carefully flu-
died by all Christians. ·This is more

apprehend is often not attended to 10 ZI.
much as it dese~rves. Among the frugal
and induff~rious, great regard is co-m-
monly paid to justice. They wIll not
defr~aud. They will not take any un-
lawful advantage in their dealings:
a~nd satisfied with this degree of good
conscience, they are firangers to that
charity, which is the end of thet .cm-
mandment. They are hard anid unfeel-
ing. They are rigid and severe in
their demands. They know nothing of
humanity, forgiveneis, or compafflon.-
Among another clas~s of men, who have
been more liberally educated, and who
are generally of a higher rpnk in life, jdi-
tice is apt to be con~dered as a virtue~ less
noble than charity; and which may, on
Come occasions be dispensed with. They
are humane perhaps,.and tender in their
feelings. They are easy to their depend.-
ents. They can be liberal, even to profu-
sion. While,' at the fagme time, they are
accumulating debts, which they know
themselves unable to drifcharge. Their

affairs

S ER M. affairs are allowed to run into conlfufiivnr

OI economy and good order are negleAed,
the innocent, in great numbers, fuffer
materially through their mitmnanage-
ment: Antd all the while they aframe
to themselves the praise of being gene-
rous and good-hearted men, This furelyt
is not that charity which the Gorpel
enjoins ; and which, in its very essence,
involves good conf~ienzce and integrity.-
11e who pretends to do good to his
brethren, without frir doing them jus-
~tice, cannot be accounted· their real
Sfriend. True charity is not ameteor,
which occa;ionlally glares; but a lumi-
nary, which, in its orderly and regular
course, dispenses a benignant influence.

THE third and lait adjund conneAedt

in the text with charity is, that it be of
faithL unfez'gned. Faith, in the f~cripturg
kenfe of it, includes th~e whole of religi-
ous principles refrpetti~ng God, and ref-
pe £ing Christ. Good ~principles, with-
out: good pradice, I confess, are nothing,
they are of no avail in the ight of

rincipile is likely to ·be alwayrs unit~ac
Ile and wavering;i and, ·therefore, the
gith of religious principles enters, for a
rery considerable share, ·into -the proper
lit~charge of the ·duties of charity.

It will bre adm~i~tted that, without fai~ths,

>ur duties .towa~rds GCod cannot be prol
Jerly performed. You may be assured
that your duties towards men will al-
ways .greatly sus ser from the want of it.
Faith, wrhen pure and ge~nqine, supplies
to -every part of virtue, and -in .particular
to the vTirue of charity, many motives
and affiiftances, of which the unbelie-
ver is defitu~rte. ·He who afts from
faith ats upson the high principle of re-
gard to the God who haith made him,
and to the Saviour who redeems him;
which will often flimulate him ·to his
duty when other~principles of benevo-
lence become faint and laqguid, or are
cross~ed by oppoite intereits. When he

considers

S ER M. coniiders himself as pursuing the appro-

S'I bation of that divine Being, from whom

love descends, a sacred entl~uliaiim both
prompts, and consecrates, his charitable
difpolitions. Regard~less of men, or of
human recompence, he is carried along
by a higher impulse. He a(ts with the
fgirit of a follower of the Son of God,
who not only has enjoined love, but has
enforced it by the example of laying
down his lIfe for mankind. W~hatever
he does in behalfof his fellow-creatures,
hs considers himself as doing, in·-fome de-
gree, to that divine Person, who hath
said, IrLnafmcZ cas ye hLave done it unto one
of thze le~af of these inzy brethrenz, ye have
done it unto me*Y. Hence charity is with
hzim not only a moral virtue, but a Chris~-
tian grace. It acquires additional dignity
and energy from being conne~ted with
the heavenly ftatet and the heavenly in-
habitants. He mingles with beings of a
higher order, while he is dis~charging his

of the comtmanzdmpent. Let us ever keep
in view those essential parts of a virtuous
charad~er, and pres~erve them in their
proper union. Thus thall our religion
rife into a regular and well-proportioned
edifice, where each part gives firmaneiis
and support to, another. . If any one ~of
thos~e material parts be wanting in the
gfrea~ure s if, out of our Ifyfiem ·of ;cha-

This is indeed one of the greatest and

are to depraved as to ~be without all fedie

moral qualities, which appear to them
amiable or eidimable, almot all men lay
claim; and on there-they reit their worth,
in their own estimation. But ther~e feat,
tered pieces of virtue, not uniting into
one whole, nor forming a confiffent chza-
rader, have no powerfu~l influence on
their general habits of life. From various
unguarded quarters they lie open to
temptation. Th~eir lives are full of con-

TShat s~cene is now -closed. The ta'le

of that year has bee-n told, We look for-·
ward to the year which is beginning s
and what do we behold th~ere ?-ll my
brethre, is a blank to our view : A dark

unknown

unknown preifents itiblif. We.are ent~er- 9 E R 1M.
ing on an untried, undiieovered coun-
tiry, where, as each facceed~ing mronth
comes forward, new s~cenes rnay· open;
new objeEts may engage our attention;
changes at: home or ab~road, in public or
in private affairs, may alter the whole
Rtate of our fortune. New conneaions
may be at hand to be formed, or old
ones juff about to be dissolved; perhaps,
we may have little more to do with this
world, or with any of its conneations;
we may be flanding on the verg of time
and life, and on the point of passing
into a new ~rgion of ·exiffence. In thort,
the prof~peat before us is full of awful
uncertainty. Life and death,. pr~osperity
and adverity, health~ and tieknefs, joy
and trouble, lie in one undiftinguifhable
mass, where our eye can defer~y nothing
through the obf~curitythatwraps them up.

Whlile it is thus certain that oucr timaeS

are not at our own disposal, we are
taught, by the text, that they are tir the

i two views. Our times are in the
hand of God, as a~fupreme Disposer of
events. They are in the hand of God
as a Guardian and a Father.

OurT th~nes, I fy, are i'n the lh~and of

God asl a supreme irresistible Ruler. All
tAhat is to happen to us in this and the
furcceeding years of our life,--ifany fuc-
ceeding years we ihall be allowled to fee,
--has been foreknown and arranged by
Go0d. The first view, under which hu-
man affairs present themselves to us, is
that of confus~ed and irregurlar fuwcceffion.
The events of tehe world s~eem -thrown
together by chance, like the billows of
Ithe fiea, tumbling and tof~ing over each
other, without rule or: order. All -that
is apparent to us is thle fluauation ofhu-
man caprice, and the operation of hu-
man pafflous. WFe f~ee the firife of am-
bition, and the efforts of firatagem, la-

*~ bouring to~acompiih their several pur?

poses among the societies of men. But

it' is no more tha~n the surface, the out- 8 E R M.,
fidce of things, that we 'behold. Higher
counfiels, than it is in our power to trace,
are concerned in the tranfa~t~ions of the
wor~ld:. If ~we b~elieve in God at all, as
the Governor of the unive~rse, we nault
~believe that without his providence, no-
thing happens on eart~h. He ove~r-rules,
at his ·pleafurte, the passions of men. He
bends all their defigns-into firblerviencyr
to his decree. He makes the wriath osman
to pr·ayfe him ; and refri~ains, in what

d

meafiure he think~s fit, the remainider of
warath~.t .He brings forth in t~hei~r course
all the generations of men. W5hen the
tirne is come for their entering into light,
they appear on the flage s and when the
time fixed for' their dimiffiron arriTves,
he chages thezir oukntenancee and fiends
thernaway. The time of our appear-
ing is now come, after our a~n~edtors had
left t~he~ir place, ~and gne down to the
duit. -We are at porefrent permitted to adt

, Uo violence is done to our inclination

or choice. But affuxredly there is not a
day of our life, nor an event in that day,
but was foreseen by God. That fauccer-
sion of occurrences, w~hich to us is full
of obsc~urity and darkness, is all light
and order in his view. He fees from the
beginning to the end; and bringas for-
ward every thing that happens, in its
due time and place.

OurT times are~ al together tin his h~aand.

L~et us take notice, that they are not in
the hands either of our enemies, or of
our friends. It is not in the power of
man to thorten or to prolong our life,
more or less~ than God has decreed.
Enemies may employ craft or violence
in their attacks; friends may employ
skill and vigilance for the pres~ervation of
our health and safety; but both the one
and the other can have efFe61 only as far
as God permits. They work in f~ubte~r-
viency to his purpose. By him they are
held in invisible bonds. To the exer-

~tions

WEr are to obs~erve next, that our

t~imes are in the b5anzd of God, not: only as
an almighty Disposer, but as a merci-
ful Guardian and Father. W~e are by
no means to iningine, that from race to
race, and from year to year, God [ports
with the lives of s~ucceeding generations
of men, or in the mere wantonnrels of
arbitrary power, brings them forth, and
sends them away. No; if we have any
confidence in what either the light of
nature suggests to all men, or what the
revelation of the goirpel has confirmed
to Christians, we have full ground to
.believe, that the adminiffration of hu-
man affairs is condua~ted with infinite
wisdom and goodness. The counsels of
the Almighty are indeed too deep for
our limitted; underfiandings to trace.

ness. He hides ~from us the -view ~ofl
futurity, because the view would be
dangerous and overpowering. It would
either dispirit us with visions of terror,
or intoxicate us by the difclofixre of
s~uccess. The veil which covers fr-om
our fight the events of this and of sac-
ceeding years, is a veil woven by the
hand of miercy. Our times are zin his
hand; and we have reason to be glad
that in his hand they are kept, ihut
out from our view. Submit to his plea-

SEEING OUT times arTCDOt in OUT OWn

hand, feeing futurity is unknown to us,
let .us, firit, check the vain curiosity of
penetrating into what is to c~omle. Con-
jeature about futurity we often muit;;
but upon all conjeatures, of what this
year is to produce, let us lay a proper
r-effraint. LJet us wait till God thall
bring forward events in their proper
cours~e, without withing to dif~coverr
.what he has concealed; left, if the dif-
covery were~ granted, we thould! fee ma-
~ny things, which we would with not
to h~ave se~en.

The most common propensity of

mankind is to flore futurity with what-
ever is agreeable to them; efpecia.11y in
those periods of life when imagination
is lively, and hope is ardent. Looking
forward to the year now beginning, they
are ready to promiie themselves much
from , the foundations ,of pro~perity
which they have laid; fromn the friend-

thips

t~hips and conneAions which they have SER M.,
s~ecured; from the plans of conduat III .
which they have formed. Alas ! how
deceitful do all there dreams of happi-
nes~s often prove ! While many are fCay-
ing in s-ecret to their hearts, TXo-wPorrowEe
jhall be as thisj day and mor~e abunda~ntly,
we are obliged in return to fay to them,
.Boas not thyfelfof to-morrowze, for thoue
knowefe not wh~~at a day might brzing forth.
I do not mean, that in the unknown
profp~ed which lies before us, we thould
forebode to ourselves nothing but mis-
fortunes.-May it be the pleas~ure of
H~eaven that this year run on in a placid
and tranquil tenor to us all i--But this
J fay, that in s~uch foresight of futurity
as we are allowed to take, we may ree-
kon upon it as certain, that this year
thall prove to us, as many past have
proved, a chequered fucne of some
comforts and s~ome troubt~les. In what
proportion one or other of: there~ shall
prevail in it s whether,' when it ends, it
thall leave with us' the memory of joys
or of sorrows, is to be determine4 by him

8 E R M. in whose hansds: oup ies are~l . Our wii£-

III. c dom is, to be prepared for whatever the

year is to bring s prepared to receive
comforts with thankfulness, troubles
with fortitude; and to improve both for
the great purposes of virtue and eternal
life.

ANOTHER important inff~ru~ion

which naturally aris~es from our times
not being in our own hands is, that we
ought no longer to trifle with what it is
not in our powter to prolong; but that:
we thould· make halle to live as wif~e
men; not delaying till to-morrow what
may be done to day; s ding nowre ~wi all
our migiht whclatever our handfndndeth to do i
before that nigh~t comzeth5 wh~erein no man

Amidit the uncertainty of the events

which are before us, there is one thing
we have too much reason to believe,
namely, that of us who are now affem-
bled in this congregation, and who have
Ieen the year begin, there are s~ome who
thal not fixrvrive to f~ee it clos~e. Whe-
ther it fhiall be you, or you, or I, who

thall~

Ihall be gathered to our fathers before SE RM.
the revolving y~ear has Emithed its round, f
Godl adlone knows. Ou1r time~s ar~e ~n hiZS
hand: But to our place, it is more than
probable that fomne of us thall have
gone. Couldt we foretel the month, or
the day, on which our change was to
happen, how diligent: would wve be in
s~etting our houf'e in order, and preparing
ours~elves to appear before our Maker ?
Surely, that ought to be prepared for
with most care, concerning which wye
are ignorant how soon it is to take place.
Let us therefore wlealk c~ircumfpSeE Tly and
redeem thea tim~e. Let us difmnifs those tri-
vial and furperfluous cares which burden
or corrupt our life, in order to attend to
what is of highest importance to us as
men and Christians. The beginning of
each year thould carry to us all a solemn
admonition of our folly, in negleaing
to improve faitably the years that are
past. _UIt thould call up· mifpent time
into our view, and· bd like the haind
corning forth uplon the wall, in the days

i ,charadters over againit us, a a

c thy days are numbered; thou art
·· weighed in the balance, and found
(r wanting; take care left thy kingdom
c· be on the point of departing from
'C thee."

WVHEN we confidcer, in the next

place, thtat our times, as I before il-
lustrated, are in the hand of God as a so-
vereign` D~ifofer, it is an obvious infe-
rence from this truth, that we ihould
prepare ourselves to s~ubmit patiently to
his pleafuxre, both as to the events
which are to fill· up our days, and as to
the time ofortr continuing in this world.
T~o contend with him w7e know to be
fruitlefis. The word that is gone out of
his mouth mulf iand. In the path
.which he has marked out for us, whe-
iher it be thort or long, rugged or
smooth, we muit walk. Is it not then
the didtate of wifdlom,, that we thould
previoutly reconcile ourfielves to this
fEovereign ordination, and brihg our
minds to harmonize with what is ap-

point;4

pointed to be our deffiny ? Let us for- SE RM.
tify this temper, by recalling that re- TL
fle~tion -of the wif~e man; aWho knowoeth
w zhat is good for man in this h~fe ; alll the
Sdays of his vain life Iwhich hJe fendeth as
a jhadOwL ? *

To enjoy long life, and fee many days,

is the uni~versal wih~;' and, as the with
Sis prompted by nature, it cannot be in
itself unlawful. At the fEame time, fe-
Sveral circumitances concur ~to temper
the eagerners of this wiih; and to ihow
us that it thould always be formed un-
der due fubm~iion to the wif~ier judg-
ment of Heaven. Who among us can
tell, whether, in withingfor the conti-
nuance of many years on earth, we may
not be only wishing for ai prolonga tion of
diffref~s and misery ?--You might live,
Smy friends, till you had· undergone lin-
gering rounds of severe pain, from vihich
death would have proved a seasonable
.deliverance. You ·might live till your
breasts were pierced with many a wound
from public calamities or private sorrows.

vived all those who love you; till you
were left as desolate firangers on earth,
in the midst: of a new race, who neither
knew you, nor cared~for you, but who
wi thed you off the stage.- Of a nat ure lo
amnbiguous are all the profpeaPs which life
fCets before us, that in every wi fh we form,
relating to them, much reas~on we have
to be sat~isfied that our times are in the
hands of God, rather than our own.

Tu I s consideration is greatly fireng th-
ened when, in the lait place, wethinkof
God aaing, not as a sovereign only, but
as a Guardian~, in the difpoal of our
timles. This is our great consolation in
looking forward to futurity. To God
as a wife Ruler, calm f~ubmbfion is due;
but it is more than fixbmillion that be-
- 10ngs to him as a merciful Father; it is

the s~pirit of cordial and affe~tioniate con-
sent to his will. Unknown to us as the:
times t'b comne are, it thrould be furfficien't

to our fix11 repore: that they a~re known to sE R b.
God. The day and the hour which are jl
fice~d in his ou~nfets for our dif~iffi~on
from life, we ought to be persuaded are
fixed for the best s and that any longer
we thould not with to remain.

When we fee that lait hour drawing

nigh, though our sp~irits may be com-
posed on our own account, yet, on ac-
count of our friends and families, no
little anxiety and sorrow may be some-
tunes apt to take posses Bon of the mind.
Long we have enjoyed the comfort of
their foiety, and been acculftomed to
confider theml as parts ofourf~elv·es. To
be parted from them for ever is, at any:
rate, a bitter thou~ght; bu~t to the bitter-
ness of this, is ov~er and above added the
apprehension of their f~uffering much by
our death. We leave many a relation,
perhaps may leave young children, and a
helpless family, behind us, to be expos~-
ed to various dangers, and: thrown forth
on an unfriendly world. Sulch v~ir tu-
ozs anxieties often oppres~s the tender
and feeling heart at the closing periods

th~ould they be fors~aken by him in

the world before you had a being in it :
Well thall he continue; to govern it as-
ter you are no more. No cause~ have you,
therefore, to oppres~s your minds with the
load of unknown futurity. Commit your
cares to a Father in heaven. Surrender'

When we look around us, nothing is

_more cons~picuous in the Atte of the

and the wicked, which we find taking

pref~eat dircourf~e, together w~t~h such re-
1lediarsf~ as niaturally - ar~ise from fiirvey-
ing ~the ithtero? hairi~an affairs.

SBUr, before e~nterifi 'dikttly on A~icts

inquiry, it may be proper to take no- SER M.
tice, that, in our eitimatfion of who are V
the good, who are the bad, we are often
in hazard of committing zpiftakes. The
real charaders of men are known only
to God. They frequently depend on the
secret and unseen parts of life, As in
judging of thems~elves men are always
partial, so in judging of others they of'
ten err, through the impedfed informa-
tion which they have gathered, or the
rash prejudices which they have formed.
They are too apt to limit the charader
of virtue to those who agree with there,
in f~eatiment and helief; and to exagges-
rate the failings of those againRt whom
they have conceived dislike, into great
and unpardonable crimes. Were it left to
the indiscreet zeal of some to extirpate
from the earth all those whom they con-,
lider as bad men, there is ground to ap-
prehend that, initead of tares the wheat
would often be rooted out.-At the [~ame
tim~e, we readily admit the sea~, as too
iminifret t9 be genied~r, that it muitude

of"

& E gM.of gross and notorious sinners are now

Smixed with the followers of God and

viriftue. Cet us proceed then to confider
how far this is consistent with the juiti-
tice and ~wisdom of the Governor of the
ivorld.

Ic xy; a principle in which all serious:

and reflefting persons have agreed, and
which by many arguments is confirrmed,
that our present slate on earth is designed
to be a slate of diicipline and improve-
ment, in order to fit hiuman nature for a
higher and better state which it is to at-
tain hereaft~er. Now, this principle being
once admitted, we fay, that the mixture
of virtue and vice which here prevails, is
calculated to anfwver this purpose better
than a mor~e unmixed and perse it fate
of society would have done.

Fox, in the first place, the crimes of'

the wicked give occasion to the exercise
of: many extellenf djipofitions of heart
;8nong the righteous. They bring forth

aill the f~uffe~ring virtues, wihich other wife S ER M.
~would have had no field; and by the Iv.L
exercif'e of which the human chiaradfer is
tried, and syquires rome. of its chief
hionourrs. Wre there no ~bad men in the
w~orld to vex and distress the good, the
good might: appear in the light of harm-·
les~s innocence; but could have no op-
portunity of diifplaying fidelity, magna-
nimity, patience, and fortitude. One half
of virtue, and not the leait important
half wrould be led to the world. In
our prefeat imperfea.itate, any virtue
which is never exercis~ed is in hazard of
becomning extinat in the human breait.
If goodness conitantly proceeded in a
sm-ooth and flowery paths if, meeting
with no adverfaryg to oppoie it, it were
fiurrounded on every hand with acclama-
tion and praire, is there no ground to
dread that it might be corrupted by va.
nity, or might Iink into indolence ?This
dangerous calm mnud ther~efore be inter-r
rupted. The waters mui be troubled,
kB they thould ftagoate and putrify.

W~hes

s ER M. When you behold wicked men multiply-

I ing in number, ~and increating in power,

imagine not that Providence particularly
favours them. No; they are f~uffered for
a time to pros~per, that they may fulfil
the high designs of heaven.. They are
employed as infiruments in the hand of
God for the improvement of his fCervants.
They are the rods with which he chaf-
tens the virtuous, in order to route them
from a dangerous slumber s to form them
for the day of adversity, and to teach
them how to fuffer honourably.

IN the next place, the mixture of the

had among. the good serves not only to
give exercise to the passive graces, but al-.
so to improve the adtive powers and vir-
tues of man. It inures the rig~hteous to
vigilance and exertion. It obliges them
to stand forth, and sa t~heir part with
Afrmnneifs and conflancy in evil times. It

the dlangers that aris~e from abounding IL
iniquity, there would b~e no opportunity
.for courage to sa, for wisdom to admo-
nifh, for caution to watch, nor for faith
to exert itself in overcominaig the world. It
'is that mixture of dispositions which now
takes place, that renders the theatre on
which we aA so~ bufyT and fl~irring, and
tio much fitted for giving employment to
every part of man's intelligent and moral
nzature. It affords a complete field for the
genuine dis~play of charadters ; and gives
every man the opportunity to come forth
and thow wha~t he is. W~ere the tenor of
huxman conduat altogether regular and
uniform, interrupted by no follies and
.vices, no cross difpolitions and irregular
:passions, many ofour sative powers would
find no exercis~e. Perha~ps even our life
would languish, and become too still and
insipid. Man isnot yetripe fora pa~rq

of a perfedanfd faultless s~ociety. ~As~in

mixture of bad men renders many an exi
ertion necessa~ry, which in a more perfedt
Rtate of the world would find no place,
·but whic'h in the prefbunt itate of trial is
proper and uf~eful.--TThe exiffence of
vice in the world assuredly teffifies our
present corruptian; and according to the
degree of its preval3encec, is always, more
or less, the s~ource of miifery. It is a fland,
ing proof of the fall and degeneracy of
man. liut as long as that fall~en Rate~
continues, the wildon .of Prosvidence
eminently appears in making the errors

TIHESE observations on the wifidomt of

only from~ the advices of hls friends, but
fr.om the reproaches of his enemies, a
·wif~e man may draw infiruaion. In the
fame manner, it is not only by the exi
amples of good men, but likewise by
those of the wicked, that an attentive
(nind may be confirmed in virtue..

N~ext, THESE examples of bad men,

while they admonith the virtuous of the
dangers againft.which they are to guard,
are farther profitable by the views which
they exhibit of the evil and the defor-
mity offin. Its odious nature never ap-
pears in to firong a light as'when dif~

played in the crimes of the .wicked. It is S ER 1V.
true that, when vice is carried on1y to a , "'
certain degree, and di~g~uifed by plausible
colours, it may pass unreproved, and
even for a while s~eem popular in the
world. But it is no less true that, when
it becomes op~en and flagrant, and is de-
prived of the thadow of virtue, it never
fails to incur general reproach, and to
become the: obje~t either of contempt or-
of hatred. How often, for inflance, hlave
the greateit abilities, which once drewY
efleem and~admiration, fim~k, in a thnort
time, into the moss hiumiliating degrada-
tion, m erely through the arceen dant which
corrupted inclinations and low habits had
acquired over their p0Keffero ? How of-
ten have the rising honours of the young
been blasted, by their fortak~ing the path
of honour on which they had once enter-
ed, for the blind and crooked traccs of
depravity and folly ? Such i[petac-lesof
the infa~my ~of v~ice, such memorials of
the disgrace attending it, are permitted
bKy, Providence for general infirudion;

an-d

se E M. and aff~urdly are edifying to the world,

L It was necessary, for moraf improvement,

that the beauty and excellence of virtue,
and the deformity of vice, thould be
dirongly impressed on every intelligerit
mind. This could never be done with
so great advantage as by the firiking con-
trafts of both which are produced by the
living examples of evil men intermixed
w~iith the good. It is in thiis mirror that
we clearly contemplate how much the
righteous is more exrcellent th2an Mis nery,

a hur.

THaE f'ame purpo-re of- important its,

fIruftion is farther promoted by the in-
flances of misery which the slate of wick-
ed men on eart~h affords, I admit that
the worldly faccefs, whichfometimes at-
tends them, may blind and s~educe the
unwary; but a little more refle~ttion ena-
bles men to diftinguith between apparent
iiuccefs and real happinceis The condi-

dor riches mmay throw around them, is

ferable one s and thre misery which they ,Iv.
fuffer, to be derived from the~ir vices. In,
that great corrupted crowd which fur-
ro~unds us, what incessant buffle and flir,
vihat agitation and tumult take place ?
What envy and jealousy ofone another9
How much bitterner~s of res~entment do
we behold among them; mutually de-
ceiving and deceived; supplanting and
s~upplanted; ever pursuing, but never fa-
tisfied? These~ are not matters of rare ob-
servation, or which require nice icrutiny
to diicover thein. We need only open
our eyes to behold the wicked tormented
by their passions, and far removed from
that fanituary of calmneis and tranquil-
lity which is the abode of real happineis.
NTay, when we appeal to bad men them-
selves, after they have run the whole.
round of vicious pleasures, we will often
find thern obliged to cotifefs, that the
wretched result of their pursuits has been
vanity and vexration of fptiirit and that the
happiest days they have enjoyed were in

the

SEgR M. the times of innocence j before criminale

,I.defires and guilty passions had taken

poffefilonn of their breasts. Such prac-
tical demonfirations as these of the infe--
licity of fin are yielded by the exa-
ples of evil doers whom we f'ee arondfc
us. By attending to their situation, the
misery, as well as infamy of guilt is rea-
lifed, and rendered se~nsible to our ap-
prehenflon.

TNUS,· upon a fair inqluiry, you be-

hold how the ways of'God may, in this
remarkable caf~e, be juffifiedtonrian. You
behold what important ends are advan-
ced, by permitting the tares at present
to growze together wzcith thle weAeat. The
intermixture of evil men in huxman so-
ciety s~erves to exercise the Efufering gra-
ces and virtues of the good; -by the di-
verfity of charadters among thofie with
whom they have intercourse, it serv~es to
bring forth and improve· their sative
powers and virtues, and to enla~rge the
circle of useful occupations; it fet'ves to

which they are to guard, to reveal to J
them all the defor-mity of vice, and to
make its mis~eries pass~ cons~picuously be-
fore their eyes. When we confider them
a ed~ors on the theatreof the world, they
are thereb~y improved in the part they
have to perform. When we confider
them as [pedators of what is passing
on that theatre, their minds are thereby
infitruded; their views redtified and en-
larged by the objeas that are sEt before
them.

FROM there important truths, several

refleaions no les~s important arise.

WeBr are naturally. taught, in the firit

placesever to be hasty in finding fault
with any of the arrangements of Provi-
dence. The pres~ent permifrlon of moral
evil on the earth-f~eemed, on the first
views to furn ifh a firon gobj eaion againit

the Author of nature. After beholding

C we be in advancing any of our rath fpe-

culations ag-ainst hisgovernmentand conl-
dua! To our confined and humble fla-
tion it belongs not to cen ture, bu t to sub -
mit, truss, and adore; fagtisfied that ta~
farther we in quire, the reditude of his
ways will appear the more; thankful for
the discoveries of them whi~ch have been
imparted to us; andpaerfuaded that, where
our discoveries faitl, it is not because
there is no more wis-dom or goodness
to be seen, but because our prefenat
condition allows us not to fee rp~ore.

IN- the second place, let us be taught

witlfwhat eye we are to, look upon those~
bad men whom we find around. us in the
world. NJot fi-rely with an eye of envy.
Whatever prosperity they may fCeem to
enjoy, they are feill no more than taresj
the weeds of the field, contem~pt~ile in
the fight of God; tolerated by his pro-,
vidence for a while on account ofthe righ -
teous, to whofre improvement they are

rendered

rendered s~ubservient. The parable in- S ER IV.
forms us that, in· the end, they are to be
g~athtered togethei- andburnt. In ;this life
only they have their g-ood thzings. But
h~eir pros~perity is tradfitory. 'They are
br~ought in~zto defilatioz ~inamoment, anzd ut-
ter~y conJ;;mled wrzit h terrors. As adream
wihen one nawaketh, so, O God, whe~en th~ou
awa7keJf , thsou f alt despise their imzage*t.--
WThen weconfider their unhappy itate, it
becomes us to behold them with the eye
of pity. Let us remember that, in the
midst of their errors, they ai-e by riature
Aill~ our brethren. Ltet us not behave to
them in the spirit of bitternels. Insult
not their follies. Pride not yourselves
on superior virtue. Remember that, as
bad men are mixed with the good, so, in
the beiR men, vices are at pres~ent mixed
with virtues. Your owri charader, good
as you may eiteem it, is not free from
every evil taint; and in the charadters of

you can, to reclaim and amend tphem ;
and if, in any degree, you have been prog

turn, to profit them, by good counsel
and advice; by advice, not: adminiffer-
ed with officious zeal, or felf-conceit-
ed superiority, but with the tenderneis
of compaflion and real friendship.

IN the third place, in whatever pro-

portion the admixture of vice may feemn
to take place in the world,-let us never
derp~air of the prevalence of virtueon the
whole. Let us not exaggerate, beyond
mneafu re the quantity of vice tha tis found
in the mixture. It is proper toobf~erve,
that in the parable now before us, after
the owner of the f2eld had fo'Wn hiSj good
feed, no reason is given us to think, that
the good feed was entirely choked up by
tares. On the contrary, we are told that

the end there was a barvef~, when the ~,
wreheat wreas re~aped anda gath~ered ~into th~e
barn. In the most corrupted times, God
never leaves himself without many wit-
neffes on earth. He is always attentive
to the cause of goodness; and frequent-
ly supports and advances it by means
wyhich we are unable to trace. He nou1-
rithes much piety and virtue in hearts
that are unknown to us; and behrolds re-
pentance ready to ·Ipring up among ma-
ny whom we confider as reprobates.--I
know that it has always been common
for persons to repres~ent the age in which
they live as the worit that ever appeared;
and religion, and virtue as just on the
point of vanishing from among men.
This is the language s~ometimes of the
I'erious; often of: the: hypocritical, or of
the natrow-minded, But true religion
gives no fanation to futch frevere centures,
or s~uch gloomy views. Though thetares
muilb'eat all times [pringing up, there is
no reafoa for believing that they thall

ever

S.E R M. ever overspread the whole field. The

~f~ nature of the weed$ that [p~ring up may

vary, according to the nature of the foil.
Different modes of iniquity may dif~in-
guiih different ages of the world; while
the fuzm of corruption is nearly the fame.
Let not our judgments. of men, and of
the times in which we live, be hasty and
]presumptuous. ~Let us trun in the grace
of God; and hope the bell of mankind.

IN the four th and lait place, 1et us keep
our eyes ever fixed: on that important pe-
riod, which is alluded to in the text, as
the conclusion of all. Let both growe to-
gether until th5e harvef . T he great fpiri-
tual year is to be closed by a barveef,
when the houfebJolder is to gather the whea~rt
into his barn~ j when, at the end of the
world,,the final diitindtion of men and
charaders is totakeplace. Trheconfu~fed
mixtureof goodandevil, whichnowpre-
vails, is only a temporary dispensation of
Provgidence, accommodated to man's fall
len audimperfed Rtate. Letit not tempt

j r· --us

us for a moment to Idiircui the reality SER a M.
of the divine government s or to enter- V
tain the remoteit futpicion that moral
good and evil are to be on the fame
terms for ever,. The frailties of our
nature fitted us for no more at present
than the enjoyment of a very mixed and
impedfed society. But when our na-
ture purified atnd refined,: thall becom~e
ripe for higher advancement, then thiall
the ipirits of the just, dise~ngaged fr~om
any polluted mixture, unciiturbed by

the presence of him who made them.

S ER M. )rTl H~E life of man on earth is doom-

,V·_ . ed to be clouded with variouis

evils. Throughout all ranks, the
afflifted form a considerable. proportion
of the human race; sand- even they
who have a title to be called prefpe-
rous, are always, in some periods ol
their life, obliged to drink froga~ the

cuy

cup of bitterneifs. The Christ~ian reli·- S ER M.
gion is particularly entitled to our re- rV
gard, by accommodating its~elf with
great: tenderness to this diff reffred condi-
tion of mankind. It isnot to beconfi-
dered as merely an authoritative iylieux
of precepts. Important precepts it in-
deed delivers for the wife and pi-oper re-
gulation of life. But the fame voice
which enjoins our duty, utters the
words of consolation. The gorpel de-
serves to be held a difipellfation of relief
to mankind under both the temporal
and s~piri~tual distresses of their slate.

This amiable and compassionate ipirit

of our religion cons~picuously appears in
the chara~ter of its great Author. It
ihone in all his aations while he lived on
earth. It breathed in all his dis~charges;
and, in the words of the text, is expressed
with much energy. In the preceding
verse, he had given a high ac~count of his
own person and dignity. Allthings are
d8elivered untto me o~f my Fathber ; and no
man knowreth the Son but th5e Fazther ; nei'-
:i#er knowethtt any man the Father,. face

the

S ER M. the Sonz, anzd he to whe~omfoever· the Son wie'll

thould be discouraged -by this my fierious
representation of his greatness;, he in-
flantly tempers it witlythe moit graci-
ous benignity; declaring, in the text,
the merciful intention of his mifflon to
the world, Comne unto mte, all ye that la~2-
boulr and are heavy lasden, and I ·-il'l gino
youl reJ .

TH E firbt thing which claims our at-

tention in t~hese ·words is, what we are to
understand by comin~g unto Chrt/. . This
is a phrase~ which has often -given occa-
sion to controvertyl. -By theological wri,-
ters it has been inv~olved in much need-
less` myfkery, while the meaning is in it-
self plain and eafyr. The very metaphor
that is here ufred ~e~rves to explain it. In
the ancient world, disciples flocked
round their diffe~rent teachers, and at~-
tended them' wherever they went; in
order ·both to .testify- th~eir attachment,
and to imbibe more fully the doariiae
of their makters. Comig~g unto Chrg,~ ·

thierefore,

therefore, is the fame with resorting gSE R1V
to him as our declared Maiter 3 ac- v.,
knowledging ourselves his dis~ciples, be-
lievers in his doatrine, and followers of
his precepts. As ChriiR is made known
teo us under the charaaecr both of a
Teacher and a Saviour, our comping to
h~im imports not only fu~bmiflion to his
initru~tions, bLut confidence also in his
power to save. It imports that, for-
faking the corruptions of ful and the
world, we ~follow that course of' virtue
and obedience which he points out to
us; relying on his mediation for par-
don of our offences, and acceptance
with heaven. This is what is impli-
ed in the [cripture term Faith, which
includes both the assent of the under-
itanding to the truth of~ the Chriitian
religion, and ~the concurrence of the
Will 111 TeCCCVing it.

M7HAT nCXt OCCurS in the text to

ed. All thpfe w~ho labour, and are

Sor other, feel themselves grieved <nd

.;difireffed, are here invited to come to

~ii Chrift-Nrow, from two sources

chiefly our diirffreks arise; from mo-
ral, or from natural cageis.

S~irs ~, THE Y may arise from inward

moral caus~es; from certain feelingos and
reflexions of thBe mind, which occasion
uneasiness and pain. A course of fin
and vice always proves ruinous and de-
firuaive in the ifrue. But its tendency
to ruin is often not perceived, while
that tendency is advancing. For as
fin is the reign of pation and pleas~ure,
it forms men to a thoughtleis inconfi-
derate slate. Circumflances, however,
may -occur' and frequently, in the
cours~e of life, do occur which disclose
to a vicious man the ruin which he is
.bringing on himself, as an offender
againit the God who made him. When
some occasional confinan~ent to soli-
tude, or some turn of adverse fortune,
direats his attention humediately upon

, lus

his own charader; o b when, drawing to- 8 E R M.
wards the close of life, his pafirons sub- L
fide, his pleasures withdraw, and a fu- ii
ture itate comes forward to his view; 1
in such situations it often happens,
that the pall: f&Ties and crimes of such a
man appear to him in a light moRt odi-
ous and thocking; and not odious only,
but terrifying to his heart. He confi-
ders that he is undoubtedly placed un-
der the government ofa juff God, who -b
did not fend him into this world for
nought; that he has negleated the part
assigned to him; has contemned the laws
of heaven; has degraded his own na-
ture s and initead of being useful, hav-
ing been hurtful and pernicious to those
among whom he lived, is about to i
leave a deteitable memory behind him.
-What account thall he give of him-
self to his maker ? Self condemned,
polluted by to many crimes, how can
he exped to fid m~ercy in ·his fight ?-

Sand has sometimes rend~ered exiflence a
burden whichi could not be endured.

Such distresses as therfe, arising from

moral internal caules, m~iy be made light
of by the giddy and the vain; and re-
pres~ented as confined to a few persons
only ofdiftempered imagination. But to
·thofCe whole~ profefr~ons give them occa-
i ion to fe~e men under various circumitan-
ces ofaffliAion, they are known to be
far from being unfrequent in the world;
and, on many more occasions than is
comnmonly imagined, to throw over the
human; mind the blackest gloom of
wt~hich it is fuficeptible. REeligious fee-
''lings, be assured;` have a deep root in the
nature of man. They· form a part of the
human conflitution. They areinterwov.
en with many of t~hose fears and hopes
which ad~uate us in the ch~aiing situ-
ations of fortune. During the gay and
adive periods of life, they mnay be imo-
thered; but with most men, they are
bhothered rather than total~ly obliterated:

And

And if any crisis of our condition thall SER M.11
awaken,- and bring them forth, in their L
fu~llforce, upon a conscious guilty heart,
woe to the man, who, in some dificon-
solate s~eason, is doomed to furffer their
e~xtreme vengneane!

BuT, while under fach diftfreffes of·

·the mind not a few may be said to la-
b~our and to be heavy laden, greater still is
the mult-itude of those who, from natural
external caule~s, from th~e calamities and .
evils of life, undergo much fuffering and
mis~ery. The life of manr is not indeed
wholly compo~ed of mis~ery. It admits
ofmany pleasing scenes. On the whole,
there is reason to believe that it affords
more joy than grief. At the fame time,
the unfortunate, as I before observed,
form always a numerous clas~s of man-
kind; and it may be said with truth, that
fore travel is ordained for the sons of ~men.
Though the burdeals not equally laid on
all; fome~there always are, on whom it
falls with oppressive weight. Unexpea-
ed disappointments have crathed their

I- had formed for comfort in the world.

,The world had, perhaps, iimiled upon
them once, only to give them a tharper
feeling of its mise~ries at the lafti Strug-
gling with poverty, una~blle to s~upport:
their families whom they fee langouilha-
ing around them, they, at'the f~amt
time, are obliged by their situation in
society to conceal their necessities; and
under the forced appearance of cheerful-
ness, to hide from the world a broken
heart. They are flung, perhaps, by
the unkindnes~s of friends ; cast off by
those in whom they had truffed; or
torn by untimely death from .real
friends, in connexion with whom they
mighFt have flourithed and been happy;
at the fam~e time borne down, it may
be, with the infirmities of a sickly
body, and left to drag a painful life.
without afif~tance or relief. How

to allow the fo~llowers of Christ to dread,
that, in any situation of fortune, they

That fantua~rL in which the wound-

greater obje~tt o·apeiz to outr view than,

$ whait

s E M. what the world presents; where a miore

fL~erene fkry thines, and a tweeter and
calmer light beams on the afffided heart.
In those moments of devotion, a pious
man, pouring out his wants and f or rows
to an almighity Supporter, feels that he is
not left solitary and forl~aken in a vale
of woe. God' is with him; ChriB and
the Holy .Ghost atre with ~him; and,
though he thold be bei-eaved of every
earthly friend, he can loolseup -in he~aven
to a Friend who will never die.

To ther~e pres~ent conrfolations, the re-

ligion of Chriid adds the joyful profped
of that future Rtate, where eternal reJZ re-
maineth for the people of God. This life
they are taught to confider as only the
house of their pilgrim~age; the temporary
mansion of painful though necessary disC-
cipline. But let them endure for a little,
and the pilgrimage shall end,] the dif-
cipline shall be finithed; and all the vir-
tuous be assembled in thlofre bli~fsfidl re-
gions which are prepaired- for their re-
ward. Such aprofped cfkears the dark-

eit hours of life; and affords a remedy s E 14 IV.
to every troulble. f'The fufe~irin~gsof this. L
pre~ent time are not worthy3 to j comparedi
reith the glory wheick fkall be revealed*,
They appear in this comparative viewv,
as' no more than a difkreiling dream of
the night, froin which one awakes into
hea i, and lig~ht, and joy.--Peculiar is
thisthigh confola tion to the religion of
Chrid. It is what all nations had eager-
ly withed for; what all philosophy had
anxiodly fought to discover s but what
no research, no philosophy. were able to
as~certain to mankind, till Chriik brought
the afrurance of life and immortality
from heaven; and conferred on his dif~-
ciples this noble and inestimable gift.

Tatrs, on the whole, the Christian

doarine is found to be the great Medi-
cine of life. It is the balm of hurran fo~r.
rows and cares. In our present aate,

I mean, who 'labouring under none of

under the burden only of languid ease,
and- the load of insipid pros~perity.

i ,they gradually contradted habits of

luxury; and luxury soon introduced
its usual train of attending evils. In
the history of all nations, the f~ame
c~irculation of maanners has been found~;
and the age in which we live refemn-
bles, in this refped, the ages which
hiave gonebefore it. Forms of iniquity
may vary; but the corrupt propensities
of men remain at all times much the
f~ame; and revolutions from primitive
simplicity to the refinements of eriminal
luxury have been often exhibited on the
fl~age ofthe world. The reproofdireat-
ed in the text to the Jews of that an-
tient age, will be found equally appli-
cable to the manners of many, in mo-
dern -times. ( In discoursing flrom it, I
thall first confider the charadter of those
who1 are deferibed in the text, and ihow
the guilt that is involved in it. I h~all
next confider the duties which persons
of that ch-,raater are suppose2d to have

negleAed ;

negleaed ; to r-egar~d th5e weork of thte SE 4.
Lord, and to confdePr thGe opearaion of his A
hanzds.

I. WVHEN we take into view the cha-

raater pointed at in the text, it is evident.
that what the prophet means to reprove
is, the spirit of inconsiderate dissipation,
ofintemnperate indulgence, and irreligi-
ous luxury. It is not the fe~afi and th5e
wizne, th5e h5arp anzd the uiol, which he
means to condemn. M~usic and wine
are, in themselves, things of innocent
nature: Nay, when temperately enjoy-
ed, they may be employed for useful
purposes s for aiffording relaxaition from
the oppre~iive cares oflife, and for pro-
moting friendly intercourfie among men.
The opulent are not prohibited from
enjoying the good things of this world,
which providence has beffowed upon
them. Religion neither abolithes the
diftinaion of ranks, (as the vain philo-
sophy of some wouild teach us to do),
nor interfere~s with a modest and decent
indulgence of pleafure.-cIt - is the

It m~ay be proper to remark, that it is

not open and direa impiety, which -is
laid to the charge of the p~ersons here
char-a~terif~ed. It is not sidi, that in th~eir
feasts they faiffed at religion, or blaf-
phemed the namne of G~od. T~o -this
furmmit of wickednefi~is theri~e p:er~fols had
not yet arrived; per~haps, the ·age in
w~hich they lived gave· not its counte-
nance to this wantonness of impiety.

vI. Lord, we are also to confider the never

cealing operation of hishan;ds·. We are
to look up to an awiful and irresistible
Providence, firetching its arm over our
heads; direfting the fate of men, and
dis~pensing at its pleas~ure happines~s or
misery. In the giddy moments of jol-
lity, the wanton and thoughtleis are
apt to fay: ** Let uls eat and drzink, for

IC nute attention on the sons of earth.
·e He permits all things to come alike to
"C all; one event to hbappen to th5e righte-
cc ous and to the wio~cked."-Be assured,
my brethren, it is not so. You great-
ly deceive yourselves, by· imagining that
your Creator and Governor is indiffe-
rent to the part you are now adting s
or that -the diffribution of good and·
evil, which now takes place, has sio

rel~ation

be apparent, becaule the moral govern-
ment of God is not completed in~ this
world. ~But a multitude of proofs thowY
government to be already ;begun; and
point out to you the train in which you
may exped it to proceed.

In the hiffory of all ages and nations,

you cannot but have observed a thousand
instances, ti in which5 the operations ofthbe
divine hand.has been dis~played; over-
taking evil doers s~ooner or later with
punishment, and bringing ln their own
heads the ruin they had devis~ed for
others. You are not to imag~ine that
this difpleafoure of Providence is exerted
only against the ambitious, the treache-
·rous, and the cruel, who are the authors
of extensive misery to the world. Un-
der this idea, perhaps, you may be de-
fiirous to thelterr yours~elves, "that your
excesses are of a heroxleis kind; that you
fbek nothing more than the enloyment
of your own pleasures; that your feaff

s.ER M. Ther~e things have been always to ap-

V parent to observation, that though a man

may have been seduced into irregular
and evil cours~es during his life, yet, at
the close of it, it s~eldom happens but he;
discerns their pernicious nature, and con-
d2emns himself fo~r them. NIever, per-
haps, was there a father, who, after he
had s~pent his daysin idleneis, difirpation,
and luxury, did not, when dying, admo-
nithn the children whom he loved, to hold
a more hiono~urab~le course, to follow the
paths of virtue, to fear God, and to fulfil
properly the cduties of their flation.--To
yours~elves, indeed, I can confidently ap-
peal, whether what l am now saying, be
not confirmed by your own testimony.
After you have been guilty of some cri-
minal aats, in the course- of those riotous
pleasu~res which you indulge, have you
not, at certain timnes, felt 'the flings of
remorse ? Were you not obliged to con-
fess to' yours~elves that a fad profpeat of
rn-ifery was opening before you, if s~uch
excesses were to continue ? Did you -not

.hear

hear an inward voice upbraiding you for S EVRIVI.
having fiink and degraded your charac- c
ter so far below that of many of your
equals around yrou?-My friends, what
was this but the voice of God, [peaking,
as the Governor o~f his creatures, within
your heart; teffifying loudly that your
course of life was difpyleafing to him;
and warning you of punithments that
were to follow ? If his displeas~ure against
you is already begun to be teffified, can
you tell where it is to flop, or how long
it may continue to pursue you throughout
future flages of your -exiffenlce ? Whio
knowethE the polwer of his· wPrath2?-T~o
this awvful, this warning- voice, will you
not be pers~uad~ed reverently to liflen ?
Impreifed by the dread authority which
it carries, shall you not fall down on your
knees before your Maker, imploring his
mercy to pardon your past offences, and
his grace to redify your futusre way ?

VI I,~ry serious nature. When we regard~ te

*weork of the Lord, and contemplate himr
as the Author of the universe, s~uch conI-
templation prompts devotion. But when
we con/der the opera~Eilan of his hands in
providence, and contemplate him as the
Governor of mankind, [uch contempla-
tion prompts humiliation before him for
offe~nces committed. The former ad-
dresses itself to the ingenuous s~entiments
that are left in the~heart s and awakens
a sense of our unworthiness~, in neglec-
ting the Author of nature, amidst our
riotous~pleafures, The la~tter addressee
itself to our regard for fafetyr and happi-
ners; adnd~ awfakens fear and dread, from
conf~cioufunefs of the guilt wre have con-
trafted. Hence i-prings up in everyl
thoughtfill m~ind, an anxious concern to
avert the displeasure, and regain the fa-
vour of that - Supreme Being to whom
we are all fubjeat. This, amonrg unen-
lightened .cations, ga~ve rife' to facrif ices,
expiations, and all the rites of humnble;
though f~uperititious~ worthip. Among

nations, who have been ~inftlruded in liER IV
true religion, sentiments of the fame I
nature pave the way for prayer, repen- V~
tance, faith, and all thos~e duties, by
means of wvhih w~e may hope, throuigh
it divine Mediator and initerceffor, to be
reconciled to heaven. Natural and re-
vealed religion here appear in concord.
We behold the original didtates of the
human heart laying a foundationi for the
glad reception of the comfortable tidi
ings of the gospel.

I HAVE thus endeavoured to thew in

what manner, by regar-ding th2e w~ork of
the Lord, and considering the operation of
his hands, we may prevent the dangers
arising from a thoughtles~s indulgence of
pleasure s we may be furnished with an
antidote to the poison which is too often
mixed in that intoxicatingcup. Human
life is full of troubles. We are all tempt-
ed to alleviate them as much as we can,
by freely enjoying the pleasurable moi
ments which Providence thinks fit to al-

low

8 ER M.lowus. Enijoy them we may: But, if

V we would enjoy them Edely, and enjoy

them long, let us temp~er themn with the
fear ofGObd. As soon as this is forgotten
and objliterated, the fbund of the h2arp
aznd th~e ·viol is changed into the signal of
death. The serpent ·comes fbrth from
the roles where it had lain in ambuth,
and givies the fatal fling. Pleasure iri
mnoderation is the cordial, in excess~ it is
the bane, of life,

Godis fulne/s of joy, and at his righte handi
there are pleasures for evermore.

I. Throue wilt./ese me the pathis of li~fe.

This plainly imports that there are dif-
ferent path2s or courf~s of condua, which
may be purs~ued by men in this world;
a path which leads to life or happiness,
and a path which if-~ues in death or de-
firu~ion. There opposite lines of con-
duB are determined by the choice which
men make of virtue or of vice; and hence
mnen are divided into two great class~es,
according as their inclinations lead them
to good orto evil. Tie pathofjfe is of-
ten a rough and difficult path, followed

only

8 E R M. Only by a few. The opposite one is the

V'ru. broad way, in which the multitude

walk; i eemingly finooth, and fkrevied
with flowers; but leading in the end to
death and mis~ery. The path1 of lyje con-
du;As us up a sleep ascent. The palace
of virtue has, in all ages, been represent-
ed as placed on the fuxmmit of a hill s in
the ascent of which labour is requisite,
and difficulties are to be fuzrmounted;
and where a condudtor is needed, to di-
re&t our way, and to aid our fleps.

Now, the hope which good men en-

tertain is that this path oflyfe Ihall be
thewn them by God; that, when their
intentions are upright, God will both in-
firuR them concerning the road which
leads to true happiness, and will afiift
them to pur~u~e it f~uccefsfully. Amqng
nations where any fauitable ideas of God
or of virtue began to be formed, hopes
of this nature also began to be entertain-
ed. It was consonant to t~he nature of
man, to think that the Supreme Being
was favourable to virtue. Accordingly,

in the writinigs of s~ome of the ancient S ER IVL
philosophers, we find various obscure lt
traces 'of this belief, that there was a
benign heavenly [pirit, who illuminated
the minds of the virtuous, and assisted
their endealrours to ob~tain wifdtom and
happiners. They even asserted, that
no man became great or good without
some ins~piration of heaven.

But what they indiftinAly conceived,

and could not with confidence rely upon,
the doatrine of Christianity hath clearly
explained and fully confirmed; express-
ly and frequently teaching, that not only
by the external disc~overies of revelation,
but by the inward operations of his Spi-
rit, he ./kewss to the humble and virtu-
ous the path of2fe. While, by his word,
he infiruas them in their duty, by the
influence of his grace he afifts them in~
the performance of it. In ll revelation
there is certainly no dearine~ more com.,
sortable than this. It is to good men
a noble and pleasing thought, that they
are purfuxing a path which! God has· dif-

covered

8 ER M. coveredl and pointed out to them. For,

VI..they know that every path, in which he

is their condua~or, mufft be honourable,
muff be safe, muff bring them in the end
to felicity. They follow that Sk~epherd
oflf~rael, who always leads his flock into
gr-een pac/uzres, and makes the~m lie dowen be-
Jide thze fill ·waters. At the fame time,
they know that, if there be truth in re-
ligion at all, on this principle they may
securely reft, that the Divine Being will
inever desert those who are endeavouring
to follow out, as they can, the path
wt~hich he has thewn them He beholds
t~hem here in a slate of great imbecility;
surrounded with much darkness; expos`-
ed to numberless dangers, from the
temptations that assault them .writhout,
and the feduaion of misguided and
disorderly passions within. In this si-
tuation, can they ever fuitped that the
Father of mercies will leave his servants,
alone and unbefriended, to Itruggle up
the ·.hill of virtue, without firetching
forth a compafironate arm to aid their
frailty, -and to guide them through the

The fountain of i~fe is juffly [aid to be

dent Being mu fs necef farily possess within
himf'elf every prianciple ofbeatitude s and
no cause fro~m without canl pofibly as felt
his uintrouble~d felicity. Among created
dependent beings, happiness flows in
sc~attered and feeble fiream~s; firearns
that are often tinged with the blacknef's
ofmife~r-y: ~-But from before the throne
of God ifixe~s the river of life, full, un-
mixed, and pure; and thre pleaitures
wvhich now in scanty portions we are
permitted to taste, are :all derived
frOM that source. WShateve~r gladdens

the hearts of rnen or angels, with any S ER M.
real and fatisfatory joy, comes from
heaven. It is a portion of the pukre in-
fluence fowleing fr~on the glory of thle
Almighty ; a ray ifuing from the bri~ghtnefi
of the ever~lafizg i~fe. It ~is manifeit,
therefore, that every approach to God
muit be an approach to felicity. The
enjoyment of his immediate pres~ence
muit be the cons~ummation of felicity.;
and it is to this presence that the PfalmiR
here expresses his hope that the pa-th of
life was to conduA him.

The whole of what is implied in ar-

riving at the presence of the Divinity,
we cannot exped to comprehend.. Such
expreflions as ther~eoffcripture, beh2olding

preflions altogether mysterious, convey-

moit perfea happii~ef's and higheit ex-
altation of human nature. Thkis we

know,

SER M. know, that the absence of God, the

VII dcJ cifiance at which we are now placed

from any communication with our Crea-
tor, is one great source of our infelicity.
Faith exerts its endeavours, but often
ineffectually, to rais~e our fouls to him.
He is a God that hideth himself. His ways
seem intricate and perplexed. We fre-
quently cannot reconcile them to the
conceptions which we had formed of his
nature s and with many a fuitpicion and
doubt they perplex the inquiring mirrd.
HKis works we survey with affonithment.
We wonder and adore. But while we
clearly trace the foottleps of their great
Author, his presence we can never dif-
cern. We go for~ward, bu~t be i· not there;

Surrrounded by such diffreffing ob~cd-·

opened to a good man, than that a period
is to come, wh~en he thall be allowed to
draw nearer to the Author ot his exist-
ence, and to enjoy the se~nse of his pre-
f'ence. In order to convey some faint
idea of that future bliss, boy s~uch an
image as we can now employ, let the
image be taken from the most glorious
representative of the supreme Being,
with which we are acquainted in this
world, the Sun in the heavens. As
that resplendent luminary chears and
revives the univers~e, when, after the
darknes~s of a tempestuous night, it
comes forth in the morning with its
brightest luffre, and inspires every heart
with gladness; as ascending gradually
through the heavens, it converts that

thus changes entirely the slate ofob-

and transforming it into the image of

of the Divine Essence to the blessed. _

God is htght. The revelation of his

presence, infers of course, a complete
diffufion of light and knowledge among
all who partake of that pres~ence. This
unqueffionably forms a primary ingredi-
ent of happiners. Ignorance, or the
want of light, is the source of all our
pres~ent mif~condult, and all our mnisfor-
tun-es. The heart of man is dark; and
in thme darknes~s of his heart is the f~eat·
of hiks corruption, He is unable to
discern what is truly good. Perpetu-
ally employed in search of happineirs, he
is perpetually misled by false appear-
ances of it. The errors of his under-
standing impose~ upon his paiffons;
and, in cons~equence of the wrong direc-
tion which his paffiolis take, he is be-
trayed into a thousand disorders. Hence
f~eni'uality, covetousn~ess, and all the vi-
01ent· contests with ~others about trifles,
which occasion fob much misery, and to
many crimes in the world.r Hefeedethl of

derived immediately from the Supreme
Being; pres~ently all his former errors
would fly away as milts are dispelled by
the rising f'un. H~is whole nature would
be changed and reformed. The pre-
judices which obscured his underfland-
ing would be removed. The fedudions
of his pafirons would disappear. Reai-
tude and virtue, having nothing now
to obitruat their entrance, would take
entire poffefflon of his heart. Angels
are happier than men, because they en-
joy more enlarged knowledge and

Moreover, the light that flows from

the presence of Him who is the original
source of light, not only baniihes mif'eries
which wTere the effeats of former dark-

he is conneaed with other beings.
Heaven implies a facietyr and the fe-

the perfeAion of love and goodnes~s,
flowing from the presence of the God
of love.

Hence follows the entire purification

of human nature from a~ll those malevo,-
lent pafirons, which have to long ren-
dered our abode on e~arth the abode of
mifrery. We greatly deceive ours~elves,
when we charge our chief diffreffes
merely to the account of our external
condition in the world. From the
dis~advantages attending it, I admit,
that we may often have been exposed

arrows of misfortune we may' have
been woundied. Under infirmities of
boady we may have languith·ed. But on
this we may depend, that the worlt evils
of our prefient condition arise from th~e
want of goodnes~S and love s from the
disorders of felfithn p~ations; from the
irritation which, there occasion when
working within ours~elves, and the di-
firefs which they produce when Ibreak-
ing out upon us from others; in a
word, from that corrupted slate of tem-
per, and that reciprocation ofjealoufies,
thxipicions, and injuries, which is ever
ta~king place among the societies of men.
Could you banish di~lruff, craft, and
uncharitablenes~s, from the earth, and
form all mankind into an assembly of
the juff and the benevolent a could you
ninfpire every heart with kind affeations,
and reader every one friendly and gene-

would be seen on every countenance.
Paradise would ret~urn. The wilderness
would f inile s the desert rejoice and Blofam
as the rofe.-Now fach are the effeets
which the presence of the God of love
mull produce on the inhabitants above.
BeholdingP his glory, they are changed into
th5e ame image. In that temple of eter-
nal-love, which his pres~ence has hallow-
ed and consecrated, no found but the
voice of harmony is ever heard; no ap-
pearances ever pref'ent themselves bu~t
those of peace, and joy.

THUs, considering God under ther~e

two illuffrious chatraders which are giv-
en of him in feripture, as Light, and as
L~ove, it follows that in his presence
t~here muit be fule/sof jo But Iam
far from saying that the few imperfea
hints I have now given, exhauit, or
even approach .to, ·the fum of those
pleasures for evermnore wheich are at God's
right hand. Ten thodiand pleasures

SE R M. are there, which now we have neither

fC~aculties to comprehend, nor powers
to enjoy. Behind that myfiterious cloud,
which covers the habitation of eternity,
the view of mortalts cannot penetrate.

situation, we muff as yet remain. Faith
can only look to thos~e glories from afar.

Supposing the ideas which I have se~t

before you, in this disc~ours~e, to be no
mnore than the [peculations of a contem-
plative mind, such as were wont of old
to be indulged by the ph~iloiophers of the
Platonic [chool, full they wousld deserve
attention, on account of their tendency
to purify and elevate the mind. But
when they are considered in connedlion
wvith a revelation, which, upon grounds
the most unque~ffionable, we believe to
be divine, they are entitled to com-
mnand, not attention only, butr reverence
and ~faith.--They prese~nt to us sauch
high expeftations as are fuffticient to
determine every~ reafonalble man to the

choice

Juitly may they excite in our hearts

God ; O zch1en F all I come aad appear
before himz!--But, with this with in our
hearts, never, I IBefeech you, let us for-
goet what was s~et forth in the firit part
of this discourse; that, in order to ar-
rive at the presence of' God, the path7 of

THESE words occurred in a confe, SER 19
1.rence which our Lord held with vrrr.

Simon Peter, after his ref~urreation from~ Lr
the dead. 'Conf~cious of the disgrace
which he had incurred by his late deni-
al of his Malter, Peter muA at this

thame. Our Lord, after a tacit re-

buke,

8 ER M.buke, implied in the queition which

great benignity, to his offiee as an apo-

thould be his lot to f~uffer dteath in the
cause of his ziaier. THhe apotle John,
diitinguilhed here by the denomination
of th5e di~cdle whom Jesus loved, being
present at this conversation, Peter, who
was always eager and forward, looking
to John, puts this queffion to our ·Savi-
our, Lord, 'and whafit }hall thiS man do ?
** What (hall be his employment ? what
(* his rank and Rtation in thy kingdtom ?
** what his future fate in Ilfe ?--By
what principle Peter was moved to put ·
this unseas~onable and improper queiti-
on to his Malter s, whether it arose from
mere curiosity, or from some emotion
of rivalthip and jealousy, does not ap-
pear I but it is plain that our Lord was
diffatisfied with the enquiry which he
made; and prefectly he checks Peter's
curiefity, by a severe reply 3 WhSat

is· th~at to thtee? '" What is it to thee S ER IMI.
*b what this man Feall do; what thlall be
dr his rank; or what the circu~m~fances
*e of his life or his death ? Attend thou
" to thine own duty. Mind thy proper
*C concerns. Fulfil the part w~hich I
' have allotted to thee. F~ol~low thou

m'ne." The iniarurStion which aris~es

from this conver~ttion of our Lord')s
with Peter, is, That all prying inquiries
into the itate, circumfianced, or charac-
ter of others, are reprehenfi'ble and im-
proper; that to every man a particular
charge is assigned by his Lord and Maf-
ter, the fulfillment of which ought to be
the primary object of his attention,
without officioufly thruffing himfielfin-
to the concerns of others. The illuflra-
tion of there points ihall make the s~ub-
je~t of the pref~eat difcourfie.

TH AT idle curiosity, that inquisitive

anrd meddling [pirit, which leads men to
pry into the affairs of their neighbours,
is repreheniible oix three accounts. It
interrupts the good order, and breaks

the

8 ER M. the peace of society. It brings forward

,,and nourithes several bad pafiron~s. It

draws men aside from a proper attenti-
on to the diicharge of their own duty.

Ir interrupts, I fay, the order, and

breaks the peace of fciety. In this
world we are linked together by many
ties. We are bound by duty, and we
are prompted by interest, to give mu-
tual afi~itance, and to perform friendly
offices to each other. But tho~e friend-
ly offices are performed to most advan-

Stage, when we avoid to interfere un-

neceifarily in the concerns of our neigh-
bour. Every man has his own part to
adt, has his own interest to cons~ult, has
affairs of his own to manage, which his
neighbour has no call to scrutinize.
Human life then proceeds in its most na-
tural. and orderly train, when every one
keeps within the bounds of his proper
province; when, as long as his pursuits
are fair and lawful, he is allowed, with-
out difitilrbance, to conduat them in his
own way. cybat ye judy to be quiePt, and

to do your ownrt bujinefs*, is the apoitoll- 8· ER M.
cal rule, and indeed the great rule, for Un.~f
preservati~on of harmony and order. But
to it is, that, iri eivery: age, a set of men
have exiited, who, driven by an urihappy
aaivity of fpiril, oftener perhaps than
by any fettled design of doing ill, or any
motives of ambition or initereiR, love t6
intermeddle where they have no coni
cern, to inquire into the private affairs
of others, andq from the imperfeA infor~
mation which they colled, to fornt
conclusions concernirig their circum-
itances and charaaer. There are they
who, in fekipture, are charadterif~ed as
tatlers, aznd busy bodies tin other mens mat"-
ters, and from whomi we are called to
turn awa.

Though persons of, this defeription

should be pr-ompted by nothing but vain
curiosity, they are, nevertheless, dange-
rous- troublers of the wiorld. W~hile
they conceive themfrelves to be inoffen-
five, they are sowing dissension and
Vet. IV. L" feuds.

*i r TheKr. iv. x 1.

SER f. feuds. Crof sing the: lities 'in which

otf~~j~hers move, they create confusion,
and awaken resentment. For every
man conceives himself to be inj~ured(,
wrhen he finds another~intruding into his
affairs, anid, without any title, taking
upon him to examine his conduet. Be-
ing improperly adnd unnecefferily diif-
turbed, he claims the right of diflurbing
·in his turn those: who wantorlly have.
troubled him. Hlence, many a friend-
thip· has been broken; the peace of ma-
ny a family has been overthrown> and
much bitter and lasting ditcord has
been propagated through faciety.

WHILE this spirit of meddling curi-

ofity injures to considerably the peace
and good order of the world, it also
nourithes, among individuals who are
arddieted to it, a multitude of bad paliT-
·ons. Its moss frequent source is mere
idlenef~is, whrich, in itself a vice, never
fails to engender mnany vices- more.
·The mind of man cannot· be long

inqjuiries into tht cohidu~t of their neig~h-
bours. The inquisitive and curious
are always talkative. What they learn,
·or fancy thems~elves to have learned,
concerning others, they are generally
in haste to diivulge. Ai tale which the
malicious have invented, and the cre-
dulous have propagated 3 a rumont
which, arising among the multitude,
and transmitted by one to another, has,
in every flep of its progrer~s, gained
fresh additions, becomes in~ the end the
foundation of confident assertion, and
of rath and severe judgment.

It is often by a s~pirit of jealouiy and

rivalry, that the res~earches of such per-
sons are prompted. They with to dif-
cover famething that will bring down
their neighbour's charaater, circum-
flances, or reputation, td the level of
their owni; or that· will flatter them
with an opinion of their own f~uperio-
rity. A s~ecret malignity lies at the
bottom of their inquiries.. It may be

sER IV. concealed by an' affeated ihow of oan-

I ,dour and impartiality. It may even be

veiled with the appearance of a friendly
concern for the intereits of others, and
with a~ffeAed apologies for their fail-
ings. But the hidden rancour is eafly
difcovered.--While, therefore, persons
of this defeription trouble the peace of
i'ociety, they at the fame time poison
their own minds with inalignant palli-
ons. Their difpolitio~n is entirely the
reverfre of that amiable spirit of charity,
on which our religion lays to great: a
Aref~s. Charity cover-ethQ the muclti~tude
o~ffns; but this prying and meddling
spirit seeks to diitcover and divulge
them. Charity thinzketh~l no evil; but
this temper inclines us always to fuipelt
the wrorkt. Charity rejceth nrot inz ini-
qruity; this temper triumphs in the dif-
covery of errors and failings. Charity,
like the fun, brightens every objea on

impertinent curiolity about the affairs -
of others tends greatly to obifrua per-
fonal reformation; as it draws mens
thoughts aside from what ought to be
the chief objeat of attention, the irix-
provement of their own heart and life.
They who are so officioudly occupied a-
bout their neighbours, havelittle leisure,
and les~s inclination, to obfrerve their
own defeas, or to mind their own duty.
From their inquisitive researches, they
find, or imagine they, find, in the be-
haviour of others, an apology for their
own failingos; And the favouri~te result
of their inquiries generally is, to reft
fTatisiied with thems~elves. They are a
least as good, they think,; as others
around them. The condemnation
which they pass on the vices of their
neighbours, t'hey interpret to be a fCenti-
ment of virtue in thems~elves. They
become those hypocrites deferibed by
our Lord, who fee clearly thde miore thar

SE 11 M. IN opposition to such a charader as

Sthis, the doarine plainly inculceage by

the text is, that to every man a parti-
cular charge is given by his Lord and
M~ast~er, a part is assigned him by Pro-
vidence to aa; that to this he ought tq
bend his chief attention s and, inficad
offeratinifing the charadter or slate of
others, ought to think of hims~elf, and
leave them to itand or fall by their own
master. What Jhall this mzan do? said
Peter. Whakt, replies our Lord,is~ that
teo th5ee? Foll'owr thOud me.

WHERE persons poffers any impoc-

tant flation, or. diftinguiihed rank, in
the world, the application of this doc-
terine to thpm is manifert. I'fthey hav~e
any candour, they cannot refus~e to ac-
knowledge~ that God and the world
have a title. to expedt from them a di-
ligent attention to their proper part in
life; and that to waffe their time in idle
inquiries about others, with whom they
have nothing to do, is reprehenfible' and
Finful.' But there are multitudes of
manfkind, to whom this appears in a very

(ff'erept

different light. They are humble and SER 3.
privagp men, who are willing~ to con-
ceive themselves as of little importance
In the wvorld. Having no extensive in,-
fluence, and no call, as they thinki, to
diftinguiih thems~elves by adive exer-
tions in any sphere, they imagine that
they may innocently lead an idle life,
and indulge their curiefity, by canvaflt-
ing at pleasure the charader and the
behaviour of thos~e around them, Wiithr
perso~ns of this deferption every society ·
too much abounds.clMy brethren, no
one ought to confxder himself as inig,-
nificant in the fight of God.

In our fTeveral Rtations we are all A~nt

fTorth to be labourers in God's vine ard.
Every man has his work allotted, his
talent committed to him; by the due
improvement of which he might, in one
~way or other, s~erve God, promote virr
tue, and be adeful in th~E world. OccuL-
py till I rcme, is the charge given to all
Chriifians without exception. To qbe

logative ofilo one, in any rank of life.

thade, there are a, variety of virtues to
be exercised, and of important d~uties to
be di-kharged. Much depends on them
·for the maintenance of private oecono-
my and order, for the education of the
young, and for the relief and comfort:
of thos~e whos~e funationsstengage them
in the toils of the world. Even where
nlo s~uch female duties occur to be per-
·formed, the care of preparing for future
ufefulnef~s, and of attaining sauch accom-
plifhments as procure just efleem, is
laudable. In s~uch duties and cares,
how far better is time employed, than
in that f'earch into private concerns,
that circulation of rumours, those dif~-
cufirons of the condue, and dlefeants on
the charader of others, which-engrofs
- conversation to much, and wh~ich end,
·for the most part, in [everity of centure !

faitable to thy charader and place 3 of

about others, is a fubtmation from that

THERE is, in particular, one great.

and compreheniive objea of attention,
which, in the text, is placed in dired
oppolition to that idle curiosity repre-
hended by our Lord; that is, to follow
Chris). Follow thoue me. What this
man or that man does; how he em-
ploys his t-ime s what uf'e he makes of
his talents; how he succeeds in the
world; are matters, concerning which
the information we receive can never
be of great importance to us; often,
is of no importance at all. But howp
opt Sayiour behayed while he was on

ear th,

SER M. earth,. or how, in our situation, hre

_,would have behaved, are matters of the
highest moment to every Christian.

'0he commandment given in the text,

to followze him, includes, both observance
of his words, and imitation of his exam-
ple. The words of Christ contain, as
we all know, the flanding rule of our
life. ~His example exhibits the great
model on which our condua ought to
be formed; and it is -to this that the
precept here delivered direAly refers.
--Examples have great influence on all.
But by all human examples, we are in
danger of being occasionally misled.
We are ever obliged to be on our guard,
left the admiration of what is eflimable,
betray us into a resemblance of what is
blemithed and faulty. For thne most
perfea human charaders, in the midit
of their brightness and beauty, are al-
ways marked with some of thiofe dark

But our Lord poffeffed all the virtues of
the greatest and belt men, without par-
taking any of their defeas. In him, all

WR~iS

was light without a thade, and beauty SER MI
without a flain.-Adt the fame time, his Vt
example is attended with this singular
advantage, of being more accommodat-
ed than any other to general imitation.
It was diflinguifhed by no unnatural
aufferites, no affeated singularities; but
exhibits the plain and simple tenor of all
those virtues for wrhich Iwe have most
frequent occasion in ordinary life. In
order to render it of molre essential be-
nefit, our Lord fixed his refiidence in no
particular place a he tied hims~elf down
to no particular calling or way of liv-
ing; but gives us the opportunity of
viewing his behaviour, in that variety
of lights which equally and indiffe-
rently regard all mankind. His life~
was divided between the retired and the
adf~ive slate. Devotion and buiinefs
equally shared it. In the diicharge of
that high office with which he was
veited, we behold the perfedt model of
a public charader s and we behold the
most beautiful example of private life,
when we contemplate him amfong his

dit~ciples,

S ER M. diieiples, as a Father in the midit of his

VI family.--By such means he has exhibit-

ed before as ipecimens of every kind of
virtue 3 anid to all ranks and clafres of
men has afforded a pattern after which
they may copy. Hardly is there any
e'mergency which cani occur in life, but
from some incident in our Savtiour's con-
dust, from fame feature displayed in his
charaaer, we are enabledto fay to our-
s~elves, ** Thus Christ would have ['po-
** ken, thus he would have adted, thius
'* he would have f~uffered, if he had
** been ci'rcumfianced as we are now."

Inficad, therefore, of thinking of

thy ·neighbours around thee, and~ of in-
,quiring how they behave, keep Christ
in thine eye, and in thy whole conduat
follow him. Followr him'n in his fleady
and confcientions' dfitcharge of duty,
amidit opposition from evil men, and a'
corrupted world. Follow him in his
patient f~ubmiiron to his Father's will,
and the calmness- of his spirit uilder
all trials,. Follow him in hiis ats~ of
diiinterefied benevolence, in his com-

passion

Ipamoln to the unhappy, in his readinef se SE M.
to oblige, to afifit, and to relieve. Imsi- VIn.
tate the mildneCs and gentleness of his L~
manners. Imitate the affabilit~y and
condefcention which appeared in his
behaviour. Imitate the uncorrupted
simplicity and perity which diflin-
guithed his whole life.

THESE are mulch worthier and no-

bler objeAs of your attention, than any
of those trifling varieties which you can
explore and disc~over in the charadters

ofthoe among whom you live. By

lifting yolir view to so high a flandard,
you will be preserved from des~cending
to thos~e futile and corrurpting employl
ments of thought, which occupy the
idle, the vain, and the malignant. It is·
incredible, how much time and atten,
tion are thrown away by men, in exa-
mmmig the affairs ofothers, and di~scuss-
ing. their condua. Were their time
and attention thrown away only, the
evil would, in some degree, be less. But
they are worre than thrown away; th~ey
are not merely fruitlets, but produaive

8 ER M~os much mischie~f. Such a hiabit of

'
f~, thought is conneated with a thousa8nd

vices. It is the conflant source of rash
and f'evere cent~ure. It arise~s from envy
and jealouijy. It foments ·ill nature and
pride. It propa~gates mifunderfianding
and dificord. All those evils would
be prevented, if the reproof which our
Lord administers in the text came ofte-

the following difcourfie.

I. OUR Saviour's words lead us to ob-

s~erve, that many things iix the condueA
of Providenrce are at pref~enit inyfterio~us
and unintelligible. The truth of this
obs~ervation will not be called in q~uit~ion.
It is indeed very readily admitted by all;
and ever since the beginning of the world
has been the foundation of many a com-
plaint, and of much feceptic~ifm concern-
ing the go~vernment of heaves.--That
human affairs are not left to roll on ac-
cording to ·mere chanee, and that Provi-
dence interposes is them to a certain de-·
gree, is made eviident by variouls tokens
to every candid mind. ·EBut the perplex4
ity aind trouble of the thoughtful iniqui-
r~et arises frornt bferving that Providence

appears

appears not to pursue any regular or con- S EIR M.
igjent plan. An unaccountable mixture
of light and darknefs~prefents itself to us,
when we attempt to trace the affairs of
the world up to any wife and righteous
administration. We fee juffice and order
begun; but on many occaiions they s~eem
to be des~erted. The ray of light which
we had traced· for a while, s~uddenly for-
fakes us; and, where we had looked for
the continuance of order, we meet with
confusion and difatppointment.-For in-
itance3 Fwhen we examine the confkitu-
tion of the 'human mind, we discern evi-
·dent marks of its being framedl with a
view to favoulrand rew~card: virtue. Con-:
s~cience is endowed wvith signal authori-
ty to check vice. It brings home un-,
easines~s and remorse to the bad; and it
fooths, and supports the righteous with
f~elf-approbation and peace. The ordi-
nary cour~e of human things is made to
coincide in some degree with this confli-
tution of our nature. The worthy and
the good are, in gearal, honoured and

All thi~s carries the impref's of a juit

Provide~nce, of a wife and a benevolent
adminifftrartion of the universe. We -can-
not avoid perceiving that the Almighty
hath fSet his throne ~for jurdgment. At
~the fame time, when we putfute our in-;
quiries, the Almighty appears to holda

ignorance as degrades them below the s E It M,
rli of rational beiqgs; or abandoned f
to be the prey of cruel oppreffon and
tyranny. WChen we lookr to the slate of
individuals around us, we hear the la-
mentations of the unhappy on every
hand. We meet with- weeping parents,
andmourninngfriends. We behold the
young cut off in the flower of their days,
and the aged left desolate in the midit of
sorrows. The useful and virtuous are
Swept away, and the worthlets left to
flourith. The lives of the belt men are
often filled with dif~couragements and
dis~appointed hopes. 1Merit languilhes
in negleaed iolitude s and vanity and
prefuxmption gain the admiration of the
world. From the fcouge of calumny,
and from the hand of violence, the inju-
red look up to God as the Avenger of
their cause i but often they Look up in
ynin. He is aGod that hideth Ma;fel
He: dwelleth, as to them, in the secret
place of darlsnef i or, if he dvyelleth in

light,

S E R light, it is in ijght to wrphickr no man cten

atJ p~prach. Resignation may feal up a~it
lips; but in silence they drop the tear,
and mourn while thley adore.

SUnH, it muff n-ot be dissembled, are

the difficulties which encounter us when
we attempt to trace the' present ways of
God. At the fame time, upon reflefion,
we may be satisfied that causes cari be
assigned for things appearing in this un-
favourable light; and that there is no
reason to be surprised at the divine con-
duatbeing myfierious -at present.

The monarchy of the universe is a

great and compicadted system. It com-
prehends numberlefs' getnerations of men,
who are brought fortli to aat their parts
for purposes unknown' to us. It includes
two worllds at once; the wLorld that now
is, and which is only a finall portion of
exiffence; and a' wo~rld that is to come,
w1hich exdures for eterniity. To us, no

.more than the ·begi~nnings of things are

vis ible. We fiee only some broken parts

of a great whole. We tra'e but afeW SER M.
Sli~is of that chain of ~being, which, IL
by secret conne~tions, binds together
the prefentand the future. Such know-
ledge is afforded us as is f~ufficient for
supplying the exigencies and wants of
our pres~ent slate s but it does no more.
Peeping abroad from a dark corner of the
univers~e, we attempt in vain to explore
the coulnfels that govern the world. It is
an attempt to fbund an unfathomable
deep with a scanty line s and with a fee-
ble wing to ascend above the Itars. In
any complicated work, even o ua
art, it is found necessary to be acquainted
with the design of the whole, in order to
judge of the fitners of its parts, In a
s~cheme to complex as the adminiffratio~n
of the world, where all the parts refer to
one another, and where what is seen is
often s~ubordinate to what is invisible,
how is it possible but our judgments
must be often erroneous, and our com-
plaints ill founded ? If a peas~ant or a-cot-
tager be incapable of judging of the go-

vernment

S ER Mv. vernment of a mighty empire, is it: fxr-,

IX. Sprifing that we thould be at 10fs con afn-

ing the casn nA of the Almighty to-
ward s his creatures? Wh.~at I dothouG knoto-~
~es not norw.

By T, on this argument itill more can

be said for our· fatisfaation. We are to
obs~erve, that complete information re-
[pieting the ways of God, not only was
not to be expeated here; but, mloreover,
that it would have been hurtful, if
granted to uxs in our present iiate. It
would have proved inconfiitent with
that Itate s with the adions which we
have to perform in it, and the duties we
have to fulfil. It would indeed have
overthrown the whole design of our
being placed in this world. ~We are
placedhere under the trial of our virtue.
Ignorance of the events that are ordained
to befal us, ignorance of the plans and
the decrees ofheaven, enter necessarily
into a iRate of tr~ial. In order to· exer-
cif~e both our intelleatual and moral
powers, and to carry them forward to

impirovement, wie rnutR be left to find SE IVJ.1M
our tay in the mindA of~ difficulties and X
dfoubts, ·of hardlhips, and f~ufferings.
We mud be taught to aB our part wiith
Conitaitly, thoug~h the reward of ouri
conitancy be diftiant. We thui learni
to brear wtith patience w~hatever ours
Creatjr- judges proper toI lay upon us,
though we` fee not the reason of the
h~ardships he inflid. If w~e wrere let
into the feeret of the wthole~ plan of Pro-
vidence; if the justice of Heav~en ·were,
in every Aep of its prcedlure, made ma-
nifeA to our view, mitih would no longer
be the creature he now is, nor would
his priefet Rtate answer ally purpose of

Myrrcery and darkiners, therefore, muit

of necefi~ty now take place in the course
Of things. Our pBrefat ate can be no
other than a iRate of twrilight or dawn,
where du~bius forms thaill often present
;themselv~es to us, and wjherews~e thall find
ourselves in a middle condition between
complete light and total darkness~. Had
we enjoyed no evidence of a juk Judge

ruling

S ER M.ruling the earth, and of his providence

I interposing in our affairs, virtue wp~uld

have been altogether deprived of its en-
couragement and support. Had the evi-
dence, on the other.hand, been to Atrong
as to place the hand of the Almighty
constantly before our eyes, the intention
of our pres~ent exiidence would have been
defeated, and no trial. of virtue have
remained. Ini~ead, therefore, ~of com-
plaining of the obscurity which at pre-
s~ent covers the condua of Providence,
we fee that, on the whole, we have
reason to f~ubmnit and adore.

II. THT~E text fuggeits that, _though

what God is doing, or what he intends to
do, we k~no~w not nowe, yet there is ground
to believe, that at some future period we
thall receive information. Wh~at I do
tho0u knowreZ .not nowre, buct thlou /J~aft know
hereafter. The queition here arises, what
that hzereafter is to which we are to look
for the s~olution of our priefea doubts ?

IN the f irA place, kereafter- may, on SER IVL.

some occasions, refer to the fubf~e uent ,Xx.
cours~e of events in this world. It often
happens that the consequences of things
throw light on the designs of God. The
hiff-ory ofProvidence, in proportion as it
advances, difembroils its~elf. Though our
pres~ent condition forbids extensive and
complete information, yet as much is
sometimes allowed to appear as gives us
favourable openings into the righteous
and benevolent counf'els of heaven.-
Thus, in the public affairs of the world,
it has been frequently seen, that from
the most unpromising caus~es important
and beneficent effeets have, in the fe-
quel, aris~en. In our own country, at
one period, the violen~t pafirons of a
prince gave beginning to the Reforma-
tion. At another period, arbitrary at-
tempts against religion and liberty occa-
£20n~ed that happy Revolution which has
formhed the ~Era of national prosperity.
In mnany initances, t~e Iwrathr of man has
been made to praise God. Those wars
and conunotions that thakre the roo-

unfolded in the end. The wheel wias

clock wa's advancing with unperceived
progrer~s, till the momenrt came of its
firiking the appointed hour.

In like manner, with ref~ped to indivi,-

duals, there is often a kpecrefte in the
course of their lives, which, difElofiee and
juffifies the ways of God, Not to mnlsn

he had se~en in what they had termina-

them, when led away by the Ifh3maeites
as a slave, or when thrown by Potiphar

and infiruators, is equally applicable to
us all under our present slate of educati-
on; Wh~rr~at I do, thoubt knrowefe not nowre, bult
thiou shalt knowe hereafter.--Re garding,
then, the unknowjn issue of all worldly
events in this life, let us never des~pair,
let us never think dithonourably of the

Both are marked with the fame cha-

both, it is evidently the intention of the
first Author not. to render every thing
level to our capacity; but in the inidfi
of high design and order, to allow cer-
tain objeAs to appear, which contradid2

& man; as a itate of perpetuail con~raint,

formed by a iyriem of severe rules,
which designing men have pontrived to
impose as fetters on the multitude. On
the other hand, they paint a licentious
course to themse~lves, and hold it out to
the world, as the gay and pleas~urable
enjoyment of life; where, having fur-
mounted the prejudices of educationl,
and the timorous ifcruples of conscience,
men -can think and sa at pleafixre, and
give full scope to every with of the
heart.--But what if those~ pretended
sons off freedom be thems~elves held in
miierable fuzbjeeaion, apd their boaais of
liberty be no more thap the fwielelzing
wreords of~ zanityr The Apost~le asserts
ip the text, that while they pr~o~mire /li
ber-ty to others, they are th·e/ervlants, or
slaves, of corruption, overcome, land
brought into bonrdage by it. This after-
tion of the Apostle I purpose to illu-
Atrate. I thall endeavour to make it
appear, that no true liberty can ariife
from vice s that bad men undergo the

worA

worli servitude s and that no one 8ER M.
is free, but he who is virtuous and ~~
good.

IT is necessary to begin with remov-

ing false ideas of liberty, and thewing
in what it truly consists. We are not
to imagine that to be free imports our
;being f'et loos~e from restraint or rule of
every kind. No man, in any conditi-
on of life, is at liberty to aft always as
he pleas~es, and to gratify every with he
forms. The nature of the human state
neceffariljr impos~es on all men various
restraints. The laws of society allow
no one to indulge himself in purs~uits or
pleasures that are injurious to his neigh-
bour. Even our own nature limits
our pleas~ures within certain bounds.
All our desires cannot be gratified toge-
ther. They frequently interfere, and re-
quire him who would indulge one fa-,
yourite passion, to deny himself in
another. Diftin~tions, therefore, muff
be made, preferences be given, and
some general regulation of condult be
observed by every one who consults his

OWHl

s eR M. own we~lfare. If there be any regula-

1 Ltion which ensures us of safety and hap-

pinef~s, to be disengaged from the obfer-
vance of that regulation is no article of
liberty; at least offuch liberty as a wifia
rnan would with to enjoy. It is in
ef3Fea to be turned ~loose to our own
ruin. It is furch liberty as a blind man
enjoys, of wandering at random, and
firikingr into every devious path, with-
out a guide to direA his fieps, and save
himr from deftrua~tion.

That urnbounded licentiouf~ne~s,' there.

fore, wl ich sinners prefer to ever-y re-
grulation ofcondua, is altogether diffe-
rent fromn.true freedom. It is in moral~
behaviour the f~ame as anarchy is in a
Itat~e, w~here law and order are extini~t.
Anarchy, firrrely, iS no les~s incompati-
ble with true lib~erty than abiolute -def-
potifmn; and of the two it is hard to fay
which is the least eligible, or the most
uniferable slate. Liberty by at mean~s
Enppofes thre ablrence of all gove'rnment.
It only ~fupofes that the govern-·
anent under which we are placed is..
w-ife; anrd tha~t the reitraints to

, ' which

which we voluntarily su~bmit ourselv~es s E M ~.
have been contrived for the general X,
in terest.

Tob~efree, fherefore, imports, inge-

neral, ·our being placed in fach ci~lcarcu-
itances, that within the bound~s of ju-
slice and good order, wye can aa ac-
~cOrding to our own~ del~iberate choce,
and take such measu~res for our condua
as we have r eafon to believe are c~ondu-
cive, to our welfare; without being
obitradted either ·by external force, or
by violent interna"l impuls~e. This is
that happy :and dignifie~d slate which
every wife man earnefily withes to en-
joy. The advanta-ges which result fsrom
it are chiedly there three; freed~om of
choice I independen ce of mind ; hold-
nes~s and security. In opposition to
there diftingui-lhing charad~ers of liber-
ty, I now proceed to thew that, in the
firit place, vice deprives bad men of
free choice in their adions; that, in
the recond place, it brings them an-
der a flavilh dependence on external
circaditances I and that, in the third
platce, it reduces them to that abjea,

cowardly,

S ER M. cowardly, and difquieted itate which id

^-1essentially charaderiitic of bondage.

I. VICE is inconfidient with liberty,

as it deprives sinners of the power of
free choice, by bringing them under
the dominion of passions and habits.
Religion and virtue address themselves
to reason. They call us to look round
on every fide s to think well of the con-
s~equences of our adtions 3 and, before
we take any Rtep of importance, to
compare the good with the evil that
may ensue from it. He therefore who
follows their didtates, aas the part of a
man who freely consults, and chuies,
for his own intereit. But vice can
make no pretenflons of this kind. It
awaits not the tell of deliberate compa-
rifon and choice ; but overpowers us at
once by fame itriking impression of
pres~ent advantage or enjoyment. It
hurries us with the violence ofpafflon;
captivates us by the allurements of plea-
sure ; or da zeles us by the glare of riches.
The finner yields to the impuls~e, merely

- becrufce

hecadfe he cannot refiA it, Reason re- S ER M.
mon~rates; conscience endeavours to X
check him; but all in vain. Having
once allowred some itrong pafiion to
gain the ascendant, he has thrown him-
s~elf into the middle of a torrent, against
which he may sometimes faintly itrug-
gle, but the impetuosity of the firearn
bears him along. In this situation he
is to far from being free, that he is not
master of himself. He does not go,
but is driven; tossed, agitated, and im-
pelled; pailive, like a~fhip to the vio-
lence of the waves.

After pafflon has for a while exercif~

ed its tyrannical fwvay, its vehemence
may by degrees subside. But when by
long indulgence, it has eitabliih~ed ha-
bits of gratification, the finner's bon-
dage becomes then more confirmed, and
more miserable. For during the heat
of pursuit he is little capable of reflec-
tion. But, when his ardour is abated,
and nevertheless, a vitious habit root-
ed, he has full leifore to perceive the
heavy yoke he has brought upon him-
self. How many slaves do we fee inth

furre, but because abstinence would give
them pain.; and this too,- even when
they are obligoed at last to conderux

Vice confirms its dominion, and ex-

tends it Rtill fa~rther ·over the foul,, by
compelling the fisner to support one
crime by means of another. Not only
is he enslaved to there vices which take
their rife from his- own inclination, but
they render others necessary, to which,
againdt his inclination, he muit sub;;

gards hi's s~uperiors with proper defe--

III. AN OTHER CharaterA Of the

slavery of vice, is that mean, cowardly,
and difquieted slate, to which it redu-
ces the finner. Boldness and matgnani-
mity have ever b~een accoynted the na-
th~e effeass oflibierty. He who enjoys
it, having nothing to applrehend from
opp~reflive power, performs the offices,
and enjoy~s the comforts of life, with a
manly and undiflurbed mind. *Hence.
his behaviour is dignified, and his fen-
timents are honourable a while he who
is accuffomed to bend under, servile
[~ubjea5ion, has always been found
mean-fpirited, timorous, and base.---

ous and the vicious man, and you will

and in the discharge of his duty, fears

eye -of inte~grity; i~s ever looking around
him with anxiouls and fearful circumf~pecr
tion, and thinking of subterfuges, by
which he may eieape from danger. The

is formed to inspire.

Corres~ponding to that abjeA difpoli-

tion which charad~terifes a bad man, are
the fears that haunt him., The terrors of
a slave dwell on his mind, and often
appear in his behairiouir. For guilt is
never free from utipicion and alarm.
The finner is afr~aid, fb~metimes, of the
partners of his crimes, leit they betray
him; famr~et:~imes of those wh6 hlave sus-
fered by his crimes, leit they revenge
themselves; frequen;tly, of the world
around hinrl leit it: deted him; and
what is wore of; all, he is re'duced to
be afraid of himself. There is a wit-
ness within him that teitifies ag~ainst his
mildeeds; and threatens him in frecret,
when other larnms leave ·himn. Con-
ecience holds sp to his view the image of
his past crimes, with this infeription ch-
:grabed upon it; ** Gdd willr brinig evlery

(utch a Rate as this; to the peacefuil fecu.
t·ity arising from the liberty enjoyed by

the

the virtuous ? --Were there nothing S·ER M.
more in the circumitances of sinners to x.X
affix utpon them the marks offervitudie,
·this alone would be ~ifulicient, that, as
the [ccripture expresses it, throucgh fear
.ofdea~th they are all their lI~j~feime fubjett
to bondage*. Death sets all other cap-
tives fr~ee. The slave who digs in the
mine, or labours at the oar, can rejoice
in the profpeat of laying· down his bur-
den together with his life; and tastes
the hope of being at laif on equal terms
with his cruel oppressor. But to the
slave of guilt there arises no hope from
.death. On the contrary, he is obliged
to look forward with conflant terror
to this mos 1 certain of all events, as
the conclusion of all his hopes and the
commencement of his greatest miseries.

I HA VE: thus set before you such

clear and unequivocal marks of the s~er-

vitude

SHeb. ii. I5*

SER IV. vitude ulndergone;8 by kners, as·'fully

~x.c verify the affetion in thie text, that a

slate of vice and corruption is a fisate ·of
bondlag~e. In order taIperceive how- fj-
vere a bondage it is, let us ·attend to
[ome peculiar circumitf kace-s o a~gra-va-
tion which belong ·to it.

Firit, It is a bondage to which- the

mind itfelff, the native feat of ibert~y, is
fubje~ted. In other cafes, a ·brave mian
can comfort himfel~fwith ref lettinig that,
let tyrants do their worA, let prisons or
fetters ·be his lot,_ his miind remains un-
conquered and free. Of this liberty they
cannot rob~ him; her~e h-e moves in al
higher sphere abiove the reach of .op-
p~remion or confinement. But what ·avails
the (how of external ~liberty, to one vho
has loft the government of hims~elf ? As
·our Saviour reasons, in another cafe, If
the ~aght that~ is in thee be ''darknefps, powr
greakt its that darknef-s' ? So we may 'rea-
son here, if that part of thy nature, thyl
mind, thy ·will, by which only thou
canst enjioy and reliih liber ty, be ittelf

i~n bondage to evil pailions and habits, sE R M.
how miserable must be that bondage ? X.

Neyt, It is aggravated by this confi-

Feration, that it is a bondage which we
have brought upon ourfolves. To have
been forced into slavery, is misfortune
and mis~ery, Bult tohave renounced our
liberty and chosen to be slaves, is the
greatest reproach added to the greateif
misery. Moments there frequentlymuff
be, when a finner is frenfible of the de-
gradation of his itate s when he f~eels
ivith pain the flavilh dependence under
which he is 14rought to ~fortune and the
world, to violent passions and f~ettled
habits, and to fears and apprehenflons
ariiing from conscious guilt. In such
anoments, how cruel is the refleation,
that of all this dis~grace and mis~ery he
has been the author to himself; that by
voluntary compliance, he has given to
his passions that haughty ascendant
which they now ~exercise over him ; has
forged thie chains with which he is
bopund i and fold,hinifelf to do iniquity !

La itly,

4 ER M. Laffly, . The servitude of vice is ac-

Scompanied with this farthrer aggravatiz

on, that it is fubjeaion to ouLir own ferz
vants. There~ desires and pafflons, which
the finner has raised to lawle~s' rule, ;were
given us as instruments offelf-pre~e~rva-
tion; but were plainly designed to beun-
der the direation of a higher power. Of
themfielves, they are headitrong and
blind ; they bear all the marks' of in-
tended fabordination s and conscience is
invested writha every enlign of authority
and fiupremiacy. But fin inverts the
whole frame of human nature. It com-
pels reason to bow down before those
passions which it was formed to com-
mand; and leads it, as it were in tri-
umph, to grace the shameful conquest of
i~ts miniffers and servants. It has been,
alwrays observed that none are to insolent
in power, as they who have ufurfIed an
authorityi to whlichi they had no right s
and to it is found to hold in this irfftance.
SThe desires snd pafilions o-fa vitiou-s man,
having once obtamned an unlimited Away~,
tram-ple him under their feet, They

make

rmake him feel that heis fubjea to divers, S ER M.
and contradiaory as well as im erious, _
makters, wvho often pull him different
ways. His foull is residered the recep-
tacle of many repugnant and jarring dif-
politions; and resembles some barbar'-
ous country, cantoned out into different
principalities, who are continually wag-
ing war on one another. Such is the
itate into which sinners have brought
themselves, in order to be free from the
s~upposed confinement of virtue. Where
they had promised therinieves nothing
but ease, and pleasure, they are made to
experience reitraints more severe, and
mortifications more painful, than any
which they would have undergone un-
der the discipline of religion.

It will perhaps be contended by some,

that although the representation which
has now been given of the slavery of fms;
holds true in certain initances, yet that
it is applicable only to those who. come·
under the defecriptio4of·atr~ocious fnners.
They imagine that a certain moderate
curs~e may be held in *vice, by means of

which,

8 ERM. Which, men, without throwing altos

x.
X ether aside the reitraints ofreafon, ma

enjoy an easy and pleafaurable life.l--
By reasoning thus, my friends, you flat;
ter and deceive yours~elves to your own
deithuaion. Be assured, that, by every
vitious indulgence, you are making an
approach to a slate of complete slavery ;
you are forfeiting a certain (hare of your
liberty ; how soon the whole of it may
be forfeited, you are not aware. It is
true that all which h~as now been said of
the s~ervitude offin, applies only to a
charadter corrupted in thie extreme. But,
remember that to this extreme no ·mani
ever arri~ves at once. He paires thr~ough
many of those intermediate flages,'in one
of which you are now perhaps found.
Vice always creeps by degrees; and in;
fenihbly twines around us thiofe conceal;

an inward principle of goodnes~s, is be-
yond disp~ute, an that its value and effi~
cacy are derived from its effeas in puri-
fy~ing the heart, and re~forming the life.

All

All external services, which have not SER M.
this tendency, are entirely insignificant. ,X_
They degenerate into mere fuperitition,
equally unacceptable to God, and un-
profita~ble to man. Hence they are so
often treated ir i Aripture with high con-
tempt, when fubitituted in the room of
the important duties of a virtuous life.

Notwithitanding this, it is certain that

external services have their own place,
and a considerable one too, in the iyfiem
of religion. What their proper place is
no one can be at a loss to dikcern, who
will only make a juff difidtiion be-
tween the means, and the end, in reli-
gion. It is evident there is danger of
men's erring here, ·either on one fide or
other s and it is certain that they have
erred.0n both. After it was observed,
that mnankind were prone to lay too
much weight on the external parts of
religion, it began to be thought, that
no .weig~ht was to be allowed to them

of the public worthip of God, and the

fider it in three lights; as it ref~peas God i

the Creat~orof the world, no consequence
appears inore natural and diredt than this,
that he ought to be worihipped byi his
creatures, with every outward exprefflon
of fubmbiiTonand honour. W~e need only
appealto every man's heart, whether this
be not a principle which carries along,
with it its own obligation, that to ]Hirn
wiho is thie Fountain of our 'life, and t~he
Fathier' of our miercies; to Him who has
rais~ed up thaL~t lbealutifh· ituur~t e of the

SER M. ments of gratitude thould be made,

XI. - Ipraifes and prayers thould be offered,

and all fauitable marks of dependence on
him be expreffed.---This obligation ex-
tends beyond the silent and secret fe~n-
timents of our hearts. Besides private
devotion, it naturally leads to associations
for public worthip; to open and declared
prolfeflions of refped ~for the Deity .
'Where blefr~ngs are received in tom-
mkon, an obligation lies upon the com-
munity, jointly to acknowledge them.
Sincere gratitude is always of open and
d~iffufive nature It loves to pour itself
forth; to give free vent to its emotions;
aind, before the world, to acknowledge
and honout a Benlefaaor;.

So cons~onant is this to the natural ~enl-

timnents of mankind, thiat all the nrat~ions
oif the earth have, as with one consent,
it greed to infitiute some forms of worthip;
to hold meetings, at certain times, in hoi
nour of their deities. Survey the focie-
ties of men in their rudest slate s explore
t~he Africtiri defarts, the wilds of Amei-ica:,

cr the diitant islands of the ocean: and E R M.
you will find that over all the earth iome c
religious ceremonies have obtained. You
will every where trace, in one form or
other, the temnple, the priett, and the
offering. The prevalence of the most
abifurd f~uperfl-itions furnifhess this tefti-
mony to the truth, that in thle hearts of
all men the principle is engraved, of
worthnIP being due to that inviiible Pow-
er whio rules th~e world. -Herein con-
sifts the great excellency of Christ~ian
religion, that it hath infiiruaed us in the
Elmple and sp~iritual nature of that wore
thip. Difencumbered of idle: and un-,
meamang ceremonies, its ritual is pure,
and worthy of a divine Author. Its
positive inflitutions are few in number,
moffc significant of spiritual things, and
direatly conducive to good life and prac-3
tice. How inexculable then are we, if,
placed in such happy circumstances, the
sense of those obligations to the public
wo~rlhip of God thall be obliterated
amngg us, which the light of n~iture

The refinements of false philoso~phy

have indeed f~uggefied this th~adow of ob-
je~tion, that God is too great to fland in
needof any eternal service from his crea-
tures s that our expressions of praise and
honour are misplaced with refpea to him,
who is above all honour and all praise;
that in his fight the homage we seek to
pay must appear contemptible; and is
uherefore in itifelf superfluous and tris-
ling.·-- But who hath thought tholre
vain reafobners, that all exprefilons of
gratitude and honour towards a: superior
become uns~uitable, merely becaus~e that
superior needs not any returns ? Were
they ever indebted to one whose favours
they had it not in their power to repayi
and, did they, on that account, feel
thems~elves set loose from every obl~iga-
tion to acknowledge, and to prais~e
their benefaaor ? On the contraryt
t-he more~ diiintereflied his beneficence
was, did not gratitude, in anjai~n-
genuous mind, burn with the greater-

ardour,~

ardour, and prompt them the more s 4 Ivt.
eagerly to feiize every opportunity of, ,
publicly teitifying the feelings of their
hearts 3--Almighty G~od, it is true, is
too great to need our service or homage.
But he is also too good not to accept it,
when it is the native expreflion of a
grateful and generous mind., if pride
and fe~lf-f~ufficiency Rifle all f~entimnents
of dependance on our Creator s if levityr,
and attachment to worldly pleafurers,
render us totally peg-leaful of expressing
our thankfulness to Him for his blessings i
clo we not hereby diicover such a want
of proper feeling, fach a degree of hard-
nes~s and corruption in o'ur affeaions, as
ihows us to be immoral and unworthy;
and muff juffly expos~e us to the high

according to every notion which we can
form of the Father of the univers~e, mufa
it not be acceptable to him to behold

II. CONSIDER its impor~tance in an-

other view, as it refpeas the world.
W~hen we su~rvey the general slate of
mnankind, we find them continually im-
merfed in worldly afFairs; bufietd about
·providing tly ne~cessaries of life, occupied
in the pursuits of·:their pleas~ures, or
Pagerly pros~ecuting- thA~ advancemen~t

oftheir interests. In such al ituation of8 ER M.
things, a iimall rmeaf~ure of reflexion xI.
might cohvince any one, that without
some returns of sacred days, and foine
solemn calls to public worhipi, it were
impofiTble to preserve in the world any
sense of objefts, to foreign to the gene-
ral current of thought as an inzvifible
Governor, and a future slate. If it
be of importance to th~e peace and good
order of society, that there thould prevail
among ~men the belief of One in the hea-
vens, who is the prote~t'or of righteous-.
nes~s and the avenger of crimes; if it be
of importance that they be taught to
look forwYard to a day of judgment, when
they are to be brought to account for
their most secret gaions, and eternally
rewarded or punished, according as their
·conduA has been good or evil; if such
prinexples as there,? I f'ay, be of conf~e-
quence to the public welfare, they cer-
taitily enforce the authority of public
worthip, and prove the necessity ofreli-
grous infiruction.

I1 ifpeak

S ER M. I [peak now particularly with a view

jtLto the multitude, the great mas~s and

body of the people. We all know,
how seldom from education, or private
infiruaion, they have the advantage of
deriving s~entiments of religion~ or mora-
lity. Early obliged to labour for their
bread, they would remain all their days
in gross ignorance of every moral or
sacred principle, were it not for those~
public assembli~es in which they hear of
God, and Christ, and judgment, and
heaven and hell. Shut up tholfe temples
to which they resort with reverence;
exclude thep2 from the' opportunities
they now poffefis of receiving religious
infirut=ion, and imbibing religious ideas;
and what can you expedf them to be-
come ? no other tkan a ferocious rabble,
who sect free from checks of conflcience,
and fears of divine vengeance, would be
prone to every outrrage which they 4·ould
commit with impunity. It is well
known that, in the early ages of the
world, sages and legislators who endea-.
vpured tp tame and to a~fociate the bar.

barou&

barous hordes of men, found it necefa~ry S ER Mv.
for this purpore, to have recourse to re- i
ligion. By bringing the rude multitudes
to worship together, and at slated times
and-places, to join in hymns and fougs
to their deities, they gradually reitrained
them from violence, and traiqed them to
subordination and civilized life.

During the progres~s of society in after:

periods, religiqus assemblies at church
continue, I am persu~aded, to have a very
considerable influence on the civilization
and'improvement of the people. Even
independent of effed upon their moral
principles, by leading numbers of them
to meet togethler in an orderly way, and
in their most decent appearance, they
tend to humanize and polish their man-
ners. They firenghten the fociail con-
neflions, and promote friendly inter-
course among thof'e who are in th~e f~ame
neighbourhood, and in the f~ame lines
of life. It muff at the fiame time,
be agreeable to every humane mind to
think, that one day in s~even is allotted
for reft to the poor frosts their daily la-

bours,

SE R M. bours, and for such enjoyments of ease

xi. and comfort as their flation affords.

.It is the only day which gives them oc-
-cafion .to· feel -themselves ·as belonginS
to the fame class of being~s with their fu~-
periors; when joining with them in the
fadme aas of worthip, and recognizing
a common Lord. Amidrft those dif-
tinations which the d~iffAer-ence of rank~s
necessarily introduces into human foi-
clety, it is surely fit that there be some
occallons when man can meet with man
as a brother, in order that the pride of

Sthe great may be checked; and the low

may be taught that, if they dis~charge pro-
perly their appointed part, they have
reason to expeat, from the Lord of the
universe, the fame rewards with the rich
and the mighty.

It will, I believe, be generallty admit-

ted that forms of public worthip, and
means ofreligious infirudion, are impor·-
tant, on feveralaccounts, for the body of
the people, and -belong to the mainte-
nance of public f'afety and order. B~ut
many who~1 admit this are apt to think,

that to the commodn people alone theyi SE IVI .
may be left. To perions of liberal xI.
education and enlalrged minds, what
benef it can arise from hearing what they
already know; and what, perhaps, is to
be inculca~ted on them by those whor are
of inferior capacity to themselves ?---
Admitting this plea of s~uperiority whiich
their vanity formns, and set~ting aside for'
the present any perfbna1 obligation they
are under to worthip God, I muit- alk
fulch persons, how they canl expeA that
religious assemblies· will be long ref-
peAed by the lower ranks of men, if by
men of rank and education they are dif-
countenanced and fori'aken?~ Do not'
they know, that those~ lower ranks are
ready to copy the manners, and to follow
the example of their s~uperiors in all
things; but affuredlyy *in nothing more i
than in what appears to f'et thend; free
from reffraint, and to gratify licentionf`-
ne's ? While they acknowledge the imn-
portance, -and even the inecefi~ty, of pub-
lic rehigion to certain classes of men, do
they, neverthelets, contribute by their

behaviour

s eR M. behaviour to defeat the end of pulbl~ic
,xt. reli ' n, and to annihilate thalt impor-

tance which they aicribte. to it?---
They are employed in framing laws and
statutes for preventing crimes, and keep-
ing the disorderly multitude whithin
bounds; and at the f~ame time, by per;
fonally difcountenancing public wor-
thip, they are weakening, they are everi
abolishing, among the multitude, that
moral restraint, which is of more gene-
ral influence ·upon manners than all
the laws they frame. In vain they com-
plain of the diihoneity of fervtants, of the
infiolence off mobs, of the att~ackis of the
highwayman. Toa all there disorders
they have themselves been acceffrory.
By their open djiregard of sacred inflitu-
tions, they have disseminated: prolffiacy
among the people. They have broke6
down the floodgates which served to
re~train the torrent s they have let it
loose to overflow the land; snd1c by the
growing deluge may themselves be
iiwept away.-Bust I mait next argue
upon a different grofund;r ad proceed.

IIIl. To

HrI. To set f~orth the importance oss E R M.

the public wort~hip of God to every mn-
dividual, in every rank of life. What-
ever his flation be, he is Ril a ~man;
and has the duties of a man to perform.
Were his attendance on divine worthip
of no other effet, than to add· co-unte-
nance to a salutary inflitution, this alone
would render it his duty. But more-
over, we assert it to be his duty on his
own account; if it be the duty of every
man to are the proper means of prefer-
vin~g and fortifying his virtue. All the
Chiriftian infliitutions have a direat ten-
·dency to this end. They all serve to
give warmth to piety, and to add folem-
nity to moral virtue. A very high opi-
nion, indeed, that man muff have of his
o~wn charader, who imagines that,
amidit all the follies and corruptions of
the world, hie flands in need of no affif-
tance' for enabling him to a~t his part
with propriety and dignity.

The queff~ion is· not, whether perfonb

of ~rank and education are to learn any
thing that is new to them, by frequentingo

the

8 ER M. the places of public worship. The

great principles of piety and morality

ihall readily admit, that there are many
to whom no ne w infiruation is commu-
nicated, in the house of God. But, my
friends, the purpose of your going there
is to have known truths recalled to your
mind, and their dormant influence
awakened; is to have s~erious meditations
s~ugg-ested 3 to have good dif'politions
taifed; to have the heart adjuffed to a
compos~ed and tranquil frame. Is there
any man o~f reason and refiedion, who
will not acknowledge ifuch effeats, as
far as thley follow from attendance oi> re-
ligious ordinanlces, to be of the most be-
neficial nature? These~ occasional ceffa-
t~ions from the cares and anxieties of life,
therfe interruptions to the bufth; and the
pamrons of the world, iis order to thinki
and hear of eternity, are bothi areliefand
an improvement to the mind. By this re-
treat from its ordinary circle o~fthoughts,
it is enabled to return, with more clearness

and

13ut after all that has been urgedl oni

this fubjea, I ain fe~nfble it may be
objeAed, that mariy who make conf~ci-
ence of paying firia regard to the infH-
tutions of religion, do n'ot appear to
have derived muich benefit from thiem.
They are not, it will be said, more im-
p roved in triokal cond~ita, and in the
proper dif'charge of thie se~veral duties of
life, than others whio hav~e been appa-
j-ently negligent of the s~ervices of the

gardf

*k Eccles. ii. -8.

gard to thiere appears to be iubitituted SE R M
b~y many;, in the room of the weightier X,
matters of the law. ;~-Though this
ihorldd be admitted, it goes no farther
than to thew that humcan weakneirs, or
corruption, may defeat the purpose of
the most promiliing means of moral· im-
prove'ment. That a fiuperflitious at-
tention to external worthip, has too of-
ten us~urped the charafter, and thp~plant-
ed the place of real virtue, wvill not be
denied. .Admonitions against ~o dange-
rous an error cannot be given too often.
But- because the best things have bjeen
often misapplied and abuted, no argu-
ment thence aris~es for their being under.
valued, and th~rown aside. So als~o rea-
son, 'infiru~ion, and discipline of every
kind, have been frequently perverted to
bad ends; and yet their intrinsic worth
and d~efulnefs remain untouched and ac-
knowledged.--Befides this, itcannothe
admitted that, becad~ie religious infittu-
tions produce not all the good that might
be withod, and hoped for, they therefore
do no good at all. This were a rath and

Q 2 ill-

SE ItM.ill-fodinded conclufiion. If the moras of

,Xfjmen are'not always amended by them asr

they ought to have been, thiere is .rea-
son, however, to think that they would
have been wadre without th~em. Some
check is always givlen by them to open
profligacy. Some afflitanceis furnith-
ed to good difpolitions rs heart 3 at least,
to decency of manners. Even mome~n-
tary imprdeions of feriodfneifs made on
the thoughtless by the folemnities of re-
ligion, are not withou't their fruit. They
leave generally some trace behind them ;
and when the traces are often renewed,
they may be hoped, througlh the divine
blefiing, to form at hit a deep impref-
sion onI the mind.

At the fame time, I do not f~ay that re-

ligious inflitutions work. upon the mind
like a charm; and that mere bodily at-
tendance on them will always enthlre as
of fame profitable effe~t. Let the means
that are employed, for the improvement
of rational beinrgs, be ever to powerful in
themselves, much of their fuctefs wi~l
always depend on the manner in which

they

they are recei.ed and applied. I thall s ydivJ
:therefore conclude my rt obnings on this 4f
[abjeat, with a few observations con-.
cerning the difpolitions reqttilite on our
part, fbr deriving benefit front the pub-.
-lic ordinances of religion.

TH E endsfor which we affemblein the

house of God are two; to worthip God,
and to liffen to religious initruations.

-and mos 6 sacred purpose of every religi-

and afterwards made to th~ine with fair-

the gofperl in Jesus Christ. Its bright-
ness mady sometimes be fironger, and
fometimnes weaker, according to the me-
diums by which it is conveyed. `But
£till, as far as the infiructions delivered
from the pulpjit are illuminated by the ray

and ought to be received as such.· Re-

S ER M. r-I O u/e this; w~orld o as not to abus~e it,

L~.J1 is one of the most important, and at

th~e f~ame~ time one of the most difficult
letfons which religion teaches. By to
tnany desires and passions we are con-
ne~ted with the objeats around us, that
our attachment to them is always in ha-
rard of becoming exce~ffve and sinful.
hence religion is often employed in me-
dera~ting this attachrneslt, by redtifyling

our erroneous opinions, and infirnaing E R M.
us in the proper value we ought to set f
on worldly things, Such wa~sparticu-
larly the scope of the Apottle in this con-
text. He is putting the Corinthians in
mind that their tzime li Fort s that every
thing here is transitory : and therefore,
that in all the different occupations of
human life, in 2eeeping and rejoiczing, and
bucying and pofeffn, they were ever to
keep in view this considera~tion, that th5e
fafhizn of this world paft~~eth awa T he
original exprefiion iniports, the figure
or form under which the world presents
itself to us.- The meaning is, All that
belongs to this viiible slate is continually
changing. Nothing in human affairs is
fixed or flable. All is in motion: and
fluenation s altering its appearance
everymoment andpaflinginto some new
form. Let us meditate for a little on the
feriouis view which is here given us of
the world, in order that we may attend·
to the improvements which it fuggeits.

Let us only· think of the changes

iwhich our own ideas and opinions- un-
dergo in the progres~s o~flife. Ore mana
differ~s not more from another, than the
i fme man varies fromn himfrelf in diffe-
rent periods of his ages and iin different
situations of fortune. In youth, and in
opulence, every thing ~appears smiling
asnd gay. We fly as on the wings of
fancy; and survey beauties wherever
we cast our eye. But let some more
years have passed over out- hea~ds, or let
difaippointments in ~the world haver de-
pressed our spirits; and what a change
takes place ? The pleasing illutions that
once shone befo~re us; the splendid fa-
brics that imagination had reared; the
enchanting maze in which we once
wandered with.delight, all vanith and
are forgotten. The world itself remains
the fame. But its form, its appearance,
and' alpe61 is changed to our view s its
fahion, as to us, hath pafe~d awa]Ly.

are thus changing within, the conditi- xuI.
on of all external things is, at the fame
time, ever changing without us, and
around us. Wherever we caitour eyes
over the face of nature, or the mgnu-
ments of art, we discern the marks of
alteration and vicifirtude. We cannot
travel far upon the earth, without being
presented with many a itriking memo-
rial of the changes made by time. What
was once a flourithing eity, is now a
negleted village. Where caitles and
palaces itood, fallen towers and ruined
walls appear. Where the magnificence
of the great thone, and the mirth of the

ons, we are 'brought to the clof~ie; a takP,
which in some passages may be amusing,
in others, tedious; but whether it amu-
fes or fatigu~es, is soon told, and fioon
forgotten. ·Thus, year seals upon us
after year. Life is never sanding flill
for~ a miomfent 5 bu~t continually, though
insensibly, nflding into a new form. In-
fan~cy rises up fast to childhood; child-
hood to youth; youth passes quickly
into manhood; and the grey hair and
the faded lookl are not~ long of admonish-
ing us, that old age is at hand. In this
course all generations run. The world
is made up of uncediing rounds ofitran-
fitory. exidtene. Some generations are
coming forward into being, and others
hastening to leave is. Tfhe fiream which
carries us all along, is ever flowing with

R 2 a quick

S ER M. a ~quick current, though with a ·still and

xu.~ noifleies course. The dwelling lace of

man is continually emptying,, and by a

ally filling anew, 'The memnory of man
p~afeth5 aweay, liKe the remembrance of a
guefd wheo bath· tarried but one n~zht.

As the life of man, considered in its

duration, thus fleets arid passes away,
to during the time it lasts, its condition
is perpjetually changing, It affords us
nothing on which1 we can f'et up our
reft; no enjoyment or poffeflion which
we can properly call our own. When
w~e have begun to be pllaced in s~uch cir·
cumfiances' as we defi'red, -and with our
livres to proceed in the fagme~ agreeable
tenor, how often comes some unexrpet-
ed event acrofis, to disconcert -all our
fe~hemnes of happiness ? Our health de.

fecattered; something or other is not

an eye of confident hope; and to fay, SE IRL~M
that against a year hence, he can pro- ~I

health or fortune,· as he is at present ?z
The feeds of change are every where
sown in our 4ate s and the very cauifes
that fCeemed to promire us security, are
often secretly undermining it. Great:
fame provokes the attacks of envy and
reproach. High health gives occasion
to intemperance and disease.~ The ele-
vation of the mighty never fails to ren-
der their condition tottering i and that
obscurity which thelters the mean, ex-r
profes them, at the thme time, to be-
come the pirey ·of opprefiron. So com-
pletely is the fafhi'on offt this orld made
by Providence for change, and prepared

Though this world changes and passes
away, virtue and, goodnefit never change;
God never changes; heaven and im-
mortality pass not away.

Fzirf, VI RT UE and goodneifs never

change. Let opinions and manners, con-
ditions and situations, in public and in
private life, alter as they will, virtue is
ever the [a~me. It rests on the immooe-
able basis of Eternal Truth. .Among all
the revrolutions of human thmngs it
maintains its ground, ever psffeffing the
veneratio~n and efkem of mankind, -and
conferring on the heart, which enjoys
it, ('atisfamlon and peace. Confi41t the
most remote antiquity. Look to ·the
mofL s~avage nations of the earth. How
wild, and how fludnating soever the
ideas of men may have been, - this opi-
njon you will hi~d to have always pre-
vailed, that prohity, truth, and beniefi-
cence, form the honour an the eiccel-
hacy of man. In this, the pilfpher

and the savage, the warrior and the her- 8 E R M.
mit, join. At this altar all have wor-, xII.
Thipped. Their offerings may have
been unseemly. Their notions of virtue
may have been rude, and occallonally
tainted by ignorance and superstition;
but the fundamental ideas of moral
worth have ever remained the fame.,,

H~ere then is one point of flability,

affected by no viciflitudes. of timne and
life, on which we may reft. Our for-
tunes may change, and our friends may
dies but virtue may still be our own ;
and as long as this remains, we are ne-
ver mis~erable. T~llt I die~ I we~ill not re-
mnove my integrity fromn m~e. My righte-
Oufne/s I hold faJ, and will not let it go.
My heart fha/llnot reproach me so Ilong as
Ilive.* He who, with the holy man
of old, can hold this language, may
with undiflurbed mind survey time fly-
ing away, life decaying, and the whole
fashion of the world changing around
him. He hath within himsel~f, a source
of consolation~ and hope, independent of

* Job axvii. 5, 6.

aE I M. all earthly objeas. Every terreitrial

XfII glory [parkles only for a little, with

transient baglhtners. Buit virtue thinres
with eternal and unalterable sple~ndour.
It derives its origini from heaven; and
partakes both of the luffre, and the Rta-
bility, of celestial objeas. It is the
bri~ghtefs of the everlafing kgh~t ; th~e
unspotted mi~rrr of God, anzd the imnage of
hizs goodnaefs.

IN the fconrd place, God never chain*

ges. AmidA the uncealing vicifirtude
of earthly things, there remains at the
head of the univers~e an eternal protec-
tor of virtue, whle th~ronel is eJfalkFhed
~forever. With him there itno eari-

S ER M. fleeting s~cenes of this life are to be con-

xII. fidered as no more than an introduation

to a nobler and more permanent order of
things, when man th~all have attained
the maturity of his being. This is what
reason gave some ground ·to expe~t;
what revelation has fully confirmed; and
in confirming it, has agreed with ther~en-
timents and anticipation of the good and
wife in every age. We are taught to be-
lieve, that what we now behold, is only
the first flage of the life of man. We
are arrived no farther than the threih-
old s we d~well as in the outer courts of
exiffence. Here, tents only are pitch-
ed; tabernacles ere~ted for the fojoiur-
ners of a day. But in the region of
eternity, all is great, flable, and un-
changing. There the manjons of the
juff· are prepared : there, the czity wrehich
h5ath foundations is built; there is efitabr-
liihed, the kingdom whi~tch ·cannoi Ee

which is never troubled. There thines

that river of pleasures, whtich is always

SERMIf. rrRANQU ILLITY of mind, or,

cc~.5. in the words of the text, a mind not

movued or dif~quieted by the accidents of
life, . is undoubtedly one of the greateit
bklefings that we can poffers on earth.
It is here mentioned as the reward of the
man, whof'e charadecr had been deferibed
in this psalm, as leading a virtuous life,
Pad discharging his duty tqwards' God and

and his neighbour. It is indeed the ulti- S ER IM.
mate aim, to which the withes of the
wif~e and refle~ting have ever been di-
redted, that with a mind undiflurbed by
anxieties, cares, and fears, they might
pass their days in a pleasing serenity.
They just~ly concluded that, by enjoying

This happy tranquillity, the multitude

conceive to be most readily attainable by
means of wealth, or, at leafs, of an easy
fortdne s which they imagine would set
them above all the ordinary diflurbanc~es
of life. That it has some effe&t for this
purpos~e, cannot be denied. Poverty and
firaitened circumstances, are often incon-
fiftent with tranquillity. To be destitute
of thos~e convenien~cies that fa~it our rank
in the world 3 to be burdened with an-
xiety about making provision for every
day which passes over our head s inflead

SE R M. rounded with their wants and complaints,
xm.' are circumitances which cannot fail to

give much uneasines~s to every feeling
mind. To take meafulres, therefore, for
attaining a competent fortune, by lauda-
ble means, is wife and proper. Entire
negligence of our affairs, andlindifference
about our wrorldly circumitances, is, for
the most part, the consequence of forne
vice, or some folly.--At the fame time, I
muff observe, that the attainment of opu-
lence is no- certain method of attaining
tranquillity .Embarrafinments and vexa-
tions often attend it; and long experience
has thown, that tranquillity is far from
ibeing always found among the rich.
N~ay, the higher that men rife in the
world, the greater degrees of power and
diflinction which they acquire, th~ey are
often the farther removed from internal
peace. The world affords to many in-
stances of mif'eries abounding in the
higher ranks of life, that it were need-
les~s to enlarge on a topic so generally
known and admitted.

Alianrring

Affaming it, therefore, for an un- SER I.

doubted truth, that the mere poffefiion 3IfL
of the goods of fortune may be confif-
tent with the want of inward tranquillii
ty, we muff look around for other more
certain grounds ofit. We must enquire
whether any line of condua can be
pointed out, which, independent of ex-
ternal situation in the world, shall tend
to make us eas~y in mind; thall either
beffow, or aid, that tranquillity which
all men desire. The remaining part of
this ditcourfe shall be employed in fug-
gelling, with great plainner~s of s~peech,
such direaions as appear to me the moit
material on this important fubjeat.

Tut sirs dire~tion, which I have to

su~ggest, is, that we imitate the charader
of the man who is deferibed in this psalm
as walki~ngprgt, urtly, o'K'9rkingrgt eoufneft
anzd peakzing the@ tru'lth,~ as e th~inketh i~n his
hearts that we fludy to preserve a clear
cOnscience, and to lead a virtuous and ho-
nourable, at least air inoffenfive and in-
nocent, life. Olf uch ampn on isca

s ta M.bhe Ikid, that doting these rlztig~i be fkalln~e w

.xn ver bemoved. So great is the power of

consci~ence over every huiman being, that
thre remembrance of crimes nevter fails to
overthrow tranquillity of mind. Be at-
faured, that' he who defrands his neigh-
ho~ur, who has enfhared the innocent,
has viola~ted his truss, or betrayed his
friend, thalP n~ever enjoy withlin hiimfelf
undiflurbt~ed quiet. His evil deeds wi~ll
at times re-cur to his thaoughts, like
ghoffs r-lifing9 up in b~lack array before
him to Ihaunt his c~ouch. -Even the
ferife ofa ~foo~lish and trifling conded, of
a life paRt in id-lenef~ ~and dissipation s by
which, thourgh umanhlasnot een guilty
of great crimes, he has however wasted
his firbttance, mifpent his time, and
brought upon himself just ·reproach;
etven this~, I fiay, -is fufficient to create
much unedfinefs a~nd difqu~iet-totheheart.
Let him, therefore, who withes to enjoy
tra~nquitity, An~dy abtove all-thin~gs,:tout

To this tefiamony of a good cons~cience
let, him be able,

IN the second place, to join humble

truR in the favour of God. As, after
the beit enideavours we can us~e, no
man's behaviour will be entirely faultn
leTs, it ~is ef~featial to peace of mind,
that we have fame ground for hope in
the Divine mercy, that, through the
merits of Jesus Chriit, our defea~s thall
be forgiven, and grace be thewn us by
Heaven. - This includes allthe duties.
of faith and repentance that are re-
quired by the Golpel; the faithful diit
charge of which duties is abloilutely ne-
ceffary for delivering us firom those fears
of anfpther world, which, if not allayed,
are fuSfficient to banifhn all tr~anquillity·
from ~the heart. Our religious principles
mui& at the f~ame t~ime be found a~nd
pure; and Carefully pres~erved from the

~taint:

rI~ ors, taking poffeflion of weak and ill-
informed minds, convert what they
miitake for religion, into' a foulrce- of
mif~ery.---Moreover, it is necei~ary, that
we be able to place truit in God, not
only as our future Judge, but as the
present Governor of human affhirs. So
uncertain is· the continuance of every
earthly comfort, that he, who reposes no
confidence in the Supreme Dispos~er of
events, muff be often dif~quieted and de-
jeAed. He alone poffeffes firm tranquil-
lity, who, amidst all human vicifirtudes,
looks up, with f~ettled truit, to an al-
mighty Ruler,' as to one under whose
conduat he is fCafe. To him alone Ibe-
longs that happy privilege, defecribed by
the Psalmist. He jallnotbe afraid of

I have pointed out the primary and e~-·

fential foundations of tranquillity; vir-
Fuous condue, good priniciples, and -pious
gifpoitions. ··At the -fame time;. a man

may be both pious and virtubus, and yet, S ER M.
through some defeas in the manage-,,
ment of ,his mi~nd and temper, may not
possess that happy s~erenity and fTelf-
enjoyment, which ought to be the por-
tion of virtue and piety. Instances of
this will occur to every one who is ac-
quainted with the world. We too often
behold perf'ons, whos~e principles, and
whos~e moral conduat, are in the main
unexceptionable, leading an uncomfor-
table life; through fr~etfulnefs of temper,
peeviihnefs of manners, or f~ullenner~s of
difpolition. There is, therefore, foime
discipline to be fludied; there are some
s~ubsidiary sparts of charadter to be at-
tended to, in order to give piety and
virtue their full effed for conferring
tranquillity. To the consideration of
there r~econxdary means I now proceed.
Let me then advise you,

In the thzird place, to attend to the

culture and improvement of your minds.
A fund dfdeful kilowledge, and a flock

S ER M. of ideas, afford much advantage for the

xx'u. enjoyment of tranquillity. I do not

mean, that every man must fludy to be-
come deeply learned. The situation of
many would not allow it. The taste,
and th~e habits qs others, prevent it.
But what I mean is, that every man who
withes to lead a comfortable life thould
provide for himself, as much as he can,
by means ps obs~ervation, reading, and
re fleating, alarge field of useful thoughts.
In a mind absolutely vacant, tranquillity
is feldomn found. The vacancy too
often will be filled up by bad desires
and passions. Whereas the mind of a
wife man is a kingdom to itfg~f. In his.
lonely, or melancholy hours, he finds al-
ways resources within himself, to which
he can turn for relief. As there are
many occasions when external objefts
afford no pleasure, it is only by being
alble to reft on the entertairnments as-
forded to himself by his -mind, that any
one can pds ·his days with fElf-erkjoy-
ment. Liet me recomm~end· so t~he fame
$urpof~e,

IN the furth-~ place, that we be always S ER M.

. XIII.

careful to provide proper employment,,
for our time. Reguar induffry and-
labour, with intervals of ease, is perhaps
the slate most conducive of any to tran-
quillity. If our itation give no call to
induffry, it will be profitable that we
fludy to have some end or objeat in
view, to which our attention thall be
direated. Relaxation from intens~e, or
incessant pursuit, is requisite for com-
fort. But if relaxation degenerate into
total idleness, it becomes in a high
degree adverse~ to tranquillity. Every
man by his nature, is formed, more or
less, for adion. In a mind that is entirely
quiercent, and that has no objea to put
it into motion, inflead offelf-enjoyment,
there will be cdhitant languor, tedious-
nes~s, and mis~ery. Life itagnates in such
a situation, like a pool of dead waters;
and the man becomes a burden to him-
self Piolent and dangerous purs~uits,
which Mtraft and embroil thos~e who are
engaged in ·them, I cannot be underflood
to recommend. Every one fees how so-

reign

S ER M. reign there are: to a Rtate of tranquillity.

I ,But in the ordinary tenor of calm and

eafCy life, I would advis~e every one to
have some end before him; some objeA
which thiall bring the mind into adtion,
and fill up the vaculties of time. Pro-
vided the objeal be innocent, and of no
unfuzitable or degrading nature, it may
answer this purpoife, though it thould~
nlot be in itself of high importance. It
is beltter for the mind to have some
determinate direationl given it, than to
be always left floating, as it were, in
empty [pace.--But about whatever ob-
jeals we are employed, it is itill more
material to tranquillity that, in the

Fifcth place, we learti to govern our

pa~ffons. There are the moi frequent
diturbers of our peace. Necessary as
their impulse is to give aativity to the
mind, yet if they are not kept in fu~bor-
dination to reason, they ipeedily throw
all things into confusion. Such ofthem
as belong; to the malignant and unsocial
class, evidently tend to produce vexation
and d~isquiet. Again ftuffering ~itheet

gain poireflion of the heart, admonition SERa M.
is fearcely nece~ary. But I mudi ad_ xtuI.
momfih yp2, that even those~ which are
accounted of innocent nature, and whic~h
therefore may lay hold of virtuous
minds, if they obtain the entire maitery,~
are fufficient to overthrow the tranquil-
lity of life. Let every one, therefore,
wh~o values that tranquillity, itudy to
retain moderation and felf-command,
even in the midiR of passions which have
a fair and bland appearance. He w7ig
find that the gratification of any one of
them, compenfagtes not that perpetual
slavery to which it will reduce. him,
when it becomes inordinate.

I have farther to admoniah you, that

this felf-con~mand is particularly necer-
f~ary in all that relates to habitual temper.
Even where firong passions are out of
the question, thos~e slighter emotions
which ruffle or four the temper, are idu-
ficient, by their frequent recurrence, to
poifonall felf-enjoyment. He who
would poi~ef a tranquil Rtate, muit,
above all things, cultivate calmneis and

gentleness

SER M. gentleneis of difpolition. H-e ought

.XI.efpecially to cultivate it in that aciety,

whether domeitic or facial, withi which.
he has moR tfrequent intercoui&i. We
all know, that there are thous~ands who
ine public, and in formal companies, ap-
pear to be all gentlenes~s and tw~eetne·Cs,
but who, at home, and among their
nearest relations, give vent, with free-
dom, to the moit harth and peevish dif-
Ipolitions. Such persons are not likely
to enjoy much real comfort. For it is
in the daily and familiar intercourse of
life~, that temper chiefly exerts its power,
either for promoting or for disturbing,
the tranquillity of our days. On oc-
cations wheri men come clofeit together,
if, infiead of meeting in iimooth contedt,
they rub and grate on one another, the
feelings produced art both sides ar-e ofthe'
mom offenfive and difpleaitig klind.
Nothing can be afflimed as a more cer-
tain axiom~, than that he who allows
either inordinate passions, or a cross
temper, to govern him, muit, thodugh
he thould posSe~s. all ~that lo~urith-

iflg

ing fortune can beft~low, be a firanger to S ER NT.
tran uillity .,"".

In the fxth~ place, let me advise you

never to expea too much fr-om the
world. High hopes, a~nd florid views,
are great enemies to tranq~illity. When
rashly indulged, they are conflantly
producing dis~appointments. Their in-
dulgence, in the mean time, occasions
discontent with our present Gtuation;
and he who is .dis~contented cannot be
happy. One of the first lessons, both
of religion and of wif~domn, is, to mode-
t'ate our expedtations and hopes; and not
to set forth on the voyage of life like
men who expedt to be always carried
forward with a favourable gale. Let
your views be faited to your rank and
flation in the world; and never soar fan·-
taftically beyond them. Content your-
fielves with sober pleasures, and form;
your relish to them. Be thankful when
you are free from pain, though you
be not in the mridfF of ~high enjoy-
ment. Be fCatisfied if the path yoti
tread be easy and finooth, though it be

not

S ER M., not itrewed with flowers. I-luman life

X' admits not of continued pleas~ure; nor is

it always rendered happy by great ex-
altation. Remember, that it is a inid-
dle reg-ion which is the natiive flation of
tranquillity. It neither aspires to those
heights of the atmorphere where the
thunder is formed; nor creeps always on
the ground. Affed~ not, on every oc-
caslon, to put yours~elves forward. Be
content to retire sometimes into the
thade 3 and allow others to take their
proper place.---It will be easily seen,
that I speak not now to the ambitious
and aspiring; but to those who value
tranquillity more than s~plendid ap-
pearance in the world.

Such persons I also advis~e, while they

exped not too much from the world,
neither, also, to form too high expeata-
tions from the charaders of thofe~i on
whos~e friendship they reit, and with
whom it is their lot to be conneded, ei-
ther in facial or domeilic i-elationis. If you
have looked for perfeaion any where,
y~ou will find yourself disappointed; and

the

the consequence of this difadppointment S ER IV,
will be, that friendihip will cool, and ,IT
disgust furcceed. If you with to enjoy
comfort in any of your connedtions, take
your fellowde~reatures as they are, and
look for their imperfeations to appear.
You know you have your own; bear with
those of others, as you expea that they
are to bear with you. As no one is with-
out his failings, few also are void. of ami-
able qualities. Seled for your compa-
nions, those who have the greatest thare
of such qualities ; and value them accord-
ingly.-In a word, make the best of this
world as you find it. Reckon both on
the slate of human life, and on the
society of men, as mixed, and chequered
with good and evil. Carrying alwjays
in your eye such views of things, you
will be best formed to those equal s~pirits,
and that reasonable d~ifpolition of mind,
which make the basis of tranquillity.
I thall only add as my

Seventh~, and last adtvice on the, f~ubjea,

'to

SE IVI. Mto mix retreat with the Baive business

xIII. of 'the world, and to cultivate habits of
~-y-J erious thought and recolleasion. I~be ore

advised ·those who are not particularly
engaged in saive life, to-frm to th~em-
fielves fome~objeat of pursuit, in order-to
furnish proper employment to time and
thought. But the great multitude of
men are in a different situation. Indus-
try is required of them; business and
cares press; and aaive puyrfuits occupy
their clof~eit attention. He, whot, in
this situation, pours himself forth incef-
f'antly on th~e world, cannot escape par-
taking much of its diflurbance and trou-
ble. Amidst bustle, intrigue, and dif-
f~enfion, he muff pass many an uneasy
hour. Here an enemy encounters him;
there, a rival meets him. A suspicious
friendla~arms him one hour s an ungrate-
ful one provokes him the next. I do not
recommend, that for these reasons, he
who fludies tranquillity thould retire
from all public business, and fortake
the haunts of men. This were -the
r-etreat of a monk, not of a good and a

wi~e.

so their own miieonduat; and whenV'
they can devise no other cauf'e, they lay
·them to the charge of Providence.
Thieir folly leads them into vices; their
vices into misfortuines; and in their mis-
fortunes they fret againf the Lord. They
are doubly unj uff towards God. In thteir
prof'perity, they are apt to afecribe their
success to their own diligence, rather
thlan to God's blefirng; and in their
adversity, they impute their diitreffes
to his providence, not to their own

the very reverfie of this. E~very good
and every perfet1 gift cometh from above ;
and of evil and mifbry, man is the au-
thor to himself.

let us proceed,

II. To· confider the initernal slate of

man. It is certain that much di~qu'iet
and misery may be found: there, although
his outward condition appear undiffurb-
ed, and easy·. As far ais this inward dif--
quietu'de arises from the flings of co~n-
Ecience, and the horrors of guilt, thiere~
can be no· doub-t of its. being felf-cre-
at~ed misery i which it' is altogether imt~-
polible to impute to Heaven. But,
even, when great crimes, and deep re-
mIorfe~, are not the occaiions of torment,
howv often is poifion infai'ed into the moit
flourihibing conditions of fortune, by
the' follies and the pafflons of the profG
perou~s ? We fee them peevish and redt-
less 3 cor'rupted· with luxury, and ener-
vated by ease i imptatient of the hialleit

around them. How many Hamzans,
~Hazaels, and .Elerads, are there in the
world, who, from what they f~uffer
within, pass their days in more vexati-
on and misery, than they who undergo
the hardships of poverty ?~ Dare such
·men, in their inoft dis~contented mo-
~ments, charge the providence of Hi~ea-
ven with miseries of their o~wn procur-
ing ? Providence had put into their
hands the fairest opportunity of passing
their life with comfor t. But they t~hem-

whSich

S ER M . vhich' abound in the world, we are the
xiv. chief authors. Among the multitudes

who are, at this day, bewadlihgg their
condition and lot, it will be found to
hold of far the greater p~art, that they are
t~eaping the fruit of their ow~n doings;
their iniquizties are reproving them, and
their backflidings corredting the~m. Unat-
tainable objeas fooliithy pursued, in-
temperate pafflons nourithed, vicious
pleasures and desires indulged, God and
God's holy laws forgotten ; th'efe, there
are the great ifcourges of the world s the
great cau~es of the life of man being so
embroiled and unhappy. God hath or·-
dained our sla~te on earth to be a mnixed
anid imperfee slate. We have ourselves
to blame for its becominrg anr infupport-
able one. If it, bring forth nothing" to)
a~s but vexation and vanity, we have.
sown the f~eeds of that vanity and vex·
ationi s and as we hlave sown, w~e must
reap.--I now prolceed to make irn-
provement of those truths wjh~ich we
have been considering.

IN th sirs place, let us be taught, to

look

look upon fin as the source of all our S ER M.
miseries. It may sometimes assume the xr
gentler names of folly, irregularity, or
levity a but under whatever form it ap-
pears, it always imports a deviation from
that sa~cred law which ought to regulate
our condue., It is skill the ro;ot ~that
beareth gall and ·reormweood*k; and in
exas proportion to the quantity of this
poisonous weed, which we ourselves
have infus~ed into our cup, we must ex-
pea to drink the waters of bitterness. If
th'e fooh~luefS of manz did not pe~rvert his
wat~ys, his heart would have no occaiion
to fret again]l the Lord. He would
enjoy competent fatisfamion in every
situation oflife; and~ under its unavoid-
able evils, would derive consolation from
religion and virtue. -indeed, of every
evil which~ we now endure, h8s those~
evils which we look upon to be .the
appointment of providence, as welibs
ofothers, fin is ultimately the cause;
as it was man's revojlt from God,

we undergo, in this slate of difrcipline,
necefrary, even for the sons of God··.
`But at present, we confine our observation
to thos~e miieries of which men ·are the
immediate procurers to themselves; and
from them alone, we find' ifufcient
r~eason to confider fin as the capital foe
to man; as the· great troubler and dif-
turber of his life. To Providence, then,
let us look up with- reverence. On fin let
our· indignation be vented; and,. what is
of more consequence, againRt fin and all
its approaches, let our utmoA caution be
employed; As we proceed through the
differenit paths of life, let us accuf10m
ours~elves to beware of fin, as the hidden
fnaake lurkeing among the grttis, from
whos~e- fatal touch we muff fly in .haste,
if we would not experience its. fl~ing.

with, he ihows his :ignorance of the
world. He thows that he nows not,
he underflands not, even his worldly

human society.

IN thefemoizd place, let us learn from

what has been iAt forth, one of the most
awful and importan~t of all truths, the re-·
ality of a divine govermnent exercised
over the world. Blind muff that man be,
who dircerns not the most flririing marks
of it, mn the do~trine which has been un-
der our view. If there be a feeptic, who
contends, that unrdtrailled liberty in the
gratification of desire i$ ghren to mian;
that in the fight ofhiis Cli~etor, all a~tions
are equal; and that no rule of moral con-
duat hath been preferibed, or by anyl pe-
nalty enforced; in order to confute s~uch
a man, we have not recourse to reason-:
ings, 'but fitnply appeal to plain and
obvious fadis. We bid him look only;
to the life ofmazis and 'take notice how
every vice, is by~ the conflitution of

U 2 things,

SER M~.things, conneated` with misery. TiVe:

~IS~bid him trace the history of any one,

wyith whos~e crondu~t he had~ particular
occasion to be acquainted; and observe,
whether the chief misfortunes whfich
pursued him were not brought upon
him by his own misbehaviour. We bid
him remark in the history of nations,
w~hether public virth~e has not always
ex~alted them; and wlhether licentious-
ness and crimes have not pavred the way
for ;theirs ruin. There are testimonies to
the truth of religion, which cannot b~y
any fophiffry ,be evaded. This is a
voice, which spe~aks its warnings loud
and firong to every heart,

T~he iyfiem upon which the divine go.

that men's ownm IPicked2efs ~ihould be gp-

Chould in a manner ejrecute themselves,

to interrupt the order of nature. With

ded, to the famre purpos~e, in a following
vere, the, righ7teoufn~eS s Of the pe~rfed7

ny who will. admit, that integrity is
an amiable quality; that it is entitled
to much refpeat, and in moil cafes
ought to influence our behaviour s
who neverthele~'fi r'sin~`it il6l~illy' to
allow it the chief placei~'h~ l it~i~f~thrfioi K
of their worldly conduA. They hold,
that a certain artful fa~sgacity, founded
upon knowledge of the world, is the beit
conduaorof every one, who would be a
f~uccef'sf ifi adventurer in life; and that a
firfat attention to. integrity, as his only

iguide,

guide, would often lead him into danger S ERaM
and diffrefs. In 0 foition to tenets ofV
this Icind, I now purpose to ihew, that
amidst all perplexities and dangers, there
is no guide we can choose so s~afe, and to
f~uccef~sful on the whole, as the integrity
of anupright mind; and that upon every
trying occasion, principles of probity and
honour willconduet a good man through
life with more advantage, than if he
were to act uponl the most refined fyG-~
t~em of worldly wif'dom,

ITr will not take much time to deli-

neate the charadter of the man of inte-
grity,as byits nature it is a plain one, and
easily under flood. He is one, who makes
it h~is conflant rotle to follow the road of
duty, according as the word of God, and
the voice of his confciecnce, point it out
to him. He is not guided merely by as-
feaions, which may fomnetimes give the
colour of virtue to a loos~e and unstable
charader. The upright man is guided
b~y a fixed principle of mind, which de-
termines him to' efleemn nothing ·but

what

8 E R 1M. what is honourable; and to abhor whiat,

i ever Is base and unworthy, in moral con-

duat. Hence you find him ever the
fame; st all times, the trufly friend, the-
affeaionate relation, the conscientious
man of busines~s, the pious wort~hipper,
the public [pirited citizen. He assumes
no borrowed appearance. He feekrs no
mask to cover him; for he aats no flupid
part; but he is in tr~ith what he appears
to be, full of truth, candour, and huma-
nity. In all his purs~uits, he knows no
path but the fair and direA one s and
would much rather fail of fuzccef~s, th~an
attain it by reproachfill means. He never
thows you a smiling countenance, while
he meditates evil against you in luis
heart. He never praires you among
your friends i and th1en joins in traduC-
ing you amonig your enemies. You will
never find one part of hiis charadter at
variance with another. In his manners,
he is limple and una~ffe~ted; in all his
proceedings, openand conf~ifent.-rSuch
as the man of integrity spoken of in the
text. Let us now proceed to ihow, in

wNha(

what manner, and with what effeat, in- S'ER M,
tegrity serves for the guide ofllis life. V

EVERY one who hes begun to make

any progress in the world, will be fenfW-
bile, that to conduet himf'elf in human as-
fairs with wif'dom and propriety, is often
a matter of no fmnall difficulty. Amidst
that variety of charaders, of jarring
difpolitions, and of· interfering interefls,
which take place among those with
whom we have intercourfei, we are fre-
quently at a Rand, as to the part meft
prudent for us to chufie.· Ignorant of
what is pafirng in the breasts of those
around us, we c~an form no more than
doubtful conjeaures concerning the
~events that are likely to happen. They
inay take some Iturn altogether different
from the cou~rse in which we had ima-
gined they were to run, and according
to which we had formled our plans. The
slightest incident often thoots out into
importan~t confiequendes, of which we
were not aware. The. labyrinth be-
comes to intricate,'thiat the most saga-

cious .

. SE R M. Clous can lay hold on no clue to guide

XLhim through it: He finds hims~elf em-

barraffed, and at a loss how to adt. -I
public and in private life, in maznaging
our own concerns, and in diredting those

'ofothers, th~e doubt flarted by the Wife

man frequently occurs; W~~io knowreeth
Wha~t is good for mana in th~is (fe ---While
thus fatigued with conjeafure, we re-
main perplexed and undetermined in
our choice s we are at the fa~me time
pulled to different sides, by the various
emotions which belong to our nature.
On one hand, pleas~ure~ allures us to
what is agreeable; on the other, interest:
weighs us down towards what seems
gainful. Honour attradts us towards
what is ifplendid; and indolence inclines
us to what is easy., In the confidx~tations
.which we hold with our own mind,
concerning our condua, how often are
we. thus divided within ourselves; puz.
zled by the uncertainty- of future events,
and diffraded. by the conteit of diff~er-
ent inclinations ?

IT

ILt Ts in s~uch situation~s as ther~e, that S ER IVE

the principle of integrity interpos~es to ,xv.
give light and dire~tion. While worldly
men-·iduuate in the midRt of those~ per-
plexities which I have deferibed, the
virtuous man has ·one Oracle, to whiich
he resorts in every dubious cafCe, and
whose decisions ·he holds to be infallible:
He consults his conscience. He listens to
the voice of God. Were it only on a
~few occasions that this Oracle could be
cons~ulted, its value wyould: be less. But
it is a mist-ake to imagine, that its Ref-
ponfes are se~ldom given. Hard~ly is there
any material tranfadi~ion whatever in hu-
man life, any important quefiton, that
holds us in ful~pence as to pranice, but
the difference between right and wrong
will thew its~elf ; and the principle of
integrity wrill, if we ~listen to it impar-
tially, give aclear deciiion.' Whene-
ver the mind is divided within its~elf.
conscience is seldom or never neutral.
There is always one fide or other to
which it leans. There is always one
fecale of. th~e balarie, - into which it

throws

SER M.throws the weight of some virtuse; or

fame~jij praire s of something that is just and
true, lovely, koneyt, and of good report.
There are the forms, which rife to the:
observation of the upright man. By
others they may be utnfeen, or over-
looked; but in his eye, the luffre of virtue
outfhines all other brightneifs. Wherever
this pole star dire~ts him, he iteadily
holds his cours~e. -Let the ifrue of that
course be ever so unrertain; let his
fr~iendls differ from him in opinion s let
]his enemies clamour; he is not moved;
ihis purpoie is fixed. He asks but one
queffion of his heart, what is the most
worthy and honourable part i what is the
part moit becoming the Rtation which
he poffeffes, the charaater which he
withes to bear, the expe~tations which
good men entertain of him ? Being once
decided as to this, he hesitates no more.
H~e thats his ears against every folicita-
tion. He pursues the direst line of inte-
grity, without turning either to he righ~t

of the cours~e of human affairs. Let us
enquire who the persons are that, in all
the dif;ferent lines of life, have gone
through the world with moit success;
and we ilhall find, that the men of probity
and honour form by far the most con-
fiderable p~art of the lift-; we thall find
that men of plain underflanding, a~ting
upon fair and direcc views, have muc'h
oftener prosp~ered, than men of the deep-
eft polic~y, who were devoid of principle.
How few are the instances of persons who
by fidelity, worth, and fledfaft ad~herence
to their duty, have either loss their for-
tunes, or incurred general displeas~ure, in:
times when human affatirs were proceed-
ing in their ordinary arain·? But how nu-
merous and ·frequent are the examples 0
thof'e whose profpeats have been blasted
whose circumffances have been ruined
and their names funk into contempt b]
vice and, dithonefty ?

The man of the world aims at highe

things

things, and more rapid s~uccess, than the S ER M.
man of moderation and virtue. But, at xv.
the ame time, he incurs greater rifques
and dangers. No calculation of proba-
bilities can enfurre safety to him who is
ading a deceitful part. Amidit the un-
forei~en viciflitudes of the world, he has
to dread, not only disappointment to his
plans, but the miieries also which deteaf-
ed fallacies may bring· on his head. He
walks on the edge of precipices, where a
single false flep may be fatal. H~e fol-
10ws a wandering light, which, if it fail
of guiding him by a thort path to the Pa-
lace of ambition, lands him in the pit, or
the lake. Whereas he who follows the
guidance of integrity, walks in the high
road on which the light of the f~un thines.
He fees before him the Habitation of
peace to which his iteps are diredted;
and if he be longer of arriving at it,
he is fuxre of neit'her wandering far
affray, nor of meeting on his road
with any forms of unusual terror.
----et it be always remembered
that the principle of integrity which

Xi direds

S ER M. dire~s a good man, is far from excluding

" prudence in the conduA of'life. It im-

plies no improvide'nt or thoughtlers iim-
plicity. On the contriary, it is clos~ely
conneaed with true wisdom. A man of
enlarged capacity, and extensive views, is
always upright. Craft is merely the
s~upplement of inferior abilities. It cha-
raderizes a narrow comprehenflon, and
a little mind.-Ais the path of integ~rity
is on the whole the f~afef1 path of con-
dnat; so,

IN the second place, it is tirqueftionaj

ibly the moss honourable. Integrity is
the foundation of· all that is high in
charader among mankind. Other qua-
lities may add to its fplend~ori but if this
essential requisite be wanting, all their
lufire fades. Were I drawing the cha-
racter of one who claimed the9 admiration

r~of the world; and after I had aferibed

to him eloq~uence, valour, and every
endowment that is moss thining agd
captivating, .did I add, that he was a
man of too much art to be t~ruffed, I ap-

peal

pealto every one, whether, by this single S ER M.
·itrsoke, the whole charadrer would not be~C~
ftrnk and degraded; An interefied and
crafty man may perhaps rife into influ-
ence and high Rtation; he may be a rich
and a powerful, but will never be a great
man. He may be feared, and externally
honoured and courted; but in the s~ecret
thoughts of men he finds no refped.
We all feel, that magnanimous s~enti-
ments cannot dwell in the faime breast:
with felfiihnefs and deceit.

He who rests upon an internal prin-

ciple of virtue and honour, will a~t with
a dignrity and a boldness, of whlich they
are incapable who· are wholly guided
by interest. He is above those~ timid
futfpicions, and cautious reffraints, which
fetter and embarral~s their conduat.
That firmness wihich the cons~ciousnes~s
of redtitude inspires, gives vigour and
force to his exertions ~on every great~
occasion. It adds double weight to
all the abilities of which hie is poffeft.
It even s~upplies the place of thos~e abili-
ties in which· he is' defeative. They

who

SER M. who oppos~e him are obliged to honolur

.V.himr. They look up to him with a

se~cret awe, as to one who moves above
them in a firperior iphere s regardless of
their good or ill opinion, of their pro-
mises or their threatenings; like one of
thos~e celeffial luminaries which holds its
cours~e through its orbit, without being
affeated by any commotions among thle
elements below. Such aman is truffed,
and relied upon, as well as effeemed,.
becaus~e all know where to find him,
and upon what fyfitem he eAs. He
attaches friends and followers to hims~elf,
without courting them; and though his
progres~s towards fame thould be flow,
and interrupted at first by crooked arts,
it is nevertheless certain and sure. The
public may be misled for a while, in
judging of real merit; but it is seldom
unjuff at the ladt. As perfEons con-.
tinue to come forward to; view, and
to aat their part in trying circumitan-
ces, their charaders are at length
fully ascertained; and, alrnoft always,
rated as they deserve. Htow gorrupt
soever the world may be, they can-

not

not with-·hold approbation from him, SERM.
whose conduet is marked by uniform in- xv.
tegrity and honour. Enemies he will
have; ~but the public favoucrs him; the
multitude of men with him su~ccess ; an~d
deffine him, In their thoughts, to every
Rtep of his preferm-ent, before he arrives
at it.

I[N the drird place, the plan of con-

duaf, on which the man of integrity pro-
ceeds is the moRt comfortable; that is,
attended with the g~reateit fatisfadion in
a man's own mind. ALmdidR the variou~s
and perplexing events of life, it is of
singular advantage to be kept free from
doubt, as to thle part mofl proper to be
chofren. He who cons~ults nothing but
worldlyintereft muff, upon every turnof
fortune, undergo muach painful fufpence.
He is obliged to list~en with anxious ear
to every whisper of report 3 and upon
every new afped which the face ~of as-
fairs assumes, muit fludy how to place
himself in a new poftlure of defence.
But the man of prikciple is a iranger to

t he re

SE R M. inward troubles. His time is not lo&;

.V nor his temper fretted by long and anxi-

ous confixutations. One light always
thines upon him from above. One path,
the path of integrity, always opens clear
and dift~indt to his vriew.- But this is
not his only advantage, to be freed from
embarraffments, by having placed hinx-
self under the charge of one conitant
guide. He is also rewarded with the
sense of having chosen his guide well.
and wifely. H~e is delivered from all in-
ward upbraidings, from all mifgbivings
of mind, from all alarms founded on
tlhe dread of dificovery and disgr~ace. A
good conscience enables him to look
back on the part which he has afted
wlith faitisfadtion ;'and to look forward to
·the iflhe which it may bring, without
concern. It is in the cafe. of one ilirue
only, that the man who aatsfrom worldly
intere~ -can enjoy f'atisfaaion s that is,
when his deligns have succeeded accord-
ing to his with. But it isthe felicity of
the man, who aAs under the diredion of
integrity, thazt in every ifrue, he has

something

something to comfort him. Though SER M.
fuzccef~s has failed him, the consolation xv.
remains of having done his duty, and
fludied to approve himself to God.

Tr~fHs reference of all his adtions to

divine approbation, furnishes another
.source of fatisfadion a'nd peace. He
looks up, with pleadiing hope, to a Pro-
teaor in the heavens, ' who lovedj r~gh-
teouf~ne/S, and wz~ofe countenapnce beholdeth~
th~e ulprgalt. The man of worldly wis-
dom is confe~ious of having no title to
the faivour of that high adminiffration
which rules the universe. By quitting
'the path of righteoufh~ef~, he has left
that firaight road, in wlhich God had ap-
pointed him to wa'lk. He has taken
the dlireation of his way to hims~elf3 and
chos~en to be his own guide and master.
To his ownl abilities, therefore, such as
they are, he must trust and is become
wvholly refponfible' for the issue of his
conduat. But the mnanof virtue hathcom-
mitited 'his wayto the Lor·d. He follows
,the divine signal. He co-operates with

the

S ER M.the divine purpos~e. The power which

fV .iways the universe is~engaged on his fide.
By natural cons~equence, he has ground
to expeA, that any se~eming difaLppoint-
mnents which he may now incur,' thall
be over-ruled at the end to some salutary
effeat. Hence, that peace of God keepzing
the he~art, to which worldly men are
thangers. Hence a degree of firmness
and res~olution in conduat, which it is
impofiible for them to possess. Efpeci-
ally wchen we add,

IN the four~t and last place, that he

who thus pursues a cours~e of integrity,
has always in his view 'the profpeAt of
immortal rewards. That surely is the
wif'eft direction of conduat, w~hich is
most amply recopmpenf~ed at last. But
what recompence can worldly wis~dom
b~efow, comparable to what is promised
by the gospel to them who, by patienat
continua~nce ini wrell rdozing, look for glEory,
bonlour, canda timm~oralzity?-The recom-
pence indeed is distant s but the hope of
it is present; and ·hope is one ·of .the

most

rnoft powerful principles of human ac- s Ba M.
tion. Let aman be firm in the belief that V
he is aaing under the immediate protec-
tion of Heaven, and that through aill
eternity he thall be rewarded for what
he now performs; and, as far as this be-
lief is prevalent, his conduat will be
fleady and determnined. Wherever reli-
gion direats him to hold his course, he
will advance with intrepidity. He will
fubmnit to restraints without reluatance.
He will meet dangers without fear. To
every motive which reason suggests in
favour of virtue, the hope of eternal life
adds supernatural firength.--Accord-
ingly, in the behaviour of many holy
pnen, under the moss trying circumftan-
ces or diffrefs, we behold this effeat
eminently exemplified. It appears, with
much luffre, in the spirited and magna-
nimous sentiments of the Apottle Paul,
when he had the profped of death be-
fore him. Behold I go bound in thre/pirit
to ferufalem, not knoweing th2e thinjgs thiat~

thlere is laid up for me a cro~wn of righZte-
ouf~nef, whzich the Lord,. the righteous
Tudgne, ./hall give me at thlat daY.s-

Tuevs I have endeavoured to thew in

what nmanner the i'ntegrity of· the u~pright
guzidecs th~em ; and what the adv~ntages
are of placing ours~elves under its guid-
ance. If it be the line of fia~fety, or the
line of honour, which we chufe to pur-
s~ue; if we consult our" present comfort,
or look forward to future rewards; in
all these: ref efts, the course which inte-
grity points out is, by far the most eligi-
ble.

It is a great recommendation of the

guidance offered. to us by integrity, that
it is easily underflood by all men. Plans

of worldly policy are deep and intrica te; ISER M.
and ex erience thews how often th~e xv.~L
ablest persons are miftakren in the mea-
fures which they adopt for carrying'
them on. But when men's intentions are
fair and uprigh~t, it will be found that a
moderate share of underitanding and at-
tention is all that is requisite, for con-
du~ting themselves with s~afety anld pro-
priety. Providence never intended, that
the art of living happily in tchis world
thould depend on that deep penetration,
that acute sagacity, and thos~e refine-
ments of thought, which few poffers.
It has dealt more graciously with us; and
made happiness to depend on upright-
nes~s of intention, much more than on
extent of capacity. For ~th~e moRt part,
the firit sentiment which firikes a good
man, concerning what he ought, or
ought not to do, is the foundet, and f~ug-
gefts the befi and wisest coun~sel. When
he hesitates, and begins to deliberate
how far his duty, or his honour, can be
reconciled to what seems his interest, he
is on the point of deviating into a dan-

g~erous

S ERi M. grerous path.--At the fame time, it is of

XV. Sgreat conse~quence, that he who seeks to

s~urrender his condudt, to the direation of
integrity, fbould be well apprized of1
what true integrity requires. Let him
guard againit burdening conscience un-
necessarily; leit a fuperflitious regard to
trifles lead him to relax in matters of
higher obligation. Let him avoid mi-
nute scrupulosity, on the one hand. Let
him keep at a dircance from loose cafu-
iltry on th~e other. But when he is f~atis-
fied that his consc~ience has been well
informed, let him, without wavering,
adhere to its didates in the whole of his
conduA. This willpcrove the truest wis-
dom both for this world and the next.

incident to human life. For no society,
no family, no person, can exped to be
long exempted from-them; and when we
speak of the prosperous, We can only
mean those who are'more rarely fubjea·

It teaches us how we ought to bear
them; and it assists us in thus bearing
them. Materials for both are found in
the words of the text, which contain a
sentiment fbo natural and juff, as to carry
convif~tion to every reasonable mind.
They were the words of Job, at a time
when, to his other calamities, this do-
meltic afflition was added, that one,
who ought to have assuaged and soothed
his s~orrows, provoked his indignation by
an1 impious sp~eech. fkou pearef2, Job
rep~lies, as one of tre fool@i womnen/peak-
eth:= What shall we-e receive good at the
h2and of GOda, anzd ./hal wee not receive
evil?--Three infiruations naturally a-
rife from the 'text : F~irit,' that this life
is a mixed slate of good and evil: Se-.
condly, That both the goods and the
_evils in it proceed from God: And,
thirdly, That there are juff reasons for
our receiving with pa~tience the evils of
life, from .the falme hand which beftows

and evil. This is a mattel- of fa&,i which ,xI
will he :denied by none, and on which
it s, not~neceiri~ary to beffow nuich illus~:
tration. It is evident to the slightest in'-
[peAion, that nothing here is unallayed
and pure. Every man's Rate is chec-
quered with alternate griefs and joys,
dis~appointment and i'uccefs. No condi-
tion is altogether flable. No life pre-
s~erves always the f~ame tenor. The vi-
ciffitudes of the world sometimes bring
forwardi the afflidtedd into ynore comnfort-
able circumxtances s apd often trouble
the Joy of the prof~pefous. This is the
train in lwhich humaq4 affairs have ever
been foundc -to proceed s and in which
we may exped- them always to go on.

But though this be univers~ally ad-

~anitedf in Epculation, and often confef-
fed in ditcourfe, the misforturne is, that
fewP think of applying it- to their own
cjafe. The bulk oss mankind ditcovter as

of evils in man's etate is owing to man

important infiru~tion, ach-ing from th~e
text; namely, that, there are many rea-
sons why we, who rec~ive good frorn
the hand of God, thould receive with
patience the erils which he ~is leafd to
inflift. Thisis ifirongly conveyed by
that interroga~tory form ·-6f [peech, in
whiich the~ i-~ntiment of Job is expressed: WQ 1;a

WhEat ? ghtall wsee receive good at thre hanid S~E

, I~r~VI

of God, and jkall wae not receive evil? In
order, to unfold all that is contained in
this appeal made to every man's confci-
ence, .1let us c~onfider,

IN the frf place, that the good things

which God has beitowed, afford fu~ffi-
cient evidence for our believing, that the
evils which he feinds, ar-e not chufelefsly
or wantonly infliated. Did we live in a
world which .bore the marks of: a mali-
cious or cruel governor, there might be
r-eason for difiruiing eviery fle~p .0f his -
condua. But in the world which' we:
inhabit, we behold, on the contrary~, plain
markis of predominant goodlnefs~. We
behold the thua~ure of the universe~, the
order of nature, the general cours~e of
Providence, obviously arrang~ed with a
benevolent regardto the: welfare of men.
All the art and contrivance of which the
divine works are full, point to this end i
and the mnore they are explored~, create
Sthe firmer belief, that the goodnes~s of

the Deirty gave rife to· the .fyftie~m of

creatiion,

S EX$IM. reation. What is the conclusion tobe

L ~~thence drawn, but that in s~uch parts of

the divine a'dminiidration as app~ear to
us harth and severe, the fame goodnef's
continues to preside, though exerciied
in a hidden and myiterious manner ?

Let me desire you to confider, whe-

ther, if some powerful friend had placed
you in an opulent and comfortable fla-
tion, and, in the general condudt of your
affairs, had dis~covered the moit difinte-
reited kindness, you would not aferibe
.any occasional d~ifcouragements you teT
ceived, to ibme unknown reason or
cause~, rather than to his un'fai~thfulnef~s
or cruelty ? Ought not the experience
which we have had, and the difpiovery
which all nature affords, of the divine
goodness, lead us to put a like confiruc-
tion on the evils which we fixffer from a
hand that hath to frequently loaded us
with good ?--Have we forgotten, in the
midit~ of our complaints, who brought
us unto the light of day s who watched
over our helplets infancy i who reared

Confider,

In the second place, that the good

things w~e receive from God are unde-
fervedl, the evils we f~uffer are jufty me-
rited. Every reasonable person must feel
the weight of this consideration, for
Sproduzcing patience and fu~bmiflion. For,
though to fuffer at any rate be grievous,
yet to fuffer unjustly, is doubly galling.
Whereas, when one receives a mixed
portion, whereof the goods are above
his des~erts, and the evils b~elow his de-
ferts, to complain, in such a cafe, is un-
reafionable athere is more ground for be-
ing thankful.-' All, it is true, have
pot deserved evil equally. Yet all of us

d~efeqe

deserve it' more or less; and to merit SE R M.
good at the hand of the Lord, is whatI_
none of us can pretend. At the bell we
are but ·unpr;9ftable fervanzts. Even this
is more than we are entitled to claim.
For if od were to enter into jusdgme~ntr
with us, who could fland before him ?
who could juff~ify himfe'ilf in his fight ?
When the -most inoffenfive compare
their: conduA with God's holy law;
when they reflea-~upon the duties they
have omitted, and the adtual guilt they
have contraded,they~will find more rea-
son to accuse themselves, than to com-
plain of the divine chaftirement. W~hat-
ever innocence any of us niay plead,
nay, whatever merit we snay claim with
ref~pea to men and the world, we iifuer
no more than what wte deserve from the
G~overnor of the world; and of his dif-
pleasu~re, we know that the wrath of
man is no other than the infirument.

Not only all of us have done evil, but.

what ought to be particularly attended
f, God has a juff title to punish us for

8 E R M. it. Although a man know that he de.

f

V erves punishment, yet he w~ill no t llow

every one to inflia it. A child will
f~ubmtit to his parents, a fervtant to his
maiter, a fubjea to the magiatrate, when
he would fiot bear correetionr kam ano-
ther hand, But no parent can have to
cbfnplete a, right to authority over his
childr~en, no jtilrdi r over his fervfants,
po magistrate over his f~ubjeas, as the
Almighty hath over us. W~henl we
were born, we br-ought nothing with us
into God's world. t)uring our. conti-
nuance ini it, we have lived on the good
things which God wvas pleas~ed to lenid
us; and of wkhic~h, God anhd our ownv
conscience know that we have striade but
a sorry impr·~vement. Whecn he thinks
proper to take any of them away no
wrong is dotte us; for they were not
ours. To hlav~e enjoyed thenti so long,
was a. fagvour. To e~njoy thien always,
was what~ we neither deserved, nor had
;Iny title to exipeRt.

IN the ~thir place, the good things

wuhich

which aediffniiesrentaiesw have received S:E M l.
and enjoyed, are snach greater than the Xr:
evils which we Ai~er. Of this fadt, I am
iknYble it will be difficult to persuade the
aflt2idld. But would they weigh, in a
fair· balance~, the whole of their circu~m-
Aances, thaey: would fin it true. What-
ever perfonsi fee at thp pref'ent, makes
to firong an impression upon them, as
very: commonly to obliterate the memory
of al the paiE. WChen one is appreffred
wyith some painfa~ diSkak in his body, or
WTrng withI some fore dif tress of 'mind,
e~very: formI~er comfort, at that moment,
go·62rnes AS nting. Life is beheldin all
its gl~oo. A dark clud feens to hang
over it and is -iS Fevled, as no other
than a feene of wretchednefis· and hetrew.
But this is to be un~juff to human life, as
well as engrateful to its' aukthor.--- Let
me only desire you to think how
many days, how many months, how:
many years, you have passed in health,
and safe, and comfort; how many
pleaforable feelings you have had;

how

SER M.how many friends you have enjoyedll

XV..how many blessings, in short, of diffe-

rent kinds you have tlified; and you will
be forced~ to acknowledge, that triore
materials of thanksgiving preient them-
selves than oflamentation and complaint(
-- -Ther~e blessings, you will fay, are
past. But though past, ought they to
be gone from your remembrance ?Do
they merit no place, in the comparative
ef~imate of the goods and evils of your
slate ? DIid you, could you,..exped2, that
in this mutable world, any' temlporal joy
wvas to last for ever ? Has gratitude no
influence to form your minds to a calm
acquies~cence in your Benefaaor's ap-
pointments? , What can be more rea-
fonable than to f~ay, " Having in former
"~ times received to many good things
"r from the hand of God, shall I not now,
'e without murmuring, receive the few
"~ evils which it pleases him to fend?"

IN the fourth plage, not only the goods

of life are upon the ~wh·ole greater .than

its evils; but the evilrs which we fulffer S ER M.
are seldom, or nekre lwithout ome mix- ,XT.
ture of .good. As there is no condition
on earth of pure unritixed felicity, so there
is none to mis~erable,. as to be destitute oif
every comfort. Entire and complete mi-
f~ery, if ever it take place, is of our own
procuring, not of God's s~ending. None
but the mos1 gross and atrocious sinners
can be in s~uch a lituation, as to dis~cover
no ray of relief or hope. In the ordina-
ry difkreffes. of life, it is generall'y our
own folly and infirmity which, upon the
10fs of some one blessing that we had
highly psrized, depr-ives us of fatisfac-
tion in all other things. Many of our
calamities are purely unagmnary, and
felf-createdi ariiing from rivalfhip or
competition with others, and from
fals~e opinions of the importance of ob-
jets, to which custom and faihion
have annexed an ideal value. W~7ere
there m~itaken opinions once correaed
by reafog, thes eiil would disappear,
and contentment would res~ume its
place. VZith ref Et to those calami-

ties

S ER M. ties which are infliFted by God, his Pro-

xV.~ vidence has made this wife and merciful

conflitution, that, after the firit thock,
the burden by degrees -is lightened.
Time brings a gentle and powerfu~l opiate
to all misfortunes. Whrat is very violent
cannot last long; ivnd what lasts long we
become accuffomed to bear. Every
situation that is permanent, at length
is felt t~o be tolera~ble. The mind ac-
cornmodates itself to tt and by degrees
regains its usual tranquillity. Hence
the greatest part of the' evils of life are
more terrible in th~e previous apprehen-
floo, than in the aftual feeling s and it
seldom happens but, 'in one Corner or
other, something is fbundl on which the
mind can lay hold for its relisef.

How many, for initance, do we

behold around us, straitened~ in t-heir
worldly circumitances, and ye t ind-
ing the means to live chearfully,
with poverty and peace in the fame
habitation ? If we are depriived of
friends ihitn we tedd~erly loved, iare
there not fli11 some rems iig, frcim

Our bodies are as Iliated with fo're diseas~e, xv~t.
hatiie we not reason to be thankful that
our mind continues vigorous and entire;
that we are in a situation to look around
us for whatever can afford us ease; and
that after the decay of this frailand moul-
dering tabernacle, we can look forward
to a h~ouse not made wz~ithI hands, eter~nal tin
the heavens ?2-In the midst of all diitrel-
fes, there remains to every sincere Chris~-
tian, that mixture of pure and genu~ine
consolation, which s~prings from the pro-
mifies and hopes of the gospel. Confider
I beseech you what a singularly hap·

SER M. VHATEVER relaltes to the be-

XVII.haviour of men in their social

charader, is of great importance in re-
ligion. The duties which [pring from
that charadter, form many branches of
the great law of charity, which is the
favourite precept of christianity. They,
therefore, who would reparate s~uch du-
ties from a religious [pirit, or who at
most treat them as only the inferior partsl

of it, do real injury to religion. They SER VI.·
are mistaken friends of piety, who, un- r
der the notion of exalting it, place it in
a fort of insulated corner, disjoined from
the ordinary affairs of the world, and:
the5 conneations of men with one ano-
t~her. On the contrary, true -piety in-
fl~uences them all. It aats as a vivifying
spirit, which an~imates and enlivens,
which redtifies and conduats them.· It
is no less friendly to men than zealous
for the honour of G~od ; and by the ge-
nerous affea~ionss which it nourishes, and
the beneficent influence whichit exerts
on the whole of conduA, is fully vindi-
cated from every reproach which the in-
fide~l would throw upon it.--In this
view, I am now to diifcourf~e on the na-
ture and duties of virtuous friendihip, a~s
closely coqneAed with the true- spirit of
religion. It is .a fiubjeft whiich the In-
s~pired philosopher who is the author of
this hook of Proverbs, has thought wor-
thy of his.repeated notice s and in many
paffagesl~as befkowed the highest elogi;

born for advlerfty. 'There is a friend that
f~icketh clo/er than a brother.-IT~hine ozwn
friend, and thy father's fri'end, it is said
in the text, forjhke not.

I MvUST begin the fubjea, by obfery-

ing, that: there are among mankind
friendiups of different kinds, or, at least,
connexions which assume that name,
W~hen they are: no more than confede-
racies of bad men, they. ought to be
called conspiracies, rather than friend-
(hips. Some bondof common interest,
some league againfk the innocent and
unf~ut~eaing, may have united them for
a time. But they are held together only
by a, rope of farid. At botym they are
'all rivals, and hostile to one another.
Their friendship can hfubift no lontger than

than interest cements them. Every one.S ER M.
looks with a jealous eye- on his s~uppos~ed ~
friend; and watches the firit favourable
opportunity to desert, or to betray.

Friendihips too there are ofa diffe-

rent kind, and of a more re~pettable na-
ture, formed by the conneftion of poli-
tical parties. It is not, perhaps, on el-
fish or crooked deligris that such friend-
thips are originally founded. Men have
been associated together by some public
interest, or general cause, or for defence
against some real or imagined danger s
and connexilons thus formed, ~oftenr draw
men into close union, and inspire for a
season no imall degree of cordial attachi-
rnent. When upon juff and honourable
principles this union is founded, it has
proved on various occasions, favourable
to the caus~e of liberty and good order
among mankind. At the fame time,
nothing is more ready to be abuted than
the name of public spirit, and a public
caws6.; It is a name, under which pri-
vate intereit is often theltered, and fel-
Edlh designs a.re carr~ied on. TShe un-

SER M. forth the heart to one. whom we love

_ and trait, is the chief comfort, perhaps

the only relief, we can enjoy. Mifera-
ble is he who, that up within the nar-.
row,inclofure of f'elfifh iixtereft·, has no
person to whom he can at all times, with
full confidence, expand his foul.

SINCE cordial friendship is to great a

blefirng to human life, let us proceed to
confider what duties it requires, and by
what methods it may be cultivated to
most advantage. The fundamental qua-
lities of true friendship are, conflancy
and fidelity. Without there material
inigredients, it is of: no value. An in-
conflant man is not capable of friend-
thip. He may perhaps have affee-
tions which occasionally glow in
his heart s which excite fondness for
amiable qualities; or connedt him with
seeming attachment to one whom he
efleems, or to whiom he has been
obliged.· But after there feelings have
last-ed for a little, either fanc~ied intereit
alienates him, or fam~e gw objea at-

trade him; an'd he is no longer the SER M.
fame, person to thos~e whom he once xvn_.,
loved. A· mran of this inconflant mind-
cannot be: said to have any mind at all.
For where there isano fixedness of moral2
principle, occaiional feelings are of no
value s mind is of no effefl ; and withr
furch persons it is never desirable to have
any connexion. Where conflancy is
wanting, there can be no fidelity, which
is the other basis of friendship. For
all fr-iendship furppofes entire confidence
and truit; i fppofres the feal of s~ecrecy
to be inviolable; supposes promises and
engagements to be fagcred; and no ad-
vantage of our own to be purfured, at the
expence of our friend's honour. An
inconflant man, is deipicable. A faith-
lets man, is bale.

But supposing neither conflancy nor

fidelity to be altogether wanting, Aill
however friendship is in hazard of sus-
fering fom the follies, and unreas~onable

humou'rs,

SE 14M. humours, to which all of us are liable.

xv'Il It is to be regarded as a tenders plant in

C an unfavourable ib~il, which, in order

to its flourithingi requires to· be reared
a~nd nursed: w~ih care. The following
dire~ions may be of dfe for promot-
ing its cultivation, and preserving it
from whatever might be apt to blast
and wither i~t.

IN the Jir/1 pllace, let use advise

you not to expea perfeationi' in any
with whom you conitraa friendship.
It holds in general,- with ref'ped to all
worldly purfiuits, that the more mode-
rate our expdations are, they are
likely to be the more E~uccef~sful. If,
in any situation of life, we hope to
possess~ complete happiness, we may de-
pend on receiving mortifications. If, in
any perfoni, we trui~t to find nothing biut
perfeAion, we na-y be afrured that on
longer acquaintancei we shall meet with
difsppo~intmnents. In the cafe offrierndi
thip, this admonition is the more neceffa-

ry to be given, as a certain warmth and SE M~.xvr
enthuliafm belong to it, which are apt to I·.
carry sk5 beyon~d the bounds of nature.
In youing ininds, especially, a dif~polition
of this ~kind is often found to take place.
They fb~rm to thrernfielves romantic idiias,
gathered perhaps fromn fi(5itious histories,
of the high and heroic qualities which
belong to human nature. All those qua-
lities they alcribe,_without res~erve br li-
mitation, to the person with, whom they
with to tenter into intimate friendship s
ando~n the leaftfailure: appe~aring, aliena-
tioin tidantly fo~ll~ewil HIence many a
friendfh'ip, hastily perhk~aps corntradted, is
as hastily dissolved, and difguff s~ucceeds
to vliolent attachinent.-Remember, my
friends, that a faultles~s charader on eart-h
is a mere chrimera. iVlany failings you -
experience in yourselves. Be not f~urpri-
fed, when you discover the like in others,
of whom you had ~formed the highest
opinion. The beiffi:nd mos1 eitimable
perfonsare they, in whom thefEeweft ina-
terial defea~s are found; and whose great

and

SER M.and solid qualities counterbalance' the
X VII, ~common infirmities of men. It is to

ther~e qualities you are to look in forming
friendships; to good sense and prudence,
which conititute the basis of every ref-
petanble charadter s to virtue, to good
temper, to Readines~s of affeAion; and
according to the union of those difpofi-
tions, esteem yourselves happy in the
friend whom you chufe.

In the second place, I mull admonish

you not to be hurt by differences of opi-
nion arising in intercours~e with your
friends. It is impofr~ble forthe'e not to
occur. Perhaps no two persons were
ever cast so exadtly in the fame mould, as
to think always in the fame manner, on
every fubjea. It was wif~ely contrived by
Providence, that diversity of s~entiment
thould take place among men, on purpose
to exercis~e our faculties, and to give varie-
ty to human life. Perpetual uniformity
of thought would become monotonous
and infipid.--When it is with regard to

trifles

nions Ifhows idfelf, it is chil~dith in the laR i
degiree if this becomie the gro~und of
elhan~ged affe-;~ion. When from fch a
cadie there arises anyr breach of friend-
ihip, hutman weakness· is then diitcovered
in a mortifyiig light. In Ihatters of fe-
rious moment, the feaitiments of the best
and worthiest mary vary from those of
their friends, according as thieir lines of
life diverge, or as their temper, and ha-
bits of thoughtr, preientr ob~jeds under
diffierent points of view. But among
candid and liberal minrds, unihty Ofaffece-
tion will filil be preferr~ed. No man has
any title to erea his own~s opinions into
an universal~ and Infalible itand~ard; sAnd
the more' enlarged that any rnan~'s· mind
is, the more readily he will overlooki
difference in s~entiments, as long as he is
perfunded that the minzd of his friendc is
upright, and that he ~followS the ditastes
of co~nscience arid~ integrity.

Vox.. IV. le

SER M. IN the ttird place, It is material to

_the pres~ervation of friendship, that

openner's of temper and manners, on
both hands, be cultivated. Nothing
more certainly dissolves friendship, than
the jealousy which ar~igts from darkness
and concealment. If your situation
oblige you to take a different fide from
your friend, do it openly. Avow your
conduft s avow your motives 3 as far as
Hionour allows, difeclof~e yourselves frank-
ly; seek no cover from unnecessary and
myfierious secrecy. Mutual confidence
is the foul of friendship. As soon as
that is destroyed, or even impaired, it is
only a show of friendship that remains.
What was once cordial intimacy, dege-
nerates firit into formal civility. Con-
firaint on both sides next s~ucceeds; and
disgust or hatred soon follow.--The
maxim that has been laid down by cer-
tain crooked politicians, to behave to a
friend with the fame guarded caution ar
we would do to an enemy, becaufi
it is pofirble that he may one day be-
come furch, discovers ·amind wjhich neve:

was made for the enjoyments of friend- S ER M;
thip.., It is a maxim which, not unrea- xvuT.
fonably I admit, may find~ place in those
political and party friendships, of which
I before ifpoke, where personal advance-
meent is always, in view. But it is alto-
gether inconsistent with the spirit of thos~e
friendships, which are formed, and un-
derflood to be nourished, by the heart.

THE fou~rth advice which I giv e is;

To cultivate, in all intercourse among
friends, gentile and obliging manners.
It is a common error to s~uppose, that
familiar intimacy s~upersedes attention to
the lesser duties of behaviour s and that,
under the notion of freedom, it may
excuire a carelets, or even a rough, de-
meanour.. On the contrary, an intimate
conne~tion canl only be kept up, by a
conflant with to be plearing and agreea-
ble. .The nearer and closer that men
are brought together, the more frequent
that the points of contadt between them
become, there is the greater necessity*
-for the surface being iimooth, and every

Aaz thing

_,fend.--Let no harthn~efs, no appearance
of neglea, no furperciliorus aAFe~aston of
su~periority, occur in the intercours~e of
friends. A tart reply, a proneness to re-
buke, a captious and contradiaious spirit,
are often known to embitter domneffic
life, and to et friends at variance. In
those finaller articles of behaviour,
where men are too apt to be careleifs,
and to indulge their humour without
re~raint, the real charader is often un-

It is by no means enough, that, in all

IN the f4xtht and last place, let me ex-

hort you not to. des~ert your friend in
danger or diffref~s. Too many there are
in the world, whose attachment to thofel
they call their friends is confined to the
day of their prosperity. As long as
that contimses, they are, or appear to be,
affeAionate and cordial. But as soon
as their friend is under a cloud, they
begin to withdraw, and to s~eparate their
intereits· from his. In friendships of
this fort, the heart, affuzredly, has never
had much concern. For the great test
of true friendihip, is conflancy in the
hour of danger, adherence in the season
of :diftreis.--When your friend is ca-
lumniatedt, then is the time, openly
shd ·boldly to efpoute his cause.
When his situation is changed, or his
fortunes are falling, then is the time of

affording

affording prompt and zealous aid. When S ER Mn.
sickness or infirmity occasion him to be. V.
neg'le~ed by others, that is the opportu-
nity which every real friend will s~eize,
of redoubling all the affeaionate atte~n-
tions which love suggests. There are
the important duties, the sacred claims
of friendship, which religion and virtue
enforce on every worthy mind.--To
thow yourselves warm, after this man-
ner, in the cause of your friend, com-
mands esteem, even from thos~e who·
have personal: interest in oppoiing him.
This honourable zeal offriendfhip, has,
in every age, attradled the veneration of
mankind.. It ·has consecrated to the
latest polkbrity the names of those who
have given up their fortunes, and have
even expo~sed their lives,, in behalf of
the friends whom they loved ; while ig-
nominy and disgrace ha~ve- ever been the

course of the: proper condua which xvmI.

we ought to hold with regard to futu-
rity, anxidRt the present uncertainties of
life. Time and life are always going
on, and to each of us are preparmng
changes m our Rate. What there may
be, whether for the better or for the
worse, we cannot tell ; as it hath pleas~ed

the

S ER M. the wisdom of providence to cover futu-

.VI rity with a veil which no mortal can

lift up. In the mean time, none of us
can avoid forming designs, and laying
plans for the time to come. The present
moment is never f~ufficient to give full
employment to the aaive mind of man,
without some excursions into futurity;
and in thes~e excursions, the present is
often wholly s~pent. It is therefore of
the highest confeiquence, that a proper
direation be given to the mind, in its
employments of thought relating to fu-
turity. Otherwis~e, in the profpeats
w~hich we take of that unknown regio~n,
false hopes, or ill-grounded fears, thall
flatter or tormnent: us in vain. W7e knowe
nlot, as the WIife Man tells us, wheat a
da~iy ma~y bring forth. It may, very pro-
bably, produce fomlething that we had
not looked for; and~ therefore initead of
bo~afing ourfelues of ~a~tomor~~ttt~~~tro, as the
multitude are apt to do, it becomes us
to be dis~ciplined and. prepared, for what-
ever it may bring.

~IT

Pr is needles~s to [~pend much time in S ER M.

confirming the truth, which is the foun- XUL
-dation ors the admonition in the text s in
proving, either that change and muta-
bility belong to our present Rtate, or that
~the changes of it cannot be fores~een by
us. ThefCe are truths to obvious and con-
sessed, than an attempt to confirm them
is like proving, that all men are to die.
At the fa~me time, obvious as they are,
it were to be withed that the thoughts
of men dwelt uponl them more. For,
by a firange but prevailing deception,
it would se~em, from the gene~ral conduat
of mankind, that almnoft every one thinks
his own cafe an exception fr~om the ge-
neral law s and that he may build plans
with as much confidence on his present
situation, as if some affhrance had: been
given him that it were never to change.
Hence it has been often obse~rved by fe-
riouts persons, that there is no more ge-
neral cadfe to which the vices of men
can be aferibed, their forgetfhlne~s of '
God, and their negled of duty, than to
their presuming upon the continuance

of

SXE ~R M.os life, of pleasure, and prosperity.

,Look but a little way, my friends,

into your own itate s and you muff una-
voidably perceive that, from the begin-
ning, it has been so contrived by Provi-
dence, that there thould be no perma-
nent flability to man's condition on
earth. The feeds of alteration are every
where sown. In your health, life, pof-
tefli~ons, connettions, pleasures, there are
causes of decay imperceptibly working;
secretly undermining the foundations of
what appears to you the most flable;
continually tending to aboliih the pre-
s~ent form of things, and to bring for-
ward new appearances, and new objeats
in their order : So that nothing is or can
be, flationary on earth. All changes,
and passes. It is afiream which is ever
flowing; a wheel which is ever turning
round. When you behold the tree co-
vered with blossoms in the spring, or
loaded with fruit in the autumn, as well
may you imagine, that thos~e blossoms, or
that fruit, are to remain in their place

through

through the whole year, as believe that S ER M.
human affairs are to continue, for to day ,xvil.
and to-morrow, for this year and the
next, proceeding in the fame tenor.--
To render this refle~t~ion it~ill more feri-
ous, think, I pray you, on· what i-mall
and inconsiderable causes thos~e changes
depend, which asseRt the fortunes of
men, throughout their whole lives.
How soon is evil done ! There needs
no great buffle or fkir, no long prepara-
tion of events, to overturn what fteems
most fCecure, and to blast what appears
moss flourithing. A gale of wind rif'es
on the ocean s and the vessel which
carried our friends, or our fortunes, is
overwhelmed in the deep. A spark of
a candle falls by night in some negleated
corner; and the whole s~ubstance of fa-
milies is cons~umed in flames before. the
morning. A casu~al blow, or a sudden
fall, deranges some of our internal parts;
and the reft of life is diffrefis and misery.
It is awful to think, at the mercy of
how many s~eeming contingencies we

perpetually ·

ER M. perpetuaally lie, for what we call hap-
~xvm.; pinef~s in this world.

In the inidfk, however, of al these

apparent contingencies, plans and de-
signs for the future are every day
formed; purs~uits are undertaken; and
life proceeds in its ufuzal train. Fit and
proper it is, that life thould thus proceed.
Fior the uncertainty of to-morrow was
never designed by Providence, to deter
us frorn a~ting or planning to day ; but
only ·toadmonith us, that we ought to
plan, and to sa, -soberly and wifely.
Wbhat that: wife and sober condu& is
which becomes us, what the rules and
precautions are, which, in such a slate
as ours, refped futurity, I now proceed
to t~hews. They may be comprehendbed
in the following dire~tions. Boast not
thyself of to-morrow 3 Delpair not of to-
morrow; Delay not till to-morrow what
is proper to be done to-day; Prepare thy-
f'elf for wh3atever to-morrow may bring
forth; Build thy hopes of happiners on
something more solid and laiting than

what

what either to-day or to-morrow willSER M.
produce. fj5

L. la the words of the text, Boa/7 not

tkyelf of to~morrow ; that is, never pre-
foune arrogaspy on futurity; in thy
moit fair and promiiing Rtate of fortune,
b~eware of pride and vanitjy; beware of
reting wholly upon yours~elves, and
forgetting Him who direas the changes
of this mutable Rate. If there be any
virtues, which the uncer tain, condition
of the world inculcate on man, they
are atiuredly, moderation and humility.
Man was, for this end, placed in a
world, where he knows to, little of what
is before him, ·that ·he ~might be im-
preifed with a .sense of his dependence
on the Ruler of the world; that he
might feel the importance of acquiiring
favour and proteaion from Heaven, by
a life of piety and virtue; s nd that, not
knowing how soon his ow~n condition
may be the fame with that of the nxaAt
wretched, he might be prompted toadt

written on all human pleafiixes.

As for them who, intoxicated with

thof'e pleafurezs, become giddy and in-
solent; who flattered by the illusions of
pros~perity, make light of every s~erious
admonition which the- changes of the
world give them, what can I f~ay too
£1rong to alarm them of their danger ?
--They have thid to themselves, Mly

produative both of much fin, and
much misery. It aas as acorrofive of

refpeaing futurity, is compounded of
them both; requiring us, neither ar-
rogantly to pres~ume on to-morrow,
nor to be anxiously, and fearfully s~oli-
citous about it. 'The morro~w, says our

art to far from having any title to

rant of the most material circu~m-
stances relating to it s not only of
what it shall bring forth, but whe-
ther thou thalt live to fee it.- Notl
wvithftanding the uncontrovertible evi-
dence of this truth, procraffination
has, through~out every age, been the
ruin -of mankind. Dwelling amidst
endless projeats of what they are herel
after to do, they cannot so properly be
said to live, as to' be always about to
live; and the future has ever been the
gulph in which the pre~e~nt is s~wallow-

ranged at al. To-inorrow being load-
ed with the concerns of to-dayi, in ad-
dition to its own, is clogged and em-
harraffed. A~ffairs which had beens
postponed, multiply and crowd upon
one another.; till, at last~, they prove
so intricate and perplexed, and the
preirure of business becomes to great,
that nothing is left, but to fink under
the burden. Of h~im, therefore, whoP
indulges this lingering and delaying

progrnofficate that the ruin is not far

whatever to-morrow may bring forth.
There is a certain preparation for the
viciflitudes of life, in which the multi-
tude are fufficiently busied; providing,
as they think, against whatever may
happen, by increasing their riches, and
firengthening thems~elves by friends,
connedions, and worldly honours. But

must look for our defence ; for when it xvill.
is the world itifelf, whol~e changes we
have reason to dread, the world, and
the things of it, cannot affbird us pro-
te~tion. 'The beit preparation for all
the uncertainties offuturity consists, in
a well ordered mind, a good conscience,
and a chearful s~ubmission to the will of
Heaven. You know not w~ihat thall
be on to-morrow. .But there is One
who knows it well s for his decree hath
fixed it. To him look up with reve-
rence ; and fay, " Not my weill, but thzine
" be done ; what thou appointeft is ev~er
" wifie, and juff, and good." Seek to
fulfil the part which he hath assigned
you 3 to do the things which he hath
commanded you to do ; and leave all the
refitohim. Whatever to-morrowbrings
forth, let it find you employed in doing
jufly,· lovingl mercy, and wa~lking humbly
wreith youlr God ; and then you thall meet
to-morrow without fear, when you
meet it without the upbraidings of guilt.

If it thall bring forth to you any un.

expedted good, prepare to receive it.

Let no events of any kind, derange your
equanimity, or thake your constancy.
CZontradt your desires, and moderate
your hopes. Expe~t not more from
the world than it is able to afford you.
Take it for granted that what is natu-
rally mutable, will one day change;
that what was desig~ned to be transient,
will pass away.-Look forward to futu-
rity without impatience. Be not defir-
ous to know it. It belongs to God.
Let him bring forward the events of
the world, in his own way. Imagine
that you continually hear those words,

S E~X~· N this world, we are placed as camps.

A- nions and assistants to one another.
Depending, for most of the comforts of
life, on mutual intercourfejlandaid, it was
necessary, that we thould be formed to
desire the company, and to take pleafisre
in the good will of our fellows. But this
Sioci~~b~iliy of man, thou'gh elibutial to~his

pref~en condition, has, like many other SER a VI.
good principles, been unhappily warped ,XX~
from its original purpof'e; and, in the
present slate of the world, has proved
the caus~e of mruch evil. For, as vice has
abounded in every age, it. hath pro~pa-
gated itfeilfrnuch more easily by the afif~t-
ance of this social dif~polition. WYe natu-
rally mould osirfelves on the pattern of
prevailing manners 3 and corruption is
communicated from one ts another. By
mutually giving, and taking, the exam-
ple of finrful liberties, li~centiodhnefs
spreads and grows; each justifies him-
self by his neighbour 3 and the multitude
of sinners firengthen one another·'s
hands to commit iniquity. In all ages of
the world, cufltom has had more power

inquiring what is the right pat~hl
the greater part content themse~lves with

S ER 1M. the text ; Th~ou fkalt not followe a muclti-

xXx. tude to do evil,

To acquire a full vliewi of any danger

to whichwe are expofedi is the firff mea-
faure to be taken, in order to our fai~fety.
Let us then begin the faubjea, with con-
fidering how much we are in hazard of
being misled into vice by the general
mlanners which we behold around us.
No virtue is more necessary to a Chris-
tian, but fecarcely is there any more dif-
ficult to be put in pradtice, than that
firmness ofmrind whic~h can enable a manl
to maintain his principles, and to fland
his ground against the torrent of cuf-
tom,. fashion, and example. Example
haRs upon all minds a f~ecretr and infinu-
ating influence, even when we ourselves
are insensible of its operation. We im-
perceptibly slide into some resemblance
of the mariners of those with whom we
have frequent intercours~e. This often
shows itself, in the most indifferent
things. B3ut the resemblance is flill m~ore
readily contra~ted, when there is bfoile-

thing

thing within ourselves, that leans to the S ER M.
fame fide which is countenanced by the I,
pradice of others. We are always glad
to £2nd an apology for indulging our in-
clinations and passions; and the example
of the multitude too readily firggeits
that apology. Even before corruption
has made great progres~s in our hearts,
sometimes, mere complais~ance and good
nature incline us to fall in with the ways
of others. Sometimes, timidity and fals~e
ihame prevent our differifig from them:
Frequently, expeaation and interere im-
pel us firongly to comply. How great is
the danger we incur, when, in times of
prevailing vice, all there principles of
imitation and compliance unite together
aga~inst our virtue ?

The world is too juffly said by scrip.-

ture to lie in wreickedne/s. It is a school
wherein every vice is taught, and too
easily learned. Even from our earliedt
childhood, false sentiments are infililed
into our minds. We are bred up in ad-
miration of the external thow of life.
SWe are accutomed, as soon as we can

Cc 2 under~itand

S ER M. underfland any thing, to hear ri~ches and

,M.~ honours spoken of as the chief goods of

men, and propos~ed to us as the objeats
to which our future purs~uits are to be
direated. W~e fe~e the meas~ures of out-
ward ref~ped and deference taken from
there alone. Religion and virtue are
recommended to us, in a formal man-
ner, by our teachers and infiruaors; but
all improvements of th-e mind and heart,
are visibly placed by the world, in an
inferior rank to the advantages of for-
teune. Vices, that chance to be fafhi--
onable, are treated as flight failings ;and
coloured over, in common ditcourfe,
with those soft and gentle names which
express no condemnation. Wae enter,
perhaps, on the world, with good prin-
ciples, and an averflon todownright vice.
But whien, as we advance in lifeii, we be-
come initiated in that royfkery of ini-
quity, which is called, the way of the
wforld; when we meet wvith ~deceit and
artifice in all ranks of men; when we
behold iniq~uity auzthorifed by great
names, and oft~en rewarded wfith fuc-·

cess

cers and advancement, our original SEaRM.
good impressions too so~on decay. The
pradice of the medlti~tude renders vice
familiar to our thoughts; and gradually
wear-s off the abh-orrence with which we
once beheld it. We begin to think, that
what is to very general, cannot be highly
criminal. The malignity of fin appears
diminished, by so many being thar-ers inz
the reproach ; and inficad of men's vices
detrafting, as they ought to do, from
our g;ood opinion of the men, our at-
tachment to the men oftener reconciles
us to the vices of which they are guilty.

Trhe countenance which fin receives

from the pradtice: of the multitude, nlot
only removes the reffraints which are
imposed by modefl~y and thname; but,
fuzch is the degeneracy of the world,
that thame is too often employed against
the cause of religion and virtue. The
ridicule of the giddy and unthinking
bears d~own the conviftion of the sober
and modest. . Against their own belief,
they a~ppear to adopt, the notions of the
infidel sand against their own choice,

they

S ER M. they join in the vices of the libertine;

X'.that they may not be reproached as per-

sons of a narrow mind, and itill enslaved
to the prejudices of education. How
much reason is there to believe that,
merely from this timidity of temper,
many, whose principles are on the fide
of religion and virtue, are nevertheless
founld wzealking- in th2e wa~y of)9mzers, and
fitting" in th2e chiair of the /cornful ?--In-
teereft, too, often coincides with this
weakness of dilpofition, in tempting
sauch persons to follow the multitude.
To fall in withi the prevailing taite, to
suit thernfelves to the paflions of the
great, or -to the humours of the low,
wt~ith whom they chance to be connefted,
appears the readicit way to rife in the
world. Hence Fhey are naturally led
to relinquish the firmnnefs of an upright
charafter, for that Aupple and verfiable
turn, which accomnmodates itself to the
times, and ass~umes whatever appearance
feems' most convenient for 'intereft.
Such are the dangers to which we are
exposed, in times of corruption, of fol,

low ~in

loweing the mucltitucde to do evil; dangers SER IVI,
which require our moit serious atten- xxx..
tion and care, in order to guard ourselves
againit them.--I proceed to lay s~uch
coniiderations before you as may be use-
ful for that purpose.

IN the f~rf~ place. Let us remember

that the multitude are very bad guides;
aire to far from having a title to implicit
regard, that he who blindly follows
them, may be presumed to err. For
prejudice, and pafflon, are known to
ifway the crowd. They are itruck by
the outside of things; they inquire s~uper-
ficially, admire false appearances, and
purs~ue false goods. Thsir opinions are
for the moRt part hastily formed, and. of
course are variable, floating, and incon-
ifident. In every age, how fmnall is the
number of those who are guided by rea-
son, and calm inquiry ? How few do we
find, who have the wifdom-to think and
judge for themselves, and have Rteadi-
nef's to follow out their own judgment ?
Ignorance, and low education, darken

the

soS 1 . threvie wvs of th~e vulgar. Faf ion ·and

I,,prejudice, vanityi and pleasure, corrupt

the s~entiments of the great. T~he exam-
ple of neither, affords any flandard of
what is right and wifCe. I~f the philofo-
pher, when eniployed in the perfuit of
truth, finds it neces~sary to difriegard es-~
tablithed prejudices and popular op-inion,
Thall wte, in the moare important inquiry
after the rule of life, s~ubmit to such
blind guidance as the pradtice of the·
many; esteeming whatever they ad-
inire, and following wherever they lead ?
Be- afirued, that he who s~ets up the ge-
neral opinion as the flandard of truth, or
the general ptyatice as the meas~ure of
right, is likely, upon such a foundation,
to build no other ifuperitruture except
vice and folly. If the pr~Atice of the mul-
titude be a good pattern forf our imitation,
their opinions farely. thould be as good a
rujle for~ our belief. Upoqn this principle,
wre: m~ft esahanrge Christianity for Paga-
nifi or M~aht~or~netani~fm, sad the light of
the Reformat-cion for the~ Cuperititions of

Popery ;

Popery; for there latter have ever had, S ER IV.
and itill have; the numbers and the mul- xIX.
titude on their fide.-.-Our Saviour has
fixfficiently charad~erifed the way of the
world, when he deferibes the broad road
in which the multitudes go, as the road
whizck leads to defZ-Lrurlion and the path
wh~ich leads to happ-nei-s, as a narrow~
path5, which fewer find. ]From which
it is an easy inference, that to have the
muultitude on our fide, is to far fr-om as-
fording any. pres~umption of our being
s~afe, that it thould lead. us to fufp~ed that
\ve are holding the cours~e of danger.

IN the Jecond place, as the pradice of

the multitude is no argument of a good
pradtice, to it cannot affo~rd us either jus-
tif ication, or safety, in what is evil. -It
affords us, I fay, no juffification. Truth
and error, virtue and vice, are things of
immutable nature. The diffetrence be-
twieen them is grounded on that basis of
eternal reason, which no opinions or cui--
toms ofmen can affedt or alter. WShether

virtue

S ER M., virtue be eiteemed, or not, in the world,
, this makes it neither more nor les~s efti;

mable in its~elf It carries always a divine
authority, which men cannot impair. It
thines wiith an ess~ential luire, which
praise cannot brighten, nor reproach tar-
niflh. It has a right to regulate the opi-
nlions of men; but by their opinions can-
lo t be controlled. I[ts nature continues
in~variably the fam~e, though all the mul-
titude of fools thould concur in endea-
vouring to turn it into ridicule. We ucn-
to the~m, says th~e prophet ZIfaiah that~
call ev~il, good, and good, evil; that put
darknfs for Ight, ad~ ighit for dar~kne/s;
thsat put bitter for/w~eet, ~zandfieet for bit-
ter.-Thleir root./hanll be as rottenness,
and thleir blojamirs fallgo up as dul/Z; be-
cauf~ they, haw cazji away thie lazw of the
Lord of hzofs, and de/piJed thze ieoord of the
holy one o~f Ijrael*.

As the practice of the multitude fur-

nifhes,

*L Iraiah v. 20, 24.

nithes no justification to the finner, so SER M.
neither does it afford him any f~afety.,XX:
Religion is altogether a matter of per-
fonal concern. God hath delivered to
every man the rule of life; and every
man muff think and aBt for himself;
because for himself he is to anfiver. If
others be wicked, it will be the worse
for them; but it will not on that ac-
count, be the better for us, if we thall
be evil also. Let vice be ever so pre-
valent, it is flill. that evil thing~ wh~ichi the
Lord aborarseth s and th0ughl hand join in
hand, the wicked shall not escape un-
punished. So far is the number of of-
fenders from furnishing~ any ground of-
s~afety, that it calls more loudly for divine
juffice to interp~ose. It is as easy for
the Almighty arm to cruih a whole
guilty society, as to punish a single in-
dividual; and when the disobedient A~b-
jects of God countenance and firengthen
one another in lric~entioufnefs, by tranf-
grefr~ng in troops an~d bands, it becomes
-hig-h time for his government to exert
itself, and let its verigeance forth.-One

could.

SEiR M. could fearcely think that any profeffor of

_; Christian faith would fancy to hiniiblf

any a~pology from the way of the wjorld,
when he knowrs that the declared design
of his religion was, to diftinguth him
from the= world, which is said to lie in/insa
and that Christ came to call out for him-
s~elf a ~peculliar people, whlole chara~ter it
thould be, nzot to be conformed to the wrork/,
b~ut transformed by the re~newzeing ojf thzeir
minzds.--So little, indeed, can the prac-
tice of the: world either justify or exte-
nuate vice, that it des~erves our s~erious
consideration .

In thle thir'gd place, whether there be

not several circumstances, which peculi-
arly aggravate the guilt of thos~e who
follow th~e multitude in evil. Do you
not, thereby, firengthen the power of
fin, and perpetuate the pernicious
influence of bad example ?By firiking
off from the corrupted cro~wd, you
might be eminently useful. You
might animate and recover many,
w4homl weakness and timidity keep

undeS

under bondage to the cuffoms of the sERa M.
world s whereas, by tamely yielding to
the current of vice, you render that cur-
rent fironger for carrying others along;
you add weight and stability to the bad
cause; you lend to the multitude all the
force of your example, for drawing
others after them, to the commifilon of
evil.--While you are thus accessary to
the ruin of others, you are, at the fame
time, stamping your own charad2er with
the foulest and deepest imprefflons of
corruption. By s~urrendering your judg-
ment and your conscience to the multi-
tude, you betray the rights, and degrade
the honour of the rational nature.
Nothing great or worthy can be expea-
ed of him, who infitcad of consi-dering
what is right in itself, and what part it
is fittest for one in his flation to aLe, is
only considering what the world will
thjnk, or fay of him; what fort of beha-
viour will' pas~s with the fairest show,
and be moss calculated to please the ma-
ny. When a man~ha~s thus given up the

liberty

8 E R M. 1iberty and independence of his mind, we
XI X Scan no longer reckon upon him in any

thing. W~e cannot tell how far he may
be carried in vice. There is too much
ground to dread, that he will lie, diffem-
ble, and betray s changing himself, with-
out scruple, into every thape that will
find favour among those whom he seeks
to gain.-While this servility to the
world infers baseness~ towards men, it
involves also the highest impiety to-
wards God. It ihows that we yield to
the wor-ld that reverence and f~ubmiflion
which is only due to the divine law.
W6e treat the government of the Al-
mighty with s~corn; as if his precepts
deserved to be obeyed, only when they
fiaited the caprice and the follies of the
multitude 3 and were entitled to no re-
gard, as soon as they contradiCaed the
reigning cuffoms and fashions of the
world.-W-hile such conduat carries in
it so much wickednes~s and folly, let us
observe,

IN the fourthL place, that the moit ex-

cellexit and honourable charadter wvhich

ca~n

can adorn a man andB a Chrifiaint it SER M.
acquired, b'y resisting the torrenrt of vice, ,Xx
and adhering to the cause of G~od and
virtue againn: a corrupted multitude.
It will be found to hold in general, that
all those, who, in any of the great lines
;of life, have djitinguifhed thems~elves for
thinking profoundly, and a(5ting nobly,
have despis~ed popular prejudices, and
departed, in s~everal things, fr-om the
·common ways of the world. On no
occasion is this more requisite for trtue
honour, than where religion and mora-
lity are concerned. In times of prevailing
licentiouf~neis, to maintain unblemithed
virtue, and uncorrupted integrity; in a
public or a private caus~e, to fland firm
by what is fair and juff, amidib· dif'cou-
ragements and opposition s despising
groundlefi centure and reproach; dif-
daining all compliance with public
manners, when they are vicious and
dnin j~ful; and never ashamed of
the punctual dikcharge of every duty
towards G~od and man; '-tis is whit
shows true greatners of spirit, and will
force approbation even from the dege-

nerate

SER M. ne rate multitude themselves. "~ This is

xIXx << the man," their conscience will oblige

them to acknowledge, ** whom we are
** unable to bend to mean condef~cenii-
rc ons. W~e f~ee it in vain either to flat-
** ter or to threaten him? he rests on a
** principle within, which we cannot
" thake. To this man you may, on
" any occasion, safely commit your
ac cause~. He is incapable of betraying
(( his truss, or des~erting his friend, or
c' denying his faith." Thus hisr righte-
oufSnefj comes forth as thre light, anzd hisE-
jurdgment as th2e noon-day.

It is, accordingly, this iteady inflexible

virtue, this regard to principle, superior
to all cuffom and opinion, which pecu-
liarly marked the chara~ters of those, in
any age, who have ihone as faints or
heroes; and has consecrated their me-
mory to all posterity. It was this that

they by the deluge were swept away;
while on him, Providence con;ferrled the
immnortal honouwr, of being the reiforer
of a· better race, and the father of a new
world. Such exam~ples as ther'e, and s~uch
'h Rurs conferred by God on them
who withlrood the multitude of evil
doers, thould Often be pr~eset to our
minds. Let us oppo~ l~e th to the

For the versatility of charader, the

chased by dithonourable means, can be

reverence is the foundation of religion. c
All the divine perfe~tions are interest-

ficent to confound ,the atheiit, and to
as ford the candid obse~rver endles~s mate-
rials of devout adoration and praise.

WtHEN we return to the moral world,

the field of admiration which opens to
us is no less~ extensive and itriking. I
can only mention a few initances of
that exquisite wisdom which every-
where meet: us.

In the fir} place, let us attend to

the connitution of human nature.
Though we are taught by revelation,
to confider it as now impaired by the
fall, yet, as it itands, we behold the
traces of a noble itruaure, planned and
executed with the highest fkcill. All
the powers and faculties be~fowed on
man are such as perfeely fauit his condi-
tion, and adapt him to the purpofies for
which he was defigned.--Senfes were
given him, that he might dii~inguith
what is necefrary for the preservation
and welfare of his body. Now, s~up-

pose

pore that any one of those senses, the S E RM.
fight, for inflance, or the hearing, or ~X-
the touch, had been in a considerable
degree either more blunt, or more
acute, than it is at pres~ent, what an
unhappy change would this have made
urpon our slate ? on the one hand,
greater imperfe~tio~n of the organs,
would have deprived us of all the com-
fort and advantage which we now en-
joy from such powers. On the other
hand, a greater degree of exquisite fen-
fibility in them, would have rendered
life a burden to us. Our s~enses, in-
Rtead of being inlets to knowledge and
pleasure, would then have become con-
AZant avenues to uneatinef~s and pain
Their powcers, therefore, are fkrilfully
adjuffed to that meafare of itrength,
which allows them to answer the pur-
poses of health, s~afety, and comfort s
without either falling thior t of this line
of uf~efulnefs, or improperly, and hurt-
fully itretching beyond it.

tions and follies, are by him rendered
fthbfervient to dfeful ends.- Amidst
thos~e inequalities of condition, for in-
flance, wh·ich the Rtate of hualzan life
required, where it was necessary that
some thould be rich, and others poor,
that some thould be eminent and diftin-
guifhed,, and others obs~cure and mean,
how s~easonable is that good opinion
which every one entertains of himse~lf 3
that felf-complacency with which he
compares hims~elf to others; and that
fond hope, which is ever pleasing him
with thle profpeat of future pleasures
and advantages in life ?Without thos~e
flattering fenf~iations, vain as they often
are, how totally ins~upportable would
this world become, to many of its in-
habitants ? Whereas, by means of
theim, Providence hath contr ~ed to
balance, in a great mneaf~ure, the ine-
qualities of ·condition among mankind.
It hath contrived to diffule pleathure
thr~ough all ranks; and to bring· the
high and the low nearer to ndevel with

each

each other, than might at firit be s~up- sE R M.
posed. It hath smoothed the most xx.,
rugged tradis of human life; and hath
gilded with rays of borrowed light its
mos1 dreary s~cenes.

One infkance of Divine wisdom, in

framing our nature, is to remarkable as
to demand particular attention ; that is,
the meathure according to which, God
hath dis~pens~ed knowledge and igno-
rance to man. There is nothing of
which we are more ready to complain,
than of our narrow and confined views
of nature, and of Providence, and of
all things around us : And yet, upon
exam~ination, it will be found, that our
views extend- on every fide, juff as far
as they ought 3 and that, to fee and
know more than is allowed us, inficad
of bringing any advantage, would pro-
duce certain misery *.-We pry, for
inflanch ~4with impatient curiolity, into
future events. Happily for us, they are
Ireiled and covered up; and one peep

manner, we often with with eag~erners

to look into the invisible world, and to
be made acqluainted with the whole de-
itay of man. Our w·ith is denied 3 we
are environed on all hands with myfte-
ry; and that mystery is our happiness.
For were those great invisible objeats
fully difelofed, the fight of them would
confound and ov'erwh~elm us. It would
either totally derange our feeble facul-
ties; or would engross our attention to
fa~ch a degree, as to lay us aside from
the b A~inels and concerns of this w~orld.
It would have the f~amie effeat, as if
we were carried away from the earth,
and mingled among the inlyibitants
of some other planlet. -Th know-~N
ledge3 that is allowed to us, was de-
figed to fit us for ggrag our· part in'

plate the fame wisd;om, as exh~ibiting it-
fCelf to us in the moral government of

dance to ·be an introduory part of ex-
iftence to intell-igent -beings; a, slate of
edtucation and discipline, where crea-
tures -allen from their original rank,
may gr ~ally recover their redtitude
and~virtue. Und~er this -view, which
is in htfelf perife~~tly~confonbr ant to all that

nreral course of human~ affairs, confused
as it may -'lEmnetimels appear, to have

sER M.been ordered with exquisite wis~dom.

~S~ -- It was necessary to such a slate,

that all the aaive powers of man thould
be brought for th into exercis~e, and com-
pletely tried. It became proper, there.
fore, that there thould be a m~ixture of
charadters in the world; and that men
thould be thewn in a variety of fitua-
tions*. H~ence that diversity of tempers
and, difpolitions which are found in so-
ciety; those inequalities in r~ank andl fla-
tion, which we fee taking place s and
thos~e different talents and inclinatide-s
which prompt men to different pur-
faits. By there means, every depa~rt-
ment in society is filled up 3 and every
man has some sphere prepared for him,
in1 which he can ae. ~He is brought
forth as on a busy stage, where oppor-
tunity is given for his charadter to dif-
play itself fully.--His life is w~ith great
propriety, varied by inter nges .of
prosperity and adversity. Always prof-
perous, he would become dil~ipated,
indolent, and giddy : Always afifliied,

"Se~e~.L~.~T~,lc ulhe

he would be fretful, dejeaed, and ful- SE RM.
len. There are few persons, therefore, xx.
or none, whofie lot thares not of both
there slates; in order that every d~ifpo-
fition of the heart may be explored, and
every mean of improvement afforded.
--As man is ultimately designed for a
higher slate ofexiffence thap the pre-
sent, it was not proper that this world
thould prove a paradiife to him, or
thould afford him that. complete fatis-
fadion which he incessantly pursues.
Disappointments, therefore, are often
made to ·blast his hopes; and, even
while the comforts of life 1aft, they are
always mixed with f~ore troubles ; in
order that an excefiv~e attachment to
this world may gradually be loos~ened.
The courf'e of things is evidently so or-
dered by Providence, that occurrences
thall be always happening, to bring
down mos1 prosperous to a level
with the -reit of his brethren, and to
raise up in their tur~n, the low and the
diffre~ffed.

~fJwhich are to obviously conducive to

improvement, both wisdom and good-
ness required, that the supreme Gover-
nor of the world thoul~d be seen to pro-
tedt the intereits, and favour the fide
of virtue. But in the degr~eeof evi-
dence, wvith which this was to be thown,
it was-no less requilite, that a proper
temperament thould be obler~ved. Hfiad
virtue been always compketely reward-
ed, and made happy on earth, men
would no longer have had a motive ·for
aspiring to a more blessed dtate. In ~the
cafe of every crime, had divine justice
interposed t~o bring complete punish-
ment on the head of the criminal s or
had all the felicity which is prepared
for the juit in a future world, -and all
the misery which there -awaits the=
wicked, been ·already difpayed to the
view, and rendered s~ensible td~e feel-
ings of men, there would have beenan
end of that Rtate of trial, for wh~ich our4
Swhole condition on earth was iat~ened.
It was necessary, th~erefore, that, at

present,

prefea~t, we Ibould fee throurgh a glef' sER M.
dar-kly. A certain degree of mystery and ,LX
obsc~urity was, with perfea· wiifdom,
left on the conded of the Almighty*. -
But, amidst: that obscurity, f~ufficient
encouragement and support is in the
mnean time given to virtue; i tfficient
ground is afforded for the full belief,
that it is what the Deity loves, and
vill finally reward. His approbation:
of it is fiignifie440f every man by the
voice of con~science. Inward fatPisfa~taion
and peace a~re made always to belong to
it 3 and general esteem and ho~nour, for
the most part, to attend it. On the
other hand, the wicked, in no situation,
of life, are allowed to be truly happy.
Their vices and their pa~ffons are made
to trouble their prosperity; and their
punithment to grow out of their crimes,

they had deserved; their iniquities to

It is the power of God, which pro-

duces among the-multitude ·of men any
impreflions ~of religion. When thun-
de~r roars in the heavenls, or an earth-
quake Thakes the ground, they are
itruck with awe, and disposed to wor-
thip an invisible power. But such im-
prelrions of Deity are occaiional, and
transitory. The lasting reverence of a
Suprem~e Being arises, in a well inform-

fents. Its operations are conitantly,
though silently, g~oing on around us.
