Your Letter Astonished me beyond measure. How or about what should Rousseau have had the Occasion to show Malignity towards you, his Guide and his Benefactor? [. . .] He must be a very sad fellow; and it gives me great pain that he should turn out so. But for Gods sake do not be in a haste in publishing any thing about him. Nothing but Necessity should oblige you to this. You know the ill natured pleasure the world enjoys in a Paper war between two persons of such fame and eminence as you & him. Both parties often suffer in such personal Contests; & how clear soever the right may be on your Side, yet Envy to you will raise Partizans for him. You will see many reasons for deliberating very cooly concerning this Step; and perhaps too you may in part have been imposed upon by reports which may have aggravated some thing in his Conduct [. . .] .
