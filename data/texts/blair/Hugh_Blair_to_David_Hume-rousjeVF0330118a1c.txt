Edinburgh 4 June

. . . I have been favoured with both your Letters which gave us as Complete an Account as could be desired of Rousseau. There seems to me no small Affinity betwixt that Wild philosopher & your correspondent whom you mention immediately after him, Mass D. Dickson. Both of them in the midst of all their madness & outrage have always some Squint regard to their own Interest. D. Dickson has played several cunning tricks to avoid Deposition & retain his stipend; & Rousseau will rather renounce his Memoirs than quit his pension. He is now I think fairly finished; & with respect to yourself, you need neither mind him nor his productions any more. He is a curiosity; but a humbling one for human genius. The most Eloquent writer of the Age, But one of the most contemptible men in it. . . .
