REi. 2 3. a . !8494

THE citizens of Edlinbhurgh partake of one quallt-

ty in common with the reft of the people of Scoti-

lland, which is, that they are naturally fubmillive to the
laws, and refpt·~tful to their governo-s.--When, there-
forle, we oblerve, at any timne, a fa~tious spir~it r-ifng
amiong them; when thiere is an alarm takten about pii
leges, and a dilcontent wvith their rulers prevailing: to any
dtegree, we may be certain, either that the objeat is
grea~t, which hais awakened the attention of' the peo~ple,
and put them in a bad temper; or else thait the flamre is
artificial, and that it receives fuel from the intrigues
and feditions~ pra~tice~s of a palrty. If' the sirs1 is the cafec,
it is the duty ofi every goo~d citize~n to join in support of the
common caule r if the fccond, it is as certainly his dtuty
to fland by the legial adlminit~ration, and~ do every thing
in his power to dlifappoint faaltouis ambition.

The late measure of the Magiffrates and Town-council,

in granting a prelentation to the Reverend~ M~r Dry/2btle
to be one of their Miniffers, is the occall~on of th-e pre-
sent flame in the City. The following representation of
fa~ts, it is hoped, wiill enable every fober-minded citizen
to discover whether this flame is natural or artificial, and
deter-mine him to take part according to the- conv·tio of·- C
h~is own reason.

The ~fr/? thing that falls to be flaited and considered,

is thie right of patronage illelf; which is eftablirlhed la
th~is manner.

B~y a charter gralnted by kting Charle~s I. dated 22d1 /c-

tober I 6~36, ulpon which infeftment followed, Tbc Lord
Prove//,~, /IElaira~''lte2cS, and~ Councril, hve tbc utndoubrtedl

hir-ks built or to be built withinz the famze. In consequence
of which charter, they exercised that right, in a great
variety of inilances, fr-om the date thereof to the year
r649, and from the year r660 to the Revolution, pe-
riods when th-e law of patronage was in force. It would
be tedious to mention all the famous names of that age,
that are upon the- lift of those presented by the city of
Edlinbu~rgh during there periods; but Mr Alexan~der Hen-
decfon, Mr George- Gillefpic, Mr Jamnes Dulrham, Mr An-
dtrew Cant, Mr Riobert B3ruce, are among them.

It is true, that since the I oth year of queen Annez,

when the right of patronage was reflored, the Mvagi-
firlates and Council have not prelented to their vacant
churches, but have admitted the Miniffers and Elders to
a~n equal vote with themselves in the ele~tion of Minifiers :
and had reason to be 10 well pleased with that method,
thatt in the year 17 20, they entered into articles of agree-
me-nt with the prelbytery, expressly eflablithing that for-m
of eleaion ; but Gnding, in prqcefs of time, that en-
croachments were making upon them, and their indulgence
was in danger of being much abuled, they r-ailed a pro-
ces~s of redu~tion and declarator, againf1 the prelby tery
of ECdinbu~rgh, the Miniffers of this City, and the G~ene-
ral-efilions; in which, after a long debate, the Lord Or-
dinary appointed the minutes to be printed, allowed in-
formnations tobe given in, and took the cause to report;
and the Lords of Council and Seflion, on the 14tly
Februalry 17 3o, pronounced judgment, reducintg, de-
cerningt, anld declaring the r-ules anzd egulations betwixt
the Ma~gistrates and oronII-counlcil, anld the Prreybytery of
Edinburgh, on the one annd other palrts, relating to the se~tt-
ling anld tran/lating of` ingllters in and to Edinburgh,
dated the f·cond of November xy 20, and haill aErt
app:rovmgS thereof, to havle bceen from, the beginlnin~g, to be
thenI, and in aill timle comin~g, null1, and of no avail, force,
fitrength, or efea,~i and2 to bear no faSith inz jurdgmntc7, nor
crutwrith the Amr~e i.· timeP coninng; andz founld antd de'-
claredn the Lord Frov/?, Magi/lratess and Toron-council of

Edinburgh

Edinburgh to have the onzgy rqight of pr-e/'enting ~inlersii~r
to all the vancanlt churrcheLs budit or to beL built with~inl the
City.

The poin~t of right, then, is so3 clealrly eflab iflhed by

the original charter, by the exercise of it in forty or
fifty inflances, while the law of patrronage was in force,
and by an exprcls decree of the Lords of Counicil and
SefiTon, after a long aind formal debate by parties on eit'her
fide, since thle revival of that law, that no ma~n, who
had the least aIccefs to be informed, would have ventuired
to call it in qluelion, if he had not truffed to the criculity
of a party Ipirit for ready belief.

The next thing to be considered is, the manner of

giving the prelentation. For if' anyt informality thould be
made evident there, the validity of the deed wtould~ be
destroyed : or if no fuich informality (hould be found, yct:
if any guile or artiface tho~uld appear in the procedure,
it might juffly raill indignation against the conducctors
of it.

Immediately after, or rather before th-e death of Dr

H~yndin~an, in the month of dugu/Z Ii as, warm fo:icitations
wer~e begun, and carried on in foch a manner, in ord~er to
influence thcKirk-feflions, and le-cure their votes for a par-
ticular perfemn, as plainly indicated, that no regar~d what-
ever was to be paid to the fentimeonts of the Maoit~rates
and T~own-council, thiough undoubte~d patrons of all the
churches in the City. Freq~uent experience had~ formerly
proved the pernicious tendency of fa~ch folic~itations; and
'the Magiffrates and Council had good caule: to be alarmed,
as will afterwards be (hown, at such a notorious abde; of
their lenity and ind ulgence. The Convecner of the trades,
at an ordinary meeting of the Council on the I ft of Dccen2-
bEr lalf, reprelented, T'hat havingi hadf a meecting that mor-
ping in Goldfitnihs Hall with his b~rethren, he was deire~d
by themn, to request the Council to take luch meafo~rcs as
appeared to them molk proper, for allaying the hieats andi
animolities that wer~e alread~y Lceun in the City, and weree

p~retended to have heard the L~ord Prlovoff- fay so,. Then,
upon maturer reed/liclionr, the gendemaln; admmedc~c, that it
stras not the Lord P'rovof1, but lamne other·1 pcrion, who
had said 10, at the Lord Provoft's delihe; or, at len~t,
that some body had g~iven outt, of his own1 aICCOrdC, e~ither
that there was to be no Council that day, or thait th~e Los &
Provof1 was not to be there. In (hort, this flory t(ook a~
riew form every day; and such wa~s the credulity of th~e
public,.that, in eve~ry form in which it atppearedc, it gainil-
ed credit with lome. But nothing can better Jemonitrate
]how much the good citizens are impaled onl by a spi-rit of`
fa~tion, or ought to put them more on their guanrd soT thle
future, than the prevalency of this absurd report. For let;
it be observed, that this meeting of Council was a regu~l;ar
slated meeting, held in the ordinary place, and on the
7tcl~led~neay, the ordlinalry dlay of meeting throughout th~e
year. If, by anly accident, it is foresee~n, that ther~e is to
be no meeting oni this slated day, billets are regular~ly ftnt,
some time before, to warn every indlividual memnber not
to attend. But, in the pr-elent cafe, no luich billets ucre
sent. The Council met as duaul; and this meeting~ of
C3ouncil happened to be rather more numterous than any
fCormer meeting had been, at leait for fame weeks be~fore.
Of. thirty-three members, which compole this collc~ive
body of Megiffrates and Town-council, only four mem-
bers were ablent; one of whom was confinied to his bed
by indifpolition; and with refpc~t to the other three, wve
have not heard that any one~of them ventured to sav, a.;
aIn excule for his.ablnce, that, it wals occasioned. by his
having heard the above-mentioned report. But what is
rnoff remarkable in this cafe, is, That the perfojns who hav·e
been mos1 induff~rious in publithing this report, w'ere inr
fa~t a~tually prelent in the Council. When all thele cir-
cumlan~ces are attended to, he muff be credulous indeed,
who can perfunde himself that there was any premedita-
ted design artfully to pr-event the Iiitendaince of a single
member; especially when it is further considered, tha~t e-

v·ery

very arltifice of this k~ind seems to have been altogether tirf
necessary. It is eviden~t there was no want of numbers.
Whelither there was any Rich se~cret manoeuvre in this as-
fair, as has been sally reported, or whether many or few
were in that feucet, this is a certain fa&t, that of twe~nty-
nine mem~bers then present, tw?·nty-three voted,,Prelent

Mr Dyfl/c;five voted againf1 it; and one was non

ji7Zuet .

Another obje~ion to th~e condiuai of the Magiffrates

and Council, on which a1 great deal of firels is laid, is
founde~d on the resolution of the Council r750, which
theyl marintain was a solemn afl, prohibiting: the Itaing any
ftcp towards fettling~ a Mcinifter, till a motion on that head
fbould be three weeks on record

It might perhaps be a fufficient answer to this objec-

tion, That thec resolution of Couincil has no reference to
any other method of iettling: Miniffers, but that which
was cliablithed by the ag-reement in the year 17 20, and
was in dfe at the time it was made ; and therefore, h~ad
this aat of fedia unt, or reorlution of Council, the force
of a flamtue-law, it could not be pled against a prefenta-
tion, which was neither in the view of the framers of that
resolution, nor is comprehended in the words of it.

But further, if it thl~nl be found on enquiry, that this

resolution itlelf was pr~opbled and made in one hour,with-
out any previous deliberation; that so little regard was
paid to it, that, on the ve~ry next vacancy, the Council of
the r 5th f uly, without any previous mnotion on that sub-
jeEt, resolved to call the Miniffers together on the Friday
following, that they might have notice to assemble their
lrepe~tive ifefions, to make out leets or lifts for iupplying
that vacancy, which was done, and the Reverend Dr Kary
ele~ted on the 30th of that mnonth; that some of thei
framers of the resolution,. and particularly Baillie Stuart,
who takes a great deal of the merit of it to himrelf, was
prelent in Council when the fLeps were takten relative to the
ele£1lon of Dr Kay; and there is no~ ev~idence, at leaf} upoli
record, of his having then proteltedt against fach hally pro-

ceed-

(9)

'cedings*: if it thall be found in after ele~tions, thougR
teference has sometimes been had to this aRt of feder~unt,
yet that it was never pon~tually oblerve~d; and that it has
often been totally disregarded, particularly in the ]lat e-
Seation of a Miniffer to this city, when the sirs1 motion
on that fubjeat bears date the ty th fune 17 61, all the
preliminary fleps arei afterward taken, and the Reverend
Dr Hynldman2 ele~ted on the ·25th of thet fame month;
it will be evident, that this famous resolution was calcula-
ted mer~ely to se-rve a particular purpole:; that is was soon
thought to be inconvenient and ablurd; and that the
framers of it themselves, though they did not formally re-
fcind it, as effeatually abolished it, by immediate dilure·.

The invalidity of this obje~tion will further appear, if

it be considered, that no Council can either tic up them-
fielves, or their luccefl~lrs in office, so as to hinder or pr-e-
vent their free exercise: of all the r~ights and privilegecs
inherent in them as adminiflrato-rs. The absurdity~ of
flippofmng the contrar-y appears on consider-ing the nature
of those rights, which eloiple or expire at a certamn term,
aind cannot be recovered again by those who are original-
ly vefited with them. Refo'utions of court, a~ts of f~ede-
iunt, or by-laws, may regulate the form of procedure 4
but they cannot refrrain or bar a Community from the
exercile of their legal and essential rights; and all faclx
nats and resolutions are ip/o far ·o aull and void.

B~ut there is little occasion to reason on this point, since

the Lords of SefiTon have decided in a similar cafe, viz.

* 'Tis true, that in~ one of those daily lucubrations of

ailurmny and romance, that are handed about in the firects

force it. This happened on the I sth of furl) r 7 .2 U nfbr-
Funately, the other memiber~s-tl en .prel~ent cannot, ,at this di·
stance of time, recolledt any thing about: thle matter.

that of the arlminifrlrato-rs of Herist's h~oipital; thei~r
Lolrdtlhip· having rectuled a bill of fu~lpenfion, in which a
mmoullty comlp!lained~ to the-m, That the major~ity of the
achlniniffrators had rfciniled an aA or resolution, by
wlhich petitions for feu-r~ights were to ly one month on
the table before the~y were committed, and aniother month
after the comminittee made their report. T'his is a cafe 10
dirdi'ly in point, thatr the bare menition of it is fufficicen
to e~xpole the~ abLurityit of' thec objeftion : nay, the court
of sci~on have even gone further than this , for, in the
cafe aIbove nona~rtecd. in which the MLagiffrates and Coun-
cil hadf limnitedi thcir own powers in thlre choice of` Mini-

andl all the alls app~·lrovmg! of the JAmel, andl declarTEd them
to be voidl and null from the begiinnlgr, and in all time
coming7u. Another ob~jeEion to the manner of granting the pre-
(entation, is, Tha1,t the Loi d Prlovoff, without any warrant
fr-om the Coulncil, h~ad taken upon him to tranfmnit the pre-
fantration to Mr- Dryflir, for his acceptance; and that, in
order to jullify this 11cp, there rans after~wards added to
the minute: of the day, without authority, an appointment
of Council to that purpcoles

T`he fa~t really flandis thus: That the above-mentioned

appomntme~nt was not taken down in writing in the rcroll-
book; on the ift D~ecembe·r, but wias added the evening fol-
10wying inl the Council-chamber by Mr It~tilliarmfon, who had
afTted as cleik, on his having the omission pointed out to
him by a deputy-clerk, and his recollefting that foch ap-
-pointment -had- atually been made.

Thlis is the fa~t, about wvhich the warmth of men erx-

gage~d in party has excited them to make so much noide,
andi to b~rand the Lord P'rovell and Mr W~tilliamfon with the
crimne of fabricating a minute. It is pollible they have
galined one end by it, which is, to milead those who are
to >carelefs to, Txamine at all inito circumf~ances of this
hind, or too zealously of a Oide to examine them with

can~oor-,

( II )

aandour, into the belief that thec whole afftjri has been car .
riedi with falle nduc dilinglenucous arts. I-ru a momecnt's re-
fleaionn muff~ convince ev·ery reafonallble manl, that artifice

that Mr Dr-y/dale will b~e M~inifiesc of` Eid,~;hir:ay. As he
is a man of fufficient al~ilki\s, anl oF unL~~excpti onr,. il e
good1 chara~ter, it mig~ht be( iniferrctd, thatr th~e frenthlmenc
whlo have taken so mnuchi painis o (Id unrr e the mini~s (,f the
inh~abitants, are neither a~ting the palrt of goodl citi7.n.1s
nor goo~d men, since their vio~lent opposition cani frcve: no
puripole but to alienate the hearts of the people from hiis
mnimitry, by conneating him, in their idlens, with a~ mea-
fare th~at robs themn of` their liberty both~ as citizens and
Chrifiains. But it is improper to make to harth a conclu-
sion, till we have examined the cale a little farther, and
cons~idered the reasons that may have indtuced thie Council
to pr-clent, and the motives that may have influenced th~e
genitlemen who oppole.

The first reason that of~fers, why the Town-council have

prelentedl upon this occallon, if alny renfon needi be affigln-
ed~ for the exercile of a rig:ht inherent in them, is, That
they mig~ht not lole that right by prefecription. F'or since
it is argueld againf1 them, That as byV invanriabi cuc//oi,l

Edinlburg~h, above forty ycars ago, the mnethod of fettlinlg
h~irks has~ breen by the Counlcil andl Genernl·J o nz s in a co!/e~c-
tive~ bo~y ; therefore the Council have no power· to plreent:
and since the decree: of the court of itllion in the year 17 39
is called in queflion, as a decree givenl in ab/enlce, or void
anld nurrl 2n it/Ecy, becau/e the Courncl have never face rnade
7!/e of their pre~tended right; it seems to have been high
time for the Community to do what was incombent on
them to sa~ve their right, if they have any, by a speedy
exercile of it. But though this reason is good againfl the
gentlemen who oppole, yet it wvas not probably in the view
of the Tlown-council w~hen they, pr-esented: they had other,
reasons, it would seem, for wirthdrawing their wonted in-
diulgence from the G~eneral-fii~ons, and exercising their
rig:ht upon this occallon.

It may b~e proper, however, before we explain there.

r-eaions, to obser~ve, that althiough prelentations were in-
var-iably in use in this City, during what are called the
purl-/ttimcs of Prefy~teryry orJIe the Revabirtion ; yret, for
a good many years after the refforation of thiat right in the
roth of queen A·7/nn, the people ds Scotland in general
h;ad a grecat aversion to them·n ; wh·ich was long preserved
by· the ecclefinfl~cal courts; wvho received them with reluc-
tanice, and took a great deal of pains to defeat th~em as
often as possible. In that per-iod too, it deserves tobe no-
ticed, that the moss confideralble inhiabitants of Edlinbrgirh,.
mecn both of wildom and of property, and sometimes the
fivesi ior judges themselves,, composed the General-feffions
of Edinbu2rlgh: it was not therefore to be wondered at, that
thec TIown-council fell in with the prejudices of the times,
and adimitted the Miniffers and Elders to an equal vote
with th~emselves in the ele~rion of' Miniffers. And for a
considerable space of time they had no caule to repent of
their· indn~ligence; for it met w~ith a proper return. The
p' odent Mliniffers and Elders of those days had relpe~t to
the inclination of the undoubted patrons: if right was
not rigidly exercise~d on the one hand, neither were in,

trjgues

( r·3 )

-tr-igues and cabanls entered into on the other. kn process
of time, however, encr-oachments wcere made that tended
to provoke the Comm~unity; in 10 much that they thought
themlfel·ess bound to ra;ise the process of redutlion and de-
clarator in the year r7 39, which has been mentIoned al-
ready. Satisfied with ascertaining their right, andi pro-
bably believing that the Mlinifkrs and Elders would treat
them with greater regard for the future, they continued
to proceed in elei-tions according to the former plan. But
It would have beecn happy for the Town, and for the slate
of reliigion, if they hiad imitated the· example of their pre-
decccllor~s who lived a centur-y before·, anid who thought
themse-lves bound in duty to exercise a righit with whiich
they were vefredl.----A great change had now been madle
in the opinioins of the pe~ople: their div·ine right to chufe
.their- own pallo;·s was generally given up, in the fedre inl
which they undefltood it; anld the laws by w~hich they
heid! e~very thing~ that was valuable, were thoughjt wo~thly
of the power of reLgulating the for~ms b~y wrhich Miniffer-s
of the ef~ablihedl chur~ch were to be lettled. TIhe law of
patrron3ge had beecn explaineld and enforlced: th~e church-
,courts had for fame tim~e invariab~ly fuipported it by their
deciious; andc when caifes happened wh:ere popular dc-!c
tionis took place, they occarioned so much cabal and ini-
trigue, foch difienflon and animosity, belides many Aib-
-ordinatec vices, that it nio longer remained doubtful with
mecn of fedle anld re~fkft~ion, whether or- not the abolition
~of the patronage-law was a defirecable ob~jct.

T'he M~ag~ltiltrats and Town-council of Ed'inbw~-g~h, in

[pite of the chanlge we have mnentioned, have had frequent
provocations fr-om the G~leneal-kf~ijons finrce the year I 7 39-
An alte~ration of manners had introduced many persons of`
onferior rank inito the leffions, who becing more liable to
the influence of ambitious and dfi~gningf men, often enter-
ed into combinations to th~wart the inclinations of a great
Inaijority of the 'Community, in whom the paitronage was
trefkd: for, by a Hrange error· in prudecnce, the mor·e the

mnin~s

trdnds of men were recconciled to pr-esentations, the mor'E
viole~ntly did they set themfrelves in opposition to the un-
doubltedi atr-ons. Several recetnt inflances had occurred,
wh)en fach combinations had been formed to prevent the
ekP~.on of fomer of the abkf1t and worthiefl~ Miniffers of
the City; by the method of eleftion, it wias ver~y pra~ti-
cable to exclude the gentleman who was moil acceptable

Sto a conjuna~ body of electors, from the poilibility of be-

jng cholen: for the fill, leets or lifts of candidates, are
kdo and c:by eth par~ticular fefffians, in which the order of
·Deacon~rs. who are o~f equalnumber with the Elders, have
.a vorice, though they are not admnitedd with the conjundt
btody~ of elc~tors; an originat error, which renders the
whiole plan absurd and ridi~culous: and in faRt, s~uch an
tal';ion was very lately attempted, in the cafe of the
Re~verend Mr Dick;, againfl whom a device was fallen up-
ca;, to engage the De-acons of particular Sellions to exclude
himn from all1 their leatS: andl the point was carried so far,
t atr it wa~s with the uttmoll diffilty a sing~le Selflion could
Al: imman to put: that gen~tlemanu on the leet, and that only
by a1 caffinig voie. So danglcrous was rj~e power with which
mec n liatble to th~e .bar:loft a!rtifice. and ca~pable of the moAt
groulndkc( precjuidices, were·· in~trafte~d by the plan of t·ele~ion.

Th~le cafe w~as much the famne on the ele~ion of Dr Ro-

fhirtion and Mir Lundie, who, though they ha1d the great
major~ity of .the Town-counrcil on therir sidle, were choien
.chil by a velry Cnll mai;jorlity of votes.

TZhe M~agil·1rates andi Towin-counci) having fach glarin~g

·inflances be~forle th-eir· eye·s of unreaso~nable comnbinations
among the Elder-s and Dcacons, could not help oblerving
the late operatio~nJJ with the utmost concern. No sooner
wa;!s there a vaca3ncy by the death of the Reverend Dr
.1ryvcindenar than the persons who seem to have thought It
part of their dutcy to appokt every candidate wvho was a-
'jrceab~le to a majorityv of the- Towo-council, ser all their
en:gines at woi k to fruthat~e th~e inclinations of the Corrimu-
Trity; andc on thiis occa~ion their I~ands wereC firengthened

by

;by an unexpected body of auxiliaries from a certain r-eve-
nue-office~, who had no fort of rigiht to inlter~fere, but who
rared neithler zeal nor timt- to provide the City with a Mli-
auffer agreeable~ to themfcelves.

It was no wonder- that the 19Ligiffrates and Town-coun-

cil were jealous of their own rights upon this occention, and
resolved to give check to luch ilrregular and difielpdhol~i
cabals. As thety considered a proper choice of mninlbu ;s
as a matte~r of the utmoff importance to the City, was it
not their duty to take that choice out of' the hands of. mnrn
on all occallons undilcerning, and prepoffeffetd in the pre-
sent cafe, who had f~rquently thewn their inclination to
exclude the maf1 learned, able, and truly pious mindktrs
from the City. and to dle their own judgment in thle exer--
cile of their undoubted right, as they\ wourld~ be..,T. anfwr b
~for the inf-luence the Mliniffers they had elefied w~ouldi have
on the religion and morals of the people ?

Bunt besides the experience th'ey had, that a league a-

mong the Deacons had well nigh defeated as worthy a
choice as they could possibly make; and the appreheation~
of feeing themse~lves robb ed of their righ~t, by the inltr-iqutes
and folicitations of a set· of men to whole department thle
i~elefon of Muinillers wats altogether foreign; therle was
another reason, which, in the opinion of all g~oo men,
ought to have weighed much with the M'agiffrlates anld
Council; and that was, thie perniiious efR £ts which the
eldhion of Miniffers in the usual form has. of late had onl
the morals of the inhalbitants. Though the bottom was~
not very latrge nor popular, comprehe~ndingr only the Mnlji-
niffe~rs, Elders, and Deacons; yet the Council might have'
often, w~ith the deepeflt regret, oble~rved wh~at di~fffectionl
to their law~ful govecrnors, and what diffntion among them-
selve~s, the eldtion of M~iniffers had of late occutionedl a-
mong the inhiabitants of the City; not to mentionl more
flnagant vices that prevailrd among some, to the total 0-
verthrow of sobriety of manners and Chlrillian charity
Canl it b~e d-o!bted, then, that it w'as the: duty of the. M;(

gith :ites

(i r6 )

giftrates and Town-council of Edin2burgh/, to put an end
to such disorders, by the exercise of a right with which
th~ey are velled by the law of the land ? By perverflon of
language, libecrty sometimes flands for licentiodrnels, and
indulgence for privilege: and in whant other fed~e can the
citizens be said to be deprived of their liberty, or the El-
ders of their privilege, by the late deed of the Magiffrates
and Council ?the Magiffrates and Town-council, then,
inflead of blame aind reproach, deserve thninks and praise
.for their late Ifpirited aiffrtion of their own rights, andP
their v~igilanit care over the manners of the people. And
however much the judgments of the citizens may be bianffedl
for a while, by the molt unjutlifiible arts that have beett
ufedl to kindle their pafflons, they w~ill soon recover their
wvonted cand~our and solidity: and that venerable person,
who has so, ofte~n, w~ith univerfidi applaule, held th~e filft
place in th~e Community, wil lfind it ranked among the 0-
thier monuments of his punblic spirit, that he rescued thle
siglht of chuf~ing their- own Minificrs fi-om the hands of
~those whio h-ad' aiffamed it without any~j title either in ju-

~lice or- laJ.

Tb c ppofition is for-med out of three different orderst

of me~n, viiz. the minority of the: Towin-council, the Com-

leges of their fellow-c-itizenIs, as sue allprehenid is remanrkabliy
donei in2 this caf. In fuipport of this affection, they make
a diffid~tion between the r~ight of a private patron by in-
heritance, and that of truffees or guardians. But the ar-
gument they have pressed into their service is dirdfly in
point against them: for though a private ge~ntleman may
give away his patronage, or fuffer it to be forciched by
prescription, without being accountable to any one; yet
trfltees or adminiffrators, foch as are the Malgiffr-ates andt
Council of a borough, cannot, with i·fafty, give away the
rights of the borough, or fuffer them to faill to another, by
their negleC1 even of a single vice : for if they Iwear, that
they will maintain and defend all the rights andl privilegres
of that borough, whereof the right of patronage is one,
their averflon to the method of fe~ttling: churches by pre-
fentations muff be firong indeed, before it cin set them
free from the obligation of their oathi. But we are tra-
flees and guardians for the public, fay the gentlemen.
Surely not for the inclinations of the public, much lels for
their prejudices, railed and preserved by a rpirit of fallion.
They are truffees and guardians for the liberties and pri-
leges of the citizens, as defined by law, and exerciled with-
in that legal cofltitution of government which the Je-
gillature of Greant Britainz has eflablithed among them.
WMithout that legal conflitution of government, or form of a
M~agifracy and Town-council, the citizens of Edinbunrgh
have no liberties or privileges differentt from oth·er fubjefts
of Great Britain2. T'he Companies, indeed, or Incorpo-
rations, have the privilege of elefting the memberss of the
Council; but th~ey ought to remember, that the fame Je-
gal confitation that has vefied them with that power, li-
rnited and reflra~ine~d by ceirtin forms, has vefied the right
of prelentation, andl mnlny other rights, in the Magiffrates
and Council, as a colleftive body; and that they can no
mor·e lawfu~lly claim the right of' cla~ing a Mliniffer, than

C the

the Mag~istrates a~nd Council can claim the'right Of chufrag)

Th~e times ar-e happily over, as we obse~rved in another

It has happened burt very seldom, that the people of a pari~h

men have induffrioufly enfilamed them agrainf} him; or·
when some of the clergy in their neighbour-hood have
taught them, both by do~rinle and by condu~t, that obey

to b~e noticed, that the gecntlemnen diiover a very tender

ass Rted by dilcontent with the eliablit~hed Miniffers, and
attendance on fc-parate places of worthip - points that are
properly withini the depar~tment of the clergy, and which,
it is thought, they, can answer for as well as any set of cler-

One of the-proteltlers, at leafs, can hardly plead this argue4
mnen w·ith decency~for- it is noc~t long, th~at th~is abhollrienc
of panionage~s, and this fear of o-ffendi~ing the people, has
.pantlled him - having himlelf figFned a prefectration to Ihe
·pu ilh es` Culrrie, when he was Dea~n of G uild~, in faice
of a more violtnt oppolition thani is at prelecnt in the cafe
.of M'r DryJilale. Wha~t condu~r this g~ntlema~ n has~ hcild
in the cafe of other prderntations in the Gift of the IMa-
.gilhiares and Cou~ncil, we have not hearld: certa~in it ir,
that in the char.a~er of a judg~e inl the judicatu~res of t~e
ch~urch hie has of~ten f~uppor~te! the r~ight of patro~nage,:
thoug~h he dilaivows it wne~n vefiedc in tht· Commni \uii! to
a hiich he be~longs, w~hole rig~hts an J priv~ikge~s, as cfla-
bli-fbetd by law, he is borund to mainttaini.

It is hard to alcr-ibe to mens aftions othe~r motives than

they themselves avow : but when theci. Coldullt is so) \.elY
incod~lle-nt; when they give up the rights of the· Cit!,
and y'et pr-oif o themselves the def endecr s of' the libecrties andl~
.privileges of the citizrrns: when they one da~y fupporlt pr e-
fe~nittions, and concir- in carirying them into, ecu~c~tion,
and the next o~ppole· thiem, andi pleadl against themn, as dec-
trimenutal to religiocn , whenrr they prctendl to hav~e the most
tender rega~rd to the moi als of the inihabitants, and yett
flir them up to dilconte nt w:ith the powe~rs whichl G;OD
hath et over the~m; it woculd be a thtch ofcharity to
believe, that tisch men were~t ai~t!atedc by no other miotives
than zea~l for- religion, regalrd for morials, andl the love of'
the publ!ic.

The secon~d orderT of grnltlmen wh~o oppole·, nre the

Incorporations. It is furprifingl, that so many! inteiiligent
ptrfo~ns, for loch at le~ast many of them are·, seem not to
have adverted to a plainu and obvious trutih, viz.Thti
opposing the right of the Town-council, and in fulpport-

is as; grea~t a f>1lccifin in politics as ever wras : for it notually

tin equal vote with the Council, who are thleir reprefen-
tatives, and whomn they hanve the power of changing every
year-. When they allow fifty-torDons vocclus \.IC in
formingn thle orig~inal lilts, who, as we have seen, may, put
a negatcive on any Miniff-er; when they allow fifty-four
E~tde:·s and fifteen Miniffers to eqlual votes with the M/agi-
Thatles and Council, who are only thirty-three in the elec-
tion; they no less than twice, in the choice of ev~ery Mli-
nifer, give away the"ir own r-ight and powers into thie
hrandrs of ccclefnltical perrl ns, who, as fac-h, are no part
of the political body. How w'ouldl the eleRor-s of (;reatn
BritanN~ he alarmed, if the Honfe of Commons, their re-
repicrefemative bodyr, (hlould assume a thoda~nd men firom
am;ong the trading companie~s of Londoln, for inflance,
to deliberalte and vote wvith~ them on the great afthlirs of
the nation ? The Corporations have a similar caule of :i-
larm,. tholugh it has hitherto efcacped themn, when the plan
of the yeair r7 20 is put into execution. Andl if it be
fulrther considered, that the ecclefialltical persons who are
~ther-eby admitted to thnlre the rights of the ToTwn-coiincil,
hold their of`FICes for life, or· during: their own good plean-
for-e, it will be found, that no rcheme of government ini
thiis kinrgdom hids io fair for a hierilrchy, as that of which
the cgentl~meln of' the Corporations seem to' be so fond.
Ar-nd from thiis quarter alone, and not from the thirty-
thiree~ members of the Town council, who are liable to be
chalnged every year, and are the ele~ted reprelentatives cif
the great political body, is there any danger of arbitrar'y
powetr, or ryralnnical government, which has been 10 loud-
ly complained of. It is really furp·i~ng, that, at the
ver·1y time wrhen they ar~e pleading high for the diffuflion of
powe r into a greater number of' h-ands, they (hould seem so
fond of settingS up a cruel ar-ilocracy over themselves, in
every thing r-elating to the ele~tion ofr~iniffers. 10 (hiort,
the prelent opposition by the Incorporations to the M~agl-
£}rates and Tow\rn-council's` exercising the legral right of
patronage, is altogeth~er- absu~rd. It is acrin~t dirdtly con-
trar y to the~ir owln interel1. andl a betrayilig of one of the
roof essential privilege-s that as Inlcorporations' they ar~e in-

vcfled

( 2t

velked wcithi. It is mos1 evident, that whatever other
bodfies or societies of men in the City may lose by the ex-
cicife of this righlt, they are great gaiiners by it : for of
thir-ty-three members that form that colle~tive body in
which the law has invefied the right of patronage, the
Corporations, by the~ir reprel~entatives, the Deacons,
make fourteen; whereas oni the other plan, for w~hich
s~ome of them are co~ntending with so, much ieeming zeal,
their pr-oportion in th~e conjuncit body~ of Magiffrates,
Miniffers, and EIlde~rs, is only as fourteen to ninety·-fix or a
hundred.

Iris unnecefl~7ry to mention another body of opp~onents

in the City, vniz. the Me~rchant-com pany, who ha~ve no in-
ter-eit in this queio~n at all; and therefo(re cain only· be con-
fidered as voluinteers in a~ cadle with w~hich they, as a~n in-
corporattedl fciety of Ihopkeepe-rs to kicl all fo~rts of' cloath;s
and fluf~fs for weal~rin appalrel, cannot so much as pretend
even a remiote conne~tion. Th7e difltin~tion betwixt thulp-
keepers and merchants, in every mnercantile: city, is aI di
known. A mer-chant of E~diniburg~h and a thoupkceeper are
two very diffe~rent profe~l~ions, and of very difftrent
chara~lers both inl refpe~t of` wealth and reputation.

And this leads us to the consideration of the thir-d order

of men, who oppole the I'agiff-rates and Council, viz. the
General femions. Their interefft in the matter is evident;
andi we need not look far for the motives of their- condu~-t.
'The agreiement in the y~ear If 20, makeis them in effeit
patr~ons of all the churches in the City ; andl if they thinlk
·thiat poffe~on gives them 'right, they cannot be blamed
for defending that right by every regular and legitimaite
method in their power. But, on the other hand, they
·cannot juffly accule the Miagiffr-ates and T'own-council
'of arbitrary meafores, for recalling~ the indulgence they
']ave given them 10 longr, and which is now caimedd as a
privilege, in manifell violation, as they apprehend, of
·the rights of the City, which they are bouind by a foleman
oath to defend. And it muff here be oblerved, in firrther
jnfification of their con:;u~t, that if' they are not the
patr-ons of churc~hes in Ed~inburrgh, the· City, cr- great pQ-

litical

( 20

an equal vote with th~e Coiuncil, who are theicr reprefen-
tranves, and whomn they hanve the power of changiing ev~ery
year.` W~hen they allow fifty-tour Deaconls .votes nm
formning thle oiirignal iitsi, who1, as w~e have~ seen, may put
a ne::ative on any Miniffer; when th~ey allowv ffty-four
Eide: s and fifteen M~inliffers to equal votes with7 the Magi-
Jha~tesand Council, wYho are only thlirty-three in the elec-
tion; they no less than twice, in the choice of every M5i-
Iilte~r, g~ive away their owrn riighr aind power-s inito thie
handr s oi cclefloffical !perF·,ns, who, as fucih, are no part
of the political b~ody. H~ow would the eclors of r;rcat
Brritain2 he alalrmed, if the Honfe of Commnons, their re-
Irepl-~refemtive body, th~ould assume a rhooin~r d men fr.omT
am~ong the tradijng companie~s of Lolndon, for inflance,
to deliberaite and vote wvith them on the· great affhlirs of
the nation ? The Corporations have a £1milar caule of a-
larm, tholighi it has hitherto efcaoned them, when the plan
of the yecar 17 20 is put into exe~cution. And if it be
fur~ther considered, that the ecclefalical persons who are
thlereby admitted to thare the r-ights of the Town-coirncil,
h(,lld their otfices for- life, or· durinrr their own good ple~a-
lure, it will be found, that no Tch~eme of g-overnment in
thiis king~dom lbids 10 fair for a hieritrchy, as that of which
the grentle~m:n of thie Corporations seem to be so fond.
Aind from thiis quarter alone, and not from the thirty-
thiree members of the' Town council, who are liable to be
changled every year, and are the ele~ted representative~s cif
the great political body, is thcere any danger of arbitraryr
power'T, or lyrlnnlical gove~rnme~n t , which has been io loud-
ly complaine~d of. It is really surprising, that, at thle
very time w~hen they are pleading high for the ditfiblioni of
powetr mnro a greater number of hands, they (hould seem 10
tfond of lettilng up a cruel arillocracy over themselves, in
every thing relating to the ele~tion ofR/iniffers. 10 (hort,
the present opporition by the Incorporations to the M~agl-
fIratcs andl T4owrn-council's e. ·ercifing the legral right of
patronage, is altogether- abfuird. It is a~tingl dire~tll con-
trar v to, the~ir owtn inereell, and a be-tray-irig of one of the
moll essential pr ivilegs" that as Inlcorpora3tions · they alre in-

aftecd

( 2 );

vpelled with. It is mos) evident, that whatever other
bodlies or societies of men in the City may lole by the ex-
cr~cife· of` this right, they ar-e great g~ainers by it : for of
thirty-three members that form that colle~tive body in
which the law has invefied the right of patronage, the
Corporations, by the~ir reprdelntatives, the Deacons,
makie fourteen ; whereas onl the other plan, for which
ifome of' them ar-e co~ntending~ with 10, much seeming zeal,
their pr-oportion in th~e conjuinR bodyv of Magiffrates,
Miniffers, and Elders, is only as fourteen to ninety·-fix or a
hundtred.

Iris unnecefn~ry to mention another body of opponents

in the City, viz. the Me·rchant-company\, who hav~e no in-
terest in this que~tion at all; andt therefnr-e cain only· be con-
lidered as volulntceers ini a caule with w~hichi they., as an in-
corporatedc faciety of !hcpkeepe-rs to fe~ll all forts of cloaths
and fluffs for weril~ng apparel], cnanot so muoch as pretend
eveni a remote conneailon. The difin~cion betwixt th~up-
keepers and mer-chants, in everry mer~cantitil city, is we~ll
k~nown. A merchant of Edlinbulrg~h andc a thopkeeper aree
two very different profe~llions, and of very diftHrent
char~a~ers both in1 refpea of wealth~ and reputation.

And this leads us to the consideration of the thirdn order

of men, who oppole the MaIgiftrates and Council, viz~. the
General letions. Their interest h the matter is evident;
andi we need not look far for the motives of their- condua.t
'The agreement in the year ly 20, makes them: in effe&t
patr`ons of all the churches inl the City ; andl if they thinlk
trhat poffed~ion gives them right, they cannot be blami-ed
for defending that rigfht by every regular and legitimaite
method in their power. But, on the other hand, they
cannot juffly accofe the MLagiffratits and T'own-council
'of ar~bitrary meafoures, for recallinlg the indulgenlce they
h!ave given them so loner, and which is now claimned as a
privilege, inl manifelt violation, as they apprehend, of
-the rights of the Ci Ly, which they are bound by a folema
oath to defend. And it mull here be obleeved,~ in further-
jnflification of their con·.;uR, that if' they are not the
PatrOns of chlurches in Edinbturgh, the· C~ity, cr· grear pcl-

litical

( 22 )

fiiicall body, halve Il0 mannner of claim; for in that· cafe
th~e u~pht falls to the crowvn, The confe is no~w, forr the
Secor~d time, b-rought bt-fore the Court of Session ; ald if
they (houltl confirm th~eir form~er decree, it is to be houped
·thzt the· General-fe[[iions \ ill fabmnit. If they do not,
.had tempr" wiii be alledged, as the: sole cause: of their

.mcirl Aiiembly, abofe rulee of juc'gment cannot be- the
sriprice of a little angry f~ioin, ba t the law~s of the land
whiich they neither can nor will tranfprtlefs.

The Rtverend' Miniffer-s of the C'ity are the natural

-leaderls of' the General-fTiilios; an~d as they are a very
refpc table bhodydo men, well dese~rving of the love and
dicecm of -tneir peCople, it is w~ith sIncere regr-et, that we
perceive any thIng exceptionable or extraordinary inl their
'condufE. Hlad the law of the land velled them with the
right of patr-onag~e, thie citizens of Edlinburghn would have
be~en happy mn the prudent choice of felIlow-lalbourers
·they wvould alwayslhave made.. But as it has not, it seems
;Fra~nge, that men of ~their juffice and moder~ation, and
who underifand fu~ perfea~ly the for-ce of law~s, in this land of.
3liberry andi laws, .(bould contend so earnfltly for a pow~er
wvhich the law has veiled in aniother body, and which these~
is no chanceof their ever obtaining, but according: to th-e pro-
,viiajn of law, that is, tnpanguamjuredev'o/utot. To themn, hown-
-eve~r, it is bhelived, is chiefly owing the prdenet heats and
dlifkntions in the City; w~ilhout them, ·it is supposed, thle
Eldus and Deacon~s w~ould have parted w~ith fuibmiffion
thocugh, no doubrt, w~ith rregre, w-ith wh~at they have er-

Th<]: Rvrlelnd Clergy, it w\ill be allowed, aIppear with

their several churches before th~ey wer-e cal~zle to Edht-~
buirgh : and have, besides, in thet course· of' their duty as·
judlges in -the ~cclefaiafical courts, supported th~e law of.
patronage by their voices, in the decisions that have b~eca·
given. With as little decency can they plead the danera
of` court-influence, in cafe the right of patronage (houlid
be found to be in the M~agifrfrates and Council, lInce~ ve~ry
few of themn have not fonnerly availed themselves or the
recolmmendations of great men, to bring their mer~it whifl-
in the viewr of the conjuna~ body of elec'ors. The cl-r-
gy are men of- like weakne~sss and patlions with others,
andi fometimnes imag6ine they are defefnding the rigihts andt
libertie~s of the public, wheni they are only lapporting thcir-
ownl interest anld auth~ority. B~ut inconfllencies )1n the
coundaG of particular men, ar-e not arguments agnainlt the
fidce they elpoule. The-y mnay, indeedt, open th~e eyes of
thole whlo imnplicitely follow, anld lessen the influence of
popular demnagogues; but the cause· irelf is the CEune,
whether their decfence of it arise froum pati~on, or the love
of truthr; and therefore we (hcall not at prl-eCnt examinze
into the private or ped~onal motives of their conduat.

One prelent purpole of thebrs, however, mull not escape

our observation; that was, to e~nflame the minds of the
peo~ple ; for with that exprels desig~n were the remnonfirances
-of the General-feflions made public, andi the other d~eclara-
tions of thle Mecrchant-company and sev\eral Corpora~rions,
wvhich have filled the news-papers for lame time pas1;
not to mention the defixmatory pamphlets and hand-il
that are the produiic of folly and virulence, with whlich
nenther theC clergy, nor any other part of the oppolitiont
·can be chatrged julfly, farther than as they are: codeci
qluences of tha t fatious and licentlous spirit they have
raile~d. We (halli not enter into the contr overly, WYhether
or not it is eve~r reasonable, proper, or necefrry, to enflame
the mninds of the people ? It muf1 be allowed~ to be a dan-
gerous engine, which~ the boldest political cabuills do no0t
perm~it to be used with extreme necenlty. And whien the
Miniffers of the gospel of peace are to work the engine~
the obje6t had surely need to be great, the necelity precf.

dg;ifig.act thanE convi~tion that it is so~, yety c'lear, befoire
the-y begin. Whether or not this is the cafe ,at prdelpt,
the imnpartial reader is left to judgec for ltiple~~lf.:

We have now represented: the groundsplsf he right of

patronage, and examined the formality of' the pt~qlent deed
of presentation. We have endeavoured to trace the rea-
fobns that may have infinlenced the condit~ of the MagI-
firates and Council in the prelent cafe, and to dilcovelr
the motives that may have operated on the gentlemen of the
~oppolition. Our view of the cafe, upon the whole, is
br~iefly this, That it is a dilpute between the Magiflrate~s
and Town-council, and in them the City or great politi-
cal body, on the one fide, and the Minifiers, Deacons, and
Elders, on the other, for the power of nominating or chu-
sing the Miniffers of Edinburgh ; that is, between all the
cmrzens on one fide, and 123 ecclefiatical persons on the
other.

IE. the Magistrates and Towo-council are on the fide of

legal r~ight, and conflitutional liberty, let them be-fupport-
;ed with vigor; if they are not,, let them be pppoled Iwith~
decency. If any citizen, upon mature deliberation,- is,osf
opmsion, that the preleuntaion to Mr D~ryfdle ~robs him of
:his liberties and privileges, let him heartily join the op'po-
flition : but if he think, that the pre·Cent diffenrlon is the
.work of a par~ty firoggling for power, let him support
..the lawful governors of the City with courage and zeal,;
certain that his legal pr~ivleges are bell secured to h~im una-
.der a legal administration. Heats and animnofties may
lprevail for some time : the paikions of' men may blow tile
flame, and it may spread flill wider. Such artificial fires
.have been kindled before : they have r~aged for a while,
but at last have died, or been extingauithed. Such, we
snmay certainly foretell, will be the fate of the prelent com-
,bullion, which has been solely occalloned~ by the rele~nt-
. ment of dilappointed ambitioni.

Ilinc illar lachrymae.
