S I R,

sincerely believe, that whoever has advised
our Miniffers to this unreasonable Demand,
has been no personal Friend to them nor

their Cause either in Church~ or Sta~te.

It is a common Noation, that the M~iniffers of

the Church of Scotland have very fmnall Revenues,
and are ill foupported. This appears true to such
as are dazzled with the Splendor of the dignified:
Clergy of fomneCountries : But, on Inquiry, it will
be found, that thle Incomes of our Miniffers 'are
not only f~ufficient, but that they possess a greater
Proportion of the R8evenues of their Country than1
anly other Protestant Clergy whatever.

It can easily be made appear, that the whole A6-

mount of the Land and Hodies of Scotland poffref-
fed by the Laity, does not exceed L. 820,000 per
annum. Ouar Land-tax, at two MVonths Ces~s, a-
mounts to L. I2,000: And it is universally
known, and: I behieve wdll not be contradifted,
that, take the Kingdom throughout, two Months
@Ces amounts to above 34 d. in the Pound of the
rreal R~ent: And it: will be difficult: to find any
County in Scotl~and, which, at eight Months Cef4;
that is, four Shillings in the Pound Land-tax, does
not really pay one Shilling and two Pence. Ald-
mitting this, it follows, that as 14 d. is to 249 d.
i. e. one Pound Sterlinzg; I is L. 48,900, our
Land-tax, to Lb. 822,858, the Rent of the whole
Land and Houses of Scotland poffeffed by the Lai-
ty. One sixth, or L. 8000, of this, is to be paid
by the Boroughs, and is to be considered as a Tax
on Houles or Trade, rather than on Land 3 which

As bein~g

[4}

being dedu~t~ed, as it ought, reduces the real ~Rerpt
of a.11 the L~and in Scotland to L. 685= 7 4-

' h is difagrecable to find one's self obliged to

publish this to the W7orld, when Money is at least
as much refpe~ted as it ever was in former timres s
and is become the Stindard for ascertaining the-
Value, not only of individual Mien and Things,
but of Nations too. However, as I am perfuanded
it is from not having considered the State and Po-
verty of this Country, that so pious and disinter-
efted a Set of 1Ven, as the Synbd of Glasgow and
Air, have been milled, and the fame Error might
rniflead others; I hope I shall be tbrgiven for en-
deavouring to reconcile those Gentlemen to their
Oricumffances, by making them sensible, that it
is only owing to the Poverty of our Country, if
thiey are not the richest Protestant Clergy in Eu-
yope a for, on Inquiry, it will appear that they
really posses~s above one tenth of the Revenue of
the Kingdom, take i't in what Shape one will.

I am afr~ure'd, there are above a thousand efta-

blifhed Clergynien in ~Scotland,: including Second
ZMiniffers, Profeffors of Divinity, King's Cha-
plains, ffc. s and $ believe it will not be disowned,
that the Stipends of these amounts to at least L. 65
per annum, one with another : It will liktewife be
gllowed, that the G~lebje, which must be four Acres
a~t least, and generally consists of the best Land ina
the P~arish, is'worth 20s. per Acre : T9he eCow and
Horse Graiil, and Church-yard, one carl hardly
value at less than 40 s. : The Exemption from
JLand-tax, Rogue-money, Highways, Edc. can-
not be computed at les~s than L. 5 per annu2zm: And,
lastly, the Mans~e or House Rent, in which thC
Mjinier will hardly drive a Nail, and where all

-,-- Reparacions

E s 1

Reparations muff be done by the Heritors, is
certainly worth L. 7, so s. per alnnumn, especially
as there is generally a Garden to it s and I imna-
gine it cannot be proved, that any Manse has
of late been built for les~s than L. I00 s and it is
but moderate to allow 7a per cenzt. for Money laid
out on Houi-es, where one is bound to uphold.--
TIhus the thoufagnd M~inisters in Scotl~and a~tually
poffefs' and enjoy above L. 80,000 per annumn out
of about L. 700,000, the Rent of the Land, or of
L1. 822,857, the total Amount of Land and Bo-
rougzhs in Scotland. And as the Number of Peo-
yIle in Scotlanzd is thought to exceed L. I,000,000,
it appears that 1000 Clergymien possess above a
tenth of the I~ncome o~f that I,ooozooo, i. e. ~oo
Shares each, and yet are not contented.

The great Neifie one is used to hear about the

overgrown Revenues of the Church in Enzgland',
has probably produced the Propos~al in question (
and yet I can affIure the Reverend Gentlemen,
that, on Inquiry, they will find thems~elves infi-
nitely better` off than the En7ghf~ Clerg;y, notwidx.g
flanding all that is said of their huge Livings.

There are x 1,000 Parishes in England: The

Amount of thes~e Livings taken together, does not:
come to L. r20, one with another , andi taken
se~parately, there are not 500 orut of the whole that
exceed L~. 200 or 250 a-piece.

It will not be amiss- to compare the Income of

ain Englih Clergyman of L. I20 a-year, with t~hat
of a Scots Mdiniffer of L. 70.

Tj~he Clergy in Hollanzd, ~except at Amf~erdam,

Roterdamnn, the Hague, and two or three other
great Towns, have none of them lo000 Guilders
per annum, which, with the Taxes they pay, does
nojt make L. 70: And there is no Protestant
Clountry in Eu~rope, where the Income of the
Clergy amounts to one twentieth of the Rent of
the Lands, except in Great Britaina. And in
England the RIevenue of all the Clergy, Cathe-
drals included, and even the Revenue set apart
for keeping up thes~e su~mptuous Edifices, does
not exceed L. I,600,000i. Tho' the Land of E~ng-
larid is confeffed to amount to L. 20,000,ooo per
annum; which is but two twenty fifths of the
whole: Whereas our Clergy cost us one tenth.

Harrington proposes an A~grar~ian Law, by which

in Enzgland he would ref frain the Poi~ffeon of one
MaTn to L~. 2000 per annum in Land a and thinks,
that in Scotland no one Man ought to possess more
than· 500 a-year. Our Countryman, FletchSer of Sal-
ton, thought no Man in Scotland ought to have above
L. 200 a-year. Surely, in a Country where these
Patriots thought it of dangerous Consequence,
that: any Man thould have more than L. 5 or- 200
a-year, they would never have recommended a
Man as an Obj~eft of Charity who enjoyed L. 70.

Suppose a C~ountry Gentleman to succeed to

L. 200 a-year in the common W~ay in Scotlzand,
after having bu~ried Father and Mother, and leaf
us sl~ate the Cafe betwceen him and a M~iniffer.

Suppose him to owe for burying his Pa-

rents, entering HZeir, Infeftment, and
some old Accompts, -· I god0

But Al~ppoling this fame Laird to· be left

20,000 Merkis of D3ebt, or a Jointure, and let:
one only imagine how the Clomparifon will Rtand.

On thle whole, I sincerely with the R~ent· of%

Scotl~and amounted to more, and. could afford
more. In that Cafe the M~inisters might hope to
be iftened to s but, as M~atters Rtand, they have
an ample Share of the Property of their Country.

Scotland is really poor : And one would expeft

from the Christian Clergy,. thiey ·would show us
an Example of Moderation, to reconcile us to
the Inc~onveniencies of our Situation. I own it
lessens them not a little, in my Opinion:, to find
them set an Examp~le the other WNay : But no
Step of theirs shall ·provoke me to forget, that
they are Miniffers of Christ, are good Subjeas~,
and generally Men of Virtue a though I cannot
think this unreasonable Scheme quite coniiftent
withr that Charadter.

We are all sensible, that, especially since thne

Union, our young G~entlewomen· are very ill off.
pFirom their Sex they are debarred from the Ad van-

tagese

193

tages the IMen reap from it, by eftablithing thelrl
selves in our Plantations, the ]Fleet, Army, E3c.
Suppose a Petition was to be offered up to Par-
liamnent in be~half of all the young W~omen and
unprovided Widows of genteel Edtxcationl and
Behaviour, hum~bly begging the Legislature to
take th~eir Cafe under Conficleration, and repre-
fencingi That whereas the great Demand the Pu-
blick has had for young Men in our Wars by
Sea and Land, our Colonies abroad, si3c. they
have not, nor, by the Nature of the Thing, can-
not pat~ibly be provided for by Marriage 3 there-
fore they beg to be allowed an Efitablifhment of
L. 2 o a-year ecSC\ Out Of the Rient of the King-
dom~.

I think a great deal might be filid in support`

of fach a Petition. But what would blow it up at
once is this : - There are at least 2ozooo faclx
young WTomen in the Kingdom, and thre A-
mountt of their D~emand exceeds one half of the
rn taxed landed 'Rent of Scotladnd. Ahnd the An-
zfwer would be f Ladies, since you hav~e the Mif-
fortune to be born in a poor Country, you must
f'ubmit to what NEature seems to have intended a
and corre~t the Incolnveniencies of your Situation,
by Frugality, T~empe~rance, and Patience. There~
are the Ornaments of your Sex in all Countries a
but it is decent in your Circumstances, to make a!
Virtue of N~ceity.

I thall now examine the Reas~ons set forth

in the Pamphlet, and shall follow the Order
in which I find them there,

Reafoa I. The Support and fEducation of a Fa-

m-i-ly is vafflyr more expensive now, than when the
Stipend was Attcled by King Chbarles1I. a hundred

B YKears

[ zo ]

Years ago. At that Time indeed it bore foch a
tolerable Proportiain to the Rates of Thing~s, and
Circumffanlces of the 'Times, that for a while the
M~inisters of the Church of Scotland lived comn-
fortably : B8ut now it must be owned by every
Perfion, that the necef~ary Expence of living is
generally doubled, yea in many Articles near tri-
pled, above what it was then : All Vivers,
Cloath~ing, and Goods of every fort, are valily ri-
fen in their Value; the Wages of Artificers, and
Servants of all kinds, greatly advanced. So that,
on there~ Accounts, the MA~iintenance of a FamTily,
and the Education of Children in any measure
of Decency, according to our Station in the
W~orld, is become impoirble a for the Stipend
in most Parishes does not exceed sixty or sixty five
Pou~nds, and in many not fifty, in some nlot for-
ty, nor even thirty : Sora that an Augm~entationa
seems to be ablolutely necef Fary, if thJofe that serve
at the Alttar, ar-e to live by the Altar. Had our
3Encouragement been af~rgned us in Church-lands,
our Subje~t would have ris~en with the other
La~nds in the Country, and would have kept:
with them a growing Proportion to th~e necessa~ry
Expence of Life ; but our Subje64~ being, slated
and unimprovable, is now greatly left behind its
Vdalue, even in Proportion as the Necessaries of
Life are advanced. The Clergy are the only
Set of Men in Scotlanld, whose Income is not in-
creased with the Expence of the Times. Tfhe
Land-rents are greatly raised, Salaries of all pur
blick Employments considerably augmented, and
the Profits of T~raders and M~echanicks increaited
according~ to the E~xpence of L·iving. Ais for
those Augme~ntiations of Stipend which have beest

granted

granted within there hundred Years, they. have
been but few in Numnber, the AddItions which:
have been made, very inconsiderable, and, of late,
Applications for Augmenta~tions have been geneg
rally rt·ejeed.

An/weer. It is by no means true, that Neceffa-

r~ies are become dearer than they were -Ioo Years
ago. It appears from Bp Fleetwoord's Chronicon
pretiofum, a Book no body thould be without,
that Corn, on the Price of which all other Things
depend, has been cheaper within thes~e 5p Years,
at a M~edium, than in any Period of Time for
t00 Years before. T~Jhe fame Principle appears
from Sir Henary Spelmna~ls Works, published by
Gibforz,on the Article ofCoin? . Cloathing of al
Kinds is cheaper now than in Charles I.'s Time:
Aind W~oollen and Linen Goo0ds, of the fame Qua-
lity, never were to> cheap in Scotland as now. Trhe
Difference is, that Luxury has crept in amongst
ris, and we do not content ourfetlves with what
our Forefathers never aspired to.-No doubt Eng-
h)~5 Broad Cloth is not so cheap as home-s~pun,
nor Holland as L~inen, nor Silk as Stuff: But I
wrill venture to f~ay, with Sir Jo/iah Child, that: no
M/ian of Sense ever chose a Wdife in a Silk Gown,
that he would have rejeAed in W7~orftedl. I am
afraid our Enemies will faBy, the plain EntgliJ of
this first Reason is:-f~ruly it is grolwn the FafFi-
on to be lu~xurious ; and, as the Clergy oukght to have
the Lead on all OccaJfons, mzay it pleafeyoulr Manje-
fly, &c. to pult u i na Condition to vie with thq
best of them~ in it. .

It will be found, that the Aug~mentations ant)

new Creations since the Time mentioned far ex-
ceced the neat Profit on the Improvement of Lands

jn Scotlancd: For it is not fair, where a Man has
laid out a large Sum in improving Land, to state
all that to the Ahccount of Imnprovement. If I lay
out L;. I00 on Land, andc raise my Rent~ only
Lj. I0 a-year, all ·that~ can be Rtatedl as Improve-
mnent, is the odd L. 5 a-year. And I am afraid,
if LZ. ·L per cent, is to be allowed for all the Mlo-
isey laid out on Improvement of Land th:@e re 0
IYears, it will be found our Improvements have
'been bsackwa~rds. And once eftabllifh t~he Princi-
ple, That Stipends are to be increa~sed as· Land
improves, it will be deemed thuch a Tax on Indu·
ftry and Agriculture, as will put a total Stop to it,

I beg to know, w-hether the Pay of an Offticer,

Soldier, and Sailor, is increased within the Time
mnentioned ?a

T~he Augmraentatlons have been reje~ted of late,

becaus~e the Jrudges of the Land thought the Cler-
gy had enough.

Reason II. T~he Parifhkes in Scotland are general-

ly muchi more populoiis, andl confeqluently the
Toils of the Ministerial O8ffice, in visiting, exa-
mtining, baptizing, marry'ing, and attending the
Sick, muc~h greater than when our Encouragement
ivas fixed; our Labours· are greater, and poffirbl~y
more us~eful, both - in a religious and civil Sense~,
tfhan the L~abours -of any Set of ML/en in Scotlaind,
who are so ill paid.

.dfer. It cannot be made out, that Scotlcand is

increased in NJumber of People within there hun-
dlre'd Years·: · But Evidence can easily be broug;ht
to the' contrary a for which one needs but appeal
tio th-eir own Sellion-books.

Reason III. * t is- impossible for us, upon our

~res~eat imtal Income, to maintain that Influence

and

[ zg

and Regard which is due to our Fundtion and Cha-
rad~er. W~ants and Straits naturall~y depress our
Spirits, bring us into a mean1 Dependence on our
Petople:, and greatly ~ink. the Credit of our Office
yivtit those of be~tter R~ank.

An/wer. This is borrowedl from 'fereinzah Col-

lier ; and indeed has been 10 of ten exploded, and
is so liable to Ridicule, that one needs onl~y put
them in mind when it was thaey have had most In-
fluence, and have been most regarded a whether in
the poor, of- wealthy Times of the Church ? and,
whether a good Life and Charaater, or a Coach
and Six, commands mnoft Refpe~t to a Clergy-
man and Philoso~pher ?

Reason IV. T~he Smalnefs of our Stipend is apt

to d~ivide our ~Attention betwixrt the Duties of our
O3ffice, and some fiecular P~rojeat, for maintaining
ourselves in our Station a wher~eby our Thoughts
mruft be diffraated, our Cares divided, and our fa-
cred Labours; become enervated and fruitl~f~s.

ABn/werl: This differs widely f-rom the received

Opinion of all NJations, ancient and mnodern'; not
t~o mention the ancient Philosophers, far Jess the
modern Papifts. This really looks as if the Au-
thor had forgot the Evangelists, the A~s of tEhe
Apolttes, and had never read any Ecclesiast~ical
Hiffory.

Reason V. Our pref'eat Circumstances render us

.incapabjle of that glorious and divine Parte of our
Charader, which consist~s in Kindness, Hoifpitali-
-ty, and good W~orks·; without which the bell:
Sermons and moss afliduous L~abours of the Mig
niftry, will prove in a great measure ineffeafual
with our People, and afford only an unsatisfying
-2l)edursc to ourfdCves. W~ithn wh~at GErace: or Zeal!

Ican r

r 4 1

can we recommnendBeneficence and generous Deeds:
tgo our H~earers, when we want Power to make the
Light of our own Example shine before them ?

~Anferer. This is so ludicrous, that one is at a

Loss how to treat it. T~lhe Sub~je~t is of a serious
Nature; and yet lappeal to every thinking M~an, if
it is here seriously treated a not to take Advantage
of the Indecency of the ExprefiTons, Hofrpitality),
and the Light of our owLPn Ex~ample fine before thema.

What is propofedi~, is, not to augment every

Stipend, but only fouch as are below L. I00 a-year.
Aire fach as have the~appinefs to poffefis that Sum
remarkable for H-3ospitality ? Is it by the Light of
that Virtue that they infirua~ their Flock ? or are
we s~o unhappy in poor Scotlanld, where that Reve-
nue ca~n fall ·but ·to' few People's Share, that a Man
cannot shew a good Example to his Neighbours
~without L. I00 a-year ?

Reajon VI. Were our Encouragement more

considerable, Gentlemen capable of givmng their
Sons a liberal Education, would be more likely
to educate themn for the M~iniftfy ; whereby the
Church would be adorned with able Ministers, and-
the civil Conflitution remarkably strengthened
by their Influence and Connexions.

Acn/ier. This is still founded on a supposed In-

tendion to increase the Revenue of every Mliniffer,
as well as the poorest. Gentlemen, when bred to
the IVini~ffry, never doubt of obtaining a good Li-
Pving, if they have Merit. And I dare fay, it ne-
~ver was an Obje~tion to a Gentleman's breeding
hlis Son to the Church, if he inclined to it other'-
wife, That he was not certain of obtaining one of
the middling Livings for him.

.~eafn VII. If there were fTuch an Augmentar- b10 0

[ I5

tiori made to the Stipends over Scotland, as wrouldS
mnake the M~inisters live with Comfort in their re-:
fpe~tive Parishes, Transportations, with the ma-
nlifold Inconveniencies attending them, would be
in a gr'eat measure prevented.

AnSgeer. This makes greatly against the Scheme.

No body will deny, that it is an Obje~tion, and
Ipehaps the Ifrongeft, against our Church-govertn-
ment, That as there is no Roomn for Preferment
in it, MCen who naturally delight in Eas~e, want
one of the chief M~otives to Application. hi
is a Proposal to take away the only Incitement
left us. Besides, if all Livings were made alike,
it is likely sauch as considered their own Inter-
eft, would make Application,· to quit a labo-
r~ious and populous Chargej- for a fmnall and remote
one. Thus one might expec? to ·fee Translations
from large Towns and Parishes, to the remote
Parts of the Country.

R~eafonz VIII. The Attachment of the Churchn

of Sco~tland to the Rloyal Fam~ily on the Throne,
and to our pref~eat happy Confitiution, has always
Ibeen both dutiful and zealous, particularly in
Times of Rebellion and publick Danger. This
gives us Ground to expedCt a fair Hearing with his
~Majefcy King George, and every honest Whig ine
the ~Britiy Parliarrien t.

Angwer. As to this,. the ]ting is the 1lead of

the C~hurch a but he is likewise the Faither of his
People. It must beconfeffed the Clergy did their
Duty on a late Occasion ; and to dlid the Country
Gentlemen. Such as did o~therwis~e have deferl-
vedly fruffered for it; or have, it is to be hoped,
been s~et right. by his IVajeftyjs Clemeilcy. The
Country Gentlem~en have fuffered greatly by the
Rebellion, from the double Taxes they pai~d in

m~Ost:

isoft Counties durihg that unhappy Pai idd~~;'thij

ta~lLofs of thbit~~~~ttt~~r-P·~rop erty. Ido not knlow that
