T H E author of the following Tragedy, has;

in his former attempts of the fame kind;

avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication

or preface. His chief reafdn for declining this
commor mode of appearing before the public~
was the necessity, Which it would lay him under,
of speaking concerning himself and his works;
The success of Alonzo calls upon him to depart
from his former plan; and to break that silence,
which might now be reckoned arrogant, and even
ungrateful, to those, from whom he in a great
measure derives his success:

He embraces with pleasure, this occasion, to

acknowledge his obligations to THE MANAGERS of
the theatre, whose friendly, anxious, and active
zeal he hath so often experienced: To THE PER-
FORMERS, who have so firenuoufly contended with
each other, in their very generous endeavours to
embellilh the representation of the piece: To
MRS. BARRY-but the public voice has exalted
HER above his praise: Yet he claims the merit of

A 2 having,
21

having, before others, observed her now allowed

and unrivalled excellencr From the colour of
the da.wn, he foretold the brightness of the day.

For MRS.- BARRY he wrote the part of Ormi-

finda, and the most flattering circumfrance to him,
in the success of his play, is the universal opinion,
(vouched, not only by the loudest applause that
ever {hook the fCage, but by the greatest effusion
of tears) that the AcrREass f much exalted THE
CHARACTER, that ffe exceeded all imagination,
and reached the summit of perfection.

*ORMISINDA. TERESA.

ORMISINDA.
~IZr HI S roll contains the secret of my life;

And of the 'tate: My marriage with

i. ~

E i Alonzo,

The tfory of my son, my injured child,
Bred in a:defert, tho' the heir of Spain.
To thee, my faithful friend, my lov'd Teresa!
This precious record I commit. Oh! keep it
From fight of human eye, till better times:

B For

For still I hope that better times may comes
Tho' not to me. to this afflicted land.
My hand hath signed it, and my ac to day
Shall give it faith and credence with mankind,
This will explain the mystery of my fate,
And tell the world why Ormifinda died.

[Gives the writing.]

TERESA.
Do not too soon despair.

ORMTSIN UA.

I wait the last

Decisive moment. Bur to guard my foul
Against the sallies of a ralh despair, -
Against the weakness which attends surprise,
I have forecast whatever may befall,
And fram'd to the event my sinn resolve.
This is the day appointed for the combat,
Between a Moorish and a Christian knight,
To end the wars of Spain, and fix the fate
Of the contending nations.

TERESA.

Antient times,

If tales of antient times may be believ'd,
Have known such combats. In her infant tatec
Against her rival Alba, Rome was pledg'd
As now Afturia is: But later times-
Afford no parallel.

ORMISINDA.

There never was,

Nor will there ever, while the world endures,
Be found a parallel to my distress--
I am the vi&or's prize-whoe'er prevails
He gains the princess, and the crown of Spain.
Such is the foleinn treaty, sworn, confirm'd,
By every rite, which either nation owns.
Mean while I am Alonzo's wedded wife-
I am a mother-by the false Alonzo,
Who from his hate to me abandons Spain,
Which he alone can save. No other arm
Can match Mirmallon's force. Proud of his itrength
Already in the lifts the Moor exults,
Secure of vi&ory. The letting fun
Concludes the dreadful period of fufpence,
And death alone from infamy can save me.

TERESA.

He yet may come. Far in the Nubian wilds,
That guard the secret sources of the Nile,
Velafco found the chief. The wind of spring,
The constant East, this year forgot its season,
And only since this moon her light renew'd,
Began to blow upon the western ihore,
On that I build a hope,

ORMISINDA;

I have no hope !
Review the story of my .life, Teresa,

B 2 And

And by the past conjeture of the future.
First my lamented brother, blindly led
By proud Ramirez, quarrell'd with Alonzo,
,Then by Alonzo's sword Ramirez fell.
For that offence to banilhment condemn'd,
Alonzo won me to accept his hand
Before he left this kingdom. Since that time,
What I havefuffer'd, Heav'n, and you can tell,
It was the fifth, a memorable day,
After our marriage, when he fail'd to come,
At the appointed place to meet his. bride.
Then 'midst my fear, anxiety, and sorrow,
For only death I thought, or dangerous harm,
Could keep him from.my arms, amaz'd I:heard
That he was gone for Asia. To this hour,
Ev'n to this present hour, no cause affign'd
But there diftrafted lines long after lent:
"Thou never shalt behold Alonzo more;
" The foul, foul cause thy gilty conscience knows."
My conscience knows no cause, so help me Heav'n!
Now, in my utmost need, this dreadful day,
When I muff struggle with despair and Death,
To keep myself a chaste, a blameless wife,
And to my silent grave the secret bear,
That my dear son and his may live to wield
The sceptre of his fathers !

TERESA.

To this hour,
Tiy husband knows not that he is a father,

ALONZ^
ORMISINDA.

fIis ears, his eyes are shut. Oft' have I sent
Letters, that would have. pierc'd an heart of stone;
Pleading for pity, begging but to know,
Wherein I had unwittingly offended:
But every letter, with unbroken feal,
To me return'd. He will not read one word
From my defited hand.

TERESA.

'Tis very strange,

And much unlike the way of other men.
For tho' they are inconstant in their love,
There is a course and process in the change.
Ardent at first, their ardor lasts not long.
With easy, full, secure pofeffion cloy'd,
Their passion palls, and cold indifference comes,
As chilly autumn steals on summer's prime,
Making the green leaf yellow. Then it is
That some new beauty takes their roving eyes,
And fires their fancy with untafted charms.
But in a moment, from excess of love,
To the extreme of hate Alonzo pass'd
Without a cause. Nor did another come
Between thee and the current of his love.
'Tis moon-Riruck madness, or the dire effe&
Of incantation, charm, compulsive spell,
By magic faften'd on his wretched foul.
It can be nothing else.

ORMISINDA.

Whate'er it is,

He lhuns all woman-kind. His life is spent
In war and in devotion. When the field
Is won, the warrior lays aside his spear,
Takes up the pilgrim's staff, and all alone,
Obfcur'd in:homely weeds, he bends his course
To some remote, religious, holy place,
Where he exceeds the strictest penitent,
In penances severe and fad austerity.
Sometimes in deeper melancholy wrapt
He loaths the fight of man, and to the cliffs
Of hoary Caucasus or Atlas flies,
Where all the dreary winter he remains
And, desolate, delights in desolation,
My faithful servant Juan saw him once
Upon the ledge of Atlas; on a rock
Beside the empty channel of a brook,
He stood and gaz'd intent a catara&
Which, as it tumbled from a cliff, the blast
Had caught mid-way, and froze before it fell.
Juan drew near and call'd, He turn'd abaut,
Look'd at him for a space, then wav'd him back,
And mounting swiftly funk behind the hill,
Wan was his face, and like a statue pale !
His eye was wild and haggard ! Oh ! Teresa,
Amidst my woes, my miseries, my wrongs!
My bosom bleeds for him!

TERESA.
Something there is

Mysterious and unfathomable here,
Which passes human wisdom to divine.
The hand of fate is on the curtain now.
Within my breast a firm persuasion dwells,
That in the lifts Alonzo will appear.
Behold in haste the king your father comes,
And seems the rfieffenger of welcome tidings,

Enter the K I N G,

KING.

I come in this alarming hour; my child,
To pour a ray of comfort on thy heart.
A valiant Moor, once captive of my sword,
And ever since, my firm but secret friend,
Acquaints me that a champion is at hand,
Shunning those honors which the Moors would pay::
Dark and referv'd he travels thro' their towns
Without a name. I judge it is Alonzo,
For the description best accords with him.
Scorning his foes, offended with his fiiends,
Shrouded in anger and in deep disdain,
Like some prime planet in eclipse he movesy
Gaz'd at and sear'd.

ORMISINDA.

It is! It is Alonzo!

Welcome, moss welcome, in whatever shape,
The hero comes to save his native lands
To. save the honor of the Christian name,

And

And o'er the fading crescent of the Moo:'
Exalt the holy cross.

KING.

And, ev'n as thine

Is the consenting voice of all the land.
The hope of Spain on brave Alonzo refts.
In this I fee the ruling hand of heav'n,
Which to its own eternal purpose leads,
By winding paths, the steps of erring man !
Painful it were to speak of those events
Sad and disastrous which have laid us low,
Unjustly was Alonzo banifh'd hence,
And happily the hero now returns.
For since my son, your valiant brother, fell,
With an impartial mind I have enquir'd
And trac'd the story of Alonzo's birth.
He is the offspring of our antient kings,
The rightful heir of Riccaredo's line,
Called the Catholic, who reign'd in Spain
Before the first invasion of the Moors.
Loft in the gen'ral wreck, buried and hid
Beneath the ruins of a fallen Rate,
Obscure, unknown, the royal infant lay,
When I, indignant of a foreign yoke,
In wild Afturia rose againlf the Moors.
The righteous cause prevail'd ; the baffled for:
Retir'd, and left us and our mountains free.
The grateful people chore their leader king.

i' ki e1i

I knew nor then, nor did my' people know,
Ought of A.onzo?

OR MISIINDA.

I have heard him own

Ti'hejuftice of.thy title to command
And rule the fiate thy valor had reftor'd,
Enough; he said, remain'd .!or him to conquer'
The fertile provinces of ample Spain,
Which Rill the Moor usurp:.

KINC.

3f all mankind,

He is the champlori whom my foul desires
This day to fight for Spain and for my daughter
Not only for his great renown in arms,
But for his birth, his lineags, and his blood.
If his unconquer'd arm in fight prevails,
The antient monarchy fliall rife again,
In all its splendor and c'ten: of empire.
The itreams of royal blood divided now,
Shall roll a tide united thro' the land,

ORMISINDA.'

Thy heart dilates with pleasing hopes, my father
And fond anticipates its own desire.
But who can tell the purpof~ of Alonzo ?
His strange approach no friendly afpedt bears:
He comes the foe determin'd of the Moors,
But not to us a friend.

KING.

Of that no fears

I know him proud, impetuous, and fierce,
Haughty of heart, and high of hand: Too prompt,
On all occasions to appeal to arms.
But he was ever gentle to my daughter:
The proud Alonzo bow'd the knee to thee.
At his departure I obferv'd thy grief,
And in my mind -

(A truimpet founds.)

ORMISINDA.
What means that shout of war

KING.
The yumpet founds to arms.

(Enter a ?nefenger.)
MESSENGER.

Thy presence, Sir,

Is at the camp requir'd. Both nations arm,
And rulh to battle: Loud the Moors complain
Of violated faith. A Spanish knight
They fay has broke the treaty, and attack'd
Their bands, of peace secure.

KING.

'Tis basely done

Command my guards to meet me at the gate.
FareweL

[Exit the King,

TERESA.

Who can this headlong warrior be ?

Too well Alonzo knows the laws of war,
Too much reveres the treaty seal'd and sworn,
To make a ram attempt upon the Moors.

ORMIS INDA.

If it is he, 'tis no deliberate a&,
No treacherous intention to iffail
The Moors unguarded, Yet it may be he;
My mind misgives me that it is Alonzo.
Ill would his swelling spirit brook the fight
Of Moorifo tents and arms on yonder plain.
if as he pass'd, one flighting word was dropt,
With tenfold scorn to that he would reply,
Nor hesitate alone to draw his sword
Amidst an host of Moors,

TERESA.

The clamor finks.

Whate'er it was, the tumult is appeas'd.
And now what does my Orrnifiada think
Of my predicions ?

ORMISIND A.

01O! rnm dear Teresa !

Thy fond desire to chear my hopeless heart
Makes thee forever to my iind present
The fairet fide of things.

C ^

.TERESA.

-' .... :IHa! doff thou doubt
Still of his coming ?

ORMIS lNDBA.

No, I think 'is he

But hope and fear alternate. sway my mind:
Like light and shade upon a waving field .
Courting each other, when the flying clouds
Now hide and now .reveal the fun of heav'n.
I tremble for the issue of 'the combat;;
And if my Lord should, as I hope, prevail,
I tremble for myself: Afraid to fee,
Tho' iick with firong impatience to behold him,
Andlearn why he foriook his Ormifinda.
He fays I know the cause. .Oh ! most unjuf
Was it because I lov'd him to excess,
Altho' his title .shook my father's throne ?
Was it because I join'd my fate to his,
And fondly chore to .wed a banifh'd man ?
For such .are my demerits,,

TERE'SA.

'Tis but vain

Thus to torment thyself, and rack thy mind
With fad conjetures, at a time like this,
3¥hen the reality will soon be known.

ORMISINDA.

I know one thing that's real, 'tis a fault,
An imperfeaion which I cannot cure;

Six ~se;-;:

Sixteen long years are paftb-ince I beheld him,
And grief and care, those tenants that deface
The fad and weary rmanfion.they'inhab)t;
Have dwelt Wi'ith me. Am' I. iot alter'd much ?
The ghflt and shadow of.What once I was ?

TERESA.

No, Ormfifinda, I perceive no change;
That in the'leaft impairs thy lovely form.
The beam that gilds the,early morn of youth
Yields to the fplerdor ds a iiper hour:
The rose that was so fair in bud, is blown
And grief and care, tho' they have dwelt with thee,
Have left no traces of their visitation,
But an impreflion sweet of melancholy
Which captivates the foul. Unskilful they
Who dress the queen of love in wanton fiiles:
Brightest (he Ihines amidst a fhow'r of tears;
The graces that adorn her beauty moll,
Are softness, sensibility, and pity.

ORMISINDA.

Oh! how ingenious thou art, Teresa,
How subtle to elude my simple fears !
Still they advance and gather round my heart.
If nothing can recal Alonzo's love,
Let him but own his son, and I'll renounce
The title of his wife, and of a queen;
Then in a convent hide me and my sorrows.
The faddeil sifter of the holy train,

2 Whose

-V.7hofe watchful zeal prevents the midnight bell,
Shall find me kneeling on the marble floor.
Oh! it will be the luxury of grief,
To weep inceliant in the vaulted cell,
To lift my hands, and fend my vows to heav'n,
Invoking ev'ry power that dwells above,
To guard and bless my husband and my ion !
Perhaps some friend, mol- likely my Teresa,
When I am quite forsaken and forgot
By all the world, will still remember me ;
Will come and tell me of Alonzo's wars;
Tell how my boy in his first battle fought,
At once the rival of his father's fame.

This morning on my in 'd to Ovicdo

1? wile

A while I halted near a Moorilh pot.
Of the commander I enquir'd my way,
And told my purpose, that I came to fee
The famous combat. With a scornful smile5
With taunting words and gestures he replied,
Mocking my youth. Advis'd me to return
Back to my father's house, and in the ring
To dance with boys and girls. He added too
That I flould fee no combat. That no knight
Of Spain durst meet the champion of the Moore.
Incens'd I did indeed retort his scorn.
The quarrel grew apace, and I defied him,
To a green hill, which rose amidst the plain,
An arrow's flight or farther from his polt.
Alone we sped: at once we drew, we fought.
The Moorifl captain fell. Enrag'd his men
Flew to revenge his death. Secure they came
Each with his utmost speed. Those who came first
Single I met and flew. More wary grown
The reft together join'd, and all at once
Assail'd me. Then I had no hopes of life.
But suddenly a troop of Spaniards came
And charg'd my foes, who did not long sustain
The fliock, but fled, and carried to their camp
That false report which thou, 0 King! haft heard.

,KING.

Now by my sceptre, and my sword, I swear,
Thou art a noble youth. An angel's voice

3 Could

Could not command a more implicit faith"
Than thou from me haft:'gain'd. What think'ft

thou, Hamet ?
Is he not greatly wrong'd ?

HAMET.

By Allah! yes.

The voice of truth and innocence is bold,
And never yet could guilt that tone assume.
I take my leave impatient to return,
And satisfy my friends that this brave youth
Was not th' aggressor.

KING.

I expet no less
From gen'rous Hamet.

[Exit Hamet and. Moors. ]

KING. -. .; .;.
Tell me, wondrous:;Youth.!'

For much I long to know; what is thy name.?ce..
Who are thy parents ? Since the Moor prevail'dr':-
The cottage and the cave have oft'. concealld: .

-,

From hostile hate the noblest blood of Spain:
Thy Ipirit speaks for thee. Thou art a shoot
Of some illustrious stock, - fme hoble h6oie '
Whose fortunes with their falling country fell.

YOUTH.

Alberto is my name. I draw my birth- -
From Catalonia; in the mountains there

D2 My

My father. dwells,: and for his own domains
Pays tribute to the Moor. He was a soldier;
Oft' I have heard him of your battles speak,
Of Cavadonga's and Olalles' field.
But ever since I can remember ought,
His chief employmentand delight have been
To train me to the use and love of arms;
In martial exercise we pall the day;
Morning and evening, itill the theme was war.
He bred me to endure the summer's heat,
And brave-the winter's cold: To swim across
The headlong torrent, when the shoals of ice
Drove down the itream. To rule the fiercest fleed
That on our mountains run. No savage beast
The forest yields that I have not encounter'd.
Meanwhile my bosom beat for nobler game;
I long'd in arms to meet the foes of Spain.
Oft I implor'd my- father to permit me,
Before the truce was made, to join the host.
He-faid it must ot be, I was too young
For the rude feryice of there trying times.

KING.
Did he permit you now?

ALBERTO.

A firange adventure

Forc'd me from home. Not many days ago,
When hunting in the woods, I heard a voice,

A woman's

A woman's voice, calling aloud for help.
I ruih'd into the thicket; there I saw
A Moorish LQrd, for brutal licence fam'd,
Who ihamefully abus'd a rural maid
Of Spaniih race. I free'd her from his arms.
The Moor spake not a word, but mad with rage
Snatch'd up his lance, which flood against a tree,
And at me flew. I turn'd his point aside,
And with a slender javelin pierc'd his heart.
I haffen'd home, but did not find my father;
Nor was it safe to wait for his return.
I took the fairest armour in the hall,
And hither bent my course. The ress thou know'ft.

KING.

Thou art a prodigy, and fill'ft my mind
With thoughts profound and expectation high.
When in a nation, humbled.by the will
Of Providence, beneath an haughty foe,
A person rifes up, by nature rear'd,
Sublime, above the level of mankind
Like that bright bow, the hand of the m6os High
Bends in the wat'ry cloud: He is the sign
Of profp'rous change and interposing Heav'n
And thou, if right I read-

(Enter Mle2lenger.)
MESSENGER.

The champion, Sir,
Who comes to fight for Spain, is near athand:

One

One of our-fcouts has feen'him and his train,
But brings a strange report, which damps the heart
Of ever;-Spaniard. It is not Alonzo.

KING.

What fay'ft thou ? God of heaven ! Not Alonzo !
Whois he then ?

MESSENGER.

That is not fully known.

Clad in the flowing veflure of the east,
A Persian turban on his head he wears,
Yet he's a christian knight. To mark his faith,
Holy, and adverse to Mohammed's law,
Before his steps a silken banner borne
Streams in the wind, and thews a golden cross.

KING.
Send out another scout.

MESSENGER.

There is not time
To go and to return.

KING.

Begone, begone,

And let me be obey'd. Alas! my hopes
Are vanish'd like a dream.

ALBERTO.

I grieve to fee
The king- afflited,

KING.

Ah! Thou dost not know
How deep there tidings strike.

ALBERTO.

Is not the king

Free to accept or to refute the aid
This stranger offers ?

KING.

If I am, what then?

ALBERTO.

Be not offended, Sir, at my presumption,
For fiom my heart I speak, a loyal heart,
True to my fov'reign and my native land.
If this is not Alonzo, why should he,
Or any stranger fight the cause of Spain ?
Are there not warriors born of Spanilh race,
Who court the combat ?

KING.

To my words attend.

The Moorish champion is of great renown,
In stature like the giant race of old,
Like Anak's true, or Titan's fabled sons.
Against the foe nor sword nor spear he lifts,
But in his might secure, a mace he wields,
Whose fiay resistless breaks both shield and arm,
And crushes head and helmet. Thus he fights,

Whore

Whose fatal prowess turn'd the doubtful scale
Of three successive battles. He is deem'd
Invincible but byAlonzo's arm
Therefore our warriors, tho' they know no fear,
No fear of ought that can themselves befal,
Anxious for Spain, to great Alonzo yield,
And on his valour reft.

ALBERTO.

Oft' have I heard

My father speak of brave Alonzo's deeds;
What can with-hold him when his country calls?
Perhaps the last .of combats he has fought,
And in the silent tomb the hero relts.
But, since he's absent, from whatever cause,
0 ! let no itranger knight his place assume,
To bring dishonour on the Spanish name.
If this gigantic champion of the Moors,
Clad in the glory of his battles won,
Dazzles the warriors, and confounds their valour;
Let me, tho' young in arms, the combat claim,
On me his fame has no impression made.
I'll meet the giant with a fearless heart,
It beats for battle now. Oft have I kill'd
The wolf, the boar, and the wild mountain bull,
For sport and pastime. Shall this Moorilh dog
Resist me fighting in my country's cause ?

KING.
By heaven and earths thou mov'ft me much!- thy

words

Have itirr'd the embers of my youthful fire.
Thou mak'ff me wish I could recal those days,
When of an age like thine, ahd not unlike
To thee in face and formt I rais'd the spear
Against the Moort, in Cava's bloody field.
Then by my hand the great Alchammon fells
The strength and pillar of the Caliph's host.
Then I was fit to meet Mirmallon's arm.
But now, my hairs are grey, my steps are flow/
My sword descending breaks the shield no more;
Our foes have known it long _

ALBERTO.

O! King, thou art

Thy counttrys-great dellv'rer, and the sole
Restorer of the fcate. Pelagio's fame
Shall never die: But let thy counsel now
(As oft thy valour) save: this land from hamne.
Let not a foreign warrior take the field,
And snatch the glory from the lance of Spain,

KING.

My voice alone cannot determine that.
The council fit assembled near the lifts,
To them I will present thee. If this knight
Unknown, who from that distant region comes,
Where the bright fun lights up his golden lamp,
Bears not some high pre-eminence about him,

E Which

Which marks him -ut- our surest safest choice,
v.My voice:is for. a Spaniard, and for thee!

- . ALBERTO.

Upon my.knees, that ne'er were bow'd before
To'rnortalman, I thank thee!

; . . . KING.

.: .. . . Rife, Alberto!

To me'no thanks -are due. A greater King,
The ing of Kings, -I deem hath chosen thee
To be the champion of his law divine
Ag'aiif-the Infidel.-If not for this,
FrF-foimi:great pwpofe fire thou art ordain'd.
Bred in the desert, and by heav'n.endued
With force and valor marvellously great,
Conduaed by a hand unseen, thyself
Not knowing whither, and.this day.produc'd
Before the nations.

ALBER'T O.

:-.- . Ah! my foul's on fire!

Should such a glorious destiny be mine l
May-:I:treat to go without delay ?
I fear some gallant warrior may rsep forth
And claim the fight before me.

Stay, Sebastian,
And to my daughter tell what has befall'n.

How'many changes mark this awful day!
What muff the Princess susser ! Well I know
That ihe above all others wish'd Alonzo.

Enter OR M ISINDA and T ERE SA.

TERESA.

It is a false report. In times like these
The minds of men are credulous and weak:
To rumor's shifting blast they bow' and bend,
Like corn of slender reed to every wind.
Thou know'ft that from the East Alonzo comes.
Might not the haffy messenger mistake.
For him some turban'd warrior'of his train?

ORMISINDA.

O ! good Sebastian, canst thou tell me ought ?
Is it Alonz ?

SEBASTIAN.

If report Ipeaks truth,
And so the King believes, 'tis not Alonzo.

ORMISIND A.
Then I am loft, Teresa.

TERESA.

Halt thou heard,
If not Alonzo, who this stranger is ?

SEBASTIAN.

His garb bespeaks him native of the Eaf.
But from whatever clime the warrior comes,

E I hope,

I hope, my Princess ! that he comes in vain,
Another warrior, and of Spanish race,
Now claims the combat for his native land.

ORMISINDA.
Of Spanish race ! Who is this Knight of Spain ?

SEBASTIAN.

A wonder! never was his equal seen,
For daring valour and address in arms.
He has not yet attain'd the prime of youth,
His look partakes more of the boy than man,
But he hath vanquifh'd men. This day the Moors
Have felt his hand.

ORMISINDA.

Ha! Is it he, Sebastian,
Who was the author of the late alarm ?

SEBASTIAN.
S-he fame.

ORMISINDA.
And whence does this young hero come ?

SEBASTIAN.

From Catalonia. In the deserts there
His fire, obscure, tho' once a warrior, dwells.

ORMISINDA.

From Catalonia! In the desert bred!
Teresa! All that's poifible I fear:
What if this youth-

TERESA. [To Ormifda.]

O ! think how many youths

Of Spanish race in Catalonia dwell.
Be recplleCted whilst I ask Sebastian
A question that at once all doubt resolves.

[To SebaJiian.]

Has this youth no name ? Haft thou not heard
How he is call'd ?

SEBASTIAN.

He calls himself Alberto,

QRMIS N PD A.
Mother of God!

TERESA. [To Her.]

Beware !- The Princess grieves,

[To SeCaliain.]

That Spain depriv'd of great Alonzo's aid,
Should reft her safety on a stripling's arm.

ORMISINDA,

No judge of warriors or of combats I; '
But sure this youth, tho' ne'er so brave and bold,
Of tender years, who has not reach'd his prime,
Is most unfit to cope with strong Mirmallon.

SEBASTIAN.

Heroes must not be judg'd by common rules.
Irregular like comets in their course,
Who can compute the period when they mhine?
Lady! If thou had'st seen this gallant youth,
If thou had'st heard him, when oblig'd to speak,

In

In felf-deferice, he told-his wond'rous deeds,
As if he thought them nothing: Thy faint heart
Would from his.fre have caught the flame of hope,
Thou would'st, even as thy royal father did,
Believe he was created and ordain'd,
By Heav'n supreme, the champion of his country.

TERESA.

Sebastian, go, and find this gallant youth.
Tell him, the Princess, partial to the brave,
Desires his presence.

SEBASTIAN.

Gladly I obey.
[Exit SE BASTI AN.]

ORMISINDA.

He's gone. Now I may speak. My son! my son!
My hope, my comfort, in deipair and death!
The only star in my dark sky that shone!
Must thy unhappy mother live to fee
Thy light extinguifh'd ? -I will not permit
This mot unequal combat. I'll proclaim
My fatal story, and declare his birth.

TERESA.
Think what must follow. Absolute perdition!

OR MISIND A.

Is not his death perdition ? Can he meet
The Moor and live ? How mhould his tender youth
Resist the giant, who has overthrown

Squadrons entire,. and trampled on the.necks-
Of firmest warriors?-

To gain the suffrage of the ?ee'r of Spain,
When'once that name'is known.

Teresa, no.

' My fate has still one even tenor held,
From bad to worse. When I had fram'd my mind
To one disaster, then a greater came.
I had made death familiar-to my thoughts;
I could embrace the fpecre like a friend:
But fill I .kept a corner of:my heart
Safe and untouch'd. My dearest child was there
Amidit .the ruins of the wife and queen,
The mother stood secure. 0 thou Alonzo!
If yet thine eyes behold the light of day,
What sorrow and remorse must be thy portion,
When thou shalt hear-Now promise me, Teresa,
That when-my son and I are laid in dust,
(For each event accelerates our doom)
Thou wilt seek out and find this cruel man.
Tell him-howSpain, the kingdom ofshis fathers,
By him deserted, was for ever loft:

'How

How his foriaken wife iii honour died-
But that's not much-for me he will not rmotilfi
Then tell him of his son, to wring hislieart !
Truly describe the boy!: how brave he was !
How beautifiul! -how from the cloud obscure
In which hiscareful mother had involv'd him,
He burst the champion of his native land:
Then tell hinm how the springing hero fell
Beneath a'ftronger arm, fighting for Spain, ,
And for his mother; fighting with the foe
His father should have fought, and could have

vanquifh'd !

TERESA.
Sebastian comes.

Enter SEBASTIAN.

SEBASTIAN.

All is revers'd again:

The firanger knight is for Abdallah known,
The Persian prince, Alonzo's chosen friend,
His only equal in the strife of arms.
To him the combat is decided.

ORMISINDA.

I know

His story well; he is the Sophy's son,
The eldest born and Persia's rightful heir;
But by his mother's zeal a Christian bred:
True to his faith, he loft his father's throne.
What fays he of Alonzo ?

SEBASTIAN.

Sent by himn

the brave Abdallah comes to fight for Spain.
They march'd together, from the falls of Nile
To Damietta. There a wound receiv'd
In Asia's wars broke out; and forc'd Alonzo,
Full of. regret, in Egypt to remain.
His friend.for him appears, The king, thy fathers
With all his peers, in honour of the princes
Go forth to meet him.

ORMISIND A.

Haft thou seen Alberto ?

SE ASTIA,4N.

I haves and told him what I had ih charge;
Then hasten'd hither to report these tidings;
At which Alberto droops.

TERESA.

Return, I pray,

To my apartmient guide the young Alberto.
The princess will be there. [Exit Sebastian.]

Did not I fay;

Alonzo never would' abandon Spain ?
Abdallah comes to conquer in his name.
Now I can read the characters of fate,
And spell the will of Heav'n. This boy of yours
Will win your husband back. When he beholds
The image of his valour so express,
His heart will melt. The husband and the father
Fill rush upon him with a flood of joy.

ORMISINDA.

Is he not like him ? Mark his coming forth f
Behold Alonzo in his daring son'!
Full of the fpiric of his warlike fire,
His birth unknown, he felt his princely mind,
Advanc'd undaunted on the edge of war,
And claim'd the pot-of danger for his own.

TERESA.

A mother's tongue cannot exceed the truth
in praising him. There never was a prince,
Since old Iberia first exceli'd in arms,
Broke out with so much lustre on mankind.
But in this interview, with prudence check
The transport of affection from thy son.
Cautious conceal the secret of his birth.
Safefl he is, while to himfelfr unknown.

OR MISINDA.

How could his faithful guardian let him go .
Perhaps that faithful guardian lives no more;

SCENE I.
A view of the country near the cily.

Eniter ABDALLAH.
O ! CITY! once the feat of all I lov'd!

O! hills and dales'! haunts of my youthful

days!

0! scenes well known! unalter'd you remain.
But I approach you with an alter'd mind,
Hate what I lov'd, and loath what I defir'd.
Intolerable slate ! My foul is void !
A chaos without form. Why, nature, why !
Art thou bo watchful o'er the brutal tribes,
And yet so careless of the human race.
By certain inftint beasts and birds difeern
Their proper food: For them the fairest fruit
Untouch'd, if pois'nous, withers on the bough:
But man, by a fair outside, fiill deceiv'd,
And by his boafled reason more betray'd,
Gives the affcttion of his foul to beauty,
Devours the deadly bane.

Enter VELASCO.

My Lord ! Thy people,
Where thou commanded'fi, halt, and wait thy

coming.

F 2

ABDALLAH.'

'Tis well! I wisi'd to speak with-thee alone.
Velafco ! tho' to thee but little known,
I did in part reveal my secret foul,
Told thee the feign'd Abdallah was Alonzo.
Further than that, thou haft not fought to know,
Tho' many a lonely hour we two have worn
On sea and shore, that some men would have thought
Most opportune.

VELASCO.

My Lord ! There are some men

Who having once been trusted with a little,
Avail themselves of that, some more to learn,
And penetrate the bosom of a friend,
Even with the wedge his uneasiness had furniih'd-.
Such men should not be trusted.

ABDALLAH.

True, Velaco !

But thou art not like them: I have obferv'd thee,
Warm in affection, but in temper cool:
A steady judgment guides thee thro' the world.
Thy gen'rous mind pursues the path of honour,
Unbiafs'd and unmov'd.

VELASCO.

From early youth,

The chcfen confident of my companions,
1 never yet from perfidy betray'd,
From babling vanity, divulg'd a secret.

ABDALLAH.

I have a tale to tell, that will amaze,
Confound, and strike thee dumb. The deserts vagt
Of Asia and of Africa have heard it.
The rocky cliffs of Caucasus and Atlas
Have echo'd my complaints: But never yet
The human ear receiv'd them. Thou haft heard
Already more than ever mortal did.
Thou know'ft the princess ?

VELASCO.

Ormifinda!
ABDALLAH.

Her.

VELASCO.

Not many of the court have been more honour'd
With opportunities to know her worth;
And there is none who more her worth reveres.

ABDALLAH.

Her worth ! Thou may'st as well revere a fiend,
The blackest fiend, that dwells in burning hell,
Is not more opposite to all that's good
Than Ormifinda.

VELASCO.

What a strain is this ?

ABDALLAH.

ITis true, by every high and holy. name,
That binds a soldier's and a prince's vow:

I swear,

3g A L O N Z 0.
I swear, Velafco, she's the vilest Woman
That e'er difgrac'd her sex. The most abandon'd,
The hardieft, most determin'd in her vice,
That ever wrong'd a fond believing heart.

VELASCO.
Great God!

ABDALLAH.

You flart and ihudder like a man
Struck with a heavy blow.

VELASCO.

And so I am.

ABDALLAH.

And now you lift your eye-lids up and flare
With looks full of conjecture and suspicion,
As if you doubted of my fober mind.'
I am not mad, Velafco, tho' sometimes
I have been near, yes, very near to madness;
By that bad woman craz'd.

VELASCO.
0! Would to heav'n !

That this afflicing moment of my life
iVere a delirious dream! Unreal all
That's heard and spoken now! But how, my Lord,
Art thou so much asseted by her crimes

ABDALLAH.
I am her husband.

VELASCO.
Heav'n for that be prais'd !

ABDALLAH.

How dar'ft'thou thus profane the name of heav'n,
And mock my misery ? Thou art mad, I thinl;
Thefrenzy which thou wilhed'ft has come upon thee.
Beware, for if this extafy endures,
My sword secures thy silence.

VELASCO.

O ! forgive me,

Noble Alonzo, royal, I should fay,
Doubly my master now. There's not a man,
Whose veins contain one drop of Spanish blood,
Who does not wish thee wedded to the princess.
And for her virtue ! Thou haft long been absent,
And know'ft not what an angel's life she leads!
Referv'd, retir'd, and fad. I'll flake my fou!,
Some villain has belied thy faithful wife,
And fnar'd thy easy faith.

ABDALLAH.

Take heed, take heed !

I am the villain who accuse the princess,
And thou shalt be her judge.

VELASCO.

Eternal power!
What fliould I'think of this ?

ABDALLAH.

Lissen to me:

I have perplex'd thee, and have marr'd the ftlry
By my abruptneis. 'Tis a serious story,
Not to be told in parcels and by starts,
As I from impotence of mind began,
But I will bear my swelling paflion dowvn,
And utter all my fiame. Thou dolt remermbel
How I was banilh'd from my native land ?

VELASCO.
For killing young Ramirez.

AB D ALLAH.

At that time

I doated on the princess. She conjur'd me
With earnef pray'rs, with deluges of tears,
Not to resist her father, nor advance
My better title to the crown of Spain,
As I had once refolv'd. My rage the footh'd ;
Pride, anger, int'refi, yielded all to love.
With her I made a merit of obedience,
And pleaded so effec&ally my cause,
That she consented to a private marriage,
Before I left the kingdom. We were married,
And met together, four successive nights,
In the sequestered cottage of the wood,
Behin.l the palace garden. O ! I thought
Myfe;f the happiest and the most belov'd.
Of all mankind. She mock'd me all the while;

Meant
2

Meant me the cover of her loose amours,
A cloak to hide her shame. 0 God! 0 God !
Did I deserve no better?

VELASCO.

Good my Lord!

What circumstance to warrant such conclusion ?
What evidence ?

ABDALLAH.

The evidence of fight-
Mine eyes beheld: I saw myself difhonour'd.

VELASCO.
Your eyes beheld !

ABDALLAH.

By Heav'n and Hell-they did.

The night preceding the appointed day
Of my departure, from the realm of Spain,
I flew impatient to the place of meeting,
Before the hour was come: To wear away
The tedious time, for ev'ry minute feem'd
An age to me, I struck into the wood
And wander'd there, still steering to the gate
By which she was to enter. Thro' the trees
The moon full orb'd in all her glory shone.
My am'rous mind a sportful purpose form'd,
Unseen to watch the coming of my bride,
And wantonly furprize her. Near the gate
There stood an aged tree. It was a beech,
Which far and wide ftretch'd forth its level arms

G Low,

Low, near the ground, and form'd a gloomy .ihace.
Behindjits trunk I took my secret stand;
The gate was full in view., and the green path
On which it open'd. There I flood awhile,
And soon I heard the turning of the key.
Myheart beat thick withjoy-and forth he canme:-
Not as I wish'd: She had a minion with her;
A handsome youth was tripping by her fide,
Girt with a sword, and drefs'd in gay attire.
He feem'd to court her, as they pass'd along,
Coy; but not angry, for I heard her laugh.
She flung away. He follow'd, fodn o'ertook her,
Embrac'd her-

VELASCO.
Ah! The Princess Ormifinda!

ABDALLAH.

I drew my sword, that I remember well,
And then an interval like death ensued.
*When consciousness return'd, I found myself
Stretch'd at my length upon the naked ground
Under the tree: My sword lay by my fide.
The sudden ficck, rhe transport of my rage,
And grief, had flopt the current of my blood,
And made a pause of life.

VELASCO.

Alas! my Lord!

-Twas piteous indeed. What did'ft thou do,
When life and sense return'd?

, ' ABDA LLA.H. ',: ';

To sacrifice them to.my just revenge. - -
But whether they ah'd heard my heav4 fall, '
Or that my detth-like ifwoon had lasted long,
I know not, but I never saw. them morel;o '.
I fearch'd till morning; then away I went,
Refolv'd to scorn the' frumpets a.id forget her.
But I have not been able to forget
Nor to despise her'; tho' I hate her m9re

What regions barbarous haft thou explor'd,
What strange vicissitudes of life endur'd
In aclioi and repose. .- ..

AB2DALLA H. .: .

Extremes *of both
I courted to relieve my'tortur'd minrd

G 2 But

But the tormenter still my steps attends;
Behind me mounts, when thro' the ranks of war
I drive my fiery. steed; and when I seek
The hermit's cell, the fiend pursues me there.
Time, which they fay the wounds of passion cures
In other hearts, inflames and festers mine.
There's but one remedy.

VELASCO.

Would I could name one!

ABDALLAH.

Her life. The unction for the serpent's bite
Is the fell serpent's blood. I'll have her life.
Th' adulteress with infamy shall die,
By public justice doom'd. With this intent
Difguis'd I come. If in my proper shape
I had appear'd, alarm'd she would have fled,
And baffled my revenge.

VELASCO.

My Lord, permit me

One thing to mention, which these eyes beheld,
AItho' it squares not just with thy opinion.

ABDALLAH.
Opinion!

VELASCO.

Good my Lord! with patience hear.

When first I was to this employment nam'd,
Which since I have so happily difcharg'd,
The Princess sent and call'd me to her presence.

S The

The treaty with the Moor engrofs'd her thoughts.
That fad and pensive air she always wears
Was fettled to a thicker gloom of grief.' .
Her voice was low and languid. Few her words,'
And the short periods ended with a sigh . . .
But when - gav'e:ier.hopes of thy return,;
A suddeh gleam of joy fpread.o'er'her face,
Like morning.breaking in. a cloudy sky.
With earneft':voice, .still rising as she spoke,
She urg'd dispatch, exhorted me to zeal.
And perseverance. Never to desist
Till I had found thee: For her fate, she said,
The fate of Spain, depended on Alonzo.
Her passion then burst in a flood of tears
That choak'd her utterance.

A-B D ALL AH.

And thou didft believe

That ev'ry word she spoke was mort sincere.
How to interpret her let me initru& thee.
Whate'er flie utters with unufial warmth,
As the effusion' geniine-of her heart,
Receive and construe in another sense
Reverse and opposite; for tliat's'the truth.'
The words she spoke, her sighs, the tears me sied,
Were all from apprehension of my coming,
Not as they feem'd, for fear I should not come.

VELASCO.
'Tis dreadful that.

A-BDALLAH. ' -

'Tis horrible, 'tis monftrots !

When I for her had wav'd my right to reign,
The right undoubted of the Gothic' line,
And ftoop'd, enamour'd, to that base decree
From Spain, -which banith'd the true.heir of Spaina
That ihe fcould pitch on me to be her fool,
And pour such infinite contempt upon me. -
But four days married ! Fond, to:madnefs fond !
And on the very.eve, of my departure ! ''
She would not for a single day refrain,
But iffi'd to prbfittiution !

VELASCO.

I have heard

Stories and tales enough of female falihood,
Some that were triue, and others that were feign'd,
By spiteful wits-maliciouly devis'd.-
But this surpasses all. -

ABDALLAH.

All wicked women

Compar'd with her are faints. She is a foil
To set them off, and make their foulness fair.
In her incontinence Ihe.tands unrivall'd,
Burning in fires peculiar to herself,
Phcenix in lewdness.-

VELASCO.

May I ask my Lord
How he intends ?-But fee, the King draws near.

ADDALLAH.
He's much impair'd.

VELASCO.

When fore afflidiion comes

In the decline of life ! 'tis like a storm
Which in the rear of autumn shakes the tree
That frost had touch'd before; and ffrips it bare
Of all its leaves.

(Enter the KIN G with attendants.)
(As he advances, speaks to V E L A S C 0.)

KING.

We thank thy care, Velafco !

To ABDALLAH.

Illustrious Prince ! whom love of glory brings
From regions so remote, to fight for Spain,
Accept the thanks a grateful nation pays
To her defender.

ABDALLAH.

Monarch of Afturia!

The nations of the East have heard thy praise.
Ilad not the hand of Time unftlrung thine arm,
Spain never would have fought for foreign aid
To quell her foes.

KING.
'Tis better far for Spain

That I am old: For in my warlike days,
When in the prime of flow'ring youth I fought,
I equall'd not thy friend. Above his own,

Above

Above the strength of ev'ry mortal arm
Alonzo thine exalts.

ABDALLAH.

Three times we fought

With equal fortune on the Wolga's banks;
He for the Monguls, I against them stood.
But at our last encounter, on my helm
His faithless blade broke short, and in his hand
The useless hilt remain'd. My sword I dropt,
And in my arms the valiant chief embrac'd.
Our friendihip thus commenc'd, and since that time
AWe have been brothers sworn, and leagu'd in arms.
Alonzo, fighting in my cause, receiv'd
That wound which now detains him from the field.
Urg'd by affection, and by honor bound,
For him I come against the foes of Spain.
But of myself more than enough is said;
'Tis time to a&. The Moorish knight, I hear,
Is in the lifts already.

KING.

Prince of Persia!
The terms to thee are known.

ABDALLAH.

The first of men

W-lYth pride such honors might from Spain receive;
But never can there honors grace Abdallah.
Long since my heart and hand were giv'n away;
And tho' the custom of the East permits
Unnumber'd consorts, me my faith restrains.

But

But if victorious in the iRrife of death,
I have an earners and a just request
To thee, 0 King! which, at a proper time,
I shall be bold to make.

KING.

Whate'er it is,

i pledge my honor and my faith, to grant it.
Enter SEBASTIAN and ALBERTO.

(ALBERTO goes on to the KING.)

KING.

Advance, Alberto ! to the Prince himself,
Deliver thou thy meflage and the present.

ALBERTO.

Great Sir ! the Princess Ormifinda greets
The gen'rous champion of her country's cause,
Wishes that victory may fit to day,
And ev'ry day of battle, on his sword.
This costly bracelet from her arm she fends
To prince Abdallah, to Alonzo's friend.

ABDAL LAH.

(Looking ftedfaftly on A LB E R TO.)

The Princess is molt bountiful, as thou,
Who haft the honor to attend her, know'ft.
Her gracious present humbly I accept,
And thank her for her goodness to Alonzo,
Who will be proud to be by her remember'd.
The combat ended, I propose to'pay
My homage to her beauty. At this. time

H My

My mind is in the lifs.-The Moorish knight
Will think me tardy. (To the KING.)

KING.
Let our trumpets found

A sprightly charge. The warrior's heart beats time
To that brave music. Onward from this place
A path dire& to thy pavilion leads.

(If'e K I N G turns and gives orders).

ABDALLAH (to VELASCO.)

Another minion! View him well, Velafco.
How insolent! See what a crest he rears,
Elated with her favour. 0! vile woman!
Insatiate and inconifant.

VELASCO.

Ah! my Lord!

Truce with such thoughts ! Sure this is not a time !
The combat claims a cool and present mind.

ABDALLAH.
Fear not the combat.

VELASCO.

Thou art waited for;
The King himself intends with thee to walk.

[Exeunt: Abdallah looking back at Alberto.]

(Manent ALBERTO, SEBASTIAN.)

ALBERTO.

That Prince of Persia is compos'd of pride;
He did not deign to look upon the present,

3 But

But ftretch'd his sun-burnt hand straight out before

him,

Like a blind man, and would have stood so still,
Had I not made his fingers feel the pearls.
And all the while he ftar'd me in the face,
As if he meant t'opprefs me with his eye,
And fright me with his fierce and uncouth looks.
I blufh'd at firt, but anger came at last,
And bore me up.

SEBASTIAN.

Those princes of the Eaftr

Us'd to the servile manners of their country,
Where ev'ry prostrate slave adores his lord,
Withotit intention shock the sons of Europe.

ALBERTO.

O ! how unlike to him the King of Spain,
And that most gentle Princess, Ormifinda!
Her look, her voice, benign and mild, dispel
The awe her rank inspires, and reassure
The modest mind. Would'st thou believe, Sebastian,
She talk'd to me, I cannot tell how long,
Before thou cam'ft, and queftion'd me minutely
How I had liv'd, how past my youthful days?
I fear I was too copious in my answers.
What signifies my rural life to her ?
And yet she feem'd to liften with delight,
As if she had an int'reft in my fate
And once or twice when I of danger spoke,

H 2 From

From which I hardly had efcap'd with life,
Methought I law her tremble. Much the blam'd
My rashness; yet she prais'd my courage too.
With all her tenderness of heart, I fee /
That the admires true valour.

SEBASTIAN.

So she does.

The bravest knight that e'er was clad in freel,
Alonzo, was the lover of her youth:
And since he left this land the ne'er rejoic'd.
But of these matters I will tell thee more
At a convenient season. Let us follow,
And join the train before they reach the lifts.

ALBERTO.

I would not lose one moment of this fight
For half the lands of Spain. Tho' I abhor
The Persian, yet I pray devoutly for him.

[Exeunt.]

# ACT IV.

A C T IV.
.SCENE I.

The City.
Enter ORMIISINDA and TERESA,

ORMISINDA.
1T H I S city looks as if a pestilence

-Had swept the whole inhabitants away.

The solitary streets, the empty squares,
Appall me more than the deierted palace.
Let us go back again.

TERESA.

'Tis time we should,

You trembled at the howling of a dog,
That broke the silence and increas'd the horror.
If we stay here we shall be fancy. struck,
Mistake some statue for a pale-fac'd ghost,
And think it beckons with its marble arm.

ORMISINDA.

Why should this desolation frighten me ?
Why should I fear to fee a grave-clad ghof',
Who may so soon be number'd with the dead,
And be myfelfa ghost ? What noise is that?
Did'ft thou not hear, Teresa ?

TERESA.

Yes, I did.
I heard an uncouth found.

ORMISINDA.

Uncouth indeed
An universal groan ! Hark ! there again.

TERESA.

'Tis not the fame. This has another tone,
A shout of triumph, and a burfR of joy.

ORMISINDA.

The combat's over, and my Hte's determin'd.
Now death or life!

[the trum7npets found.]

TERESA.

Long may the Princess live!

And every hour be fortunate as this!
The Spanilh trumpets found, the sign I know.
Thy champion has prevail'd.

ORMIS IND A.

O gracious Heav'n!
The lifts are near, and we {hall quickly learn,

TERESA.

Look yonder, flying swifter than the wind,
A horseman comes; now at the gate he lights,
And haftes across the square. It is Sebastian.
His look, his gesture, speak his tidings good.

[Enter SEBASTIAN.)

SEBASTIAN.

Joy to the Princess ! Vitory and peace !
The Moor is lain by brave Abdallah's hand.

ORMISIND A.

Blest be thy tongue, Sebastian ! Thou ihalt find
Some better recompence than barren thanks
For these glad tidings. But the gen'rous Prince
Who fought for Spain-

SEBASTIAN.

Safe and without a wound,

Fresh for another foe, Abdallah itands.
Short was the combat: Soon the boaster fell,
Who durst defy the Christian world to arms.

ORMISINDA.

The God of battles, whom Abdallah serves,
Has overthrown the infidel, whose trust
Was in his own right arm.

SEB A ST IA N.

IfI ifhould live

Ten thousand years, I never could forget
The solemn prelude and the fierce encounter.
Thou know'ft the place appointed for the combat,
An amphitheatre by nature form'd.

ORMISINDA.
I know it well.

SEBASTIAN.
The hills, of various slope
And shape, which circle round the spacious plain,

Were

Were cover'd with a fiultitude inimenfe
Of either sex, of every age and rank,
Christian and Moor; whose faces and attire
Strangely diversified the living scene.
Within the lifts a gallery was rais'd
In which thy father and the Moorish prince
Sate with their peers, the judges of the field.
To them the knights with flow and Rately pace
Approach'd; and bound by sacred oaths declar'd
That they no charm nor incantation us'd,
But trusted in their valour and their arms.
With low obeisance then they both fell back;
And first the Moor (for he the challenge gave)
March'd to the middle of the lifted field;
There seiz'd his ponderous mace, beneath whose

weight,

The brawny bearer bow'd; and round his head,
Like a light foil, heflouriih'd it in air.
On him with diff'rent thoughts the nations gazed.
But suddenly a flah of light and flame
Struck ev'ry eye from brave Abdallah's shield,
Cover'd till then. 'Twas made of polish'd steel,
Which shone like adamant; and to a point
Rose in the centre, slanting on each fide.
This Ihield the Persian Prince advancing bore
On his left arm outltretch'd, and in his right,.
Thrown back a little, gleam'd a pointed wiord.
EreI and high the bold Mirmallon itood,
And sternly ey'd his near-approaching foe.
Then forward sprung, and on the flaming shield -
Difcharg'd a mighty blow, enough to crufl

A wall,

A wall, or split a rock. The Spaniards gave
A general groan.

ORMISINDA.

That was the dreadful found
We heard, Teresa.

SEBASTIAN.
Glancing from the fnield,

Aside the mace descended. Then enrag'd,
Once more the Moor his thund'ring weapbn rear'd.
In ftept tie Prince, and raising high his shield,
Midway he niet the blow; and with the strength
And vigour of his arm, obliquely down'
The pond'rous mace he drove. Then quick as

thought,

His better hand and foot at once advancing,
Plung'd in Mirmallon's throat his thirsty blade.
The giant ftagger'd for a little space;
Then falling, sook the earth. The Christians rais'd
A Ihout that rent the air. Away I came,
Happy to be the bearer of such tidings.

['Trumpet.

ORMISINDA.

Behold, they come in triumph from the field.
O! glorious man! And yet forgive me, Heav'n,
I grudge the conquest to Alonzo's friend,
And wish Alonzo in Abdallah's place.

Enter the KING, ABDALLAH, VELASCO,

ALBERTO, &C.

ABDALLAH. [To Yela/fc.]
See where she stands. 0 Heavens!

I

VELASCO.

My Lord Alonzo,
Compose thy thoughts.

ABDALLAH.
Behold her how Ihe looks,

As if lhe knew no ill. That harden'd heart
Against remorse and fear and shame is arm'd;
But I shall wring it now.

KING.
Daughter, draw near!

This godlike Prince all recompence disclaims,
Save thanks from Spain. The pleating talk be thine
To greet the saviour of thy native land,
And speak our gratitude.

ORMISINDA.

No words can speak

The gratitude I feel. Believe it great
As my deliverance, vast as my distress!
Like fad Andromeda, chain'd to the rock
I flood a living prey, when this brave Prince,
Came like another Perseus from the sky,
And fav'd me from destruction. I forget,
Wrapt in myself, the charge my father gave
To thank the saviour of my native land;
Another voice shall give thee thanks for Spain,
Alonzo's voice flall thank thee for his country,
His friends, his people-fav'd.

ABDALLAH.

Ah ! If I hear (Aside.)
This syren longer, she will charm my rage;

But

But I remember where I heard her last.
Princess of Spain! I merit not thy praise;
Sent by Alonzo to this land I came:
WThat has been done, for Him I have perform'd.
Now of his promise I remind the King
To grant me one request.

KING.
Speak! It is granted.

ORMISINDA.

If I conjeture right, even that request
Will prove one favour more on Spain conferr'd.

ABDALLAH.
Perhaps it may

KING.

Proceed, illuflrious Prince!
And make me happy to fulfil thy wilh.

ABDALLAH.

Not for myself I speak, but for my friend;
And in his name, whose person I sustain,
I ask for justice on a great offender.

KING.

Thou (halt have ample and immediate justice.
Nor favour nor affinity shall Ikreen
The guilty person. Prince, why art thou troubled?
Thou fhak'ft from head to foot. Thy quiv'ring lip
Is pale with passion. On thy forehead stand
Big drops. Almighty God ! What dreadful birth
Do there strong pangs portend?

I2

ABDALLAH.

The guilty person,

Whom with a capital offence I charge,
Stands by thy fide.

KING.

My daughter!
ABDALLAH.

Yes! thy daughter!

'Tis her I mean, the Princess Ormiinda.
Here in the pretence of the Peers of Spain,
I charge her with a crime, whole doom the laws
Of Spain have wrote in blood: Adultery.
I read astonishment in ev'ry face!
'Who would fufpea that one so highly born,
With ev'ry outward mark of virtue grac'd,
Had giv'n her honour to a worthless wretch,
And driv'n a noble husband to despair!

KING.

Am I awake! Is this the light of day ?
Art thou, O ! Prince, with sudden frenzy seiz'd ?
Oris the madness mine ? Renown'd Abdallah !
What answer can be made to such a charge ?
This strange demand ofjuftice on my daughter,
For an offence that she could not commit?
My daughter ne'er was married.

ABDALLAH.

Ask her that?
Hea;r if fe will deny lle has a husband ?

KING.
Mry child, thou art amaz'd !

ORMISINDA.

No, not so much

As thou wilt be, my father, when thou hear'st
Thy daughter's tongue confess she has a husband.

K IN G.

Haft thou a husband ! God of heav'n and earth !
Since thou haft thus dissembled with thy father,
Perhaps thou haft deceiv'd thy husband too.
Who is thy husband ? Speak!

ORMISINDA.

The Prince Alonzo.

KING.

And haft thou been so long in secret wedded?
'Tis eighteen years since he departed hence.

ORMISINDA.

O ! I have reason to remember that.
There is no calendar so just and true
As the fad mem'ry of a wife forsaken.
The years, the months, the weeks, the very days,
Are reckon'd, regifter'd, recorded there I
And of that period I could cite such times,
So dolorous, distressful, melancholy,
That the bare mention of them would excite
Amazement how I live to tell the tale.
But I forget the present in the past.
No wonder, for this moment is the first
That opes the sluices of a heart o'ercharg'd,

And

And buriing with a flood of grief conceal'd,
But I muf turn me to another theme.
The earnef eyes of all are bent on me,
Watching my looks, and prying to discern
Symptoms of innocence or signs of guilt.
Hear then the frank confession of my foul:
I have tranfgrefs'd.

KING.

Stain of a noble race !
Dof thou avow thy crime ?

ORMISINDA.

Mistake me not,

I have tranfgrefs'd my duty to my father:
Without his knowledge, and against his will,
Mov'd by a tender lover's parting tears,
I join'd myself in wedlock to Alonzo.
My King, my father, pardon the offence,
Which against thee I own I have committed:
But may I ne'er of God or man be pardon'd,
Nor friend nor father ever pity me,
If I have'fwerv'd one flep from virtue's path,
Or broke the fmnallef parcel of that vow
Which binds a faithful wife ! 0 ! Prince of Persia
Thou art the befl of friends and benefactors;
Thou conm'2 to end my molft difrating woes,
And to dispel th' impenetrable cloud
That darken'd all my days. Now I mhall know
Why I have been abandon'd and forsaken,
Why I have been detested and defpis'd,

As

As never woman was. Proceed, my Lord.
And whilst thou keenly dost assail my life,
And, dearer far, my honor and my fame,
Secure in innocence, I'll calmly hear.
From thee, I hope, the end of all my cares.

ABDALLAH.

Even thus Alonzo told me she would speak,
And thus proclaim her innocence.

ORMISIND A.

Did He ?

O ! would to Heav'n Alonzo heard me now,
Fearless defend his honor and my own!
My voice, which once was music to his ear,
Like David's harp which footh'd the gloomy kings
Would charm his malady, would drive away
The evil spirit, and call back again
The better genius of his early days.
O ! thou that wert so good, so great ! admir'd
Of all mankind ! my lov'd, my loft Alonzo !
For thee, in this humiliating hour,'
More than myself I mourn.

ABD ALLAH. (Half aside.)

Eternal. Power

To whom the secrets of all hearts are known!
Hear, hear this woman, and between us judge !
iTis not my business to contend with words,
These are the conquering arms of womankind.
A nobler course of trial lies before me:
In a wrong'd husband's name I charge this lady
With infidelity; and crave the doom

5 Of

Of law upon her head. If any knights
Spaniard or stranger, dares assert her cause,
Let him fland forth, and take my gauntlet up;
Which on the ground I throw, my gage to prove
That the is false to honor and Alonzo.

OR MISIND A.

Before the gage of death is lifted up,
Hear me one moment. By Alonzo sent,
Thou com'ft inftruted in Alonzo's wrongs;
Let me conjure thee then, by all that's dear,
By all that's sacred to the great and brave,
Thy mother's memory, thy consort's fame,
Not on a gen'ral charge, obscure and vague,
To which there is no answer but denial,
To found the claim of combat: Single out
What circumstance thou wilt of special note,
Of such a kind as may be tried and known
For true or false. Tell us at least his name
With whom Alonzo's wife her honor ftain'd,
And let us be confronted.

[12ngig ALBERTO fieps fcrh.
ALBERTO.

Heaven forbid

That thou ihould'ft be confronted with a villain.
Princess of Spain! Be sure tome wretch there is,
Some renegado, false to God and man,
Suborn'd, and ready with a lying tongue,
To secr.d this brave Prince who wrongs thy fame,
And wounds thy modest ear. Too much by far
Already thou haft heard. Pretended Prince!

For

For there is nothing royal in thy foul !
Thou base defamer of a lady's name!
I take thy gauntlet up, and hold it high .
Ih scorn,. and fierce defiance, to thy face,
My gage to prove thy accusation false,
And thee, the author of a tale invented
To rob a noble&lady of her fame.

ORMISINDA.
Where am I now ? What shall I do, Teresa?

.[Afde.

TERE SA.-
The God of Heav'n diret thee !

ABDALLAH.

Boy! To thee

I answer nothing. I fufpet the cause
Of thy presumption, and could with that Spain
Had giv'n a worthier victim to my sword.

[Walks aside,

ORMISINDA..

0 ! valiant youth! much am I bound to thee:
But I have reasons that import the state,
Which shall, whatever is my fate, be known,
And own'd hereafter to be great and weighty,
Why I decline th' assistance of thy sword.
If this appeal to combat is the law,
And I can find no champion but Alberto,
Without the chance of combat let me fall,
For I will not accept---

K

ALBERTO.

Recall these words,

Too gen'rous Princes ! I can read thy th6ughts,
Thou think'ft my youth unequal to the foe;
Thou ftar'ft the weakness of Alberto's arm.
My strength exceeds the promise of my years.
Oft have I bent the bow, and drawn the sword,
Nor fly my shafts, nor falls my sword in vain.
This day against a troop alone I fought;
But never did I fight in such a cause,
Nor was I e'er so certain to prevail.
A fire divine invades my zealous breat :
I feel the force of legions in mine arm.
Thy innocence has made thy champion itrong !
The God of battles is our righteous judge;
And let the cause be tried.
(A warrior a;med, with his helmet on, steps fortb.)

WARRIOR.

But not by thee!

Thy father's voice forbids, too daring youth!
Stand back, and let thy master in the art
Of war, now claim the combat for his own.
My liege! ,

KING.

That voice I know: Thy figure too

Resembles much a chief, lamented long
As slain in battle.

WARRIOR.

I am he, Coftollo.

'Tis true, 0! king ! that on the field I fell,
Fighting f6r Spain. How I was fav'd from death,
And where, for many years I have remain'd,
This is no time to tell. This hour demands
A soldier's speech, brief prologue to his deeds.
,On me, proud Persian! turn thy gloomy eyes,
Hear me, and let thy ready sword reply.
With hell-born malice, level'd ather life,
Thou haft defam'd a Princess, honour'd, lov'd,
By all, who virtue or fair honour love.
The fell Hyena, native of thy land,
Has not a voice or heart more false than thine,
Thou counterfeit of truth! whom I defy
To mortal combat, and the proof of arms.
Thy full-blown fame, thy unexhaufted strength,
Deceitful confidence, I laugh to scorn;
The conquering cause is mine.

ALBERTO.

My lord, the King !

And ye his counsellors for wisdom fam'd!
You will not sure permit this good old man,
By fond affection for his son impell'd,
To meet so stern a foe. His hoary head,
His wither'd veins, are symptoms of decay.
Lean not upon a reed which time hath bruis'd,
Nor trust the life and honour of the Princess
To the weak arm of age.

K2

ABDALLAH.

I'll fight you both,

Father and son at once. Together come,
Tongue-valiant men ! and try Abdallah's arm.
I'll have it so; for both of you have dar'd,
Ignoble as you are, to match yourselves
Against a Prince who moves not in your sphere,
And utter words for which such blood as yours
Is poor atonement.

COSTOLLO.

Ev'ry word thou fpeak'ft

Is insolent and false. Son of a slave!
For eastern monarchs buy with gold their brides,
The blood by thee defpis'd, flows from a source
Purer than thine and nobler.

ALBERTO.

Nay, my father!

That's said too far. Fierce and disdainful Prince,
Vain is the offer which thy paflion makes.
Perhaps the conqueror of the Moor may find
One Spaniard is enough.

COSTOLLO.

A father's right

Unmov'd I claim, and with determin'd voice
Forbid the combat.

KING.

Hence let us retire

To the pavilion. There our peers. hall judge
Of your pretensions.

[Exeunt King and Spaniards.

ABDALLAH.
Come with me, Velafco.

[Exeunt Abdallah and Velafco.
(Manent ORMISINDA and TERESA.)

ORMISINDA.

My thoughts are of my son. Mine own estate
Is defp'rate. The husband whom I lov'd,
On whom I doated, and from whom I fuffer'd,
What never woman with such patience bore,
Conspires against my honour and my life.
Long cherifh'd hope, farewel!

TERESA.

To guard thy son

Defend thyself; and, to prevent the combat,
In thy demand pertift. Call the accuser
To circumstance of proof. That is the thread
To lead us thro' this labyrinth perplex'd.
Nor has the Persian thy demand refus'd.

-ORMISINDA.

He had not time to speak. Alberto's voice
Broke in like thunder/in his mother's cause.
Amidfl the anguish of my tortur'd heart,
My foul exults, Teresa ! in my son !

~2 ~ When

When in the pride of valour forth he came,
And for my fake defied the bold Abdallah,
His look (he feem'd a cherub in my eyes !)
His voice (at every word my bosom yearn'd !)
Transported me'fo much, that I forgot
His slate and mine, and had well nigh sprung forth
To clasp my blooming hero in my arms.

TERESA.

No wonder that his mother's foul was mov'd:
His brave demeanor the fpeaators charm'd.
Valour, which sheds a glory round the head
Of age and ruggedness; how bright its beams
When in the lovely front of youth they shine!

OR MISIND A.

I've heard of strange and perilous essays
To try the pureness of suspected virtue.
I'll undergo whate'er can be devis'd.
By ordeal trial let my faith be prov'd.
Blindfold, barefooted, on the fmoaking foil,
With red hot plough-thares spread, I'll walk my way;
Plunge in the boiling oil my naked arm,
But will not risk my young Alonzo's life.
The Moorilh host hangs o'er our heads no more.
The heir of Spain (hall for himself be known,
Alonzo's son.

TERESA.

He will not be allow'd

Alonzo's son, nor yet the heir of Spain,
Whilst slander's breath sullies his mother's fame.

ORMISINDA.

Now thou haft touch'd a firing, to whose deep found
A mother's heart replies. My son! my son!
I weigh ihy virtues down, hang on thy life,
Attaint thy blood, thy birth, thy right to reign !
The birds of prey that dwell among the rocks,
The savage beafrs that thro' the deserts roam,
The monflers of the deep, their offspring love,
And to preserve their lives devote their own.
Athwart the gloom, I fee a flash of light,
That opens the horizon. I descry
A hand that points a high and lofty path
Which I will boldly tread. Now to my father.
Upon my knees his aid I'll firfl implore.

[Exeunt.

# ACT V.

A CT V.

SCENE I.
ABDALLAH lnd VELASCO.

VELASCO.
.EFORE this day fie ne'er beheld the boy.

Far from this place in Catalonia bred,

He came to fee the famous combat fought.
'Twas he, my Lord, who flew the Moorish chief,
And in his own defence such wonders wrought.
That acion to the Princess made him known,
The reft in honour of his valour follow'd.

ABDALLAH.
How dost thou know ?

VELASCO.

With admiration struck,

When he flood forth and brav'd a foe, like thee,
Of divers persons curious I enquir'd,
Who, and from whence he was.

ABDALLAH.

Pity it were

To hurt the stripling. 'Tis a noble boy.
I love the outbreak of his Spanish fire
Against the Moors.

VELASCO.

Ay, and against Abdallah,

Wthom antient fame and recent glory rais'd,
Above all mortal men. Spare this young plant,
Who makes so fair a fioor.

ABDALLAH.

How can I spare him ?

Should their election fend him to my sword,
How, good Velafco ?

VELASCO.

When the peers return,

The King, the Princess, with their champion chofcn,
Then to the wond'ring audience, in the face
Of her that's guilty, let my Lord relate
The trurh-mark'd itory he to me has told.
Dete&ed thus, confounded and furpris'd,
Pierc'd with a thousand eyes, that gaze upon her,
And dart conviction; can she still deny,
And by denial, make her guilt ambiguous ?
But if her sex's genius is so ifrong,
That she the port of innocence maintains,
And, from the fulness and excess of vice,
Derives a boldness, that may look like virtue,
Then let the sword decide.

ABDALLAH.

What you propose

Is worth the trial. I am loth to spill
The young Alberto's or Coftollo's blood:

L . For

For they deserve no harm. Ev'n you, my friend,
Before my hand unclafp'd the book of shame?
Her champion would have been.

VELASCO.

Against the world.

ABDALL AH.

I will adopt the counsel of Velafco,
And probe more deeply still her fefter'd mind.
I fee 'tis better that she ihould confess
Her guilt, than with her vanquifh'd champion fall,
By doom of law, protesting to the last
Her innocence.

VELASCO.

Better a thousand times.

Her dying voice would shake the hearts of men,
And echo thro' the world.

ABDALLAH.

Behold the King,

And young Alberto marching by his fide
As if he trod on air.

VELASCO.

See, Ormifinda
WVith folded hands implores her lift'ning fire.

Enter the King, Ormifinda, Teresa, Alberto,

Coftollo, &c.

KING.

The peers of Spain havejudg'd. Stand forth, Alberto.
Behold the champion of my daughter's fame,

ALBERTO.

Before the trumpet's voice uniheaths the sword
Which one of us shall never sheath again$
Permit me, Prince of Persia, to intreat
A moment's audience. Not from fear I fpeaki
The cause I fight for, and the mind I bear,
Exalt me far above the thoughts of danger;
But from .a corifcious sense of what is due
To theej renown'd Abdallah. In the hear
Of our contention, if my tongue has utter'd
One word offensive to thy noble ear,
Which might have been omitted, and the tone
Of firm defiance equally preferv'd;
For that I ask forgiveness.

ABDALLAH.

Less I mark'd

The manner than the matter of thy speech:
If thou dost need forgiveness, freely take it;

KIN G.

'Twas generously ask'd, and niobly granted i
Such courtesy with valour ever dwells.
Let me too crave for a fev words thine ear.
Throughout the trying bus'n-efs of this days
Thou art my witness, that my mind upright
Has never been by pow'rful nature bent,
Nor fway'd to favour and opinion form'd,
By long habitual and accuftom'd love:
But I with equal hand the balance held
Between thee and my child,

LM

Thou haft indeecl.
It is but justice that I fficud declare it.

Then to thy candour let me now appeal,
And beg of thee to grant me one reque-it,
'Which I do not, but might perliaps, coimmnaw.

ABDALLAH.
What is it?

KING.

I have fearch'd my hapless child,

Ev'n to the pith and marrow of her foul,
Have touch'd herto the quick. She never {frinks,
Nor wavers in the least. Perihaps, my-Lord !
Some soed officious, or some wr.etch that's worse,
(If there is ought comes between man and wife
That's more pernicious than a medling fool) . :'
Some false designing friend has wrong'd her fame,
And pour'd his poison in Alonzo's ear.
If thou wilt give some fccpe to her defence,
And bring the charge from darkneas into lighty
Then fie fiall forthwith anf.v-er on the spot
Where now. DIe Rands before us.

Guilty of all. Before-hand I renounce
The right of combat, ,and fubnit to die.

Thy with is fatal, but it mhall be granted,
This instant too.

ORMISINDA..
Blessings upon thy head !

Ten thoufand.blefings ! 0! thou dost not know-
How happy thou haft made.me. On my breast

And now I breathe again.

My heart knocks at my fide, as if 'twould burf .
Itself a passage outwards. Yet a while,
Poor fuff'ring heart, and thou-filalt beat no more,.
Shortly for what I am I ihall be known,
Then let my doom be fqutar'd to my-defeht.
Without indulgence.

-KING.

I can truft.thee, now:

Thine eye secure beams. innocence and-honour.
Thou art my daughter still.

ALBERT O.

I fear, 0 King

Some pra&cice vile, some infamous imposture,
Supported by false witness. Still I with
The fair decifiori of the honest sword.
'Enter ABDALL4H in a Spanih Dress as ALONZO.

KING.

God of my foul! What mockery is this ?
Urlefs my eyes deceive miie, 'tis Alorizo;

ORMISINDA.
My husband! Ah! [Runs to embrace him, be

repulses her.]

ALONZO.

Away, thy htufband's shame,
Shame to thy sex, reproach of womankind

ORMISINDA.
0! fiield me, Heav'n! Abdallah was Alonzo,

ALONZO;
To Heav'n appeal not;

ORMISINDA.

I appeal to Heav'ni
Jurtice on earth will come too late for me.

KING. [To Alonzo.]
Haft thou no other witness than thyself?

ALONZO.
I have no other, and none else require,

KING.

Unfeeling man, to trifle with our sorrows,
And like a pageant play a mimic scene:
This is thy hatred of Pelagio's house,
Thy paflion to confound a rival race,
Would I were young again!

ALBE R TO. . [To Alonzo.]

Defend thyself.
I can no longer hold me from thy breast.

PELAGIO.
Sound, trumpet, found! and Heav'n defend the

right

A L O N Z O. [Drauwiqg his Seord.]
His blood be on your heads.

[Ormifinda throws herself between their Swords.]

ORMISINDA:
Hold ! Strike thro' me !

You know not what you do, unhappy both!
This combat must not, nor it thall not be.
The Sun in Heav'n would backward turn his course,
And flrink from such a fpeaacle as this,
More horrid than the banquet of Thyestes.
You have no quarrel. I'll remove the cause.
A Rpman matron, to redeem her fame,
Before her husband's and her father's eyes
Plung'd in her breast the steel.

[Stabs heifelf, andfalls.]

KING.
O! Defp'rate deed!
What fury prg'd thy hand ?

OR MISIN-DA.

Conderfh me not,

There was no other way to fave-but that
Must not as yet be told. My hulband! hear
My dying voice! my latest words believe,
Whose truth my blood hath seal'd: I'm innocent,
As I for mercy hope at that tribunal-
Where I shall soon appear, I never wrong'd thee.
When that is manifefr, remember me
As love like mine deferv'd, and to this youth,
Who is-

ALONZO.

Who is this youth! All-feeing God !

A secret horror comes upon my foul,
Who is this youth !

ORMISINDA.

He is thy son.
ALONZO.

My son ]

OR MISIND A.

SWhom thy forsaken wife in sorrow bore,
And gave in secret to Coftollo's care.

ALBERTO.
Art thou my mother! Dost thou die for me ?

OR MISIND A.

I die with pleasure to be just to thee.
0 if that Power which did inspire my foul
To ruth between your swords, would let me live,

~I To

To prove my innocence. Alonzo ipeak !
Whilt I have breath to answer.

ALONZO.

Tho' difarm'd

And foften'd5 even if guilty to forgive thee, -
Thy solemn call I initanfly obey.
.That night appointed for our last farewel,
That fatal night for ever curst- thou know'ft
What happen'd then.

ORMISINDA,
I know thou didft not come,
Forlorn thou lefted'ft me.

ALONZO.

Thou waft not forlorn..
In the dark wood with thee there was a youthl -

ORMI S IND A, (After apau/e.)
0 heaven and earth, a youth! It was Teresa;

ALONZO.
Teresa!

TERESA.
Yes, that memorable night,
My brother's sword and helmet plum'd I wore.

ALONZO.
Great God ! the snares of hell .have caught my foul,

TERESA.

The night before, the Princess, as she went,
Was fright'ned in the wood, and I assumed
That warlike form, to seem-

M

A-LONZO.

'No matter why ?
I saw thee then, and thought thee what thou feem'dft.

-: . "KING.

She's innocent; like gold trr)d in the fire,
Her honour flines: Would I had died for thee 1

[To ORMISINDA;

' ORMISINDA.
Why didft thou never till this moment speak ?

[ho ALorszo.
[To ALONZO.

AL ONZO.

Because I'm born and deftin'd to perdition.
Had I a voice like _Etna when it roars;
For in my breast is pent as hot a fire:
I'd speak in fltmes.

ORMISINDA.

My Lord!
ALONZO.

Do not forgive me.

Do not oppress me with such tender looks:
I will not be forgiven.

[ORMISINDA raniJfg herself and ftretchilg

out her arms.
ORMISINDA.

Come to my arms

And let me sooth thine anguilh. Had I been
What I to thee appear'd, thy rage wasjuft.
A Spaniard's temper, and a Princess pride,

A Lover's

A Lover's pafion, and a Husband's honour,
Prompted no less.

ALONZO.

Hear, men and angels hear.
Let me fall down and worlhip.

[Throws hinmfelf into her arms.

Oh I loved thee 1
I lov'd thee all the while, to madness loved.

ORMISINDA.

My huiband! dear as ever to my heart!
In my last moments dear!

ALONZO.

My heart is torn.

My head, my brain ! How blest I might have been!
With such a wife, with such a son!

ORMISINDA.

To him

Pay all the debt of love thou ow'ft to me:
Embrace thy son before mine eyes are clos'd:
Let me behold him in his father's arms.

ALONZO.
Thou brave defender of thy mother's fame !

ORMISINDA..
He's gentle too his foul dissolves in grief.

ALONZO.

My falt'ring tongue dares scarcely call thee son.
Canst thou endure the touch of such a father ?

M 2

ALBERTO.

My burrting heart, amidt its grief is proud
Of such a father. Let me clasp thy knees,
And help to reconcile thee to thyself.

[they embraca

ORMISINDA.

This pleasing fight subdues the pains of death,
My son !

ALBERTO.

My mother, Oh!
ORMISINDA.

My dearest husband-

ALONZO.

Whatwould'ftthoufay. Alas ! thine eyegrows dim
Thy voice begins to fail.

'ORMISINDA.

Remember me

When I am dead; remember how I lovd you,
And thou, Alonzo, live to guard thy son,
To fix the Spanilh scepter in-

[Dies looking at her /on.
Alonto remains silent, with bis ees fixed upon

Ormifinda.

ALBERTO.

My father!

Under thy gatherd brows I fee despair:
Have pity on thy ton, who liv'd so long
In total ignorance of what he was:

Who

Who has already seen one parent die,
And for the fad survivor trembles npgw,
My mother's last request !

ALONZO.

I'm mindful of it,

And to her sacred memory will be just.
Hang not on me, my onri! go to the King
And pay thy duty there.

[The King embraces Alberta,
:SING.

My child, my all
I lov'd thee at sirs light.

ALONZO.

'Tis well; 'tis well,

The good old King hath fill some comfort left.
Now is my time. [Draws hisffword.

Oft have I struck with thee,

But never struck a foe with better will
Than now myself. [Stabs himself and falls,

VELASCO, COSTOLLO.

Alas!
(ALBERTO turning.)

ALBERTO.

'Twas this I sear'd.

ALONZO.

There was good cause to fear. I would have liv'd
For thee, if I with honour could have liv'd.

3 - My

My son! thy fathers were renown'd in arms .
The valour of our warlike race is thine:
But guard against the impulse of their blood.
Take warning by my fate.

PELAGIO.

Thou might'ft have liv'd,

Renown'd Alonzo; even I forgave
And pited thee.

ALONZO.

I am more just than thou-

For I did not forgive, nor would I live,
Upon the alms of other men; their pity-
Farewel, my son! 0! Ormifinda, stay
'Till I o'ertake thee. [Dies.

(Tbe King to ALBERTO.)

PELAGIO,

Dwell not on this fight,
Prince of Afturia! leave the scene of sorrow,

.T'HO' lately dead, a Princess, and of Spain,

I am no: Gho, but Fle/h and Blood again!

No time to change this Dress, it is expedient,
Jpafs for BritiJh; and your molI obedient.

How happy, Ladies, for us all--7at we,

Born in this Ij/e, by lMagna Charta free,
Are not like Spanilh JIives, kept under Lock and Key. 3
The Spaniard now,- is not like-him of Yore,
?Who in his whJikier'd face, his Titles bore !
Nor Joy, nor Vengeance made him smile or grin,
Six'd were his features, tho' the Devil within !
He, when once jealous, to wajh out the Stain,
Stalk'd home, Jfabb'd Madam, and falk'd out again,
Thanks to the times, this Dagger-drawing panfion,
Thro' poli/h'd Europe, is quite out of Fajhion.
Signor Th' Italian, quick of fight and hearing,
'Once ever lJ'ning, and for ever leering,
To Cara Spofa, now politely kind,
He, best of Husbands, is both deaf and blind.
Mynheer the Dutchman, with his fiober pace,
Whene'er he finds his Rib has wanted Grace,
He feels no Branches sprouting from his Brain,
But Calculation makes of Loss and Gain;
And when to part with her, occasion's ripe,
Mynheer turns out mine Frcw, and finokes his pipe.
