2The Palace Coulrt.

Enter Paulus and Titus.

Paurl, .~ HI S is no time to firive for vain renown.!

SThe fate of Rome, remember that, my:

brother !

D~epends on thle def~ence of Aquildia.

Clit. Pauilus, I know.
Pauil. But thou dost not: confider,

Th' importance of this wtar. WJe tight: not nowl,
As oft since Freedom fell our father~s fought,
Whien Latian chiefs contended who thould reig
With half the senate lifted on each fide;Fs
Trhe vicaor still was Roman, and rever'd
TIhe gods and temples of immortal Rome.
But o'er you mighty holt, thate girds- our wa-~:!:~~~:
Fierce Maximin commands: whether of ThraM,,j·;:.-
Or wild Dralmatia, to obs~cure his birth,
Himself scarce knows; but: sure Barbarian born.
TThis savage soldier, nurs'd in blood and war,
Whom military frenzy hath set up
T'o trample on mank~ind, abhors a Roman :
Anid marks for deatha the nobl~e and the brave,

A 3 His'

H-is yoke at last, th'indignant senate scorns,
TIhe 'flumb'ring genius of our country w akes,
And roules slothful Italy to arms.
The furious tyrant from the frontier halles,
L~ike: a wild besit g~all'd by the hunter's spear·,
And, breathing vengeance, ruihes upon Rome :
Here first oppos'd, tenfold his fury burns ;
~Here in the pals of f~ate, our father flands,
Defies and flops the monster in his rage,
Tdi Rome's laR legions come to give him~ battle.
Now, when a ·foldier's life is of such moment,
WVhen definiry hangs on a single day,
To fight for glory, l'Tius, were a crime.

9ait. No PauhtsJ, no i it is not fame alone

That 'Titus seeks to purchase from the foe~;
Tho' fud~a crimne the gods and men would pardon.
I know the peril that o'er R~ome impends,
And know the hated cause of all our· ills,
That army only brave againlt their country,
J mean to mitniethem, and their ·giant leader,
Whom nature for a gladiator form'd,
Tro be the sport, and not the lord, of Rome.
The blow once fitruck, our foe must raise the siege,
Or waste his veterans in vain attacks,
And gpive to Gordian~us easy co~nquest.

Paul. Wuere this a frontier city far from Rome,

And you huge hoit compos'd of foes remote,
German or Parthian; I would fay to thee,
Lead on, my brother ! thield to thield we'd go,
And fire yon turret, or together perifhl.
But now, when conquest by delay is gain'd,
Wh'2en Aqjuilda guards the walls of Rome,
Dread of the great event has 10 poffefs'd me,
'That, like the Persian soldier, I could flay
My arm uplif'tedJ, patient to the call.
Ofcautious duty.

'Tit. A'nd renouncing fame ?

Oh ! Paulus!i you have gain~'d long since the prize
That I contend for. Every martial palm
Tihy sword hath won, When I, like thee, am great,
In deqds of arms, hlie Shee I mr y be· wary.

N~ow to my brother i ·lay barte my breast :
This famous flege approaches to its end;
Whatever end the ruling gods ordain,
YTet no diftinguiflh'd a~tion graces me,
i've done my duty. T 7hat I reckon nothing;
The meaneit fodier has not ihrunk from duty ;
Son of ./miius, and thy brother, Paurlus!
I mull do mor e, and by the gods I will i
Here T have found a path that leads to glory ;
Do not oppose me, es fe-we're friends no more.-
Our father comes. Speak not againit~my purpose,
And I shall move the cons~uls noble mind.

Enter AEmilius.

.7Emil. Health to my sons!
Paul. and Tit. Heav'n guard our father's lifet!
./mil. And b~less my children ! ha ! your looks are

keen.

YZour's chiefly, fitrus!i what hath itirr'd· your spirit ?r
HIow points the enemy ?This quiet night,
In preparation palt, portends a florm.

Paul. On that attack which threats the eastern gate

The enemy hath labour'd a~llnight long,
Repairing what the river's rage had rulin'd.

.7Eil. It was a friendly flood. The river god

With all his waters guards his native walls ;
On that firong quarter they can ne'er prevail.
TIhe north J fear, where yon flupendous tow'r
Our works commands.

f-it. It shall not long command,

Let but the consul grant me my desire.

.Anmil. What would my son ?
lit. Their tow'r is weakly guarded.

At break of day, a soldier from yon camp
Fled to my poit hollow and g aunt he was;
His th~rivell'd limbs fearce bore his founding armns
Like him, he said, with toil and fadmine worn,
Were half the tyrant's host. For Mkaximin,
M~ad with delay, and fiercer from repulse~,
Reviles his soldiers, drives them to the trench
With whips and tharp reproach, This day o'ercomey

By firong necefiity, he breathes a-while,
And lends his legions forth, to gather in
W7hatever this exhauffed region yieldcs.
I saw the busy foragers in troops
March, and disperse themselves on ev'ry fide,
L~ike playful children on a fumnmer day,
Secure and carelers; ~for no martial band
Of late hath sallied from our guarded gates.
Thisis the time. Permit me, O my father !
Nlow to attack their ill defended lines,
And fire that mighty tow'r in which they trust,

./Email Well haft thou spoke, my son, thy zeal I love,

Nor mult thy flkill and judgment part~unprais'd,
Be thus att-entive Itill, and t~russ me, 7iturs,
In future sieges, and in other wars,
Swift execution thall thy purpole honour.

'Tit. Ne'er thall I fee another siege like this, ·

Ne'er draw my' Sword in filch a glorious cauie.
Alas ! my lord ! check not my Cpring of thought,
Nor nip the poly bud it yet has borne.

Aimil. Riper occasions will thy valour claim.

Danger comes on ; Typlueus-like it comes,
Whole fabled flature ev'ry hour encreas'd.

'Tt fjdge not of the counsel by the weight

Of himn that gives it. Would to heav'n, my lord !
"That I could now divest; me of~ that youth
Which mars mycredit. Chearfully I'd fep
Far into age, to gain but for a day
The grave authority which years beffow,

Palul, WJhat brings the brave NJumidian Gartha hither ?

Ent'er Gartha.

Gar. Hail to the general!
Abil. Hail, valiant Gartha!

~How has the morning palt where you command ?
SGar·.It has been bury. The prefumrptuous foe
In looie diiorder'd squadrons rang'd the fIelds.
I wvatch'd the time; and sudden as the blast
That rises in the defart, out wve rufh'd
Aind [wept them from tlhe plain. Safet in our speed

We~

We urg'd the chace far as the riing: ground,
And unmolefied view'd the camp below.
TIhis worthy of your notice I obferv'd,
Their wond'rous tower, the work of many a day,
Stands now proteAed by a feeble guard.

'Tt 'Thanks for thy welcome tidings, noble Gartlha/

The guardian gods of Rome berd from their fkries,
And point this adtion out. Hear me, my father !
if ever since my birth I gave thee joy,
If e'er thou did'iI, as parents oft are wont,
Inter~pret large the promif'e of my childhood,
O hear and grant my chief and dear requelt i
L~et me go forth : be this my firit: exploit,
To wrap in fire the ty;rant's boasted tower ;
'That Rome, who glories in th' Jt~mlian line,
Mlay join your 'Ttus to his kindred names!i

Or some superior pow~er thy bosom fires,
Wihom Ioppole no more. Go, and fulfil
'h~y destiny. Brave Gartha too thall add
His troops to thine. Prepare what elf'e-

'Ti. 'fis done.

.Deficua ve infiruments and balls of fire
Are ready at the gate.

./Emil. Farewel, my s~on !

If you prevail, urge not too far your fortune.
Remnember i'till my words i that when we meet,
i~may have cause to praise thy conduat then,
As now thy courage, 7itus.

r'Ti. Gar·tha, come !

[ESxeu~nt Titus and Garthna.

./Emtil. Pauhal, lead thou thy legion to the gate,

And favour their retreat, Itmay be needful;
Bu~t mix not in the fight, for mighty cities
Have been by fach temerity furpriz'd.

Paul. Would that there was no Roman breast more

[prone

To rash attempts, than mine ! I with, my lord,
T'hat I had led, and aTitus had fufltain'd me.

" Be sparing of your troops ; protrait the frege ;

' Thou art the thield of Rqme and Gordianus."'

AfZmil. Soldier, return, and publish tt> the legions

The welcome tidings of a near relief.

Op-. Gladly, my lord. M/uch have the troops en-

[~dur d,

And with unihakren constancy they fuffer.

[Exit Offcer.

Paul. H-ad this advice arriv'd 'ere Titus went,

I think he hardly h~ad obtain'd permiiron.
Tho' Mlaxzimrin thould raile an hundr~ed towers,
And, like the Giants when they warr'd with Jove,
Pile mountains on each other, high as heaven,
For three thort days his fury wre may scorn.

Amil. Go, and prevent the sally. Tell thy brother,

Wh~at the imperial mandate here contains.
It is the e~mpe·~rockcomr mand recalls him,

Paucl. W-ith pleathre I obey. [Exit Paulus.
A ~Enillus alone ] I must reserve

M/y sons, -my rfodiers, for a nobler service,
Anid in thle battle aid the Roman arms,
The hour approaches that mnuff give to Rome
A legal lord, by her own fuffr age. chosen,
Or fix a barb'rous master o'er mankind.
That barb'rous master If hall never own.
If I could sloop to drag the servile chain,
And live the vassal of a vile Dal matian,
Yet I could not conceal me in the croud
Of proffrate Romans ; I that Ltoad aloft,

And

And bore thro' Italy the fenate's flandard.
Fast by that: flandard will I plant my foot,
There with my boys a glorious coriquett gain,

Behold the only obje~t t-hat: can fLake
One moment my resolve I1 W6hat will become
Of thee, Cornelia!I doom'd perh aps to live, .
Like Priam's wretched queenl, the slave of thiofe
By whom her sons, ·her ·husb~and, country ~fell.

Ente~r Cornelia andr Priest.·

Corn. Why is my lord alone ? Where. are my sons ?-
Amil.This day, Cornlelia, brings its welcome tidings,

The Emperor approaches with his hoff.

Corn. Thanks to the gods ! But fay, where are my

[children ?

Amnil. Thisinitarit I expe~t them to return.
Corn. Fr~om .whence, Amilius ?
AcImil. From the northern gate,

s~tuds had form'd a brave, a great design;
Buat when assurance of relief arriv'd,
AMy Paulucs haften'd to recal his brother.

Corn. 'Tis as I- fear'd. PaulusJ will come too late.

The omens of the giods muff be fulfill'd.

Amtil What evil omens has Cornelia seen ?
Corn. 'Tis fitrange to tell ; but as 1 flamb'ring~lay,

About that hour when glad Aurora springs,
To( chace the lagging thades, methought I was
In Rome, and full of peace the city feem'd.
MLy mind oblivious too had loft its- care.
Serene I flep'd ~along the lofty hall,
Imbellith'd with the flamues of our fathers,
When suddenly an univers~al groan
Iffuedi at once fr~om eirery marble breaff.
Aghast I gaz'd around ! when slowly dowun
From their high pedestals I saw descend
T'he murder'd Grac~chi. Hand in hanld, the brothers
Stalk'd tow~ards me. As they approach'd more near,

T-hey .

They were no more the Gracchi, but mty sons
Pauslus and T~itus. At that dreadful change
SI hriek'd and wak'd. But never from my mind
The fpediaclethall part. Their rueful eyes I
Their cheeks of itone i the look of death and woe i'
So (trange a vision ne'er from fanc'y role.
The reft, my lord ! this holy Priett can tell.

Ak*/. Why this is nothing but a commonl dream ;

For often when the waking mind is charg'd
With appreheniion of uncertain ills,
Imagination, in the hour of reft,
Prelenteth wjId fagntaic combinations,
That have a thade and ciniture of' the~ past :
But 'tis the weakners of the human mind
That joins the vain assemblage to futurity.

Pr·ie. Mbenl reafron thus, my lord ! who think their

[reafoa

Can graip and measure all I prefunriptuous thought !
Sounds more than human have been oftren heard,
And thapes celeitial seen, by mortal man;
But yet molk frequent in the silent night
Are warnings given by rcrange portentous dreams.
The hiffory of mighty Rome abounds
Jn awf'ul inflances. The old republic
By them has oft been fivay'di, and oft preferv'd.

Affmil. But tell me, Priest ofJove ! what do the gods

By their more certain omens now declare ?

Priefl. Consul.! with the notit venerable rites

That our religion knowcrs, I have perform'`d
A sacrifice to Capitolian Josve,
This pious matron pref~eat: never yet
Since at the altars of the god~s I~ flood
Did I behold Iach omens of calamity.
Yet they were intricate, ambiguous, dark ;
Aind tho' foine parts I might interpret fCair,
Even ther~e were mix'd and full of dire perplexity,
Ndo further can I fee into the cloud,
That veils the will oi heaven ; but this I fay,
And by the sceptre of' the god I s~erve
lt is the truth: Some d~readful dange~r hangs
O'er thee thyfel f, this city, or thy race.

For if the confail thould this city yield,
Inevitable death abides his sons.

f~it. I flood the chance of war. Do not bewail

A fate to far above my highest hope
When last we parted. Men are born to die.

Cor. But not like thee, in youth untimely slain.
Tit. T'his a~tive -day has been an age of life.

Rom2e is deliver'd. Thou haft itill a l~on.
Why mourns my brother o'er a foldier's fall ?

Pau. I griev'd not, Thius!i when our lot was eqjual,
Cor. T~here will be wars again to thiatch thee too.

Fear not too long a life : the useless live,
TShe vile, the odious; thy desert is death.

Tit. My limbs grow weak, upon the earth I'll reft~.

Have I redeem'd my rathnefs? O my father !

TSo thee Rome owes her s~afety, her exifience;
Andi with her chief deliver~ers ranks thy name.

Of death comes near my beart.

O let me not diflurb his parting foul.

Of Romani virtue ! to lament for thee,
Wtith common wailings, were a feeble part;
And far beneath the spirit of thy fall;
Unworthy of thy father.

Cor. I muff behold the dead. Fear not exer~s,

In arms, viatorious o'er thy proffrate foe.

Himself, his brother, and his country free.
No height, beyond the s~ummit where he flood,
On earth remain'd: that he might ne'er descend,
The gods could only grant a death like his.

And let the murick of the legions found
A warlike iymphony, whole firains expreifs
O~ur mingled slate of triumph, and of sorrow.

In antient Lore ; in Latin, nor in Gr~eek.

I therefore did adwyz'e himl, as a friend,
so mak~e his lear~ninga serv-e ome uleful end :
An l~et mre knIOw, 4lihat rules be hard obfers'd ;
What unitier of time and placeprefereu'd.
He aquwer'd, Poetry is not an art ;
'~Tis nature onlyr fmraes the poet's head~ :
Still as he thin~ks, the /cenle be feels aloqg,
And from his bofomt burf a the raptur'd song.
fbis is the sacred oracle, the }brine
T~he bard cons~ults, and here, the tuneful Nine.
Wvith the famne f e, the hearer's f'oul mufJglow,
E/Se Ivain to himz, the tale of tragick ·roe.
There is a temper, whlich is all in all:
That founds' reff onfe·e to the poet's call
Like M emnon's harp zuhich pour'd harmonioucs laysr·
Wlhene'er its frings werep tourch'di by ]Ph(Ebus' rays.
This tempter of~ the foul i~S feet and 2wildl;
ItJ'obs, or fmtiles, als JuddIenaS a child ;
To woes imagin'dl teatrs unfeigne girves,
And in the poet's urorld of- fancy licves.

W~hi/ thus hlbe fpoe, a bell waus heard io r~in ;

He foi~pfd, and fartted likte a guilty thingq ;
Ere the dread curtain ro/e, in haf2e w~ithdr·ew,
dnd at a dqla~nce writs bis doom from yous.
