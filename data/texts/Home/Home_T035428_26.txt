# PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. BARRY.

P R O L 0 G U E.

Spoken by Mr.B A R R Y.
W HEN first the children of the Muse began

To try their magic on the mind of man,

Aftonifh'd mortals saw, with wond'ring eyes,
The fair creation of the bard arise.

Hence is derived the Poet's lofty name,

For Poet and Creator mean the fame;
He, from his fancy, where the feeds of things,
As in a chaos lie, to order brings
Worlds of his own.arid builds the lofty rhyme
Whose polisi'd ftrei/gth defies the rage of time.

Such were the bards, whom we too call divine,

Homer the father of the godlike line,
The Mantuan bard, whom all mankind admire
For sweet expression and for vesta! fire.
Shakefpear and Mgilton; both in England born,
Whose glorious names the Queen of Isles adorn,
Who, proudly fitting on her azure throne,
In arts and empire will no equal own.

Thus far our Author as a Prologue writ,

And wouldhave been, I think, a-writing yet,
Enamour'd of his theme.-But I drew near,
And whifper'd that of him you wish'd tohear,

'Twas difficult he faid-in such a cafe

He could have wisi'd another in his place;
To tell with what alternate hopes and fears,
An anxious Author on the Stage appears;
For, likethenightingale, he hath addreft
Himfelfto fing--a thorn at his fond breast;
[f, like the native warbler of the grove,
His plairtive notes are full of tender love;
Your hand may pull the thorn that caus'd his pain
And give him spirit for a nobler firain,

THE
FATAL DISCOVERY.

ACT. I.

S C E N E, a Grove, with Trees blown down.
Enter K A T H U L, King of the Isles, and feve-

ral of his Attendants.

FIRST ATTENDANT.
K I N G of the Ines-

K A T H U L.

I'11 hear no more: begone !

Back to the mountains where you left your lord,
Nor dare return without him to the vale.

[Exit Attendants.
Enter E U R A N.

E UR A N.

How have those men provok'd their prince's wrath ?
Soft is the voice of Kathul to his people.
What evil have they done ?

B KATHUL'

K A T H U L.

My faithful Euran!

Thbfe daitards left their mailer in the storm
That role at eve: my son hath pass'd the night
Alone upon the hill beyond the lake.

E UR AN.

Of him no fear; both hill and dale he knows,
Cavern and cave and every thelter'd spot
Of the wide forest.

K A T H U L.

Not one moment's peace

Have I enjoy'd, since to the PiCcifh king
I gave my daughter's hand. Unhappy she,
In secret anguish pines her life away !
My son, affiiced, ihuns his father's fight,
And, in the woods and forests, waftes his days,
A lonely hunter. To complete my woes,
Our new ally keeps not his promis'd time,
Is this his Picilh faith ?

E U R A N.

Doubt not, 0 king !

Doubt not the faith of Durftan, nor the love
He bears his queen.-Soon mhall you fee his fails
Rife on the diitant wave, white as the fowls
That chafe the flying shoals.-When he arrives,
Let not indulgence grant the leait delay,
But waft Rivine to the Pi&tifh mhore.
When m{e has left the place, where every tree
And rock and haunted tream recal the memory

Of

Of what ihe mhould forget, her grief will fly
,ike miflt before the wind.

K A T H U L.

Rather the mif[

Will thicken into darkness. Euran, my heart
Misgives and chides itself. Sprung as I am
From ancient Albion, in her evil days
I left her fhatter'd fide. By paflion fway'd
And rage at perjur'd Ronan, I forsook
The stock of which I came, andjoin'dmyfelf
By ftric alliance to her mortal foe;
To him, whose arm had hew'd her branches down.
From deeds, like this, in wrong of nature done,
Observers date commencement of decay,
And strange disaster to the guilty line.

E U R A N.

Disaster seize on him who broke his faith,
And threw away the pearl of womankind!
0! could my wish recal that signal hour
When Elig's hall blaz'd with a thousand shields
Of kings and heroes. Emulous to please
The all admir'd daughter of the Isles!
Rivine, partial to her brother's friend,
Preferr'd the Prince of Morven ; tho' by far,
In wealth and power, inferior to the PiO:,
And other royal suitors for her love.
Yet he, diftinguifh'd, favour'd, honoured thus,
Ungrateful man ! forsook the matchless maid,
Without complaint, pretence, abandon'd her,

B z To

To wed the queen of Erin *.-In my mind
Most happily for thee, and for thy house;
Else thou, the friend of vanquilh'd Albion, fdl!
Hadctt har'd the fortunes of a ruin'd people.--

K ATHUL.
Not ruin'd yet-

E U R A N.

ExpelI'd their native land,
Their king-and more than halfhis princes slain.

K'A THUL.

Another king succeeds : Congallus claims
His right of blood.--Here in the bay last night
A rover of the main his vessel moor'd;
He told me he had seen on Nonvay's coast
A fleet Immense: far off, it feem'd a wood,.
Stretching from cape. to cape; as if the firs
From their eternal mountains had come down,
To grow amidst the waves.

E U R A N,

Was this huge fleet
Prepar'd against the Pic ?

K ATHUL.

It was ;' and charg'd

With mighty armies: both the kings were there
Oft Lochlin and of Norway--On the deck
Of one, the headmot lihip, Congallus stood,
TWooing the winds to fill his hoilted fails:
Wit.h him a multitude of warriors, born
In various climes, of the Albanian race;
W,5-ho, though they never law their father's land,

s Ireland, ' Denmark.

Call it their country too. The foremost they,
The fiercest in her cause.

EUR A.N,

'Tis Ronan's cause!

For him the sons of Erin lift the spear;
For him the kings of Scandinavia arm.
But let them tome, the pirates of the North!-
Strong is the PiA, and mighty his allies !
Who can refit the Romans ?

K A T H U L.

By their force,

And not his own, tho' he is great in arms,
The Pit o'er Albion's warlike sons prevail'd;
But now the Roman eagle southward flies;
The dark-ey'd chief his legions has withdrawn,
To quell the Britons; nor can Duritan hope
Their present aid.-

E U R A N.

-I truit he ihall not need 1
Behold Rivine comes- [Looking towards the wood.

K A T H U L.

-Entranc'd in thought-

See how the toffes to the Skies her arms,
Now wrings her folded hands! Thus is (he wont
To wander thro' the woods, ever alone,
And ever mourning. Like awounded deer,
Apart she stalks and seeks the darkest shade
Of hanging rocks, and melancholy boughs,
To hide and nourimf her determin'd sorrow.-

Let

Let us avoid her. 0! unhappy child!
I fear thy father's counsel has undone thee! [Exeunt.

R I V I N E.

How soon is evil done ! The sycamores,
The pines, whose bulk fuccefilve ages rear'd,
The tempeflt of one night hath overthrown !
Thou too art fallen, thou fair and itately oak,
Beneath whose pleasant mhade Rivine fate,
When first fe listen'd to false Ronan's love.
O ! thou expressive emblem of my itate !
Like thee, the chief in beauty and in place,
I flourila'd once; now rooted up like thee,
I wither on the field. Daily I die!
Delighted, I perceive my swift decay,
There will I make my Grave; under that rock
In peace shall reft the daughter of the Isles,
Who, 'till fie's laid in earth, no peace can know.
Ko peace for me! 0 ! how I envy you,
Ye lovelorn maids! who, flighted and forsaken,
Yet entertain no motion of revenge,
But mildly bear your wrongs, decline and die,
The blameless vicims ofinconltant man !

Enter CONNAN.

Ha I does my brother come to fee Rivine !
What has procur'd me this unwonted favour ?

CONN A N.

Perhaps in Prudence and in love to thee,
i huld conceal my tidings; but my heart

Cannot

Cannot contain them. Tho' it make thee wretched,
Yet I must tell thee, that my friend is wrong'd.
Ronan is innocent; he loves thee frill;
He never ceas'd to love thee!

RIVINE.

I believe it.

He never ceas'd to love, who never lov'd.
But why pretend, why counterfeit again ?
Has Erin's queen found out how false he is,
And thrown the specious traitor from her arms ?
And does he think once more to find Rivine
Free, credulous, and fit to be deceiv'd ?
But me he thinks not of; he courts thy aid;
He needs the valour of his partial friend.
A stranger still to what his crimes have done,
He knows not who I am; he does not know,
That Connan's valour guards the Pitifh throne.

C 0 N N A N.

This flash of indignation, O ! my sifter!
Gleams for a moment o'er thy troubled mind;
But darkest woe mhall shortly close around thee.
I Ihave a dreadful story for thine ear.-

RIVINE.

A dreadfuil story! how can he be wrong'd,
Who publicly renounc'd his plighted faith,
Plighted a thousand times ?

C 0 N N A N,

He never did:
He lent no meffilge to renounce thy love.

R'I V I N E.

R I V I N E.
What then was Valma?

C 0 N N A N.

An unhappy wretch,

The slave of gold; gain'd by the worit of men,
To work thine overthrow.

R I V I NE.

Leave me tojudge
Of my condition. Tell me what thou know'ft.

C 0 N N A N.

I need not tell Rivine why I shunn'd her,
Since Duriftan was her husband; I have fled
The human race, distracted in my mind,
'With grief and shame and anger: oft my foul
Refolv'd revenge on Ronan. By-and-by
Something would whisper that we were deceiv'd ;
That noble Ronan never could be base.
Perplex'd with thoughts like these I rang'd the woods,
And heeded not the game my dogs purfu'd.
The storm of yesterday furpriz'd me, ftray'd
Beyond my usual bounds; nor could I find,
Amidst the darkness of the driving blast,
A path to guide aright my doubtful steps.--
As night came on, more furious grew the form.
The thunder bellow'd'and the lightning glanc'd
Along the dreary heath: before, behind
And on each fide, the sudden torrents roar'd.
I wander'd on and frequently I thought,
The world without was like my troubled mind.
At last, far in tihe eaffl whence the wind blew,

I heard

I heard the howling of a Ihepherd's dog;
With lighter steps, I turn'd me to the found
And heatd it oft repeated. As I hop'd,
Itl ed me to a hut-I enter'd there
And, by the embers of a fire of turf,
I saw a ghastly man ftretc&'d on a bed
Of ticksand heath compos'd. Come near, he said,
And lifeni to the dying voice of Valmia.---

R I V I N E.
Of Valma !-

C 0 N N A N.

Valma, whom I had not seen

Since he, for Erin, with his master fail'd:
I found he did mistake me for his holt,
And silent listen'd with a beating heart.
Your charitable cares, he said, are vain;
Myhotlr draws nigh,--Goodlhepherd,you havelodg'd;
Under your blameless roof, the basest wretch
That ever liv'd on earth. My name is Valma,
The favour'd servant of the prince of Morven.
My master sent me, from green Erin's more,
With tokens and a meflage to his love,
The fair Rivine: but a tempest drove
My luckless vessel on the Pi:tilh coast.
Durftian, the king, by promises and threatS,
Compell'd me to deceive the constant maid,
And falsely to report, that my brave lord
Renounc'd!r Jove.-Rivine, thou grow'ft pale 1
Lean on rny arm.--.

C XIVINE.

RIVINE.

- No: I have strength enough !

Lead me, my brother! ilead me to.the place
WVbere Vaima-is.

CONNAN.

At midnight he expir'd-

.R I V I N E.

Would he had liv'd one other day for me !
0! I had much to ask him: did not Ronan,
With eyes of love beholdthe beauteous queen ?
So I have orften heard, and that was told
Long before Valma came.--

CONNAN.

Ay, so it was

Contriv'd and told, on purpose to prepare
Thy mind, thus tainted, to receive the tale.
But know, for I explor'd the heart of Valma,
The noble Ronan, in the hall of kings,
Who fought alliance with so brave a chief,
Fondly difplay'd-his paftion for Rivine.
With'gems of thine he deck'd his conq'ring arms,
And rais'd the song of beauty to thy praise !
Such oatentadion wither'd the desire
And killd the hope of every blushing maid.
The hero comes, unalter'd in his love,
And finds thee---

RIVINE.
Connan! me he shall not find !'
We ne'er fnall meet again-when does lhe come ?

CONNAN.

CO N N A N.

Be-like to-morrow, or perhaps to day.
This is the appointed time, the season meet
For enterprize of arms. Now thle mild moon
Of autumn rifes when the fun descends,
And at the self fame hour, for many a night, -
Lifts her fair Head, to bless with light the world.
I mean to share the perils of my friend ;
Nor shall Rivine as an hostage go
Against her brother's and her Ronan's sword.

RIVIN E.

Would that the swords of both were in my breast s
Ye winds, that I have wish'd mhould sleep for ever
Ye fouthbern winds ! from Etha's mountains blow,
And waft to Elig's bay the PiAifh fleet!
I go to Durftan's kingdom--

C 0 NN A N.

Go, and periih!

Haft thou no rage, no indignation_ in thee ?
No generous drop in thy exhausted reins?
Art thou so tame, so vile, so base of foul,
To bear the fight of Duritan? Crimes like his
Dissolve all ties. Betides his wrongs to thee,
He murder'd Valma on the lonely heath;
Murdcr'd the traitor to conceal the treason,

RIVINE.

Yes, I am base and vile; my foul submits
To each opprobrious name from Ronan's friend;
But I am hot so tame: my heart is full
Of rage, of anger and of mortal hatred!-

Cz . CONNAN'

C 0 N N A N,
?o whom?

RIVINE,
To Duriftan's wife.

C 0 NNA N.

Renounce the name,

And thou may's fti-ll-Thy brother will defend,
And save thee from his power.

R I V I N E.

O ! save not me

From any misery! But tell me rather,
How I may be more wretched than I am ;
If thou can'st tell. Farewel my native land.!
Ye woods and streams of Elig's vale, farewel
Rivine leaves you with a broken heart,
To waste her days in horror and despair,
With the detested author of her woes.
Bur welcome woe to me ! Fool that I was,
A wretch unworthy of a hero's love,
Who readily believ'd a lying tale,
Against the honour of the first of men:
Then in the cursed hour of jealous rage,
Gave up myself to misery and Durftan.

And .ears the colours of the Piatih king.

RIVINE.

'Tis too late !-

I ihould have thought before I wedded Durftan.
Now would'it thou have me stay till Ronan comes?
~Tis not his anger, nor his hate I fear;
No, nor his scorn. My just desert is scorn;
But hide me, rocks and mountains, from'his pity!
As the fond parent to the child relents,
When fore affli&ion lays th' offender low;
So would his generous foul to pity melt,
Should he behold the ruins of Rivine!
Come, Piaifh Durftan ! bear me from his fight,
To die unpitied in thy hated land I-- [E£it.

C 0 N N A N.

She's defperate--and what will Ronan be,
When, high in hope, he hears he's loft for ever?
His words, his gestures I remember well,
When last we parted at the veffrel's fide:
From his embrace I turn'd me to the liore:
His arm he ftretch'd, and caught my hand again ;
He prest it to his breast, he wrung it hard;
And, with a look of infinite affe&ion,
Connan ! he said, my king commands; I go:
To thee, my friend, I leave my love in charge !
Fondly I promis'd to defend the maid.
What ihall I answer when he claims his bride ?--
She must notgo with Durftan. 0 ! myfire!
Thy wrath I fear, and nor the Piccifh fwvord!
But Ronan has my faith. Where is my page,
So fwittf of foot ? Thy master calls thee, Calmar.

Would I had never join'd my hand to his,

And now at last believe, 'tis fiafer far
To deal deceitfully with crafty men,
Than pratife art on unexperienc'd youth,
Whose passions sally out beyond conje&ture,
And, by extravagance, confound the wife.

To these injurious words, I know not, Queen!
What answer best belongs. Thy gloomy mind
Some foul fuipicion of thy husband stains,
Changing to hatred and to harlh disdain,
That melancholy and that cold reserve,
Which I regretted once. Unfold thy thoughts !
And shew the viper that has stung thy foul.
Sheheeds me not. Ha! wherefore doltthou tremble,,
And fitare so wildly on a stranger's face ?

Will I reply to passion. Thou haft nam'd
The owner of the sword. His it may be;
But whose it' was, I never knew before.

R ,Iy I NE.

Thou can'fl no more deceive me. The long train
Of treachery and lies, the murder too
Has been deteced. Miserable Valma
Liv'd only to reveal it.--Now thoucom'ft,
With this proud trophy of thy work complete.
0 ! thou sole relique of the first of men!
Signal of death ! memorial of the brave !
Companion of my woes, perhaps the end!
Why didft thou thirst, 0! Durfan for his blood ?
Hadit thou not wrong'd him, was not that enough '
But thou didfrt wifely, to consult thy safety;
For conscience told thee, whilst the warrior liv'd,
T'he robber was not safe.

D U R S T A N.

Thy words are madness;
IfI had kilr'd him, was he not my foe ?

R I V I N E.

How did the hero fall ?-By fraud he fell!
For he was still invincible in arms,
Alone a march for many in the field,

D U R S T A N.

That sword, the fight of which disturbs thy foul,
Is not the trophy of a hero slain
In evil hour I found it.

' If he was near,

Thou haft conjectur'd right, he lives no more:
Far where I found it, death and horror reign'd.

RIVINE.

Now, I believe thee, Durftan! Tell me, Picft!
How, when, without a master too thou found'ft
His sword who never yet was foil'd in arms ?

D R S T A N.

As in our way to thee we croft those seas,
3Whose rage scarce summer tames, a tempest rose,
A dreadful one, as ever swept the main.
All night we labour'd in the jaws of death,
But, when the morning dawn'd, the tempest ceas'd
Red, on the troubled deep, the fun arose,
_And shew'd a difimal object to our eyes;
Failt, on a ridge of rpcks, awreck appear'd,
Which feem'd the ruin of a noble vessel;
Near as our safety would permit we fail'd,
Andview'dthefate,which mighthavebeen ourown.--
The hip was broken by the heavy seas,
Parted in two; and all about the rciks
Dead bodies floated on the toffiling waves.

R I V I N E.
Wvas there no living creature ?

D U R S T A N.

No, not one,

Low are the rocks; their ragged tops are tieen,
And barely seen above the smoothest sea;
But in a storm their place is known afar,
By the white waves, that rage, and fwvell, and break

Lik.e

Like mountains o'er them; there no man could live.
Who'er aboard that luckless vessel fail'd,
Embrac'd the fame inevitable doom.--:

R I V I N E.
Was the sword there ?

D U R S T A N.

It was. About to' leave

The wreck, we fought some token of the dead
By which they might be known, that sword we spiedd
Caught in the cordage of a mast it hung
And glitter'd through the water.-

R I V I NE.

WTis enough!

If at my feet his breathless body lay, .
I could not be more certain of his fate.
In those wild waves the chief of warriors died;
To me he hasten'd through the seas and storms;
Unknowing of his wrongs for me he died.

And

And of what high renown, is not unknown;
For thro' the kingdoms of the North his name
Flew on the wings of Fame.-His love to me .
And mine to him, for I avow my love,
My fee approv'd.-To him I was betroth'd,
But in his absence, Duritan did seduce,
A faithless servant to betray his mailer.
He fram'd a meflage from the noble Ronan,
Rejeting me, and setting free my faith
Then urg'd a fond exasperated maid,
And with the help of her deceived father,
Precipitated her diforder'd mind,
To yield a ralh confent--That was my crime,

King of the Isles !

On Mora's top the fiery signal burns.
I saw a troop, in Ihining steel array'd,
Descend the hill, by acive Calmar led.

K A T HVLI

K A T H U L.

Whose hand presumes to light the warning fire
That never.burns in peace ? Where is my son ?
The feet of Calmar fly at his command.

MESSENGER.

To war they fly, On the high-pointed rock
That runs into the bay, Connan himself
Stands like a tow'r. His angry voice he fends,
Along the roaring waves, and shakes his spear
Against the Pi&s approaching to the fore.--

D UR ST AN.
I am betray'd.

KATHUL.

Of me diftrufRful too?

D U R S T A N.

The son my enemy, I dread the fire.
My brave companions, whose renown in arms,
Role on the ruins of a greater foe
Than Connan is, or those who swell his pride,
Now let your valour ihine. At bay we stand,
But not like timid deer.

FIRST PIC T.

Our lives are thine;
With thee we conquer, or with thee we fall.-

K A T H U L.

Some angry spirit hovers in the air,.
And scatters rage and fury. Hear me, Pi&t:!
Suspicion argues oft a gutilty mind
A noble spirit never. Sheath your swords !

I am

I am your guard in Elig. To the hore
I go to quell the tumult, and receive
Thy people as my friends.-My daughter! hear
Thy father's counsel, Never was a child
To a fond parent dearer. O ! Rivine!
Much of my hope is loft ; but do not thou,
In raih refentrrmient, throw the reft aivay.
Think who thou art i the daughter of a king~
And of a king the wife! the pledge of peace
Among the nations; be not thou the cause
Of war and mortal strife i thy name lhall go,
To future times for good, or ill-fenowri'd~
The curse or blessing of thy native land,
And of thy father's house. My child be wife f
Forget the patr, which cannot be recall'd;
And arm thyself with patience.--

[Exit Kathul aMd Euran:
D U R S T A N.

Sweet the voice

Of those that counsel peace. Rage was not made
Nor lasing angeri for a gentle breast. -
My foul is innocent of Ronan's fate;
And if I used some art against a rival,
Ascribe it only to excess of love.-
Wife are thy father's words. Forget the past,
And be hereafcer happy.--

RIVINE.

Leave me, Pici!

I hate the present; I abhor the past !
The time to come, Durfian is not for me,

I haftea

I haften to the Tomb! There Ih mall find
Forgetfulness. 0! leave me to my sorrows!
Leave me to die here in my native land,
Where once with peace and innocence I liv'd
(Companions whom my foul hall know no more)
Till thou cam'ft hither. Thou hall made mewretched
Beyond all utterance, example, thought
Or itretch of fancy. When the mournful bard
Seeks a fad subjet for the midnight song,
He shall reje& the woes of other times,
And choose Rivine for the tale of tears.

'Tis my chief duty to renounce that state,
And thee for ever. [Going.]

DURSTAN.

Hence thou must not go.
I will not truss thee to thy own disposal.-

RIVINE.
Am I a captive ?

DURS TAN.

No, nor art thou free

To cast thy husband off. Foul shame it were
For me to susser such contempt from thee.
'Willing or not, forthwith thou must embark;
Thy prudent father yielded his consent;
Be thou perfuaded.rather than compell'd.

By mixing with thy threats a name of safety.

CONNAN.

My Tafety, Pi&t, depends not on thy will.
Behold my force, to thine superior far.---

[Calmar appears, with the warriors of Connan.

But fair and equal, man to man, I meet thee,
I use no vile deceitful arts like thee.
I take no bale advantage of a foe.-

CONNAN.

Haft thou not wrong'd my friend ?
And dolt thou aflk if Connan be thy foe ?

Alas, the friend of Connan lives no more!
Behold!-

CONNAN.

'Tis Ronan's sword; with life and this

At once the hero parted. Ah! my filter!
How came it hither ?

R I V I N E.

Durfnan!
CONNAN.

Ha! the spoils
Of Ronan by .his foe in triumph borne !

No

No tears I shed: red are thy drops, revenge!
Durftan, call up thy courage ; rear thy crept,
And to a bold defiance, boldly answer.
I charge'thee first with treachery and falsehood,
Crimes that fitrike down the warriors gallantplumes;
With murder next, for wretched Valma's death;
For Ronan last; for Ronan, basely slain;
By hands like thine, he could not el1f have fallen,
With mortal hate I call thee to the combat.

RIVINE.

My Brother, hear me ! Not by Durftan's hand,
N.or by the arm of man, did Ronan'fall.
Far from the mhore, amidst the iftormy waves,
.mongft the cordage of a vessel wreck'd
The sword was found.-Forgiven be my wrongs,
And to his kingdom let the PiA return.

D U R S T A N.

Great is thy clemency! Permit the Pi&,
Injur'd, defy'd, difhonour'd, to be gone.-
Is Duriftan's name of such account in Elig?
Are these the terms on which he quits the field ?
Connan, thy challenge and thy wrath I scorn
Thy sifter, as my queen, I jufitly claim:
If she's with-held, I shall lay waste your Isles,
And to ,py kingdom's add one sceptre more.

CONNAN.

If ihe desires to pass her days with thee,
She is not worth the splinter of a spear.
But if her foul reveres her lover's shade,
And flies from thee to solitude and sorrow,
My sword from insult ihall the mourner guard.-

E2 Thy

Thy threats I laugh at; thou unwarlike king.
To boast of conquest and refuse the combat.
Wilt thou not fight, thou chief without a foul ?
Then fly without delay. Now make thy choice,
Begone or draw thy sword !

D U R S T A N.

Vain-glorious youth !

Thou fit companion of the boaster Ronan,
Whom I could with this moment in thy place i
I'll seek the king. Ifhedenies mejuftice,
Unworthy as thou art of Durftan's sword,
Expe&t me soon.

Thou wilt not come so loon
As Cornnan withes.-- [Exit Durfitan and PiCts.

R IVINE.

Why this strife for me ?

Who should be shunn'd like the infectious blast,
Which, where it takes, destroys. Ronan is dead,
Let not the friend of Ronan fall for me.
I have a refuge sure. Behold yon cliff,
Whose summit, jutting o'er its wave-worn base,
Darkens the deep below.

C 0 N N A N.

Fly from despair!

And seek the shelter of thy brother's love,-
The friend of Ronan will prote& Rivine.
If the pale ghost that dwells amidst the storm
Retains th' affections of its former state,
O'er us the ghost of Ronan hall rejoice.-
To Elig's towers thou muff not now return.

Come

Come on; I'll lodge thee in a place of safety, '
The cave of fad Orellan: now the tide,
Retiring, leaves a passage cross the bay.-

And watch as if ihe girded my repose. [Exeunt.

SC EN E, a Cliff on the Sea-hore, with a Cave.

RIVINE and ORELLAN.

0 R E L L A N.

B E H O L D the habitation of Orellan
For threescore years and ten this rock has been
My dwelling place; and here I fit in sorrow,
Silent and motionless from morn to eve;
'Till the sea-fowl, that kidm along the shore,
Fearless alight, and, fitting at my feet,
Scream their wild notes, as if I was a stone
Or senseless trunk, that could not do them harm.--
It was not always thus; I was not born
To misery; nor in the wild woods bred
Of savage race; fair was my morn of youth!
With thy brave grandsire I was train'd to arms,
His chosen warrior, and his trusted friend.
But love andjealoufy furpriz'd my foul,
Drove me from men, and blotted out my name.
This arm flew Namora.

RIVINE.

Father, forgive

My importunity! Vouchsafe to tell
What I in panrt have heard.

ORELLAN.

OR E LLAN.

My story's old,

·Thy.forrow recent: butto hear my woes
WVill teach thee patience. Such as thou art now,
Or as thou waft, e'er grief had made thee wan,
Namora was. Like thine, her beauty charm'd
Contending princes; but the generous maid
Preferr'd to princes fond Orellan's love.
Daily we met in woods, in groves, in glades,
Remote and secret. One unhappy time,
Returning from the chace, I fought the grove.
Ent'ring, I saw Namora; her white arms
E.mbrac'd a youth; her lips werejoin'd to his.
My bow was in my hand; I bent it loon,
And pierc'd them with one arrow. Ere I reach'd
The spot on which they fell, Namora's eyes
Were clos'd for ever. The expiring youth
Was her brave brother, to his native;fhore
That day return'd. His fitCer's steps he trac'd,
To perih in her arms. I kneel'dme downr
And begg'd the warrior, if he yet had strength,
To give me death. He heard me not, be died,
And left me living.-This bleak cave I chose,
My everlasting mansion. In those days
The hollow shore resounded with my cries.
Often the hunter hasten'd from the hill,
And oft the marin.r fteer'd from the deep,
And wonder'd at me. Time, that rage subdued
To milder grief. My tears inceflant flow'd
Like waters from the rock. Here have I mourn'd

An

An ageof man comnpleat. Alike to me
Summer and winter, autumn and the ifpring,
And night and day the fame.-

R I V I N E.

Thus would I wih

To waite my days, a fpe&acle of woe
Without or change or interval. I feel
Within myself a source and spring offorrow,
That ne'er will cease to flow, 'till death shall stop it;
Surely the spirits of the dead delight
To be remember'd, and lamented, father.

ORELLAN.

Daughter, they do-my own experience tells.-
Once every year, that day Namora died,
A wondrous vision comes. In the still air
(For not a breath then stirs the silent bay)
Are heard the saddest, yet the sweetest founds,
That ever touch'd the ear or heart of man,
The melody of woe.-Then from the skies
Descend the lhadows of the murder'd pair,
Pale as the colours of the lunar bow.
Hov'ring before the cavern's mouth they spread
Their arms ; they fix on me their pitying eyes,
And with a shriek, they vanilh into air:
Does hoar tradition tell a tale like this ?
Was ever mortal destiny like mine ?

R I V I N E.

Could I but hope to fee my love arise,
And look on me with pity; I would live
In the vast ocean on a rock alone.

But

But Ronan's injur'd ghost detests Rivine.---
In the dark world of spirits thou ihaltjoin
Thy dear Namora's iade; but far from mine
The angry spirit of my love will fly.--

O R E L L A N.

I have another charge besides thee, daughter!
Within my cave a wretched stranger lies,
Who tafled all the bitterness of death;
But scarce yet knows his wonderful escape.

RIVINE.
Escape from what ?

O R E L L A N.

From shipwreck in the storm
That raged last night upon the rocky Ihore.

RIVINE.

From ihipwreck! ha! Is he a man in years,
Or of the youthful time?

ORELL A N.

In prime of youth,

And beautiful he feem'd, tho' in the arms
Of death upon the naked beach he lay.
I found him there. Attentive I perceiv'd
That the warm life was not wholly fled.
I call'd a shepherd swain to give me help,
Who from a neighbouring hill furvey'd the deep;
He came, and willing in his arms he bore
The youth insensible; he brought him hither.
Within he lies, ftretch'd on the flins of deers;
A sleep profound has seiz'd him; when he wakes
He will not know, if in a friendly place,

F Or

Or in the dwelling of his foes he lies.-
I'll go-

R I V I N E..
Not yet a while.

0 R E L L A N.

Thy colour Ihifts

From pale to red, from red to pale again..
What dost thou hope or fear?

RIVINE.

A itrange event !'

Yet, like the fate and fortune of my life,
Wild and incredible. Perhaps this youth
Sav'd from the wreck, and sleeping in thy cell,.
Is Ronan.

ORELLAN;

No; delusive are thy hopes ;

The various vest and floating robe I know
Of Albion's warlike race. He wore not those.
His dress is splendid, bright with foreign gold,
And marks the chieftain of a distant land.

R IVINE.

Enter, and if he sleeps, to me return,
I will behold and bless him where he lies;
Then from his presence fly, if it is Ronan.

O R E L L A N.

I hear a noise within; the stranger comes;
His steps found on the rock.

RIVINE.

Now, now my heart!

Almost as muchas life.

Thou noble youth! nor call Rivine thine.

No, never, never more'!

I am unworthy of thy least regard;
Unworthy of the air that Ronan breathes.
When thou *salt know what cannot be conceal'd
Thou must abhor me.

R 0 N A-N.

I abhor Rivine!

Ah ! thou art chang'd indeed since I beheld thee!
Anguilh gleams in thy eye, and wild despair
Contends with fhame.-Rivine, speak and save me
From horrible conjeatures.

Whose heart is breaking! Fain, fain wou'd I speak,
And tell thee how Rivine was betray'd.

Fall down and cover with a heap my shame.
Follow me not! this hoary fire will tell
My crime; my misery cannot be told!

R O N A N.

It must be so. Thou confident of guilt,
Perhaps the punfellor!

To every circumstance of this misfortune,
And thou wilt pity her whom once thou Ioy'd'ft.

Is she not wedded?

And thou ihalt have an answer to thy question.

I have no patience for a tedious tale?
Answer at once: is he not wedded, fay ?
Then I may hear thy itory.

It were better,

Better for thee, rath youth ! to let me tell
How this difafer did o'ertake thy love.-

How tedious, hard, and obstinate is age!

R 0 N A N.
Then she is wedded ?

Dolt thou fay yes ?

OREL L A N.

Unwillingly I speak the painful truth:
My foul is griev'd for thee.

R.O N AN.

Thou art the cause

Of what I susser. Thy officious hand
Sav'd me from death, to make meperilh worse.
My lateit thought when finking in the storm
Was of Rivine; of her love, her truth,
Her grief eternal for her Ronan loft.-
And now I find her in another's arms;
Of me regardless, though my faithful heart,
Full of her image, for her fake defpis'd
The beauteous queen of Erin's warlike land.

OR E L L A N.
Young man ! thou wrong'it Rivine.--

And strong and valiant to defend her cause!
Let me behold the traitress, and confound
Her guilty foul.-'I'.

Go, give thy parion way,

Pursue and seize her in thy frantic arms;
Then throw her headlong from the airy cliff!

But she was rauth itself,

Durftan, my mortal foe !

The curst opprelor of my native land!
From all mankind has she selected him,
Whom most my foul abhorr'd ?

O R EL L A N.

She never chose:

She was betray'd, deluded, and compell'd.
Thy fervantValma, gain'd by-Dugitan's gold,
Deliver'd to Rivine a false meflage;
Cold and contemptuous, full of flight excuse,
For breach of faith 'confeft, and worst of all
Fraughtwith the praises of the beauteous queen,
Whole love had made thee lorcof Erin's land.

R O N AN.

ORELLAN.
How could The doubt it?

R ON A N.

Ha! did she not know me ?

Did not each action of my life belie
The monstrous tale ?

ORELLAN.

Long before that, the Isles

Resounded with the fame of thy great ats
In Erin's wars perform'd; and rumor spread
Abroad the ifory of the grateful queen.

R 0 N A N.
Wihere was my friend'?

O R E L.L A N.

When Durflan came to.Elig,

Connan.was absent in the distant isles;
His faith to thee this day of danger proves.

R ON A N.
This day!

O. R. E L L A N.

The fraud of Durifan was detected,

And from presumption strong thy death believ'd;
Rivine, who till then, conceat'd her anguish,

And:

And veil'd with sickly fmniles her broken heart,
Then own'd her love and publifh'd her despair.
'With threats the Pi&t requires his wedded wife:
Connan defies him, and demands the combat.

R 0 N A N.

I knew he wou'd; my brave, my faithful friend !
But mine the cause, and mine ihall be the combat.

The tribes are up in arms; for strong's the host
That haughty Duritan leads.

Never more welcome to thy master's hand.

And from that certainty derive the boldness
To offer to thine ear my last requef. ·
When I am dead, as I ihall ihortly be,
Think not too hardly of me. By the ghosts
And spirits of the air that wait for me,
I never ceas'd to love thee. My fond heart,
Ev'nwhen I thought thee false, and strove to hate thee,
Ev'n then my tortur'd heart was full of thee,
' ris this that fends me to an early grave;
I could not bear to be and not be thine.-

And thou art wedded to some lovely maid,
Worthy of thee, unlike the raih Rivine;
Then let thine anger cease! my fleeting ghost
For ever near thee hall some pleasure know.

May Durftan'sjav'lin nail me to the ground,
And may my dying eyes behold thee borne
Aboard his vessel, if I do not love thee !
Then of my pity j udge.-

RIVINE.

Thou giv'ft too much.

First let the earth receive my lifeless clay,
Refore thou pitieft me. My fate is six'd,
The place is chosen, where my tomb shall rife:
A little hillock in the narrow plain,
Beside the rock, faff by the water-fall,
Where in my better days we oft have met.
Shun not the place which thou wait wont to iov;-.'

And Armor bit the ground. Fiaft by the lake,

Spirits of earth and air! 'tis Ronan's form
Thus have I seen him haften to the field,
Thus fpiing exulting when the foe drew near.

KATHUL.

Oft have I heard the voice of mournful ghosts,
Borne on the wings of the careering winds,
But ne'er till now beheld-It stops and glares
With angry eyes on me. Speak thou, my son !
For ye were one.

Com'ft thou to urge thy Connan to revenge?

I have a thousand queftibns, but not now.
I must be sudden and abrupt, my friend !
The times are so.-Sad tidings thou must hear.
But let resentment chafe thy-grief away:
The salve of sorrow is a brave revenge.

RONAN N.

I come to seek revenge; my wrongs I know,
For I have seen Rivine. Where is Durftan ?
I hop'd to meet him in the battle's front;
But peace is here.

K A T H U L.

No, prince of Morven, no !

Peace dwells not here. Between the swords I came
Of raging warriors and obtain'd a truce
Until to-morrow's dawn. Altho' my hope
Of reconcilement at thy presence fades,

lMy troubled foul rejoices in thy safety.
Thy timeless death I mourn'd.

R O N A N.

King of the isles!
Why didft thou give thy daughter to the Pi& ?

O ! King! thou art the father of my friend?
The father of my lov'd my Joft Rivine.
And that restrains my tongue., Yet I must fay,
Hadst thou been constant to thy old allies,
Hadfl thou been faithful, and preferv'd my bride,
This day had crown'd thy hoary head with joy.
Impatient to behold my love, I fail'd
And left behind the Scandinavian fleet
Of warriors full. With these Ierne's sons
And Erin's chiefs for injur'd Albion arm.
Selma llall rife again.

May Selma rife,,

And Albion's honour'd race for ever reign.
Yet hear me, Ronan; from my heart I speak;
Thou bear'ft a noble mind; thy fame is great
Forjuftice as for valour; with the Pict
Thou haft a rightful quarrel, but refpe&
This hospitable shore; contend not here,
Nor fight with DurRfan for his wedded wife,

R O N A N.

Not fight with Duritan ! then let Durftan fly
And I shall follow, to whatever more,
He takes his flight.

I go to meet the antients of the land,
The hoary counsellors, who can compare
The present trouble with the times of old,
And call experience to vouch their counsel.
Under the spreading beech that Ihades the brook
They fit and ruminate. [Exit,

But, first, I'll tell thee thy detested deeds,

Unlike a prince, a warrior and a man,
Meanly thou ididft seduce a servile foul.
To wrong his master's honour and his love ;.

My aim is to bejuft, and to prevent

And bear the cause Hs Albion on thy fwvord.

Impartial terms of peace. He who believes
His cause isjuft, will readily assent.

Points the long ridge and terminates the bay;
There, in a cave, the sea-mnark of the main,
A man unlike the reest of mortals dwells!
Once great in arms, a-breast of mighty chiefs,
The brave Orellan trod the paths of Fame:
But strange misfortune croft the warrior's way.

In early youth he kili'd the fair he lov'd,
Then left mankind, to live alone with so.rrow (
Bare is his bosom to the howling winds,
And wet his hoary head, with foam that flies
From the resounding surges of the main;
The coot, the cormorant are his companions.
Sometimes, he fays, his cries Bring from her cloud
The pallid image of the murder'd maid !

I know the fad Orellan. To what end
Dost thou describe to us the man of sorrow ?-

He is the judge who cannot be unjust!
For his pure mind -no partial passion knows:
The sole affection of his breast is pity,
The man of sorrow feels for human woes!
To him submk the cause of doubtful strife,
And let his voice determine osRivine.

Is this thy counsel, king ? and dost thou think
That it will be regarded ? Shall Rivine,
Like sbcks or herds in contest, be adjudged ?
No. "Whilst-I live, Rivine shall be free;

Of him whose thoughts are open as his deeds!

But, with unwonted speed, thy course pursue,
'Till the grey eastern cloud grows red again,
Bef6re thy flaming ftfeps.-

Where is Rivine ?

CONNAN,

To some place remote,
Far in the forest, Calmar has convey'd her,

Uncertain is the spot, and vain it were
To seek her at this hour. Turn to the hall,
And for my fake speak gently to my father.

[Exit Connan.

R 0 N A N,

I with I could avoid the fight of him
And every person, When the heart is full
Of its own swelling thoughts, society
Is molefation. Solitude is best.
Ye woods and groves! where I was wont to roam
With her I lov'd; I left you in your glory !
Fair as the grove of June I left my love !
No: long my absence, yet the leaf is fallen.
Trees of the forest ! you mha!l hear again
The voice of pring and cloath yourselves anew.
In the green robe you loft-But never more
Shall bud or blofibm--Ha! what new event
Brings this keen messenger.

Enter E U R A N hastily.

E U R A N.

O prince of Morven !

Th'ny haughty courage and thy upright heart
-Excise thee to the fnafts of secret fraud
Which Duritan aims.

R O N A N.

'At me!
E U R A N.

Of that be judge.

\Vhiift every eye, secure of peace, is cloth'd,
Amidfl the darkness of the night he means
To bear Rivine from her father's house,

R O-

R ON A N,

Ha-! I believe it.

This is the secret which explains his conduc:,
Has he abettors in the house of Kathul,
Qr does the robber trust in force alone ?

E U R A N,
He trusts in me,

R O N A N.
In thee!
E U R A N.

I plant the watch

Which guards the hall of Kathul that he knows,
And with immense rewards assail'd my faith.
I feem'd to yield ; and thus the plan'is laid:
The youth that watch to-night, by me affur'4
That they obey in mine their king's command,
Seize the princess. One bold and faithful Pi&
Waits near the northern gate to give the word,
And lead them safely through the Pitifh host:
That office Durftan chose.

Duirftan!

Himself!
Wrapt in the /hades of night, alone-in arms.-

Ghosts of my kinsmen, slain that evil day
When Albion fought without her Ronan's arm.
Leave the darkmountains whereyou mouin yourfate

Euran !

Euran! whate'er the lavish Pi: has promis'd
To tempt thee to betray thy maiter's house,
Tenfold I'll give thee to preserve thy faith.
But let no man, not Kathul, Connan know:
The wrong is mine, and vengeance is my right.-
The northern gate! what is the appointed time
Of his approach ?

EU R AN.
The time that's molt remote

From the fun's riling or his setting beams,
When o'er the caitle, red Tonthena burns.-
Shall I thy fiteps attend ?

Not for the world!

The moon, the lars, the spirits of the night,
They only lhall behold the rough eyounter.

[Exit Ronan.

E U R A N.

There goes the chief whole arm in battle rules,
Whole name alone brings nations to the field.
Yet, simple as the fry, he takes the bait :
Beyond my hopes this last device succeeds.

That villain is confederate with Durftan,
To you, to me, he told the self-same tale,
And sent us forth, to ihock, and fink together,
Like vefuels in a storm.

R 0 N A N.

It must be so;

The circumstances banifl every doubt.
This is another plot of that dark brain
Whose cruel guile at firift o'erthrew my love.
Am I a beast of chace, a hanmlefs deer,
For whom the hunter plants his mortal toils,
Himself secure and safe ?

Ended her woes; her woes were not like mine,

(Tho' I dissembled to appease thee, Ronan)
Before this dreadful parley, not to live.
That Duritan knows full well.

If I escape from thee, I shall return
To him, to Ronan,' to the rightful lord
Of me and my affetions. Do not risk
By frivolous delay thy dear revenge:
Wer't thou Rfuck round with eyes on ev'ry fide,
And hung with hands to wield a thousand swords,
Yet thou might be furpriz'd: strike while thou can'st
And disappoint thy rival.-

D U R S T A N.

Tho' indeed,

I seldom do believe what women fay,
Yet, from my foul, I do believe thee now.-

This

This rage of death, this fury, this despair,
Are but the smoke and vapor of that fire,
That amorous fire which in your bosom burns.
Give it the air of hope.

R O NA N.

Curse on thy tongue:

What dost thou mean in such discourse as this,
Self-loving Durftan, to consume the time ?
Thou can'st notlcape from hence. Connan is near,
With all the youth of Elig at his fide.
E'er he arrives, once more I offer thee
The equal combat. If thou doubt'ft thine arm
Commit Rivine to her father's care,

DU-R S T A N.

Commit Rivhie to her father's care,
To Ronan's care, to her dear lover's care !
He will be tender of her and perhaps
May reconcile her to the love of life.

[Looking to the fide-fene.]

Now mighty warrior, of thy valour vain,
And truifing for success to force alone,
I have amus'd thee, till the hour is paffr
The moment of equality between us:
For tho' I deem mine arm as strong as thine,
Chance might have thrown the advantage onthy fide.
Behold

RI¥VINE.

Ha ! Euran with the Pic'ts returns.

Now let the spirit of her race inspire,
In this extreme, the daughter of the Isles.

O prince

O prince of Morven! guard thy noble life.
From ihame, from Durftan, this fihall save Rivine.

O dreadful ad ! [To Durftan.]

On thee, thou wretch accurs'd!
Author of all our woes, I'll be reveng'd

This to thy heart, and this-down to the ground.

[As Durtanfalls, Euran enters with the Pists,

and receives him in his arms.]

Thou haft it too. I leave thee to enjoy
Thy conquest and thy love.

Hence: Connan comes,

[Ihey bear him off.]

He's dead-Difhonour reft upon his name,
My love! my love !--How could'st thou ?--But'tid

done.--
I shall not long survive thee, that's my comfort.-

RIVINE.

0 that's the torture which I cannot bear,
I was prepar'd for death, but not for thine,
For me there was no refuge but the tomb:
With thee I could not, nor without thee, ive.

R O N A N.

0 do not speak so tenderly, nor look
With such heart-piercing eyes

. RIVINNE.

R. I V I N E.

I had one hope

On which I lean'd, now I am all despair.
I thought (when I was dead) that from the cloud
Of grief, my hero would break, forth again:
And run his course of glory and of fame.-
But thou art fnatch'd away, I have undone thee,
Blasted thy youth, cut ihort thy noble life,
This is the fruit that thou haft gather'd, Ronan!
The only fruit ofcurft Rivine's love.

R 0 N A N.

0! I could speak such things, but not to thee,
Whose generous heart, regardless of thyself,
Amidst despair and death for Ronan mourns.-
'Tis not thy fault. Fortune has crofs'd our love,
But I would rather bi what now I am,
Than love thee kss, or yet be less belov'do

R I V I N E.
Belov'd thou art. I die, give me thy hand. -

RONAN.

Flow fast my blood-why doll thou linger, death ?
My heart is torn with agonizing thoughts.

And give my moments to a softer sorrow.-
Caught in an eddy, up and down the ltream

I drive and wheeling to one point return.
That monster there! that villain! land of ghosts!
Shall I forget it there ?. [Dies.

Alas! my lord!
Too true the traitor's words.

Enter C O N N A N with his warriors.

CONNAN.

Oh! Ronan! Ronan!

O ! my ill-fated sifter! love of thee.
Brought down the tow'ring eagle of the war,
From his high rock of fame. Let me not blame,
Pity forbid that I ihould blame the dust
Of poor Rivine--Bear the bodies hence,
Let not old Kathul fee his daughter's blood:-
I left hit fianding by the corse of Euran.
O'erwhelm'd and dumb with grief.--

KATHUL.

I am the cause

Of all that has befallen. Thy father's steps
Turn to his hall no more: deaf is mine ear
For ever to the voice of youth and joy.
Orellan's lonely cave shall hide my grief.
There will we dwell together and decay
Like two old trees, whose roots hang uppermost
On fomebaremountain's fide, fromwhich each ftorra
Wafteth a portion of the mould'ring foil
'Till down they fall.

I am refolv'd.:.

To thee, my son, the sceptre I resign ;
I trust 'twill prosper in thy fledfaft hand.
Thou wilt not liften to the tale of lies,
Nor in rafi mood forsake thine anrient friends.
Oh! friend ofRonan! be the peoples friend.
Still let thy open gate receive the stranger,
Who from the hill or from the ship descends,
So shall thy name like grateful odour spread
From thy own dwelling to far distant lands.
I have no other wish. My son farewel!

[Exit Kathul.

C 0 N N A N.

To-morrow we a monument mall raise
To mark the place where mighty Ronan refts
With fair Rivine, in the house of death.
If right my foul forbodes they shall not lie
In dark oblivion; on their buried woes
The light refulgent of the song mnall rife
And brighten the fad tale to future times.
The brave, the fair mall give the pleating tear
Of nature, partial to the woes of love.

# EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.

Written by Mr. GARRICK.
Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.

[Enters in a Hurry.]
F ORGIVE my'coming thus, our griefs to utter-

I'm Tuch a figure !-andin such aflutter-

So circumftanc'd, in such an aukward way,
I bknow not what to do, or what to fay.

Our bard, a strange unfashionable creature,

As obstinate, as savage in his nature,
Will have no Epilogue !-I told the brute- .
If Sir, these trifles don't your genius suit;
We have a working Prologue-fmith, within,
Will strike one off, as if it were a pin.
Nay, Epilogues are Pins,-whofe points, well-plac'd,
Will trick your Muse out, in the tip-top taste !

Pins, madam! (frown'd theBard) the Greeks us'dnone,

"(Thenmutt'ringGreek--fomethinglikethis,--wenton)
" Pinnos, pointon, patcheros, non Grac Alodon."
I coax'd, he fwvore-" That tie him to a flake,
" He'd susser all for Decency's fair fake;
"No Bribery ihould make him change his plan."
There's an odd mortal. Match him if you can.
IHlahl, fir! (said I)-your reafoningis not deep,
For when at Tragedies fpelators weep,
* They oft, li:e childr,';, cry them/elves asleep.
And if nojogging Epilogue you write,
dIit, Box, and Gallery, may sleep all night:
( Better (he fwore)-a nap ihould overtake ye,
" Than Folly should to Folly's pranks awake ye;
" Rakes are more harmless nodding upon benches,
" Than ogling to infiare poor simple wenches;

, Likle harmless infan'smourn tlihemflves asleep. ALzx,

" And

s1 And imple girls had better close their eyes,
" Than fend 'em gadding after buttrties.
"Nay, flihould a fthtefinan makeabo his nest;
, Who, that his country loves, would break his reft?
"- Let come what may, I will not iuake'em laugh,
,' Take for an Epilogue-This Epitaph.
" For as my lovers lives, I would not five,
" No pois'nous weeds shall root upon their grave."
'Tis thus these pedant Greek-read poets vapour-
Is it your pleaifure I flihould read the paper ?.

Here, in the arms of deatb, a matcdlefs pair,

_ycucng-lwo'd here, and beloved fair,
Now find repofe.--lThir virtues tcmpef-toft,
Sea-fi,. and weary, reach the wuih'd-for coafi.
#beatever mortal to thisf/pot is brought
0 may the living by the dead be taught !
May here .bition learn to clip her wing,
And jealou/y to blunt her deadlyJling;
Then jhall the Poet every wijb obtain,
Nr Ronan and Rivile die in vaie
