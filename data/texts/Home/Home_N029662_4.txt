# PREFACE.

PR Ih FA i~C E.

H E faccefs of a Dramatic piece on the

Stage, depends, says Voltaire, upon accidenta:
cir-cumflances, but thie day of publication de-
cides its fate.

Persu~aded of the truth1 of this remark, the

Author of the Tragedy of Alfred would have
fubm~iitted his performncect to the final jud~g-
ment of the Rea~der, witihoult preface or apo-
10gy, if he h~ad not been advised, and indeed
ulrged, to t~:in:1 a reply to so~me hoffile critii
cifins, which appear to hav~e been founded upon
prejudice and opinion, rather than reason and
argument,

It has been alledged, that the chararfter ofi

Alfred, in the Tragoedy, does not agree with
the charafter of Alfred in Hiffory: cc That
*c the Hlero, the Legillator, is degraded to a
c· Lover, who enters rthe D~anish camp, fi~ro
lea private, not a public, motive, and aats the
**C part of an impostor.

In Tragedy, if the subject be Hiflorical, an

author is not permitted to introduce events,
contrary to the great est~ablished faats of His-
tory; for inflance, in the Tragedy of Alfred,
the H~ero must not be killted, nor driven out of
Englan~d by the Danes 3 but prefervingo those
ancient fouxndations, as the piers of his bridge,
the Author may bend his arches, and finiih the
fabrick, according: to his tasse and fancy, for
the poet is at liberty, and it is the essence of his
art, to invent such intermnediate circumilances,
and incidents, as he thinks will produce the
most affe~ing situations. In this department,

the Poet's fancy is controuled by nothing,
but probability and consistence of charader,
the barriers of dramatic truth. Let us apply-
this principle to the point in. dispute,

Alfred was a young man, wlhen he fought

the battle of Ethendone. The viatory which
ga~ve him paffeffion of the kingdom, muf1
have been gained before he begun to model
the slate, Is it impro~bable to f~uppole, that
a young hero wvas in love ? Is it inconfiflent
to repres~ent the person, wIho was a Legislator,
when advanced in years, as a lover in hris
youth! Does it degrad'e the charadler of a hero
to suppose~, that he was in love with the
princess, whom he afterwards married ? Is it
not rathaer injurious to his heroifin to clon-
clude, that he chose a consort whom he did
not love ?If this reasoning is just, there will
be no difficulty in vindicating the subs~equent
conduB of the hero. The d~ramatic and th~e
real Alfred, are both involved in the charge of

impof-

Sviii

imposture; both enter the Daniilh camp in dithL
guise s the previous Cievets, as narra;lted in the
tragedyj are nearly the f~ame with thlofe mlen-
tioned in hifteory. Alfred, for almoffi two
years, had wlandered thro' England, conceal-
ing hims~elf under feigned names and charac-
ters. He lived in the midst of his enemies,
by being$ thppofed to be dead. Emerging from
this obs~curity, he appears in the tragedy, and
is informed of the alarming, ambiguous sit~u-
ation of Ethelfwida 3 his ufuial firatagems pre-
sent themselves, one would think, naturally to
his mind, extremely agitated, and prone both
by temper and habit, to the most daring and
romantic enterprizes. H--e refalves to enter the
Danifhr camp, to learn the fate of Ethelfwida,
and observe the firength and order of the ene-
my'ss army, before hie ventures a daecifive en-o
gagement.

PThe

( ix )

The continued artifice is inevitable. The:

conidua of Alfred, in the camp of Hinguar;
trhe manner in which he deceives the Dane,
is extremely similar to the condua of Orefies
in the Elerar of Sophocles, which no critic
hithertto has blamed. Orefles enters the pa-
lace ofl~gifthus, as the meiFenger of his own
deathi, carrying an urn, which contains (he
says) the ashes of Orefies, whose untimely fate
he most circumfkantially relates. The Gre-
cian hero pradtifes th~e deceit with an inten-
tion to krill the persons whom he deceives.
The English hero deceives Hinguar only to
gain access to Ethelfwrida, with~out meaning
to hurt the person of his enemy. TSo praiie
Sophocles, and blame the author of Alfred,
for the i&me condue~, ~seems a direat contra-
dialon, whichi can only be acco~unted for in
one way; I n imaginary idea has been formed
of the charatler of Alfred as an old mortified,
ascetic sage, of [pirit too fublimne, and aetherial
to delcend to human pafflons or human ac-

a txons.

tions. But thbe real as wtell as the dr~amatic
Alfred was a young hero, a bard, a winner of
battles, brave and magnanimous, but· compel-
led by the preffhre of those derperate times, in
which he lived, to praftife a thous~and arts,
to exiA by simulation and difimulation.-
Whoever recolleas and weighs there circum-
Aances, will it is prefluned readily pardon the
artifice of Alfred in the Tragedy, and ac-
knowvledge that the fainead incidents oss the
piece are altogether confiffent· with thle true.
If not the authat must Pe contented to labour
under the imputation of anl erroneous judg-r

he was tempted to seize his narne, and display
his charadter in new situations conneaed with
the old and well known evrents of his life and
fortune. Th'e play is printed as it was per-
formed. An Alteration has been rnade, in one
[cene, and sent to the Theatre, which, If the
Tragedy ilhould be resumed or revived, may
perhaps, contribute to heighten its effe&.,

When faithless Hingua~r,: with his host, advanc'd;

The Kingr, diltradked ~for hi~s lovely bride,
Sent offa hundred Knights, by Surrey led,
To guard the princess to a place of safety :

Then;

T'hen, furious, fac'd the Dahe s-with odds oppreft,
Around their King, his faithful nobles fell~.
Alfred, by favour of the night, efcap'd,
And wander'd long, obscure, frm place to place,
Thro' woods and fortRs, like some beast of prey,
By cruel hunters cha~c'd. Much he endur'd a
And much his peoplle fuffer'd. English virtue,
Like England's oak, grew firmer from the flormz.
Often the peasa~nt his last modfel brought
To the dark wood or cave, where Alfred lay;
I~fqueftion'd by the Dane, denied the deed;
.And died, undaunteed, to preserve his prince.

~Even when he haid a place of refuge found ;
WVhere the deep winding fireams, P-arret and Th~one
Their waters mix, a litdle lifand lies,
WTith alders ov~ergrown. No name it had,
T~ho' now the name of Athelney i~t bears..
10arthes and pools, by inundation form'd,
Perplex the dire approach. There Alfred fix'd
His dreary habitatton. Two brave knights
At first were all his train. Day after day
The numbers grew s and many a gallant knight,
Found out the wild asylum of his Lord.
From thence, wi~th inroads fierce, they gall'd the Dane.
Dark as the f~piris of~ the night they came,
And vanifh'd at the dawn. In that retreat,
The f~un, thro' every fig, o'r Alfred roll'd.
