An 4dJrefs fr'ni DVID H'MlE, Efq; .4Author of bhe

Hi/lory of Great-lWitain, &c. to the Rev, .Mi-.
Ho M E, Autllor of Do u C LAS, a Tragcly.

My dear Sir,

T was the Practice of the Antients to address their
CoMipofition. on!)' to Friends and Equals, and to

render their Dedications M numents of Regard and
Affction, not of Servility and Flattery. In thole Days
of ingenious and candid Liberty, a Dedication did
Honour to the P'erson to whom it was addressed, with-
out degrading the Author. If any Partiality appeared
towa ds the Patron, it was at leall the Partiality of
Friendflhip and At'rcdion.

Another Instance oftrue Liberty, of which antient

Times can alone afford us an Example, is the Liberty
of Thought, which engaged Men of Letters, however
different in their abltract Opinions, to maintain a mutu-
al Friendllhip and Regard; and never to quarrel about
Principles, while they agreed in Inclinations and Man-
ners. Science was often the Subject of Disputation,
never of Animosity Cicero, an Academic, nddrelfed
lis philosophical Trcatifes, sometimes to Brutus, a
Stoic ; sometimes to Atticus, an Epicurean.

I have been seized vith a fllong D:fire of renewing

thiee laudable Practices of Antiquity, by addrtcling the
following Difuelrttions to you, my good FIriend: For
luch I will ever call ard elleeni you, notwitliftanding
the Oppulition ll hch 1prevails between us, with Rce-
gard to many of our I'.ccuiative Tenets. There Dilfc-
rences of Opinion I have only found to enliven our
Convcrlation ; while our coimnion Pallion tor Science
and Letters served as a Cc nent to our Friend(nlp.
Ilill admilled your Genius, even when I imagined thal
you lay under the Influence of Prejudice; and yout
1omelctinies told ime, that you txcufed my Errors, on

A 2 Account

( 4 )

Account of the Candour and Sincerity, which you
thought accompanied them.

But to tell T uth, it is less my Admiration of your

fine (Genus, which has engaged me to make this
Addrels to you, than my Efteeni of your Charater and
my \tfti.ion to your Person. Thar Generosity of
Mind which ever accompanies you ; rhat Cordiality of
Friendlhip; that fpihited Honour and Integrity, have
long interested me ftronglv in your Behalf, and have
Ir.nde me desirous, that a Mo(o:iument of our Inutunl
Amrity should he publickly erected, and, ifpollible, be
preserved to Posterity.

I own too, that I have the Ambition to be the fiil

who mall in public express his \Ad;liration ofynur nol,le
Tragedy of Douglas ; one of the niofl interclling and
pathetic Pieces, that was ever exhibited on any i hv . 1re.

In the Year '137, the Lcg;1latuic, in their great
VWifdoni, did, by an A. ot the inth of Gcor.: II.
enad and declare. " That everv Person who Ihould,
" for Hire or Reward, act, or cnule to be acted, any
" Plav, or other Enteiia'niicnt of the Stage, x ithout
"the special I.icence and Authority n:nltioned in the
" faidl \t, should be deemed a Rogue and a V\aga-
" ond, and for every such Offence Ihall forfeit the
" Sum of qn 1. S!erling."

At that '1 i:ne a Proee:t v.is let on Foot to obtain a

licensed Theatre in this City ; but the Mlaftes and Pro-
fiflcrs of the L:,iverfily, lupror'ed by the elagittrates,
having prparared a Petition, Ictri-g iolrh the drigerous
'en'ency of a P'!yhoulf here, with recpect to the
important Interc'tl of Viitue and Learning, the Pro-
jtee was laid alide.

1 lie Players, however, being so audacious as to

continue to adt in Deiance of the Law, the Presbytery
did, at their own Charge, prosecute them before the
Court of Scilions: and prevailed in the Process. The
Players were lined in Terms of I.aw ; and Warrants
being ilfued for apprehending them, they fled from
luflice. But, others came in their Place; who since
that Time have attenpted to elude the Law, by
chaniginl :le Namie of the Pi. A HoUSE into that of

Stage-Plav, iitltetll, T!e 'T-rae.jy of Douiglu,and got
it to be acted ontlhe Theatre at Fdin!nurgh ; and that
hic, with il.'veral othe, Ministers of this Church, were
p'cfent, and oime of them oftner than once, at the
arting of the said Play before a nunerous Audience:
Ihe Picfbytery being deeply affeltcd with this new
and firange Appearance, think it their Duty to declare,
as they hereby do, that they agree with the Presbytery
o1' Edinburgh in their Sentiments with refpet to Stage-
I'lavs; and particularly that such Entertainments, from
Â·what has been usually exhibited in them, and also
foin the dilTolute Lives (for the most part) and infa-
nous Characters of the Players, have been looked up-
on by the Chrillian Church in all ages, and of all dif
ferent Cominunions, as extremely prejuu:icial to Reli-
gion anl Morality. rs wetll as hurtlul to the other va-
luable lI.it;efL o(i' Ii uliln Suciety, by tlie wasteful Ex-
pencp o,' Mloney and 'ime they have occasioned! and
bcei;g convinced by long Experience, a sure Test of
the Tendency of any AAtion or Practice, how vain it
is to expect such a Reformation of the Stage as is con-
fifent with the Ends aforesaid; and therefore such
Lntertainments should de discouraged and laid aside:
And the Prelbytery fuither confidering, that the un-
precedented Countenance given to the Play-house, in
the Instance mentioned, is greatly aggravated by a
\ate AC of Parliamnent, rendering the Stage (because
not licenced) unlawful in Scotland, and alto from the
prelent Circuiiftances oi the Nation with regard to
the \'ar we are engaged in, the Dearth ofProvifions,
and the awful Tokens of the Divine Anger against us:
Thcy therefore hereby appoint and inftrul Ifuch of
their Mhltimbers as shall reprcfent them in the enftuing
general Aireinbly of this Church, to move and infill
in a regular Manner, that tie venerable Aflcinbly do
declare, by a publick Acd, their Judglment and that of
this Nn'ional Churcl, againift the Entertainments ot
the Theatre, as of very hultlul ''endency to the In-
terells ofl eligion and bociety. 2dly,'I'hat the Affemn-
LIlv do Ifrictly enquilc whether the Fads above men-
tioned, viz. that a Minitler ofthis Church ha3 com-

poled

( lo )

posed and procured to be acted on the Theatre of the
Canolngate of Edinburgh, the Tragedy called Douglas,
and that the Repre(entation of the said Tragedy was
artcnded by him anil ;;veral other Mlinilters, have
been under the Conticleration of the Presbyters relpec-
tivecv concerned ; and whatever thele Ministers, hav-
ing bccn found guiltv, have been censured as their
Fatlt'- dclfcrved ; and to give such Dirctions as thev
in their \i!;lu ionfl.1 il find neccifrry, that such iini-
fter: and ail otlicis may be lenfii)le that the Chumch
ot Scotl ;nl will never protect her Miemhbes in a Prac-
tice lb unhecoming their Character, and of Iuch per-
niciolis Tende'.-y to the great Interests ol Religion,
Indullry and Vi tue. And latllv, that the Assembly
would use their best Endeavours to obtain such an
Explication a -.d E;-forcement of the Ad of the 17th

ble to the pitiful Evasions by which it is now eluded.

Lord Ran. Again there weeds of woe ! fay, do'st thou

well

To feed a palfion which consumes thy life ?
'1he living claim fonie duty ; vainly thou
Betcow'tt thy cares upon the silent dead.

Lady Ran. Silent, alas ! is he for whom I mourn:

Childless, without niimeorial of his name,
He on!y now in my remembrance lives.

Lord Ran. Time, that wears out the trace ofdeepefl

anguish,

Has pad o'erthee in vain. Wou'd thou wer't not
Compos'd of grief and terdernefs alone!
Sure thou art not the daughter of Sir M/IA r.c o M :
Strong was his rage, eternal his resentment:
For when thy brother fell, he finil'd to hear
That DOUGLAS' son in the fame field was slain.

Lady Ran. Oh ! rake notup the alhes of my father:

Implacable resentment was their crime,
And grievous has the expiation been.
Contending with the DoUGLAS, gallant lives
Of either house were loft; my anceflors
Coinpell'd, at last, to leave their ancient feat
On Tiviot's plealant banks; and now, of then
No heir is left. Had they not been To tern,
I had not been the last of all my race.

Lo d Ran.Thy griefwrefts to its purposes my words.

I never ask'd of thee that ardent love,
\hich in the breadls of fancy's children burns.
Decent affection, and complacent kindness
Were all I willh'd for; but I wilh'd in vain.
Hence with the less regret my eyes behold
The llorm of war that gathers o'er this land:
It' I hould perish by the Danifl sword,
MAlrTI i.i), would not shed one 'I'ear the more.

Ladv Ran. Thou do'lt not think so: weful as T am

I love thy merit, and eftecm tly viltucs.
But whither gocft thou now ? Lord

Lord Ran. Straight to the camp,
htre every warrior on the tip-toe lands

Of cxpetlation, and impatient alks
Each who arrives, if he is come to tell
The Danes are lan- ed.

Lady Ran. 0, may adverse winds,

Far from the coalc ot Scotland, diive their fleet!
And every foldierof both hosts return
In peace and safety to his plealant home!

Lord Ran.Thou Ipeak'tl a woman's, hear a warrior's

wihl :

Right from their native land, the stormy north,
May the wind blow, till every keel is six'd
Imnmoveable in Caledonia's itrand !
Then lhall our foes repent their bold invasion,
And roving armies shun the fatal shore

Lady Ran. War I detest: but war with foreign foes,

Whose manners, language, and whose looks are trange,
Is not lo hoirid, nor to me to hateful,
As ;h. t wlhich with our neighbours oft we wage.
A river here, there an ideal line
By fancy diawn, divides the filler kingdoms.
On each fide dwells a people similar,
As twins ae to each other, valiant both,
Both for their valour famous thro' the world;
Yet will they not unite their kindred arms,
And, if they mull have war, mngte dillant war,
But with each other tight in cruel conflict.
Gallant in ilrilf, anid noble in their ire,
The battle ij their pallime. 'They go forth
Gay in the morning, as to uiiiiiier port:
\\ hen cv'ning comies the glory of the miorn,
The youthiiil warrior is a clod of clay.
Thus t:ll the priie of either haplcis land;
And ficih the iruit of Scotch and [ nglilfh wars.

Forgive me, lady: humble tho' 1 am,

So fervently I love you, that to dry
These pieous tears, I'd throw my life away.

Lady Ran. What power direted thy unconscious

tongue
To speak as thou haft done ? to name-

Anna. I know not:

But since my wo:is have made my nmftrefs tremble,

Lady Ran. No, thou (halt not be silent.

But what avails it? Can thy feeble pity
Roll back the flood of never ebbing time ?

Deign to unfold.

Lady Ran. Alas! an ancient feud,

Hereditary evil, was the source
Of my misfortunes Ruling fate decreed,
That my brave Brother should in battle save
'The life of Do uI LAS' son, our houfc's toe:
The youthfu! wanior vov.-'d tt;annl friendship.
To fee the vaunted fitot of his friend
Impatient, DouCLAS to Balarmo came,
Under a borrow'd naie.-lMy heart he gain'd;
Nor did 1 long refuse the hand he begg'd:
Mly brother's prelence authoriz'd our marriage.

'iThat the fadl; (ranger was lord DouGL AS' son.
Frantic with rage, the baron drew his (word
And queftion'd me. Alone, forfuken, faint,
Kneeling beneath his sword, falt'ring I took

Lady Ran. In thti firfi d iy)

B3 3f

Of my dillraRinlg grief, I found mnIfllf--
As women wilh to be who love thlir lords.
But who durlt tell my father ? The good pricll
Who join'd our hands, my brotler's ancient tutor,
VW;ith his lov'd M\ILCOI.M. in the battle fell
They two alone were privy to the marliage.
On silence and concealment I relolv'd,
Till time should make my father's fortune Inine.
That very night on which my lon was born,
My nurse, the only contident I had.
Set out with hinm to reach her lilter's hou!c:
But nurfc, nor infant, have I ever seen,
Or heard of, A .;A, since that faral hour.
My murder d child !-had thy fontl mother sear'd.
The lols of thee, the had loud fame delf'd,
Defpis'd her father's rage, her father's griet,
And wander'd with thee tiro' the scorning world.

Anna. Not seen, or heard of! then perhaps he lives.
L.ady Ran. No It was dark December: wind and rai-

Hlad beat all night. Acrols the Carron lay
The dellin'd road; and it's fvelling flood.
My faithful fervrult perilh'd with my child.
O haplcfs son ! of a inoll haplcs fire !
But they are both at reft; and I alone
Dwell in this world of woe, condemn'd to walk,
Like a guilt troubl'd ghost, my painful rounds:
Nor has despiteful fate permited me
The comfort of a solitary sorrow.
Tho' dead to love, I was compcll'd to wed
RA.noLPI, who fnatch'd me from a villain's arms;
And RAN DoL.P now poflelfes the domains,
''hat by Sir MA LCOL. X's dea'h on Ime devolv'd
Domains, that filould to D 1 ; L.\ S' son have giv'n
A baton's title, and a baron's power.
Such were mny oothing thoughts, wi. , I bcwail'd
'The laugihte'd father of a Ifn unborn.
And when that Inl came, like a ray froin heav'n,
Whichl Ilines and tilppcars ; alas ! m v chilil
How long did thy fond mother grasp the hope
Of having thee, Ihe knew not how, rct'l.r'd.
Year after year hath worn her hope away;
But left tlill undiminilb'd her dclire, .Atta.

Anna. The hand that spins th'uneven thread oflife,
May smooth the length that's yet to come of yous's

Lady Ran Not in this world: I have confider'd well

It's various evils, and on whom they fall.
Alas I how oft does goodness wound itlelf ?
And sweet affetion prove the spring of woe.
0: had I died when my lov'd husband fell!
Had Come good angel op'd to me the book
Of providence, and let me read my life,
My heart had broke, , hen 1 beheld the fum
Of ills, which one by one I have endur'd.

Anna. That God, wl:ofe minillers good angels are,

Hath shut the book in mercy to manKind.
But we mull leave this theme Â· GLEN ALVON comes:
I saw him bend on you his thoughtful eyes,
And hitherwards he llowly stalks his way.

Lady Ran. 1 will avoid him. An ungracious person

Is doublv irksome in an hour like this.
A.4nn.\Vhy speaks my lady thus of RA N DOL H'S heir ?
Lady Ran. Because he's ,ot the heir of RANDOLP 'S

virtues.

Subtle and (hrewd, he offers to mankind
An artificial image of himifelf:
And he with cafe can vary to the tafle
Of different men, it's featues. Self-denied,
And malter of his appetites he feemis:
But his fierce nature, like a fox chain'd up,
W\'achcs to lfize unleen the wih'd-tor prey.
Never were vice and vi:tue pois'd so ill,
As in GI. N A.\ UN'S unrelenting mind.
Yet is he brave and politic in war,
And lands alo;t in thele unruly times.
Why I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter:
Stay and dc;ain him till I reach the caflle.

Lord Ran. I alk'd that queRion, and he anfwer'd not:
But I mnurt know who my deliv'rer is. (to the Stranger.)

Strang. A low born nlan, of parentage obscure,

Who iluugit can boall but his desire to be
A foidier. and to gain a name in arms.

Lord Ran. \W'hoe'er thou air, thy spirit is ennobled

By the gicat King of Kings' thou art ordain'd
And ftalilpt a hero by the sovereign hand
Of nature! bult h not, flower of incdefty

S'ttiang. Mynaire isNoRVAL ; on tile Grampian hills

My latilt r teeds his flocks; a fiugal twain,
Whole conltant cares were to encreafe his store,
And keep his only son, myltelf at home.
For I hadl hard of battles, and I long'd
To tollow to the field fonie warlike lord;
And h:luven so n granted what my fire denied.
This moon which role lati night, round as mly fliild,
l-lad not yet fiil'l her horns, wlhen, by her light,
A band ot ficlce baibanians, froml the hills,
Rull'd like a torient down upon the vale,
Sueccping our flocks and herds. The flepherds fled,
For tafety, na'd for thccour. I alone,
W ith bended how, and quiver full of arrows,
Hover'd about the enemy, and niark'd
The road he took, then halted to my friends:
Wohom, with a troop of fifty cholen men,
I miet advancing. 'he pursuit I led,
Till we o'ertook the fpoil-encumber'd foe.
We fought and conquer'd. Ere a sword was drawn,
An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,
Who wore that day the arms which now I wear.
Rcturniing hi nce in triumnph, I di.dain'd
The fIhephcli's ,ll)ithfll lie ; and having heard
That our good kirlg ha I lumiinon'd his hold peers
To lead their warimors to the Carron lide,
I Iiit my iathei' houle. and took with me
A clhoten lervant to conduEt my fleps:-

And,

'Ihle happy deed that gilds my hulible name.

Obscure and friendless, he the army flught,
Bent upon peril, in the range of JIeath
Resolved to hunt for fame, and with his fIwotd
To gain dillindion which his birth denied.
In this attempt unknown he might ha e perilh'd,
And gaii'd with all his alour, but Oblivion.
Now grac'd by thee, his virtue lerves no more
Bencath dcrpair. The foldiernow of hope

Whilll thus I mus'd, a spark from fancy fell
On my fad heart, and kindled up a fondness
For this young llranger, wand'ring fron his home,

Infernal fierds, if any fiends there are
More fierce than love, ambition, and revenge,
Rife up and fill my bolomb with vour fires
And policy remoifelefs? Chance may spoil
A single aim; but perfeve:ance must
Prosper at last. For chance and fate are words:
Pcrfitlive wifdonm is the fate of man.

Like the red moon when rnfing in the east,
Crofs'd and di\ided by strange colout'd cloud;

Pursue thiflory with a faithful tongue,
To the lefi hour that thou didft keep the child.

Prif. ISar not my faith, tho' I must speak my fliame.

Within the c-adle, where the infant lay,
Wras ftow'd a mighty flore ofgold and jewels;
Tempted by which we did resolve to hide,
From all the world, this wonderful event,
And like a peasant breed the noble child.
That none might ma k the change of our estate,
\We left the country, travell'd to the north,
Rought flocks and herds, and gradually brought forth
Our i;cret wealth. Bu: God's all-feeing eye
Beheld our avarice, and fmore us fore
Jor one by one all our own children died,
And he, the stranger, sole remain'd the heir
Of what indeed was his. Fain then would I,
Who with a father's fondness lov'd the boy,
Have trusted him, now in the dawn of youth,
With his own secret: but my anxious wife,
Foreboding evil, never would consent.
Alean while the Itripling grew in years and beauty;
And, as we oft obferv'd, he bore himself,
Not as the offspring of our cottage blood;
For nature will break out: mild with the mild,
But with the froward he was fierce as fire,
And r.ight and day he talk'd of war and arms.
I set inyfelf against his warlike bent;
But all in vain: for when a defp-rate band
Of robbe;s s.on) the savage mountains came-

Lady Ran Etci n:al providence ! What is thy nme?

I am indeed the daughter of Sir MALCOLM ;
The child thou rclcu'd(t from the flood is mine.

P'i. Blest be the hour that made me a poor man!
My poverty hath fav'd my master's house !

Lady Ran. Thy words fuprize me : sure thou dost

not feign:

The tear tlands in thine eye: such love from thee
Sir MALCOLM'S house deferv'd not; if aright
Thou toldft the (lory of thy own diflrefs.

Pri. Sir MALCOLM of our barons was the flower;

The faRel friend, the bes and kindest master.
But ah ! he knew not of my fad estate.
After that battle, where his gallant son,
'Your own brave brother, fell, the good old lord
Grew defperatc and reckless of the world;
And never, as he erst was wont, went forth
To overlook the conduct of his servants.
lly them I was thrust out, and them I blame:
May heaven so judge me as I judg'd my nafer !
And God so love me as I love ias race !

Lady Ran. But whence comes this intelligence,

(;.ENALVON ?

CGkl. A nimble courier sent from yonder camp,

To haften up the chieftains of the north,
lnform'd me, as he padt, that the fierce Dane
Had on the ealtern coast of Lothian landed,
Near to that place where the fea-rock immense,
Amazing Bals, looks o'er a fertile land.

Lady Ran. Then mufl this weflern army march to

join :
The warlike troops that guard Edena's tow'rs.

Glen. Beyond all quefton. If impairing time

Has not effac'd the image of a place,
Once perfect in my breast, there is a wild
Which lyes to the westward of that mighty rock,
And seems by nature formed for the camp
Of water wafted armies, whose chief Rrength
Lies in firm foot, unflank'd with warlike horse:
If martial fill direcs the danilh lords,
There inaccessible their army lies
To our swift cow'ring hoife, the bloody field
Mull man to man, and fi,ot to foot, be fought.
Lady Ran. How many mothers flall bewail their Cons!
-How many widows weep their hulbands (lain !
Ye dames of Denmark ! cv'n for you I feel,
Who, sadly fitting on the fea-beat Ihorc,
Long look for lords that never flall return.

\Where didft thou learn to to d;lnou:! f olt tr,
And in such tcrnms, as I o'crh!ard to d iy ?
War is no viilage science, nor it's phrase
A language thaught among the ficphcrd ikvair.

Naor Sna.l is the skill my lord delighrt to praise

In him. he tavours.-Hear fioni whence it calme.
Bleneath a mountain's brow, the nicft iemote-
And inaccellfible by (hepherds trod,
In a deep cave, dug by no.mortal hand,
A lierait liv'd ; a melancholy m..n,
Who was the wonder of our v:and'ing swains.
Austere and lonely, cruel to him!eif,
Did they report hiil; the cold earth his bed,
Water his drink, h:s food the fliepherds alms.
I went to fee him, and my heart wvas tonch'd
With reverence and p.ty. iild he fpuke,
And, entring on dilco.::te, such itories toid
As nmade me oft rcvifiL his fad cell,

For

F.r i:e had been a foldicr in his vouth;
Ad.l fought in f.mclus har'l!e. * hen the peers
Of Europe, hv the bold Go I) F o led,
Again!! th' uiLtping rInidel dilplay'd
'File cro!s ot'Chrilt, and won the Hulv land.
Pltas'd with my admiration, and the fire
H{is speech struck from Ine, the old mana wnu'd Ihake
H;s years away, and a6t his young encouners:
Then, having liew'd his wounds, he'd fit him down,
And all tile live-long day discourse of war.
'I'o help my fancy, in the linooth green turf
He cut the figures of the mirfhall'd holts;
Defcrib'dthe motions, and explain'd the use
Of the deep column, and the lengthen'd line,
The Iquare, the crelcent, and the phalanx firm.
For all that Saracen, or Christian knew
Of war's vail art, was to this hermit known.

Lord Ran Why did this i,'dier in a defart hide
Those qualities, that shou'd have grac'd a camp ?

'or'v. That too at ift I learn'd. Unhappy man I

Returning homewards by NlMffina's port,
Loaded with wealth and honours bravely won,
A rude and boifl'rous captain of the sea
Faften'd a quarrel on him. Fierce they fought:
The itranger fell, and with his dying breath
Declar'd his name and lineage. Mighty God
The soldier cried, my brother ! Oh ! my brother!

Lady Ran. His brother!
'orv. Yes; of the fame parents born;

Hiis only brother. They exchang'd forgivenefis
And happy, in my mind, was he that died:
For many deaths has the survivor fuffcr'd.
In the wild defart on a rock he fits,
Or on tome nalnelefs tream's untrodden baaks,
And ruminates all day hii dreadful fate.
At riines, alas ! not in his perfect mind !
Holds dialogues with his lov'd brothet's ghoR ;
And of each night forsakes his fillen cou.h,
To make fad orisons for him he flew.

Lady. Ran. To what myftcrious woes are mortals

In this dire tragedy were there no rore [born !
Unhappy perlonm did the parents live ?

Norv. No; they were dead: kind heav'n had

clos'd their eyes
Before their son had lhed his brother's blood.

Which oft decrees an undeserved doom!

Of all the trophies which vain mortal's boait,
By wit, by valour, or by wifdoin won,
The first and faireti, in a young maln s eye,
Is wonman's captive heart. Succefslul love
With glorious fumes intoxicates the mind ;.
And the proud conqueror in triumph moves.

Lady Ran. Sad fuar and melancholy itill divide

The empire of my breaf with hope and joy.
Now hlear what I advise.

Doug. Firit, let i:;e tell

What

What nmy the tenor of your counsel change.

lady Ran. Mvy heart forebodes some evil!
Deug. 'Tis not good----

At eve, unseen by RANDOLPH and GLENALVON,
The good old NORVAL in the grove o'er-heard
Their convcrfation oft they nimntion'd me
With dreadful threatnings; you they sometimes nam'd.
'Twas strange, they said, a wonderful difcov'ry;
And ever and anon they vow'd revenge.

Lady Ran. Defenid us, graciousGod ! we are betray'd:
They have found out the secret of thy birth;
It mull be so. That is the great discovery.
Sir MALCOLM'S heir is come to claim his own;
And they will be reveng'd. Perhaps even now,
Arm'd and prepar'd for murder, they but wait
A darker and more silent hour to break
Into the chamber where they think thou feep'ft.
'his inmient, this, heav'n hath ordaiiid to save thee!
Fly to the camp, my Ion I

Do:ug. And leave you here?

No : to the castle let us go together,
Call up the ancient servants ot your house,
Who in their youth did eat your ifaher's bread.
Then tell them loudly that i am your son.
Ir in the brealts of men one spark remiains
Of sacrcd love, fidelity, or pity,
Some in your caultf will ari. I alk hbt few
To drive those I'pilcrs froml mv lather's house.

Lady. Ran. 0 naru.e, na:ure! what can check

thy force ?

Thou genuine offspring of the daring Douc LAS
But rulh not on deftfuctio:i: lave thyflcf,
And I am safe. To enc they mean no harm.
'Ihy flay lut rilks thy precious life in vain.
That winding path condlutdl rlce to the river.
Cross where thou Icell a bioad and beaten way
Which running eastward luads thee to the camp.

Shew him these jewels, which his brother v. ore.
Thy look, thy voice, will make him feel thy trutl,
Which I by certain proof will soon confirm.

Doug. I yield me and obey: but yet nly heart
Bleeds at this parting. Something bids iUe flay

And guard a mother's life. Oi't have I re.d
Of wo!,d'rous deeds by one bold arm stchu'v'd.
Our foes are two; no mnore: let mle go forth,
And fee if anv ihield can g-<ard G L ENA . ON,

Lady Ran It thou regard'Tl thy mother or rcvcr'f

Thy thther's men'ry, think of-this no more.
One thing I have to fay before we part:
I.ong wert thou loll: and thou art found, my child,
In a mont fearful fealtn. War and battle
I have great cause to dread Too well I fee
Which way the current o!- thy temper sets:
To day I've found thee. Oh ! my long loll hope!
If thou to giddy valour giv'ft the rein.
To morrow I nmay lose nmy Ton for ever.
The love of tee, le`ore thxou faw'ft the light,
Suftain'd my lite when thy brave father fell.
If thou imilt fall, I have nor love nor hope
In this wafle wvorld ! my son, remember mI !

D:ug. What lhall I fy ? how can 1 give you consort
The God of battles of my life dilpofe
As may be befl for you ! for whole dear fake
I will not bear niyfelfas I refolv'd.
Put yet confider, as no vulgar name
That which I boatl founds amongR martial men.
How will inglorious caution suit my claim ?
The pofl of fate unlhrinkl; g I maintain.
Ms ccintiry's foes miuit wituels who I am.
On the invaders heads I'll prove my birth,
'Till friends and foes conlfeci tlie genuine firain.
If in this trrife I fall, blame not )our son,
Who if he lives not honour'd, muff not live.

Lady Ran I will not utter what my bofoin feells

Too well I love that valour which I warn.
Farewel, my son ! my counsels are but vain.

Lady Ran. Behind thee! Ah; thou'rt wounded !

In low and poor obscurity I liv'd.
Lady Ran. Has heav'n prelerv'd thee for an end like

this ?

Doug. 0 had I fallen as my brave fathers fell,

Turning with fatal arm the tide of battle !
Like them I should have fiil'd and welcom'd death.
But thus to perish by a villain's hand !
Cut off fionm nature's and from glory's course,
VWhich never mortal was so fond to run.

And think life only wanting to my fame:

Doug. 0 had it pleas'd high heaven to let me live

A little while !- my eyes that gaze on thee
Grow dim apace ! my mother [Dies.

Enter Lord RANDOLPH and ANNA.
Lord Ran. Thy words, the words of truth, have

pierc'd my heart,

I am the stain of knighthood and of arms.
Oh ! if my brave deliverer survives
The traitor's fviord

Anna. Alas I look there, my lord,
Lord Ran. The mother and her son ! How curr I

am !

Was I the cause? No: I was not the cause.
Yon matchless villain did seduce my foul
To frantic jealousy.

Anna. My lady lives

The agony of grief hath but lupprea
A while her powers.

Lord Ran. But my deliverer's dead !

The world did once esteem Lord RANDOLPH well,
Sincere of heart, for spotless honour fam'd:
And, in my early days, glory I gain'd.

Beneath

BHneatli the hly banner of the cross.
Ni, pall the noon of life, shameu comes upon me;
ceproach, and iniainy, and public hire,
Arc near at hand: for all mankind wili think

Grief cannot break a heart so hard as mine.

On which omnipotence dilplays itlelt,

To awe ii's vassal, man.

Amidst thy raging gtiet I must proclaim
My innocence.

Lady Ran. Thy innocence!
Lord Ran. My guilt
Is innocence, compared with what thou think't it.

Lady Ran. Of thee I think not: what have I to do

With thee, or any thing ? My foil! my son !
My beautiful! my brave ! how proud was I
Of thee, and of thy valour ! my fond heart
O'erflow'd this day with transport, when I thought
Of growing old amidst a race of thine,
Who might make up to me their father's childhood,
And bear my brother's and my hulband's name:
Now all iuy hopes are dead! A little while
Was I a wite! a niother not so long !
What am I now - I know.- But I Ihall be
That only whillt I pleas:; tor such a son
And such a hulbanl mliake a woman bold. [Runs out.

Lord Ran. Already is the idle gnpina c-oud,

The Ipitetul vulgar, colme to gaze oni RANDOLYII.
Begone. A'irv.

A'or- I fear thee not. I will not go.

Here I'll remain. I'm an accomplice, Lord,
W\ith thee in murder. Yes, my ins did help
To crush down to the ground this lovely plant.
0 nobleftR outh that ever yet was born !
Sweetest and heft, gentlest and bravest fpiiit,
That ever blefl the world ! \rctch that I am,
Who saw that noble spirit swell and rife
Above tie nanow limits that confin'd it!
Yet never was bv all thy virtues won
To do thee juffice, and reveal thy lccrct,
Which timeiy known, had rais'd thee far above
The villain's fnnre. Oh ! I am punilh'd now !
'hefe are the hairs that hould have ftrew'd the ground,
And not the locks of DOUGLAS.

[Tears his hair, and throws him nfe uton the

ground.

Lord Ran. 1 know thee now: thy boldness Iforgive:

My crest is fallen. For thee I will appoint
A place of reft, if grief will let thee reft.
I will reward, altho' I cannot punish.
Curst, curit GLEuaALVON, he elcap'd too well,
Tho' (lain and baffled by the hand he hated.
Foaming with rage and fury to the last,
Cursing his conqueror, the felon dy'd.

Enter A N A.

Anna. My Lord, my Lord !
Lord Ran. Speak: J can hear of horror.
Anna. Horror indeed !
Lord Ran. MIIATILDA ?
Anna. Is no more:

She ran, (he flew like light'nina up the hill,
Nor halted till the prcipicr ihe gain'd,
Beneath whole low'iing top the tiver fa'r l
Ingulph'd in rifted rocks: thirher she came,
As fei'rlcfs as the eagle lightL upon it,
And heatl,,iri down

Lord Ra n. 'Twas I ! alas' 'twas I

That fill'd her Lrcalt with la'y ; drovc her dlown
''he p:ecipice of O.cath ! Wretch that 1 ain !

naa. 0 lhaid vou fecn her last despairing look!
VUon the brink Ihe flood, and calt her eyes

Djwr

Down on the deep: then lifring up her lhced
And her white hains to he:.l n, Ir..ning, toay,
Why am I forc'-d to this ? She plun ^'d hel Iitl
Into the empty air.

Lord Ran. I will not vent,

In vain complain:s, the pa:lion of my lfot!.
Peace in this world I never can enjoy.
These wounds the gratitude of R. N l)OL.P gave.
They speak aloud, and with the voice ot tate
Denounce my doom. I am retllv'l. I'li go
Straight to the battle, where the n :n that makes
Me turn aside must threaten worse than death.
Thou, faithful to thy mistress, take this ring,
Full warrant of my power. Let every rite
With cost and pomp upon their funerals wait:
For RANDOLPH hopes he never thall return.

# EPILOGUE.

EPILOGU E.

Spoken by Mr. B A R R Y.
A N Epilogue lasi'd; but not one 'word

Our bard uwill write. He 'vows'tis mofI absurd

sWith comic 'wit to contraditd the frain
Of tragedy, and make yourforrows vain.
Sadly he fays, that pity is the best,
The robhlft pafion of the humah breaf/ :
For when its sacred lreams the heart o'er-jow,
In gustes pleasure with the tide of woe ;
And when its waves retire, like those of Nile,
They leave behind them such a golden foil,
That there the 'irtues wvithout culture grow,
There the sweet blofoms of affeion blow.
Tbefi were bis words ;--oid of delufivf art
I fel them; for befloke them from his heart.
Nor will I now attempt, 'with witty filly,
Te chace away cl eflial melacholy.
