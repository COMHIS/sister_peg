AD VERTISEM E N T.
T H E author of thQ following Tragedy, has,

in his former attempts of the fame kind,

avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication
or preface. His chief reason for declining this
common mode of appearing before the public,
was the neceflity, which it would lay him under,
of speaking concerning himself and his works.
The success of Alonzo calls upon him to depart
from his former plan; and to break that silence,
which might now be reckoned arrogant, and even
ungrateful, to those, from whom he in a great
measure derives his success.

He embraces with pleasure, this occasion, to

acknowledge his obligations to THE MANAGERS of
the theatre, whose friendly, anxious, and acive
zeal he hath so often experienced: To THE PER-
FORMERS, who have so strenuously contended with
each other, in their very generous endeavours to
embellish the representation of the piece: To
MRS. BARRY-but the public voice has exalted
HER above his praise: Yet he claims the merit of

A 2 having

having, before others, observed her now allowed
and unrivalled excellency. From the colour of
the dawn, heforetold the brightness of the day.

For MRS. BARRY he wrote the part of Ormi-

finda, and the most flattering circumstance to him,
in the success of his play, is the universal opinion,
(vouched, not only by the loudest applause that
ever shook the Rage, but by the greatest efffifon

of tears) that the ACTRESS so much exalted THE
CHARACTER, that [he exceeded all imagination,
and reached the rummit of perfection.

# PROLOGUE.

PROLO GU E.

Spoken by Mr. PALME R.
r7YHIL S T ardent Zealfor India's Reformation,

Hath fired the Spirit of a generous Nation;

Whilfl Patriots of presented Lacks complain,
And Courtiers Bribery to Excess arraign;
The Maxims of Bengal iill rule the Stage,
The Poets areyour Slaves from Age to Age.
Like Eajferh Princes in this House youfit,
The Soubahs, and Nabobs offuppliant [1it;
Each Bard his Prefint brings, when he draws near,
lYith Prologue fijf, he sooths your gracious Ear;
IY'e hopeyour Clemency willhine to Day,
For tho' despotic, gentle in your Sway.
These conscious Walls if they cou'd speak wou'd tell,
How seldom byyour Doom, a Poet fell:
Your Merec oft fiJfpends the Critics Laws,
Tour Hearts are partial, to an Author's Cause.
Pleas'd with such Lords, content with our Condition,
Agaiit your Charter we will ne'er petition.
If certain Folks, jhouldfend us a Committee,
(Like that which lately vifitd the City)
JIho without fpeeial Leave of our Direc7ors,
At the Stage Door Jhou'd enter as Infpelor7s;
Altho' their Hearts were arm'd with triple Brtfi,
Thro' our re/-fing Scenes, thLy could not pass.
Lyons and Dragons too keep watch and ward,
WYitches and Ghofls the awful entrance guard ;
Heroer wlo mock the pointed Sword are here,
And desperate Hero;ne; vwho know no Fear;

If

If as Rinald'o flout each Ilan fbould prove,
To brave the Te-rcrs of the inchanted Grove,
Here on this Spot, the Center of our State,
Here on this very Spot they'd meet their Fate.
7ie Prcmpter gi'es the Sin, and down they go;
Alive descending to the Shades below.
To you whose Empire fill may Heav'n maintain,
Who here by antrent Right and CuJfom reign,
Our Lions couch, our Dragons profirate fall,
Witches and Ghs/ls cbey your pstent Call.
Our Heroines smile on ysu with all their Might,
Our boldeJf Herces tremble in yaur Sight,
Even now with anxious Hearts they watch your Eyes,
Should yiu but f.rwn, even brave ALONZO flies.

SCENE I.
A hal in the palace of the kiJngs of Saiin.

ORMISINDA. TERESA.

ORMISINDA.
X3> %'R HI S roll contains the secret of my life,

T And of the itate: My marriage with
:~.~ .Alonzo,

The tfory of my son, my injured child,
Bred in a desert, tho' the heir of Spain.
To thee, my faithful friend, my lov'd Teresa
This precious reco6d I commit. Oh! keep it
From fight of human eye, till better times:

B' For'

For till I hope that better times may comec
Tho' not to me, to this affli'ted land.
My hand hath signed it, and my a&t to day
Shall give it faith and credence with mankind,
This will explain the mystery of my fate,
And tell the world why Ormifinda died.

[Gives the writinlg.]

TERESA.
Do not too soon despair.

ORMISINDA.

I wait the last

Decisive moment. But to guard my foul
Against the sallies of a rash despair,
Against the weakness which attends surprise,
I have forecaf whatever may befall,
And fram'd to the event my firm resolve.
This is the day appointed for the combat,
Between a Moorish and a Christian knight,
To end the wars of Spain, and fix the fatz
Of the contending nations.

TERESA.

Antient times,

If tales of antient times may be believ'd,
Have known such combats. In her infant slate,
Against her rival Alba, Rome was pledg'd
As now Afturia is: But later times
Afford no parallel.

ORMISINDA.

There never was,

Nor will there ever, while the world endures,
Be found a parallel to my distress-
! am the viEtor's prize-whoe'er prevails
He gains the princess, and the crown of Spain.
Such is the solemn treaty, sworn, confirm'd,
By every rite, which either nation owns.
Mean while I am Alonzo's wedded wife-
I am a mother-by the false Alonzo,
Who from his hate to me abandons Spain,
Which he alone can save. No other arm
Can match Mirmallon's force. Proud of his strength
Already in the lifts the Moor exults,
Secure of victory. The setting fun
Concludes the dreadful period of fufpence,
And death alone from infamy can save me.

TERESA.

He yet may come. Far in the Nubian wilds,
That guard the secret sources of the Nile,
Velafco found the chief. The wind of spring,
The constant East, this year forgot its season,
And only since this moon her light renew'd,
Began to blow upon the western shore.
On that I build a hope.

ORMISINDA.

I have no hope !
Review the story of my life, Teresa,

B. 2 And

And by the past conjecaure of the future.
Fir{i my lamented brother, blindly led
By proud Ramirez, quarrell'd with Alonzo,
Then by Alonzo's sword Ramirez fell.
For that offence to banishment condemn'd,
Alonzo won me to accept his hand
Before he left this kingdom. Since that time,
What I have fuffer'd, Heav'n, and you can tell.
It was the fifth, a memorable day,
After our marriage, when he fail'd to come,
At the appointed place to meet his bride.
Then 'midst my fear, anxiety, and sorrow,
For only death I thought, or dangerous harm,
Could keep him from my arms, amaz'd I heard
That he was gone for Aria. To this hour,
Ev'n to this present hour, no cause afilgn'd
But there diftra&ed lines long after sent:
" Thou never lhalt behold Alonzo more;
" The foul, foul cause thy guilty conscience knows.'"
My conscience knows no cause, so help me Heav'n!
Now, in my utmost need, this dreadful day,
When I must struggle with despair and Death,
To keep myself a chaffe, a blameless wife,
And to my silent grave the secret bear,
That my dear son and his may live to wield
The sceptre of his fathers !

TERESA.

To this hour,
Thy husband knows not that he is a father.

ORMISINDA.

S-is ears, his eyes "are shut. Oft' have I fens
Letters, that would have'pierc'd an heart of stone;
Pleading for pity, begging but to know,
Wherein I had unwittingly offended:
But every letter, with unbroken feal,
To me return'd. He will not read one word
From my detested hand.

TERESA.

'Tis very strange,

And much unlike the way of other men.
For tho' they are inconstant in their love,
There is a course and process in the change.
Ardent at first, their ardor lasts not long.
With easy, full, secure possession cloy'd,
Their parTion palls, and cold indifference comes,
As chilly autumn fleals on summer's prime,
Making the green leaf yellow. Then it is
That some new beauty takes their roving eyes,
And fires their fancy with untafted charms.
But in a moment, from excess of love,
To the extreme of hate Alonzo pass'd
Without a cause. Nor did another come
Between thee and the current of his love.
'Tis moon-itruck madness, or the dire effe&
Of incantation, charm, compulsive spell,
By magic faften'd on his wretched foul.
It can be nothing else.

'QRMISINDA.

Whate'er it is,

He shuns all woman-kind. His life is spent
In war and in devotion. When the field
Is won, the warrior lays aside his spear,
Takes up the pilgrim's itaff, and all alone,
Obfcur'd in homely weeds, he bends his course
To some remote, religious, holy place,
Where he exceeds the strictest penitent,
In penances revere and fad austerity.
Sometimes in deeper melancholy wrapt
He loaths the fight of man, and to the cliffs
Of hoary Caucasus qr Atlas flies,
Where all the dreary winter he remains,
And, desolate, delights in desolation.
My faithful servant Juan saw him once
Upon the ledge of Atlas; on a rock
Beside the empty channel of a brook,
He flood and gaz'd intent a catara&
Which, as it tumbled from a cliff, the blast
Had caught mid-way, and froze before it fell.
Juan drew near and call'd. He turn'd about,
Look'd at him for a space, then wav'd him back,
And mounting swiftly funk behind the hill,
Wan was his face, and like a itatue pale !
His eye was wild and haggard ! Oh! Teresa,
Amidst my woes, my miseries, my wrongs!
My bosom bleeds for him !

TERESA.
Something there is

Mysterious and unfathomable here,
Which passes human wisdom to divine;
The hand of fate is on the curtain now,
Within my breast a firm persuasion dwells,
That in the lifts Alonzo will appear.
Behold in haste the king your father comes,
And seems the messenger of welcome tidings,

Enter the K I N G.

KING. ..

I come in this alarming hour, my child,
To pour a ray of comfort on thy heart.
A valiant Moor, once captive of my sword,
And ever since, my firm but secret friend,.
Acquaints me that a champion is at hand,
Shunning those honors which the Moors would pay.
Dark and referv'd he travels thro' their towns
Without a name. I judge it is Alonzo,
For the description belt accords with him..
Scorning his foes, offended with his friends,
Shrouded in anger and in deep disdain,
Like some prime planet in eclipfc he moves,
Gaz'd at and fear'l,

ORMISINDA.

It is! It is Alonzo r

Welcome, most welcome, in whatever fhajpe
The hero comes to save his native land,
To save the honor of the Chriftiau name,

And

And o'er the fading crescent of the Moo3
Exalt the holy cross.

KING.

And, ev'n as thine

Is the contenting voice of all the land.
The hope of Spain on brave Alonzo refs:.
In this I fee the ruling hand of heav'n,
Which to its own eternal purpose leads,
By winding paths, the steps of erring man !
Painful it were to speak of those events
Sad and disastrous which have laid us low.
Unjustly was Alonzo banifh'd hence,
And happily the hero now returns.
For since my son, your valiant brother, fellt
With an impartial mind I have enquir'd
And trac'd the story of Alonzo's birth.
He is the offspring of our antient kings,'
The rightful heir of Riccaredo's line;
Called the Catholic, who reign'd in Spains
Before the first invasion of the Moors.
Loft in the gen'ral wreck, buried and hid
Beneath the ruins of a fallen state,
Obscure, unknown, the royal infant lay,
When I, indignant of a foreign yoke,
In wild Afturia rose againrf the Moors.
The righteous cause prevail'd; the baffled foe
Retir'd, and left us and our mountains free.
The grateful people chose their leader king.

xI~ r~I knew

t knew rot then, nor did my people know,
Ought of Alonzo.

ORMISINDA.

I have heard him own

Thejuftice of thy title to command
And rule the fRate thy valor had reftor'd;
Enough, he said, reniain'd for him to conquer
The fertile provinces of ample Spain,
Which still the.Moor usurps.

KING.

Of all mankind,

He is the champion whom my foul desires
This day to fight for Spain and for my daughter 4
Not only for his great renown in arms,
But for his birth, his lineage, and his blood.
If his unconquer'd arm in fight prevails,
The antient monarchy shall rife again,
In all its splendor and extent of empire.
The fireams of royal blood divided now,
Shall roll a fide united thro' the land.

ORMISINDA.

Thy heart dilates with pleating hopes, my father
And fond anticipates its own desire.
But who can tell the purpose of Alonzo ?
His strange approach no friendly aspea bears:
He comes the foe determin'd of the Moors,
But not to us a friend.

C

KING.

Of that no fear;

I know him proud, impetuous, and fierce,
Haughty of heart, and high of hand: Too prompt
On all occasions to appeal to arms.
But he was ever gentle to my daughter:
The proud Alonzo bow'd the knee to thee.
At his departure I obferv'd thy grief,
And in my mind-

(A trumpet founds.)

ORMISINDA.
What means that shout of war ?

KING.
The trumpet founds to arms.

(Enter a nmefenger.)
MESSENGER.

Thy pretence, Sir,

It at the camp requir'd. Both nations arm,
And ruth to battle: Loud the Moors complain
Of violated faith. A Spanish knight
They fay has broke the treaty, and attack'd
Their bands, of peace secure.

KING.

'Tis basel done

Command m .guards to meet me at the gate.
Farewel.

[Exit the King.

TERESA.

Who can this headlong warrior be ?

Too well Alonzo knows the laws of war,
Too much reveres the treaty seal'd and sworn,
To make a rash attempt upon the Moors.

ORMISINDA.

If it is he, 'tis no deliberate aEt,
No treacherous intention to assail
The Moors unguarded. Yet it may be he:
My mind misgives me that it is Alonzo.
Ill would his swelling spirit brook the fight
Of Moorish tents and arms on yonder plain.
If as he pass'd, one fighting Word was dropt,
With tenfold scorn to that he would reply,
Nor hesitate alone to draw his sword
Amidst an host of Moors,

TERESA.

The clamor finks.

Whate'er it was, the tumult is appeas'd.
And now what does my Ormifinda think
Of my predictions ?

ORMISINDA.

Oh! my dear Teresa!

Thy fond desire to chear my hopeless heart
Makes thee forever to my mind present
The fairest fide of things.

C2

TERESA.

Ha! dost thou doubt
Still of his coming?

ORMISINDA.

No, I think 'tis he;

But hope and fear alternate sway my mind:
Like light and shade upon a waving field
Coursing each other, when the flying clouds
Now hide and now- reveal the fun of heav'n.
I tremble for the issue of the combat;
And if my Lord Thould, as I. hope, prevail,
I tremble for mnyfelf; Afraid to fee,
Tho' sick with strong impatience to behold him,
And learn why he forsook his Ormifinda.
He fays I know the cause. Oh ! molt unjust.!
Was it because I lov'd him to excess,
Altho' his title ihook my.father's throne ?
Was it because I join'd my fate to his,
And fondly chose to wed a banifh'd man ?
For such are my demerits.

TERESA.

'Tis but vain

Thus to torment thyself, and rack thy mind
With fad conjectures, at a time like this,
.When the reality will soon be known.

RM
g ISINDA.

I know one thing that's rea,. 'tis a fault,
An imperfetion which I cannot cure;

Sixteen

Sixteen long years are past since I beheld him,
And grief and care, those tenants that deface
The sac and weary mansion they inhabit,
Have dwelt with me; Am I not aker'd much ?
The ghof and shadow of what once I was ?

TERESA.

No, Ormifinda, I.perceive no change.;
That in the least impairs thy lovely form.
The beam that gilds the early morn of youth
Yields to, the splendor of. a riper hour.:
The rose that was.fo fair in bud, is blown;
And grief and care, tho' they have dwelt with:thee,
Have left no traces of their: vifitaiion,
But an impression sweet of melancholy
Which captivates the foul. Unskilful they
Who dress the queen of love in wanton finiles:
Brightest she shines amidit a fhow'r of tears;
The graces that adorn her beauty molt,
Are softness, sensibility, and pity.

ORMISINDA.

Oh ! how ingenious thou art, Teresa,
How subtle to elude my simple fears !
Still they advance and gather round my heart.
If nothing can recal Alonzo's love,
Let him but own his son, and I'll renounce
The title of his wife, and of a queen;
Then in a convent hide me and my sorrows.
The saddest sifter of the holy train,

2 Whose

Whose watchful zeal prevents the midnight bell,
Shall find me kneeling on the marble floor,
Oh ! it will be the luxury of grief,
To weep incessant in the vaulted cell,
To lift my hands, and fend my vows to heav'n,
Invoking ev'ry power that dwells above,
To guard and bless my huiband and my son!
Perhaps some friend, most likely my Teresa,
When I am quite forsaken and forgot
-By all the world, will still remember me;
Will come and tell me of Alonzo's wars;
Tell how my boy in his first battle fought,
At once the rival of his father's fame.

END OF THE FIRST ACT.

# ACT II.

ACT II.

SCENE I.
Enter the K I N G and a Moorish officer, with

Moors and Spaniards.

KING.
H AMET, impartial juflice shall be done,

' And thou I know as justly wilt report it:
-Thou art the friend of peace.

HAMET.

Therefore I fought

This office; for in yonder camp, O ! King,
Some counsellors there are who urg'd the Caliph
To take advantage of this fair occasion
And hold the treaty void.

KING.

That I believe,

But with your aid I hope to disappoint them;
My guards are gone to bring th' offender hither.

HAMET.

Yonder they come, 'and thro' their files I fee
A prisoner.

[Enter guards with a young man armed,]

KING.

a ! by Heaven, he's but a youthi

A beardless boy, and like a woman fair.
He moves my pity much. Unhappy youth!

[To the prifoncr.]

Art thou the chief of that unruly band,
WYho broke the treaty and assail'd the Moors ?

YOUTH.

No chief, no leader of a band am I.
The katfer of a band insulted me,
And those he led barely assail'd my life;
With bad success indeed. If felf-defence
Be criminal, O King.! I have offended.

KING. [To Hamnt.]

With What a n6ble confidence he speaks!
See what a spirit thro' his blushes breaks !
Observe him, Hamet.

HAMET.

I am six'd upon him,

KING. '

Didft thou alone engage a band of Moors
And make such havoc? Sure it cannot be.
Recall thy-fcattered thoughts, Nothing advance
Which proof may overthrow.

YOUTH.

What I have said

No proof can overthrow. Where is the man,
Who speaking from himself, not from reports
And rumors idle, will stand forth and fay
I was not single when the Moors attack'd me ?

HAMET.

1 will not be that man, tho' I confess,
That I came hither to accuse thee, Youth!
And to demand thy punilhment.-I brought
The tale our soldiers told.

YOUTH.

The tale was false.

HAMET.

I thought it true; but thou haft lfook my faith,
The feal of truth is on thy gallant form,
For none but cowards lie.

KING.

Thy story tell,

With every circumstance which may explain
The teeming wonder; how a single man
In such a strife could stand ?

YOUTH.

'Twill cease to be

A wonder, when thou hear'st the story told.
This morning on my road to Oviedo

D Awhile

A while I halted near a Moorish potl.
Of the commander I enquir'd my way,
And told my purpose, that I came to fee
The famous combat. With a scornful smile,
With taunting words and gestures he replied,
Mocking my youth. Advis'd me to return
Back to my father's house, and in the ring
To dance with boys and girls. He added too
That I should fee no combat. That no knight
Of Spain durst meet the champion of the Moors.
Incens'd I did indeed retort his scorn.
The quarrel grew apace, and I defied him,
To a green hill, which rose amidit the plain,
An arrow's flight or farther from his post.
Alone we sped: at once we drew, we fought.
The Moorish captain fell: Enrag'd his men
Flew to revenge his death. Secure they came
Each with his utmost speed. Those who came first
Single I met and flew. More wary grown
The reft together join'd, and all at once
Assail'd me. Then I had no hopes of life.
But suddenly a troop of Spaniards came
And charg'd my foes, who did not long sustain
The ihock, but fled, and carried to their camp
That false report which thou, 0 King! haft heard.

KING.

Now by my sceptre, and my sword, I swear,
Thou art a noble youth. An angel's voice

3 Could

d

Could not command a more implicit faith
Than thou from me haft gain'd, What think'ft

thou, Hamet ?
Is he not greatly wrong'd ?

HAMET.

By Allah! yes.

The voice of truth and innocence is bold,
And never yet could guilt that tone aflume.
I take my leave impatient to return,
.And satisfy my friends that this brave youth
Was not th' aggressor.

KING.

I expect no lets
From gen'rous Hamet.

[Exit Hamet and Moors,]

KING.

Tell me, wondrous Youth !

For much I long to know; what is thy name ?
Who are thy parents ? Since the Moor prevail'd,
The cottage and the cave have oft' conceal'd
From hostile hate the noblest blood of Spain:
Thy spirit speaks for thee. Thou art a ihoot
Of some illustrious stock, tome noble house
Whose fortunes with their falling country fell.

YOUTH.

Alberto is my name. I draw my birth
From Catalonia; in the mountains there

D2 MY

My fathe dwells, and for his own domains
Pays tribute to the Moor. He was a soldier:
Oft' I have heard him of your battles speak,
Of Cavadonga's and Olalles' field.
But ever since 1 can remember ought,
His chief employment and delight have been
To train me to the use and love of arms;
In martial exercise we pall the day;
Morning and evening, still the theme was war.
He bred me to endure the summer's heat,
And brave the winter's cold: To swim across
The headlong torrent, when the shoals of ice
Drove down the fiream. To rule the fiercest freed
That on our mountains run. No savage beast
The forest yields that I have not encounter'd.
Meanwhile my bosom beat for nobler game;
I long'd in arms to meet the foes of Spain,
Oft I implor'd my father to permit me,
Before the truce was made, to join the hofr.
He ifaid it must not be, I was too young
For the rude service of there trying times,

KING.
Did he permit you now ?

ALB-ERTO.

A :strange adventure

Forc'd me fr6m home. Nomrnany days ago,
When hunting in the woods, I heard a voice,

A woman's

A woman's voice, calling aloud for help.
I rurh'd: into the thicket; there I saw
A Moorish Lord, for brutal licence fam'd,
Who Shamefully abus'd a rural maid
Of Spanish race. I free'd her from his arms.
The Moor spake not a word, but mad with rage
Snatch'd up his lance, which stood against a tree,
And at me flew. I turndd his point aside,
And with a slender javelin pierc'd his heart.
I hasten'd home, but did'notfind my father,
Nor was it sffe to wait for his returi.
i took the faieft armour i :the -iaM,
And hither bent my sourie.: The reftthou know'tL

'KI. . . "

With thoughts profound.and expetation high.
When in a nation, humbledrlby'tthe will - -. ,
Of Providence, beneath an.haughty foe,

(Enter Messenger.)
MESSE'N-GER.

. Thehcha npion, Sir,
Who comes to fight for Spain, is-near athand:

One

One of our scouts has seen him and his train;
But brings a strange report, which damps tae heart
Of every Spaniard. It is not Alonzo.

KING.

What fay'ft thou ? God of heaven ! Not AlonzQ!
Who is he then ?

MESSENGER.
That is not fully known.

Clad in the flowing vesture of the east,
A Persian turban on his head he wears,
Yet lie's a chrittian knight. To mark his faith,
Holy, and adverse to Mohammed's law,
Before his steps a silken banner borne
Streams in the wind, and Ihews a golden cross,

KING.
Send out another scout.

MESSENGER.

There is not time
To go and to return.

KING.

Begone, begone,

And let me be obey'd. Alas! my hopes
Are vanilh'd like a dream.

ALBERTO.
I grieve to fev
The king afflied.

KING.

Ah! Thou dost not know
How deep these tidings itrike.

ALBERTO.

Is not the king

Free to accept or to refuse the aid
This stranger offers ?

KING.

If I am, what then?

ALBERTO.

Be not offended, Sir, at my presumption,
For from my heart I speak, a loyal heart,
True to 'my fov'reign and my native land.
If this is not Alonzo, why ihould he,
Or any stranger fight the cause of Spain ?
Are there not warriors born of Spanish race,
Who court the combat ?

KING.

To my words attend.

The Moorish champion is of great renown;
In stature like the giant race of old,
Like Anak's true, or Titan's fabled sons.
Againrf the foe nor sword nor spear he lifts,
But in his might secure, a mace he wields,
Whose sway resistless breaks both shield and arm,
And crushes head and helmet. Thus he fights,

Whose

Whose fatal prowess turn'd the doubtful scale
Of three successive battles. He is deem'd
Invincible but by Alonzo's arm:
Therefore our warriors, tho' they know no fear,
No fear of ought that can themselves befal,
Anxious for Spain, to great Alonzo yield,
And on his valour reft.

ALBERTO.

Oft' have I heard

My father speak of brave Alonzo's deeds;
What can with-hold him when his country calls ?
Perhaps the last of combats he has fought,
And in the silent tomb the hero relts.
But, since he's absent, from whatever cause,
O ! let no stranger knight his place alume,
To bring dishonour on the Spanish name.
If this gigantic champion of the Moors,
Clad in the glory of his battles won,
Dazzles the warriors, and confounds their valour
Let me, tho' young in arms, the combat claim,
On me his fame has no impression made.
I'll meet the giant with a fearless heart.
It beats for battle now. Oft have I kil'd
The wolf, the boar, and the wild mountain bull,
For sport and pastime. Shall this Moorilh dog
Resist me fighting in my country's cause ?

KING.
By heaven and earth, thou mov'ft me much! thy

words

Have stirr'd the embers of my youthful fire.
Thou mak'ft me wiflh I could recal those days,
Whl.n of an age like thine, and not unlike
To thee in face and form, I rais'd the spear
Againfi -he Moor, in Cava's bloody field.
Then by my hand the great Alchammon fell,
The ftrenl-h and pillar of the Caliph's host.
Then ! .'vas fit to meet Mirmallon's arm.
Eut now, my hairs are grey, my steps are flov,
My sword descending breaks the ihield no more:
Our foes have known it long.

ALBERTO.

O! King, thou art

Thy country's great deliv'rer, and the sole
Restorer of the state. Pelagio's fame
Shall never die: But let thy counsel now
(As oft thy valour) save this land from ihame,
Let not a foreign warrior take the field,
And snatch the glory from the lance of Spain.

KING.

My voice alone cannot determine that,
The council fit assembled near the lifts,
To them I will prefeht thee. If this knight
Unknown, who from that diftait region comes,'
Where the bright fun lights up his golden lamp,
Bears not some high pre-eminence about him,

E Which

Which marks him out our surest safest choice,
My voice is'for a Spaniard, and for thee!

ALBERTO.

Upon my knees, that ne'er were bow'd before
To mortal man, I thank thee!

KING.

Rife, Alberto!

To me no thanks are due. A greater King,
The King of Kings, I deem hath chosen thee
To be the champion of his law divine
Against the Infidel.-If not for this,
For some great purpose sure thou art ordain'd.
Bred in the desert, and by heav'n endued
With force and valor marvellously great,
Conduaed by a hand unseen, thyself
Not knowing whither, and this day produc'd
Before the nations.

ALBERTO.

Ah ! my foul's on fire!

Should such a glorious destiny be mine!
May I intreat to go without delay ?
I fear some gallant warrior may ftep forth
And claim the fight before me.

KING.

Stay, Sebastian,
And to my daughter tell what has befall'n.

[Exeunt King and Alberto.

(Manet SE BAST AN.)

How many changes mark this awful day !
What must the Princess uffer ! Well I know
That she above all others with'd Alonzo.

Enter ORMISINDA and TERESA.

TERESA.

It is a false report. In times like these
The minds of men are credulous and weak:
To rumor's shifting blast they bow and bend,
Like corn of slender reed to every wind:
Thou know'it that from the East Alonzo comes.
Might not the hasty messenger mistake
For him some turban'd warrior of his train ?

ORMISINDA.

O! good Sebastian, canst thou tell me ought?
Is it Alonzo?

SEBASTIAN.

If report speaks truth,
And so the King believes, 'tis not Alonzo.

ORMISINDA.
Then I am loft, Teresa.

TERESA.

Haft thou heard,
If not Alonzo, who this itranger is?

SEBASTIAN.

His garb bespeaks him native of the East.
But from whatever clime the warrior comes,

E 2 I hope,

I hope, my Princess! that he comes in vain.
Another warrior, and of Spanili race,
Now claims the combat for his native land.

ORMISINDA.
Of Spanilh race! Who is this Knight of Spain ?

SEBASTIAN.

A wonder! never was his equal seen,
For daring valour and address in arms.
He has not yet attain'd the prime of youth,
His look partakes more of the boy than man,
But he hath vanquifh'd men. This day the Moors
Have felt his hand.

ORMISINDA.

Ha! Is it he, Sebastian,
Who was the author of the late alarm ?

SEBASTIAN.
The fame.

ORMISINDA.
And whence does this young hero come ?

SEBASTIAN.

From Catalonia. In the deserts there
His fire, obscure, tho' once a warrior, dwells.

ORMISINDA.

From Catalonia! In the desert bred!
Teresa! All that's pofible I fear:
What if this youth-

TERES A. [rT Ormifwda.]

! think how many youths

Of Spanilh race in Catalonia dwell.
Be recollected whilst I alk Sebaflian
A question that at once all doubt resolves.

[To Sehafliau.]

Has this youth no name? Haft thou not heard
How he is call'd?

SEBASTIAN.

He calls himself Alberto.

ORMISINDA.
Mother of God!

TERESA. [ToHcr.]

Beware !-- The Princess grieves,

[Co Sebaflia.]

That Spain depriv'd of great Alonzo's aid,
Should reft her safety on a stripling's arm.

ORMISINDA.

No judge of warriors or of combats I;
But sure this youth, tho' ne'er so brave and bold,
Of tender years, who has not reach'd his prime,
Is most unfit to cope with strong Mirmallon.

SEBASTIAN.

Heroes muf not bejudg'd by common rules.
Irregular like comets in their course,
Who can compute the period when they shine ?
Lady! If thou had'st seen this gallant youth,
If thou had'st heard him, when oblig'd to speak,

In

In felf-defence, he told his wond'rous deeds,
As if he thought them nothing: Thy faint heart
Would from his fire have caught the flame of hope,
Thou would'tt, even as thy royal father did,
Believe he was created and ordain'd,
By Heav'n supreme, the champion of his country.

TERESA.

Sebastian, go, and find this gallant youth.
Tell him, the Princess, partial to the brave,
Desires his presence.

SEBASTIAN.

Gladly I obey.
[Exit SEBASTIAN.]

ORMISINDA.

He's gone. Now I may speak. Mys on! my son!
My hope, my comfort, in despair and death!
The only star in my dark PKy that ihone!
Must thy unhappy mother live to fee
Thy light extinguifh'd ? I will not permit
This most unequal combat. I'll proclaim
My fatal story, and declare his birth.

TERESA.
Think what must follow. Absolute perdition!

ORMISINDA.

Is not his death perdition ? Can he meet
The Moor and live ? How should his tender youth
Resist the giant, who has overthrown

3 Squadrons

Squadrons entire, and trampled on the necks
Of firmest warriors ?

TERESA.

'Tis not yet decreed

That he Ihall fight the Moor. The firanger knight,
Who was at first mistaken for Alonzo,
Comes not so far, without a name in arms,
To gain the suffrage of the Peers of Spain,
When once that name is known.

ORMISIND A.

Teresa, no.

My fate -has still one even tenor held,
From bad to worse. When I had fram'd my mind
To one dilafter, then a greater came.
I had made death familiar to my thoughts;
I could embrace the fpecrre like a friend:
But still I kept a corner of my heart
Safe and untouch'd. My dearest child was there:
Amidst the ruins of the wife and queen,
The mother flood secure. O thou Alonzo !
If yet thine eyes behold the light of day,
What sorrow and remorse must be thy portion,
When thou shalt hear-Now promise me, Teresa,
That when my son and I are laid in dust,
'For each event accelerates our doom)
Thou wilt seek out and find this cruel man.
Tell him how Spain, the kingdom of his fathers,
By him deserted, was for ever loft:

How

How his forsaken wife in honour died-
But that's not much-for me he will not mourn.
T.'ren tell him of his son, to wring his heart!
1' ;- dcfcribe the boy ! how brave he was !
H'J;. :- :utifui ! how from the cloud obscure
In v.h:cL:h bi careful mother had nvolv'd him,
He burst rr-. cilhn:pion of his native land:
7'.- tell him howv the springing hero fell

- -a fironger arm, fighting for Spain,

- ::i for hi- mother; fighting with the foe
His fatter '..'&.k have fought, and could have

vanquiih'd !

TERESA.
Sebastian co.nes.

Enter SEBASTIAN.

SEBASTIAN.

All is revers'd again:

The franger knight is for Abdallah known,
The Persian prince, Alonzo's choien friend,
His only equal in the strife of arms.
To him the combat is decided.

ORMISINDA.

I know

His flory well; he is the Sophy's son,
The eldest born and Persia's rightful heir;
But by his mother's zeal a Christian bred:
True to his faith, he loft his father's throne.
WThat fays he of Alonzo ?

SEBASTIAN.

Sent by him;

The brave Abdallah comes to fight for Spain.
They march'd together, from the falls of Nile
To Damietta. There a wound receiv'd
In Asia's wars broke out, and forc'd Alonzo,
Full of regret, in Egypt to remain.
His friend for him appears. The king, thy father,
With all his peers, ii honour of the prince,
Go forth to meet him.

ORMISINDA.

Haft thou seen Alberto ?

SEBASTIAN.

I have, and told him what I had in charge;
Then hasten'd hither to report there tidings,
At which Alberto droops.

TERESA.

Return, I pray,

To my apartment guide the young Alberto.
The princess will be there. [Exit Sebastian.]

Did not I fay,

Alonzo never would abandon Spain ?
Abdallah comes to conquer in his name.
Now I can read the charaters of fate,
And spell the will of Heav'n. This boy of yours
Will win your husband back. When he beholds
The image of his valour so express,
His heart will melt. The husband and the father
Will rush upon him with a flood of joy.
* F

ORMISINDA.

Is he not like Him ? Mark his coming forth !
Behold Alonzo in his daring son !
Full of the spirt of his warlike fire,
His birth unknown, he felt his princely mind,
Advanc'd undaunted on the edge of war,
And claim'd the post of danger for his own.

TERESA.

A mother's tongue cannot exceed the truth
In praising him. There never was a prince,
Since old Iberia first excell'd in arms,
Broke out with so much lufire on mankind.
But in this interview, with prudence check
The transport of affeaion from thy foan
Cautious conceal the seeret of his birth.
Safest he is, while to himlelf unknown.

ORMISINDA.

How could his faithful guardian let him go .
Perhaps that faithful guardian lives no more.

TERESA.
Alberto wi1 inform thee.

ORMISINDA;

Not Alberto;
Alonzo is his name. I go to meet him.

SCENE I.
A view of the country near the city.

Enter ABDALLAH.
O ! CITY! once the feat of all I lov'd!

0! hills and dales ! haunts of my youtmll

days!

0! scenes well known! unalter'd you remain.
But I approach you with an alter'd mind,
Hate what I lov'd, and loath what I defir'd,
Intolerable state! My foul is void !
A chaos without form. Why, nature, why !
Art thou so watchful o'er the brutal tribes,
And yet so careless of the human race.
By certain instinct beasts and birds discern
Their proper food: For them the fairest fruit
Untouch'd, if pois'nous, withers on the bough:-
But man, by a fair outside, fill deceiv'd,
And by his boasted reason more betray'd,
Gives the affection of his foul to beauty,
Devours the deadly bane.

Enter VELASCO,

My Lord! Thy people,
Where thou commanded'ft, halt, and wait thy

coming.

F2

ABDALLAH.

'Tis well! I wisi'd to speak with thee alone,
Velafco ! tho' to thee but little known,
I did in part reveal my secret foul,
Told thee the feign'd Abdallah was Alonzo.
Further than that, thou haft not fought to know,
Tho' many a lonely hour we two have worn
On lea and shore, that some men would havethought
Most opportune,

VELASCO.

My Lord ! There are some men

Who having once been trusted with a little,
Avail themselves of that, some more to learn,
And penetrate the bosom of a friend,
Even with the wedge his uneasiness had furnih'd-
Such men lhould not be trusted,

ABDALLAH.

True, Velacc !

But thou art not like them: I have obferv'd thee,
Warm in affe&tion, but in temper cool:
A Iteady judgment guides thee thro' the world.
Thy gen'rous mind pursues the path of honour,
Unbiafi'd and unmov'd.

VELASCO.
From early youth,

The chosen confident of my companions,
I never yet from perfidy betray'd,
From babling vanity, divulg'd a secret,

ABDALLAH.

I have a tale to tell, that will amaze,
Confound, and ifrike thee dumb. The deserts vast
Of Asia and of Africa have heard it.
The rocky cliffs of Caucasus and Atlas
Have echo'd my complaints: But never yet
The human ear receiv'd them. Thou has heard
Already more than ever mortal did.
Thou know'ft the princess ?

VELASCO.

Ormifinda!
ABDALLAH.

Her.

VELASCO.

Not many of the court have been mbre honoured
With opportunities to know her .worth;
And there is none who more her worth reveres.

ABD.ALLAH.

Her worth ! Thou may'it as well revere a fiend,
The blackest fiend, that dwells in burning hell,
Is not more opposite to all that's good
Than Ormifinda.

VELASCO.

What a itrain is this ?

.ABDALLAH -

'Tis true, by every high and holy *name, .:. ' .
That binds a soldier's and a prince's vow:

I swear,

I swear, Velafco, fie's the vilest woman
That e'er difgrac'd her sex. The most abandon'd,
The hardieft, most determin'd in her vice,
That ever wrong'd a fond believing heart.

VELASCO.
Great God!

ABDALLAH.

You start and shudder like a man
Struck with a heavy blow.

VELASCO.

And so I am.

ABDALLAH.

And now you lift your eye-lids up and flare
With looks full of conjecture and suspicion,
As if you doubted of my fober mind.
I am not mad, Velafco, tho' sometimes
I have been near, yes, very near to madneti;
By that bad woman craz'd.

VELASCO.

O! Would to heav'n !

That this afflicing moment of my life
Were a delirious dream! Unreal all
That's heard and spoken now ! But how, my.Lord,
Art thou fo-much affected by her crimes ?

ABDIALLAH.
I am her husband.

VELASCO.
Heav'n for that be prais'd!

ABDALLAH.

How dar'ft thou thus profane the name of heav'ri,
And mock my misery ? Thou art mad, I think;
Thefrenzy which thou wiffed'il has come upon them
Beware, for if this extafy endures,
My sword secures thy silence.

VELASCO.

O ! forgive me,

Noble Alonzo, royal, I should fay,
Doubly my matier now. There's not a man,
Whose veins contain one drop of Spanish blood,
Who does not with thee wedded to the princess.
And for her virtue ! Thou haft long been absent,.
And know'fl not what An angel's life hfe leads 1
Referv'd, retir'd, and fad. I'll fake myfoul,
Some villain has belied thy faithful wife,
And fnar'd thy easy faith.

ABDALLAH.

Take heed, take heed!

I am the villain who accuse the princess,
And thou ihalt be her judge.

VELAS-CO.

Eternal power I
What ihould I think of this ?.

ABD ALLAH.

Liften to me.

I have perplex'd thee, and have marr'd the flory
By my abruptness. 'Tis a serious flory,
Not to be told in parcels and by starts,
As I from impotence of mind began,
But I will bear my swelling passion down,
And utter all my shame. Thou dost remember
How I was banilh'd from my native land ?

VELASCO.
For killing young Ramirez.

ABDALLAH.

At that time

I dqated on the princess. She conjur'd me
With earnest pray'rs, with deluges of tears,
Not to refift-her father, nor advance
My better title to the crown of Spain,
As I had once refolv'd. My rage she footh'd 3
Pride, anger, int'reft, yielded all to love.
With her I made a merit of obedience,
And peaded so effechually my-catfe,
Thyfbe tonfented to a private marriage,
Before I- lefrthe kingdom. We were married,
And met tg~eer, four-fuccetfive nights,
In the fequ eff-red- cbtae-boFthe-wood,
Behind the palace garden. 0! :I thought
Myself- the happiest and the most belov'd
Of all mankind. -She mock'- me all the while;

Meant
2

Meait me the cover of her loose amours
A cloak to hide her shame. 0 God! 0 God !
Did I deserve nd better?

VELASCd.

Good my Lord!

What circtlmftanhe to warrant such coriclulion i
What evidence? ,

ABDALLAH .
The evidence of fight-. -
Mine eyes beheld: I saw myself dishonourid.

VELASCO.
Your eyes beheld i

ABDALLAH.

-ty-Heav'n and Hell--they did.

The night preceding the appointed day
Of my departures from the realm of Spain,
I flew impatient to the place of meeting,
Before the hour was come. To Wear away
The tedious time, for ev'ty minute feem'i
An age to me, I frtrck into the wood
And wander'd there, still fittring to the gate
By which she was to enter. Thro' the treel
The moon full otb'd in all het glory ihone.
My am'rous mind a sportful puipofe form'dn
Unseen to watch the coming of my bride5
And waqtonly. furprize her. Near the gate
There stood an aged tree. It was a beech,
Which far and wide ftretch'd forth its level arms

G Low

Low, near the ground, and form'd a gloomy shade.
Behind it-runk I took my secret ifand;
The gate was full in view, and the green path
On which it open'd. There I flood awhile,
And soon I heard the turning of the key.
My heart beat thick withjoy-and forth ihe came:-
No: as I wish'd: She had a minion with her;
A handsome youth was tripping by her fide,
Girt with a sword, and drefs'd in gay attire.
He feem'd to court her, as they pass'd along,
Coy, but not angry, sorI heard her laugh.
She flung away. He follow'd, soon o'ertook her,
Embrac'd her-

VELASCO.
Ah! The Princess Ormifinda!

ABDALLAH.

I drew my isword, that I rememberwell,
And then an interval like death ensued.
When confciounefs return'd, I found myself
Stretch'd at my length upon the naked ground
Under the tree: My sword lay by my fide.
The sudden fhcck, the transport of my rage,
And grief, had ftopt the current of my blood,
And made a pause of life.

VEL A SCO

Alas! my Lord I

'Twas piteous indeed. What did'ft thou do,
When life and-rifife eturn'd?
.* - t-

ABDALLAH.

With life and fenl

My rage return'd. Stumbling with hafte;.I ran
To sacrifice them to my just revenge.
But whether they had heard my heavy fall,
Or that my death-like swoon had lasted long,
I know not, but I never saw them more.
I fearch'd till morning; then away I went,
Refolv'd to scorn the strumpet, and forget her.
But I have not been able to forget
Nor to despise her; tho' I hate her more
Than e'er I lov'd her, still her image haunts me
Where'er I go. I think of nothing else
When I'm awake, and never shut my eyes
But Ihe's the certain vision of -my dream.
Sometimes, in all her loveliness she comes
Without her crimes: In extafy I wake,
And wish the vision had endur'd for ever.
For there deceitful moments, 0! my friend!
Are the sole pleasant moments which AlonzQ
For eighteen years has known.

VELASCO.

Within that time,

What regions barbarous haft thou explor'd,
What strange viciffit4des of life endur'd
In action and ropofe.

ABDALLAI.

Extremes of both
4 Spurted to relieve my tartur'd mind;

O X But

But the tormenter ffill my steps attends;
Behind me kounts, when thro' the ranks of war
I drive my fiery ffeed; and when I leek
The hernnit's cell, the fiend purfies me there.
Time, which they fay the wounds of passion tcre4
In other hearts, infames and fefers mine.
There's but one remedy.

VELASCO..
Would I could name one !

ABDALLAH.

Her life. The unftion for the ferpent's-bite
Is the fell serpent's blood. I'll have her life,
Th' adulteress with infamy shall die,
By public justice doom'd. With this intent
Difguis'd I come. If in my proper shape
I had appear'd, alarm'd ihe would have fled,
And baffled my revenge,

VELASCO,

My Lord, permit me

One thing to mention, which there eyes beheld,
Altho' it squares not just with thy opinion,

ABDALLAH.
Opinion. .

VELASCO.

Good my Lord! with patience hear.

When firit I was to this employment nam'd,
Which since I have so happily difcharg'd,
The Princess sent and call'd me to her' presence.

Thp

The treaty with the Moor engrofs'd hey thoughts.
That fad and pensive air feh always wears
Was fettled to a t4icker gloom of grief.
Her voice was low and languid, Few her words
And the short periods ended with a sigh.
But when I gave her hopes of thy return,
A sudden gleam of joy spread o'er her face,
Like morning breaking in a cloudy Iky.
With earnest voice, still rising as The spoke,
She urg'd difpateh, exhorted me tq zeal
And perseverance, Never to desist
Till I had found thee: For her fate, she said,
The fate of Spain, depended an Alonzo.
Her passion then burst in a flood of tears
That chok.'d her utterance,

AB ALLAHI

And thou didft believe

That ev'ry word the spoke was most sincere.
How to int.rpret her let me ir1trudt thee.
Whate'er she utters with unusual warmth,
As the effusion genuine of her heart,
Receive and construe in another sense
Reverse and opposite; for that's the truth.
The words ihe spoke, her sighs, the tears she Ihed,
Were all from apprehension of my coming,
Not as they feem'd, for fear I fiould not come.

VELASCO.
'Tis dreadful that,

ABDALLAH.
'Tis horrible, 'tis monfirous

When I for her had way'd my right to reign,
The right urwdoubted of the'.Gothic line,
And ftoop'd, enamour'd, to that base decree
From Spain, whch banith'd the true heir of Spain,
That ihe Mbould pitch on me to be her fool,
And pour such infinite contempt upon me.
But four days married! Fond, to rpadnefs fond!
And on the very eve of my departure !
She would not for a single day refrain,
But runh'd'to prostitution!

VSLASCO.

I have heard

Stories and tales enough of female fallhood;
Some that were true, and others that were feign'd,
By spiteful wits malicouny devis'd.
But this surpasses all.

ABDALLAH.

All wicked women

Compar'd with her are faints. She is a foil
To let them off, and make their foulness fair.
In her incontinence she stands unrivall'd,
Burning in fires peculiar to herself,
Phoenix in lewdness.

VELASCO.

May I ask myLord
How he intends ?-But fee, the King draws near.

ABDA'LLAH .

AH '
He's much impair'd.

VELASCO.

In the decline of life! 'tis like a ftoirm.

Of all its leaves. . .

ALB ERTO.

That Prince of Persia is compos'd of pride;
He did not deign to look upon the present,

3 But

Jilt ftretch'd his sun-burnt hand straight out before

him,

Like a blind man, and would have flood so fill,
Had I not made his fingers feel the pearls.
And all the while he ftar'd me in the face,
As if he meant t'opprefs me with his eye,
And fright me with his fierce and uncouth looks.
I blufh'd at first, but anger came at last,
And bore me up.

SEB ASTIAN.

Those princes of the East,

Us'd to the servile manners of their country,
Where ev'ry proftrateRlave adores his lord,
Without intention (hock the sons of Europe.

ALBERTO.

O ! how unlike to him the King of Spain,
And that mors gentle Princess, Ormifinda!
Her look, her voice, benign and mild, dispel
The awe her rank inspires, and reassure
The modest mind. Would'st thou believe, Sebaflian,
She talk'd to me, I cannot tell how long,
Before thou cam'ft, and queftion'd me minutely
How I had liv'd, how past my youthful days?
I fear I was too copious in my answers.
What signifies my rural life to her ?
And yet she feem'd to liften with delight,
As if she had an int'reft in my fate;
Apd once or twice when I of danger spoke,

H 2 From

From which I hardly had efcap'd with life,
Methought I saw her tremble. Much Ihe blam'd
My rashness yet she prais'd my courage too,
With all her tenderness of heart, I fee
That the admires true valour.

SEBASTIAN.

So she does.

The bravest knight that e'er was clad in fReel,
Alonzo, was the lover of her youth:
And fincj he left this land the ne'er rejoic'd.
But of there matters I will tell thee more
At a convenient season. Let us follow,
And join the train before they reach the lifts,

ALBERTO.

I would not lose one moment of this fight
For half the lands of Spain. Tho' I abhor
The Persian, yet I pray devoutly for him,

ACT IV.

SCENE' I.

t'he City.
Enter ORMISINDA and T.ERESA.

ORMISINDA.
T H I S city looks as if a pestilence

Had swept the whole inhabitants away.

The solitary streets, the empty squares,
Appall me more than the deserted palace.
Let us go back again.

TERESA.

'Tis time we ihould.

You trembled at the howling of a dog,
That broke the silence and increas'd the horror.
If we flay here we shall be fancy-ftruck,
Mistake some statue for a pale-fac'd ghost,
And think it beckons with its marble arm.

ORMISINDA.

Why should this desolation frighten me?
Whyfhould I fear to fee a grave-clad ghost,
Who may so soon be number'd with the dead,
And be myself a ghost ? What noise is that?
Pid'ft thou not hear, Teresa ?

TERESA.

Yes, I did.
I heard an uncouth found.

ORMIS-NDA.

Uncouth indeed!
An universal groan! Hark! there again.

TERESA.

'Tis not the fame. This has another tone,
A shout of triumph, and a burf of joy.

ORMISINDA.

The combat's over, and my fate's determin'd.
N ow death or life !

[The trumpets found.]

TERESA.
Long may the Princess live !

And every hour be f6rtunate as this!
The Spanish trumpets found, the sign I know.
Thy champion has prevail'd.

ORMISINDA.

0 gracious Heav'n!
The lit are near, and we shall quickly learn,

TERESA.

Look yonder, flying swifter than the wind,
A horseman comes; now at the gate he lights,
And hases across the square. It is Sebastian.
His look, his gesture, speak his tidings good.

[Enter. SEBASTIAN.]..: .

SEBASTIAN.

Joy to the Princess! Vitory and peace '
The Moor is slain by brave Abdallah's hand.

ORMISINDA.

Blest be thy tongue, Sebastian ! Thou shalt find
Some better recompence than barren thanks
For there glad tidings. But the gen'rous Prince
Who fought for Spain-

SEBASTIAN.

Safeand without a wound,

Fresh for another foe, Abdallah stands.
Short was the combat : Soon the boaster fell,
Who durst defy the Christian world to arms.

ORMISIN D A.

The God of battles, whom Abdallah serves,
Has overthrown the infidel, whose truf
Was in his own right arm.

SEBASTrAN.

If I hould live

Ten thousand years, I never could forget
The solemn prelude and the fierce encounters
Thou know'ft the place appointed for the combat,
An amphitheatre by nature form'd.

ORMISINDA.
I know it well.

SEBASTIAN.
The hills, of various slope
And lhape, which circle round the spacious plain,

Were

Were cover'd with a multitude immense
Of either sex, of every age and rank,
Chritian and Moor; whose faces and attire
Strangely diversified the living scene.
Within the lifts a gallery was rais'd
In which thy father and the Moorith prince
Sate with their peers, the judges of the field.
To them the knights with flow and flately pace
Approach'd; and bound by sacred oaths declar'd
That they no charm nor incantation us'd,
But trusted in their valour and their arms.
With low obeisance then they both fell back;
And firif the Moor (for he the challenge gave)
March'd to the middle of the lifted field;
There seiz'd his ponderous mace, beneath whose

weight,

The brawny bearer bow'd; and round his head,
Like a light foil, he flourifh'd it in air.
On him with diff'rent thoughts the nations gaz'd.
But suddenly a flash of light and flame
Struck ev'ry eye from brave Abdallah's ihield,
Cover'd till then. 'Twas made of polish'd steel,
Which shone like adamant; and to a point
Rose in the centre, slanting on each fide.
This ihield the Persian Prince advancing bore
On his left arm outftretch'd, and in his right,
Thrown back a little, gleam'd a pointed sword.
Erect and high the bold Mirmallon stood,
And sternly ey'd his near-approaching foe.
Then forward sprung, and on the flaming flield
Difcharg'd a mighty blow, enough to crush

A wall,

A wall, or split a rock. The Spaniards gave
A general groan.

ORMISINDA.

That was the dreadful found
We heard, Teresa.

SEBASTIAN.
Glancing from the ihield,

Aside the mace descended. Then enrag'd,
Once more the Moor his thund'ring weapon rear'd.
In ftept the Prince, and rairing high his fhicld,
Midway he met the blow; and with the itrength
And vigour of his arm, obliquely down
The pond'rous mace he drove. Then quick as

thought,

His better hand and foot at once advancing,
Plung'd in Mirmallon's throat his thirsty blade.
The giant ftagger'd for a little space;
Then falling, shook the earth. The Chriitians rais'd
A shout that rent the air. Away I came,
Happy to be the bearer of such tidings.

[Trumpet.

ORMISIND A.

Behold, they come in triumph from the field.
O ! glorious man! And yet forgive me, Heav'n,
I grudge the conquest to Alonzo's friend,
And wish Alonzo in Abdallah's place.

VELASCO.

My Lord Alonzo,
Compole thy thoughts.

A BDALLA.H.
Behold her how fne looks,

As if she knew no ill. That harden'd heart
Againf2 remorse and fear and shame is arm'd;
Bur I shall wring it now.

KING.
Daughter, draw near I

This godlike Prince all recompence disclaims,
Save thanks from Spain. The pleasing task be thine
To greet the saviour of thy native land,
And speak our gratitude.

ORMISINDA.

No words can speak

The gratitude I feel. Believe it great
As my deliverance, vast as my difirefs !
Like .d Andromeda, chain'd to the rock
I flood a living prey, when this brave Prince,
Came like another Perseus from the sky,
And fav'd me from deflruAion. I forget,
W\rapt i n myself, the charge my father gave
To thank the saviour of my native land;
Anrthler voice {hall give thee thanks for Spain,
Alonzo's voice shall thank thee for his country,
I-ls friends, his people-fav'd.

ABDALLAH.

Ah! If I hear (Aside.)
Th'is syren longer, ffe will charm my rage;

Bur

But I remember where I heard her last.
Princess of Spain! I merit not thy praise.
Sent by Alonzo to this land I came:
What has been done, for Him I have perform'd.
Now of his promise I remind the King
To grant me one request.

KING.

Speak ! It is granted.

OR MISINDA.

If I conjecture right, even that request
Will prove one favour more on Spain conferr'd.

ABDALLAH.
Perhaps it may

KING.

Proceed, illustrious Prince!
And make me happy to fulfil thy wifil.

ABDALLAH.

Not for myself I speak, but for my friend;
And in his name, whose person I fultain
I ask for jufice on a great offender.

KING.

Thou shalt have ample and immediate justice.
Nor favour nor affinity fhail fkreen
The guilty person. Prince, why art thou troubled ?
Thou fhak'ft from head to foot. Thy quiv'ring lip
Is pale with paflion. On thy forehead fiand
Big drops. Almighty God ! What dreadful birth
Do there itrong pangs portend ?

I 2

AEDALLAH.

The guilty person,

'WThom with a capital offence I charge,
Stands by thy fide.

KING.

My daughter!
ABDALLAH.

Yes! thy daughter!

'Tis her I mean, the Princess Ormifinda.
Here in the presence of the Peers of Spain,
I charge her with a crime, whose doom the laws
Of Spain have wrote in blood! Adultery.
I read astonishment in ev'ry face!
\WIo wculd fufpe& that one so highly born,
With evry outward mark of virtue grac'd,
H.d giv'n her honour to a worthless wretch,
_n3 driv'n a noble husband to despair!

KING.

Am I awake ! Is this the light of day?
Art thou, O! Prince, with iudden frenzy seiz'd
Or is the madrefs mine ? Renown'd Abdallah !
What arlwer can be made to such a charge ?
This Arange demand ofjuftice on my daughter,
So. an offence that f.e could not commit?
Mv daughter n'eor was married.

A DALLAH.

Ask her that?
I Iar if he will deny she has a husband i

KING.
My child, thou art amaz'd !

ORMISINDA.

No, not so much

As thou wilt be, my father, when thou hear'st
Thy daughter's tongue confers she has a husband.

KING.

Haft thou a husband ! God of heav'n and earth !
Since thou haft thus dissembled with thy father,
Perhaps thou hat deceiv'd thy husband too.
Who is thy husband ? Speak !

ORMISINDA.

The Prince Alonzo.

KING.

And haft thou been so long in secret wedded ?
'Tis eighteen years since he departed hence.

ORMISINDA.

O ! I have reason to remember that.
There is no calendar so juit and true
As the fad mem'ry of a wife forsaken.
The years, the months, the weeks, the very days,
Are reckon'd, regifter'd, recorded there I
And of that period I could cite such times,
So dolorous, distressful, melancholy,
That the bare mention of them would excite
Amazement how I live to tell the tale,
But I forget the prcc.nt in the pas.t.
No wonder, for this moment is the first
lThat opes the sluices of a heart o'ercharg'd,

And

And bursting with a flood of grief conceal'd.
But I must turn me to another theme.
The earnest eyes of all are bent on me,
WVatching my looks, and prying to discern
Symptoms of innocence or signs of guilt.
Hear then the frank confession of my foul:
I have tranfgrefs'd.

KING.

Stain of a noble race!
Dost thou avow thy crime ?

ORMISINDA.

Mistake me not,

I have tranfgrefs'd my duty to my father:
Without his knowledge, and against his will,
Mov'd by a tender lover's parting tears,
I join'd myself in wedlock to Alonzo.
My King, my father, pardon the offence,
Which against thee I own I have committed:
But may I ne'er of God or man be pardon'd,
Nor friend nor father ever pity me,
If I have fwerv'd one ftep from virtue's path,
Or broke the smallest parcel of that vow
Which binds a faithful wife! 0 ! Prince of Persia!
Thou art the best of friends and benefa&ors;
Thou com'ft to end my most diftraaing woes,
And to dispel th' impenetrable cloud
That darken'd all my days. Now I shall know
Why I have been abandon'd and forsaken,
Why I have been detefled and defpis'd,

As

As never woman was. Proceed, my Lord.
And whilst thou keenly dost assail my life,
And, dearer far, my honor and my fame,
Secure in innocence, I'll calmly hear.
From thee, I hope, the end of all my cares.

ABDALLAH.

Even thus Alonzo told me she would speak,
And thus proclaim her innocence.

ORMISINDA.

Did He ?

O ! would to I-eav'n Alonzo heard me now,
Fearless defend his honor and my own !
My voice, which once was music to his ear,
Like David's harp which footh'd the gloomy king,
Would charm his malady, would drive away
The evil spirit, and call back again
The better genius of his early days.
O ! thou that wert so good, so great ! admir'd
Of all mankind ! my lov'd, my lot Alonzo
For thee, in this humiliating hour,
More than myself I mourn.

ABD ALLAH. (Half afids.)

Eternal Power!

To whom the secrets of all hearts are known !
Hear, hear this woman, and between us judge s
'Tis not my business to contend with words,
These are the conquering arms of womankind.
A nobler course of trial lies before me:
In a wrong'd husband's name I charge this lady
With infidelity; and crave the doom

5 Of

Of law upon her head. If any knight,
Spaniard or ftrnger, dares assert her cause,
Let him fland forth, and take my gauntlet up;
Which on the ground I throw, my gage to prove
That ihe is false to honor and Alonzo.

ORMISINDA.

Before the gage of death is lifted up,
Hear me one moment. By Alonzo sent,
Thou com'ft inftruced in Alonzo's wrongs.
Let me conjure thee then, by all that's dear,
By all that's sacred to the great and brave,
Thy mother's memory, thy consort's fame,
Not on a gen'ral charge, obscure and vague,
To which there is no answer but denial,
To found the claim of combat: Single out
Wha: circumstance thou wilt of special note,
Of such a kind as may be tried and known
For true or false. Tell us at least his name
With whom Alonzo's wife her honor ftain'd,
And let us be confronted.

[Young ALBERTO fJeps forth.
ALBERTO.

Heaven forbid

That thou should'st be confronted with a villain.
Princess of Spain! Be sure some wretch there is,
Some renegado, false to God and man,
Suborn'd, and ready with a lying tongue,
To second this brave Prince who wrongs thy fame,
And wounds thy modest ear. Too much by far
Already thou haft heard. Pretended Prince!

For

For there is nothing royal in thy foul!
Thou base defamer of a lady's name!
I take thy gauntlet up, and hold it high
In scorn, and fierce defiance, to thy facet
My gage to prove thy accusation falie,
And thee, the author of a tale invented
To rob a noble lady of her fame.

ORMISINDA.
Where am I now ? What shall I do, Teresa ?

[AJd^

TERESA.
The God of Heav'n direa thee !

ABDALLAH.

Boy! To thee

I answer nothing. I fufpe& the cause
Of thy presumption, and could wish that Spain
Had giv'n a worthier vi&im to my sword.

[Walks aside

ORMISIND A,

O ! valiant youth ! much am I bound to thee:
But I have reasons that import the state,
Which ahall, whatever is my fate, be known,
And own'd hereafter to be great and weighty,
Why I decline th' affitance of thy sword.
If this appeal to combat is the law,.
And I can find no champion .lut Alberto,
Without the chance of combat let me fall;
For I will not accept:---

K

A L BERTO.

Recall these words,

Too gen'rous Princess ! I can read thy thoughts
Thou think'fr my youth unequal to the foe;
Thou fear'ft the weakness of Alberto's arm.
My strength exceeds the promire of my years.
Oft have I bent the bow, and drawn the sword,
Nor fly my shafts, nor falls my sword in vain.
This day agaiDft a troop alone I fought;
But never did I fight in such a cause,
Nor was I e'er so certain to prevail.
A fire divine invades my zealous breast:
I feel the force of legions in mine arm.
Thy innocence has made thy champion ifrong!
The God of battles is our righteous judge;
And let the cause be tried.
(A warrior armed, with his helmet on, Jleps forth.)

WARRIOR.

But not by thee

Thy father's voice forbids, too daring youth !
Stand back, and let thy mailer in the art
Of war, now claim the combat for his own.
My liege !

- KING.

That voice I know: Thy figure too

Reembles much a chief, lamented long
As slain in battle. - -

WARRIOR.

I am he, Coftollo.

'Tis true, 0! king ! that on the field I fell,
Fighting for Spain. How I was fav'd from'deaths
And where, for many years I have remain'd,
This is no time to tell. This hour demands
A soldier's speech, brief prologue to his deeds.
On me, proud Persian ! turn thy gloomy eyes,
Hear me, and let thy ready sword reply.
With hell-born malice, level'd at her life,
Thou haft defam'd a Princess, honour'd, lov'd,
By all, who virtue or fair honour love.
The fell Hyena, native of thy land,
Has not a voice or heart more false than thine,
Thou counterfeit of truth! whom I defy
To mortal combat, and the proof of arms.
Thy full-blown fame, thy unexhaufted ffrength,
Deceitful confidence, I laugh so scorn;
The conquering cause is mine.

ALBERTO. -

My lord, the King l

And ye his couhfellors for wisdom fam'd!
You will not sure permit this good old man,
By fond affection for his son impell'd,
To meet so stern a foe. His hoary head,
His wither'd veins, are symptoms of decay.
Lean not upon a reed which time hath bruis'd,
Nor trust the life and honour of the Princess
To the weak arm of age.

K 2

ABDALLAH.

I'll fight you both,

Father and son at once. Together come,
Tongue-valiant men! and try Abdllah's army
I'll have it so; for both of you have dar'd,
Ignoble as you are, to match yourselves
Against a Prince who moves not in your sphere,
And utter words for which such blood as yours
Is poor atonement.

COSTOLLO.

Ev'ry word thou fpeak'fl

Is insolent and false. Son of a slave!
For'eaftern monarchs buy with gold their brides,
The blood by thee defpis'd, flows from a fourc
Purer than thine and nobler.

ALBERTO.

Nay, my father !

That's said too far. Fierce and disdainful Prince,
Vain is the offer which thy paffiop makes.
Perhaps the conqueror of the Moor may find .
One Spaniard is enough.

COST-OLLO.

A father's right

Unmov'd I claim, and with determin'd voice
Forbid the combat.

KING.

Hence let us retire

To the pavilion. There our peers (hall judge
Of your pretensions,

Broke in like thunder in his mother's cause.

When in the pride of valour forth he came,
And for my fake defied the bold Abdallah,
His look- (he feem'd a cherub in my eyes !)-
His voice (at every, word my bosom yearn'd !). - -
Transported me so much; that I forgot
His state and mine, and had well nigh sprung forth
To clasp my blooming hero in my arms.

Of age and ruggedness; how bright it' beams"

To try the pureness of fufpeted virtue.
I'll undergo whate'er can be devis'd.
By ordeal trial let 'y faith be prov'd.
Blindfold, barefooted, on the fmoaking foil,
With red hot plough-llares fpreadI1l wwalk my iway;
Plunge in the boiling oil my naked arm,
But will not risk my young Alonzo's life.,

Whilst slander's breath fulies his mother's fame.'

ORMISINDA.

Now thou haft touch'd a string, to whose deep found
A mother's heart replies. My son! my son!
I weigh thy virtues down, hang on thy life,
Attaint thy blood, thy birth, thy right to reign!
The birds of prey that dwell among the rocks,
The savage beasts that thro' the deserts roam,
The monsters of the deep, their offspring love,
And to preserve their lives devote their own.
Athwart the gloom, I fee a flafli of light,
That opens the horizon. I descry
A hand that points a high and lofty path
Which I will boldly tread. Now to my father.
Upon my knees his aid I'll first implore.

ACT V.

SCENE I.
ABDALLAH and VELASCO.

VELASCO.
BE FORE this day ihe ne'er beheld the boy,

Far from this place in Catalonia bred,

He came to fee the famous combat fought.
'Twas he, my Lord, who flew the Moorish chief,
And in his own defence such wonders wrought,
That a&ion to the Princess made him known,
The reft in honour of his valour follow'd.

ABDALLAH.
How dost thou know ?

VELASCO.

With admiration struck,

When he stood forth and brav'd a foe, like thee,
Of divers persons curious I enquir'd,
Who, and from whence he was.

ABDALLAH.

Pity it were

To hurt the stripling. 'Tis a noble boy.
I love the outbreak of his Spanish fire
Against the Moors.

VELASCO.

Ay, and against Abdallab,

'Whom antient fame and recent glory rais'd,
Above all mortal men. Spare this young plant,
Who makes so fair a fhodt.

ABDALLAH.

sHow can i spare him .

Should their eleftion fetid him to riy sword,
How, good Velafcd ?

VELASCO.

When the peers returi,

The King, the Princess, with theii champion choferi
Then to the wond'ring audience, in the face
Of her that's guilty, let my Lord relate
The truth-mark'd story he to me has told;
Deiteced thus, coifounded and furpris'd,
Pierc'd with a thousand eyes, that gaze upbri her
And dart conviction; can she fsill deny,
And by denial, make her guilt ambiguous ?
But if her sex's genius is so strong
That she the port of innocence maintains,
And, from the fulness and exeefs of vice,
Derives a boldhefs, that may look like virtues
Then let the sword decide.

ABD ALLAH;

What yot propose

14 worth the trial. I am loth to spill
The young Alberto's or Coftollo's blood

For they deserve no harm. Ev'n you, my friend,
Before my hand unclafp'd the book of shame,
Her champion would have been.

VELASCO.

Againit the world.

ABDALLAH.

I will adopt the counsel of Velafco,
And probe more deeply still her fcfter'd mind.
I fee 'tis better that Ihe liould confess
Her guilt, than with her vanquifh'd champion fall,
By doom of law, proteing to the last
Her innocence.

VELASCO.

Better a thousand times.

Her dying voice would ffake the hearts of men,
And echo thro' the world.

The peers of Spain havejudg'd. Standforth,Albero !
Behold the champion of my daughter's fame.

ALBERTO.

Before the trumpet's voice unfheaths the sword
Which one of us shall never sheath again,
Permit me, Prince of Persia, to intreat
A moment's audience: Not from fear I speak.
The cause I fight for, and the mind I bear,
Exalt me far above the thoughts of danger;
But from a conscious sense of what is due
To thee, renown'd Abdallah. In the heat
Of our contention, if my tongue has utter'd
One word offensive to thy noble ear,
Which might have been omitted, and the tone
Of firm defiance equally preferv'd;
For that I ask forgiveness.

ABDALLAH.

Less I mark'd

The manner than the matter of thy speech:
If thou dolt need forgiveness, freely take it,

KIN G.

'Twas generously asl'd, and nobly granted:
Such courtesy with valour ever dwells.
Let me too crave for a few words thine ear.
Throughout the trying bus'nefs of this day,
Thou art my witness, that my mind upright
Has never been by pow'rful nature bent,
Nor fway'd to favour and opinion form'd,
By long habitual and accuiftom'd love:
But I with equal hand the balance ield
Between thee and my child.

L 2

ABDALLAH.

Thou haft indeed.
It is but juffice that I should declare it.

KING.

Then to thy candour let me now appeal,
And beg of thee to grant me one rcqueft,
Which I do not, but might perhaps, command.

ABDALLAH.
What is it?

KING.

I have fearch'd my hapless child,

Ev'n to the pith and marrow of her foul,
Have touch'd her to the quick. She never shrinks
Nor wavers in the least. Perhaps, my Lord !
Some fool officious, or some wretch that's worf:,
(If there is ought comes between man and wife
That's more pernicious than a medling fool)
Some false designing friend has wrong'd her fame,
And pour'd his poison in Alonzo's ear.
If thou wilt give some scope to her defence,
And bring the charge from darkness into light,
Then (he fiall forthwith answer on the spot
Where now fie stands before us.

ORMISINDA.

If I fail

To c'ear my fame ev'n in Abdallah's fight;
If but one dark suspicious speck remains
To make mine honour dim, let me be held

Guilty

Guilty of all. Before-hand I renounce
The right of combat, and submit to die.

ABDALLAH.

Thy with is fatal, but it ihall be granted,
This instant too.

ORMISINDA.
Blessings upon thy head!

Ten thousand blessings! O ! thou doff not know
SHow happy thou haft made me. On my breast
A mountain lay: Thy hand has heav'd it off;
And now I breathe again.

ABDALLAH.

0 woman wo! woman!

A little way from hence my people wait;
With them remains a necessary witness,
Thither I go, and quickly will return
To ring thy knell. [Exit Abdallah.]

ORMISINDA.

The knell of all my woes!

My heart knocks at my fide, as if 'twould burf
Itself a passage outwards. Yet a while;
Poor fuff'ring heart, and thou shalt beat no more.
Shortly for what I am I shall be known,
Then let my doom be fquar'd to my desert
Without indulgence.

Thine eye secure beams innocence and honour.

Haft thou no other witness than thyself ?

. - ALONZO.
I have no o-hir, and none else require,

KING.

Unfeeling man, to trifle with our sorrows,
And like a pageant play a mimic feen'e.
This is thy hatred of Pelagio's house,
Thy paflion to confound a rival race.
Would I were young again.!

ALBERTO. [To AlonZo.]

Defend thiyfeif. -
I can no longer hold me from thy breast

PELAGIO.
Sound, trumpet, found! and Heav'n defend the

right!

A L ONZO. [Drawing his Swword. -.
His blood be on your heads.

[Ormifinda throws bherelf between their SvJord.]

ORMISINDA.
Hold! Strike thro' me !

You know not what you do, unhappy both !
This combat must not, nor it ihall not be.
The Sun in Heav'n-would backward turn his course,
And shrink from such a fpe&acle as this, Â·
More horrid than the banquet of Thyestes.
You have no quarrel. I'll remove the cause.
A Roman matron, to redeem her fame,
Before her husband's and her father's eyes
Plung'd in her breift the steel.

KING.
01 DEefp'rate deed!
What fury urg'd thy hand ?

ORMISINDA.

Condemn me noti

There was no other way to fave-but that
Mull not as yet be told. My husband! heat
My dying voice ! my latest words believe,
Whole truth my blood hath seal'd I'm innocent:
As I for mercy hope at that tribunal
Where I shall soon appear, I never wrong'd thee;
When that is manifest, remember me
As love like mine deferv'd, and to-this youth,
Who is-

ALONZO.

Who is this youth! All-feeing Cod t

A secret horror comes upon my foul,
Who is this youth!

ORMISINDA.

He is thy son.
ALONZO.

, My son!

ORMISINDA.

Whom thy forsaken wife in sorrow bore,
And gave in secret to Coftollo's care.

ALBERTO.
Art thou my mother! Dost thou die for me

ORMISINDA.

I die with pleasure to be just to thee.
0 ! if that Power which did inspire my foul
To rulh between your swords, would let me live,

i TQ

To prove my innocence. Alonzo speak !
Whillt I have breath to answer.

ALONZO.

Tho' difarm'd

And foften'd, even if guilty to forgive thee,
Thy solemn call I instantly obey.
That night appointed for our last farewel,
That fatal night for ever curst-- thou know'ft
What happen'd then.

OR MSIND A.
I know thou didil not come,
Forlorn thou lefted'lt me.

ALONZO.

Thou waft not forlorn,
In the dark wood with thee there was a youth,

O R MI S IN D A, (After afpauf.)
0 heaven and earth, a youth! It was Teresa.

ALONZO.
Teresa !

TERESA.
Yes, that memorable night,
My brother's sword and helmet plum'd I wore.

ALONZO.
Great God! the snares of hell have caught my foul.

TERES A.

The night before, the Princess, as flie went,
Was fright'ned in the wood, and I assumed
That warlike form, to seem--

M

ALONZO.

No matter why ?
r-., v -h.e then; and thought thee what thou feem'dft.

KING.

She's innocent; like gold try'd in the fire,
Her honour shines: Would I had died for thee!

[To ORhMSINDA.

ORMISIND A.
Why didft thou never till this moment speak ?

[To ALONZO.

ALONZO.

Because I'm born and deftin'd to perdition.
Had I a voice like )Etna when it roars;
For in my breaff is pent as hot a fire:
I'd speak in flames.

ORMISINDA.

My Lord!
ALONZO.

Do not forgive me.

Do not oppress me with such tender looks:
I will not be forgiven.

[ORMISINDA raising berfelf and fretching

out her arms.
ORMISIND A.

Come to my arms

And let me sooth thine anguish. Had I been
What I to thee appear'd, thy rage wasjuft.
A Spaniard's temper, and a Prince's pride,

A Lover's

A Lover's passion, and a Husband's honour,
Prompted no less.

A L O N Z O.

Hear, men and angels hear.
Let me fall down and worship.

[Ethrows hinfef into ler arms.

Oh I loved thee!
I lov'd thee all the while, to madness loved.

ORMISINDA.

My husband! dear as ever to my heart!
In my last moments dear !

ALONZO.

My heart is torn.

My head, my brain ! How bleat I might have been!
With such a wife, with such a son !

ORMISINDA.

To him

Pay all the debt of love thou ow'ft to me:
Embrace thy son before mine eyes are clos'd:
Let me behold him in his father's arms.

ALONZO.
Thou brave defender of thy mother's fame !

ORMISINDA.
He's gentle too; his foul dissolves in grief.

ALONZO.

My falt'ring tongue dares scarcely call thee son.
CanI thou endure the touch of such a father ?

M

A I. E R T O.

lMy bursting heart, am:ut its grief is proud
Of such a ir.her. Let mr. clasp th, knees,
And ielp to reconcile.thcc to thylilf.

This pleasing fight lu'bdues the pains of death,
My son

ALBERTO.

My mother, Oh!
O R M I S I N D A.

My dearest husband-

ALON Z O.

Whatwould'ft thou fay. Alas! thine eye grows dim;
Thy voice begins to fail.

ORMISINDA.

Remember me

When I am dead; remember how I lov'd you.
And thou, Alonzo, live to guard thy son,
To fix the Spaniih scepter in-

[Dies looking at herfon.
Alonzo -cs!ains silent, witb his sees fixed upon

Orm.ifinda.

ALBERTO.

My father! .

Under thy gather'd brows I fee despair:
Have pity on thy son, who liv'd so long
In total ignorance of what he was:

Who

Who has already seen one parent die,
And for the fad survivor trembles now.
My mother's lafd request !

ALONZO.

I'm mindful of it,

And to her sacred memory will be just.
Hang not on me, my son ! go to the King
And pay thy duty there.

[The King embraces Alberto.
KING.

My child, my all !
I lov'd thee at firit fight.

ALONZO.

'Tit well; 'tis well.

The good old King hath still some comfort left.
Now is my time. [Draws his sword.

Oft have I itruck with thee,

But never fIruck a foe with better will
Than now myself. [Stabs himself and falls.

VELASCO, COSTOLLO.

Alas !
(ALBERTO turning.)

ALBERTO.

'Twas this I sear'd.

ALONZO.

There was good cause to fear. I would have liv'd
For thee, if I with honour could have liv'd,

My

E frn t thy fathers were renown'd in arms:
The valour of our warlike race is thine:
Eut guard against the impulse of their blood.
Take warning by my fate.

PELAGIO.

Thou might'ft have liv'd,

Renrow'd Alonzo; even I forgave
And pitied thee.

ALONZO.

I am more just than thou-

For I did not forgive, nor would I live,
Upon the alms of other men; their pity-
Farewel, my son! 0 Ormifinda, flay
'Till I a'crt ke thee. [Dies.

(Tie King to ALBERTO.)

PELAGIO.

Dwell not on this fight,
Prince of Aituria ! leave the scene of sorrow.
