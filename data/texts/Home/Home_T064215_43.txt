IWh has not heard of gallant Pierc's name?

And ever) hero 'was a hero's fire.

Upfpruns= the Phenixfrom biiparent's ltomb.
But whilfi thbfe generous rivals /fought and fell,

'hese generous rivals lov'd each other 'well:
_ Though many a losdy fiedd 'was li and 'won,

othint in hate, in honour all was done.
When Pierc 'w'ong'd, dify'd his prince or peers,
Fast came the Douglas wish his S&ttifh spears;
And .hen prcr.d Douglas made bis King his foe,
F or Douglas, Pierry bent bis Englh bow.
Experld ib:ir native homes by adverse fate,
They knock'd alternate at each other's gale:

.SCENE, the Court of a Cafle,fierrotnded 'with Woods,

Enter Lady RAN DQLP H.
Lady R. J7'E woods and wilds, whose melan-

.L choly gloom

Accords with my foul's sadness, and draws forth
The voice offorrow from my burlting heart,
Farewdli a while: I will not leave you long;
.For in your ihades I deem some spirit dwells,
Who tram a chiding llream, or groaning oak,
Still hears and auifwers to Matilda's moan.
Oh, Ddtglas! Douglas ! 'if departed gholts
-Are e'er permitted to review this tvorld,
*Within the circle of that wood thou art,
.And with the pailion of immortals hear'st
My lamentation: hear'st thy wretched wifi
Weep for her hulband slain, her infant loft.
My brother's timeless death I feeim to mouri;
Who perifh'd'with thee on this fatal day.
To thee I.lift my voice; to thee address
The plaint which mortal ear has never heard:
Oil, disregard mejnot; thlugh I am call'd
Another's nowv, myheart is wholly thine.
Incapable of change, after.ion lies
Buricd, my Douglas, in thy bloody grave.
But Randolph comes, whom fare has mad'e my Lord,
To chide my anguifl, and defraud thle dead.

Entier Lord RAN DOLPH.

Lord R. Again these weeds of woe ! fay, dolt thout

To feed a pa'lion which conflmres thy life - [well
The living claim fime duty; vainly thou
IHerltow'l thy cares upon the silent dead.

Lady R. Silent, alas! is he for whom I mourn:

Childless, without memorial of his name,
He only now in my remembrance lives.

- A z Lord R.

L£rdR- Time, that wears out the trace of deepRft

angnifh,

Has past o'er thee in vain. ' Would thou wer't not,

Compos'd of grief and tenderness alone !'

Sure thou art not the daughbter of Sir Malcormb:
Sir, ng was his rage. eternal his resentment:
For wheA tby bro.her fell, he fmil'd to hear
That Douglas' f,;n in the fame field wasfiain.

Lady .R. Oh ! rake not up the ashes of my fathers:

Impl3cable resentment awas the c:iie,
And grievoos has the expiation hoen.
Contending with the Douglas, ga!!ant lives
Of either house were lo!t: my anceltors
Comi-ell'd, at lat, to leave their ancient feat
On Tiviot's pleasant banks: and new, of them
No heir is left. had they not been so Item,
I had njt been ;he la'i of all my race.

Lord R Thy grief wre!:s to its yurpofes my woos.

I never aIk'd of thee that ardent Jove,
Whirh in the hbeafts of fiacy's children burns,
Deceni affeAion, and complacent kindnefr
Were all 1 will'd for: bat I wfi'd in vain,
Hence with the !ekfs regret my eyes behold
The storm of war that gathers o'er this land;
If ihonld'perifih by the Danifih fwordr
,.Iatiida would not shed one tear the more.

Lady R. Thou do'st not think so ; woeful ae I nnm,

I love thy merit, and elleem your virtues.
But whither go'Pc thou now ?

LordR. Straight to the camp,

Where every warrior on tip. toe ttands
Ofexpectation, and impatient aiks
Each who arrives, if he is come to tell
The Danes are landed.

Ladj R. Oh, may adverse winds,

Far fromthe coast of Scotland drive their fleet!
And every soldier of both holts return
In peace and safety to his pleasant home! [ifh,

Lsrad R. Thou fpeak'lI a woman's, hear a warrior'!

Right from their-native land; the Rftormy north, .
May the wind blow, till every keel i» six'd
lmmioyeabk ia Caledonia's sirand .

. Then

Then hall'our foes repent their bold inva'fon,
And roving armies (hun the fatal ihore.

Lady R. War I detest: but war with foreign foes,

· Whose manners, language, and whose looks are
' Is not so hbrrid, nor to me so hateful, [ftrangce
'As 'ht which with"our neighbours oft we wage.

A river here, there an ideal line.

' By fancy drawn, divides the tiaer kingdomss.

On each fide dwells a people imilar,

' As twins are to each other, valiant both,.
· Both for their valour famous through the world.
' Yet will they not unite their kindred arivs, ,

And, if they. mut.have.war, wage difftant war, -

' But with each other fight in cruel confhlt.

Gallant in ltrife, and noble ini their ire,.
The-battle is their pi'ime. They go forth,
' Gay in the morning, as to summer sport:
: When ev'ning comes, the glory of the morn,
' 'The youthful warrior, is a clod of clay;-
; Thus fallthe prime ofeither haplefs'land:
' And such the fruit of Scotch and English wars.

' Lord R. 1'll hear no more-: this melody would

' .4 soldier drop his sword, and-doff his arms, [make

Sit down and weep the conqueflts he hab made ;

· Yea, like a monk, snog rei!t and peace in heav'n
· To fouls of warriors in his battles slain,'
Lady, fdrewell: I leave thee not alone;
Yonder comes one whole love makes duty light. [Exit.

.Enter ANNA.

-Anna. Forgive the rashness ofyour Anna's love "
Urg'd by afiction, I have thus prefum'd
To interrupt your solitary thoughts;
And warn you of the hours that yoil negleO,
And lose in sadness.

Lady R. So to lore my hours
Is all the use I wiso to make of time.

Atnna. To blame thee, lady, suits not with my slate

But sure I am, fiaice death firil prey'd on man,
Never did filter thus a brother mourn.
What had your sorrows been if you had loft,
Ia early youth, -the hulband of your heart ?

'Aq Lady R.

L4,, A. Oh!
.Ana. Have I -difirefi'd you with ofcioui love,

Anil!-tim'd mention of yonr brother's fate?
Forgive me, lady; humble though I am,
The mind I bear, Fartakes not of my fortune:
So fervently I love you, that to dry
These piteous tears, I'd throw my life away.

Lad R. What Fouc er direced thy unconfcioas tolagne
To rpeak as thou haft done ? to name--

Aaro. I know not:

But since my words have made my miflrefs trembl:,
iwill speak no more; but silent mix
·ily tears with hers.

Lady R. No, thou shalt not be silent.

I'll trufi thy faithful love, and thou halt be
Idenceforth th'inflrnuted partner of my woes.
But what avails it? Can thy feeble pity
Roll back the flood of never ebbing time'?
Compel the erth and ocean to give up
Their dead alive ?

.dBa. What means my nob'e miflrefs ?
Lady R. Didft ihoau not ask what had my sorrows

If I in early youth had loll a hulfband.-- [been,--.
In :he cold bosom of the earth is Iodg'd,
~langl'd with wonund, the husband ofmyyouth;
And in fame cavern of the ocean lies

Iy child and his---
adra. Oh! lady most rever'd!

The tale wrapt up in your amazing words
Deign to unfold.

!ci,/ R. Alas! an'ancient feud,

lereditary evil, was the fonrte
Of my misfortunes. ' Ruling fate decreed,
That my brave brother fihonidin battle save
The life of Dongias' son, our house's foe:
The vonthful warriors vow'd eternel friendship,
To fee the vaunted fiicr of his friend,
Impatient, Douglas to Balarmo came,
Under a borrow'd name-My heart he gain'd;
Nor did I long refnufe the hand he begg'd:
14y brother's prefence'aunhoriz'd our marriage.
Tihree weeks, three little weeks, with wings of down,

Had

Had o'er us flown, when my lov'd L6rd was call'd
To fighthis father's battles; and with him,
In spite of all my tear;, did Malcomb go.
Scarce were they gone. when my stern fire was told
That the false stranger was lord Douglas' son.
Frantic with rage, the baron drew his sword
And qcelion'd me. Alone, forfakeri, faint,
Kneeling beneath his sword, faolt'ring I took
An oath equivocal, that I ne'er would
Wed one of Douglas' name. Sincerity!
Thou first of virtues, let no mortal leave
Thy onward path! although the earth mhould gape,
And from the gulph of hell deftrution cry
To take difimulation's winding way.

Anna. Alas ! how few of woman's fearful kind
Durst own a truth so hardy !

Lad..R. The firRft truth

Is easiest to avow. This moral learn,
This precious moral, from~my tragic tale.-
Jn a few days the dreadful tidings came
That Douglas and my brother both were slain.
My lord ! my life ! my husband! -mighty Heaven!
What had I done to merit such affli&tion ?

Anna. My dearest lady ! many a tale of tears

I've liflen'd-to; but never did I hear
A tale so fad as this.

Ladj R. In the first days

Of my diflra&ting grief I found myself-..
As women wish to be who love their lords.
But who durlt tell my father ? The good prielt
Who join'd our hands, my brother's ancient tutor,
With his lov'd Malcomb, in the battle fell:
They two alone wvere privy to the marriage. -
On silence and concealment I refolv'd,
Till time fliould make my fathe?'s fortune mine.
That very night on which my son was born,
My'nurfe, the only confidant I had,
Set out with me to reach her fifier's houie:
But narfe, nor infant, have I ever seen,
Or heard of, Anna, since that fatal hoaur.
· My murder'd child '-had thy fond mother sear'd
' The loss of thee, he had loud fame defv'd,

' Defpis'd

' Defpis'd her father's rage, her father's grief,
' And winder'd with thee ;hro' the.fcorning wborld.'

A'na. Not-feen, nor heard c:f! then.perhaps helives.
La4F.R. No. It was dark December; wind and rain

Had bear all night. Across the Carron lay
ThM defin'd road; and in its fweliing fl-od
My f-ithfu! fervadt rerifh'd with my child.
· Oh, hapless son ! of a molt hap.Lfs fire ! -
' But they are both at reit; and I alod e
" Dvell in this w:r!d ofwoe condemn'd to walk,
' Like a guilt trcubled.ghofi, my painful round ;'
Nor hat despiteful fate permitted me
The comfort of a foli:ary sorrow. -
- Thounh dead to love, I wai compeil'd to wed
Randolph, who fr.atch'd me from a viliain5s arms;
And Randolph now pofieffes the domains,
That by Sir Malcomb's death on me devolv'd;
Domains, that fhouid to Douglas' son have giv'n
A baron's title and a baron's power.
· Such were my soothing thoughts, while I bewvaild
' The flaughter'd father of a son unborn.
' And when that son came, like a ray from heaven,
· Which Ihines and difappea:s; alas ! my child !

And hiltherwards he-fljwly ftalks-his way.

Lady R. I will avoid' him. An ungracious perfoa
Is doubly irksome in an hour like this, [heir ?

Anna. Why speaks my lady thus of Randolph's
Lady R. 'Because he's not the heir of Randolph's

Subtle and fhrewd,'he offers to mankind [virtues.
An artificial image of himself;
And he with ease can vary to the taste
Of different men, its features. ' Self denied,

And mailer of his appetites he seems:
' But his fierce nature, like a fox chain'd up,

Watches to seize unseeo the wish'd for prey,
Never uwere vice and virtue pois'd so ill,
As in Glsenalvpn's unrelenting mind.'

Yet is he brave and politic in war,
.And llands aloft in these unruly times,
Why. I describe him tbus'I'll tell hereafter,

Whose valour fav'd me from a wretchd death ![youth,

Rovers, I judge, fiom the licentious camp,
Who would ha'e quicklsy'laid Lord Randolph low,.
Had not this brave and generous stranger come,

And, mocking danger, made my foes his own.
They turn'd upon him; but his asive'arm
Struck to theground, fr..m whence they rose no more,

And left him malter of thie bloody field.
Speak, Lady Randolph; upon beauty's tongue
ID)well accents pleating to the brave and bold.
SFeak, noble dame, and thank him for thy. Lord.

Lady R. My Lord, I cannot speak what now I feel.

My heart o'erflowsv with gratitude to heav'ai,
And to this noble, youth, who all unknow'n
To you and yours; deliberated not,
Nor paus'd at peril, but humanely brave
Fought on your fide, against such fearful odds,
Ha'e you not learn'd of him whom ;e fnould thank?
Whom call the saviour of Lord Randolph's life?

LordR. I ask'd that quellion, and he anfwer'd not:

But I mullt know who my deliverer is, [To the.Stranger.-

Strung. A low born man, of parentage obscure,

Who nought can boast but his desire to be -
A soldier, and to gain a name in arms.

Lord R. Whoe'er thou art, thy spirit is ennobled

By the great (Kiig of Kings thou art ordain'd
And ltampt a hero by the fivereign hand
Of nature! blush not, flower of modefiy
As well as valour, to declare thy birth.

Strang. My name isNorval: on the Grampion hills

My fatner feeds his flocks;.a frugal iwain,
Wibofe conltant cares were to iotreale his fore,
And keep his only son, myself, a't home.
For 1 had-heard of bdtrles, and I long'd
To lol.low to the field some warlike lord;
'And heav'n toon granted what my fire deny'd.
This moon which rose laII night, round as my shield,

Had

Had not yet fill'd her.horns, when, by her light,
A band of fierce barbarians'from- the hills,
Rufh'd like a. tourrent down upon the vale,
S eeping our flocks and herds. The shepherds fled
For safety, and for fucconr. I alone,
With bended bow, and quiver fu'l of arrows,
HJver'd about the-enemy, and.mark'd
The road he tock; then hailed to my friends,
Whom,. with a-roop of fifty chosen men,
_ 1 met advancing. The parfait I led,

'Till we o'ertook the fpoil-encumber'd'foe. -
We fought ahd conquer'd. Ere a sword was drawn,
An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,
Who wore that day the arms which now I wear.
Returning home in triumph; I difdain'd
The hepherd's flothfnl life; and having heard
That our good king had fummon'd his bild peers
To lead their warriors to.the Carron fide,
I left my father's house, and took with me
A chosen servant to condut my steps:;.
Yon trembling coward, who forsook his maftiler.
- Journeying with this intent, I past there towers,

And, heaven-direaed, came this day tb do
The happy deed that gilds my humble name.

Lord R. He is as wife as brave. Was ever tale

With foch a gallant modefity rehears'd ?
My brave deliverer! thou shalt enter now
A nobler lilt, and'in a monarch's fight
Contend with princes for the prize of fame,
I will present thee to our Scottilh king,
Whose valiant spirit ever valour lov'd.
Ha! my Matilda! wherefore ltarts that tear?

Lady R. I cannot fay: for various affecions,

And lirangely. mingled, in my bosom swell;
Yet each of them may well command a tear.
I joy that thou art safe; and Iadmire
Him and his fortunes who hath wrought thy safety;
Obscure and fiiendlefs, he the army fought,
Bent upon peril, in the range of death
Refolv'd to hunt for fame, and -with his sword
To gain- dilinti6n-which his birth denied.
In this attempt unknown he might have perilh'd,

And

And gain'd with all his valour, but oblivion.
Now grac'd by thee, his virtue serves no more
Beneath despair. The fo!diernow of hope
lHe siands conspicuous; fame and great renown
Are brought within the compass of his sword.
On this my mind refleted, whilst you spoke,
And blefs'd the wonder-working hand of Heaven;

-Lor'dR. Pious and grateful ever are thy thoughts!
My deeds Thall followwhere thou point'it the way.
Next to myself, and equal to Glenalvon,
In honour and command Ihall Norval be.

Nor. I know not how to thank you. Rude I am,

In speech and manners never till this hour
Stood I in fuchaprefence: yet, my Lord,-
There's something in my breast, which makes me~bold
To fay, that Norval ne'er will ibame thy favour.

Lady R; I will be sworn thou wilt not. Thou malt

My knight: and ever;as thou dolt to-day, [be
With happy valour guard.the life of Randolph.

Lord R. Well halt thou spoke. Letme forbid reply.

[To Norval.

We are thy debtors till ; thy high desert
O'ertops our gratitude. I muff proceed,
As was at first intended, to the camp.
Some of my train Ifee are speeding hither,
Impatient, doubtless, of their Lord's delay.
Go with me, Norval, and thine eyes ihall'fee
The chosen warriors of thy native land,
Who lahguifh for the fight, and beat the air,
With brandifh'd swords.

Nor. Let us be gone, my Lord.

Shall his broad orbit o'er yon hills furpend,
Expe& us to return, This night once more
Within these walls I reft; my tent I pitch
To-morrow'in the field. Prepare the feafi.

He in the eve of battle may resign
Himself to social pleasure; sweetest then,

[Exeunt Randolph and. Norval.

Lady R. His parting words have flruck a fatal truth.,
Oh, Douglas! Douglas! tender was the time,
Whenwe two parted, ne'er to meet again !
How many years of anguifh-and derpair
Has heaven annex'd to those swift passing hours
Of love an.fondnefs.' 'Then my bosom's flame

A grave-that bed in which the weary refi.
Wretch that I a i! Alas ! why am I so r
At every happy parent I repine !
How blelt the mother of.yon gallant Norval! '
She for a living husband bore her pains,
And heamd him bless be? when a man was born:
She nnrs'd her fmiiing infant on her breast; .
Tended the child, and rear'd the pleasing boy:
She, with affetion's triumph, law the youth
In grace and comeiinefs furIpafshis peers:
Whilff I to a dead huiband bose a son,
And to the roaring waters gave my child.

Anna. Alas! Alas! why will you thus resume

Your grief afresh ? I thought that gallant youth
Would for awhile have won you. from your wMe
On him intent you gazed, with a look

.

Much more delighted, than your penfis'e .eye
Has deign'd on other obje&s to betow.

Lady R. Delighted, fay'ft th u ? Oh! even'there

Found fuel far my iife-confuming sorrow; [mine eye
I thought, that had the son of Douglis Iiv'd,
He might have-been like this young gallant fitranger,
And pair'd with him in features and in shape.
In all endowments, ai in years, I deem,
My boy with blooming Norval might have number'd.
Whilst thus I mns'd, a spark from fancy fell
On my fad hearr, and kindled up a fouidnefs
For this young stranger wand'ring from his home,

A- nd

And like an orphan calf upon my care.

With all my powver, and grace withlall my favour.

'Anna. Sure heav'n will bless so gen'r6us a resolve.

Y'u mufll, my noble dame, exert your power:
You must awake: devices will be fram'd,
And arrows pointed at the brea of 6fNorval.

LadyR. Glenalvon's false and crafiy head will work

Against a rival in his liinfmans love,
IfI deter him not; I onily can.

# ACT III.

Why, rape and murder are not simple means ?.
Th' imperfe& rape to Randolph gave a spo'use ;
And the intended'murder introduc'd
A favourite to hide the fun from me ;
And worst ofall, a rival. Burning hell!
This were thy center, if I thought fie lov'd him!
'Tis-certaib hlie contemns me; nay,: commands me,
And waves the flag of her displeasure o'er me,
In his, behalf. And siall I thus be brav'd ?

Infernal fiends, if any fiendsthere are
More fierce than love, ambition, and revenges
Rife up, and fill my bofomin with your fires.
' And policy remorseless !. Chance may spoil
"A single aim ; but perseverance mufit
' Prosper atlas. For chance and fate are words:
' Perfitiive wifdomis the fate of man.'
Darkly a project peers upon my mind,
Like the red mnoon when riling in the east,
Crofs'dmdand diivided by ftrange.colour'd clouds.

And for his cowardice was spurned from him.

And like a peasant bleed the noble child.
That none might nmark the change of our elate,
We leFt the country, travell'd.to the north,
Bought flocks and herds, and gradually Brought forth
Our secret wealth. But God's all-feeing eye,
Belh'eld our avarice, and smote us fore.
For one by one all our ownl children died,
And he the stranger, sole remain'd the heir
Of what indeed was his. Fain then would I,
Who with a father's fondness lov'd the boy,
Have trulted him, now in the dawn of youth,
With his own secret: but my anxious wife,
Forboding evil, never would consent.

And, as we oft obferv'd, he bore himself,

To-daythe baron started at your tears.

As he does now, so look'd his noble father,

But, when the matter match'd his mighty mind,

This day I brav'd him in behalf of Norval:
Perhaps too far: at least my nicer fears
For Douglas thus interpret.

To win a country, or to lose themselves.

Amidst the shock of armies I'll defend,
And turn death from him, with a guardian ainm.

And woman also! flattery dire&
Rarely difguis. They little know mankind
Who doubtits operation: 'tis my key,
And opes the wicket of the human heart.
How far I have succeeded now, 1 know not.

And amity, uncertain is my tenure.

I ihew'd him gold, and he has pawn'd his fcul
To fay and swear whatever I foggest.
Norvai I'm. told, has that alluring look,
'Twixt man and woman, which I have obferv'd
To charm the nicer and fantastic dames,
Who are like Lady Randolph, fu:l of virtue.

But point him to the truth. He seldom errs

Grief cannot break a heart so hard as mine.

With thee, or any thing? My son I my son I
My beautiful!, mfy brave! how proud was I
Of thee, and of thy valour; my iond. heart
O'erflow'd this day with transport, when I thought
Of growing old amidst a race of thine,
Who might make up to me their father's childhood,
And bear my brother's and my hulband's name.
Now all'm'y hopes are dead ! A. little while
Was I a wife! a mother not so long !
What am I now --I know.-But I shall be

And such a huiband drive meto my fate. [rota ouht

Above the narrow limits that confia'd it I

And her white hands to heaven, fcemin' to fay,
Why am I forc'd to this? she plung'd herself
Into the empty air.

Lord R. I will not vent,

In vain complaints, the pafllion of my foul.
Peace in this wvor:, I never can enjoy.
These wounds the gratitude of Randolph gave;
They fpesk aloud. and with the voice of fate.
Denource iy doom. I amrefolv'd. I'll go
Straight to the battle, where the man that mikes
Me urn aside muff threaten worse than death.
Thou faithful to thy miflrefs, take this ring,
Full warrantof my power. Let every rite
With coif and pomp upon their funerals wait:
For Randolph hopes he never lhall return. [Exeunt;

EPILOG U'E.

AN Epilogue I ajk'd; b.t pot one 'word
Our bard 'will 'write. He .oows 'tis moar aiard '
With :omic awit to contradit the strain
Of tragedy, and make jour /sorrow vain.
Sadly he fays, that pity is the heft,
And ncble/1l pa/on of the human breast :
For when its f/cred freams the heart o'eft'sw,
In gUhes plea/re with the tide of woe;
And when its waaues retire, l!ke thlofe of Nile,
They leave behind him uch agolden /oil,
That there the virtrues 'witbout culture grow,
There hthefoeet hle1sms of a.fgin blhwo.
9~efe 'were his 'words; void of delh/i've art,
Ifelt them, for he jjoke them from his hearto
Nor wil/ I now attempt, 'wi:h ,witty folly,
iT chafe away cele/lial melancholy,
