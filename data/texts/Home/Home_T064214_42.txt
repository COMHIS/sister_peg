ADV ERTISEM EENT.
T H E author of the following Tragedy, has,

in his former attempts of the fame kind,

avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication
or preface. His chief reason for dcilining this
common mode of appearing before the public,
was the necessity, which it would lay him under,
of speaking concerning himself and his works.
The success of Alonzo calls upon him to depart
from his former plan; and to break that silence,
which might now be reckoned arrogant, and even
ungrateful, to those, from whom he in a great
measure derives his success.

He embraces with pleasure, this occasion, to

acknowledge his obligations to THE iMANAGERS of
the theatre, whose friendly, anxious, and acive
zeal he hath so often experienced: To THE PER-,
FORMERS, who have so strenuously contended with
each other, in their very generous endeavours to
embellish the representation of the piece: To
MRS. BARRY-but the public voice has exalted
EHER above his praise: Yet he claims the merit of

A 2 havingl

having, before others, observed her now allowed

and unrivalled excellence. From the colour of
the dawn, he foretold the brightness of the day.

For MRS1 BARRY he wrote the part of Ormi-

linda, and the mot flattering circumstance to him,
in the success of his play, is the universal opinion,
(vouched, not only by the loudest applause that
ever (hook the flage, but by the greatest effusion
of tears) that the ACTRESS so much exalted THE
CHARACTER, that (he exceeded all imagination,
and reached the furmit of perfection.

SCENE I.
A hall in the palace of the kings of Spain.

ORMISINDA. TERESA.

ORMISINDA.

j.:'n HIS roll contains the secret of my life,
. T , And of the slate: My marriage with
~k.>|_ i Alonzo,

The story of my son, my injured child,
Bred in a desert, tho' the heir of Spain.
To thee, my faithful friend, my lov'd Teresa!
This precious record I commit. Oh ! keep it
From fight of human eye, till better times:

B For

For fill I hope that better times may come,
Tho' not to me, to this affliaed land.,
My hand hath signed it, and my act to day
Shall give it faith and credence with mankind.
This will explain the mystery of my fate,
And tell the world why Ormifinda died.

[Gives the writing.]

TERESA.
Do not too soon despair.

OR MVISIND A.

I wait the la]r

Decisive moment. But to guard my foul
Against the rallies of a rafi despair,
Againfithe weakness which attends surprise,
I have forecast whatever may befall,
And fram'd to the event my firm resolve.
This is the day appointed so' the combat,
Between a Moorifl and a Christian knight,
To end the wars of Spain, and fix the fate
Of the contending nations.

TERESA.

Antient times,

If tales of ancient times may be believ'd,
Have known such combats. In her infant state,
Against her rival Alba, Rome was pledg'd
As now Afturia is: But later times
Afford no parallel. 3

ORMISINDA.

There never was,

Nor will there ever, while the world endures,
Be found a parallel to my distress-
I am the viftor's prize---whoe'er prevails
He gains the princess, and the crown of Spain.
Such is the solemn treaty, sworn, confirm'd,
By every rite, which either nation owns.
Mean while I am Alonzo's wedded wife---
I am a mother---by the false Alonzo,
Who from his hate to me abandons Spain,
Which he alone can save. No other arm
Can match Mirmallon's force. Proud of his firength
Already in the lifts the Moor exults,
Secure of vitory. The setting fun
Concludes the dreadful period of fufpence,
And death alone from infamy can save me.

TERESA.

He yet may come. Far in the Nubian wilds,
That guard the secret sources of the Nile,
Velafco found the chief. The wind offpring,
The constant East, this year forgot its season,
And only since this moon her light renew'd,
Began to blow upon the western shore.
On that I build a hope.

ORMISINDA.

I have no hope
Review the flory of my life, Teresa,

B 2 And

And by the past conje&ure of the future.
First my lamented brother, blindly led
By proud Ramirez, quarrell'd with Alonzo,
Then by Alonzo's sword Ramirez fell.
For that offence to banishment condemn'd,
Alonzo won me to accept his hand
Before he left this kingdom. Since that time,
What I have fuffer'd, Heav'n, and you can tell,
It was the fifth, a memorable day,
After our marriage, when he fail'd to come,
At the appointed place to meet his bride.
Then 'midst my fear, anxiety, and sorrow,
For only death I thought, or dangerous harm,
Could keep him from my arms, amaz'd I heard
That he was gone for Asia. To this hour,
Ev'n to this present hour, no cause affign'd
But there diftraaed lines long after sent:
s" Thou never shalt behold Alonzo more;

The foul, foul cause thy guilty conscience knows."

My conscience knows no cause, so help me Heav'n!
Now, in my utmost need, this dreadful day,
When I must struggle with despair and Death,
To keep myself a chaste, a blameless wife,
And to my silent grave the secret bear,
That my dear son and his may live to wield
The sceptre of his fathers !

TERESA.

To this hour,
Thy husband knows not that he is a father,

ORMISIND A:

His ears, his eyes are ihut. Oft' have I sent
Letters that would have pierc'd an heart of sone;
Pleading for pity, begging but to know,
Wherein I had unwittingly offended:
But every letter, with unbroken feal,
To me return'd. He will not read one word
From my detested hand.

TERESA.

'Tis very itrange,

And much unlike the way of other men.
For tho' they are inconstant in their love,
There is a course and process in the change.'
Ardent at first, their ardor lasts not long.
With easy, full, secure possession cloy'd,
Their passion palls, and cold indifference comes,
As chilly autumn steals on summer's prime,
Making the green leaf yellow. Then it is
That some new beauty takes their roving eyes,
And fires their fancy with untafted charms.
But in a moment, from excess of love,
To the extreme of hate Alonzo pass'd
Without a cause. Nor did another come
Between thee and the current of his love.
'Tis moon-struck madness, or the dire effec&
Of incantation, charm, compulsive spell,
By magic faften'd on his wretched foul.
It can be nothing else.

ORMISINDA.

Whate'er it is,

He ihuns all woman-kind.' His life is spent
In war and in devotion.: When the field
Is won, the warrior lays.afide his spear,
Takes up the pilgrim's staff, and all alone,
Obfcur'd in homely weeds, he bends his course
To some remote, religious, holy place,
Where he exceeds the ftriEeft penitent,
In penances revere and fad auflerity.
Sometimes in deeper melancholy wrapt
He loaths the fight of man, and to the cliffs
Of hoary Caucasus or Atlas flies,
\Where all the dreary winter he remains,
And, desolate, delights in desolation.
My faithful servant Juan saw him once
Upon the ledge of Atlas; on a rock
Betide the empty channel of a brook,
He Rlood and gaz'd intent a cataract
Which, as it tumbled from a cliff, the blast
Had caught mid-way, and froze before it fell.
Juan drew near and call'd. He turn'd about,
Look'd at him for a space, then wav'd him back,
And mounting swiftly funk behind the hill.
Wan was his face, and like a statue pale!
His eye was wild and haggard! Oh! Teresa,
Amidst my woes, my miseries, my wrongs !
My bosom bleeds for him!

TERESA.

Something there is

Mysterious and unfathomable here,
Which passes human wisdom to divine.
The hand of fate is on the curtain now.
Within my breast a firm persuasion dwells,
That in the lifts Alonzo will appear.
Behold in haste the king your father comes,
And seems the messenger of welcome tidings.'

Enter the K I N G.

Ki IN G.

I come in this alarming hour, my child,
To pour a ray of comfort on thy heart.
A valiant Moor, once captive of my sword,
And ever since, my firm but secret friend,
Acquaints me that a champion is at hand,
Shunning those honors which the Moors would pay:
Dark and referv'd he travels thro' their towns
Without a name. I judge it is Alonzo,
For the description best accords with him.
Scorning his foes, offended with his friends,
Shrouded in anger and in deep disdain,
Like some prime planet in eclipse he moves,
Gaz'd at and sear'd.

ORMISINDA:

It is! It is Alonzo!

Welcome, most welcome, in whatever shape.
The hero comes to save his native land,
To save the honour of the Christian name,

And

And o'er the fading crescent of the Mode
Exalt the holy cross.

KING.

And, ev'n as thine

Is the consenting voice of all the land.
The hope of Spain on brave Alonzo refts.
In this I fee the ruling hand of heav'n,
Which to its own eternal purpose leads,
By winding paths, the tfeps of erring man!
Painful it were to speak of those events
Sad and disastrous which have laid us low.
Unjustly was Alonzo banifh'd hence,
And happily the hero now returns.
For since my son, your valiant brother, fell,
With an impartial mind I have enquir'd
And.trac'd the story of Alonzo's birth.
He is the offspring of our ancient kings,
The rightful heir of Riccaredo's line,
Called the Catholic, who reign'd in Spain
Before the firfr invasion of the Moors.
Loft in the gen'ral wreck, buried and hid
Beneath the ruins of a fallen slate,
Obscure, unknown, the royal infant lay,
When I, indignant of a foreign yoke,
In wild Afturia rose against the Moors.
The righteous cause prevail'd; the baffled foe
Retir'd, and left us and our mountains free.
The grateful people chose their leader king.

I knew

f knew not then, nor did my people know,
Ought of Alonzo.

ORMISINDA.

I have heard him own

The justice of thy title to command
And rule the state thy valor had reftor'd.
Enough, he said, remain'd for him to conquer:
The fertile provinces of ample Spain,
Which still the Moor usurps.

KING.

Of all mankind,

He is the champion whom my foul desires
This day to fight for Spain and for my daughter;
Not only for his great renown in arms,
But for his birth, his lineage, and his blood.
If his unconquer'd arm in fight prevails,
The antient monarchy miall rife again,
In all its splendor and extent of empire.
The streams of royal blood divided now,
Shall roll a tide united thro' the land.

ORMISINDA.

Thy heart dilates with pleasing hopes, my father!
And fond anticipates its own desire.
But who can tell the purpose of Alonzo ?
His strange approach no friendly aspec bears:
He comes the foe determin'd of the Moors,
But not to us a friend.

C

KING.

Of that no fear.

I know him proud, impetuous, and fierce,
Haughty of heart, and high of hand: Too prompt
On all occasions to appeal to arms.
But he was ever gentle to my daughter:
The proud Alonzo bow'd the knee to thee,
At his departure I obferv'd thy grief,
And in my mind----

(A tirumpet founds.)

ORMISINDA.
What means that shout of war ?

KING.
The trumpet founds to arms.

(Enter a imefenlger.)
MESSENGER.

Thy pretence, Sir,

Is at the camp requir'd. Both nations arm,
And rush to battle: Loud the Moors complain
Of violated faith. A Spanish knight
They fay has broke the treaty, and attack'd
Their bands, of peace secure.

KING.

'Tis basely done!

Command my guards to meet me at the gate.
Farevwe}.

[Exit the King.

TERESA.

Who can this headlong warrior be ?

Too well Alonzo knows the laws of war,
Too much reveres the treaty seal'd and sworn,
To make a rafl attempt'upon the Moors.

ORMISINDA.

If it is he, 'tis no deliberate act,
No treacherous intention to assail
The Moors unguarded. Yet it may be he:
My mind misgives me that it is Alonzo.
11 would his swelling spirit brook the fight
Of Moorifl tents and arms on yonder plain.
If as he pass'd, one fighting word was dropt,
With tenfold scorn to that he would reply,
Nor hesitate alone to draw his sword
Amidst an host of Moors.

TERESA.

The clamour finks.

Whate'er it was, the tumult is appeas'd.
And now what does my Ormifinda think
Of my predicions ?

ORMISINDA:

Oh! my dear Teresa!

Thy fond desire to chear my hopeless heart
Makes thee for ever to my mind present
The fairest fide of things.

C

TERESA.

Ha! dost thou doubt
Still of his coming ?

ORMISIND A.

No, I think 'tis he;

But hope and fear alternate sway my mind:
Like light and slade upon a waving field
Coursing each other, when the flying clouds
Now hide and now reveal the fun of heav'n.
I tremble for the issue of the combat;
And if my Lord should, as I hope, prevail,
I tremble for myself: Afraid to fee,
Tho' sick with strong impatience to behold him,
And learn why he forsook his Ormifinda.
He fays I know the cause. Oh ! most unjust
Was it because I lov'd him to excess,
Altho' his title shook my father's throne ?
Was it because I join'd my fate to his,,
And fondly chore to wed a banilh'd man
For such are my demerits.

TERESA.

'Tis but vain

Thus to torment thyself, and rack thy mind
With fad conjectures, at a time like this,
'When the reality will soon be known.

ORMISINDA.

I know one thing that's real, 'tis a fault,
An imperfeEion which I. cannot cure;

Eighteer

Eighteen long years are past since I beheld him,
And grief and care, those tenants that deface
The fad and dreary mansion they inhabit,
Have dwelt with me. Am I not alter'd much?
The ghost and ihadow of what once I was ?

TERESA.

No, Ormifinda, I perceive no change;
That in the least impairs thy lovely form.
The beam that gilds the early morn of youth
Yields to the fplkndor of a riper hour:
The rose that was so fair in bud, is blown;
And grief and care, tho' they have dwelt with thee,
Have left no traces of their visitation,
But an impreflion fwieet of melancholy
Which captivates the foul. Unflilful they
Who dress the queen of love in wanton smiles:
Brightest she flines' amidst a fliow'r of tears;
The graces that adorn her beauty most,
Are softness, sensibility, and pity.

ORMISINDA.

Oh ! how ingenious thou art, Teresa,
How subtle to elude my simple fears !
Still they advance and gather round my heart.
If nothing can recal Alonzo's love,
Let him but own his son, and I'll renounce
The title of his wife, and of a queen;
Then in a convent hide me and my sorrows.
The saddest sifter of the holy train,

Whose
2

Whose watchful zeal prevents the midnight bells
Shall find me kneeling on the marble floor.
Oh! it will be the luxury of grief,
To weep incessant in the vaulted cell,
To lift'my hands, and fend my vows to heav'n,
Invoking every power that dwells above,
To guard and bless my husband and my son !
Perhaps some friend, most likely my Teresa,
When I.am quite forsaken and forgot
By all the world, will still remember me;
Will come and tell me of Alonzo's wars;
Tell how my boy in his first battle fought,
At once the rival of his father's fame.

# ACT II.

ACT II,

SCENE I.
Enter the K ING and a lMociriJ officer, wit1b

Moors and Spaniards.

KING.
[AMET, impartial justice shall be done,

And thou I know as justly wilt report it;
Thou art the friend of peace.

HAMET.

Therefore I fought

This office; for in yonder camp, O ! King,
Some counsellors there are who urg'd the Caliph
To take advantage of this fair occasion
And hold the treaty void.

KING.

That I believe,

But with your aid I hope to disappoint them;
My guards are gone to bring th' offender hither.

HAMET.

Yonder they come, and thro' their files I fee
A prisoner.

[Eiltcr guards with a young mian armed.]

KING.

Ha ! by Heaven, he's but a youth,

A beardless boy, and like a woman fair.
I-e moves my pity much. Unhappy youth!

[To the prisoner.,

Art thou the chief of that unruly band,
Who broke the treaty and assail'd the Moors ?

YOUTH.

No chief, no leader of a band am I.
The leader of a band insulted me,
And those he led basely aflil'd my life;
With bad success indeed. If felf-defence
Be criminal, 0 King! I have offended.

KI N G. [To Hamet.]

With what a noble confidence he speaks!
See what a spirit through his blushes breaks !
Observe him, Hamet.

HAMET.

I am six'd upon him,

KING.

Didft thou alone engage a band of Moors
And make such havoc ? Sure it cannot be.
Recall thy scattered thoughts. Nothing advance
Which proof may overthrow,

YOUTH.

What I have said

No proof can overthrow. Where is the man,
Who speaking from himself, not from reports
And rumours idle, will sand forth and fay
I was not single when the Moors attack'd me ?

HA M. T.

I will not be that man, tho' I confess,
That I came hither to accuse thee, Youth !
And to demand thy punifliment.-I brought
The tale our soldiers told.

YOUTH.

The tale was false.

HAIMET.

I thought it true; but thou haft shook my faith.
The feal of truth is on thy gallant form,
For none but cowards lie.

KING.

Thy story tell,

With every circumstance which may explain
The teeming wonder; how a tingle man
In such a strife could stand ?

YOUTH.

'Twill cease to be

A wonder, when thou hear'st the story told.
This morning on my road to Oviedo

D A while

A while I halted near a Moorish post.
Of the commander I enquir'd my way,
And told my purpose, that I came to fee
The famous combat. With a scornful smile,
With taunting words and gestures he replied,
Mocking my youth. Advis'd me to return
Back to my father's house, and in the ring
To dance with boys and girls. He added too
That I should fee no combat. That no knight
Of Spain durst meet the champion of the Moors,
Incens'd I did indeed retort his scorn.
The quarrel grew apace, and I defied him,
To a green hill, which rose amidst the plain,
An arrow's flight or farther from his post.
Alone we sped: at once we drew, we fought.
The Moorilh captain fell. Enrag'd his men
Flew to revenge his death. Secure they came
Each with his utmost speed. Those who came first
Single I met and flew. More wary grown
The reft together join'd, and all at once
Afflail'd me. Then I had no hopes of life.
But suddenly a troop of Spaniards came
And charg'd my foes, who did not long fiftain
The shock, but fled, and carried to their camp
That false report which thou, 0 King! haft heard.

K IG.

Now by my sceptre, and my sword, I swear,
Thou art a noble youth. An angel's voice

4 óCould

Could not command a more implicit faith
Than thou from me haft gain'd. What think'ft

thou, Hamet?
Is he not greatly wrong'd ?

HAMET.

By Allah ! yes.

The voice of truth and innocence is bold,
And never yet could guilt that tone assume.
I take my leave impatient to return,
And satisfy my friends that this brave youth
Was not th' aggressor.

KING.

I expet& no leGs
From gen'rous Hamet.

[Exit Hamet and Moors.]

KING.

Tell me, wondrous Youth!

For much 1 long to know; what is thy name ?
Who are thy parents ? Since the Moor prevail'd,
The cottage and the cave have oft' conceal'd
From hostile hate the noblest blood of Spain;
Thy spirit speaks for thee. Thou art a shoot
Of omre illustrious tfock tsome noble house
Whose fortunes with their falling country fell;

YOUTH.

Alberto is my name. I draw my birth
From Catalonia; in the mountains there

D z My

My father dwells, and for his own domains
Pays tribute to the Moor. He was a soldier:
Oft3 I have heard him of your battles speak,
Of Cavadonga's and Olalles' field.
But ever since I can remember ought,
His chief employment and delight have been
To train me to the use and love of arms;
In martial exercise we past the day;
Morning and evening, still the theme was war.
He bred me to endure the summer's heat,
And brave the winter's cold : To swim across
The headlong torrent, when the shoals of ice
Drove down the stream. To rule the fiercest freed
That on our mountains run. No savage beast
The forest yields that I have not encounter'd.
Meanwhile my bosom beat for nobler game;
I long'd in arms to meet the foes of Spain.
Oft' I implor'd my father to permit me,
Before the truce was made, to join the host.
He said it muff not be, I was too younig
For. the rude service of these trying times.

KING:
Did he permit you now ?

ALBERTO.

A strange adventure

Forc'd me from home. Not many days ago,
When hunting in the woods, I heard a voice,

A woman's

A woman's voice, calling aloud for help.
I rulh'd into the thicket; there 1 saw
A Moorish Lord, for brutal licence fam'd,
Who shamefully abus'd a rural maid
Of Spanish race. I free'd her from his arms.
The Moor spake not a word, but mad with rage
Snatch'd up his lance, which flood against a tree,
And at me few. I turn'd his point aside,
And with a slender javelin pierc'd his heart.
I hasten'd home, but did not find my father ;
Nor was it safe to wait for his return.
I took the fairest armour in the hall,
And hither bent my course. The reft thou know'ft.

KING.

Thou art a prodigy, and'fill'ft my mind
With thoughts profound and expetation high.
When in a nation, humbled by the will
Of Providence, beneath an haughty foe,
A person rifes up, by nature rear'd,
Sublime, above the level of mankind;
Like that bright bow, the hand of the most High
Bends in the wat'ry cloud: He is the sign
Of profp'rous change and interposing Heav'n:
And thou, if right I read-

(Enter Meelnger.)
MESSENGER.

The champion, Sir,
Who comes to fight for Spain, is near at hand:

One

One of our scoutS has seen him and his train,
But brings a firange raport, which damps the heart
Of every Spaniard. It is not'Alonzo,

KING.

What fay'ft thou ? God of heaven! Not Alonzo!
Who is he then ?

MESSENGER.
That is not fully known.

Clad in the flowing vetture of the east,
A Persian turban on his head he wears,
Yet he's a christian knight. To mark his faiths
Holy, and adverse to Mohammed's law,
Before his steps a silken banner borne
Streams in the wind, and shews a golden cross,

KING,
Send out another scout.

MESSENGER.

There is not tinle
To go and to return.

KING.

Begone, begone,

And let me be obey'd. Alas! my hopes
Are vanifh'd like a dream. [Exit MeJeiageyr

ALBERTO.

I grieve to fee
The King affllted.

KING. - .

Ah! Thou dost not know
How deep these tidings strike.

ALBERTO.

Is not the King

Free to accept or to refute the aid-
This stranger offers ?

KIN G.

If I am, what then ?

ALBERTO.

Be not offended, Sir, at my presumption,
For from my heart I speak, a loyal heart,
True to my fov'reign and my native land.
If this is not Alonzo, why fnould he,
Or any stranger fight the cause of Spain ?
Are there not warriors born of Spanifi race,
Who court the combat?

KING.

To my words attend.

The Moorilh champion is of great renown;
In itature like the giant race of old,
Like Anak's true, or Titan's fabled sons,
Against the foe nor sword nor spear he lifts,
But in his might secure, a mace he wields,
Whose sway refialefs breaks both shield and arm,
And crushes head and helmet. Thus he fights,

7Nhofe

Whose fatal prowess turn'd the doubtful scale
Of three fuccelfive battles. He is deem'd
Invincible but by Alonz6's arm:
Therefore our warriors, tho' they know no fear,
No fear of ought that can themselves befal,
Anxious for Spain, to great Alonzo yield,
And on his valour reft.

ALBERTO.

Oft' have I heard

My father speak of brave Alonzo's deeds;
What can with-hold him when his country calls ?
Perhaps the last of combats he has fought,
And in the silent tomb the hero refts.
But, since he's absent, from whatever cause,
0 ! let no stranger knight his place assume,
To bring dishonour on the Spanifil name.
If this gigantic champion of the Moors,
Clad in the glory of his battles won,
Dazzles the warriors, and confounds their valour;
Let nme, tho' young in arms, the combat claim,
On me'his fame has no impreflion made.
I'll meet the giant with a fearless heart.
It beats for battle now. Oft' have I kill'd
The wolf, the boar, and the wild mountain bull,
For sport and pastime. Shall this Moorish dog
Rekfift me fighting in my country's cause ?

KING.
By heaven and earth, thou mov'fl me much ! thy

words

Have stirr'd the embers of my youthful fire.
Thou mak'ft me wish I could recal those days,
When of an age like thine, and not unlike
To thee in face and form, I rais'd the spear
Against the Moor, in Cava's bloody field.
Then by my hand the great Alchammon fell,
The strength and pillar of the Caliph's host.
Then I was fit to meet Mirmallon's arm.
But now, my hairs are gray, my steps are flow,
My sword descending breaks the hlield no more:
Our foes have known it long.

ALBERTO.

O ! King, thou art

Thy country's great deliv'rer, and the sole
Restorer of the iate. Pelagio's fame
Shall never die : But let thy counsel now
(As oft' thy valour) save this land from flame.
Let not a foreign warrior take the field,
And snatch the glory from the lance of Spain.

KING.

My voice alone cannot determine that.
The council fit assembled near the lifts,
To them I will present thee. If this knight
Unknown, who from that distant region comes,
Where the bright fun lights up his golden lamp,
Bears not some high pre-eminence about him,

E Which

Which marks him out our surest safest choices
My voice is for a Spaniard, and for thee!

ALBERTO.

Upon my knees, that ne'er were bow'd before
To mortal man, I thank thee!

KING.

Rife, Alberto !

To me ndothanks are due. A greater King,
The King of Kings, I deem hath chosen thee
To be the champion of his law divine
Against the Infidel.-if not for this,
For some great purpose sure thou art ordain'd.
Bred in the desert, and by heav'n endued
With force and valor marvellously great,
Conduted by a hand unseen, thyself
Not knowing whither, and this day pr6duc'd
Before the nations.

ALBERTO.

Ah ! my foul's on fire!

Should such a glorious destiny be mine !
May I intreat to go without delay?
I fear some gallant warrior may ftep forth
And claim the fight before me.

KING.

Stay, Sebastian,
And to my daughter tell what has befall'n.

[Exeunt King and Alberto.

(Manet SEBASTIAN.)

How many changes mark this awful day!
What must the Princess susser! Well I know
That flie above all others wish'd Alonzo.

Enter ORMISINDA and TERESA.

TERESA.

It is a false report. In times like these
The minds of men are credulous and weak:
To rumor's shifting blast they bow and bend,
Like corn of fender reed to every wind.
Thou know'ft that from the East Alonzo comes.
Might not the haity meflenger mistake
For him some turban'd warrior of his train ?

OR.M ISINDA.

0 ! good Sebastian, canst thou tell me ought ?
Is it Alonzo ?

SEBASTIAN.

If report speaks truth,
And so the King believes, 'tis not Alonzo.

ORMISINDA.
Then I am loft, Teresa.

TERESA.

Halt thou heard,
If not Alonzo, who this firanger is?

SEBASTIAN.

His garb bespeaks him native of the East.
But from whatever clime the warrior comes,

E z I hope,

I hope, my Princess! that he comes in vain,
Another warrior, and of Spanish race,
Now claims the combat for his native land.

ORMISINDA.
Of Spanish race! Who is this Knight of Spain ?

SEBASTIAN.

A wonder! never was his equal seen,
For daring valour and address in arms.
He has not yet attain'd the prime of youth,
His look partakes more of the boy than man,
But he hath vanquifh'd men. This day the Moors
Have felt his hand.

ORMISINDA.
Ha ! Is it he, Sebastian,
Who was the author of the late alarm ?

SEBASTIAN.
The fame.

ORMISINDA.
And whence does this young hero come ?

SEBASTIAN.

From Catalonia. In the deserts there
His fire, obscure, tho' once a warrior, dwells.

ORMISINDA.

From Catalonia! In the desert bred!
Teresa! All that's possible I fear:
What if this youth-

TERESA. [ao Ormii/,da.]

O ! think how many youths

Of Spanish race in Catalonia dwell.
Be recollected whilst I afl Sebaffian
A question that at once all doubt resolves.

[T'o Scajfian.]

Has this youth no name ? Haft thou not heard
How he is call'd ?

SEBASTIAN.

H-e calls himself Alberto.

ORMISIND A.
Mother of God!

TERESA. [To H'r.]

Beware !--The Princess grieves,

['7o Seb/faian.]

That Spain depriv'd of great Alonzo's aid,
Should reft her fafery on a stripling's arm.

ORMISINDA.

No judge of warriors or of combats I;
But sure this youth, tho' ne'er so brave and bold,
Of tender years, who has not reach'd his prime,
Is most unfit to cope with strong Mirmallon.

SEBASTI AN.

Heroes must not be judg'd by common rules.
Irregular like comets in their course,
Who can compute the period when they fline ?
Lady ! if thou had'st seen this gallant youth,
If thou had'st heard him, when oblig'd to ipeak,

In

In felf-defence, he told his wond'rous deeds,
As if he thought them nothing: Thy faint heart
Would from his fire have caught the flame of hope,
Tiou would'st, even as thy royal father did,
Bclieve he was created and ordain'd,
By Heav'n supreme, the champion of his country.

TERESA.

Sebastian, go, and find this gallant youth.
Tell him, the Princess, partial to the brave,
D)fires his pretence.

SEBASTIAN.

Gladly I obey.
[E:,it SEBASTIAN.]

ORMISINDA.

He's gone. Now I may speak. My son ! my son !
My hope, my comfort, in despair and death!
The only star in my dark sky that shone i
Must thy unhappy mother live to fee
Thy light extinguifh'd ? I will not permit
This most unequal combat. I'll proclaim
My fatal flory, and declare his birth.

TERESA.
Think what must follow. Absolute perdition !

OR MI SIND A.

Is not his death perdition ? Can he meet
The Moor and live ? How flould his tender youth
Reffil the giant, vwho has overthrown

5 Squadrons

Squadrons entire, and trampled on the necks
Of firmefl warriors ?

TERESA.

'Tis not yet decreed

That he lhall fight the Moor. The Itranger knight,
Who was at firfl mistaken for Alonzo,
Comes not so far, without a name in arms,
To gain the suffrage of the Peers of Spain,
When once that name is known.

ORMISINDA.

Teresa, no.

My fate has fill one even tenor held,
From bad to worse. When I had fram'd my mind
To one difatler, then a greater came.
I had made death familiar to my thoughts;
I could embrace the fpeare like a friend:
But itill I kept a corner of my heart
Safe and untouch'd. My dearest child was there:
Amidst the ruins of the wife and queen,
The mother flood secure. 0 thou Alonzo !
If yet thine eyes behold the light of day,
What sorrow and remorse must be thy portion,
When thou shalt hear-Now promise me, Terefay
That when my son and I are laid in dust,
(For each event accelerates our doom)
Thou wilt seek out and find this cruel man,
Tell him how Spain, the kingdom of his fathers,
By him deserted, was for ever lofi:

How

How his forsaken wife in honour died-
But that's not much--for me he will not moirn.
Then tell him of his son, to wring his heart !
Truly describe the boy ! how brave he was!
How beautiful! how from the cloud obscure
In which his careful mother had involv'd him,
He burfl the champion of his native land:
Then tell him how the springing hero fell
Beneath a stronger arm, fighting for Spain,
And for his mother; fighting with the foe
His father (hould have fought, and could have

vanquif'd !

TE R E S A.
Sebaffian comes.

Enter SEBASTIAN.

SEBASTIAN.

All is revers'd again:

The franger knight is for Abdallah known,
The Persian prince, Alonzo's chosen friend,
His only equal in the strife of arms.
To him the combat is decided.

OR MISINDA.

I know

His story well; he is the Sophy's son,
The eldest born and Persia's rightful heir;
But by his mother's zeal a Christian bred:
True to his faith, he loft his father's throne.
What fays he of Alonzo ?

SEBASTIAN.

Sent by him,

The brave Abdallah comes to fight for Spain.
They march'd together, from the falls of Nile
To Damietta. There a wound receiv'd
In Asia's wars broke out, and forc'd Alonzo,
Full of regret, in Egypt to remain.
His friend for him appears. The king, thy father,
With all his peers, in honour of the prince,
Go forth to meet him.

ORMISINDA.

-Haft thou seen Alberto?

SEBASTIAN.

I have, and told him what I had in charge;
Then hasten'd hither to report these tidings,
At which Alberto droops.

TERESA.

Return, I pray,

To my apartment guide the young Alberto.
The princess will be there. [Exit Sebastian.]

Did not I fay,

Alonzo never would abandon Spain ?
Abdallah comes to conqur: in his name.
Now I can read the characters of fate,
And fpcll the will of Heav'n. This boy of yours
Will win your husband back. When he beholds
The image of his valour so e;jprefs,
His heart will melt. The huiband and the father
Will ruth upon him with a flood of joy.

F

ORMISINDA.'

Is he not like him ? Mark his coming forth!
Behold Alonzo in his daring son!
Full of the spirit of his warlike fire,
His birth unknown, he felt his princely mind,
Advanced undaunted on the edge of war,
And claim'd the post of danger for his own.

TERESA.

A mother's tongue cannot exceed the truth
In praising him. There never was a prince,
Since old Iberia first excell'd in arms,
Broke out with so much lustre on mankind.
But in this interview with prudence check
The transport of affection from thy son.
Cautious conceal the secret of his birth.
Safet he is while to himself unknown.

ORMISINDA.

r-ow could his faithful guardian let him go?
Perhaps the brave Coftollo lives no more,

TERESA.
Alberto will inform thee.

ORMISIND A.

Not Alberto.;
Alonzo is his name. I go to meet him.

# ACT III.

ACT III.

SCENE I.
.d view of the country near the city.

Enter ABDALLAH.
0 ! C ITY ! once the feat of all I lov'd!

O ! hills and dales! haunts of my youthful

days!

0! scenes well known! unalter'd you remain.
But I approach you with an alter'd mind,
Hate what I lov'd, and loath what I defir'd,
Intolerable state ! My foul is void !
A chaos without form. Why, nature, why !
Art thou so watchful o'er the brutal tribes,
And yet so careless of the human race.
By certain inftinc beasts and birds discern
Their proper food: For them the fairest fruit
Untouch'd, if pois'nous, withers on the bough:
But man, by a fair outside, still deceiv'd,
And by his boasted reason more betray'd,
Gives the affecion of his foul to beauty,
Devours the deadly bane.

Enter VELASCO.

My Lord ! Thy people,
Where thou commanded'ft, halt, and wait thy

coming.

Fz

ABDALLAH.

'Tis well! I wish'd to speak with thee alone.
Velafco! tho' to thee but little known,
I did in part reveal my secret foul,
Told thee the feign'd Abdallah was Alonzo.
Further than that, thou haft not fought to know,
Tho' many a lonely hour we two have worn
On sea and shore, that some men would have thought
Most opportune.

VELASCO.

My Lord ! There are some men

Who having once been trusted with a little,
Avail themselves of that, some more to learn,
And penetrate the bosom of a friend,
Even with the wedge his easiness had furnifi'd-
Such men should not be trusted.

ABDALLAH.

True, Velafco!

But thou art not like them: I have obferv'd thee,
Warm in affetion, but in temper cool:
A steady judgment guides thee thro' the world.
Thy gen'rous mind pursues the path of honour,
Unbiafs'd and unmov'd.

VELASCO.

From early youth,

The chosen confident of my companions,
I never yet from perfidy betray'd,
From babling vanity, divulg'd a secret.

ABDALLAH.

I have a tale to tell, that will amaze,
Confound, and strike thee dumb. The deserts vast
Of Asia and of Africa have heard it.
The rocky cliffs of Caucasus and Atlas
Have echo'd my complaints: But never yet
The human ear receiv'd them. Thou hatt heard
Already more than ever mortal did.
Thou know'ft the princess ?

VELASCO.

Ormilinda!
ABDALLAH.

Her.

VELASCO.

Not many of the court have been more honour'd
With opportunities to know her worth;
And there is none who more her worth reveres.

ABDALLAH.

Her worth ! Thou may'st as well revere a fiend,
The blackest fiend, that dwells in burning hell,
Is not more opposite to all that's good
Than Ormifinda.

VELASCO.

What a strain is this ?

ABDALLAH.

'Tis true, by every high and holy name,
That binds a soldier's and a prince's vow:

I swear,

I swear, Velafco, fie's the vilest woman
That e'er difgrac'd her sex. The most abandon'd,
The hardieft, most determin'd in her vice,
That ever wrong'd a fond believing heart.

YELAS O.
Great God!

ABDALLAII.

You start and shudder like a man
Struck with a heavy blow.

VELASCO.

And so I am.

ABDALLAH.

And now you lift your eye-lids up and stare
With looks full of conjeaure and suspicion,
As if you doubted of my fober mind.
I am not mad, Velafco, tho' Sometimes
I have been near, yes, very near to madness;
By, that bad woman craz'd.

VELASCO.

O ! Would to heav'n !

That this affli&ing moment of my life
Were a delirious dream! Unreal all
That's heard and spoken now! But how, my Lord,
Art thou so much affected by her crimes?

Ar. ABDALLAH.
I am her husband.

VELASCO.
Heav'n for that be prais'd!

ABDALLAH.

How dar'ft thou thus profane the name of heav'n
And mock my misery ? Thou art mad, I think;
Thefrenzy which thou wifhcd'ft has come upon thee,
Beware, for if this extafy endures,
My sword secures thy silence.

VELASCO.

0 ! forgive me,

Noble Alonzo, royal, I should fay,
Doubly my master now. There's not a man,
Whose veins contain one drop of Spanish blood,
Who does not with thee wedded to the pi.incefs.
And for her virtue! Thou haft long been absent,
And know'ft not what an angel's life she leads!
Referv'd, retired, and fad. I'll stake my foul,
Some villain has belied thy faithful w;fe,
And fnar'd thy easy faith.

ABDALLAH.

Take heed, take heed I

I am the villain who accuse the princess,
And thou flalt be her judge.

VELASCO.

Eternal power;
What shall I think of this ?

ABDALLAH.

Lifen to me.

I have perplex'd thee, and have marr'd the fior!.
By my abrup;tneis. 'Tis a serious story,
Not to be told in parcels and by starts,
As I from impotence of mind began,
But I will bear my swelling pallion down,
And utter all my ihame. Thou dost remember
How I was banished from my native land?

VELASCO.
For killing young Ramirez.

ABDALLAH.

At that time

I doated on the princess. She conjur'd me
With earnest pray'rs, with deluges of tears
Not to resist her father, nor advance
My better title to the crown cf Spain,
As I had once refolv'd. My rage flle footh'd;
Pride, anger, int'recf, yielded all to love.
With her I made a merit of obedience,
And pleaded so efieCually my cause,
That she consented to a private marriage,
Before I left the kingdom. We were married,
And met together, four fuccefive nights,
In the feql.if'i-cd cottage of the wood,
Behind the palace garden. 0 ! I thought
Myself the happiest and the most bclov'd
Of all mankind. She mock'd me all the while;

5 Me.an

Meant me the cover of her loose amours,
A cloak to hide her shame. 0 God! 0 God!
Did I deserve no better ?

VELASCO,

Good my Lord!

What circumstance to warrant such conclusion ?
What evidence?

AB.DALLAH.

The evidence of fight-
Mine eyes beheld: I saw myself difhonour'd.

VELASCO.
Your eyes beheld!

ABDALLAH.

By Heav'n and Hell-they did.

The night preceding the appointed day
Of my departure from the realm of Spain,
I flew impatient to the place of meeting,
Before the hour was come: To wear away
The tedious time, for ev'ry minute feem'd
An age to me, I struck into the wood
And wander'd there, still steering to the gate
By which ihe was to enter. Thro' the trees
The moon full orb'd in all her glory shone.
My am'rous mind a sportful purpose form'd,
Unseen to watch the coming of my bride,
And wantonly furprize her. Near the gate
There stood an aged tree. It was a beech,
Which far and wide ftretch'd forth its level arms

G Low,

Low, near the ground, and form'd a-gloomy shade.
Behind-its trtik I took my secret stand;
The gate was full in view, and the green path
On which it open'd. There I stood a while,
And: oon I heard the turning of the key.
My heart beatthick with joy---and forth she came:-
Not as I wish'd: She had a minion with her;
A handsome youth was tripping by her fide,
Girt with a sword, and drefs'd in gay attire.
He feem'd to court her, as they pass'd along,
Coy, 'but not angry, for I heard her laugh;
She flung away. He follow'd, soon o'ertook her,
Embrac'd her-

VELASCO.
'Ah! The Princess Ormifinda!

ABD ALLAH.

I drew my sword, that I remember well,
And then an interval like death ensued.
When consciousness return'd, -I found myself
Stretch'd at my length upon the naked ground
Under the tree: My sword lay by my fide.
The fudden.fhock, the transport of my rage,
And grief, had ftopt the current of my blood,
And made a,paufe of life.

VELASCO.

Alas! my Lord!

'Twas piteous indeed. What did'ft thou do,
When ife and sense return'd ?

:5

ABDALLAH.

With life and sense,

My rage return'd. Stumbling with haste, I ran
To sacrifice them to my just revenge.
But whcsther they had heard my heavy fall,
Or that my death-like swoon had lasted long,
I know not, but I never saw them more.
I fearch'd till morning; then away I went,
Refolv'd to scorn the strumpet, and forget her.
But I have not been able to forget
Nor to despise her; tho' I hate her more
Than e'er I lov'd her, frill her image haunts me
Where'er I go. I think of nothing else
When I'm awake, and never flhut my eyes
But fie's the certain vision of my dream.
Sometimes, in all her loveliness the comes
Without her crimes: In extafy I wake,
And wifli the vision had endur'd for ever.
For these deceitful moments, 0! my friend
Are the sole pleasant moments which Alonzo
For eighteen years has known.

VELASC .

Within that time,

What regions barbarous haft thou explor'd,
What strange vicissitudes of life endur'd
In action and repose.

ABDALLAH.

Extremes of both
I courted to relieve my tortur'd mind:

G But

But the tormenter still my steps attends;
Behind me mounts, when thro' the ranks of war
I drive my fiery steed; and when I seek
The hermit's cell, the fiend pursues me there.
Time, which they fay the wounds of palfion cures
In other hearts, inflames and feflers mine.
There's but one remedy.

VELASCO.

Would I could name one !

ABDALLAH.

HIer life. The unEtion for the serpent's bite
Is the fell serpent's blood. I'll have her life.
Th' adulteress with infamy flall die,
By public jufticedoom'd. With this intent
Difguis'd'I come. If in my proper shape
I had appear'd, alarm'd fie would have fled,
And baffled my revenge.

VELASCO.

My Lord, permit me

One thing to mention, which there eyes beheld,
Altho' it squares not just with thy opinion,

ABDALLAH.
Opinion !

VELASCO.

Good my Lord! with patience hear.

When first I was to this employment nam'd,
Which since I have so happily difcharg'd,
The Princess sent and call'd me to her presence.

The

The treaty with the Moor engrofs'd her thoughts,
That fad and pensive air she always wears
Was fettled to a thicker gloom of grief.
Her voice was low and languid. Few her words,
And the (hort periods ended with a igh.
But when I gave her hopes of thy return, .
A sudden gleam of joy spread o'er her face,
Like morning breaking in a cloudy sky.
With earnest voice, f-ill riling as fle spoke,
She urg'd dispatch, exhorted me to zeal
And perseverance. Never to defifl
Till I had found thee: For her fate, she said,
The fate of Spain, depended on Alonzo.
Her paflion then burfr in a flood of tears
That choak'd her utterance.

ABDALLAH.

And thou didlt believe

That ev'ry word (le spoke was most sincere.
How to interpret her let me inftruc thee.
Whate'er (he utters witli unusual warmth,
As the effusion genuine of her heart,
Receive and construe in another sense
Reverse and opposite; for that's the truth.
The words flie spoke, her sighs, the tears fie flied,
Were all from apprehension of my coming,
Not as they feem'd, for fear I should not come.

VELASCO.
'Tis dreadful that.

A B DA LL-AH.

'Tis horrible, 'tis monfirous !

When I for her had wav'd my right to reign,
The right undoubted of the Gothic line,
And ftoop'd, enamour'd, to that base decree
From Spain, which banifi'd the true heir of Spain,
That she Ihould pitch on me to be her fool,
And pour such infinite contempt upon me.
But four days married ! Fond, to madness fond !
And on the very eve of my departure i
She would not for a single day refrain,
But rulh'd to proflitution !

VELASCO.

I have heard

Stories and tales enough of female falfhood,
Some that were true, and others that were feign'.d,
By spiteful wits maliciously devis'd.
But this surpasses all.

ABDALLAH.

All wicked women

Compar'd with her arc faints. She is a foil
To set them off, and make their foulness fair.
In her incontinence she stands unrivall'd,
Burning in fires peculiar to herself,
I'hcenix in lewdness.

VELASCO.

May I ask my Lord
lIow he intends ?-But fee, the King draws near.

ABD ALLAH.
He's much impair'd.

VELASCO.

When fore affliction comes.

In the decline of life! 'tis like a storm
Which in the rear of autumn hakes the tree
That frost had touch'd before; and :strips it bare
Of all its leaves.

(Enter the KING with attendants.)
(As he advances, speaks to V EL ASC O.)

KING.

We thank thy care, Velafco!

To ABDALLAH.

Illustrious Prince! whom love of glory brings
From regions so remote, to fight for Spain,
Accept the thanks a grateful nation pays
To her defender.

ABDALLAH.

Monarch of Alturia

The nations of the East have heard thy praise.
Had not the hand of time unstrung thine arm,
Spain never would have fought for foreign aid
To quell her-foes.

KING.

'Tis better far for Spain

That I am old: For in my warlike days,
When in the prime of flow'ring youth I fought,
I equall'd not thy friend. Above his own,

Above

Above the strength of ev'ry mortal arm
Alonzo thine exalts.

ABDALLAH.

Three times we fought

With equal fortune on the Wolga's banks;
He for.the Monguls, I against them stood.
But at our last encounter, on my helm
His faithless blade broke short, and in his hand
The useless hilt remain'd. My sword I dropt,
And in my arms the valiant chief embrac'd.
Our friendlhip thus commenc'd, and since that time
We have been brothers sworn, and leagu'd in arms.
Alonzo, fighting in my cause, receiv'd
That wound which now detains him from the field.
Urg'd by affetion, and by honour bound,
For him I come against the foes of Spain.
But of myself more than enough is said;
'Tis time to a&. The Moorish knight, I hear,
Is in the lifts already.

KING.

Prince of Persia!
The terms to thee are known.

ABDALLAH.

The firr of men

With pride such honors might from Spain receive;
But never can these honors grace Abdallah.
Long since my heart and hand were giv'n away;
And tho' the cultom of the East permits
Innumber'd consorts, me my faith restrains.

But

But if victorious in the strife of death,
I have an earnest and a just request
To thee, O King! which, at a proper time,
I llall be bold to make.

KING.

Whate'er it is,
I pledge my honor and my faith, to grant it,

Elter SEBASTIAN and AI.BERTO.
(A L B E R T goes Oi t the KING.)

KING.

Advance, Alberto! to the Prince himself,
Deliver thou thy meffilge and the present.

ALBERTO.

Great Sir ! the Princess Ormifinda greets
The gen'rous champion of her country's cause,
Willes that victory may fit to day,
And ev'ry day of battle, on his sword.
This cosily bracelet from her arm she fends
To prince Abdallah, to Alonzo's friend.

A B D A L LA H.

(Looking fteftJi on A L B E R T .)

The Princess is most bountiful, as thou,
Who haft the honor to attend her, know'ft.
Her gracious present humbly I accept,
And thank her for her goodness to Alonzo,
Who will be proud to be by her remember'd,
The combat ended, I propose to pay
My homage to her beauty. At this time

HI My

My mind is in the lifts.-The Moorilh knight
Will think me tardy. (To the K i N G.)

KING.

Let our trumpets found

A sprightly charge. The warrior's heart beats time
To that brave music. Onward from this place
A path direct to thy pavilion leads.

(The KI NG trilts and gives orders.)

ABDALLAH (toVELASCO.)

Another minion ! View him well, Velafco.
How insolent! See what a crest he rears,
Elated with her favour. 0 ! vile woman!
Insatiate and inconstant.

VELASCO.

Ah ! my Lord!

Truce with such thoughts! Sure this is not a time !
The combat claims a cool and present mind.

ABDALLAH.
Fear not the combar.

V ELASCO.

Thou art waited for;
The King himself intends with thee to walk.

[Exelunt: Abdallah lookiii back at Alberto.]

(Mannlt ALEERTO, SEBASTIAN.)

ALBERTO.

That Prince of Persia is compos'd of pride;
He did not deign to look upon the present,

But

But ftrctch'd his sun-burnt hand straight out before

him,

Like a blind man, and would have flood so still,
Had I not made his fingers feel the pearls.
And all the while he ftar'd me in the face,
As if he meant t'opprefs me with his eye,
And fright me with his fierce and uncouth looks.
I blufl'd at first, but anger came at lart,
And bore me up.

SEBASTIAN.

Those princes of the East,

Us'd to the servile manners of their country,
Where ev'ry prostrate slave adores his lord,
Without intention shock the sons of Europe.

ALBERTO.

O! how unlike to him the King of Spain,
And that most gentle Princess, Ormifinda!
Her look, her voice, benign and mild, dispel
The awe her rank inspires, and reaflure
The modetl mind. Would'It thou believe, Sebastian,
She talk'd to me, I cannot tell how long,
Before thou cam'ft, and queftion'd me minutely
How I had liv'd, how past my youthful days ?
I fear I was too copious in my answers.
What signifies my rural life to her ?
And yet file feein'd to liften with delight,
As if she had an int'reiR in my fate;
And once or twice when I of danger spoke,

H 2 From

From which I hardly had efcap'd with life,
Methought I saw her tremble. Much she blam'd
My rashness; yet she prais'd my courage too.
With all her tenderness of heart, I fee
That fle admires true valour.

SEBASTIAN.

So she does.

The bravest knight that e'er was clad in steel,
Alonzo, was the lover of her youth:
And since he left this land she ne'er rejoic'd.
But of these matters I will tell thee more
At a convenient season. Let us follow,
And join the train before they reach the lifts.

ALBERTO.

I would not lose one moment of this fight
For half the lands of Spain. Tho' I abhor
The Persian, yet I pray devoutly for him.

ACT IV.

SCENE I.

Tbte City.
Einlr ORAISINDA and TERESA.

ORMISINDA.
T HI S city looks as if a pestilence

Had swept the whole inhabitants away.

The solitary fireets, the empty squares,
Appall me more than the deserted palace.
Let us go back again.

TERESA.

'Tis time we fllould.

You tremble at the howling of a dog,
That broke the silence and increas'd the horror.
If we flay here we fliall be fancy-ftruck,
Mistake some statue for a pale-fac'd ghost,
And think it beckons with its marble arm.

ORMISINDA.

Why should this deoblation frighten me ?
Why liouldl I fear to fee a grave-clad ghofl,
Who may so soon be number'd with the dead,
And be myself a ghost ? What noise is that ?
Pid'ft thou not hear, Teresa ?

TERESA.

Yes, I did.
I heard an uncouth found.

ORMISINDA.

Uncouth indeed!
An universal groan ! Hark! there again.

TERESA.

'Tis not the fame. This has another tone,
A ihout of triumph, and a burf of joy.

ORMISIND A.

The combat's over, and my fate's determii'd.
Now death or life!

[The trum;pets folld.]

TERESA.

Long may the Princess live!

And every hour be fortunate as this!
The Spanish trumpets found, the sign I know
Thy champion has prevail'd.

ORMISINDA.

O gracious Heav'n!
The lifts are near, and we flall quickly learn.

TERESA.

Look yonder, flying swifter than the wind,
A horseman comes; now at the gate he lights,
And hates across the square. It is Sebastian.
His look, his gesture, speak his tidings good.

[Ent;e SEBASTIAN.]

SEBASTIAN.

Joy to the Princess ! Vitory and.peace!
The Moor is slain by brave Abdallah's hand.

ORMISINDA.

Blest be thy tongue, Sebastian! Thou shalt find
Some better recompence than barren thanks
For these glad tidings. But the gen'rous Prince
Who fought for Spain-

SEBASTIAN.

Safe and without a wound,

Frelh for another foe, Abdallah stands.
Short was the combat: Soon the boaster fell,
Who durst defy the Christian world to arms.

ORMISINDA.

The God of battles, whom Abdallah serves,
Has overthrown the infidel, whose trust
Was in his own right arm.

SEBASTIAN.

If I should live

Ten thousand years, I never could forget
The solemn prelude and the fierce encounter.
Thou know'ft the place appointed for the combat,
An amphitheatre by nature form'd.

ORMISINDA.
I know it well.

SEBASTIAN.
The hills, of various slope
And flape, which circle round the spacious plain,

AI~~ Were

Were cover'd with a multitude immense
Of either sex, of every age and rank,
Christian and Moor; whole faces and attire
Strangely diversified the living scene.
Within the lifts a gallery was rais'd
In which thy father and the Moorith prince
Sate with their peers, the judges of the field.
To them the knights with flow and itately pace
Approach'd; and bound by sacred oaths declar'd
That they no charm nor incantation us'd,
But trusted in their valour and their arms.
With low obeisance then they both fell back;
And firfl the Moor (for he the challenge gave)
March'd to the middle of the lilted field;
There seiz'd his ponderous mace, beneath whose

weight,

ThIe brawny bearer bow'd ; and round his head,
Like a light foil, he flourifh'd it in air.
On him with difl'rent thoughts the nations gaz'd.
But il(ddtenly a flafl of light and flame
S:ruck ev'ry eye from brave Abdallah's flield,
Covcr'd till then. 'Twas made of polilh'd steel,
Whlich fnone like adamant; and to a point
Rose in the centre, slanting on each lide.
This shield the Persian Prince advancing bore
On his left arm outifretch'd, and in his right,
Thrown back a little, gleam'd a pointed sword.
Erect and high the bold Mirmalloln Itood,
And sternly cy'd his near-approaching foe.
They forward sprung, and on the flaming shield
Difcharg'd a mighty blow, enough to crush

A wall,

A wall,' or split a rock. The Spaniards gave
A general groan.

ORMISINDA.

That was the dreadful found
We heard, Teresa.

SE BASTIAN.
Glancing from the fiield,

Aside the mace descended. Then enrag'd,
Once more the Moor his thund'ring weapon rear'd.
In ftept the Prince, and raising high his shield,
Midway he met the blow; and with the strength
And vigour of his arm, obliquely down
The pond'rous mace he drove. Then quick as

thought,

His better hand and foot at once advancing,
Plung'd in Mirmallon's throat his thirsty blade.
The giant ftagger'd for a little space;
Then falling, shook the earth. The Christians rais'd
A Ihout that rent the air. Away I came,
Happy to be the bearer of such tidings.

[Trunp et.

ORMTISINDA.

Behold, they come in triumph from the field.
0 ! glorious man'! And yet forgive me, Heav'n,
I grudge the conquest to Alonzo's friend,
And with Alonzo in Abdallah's place.

Enter the KING, ABDALLAH, VELASCO,

ALBERTO, &C.

ABDALLA H. [co 'elaf/co.]
See where she stands. 0 Heavens!

I

VELASCO.

My Lord Alonzo,
Compose thy thoughts.

ABDALLAH.
Behold her how fle looks,

As if fie knew no ill. That harden'd heart
Against remorre and fear and shame is arm'd;
But I shall wring it now.

KING.
Daughter, draw near!

This godlike Prince all recompence diSclaims,
Save thanks from Spain. 'The pleasing task be thine
To greet the saviour of thy native land,
And speak our gratitude.

ORMISINDA.

No words can speak

The gratitude I feel. Believe it great
As my deliverance, vast as my dillrefs!
Like fad A ndromda, chain'd to the rock
I fiood a living prey, when this brave Prince,
Came like another ',Perleus fiom tie s<ky,
And fav'd mc from deftrucion. I forget,
YWrapt in imyfelf, the charge my father gave
To thr.nk the favicur of my native land;
Another voice m1al! give thee thanks ior Spain,
Alonzo's voice fii;ll thank thee for his country,
Hiis friends, his people-fav'd.

A B D A L LA H.

Ah! If I har (.i£de.)
T! is .fyrcn longer, sh;e vill cha.rm my rage;

But

But I remember where I heard her last.
Princess of. Spain! I merit not thy praise.
Sent by Alonzo to this land I came:
What has been done, for Hi-m I have perform'd,
Now of his promise I remind the Kinn
To grant me one request.

KING.

Speak! It is granted.

ORMISINDA.

If I conjecture right, even that request
Will prove one favour more on Spain conferr'd,

ABDALLAIH.
Perhaps it may.

KING.

Proceed, illutlrious Prince
And make me happy to fulfil thy wifli.

A D A LLAII.

Not for myfclf I speak, but for my friend
And in his name, whose person I fiuftain,
I aflk for justice on a great offender.

KING.

Thou flalt have ample and immediate justice.
Nor favour nor affinity shall ifrecn
The guilty person. Prince, why art thou troubled
Thou fliak'ft from head to foot. Thy quiv'ring lip
Is pale with palion. On thy forehead stand
Big drops. Almighty God ! What dreadful birth
Do these strong pangs portend ?

12

ABDALLAH.

The guilty person,

Whom with a capital offence I charge,
Stands by thy fide.

KING.

My daughter!
ABDALLAIH.

Yes ! thy daughter!

'Tis her I mean, the Princess Ormifinda.
Here in the presence of the Peers of Spain,
I charge her with a crime, whose doom the laws
Of Spain have wrote in blood : Adultery.
I read astonishment in ev'ry face !
Who would fuiped& that one so highly born,
With ev'ry outward mark of virtue grac'd,
Had giv'n her honour to a worthless wretch,
And driv'n a noble husband to despair!

KING.

Am I awake ! Is this the light of day ?
Art thou, O ! Prince, with iidden frenzy seiz'd ?
Or is the madness mine ? Renown'd Abdallah !
What answer can be made to such a charge ?
This strange demand ofjuftice on my daughter,
For an offence that fle could not commit ?
My daughter ne'er was married.

ABDALLAH.

Ask her that?
Hear if fle will deny file has a husband ?

KING.
My child, thou art amaz'd !

ORMISIND A.

No, not so much

As thou wilt be, my father, when thou hear'st
Thy daughter's tongue confess fle has a husband.

IKING.

Hart thou a husband ! God of heav'n and earth !
Since thou hafl thus dissemblcd with thy father,
Perhaps thou haft deceiv'd thy hulband too.
Who is thy husband ? Speak !

ORMISIN DA.

The Prince Alonzo.

KING.

And haft thou been so long in secret wedded ?
'Tis eighteen years since he departed hence.

ORMISIN DA.

O ! I have reason to remember that.
There is no calendar so just and true
As the fad mem'ry of a wife forsaken.
'[The years, the months, the weeks, the very days,
Are reckon'd, regifter'd, recorded there 1
And of that period I could cite such times,
So dolorous, distressful, melancholy,
That the bare mention of them would excite
Amazement how I live to tell the tale.
But I forget the present in the past.
No wonder, for this moment is the first
That opes the sluices of a heart o'ercharg'd,

And

And burfiing with a flood of grief conceal'd,
But I muRt turn me to another theme.
The earneRs eyes of all are bent on me,
Watching my looks, and prying to discern
Symptoms of innocence or signs of guilt.
i-lear then the frank confession of my foul
I have tranfg'efs'l.

I N G.
Stain of a noble race !
Dost thou avow thy crime ?

OR MI SI N DA.

Mistake me not,

I have tranfgrefs'd my duty to my father:
Without his knovwlc(ge, and against his will,
Mov'd by a tender lover's parting tears,
I join'd mylilf in wedlock to Alonzo.
My King, my father, pardon the ofience,
Which aiainti thee I own I have committed:
But may I ne'er of God or man be pardon'd,
Nor friend nor father ever pity me,
If I have fwerv'd one Psep from virtue's path,
Or broke the smallest parcel of that vow
Which binds a faithful wife! O ! Prince of Persia!
Thou art the befc of friends and benefacors
Thou com'ft to end my mool diftra&cing woes,
And to dispel th' impenetrable cloud
That darken'd all my days. Now I shall know
Why I have been abandon'd and forsaken,
Why I have been detested and defpis'd,

As

As never woman was. Proceed, my Lord.
And whilst thou keenly dost assail my life,
And, dearer far, my honor and my fame,
Secure in innocence, I'll calmly hear.
From thee, I hope, the end of all my cares.

ABDALLAH.

Even thus Alonzo told me fle would speak,
And thus proclaim her innocence.

ORMISINDA.

Did He ?

O ! would to Heav'n Alonzo heard me now,
Fearless defend his honor and my own !
My voice, which once was music to his ear,
Like David's harp which footh'd the gloomy king,
Would charm his malady, would drive away
The evil spirit, and call back again
The better genius of his early days.
O ! thou that wert so good, so great ! admir'd
Of all mankind ! my lov'd, my loft Alonzo!
For thee, in this humiliating hour,
More than myielf I mourn.

A B'D ALLAH. (Ha.s anid,.)

Eternal Power!

To whom the secrets of all hearts are known !
Hear, hear this woman, and between us judge !
'Tis not my business to contend with words,
These are the conquering arms of womankind.
A nobler course of trial lies before me:
In a wrong'd husband's name I charge this lady
-Vith infidelity ; and crave the doom

i Of

Of law upon her head. If any knight,
Spaniard or ifranger, dares assert her cause,
Let him stand fort!;, and take my gauntlet up;
Which on the ground i throw, my gage to prove
That file is false to honor ani Alonzo.

OR MIl I ND A.

Before the gage of death is lifted up,
HIcar me one moment. By A\cnzo Itnt,
Thou com'fc inftlucted in Alonzo's wrongs.
Let me co!nure thee then, by all that's dear,
By all that's i-cred to the great and brave,
Thy mother's memory, thy consort's fame,
Not on a gen'ral charge, obscure and vague,
To whicll there is no anfver but denial,
To found the claim of combat: Single out
What circumfiance thou wilt of special note,
Of such a kind as may be tried and known
For true or falle. Tell us at least his name
With whom Alonzo's wife her honor ftain'd,
And let us be confrontcd.

[iciwr? g ALnERTO Jfips so rt.
ALDERTO .

Heaven forbid

That thou should's be confronted with a villain.
Princess of Spain! Be sure lome wretch there is,
Some renegado, fallc to God and man,
Suborn'd, and ready with a lying tongue,
To second this brave Prince who wrongs thy fame,
And wounds thy modest ear. Too much by far
Already thou haft heard. Pretended Prince

For

For there is nothing royal in thy foul i
Thou base defamer of a lady's name!
I take thy gauntlet up, and hold it high
In scorn, and fierce defiance, to thy face,
My gage to prove thy accusation false,
And thee, the author of a tale invented
To rob a noble lady of her fame.

ORMISIN D A.
Where am I now ? What lhall I do, Teresa ?

TERESA.
The God of heaven direct thee!

AB D ALLAH.

Boy! To thee

I answer nothing. I suspect the cause
Of thy presumption, and could wish that Spain
I-ad giv'n a worthier victim to my sword.

[Walks a/dc.

ORMISINDA.

O ! valiant youth! much am I bound to thee:
But I have reasons that import the Rate,
Which shall, whatever is my fate, be known,
And own'd hereafter to be great and weighty,
Why I decline th' aliifance of thy sword.
If this appeal to combat is the law,
And I can find no champion but Alberto,
Without the chance of combat let me fall,
For I will not accept---

K

ALBE RTO.

Recall these words,.

Too gen'rous Princess ! I can read thy thoughts:
Thou think'ft my youth unequal to the foe;
Thou fear'ft the weakness of Alberto's arm.
My itrength exceeds the promilE of my years.
Cft' have I bent the bow, and drawn the sword,
Nor fly my fiafts, nor, falls my sword in vain.
This day against a troop alone I fought
But never did I fight in such a caule,
Nor was I e'er so certain to prevail.
A fire divine invades my zealous breast:
I feel the force of legions in mine arm.
Thy innocence has made thy champion strong !
The God of battle is our righteous judge;
And let the cause be tried.
(. war,';'ior ai;-.icl;, w:sthl his luiic o, fit s forth.)

\W' A RRIOR.

But not by tlhe !

Thy father's voice forbids, too daring youth;
Stand back, and let thy master in the art
Of war, now claim the combat for his own.
My liege !

KING.

That voice I know: Thy figure too

Resembles much a chief, lamented long
As slain in battle.

WARRIOR.

I am he, Coflollo.

'Tis true, 0 ! King ! that on the field 1 fell,
Fighting for Spain. How I was fav'd fiom death,
And where, for many years I have remain'd,
This is no time to tell. This hour demands
A soldier's speech, brief prologue to his deeds.
On me, proud Persian! turn thy gloomy eyes,
Hear me, and let thy ready sword reply.
With hel-born malice, level'd at her life,
Thou hair dcarnm' a Princess, honour'd, lov'd,
By all, who virtue or fair honour love.
The fell HI-lena, native of thy land,
Has not a voice or heart more false than thine,
Thou counterfeit of truth ! whom I defy
To mortal combat, and the proof of arms.
Thy full-blown fame, thy unexhaufted firength,
Deceitful confidence, I laugh to scorn
The conquering cause is mine.

ALB ERTO.

My lord, the King!

And ye his counsellors for wiflIom fam'd !
You will not sure permit this good old man,
By fond afi&itlon for his son impell'd,
To meet fl item a foe. -lis hoary head,
His wither'd veins, are symptoms of decay.
Lean not upon a reed which time hath bruis'd,
Nor trull the life and honour of the Princess
To the weak arm of age.

K 2

ABDALLAH.

I'll fight you both,

Father and son at once. Together come,
Tongue-valiant men ! and try Abdallah's arm.
I'll have it so; for both of you have dar'd,
Ignoble as you are, to match yourselves
Againrt a Prince who moves not in your sphere,
And utter words for which such blood as yours
Is poor atonement.

COSTOLLO.

Ev'ry word thou fpeak'ft

Is insolent and false. Son of a slave !
For eaitcrn monarchs buy with gold their brides,
The blood by thee delpis'd, flows from a Iource
Purer than thine and nobler.

ALBERTC.

Nay, my father!

That's said too far. Fierce and diidainful Prince,
Vain is the offer which thy paflion makes.
Perhaps the conqueror of the Moor may find
One Spaniard is enough.

COSTOLLO.

A father's right

Unmov'd I claim, and with determin'd voice.
Forbid the combat.

KING.

Hence let us retire

To the pavilion. There our peers flall judge
Of your pretensions.

My thoughts are of my son. Mine own estate
Is defp'rate. The huiband whom I lov'd,
On whom I doted, and from whom I fuffer'd,
What never woman with such patience bore,
Conspires against my honour and my life.
Long cherilh'd hope, farewel !

TERESA.

To guard thy son

Defend thyself; and, to prevent the combat,
In thy demand persist. Call the accuser
To circumltance of proof. That is the thread
To lead us thro' this labyrinth perplex'd.
Nor has the Pcrfian thy demand refus'd.

ORMISINDA.

He had not time to speak. Alberto's voice
Broke in like thunder in his mother's cause.

- Far from this place in Catalonia bred,

He came to fee the famous combat fought.
'Twas he, my Lord, who flew the Moorifl chief,
And in hi s own defence iuchl wonders wrought.
That action to the Princess made hiim known,
The reft in honour of his valour follow'd.

AD ALLAH.
H-ow dost thou know ?

With admiration struck,

When he stood forth and brav'd a foe, like thee,
Of divers persons curious I enquir'd,
Who, and from whence he was.

To hurt the stripling. 'Tis a noble boy.

Above all mortal men. Spare this young plant,
Who makes so fair a sloot.

Should their eletion fend him to my sword,
How, good Velafco ?

When the peers return,

The King, the Princess, with their champion chosen,
Then to the wond'ring audience, in the fLcc
Of her that's guilty, let my Lord relate
The truth-mark'd story he to me has told.
Detected thus, confounded and furpris'd,
Pierc'd with a thousand eyes, that gaze upon her,
And dart conviction; can fle still deny,
And by denial, male her guilt ambiguous ?
But if her sex's genius is so ifrong,
That flhe the port of innocence maintains,
And, from the fulness and excess of vice,
Derives a boldness, that may look like virtue;
Then let the sword decide.

ABDALLAH.

What you propose

Is worth the trial. I am loth to spill
The young Alberto's or Cofollo's blood:

For they deserve no harm. Ev'n you, my friend,
Before my hand unclafp'd the book of ltame,

I will adopt the counsel of Velafco,
And probe more deeply still her fcfter'd mind.

Her guilt, than with her vanquifh'dc champion fall,
By doom of law, protesting to the last
Her innocence.

ALBERTO.

Before the trumpet's voice unflheaths the sword
Which one of us flall never fleath again,
Permit me, Prince of Persia, to intreat
A moment's audience. Not from fear I speak.
The cause I fight for, and the mind I bear,
Exalt me far above the thoughts of danger;
But from a conscious sense of what is due
To thee, renown'd Abdallah. In the heat
Of our contention, if my tongue has utter'd
One word ofienfive to thy noble ear,
Which might have been omitted, and the tone
Of firm defiance equally preferv'd;
For that I aflc forgiveness.

ABDALLAH.

Less I mark'd

The manner than the matter of thy speech:
If thou dost need forgiveness, freely take it.

KING.

'Tvws generoufy ask'd, and nobly granted:
Such courtesy with x alour ever dwells.
Let me too crave for a few words thine ear.
Throughout the trying bus'nefs of this day,
Thou art my witness, that my mind upright
Has never been by pow'rful nature bent,
Nor fway'd to favour and opinion form'd,
By long habitual and accuftom'd love:
But I with equal hand the balance held
Between thee and my child.

ABDALLAH.

Thou haft indeed.
It is but justice that I should declare it.

KING.

Then to thy candour let me now appeal,
And beg of thee to grant me one request,
Which I do not, but might perhaps, command,

ABDALLAH.
What is it ?

KING.'

I have fearch'd my hapless child,

Ev'n to the pith and marrow of her foul,
Have touch'd her to the quick. She never flrinks
Nor wavers in the leafd. Perhaps, my Lord !
Some fool officious, or some wretch that's worse,
(If there is ought comes between man and wire
That's more pernicious than a medling fooi)
Some false designing friend has vwrong'd her fame,
And pour'd his poilbn in Alonzo's ear.
If thou wilt give fomie scope to her defence,
And bring the charge from darkness into light,
Then (he shall forthwith answer on the spot
Where now the stands before us.

To clear my fame ev'n in Abdallah's fight;
If but one dark fuifpicious speck remains
To make mine honour dim, let me be held

IHaft thou no other witness than thyself ?

ALONZO.
I have no other, and none else require.

KING.

Unfeeling man, to trifle with our sorrows,
And like a pageant play a mimic scene:
This is thy hatred of Pelagio's house,
Thy passion to confound a rival race.
Would I were young again!

ALBERTO. [To Alonzo.]

Defend thyfeif.
I can no longer hold me from thy breast.

PELAGIO.

ORMISINDA;
Hold! Strike thro' me!

You know not what you do, unhappy both!
This combat muff not, nor it flall not be.
The Sun in Heav'n would backward turn his course,
And shrink from such a spectacle as this,
More horrid than the banquet of Thyestes.
You have no quarrel. I'll remove the cause.
A Roman matron, to redeem her fame,
Before her husband's and her father's eyes
Plung'd in her breast the steel.

My dying voice ! my latest words believe,
Whole truth my blood hath seal'd: I'm innocent;

Where I ffiall soon appear, I never wrong'd thee,
When that is manifest, remember me
As love like mine dcferv'd, and to this youth,

And gave in secret to Coftollo's care.

To rufl between your swords, would let me live,
