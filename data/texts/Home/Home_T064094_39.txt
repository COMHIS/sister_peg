:~ tnhe.e.weeds of woe.! fay, d.'fttbou ei

To feed a pallion which confumes-thy life?
The living claim some duty; vainly thou
Beftow'ft thy cares upon the silent dead.

La. Rand. Silent, alas! is he for whom I mournm:

Childless, without memorial of his name,
He only now in my remembrance lives.
This fatal day flirs my time-fettled sorrow,
Troubles afreh the fountain of my heart.

L. Rand. When was it pure of sadness! These black

weeds

Express the wonted cplour of thy mind,
For ever dark and difmali. Seven long years
Are pass'd, fmce we were join'd by sacred ties:
Clouds, all the while, have hung upon thy brow,.
Nor broke, nor parted by one gleam of joy.
Time, that wears out the trace of deepest anguish,
As the sea smooths the prints made in the sand,
Has pafl o'er thee in vain. -

La. Rand. If time to come'

Should prove as ineffeaual, yet, my Lord,
Thou canst not blame me. When our Scottish youth;
Vdy'd with each other for my luckless love,
Oft I besought them, I implored them all
Not to assail me with my father's aid,
Nor blend their better definy with mine..
For melancholy had congeal'd my blood,
: And froze affecion in my chilly breast.

At last my Sire, rous'd with the base attempt
To force me from him, which thou rend'red'ft vain,
To his own daughter bow'd his hoary head,
Besought me to commiserate his age,
And vow'd he Ihould not, could not die in peace,.
Unless he saw me wedded, and fecur'd
From violence-and outrage. Then, my Lord!
In my extreme difitefs I elcd on thee,
Thee I befpake, priof'" rong desire , :
To lead a fmgle, folai4 ., '
And-begg'd thy N -In" 'to demand -

!er for a wife whose heart' as" dead to love.

;' How thou perfifted'ft after this, thou know'ft, .:: i.

And must confess that I am not unjust, -

,
Nor more to thee than to myself injurious. -

L. Rand. That I confess; yet ever must regret,-:

The grief I cannot cure. Would thou wert inot
Compos'd of grief and tenderness alone,
But had'st a spark of other paflions in thee,
Pride, anger, vanity, the fh-ong desire :-
Of admiration, dear to woman kind; - -
These might contend mith,' and allay tlihygf,
As meeting tides and chrlneints .smooth ou'iirth. -

La. Rand. To such a cause the human mind-oft owes.

Its transient calm, a calm, I envy not. - -

L.Rand. Sure thou artnot the.daughter of Sir.;Ialcol:.,-
Strong was his rage, eternal his-refenimeit: et .
For when thy brother fell, 'he fmii'd to hearS. .
That Douglas' Son in the fame field was slain. '

L. Rand. Straight to the camp,

Where every warriour on the tip-toe Plands
Of expectation, and impatient asks
Each who arrives, if he is come to tell
The Danes are lauded.

La. Rand. 0, may adverse winds,

Far fiom the coast of Scotland, drive their fleet!
And every foldierof both hosts return
In peace and safety to 1,is pleasant home!

L. Ranzd. Thou fpeak'ft a woman's, hear a warriour's

wifll:

Eight from their native land, the. formy north,
AMay the wind blow, till every keel is six'd
Iminoveab!e in Caledonia's flanid !
Then flall our foes repent their bold invasion,
And roving armies shun the fatal fiore.

La. Rand. War I detelt: but war with foreign foes,

W'. ofe. manners, ianguagc, and v:: ofe looks arc i.range,
Is not so horrid, por to me so hatcful,
As that which with onr neighbours oft we wage.
A river here, there an ideal line,
By f.Incy drawn, divides the lii.er kingdoms.
On each ride dwells a people similar,
As twins are to each other; valiant both;
Both for their valour famons thro' the w orld.
Yet will they not unite their kindred arms,
And, if they mul have war, wage distant war,
But witl each other fight in cruel conflict.
Gallanc in strife, and noble in their ire,
The battle is their pastime. They go forth
Gay in the morning, as to summer Iport;
When ev'ning comes, the glory of the morn,
The youthful warriour is a clod of clay.
Thus fall the prime of eirher hapless land;
And lich the fruit of Scotch and English wars.

L. Rand. I'll hear no more: this melody would make

A foldier.drop his sword, and doff his arms,
Sit dowvn and wveep the conquests he has made;
Yea, (like a monk,) ting reft and peace in hcav'n ..

To fouls of warriours in his battle slain.
Lady, Farewel: I leave thee not alone;
Yonder comes one whose love makes duty light..

Enter ANNA.

Anna. Forgive the rathnefs of your Anna's love:

Urg'd by affection, I have thus prefum'd
To interrupt your solitary thoughts;
And warn you of the hours that you negle&,
And lose in sadness.

La. Rand. So to lose my hours
Is all the use I wish to make of time.

Anna. To blame thee, Lady, suits not with my slate:

But sure I am, filce death first prey'd on man,
Never did fLiter thus a brother mourn.
What had your sorrows been if you had loft,
In early youth, the huiband of your heart?

La. Rand. Oh!

Anna. Have I difltefs'd you with officious love,

And ill-tim'd mention of your brother's fate?
Forgive me, Lady: humble tho' I am,
The mind I bear partakes not of my fortune:
So fervently I love you, that to dry ;
These piteous tears, I'd throw my life away.-'

La. Rand. What power directed thy unconscious

tongue
To speak as thou haft done? to name-

Anna. I know not:

But since my words have made my mifti'efS tremble,
I will speak so no more; but silent mix
My tears with her's.

La. Rand. No, thou shalt not be silent.

I'll trust thy faithful love, and thou shalt be . '
Henceforth th' inftru&ed partner of my woes.
But what avails it?'Can thy feeble pity
Roll back the flood of never-ebbing time?-::
Compel th'eearth and ocean to give up -
Their dead alive?

La. Rand. Didft thou not alk what had my sorrows

If I in early youth had loft a husband ?-
In the cold bosom of the earth is lodg'd,
Mangl'd with wounds, the huiband of my youth;
And in some cavern of the ocean lies
My child and his. -

Anna. O ! Lady, most rever'd .

The tale wrapt up in your amazing words
Deign to unfold.

La. Rand. Alas! an antient feud,

Hereditary evil, was the source
Of my misfortunes. Ruling fate decreed,
That my brave brother fould in battle save
The life of Douglas' son, our house's foe:
The youthful warriours vow'd eternal friendflip.
To fee the vaunted siser of his fiiend
Impatient, Douglas to Balarmo came,
Under a borrow'd name. - My heart he gain'd;
Nor did I long refuse the hand he begg'd:
My brother's presence authoris'd our marriage.
Three weeks, three little weeks, with wings of down,
Had o'er us flown, when my lov'd Lord was call'd
To fight his father's battles; and with him,
In spite of all my tears, did Malcolm go.
Scarce were they gone, when my itern Sire was told
That the false stranger was Lord Douglas' son.
Frantic with rage, the Baron drew his sword,
And queltioh'd me. Alone, forsaken, faint,
Kneeling beneath his sword, fault'ring I took
An oath equivocal, that I ne'er would
Wed one of Douglas' name. Sincerity,
Thou first of virtues, let no mortal leave
Thy onward path! altho' the earth ofluld gape,
And from the gulph of hell deftruftion cry
To take dilfimulation's winding way.

Anna. Alas ! how few of woman's fearful kind
Durst own a truth so hardy! . n

La. Rapins

:* ''
.. .G.,

r~~~i ~ La. Rand. The firit truth'

Is easiest to avow. This moial learn,
This precious moral, from my tragic tale.--
In a few days the dreadful tidings came
That Douglas and my brother both were slain.
My Lord! my life ! my huiband!- mighty God!
What had I done to merit such affliction?

Anna. My dearest Lady! many a.tale of tears

I've listen'd to; but never did I hear
A tale so fad as this.

La. Rand. In the firft'days

Of my distracting grief, I found myself--
As women wish to be who love their Lords.
But who durst tell my father? The good priest.
Who join'd our hands, my brother's antient tutor, -
With his lov'd Malcolm, in the battle fell:
They two alone were privy to the marriage.
On silence and concealment I refolv'd,
Till time fiould make my father's fortune mine.
That very night on which my son was born,
My nurse, the only confident I had,
Set out with him to reach her fiiter's house:
But nurse, nor infant, have I ever seen
Or heard of, Anna, since that fatal hour.
My murder'd child!- had thy fond' piother sear'd
The loss of thee, file had loud fame d:sy'd,
Defpis'd her father's rage, her father's grief,
And wander'd with thee thro' the scorning" w0odd.

Anna. Not seen nor heard of! then perhaps leimaes.
La. Rand. Fain wou'd I lean upon that ilendeer A .

But it was dark December: wind and rain *
Had beat all night. Across the Carron lay
The deffin'd road; and in its swelling flood
My faithful servant perifll'd with my child.
O hapless son! of a most hapless fire !.
But they are both at reft; and I alone' 't,
Dwell in this world of woe, condemn'd to walk- . i

.

Like a guilt-troubled ghost, my painful round;.
.Nor ha despiteful fate permitted me

^B - Tlie,

The comfort of a solitary sorrow.
Tho' dead to love, I was compell'd to wed
Randolph, who fnatch'd me from a villain's arms;
And Randolph now possesses the domains
That by Sir .MIalcoln's death on me devolv'd;
Domains, that hould to Douglas' ibn have giv'ri
A Baron's title, and a Baron's pow'r.
Such were my soothing thoughts, while I bewail'd
The flaughter'd father of a son unborn.
And -when that son came, like a ray fiom heav'n,
Which mhines and disappears; alas! my child !
How long did thy fond mother grasp the hope
Of having thee, Ihe knew not how, reflor'd ?
Year after year hath worn her hope away;
But left still undiminilh'd her desire.

Anna. The hand, that spins th'uneven thread of life,
May smooth the length that's yet to come of your's.

La. Rand. Not in this world, I've confider'd well

Its various evils, and on whom they fall.
Alas! how oft does goodness wound itself,
And sweet affection prove the spring of woe !
O ! had I dy'd when my lov'd husband fell!
Had some good angel op'd to me the book
Of providence, and let me read my life,
My heart had broke when I beheld the fum
Of ills, which one by one I have endur'd.

Anna. That God, whose ministers good angels are,

Hath ihut the book in mercy to mankind.
But we must leave this theme: Glenalvon comes:
I saw him bend on you his thoughtful eyes,
And hitherwards he slowly stalks his way.

La. Rand. I will avoid him, an ungracious person
Is doubly irksome in an hour like this.

Anna. Why speaks my lady thus of Randolph's heir ?
La. Rand. Because he's not the heir of Randolph's

virtues.

Subtle anShrewd, he offers to mankind
An artificif image of himself:
And he with ease can vary to the tafle

. - :{'
-.

Of different men, it's features. Self-deny'd- .
And master of his appetites he seems:
But his fierce nature, like a fox chain'd up,
Watches to seize unseen the wifh'd-for prey.
Never were vice and virtue pois'd so ill
.As it Glenalvon's unrelenting mind.
Yet is he brave and politic in war,
And stands aloft in these unruly times.
Why I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter:
Stay and detain him till I reach the cafile.

[Exit La. Randolph.

Anna. 0 happiness ! where art thou to be found ?

I fee thou dwellelt not with birth and beauty,
Tho' grac'd with grandeur, and in wealth array'd:
Nor doff thou, it would seem, with virtue dwell;
Else had this gentle Lady mifs'd thee not.

Enter GLENALVON..

Glen. What dolt thou muse on, meditating maid ?

Like some entranc'd and visionary seer
On earth thou ftand'ft, thy thoughts ascend to heaven.

Anna. Wou'd that I were, e'en as thou fay'ft, a leer,
To have my doubts by heav'nly vision clear'd!

Glen. What dost thou doubt of ? what haft thou to do

With fubjeds intricate ? Thy youth, thy beauty,
Cannot be queftion'd: think of these good gifts;
And then thy contemplations will be pleasing.

Anna. Let women view yon monument of woe,

Then boast of beauty : who so fair as she ?
But I muff follow: this revolving day
Awakes the mem'ry of her antient woes.

[Exit Anna.

GLENALVON solus.

So !- Lady Randolph hnuns me ; by and by
I'll woo her as the lion wooes his brides.
The deed's a-doing now, that makes me lord
Of these rich valleys, and a chief of pow'r.
The season is most apt; my founding steps
Will not be heard amidf the din of arms.

A band of fierce Barbarians, from the hills,
Ruun'd liEke a torrent down upon the vale,
Sweeping our flocks and herds. The mhepherds fled
For safety, and for succour, I alone,
With bended bow, and quiver full of arrows,
Hover'd about tie enemy, and mark'd
The road he took, then halted to my friends;
Whom, with a troop of fifty chosen me' .

That our good King had fummon'd his bold Peers.
To lead their warriours to the Carron fide,
I left my father's house, and took with me .
*A chosen servant to conduc my steps;-.-
Yon trembling coward who forfopk his mafler...

We are thy debtors fill; thy high desert
O'ertops our gratitude. I must proceed,
As was at firit intended, to the camp.
Some of my train I fee are speeding hither,
Impatient doubtless of their Lord's delay.
Go with me; Norval, and thine eyes shall fee
The chosen warriours of thy native land,
Who languish for the fight, and beat the air
With brandifh'd swords.

Nor. Let us begone, my Lord..

About the time that the declining fun
Shall his broad orbit o'er yon hills suspend,
Expe&R us to return. This night once more
Within these walls I reft; my tent I pitch
To-morrow in the field. Prepare the seas.
Free is his heart who for his country fights:
He in the eve of battle may resign
Hinfelf to social pleasure; sweetest then,
When danger to a soldier's foul indears
The human joy that never may return.

Child that I was, to start at my own ihadow,
And be the shallow fool of coward conscience !
I am not what I have been; what I fhould.be.
The.darts of deffiny have almost pierc'd
My marble heart. Had I one grain of faith
In holy legends, and religious tales,
I mhould conclude there was an arm above
That fought against me, and malignant turn'd,
To catch myself, the subtle snare I set.
Why, rape and murder are not simple means!
Tl' hnperfect rape to Randolph gave a spouse;
And the intended murder introduc'd
A favourite to hide the fun from me;
And worst of all, a rival. Burning hell!
This were thy centre, if I thought she lov'd him!
'Tis certain me contenns me; nay commands me,
And waves the flag of her displeasure o'er m,
In his behalf. And shall I thus be brav'd?
Curb'd as {he calls it, by dame chafity ?
Infernal fiends, if any fiends there are
More fierce than hate, ambition and revenge,
Rife up and fill my boffom with your fires,
And policies remorseless! Chance may spoil
A finle aim ; but perseverance must
Prosper at last. For chance and fate are words:
Perfiffive wiidom is the fate of man.
Darkly a projet 'ppears upon my mind,
Like the red moon when rising in the east,
Crofs'd and divided by strange colour'd clouds.
I'll seek the slave who came with Norval hither,
And for his cowardice was spurn'd from him.
I've known a followers rankled boffom breed
Venom most fatal to his heedless Lord.

Good tidings-of vour'kindihian's long loft child.

Who saw no end of black adversity:
Yet for the wealth of kingdoms, I would not
Have tauch'd that infant, with a hand of harm.

To the last hour that thou didft keep the child.

sris. Fear not my faith, tho' fmuit ieak'myliame,

Within the cradle,. where the infant lay,
Was ftow'd a mighty flore of gold and jewels :'
Tempted by which we did resolve to'hide,
From all-the world, this wbnderful event,
And like a peasant breed the noble child.
That none might mark the change of our efiate,
We left the countrr, travell'd to the North,
Bought flocks and herds, and gradually brought forth
Our secret wealth. But God's all-feeing eye
Beheld our avarice, and smote us iore.
For one by -one all our own children dy'd,
And. he, the Stranger, sole remain'd the heir
Of what indeed was his. Fain then would I,.
Who wtith a fathers fondness lov'd the boy,
Have trusted him, nomw in the dawn of ycuthi
With his own secret: but my anxious wife,
Foreboding evil, never would consent.
Mean while the fripling grew in yeari and beauty ;
And, as we oft obferv'd, he bore himself
Not as the offspring of our cottage bloo ; .
For nature will break out: mild witli the Uild,
But with the fioward he was fierce as'fire,
And night and day he talk'd of war and arms.

The fastest fiiend, the best, the kindest matler:
But ah ! he knew not of my fad estate.
After that battle, where his gallant son,
Your own brave brother, fell, the good old Lord
Grew desperate and reckless of the world;
And never, as he erst was wont, went forth
To overlook the conduct of his servants.
By them I was thurft out, and them I blame:
Miay heav'n so judge me as I judg'd my malter!
And God so love me as I love his race !

La. Rand. His race shall yet reward thee. On thy

faith

Depends the fate of thy lov'd master's house.
Rememb'reft thou a little lonely hut,
That like a holy hermitage appears
.iAmong the cliffs of Carron ?

Prif. I remember |

The cottage of the cliffs.

La. Rand. 'Tis that I mean:

There dwells a man of venerable age,
Who in my father's service spent his youth
Tell him I sent thee, and with him remain,
Till I ihall call upon thee to declare,
Before the King and nobles, what thou now
To me haft told. No more but this, and thou
Shalt live in honour all thy future days;
Thy son so long Ihall call thee father frill,
And all the land mhall bless the man, who fav'd
The son of Douglas, and Sir Malcolm's heir.
Remember well my words: if thou ihould'ft meet
Him whom thou call'dit thy son, ftll call him so;
And mention nothing of his noble father.

And fiake him wear tliefe jewels in his arms;

Gle,;. Noble Dame!

The hov'ring Dane at last his men hath landed:
No band of pirates: but a mighty holt,
That come to fettle where their valour conquers;
To win a country or to lose themselves.

La. Rand. But whence comes this intelligence, GC6In

alvon ?

Glen. A nimble courier sent from yonder camp,

To haften up the chieftains of the north,
Inform'd me, as he pall, that the fierce Dane
Had on the eaflern coalt of Lothian landed,
Near to that place where the fea-rock immense,
Amazing Bais, looks o'er a fertile land.

La. Rand. Thenmuitthisweflern army marchtojoin.
The warlike troops that guard Edina's toyw'rs.

Glen. Beyond all quelfion. If imparing time

HTas not efrac'd the image of a place,
Once perfect in my breast, there is a wild
Which lies to westward of that mighty rock;
And eems by nature formed for the camp
Of water-wafted armies, whose chief flrength
Lies in firm foot, unflank'd with warlike horse;
If martial skill directs the Daniih lords,
There inacceflible their army lies
To our swift fcow'ring hore : the bloody field-
iMuft man to man, and foot to foot ;be fought.

La. Rand. How manymotherslhitsewailthei- sons:
Tow.i manv widows weep their huifands slain - .

Ye dames of Denmark! ev'n for you I feel,
Who sadly fitting on the fea-beat flore,
Long look for lords that never flall return.

Glen. Oft has th' unconquer'd Caledonian sword

Widow'd the north. The children of the slain
Come, as I hope, to meet their father's fate,
The monster war, with his infernal brood,
Loud yelling fury, and life-ending pain,
Are objes suited to Glenalvon's foul.
Scorn is more grievous than the pains of death:
Reproach more piercing than the pointed sword.

La. Rand. I. scorn thee not, but when I ought to

scorn;

Nor e'er reproach, but when insulted virtue
Against audacious vice asserts herself.
I own thy worth, Glenalvon; none more apt
Than I to praise thine eminence in arms,
And be the eccho of thr martial fame.
No longer vainly feed a guilty passion;
Go and pursue a lawful miitrefs, Glory.
tJpon the Danish cres.s redeem thy fault:
- And let thy valour be the mhield of Randolph.
:- Glen. One instant flay, and hear an alter'd man.

When beauty pleads for virtue, vice abaih'd
Flies its own colours, and goes o'er to virtue.
I am your convert; time will Ihew how truly;
Yet one immediate proof I mean to give.
That youth, for whom your ardent zeal to-day,
Somewhat too haughtily, defyd your slave,
Amidst the mhock of armies I'll defend,
And turn death from him, with a guardian arm.
Sedate by use, my bosom maddens not
At the tumult'ous uproar of the field.

La. Rand. At thus, Glenalvon, and I am thy friend:

To fay and swear whatever I suggest, .
Norval, I'm told, has that alluring look,
'Twixt man and woman, which I have obferv'd,
To charm the nicer and fantaflic dames,
Who are, like Lady Randolpb, full of virtue.
In railing Randalph's jealousy I may
But point him to the truth. He seldom errs
Who thinks the worfi he can of womankind.

ACT IV.
SCEN E, A Court, &c. as before.

Flolrifh of Trumlpets.
Enter Lord RANDOLPH attended.

Lord RANDOLPH.

SUmmon an hundred horse by break of day;
J To wait our pleasure at the cafile gate,

Enter Lady RANDOLPH.
La. Rad. Alas! my Lord ! I've heard unwelcome

news;
The Danes are landed.

L. Rand. Ay ! no inroad this

Of the Northumbrian bent to take a spoil:
No sportive war, no tournament essay,
Of tome young knight refolv'd to break a spear,
And fIain with hoRtile blood his maiden arms.
The Danes are landed: we muff beat them back,
Or live the slaves of Denmark.

La. Rand. Dreadful times !

L. Rand. The fenceless villages are all forsaken;

The tremnbling mothers: and their children lodg'd
In wall-girt tow'rs and castles; whilit the men
Retire indignant. Yet, like broken waves,
They but retire more awful to return.

La. Rand. Immense, as fame reports, the Daniih

host-

L. Rand. Were it as famous as loud fame repor·t

An army knit like ours would pierce it thro'
Brothers, that 1hrink not from each other's fide,
And fond companions, fill our warlike files:

" . .
* o

For his dear offspring,and the wife he loves,
The husband, and the fearless father arm.
In vulgar breasts heroic ardor burns,
And the poor peasant mates his daring Lord.

La. Rand. Men's minds are temper'd, like their

fvords, for war;

Lovers of danger, on defiruction's brink
They joy to rear ereft their daring forms.
Hence, 'early graves; hence, the lone widow's life,
And the fad mother's grief-embitter'd age.
Where is our gallant guest ?

L. Rand. Down in the vale

I left him, managing a fiery steed;
Whose itubbornnefs had foil'd the strength and kill
Of every rider. But behold he comes,
In earnest conversation with Glenalvon.

Enter NTORVAL and GLFNALVON.

Glenalvon ! with the lark arise; go forth,

And lead my troops that lie in yonder vale:
Private I travel to the royal camp:
Norval, thou go'ft with me. But fay, young man I
Where didft thou learn so to discourse of war,
And in such terms as I o'erheard to-day ?
War is no village science, nor its phrase
A language taught amongfl the 'hepherd fwaifs.

Nor. Small is the Ikill my Lord delights to praise-

In him he favours--Iear from whence it came.
Beneath a mountain's brow, the most remote
And inacceflible by shepherds trode,
In a deep cave, dug by no mortal hand,
A hermit liv'd; a melancholy man,
Who was the wonder of our wand'ring swains.
Austere and lonely, cruel to himself,
Did they report him; the cold earth his bed, -
Water his drink, his food the Ihepherd's alms.
I went to fee him, and my heartvwas touched
With rev'rence and with pity. Mild he spake,
And, entering on discourse, such sories told
se..- D - AsI

As made me oft revisit his fad cell.
For he had been a soldier in his youth;
And fought in famous battles, when the Peers
Of Europe, by the bold Godfredo led,
Against th'ufurping Infidel difplay'd
The cross of Chrifi, and won the Holy Land.
Pleas'd with my admiration, and the fire
His speech struck from me, the old man would fllake
His years away, and a&i his young encounters:
Then, hiving (hew'd his wounds, he'd fit him down,
And ail the live-long day discourse of war.
To help my fancy, in the smooth green turf
He cut the figures of the marlhall'd hoils;
Defcrib'd the motions, and explain'd the use
Of the deep columnn, and the lengthen'd line,
The square, the crescent, and the phalanx firm.
.. For all that Saracen or Chriflian knew
Of war's vast art was to this hermit known.

L. Rand. Why did this soldier in a desert hide
Those qualities that fiould have grac'd a camp ?

Nor. That too at last I learn'd. Unhappy man!

Returning homewards by Messina's port,
Loaded with wealth and honours bravely won,
A rude and boift'rous captain of the sea
Salen'd a quarrel on him. Fierce they fought:
The firanger fell, and with his dying breath
Declar'd his name and lineage ! Mighty God !
The soldier cried, my brother ! Oh ! my brother!

La. Rand. His brother !

Nor. Yes; of the fame parents born;

His only brother. They exchang'd forgiveness:
And happy, in my mind, was he that dy'd:
For many deaths has the survivor fuffer'd.
In the wild desert on a rock he fits,
Or on some nameless scream's untroden banks,
And ruminates all day his dreadful fate.
At times, .alas! not in his perfet mind !
Holds dialgRues with his lov'd brother's ghost;
And det eai night-forfakes his fullen couch,

"'

'
* '^ .

To make fad orisons for him he flew.

La. Rand. To what mysterious woes are riortals

born!

In this dire tragedy were there no more
Unhappy persons? did the parents live ?

NVor. No; they were dead: kind heav'n had los'd

their eyes
Before their son had shed his brother's blood.

L. Rand. Hard is his fate; for he was not to blame I

There is a destiny in this fhrange Wxorld,
Which oft decrees an undeserved doom:
Letichoolmen tellnswhy.-From whence these founds?

[Truimpets at a dijiance.]

Enter an OFFICER.

Of. My Lord, the trumpets of the troops of Lorn;
The valiant leader hails the noble Randslph .

L. Rand. Mine antient guest ! does he the warriouirs

lead ?
Has Denmark rous'd the brave old Knight to arms?-

Of. No; worn with warfare, he religns the sword..

His eldest hope, the valiant John of Lorn,
Now leads his kindred bands.

L. Rand. Clenalvon, go,

With hospitality's moit ifrong request
Intreat the chief.

[Exit Glenalvon;

Of. My Lord, requeffs are vain.

He urges on, impatient of delay,
Stung with the tidings of the foe's approach.

L. Rand. May victory fit on the warriour's plume

Bravest of men ! his flocks and herds are iaie;
Remote from war's alarms his paflures lie,
By mountains inaccellible fecur'd:
5 et foremolt he into the plain descends,
Eager to bleed in battles not his own.
Such were the heroes of the antient world':
Contemners they of indolence and gain; ,
Vikt still for love of glory, and of arms, ;
L*:; .. *D 2 Pron<A

Prone to encounter peril, and to lift
Against each strong antagonist the spear.
I'll go and press the heroe to my breast.

Nor. Ha! fl-ould they not?

Blefs'd be the hour I left my father's honfe!
I might have been a ihepherd all my days,
And tole obscurely to a peasant's grave.
Now, if I live, wiitil mirhty chiefs I iland,
And, if I fall, woith noble dull i lie.

La. Rand, There is a gen'rous spirit in thy breast,

That could have well flilain'd a prouder fortune,
This way with me ; under yon spreading beech,
Ulifeen, unheard, by human eye or ear,
I will amaze thee with a wond'rous tale.

Nor. L-et there be danger, Lady, with the secret,

That I may hug it to my grateful heart,
And prove my faith. Command my sword, my life:
These are the role poffeflions of poor Norval.

La. Rand. IKnow'ft thou these gems?

Nor. Durst I believe mine eyes
I'd fay I knew them, and they were my father's.

La. Rand. Thy father's, fay'It thou! ah! they

were thy father's!

Nor. I saw them once, and curiously inquir'd

Of both my parents, whence such splendor came ?
But I was check'd, and more could never learn.

La. Rand. Then learn of me, thou art not Nornal's

Nor. Not Norval's son !

For'noble was thy Sire! !

Nor. I will believe thee----
0 ! tell me farther ! Say who was my father ?

La. Rand. Douglas!
Nor-. Lord Douglas, whom to-day I saw ?
La. Rand. His younger brother.

Nor. And in yonder camp ?

La. Rand. Alas!
Nor. You make me tremble-Sighs and tears !
Lives my brave father ?

La. Rand. Ah ! too brave indeed !

He fell in battle ere thyself waft born.

-Nor. Ah me unhappy ! 'ere myself was born!
But does my mother live ? I may conclude,
From my own fate, her portion has been sorrow.

La. Rand. She lives; but wattes her life in constant

woe,
Weeping her husband slain, her infant loft.

Nor. You that are fkill'd so well in the fad story

Of my unhappy parents, and with tears
Bewail their destiny, now have compalfion
Upon the offspring of the friends you lov'd!
O ! tell me who, and where my mother is !
Opprefs'd by a base world, perhaps {he bends
Beneath the weight of other ills and grief;
And desolate, implores of heav'n the aid
Her fTn lhould give. It is, it must be so-
Your countenance confesses that Ihe's wretched.

The poor remains of beauty once admir'd:
The autumn of my days is come already;
For sorrow made my summer haste away,
Yet in my prime I equall'd not thy father;
His eyes were like the eagle's, yet Sometimes
Liker the dove's; and, as he pleas'd, he won
All hearts with softness, or with spirit aw'd.

Nor. How did he fall ? Sure 'twas a bloody field
When Douglas dy'd. O I have much to alk!

La. Rand. Heareafter thou Ihalt hear the lengthen'd

tale

Of all thy father's and thy mother's woes.
At present this: thou art the rightful heir
Of yonder catle, and the wide domains
Which now Lord Randolph, as my hulband, holds.
But thou shalt not be wrong'd; I have tho pow'r
To right thee ffill: before the King I'll kneel,
And call Lord Douglas to protet his blood.

ANor. The blood of Douglas will protec itself.
La. Rand. But we lhall need both friends and fa-

vour, boy,

To.wref thy lands and lordmhip from the gripe
Of Randolph and his kinsman. Yet I think
My tale will move each gentle heart to pity,

And; when you enter, speak of war no more.

her eye,
And her impatience to be gone, confirm it.

Glen. He parted from her now: behind the mount,
Amonget the trees, I saw him glide along.

L. Raid. For fad, fequefter'd virtue she's renown'd!
Glen. Mos true, my Lord.

L. Rand. Yet this diffinguifh'd Dame

Invites a youth, th' acquaintance of a day,
Alone to meet her at the midnight hour.
This aifignation, [fhewvs a letter,],the assassin freed.
Her manifest affetion for the youth,
Might breed suspicion in a husband's brain,
Whose gentle consort all for love had wedded;
Much more in mine. Matilda never lov'd me.
Let no man after me a woman wed,
Whose heart he lnows he has not; tho' she brings
A mine of gold, a kingdom for her dowry;
For let her seem, like the nights shadowy queen,
Cold and contemplative ;-He cannot trust her:
She may, the will, bring shame and forrowon him;
The worf of sorrows, and the worst of hames !

Glen. Yieldnot, myLord, tofuchafflifingthoughts;

But let the spirit of an husband sleep,
Till your oewn senses make a sure conclusion.

Glen. Permit me now to make 'one flight essay.

Of all the trophies which vain mortals boat,
By wit, by valour, or by wisdom is on,
T he first and fairest, in a young man's eye,
Is woman's captive heart. Successful love.
With glorious fumes intoxicates the mind:
And the proud conqueror in triumph.moves
Air-born, exalted above vulgar men.

L. Rand. And what avails this maxim ?

Glen. Much, my Lord !

Withdraw a little: I'll accost young Norval,
And with ironical derisive counsel
Explore his spirit. If he is no more
-Than humble Norval, by thy favour rais'd,
Brave as he is, he'll Ihrink aflonilh'd fiom me:
But if he be the fav'rite of the fair,
Lov'd by the firfi of Caledonia's dames,
He'll turn upon me, as the lion turns
Upon the hunter's spear. -

And tho' I have been told, that there are men
Who borrow fiiendihip's tongue to speak their scorn,
Yet in such language I am little fkill'd.
Therefore I thank Glenalvon for his counsel,
Altho' it founded harshly. Why remind
Me of my birth obscure ? Why slur my pow'r

And ever honour'd with thy Douglas live.

Nor. And doql thou call me father? 0 my-fon!

I think that I could die to make amends
For the great wrong I did thee. 'Twas my crime
Which in the wilderness so long conceal'd
The blossom of thy youth.

Doug. Not worse the fruit,

That in the wilderness the blossom blow'd.
Amongst the ihepherds, in the humble cote,
I learn'd some lessons, which I'll not forget
When I inhabit yonder lofty towers.

The poor man's friend; and, when my vassals bow,

Doug. How know'it thou that?

Nor. I will inform you how.

When ev'ning came, I left the secret place
Appointed for me by your mother's care,
And fondly trode in each accuftom'd path
That to the cafle leads. Whilst thus I rang'd,
I was alarm'd with unexpected founds
Of earnest voices. On the persons came;
Unseen I lurked, and o'erheard them name
Each other as they talk'd, Lord Randolph this,
And that Glenalvon: ffill of you they spoke,
And of the Lady: threat'ning was their fpeecb,
Tho' but imperfectly my ear could hear it.
'Twas firange, theyfaid, a wonderful difcov'ry;
And ever and anon they vow'd revenge.

Doug. Revenge ! for what ?-

Nor. For being what you are;

, -Sirl

Sir Malcolm's heir: how else have you offended -
When they were gone, I hy'd me to my cottage,
And there fat musing how I best mightfind
Means to infbrm you of their wicked purpose.
But I could think of none: at last perplex'd
I issued forth, encompafing the tow'r
With many a weary ftep and wishful look.
Now providence hath brought you to my fight,
Let not your too courageous spirit scorn
The caution which I give.

Doug. I scorn it not.

My mother warn'd nie of Glenalvon's b'aenefs:
But I will not fufpe& the noble Randolph.
In our encounter with the vile afaffins,
I mark'd his brave demeanor: him I'll trust.

Nor. I fear you will too far.

Doug. Here in this place

I wait my mother's coming: file shall know
What thou haft told: her counsel I will follow;
'And cautious ever are a mother's counsels.
You must depart: your presence may prevent
Our interview.

Like Douglas conquer, or like Douglas die.

Enter Lady RANDOLPH.
La. Rand. My son! I heard a voice

Doug --T he voice was mine.

La. Rand. i.dt thou complain aloud to nature's ear,
That thus in dulky ihades, at mid-night hours,
By flealth the mother and the son lhould meet ?

[Emhracit himn.

Dou~. No; on this happy day, this better hirth.day,
AMy thoughts and words are all of hope and joy.

La. Ra;.d. Sad fear and melancholy fill divide

Tihe empire of ny breaf with hope and joy.
Now hear what I advise.

Douig. First, let me tell
What may the tenor of vour counsel change.

La. Rand My heart forebodes some evil !

Doug. 'Tis not good-

At eve, unseen by Randolph and Glenalvon,
The good old nTorval in the grove o'erheard
Their conversation: oft they mention'd me
'r:Vith dreadful threat'nings; you they sometimes nam'd.
'l'w as strange, they said, a wonderful difcov'ry;
And ever and anon they vow'd revenge.

La. Rand. Defend us gracious God! we are be-

tray'd:

They have found out the secret of thy birth;
It muf be so. That is the great difcov'ry.
Sir ,ialcolm's heir is come to claim his own;
And he will be reveng'd. Perhaps ev'n now,
Arm'd and prepar'd for murder, they but wait
A darker and more silent hour, to break
Into the chamber where they think thou fleep'ft.
This moment, this, heav'n hath ordain'd to save thee .
Fly to the camp, my son!

Doug. And leave you he11e !

'
tNo: to tb cast let us go together, " , j

Calf up the antient servants of your house,
Who in their youth did eat your father's bread.
Then tell them loudly that I am your son.
If in the breafis of men one spark remains.
Of sacred love, fidelity, or pity,
Some in your cause will arm. I ask but few
To drive those spoilers from my father's house.

La. Rand. 0 Nature, Nature! what can check

thy force ?

Thou genuine offspring of the daring Douglas!
But rush not on delh'uetion: save thyself,
And I am safe. To me they mean no harm.
Thy flay but rifls thy precious life in vain.
That winding path conducts thee to the river.
Cross where thou feeft a broad and beaten way,.
Which running eastward leads thee to the camp.
Instant demand admittance to Lord Douglas.
Shew him these jewels, which his brother wore.
Thy look, thy voice, will make him feel the truth,.
Which I by certain proof will loon confirm.

Doug. I yield me and obey: but yet my heart

Bleeds at this parting. Something bids me ifay
And guard a mother's life. Oft have I read , .
Of wond'rous deeds by one bold arm atchiev'd- :
Our foes are two: no more: let me go forth, -
And fee if any shield can guard Glenalvon. '

La. Rand. If thou regard'it thy mother, or rever'ft

Thy father's mem'ry, think of this no more.
One thing I have to fay before we part;
Long wert thou loft; and thou art found, my child, :
In a molt fearful season. War and battle
I have great cause to dread. Too well I fee '
Which way the current of thy temper sets: :
To-day I've found thee. Oh ! my long loft hope ^
If thou to giddy valour giv'ft the rein,
To-morrow I may lose my ion for ever.
The love of thee, before thou faw'ft the light,
Suftain'd my life when thy brave father fell.
If thou Ihalt fall, I have nor love nor hope
In this vafte world ! my son, rememnber me3 :. 1. '

Doug. Whatfliall I fay? howcanlgive you comfort?

The God of battles of my life dispose
As may be best for you ! for whose dear fake
I will not bear myself as I refolv'd.
But yet confider, as no vulgar name
That which I boast founds amongst martial men,
How will inglorious caution suit my claim
The post of fate unfirinking I maintain.
My country's foes must witness who I am.
On the invaders heads I'll prove my birth,
'Till friends and foes confess the genuine firain..
If in this strife I fall, blame not your son,
Who if he lives not honour'd, must not live.

La. Rand. I will not utter what my bosom feels.

Too well I love that valour which I warn:
Farewel, my son ! my counsels are but vain.

[Embracing.
And as high heav'n hath will'd it ll must be.

[Separate.
La. Rand. Gaze not on me, thou wilt mistake the

path;
I'll point it out again.

Lord RANDOLPH and GLENALVON.]
