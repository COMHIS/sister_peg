# PREFACE.

:P R E F A C E.

HE success of a Dramatic piece on the Stage,

depends, fays'Voltaile, upon accidental circumftan-
ces, lut tihe day of publication decides its fate.

Perfuadedof the truth of this remark, the Author

of' the Tragedy of Alfred would have submitted his
peirf6riiance,. to the-final judgment of the Reader,
-without preface or apology, if he had not been ad-
'v.ifed,'and indeed urged, to make a reply to some
ho'tile criticisms, which appear to have been
:founded upon prejudice and opinion, rather than
reason, and argument.

It has been alledged, that the character of Al-

fred, in the Tragedy, does not agree with the cha-
rafterof Alfred in History: " That the Hero, the
.Legislator, isdegraded to a Lover, who enters the
Danish :camp, from a private, not a public, mo-
tive, and ats the part of an impostor."

In Tragedy, if the subjea be Historical, an au-
thor is not permitted to introduce events, contrary

Az to

( iv )

to the great eftabliflied faEs of History; for in-
itance, in the Tragedy of Alfred, the Hero must not
be killed, nor driven out of England by the Danes;
but preserving those ancient foundations, as the piers
of his bridge, the Author may bend his arches,
and finifhi the fabrick, according to his taste and
fancy, for the poet is at liberty, and it is the es-
fence of his art, to invent such intermediate circum-
ftarces, and incidents, as he 'thinks will produce
the most affedin.g situations. In this department,_
the Poet's fancy is controuled by nothing, but pro-
bability aud consistence of characer, the barriers of
dramatic truth. Let us apply this principle to the
point in difoute.

Alfred was a young man, when he fought the

battle of Ethendune. The vitory, which gave
him possession of the kingdom, muff have been
gained before he begun to model theftate, Is itim-
probable to suppose, that a young hero was in love
Is it inconsistent to represent the person, who was a
Legislator when advanced in years, as a lover in
his youth ! Does it degrade the character of a hero
to suppose, that he was in love with the princess
whom he afterwards married ? Is it not rather in-
jurious to his heroism to conclude, that he chore a
consort whom he did not love ? If this reasoning is
julf, there will be no difficulty in vindicating the
subsequent conduc of the hero. The dramatic and
the real Alfred, are both involved in the charge of
imposture; both entered the Danish camp in dif-
guise; the previous events, as narrated in the tra-
gedy, are nearly the fame with those mentioned in
history. Alfred, for almost two years, had wan-
dered thro' England, concealing himfelfunder feign-
ed names and characters. He lived in the midst of
his enemies, by being supposed to be dead. Emerg-
ing from this obscurity, he appears in the tragedy,
and is informedof the alarming ambiguous situation
of Ethelfwida ; his usual firatagems present them-
selves, one would think, naturally to his mind, ex-

tremely

(v)

tremely agitated, and prone both by temper and
habit, to the most daring and romantic enterprizes.
He resolves to enter the. Danish camp, to learn the
fate of Ethelfwida, and observe the strength and or-
der of the enemy's army, 'before he ventures a deci-
five engagement. '

The eontinued artifice is .inevitable.' The con-

dut of Alfred, in the camp of Hinguar; the man-
ner in which he 'deceives the Dane, is extremely
fimilarto the .conduct of Orestes in the Eletra of
Sophocles, which no critic hitherto has blamed.
Orestes enters the palace of .Egifthus, as, the mef-
fenger of his own deathi, carrying ur;,' whichi
contains (he fays) the ashes of Orestes, whose hin-
timely fate he most circumstantially relates. The
Grecian hero praatifes the deceit with an intention
to kill the persons whom he deceives. The Englifll
hero deceives Hinguar only to gain access to Ethelf-
wida, without meaning to hurt the person of his
enemy. To praise Sophocles, and blame the author
of Alfred, for the fame conduct, seems a direct
contradiction, which ean only be accounted for, in
one way; an imaginary idea has been formed of the
character of Alfred as an old mortified, ascetic sage,
of spirit too sublime and xtherial to descend to hu-
man passions or human ations. But the real as
well as the dramatic Alfred was a young hero, a -
bard, a winner of battles, brave and magnanimous,
but compelled by the pressure of those desperate
times, in which he lived, to practise a thousand arts
to exist by simulation and dissimulation. Whoever
recollects and weighs these circumstances, will it is
presumed readily pardon the artifice of Alfred, in
the Tragedy, and acknowledge that the feigned in-
cidents of the piece are altogether consistent with the
true. If not, the author must be contented to la-
bour under theimputation of an erroneous judgment,
for he meant nothing less than to degrade the cha-
racter of Alfred; on the contrary, finding in the

A 3 records

( vi )

records of a remote and barbarous age, a hero of
great renown, but from the desert of his historians,
involved in clouds and darkness:

Qui caput inter nubila condit.

he was tempted to seize his name, and display his
character in new situations, conne1Qed with the old
and well known events of his life and fortune.
The play is printed asit was performed. An alter-
ation has been made, in onefcene, and sent to the
Theatre, -which, if the Tragedy. ihould be resumed
or revived, .may .perlh'ps contribute to heighten its
effset. ' ' : '' '

Have scarce preferw'd one heroine fromfalling:

If this green cloth could speak,_ would it not tell,
Upon its wellI-worn nap how oft Ifell ?
To death in various forms deliver'd up,
Steel kills me one night, and the next the Cup:
The tragic process is asjhart, ascertain;

For half is [pent in fludy'ng how to die.

Ailonifll'd as I am, at such a secret;
Who can unfold the cause ? Why, at this hour,
When, big with England's fate, each moment

Does Alfred hide himself, in clouds and dark-

And spread uncertain rumours of his itate,
Confounding all belief?

DEVONSHIRE.

He ipread them not.

From his uncertain fate, those rumours role.
Ere since that time, when the perfidious Dane
Attack'd the Englifi, in the hour of peace,
On Alfred's wedding day.

OFFICER.

It was believed,

That Alfred, in the general carnage, fell,
At Cyppenham ; that, in the swelling flood
Of wintry Avon, Ethelfwida perifh'd.

Such was the first report.

Th' eventful tale of much-enduring Alfred;
And what is yet of Ethelfwida known.

D EVON S HIR E.
When faithless Hinguar, with his host, ad-

The King, diflrafted for his lovely bride,
Sent off a hundred knights, by Surrey led,
To guard the Plir cess to a place of safety :
Then, fu-ious, fac'd the Dane ;-with odds op-

prest,

Around their King, his faithfu! nobles fell,

By cruel hunters chac'd. Much he endur'd;
And much his people fuffer'd. Englilh virtue,
Like England's oak, grew firmer from the storm.
Often the peasant his last morsel brought
To 'the dark wood or cave, where Alfred lay;
If questioned by the Dane, denied the deed;
And died, undaunted, to preserve his prince.

OFFICER.
The itory. thrills my blood; by heaven and

earth-
Where did he reft at last ?

DEVONSHIR E.

He never refted

Even when he had a place of refuge found;
Where the deep winding streams, Parret and

Thone

Their waters mix, a little island lies,
With alders overgrown. No name it had,
Tho' now the name of Athelney it bears.
Marihes and pools, by inundation form'd,
Perplex the dire approach. There Alfred six'd
His dreary habitation. Two brave knights
At first were all his train. Day after day
The numbers grew; and many a gallant knight,
Found out the wild afylui of his Lord.
From thence, with inroads fierce, they gall'd the

Dane.

Dark as the spirits of the night they came,
And vanifh'd at the dawn: In that retreat,
The iun, thro' every sign, o'er Alfred roll'd.

OFFICER.
Did Ethelfwida there rejoin her Lord ?

DEVONSHIR E.

Nor she herself, nor any of her train,
Have ere been heard of, since she left her Lord.

OFFICER.
For certain, then, she lives. If ihe had pe-

Her fate would have been known.

We reach'd a lonely mansion, in a dale,

And in those deserts wild, -Ihe might have dwelt,
Unheard:of and unknown.

Against their fierce attack, our little band,
Around the'Princefs, form'd a fence of steel.
More and more narrow still the circle grew,'
Till I alone was left with Ethelfwida.
Alone I fought, -till at her feet I fell.
Her dismal ihrieks, her piercing cries I heard;
More grievous far, than all the wounds I bore.

Methinks I hear her cries: She calld on Alfred

Why was riot Alfred near ?

From tome who in the troops of HIinguar:fought,

By fad experience ; for the woes of Alfred,
And all the evils of this hapless land,

No ties divine or human, bind the Danes.
Of all the impious race, by far the worst,
And most profane is Hinguar.

I heard the parting words of faithful Surrey,
Which mark too well, the colour of thy purpose.

Thy approbation I do not expet.

None can approve, but those who feel like me.
The Danilh camp, difguis'd, I will explore,
Clad in the vesture of a British- Bard,
And learn, for certain, Ethelfwida's fate,
Whatever has befallen my hapless bride;
Affur'd of that, my heart shall hake no more.

DEVONSHIRE.
Something like this my anxious foul foretold.

ALFRED.

I read thy thoughts, but urge me not to hear

Thy friendly counsels, which I cannot follow.
In great events, the agitated mind
Consults its genius only. Low or high
The active spirits in that level flow,
Nor fall nor rife, to aft another's counsel;
That potent counsellor direAs me now,
I feel the impulse, oft in perils felt:
Nor is my arm confin'd to Ethelfwida;

How we may guard thee best.

ALFRED.

By the moon's light,

As, with a swift career, their camp I pas'd,
A wood, extended on the right I saw,
(Their left the village Ethendune defends,)
Canst thou inform, if they have opened paths, :
Or planted watches there ?

DEVONSHIRE.

Neither, my Lord!
Presumptuous Hinguar holds such caution vain.

Between the fall of night, and the moon's rife,
In silence, thither march a thousand men,

Comes ere the dawn, at dawn they may retire.

ACT II.
S C E N E, The Danish Camp.

Enter S u R R E Y.

SURREY.

T HE tale of Orpheus, (which in Rome I heard,
Whose lyre harmonious civiliz'd mankind,
Is verified to-day. The stubborn sons,
Of Denmark fvmpathize with Alfred's strain;
And, as he leads the song, their paifions flow.
Hinguar himself is wonder-ftruck.

Enter an OFFICER.
O F F I C E R.

Be gone;
Thou tread'ft already on forbidden ground,

SURREY.
Inform the King, that Erick is return'd.

OFFICER.

Hinguar approaches, and with him the bard,

Whose lyre is fram'd, by necromantic art;
Inchanted are the fhings.-Away, with speed.

[Exit Surrey,
Enter HINGUAR, and ALFRED, in conversation,

H IN GU A R. (To the Officer.)
Withdraw. (Exit Off.)

Now, I believe the death of Alfred.

This ring, the well-known signet of his power,
He never truited to another hand.

ALFRED.

ALFRED.

When, in the rocky cave, I found him dead,

I then refolv'd, King of the warlike Danes,
To bear to thee the tidings of his death;
And as a proof, which could not be deny'd,
That ring I took, which erit mine eyes beheld,
Upon his finger plac'd, with rites andcharms,
When he was crown'd, in London, England's King.

H I N G U A R.

I will reward thee to thy utioft wish.

Thou art no Saxon, but of Britiih race,
And lov'ft the mountains of thy native land;
Choose where they fairest rife ; they ihall be thine,
With all their valleys and their Sylvan itreams.
The Gods I serve have sent thee to my aid.
'Tis my belief thou can'st aflift me much,
In what is dearer to my foul than empire.

ALFRED.
How can the bard assist a Prince like thee ?

H IN GU AR.

In high refpeft, I hold thy art divine.

Whate'er thou art, magician, bard or seer,
Or if thou art all these, I crave thine aid.
Amidst my viAories, I am moit wretched
By love tormented, unsuccessful love.

ALFRED.
Thy love, with equal love, is not return'd ?

H I N G U A R.

More grievous till. The fair, my foul desires,

Cannot dittinguilh nor reward my love.
If thou her cruel malady can'st charm,
And drive wild frenzy from her troubled mind,
Talk to fulfil thy wish the power of Hinguar.

ALFRED.

In me behold the man of thy desire.

Unlawful arts I neither use, nor know;
But am, in nature's secrets, deeply flkill'd.
Far from the pleasures and the cares of men,
By flrange misfortun.e, to the defart driven,
A lonely anchoret, for years, I lived.

B To

To me are known the virtues of each plant,
That grows inhill or dale, in fun or shade;
How one, by sympathy, with-madnefs taints;
And how another clears th' infected blood.
Much I can help or harm.

H IN G U A R.

Exert thy kill;

And plant and herb, or song and spell employ.
Do what thou will'ft, so thou reftor'ft the fair.

ALFRED.

Did her dire frenzy from distress arise ?

From sudden perturbation of the mind ?
Or is the cause unknown ?

HINGUAR.

From grief, from fear,

From terror to excess, her frenzy rose.
Dreadful the fihock she suffered !

ALFRED.

How, my Lord?
What did ihe susser ?

H I N G U A R.

In her person, nothing;

But agony of mind, to an excess,
Not easy to delcribe.

ALFRED.

Has she reveal'd
Her name, her familv ?

H IN G U AR.

By different names

She calls herself; and-when with questions urg'd,
She makes extravagant, fantastic answers,
And seems unconscious of her true condition.

ALFRED.

Her general temper, is it fad or gay ?
For frenzy is most various.

HI N G U A R.

So is hers;

For file exhibits every various mood,
That frenzy e'er afium'd. But thou Ihalt fee,
And judge herftrange demeanor. Inyon tent,

With

With purplebright, flhe dwells; and to this.fpot,
Where now we stand, she frequentlyrepairs.
This is her usual hour. Behold! fle comes.

(Enter Ethelfwida, with two 'women attending,

fantastically drefl.)

ALFRED.

How beautiful she is! 0, piteous fight!
Her frenzy's high.

H I N G U A R.

Did ere thine aged eyes
Behold her equal ?

(Ethelfwida passes them, and advances to

the front.)
ETHELSW IDA.

Eagles of the rock,

Lend me your founding wings; cherubs of heaven,
Who soar above the fun, your pinions lend,
To bear me to my love.'

Queen of beauty !

I am thy captive, and obey thy will.
To soothe the grief that preys upo-l thy heart,
My care has hither brought a Bard divine,
Whose voice can charm the ache and agony,
Which spirits feel. He's gentle, mild, and wife,
And ihall attend thv call.

ET ELSWIDA.

I will not call him.
His garb is vile; I hate it.

ALFRED.

Hate not him.

Whose heart is tun'd to sympathize with thine.
I shun the house of mirth, and love to dwell,
A constant inmate of the house of sorrow.

(WThilft he speaks, Ethelfwida gazes and knows

him.)

ETHELSWIDA.

Then thou art not so wife, as wou'd appear,
From thy white head, and grave habiliments.

(Walks afie in great emotion. Returns.)

Why, so am 1. We may consort together,

Who lov'd the maidens fair;
But loose, at large, the rower rang'd,

We must not with one censure level all.
Some men are true of heart, but very few.
Those live not long, they die before their time.
'Tis pity of them. Oh! [walks aside,

With heathens and idolaters, I dwell
Without the benefit of holy church.
Nor shrift, nor absolution have I known,
For seven long years.

ALFRED.

I will, myself, confess thee.

The peace of heaven shall on thy foul descend.
(To the attendants.) A course most fortunate her

In this conceit, to me she may reveal
Her name, her parentage, perhaps the grief
That rankles in her breast. Please to retire,
As if it were confession.

I shall beas I am, or shall be nothing.
Fly from this place of peril; fly, with speed.
Thy pretence to us both is sure perdition..
My own distress, with fortitude, I'bore; -
But feel my-weaknefs, when the danger's thine.
The part I as, I hardly can sustain : -
Didft thou not mark, whep firjt Iheard thy voic'
How real paflion mingled with the feign'd
When Ibeheld thee risen from the grave,
And braving dpath again for Ethelfwida,
The veil of frenzy scarce conceal'd my transport.

To bear thee with me, thro' the host of Den-

This garb secures me frequent, free access.
Now, let me warn thee, fihou'd it be fufpeted,

ALS R E D.

She flew off at once
From that conceit. Her mind's a burning fire,

Where

Where sudden thoughts, like wreaths of faroak

arise,

And, parting from the flame, disperse in air.
Her fhatter'd fancy, like a mirror broken,
Reflets no single image just and true,
But many false ones.

Dost thou hope to cure
The malady, which thou defcrib'fl so well ?

She farted into well-diffembled frenzy.

H INGU A R.
Why ne'er unfold thy doubts ?

E D D A.

Till now, I durst not;

Because I had no proof of my suspicion:
For in thy presence, with amazing art,
She counterfeits diftration. Well I knew
Thy partial love would illreceive a charge
On mere conjeaure founded. What I saw
This day to certainty has chang'd my doubts.
Try her, my Lord; and if I have deceived thee,

Dead or alive. I care not. If helives,

Nor England e'er shake off the yoke of Denmark.
Surrey, tho' warandbatle are my joy,
Yet I desire sometimes in peace to dwell.
Thy sifter's beauty has inflam'd my heart,
And policy accords with love's desire.
The charming Emma ihall be Hinguar's bride:
And England, partial to her own, obey

To the domestic bondage of one wife.

Of love to Alfred, take a faithless hand ?

He is, by heaven !

And my fair captive is the Mercian maid
By Alfred lov'd, the beauteous Ethelfwida !
Go, bring the Saxon hither. [Exit Erick.

Manet H I N G U A R.

Now, I'll found him.

The policy offtate enjoins his death:
The politicks of love suspend his doom.
The instrument he is, by which I'll work
This woman to my will. If I can make
Her lover false to her, pride and revenge,
Will bring her not reluctant to my arms.
Thus play the passions of her wayward sex,
Birds of a kind, they build their nests alike;
And one true falcon, like another flies.
So, every woman, when her love is fcorn'd,
By certain inftinEt, takes the fame revenge.
(Enter ALFRED, in his sirs dress, advances reft-

lutely,]

Twice have we met to-day, and both the times,
With borrow'd names and forms, thou haft de-

ceiv'd me.
Alfred; I know thee now.

ALFRED.

ALFRED.

Hinguar, thou dotl

H I N G U AR.

Repine not at this chance. If we had met,

In lifts of combat or embattled field,
Death or captivity had been thy portion.

ALFRED.
Uncertain ever is the fate of arms.

H I N G U A R.

I have not found it so. In every battle

On my victorious banners fortune waits.
Suppose then, that thou wert, by chance of war,
My pris'ner; fay, what wou'dft thou now expec
Sould be thy doom ?

ALFRED.

-;' ~ ~ 'Tis Hinguar's part to fay,
And mine to susser.

HINGUAR.

Thou shalt susser nothing,

Unworthy of a king. Tho' of the race
Of war and battle, who have ftretch'd the spear
Ofconqueft o'er mankind; yet I will speak
The words of peace. The English and the Danes
Have fought too long, for this contested land,
Whose spacious kingdoms can, with ease, contain
The rival nations; and the fertile fields
Glut, with luxurious plenty, their desires,
Let us divide the Land, and join in league
Eternal: Then, united, shake the world.

ALFRED.

Treaties of peace and leagues have oft been made;
But how observed, thou know'ft.

HINGU AR.

There was no bond

To make the former treaties fast and sure.
The peace I offer now ihall be confirnn'd,
By ties, which bind the nations to each other.
My valiant brother left an only child,
InDenmarkJBorn, but here in England bred;
Matchles' in form and feature is the maid;
Straight as the pine, that grows on Norway's hills.
She rifes tall above the virgin-train:

Blue

Blue rolls her melting eye: Her heaving breast
Is whiter than the snow, that's newly fallen,
This maid of beauty I will give to Alfred,
The pledge and bond of union and of peace.

(AL FRED remains Jilent.

Why dost thou not reply ? Doff thou disdain
A bride of Danish race ?

ALFRED.

Silent, I sand

To learn the full extent of thy design.
Mean'ft thou not still to blend the nations more:
To mix the royal blood of either land;
And wed thyself a wife of Englifi race?

H I N G U A R.
I do.

ALFRED.
And 'tis my bride that thou haft chosen.

H I N G U AR.

Call her not thine. Nothing belongs to thee.
A captive has no right.

ALFRED.

Thou keep'ft thy word,,
And treat'ft me like a king !

H I N G U A R.

I'll make thee one,
Which now thou art not. Wed the maid of Den-

mark;
And o'er thy father's ancient kingdom reign.

ALFRED.

Unworthy I fllould be to reign,-to live,

If I could make fiach barter of my honour,
Is this the peace of Hinguar ?

H I N G U A R.

Yes : no other,

ALFRED.
Are these the terms that thou propound'ft to Alfred?

HINGUAR.
They are.

ALFRED.
I am a cartive a:ld urarm'd;
So, with impunity, thou may'st insult me.

HINGUAR,

HINGUAR.

I Rfand aflonifh'd at thy pride, thy folly.

Thou ruin'd Alfred, think of thy condition.
Thy life or death upon my nod depends.

ALFRED.

Ruin'd I am; but it was human weakness,

And no disgraceful fault, that ruin'd Alfred.
Impell'd by tender, anxious, jealous love;
Despising danger, to thy tents I came ;
And doff thou think I am so quickly alter'd ?
Dost thou imagine, that the dread of death
Can move my foul to yield to thee my bride ?
And lead, if fle would follow me, to ihame?
Hinguar, the meanest man of Saxon race,
In freedom born would from such baseness ihrink;
And scorn, with infamy, to purchase life.

HINGU AR.

Thou talk'ft it well ; and I have often heard

Of the persuasive eloquence of Alfred.
Plain are my words : They speak thy certain doom.
If not the friend and firm ally of Hinguar,
Thou dy'ft.

A L F R ED.

My death will not conclude the war,

One course there is, if greatly thou afpir'ft
To reign supreme in England, and possess
With honour gain'd, fairEthelfwida's charms.

H IN G U AR.
I do.

ALFRED.

Then mark me, Dane ! Tho' thou art sprung

From heroes, more than humana,-Odin's race,
Who ftretch'd the spear of conquest o'er the world;
And thou, thyself, in war and battles bred,
Chain'd to thy sword fubmiflivc fortune lead'ft;
Alfred, whose fathe s have in battle fallen,
Whose valour ne'er could fix inconstant fortune,
Offers to meet thee, in the lifted field;
And, by his single arm, to thineoppos'd,
Decide the sovereignty of England's realm,
By the award of heaven. In this encounter,

Mv-

My nobles and my people will abide;
And, if thou conquer'ft, Ethelfwida's thine.

H I N G U A R.

What folly to presume, thou fallen Alfred !

That I will free my captive, and contend
With him on equal terms!

ALFRED.

Brav'd as I was,

I thought it fitting thus, to meet thy scorn.
'Perhaps 1 entertain'd a glimpse of hope,
That thou might'ft, choose thus nobly to prevail,
To gain by valour warlike England's crown;
And to the beauteous Ethelfwida come,
The vi&or, not the murderer, of her hufland.

H I N G U A R.

The beauteous Ethelfwida has consented

To give her hand. The terms which thou difdain'ft,
Vain glorious Saxon ! are more ample far,
Than those which fihe did stipulate for thee.
Thus {he rewards the conitancy of Alfred.
Confider that.

ALFRE D.
No, not one moment, Dane.
Thy faith in love and war to me are known.

H I N G U A R.

I will take no advantage of thy passion.

Hearmy determin'd purpose: Thou shalt die,
Or wed the maid of Denmark. Heated now
And chaff'd with keen contention, pride rebels
Against thy reason. I will give thee time
To cool, and take the counsel of thy judgment.
One hour thou haft to think.
(To Erick.) Condua him hence.

ALFRED.

Prudence requires that Hinguar too Ihould think.

Behold yon banners streaming to the wind,
Thehoft of England will revengetheir King.

Not likely to submit. Over his grave,

With looks so full of pity and of love !

My foul looks thro' my eyes. My love, my lord,
My king, my husband !

Oh ! thou fann'ft the fire,

On which my reason ashes heaps, in vain.
Like Hercules, I wear the poifon'd robe :
Thou pull'ft the garment; and my nerves are torn.
Why didft thou wish to fee the ruined Alfred ?

ETHELSWIDA.

Not ruin'd yet. His love endangered Alfred:
My love Ihall save him still.

ALFRED.

Can there be truth
In Hinguar ? Now, my foul begins to fear.

ETHELSWIDA.
What dost thou fear ?

ALFRED.

The weakness of thy sex.

ETHELSWIDA.

The weakness of my sex !--I guess thy thoughts.
Whatdid the tyrant fay of Ethelfwida ?

ALFRED.

What I defpis'd, discredited, and fcorn'd.

He said, that he had fought aud won thy love:
That thou confented'ft to become his bride.

ETHELSWIDA.
On what conditions ?

C z ALFRED.

ALFRED.
Then, thou did'ft consent!
Hear ! men and angels hear !

ETHELSWIDA.

Angels and men,

And Alfred, hear and judge. To save thy life,
To ftopthe bloody tyrant's lifted arm,
I didconfent, on this express condition,
That Hinguar, instantly, fliou'd set thee free.
When certain of thy safety, Alfred, then,
I was prepar'd and arm'd to mock the Dane-
To die.

ALFRED.

Forgive me, noblest of thy sex;

Greater than fancy'd heroine of the song;
Forgive the wrong I offer'dto thy virtue.

ETHELSWIDA.

Accept thy fieedol ; letmy handreftore

The king of England to his injur'd people,
Robb'd of their hero, by my luckless love.
And when the time fliall come, as come it will,
Unless the planet of this hour shou'd strike,
That Alfred his predicfed fate fulfils;
And, in the circle of his empire fits,
With glory crown'd, rememberEthelfwida,
Who died, exulting, to preserve her Lord.

ALFRED.

Remember thee! This is no time to speak,

To ope the floodgates of my bursting heart.
Remember thee! Whatever be my fate,
Thou ne'er shall be forgot, while Albionlifts
Herhead above the waves. But know, my love,
That this barbarian never was sincere:
For other terms to me he has propos'd ;-
A Danish bride.

ETHELSWIDA.
To thee a Danifli bride!

ALFRED.
Or 'nIlant death, to follow the refusal.

ETHELSWIDA.
Alfred, thou liv'lt !-

ALFRED.

I live till he-returns.

For, .tho' I fcorn'd his offer, he persisted;
Gave me one hour more calmly to confider.-
The time's expired.

ETHEL S WIDA.
Thou mut not, shalt not die.
Rather-

A L F R-E D.

Rall is the counsel of affe.tion.

I know the charater of Hinguar well.
Nor life nor liberty will he bestow
On those whom he leas wrong'd. If I shou'd wed
The Danii. maid, I but embrace difllonour.
And periff with addition of disgrace.

ETHELSWIDA.
What meansthe crafty Dane ?

A L F R ED.

I think he meant

To circumvent the foul of Ethelfwida.
Should I consent to wed a Danifhbrida,
He hopesto rouze the woman in thy heart,.
And profit by the rage of flighted beauty.

ETHELSWIDA.

Perhaps, the women of his savage land

Have taught him, thus, to judge ofwomankind.
If they are like the clouds, that change their form,
And, careless, fly before each fliifting 'gale,
Far different is the foul of Ethelfwida.
Alfred, thy love is dearer than my life.
Dearer than both, is Alfred's life or fame.
In this extreme distress, remove me far;
Exclude me from thy thoughts ; suppose me dead;
And aa, as if I never had been born.

ALFRED.

Thy magnanimity gives edge to mine.

Rather than wed the Daniih maid, I die:
Yet to elude the deadly rage of Hinguar,
And wait the chances of the coming night,
Big with event--

And live or die with thee. To fly from her,
Were to confess myself the wretch she thinks me.

Whose life thy rash resentment now pursuer,
Is Alfred's bride, the princess Ethelfwida,
Born of a race dishonour never ftrain'd,
And to the ftri&eft rules of virtue bred.
My foul, O Queen, devoted to my Lord,
But one affection knows, and worse than death
Abhors the love of Hinguar. Thy protection
My sex demands and my misfortunes claim.
Embrace this fair occasion to be just,
And generously repair the cruel wrong,
Thy thougnts have offered to my spotless fame.

His royal presence warrants what he is.
Princess, the hatred and the fell intent,
With which, confessedly, at first I came,
Do not relate to thee, unlike in all,
To the imagin'd object of my wrath.
My error pardon; and my deeds ihall show
The pity, which I feel for thy misfortunes;
The high efeem, in which I hold thy virtue.

E THELSWIDA.

Thy pity for distress, thy love of virtue,

Nobly thy deeds may prove. Deliver Alfred
The victim of his love and of his virtue.
Long is the tale, too long to tellit now.
But Hinguar's voicehas doom'd my Lord to death.
Because to him he wou'd not yield his bride.
If then the cause of that decree offend thee,
Treat with the King of England, and prevent it.

RO L L O.

By Thor's right arm, the lady counsels well,

Renounce all thoughts of amity with Hinguar,
Who never will forgive thyfriends or thee,
The insult of this day.-Unite with England,
And give the nations peace.

Thy daring fouJ.

Soars to the highest pitch of bold emprize.
But will the Danish chiefs adopt thy counsel ?

ROLLO.
Make trial; prove their hearts; if they flould

faint,

Ruin abides them. They have gone too far,
With safety, torecede. If hewhodraws
His sword againif a King, away Ihould throw
The useless scabbard, what ought he to do,
Who draws his sword against a fell usurper,
Who dares not show the mercy of a Prince ?

To stand a wall between them and their purpose

Over that slender mound will burf amain:
Woman to woman is the feller foe.

Did I consent to Ethelfwida's death.

Impos'd this deed on myreluctant mind.

And, like a comet, from her tresses shook

Grant me those equal terms, I ak'd at sirss;
And to your arms I join the force of England.

Thy terms are more agreeable to Ronex,

Than those the policy of Denmark nam'd.
By Frea, eldest goddess of the Iky,
The ancient arbiter of human things,
I swear to the performance.

And to the Daniih chiefs announce thy purpose.
That is the way direct. Along-this path

She is the bond and cement of our friendship.

With loud appeals, with vows and protestations
Of purest innocence.-That ihut is near;

H IN G U A R.

Here, in his heart,

Unconquer'd ifill the pride of Hinguar dwells.
To die in battle is a warrior's death.
The hero fights and falls ; but never yields.
Hinguar has fought. From sea to sea, his sword,
Thro' England blaz'd, a meteor dropping blood.-
The wolf and eagle followed to the feast,
Tracking its course. The warrior, old in'arms.
The youthful chief, by many a virgin lov'd,
Lay reeking in their gore.

ALFRED.

As thou dofl now !

The virgin's and the widow's curse have found thee,
And laid in dust the troubler of the land.

No. Ethelfwida fell

By Ronex. Yet, altho' I killed her not,
Her death delights me. Saxon, Irejoice
At thy calamity. Happy my lot,
Compar'd with thine. To the Valkyrian maids
I go, to Oiin and the hallof joy.
Thou of thy love bereft, Ihalt waste thy days,
In lamentation, like the wretch who pines
By Hela's lake and drinks the poifoa'd tream,
Pour'd from the jaws offnakes. I laugh at thee,
And, likemyfathers, die. (dies.

ALFRED.

His dying voice

Of me prophetic spake. 0, Ethelfwida!
And Surrey too ! in Alfred's cause has fallen.

Like a tree, stript of bark and branch, I stand,
Bare on all fides, and naked to the storm. (falls.

And England's ruin. Bear mewitnefs, heaven !-

For thee, thou pride and glory of thy sex,
To give the nobleftproof of love-and live.

Deep on my heart engrav'd was the resolve,
Not to furvi ve thee in the storms of fortune.
That anchor held like fate.

Whence came that sign
Which friends and foes deceived ?

ETHELSWIDA.

True was the sign

Of

Of death. The wearer of my garnient died,
For me mistaken.

Which laid me low. Opprefs'd with grief I funk.

Compleat is Edwin's joy
To fee his Prince with love and glory crown'd.

A L FR ED.

The scene is ghastly, and with death deform'd.

In place more fitting, of our friends and foes
According to desert, we will decree.
The nations now are one; with Hinguar died
The enmity of England and of Denmark.
My people with their monarch lhall be blest
Whilst such a partner of my empire reigns.

ET H E L S W I D A.

Nor shall the story of the toils of Alfred,

Sink to oblivion, in the tide of time,
Or to posterity descend in vain.
From hence the people of the land he lo'd;
And future Princes of that land may learn,
Fearless to ftem the torrent of disaster,
And ne'er of England, or themselves, despair.
