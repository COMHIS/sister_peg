THE Circumrtances which attended the publication
of this Tragedy mark so strongly the character of
the age, and of the country in wrhich it appeared,
that they ought never to be forgotten. It w-as re,-
presented in the Edinburgh~ Theatre, at the close of
the jrear 1756, under the management of MTr. Digges,
who h7imself performz~ed the part of DOUGLAS. T'he
orthodox, both clergy and laity, in that city, and
throughout all Scotl~and, w~ere instantly alarmed. It
appeared to them a strange, and almost unaccountable
p~hoenome~non, that a minister of their church should
have been guilty of the crying sin of writing- one of
the mostC beaut);ifu dlraJmaic ~performances in the E~ng-
lish langruag-e. Inflammatory pamphlets, addvertsise-
ments, and handbills appeared. T~he presbytery of
Edinburgh denounced seven clergymen, who had
been present at the exhibition of the tragedy, to the
several presbyteries in which they resided. These
gentlemen confessed thie criminality of their own
conduct, submitted withl humility to the censures of
the church, and were forgiven. One of them, a
Smehnber of the presbytery of Edinburgh, was sus-
pended for some time, with every mark of disgrace,
fr-om the exercise of his ecclesiastical functions, al-
though he pleaded in alleviation of the charge,---"( that
"L he had gone to the play-house only once, and en-
"L deavoured to conceal himself in a corner, to avoid
"L giving offtnce; expressing his deep sorrow for what
6C he hiad done, and firm reso~lution to be rare Cir-

.All 2C3I~'~ ~ I ~I~; 6

"' cumspect for the future." ~Another of these gentle-
men, Der. Carlisle, a friend of the Author, who ven-
tured to attempt only a partial and faint vindication
of himself, was prosecuted in full-form., The Ar-
ticles of the Libel against him were three---his hav-
Ing gone into the company of Players---his directing
them during the rehearsal-- and, lastly, his having
been present at the representation of a tragedy,
which, in the -opinion of the Reverend Divines of
those days, contains dreadful oaths and mock pray-
ers, and encourages suicide. The cause went thro'
all the courts up to the General Assembly, and Dr.
Carlisle every wPhere met with censure and rebuke
from his incensed breth~ren.

In the mean time, the Alrch-offehnder, the ac-

ecomplished Author of all this scandal to the pious,
wtas commanded to appear bef'ore his presbytery at
Haddington, on the 5th April 1137. He obtained
a delay to the Ist of MJay thereafter, and during this
interval his tragedy wias presented with great ap-
plause at London in Covent-garden Theatre. Find-
ing it impossible to soften the stern spirit of the
Presbyterian Church, he' thought proper, in order
to avoid a formal degradation from his office, to
preach to his congregation at Athelstonford, his
f'arewrell sermon, which is said to have drawn tears
from the eyes of the people; and two days thereaf·
ter, he resigned his charge to his presbytery at Had-
din gton.

Notwithstanding all this, howvever, w-hen wre re-

gard M~r. HoyME as holding a place among the list
of British Poets, his destiny has been fortunate and
happy. A pension from the Crowvn, which he ob-

tained by means of the late E. of BUTE, and' the place
of Scots Conservator at Campvere, wh-ich he was
permitted to -dispose of to advantage, amply consoled
him for the 14~ss of the very moderate emoluments of
a Scotch minister. H~e has also enjoyed a singular
piece of felicity, which falls to the lot of few. He
has not only seen his reputation flourish in his own.
days, but he has even lived to see the narrow preju-
dices of his country pass away. The Clergy of the
Church of Scotland, who once persecuted Mr. Home,
now reg·%rd it: as one of the highest honours of their
order, to have numbered among its members the Au-
thor of the Tragedy of DOUGLAS.

It may perhaps be proper to add, as a curious

fact, that notwithstanding the great inte~rest of the
lAuthor, IVir. GuARRcK refused to bring forward this
tragedy at Drury-lane as too simple and undramatic.
But this celebrated performers had the mortificatiorr
to see it immediately introduced at Covent-gardena
with the greatest success; a success that seems ra-
ther to increase than to diminish by the course of

years.

Elnter r.Aer RANnoLPe.

Ya8 w5~oods and w~ilds, w~hose melancholy gloota
Accords. with my soul's sadness, and draws forth
The voice of sorrow from my bursting heart,
Farewj~ell a wihile : I will not leave yTou lonlg;
For in your shades I deem some spirit dwells,
Wiho from the chiding stream, or groaning oak,
Still hears and answers to Mdatilda's moan.
O Douglas ! D~ouglas ! if departed ghoasts
Ahre e'er permitted to review this world,
W-ithin the circle of that wrood thou art,
And with the passion of immlortals hear'st
Mky lamentation : hear'st thy wretched wvife
WJeep for her husband slain, haer infa3nt lost.
M vy b~rother's timeless death I seem to moura,
Weaho perish'd with thee on this fatal day :
To thee I lift my voice ; to thee address
The plaint which mortal ear has never heard.
O disregard me not ; though I am call'd
Anoth~er's now, my heart is wholly thine.
Incapable of change, affection lies
B~uried, my Doug~las, in thy bloody grave.

But Randolph comes, whom fate has made my Lord,
To chide my anguish, and defraud the dead.

Enter RANDOLPH.,

RAN. Again these weeds of woe ! say, do st thou well
To feed a passion which consumes thy life ?
The living claim some duty; vainly thou
B1estow'st thy cares upon the silent dead.

LADY RAN. Silent, alas ! is he for whom I mourn :

Childless, without memorial of his name,
He only now in my remembrance lives.
' This fatal day stirs my time-settled sorrow,
' Troubles afresh the fountain of my heart.

' RAN. WChen was it pure of sadness ! These bilack

wTeeds

L Express the woonted colour of thy mind,
' For ever dark and dismal. Seven lon~g years
' Are pass'd, since we were join'd by sacred ties :
' Clouds all the while have hung upon thy 'erow,
' Nor broke, nor parted by one gleam of joy.
' Timlie, that 1 :s out the trace of deepest anguish,
SAs the sea smooths the prints made in the sand,
' H7-as past o'er thee mn vain.

' LADY RAN. r Ilf time to come

SShould prove as ineffectual, yet, iny Lord,
SThou canst not blame me. When our Scottish youth
'Vy'd with each other for my luckless love,
' Oft I besought them, I- implor'd them all
' Naot to assail me with my father's aid,
' Naor blend their better destiny with mine.
' FIor melancholy had congoeal'd my blood,
' And froze affectiopn in my chilly breast.
' At last my Sire, rous'd wthrla the base attempt
' To force me from him, which thou rend'redst vain,
6 To his own daughter bow'd his hoary head,
' Ebesought me to commiserate his age,

' And vow'tid he should not, could not die in peace,
' Unless hfe saw me wedded, and secur'd
' Fromn violence and outrage. Then, my Lord !
' In my extreme distress I call'd on thee,
' Thee I bespake, profess'd my strong desire
' To lead a sin gle, solitary life,
' And begg'd thy nobleness not to demand
' Her for a wife whose heart was dead to love.
' H~ow thou persisted'st after this, thou know'st,
' And must: confess that I am not unjust,
N \or more to thee than to myself injurious.
L RAN. That I confess j yet ever must regret
SThe grief I cannot cure. W~ould thou wert no~t
SCompos'd of grief and tenderness alone,
SBut had'st a spark of other passions in thiee,
SPride, anger, vanity, the strong desire
SOs admiration, dear to woman-kind;
SThese might-ee~ntend with, and allay thy gr-isf,
A'~s meeting tides and currents smooth ouL ·t~h.

'LADY RAN. To such a cause the human mind oft owes

' Its transient calm, a calm I envjr not.

RAN. Sure thou art not the daughter of Sir 1Val-

colm :

Strong was his rage, eternal his reseigtment :
For when thy brother fell, he smil'd to hear
That Douglas' son in, the' same field was slain.

LADY RAN. Oh!i rake not up the ashes of my fathers:

I~mplacable resentment was their crime,
;BAnd grievous has the expiation been.

Contending with the Douglas, gallant lives
Of either house were lost ; my ancestors
Compell'd, at last, to leave their ancient seat
On Tiviot's pleasant banks; and now, of them
No heir is left. Had they not been so stern,
I had not been the last of all my race.

us.T Thy grief wrests to its purposes my words.

I ncenve ask'd of thee that ardent love
W~hich in the breasts of fancy's children burns.
Decent affection and complacent kindness
WVere all I wisch'd for ; but I wish'd in vain.
HIence with the less regret my eyes behold
The storm of war that gathers o'er this land :
If I sh~ould perish bgi the Danish sword,
Matilda wNould not shed one tear the more.

LADY RAN. Thou do'st not think so: woeful as I am,

I love thy merit, and esteem thy virtues.
But whither goest thou now ?

us., Straight to the camp,

Where every warrior on the tip-toe stands
Of expectation, and impatient asks
Each who arrives, if he is come to tell,
The Danes are landed.

~LADY* RAN. O, may adverse winds,

Far from the coast of Scotland, drive their fleet !
And every soldier of both hosts return
In peace and safety to his pleasant home!i

usN. Thou speak'st a wornan''s, hear a warrior's

wish :

Right from their native land, the stormy north,
aa~y the wind 'blow, till every keel is fix'd
Immoveable in Caledonia's strand !
Then shall our foes repent their bold rnvasion,
~And roving armies shun the fatal shore.
* LADY RAN. W~ar I detest ; but, war with foreign foes,

' W~hose manners,1anguag·, and whose looks are strange,
' Is not so horrid, nor to me so hateful,
' As that: which with our neighbours oft we wage.
' A river here, there an ideal 1)ne
· ]By fancy drawn, divides the sister kingdoms,
' On each side dwells a people similar,

SAs twins are to each other 5 valiant: both i
B~~oth for their valour famous throl' the world.
' Yet will they not unite their kindred arms,
' And, if they must have war, wage distant war,
' But w~ith each other ~fight in cruel conflict.
'G~allant in strife, and noble in their ire,
' The battle is their pastime. They go forth
' G~ay in the morning, as to summer sport ;
' Whrden ev'ningf comes, the glory of the morn,
' The youthful warrior is a clod of clay.
SThus fal1the prime of either hapless land :
A ~nd such the fr-uit of Scots and Eng~lish wars.

'RAN. I"ll hear no more : this melody would makre
A
t soldier drop his sword, and do~f his arms,
SSit down and weep the conquests he has made;
' Yea, (like a monk,) sing rest and peace in heav'n
' To souls of w~arriors in hi~s battle slain.'
Lady, farewell: I leave thee not alone;
Y onder com-es one whose love makes duty light.[Ex~t'r.

Entter ANNA.

ANN. F~orgive the rashness of your Anna's love :

UJrg'd by affection, I: have thus presum'd
To interrupt your sojitary thoughts;
A~nd warn you of the hours that: you neglect,
CAnd lose in sadness.

LAD)Y RAN. So to lose my hours

Is all the use I wish to make of time.

ANN. To blame thee, Lady, suits not with my state :

SBut sure I am, since deathn frst prey'd on7 man,
Ne~ver did sister thus a brother mourn.
What had your sorrows been ·if you had lost,
I:n early youth, the husband of your heart ?

LAnY usN. Oh !
ANN. Have I distress'd you with officious love,

And ill-tim'd mention of your brother's fate ?

Forgive me, Lady : humble tho' I am,
The minld I bear partakes not of my fortune :
So fervrently I love you, t~hat to dry
These piteous tears, I'd throw my life away.

LADY. RAN. W~hat power directed thy unconscious

tongue

To speak as thou hast done ? to name- *-

ANN. I know not :

But since my words have made my mistress tremble,
I. will speak so no more : but silent mix
My tears with hers.

LADY RAN. NJo, thou shalt not be silent.

I'll trust thy faithful love, and thou shalt be
Henceforth th' instructed partner of my woes.
But what avails it ? Can thy f~eble pity
Roll back the flood of never-ebbing time ?
Compel the earth and ocean to give up
Their dead alive ?

ANN. W~hat mleans my noble mistress ?
LAoY RAN. Didst thou not ask ·what had my sor-

rows been,

If I in early youth had lost a husband ?-
In the cold bosom of the earth is lodg'sd,
Mangl'd with wounds, the husband of my youth ;
~And in some cavern of the ocean lies
MNy child and his. -

ANN. O ! Lady, most rever'd !

The tale wrapt up in your amazing words h
Deign to unfold.

LAnY RAN. Alas ! an ancient feud,

Hereditary evil, was the source
Of my misfortunes. Ruling fate decr~eed,
That my brave brother should in battle save
The life of Douglas' son, our house's foe :
The youthful warriors vow'd eternal friendship.

Tso see the vaunted sister of his friend,
Impatient, Douglas to Balarmo came,
Under a borrowv'd name.--My heart he gain'd i
Nor did I long refuse: the hand he begg'd :
M~y brother's presence authoriz'd our marriage.
Three wreeks, three little weeks with wings of down,
Had o'er us flown, when my lov'd lord was casl'd
To fight his facher's battles ; and with him,
In spite of' all mny tears did Maalcolm go.
Scarce wrere they gone, when my stern sire was told
Thnat the false strang-er was Lord Douglas' son.
Frantic with rage thne B~aron drew his sword
Ahnd question'd me. Alone, forsaken, faint,
KZneeling beneath his sword, falt'ring I took
APn oath equivocal, that I ne'er would
1Ved one of Do-uglas' name. Sincerity !
Tkhou first of virtues, let no mortal leave
Thy~ onward' path, altho' the earth should gape,-
And from the gulph of hell destruction cry,
To take dissimulation's winding way.

ANN. Alas ! howvs few of womnan's f~earful kind

Durst own a truth so hardy i

LADYP RAN. Th<: fist truth

Is easiest to avow. This mloral learn,
This precious moral from my tragic tale.---
I~n a few days the dreadful tidings came,
.That Douglas and my brother both were slain.
M/y lord ! my life ! my husband !--mighty God I
W Ahat had I done to merit such af~iction ?

ANN. M/y dearest Lady ! M Iany a tale of tears

I've listen'd to; but never did I hear
A tale so sad as this.

LADY RAN. In the first days

Of my distracting grief, I found myself--
As women wish to be who love their lords.

But who durst: tell my father ?The good priest
WVho join'd our hands, my brother's ancient tutor,
WJith his lov'd M~alcolm, in the battle fell :
They two alone were privy to the marriage.
On slence aZnd concealment I resolv'd,
Till time should make my father's fortune mine.
That very night on which my son was born,
MCy nurse, the on~ly confident I had,
Set out with h~im to reach her sister's house:
B~ut nurse, nor infant have I ever seen,
O)r heard of, Anna, since that fatal hour.
l' My murder'd child i--had thy fond mother fear'd
' The loss of thee, she had loud fame defy'd,
' Despis'd her father's rag( her father's grief,
' And wander'd with thee th~ro' the scorning world.'

ANw. Not seen or heard of ! then perhaps he lives.
LADY RAN. Nol~. It was dark December : wind and rain

Had beat all night. Across the Carron lay
The destin'd road i and in its swrelling flood
My faithful servant perish'd with my child.
c O ! hapless son of a most hapless sire !--
* But they are both at rest; and I alone
a Dwell in this world of woe, condemn'd to walk,
' Lik~e a guilt-troubl'd ghost, my painful rounds :'
Nor has despiteful fate pe~rmitted me
The comfort of a solitary sorrow.
Tho" dead to love, I: was compell'd to wed
Randolph, who snatch'd me from a villain's arms ;
And Randolph now possesses the domains,
That by Sir Malcolm's death on me devolv'd;
Domains, that should to Douglas' son have giv'n
A baron's title, and a baron's power.
' Such were my soothing thoughts, wchile I bewrail'd2
' The slaughter'd father of a son unborn.
< And when that son came, Zlke a ray from hleav'n,

SWhich shines and disappears ; alas ! my child I
'How long did thy fond mother grasp the hope
SOs having thee, she knew not how, restor'd.
' Year after year hath worn her hope away;
' But left still undiminish'd her desire.

C LADY RAN, NMOt in this world: I have consider'd well

" Its various evils, and on whom they fall.
' Alas ! how oft does goodness wound itself,
' And sweet affection prove the spring of woe !'
O ! had I dy'd when my lov'd husband fell !
Had some good angel op'd to me the book
Of EProvidence, and let me read my life,
Mly heart had broke, when I beheld the sum
O1f ills, which one by one I have endur'd.

ANs. That. God, whose ministers good angels are,.

H~lath shut the book, in m~ercy to mankind;
But we must leave this theme ; Glenalvon comes :
I saw him bend on you his thoughtful eyes,
And hitherwards he slowly stalks his way.

LADY RAN. I: will avoid him. An ungracious person

Is doubly irksome in an hour like this.

ANN. Why speaks my lady thus of Randolph's heir ?
LADY RAN. ]Because he's not the heir of Randolph's

virtues.

Subtle and shrewd! he offers to mankind
Anl artificiaLimage of himself:
And he with ~ase Canl vary to the taste
Of different men, its features. ' Self-denied,
SAnd m~aster of his appetites he seems :
SBut his fierce nature, like a fox chain'd up,
SWatches twPeize unseen the wish'd-for prey,
' N~ever were vice and virtue pois'd so ill,
' ALSs in Glenalvon's unrelenting mind.

Yet he is brave and politic in in war,
And stands a oft in these unruly times.
W~hy I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter,
Stay, and detain him till I reach the castle.

AmN. O happiness ! where art thou to be found ?

They turn'd upon him ; but his a £ive arm
Struck to the ground, from whence they rose no more,
T7he fiercest two:; the others fled amain,
~And left him master of the ;bloody field.
Speak, Lady Randolph; upon beauty's tongue
Dwell acc~ents pleasing to th~e brave and bold :
Speak, noble dame, and thank him for thy lord.

LnY RAN. My Lord,I cannot speak what now Ifeel.

1V~y heart o'erflows with gratitude to heaven,
And to this noble youth, who; all unknown
To you and yours, deliberated not,
NJor paus'd at peril s but, humanely brave,
Fought on your fide against such fearful odds.
Have you yet learn'd of him whom we should thank ?
WCAhom~ call the saviour of Lord Rando '~s lif~e ?Z

RAN. I ask'd that question, and he answer'd not :

But Imust know, who my deliverer is. [To the/lranger.

SmR. A low-born man, of parentage obscure,

Who nought can boast but his desire to be
A soldier, and to gain a name in arms.

RAN. WJhoe'er thou art, thy spirit is ennobled·

B~y the great King of kings ! thou art ordain'd

And stampt a hero, by the sovereign hand
Of nature !--Blush not, flower of modesty
As well as valour, to declare thy birth,

smR. Mjy name is Nodrval : on the Grampian hills

Mdy father feeds his flocks ; a fru-gal swain,
WChose constant cares were to increase his store,
Anld keep his only son, myself, at hom~e:
For I had heard of battles, and I long'd
T-lo followm to the field some wNarlikre lord :
And heaven soon granted what my sire deny'd.
This moon which rose last night, round as my shield,
Had not y et fill'd her horns, when, by her light,
A band olf fierce barbarians' from the hills.,
Rush'd like a torrent down upon the vale,
Sweeping our flocks and herds. T'he shepherds fled
For safety and for succour. I alone,
With bended bow, and quiver full of arrows,
H~over'd about the enemy, and mark'd
The road they took 3 then hasted to my friends,
WThom, with a troop of fifty chosen men,
I met advancing. The pursuit I led,
Till we o'ertook the spoil-encumber'dt foe.
We fought and conquer'd ; E'er a sword was drawn,
An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,
Wiho wore that day the arms which now I wear.
Returning hor~ne in triumph, I disdait'"d
The shepherd's slothful life; and having heard
T'hat our good king had sumrnon'd his bold peers
To lead their warriors to the Carron side,
I left my father's ho~use, and took with me
A chosen servant to condudt my steps :-
Yon trembling coward, who forsook his master.
Journeying with this intent, I pass'd these towers,
And, heaven-directed, came this day to do
The happy deed that gilds my humble name.

RAN. THe ;S RS wise RS brave. R7S ever tale

W~ith such a gallant modesty rehears'd ?-
My brave deliv'rer ! thou shalt enter now
A nobler list ; and in a monarch's sight
Contend with princes for the prize of fame.
I will present thee to our Scottish king,
Whnose valiant spirit ever valour lov'd.
~Ha ! my M~atilda ! wherefore starts that tear ?'

L.AnY RAN. I cannot say : for various affe~tions,

And strangely mingled, in my bosom swell;
Yet each of them may well command a tear.
I joy that thou art safe:; and I admire
H~im and his fortunes, who hath wroughit thy safety ;
Yea, as my mind predidis, with thine his own. 2
Obscure and friendless, he the army sought,
Bent upon peril, in the range of death
Resolv'd to hunt for fame, and w sword
To gain distindlion which his birth deny'd.
In this attempt unknown he might have perish'd,
And gain'd, with all his valour, but oblivion.
Now, grac'd by thee, his virtue serv~es no more
Beneath despair. The soldier now of hope,
He stan'ds conspicuous : fame and great renown
Are brought within the compass of his sword.
On this my mind refltected, whilst you spoke,
And bless'd the wonder-working Lord of heaven.

Ras. ]Pious and grateful ever are thy thoughts !

M.IIy deeds shall follow where thou point'st the way.
Next to myself, and equal to Glenalvon,
In honour and command shall Nlorval be.

NoRw.r I know not how to thank you. Rude I am

In speech and manners : Necver till this hour
Stood I in such a presence; yet, my Lord,
There's something in my brealst, which makes me bold
To say, that Norval ne'er will shame thy favour.

LADY RANT. I will be sworn thou wilt not. Thfou shalt be
MPy knight ; and ever, as thou didst to-day,
W~ith happyT valour guard the life of Randolph.

usN. Well hast thou spoke. Let me forbid reply :

CTo Norval.

W~e are thy debtors still; thy high desert
Oe'rtops our gratitude. I must proceed,
Ats was at first intended, toa.the camp.
Some of my train, I see, are speeding hither,
Impatient, doubtless, of their lord's delay.
Go with me, Norval, and thine eyes s~hall see
The chosen warriors· of thy native land,
W~ho languish for the fight, and beat the air
WYith brandish'd swords.

NoRV. · Let us begone, my L~ord.
RAs. [To Lacdy Randolph.] About the time that

the declining sun

Shall his broad orbit o'er yon hill suspend,
ExpeBt us to return. This night once more
WCithin these walls I rest; my tent I pitch
To-morrow in the field. Prepare the feast.
Free is his heart who for his country fights:
He in th-e eve of battle may resign
SHimself to social pleasure : sweetest then,
WVhen danger to a soldier's soul endears
The human joy that never may return.

[Exeunt Randolph and Naorv5at

I.ADY RAN. HIis parting words have struck a fata)
St ruth.
O, Douglas ! Douglas ! tender was the time
W~hen we two parted, ne'er to meet again !
How many years of anguish and despair
H-3as heaven annex'd to these swift-passing houns
Of love and fondness ! Thaen my bosom's flame,

*Oft, as blown back by the rude breath of fear
' R.eturn'd, and with redoubled ardour blaz'd.'

AN., May gracious heaven pour the sweet balm of

peace

Into the wounds that fester in your breast !
For earthly consolation cannot cure them.

LADY RAN. One only cure can heaven itself bestow ;-
A grave-that bed in which the weary rest.
Wretch that I am! A las!i why am I so ?
AC~t every happy parent I repine !-
]Howr blest the mother of you gallant N~orval!i
She for a living husband bore her pains,
And heard him bless her when a man was born :
She nurs'd her smiling infant on her breast,
Trended the child, and rear'd the pleasing boy :
She, with affection's triumph, saw the youth
In grace and comeliness surpass his peers:
WC'hilst I to a dead husband bore a son,
And to th~e roaring waters g~ave my child.

ANm. Alas ! alas ! why will you thus resume

Your grief afr-esh ? r thought that gallant youth
W~ould for a while have won you from your woe.
On him intent you gazed, with a look
Much more delighted than your pensive eye
Has deign'd on other objeAs to bestow.

LADY RAN. Delighted, say'st thou ? OhZ even there

i~~ ~F mmne eye

o,"~und fuel for my life-consumring~ sorrow.
1 thr'ought, that had the son of JDouglas liv'd,
He mI-ight have been like this young gallant stranger,
And pair'd with him in features and in shape.
In all endowments, as in years, I deem,
MLy boy with blooming NoJrval might have numb3er'd.
W~hilst· thus I mus'd, a spark from fancy fell
Ona my sad h~eart, and kindled up a fondness

For this younag stranger wand'ring from hris home,
And like an orphan cast upon--my care.
I will protect thee, (said I to myself, )
WVith all my power, and grace with all my favour.

ANN. Sure hleaven will bless so gen'rous a resolve.

Yi~ou must, my noble dame, exert your power i
You mxust awake : devices will be fram'd,
And arrows pointed ·at the breast of Norval.
·LADSY RAN. G-lena2~lvo's false and crafty h~ead will work

Against a rival in his kinsman's love,
ILf I deter him not : I only can.
BSold as hre is, Glenalvon will bewtare
How he pulls down the fabric that I raise.
I'll 'oe the artist of young Norval's fortune.
"'Tis pleasing to admire i most apt was I
STo this affection in my better days;
T hough now I: seem to you shrunk up, retirsd
" Within the narrow compass of my woe.
H ave you not sometimes seen an early flower
O pen its bud, and spread its silken leaves,
T~o catch sweet airs, and odours to b~est~pw;
T hen, by thre keen blast nipt, pull in its leaves,
A tlnd, though still living, die to scent and beauty ?

LA4DYl RANu. And most certcain is my cause ofknowledge.
GLEN.What do yo~u know ? By the most blessed cross,

You much amaze me. No created being,
YSiourself except, durst thus accost Glenalvon.

LADY RAN. Is guilt so bold ? and dost thou make a merit
Of thy pretended meekness ? This to me,
W~ho, with a gentleness which duty blames,
Have hitherto conceal'd, what, if divulg'd,
WTould make thee nothing; or, what's worse than that,
An outcast beggar, and unpity'd too:
For mortals shudder at a crime like thine.

GLEN. TThy virtue awes me. First of womankind !

Permit me yet to say, that the fond man
W~hom love transports beyond strict virtue's bounds,
If he is brought by love to misery,
In fortune ruin'rd, as in mind forlorn,
Unpity'd cannot be. Pity's the alms
WThichE on such beggars freely is beffow'd;
Foer mortals know that love is still their lord,
And o'er th'eir vain resolves advances still:
As fire, when kindl'd by our: shepherds, moves
Throu~gh the dry? heath before the fanningf wind.

LADY RAhN. Res~erve these accents for some'other ear.

To love's apology I listen not.
Mar~k thlou my words; for it; is meet thou should'st.
His bravte deliv'rer Randolph here retains.
Perhaps his presence may not please thee well;
4Eut, at ·thy peril, prarctise ought against him.
Let not thy jealousy attempt to shakie
ACnd loosen the good root he has in Randolph;

WChose favourites I know th~ou hast supplanted.-
Thou look'~st at me, as if thou fain would'st pry
Into my heart. 'Tis open as my speech.
I give this early caution, and put on
The curb, before thy temper breaks away.
Thle friendless stranger my protection claims :
His friend I am, and be not t~hou his foe. · [Exit,.

And be the shallow fbol of coward conscience !
I am not what I have been : what I should be.
~The darts of destiny have almost pierc'd
My marble heart. Had I one grain of faith
In holy legends and religious tales,
I should coinclude ·there wtas an arm above
T~hat foughti against me, and malignant turn'd,
To catch myself, the subtle snare I set.
W~hy, rape: and murder are not simple means !
. T~h' imperfect rape to Randolph gave a spouse;
Ahnd the intended mrurder in~troduc'd
A favourite to hide th~e sun from me;

In his behalf. And shall I thus. be brav'd ?

Prepare yourself to meet her just revenge.

You speak with him. Your dignity, your fame,
A9re nlow at stake. TFhinkc of the fatal secret,
WT;hich in a moment fromt your lips may fly.

O save me, lady ! from these cruel men,
WVho have attack'd and seiz'd me; who accuse
Mb~e of intended murder. APs I hope
For mercy at the judgment seat of H-eaven,
The tender lamb, that never nipt the grass,
Is not more innocent than I[ of murder.

Lany RAN. Of thiS mnan's guilt what proof can ye

produce ?

Ist SERV. WCCe found him lurking in the hollow glen.

WThen viewr'd and call'd upon, amaz'dl he fled :
Wc7e overtook himr, and enquir'd fr~om whence
~And w~hat: he was : Hle said he cai~itagom far,
~And wAas upon his journey to the camp 7t.,~~·

Not satisfied with this, we search'd his clothes,
And found these jewels, whose rich value plead
IV~Iost powerfully against him. Haprd he seems,
And old in villainy. Permit us ·t'r

'Which these w~eak; hands, I swear, did ·ne'er assailg
Ahnd by your child~ren's welfare, spare my age !
Let.not the iron tear mny ancient joints,
~And my grey hairs bring to the grave with pain.

LAD~Y RAN. AccouZnt for these 3 thine own they can-

not be :

For these, I say : be stedfast to the truth;
D~etected falsehood is most certain death.

[ Anna remaoves th5e servants, and ne~turnms

PRus. Alas ! I'm sore beset ! Let never man,

For sake of lucre, sin against his soul !
Eternal justice is in this most just I
I, guiltless now, must former guilt r-eveal.

LADY RAN. O ! Anna, hear !--Once more I charge

thee speak

The truth direct; for these to me foretel,
APnd certify a part ·of thy narration ;
Wi~ith which, if the remainder tallies not,
An instant and a dread~ful death abides thee.

PRas. Then, thus adjur'd, I'll speakr to you as just

As if you were the minister of heaven,
Sent down to search the secret sinls of men.--
Some eigh~teen years ago I rented land
Of brave Sir M~alcolm, then 1Balarmo's lord;
But falling to decay, his servants seiz'd
All that I had, and then turn'd me and mine,
(Four helpless infants and their weeping mother)
Out to the mercy of the winter winds.
A little hovel by the rivJer's side

Receiv'd us :· there hai-d labour, and the skill
In fishing, which was formerly my sport,·
Supported life. Whilst thus we poorly liv'd,
One stormy night, as I remember well,
The wind and rain beat hard upon our roof :
RBed came the river down, and loud and oft
The angry spirit of the water shriek'd.
At the dead hour of night was heard the cry ·~
Of one in jeopardy. I: rose, and ran
To where the circling eddy of a pool,
Beneath the ford, us'd oft to bring within ~
M~y reach, whatever floating thing the stream
Had caught. The voice was ceas'd ; the person lost :
But, lookiing sad and earnest on the waters,
By the moon's light I saw, whirl'd round and round,
A basket : soon I, drew it to the ban-k;,
And, nestled curious, there an infant lay.

LADY RAN. Whas he alive ?l
PR-is. He was.
LADY RAN. Inhuman that thou ~art !

How could'st thou kill what waves and tempests

spar'd ?-

PRas. I was not so inhuman.
LA9DY RA~N. IDidst thou not ?
ANN. MVy noble mistress, you are mov'd too 4such,

This man has not the aspect of stern murder :
Let him go on ; and you, I hope, will hear
Good tidings of your kinsman's long lost child.

miPas. The needy man who has known better days,

One whom distress has spited at the world,
Is he whom tempting Fiends would pitch upon
T'o do such deeds as make the prosperous moen
Lift up their hands and wonder who could do them.a
,And such a man was I : a man declin'd,
W5ho saw7 no end of black adversity :

Yet, for~the wealth of kingdoms, I would not
Have touch'd that infant with a hand of harm.

LADY RAN. Ha ! dost thou say so ? Then perhaps he

lives !

mi1s. Not many days ago he was alive.
x.AnY RAN. O God of heaven! Did! he then dfie so

lately ?

PRus. I did not say he died; I hope he liv-es.

Not many days ago these eyes beheld
H~im, flourishing in youth, and health, and beauty.

LADY RAN. W5rhere is he now ?
PRas. _ Alas ! I know not where.
LADY RAN. Oh, fate ! I fear thee still. Thou riddler,

speak

?Direct and clear, else I will search thiy soul.

' ANN. IPermit me, ever honour'd i Keen impatience,
T'phough hard to be restrain'd, def`eats itself.-'3

'Within the cradle where the infant lay
W9as stow'd a mighty store of gold and jewels ;
Tempted by which, we did resolve to hide,
From all the world this wonderful ezvent,
Aind like a peasant breed the noble child.
Tphat none might mark the change of our estate,
Wre left the country, travell'd to the north,
Bought flocks and herds, and gradually brought forths~
Our secret wealth. But G~od's all-seeing eye
Beheld our avarice, and smote us sore.

not feign !

TPhe tear stands in thine eye : such love from thee

Thou told'st the story of thy own distress.

PRas. Sir M~alcolm of our barons was thle flower j

The fastest friend, the best, the kindest master.
But ah!i he knewv not of my sad estate.
After that battle, where his gallant son,
Y5our own brave brother, fell, the good old lord
~Grew desperate And reckless of the world :
Ahnd n~ever, as he erst was wont, went forth
Tso overlook the conduct of his servants.

Rememnb'rest thou a little lonely hut,
That like a holy hermitage appears
Among the clefts of Carron ?

PRas. I remember

The cottage of the clefts.

LADY RAN. 'Tis that I meanP.

There dwells a man of venerable age,
Who in my father's service spent his youthr :
Tell him I sent thee, and with him remain,
'Till I shall call upon thee to declare,
Before the king and nobles what thou now
TSo me hast told. N~o morepbut this, and thou

Thy son so long shall call thee father still,
Ahnd all the land shall bless the syan who sav'd
The son of D~ouglas, and Sir M/alcolm'ls heir.
Remember well my words; if thou shouldst meet
Him whom thou call'st thy son, still call him so;
And mention nothing of his nobler father.
PRas. Fear not that I shall mar so fair an harvest,
By putting in my sickle ere 'tis ripe.
Why did I leave my 'home and ancient dame ?~
To find the youth, to tell him all I knew,
And make hirix wear these jewels in his arms,
Which might, I thought, be challeng'd, and so bring
To light the secret of his noble birth.

Tho' chance combin'd some likelihoods against him.
He is the faithful bearer of the jewels

'Tis meet that you should put him on his way,
Since your mistaken zeal hath dragg'd him hither.

And tower'd up to the region of his sire.

AmN. H-ow fondly did your eyes devour the boy !

Mysterious nat~ure, with the unseeni cord
Of powerful instinct, drew you to your own.

Suppress'd my fancy quite ; nor did he owe
To any likeness my so sudden favour :
But now I long to see his face again,
Examine every feature, and Eind out
Th~e lineaments of Douglas, or my own.

W~ho hiis true parents are, to clasp his necki,
And tell him all the story of his father.

This night I purpose with my son to meet,
Rieveal the secret, and consult writh him:
For wise he is, or my fond judgmnent errs.
As he does now, so look'd his noble father,
Array'd in nature's ease : his mien, his speech,
T~Bere sweetly simple, and full oft deceiv'd

A ~mazing· Bass ! looks o'er a fertile land.

SHas not eff'ac'd the image of a place,
SOnce perfect in my breast, there is a wild
v~Vhich lies to westward of that mighty rock,
A tnd seems by nature formed for the camp
' Of water-wafted armies, whose chief strength
' L;ies in firm foot, unflank'd with warlike horse :
' If martial skill directs the Danish lords,
C There inaccessible their army lies
' To our swift-scow'ring horse; the bloody fieldr

LADY RAN. Hrow many mothers shall bewail their

Hfow many widows weep their husbands slain !
Ye dames of Denmark ! even for you I feel,
Who, sadly sitting on the sea-beat shore,
Long look for lords that never shall return.

GL~EN. Oft has th' unconquer'd Caledonian sword

Come, as I hope, to meet their father's fate.

Loud-yelling fury, and life-ending pain,

Reproach more piercing than the pointed· sword.

LADY RAN. I scorn thee not, but when I ought to.

LADY RAN. Alas ! iiny Lord ! I've heard unwelcome

news ;

Tfhe Danes are landed.

RAN. Ay; no inroad this

O~f the N~orthum-obrian bent to take a spoil:
N\o sportive war; no tournament essay
Of some young knight resolv'd to break a spear,
And stain with hostile blood his maiden arms.
The Danes are landed : WYe must beat them lback,
Or live tite slaves of Denmark.

LADY RAy. Dreadful~times !
RAN. Thk fenceless villages are all forsaken:

The tremblitag mothers, and their children lodg$'d,
In wall-girt towers and castles; whilst the men
Retire indignant, Yet, like broken waves,
They but retire more awful to return.

LADY RAN. immenSe, aS fame reports, the Danish host !

An army knit like ours would pierce it throug~h :
"Brothers, that shrink not froma each other's side,
And fond companions, fill our warlike files :
For.his dear offspring, and the wife he loves,
The husband and the fearless fathrer arm.
In vulgar breasts heroic ·ardour burns,
Aind thle poor peasant mates his daring lor-d,.

LADY RAN. IMden'S minds are temper'd, likre their

They joy to rear erect their daring: forms.
Hence early graves ; hence, the lone widow's life ;
And the sad mother's ~grief-embitter'd age.--l
Wdhere is our gallant guest ?

W~hose st~ubborness had foi~l'd the strength and skill
O~f every rider. But behold he comes
In earnest: conversation with Glenalvon.

And lead my troops that lie in yonder vale :
Private I travel to the royal damp.
Nyorval, thoul goest with me. ~But say, young man i
Wh~Tere didst thou learn so to discourse of war,
And in such terms, as I o'erheard: to-day ?'
WT;ar is no village science, nor its phrase
A language taught among the shepherd swains.-

h'oii. Small is the skill my Lord delights to praise

I'n himr he favoucrs.-H~-ear froml whence it camne.
Beneath a mountain's brow, the most remote
And inaccessible by shepherds trod,
In a deep cave, dug by no mortal hand,
AB hermit liv'd; a melancholy man,
Whro was the wonder of our wand'ring swains,
Au~stere and lonely, cruel to himself,
Did they report him : The cold earth hzis bed,
WSater his drink, his food the shepherd's aims.
I went to see him, and my heart was touich'd
Writh reverence and w~ith pity. M~ild he sp:r0:e,
And, entering on discoure, such stories tol.d
As4 madle me oft revisit~ his sad cell ;

IFor he had been a soldier in his youth,
And fought in ·famous battles, when the peers
Of Europe, by the bold Godfredo led,
Against th' usurping infidel display'd
T'he blessed cross, and won the Holy Land.
P~leas'd with my admiration, and tlhe fire
His speech struckr from me, the old man would shake
His years away, and act his young encounters :
Then, having shew'd his wounds, he'd sit, him down,
.And all the live-long day discourse of war,
To help my fancy, in the smooth green turf
He cut the figures of the marshall'd hosts ;
D~escrib'd the motions, and explain'd the use
Of the deep column, and the lengthen'd line,
T'he square, the crescent, and the phalanx firm :
JFor all that ·Saracen or Christian knew
Of war's vast art, was to this hermit known.

usN. Why did this soldier in a desert hide

Those qualities that should have grac'd a camp ?

NoRV. That too at last I learned. Unhappy man !

Returning homewards by MR/essina's port,
Loaded: with -wealth and honours brave'ly won,
A rude and boist'rous captain of the sea
Fasten'd a quarrel on him. Fierce they foug~ht :
The stranger fell, and with his dying breath
D~eclar'd his name and lineag~e-MnIighty Power !
The soldier cried, my brother ! O, my brother!
EAns usL. His brother I
NORV. Yes , of the same parents born :

Hisg; only brother. They exchang'd forg~iveness y
And happy, in my mind, was he that dy'd ;
For many deaths has the survivor suffer'd.
In1 the wild desert on a rock he sitp,
Or on some nameless stream's untrodden banks,
Andc ruminates all day his dreadful ,Fate.

At times, alas ! not in his perfect mind,
Holds dialog~ues with his lov'd brother's ghost;
And oft each night forsakes his sullen couch,
Tdo makie sad orisons for him he slew.

LADYr RAN. TO What mysterious WOeS are mortals

born !-

In this dire tragedy, were there no more
Unhappy persons ? Did the parents live ?

E;oR. NTo they were dead : kind heav'n had clos'd

their eyes

Before their son had shed his brother's blood.

Remote from war's alarms his pastures lie,
By mountains inaccessible secur'd i
'Yet foremost he into the plain descends,

3Eager to bleed in battles not his own.

Prone to encounter peril, and to lift
Against each strong antagonist the spear--

I might have been a shepherd all my days,
And stole obscurely to a peas~ant's grave.
N~ow, if I live, with mighty chiefs I stand ;
iAnd, if I. fall, with nozble dust I lie.

LADY RAN. There is a gen'rous spirit in thy breast,

T~hat could have well sustain'd a prouder fortune.
This way with me : under~yon spreading beech,
U~nseen, unheard, by human eye or ear,
I will amaze thee with a wond'rous tale.

NoRV. Let there be danger, lady, with the secret,

That I may hug it to my grateful heart,
A8nd prove my faith. Command my sword, my life;
These are the sole possessions of poor Norval.

NoRV. Ah me, unhappy ! e'er myself was born !·-

But does my mother live ? I may conclude
~From my own fate, her portion has been sorrow.

LAnv RAN. She lives; but wastes her life in constant

woe,

W~eeping her husband slain, her infant lost.

NoRV. You that are skill'd so well in the sad story

Of my unhappy parents, and with tears
Bewail their destiny, now have compassion
Ifpon the offspring of the friends you lov'd;
O ! tell me who and where my mother is.
O~ppress'd by a base world, perhaps she bends
Beneath the weight of other ills than grief ;
And, desolate, implores of heaven the aid
Her son should give. It is, it must be so-
Yrour countenance confesses that she's wretched.
O ! tell me her condition! Can the sword--
WhVlo shall resist me in a parent's cause ?'

All that I owe thy sire, I pay to thee.

Checking the love and fondness of a son :
Yet I was filial to my humble parents.
But did my sire surpass the rest of men,
As thou excellest all of womankind ?

The autumn of my days is come already;
For sorrow made my summer haste away.

3His eyes were like the eagle's, yet sometimes
Likrer the dove's; and, as he pleas'd, he won
All hearts with softness, or with spirit aw'd.

When Douglas died. O ! I have much to ask.

tale

Of all thy father's and thy mother's woes.
At present this : T~ho~u art the rightful heir
Of yonder castle, and the wide domains
WVhich now Lord Randolph, as my husband, holds. f
But thou shalt not be wrong'd; I have the power
To right thee still. Before the king I'll kneel >
And call Lord Dougl-as to protect his blood.

NoRV. The blood of Douglas will protect itselfr.
LADY RAN. But we shall need both friends and favour,

boy,~

To wrest thy lands and lordship from the gripe
Of Randolph and his kinsman. Yset I thnink
May tale will move each gentle heart to pity;

Inheritance enough. D~eclare my birth,
And in the field I'11 seek for fame and fortune.

The noblest blood of all the land's abash'd,
Having no lacquey but pale poverty.
Too long hast thou been thus attended, Douglas !
Too long hast thou been deem'd a peasant's child.
The wanton heir of some inglorious chief
Perhaps has scorn'd thee in the youthful sports;
Whilst thy indignant spirit swell'd in vain !
Such contumely thou no more shalt bear;
But how I purpose to redress t~hy wrongs
M~Iust; be hereafter told. Prudence directs
That we should part before yon chiefs return.
Retire; and from thy rustic follower's hand
R~eceive a billet, which thy mother's care,
Anxious to see thee, dictated before

Of private conference. Its purport mark s.

LADY RAN. At hand, conceal'd he lies,

An useful witness. But beware, my son,
Of yon Glenalvon : In his guilty breast.

To false conjecture. He hath griev'd my heart.

WC~hich in the wilderness so long conceal'd
The blossom of thy youth.

DOUG. Not WorSe the fruit,

Thiat in the wilderness the blossom blow'd.
Amongst the shepherds, in the humble cot,
I learn'd some lessons, which I'll not forget
Wh~en I inhDabit: yonder lofty towers.
I, who was once a swain, will ever prove
The poor man's friend; and when my vassals bow,
NEorval shall smooth the crested pride of Douglas.

o. NoR. Let me but live to see thine exaltation ! -

Yet grievous are my fears. O leave this place,
And those unfriendly towers.

Doua. W~hy should I leave them ?
0. NoRV. Lord Randolph and his kinsman seek your

life.

DOUG. HE-ow know'st thou that ?
0. N oR. I will inform you how.

'When evening came, I left the sqcred place
Appointed for me by your mother's care,
And fondly trod in each accustom'd path
That to the castle leads. WVhilst thus I rang'd,
I[ was alarm'd with unexpected sounds
Of earnest voices. On the persons came :
Un-seen I lurk'd, and overheard them name
Each other as they talk'd; Lord Randolph this,
And that Glenalvon : still of you they spoke,
IAnd of the lady : threat'ning was their speech,
Though but imperfectly my ear could hear it.
'Twas strange, they said, a wonderful discov'ry j
Atnd ever and anon they vow'd revenge.

DOUG. Revenge ! For what ?
0. NoRV. For being what you are,

Sir Malcolax's heir ; Hfow else have you offended &

WCahen they were gone, I hied me to my cottage,
And there sat musing how I best might find
M~eans to inform you of their wicked purpose;
But I could think of none. At last, perplex'd,
I issued forth, encompassing the tower
WVith msiny a weary step and wishful look,
N~ow Providence hath brought you to my sight,
]Let not your too courageous spirit scorn
TFhe caution which I give.

DOUG. I SCOrn it DzOt.

May mother warn'd me of Glenalvon's baseness :
But I will not suspect the noble Randolph.
In our encounter with the vile assassins
I mark'd his brave demeanor; him I'll trust,

0. NoRV. I fear you will, too far.
DOUG. Here in this place

I wait my mother's coming : she shall know
WhVat thou hast told; her counsel I: will follow:
And cautious ever are a mother's counsels.
You must depart; your presence may prevent:
Our interview.,

0. Kowv. My blessing rest upon thee i

O may heav'n's hand, which sav'd thee from the wave
And -frorm the sword of foes, be near thee still,
Turning mischance, if ought hangs o'er thy head,
All upon mine ! [E~rit.

DOUrG. He loves me like a parent )

And must not, shall not, lose the son he loves,
Although his son has found a nobler father.--
Eventful day, how hast thou chang'd my state !
Once on the cold and winter-shaded: side
Of a bleak hill, mischance had rooted me,
N~ever to thr~ive, child of another soil.
Transplanted now to the gay sunny vale,
Likre the green thorn of May Imy fortune flowers.

YTe glorious stars i highl heav'n's resplendent'--- hot
To whom I: oft have of my lot complain'd,
H-ear and record my soul's unalter'd wish !
Dead or alive, let me be but renown'd.
MT~ay heav'n inspire some fierce gigantic D~ane
To give a bold defiance to our host !
Before he speaks it out, I will accept :
Like Douglas conquner ! or, like ~Doug~las die.

Enter LADY RANDOLPH.

LADY firA. Ml~y son ! I heard a voice·-
DOUG. 1110 VOICE WaS mine,
L AnY am. D8idst thou complain aloud to Nt~ature's

ear,

That thus in dusky shades at midnight hours,
By stealth the mother and the son should meet.

[ Embracinag hzim.

DOUG. NO : on this happy day, this better birth-day,

My thoughts and words are all of hope and joy.

LADY RAN. Sad fear and melancholy still divide

The empire of my- breast with hope and joy.
Now hear what I advise.

DOUG. First, let HIC tell

W~hat may the tenor of your counsel chnange.

LADY RAN. My heart forebodes some evil.
coUG. TiS DOt good--

A4t eve, unseen by Randolph and Glenalvon,
The good old Nosrval in the grove o'erheard
,Their conversation : oft they mention'd me
WCi'th dreadful threat'nings; you· they sometimes

nam'~d.

'Twas strange, they said, a wonderfuzl discov'ry;
And ever and anon they vow'd revenge.

LaDv RAN. D~efend us, gracious God ! we are betray'd,
They have found out the secret of thy birthi.
It must be so. That is the great discov'ry.

Sir M~alcom's heir is comle to claim his own ;
A~nd they will be reveng'd. Perhaps e'en now,
Atrm'd and prepar'd for murder, they but wait:
A darker and more silent 'hour, to break
Into the chamber where they think thou sleep'st.
TShis momaent,this, heav'n hath ourdain'd to save thee i
Fly to the camp, my son !

Dova. And leave you he~re ?~

No : To the castle let us go together ;
Cazll up the ancient servants of your house,
Who in their youth did eat your father's bread ;
Th~en tell thlem loudly that I am your son.
If in the breasts of men one spark remains
Of sacred love, fidelity, or pity,
Some in your cause will arm. I ask but few
To drive those spoilers from my father's house.

LADY RAN. O nature, nature ! what can check thyt

force ?

Thou genuine offsIpring of the daring Douglas I
But rush not on destruction : save thyself,
And I am safe. To me they mean no harm.
T~hy stay brit risks thy precious life in vain.
That winding path conducts thee to the river.
Cross where thou seest a broad and beaten way,
WFhich, running eastward, leads thee to the camp.
Instant demand adraittance to Lord ]Douglas.
Shew him these jewels which his brother wore.
Thy look, thy voice, wrill make him feel the truth,
'Which I.by certain proof will soon confirm,

nowir. I yield me, and obey: But yet my heart

Bleeds at this parting. Something bids me stay
And guard a mother's life. Oft have I read
Of wond'rous deeds by one bold arm atchiev'd.
Our foes are two; no more; let me g. forth,
A4nd see if any shield can guard Glenalvan.

L.AD amh. If thou regard'st thy mother, or rever'st

Thy father's mem'ry, think of this no mor~e.
One thing I have to say before we part :
Long· wert thou lost; and thou art found, my childe
I~n a most fearfuil season. Wt5ar and battle
I: have great cause to dread. Too well I see
WVhich way the current of thy temper sets.
To day I've found thee. Oh i my long; lost hope !
]If thou to giddy valour giv'st the rein,
To morrow I may lose my son for ever.
"The love of thee, before thou saw~'st the light,
Sustain'd my life when thy brave father fell.
If thou shalt fall, I have nor love nor hope
In thlis waste world ! My son. remember me !

noUG. qhat Shall I say ? how can I: give you comfort ?

Tlhe God of battles ofT my life dispose
As may be best for you ! for whose dear sake
I will not bear myself as I resolv'd.
But yet consider, as no vulgar name,
That which I. boast, sounds amongst mairtial men,
How will inglorious caution suit my claim ?Z -
The post of fate unshrinking I maintain :
Mly country's foes must witness who I am.
On the invaders' heads I'll prove my birth,
Till friends and foes confess the genuine strain.
If in this strife 1 fall, bl~ame not your son,
W~ho, if he lives not honour'd, must not live.

LAv BAN. I will not utter what my bosom feels.

Too well I love tlhat valour whicht I warn.--
Farewell my son!i my counsels are but vain ) [Emnbracing.
Atnd as high heav'n hath will'd it, all must be. [~Separat~e.
