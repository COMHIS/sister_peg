An Address from DAVID HUME, Efq; uthorof the

Hiltory of Great-Britain, &c. to the Rev. Mr. HUME,
Author ofDOUGLAS, a Tragedy.

My dear Sir,
T was the Practice of the Antients to address their
Compositions only to Friends and Equals, and to

render their Dedications Monuments of Regard and
Affecion, not of Servility and Flattery. In those Days
of ingenious and and candid Liberty, a Dedication did
Honour to the Person to whom it was addressed, with-
out degrading the Author. If any Partiality appeared
towards the Patron, it was at least the Partiality. of
Friendship and AffeCtion.

Another Inllance of true Liberty, of which antient

Times can alone afford us an Example, is the Liberty
of Thought, which engaged Men of Letters, however
different in their abllract Opinions, to maintain a mutu-
al Friendfhipand Regard; and never to quarrel about
PrincipLes, while they agreed in Inclinations and Mlan-
ners. Science was often the Subjec of Disputation,
neverofAnimofity. Cicero, an Academic, addressed
his philosophical Treatiles, sometimes to Brutus, a
Stoic; fonietimes to Atticus, an Epicurean.

I have been seized with a strong Desire of renewing.

thefellaudable Practices ofAntiquity, by addrelling the
'ollowing Difrertations to you, my good Friend: For
such I evcr will call and eeem you, notwithflanding
the Opposition which prevails between us, with Re-
gard to many of our speculative Tenets. These Diffe-
lences of Opinion I have only found to enliven our
C.jiverfation; while our common Paflion for Science
and Lettcrs served as a Cement to our Friendflip. I
ill admired your Genius, even when I imagined that
you lay under the Influence of Prejudice; and you
olmetimes told nm, that vou cxcufcd my Errors, on

A z Account

[ 4

Account of the Candour and Sincerity, which, you
thought accompanied them.

But to tell Truth, it is less my Admiration of your

fine Genius which has engaged me to make this Ad-
dress toyou, than my Esteem of your Charater and
my Affecion to your Person. That Generosity of
Mind which ever accompanies you; that Cordiality of
Friendship, that spirited Honour and Integrity, have
long interested me flrongly in your Behalf, and have
mlade me desirous, that a Monument of our mutual
Amityflould be publickly ereCted, and, if poflible, be
preserved to Posterity.

I own too, that I have the Ambition to be the first

who fall in public express his Admiration of your noble
Tragedy of Douglas; one of the nmoi interesting and
pathetic Pieces, that was ever exhibited on any Theatre.
Should I give it the Preference to the Merope of Massei,
and to thatof Voltaire, which it resembles in its sub-
jet; flould I affirm, that it contained more Fire and
Spirit than the former, more Tenderness and Sinplici-
ty than the latter; I might be accused of Partiality:
And how could I entirely acquit myself, after the Pro-
feflions of Friendhlip which I have made you ? But the
unfeigned Tears which flowed from every Eye, in the
numerous Representations which were made of it on
this Theatre; the unparalleled Command, which you
appeared to have over every Affection of the human
Breast: These areinconteftible Proofs, that you possess
the true theatric Genius of Shakefpear and Otway, re-
fined from the unhappy Barbarism of the one, and Li-
centioufnefs of the other.

My Enemies, you know, and I own even sometimes

my Friends, have reproached me with the Love of Para-
doxes and singular Opinions ; and I expeC to be expoled
to the fame Imputation, on Account of the Character,
which I have here given of your Douglas. I shall be told
no doubt, that I had artfully chosen tlie only.Timie,
when this high esteem of that Piece could be regarded as
a Paradox, to wit, before its Publication ; and that not
being able to contradiC in this Particular the Sentiments
.es the Public, I have, at leaf, resolved to go before

Pleafantlies, if you accept this Teflimony of my Re-

ble Servant,

Edinb..Jan. 3, 1757, DAVID HUME.
Coby of the A,InJonitin and Exhortation by the Rever-

end Pref/lytepy of Edinburgh, dated the 5th Day of
January, 1757.

I-I E Presbytery taking into their serious Confide-
ration, the declining Stae of Religion, the open

Profanation of the Lord's Day, the Contempt of public
Worship, the growing Luxury and Levity of the present
Age; in which so many feenl Lovers of Pleasure, more
than Lovers of God : And being particularly affected
with the UNIPRrCEDENTED COUNTENANCE given of
late to the Playhouse in this Place, when the State of the
Nation, and the Circuniftances of the Poor, make such
hurtful Entertainments Iill more pernicious; judged it
their indilipenfable Duty to express in the nioft open and
folenin Manner, the deep Concern they feel on this
Occasion.

The Opinion which the Christian Church has always

entertained of Stage Plays and Players, as prejudicial to
the Intcrefts of Religion and Morality, is well known ;
and the fatal Influence which they commonly have on
the far greater Parn of Mankind, particularly the younger
Sort, is too obvious to be called in QLellion.

To enumerate how many Servants, Apprentices, and

Students in different Branches of'Literatu e, in the City
and Suburbs, have been seduced from their proper Bu-
fine's, by attending the Stage, would be a painful, dif-
agreeable Talk.

The Prelbytery in the Year 1727, when confifling of

many pious, prudent, and leained Ministers, whose
Praise is in all the Churches, being aware of these Evils,
did prepare a Paper, which was read from the several

A 3 Pulpits

6

Pulpits within their Bounds, warning their People a-
gainft the dangerous Infetion of the Theatre ten e-
reced there.

In the Year 1737, the Legillature, in their great

Wisdom, did by an Act of the othof George II. en-
act and declare, " That every Person who hould, for
" Hire or Reward, at, or caufetobe ated, any Play,

or other Entertainment of the Stage, without the
"' special Licence and Authority mentioned in the said

ACt, should be deemed a Rogue .and a Vagabond,

* and for every such Offence should forfeit the Sum of
*' 501. Sterling.

At that time a ProjeCt was set on Foot to obtain a

licensed Theatre in this City; but the Masters and Pro-
feflors of the University, Cupported by the Magistrates,
having prepared a Petition, setting forth the dangerous
Tendency ofa Playhouse here, with respeCt to the i-
portant Interests of Virtue and Learning, the ProjeCt
was laid aside. o

The Players, however, being so audacious as to

continue to at in Defiance of the Law, the Preibytery
did, at their own Charge, prosecute them before the
Court ofSeffion; and prevailed in the Process. The
Players were fined in Terns of Law; and Warrants be-
ing issued for apprehending them, they fled from Jus-
tice. But others came in their Place; who since that
Time have attempted to elude the Law, by changing
the Name of the PLAYHOUSE into that of the Con-
CERT-HALL.

As such a flight Evasion, the mere Change of a

Name, could not make the finalleft Variation in the
Nature of the Thing, the Preibytery continued to do
all in their Power, and in their Sphere, to prevent the
growing Evil ; and think themselves at this Time loud-
ly called upon, in ONE BODY, and with ONE V ICE,
toexpoftulate, in the Bowels of Love and Companlion,
with all under their Care and nfpecion.

When our gracious Sovereign, attentive to the Voice

ofProvidence, is calling From the Throne to Humilia-
tion and Prayer, how unseemly is it for his Subjects to

give

7 ]

give themselves up to Mirth and Jollity? When the
War in which we are engaged, and many awful Tokens
of the divine Displeasure, bespeak us, in the Language
of an inspired Writer, to redeem bte Time becarfe the
Days are evil, hould that Time be squandered away in
running the conifant Round offoolifi, not to ay sinful
ALlufements ? When the Wants and Cries of the nu-
merous Poor require extraordinary Supplies, how un-
accountable is it to laviih away vast Sums for such vain
and idle Purposes? When the Wisdom of the Nation
has guarded the Inhabitants of this City and Suburbs
from the Infeaion of the Stage, by a plain and express
Statute; is it nota high Inilance of Folly, to break
down that Barrier, and open a Door with their own
Hands for theatrical Representations ? which are in
many RespeCts no less inconfitlent with good Policy,
than unfriendly to Religion; and will be found soon-
eror later, to assec their temporal as well as spiritual
Interests.

Onthefe Accounts, and for many other obvious and

weighty Considerations, the Presbytery, warmed with
juif Concern for the Good of Souls, do in the Fear of
God, WARN, EXIHORT, and OBTEST, all within their
Bounds, as they regard the Glory of God, the Credit
of our holy'Religion, and their own Welfare, to walk
worthy of the Vocation wherewith they are called, by
shewing a sacred Regard to the Lord's Day, and all the
Ordinances of divine Institution ; and by discouraging,
in their refpeaive Spheres, the illegal and dangerous
Entertainments of the Stage.

The Presbytery would plead with ALL in Authority,
with TEACIERS of Youth, PARENTS and MASTERS
of Families, to reflrain by every habile Method, such
as are under their Influence, from frequenting these Se-
nlinaries of Folly and Vice. They would particularly
beseech the younger Part of their Flock, to beware, left
by Example, or from a foolilh Desire of appearing in
the fashionable World, they be misled into such perni-
cious Snares; Snares which must necessarily retard, if
not entirely mar, that Progress in the refpe&ive Parts of
their Education, on which their future Usefulness and

Success

Success depend. And, lasily, they would intreat and ob-
test Persons of all Ranks and Conditions, that, instead of
contributing to the growing Licentioulnefs of the Age,
they may dittinguifi thelifelves by hining as Lights in
the World, being hlamelefs and harnilefs, the Sons of
God, without Rebuke, in the MIidll of a crooked and
perverse Nation ; occUPYItG, for the great Purpoles
of the Honour oi God and the Good of Mankind, that
Time, that Substance, and thole other Talents which
they have received from their Lord and Master.

On the whole, the Presbytery do, in the most earnest

Manner, call upon all who have the Interest of Religion
at Heart, to plead fervently at the Throne of Grace,
in the prevailing Name of the great Mediator, until the
Spirit be pauredlupanp us from on high, and the ildler-

intitled, The Tragedy of Douglas, and gotit to be aed
on the Theatre at Edinburgh ; and that he, with feve-
ral other Ministers of this Church, were present, and
some of them oftner than once, at the ating of the said
'lay before anumerous Audience: The Prelbytery be-
ing deeply affected with this new and strange Appear-
ance, think it their Duty to declare, as they hereby do,
that they agree with the Presbytery of Edinburgh in
their Sentiments with refpea to Stage-Plays; and par-
ticqlarly that such Entertainments, from what has been
usually exhibited in them, and also from the difollute
Lives (for the most part) and infamous Characters of
the Players, have been looked upon by the Chriltian
Church in all Ages, and of all different Communions,
as extreanly prejudicial to Religion ard Morality, as
wellas hurtful to the other valuable Interests of human
Society, by the wasteful expence of Money and Time
they have occasioned; and being convinced by long
Experience, a ure Test of the Tendency of any A&ion
or Practice, how vain it is to expet such a Reformation
of the Stage as is consistent with the Ends aforesaid
and therefore such Entertainments should be discouraged
and laid aside: And the Presbytery further confidering,
that the unprecedented Countenance given to the Play-
house, in the Instance mentioned, is greatly aggravated
by a late Ad of Parliament, rendering the Stage (be-
cause not licensed) unlawful in Scotland, and allo from
the present Circumstances of the Nation with regard to
the War we are engaged in, the Dearth of Provisions,
and the awful Tokens of the Divine Anger against us:
They there!hre hereby appoint and inflruc such oftheir
lemihers as f(hll reprelsnt them in the ensuing general
Aflietilly of this Church, to move and infilf in a regular
Manner, that the venerable Aflyenbly do declare, by a
puhlick At, their Judgment and thnt of this National
Church againl the Entertainments of the Theatre, as
o 'very hurtful Tendency to the Interells of Religion
and Society. 2dlV, That the Aretilmly d.) ftritly en-
quire whether the Fts above-mentioned, viz. that a
Nlinilter of this Church has compoled and procured to

presentation of the said Tragedy was attended by him
and several other Ministers, have beer. under the Confi-
deration of the Presbyters respectively concerned; and
whether these Ministers, have been found guilty, have
been censured as their Faults deserved ; and to give
such Direcions as they in their Wisdom hall ind ne-
ceffary, that uch Miniilers and all others nmay be lenli-
ble that the Church of Scotland will never protect her
Members in Pracices so unbecoming their Chnracter,
and of such pernicious Ten,!ency to the great Inreretas
of Religion, ndulry and Virtue. And lastly, that the
Affenbly would use their bell Endeavours to obtain
such an Explication and Enforcement of the Act of the
l7th of Geo. II. anent the Playhouse, as it may not
be liable to the pitiful Evasions by which it is now
eluded,

The court of a caflle,furrounded with t'oods.

Enter Lady RANDOLr.r.

E woods and wilds, whole melancholy gloom
Accords with my foul's sadness, and draws forth
The voice ot sorrow from my bursting heart,

Farewel a while: 1 will not leave you long;
For in your hades I deeim some ipirit dwells,
V/ho from the chiding ltream, or groaningoak,
S;ill hears, and anivers to rMAIl L A'S 1'snoan.
O DOUGLAS ! DOUCI.AS! If departed ghosts
Are e'er permnitted to review this world,
Within the circle of that wood thou art,
And with the pallion of iniilortals hear'll
My lanlentrtion: henr'll thy wretched wife
\\ccep Ibr her hulband nfitin, her infialit loft.
.My brother's tiimelefs death I seem to mnourn,
\Vho pci ifli'd u ith thee on lthis fatal day.
'I'o dhe I lift Imy voice ; to thee addreis
The plaint which mortal ear has never heard.
Odil'regard ise not ; though I an call'd
Another's no., lmy heart is vwholly thine.

BI Incapable

Incapable of change, affection lies
Buried, my DOUGLAS, in thy bloody grave.
But RANDOLPH comes, whom fate has made my Lord,
To chide my anguish, and defraud the dead.

Enter Lord RANDOLPH.
Lord Ran. Again these weeds of woe fay, do'st thou

well

To feed a paflion which consumes thy life ?
The living claim fonme duty ; vainly thou
Beftow'ft thy cares upon the silent dead.

Lady Ran. Silent, alas ! is he for vhoin I mourn:

Childless, without memorial of his name,
He only now in my remembrance lives.

Lord Ran. Time, that wears out the trace ofdecpest

anguish,

Ilas pat o'er thee in vain. \ou'd thou wert not
Coupos'd of grief and tenderness alone !
Sure thou artnot the daughter ofSir MAI.COLM
Strong was his Rage, eternal his refntmelnt :
For when thy brother fell, he fniil'd to hear
That Do G LAS' on in the fame ield was slain.

Lady Ran. Oh ! rake not up the alies of my fathers:

Implacable resentment was their crime,
And grievous has the expiation been.
Contending with the Do L u ..s, gallant lives
Of either house were lo R; my ancestors
Compell'd, at lalt to leave their ancient leat
On Tiviot's plealant banks ; and now, of them
No heir is left. Had they not been so fern,
I had not been the lalt of all my race.

Lord Ran. Thy grief wrelts to its purposes my words,

I never allk'd of thee that ardent love,
Which in the brealls of fancy's children burns.
Decent affection, and complacent kindnels
Were all I wish'd for ; but I wilh'd in vain.
Hience xvith thee less regret ny eyes behold
The storm of war that gathers o'er this land:
If I (hould peri'f by the Danifli sword,
IMAl T D A would not (bed one tear the more.

Lady Ran. Thou do'lt not think so : woeful as I am,

I love thy merit, and esteem thy virtues.
But whither, goeft thou now ?

Lord

Lord Ran. Straight to the camp,

Where every warrior on the tip-toe sands
Ofexpectation, and impatient aks
Each who arrives, if e is come to tell
'The Danes are landed.
Lady Ran. 0, may adverse winds,

Far fron the coall of Scotland, drive their fleet!
Antl every loldier of both hosts return
In peace and safety to his pleasant home !

Lord Ran. Thou fpeak't a woman's, hear a war-

rior's wih :

Right from their native land, the stormy north,
May the wind blow, till every keel is six'd
linmoveablein Caledonia's strand!
Then shall our foes repent their bold invasion,
And roving armies hun the fatal hore.

Lady Ran. War I detest : but war with foreign foes,

Whose manners, language, and whose looks are Itrange,
Is not so horrid, nor to me so hateful,
As that which with our neighbours oft we wage.
A river here, there an ideal line
By fancy drawn, divides the sifter kingdoms.
On each fide dwells a people similar,
As twains are to each other, valiant both,
Both for their valour famous thro' the world;
Yet will they not unite their kindred arms,
And, if they muff have war, wage distant war,
But with each other fight in cruel conflit.
Gallant in Itrife, and noble in their ire,
The battle is their paftine. They go forth
Gay in the morning, as to summer sport:
When ev'ning comes the glory of the morn,
The youthful warrior, is a clod of clay.
Thlusf all the prime of either hapless land:
And fich the fruit of Scotch and English wars.

Lord Ran. I'll hear no more: this melody would

make

A soldier drop his sword, and doffhis arms,
Sit down and weep the conquests he had made;
Yea, (like a monk), sing reft and peace in heav'n
To fouls of warriors in his battle slain.

B z. Lady,

Lady, farewel: I leave thee not alone;
Yonder comes one whose love makes duty light.

Enter A N A.

Anna. Forgive therathnefs of your AN .x's love:

Urg'd by affection, 1 have thus prefun'd
To interrupt your solitary thoughts;
And warn you of the hours that you neglect,
And lose in fadnels.

Lady Ran. So to lore my hours
Is all the use I wish to make of time.

Anna. To blame thee, lady, suits not with ny fare:

But sure I am, since death irit prev'd on mail,
Never did filter thus a brother mourn.
What had your lorrows been if you had lotr,
In early youth. the husband or your heart ?

Lady Ran. Oh !
Anna. Have I diffreft you with officious love,

And ill-tim'd mention of your brother's fate ?
Forgive me, lady: humble tho' I am,
The mind I bear partakes not of my fortune;
So fervently I love you, that to dry
These piteous tears, I'd throw my life away.

Lady Ran. What power directed thy unconscious

tongue
To speak as thou haft done ? to namne-

Anna. 1 know not:

But since my words have made my miltrefs tremb!'e,
I will speak so no more ; but ilent mis.
My tears with hers.

Lady Ran. No, thou halr not be filrnr.

I'll trult thy faithlul love, antl thou lhalt be
Henceforth th' infiruCted partner of ly Woe.
But what avails it Can thy feeble pity
Roll back the flood of nevcr-cbbinl, time ?
Compel the earth and ocean to gic up
Their dead alive?

Anna. What iieans my noble mii:rel; ?
Lady Ran. Didtt thou not alk what had my lorruws

If I in eat ly youth had lolt a lhuband ?
In the cold bosom of the earth i lodg'd,

And in fonie cavern of the ocean lies

Lad)' Ran. Alas !an ancient feud,

Hereditary evil, was the lource
Of my mitforrunes. Ruling fate decreed,
That my brave brother hould in battle lavc

Nor did 1 long refuse the land he begg'd :
My brother's presence authoriz'd our marriage.
'Three weeks, three little weeks, with wings of down,
Had o'er us flown, when my lov'd lord was call'd
'o fight his father's battles; and with him,
In Ijpite of all my tears, did MNIA LcoL.a go.
Sca;ce were they gone, when my tern ire was told
That the falie tlranger was lord Dour LAS' son.

I've listen'd to; but never did I hear;
A tale so fad as this.

Lady Ran. In the firfi days

Of my distracting grief, I found myself-
As women wish to be who love their lords.
But who durst tell my father ? The good priest
Whojoin'd our hands, my brother's antient tutor,
With his lov'd MALCOLM, in the battlefell:
They two alone were privy to the marriage.
On silence and concealment I refolv'd,
Till time hould make my father's fortune mine.
That very night on which my son was born,
My nurse, the only confidant I had,
Set out with him to reach her fifler's house:
But nurse, nor infant, have I ever seen,
Or heard of, ANNA, since that fatal hour.
My murder'd child !-had thy fond mother sear'd
The loss of thee, he had loud fame defy'd,
Defpis'd her father's rage, her father's grief,
And wander'd with thee thro' the scorning world.

Anna. Not seen, or heard of ! then perhaps he lives.
Lady Ran. No. It was dark December : wind and

rain

Had beat all night. Across the Caron lay
The deftin'd road; and in it's welling flood
My faithful servant perifh'd with my child.
O hapless on ! of a most hapless fire !-
But they are both at ret ; and I alone
Dwell in this world of woe, condemn'd to walk,
Like a guilt-troubl'd Gholt, my painful rounds:
Nor has delpiteful fate permitted me
The comfort of a solitary sorrow.
Tho' dead to love, I was compell'd to wed
RANDOLPH, who fnatch'd me from a villain's arms
And RANDOLPH now poffefles the domains,
That by Sir MA LCOLM'S death on me devolv'd;
Domains that hould to Do uo LAs' Ibn have giv'n
A baron's title, and a baron's power.
Such were my soothing thoughts, while bewail'd
The flaughter'd father of a Ibn unborn.
And when that son came, like a ray from heav'n
Which Ihiues and difappearst alas wy child

How

How long did thy fond mother grasp the hope
Ofhavingthee, Ihe knew not how, refor'd.
Year after year hath worn her hope away;
But left fRill undiminifh'd her desire.

Anna. The hand, that spins th' uneven thread of life,
May smooth the length that's yet to come of your's.

Lady Ran. Not in this world: I have confider'd well

It's various evils, and on whom they fall.
Alas ! how oft does goodness wound itself?
And sweet affection prove the spring of woe.
O ! had I died when my lov'd husband fell !
Had ome good angel op'd to me the book
Of providence, and let me read my life,
My heart had broke, when I beheld the um
Of ills, which one by one I have endur'd.

Anna. That God whole ministers good angels are,

Hath Ihut the book in mercy to mankind.
But we mufft leave this theme: GLE N A LVON comes:
I saw him bend on you his thoughtful eyes,
And hitherwards he slowly italks his way.

Lady. Ran. I will avoid him. An ungracious person
Is doubly irksome in an hour like this.

Anna. Why speaks my lady thus of RANDOLPH'S

heir ?
Lady Ran. Because he's not the heir of RANDOLP 'S

virtues.

Subtle and shrewd, he offers to mankind
An artificial image of hiulelf :
And he with ease can vary to the taste
Ofdifferent men, it's features. Self-denied,
And nmaler of his appetites he feemns:
But his fierce nature, like a fox chain'd up,
Watches to seize unseen the wifled-for prey.
Never were vice and virtue pois'd tb ill,
As in GLEINALVON'S unrelenting mind.
Yet is he brave and politic in war,
And stands aloft in there unruly tinmes.
Why I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter:
Stay and detain him till I reach the caflle.

[Exit. Lady RANDOLPH.

Anna. 0 happiness ! where art thou to be found ?
I fee thou dwellet not with birth and beauty,

Tho' grac'd with grandeur, and in wealth array'd;
Nor dolt thou, it would seem, with virtue dwell;

Glen. What dolt thou muse on, meditating maid ?

like obme entranc'd and visionary eer
On earth thou ftand'st, thy thoughts ascend to heaven.

Anna. \Vou'd that I were, e'en as thou fay'd, a seer,
To have my doubts by heav'nly vision clear'd !

CGcn. W\hat dolt thou doubt of ? what haft thou to

do

With subje&s intricate ? Thy youth, thy beauty,
Cannot be quefioned : think of these good gifts;
And then thy contemplations will be pleasing.

Dwell

Dwell accents pleasing to the brave and bold.
Speak, noble dame, and thank him for thy lord.

Lady Ran. My lord, I cannot speak what now I feel.

My heart o'erflows with gratitude to heav'n,
And to this noble youth who all unknown
To you and yours, deliberated not,
Nor paus'd at peril, but humanely brave
Fought on your fide, againfl such fearful odds.
Have you yet learn'd of him whoim we hould thank?
Whom call the saviour of Lord RAN DO LP l'S life

Lord Ran. I ask'd that queflion, and he aniwerl'd not:
But I inuf know who mly Clel v'reris. (to the Stranger.)

Strung. A low born man, of parentage oblcure,

Who nought can boarf but his desire to be
A soldier, and to gain a name in arms.

Lord Ran. Whoe'er thou art, thy spirit is ennobled

By the great King of Kings! thou art ordain'd
And ftampt a hero by the sovereign hand
Of nature! blush not, flower of modefy '
As well as valour to declare thy birth.

Strung. My name is NORVAL : on the Grampian

hills

My father feeds his flocks ; a frugal wain,
Whose constant cares were toencreafe his store,
And keep his only son, myself, at home.
For I had heard of battles, and I long'd
To follow to the field some warlike lord;
And heaven soon granted what my fire denied.
This moon which rose last night, round as my ihield,
Had not yet fill'd her horns, when by her light,
A band of fierce barbarians, from the hills,
Rufli'd like a torrent down upon the vale,
Sweeping our flocks and herds. The hepherds fled
Forfatety, and for uccour. I alone,
With bended bow, and quiver full of arrows,
Hover'dabout the enemy, and mark'd
The road he took, then hafted to my friends:
Whom, with a troop of fifty chosen men,
I net advancing. The pursuit I led,
Till we o'ertook the poil-encuiiier'd foe.
We fought and conquer'd. 'ErÂ» a sword was drawn,

An

An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,
Who wore that day the arms which now I wear.
Returning home in triumph, I difdain'd
The hepherd's slothful life; and having heard
That our good King had fumnon'd his bold peers
To lead their warriors to the Carron fide,
I left my father's house, and took with me
A chosen servant to condua my steps:
Yon trembling coward who forsook his master.
Journeying with this intent, I past these towers,
And, heaven-directed, came this day to do
The happy deed that gilds my humble name.

Lord Ran. He is as wife as brave. Was ever tale

With such a gallant modesty rehears'd ?
My brave deliverer! thou shalt enter now
A nobler lift, and in a monarch's fight
Contend with princes for the prize of fame.
I will present thee to our Scottilh King,
Whose valiant spirit ever valour lov'd.
Ha! my MATILDA ! wherefore arts that tear?

Lady Ran. I cannot Cay: for various affections,

And strangely mingled, in my bosom swell;
Yet each of them may well command a tear.
Ijoythat thou art safe ; and admire
Him and his fortunes who hath wrought thy safety.
Obscure and friendless, he the army fought,
Bent upon peril, in the range of death
Refolv'd to hunt for fame, and with his sword
To gain diftintion which his birth denied.
In this attempt unknown he might have perifh'd,
And gain'd, with all his valour, but oblivion.
Now grac'd by thee. his virtue serves no more
Beneath despair. The soldier now of hope
He stands conspicuous; fame and great renown
Are brought within the compass of his sword.
Onthis my mind reflected, whilll you spoke,
And blefs'd the wonder-working Lord of heaven.

Lord Ran. Pious and grateful ever are thy thou ghts !

My deeds hall follov where thou point'ft the way.
Next to myself, and equal to GL ENALVO N,
In honour and command hall NORVAL be.

NVrv.

# SCENE II.

ior.v. I know not how to thank you. Rude I am,

In peech and manners: never tillthis hour
Stood in luch a presence: yet my lord,
There's Ibinething in my breast which makes me bold
To fay, that NORVAL ne'er will fiane thy favour.

Lady Ran. I will be sworn thou wilt not. Thou

shalt be

My knight, and ever, as thou didft to day,
With happy valour guard the life of RA DOLP H.

Lord Ran. Well haft thou spoke. Letme forbid re-

ply (To NORVAL.

We are thy debtors fill; thy high desert
O'ertops our gratitude. I must proceed,
As was at firit intended, to the camp.
Some of my train I lee are speeding hither,
Impatient. doubtlels, of their lord's delay.
Go with me, NORVAL, and thine eyes fhallfee
The chosen warriors of thy native land,
Who languifn for the fight, and beat the air
With brandifh'd vords.

N.orv. Let us begone, my lord.
Lord Ran. [To Laly RANDOLPH] About the time

that the declining fun

Shall his broad orbit o'ervon hills suspend,
Expect us to return. This night once more
Within thete walls I relt ; my tent I pitch
To-morrow in the field. Prepare the feal.
Free is his eart who for his country fights:

Lady BA N D oL H

r and A :; A .
Lady Ran. His parting words have flruck a fatal

truth.

O DoCGLAS ! DOUGoLAs ! tender was the tin,
When we two parted, nr to mect again !

How many years of anguish and derpair
Has heav'n annex'd to those swift pafling hours
Of love and fondness ! Then my bosom's flame
Oft, as blown back by the rude breath of fear,
Return'd, and with redoubled ardour blaz'd.

Anna. May gracious heav'n pour the sweet balm of

peace

Into the wounds that fester in your breat !
For earthly consolation cannot cure them.

Lady Ran. One only cure can heav'n itfelfbeltow ;-

A grave-that bed in which the weary reft.
Wretch that am ! Alas ! why am I so?
At every happy parent I repine !
How blest the mother of yon gallant No Rv A L
She for a living husband bore her pains,
And heard hii bless her when a man was born:
She nurs'd her freiling infant on her breast :
'Tended the child, and rear'd the pleasing boy:
She, with affection's triumph, saw the youth
In grace and comeliness urpafs his peers:
\Whilit I to a dead hulband bore a son,
And to the roaring waters gave my child.

Anna. Alas ! alas! why will you thus refums

Your grief afrefl ? I thought that gallant youth
Would for a while have won you from your woe.
On him intent you gazed, with a look
Much more delighted, than your pensive eye
Has deign'd on other objeces to bellow.

Lady Ran. Delighted fay'ft thou ? Oh ! even there

mine eye

Pound fuel for nly life-confumling sorrow.
I thought, that had the Ion of DoU.G iAS liv'd,
-le might have been like this young gallant firanger.
And pair'd with himin Ieatures and in fliape,
In all endowments, as in years, I deem,
My boy with blooming No ItvAL m night have nunmbr'd.
Whilst thus I mus'd, a fp.rk from fancy ell
On my fad heart, and kindled up a fondneis
For tlis young llran er, wand'ring fron his home
And like an oplani call pon my care.
I will prote thee, '(fid I to inylelf)
With all ny power, and gace with all my favour.

C Anna.

Anna. Sure heav'n will bless so gen'rous a resolve.

You muff, my noble dame, exert your power:
You must awake : devices will be fram'd,
And arrows pointed at the breast of No RvAL.

Lady Ran. GLENALVON'S false and crafty head will

work

Againit a rival in his knfinan's love,
If I deter him not : I only can.
Bold as he is, GLE.ALVON will beware
Iow he pulls down the fabric that I raise.
I'll be the artist of young NORV.L'S fortune.
'Tis pleasing to admire : most apt was I
To this affection in my better days;
Though now I eeni to you hrunk up, retii'd
Within the narrow compals of my woe.
Have you not some times seen an early flower
Open its bud, and spread its silken leaves,
To catch sweet airs, and odours to bestow
Then, by the keen blall nipt, pull in its leaves,
And, tho' still living, die to scent and beauty
Emblem of me : affliction, like a form,
llath kill'd the forward blossom of my heart.

Enter GLENALVON.

Clen.W here is my dearest kinfilan, noble RA N ) o I.P H ?
Lady Ran. Have you not heard, GLENALVON of the

base-

G.'n. I have : and that the villains may not'fcape,

With a frong band I have begirt the wood:
If they lurk there, alive they liall be taken,
.And torture force fiom them th' important secret
Whether fom foe so oRAND LI' hir'd their swords,
Or if-

I.ady Ran. That care becomes a kinfinan's love.
I have a counsel for GLE NALVON's ear. (Exit AKNA.)

# SCENE III.

Yourself except, durst thusaccoft GLENALVON.

Lady Ran. Is guilt so bold? and dost thou make a

merit

Of thy pretended meekness ? This to me !
Who, with a gentleness which duty blames,
Have hitherto conceal'd what, if divulg'd,
Would mrnake thee nothing; or, what's worse than that,
An outcart beggar, and unpitied too:
For mortals hudder at a crime like thine.

Glen ''hy virtue awes me. Firit of womankind !

Permit me yet to ay, that the fond man
Whom love transports beyond ffrit virtue's bounds,
If he is brought by love to misery,
In fortune ruin'd, as in mind forlorn,
Unpitied cannot be. Pity's the alms
Which on such beggars freely is bestowed
For mortals know that love is still their lord,
And o'er their vain resolves advances still !
As fire, when kindled by our Shepherds, moves
''hro' the dry heath before the fanning wind.

Lady Ran. Reserve there accents for some other ear.

To love's apology I liften not.
Mark thou my words ! for it is meet thou hould'ft.
His brave deliverer RANDOLPH here retains,
Perhaps his presence may not please thee well:
But, at thy peril, praftife aught against him:
Let not thy jealousy attempt to hake
And loosen the good root he has in RA N D O LP ;
Whose favourites I know thou haft supplanted.
Thou look'll at me, as if thou fain would'll pry
Into ny henrt. 'Tis open as my speech.
I give this early caution, and put on

hlie curb, before thy temper breaks away.

Hi-i fiiend I am, and be not thou his foe. [Exit,

# ACT III. SCENE I.

I am not what I have been; what I hould be.
The darts of destiny have alnoft pierc'd
My marble heart. Had I one grain of faith
In holy legends, and religious tales,
J hould conclude there was an arm above
That fought against me, and malignant turn'd
To catch Inyfelf, the subtle snare I set.
Why, rape and murderare not simple means!
Th' imperfect rape to RANDOLPH gate a poulc;
And the intended murder introduc'd
A favourite to hide the fun from me;
And wortt of all, a rival. Burning hell!
This were thy center, ifI thought fle lov'd him !
'Tis certain he contemns me; nay commands mn,
And waves the flag of her difpleal'ure o'er me,
In his behalf. And hall I thus be brav'd ?
Curb'd, as fle calls it, by dame chastity ?
Infernal fiends, if any fiends there are
More fierce than love, ambition, and revenge,
Rile up and fill my bosom with your fires
And policy remorseless! Chance may spoil
A single aim ; but perseverance muRt
Prosper at last. For chance and fate are words:
Perfiftive wisdom is the fate of man.
Darkly a projea peers upon my mind,
Like the red moon when riling in the east,
.Crols'd and divided by ftrange-colour'd clouds.
I'll seek the slave who came with NORVAL hither,
And for his cowardice was spurned from him.

Pri. Then, thus adjur'd, I'll speak to you as just

As if you were the miniser of heaven,
Sent down to search the secret fins of men.

Some eighteen years ago, I rented land

Of brave Sir MA-LCOLM, then BALARMO'S lord;
But falling to decay, his servants ieiz'd
All that I had, and then urn'd me and mine,
(Four helpless infants and their weeping mother)
Out to the mercy of the winter winds.
A little hovel by the river's fide
Receiv'd us : there hard labour, and the Ikill
In ithiig, which was formerly my Iporr,
Supported life. Whillt thus we poorly liv'd,
One ftornly night, as I remember well,
'he wind and rain beat hard upon our roof:
Red came the River down, and loud and oft
''he angry spirit of the water hriek'd.
At the dead hour o night was heard the cry
Of uoe in jeopardy. 1 rote, and ran
To where the circling eddy of a pool
Beneath the ford, us'd oft to bring within
My reach whatever floating thing the tlieam
lad caught. The voice was ceas'd ; the person loft:
lit looking fad and earnest on the waters,
By the moon's light 1 saw, whirl'd round and round,
A bas:et: loon I drew it to the bank,
And nciled curious there n infant lay.

Lady Ran. Wias he alive ?
Pri. He was
Lady Ran. liihumian that thou art!
llow couldil thou kill what waves anid tenlpefis spat' ?

Pri. I am no; bo inhuman.
Lady Ran Did thou not ?
Anna. M1\ oble unilltes, you are mov'd too much

T.l- nman hisa not the afpct of Itern murder:
Let hiiim ;', , and you, I hope, will hear
Good tiuin ofyour kinlman's long lott child.

Pri. The needy muan, who has known better days,
One whom di'Lrels has spited at the world,

is

Is he whom tempting fiends would pitch upon'
To do it;chl deeds as iake the prosperous men
Lift up their hands and wonder who could do them.
And such a man was I ; a man declin d,
Who saw no end of black adversity:
Yet, for the wealth of kingdoms, I would not
Have touch'd that infant, with a hand of harm.

Lady Ran. Ha! dolt thou fayfo ? Then perhaps he

lives !

Pri. Not niany days ago he was alive.
LadyRan. O! God of heav'n! Did he then die so

lately?

Pri. I did not sav he died ; I hope he lives,

Not many days ago these eyes beheld
Him, flourilhing in youth, and health, and beauty.

Lady Ran. M here is he now ?
Pri Alas ! I know not where.
Lady Ran. Oh late ! I fear thee fill. Thou riddler,

fleak
Direct and clear ; elce I will search thy foul.

Anna. Permlit me, ever honour'd ! Keen impatience,

Tho' hard to be rellrain'd, defeats itself.-
Pursue thy tory with a faithful tongue,
To'the lalt hour that thou didit keep the child.

Pri. Fear not my faith, tho' I nmutl speak my h.ame:

Within the cradle, where the infant lay,
Was flow d a mighty store of gold and jewels;
'emnpted by which we did relolve to hide,
lroun all the world, this wonderful event,
And like a peasant breed the noiuie child.
That none might mark the change of our estate,
We lei t the country, travell'd to the north,
Uought tlocks and herds, and gradually biought for!li
Our Icclet wealth. But God's all-feeing eye
Bieheld our avarice, and linote us fore.
For one by one all our own children died.
And lie, the ftrangcr, lble remain'd the heir
Olfwhat indeed was his. Fain then would 1,
Who with a flther's fondness lov'd the boy,
Have trulled him, now in the dawn of youth,
With his own Ifecet: but my anxious ile,
Foreboding evil, never would conlsnt.

Mean

Mean while the tiripling grew inyears and-beauty;
And, as we oft oblerv'd, he bore hilnfelf,
Not as the offspring ol our cottage blood;
For nature will break out : mild with the mild,
But with the froward he was fierce as fire,
And night and day he talk'ldof war and arms.
I let mylelf againit his warlike bent;
But ail in vain: for whenadefperate band

Your own brave brother, fell, the good old lord

To overlook the conduct of his servants.

May heaven so judge me as I judg'd my mater !
And God so love mie as I love his race I

That like a holy hermitage appears
Among the clifts of Carron ?

Pri. I remember
The cottage of the clifts.

Lady Ran. 'Tis that I mean:

There dwells a man of venerable age,
Who in my father's service spent his youth:
Tell him I sent thee, and with him remain,
'Till I shall call upon thee to declare,
Before the king and nobles, what thou now
To me haft told. No more but this, and thou
Shalt livein honour all thy future days;
Thy son so long shall call thee father still,
And all the land hall bless the man, who siv'd
The son ofDouc.AS, and Sir VMALCOLM'S heir.
Rememlber well my words: if' thou flould'ft meet
HIinm whom thou call't thy son, flillcall him so;
And mention nothing of his nobler father.

Pri. Fear not that I Ihall mar To fhir an harvefi,

By putting in my fickle ere'tis ripe.

And make him wear there jewels on his arms

Lady Ran. My faithful ANNA ! dost thou share my

I know thou dost. Unparallel'd event !
Reaching from heaven to earrh, Jehova's arin
Snatch'd froin the waves, and brings ne to ny son!
fudge of the widow, and the orphan's father !
Accept a widow's and a mother's thanks
For luch a gift ! What does my AN NA think
Of the young eaglet of a valiant nelt ?
How oon he gaz'd on bright and burning arms,
Spurn'd the low dunghill where his fate had thrown him,
And tower'd up to the region of his fire.

Anna. How fondly did your eyes devour the boy !
Myllerious nature, with the unseen cord
Of powerful initinEt, drew you to your own.

Lady Rtn. The ready story of his birth believ'd

Supprell my fancy quite; nordid he owe
To any likeness ily bt sudden favour:
But now I long to fee his face again,
Exanine every feature, and find out
Thelineanients of DOUrLAS, or my own.
But noll of all, I long to let him know
WVho his true parents are, to clasp his neck,
And tell hinm all the ltory of his father.

/,lnn. With wvar caution you mull bear yourself

In public, left your tenderneis break forth,
And in oll'ervei stir conieetures llrange.
For, ifa cherub in the hape of womnan
Should walk this world, yet defamation would,
I.ikea vilecur, balk at he angel's train-
To-day the baron Itaricd at your tears.

Lady

Lody Ran. He did o ANNA ! well thy milfrefs

knows,

If the least circumfance, mote of offence,
Should touch the baron's eve, his fight would be
With jealousy diforder'd. But the more
It does behove me inltant to declare
The birth of Dou LAs, and assert his rights.
This night I purpose with my son to meet,
Reveal the secret and consult with him :
For wile he is, or my fond judgment errs.
As he does now, so look'd his noble Father,
Array'd in nature's eale : his icein, his speech,
Were l'eetly simple, and full oft deceiv'd
Those trivial mortals who feemn always wife.
But, when the matter m.itch'd his mighty mind,
Uprole the hero: on his piercing eye
Sat oblervation; on each glance of thought
Decision follow'd, as the thunder-bolt
Pursues the flash.

Anna. That demon haunts you still:
Behold GLEXALVU .

Lady Ran. Now I fbun liin not.

This dayI brav'd himt in behalf of NORVI. ;
Perhaps too far : at leall mily nicer fears
For DOUGLAS thus interpret.

Enter C L.N \LVU':.

Glen. Noble dame !

The hov'ring Dane at lafl his m:nn hath landed:
Nob.ndl of piraes ; but a mighty lbolt,
That conie to fettle where their v.al.ur conquers;
To win a country, or to lolf theml';lves

Lady Ran. But whence comes this intdligence, G i.:-
NAI.VON ?

Glen. A nimble courier sent from vyoldecr canp,

To haflen up the chieftains o' the north,
lnform'd me, as he pall, that the licrce Dine
H-ad on the eale:rn coall of Lothian landed,
Near to tat pl.ice whvere the ltea-rock iticinfc,
Animaingf hal's, loks o'er a fertile land.

Lady Ran. Then nullt tlhis welcrin armyn mnarch to

join
The warlike troops that guard Edena's tow'rs.

G.en.

Glen. Beyond all question. If impairing time

Has not effac'd the image of a place,
Once perfect in iriy breatt, there is a wild
Which lies to weltward ot that mighty rock,
And seems by nature formed for the camp
Of water-wafted armies, whose chief strength
Lies in firm foot, unflank'd with warlike horse:
If martial fcill direcs the Danish lords,
Therein acceflible their army lies
To our swift fcow'ring horle, the bloody field
Mult mian to man, and foot to foot, be fought.

Lady Ran. How many mothers Ihall bewail their

sons!

How many widows weep their husbands slain
Ye dames of Denmark ! ev'n for you I feel,
Who, sadly fitting on the sea beat ihore,
Lon;, look for lords that never hall return.

Glen. Oft has th' unconquer'd Caledonian sword

\idow'd the north. The children of the slain
Come as I hope, to meet their fathers' fate.
'The monster war, with her infernal brood,
Loud yelling fury, and life-ending pain,
Are objecs luited to GLENALVoN'S foul,
Scorn is more grievous than the pains of death;
Reproach more piercing than the pointed sword.

Lady Ran. I scorn thee not, but when I ought to

scorn;

Nor e'er reproach, but when insulted virtue
Againlt audacious vice lrerts herself.

own thy worth, G LENA . VON ; none more apt
'lhan I to prailb thine eminence in arms,
And be the echo of thy martial fame.
No longer vainly feed a guilty paflion:
(;o and pursue a lawful mistress, glory,
Lpon the Danith.crells redeem thy fault,
And let tliv valour be the ftiield of RANDOLPH.

(.', ,. One instant flay, and hear an alrer'd man,

W\hen beauty pleads for virtue, vice abalh'd
"'liec its own colours, and goes o'er to virtue.
I am your convert; tine will fliew how truly:
Yet one imeodiate proof I mean to give.
'Ih't.youth lor whom 'our ardent zeal to-day,

D Some-

Somewhat.too haughtily, defy'd your slave,
Amidst the shock of armies I'll defend,
And turn death from him, with a guardian arm.
Sedate by use, my boiom maddens not
A: the tumultuous uproar of the field.

LadyRan. Ad thus, GLENALVON, and I am thy

friend:

But that's thy least reward. Believe me, fir,
The truly generous is the tuly wife;
And he who loves not others, lives unblest.

Exit Lady RANDOLPn.

Glen. [solus] Amen! and viitue is its own reward!-

I think that I have hit the very tone
In which she loves to speak. Honey'd assent
How pleasing art thou to tle talte of man,
And woman also ? flattery diret
Rarely disgusts. They little know mankind
Who. doubt its operation: 'tis my key,
And opes the wicket of the human heart.
How tar I have succeeded now I know not.
Yet I incline to think her stormy virtue
Is lull'd a while : 'tis her alone I fear:
Whillt she and RANDOLPH live, and live in faith
And amity, uncertain is my tenure.
Fate o'er my head suspends disgrace and death,
By that weak hair, a peevilh female's will.
1 am not idle: but the ebbs and flows
Of fortune's tide cannot be calculated.
That flaveof NOi(VAL'S I have found mos apt:
I thew'd him gold, and he has pawn'd his Ibul
To fay and swear whatever I fuggelt.
NORVAL, I'm told, has that alluring look,
'Twixt man and woman, which I have obferv'd
To charm the nicer and fanta(tick dailes,
Who ate, like lady RANDOLPH, full of virtue.
In raising RANDOLPH'S jealousy I may
But point him to the truth. He feldomi errs
Who thinks the worst h can of womankind.

Of onie young knight refolv'd to break a spear,
And lain with hotile blood his maiden arms.

In vulgar breadts heroic ardor burns,
And the poor peafnnt mares his daring lord.

Lady Ran. Men's minds are temper'd like their

Lovers of danger on deflruction's brink
Theyjoy to rear eret their daring forms.
Hence, early graves ; hence the lone widow's life;
And the fad mother's grief-embitter'd age.
Where is our gallant guest ?

Lord Ran. Down in the vale

.I left him managing a fiery dfeed,
Whose flubbornnels had foil'd the strength and fill
Of every rider. But behold he comes,
In earnest con:versation with GLE ALVON.

Enter No v A L and GLEN A LV ON.

GLENALVON ! with the lark arise; go forth,
And lead my troops that lye in yonder vale:
Private I travel to the royal camp:
NORVAL, thou goeft with me, But fay, young man,
Where didft thou learn lb to difcourle of war,
And in such terms, as I o'erheard to-day?
War is no village science, nor its phrase
A language taught amongst the fllepherd swains.

Norv. Small is the kill my lord delights to praise

In him he favours.-Hear front whence it came.
Beneath a mountain's brow, the molt remote
And inaccellible by hepherds trod,
In a deep cave, dug by no mortal hand,
A hermit liv'd ; a melancholy man,
Who was the wonder of our wand'ring fwairls.
Auflere and lonely, cruel to himself,
Did they report him; the cold earth his bed,
Water his drink, his food the fliepherds alnis.
I went to fee him, and my heart was touch'd
With reverence and pity. Mild he spake,
And entering on discourse, such stories told
As made me oft revisit hi. fad cell,
For he had been a soldier in his youth;

And

And fought in famous battles, when the peers
Of Europe, by the bold GODFREDO led,
Against th' usurping infidel dililay'd
T'he crols of Chirit, and won the Holy Land.
Pleas'd with my admiration, and the fire
His speech Itruck from me, the old man would alai
His years away, and at his young encounters:
Then, having shew'd his wounds, he'd fit him down,
And all the live-long day discourse of war.
Tohelp.nmy ancy, in the finooth green turf
He cut the figures of the marlhall'd hofs ;
Defcrib'd the motions, and explain'd the use
Of the deep column, and the lengthen'd line,
The quare, the crescent, and the phalanx firm.
Fbr all that Saracen, or ChriRtian knew
Of war's belt art, was to this hermit known.

Lord Ran. Why did this soldier in a defart hide

Tho'se qualities, that shou'd have grac'd a camp ?

Nrv.. That too at lalt I learn'd. Unhappy man !

Returning homewards by Mefina's port,
Loaded with wealth and honours bravely won,
A rude and boilt'rous captain of the tea
Faflen'd a quarrel on him. Fierce they fought:
The stranger fell, and with his dying breath
Dtclar'd his name and lineage. Mighty God !
The soldier cried, my brother! Oh! my brother!

Lady Ran. His brother !
,'r. Yes; of the fame parents born;

His only brother. They exchang'd forgiveness:
And happy, in my mind, was he that died:
For many deaths has the survivor I'uffer'd.
In the wild dcfart on a rock he fits,
Or on Ibme nameless trea'm's untrodden banks,
And ruminates all day his dreadful fate.
At times, alas ! not in his perseEt mind !
Holds dialogues with his lov'd brother's Ghost;
And oft each night forfikes his ullen couch,
To make fad orisons for him he flew.
Lady Rnn. To what nlyiterious wo(s are mortal,

born!
In this dire tragedy were there no more

Unhappy persons ? did the parents live ?

Norv. No; they were dead: kind heav'n had clos'd

Before their son had hed his brother's blood.

Which oft decrees an undeserved doom !
Let fchoolmen tell us why.- From whence these

From im own fate, her portion has been sorrow.

Glen. Permit me now to make one flight essay.

Of all the trophies which vain mortals boast,
By wit, by valour, or by wifdorm won,
The sirs and fairest, in a young man's eye,
Is woman's captive heart. Successful love
With glorious fumes intoxicates the mind;
And the proud conqueror in triumph moves
Air-born, exalted above vulgar men.

Lord Ran. And what avails this maxim ?
Glen. Much, my lord!

Withdraw a little: I'll accoftyoungNoRv r.,
And with ironical derisive counsel
Explore his spirit. If.he is no more
Than humble NORVAL, by thy favour rais'd
Brave as he is, he'll shrink aftonifh'd from nme:
But if he be the favourite of the fair,
Lov'd by the firit of Caledonia's dames,
He'll turn upon me as the lion turns
Upon the hunter's `pear.

NAorv. The setting fun,

With yellow radiance lighten'd all the vale,
And as the warriors mov'd, each polih'd helm,
Corflet, or spear, glanc'd back his gilded beams.
The hill they climb'd, and halting at it's top,
Of more than mortal size, tow'ring, they feem'd,
An hott angelic, clad in burning arms.

Glen. Thou talk'ft it well; no leader of our host,
In founds more lofty, speaks of glorious war.

Aorv. If I shall e'er acquire a leader's name,

My speech will be less ardent. Novelty
Now prompts my tongue, and youthful admiration
Vents itself freely ; since no part is mine
Ofpraife, pertaining to the great in arms.

Glen. You wrong yourself, brave fir; your martial

deeds

Have rank'd you with the great : but mark me,NoRvAL;
Lord RAN DO LPH'S favour now exalts your youth
Above his veterans of famous service.
Let me, who know these soldiers, counsel you.
Give them all honour ; seem not to command;
EIie they will scarcely brook your late sprung power,
Which nor alliance props, nor birth adorns.

A',,v. Sir, I have been accuftom'd all my days,

To hear and speak the plain and finiple truth:
And tho' I ave been told, that there are men
Who borrow. friendship's tongue to speak their scorn,
Yetin fcl, language lan little Ikill'd.
Tlrhrefore I thank G r.EN A LVON for his council,
Altin' it f(un!ed harfily. Why remind
M.: ofi)y birth obscure ? Why slur my power
\'Vi:l Iluc contemptuous terms

GC ,. did not Inean
To < '.: your pride, which now I fee is great.

Aori. My pride !
GC!n. Suppress it as you wish to prorper.

Yonr p ide'sexceflive. Yet for RAND o LPH'S fake
I wil! .,ot leave vou to it's rani direction.
If thuiso u IW'ell, and frown at high-born nmen,
W'i;l Ii !hl-born Inep endure a fliepherd's Icorn ?

Aor'v. A nlephlird's corn !

E GCeN.

Glen. Yes; if you presume

To bend on soldiers these dil'dainful eyes,
As if you took the aleafure of their minds,
And liid in secret, you're no match for me;
What will become of you ?

Arorv. If this were told! [Aside.
Haft thou no fears for thy piefunptuous self!

Glen. I-Ia ! Dost thou threaten me ?
Norv. Didft thou not hear ?
Glen. Unwillingly I did ; a nobler foe
Had not been quet'ion'd thus. But such as thee-

Naor.v. Whom dolt thou think me ?
Glen. Norval.
Nortv. So I am-
And whoisNoRvxrAL in GLENALVON'S eyes ?

Glen. A pealart's Ion, a wandering beggar-boy;
At best no more, even if he speaks the truth.

VNor. False as thou art, dost thou fufpet my truth ?
Glen. Thy truth ! rhou'rt all a lye; and falie as hell
Is the vain-glorious tale thou told'f1 to RANDOLPH.

Aor.v. It I were chain'd, unarn'd, and bedrid old,

Perhaps I should revile : But as I am
I have no tongue to rail. Te humble N RVA1.
Is of a race, who lirive not but with deeds.
Did I not fear to freeze thy flhallow valour,
And make thee fink too soon beneath my word,
I'd tell thee-what thou art. I know thee well.

Glen. Doll thou not know C.ENALVON, born to

conilnland
Ten thoufandl fnaves like thee ?

nAtsr. V\illain, no more:

Draw nd :'!cend thy life. I did de'ign
'Io ; i' det'v'd thee in another cule:
IBut hieaven acceltrites it's vengennce on thee.

(Sheaths his sword.)

Lord Ran. Speak not thus,

Taunting each other ; but unfold to me
The cau;e ofquarrel, then Ijudge betwixt you.

A'rv. Nay my good lord, tho' I revere you much,

My cause I plead nor, nor demland your judgment.
I blush to peak ; I will not, cannot speak
Th' opprobrious words that I from him have borne.
To the liege lord of my dear native land
I owea fubjeÃ³t's homage: but ev'n hin
And his high arbitration I'd rejea.
Within my borom reigns nother lord:
Honour, folejudge and umpire of itself.
If my free speech offend you, noble RAN DOtP Â«,
Revoke your favours, andlet NORVAL go
hIence as he came, alone, but not dilhonour'd.

Lord Ran. Thus far I'll mediate with ipartial

voice:

The antient foe of Caledonia's land
Now waves his banners o'er her frighted fields.
Suspend your purpole, 'till your country's arin
Repel the bold invader: then decide
The private quarrel.

Glen. I agree to this.

Down on the deep: then lifting up her head
And her white hands to heaven, seeming to fay,
Why am I forc'd to this ? She plung'd herself
Into the empty air.

Lord Ran. I will not vent,

In vain complaints, the passion of my foul.
Peace in this world I never can enjoy.
These wounds the gratitude of RAND oLP H gave.
They speak aloud, and with the voice of fate
Denounce mydoem. I am refolv'd. I'll go
Straight to the battle, where the man that makes
Same turn aside must threaten worse than death.
Thou, faithful to thy miflrefs, take this ring,
Bull warrant of my power. Let every rite
With coil and pomp upon their funerals wait:
'or RANDOLP hopes he never hall return.

Spoken by Mr. B A R R Y.

VsN Epilogue 1 alk'd; but not one word

./. Our bard 'will write. He voow s 'ti moJl absurd
Iith comic wit to contradidt the firain
Of tragedy, and make yourforrows vain.
Sadly hefays, that pity is the befI,
The nobles pafflon of the human breaf :
For uwhen its sacred lreams the heart o'er-flow,
Inguhes pleasure with the tide of woe;
Ind uwhen its wuaves retire, like those of Nile,
They leave behind them such a golden foil,
That there the virtues without culture grow,
There thef weet 1'loffoms of affedion blow.
These were his uwotrs ;-void of delusive art
Ifel them ; for he/poke them fronm is heart.
A'or xii/l I now attempt, with witty folly,
To cbace uway celellial melancholy.
