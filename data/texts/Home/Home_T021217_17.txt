# PREFACE.

PR EFACE.

T H E success of a Dramatic piece oi
the Stage, depends, fays Voltaire, upon
accidental circumstances, but the day of
publication decides its fate.

Persuaded of the truth of this remark,

the Author of the Tragedy of Alfred would
have submitted his performance, to the final
judgment of the Reader, without preface or
apology, if he had not been advised, and
indeed urged, to make a reply to some
hostile critifcims, which appear to have been
founded upon prejudice and opinion, ra-
ther than reason and argument.

It

( vi )

It has been alledged, that the character 6o

Alfred, in the Tragedy, does not agree
with the character of Alfred in History:
' That the Hero, the Legislator, is degraded
to a Lover, who enters the Danish camps
from a private, not a public, motive, and
acs the part of an impostor."

In Tragedy, if the subjed be Hiftoricalo

an author is not permitted to introduce
events, contrary to the great eftablifled fads
of Hiflory; for instance, in the Tragedy of
Alfred, the Hero must not be killed, nor
driven out of England by the Danes; but
preserving those ancient foundations, as the
.piers of his bridge, the Author may bend
his arches, and finifli the fabrick, accord-
ing to his taste and fancy, for the poet is at
liberty, and it is the essence of his art, to
invent such intermediate circumstances,
and incidents, as he thinks will produce the
most affecting situations. In this department,

the

( vii )

the Poet's fancy is controuled by nothing,
but probability and consistence of character,
the barriers of dramatic truth. Let us apply
this principle to the point in dispute.

Alfred was a young man, when he fought

the battle of Ethendune. The victory, which
gave him poffefion of the kingdom, mulf
have been gained before he begun to model
the state. Is it improbable to fuppoie, that
a young hero was in love ? Is it inconfift-
ent to represent the person, who was a Le-
giflator, when advanced in years, as a lover
in his youth ! Does it degrade the charater
of a hero to suppose, that he was in love
with the princess, whom he afterwards
married ? Is it not rather injurious to his
heroism to conclude, that he chore a consort
whom he did not love? If this reason-
ing is just, there will be no difficulty in
vindicating the subsequent conduct of the
hero. The dramatic and the real Alfred,

are

( viii

are both involved in the charge of impof..
ture; both enter the Danifi camp in dif.
guise; the previous events, as narrated in
the tragedy, are nearly the fame with thofC
mentioned in history. Alfred, for al.
most two years, had wandered thro' Eng-
land, concealing himself under feigned
names and charaders. He lived in the
midit of his enemies, by being supposed to
be dead. Emerging from this obscurity, he
appears in the tragedy, and is informed of
the alarming, ambigous situation of Ethelf-
wida; his usual stratagems present them-
selves, one would think, naturally to his
mind, extremely agitated, and prone both by
temper and habit, to the most daring and
romantic enterprizes. He resolves to enter
the Daniih camp, to learn the fate of
Ethelfwida, and observe the strength and
order of the enemy's army, before he ven.
tures a decisive engagement.

The

(ix )

The continued artifice is inevitable.

The conduct of Alfred, in the camp of
Hinguar; the manner in which he de*
ceives the Dane, is extremely similar to the
condu& of Orestes in the Eledra of So-
phocles, which no critic hitherto has
blamed. Orestes enters the palace of AEgis-
thus, as the messenger of his own death,
carrying an urn, which contains (he fays)
the ashes of Orestes, whose untimely fate he
most circumstantially relates. The Grecian
hero pra(fifes the deceit with an intention
to kill the persons whom he deceives. The
English hero deceives Hinguar only to gain
access to Ethelfwida, without meaningto hurt
the person of his enemy. To praise Sophocles,
and blame the author of Alfred, for the fame
conduc, seems a direc contradiction, which
can only be accounted for, in one way; an
imaginary idea has been formed of the cha-
racter of Alfred as an old mortified, ascetic
sage, of spirit too sublime and etherial

b to

(x )5

to descend to human passions or humaa
actions. But the real as well as the dramatic

Alfred was a young hero, a bard, a winner
of battles, brave and magnanimous, but
compelled by the pressure of those desperate
times, in which he lived, to praftiie a
ihoufand arts, to exist by simulation and
diliimulation. Whoever recollects and

weighs these circumstances, will it is pre-
fumed readily pardon the artifice of Alfred,
in the Tragedy, and acknowledge that the
feigned incidents of the piece are altogether
consistent with the true. If not, the author
must be contented to labour under the im-
putation of an erroneous judgment, for he
meant nothing less than to degrade the
charader of Alfred; on the contrary, find-
ing in the records of a remote and barbarous
age, a hero of great renown, but from the
defec of his historians, involved in clouds
and darkness:

Qjzi caput inter nubila condit,

he

( x )

'he was tempted to seize his name, and
display his character in new situations con-
neced with the old and well known events

of his life and fortune. The play is printed as
it was performed. An alteration has been
made, in one scene, and sent to the Theatre,
which, if the Tragedy lhould be resumed
or revived, may perhaps contribute to
heighten its effet,

The secret junto of the realm of wit;
In there hard times, resolved their flock to spar4,
And crib the Prologue from the bill of fare.
Alfred on Englih ground alone may stand,

And you in Prologue lhould protec your bard
When my adventurous muse, indulg'd before;
Now vent'ring further, needs indulgence more;
She dares to trace the workings of a mind,
The greatest and the best of human kind;
Adjust its movements to dramatic plan,
And blend the god-like hero with the man.

Such weight theflying courser never bore.
Alfred ! whose life uchflrange events adorn,
Shat history beholds romance with scorn;
Him to present, here in his native land,
Where flill his genius, and his laws command,
Is an attempt like his, who rashly tried,
The burning chariot of the fun toguide!
Yet this attempt from admiration rose,
NorJhould hefind in Alfred's kingdom, foes:
He, who by temper led, not love of fame,
Is the fond eccho of your hero's name.

By Mr, G A R R C K.

U R bards of late, so tragic in tikes :, '"'

,

Havefcarce preferv'd one heroine from falnig ;
Whether the dame be widow, maid, or wife,
She seldom from their hands escapes with life:
If this green cloth couldfpeak, would it not tell,
Upon it's well-worn nap how oft Ifell?
To death in various forms deliver'd up,
Steel kills me one night, and the next the Cup:
The tragic process is asJhort, as certain;
With* THIS,-or t THIS, I drop-thendrops thecurtain
Nojaint can lead a better iife then I,
For half isfpent inJtudy'ng how to die:

Mild criticks wi/hgood fortune to the good;
While others hot-brain'd, roar for blood! blood! blood!-
Thefair, tho' nervous, tragic to.the foul,
Delights in daggers, and the poifon'd bowl:
" I would not give a black-pin for a Play,
"' Unless in tenderners I melt away:
"' From pangs, and death no lovers would I save, '
"They should be wretched, and despair and rave;
"And ne'er together lie-but in the grave " J
Ihe brave rough soldier, a soft heart discovers
Hefwears and weeps at once, when dead the lovers':
As down his cheeks run t} ickling nature's tide,
" Damn it-I with those young ones had not dy'd :"
Tho'froJm his eyes the drop of pity falls,
Hefights like Calfar, wheen his country calls:
Injpite of critic laws, our bard takespart,
Andjoins in concert with thefoldiet's heart:
0 let yourfeelings with thisparyfide,
For once forgive me that I have not ay'd;
Too hard that fte, which kills a virgin bride!

She makes the motion of itabbin'.

With cafe deceived the unfufpeting soldier:

'My Lord of Devonshire, on me depend.

Steel shall not tear the secret from my breast;
Aftonifi'd as I am, at such a secret;
Who can unfold the cause ? Why, at this hour,
When, big with England's fate, each moment rolls,
Does Alfred hide himself, in clouds and darkness ?
And spread ficertain rumours of his state?
Confounding a!l belief.

DEVONSHIRE.

He spread them not.

From his uncertain fate, those rumours rose.
Ere ince that:time, when the perfidious Dane
Attack'd the English, in the hour of peace;
On Alfred's wedding day.

It was believed,

That Alfred, in rle general carnage, fell,
At Cyppenham; that, in the swelling flood'
Of wintry Avon, Ethelfwida perifh'd.

Such was the firil report.

Fain would I hear

Th'eventful tale of much-enduring Alfred;
iAnd what is yet of Ethelfwida known.

When faithless Hinguar, with his host, advanc'd,

The King, diftra6ted tcr his lovely bride, -
Sent off a hundred knights, by Surrey led,
To guard the Princess to a place of safety:

Then, furious, fac'd the Dane;-with odds opprefl,
Around their King, his faithful nobles fell.
Alfred, by favour of the night, efcap'd,
And wander'd long, obscure, from place to place,
Thro' woods and torefts, like ftme beast of prey,
By cruel hunters chac'd. Much he endur'd;
And much his people fuffer'd. English virtue,
Like England's oak, grew firmer from the form.
Often the peasant his last morsel brought
To the dark wood or cave, where Alfred lay;
If quefiion'd by the Dane, denied the deed;
And died, undaunted, to preserve his prince.

O F F ICER.

The flory thrills my blood; by heaven and earth-
Where did he reft at last ?

DEVONSHIRE.

He never refted;

Even when he had a place of refuge found;
Where the deep winding streams, Parret and Thone
Their waters mix, a little illand lies,
With alders overgrown. No name it had,
Tho' now the name of Athblney it bears.
Marshes and pools, by inundation form'd,
Perplex the dire approach. There Alfred six'd
His dreary habitation. Two brave knights
At sirss were all his train. Day after day
Tle numbers grew; and many a gallant knight,
Found out the wild af)lum of his Lord.
From thence, with inroads fierce, they gall'd the Dane.
Dark as the spirits of the night they came,
And vaniflhd at the dawn. In that retreat,
The fun, thro' every sign, o'er Alfred roll'd

For certain, then, she lives. If the had perifh'dj
Her fate would have been known.

DEVONSHIRE.

The Danes afcrib'd

To me the inroads made by daring Alfred;
And both the Danifl princes took the field.
Hinguar, with fire and sword laid waste the land.
Hubba, his host to Kenwith castle led,
And, with strong fegc, begirt my ancient towers.
Then Alfred lufued from his lonelyifle,
Conceal'd, as now, bereath another name.

He six'd the fortune of that doubtful day.

When Hubba with his life the REAFEN 10Rt,
Th' inchanted standard, on whose magic wings
Conquer, till then, had flown. The battle won,
AlfreJ, impatient, bent his rapid course
To Weftmrorland; where, as he fondly'hop'd
His Ethelfwida dwelt. He found her not;
And, late last night,, in deep despair, rcturn'd.

My fneep is haunted with my waking thoughts !

The vision of the night is Ethelfwida.
Sorretimes, a broken scene of other woes
My troubled fancy to her image joins,
And adds the monarch's to the lover's grief.
This very night, in dreams, I thought myself
Under the friendly roof, where once 1 lay,
Beset, on every fide, with Danish spears;
When, to preserve my life, a noble youth,
The only offipring of a widow'd dame,
Unknown to me, my personage aftum'd,

Are signals of distress!

Of Ethelfwida's fortune; how it chanced,
That Surrey lives to tell it.

ALFRED.

0, my friend!

Forget my words. With deffiny at odds,
And with myself, impatience glanc'd at thee,
The martyr of my cause.

SURREY.

That fatal night,

When, with my precious charge, I left my Lords
Thro' many dangers happily we pass'd;
But when we reached fair Eden's distant vale,
We found no refuge there.

ALFRED.

Too well I know,

The Scots had raz'd Pendragon's lofty tower
Then, whither didft thou fly ?

SURREY.

There I difmifs'd

Most of my faithful knights. A few I kept,
Of cholen men the choice. Eastward we fleer'd,

C ' Towards

Towards the wilds, beyond the source of Tine.
By midnight marches, in untrodden paths,
That wind o'er mountains vast, thro' valleys deep;
We reach'd a lonely mansion, in a dale,
Which at the foot of fnow-clad Cheviot lies.
There Ethelfwida found a safe retreat;
And in those deserts wild, she might have dwelt,
Unheard of and unknown.

ALFRED.

Why did she not?

SURREY.

The rumour of thy death a tempest rais'd,

\Which, from that harbour, drove her out to sea,
On me fne laid her absolute commands,
To guide and guard her, as 1 could, to Kenwith:
My friends I warn'd to meet us on our way,
And on we went, till one unhappy time,
The Danes furpriz'd us in a narrow vaie.
Against their fierce attack, our little band,
Around the Princess, form'd a fence of steel.
More and more narrow still the circle grew,
Till Ialone'was left with Ethelfwida.
A!one I foughr, till at her feet I fell.
Her difinal fhric-ks, her piercing cries I heard;
More grievous far, than all the wounds I bore.

ALFRED.

Methinks I hear her cries: She call'd on Alfred;

Did Lfe not, Surrey ? Providence divine !
Why was not Alfred near?

SURREY.

As I have heard,

From some who in the troops of Hinguar fought,
For he it was who led the hostile band,

She

She fwoon'd with grief and terror on the spot.
The Dane to her unwonted pity ihow'd,
And rais'd her from the ground.

ALFRED.

Tell me the truth;
Do not deceive me, Surrey.

SURREY.

0, my Lord,

I never did, nor will I now deceive thee !
But of the Princess this I only know,.
That in the Danilh camp, she till remains,
Guarded with care, her name and rank unknown;

ALFRED.

What should I think ! Can she submit to live-

To live, her honour loft ? How didft thou 'scape
From such a slaughter ? And how cam't thou hither,
Commiffion'd by the Dane ?

SURREY.

When night came on,

Some English peasants, who had teen the fight,
Crept from their huts, in secret, to the field,
With pious purpose to inter the dead.
In me alone, some sparks of life they found.
Their care preferv'd me. When my strength return'd,
To Hinguar's camp I went, gave out mnyfelf
Of Danith race, altho' in England born.
My service was accepted. I have found
Favour in Hinguar's fight; and, in the band
That guards his person, serve. From them I learn'd,
That Ethelfwida, near his tent, is lodg'd
A mournful captive,

C 2 ALFRED.

ALFRED.
Near his tent ! O heaven!
How have I merited ?

DEVON SHIRE.

Raise not thine eyes,

Nor l1;t thy hands to heaven: Far other looks,
Far ether acions, heaven of thee requires.
Thcu art a !irng, a lul:ir, and a lover;
Fight for thy crown, thy country, and thy bride.

Enflav'd by force, 'tis force must set her free.
He cannot treat with Hinguar that he knows,
By fad experience; for the woes of Alfred,
And all the evils of this hapless land,
Arose from England's confidence in Denmark.
No ties divine or human, bind the Danes.

And most profane is Hinguar,

DEVONSHIRE.

I heard the parting words of faithful Surrey,
Which mark too well, the colour of thy purpole.

ALFRED.

Thy approbation I do not expet.

None can approve, but thole who feel like me.
The Danish camp, difguis'd, I will explore,
Clad in the vesture of a British Bard,.
And learn, for certain, Ethelfwida's'fate,
Whatever has befallen my hapless bride;
Affur'd of that, my heart shall lhake no more.

DEVON S HIRE.
Something like this my anxious foul foretold.

ALFRED,

ALFRED.

I read thy thoughts, but urge me not to hear

Thy friendly counmels, which I cannot follow.
In great events, the agitated mind
Consults its enius only. Low or high
The active spirits in that level flow,
Nor fall nor rile, to a& another's counsel,
That potent counsellor direcs me now,
I feel the impulse, off in perils felt:
ior is my arm confin'd to Ethelfwida;
The strength and order of the Danish host,
How, and what quarter, I may best attack,
Attentive I'll obfcrve.

DEVONSHIRE.

Since thou haft six'd

Thy resolution, to contend is vain;
The part of friendlhip now is to consult,
How we may guard thee best.

ALFRED.

By the moon's light,

As, with a fv fr career, their camp I pals'd,
A wood, extended on the right I law,
(Their kfc the village Ethendune defends.)
Canst thou inform, if they have opened paths,
Or piantcd -atches there ?

DEVONSHIRE.

Neither, my Lord!
Prefimptuous Hinguar holds such caution vain.

ALFRED.

When duiky eve descends, in the dark time

Between the fail of night, and the moon's rife,.
In silence, thither march a thousand men,
Cholen i;th care, the bravest of our host;

There

There let them watch till morn, if no alarm
Comes ere the dawn, at dawn they may retire.

DEVONSHIRE.

To choose and lead that band fiall be my care:

My warriours are the Hunters of the Hill;
Accuftom'd to the woods, fearless they move,
By the pale glimpses of the clouded moon !
To them the changeful afpeas of the night,
Whose false presentments armies oft confound,
In all their forms are known.

ALFRED.

I wou'd not wifl
A. better leader, nor a braver band.

The word.

ALFRED.
St. George.
DEVONSHIRE.

0, may he guard the Kingt

And, as the minds of yonder heathen host,
In darkness lie; so may their eyes be dark
And blind to Alfred !

ALFRED.
As they still have been,

This is no new, tho' seeming bold attempt.
I have effay'd it, for'a flighter cause,
When, in the Isle of Athlney, I lay,
The quarters of the Dane I oft explor'd,
In this difguite, and-mark'd detruation's line.
Farewell, thy wildom no direftion neds;
Nor shall I long be absent from my friend. [Exunt.

To bear to thee the tidings of his death;
And as a proof, which could not be deny'd,
That ring I took, which erst mine eyes beheld,
Upon his finger plac'd, with rites and charms)
When he was crown'd, in London, -England's King.

Thou art no Saxon, but of Britilh race,
And lov'ft the mountains of thy native land;
Choose where they fairest rife they shall be thine,
With all their valleys and their Sylvan fireams.
The Gods I serve have sent thee to my aid.
'Tis my belief thou can'st assist me much,
In what is dearer to my foul than empire.

ALFRED.
How can the bard assist a Prince like thee ?

H ING U A R;

In high retpe&, I hold thy art divine.

Whate'er thou art, magician, bard or seer,
Or if thou art all there, I crave thine aid.
Amidst my victories, I am most wretched;
By love tormented, unsuccessful love.

Thy love, with equal love, is not return'd ?

HINGU AR.

Cannot ditringuilh nor reward my love.
If thou her cruel malady can'st charm,
And drive wild frenzy from her troubled mind,
Talk to fulfil thy wish the power of Hinguar.

ALFRED.

In me behold the man of thy desire.

Unlawful arts I neither use, nor know;
-But am, in nature's secrets, deeply fkill'd.
Far from the pteafures and tle cares of men,
By strange misfortune, to the defart driven,
A lonely anchoret, for years, I lived.
To me are known the virtues of each plant,
That grows in hill-or dale, in fun or shade;
How one, byfympathy, with madness raints;
And how another clears th' infected blood.
Much I can help or harm.

HINGUAR.

And plant andherb, or song and spell employ.
Do what thou wiltt, so thou reftor'ft the fair.

From sudden perturbation.of the mind ?
Or is the cause unknown?

From terror to excess, her frenzy rose.

In her person, nothing;

But agony of mind, to an excess,
Nor easy to describe.

Her name, her family ?

She calls herself; and when with questions urg'd,
She makes extravagant, fantastic answers,
And seems unconscious of her true condition.

Her general temper, is it fad or gay.?
For frenzy is most various.

HI N G U A R.

So is hers;

For she exhibits every various mood,
That frenzy e'er affum'd. But thou shalt fee,
And judge her strange demeanor. In yon tent,
With purple bright, she dwells; and to this spot,
Where now we stand, she frequently repairs.
This is her usual hour. Behold ! he comes.

The part I act, I hardly can sustain.
Didft thou not mark, when first I heard thy voieel

She started into well-diffembled frenzy.

Till now, I durst not,

Because I had no proof of my suspicion;
For in thy pretence, with amazing art,
She counterfeits diftra&ion. Well I knew
Thy partial love would ill receive a charge
On mere conjeture founded. What I saw
This day to certainty has chang'd my doubts.

My pris'ner; lay, what wou'dft thou now expect
Should be thy doom ?

ALFRED.

'Tis Hinguar's part to fay,
And mine to susser.

HIN G U AR.

Thou ihalt susser nothing,

Unnworthy of a king. Tho' of the race
Of war and battle, who have ftrerch'd the spear
Of conquest o'er mankind; yet I will speak
The words of peace. The English and the Danes
Have fought too long, for this contested land,
Whose spacious kingdoms can, with ease, contain
The rival nations; and the fertile fields
Glut, with luxurious plenty, their desires.
Let us divide the land, and join in league
Eternal: Then, united, shake the world.

ALFRED.

Treaties of peace and leagues have oft been made;
But how oblerved, thouknow'ft.'

H I N G U A R.

There was no bond

To make the former treaties fast and sure.
The peace I offer now lhall be confirm'd,
By ties, which bind the nations to each other.

G 2 My

My valiant brother left an ortly child,
In Denmark born, but here in England bred;
Matchless in form and feature is the maid;
Straight as the pine, that grows on Norway's hills.
She rifes tall above the virgin-train:
Blue rowls her melting eye: Her heaving breafi
Is whiter than the snow, that's newly fallen.
This maid of beauty I will give to Alfred,
The pledge and bond of union and of peace.

(ALFRED remain sfilent.

Why dost thou not reply ? Dost thou disdain
A bride of Danish race ?

ALFRED.

Silent, I fiand

To learn the full extent of thy design.
Mean'ss thou not still to blend the nations more;
To mix the roya! blood of either land;
And wed thyfdif a wife of Englilh race ?

HIN GU AR.
I do.

ALS R E D.
And 'tis my bride that thou hafc ehoien;

HINGUAR.

Call her not thine. Nothing belongs to thee.
A captive has no right.

And treat'ft rmelike a king I

HI N G U AR.

I'll make thee one,

Which now thou art not. Wed the maid of Denmark
And o'er thy father's ancient kingdom reign.

Unworthy I Ihould be to reign,-to live,

If I could make such barter ot my honour.
Is this the peace of Hinguar ?

HINGUAR: .

Yes : no other.

ALFRED.

HINGUAR.
They are.

So, with impunity, thou may'st insult me.

H I N G U A R.

I fland aftonifh'd at thy pride, thy folly.

Thou ruin'd Alfred, think of thy condition.
Thy life or death upon my nod depends.

ALFRED.

Ruin'd I am; but it was human weakness,

And no disgraceful fault, that ruin'd Alfred.
Impell'd by tender, anxious, jealous love;
Despising Danger, to thy tents I came;
And dofft thou think I am bo quickly alter'd ?
Dost thou imagine, that the dread of death
Can move my. loul to yield to thee my bride ?

And

And lead, if fle would follow me, to ihame ?
Hinguar, the meanest man of Saxon race,
In freedom born, would from such baseness shrink;
And scorn, with infamy, to purchase life.

HINGUAR.

Thou talk't it well; and I have often heard

Of the persuasive eloquence of Alfred.
Plain are m' words: They speak thy certain doom.
If not the friend and firm ally of Hinguar;
Thou dy'ft.

ALFRED.

My death will not conclude the war.

One ccurfe there is, if greatly thou afpir'li
To reign supreme in England, and possess
YWith honour gain'd, fair Ethelfwida's charms.

HINGUAR.
X do.

ALFRED:

Then mark me, Dane! Tho' thou art fprun-.

From heroes, more than human,-Odin's race,
Who ftretch'd the spear of conquest o'er the world;
And thou, thyself, in war and battles bred,
Chain'd to thy sword submissive fortune lead'ft;
Alfred, whole fathers have in battle fallen,
Whoe valour ne'er could fix inconftantfortune,
Offers to mneet thee, in the lifted field;
And, by his single arm, to thine oppos'd,
Decide the iovereigntyof England's realm,
By the award of heaven. In this encounter,
My nobles and'i y people will abide;
And, if thou conquer'ft, Ethelfwida's thine.

What folly to presume, thou fallen Alfred !

That I will free my captive, and contend
yiSrh him on equal terms!

A LS RED.

Brav'd as I was,

I thought it fitting, thus, to meet thy scorn.
Perhaps I entertain'd a glimpse of hope,
That thou might choose thus nobly to prevail,
To gain by valour warlike England's crown;
And to the beauteous Ethelfwida come,
The vi&or, not the murderer, of her huiband.

H ING-UAR.

The beauteous Ethelfwida has consented

To give her hand. The terms which thou difdain'ft
Vain-glorious Saxon ! are more ample far,
Than those which she did stipulate for thee.
Thus ihe rewards the constancy of Alfred.
Confider that,

ALFRED.

No, not one moment, Dane.

HINGUAR.

I will take no advantage of thy passion.

That Hinguar, instantly, shou'd set thee free.
When certain of thy safety, Alfred, then,
I was prepar'd and arm'd to mock the Dane-
To die.

Forgive the wrong I offered to thy virtue.

To ope the floodgates of my burfing heart.

To the imagin'd object of my wrath.

Nobly thy deeds may prove. Deliver Alfred
The vi&im of his love and of his virtue.
Long is the tale, too long to tell it now.
But Hinguar's voice has doom'd my Lord to death,
Because to him he wou'd not yield his bride.
If then the cause of that decree offend thee,
Treat with the King of England, and prevent it.

Make trial; prove their hearts; if they ihould faint,

Ruin abides them. They have gone too far,
Wirh safety, to recede. If he who draws
His iword against a King, away should throw
The useless scabbard, what ought he to do,
Who draws his word againit a fell usurper,
Who dares not show the mercy of a Prince A

RONEX.

That argument comes near. I'll urge it home;

The King of England is our only refuge.

Make him thy friend; and he will quickly turn,

Oppos'd to him we stand, equal in arms.

But

But from their hill the Englilh hoff descend,
To turn the scale of combat. Dost thou with
The tyrant to prevail ?

ALFRED.

Answer direc

Thy question needs not. Hinguar is my foe.
Grant me thole equal terms, I ask'd at first;
And to your arms I join the force of England.

RON E X.

Thy terms are more agreeable to Ronex,

Than those the policy of Denmark nam'd.
By Frea, eldest goddess of the sky,
The ancient arbiter of human things,
I Iwear to the performance.

ALFRED.

In that tent,
If Ethelfwida refts, I wi(h to fee her.

The Princess to a safer place is mov'd,
Near my pavilion.

He rivetted on mine his jealous eyes.
There is no proof, and 1 will brave the suspicion,
With loud appeals, with vows and protestations
Of purest innocence.--That shout is near;
It comes against the wind :-My foes prevail.

But flow thy hand. Come on. Odin for Denmark!

For England and her King, the living God!

Now, where is Hinguar's pride ?

H I N G U A R.

Here, in his heart,

Unconquer'd frill the pride of Hinguar dwells.
To die in battle is a warrior's death.
The hero fights and falls; but never yields.
Hinguar has fought. From sea to lea, his sword,
Thro' England blaz'd, a meteor dropping blood.
The wolf and eagle followed to the seass,
Tracking its course. The;warrior, old in arms,

And laid in duff the troubler of the land.

In dust thy hopes are laid. Behtld that robe.

With bloody gashes torn ! More fell than bears
That starve on hill of snow, how durfs thou lift

No. Ethelfwida fell

By Ronex. Yet, altho'l killed her not,
Her death delights me. Saxon, I rejoice
At thy calamity. Happy my lot,
Compar'dwith thine. To the Valkyrian maids
I go, to Odin and the hall of joy.
Thou of thy Love bereft, shalt wafle thy days,
In iamentation, like the wretch who pines
By Hca'- hake and drinks the poifon'd stream,
Pour'd:from the jaws of snakes. I laugh at t{ee,
And, like my fathers, die. (dts..

ETHELSWIDA.
Eternal powers! Is this the scene of joy ?

(After a pause, looking at the robe.

I am the cause accurst of Alfred's death,
And England's ruin. Bear me witness, heaven!-
But words are vain. Let those bewail their doom,
Who live to susser, and prolong their pain.
The gleam of hope, extinguih'd by despair,
Sharpens my sense of misery, and spreads
A deeper horror on my tortur'd mind.
My sure, and now my only friend, come forth.

The shades of death

Still swim before my eyes. I heard the ghost

Deep on my heart engrav'ct was the resolve,
Not to survive thee in the storms of fortune.
