'OF THE
TRAGEDY OF AC1i'S.

WITH
OBSERVATIONS on the Play, the

Performance, and the Reception.

Tenet auratum Limen Erynnis.
A G I S, a good king, rules in Sparta, a former

sovereign has been deposed for his vices: he
is living; and his queen remains in the
place.

Amphares, a turbulent and imperious magifirate,
plots with her for the restoration of her lord.

Lysander is a friend of Agis: he is- an Athenian.
youth; he fights his battles; and is vicorious.

A a Eu antl

[ 4

Euanthe, an.Athenian virgin, in love with Lysander,
has followed him to Sparta.

These are the principal persons.

Agis is acted justly by Mr. Moffop; Lysander glo-

rioufly by Mr. Garrick:. there is all the delicacy of
the sex in the manner of Mrs. Cibber's playing Euan-
the. -

Mr. Havard, one of the best men in the world, la-
bours to appear sufficiently the-villain.

Mrs. Yates performs the queen of the depofed-king:

the part is of importance in the story, but not much
in the person.

Mrs. Pritchard is the mother of the king. Mr.

Holland plays a Thracian, Rbefus, who has served in
the Spartan armies from a youth; and his brother
Euxus commands a body of Thracians brought in to
answer the purposes of the conspirator.

The play breathes heroism and virtue.

Amphares heightens the distress and trouble of the

action, by his love 'for Euanthe. His first objet is
the deftrudion of Agis; the next of Lysander; for a
double cause, because he is the support of Agis, and
he is his rival.

Lysander wins a battle, but leaves his troops with-

out the city. The commotions of the people threaten
Agis; who directs him to go to them, to be ready on
occasion. Love, and obedience to his miltrefs keep
him in the city in disguise; mean time the gates are
shut. There is an army of Thracian mercenaries in
the place; and he cannot get out. While he is speak-
ing with Euanthe, in disguise, Amphares enters, and
seizes the lady. Lysander goes out for a sword; and

returning

[ 5\

returning attacks the ravifler. The Thracians sup-
port Ainphares; but they will not kill Lysander.
Amphares holds his sword to Euanthe's breast, and
gives' the lover the alternative to yield, or fee her die.
Lysander yields himself a prisoner.

The captain of his guard is the brother of Rhesus.

Rhesus attempts to move him, but he is undetermined.
Lysander wants to fend a messenger to the king, who
is in a place of fancuary: Rhesus accepts the office;
and he is discovered, and taken.

This determines the brother: he frees Lysander,

and joins him. That hero has his usual success: he
conquers all opposition, kills Amphares, and pre-
serves Euanthe: but in the mean time the king, de-
luded by a firatagem from his retreat, is sacrificed to
the vengeance of the party. His funeral honours
close the play.

The moral is excellent. That the good of our

country is the sirs: human duty; and death ihould be
delpifed when it comes in opposition.

The plot is well conducted; and, after the two first
aas, is sufficiently full of business.

The. characers are properly supported; and the lan-

guage is unexceptionable. It is in general majeftick,
without false pomp: and there are some paflages,
which would have done honour to the Greeks them-
felves.-Take this example ! " Amphares, having de-
coyed Agis from his retreat in the temple; and'finding
him, when in his power, disregard his menaces, fays
to him, rou urgeyour fate: to which the monarch an-
fwers, in three words, I SCORN IT."

There is the fame sublime in this that made the

Frenchman immortal. What jhouldhe do? fays some
one to Horatius, when his son was supposed to be fly-
ing from three antagonists: the old man anfweis, DYE.

A 3 The

[6

The circumIfance has more fury in this !aft; but the
answer of Agis is as heroic, and as noble.

After our applause of the author, the next is due to

the punic, and his friends. I have seen more gaudy
audiences, but never so judicious. One might have
reckoned every man who honours rank by tasse, a-
mong them: a circle very formidable to a bad author,
but whose applause muff to a good one be the first of
human felicities.

C- T- muff not be offended that I name him,

as a patron of genius, and of virtue. He never atedL
more confiient with his characer. Why ihould the
love of patriotism, or the regard to merit, be confined:
to one scene or subjed ? It warmed one's heart to fee a
person of his judgment and known disinterested cha--
racer, conspicuously applaud, nay, begin the applause,.
where modest worth deserved it.

This is to encourage genius :- these are its best sup--

ports; and we should cherilh the few sparks that glow
among our asses.. Advantage is but the second object
of him who has true spirit: ambition is his first; and.
:if-that can be satisfied, this author feels the perfet:
pleasure,

- It were easy to add to Mr. T-'s a lbng lilt of names.
;of those who gave this play a fantion by their pa-
tronage': but a pitiful and mercenary world would
-fancy interested views ; and call it flattery.

Among the ladies, better judges than ourselves of

what regards the tender pallions, the- success was
-absolute. It was easy to read in the countenance of
lady D-, perhaps the sirs. judge in our age
of theatrical performances, her perfec fatisfadion.

In the next box, the heart perfecly joined this te-

-simony: a lady, overcome by the tenderness of the
scene, fainted.

Tbh-

Tliey-ay the breaf of authors is the cave of envy.

rdon't know whether having wrote this pamphlet will
give me title' to that honourable :addition ; but if it
do; there will be one-exceptiori-. Nothing could more
charm me, than to hear that the -earl of'B-, patron
and prot'etor'of every- science, extends--hisjuff regard
to a man injured at home by the too rigid, 'though
much to be reverenced and honoured piety of his bro-
ther clergy,: to fee him tramp the-bullion with his feal
of praise; lead by the- hands an unknown, friendless
and oppressed young'man;,'who had no one recom-
mendatidon but his merit-, procure for him :the favour
of his -prince- and give him:'that encouragement,
which is all the British want (but which.th'ey always
want) to raise them to a superiority over the whole.
world.

The public unanimity on this occasion is more-

f'range. The theatre is a house in which majorities
are common; but I thought the eloquence of a P**'
alone could breathe into them all one spirit ;- lead over-
to the fide of truth those who came determined in the
cause of error.; 'and draw her voice from, the mixedl
multitude.

* Tndeed the sentiments of the.play are fuch.as.ought,
to make a strong and universal impression upon Britons::
and mos at this peculiar juncture;

" That honour gives the soldier- only this. choice,
viAcory or death.

"That kings are born for- the good of their people.

" That it: is happier to perifl. innocently, than tp;
submit to crimes.

And " that men never should repent of virtue;:
though the reward be death."

A -.4hc. -

- " ' [8]

The people -must be indeed devoted on whom such

sentiments have no effea; whom they. do, not warm
and animate, and inspire: but this we had the joy to
fee is not the fate of Britain. The whole people felt
their force r those firit, in whom such thoughts can be
most useful, the higher ranks,the patrons of true worth,
and the friends of virtue; but from them the fame full
glow of fatisfacion and applause diffused itself to the
less elevated and refined: and if less quick in their
susceptibility, they were not leTs strongly moved.
Their eyes, their countenances, confessed the flame;
before their hands or voice expressed it: the scene
brought into life the power of the Orphalan lyre; when
in the Argonautic vessel:

High on tbe fern the Tbratian rais'd his frain,

And Argo faÂ¢n her kindred trees
Iejcendfrom Pelion to ibe main.

9raniere denmigods jlod round,

Iad mengrew beroes at tbe /ond,

Iafpir'd swith gloryJs arms.
Each chief his feven-foldjbielddifplay'd,

And bas unmbeatb'd the bining blade,
And rocks, andfeas, andJkies resoInd,

To arms, to arms, to arms! !

These are the emotions tragedy mhould raise: these

are its true effets on a brave people. This is its pro-
per office; aid in this it is scarce less honourable than
in the first sacred service, the praise of gods.

It was not only in there general sentiments of virtue

and of glory, the universal voice of this Britilh audi-
ence, worthy of that name diftinguilhed the due
sense of the author's merit, orjuft conception of the
dignity of virtue.

There were particular passages which charmed
them. Private vices appeared an object capable of

striking

firiking them with as frong impressions as public
glory.

The Prologue, not one. of the usual kind, but

something much. more proper, and much better, made
up in sentiment amply what it might be supposed to
want in that pert spirit, which has of late been the
charatcer of those appendages to tile most serious
pieces. The people received it with applauses of the
heart, much more to be desired than the idle, hasty,
and often rafl, noise of hands.

When they.who had not read,-or perhaps heard be-

fore, the rigid Spartan virtue, saw wives and mothers
arming the hulband and the son for battle ; and telling
them, that they would rather hear their death than their
dilhonour, they caught the sacred flame without ex-
ception; and there was not a Britifhl matron but for
the time was such.

I cannot believe the author aimed in any part at

personalities; for it is beneath hisgenius: perhaps'the
pit made their own application: but something there
was said of men who aimed at enriching themselves in times
of general calamity ; and it was felt severely.

Another sentiment that had, though not so suddenly,

its effea, was this: Dangers wbhen necefary oughtriot to
bejhunned... They. heard it patiently; but.when some
one named Rochefort from the boxes, the alarm was in-
ftant and was universal: the applause was not limited to
that of hands, huzzas declared the Britim approbation;
and the performance for some time was interrupted.

We owe acknowledgements to:the manager of this

theatre, for an improvement on the common praCtice,
revived, if not invented of very late time, the introdu-
cing harmony to the afiftance of sense, and the relief of
a too long attention.

This play has flewn a happy effet of it. He has

A 5 obtained

[10]

obtained the composition from a master in the old
school $; who knows how to preserve the foul and
spirit of that manner which rende.ed Purcell's name
so much- ereemed; and to soften the roughness of
its mafter-flrokes with.all the art of new-born modu-
lation.

The symphonies in the first ode are striking, and

perfecly new (a Praise of no mean rank at this time,
when plagiarism is more common in mufick even than
in writing) and they have yet so much of the old great
tyle, that could a pupil of that Purcell's have been re-
vived, he would have sworn they were his master's.

The other excellence of that great manner was the

adapting the found and measure to the sense. I think.
in this, Purcell, as he never had, never will have his.
equal: but if his fame be threatened with rivallhip, it
muff be from his hand who gave expreflion to this and.
to the other ode.

It has been said, the clergy ihould not furniih the-

:atres; and this author has, in an uncommon manner,
felt the weight of that unfair prejudice. Far from.
having reifon on its fide, the opinion denies the stags
the means of its greatest benefit, that of inculcating mo-
jality on its most pure principles: for genius in others;
is too much and too generally tinctured with infidelity:
and it precludes those who are mofl qualified to do it
honour.

Why should not the flage become the fchoolof piety,.

as well as virtue ? It may, without the too free use of
appropriated words claimed by the pulpit. This au-
thor shews it may, and he has given a true sublimity
.to many passages, from the sacred writings, where pei-
-haps few observe the glorious plagiarism.

' .J

If any.think men less devoted to the Chriftifan dc--

trines, would give a fairer face to heathen virtue; they
err extremely. This play affords full means of confuta-
tion. One inilance may.be named, with which per-
haps few others of its kind, .in. this. or any play, could.
frand in competition.

Lysander, in his prison, refleAs upon the state. of man:

The author, as this character' was pagan, gives him no
sentiments but such as suit those principles he.muss have
imbibed. in- Athens and at Sparta. He doubts, although
he hopes, a future itate of being.. He fears that man, as
he most beautifully exprelfes it,falls like the leafthat/iall
revive.no more. But his.-efolution on this uncertain,
state of thought is the greatest the human mind can. er-
tertain,.

I 'will live to-day as if I -were immortal.

Many have thought (for to few judges there are many

criticks) that the genius of Mr. Garrick is more calcu-
lated.for comedy than tragedy: I don't know whether-
his friends do not imagine it; but let those who have
entertained that opinion, observe him in thisfpcech. It
is a very finified one; and of a peculiar kind. They
v.ill not think he excels what he does there, not.in. the-
prettiett fooleries of the Wonder..

Though it is idle to praife-this fovereigh. of actors, his

full fame not-admitting augmentation; it would seem in-
sensibility to speak of the play, and not to have named
his conduct in that scene where he resigns his sword, to.
turn from the bofom.ofhis mistress that of the.ravilher.

The conflit is violent, and the scene well worked.

We do not know which part to expect he will take ;
and we are apt to blame him when he chufes to yield.
himself to certain death, and her into the arms of this
bold ruffian. The catastrophe ihews he did right; for.
on this depends her life, his own, his safety, and the
tlate's: but this we cannot at that time foresee. The.

distress

[12..

diftref is therefore the greater: it is notpoflible, con-
fidering all the circumstances, to involve. human nature
in more. This performer executes and expresses it all:
iot:his looks or gestures bnly, not the cadence of his
voice, but his voice itself, broken with anguish, tells us
he gives up with his sword all that is worth his thoughts;
even tho' he prevents the immediate death of the be-
loved Euanthe.

Whatever we want in England, taste for amusements

is'not one of the articles. Plays are the moftinftruc-
tive: with good regulations they may serve the fiate;
and they will always tend to private improvement.
Vice is so common in ordinary life, and so successful,
that, were there not the stage, wherein it is.repre-
sented in its proper colours, men (for they frequent not
churches) might forget even its nature and deformity.

Those who fee there is this value in the theatres will

not fail to observe, that, to fulfil their use, they must
encourage genius. The author no more than the fol-
dier, or the statesman rushes at once perfect into the
field wherein he is to ftew his excelience: and the
public are in all inisances equally to raifc, improve, and
perfect in their servants thole talents which may' be of
use to them.

'Tis thus true genius, thus candour judges: the

owls ofcritcifm sleep in the day of splendor and of
beauty; but if the b:ightnefs fade in any part, the
gloom, their proper day-break, wakes them; and ig-
norant of excellence, they regard only what may be
censured. 'Tis thus they beat down with their broad
heavy wings the fearful and weak infant merit: more
hateful than all human beings, except those who adopt
their doctrines.

The adverse fortune of an exil'd king

Sustains his cause in vain. Why rilk a battle,.
When the continuance of defensive war
Secur'd success and victory in Sparta ?

Would.

Would I had never left thy fplendid-court,
Delightful Sardis ! to be Sparta's queen.

Enter AMPHARES.
Welcome, AMPHARES ! Have the armies met ?

Ampb. They have. This morning, at the break of

day,

The Spartan army charg'd Achaia's host.
This and no more is known. Suspense and fear
Poflefs the people; to the gates they run,
Then to their houses: the fill whisper spreads
Thro' juftling multitudes the dread alarm.

Sand. Alas! revenge and empire now depend

On the wild issue of unruly war.
What if the arms ofAGis should prevail ?

4mpb. Although he should, the toils of fate surround

him.

Dauntless and firm our brave aflociates fland,
And with impatience wait the deftin'd hour
To ruf on AGIS. This unlook'd-for battle
Is but.a solemn prelude to the a&,
Which bold conspiracy will soon perform.
This day flall terminate the reign of AGIS,
And make, 0 Queen! all power in Sparta thine.

Sand. I fee that danger only whets the brave.

But yet, AMPHARES, if my lord is vanquifh'd,
Will not the conquering army awe the city?

Amph. AGIS hal- be the surety of our cause,

And hofrage for our safety, till we wrest
The sword from proud LYSANDER, if he conquers;
But that I fear not much. New to command
From idle Athens the mock hero comes,
Starts up a soldier, and a statesman too;
Each palm he claims: All honours must adorn
The chosen friend of visionary AGIS.

Sand. May Mars direct him so to guide the war,

As AGIS rules the state: And mutiny
Prove there as fatal as sedition here.

Atfph..

Rmph. This factious state muff change its feeble form,

Waver no more beneath a double reign
Of limited, contending, useless kings.
Henceforth 6ur monarch fall in Sparta rule,
As Jove alohein high Olympus reigns.

Sand. So reign the mighty monarchs of the East;

And such imperial power, I thought, belong'd
To Sparta's king, else I had ne'er been queen.
Young, and deceiv'd, I left my father's court
For Lacedemon's miserable sceptre.
I did endeavour to extend its sway,
And to ambition rous'd my Spartan lord.
But the vain pupil of the Grecian schools,
Unprincely AGIS, marr'd-the brave design.
Chief of the multitude, idol and slave
Of the base populace, he led the herd,
He urg'd their brutal fury on the king.

Amnpb. And now their fury on himself recoils

Like the unruly elephant, they turn,
And trample down the ranks in which they fought.

Sand. Thatis their Liberty.
Amph. Let us employ,

And then suppress, such formidable licence.
My magistracy now is near expir'd;
A king's resentment and a rival's hate
Have long hung over my devoted head:
Farewel to place, to dignity, and power,
Whilst haughty AGIS fills the Spartan throne:
I will not live obscure in Lacedemon,
Nor roam thro' Grecian states a banil'd man,
If I muff set, to rife and Ihine no more,
A fiery track ihall mark my setting fun.

Ampb. iMyl motive in attending here your presence
Merits a less injurious salutation.

Aris. I know thy merits, and'I will reward them.

Art thou not author of the woes of Sparta,
Prime mover and inflamer of sedition ?
Haft thou no; bent the power of thy high office
To the subversion of the state thou ferv'f ?
At thee this day my indignation burns.
I am dithonour'd--

Ampb. What has dilhonour'd thee ?
Agis. Thou and thy practices, they have compell'd me-

To leave the noblest- fation of a prince.
In time of war where ihould a king be found
But at his army's head ? There AGIS stood,
When you and your presumptuous Ephori
Required mv presence here. Ungrateful Spartans !
Had you allow'd me but one other day,
Then had I fought this battle for my country,
And died or conquer'd with her bravefd sons.

Ages Peril, my son ! dwells not in camps alone;

In cities, palaces, and courts of justice,
With treachery and treason fie inhabits.
Peril attended thus thou must encounter,
More hideous sure than-in the ranks of war.

Amph. I know my ations have incens'd the king.

But I imagin'd not that such suspicions
Found entertainment in your royal breats ?.

Agis.i

Agis. Haft thou not join'd the enemies of AGIS.
Thou who waft once his friend, inconstant man.

4mph. rhave oppos'd the counsel of a foe,
Whose arts depriv'd me of my prince's favour.

Agis. Thou haft pppos'd LYcuRGUS and the laws,.

Which rais'd the name of Sparta to the skies.
The Delphi{ God inrpir'd the deep design:
For more tha-hhamn was that power of thought
Which join'd the public to the private good,
With such perfection, that each felfjih paflion
Flbw'd in the channel of the common welfare,
And, like one family of sons and fires,
And dearest brothers, a great people liv'd.
In peace they liv'd without orftrife or scorn,.
In war they fought to conquer, or to die.
Equal and free, our happy fathers knew.
No interest but the interest of the fate;
*No gain but Sparta's glory; proud they bore
That palm aloft, and lhar'd the high refpeft,.
The admiration, which confenting.Greece
Paid to th' imperial virtue of their country.

Amph. Revolving time that'fyftem overthrew,
And chang'd the manners and the laws of Sparta.

Agis. The laws have been negleted, not-annull'd;,

And corrupt.rulers have corrupted manners.
Authority will soon revive the laws,
And great example yet restore the manners,
In spite of those who have opprefs'd their country,,
Depriv'd the people of their antient rights,
And while the nation funk beneath their sway,
Still strove for power in a declining kingdom,
Still fought for wealth in an impoverilh'd land..
Even at this hour rapacious they persist,
And, like rome wretches in a stranded vessel,
Plunder and riot in the midit of ruin.

Amsph. Mov'd by the present perils of the ifate,.

This signal hour I chose, unknown as yet
The fortune of the field, to.change my condut,
And make an offer of my aid to AGIS.

Ai4e

dgis. If I fhouldjudge the future by the past,
Thou must forgive me, tho' I doubt thy faith.

Ages: Yethear him, AGIS: in an hourlike this
He who affifance offers is a friend.

Agis. This hour mayyet deceive their country's foes.

I know the base foundation of that hope
Which makes my baffled enemies presume.
LYSANDER'S army in its ranks contains
The best and bravelf ofLaconia's sons;
The faction wiih and-hope defeat to them,
That Sparta's generous youth may ne'er return
To guard that freedom which has made them brave.

Ampb. The boldness of their hopes their deeds will

prove
In the assembly, if Achaia conquer.

Ages. AMPHARES, fay, what is their utmoff aim ?
Ampb. The old dependants of the exil'd king,

And all the venal members of the state,
Won by SAmNDANE'S arts and foreign gold,
Aim to restore LEONIDAS, who comes
With hoff'le armies to enslave his country:
Therefore SANDANE'S proffers I rejeced,
Have warn'd the king, and would have serv'd him too;
But since resentment and distrust prevent me,
Neutral I sand, and will not seek that welcome
Which his more artful enemies would give.

Agis. Thou fpeak'ft more boldly than becomes AM-

PHARES.

Add that to the offences I forgive.
It is the sacred maxim of my reign,
That in a prince's consecrated bread
Revenge and anger ihould not long remain.
These passions in a king afflict the fRate,
By driving raih offenders to defpaif.
This day decides your character with me.
Now let your actions prove your words sincere.

Ampb. No other terms I a&, and sure I am
Ne'er liall AMPHARES need again forgiveness.

[Exit AMPHARES.

And fear the downfal of our antient house,
The blackest fury of the Stygian realm,
The most deftruaive, is infernal Discord,
Bath'd in the blood of kings {he walks this world,
And tumbles states and empires to the ground.

Agis. Nations oft perish by their princes crime;

But now if Sparta's antient state muff fall,
Gods and good men shall witness for its king,
That he with fate contended for his people,
And on the ruins of their virtue fell. Â·

Ages Think not I mean to blame your high dc-

sign,

Age has not chang'd the tenor of my mind,
Nor pall'd my admiration of true glory.
Sprung, like thy father, from Alcides' blood,
I feel the spirit of the Spartan line.
Only let me adjure thee to beware,
And walk with caution thro' surrounding perils.
Tho' thou defpifeft every form of danger,
Think what a helpless train attends on thee,
An aged mother, and an infant son.

Agis. Divine Alcides will protet his race.
Age. I will invoke the God; in times like these

Prayers are the arms of our defenceless sex,
A spotless choir of matrons and of virgins,
Who o'er their country mourn, ryfelf will lead
To the high temple of the son of Jove.
He yet may hear the voice of supplication,
And firetch his arm to save the Spartan state.

What shou'd I think ? I have a thousand thoughts-

That

That rife and fall like waves upon the shore.
I need thee now, LYSANDER ! 0 my friend!
I lean on thee, and thou perhaps art fall'n.
Ye ever-living gods, who know my heart,
I truf in you, for righteous are my thoughts,
AIIlbent on raising up long-proftrate Sparta.
With Sparta too, I would be proud to rife,
And gain such glory as my fathers gain'd,
When Perlia's tyrant trembled at their arms.
If in this just ambition I hould perish,
My name hall go to nations yet unborn.
But I muftchange my firain; EUANTHE comes.
Alas, LYSANDER, led by love and thee,
She left her Athens for this land of broils.

Enter EUANTHE.

Euan. No tidings from the camp?

If we had loft the field, the flying rout
Ere this had reach'd our gates.

Euan. Oh ! many a dame,

Matron and virgin, tremble at this hour;
But who has cause like mine? The most forlorn
And desolate of women is EUANTHE !
If

Agis. Small the chance of what EUANTHE fears:

In the long wars of fill-contending Greece
Leaders of armies have but rarely fallen.

E;!ar. One thing I know, and with prophetic tongue

I speak it, Prince! if Sparta triumph not,
Ne'er iall your eyes again behold LYSANDER.
Disdain in him is fatal as despair.

Agis. When he returns viEtorious from the field,

Then hall he hear who best has spoke his praise.
But I mutt leave you now: The senate waits me.
Hereafter we (hall speak of this, and smile
Like mariners who on the peaceful hlore
Sit, and with pleasure talk of tempests past.

How dreadful is this interval to me,
Who am bereft and deffitute of all
Those aids that flay afflicion; and murt'bear
The weight of woe.that's heavier every hour.
The queen, and generous AGIS too, discharge
The dues of kindred with unfeigned love.
But our acquaintance is not old enough,
To yield a ripen'd sympathy, whose tate
Alone can comfort such a mind as mine.
Yet I repent me not in this extreme,
That I forsook my country and my friends.
They would have forc'd me to a loathed bed,
And torn me from the noblest of mankind.
If he ihould fall:! my love! my only love!
Shall I survive thee; and return to Athens,
Be humbled there before my haughty kindred,
And hear them blame the ashes of LYSANDER?
Forbid it, fearless love'! forbid it, Ihame!
Forbid it, honour, and my nature's pride.;
Death ihall forbid it, for I dare to die.

Rhef Soon as the trumpet from pursuit recall'd

Our conquering Spartans, in the field arriv'd
A weary messenger, 'by AGIs rent;

" With all the speed of men to Sparta haste,
" Chastise bold treason, and defend your king,"

He said; and call'd to me. With a few horse
I follow'd him: And when he fought the king,
By his command to you I brought these tidings.

Euan. Most welcome, RHEsus. But has Sparta

loft .
None of her noble youth ? :

Rbef. No man of note

Fell in the field but one, whose loss you'll mourn,
LYSANDER'S friend, Athenian PLYDORUS.

Euan. Alas! alas! my joy is mix'd with woe.

Unhappy youth! on my ill-omen'd head
The blame of thy untimely death will fall.
Condusting me, thou cam'ft to distant Sparta.
Fatal the honours Sparta's king beftow'd
Upon the generous guardian of EUANTHE.

Rbef Lady, the people of my native land,

The warlike Thracians, hold it vain to mourn
For men who fall in battle; such they deem
The favourites of MARS, our country's God.
Those they bewail who die by dire disease,
Of youth and vigor full. But molt of all
Lament old men, who drink the bitter dregs
Of life and woe,..nd in decrepit age.

Euan. Who are thole men who near the temple

Uncouth tome their garb, and strange their arms.

Rbef. They are Thracians, lady.
Emuan. What seek they here ?
Rbe. I will accost the herald,
And learn his business.

Euan. To the palace, RHESUS,

I go the willing messenger of joy.
This vicory will free the anxious Queen
From many:fears. I pray thee do not tarry,

Athenian Pallas sure has heard my prayers.

Whose rites the god of war has long delay'd,

And fortune smiles on both, yet sorrow finds
A place to fit in: but 'tis temper'd sorrow;
For never Grecian hero greater died.

Euan. He fell the vicim of his love to thee;

He follow'd thee when thou forfook'ft EUANTHE,
Left me the day I touch'd the Spartan mhore,
Tho' royal AGIs begg'd thee to remain.

Lyf. Unjust EUANTHE, thus to blame LYSANI

DER

Who fought the field, the soldier of his love
As of his sacred country: fought to gain,
With liberty, a rank and place of honour,
Such as becomes the husband of EUANTHE;
That tender name, and names that wait upon it,
Awake emotions as implacable
To tyranny, as generous and great,
As ever felf-renouncing hero own'd.
When the chief aim is right, all paflions else
Of noble kind impel the self-same way.
The lover and the huiband rouse and fire
The Spartan and the man.
Of common clay, and in one common mould
Mankind are made; but the celestial fire
That gives them life and foul, is liberty.
And I, Prometheus like, to gain that fire
For Sparta's sons, would brave the bolt of Jove;

Euan. To me you need not vaunt your daring

mind.

Alas ! LYSANDER ! I am fill afraid
Of perils lurking in this troubled slate.
O leave me not again to grief and fear,
And to AMPHARES.

Boasted his wealth, his clients, and his power;

That the remembrance of her generous.mind

Euen. Who is this faithful friend?
Ls. A Spartan dame,

A gentle one, tho' wedded to a foe
Of royal Acis. In her virgin state
She was the constant and the lov'd companion
Of fair DEIDAMIA, AGIs' fhort-iiv'd queen.
Thro' all our various strife, the generous dame
Preserves the friendships of her early days.
This scroll the king must fee. Farewel, .EUANTHE.

Euan. Its threatning I rain awakes my former

fears.

Would you had been, like me, content with love,
And never left I!yffus' flowery banks!
A fairer garland there you might have won,
Than ever war beftow'd, th' immortal wreath
Of PALLAS, queen of arts as well as arms.
But you forsook the vale, and left the shade
To climb ambition's bare and rocky height,
To ifand the forms and tempefis of the world.

LyJf Your words, like melancholy music, take

My lift'ning ear, and cause delusive sadness;
For vain the malice of our baffled foes,
And impotent will prove their last endeavours;
Pall are the forms and tempests of our fortune;

Let not EUANTIHE heed the rack of clouds,
Nor dread the murmurs of the falling main.

Euan. Elate with victory, you scorn your foes.

Before you go to AcGs.

Euan. I saw some warriors clad in horrid arms

Near yonder temple stand. Strait RHESUS knew
Thegarband arms of his own native Thrace,
And, wond'ring at the fight, went forth to learn
Who and from whence t-hey were.

Lyf That should be known.

Agis. I cannot think so basely of the people.

Yor them I have unplum'd the regal power,
And deck'd their freedom with the spoils of kings,
If they betray me; of all creatures, man
Is most ungrateful to his benefator.
The generous courser and the faithful dog
MWith true affe&tion love their gentle master;
Nay even the heavy ox, the fiubborn mule,
Dullest of beasts, they know the hand that feeds

them.

Lyf Humanity lives in thy breast, O king

Andidictates confidence unlimited.
Virtue approves the generous extreme,
And magnanimity this error loves.
Let private men indulge the glorious fault,
And set their lives and fortunes on the faith
And gratitude of those they have oblig'd;
But let feverer prudence guard the heart
Of him whose brows are circled with a crown.

Enter an OFFICER.

Offc. 0 King! the captain of Amycla's gate

Informs you that he has this hour descried
A band of men who halted near his pofd;
A thousand Thracians, they report themselves,
mir'd by AMPHARES for SELEUCUS' service.

4gis.

'Agis. A thousand Thracians!
Ofi. On their-march to Sardis.
Lyf By whose permission do they march this way ?
Of. Before the troops'arriv'd, a herald came
Who to the Ephori a message bore.

Agis. Your diligence in duty Lcommend.

[Exit OFFICER.
Lyf. The veil's withdrawn, and treason flands re-

veal'd.

Ne'er shall AMPHARES need again forgiveness.
With what a double tongue the traitor spoke!
All-feeing Gods how little do we know
The greatnets of those blessings you confer.
Had we not fought to day, had we not conquer'd,
AGIS and Sparta had been loft for ever.

Agis. This victory came like the bolt of Jove,
And levell'd their designs.

Lyf. Yet if they dare

The worf of crimes, their treason may succeed.
Your troops, your conquering troops, are not ar-

riv'd;

Th' assembly meets; unguarded there you fland -
What keeps the traitors from your noble life ?

Ag. My life! LYSANDER. No, I fear not that.

The ancient annals of this land record,
That barbarous foes revere the race divine,
And turn in battle from a Spartan king.

L)s. The multitude may till revere their lord

Who from the blood of great Alcides springs;
And yet some impious hand may strike the prince,
Altho' of virtue as of race divine.

Agis. I'll change the guards, and place at ev'ry gate
Some men of trust.

Lyf. Mount your Theffalian feed,

And meet the troops that haften to your aid.
With eager lteps the royal band advance,
And wish for nothing but their king to lead them.

Ne'er were the good and bad ,winnow'd so well,
And fever'd from each other, .Suchb the hoitsj

Of earth-born giants da'd the sons. of heav'n.

MHail, gallant RHEsus ! now'ft thou ought of those
Thy countrymen, who thus unlook'd-for come,
And in a doubtful hour perplex our councils.

Rbe. The Thracians are a thousand men con-

pleat . .

From snowy Hemus and the northern hills
Of wild Odryfus the fierce warriors come.
RHINALCES leads thern, of illufrious birth;
But, stern, imperious, and grown old in arms,
He knows no umpire but the sword, no law
Except obedience to the prince he serves.

Sgis. Such oft are those that quit a needy home
To serve as hirelings in a tyrant's hoff.

Rke. Next in command my brother Euxus stand,

A Youth to MARS devoted; for.he loves
Danger itself, not danger's rich reward.

L-. Haft thou yet seen him?
Rke. No.
L.s. Has he yet heard
That thou art herein Sparta ?

RZe. He believes

That i am still in Athens. From the herald
I kept my name and quality conceal'd;
For I fufpeced that these Thracian troops,
Though hir'd for Asia, were for Sparta meant.
If it prove so, I may be useful here:
Miy valiant brother bears a generous mind,
And,. tho' of arms enamour'd, jufice loves.

Ais,

gis. Haste to your valiant brother, and explains

With an impartial tongue, the state of Sparta.
Shew him where justice, and where honour stand.
If these are sacred, as thou fay'ft they are,
To gallant Euxus he may prove a friend.

Lyf. Exert the strong persuasion of a brother;

And tell-him, RHESUS, if he loves bright' arms,
And that immortal glory valour gains,
No more to wield a mercenary sword,
But plant himself with thee in Sparta's foil,
Where AG is willb-is noble nature cherilh,
And fea-ftis courage to such lofty deeds,
As antient tory tells of Sparta's chiefs. -

[Exit RHESUS.
Agis. I hope that RHESUS will divide the Thra-

cians:

This favours well the bias of my mind,
Averse to leave the city on suspicion,
And drive the wavering facion to extremes.

LyfJ O generous prince! whom I admire and blame. -

The greatest foe, the foe LYSANDER dreads
Is the unequall'd gentleness of AGIs.
Review the story of the Grecian fates,
And mark how freedom fell in every land.
The brave asserters of the public cause
Have ever been too mild in evil times;
Have, like indulgent parents, spar'd the rod,
And let the vices of their children live -
To kill the virtues. Hence, let AGis learn,
The only lesson that his nature needs.

Agis. Uncertain is the peril if I stay,

But certain is the evil if I fly.
I will remain; but to assure my safety, -
You must, LYSANDER, to the troops return.

Lyf. And leave my prince alone amidst his foes t-

Revoke the hard command. If you're refolv'd
To brave the peril, then my place I claim
Next to your person; by your fide I tand;

-B 5 Perhaps

Perhaps some noble service I may render,
Receive the mortal wound aim'd at my princes
And with my life redeem the life of AGIS.

Agis. Your great imagination's up in arms;

But hear me, and let calmer reason judge.
I am determin'd not to quit the city,
The guilt of civil war mall not be mine.
LYSANDER'S pretence here without the troops
Would but embolden and excite my foes,
Who may be tempted by this fair occasion,
This mighty vantage to furprize us both.
Without delay, once more, LYSANDER, arm,
And ostentatiously pass thro' the gate.
This victory, and the approaching host,
Will hush the threatned form.

Lyf. So may it prove.

But there is something in my heart rebels
Againfi this counsel! Oh I cannot leave you--
Nor ought I now to stay. Let never man
Say in the morning that the day's his own:
Things pafi belong to memory alone;
-Things future are the property of hope.
The narrow line, the isthmus of these seas,
The infant scarce divisible, is all
That mortals have to iland on. O my prince !
ILYSAKDER leaves you with a heavy heart.

Agis. Farewel, thou Spartan of the antient mould,
Dear as the brother of his blood to AGIS !

[TIey embrace and part.

Lyf. Ha! may beaven your purpose change
Agis. My will is six'd. But though my judgment

too

Confirms the secret counsel of my heart,
Yet l may be deceiv'd ? perhaps, my friend,

Agis. Mitake me not, I feel no new impreflion,

Nor if I did, ihould I by that be alter'd;
For such presages be they fad or joyful,
I deem them but the meteors of the mind,
Bred by the inward elemental strife,
When great events perplex and shake the foul.
My thoughts regard the state. If I ihould fall,
To thee, LYSANDER, I commit my son,
The only pledge of my DEIDAMIA'S love.
Train up the boy to walk in the fame path
Which we have trod together, the strait path'
Of virtue and true glory. If he proves
Of noble nature, and I hope no less,
He will not fhun'the lofty path of honour,
Tho' fate ihould mark it with his father's blood.

Lyf Hear this; immortal Gods! who rule the

world,

And guard a prince the image of yourselves!
O never, never may his royal race
LYSAND ER'S aid require.

Affeftion choaks his words,

His generous heart bursts at this solemn parting.
In times like these of a declining state,
Baseness infecs the general race of men;
But yet these trying times rear up a few
More excellent, refin'd, and conscious spirits.
More principled, and fit for all events,
Than any in the good, but equal, mass
Of a far better age. Such is LYSA.NDER

Lyf

Lyf. Wert thou but safely plac'd, LYSANDER knows

Whathe fould do. I must not tarry here.
There is a temple in this spacious city,
Forfanatity above all others fam'd,
To Juno sacred, the avenging Queen !
Thither a trufiy slave of AGis' house
Will guide thy tfeps;. by my command he waits-
Without the palace.

Euan. Whither doff thou go ?
Lyf. In this inglorious garb difguis'd, I wait

Till night and darkness come; then I attempt
The wall wheree'er I find it slightly guarded.
What mortal arm shall then oppose my way,.
Urg'd as I am ? Alas, my lov'd EUANTHE !
From my compliance with thy fond request
Springs the worst evil of this dreadful hour.
I have betray'd the confidence ofAGIs;
But I'll repair my fault.

E.an. What dost thou mean ?
Lyf A-ils commanded me to leave the city;

And thinks, would to the Gods he thought aright!
That his LYSANDER heads the Spartan troops,
In whom his only hope of safety lies.
But I, EUANTHE ! partial to thy will,
Sought thee in vain. 'In that unhappy time
They seiz'd the gates, and shut me up in Sparta,
Fate puniihes with too severe a doom.
The human weakness of indulgent love.
AGIS ! I come !-For the deep voices now
Of duty, friendship, gratitude, and glory,
Sound thro' my breast, and from my beating heart-
Their echo, rings. Farewel ! my love, farewel !

Eatan. Not yet, LYSAXDER ! Ac-is is oppreft,

And Sparta too. Does duty, or does honour,
Require LYSAXDER, like an eastern slave,
To fall attendant on the royal pile ?
What can you do ? The army will betray you:
So with the few, the faithful few that love you,

You'll

Youll do some desperate a&tion, and be flamni
If you despise your life, yet think of me,
The prey of curfltAMPHAREs.

Lyf. Infernal Gods!

Let me not think:of that. Retire, E.UAFTHE,
And in the hallow'd temple reft secure.
This night I'll force ill-guarded Sparta's gates,
And save my prince, my country, and EUANTHPE

Euan. Thy prince, thy country are already los

O liften, and preserve thyfelfand me:
The ship that bore me to the Spartan fliore
Rides still at anchor: leave this wretched land.
Wheree'er thou goeft I will attend thy fleps;
Thy gods shall be my gods; thy people, mine-

Ls. Alas! EUANTHE does not fee the shame,

The ruin of that couniel love inspires.
Th' eternal gods repose this hour in me
No common trust: Upon my deeds depend
The fate of AGs,- and the fate of Sparta.
My soldiers too, my brave, my faithful soldiers,
The meanest warrior of the royal band
Freely devotes his life to godlike AGIS.
And mhall their leader, shall the friend of AoIs,
Forsake his prince? I will forget thywords;
Repeat them not.

Euan. Is this LYSANDER's love!

Must I not speak ? Is my reward reproach ?
For you I left my friends and native land,
Defy'd all danger, and all censure fcorn'd;
Now in my fore distress I call on thee
For whom I flffer, to proteet my honour,
And in my fore distress dost thou upbraid me ?
If ever maid, like credulous EUAxTHE,
Bursts all the bonds of nature for one man,
Let her beware that he be not a Spartan !
0 wretched maid ! O Athens loft in vain!

[Ready to faint.
Lfr. All-ruling powers! why am I thus diftreft

VWhy

Why come calamities so thick upon me ?
EUANTHE, hear me; you Ihall be obey'd.
I'll bear thee hence, and go with thee to Athens,
Restore thee to thy country and thy friends,
Of whom thou dost complain I have bereft thee.
LYSANDER will acquit himself to thee,
And to mankind--

Euan. Delude me not. Alas!

Thy tongue speaks comfort; but thy voice, thy looks,
Wild and unsettled, drive me to despair:
For thou, methinks, art desperate, LYSANDER.
Those lips that quiver, and those eyes that roll
Like dragon's eyes, those are not signs of love!
Thou fay'lt that thou wilt bear me back to Athens;
Will that acquit thee, if thou leav'fl me there
Is that thy purpose ?

LyfJ Yes. I'll leave the world.

And death shall wipe diflonour from my name;
AcGI and Sparta ihall forgive me then,
And every debt be paid.

Eliin. LYSANDER, no.

Love's victims are not of your sterner sex,
It is the defliny of womankind
Constant to live, and desolate to die.
To itrong neceflity EUANTHE yields.
If I should tear you from the fide of Acts,
I fee my fate; you ne'er would love me more:
Tho' you should live, yet you would die to me.
But I will rather flay and perili here
Than live without thee. Go, and fight for AGIS
But in the hour of danger think of me!
Calm in the rear direa the course of battle,
The dreadful van let other warriors lead,
In whom nor AGIS nor EUANTHE lives.

Ls. These words become my idoliz'd EUANTHE!

And honour now approves the voice of love.
0 thou firfl object of my young desires,

And

And thro' each period of my ripening years
Still more maturely and intensely lov'd,
Hear and believe my words.-Beware-Beware.

Recent from blood and treason, doff thou come
To take by force and violence my heart?

But frill triumphant reigns the viaor's queen.

But now to rail is madness. Wi:h one word

Rhesus is taken.

Lyrf My contagious fate
InfeCts my friends ! my brave, my generous Rbefus 1

Eux. Friend of my brother! first I set thee free.

An officer of mine commands that gate
At which the Thracians enter'd; haste thee thither,
Array'd like one of those whom I will fend
To guide thy iteps.

Lif Ye guardian Gods of Greece!

Whose ways myflerious fondly I arraign'd,
Forgive my rashness ! Prosper now my sword-- .
Where are my arms ?
[WhilfL Lysander feaks Euxus beckons one of his /oldiers

Eux. Here enter, and obey
Without reply.

[Exeunt Lysander and the Thracian to the ower.

The soldiers hearts are mine:
Their various toils and perils I have shar'd,
And more than ihar'd, the firit in hard extremes,
When signal danger claims a leader's sword.
No spoil, no treasure, have I e'er referv'd;
The wealth I covet is the soldier's love.
My bold Odryfians are a faithful band;
In this distress I'll throw myself on them,
They will support me.

Enter a Spartan Mefenger.

MefJ Leader of Thracian bands !

Amipbares and the magistrates of Sparta,
Met in the fenate-houfe, expect thy presence.

Eux. I will attend them. [Exit mefenger.

Surely they have learned,
That I am brother to ill-fated Rhesus.

Enter Lysander in Thrarian drefi and arms.

Lyf Once more at liberty ! Once more in arms!
To thee, brave Thracian-

Eux. I am fummon'd hence

To meet the Ephori. Ifear, my lord,
They have difcover'd Rhefiu is my brother..

Lyf. That secret in your breast and his is lodg'd.:

Nor can his alter'd features now betray him.
In early youth he left his native land;
The heat of summer, and the winter's cold,
In many a hard campaign, have chas'd his bloom;

Euw. Indeed, I knew him not.

r: ..

Ls. Then who could know him ?

Calm and determin'd to the fenate.go:
Here I'll remain, and wait your quick return.
To know what they design imports us much.

Eux. Your fay is full of danger; rilk it not.
Ls. All necessary dangers must be rifk'd.

Perhaps I am the subjef of their councils,
Perhaps I may be call'd before the senate.
If I appear not, you muff be difcover'd,
And myefcape too soon to them be known.

Eux, Your reasons are.of-force. I am convinc'd,

Here, take my sword. Then, if we are betray'd,
My troopsa beyyou.- Now, my bold Sithontes,

[To one of his Thraciaans.

Draw your-battalion nearer -to the square.
And guard the person of this Spartan chief,
As you would guard myself. If I'm detain'd,
Follow to death or victory, Lysander.

[Exit Euxus.

Lrf: Shall I obey the impulse of my heart,

And lead these Thracians to the tower thar holds
My loftEuanthe ? No, let reason rule.
Amphares wilk not, dares not, wrong her honour,
Whilf undecided is the fate of Agis.
LTis night. but never shall the morning rife.
On--Who can know the secret will of heaven!
Tell me, ye inextinguiihable fires,
That light the counsels of eternal Jove,
Have you, since Time began his long career,
Beheld a mortal like Lysander tofl ?
Down, down, enthusiasm-! my heart-be calm I
A little while, and thou salt beat no more.
Oft have I wilh'd for perilous occasions;
And, wandring in the academic grove,
Have rous'd myself with itrong imagination
Of great exploits by ardent valour done:
But ne'er did fancy's tempeIt match the truth,
The frrong reality of such a storm.
O did'I combat but for life alone,
Were Sparta and Euanfbt safe fpeatrors.
How gaily riould Lysander take the field.--

Enter a Spartan, Agis following.

Agis. This way conduas not to Amycla's gate;
Ha ! whither dofl thou lead me ?

.mph. To thy Aeath. The

The Ephori of Sparta have condemn'd thee.

agis. I am betray'd! What mockery is this

Offacredjuftice? Lay aside the robes
And ensigns of authority prophan'd:
The pomp of magistracy suits not treason.

,nmph. The licence of thy tongue affronts the laws,
Whose awful reverence our office guards.

Agis. Know ye not this, ye guardians of the laws,

The meanest citizen of Lacedemon
Without free trial cannot be condemn'd.;
Much lefsyour king. What law have I tranfgrefs'd?
Point out my crime; produce my bold accusers.

Amp. Thy crime is tyranny.
Agis. Is that my-crime -

Had- 4is been a tyrant, thou had't been
His fanning slave, thou enemy of freedom:

Amp. Behold the stubborn spirit of this man:

He breathes his native arrogance, and still
Insults his judges, and avows his crimes.

Agis. Who made you judges of the life of Agis ?

But you have judg'd: yourselves, and earth,and heaven
Know how uijuftly. To theGods above,
-The sure avengers of a murder'd king,
I make my last appeal. Their messenger
's on the wing; Lysander comes apace;
And Nemesis direts his righteous sword.

Ampb. Proceeds this boldness from thy trust in him?

Thy great avenger is, like thee, a captive,
.And uhder the fame mortal sentence lies.

Agis. Ye powers above ! Lyfnder too a captive !
Where was he taken ?

Amph. In the streets of Sparta,
Clad in the servile garment of a Helot.

Agis. Alas! alas! Lfander ! 0 my friend!

Thy love for me, thy generous, fearless love,
Has wrought thy fall. For me thou cam'tc to Spartat
And, like the parent bird hov'ring too near
Its captive young, thy noble life is loft !---
Forgive these tears, my country ! Agis weeps
For thee. Alas! thy brave defender's gone.

Till all thy generous youths have bled in.vain .

And grasp thee in the circle of his enpire..
My native land, the kingdom of my fathers,
Shall be' no more a nation ! 0 my country,
How irretrievable is thy condition!
The Macedonian vulture hovers o'er thee,
Soon to descend, and on thy vitals prey.

Amph. Thou may:st delay, perhaps avoid, thy death.

Send forth"'thy mandate to theroyal.baind,
To halt till further orders.

Agis. Ha! No more . , .

I trust thee, traitor. Would I had ever.been
Thus deaf to thee ! No, let the royal band
Revenge their gallant leader and their king.

Firfl Ephore.
Thou tempt'ft thy fate.

Agis. I scorn it. Since my hope

Of Sparta's loft, and my beloved friend
Has perilh'd in my cause, why should I live '?
In any period of my former days
I rather would have chose to die attempting
The glorious design, which you have ruin'd,
Than live the prince of a degenerate people,
The tame fpeftator of a falling empire,

F' irft Epihore.
To reason hearken.

Agis. Reason bids me die,

As I have liv'd unalter'd in my love
To Sparta, and unconquer'd in my purpose.
You mean to take advantage of my state,
Without fpe&ator, counsellor, or friend:
You think I dread the stern approach of death,
Because the blooming season of my life
Still promises a long extent of years:
But my forefathers blood is in my veins,
The blood of heroes, and of Spartan kings,

A Spartan king descended from the Gods.

The traitors favour'd; some efcap'd our swords,
But many more in the {harp combat fell.

Ampb. Did their fierce leader fall ?
Me/:. Above the reft

Conipicuous he fought; at him each sword
Was pointed. If he fell not on the spot,
Sure he received wounds that must fatal prove.

Amtb. Confirm me that, and I will mock at fate;

Command my troops, that in the Forum watch,
To join Rhinaces. I myself will follow.

Those charms divine he never shall enjoy.

'To the fame turret where 4Amphares' troops
Guarded the queen, whose mantle on the ground
She spied, and wrapt it round her wretched head;
When suddenly a stern assassin came,
And flabb'd her, as that queen whose robe he wore.
Arriving then, I heard her ihriek for help,

For virtue triumphs over all:

When Jove decrees a nation's doom,
He calls their heroes to the tomb.
Fearless they fall, immortal rife,
And claim the freedom of the skies.

Virtue triumphs over all!
Such a king shall ne'er return:
Our country and ourselves we mourn,

Alike was great Alcides' doom.
Yet then mot .worthy of his fire,

Eight hundred years it fourih'd, great in arms,
On dangers rose, and grew amidjt alarms.

More lrong, more noble than Lycurgus' lazs :

In Britain's cause exert your matehle/s charms,
And rouse your lovcrs to the love of arms.
Hid, not extinct, the spark of valur lies;
Your breathJhall raise it faming to the 'ies.
Now Mars his bloody banner hangs in ai",
And bids Britannia' sons for tear prepare.
Let each lov'd maid, each nmthcr brin2 the jiclcd,
And arm their country's champions for the fld.
Arm'd andlnjfamn'd each BritiJ breafl shall burn,
No youth unlaurel'djhall to you return.

In glory's field, by Heroes- not our own.

And dread the vengeance of her antient Lord.
