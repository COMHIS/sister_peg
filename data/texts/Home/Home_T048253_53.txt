And marks for death the noble.and the brave.

The furious tyrant from the frontier haftes,

And, breathing vengeance, rufles upon Rome:
Here fira opp.s'd, tenfold his fury burns;
Here, in the pass of fate, our father stands,
Defies and flops the monster in his rage,
'Till Rome's last legions come to give him battle.

When destiny hangs on a single day,

No, PAULUS, no! it is not fame alole
That TITus seeks to purchase from the foe j
Tho' such a crime the gods and menwould pardon.

And.know the hated cause of all our ills,
That army, only brave against their country,

Whom nature for a gladiato form'd,

EmILIUS.

And bless my children ! ha ! your looks are keen.
Your's chiefly, -TITUS ! what hath flirr'd your spirit '
How points the enemy ? This quiet night,
in preparation palt, portends a florm.

PAULUS.

On that attack which threats the eastern gate
The enemy hath labour'd all.night long,
Repairing what the river's rage had ruin'd.

EMILIUS.

It was a friendly flood. The river god
With all his waters guards his native walls;
On that strong quarter they can ne'er prevail.
The north I fear, where yon ltupendous tower
Our works commands.

TITUS.
It ihall not long command,.
Let but the consul grant me my desire.

E MILIUS.
What would my son ?

TITus.

Their tower is weakly guarded.

At break of day, a soldier from yon camp
Fled to my poll; hollow and gaunt he was
His hfrivell'd limbs scarce bore his founding arms.
Like him, he (aid, with toil and famine worn,
Were half the tyrant's holt. For MAXIMIN,
Mad with delay, and fiercer from repulse,
Reviles his soldiers, drives them to the trench
With whips and lharp reproach. This day, o'ercome
By strong neceffty, he breathes a while,
And fends his legions forth; to gather in
Whatever this exhaufted.reginr.yields.
I saw the busy foragers in troops ' '
Mhlch, and difperfe.themfelves on every fide,
Like payfulchildren.on a.fummer day,

Secure

Secure and careless; for no martial band
Of late hath falliedfrom our guarded gates.
This is the time. Permit me, O my father!
Now to attack their ill defended lines, . , .''
And fire that mighty tower in which'they trust.

. .MILIUS.

Well haft thou spoke, my fonJ thy zeal I love,
Nor must thy lkill and judgment .pass unprais'd.,
Be thus attentive till, Land trust mee TI Tus,. s ,-

Danger comes on; Typhsaus-like itccomes, .

CORNELIA.
Why is my lord alone ? WVher are my sons ?

This day, CORNELIA, brings us welcome tidings,
The Emperor approaches with his host.

CORN L LIA.
Thanks to the gods ! But fay, where are my childrcn ?

E .MILIA.
This inflant I expec them to return.

CORNELIA.
From whence, .EMILIUS?

AJEILIUS.

From the northern gdte.

TITUS had form'd a brave, a great design;
But when assurance of relief arriv'd,
My PAULUS hasten'd to :ecal his brother.

CORNELIA.

1Tis as I sear'd. PAULU.: will come too late.
The omens of the gods must be fulfill'd

,EMILIUS.
Whit evil omens has CORNELIA seen?

CORNELIA.

'Tis firange to tell; but as I flumb'ring lay,
About that hour when glad Aurora springs,
To chace the lagging shades, methought I was
In Rome, and full of pea:e the city feem'd.
My mind oblivious too had loft it's care.
Serene I fep'd along the lofty hall,
Imbellifh'd with the statues of our fathers,
When suddenly an univcrfal groan
fflued at once from every marble breaP:.
Aghast I gaz'd around ! when slowly down
From their high pedeftalh; I saw descend
The murder'd GRACCH.l Hand in hand, the brothers

StaikdJ

Stalk'd towards me. As they apprcach'd more near,
They were no more the GRACCHI, but my sons
PA L U and TITUS. At that dreadful change
I fLhrizk'd and wak'. But never from irymind '
The e:a2cle f£1ll part. Their rueful eyes
Threi cheeks of frone! the look of death and woe !
So firange a 'ion ne'er from fancy rose.
The refr, my lord ! this holy Priefl can tell.

E-MILIUS.

Vhy thsisis nothing but a common dream;
For often n

whn te waking mind is charg'd

With apprehsnfion of uncertain ills,
Imagination, is the hour of reft,
Prefenteth wild fantastic combinations,
That have a shade and tincture of the pafl:
But 'tis the weakness of the human- mind
That join; the vain ,afemblage to futurity.

PRIEST.

Men rearon thus, my lord ! who think their reason
Can grasp and meafiure all; presumptuous thought!
Sounds more than human have been often heard,
And fnlpes ce!lefial seen, by mortal mad
But yet mofl frequent in the silent night
Are warnings given by firange portentuous dreams.
The hifory of mighty Rome abounds
In awful instances. The old republic
By them has oft been fway'd, and oft preferv'd;

,M I5: .IU.S.

But tell me, Priest of JovE ! what do the gods 2
By their more certain omens now declare ?

PrIEST.

Consul ! w/ih the mofl venerable rites
That our religion klows, I have perform'd
A sacrifice to CapitolGan JdOE,
This pious matron prefnt-: never yet
Sinac at the altars of the gods I food

Did

Did I behold such omens of calamity.
Yet they were intricate, ambiguous, dark;
And tho' some parts I might interpret fair,
Even these were mix'd and full ds dire perplexity.
No further can I fee into the cloud,
That veils the will of heaven; but this I fay,
And by the scepter of the god I' serve
It is the truth: Some dreadful danger hangs
O'er thee thyself, this city, or thy race.

(Shout.)

CORNELIA.
Ha! what means that shout ?

.EMILIUS.

It is a joyful shout.

Behold the cause: fee,where that dufly smoke
Darkens the air. And now the flame burfis out;
Their turret blazes, and my TITUS conquers.

CORNELTA.

O heaven and earth! 0 son too well belov'd.!
Why do these cruel omens check my joy?

Yet not unfrequent in this changeful world
Are woes like thine; and greater fill than thine.
The famous matron of thy name and blood,
The firfR CORNELIA, saw her godlike sons
In Rome betray'd, and slain oy Roman hands.
And oft in every age have wretched mothers
Snriv'd their families', their country's ruin,
And liv'd fad captives in a foreign land:
No kindred ear to hear, no eye to weep
In pity of their woes: no human face
foe them to look on, but the hateful face

Of

Of foes, who made them ch !dcfs, widows, slaves.
To thee remain thy hu'band, and thy country,
In whose defence thy sons so greatly died.
Thee Rome shall honour, and revere in thee
The sacred memory of her hI roes slain.

jEM ILIU .

It is the right, the birthright, of our house,
For Rome to die: in every signal ftlife,
In every firuggling period of the (Rate,
My fires have bled. My fens have chose their time;
Bravely they fought, and nobly were they slain.
Rome tfill shall fland, tho' the , MILII fall
The tyrant's works are level 'd with the ground,
And his proud tower yet fm okes upon the plain.
Our ramparts now his fierce aflaults defy; .
The Roman army, like a gather'd flori,

Amidst the common heap, my children lie.
Majeftick PAULUS, and my lovely T'r us,
Is this the end of all your mother's care ?
Some fierce barbarian now insults the dead;
Adding dishonest wounds. 0! might not gold
Their dear remains redeem ? Alas ! alas !
'Tis the sole consolation I can hope for,
To save them from the beasts and birds of prey,
That howl and scream around there fatal walls.
To fold once more their bodies in my arms;
To lay them decent on the funeral pile,
And o'er their ashes pour a parent's heart.

They iiuf not die. It were a deed, to frike
Horror from pole to pole. The Parthian fierce,
And the wild Moor-would tremble at the tale,
And mark accurst the- pale of Roman empire. ' - -
Tyrant, too savage over beasts to rule !
Fidelity to thee were horrid treason
To human nature, to the gracious gods,
Who o'er difirefi humanity preside.
This day has full difplay'd the tyrant's foul,
And ripen'd thoughts long growing in my breast.
'Tis vain to think of antient freedom now;
The senate, and bhe'people are ho more.
Rome's vast dominions for the scepter call,
The world fubdu'd, one maftermuft command.
But let us have a monarch, not a tyrant.

That plac'd her sovereign confidence in thee...
Now hear the counsel of a faithful friend,
Anxious for thee, and zealous for his country.

EMILIUS.

No vain desire of glory rules my breast;
I feel the throbs of nature: all I with
Is to be jult to Rome; I envy not,
Nor emulate the older Brutus' fame.

Rome Ihall not susser: when her troops draw near,
I will forsake the tyrant's Ihatter'd fide,
And fix the fortune of the future field.

On mine alone, let all thy wrath descend; '

And havock round him, such a ruin fell.

Thine eye on empty space, and gaze on air ?
Can'st thou descry the future, or perceive
Events accompliih'd, tho' unknown ?

The weary fifers reft. CYLLENlus-comes,
Like a bright meteor fireaming down.the vault
Of azure heaven; in his right hand the rod,
And in his left, a laurel dropping blood,
Behold!
