Spoken by Mr. SPARKIS.

N antient times, when Britain's trade was arms,
And the lov'd music of her youth alarms.

A god-lie race filain'dfair England's fame:.
Who has not heard of gallant PIERCY's name?
Ay, and of DOUGLAS? Such illuflrious foes
In rival Rome and Carthage never rose!
From age to age bright /hone the BritJh fire,
And every hero wuas a hero's fire.
When powerful fate decreed one warrior's doom,
Upfprung the Phenix from his warrior's tomb.
Budt whilf those generous warriors fought andfell,
Those generous rivals lov'd each other well:
Though many a bloody field was loJf and 'won,
Nothing in hate, in honour all vas done,
lWhen PIERCY wrong'd, defy'd his prince or peers,
Fajl came the DOUGLAS, with his Scotth spears; -
And, when proud DOUGLAS made his 'ing his foe,
For DOUGLAS, PIERCY beni his Englih bow,
Expell'd their native homes by adverfeifae,
They kneck'd alternate at each other's gate:
Then blaz'd the caqle, a! the midnight hour,
For him who.se arms hadlJfook its frmfl tow:,r.

This night a DOUGLAS your protecion claims;

A wife! a mother ! pity's /fftcJ names:
rThJefory of her woes indulgent hear,
And grant your fippliant allJhe becr, a tear:
In confidence Jh begs; and hopes tofind
Each Englijh breaj?, like noble PIERCY'S kind.

~Ve Court of a Cafll, firrrunded wilth k'cods.

Enter Lady RAP.DOLPH.

YE Woods and Wilds, whose melancholy gloom
IAccords with my foul's sadness, and draws forth
The voice of sorrow from my bursting heart,
Farewell a while: I will not leave you long;
For in your shades I deem some spirit dwells,
Who from the chiding stream or growing oak,
Still hears and answers to Matilda's moan.
0 DOUGLAS! DOUGLAS! if departed guests
Are e'er permitted to review this world,
Within the circle of the wood thou art,
And with the passion of immortals hear'st
My lamentation; hear'st thy wretched wife
Weep for her husband slain, her infant loft,
My brother's timeless death I seem to mourn,
Who perifh'd with thee on this fatal day.
To thee I lift my voice; to thee address
The plaint which mortal ear has never heard,
O disregard me not though I am call'd
Another's now, my heart is wholly thine
Incapable of change, affeifon lies
Buried my DOUGLAS, in thy bloody grave. -
But Randolph comes, whom fate has made my Lord,

' >

To chide my anguish, and defraud the dead.

Enter Lord RANDOLPH.
Ld. Ran. Again these weeds of woe! fay, do'flthoi

well

To feed a paflion which consumes thy life
The living claim 4ome duty; vainly thou
Beltow'tel thy cares upon the silent dead.

La.Ran. Silent, alas ! is he for whom.I mourn:

Childless, without memorial of his name,
He only now in my remembrance lives,
This fatal day itirs my time fettled sorrow,
Troubles afresh the fountain of my heart.

Ld. Ron. When was it of pure sadness ! These black

weeds

Express the wonted colour of thy mind,
For ever dark and dismal. Seven long years
Are pars'd, since we were join'd by sacred ties:
Clouds all the while have hung upon thy brow,
Nor broke, nor parted by one gleam of joys
Time, that wears out the trace of deepest anguifi,
As the feafmooths the prints made in the sand,
H1as pa31 o'er thee in vain.

La. Ran. If time to come

Should prove as ineffeauai, yet my Lord,
Thou cans not blame me. When-our Scottish youth
Vy'd with each other for my luckless love,
Oft I besought them, I implor'd them all
Not to afgail me with my father's aid,
Nor blend their better deftiny-with mine:
For melancholly had congeal'd my blood,
And froze affetion in my chilly breast.
At last my Sire, rous'd with the'bafe attempt
To force me from him, which'thoa rend'red'ft vain,
To his own daughter bow'd his hoary head,
Befonght me to commiserate his age,
And vow'd he Ihou'd not, could not die in peace,
Un!efs he saw me wedded, and fecur'd'
From violence and outrage.en, my Lord! .
In my extreme ditlrefs ig ee,:

a,
J~ n' ..-^.^-, ..-

Thee I befpake, profefs'd my strong desire
To lead a single, solitary life,
And begg'd thy nobleness, not to demand
Her for a wife whose heart was dead to love.
How thou perfifted'ft after this, thou know'it,
And must confers that am not unjust,
Nor more to thee than to myself injurious.

Ld. Ran. That I confess; yet ever must regret

The grief I cannot cure. Would thou wert not
Compos'd of grief and tenderness alone,
But had'st a spark of other paflions in thee,
Pride, anger, vanity, the strong desire
Of admiration, dear to woman kind;
These might contend with, and allay thy grief,
As meeting tides and currents smooth our firth.

La. Ran. To such a cause the human mind oft owes

Its transient calm, a calm I envy not.
Ld. Ran. Sure thou art not the daughter of Sir Mal,

colm:

Strong was his rage, eternal his resentment:
For when thy brother fell, he fmil'd to hear
That DOUGLAS' son in the fame field was slain.

La. Ran. Oh! rake not up the ashes of my fathers:

Implacable resentment was their crime,
And grievous has the expiation been.

Contending with the DOUGLAS, gallant lives

Of either house were loft; my ancestors
Compell'd, at last, to leave their antient feat
On Tiviot's pleasant banks; and now, of them
No heir is left. Had they not been so stern,
I had not been the last of all my race.

Ld. Ran. Thy grief wrests to its purposes my words

I never alk'd of thee that ardent love,
Which in the breasts of fancy's children burns.
Decent affection, and complacent kindness
Were all I wish'd for; but I wish'd in vain.
Hence with the less regret my eyes behold
The florm of war that gathers o'er this land:
If I should perilh by the Danifl sword,

Matilda would not hied bon tear the moro.

LA. RAN. Thou dost not think so: woful as I ami

I lov.e thy merit, and efteenm thy virtues'.
But whither goeft thda now?- -

Ld. Ran. Straight-to the camps -

Where every warri6or on'the-tipitoe:ftaiids
Of- expeoation -and impatient afles
Each who arrives, if he-is- come'-to tell
The Danes are landed. - -

La. Ran. 0, may adverse winds *

_Far from the coast of Sc4tland, drive their fleet!
And every soldier of -bbth 'hbots retnih - :
In peace and safety to his pleasant home?

Ld. Ran. Thou speak's a womwn's hear a warrior's

wish: -

-

Right From their native land, the fRormy north,
May the wind blow, till the keel is six'd
Immoveable in Caledonia's strand' !- ;'-
Then shall our foes repeint their bold invalion-
And roving armies fhun(the fatat shore.

La. Ran. War I detest; but war with foreign foesi

Whose manner, language, and wvhbfe looks& are..ftrange;
Is not so horrid, not to me so hateful,
As that which with our-neighbours oft we wage.
A river here,-there an ideal ine
By fancy drawn, divides the ifter kingdoms.
On each fide dwells a people similar,
As twins are to each other, valiant both,
Both for their valour famous through the world ;
Yet will they not- untie their ldieed. arms,
And, if they mutl have war, wage dillant war,
But with each other fight: in cruel confliA ,
Gallant in strife, and noble in their ire, .
The battle is their pastime. They go forth
Gay in the morningk as tofumrmer:fpart:.
When ev'ning omaes,- the glory of :thi tnern,
The youthful warrior is a clod- ds lay..
Thus fall the prime of either hapefs iand :..
And such the fruit of Scotch and Engli'h war

Ld. Ran. I'll hear no more: this melody would make

A soldier drop his sword, and doff his arms,
Sit down and weep the conquests he has made;
Yea (like a monk) ling reft and peace in heaven
To fouls of warriors in his battle slain.
Lady, farewell: I leave thee n6t alone;
Yonder comes one whose love makes duty light. [Exit.

Enter Anna;

Ann. Forgive thl rashness of your Anna's love:

Urg'd by affection,-I have thus prefum'd
To interruptyour solitary thoughts;
And warn you of the hours that you neglet,
And lose in sadness. -

La. Ran. So to lose my hours
Is all the use I wish to make of time.

Ann. To blame thee, lady, suits nor with my state:

But sure I am, since death firt prey'd on man,
Never did sifter thus a brother mourn.
What had your sorrows been, if you had loft,
In early youth, the huiband of your heart

La. Ran. Oh !.
Ann. Have I diftreRf you with officious love,

And ill tim'd mention of your brother's fate?
Forgive me, lady: humble though I am,
The mind I bear partakes not of my fortune;
So fervently I love you, that to dry
These piteous tears, I'd throw my life away.
La. Ran. What power dire&ted thy unconscious

. tongue
To speak as thou halt done ? to name-

Ann. I-know not:

But since my words have made my miRfrefs tremble,
I will speak so no more; but silent miix
My tears with her's...

La. Ran. No, thou fIalt not be silent.

I'll trust thy faithful love, and thou shalt be
Hencefortli th' inftru&ed partner of miy woes,
But what apails it ?. Can thy feeble pity
RI1 back the flood ps Oever ebbing time .

B

Compel the tnh and ocea to giv up
Their dead tlive?

The tale wpt upin lyar amazing words
Deign to unfold.

La. Ran. Alas! an ciemf eud,

Hereditary evil, ws the foare
Of my misfoftnne tuliUtgte decreed,
That my tave bmtbtr 'iloid abatle save
The life of Dougl/':sm, mr itoul's fee:

Impatient. Douglas to Balarmo came,
Under a~ eirv mn --My heart e gain'd;

Had o'er us flown, wenriny lovd lord was call'd
To fight his 'ft baslsts; and with him,
.In fpi of alli y teFs, 'did Mlcom go.

That the falie ftrangeraws lord Dras' son.

And from the gulh of hell dematio cry,
To take diaulai ns iwintdig wy.

Ann. Alas ! how-sew of woman's fearful liad
Durit own a troth so hardy !

La. Ran. The girft truth

Is easiest to avow. This moral learn,
This precious moral, from my tragic tale-w
Jn a few days the dreadful tidings came
That Douglas and mj brother both were lain.
My lord! my life! my hulband !--mighty God !
What had I done to merit such aflition ?

Ann. My dearest lady ! many a tale of tears

I've listen'd to; but never did I hear V
A tale so fad as this.

La. Ran. In the fiift days

Of my diftrafting grief, I found myself-.- ---
As women wih. to be who love their lords.
But who darft tell my sifter I The good pries
Who join'd our hands, my brother's ancient tutor,
With his lov'd Malcom, in the battle fell.
They two alone were privy to the marriage.
On silence and concealment I refolv'd.
Till time should make my father's fortune mine.
That very night on which my son was born,
My nurse, the only confident I had,
Set out with him to reach her fiRer's house:
But nurse, or infant, have I never seen,
Nor heard of, Anna, since that fatal hour. '-
My murder'd child I had thy fond mother sear'd
The los 'of thee, she had loud fame defy'd,
Defpis'd her father's rage, thy father's grief,
And wander'd with thee through the scorning world.

Ain. Not seen or heard of! then perhaps he lives.
La. Ran. No. Itwas dark December: wind and rain

Had beat-all night. Across the Carron lay
The deftin'd road; and in its swelling flood
My faithful servant perifh'd with my child.
O hapless son ! of a most hapless fire .

1

But they are both at reft; and I alone
Dwell in this world of woe, condemn'd to walk,
Like a guilt-troubl'd ghost, my painful-rounds:.

; 2

Nor has dfpitefil fate permitted me
The comfort of a foliiarv sorrow.
Though dead to love, I xas compell'd to wed
Randolph, who fiatch'd me from a villain's. arms;
And Randolph now pofl'efs sthefe domains,
That by Sir bNalcolm's death on rue devolv'd;
Domains, that floould to Doeglas' on have giv'n
A baron's title, and a baron's power.
ti'uch were my soothing thoughts, .while I bewail'd
'The fl;ughter'd father of a son unborn.
And when that son came, like a ray from heaven,
Which Ihines and difapjiears; alas! mv child!
How loogd/id thy fond mother grafl the hoIe
Of havingthee, ..:e knew not how, rcRor'd.
Year after year hath wbrn her hope away;
But left still undiminifh'd her delire.

Ann. The-hard that sis th th.erven threid of life,
May fm-ioth thelength that's'et to come of your's.

La. Raz. Not in this world: I hare conlder'd well

Jts virious evilr,'and on whom they fall.
Alas ! how oft does goodncfs wound itself,
And fwect affeation prove the spring of woe.
( ! had Idy'd ieon my luv'd husband fell
And some good ange op'd to.me the book
Of providence, .ard let me' read my.life,

Is doubly irlfome in an-hour like this,

Arm. WIyfieaks mv'lady this of Randolph's heir?
La. Ran. kbecife he's.not the. heir .of lardolph's

virtues. .

Suabde and firewd,-f be ofers to mankiad.
An artificial ima;ge'of hinife!f:

And he with ease can vary to the taRe
Of different menj its features. Self denied,
And master of his appetites he seems;
But his fierce nature,'like a'fox chain'd up,
Watches to seize unseen the wish'd for prey.
Never were vice and virtue pois'd so ill,
As in Glenalvon's unrelenting mind.
Yet he is brave and politic in war,
And ifands aloft in these unruly times.
Whv I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter:
Stay and detain him till I reach the castle.

[Exit Lady Randolph

Ann. 0 ! happiness where art thou to be found ?

1 fee thou dwelleft not with birth ahd beauty,
Though grac'd with grandeur, and in wealth array'd;
Nor dost thou, it would feei, with virtue dwell;
Else had this gentle lady mifs'd thee not.

Enter GLEMALIVON.

Glen. What dofl thou muse on, meditating maid ?

Like some entranc'd and visionary seer
On earth thou ftand'ft, thy thoughts ascend to heaven.

Ann. Wou'd that I were, e'en as thou say's, a seer,
To have my doubts by heavenly vision clear'd !

Glen. What dost thou doubt of? what haft thou to do

With subjects intricate ? Thy youth, thy beauty,
Cannot be queftion'd: think of thefc good gifts
And then thy contemplations will be pleaing.

Ann. Let women view yon monument of woe,

Then boast of beauty; who so fair as 1he ?
But I mufl follow: this revolving day
Awakes~the memory of her ancient woes.

[Exit Anna

So!-Lady Randolph 1huns me; by and by
I'll woo her as the lion wooes his bride;
The deed's a doing now, that makes me lord
Of there rich valleys, and a chief of power,
The season is most apt my founding ileps
Will not be heard amidst the din of arrhs

# ACT II.

Randolph has liv'd too long: his better fate
Had the afjpUdant once, and kept me down:
When I had seiz'd the dame, by chance he came,
Refcu'd, and had the lady for his labour;
I fcap'd unknown; a slender consolation !
Heaven is my witness that I io not love
To low in yelil, a.d. let others reap
The jocund harvef. Yet I am not safe:
By love, or fonetbing.like it, fting inflam'd,
t'adly I blabb'd my passion to his wife,
And the has threaten'd to acquaint him of it.
The way of woman's will I do not know:
But well I know the laron's ir'rath is deadly.
t will not live in fear: the man 1 dread
s as a Dane to inc; ay, and the. man
Who stAnds betwixtme and my chief desire.
No bar but he; flie has nD tinfA an near :

,a.R .
R.. kt vain the ifranger's fears! how fares my

Lord!

Ld. Ran. That it fares well, ihanks to this gallant

youth,:

W.hose valour fav'd me from a wretched death !
As down the waking dale I walk'd alone,
At the crofts way four men attack'd me:
Rovers, I judge, from the licentious camp,
Who would have quickly laid Lord Randolph low,
Had not this brave and generous Atranger come,
Like my good angel, in the hour of fate,
And, mocking danger, made the foes his own.
They turn'd upon him , but his active arm
Struck to ;the ground, from whence-they rose no more,
The fiercest two; the others fled amain,
And left him maller of the bloody field.
Speak, Lady Randolph; upon beauty's tongue
Dwell accents pleafig to the.brave and bold.
Speak, noble dame, and thank him him for thy lord.

La. Ran. My lord, I cannot (peak what now I feel,

My heart o'erflows with gratitude to heaven,
And to this hoble youth, who all nmknewn
To yout and- yurs, deliberated not,
Nor paus'd at peril, but humanely brave
Fought on your fde, agaibi such fearful odds.
Have you yet learn'd of him -wh.r you ihould thank ?
Whom call the saviour of Lord Randolph's 'life ?

Ld. Ran. I aik'd that question, and he-anfwer'd not:
But I must know who my deliverer is. ( TherS ranger.

Strang. A lot born man, of parentage ebfctre,

Wlio nought can boast, but his desire to be
A soldier, and to gain a name in arms.

Ld. Ran. Whoe'er thou art, thy fpirii is ennobled

By the great King of kings! thou art ordain'd
And ftampt a heio:by the Sovereign hand · ·
Of nature ! blufli not, flower of modesty
As well as valour, to declare lty birth.

Stran. My-name is NORVAL :on theCrampianihils

My fatherfeeds his flocks: afrugal swain
Whose conitant cares-were to inc'eafe his store,
And keep his only son, myself, at. home.

For I had heard of battles, and I long'd
To follow to the field iome warlike lord:
And heaven soon granted what my fire deny'd.
This moon which rose lall night, round as my fhiicll,
Had not yet fill'd her horns, when, by her light.
A band of fierce balbiarians, from the hills,
Rufh'd like a torrent down upon the vale,
Sweeping our flocks and herds. The lliepherds fled
For safety, and for succour, I alone,
Vcith bended bew, and quiver full of arrows,
Hover'd about the enemy, and malk'd
The road they took, then haftcd to my friends
Whom, with a troop us fifty chosen men,
I met advancing. The pursuit I led,
Till we o'ertook the spoil encumbcr'd foe.
We fought and conquer'd. Eie a sword was drawn,
An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,
Wo wore that day the arms which I now wear.
Returning home in triumph, I difdain'd
The fheplerd3 slothful life; and having heard
That our good king had furmon'd his bold peers
To lead their warriors to the Carron fide,
I left my father's house, and took with nec
A chosen servant to conduc my steps: -
Yon trembling coward, who forsook his nmfter.
Journeying with this intent, I pall these towers,
And, heaven-directed, came this day to do
The happy deed that gilds my humble name.
-Ld. Ran. He is as wife as brave. Was ever tale
With such a gallant modesty rehears'd ?
My brave deliv'rer ! thou ihalt enter now
A nobler lilt, and in a monarch's fight
Contend with princes for the prize of famc.
I will present thee to our Scottith king,
Wlhofe valiant spirit ever valour lov'd.
Ha! my Matilda ! wherefore ifarts that tear ?

La. Ran. I cannot ay : for various affeclion:,

And strangely mingled, in my bosom swell;
Ycl each of them may well command a te;a.

I joy that thou art safe; and I admire
l-im and his fortunes who hath wrought thy safety
Yea, as my mind predicts, with thine own.
Oblcure and friendless, he the'army fought,
Bent upon peril, in the range of death
RLsIlv'd to hunt for fame, in the range of death
To gain diftindion which his birth deny'd.
In this attempt unknown he might have perilh'd,
And gain'd, with all his.valour, but oblivion.
Now grac'd by thee, his virtues serves no more
Beneath despair. The soldier now of hope
He stands conSpicuous; fame and great renown
Are brought within the compass of his sword.
On this my mind reflected, whilst you spoke,
And blefs'd the wonder-working Lord of heaven.

Ld. Ran. Pious and grateful ever are thy thoughts!

My deeds (hall follow where thou ppint'ft the-way.
Next to myself, and equal to Glenalvon,
In honour and command thall NVorqal be.

TNorv. I know not how to thank you. Rude:I am,

In speech and manners: never till this hour
Stood I in such a presence: yet my lord,
There's something in my breafl, which makes me bold
To fay, that Norvnl ne'er will shame thy favour,

La. Ran. I will be fvorn thou wilt not.. Thou ihalt

ba

\Vir' hlappy valour guard the life of Randolph..

Ld. Ra:. Well haft tliou spoke. Let me forbid reply-.

We are thy debtors fill; thy: high desert
O'ertops our gratitude. . I nmu proceed,
As was at first intended, to the camp...
diome of my train I fee, are fpreacdig.thifer,
impatient, doubtless, of their lord's, delay.
JGo with me, N'rval, and thine eyes lhall lee
The chosen warriors of thy native land,
Who languish for. the fight, and beat. t.e air
With briaidili'd swords.

Acrv. Let us begone, my lord.
Ld. Ran. [To Lady Randolph.] About the time that

the declining fun

Shall his broad ortit o'er yon hills suspend,
Expe& us to return. This night once more
Within there walls I reft; my tent I pitch
To-morrow in the field. Prepare the seass,
Free is his heart who for his country fights:
He in the eve of battle may refgn
Himself to social pleasure; sweetest then,
When danger to a soldier's foul endears
The human joy that never may return.

My boy with blooming Norval might have numb.r'd.
Whilst thus I mus'd, a spark from fancy fell
On my fad heart, and kindled up a fondness
For this young stranger, wand'ring from, his home,
And like an orphan cast upon my care.
I will protct thee (said I to myself)
With all my power, and grace with all my favour.

Ann. Sure heaven will bless so gen'tius a resolve,

You must, my noble dame, exert your power
You must awake: devices will be fraind,
And arrows pointed at the breast of Norval.

La. Ran. Glenalvon's false and crafty head vAil work

Against a rival in his kinsman's love.
If I deter him not: I only can.
Bold as he is, Glenalvon will beware
How he pulls down tie fabric that I rai.e.
I'll be the artist of.young Norval's furtune.
'Tis pleasing to admire: moit apt was I
To this affecion in my better days;
Though now I seem to you ihrunk up, retir'd
Within the narrow cornpafs of my woe.
Have you not fomeimes seen an earLy flAwcr
Opea its bud, 4nd Iprcad its filkca lkvc, .

C

To catch sweet airs, and odours to bellow;
Then, by the keen blast nipt, pull in its leaves,
And, though still living, die to scent and beauty ?
Emblem of me: afflition, like a storm,
Hath kill'd the forward blossom of my heart.

Enter GLENALVON.

Glen. Where is my dearelf kinsman, noble Randolph?
La. Ran. Have you not heard, Glenalvon, of the

basle

Glen. I have: and that the villains may not'fcape,

With a itrong band I have begirt the wood:
If they lurk there, alive thesy llall be taken,
And torture force fioom them th' important secret,
Whedler some foe of Randolph hir'd their swords,
Or if-

La. Ran. That care becomes a kinfinan's love.
I have a counsel for Glenalvon's ear. [Exit Anna.

Gin. To him your counsels always are commands.
La. Ran. I have not found so: thou art known to me.
G.'n. Known!
La. Ran And moll certain is my cause of knowledge.
GLCn. m\ hat do you know ? by the. molt blessed cross

You much amaze me. No created being,
Yourfeif except, durnt thus accost Glenalvon.

La. Ran. Is guilt so bold ? and dost thou make a merit

Of thy pretended meekness ! This to me,
Who, with a gentleness which duty blames,. ,

.

Have hitherto concea'd, what, if aivulg'd, -
Would make thee nothing; or, what's worse than that,
An outcalt beggar, and unpity'd too i
For mortals fnudder at a crime like thine.

Glen. Thy. virtue awes me. First of womankind!

Permit me yet to fay, that the fond man
Whom love transports beyond flrit virtues bounds,
If he is brought by love to mifrry,
In fortune ruin'd, is in mind forlorn,
Unpity'd cannot be. Pity's the amns
Which on such beggars freely is beftow'd:
For mortals know that love is flill their lord,

And o'er their vain resolves advances till
As fire, when kindled: by out shepherds, moves .
Through the dry heath against the fanning wind.

La. Ran. Reerve these accepts for some other ear'

To love's apology I liften not.:
Mark thou my words; for it is! meet thou lhould'.L:
His brave deliv'rer Randolph here retains,
Perhaps his presence may not please thee well:
But, at thy peril, practise aught against him :.
Let not thy jealousy attempt to ,hake
And loosen. the good.ioot he has in Randolph.;
Whose favourites I know thou haft supplanted.
Thou look'it at me, as if thou fain wonldft pry
Into my heart. 'Tis open as my speech.
I give this early caution, and put on
The curb, before, thy temper breaks away.
The friendless itranger my protection claims:
His friend I am, and be not thou his foe. [Exit.

And be the ihallow fool of coward conscience!
I am not what I have been: what I 1hould be.
The darts of destiny have almost pierc'd
My marble heart. Had I one grain of faith
In holy legends, and religious tales,
I Ihould conclude there was an arm above
That fought against me, and malignant turn'd,
To catch myself, the subtle snare I set.
Why, rape and murder are not simple means!
Th' imperfet rape to Randolph gave a spouse.
And the intended murder introduc'd :
A favourite to hide the fun from me ;.
And worst of all, a rival. Burning hell!

lWhen view'd, and call'd upon, amlaz'd he fled.

Eternal justice is in this nmoft just

La. Ran. 0 ! Anna hear !- once more I charge

thee speak

The truth dired: for there to ime foretell
And certify a part of thy narration; -
With which if the remainder tallies not,
An initant and a dreadful death'abides thee.

Prif. Then thus adjur'd, I'l-p;ea;k to thee as just

As if you were the miniftcr f.heaven,
Sent down to fcarch the secret fins of men,

Some eighteen years ago, I reptcd'land

Of brave Sir Malcolm, !then Balarmo's lord;
But falling to decay, his servants seiz'd
All that I had, and then turn'd me and mine
(Four helpless infaats and their weeping mother)
Out to the mercy of the winter-winds.

A little hovel by the river's fide
Received us ! there hard labour, and the fiill
In fishing, which was formerly my sport,
Supported lifei Whilf thus we poorly liv'd,
One stormy night, as I remember well,
The wind and rain beat hard upon our roof:
led came the river down, and loud and oft
The angry spirit of the water fhriek'd.
At the dead hour of night was heard the cry
Of one in jeopardy. I rose, and ran
To where the circling eddy of a pool
Beneath the ford, us'd oft to bring within
My reach, whatever floating thing the stream
Had caught. The voice was ceased the person loft:
But looking fad and earnest en the waters,
By the moon's light I saw, whirl'd round and round,
A baflet: soon I drew it to the bank,
And neitled curious there an infant lay.

La. Ran. Was he alive ?
Prif. He was.
La. Ran.. Inhuman that thou art!
How could'it thou kill what waves and tempeits spar'd ?

pif. I am not so inhuman.
La. Ran. Didft thou not?
Ann. My noble miltrefs, you are mov'd too much:

This man has not the aspect of stern murder:
Let him go on, and you, I hope, will hear
Good tidings of your kinsman's long loft child.

PrifJ The needy man, who has known better days,

Or.e whom distress has spited at the world,
Is he whom tempting fiends would pitch upon
To do such deeds, as make the prolperous men
Lift up their hands, and wonder ~who could do them.
And such a man was I; a man declin'd,
UWho saw no end of black adverfiry:
Yet for the wealth of kingdoms, I would not
Have touch'd that infant, with a hand of harm.

La. Ran. Ha! dost thou fay so ? Then perhaps he

lives !

<s D

Prif Not many days ago he was alive.
La. Ran. 0 ! God of heaven ! did he .then die so

lately ?

Pri. I did not fay he died: I hope he lives:

Not many days ago these eyes beheld
Him, flourishing in youth, and health, and beauty.

La. Ran. Where is he now ?
Pri. Alas ! I know not whee.
La. Ran. Oh fate! I fear thee f:ils. Thou -riddkt,

Ipeak
Direct and clear, else I will fearchi thy foul.

Arn. Permit me, ever honour'd 1 Keen impatience,

Though hard to be reftra'md, defeats itself.--
Purife -iy Iftry with a faithful tongue,
To the lall hour that thou didlt -eep the child.

'Prif. tear 'ot my faith, tho' I muifll fpe'k my Ihame.

Within the cradle, where the infant lay.
Was ftow'd a mighty tore of gold and jewels;
Tempted by which we did refoke to fhide,
From all the world, this wonderful event,
And like a peafantbreed the noble child.
That .nme might mark the change of our elate,
We left the country, travell'd to the north,
Bought flocks and herds, and gradually brought forth
Ourfecret wealth. ButxGod's all-feeing eye
Beheld our avarice, 'and smote us fore.
For one by one all eur own children died.
And he, The itranger, sole remaind the'heir
Of 'what -ideed was his. 'Fain'then wouldt,
-Who with a fther's fondness ov'd the boy,
Have trufted!him, 'now in the :dawn of youth,
With hisown secret; -butrniy anxious wife,

Meanwhile the ftripling'grew in years and beauty;
And, as we oft obferv'd, 'he:bore hinfelf,
Not as the offspring of-our cottage'blood;
For nature will break out; mild with the mild,
Bkt'~ihthe froward:he was!fiere as -ire,
And night and day he talk'd of war and arms,

I set myself against his warlike bent;
But all in vain ; for when a desperate band
Of robbers from the savage mountains came-

La. Ran. Eternal providence ! What is thy name
Prif. My name is Norval: and my name he-bears.
La. Ran. 'Tis he; 'tis be bimfelf ! It is my son !

0 sovereign mercy ! 'Twas my child I saw !
No wonder, Anna, that my bosom burn'd..

Ann. Just are you tranoports; ne'er was woman's

heart

Prov'd with such fierce extremes. High fated dame!
But yet remember that thou art beheld
By servile eyes; your geflures may be seen
Impaffion'd strange; perhaps your word o'erheard.
Ka. Ran. Well dost thou counsel, Anna, Heaven be-

stow
Oa me that wifdomr which my state requires!

Ann. The moments of deliberation pass,

And soon you must resolve. This useful maa
Muff be difmifs'd in safety, ere my lord
Shall with his brave deliverer return.

Prf I

I I amidst astonishment and fear,

Have of your words and gestures rightly judg'd,
Thou art the daughter of my antientmafer;
The child I refctid from the flood is thine.

La. Ran, With thee dissimulation now were vain.

I am indeed the daughter of Sir Malcolm;
The child thou refcu'dhl from the flood is mine.

Prif. BlefR be the hour that made me a poor man!

My poverty has said my tbaer's house!
La. Ran. Thy words furprize me: fare thou doff not

feign:

The tear sands in thine eye: such love from thee
Sir Malcolm's house deferv'd not: if aright
Thou told'ft the sory of thy own diftreif.

Prif. Sir Malcolm of our baron's was the.flower;

The faftelt friend, the best, the kindest maifer:
But ah! he knew not of my fad estate.
After that battle, where his gallant son,

D2

Your own brave brother, fell, the good old lord
Grew desperate and reckless of the world;
And never, as the reft was won, went forth
To overlook the condut of his servants . -
By then I was thrust out, and them I blame:
May heaven so judge me as I judg'd my mailer I
And God so love me as I love his race

La. Ran. His race dull yet reward thee. On thy

faith

Depends the fate of thy lov'd mailer's house,
Rememli'reft thoq a ii tie lvely hur,
Tat like a holy hermitage appears
Among the clefts of Carron o

PrY: -I remember
The cottage of the clifts.

La. Ran. 'Tis that I mean:

There dwells a man of venerable age,
Who in my father's service spent his youth s
Tell him I sent thee, and with him remain,
'Till I shall call upon thee to declare,
Before the king and nobles, what thou know'ft
To nie'haft tol. No more but this, and thou
'-halt live in honour all thy future days;
Thy son so long (hall call thee father still,
Andal the land {hall bless the man, who fav'd
The tan of Douglas, and Sir Malcolm's heir.
Remember well mv words: if thouldft meet
Him whom thou call'ft thy son, still call him so;
And mention nothing of his nobler father.

Prf: Fear not that I hall mar so fair an harvest,

By putting in my fickle ere tis-ripe.
Why did I leave my home and antient dame ?
-To ir[d the youth, to tell him all I knew,
And make him wear these jewels'in his arms:
Which might I thought, be challeng'd, and so bring
To light the secret of his'noble birth.

Were sweetly simple, and full oft deceiv'd
Those trivial mortals, who seem always wife.

Perhaps too far; at least my nicer fears

G!ie. Noble dame !

The hov'ring Dane at laU his men hath landed:
No band of pirates; but a mighty hopft
That come to fettle where their valour conquers;
To win a country, or to lose themfqlves.

La. Ran. But whence comes this intelligence, Glen.

alvon ?

Glen. A nimble courier tent from yonder camp,

To haften up the chieftains of the -north,
Inform'd me as he pat, that the fierce Dane
Hlad on the eastern coast of Lothian landed,
Near to that place where the fea-rock imnmenfe,
Amaziug Bass, looks o'er a fertile land,

La Ran. Then miul this western army march to join
The warlike troops that guard Edina's tow'rs

Glen. Beyond all question. If impairing time

Has not ,eftac' the image of a place,
Once perfec in my breast, there is a wild
Which lies to westward of .that mighty rock,
And seems by nature formed for the camp
Of water-wafted armies, whofe.ohief strength
Lies in firm foot, utflank'd with warlike horse:
If martial lkill directs the Danish lords,
There inaccessible their army lies -
To our swift fcow'ring-horfe, the bloody-field
Miit man to man, and foot tofoot, be fought..

La. Ran. How many mothers {hall bewail their sons

How many widows weep their husbands slain !
Ye dames of Denmark ! ev'rtfor you I.feel,
Who, sadly fitting on the :feabeat Ihore,
Long look for lords that neverlifall return.

Are objecs suited to Glenalvon's foul.
Scorn is mere grievous than thepains of death;
Reproach more piercing than the.pointed sword.
La. Ran. I scorn thee not, but when :I ought to

Nor e'er reproach'd, but-when insultcd virtue

I own thy worth, Glenalvon; none more apt
Than Ilto praise thine eminence in-arms,
And be theeccho of thy martial ifame.

Of Europe, when he bold Godfedo led,

Pleas'd with my admiration, and the fire
His speech struck froM me, the old man would hakl:e
His yearsaway, arid dat his young encounteirs:
Then, having flhewl'd his wouhds, he'd fit him down,
And all the live-long day difcdtlrf of war.
To help mi- fanncy, in the finooth gteen tuirf
He cut the figures of the marshall'd hosts;
Dfcrib'd thle mrtioii and explain'd the ule
Of the deep column, and the length'd line,
The square, the crescent¥ and the phatanx firm.
For all that Saracen, or Christian knew
Of war's vast art, was to this hermit known.

Ld Ran. But nmy delivrers dead!.

The world did once esteem Lord Randolph well,
Sincere of heart, for spotless lqpour fam'd:
And in my early days, glory I gain'd
Beneath the holy banner of the cross;
Now pal the noon of life, Ihaine:comes upon-me;
Reproach,: and infamy, and public hate,
Are near at hand; for all mankind will think
That Randolph t!fely Aabi'd, Sir itTalcp's heit.

La. R4in. Where aml now? still in this wretched

Grief cannot break a heart so hard as mine.

With hole's afliftance bore the brunt of sorrow;
And train'd me on to he the objet now,
On which omnipotence displays itself,
Making a fpetale, a tale of met

Of thee, and of thy valour ! my fond heart

Of growing old amidst a race of thine,
Who might make up to me their father's childhood,
And bear my brother's and My huiband's name

That ever blest the world! Wretch that I am,
Who saw that noble spirit swell and rife
Above the narroi limits that confin'd it !
Yet never was by all thy virtues won
To do thee juitice, and reveal the secret,
Which timely known, had rais'd thee far above
The villain's snare. Oh ! I am punifh'd now!
These are the hairs that Iholnd hae ftrew'd the ground,
And not the locks of Douglas,

Though flan and baffled by the hand he hated.

Ann. My lord, my lord!

Ann. Horror indeed!
Ld. Ran. Matilda!
Ann. Is no more.

She ran, lhe flew like light'ning up the hill,
Nor halted till the precipice ihe gain'd,
Benathe whose low'ring top the river falls
Ingulph'd in rifted rocks : thither (he camer
As fearless as the eagle lights upon it,
And headlong down----

Ld. Ran. 'Twas I ! alas ! twas I

That fill'd her breast with fury; drove her down
The precipice of death! Wretch that I am!

Ann. O had you seen her last despairing look!

Upon the brink {he fRood, and cast her eyes
Down on the deep: then lifting up her head
And her white hands to heav'n, teeming to fayt
Why am I forc'd to this ? She plunged herself
Into the empty air.

Ld. Ran. I will not vents

In vain complaints, the passion of my foul.
Peace in this world 1 never can enjoy.
These wounds the gratitude of Randolph gave.
They Tpeak aloud, and with the voice of fate
Denounce my doom, I am refolv'd. Ill go
Straight to the battle, where the man that makes
Me turn aside must threaten worse than death.
Thou, faithful to thy miftrefsi take this ring.
Full warrant of my power. Let every rite
With cost and pomp upon their funerals wait;
For Randolph hopes he never (hall return.

# EPILOGUE

Spoken by Mr. BARRY.
AN Epilogue I aflc'd but not one word

One bard will write. He vows 'tis nioft absurd

With comic wit to contradict the strain
Of tragedy, and make your fbrrows vaini
Sadly he 'fs, that pity is the best
The noblen paIfion of the human breast:
For when its sacred itreams the heart o'erflow,
In guihes pleasure with. the tide of woe;
And when it's waves retire, like those of Nile,
They leave behind them such a golden foil,
That there the virtues without culture grow,
There the sweet blossoms of affe&ion blow.
These were his words;-void of delusive art
I felt them; for he spoke them from hls heart#
Nor will I now attempt, with witty folly,
To chace away celestial melancholy.
