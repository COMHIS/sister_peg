My Dear Adam

I received your letter & send you inclosed a security which I hope will be deemed sufficient for Mr Linds salary & emoluments. Mr McKenzie writes to Lord Milton by the Saturday post to promote the resignation on Lord Butes name & I beg that you will urge it, with all convenient despatch. I cannot express to you of what consequence it  may be to me to be quickly put in possession of that office if Lind hangs back. I impower you to offer him four hundred pounds for an immediate resegnation. I am very desirous at the same time to obtain it without the money, but would not wait two months for the difference. I shall not come to Scotland till it is decided if there is so remarkable battle here. I shall come say soon after it is. I am

My Dear Adam 
ever yours
