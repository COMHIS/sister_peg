TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS

G E O R G E

PRI N CEof WALES.

S I R,
IN Dedications, especially those which

Poets write, Mankind expea to find

little Sentiment, and less Truth. A
grateful Imagination adorns its Benefactor
with every Virtue, and even flatters with
Sincerity. Hence the Portrait of each
Patron of the Muses is drawn with the
fame Outline, and finished as a Model of
PerfeEion. Inftru&ted by the Errors of
others, I presume not to make the Pane-

A 2 gyrick

gyrick of the Prince of: WALES, norto.
extol the Patronage of Literature as the
most shining Quality of a Prince. Your
Royal Highness will permit me to men-
tion one fort of Patronage which can
never be praised too much; that, I mean,
which extending its Influence to the whole
Society, forms and excites the Genius of
Individuals by exalting the Spirit of the
State.

Iniititutions, that revive in a great and

highly. civilized People those Virtues of
Courage, Manhood, and Love of their
Country, which are most apt, in the Pro-
grefs of Refinement, to decay, produce at
the fame time that pleasing and ornamen-
tal Genius, which cannot subsist in a Mind
that does not partake of those Qualities
which it describes. This is an Obferva-

tion

tion which has escaped the Notice of the.
greater Part of Writers, who have inqui-
red into the Causes of the Growth and
Decay of Poetry and Eloquence; but it has
not escaped the Penetration of LONGINUS,
who writing in the Decline of. the ROMAN
Empire, and lamenting that the true Sub-
lime was not to be found in the Works of
his Time, boldly imputes that Defet to
the Change of Policy; and enumerates with
Indignation the Vices of Avarice, Effemi-
nacy, and Pusillanimity, which arising from
the Loss of Liberty, had so inthralled and
debased the Minds of Men, that they could
not look up, as he calls it, to any thing
elevated and sublime: And here, as in
other Questions, the great Critic quotes
the Authority of his Master HOMER. The
Day of Slavery bereaves a Man of half his
Virtue, The Experience of fuicceeding

Times

Times has Ihewn that Genius is affected
by Changes less violent than the Loss of
Liberty; that it ever flourishes in Times
of Vigour and Enterprize, and langui/hes
amidst the sure Corruption of an inactive
Age.

Your Royal Highness, as Heir appa.

rent of the Briti/h Empire, hath in view
the noblest Field that ever a laudable Am-
bition entered. The envied State of this
Nation cannot remain precisely as it is;
the Tide must flow, or ebb faster than i:
has ever flowed. A Prince defilned in
such a Period to reign, begins a memorable
]Era of PerfeHtion or Degeneracy. The
serious Cares and princely Studies of your
Youth, the visible Tenor of your generous
and constant Mind, have filled the Breasts
of all good Men with hopes of you equal

to

to their Withes. That these Hopes may
be fulfilled in their utmost Extent, is the
sincere and ardent Prayer of

Tour Royal Highness's

mloft humble,

zmol obedient,
and mofl devoted Servant,

hbe court of a castle surrounded with woos.

Enter Lady RANDOLPH.
yW 7E woods and wilds,-whofe melancholy gloom

Accords with myfoul's sadness, and draws forth
The voice of sorrow from my bursting heart,

Farewel a while: I will not leave you long;
For in your shades I deem tome spirit dwells, .
Who from the chiding stream, or groaning oak,
Still hears, and anflers.to MAT ILDA'S moan.
0 DOUGLAS ! DOUGLAS! if departed ghosts
Are e'er permitted to review this world,
Within the circle of that wood thou art,
And with the paflion of immortals hear'lt
My.lamentation: hear'it thy wretched wife
Weep for her hufband.flain; her infant loft.

B 4. My

My brother's timeless death I seem to mourn ;
Who perifh'd with thee on this fatal day.
To thee I lift my voice; to thee address
The plaint which mortal ear has never heard.
O disregard me not; tho' I am call'd
Another's now, my heart is wholly thine.
Incapable of change, affection lies
Buried, my DOUGLAs, in thy bloody grave.
But RANDOLPH comes, whom fate has made my Lord,
To chide my anguish, and defraud the dead.

Enter Lord RANDOLPPH.

Again these weeds of woe! fay, dolt thou well
To feed a pafion which consumes thy life?
The living claim Come duty; vainly thou
Bestow's thy cares upon the silent dead.

Lady RANDOLPH.

Silent, alas ! is he for whom I mourn:
Childless, without memorial of his name,
He only now in my remembrance live3.
This fatal day stirs my time-fettled sorrow,
Troubles afrems the fountain of my heart.

Lord RANDOLPH.

W'hen was it pure of sadness ! These black weeds
Express the wonted colour of thy mind,
For ever dark and dismal. Seven long years
Are pais'd, since we were join'd by sacred ties:
Clouds all the while have hung upon thy brow,
Nor broke, nor parted by one gleam ofjoy.

Time,

Time, that wears out the trace ofdeepefR anguish,
As the sea smooths the prints made in the sand,
Has pal o'er thee in vain.

Lady RANDOLPH.

If time to come

Should prove as ineffectual, yet, my Lord,
Thou canst not blame me. When our Scottish youth
Vy'd with each other for my luckless love,
Oft I besought them, I implor'd them all
Not to assail me with my father's aid,
Nor blend their better destiny with mine.
For melancholy had congeal'd my blood,
And froze affeftion in my chilly breast.
At las my Sire, rous'd with the base attempt
To force me from him, which thou rend'red'ft vain,
To his own daughter bow'd his hoary head,
Besought me to commiserate his age,
And vow'd he should not, could not die in peace,
Unless he saw me wedded, and fecur'd
From violence and outrage. Then, my Lord!
In my extreme distress I call'd on thee,
Thee I befpake, profefs'd my firong desire
To lead a single, solitary life,
And begg'd thy Nobleness, not to demand
Her for a wife whose heart was dead to love.
How thou perfifted'i after this, thou know't,
And mud confers that I am not unjust,
Nor more to thee than to myfelfinjurious,

B 5 LorW

-Lord RANDOLPH. .

That I confefi;. yet ever must regret
The griefI cannot cure. Would thou wert not
Compos'd of grief.and tenderness alone,
But had't a spark of other paflions in thee,
Pride, anger, vanity, the strong desire
Of admiration, dear to woman-kind;
Thefe.might contend'with,'and allay thy grief,
As meeting tides and currents smooth our firth.

Lady RANDOLPH.

To such a cause the human mind oft owes
Its transient calm, a calm I envy not.

Lord RANDOLPH.

Sure thou art not the daughter of Sir MALCOLM:
Strong was his rage, eternal his resentment:
F6r when thy brother fell, he fmil'd to hear
That DOUGLAS' son in the fame field was slain.

Lady RANDOLPH.

Oh !'rakenot up the ashes of my fathers:
Implacable resentment was:iheir crime,
Andpgievous has the expiation been.
Contending with the DOUGLAS, gallsit lives
Of either house were loft; my ancestors
Compell'd, at last, to leave their ancient feat
On Tiviot's pleasant banks; and now, of them
No heir is left. Had they not been so itern,
I had not been the last of all my.race.

Lord RAND6LPH.
Thy grief wrests to its purposes my words.

~ .; ~' '
' " ..;' I never

I never aik'd of thee that ardent love,
Which in the' breais of fancy's childreii burns.
Decent affetion arid complacent kindness
Were all I wish'd for; but I wisi'd in vain.
Hence with the less regret riy eyes behold
The storm of war that gathers o'er this land:
If I Ihould perih by the Danish sword,
MATILDA would not -ied one tear the more.

Lady RANDOLPH.

Thou do'st not think so: woeful as I am,
1 love thy merit, and eteem thy virtues.
But whither go'ft thou now ?

Lord RANDOLPH.

Straight to the camp,

Where every warrior on the tip-toe Rands
Of expectation, and impatient aiks
Each-who arrives, if he is come to-tell
The Danes are landed.

Lady RANDOLPH.

0, nmay adverse wihds,

Far from the coat of Scotland, drive their fleet!
And every soldier of both hosts return
In peace ard safety to'his'pleafant home-!

Loid RANDOLPH.

Thou fpeak'ft'a worman's. hear a warrior's vifi..:

Then hall our foes repent their.bold invasion,
And roving armies shun the fatal hore.

Lady RANDOLP. - .

War I detert: but war with foreign foes, '" '
Whose manners, language, and whose looks are firange,
Is not so horrid, nor to me so hateful,
As that wihich with our neighbours oft we wage.
A river here, there an ideal line,.
By fancy drawn, divides the 'ifted kingdoms.
On each fide dwells apeople similar,.
As twins are to each other; valiant both;
Both for their-valour famous thro' the world.
-Yet will they not unite their kindred arms,
And, if they mufl have-war, wage distant war,
But with each other fightin cruel conflct
Gallant in firife, and noble in their ire,
The batte is theirpaflime. They go forth
Gay in the'morning, as tofummerfport;
When ev'ning comes, the glory ofthe-morn,
The youthful.warrior is-a clodof clay.. .
Thus fall the primeof either hapless land;
And such the fruit of Scotch and English wars -.

Lord RANDaLPH,.

I'll hear no.more: this melody would make -
A soldier drop his sword, and doff his arms,
Sit down and weep the conquefls he has made;
Yea, (like a monk), sing ref and peace in heav'n:

Of my misfortunes. Ruling fate decree'1,
That my brave brother should in battle save
The life of DOUGLAs' son, our house's foe:
The youthful warriors vow'd eternal friendship.
To fee the vaunted fiterof his friend-
Impatient, Don GLAS to Balarmo came,
Under a borrow'd name -- My heart he galn'd;
Nor did I long refuse the hand he begg'd:
My brother's pretence authoris'd our marriage.
Three weeks, three little'weeks, with wings of down,
Had o'er us flown, when'my lov'd Lord was call'd
To fight his father's battles; and'with him,
In spite ofall my tears, did MALCOLM go.
Scarce were they gone, when my fern Sire was told
That the false firanger was Lord DOU GLAS' son.
Frantic with rage, the Baron drew his sword,
And qdefion'd me. Alone, forsaken, faint,
Kneeling beneath his sword, fault'ring I took
An oath equivocal, that I ne'er wwould
WedoneofDouGLAs' nanme. Sincerity,
Thou firfi of virtues; let'no mortal leave
Thy onward path ' altho' the earth ilould gape,
And from the gulph of hell detrultion cry
To take dissimulation's winding way.

Is eafiet to avow. This moral learn,
This precious moral, from my tragic tale,---
In a few days the dreadful tidings came
That DoUGLAS and my brother both were lain.

What had Idone to meritfich affli&ion ?

A tale 6o fad as this.

Ofmy dilfracting grief, I found inyfelf - .
As women wiih to be who love their Lords.
Butwho durst tell my father ? The good prielt
Who join'd our hands, my brother's antient tutor,
With hislov'd MALCOLM, in the battle fell
They two alone were privy to the marriage.
On silence and concealment I refolv'd,-
Till time /hould make my father's fortune mine.
That very night on which my son was born,
My nurse, the only confident I had,
Set out with him to reach her filler's house:
But nurse, nor infant, have I everfeen

Is doubly irkfomie in an hour like this.

ANNA.
Why speaks my Lady thus of RANDOLPH'S heir?

Lady RANDOLPH.

Because he's not the heir of RANDOLPH'S virtues.
Subtle ahdfhrewd, he offers to mankind
An artificial'image of hiifclf:
And he with ease can vaiy to the tate

Of

Ofdifferent men, its .features. Self-deny'd,,
And naiter of his appetites he seems-:
But his fierce nature, like a fox chain'd up,
Watches to seize unseen the wifh'd-for prey.
Never were vice and virtue pois'd so ill,
As in GLENAL VON'S unrelenting mind.
Yet is he brave and politic in war,-
And itands aloft in there unruly times.
Why I describe him thus I'll tell hereafter:
Stay and detain him till I reach the cafle. -

A band of fierce Barbarians, from the hills,
Rufh'd like a torrent down upon the vale,
Sweeping our flocks and herds. The ihepherds fled
For safety and for succour. I alone,
With bended bow, and quiver full of arrows,
Hover'dabout the enemy, and mark'd.
The road he took, then halted to my friends;
Whom, with a troop of fifty chosen men,
I met advancing. The pursuit I led,
Till we o'ertook the fpoil-encumber'd foe -.
We fought and conquer'd. E're a sword was drawn,
An arrow from my bow had pierc'd their chief,
Who wore that day the arms which now I wear.

Returning

Returning home in triumph, I difdain'd
The Ihepherd's slothful life: and having heard '
That our good King had-fummion'd his bold Peers
To lead their warriors to the Carron'lide, .
I left my father's house, and took with me
A chosen servant to condut my fieps;-
Yon trembling coward who forsook his mailer;..
Journeying with thisjntent, I pall these towers,.
And, heaven-direted, came this day to do
The happy deed that gilds my humble name. '

Lord RANDOLPH.

He is as wife as brave. Was ever tale
With such a gallant modefly rehears'd:?
My brave deliverer! thou'lhalt enter now
A nobler lift, and in a monarch's fight
Contend with princes for the prize of fame;
I will present thee to our Scottiih King,
Whose valiant spirit ever valour iov'd.
Ha! my MATILDA! wherefore.fiar'ts that tear?

Lady RANDOLPH;

I cannot fay: for various affetions,
And fIrangely mingled, in my bosom fivell; :-
Yet each of them may well command a tear. - . . '-
I joy that thou art safe, and I admire . .
Him and his fortunes who hath' wrought thy safety;.
Yea, as my mind predits, with thine-his own; -
Obscure and friendless, he the army fought, :
Bent upon peril, in the range of death - - .... .
Refolv'd-to hunt for fame, and with his f/{ord :. . .

C To

To gain diutinction which his birth deny'd.
In this attempt unknown he might have perim'd,
And gain'd, with all his valour, but oblivion.
Now grac'd by thee, his virtue serves no more
Beneath despair. The soldier now of hope
He flands conspicuous; fame and great renown
Are brought within the compass of his fivord.
On this m mind refleted, whilt you spoke,
And bgefs'd the wonder-working Lord of heaven.

Lord RANDOLPH.

Pious and grateful ever are thy thoughts!
My deeds shall follow where thou point's the way.
Next to myself, and equal to GLENALVON,
In honour and command iall NORVAL be:

NORVAL.

I know not how to thank you. Rude I am
In speech and manners: never till this hour
Stood I in such a presence: yet, my Lord,
There's Something in my breast which makes me bold
To fay, that NORVAL ne'er will ihame thy favour.

Lady RANDOLPH.

I will be sorn thou wilt not. Thou shalt be
My knight; and ever, as thou didft to-day,
With happy valour guard the life of RANDOLPH.

Lord RANDOLPH.

Well haft thou spoke. Let meforbid reply. [ToNoRvA L.
We are thy debtors still; thy high desert
O'ertops our gratitude. I must proceed,
As was at firlf intended, to the camp.

Some

Some of my train, I fee, are speeding hither,'
Impatient, doubtless, of their Lord's delay.
Go with me, NORVAL, and thine eyes lhall fee
The chosen warriors of thy native land,
Who languilh for the fight, and beat the air
With brandifh'd swords.

NORVAL.

Let us be gone, my Lord.
Lord RANDOLPH.

[To Lady RANDOLPi.

About the time that the declining fun
Shall his broad orbit o'er yon hills suspend,
Expec us to return. This night once more
Within these walls I reft; my tent I pitch
To-morrow in the field. Prepare the. feast.
Free is his heart who for his country fights:
He in the eve of battle may resign
Himself to social pleasure; sweetest then,
When danger to a soldier's foul endears
The human joy that never may return.

Exeunt RANDOLPH and NORVAL.
Lady RANDOLPH and ANNA.

Lady RANDOLPH.

His parting words have struck a fatal truth;
0 DOUGLAS! DOUGLAS! tenderwas:thetime
When we two parted,. ne'er to meet again-!
How many years ofanguiif and despair

C 2 Ha,

Has heav'n annex'd to those fiviftpaffing hours;
Of love and fondness ! Then my bosom's flame
Oft, as blown back by the.rude breath of fear,
Return'd, and with redoubled ardour blaz'd.

ANNA.

May gracious heav'n pour the sweet balm of peace
Into the wounds that fefer in your breat !
For earthly consolation cannot cure them.

Lady RANDOLIH.

One only cure can heav'n itfelfbeftow;-
A grave-that bed in which the weary reft.
Wretch that I am! Alas ! why am 1 so ?
At every happy parent I repine !
How blest the mother of yon gallant NORVA L !
She for a living husband bore her pains,
And heard him bless her when a man was born:
She nurs'd her smiling infant on her breaf;
Tended the child, and rear'd the pleasing boy:
She, with affection's triumph, saw the youth
In grace and comeliness surpass his peers:
Whilfi I to a dead husband bore a son,
And to the roaring waters gave my child.

.-* ' ANNA.-

Alas! alas ! why will you thus resume
Your grief afresh ? I thought that gallant youth
Would for a while have won you from your woe.
On him intent ynu gazed, with a look
Much more delighted, than your pensive eye
Has deign'd on other objects to bestow.

Lady

Lady RANDOLPIH.

Delighted, fay'it thou? Oh! even there mine eye
Found fuel for my life-confuminig sorrow.
I thought, that, had the son of DOUGLAS liv'd,
He might have been like this young gallant firanger,
And pair'd with him in features and in shape; \
In all endowments, as in years, I deem,
My boywith blooming NoRVA L might have numbe'd.
Whilst thus I mus'd, a spark from fancy fell
On my fad heart, and kindled up a fondness
For this young stranger, wand'ring from his home,
And like an orphan cast upon my care.
Iwill protet thee (said I to myself)
With all my power, and grace with all my favour.

ANNA.

Sure heav'n will bless so generous a resolve.
You mull, my noble Dame, exert your power:
You must awake.: devices will be fram'd;.
And arrows pointed: at the breat of'NoRVAiL.

Lady RANDOLPH.

GLENALVON'S false and crafty head will work
Against a rival in his kinsman's love,
If I deter him not: I only cain.
Bold as he is, GLE-ALV ON will beware
How he pulls down the fabric that I raise.
I'll be the artist of young NoRmAL's fortune.
'Tis pleasing to admire! most apt was I
To this affetion in my better days;
Tho' now I seem to you shrunk up, retir'd

C 3 Withiri

Within the narrow compass of my woe.
Have you not sometimes seen an early flower
Open its bud, and spread its silken leaves,
To catch fiveet airs, and odours to bellow;
Then, by the keen blat nipt, pull in its leaves,
'And,.tho' till living, die to scent and beauty!
Emb!em of me: affliidn, like a florm,
Halu kill'd the forward bloffomof my heart.

I have: and that the villains may not 'scape,
With a itrong band I have begirt the' wood.
If they.lurk there, alive:they lhall be taken,
And torture force from them th' important secret,
Whether some foe of-RAZDOLPH bhir'd their swords,

That care becomes a kinfinan's love.
I have a counsel for GLENALVON'S ear. [Exit ANRA.

I have not found so: thou art known to me.

And miof certain is mycaufe ofknowledge.

GLENALVON.

What do you know ? By the m6ob blessed cross,
You much amaze me. No created being,
Yourself except, durit thus accost GLENALVON.

Lady RANDOLPH.

Is guilt so bold! and dost thou make a merit
Of thiy pretended meekness! This to me,
Who, with a gentleness which duty blames,
Have hitherto conceal'd what, if divulg'd,
Would make thee nothing or, what's worse than that,
Ahn outcast beggar, and unpitied too !
For mortals Shudder at a crime like thine.

GLENALVON.

Thy virtue awes me. First of womankind!
Permit me yet to fay, that the fond iman,
Whom love transports beyond ftriit vitiie's 'bbonds,
If he is brought by love to misery,
In fortune ruin'd, as in mind forlorn,
Unpitied cannot be. Pity's the alms
Which on such beggars freely isbeibw'd:
For mortals know that love is still their lord,
And o'er theirvain resolves advances still:
As fire, when kindled by our Ihepherds, moves
Thro' the dry heath against the fanning wind.

C 4 Lady

Lady RANDOLPH.

Reserve these accents for some other ear.
To love's apology I lifen not.
Mark thou my words; for it is meet thou ihould't. '
His brave deliverer RA NDOL PH here retains.
Perhaps his presence may not please thee well:
But, at thy peril, prafcife ought against him:
Let not thy jealousy attempt to shake
And loosen the good root he has in RANDOLPH ;
Whose favourites, I know, thou haft supplanted.
Thou look'it at me, as if thou fain would'lt pry
Into my heart. 'Tis open as my speech.
I give this early caution, and put on
The curb, before thy temper breaks away.
The friendless Stranger my protection claims:
His friend I am, and be not thou his foe. [Exit.

And be the diallow fool of coward conscience I
I am not what I have been; what I ihould be.

In holy legends, and religious tales,
I should conclude there was an arm above,
That fought againfl me, and malignant turn'd,
To catch myself, the subtle snare 1 set.
Why, rape and murder are not simple means!
Th'imperfec rape to RANDOLPH gave a fpo.fe;

A favourite to hide the fan from me;
And, wort of all, a rival. Burning hell '
This were thy centre, if I thought she lov'd him I
'Tis certain she contemns me; nay, commands me,,
And waves the flag of her displeasure o'er me,
In his behalf. And hall I thus be brav'd

More fierce than hate, ambition, and revenge,.

SOME eighteen years ago,'I rented land'

Of brave Sir MALCOLM, then BALARMO'S Lord;
But falling to decay, his servants seiz'd
All that I had, and then turn'd me.and mine-.
(Four helpless infants and-their weeping. mother)
Out to the mercy of the winter. winds..

A little:

A little hovel by the river's fide
Receiv'd us: there hardilabour, and the skill
In fishing, which was formerly my sport, - -
Supported life. Whilst thus we poorly liv'd,
One flormy night, as I remember well,
The wind and rain beat hard upon our roof:
Red came the river down, and loud and oft
The angry fpiiitof 'th water fhriek'd.
At the dead hour of night was heard the cry
Of one injeopardy. I rose, arid ran
To where the circling eddy of a pool,
Beneath the ford, us'd oft to bring within
My reach whatever floating thing the stream
Had caught. Thevoicewasceas'd; theperfon lot:
But looking fad and earnet on the waters,
By the moon's light I saw, whirld round and round,,
A basket: soon I drew it to the bank,'
And nestled curious there an infant lay.

Scorn is more grievous than the pains of death:
Reproach more piercing than the pointed sword.

Lady RANDOLPH.

I scorn thee mot, but'when I ought to scorn;
Nor e'er reproach, but when insulted virtue
Againf audacious vice aferts herself.
I own thy worth, GLENALVON ; none more apt
Than I to praise thine eminence in arms,
And be the echo of thy martial fame.
No longer vainly feed a guilty paflion:
Go and pursue a lawful mistress, glory.
Upon the Danili crefis redeem thy fault,
And let thy valour be the shield of RANDOLPH.

GLE.ALVON.

One inflant flay, and hear an alter'd man.
When beauty pleads for virtue, vice abafh'd
Flies its own colours, and goes o'er to virtue.
I am your convert ;time will ihew how truly;
Yet one immediate proof I mean to give.
That youth, for whom your ardent zeal to-day
Somewhat too haughtily defy'd your slave,
Amidc' the shock of armies I'll defend,

. And

And turn death;from hi,,wilth a guardian arm. -
Sedate by use, my-bofonm maddens not
At the tumultubus uproar of the field.

Lady .RANDOLPH.

At thus, GLEN ALVoON, anid-Iam thy friend:
But that's-thy leat reward. Bieieve m'e;, Sir,
The truly'generotus is the truly wvifie; '
And he who'loves not others, lives unblefs.

GLENALVON lo/ts.

Amen! and virtue is its own reward !-
I think that I have hit the very tone
In which the loves to speak. Honey'd assent,
I-owplcafant art thou to the taste of man,
And woman also !. flattery dire.t *."
Rarely difgufls. They little know mankind
Who doubt its operation: 'tis my key,
And opes the wicket of the human heart.
How far I have succeeded now I know not.'
Yet I incline to think her stormy virtue
Is lull'd a while: 'tis her alone 1 fear:
Whilit she and RANDOLPH live, and live in faith
And amity, uncertain is my tenure.
Fate o'er my head suspends disgrace and death,
By that weak hair, a peevish female's will.
I am'not idle': but the ebbs and flows
Of fortune's tide cannot be calculated.
That slave of NoRv L'S I have found moit apt:

D I hew'd

I ihew'd him gold, and he has pawn'd his foul
To fay and fivear whatever I suggest.
NORVAL, I'm told, has that alluring look,
'Twixt man and woman, which I have obferv'd
To charm the nicer and fantastic dames,
Who are, like:Lady RANDOLPH, full of virtue
In railing RANDOLPr.'s jealousy I may
iBut point him to the truth. lIe seldom errs
Who thinks the worst he can of womankind.

Lord RANDOLPH.
SUmmon an hundred horse, by break of day;

To wait our pleasure at the cattle-gate.

Enter Lady RANDOLPH.

Lady RANDOLPH.

Alas! my Lord 1 I've heard unwelcome news; -
The Danes are landed.

Lord RANDOLPH.

Ay, no inroad this

Of the Northumbrian bent-to take a spoil:
No sportive war, no tournament essay,
Of some young knight refolv'd to break a spear,
And tain with hostile blood his maiden arms.
TheDanes are landed: we mult beat them back,
Or live the slaves of Denmark.

Lady RANDOLPH.

Dreadful times!
D Lord

Lord RANDOLPH.

The fenceless villages are all forsaken;
The trembling mothers; and their children lodg'd
In wall-girt towers and castles; whilRf the men
Retire indignant. Yet, like broken waves,
They but retire more awful to return.

Lady RANDOLPH.
Immense, as fame reports, the Danish host---

. Lord RANDOLPH.

Were it as numerous as loud fame reports;
An army knit like ours would pierce it thro':
Brothers, that ihrink not from each other's fide,
And fond companion, fill our. warlike files:
For his dear offspring, and the wife he loves,
The husband; and the fearless father arm.
In vulgar breatts heroic ardor burns,
And the poor peasant mates his daring lord.

Lady RANDOL-PH.

Men's minds are temper'd,.like their swords, for war;
Lovers of danger, on deftruftion's brink
They joy to rear eret their daring forms.
Hence, early graves; -hence,.the lone widow's life;
And the fad mother's grief-embitter'd age.
Where is our gallant guet ?

Lord RANDOLPH.

Down in the vale

I left him, managing a fiery steed,
Whose tlubbornnefs had foil'd the strength and ikill

Of

Of every rider. But behold hecomes,
In earnest conversation with GLENALVON.

Enter NORVAL and GLENALVON.

GLENALVON! with thelark arise; go forth,
And lead my troops that lie in yonder vale:
Private I travel to the royal camp:
NoRvAL, thou goeft with me. But fay, young mari
Where didfl thou learn so to discourse of war,
And in such terms as I o'erheard to-day ?
War is no village science, nor its phrase
A larguage taught amongst the Ihepherd swains.

NORVAL.

Small is the ikill my Lord delights to praise
In him he favours.--- Hear from whence it came.
Beneath a mountain's brow, the most remote
And inaccessible by ihepherdstrod,
In a deep cave, dug by no mortal hand,
A hermit liv'd; a melancholy man,
Who was the wonder of our wand'ring swains.
Autlere and lonely, cruel to himifelf,
Did they report him; the cold earth his bed,
Water his drink, his food the thepherds' alms.
I went to fee him, and my heart was touch'd
With rev'rence and with pity. Mild he spake,
And, entringon discourse, such stories told
As made me oft revisit his fad cell.
For he had been. afoldier in his youth;

D 3, And

And fought in famous battles, when the Peers
Of Europe, by the bold GODFREDO led,
Against th' usurping Infidel difplay'd -
The cross of Christ, and won the Holy Land.
Pleas'd with my admiration, and the fire
His speech struck from me, the old man wou'd lhake
His years away, and act his young encounters:
Then, having shew'd his wounds, he'd fit him down,
And all the live-long day 'discourse of war.
To help my fancy, in the smooth green turf.
He cu: the figures of the marlhali'd holts;
Defcrib'd the motions, and explain'd the use
Of the deep column, and the lengthen'd line,
The square, the crescent, and the phalanx firm.,
For all that Saracen or Christian knew
Of war's valf art, was to this hermit known.

Lord RANDOLPH.

Why did this soldier in a defart hide
'hose qualities that should have grac'd a camp?

- NORVAL.

That too at lad I learn'd. Unhappy man!
Returning homewards by Messina's port,
Loaded with wealth and honours bravely won,
A rude and bofi'rous captain of tht sea
Faifen'd a quarrel on him. Fierce they fought;
The lranger fell, and with his dying breath
Declar'd his name and lineage ! Mighty God !
The soldier cried, my brother! Oh ! my brother!

Lady RANDOLPH.
His brother !

NORVAL.

NORVAL.

Yes; of the fame parents bor';

His only brother. They exchang'd forgiveness
And happy, in my mind, was he that died - .'
For many deaths has the survivor fufter'd,
In the wild defart on a rock he fits,
Or on some nameless stream's untrodden banks,
And ruminates all day his dreadful fate,
At times, alas ! not in his perfec mind !
Holds dialogues with his lov'd brother's ghost;
And oft each night forsakes his fulled couch,
To make fad orifons.for him he flew.

Lady RANDOLPH.

To what mylterious woes -are mortals born
In this dire tragedy were there no more
Unhappy persons ? did the parents live ?

NORV AL.

No; they were dead: kind heav'n had clos'd their eyes
Before their son had shed his brother's blood.

Lord RANDOLPH.

Hard is his fate; for he was not to blame !
There is a destiny in this frange world,
Which oft decrees an undeserved doom:

My Lord, requests are vain;

He urges on, impatient of delay,
Stung with the tidings of the foe's approach.

Lord RANDOLPH.

May vi&ory fit on the warrior's plume !
Bravest of men! his flocks and herds are safe;
Remote from war's alarms his pastures lie,
By mountains inacceflible fecur'd:
Yet foremost he into the plain descends,
Eager to bleed in battles not his own.
Such were the heroes of the antidnt world:
Contemners they of indolence and gain ;'
But fill f6r love of glory, and of arms,
Prone to encounter peril, and to lift
Against each strong antagonist the spear.
I'll go and press the heroto my breaf.

And, if I fall, with noble dust I lie.

From my own fate, her portion has been sorrow.

She lives; but wafies her life in constant woe,
Weeping her husband slain, her infant loft.

Bewail their destiny, now have compaflion
Upon the offspring of the friends you lov'd !

Opprefs'd by a base world, perhaps she bends
Beneath the weight of other ills than grief;
And, desolate, implores of heav'n' the aid

Arise, my son! In me thou dost behold
The poor remains of beauty once admir'd -
The autumn of my days is come already;.
For sorrow made my summer haste away.

Amongst the trees, I saw him glide along.

GLENALVON.-
Most true, my Lord.

Lord RANDOLPH.

Yet this diftinguifh'd Dame

Invites a youth, the acquaintance of a day,
Alone to meet her at the midnight hour.
This afignation, [.e.os a letter . the assassin freed,
Her manifelt aftieion for the youth,
Might breed suspicion in a husband's brain,
Whose gentle consort all for love had wedded;
Much more in mine. MATILDA never lov'd me.
Let no man, after me, a woman wed,.
Whose heart he knows he has not ; th' the brings
A mine of gold, a kingdom for her dowry,
For let her seem, like the night's shadowy queens..,
Cold and contemplative ;-He cannot trust her:
She may, she will, bring shame and sorrow on him;
The worlt of sorrows, and the worst of shames !

Yield not, my Lord, to such affliaing thoughts;
But let the spirit of an- husband sleep;
Till your own senses make a sure conclusion.
This billet mull to blooming No RVAL' go:

t the next turn awaits my truity spy;
I'11 give it him refitted for his mailer.

Of their behaviour.

Permit me now to make o'ne flight eflay.
Of all the trophies which vain mortals boast,
By wit, by valour, or by wisdom won,
The firit and fairest, in a young man's eye,
Is woman's captive heart. Successful love
With glorious fimes intoxicates the mind ! '
And the proud conqueror in triumph moves
Air-born, exalted above vulgar men.

Lord RANDOLPH.
And what avails this maxim

GLENALVON.

Much, my Lord !

Withdraw a little: I'll accost young No RVAL,
And with ironical derisive counsel
Explore his spirit. If he is no more
Than humble NORVAL, by thy favour rais'd,

Brave

Brave as he is, he'll shrink aftonifh'd from me:
But if he be the fa'rite of the fair,
Lov'd by the i.rn of Caledonia's dames, .
He'll turn upon me, as thelion turns .
Upon the hunter's ipear.

'Tis firange, by heav'n!

That she should run full tilt her fond career,

Whose charity exceeds not. Precious sex !

To chide the thunder, if at him it roar'd.

With yellow radiance lighten'd all the vale, .

And as the warriors mov'd, each polilh'd helm, .
Corllet, or spear, glanc'd back his gilded beams.;
The hill they climb'd, and halting at its top,

Of more than mortal size, tow'ring, they feem'd,
An host angelic, clad in burning arms.

GLENALVON.

Thou talk'ft it well; no leader of our host,
In founds more lofty, speaks of glorious war.

NORVAL.

If I (hall e'er acquire a leader's name,
My speech will be less ardent. Novelty
Now prompts my tongue, and youthful admiration
Vents itfelffreely; since no part is mine
Of praise pertaining to the great in arms.

GLENALVON.

You wrong yourself, brave Sir; your martial deeds.
Haverank'd youwith thegreat: butmark me,NoRvAL;
Lord RANDOLPH'S favour now exalts your youth
Above his veterans of famous service.
Let me, who know the soldiers, counsel you.
Give them all honour; seem not to command:
Else thy will scarcely brook your late sprung power,
Which nor alliance props, nor birth adorns.

NORVAL.

Sir, I have been accuftom'd all my days
To hear and speak the plain and imple truth:
And tho' I have been told, that there are men
Who borrow friendfiip's tongue to speak their scorn,
Yet in such language I am little fkill'd.
Therefore I thank GLENALVON for his counsel,
Altho' it founded harlhly. Why remind

Me

Me of my birth obscure ? Why slur my power
With such contemptuous terms ?

How sweet and solemn is this mid-night scene !
The silver moon, unclouded, holds her way
Thro' skies where I could count each little star.

The river, ruflhing o'er its pebbled bed,

And told the secrets of the world unknown.

Although he should, the toils of. fate surround him,
Dauntless and firm our brave associates stand,
And with impatience wait the deftin'd hour
To rulh on AGIS. This unlook'd for battle
Is but a solemn prelude to the at,
Which bold conspiracy will soon perform.
This day shall terminate the reign of AGIs,
And make, O Queen ! all power in Sparta thine.

I fee that danger only whets the brave.
But yet, AMPHARES, ifmy lord is vanquifh'd,
Will not theconquering army awe the city ?

My motive in attending here your presence
Merits a less injurious salutation.

AGIS.

I know thy merits, and I will reward them.
Art thou not author of the woes of Sparta,
Prime mover and inflamer of sedition
Haft thou not bent the power of thy high office
To the subversion of the date thou ferv'f ?
At thee this day my indignation burns.
I am difhonour'd- -

AMPHARES.
What has dilhonour'd thee ?

Acis.

Thou and thy pratices: They have compell'd me
To leave the noblest fiation of a prince.
In time of war where should a king be found
But at his army's head ? There AGIS stood,
When you and your presumptuous Ephori
Requir'd my presence here. Ungrateful Spartans !
Had you allow'd me but one other day,

F 2 Thea

Then had I fought this battle for my country,
And died or conquer'd with her bravest sons.

AGESISTRATA.

Peril, my son ! dwells not in camps alone: t
In cities, palaces, and courts ofjuftice,
With treachery and treason he. inhabits.
Peril attended thus thou must encounter,
More hideous sure than in the ranks of war.

AMPHARES.

I know my actions have incens'd the king.
But Iimagin'd not that such suspicions
Found entertainment in your royal breafis.

Haft thou not join'd the enemies of AG s ?
Thou who waft once his friend, inconstant man.

AMPHARES.

I have oppos'd the counsel of a foe;
Whose arts depriv'd me of my prince's favour.

AGIS.

Thou haft oppos'd LYCURGUS and the laws,
Which rais'd the name of Sparta to the ikies.
The Delphic God infpir'd the deep design:
For more than human was that power of thought
Which join'd the public to the private good,
With such perfection, that each selfish passion
Flow'd in the channel of the common welfare,
And, like one family of sons and fires,
And dearef brothers, a great people liv'd;
In peace they liv'd without or' rife or scorn,

p .d, In

In war they fought to conquer, or to die.
Equaland free, our happy fathers knew
No interef but the interest of the state;
No gain but Sparta's glory; proud they bore
That palm aloft, and shar'd the high refpe&,
The admiration, which consenting Greece
Paid to th' imperial virtue of their country.

AMPHARES.

Revolving time that system overthrew,
And chang'd the manners and the laws. of Sparta.

AGIs.

Tile laws have been neglected, not annull'd,
And cdrrupt rulers have corrupted manners.
Authority will loon revive the laws,
And great example yet restore the manners,
Infpite ofthofe who have opprefs'd their country,
Depriv'd the people of their antient rights, -
And, while the nation funk beneath their sway,
Still drove for power in a declining kingdom,.
Still fought for wealth in an impoverifh'd land.
Even at this hour rapacious they persist,
And, like some wretches in a stranded veflel,
Plunder and riot in the midst of ruin.

AMPHARES.

This signal hour I chore, unknown as yet
The fortune of the field, to change my condut,

The old dependants of the exil'd king,
And all the venal members of the itate,
Won by SANDANE'S arts and foreign gold,
Aim to reflore LEONIDAS, who comes
With hostile armies to'enflave his country:
Therefore SANDA N E'S proffers I rejeced,
Have warn'd the king, and would have serv'd hiimtco
. But since refeintment and distrust prevent me, a

Neutral I stand; and will not seek that welcome
Which his more artful enemies'would give.

AGIs.

Thoufpeak'lt more boldly than becomes AMPHAR ES.
Add that to the offences I forgive.
It is the sacred maxim of my reign,
That in a prince's consecrated breast
Revenge and anger ihould not long remain.
There passions in a king afflia the state,
By driving ra(h offenders to despair.
This day decides your character with me.
Now let your ations prove your words sincere.

For Sparta's sons, would brave the bolt of Jove.

Tell me what brought the great LYSANDER hither ?
Some firatagem profound; which none but he
Could have contriv'd to haften his deftrudion,
And add disgrace and ridicule.to ruin.

LYSANDER.

Had'st thou not fled, thou coward, from my sword,;
And lhriek'd for help, this arm, this single arm,
Had baffled all the craft of false AMPHARES.

AMPHARES.
' ThiL pride becomes thee, and thy lot condition,

flsould have pitied him.

AMPHARES.

LYSANDER.

For none that thou canst give. Hear me, thenjudge,
If what I speak is meant to win thy favour.
Ilhould have pitied thee by fate subdued:

Opprelt

Oppreft with crimes, thy fpirit.would have Ihrunk
Under calamity, and guilt have marr'd
The noble vigor and the port of manhood.
Amidit thy triumph, does it not confound thee,
To think thou ow't it to excess of bafenes ?
Thou haft prevail'd, because the generous AcGI
Would not believe there could be such a traitor.

AMPHARES.

Oft have I heard, and often seen thy'folly;
But now to rail is madness. With one word
I could impose on thee eternal silence.

LYSANDER.

And would-I know thee-if thou thought'l it wife
Even then, as now, I' hould contemn thy power:
But know, I fear thee not. The kingis safe,
And his victorious troops at break of day ',
Will thunder in thine ears: thou and thy baand
Will ill fuflain the shock of such an hofR.
My life is in thy hands, but yet berate,
Thy fate depends on.mine. In Lacedaemon
A prince like Acis soon will find LYSANDEA .

But I will speak, and. earth and heaven {hall hear me;
AMPHARES too shall hear; for it will-gall him
To hear EUANTHE now avow her love
And faith toher LYSANDER. Powerful words,
Emblems and figures of firm conflancy,
Such as fond lovers lavi fhly employ
To sooth the pangs of parting and of abSence.
Such music vows accord not with our fate,
Our dreadful state: yet do not grieve Thy heart,
Thynoble heart, too fall-ofother sorrows,
With thoughts of what may-happen to EUANTHE.
Nothing (hall happen to debate EUANTHE.
The bondage and the shame that women susser,
Who live the slaves of those who flew their lords,
I ne'er lhall know, I never will endure.
If cruel destiny decrees thy fall,
Unspotted to the shades I'll follow thee,
For whom alone on earth I'd wish to live.

LYSANDER.

That secret.in your bread and his is lodg'd:

In early youth he left his -native land;

In many a hard campaign, have chas'd his bloom. ;

All necessary dangers must be rifk'd.
Perhaps I am the fubje&dof their councils,
Perhaps I may be call'd before the ,senate!
If I appear not, you must be difcover'd,
And my escape too soon to them be known.

Euxus.

Your reasons are of force. I am convinicd.
Here, take my fivord. Then, if we are betray'd,
My troops obey you. Now, my bold SITHONTES,

And guard the person of this Spartan chief
Asyou would guard myself. IfI'm detain'd,

Of great exploits by ardent valour done:

The strong reality of such a storm.

Enter a Spartan, AGIS following,

AGIS.

This way condufts iot to AniycIa's gate.
Ah ! whither dost thou lead me?

AMPHARES.

To thy death.
The Ephori of Sparta have condemn'd thee.

AGIS.

I am betray'd ! What mockery is this
Of sacred juitice ? Lay aside the robes

And

And ensigns of authority prophan'd
The pomp of magifiracy suits not treason.

AMPHAR.ES.

The licence of thy tongue affronts the laws,
Where awful rev'rence our high office bears.

AcIs.

Know ye not this, ye guardians of the laws,
The meanefi citizen of Lacedaemon.
Without free trial cannot be condemn'd;
Much less your king. 'What law have I tranfgrefs'd i
Point out my crime; produce my bold accusers,

AMPHARES.
Thy crime is tyranny.

*AGIS.
Is that my crime ?

Had Acs-.been a tyrant, thou had'st been
His fawning slave, thou enemy of freedom.

AMPHAR'ES.

Behold the ftubborn'fpirit of this man:
He breathes his native arrogance, and till
Insults his judges, and avows his crimes.

AGIS.-

Who made you judges of the life of AGIS ?
Butyouhave judg'd. yourselves, and earth, and heaven,
Know how unjustly. To the Gods above,
The sure avengers of a murder'd king, ,
I make my lat appeal. Their messenger
Ison the wing; LYSANDER comes apace;
AndNEMESIS direas his righteous sword.

AMPHARES.

AMPHARES.

Proceeds this boldness from thy trust in him?
Thy great avenger is, like thee, a captive, '
And under the-fane mortal sentence lies.

Ye powers above! LYSANDER too a captive!
Where was he taker ?

AMPlHARES.

In the fireets of Sparta,
Clad in the servile garment of a Helot.

AGIS. Â·: .

Alas! alas! LYSANDER I 0 my friend!
Thy love for me, thy generous, fearless love,
Has wrought thy fall. - For me thou cam'l to Sparta
And, like the parent bird hov'ring too near

Forgive these tears, my country! Ac is weeps
For thee. Alas! thy brave defender's gone!
O Lacedaemon, thou art fallen for ever! '
Thy bad efate.Ihall every day grow worse;-
Succeflive tyrants lhall exhaust thy strength,
Till all thy generous youths have bled in vain;
At last the consummation of thy woes
Shall come upon thee; some ambitious foe
Shall itretch the iron arm of conqueRs forth,
And grasp thee in the circle of his empire.
My native land, the kingdom of my fathers,
Shall be no more a nation ! O my country,
How irretrievable is thy condition !

The

The Macedonian vulture hovers o'er thee,
Soon todefcend, and on thy vitals prey.

AMPHARES.

Thoumay'it delay, perhaps avoid, thy death.
Send forth thy mandate to the royal band,
To halt till further orders.

Ac is.

Ha! No more

Itrufl thee, traitor. Would I had ever been
' hus deaf to thee ! No, let the royal band
Revenge their gallant leader and'their king.

Thou tempt't thy fate.

AGIS.

I scorn it. Since my hope

'Of Sparta's loft, and my beloved friend
Hasperifh'd in my cause, why should I live?
In any period of my former days
I rather would have chore to die attempting
The glorious design, which you have ruin'd,
Than live the prince of a degenerate people,
The tame fpeEator of a falling empire.

Firit EPHORE.
To Reason hearken.

Ac is.

Reason bids me die,

As I have liv'd, unalter'd in my love
To Sparta, and unconquer'd in my purpose.
You mean to, take advantage of my Rate,

Without

Without spectator, counsellor, or friend:
You think I dread the fern approach of.death;,
Because the blooming season of my life
Still promises a long extent of years:
But my forefathers blood is in my veins,
The blood of heroes, and of Spartan kings,
Less only than the Gods. I dare your wori,
And with my dying breath acquitmy people.
The people rose; they'hearken'd to the voice
Of Liberty, and blest the name. of AG s.
But you, the nobles, an inglorious race,
Base as the dastard and unarmed Helots,
With foreign arms ard mercenary aid,
Bore down the people and oppreit your prince,
Whom death delivers. AGIS shall not fee
The last convulsions of expiring Freedom.
For in the first he dies.

THE
Siege of AQUILEIA:

A
TRAGEDY.

ACT I;

T'e Patace Coitrt.
Enter PAULUS and TITUS.

PAULUS.

H I S. is no time to firive for vain renowni
The fate of Rome, remember that, my brother!
Depends on the defence of Aquileia.

TITUS.
PAULUS, I know.

P-AULUS.
But thou dost not confider
Th'importance of this war. We fight not now,.

As.

As oft since Freedom fell our fathers fought,
When Latian chiefs contended who Ihould reign,
With half the senate lifted on each fide;
The vitor still was Roman, and. rever'd
The gods and temples of immortal Rome.
But o'er yon mighty host that guards our walls,
Fierce MAXIMIN commands; whether of Thrace,
Or wild Dalmatia, so obscure his birth,
Himself scarce knows; but sure Barbarian born.
This savage soldier, nurs'd in blood and war,,'
Whom military frenzy hath set.up
*To trampleon mankind, abhors a Roman;
And marks for death the noble and the brave.
His yoke, at lat, th' indignant senate scorns,
The flumb'ring Genius of our country wakes,
And rouses slothful Italy to arms.
The furious tyrant from the frontier haftes,
Like a wild beast gall'd by the hunter's spear,
And, breathing vengeance, rushes upon Rome:
Here first oppos'd, tenfold his fiury burns;
Here, in the pass of fate, our father sands,
Defies and flops the monster in his rage,
Till Rome's last legions come to give him battle.
Now, when a soldier's life is of such moment,
When deltiny hangs on a tingle day,
To fight for glory, TITUs, were a crime,

TITUS.

No,PAULUs, no it is not fame alone
That TITUS seeks to purchase from, the foe; Th

Iw

'ho' such a crime the gods-and men would-pardon,
I know the peril that o'er Rome impends, \
And know the hated cause of all our ills,
That army, only brave againif their country, - -
I mean to smite them, and their giant leader,
Whom nature for a gladiator form'd,
To be the sport, and not the lord, of Rome.
Theblow'once struck, our foe mufl raise the siege,
Or wake his veterans in vain attacks,
And give to .GORDIANUS easy conqcuet.

PAULUS.

Were this a frontier city far from Romet
And yon huge host compos'd of foes remote,
German, or Parthian; I would fay to thee,
Lead on, my brother! Shield to, ihield we'd go,
And fire yon turret, or together perish.
But now when conquest by delay is gain'd,
When Aquileia guards the walls of Rome,
Dread of the great event has 'o possess'd me,
That,.like the Persian soldier, I could flay
My arm uplifted, patient to the call
Of cautious Duty.

TITUS.
And renouncing Fame ?

Oh! PAULUS ! you have gain'd long since the prize
That I contend for. Every martial palm
Thy fivord hath won. When I, like thee, am great
In deeds of arms, like thee 1 may be wary.
Now to my brother 1 lay bare- my breast:

This

This famous siege approaches to its end;
Whatever end the ruling gods ordain,-
Yet no diftinguifh'd ation graces me.
I've done my duty. That I reckon nothing;
The meanest soldier has not shrunk from duty;
Son of ,EMILI us, and thy brother,. PAULus
I mud do more, and by the gods I will!
Here I have found a path that leads to glory;
Do not oppose me, elfe-we're friends no more.-
Our father comes. Speak not againt my purpose,
And I ihall move the consul's noble mind.

Enter .EMILIUS.

. MILIUS.
Health to my sons I

PAUL.US andTIT's.

Heaven guard our fither's life!
.EMILIUS.. "

And bless my children! ha! your looks:are keen.
Your's chiefly, T Tus ! what, hath irr'd your iirit?
How points the enemy? This q.uiet night,.
In preparation patl, portends a storm.

PAULUS.

On that attack which threats the eastern gate
The enemy hath labour'd all night long,
Repairing what the river's rage had ruin'd.

JEMILIUS.

It was a friendly flood. The river god
Wiith.all his waters guards his native walls;.

On that frong quarter they can ne'er prevail.
The north I fear, where yon flupendous tower
Our works commands.

TITUS.

It thall not long command,
Let bat the consul grant me my desire.

2EMILI US.
What would my son ?

TITUS.
Their tower is weakly guarded.

At break of day, a soldier from yon camp
Fled to my poll; hollow and gaunt he was;
His flirivell'd limbs scarce bore his founding arms.
:Like him, he said, with toil and famine worn,
Were half the tyrant's hot. For MAXIMIN,,
Mad with delay, and fiercer from repulse,
Revileshis soldiers, drives them to the trench
With whips and (harp reproach. This day, o'ercome
By strong neceflity, he breathes a while,
And fends his legions forth, to gather in
Whatever this exhaufed region yields.
I saw the busy foragers in troops
March, and disperse themselves on every fide,
Likeplayful children on a summer day,
Secure and careless; for no martial band
Of late hath sallied from our guarded gates.
This is the time. Permit me, 0 my father!
Now to attack their ill defended lines,
And fire that mighty tower in which they trust.

7 .iEAr-

AEMILIUS.

Well haft thou spoke, my son ! thy zeal J love,
Nor mufl thy itill and judgment pass unprais'd. Â·
Be thus attentive Rtill, and tfuft me, TITUS,
In future sieges, and in other wars,
Swift execution Thall thy purpose honour.

TITUS.'

Ne'er shall I fee another siege like this,
Ne'er draw my sword in such a glorious cause.
Alas! my lord! check not my spring of thought,
Nor nip the only bud it yet has borne.

irMILIVS. '

Riper occasions will thy valour claim...
Danger comes on; Typhweus-Iike it comes,
Whose fabled flature every hour encreas'd.

TITUS.

0 ! judge not of the counsel by the weight
Of him that gives it. Would to heaven, mylord!
That I could now divest me of that youth
Which mars my credit. Chearfully I'd ftep
Far into age, to gain hut for a day
The grave authority-which years bellow.

PAULUS.,
What brings'the brave Numidian GARTHA hither? i

Enter GART9HA.

GARTHA. .
Hail to the general-

EMILIUS.
Hail, valiant GARTHA !
How has the morning pat where you command?

GA.RTHA.

It hasbeenbufy. The presumptuous foe
Inlocfe diforder'd squadrons rang'd the fields.
Iwatch'd the time; and iudden as the blaf
That rifes in the defart, out we rufl'd
And swept them from the plain. Safe in our speed
Wle urg'd the chace'far as the riling ground,
And unmolested view'd the camp below.
This worthy of your notice I obferv'd,
Their wond'rous tower, the work of many a day,-
Stands now protected by a feeble guard.

TInTus.

Thanks fdr thy welcome tidings, noble GARTHA !
The guardian gods of Rome bend from their skies,
And point this action out. Hear me, my father!
If ever since my birth I gave thee joy,
If e'er thou did'ft, as parents oft are wont,
Interpret large the promise of my childhood,
Oh'ear and grant my chief and dear request !
Letme go forth: be this my firil exploit,
To wrap in fire the tyrant's boasted tower;
That Rome, who glories in the .Emilian line,
Mayjoin your TITUS to his kindred names!

./EMILIUS.

In thee the spirit of thy fathers speaks,
Or some superior power thy bosom fires,

Whom

Whom I oppose no more. Go, and fulfil
Thy destiny. Brave GA R THA too hall add
His troops to thine. Prepare what else--- -

, T'TITUs.

'Tis done.

DefRruaive intruments and balls.of fire
Are ready at the gate.

JEMILIVs.

Farewel, myr son!

If you prevail, urge not too far your fortune.
Remember fRill my words; that when we meet,
I may have cause to praise thy condut then,
As now thy courage, TITUS.

TITUS.

GARTHA, come!

[Exeunt TITUS and GARTHA,

.EMILIUS.

PAULUs, lead thou thy legion to the gate,
And favour their retreat. It may be needful;
But mix not in the fight; for mighty cities
Have been by such temerity furpriz'd.

PAULUS.

Would that there was no Roman breast more prone
To rash attempts, than mine ! I wiih, my lord,
That I had led, and TITUS had fuftain'd me.

Enter an OFFICER.

And as it bears your name, myself have brought it.

Gladly, my lord. Much have the troops endur'd,
And with unihaken conlancy they susser.

Exit OFF-ICEl .

PAULUS.

Had this advice arriv'd ere TITUS went,
I think he hardly had obtain'd perniflion.
Tho' MAXIMIN thould raile an hundred towvers,
For three short days his fury we may corn,.

JEMILIUs.

Go, and prevent the sally. Tell thy brother,
What the imperial mandate here contains"
Itis the emperor's command recalls him.

With pleasure I obey.

[Exit PAULUS$ ..

And. in the battle aid the Roman arms.
The hour approaches, that mull give to Rome
A legal lord, by her own suffrage chosen,
Or fix a barb'rous mailer o'er mankind.
That barb'rous malfer 1 ihall never own.
If I could sloop to drag the servile chain,
And leave the vassal of a vile Dalmatian,
Yet I could not conceal me in the croud
Ofprofrate Romans; I that flood aloft,
And bore thro' Italy the senate's standard.
Fait by that standard will I plant my foot,
There with my boys a glorious conquest gain,
Or end at once the long JEmilian line.

Behold the only moment that can fliake:
One moment my refolvc! What will become
Of thee, CORNELIA ! doom'd perhaps to live,
Like PRIAM'S wretched queen, the slave of those
By whom her sons, her husband, country fell.

From the northern gate.

TITUS had form'd a brave, a great design;
But when assurance of relief arriv'd,
My PAULUS hallen'd to recal his brother.

- CORNELIA.

Tisaslfear'd. PAULUS will come too late.
The omens of the gods must be fulfill'd.

jEM ILIUS.

CORNELIA.

About that hour when glad Aurora springs,
To chace the lagging (hades, methought I was
loRome, and full of peace the city feem'd.
hMymind oblivious too had loft its care.
Srene I ftep'd along the lofty hall,
Embellilh'd with the statues of our fathers,
When suddenly an universal groan
liued at once from every marble breast.
Agha I gaz'd around ! when slowly down
From their high pedestals I saw descend
Themurder'd GR ACCH . Hand in hand, the brothers
Stlk'd towards me. 'As they approach'd more near,
Theywere no more the GRA CCHI,' but my sons

K.z2 PAULUS

PAULUS and TITus. At that dreadful change
I fhriek'dand wak'd. But never from my mind
Thefpetacle hall part. Their rueful eyes!
Their cheeks of lone! the look of death and woe!
So strange a vision ne'er from fancy rose.
The reft, my lord! this holy Priest can tell.

3EMILIUS.

Why this is nothing but a common dream;
For often when the waking mind'is charg'd '
With apprehension of uncertain ills,
Imagination, in the hour of reft,
Prefenteth wild fantaf-ic combinations,
That have a shade and tinxture ofthe.paRt:
But 'tis the weakneifsof the humaq mind
That joins the vain affemlage t9 futurit.

PRI EST.

Men reason thus, my lord ! who think their reason
Can grasp and measure all; presumptuous thought!
Sounds more than human hayvebeen often heard,
And shapes celestial seen, by mortal man;
But yet moit frequent. inthe silent night
Are warnings given'by strange portentuous dreams.
The history of mighty Rome abounds
In awful instances. The old republic
By them has oft been fway'd, and oft preferv'd,

JM.I I lUS.

But tell me, Priest of Joy E! what do the gods
By their more certain omens now dedlag

PRIrST.

PRIEST.

Consul! with the mos trvenerable rites
That our religion knows, I have perform'd
A sacrifice to Capitolian Jove,
This pious matron present: never yet
Since at the altars of the gods I flood
Did I behold such omens of calamity.
Yet they were intricate, ambiguous, dark;
And tho' some parts I might interpretfair,
Even these \vere mix'd and full of dire perplexity.
No further can I fee into the cloud,
That veils the will of heaven; but this I fay,
And by the fceptYe of the god .I serve
Itis the truth: Some dreadful danger hangs
O'er thee thyself, this city, or thy race.

An herald from the camp

Requires the tribune forthwith to return:
Impatient MAXIMIN stands on the plain,
Known by his purple and gigantick stature.

..CORNELIA.

Dreadful'impatience I most inhuman rage !
By the dear fynpathy of Roman blood,
Which in our veins from the fame fountain flows,
Let me entreat thee, VA RuS, to appease
The angry tyrart* pefe,...
Difpos'd to yield all that his honour can.
And if fern MAXIMIN prefersrevenge
To proser'd gold, yet try if wealth can win
His friends and favourites to be more gentle.

VARUS.

He has no friends nor favourites; from fear
His soldiers serve, his officers obey.
I muf be gone, for MAXIMIN brooks not
His orders flighted. Trust my zeal, CORNELIA !
Had I but equal power, your sons were free,
Consul.

Let me conduct thee to the gate,

And

And tell thee, as.we go, what yet'ytemains

-The Rosban host, by GORD IAiUS ied,
In three days hence reach Aquileia's walls;
Their near approach to MAXIMI* unknown.
Therefore the consul, without breach of honour,
Without injustice to the Roman fiate,
May stipulate with MAXIMIN, to yield
The city on the fourth returning day;
If not reliev'd. Ere that the chance of war
Raises the siege, or makes resistance vain.

C{ORNELIL.

CORNELIA.

Wife are thy words; and now the dawn of hope
Breaks on my darksome mind. Believe me, pries,
The los, of my dear sons in battle slain,
As once I thought them, was less terrible
Than the dire apprehension of that death
To which the tyrant dooms them; worse to me,
And worse, far worse to them. Alas! my sons!
Uncertain is your fate ! who can-foretel
The savage motions of the tyrant's will?
And yet this counsel seems the only means
Of preservation. Minister of heaven !
Let us retire, and at the altar bow
Of JovE eternal, who thy heart infpir'd.

To speak with calmness, I who serve him flill)
This day hath vow'd to raze imperial Rome.

EMILIUS.

VARIUS.
To fix his wavering hot,

To glut his legions with the mighty spoil.
Disease and famine prey upon his troops,
And rumour cries; that a relief is near.
The soldiers faint, and murmur at the length
And havock of this siege. The crafty tyrant
With found of trumpet thro' his camp proclaim'd,
Thathe will give the city to be sack'd,

Whose awful purposes, unconscious man

To fnite the proud usurper, and preserve
My children.

Tl Irs ! does TITUS come to plead-compaRfon?
Now, deftiriy, thou tramplet down JEMILIUs.
Go tell him, Herald, that I willnot fee him;
Let him not come to hear me curse the hour
That made me father of a son like him.

CORNELIA.
Judge not so rashly, fee and hear thy son.

ENMILIUS.

Mention him not; that father has my envy
-Who mourneth o'er his sons in battle slain.
-Short-sighted mortals ! Let no man repine
When fate bereaves him of the child he loves;
Amidst his anguish let him think of mine,
And that will comfort him.

CORNELIA;

This is not well,

Norlike my son; yet valour cannot change
its quality so quickly. He hath prov'd
His dauntless courage. Death in:terror clad
Could not dismay him. But his noble mind
Is iway'd by pity of his brother's fate,
In his involv'd.

Turn not away-
Nor hold thy TITus bfonelook unworthy;

AEM ILIUS.

Art thou my TIT u s? Thou that fear't1 to die,
And comes a fervile-fuppliarit for life !
With coward prayers to reduce the consul.
No! thou art not my son. Ihad a son r
Whose only fault was valour to excess,
Whole fatal courage was the source of ills
Which he was bound in honour to fuRain.
Thou art not he ! thou scandal to thy country!
Thou tool of MAXI MIN.

TITUS.

Wrong not thy Ton.

FaR roll the number'd moments of my life,
And I muit haflen to redeem my fame.

CORNELIA.
I fear, but know not what his words portend.

TITUS.

TITUS.

I have deceiv'd the tyrant, and am come
No messenger nor counsellor of lhame.
The cause of honour, of my father's honour,
The cause of Rome against myself I plead,
And in my voice the noble PAULUS speaks.
Let no man pity us; aloft we iland
On a high theatre, obje&ts I think
Of admiration and ofenvy rather.
The tyrant and his menac'd deaths we scorn,
The chearful victims of our sacred country.

JEMILIUS.

Hear this! 0 earth and heaven ! my son! my pride!
Come to thy. father's arms; now, now I know
My blood again. O bitter pleasing hour!
For I mull lore thee, lose thee, O my hero I
Now when I love thee belf, and most admire.

CoRNELIA.

- Preserve that virtue which you thus admire,
My son! myhulband! VARUS, pity me.

TITUS.

This to prevent I came; the force I sear'd
Of strong affection, and a mother's tears.
We saw the bury heralds come and go,
And trembled left the consul might-be'won;
For ebbing resolution ne'er returns,
But still falls farther from its former ihore.
To aid my father in this trying hour
Did I assume a dastard's vile disguise.

.E,.n-

E .MILIUS.

And did Imeet you withp h

reprc and anger?

With scorn encounter my devoted son,.
Who came to firengthen and support his fire '
Forgive me, laft;of the ,Emilian line !
Pure and unftain'd the current of our blood
Ends as it long has flow'd. .

CORNELIA. .

OVARus ! fpek;

Tell them, thou guardian'anigel of thy country ! '
That Rome does not this sacrifice demand.
Why Thould they die in vain ?

VARUS.

Thou'noble youth,

Whose life more-and mote' preciouis' fill I deem,
lam the friend of Rome ;- of yonder'holt
No slender part under my erifigns move.
With them I watch'the tyrant's'overthrow,
And guard my country with a itronger power,
Than Aquileia, and her feeble walls.
Great is thy glory,' thou haft reach'd the top
Of magnanimity in bloom of youth,
The REG:ULUS reviv'd ofantient'Rome;
Inflexible to terror, yield to prudence,
No tongue shall tax thine or thy father's fame..

TITUS. -

Renowned VARUS 'often have I heard
Of thee, and of thy virtues; oft rejoic'd,
That I could claim affinity with them ;.

. B.u t

But not the fanaion of thy honour'd voice,
Not all the credence due to-worth like thine,
Can move my iRedfaft mind.. There is but one,
One only path which mortals fafely-tread; -
The sacred path of retitude and'truth.
I.follow, tho' it leads me'to the'tomb.
Forgive me, noble Roman ! o'er thy head,
Perhaps, this infiant dire discovery hangs,
And thou and Rome are loft, and basely loft.
No, let the consul, as he ought, defy
The tyrant's threat'ning, and rely on heav'n.
For me, and PAULUS too, our hearts are six'd,
Deliberation of our state is vain:
For if the consul fmould the city yield,
Inevitable death abides his sons.

' CORNELIA.
Eternal Gods! thy mytic words explain.

TITUS.

A solemn oath determin'd we have sworn '
Ne'er to survive the ignominious ranfor.
RefRor'd to liberty, to death we fly,
And perish mutual by each other's sword.

Immortal Gods! who gave me sons like'thefe,
Forsake them not, but guard your work divine.

C6RNELIA.

My best belov'd! my darling! my fond heart
Bleed. tenderness for thee. But there is something
So awful and so great, a glory round thee,

Which

,Which dazzles and o'erwhelms me. O my son!
Is life a burden ? Lov'lt thou not thy parents ?
Who for the love of thee would gladly die. !,

TITUS. .

Think not, Obeft of mothers, befi of women,
That with unfilial arrogance I speak.
My heart is full this .instant of affection,
Hard to suppress. Dear to my foul are those
I leave behind, bitter to me their sorrows.
But deltiny fupreme-hath'mark'd my way:
And I accept what honour cannot shun.
By trivial accident, by various ills
Fatal to man, thou might't have loft thy sons,
And they in dark oblivion would have slept:
Butnow IfeethegoalthatJovE afigns,
And glory terminates our short career.
Be this thy consort; I avow it mine.
Admir'd and mourn'd by Rome, for Rome we die,
Of fate secure, immortal is our fame,
And spotless laurels deck thy childrens tomb.

CORNELIA'

Myflerious Powers ! how firange is my distress!
Thy virtue, TITUS, rends thy mother's heart 1
Ev'n now the grandeur of thy tow'ring foul
Ealts my humbler mind to thoughts like thine:
But when thou goeft, alas I I fink again,
Like the weak Pythian when her God has left her.

From hence, entrufled with your last resolve,
And, like an orator, addreft himself
To the tribunal, with a voice so rais'd,
That every soldier in the circle heard-;
And as he told a tale to move their pity,
A sudden murmur rose. The emperor
Leapt from his throne, and call'd aloud to seize
The artful traitor. Soon his guards obey'd.

Devis'd the counsel that has caus'd my woe.

Had I a magic voice, to cleave the earth,
To pluck the fun and moon from their high sphere,
Unmov'd my hulband and my tons would hear me.

And let me tell, ,what rules he hath obferv'd,

''is nature only frames the poet's heart:
Still as he thinks the feene, hefeels along,
Andfriom his bosom birfjl the raptur'dd/ong.
This is thefacred oracle, the hrine,
The bard consults, and here, the tuneful Nine.

Else vain to him, the tale of tragick 'woe.
There is a temper, `which is all and all:
That founds r efponf-ve to the poet's call.
Like Meannon's harp, uwhich pour'd harmonious lays,
Whene'er itslrings ,were touch'd by Phbbus' rays.

Ere the dread curtain role, in hafle withdrew,
And at a difance waits his doom from yo.
