THE author of the following Tragedy, has,

in his former attempts of the fame kind,

avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication
or preface. ~His chief reas~on for declining this com-
mon mode of appearing before the public, was the
necessity, which it would lay him under, of speaking
concerning himself and his works. The success of
Alonzo calls upon him to depart from his former plan s
and to break that silence, which might now be reck-
oned arrogant, and even ungrateful, to thole, from.
whom he in a great measure derives his fucceis.

H~e embraces with pleasure, this occallon, to

acknowledge his obligations to~ THE MANAGERs
of the theatre, whole friendly, _anxious, and atdive zeal
he hath To often experienced : TO THE PERFORMERS,
who have t~o firenuoufly contended with· each other,
in their very generous endeavours to embellish the re.
prefentationa of, the piece: To MIRs. BARRY-but
the public voice has exalted HER above his praif ::
Yet he. ·claims the merit of having, before others, ob-
served her now allowed and unrivalled excellency.
F~rom ,the colour of the dawn, he foretold, the brightness
of the day.

For M~ks,· BARRY 110 wrote the part ofOrmifinda,

and the moll flattering circumfiance to him, in the
s~uccess of his play, is the univers~al opinion, (vouch-
ed, not only by the 10udeit applause that ever shook
the flage, but by. the greatest effufion of tears) that the
A.CTRESS iO much exalted THE CHARACTER, that:
she exceeded all imagination, and rfeached the summit
of perfsetion.

Ox~MISINDA. TERESA.

Orm. H- IS roll contains the iecret of my life,

And o theflate My arriage with

Alonzo,

The flory of my s~on, my injured child,
Bred in a dese~rt, tho' the heir of Spain.
To thee, my faitfllul fr~iend, ny lov'd Terefai !
This precious record I commit. Ohl! keep it
From fighit ofhumnan eye, till better timles:
For flill I hope that better timles: may comne,
Tho' not to rue, to this affliiaed land.
My hand hath signed it, and mny aa to day
Shall give it faith and credence with mankind.
This will explain the mystery of my fate,
And tell~the world wh~y Ormifinda died.

rEr. Do not: too Goon defrpair·. [ie h rtn
Ormn. I wrait the last

D~ecisive moment. But to guard my foul.

B3 Againflt

Againit the sallies of a rafhh derpair,
Agiinit the weaknels which attends furpri~e.,
I have forecaIt whatever may befall,
And fram'd to the event my firm resolve.
This is the day appointed for the combat,
Between a Moorifhl and a Chriflian knight,
To end the wars of Spain, and fix the fate
O8f the contending nations.

'Ter.Antient times,

IF tales of antient times may be believ'd,
HIave known such combats, In her infant slate,
Algainft her rival Alba, Rome was pledg'd
As now Ailuria is: But later times
AAlford no parallel.

Ormr. There never was,

Nor will there ever,· while the world endures,
Be found a parallel to my distress---
I am the via5or's prize--whoe'er prevails
He gains the princess, and the crown of Spain.
Such is the solemn treaty, [worn, confirm'd,
By ever~y rite, which either nation owns.
Mean while I am Alonzo's.wedded wife--
I am a mother--by the false Alonzo,
Who from his hate to me abandons Spain,
WZhich he alone can save. No other armi
Can mlatch Mirmallon's force. Proud of his firength
Already in the lifts the MoIor exults,
Secure of viatory. The setting fun
Concludes the dreadful period of fulpence,
And death alone fromi infamy can rave mue.

'TEr. H-e yet may come. Far in the Nubian wi'lds,

'That guard the secret sources of the Nile,
Velafco found the chief. The wind of Spring,
'The constant East, this year forgot 'its season,
And only since this moon her light renew'd,
Began to blow upon the western Thore.
On that Ibuild a hope.

Ormn. I have no hope i

Review the ffory of my life, Teresa2,
And by the past conje~ture of the fhuture.

First my lamented brother, blindly fed
By proud Ramirez, quarrell'd with Alonzo,
Then by Alonzo's [wrord Ramirez fell.
·For that offence to baniihmnentt condemrf'd,
Alonzo won me to accept his hand
Before he left this kingdoml. Since that time,
What I have ifufer'd, Heav'n, and you can tell.
It was the fifth, a memorable day,
After our marriage, when he fail'd to come,
At the appointed place to meet his bride.
Then 'mlidit my fear, anxiety, and sorrow,
For only death I thought, or dangerous harm,
Could keep him from my arms, amaz'd I heard
That he was gone for Asia. To this hou~r,
Ev'n to this prelent hour, no cause alflign'd
·But these dif raated lines long after s~ent:
" Thou never ihaltt behold Alonzo more ;
" The foul, foul caule thy guilty conscience knows."'
M/y conscience knows no cause, so help me H3eav'n !
N'ow, in my utmost need, this dreadful day,
When I must firuggle with despair and Death,
To keep mys~elf a chaste, a blameless wife,
And to my silent grave the s~ecret bear,
That my dear son and his may live to wield
The feeptre of his fathers !

fer.To t~his hour,

Thy hufiband knows not that he is a father.

Omr. His ears, his eyes are Thut. Oft' have I sent

L~etters, that would have pierc'd an heart of st~one·;
;Pleading for pity, begging but to know,
WMherein I had uinwittingly offended:
But every letter, with unbroken feal,
Tlo mle return'd. H~e will not read one word
Flroml my detelted hand,

'Ter. 'Tis vtery firtange,

And m~uch unlike the way of other men.
For tho' they are inconflant in their love,
There is -ncourfle and process in the change.
Ardent at first, their ardor iafts not long.
With easy, full, secure poiffeffion cloy'd,

B 2 Their

T'heir pafion palls, and cold indifference comes,
As chilly autuma fleals on fummer's prime,
Miaking the green leaf yellow. Then it is
That some new beauty takes their roving eyes,
And fires their fancy with untafted charmls.
But in a moment, fr~om excers of love,
To the extreme of hate Alonzo paf~s'd
Without a cause. Nor did another come
Between thee and the current of his love.
'Tis moon-~firuckk madness, or the dire effeQt
Of incantation, charm, comnpulfive spell,.
By ma~gictjften'dl on his wr~etched foul.
It canl be nothing elle.

Orm. WYhate'er it is,

He thluns all woman-kind. His life is spent
In war and in devotion. When the field
Is won, the wvarrior lays aside his ijpear,
Takes up the pilgrim's ftaff, and a'l alone,
Obfcur'd in homely weeds, he bends his course
To icome riemote, religious, holy place,
Wvhere he exceedis the firifteft penitent,
Jn pen~ances f evere and fad auff er ity.
Sometimes in deeper mielancholy wrapt
He loaths the fight of man, and to the cliffs
Of hoary Caucasus or Atlas flies,
Where all the dreary wzinter he remains,
And, desolate, delights in desolation.
Myr fithful erlvant Juan thwu h~im once
Upon thep ledge of Atlls ; on a rock
Beside the emlpty channel of a brook,
He flood and ga~z'di intent a cataraft
Which, as it tumnbled from: a cliff,) .thne blaftr
H-ad? caught mid~-wlay, and frioze before it fell.
Junan drew nealr and call'd. H3e tu'rnl'd about,
Look'd at him for a ifpce, then wvav'd himl back,
An~d mounlting Cwiftly f~unk behind the hill.
W'an was his face, and like a statue pale !
HT-is eye wans wildl and haeggrdl ! Oh ! Tereth,
A4midst my woes, my mniieries, m~y wrI·ongs!i
My boson bleeds for h~im !

:Ir

fer.Somethings there is

Miyfierious and unfat~homable here,
Wrlhich passes human w~isdom to divine.
TIhe hand of fa~te is on the curtain nowr.
Within mly breatt a firm pers~uasion dwells,
'That in t:he lifts A~lon2,o will tippear.
Behold in hafle the kingi your fath~er omes~,
And1 f~eemr s tie· mess~enger of weI~ledme tidinglS,

ENter the Kjing~.

Kintg. I come in this alarming h;our, my child,

Tio pou'r a r'ay of coilfrort on thy heart.
Ai valiant Moor, once ·captive of my iiword,
And ever since, my fi~rm but: secret fr~ien~d,
Acquaints me t-hat a chainpion is at hand,
Shunning those honors which the M/oors would pay :
Dark and ref~erv'd he travels thro' their towns
WCithout a namae, I judge it is Alonzo,
For the defecription bell accord~s wit~h him.~
Scorning his foes, off~ended with his friends,
Shrouded in anger and Ex deep di~ldain,
Like fomet prime planet in ecliple he moves,
Gaz'd at: and fear'd.

Orm. It is ! It is Alonzo !

WYelcome, molt welcomre, in wvhatever· ihlape.
The hero comes to fagve his native land,
To s~ave the honor of the Christian name,
And o'er the fading crescent of the Mloor
Exalt the holy c~ross.

King.Ard, ev'n1 as thinle

Is the consentin~g voice of all the land.
The hlope of Spain on brav~e A~lonzo reftJs.
In this I f~ee the rul~ing hand of ~ea~v'n,
Which to its owsn eternal purpos~e leadis.
By winding paths, the Rieps of ·erring man .9
Painful it were to speak rS thoft events
Sad and disast~rous whish have laid us iow,
U~njuffly' was Alonzo banlifh'd hence,
And happily the hero now returns,

B 3 For

For since my· son, your valiant brother, fell',
'With an impartial mindl I have enquir'd
And trac'd the flor~y of Alonzo's birth.
He is the offspring of our antient kin gs,
The rightfud hei~r: ofRiccaredo's line,
Called the Catholic, wyho reign'd in Spain
Before the first invaflon of the M~oors.
Loft in the gen'ral wreck, buried and hid
Beneath the rudins of a fallen Rtate,
Obscure, unknown, the royal infant lay,
When I, indig~nant of a foreign yoke,
In wild Afturia sroe against the Mloors.
The righteous cause prevail'd; the bafiled foe
Retir'd, and left us and our mountains fr-ee.
The grateful people chose their l~eader king.
I knew not then, nor did my people kinowv,
Oughlt of Alonzo.

Or~m. I have heard him oatra

The juff~ice of thy ·title tdo ommand
And rule the slate thy valor hada reffor'd.
]Enough, he said, remain'd for him to conquer:
"The fe~rtile provinces of ample Spain,
WNhich fti~l the Molor uf~urps.

King.ta Of allmankihd,

Hfe is thie chamnpion whom: my foul' desires
T'his day to fig~ht for Spain ~and for. my daughter 3
Not only~ for his great renown in arm~s,
Bu1t for his birth, his lineage, and ·his blood.
If his unconquer'd ~armi in fight prevails,
TI~he~ antient mronarchy flhall rife again,
In all: its splendor and? exitent of empire.
The fitreamts of-royal blood dtivided now,
Shiall roll a tide united twro' the land.

Orm. Thy heart dilates with pleasing hopes, my

father!

And fond anticipates ;ts own desire.
]But· who can tell the purpole of Alonzo ?
His firangeapproach. no friendly afpeA bears:
H-e comes the, foe determin'di of the, M/oors,
But not to us a friend.

King. Of that no fear.

li know him proud, imnperious, and fierce,
H~aughty· of heart, and high of hand : Too p~rompt·
On all occasions to ap~peal to arms.
Bhlt he was ever gentle to my daughter :·
The proud Alobnzo bow'df the knee to thee.
At his departure 1 obferv'd thy grief,'
And in my mind---

·, (A trumnpet foundj if
Dbrm What means that thout of war i?
King. The trumpet founds to arms.

(Enter a MZef-nger.)'

Mef Thy prerence, Sir,.

Is at the camp re~quair'd. Both nations arm,
And ruih to battle: LIoudt the M~oors complain.
Of vioilated faith. A Spanilh ~knight
They, fay· hai b'roke the treaty., and attack'dl
Their bands of peace secure.

King. 'Tis barely done !

Command my guanrds to meet me at the gate.
FareweL,

[ Exit the King.

'Ter. Who can this headstrong warrior be ?

Too well Alonzo, knows the, laws of war,
Too maich reveres the treaty feal'd and fivorn,
To make a rath attempt upon the Mloors.

Ormn. If it is he, 'tis no deliberate aat

No tiheacherous intention to assail
The Moors unguarded. Yet it may be he :·
Mly mind mirgives me that it is Alon·so.
Ill would his rwelling Ipirit brook the fight
Of Mooriflh tents and arms on yonder plain.
If as he pafs'd, one slighting word was dropt,
With tenfold scorn to that he would reply,
Nor hesitate alone to draw. his fivord
Amidit an host of M~oors.

'Ter.
. 'The clamour sinks.

WVhate'er it was, the tumult is appeas'd.

B 4 And

And now~ what does my Ormifinda think
Of my prediftions ?

Orm. Oh ! my dear TerefaB !

"Thy fond desire to chear my hopeless heart
MR/akes thee forever to mly mind prele~nt
The fairest `fide of things.

'Ter. He I dott thou doubt

Still of his coming; i

Orm. No, I[ think 'tis he i

But ]hop~e and fear alternate sway iny mind :
Like light and shade upon a waving field
Coursing each other, when the flymg"S clouds
Nolw hide and now reveal the iim of heav'n.
I tremble for the issue of the combat;
And if mty lord thiould, as.I hope, prevail,
I tr~emble for myself : Afraid to fee,
Tho' sick with firong impatience to beholdl him,
And learn why he forsook his Ormifinda.
He s~ays I knowu the cause. Oh ! most unjuff i
WJas it becadie I lov'd him to excess,
Altho' his title s~hook my father's throne ?
Wlas it becaule I joinl'd my fate t~o his,
Andi fondly chose to wed a banilh'd man 2
·For finch are my demierits.

'iet·,. 'Tis but vain

Thus~~ tor torimoet tchyfelf~ and rack thy mind
W7tith fad conje~tures, at a time~ lik~e t'his,
Wchen the reality w~ill soon be known.

Ormn. I kn~ow one thing that's re'a, 'tis a fault,

An imiperfettion which I cannot cure;
Sixteen long y~ears are~ paf't since I beheld him,
And grief and c~are, tio'fe' tenants that deface
The fad and weary mansion they inhabit,
H-ave d~welt w~ith me. Am I not alter'd much ?
The ghost and fhradow of what once I was ?

Eer. No, O rrm~iiinda, I perceive no change;

That in the least impnairs thyj lovely form.,
The beam that: gilds the ~early morn of youth
Yields to the splendor of a riper h~our :
"The role that wJas to fa~ir in bixd, is blown;

And

And grief and care, tho' they have d welt with thee,
Have left no traces of their visitation,
But an impremion i[weet of melancholy
Which captivates the foul. Unfkrilf~ul they
Who dre'i the queen of love in wanrton; smiles :
Brightest th~e shines amidst a ihow'r of tears ;
T~he graces thiat adorn her beauty most,
Are fof~tneis, sensibility, and pity.

Or~m Oh! h ow in~genious thou art, Tereifa,

~How subtle to elude my fimnple fear~s !
Still they advance and gather round my heart.
If nothing can- recal Alonzo's love,
Let him but own his son, and PHl renounce
The title of his wt·ife, and of a queen ;
Then in a convent hide me and my sorrows.
The saddest fiff-er of the holy train,
Wrthole watchful zeal prevents the midnight bell,
Shall find me kneeling on the miarble floor.
Oh!i it will be the Iiuxury of grief,
To weep incessant in the vaulted cell,
To lift ~my hands, and fend my vows to heav'n,.
Invoking ev'ry power that dwells abjove,
To guard and bless my hufbandi and my son .r-
Perhaps famle fr~iend, mioft !ikely my Teresa,
Whien I am quite: orla~iken and~ forg7t
Byv all tlle worl~d, wi'll f~ill retiviinlber· me;
W~ill coiike iand t'ell me:0f Alon~zo a wars;
T·'ell how nry boy Ex~ his firfit batltle foughtj,

IMef Th~e champion, Sir,

Wh6i comies to fight for Spain, is near at hand :·
One of our scouts has seen hipxrand his train,
But brings stRrange report, whic~h damps the heart.
OF every Sp~aniard. It is-not Alonzo.

King. What fay'R thou? God of heaven!iNot Alonzo i

Who is he then ?.

Mrs T~ihat is -not fully known .

Clad in the flowing veiture ofthe~eaft,.
A Persian turban~on his head he wears,
Yet, he's a christian knight. 'To mark his faith,
Holy, and adverse to Mohanunmed's law,
B~efore his fleps, a Ilken banner borne
Str~eams in the wind, and thews a golden croils..

Kirng. Send out another rcout. i

To g~o and to, return.

And let me be obey'd. Alas! my hopes.

King. If I am, what thbn ?:
Alb. Be not offended, Sir, at my prefumption,·~j

For fromt my heart I speak, a loyal heart,
True to my fov'reign and my native land.
If this is not Alonzo, why thould he,
O~r any ithanger fight the caule of SpainZ
Are there not warriors born of Spanith race,,
Who court the combat ?

Kinag. T~o my wordsaattendl.

The Moosifh champion is of great renown a

Pitir

In (Lature like the giant race of old,
Like Anak's true, or T~itan's fabled sons.
Ag~ainst the foe nor rword nor rpear he lifts,
But in his might ·secure, a mnace he wields,
Whole sway refiftlers breaks both thield and armn,
And cruihes head and helmlet. Thus he fights,
Whole fatal prowels turn'd the dotibtful feale
Of three s~uccessive battles. He is deem'd.
·Invincible but by Alonzo's· arm :
Thberefore our warrrors, tho' they know no fear,
N~or fear of oug~ht that can thenitlelves befa!,
Anxious for Spain, to great Alonzo yield,
And on his valour reft..

A/b. 011' have I heard

Ma~y father speak of brave Alonzo's deeds ;
What can- with-hold himn when his country calls
1Perhaps the last of combats he has fought,
And in the silent tomib the hero redts.
But, since he's ablent, from whatever cauie,
O ! let no fi-ranger knight his plac-e assume,
To bring diihonour on the Spaniih name.
If this g~igantic champion of the M~oors,
Clad in the glory of his battles wron,
Dazzles the warriors, and confounds their valour;
Let me, tho' young in arms, the comibat claim,
On me his f~ame has no imipreiion made.
I'11 meet· the giant with a fearless heart.
It beats for battle now. Oft have I kill'd
T'he wolf, the boar, and the wild mounrain bull,
Ftor sport and paltimne. Shalll this Moorith dog
Rfie~t me fighting in my country's cause ?

King. By-heaven and earth, thou mov'rt me much i

Have flirr'd the emibers of my youthful fire. [thy words
Thou mak'ft me with I could recal those days,
W5hen of an age like thine, and not unlike
To thee in face and formn, I rais'J the rpear
Againfl the Moor, in Cava's bloody field.
Then by my hand the great Alchammnon fell,
The fir-ength and pillar of the Caliph's host.

But

But now, my hairs are grey, my fleps are flow,
My fwyord descending: breaks the Thield no moare :
Our foes have known it long.

Alb. O ! Kiing, thou art

Thy country's great deliv'rer, andi the ole
Refforer of the slate. Pelagio's fa~me
Shall never die: But lett thy counsel nour
(As oft thy valour) s~ave this land forom thame;
Let not a foreign warrior take the field,
And snatch the gloryl from the lance of Spain.

A handsome youth was tripping by her fide,

And in my arms the valiant chief embrac'd.
Our friendship thus commenc'd, and since that time
We have been brothers fivorn, and leagu'd in arms.

That wound which now detains him from the field.

For him I come against the foes of Spain.

With pride s~uch honors might from Spain receive;
But never can these honors grace Abdallah
Long since my heart and hand were giv'n away;
And tho' the cuitom of t~he East permits
Unnumber'd confor:s, me my faith restrains.
But if via~orious in the firife of death,
I have an earnest and a just request
To thee, O King ! which, at a proper time,

And thape, which circle round the spacious plain,
W~ere cover'd wYithl a mnultitude immense
Of either Eex, of every age and rank,
Christian and M~oor s whol~e faces and attire
Strangely diversified the living scene.

In which thy f~ather and the Maoorifh princee

There feiz'd his ppederous agace, ~beneath whose

weight,

Trhe brawny bearer bow'd ; and round his head,
Like a light foil, he flourifh'd it in air.
On him with different thoughts the na-tions gaz'd,
But suddenly a flaih of light and flamne
Struck sev'ry eye fi~ro brave Abdallahkthf8ieldi,
Cover'd till then. 'Twas made ofpolith'd Ae~-el,
Which shone like adamant ; and ·to a pograt
Role in the centre, slanting on each fide.
This thield the Persian Prince advancing bore
On his ·left arm outftretch'd, ~and in his right,
Thrown back a little, gleam'd a pointed iword.

And fiernly ey'd his near adpproaching~ foe.
Then forward ~fprunag, and on the flaming thield:
Dikcharg'd a mighty blow, enough to cruth
A wall, or Cplit a rock. The Spaniards gave
A general groan.

Once more' the Moor his thund'ring weapon ~rear'dk,
In fiept thePriic~e, and raising higoh his Ihieki,
Midway he met the blow; and with the firenegth
And vigour of his arm, obliquely down
The pond'rous mrsace he drove. Then quick as'

His better hand and foot at once advancmng,
Plung'd in Mirmpllon's throat his thirity ·blade.
The giant flagger'd for a little i~pae ;
Then falling thook tfhe earth. TFhe Christians rais'd~
A shout that rent the air. Away I came,
Happy to be the bearer; of fach tidings. [TrUmpets,

As my deliverance, vast as my diffrefs !

Big drops. Almighty God ! What dreadful birth
Do there firong pangs portend ?

A4bd. The guilty person,

Whom with~-d bJya capital offence I charge,

King. My daughter
Abd. Yes ! thy daughe

'Tis her I mean, the Princes~s Ormifinda.
Here in the presence of the Peers of Spain,
I charge her with a crime, whole doom the laws
Of Spain have wrote in blood: Adulitery.
I read astonishment in every face !
Who would f~ulpeft that one so higohly born,
With ev'ry outward marke of virtue grac'd,
Had giv'n her honour to a wor~thless wretch,
And driv'n a nob~le husband to derpair !

Kinrg. Am l awake ! Is this the light of day~ ?

Art thou, O!i Prince, with su~dden frenzy reiz'd ?
Dr is the madneis mine ? Renown'd Abdallah!i
W~hat answer can be made to such a charge
This firange demand of juffice on my daughter,
Por an offence that the could not commit ?
VMy daughter ne'er was married.

Abdal. Ask her that ?
Rear iffhe will deny she has a huiband ?

W~ho is thy haufband ? Speak ?s

Orm. The Prince Aonzo.
K~ing. And has1 thaou been To long in secret wedded ?s

'Tis eighteen years Eince he departed hence.

Orm. O ! I have reafobn to remember that.

There is no calendar To juff and true
As the fad ment'ry of a wife forifa~ken.
The years, the months, the weeks, the very dlays,
Are reckon'd, regiffer'd, recorded there !
And of that period I could cite thch times,
So dolorous, diffreifsful, melancholy,
That the bare mention of them would excite
Amazement how I live to tell the tale.
But I forget the present in ·he pas .
No wonder,- for this moment is the first
That opes the sluices of a heart o'ercharg'd,
And buriting with a flood of grief conceal'd.
But I must turn me to another theme.
The earnedt eyes of all are bent on me,
Watching my looks, and prying to dikcern
Symptoms of innocence or sig~ns .of guilt.
HE-ear then the frank con~fefiron of mny foul :
I have tranfg~rers'd.

King. Stain of a noble race !

Dost thou avow· thy cr~imne

O~rmt. Mifiake me not,

I have tranfgrefs'd my duty to my father :
Without his knowledge, and against -his w~ill,
Mxov'd by a tender lover's parting tears,
I join'd mys~elf in wedlock to Alonzo.
My king, my father, pardon the offenc~e,
Which against thee I own I have committed :
But may I ne'er of God or man be pardon'd,
Nor ~friend nor father ever pity me,
If I have iiwerv'd one itep from virtue's path,
Or broke the iimallef ·parcel of that vow
Which binds a fakithful wife ! O ! Prince of Perdia l

Thous

Thou art the best of friends and 'beneflaffo~s ;
Thou com't to end my most diffrafting wvoes,
And to dirpel th' im~penetrable cloud
That darken'd all my days. Now I thall know
Why I have been abandonm'd and foriaken,
Why I have been detefied and defpis'd,
As never woman w~as Proceed, my Lord,
And whilst, thou keenly ·dof assail my life,
And, dearer far, my ·honor anld my f~ame,
Secure in innocence, I ll calmly hear.
From thee, I hope, the enld of all my cares.

Abdal. Even thus Alonzo told ·me ihe wiouldl [peak,

And thus pro~claim her innocence.

Orm. Did he ?

O ! would to heav'n A'lonzo heard me nowr,
Fearless defend his honor and my own !
My voice, which once was music to his ear,
Like David's harp which footh'd the gloomy king,
Would charm his malady, would drive away
The evil [p~irit, and ca~ll back again
The better gen~ius of his early days.
O!i thou that wertto good, fb great i ad~m~ird
Of all mankind! i ny lo~v'd, mny 10ft Alonzo!

More than myself I modurn.

With infidelity; and crave the doorn
Of law upon her head. If any iknigh't,
Spaniard or fItranger, dates aff'ert her cause,
Let him fland fortph, and take ·my ·gauntlet up;
Which on the ground I throw, ~my gage to prove

Thou com'll infiruated in Alonzo's wrongs.
Let me conjure thee then, by all that's dear,

T~o which there is no anfwver but denial,

But never did i fight in thch a cause,

Father and fan at once. Togpther omne,

## SCENE I. ABDALLAH and VELASCO.

A CT' V. S C EN JE I.

A BDAL L AHE nd V EL~A SCO.

Tel.EFORE this day the ne'er beheld the boy.

Far from this place in Catalonia bred,

H-e came to fee the famous combat fought.
'T'was he, my ~Lord, who flew the Maoorith chief,
And in his own defence s~uch wonders wroug~ht.
That saion to the Princers made him known,
The reft in honour of his valour follow'd.

Abdal.r How dost thou knoiy ?
Vel. Waith ad4miration firuck,

WVheen he flood forth and brav'd a foe, like thee,
Ofdivers persons curious I enquir'd,
Who, and from whence he was.

Abdal Pity it were

To hurt thefitripling. 'Tis anoble boy.
I love the out~break of his Sp~aniifh fire
Againit the M~oors.

Fel. Ay, and against Abdallah,

Whom antient fame and recent glory rais'd,
Above all mortal men. Spare thls young plant,
Whomlakes so f~air a thoot.

Abdal. How canl I spare him ?

Should their eleation fe~nd him to my twvord,
Hlow, goolt Velalco ?

FelI. WVhen the peers return,

The King, the Princers, with their champion cho~en,
Then to the wond'ring audience, in the face
Of her that's guilty, let my Lord relate
Trhe truth-mark'd flory· he to me has told.

D~eteaedl

D~ete~ted thus, confounded, and f~urpris'd,
P~ierc'd with a thousand eyes, that gaze upon her,
And dart conviftion; can she iHill deny,
And by denial, make-herguilt ambiguous ?
But if her fex's genius is To firong,
That ihe the port of innocence maintains,
And, from the fulners and excess of vice,,
Derives a boldnes~s, that may look like viirtue,
T~hen let the iword decide.

Abdal. ·What you pi-opole

Is worth the-trial. I am lotheto spill
The young Alberto'sor C~oftollo's blood:
For they deser~ve n~o harm. Ev'n you, mny friend,
Before my hand unclafp;'d the book of thame,
Her chamnpion .would ·have been.

yel. Against t'he world.
Abdbl. I will adopt the counel los Veldaco,

And probe more deeply itill her~feffer'd minds.
I: fee 'tis better that the tfhould confers
Her guilt, than with hier vanquilh'd champion -fall,
By doom of law, protelling to the last
Her innocence.

Vel. B~etter-a thousa8nd times.

Her dying voice would thake-the hearts of men,
A~ud echo thro' the world.

Abdal. Behold the King.

And young Alberto marching by his fide
As if he trod on ·air.

Tel. See Ormnilinda

With folded hands implores her lilc'ning fire.

Enter the King, Ormifinda, Teresa, Alberto,

Collollo, S7c.

Kling. The peers of Spain have judg'd. Stand forth,

Alberto!i

Behold the chsmpion of my daughter's fame,
Before the trumpet's voice unfheaths the s~word
WXhich one of us shall never iheath again,
Permitg me, Prince of Persia, to intreat
A moment's audience. Not frm fear I peak,
The caule I fight for, and the mind I bear,
Exalt me far above the thoughts of danger; But

But from a cons~cious sense of what is du~e
To thee, renowh'd A3bdu~llah.: In thEe heat
Of our contenti-or, if mny tongu~e has arttefd
One word offenfiv~e to thy noble ear,
Which might iave-been em~itted, an~d the t~one
Of firm defiance equally preferv'd:;
Flortihat.I aik forgivrenef~s.

AbblG. Less Imark'd

The manner than the matter dlf thy ~pkech:
If thou 4tift need forgiveness, ·freely :tae it,

King. 'Twa~'s gene~o F~roolyi3fk'd, and ndbly granted E

Such courtery ·with w10arp ev~er diells.
.Let me too crave for a few words thine-ea~r.
Throughout the trying buns'nefs of this day,
Thou art my witner~s, t~hat my mindtlupright
Has never been by ·pow'rful nature ben-t,
Nor iway'd to favour an opinion form'd,'
By long:hribituadl and accuffom'd love:
But I with equal hand the bdlance held
Between· t~hee and my child.

Abbl. Thou ;haft :inde~edi.

It is but jdiaiee tihat :Ifhodld declare it.

Kintg. T~hen to thy· can dou r let me ~nowy appeal,

And beg of thee ·to grant me one reque'it,~
Which I do not, but might perhaps, command.,

Abbld. What is it .F
King. I have Tharch'd my'haplef~s child,

Ev'n to the pith and marrow of her foul,
Have touch~'d her to the quick. She never ihrinks
Nor wavers in the least. Perhaps, mry L~ord i
Some fool officious, or some wretch that's worse,
(If there is oughlt comes between man and wife
T'hatls m~ore~pernicious than a medling fool)
Some ~false designing friend has wrong'd her fame,
And pour'd his poison in Alonzo's ear.
If thou wilt give fomne scope to her defence,
And bring the charge'from darlkneis into light,
Then The sh~all Tforthwith anfwver on the s~pot
Where now the flands before us.

If but one dark fulpicious Cpeck remains
ToQ make mine honour dim, let me be held
Guilty of all. ' Before-hand I renounce
The right of combat, and f~ubmliit to die.

Abdal. Thy with is fatal, but it thall be granted, ~

Tshis initant too.

Omr. BleliTngs upon thy head i

Ten thousand blessings ! O ! thou dost not know
How happy thou hall made me. On my breast
A mountain lay : TFhy hand has heav'd it ofg,
And now I breathe again.

Abdal. O woman ! woman !

A little way from hence my people wait;
Wi~th them remains a necessary witness.
Thither I: go, and~ quickly will return
To ring thy knell. [ Exit Abdallah,]

Orm. The knell of all my woes r

IV~y heart knocks at my fide, as if 'twould burst
Itlelf a passage outwards. Ybet a while a
Poor ufilfring heart, and thou thalt beat no more.
Shot tly for what I am I thall be known:
Then let mdy doom be fCquar'd to my dlefert
W~ithout indulgence.

Kling. I can truss thee, now :

Thine eye lecure beams innocence and honour.
Thoua art my daughter itill.

Alb. If ear, O King !

Some pra~tice vile, some infamous impolbure,
Supported by false witnels. Still I with
TPhe fair decision of the honest fiverd.

~Enter ABIAL us in a Span~fh Dre/s as ALonzo.

Orm. I appeal to Heav'n,

Jufitce on earth will come too late For me.
KPing. Haft thou no other witneifs than thyself ? [ToAlan.
Alan. I have no other, and none else require.
King. Unfeeling man, to trifle with our sorrows,

And like a pageant play a mimic scene:
This is thy hatred of: Pelagio's houre,
Thy passion toconfound a rival race.
Would I were young again i

Alb. ]Defend thys~elf. [iTo Alonzo.]

I can no longer hold me from thy breaff.

Ormt. Hold ! Strike thro'me !ap bt

Y~ou know not what you do, unhpybh
This combat ·must not, nor ·it thall not be.
TFhe Sun in Heav'n would backward turn his couarfe,
And shrink from su~ch a fpeltacle as this,
More horrid than the b~anquet: of Thyefies.
You have no quarrel.~ I1l remove the caule.
A Roman matron, to redeem her fame,
Befo~re her hufband's and her father's eyes
Plung'd in her breaf t the f leel. [Statbs hterfel, and falls.

Kl~ing. Of Delp'rate deed

What fury ur~g'd thy hand

Ormt. Condemn me not'.

TLhere was no other way to fiave--but that
Mult not as yet be told. My hulband! hear
May dying voice i my lat~est words -believe,
Whole truth my blood hath feal'd : I'm innocent.
As I for mercy hope at that tribunal
Where I thall soon appear, I never wrong'd thee.
When that is manifest, remember me
As love like mine deferv'd, and to this youth,
W~ho is-

Alon. Who is this youth ! All-feeing God !

A secret horror comes upon my foul.
Wlho is this youth! Ora-~.

Ormv. He is thy son.
Al'on. My s~on !
Otrm. Whom thy forl~aken wife in sorrow bore,

.And gave in secret to Collollo's care.

Alb., Art thou my mother! D off thou die for me
Orm~. I die with pleasu~re to be just to thee,

O!i if ·that Power which did inspire my foul
T o runh between your swords, would let me live,
To prove my innocence. Alonzo rpeak!
WVhilft I hmave breath to adwier.

Alon. T'ho' dilarm'd

And foften'd, even if guilty to forgive thee,
Thy solemn call I instantly obey.
That night appointed for our last farewel,
That fatal night for ever curit-t-h'ou know'ft
What happen'd then.

Orm. I know thou didft not come,

Porlorn thou lefted'ft me.

Alon. Tihou waft not forlorn,

In the dairk wood with thee there ·was a youth.

WMas fright'ned in the wood, and I aflfumed
That warlike form to s~eem---

Alon. Ndo matter why ?

1For in my breast is pent as hot a Aire:
