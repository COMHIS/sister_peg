# PROLOGUE.

R L 0 GU E.

Spoken by Mr. B A R R Y.

HEN first the children of the Muse began
To try their magic on the mind of man,

ftonifh'd mortals saw, with wond'ring eyes,
ie fair creation of the bard arise.
Hence is deriv'd the Poet's lofty name,
or Poet and Creator mean the fame;
e, from his fancy, where the feeds of things,
s in a chaos lie, to order brings
Vorlds of his own and builds the lofty rhyme
trhofe polisl'd strength defies the rage of time.
I Such were the bards, whom we too call divine,
lormer the father of the godlike line,
}he Mantuan bard, whom all mankind admire
For sweet expression and for vestal fire.
Shakefpear and Milton, both in England born,
Whose glorious names the QOeen of Isles adorn,
Who, proudly fitting on her azure throne,
In arts and empire will no equal own.

Thus far our Author as a Prologue writ,
And would have been, I think, a-writing yet,
Enamour'd of his theme.-But I drew near,
lAnd whifper'd that of him you wish'd to hear.

'Twas difficult he faid-in such a cafe

|He could have wish'd another in his place;
tTo tell, with what alternate hopes and fears,
An anxious Author on the Stage appears;
For, like the nightingale, he hath addreft
pHimfelf to fing-a thorn at his fond breafi.
If, like the native warLlcr of the grove,
His plaintive notes are full of tender love;
Your hand may pull the thorn that caus'd his pain
And give him spirit for a nobler strain,

K A T H U L.

My faithful Euran!

Those dastards left their master in the storm
That rose at eve: my son hath pass'd the night
Alone upon the hill beyond the lake.

E U R A N.

Of him no fear; both hill and dale he knows,
Cavern and cave and every ihelcer'd fpotl
Of the wide forest.

KA THUL.

Not one moment's peace

Have I enjoy'd, since to the Pi&ifh king
I gave my daughter's hand. Unhappy {he,
In secret anguish pines her life away!
My son, afflicted, Ihuns his father's fight,
And, in the woods and foiefts, waftes his days;
A lonely hunter. To complete my woes,
Our new ally keeps not his promis'd time;
Is this his Pictih faith ?

E U R A N.

Doubt not, 0 king!

Doubt not the faith of Durftan, nor the love
He bears his queen.---Soon shall you fee his fails
Rife on the distant wave, white as the fowls
That chafe the fiying fhoals.---When he arrives;
Let not indulgence grant the least delay,
But waft Rivine to the Pictiih Ihore.
When she has left the place, where every tree
And rock and haunted stream recal the memory

2 Of

Of what she should forget, her grief will fly
Like mist before the wind.

KATHUL.

Rather the mist

Will thicken into darkness. Euran, my heart
Misgives and chides itself. Sprung as I am
From ancient Albion, in her evil days
I left her fhatter'd fide. By passion fway'd
And rage at perjur'd Ronan, I forsook
The stock of which I came, and join'd myself
By ftri& alliance to her mortal foe;
To him, whose arm had hew'd her branches down.
From deeds, like this, in wrong of nature done,
Observers date commencement of decay,
And strange disaster to the guilty line.

E U R A N.

Disaster seize on him who broke his faith,
And threw away the pearl of womankind !
0! could my with recall that signal hour
When Elig's hall blaz'd with a thousand ihields
Of kings and heroes. Emulous to please
The all-admired daughter of the Isles!
Rivine, partial to her brother's friend,
Preferr'd the prince of Morven ; tho' by far,
In wealth and power, inferior to the Pit,
And other royal suitors for her love.
Yet he, diftinguifh'd, favour'd, honour'd thus,
Ungrateful man! forsook the matchless maid,
Without complaint, pretence, abandori'd her,

B Ta

To wed the queen of Erin*.-In my mind
Most happily for thee, and for thy house ;
Else thou, the friend of vanquifh'd Albion, till
Hadst shar'd the fortunes of a ruin'd people.-

K A T H U L.
Not ruin'd yet-

E U R AN.

Expell'd their native land,
Their king and more than half his princes slain;

K A T HUL.

Another king succeeds: Congallus claims
His rght of blood.-Here in the bay last night
A rover of the main his vesel moor'd;
He told me he had seen on Norway's coast
A sicet immense: far off, it feem'd a wood,
Stretching from cape to cape; as if the firs
From their eternal mountains had come down,
To grow amidit the waves.

E U R A N.

Was this huge fleet
Prepar'd againit the Pict ?

K AT 'H U L.

It was; and charg'd

With mighty armies: both the kings were there
Or + Lochlin and of Norway-On the deck
Of one, the headmost ship, Congallus stood,
Wooing the winds to fill his hoified fails:
\:ith him, a multitude of warriors, born
In various climes, of the Albanian race;
Who, though they never law their father's land,

Ireland, -t Denmark,

Call it their country too. The foremost they,
The fiercest in her cause.

E U R A N.

'Tis Ronan's cause!

For him the sons of Erin lift the spear;
For him the kings of Scandinavia arm.
But let them come, the pirates of the North!-,
Strong is the Pic, and mighty his allies !
Who can resist the Romans ?

K A T H U L.

By their force,

And not his own, tho' he is great in arms,
The Pia o'er Albion's warlike sons prevail'd;
But now the Roman eagle southward flies;
The dark-ey'd chief his legions has withdrawn,
To quell the Britons ; nor can Durftan hope
Their present aid.-

E U R A N.
-I trust he shall not need!
Behold Rivine comes.- [Looking towards the wood.

K A T HUL.

-Entranc'd in thought-

See how (he tofres to the skies her arms,
Now wrings her folded hands! Thus is (he wont
To wander thro' the woods, ever alone,
And ever mourniig. Like a wounded deer,
Apart (he stalks and seeks the darkest shade
Of hanging rocks, and melancholy boughs,
To hide and nourish her determin'd sorrow.-

Let

Let us avoid her. 0! unhappy child!
I fear thy father's counsel has undone thee [Exela,

Enter RIVINE.

R I V IN E.

How soon is evil done ! The sycamores,
The pines, whose bulk fuccefive ages rear'd,
The tempest of one night hath overthrown !
Thou too art fallen, thou fair and fiately oak,
Beneath whose pleasant ihade Rivine fate,
When first {he listen'd to false Ronan's love.
O ! thou expressive emblem of my state !
Like thee, the chief in beauty and in place,
I flourih'd cnce; now rooted up like thee,
I wither on the field. Daily I die!
De.ightd, I perceive my swift decay.
There will I make my grave; under that rock
In peace shall reft the daughter of the Isles,
WVho, 't;ll fie's !aid in earth, no peace can know,
No peace for me ! ! how I envy you,
Ye lovelorn maids ' who, flighted and forsaken,
Ye; enter: ir no motion of revenge,
Bur: in;! L: b-a. vor w'or.cgs, decline and die,
The bt;-.cle: ^*c. Cims cf inco;nfant man!

En:er CON N AN.

H- ! does my brother come to fee Rivine !
\!V::! h:zs rrcuir'd me this unwonted favour?

C 0 N N A N.

PcFr.k:,', in priudence rnd in love to thee,
i i.-_.:ld conceal my tidings; but my heart

Can:ot

Cannot contain them. Tho' it make thee wretched,
yet I must tell thee, that my friend is wrong'd.
Ronan is innocent ; he loves thee still;
He never ceas'd to love thee!

RI V IN E.

I believe it.

He never ceas'd to love, who. never lov'd.
But why pretend, why counterfeit again ?
Has Erin's queen found out how false he is,
And thrown the specious traitor from her arms ?
And does he think once more to find Rivine
Free, credulous and fit to be deceiv'd ?
But me he thinks not of; he courts thy aid;
He needs the valour of his partial friend.
A stranger still to what his crimes have done,
He knows not who I am; he does not know,
That Connan's valour guards the Piatih throne.

CONNAN.

iThis fash of indignation, 0! my fifRer!
Gleams for a moment o'er thy troubled mind;
!But darkest woe ihall shortly close around thee.
I have a dreadful story for thine ear.-

RIVINE.

A dreadful story! how can he be wrong'd,
Vrho publicly renounc'd his plighted faith,
|Plighted a thousand times ?

C ON NAN.

He never did:
He sent no meffige to renounce thy love.

RIVINE.
(I

R IVINE.
What then wasValma ?

CON AN.

An unhappy wretch,

The slave of gold; gain'd by the worst of men,
To work thine overthrow.

RIVINE.

Leave me to judge
Of my condition. Tell me what thou know'ft.

CONNAN.

I need not tell Rivine why I shunn'd her,
Since Durifan was her husband; I have fled
The human race, diffrated in my mind,
With grief and shame and anger: oft my foul
Refolv'd revenge on Ronan. By-and-by
Something would whisper that we were deceiv'd;
That noble Ronan never could be base.
Perplex'd with thoughts like there, I rang'd the woods
And heeded not the game my dogs purfu'd.
The storm of yesterday furpriz'd me, ftray'd
Beyond my usual bounds; nor could I find,
Amidst the darkness of the driving blast,
A path to guide aright my doubtful steps.-
As night came on, more furious grew the form.
The thunder bellow'd and the lightning glanc'd
Along the dreary heath: before, behind
And on each fide, the sudden torrents roar'd.
I wander'd on and frequently I thought,
The world without was like my troubled mind.
At last, far in the east, whence the wind blew,

I hearl

heard the howling of a ihepherd's dog;
ith lighter steps, I turn'd me to the found
id heard it oft repeated. As I hop'd,
tled me to a hut-I entered there;
And, by the embers of a fire of turf,
saw a ghastly man ftretch'd on a bed
ffRicks and heath compos'd. Come near, he said,
And liften to the dying voice of Valma.-

R I V I N E.
,Of Valma !-

CONN AN.

Valma, whom I had not seen

Since he, for Erin, with his master fail'd:

found he did mistake me for his hoff,
fnd silent listen'd with a beating heart.
our charitable cares, he said, are vain;
y hourdraws nigh.-Good lhepherd,you have lodg'd,
nder your blameless roof, the bafelt wretch
hat ever liv'd on earth. My name is Valma,
hefavour'd servant of the prince of Morven.
y master sent me, from green Erin's ihore,
ith tokens and a message to his love,
The fair Rivine: but a tempest drove
My luckless vessel on the Pidilh coast.
Durfan, the king, by promises and threats,
ompell'd me to deceive the conitant maid,
And falsely to report, that my brave lord
Renounc'd her love.-Rivine, thou grow's pale
Lean on my arm.-

C RIVI N.

RI VIN E.

No: I have strength enough!

Lead me, my brother! lead me to the place
Where Valma is.

C O N N A N.
At midnight he expir'd-

R I V I N E.

Would he had liv'd one other day for me!
0 ! I had much to afl him: did not Ronan,
With eyes of love behold the beauteous queen?
So I have often heard and that was told
Long before Valma came.-

C ONNAN.

Ay, so it was

Contriv'd and told, on purpose to prepare
Thy mind, thus tainted, to receive the tale.
But know, for I explor'd the heart of Valma,
The noble Ronan, in the hall of kings,
Who fought alliance with so brave a chief,
Fondly difplay'd-his paffon for Rivine.
With gems of thine he deck'd his conq'ring arms,
And rais'd the song of beauty to thy praise !
Such oilentation wither'd the desire
And kili'd the hope of every bluihing maid.
The hero comes, unalter'd in his lovw,
And finds thee--

R I V I NE.

Connan! me he shall not find!
We ne'er shall meet again-when does he come ?

cO N N A N

CO N N A N.

Be.like to-morrow, or perhaps to day.
This is the appointed time, the season meet
For enterprize of arms. Now the mild moon
Of autumn rites when the fun descends,
And at the self-same hour, for many a night,
Lifts her fair head, to bless with light the world.
I mean to share the perils of my friend;
Nor lhall Rivine as an hostage go
Against her brother's and her Ronan's sword.

RIVINE.

Would that the swords of both were in my breast!
Ye winds, that I have wilh'd fmould sleep for ever
Ye southern winds! from Etha's mountains blow,
And waft to Elig's bay the Piailh fleet
I go to Durftan's kingdom-

CONNAN.

Go, and perish!

Haft thou no rage, no indignation in thee ?
No generous drop in thy exhausted veins ?
Art thou so tame, so vile, so base of foul,
To bear the fight of Durftan ? Crimes like his
Diniblve all ties. Betides his wrongs to thee,
lie inurder'd Valma on the lonely heath;
Murder'd the traitor to conceal the trealbn.

RIVI N E.

Yes, I am base and vile; my foul submits
To each opprobrious name from Ronan's friend;
But I am not so tame : my heart is full
Ofrage, of anger and of mortal hatred !-

C 2 C O N NAN.

CONNAN.
To whom ?

RI V IN E.
To Durftan's wife.

CONNAN.

Renounce the name,

And thou may'st ftill-Thy brother will defend,
And save thee from his power.

RIVINE.

O ! save not me

From any misery ! But tell me rather,
How I may be more wretched than I am:
If thou can's tell. Farewel my native land !
Ye woods and streams of Elig's vale, farewel!
Rivine leaves you with a broken heart,
To waste her days in horror and delpair,
With the derefted author of her woes.
But welcome woe to me ! Fool that I was,
A wretch unworthy of a hero's love,
Who readily believ'd a lying tale,
Against the honour of the first of men:
Then in the cursed hour of jealous rage,
Gave up myfelfto misery and Durftan.

'Tis too late!-

I Ihould have thought before I wedded Durftan.
Now would'fl thou have me flay till Ronan comes ?
'Tis not his anger, nor his hate I fear;
:No, nor his scorn. Myjuf desert is scorn;
|But hide me, rocks and mountains, from his pity!
iAs the fond parent to the child relents,
iWhen fore affliction lays th' offender low;

And, with a look of infinite affetion,

Above a flood unfathom'd.-O ! those tlaves!
Who gave assurance of the death of Valma,
And boasted each that his good sword difpatch'd him.
The blame as yet on Durftan only falls.
Would I had never join'd my hand to his,
Nor touch'd the proffer'd gold ! -Oft have I heard,
And now at last believe, 'tis safer far
To deal deceitfully with crafty men,
Than pratlife art on unexperienc'd youth,
Whose pafiions sally out beyond conjecture,
And, by extravagance, confound the wife.
The passions of this prince are like the wind:
The Pilifh name is odious to the tribes,
Whose hearts still sway to Albion's kindred race.
IfConnan calls to arms, enrag'd they rife,
Like billows when the furious tempest blows.-
The kings have met: how hfall I warn the Pic
Without alarming Kathul ?-Here they come.

Pi&ifh Chiefs.

DURSTAN.

Excuse my long, involuntary absence!
Uncertain is his hour whose work is war,
Who takes his way across the changeful main.
Euran, thou faithful servant of thy lord,
I greet thee well.

EURAN.

With joyful heart, 0 king!
I fee thee in the wifh'd-for hour return,

DURSTAN.

Soon must I quit again this friendly ihore;
For I am doom'd to pass my life in arms.-
The wandering heir of Albion's vanquifh'd line,
Congallus, threatens to invade my kingdoms.
This on the seas I learn'd.

KATHUL.

I can confirm
The truth of that report.-

DURSTAN.

King of the Isles

I'll give those bold invaders warlike welcome !
At eve, with favouring tide, I fail again.
The radiant moon, with all her splendor, flines
To light my vessel thro' the watery way.
Impart my purpose to thy beauteous daughter,
And tell the urgent cause.

K A THUL

K A T H U L.

-Urgent, indeed;

Unwilling as we are so soon to lose thee;
Tidings like these admit of no delay.
But let us spread the feast and raise the song,
Whilst yet thy Rteps are here. Sweet to.the ear
Is melody and pleasant to the foul
The tale of battles fought and woes endur'd,
By chiefs, who long have ceas'd from'war and woe.
We, in our turn, 0 King! ihall pass away,
And in the song be found.-

Stay not the feast, there's danger in the hall;
Demand thy queen; her brother knows too much.

KATHUL.

NNow, as becomes thee, meet thy husband's love,
jAnd look complacent on the Pidtih chiefs;
Through many dangers they have reach'd the shore.

DURSTAN.

Cold is my welcome ! slowly The approaches,
Silent and fad, six'd on the, earth her eyes.
With such reluctance, such averted looks,
In bitterness of foul, a captive comes
Before the conqueror, whose hands are red
With her dear kindred's blood.

King of the Piss,

Thou read'ft my thoughts aright, within thy breaf
Dwells an interpreter that cannot err.-

D. U R S T A N.

To there injurious words, 1 know not, Queen!
What answer best belongs. Thy gloomy mind
Some foul suspicion of thy husband stains,
Changing to hatred and to harsh disdain,
That melancholy and that cold reserve,
Which I regretted once. Unfold thy thoughts!
And show the viper that has stung thy foul.
She heeds me not. Ha! wherefore dost thou tremble
And stare so wildly on a stranger's face ?

R I V I N E. to one of t/b Piets.]

Permit me, firanger, to behold that sword,
Trult it, I pray, one moment to my hand.

[The Pi& gives tbe word.

It is, it is his sword. I know it well,
This jewel once was mine !

KATHUL.

What means my daughter?

RIVINE.

Behold the sword of Ronan. 0 ! my father!
Too certain sign the hero lives no more.
Is this tly nuptial present, cruel king !
But I accept it for it suits our love.

D URSTAN.

Not in the hearing of these gallant chiefs,
Whom I would wifi to hold thee high in honour,

Will I reply to palion. Thou haft nam'd
The owner of the sword. His it may be;
But whose it was, I never knew before.

RI V IN E.

Thou can'st no more deceive me. The long train
Of treachery and lies, the murder too
Has been deteced. Miserable Valma
Liv'd only to reveal it.-Now thou com'ft,
With this proud trophy of thy work complete.
0! thou sole relique of the first of men
Signal of death ! memorial of the brave !
Companion of my woes, perhaps the end!
Why didR thou thirst, O ! Durftan for his blood ?
Hadst thou not wrong'd him, was not that enough
But thou didft wifely, to consult thy safety,
For conscience told thee, whilst the warrior liv'd,
The robber was not safe.

DURSTAN.

Thy words are madness;
If I had kill'd him, was he not my foe ?

RIVIN E.

How did the hero fall ?-By fraud he fell!
For he was fill invincible in arms,
Alone a match for many in the field.

D U R S T A N.

That sword, the fight of which diiturbs thy foul,
Is not the trophy of a hero slain;
In evil hour I found it.

RIVINE.

Found it, where ?
Was not its owner near ?

D 2 DUR.

D U R S T A N.

If he was near,

Thou haft conjetured right, helives no more:
For where I found it death and horror reign'd.

R I V I N E.

Now, I believe thee,.Duftan ! Tell me, Pia !
How, when, without a matier too thou found'ft
His sword who never yet was foil'd in arms ?

D U R S T A N.

As in our way to thee we croft those seas,
Whose rage scarce summer tames, a tempest rose,
A dreadful one, as ever swept the main.
All night we labour'd in the jaws of death,
But, when the morning dawn'd, the tempest ceas'd;
Red, on the troubled deep,.the fun arose,
And shew'd a dismal obje& to our eyes;
Fast, on a ridge of rocks,. a wreck appear'd,
Which feem'd the ruin of a noble veflel;
Near as our safety would permit we fail'd,
Andview'd thefate,which might havebeen our own.-
The ihip was broken, by the heavy seas
Parted in two; and all about the rocks
Dead bodies floated, on the toiling waves.

R I V I N E.
Was there no living creature ?

D U R S T A N.

No, not one,

Low are the rocks; their ragged tops are seen,
And barely seen above the finootheft sea;
But in a storm their place is known afar,
EB the white waves, that rage, and swell, and break

Like

Like mountains o'er them; there no man could live.
Who'er aboard that luckless vessel fail'd,
Embrac'd the fame inevitable doom.-

RI V I N E.
Was the sword there ?

DURSTAN.

It was. About to leave

The wreck, we fought some token of the dead
By which they might be known, that sword we spied,
Caught in the cordage of a maR it hung
And glitter'd through the water.-

RI V INE.

'Tis enough!

If at my feet his breathless body lay,
I could not be more certain of his fate.
In those wild waves the chief of warriors died;
To me he hasten'd through the seas and florms;
Unknowing of his wrongs for me he died.

KATHUL.
Forbear, my daughter ! for my fake forbear!

D U R S T A N.
And for thine own, O queen ! refpe& thyself.

R I V INE.

I will. For ever I renounce thee, Duritan !
i ro Ronan's memory I devote my days!
Few are the days that of my life remain.
Hear me, amaz'd fpetators! ye who think
i Rivine has forgot her sex's hame;
And judge me with more justice. In my hand
I hold the sword of Ronan. Who he was,

And

And of what high renown, is not unknown;
For thro' the kingdoms of the North his name
Flew on the wings of Fame.--His love to me
And mine to him, for I avow my love,
My fire approv'd.-To him I was betroth'd,
But in his absence, DurRfan did reduce,
A faithless servant to betray his master.
He fram'd a message from the noble Ronan,
Reje&ing me, and setting free my faith;
Then urg'd a fond exasperated maid,
And with the help of her deceived father,
Precipitated her diforder'd mind,
To yield a rash confent.-That was my crime,
Which I deny not; nor refuse to bear
My punishment, which, like my crime, is great.
Despair consumes me ! wither'd like the leaf
Of autumn is my beauty, Now I stand
On the dim threihold of the house of darkness;
Remorse pursues Rivine to the tomb.

That never burns in peace ? Where is my son ?

Stands like a tower. His angry voice he fends,

And of a king the wife! the pledge of peace
Among the nations; be not thou the cause
Of war and mortal strife! thy name flall go,
To future times for good, or ill renown'd,
The curse or blessing of thy native land,
And of thy father's house. My child be wife!
Forget the past, which cannot be recall'd;
And arm thyself with patience.-

[Exit Kathul and Euran.
DURSTAN.

Sweet the voice

Of those that counsel peace. Rage was not made
Nor lasting anger for a gentle breast.-
My foul is innocent of Ronan's face .
And if I used some art againit a rival,
Ascribe it only to excess of love.---
Wife are thy father's words. Forget the past,
And be hereafter happy.-

I hate the present; I abhor the past

VWhere once with peace and innocence I liv'd

Till thou cam'ft hither. Thou haft made me wretched
Beyond all utterance, example, thought
Or stretch of fancy. When the mournful bard
Seeks a fad subje&t for the midnight song,

My safety, PiF, depends not on thy will.
Behold my force, to thine superior far.-

But fair and equal, man to man, I meet thee,

I take no base advantage of a foe.-

And dost thou ask if Connan be thy foe ?

At once the hero parted. Ah! my filter '
How came it hither ?

Durfran!
CONNAN.

Ha the spoils
Of Ronan by his foe in triumph borne !

No tears I shed: red are thy drops, revenge !
DurfRan, call up thy courage; rear thy crest,
And to a bold defiance, boldly answer.
I charge thee firR with treachery and falsehood,
Crimes that firike down the warrior's gallant plumes:
With murder next, for wretched Valma's death;
For Ronan last; for Ronan, barely slain;
By hands like thine, he could not else have fallen.
With mortal hate I call thee to the combat.

RIVINE.

My Brother, hear me ! Not by Durftan's hand,
Nor by the arm of man, did Ronan fall.
Far from the shore, amidst the stormy waves,
Amongst the cordage of a vesTel wreck'd
The sword was found.-Forgiven be my wrongs,
And to his kingdom let the Pic return.

D U R ST A N.

Great is thy clemency ! Permit the Pi&,
Injur'd, defy'd, dilhonour'd, to be gone.-
Is DurRan's name of such account in Elig ?
Are there the terms on which he quits the field ?
Connan, thy challenge and thy wrath I scorn;
Thyfifter, as my'queen, Ijuftly claim:
If the's with held, I shall lay waste your Isles,
And to my kingdom's add one sceptre more.

CONNAN.

If she desires to pass her days with thee,
She is not worth the splinter of a spear.
But if her foul reveres her lover's shade,
And flies from thee to solitude and sorrow,
JMy sword from insult shall the mourner guard.-

E 2 Thy

-hy threats I'laugh at; thou unwarlike king,
To boast of conquest and refuse the combat.
Wilt thou not fight, thou chief without a foul?
Then fly without delay. Now make thy choice;
Begone or draw thy sword !

D U R S T A N.

Vain-glorious youth!

Thou fit companion of the boaster Ronan,
Whom I could wish this moment in thy place !
I'll seek the king. If he denies me justice,
Unworthy as thou art of Durftan's sword,
Expect me soon.

CONNAN.
Thou wilt not come so soon
As Connan wishes.-- [Exit Durftan andPi&s,

RI V IN E.

Why this strife for me?

Who ifould be shunn'd like the infeEious blast,
Which, where it takes, destroys. Ronan is dead.
Let not the friend of Ronan fall for me.
I have a refuge sure. Behold yon cliff,
WThofe summit, jutting o'er its wave-worn base,
Darkens the deep below.

CONNAN.

Fly from despair!

And seek the shelter of thy brother's love.-
The friend of Ronan will protet Rivine.
If the pale ghost that dwells amidst the storm
Retains th' affe&ions of its former slate,
C'er us -he ghost of Ronan fliall rejoice.-

SCENE, a Cliffon the Sea-thore, with a Cave,

RIVINE and ORELLAN.

OR E LL AN.

B E H O L D the habitation of Orellan!
For threescore years and ten this rock has been
My dwelling-place; and here I fit in sorrow,
Silent and motionless from morn to eve;
'Till the sea-fowl, that skim along the shore,
Fearless alight, and, fitting at my feet,
Scream their wild notes, as if I was a stone
Or fenfclefs trunk, that could not do them harm,-
It was not always thus; I was not born
To misery; nor in the wild woods bred
Of savage race; fair was my morn of youth !
With thy brave grandsire I was train'd to arms,
His chosen warrior, and his trusted friend.
But love and jealousy furpriz'd my foul,
Drove me from men, and blotted out my name.
This arm flew Namora.

R I V I N E.

Father, forgive

My importunity ! Vouchsafe to tell
What I in part have heard.

ORELLA N

ORELL AN.

My ifory's old,

Thy sorrow recent : but to hear my woes
Will teach thee patience. Such as thou art now,
Or as thou waft, e'er grief had made thee wan,
Namora was. Like thine, her beauty charm'd
Contending princes; but the generous maid
Preferr'd to princes fond Orellan's love.
Daily we met in woods, in groves, in glades,
Remote and secret. One unhappy time,
Returning from the chace, I fought the grove.
Ent'ring, I saw Namora; her white arms
Embrac'd a youth; her lips were join'd to his.
My bow was in my hand; I bent it soon,
And pierc'd them with one arrow. Ere I reach'd
The spot on which they fell, Namora's eyes
Were clos'dfor ever. The expiring youth
Was her brave brother, to his native mhore
That day return'd. His filter's steps he trac'd,
To perish in her arms. I kneel'd me down,
And begg'd the warrior, if he yet had strength,
To give me death. He heard me not, he died,
And left me living.-This bleak cave I chose,
My everlasting mansion. In thole days
The hollow ihore resounded with my cries.
Often the hunter hasten'd from the hill,
And oft the mariner fteer'd from the deep,
And wonder'd at me. Time, that rage subdued
To milder grief. My tears incessant flow'd
Like waters from the rock. Here have I mourn'd

An
.

An age of man compleat. Alike to me
Summer and winter, autumn and the spring,
And night and day the fame.-

R I V IN E.

Thus would I wilf

To waste my days, a fpe&acle of woe!
Without or change or interval. I feel
Within myself a source and spring of sorrow,
That ne'er will cease to flow, 'till death ihall stop it,
Surely the spirits of the dead delight
To be remember'd, and lamented, father.

0 RE L L A N.

Daughter, they do-my own experience tells,-
Once every year, that day Namora died,
A wondrous vision comes. In the fill air
(For not a breath then stirs the silent bay)
Are heard the saddest, yet the sweetest founds,
That ever touch'd the ear or heart of man,
The melody of woe.-Then from the skies
Descend the shadows of the murder'd pair,
Pale as the colours of the lunar bow.
Hov'ring before the cavern's mouth they spread
Their arms; they fix on nitheir pitying eyes,
And, with a shriek, they vanish into air:
Does hoar tradition tell a tale like this ?
Was ever mortal destiny like mine ?

R I V I N E.

Could I but hope to fee my love arise,
And look on me with pity; I would live
In the vast ocean on a rock alone..

But

But Ronan's injur'd ghost detetcs Rivine.-
In the dark world of spirits thou shalt join
Thy dear Namora's slade; but far from mine
The angry spirit of my love will fly.-.

R E LL A N.

I have anothercharge besides thee, daughter!
Within my cave, a wretched stranger lies,
Who tailed all the bitterness of death;
But scarce yet knows his wonderful escape.

R I V I N'E.
Escape from what ?

O R E L L A N.

From shipwreck in the storm
That raged last night upon the rocky shore.

Thy colour flifts

From pale to red, from red to pale again.
What dost thou hope or fear ?

RIVINE.

A strange event I

Yet, like the fate and fortune of my life,
Wild and incredible. Perhaps this youth
Sav'd from the wreck, and sleeping in thy cell,
Is Ronan.

ORELLAN.

No; delusive are thy hopes;

The various vest and floating robe I know
Of Albion's warlike race. He wore not those.
His dress is splendid, bright with foreign gold,
And marks the chieftain of a distant land.

RI V I N E.

Enter, and if he sleeps, to me return,
I will behold and bless him where he lies;
Then from his presence fly, if it is Ronan.

Almost as much as life.

My love is here!

Thy love! approach me not !
Thou noble youth ! nor call Rivine thine.

R O N A N.
Not call thee mine!

Unworthy of the air that Ronan breathes.
When thou shalt know what cannot be conceal'd
Thou must abhor me.

Ah! thou art chang'd indeed since I beheld thee!
Anguilh gleams in thine eye, and wild despair

Whose heart is breaking! Fain, fain wou'd I speak,
And tell thee how Rivine was betray'd.

And thou (halt have an answer to thy question.

Answer at once: is mhe not wedded, fay ?

Dost thou fay yes ?

ORELLA N.

Unwillingly I speak the painful truth:
My foul is griev'd for thee.

R 0 N A N;
RONAINa

Thou art the cause

Of what I susser. Thy officious hand
Sav'd me from death, to make me perish worse.
My latest thought when finking in the storm
Was of Rivine; of her love, her truth,
Her grief eternal for her Ronan loft.-
And now 1 find her in another's arms;
Of me regardless, though my faithful heart,
Full of her image, for her fake defpis'd
The beauteous queen of Erin's warlike land.

O R E L L A N.
Young man ! thou wrong'ft Rivine.-

R O N A N.

Wou'd that thou

Who fay'ft I wrong her were a young man too,
And strong and valiant to defend her cause!
let me behold the trakt'refs, and confound
Her guilty foul.--

O R E L-

O R E L L AN.

Go, give thy pafion way,

Pursue and seize her in thy frantic arms;
Then throw her headlong from the airy cliff!
I kili'd the maid I lov'd; I thought her false,
But ihe was truth itself.

R ON AN.

And wedded too?

But who is he that durit invade my right ?
What is his name ? She fays Ihe was betray'd,
Who of mankind is he ?

O R E L L A N.

Her husband!
R O N A N.

Oh!

O R E L L A N.
The Pictih king.

R O N A N.

Durbian, my mortal foe !

The curfi oppressor of my native land !
From all mankind has she feleaed him,
Whom most my foul abhorr'd ?

ORELLAN.

She never chore:

She was betray'd, deluded, and compell'd.
Thy servant Valma, gain'd by Durifan's gold,
Deliver'd to Rivine a false message;
Cold and contemptuous, full of flight excuse,
For breach of faith confeft, and worst of all
Fraught with the praises of the beauteous queen,
Whose love had made thee lord of Erin's land.

7 R0N

RONA N.
Could she believe him ?

ORELLAN

The bold traitor swore,
That he was witness to the proud espousals.

ORELLAN.
How could Ihe doubt it ?

R O N A N.

Ha ! did {he not know me ?

Did not each a&ion of my life belie
The monstrous tale ?

R E L L AN.

Long before that, the flies

Resoundtd with the fame of thy great ads
In Erin's wars perform'd; and rumour spread
Abroad the story of the grateful queen.

R 0 N A N.
Where was my friend ?

ORELLAN.

When Durftan came to Elig,

Connan was absent in the distant isles;
His faith to thee this day of danger, proves.

RON AON.
This day !

ORELLAN.

The fraud of Durftan was detected,

And from presumption ifrong thy death believ'd;
Rivine, who till then conceal'd her anguilh

And
I,

And veil'd with sickly- smiles her broken heart,
Then own'd her love and publifh'd her despair.
With threats the Pi& requires his wedded wife:
Copnan defies him, and demands the combat.

R ON A N.

I knew he wou'd; my brave, my faithful friend!
But mine the cause, and mine shall be the combat,

ORELLAN.

The tribes are up in arms; for firong the host
That haughty Durftan leads.

R O N A N.

I have no arms,
The deep hath swallowed up my sword and lhield,

O R E L L A N.
Here is a sword.

R ON AN.
A sword ! It is my own.

Never more welcome to thy marfer's hand.
I'll trust thy temper tried. This on the shore
Didft thou not find ?

O R ELLA N.

Rivine brought it hither,
And bath'd it with her tears.

C O N N A N.

M Y friend is dead. But friendship never die!,
Remember, Sir, bow Ronan fought for me.
The youth were met in the fequefter'd vale,
And held a feast of joy. The bards arose,
And sung heroic deeds atchiev'd os.old.
Rous'd with the song the chiefs began to boast
Their own exploits in arms. Above the reft
Proud Armor vaunted, trussing in his strength;
Truth he regarded not; he told how once,
In Ardven's vale he met the blue-ey'd maid,
Old Alpine's daughter; Connan was her guard,
Who fhun'd the combat, and refign'd the maid.
Silent and pale my fad companions heard;
But from the banquet generous Ronan rose,
Anddar'd the giant to maintain his words,
By combat on the plain. Furious they met,
Like two strong bulls contending for the herd;
They fought from mid-day 'till the setting fun
Gilded the vale; then Ronan's arm prevail'd,
And Armor bit the ground. Fast by the lake,
Mark'd with a stone, is seen his lengthcn'd grave;

Eternal

Eternal monument of Ronan's faith
And of his glory; but of ihame to me,
If e'er my foul forgets the hero's love.

Ha! who comes yonder ruthing from the wood,
Swift as the roe ? fee at one bound he leaps
From bank to bank the brook. Connan, beware!
His ready weapon glitters in his hand.

Spirits of earth and air! 'tis Ronan's form!
Thus have I seen him haften to the field,
Thus spring exulting-when the foe drew near.

Borne on the wings of the careering winds,
But ne'er 'till now beheld-It stops and glares
With angry eyes on me. Speak thou, my son!

The times are so.-Sad tidings thou must hear.
But let resentment chafe thy grief away:
The salve of sorrow is a brave revenge.

For I have seen Rivine. Where is Durftan?

Of this delay. But why shou'd I defer

And I accuse thee; I defy thee too !

But, sift, I'll tell thee thy detested deeds,

To wrong his master's honour and his love;
And by the blackest artifice betray'd

And bear the cause of Albion on thy sword.

Impartial terms of peace. He who believes
His cause isjuft, will readily assent.

And wet his hoary head, with foam that flies

The coot, the cormorant are his companions.
Sometimes, he fays, his cries bring from her cloud
The pallid image of the murdered maid !

I know the fad Orellan. To what end
Dost thou describe to us the man of sorrow ?-

K A T H U L.

He is the judge who cannot be unjutt;
For his pure mind no partial paflion knows:
The sole affe5tion of his breast is pity;
The man of sorrow feels for human woes !
To him submit the cause of doubtful strife,
And let his voice determine of Rivine.

R O N A N.

Is this thy counsel, king ? and dost thou think
That it will be regarded ? Shall Rivine,
Like focks or herds in contest, be adjudged ?
No. Whiilit I live, Rivine mhal! be free;

That they obey in mine their king's command,

And lead them safely through the Piitifh host;

Not yet reveng'd and fee me meet your foe!

Euran ! whate'er the lavish Pia has promis'd
To tempt thee to betray thy matier's house,
Tenfold I'll give thee to preserve thy faith.
But let no man, not Kathul, Connan know;
The wrong is mine, and vengeance is my right..
The northern gate ! what is the appointed time
Of his approach ?

From the.fun's rising or his setting beams,
When o'er the castle, red Tonthena burns,-

They only shall behold the rough encounter.

And sent us forth, to flock, and fink together,

The equal combat. If thou doubt'ft thine arm

Amidf despair and death for Ronan mourns.-
'Tis not thy fault. Fortune has crofs'd our love,
But I wou'd rather be what now I am,
Than love thee less, or yet be less belov'd.

Belov'd thou art. I die, give me thy hand.-

O ! bel of men!
And best belov'd! farewel, farewel for ever! [

Flow fast my blood-why dost thou linger, deaith!
My heart is torn with agonizing thoughts.
0 ! memory would I could fly from thee!
And give my moments to a softer sorrow.-
Caught in an eddy, up and down the fiream

That monster there! that villain! land of ghofs !
Shall I forget it there ? [Dies.,

Alas! my lord!
Too true the traitor's words.

Enter C 0 N N A N with his warriors.

CONNAN.

Oh! Ronan ! Ronan!

O! my ill.fated filter! love of thee
Brought down the towering eagle of the war,
From his high rock of fame. Let me not blame,
Pity forbid that I should blame the duds
Of poor Rivine-Bear the bodies hence,
Let not old Kathul fee his daughter's blood :-
I left him standing by the corse of Euran.
O'erwhelm'd and dumb with grief.-

Enter KATHU L.

K A THUL.

I am the caufc

Of all that has befallen. Thy father's steps
Turn to his hall no more: deaf is mine ear
For ever to the voice of youth and joy.
Orellan's lonely cave shall hide my grief.
There we will dwell together and decay
Like two old trees, whose roots hang uppermost
On some bare mountain's fide, from which each storm
Wafteth a portion of the mould'ring foil
'Till down they fall.

L 2 CONNAN.

C O N N A N.

Do not indulge
Such melancholy thoughts.

KAT H UL.

I am refolv'd:

To thee, my son, the sceptre I resign;
I truf 'twill prosper in thy stedfast hand.
Thou wilt not liften to the tale of lies,
Nor in raih moos forsake thine antient friends.
Oh ! friend of Ronar ! be the peoples friend.
Still let thy open gate receive the stranger,
Who from the hill or from the lhip descends,
So shall thy name like grateful odour spread
From thy own dwelling to far distant lands.
have no other wish. My son farewel!

[Exit Kathu!.

CO N N A N.

To morrow we a monument Ihall raise
To mark the place where mighty Ronan refts
With fair Rivine, in the house of death.
If right my foul forebodes they shall not lie
In dark oblivion; on their buried woes
The light refulgent of the song shall rife
And brighten the fad tale to future times.
The brave, the fair shall give the pleasing tear
Of nature, partial to the woes of love.

# EPILOGUE.

E P I L 0 G U E.

Written by Mr. GARRICK.
Spoken by Mrs. ABINGTON.

[ Enters in a Hurry. J

ORGIVE my coming thus, our griefs.to utter-.
I'm fucb a figure !-and in such a flutter-.
circumftanc'd, in such an aukward way,
bnw not what to do, or what to fay.
Our bard, a firange unfaflaionable creature,
sobftinate as savage in his nature,
ill have no Epilogue!-I told the brute-
Sir, there trifles don't your genius suit;
have a working Prologue-fmith, within,
ill trike one off, as if it were a pin.
, Epilogues are Pins,-whofe points, well-plac'd,
ill trick your Muse out, in the tip-top taste !
Pins, madam! (frown'd the Bard) the Greeks us'd none,
(Thenmutt'ringGreek--fomethinglike this,--wenton)
Pinnos, painton, patcheros, non Graeco Modon."

x'd, he swore--" That tie him to a stake,
He'd susser all for Decency's fair fake;
loribery hlould make him change his plan."
e's an odd mortal. Match him if you can.
fir! (said I)-your reasoning is not deep,
hen at Tragedies fpeaators weep,

ft, like children, cry themf elves aleep.
f no jogging Epilogue you write,
Box, and Gallery, may sleep all night:
Like hamlefs infants mourn themselves asleep. ALEX.

' Better

Bt tp r . ,

" Better (he wore)-a nap ihould overtake yei

c Than Folly {hould to Folly's pranks awake ye;
cc Rakes are more harmless nodding upon benches,

Than ogling to insnare poor simple wenches;

c And funple girls had better close their eyes,

", Than fend 'en gadding after butterflies.
c Nay, Ihould a flatefman make a box his neRt;
cc Who, that his country loves, would break his reR!
cc Let come what may, I will not make 'em laugh,
"& Take for al Epilogu.-Tbis Epitaph.
c For as my lovers lives, I would not save,
cc No pois'nous weeds shall root upon their grave."
Tis thus there pedant Greek-read poets vapour-
Is it your pleasure I lhould read the paper ?

Here, in the arms of death, a matchless pair,
young-l'od hbero, and belovedfair,

No find repoft.,ir virtues tempefi-tof,
Sea-fck, and weary, reath the wi/'d-for coaf.p
?Watevet mortal to this spot is brought,
0 may the living, by the dead be taught!
M a hebre Ambition learn to lip her wing,
-nd yealoufy to blunt her deadly fling;
Tbhen Jball the Poet eJrny wiJb obtain,
Nror Ronan and Rivine die in vain.
