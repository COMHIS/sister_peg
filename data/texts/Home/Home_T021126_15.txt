AMPHARES.

They have. This morning, at the break of day,
The Spartin army charged AcHAIA's host.
This and no more is known. Suspense and fear
Pofifs the people; to the gates they run,
Then to their houses: the ffill whisper spreads
Thro'jultling multitudes the dread alarm.

SAD ANE.

Alas! revenge and empire now depend
O. the wild. iflue of unruly war.
.What if the2 arms of AGIS hould prevail?

'AMPHARES.

Although he should, the toils of fate surround him.
, .Da.ntles and firm our brave aflbciates fland,

And with impatience wait the defin'd hour
To rush on AGIs. This unlook'd-for battle
Is but a solemn prelude to the a&,
Which bold conspiracy will soon perform.
This day ihall terminate the reign of AGIS,
'And make, 0. Queen! all pow.cr in Sparta thine.

SANDANE.

I fee that danger only whets ;lie brave.
But yet, AMPHARES, if my lord is vanquili'd,
Will not the conquering army awe .the city?

AMPHAAREs.

AGIs- ail be the surety of our:.caue,
And hostage for our safety, till we wrest
The sword from proud.LYsANDER, if he conquers;
But that I fear not much. New to command- ..
From idle-Athens the mock hero comes,
Starts up a soldier, and.a tatefman too.;
Each palm he claims: All honours must adorn.
The chosen friend.of visionary AGIS.

SANDANE. ....... .'

Ma-y Mars direc&him so to guide the war,

A;MPHARES.: - '

This fa&tious tlate must change its feeble form, .
Waver no more beneath a double, reign
Of limited, contending, ufelefs.kings.
Henceforth our monarch lhall in Sparta rule,
As JOVE alone in high OLYMPUS reigns. -

-, *SANDANE.

So reign the mighty monarchs of the Ea'st;
And such imperial power, I thought, belongd
To Sparta's king, else I had ne'er been queen.
Young, and deceiv'd, I left my father's court
For Lacedemon's miserable sceptre.
I did endeavour to extend its fivay,
And to ambition rous'd my Spartan lord.
But the vain pupil of the Grecian schools,
Unprincely AGIS, matr'd' the brave defigh.
Chief of the multitude, idol and slave
Of the base populace, he led the herd,
He urged their brutal fuiy on the king.

AMPiiHAREs..

And now their fury on himself recoils.
Like the unruly elephant, they turn,
And trample down the ranks in which they fought.

SANDANE.
That is their Liberty.

AMPHTARES.
Let us employ,

And then suppress, such formidable licence,
AIy magiltracy now is near expir'd;
A king's resentment and a rival's hate
Have long hung over my devoted head:
Farewel to place,, to dignity, and power,
Whilst haughty AGIS fills the Spartan throne.
I will not live obscure in Lacedaemon,
Nor roam thro' Grecian flates a banifl'd man.'

If I muIftft, to rife and luine no more,
A fiery track hall. mark my setting fun.
But AGIS comes.

SANDANE.

And AGESISTRATA.

Farewel! Success attend thee, brave AMPHARES!
I will not fLay. My foul disdains to hide
Its hatred or its scorn. [Eit SANDANE.

AMPHARES.
Yet they who mean ,

To gratify these paflions, must conceal them.
This day decides my fate. So let it be,
Such brief conclusion have I ever lov'd.
Assist me, Hermes, God of stratagems,
With artful words, to tooth the mind of AGIs,
And turn him from the track my purpose holds.

Enter AGIS and AGESISTRATA.

AGEzsSTRATA.
Alas, my son! that bold bad man I dread!

AGIS..

He seems to wait us. At this hour, AMPHARES,
I think that thou of all men fhou'dft have ilunn'd me.

AMPHARES.

My motive in attending here your presence
Merits a less injurious falutaton.

AGIs.

I know thy merits, and I will rexard them.
Art thou not author of the woes of Sparta,
Prime mover and inflamer of sedition ?
Haft thou not bent the power of thy high office'
To the fubverion of the tfate thou ferv'ft?
At thee this day my, indignation burns.
i am dilhonour'd-

I :, .. - . - - . ~ ~ AM

- AMPHARES..

What has difhonbur'd thee?
Acrs. -

Thou and thy pratices: They have compell'd Mie
To leave the noblet station of a prince. . :
In time of war where fhodlld a king be found
But at his army's head? There Acss 'lood,
When you and your prefumptbous Ephori
Requir'd my presence here. Ungrateful Spartans!
Had you allow'd me but one other day,
Then had I fought this battle for my country,
And died or conquer'd with her braveft'fons.

AGE SI STRATA. .

Peril, my son! dwells not'in.camps alone:
In cities, palaces,,.and courts of justice,
With treachery and treason she inhabits,
Peril attended thus thou must encounter,
More'hideous sure than in the ranks of war.

AMPHARE S.

I know my actions have incens'd the king.
But I'imagin'd not that such suspicions .
Found entertainment in your royal breasts.

AGIS.

Haft thou not join'd the enemies of AGIS?
Thou who waft once his friend, inconstant man.

AMPHARES.

I have oppos'd the counsel of a foe,
Whose arts depriv'd nie of my prince's favour.

AGIS.

Thou halt oppos'd LYCURGUS and the laws,
Which raised the name of Sparta to- the Ikies.
The Delphic God infpir'd the deep design:
For more than human was that power of thought
Which join'd the public to the private good,
With iuch perfection, that each felfili paflion
Flow'd in the channel of the common welfare,

B 13 And

And dearest brothers, a great people liv'd.
In peace they liv'd without or strife or scorn,
In war they fought to conquer, or to die.
Equal and free, our happy'fathers knew
No interest but the inte'eft 0of the state;
No gain but Sparta's glory; proud they bore
That palm aloft, and shar'd the high refpe&,
The admiration, which conienting Greece
Paid to th' imperial virtue of their country.

AMPHARES.

Revolving time that system overthrew,
And chang'd the manners and the laws of Sparta.

AGIS.

The laws have been neglected, not annull'd
And corrupt rulers have corrupted manners.
Authority will soon revive the laws,
And great example yet restore the manners,
In spite of those who have opprefs'd their country,
Depriv'dthe people of their antient rights,
And while the nation funk beneath their sway,
Still strove for power in a declining kingdom,
Still fought for wealth in. an impoverilh'd land.
Even at this hour rapacious they perfit,
And, like some wretches in a franded veflel,
Plunder and riot in the midst of ruin.

AMPHARES.

MIov'd by the present perils of the state,
This signal hour I chose, unknown as yet
The fortune of the field, to change my conduct,
And make an offer of my aid to AGIs.

AGIS.

If I should judge the future by the past,
Thou must forgive me, tho' I doubt thy faith.

AcE-

:AGESISTRAT.A.

Yet hear him, Agis: in an hour like this -
He who affiflance offers is a friend.

AGI.S!.

This hour may yet deceive'their country's foes..
I know the base foundation of that hope ,
Which makes my baffled enemies presume.
LYSANDER'S army in its iranks conitains
The best and bravest of Laconia's'fons;
The faction wilh and hope defeat to them, ' '
That Sparta's generous youth may ne'er return
To guard that freedom .which has made them brave.

'"' AMPHAREG.

The boldness of their hopes their deeds will prove
In the assembly, if Achaia conquer.

AoGESISTRATA. ' " '
AMPHARES, fay, what is their utmost aim ? -- ..

.AMP'HAR-ES .. . ::

The old &pendants of the exilPd king, · :
And all the venal members of the Rate,
Won by SANDANE'S arts and foreign gold;
Aim to restore LEGNIDAS, Who tomes,
With holtile; armies to enflave-his' country:
Therefore SAN.OANDS' proffers I t:ejeded,
Have warn'd the king, and- ould-have-ferv'd him fobt
But since resentment' and distrust 'prevent me,
Neutral I. stand; and wvill not seek that welcome ' ':".'
Which his more: artful.enemies would give.

AGIS.

Thou fpeak'iE more-boldly than becomes AMPHARES.
Add that to the offences I forgive.
It is the sacred maxim.of rnmyreign,
That in a prince's consecrated b:eaf'
Revenge and anger ihould-not long remain.
These passions in a king affli& the-ftate,
By driving rash offenders todefpair. ' ''

This

This day decides your character with me.
Now let your aLlions prove your words sincere..

AM'PHARES.

No other terms I ak, and fureI am
Ne'er hall AMPHARES need again forgiveness.

[Exit AMPHARES,
Mlnetit AGIS aid AGESISTRATA.

AGIS.

Well has he judgd the season of fubmifilon.
He will aftift asif LYSANDER conquers.

AGESISTRATA.

May Jove avert the evils which I fear!
I dread the ruin of the Spartan Rtate,
And fear the downfal of our antient hbufe,
The blackest fury of the Stygian realm,
The molt deftrunivei is infernal Discord.
Bath'd in the blood of kings Ihe walks this world,
And tumbles itates and empires to the ground.

At;Is.

Nations oft perish by their princes crime;
But now if Sparta's antient state muit fall,
Gods and good men shall witpefs for-its king,
That hewith fate contended for his people,
And on the ruins of their virtue fell.

AGESISTRATA.

Think not I mean to blame your high. design,
Age has not chang'd the tenor of my mind,
Nor pall'd my admiration of true glory.
Sprung, like thy father, from Alcides' blood,
Ifeel the spirit of the Spartan line.
Only let me adjure thee to beware
And walk with caution thro' surrounding perils.
Tha' thou defpifeft every form of danger,
Think what a helpless train attends on thee,
An aged mother, and an infant son.

AGIS.

AGISJ .
Divine Alcides will protecI his .ace.

-AGESISTRATA.

I will invoke: the. God; in times like 'these
players are the arns of our defenceless fe.
A spotless choir of matrons and;of virgins,
Who o'er their country mourn, myself will lead
To the high temple of the son' of Jove.
He yet may hear the voice of fipplication,
And stretch his arm to save the Spartan itate.

[Exit AGESISTRATA.

AGIS: -alole.

Without, theenemy; within, the fation,
What Ihou'd 1 think? .I have a thousand thbughts
That rife and fall like Wvaves,upon the fliore.
Ineed thee now, LYSANDER! O my friend
I lean on thee, and thou perhaps art fall'n.
Ye ever-living gods, who know my heart,
I trullin you,, for righteous are my thoughts,
All bent on.raifing up long-proftrate Sparta.
With Sparta too, I w6uld be proud to rife,
And gain fuclh glory as my fathers gain'd,
When Persia's tyrant trembled at their arms.
If in this just ambition I should perilh,
My name flall go to nations yet unborn.
But I multfchange .my strain: EUANTHE comes.
Alas, LYSANDER, led by love aid thee,
She left her Athens for this land'of broils.

' Enter EUANT1 HE.

. . . EUANTHE.
No tidings from the camp?

AGIS. ;'

None, fair EUANTHE.

Ere this had reach'd our gates.

EUANTHE..

Oh! many a dame,

Matron and virgin, tremble at this hour
But who has canre like mine ? The most forlorn
And desolate of women is EUANTHE !
If

AGIS.

Small the chance of what EUANTHE fears:

In the long wars of till-contending Greece
Leaders of armies have but rarely fallen.

EUANTHE.

One thing I know, and with prophetic tongue
I speak it, Prince! if Sparta triumph not,
Ne'er ihall your eyes again behold LYSAND-ER.
Difidain in him is fatal as despair.

AGIS.

When he returns vicorious from the field,
Then ihall he hear who belt has'fpoke his praise.
But I must leave you now: The senate- waits me.
Hereafter we liall speak of this, and smile
Like mariners who on the peaceful shore
Sit, and with pleafture talk of tempests past.

[E.xit AGM.

EUANTHE 0alone.

This itedfaft ease is all aftum'd, I fee;
He taggers at the imminent event.
How dreadful is this interval to me,
Who am bereft and destitute of all
Those aids that flay affliCtion; and must bear
The weight of woe that's heavier every hour.
The queen, and generous AGIS too, discharge
The dues of kindred with unfeigned love.
But our acquaintance is not old enough
To yield a ripen'd sympathy, whose taste '
Alone can comfort such a mind as mine.

Yet

Yet I repent me riot in this extreme,
That I forsook my country and my friends.
They would have forc'd me.to a loathed bed,
And torn. me from the noblest of mankind. -
If he should fall! my love.! my only love!
Shall I survive thee; and return to Athens,
Be humbled there before my haughty kindred,
And hear them blame the ashes of LYSANDER ?
Forbid jt, fearless love! forbid it, Ihame i
Forbid it, honour, and my nature's pride;
Death flall forbidit, for I dare to die.

Lament old men, who drink the bitter di'crs
Of life and woe, and in decrepit age

Nay even the heavy ox, the stubborn 'mulei
Dullest of beasts, they know the hand that feeds them.

LYSANDER.

Humanity lives in thy. breast, 0 king!
And dictates confidence unlimited;
Virtue approves the generous extreme,
And magnanimity this error loves.
Let private men indulge the glorious fault,
And set their lives and fortunes on the faith
And gratitude of those they have oblig'd;
But let feverer prudence. guard the heart
Of him whose brows are.circled with a crown.

Enter an OFFICER.

OFFICER.

O King ! the captain of Amycla's gate
Informs you. that he has this hour descried
A band of men who halted near his post;
A thousand Thracians, they report themselves,
Hir'd by AMPHARES for SELEUCUS' service.

AGIS.-
A thousand Thracians!

OFFICER.
'On their march to Sardis.
LYSANDER.
By whose permission do they march this way ?

OFFICER. '

Before the troops arriv'd, a herald came
Who to the Ephori a medage bore.

AGIS.
Your diligence in duty I commend.

Exit OFFICER.

LYSANDER.
The veil's withdrawn, and treason rtands revcal'd.

Ne'er

Ne'er Ihall AMPHARxES need again forgivenef,
With what:a double tongue the traitor soke !
All-feeing Gods! how little do we knowv
The greatness of those blessings you confer-,
Had we not fought to day, had we not conquer'd,
AGcs and Sparta had been loft for ever.

AGIS.

This vi&ory came like the bolt of Jove,
And leyell'd their designs.

LYSANDER.

Yet if they dare

The worit of crimes, their treason may succeed.
Your troops, your conquering troops, are not arriv'd;
Th' aflembly meets I unguarded there you lta nd;
What keeps the traitors from your noble life?

AGIS.

Mylife! LYSANDER. No, I fear not that.
The antient aunnls of this land record,
That barbarous foes revere the race divine,
And turn in battle from a Spartan king.

LYSANDER

The multitude may fll revere their lord
Who from the blood of great Alei4es springs;
And yet some impious hand may strike the prince,
Altho' of virtue as of race divine.

AGIS.

I'11 change the guards, and place at ev'ry gate
Some men of trust.

LYSANDER.

Mount your Theflalian steed,

And meet the troops that haften to your aid.
With eager steps the royal band advance,
And with for nothing but their king to.lead them.
Then if the furies in their wrath provoke
Your foes to rife in aris, let.arms decide.

Ne'er

Ne'er were. the good-and bad .winow'd:fo well, : :
And fever'd from each other..: Such the. hosts,
And such will. be their.fate, as when .the rage-
Of earth-born giants dar'd. the foils of heaven.

Thy fears are all for me, mine for my people.

Hail, gallant RHESUs! know'ft thou'ought of those
Thy countrymen, who thus unlook'd.for come,
And in a doubtful hour perplex our councils.

'RHES S.

The Thracians are a thpufand men compleat.
From fiowy Hemus and the northern hills
Of wild Odryfus the fierce warriors come,
RHINALCES leads them, of illustrious birth;
But, Item, imperious, and grown old in arms,
He knows no umpire but tihe sword; no law
Except obedience to the prince he serves.

AGIS.

Such oft are those that quit a needy home
To serve as hirelings in a tyrant's holt.

RHESUS.

Next in command, my brother Euxus flands,
A Youth to MARS devoted; for he loves
Danger itself, not dallger's rich reward.

LYSANDER.
Haft thou yet seen him? - -

RHESUS.
No.
LYSANDER.

Has he yet heard
That thou art here in Sparta? -

RHsESUS.

He believes

'1he

That I-ai till in Athens. From the herald
I kept my name and quality conceal'd; .
For I fufpelted that these Thracian troops,
Though hir'd for Asia, were for Sparta meant.
If it prove so, I may be pjfful here:
My valiant brother bears a generous mind,
And, tho of arms enairmai'd, justice loves,

AGIS.

Hate to your valiant brother, and explain,
With an impartial tongue, the state of Sparta.
Shew him where justice, and where honour stand.
If these are sacred, as thou fay'ft they are,
To gallant Euxus, he may prove a friend.

LYSAKDER.

Exert the ftroig persuasion of a brother;
And tell him, RHESUS, if he loves bright arms,
And that immortal glory valour gains,
No more to wield a mercenary sword,;
But plant himself with thee in Sparra's'foil,
Where AGIS will his noble nature cherilh,
And rear his courage to such lofty deeds,
As antient ftorytells of Sparta's chiefs. lExit RaHEsus

AGIS.

I hope that RHEsus will divide the Thracians:
This favours well the biass of my mind,
Averse to leave the city on suspicion,
And drive the wavering fa&ion to extremes.

LYSANDER.

0 generous prince! whom I admire and blame,
The greatest foe, the foe LYSANDER dreads
Is the unequali'd gentleness of Acis.
Review the story of the Grecian flates,
And mark how freedom fell in every land.

The

The brave asserters of the pulic cause- . '
Have ever been too mild in evil times;
Have, like indulgent parents, fpar'd'the rod,
And let the vices of their children live
'To kill the virtues. Hence, let AcIs learn
The only lefon-that his nature .,eeds. -

AGIS.

Uncertain is the peril if I ifay,
But certain is the evil ifI fly.
I will remain; but to assure my safety,
You mult, LYSANDER, to the troops return.

LYSANDE.R

And leave my prince alone amidit his foes !
Revoke the hard command if you're refolv'd
To brave the peril, then my place I claim
Next to your person; by your fide I Itand;
Perhaps some noble.fervice I may render,
Receive the mortal wound aim'd at my prince,
And with my life, redeem the life of Acis. -

AeIs.'

Your great imagination's up in arms;
But hear me, and let calmer reason judge.
I am determin'd not to quit the city,
The guilt of civil wvar fiall not be mine.
LYSANDER'S presence here without the troops
Would but embolden and excite my foes,
Who may be tempted by this fair occasion,
This mighty vantage, to furprize us both.
Without delay, once more, LYSANDER, arm,
And oltentatioufly pass through the gate.
This viceory, and the approaching hoi
Will hufli the threatned itorm..

LYSANDER. - -

So may it prove.

But.

But there is fomethinog in my heart rebels
Against this'counfel! Oh!. I cannot leave you--
Nor ought I now to flay. Let never man
Say in the morning that the day's his own:
Things past belong to memory alone
Things future are the property of hope,
The narrow line; the Isthmus of these seas,
The instant scarce divisible, is all
That mortals have to stand on. O my prince I
LYSANDER leaves you with a heavy heart.

AGtS.

Farewel, thou Spartan of the antient mould,
Dear as the brother of his blood to AGIS !

- They embrace and part,
LYSANDER!

LYSANDERL
Ha may heaven your purpose change!

AGIS.

My will is six'd. But though my judgment ton
Confirms the secret counsel of my heart,
Yet I maybe deceiv'd; perhaps, my friend,.
We part this moment ne'er to meet again.

LYSANDER.

Let us not partt a all; is inspiration,
The guardian God, the Demon of the mind,
Thus often presses on the human breast.

AGIS.

alitake me not, I feel DO new impression,

Nor if I did, {hould I by that be alter'd;
For such presages, be they fad or joyful, .
I deem them but the meteors of the mind,
Bred by the inward elemental firife,
When great events perplex and shake the fo9ul
My thoughts regard the slate. If I ihould fall,
To thee, LYSANDER, I commit my son,
The only pledge of my DEIDAMIA'S love.

Trlin

Train up the boy to walk in the fame path
Which we have trod together, the ftreight path
Of virtud and true glory. If he proves
Of noble nature, and I hope.no les,
He will not flhun the lofty path .of honour,
Tho' fate ihould mairk it with his father's blood.

LYSANDER.

Hear this, immortal Gods! who rule the'world,
And guard a prince the image of yourselves !
0 never, never may his royal iace
LYSANDER'S aid require. - [Exit LYSANDER,

AGIS alone.

Affeclion choaks his words, '

His generous heart bursts at this filemn parting.
In times like these of a-declining state,
Baseness infeds the general race of men;
'But yet these trying times rear up a few
More excellent, refin'd and conscious spirits,
Mlore principled, and fit for all events,
Than any in the good, but equal, mass
Of a far better age. Such is LYSANDER. '

Thou hafl prevail'd,: becaife the generous AGIS
Would not believe there could be such a traitor.

AMPHARES.

Oft have I heard, and often seen thy folly,
But now to rail is madness. With one word
I could impose on thee eternal silence.

YSANDER,

And would-I know thee-if thou thought'ft it wife.
Even then, as now, I Ihoul contemni thy power:

But

But know, I fear thee nor. The king is fafM,
And his viCtorious troop at break of day
Will thunder in thine ears: thou and thy ban,
Will ill sustain the ihock of such an host.
My life is in thy hands, but yet beware,
Thy fate depends on mine. In Lacedaemon
A prince like AGIs soon will find LvsANDtRs.

And can the Gods permit the fall of AGIS?

They can. Tis map's own arrogance arrays him
In gorgeous titles of excelling nature,
Care of the Gods, and centre of creation.

His foul a subtile essence of the blood,
A rainbow beauty, made to lhine a space,
'Then melt and vanish into air.

Brighter than all the tars that deck the heavens,
Is your celetial fire for ever quench'd,
And nought but .ales left, the sport of chance,
Which veering winds itill blpm about the world?

Forgive these tears, my country! Acis weeps
For thee. Alas! thy brave defender's gon! '
O Lacedamon, thou art fallen for ever!
Thy bad estate ihall every day grow worse;
Successive tyrants shall exhaust thy ifrength,
Till all thy generous youths have bled in vain
At last the consummation of thy woes
Shall come upon thee; some ambitious foe
Shall stretch the'iron arm of conquefL forth,
- And grasp thee in the circle of his empire. *

My native land, the kingdom of my fathers,
Shall be no more a nation! O my country,
How irretrievable is thy condition! .
Tfie Macedonian vulture hboers o'er thee,
Soon to descend, and on thy vitals prey.

AMPHARES.

Thou may'st delay, perhaps avoid, thy death,
Send forth thy mandate to the royal band,
To halt till further orders,

AGIS.

Ha! No more

I trust thee, traitor. Would I had ever bees
Thus deaf to thee No, let the oyal band
Revenge their gallant leader and their king.

First EPHORE.
Thou tempt'ft thy fate,

AGIS,
I scorn it, Since my hope-

Of Sparta's los, and my beloved friend
Has perilh'd in my cause, why mhould I live?

In

In any period of my former days
I rather would have chose to die attempting
The glorious design, which you have ruin'd,
Than live the prince of a degenerate. people,
The tame fpeaator of a falling empire.

First EPHORE.
To Reason hearken,

AGIS.

.Reason bids.me die,

As I have liv'd, unalter'd in my love
To Sparta, and unconquer'd. in'my.purpofe
You mean to take advantage of my tfate,
Without fpetator, counsellor, or friend:
You think I dread the:itemn approach: of death,
Because the blooming season of my life
Still promises a long extent of years: .
But my forefathers blood is in my veins,
The blood of heroes, and of Spartan kings,
Less only than the Gods. I dare your worit,
And with my dying breath acqui: my people.. :
The people role; they hearken'd to the voice
Of Liberty, and blest the name of AGIS.
But you, the nobles, an inglorious race,
Base as the dastard and unarmed Helots,
With foreign arms and .mercenary aid,
Bore down the people and oppref your prince,
Whom death delivers. 'AGIS shall not fee
The last convulsions of expiring Freedom,
For in the first he dies,

To the fame turret where AMPHARES' troops
Guarded the queen, whose mantle on the grouiii;
She spied, and wrapt it round her wretched h ead;
When suddenly a Itern affaflin came,
And flabb'd her, as that queen whose robe ic wore
Arriving then, I heard her thriek for help,
Implore her country's Gods, with bitter cries,
And, in her agony, divulge her crimes.
It was no wonder that she sear'd to die.

For whom I mourn, Untimely was his fate;
Yet full of high and pleasing thoughts he fell.
