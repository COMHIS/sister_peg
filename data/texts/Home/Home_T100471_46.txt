Spoken by Mr. GA t R c K.

TWlT HEN Philip's son ledforth his warlike band,
VV o die, or conquer, in a distant land;
To fan the fire, a martial muse e chose;
From Homer's song a new Achilles tofe I
When generous Athens her prime trophies won,
Fanquiyh'd Darius, and Darius' [on,
The stage breath'd wa---thefoldiers bosom burn'd,
Andfiercer to thefield each chief return'd:
Now, when the world resounds with loud alarms, s
When vifooy fits plan'd on Britain's arms,
Be war our theme: the hero's glorious toil,
And virtue springing from the iron foil!
Ourfcenesprefent afiege in flory known;
Where magnanimity, and valour Jhone:
If nature guides us, if the hand of truth
Draws the juJf portrait of a Roman youth,
tho, with the heft andnoblefi pajionsfir'd,
In the fame moment, conquer'd and expir'ld
Perhaps your hearts may own the pidur'd woe,
And from a fonder fourceyourforrows flow:
Whilf/ warm reviem brance aids the poet's f/rain,
And England weeps for EngliJh heroes slain.

SiegeofAQu LLEIA.

A
TRAGEDY.

A CT. I. SCENE I.

Tfhe Palace Court.

Enier PAULUS and TITUS.
THI S is no time to strive for vain renown.

The fate of Rome, remember that, my brother !
Depends on the defence of Aquileia.

Ti TUS.
PAULUS, I know.

PAULUS.

But thou dost not confider
Th' importance of this war. We fight not now,

A3 A3

As oft since Freedom fell our fathers fought,
When Latian chiefs contended who ihould reign,
With half the senate lifted on each fide-
The viaor frill was Roman, and rever'd
The gods and temples of. immortal Rome.
But o'er yon mighty holt, that girds our walls,
Fierce MAXIIM r commands: whether of Thrace,
Or wild Dalmatia, so obscure his birth,
Himfeif scarce knows; but sure Barbarian born.
This savage soldier, nurs'd in blood and war,
Whom military frenzy hath set up
To trample on mankind, abhors a Roman;
And marks for death the noble and the brave.
His yoke, at last, th' indignant senate scorns,
The flumb';ing Genius of our country wakes,
And rouses slothful Italy to arms.
The furious tyrant from the frontier haftes,
Like a wild beast gall'd by thehunter's spear;
And, breathing vengeance, rushes upon Rome.:
Here firin oppos'd, tenfold his fury burns;
Here, in the pars offate, our father stands,
Defies and flops the monster in his rage,
I ill Rome's last legions come to give him battle.
Now, when a soldier's lifeis offuch momentr-
WV hen destiny hangs on a single day,
To fight for glory, TITUS, were a crime.

TITUS.

No, PAULUS, no ! it is not fame alone
That TITUS seeks to pi-rchafe from the foe;
Tho' such a crime the .gods and:men would pardon.
I !-iow the peril that o'er Rome impends,
A.2d k'ow the hated cause of all our ills,
That army, only brave against their country,
I mean to fiite them, and their giant leader,
Whom nature for a gladiator form'd,
To be the sport, and not the lord, of Rome.
The blow once struck, our foe must raise the siege,
Or -wate his veterans in vain attacks,
And give to GORD I A N us easy conquest.

PAULUS.
Were this a frontier ciy far from Rome,

:And

And yon huge host compos'd of foes remote,
German, or Parthian; I'would fay to thee,
Lead on, my brother ! Shield to shield we'd go,
And fire yon turret, or together perilh.
But now when conquest by delay is gain'd,
When Aquileia guards the walls of Rome,
Dread of the great event has so possess'd me,
That, like the Persian soldier, I could stay
My arm uplifted, patient to the call
Of cautious Duty.

TITUS.

And renouncing fame ?

Oh ! PAULUS ! you have gain'd longfincethe prize
That I contend for. Every martial palm
Thy sword hath won. When I, like thee, am great
In deeds of arms, like thee I may be wary.
Now to my brother I lay bare my breast:
This famous siege approaches to its end;
Whatever end the ruling gods ordain,
Yet no diftinguilh'd aation graces me.
I've done my duty. That I reckon nothing;
.The meanest soldier has not ihrunk from duty;
Son of. EMILIus, and thy brother, PAULUS;!
I mufl do more, and by the gods I will ! .:
Here I have found a path that leads to glory
Do not oppose me, elfle-we're friends no more.-
Our father comes. Speak not against my purpose,
And I lhall move the consul's noble mind.

Enter aMILIUS.

EAMILIUS.
Health to my sons!

PAULUS and Tirus.

Heaven guard our father's life!
- AMILIUS.

And bless my children ! ha! your looks are keen.
Your's chiefly, TITUS ! what hath stirr'd your' spirit ?
How points the enemy ? This quiet night,
In preparation past, portendsa storm.

PAULUS.
On that attack which threats the eastern gate

The

The enemy hath labour'd all night long,
Repairing what the river's rage had ruin'd.

J.MILIUS.

It was a friendly flood. The river god
With all his waters guards his native walls;
On that strong quarter they can ne'er prevail.
The north I fear, where yon tfupendous tower
Our works commands.

TITUS.

It lhall not long command,
Let but the consul grant me my desire.

-EM) LIUS.
What would my son ?

TITUs.

Their tower is weakly guarded.

At break of day, a soldier from yon camp
Fled to my pot ; hollow and gaunt he was;
His ihrivell'd limbs scarce bore his founding'arms.
Like him, he said, with toil and famine worn,
Were halfthe tyrant's host. For MAXIMIN,
Mad with delay, and fiercer from repulse,
Reviles his soldiers, drives them to the trench
With whips and Iharp reproach. This day, o'ercome
By strong necefiity, he breathes a while,
And fends his legions forth, to gather in
Whatever this exhausted region yields.
I saw the bulv foragers in troops
MAarch, and difoerfe themselves on every fide,
Like playful children on a summer day,
Secure and caielefs ; .for no martial band
Of late hath sallied from our guarded gates.
This is the time. Permit me, O my father!
Nowv to attack their ill defended lines,
And fire that mighty tower in which they trust.

AEMILIUS.

Well hai thou fp oke, my son! thy zeal I love,
Nor muse thy flill and judgment pass unprais'd.
Be thus attentive still, and trust me, TITUS,
In future sieges, and in other wars,
Swift execution fhail -thy purpose honour.

TITUs.

TiTtTs.

Ne'er Ihall I fee another liege like this,
Ne'er draw my sword in such a glorious cause.
Alas ! my lord! check not my spring of thought,
Nor nip the only bud it yet has borne.

EMIILI US.

Riper occasions will thy valour claim.
Danger comes on Typheus-like it comes,
Whose fabled flature every hour encreas'd.

TItus.

0! judge not of the counfelby the-weight
Of him that gives it. Would to heaven, my lord I
That I could now divest me of that youth
Which mars my credit. Chearfully I'd ftep
Far into age, to gain but for a day
The grave authority which years bestow.

PAULUs.
What brings the brave Numidian GARTHA hither?

Enter GARTHA.

GARTHA.
Hail to the general !

£.MILIUS.

Hail, valiant GARTHA.
How has the morning past where you command ?

GARTHA.

It has been busy. The presumptuous foe
In loose diforder'd squadrons rang'd the fields.
I watch'd the time; and sudden as the blafti
That rites in the defart, out we rulh'd
And swept them from the plain. Safe in our speed
We urg'd the chace far as the rising ground,
And unmolested view'd the camp below.
This worthy of your notice I obferv'd,
Their wond'rous tower,, the work of many a day,
Stands now proteced by a feeble guard.

TITUS.

Thanks for thy welcome tidings, noble GARTHA !
The guardian gods of Roine bend from their Ikies,
And point this action out. Hear me, my father !'

If

If ever since my birth I gave thee joy,
If e'er thou did'ft, as parents oft are wont,
Interpret large the promise of my childhood,
O hear and grant my chiefand dear request!
Let me go forth: be this my first exploit,
To wrap in fire the tyrant's boaffted tower
That Rome, who glories in the AEmilian line,
May join your TITus to his kindred names !

.EMILIUS.

In thee the spirit of thy fathers speak,
Or some superior power thy bofoni fires,
Whom I oppose no more. Go, and fulfil
Thy destiny. Brave GARTHA too thall add
His troops to thine. Prepare what else

TITUS.

'Tis done.

DeflruEive instruments and balls of fire
Are ready at the gate.

'ErLius.

Farewel, my son.!

If you prevail, urge not too far your fortune.
Remember fill my words; that when we meet,
I may have cause to praise thy condut then,
As now thy courage, Ti TUS.

TITUS.'
GARTHA, come!
[Exeunt TITUS and GARTrA.

_EMILIUS.

PAULUS, lead thou thy legion to the gate,
And favour their retreat. It may be needful;
But mix not in the fight, for mighty cities
Have been by such temerity furpriz'd.

PAULUS.

Would there was no Roman breast more prone
To ralh attempts, than mine! I with, my lord,
That I had led, and Trrus had fuftain'd me.

Enter an OFFICER.

OFFICER.
Consul of Rome! this arrow, thusinfcrib'd,

Fell

Fell on the green flop'd bank fast by my pofl;
And as it bears your name, myfelfhave brought it.

[2EMILIUS readi.

In three days hence, even with the ides of June,

"TheRoman army comes to your relief
"Be sparing of your troops; protra6t the siege;

Thou art the ihield of Rome and GORDIANUS."

A. AMILUS.

Soldier, return, and publish to the legions
The welcome tidings of a near relief.

OFFICER.

Gladly, my lord. Much have the troops endur'd,
And with unlhaken constancy they susser.

[Exit OFF CER.

PAULUS.

Had this advice arriv'd ere TI TUS went,
I think he hardly had obtain'd permilfion.
Tho' MAX IM N should raise an hundred towers,
And, like the Giants when they warr'd with Jove,
Pile mountains on each other, high as heaven,
For three ihort days his fury we may scorn.

]EMILIUS.

Go, and prevent the rally. Tell thy brother,
What the imperial mandate here contains;
It is the emperor's command recalls him.

PAULUS.
With pleasure I obey.

IExit PAULUS.
2EMILI us alone.

I muf reserve

My tons, my soldiers, for a nobler service,
And in the battle aid the Roman arms.
The hour approaches that muf .give to Rome
A legal lord, by her own suffrage chosen,
Or fix a barb'rous matler o'er mankind,
That barb'rous maiter I lhall never own:
If I could lfoop to drag the servile chain,
And live the vassal ofa vile Dalmatian,
Yet 1 could not conceal me n the croud
Of prostrate Romans; I that ftood'aloft,
And bore thro' Italy the senate's itandard.

Fast

Fast by that standard will I plant my foot,
There with my boys a glorious conquest gain,
Or end at once the long _Emiliai line.

[CORNELIA appetars

Behold the only objet that-can shake
One moment my resolve! What will become
Of thee, CORNELIA ! doom'd perhaps to live,
Like PRIAM'S wretched queen, the slave of those
By whom her sons, her husband, country'fell.:

. , .
Enter CORNELIA and PRIEST.

CORNELIA.
Why is my lord alone ?. Where aremy sons ?

%EMILIUS. '

This day, CORNELIA, brings us welcome tidings,
The Emperor approaches with his his oft. :

CORNELIA.
Thanks to the gods! -But fay, where are my children ?

EMILIA.
This instant I expeEt them to return.

CORNELIA.
From whence, ./EMILIUS ?

JEMILIUS.

From the northern gate.

TITUS had form'd a brave, a great design;
But when afiurance of relief arriv'd, .
My PAULUs halten'd to recal his brother.

- CORNELIA.

'Tis as I sear'd. PAULUS will come too late.
The omens of the gods muft-be fulfil'd.

J2EMILI US.
What evil omens has CORNELIA seen ?

CORNELIA.

Tis strange to tell; -but as I flumb'ring lay,
About that hour when glad Aurora springs,
To chace the lagging tiades, methought I was
In Rome, and full of peace the city feem'd.
My mind oblivious too had loft it's care.

Serene

Serene I ftep'd along the lofty hall,
Imbellifh'd with the. ftatuesof our- fathers,
When suddenly aniuniverfal-groan
Issued at once from every marble'breafb.
Aghall I gaz'd; around.t when flbwlydown
From their high pedeftals-I saw descend
Themurde'd GGRAecHir. Hand in, hand, thebrothers
Stalk'd towards me.: .As. they approach'd ilore near,.
They were no. more'the OaAeCHir , buc my sons
PAULUS and T T US.. -At that dreadful change
I fhriek'd and wak'd.' Bit:never from my minhd
The -fpetacle shall part. Their rueful eyes!:
Their cheeks of stone ! the look of death and woe 1
So strange a vision ne'er from fancy rose.
The reft, my lord! this holy Priest can tell.

P~Mrjmus. S.MIEIUS.

Why this is nothing but a common dream;
For often whrenithe waking .mind:isceharg'd
With apprelierfion- of uncertain. ills,
Imagination, in the hour of reft,.-
Prefenteth wild fntaftie combinations,
That have a shade and. tinture of the pas-:
But 'tis the weakness of the human mind
That joins the vain assemblage to futurity.

PRIEST..

Men reason thus, my lord! who think their reason
Can grasp and mearire.all; presumptuous thought!
Sounds more than human' have been often heard,
And ihapes celestial ieen, by mortal man
But yet most freqienq t in the silent night
Are warnings given by strange portentuous dreams..
The history of mighty Rome aboinds
In awful instances. The old republic
By them has oft been fway'd; and oft preferv'd.

EMILIUS.

But tell me, Priest of JoVE ! what do the gods
By their more certain omens now declare?

PRIEST.

Consul! with the most venerable rites
That our religion knows, I have perform'd

'B Afacri-

A sacrifice to Capitolian JOVE,
This pious matron present: never yet
Since at the altars of the gods I stood
Did I behold such omens of calamity.
Yet they were intricate, ambiguous, dark;
And tho' some parts I might interpret fair,
Even these were mix'd and full of dire perplexity..
No further can I fee into the cloud,.
That veils the will of heaven; but this I fay,
And by the scepter of the god I serve
It is the truth: Some dreadful danger hangs
O'er thee thyself, this city, or thy race. . (Sout.

CORNELIA.
Ha! what means that shout ?

2EMILIUS.

It is a joyful ihout.

Behold the cause: fee where that dulky smoke
Darkens the air. And now the flame bursts but;
Their turret blazes, and my T Tus conquers.

CORNELIA.

O heaven and earth! 0 son too well belov'd!
Why do these cruel omens check myjoy?

Enter an OFFICER.

OFF I CER.

Consul! your valiant son hath sir'd the tower;
But whilt he urg'd too far the flying foe,
A band, that lay conceal'd beyond the height,
Has gain'd the plain between him and the city.

A^MILIUS.

O raffly brave! whom I forewarn'd in vain.-
Retire, CORNELIA, yet he may be refcu'd.
Lucius.

Enter

Enter another OFFICER.

Luc ius.

The northern gate unguarded stands:
.For when brave PAULUS saw his brother's peril,
He with his legion rulh'd upon the foe,
And furious is the fight.

CORNELIA.
Both, both are loft !

1EMILIUS.

Unhappy youths! My steady PAULUS too'!
Where is our discipline, obedience where ?-
I have no leisure now for words, CORNEI A !
Implore the gods to guard you and your children.

[Exit with his attendants.
Manent CORNELIA, and PRIEST.

CORNELIA.

Perhaps ere this CORNELIA has no children I
They both are fallen into the fatal snare.
Tremendous oracle! too late reveal'd.

PRIEST.

Abandon not thy foul to such despair;
The sword of war, devouring as it is,
Consumes not all. The dettin'd number die,
And from the bloodiest field still some return.

CORNELIA.

My sons will ne'er return, I know them well.
The noble heart of Tt TUS, if he lives,
This inhtant swells with grief, and pride, and lhame,
Will he, the author of this fatal combat,
Forsake the soldiers whom he led to slaughter;
Return discomfited, and fav'd by flight,
To bear reproach, and blulh in Aquileia ?
He will not, holy Flamen! Nor will PAULUS:
Calm as he is, and master of himself,

B 2 My

My generous PAULus will not leave his brother.
Alas! I never thall behold them more.
This is the evil' that the gods foretold.
Ye constant matrons of Rome's former days!
Alas! I have no fortitude like yours.
Mine were no publick cares. In the mild shade
Of sweet domestic happiness I liv'd,
Till this fierce tempest rose, the storm of-war,
Whose rage hath burfl on the 2Emilian race.

PRIEST.

Lady, retire. I to the walls will go,
And learn what has befallen. Remember thou,
How oft, in human life, the great conclusion
Of sear'd and wih'd events mocks all conjeCure.

Lucius.
CORNELIA comes, impatient of thy flay.

PRIEST.

How shall my tongue perform a faithful office,
And tell CORkELIA what my eyes beheld?
Her sons I saw surrounded by the foe;
And their 'fllall troops feem'd like a bank of sand,
Which, by the flowing tide encompafs'd round,
Each moment waftes and lessens to the view.
Their wretched father saw, and could not save them.
For full oppos'd to him the tyrant Rood
With half his host embattled. Thrice iEMIrLIus
Came to the front of his remaining troops,
As if he meant to ruih upon the foe,
And thrice the consul pull'd the father back:
Then looking down and leaning on his sword,
The tears fall trickling down the warrior's cheek.,
He paus'd a while, and turn'd him to the city.

B Later

Enter CORNELIA.

CORNELIA.

Thou bring'ft no comfort! Terror and dismay
Are written on thy brow ! Hafe, tell me, Flamen.

PRIEST.
Behold a soldiei bleeding from the field.

Enter GARTHA wounded.

CORNELIA.
Tris the Numidian chief!

GARTHA.

Lady, these wounds,

Which bleed to death, make GARTHA not aflam'd
That he alone revisits Aquileia.
Involuntary messenger am I
Of tidings harih to tell. My fiery iteed,
Gall'd with an arrow, bore me from the plain,
Where ffill your valiant sons maintain the fight,.
And with amfazing acions fate suspend.
The boldest soldiers of the tyrant's host
Shrink from their rage. Lady, I speak with pain.
This to the consul, I advis'd the sally,
And fell into the ambulh. I rejoice
That I ihall not survive it.

PRIEST.
Help! he faints.

GARTHA..

'Tis horrid silence all. The work of death
Is over; doubt and fear are at an end.
Now certain anguish and despair prevail.

Enter ^EMI LIUS attended.
My hubfand!

2EMILIUS.

Oh! CORNELIA! wretched dame!

Look not to me; I bring no consolation,
I cannot comfort thee. I could not save
My children from destruction. Rigid duty
Made me spectator of their overthrow.
O fatal ensigns of unhappy power!
O had .EM 1LI us been a poor Centurion,
He might unheeded have forsook his station,
And perilh'd with his children.

CORNELIA.

They are dead.

PAULUS and Tilus dead. Their motherlives!
Ye all dire&ting gods, whom we adore,
Whom I with spotless hands have ever serv'd,
Is misery like this my just reward ?
Your dearest gifts are to deftruaion tur'd.
Had I not been the fond, the.happy mother
Of sons, for whom all mothers envy'd me,
I had not been above all Women wretched.

PRIEST.

Great are thy woes, CORNELI A, great indeed!
Yet not unfrequent in this changeful world
Are woes like thine; and greater still than thine.
The famous matron of thy name and blood,
The fir CORNELI-A, saw her g(dlike sons.
In Rome betray'd, and fain by Roman hands.
And oft in every age have wretched mothers
Surviv'd their families', their country's ruin,
And liv'd fad captives in a foreign land:
No kindred ear to hear, no eye to weep
In pity of their woes: no human face
For them to look on, but the hateful face

Of

Of foes, who made them childless, widows, slaves,
To thee remain thyhulband, and thy country,
In whose defence thy sons so greatly died.
Thee Rome shall honour, and revere in thee
The sacred memory of her heroes slain.

EAMILUS.

It is the right, the birthright, of our house,
For Rome to die: in every signal Rrife,
In every fruggling period of the state,
My fires have bled. My sons have chose their time;
Bravely they fought, and aobly were they slain.
Rome still shall tand, tho' the IEm i L I fall.
The tyrant's works are levell'd with the ground,
And his proud tower yet finbkes upon the plain.
Our ramparts now his fierce assaults defy;
The Roman army, like a gather'd storm,
Rolls towards him. My sons thall be reveng'd;
My eyes miall fee, my sword ihall lhare, the vengeance.

CORNELIA.

IMean while, unburied on the bloody field,
Amidst the common heap, my children lie.
Majeffic PAULUS, and my lovely TITUS,
Is this the end of all your mother's care ?
Some fierce barbarian now insults the dead;
Adding dilhoneft wounds. O ! might not gold
Their dear remains redeem? Alas! alas!
'Tis the sole consolation I can hope for,
To save them from the beats and birds of prey,
That howl and scream around there fatal walls.
To fold once more their bodies in my arms n
To lav them decent. on the funeral pile,
And o'er their aihes pour a parent's heart.

AEMILIUS.

Mindful of that fad duty, I sent forth
A herald to the tyrant, and expect
Each moment his return. The trumpet founds.

[Enter Herald, witb an Officer of MAXIMiN'S.

'Tis he, and with him one whose lofty port,
And splendid arms, bespeak his high command.

CORNELIA.
Forgive, 0 chief unknown, a mother's grief,

Which,

Which, hort'ning the refpec thy presence claims,
Haftes to enquire, if MAXI M IN will.give
The bodies of her children to the .tomb ?

With breach of vows, 'and unproyok'd rebellion
But chiefly thee, who fir . withstood thy sovereign,
And ftopt the progrefsff his.jull revenge.

Before the fun Ihall set, give up the city.

CORNELIA. -

Relentless tyrant! 0 all-feeing gods!
How dire a profpea opens to CORNELIA ?

.iMILIUS.

I hand now not in equal lifts with MAXIMIN,
Nor mean I here to plead the cause of Rome:
'Twould but offend thine ear. Yet tell thy lord,
He knows .E'MILIUS not, and therefore wrongs him
By this unworthy trial of his faith; -
Unhappy, most unhappy, he may make me,
But he and fortune cannot make me baTe.

OFFICER.
Is this the answer I must bear to MAXIMIN ?

.EMILiUS.
What other answer could he hope from me?

OFFICER.
Think of the consequence of this defiance.

iEMILIUS.

I'll meet it when it comes: now I must think
Oftruft repos'd in me by injur'd Rome.

OFFICER.

Stout are thy words. But will this pride of spirit
Sustain thee through the horrors that surround thee ?
Thy lips have now pronounc'd thy children's doom,
Which executed, as it soon must be,
Will move the fterneft soldier of our camp
To tender pity. Never yet were seen
So brave a pair as thy unhappy sons;
Nature on them has pour'd out all her gifts
And dreft their virtue in the fairest form.

CORNELIA.

O thou, whose tongue in Roman accents speaks,
Whose gentle aspect Ihews a mind humane.!
Take pity on the most unhappy parents,
That ever bore the name. This fatal day
Has prov'd too well the worth of there my sons,
Whom nature, tho' they less deferv'd, would love,
O ! soften to the tyrant this refusal.-
I know not what to fay; I have no right,
But that which signal misery confers,

To

To beg from thee afliflance. If thou haft
At home an anxious mother, or fad spouse,
Who daily trembles for thy noble life,
Think of her ltate, and liften to CORNELIA,
Whose tongue till now did never plead for favour.

.-MILIUS.

Thy friendihip, tho' I sand the tyrant's foe.

AMMILIUS ! fortune rules the lives of men.
Had I been consul, and possess'd in Rome
Of civil dignity; perhaps, like thee,
1 hould have arm'd me in the senate's cause;
Whilst thou, a soldier on the distant frontier,
Perhaps, like me, hadst fought thy leader's quarrel.
The armies of the north acknowledge MAXI M I N.
I lead the Britifi legions to the war:
But more of this hereafter. Thou haftheard
My horrid message, and haft made such arifwer
As well becomes a Roman and a confil.

Bred to hard service in our Britifl wars,
Accuftom'd to explore the forests wild,
Alone, amidst the perils of the night,
And mingle fearless with the savage foes;
Difguis'd in their attire and uncouth arms,

Of thee, and of thy virtues; oft iejoic'd,,
That I could claim affinity with them;
But not the fantion of thy honout!d voice,
Not all the credence due to worth like thine,
Can move my stedfast mind. There isbut one,.
One only path which mortals safely tread,
The sacred path of rectitude and truth.
I follow, tho' it leads me to the tomb.
Forgive me, noble Roman ! o'er thy head;
Perhaps, this instant dire discovery hangs,
And thou and Rome are loft, and basely loft.
No, let the consul, as he ought, defy
The tyrant's threat'ning, and rely on heav'n.
For me, and PAULUs too, our hearts are six'd,,
Deliberation of our state is vain -
For if the consul fhouid this city yield,
Inevitable death abides his sons.
