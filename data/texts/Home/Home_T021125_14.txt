A
TRAGEDY.

ACT I. SCENE I.
A court and hall, common to the palaces of the kings

of SPARTA.

Enter SANDANE attfnd,d.
H ASTEN, ORONTES, to the senate house,

And leu if rumor's voice has spoke the truth.

[Exit t1hndan7t.

The adverse fortune of an exil'd king
Pursues my lord, Achaia's generous aid
Sustains his cause in v.in. Why risk a battle,
When the continuance.of defensive war
Secur'd success and viCtory in Sparta ?
Would I had never left thy splendid court,
Delightful Sardis ! to be Sparta's queen.

E,;tr AMPHARES.
Welcome, AMPHAIRS ! Have the armies met?

B AM-

AMPHARES.

They have. This morning, at the break of day,
The Spartan.ary charged Achaia's hof.
This and no more is known. Suspense and fear
Possess the people; to the gates they run,
Then to their houfs: the fill whisper spreads
Thro' justing multitudes the drad alarm.

SANDANE.

Alas ! revenge and empire now depend
On the wild issue of unruly war.
What if the arms of AGIs should prevail .

AMPHARES.

Although he should, the toils of fate farround him.
Dauntless and firm our brave afrociates fland,
And with impatience wait the deftin'd hour
Torulh on Ais. This unlook'd-for battle
Is but a solemn prelude to the at,
Which bold conspiracy will soon perform.
This day shall terminate the reign of AGIS,
And make, 0 Queen! all power in Sparta thine.

SANDANE.

I fee that danger only whets the brave.
But yet, AMPHARES, if my lord is vanquifh'd,
Will not the conquering army awe the city ?

AMPHARES.

AGIs shall be the surety of our cause,+
And hostage for our safety, till we wrest
The sword from proud LYSANDER, if he conquers;
But that I fear not much. New to command
From idle Athens the mock hero comes,
Starts up a soldier, and a flatefman too;
Each palm he claims: All hononrs must adorn
The chosen friend of visionary AGIs.

SANDANE.

May Mars dire& him so to guide the war,
As AGIS rules the slate: And mutiny

Prove

Prove there as fatal as sedition here.

AMPHARES.

This factious state must change its feeble form,
Waver no more beneath a double reign
Of limited, contending, useless kings.
Henceforth our monarch shall in Sparta rule,
As Jove alone in high Olympus reigns.

SANDANE.

So reign the mighty monarchs of the Eaf ;
And such imperial power, I thought, belong'd
To Sparta's king, else I had ne'er been queen.
Young, and decelv'd, I left my father's court
For Lacedamon's miserable sceptre.
I did endeavour to extend its sway,
And to ambition rous'd my Spartan lord.
But the vain pupil of the Grecian schools,
Unprincely AGIs, marr'd the brave design.
Chief of the multitude, idol and slave
Of the base populace, he led the herd,
He urged their brutal fury on the king.

AMPHARES.

And now their fury on himself recoils.
Like the unruly elephant, they turn,
And trample down the ranks in which they fought.

SANDANE.
That is their Liberty.

AMPHARES.
Let us employ,

And then suppress, such formidable licence.
My magistracy now is near expir'd;
A king's resentment and a rival's hate
Have long hung over my devoted head:
Farewel to place, to dignity, and power,
Whilst haughty Acrs fills the Spartan throne.
I will not live obscure in Lacedaemon, i
Nor roam thro' Grecian states a banifh'd man.

B 2 If

If I mull set, to rife and {hine no more,
A fiery track shall mark my setting fun.
But AGIs comes.

SANDdAE.

And AGESISTRATA.

Farewel! Success attend thee, brave AMPIHARES !
I will not stay. My foul disdains to hide
Its hatred or its scorn. [Exit SANDANF.

AMPHARES.
Yet they who mean

To gratify these pafions, muit conceal them.
This day decides my fate. So let it be,
Such brief conclusion have I ever lov'd.
Affitl me, Hermes, God of firatagem,
With artful words, to sooth the mind of AGIS,
And turn him from the track my purpose holds.

Enter Acls and AGESISTRATA.

AGESISTRATA.
Alas, my son! that bold bad man I dread I

AGIS.

He feemsto waitus. Atthishour, AMPHARES,
I think that thou of all men fhou'dft have shunn'd me.

AMPHARES.

My motive in attending here your pretence
Merits a leG injurious salutation.

AGIS.

I know thy merits, and I will reward them.
Art thou not author of the woes of Sparta,
Prime mover and infiamer of sedition ?
Bast thou not bent the power of thy high office
To the subversion of the slate thou ferv'l ?
At thee this day my indignation burns.
4 am diUonoun'd -

Au'

AMPHARES.

What has dilhono~ 'd thee ?
AGIS.

Thou and thy praAices, they have compell'd me
To leave the noblest fiation of a prince.
In time of war where should a king be found
But at his army's head ? There AGIS stood,
When you and your p:efumptuous Ephori
l'equired my presence here. UngratefulSpartang.
Had you allow'd me but one other day,.
Then had I fought this battle for my country,
And died or conquer'd with her bravelt sons.

AGESISTRATA.

Peril, my son ! dwells not in camps alone:
In cities, palaces, and courts of justice,.
With treachery and treason Ihe inhabits.
Peril attended thus thou mull encounter,
More hideous sure than in the ranks of war.

AMPHARES.

I know my ations have incens'd the king.
But I imagin'd not that such suspicions
found entertainment in your royal breafs ?

AGi&.

Hafl thou not join'd the enemies of Apis ?
Thou Who wall once his friend, inconltant man

' AMPHARES.

I have oppos'd the counsel of a foe,
Whose arts depriv'd me of my prince's favour.

AGIs.

Thou haft oppos'd LTCURGUs and the laws,
Which rais'd the name of Sparta to the kkies.
The Delphic God infpir'd the deep design:
For more than human was that power of thought
Which joia'd the public to the private good,
With such perfe&ion, that each felfilh pallion
Flow'O in the 1chael of the common welfare,

B3 A---A

And, like one family of sons and fires,
And dearest brothers, a great people liv'd.
In peace they liv'd without or strife or scorn,
In war they fought to conquer, or to die.
Equal and free, our happy fathers knew
No interest but the interest of the slate;
No gain but Sparta's glory; proud they bore
That palm aloft, and (har'd the high refpe&t,
The admiration, which £ontenting Greece
Paid to th' imperial virtue of their country.

AMPHARPS.

Revolving time that system overthrew,
And chang'd the manners and the laws of Sparta.

AGIs.

The laws have been negleced, not annull'd,
And corrupt rulers have corrupted manners.
Authority will soon revive the laws,
And great example yet restore the manners,
In fpiteof those who haveopprefs'd their country,
Depriv'd the people of their antient rights,
And while the nation funk beneath their sway,
Still flrove for power in a declining kingdom,
Still fought for wealth in an impoverifh'd land.
Even at this hour rapacious they persist,
And, like fowne wretches in a stranded velel,
Plunder and riot in the midst of ruin.

AMPHARES.

Mov'd by the present perils of the state,
This signal hour I chose, unknown as yet
The fortune of the field, to change my condut,
And make an offer of my aid to AGIs.

AGIS.

If I should judge the future by the past,
Thou must forgive me, tho' I doubt thy faith.

AGE-

AG ESISTRATA.

Yet hear him, AGIS: in an hour like this
He who affitance offers is a friend.

AGIS.

This hour may yet deceive their country's foes.
I know the base foundation of that hope
Which makes my baffled enemies presume.
LYSANDER's army in its ranks contains
The belt and bravest of Laconia's sons;
The faction with and hope defeat to them,
That Sparta's generous youth may ne'er return
To guard that freedom which has made them brave.

AMPHARE3.

The boldness of their hopes their deeds will prove
In the assembly, if Achaia conquer.

AGESISTRATA.
AMPHARES, fay, what is their utmost aim ?

AMPHARES.

The old dependantsof the exil'd king,
And all the venal members of the ,late,
Won by S ANDANE'S arts and foreign gold,
Aim to restore LEONIDAS, who comes
With holtile armies to enslave his country:
Therefore SANDANE'S proffers I rejected,
Have warn'd the king, and would have serv'd him too;
But since resentment and difiruft prevent me,
Neutral I itand, and will not seek that welcome
Which his more artful enemies would give.

Ac;s.

Thou fpeak'ft more boldly than becomes AMPHARES.
Add that to the offences I forgive.
It is the sacred maxim of my reign,
That in a prince's comiecrated breast
Revenge and anger Ihould not long remain.
These passions in a king affliC the tate,
By driving ralh offenders to despair.

B 4 This

This day decides your charater with me.
Now let your actions prove your words sincere.

AMPHARES.

No other terms I alk, and sure I am
Ne'er Ihall AMPHARES need again forgiveness.

[Exit A frrirARES.
Manent Acrs and AGESISTRATA.

AGIS.

Well has he judg'd the season of fubmiflion.
He will assist us if LYSANDER conquers,

AGESISTRATA.

May Jove avert the evils which I fear!
I dread the ruin of the Spartan state,
And fear the downfal of our antient house;
The blackelt fury of the Stygian realm,
The most deftru&ive, is infernal Discord.
Bath'd in the blood of kings (he walks this world,
And tumbles lates and empires to the ground.

AGIS.

Nations oft perish by their princes crime
But now if Sparta's antient slate mull fall,
Gods and good men (hall witness for its king,
That he with fate contended for his people,
And on the ruins of their virtue fell.

AGESISTRATA.

Think not I mean to blame your high design,
Age has not chang'd the tenor of my mind,
Nor pall'd my admiration of true glory.
Sprang, like thy father, from Alcides' blood,
I feel the spirit of the Spartan line.
Only let me adjure thee to beware,
And walk with caution thro' surrounding perils.
Tho' thou defpifeft every form of danger,
Think what a helpless train attends on thee,
An aged mother, and al infant foa.

AG1S.

AGIS.
Divine Alcides will protec his race.

AGESISTRATA.

I will invoke the God; in times like these
Prayers are the arms of our defenceless seX.
A spotless choir of matrons and of virgins,
Who o'er their country mourn, myself will lead
To the high temple of the son of Jove.
He yet may hear the voice of supplication,
And ir-etch his arm to save the Spartan Itate.

[Exit AGESISTRATI.

AcGI al:e.

Without, the enemt'; within, the facion.
What (hou'd I think ? I have a thousand thoughts
That rife and fall like waves upon the flore.
I need thee now, LYSANDER ! O my friend
I lean on thee, and thou perhaps art faU'n.
Ye ever-living gods, who know my heart,
I trust in you, for righteous are my thoughts,
All bent on raising up long-protfrate Sparta.
With Sparta too, I would be proud to rife,
And gain such glory as my fathers gain'd,
When Persia's tyrant trembled at their arms.
If in this just ambition I should perish,
My name fiall go to nations yet unborn.
But I muff change my Itrain; Eu ANTHS come.
Alas, LYSANDER, led by love and thee,
She ltft her Athens for this land of broils.

Enter EUASTHE.

EUANTHE,
N'o tidings from the camp .

Acis.

None, fair Eu ANTJIE,
If we had lol the field, the flying rout

Ere

Ere this had reach'd our gates.

EUANTHE.

Oh! many a damec

Matron and virgin, tremble at this hour;
But who has cause like mine ? The most forlorn
And desolate of women is EUANTHE !
If _

AGIS.

Small the chance of what EUANTHE fears:

In the long wars of ftill-contending Greece
Leaders of armies have but rarely fallen.

EUANTHE.

One thing I know, and with prophetic tongue
I speak it, Prince ! if Sparta triumph not,
Ne'er Mlall your eyes again behold LYSANDER.
Disdain in him is fatal as despair.

AGIS.

When he returns vicorious from the field,
Then ihall he hear who best has spoke his praifc.
But I must leave you now: The senate waits me.
Hereafter we shall speak of this, and smile
Like mariners who on the peaceful (hore
Sit, and with pleasure talk of tempcfts pafl.

[Exit Acls.

EUANTHE alone.

This fledfaft cafe is all affum'd, I fee;
He flaggers at the imminent event.
How dreadful is this interval to me,
Who am terest and destitute of all
Those aids that flay afflition; and must bear
The weight of woe that's heavier every hour.
The queen, and generous AGIS too, discharge
The dues of kindred with unfeigned love.
But our acquaintance is not old enough
To yield a ripen'd sympathy, whose taste
Alone can comfort such a mind as mine.
Yet I repent me not in this extreme,

That

That I forsook my country and my friends.
They would have forc'd me to a loathed bed,
And torn me from the noblest of mankind.
If he should fall! my love ! my only love !
Shall I survive thee; and return to Athens,
Be humbled there before my haughty kindred,
And hear them blame the alhes of LYSANDER ?
Forbid it, fearless love ! forbid it, Ihame !
Forbid it, honour, and my nature's pride;
Death fall forbid it, for I dare to die.

Enter RHESUS.

EUANTHE.
RHESUS, Great Gods! Oh fay, how fares LYSANDER !

RHESUS.
As well as glorious victory can make him.

EUANTHE.

Forgive my rash despair, my thanks accept,
Ye gracious powers who guard his daring breast.
Where is he now ?

RHESUS.

With AGIS in the fcnate.

EUANTHE.
Already here; blest be the Gods of Greece!

RHESUS.

Soon as the trumpet from pursuit recall'd
Our conquering Spartans, in the field arriv'd
A weary meflenger, by Aols sent;
LYSANDER firait bespoke the royal band:
' With all the speed of men to Sparta hafle,
" Chastise bold treason, and defend your king,"
He said; and call'd to me. With a few horse
I follow'd him: And when he fought the king,
By his command to you I brought these tidings.

EUANTHE.
Moll welcome RHESUS. But has Sparta loft

None

None of her noble youth ?

RHESUS.

No man of note'

tell in the field but one, whose loss you'll mourn;
LYSANDER'S friend, Athenian POLYDORUS.

EOANTHE.

Alas! alas ! my joy is riL'd' with woe.
Unhappy youth ! on my ill-omen'd head
The blame of thy untimely death will fall.
Conduting me, thou cam'fl to distant Sparta.
Fatal the honours Sparta's king beltow'd
Upon the generous guardian of EUANTHE.

RwESUS.

Lady, the people of my native land,
The warlike Thracians, hold it vain to mourn
For men who fall in battle; fach they deem
The favourites of MARS, our country's God.
Those they bewail who die by dire disease,
Of youth and vigor full. But most of all
Lament old men, who drink the bitter dregs
Of life and woe, and in decrepit age
(Extremity of dotagel wish to live.

EUANTHE.

Who are those men who near the temple fland ?
Uncouth to me their garb, and firange their arms.

RHESUS.
They are Thracians, lady.
EUANTHE.
What seek they here ?

RHESUS.
I will accolt the herald,
And learn his bufiaefs.

EUANTHE.
To the palace, RHESUS,

I go

I go the willing messenger of joy.
This vt&ory will free the anxious Queen
From many fears. I pray thee do not tarry,
But come and tell me what yon herald bears,
And what affairs still occupy the senate.

RHESUS.
Depend on the unwearied zeal of RHESUS.

[Exit RHESUS.

Manrt EUANTHE.

AGIS and Sparta, and the public cares,
Detain LYSANDER from my longing eyes.
I fee the happy change of my condition,
And (hare the triumphs of the man I love.
But yet the flightelt circuilltance creates
New fears to me. Why lingers thus LYSANDER !
My mind is not at reft; the winds are hush'd,
But Rill my bosom quivers from the florm.

Loud acclamations and the voice of joy

LYSANDER.
0 my life! my love !

To meet thee here is happiness compleat.
The Gods have blelt me to my utmost wi(h,
And brought me full of glory to EUANTHE.

EUANTHE.

Thanks to the Gods who have preferv'd LYSANDER.
Athenian Pallas sure has heard my prayers.

LYSANDER.

And mine ; for mutual is the lover's prayer.
Another deity I now invoke,
Whose rites the god of war has long delay'd,
With peace well-pleas'd {hall golden Hymen corme

Thy friend and mine, the generous POLYDORUS.

LYSANDER.

Tho' love and glory both my brealt inspire,
And fortune smiles on both, yet sorrow finds
A place to fit in: but 'tis temper'd sorrow;
For never Grecian hero greater died.

EUANTHE.

He fell the victim of his lo.e to thee;
He follow'd thee when thou forfook'ft EUANTHg,
Left me the day I touch'd the Spartan shore,
Tho' royal AGis begg'd thee to remain.

LYSANDER.

Unjust EUANTHE, thus to blame LYSANDER
Who fought the field, the soldier of his love
As of his sacred country: fought to gain,
With liberty, a rank and place of honour,
Such as becomes the husband of EUANTHE;
That tender name, and names that wait upon it,
A/ake emotions as implacable
To tyranny, as generous and great,
As-ever felf-renouncing hero own'd.
When the chief aim is right, all pafions elfc
Of .noble kind impell the self-same way.
The lover and the husband rouse and fire
The Spartan and the man.
Of common clay, and in one common mould
Mankind are made; but the celestial fire
That gives them life and foul, is liberty.
And I, Prometheus like, to gain that fire
For Sparta's foas, would brave the bolt of Jove.

EUANTHE.

To me you need not vaunt your daring mind.
Alas! LYSANDERI ! I am fill afraid
Of perils lurking in this troubled slate.
O leave me not again to grief and fear,

EUANTHE.

Yes, in thy absence he did talk of love,
Boastcd his wealth, his clients, and his power;
Mention'd the ruin of thy father's fortunes,
And spoke contemptuous of thy rash designs.

Enough?

Helot, return, and tell the noble dame
That the remembrance of her generous mind
Shall live for ever in my grateful breast.

EUANTIIE.
Who is this faithful friend ?

LYSANDER.

A Spartan dame,

A gentle one, tho' wedded to a foe
Of royal AGIS. In her virgin fiate
She was the conltant and the lov'd companion
Of fair D2IDAMIA, AGIS' Lhort-liv'd queen.
Thro' all our various firife, the generous dame
Preserves the friendlhips of her early days.
This scroll the king must fee. Farewel, EUA'THiE.

EUANTHE.
Its threatning firain awakes my former fears.

7 tE.Would

Would you had been, like me, content with love,
And never left Illyllus' flowery banks !
A fairer garland there you might have won,
Than ever war beftow'd, th' immortal wreath
Of PALLAS, queen of arts as well as arms.
But you forsook the vale, and left the Ihade
To climb ambition's bare and rocky height,
To stand the storms and tempests of the world.

LYSANDER.

Your words, like melancholy music, take
My lift'ning ear, and cause delusive sadness;
For vain the malice of our baffled foes,
And impotent will prove their last endeavours;
Palt are the storms and tempests of our fortune;
Let not EUANTHE heed the rack of clouds,
Nor dread the murmurs of the falling main.

EUANTHE.

Elate with vi&tory you scorn your foes.
I wish that RHESUS would return'again
Before you go to AGI. *-

LtSANDER.

Where is RHEsus ?
EUtANTHE.

I saw some warriors clad in horrid arms
Near yonder temple sand. StraitttEsus knew
The garb and arms of his own native Thrace,
And, wond'ring at the fight, went forth to learn
Who and from whence they were.

LYSANDER.

That should be known.

In yonder temple fit the Ephori,
Those fa&ious magistrates who love not AGIS.
If RH£tss come to you, detain him not;
Our resolutions may on him depend.

EUANTHE.
LYANDER, flay; you go again to Acs,

C Per-

Perhaps to plan new perils to thy life;
If so, by all that's fared I coajure thee
To let me know your purpose. Speak with me
Before you execute what you refolvc.
The image of the fiern AMPHAaES haunts me;
Need I entreat thee to defend me from him.

LYSABtEB1R.

No! by the Gods! O urge me not, EUANTHE !
Nor rouse those thoughts a lover cannot bear.
Defend thee from AMPHAXES I O my fair !

With what a double tongue the traitor spoke!
AU-feeing Gods! how little cdr we know
The greatness of those bleflings yoi confer.
Had we not fought to day, had we not conquer'd,
AGIS and Sparta had been lo ofor ever.

AGIs.

This vi&tory came like the boft of Jov,
And levell'd their designs.

Who from the blood of great Alcides fprirgs;
And yet fomc impious hand may ,rike the prince,
Altho' of virtue as of race divine.

Mount youTr Thefalian Iteed,,

And meet the troops that haften to your aid.
With eager steps the royal band advance,
Aud with for nothing but their king to lead them.
Then if the furies in their wrath provoke
Your foes to rife in arms, let arms 'decide.

Ne'er

Ne'er were the good and bad winnow'd fd well,
And fever'd from each other. Such the hols,
And such will be their fate, as when the rage
Of earth-born giants dar'd the sons of heaven.

AGIS.

Thou reafon'ft like an anxious friend, LYSANDER:
Thy fears are all for me, mine for my people.

Enter RHESUS.

Hail, gallant RHESUS ! know'ft thou ought of those
Thy countrymen, who thus unlook'd-for come,
And in a doubtful hour perplex our councils.

RHESUS.

The Thracians are a thousand men compleat.
From snowy Hemus and the northern hills
Of wild Odryfus the fierce warriors come.
RHINALCES leads them, of illustrious birth;
But, stern, imperious, and grown old in arms,
He knows no umpire but the sword, no law
Except obedience to the prince he serves.

AGIs.

Such oft are thole that quit a needy home
To serve as hirelings in a tyrant's host.

RHESUS.

Next in command, my brother Euxus stands,
A Youth to MARS devoted; for he loves
Danger itself, not danger's rich reward.

LYSANDER.
Haft thou yet seen him ?

RHESUS.
No.
LYSANDER.

Has he yet heard
That thou art here in Sparta ?

RHESUS.

He believes
C 3 That

I kept my name and quality conclca'd
For fifpef tetha ta hefi Thraacia tops .
Though hir'd for gia, wsre for Sprta mant.
If it prove so, I miy'be ufful here:
My valiant brother bears a generous mind,
And, tho' of arms enmour'd, jie loves.

AcGs.

Haste to your valiant brother, and explain,
With an impartial tongue, the state of Sparta.
Shew him where justice, and where honour ftaqd.
If these are ficred, as thou fay'yt they are,
To gallant Euxus he may prove a friend.

LYSANDERt.

Exert the arong cruIf of a broih.;
And tell him, g!,vus if he kiyes b.gt a*as,
And that immoti gloq, valour gains,
No more to wI4 a mqrc, ry fwor4,
But plant himself wth thee i Spart's fi'l,
Where Ac s will his noble ntlr'e cherish,
And rear his cou/rage.to such lofty deeds,
As antient story tells of Sparta's chiefs. [EElt RHESW.

AGia.

I hope that RgauES will divide the Thracians:
This favours well the biass of my mind,
Averse to leave the city oq fufpi on,
And drive the wavering fa&tion to. xtremes.

LYSANDER.

0 generous prince ! whom I admire and blame.
The greatest foe, the foe LYSANDER dreads
Is the unequall'd gentlenes of'AGls.
Review the tlory of the Grecian lates,
And mark how freedom fell in every land

Th;e

The brave affertrs of the public cause
Have ever been too mild In evil times;
Have, like indulgent parents, spar'd the rod,
And let the vices of their children live
To kill the virtues. Hence, let Acis learn
The only lefoln that is nature needs.

AGISM

Uncertain is the peril if I flay,
But certain is the evil if I fly.
I will remain; but to afrure y safety,
You mull, LYSANDER, to the troops return.

LTSANDIiR.

And leave my prince alone amidst his foes !
Revoke the hard command. If you're refolv'd
To brave the peril, then my plate I claim
Next to your person; by your fide I fiansd
Perhaps some noble service IEay render,
Receive the mortal wound aim'dat ly prince,
And with my life redeem the life of AGIs.

AGIS.

Your great imagination's up in arms;
But hear me, and let calmer reason judge.
I am determin'd not to quit the city,
The guilt of civil war Ihall not be mine.
LYSANDER'S presence here without the troops
Would but embolden and excite my foes,
Who may be tempted by this fair occasion,
This mighty vantage, to furprize us both.
Without delay, once more, LYSANDER, arm,
And ofientatiopfly pass thro' the gate.
This vitory, and the approaching host,
Will hush the threatned form.

LY AND R.

So may it prove.
C 4 But

But there is something in my heart rebels
Againfl this counsel! Oh I I cannt leave you--
Nor ought I now to flay. Let never man
Say in the morning that the day's his own:
Things past belong to memory along;
Things future are the property of hope.
The narrow line, the iflhmus.of these seas,
The inflant scarce divisible, is all
That mortals have to fland on. 0 my prince!
LYSANDER leaves you with a heavy heart.

AGrn.

Farewel, thou Spartan of the antient mould,
Dear as the brother of his blood to AGIs !

[Thry ,mbrare and part.
LYSANDER!

LYSANDER.
Ha! may heaven your purpose change!

AGIS.

My will is fx'd. But though myjudgment too
Confirms the secret counsel of my heart,
7tt I may be deceiv'd; perhaps, my friend,
We part this moment ne'er to meet again.

LYSANDER.

Let us not part at all. 'Tis inspiration,
The guardian God, the Demon of the mind,
Thus often presses on the human breast.

AGIS.

Mistake me not, I feel no new impreflion,
Nor if I did, (hould I by that be alter'd;
For such presages, be they fad or joyful,
I deem them but the meteors of the mind,
Bred by the inward elemental firife,
When great events perplex and lhake the foul.
My thoughts regard the slate. If I should fall,
To thee, LYSANDER, I commit my son,
The only pledge of my DEIDAMIA'S love.

Train

Train up the boy to walk in the fame path
Which we have trod together, the freight path
Of virtue and true glory. If he'proves
Of noble nature, and I hopeno less,.
He will not Ihun the lofty path of honour,
Tho' fate Ihould maark it with his father's blood;

LYSANDER.

Hear this, immortal Gods! who rule the world,
And guard a prince the image of yourselves!
O never, never may his royal i ace
LYSANDER'S aid require. [Exit LYSANDER.

ACIS alone.

Affeftion choaks his words,

His generous heart burfis at this fulemn parting.
In times like there of a declining slate,
Baseness infects the general race of men;
But yet there trying times rear up a few
More excellent, refin'd, and confciousfpirits,
More principled, and fit for all events,
Than any in the good, but equal, mass
Of a far better age. Such is LYSANDER.
The hour draws near.

Will guide thy steps; by my command he waits
Without the palace.

But I'll repair my fault,

What dolt thdu mean ?
LYSANDER.

AG I commanded me to leave the city,
And thinks, would-tothelGods he.thought aright!
That his LY SANDER heads the Spartan troops,
In whom his only hope of safety lies.
But I, EUANTHE ! partial to thy will,
Sought thee in vain. In that unhappy time
They seiz'd the gates, and Ihut me up in Sparta.
Fate punilhes with too severe a doom
The human wenefs of indulgent loVe.
AGcs ! I come!--Fof the deep voices now
Of duty, friendmip, gratitude, and glory,
Sound thro' my breast; 'and from my beating heart
Their echo rings. Farewel! my love, farewel!

EUANTHE.

Not yet, LYSANDER ! AGIS is oppref,.
And Sparta too. Does duty, or does hoiour,
Require LYSANDER, like an eastern slave,
To fall attendant on the royal pile ?
What can you do ? The army will betray you:
So with the few, the faithful few that love you,
You'll do some desperate a&ion, and be slain.
If you despise your life, yet think of me,
The prey of curfi AMPHARIS.

LYSANDER.

Infernal God !
Let me not think of that. Retire, EUANTHE,

This night I'll force ill.guarded Sparta's gates,
And save my prince, my country, and EUANTHE.

Thy princes thy country are already loft.

The Ihip that bore me to tne Spartan {hore
Rides nill at anchor: leave this wretched land,
Where'er thou goeft I will attend thy steps ;
Thy gods (hall be my gods; thy people, mine,

LYSANDER.

Alas! EUANTHE does not fee the (hame,
The ruin of that counsel love inspires.
Th' eternal gods repose this hour in me
No common trust: Upon my deeds depend

My soldiers too, my brave, my faithful soldier?,

Freely devotes his life to godlike Acis.
And (hall their leader, mall the friend of Ac is,
Forsake his prince ? I will forget thy words;
Repeat them not.

Is this LYSANDER'S love

Mnft I not speak ? Is my reward reproach ?
For you I left my friends and native land,
Defy'd all danger, and all censure fcorn'd;
Now in my fore distress I call on thee
For whom I susser, to protect my honour,
And in my fore distress dost thou upbraid me ?

Reflore thee to thy colntry and thy friends,
Of whom thou dost complain I have bereft thee.
LYSANDER will acquit himself to thee,
And to mankin4--

EUANTHE.

Delude me not. Alas!

Thy tongue speaks comfort; but thy voice, thy looks,
Wild and unsettled, drive me to despair:
For thou, methinks, art defptrate, LYSANDER.
Those lips that quiver, and those eyes that roll
Like dragon's eyes, those are not signs of love !
Thou fay'ft that thou wilt bear mre back to Athens;
Will that acquit thee, if thou leav'ft me there .
Is that thy purpose ?

LYSANDER.
Yes. I'll leave the world,

And death shall wipe dishonour from my name;
AGIS and Sparta flall forgive me then,
And every debt be paid.

EUANTHE.

LYSANDEA, no.

Love's victims are not of your sterner sex.
It is the destiny of womankind
Constant to live, and desolate to die.
To itrong neceflity EUANTHE yields.
If I should tear you from the fide of AoGs,
I fee my fate; you ne'er would love me more
Tho' you should live, yet you would die to me.
But I will rather flay and perish here
Than live without thee. Go, and fight for Aois;
But in the hour of danger think of me !

And thro' each period of my ripeiing years

And flriek'd for help, this arm, this tingle arm,
Had baffled all the craft of false AMPHARES.

This pride becomes thee, and thy loft conditibn.

LYSANDER.

In this condition it becomes me belt
To brave AMPHARES. Had he been a captive
1 Ihould have pitied him.

AMPHARES,
Plead'lt thou for pity ?

LYSANDER.

For none that thou can'st give. Hear me, then judge,
If what I speak is meant to win thy favour.
I Should have pitied thee by fate subdued:
Oppreft with crimes, thy spirit would have ihrunk
Under calamity, and guilt have marr'd
The noble vigor and the port of manhood.
Amidst thy triumph, does it not confound thee,
To think thou ow'It it to excels of baseness ?
Thou hist prevail'd, becaule the generous AGIS
Would not believe there could be such a traitor.

AMPHARES.

Oft have I heard, and often seen thy folly,
But now to rail is madness. With one word
I could impose qn thee eternal silence.

And his vi&orious troops at break of day
Will thunder in thine ears: thou and thy band
Will ill fulfain the shock of such an host.

Thy fate depends on mine. In Lacedzmon

From thee, and to contention turn'd my heart.

EUANTHE.
Yet look on me before we part for ever.

LYSANDER.

At looks or words of tenderness, he'll smile,
And o'er the sorrows of our love rejoice:
Forgive me still, I muff not, cannot speak.

EUANTHE.

But I will speak, and earth and heaven hall hear mle.
AMPHA ES too shall hear; for it will gaul him,
To hear EUANTHF. now avow her love
And faith to her LYSANDER. Powerful words,
Emblerps and figures of firm constancy,
Such as fond lovers lavishly employ
To tooth the pangs of parting and of absence.
Such nufiic vows accord not with our state,
Our dreadful fate: yet do not grieve thy heart,
Thy noble heart, too full of other sorrows,
With thoughts of what may happen to EUANTHE.

Nothing

Nothing (hall happen to debase ETOANTHE.
The bondage and the Ihame that women susser,
Who live the slave of those who flew their lords,
I ne'er Thall know, I never will endure.
If cruel destiny decrees thy fall,
Unspotted to the 1hades I'll follow thee,
For whom alone on earth I'd wi(h to live.

LTSANDER,
Lead on. Farewel, EUANTHE.

EUANTHE.

Gods above !

AMPHARES.

Conduct her to the tower where late you lodg'd
The captive queen.

EUANTHE.

Alas! no guarded tower,

Or vaulted dungeon, ever yet contain'd
Two more unhappy, or more helpless captives!

[ Exeunt guarded.

AMPHAR ES.

LYSANDER's fierce demeanour and his threats,
Proud as he is, spring not from pride alone;
I must stretch forth my arms to fhelter'd AGIS.
If I accomplish not this night his ruin,
Tomorrow's rising fun may fee my fall.
Curst be the temples ! curst the priests of Sparta !
Now I am like a man who has adventur'd
To cross the flats forsaken by the main,
And looking b.ick fees not the shore he left;
Thro' deeps and shallows, rocks, and quaking sands
On he must go. To stop is sure perdition.

Enter SANDANE.
Hail to the queen of Sparta !

SAN.

SANDANB.

Yes, AMPHARES!

Now fortune seems to fnile upon SANDAN N.
I saw the fullen captive led along,
His gloomy eye-balls six'd upon the earth.

AMPHARES.

This night, 0 queen ! must fee the bold conclusion
Of a deign, thus far so bravely borne.
On hollow and deceitful ground we tread,
Whilst AGIS lives.

SANDANE.

Thou fpeakft my very thoughts.

$eafons there are, AMPHARES, which suspend
All fan&imonious reverence and refpe&.

AMPHARES.

Temples, and priests, and altars (hall not save him,
If fate should drive us to the last extreme.
Meanwhile, I will employ more gentle means
To gain our ends; For sacrilege would rouse
The zealous multitude to rage and arms.
The temple is begirt with Thracian bands,
Who all access forbid; and AGIS knows not
What has befallen LYSANDEB. I willfend
A subtle Spartan in LYSANDER'S name,
Who may by specious arguments persuade him
To quit the fancuary; ai'd then, 0 queen !
With all solemnity of pomp and form,
Th' assembled Ephori (hall pass his doom,
And in the fame decree include ¥YSANDER.

SANDANE.

Think'ft thou the Ephori will give the f&anion
Of their authority to AGIsW death ?

AMPHARES.
They will. At midnight the stern judges meet

In

Ia Terror's temple; they have charg'd a herald
With orders to the troops not to advance
On pain of treason. The aftonifh'd people
Will crouch and tremble at that awful power,
Which draws the sword of justice on a king.
Then Ihall your lord's authority revive;
And like the fun, when bursting from a cloud,
With greater power and brighter splendor ihine.

LJSANDER as a Prfner, the Thracian Guards at a

LYSANDER musing, advances andfpeaks.
HA S virtue no prerogative on earth ?

And can the Gods permit the fall of AGIS ?

They can. 'Tis man's own arrogance arrays him
In gorgeous titles of excelling nature,
Care of the Gods, and centre of creation.
I fear, I fear man's life is but a dream;
His foul a subtile essence of the blood,
A rainbow beauty, made to shine a space,
Then melt and vanish into air.
Ye mighty minds of fages and of heroes!
Epaminondas, Plato, great Lycurgus !
Who once with such transcendent glory shone,
Brighter than all the liars th at deck the heavens,
Is your celestial fire for ever quench'd,
And nought but alhes left, the sport of chance,
Which veering winds fiill blow about the world?
I will not think so! Yet, alas ! the while
I fee and feel presages that alarm.
If they prove true. If man is like the leaf,
Which falling from the tree revives no more,
I Ihall be shortly dust. That will not hear
EUANTHE weep, nor fee the /hame of Sparta!

Now I'm a living man, my mind is free,
And, whilst I live and breathe, by heaven I'll at
As if I were immortal.

RHESUS.

See where he stands ! behold him !- my brother I
The bravest and the best of human kind.-
Opprelt with grief and shame, and fatal love,
Indignant virtue but augments his pain.
Will not my Euxus give his aid to heave
This noble velTel from the rock it beats on ?

[Gets up to LYSANDE1.
My lord ! my leader! Oh!

LYSANDER.

My faithful RHESUS!

Com'lf thou to (hare the ruin that LYSANDBR
Has brought upon himself, his prince, his country ?

RHESUS.

I come more eager and more proud to (are
Thy present fortune, than thy former glory.
Alas, my lord ! 'twou'd make a stranger weep,
To fee the chief, whom conquest crown'd to day,
A captive.

LYSANDER.

RHFSUS, thou haft nam'd the least

Of my calamities. I could endure,
With Spartan fortitude, my own disasters;
Bear to be hurled from meridian glory,
And, like a falling. far, be seen no more.
But oh ! the king !-and desolate EUANTHE --

RHESUS.
Do not despair.

LYSANDER.
Thou art my only hope.
This day thy generous brother fav'd my life;

At

Is .;i the hands of Euxus-

RHESUS.

Ah! my brother!

tutus.

0 chief of Sparta t Euxu3 is diftreft
On every fide. Thy virtue, thy misfortunes
Have touch'd my heart: but here in trult I fland.
Would I had never seen the walls of Sparta!

LYSANDER.

The Gods, the guardian Gods of Lacedatmon,
have brought you hither to preserve a people,
And save from traitors' hands the belt of kings;
Altho' at first you rafbly drew the sword
In blind obedience to a leader's will,
The gallant Euxus will not sure perfill
In error known, in manifest injustice.
Thy trade is war, brave soldier; this is not
An office for thy sword.

Euxus.

True are thy words.

1 was indeed deceiv'd, and came not here
To mix in Sparta's firife; but honour now-

RHESUS.

t will not hear thee plead so bad a cause.
Is there a bond in nature like the tie
Which binds the hearts of brothers? And will Euxuis
From vain ideas of fidelity
To that detefled traitor, false AMPHARES,
}hib brother murder ?

vuxus$

Euxus.
No.

RHESUS.
Then let thy arms

Defend LYSANDER. By our country's Gods
I swear, and by out warlike father's foul,
Whose well-beloved son thou ever wert,
That with the Spartan chief thy brother dies,

LYSANDER.

Might you not favour the escape of AGIs
The guards are Thracians.

Euxus.
I might favour thine.
My power extends not to the guards of AG s.

RHESUS.
And wilt thou not ?

Euxus.
Command thyself, my brother,

RHESUS,
How carft thou hesitate ?

Euxus.
I mull beware,

Inferior in command to bold RHINALCES,
And ever view'd by him with jealous eyes.
Whilst I deliberate no time is loft.
The light of day suits not with your defignsu
Before the night comes on, I will determine.

LYSANDER.

' is almost night, the fun hath left the heavensi
And doubtful twilight ushers in the gloom.
Perhaps the enemies of AcGI wait
The darkness of the night to cover deeds
They dare not aa by day. This night I dread-

RHESUS.

RHESUS.

The Ephori have tent a herald forth,
Charg'd with some solemn menace, and command
To fop the army's march.

LYSANDER.

If they obey,

The fane of Juno guards the king no more !
Eternal Gods! how wretched is LYSANDER !
From me that herald ihould have heard his answer.
Cannot my RHESUS find one gallant Spartan
To bear my orders to the royal band
To form the city ?

RHESUs.

I myself will bear
These orders to the camp.

LYSANDER.

Another task,

More difficult and dangerous, is thine.
Assume the arms and vesture of thy country,
And thro' the Thracians win thy way to AGIs.
RHESUs, the generous spirit of that prince
Is of a nature that excludes all fear,
Consideration, and refpe& of Self:
On earth he ats as if he were a God,
Immortal, and incapable of harm.
Think how the artful falsehood of AeliPHARES
May operate on such a royal mind.

[Enter a Thracian.

THRACIAN.
The Spartan lord draws near.

Enter AMPHARES.
How does the haughty captive brook confinement ?

Euxus.

Full of inquietude he seems, and sadness.
Now in some pensive posture fits a-while,
Then smites his breafd, and, starting from his feat,
Walks to and fro with a diforder'd pace.

AMPHARES.

Admit no Spartan of whatever sex,
Or whatfoe'er affinity they claim.

'uxus.
That firit command hath been already given.

AMPHARES.

'Tis needful, Euxus; for his furious mind,
In this extreme, will foatch at flight occasions
To make incredible and wild attempts.
Renew the charge; then go and search LYSANDE.I
For secret weapons. On hs breast he wears
A curious gorget, rich with precious stones,
And a small portrait of turpaffing beauty,

E t'rh

The image of the fair Athenian maid,
Drawn by an artist who has vied with nature
In sweet expreflion of her matchlefi charms:
That I mull have.

Euxus.
You shall without delay.

[Exit EuxuL

Manet AMPHARB.S.

Let other men deprive themselves of pleasure,
And toil for bare ambition; I'll provide
A more luxurious banquet to my tale.
What tho' as yet EUANTHE loves me not,
It is the nature of her sex to change.
With wondrous ease the female kind submit
To destiny; and soon are reconcil'd
To persons and conditions once abhorr'd.
Like birds new caught, who flutter for a time,
And struggle with captivity in vain;
But by-and-by they reft; .they smooth their plumes,
And to new masters sing their former notes.
This facle temper of the beauteous sex
Great Agamemnon, brave Pelides, prov'd:
They sack'd the cities, and they flew the fires,
The brothers, and the lovers of the fair,
Who weep'd awhile, then wip'd their watry eyes,
And loft their sorrows in the hero's arms.

Enter SANDANE.

The herald is return'd. The royal band,
Inflam'd with rage and scorn, the mandate tore;
And to the city bend their rapid march.

AMPHARES.

Let them advance. They halten to their fate.
A secret stratagem I have devis'd
To check these warriors in their bold career.

SAN-

SANDANE.
The Ephori in resolution faint_

AMPHARES,

Their courage I'll reltore; for AGis yields
To the fallacious counsellor I sent.
DEMOCHkRES, in sacerdotal robes,
As if difguis'd t' elude the Thracian guards,
Pat in by mypermflion, and conjur'd
Aois to quit the fane's uncertain shelter,
And seek the sure proteion of the camp:
Himself he offer'd as his faithful guide.
This in LYSANDER'S name. AGIs atfirt,
Irresolute and doubtful, balanc'd much:
At las this thought sprung up, and turn'd the scale
That his escape would force us to fubmillion,
And end the firife without the lhock of arms.
DEMOCHARES at midnight is appointed
To come again; and goes with an addition
That will give certain credence to his words;
The gorget of LYSANDER.

SANDANB.

sNow, AMPHARES,

I fee the snares of death are wrapt around him;
Our hated foe stands on the verge of fate:
He who defpis'd SANDNE, and permitted,
With moil insulting courtesy, my flay;
I would not have remain'd one day In Sparta,
But for the hope I had to work his ruin.
He is the root, with him the branches fall.

AMPHARES.

Altho' his son is safe in Orchomenos,
Yet there in hopeless exile he mau live.
But AGESISTRATA.

To re-affume his sceptre and his throne.

Shall h(rink beneath their awful monarch's sword.

Which man, like other animals, obeys.

As well as valour; they have seiz'd a spy,
Who' mix'd with them, difguis'd in Thracian arms.

Yes, to pafl to Ac s.

Some bold adventurer of the royal band,
Whose life-Why art thou troubled ? Has LYSANDbR

At the reproachftl terms, the bitter taunts,
Which I have fuffer'd from incens'd LYSANDEB,
In execution of thy late commands.

Against the rigour of those guilty laws,
Which bind a soldier blindly to obey.

And more than lhar'd, the first in hard extremes,
When signal danger claims a leader's sword.
No spoil, no treasure, have I e'er referv'd;
The wealth I covet is the soldier's love.

In this distress I'll throw myself on them,
They will support me.

Euxus.

I am fummon'd hence

To meet the Ephori. I fear, my lord,
They have difcover'd RHESUS is my brother.

LYSANDER.

That secret in your breast and his is lodg'd:
Nor can his alter'd features now betray him.
In early youth he left his native land;
The heat of summer, and the winter's cold,
In many a hard campaign, have chas'd his bloom.

Euxus.
Indeed, I knew him not.

LYSANDER.

Then who could know him

Calm and determin'd to the senate go:
Here 1ll remain, and wait your quick return.
To know what they design imports us much.

Euxus.
Your flay is full of danger; rifl it not.

LYSANDER.

All necessary dangers must be rifk'd.
Perhaps I am the subje&t of their councils,
Perhaps I may be call'd before the senate.
If I appear not, you muff be difcover'd,
And my escape too soon to them be known.

Euxus.

Your reasons are of force. I am convinc'd.
Here, take my sword. Then, if we are betray'd,
My troops obey you. Now, my bold SITHONTES,

And lead there Thracians to the tower that holds
My loft EUANTHE ? No, let reafonrule.

Whilst undecided is the fate of AGIS.
'Tis night, but never shall the morning rife
On-Who can know the secret will of heaven!

That light the counsels of eternal Jove,
Have you, since Time began his long career,
Beheld a mortal like LYSANDER toft ?
Down, down, enthusiasm 1 my heart be calm I
A little while, and thou fhalr beat no more.
Oft have I wish'd for perilous occasions;
And, wandring in the academic grove,
Have rous'd myself with strong imagination
Of great exploits by ardent valour done:
But ne'er did fancy's tempest match the truth,
The strong reality of such a Itorm.
O did I combat but for life alone,
Were Sparta and EUANTHE safe spectators,
How gaily /hould LYSANDER take the field.-
Euxus draws near-Upon the infe& wing
Of a fnall moment ride th' eternal fates.

Enter Euxus.

My fears were vain. The secret is unknown.
But RHESUS is condemn'd to die to-morrow.

LYSANDER.
To-morrow ! Ere tomorrow men hall die

Who

Who are not yet condemn'd.

Euxus.

'Tis true by heaven !

Mortal designs and enterprizes rife
On every fide. The Ephori resolve
At midnight to furprize the royal band,
And order'd me to hold my troops prepar'd
Their forces to fusain.

LYSANDIR.
'Tis well! 'tis wondrous well !

They urge me now, and point the line of action.
Under the high up-lifted arm of fate
I'll rush, and firike before their blow can fall.
I'll form the city while they force the camp.
Your troops--

My lord, the troops of nxatds have -revolted.
RHINALCES visited this night each pofi,
And near Anycla's gatre so Thracians met,
Whose leader, queflion'd, anfwer'd with his sword.

MESSRNOGEL

The sudden onset, and the cloud of night
The traitors favour'd; some efcap'd our swords,
But many more in the flarp combat fell,

AMPHAHES.

AMPHARES.
Did their fierce leader fall ?

MESSIENGER.

Above the reft

Conspicuous he fought.; at hJim each fvord
Was pointed. If he fell not on the spot,
Sure he received wounds that must fatal prove,

AYMHARES.

Confirm me that, and I will mock at fate.
Command my troops, that in the Forum watch,
To join RHINALC£S. I myilf will follow.

How beautiful sbe is ! Should he survive,
Those charms divine he never fiall enjoy.

EUANTHE.

Why haft thou call'd me hither to afflict
And torture me with fpefades of woe ?

Ibe Gate of the Prifin opens, and

A4MPHARES'S SLIve advances,

Eternal powers! Why yawn yon dreadful gates?
And from what horrid deed stalks yonder villain ?

MESSENGER.
Thy orders are obey'd. He lives no more.

EUANTHE.

Barbarian monster! haft thou kill'd LYSANDER ?-
But I will not reproach thee, nor complain
To the regardless Gods. My doom is palt;
There is one only refuge for EUANTHE.
Once more I follow where LYSANDER leads,
Where murder and AMPHARES cannot come,
To part us more.

There is no leisure now for lamentation.
Forthwith conduct her to th' Arcadian gate:
There with the horsemen wait.

My enemy prevails.-This way with me.
My fReps pursue, or by the Gods of Hell !-

I will not leave this place. Draw forth thy sword,
And try if death can terrify despair.

Infernal dog, turn and behold LYSANDER.
Fly, RHESUS, to the king. Traitor accurfit ! Exit RHESUS.
Down, down, to Tartarus; there, villain, howl.

Amazing powers ! alive! vi&orious! Oh!

And have I come to save thee, O EUANTH E
But oh ! I fear, I come too late for AGIs.

The dungeon-mouth is open. Enter RHESUS.

Tell me, RHESUS.

RHESUS.
The king is murder'di in yon vault he lies.

LYSANDER.

My prince ! my friend ! thy goodness, and thy virtue,
Thy clemency, thy mildness, have undone thee!
Fatal to nations is the dread example !
Hence monarchs, who with iron sceptre rule,
Will justify their treatment of mankind;
And virtuous princes, born in evil times,
Will hesitate to ftem corruption's tide,
Left they ihould be like AGIS overwhelm'd.

AMPHARES.

He who preferr'd LYSANDER to AMPHARES,
Has paid me with his life. My dying hand
Hath sow'd the feeds of discord and distraction.
Peace ne'er shall dwell in Sparta. Plagues on plagues
Shall rife to curse you, as- (Dies.)

LYSANDER.

Thy foul is curs.

There the fell spirit of AMPHARES fled
In imprecations. Prophet of disasters,
Upon the dismal banks of Acheron,
Amidst the wailing ghosts, still curse thy country,
And end a speech the damn'd will hate to hear. -
Behold the mother of our murder'd king.

Enter AGESISTRATA and Euxus.

AGESISTRATA.

Alas ! I need not a;k the fate of Ac s:
Your looks, your silence fay, I have no son !
Yet speak to me, for I can hear the worst,
I have been long familiar with affliction;
I am the widow of the fire of AGIs.

F 2 LY-

LYSANDER.

There lies the bloody author of his death
Slain by my band.

AGESISTRATA.
Alas ! alas! my son!

Oft has my anxious mind this hour foreseen,
And warn'd thee oft. But thou the danger fcorn'd,
When Sparta's glory was the price of peril.
0 ! son of Jove, great author of our race,
Sustain my foul. For he who was my flay,
My comfort, and my strength, is now no moie.
Yet in the path his generous spirit chafe,
He fell; and confclous virtue crown'd his fall.

LYSANDER.
So fell not false AMPHARES.

Euxus.

And SANDANE.

LYSANDER.
SANDANE dead!

Euxus.

And dreadful was her death.

She fled, for refuge from the people's rage,
To the fame turret where AMPHARES' troops
Guarded the queen, whose mantle on the ground
She spied, and wrapt it round her wretched head;
When suddenly a stern affafin came,
And stabb'd her, as that queen whole robe (he wore.
Arriving then, I heard her shriek for help,
I;plore her country's Gods, with bitter cries,
And, in her agony divulge her crimes.
It was no wonder that (he sear'd to die.

AGESISTRATA.

0 pui!; ! thou'rt worst of all; he knew thee not,
For whom I mourn. Untimely was his fate;
` et fuli of high and picafing thoughts he fell.

(;-,,:2'

Great-hearted Virtue, in its fweling hour,
Scarce feels the blow that strikes at brittle life.
The painful part is mine, in grief to live.
Would I had dy'd for thee, mty foa ! my son!

EUANTHE.

EUANTHE'S tears shall ever flow with yours,
For her prote&or'and her gentle friend.
Mysterious air the counsels of the Gods;
Together AGIS and ANPRARES fall.

LYSANDER.

The son of AGIS lives, his infant years
Require a mother's care. Without delay
Proclaim the son of AGIs king of Sparta.
To him, the offspririg of my prince ador'd,
Descend the love and faith I bore to AGIS.
Ye generous Thracians, who this day have shewn
The matchless worth and honour of your minds,
Henceforth be Spartans. And, ye Spartan youths
Whom AGIS lov'd, and for whose rights he died,
Display the spirit of your dear-bought freedom;
With grateful valour guard the hero's son,
And prove that AGIS perilh'd not in vain.

AGESISTRATA.
Conduct me, Spartans, to his dear remains.

LYSANDER.
Forbear awhile yon dismal vault.-Enter MESSENGeR.

MESSENGER.

My Lord,

The people, headed by the priests of Jove
And Hercules, in long procession come,
Bearing the body of their royal lord,
From that base dungeon to the fculptur'd tomb
Which guards the sacred dust of Sparta's kings.

Enter the Proeftfio with

the Bed)' of AGIS.

LYSANDER.
O Destiny supreme!

EVANTHr,

0 fad remains
Of youth and majely !

AGESISTRATA.
My ion ! my son !

Nature is thwarted here; thou ihouldfl have borne
Thy aged parent to the silent tomb.

CHORUS.

Mourn, ye sons of Sparta, mourn,
Pour the fad lamenting strain.
Wretched people! Land forlorn!
Mourn the best of princes slain.

Priest of JUPITER.

He fell not as the warrior fails,
WhUfe breast defends his native walls.
To treason Agis bow'd his head,
And by his guilty subje&s bled:
Betray'd by those his mercy spar'd;
Ingratitude was his reward.

CHORUS.

Shame is mix'd with Sparta's woe,
Blood of kings the city stains.
Ever let our sorrows flow,
Shame indelible remains.

Priest of JUPITER.

Yet AGIs triumph'd in his fall;
For Virtue triumphs over all:
Great, superior to his fate,
He only griev'd for Sparta's slate.
When Jove decrees a nation's doom,
He calls their heroes to the tomb.
Fearless they fall, immortal rife,
And claim the freedom of the skies.

CHORUS.

C H' RU S.

AGIS triumph'd in his fall,
Virtue triumphs over all 1
Such a king Ihall ne'er return:
Our country and ourselves we mourn.

Priest of HERCULES.

Aois fell, by fraud o'ercome;
Alike was great Alcides' doom.
Yet then moll worthy of his fire,
The son of Jove, when wrapt in fire,
Vitorious crown'd his labours pat:
His noblest labour was the lalt.

CHORus of all.

Now in peace our hero lies,
Ceas'd his toil, his race is run;
Freedom is the glorious prize
Agis for his people won,

King in bloom of youtb, for freedom die

..l£ Our bard, tho' bld, durJt not have J3oarl'dfg igh.
This is no credulous admiring age;
But sacred ure thefaith of Plutarch's page.
In fimpleflile that antientfage relates
The tale of Sparta, chief of Grecian lates:
Eight hundred years itflourifh'd, great in arms,
On dangers rose, and grae ami.dfi alarmis.
Of Sparta's triumph you have heard the cazfe,
Morelrong, more noble than Lycurgus laws:
Hlow Spartan Dames, by glory's charms in/pir'd
Thefon, the lover, and the hufaqdf i'd.
re Fair of Britain's isle, whicbh ijfl clai;is
The Grrcian title, land of 'ovely dames,
In Britain's cause exert wour matchless charms,
And rouse your lovers to tbh love of arms.
Hid, not extinc7, tbe spark of valour lies;
Your breathjhallraie it flaming to tbeJkies.
Now Mars his bloody banner hangs in air,
And bids Britannia's JIns fir war prepare.
Let.each lov'd maid, each mother bring the Jbi t1,
And arm their country's champions fr the si ld.
Arin'd and inJiam''d each :Britifl breafJ2lall burn,
No youth unlaurel'djhall to you return.
Then/hall we cease t' exult at trophies won,
In glory's field, by Heroes-not our own.
France yetjhall tremble at the BritiJ/fi;wrd,
And dread the Vengeanme of bhr antient Lord.
