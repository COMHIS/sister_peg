ACT I. SCENE I.
A court and hall, common to the palaces of the kings

of SPARTA.

Enter SANDANE attcnded.
H A S T E N, ORONTES, to the senate house,

And learn if rumor's voice has spoke the truth.

[Exit .dttendant.

The adverse fortune of an exil'd king
Pursues my lord. Achaia's generous aid
Sultains his cause in vain. Why risk a battle,
When the continuance of defensive war
Secur'd success and vitory in Sparta ?
Would I had never left thy splendid court,
Delightful Sardis ! to be Sparta's queen.

Enter AMPHARES.
yWelcome, AMP ;AR ES! Have the armies met ?

B

AMPHARES.

They have. This morning, at the break of day,
The Spartan army charged Achaia's host.
This and no more is known. Suspense and fear
Possess the people; to the gates they run,
Then to their honfes: the fiill whisper spreads
Thro' jultling multitudes the dread alarm.

SANDANE.

Alas ! revenge and empire now depend
Oa the wild ilfue of unruly war.
What if the arms of AGIs should prevail ?

AMPHARES.

Although he fhouid, the toils of fate surround him.
Dauntldes and firm our brave associates fairtd,
And with impatience wait the de.tin'd hour
To rnfh on AGIs. This unlook'd-for battle
Is but a solemn prelude to the a&t,
Which bo!d conspiracy will soon perform.
This day thall terminate the reign of AGIs,
And make, 0 Queen ! all payer in Sparta thine.

SANDANE.

I fee that danger only whets the brave.
But yet, AMPHARES, if my lord is vanqui(h'd,
Will not the conquering army awe the city ?

AIM P HABE S.

Acis (hall be the surety of our cause,
And hoflage for our safety, till we wrefd
The ftword from proud LYSASDER, if l;e conquers;
But that I fear not much. New to command
From idle Athens the mock hero comes,
Starts up a foldicr, and a statesman too;
Each palm he cl-ims: All honours must adorn
The chosen friend of vilfionary AGIS.

SANDANE.

May Mars direlt him so to guide the war,
As AG1I rules the fiate: And mutiny

Prore

Prove there as fatal as sedition here.

AMPHARES.

This fatious state must change its feeble forms
Waver no more beneath a double reign
Of limited, contending, useless kings.
Henceforth our monarch fliall in Sparta rule,
As Jove alone in high Olympus reigns.

SANDANE.

S reign the mighty monarchs of the Eafl;
And such imperial power, I thought, belong'd
To Sparta's king, else I had ne'er been queen.
Young, and deceiv'd, I left my father's court
For Laced.emon's miserable sceptre.
I did endeavour to extend its sway,
And to ambition rous'd my Spartan lord.
But the vain pupil of the Grecian schools,
Unprincely AGIS, marr'd the brave design.
Chief of the multitude, idol and save
Of the base populace, he led the herd,
He urged their brutal fury on the king.

AMPHARES.

And now their fury on himself recoils.
Like the unruly elephant, they turn,
And trample down the ranks in which they fought.

SANDANE.
That is their Liberty.

AMPHARES.
Let us employ,

And then suppress, such formidable licence.
My magifiracy now is near expir'd;
A king's resentment and iival's hate
Have long hung over my devoted head:
Farewel to place, to dignity, and power,
Whilst haughty AGIS fills the Spartan throne.
I will not live obscure in Lacedzmon,
Nor roam thro' Grecian states a baniih'd maw

B2 If

If I mufl set, to rife and fline no more,
A fiery track shall mark my setting fun.
But AGIS cqmes

SANDANE.

And AGESISTRATA.

Farewel ! Success attend thee, brave AMPHARES !
I will not flay. My foul didains to hide
Its hatred or its scorn. [Exit SAN DAN E.

AMPHARES.
Yet they who mean

To gratify these paifions, must conceal them.
This day decides my fate. So let it be,
Such brief conclusion have I ever lov'd.
Afifti me, Hermes, God of firatagem,
With artful words, to sooth the mind of AGIS,
And turn him from the track my purpose holds.

Enter AcIS and AGESISTRATA.

AGESISTRATA.
Alas, my son i that bold bad man I dread!

AGIs.

He seems to wait us. At this hour, AMPHAPRES,
I think that thou of all men fhou'dft have ihunn'd me.

AMPHARES.

My motive in attending here your presence
Merits a less injurious salutation.

AGIS.

I know thy merits, and I will reward them.
Art thou not author of the woes of Sparta,
Prime mover and inflamer of feditdn ?
Has thou not bent the power of thy high office
To the subversion of the Rtate thou ferv'ft ?
At thee this day my indignation burns.
I am difhonour'd

. -_ AM'

AMPHARES.

What has diihonour'd thee?
AGIS.

Thou and thy pracices, they have compell'd me
To leave the noblest flation of a prince.
In time of war where should a king be found
But at his army's head ? There AGcs (lood,
When you and your presumptuous Ephori
Required my pretence here. Ungrateful Spartans!
Had you allow'd me but one other day,
Then had I fought this battle for my country,
And died or conquer'd with her bravelt sons.

AGFESISTRATA.

Peril, my son ! dwells not in camps alone:
In cities, palaces, and courts ofjuftice,
With treachery and treason she inhabits.
Peril attended thus thou muffll encounter,
More hideous sure than in the ranks of war.

A.MPHARES.

I know my ations have incens'd the king.
But I imagin'd not that such suspicions
Found entertainment in your royal breafrs ?

AGIS.

Halt thou notjois'd the enemies of AGIS ?
Thou who waft- once his friend, incontfant man.

AMPHARES.

I have oppos'd the counsel of a foe,
Whose arts depiiv'd me of my prince's favour.,

AGis.

Thou haft oppo'd LYCURGUS and the laws,
Which rais'd the name of Sparta to the Ikies.
The Delphic God infpir'd the deep design:
For more than human was that power of thought
Which join'd the public to the private good,
With such perfection, that each selfish pallion
flow'd i; the channel of the common welfare,.

B 3 And.

And, like one family of sons and fires,
And dearest brothers, a great people liv'd.
In peace they liv'd without or frife or scorn,
In war they fought to conquer, or to die.
Equal and free, our happy fathers knew
No interest but the interelf of the fiate;
No gain but Sparta's glory; proud they bore
That palm aloft, and shar'd the high refpet,
The admiration, which consenting Greece
Paid to th' imperial virtue of their country.

AMPHARES.

Revolving time that fyflem overthrew,
And chang'd the manners and the laws of Sparta.

AGIS.

The laws have been negleted, not annull'd,
And corrupt rulers have corrupted manners.
Authority will soon revive the laws,
And great example yet retfore the manners,
In spite of those who have opprefs'd their country,
Depriv'd the people of their antient rights,
And while the nation funk beneath their sway,
Still strove for power in a declining kingdom,
Still fought for wealth in an impoverifh'd land.
Even at this hour rapacious they persist,
And, like some wretches in a firanded vessel,
Plunder and riot in the midst of ruin.

AMPHARES.

Mov'd by the present perils of the Rtate,
This signal hour I chose, unknown as yet
The fortune of the field, to change my condu&,
And make an offer of my aid to AGIS.

AGIS.

If I mfould judge the future by the palt,
Thou mull forgive me, tho' I doubt thy faith.

AGE.

AGESI STRATA.

Yet hear him, Ac s: in an hour like this
He who aliflance offers is a friend.

AGIS.

This hour may yet deceive their countrys foes.
I know the base foundation of tlht hope
Which makes my baffled enemies presume.
LYSANDER'S army in its ranks contains
The best and bravest of Laconia's sons;
The fac&ion with and hope defeat to them,
That Sparta's generous youth may ne'er return
To guard that freedom which has made them brave.

AMPHARES.

The boldness of their hopes their deeds will prove
In the assembly, if Achaia conquer.

AGESISTRATA.
AMPHARES, fay, what is their utmost aim ?

AMPH ARES.

The old dependants of the exil'd king,
And all the venal members of the state,
Won by SANDANE'S arts and foreign gold,
Aim to reflore LEONIDAS, who comes
With hostile armies to enslave his country:
Therefore SANDAN E'S proffers I rejeted,
Have warn'd the king, and would have serv'd him too;
But since resentment and difiruft prevent me,
Neutral I fiand, and will not leek that welcome
Which his more artful enemies would give.

AGIS.

Thou fpeak'ft more boldly than becomes Am. PHAR E..
Add that to the offences I forgive.
It is the sacred maxim of my reign,
That in a prince's consecrated breast
Revenge and anger should not long remain.
These paflions in a king affli& the fate,
By driving ralh offenders to despair.

64 Tte

This day decides your charactr with me.
Now let your aAions prove your words sincere.

AMPHARES.

No other terms I ak-, and sure I am
Ne'er Mhal AMFJlRES need again forgiveness.

[Exit AMPHARES.
Manent Acis and AGESISTRATA.

AGIS.

Well has he judg'd the season of submission.
He will afift us if LYSANDER conquers.

AGESISTRATA.

May Jove avert the evils which I fear !
I dread the ruin of the Spartan faite,
And fear the downfal of our antient house.
The blackest fury of the Stygian realm,
The moll destruCtive, is infernal Discord.
Bath'd in the blood of kings she walks this world,
And tumbles hates and empires to the ground.

AGIS.

Nations oft perish by their princes crime;
But now if Sparta's antient state must fall,
Gods and good men (hall witness for its king,
That he with fate contended for his people,
And on the ruins of their virtue fell.

AGESISTRATA.

Think not I mean to blame your high design,
Age has not chang'd the tenor of my mind,
Nor pali'd my admiration of true glory.
Sprung, like thy father, from Alcides' blood,
I feel the spirit of the Spartan line.
Only let me adjure thee to beware,
And walk with caution thro' surrounding perils.
Tho' thou defpifeft every form of danger,
Think what a helpless train attends on thee,
An aged mother, and an infant son.

AGIS.

AGIS.
Divine Alcides will prote& his race.

AGESISTRATA.

I will invoke the God; in times like there
Prayers are the arms of our defenceless sex.
A spotless choir of matrons and of virgins,
Who o'er their country mourn, myelf will lead
To the high temple of the son of Jove.
lHe yet may hear the voice of Supplication,
And fIretch his arm to save the Spartan slate.

[Exit AGESISTRATA.

AGIS al;ne.

Without, the enemy; within, the faction.
What (hou'd I think ? I have a thousand thoughts
That rife and fall like waves upon the ihore.
I need thee now, LYSANDER ! 0 my friend
I lean on thee, and thou perhaps art fall'n.
Ye ever-living gods, who know my heart,
I trult in you, for righteous are my thoughts,
All bent on raising up long-proltrate Sparta.
With Sparta too, I would be proud to rife,
And gain such glory as my fathers gain'd,
When Persia's tyrant trembled at their arms.
If in this juil ambition I Ihould perish,
My name fliall go to nations yet unborn.
But I mull change my firain; EUANTHE comes.
Alas, LYSANDER, led by love and thee,
She left her Athens for this land of broils.

Enter EUANTHE.

EUANTHE.
No tidings from the camp ?

AGIS.

None, fair EUANTHE.
If we had loft the field, the flying rout

Ere

Ere this had reach'd our gates.

EUANTHE.

Oh! many a dame,

Matron and virgin, tremble at this hour;
But who has cause like mine ? The most forlorn
And desolate of women is EUANTHE !
If

AGIS.

Small the chance of what EUANTHE fears:

In the long wars of ftill-contending Greece
Leaders of armies have but rarely fallen.

EUANTHE.

One thing I know, and with prophetic tongue
I speak it, Prince ! if Sparta triumph not,
Ne'er ihall your eyes again behold LYSANDER.
Disdain in him is fatal as despair.

AGIs.

When he returns viCorious from the field,
Then (hall he hear who befl has spoke his praise.
But I mnlt leave you now: The senate waits me.
Hereafter we (hall speak of this, and smile
Like mariners who on the peaceful (hore
Sit, and with pleasure talk of tempests past.

[Exit AGIs.

EUANTHE alone.

This stedfast ease is all aftum'd, I fee;
He flaggers at the imminent event.
How dreadful is this interval to me,
Who am bereft and destitute of all
Those aids that flay affliion; and mufl bear
The weight of woe that's heavier every hour.
The queen, and generous AGIS too, discharge
The dues of kindred with unfeigned love.
But our acquaintance is not old enough
To yield a ripen'd sympathy, whose taste
Alone can comfort such a mind as mine.
Yet I repent me not in this extreme,

That

That I forrook my country and my friends.
They would have forc'd me to a loathed bed,
And torn me from the noblest of mankind.
If he should fall I my love ! my only love !
Shall I survive thee; and return to Athens,
Be humbled there before my haughty kindred,
And hear them blame the ashes of LYSANDER?
Forbid it, fearless love ! forbid it, shame !
Forbid it, honour, and my nature's pride;
Death ihall forbid it, for I dare to die.

Enter RHESUS.

EUANTJIE.
RHESUS, Great Gods! Oh fay, how fares LYSANDER ?

RHESUS.
As well as glorious victory can make him,

EUANTHE.

Forgive my rash derpair, my thanks accept,
Ye gracious powers who guard his daring brealt.
Where is he now ?

RHESUS.

With AGIs in the senate.

EUANTHE.
Already here; blclt be the Gods of Greece!

RHESUS.

Soon as the trumpet from pursuit recall'd
Our conquering Spartans, in the field arriv'd
A weary messenger, by AGIS lent;
LYSANDER firait bespoke the royal band;
" With all the speed of men to Sparta hafe,
" Chastise bold treason, and defend your king,"
He said; and call'd to me. With a few horse
I follow'd him: And when he fought the king,
By his command to you I brought these tidings.

EUANTHE.
Most welcome RHESUS. But has Sparta lolt

None

None of her nobk youth ?

RHESuS.

No man of note

Fell in the field but one, whofie loss you'll mourn,
LYSANDER'S friend, Athenian POLYDORUS.

EUANTHE.

Alas alas ! my joy is mix'd with woe.
Unhappy youth ! on my ill-omen'd head
The blame of thy untimely death will fall.
Condufting me, thou cam'!l to distant Sparta.
Fatal the honours Sparta's king beftow'd
Upon the generous guardian of EUANTHE.

RHESUS.

Lady, the people of my native land,
The warlike Thradans, hold it vain to mourn
For men who fall in battle; filch they deem
The favourites of MARs, our country's God.
Those they bewail who die by dire disease,
Of youth and vigor full. But most of all
Lament old men, who drink the bitter dregs
Of life and woe, and in decrepit age
(Extreaity of dotage) wiih to live.

EUANTHE.

Who arc those men who near the temple stand i
Uncouth to me their garb, and strange their arms.

RHESUS.
They are Thracians, lady.
EUANTHE.
What feekthey here?

RHESUS.

And learn his buglis.

Depend on the unwearied zeal of RHESUS.

And Ihare the triumphs of the man I love,

LYSANDER.
0 my life! my love !

To meet thee here is happiness complcat.
The Gods have blest me to my utmost wish,
And brought me full of glory to EUINTHE.

EUANTHE.

Thanks to the Gods who have preferv'd LYSANDER.
Athenian Pal4s sure has heard my prayers.

LYSANDER.

And mine; for mutual if the lover's prayer.
Another deity I now invoke,
Whose rites the god of war has long delay'd,
With peace well-pleas'd Jhall golden Hymen come,
And crown at last our long eventful love.

EUANTHE.

Speak not of Hymen now: his torch for me

Her

Her horrid brand, and whillt unburied lies
Thy friend and mine, the generous POLYDORUS.

LYSANDER.

Tho' love and glory both my breast inspire,
And fortune smiles on both, yet sorrow finds
A place to fit in: but 'tis temper'd sorrow;
For never Grecian hero greater died,

EUANTHE.

He fell the vi&tim of his love to thee;
He follow'd thee when thou forfook'ft EUANTHE,
Left me the day I touch'd the Spartan Ihore,
Tho' royal AGIS begg'd thee to remain.

LYSANDER.

Unjust EUANTHE, thus to blame LYSANDER
Who fought the field, the soldier of his love
As of his sacred country: fought to gain,
With liberty, a rank and place of honour,
Such as becomes the husband of EUANTHE;
That tender name, and names that wait upon it,
Awake emotions as implacable
To tyranny, asgenerous and great,
As ever felf-renouncing hero own'd.
When the chief aim is right, all passions elf#
Of noble kind impell the self-same way.
The lover and the hulband rouse and fire
The Spartan and the man.
Of common clay, and in one common mould
Mankind are made; but the celestial fire
That gives them life and foul, is liberty.
And I, Prometheus like, to gain that fire
For Sparta's sons, would brave the bolt of Jove.

EUANTHE.

To me you need not vaunt your daring mind.
Alas! LYSANDER ! I am flill afraid
Of perils lurking in this troubled late.
O leave me not again to grief and fear,

And

And to AMrHARnrs.

LYSANDER.
Leavc thee to AMriH.RrLs
EUANTHE.

Yes, in thy absence he did talk of lore,
Boasted his wealth, his clients, and his power;
Mention'd the ruin of thy father's fortunes,
And spoke contemptuous of thy rash designs.

LYSANDER.

Immortal gods! Did I not hate this man
Enough ?

Enter a HELOT.

Helot, return, and tell the noble dame
That the remembrance of her generous mind
Shall live for ever in my grateful breast.

EUANTHE.
Who is this faithful friend ?

LYSANDER.

A Spartan dame,

A gentle one, tho' wedded to a foe
Of royal AGIS. In her virgin slate
She was the coaftant and the lov'd companion
Of fair DEIDAMIA, AGIS' liort-liv'd queen.
Thro' all our various firife, the generous dame
Preserves the friendships of her early days.
This scroll the king muit fee. Farcwel, EUASTHE.

EU ANTHE.
Its threatning ftraia awakes my former fearn.

tWoulJl

Would you had been, like me, content with love,
And never left Illyflus' flowery banks !
A fairer garland there you might have won,
Than ever war beftow'd, th' immortal wreath
Of PALLAS, queen of arts as well as arms.
But you forsook the vale, and left the lhade
To climb ambition's bare and rocky height,
To stand the forms and tempests of the world.

LYSANDER.

Your words, like melancholy music, take
My lilt'ning ear, and cause delusive sadness;
For vain the malice of our baffled foes,
And impotent will prove their last endeavours;
Past are the forms and tempests of our fortune;
Let not EUANTHE heed the rack of clouds,
Nor dread the murmurs of the falling main.

EUANTHE.

Elate with vicory, you scorn your foes.
I wish that RHESUS would return again
Before you go to AGIs.

LYSANDER.

Where is RHESUS?

EUANTHE.

I saw some warriors clad in horrid arms
Near yonder temple itand. Strait RHESUs knew
The garb and arms of his own native Thrace,
And, wond'ring at the fight, went forth to learn
Who and from whence they were.

LYSANDER.

That should be known.

In yonder temple fit the Ephori,
Those factious magifirates who love not AGIs.
If RHEsus come to you, detain him not;
Our resolutions may on him depend.

EUANTHE.
LXSANDER, flay; you go again to AGIs,

C Per.

Perhaps to plan new perils to thy life;
If so, by all that's facred.II conjure' thee
To let me know your purpose. Speak with me
Before you exeute .what you cefolve.
The image of the stern AMPr.RES. haunts me;
Need I entreat thee to defend -me'from him.

LY3ANDER.

No ! by the God; ! -0 urge me not, EXrANTHE !
,Nor rouse those thoughts a lover cannot bear.
Defend thee from AMPHARES ! 0 my fair !
When thou art woeg'd, LYSAnDER lives no more !
But fee the king.

EUASTHE.

Let caution shew your love.
LYSANDER gies of towards that fide

Inhiructed in the counsels of thy foes.
B&hold the ftedfafi faith of CELMENE.

AGIS.

I cannot think so basely of the people.
For them I have unplum'd the regal power,
And deck'd their freedom with the spoils of kings.
If they betray me; of all creatures, man
Is mollt ungrateful to his benefaCtor.

The generous courser and the faithful dog
With true affeEion love their gentle mater;
Nay even the heavy ox, the flubborn mule,
Dullest of beafs, they know the hand that feeds them.

LYSANDER.

Humanity lives in thy brealt, 0 king !
And ditates confidence unlimited;
Virtue approves the generous extreme,
And magnanimity this error loves.
Let private men indulge the glorious fault,
And set their lives and fortunes on the faith
And gratitude of those they have oblig'd;
But let feverer prudence guard the heart
Of him whose brows are circled with a crown.

O King ! the captain of Amycla's gate
Informs you that he has this hour descried
A band of men who halted near his post;
A thousand Thracians, they report themselves,
Hir'd by AMPHARES for SELEUC0S' service.

And levell'd their dfigns.

LTSANDER.

Yet if. they dare -,;

The worst of crimes, their treafon-may succeed.
Your troops, your conquering troops, are not arriv'd;
Th' assembly meets; unguarded there you sand;
What keeps the traitors from ypur. noble life ?

AGIS.

My life! LYSASNDR. No, I fear not that.
The andent annals of this land record,
That barbarous foes revere the race divine,
And turn in battle from a Spartan king.

LYSANDER.

The multitude may flill revere their 'lord
Who from the blood of great Alcides springs;
And vet some impious hand. may strike the prince,
Altho' of virtue as of race divine.

Some men of trust.

And wish for nothing but their king to lead them,

Your foes to rife in-arms, tlt arms decide.

That I am fill in Athens, From the herald
I kept my name .nd quality conceal'd;
For I fufpecfed that these Thracian troops,
Though hir'd for Asia, were for Sparta meant.
If it prove so, I may be useful here:
My valiant brother bears a generous mind,
And, tho' of arms enamour'd, justice loves.

AGIS.

Halle to your Valiant brother, and explain,
With an impartial tongue, the slate of Sparta.
Shew him where uRfice, and where honour stand,
If these are sacred, as thou fayftl they are,
To gallant Eusus he may prove a friend.

LYSANDERt.

Exert the strong persuasion of a brother;
And tell him, Rps.us, if he loves bright arms,
And that immortal glory valour gains,
No more to wvield .i mercenary iword,
But plant himfeif with thee in Sparta's foil,
Where Ac i s will his noble nature cherish,
And rear his courage to such lofty deeds,
As astient story tells of Sparta's chiefs. [Exit RHESsu.

AGIS.

I hope that RtHEstS wiil divide the Thracians.:
This favours well the biass of mry mind,
Averss to leave the diry on suspicion,
And drive the wavering facrtion to extremes.

LYSANDER.

O generous prince ! whom I admire and blame.
The greatcft foe, the foe LYSANDER dreads
Is the unequall'd gentlenese of Acis.

And let the vices of their children live
To kill the virtues. Hence, let Al lear ;'

Uncertain is the peril if I flay,
But certain is the evil if I fly.
I will remain; but toaffluremy safety,
You must, LYSANDER, 'to the troops return,

This victory, and the approaching host,
Will hush the threatned storm.

But there Is fomethlng in my heart rebels
Againfit this counsel! Oh ! I cannot leave you---
Nor ought I now to flay. Let never man
Say in the morning that the day's his own:
Things past belong to memory alone;
Things future are the property of hope.
The narrow line, the ifthmus.of these seas,
The infltant scarce divisible, is all ..
That mortals have to sand on. 0 my prince !
LYSANDER leaves you with a heavy heart.

Dear as the brother of his blood-to AGIS !

Ha ! may heaven your purpose change !

AGIS.

,My xwill is six'd. Buit though myjudgment too
Confirms the secret counsel of my heart,
Yet I may be decciv'd; perhaps, my friend,
We part this moment ne'er to-meet again.

LYSA lgDER.

Let us not part at all. 'Tis inspiration,
The guardian God, the Demon of the mind,
Thus often presses on the human:breaft.

AGIS.

Mistake me not; I-l feelno new impression,
Nor if I did, Ihould I by that be :alter'd;
For such presages, be they fad or joyful,
I deem them but the meteors of the mind,
Bred by the inward elemental firife,
When great events perplex and shake the foul.
My thoughts regard the state. If I [hould fall,
To thee, LYSANDER, I commit my son,
The only pledge of my DSIDA IIA's love.

Train up the boy to walk in the fame path
Which we have trdd together, thefitreight path
Of virtue and trueglory. If he proves
Of noble nature, and I hope no less,
He will not shun the. lofty path of honour,
Tho' fate fhould,nark it with his father's blood.

LYSANDER.

Hear this, immortal Gods! who rule the world,
And guard a prince the image of yourselves!
O never, never may his royal race
LYSANDER'S aid require. [Exit LYSANDER.

AGIS alone.

Affetion choaks his words,

His generous heart bursts at this solemn parting.
In times like these of a declining state,
Baseness insets the general race of men;
But yet these trying times rear upa few
More excellent, refin'd, and conscious spirits,
More principled, and fit for all events,
Than any in the good, but equal, mass
Of a far better age. Such is LYSANDER.

And thinks, would to the Gods he thought aright r
That his LYSANDER heads the Spartan troops,
In whom his only hope of safety lies.
But I, EUANTHE ! partial to thy will,
Sought thee in vain. In that unhappy time
They seiz'd the gates, and shut me up in Sparta.

Sound thro' my breast, and from my beating heart
Their echo rings. Farewel! my love, farewel!

And Sparta too. Does duty, or does honour,
Require LYSANDER, like an eastern slave,
To fall attendant on the royal pile ?
What can you do ? The army will betray you:
So with the few, the faithful few that love you,
You'll do some desperate action, and be slain.

For none that thou can'st give. Hear me, then judge,
If what I speak is meant to win. thy faivour.
I mhould have pitied thee by fate subdued:
Opprect with crimes,. thy spirit would hlve fhrunli
Under calamity, and guilt have marr'd
The noble vigor and the' port of manhood.

To think thou ow'flt it to excess of baienefs ?

Such as fond lovers lavilhly employ
To sooth the pangs of parting and of absence.

Charg'd with some solemn menace, and command
To flop the army's march.

LTSANDE:

If they obety,

The fane of Juno guards the king no more !
Eternal God ! how wretched is LYSANDER !
From me that herald Ihould have heard his answer;
Cannot my RHEsUs find one gallant Spartan
To bear my orders to the royal band
To ftonn the city ?

RHesus.

I myself will bear
These orders to the camp.

LYSANDER.

Another talk&

More diffieult and dangerous, is thine.
Afiame the arms and veutnre of thy country,
And thro' the Thracians win thy way' to AOIS.
RHESUS, the generous spirit of that prince
Is of a nature that excludes all fear,
Consideration, and refpeft of Self:
On earth he a&ts as if he were a God,
Immortal, and incapable of harm.
Think how the artful falsehood of AMPHARES
May operate on such a royal mind.

AMPHARES.

Or whatfoe'er affinity they claim.

Euxus.

AMPHARES.

'Tis needful, Euxus; for his furious mind,
In this extreme, will snatch at flight occasions
To make incredible and wild attempts.
Renew the charge ;. then go and search LYSANDEK
For secret weapons. On his breast he wears
A curious gorget, rich with precious stones,
And a fimll portrait of furpafling beauty,

Drawn by an artist who has vied with nature
In sweet expression of her matchless charms:
That I muit have.

MJLtnet AMPHARES.

Let other men deprive themselves of pleasure,
And toil for bare ambition; I'll provide
A more luxurious banquet to my tafle.
What tho' as yet EUANTHE loves me not,
it is the nature of her sex to change.
With wondrous ease the female kind submit
To destiny; and soon are reconcil'd
To persons and conditions once abhorr'd.
Like birds new caught, who flutter for a time,
And struggle with captivity in vain;
But by-and by they reft; they smooth their plumes,
And to new mailers sing their former notes.
This facile temper of the beauteous sex
Great Agamemnon, brave Pelides, prov'd:
They sack'd the cities, and they flew the fires,
The brothers, and the lovers of the fair,
Who weep'd awhile, then wip'd their watry eyes,
And loBt their sorrows in the hero's arms.

Er ter SANDANE.

The herald is return'd. The royal band,
Inflam'd with rage and scorn, the mandate tore;
And to the city bend their rapid march.

To check these warriors ia their bold career.

As if difguis'd t' elude the Thracian guards,
Past in by my permiflion, and conjur'd
Acts to quit the fane's uncertain shelter,
And seek the sure protection of the camp:
Himself he offer'd as his faithful guide.
This in LYSANDER'S name. AGIs at first,
Irresolute and doubtful, balanc'd much:
At las this thought (prung up, and turn'd the scale:
That his escape would force us to fubmiflion,
And end the strife without the Ihock of arms.
DEMOCHARES at midnight is appointed
To come again; and goes with an addition
That will give certain credence to his words;
The gorget of LYSANDER.

SANDANB.

Now, AMPHARES,

I fee the snares of death are wrapt around him;
Our hated foe stands on the verge of fate:
He who defpis'd SANDANE, and permitted,
With most insulting courtesy, my flay;
I would not have remain'd one day in Sparta,
But for the hope I had to work his ruin.
He is the root, with him the branches fall.

Bore down the people, and oppreft your prince,
Whom death delivers. AGIS lhall not fee
The lait convulsions of expiring Freedom.
For in the first he dies.

AMPHARES.
We'll hear no more

Of these invectives. Bear him to the place
Of execution. Officers, advance
And do your duty.

OFFICERS.
This is not our duty.

A;,iPHA.RES.

AMPHARES.
What!

OFFICERS.
Murder of a king is not our duty.

AMIPHARES.

Mutinous flares! for you I'll find a time.
Sir. [To AGIS.]

AGIS.

Touch me not, for uncompell'd I go

To meet my defliny. Weep not for me, [To an sier.
0 ! thou whose nature suits not thy employment,
Weep not for me! I would not change conditions
With these bad men. I hall not feel the woes
That thou and all mull feel, the woes of Sparta !
0 ! might my death avail my much-lov'd country,
I'd die as joyful then, as fearless now.

[Exit AGIS guarded.

Atone your insolence by prompt obedience,
Or death's your portion. [To an Off ier.

Will quickly end the troubles of the hate.

Like snow along the ihore, their army melts.

Enter Mejenger from the dungeon.

MESSENGER.

The executioners refuse their office:
Sacred they hold the person of a king,
A Spartan king descended from the Gods.

AMPHARES.

Again those fables of the villain priests
Rife up to thwart me. Now, my trusty servant,
Approve thy faith, and win my lasting favour.
Each instant of delay is big with peril
Whilst AGIS lives Let thy good sword fulfil
The sentence of the law, and thy own tongue
Shall name the recompense.

MESSENGER.
Shall it, my lord ?

I am your initrument, and bind myself
By this bold deed still falser to your fortunes. [Exit.

AMPHARES.

Ye sons of bold ambition, learn of me:
Trust not the survey of another's eye:
Your dangerous voyage needs a pilot's care
Who never quits the helm.

Enter SPARTAN.

SPARTAN.

We are betray'd.
LYSANDER-

AMPHARES.
What of him Speak -faulter not.

SPARTAN.
Is fled.

Whither ? With whom ?-Eternal Godst

SPARTAN.

The guards have set him free, the open gates
I saw, and ent'ring fearch'd the empty tower.

AMPHARES.

That trator Euxos !-Now let me resolve
And quickly to.

SPARTAN.

The people are alarm'd,
And gather to-their tribes.

AMPHARES.

Curst be their tribes.

The deed is done already. Yet I have
One pledge of value.

SPARTAN.

AGESISTRATA.

AMPHARES.

This hour (he dies. I've sent a trulty slave
To end her woes. But the Athenian maid,
Her I'll bear off in spite of frowning fortune.
Go to the turret, and conduft her hither. [Exit Spartan.

.laind AMPHARES.

Malignant powers! .or blind unerring Fate,
This is your work: now you assert your empire.

Enter MESSENGER.

My lord, the troops of Euxus have revolted.
RHINALCES visited this night each poll,
And near Amycla's gate some Thracians met,
Whose leader, queflion'd, anfwer'd with his sword,

AMPHARES.
Byheaven and earth, LYSAAD-ER !-Ha! proceed.

MESSENGER.

The sudden onset, and the cloud of night
The traitors favour'd; some efcap'd our swords,
But many more in the (harp combat fell.

AMPHARES.

AMPHARES.
Did their fierce leader fall ?

MESSENGER.

Above the reft

Conspicuous he fought; at him each sword
Was pointed. If he'fell not on the spot,
Sure he received wounds that must fatal prove.

AMPHARES.

Confirm me that, and I will mock at fate.
Command my troops, that in the Forum watch,
To join RHINALCES. I myfclf will follow.

Enter EUANTHE.

How beautiful the is ! Should he survive,
Those charms divine he never Ihall enjoy.

EUANTHE.

Why haft thou call'd me hither to afflit
And torture me with fpeftacles of woe ?

The Gate of the Prifin opens, and

AMPHARES'S Slave advances.

Eternal powers! Why yawn yon dreadful gates?
And from what horrid deed stalks yonder villain ?

MESSENGER.
Thy orders are obey'd. He lives no more.

EUANTHE.

Barbarian monfler ! haft thou kill'd LYSANDER ?-
But I will not reproach thee, nor complain
To the regardless Gods. My doom is past;
There is one only refuge for EUANTHE.
Once more I follow where LYSANDER leads,
Where murder and AMPHARES cannot come,
To part us more.

She runs towards th dunge on,

AMPHARES feiZS her.

AMPHARES.

Some other season choose.

There is no leisure now for lamentation.
Forthwith conduEt her to th' Arcadian gate:
There with the horsemen wait.

Enter MESSENGER.

MESSENGER.

My Lord, my Lord,
The royal band by Thracian Euxus led-

(Shout.)

AMPHARES.

Mly enemy prevails.-This way with me.
MIy feps pursue, or by the Gods of Hell !-

EUASTHE.

I will nor leave this place. Draw forth thy sword,
And try if death can terrify despair.

AMPHARES.
Drag her along. (Sbsut.)

Again !-the foe draws near.

The dungeon-mouth is open. Enter RHESUS.

Tell me, RHEStJS.

RHesus.
The king is murder'd, in yon vault he lies.

LYSANDER.

MIy prince! my friend ! thy goodniefs, and thy virtue,
Thy clemency, thy .mildness, have undone thee!
Fatal to natioiis is the dread example !
Hence monarchs, who with iron sceptre rule,
Will justify their treatment of mankind';
And virtuous princes, born in evil times,
Will hesitate to Item corruption's tide,
Left they should be like Ac is overwhelm'd

AMPHARES.

He who preferr' LYSANDER to AMPHARES,
Has paid me with his life. My dying hand
Hath sow'd the feeds of discord and diftraftion.
Peace ne'er fliall dwell in Sparta. Plagues on plagues
Shall rife to cuife you, as-- (Dies.)

LYSANDER.

Thy foul is curli.

There the fell fpii-it of AMPHARES fled
In imprecations. Prophet of difaftersi
Upon the dismal banks of Acheron,
Amidst the wailing ghosts, still curse thy country,
And end a fpcech the damn'd will hate to hear.-
Behold the mother of our murder'd king.

Enter AGE'SSTRA TA ald Euxus.

AGESISTRATA.

Alas ! I need not as; the fate of A GIS:
Your looks, your lilence fay, I have no son !
Yet speak to me, for I can hear the worst,
I have been long familiar with affliction;
I am the widow of the fire of AGIS.

F 2 LY-

LYSANDER.

There lies the bloody author of his death
Slain by my hand.

AGESISTRATA.
Alas ! alas! my son

Oft has my anxious mind this hour foreseen,
And warn'd thee oft. But thou the danger fcorn'd,
When Sp-rtz's glory was the price of peril.
O ! son cf Jove. great author of our race,
Suftiin my fiul. For he who was my flay,
My comfort, and my strength, is now no more.
Yet in the path his generous spirit chafe,
He fell; and conscious r ituc crown'd his fall.

LYSANDER.
So fell not false AMPHARES.

Euxus.

And SANDANE.

LYS.A DER.
SASDANE dead

Euxus.

And dreadful was her death.

She fled, for refuge from the people's rage,
To the fame turret where AMPHARES' troops
Guarded the queen, whose mantle on the ground
She spied, and wrapt it round her wretched head;
When suddenly a stern assassin came,
And stabb'd her, as that queen whose robe she wore.
Arriving then, I heard her Ihriek for help,
Implore her country's Gods, with bitter cries,
And, in her agony divulge her crimes.
It was no wonder that fle sear'd to die.

AGESISTRATA.

0 gilt ! thou'rt worst of all; he knew thee not,
For whom I mourn. Untimely was his fate;
Yet tll1 of high and pleafiDg thoughts he fell.

Great-

Great-hearted Virtue, in its swelling honr,
Scarce feels 'the blow that strikes at brittle life.
The painful part is mine, in grief to live.
Would I had dy'd for thee, my son ! my Ton

EUANTHE.

EUANTHE'S tears Ihall ever flow with yours,
For her protedor and her gentle friend.
Mysterious are the counsels of the Gods;
Together AGIS and AMPHARES fall.

LYSANDER.

The son of AGIS lives, his infant years
Require a mother's care. Without delay
Proclaim the son of AGIs king of Sparta.
To him, the offspring of my prince ador'd,
Descend the love and faith I bore to AGIS.
Ye generous Thrac;ans, who this day have fliewn
The matchless worth and honour of your minds,
Henceforth be Spartans. And, ye Spartan youths
Whom AGIs lov'd, and for whose rights he died,
Display the spirit of your dear-bought freedom;
With grateful valour guard the hero's son,
And prove that AGIS perilh'd not in vain.

AGESISTRATA.
Condu&t me, Spartans, to his dear remains.

LYSANDER.
Forbear awhile von dismal vault.-Enter MESSENGER.

MESSENGER.

My Lord,

The people, headed by the pricfts of Jove
And Hercules, in long proceflion come,
Bearing the body of their royal lord,
From that base dungeon to the fculptur'd tomb
Which guards the iacred dust of Sparta's kings.

Enter the Procefitcn with

ihe Body of AGIS.

Nature is thwarted here; thou ihouldfthave borne
Thy aged parent to the silent tomb.

Mourn, ye sons of Sparta, mourn,
Pour the fad lamenting firain.
Wretched people! Land forlorn !
Iourn the best of princes (lain.

Priefi of JUPITER.

He fell not as the warrior falls,
Whose breast defends his native walls.
To treason Agis bow'd his head,
And by his guilty fubiects bled:
Betrav'd by thofc his mercy fpr'd;
Ingratitude was his reward.

CHOR US.

Shame is minx'd with Sparta's woe,
Blood of kings the city fiains.
Ever let our sorrows flow,
Shame indelible remains.

Priest of JUPITER.

Yet AGIS triumph'd in his fall;
For Virtue triumphs over all:
Great, fuper;or to his fate,
He only griev'd for Sparta's Iate.
When Jove decrees a nation's doom,
He calb their heroes to the tomb.
Fearless they fall, immortal rife,
And claim the freedom of the ikies.

CH ORU

CHORUS.

AG s triumph'd in his fall,
Virtue triumphs over all
Such a king shall ne'er return:
Our country and ourselves we mourn.

Priest of HERCULES.

AGIS fell, by fraud o'ercome;
Alike was great Alcides' doom.
Yet then molt worthy of his fire,
The son of Jove, when wrapt in fire,
VifCorious crown'd his labours past:
His noblest labour was the last.

CHoRUS of all.

Now in peace our hero lies,
Ceas'd his toil, his race is run;
Freedom is the glorious prize
Agis for his people won.
