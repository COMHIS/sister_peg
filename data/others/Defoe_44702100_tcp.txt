and easier to be struggled with, in
any Incident which might happen,
than those which might proceed from
a standing Force of Mercenaries, to
be kept up in Time of Peace; by
which very thing this Kingdom had
more than once been in great Dan-ger
of having her Liberty over-whelmed,
and the worst of Slavery
entailed upon her; and that there-fore
the War being over, the Nation
ought to take effectual Care of their
own Liberties; and to limit the
Number of the Forces to such, and no
more, as might be thought sufficient
for the publick Safety.
            It was not altogether so agreeable to
His Majesty's Thoughts at that Time,
as could have been wish'd; and e-specially
the Regiment of Dutch
Guards were exceedingly desired by
the King; but it could not be: The
Members declar'd, That it was not
from a Jealousy or Disrespect for the
Person of His Majesty, who, they
were throughly satisfied, would nei-ther
himself, or by his Permission,
ever suffer an Army to oppress them;

Liberty to bring to open View, the
Steps which have been taken by his
Enemies, not only towards the Ruin
of their Country; but also towards
vindicating themselves, by laying their
own Crimes at his Door; in which
Defence, no question, not only all
these things will be placed in a fuller
and clearer Light; but many other
things be brought into View, which
have hitherto been either concealed,
or very ill understood.

but that the Precedent would be
dangerous to Posterity, when the
Successors of His Majesty might,
perhaps, make a fatal Use of that
Advantage, of which he would make
no Advantage at all.
            It was reported at that Time,
that Mr. Harley was chosen against
the Measures of the Court; and that
the King was disobliged by him to
the last Degree, on Account of the
aforesaid breaking of the Forces. But
His Majesty himself removed the
Scandal of that Rumour, by assuring
Mr. Harley, that he was very well
satisfy'd with him; and indeed the
Principles upon which the English
Gentlemen went at that Time, were
so evidently essential to the preserving
their Liberties, that the King himself,
who was a great Patron of Liberty,
was perfectly satisfy'd with the thing
afterwards; and likewise with the
Persons, expressing a very particular
Esteem for Mr. Harley to the Time
of his Death, which happened soon
after.
            
               

At the Accession of the Queen to
the Crown, Her Majesty was pleas-ed
to chuse Her Ministry among a
Sett of Men, who, there was some
Reason to have expected other Con-duct
from them to Her Majesty, at
least the Queen expected it; but
they who knew them better, were
not so much disappointed in them as
Her Majesty was.
            It imports not to record their Fail-ings
farther than thus; to let Poste-rity
know, they began to precipitate
the Crown, in many Cases, to a Degree
that must, in Time, have been fatal.
            In all these Cases Mr. Harley sig-nalized
himself, by that famous Stand
which he made in Behalf of the Li-berties
of his Country; of which
those who shared in the Advantage
cannot entirely forget the Particu-lars.
Those who were nearest the
Queen, and most faithful to Her In-terest,
finding the Influence he had
in the House, was of use to them on
many Accounts, began, about this

Time, to see he was a Person neces-sary
to keep a closer Correspondence
with; and having found the Queen
of the same Opinion, he was receiv-ed
into the Cabinet Measures, and
the nicest Affairs communicated to
him.
            In this Station he obtain'd, upon
the Opinion not only of the Persons
who he necessarily was embark'd
with; as the late E. of Godolphin, the
Duke of M—and some others;
but of the Queen more especially,
who, with my L. Godolphin, had a
singular Esteem for him.
            It was easy for Mr. Harley, in this
Scituation, to convince Her Majesty,
of the absolute Necessity She was in,
of changing Her Measures, and of
dismissing a furious Faction, who
began to be odious to the People, by
their pushing the Government upon
such things as tended to embroil Her
Majesty with Her best Subjects; and
make the War abroad, which was
then newly entred into, be either
impracticable, or unsuccessful, by

reason of the Discontents at Home,
which were rising to a great Height
among the People, and sometimes
between the Two Houses of Parlia-ment
themselves.
            In the Pursuit of this Council, the
Advantage whereof the whole King-dom
feels to this Day, the Queen was
pleased to dismiss Sir Edward Sey-mour's
Party, so they were call'd, and
fill up the Houshold with such a Mi-nistry,
as the present Age pretends to
be very well satisfy'd in; the prime
Ministry, as it is call'd, resting in
the late Lord Treasurer Godolphin;
the Army, in the D. of M—h; and
Mr. Harley was made Secretary of
State, in the Room of the E. of
N—m; Sir Charles Hedges
keeping the Seals as the other Secre-tary
of State, as he was before.
            Thus the Introduction of that
Ministry was the Work of Mr. Har-ley;
and it was to his Counsels that
they ow'd their being established in
the full Administration of Affairs;
which, whilst they carry'd on with
Unanimity of Councils, and without

Jealousy of one another, were admi-nistred
with great Satisfaction to Her
Majesty, and all Her People at
Home, as well as with glorious Suc-cesses
abroad; during this Time,
the Animosities among the good
People began exceedingly to abate;
the Remembrances of Occasional Bills,
Tackings, &amp;c. wore much off of the
Minds of the People, and the Court
generally discouraging the Breaches
among the Queen's Subjects; an open
and free Administration was carry'd
on, by which Room was left for all
Her Majesty's Subjects, of whatever
Party, to restore themselves to Her
Favour, by their Merit; and to wipe
out the Remembrances of any Miscar-riages,
by a future dutiful Behaviour.
A Method of Government exceedingly
agreeable to the Queen, as it would,
had it gone on, have been, in Time,
healing to the Nation.
            But this happy Scheme was not a-like
pleasing to all; and some, who
had Cravings in Nature to satisfy,
which were not so consistent with
this disinterested Manner of Manage-ment,

began to be uneasy at the
Apprehensions of letting in the Mob,
as it was call'd, into their Affairs.
The Interest in Her Majesty, which,
as it was call'd, was not a thing of
so little Value to be laid open, and
Her Favour and Confidence to be
made Common to the People:
They found that as they had made
it a Property, so their Success gave
them an Advantage above all that
went before them, by seeming to
make themselves necessary to Her
Majesty: This Point was carried
on to such an Extremity, the Sweet-ness
of governing, even their Sove-reign,
alluring, that finding Mr.
Harley inflexible; and that he would
not join in such narrow Measures;
but desir'd, that the Queen might
Reign for Her self, and all Her Sub-jects
have Access to Her; that She
might be fully apprized of all Her
Affairs; and act as well by Know-ledge
as Advice: Finding this was
the Scheme he had laid; and
that it was directly opposite to their
own, and would, in the End, over-throw
it: They from that Time

entred into Measures either to sup-plant
him in Her Majesty's Favour,
or in his Employment.
            The first, notwithstanding many
Misrepresentations and mean Steps
taken, they could not effect; the last,
they brought to pass for a Season.
            It seems that they brought the last
to pass with Difficulty; and it was
evident to them, as also to others,
that as her Majesty parted not with
Mr. Harley without great Reluctance;
so that altho' he was dismiss'd from
the Office of her principal Secretary,
that yet he had access to her Person,
and had opportunity to communicate
such Councils as occasion offer'd, ha-ving
the Honour, from that time, of a
Confidence with his Sovereign, which
those, who had Power to displace him,
had then no Share in.
            This Favour of his Prince was
much encreased by some foul things
which had been discover'd to her Ma-jesty
to have been practised upon him,
in order to render him suspected to

be concern'd in the Treason of Mr.
Gregg, and more especially by some
Steps which were privately taken by
some Persons, in order, by Fear of
Death, or Hope of Mercy, to induce
the said Gregg, when under Sentence
of Death, to accuse Mr. Harley; and
as her Majesty receiv'd the Account
of those Designs with Tokens of great
Displeasure, and even of Detestation;
so the Declaration which the Crimi-nal
gave, even just before his Executi-on,
of the Innocence of Mr. Harley▪
                as
it was a particular Satisfaction to the
Queen, so it confirm'd the Opinion
her Majesty had conceived of Mr.
Harley, as a Person proper to be en-trusted,
and fit to be employed in her
Service.
            It might have been useful to have
descended to the Particulars of this
Matter, and to the Persons likewise,
but another time may be thought
more proper; this suffices to shew,
that there was at that time a horrid
Conspiracy against the Life of this
noble Lord; how far it has been car-ried
on, or revived since▪ and whe-ther

it be by the same Hands or not,
will likewise appear, the Time being
approaching, when there may be reason
to lay the blackest part of this Trans-action
open to the View of the Sun.
            Mean time, it is worth notice, that
as the Persons concerned would not
have failed to have accepted the E-vidence
of Mr. Gregg against Mr.
Harley, if he had either known any
thing whereof to accuse him, or had
been prevailed with to have forged
any Accusation, in order to have sa-ved
his Life; yet some of them were
not backward to depretiate the dy-ing
Words of the same Man, when it
appeared they tended to clear the
Person, who they desired rather should
have been accused; discovering thereby
such a Partiality as her Majesty was
pleased to take notice of, to be as cri-minal
in its Degree, as the Design
aforesaid against his Life. It's strange,
said she once upon that Occasion, that
they would not have us believe the Man
now he acquits Mr. Harley, when they
would have believed him if he had accu-sed
him; and that they will not believe the

            MEMOIRS
OF SOME
TRANSACTIONS
DURING
The late MINISTRY, &amp;c.
            VVHEN there is such a
general Expectation of
some great Matter to
be made appear against
the Person these Sheets relate to; and
much Pains is taken to calumniate
and misrepresent him to the World;
it may not be amiss to give the
World some true State of his Case,
that none may be impos'd upon thro'
Ignorance, how far soever Malice
may carry some.
            
               

Man's dying Words, when it is evident
they would have laid great Weight upon
them if he had lived; her Majesty was
pleased likewise many times, when
this Affair was, upon any Occasion,
mention'd to her, to express her Con-cern,
that any Methods so unchristian
and unjust should be taken by Persons
so near Her, to destroy an innocent
Person.
            Yet could not this put a Stop to the
Enemies of Mr. Harley, who, it seems,
were restless in their own Scituation,
while they observed his to be so near
her Majesty's Person as would, upon
all Occasions, interrupt the farther
Designs which they had calculated for
their own Advantage, in being single
and uninterrupted in the Administra-tion;
and therefore, tho' they could
not impose upon her Majesty in the
Case above-mention'd of Mr. Gregg,
they left not any Stone unturn'd to
keep the People of their own Party
deceived, and to have it, by Pamphlet-Writings,
and private Emissaries,
suggested throughout the Kingdom,
that Mr. Harley was guilty of Gregg's

Treason, tho' nothing could be pro-ved
that ever justified so much as a
Suspicion. And altho' Gregg himself,
who could never have been convi-cted
but by his own Confession,
had been induced by Mr. Harley to
make that Confession; so that Mr.
Harley seemed that way to have been
the very Instrument of detecting him
more fully, and by consequence of
his Death; a Provocation sufficient to
make any one expect, that if he could
have saved his Life at Mr. Harley's
Expence, he would have made no
Difficulty of the Exchange, and not a
little the Reason of that low Step some
Persons (otherwise Persons of Honour)
took to bring it to pass, which it may
be believed they would not for their
own Sakes have been seen in, if they
had thought it could have failed of
Success.
            But Gregg, tho' a Traytor, would
not be a Murtherer. Whether they
were not so, who endeavoured to make
him so, will be tryed at another Tri-bunal.
            
               

As these things concurr'd to improve
that Interest which Mr. Harley had
in her Majesty's Favour, so it made
way for, and not a little contributed
to the Breaches which followed, and
the Impressions they made in her
Majesty, in Prejudice of those Men
who were concern'd, were such as
were not easily wiped out. Her Ma-jesty,
who was a Princess of exceed-ing
Piety, believing that Men, who
could stoop to such wicked, and even
bloody Methods, to remove a Person
out of the Way of their Administra-tion;
would stick at few things that
could occur, and were ill qualify'd to
bring about the Blessing of Her
Reign, in the Felicity of Her Peo-ple,
which was Her utmost Desire.
            But things were not yet brought
to Maturity, nor the Grievance of
the Administration come to its Height;
and several things were yet to hap-pen,
which should concur with the
Impressions Her Majesty had re-ceived
before, to lessen the Pleasure
She took in the Services of some a-bout

Her; and, consequently, make
Way for their Remove: But as
these do not concern Mr. Harley, they
shall be no otherwise mentioned, than
as they served to introduce the Re-volution
which followed.
            It was in the Year 1708. when
Mr. Harley was dismiss'd from the
Office of Secretary of State; and Mr.
Boyle, now Lord Carleton, succeeded
him in that Place; a modest inoffensive
Gentleman, and concerned neither
one way or other in the Brigues above-mentioned.
And now it was thought
they who had the Administration
would have gone on in their Business
without any Interruption, that they
had none to disturb them, but that he,
who, they pretended, would have
supplanted them, being laid aside, they
were out of Danger; and it may be
said of them, that they were weak
enough to think thus themselves; but
they soon found themselves deceived,
and that the very Persons, who had
push'd them upon the Breach with
Mr. Harley, on pretence of supplanting
them with the Queen, were in a

strong Confederacy or Plot to sup-plant
them with the People, and by
the Consequence thereof with the
Queen; and wanted nothing, but to
remove Mr. Harley from them, to
make way for the Execution of their
Design, as the Person, whose Inter-est
in the Queen, as well as his Capa-city
to disappoint them, they, above
all other, thought to be dangerous to
them.
            It is with the more Reason that it
is said, they thought, by the Conse-quence
of supplanting the Ministry,
they should effectually supplant them
with the Queen; because, having
made the Experiment in the Case of
Mr. Harley, that the Queen might be
prevailed on by their new Method
of treating her Majesty to part with
Ministers, tho' She was not dissatis-fied
with them; they concluded they
might take the same Method, and
bring her Majesty to the Necessity,
so they undutifully called it, of part-ing
with others: And that this is
true in Fact, that this was their
View at that Time, is proved by a

Letter, written by a noble Lord then
in the Ministry, who, when their
Plot broke out, had the Weakness,
or Want of Decency, to write a Let-ter
to the D—of R—into
Scotland, wherein he treats her Ma-jesty
and Ministry both in the Words
following: 'I would not have you be
bullied by the Court-Party; for the
Queen her self cannot support that
Faction long.'
            
            This was strange Language from
a Secretary of State actually in Office,
and eminently discovered, that the
Charge publickly laid against Mr.
Harley, of a Design to supplant the
Ministry, should have been laid on
another Hand, who now publickly
viewed a Design, not only of sup-planting
the Ministry, who he called
a Faction, but of bringing the
Queen into such a Condition as not
to be able to support them.
            It became soon evident, that the
Persons, who this noble Lord called
a Faction, were no other than the late
Earl of Godolphin, and his Grace the

D—of M—. The One at that
Time at the Head of the Army, the
Other of the Treasury, as by their
farther open Declarations in the Ele-ction
of the next Parliament appear-ed,
in which the Juncto to the Whig-Noble-Men,
embarkt in this Design,
were called, openly joined with the
male-contented Party, so the high
Church were then; nay, even with
the Jacobites against the Ministry,
villifying and exposing the said Lord
and Duke, and especially a certain
Dutchess, in a Manner far exceeding
all that unjustifiable Rudeness that
has been made use of since that Time.
            This however obliged her Majesty
to concern her self in the matter,
and to let the Juncto see, that She
was able to support her Servants, and
that She would not be reduced to the
Necessity they boasted of; the Con-sequence
of this was, that they were
effectually disappointed, and after-wards
made no Difficulty to make
their separate Peace with her Maje-sty
and her Ministry. To which
Transaction Fame refers us for an

eminent Original of abandoning Al-lies,
&amp;c. for it was observable, that
when they made their own Peace,
they left all their Confederates to the
Discretion of the Ministry.
            But this Matter had another Ef-fect,
for which Reason it is made a
necessary Part of this Account, (viz.)
that in the interval of this Breach,
much was discovered of the Infirmi-ty,
to say no worse of it, of both
Sides; and while they were villifying
one another, to render their Designs
black in the View of the People, they
really, as it often happens in lesser
Cases, made the Persons on both
Sides look less in the Esteem of the
World than they did before; there
was much Dirt cast on both Sides in
the Quarrel, and it cannot be said,
that it was all wiped off in the Re-conciliation,
nor did the Breach leave
either Side in the same Station of her
Majesty's Esteem as it found them.
            Her Majesty was a strict Observer
at that Time, of every Article of the
Conduct of either Side; and it made

no small Impression on her Mind,
that She found both Sides were to
make a Property of her Authority,
and that She was to be reduced to a
Necessity of acting their Measures,
which Side soever prevailed. From
which just Observation, tho' her Ma-jesty
sound it needful to support the
Ministry then in her Service, against
those who so openly affronted her
Administration as well as her Person,
in opposing them at that Time; yet
from that Time her Majesty enter-tained
Thoughts of a general Change
in her Measures, and resolved to set
her self free as soon as might be from
the unhappy Necessity, which, it
seems, it was so easie to reduce
her to, (viz.) of not being able to sup-port
her own Administration.
            This was perfectly agreeable to the
Scheme formerly proposed by Mr.
Harley to the Lord Godolphin, and often
explain'd to her Majesty before that
Time, (viz.) to restore her Majesty
to an entire Freedom of acting; that
all her Affairs should be explained to,
and laid before her Majesty; that She

should no more wear the Crown
without the Scepter; that the Doors
should be opened to all Her Subjects,
and a free Access to Her Person be
given to all; that Cases of Conse-quence
might not come cover'd with
the Representations of the Ministers;
but every thing be laid fairly before
the Queen, that She might act with
open Eyes, see for Her self, and give
to, not receive Commands from, Her
Ministry. Her Majesty had, with
some Regret, received the former Im-portunities
of some about Her, in the
Case of placing or displacing of Per-sons;
and especially that unpleasant,
uncomely, as well as undutiful Ex-pression
of, I cannot serve Your Ma-jesty,
unless, &amp;c. and began to be tir'd
with some Peoples personal Conduct,
whose Services were otherwise very
acceptable to Her, and their Fidelity
entirely unsuspected.
            There were two other things which
Her Majesty could not avoid taking
a particular Notice of in this Breach;
and the future Conduct of these ve-ry
Persons make it very much to the

The Matter draws towards a Cri-sis;
the Question will soon be trans-ferr'd,
from between Party and Par-ty,
to a Bar of Justice; and the
Blood of an English Nobleman is to
be the Subject of the Pleadings and
Defence.
            The Earl of Oxford seems to resolve
to appear, and to stand in his own
Defence. I advance one thing with-out
Doors in Defence of his Case in
general, before the Particulars come
to be enquired into. If it be just to
say of my Lord Bolingbroke, that he
knows himself to be guilty, why else
did he fly? It will be as reasonable to
say of my Lord of Oxford, he is satis-fied
in his own Innocence, why else
does he stay?
            Besides the Opinion his Lordship
has of his own Innocence, it must
be acknowledg'd, his Lordship pays
the greatest Honour to the British
Nobility that is possible to do, and
perhaps more than was ever done
before; that however the Turns of

present Purpose to mention it here,
viz. (1.) That the said Juncto made
no Scruple, in order to displace the
said Lord and Duke, to bring the
most known prosess'd Jacobites, as
well of the Nobility as of the Com-mons,
as well in Scotland as in Eng-land,
into their Confederacy, and
even to Vote for them in the Election
of the Parliament then chusing, and
many of them were actually elected
by the Interest of the said Whig
Juncto; the Names are easy to be
given. (2.) That they made no Dif-ficulty
of displacing the D. of M—h
from the Command of the Army;
and thought there would be no Dan-ger
to the Confederacy in it at all;
and Her Majesty was inform'd, that
they went so far as to sound the
Dutch, either to see how they would
approve of a Change, or to prepare
them not to be surpriz'd at it: The
like things having been censured in
such rude Terms by the same Per-sons,
who then, for their own private
Ends, engag'd in them; Her Maje-sty
could not but call to mind the
Circumstances, and look on the Per-sons

with some Resentment, when
they came to speak of the same things
as trayterous, ungrateful, perfidious,
and the like.
            These, and such as these, were the
things which pav'd the Way for the
new Turn, which soon after happen-ed;
in which Mr. Harley acted con-sonant
to what he had from the first
propos'd; laying before Her Majesty
such Measures as were calculated for
quieting, not disturbing the Admini-stration;
not proposing such Change
of Parties, and such Turnings out of
Persons, as afterwards happened;
no such thing being in View, till the
Combinations of certain Persons in
Places, and who acted upon the old
Principle of reducing the Queen to
the Necessity of acting as they de-sired,
oblig'd Her Majesty to do it.
            It is not needful to enter into the
Detail of the Conduct of others;
but this Passage cannot be omitted,
viz. that the Evening of that Day,
when the Treasurer, the Earl of Go-dolphin,
was displaced, a general Meet-ing

of the Persons in that Interest,
was held at Mr. B—House,
where it was laid down as a Maxim,
that the new Managers could no
Way support the Undertaking; that
they could never be able to keep up
the publick Credit, raise Money, or
carry on the War; but would soon
plunge the Queen in such inextricable
Difficulties, as that She would be
forc'd to come back to them; and
therefore it was their Business, one
and all, to resolve not to come into
the Queen's Measures, in order to di-stress
Her new Ministers, and so ob-lige
Her to dismiss them.
            How openly they pursued this
Resolution, is well known; as also
how Mr. Harley, now made Chan-cellor
of the Exchequer, and one of
the Commissioners of the Treasury,
surmounted all the Difficulties which
they cast in the Way, supply'd the
Money, kept up the Credit, and run
into no Plunges, as was suggested,
by which they were no less surprized
than disappointed; all this is recent
and known.
            
               

It is named here, to shew where
began the Mischief of the Change;
this Meeting of the late Managers
was neither more or less than form-ing
themselves into a Faction against
the Queen, and Her new Measures;
which, though it did not produce
the Necessity upon the Queen of
changing Her Ministry again, as they
expected; yet it did put the new
Managers upon making use of other
Hands than they intended; to which
Point of Circumstance, all that has
since happened, may be traced back,
as to its proper and only Original;
for had that Faction not been form-ed,
or had they not, when formed,
absolutely rejected the Queen's Offers
of Accommodation, and of keeping
them in their Places, nothing is more
true, than that all things had gone
on in the usual Course of the Admi-nistration,
by the same Methods, to
the same Purpose, and almost by the
same Persons as before. But Sathan
hindered; and the Conduct of the
outed Party was very singular on
that Occasion.
            
               

It occurr'd to them naturally, that
the Parliament in being would take
some Step in their Favour; and that
they should be able to spread the
Uneasiness much farther, if not
throughout the Kingdom, and it of-fered
as a Foundation of forming a
new Interest in their Favour; this
pass'd a while, and their Friends in
the City falling upon the new Mini-stry
with some Attempts of another
Nature, it was evident, they sup-ported
those Attempts, by their De-pendance
on their Interest in the
Parliament; and so open they were
in their Politicks on this Occasion,
that they were not backward to say,
The Parliament would unravel the
new Measures, and the Queen could
go on no farther than the next Ses-sion.
The Ministry were too vigi-lant
not to see the Design; nor was
Mr. Harley ignorant how far they
might probably go to make good
their Threats: This made it abso-lutely
necessary to dissolve the Parlia-ment;
the Inclination of the People
also to the Change, now beginning

to appear more than it had done be-fore;
and the new Elections appear-ing
to be generally on the Side of
the Change, the Resolutions of the
Party mention'd above, began to
waver, their Interest separate, and,
in fine, the new Ministry, after this,
met with less Difficulty and Obstru-ction
in their Affairs, though not
with less ill Treatment from particu-lar
Persons, and from the Party in
the City especially, where the Fer-ment
went too high to be spoken
of in a narrow Compass, and where
the Measures taken to ruin the Pub-lick
Credit were such, though unsuc-cessful,
as has not been ever pra-ctis'd
before, and gave Her Majesty
great Cause to resent them, even on
the whole Party.
            In this Juncture, Mr. Harley was
snatch'd from the Administration, by
an unparallell'd Attempt upon his
Life; at first it surpriz'd every one,
as it began to be thought the Attempt
of the aforesaid Party, or some set on
Work by them; but it soon appear'd
the single Act of an enrag'd French-man,
               

the Marquiss de Guiscard, made
desperate by being detected of a
Treasonable Correspondence with
France, who assassinated Mr. Harley
at the Council Table, stabbing him
into the Breast with a Penknife, and
repeating the Blow a second Time,
not knowing that the Penknife was
broke, and the Blade left in the
Wound; he gave him a Contusion
with the Handle by the next Blow,
more dangerous and painful than the
first: What mov'd this Scelerat to such
an horrid Act, the apprehending him,
wounding him, his Imprisonment, and
Death in the Prison of Newgate, are
needless in this Account; being also
made publick at that Time by other
Writers.
            None could be blamed for being of
the Opinion, till the Particulars ap-pear'd,
that this Blow was given by
the Procurement of the other Party;
because it suited so exactly with the
Language given publickly the Person
of Mr. Harley at that Time, as well in
the City as elsewhere, that it was
confess'd by themselves, the Suspicion

was just: But the Horror of the Fact
so touch'd those, who had a Sense of
Humanity, that the Generality, even
of the Enemies of the new Ministry,
could not refrain expressing them-selves
with some Warmth against it,
and it assisted for some time to the
treating him with something less In-decency
than before; and not only
so, but the Affairs of the Govern-ment
gaining upon the Opposers eve-ry
Day, the new Measures began to
be better relish'd among the People
than before.
            Soon after the Recovery of Mr.
Harley, and his Conduct in the pub-lick
Affairs having satisfy'd Her Ma-jesty,
that his Qualifications for the
Employment were equal to the
Weight of such an Employ, the Com-mission
for the Treasury was dissolv-ed,
and Mr. Harley was made Lord
High Treasurer of Great Britain; Her
Majesty doing him the Honour to
give Him the Staff with Her own
Hand, and at the same Time to
sign a Patent, creating him Earl of
Oxford and Earl Mortimer, and soon

after created him also Knight of the
Garter.
            
            These things are needful to men-tion,
because they are the Sum of
all the Advantages which he can be
said to share out for himself, having
not, his Enemies being Judges, accu-mulated
Honour or Profits, as has
been usual by Persons in great Posts;
and this may be said without Boast-ing,
that no personal Avarice, no ag-grandizing
of his Family, no getting
of Grants, either to himself or to
his Family, has been, or with Ju-stice
can be charged on him; though,
by the Share he enjoy'd of His Roy-al
Mistress's Favour, it might be sup-pos'd,
that he could not want Op-portunity
for many things, which
might have been as profitable as the
most craving Temper might be satis-fy'd
with.
            The new Parliament being met,
the Lower House appeared enclin'd
dutifully to oblige Her Majesty, in e-very
thing consistent with their Li-berties,
and with the publick Good;

and the Queen never desiring any
thing of them which shock'd their
Affections to their Country's Safety
and Advantage: This mutual Re-ctitude
of Principle, created a perfect
Harmony between Her Majesty and
the House; every thing offered by
the House to Her Majesty, met with
a gracious Reception and ready
Grant; and every thing laid before
them by the Queen, was so just and
so clear, that the House, with an
entire Confidence, came into Her
Majesty's Measures cheerfully, and
with the greatest Alacrity imagi-nable.
            This
Harmony was a great Dis-appointment
to the Party, who op-posed
the Ministry, and was chiefly
owing to the exact Adhering to
such Measures in the Administration,
as could admit no substantial Ob-jection;
for it could not be said,
that the other People were not vi-gilant,
to take Hold of every thing
that might have given them any
just Advantage. The Treasurer, as
far as he directed any thing, took

the Government since his Admini-stration,
may have given Impressions
of things very different from what
were in his Time; and as it might
be suggested, very much to his Dis-advantage;
nay, however Interest
may seeem to run, even in a very
strong Stream against him; yet that
he pays such a profound Respect to
the unspotted Honour of the Peer-age,
as to cast his Life into their
Hands, at a Time when Thoughts
less generous might be apt to en-tertain
some Fears of the Impressions,
which Party might have made on
the Minds of the Nobility, at a
Time when it is scarce to be said,
that any other Sett of Men in the
Nation are entirely free.
            Either my L. O—must have
some surprizing Evidence in himself
of his own Innocence; and not only
so, but of his being able to set that
Innocence in a clear Light to the
World; or else he makes the great-est
Compliment to the Nobility of
Britain that ever Man made. He
supposes their Lordships untainted

Care to keep it within the ordinary
Rules of Business; and, particularly,
knowing what Men he had to do
with, took Care to have every thing
transacted in full Council, and to be
duly minuted in the Books. He kept
to the Principle first laid down, of
having the Queen see with Her own
Eyes; and after duly debating things
in Her Presence, to have every thing
directed by Her Majesty, with Con-sent,
of Her own Knowledge, that
Her Majesty might have no Occasion
to say, as had been too much the
Case formerly, that She left things
to such and such Persons, and had
been ill serv'd.
            The Treasurer likewise took especial
Care to have all Business transacted
in the proper Offices, and sign'd by
the Hands whose Province it was;
thereby restoring the Administration
to its natural Course, and delivering
the Government from the Grievance
of a PRIME MINISTER;
and this is evident now, even to the
Surprize of his Enemies, who hav-ing
suppos'd, that the Treasurer trans-acted

every thing, as had been the
general Belief; and for which all a-long
the Party loaded him with in-finite
Aspersions, find now that he
really managed nothing separately;
and rather employ'd himself to pre-serve
the Oeconomy of the Admini-stration,
and see the publick Business
distributed into the proper Hands,
and then leaving those Hands to dis-charge
their Duty, than interposing
his own Authority, or encroach-ing
upon the Province of the Mini-sters.
            Perhaps
this Truth is so new, and
the contrary has been so generally
received, that it will not immediate-ly
meet with that Credit, that ought
to be expected to a thing so mani-fest;
but when it shall appear, that,
in unravelling the Administration of
those Times, nothing can be found
transacted by him, but what was the
particular Duty of his Office, as Trea-surer;
and that, on the contrary, e-very
Minister of State did the Duty
of his Place, and acted to the full
what was his particular Province to

act; and that consequently, they can-not
fasten such things upon the Trea-surer
as it was hoped he might be
charged with. I say, if this should
not be the Case, it will be a full
Confirmation of what is said here,
that he rather directed every Man to
his Duty, than acted in their Province
himself. It was his Complaint, during
the Administration of others, that
they engrossed the Business into their
Hands; that the Secretaries and Privy
Council were but Agents, and were
made use of for Form only; and
that the Queen being surrounded by
them, all Access to her Person was
cut off; and it was his profess'd Inten-tion,
that it should be otherwise in
his Administration; and if this is not
made sufficiently evident to those who
are now so narrowly inspecting his
Conduct, by the Manner in which
they will find all Business transacted,
there is another Proof which will oc-cur
to every Understanding, (viz.)
the Power the other Ministers of
State, and Men of Intreigue, obtain-ed
hereby with the Queen; by which
they afterwards took upon them to

oppose his Councils, and at last ef-fectually
supplanted him.
            If it had been true, that every
thing had been done by him, as it
was unjustly said by his Enemies, it
could not have been true, that his Ma-nagement
was ill approved of by the
Queen, and other Men entrusted, di-stinct
from him, and who, when he
opposed them; appeared to have a
greater Interest in her Majesty than
he had, till at length they obliged
him either to come into their Mea-sures,
which, in regard to the Good
of his Country, he could not comply
with, or to withdraw from them, and
quit the Administration, which he ve-ry
happily for himself chose to do.
            In this Conduct consists so much
his present Safety, that we see some
of his Enemies very much disappoint-ed,
in that they cannot find him in
several Parts of the Management of
things which they thought were all
his own; and it is surprising to find
how far this Opinion of his, being the
Fac Totum in all the Administration,

had prevailed; and the Enemies of the
Treasurer are under some Confusion,
by their not finding all Business dire-cted
by him. It is manifest, that they
had entertained a Notion, that the
Queen was wholly governed by him;
that She did nothing her self, and no-thing
but by his Direction; which is
so evidently untrue, that it appears
her Majesty not only acted without
him, but even contrary to him, in
many things, till at last She was plea-sed
to enter wholly into the Measures
of other Men; and when he could
not be prevailed upon to join in those
Measures, thought fit to act quite
without him▪ This, however unex-pected,
will shew, that what has of-ten
been said to the Queen her self, is
now confirmed, (viz.) that the Trea-surer
bore the Load of many things
which he had no concern in; and in-deed
this was evidently one Reason
why he drew out of the Administrati-on,
of which, and of whose Mistakes,
tho' he did not approve, he was sure
to bear the Scandal.
            
               

It is not to the Purpose to enter
here into the Reasons why the Trea-surer
rejected the Measures proposed
to him by these new Men; whether
they were consistent with the publick
Good, or the Queen's Safety and Ho-nour,
is fitter for them to defend, than
for him to enquire into; it suffices to
say, they were such as the Treasurer
thought were not for her Majesty's
Service, and that therefore he declin-ed
the public Affairs, rather than go
on upon those Foundations. It is effe-ctually
proved by the Circumstance
of his Dismiss also, that the Admini-stration
consisted of several Parts, and
was not engrossed, as was suggested,
by the Treasurer, in an arbitrary man-ner.
The Discontents of other Men
having been carried to such a Length,
as to affront him even in the Execu-tion
of his Office, and to reject all the
Offers of an Accommodation or Re-conciliation,
which the Treasurer fre-quently
made to them, that the pub-lic
Business might not be hindred. It
is likewise to be observed, that in these
Offers of Reconciliation, the Treasu-rer

always represented the absolute
Necessity there was of having every
Office do its own Business, and the
Administration to run in the due
Course, according to the ordinary
Administration, without any suggest-ing
the Superintendency of a prime
Minister, or so much as claiming any
Reserve to himself; being willing to
confine himself to the Sphere of his
Office, with more Strictness than any
of them desired.
            It was not the least Affliction to
the Treasurer, that he found the A-varice
of some Men in Office, and the
Ambition of others, to be made great
sooner than ordinary, began early to
offer Obstructions to the public Busi-ness,
and that he was frequently ill
used by those, who, he thought, had
Reason to treat him otherwise, parti-cularly
by a certain Esq that he was
not made a Peer so soon as he was
willing to be so; as also that when
he was honoured with the Peerage,
it was but a Viscount; and yet more,
that when some Garters were dispo-sed,
he was not gratified: This was

the more afflicting, because that
when this Person was at first, by the
Treasurer's Interest, recommended
to her Majesty, for the Office which
he was entrusted with, the Treasu-rer
believed he would have acted
from Principles of Zeal for her Ma-jesty's
Service, and a generous Con-cern
for the Church and Nation in
all he did, without making his private
Advancement the Sum of his Desires,
and pushing that Particular so far, as
to insult his Friends for the Delay,
however necessary that Delay would
be to the Queen's Service, who found
it necessary to make use of his Ser-vice
longer in the House of Commons,
and gave him Assurances, at the same
time, that the Delay should be no
Detriment to his Rank; so that it
only affected his Impatience, not his
Ambition, which was an exceeding
Aggravation of his Mistake, shewing
at what rate he esteemed his Mi-stress's
Service, and the Public Good,
which, to a Minister of State, should
always go before his own Advance-ment.
            
               

The Treasurer failed not, upon all
Occasions, to represent to this Person,
and to his Friends, the evil Conse-quences
of dividing from the Queen's
Service, by dividing against one ano-ther;
but was always treated with
Disrespect, and with much Passion.
The necessary Concerts in publick
Matters were much hindred by these
things, and it was scarce possible to
go on in the Execution of Matters
determined in the Council to be done,
all Confidence being hereby destroy-ed,
and the Harmony, necessary in
carrying on so much Business, where
so much Opposition was to be expe-cted,
being thus broken, it is not to
be wondred at, if it gave infinite Ad-vantages
to those who made that Op-position,
of which the Treasurer fail-ed
not in making just Representations,
as well to the Persons themselves, as
to her Majesty likewise, who often
spoke of the same with Regret.
            But it was all to no Purpose, the
Treasurer found the Heat encrease,
rather than abate; and that it par-ticularly

bent its Fury at such things
which, altho' they were particular to
the Province of Treasurer, he had
thought fit to do without communi-cating
his Schemes to him, tho' at
the same time they thought fit to
carry on the Negotiations and Trea-ties
abroad, in many Cases, without
communicating their Measures to him,
and sometimes hardly to the Queen
herself. The Treasurer has been loth
to mention the mean Reasons given for
their quarrelling with him about the
Scheme for Payment of the great
Debt the Nation was engaged in,
(viz.) that they should have gotten
Money by it; but since the secret
Committee have thought fit to pub-lish
that Part of it, which the Trea-surer
formerly laid before her Maje-sty,
whereby it is no longer a Secret,
it may serve to convince Mankind,
that the disinterested Conduct of the
Treasurer in the Administration, and
his resolving to make no private Gain
out of the Ruins of his Country,
was not the least Part of his Manage-ment,
which those Men disliked, or

with the Prejudice of the Times; and
that nothing can byafs their Minds,
nothing artfully prepossess their Judg-ments;
that they cannot be blind-ed
by any humane Infirmities, mov-ed
by any Passions, imposed upon
by the Perswasions, or affected by
private Views of any kind; that
they cannot be hurry'd by popular
Winds or Storms, from whatever
Corner they may blow, whether of
Faction, Tumult, Envy, or Ambi-tion:
But that they will move in a
direct Path of Justice, guided by
Truth, without the least Deviation
or Inclination one Way or other, ei-ther
from Parties, Persons, Interest,
or Power, of any kind whatsoever.
            Besides this, his Lordship seems to
pay a most dutiful and honourable
Regard to the personal Justice, Cle-mency,
and Honour of His Majesty;
declaring, by thus putting himself on
his Trial, at such a Juncture as this,
that he firmly depends upon His
Majesty's Royal Virtue; that nothing
will, on the King's Part, be offered
or encouraged to byass, or lead to

the least Reason why they behaved so
uneasily to him.
            But to dwell no longer on this
Part, those who knew the Difficulties
with which the Treasurer struggled,
in the Matters of Credit, and of Mo-ney,
and the Opposition the Party,
whom the Queen had dismiss'd, made
to every Step that was taken to re-store
it, could not but wonder that
these Men, who, at the same Time
confess themselves unequal to the
Work, should not be content to con-tribute
no Assistance to it, but should,
on the contrary, so much obstruct
things, and encourage the Opposition
of others, as their Breaches one with
another were known to do.
            The Treasurer had baffled the De-signs
of those who had endeavoured
to prevent his remitting Money to
the Army, and the establishing the
Credit of the Publick; and notwith-standing
at his Entrance into the
Office, he found the Exchequer ex-hausted,
the Bank refusing to advance
Money upon such Securities as the

Government was able to offer, had
the Army at the same time in the
Field, which some People were not
ashamed to own, they expected should
mutiny for their Pay, yet he had ma-stered
all these Difficulties, and gave
good Reason to believe that he would
have gone thro' every other Obstru-ction;
and it was not a little afflicting
to him, to find his Opposers among
those who he had, by his Interest
and Recommendation, brought into
Business.
            Yet as things are now like to go,
it is no little Satisfaction to him, that
if there has been any criminal Nego-tiations
set on Foot, any favouring the
Pretender, any Measures entred into,
to the Prejudice of the Succession of
the House of Hanover, these things
must be found among those Parts of
their Conduct which they were plea-sed
to transact by themselves, and to
which they did not vouchsafe to ad-mit
the Treasurer, as not being so
much at that Time in their Confi-dence;
and as they acted these things
by themselves, so they must answer

for them by themselves, if the present
Government think fit to call them to
Account for it, the Treasurer having
had no Concern in any thing of that
Nature, and is persuaded that no Man
had the Assurance to make an Offer
of any thing of that kind to her Ma-jesty,
and that if they had, that the
Queen would have resented it with the
utmost Indignation.
            The Obstruction these things gave
to the publick Administration, had
divers other Effects; and particularly
it gave Encouragement to the outed
Party, in their vigorous Opposition of
all her Majesty's Measures, which
they carried up to such a height, as to
expect the House of Peers would be
brought to their Side; and tho' the
Treasurer had a firm Satisfaction in
the Peers, that they would not be
imposed upon in these things, yet see-ing
the Numbers appear'd something
equal, and that the Party discovered
some Assurance of carrying their
Point; Her Majesty resolving not to
run the Venture, chose to make a
Number of Lords for ballancing his

Enemies, a Practice allowed by the
Law, and undoubtedly in the Prero-gative,
however clamoured very
much in the present Case; and not-withstanding
which, as was evident
by the Sequel, the Treasurer's Opi-nion
appear'd to be founded on a right
Judgment of things, (viz.) that they
were safe in the Votes of the Peers
who were already in the House, the
Question being carried in the House
by one Voice more than the Num-ber
of new Lords then created. The
Warmth of those People, who, at this
Time, pushed at the new Ministers,
may be judged of by that other In-cident
which attended at this Time,
(viz.) That the Occasional-Bill was
at this Time brought in by them,
which they had always opposed be-fore,
and which, it seems, was now
submitted to, in Favour of the E. of
N—'s Scheme, who declared
himself against the Administration
from this Time, for Reasons so mean,
as 
                  
                requires not to be remem-bred,
and who, however, forgot not to

                  
                a good Capitulation with those

                  
                surrendred to, and to gain this

Point of the Whiggs, which they had
always, till now, withstood; but
neither the E of N—insisting on
such high Terms for so mean an Ad-vantage,
as the best Service he could
do them, nor the Easiness of the
Whiggs at that Time, to part with
the Dissenters on such cheap Terms,
were by far, so wonderful, as the
Satisfaction with which the Dissen-ters
stood and lookt on while the
Fetters and Mannacles of this new
Law were fastened upon them; it
cannot be doubted, that secret En-gagements
were entered into between
the Parties, to take off this Law a-gain
by Parliament, when an Occa-sion
should offer: When that Occasi-on
shall be said to offer, Time must
shew. All the Use which Her Ma-jesty
made of these things, was to
see to what a Length those, who
resolved to oppose her Measures,
were come, and what Sacrifices they
would make, to bring about their
Schemes; but these things moved
Her not at all.
            
               

It was far more afflicting to her
Majesty, to see Her Servants clash-ing
with one another, in the Execu-tion
of Her Commands; and to see
the Endeavours, used by Herself, and
those who adhered to Her Pleasure,
ineffectual to the putting a Stop to
it; yet even these Evils, tho' dan-gerous
to the Administration, had
their Effect for the bringing about
the great Event which now came on
the Stage, concurring with the Mea-sures
of the Whiggs, so far as to make
it be still more and more Her Ma-jesty's
Opinion, that it was absolutely
necessary to put an End to the
War.
            The Treasurer's Opinion was not
material on the Subject of a Peace,
the Queen having declared, that it
was Her firm Resolution, if possible,
to be done upon just Conditions, to
put an End to the War; but the
Treasurer was more convinced of the
Necessity, as well as Justice of Her
Majesty's said Resolution, when he saw
not only the Warmth wherewith the

opposite Party opposed the Ministry,
even in carrying on the War; but the
Divisions apparently breaking into
the Administration, by the Power of
those, who set up a new Faction in
the Ministry, and by the Influence
they had, not only upon the Queen,
but upon the Members of Parliament,
and upon some useful People in most
Offices under her Majesty.
            
            Yet the Treasurer took no Steps
in the Affair of the Peace, till the
French, having made Proposals of
Peace to Her Majesty, it came be-fore
him to consider, whether those
Proposals were such as might lay a
Foundation for a solid Negotiation.
The Treasurer took nothing from
them otherwise than ad Referendum,
neither entered into any secret Nego-tiation
without Her Majesty's Directi-on
and Knowledge: What any other
Person might do, being employed or
directed by this new Faction, the
Treasurer accounts not for, any more
than he does for many of the Orders
and Directions given to the Persons

employed abroad to carry it on, in
which he had no Concern.
            
            The Treasurer cannot but hope,
that the present Enquiry, which is ma-king
into these things, will serve to
his Vindication in that Part, where-in
he suffers in the general Scandal
of other Mens actings, as if all things
had been directed by him; the con-trary
is evident in many other Cases
besides that of the Peace, wherein
his Part of the Negotiations seemed
rather to be, to set to Rights the
Mistakes made by others; and to
put them in the Way of a regular
Negotiation, after the most remiss
and disconcerted Conduct had
brought them into Confusion, as was
many times the Case: If the Treaty
suffered by those Steps, and if the
French were vigilant to make Advan-tage
of the People, who, they found,
acted with less Regularity than in a
Case of such Consequence they had
Reason to expect; the Treasurer has
the Satisfaction of seeing, that the
Advantages so made are the less, by

the Part he acted in that Matter, and
not the more.
            The Truth of what is said of the
Treasurer not being Master of the
Measures, by which the said new
Faction then acted, was evident from
their obtaining, without his Consent
or Knowledge, an Order from Her
Majesty, to pay the Sum of Twenty
Eight Thousand Thirty Six Pounds
Five Shillings for Arms, &amp;c. on the
Account of the Expedition to Cana-da;
which Sum the Treasurer scru-pled
to pay, for such Reasons as are
well known to be just, among which,
one was, that he had Reason to be-lieve
the said Demand was a Fraud,
that the Money was to be applyed to
private Use, and that the greatest
Part, if not all, was not to be em-ployed
in the Service for which it
was pretended to be asked; which
Reason likewise caused the Treasu-rer
to withdraw himself out of that
matter, and to refuse, for some time
before, to meet with those who trans-acted
it.
            
               

Neither will it be of any Force to
say, that the Breaches did not take
Effect till toward the End of that
Administration, and that the Trea-surer
was the sole Director for the
first Three Years, as some insinuate,
to take off the Force of these Re-marks;
for it is certain, that tho' the
open Discovery of these Divisions,
and their breaking out into a Flame,
did not appear without Doors till
after the Peace was finished; yet the
fatal Influence of them began, even
at the Beginning of the Ministry;
the Interest began to divide in Feb.
1710-11, and the Treasurer refu-sed
to meet in several Congres-ses
of their Allies; because he found
them carrying on criminal Intreagues
for the defrauding the Public, and
enriching themselves by the Spoils of
their Country.
            It would expose the new Faction
aforesaid, should it be made publick,
how they treated the Treasurer
for refusing to corrupt his Hands,
and stain his Integrity, with betray-ing
his Sovereign to those, who, he

awe, or any Way influence the Judg-ment
that shall be given in his Case;
that shall not so much as be ima-gined,
that the Votes of the Peers,
one Way or other, shall in the least
affect them in their Interest, or in
the Favour of His Majesty.
            It must be acknowledged, that in
this his Lordship acts from a Prin-ciple
of great Justice and Duty, as
well to His Majesty, as to the House
of Peers; and no Man can say, with-out
manifest Injury to his Majesty,
or to that Honourable House, that
he so much as believes his Lordship
will be the worst treated for that
dutiful and generous Behaviour.
            Without Doors we cannot say it
will be the same; it were to be
wished, the People, who shew such
a Warmth in their Desires to bring
on the Trial of this Lord, would
shew the like Disposition to having
him fairly acquitted, if his Innocence
shall appear, as they seem to shew
for his Destruction, on a Presumption
of his Guilt.
            
               

foresaw, would betray all to their
voratious Avarice; how he was ne-ver
to be forgiven the Omission of
such a Step; and that they would,
by no Means, be thought to have
Justice from him, if they were hin-der'd
from making a Prey of their
Country.
            It is because he strives not to load
any Man, much less those, who, he
fears, have already too much Guilt
to answer for, that he forbears to en-ter
into the detecting those Pra-ctices,
which he then abhorr'd; it is
enough to mention what those Men
too well know the Truth of, (viz.)
That from the Beginning he found
their Measures too much calculated
for private Advantage, without that
disinterested Aim at the publick Ser-vice,
which the Duty of Ministers of
State requir'd; and that, according
to his Duty, he, with Plainness and
Sincerity, told them his Thoughts of
it, in order to their reforming the
Principle from which they acted;
told the Queen of it, in order to pre-vent
Her Majesty's being impos'd up-on;

and being able to do no more,
withdrew from them in those things
which he did not approve; as, in
particular, that Affair of the Money
demanded for the Expedition to Ca-nada.
            
            In
which Affair, the Treasurer has
the Satisfaction of making it appear,
that he did not come into the Fraud;
and that, notwithstanding the Im-portunity
of the Persons, he resisted
their Demand of the Money, till such
repeated Orders were sent him to
comply with it from Her Majesty, as
he had no Power to withstand; and
likewise has had the Satisfaction to
find, that, since these things, Her
Majesty had an Opportunity to see the
Cheat more openly detected by his
Means; and to know, that whatever
was suggested by the Treasurer, of a
design'd Fraud in that Case, was
true.
            But what was yet more wonder-ful,
was, that the Persons concern'd
were not asham'd to vindicate them-selves
in this Practice; and to sug-gest,

that they ought to be allow'd
to do such things; signifying also
their great Resentment at the Trea-surer,
as if they were wrong'd by
him, in being restrain'd from those
things, which no honest Man could
allow.
            The Peace having been effectually
set on Foot in the Year 1712. met
with unexpected Opposition at Home;
and as it was thought that those of
the Allies, who seem'd to appear
most active against it Abroad, were
mov'd to do so, by the Impressions
which they receiv'd from hence; it
was, by Her Majesty's Command,
made his Province to set on Foot
such Negotiations in such Foreign
Courts as were necessary, in order to
undeceive the Princes and States A-broad,
as often as they had receiv'd
ill Impressions of Her Majesty's Inten-tions,
and to set Her Measures in a
true Light before them, that no Mis-constructions
might be made of Her
sincere Desires to act in Concert
with them, and for their Interests;
and, consequently, no fatal Misun-derstandings

might happen in, which
might separate the Allies one from
another, which would be a Means
to make the Advantages, which
might be obtain'd by an unanimous
Treaty, either less in themselves, or
difficult to obtain; and it is not to be
wonder'd, if the Treasurer should af-terwards,
in the Account of these
things which he laid before Her Ma-jesty
in the Year 1714. say, That,
during the first Year of the Peace,
his Hands were full of negotiating the
Peace in all Courts abroad; seeing the
Conduct of these Men, and the Mi-stakes
they made, made it often dif-ficult,
as well as troublesome, to re-concile
their Measures, and to di-stinguish
between what they had
done, and what Her Majesty intended
to have had them do.
            As to what was offer'd at Home
against the Negotiations of the Peace,
Her Majesty took little Notice of;
nor did it make any other Impression
on Her, than to convince Her more
and more, of the Necessity She was
under of finishing the War, and

confirming Her Opinion in the Rea-sonableness
of Her Negotiations. The
Opposition made about that Time
to the publick Administration, as well
of the Treasury, as of the military
Affairs, gave Her Majesty still less
Disturbance; for the Treasurer having
been supported by the needful Funds,
which the Parliament, with great
Duty and Application, dispatch'd, to
Her Majesty's Satisfaction, easily sur-mounted
the Difficulties which some
endeavour'd to cast in his Way,
in the procuring Money to carry on
the publick Affairs, and the Queen's
Business now began to be on a bet-ter
Foot than ever. The Party,
who, from the Beginning, had op-pos'd
Her Majesty's Measures at
Home, and embarrass'd them Abroad,
began to lose Courage, and to give
it over, finding the Queen resolved to
pursue Her just Designs, and Her
Servants in a Capacity to support
Her Administration, which they had
been very positive, in their Assurances
to the Foreign Courts in Alliance
with the Queen, could not be brought
to pass, and on the Miscarriage

whereof, the Sum of their Affair de-pended.
            As the said Assurances to the Fo-reign
Courts had created much Dif-ficulties
to the Ministers, and had
made the Negotiations very preca-rious;
so when the Failure of those
Assurances appear'd, as it did very
evident, by the withdrawing of some
Persons from the Kingdom, and by
the Submission of several active Peo-ple
at Home, and by the dutiful and
cheerful Concurrence of the Parlia-ment
then sitting; in which all the
Difficulties which could be started
by the malecontent Party, were
clear'd up, to the full Satisfaction of
the said Parliament, who evidently
came into the Peace, and even into
the Manner, or Terms of it: I say,
on the Failure of those Assurances
given from hence to some Foreign
Courts, and such necessary Steps as
were taken by the Treasurer, to as-sure
those Courts of the Sincerity of
Her Majesty's Intentions: Many of
those Courts appear'd satisfy'd, and
things went on in a free and open

Negotiation abroad for a while, with
more Success, and less Difficulty, than
before.
            Yet even in this Part, in which
they could contribute so little, did
the Persons abovementioned give the
publick Affairs all imaginable Ob-struction,
and make the Treasurer's
Work thereby exceedingly difficult,
by their frequent breaking in upon
Measures, acting rashly, and with-out
Concert, and perhaps sometimes
without sufficient Directions, or Or-ders,
in things of the nicest Nature;
in which the Treasurer's Interest with
them was so small, as that whatever
he could say to them on that Head,
was to very little Effect; and for
that Reason, as likewise because he
was willing to do nothing which
should render Her Majesty uneasy,
or obstruct Her Service, he gave
them as little Obstruction as pos-ssible.
            But
as Men, who agree but ill in
the right Management of their Of-fice,
are likely to agree worse with

themselves; so the Treasurer had fre-quently
his Hands full with the lesser
Broils, which they raised one among
another; and which, either by their
own Application, or by Her Maje-sty's
Order, it was often made his
Province to reconcile.
            It would take up much Time to
speak of these Matters, and especially
of the Conduct of the Secretary, then
Mr. St. John, before, at, and after his
having the Dignity of the Peerage
granted him by Her Majesty; in
which many are Witnesses to the
Treatment the Treasurer receiv'd from
the Passion of that Gentleman, and
his Friends; as it relates to the De-lay
of his Advancement at first, and
his being ill satisfy'd with the Degree
of it, when granted: The Particulars
of which, though Her Majesty's
Conduct was so just, and supported
with such Reasons, as could not but
be submitted to by all his Friends;
yet were receiv'd by him with such
Resentment at the Treasurer, as it has
not been usual for Men of like Sta-tion

to meet with, or for Ministers
of State to give to one another.
            It cannot be doubted, but this
Conduct, as it obstructed the publick
Affairs on one Hand; so it expos'd
them much on the other; lessen'd the
Esteem of the Persons, as well as the
Power of Her Majesty's Servants,
and brought the Administration into
Contempt, both at Home and A-broad;
and, which was still worse,
exceedingly disturbed Her Majesty,
divided Her Esteem this Way or that,
as Her Majesty found to Day this
Person, to Morrow that, acting up
to, or below the Duty of their Sta-tion;
distracted the publick Councils,
and oftentimes caus'd Her Majesty to
shift. Her Service out of one Hand,
and into another, which gave much
Dissatisfaction to the Queen in several
things; and Her Majesty failed not
oftentimes to signify Her Displeasure
at these things; which it was much
more easy for Her Majesty to do,
than to find a Remedy for them.
            
               

This caus'd the Treasurer, after
things were brought to a length not
to be otherwise accommodated, and
after he had, in vain, by long Letters,
as well as by frequent speaking to
the other Persons, prest them to a
stricter and quieter Application to
their Duty, to represent these things
to Her Majesty, in the plainest and
best Terms he could; giving Her
Majesty an Account of the distinct
Circumstances She then stood in,
with reference to the said uneasy
Persons; as also of the Scituation of
Her Affairs at that Time; and how
Her Administration then appear'd by
their Management, to be encumber'd
with Difficulties not easy to get
through; but yet ending with pro-posing
due Remedies for the Evils
which attended it.
            It is true, one of the best Reme-dies
for the said Evils, had been an
Unanimity of Councils, and adjoin-ing
all the Queen's Servants together
in a strict Friendship to one another,
and a mutual Discharge of their Du-ty

It is now come to the great Que-stion:
Nothing less than his Life,
or his Death, is the Case. If we
were to make a Judgment of him
by the Opinions and Tempers of Men
without Doors, it would be easy to
conclude, what should be his Fate;
and his Courage must be thought
greater than his Discretion, to put
himself upon his Tryal; which
makes the Honour done to the Ju-stice
and Impartiality of His Majesty,
and the Peers, of which mention is
made already, be the greater.
            Yet we would hope, that seeing it
is now brought this length, Men
will begin to be more serious, and
forbear to importune the Justice
of the Nation, by their Invectives,
and indecent Treatment: My Lord
has appealed from the Clamours of
the People, to the Justice and Ho-nour
of the Peers; and being thus
in the Hands of Justice, what is there
that Men can desire more? They
who occupy their Pens or Tongues,
now to blacken, defame, or reproach

to Her Majesty, that each acting
in their proper Sphere, or particular
Province, with a clear and disinter-ested
View to Her Majesty's Service,
might go on in a good Understand-ing
with one another, and a perfect
Harmony of Desires for the publick
Good, and a just Subservience to
Her Majesty's Pleasure.
            To this Purpose, the Treasurer, as
well in his Letter to the Lord Boling-broke,
as in several Papers and Schemes
which he gave in by Her Majesty's
Command, to regulate these Mis-chiefs,
always adher'd to the first
Opinion which he had profess'd in
the Time of the former Administra-tion,
and of which mention has
been made, viz. That every Mi-nister
should confine himself to
his especial Province, concurring
therein to the general Interest of the
Sovereign, and endeavouring always
to lay before Her Majesty a true
State of Her Affairs, should then act
with Subservience to Her Commands,
and in Concert with one another, for
Her Interest and Service: This the

               Treasurer always back'd with just Re-presentations
of what was the parti-cular
Province of the Person he wrote
to; and not without earnestly pres-sing
him to enter into just Measures
for the Discharge of the Matters im-mediately
before them, and with
Schemes for the carrying on the pub-lick
Business so, as to make it easy
to the Queen, and to themselves.
            Instead of just Returns to these,
he was continually attack'd with
Quarrels and Complaints, new and
private Schemes of their own; some
of which were form'd upon Principles
that he could not, in Duty, comply
with; and upon his rejecting such
Schemes, but especially upon his
prevailing with Her Majesty to enter
so far into the redressing these things,
as to make a Nomination of Officers,
different from their Proposals, by a
Scheme of the Treasurer's; upon thi
                  •
               
Step, I say, he was treated ever
with Outrage; nor could they be e-ver
brought to any Rules or Me-sures,
in Concert with the whole
Ministry, ever after; till the Treasurer,
to his great Satisfaction, withdraw

out of publick Business, and obtain'd
the Favour of Her Majesty to be dis-miss'd
from an Administration, in which
he had so little Influence, as not to
be able to do his Duty; and yet so
great an Unhappiness, as to be
charged with all the Mistakes which
other Men made,
            The Treasurer cannot but think
the timely Dismiss he receiv'd, be-ing
the last Favour his Royal Mi-stress
liv'd to do him, was the most
happy Turn from Heaven that be-fel
him through the whole Course of
his Life, seeing it will testify for him,
in any Examination which may
hereafter be made into these things,
that the Mistakes which may have
been made in the Time of his Ad-ministration,
have happen'd rather
from the Want of Power in him to
prevent them, than from his hav-ing
the governing Influence in the
Ministry, as has been suggested;
that his Part of the Negotiations a-broad,
has been rather to rectify
what they had done amiss, than to
act by himself; and that no irregular

Steps have been taken by him, no
unwarrantable Practices, no evil
Council given by him; and that his
only Misfortune, next to his having
been supposed to be the Author of
evil Councils, has been, that he has
not been able to prevent the Effects
of them, or to deliver the Queen
from them, whose Illness, many can-not
but still believe, receiv'd not a
little Encrease from the Trouble these
things gave Her Majesty, and the
Grief of seeing the irreconcileable
Clashings of Her Servants.
            But to go back to the Peace: It
seems, in all the Speeches about the
Transaction of that Affair, the Ob-jections
lie rather against the Me-thods
taken to bring it to pass, than
against the Illegality of the Ministers
being employ'd to bring the War to
an End; which, nevertheless, seems
to be the previous Question; and
here we find, that the proper En-quiry
was, as to the Treasurer, Whe-ther
he has acted legally, in obeying
the Queen's Commands, or not? If
any of the Ministers with, or with-out

his Knowledge and Consent,
enter'd upon Measures, in carrying
on the Treaty, unjustifiable by the
Laws of the Land; their separate
Management will, questionless, ap-pear
the plainer; and the Treasurer,
when every Man shall answer
for himself, will still be the more
openly vindicated from the Asper-sion
mention'd above, of having the
Direction of the whole Affair in him-self.
            As
Her Majesty found Reasons to
resolve to put an End to the War;
Her Minister, whether ther enter'd
into Her Majesty's Reasons, or not,
would find themselves oblig'd to en-ter
into Her Measures for the bring-ing
it to pass; whether the Reasons
which mov'd Her Majesty to this Re-solution,
were Her own, or were
rais'd from the Counsel given to
Her by any Person in whom Her Ma-jesty
repos'd so much Confidence, as
to be prevail'd with by their Advice;
whether Her Majesty was mov'd by
the Tendency so natural to Her, and
the Compassion mov'd in Her Breast,

by the Expence of the Blood of Her
People; some having said, this was
the first and only Motive; but
supposing it was by the Counsel of
Her Servants from other Motives,
and be those Motives what they will,
it seems no Part of the present De-fence
of the late Treasurer, unless there
appear'd some Ground for a Charge
upon him, as being the Person who
advis'd, counsell'd, or mov'd Her
Majesty to it, or to enter into any
Measures with France for that Pur-pose;
which, on the strictest View
of all that yet appears in publick,
does not seem to be so much as pre-tended
to.
            While then it remains unenquir'd
into, who first mov'd Her Majesty to
enter into Measures for making a
Peace; and the Queen's undoubted
Prerogative empower'd Her Majesty
to enter into, and finish Negotiations
to that Purpose; It seems, that all
the Enquiries into the Correspondence
between Her Majesty's first Resoluti-ons,
and the subsequent Measures,
will necessarily be plac'd to the Ac-count

of such Intervention of Acci-dents,
as caus'd Her Majesty to change
Her Thoughts; and that the Mini-stry
cannot justly be charged to bring
to pass those Resolutions, and those
Changes, by Way of Intriegue, or
with Design to carry on the Treaty
with the more Disguise; this would
be to make the Queen's Servants
guilty of betraying the Queen in the
most infamous Manner, and expos-ing
the Honour of Her Majesty's Word
in a most gross and unjustifiable
Manner; and if any such thing
could be prov'd, the Treasurer would
have no other Work before him, than
to publish his Detestation of such
Practices, and wash his Hands
of the Guilt.
            On the other Hand, it is humbly
conceiv'd, That all such Expressions
as are insisted on by some in the
Queen's Letters, Messages, or Speeches,
to the Allies, or their Ministers,
in which Her Majesty declar'd Her
Resolution to carry on the War; to
make no separate Treaty; to procure
just Satisfaction to Her Allies, &amp;c.
               

are to be expounded by the Grand
Alliance; and to be built upon the
Supposition, That Her Allies acted ac-cording
to all their Engagements
with Her Majesty in the said Alliance;
otherwise Her Majesty would be un-derstood
to oblige Herself to all that
might be contain'd in those Expres-sions,
whether Her Allies continu'd
to discharge their Part or no; and,
in the Consequence of such an Opi-nion,
the Queen might at length be
alone in the War, under the literal
Obligation of those Letters, Speeches,
&amp;c.
            
            But it was the Opinion of the
Queen at that Time, and of many of
Her Servants, That the Allies, par-ticularly
the States and the Emperor,
had not done their Part in the War;
and had not discharg'd their Engage-ments
to Her Majesty; and even the
Parliament themselves, in the Repre-sentation
of the House of Commons to
the Queen, (Reference being had
thereto) did confirm that Opinion;
nay, Her Majesty found, that no Com-plaint
from hence had the desir'd Ef-fect,

to oblige the said Powers to
act in another Manner; but were
productive only of Memorials and
Letters, extenuating, or justifying
themselves; and in these things are
said more particularly to be form'd
Her Majesty's first Resolutions.
            Nor was this a Transaction of that
Day only; it had been thus before:
And this Her Majesty had long been
acquainted with, in the Time of the
Earl of Godolphin's Administration,
when, as has been credibly said, his
Lordship having frequently pressed
those Allies to perform the Conditi-ons
of the Grand Alliance; and to fur-nish
their Quota's and Contingents, as by
the several Conventions and Stipula-tions,
subsequent to the said Treaty of
Grand Alliance, they were oblig'd to
do; receiv'd for Answer more than
once, and that to Her Majesty's great
Grief; That their State was empo-verish'd;
that they were able to do
no more; and that unless his Lordship,
meaning the then Treasurer, would
supply the extraordinary Charge,
they could not carry on the War;

and must make their own Peace on
the best Conditions they could, or to
this Effect. If these things then were
justifiable on the Part of any of Her
Majesty's Allies; they were much more
to be defended on the Part of Her
Majesty, and Her Servants; though
they were led by these things in the
Method they were to take with the
same Allies, even by a natural Re-turn.
            Likewise
in the Methods taken
by some of the Allies, to reject, and
render ineffectual the Treaty for a
Peace, when it was set on Foot at

                  Ʋtrecht; and to put an End to it by
the Operations of the Campaign; Her
Majesty thought She saw so resolv'd a
Combination, not against a Peace
only, but even against a Treaty,
without enquiring whether it might
have been concluded to Advantage or
no; which combination Her Majesty
thought was not only inconsistent
with, but contrary to, the express
Declaration of the States, of their be-ing
desirous of Peace; that Her Ma-jesty,
and likewise Her Servants, were

him, openly challenge the House of
Peers, reproach their Justice, and
villify that August Assembly, as if
not disposed to do Justice in the
Case when it comes before them:
As his Lordship has thrown himself
upon the Honour and Justice of the
Peers, and put his Life and Honour
into their Lordships Hands; so
should we do, and not either lead
or direct them, which would be, in
the grossest Manner, to suspect their
Proceedings.
            The Clamours which have hither-to
been made on this Account, have
been, as the Authors pretended, on-ly
to have Men impeached; and we
have seen Writers tell the Govern-ment,
They expect it: It is now done,
we hope they will be satisfy'd, and
not tell the House of Peers, whether
they shall acquit or condemn: This
must be left in their own Breasts;
and there is no Doubt but they will
act as Justice, and their own Honour,
shall direct; and of this we must all
wait the Issue.
            
               

of Opinion, That Her Majesty was
justly disengag'd from all that had
been said, promised, or stipulated be-tween
them before; and was not at
Liberty only, but bound by the
strictest of all the Obligations which
a good Prince could be bound by,
to provide for the Safety and Ease of
Her own Subjects, by a Peace, whe-ther
in Conjunction with, or separate
from those Allies; in the mean Time,
nevertheless, providing as well as
possible, for the Satisfaction of all
Her Allies; if they thought fit to
come into Her Measures, for their
own, and the general Satisfaction.
            This may appear more especially
from the Instructions given to his
Grace the Duke of Ormond, when he
went over General of Her Majesty's
Forces; wherein his Grace's Orders
begin thus:
            You are, with all possible Diligence, to
repair to the Hague; and to acquaint
the Pensionary, That, having ap-pointed
you to command our Army in the
Netherlands, we have given you Orders

to see him before you go to put your
self at the Head of the Troops. You are
to express to him the Resolution we are
in, of pressing the War with all possible
Vigour, until the Enemy shall agree to
such Terms of Peace, as may be safe and
honourable for us, and for our Allies.
            You are farther to say to this Mini-ster,
That you are prepar'd to live in a
perfect good Correspondence with all the
Generals of the Allies, and particularly
with those of the States; and that you
hope, you shall find the same Inclination
on their Part, to which his (the Pensio-nary)
good Offices will extremely con-tribute.
You are, after this Introducti-on,
to desire the Pensionary to inform
you what Plan has been agreed upon for
the Operations of the Campaign.
            The Duke, it seem, is of Opini-on,
that when his Grace came to the
Hague, and, pursuant to these In-structions,
communicated the Queen's
Pleasure, as well to the Pensionary, as
to the Deputies of the Council of
State, they declin'd him; receiv'd
the Proposals in a manner less ob-liging
than Her Majesty thought She

had Reason to expect; and it is e-vident,
that they refus'd to commu-nicate
their Measure to him, but re-ferr'd
him to the Deputies in their
Army; as may be seen in the Ac-count
given to the Publick by his
Grace, in his Book, Entitul'd;Vid. pag. 2 or 3. 
               The
Couduct of the Duke of Ormond.
            This Quotation is needful, in or-der
to state the Case, as it then ap-pear'd
to Her Majesty's Servants, at
the Time when Proposals came over
from M. de Torcy, in the King of
France's Name, in order to set on
Foot a Negotiation for a Peace; and
which, by the Grand Alliance, Her
Majesty was not prohibited receiv-ing;
and, consequently, the Ministers
could not be blam'd for receiving it
in Her Majesty's Name; if, in the
Pursuit of the Negotiations which have
follow'd, they have acted illegally,
that must appear upon due Examina-tion,
and must lie upon those, who
it can be prov'd, by good Evidence,
were guilty.
            
               

The Treasurer's Part in these things,
can lie only in the general Trans-action,
(viz.) The approving of the
entring upon the Treaty, the parti-cular
Negotiation not being his Pro-vince;
except that his Share above-mention'd,
which seem'd to be rather
the Necessity he found sometimes to
rectify the Mistakes which some,
by their private Divisions, and their
other Practices, had run themselves
into, than that he manag'd any
Part of the Treaty: But the whole
Affair was transacted in the Council;
or by the Secretary of State; or by the
Queen through them both.
            Moreover, it recurs back to what
is observed before, That such was the
growing Breach among the Queen's
Servants at this Time, that, not be-ing
in Terms of Peace with one a-nother,
they were ill qualify'd to con-sult
one another in the Affair of mak-ing
Peace abroad; it is hop'd, for
their Sakes, they have made no Slips;
if it should be otherwise, their Ene-mies
will not fail to make their Ad-vantage
thereof. But as to the Trea-surer,
               

it is evident, that as it was not
his Province to correspond with the
Ministers abroad; so he is not to an-swer
for those that did.
            It may seem strange, that in car-rying
on this Account of the Con-duct
of this Minister, who Fame has
so often spoken of, as at the Head of
all Affairs, it has not yet occurr'd
to speak of the Pretender, or so much
as once to mention such a Person;
but that he seems to lie out of the
Question, as much as if there were
no such Person in the World; and
this is the more wonderful, because
of the Pains which has been taken
in the World, to load the Treasurer
with the Guilt of this, among the
rest; and even to assure the World,
that this, among other things, would
be prov'd upon him, as clear as the
Sun at Noon Day; notwithstanding
which, some of his Enemies acknow-ledge
now, that even in all the Ex-aminations
into that Matter, that they
do not see, that one Step, in Favour
of the Pretender, can be prov'd upon
him; neither do we find yet, that

those appointed to examine into it,
have charg'd him with any thing of
that kind.
            The most which the Examinations
which have been taken of that Mat-ter
seem to import, amount to no
more than this; That some People
in the Ministry knew of, or con-niv'd
at his being permitted to
reside in the Dominions of the Duke
of Lorrain: But all of them grant,
that in all the Negotiations, they
were strictly enjoin'd to insist upon
his being oblig'd to quit the Domi-nions
of France; so that they do not
pretend to any thing done in the
Treaty in his Favour, or of that
kind, that could be useful to his De-sign;
nor is it alledg'd, that the Ob-ligations
laid on the French King, not
any Ways to aid or assist him, or to
admit his Return, are not as full
and as pungent, as Words could ex-press;
which Treaty therefore being
so calculated to remove the Pre-tender
from the Assistance of the
French, and from his Dominions,
seem'd to answer all the Ends of the

most fixed and resolv'd Enemies to
his Interest, not valuing whether he
might think fit to go; seeing if the
French King kept his Word invio-lably,
his near Residence in Lorrain
would be of small Advantage to
him; and if otherwise, his remoter
Residence could have been no more
Obstruction to him, than the Diffe-rence
of a few Days in his Journey,
when he should have been recall'd;
adding withal, that at the remoter
Distance of Rome, or Venice, he would,
with much greater Ease, have re-mov'd
without Notice, and been
able to have pass'd incognito, when-ever
he had any Design so to do,
than he can do where he now is.
            So that on the whole; As in the
Treaty they took effectual Care to
tie up the French King, from giving
any Assistance to the Pretender, and
put the Necessity upon him, of ba-nishing
him for ever from his Domi-nions,
the Queen seem'd to have
done all that was of Movement to be
done; and if any one conniv'd at
the Place of his Residence, in Fa-vour

of his pretending to the Crown
of Great Britain, such an one was so
far guilty of a trayterous Confede-racy
with the Pretender.
            
            It is observ'd by some, that the Af-fair
of the Pretender was the Pro-vince
of the Abbot Gautier, who was
a French Minister residing here dur-ing
the Negotiations; but it dose not
yet appear, or at least we do not
find, that any thing was transacted
for him, but what related to the
Place where he should go; and that
so as he might not be surpriz'd by
the Emperor; and even this seems to
have been left undecided; and that
the Queen afterwards finding it was
the Occasion of Uneasiness among
Her People, did earnestly press to
have him remov'd; all which can
afford but small Ground to suggest,
as is done, That the Ministry had a
reserv'd Design to make him King
of Britain.
            
            This, however, not at all affect-ing
the Treasurer, had not been men-tion'd
in this Place, but to remind

the Reader of the Injury the Trea-surer
receiv'd, during the Time of
these Negotiations, as well as since,
in being openly reflected on, as in
the Interest of the Pretender; where-as,
upon the narrowest Scrutiny, it
is believ'd it will appear, that not
one Step has been, at any time,
taken by him; or that the least Sha-dow
of any thing will be found,
that looks like favouring that Person's
Interest: On the other Hand, it is
apparent, That the Treasurer has all
along been hated and malign'd by
the Jacobite Party here, as their
greatest and most dangerous Enemy;
that they openly rejoic'd when he
was dismiss'd from the high Station
which he acted in before; and that
as soon as the first Division among
the Ministry appear'd, they eminent-ly
shew'd themselves against the
Treasurer, and in the Interest of the
other; which was a Testimony of
the best kind, namely, of the Enemy in
Behalf of the Treasurer; and signifi-ed,
that if they had any Hopes of
their Interest in any Side, it was in
those who were now opposing the

               Treasurer to the utmost: These things,
if any thing will do it, may open
the Eyes of some Men, to see the In-justice
they have done to the Treasu-rer
in these things; and how inju-riously
he has been all along treated
by them.
            The Treasurer standing in this Po-sture,
with respect to the Ministry
at Home, in cannot be suppos'd but
that many things, in the Transaction
of the Peace, were actually done,
not without his Consent only, but
that he entirely declin'd to inter-meddle
with those things which he
did not approve. It was, no doubt,
the Duty of the Plenipotentiaries, to
leave such Articles as they could
not legally adjust, to the Parliament
of Great Britain to ratify, or reject;
and therefore the VIII and IX Ar-ticles
of the Treaty of Commerce,
which related to the taking off of
Duties on several Merchandizes im-ported,
could not be finally con-cluded,
or otherwise settled, than
by referring them to the Parliament,
by whom the several Duties being ap-propriated

That we may attend this great
Event with less Curiosity and Im-patience,
it may be proper to state
the Facts of this noble Lord's Con-duct,
as they appear at present in
those very Cases wherein he is so
much impugned and attack'd, that
when People have cool Thoughts
about them, they may be disposed
to read them over; perhaps when
they have done so, they will be the
backwarder to blame the House of
Peers, if they should not find it as
they may expect.
            In the latter End of King William's
Reign, we found Mr. Harley chosen
Speaker of the House of Commons.
He was, in the Session before, one of
those Members, who stood firm to the
Resolution of disbanding the Army;
having always an Opinion, that the
Security of the Prince was sufficient-ly
provided for in the Affection of
his faithful Commons; and that all
the Dangers, which, as was then
pretended, appeared from the grow-ing
Power of France, were far less,

to particular Purposes, could
alone be taken off: But when these
things came to be laid before the
Parliament, it seems, it was Subject of
great Complaint against the Treasurer,
that he was unwilling, or declin'd to
have the Ministry espouse the making
those Articles effectual; whereas it was
the Treasurer's Opinion, That the Mi-nistry
should entirely leave the Mer-chants
to act as they thought fit; and
leave the House to act at the Merchants
Requests, and as their own Wisdome should
direct them; the Ministry standing
entirely neuter.
            But this likewise he was over-rul'd
in; and the rest of the Ministers
thinking themselves oblig'd to support
at Home, what they had transacted
Abroad, brought in their whole Strength
into the Debate, and, making it a
Party Affair, lost it in the House of
Commons, by that very Means, and
no other: In all which Matter, the
Treasurer remain'd passive, and un-concern'd;
though with this Injustice
also on him, viz. That he suffer'd
the Reproaches of the Whigs, for e-spousing

the Bill of Commerce; and
of the other Part of the Ministry, for
not espousing it.
            It would be endless to go through
the Detail of these particular Cases,
in which the Province of the Treasu-rer
was no other, than to bear infi-nite
Calumny for those Follies, which
he had no Share in, but had not
Power to prevent; and this made him
frequently say, That he was out of
Office near a Year before he was out of
Place; and indeed, for some of the
last Months that he remain'd in the
Place, he had little to do in the pub-lick
Affairs, but to complain of this
injurious Usage, viz. That he was ob-lig'd
to see things done that he could
not approve of; and then to hear
them call'd his Doing.
            Under these Unhappinesses he be-came
an humble Petitioner to Her
Majesty, either to deliver him from
these Men, or to dismiss him from
the Service: At first he prevail'd, to
their great Uneasiness, to have a new
Settlement of Great Officers made;

which, as he knew it overthrew the
Schemes which the other People had
laid; so he had Hopes it would, at length,
put the Affairs in a Course of Ma-nagement,
as would retrieve the Con-fusion
they were at that time in:
This was when Her Majesty appoint-ed
the Duke of Shrewsbury Lieutenant
of Ireland; Lord Finlater, to be Chan-cellor
of Scotland; the Earl of Marr,
third Secretary of State; Lord Dart-mouth,
Lord Privy Seal; and Mr. Brom-ley,
Secretary of State, in Lord Dart-mouth's
Room; Sir William Wyndham,
Chancellor of the Exchequer; and the
Duke of Ormond, to command in chief
in Britain.
            
            It is impossible to express the Out-rage
of the other Persons, who now
own'd they look'd but like a FA-CTION
in the Ministry; but gave
out threatning Speeches plentifully,
that they would soon destroy this
new Scheme: The Trouble likewise
which this gave to the Queen Herself,
cannot be spoken of without Grief;
especially when it must be remember-ed,
how near it was to that fatal Di-stemper

which remov'd Her Majesty
to a Throne, uncapable of such Per-turbation
and Dissatisfaction.
            It was not indeed very long e're
Her Majesty perceiv'd that they
would never cease attacking Her on
these Heads, and began something to
yield to their Importunities; which
the Treasurer perceiving, renew'd his
Applications to Her Majesty, to the
same Purpose as before: And in this
Interval it was, that he receiv'd Her
Majesty's Command, to lay before Her
a true State of Her Affairs; which
Command he cheerfully obey'd, in
Hopes the doing so might either for-tify
Her Majesty's Resolutions in the
Model of Administration lately enter'd
upon, or replace himself in that Re-cess
from Business, and from the Scan-dal
of other Mens Mistakes, which he
so much desir'd.
            This Account the Treasurer laid be-fore
Her Majesty the 9th of June;
the Title whereof was as follows:
            
               
                  
                     
                        

                        A brief Account of publick Affairs since
August the 8th, 1710. to this pre-sent
8th of June, 1714. To which
is added, The State of Affairs
Abroad, as they relate to this
Kingdom; with some humble Pro-posals
for securing the future
Tranquillity of Her Majesty's Reign,
and the Safety of Her King-doms.
                     
                  
               
            
            Together with this Account, the Trea-surer
sent Her Majesty the following Let-ter;
and, in a few Days after, the Queen
did him the Honor of granting his hum-ble
Petition, (viz.) of laying the Staff
at Her Majesty's Feet: The Letter as
follows:
            
               
                  
                     May it please Your Majesty,
                  
                  I Presume, in Obedience to Your
Royal Commands, to lay before
Your Majesty a State of Your Af-fairs.
Though I have very much
contracted it from the Draught I
made, and the Vouchers from

whence it is taken; yet I find it
swell under my Pen in Transcrib-ing,
being willing to put every
Thing before Your Majesty in the
clearest Light my poor Understand-ing
can attain to. It was necessary
to lay it before Your Majesty in
the Series of Time, from the Begin-ning
to this present Time; and
when that is compleatly laid before
You, it remains only for me, to
beg God to direct Your Majesty.
                  And as to my self, do with me
what You please; place me either
as a Figure, or a Cypher; dis-place
me, or replace me, as that best
serves Your Majesty's Occasions,
You shall ever find me, with the ut-most
Devotion, and without any
Reserve,
                  
                     MADAM,
                     Your most Dutiful, most Faithful,
most Humble, most Obedient Subject,
and Ʋnworthy Servant,
OXFORD.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               

Thus ended a troublesome Admini-stration
of a few Years; in which the
Treasurer may truly say, He enjoy'd
the Place, but never could execute the
Office; and though it is true, that
he had all the Envy, and bore the
Weight of all the evil Conduct of o-ther
Men; yet nothing can be truer,
than that they not only influenc'd
the publick Affairs, distinctly from
him; but that they carry'd every
thing their own Way, even over the
Belly of the Treasurer; and had the
particular Direction of those things,
of which he had the Scandal, for all
their ill Management lies at his Door,
in the Esteem of his Enemies; and is,
to this Hour, improv'd to his Hurt,
as much as some Men are able.
            It was, as has been said, but a short
while after this Representation to Her
Majesty, that the Queen thought fit to
accept the Treasurer's Cession of the
Staff; a certain Evidence, that their
Influence had a prevailing Force with
Her Majesty, who would never else
have consented to admit such Men
               

into Her Administration, who, it had
been prov'd, had defrauded the Pub-lick
of above 20000 Pounds in Mo-ney
but just before; and who had so
evidently been detected in that Fraud
by him, who Her Majesty suffer'd to
lay down.
            From hence it is argu'd, That the
Knowledge of these things was one
Reason, why the Queen, after the
Treasurer was actually displaced, had
yet such a Prepossession against those
Men, that, to their inexpressible Mor-tification,
Her Majesty gave the Office
of Lord Treasurer to his Grace the
Duke of Shrewsbury; a Person in the
last Scheme of the Treasurer; and
therefore hated mortally by the new
Faction, so we must still call them; and
a Person, in whose Advancement they
were more confounded than before.
            Had the Queen immediately entred
into the Measures of those Men, who
perswaded Her to dismiss the Treasu-rer,
She would certainly have like-wise
receiv'd their Friends into such
Places as they had determin'd for

them; and then a few Months longer
would have discover'd what they aim-ed
at: The Treasurer, how ill an O-pinion
soever he had of their Capa-city,
had, nevertheless, this Hope, That
they would not take any Step in
Favour of the Pretender; but always
kept himself in Readiness to have de-tected
them in the first Steps they
should have made that Way.
            But Her Majesty's Distemper and
Death intervening, surpriz'd them all;
put an End to all their projected
Schemes at once; and, among the
rest, had this one Unhappiness, that it
prevented the late Treasurer, and de-priv'd
him of the Opportunity of
convincing Her Majesty, by the Conse-quences
of the fatal Tendency of these
Councils; and how naturally they
would embroil Her Affairs, both at
Home and Abroad.
            Upon the present Enquiries made
by the Authority of Parliament into
these Matters, it seems, that some of
these Men have not Confidence enough
in the Justice of their own Measures,

to defend them in a Parliamentary
Manner; but have retir'd, for the
present; whether it shall be constru'd
to signify, their pleading guilty to the
Charge, shall not be enter'd into
here; but certain it is, that they
must know the Treasurer may have
something to say to them, which
they are not very well dispos'd to
hear.
            The Treasurer not doubting the
Justice of those, who the Laws of this
Nation have made Judges of these
things, APPEARS, and manifests
thereby his Readiness to cast his
Life, his Honour, and his Fortunes,
upon the Honour and Impartiality of
the Peerage of Great Britain; as be-ing
assur'd, that nothing shall be there
laid upon him, which cannot be fixt
by the Testimony of good Witnesses;
and that he shall not be censur'd by
their Lordships for those Transactions,
which have been the Work of other
Hands; and that he shall not only
have full Scope given him, for clear-ing
up his Innocence in all the Points
charged against him; but likewise a
