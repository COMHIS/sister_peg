               What passes in the Dark Third Row,
               And what behind the Scene,
               Coaches and crip'led Chairs I know,
               And Garrets hung with Green;
               I know the swing of sinful Hack,
               Where many Damsels cry alack.

               V.
               In truth by what I can discern,
               Of Courtiers 'twixt you Three,
               Some Wit you have and more may Learn,
               From Court than Gay or Me,
               
               Perhaps in time you'll leave High Diet,
               To Sup with Us on Mirth and Quiet,
               
                  With a fa, la, la.
               
            
            
               VI.
               At Leicester-Fields a House full high,
               With Door all Painted Green,
               Where Ribbons Wave upon the Tye,
               (A Milliner I mean)
               There may you Meet Us Three to Three,
               For Gay can well make Two of Me.
               
                  With a fa, la, la.
               
            
            
               VII.
               But shou'd you catch the Prudish Itch,
               And each become a Coward,
               Bring sometimes with you Mistress R
                        _…

                     d.
               
               For Virgins to keep Chaste must go
               Abroad with such as are not so.

               VIII.
               And thus Fair Maids my Ballad ends,
               God send the King Safe Landing,
               And make all Honest Ladies Friends,
               To Armies that are Standing,
               Preserve the Limits of these Nations,
               And take off Ladies Limitations.
