The species separates into bands and companies; but the individual, leldom from choice, is found to fubilt alone.
Varieties in human nature are either such as diitinguill diiierent races of men, different ages of the fame race, or individuals of the fame race and age.
Races are difltilguified by their seatures, ft;:ture, CcImpl1ciun, dii)Uitions, andi cultics.

Different ages of the fame race are diflinguifhed by the unequal possession of commercial, literary, and political arts.
Ages are said to be savage, barbarous, or polithed.
During the first, men live on terms of equality, without property or government.
During the second, they are ditlinguilled by inequalities of birth and fortune, associate in tribes, and follow their leaders.
During the third, they find additional grounds of diitinction, in a divcrfity of education, profellion, and manner of life. They are governed by nwagiItrates, hereditary or elective, under the diredtion of laws and ettablilled forms.
6. Individuals of the fame race are diftinguilhed by a difference of asped, capacity, disposition, and force.
These varieties qualify members of the fame society for different tiations, and render subordination confiitent with natural equality.
7. Every slate in which man can employ his talents, and follow his difpofitions, is a state of nature.
   Of the Hif/oly of the INDIVIDUAL.
SECTION I. Of the UNDERSTANDING.  IIE Individual is conscious of his 
personal identity, in the performance of many funtions, either merely animal, intellectu  or mixed.
Consciousness is a principal attribute of mind ; and is that by which it may be Iaid to cxiit for itself.
Merely animal functions are those in which bodily organs and mere animal powers are exerted ; as, dli:cltiuoi, circulation, & 
IntelleCtual fiin(tions are such as cannot be referred to any bo)lilv organ ; as thought, juJldeincllt, andl tcfire.

Mixed funclions are the proceedings of mindl referred to bodily organs ; as, fen!clion, and appetite.
2. The mixed or intellecial fundtions of this alcive being, however otherwise dilinguillied, terminate in either of two ends ; the discovery of Lrutb, or the attainment of good.
Truth is the relation of our belief or opinion to the reality of things.
Good is a quality of sentiment, and can exiit only in a feiitient nature.
Truth is the obljct of underitanding. Good is the obiett of will.

Dcfcriptive history is tlhc detail of co-cxiitcnt circunmftances and qu. li tics.

 Memory is intentional when the mind from design recollects any object.  imagination is tle stating objects as present under a sense of their absence, or as real under a sense of tleir being fidtitious. efign, invcntion, description, andl plifion, or desire, depend on imagination.

 There are foul kinds of enjoyment or furlcring; viz.
i. Sensations of Pleasure or Pain. 2. Approbation or Dillike. 3. AffeCion or Hatred. 4. Exercise or Languor. The irfit pertains to our Animal and Sensitive beiii;.
The otlhers to our Intelledtual and Adive nature.

Juitlgen;enits of approbation or diflike are plcalint or painful fioml a klInco)letldg and dlifceirnicnit of their ,lcjcl; as in difliiguihil what is lturtitiil or ldcfoIrnld, girc'at or ine.an.

lnclination is a disposition of our nature to at.
Every inclination may be confidered, either in refpeEl to itself, to its end, or to its objedt.
In rcfpeat to itself, Inclination is of three kinds.
i. A propenlity; 2. A desire; or, 3. A mixture of both.
A Propensity is an origin or acquired difpictionl of our nature, op':rating inepl' ilt:  *i'i' lfi.:ion or dcltin. ciive is tle i;ntlcniona aC of the minil, dir-ecle. by the apprehenlion of a fin 'oleid good.
Natu re andl halbit give propensities; info-i;-mation or fancy lmay excite dcfire.
Propentities, a.ftcr experience of their gratification, part:ikc in the lure of Dcfire; and lDeiircs, by haLit, partake in the nature of !'i-openlitics.
The fuljedt of Inclination is the cnd or fiplpofcd good to which it refter;
;Is,
as, when we delire Animal Enjoyments, Intelledtual Talents, or MIoral zualities.
The object of Inclination is tile person to whose enjoyment tlhe supposed good is referred ; as in the cafe of advantages desired for ourselves or others.
In this refpeL inclinations are felfifl or benevolent.
The mint is differently affedled by pafTion as the fubjct of inclination is differently situated.
Paflions are of four principal kinds : Joy and Grief; Hope and Fc;  A good obtained is matter ns Joy ; miffed, is a fubjdct of Grit  A tfa ourable prof)ect is the fuundtltion of Hope ; the reverie is the tounllation of Fear.
Pallion is greltly divcrfileed in the cale of diflerent fubjedts andl objcts.
Tlhe joy or holpe of the inteiefted and fclfifli tend to Insolence or Vanity; his grief andn fear to Dl)jcetion and 
Cowardice ;
 Cowardice; and in cafe of competition with his fellowv-creatures, to Envy, Malice, and Jealousy.
The joy and hope of the benevolent are candid and jufit; his grief or fear are mixed with satisfaCtion, or lose their effect in the ardour of his principal disposition.
A right te of the tinderfl/anding, and good intentions, being always equally in our reach, Moral Qualities may be ftldied without any variety of passion. But they who commit themselves to the diredtion of casual opinions are subjed to a variety of passion on this subject. Their joys and hopes are Self-approbation and Confidence; their griefs and fears are Shame, lndig,ation, and Renlorfe. Volition is the determination of the mind to follow an Inclination.
\'olitin founded on fentilent and inclination conflitiutes an Action.
Every 
Every Action has a motive. Every Voluntary Adion is siee. Every Free Acion is an indication of'character.
It is a privilege of tnle mind to contemplate itself; to chufe among its inclinations and sentiments; to suppress what is evil, and cultivate what is good. A  III. GENERAL INFERENCES.
I. AI'ACITY and parts refer to the Underflinding ; ardour ;ind lforce to the hlart ; both united conllitutc a natuir 1 ilperinroity cliaracter.
Vclemcnt inclin ltions are the foiuce of activity iand fte.atincts ; but extrelme piaflion of hope or fiar  or rlicf, interrupt or nmilguide our conduct. 24 1
2. The properties of mind have no analogy to those of matter.
They present exiltences of a different and opposite nature.
Divisibility is implied in every conception of matter:
Indivisibility in every sense mind has of itself.
What are called faculties of mind accordingly are not distinct parts of a complicated nature, but separate names given to different a of the fame being.
3Annihilation is unknown in the order of nature; and mind, not being fulbjcct to a dilfflution of parts, is phyfically immortal.
