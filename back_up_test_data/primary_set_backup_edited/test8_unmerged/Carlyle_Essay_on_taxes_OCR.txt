"ter, and that no rimore be demanded than what inay be supposed needful for the right Adminiftration of Public Affairs. This, however, muff be left to those Persons to whose Care and Management Affairs of this Nature are entrusted."
"Perpetual or frequent Disputes, concerning Things of this Kind, ought by all means to be avoided, especially when Subjets have no just Ground to calrin Question either the Knowledge, or Wisdom and Fidelity of their Governors ; and as Disputes upon such Points, often occurring, would greatly retard the momentous Operations of Government; nay farther, as the Expences of Government are designed for the common Behoof, any Violations of the Laws, relating to Taxes, by the Subjedts, however. little it may be the Obje& of Reflexion to the Bulk of Mankind, who attend t6 few Things beyond their narrow Circle, is in Reality more heinous than private Theft or Robbery. For this muft'of Necessity draw-after it the most dreadful.Confequenpes, if it were praatifed by any considerable Nurmbers."
"It may be further observed, that Injuries of-this Kind. are not lessened, but greatly aggravated, by their affe aing a Public. They are not only against those who govern, though they must be first alarmed, but they must in less or more asse our Fellow Citizens, who muft.be obliged to make up such Deficiencies as are occasioned by the -Frauds of rome, and be necessarily subjeaed to 'other Burdens upon this Account, besides many other Jnconveniencies and Difadvan."
"tages needless to be particularly mentioned, some of those of -a more priv;ate, and others of a more public Nature, ."
".  *Froma Frodm these and the like Coni iderations, it muff be abundantly manifest to every.thinking Person, that all Men are obliged to pay flich Takes as are appointed by their' lawful Governors. But Chriftians, above all others, are not merely bound to this, from a View of the Ends of Government, and the geieral Reason of Things, but for Confcience-fake. This is the indisputable Command of their great Master, to render unto Cafar the things owhich are Cefar  And in exa& Conformity to this Precept, the A pofle Paul orders, not only Subje to the hligher Powers in general, upon Christians, but particularly mentions this very inaranice, of giving Custom, or Vedigal and Tribute to whom they are due. For, for this Cause, says 'he, ' Pay you Tribute also: For Rulers are Ged Ministers, attending continually upon thisvery Thing, i.  to support and to fe-."
"cure the great Eneds of Government.' And every one who efleAs' must know, that the Bond of Conscience, as it has an immediate Referen'ce to the Authority of the Supreme Lawgiver,: hob is able to save and to destroy, is infinitely the ftrongeftof all others.

If these Observations are just, and indeed I cannot fee how they can be easily controverted, they miruf be very clear aidd firong Reafoins, which can juffify any Individuals, or any Order of Man, for declining Subjeton,. alng \with their Fello0w-Citizens, to any Tax .tha: is: fixed by their lawful Rulers, and from1 ihich lthey are, nobt particularly exempted.

.Notwithstanding these Observations, however, we may still be allowed to make some Remarks upon upon the. different Kinds of 'Taxes, together witfh a brief Detail .of the Tenor and Spirit of the Laws of. Sc otland, as they relate to this Sub je&.

It is observed .by the acute Author of the Spirit of Laws, that Taxes may be laid on Perlons, Lands, IMerchandizes, on any Two of these, or on all Three: A Tax on Houses or Lights, may be reckoned among the Personal ones. Now, he observes, that in taxing of Persons, it would be an unjust Proportion to conform exa&ly to that of Property. This he illuftraces by a Law which obtained amongst the Athenians. That People was divided into four Clafles : Those who drew five hundred Measures of Liquid or dry Fruit from their Estates, paid a Talent to the Public ;.
those who drew three hundred, .paid Half a Talent ; they who. had two hundred paid ten Mimne, and the FEurth ,Clats paid nothing atill.' This .Txrleaids, :weis, founded in Reafin iand Equity)
thopLugh itwas not according toithe Rule of PropQrtioSn ibecaufe,; though it did not follow the Proportion of Property, it followed its of their Wants. It was judged that every one hbad ar equAlShare of' what was neceflary for Nature, and hat,whatr was thus.neceffary ought nbt to be taxed,- That tf this succeeded the uTfefbl, which mighit taxed a but nt so muci: as the super-flootus ;nd i:'at the Largenefs of the' Taxes on what wi~ uperfluous, prevented Superfluity. If any Set of Men therefore, the Author adds, confined to iac isjuft necefrary, or only a Competency for Sufiitence, the least Disproportion here wuft be of the greatest Confeqpence;"
"It may be further observed, that as the Wealth of a Nation increases, the Expences of Governanent must .increase too, and of confequehne, Taxes must naturally increafemin a certain Proportion. But if there is any Order of Subje  hofe Income or. Salary, instead of admitting Addition (as.thar of others, either in the mers cantile YWay or by Agriculture, or by their Stations in Life commanding more Attention) muif necefTarily be diminifihing; from the very Nature of Human Affairs, such Subje&ts ought to be kept free from being included, without Necessity, in Taxes laid upon others. They must always be thus kept free, under a moderate and inild Government, if they would not fubje& them to the greatest Inconveniencies and Hardflhips."
" it is true, a Tax upon Houses and Lights is .not upon a Matter .naturally improveable; and therefore it may.be said, it may bear as hard upon others in this Refp , as upon the Clergy of Scotland. But, though this is triueinWbhe-Senfe, is fai-fe in another : For the Means Boffu~j5rting such Houses are in a mercantile Natii:, wrhile  it is i-.a flourishi-ng State, always iimprving, with -refpe& to ochers; whereas by the 'i2.aws of the Country, with refped to the Cleigyg these ..Means .mauft be al ways decreafin - ;f6'thit-even .supposing them.capable of pay ingiat prefenib their * Capacity, though for a Time they.i beirinfenfible of it, must be always miiiini1-ia-nd diminifhing too in the-famrePrpdo4'iiIthat of .others increases,. :"
" oro  4 tha of But-, ecaufe  it is generally thIght that it is unbecomiing the Ministers of cthChtril bas Scotland '- '-***- ^ ' ':'- * *

to make any Demur, or Opposition to the Payment of the Tax upon Houses and Lights, and because  it is also generally thought and lfaid, that they have no Law to support them,, it, may not be improper to take Notice, not only of their peculiar Situation as an Efrablifhment, but ofthere express Laws in their Favour, upon which they build their Security. Notwithstanding the Laws however to be afterwards mentioned, if their Situation were of the fame Kind in other RefpeAs, with that of their Fellow-Subjects, I am persuaded they would think it greatly unbecoming their Office 'and Chara&er, to decline paying. any Tax judged reasonable by the Legislature ; nay, they would chearfully pay from a Convi&ion of Duty, and to set an Example in this, as in other public and private Virtues, to their Countrymen.. They are justly sensible of their numerous Obligations to that mild and equitable Government under'
which they live: To this Government,. under a.
kind Providence,. they owe their Support as a Church, :aid their being maintained both in their Civil ~nd keligious Privileges. :I am fully perfuaded, they would reckon it at once undutiful, ungratefuila nd highly indecorous, to obftru&iany Measure they saw necessary for the Service of their Country' They, would willingly even quit. their private Rights to promote the public Utility.
My knowing these to be their Sentiments, nay the firmest Resolution of most of them, expressed both in public and in private, and indeed manifefted whenever they have had a proper Opportunity of exerting their Influence, made me think myself bouridin Juffice to set forth the Grounds of of their Defence, against being comprehendedi the Ac of Parliament which has been now of considerable Standing, and which has undergone several Chaiges.

That their Relu&ance to pay in this Instance, is not from a Spirit of Cppofition, will, I hope, be manifest to every candid and impartial Person, after confiderihg the State and Circumstances of the. Church of Scotland, from the Reformation and downward; after considering also the Laws of .their Country, supported, so far as I have ever heard, by constant uninterrupted Cuffom;
and more particularly from their present Situation, compared with that of their Fellow-Subjets. These I flhall endeavour, so far as my Knowledge reaches, to represent with all the Fairness and Simplicity of which I am capable.

In order to exhibit a just View of the Firit of these Particulars~, io more will be needful than to tread in the Steps of the Rev. Dotor Wrtfron, so far. he goes -inr his universally admired'and' ufly; celebrated History of Scotland, Afte-accountiting for the Rife and Progress of the.Reffrjnation, from' Religious, Moral,; ~nd Political Causes; and at the fame: Time aflignung the jutefte Reasons for the immenfe' Wealth and Poweriof the Popish Church; he 6bfervs that the Account given may discover the Eodundations on which so stupendous a Stru~ltuetwas ere  Among other Things he-tikes Nbtoice, that the-Nobles, accidftomed to air aative Life, difdained any of the- more fede ntary; :mployments; that where-aever Penetration anid Addresswerene ceffary, the Clergy were entruffted, because the they alone were properly qualified for such Trust Hence all the high Offices in -Civil. Governmerit devolved into their Hands.. Of Fifty-four Persons who had held the Office of Lord Chancellor, the first Office in the Kingdom both for Dignity :and Power, of these, from the earliest Ages of the Monarchy to the Death of Cardinal Beaton, Forty-three had been Ecclefiaftics : And that, Â•by the original Constitution of the Court of Sefsion, where the Lords were Supreme Judges in all Matters of Civil Right,. the President and one Half of the Senators were Churchmen, .. Is it any Wonder, after Truth had forced its Entrance into the Minds of Men, they should attempt the Deftru&ion of such a Fabric ? Is it any Wonder they should endeavour to emancipate themselves from such Slavery, by which their Souls were kept in Fetters, and their worldly Subltance entirely at the Commandi of a Set of domineering tyrannical Masters ?

Now, after this Fabric was demolished, and the Reformation established by Law; after the Riches :of. the-Popifh Church were got into other Hands, let. us fee bow the Clergy of ;the Reformation .were treated. Amongst there, there wer afew-Superintendants dispersed into diff renc Parts, who, from their superior Capacity, were. appointed-to infpe& the Life and Dotrines of the opher.Clergy; but their Jurifdi&ion extended no. farther than to Things sacred-; they.
neither: cliaimed a ,Seat in. Parliament, nor pretended any ,Right either to. the Honours or Riches of -.he forner Bishops. 
The 'The first General Afrembly, held in the Year 1560, we are told, and indeed it is but natural to presume it, bore all the Marks of an infant and unformed Society. As they were feeble and irregular, they could possess no great Authority ;
nor did they' venture to make any Decisions of much Importance. However, in the Year following, they presented the Model of their intended Policy to a Convention of Estates; and itjs observed, that however easily they might have obtained the San of that Assembly to their Rules, with refpec to Discipline and Jurifdiation, yet their Design to recover the Patrimony of the Church met with a very different Reception.
We are told, that after all the Arguments used and drawn from various Quarters, the Nobles having once seized the Prey, held it fatl; and, beftowihig upon the Proposal the Name of a devout Imaginationi, they affected to confider it as a visionary Proje&, and treated it wit he utmost Scorn. - Our Historian, before he concludes his Narrative of Tranfac~ions during the Year- 1561i, further observes, that though the Number of Proteftant Preachers was considerably encreafed, as no legal 'Provifion had' beenr yet made for them, they had only drawn a scanty and-precarious Subfiftence foinm the Benevolence of their People:
Upon this he justly remarks, that to' fuffer the Ministers of an established Church to codntinue in this State of Indigence and Dependence, was an Indecency equally reptignant to. the Principles.
of Religion and to the Maxims of fdiund Policy,, and would have justified all the Imputations of Avarice, 

Avarice, with which: the Reformation was then loaded by its Enemies. And after observing with great Diftinanefs, the various Alterations which the,Revenues of the Church had undergone dur the three Years- immediately preceding, and what Perplexities and Embarraffments were by this.. Means occasioned, he gives us the Plan which-met with Approbation and Acquiescence.
An-exac& Account of the Value of ecclesiastical Benefices, throughout the Kingdom, was appointed to be taken ; the present Incumbents were allowed ,to keep Poffefion; Two-thirds of -their whole, Revenue were reserved to their own Use, and the Remainder was annexed to the Crown ;
out of which Third the Queen undertook to assign a fufficierit Maintenance. to the Proteitant Clergy."
" Though I feel myself prompted to. transcribe the excellent Remarks of our Historian,. upon this  rt; of ScQttih Hiftqory, by which it -is eafy.to discover the mean, interested, felfifh, and.
ava~ttious .: iews of all who had got these Revenues within their Grasp, or who had this Profped;
yet, :that I may not be tedious, I shall only fart. her rpention .the Result of the Whole.

He-obfer.ves that the.- Protestant Clergy were no considerable Gainers by this new Regula  They.found it to be a more easy Matter to :kindle Zeal, than to extinguilh Avarice, Those eryMen, whom formerly they had swayedwith ah'folute Authority, were now. deaf to all their Remonfrerances. When their Stipends were.
afligned or-modified, by some of the most zealous Leaders, an fIundred Merks Scottish, or 5l. I Is.


ido  was the Allowance which.their Liberality afforded to the Generality of Ministers; to a few Three hundred Merks were granted. About Tvienty-four thousand Pounds Scottih, or 2000 appears to have been the whole Sum allotted for the Maintenance of a national Church established by Law, and esteemed throughout the Kingdom the truer Church of God.. Even this Sum waS paid with little Exadtnefs, and the Minifters'were kept in the fame Poverty and Dependence as formerly.

In 1564, .though the ecclesiastical Tranfa&ions were not considerable, the famne Representations, and no Wonder, concerning the Poverty of the Clergy, were renewed; but though they were flattered with Promises of Redress, we do not fee that it was eithei obtained, or that they had Ground to expe& it, but rather the contrary.

In 1566, two Assemblies of the Church were held. New Complaints were made, and upon, good Grounds, of the Poverty and Contempt under which the Protestant Clergy were fuffered to languilh. Penurious as the Allotmenti for their Subsistence was, they had not:received the least Part of what was due for the preceding Year. Upon this our Hliftorian juffly observes, that nothirig less than a Zeal, ready to endure and to fuffer every Thing for a good Cause, could have persuaded Men to adhere to a Church so indigent and to negleded. After assigning some of the Causes to which this was.to.be attributed, it is observed, that the Queen was obliged to prevent the just Remonftrances of the 4tfrembly, by falling on some new, Method fog the Relief of the'Church i but after all, thoigh fote Spynptons dof Liberality might have been eKpeaed in their Assignment, which was intended toi sooth the Clergy, and to filenc their Clamours ; yet both the Queen and the Nobles held the Riches of'the Church which they had seized. A fu which, at the highest Computation, can scarce be reckoned equal to 900oc.
Sterling, was deemed fufficient for the Maintenance of a whole national Church, by Men who had lately seen single Monasteries pofflffed of.
Revenues far fuperi6r in Value. It is then .remarked, to their Honour, that however much they were affeAed and alarmed at whatever threatened the reformed Religion, they bore the Grievances which affeced themselves with aftonilhing Patience.

Towards the End of the Year 1.567, we find all the Acs of the Parliament 1560, in Favour of the Protestant Religion, were publickly ratified, and; new Statutes to the fame Purpose were en ated ;  riothing chat could contribute to root out ithe.emaiais of Popery, or to encourage the Groikth ', the Reformation, was negle 
Notv~it hfianding this however, it is observable, that riefamne& prfimonious Spirit still prevailed in ths'Patlianiient as formerly. The Protestant Clergy, ;nier :many Difcouragements and ex.tremeP&overty, had for Seven Years performed all Re~if-ius Offices ia the Kingdom: The ExpedienstU. upon.- for their Subsistence, had hitherto proved ieffeaual, or were intended to be so; bus: onptwithftanding their known Indigence, cid he; warm Reinnftrances of the Affcirbly of the the Church, the Parliament did nothing more for their Relief, :than prescribe some new Regulations concerning the Payment of the Thirds of Benefices, which did not produce any considerable Change in the Situation of the Clergy.

It is again observed in 1569, thiat as the inber of the Protestant Clergy daily encreafed, the Deficiency of the Funds, set apart for their Subfiftence, became greater. Many Efforts were made towards recovering the ancient Patrimony of the Church, at least so much of it as was poffeffed by the Popish Incumbents; but though the Manner in which their Addresses and Complaints were received.by the Regent, Murray, was very dif.ferent from that to which they had been accuftomed, no effe6tual Remedy was provided; and while they fuffered intolerable Opprefliori, and groaned under extreme Poverty, fair Words and liberal Promises were all they, were able to obtain.

. . - ,. ..

. , In 1574, under the Administration. 6Morton, it is observed, that to all the Abuse of Power, with which he was charged, he added that ofhiij'ftice -towards the Church.
. The Thirds. of Benefices, out of which the Clergy received their Subsistence.
had always been slowly and irregularly: a oid to Collecors appointed by the General ;A mbly ;
and during the Civil Wars no Pay ient could be obtained in several Parts of the Kingdom.
Under Colour of redressing this Gevianice, and upon a Promise of assigning .every Minist-er a Stipend within his own Parish, the Regent extorred from the Church the Thirds to .whici' they had a Right by Law ; but the Clergy ,i if1ad of ob0taminng taining any'Advantage by this Alteration, fouind their Payments became more irregular and dilatory than ever. One Minister was commonly burdened with the Care.of four or five Parishes ;
a pitiful .Salary was allotted him, and the Regent insatiable Avarice seized on the Reft of the Fund.

In I584, such Laws were passed as totally overturned the Constitution and Discipline of the Church. The new Statutes then framed were calculated to render Churchmen as inconsiderable as they were indigent ; and as the Avarice of the Nobles had stripped them of the Wealth, the King Ambition was about to deprive them of the Power which once belonged to their Order."
"In 1585, we find the Clergy were the only Body of Men who obtained no Redress of their Grievances, by the Revolution of the preceding Year;"
"however much they had been flattered, or how much soever they might have flattered themselves, with the Promiifes that had been made them, still their Claims were sacrificed to the Interests of the Laity."
"In I587, we find all the Church Lands, formerly unalienated, which were either held by the Bilhops, who poffeffed the Benefices, or were granted to Laymen dulring Pleasure, - by an Act of the Eleventh Parliament of James VIth, annexed to the Crown, and the King impowered to apply theRerts of them to his ownUfe. TheTithes alone were reserved for the Maintenance of the Persons who served the Cure, and -the Mansionhouse, with.a few Acres of Land; viz. four, by Way of Glebe, allotted for his Residence. Though tittle little Advantage accrued to the King by this Annexation, which was owing to various Causes ;"
"the Bishops were great fufferers. But as they were odious both to Clergy and People, neither the King nor his Ministers. were any way solicitous to vance their In.terests ; nay the Profpe& of sharing in their Spoils, induced all the Parties to consent to a Step so fatal, to the Wealth and Power_ of. the dignified Clergy, -by which Means it became more easy. to introduce that Change in Church-government, which was soon afterwards effectuated."
"This Change took Place in 1592, when Prefbyterian Government was established, by A& of Parliament, and.when the several A6s in 1584 were rescinded or explained; and it is observed, that at this Time, the King, who often disgusted his Subje6ts by indulging the Popish Fadion, endeavoured to atone for -this- by Commisfions to the Presbyterian Clergy, more liberal than he himnfelf would otherwise have chofe.aito grant."
"In 1597, however, when the A& of0 general Annexation had -reduced the few surviving Bishops to Poverty and Contempt. and: when, by Means ps iome of the Clergy, Attempts were made to 'introduce Episcopacy such was .the Abhorrence of the Generality: to this -Form of Govern-ment, thaitt to .this they-.-facrificed. every Consideration of Interest or Ambition ;{they. reje both Power and -Honours with-as: much Zeal as-any of.their Order ever-courted-.them."
"From rhefe Fadts, with refpe to the Clergy of Scotland, for a considerable Number of Years,  theik their indigent Circumstances must plainly appear ;"
"this muff be manifest, whether they were under Episcopal or Presbyterian Church-government:"
"It is evident, that whatever Salaries they got, they were intended for no mere than mere Subfiftance, and that notwithstanding some additional Allowances, as Circumstances might alter, they were fill kept in a State of Poverty and great Dependence."
"Notwithstanding this Situation, however, it would appear that they either aatually did fuffer, or had been in Danger of fuffering Distress, in somewhat relative to their Livings; and therefore in this very Period some A6ts of Parliament were framed to give them Security in this refped for the future."
"This brings me to give a thort View of the Law of Scotland as it stands in relation to this Matter :"
". By A& Thirteenth Parliament James VIth, ,, Section 166, it is ordained, That all Ministers ' Stipends be in all Time coming free from all 6' Taxations or Impositions whatsoever; to the Effe& that IMinifters may bruick their Stic pends in all.Time coming.without any Trous' ble, according to their Aflignation.' And by SeAion 169, intituled, No particular, of Parliament Ihall pejudge Minifers of their Livings, it is ordained, -' That whatever, A& or Coniti.' tution of Parliamer~.tJn Time coming be made, *' in. Favour .of.any particular Person, whereby  the Provision of any Ministers Livings may * be taken away, or in any wife prejudged, diy reÂ¢ly or indirectly, in their said Provisions,  Rets, S19 3  Rents, or Profits thereof4 or any Part 6f the  fame, (hall be in all Time coming null, and of  no Avail, Force, or Effe&, unless where the ' fame in Whole or in Part shall be reduced be fore the Judge Ordinary."
"It is true, this laft-cited Adt is, in its Letter, only a Precaution againit Miniffers Provisions being hurt by any A6ts which might be made in Favour of particular Persons; but it clearly Ihews, that it is the Design of our Laws to confider Ministers Livipgs as a bare Subsistence or Maintenance which cannot admit of Diminution."
"The Law above is plain and explicit, and as it was founded in the jufteft Reason, we need not doubt, but, with whatever Difficulties Ministers had to firuggle, it was carefully observed; at least we find no Corriplaints in the subsequent Period arising from this Quarter, which is a pretty strong Presumption that there was little or no Ground for such Complaints ; and it is well known that in 1650 a Number of Ministers got their Stipends somewhat augmented."
"In 1666, a new Valuation was put upon all the Lands of Scotland, in order to Proportion the Land-tax; but no Valuation was put upon the Lands of Ministers Glebes. No other Realon can be given for this, but that the Legiflatrre was abundantly fenfibli, that Ministers Glebes, being a Part of their Provisions or Livings, were by the Law exempted from all Taxations; and the fame Law equally extends to their Houses, which are a most necessary Part of their Livings, "
"It were easy to take Notice of many other A of Parliament in the Reign of Charles the Firfr, all in the fame Spirit: Even when Episcopacy obtained it may be dblferved, that in all A6ts for collecing Taxes, the Bishops, and all other Provisions granted for pious Uses, are still exempted."
"It is also well known, that whatever A were made with refpe& to. the Church, during the Reigns of the Two Brothers, and which were inconsistent with former Confiitutions in Behoof of the PreLbyterian Interest, were repealed by King William and Queen Mary after the memorable Revolution."
"Farther still, by the Scottish Claim of Right, and by the Oath of the King and Queen, subjoined to the said Claim, the King is bound not only to maintain the Church of Scotland in its Dotrine, Discipline, and Government, but to rule the People committed to his Charge, according to the Will and Command of God revealed in Scripture, and according to the loveable Laws of the Constitutions received in this Realm rio ways repugnant to the said Word of the eterial God."
"Again, by the At for securing the Protestant Religion andPrefby cerian Church-government, at the Union of the Two Kingdoms, not only the then Queen Anie swears arid subscribes, but all her Succeffors, attheirAcceffion, are to swear and subscribe, that they -tialp not only inviolably mairncain and preserve the aforesaid Settlement of the true Proteftant Religion, with the Government, Worship, and and Difclpline ; but also the Rights and Privileges of the Church, as established by the Laws of the Kingdom in Prosecution of the Claim of Right. And by the Eighteenth Article of the Treaty of Union, it is expressly stipulated, that whatever Alterations may be made by the Parliament of Great Britain, there is to be a Difference made between the Laws concerning Public Right, Policy, and Civil Government, and those which concern Private Right ; by which latter must surely be meant, according to the Tenor of that Treaty, not only Laws relating to Individuals, but incorporated Bodies. And it is ftatuted, that the Laws which concern Public Right, Policy, arid Civil Government, may be made the fame throughout the whole United Kingdom -but that no Alteration be made in Laws which concern Private Right, except for evident Utility of the Subje within Scotland.

Thus I have deduced a short Hiffory of the State of the Clergy of the Church of Scotland, for which there are fufficient Vouchers in the Book referred to ; and this History brings us to the Time when the express Statutes were framed in their Favour.; all the other Statutes and Securities are manifestly of..the fame Tenor and Spirit."
"I thall now endeavour, as briefly and clearly as I can, to apply these Laws to. the present Question, and to the Situation of the Scottilh."
"eitablifhed Clergy in their present Circumstances."
"Whether they would, with any Decency or Pros priet  have been fubjeated to Taxes, while their Situation Situation was, as has been represented, even though no Laws had been ena in their Behoof, may be left to the candid Judgment of all who know their History. Instead of having what was proper to support them with any tolerable Degree of Decency, becoming that Station of Service in which- they were fixed, as the authorizedTeachers of Religion and Morals, the most scanty Allowances were made, and these Allowances to ill paid that their frequent Complaints cannot seem furprizing. It is evident they struggled with, and roaned under,' all the oppressive Weight of Poverty, while others were reapiig the rich Advantages of the former Incumbents ;ieven when Scotland was nder an Hierarchy, which, by-thebye, was always an Obje of general Difguff, the Biifhops were but in a forry:Situation with refpe& to their Benefices ;and 1\ence the Rules relative to theni in the Cafe--'Taxations. But the Prefbyt-rians, and the inferi6r Clery, when they were episcopal, instead of having any Thing to spare, were under an absolute Necessity of the ftri&efteFrugality and Parsimony : It may indeed be amazing with what Patience they bore their Hardships."
"As this is the true State of the Cafe, and :as the Laws of the Realm stand thus with refpe& to the Clergy, can it be thought any way unniatural that they should be alarmed, when they are in Danger of being taxed in common with others ? Though their Situation is greatly altered, in some material Refpe  for the better, since the Revolution; yet it may surely admit of a Question, ."
"Question, whether in Proportion to the Wealth of the Nation, or the Situation: of others commonly reputed of the fame Ran, their Livings are much bettered ? I imagine it can require no great Dexterity to prove that they are not. Now when this muff be felt, it needs surely to be the less furprizing they should take the Alarm when they are threatened ; this very Thing indicates their Claim of Exemption; at the fame Time there is no Doubt but they may take false Alarms even upon this Head. 1 look-.upon this to be the Cafe, both as to the Malt-tax and that upon Candles; that the Clergy should be included in there I can think no way improper, as they are neither supposed to be Makers of Malt, eyen of the Grain which is produced from their Glebes, nor of Candles. And besides, if they were exempted in such Instances, great Frauds mightr be committed by People employed in making of Malt particularly, which it is the Duty of Clergymen to guard against; and those employedina."
"the Excise might be involved in many erplexing Difficulties. Again, all Taxes upon,.1:Merchandizes they must lay their Account to.paras well as others ; besides, if any Minifterqsire2 by their Birth, Marriage, or any other Circuminft~nces."
"foreign tn their Office, providedin fuchs Qrnaments qor Superfluities of Life, as fubjeh tfliem to, any Taxes which either are, or .mayle laid upon these, it would be abfui-dto make jppofi-'"
"tion in fIuch Cafes, because is in Â·thir; own Pw.er to be without them ; and if ycloofe to have them, why should they pretend toa Right of SImmunity Immunity ? To ail stich Taxes, so far as I am acquainted, the Ministers of Scot~ind, ndtwithstanding their straitened Circurmftances, submit without Relu&ance."
"But the Tax under Consideration at present is undoubtedly to be viewed in a Light quite different. from all these laft-mentioned, or, indeed, from any other to which they have ever been in langer. of being subjected. To this then, and ~hat: is immediately conne with it, I shall confine rilyfelf in the subsequent Part of this Performance."
". The Equity of the Tax upon Houses and Windows, whatever Alterations the of ParliaÂ·Jent has undergone, or whatever Disputes may have beern about.it, I think can hardly be -.called in Qyeftion.- Though there had been fame flight Grpund for Dispute in particular ITnftances, this."
"is superseded and removed by the Authority of the.Leegiflature, who are, no Dotibt, the most proper- Judges of Matters of this. :Sort, .and Judges too constituted by all different Ranks of Men in the Nation, except the Clergy of.Scot]and, who have no Representation of their own Body there. But while all this is allowed, it must be :also allowed that it is competent, notwithstanding a general Law, from .which no Class 9f Subjedts seems to be exempted, for.every Oxder or Body of Men to plead their oiwn peculiar legal Privileges and Immunities; nay riot only muse it be allowed,that they are rightfuUy intitled to this, but .it would be a just Imputation upon them, "
"~ehri, both by particular Persons amongst their Cotemporaries, and by their Successors in Office, if they should overlook or negle such just Claim, such ireafonable Pleading, by which their Interests would be so materially affe "
"This is truly the Cafe with relation to the House and Window Tax, as it is thought to inc dlude the Miniffers of the Church of Scotland."
"It is well known that, notwithstanding the Terms of the At of Parliament, they have hitherto, at least in most Places, so far as my Intelligence exrends, declined paying the said Tax, for their Houses and Lights, though the A& does not exclude them. But this does not arise from any Oppofition to the Law, or any Reluctance to comply with the Coniftitutions of Parliament. They suppore themselves to have a broad and firm Foundation to support their Claim, as standing upon the Laws of their Country, by which certain Immunities are granted to them upon Account of their peculiar Circumfftances; and that 'of Freedom from all Taxations upon their Livings in particular. That this is the Truth of the Cafe, they think appears uncontrovertibly manifest from the Statutes already quoted. It also appears from the Manner of assigning or modifying their Stipends, and the flanding Laws and Practice with refpe& to their Houses and Glebes."
"As I have mientioned the assigning of their Stipend, it may not be improper to give a Ihort View how their Stipends are assigned by the Judges appointed for this Purpose."
"( 26 If the Clergy had a Right to the free TitheS of their several Parithes, declared by Law to be the Patrimony of the Church, or if these were assigned to them, even before these Tithes are fold or valued, this would be a pretty good Provision. But this is far from being the Fa&. For it is only out of there free Tithes they have their Stipend assigned or modifyed, at the Difcretion of the Judges. To affertain thefe' Tithes, they are made a Fifth Part of the payable Rent, with certain DeduCtions in particular Cafes. Thus, fuppoling the Rent of a Parish to be ioool. and to be fixed at this Rent upon a Suit for a Stipend to the Minister, the Tithe here is zoo . If this were given to the Clergyman serving the Cure;, it would be a grand Allowance, and an Allowance against which there could be no legal Obje&ion by the Proprietors of Land. But this is far from being the Cafe. For it is only out of this .200 1 after certain Allowances are made, that the Stipend is assigned. And if 1000o. Pounds Scottish, or 8 3. 6  8d. Sterling, is given, it is generally reckoned a great Allowance. That this is the Fa&, I am persuaded will appear from the Decrees of Modification and Locality which have been granted since the Revolution. Indeed, in Parishes Where the yearly payable Rent may be double to.the Sum mentioned, there may not be nigh so much free Tithes, owing to Valuations or Sales of pretty old Standing: And by our Laws, as they stand, the Tithes must be computed according to the Rent of the Lands as it stood at the Time of such Yaluations. I have only given a Ihort a lhort Sketch of this (Point, as it would 6e enIdless to enter into the Mirutise of it; only it plainly appears, that by our very Laws, while the Proprietors of Lands may be increasing the Value of their ,Estates to a very great Height, the Allowance to the Minister can never exceed a certain Suin.

But whatever is assigned them, whether it be more or less, according to the different Circumitances of their Parishes, it is manifest from the known Laws of Scotland, and even from the -uniform Language of the Decrees of the Judges, that it is given them as a necessary Provision for their 'Sdbfiftence, and no more than what is accouinted .needful for this Purpose. Now, as it is only out of this Provision they can be supposed capable of paying Taxes at any Rate, mufftit not be extrei3ely hard toifubje& them to a Tax, where, without any Difficulty, they can be diftinguiihed from all other Subjeas? It is justly observed by the Author of the Spirit of Laws formerly quoted, that in general where Taxes are not exorbitant, and where People continue to have Plenty of Necdraries, even particular A of Injullice can do nro larm. If on the contrary People are permitted to enjoy only just what is neceflary for Subsistence, the least Disproportion will be of the greateft'Confequence. If some Subjects do not pay enough, the Mischief is not so great; their Convenience and Ease turns always to public Advantage. But if some private People pay too much-'; by Which he means too much in Proportion to their Circumstances, their Ruin rePD  dounds dounds to the public Detriment. If the Governmentproportibns itsFortune to that of Individuals, the Ease and Conveniency of the latter will fooa make its Fortune rife. The Whole depends upon a critical Moment. Shall the State begin by impoverishing the Subje&ts to eprich itself? Or, had it not better wait to be enriched by its wealthy Subjets ? These Remarks, I am persuaded, are justly applicable to the present Point. Is it not manifest, upon the mott cursory Infpeaion into the State and Circumstances of the Church of Scotland, from the Reformation downward, that her Clergy in general could never have been fubje to any public Burdens without the greatest Hardships bordering upon Oppression?"
"And surely if it was thus in former Periods, when the Livings of Ministers, all Things taken into the Accournt, bore a greater Proportion to the State of others, generally reckoned of mtiuch the fame Rank: .ri Life, it must be much mniore so now, when this Proportion is greatly altered to their Disadvantage.."
"To.demonftrate this can require no .great Depthiinlpolitical Arithmetic. In this Maitter, it is only needful to call to Mind some of the wellknown, Maxims concerning Money, whiether real or artificial, Is it not obvious that the real Value of Gdoldajd Silver, and other Metals, and corfeque~nty of Coins, is diminilhed in Proportion to theixjPlenty, and augmented in Proportion to their Scacity ? From which it follows, that thovgh:thipfame Names may be given to certain cuantitipes ofhefe Metals, minted after a certaiq Manner Â•"
"Manner, it by no means follows, that the Value is the fame at one Time as at another ; or that one can purchase the fameNeceffariesor Conveniencies of Life with any given Quantity at all Times. In Thort, though the Value of other Things isin some .Refpeas liable, only making Allowances for the Difference of Times and Seasons, the Value of Money, whatever Names may be affixed to certain Pieces, is next to nominal. Such Ministers therefore, who have their Stipend paid in Money, when Money is plenty, and consequently cheap, must of Neceflity at any Rate be reduced to the greatest Inconveniencies; pay, if they have not something else to depend upon than their bare SLivings, they must fuffer the greatest Distress ;"
"and this Distress, either greater or leTs, from thefe
Parts of. the Country where they have their Refidence. This is what every one must be con.
vinced of at first Glance, Such indeed whose Saleries are paid in Grain, either wholly or in Part, though this is greatly less preearious, and consequently allowed to be more fit for Men in such Offices, as a continued Support in the fame Station. with refpe& to their Neighbours; yet when the Quantities are small it can make no such Difference, especially making Allowances for Seafois,-as to fubje& them to any public Burden where it can be avoided. That this is the Cafe in Scotland is manifest from the general Run of the Quantities deemed necessary as a Provilion for the Families of Clergymen, in Things which po Family can be without, and any Superplus that may be supposed, is to furnilh with other Necessaries NecefiTares or simple Conveniencies. And it is obvious, that Ministers in Scotland, who have no more than their Stipend, even though we should suppose it to be amoogft the largest, and the moist pundtualy paid, can,in the present State of Things, aim at nothing higher.

I doubt not, but many will be greatly astonished, when they hear-of the small Saleries granted to the Clergy soon after the Reformation. But their Aftoriiihment may perhaps be considerably abated, when they confider of what high Value Money was at that Time and long after, because of its Scarcity. I remember it is narrated in the Preface to Kriox History, that about ihat Period when there was agreat Dearth approaching to a Famine, every thing rofe' so high, that an Ox fit lor the Plough could not be purchased under ten Pounds Scottish, or sixteen Shillings and eight Pence, nor a fat' Sheep under half a Crown, and all other Things in Proportion. When this was he Cafe, in such Circumstances, we may easily discern 'how fcar&ceMoney was, and that confeqiiehtly a very little must have borne a high Value, greatly difproportioned to what it has borne for a long Timne past. Though I dare not affirm it, I can have little Hesitation to think, their hundred Mnlerks Scottish then, were fully as good, if.not preferable to a thousand Merks now.

Waving however any Computations of this Sort, is:it not manifeft-that every Thing for the Ufeof Families, requires a great deal more Montey to be paid for it now, than it did not many Years ago ?



ago? From this, is it not also manifest, that chiefly, through the vast Extent of Commerce, more Money is in the Kingdom now than formerly ? This enables monied Men to give vastly more for Land, and to lay out more upon their Lands in the Way of Improvement. Through the great 'Increafe of Money, and this Money always circulating (for without this it were as good in the Mines) the Farmer is enabled to give, not a higher Rent, but more Money for what he poffeffes than before. This is a Point which might admit of large Illuifration, by running through all the Ranks of Life.

Now, is it not as clear as any thing of this Kind can be, that the Clergy of the established Church.
of Scotland, considered as such, are secluded, both by the standing Laws of Church and State, from numerous Advantages which others are capable of enjoying.? If this could be disputed, I might mention both A of Parliament and A of the General Assembly to make this Matter evident. Nor is this indeed any just Ground of Complaint, as it is taken for granted by these Laws, and by the whole Spirit of our Ecclefiaftical Constitution, that they are to give themselves wholly up to the Duties of their Fun&ion, and be as little as possible entangled with the civil and secular Interests of the World. , Only. it is a Maxim, not only Apoftolical, but founded in common Sense, and in all just Notions of Policy, that as they who serve at the Altar fhouldlive by the Altar, the Livings of the Clergy ought to bear some suitable Proportion to the State of the Country Country in which they officiate in its feviral Variations. Whether this is the Cafe at present, may, without the least Hesitation, be submitted to the impartial World to judge.

Not to go father back, let us only look to the State of Scotland at the Revolution, or at the Time of the Unioni or even twenty or thirty Yeats from the present Time, and let us compare their Livings then with what they are now, though no Alteration be made as to their Stipend, whether paid in Money or Victual, or partly in both;
and I apptehend it will appear at first Glance, that this Matter can hardly bear a Question. I am fully persuaded that twenty or thirty Years ago any given Sum would have purchased neaf double, and in some Places much more, than what the fame Money can do at present.

In speaking upon this Point, I confine inmy Ideas intirely to those which are suggested by Law, which is the ainly fair Way of reasoning and judging in Cafes of this Nature. However comsortable and happy in their worldly Situation some Ministers may be upon account of foreign and adventitious Circumstances, is a Question of a different Kind; a Question with which the Merits of this Cause has no concern; nor can it reasonably be admitted in pleading where the Right of the Cafe depends solely upon Law or legal Privilege. Ministers in such comfortable Circumftances may perhaps discover no Aversion to be includedin this, more than in other public Burdens, or Taxes upon the Superfluities, the Ornaments and Conveniencies of Life but this can be no Rule I 33 1 Rule with, refpe& either to the Church in general, or the great Bulk of Clergymen whose Circumstances are extremely different, and who have nothing but their Stipend to support.
them.

As the Chutrch of Scotland has none of their own Body to plead and to support .her Laws and Rights in Parliament, can it be any wonder that these Laws and Rights, peculiar to themselves, though ouice well known, should through Time be forgotten ? Is it any Wonder that the Scotilh Members of Parliament, supposing them ever to well disposed to promote the Interests of the Clergy, and willing to defend their Rights, lhould omit their Duty in this Refpe&, through .not knowing these Rights, diftinaly, especially as many Ministers may notperhaps know them themselves ? Even the belt employed Lawyers, and who have the most extensive Knowledge of the Laws, do rnot rerttember those Laws which.relate to every particular Cafe upon which they are consulted, until they are put in Mind of them.
And can it be any Surprize that this should be the Cafe here, when there never was Occalion, until of late, to look into the Laws of the Country, as they relate to the Clergy with refpe& to. their Livings. My mentioning this, fuggelts, by-the-bye, a ftrongArgument ofitfelf, for the Justice, the Equity, and Propriety of their Claim of Exemption.
They are able to plead, not only the Laws of their Country, and these Laws declared to be unalterable by the Treaty of Union , noc only the Terms in I 34 in which their Livings are assigned them, as only a necessary Provision for their Support but their:
Immunity from all' axes of this Nature for Time immemorial. And this Argument is farther fortified by the Exemption of-their' Glebes from the Land Tax, notwithstanding the general; Terms of the Law in this. Matter. The Custom also with relation to Manfes in Royal Burghs,. is.
well known ; namely,: that these Houses are, at.
least the Miniffter is, exempted from paying any Cess.

From these and the like Confidrations, found"
"ed upon the Laws of Scotland, and the Circumfitances of the Church .and Clergy, it cannever be supposed to be the In-tention of theLegifature to bring them into a Sctae ofDiftrefs."
"They, as an Establishment, aie upon a quite different Footing from the Church 'of England."
"Their Livings are assigned and allocated to them in a very different Manner. TheCergy, where their Stipend .is given out of the: Tithes, have only so .much out of such as,,are free, as. the, Judges, appointed for that Ptirppfe, deem ne-.
ceffary, according -to the Difference ofPariflies and other Circumstances; a small Portion of, the Land, as a Help to maintain their Fatmilies, and such Houses as may be judged competent for'
their Lodging,, planned and built at the commorn Expence of the Proprietors of Land. From the "
"very Phraseology of the Decrees of Modification and Locality, these are all supposed to be freeofrom public Burdens, even though they had, po explicit Laws in' their Favour 3 and when both , 3:5 .both hese are strengthened by confiant Custom, one can hardly think but the Argument should be conclusive, If there and the like Arguments plead fo their 'Immunity'from paying Arrears for a considerable Time palt, they surely plead strongly too for 'their not being ifubjeaed for the future, while their Circumstances continue as they have been represented, and that without either Exaggeration, ' or the least Design 'to exaggerate. I can have no ,doubt to assert, that the Clergy of Scotland both 'profefs, and really feel, the firi&teft Attachment :to One of the 'beft of Kings, and to our happy ,Constitution ' for-which, if properly called to it, ;they would be willing to rifque their All. But while they'have the-higleft 'Regard to the most *exccellent Governmtent, and the mildest Adminifitration, to which they have >been so much in-debted, they would still be wanting in that Justice they owe to themselves, to the Laws of 'their Country 'ftanding unrepealed, and to their 'Succeffors in Office, if they should tamely yield .up any of these legal Privileges with which they are veiled. Should 'they give up these, without :urging what they haveto fay in their own Defence, whom would they have to blame ? Not our Legislature, which in !Questions ,of this Nature may not be fufficiently informed of their peculiar Privileges. Not even the Scotch Memrbers of JParliament, unless .they be supposed to carry in .their Memories all the Afts of the Parliament of Scotland, and Regulations and Cufftoms in consequence of them, or founded upon them:

E2 Not .Not the Gentlemen of the Country, whatever diminutive Ideas many of them may entertain of eClergy in general. They would in this Cafe have themselves to blarme, and thermfelves alone, for not asserting and vindicating, in a legal Manner, their own Rights, which are founde4 on their particular Situation, and in the Laws of their Country. They may in this Cafe hope to he crowned with Success, when they strive lawfully.

It would be to discover Suspicions of themselves, as well as of their Claim, for the Clergy of Scotland to imagine, that our gracious Sovereign, or the supreme Judicature of the Nation, would find Fault with them for urging in a becoming Manner, and with a decent Freedom, what they deem to be their just Rights and their legal Privileges-While every Thing in the British Conftirution -is legal; the Prerogatives of the Crown, and the Privileges of the Subject; and thefre Privileges diversified according to di.ffererit Circumstances, they at any Rate only a5t the Part of other Subjets, by pleading in the Spirit of Meekness, Gentleness, and Moderation, there their peculiar Ones, and the Laws upon which they are founded. If others, vested with their Office and. Charater, have not the fame or the like Arguments to urge for themselves, the Clergy of Scotland are not to be blamed for this : And besides, the Laws with refpe& to the Clergy, in South andNorth-Britain, are evidently founded in quite different Principles. The Scotch Clergy are hopeful, while Â·they do not grudge their Brethren in England their manifold Advantages of 1 37 3 of a different Sort, they have no Ground to be jealous of their looking upon them with an envious Eye.

But even abflra from all these Confide;

rations, which they look upon to be their great Bulwark, not only as Ministers upon such an Establishment, but as SubjeCts of a legal Government, have they not the best Reasons to expose to the View of the Public their present Circumstances ? Can it be already forgotten, that not very long since the Church of Scotland made Application to Parliament for augmenting their Livings, according to the different Situation of Parishes, and particularly for enlarging the Minimum of their Stipends, besides some other Emendations, which were looked upon as needful for their Relief in certain Cafes, and to free them from unnecessary Charges in Initances of Law Suits ? Did it not then appear, from the Reports of Ministers, and the Records of the Commiflion for. Plantation of Churches, that the Fats stood as follows? Of Eight hundred and Thirty-three Benefices, feparatiog what is allowed for. Communion-Elements, there is one under 25 . Three above 251. and not higher than 30ol. Twelve above 30o . and not higherthan 35. Twentyfive above 35 1. and not higher than 4o1. One hundred and Six above 401. and not higher than 45 1. One hundred and Twenty-fix above45L. and not higher than 50 1. Eighty-four above 501. and not higher than 551. One hundred and Nineteen above 551. ancdnot higher than 6o 1.

But they are Fatas, which, whatever Attenition may be paid to them, fully and clearly indicate the growing Distresses, to which Clergymen, as such, must be reduced, unless something is done in their Favour. If the Argument rises."
"higher than was originally intended in this Essay, the Writer is not to blame for it, as he has only:"
"mentioned the Circumstances as they truly stand;."
"and if these Circumstances strongly plead for bettering the Livings of the Ministers of. Scot'"
"land, they certainly plead more strongly .for not diminishing them by Taxes. Besides, ,I always., fay Clergymen, as such, because it would be un-."

It may be fairly avowed, that the Circumftances, withrefpe&tto Living, are daily upon the Increase; and when this is the Cafe, it furniihes, out another strong Argument for. Exemption from the threatened Burden. Is it not manifest that that exa6ting it of Ministers would make matny conliderably worse, and such too who :could least bear it, as it might happen that their Houses, by Reason of the Plan fixed upon by the Landholders in, their Parishes, are furrifhed with.a greater Number of Windows than those of others who might be better able to pay. Nay, it may be affirmed, that in many Places of Scotland paying this Tax would be a considerable yearly Rent."
"I acknowledge, an Argument drawn from Poverty has nothing graceful in it. Coram Rege."

"This in general is a just Maxim."
"But why should the Clergy be ashamed to owi their Poverty now, more than some Years ago,."

". I have only said what has occurred tomyfelf upon this Article. Without pretending to .any -iead for Legislation, .I can easily .discern the Reasons for the .Speciality-in the Sco.tilh A of Parliament: .I can also discern. that, they muff have appeared highly reasonable; and every Thing of a contrary Aspect highly unreasonable, both at the Time of the Revolution and of the Union."
"Nay, I can farcher fee why the Clergy of Scotland have for so long Time been concluded as exempted from Taxes, .without any express Clauses in their Favour in other Aats of Parliament.. 1 can fuirther discern the Impropriety of struggling a Point of this Nature with refpe& to other Taxes, such as the Malt-Tax; because this might involve those concerned in levying such Taxes, as, well as the Makers of Malt,, in various Difficulties, besides exposing such Persons to manifold Temptations.. These, Clergymen from their Office and Charader, should be disposed,. even above all others, to prevent.,.Bur here none of these Circumfancescan be pleaded.. There can be nio Difficulty in distinguishing the Minifter House, .from all other Houses in the several Parishes .ineither the Surveyors nor others! can be under .the least Temptation to Fraud, or Qrthr coniequential Instances .of Vice."
". And perhaps after all it may not be unworthy of Consideration, whether Glergymens Houses ought not to. be viewed in the Light of public Qnes, and4 come under that particular Denomina' \ ' Uiun tiorl; They areHoufes appointed by Law, aid indeed many- Statutes there are about them.
They are to be fixed in every Parish for the Residence of the.Perfon who serves the Cure.
They are planned and built, as has been said before, at the common Expence of the Proprietors of Land. They have generally as many or as few Windows, and. there of as different Dimensions, is either the Vanity, or, if you please, Generosity or Parsimony of the Land-holders prompt them to determine. Betides, they are often so far from being proportioned to the Stipend assigned to the Minister, that a Minister with a small Stipend'
Ihall have a large House, and one with a much .

larger Stipend shall have a small House, Would it not then be a great Hard ship for the Poffeffors to pay Taxes, all other Circumstances considered, for Houses planned and built in the Manner mentioned?

For my own Part, I know not whether these or the like Considerations bave been urged ornot :
If they have been urged, and yet not listened to or regarded, there is no Help for such Misfortune.
It no Doubt becomes the Clergy of Scotland to submit with Patience to rhi_, and even to greater Hardships. At the fame Time it is their Duty to acknowledge, with Hearts warmed with Gratitude, the Prote&ion and Countenance of that benign and auspicious Government, to which they have stood, and still sand indebted for riumerous diftinguilhing Advantages. If these, or other Considerations of the fame Kind, have not been urged, as I am strongly suspicious they have not; because I have never observed the Argument to be rightly understood by those who think they ought not to be exempted from Payment; and because of the Surprize which I have often heard expressed, that the Clergy of the Church of Scotland should pretend to Exemption more than the Clergy of England. For these Reasons, as I am greatly suspicious they have not been urged, I cannot hesitate in declaring my Opinion, that they ought to be urged, or other additional Reasons which may be perhaps itronger than those now advanced. .And I can hardly doubt, but it (hall be clearly discerned by all who have the Management of Matters of this Kind, whether in South or North-Briton, that the Plea of the Scotifh. Clergy is far from being merely chimerical, or even without such Foundation as they may hope to stand secure. Nay, it is possible their Eyes may be opened to fee somewhat more than the Equity of the present Claidi, which can never be accused of Immodesty. Toconclude; I am fully of the Mind, that not only the Laws of the Realm, together with immemorial Custom equivalent to Law, and pre.
fumed to be built upon Law where there is no Presumption to the contrary, but the Peculiarities relative to the Livings of the Clergy of Scotland-these, with the other Circumstances which have been taken Notice of, make me persuade myself, that if they are fully represented, and fairly canvaifed, 

1 vaffed, they have good Ground so expeft to be kept - in the fame Situation with refpe& to the Tax' upon. Houses and Lights, as they have hihert  been.;. and consequently freed not only frb Trouble, but what must in many particular Inftraces.be extremely grievous and diftreling, "
