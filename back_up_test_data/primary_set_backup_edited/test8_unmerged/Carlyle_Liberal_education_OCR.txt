"But as, nctwitlhfanding all tlhei argu ments, there are flill Ibme who look back for an example to the firfi age. hecdiefs of the different rfares of the church, and of the world; and as uneducated pret:ndcrs A a are are too apt to catch the vulgar, I propose in this discourse, with the blesing of God, to hsew the usefulness and necessity of a liberal education for clergymen ; which if 1 am able to do, I shall illustrate one of the primary objects of this most beneficent and liberal inflitution. I fliall then, I. Endeavour briefly to draw the out line of that education which befits a clergyman; or flhew, wherein a liberal education may be supposed to consist."
"II. I shall endeavour to shew the great advantages of such an educacion."
"II. I fliall make application of the sub jc to this Society; who I hope will forgive me, if, emboldened by the duty they have afligned me, and presuming too much perhaps on my age and experience, I fiall offer inftrution to their enllightned minds."
"I. I am to point out wherein a liberal education may be said to consist; or draw the the outlines of that plan of inftrucltion that befits a clergyman."
"It has often of late been the subjeC of doubt, whether or not the time that is spent in early youth, with so much labour and pains, to acquire the knowledge of the dead languages, is necessary in modern times, or is ever repaid by any equivalent advantages. But however plausible the arguments may be, against this unneceffary waste of time as it is called, in some other lines of life, yet they cannot poffibly be applied with justice to any of the learned profeflions, especially to that of the divine: For the sacred books having been written in these languages, it would be unpardonable ignorance in the candidate for our profefllon, to be unacquainted with them, or to be unable to study all that is comprehended in the wide compass of biblical knowledge. Or how are the sublime beauties of Scripture, from whence so much internal evidence is derived, and which is the sacred armou ry ry for the weapons of our warfare, to be felt or underflood, if the student is ignorant ol or a mere novice in, the languages in which they are written ! To be firmly eftabliflied himself in the belief of the crptures, and to be able to communicate the foundations of that belief, in a clear and convincing manner ; and still more, to have a decided taste for those lofty firains of the sublime and the pathetic, which captivate the foul of man, and make his bowels to yearn within him, the Chrif-ian teacher surely ought to be a mafter of the original languages."
"Add to this, that the classics in two of the ancient tongues, have been handed down to us, with the contenting voice of every age, as the mofi perfect models of composition; as the highefl efforts of human genius; as exhibiting examples of good sense and taste; and even such glowing pictures of virtue, as are congenial to the young and feeling mind, and make a more lasting irnpielion, than can be clone by by formal rules. No wonder then that clafical learning fliould be conrfdered as an essential branch of a liberal educat;. "
"So far flould we be fi-om laying afidc the antients for tlhe moderns, and abridging the labour of a learned education, that if there is any defect to be correctedl in ours, it is that the youth are hurried too Lilt into science, before they have had time or maturity enough, to acquire perf:el 11 ill in thl;fe languages, or to imbibe part of that spirit, to catch fonie portion of that celcftial fire of benius, with lichl thefc fupcrior writings are composeld."
"And if our pupil ought to be a mafrer of the claflics, it follows of course, that he mufr be conversant in criticifin and rhetoric, and every branch of the belles lettres, that he ay fully co pre: end the beauty and lublimity of anticnt conpofition. I-ere it must be obfirsved tlhat our vernacular tongue mufu not be negleted."
"It was perhaps, by means of their close attention to the study of their own lan guagcs, guages, that the Greeks and Romans attained to that degree of perfection in them, which has made their writings of all kinds the admiration and the models of succeeding ages. We in particular, who speak and write a provincial dialedc of the national tongue, that not long ago was hardly understood in the capital, had much need to apply with the utmost diligence in early youth to acquire the pure idiom of that language in which we speak and write; because, in more advanced years. it will not only be a more difficult acquisition, but may retain an inaccuracy, or a stiffness at least, which are the marks of imperfection."
"When this branch of erudition is finifil  or towards its conclusion, it will be proper to initiate our student in logic and the elements of mathematics, as not only neceffary to exercise his mind in close reasoning, and thereby to fhrengthen and improve his faculties, but to enable him to comprehend the sublime science of natural philosophy in all its parts, when it is opened ripened up to his admiring mind: and cf;eciay those which in tracing the wonderful effects of power, wisdom and goodness in the diversified fTiame of nature, lead direily with the mnoic lendid demonfiration to the firit Cauie, that supreme Intelligence which created and prelides over tlhe whole."
"Thus prepared, with his mind expand to explore the works of God, our pupil may venture to look within htlilelf; to fludy the fcicnce of mind or spirit; to invefligate the inteilectual, the ;iive, and moral powers of man, the molt mytlcrious and diflicult of all the sciences; that withl faculties enlarged, and more infallible lagacity, he may be able to search to the bottom the principles of ethics and politics, as they are dif;tlayed with iuch boundless divcrfity, in the hiIfory of man either as an individual or in society."
"And now, well able to diflinguifh between truth and faliehood, between cer tainty tainty and doubt, and to mark the line that divides their boundaries, he may venture to explore the sublime regions of Theology, to trace what is comprehensible by finite, in infinite Mind; to perceive the connection between the visible and invisible world; to deduce natural and revealed religion from the fame source; and, in the hiflory of man and his moral agency in this life, to descry his future destiny in the next."
"And here commences our student most arduous tafki, for which all the other parts of his education are chiefly preparatory; I mean the study of Theological Learning."
"To this he must for several years of his maturer age, devote his molt serious attention and assiduous labour; for it is from the inftruc'ion he shall receive, and the knowledge he shall acquire, in this important course, that he can be properly furnished for the defence of revealed religion, and for the refutation of sceptical cavils: that he can become thoroughly ma fter fter of the history and doCtrines of the Reformation, and be able to establish the great principles of Christian faith, againfl all heretical opinions. ltowfoever great a proficient our pupil may be in classical knowledge, or however much an adept in philosophy, yet, if he is deficient in theological erudition, he will fall short of what is expected in his profession, his proper work will be always laborious to him, and a degree of llightnefs will be attached to his character as a divine, which may derogate from his usefulness. But on this part of education, though in itself so important, I need not enlarge, as its necefity is so obvious and inconteftible; but shall proceed to mention others that may be overlooked."
"Of these let me recommend as a branch of politics, the constitution and laws of his country, as a most necefary part of his fludy. It were well too, if to the general knowledge of human nature, our pupil could add some kl?,noleode of the world; that which terminates in felfifhnefs and cunning, nor that which may qualify him to be a ringlea(ler in the vices of the age, but that kno!ledge of the world wrhich is so needful to induce politeness of behaviour, and thole agreeable manners, which taking rife in benevolence and charity, mufL nevcrthe!if receive their form fr-om the practice of iociety, fiomi converIation and habits the elegant and :cfined."
"In ancient phraseology, the scholar and the ,gentlelnlan were fy'noniiious terms, an were confidered as inflparalle. In nodccrn language, this has fbmctilmes bcen unfortunately changed, for Lnalme of gentleman las IcenC as nmuci a terml of obloquy amongl; the rl.vc as that of pedant 1 been of contempt among the gay; by .which means the bad qualities only of eachI, have been generally annexed to the characers, and a gentleman by the multitude has too often been underiood to be -menrely a pcri illivterat, idle, and mif cll.evous, \ '3 )"
"chievous; and a pedant acknowledged to be learned, and heavy, and rude. This Li charaecr on account of a variety of circumstances was long ascribed to the clergy of this church, and they were then not unjustly afraid of the appellation of gentlemen, as with the unthinking vulgar of all ranks, that implied licentious man elers."
"It is high time to change this perversion of words and ideas ; and the change is bcgun: for an accomplilhed gentleman is now underflood to mean evcry thing praifc-worthy in a characecr, to comprehernd all the qualities that attracd the eflecrl, or attach the afTeEions of mankind, learning and virtue, agreeable talcnts and poii!ice:"
"manners. And the opinion of .lC public, no longer reflrainetd by Gothic nanners and the exclusive cl:imns of the iipicrior orders, but equal and free as their laws, is 'now ready to give every man his due, in proportion to :' val:eC oj his talents and accomplishments."

"To make the world of easier access to our fludent than it formerly was, the virtues and vices have resumed their places again, after having been long deranged by the disorderly hands of superstition and cnthufiafm. It is no longer a crime to be well-bred, nor ridiculous to be learned."
"The amusements of the gay are not held to be profane, nor the fludies of the grave to be absurd or useless. The muses have replaced the graces in their train, and recovered their wonted attractions. But if hypocrisy has pulled off her disguise, and the catalogue of fins extends no farther now than to things prohibited by the law and the gospel, surely the more liberty the manners of the age allows our fludent in things lawful or indifferent, so much less temptation has he to overleap the bounds of 'wJhat is rbiddenz, and follow fashionable dissipation; so much the stronger inducemment, to preserve that professional decorum which becomes his dignity. But why should I dwell longer on this imperted delineation ? The luminous method of intlruction inf-rution, prescribed in our universities, and executed with so much honour and success, is a far better guide than any imperfect sketch of mine can be. What I mean to inculcate is this, That the line of education for clergymen, cannot be too extensive or liberal, and that of the three learned professions, ours can least admit of a limited or narrow fyflem of inftruction."
"The profession of the law, though on many accounts the leading profession in this country, is not necessarily conversant in any but outward things, the property of man, and the restraints of law on his actions. The study of the law and its accessories, is therefore all that is necefiary in this laborious profession. he fame thing may be said of the medical art, whose object is the bodies of men. But the bufiness of those of the clerical profeflion, is with the mind of man, and therefore their preparatory knowledge is of the most boundless extent, embracing the whole circle of science, .iience, all the objecs and operations of intelle2c, and all the objects and motions of the will and the paflions; for each and every one of them, ay occasionally serve as useful inflruments in the Chri/lian orator vocation; which is, by enlightning the minds, and purifying the paflions of men, to make them wife and virtuous and happy.  are the light of the worlJi Add to this, that the operations and es fcds of the two other profefions are at ian end and cease forever, rwhen the tenure of all earthly goods is cancelled by the hand of death, and when the body is laid in the grave; but those of the Christian philofbpher, while they tend to make the rich man haplpy b7c'nevolence, and the poor serene and contenltd tvith hope, and the sick and .fflictcl patient -nnmarnanin-tius through faith, even in this life, provide for them all in the life to come, zwhat 'ye has not feel;, nor ea eard, wvhat it hath not entered into the lheart of mian to conceive,."

"But I come Iln In the second place to point out the great advantages of such an education; and here i shall be confined to three particulars, as it refpeds a clergyman personal characler; as it refpeds his fitness for the office; as it may prove ornamental to the society."
"_si, I shall confider the advantage of a liberal education,as it reipeds a clergyman personal character."
"Mankind may be divided into the edu cated and uneducated, learned and ignorant, wife and foolifil; and it is obvious to which division the preference must be given. For though it does not neceflarily follow, that all the learned are wife, and all the ignorant foolifhl; yet, in the opinion of mankind, there is a marked fiperiority attached to theformer. 'Tej7all be as Gods, said Satan to our firit parents, 7,when7 he temptedthem to ta/le of the tree of knowledge. Riches and poverty, the moit obvious of all divisions, mark the lines of powerC power and of dependance; but for refpe&"
"and authority in all the important affairs of life, for advice in perplexity, for counfel in danger, for every office of weight and confidc' in human society, the advantages of a liberal education have ever been acknowledged. /[ hen the city is befieged, the izvfe man is rev oted to, even though he Jhould be psor. Eccles."
"In the common intercourse of life, the educated man must every moment feel the superiority he polfeiTes, not in the outward marks of respect, which are frequently denied him, but in the ascendant he perceivcs he has over the minds of other men, the mot flattering of all the qualities and talents a man can pollefs ; becaufl it is derived fromn no foreign circumilance, but solely from peroinal merit; because it is the homage which nature has prefcribed the weak in intellect shall pay to the strong. It has sometimes been questioned whether or not the mofl consummate general, the hero in war, in common opi nion nion the most splendid of all characters, ought to be accounted of talents superior to the philosopher who enlightens the world ? Of their comparative usefulness to mankind there has been no doubt: Could the queflion be solved by the temper and conduct of kings and heroes themselves, it would be decided in favour of the latter; for we shall find that they have not always been satisfied with the fulness of their own qualities and glory, but have often languished on their thrones, for that kind of celebrity which belongs to the works of fages and philosophers. Not contented that their actions were to fill the hi/foric page, and their renown to animate the poet lays, they have foinetimes firove, with vain emulation, to excel them in their several arts."
"But not only in public opinion, but in his own felf-government, is that strength of character which is derived from a liberal education of the greatest advantage to a minister of this church.  it is in his 2 conscious conscious superiority of wifdorn and vir, tue, that he is able to maintain his dignity, in that nice and difficult situation in which he is placed. To mix daily with the people, and yet be uninfeted with their manners; to hold the middle course, between the aufRerity that difgufls, and the facility that breeds contempt; to have all the nice feelings of an elegant and enlightned mind, and yet to bear the shocks to which it is liable, and be denied moit of the gratifications for which it creates a taste. To be contfantly firiving with narrow circumstances in the midlt of a commercial slate without hope of improving them, and yet to preserve equanimity, and maintain a dignity of conduC, sufficient to draw the respect that is due to his ftation:-Thefe are parts of that arduous undertaking, which ministers engage in, when they enter into this church ; which never could be sustained, but for that elevation of mind and force of character, which is acquired by a liberal education."
" it is  it is by this means that he is felf-fatisfied, even in the midst of the most trying circumftances that can befal him; that reposing himself on the enjoyments of a philofophic mind, he can calmly bear the neglet, or even the contumely of the world;"
"and, retiring to contemplation and solitude, can content himself with the consolations of learning, the exercises of piety, and the duties of his charge."
"A 2d advantage arising from the liberal education of clergymen, is, that it fits them for their profession."
"Personal merit in some degree qualifies a man for every thing; and he who brings a strenuous, an elevated, and enlarged mind into any profession, is most likely to shine in it. Yet there is a certain meetnefs and fitness of talents and profeflions for each other, without which excellency cannot be attained."
"It was taught by the ancients that the good good and virtuous man alone was qualisied to fline as an orator in their public afifenblies. How much more clearly must it be understood, that he who is to teach virtue to others, mufl hinmfelf be eminently virtuous; thathe who is to inftrud mankind in knowledge, must himnfelf be fully inftru ded ? Both are the fruits of a liberal education; and both are necefliry in the clerical profession. For though proof susficient to convince the hearers of any truth may be at the command of the intelligent;"
"yet the power of asseting the passions of men, and of conveying irrefiflable and lasting impressions of morality to their minds, belongs only to him, who to superior knowledge, joins the virtues of ths heart. And though learning and virtue are not infeparable companions, yet who so likely to acquire that divine quality, or to improve it, when already bestowed by thefframerof the human foul, as the man who having trod the whole circle of science, with enlarged views, has discovered what is good and ihat is evil; what we ought to seek after, after, and to lihun; how contemptible alloutward things are; and that the dignity and happiness of human nature confilRs in the exercise of its talents and virtues? For the pious and virtuous man, whose mind is enlarged and invigorated by the moll extensive range of knowledge, as he must have nobler views of all the objedts of piety and virtue than others, cannot fail to possess all the feelings that belong to them with greater poignancy, and perform all their ads with greater energy, than can be done by the untaught and illiterate."
"As the clergyman profe.lion is the only one that is entirely set aside and devoted to the service of mankind, he had much need to have. a double portion of difintereflednefs, and thelove of his species; neither of which can be acquired without that high nobility of foul, and ample capacity of heart, which is the portion of thole who are deeply conversant with all the liberal arts and sciences, and have the most intimate knowledge of the hiitory of man."
"And And yet the first is necessary to make his labours acceptable and efficacious among those for whom they are employed; and the second is necefary to make them easy and pleating to himself."
"But besides the general fitness for his important office, which is the fruit of a liberal education, there are particular parts of it, for which our candidate could not be tolerably well qualified, without this previous course of erudition. The inftruction of the young or ignorant, for instance, the visitation of the sick, the giving advice to the perplexed, comfort to the afflited, rebuke to the profligate, which are his daily ministrations, how could they be performed, confidering the infinite variety of characters, unless the Christian pastor perfecly understood the intricate ftruture of the human mind, knew all its fecretreceffes, and subtle wiles, all the springs of the passions and motives of action But farther, when we confider his func tion as a Chrifian orator, in what point can it be viewed, in which the advantages of a liberal education are not strikingly manifest? In the course of his tniniflrations there is almost no fuibjec on which he may not have occasion to ipeak Univerfal knowledge must then be ever at his command; since he cannot speak to advantage of what he does not thoroughly know."
"I intimate acquaintance with - holy scriptures, which contain tlh fyife:ni of docbtines, and the code of laws to which he niuil confiantly appeal, widch are full of examples both of a public and private nature, and are particularly enriched witil the gofiel of our Lord, the history of his life and death, and the propagation of our faitll; the lknowledge of thefc alone, Inuft ultimately prove a rich provision fur the Chriflian teacher: for it is chiefly to facilitate his just and accurate discernment ds the sense and design of those books, that he has made iuch a laborious preparation."
"D His His knowledge of the art of reasoning will enable our intrant into holy orders, to define and to prove with accuracy, and to unravel all the intricacies of sophistry."
"His fikill in rhetoric will teach him to form his orations in such a manner, as best to answer the purpose of eloquence, which is persuasion. His being an adept in the fcience of ethics, his perfecA acquaintance with the ftrucuure of the human mind, will dire: him to point the scope of his difcourses, so as to sway the passions of men, the Iprings of their condut1. History will furnifli him with fads and illustrations:"
"and even poetry itself will be subservient to his purpose ; because a great part of scripture is poetical, and because the lofty diction and figures of poetry have a near relation to those of oratory."
"In short, the mind of the Christian teacher being fully stored with all forts of knowledge befbre he begins to compose or speak, it will not be difficult for him to be a mafter in his art, Without this original fund of science, even considerable talents will prove deficient, and genius itfelffeem barren and deserted. The most painful preparation will produce discourses meagre and jejune, or at belt splendid patchwork of ill-conforted parts. Whereas they who have laid up in store an ample fund of many years preparation, can at all times, without any seeming effort, fend forth fi-om their neverfailing fountain of knowledge, such copious fireams, as flaall enrich and fertilize wherever they flow."
"But not only does this general prepara of our Christian orator render easy and effectual his daily labours; but every part of a liberal education is occasionally of very particular advantage to a minister."
"I flall give an instance or two of such as appear motl problematical."
"Of what use, it may be said, is the know ledge of the world, and elegant accompliflhments to a clergyman ? They are not neceflary in the exercise of his vocation; and they they tend rather to raise aversion in the lower orier-:, and to excite ridicule in the higher. But this objeclion is taken from what is too often to be seen, the (aIe&'ation ,of those qualities, and not the reality. ior the true knowlcdge of the woorld, and genuMilne accolmplifhn-icnts, must always appca. in imple a form, as nor to oilend, but to conciliate. They are a crown and ornament to all other talents and qualities, andt these lead the pofieifor ro produce them with such moodeft propriety as to overcome the molt pr-judiced. The preacher of rz 'eou/ncl inuft: be converfimnt witi imen of all ranks, if polilble to goain their rcfpect and good will, and reconcile therr to the truth: and that kind of dceeanour is ikcly to be motI iceisful, the prime quality of lwhich is, that it cannot cfend."
"It is our0 duty at all times with our ut molt addrcfs, to draw the attention and("
"countenance of the upper ranks of life ta the duties of religion ; and never was it Ynore io than at pirefent ; vwhen men principles principles of every kind are afloat, and when the angel with his warning voice seems to proclaim, oe to the inhabitants on earth ! It is in the nature of man when he is in high prosperity to dread no reverse of fortune;"
"when the age he lives in is highly enlightned, to believe that an ara of darkness can never return. But we have only to look back into the annals of the world to be undeceived. Look back, did I/fy ? \Ve have only to look. at the present moment, to our neighbouring state, to be convinced that xras of indifference and fanaticii': , of infidelity and fiipe.flition, arc nor fb ditfant from each other as we apprehend."
"And we should in such a slate, never cease to zwar with jlrongefq emphasis, those whom it chiefly concerns, that if they whos- situation entitles them to keep the teas, in the rational and manly, and most benevolent ystem of faith and worfilip which we now enjoy, fhiould negleed it; the tilne may be at hand, iz'.ten they ho in all things otzht to Jo.:/oi, may seize those reins which drop from feeble and indolent lhands, and realize realize again in this favoured isle, the fury and barbarity and darkness of former ages."
"Of what use, it may be said, is political knowledge to a clergyman ? That teems entirely foreign to the duties of his function. And it must be confefled, that to make men pious and virtuous, through the knowledge of the truth as it is in Christ 7e/us, is the great objec of our ministry;"
"for sincere and faithful Christians will of course be good fubjedts, obedient to the laws, and refpedtful to magistrates. But bc.ldes that, it must be observed, that we are placed in the middle between the higher and lower ranks of men, and as an eftablilhed church, are entrusted by our country with the charge of forming the minds of our people, to a due sense of the bleffn.gs of that good government, which we lave fiorn to maintain and defend; to inftrudc them in the nature of their rights and privilcges, as well as their duties ; and create in them a reverence and attachment to that constitution by which they hold their their religion and liberty, and all that is dear to them. Besides this necelfary duty in peaceable times, a minifier of this church ought to be well enlightened, and firmly eflablifled indeed, in his pclitical principles, that he may be able to stand faF:"
"himself, and to confirm his flock on the rising of fJich low ring clouds of/edition, as of late threatened this guilty laind with universal ruin. Had the clergy been uninformed, or diaTfecreed, or even lukewarm on that occasion, God only knows what a dreadful storm we might have now been encountering! Blefed be his name ! who hath delivered ius: by who mercy it is, that the proud waters have not overwhelmed our Jouls !"
"A 3d advantage to be derived from the liberal education of clergymen is, that it may prove ornamental to the society."
"Besides thecharacterof individuals, there are characters annexed to whole bodies of men which procure them the eiteem, or fix fix on them the contempt, of the world."
"An ignorant or immoral clergy could not fail to be disregarded. Church courts that should be variable in their decisions, and inconsistent in their measures, could never acquire or deserve the confidence of the public. Let us be thankful that the members of our church are held in general to be as learned and pious, and virtuous and orderly, as any ecclesiastics in the world."
"And our fulpreme court has justly obtaincd a due authority over the minds of the people, on account of the uniformity of its decrees, and the wisdom of its proceedings."
"But amidst the luminous sphere of our ecclesiastical heaven, there are conflellations that furpats the reft of the stars in fplendor and beauty; which enlighten at once and adorn. VWhat branch of literature is there, in which fbme of the ministers of this church have not excelled ? What subjec of fine writing is there, in which they do not, as authors, stand in the foremofl ranks rank:, which is a prouder boast than all the wealth and splendor of a hierarchy?"
"time would fail me filould I attempt to enumerate the works of the members of this church, who have fticcefsfully endeavoured to enlighten the world in alnoft every branch of knowledge."
"Not to mention treatises in defence of Christianity, or learned difiertations on facred criticifin, or eloquent illustrations of every branch of Chriatian dodtrine and morals, which more immediately belong to the clergy ;-Who are they who have wrote the most excellent hiflories ancient and modern ? They are clergymen of this church*."

"Thus it is that the liberal education of /"
"clergymen proves ornamental to the whole society, and fiupplies in some degree the want of wcalth and dignities. Hence, it is, that we are of some name in diitant regions, and that our order fleds some rays of glory on our native land. We are poor indeed, but we are rich in the best goods a church can poirefs, in the learning, the manners, and character of its members Ours. is a fplelndid poverty, it is the paupecrtas ;/cziida viUorium."
"Thus have I fulfilled my purpose, which was to fihew the utefulnefs and necessity of a liberal education for clergymen."
"Let it not be forgot however, that this education with all the advantages I have ascribed to it, must be underitood, as riving riving all the good that attends it, fiom the blessing of God, and the influence of his grace. For, though this influence is generally confidered as chiefly applicable to virtue, and the power of leading holy lives, while we ascribe all other talents and accomplifliments bflely to ourselves and our own efforts, yet the least refection will lead us to arrange these also under the divine agency. In himz .we live, and move, and have our being, without exception, or limitation; and we Ihall find that in all ages and nations, any extraordinary fikill in the useful arts, or any excellent knowledge of the sciences, has been attributed to the immediate in!piration of God."
"I have only now in the third place, to make application of what I have said to this Society."
"Is it then true, that a liberal education, in the moit extensive sense, is of the greateit adcvatage to the clergy of this church ?"
"I'Then Then may I congratulate and extol this society, for having undertaken a wct , that may ultimately prove of so much utility to our country. For, although your views are not limited to a tingle profeiioln, yet, the families of clergymen, having been long the most fruitful femiinaries ol the church, it is not improbable that Ihe may chiefly reap the benefit of your benevolence and care. For alas ! without your sOftering hand, how few of them will, in future, be able to procure even that education which the rules of the church so wifly require !"
"When the Presbyterian church escaped fiom the hand of periecution, and was reitored to the willes of the people of this country at the revolution, she partook of the narrow principles and illiberal spirit, whlich pervaded the minds of men in that tumultuous age. The sudden demand for candidates to fill up every charge, obliged her to receive many, whu were but half educated, of low habits and vulgar manners. Popular elecions continued for some some time to prolong the evil, and the clergy were neglcted, if not defiifed by the superior orders. At length, the intrants of the church, having been relieved from the fear of being reje&ced, for those very qualities that adhere to a liberal education, began to avail themselves of their acquired talents and accomplishments. Among the firif, was that dif tinguifiled person, * who for so lor a period, filled the place where I now stand, who ventured to leave the beaten trat of dry fcholaflic preaching, and enforced the morality of the gofj-el as well as its doctrines, with much ability and elocution."
"'I'his Tillotfon of the church of Scotland, as he has been called, was followed, and even excelled by some of his juniors, in the art of composition and eloquence, which he lived to fee and to rejoice in, with the mort cordial exultation."

"wherein so many members of this church have diftinguiihed thicmnfelves in the annals of literature, and almoit every individual in his ieveral sphere, has displayed the effefts of a liberal and learned education. How happy is it for those, far in the vale of years, who have so long sustained the honour and dignity of their profession, whose evening was clouded with the forebodings of the falling slate of the church, that they can now look with glad presage, to this most benevolent and generous inflitution, which promises to prolong the day of light and liberality to our order."
"Their hopes I trust are not too fan guine; for the design of this society has already drawn the attention of our most gracious /overeign, whose watchful eye is upon every corner of his dominions, to preserve and extend the reign of liberty and happiness among his people. His Majesty approbation was first expressed, by his grant of a royal charter, by which you you are formed into a corporate body;"
"which was soon after inforced by a most liberal donation. His illustrious example will be followed. For, whatever marks of degeneracy may belong to this age, a want of munificence is none of them, nor a low standard of virtue; else the king on the throne would not be so much loved and revered."
"Need I address myself to you, my Reve rend Brethren, who are so deeply interested in those who are to reap the benefit of this humane and beneficent institution, which along with relief, however, carries with it a proof of your indigent condition."
"The commencement of the wonderful progrefs of this country in industry and wealth, is within the remembrance of the -,'oungeft among you. You have contributed to this national prosperity, by those excellent lelTons of sobriety and virtue, of industry and oeconomy, which you have given your people, and by the example that you have set before them. All ranks have have profited by it, but you. The proprietor has more than doubled his rent, the tradefinanhis flock, the husbandman and labourer his profits and wages. You alone remain in general with the ifme scanty allowance, which was fettled on you almnoft a century ago : Which then indeed bore some reasonable proportion to the state of the country, but is now depreciated to one third of the value it had then."
"Your good conduct, has likcwifc had no fnall fiare in preserving the peace of the country, as well as in promoting its profperity, while it has raised your reputation, as high as that of any clergy in Europe."
"What recompence might have been expected for your uniform and tfeady virtue ?"
"You wish for no more, than is abfo lutely necessary to preisrve the credit of your order. You with to be put as nearly as may be into the fame proportional itate, in refpec to the advanced opulence of your country, as was held by your predecessors, for some time after the Presbyterian church wras was restored. Preferment and rewards'"
"are out of the question. Our eftablihmnent admits osso few that they need hardly be mentioned. But set apart as you are, and devoted to the public welfare and .happiness, and precluded from every lucrative employment, you surely ought to be raiied above a degrading slate of poverty."
"You are entitled to a competency, that you may perform your duty with due freedom of spirit; that you may occasionally exercise the evangelical virtues of hofpitality and almsgiving; that you may give your children the rudiments of a libei-al education, and, having nothing else to befirow, may leave them the credit and pro."
"tection of 3your good name."
"If this is denied you, ascribe it not to the want of countenance from those who hold the executive government of this country, for they have exprefTid their fa, your fr yo, in the moit unequivocal terms. Afl-ibe it not to the supreme court of law ; for, governed by a manly and li beral beral spirit, that body must often regret that their powers are too much limited."
"Surely you cannot ascribe it to the ariflocracy of this country; whose generous minds, expanding with their fortunes, muff prompt them to impart to you some Jhall share of their accumulated wealth, for your faithful services, and to preserve you in the capacity of serving them more."
"Surely, warned by the danger to which they were bo lately exposed, they mull wifl to unite you, as much as poflble, to themselves, and to tie closer the bond of amity between you; and, foreseeing the future in the pait, mutl wifely provide againft the next evil day, when the demon of sedition lhall rage once more, and the people again imagine a vain thinlg Whatever fiall liappen, console your selves with this, that the public opinion is strongly in your favour, and that as there is no government so much swayed by opinion as ours, if you preserve your character for purity of manners, and im portance portance to your country, sooner or later lhe must do you justice. In the mean time, should any of you be cut off in the midtime of your clays, which is frequently the lot of the best of men, you are not so forlorn as many of your predecessors of late have been, for you may comfort your elves withr the pleasing profped that is opened up to you, in the paternal care and guardianship of this moit benevolent society. hom nzmay the God of theJatherIejs prosper and blejs Let me conclude by addrefilng myself to the contributors at large, and all who encourage this most laudable und-ertaking. If there is any truth in what I have represented, you have the fatisfacion and the honour of contributing to preserve, in some degree of credit, an order of men noft useful and necessary for the support of religion, of morals, and good order in the state. To you it will be owing that a minister of the gospel, who has laboured ail his life for the good of fouls, and who, conscious conscious of diligence and fidelity in his laster work, has nothing to fadden the evening of his days, but anxious fears for those he ihall leave behind him, may now meet the last hour with unconcern, because his children if they are worthy, may become the adopted children of this Society; will be treated with all the prudent care, if not with the fond partiality of paternal affection, and with more wisdom and providence than they could have fliewn, will be safely ushered into the world."
"You understand the full force of that faying of our Lord  It is more blefed to give than to receive. You look forward with joy to that great day when all you have done ffiall meet with that kind interpretation from your Redeemer and Judge, ForaJinuch as rou have done it unto the leafi of the you have done it unto me. You have discovered the chief good. You have learned to anticipate celestial joys; for charity is heaven begun in the heart of man, and paradise itfelfis only the consummation of charity. Amen."
