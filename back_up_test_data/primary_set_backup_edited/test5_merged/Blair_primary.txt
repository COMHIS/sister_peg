"Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God."
"Yc HE High and Lofty One who ST inhabiteth eternity, dwelleth also I'"
"J;.'*wzvith him that is of' humble and contrite heart. Iri the midst of his glory, the Almighty is not inattentive to the meanest of his fubjeas. Neither obscurity of flation, nor imperfection of knowledge, sinks those below his  regard, who worship and obey him. Every Sprayer which they fend up from their fe.ret retirements, is lifteoed to by him; and every work of charity which they perform, how unknown soever to the world, attracts his notice. The Text presents a signal instance of this comfortable truth."
"In the city of Caesarea, there dwelt a Roman centurion, a military officer of inferiour rank, a Gentile, neither by birth nor religion entitled to the privileges of the Jewish nation. But he was a devout and a benevolent man; who, according to his measure of religious knowledge, fludied to perform his duty, prayed to God always, and gave much alms to the people. Such a character passed not unobserved by God. So highly was it honoured, that to this good centurion an Angel was sent from heaven, in order to dire him to the means of full-ipftruction in the truth, The Angel accosts him with this salutation, Cornelius, Thy prayqrs and thine alms are come up for a memorial bo3re Qod."
"It is to the conjuncion of prayers and alms, that I purpose now to direct your thoughts, as describing the refpeaable and amiable charaaer of a man, as forming the honour and the blessedness of a true Chriflian; piety joined with charity, faith with good works, devotion with morality. These are things which God hath conneded, and which it is impious in man to separate. It is only when they remain united, that they can come up as a grateful memorial before God. I shall first endeavour to thew you, That alms with out prayers, or prayers without alms, morality without devotion, or devotion without morality, are extremely defeCive ; and then shall point out the happy effects of their mutual union."
"LET us begin with considering the cafe of alms without prayers; that is, of good works without piety, or a proper sense of God and Religion. Examples of this are nor uncommon in the world. With many, Virtue is, or at least is pretended to be, a refpeaable and an honoured -.- name, while Piety founds meanly in their ears. They are men of the world, and they claim to be men of honour. They reft upon their humanity,' their publick spirit, their probity, and their truth."
"They arrogate to themselves all the manly and the aaive virtues. But devout affections, and religious duties, they treat with contempt, as founded on shadowy fpeculations, and fit to employ the attention only of weak and superstitious minds."
"Now, in opposition to such persons, I contend, That this neglea of piety argues depravity of heart; and that it infers an irregular discharge of the duties of morality."
"FIRST, It argues internal depravity; for it discovers -a cold and a hard heart."
"If there be any impression which man is'"
"formed by nature to receive, it is a sense of religion. As soon as his mind opens to observation and refletion, he discerns innumerable marks of his dependent slate."
"He finds himself placed, by some superiour power, in a vast world, where the wisdom and goodness of the Creator are conspicuous on every  The magnificence, the beauty and order of nature, excite him to admire and adore. When he looks up to that omnipotent hand which operates throughout the universe, he is impressed with reverence. When he receives blessings which he cannot avoid ascribing to divine goodness, he is prompted to gratitude. The expressions of those affections under the various forms of religious worship, are no other than native effufions of the human heart. Ig-4 norance may mislead, and superstition may corrupt them; but their origin is derived from sentiments that are essential to man."
"Cast your eyes over the whole earth."
"Explore the most remote quarters of the east or the weft. You may discover tribes, of men, without policy, or laws, or cities,."
"or any of the arts of life: But no where will you find them without some form of religion. In every region you behold the SE  prostrate worshipper, the temple, the al-- tar, and the offering. Wherever men have existed, they have been sensible that some acknowledgment was due, on their part, to the Sovereign of the world. If in their rudest and most ignorant state, this obligation has been felt, what additional force must it acquire by the improvements of human knowledge, but especially by the great discoveries of the Christian revelation ? Whatever, either from reverence or from gratitude, can excite men to the worship of God, is by this revelation placed in such a light, as one should think were fufficient to over-awe the most thoughtless, and to melt the most obdurate mind."
"Canst thou, then, pretend to be a man of reason, nay, a man of virtue, and yet continue regardless of one of the first and chief dictates of human nature ? Where is thy sensibility to what is right and fit, if that loud voice which calls all nations throughout the earth to religious homage, has never been heard by thee ? Or, if it , been heard, by what strange and false ) "
"refinements haft thou stifled those natural sentiments which it tends to awaken ?"
"Calling thyself a son, a citizen, a friend I claiming to be faithful and affectionate in these telations; haft thou no sense of what thou oweft to thy first Parent, thy highest Sovereign, thy greatest Benefactor ? Can it be consistent with true virtue bt honour, to value thyself upon thy regard to inferiour obligationsi and- yet to violate that which is the moss facted and the most ancient of all ? When simple inftin& teaches the Tartar and the Indian, together with his alms and good works to join his prayers to that Power whom he considers as the source of good, shall it be no reproach, in thb most enlightened flats of human nature, and under the puteft dispensation of religion, to have extinguifhed the sense of gratitude to Heaven, and to flight all acknowledgment of the great and the true God? What does such condut& imply, but either an entire want, or a wilful fupprefioo, of some of the best  and most generous affetions belonging to - human nature ?-Surely, there muff be an essential defect in that heart which remains cold and insensible, where it ought to be affeaed most warmly. Surely, such a degree of depravity must be lodged there, as is fufficient to taint all the other springs of pretended virtue. '"
"BUT besides this, I must contend, in the second place, That where religion is negleded, there can be no regular nor steady pracice of the duties of morality, The characer will be often inconsistent; and Virtue placed on a basis too narrow to support it, will be always loose and tottering. For such is the propensity of our nature to vice, so numerous are the temptations to a relaxed and immoral condudt, that fironger restraints than those of mere reason, are necessary to be imposed 'on man. The sense of right and wrong, the principle of honour, or the inflina of benevolence, are barriers too feeble to withstand the strength of paffioq."
"In the tranquil seasons of life, these natu- sE "
"ral principles may, perhaps, carry on the _ ordinary course of social duties with some regularity. But wait until some trying emergence come. Let the conflit oý passions arise. Let 'the heart be either wounded by fore distress, or agitated by violent emotions; and you shall presently fee, that virtue without religion is inadequate to the government of life. It is deftitute of its proper guard, of its firmest support, of its chief encouragement. It will fink under the weight of misfortune; or will yield to the solicitation of guilt."
"* The great motives that produce conflancy and firmness of a6ion, must be of a palpable and firiking kind. A divine Legiflator, uttering his voice from heaven; an omnifpient Witness, beholding us in all our retreats; an almighty Governour, stretching forth his arm to punish or reward, disclosing the secrets of the invisible world, informing us of perpetual reft prepared hereafter for the righteous, and of indignation and wrath awaiting the wicked:"
"SE  There are the considerations which overs awe the world, which support integrity, "
"and check guilt. They add to virtue that solemnity which should ever charadterize it. To the admonitions of confcienee they give the authority of a law. Co-operating with all the good dispositions of a pious man, they strengthen and insure their influence. On his alms you can have nb certain dependance, who thinks not of God, nor has joined prayer to his charitable deeds. But when humanity is feconded by piety, the spring from which it flows is rendered, of course, more regular and conflant.-In short, withdraw religion, and you shake all the pillars of morality. In every heart you weakert the influence of virtue: And among the multitude, the bulk of maDkind, you overthrow its power."
"HA VING thus shewn that morality without devotion is both defecive and unflable, I proceed to confider the other extreme, of prayers without almsl devotion without morality."
"In every age the pratice has prevailed, "
"of substituting certain appearances of piety I."
"in the place of the great duties of humanity and mercy. Too many there have always been, who flatter themselves with the hope of obtaining the friendship of their Creator, though they negled to do juffice to their fellow-creatures. But such persons may be assured, that their supposed piety is altogether of a spurious, kind. It is an invention of their own, unknown to reason, unknown in the word of God. Int scripture we are ever directed to try our faith by our works, our love of God by our love of men. We are direCed to confider piety as a principle which regenerates the heart, and forms it to goodness. We are taught, that in vain we address any ads of homage to Christ, unless we do the things which he faith ; and that love, peace, gentlenefs, goodness, meekness and temperance are not only the injundions of his law, but the native fruits of his spirit *. If, there * Luke  46. GaL  22."
"fore, while piety seems ardent, morality I Sfhall decline, you have full reason to be lieve, that into that piety some corrupting ingredients have entered. And if ever your regard to morality shall totally fail; if, while you make many prayers, you give no alms; if, while you appear to be zealous for God, your are false or unjust to men; if you are hard or contraced in heart, severe in your censures, and oppreffive in your condut;. then, conclude with certainty, that what you had termed piety was no more than an empty name. For as soon, according to the scripture fimilitude, will bitter waters flow from afweet fountain, as such effecs be produced by genuine piety."
"What you have called by that name, "
"resolves itself into one or other of three things. Either it is a hypocritical form of godliness, assumed in order to impose on the world; or, which is the most favourable supposition, it is a transient impreflion of seriousness, an accidental melting of the heart, which passes away like the morning cloud and the early dew; or, "
"which I am afraid is too often the cafe, -"
"it is the deliberate refuge of a deluded and superstitious, but at the fame time a corrupted mind. For all men, even the most depraved, are fubjea, more or less, to compunaions of conscience. It has never been in their power to withdraw totally beyond the reach of that warning voice, which tells them that something is necessary to be done, in order to make their peace with the Ruler of the world."
"But, backward at the fame time to resign the gains of dishonesty, or the pleasures of vice; averse from submission to that sacred law which enjoins righteousness in its whole extent, they have often attempted to make a fort of composition with Heaven; a composition, which, though they dare not avow it in words, lurks in secret at the bottom of many a heart. If God will only dispense with some articles of obedience, they will repay him with abundant homage. If they fail in good praaice, they will fludy to  be found in belief; and, by the number of their prayers, will ;tone, in some measure, "
"for their deficiency in charitable deeds."
"But the attempt is as vain, as it is im pious. From the simplest and plainest principles of reason it must appear, that religious worlhip, disjoined from justice and virtue, can upon no account whatever find acceptance with the Supreme Being. To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me ? faith the Lord."
"Bring no more vain oblations. Incense is an abomination unto me. The new moons and fabbaths, the calling of ajjmblies, I cannot away with ; it is iniquity, even the solemn meetings *.- Cease, foolifl and impious man! Cease to confider the Almighty as a weak or vain-glorious being, who is to be appeased by thy devout proftrations, and thy humble words; or to be gratified by the parade and ostentation of external worihip. What is all thy worship to him?"
"Will be eat the flejh of thy sacrifices, or drink the blqod of ofered goats ? Was worship required of thee, dost thou think, upon his account, that thou mighteft --"
"bring any increase to his glory and felicity by thy weak and insignificant praises ?"
"Sooner mighteft thou increase the fplendour of the fun by a lighted taper, or add to the thunder by thy voice. No: It is for the fake of man, not of God, that wor(hip and prayers are required; not that Go4 may be rendered more glorious, but that man may be made better ; that he may be confirmed in a proper sense of his "
"pendent slate, and acquire those pious and virtuous dispositions in which his highelf jiproveqent consists."
"Of all the principles in religion, one thould take this to be the most evident; and yet frequent admonitions are needed, to renew the impression of it upon mankind. For what purpose did thy Creator place thee in this world, in the midst of human society, but that as a man among ,men thou mightqft cultivate humanity; <bat each in his place might contribute to the general welfare; that as a spouse, a  brother, a son, or a friend, thou mighteft -- a thy part with an upright and a tender heart; and thus aspire to resemble Him who ever consults the good of his creatures, and whose tender mercies are over all his works ? And dareft thou, who haft been sacrificing unfufpicious innocence to thy loose pleasures; thou, who haft been disturbing the repose of society by thine ambition or craft; thou, who, to increase thy treasures, haft been making the widow and the orphan weep; dareft thou approach God with thy worship and thy prayers, and entertain the hope that he will look down upon thee in peace ? Will the God of order and justice accept such poor compensation for his violated laws ?"
"Will the God of love regard the services of one who is an enemy to his creatures ?"
"Shall a corrupter of the society of men aspire to the habitations of pure and bleffed spirits ?-Believe it, He that faith he loveth God, mufi love his brother also. Cease to do evil; learn to do well. . Seek judgment ; relieve the opprefed, judge the fa "
"thArlefs, plead for the widow: And then; Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh '"
"to thee; call upon him in the day of trouble, and he will answer thee. Thy prayers and thine alms shall then ascend, in joint memorial, before the Most High; I HAVE now shown the evil of niaim and splitting religion; of dividing asunder two .things, which though in theory they may be separated, yet in praaice muff always co-exist if either of them be real, Devotion to God, and Charity to men. Let us confider next the happy effeas of their union."
"Their union forms the confiflent, the graceful, the refpedable characer of the real Chriftlan, the man of true worth."
"If you leave either of them out of your system, even though you excel irn the other, you can fland trial only in one point of view. It is only on one your charaaer is fair; on the other, it will always be open to much reproach."
"And as you dilhonour yourselves, so you SE RM do great injustice to xeligion. For, by -- dividing its parts fiom one another, you never fail to expose it to the cenfur6 of the world: And perhaps, by this fort of partial and divided goodness, religion has fuffered more the esteem of inankindd than by open profligacy. The unbeliever will fcoff at yout piety, ,when he fees you negligent of moral duties. The bigot will decry all morality, when he fees you pretending to be a follower of virtue, though you be a despiser of God. Whereas he who fears God, and is at the fame -time jilft and beneficent to men, exhibits religion to the world wirh full propriety. It Ih'ines in his-condua with its native fplendour ; and its rays throw a glory round .him. His charater is above reproach."
"It is at once amiablehand 'venerable. Malice itself is afraid 'to attack him; and even the worst men refpe iand honour him in their hearts.

- This too is the -man whose life will be tnoft peaceful and happy. He who fails materially either in piety or in virtue, is Aalway obnoxious to the anguilh of remorse. His partial goodnqfs may flatter kia in tbe day of fupqrficial observation ; but when solitude or distress awakens the powers  refletion, he hall be made to feel, that oile part ps duty performed, atones not for another which is neglected.
In the midst of his prayers, the remem,brance of injustice will upbraid him with bypocrify: and in the distribution of his alms, the prayers which the poor put up for him, will make him blush for his neglea of God. Conscience will supply the place of the hand coming forth to write over against him on the wall, Thou art *weighed in the balance, and art found wanting *. Whereas he who holds both faith and a good conscience, who attends equally .to'the discharge of his duty towards God and towards'man, enjoys, as far as hu.man imperfetion allows, the sense of .fairnfs and confiftenoy in condut, of integrity and soundness of heart."
"The man of mere morality, is a stranger -to all the delicate.and. refined pleasures of devotion. In works of beneficence and . mercy, he may enjoy fatisfa6ion. But his fatisfa6tion is deflitute of that glow of affection, which enlivens the feelings of one who lifts his heart at the fame time to the Father of the universe, and confiders himself as imitating God. The man again who rests solely on devotion, if that devotion open not his heart to humanity, not only remains a firanger to the pleafures of beneficence, but must often undergo the pain arising from bad passions."
"But when beneficence and devotion are united, they pour upon the man in whom they meet, the full pleasures of a good and pure heart. His alms conneaed him with men; his prayers with God. He looks without dismay on both worlds."
"All nature has to him a benign afpe&."
"If engaged in a&ive life, he is the friend of men; and he is happy in the exertions of that friendship. If left in retirement, he walks among the works of nature, as with God. Every obje& is enlivened to him by the sense of the Divine presence. Every where he traces the beneficent hand of the Author of nature; and every where, with glowing heart, he hears and answers his secret voice."
"When he looks up to heaven, he rejoices in the thought that there dwells that God whom he serves and honours; that Saviour in whom he trusts; that Spirit of grace from whose inspiration his piety and his charity flow. When he looks around him on the world, he is soothed with the pleasing remembrance of good offices which he has done, or at least has fludied to do, to many who dwell there. How comfortable the refleaion, that him no poor man can upbraid for having with-held his due; him no unfortunate man can reproach for having seen and despised his sorrows; but that on his head are descending the prayers of the needy and the aged; and that the hands of those whom his proteaion has supported, or his bounty has fed, are lifted up in secret to bless him!"
"Life passed under the influence of such ifpofitions, naturally leads to a happy ERM. end. It is not enough to fay; that faith . and piety, joined with ative virtue, c6n flitute the requisite preparation for heaven. They in truth begin the enjoyment of heaven. In every slate of our existence, they form the chief ingredients of felicity."
"Hence they are the great marks of Chri-."
"flian regeneration. They are the fignature of that Holy Spirit, by which good men are said to be sealed unto the day of redemption.-The Text affords a firiking proof of the estimation in which they are held by God.

He remarked the. amiable dispositions which rose in the heart of this good man. But he saw that they were yet imperfea, while he remained unenlightened by the principles of the Christian religion.

# SERMON  On the Influence of Religion upon Adversity.

## PSAL. xxvii. 5. In the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.



On the Influence of RELIGION upon In the time of trouble, he Jhall hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tabernacle Jhall he hide me ; he Jhall jet me up upon a rock.

THE life of man has always been a very mixed slate, full of uncertain- IL ty and vicissitude, of anxieties and fears.
In every religious audience, there are many who fall under the denomination of the unfortunate; and the reft are ignorant how soon they may be called to join them. For the prosperity of no man pn earth is stable and assured. Dark  clouds may soon gather over the heads of , those whose sky is now most bright. In the midst of the deceitful calm which they enjoy, .the storm that is to overwhelm them has perhaps already begun to ferment. If a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness, for they Jfall be many *.

Hence, to a thoughtful mind, no study can appear more important, than how to be suitably prepared for the misfortunes of life; so as to contemplate them in prospeC without dismay, and, if they muff befal, to bear them without dejedion.
Throughout every age, the wisdom of the wife, the treasures of the rich, and the power of the mighty, have been employed, either in guarding their slate against the approach of distress, or in rendering themselves less vulnerable by its attacks.
Power has endeavoured to remove adverfity to a distance. Philosophy has studied, when it drew nigh, to conquer it by patience; and Wealth has fought out every pleasure that cad compensate or alleviate pain.

While the wisdom of the world is thus occupied, religion has been no less atterttive to the fame 'important objea. It inforihs us In the Text, of a pavilion which God ereds to shelter his servants in the time of trofble, of afecretplace in his tabernacle into which he brings them, of a rock on which he sets them up; and elsewhere he tells us, of a hield and a buckler which he spreads before them, to cover thetnfrom the terrour by night, and the arrow that flieth by day. Now, of what nature are those instruments of defence, which God is represented as providing with such solicitous care for those who fear him? Has he reared up any bulwarks, impregnable by misfortune, in order to separate the pious and virtuous from the reft of mankind, and to screen them from the common disasters of life ?
No: To those disasters we behold them liable no less than others. The defence which religion provides, is altogether of ER aM. an internal kind. It is the heart, not the outward slate, which it profeffes to guard.

When the time of trouble comes, as come it must to all, it places good men under the pavilion of the Almighty, by affording them that security and peace which arise from the belief of divine proteaion, It brings them into thefecret of his tabernacle, by opening to them sources of confolation which are hidden from others, .By that flrength of mind with which it endows them, it Jets them up upon a rock, against which the tempest may violently beat, but which it cannot thake.

How far the comforts proceeding from religion merit those high titles under which they are here figuratively defcribed, I shall in this discourse endeavour to show. I shall for this end compare together the situation of bad men and that of the good, when both are fuffering/the misfortunes of life; and then make such improvement as the fubjea will naturally suggest.


I. RELIGION prepares the mind for en- SEk .

cbuntering, with fortitude, the most severe _ ihocks of adversity; whereas vice, by its natural influence on the temper, tends to produce dejetion under the slightest trials.
While worldly men enlarge their possesfions, and extend their connections, they imagine that they are strengthening themselves against all the possible vicissitudes of life. They fay in their hearts, My mountain fandsflrong, and IJhall never be moved. But so fatal is their delusion, that, instead of strengthening, they are weakening that which only can support them when thore vicissitudes come. It is their mind which muff then support them and their mind, by their sensual attachments, is corrupted and enfeebled. Addieted with intemperate fondness to .
pleasures of the world, they incur twd great and certain evils; they both exclude themselves from every refourLe except the world, and they increase thei:
sensibility to every blow which comes upon them from that quarter.

They have peither princripes nor tem. , per which cia fland theaffýalt of trouble They have no principleq which lead thwp to look beyond the .dinary xotation if events; and therefore, .vyhen apisforEuqe involve them, -the ,profpet muff be c9%-
frdtlefs on every  Tlie primes -have jd.quflified btem fcor .loqking up to the fiftlance of any higherlp9wer than ieir Spwa bilty,,or for relyipg qn any better guide than their own wisdom. And as 9m principle, they can derive npo fiup port, so in . temper corrupt4ed pro fperity they fipnd np relief, They have lotc that moderation of mind 'which qnr ablos ; wife man to accommodate hinmflf to ,his situation. ,Long fpd with, false hopes, .they axe exasperated aqd flung by every difappoQpttpent. Luxurious pn4 pffeminate, they gai bear-;no ,vneafinef.
Prpud and pre:fumnptuoup, they can brooi no oppofltion. ,pouriAhing difpofitiona which so little ,it this uncertai4g iate, they have inf{ued a dobpepgqtT,of jit7 ternefs into the cup of woe;., they fa1ae hlarpened the edge of that sward which is lifted up to finite them. Strangers to all the temperate Tatisfadions of a good and a pure mind; strangers to every pleasure ercept what was seasoned by vice or vanity, their adversity is to the last dqgree difconsolate. Health and opulence were the two pillars en which they reled. -Shake either of them I and their whole edifice of hope and comfort falls. Prdftrate and forloarn they are left on the ground; obliged to join with the man of Vphraim in his abr jea tamentation, They have taken ay my gods, *which I hawe inade, and *what ihave: I more * ?-Such are the causes 'to which we must ascribe the brokeki fpirts, the peevish temper, and impatient passions, that so pften attend the declining age, or falling fortunes of vicious -men.


But how different is the condition of a truly good man in .those trying fituationo .of life ! Religion had gradually prsepred his mind for all the events of this iaqonr itantrfiate. It had inftruded him 'in the * Judes ailli. 24. -  I nature of true happiness. It had early 11. weaned him from the undue love of the world, by discovering to him its vanity, and by setting higher profpeas in his view. Afflifions do not attack him by surprise, and therefore do not overwhelm him. He was equipped for the florm, as well as the calm, in this dubious navigation of life. Under those conditions he knew himself to be brought hither, that he -was not to retain always the enjoyrnent of what he loved: And therefore he is not overcome by disappointment, when that which is mortal, dies; when that which is mutable, begins to change; and when that which he knew to be transient, passes away.

All the principles which religion teaches, 
and all the hlabits which it forms, are favourable to firength of mind. It will be f6und, that whatever purifies, fortifies also the heart. In the course of living righteously, soberly, and godly, a good man acquires a steady and well-governed fpitit. Trainel, by Divine grace, to enjoy with moderation the advantages of the world, neither lifted up by success, nor .
enervated with sensuality, he meets the changes, in his lot without unmanly dejedion, He is inured to temperance and restraint. He has learned firmness and felf-command. He is accustomed to look up to that Supreme Providence, which disposes of human affairs, not with reverence only, but with trust and hope.

The time of prosperity was to him not merely a season of barren joy, but produaive of much useful improvement, He had cultivated his mind. He had flored it with useful knowledge, with good principles, and virtuous difpofi*
tions. These resources remain entire, when the days of trouble come. They remain with him in sickness, as in health in poverty, as in the midfl of riches; in his dark and solitary hours, no less than when surrounded with friends and gay society. From the glare of prosperity, he can, without deje&ion, 
 RM. withdraw into the shade. Excluded ' from several advantages of the world, 
he may be obliged to retreat into a narrower circle; but within that circle he will find many comforts left. His chief pleasures were always of the calm, innocent, and temperate kind; and over there, the changes of the world have the least power. His mind is a kingdom to him; and he can flill' enjoy it. The world did not bestow upon him all 'his enjoyments; and therefore it is not in the poyer of the world, by its most cruel attacks, to carry them all away.
  THE difireffes of life are alleviated to good men, by reflections on their past condua; while, by such refledions, they are highly aggravated to the bad. During the gay and aaive periods of life, sinners ýelude, in some measure, the force of conscience. Carried round in the whirl of affairs and pleasures; intent on contrivance, or eager in pursuit; amused by hope, or elated by enjoyment; they are sheltered by thit croud 8f frifles which furrotrids SE 
them, ft61h serious fhought. But tonfdiencd is too great a power to retnain always suppressed. There is in every man life, a period 4when he shall be 'made to fland forth as a 'real objeCt to his own view: And when that period c6des, W6 to him who is galled by the fight! 'In the dark and solitary hour of liftrefs, with a mind hurt and fore from some recent wound of fortune, how fhafl he bear to have his charaCter for the first time disclosed to him, in that humiliating light under which guilt will necessarily prefeht it ? Then, the recollecion of the 'paft becomes dreadful. It exhibits to him a life thrown away on vanities and follies, or consumed in flagitioufnefs and fin; no itation properly supported; no material duties fulfilled. Crimes -which once had been easily palliated, rife before him in fheir native deformity. The sense of guilt mixes itferf with all that has befallen him.
'He behl6ds, or thinks that he beholds, the hand of the God %Yhom he hath of "

The piety and virtue of his former life were as feeds sown in his prosperous slate, of which he reaps the fruits in the season of adversity. The riches, the pleasures, and the friends of the world, may have made wings to themselves, and sown away. But the improvement which he made of those advantages while they lasted, the temperate spirit with which he enjoyed them, the beneficent aCions which he performed, and the good example which he set to others, remain behind. By the memory of these, he enjoys his prosperity a fecond time in refletion; and perhaps this second and refle enjoyment is not inferiour to the first. It arrives at a more critical and needful time. It affords him the high fatisfation of having extraaed lasing pleasure from that which is lhort; and of having fixed that which by its nature was changing.- If my race be  now about to end, I have this com

"6 that misfortunes alone form the chief misery of man. None but the guilty are completely miserable. The misgiving and distrust, the accusations and reproaches of their minds, the sense of having drawn down upon their heads the evils which they fuffer,'and the terrifying expedation of more and worse evils to come; these are the essential ingredients of human misery. They not only whet the edge, but they envenom the darts of affli&ion, and add poison to the wound. Whereas, when misfortunes assail a good man, they carry no such fatal auxiliaries in their train. They may ruffle the surface of 'his foul; but there is a strength, within, which resists their farther imprefion. The constitution of his mind is found. The world can inflia upon it no wounds, but what admit of cure."

feel all its weakness by the pressure of adversity. Dejeced with evils which overpower its strength, it relies no longer on itself. It casts every where around, a wishing, exploring eye, for some shelter to screen, some power to uphold it; and if, when abandoned by the world, it can find nothing to which it may fly in the room of the world, its slate is truly forlorn. pow, whither should the ungodly, in this situation, turn for aid ? After having contended with the florms of adverse fortune till their spirits are exhausted, gladly would they retreat at last to the fanauary of religion. But that fanauary is thut against them; nay, it is environed with terrours. They behold there, not a Prote&or to whom they can fly, but a Judge whom they dread; and in those moments when they need his friendship the most, they are reduced to deprecate his wrath. If he once called when they reftufed, and Jfretched out his hands when they would not regard, how much reafor - have they to fear that he will leave them n6w to eat* the fruit of their own ways, and to be filled' with their own devi'ces that he will laugh at their calamity, and Smock when theirfear tometh ?

But of all the thoughts which can enter into the mind, in the season of diftreis, the belief of' an interest in his favour who rules, the world is the most soothing.
Every form of religion has afforded to virtuous men some degree of this confoTation. But' it was reserved for the Chriftian revelation, to carry it to its highe4 point. For it is the direa scope of that revelation, to accommodate tifelf to though circumstances of man, under two rhair ews; as guilty in the fight of God, and as ffruggling with the evils of the world. Under the former, it discovers to him a Mediator and an atonement; under the latter, it promises him the Spirit of grace and consolation. It is'a system of complete relief, extending from our spiritual to our' temporal distresses.

But much more when those pleasures, one after another, begin to withdraw; when life alters its form, and 8 ER  becomes dark and chearlefs; when its * changes warn the most inconsiderate, that what is so mutable will soon pass entirely -way; then, with pungent earnestness comes home that question to the heart, Into what world are we next to go ?- -
How miserable the man, who, under the diftraaions of calamity, hangs doubtful about an event which so nearly concerns him; who, in the midst of doubts and anxieties, approaching to *that awful boundary which separates this world from the next, shudders at the dark profpec before him; wishing to exist after death, and yet afraid of that existence; catching at every feeble hope which fuperflition can afford him, and trembling, in the fame moment, from refledion upon his crimes!

But blessed be God who hath brought life and immortality to light; who hath not only brought them to light, but secured them to good men; and by the death and refurrediop of Jesus Christ, hath begotten them unto the lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not 
away. Justly is'this hope flyled in fcrip-i ture, the anchor of the fpol,, both Jure and Jfedfafl. or what an anchor is to a lhip in a dark night, on. an, unknown coast, and ainidft a boisterous ocean, that is this hope to the foul .when :diftrated by.
the confusions of the, world. In danger, it gives ,security; amidst general fluauation, it .affords one fixed point of ref. It is indeed the most eminent of all the advantages which religion now, confers.
For, confider the mighty power of hope over the human mind. It is the univerfal comforter. It is the, fpripg of all human a6tivity. Upon futurity;, men are conflantly fufpendedc Animated by the profpel of some distant good, they toil and fuffer, through the whole course of life; and it is not  much what they are at present, as what, they hope to be in fome.after time,, that enlivens their motions; fixes attention, and stimulates induftry..

The disorders which vice has introduced into the works of God, are about to terminate; and all tears are soon to be wiped away from the eyes of the juft.-The firm asfurance of this happy conclusion to the yexations and the vanities of life, works a greater effeft on the sincere illiterate Chriflian, than all the refinements of philolophy can work on the molf learned Infidele These miy gratify the mind that is at cafe; may fCoth the heart when slightly discomposed; but when it is fqre and deeply torn, w4en bereaved of its best '. ard most beloved comforts, 'the orily'con IL Sifolations that can.then find access, arise from the hope of a better world; where those comforts shall be again restored; and all the virtuous shall be assembled, in the presence of him who made them.
Such hopes banish that despair which overwhelms, and leave only that tender melancholy which softens the heart, and often renders the whole charaCter more gentle and amiable. '

OF this nature are- the resources which religibn provides for good men. By its previous discipline, it trains them to fortitude; by the refletions of a good conscience it fooths, by the sense of Divine favour it supports them; and when every comfort fails them on earth, it chears them with the hope of Heaven. Diftinguifhing his servants with such advantages, God is justly said to ereCt his pavilion over them in the evil time. He not onlyfpreads a tent for them in the *wilderness, but he transforms in some measure the. Rate of nature around them. To use the beautiful language of ancient prophecy; In the  -
fart, the thirfly land, where no water is, he openeth springs. -Itnlead of the thorn, he'maketh the fir-tree to come up ; infead of the briar, the myrtle tofpring. In midfl of the habitation of dragons, he maketh green paflures rife, and f9ill waters flow around his people.

THE improvement to be made of there truths, is as obvious, as it is important.
Let us fludy so to condut our lives, that we may be qualified for deriving such confolations from religion. To their reality, and their importance, all mankind bear witness. For no sooner are they overtaken ,by distress, than to religion they fly.
This, throughout every age, has been the universal shelter which the young and the old, the high and the low, the giddy and the serious, have fought to gain, as soon as they found- that reft could be no where else procured for the weary head, or the aching thAt croid to religion for relief, sow few  are entitled to approach that sacred source of comfort ? On what feeble iprops -&
their hopes and 'pretenfions relt ? Ho, much superstition mingles with that religion to which men are driven by ýdifirefs and fear You must first apply to 'it as the guide of life, before you can have recourse to it as the refuge of sorrow. You muff submit to its legislative authority, and experience ifs renewing influence, before you can look for its cdnfolatory effe&.
You muff -fecute the teftiritony dof -a goofl conscience, hnd 'peace with God through Jesus Christ; otherwife, when the floods /hall'come, and the rains defcenda and the woinds blow, tlhe houf6 which ydu had proposed for your retreat, shall prove the houfi founded on thefand, not on the rock."
"There are two plans, 'and tifere are but 'two, on which any aiah can propose to coridut himself through 'the dangers and distresses of human life. The oone is the plan of worldly wifdonr; tlie 'other, that -of determine 'idhereone to -conscience."
"He who gCLs upon -the former, lays prin.  xiple aside, and truits lhs defece .to his art and ability. .He avails himfglf of every advantage -which his knowledge 9f the world suggests. He attends to nothing but what he considers as his interest; and, unconfined .by cqpfcignce, pprfues it by every course ,which promises -him 4pccers. This planl, though too often adopted, will be found, on .trial, ineffeaual and deceitful. For hnuman ability is an unequal snatch for the violent .and unforeseen 'viciffitudes of the world. When these torrents rife in their might, they sweep away in a rnoynent the banks which worldly wisdom .had reared for ,dfense, and overwhelm 4alike .the .crafty sand the artless. IJ the mean time, perfops, this £.harader condemn themselves to Jive a snoft unquiet life. They (pass their days in perpetual anxiety, listening to every motion ; iartled by every-alarm; changiing their measures .on every new'Coccurrence; and when distress breaks .in over all their, defences, they are left under it, lopelefs and disconsolate."
"S  The'plan which; in opposition to this, "
", religion recommends, is both more ho nourable in itself, ahd more effeaual for security, is, at all hazards, to do your duty, and to leave the consequences to God. Let him who would aa upon this plan, adopt for the rule of his condua, that maxim of the Pfalmifl  Truf in the Lord, and do good *. To firm integrity, let him join a humble reliance oA God."
"Let his adherence to duty, encourage his religious trust. Let his religious trust, inspire him with fortitude in the performance of his duty. Let him know no path but the firaight and direa one. In the most critical moments of adion, let him ask no further questions, than What is the right, the fit, the worthy part?"
"How as a man, and as a Christian, it becomes him to ? Having received the decision of conscience, let him commit his *way unto the Lord. Let him, without trepidation or wavering, proceed in, difCharging his duty; resolved, that though the world may make him unfortunate, it thall never make him base; and confiding, that in wvhat God and his conscience re,uire him to aQt or fuffer, God and a good conscience will support him.-Such principles as these; are the best preparation for the vicissitudes of the human lot. They are the shield of inward peace. He who thinks and ats thus, fhallUbe exposed to no wounds but what religion can cure."

"# SERMON III. On the Influence of Religion upon Prosperity."
"## PSAL. i. 3. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doth shall prosper."
"On the Influence of RELIGION upon fle hall be like a tree planted by'the'rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf alfoJhall not wither, and whatsoever be doth Jall prosper."
"H happy influence of religion  . upon human life, in the time of adversity, has been considered in the preceding discourse. Concerning this the fentiments of men are more generally agreed, than with refpet to some other prerogatives which religion claims. They very readily assign to it the office of a Comforter. But as long as their state is profperous, they are apt to account it an unnecef fafy guest, perhaps an unwelcome intrtder."
"Let us not be thus unj'uft to religion, nor confine its importance to one period only in the life of -man. It was never intended to be merely the nurse of sickness, and thV tass of old age. I purpose now to show you, That it is no less essential to the enjoyment of prosperity, than to the comfort ofadverfity: That prosperity is prosperous, if we may -be allowed the expression, ,to a good man only; and that to every other person, it will prove, notwithfianding its fair appearance, a barren andjoylefs slate."
"The Psalmist, in the Text, by an image -taken from one of the most beautiful objedts in nature, describes a man who flouL 'rifhes in full prbfperity. But to whom is tfhe description limited ? To him, as the -preceding verses inform us, that walketh I'ot in the counsel of the ungodly, nor flandeth in the way of fJiners, nprjitteth in the feat of the fcorful, but hlIth his delight in the law of God. He only is like the -tree .planted by the rivers of water; whilst the odlyy, as he adds, are htotfon but, how  prosperous soever they may appear to the ' world, are in truth but like the chaf -which the wind driveth away. In confirmation of this doarine, I shall lay before you, some of those circumflances which diftinl guifh the prosperity of the good man bet yond that of the finner; and shall conclude, with pointing out the dangers and miseries, into which the latter is apt to be betrayed, by his favourable situation in the world."
"I. PIETY, and gratitude to God,. "
"tribute in a high degree to enliven profperity. Gratitude is a pleasing emotion."
"The sense of being diflinguifhed by the kindness of another, gladdens the heart, warms it with reciprocal affeaion, and gives to any poffeffion which is agreeable ,in itself, a double relish, from its being the gift of a friend, Favours conferred by men, I acknowledge, may prove but-denfome. For human virtue is never perse and sometimes unreasonable expectations on the one  sometimes a mortifying fenfq of dependence on the, other, "
"corrode in secret the pleasure of beriefitg, 1."
"'and convert the obligations of friendship ."
",into grounds of jealousy. Buit nothing of this kind can asset the'intercourfe of gratitude with Heaven. Its fav6urs are wholly disinterested ; , and with a gratitude the most cordial and unfufpicious, a good man looks up to that Almighty Benefator, who aims at no end but the happiness of those whom he blesses, and who desires no return from them but a devout and thankful *heart. While others can trace their profperity to no higher source than a concurrence of worldly causes, and, often, of mean or trifling incidents, which occafionally favoured their designs; with what fuperiour satisfaction edoes the servant of God jreniark the hand of. that gracious Power, which hath raised him up; -which hath happily conduaed him through the various fleps of life, and crowned him with the most favourable diftinaion beyond his equals ?"
"Let us farther confider,: that not only gratitude for the past, but a chearing sense ER  Qs God favour at the present, enters into Sthe pious emotion, They are only the virtuous, who in their profpermua days hear this voice addressed to them; Ga bhy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry hearl ; for God now acceptetb thy 'works- . He who is the Author of their prosperity, gives, them a title to enjoy, with complacency, his own gift. While bad men snatch the pleasures of the world as by flealth, without counter narce from God the proprietor of the world; the righteous fit openly down  the feast of life, under the fmiile of approving Heaven. No guilty fears damp their joys. The blessing of God rests upoa all that they poffeffs; his prote&ion flprr rounds them; and hence, in the habitations of the righteous, is found the voics of rejoicing and falvatien. A luthe unknowa to others, invefte, in their fight, the whole face of nature. Their piety refle a funshine from heavep upon the prosperity of the world unites in one point of view, "
"- Eccles. ix. 7 the the smiling afpet, both of the powers ht  above, and of the objets below. Not I only have they as full a relish as others, of the innocent pleasures of life, but, moreover, ir these they hold communion with God. In all that is good or fair, they trace his hand. From the beauties of nature, from the improvements of art, from the ernjoyments of social life, they raise their affedion to the source of all the happiness which furtounds them; and thus widen the sphere of their pleasures, by adding intelleetual, and spiritual, to earthly joys."
"For illustration of what I have said on this head, remark that chearful enjoyment of a prosperous state which King David had, when he wrote the twenty-third Vfalm; and compare the highest pleasures of the riotous finner, with the happy and satisfied spirit which breathes throughout that Pfalm.-In the midst of the splendour of royalty, with what amiable simplicity of gratitude does he took up to the Lord as Ms Shepherd; happier in ascribing all his success to divine favour, than to the policy of his counsels, or to 'the force of his III. armis! How mnany inflances of divine goodness arose before him in pleasing rec membrance, -when with such relish he speaks of the green paflures and fill Iwater4 bejide which God, had led him ; of his cup which he hath made to overflow ; and of the table which he hath prepared for him in presence of his enemies .! With what perset tranquillity does he look forward to the time of his passing through the valley of. the jhadowvf death.; i nappalled by that .Spetre, whose most distant appear-,"
"prce blasts the prosperity ds sinners ! He fears no evil, as long as the r9d and the flaffof his Divine Shepherd are with him;'"
"and,, through all the. unknowr periods of this and of -a future existence, commits himself to his guidance with secure and triumphant hope. , Surely goodness and percy Jhall fqllow me all the days of my ife ; and I will dwell in the hose of the Lord for ever.-What a purified, sentimental enjoyment. of. prosperity,. is here .exhibited! How different from that gross relilh of worldly pleasures, which belongs to thbfe who behold only the terrefirial of tlings; who raise their views to no higher objeCs than the succession of human contingencies, and the weak efforts of human ability; who have no proteCtor or patron in the heavens, to enliven their prosperity, or to warm their hearts with gratitude and trust!"
"II. RELIGION affords to good men pe culiar security in the enjoyment of their prosperity. One of the first reflections which muff strike every thinking man, aster his situation in the world has become agreeable, is, That the continuance of such a situation is most uncertain. From a variety of causes, he lies open to change."
"On many sides he fees that he may be pierced;- and the wider his comforts extend, the broader is the mark which he spreads to the arrows of misfortune. Hence many a secret alarm to the reflecting mind; and to those who rejet all such alarms, the real danger increases, in proportion to their improvident security."
"By worldly assistance it is vain to think of providing any effeaual defence, feeing the world mutability is the very cause of our terrour. It is from a higher principle, from a power fuperiour to the world, that relief must be fought, amidift such difquietudes of the heart. He who in his profperity can look up to One who is witness to his moderation, humanity, and charity; he who can appeal to Heaven, that he has not been elated by pride, nor overcome by pleasure, but has studied to employ itq gifts to the honour of the giver; this man, if there be any truth in religion, if there be any benignity or goodness in the administration of the universe, has just cause for encouragement and hope. Not that an interest in the Divine grace will perpetuate to a good man, more than to others, a life of unruffled prosperity."
"Change and alteration form the very esfence of the world. But let the world change around him at pleasure, he has ground to hope that it shall not be able to make him unhappy. Whatever may vary, "
"God providence is fitll the fame; and his love to the righteous remains unaltered. -"
"If it shall be the Divine will to remove one comfort, he trusts that some other fiall be given. Whatever is given, whatever is taken away he confides, that in the last result allfhall work for his good."
"Hence, he is not disturbed, like bad men, by the inflability of the world."
"Dangers, which overcom8 others, ihake not his more steady mind. He enjoys the pleasures of life pure and unallayed, because he enjoys them, as long as they last, without anxious terrours. They are not his all, his only good. He welcomes them when they arrive; and when they pass away, he can eye them, as they depart, without agony or despair. His profperity firikes a deeper and firmer root than that of the ungodly. And for this reason he is compared,.in the Text, to a tree planted by the rivers of water ; a tree, whose branches the tempest may indeed bend, but whose roots it cannot touch; a tree, which may occasionally be firipped  of its leaves and blossoms, but which still . . maintains its place, and in due season flou."
"rifhes a-new. Whereas the finner' in his prosperity, according to the allusion in the -book of Jab, resembles the rujh that groweth up in the mire *; a slender reed, that may flourish green for a while by the of the brook, as long as it is cherilhed by the fun, and fanned by the breeze; till the first bitter blast breaks its feeble stem, roots it out from its bed, and lays it in -the duff.

"III. RELIGION forms good men to the most proper temper for the enjoyment of prosperity. A little refleaion may satisfy us, that mere poffeffion, even granting it to be secure, does not conflitute enjoyment."
"Give a man all that is in the power of the world to bestow; surround him with riches; crown him with honours; invest him, if you will, with absolute dominion; but leave him at the .fame time under some SE RIt cret opprelfion ot heaviness of heart; your beflow indeed the materials of enjoymeht, but you deprive him of ability to ,extra~&"

"rode but one of his smallest nerves; and you shall prefenfly fee all his gaiety vanifh; you shall hear him complain, that he is a miserable creature, and express his envy of the peasant and the cottager.-"
"And can you believe, that a disease in the foul is less fatal to enjoyment, than a difease in the animal frame; or that a found mind is not as essential, as a found body, to the prosperity of man ?-Let us rate sensual gratifications as higlt as we please, "
"IIm. we bhall be made to feel that the feat of enjoyment is in'the foul., The corrupted temper, and thie guilty passions of the bad, fruftrat6 the effe6 of every advantage which the world confers on them. The world may call them men of pleasure, but of all men they are the greatest foes to pleasure. From their eagerhefs to grasp, -they firangle and destroy it. None but the temperate, the regular, and the virtuous, know how to enjoy^profperity."
"They bring to its comforts the manly relifh of a found uncorrupted mind. They flop at the proper point, before enjoyment legenerates into disgust, and pleaiure is converted into pain. They are stranger4 to those complaints which flow from spleen, paprice, and all the fantastical distresses of a vitiated mind. While riotous indulgence enervate§ both the body and the mind, purity and virtue heighten all the powers of human fruition. Moderate and simple pleasures relish high with the temperate; in the midst of his studied refinements, the voluptuary languilhes."
"Wherever guilt mingles with prosperity, "
"a certain gloom and heaviness enter along with it. Vitious intrigues never fail to entangle and embarrass those who engage in them. But innocence confers ease and freedom on the mind; leaves it open to every pleasing sensation; gives a lightness to the spirits, similar to the native gaiety of youth and health; ill imitated, and ill supplied, by that forced levity of the viti."
"ous, which arises not from the health, but from the drunkenness of the mind."
"Feeble are all pleasures in which the heart has no part. The felfifh gratifications of the bad, are both narrow in theiri circle, and short in their duration. But prosperity is redoubled to a good man, by his generous use of it. It is refleted back upon him from every one whom he makes happy.

"xity of good men, by the. profpeC which it affords them of greater happiness to come in another world. I showed, in the foregoing discourse, the mighty effea of the hope of Heaven, in relieving the mitid .under the troubles of life.

What is present, is never fufficient to give us.full fatisfa&ion. To the present we muff always join some agreeable anticipations of futurity, in order to complete our pleasure. What an accession then muff the prosperity of the righteous man receive, when, born with a fmobth and gentle gale along the current of life, and looking round on all the blessings of his slate, he can confider these as no more than an introducion to higher scenes which are hereafter to open; he can view his present life, as only the 0 ER  porch through which he is to pats into the IlL Spalace of bliss; and his present joys, as but a feeble stream, dispensed for his occa'"

"It is the fate of all human pleasures, by continuance, to fade; of most of them, to cloy. Hence, in the most prosperous state, there are frequent intervals'.of languor, and even of dejetion. There are vacuities in the happiest life, which it is not in the power of the world to fill up, What relief so adapted to those vacant oir dejeaed periods, as the pleasing hopes which arise from immortality ? How barref and imperfec that prosperity, whichl can have tecourfe to no such tubfidiary SE "
"comfort, in order to animate the ftagna- I of vulgar life, and to supply the in."
"fufficiency of worldly pleasure !"
"Worldly prosperity declines with  dining life. In youth its relish was brisk and poignant. It becomes more sober as life advances; and flattens as life descends. He who lately overflowed with chearful spirits and high hopes, begins to look back with heaviness on the days of foater years. He thinks of his old companions, who are gone; and re*
views-paft scenes, more agreeable than any which ate likely to return. The adtivity of pursuit is weakened. The gaiety of 4mufement is fled. The gratifications of sense languish. When his accuflomed pleasures, one after another, thus fleal treacherously away, what can he, who is an utter fttanger to religion, and to the hope of heaven, substitute in their place ?
--But even in that drooping period, the promises and hopes of religion support the spirits of a good man till the latest i, hour. His leaf, it is said in the Text, 
li ]Jiall not wither, It thall not be in thb power of time to blast his prosperity But old age shall receive him into a quieg rel~eat, where, if lively sensations fail, gentle pleasures remain to sooth him.
That hope of immortality, which formerly improved his other enjoyments, pow in a great measure supplies their ibfence. Its importance rises, in proportion as its obr jeat draws near. He is not forsaken by:
the world, but retires from it with dignity; xeviewing with a calm mind the part which he has aaed, and trufling to the promise of God for an approaching reward. Such sentiments adl expetations shed a pleasing tranquillity over the old age of the righteous man. They make the evening of his days go down unclouded; and allow the fiream of life, though fallen low, to run clear to the last drop.

THUS I have shown, I hope, with full evidence, what material ingredients religion and a good conscience are in the pro 
fperity of life. Separated from them, 


prosperity, how fair soever it may feent to the world, is insipid, nay, frequently ioxious to the poffeffor: United with them, it rises into a real blessing bestowed by God upon man. God giveth to a man that is good in his fght, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the fnner he giveth fore travel, to gather, and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God*.

ALLOW me now to conclude the sub je6, with representing to the prosperous pen of the world, those crimes and miseries into which the abuse of their condition is likely to betray them, and calling upon them to beware of the dangers with which they are threatened.

It is unfortunate for mankind, that those situations which favour pleasure, are too generally adverse to virtue. Virtue requires internal government and discipline; prosperity relaxes the mind, and inflames the passions. Virtue is supported by a  regard to what is future; prosperity at taches us wholly to what is present. The charaaeriflicks of virtue, are tnodefly and humility; the most common attendants of prosperity, are pride and presumption.
One should think, that prosperity would prove the strongest incitement to remember and to honour that God who beftows it.
Yet such is the perverseness of human na, ture, that it proves much oftener the motive to impiety. The changes of the world call the attention of men to an Invifible Power. But a train of events proceeding according to their with, leads them to nothing beyond what they fee.
The Supreme Giver is concealed from view by his own gifts. This inflance of success they ascribe to a fortunate concurrence of worldly causes; that acquisition, to their own flill and industry; unmindful of him, who from the beginning arranged that series of causes, and who placed them in circumitances where their industry could operate with success. From forgetting God, they too often proceed to despise him.

All that is light or giddy in their minds,  is fpt in motion by the gale of prosperity.
Arrogance and felf-fufficiency are lifted up; and their state is considered, as fecured by their own firength. Hence that pride of countenance, through which the wicked, in their prosperity, as David observes, refuse tofeek after God. They are described as speaking loftily, and setting their mouth againfj the Heavens. They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the found of the organ; and they fay unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. What is the Al..
mighty, that we should serve him? Or what profit Jfould we have, if twe pray unto him ?

They fay unto God, Depart from us.-.

What an impious voice! Could we haire believed it possible, that worldly pleafures should so far intoxicate any human heart ? Wretched and infatuated men !
Have you ever examined on what your confidence refls ?-You'have said in your hearts, You Jhall never be moved; you fancy yourselves placed on a mountain  which flandeth frong.

No mighty effort, no long preparation of events, is needed to overturn your prosperity. By flow degrees it rose. Long time, much labour, and the concurrence of many assisting causes, were necessary to rear it up; but one flight incident can entirely overthrow it. Suspicions areinfused into the patron or the prince aon whom you depend; and your disgrace ensues. Exercise, or amusement, kindles a fever in the veins of those whom you loved; and you are robbed of your comforts and hopes. A few grains of sand lodge themselves within you; and the reft of your life is disease- and misery."

"# SERMON  On our Imperfect Knowledge of a Future State."

"T HE Apostle here describes the im- "

"tors have rendered by feeing them darkly that is, the truth in part discovered, in part concealed, and placed beyond our This description, however just and true, "
"cannot fail to occasion some perplexity to an enquiring mind. For it may seem ftrainge, that so much darkness should be left upon those celestial objets, towards which we are at the fame time commanded to aspire. We are strangers in the universe of God. Confined to that' spot on which we dwell, we are permitted to know nothing of what is tranfading in the regions above us and around us. By much labour, we acquire a superficial acquaintance with a few sensible objetas which we find in our present habitation; hut we enter, and we depart, under a total ignorance of the nature and laws of the spiritual world. One fubjea particular, when our thoughts proceed in thisi train, muff often recur upon the mind with peculiar anxiety; that is, the importality of the foul, and the future state of man. Exposed as we are at present to such variety of affliiions, and fubjeaed to to inuch disappointment in all our pur- I."
"ftits of happiness, Why, it may be said, . I las our gracious Creator denied us the consolation of a full discovery of our future existence, if indeed such an existence be prepared for us ?--Reason, it is true, suggests many arguments in behalf of immortality: Revelation gives full affurance of it. Yet even that Gospel which is said to have brought life and immortality to light, allows us to fee only through a glass darkly. It doth not yet appear what we Jhall be. Our knowledge of a future world, is very imperfect our ideas of it, are faint and confused. It is not displayed in such a manner, as to make an impreflion suited to the importance of the objedt."
"The faith even of the best men, is much inferiour, both in clearness ahd in force, to the evidence of sense; and proves, on many occasions, infufficient to counterbalance the temptations of the present world."
"Happy moments indeed there fometimesl are in the lives of pious men, when fequeftered from worldly cares, and born up  on the wings of divine contemplation, they rife to a near and transporting view of immortal glory. But such efforts, of the inind are rare, and qannot be .long sup.,"
"ported. When the spirit of meditatiop subsides, this lively sense of a future state decays ; and though the general belief of it remain, yet even good men,. when they return to the ordinary business and cares of life, seem to rejoin the multitude, and to re-affume the fame hopes, and fears, and interefls, which influence, the reft of the world."
"SFrom such refleaions,. a considerable, difficulty rerpeding this important subje&, either arises, or seems to arise. Was such an obscure and imperfec discovery of another life worthy to proceed from God ?'"
"Does it not afford some ground, either to tax his goodness, or to fufpec the evidence of its coming from him ?-This is, the point which we are now to confider;."
"and let us confider it with that close attention which the fubjet merits. Let us en:-."
"quire, whether we Lave any reason, ei !ther to complain of Pr6vidence, or to ob- 4 ER "
".jer to the evidence of a future slate, 'because that evidence is not of a more fenfi1 ble and firiking nature. .Let us 'attempt humbly to trace the reasons, why, though permitted to know and to fee somewhat of the eternal world, we are nevertheless permitted only. to know in part, and to fee through a glass, darkly."
"IT plainly appears to be the plan of the Deity, in all his difpenfations, to mix light with darkness, evidence with uncertainty. Whatever the reasons of this procedure be, the fat is undeniable. He is described in the Old Testament, as a God that hideth himself*. Clouds and darkness, are said tofurround him. His way is in the sea, and his path in the great waters; his footfleps are not known. Both the works:"
"and the ways of God are full of mystery."
"In the ordinary course of his government, innumerable events occur which perplex:"
"us to the utmost. There is a certain limit t6 all our enquiries in religion, beyond I which if we attempt to proceed, we are loft in a maze of inextricable difficulties."
"Even that revelation which affords fucl material inftrudion to man, concerning his duty and his happiness, leaves many doubts unresolved. Why it was not given sooner; why not to all men; why there flould be so many things in it hard to be underflood, are difficulties not inconsiderable, in the midst of that incontestable evidence by which it is supported. If, then, the future state of man be not placed in so full and clear a light as we desire, this is no more than what the analogy of all religion, both natural and revealed, gave us reason to expe&."
"But such a solution of the difficulty will be thought imperfet. It may, perhaps, not give much fatisfa&ion, to show that all religion abounds with difficulties of a like nature. Our situation, it will be said, isfo much the more to be lamented, that not on one only we are confined in our enquiries, but on all hands environed with nyfltrious oblcurity.-Let us then, if so sti "
"much diffatisfied with our condition, give "
"fcppe for once to Fancy, and confider how the plan of Providence might be retified to our with. Let us call upon the Scepick, and desire him to fay, what measure of information would afford him entire fatisfadion."
",This, he will tell us, requires not any long or deep deliberation. He desires only to have his view enlarged beyond the limits of this corporeal slate. Instead of refling upon evidence which requires difcuflion, which must be supported by much reafoping, and which, after all, he alleges yields very imperfed information, he demands the everlasting mansions to be so displayed, if in truth such mansions there be, as to place faith on a level with the evidence of sense. What noble and happy effeas, he exclaims, would inflantly follow, if man thus beheld his present and his future existence at once before him !"
"He would then become worthy of his rank in the creation. Infiead of being the sport; as now, of degrading passions and childild SIv, attachments, he would solely on the principles of immortality. His'purfuit of virtue would be steady; his life would be undiflurbed and happy.

"Were the celestial glory exposed to out admiring view; did the angelic harmony found in our enraptured ears; what earthly concerns could have the power of engaging our attention for a single moment ?

"by which we are at present flimulated, would cease to operate. Human life would present no objets fufficient to rouse the mind; to kindle the spirit of enterprize, or to urge the hand of in*"

How far the change would contribute to his welfare, comes to be considered.

If there be any principle fully afcer tained by religion, it is, That this life was intended for a state of trial and improve'ment to man. His preparation for a better world required a gradual purification, carried on. by fleps of progressive difcipline. The situation, therefore, here assigned him, was such as to answer this design, by calling forth all his aaive powers, by giving full scope to his moral dispositions, and bringing to light his whole characer. Hence it became proper, that difficulty and temptation should arise in the pourfe of his duty. Ample rewards were promised to virtue ; but these rewards were left, as yet, in obscurity and distant profped. The impreflions of  sense were so balanced against the dnfco  ' veries of immortality, as to allow a con fiia between faith and sense, between conscience and desire, between present pleasure and future good. In this confli6t the fouls of good men are tried, improved, and strengthened. In this field, their honours are reaped. Here ate formed the capital virtues of fortitude, temperance, and felf-denial; moderation in prosperity, patience in adversity, sub4iiffion to the will of God, and charity and forgivcnefs to men, amidst the various competitions of worldly interest.

Such is the plan of Divine wisdom for tnan improvement. But put the cafe, that the plan devised by human wisdom were to take place, and that the rewards of the just were to be now fully displayed to view; the exercise of all those graces which I have mentioned, would be entirely superseded. Their very names would be unknown. Every temptation being withdrawn, every worldly attachment being subdued by the overpowering dif 
coveries of eternity, no trial of incerity, EM.


no dlfcrimination of characers, would re, main; no opportunity would be afforded for those aCtive exertions, which are the means of purifying and perfeaing the good. On the competition between time and eternity, depends the chief exercise of human virtue. The obscurity which at present hangs over eternal obje  preserves the competition. Remove that ob.
fcurity, and you remove human virtue from its place. You overthrow that whole system of discipline, by which imperfe& creatures are, in this life, gradually trained up for a more perse& state.

This, then, is the conclusion to which at last we arrive, That the full display which was demanded, of the heavenly glory, would be so far from improving the human foul, that it would abolish those virtues and duties which are the great instruments of its improvement. It would be unsuitable to the chara&er of man in every view, either as an acive being, or a moral agent. It would dif 
 qualify him for taking part in the affairs - of the world; for relishing the pleasures, 
or for discharging the duties of life: In a word, it would entirely defeat the purpose of his being placed on this earth.
And the question, Why the Almighty has been pleased to leave a spiritual world, and the future existence of man, under so much obscurity, resolves in the end into this, Why there should be fuch'a creature as man in the universe of God ?-
Such is the issue of the improvements proposed to be made on the plans of Providence. They add to the discoveries of the fuperiour wisdom of God, and. of the presumption and folly of man.

FROM what has been said, it now ap pears, That no reasonable obje6tion to the belief of a future Rate arises, from the imperfe discoveries of it which we enjoy; from the difficulties that are mingled with its evidence; from our feeing as through a glass darkly, and being left to ,walk by faith and not by fight. It cannot be otherwise, it ought not to be other- 


wife, in our present state. The evidence which is afforded, is fufficient for the conviaion of a .candid mind, fufficient for a rational ground of conduCt; though not so firiking as to withdraw our attention from the present world, or altogether to overcome the impression of fenfible obje6s. In such evidence it becomes us to acquiesce, without indulging either doubts or complaints, on account of our not receiving all the fatisfation which we fondly desire, but which our present immaturity of being excludes. For upon the supposition of immortality, this life is no other than the childhood of existence; and the measures of our knowledge must be proportioned to such a state. To the successive flages of human life, from infancy to old! age, belong certain peculiar attachments, certain cares, desires, and interests; which open not abruptly, but by gradual advances on the mind, as it becomes fit to receive them, and is prepared for ading the part to which, in  their order, they pertain. Hence, in the.


, , education of a child, no one thinks of in spiring him all at once with the know.
ledge, the sentiments, and views of a man, and with contempt for the exer.
cifes and amusements of childhood. On the contrary, employments suited to his age are allowed to occupy him. By these his powers are gradually unfolded; and advantage is taken of his youthful pursuits, to improve and firengthen his mind; till, flep by step, he is led on to higher profpeds, and prepared for a larger and more important scene of adion.

This analogy, which so happily illus trates the present condu6t of -the Deity towards man, deserves attention the more, as it is the very illustration used by the Apofile, when treating of this fubjea in the context. Now, says he, we know in part--ut when that which is perfed is come, that which is in part Jhall be done away. When I was a child, 1 spake as 4 child, I underfood as a child, I thought as 4 Child i but when I became a man, I put away childi things. For now we fee ER  

through a glass, darkly ; but then, face to face: Now I know in part; but then, I Jhall know even as I am known. Under the care of the Almighty, our education is now going on, from a mortal to an immortal state. As much light is let in upon us, as we can, bear without injury.
When the objets become too splendid and dazzling for our fight, the curtain is drawn. Exercised in such a field of adion, as suits the strength of our unripened powers, we are, at the fame time by proper profpeas and hopes, prompted to aspire towards the manhood of our nature, the time when childih thingsJhall be put away. But fRill, between those future profpeas, and the impression of present objets, such an accurate proportion is established, as on the one hard ihall not produce a total contempt of earthly things, while we aspire to those that are heavenly; and on the other, shall not encourage such a degree of attachment to our present slate, as would ER  render us unworthy of future advanceL ment. In a word, the whole course of things is so ordered, that we may neither by an irregular and precipitate education, become lyen too soon; nor by a fond and trifling indulgence, be (uffered to continue children for ever, 
LET these refletions not only remove the doubts which may arise from our obscure knowledge of immortality, but likewise produce the highest admiration of the wisdom of our Creator. The ftructure of the natural world affords innumerable instances of profound design, which no attentive fpedator can survey without wonder. In the moral world, where the workmanship is of much finer and more delicate contexture, fubjets of flill greater admiration open to view. But admiration muff rife to its -Jigheft point, when those parts of the moral conflitution, which at first were reptted blemifhes, which carried the appearance of objecions, either to the wisdom or the goodness of Providence, are discovered,  

on more accurate infpetion, to be adjufted with the most exquisite propriety.
We have now seen, that the darkness of man condition is no less essential to his well-being, than the light which he enjoys. His internal powers, and his external situation, appear to be exaaly fitted to each other. Those complaints which we are apt to make, of our limited capacity and narrow views, of our inability tQ penetrate farther into the future destination of man, are found, from the foregoing observations, to be just as unreasonable, as the childish complaints of our not being formed with a microscopic eye, nor furnifhed with an eagle wing that is, of not being endowed with powers which would subvert the nature, and countera&
the laws, of our present slate.

In order to do justice to the fubjed, I must observe, That the fame reasoning which has been now employed with refpe6 to our knowledge of immortality, is'
equally applicable to many other branches SE  of intelleaual knowledge. Thus, why weý are permitted to know so little of the nature of that Eternal Being who rules the universe; why the manner in which he operates on the natural and moral world, is wholly concealed; why we are kept An such ignorance, with refpe£; to the extent of his works, to the nature and agency of spiritual beings, and even with refpet to Sthe union between our own foul and body:
To all these, and several other enquiries of the fame kind, which often employ the solicitous researches of speculative men, the answer is the fame that was given to the interesting question which makes- the subje& of our discourse. The degree of knowledge desired, would prove incompatible with the design, and with the proper bufiness of this life. It would raise us to a sphere too exalted; would reveal obje6ts too great and striking for ourprefent faculties; would excite feelings too strong for us to bear; in a word, would unfit us for thinking or ading like human creatures.
It is therefore reserved for a more 
vanced period of our nature; and the hand of Infinite wisdom hath in mercy drawn a .
veil over scenes which would overpower the fight of mortals.

One inflance, in particular, of Divine wisdom, is Mo illustrious, and corresponds so remarkably with our present fubjet, that I cannot pass it over without notice; that is, the concealment under which Pro,vidence has placed the future events of our life on earth. The desire of penetrating into this unknown region, has ever been one of the most anxious passions of men. It has often seized the wife as well as the credulous, and given rife to many vain and impious superstitions throughout the whole earth. Burning with curiosity at the approach of some critical event, and impatient under the perplexity of conjecture and doubt, How cruel is Providence, we are apt to exclaim, in denying to man the power of fore fight, and in limiting him to the knowledge of the present moment ? Were he permitted to look forward intP the course of destiny, how much more  suitably would he be prepared for the vari, 
ous turns and changes in his life ? With what moderation would he enjoy his profperity, under the fore-knowledge of an approaching reverse ? And with what eagernefs be prompted to improve tte flying hours, by feeing the inevitable term draw nigh which was to finish his course ?

But while Fancy indulges such vain fires and criminal complaints, this coveted fore-knowledge must clearly appear to the eye of reason, to be the most fatal gift which the Almighty could bestow. If in this present mixed slate, all the successive scenes of distress through which we are to pass, were laid before ps in ore view, perpetual sadness would overcast our life.
Hardly would any transient gleams of intervening joy be able to force their way through the cloud, Faint would be the relish of pleasures, of which we foresaw the close : Insupportable the burden of asflitions, under which we were oppressed by a load, not only of present, but of anticipated foTrows. Friends would begin their union, with lamenting the day which  was to dissolve it; and, with weeping eye, the parent would every moment behold the child whom he knew that he was to lose. In short, as soon as that mysterious veil, which now covers futurity, was lifted up, all the gaiety of life would difappear; its flattering hopes, its pleating illusions, would vanifi; and nothing but its vanity and sadness remain. The forefight of the hour of death would continually interrupt the course of human asfairs; and the overwhelming prospect of the future, instead of exciting men to proper aaivity, would render them immoveable with consternation and dismay..--
How much more friendly to man is that mixture of knowledge and ignorance which is allotted him in this state 1 Ignorant of the events which are to befall us, and of the precise term which is to conclude our life, by this ignorance our enjoyment of present objeas is favoured; and knowing that death is certain, and that human affairs are full of change, by  this knowledge our attachment to those ob je6s is moderated. Precisely in the fame manner, as, by the mixture of evidence and obscurity which remains on the prosped of a future state, a proper balance is preserved between our love of this life, and our desire of a better. '

The longer that our thoughts dwell oa this fubjet, the more we must be con.
vinced, that in nothing the Divine wisdom is more admirable, than in proportioning knowledge to the necessities of man, Inflead of lamenting our condition, that we are permitted only tofee as through a glass darkly, we have reason to bless our Creator, no less for what he hath concealed, than for what he hath allowed us to know. He is wonderful in counsel, as he is excellent in working. He is wife in heart, and his thoughts are deep. How unfearchabie are the riches of the wisdom of the knowledge of God!"
"FROM the whole vievi which we have taken of the subjeCt, this important in "
"firution arises, That the great design of "
"all the knowledge, and in particular of the religious knowledge which God hath asforded us, is, to fit us for discharging the duties of life. No useless discoveries are made to us in religion: No discoveries even of useful truths, beyond the precise degree of information, which is fubfervient to right conduc. To this great end all our information points. In this center all the lines of knowledge meet. Life and immortality are brought to light in the gofpel, yet not so displayed as to gratify the curiosity of the world with an astonishing fpedacle; but only so far made known, as to assist and support us in the pratice of our duty. If the discovery were more imperfet, it would excite no desire of immortality; if it were more full and firiking, it would render us careless of life."
"On the first supposition, no fufficient motive to virtue would appear; on the second, no proper trial of it would remain. In the one cafe, we should think and aft like men who have their portion only in this world;  in the other cafe, like men, who have nO concern with this world at all, Whereas now, by the wife conflitution of Heaven, we are placed in the most favourable fitua."
"tion for aaing, with propriety, our allotted part here; and for rising, in due course, to higher honour and happiness hereafter."
"Let us then second the kind intentions of Providence, and at upon the plai which it hath pointed out. Checking our inquisitive solicitude about what tJe Almighty hath concealed, let us dili, gently improve what he hath made knowti Inhabitants of the earth, we are at the fame time candidates for heaven. ' Look."
"ing upon there as only different views of one consistent charader, let us carry on our preparation for heaven, not by abftraaing ourselves from the concerns of this world, but by fulfilling the duties and offices of every station in life. Living soberly, righteously, and godly in the present *world, let us look for that ble/Jd hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Chrjfl."
"3Before I conclude, it may be proper to ER RT observe, That the reasonings in this I course give no ground to apprehend any danger of our being too much influenced by the belief of a future state. have shown the hurtful effects which would follow from too bright and full a discovery of the glory of that state; and in showing this, I have justified the decree of Providence, which permits no such discovery."
"But as our nature is at present constituted, attached by so many firong connections to the world of sense, and enjoying a communication so feeble and distant with the world of spirits, we need fear no danger from cultivating intercourse with the latter as much as possible. On the contrary, from that intercourse the chief security of our virtue is to be fought. The biafs of our nature leans so much towards sense, that from this the peril is to be dreaded, and on this the defence is to be provided."
"Let us then walk by faith. Let us firengthen this principle of ation to the ltmoft of our pbwer.. Let implore the Divirib grate -to firerigthen it withii~ ti more and more: That wve may thence deL itve An aritidote against that flbtile poifdd, which incessant cotiitnetce with the bbjeah of fenfd diffufes through our fouls i that we may hence acquire pHflty ahd dignity of manners, suited to our divifde hoped'"
"and, undefilkd by the pleasures 6f th6 world, unfhakpr by itS tekrodfr, may preserve to the end one cotiftant tenor itegrity. Till At last, having, urndei the cond'uft of Christian faith, happily finiihed the period of discipline, we enter on tiat ftRaie, Where A far hobler fcerie hMAl opefd; vhere eternal objeas flall fhihe in their native splendour; where, thiS twilight of moral life being past, the Suit ofrighteoufhess shall rife; and that which if perfeft being come, that wvhich is in part fJall be done awvay.

# SERMON  On the Death of Christ.

## JOHN xvii. I. Jesus lift up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father! The hour is come On the DEATH of CHRIST4 Preached at the celebration of the SACRAMEfT of the LORD SuppEg.



efuf lift up his eyes to heaven, and faidi Father I The hour is come ;-
 HESE were the words of our blessed Lord on a memorable occa- 

sion. The feast of the passover drew nigh, at which he knew that he was to fuffer.
The night was arrived wherein he was to be delivered into-the hands of his ene.
mies.  had spent the evening in conference with his disciples; like a dying father in the midst of his family; mingling consolations with his last inftruc 

tions. When he had ended his discourse  to them, he lifted uphis eyes to bhaven, 
and, with the words which I have now read, began that solemn prayer of intercession for the Church, which closed his ministry. Immediately after, he went forth with'his disciples into the garden of Gethsemane, and surrendered himself to those who came to apprehend him.

Such was the situation of our Lord at the time of his pronouncing there words.
He saw his mission on the point of being accomplished. He had the profpea full before him, of all that he was about to fuffer.-Father! The hour is come.-What hohr ? An hour the most critical, the molt pregnant with great events, since hours had begun to be numbered, since time had begun to run. It was the hour in which the Son of God was to terminate the labours of his important life, by a death still more important and illuftrious ; the hour of atoning, by his fufferings, for the guilt of mankind; the hour of accomplishing prophecies, types, and symbols, which had be'en carried on through a series of ages; the hour of ' '
cluding the old, and of introducing to the world the new dispensation of religion; the hour of his triumphing over the world, and death, and hell; the hour of his eaing that spiritual kingdom which is to last for ever. Such is the hour, such are the events, which you are to commemorate in the Sacrament of our Lord Supper. I thall attempt to set them before you as proper fubjeas, at this time, of your devout meditation. To display them in their genuine majefly, is beyond the ability of man.

I. THIS was the hour in which Christ was glorified by his fufferings. The whole of his life had discovered much real greatness, under a mean appearance.
Through the cloud of his humiliation, his native lustre often broke, forth; but never did it ihine so bright, as in this last, this trying hour. It was indeed the hour of distress, and of blood. He knew it to , ER  bg such; and when he uttered the words  of jhe Text, he had before his eyes, the executioner and the cross, the scourge, the nails, and the spear. But by profpeds of this .nature his foiu was not to be over.
come. It is distress which ennobles every great charaacer; and distress was to glo, rify the Son of God. He was pow to teach all mankind, by his exampJe, how to fuffer and to die. He was to fland forth before his enemies, as the faithful witness of the truth; jultifying by his behavioir the charader which he assumed, and sealing with his blood the dodtrine which he taught."
"What magnanimity in all his words and ations on this great occafioo! The court of Herod, the judgement-hall of Pilate, the hil of Calvary, were fb pany -theatres prepared for his displaying all the virtues of a constant and patient mind."
"When led forth to fuffer, the first voice which we hear from him, is a generous lamentation over the fate of his unfortupate, though guilty, country; and, to the last noment of his jife, we 1ehol4 hip.in poffeffiop of the faap gentle and benevolept spirit, No upbraiding, 09 cqpnplaining expression escaped from his lips, during the long and painful approaches of a ,rPl death. He betrayed no symptom qs a weal or a vulgar, of a difcoxmgfed or impatient mind. tjt the utmqpt tttpntjai of filial tepderrefs, he committed his aged mother to the care of hi* beloved disciple *. With all jhe dignity of a SoYereign, ,he coiferred pardon qn a pei ;ent fellow-fufferer. With a greatness of Piqid beyond example, he spent his, last niqrments in apologies and prayers, for lhofe who were tEedding his blood."
"lýy ,wonders in heaven, and wonders on earth, was this hour distinguished, All nature seemed to feel it ; and the degd and the living bore witness to its importance, The reil of the temple was rent in twain."
"The earth shook. There was darkness over all the land. The graves were opened, and many whoflept arose and went into *See John xix. 26, 27, "
"the Holy City. Nor were these the only  prodigies of this awful hour. The most hardened hearts were subdued and changed. The Judge, who in order to gratify the multitude passed sentence against him, publickly attested his innocence. The Roman centurion, who presided at the execution, glorifed God, and acknowledged the fufferer to be more than man. After he saw the things which had pafed, he said, Certainly this was a righteous perfoi ; truly, this was the Son of God. The Jewish malefador who was crucified with him, addressed him as a King, and implored his favour, Even the crowd of insensible fpeftators, who had come forth as to a common fpedacle, and who began with clamours and insults, returned home, smiting their breafs.-Look back on the heroes, the philosophers, the legislators of old. View them in their last moments."
"Recall every circumstance which diftinguifled their departure from the world."
"Where can you find such an assemblage of high virtues, and of great events, as con curred at the death ofChrift? Where, fb "
"many teflimonies given to the dignity of  the dying person, by earth, 'and by heaven ?"
"II. THIS was the hour in which Christ atoned for the fins of mankind, ind accomplifhed our eternal redemption. It was the hour when that great sacrifice was offered up, the efficacy of which reaches back to the first transgression of man, and extends forward to the end of time; the hour when, from the cross, as from an high altar, that blood was flowing, which washed away the guilt of the nations."
"This awful dispensation of the Al mighty, contains mysteries which are beyond the discovery of ,man. It is one of those things into which the angels desire to look. What has been revealed to us, is, That the death of Christ was the interpofition of Heaven for preventing the ruin of human kind. We know, that under the government of God, misery is the natural consequence of guilt. After rational ER  preaturts had, by their criminal condu&~"
". - introduced difpr4pe iito the Divine kingr dorp, there waq no ground to believe, tha4 by their penitence and prayers alone, they could prevent the deftrution which threateped them. The prevalence of propitiatory a[crifices throughout Ihp earth, proclaims it to be the general sense of mankind, that mere repentance was not of fufficient avail to expiate fin, or ;Q (lop its pepal effeas. By the conflant allusions which are carried on in the New Testament to the sacrifices under the Law, as prg-fignifying a great atone."
"ment made by Christ; and by the strong ecpreflions which are used in describing the effeas of his death, the sacred writers jhow, as plainly as language allows, that there was an efficacy in his fufferings, far beyond that of mere example and infiruatio. The nature and extent of that efficacy we are unable, as yet, fully to, trace. ,Part we are capable of beholding; and the wisdom of what we behold, we have reason to adore. We discern in this plan of redemption, the evil of fin lrongly exhibited; and the justice of the ."
"Divine government awfully exemplified, in Christ fuffering for sinners. But let us not imagine, that our present disco."
"veries unfold the whole influence of the death of Christ. It is conneaed with causes into which we cannot penetrate."
"It produces consequences too extensive for us to explore. God thoughts are not as our thoughts. In all things, we fe only in part; and here, if any where, we fee also as through a gla  darkly."
"This, however, is fully manifest, that redemption is one of the most glorious works of the Almighty. If the hour of the creation of the world was great and illustrious; that hour, when, from the dark and formless mafe, this fair fyflem of nature arose at the Divine command; when the morning flarsfang together, and all the Jfns qs God ]houted for joy ; no efs illustrious is the hour qs the reftration of the world; the hour when, from coQn depnation and misery, it emerged Into SE RM . happiness and peace. With less external ._. majefly it was attended, but is, on that account, the more wonderful, that under an appearance so simple, fuch'great events were covered."
"III. IN this hour, the long series of prophesies, visions, types, and figure6, was accomplished. This was the center in which they all met: This the point, towards which they had tended and verged, throughout the course of so many generations. You behold the Law and the Prophets flanding, if we may speak so, at the foot of the cross, and doing homage.. You behold Moses and Aaron bearing the ark of the covenant-; David and Elijah presenting the oracle of teffimony. You behold all the priests and sacrifices, all the rites and ordinances, all the types and symbols, assembled together to receive their consummation."
"Without the death of Christ, the worship and ceremonies of the law 'would have remained a pompous, but unmeaning in "
"flitution. In the hour when he was cru- "
"cified, the book with the seven seals was opened. Every rite assumed its fignificancy; every prediaion met its event; every symbol displayed its correspond "
"The dark, and seemingly ambiguous method of conveying important difcoveries under figures and emblems, was not peculiar to the sacred books. The Spirit of God, in pre-fignifying the death of Christ, adopted that plan, according to which the whole knowledge of those early ages was propagated through the world. Under the veil of mysterious allusion, all wisdom was then concealed."
"From the sensible world, images were every where borrowed, to describe things unseen. More was underitood to be meant, than was openly expressed. By enigmatical rites, the Priest communicated his do&rines; by parables and allegories, the Philosopher inftru his disciples ; even the Legislator, by figurative sayings, commanded the reverence of the people. Agreeably to'this prevalt , mode of inftru&ion, the whole difL penfation of the Old Teflament was so conduaed, as to be the shadow and the figure of a spiritual fyflem. Every remarkable event, every distinguished perm fonage, under the Law, is interpreted in the New Testament, as bearing some reference to the hour of which we treat."
"If Isaac was laid upon the altar as an innocent viaim; if David was driven from his throne by the wicked, and restored by the hand of God; if the brazen serpent was lifted up, to heal the people; if the rock was smitten by Moses, to furnith drink in the wilderness; all were types of Christ, and alluded to his death."
"In prediaing the fame event, the han guage of ancient prophecy was magnificent, but feeringly contradi&ory: For it foretold a Messiah, who was to be at once a fufferer and a conqueror. The Star was to come rut of facvb, and the Branch to fprifg from theflem of Jee. The/ngel of the Covrnawt, tbh Deefre ofall Tations, was to Mfe fuddedty to his ten~ple; arid to htli "
"*Wa td be te gathering of people. Yet at the fame time, he Was to be despised and  eted of inen; he wds tb be taken froih prifoft nd from judgment, and to be led as hrib to tbflattghtet. Though he Was A ~ah of orrows and acquainted with griefý yet the Gentiles were to come to his light, dfid kings to the brightness of is riing. In thd hour when Christ died, those prophetical riddles were solved; those seeming contradidtions were reconciled. The obrcurity of oracles, and the ambiguity of types vanished. The Sun of righteousness rose; and, together with the dawfn of religion, those shadows passed away."
"IV. THIS was the hour of the abolition of the Law, and the introdu&ion of the Gospel; the hour of terminating the old, and of beginning the new dispensation of religious knowledge and worship, throughout the eairth. Viewed it. this light, it forms the most august sera which is to be founa in the history of mankind. When ERI . Chrifl was fuffering on the crbfs, wve are I . informed by one of the Evangelists, that he said, I thirf ; and that they filled a fpunge ,with vinegar, and put it to his mouth."
",After he bad tafled the vinegar, knowing that all things were now accomplJhed, and the scripture fufilled, he Jaid, It isflni/bed* ; that is, This offered draught of vinegar was the last circumitance predited by an ancient Prophet  that remained tq be fulfilled. The vision and the prophecy are now sealed: The Mofaick dispensation is closed. And he bowed his head, an4 gave up the ghost."
"It is fni/qed.-When he uttered these words, he changed the state of the universe. At that moment, the Law ceased, and the Gospel commenced. This was the ever-memorable point of time, which feparated the old and the new world from each other. On one of the point oJ teparation, you behold the Law, with its priests, its sacrifices, and its rites, retiring from fight. On the other  you be *Joha xix. z8S 29, 30. Pfa. lxix. 2 ."
"hold she Gospel, with its simple and- ve- sE 8. Mt nerable iniftitutions, coming forward, into view. 'Significantly was the veil of the temple rent in this hour; for the glory then departed fromi between the cherubims."
"The legal High Priest delivered, up his Urim and Thummim, his breast-plate, his robes, and his incense i And CHRIsti flood forth as the Great' High Priest of all succeeding generations. By- that ond facrifice which he now offered, he abolished sacrifices for ever. Altars on which the fire had blazed for ages, 'were n6w tb fmokb no more. Vitims were no more to bleed."
"Not with the blood of bulls and goats, but 'rith his own blood, he now entered into the Holy Place, there to appear in the presence of God for us."
"This was the hour of association and union to all. the worshippers of God."
"When Christ said, It zi'fnJhed, he threw down the wall of partition which had so long divided the Gentile from the Jew."
"HI gathered into one, all the faithful, out 6f every kindred and people. He pro 

fEt  ~laimed the hour to'be come,- whern the  knowledge of the true God should be Ab longer confined to one nation, nor his wrship to. one temple; but over all the earth, the worshippers of the Father should free kiiz in firit and in truth. From'that hour, they who dwelt in the uttermojl ends of the earth, frangers to the covenant of promise, began to. be, brought nighi In that hour, the light of the Gospel dawned from afar on the British islands.

During a long course of ages, Provi dence seemed to be occupied in preparing the world for this revolution. The whole Jewish ceconomy was intended to usher it in. The knowledge of God was preserved unextingtifhed in one corner of the world, ttait thence, in due time, might issue forth the light which -was to overspread the earth. Successive revelations gradually enlarged the views of men beyond the narrow bounds of Judaea, to a more extenive kingdom of God. Signs and miracles awakened their expedation, and direaed their eyes towards this great event. Whe

ijounfain, pr fpokg by the Prophet voice; whether be feattered his chosen people into .aptivity, or re-assembled them in their owA land; he was still carrying on a progreffive plan, which was accomplished at the death of Christ.
\ Not only in' the territories of lfrael, but over all.the earth, the great difpenfations of Proyidence refpeaed the approach of this important hour. If empires rose or fell if. war divided, or peace united the nations; if learning civilized their manners, or philosophy enlarged their views; all was, by the secret decree of Heaven, made to ripen the world for ,that fulness of time, when Christ was to publish the whole counsel of God. The Persian, the Macedonian, the Roman Conqueror, entered upon the sage, each at his predited period ; and, though he meant not so, neither did his heart think so, ministered to his hour. The revolutions of power, and -the fuccefflon of monarchies, were fa ar.,,anged by Providence,' as .to facilitate the  2 progress SsE  progress of th6 Gospel through the habil, _i able world, after the day had arrived, 
'when the flone which was cut out of ,
mountain without hands, fIould become a great mountain, and fil the earth *. This -was the day, Iwhich Abraham saw afar of, and was glad. This was the day, which many Prophets and Kings, and righteoul men, desired to fee, but could not ; the day for which the earnefl expetlation of the creaTure, long oppressed with ignorance, and bewildered in fuperfition, might be justly said to wait.
  THis was the hour of ChrifP triumph over all the powers of darkness;,
the hour in which he overthrew dominions and ' thrones, led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. The contest which the kingdom of darkness had long maintained against the kingdom of light, was now brought to its crisis. The period was come, when the feed of the woman Jhould bruise the head of the serpent. For many  * Dan,  34, 35 ages, the most gross fuperflition had filled ) a the earth. The glory of the uncorruptible God was every where, except in the land of Judsea, changed into images made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and beafs, pnd creeping things, The world, which the Almighty created for himself, seemed to have become a temple of idols. Even to vices and passions, altars were raised; and what was intitled Religion, was in effec a discipline of impurity. In the midst of this universal darkness, Satan had.
ereted his throne; and the learned and poliihed, as well as the savage nations, bowed down before him. But at the hour when Christ appeared on the cross, the signal of his defeat was given. His kingdom suddenly departed from him ; the reign of Idolatry passed away: He was beheld tofall like lightning from heaven. In that hour, the foundation of every Pagan temple shook. The statue of every salsa God tottered on its base. The Priest fled from his falling ihrine; and the Heathen oracles became dumb for ever.

SE ,i- . As on the cross Christ triumphed oviel Satan, so he overcame his auxiliary, thl world. Long had it assailed him with ita temptations and difcouragements. In thie hour of severe trial, he surmounted them ill. Formerly he had despised the pleaJ fures of the world. He now baffled itý terrours. Hence he is justly said to have crucified the world. By his fufferingsi he ennobled diflrefs; and he darkened the lustre of the pomp and vanities -of life. He discovered to his followers thb path which leads, through affli&ion, to glory and to vicory; and he imparted to them the fame spirit which enabled him to overtome. My kingdom is not of this world. In this world ye Jfhall have tribulation : -But be of good cheer; I have overcome the world *."
"Death also, the last foe of man, 'was the viaim of this hour. The formidable appearance of the fpe&re remained; but his dart was taken away, For, intha . hpur when Christ expiated guilt, he dif, "
"armed death, by securing the refurre-ion RM."
"of the just. When he said to his peni tent fellow-fufferer, To-day thou Jhalt be with me in paradise, he announced to all his followers the certainty of heavenly bliss. He declared, the cherubims to be."
"difnriffed, and the flaming sword to be fheathed, which had been appointed at the fall, to keep from man the way of the Tree. of life *. Faint, before this period, had been the hope, indiftina the profped, which egen good men enjoyed of the ,heavenly kingdom. Life and immortality were now brought to light. From the hill of Calvary, the first clear and certain view. was given to the world of the everJaftiog, mansions. Since that hour, they ahave been the perpetual consolation of believers in Christ. Under trouble, they looth their minds ; amidst temptation, thley support their virtue; and, in their .dying,moments, enable them to fay, 0 ,Deaqh ! where is thy fling? 0 Grave !"

"S RJ.  THIS was the hour when our Lord ..... erected that spiritual kingdom which is never to end. How vain are the counfela and designs of mei! How thallow is the policy of the wicked! How ahort their triumphing !. The enemies of Christ imagined, that in this hour they had fucceftik fully accomplished their plan for .his  ilruaion. They believed, that they had entirely scattered the small party of his followers, and had extinguilhed his namel and his honour for' ever. In derision, they addressed him as a King. They clothed him with purple robes; - they crowned him with a crown of thorns; they put a med into his hand; and, with insulting mockery, bowed the knee before'"
"him. Blind and impious men! How little did they know, that the Almighty was at that moment setting him as a King on the hill of Sion; giving him the Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoJ parts of the earth for his pofflion ! How little did they know, that their badges of mock royalty were at that moment ton verted into the signals of absolute domi- "

"power! The reed which they put into his hands, became a rod of iron, with which he was to break in pieces his enen-ies a sceptre, with which he was to rule the universe in righteousness. The cross, which they thought Was to stigmatize him with infamy, became the ensign of his renown. Instead of being the reproach of his followers, it was to be their boast and their glory. The cross was to fbine on palaces and churches, throughout the earthi It was to be assumed as the distinction of the most powerful monarchs, and to wave in the banner of victarious armies, when the memory of Herod and Pilate should be accursed; when -Jerusalem thould be reduced to ashes, and the Jews be Vagabonds over all the world."
"These were the triumphs which com menced at this hour. Our Lord saw them already in their birth he Jaw of the travail of his foul, and was fatisjed."

He beheld the Gentiles waiting below the cross, to   ceive the Gospel. He beheld Ethispia and the Isles Jfretching out their hands t4 God; the defart beginning to rejoice, and to blofom as the lose ; and the knowledge of ths Lord filling the earth, as the *waters cove the sea.

It was the plrformance of the mercy promied to the fathers. We behold the consummation of a great plan, which, throughout a course of ages, had been uniformly pursued; and which, against every- human appearance, was, at the appointed moment, exa6tly fulfilled. No word that is gone out of the mouth of the Lord, Jhall fail No length of time alters his purpose. No obitacles can retard it. Towards the ends accomplished in this hour, the noft repugnant instruments were made to operate4 We discern God bending to his purpose, the jarring paflions, the opposite interests, and even the vices of men; uniting seeming 'contrarieties in his scheme; making the zwrath of man to praiJ 'him; obliging the ambition of Princes, the prejudices of the Jews, the ER  malice of Satan, all to concur, eithevii ---,' bringing forward this hour, or ih cdi pleting its destined effects.

LASTLY, The consideration of this whole fubjet tends to excite gratitude and devotion, when we approach to God in ads of worship. The hour of which I have discoursed, presents him to us in the amiable light of the Deliverer of mankind,'

By such views of the Divine nature, Christian faith lays the foundation for a worship which shall be at once rational and affectionate; a worship, in which the light of the undeftladfng flall concur with the devotion ol heart, and the most profound rever united with the most cordial love. Christian faith is not a system of speculative truths. It is not a lesson of moral inftrution only. By a train of high discoveries which it reveals, by a succession ofintereffing obje6s which it places in our view, it is calculated to elevate the mind, to purify the affeaions, and, by the assistance of devotion, to confirm and encourage virtue. Such, in particular, is the scope of that divine inftitution, the Sacrament of our Lord Supper. To this happy purpose let it conduce, by concentering, in one striking point of light, all that the Gospel has flif  played of what is most important to man.

Touched with just contrition for pait offences, and filled with a grateful sense of Divine goodness, let us come to the altar of God; and, with a humble faith in his infinite mercies, devote ourselves to his service for ever.



# SERMON  On Gentleness.

The wisdom that is from above, is-gentle be wife in our own eyes, to be wife in the opinion of the world, 
and to be wife in the fight of God, are three things so very different, as rarely to coincide. One may often be wife in his own eyes, who is far from being f6 in the judgment of the world; and to be reputed a prudent man by the world, is no security for being accounted wife by God.
As there is a worldly happiness, which God perceives to be no other than difguised misery; as there are worldly ho-,
nours, which in his estimation are reproach; so there is a worldly wisdom,  . which, in bis fight, isfoolyij7nefs. Of this worldly wisdom the charaders are given in the co'ntext, and placed in contrast with those of the wisdom which is from above.
The one is the wisdom of 'the crafty; the other, that of the upright. The one terminates in felfilhnefs ; the other, in charity. The one is full of frife and bitter envyings; the other, of mercy- and of good fruits. One of the chief chara6ters by which the wisdom from above is diftinguifhed, is gentleness, of which I am now to discourse. Of this there is thU greater occasion to discourse, because it is too seldom viewed in a religious light; and is more readily considered by the bulk of men, as a mere felicity of nature, br an exterior accomplishment of manners, than as a Christian virtue which they are bound to cultivate. I ihall first explain the nature of this virtue; and shall then offer some arguments to recommend, and some direaions to facilitate, the pradice of it.

I BtGIN with dilfinguiflhing trud gen tlenffs fkdm passive tameness of spirit, and, froi Utnlimited compliance with the manners of others. That pamive tameness which submits, without firuggle, to every inctoachtnent of the violent and asfuming, forms no part of Christian duty; but, ori the contrary, is deftruaive of general happiness and order. That uhliinited complaisance, which, on every occafion, falls in with the opinions and manners of others, is so fat from being a virtue, that it is itself a vice, and the patent of many vices. It overthrows all fleadinefs bs principle; and produces that sinful conformity with the world, which taints the whole charater. In the present corrupted slate of human manners, always to assent and to comply, is the very worst maxim we can adopt. It is impossible to support the purity and dignity of Christian morals, without oppofing thd world on various occasions, even though we should fland alone. That gentleness therefore which belongs to vir 


 tue, is to be carefully distinguished from ' the mean spirit of cowards, and the fawnS assent of sycophants. It renounces no just right from fear. It gives up no important truth from flattery. It is 
deed not only consistent with a firm mind, but it necessarily requires a manly spirit, and a fixed principle, in order to give it any real value. Upon this solid ground only, the polilh of gentleness can with advantage be fuperinduced.

It flands opposed, not to the most termined regard for virtue and truth, but to harshness and severity, to pride and arrogance, to violence and oppression.
It is, properly, that part of the great 'virtue of charity, which makes us unwilling to give pain to any of our brethren. Compaflion prompts us to relieve their wants. Forbearance prevents us from retaliating their injuries. Meekness restrains our angry passions; candour, our Tevere judgments. Gentleness correts whatever is offenfive in our manners, and, by a conflant train of humane at 
tentiond, fludies to alleviate the burden SE 


of common misery. Its office, therefore, '
is eKtenfive. It is not, like some other virtues, I called forth only on peculiar emergencies; but it is continually in action% Vwhen' we are engaged in intercourse with men. It' ought to form our address, to regulafe our speech, and to diffufe itfelt over our whole behaviour.

I must warn you, however, not to confound this gentle wisdom which from abowe, with that artificial courtesy, that studied smoothness of manners, which is learned in the school of the world. Such accompli.hments, the most frivoldus and empty may possess. Too often they are employed by the artful, as a snare; too often affeCted by the hard and unfeeling, as a cover to the baseness of their minds. We cannot, at the fame time, avoid observing the homage, which, even in such inflances, the world is conflrained to pay to virtue. In order to render focietjr agreeable, it is found peceffary to assume somewhat, that may at  least carry its appearance. Virtue is thq  universal charm. Even its fha4dw is coursed, when the fubflance is wanting&
The imitation of its form has been wse duced into an art; and, in the commerce of life, the first fludy of all, who wpuwld either gain the esteem, or win the harts of others, is to learn the speech, and to adopt the manners, of candour, genltle ners, and humanity. Iut that geptlenefs which is the charateriftickl of a, good man, has, like every other vixtue, its feat in the heart; And, let me add, non thing except what flows from the bearmt can render even external manners truly pleasing. For no assumed behaviour. can at 'all times hide the real' charafter. In, that unaffeded civility which fpiings from a gentle mind, there is a, charm infinitely more powerful, 'than in all the fludied manners of the most finifbed True genjlenefs is founded on a sense of wtiat we owe to him who made us, and to the common nature of which we all hare. It arises from refletQon on our own failiigs and wants; and from just 
views of the condition, and the duty of man. It is native feeling, heightened and idiproved by principle., ft is the heart which easily relents; which feefs for every thing hat is fiuta  indc is backward mtd flow to infli& the least wound.

It' exerdifes' authority wikft moderation adminiftes reproof with tenderness; donfers favours with ealfe and' modefty. It is unassuming in opinion, and'"
"temperate ihW zeal.' It contendS not eagerly alobt trifles; ilow t6conit'rad and'"
"'still flower to blaine; but prompt to allay dissention, arid to rditord' peace. It neiffleF intettheddles' nrieedflarily with the affairs, nor pries inquisitively into the secrets, of others; ft delights 'above all things to alleviate distress, and, if it can "
"S  not dry up the falling tear, to o9pth, at VL. least the grieving heart. Where it has not the power of being useful, it js neyr burdenfonie.. It seeks to please, ;athej than to thine and dazzle; and conqeal with care that superiority, either q9 talents, or of rank, which is oppressive t4 those who are beneath it. In a word, i is that spirit, and that tenour of mannersy which the gospel of Christ enjoins, when it commands us to bear one another burdens; to rejoice with those who -rejoice, and to weep with those who weep; topleafe."
"every one his neighbour for his good; to be kind and tender-hearted;, to be pitiful and courteous; to Jupport the weak, and to be patient towards all men."
"Having now fufficiently explained the mature of this amiable virtue, I proceed to rpcommend it to your practice. Let me, for this end, desire you to confider the duty which you owe to Godl to confider the relation which you bear to oge another; to confider your own interest."
"I. CONSIDER the duty which you owe to God. When you survey his works, nothing is so conspicuous, as his greatness and majesty. When you'confult his word, nothing is more remarkable, than his attention to fofteti that greatness, and to place it in the mildest and least oppressive light. He not only charaterizes himself as the God of consolation, but, with condescending gentleness, he particularly accommodates himself to the situation of the unfortunate. 1e dwelleth 'with the humible and contrite. He hideth not his face when the affliced cry. lie bealeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.-When his Son came to be the Saviour of the world, he was eminent for the fame attribute of mild and gentle goodness. Long before his birth, it was prophesied of him, that he should not firive, nor cry, nor cause his voice to be heard in the Jreets; that the bruised reed he Jhould not break, nor quench the fioking flax*: And after his death, this SMatth. xii. 19, 20."
"'s 9  difiinguifhing feature in his charater was  SLtfo universally remembered, that the Apofýle Paul, on occasion of a request which he, makes to the Corinthians, uses those red markable expressions *, I beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Chrifl. Daring all his intercourse with mieht no harfhnefi or pride, or stately distance, appeated' if his demeanour. In his access, he was eafy in, his manners,, simple; in his an~swers,."
"mild; ia his whole behaviour; humble and, obliging. Learn of me,, said hi sot I an meek and lowly in heart.--Ars the Son God is the pattern, to the Holy Ghofit is the inspires of gentleness, His name is the Comforter, the Spirit of grace and peace."
"His fruits, or operations on the hinman mind, are love, meekness, gentleness, and lbngfuffering -Thus, by every discovery of the Godhead, honour is conferred upon gentleness. It is held' up to 6  View, ar peculiarly conneted with Celeffial Nature."
"And suitable to such discoveries, is the whole firain of the Gospel. It were unnecessary to * Cor.  i. Gal.  22."
"appeal to any single precept. You need "
"only open the New Tefiament, to find this ty virtue perpetually inculcated. Charity, or love is thd capital figure ever presented i eout vrew; and gentlernefs, forbearanceand forgiveness, are the founds ever re eurrirrg on our ear."
"So predominant, indeed, is this fpiril throughout the Christian dispensation, that even the vices and corruptions of men. have not been able altogether to defeat its tendency. Though that edifpenfation is far from having hithert6 produced' its full effet upon the word, yet we can clearly trace its influence, humanizing the manners o4 men. Remarkable, in this refpe6t, is the viapry whici it has gained over those powers of violence and cruelty, which belong to the infernal kingdom. Wherever Chriaianity prevails, it has discouraged, and, in fomen degfee, abolithed slavery. It lhas rescued human nature from that ignominious yoke, under which, in former ages, the one halfi of mankind groaned. It has  introduced more equality between the tw%

YI, sexes, and rendered the conjugal uniou, 
more rational and happy. It has abatedc the ferocioufnefs of war. It has mihi, gated the rigour of despotism, mitigate[
the cruelty of punishments; -in a words has reduced mankind, from thejir ancient barbarity, into a more humane and gentle slate.- Do we pretend re(pea and zeal for this religion, and at the fame time, allow ourselves in that harfhnefs,and feve, rity, which are so contraditory to its get nius ? Too plainly we show,, that it has no, power over our hearts. We may retain the Christian name; but we have abandoned the Christian spirit, r  CONsIDaR the relation whicl yo0, 
bear to one another. .Man, as a solitary individual, is a very wretched being.,
As long as he flands detached from his kind, he is poffeffed, neither of happinefl, nor of firength. We are formed by na-,
ture to unite; we are impelled towards each other, by the compassionate inftinas in our frame; we are linked by a thou-  
sand -connetions, founded on common wants. Gentleness therefore, or, as it is very properly termed, humanity, is what mari, as such, in every flation, owes to ntan To be inaccessible, contemptuous, and hard of heart, is to revolt against our own nature; is, in the language of scripture, to hide ourselves from our own flieh. Accordingly, as all feel the claim which they have. to mildness and humanity, so all are sensibly hurt by the want of it in others. On no are we more vulnerable. No complaint is more feelingly made, than that of the harlh and rugged manners of persons with whom we, have intercourse. But how seldom do we transfer the cafe to ourselves, or examine how far we are guilty of infliting on others, whose sensibility is the fame with ours, those very wounds of which we so loudly complain ?

But, perhaps, it will be pleaded by some, That this gentleness, on which we now insist, regards only those smaller offices of life, which in their eye aIe  - not essential to religion and goodthef Negligent, they confers, on flight occat fions, of the government of their temer, or the regulation of their behaviour, they are attentive, as they pretend, to the great duties of beneficence; and feady, whenever the opportunity presents, t6 perform important services to their fellow-creatures. But let such persons reflet that the occasions of performing those important good deeds, very rarely occur. Perhaps their situation in life, or the nature of their conneaions, may in a great measure exclude them from such opportunities. Great events give scope for great virtues; but the main tenOur human life, is composed of small occirt rences. Within the round of these, lie the materials of the happiness of most men; the fubjets of their duty, and the trials of their virtue. Virtue must be formed and supported, not by unfrequent aas, but by daily and repeated exertions. In order to its becoming either vigorous or useful, it must be habitually aaive; not breaking forth occailonally with 
a transient lufire, like the blaze of the conmet; but regular in its returns, like the light of day: Not like the aromatic gale, which sometimes fears the sens  but like the prdinary breeze, vwhich purifies the air, and renders it healthful.

Years may pass over our heads, with out affording any- opportunity for ads of high beneficence, or extensive utility.
Whereas not a day paiffs, but in the common tranfaaions of life, and efpecially in tlh intercourse of domeflic society, gentleness finds place for promoting the happiness of others, and for strengthening in ourselves the habit of virtue. Nay, by seasonable discoveries of a humane spirit, we sometimes contribute more materially to the advancement of happiness, than by aations which are seemingly more important. There are situations, not a few, in human lifeI where the encouraging reception,' the condescending behaviour, and the look.


of sympathy, bring greater relief to the  cc heart, than the most bountiful gift. While, 
on the other  when the hand of liberality is extended to bestow, the want of gentleness is fufficient to frustrate the intention of the benefit. We four those * whom we meant to bblige; and, by con ferring favours with ostentation and harshness, we convert them into injuries. Can any disposition then be held to possess a low place in the scale of .virtue, whose influence is so considerable on the happinets of the world ?

Gentleness is, in truth, the great ave nue to mutual enjoyment. AmidfP the firife of interfering interests, it tempers the violence of contention, and keeps alive the feeds of harmony. It softens animofities; renews endearments; and renders the countenance of man, a refrefhment to man. Banish gentleness from the earth; suppose the world to be filled with none but harsh and contentious spirits; and what fort of society would remain ? The solitude of the defart were preferable to it. The conflia of jarring lenwents in chaos the cave, where sub- 4---. ferraneous winds contend and roar; the den, where serpents hiss, and beasts of the forest howl; would be the only proper representations of such assemblies of men.
-0 that I had wings like a dove ! for.then Itwouldfly away, and be at ref. Lo ! then I would wander far of, and remain in the wilderness; I would haqfen my escape from the windy florm and tempef : For I havs seen violence and flrife in the city. Mifchief and sorrow are in the midst of it Deceit and guile depart not from the fJreet *.
-Strange! that where men have all one common interest, they should so often, absurdly, concur in defeating it! Has not Nature already provided a fufficient quantity of unavoidable evils for the slate of man ? As if we did not fuffer enough from the florm which beats upon us without, must we conspire also, in those societies where we assemble, in order to find a retreat from that storm, to harass one ano 



 ther ?-But if the sense of duty, and of --  common happiness, be infufficient to re*

commend the virtue of which,we treat, then let me desire you, 
III. To confider your own interef.

Whatever ends a good man can be supposed to pursue, gentleness will be founl to favour them. It prepoffeffes and wins every heart. It persuades, when ever other argument fails; often disarms the fierce, and melts the flubborn, Whereas harshness confirms the opposition it would subdue; and, of an indifferent perfoa, creates an enemy. He who could overlook an injury committed in the collision of interests, will long and severely resent the flights of a contemptuous behaviour.-
To the man ofgentlenefs, the world is generally disposed to ascribe every other gool , quality. The higher endowments of the mind we admire at a distance; and whe any impropriety of behaviour accompanies them,. we admire without love. They.arq like some of the distant flars, whose bene, 
ficaalinfluence reaches not to us. Where- I.  of the influence of gentleness, all in 
frme degree partake, and therefore all love it. The man of this charader rises in the world without struggle, and flourishes without envy. His misfortunes are univerfally lamented; and his failings are easily forgiven."
"But whatever may be the effet of this virtue on our external condition, its "
"fluence on our internal enjoyment is certain and powerful. That inward tran-tuillity which it promotes, is the sirs tequifite to every pleasurable feeling. It is the calm and clear atmosphere, the ferenity and sun-shine of the mind. Wherl benigiity and gentleness reign within, we are always least in hazard of being rufled from without; every person, and evefr occurrence, are beheld in the most favourable light. But let some clouds of disgust and ill-humour gather oh the mind; and immediately the scene change'"
"Nature seems transfdrmed; and the appearance of all things is blackened to out  view.' The gentle mind is like the smooth *---' fiream, which reflets every objet iii Itt juit proportion, and in its fairest colourk The violent spirit, like troubled waters, renders back the images of things diftoried ,and broken; and communicates to them all, that disordered motion which arise solely from its own agitation."
"Offences muji come. As soon may the waves of the sea cease to roll, as provo-."
"cations to arise from human corruption and frailty. Attacked by great injuries, the man of mild and gentle spirit will feel what human nature feels; and will defend and resent, as his duty allows lim."
"But to those flight provocations, and frivolous offences, which are the most frequent causes of disquiet, he is happily fuperiour.- Hence his days flow in a far more placid tenour than those of others i exempted from the numberless difcom*"
"pofures which agitate vulgar minds. Inspired with higher sentiments; taught to regard, with indulgent eye, the frailties of men, . the omissions ps the' careless, the follies of the imprudent, and the levity of the fickle, he retreats into the calmnels of his spirit, as into an undisturbed fanCuary.; and quietly allows the usual current of life to hold its course."
"This virtue has another, and flill more important connetion with our interest, by means of that relation which our present behaviour bears to our eternal state."
"Heaven is the region of gentleness -and friendship; Hell, of fierceness and animofity. If then, as the scripture, inftruts .us, according to what we now sow, we mztfl hereafter reap ; it follows, that the cultivation of a gentle temper is necessary to prepare us for heavenly felicity; and that the indulgence of harsh dispositions, -is the introducion to future misery. Men, I am afraid, too often separate those articles of their belief which relate to eternity, from'the ordinary affairs of the world."
"They conned them with the seasons of seriousness and gravity. They leave ther with much refpec, as in a high region, to which, only on great occasions, they common life, eonfider themselves- a1 liberty to' give free feope to their humour and passions. Whereas, in fa&, it is theft behaviour in the daily train of social in*"
"tercourfe, which, more than any othli cause, fixes and determines their fpiritdal charater; gradually inflilling thofo di4t positions, and forming those habits, 1whic affeat their everlasting condition. With -regard to trifles, perhaps, their malignant dispositions may chiefly be indulged."
"%3ut let them remember well, that those trifles, by increasing the growth of pei."
"vifhnefs and passion, become pregnant with the most serious 'mifchiefs; and may fit them, before they are aware, for being the future companions of none bat infernal spirits."
"I mean not to fay, that in order to our preparation for Heaven, it is enough to be mild and gentle or that this virtUi olone, will cover all our fins. Through the felicity of natural eonflitution, a Cetain degree of this benignity may be pes sessed by some, whose hearts are in' ether refpeas corrupt, and their lives irregular."
"jBut what I mean to assert, is, That where no jatteption is given to the government .qs temper, meetnefs for Heaven is not yet acquired, and the regenerating, power of religion is as yet unknown. One of the first works of the Spirit of God, is, to infuse into every heart which it inhabits, that gentle wisdom which is from above. They who are Chrif  have crucifed the ftefh, with its affeFions and luffs; but let it not be forgotten, that among the works of the feJh, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, flrife, and envyings, are as expressly enumerated, as uncleanness, murders, drunkenness, and revelling *."
"They who continue either in the one or the other, Jhall not inherit, indeed cannot inherit, the kingdom of God."
"Having thus shown the importance of gentleness, both as a moral virtue, and as a Christian grace, I thall conclude thr fibjeC, with briefly suggesting some cod  Gal. . 19, 20, 21. 


fiderations which may be of tife to facit  li tate the pradice of it.

FOR this end, let me advise you to view your charater with an' impartial eyeý and to learn, from your own failings, to give that indulgence which in your turn you claim. It is pride which fills the world with so much harshness and feve-'
rity. In the fulness of felf-eftimation, we forget what we are. We claim attentions, to which we are not entitled. We are rigorous to offences, as if we had never offended; unfeeling to distress, as if we knew not what it was to fuffer. Fromr those airy regions of pride and folly, let us descend to our proper level. Let us survey the natural equality on which Providence has placed man with man, and reflet on the infirmities common to all, If the reflection on natural equality and mutual offences be infufficient to prompt kumanity, let us at leafs remember what Vve are in the fight of God. Have wp apne of that forbearance to give to one another, which we all so earnestly intreat $ 


from Heaven ? Can we look for clemency or gentleness from our Judge, when we are so backward to show it to our own brethren ?

Accustom yourselves, also, to reflet on the finall moment of those things which are the usual incentives to violence and contentidn. In the ruffled and angry hour, we view every appearance through a false medium. The most inconsiderable point of interest, or' honour, swells into a momentous objeat; and the slightest attack seems to threaten immediate ruin.
But after passion or pride has subsided, we look round in vain for the mighty mifchiefs we dreaded. The fabric, which our disturbed imagination had reared, totally disappears. But though the cause of contention has dwindled away, its consequences remain. We have alienated a friend; we have embittered an enemy; *we have sown the feeds of future fufpTion, malevolence, or disgust.- Suspend your Violence, I beseech you, for a mo StE I , ment, when causes of discord oecur. 4n i- ticipate that period of coolness, which, of itself, will soon arrive. Allow yourfqlves to think, how little you have any profpe4 of gaining by fierce contention; but how much of the true happiness of life you are certain of throwing away., Easily, and from the smallest chink, the bitter waters of strife are let forth; but their course cannot be foreseen; and he seldom fails of fuffering most from their poifonou§
effea, who firfl allowed them to flow, 
But gentleness will, most of all, be pro.

moted by frequent views of those great objets which our holy religion presents.
Let the profpeds of immortality fill your minds. Look upon this world as a ftatq of passage. Confider yourselves as engaged in the pursuit of higher interests as acing now, under the eye of God, an introdu&ory part to a more important scene. Elevated by such sentiments, your minds will become calm and sedate. You will look down, as from a superior ftation, on the petty diflurbances of thp world. They are the felfifh, the sensual, $8 


and the vain, who are most fuibje& to the impotence of passion. They are linked so dlofely to the world; by so many sides they touch every objea, and every per; fbnr around them, that they are perpetually hurt, and perpetually hurting others.
But the spirit of true religion removes to a proper distance from the grating objets of worldly contention. It leaves us fufficiently connerted with the world, for ading our part in it with propriety; but difeogages us from it so far, as to weaken its power of disturbing out tranquillity. It inspires magnanimity; and magnanimity always breathes gentleness. It leads us to view the follies of men with pity, not with rancour; and to treat, with the mildness of a superior nature, what in little minds would call forth all the bitterness of passion.

Aided by such considerations, let us cultivate that gentle wisdom which is, in so many refpeas, important both to our duty and our happiness. Let us assume  if as the ornament of every age, and of 6 every station. Let it. temper the petu lance of youth, and soften the morose ness of old age. Let it mitigate authority in those who rule, and promote deference among those who obey. I conclude with repeating the caution, not to mistake for true gentleness, that flimzy imitation of it, called polished nianners, which often, among the men of the world, under a smooth appearance, conceals much afperity. Let yours be native gentleness of heart, flowing from the love of God, and the love of man. Unite this amiable spirit, with a proper zeal for all that is right, and just, and true. Let piety be 'conmbined in your charader with humanity.
Let determined integrity dwell in a mild and gentle breast. A characer thus fup ported will command more real refpeaCt than can be procured by the most mining cccompli(hments, when separated from # SERMON  On the Disorders of the Passions.

## ESTHER  13. Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the King gate.



On the DISORDERS of the PAssioNs.



Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as Ifee Mordecai the Jew fitting at the King gate.

THESE are the words of one, who; though high in station and power, 

confeffed himself to be miserable. They relate to a memorable occurrence in the Persian history, under the reign of Ahafuerus, who is supposed to be the Prince known among the Greek historians by the name of Artaxerxes. Ahasuerus had advanced to the chief dignity in his kingd<om Haman an Amalekite, who inherited all the ancient enmity of his race to  the Jewifi nation. He appears, from --- what is recorded of him, to have beert a very wicked minister. Railed to greatnefi without merit, he employed his power solely for the gratification of his paflios.
As the honours which he poffeffed were next to royal, his pride was every day fe?
with that servile homage which is peculiar to Asiatic courts; and all the servants of the King prostrated themselves before him. In the midst of this general adulation, one person only flooped not to Haman. This was Mordesai the Jews who, knowing this Amalekite to be an enemy to the people of, God, and, with virtuous indignation, despising that in.
folence of prosperity with which he, saw him lifted up, bowed wot, nor did him rt verence. On this appearance of diftee fpeat from Mordecal, Haman was fall -wrath: But he thought scorn ta lay hand on Mordecai alome. Personal revenge wma not fufficient to satisfy hiim, So violent and black were his paffiins, that he rts solved to exterminate the whole tation to ýwhich Mordecai belonged. Abusing, for ghis cruel purpose, the favour of his crelulous Sovereign, he obtained a decree to  sent forth, that, against a certain day, al the Jews throughout the Persian dominions should be put to the sword.
LMean while, confident of success, and blind to approaching ruin, he continued exulting in his prosperity. Invited by Ahasuerus to a royal banquet, which Esther the Queen had prepared, he went forth that day joyful, and with a glad heart.
But behold- how flight an incident was fufficient to poison his joy! As he went forth, he law Mordecai in the King gate and observed, that fill he refused to do him homage: He fJood not up, nof *was moved for him; although he well knew the formidable designs which Haman was preparing to execute. One private man, who despised his greatness, and difdained fubmiflion, while a whole kingdom trembled before him; one spirit, which the utmost stretch of his power tuld neither subdue nor humble, blatt ( Rh1. ec his. trrumphs. Hig whole 'foul ',aa  Sfliaken with a storm of passion. Wrath, 
pride, and desire of ,revenge, rose into fury. With difficulty he reftraifted himrself in public; but as soon, as he ';aMf to his own house, he was forced to difclose the agony of his mind. He gathered together his friends and family, with Zerifh his wife. He told them oftheglor of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the King had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the King. He faid,moreaver, Tea, Ether the .ueen did let no man come in with the King, unto the bznquet that fje had prepared, but myself; and to-morrow also am 1 inited unto her with the King. After all this preamble, what is the conclusion ?-
Yetr all this availeth'me notbing,'fo long as I fee Mordecai the ew, fitting at the King gate.

The sequel of Haman  history I shall not now pursue. It might afford matter ,for iuch inftru6ion, by the confpicu ou0 justice of God in his fall and punish- 
ment. IBut, contemplating only the fin- , '
gular situation in which the Text presents lim, and the violent agitation of his mind which it displays, the following refleaions naturally arise, which, toge, ther with fpme pradical improvements, ihall make the fubjea of this discourse.
I. How miserable is vice, when one guilty passion creates so much torment!  How unavailing is prosperity, when, in the height of it, a single disappointment can destroy the relish of all its pleasures ! IIII How weak is human nature, which, in the absence of real, is thus prone to form to itself imaginary woes !
  How miserable is vice, when one guilty passion is capable of creating so much torment! When we discourse to you of the internal misery of sinners; when we represent the pangs which they fuffer, from violent paflions, and a corrupted heart; we are sometimes fufpeaed of chufing a theme for declamation, and  of- hbeig&ening, thp piqure. which-

All this availeth me nothing, long as I fee oardscai the ew fitting at the King gate."
"Had this been a' soliloquy of Harnan*'"
"within himself, it would have been a fuffilient discovery of his misery. But when we confider it as a confedfion which he makes to others, it is a proof that his misery was become insupportable. Foi -#- -such agitations of the mind every man - firives to conceal, becaufd he knows they dilhonour him. Other griefs and forrows, he can, with freedom, pour out toj a confident. What he fuffers from tIh injuftice'or malice of the world, he is not ashamed to acknowledge. But when his fuffering ,rises from the bad difpofitionr of his owi heart; 'when, in the height of prosperity, he is rendered miserable, solely by edifappointed pride, every ordinary motive for communication ceases.
N6thing but the violence of anguish, can drive him to confess a ppffion which renders him odious,: and a weakness wh ch renders him despicable. To' what extremity, in particular, muff he be reduced; before he can disclose to his own family'the infamous secret of his misery In the eye of his family every man wies to appear refpedable, and to cover from their' knowledge whatever may villff or degrade' him. '-Attacked or 'reproached abtoad, he consoles himself with his im 
portance- at home; and in domeflic at-, 1.
tachment and rqfped, seeks for some penfation for the injustice of the world, Judge, then; of the degree of torment which Haman endured, by its breaking through all there restraints, and forcing him to publish his shame before those, from whom all men seek most to hide it.
How severe must have been the confli which he underwent within himself, before he called together his wife and all his friends for this purpose! How dreadful the agony he fuffered at the moment of his confeffion, when, to the astonished company, he laid open the cause of his distress !

Assemble all the evils which poverty, 
disease, or violence can inflit, and their flings will be found by far less pungent, than those which such guilty passions dart into the heart. Amidst the ordinary calamities of the world, the. mind can exert its powers, and fuggelt relief, And the mind, is properly the man; the fufferer, and his fufferings, can be diftinguflhed.

 Rn  But those disorders of passion, by feiz.,

' direaly on the mind, attack hu man nature in its strong hold, and cut off its last resource. They penetrate to the very feat of sensation; and convert all the powers of thought into instruments of Let us remark, in the event that is now before us, the awful hand of God; and admire his justice, in thus making the flunerk own wicAeddnefs to reprove bii, and bis hackflidings .correi him. Scepticks reason in vain against the reality of diO vine government. It is not a fibjet of dispute. It is a fadt which carries though evidence of sense, and displays itself before our eyes. We fee the Almighty manifeftly purfring thejinner with evil. We fee him conneaing with every single 
viation from duty, those wounds of the spirit which occafio the most exquisite torment. He hath not merely prriulgated his laws now, and deayed the dif, teibution of rewards- and puniThments ntil a future periq4 of beiag. But th6 lantiaons of his laws already take place; ER 
their effiets appear; and with such infi- .
.ite wisdom are they contrived, as to require no other ecutioners of justice against the fnner, than his own guilty passions. God needs not come forth from his secret place, in order to bring him to punishment. He needs not call thunder down from the heavens, nor raise any mitifier of wrath from the abyss below.
He needs only fay, Ephraim isjoined to his idols let him alone; And, at that instant, the finner becomes his own tormentor.
The infernal fire begins, of itself, to kindle within him. The worm that never dies, seizes on-his heart.

Let us remark also, from this example, 
how imperfetly we can judge from external appearances, concerning real happinefs or misery. All Persia, it is probable, envied Haman as the happiest Rerfon, in the empire; while yet, at themoment of which we now treat, there was not within its bounds, one more thoroughly wretched. We are seduced, 
 it  and deceived by that false glare whi I. 'profperity sometimes throws around bad men. We are tempted to imitate their crimes, in order to partake of their imagined felicity. But remember Haman, and beware 'of the snare. Think pot, when you behold a pageant of grandeir displayed to publick view, that you dit.
cern the ensign of certain happiness., 1i order to form any just conclusion, you muff follow the great man into the 
tired apartment, where he lays aside his disguise. You must tot only be able to penetrate into the interiour of families, but you must have a faculty by which you can look into the inside of'hearts, Were you endowed with such a powers ,you would most commonly behold good .men, in proportion to their goodness satisfied and easy; you would behold atrocious sinners, always reftlefs'and unhappy. *. 'I i VJnjuff are our complaints, of l4e promiscuous distribution made by Providence, of its favours ,among men. From, "
"'superficial views such complaints arise, ER  "
"The diflribution of the goods of fortune, indeed, may often be promiscuous; that js, ldifproportioned to the moral characters of men; but the allotment of real happiness fs never so. For to the wicked thbre is no peace. They are like the troubled jea when it cannot ref. They travel with pain all theiredays. Trouble and angui,/"
"prevail againfl them.' Terrours make theni afraid on every  A dreadful found ir in their ears; and they are 'in great fear -where no fear is.---Hitherto we have considered Haman under'the charaaer of a very wicked man, tormented by crimir nal paflions. Let us now confider him; Mierely as a child of'fortune, a'"
"ious man of the world; and proceed to -How unavailing worldly prosperity is, since, in the' midst of it, a single difa'isointmerit' is 'fuffcient' to embitter all its fTeafiftes.' We might Pat firft-imagInme tIat ihe natiural 'efft of prosperity would '. be, 
 be, to di uf over the mind a prevailihg __ fatisfadion, which the lesser evils of life could not ruffle or disturb. We might exped that as one in the full glow of health, dekpifes the inclemency of weather; so one in pofteffion of all the Advantages of' high power arid flation, should disregard light injuries; and, as perfe1c ease within himself, fhoul4 view, in the most favourable light, the behavi:
our of others around him. Such effects would indeed follow, if worldly prosperity contained in Itself the true principles of human felicity. Iut as it poffeffes them not, the very reverte of those confequences generally obtains. Prosperity debilitates, instead of' firengthening the mind. mos~ 6ommon effet is, to create an extreme sensibility to the slightest wound.
It foments impatient desires; and raises xpedations whfch no success can tatisfy.
It fofers a faTfe delicacy, which icilens in tthe midft'of indulgence. By repeated gratification, it ltunts the feelings of mien so what is pleating; arn4 leaves tAem unhappily unhappily acute to whatever is uneaty. ft 0, Hence, the gale -which another would scarcely feel, is, to the prosperous, a rude tempest, Hence, the rofe-leaf doubled below them on the couch, as is told of the effeminate Sybarite, breaks their reft.
Hence, the difrefpea fhowtt by Mordecar, preyed with fueh violence on the heart of Hanman. Upon rin principle of reason can we affiga a fufficient cause for all the difjrefs which this incident occasioned to 'him. The canfe lay not in the external incident. It lay within himself; it' afore from a mind diftempered by prosperity.

Let this example correft that blind eagerness, with which we ruth to the chace of worldly greatness and honours.
I fay not, that it should altogether divert ps from pursuing them; since, when enjoyed with temperance and wuldom, they may doubtless both enlarge Our utility, and contribhte to our comfort. But let it teach us, not to over-rate them. Let it convince us, that ublefs we add to them the npeefftry corrtaives of piety and' vir 1  tue, they are, by themselves, more likerly tcF render us wretched, than to make us Let the memorable fate of Hamar suggest to us also, how often, besides corrupting the mind, and engendering internal misery, they lead us among precipices, and betray us into ruin. At the moment when fortune seemed to finile upon him, with the most serene and fettled afpt .
she swas digging in secret the pit for hiS fall. Prosperity was weaving around his head the web of defirution. Success inflamed his pride; pride increased his thirst of revenge; the revenge which, for the fake of one man, he fought to execute on a whole nation, incensed the Queen; ah3 he is doomed to fuffer the fame death which he had prepared for Mordecai.,-
Had Haman remained in a private ila.  he niight have arrived at a peaceable old age. He might have been, I shall not, fay, a good or a happy man, yet pro3 bably far less guilty, and .less wretchy  than when placed at the head bs the greatest empire in the East. Who knoweth owhat is good for man in this life, all the Ldays of his vain life, which he fpendeth as a ]adqw?

An extensive contemplation of human affairs, will lead us to this conclusion, That among the different conditions and, ranks of men, the balance of happiness is preserved in a great meafore equal; and that the high and the low, the richl and the poor, approach, in point of reat enjoyment, much nearer to each other, than is commonly imagined. In the lot of man, mutual compensations, both of pleasure and of pain, universally take place. Providence never intended, that any slate here should be either completely happy, or entirely miserable.. If the feelings of pleasure are more numerous, and Smore lively, in the higher departments of life, such also are those of pain. If greatness flatters our vanity, it multiplies our dangers.. If opulence increases our gratifications, it increases, in the fame proportioa% our desires and demands. If  the poor are confined to -a more narrow .. circle, yet within that circle lii molt those natural fatisfaalions which, af all the refinements of art, are- found t4 be the most geouine and true.-- In 4 state, therefore, where there is neither 1o much to be coveted on the one hand, tot to be dreadecY on the other, as at frf appears, How submissive ought we to be to the di of4l of Providence! How terns perate in our desires and'purfuits! Hot much more attentive to preserve our vr tue, and to improve our minds, thaa 
gain the doubtful and equivocal advantages of worldly prosperity I-But now, layhig aside the consideration of Haman greAt trimes;. laying aside his high prb..
fperityi viewing him simply as a man, let us obferve, from his history, "
"Ilr. How weak human nature is, "
"which, in the absence of real, is thus prone to create to itself imaginary woes."
"Al this avalleth me nothing, so lbn as I fe Mordecai the fewjiftitn at the King gate."

Thus, whild we are incessantly complaining of theý vanity and the evils of human life, we make that vanity, and we increase those evils. Unskilled in 'the art of extrading happiness from the objets ardund us, our ingenuity solely appears in 'converting them into misery."
"Let it not  thought, tha troubles of this kind are incident only 'to the great and the mighty. Though they, perhaps; -from the imtemperance of their passions, are peculiarly exposed to them; yet the disease itself belongs to human nature; and fpreaas. through all ranks. In the humble, and seemingly quiet shade of private life, discontent broods over its imaginary sorrows; preys utpon the citizen, no less than upon the courtier; and often nourishes passions, equally malig."
"nant in the 'cottage and in the palace."
"Having once seized the mind, it spreads its own gloom over every surrounding objeit; it every where searches out ma "
".terials for itself; and in no dire~aon more ER RM."
"frequently employs its unhappy aaivi- 4. ty, than in creating divisions amongst plarkiqd, and in magnifying flight pro'vocations into mortal injuries. Those felf-created miseries, imaginary in the cause, but real in the fuffering, will be found to form a proportion of human evils, not inferiour, either in severity or number, to all-that we endure from the unavoidable calamities of life. In Atuations where puph comfort might be enjoyed, this man superiority, and that man neglet, our jealopfy of a friend, our hatred ps a rival, an imagined asfront, or a mistaken point of honour, allow us no reppfe. Hence, discords in families, animofities among friends, and wars among nations. Hence, Haman miserable in the midst of all that greatness could bestow. Hence, multitudes in the most obscure flations, for whom Providence seemed to have prepared a quiet life, no less eager in their petty broils, nor less tormented by their pas "
"--' prize for which they contended."
"FROM this train of observation, which the Text has suggested, can he avoid rlfleting upon the disorder in which human nature plainly appears at prifent to 'lie ? We have beheld, in Haman, the pi&ure of that misery which arises from evil passions; of that unhappiness, which is incident to the highest prosperity; of that discontent, which is common, to every state. Whether we confider him as a bad man, a prosperous man, or fimply as a man, in every light we behold reason too weak for passion. This is the source of the reigning evil; this is the root of the universal disease. 'The story of Haman only shows us, what human nature has too generally appeared to be in every age. Hence, when we read the history of nations, what do we read but the history of the follies and crimes of men ?, We may dignify .those recorded tranfations, by calling them the intrigues of ltjtefmen, and the exploits ps conquer- $ "
"ours; but they are, in truth, no other than the efforts of discontent to escape from its misery, and the firuggles of contending yaffions among unhappy men. The history of mankind has ever been a continued tragedy; the world, a great theatre exhibiting the fame repeated scene, of the follies of men Thooting forth into guilt, and of their passions fermenting, by a quick process, into misery."
"SBut can we believej that the nature of man came forth in this slate from the hands of its gracious Creator? Did he frame this world, and store it with inhabitants, solely that it might be replenilbed with crimes and misfortunes ?-In the moral, as well as in the natural world, we may plainly discern the signs of some violent convulsion, which has shattered the original workmanship ofi the Almighty."
"Amidst this wreck of human nature, traces still remain which indicate its Author. Those high powers of conscience and reason, that capacity for happiness, "
" that ardour of enterprize, that glow of  I_. affedion, which often break through the gloom of human vanity and guilt, -are like the scattered columns, the br6kent arches, and defaced sculptures of some fallen temple, whose ancient fpleridour appears amidst its ruins. So confpictidus in human nature are those charaters, both of a high origin, and of a degraded state, that, by many religious seas throughout the earth, they have been seen and confeffed. A tradition seems to have pervaded almost all nations, that the human race had either through some offence forfeited, or through, some- mifSfortune loft, that flation of primaval honour which they once poffeffed. But while, from this doarine, ill underftoodt and involved in many fabulous tales, the nations wandering in Pagan darkness could draw no consequences that were just; while, totally ignorant of the nature of the disease, they fought in vait for the remedy; the fame divine revelation, which' has informed us in what manner our apoftacy arose, from the abuse "
"of our rational powers, has inftruaed us alfp how we may be restored to virtue and t9 l4ppinefs."
"JIET us, therefore, fludy to improve thj assistance which this revelation affords, for the restoration of our nature, and the recovery of our felicity. With humble and grateful minds, let us apply to those pnedicinal springs which it hath. opened, for curing the disorders of our heart and paffionq. In this view, let us, with reverence, look up to that Divine Personage, who descended into this world, on purpose to be she light and the life of men:"
"who came, in the fulness of grace and truth, to repair the desolations of many generationt, to restore order among the works of God, and to raise up a new earth, and new heavens, wherein righteousness Jhould dw;ll for ever. Under his tuition let us put ourselves; and, amidst the Rtorms of passion to which we are here exposed, and the slippery paths which we Soufly to our own understanding. Than&"
"ful that a Heavenly Conduator vouchsafes his aid, let us earnestly pray, that from him may descend divine light to guite our fleps, and divine firength to fortify our minds. Let us pray, that his grace may keep us from all intemperate pasfions, and mistaken pursuits of pleasure; that whether it shall be his will to give or to deny us earthly prosperity, he may bless us with a calm, a found, and well-regulated mind; may give us moderation in success, and fortitude under disappointment; and may enable us so to take'warning from the crimes and miseries of othefs, as to escape the snares of guilt."
"WH I we thus maintain a due pendence on God, let us also exert ourselves with care in aaing our own part."
"From the whole of what has beer said, this important inftrution arises, That the happiness of every mati depends nore ptpon the state of his own mind, than upon any one external circumflance; nay, "
"more than upon all external things put together. We have seen, that inordinate paffons are the great diflurbers of life; and that, unless we posses& a good confcience, and a well-governed mind, difcontent will blast every enjoyment, and the'"
"highest prosperity will prove only difguifed misery. Fix then this conclusion in your minds, that the deftruaion of your virtue, is the deftrudion of your peace."
"Keep thy heart with all diligence; govern it with the greatest care; for out of it are the'"
"issues of hfe. In no flation, in no period, think yourselves secure from the dangers which spring from your passions. Every age, and every station, they beset; from youth to grey hairs, and from the peafant'"
"At your first setting out in life, efpe cially, when yet unacquainted with the world and its snares, when every pleasure enchants with its smile, and every'"

"'strong desire, If you allow any palioi everl though it be esteemed innocent, to acquire an absolute ascendant, yout inward peace will be impaired. But it any, which has the taint of gbilt, take, early poffeffion of your mind, you rilay date from that moment the ruin of yourt tranquilljty. Nor with the season of youth does the peril end. To the imha petuoJty of youthful desire, succeed the, more sober, but no less dangerous, attachments of advancing years; when the passions which are conne with interest and ambition begin their reigat and too frequently extend their malignant influence, even over those periods of life which ought to be most tranquit From the first to the last of man abdde on earth, the discipline must hever be relaxed, of guarding the heart from the dominion of paflion. Eager passions, and violent desires, were not made for man.1 They exceed his sphere, They find nid adequate objets on earth; and of courfe' A "
"can Be produftive of nothing but misery."
"The certain consequence of indulging thent is', that there fhal comean evil day, when the inguilh of diiappointment shall drive ut to acknowledge, that all which we enjoy avaleth us nothing."
"You are not to imagine, that the warn ings which I have given in this discourse, are applicable only to the cafe of such signal offenders as he was, of wh6m the Text treats. Think not, as I am afraid too many do, that, because your passions have not hurried you into atrocious deeds, they have therefore wrought no mirchief, and have left no fling behind them. By a continued series of loose, though apparently trivial, gratifications, the heart is often as thoroughly corrupted, as by the commission of any one of those enormous crimes which spring from great ambition, or great revenge. Habit gives the paflions strength, while the absence of glaring guilt seemingly juflifies them; and, una~aketed by remorse, thd finner proceeds in his course, till he waxmbold in guilt, and  become ripe for ruin. For, by gradual and latent steps, the deftruaipn of ouq virtue advances. Did the evil unyeil itself at the beginning; did the florm whlcl is to overthrow our peace, discover, as it rore, all' its horrours, precautions would more frequently be taken against it. But we are imperceptibly betrayed; and from one licentious attachment, one criminal passion, are, by a train of consequences, drawn on to another, till the government of our minds is irrecoverably loft. The enticing and the odious passions are, in this refpet, similar in their process; and, though by different roads, condu& at last to the fame issue. David, when he.firft beheld Bathsheba, did not plan the death of iUriah. Haman was not deliveied up all at once to the madness of revenge. His passions rose with the rifng tide of profperity; and pride completed what profperity began. What was originally no more than displeasure at Mordecai difrefpet, increased with every invitation he received to the banquet of the Queen; till it im- ER "
"pelled him to devise the slaughter of a VI1, whole nation, and ended in a degree of rage, which confounded his reason, and lurried him to ruin. In this manner, every criminal passion, in its progress, swells and blackens; and what was at first a small cloud, such as the Prophet servant saw, no bigger than a man hand, riing from thefea *, is soon found to carry the tempest in its womb."

of proper motives to ation; and that complete discovery would have raised him to a sphere too high for his pre sent powers. He is, therefore, permitted 
,to know only in part; and to fee through . I .a glass, darkly. He is left in that state .of conjecture, and .partial information, which, though it may occasionally fubjet him tq distress, yet, on the whole, conduces most to his improvement; which asfords him knowledge fufficient for the purposes of virtue, and of a&ive life, without diflurbing the operations of his mind, by a light too bright and dazzling. This evidently holds, with refpeft to that degree of obscurity which now covers the great laws of Nature, the decrees of the Supreme Being, the state of the invisible world, the future events of our own life, and the thoughts and designs which pass within the breasts of others *.

But there is an ignorance of another kind, with refpet to which the application of this remark may appear more dubious; the ignorance under which men labour concerning their happiness in the present life,, and the means of attaining it.
  * Vid. SE?.MJV.If there be foundation for Solomon '. complaint in he Text, who knoweth whdt is good for man in this life ? this confequence may be thought inevitably to fol-low, That the days of his life must be vain in every sense; not only because they are fleeting, but because they are empty too, -like the Jhadow. For, to what purpose are all his labours in the pursuit of an objea, which it is not in his power to discover or ascertain ?-Let us then fertoufly enquire, what account can be given of our present ignorance, refpeaing what is good for us in this life; whether no thing be left, but only to wander in uncertainty amidst this darkness, and to lament it as the fad consequence of our fallen state; or whether such inftructions may not be derived from it, as give ground for acknowledging, that by this, as by all its other appointments, the wiSf dom of Providence brings real good out of seeming evil. I shall, in order to determine this point, firit, endeavour to iti lustrate the doCtrine of the Text, That we know not, or at most know imperfealy, i "
"'vhat is good for us in this life: I Ihall next explain the causes to which this deset in our knowledge is owing: And Ahen shall ihow the purposes which it was intended to serve, and the effeas which it ought to produce on our conduct."
"THE whole history of mankind seems a comment on the docrine of the Text."
",When we review the course of human *affairs, one of the first objets whith every where attracts our notice, is, the mif-taken judgment of med concerning their own interest. That fore -evil, which o0lomon long ago remarked with refpe.-to riches, of their being kept by the owners thereof to their hurt, takes place equally with refped to dominion and power, and all the splendid objects and high flationd -of life. We every day behold men climbing, by painful steps, to that dangerous height, which, in' the end, renders their fall more vere, and their ruin' more cor "
"E ERM. fpicuous. .But it is not to high flations , . 'that the docQrine of the Text is limited."
"In the crimes by which too often these are gained, and in the misfortunes which they .afterwards bring forth, the greater part of every audience may think themselves little concerned. Leaving such themes, therefore, to the poet and the historian, let us come nearer to ourselves, and survey the ordinary walk of life."
"Around us, we every where behold a busy multitude. Restless and uneasy in their present situation, they are incessantly employed in accomplishing a change of it; and, as soon as their with is fulfilled, we discern, by their behaviour, that they are as diffatisfied as they were before. Where they expeaed to have found a paradise, they find a desert. -The man of business pines for leisure. The leisure for which he had longed, proves an irksome gloom; and, through want of employment, he languishes, fickens, and dies."
"The man of retirement fancies no state to be so happy, as that of aaive life. JBut he,has not engaged long in the tumults "
"pnd contests ps the world, until he finds *"
",cavfe to Jook,back with regret on the calm hours of his former privacy and retreat."
"Beauty, wit, eloqupnce, and fame, are eagerly desired by pegfons in every rank of life. They are the parent fondeg wish for his child; the ambition of the young, and the adrmiration of the old."
"And yet, in what numberless inflances ýhave they proved, to those who poffeffed Sthem, no other than ihining f9ares feduftions to vice, inftigations to folly, and, in the end, sources of misery ? Comfortably might their jays have passed, had they been lels cqnfpjcupus. But the diftinaions which brought them forth to ýptice, conferred splendour, and withdrew Lhappinefs. .Long life is, of all others, the most general, and seemingly thJe mnof innocent, objed of desire. With refpet to this too, we so frequently err, that it would have been a blessing to many to have had their wiih denied."
"There was a period, when they might have quitted the flage with honour, and Vilr. in peace. But by living too long, they outlived their reputation; outlived their family, their friends, and comforts; and reaped nothing from the continuance of days, except to feel the pressure of age, to taste the dregs of life, and to behold a wider compass of human misery."
"Man walketh in a vain Jhow. His fears are often as vain as his wishes. As what flattered him in expetation, frequently wounds him in poffeffioi; so the event to which he looked forward with an anxious and fearful eye, has often, when it arrived, laid its terrours aside; nay, has brought in its train unexpected blessings. Both good and evil are beheld at a distance, through a perfpedive which deceives. The colours of objeas -when nigh, are entirely different from what they appeared, when they were viewed in futurity."
"THE fact then being undoubtedly cer tain, that it is common for men to be deceived in their profpeds of happinef, Jet us next enquire'into the causes of that deception. Let us attend to those peculiar circumfiances in our state, which tender ?us such incompetent judges of future good tor evil in this life."
"First, We are not fufficiently acquaint with ourselves, to foresee our futdre feelings, We judge by the sensations of ,the present moment; and, in the fetvour of desire, pronounce confidently concerning the desired objet. But we refleat not, that our minds, like our bodies, tn,dergo great alteration from the situations into which they are thrown, and the progreffive flages of life through which they 'pafs. Hence, concerning any condition which is yet untried, we conjecure with much uncertainty.' In imagination, we carry our present wants, inclinations, and -"
"dentiments, into the fate of life to which we aspire. But no sooner 'have we entered on it, than our sentiments and inclinations change. New wants and desires arise; new objeds are required to gratify  them; and by consequence our old dif fatisfadion returns, and the void, which was to have been filled, remains as great as it was before."
"r But, next, supposing our knowledge of'"
"ourselves fufficient to direa us in the choice of happinefa, yet still we are liable to err, from our ignorance of the conieaions which subsist between our own condition and that of others. No individual can be happy, unless the circumflances of those around him be so adjufted as to conspire with his interest. For, in human society, no happiness or mifery flands unconneaed and independent."
"Our fortunes are interwoven by threads innumerable. We touch one another on all sides. One man misfortune or-fuccess, his wisdom or his folly, often, by its consequences, reaches through multitudes. Such a system is far too complicated for our arrangement. It requires adjustments beyond our skill and power."
"It is a chaos of events, into which our eye cannot pierce; and is ~capable of re "
"gulation, only by him who perceives at FRM."
"One glance the relation of each to all."
"Farther, As we are ignorant of the events which will arise from the combination of our circumstances with those of others, so we are equally ignorant of the influence which the present tranfa2tions of our life may have upon those which are future. The important question is not, What is good for a man one day; but what is good for him all the days of hit life? Not, what will yield him a few scattered pleasures; but what will render his life happy on the whole amount?"
"And is he able to answer that queffion, who knoweth not what one day may bring forth; who cannot tell, whether the events of it may not branch out into consequences, which will assume a diredion quite opposite to that in which they set forth, and spread themselves over all his life to come? There is not any present moment that is unconneced with some future one. The life of every man is a continued chain of incidents, each link SE  of which hangs upon the former. 'The yU transition from cause to effea, from event to event, is often carried on by secret fleps, which our foresight cannot divine, and our fag4city is unable to trace. Evil may, at some future period, bring forth good; and good may bring forth evil, both equally unexpeted. Had the Pa, triarch, Joseph, continued to loiter under his father fond indulgence, he might have lived an obscure and insignificant life. From the pit and the prison, arose the incidents which made him the ruler of Egypt, and the saviour of his father house."
"Lafily, Supposing every other incapa, "
"city to be removed, our ignorance of the dangers to which our spiritual state is exposed, would disqualify us for judging soundly concerning our true happiness, Higher interells, than those of the present world, are now depending. All that is done or fuffered by us here, ultimately refers to that immortal world, for which good men are trained up, under the cars of pn Almighty Parent. We are as "
"competent judges of the measures necef- ----"
"fary to be pursued for this end, as children are, of the proper condua to be held in fheir education. We foresee the dangers of our spiritual, flill less than we do those of our natural state; because we are lefj attentive to trace them. We are fiill more exposed to vice than to misery; because the -confidence which we place in our virtue, is yet worse founded than that which we place in our wisdom. Can you efteemn him prosperous, who is raised to a fitua."
"tion which flatters his passions, but which corrupts his principles, disorders his temper, and, finally, overfets his virtue ? In the ardour of pursuit, how little are these effeas foreseen ? And yet, how often are they accomplithed, by a change of condi."
"tion? Latent corruptions are called forth; feeds of guilt are quickened into life; a growth of crimes arises, which, had it not been for the fatal culture of prosperity, would never have seen the light. How often is man, boastful as he is of reason, "
"merely the creature of his fortune ; form."
", .  and moulded, by the incidents of his life!-Ha;ael, when yet a private maný detested the thoughts.of cruelty. Thou Jhalt flay the young men with bte sword, said the Prophet : Thou fjalt daJh the cbildren, and rip up the women with child. Is thyfervdnt a dog, replied Hazael, that he Jf7ould do these things ? But no sooner was he clothed with the coveted purple, than it seemed to taint his nature. He comnmnitted the crimes of which, at a diflance, he believed himself incapable ; and became the bloody tyrant, whose charaaer his foul once abhorred #."
"SuCH then at present is man; thus incapable of pronouncing with certainty concerning his own good or evil. Of futurity he difcerhs little; and even that little he fees through a cloud. Ignorant of the alteration which his fentimentq and desires will undergo from new fituations in life; ignorant of the confequeq 2 Kircgs  12, 13."
"ces which Will follow fromt the combina- "
"tion of his circumstances with those of pthers around him; ignorant of the influence which the present may have on the future events of his life; ignorant of the effec which a change of condition may produce, on his moral charater, and 'his eternal interests; How can he know what is good for him all the days of his vain life, which hefpendeth as ajhadow ?"
"Instead of onily lamenting this ignorance, "
"let us, in the last place, confider how it ought to be improved; what duties it suggests, and what wife ends it was intendfd by Providence to promote."
"I. LET this doctrine teach us to pro ceed with caution and circumfpe&ion, through a world where evil so frequently lurks under the form of good. To be humble and modest in opinion, to be vigilant and attentive in conduc, to diffruft fair appearances, and to restrain rash defires, are infiruCions which the darkness of our present slate should strongly in "
"E  culcate. God hath appointed our fitua4 Stiom *to be so ambiguous, in order both to call forth the exertion of those intelligent powers which he hath given us, and to enforce our dependence on his gracious, aid. It is not in man that walketh, to direc his fleps. Surrounded with so many bewildering paths, among which the wisest are ready to stray, how earnefily should we implore, and how thankfully should we receive, that divine illumination which is promised in scripture to the pious and the humble I Thefecret of the Lord is with them that fear him. He will guide then with his council. He will teach them the way that they jhould chufe. But what must be the fate of him, who, amidst all the dangers attending human conduct neither looks up to Heaven for diretion, nor properly exerts that, reason which God hath given him? If to the most diligent enquirer, it proves so difficult a talk to distinguish true good, from thfol fallacious appearances with ,which it is ever blended, how should be discover irt who' brinigs neither patience nor attention to the search; who applies to no other counsellor than present pleasure, and, with a rash and credulous mind, delivers himself up to every suggestion of desire )"
"This admonition I particularly diret to those, who are in a period of life too often charaCerized by forward prefumption, and headlong pursuit. The selfconceit of the young, is the great source of those dangers to which they are exposed; and it is peculiarly unfortunate, that the age which flands most in need of the counsel of the wife, should be the most prone to contemn it. Confident in the opinions which they adopt, and in the mefures which they pursue, they seem as if they underflood Solomon to fay, not, VWho knoweth, but, Who is ignorant of what is good for man all the days of his life? The bliss to be aimed at, is, in their opinion, fully apparent. It is not the danger of mistake, but the failure of success, which they dread. Aativity to seize, not sagacity to discern, is the SER i 'only requisite which they value.- How VIL . long shall it be, ere the fate of your pre deceffors in the fame course, teach you wisdom ? How long shall the experience of all ages, continue to lift its voice to you hii vain? Beholding the ocean on which You are embarked, covered with wrecks, are not those fatal signals fufficient to admonish you of the hidden rock? If, in Paradise itself, there was a tree which bare fruit fair to the eye, but mortal in its effeds, how much more, in this fallen slate, may such deceiving appearances be expeded to abound ! The whole state of Nature is now become a scene of delusion to the sensual mind, Hardly any thing is what it appears to be: And what flatters most, is always farthest from reality. There are voices which sing around you; but whose firains allure to ruin. There is a banquet spread, where poison is in every dish. There is a couch which invites you to repose; but to slumber upon it, is death. In such situation, be not high-minded, but fear. Let sobriety temper your unwary ardour. Let R1M."
"modefly check your rash presumption.  ."
"Let wisdom be the offspring of refleaion now, rather than the fruit of bitter experience hereafter."
"JL LET our ignorance of what is good or evil, corre6t anxiety about worldly fuccess. As rashness is the vice of youth, -the opposite extreme of immoderate care is the vice of advancing years. The doctrine which I have illustrated, is equally adapted for checking both. Since we are so often betrayed into evil, by the miftaken pursuit of good, care and attention are requisite, both in forming our choice, and in conduaing our pursuit; but since our attention and care are liable to be so ofterl frustrated, they should never be alJowed to deprive us of tranquillity."
"The ignorance in which we are left con .cerning good and evil, is not such as to supersede prudence in' conduQ: For wisdom is fill found to excel folly, as far at 4ight excelletb darkness. But it is that gree of uncertainty, which ought to red ,vt1. der us temperate in pursuit; which ought to calm the perturbation of hope and fear, and to cure the pain of anxiety."
"Anxiety is the poison of human life. It is the parent of many fins, and of more miseries. In a world where every thing is so doubtful; where you may succeed in your with, and be miserable; where you may be disappointed, and be blest in the disappointment; what means this refllefs flir and commotion of mind ?

To the vanity of life, you add a vexation of spirit, which is wholly of your own creation, not of Divine appointment. For the dubious goods of this world were never designed by God to raise such eager attachment. They were given to man for his occasional refreihment, not for his chief felicity. By setting an excessive value upon objets which were intended only for your secondary regard, you change their nature. Seeking more fatisfaaion from them than they are able to afford, you receive less than they might give."
"* From a mistaken care to secure your hapSpinefs, you bring upon yourselves certain misery."
"III. LET our ignorance of good and evil, determine us to follow Providence, and to resign ourselves to God. One of  the most important Jeffons which can be  Sgiven to man, is resignation to his Maker; and nothing inculcates it more, than the experience of his own inability to guide himfelf.-You know not what is good for you, in the future periods of life.

He is not only liable to that disappointment of success, which so often frustrates all the defigns'ot men; but liable to a disappointment still more cruel, that of being fuccefsful and miserable at once. Riches-and pleasures are the chief temptations to criminal deeds. Yet those riches, when obtained, may very possibly overwhelm him with unforeseen miseries. Those pleasures may cut short his health and life. And is it for such doubtful- and fallacious rewards, "

"What will turn to his advantage in the course of this life, he cannot with any asfurance know. But this he may know, with full certainty, that by breaking theDivine commandments, he will draw upon his head that displeasure of the Almighty, which shall crush him for ever."
"The advantages of this world, even when innocently gained, are uncertain blefsings; when obtained by criminal means, they carry a curse in their bosom. To the virtuous, they are often no more than chaff. To the guilty, they are always poison."
"V. LET our imperfect knowledge of what is good or evil, attach us the more to those few things, concerning which  there Cah be no doubt of their being ^ truly good.

  LET our ignorance of what is good or evil here below, lead our thoughts and desires to a better world, I have endeavoured to vindicate the wisdom of jProvidence, by showing the many useful purposes which this ignorance at present promotes. It serves to check presumption and rashness, and 0to enforce a.ýdiligent exertion of our rational powers, 'joined with .a humble dependence on Divine aid."

It tends to attach us more closely to those things which are unqueflionably good. It is therefore such a degree of ignorance as suits the present cireumftances of man better than more complete information

## PSAL.  4. Commune with your own heart, upon your bed, and be still.


 ^  Rx ON, IX.










Commune with your own heart, upon your bed, and be Jfill.


~I UGCH communing with themselves Sthere has always been among man, 
kind; though frequently, God knows, to no purpose, or to a purpose worse than none. Could we discover the employments of men, in retirement, how often should we find their thoughts occupied ,
with fubjeas, which they would be ashamed to own? What a large share have ambition and avarice, at some times the grossest passions, and at other times the )1eaneft trifles, in their solitary musings?


They carry the world, with all its vices, 
into their retreat; and may be said to dwell I in the midst of the world, even when they seem to be alone.

This, surely, is not that fort of com muning which the Psalmist recominends.
For this is not properly commu'ning with our heart, but rather holding secret in"
"tercourfe with the world. What the Psalmist means to recommend, is 'religia bus kecolledion; that exercise of thought which is connected with the precept givri in the. preceding words, - to fland in dwe, and fin not. It'is to commune with ourselves, tinder the charaaer' of spiritual and immortal beings; and to ponder those paths of our feet) which are leading us to eternity..

"To conne& one plan of gaiety with' anot- Vt ther, is their- sole study; till, in a very short time, nothing' remain but to tread the fame beaten round; to enjoy what they have already enjoyed, and to fee what they have often seen.

Hence, these are the pert6ns, who after having run through a rapid course of pleasure, after having glittered for a few years in the foremost line of public amusements, are the most apt to fly at last to a melancholy retreat; not led by religion or reason, but driven by disappointed hopes, and exhaufled spirits, to the pensive conclusion, that all is vanity."

The great and the worthy, the pious and the virtuous, ihave ever been addiaqd to feeious retirement. It is the cha-,
raCeriftic of little and frivolous minds, to be wholly occupied with the vulgar objets of life. There fill up their defires, and supply all the entertainment, which their coarse apprehensions can relilh. But a more refined and enlarged mind leaves the world behind it, feels a call for higher pleasures, and seeks them in retreat. The man of public spirit has recourse to it, in order to form plans for general good; the man of genius, in qrder to dwell on his favourite themes; the philosopher, to pursue his discoveries; .hel faint, to improve hiimfief in.- grace.

The advantages of religious retirement il still more clearly appear, by confider  as was proposed, in the nest plaee, 
Sfome of those great objea& which iholdd there employ our thoughts. I ihall Mention Vt.
only three, which are of the most plain and IX.
acknowledged importance; God, the world, and. our owa chara&er.

I, WHi sN you retire from the world, omrmure twith your hearts concerning Gol.
Impressions of Deity, besides their being the principle of what is ftrialy termed religion, are the great support of all moral fenjiment, and virtuous condua, among inei.. But with what difficulty are they preserved in any due degree of force, amidst the affairs and avocations of -the world? While the crowd of surrounding objects is ever rulhing on the imagination, and occupying the senses and the heart, what is not only absent from view, but, by its nature, invisible, is apt to vanish like a shadow. Hence it is given as the charaaer of wicked men, in scripture, that they are. without God in the tworld. They deny not, perhaps, that he does exist; but it is the fame to them as though be did not: For having loft him &  from their view, his existence has no efc set on their condut. If,. at aniy titie, 
the idea,of God rife,in, theirnmind, it rises like a terrifying phantom which they hasten to expel; and which they gladly fancy to be unreal, because they fee it make so little impression on others arotmn4 them. , i Let him who retires to serious medita.
  begin with impressing deeply on hi4 mind this important truth, That therejs undoubtedly a Supreme Governour, who presides over the universe. But' letg im not imagine, that to commune witlthit heart concerning God, is to search iota the mysteries of the Divine Nature, or tq attempt a discovery of the whole plan of Providence. Long enough he may bel wilder himself in this maze, without making any proficiency in the pradical knowledge of God. Shall he who knows so little bs his own nature, or of the -an turepf the objeds with which he isfurjn rounded, expea to comprehend the Being whQ made him ? To commune wth OUr 
selves; to any aufeful purpose, on this fubl je is to bring home to our fouls the inl ternal, authoritative sense of God, as of a Sovereign and a Father. It is not to fpecu2 late about what is mysterious in his effendel but to contemplate what is displayed of hib perfe&ions. It is to realize the prefenc8 of the Supreme Being, so as to produce the most profound veneration; and to awaken thd earnest desire of as near an approacli as our natbre will permit, to that great Fountain of happiness and life.

"termof parts of the sea,. even there you would find him. For in him you live and move. He fills and animates all space. In the barren wilderness, as in the peopled region, you can trace his footsteps; and in the deepest solitude, you may hear a voice which testifies of him."
"Him, indeed, you are never to con found with the workmanship of his hands. Nature, in its most awful or noft *pleasing scenes, exhibits no more than different forms of inanimate matter. But on there dead forms is impreffid. the glory of i living Spirit. The beauty, or the ."
"greatness, which appears in them, flows from the Fountain of all greatness and behity; in him. it centers; ofi his perfection it reflects an image; and towards him thould lead your view.-In converfjng with a fellow-creature on earth, it is not with his body we converse, 'though it .is his body only which we fee. From his words and actions we conceive his mind; with. his mind,,though invisible, we hold -correspondence, and dire& towards this Spiritual Essence, our affection and regard."
"Jn like manner, though here we behold no more of God than what his works difplay, yet, in those displays, we are cApable of perceiving the Universal Spirit, and of '"
"holding correspondence with this unseen Being, in veneration, gratitude, and love."
"It is thus that a pious man, in his re tired meditations, viewing natural objets with a spiritual eye, communes with his heart concerning God. He walks among the various scenes of Nature, as within SE  the precin of a' great- temple, in' the Shabitual exercise of devotion.. To tiof discoveries of the Supreme Being In his works, let him apply the comment of his word. From the world of Nature, let him follow God into the world of Grace."

"We'trade, as within an inchanted circle, where nothing appears as it truly is. It is only in retreat, that the charm can be broken. Did men employ that retreat, not in carrying on the delusion which the world has begtn, not in forming plans of imaginary bliss, but in fubjeding the happiness which the world affords to a Ari discussion, the spell would dissolve; and in the-room of the unreal profpeas, which had long amused them, the nakednefr 6f the world would appear."
")Prepare yourselves, then, to encounter thi light of truth. Resolve rather to beat & the dilappointment of frome #atteria Ix ... hopes, than to wander ,for ever in. the paradise of fools.

Let the last conclusions which you lhall form, "
"8  enter into the present estimate which you   . make of the world, and of life."
"Moreover, in communing with your felyes concerning the world, contemplate it as fubjea to the Divine dominion. The greater part of men behold nothing more than the rotation of human affairs. They fee a great crowd ever in motion; the fortunes of men alternately rising and falling; virtue often distressed, and profperity appearing to be the purchase of worldly wisdom. But this is only the outside of things. Behind the curtain, there is a far greater 'fcene, which is beheld by none but the retired, religious fpefator. Lift up that curtain, when you are alone with God. ' View the world with the eye of a Christian and you shall fee, that while man heart dev his -way, it is the Lord who direEeth his fleps. You shall fee, that however meh appear to move and at after their own pleasure, they are, nevertheless, retained in secret bonds by the Almighty, and all their operations rendered subservient to the ends of his moral government. You ihall behold him obliging the wrath of '-"
"man to praise him; punishing the finner by means of his own iniquities; from the' trials of the righteous, bringing forth their reward; and to a state of eemifig universal confusion, preparing the wisest and most equitable issue. While the faJhion of this world -is paf fast away, you shall difcetn the glory of another rising to Tucceed it. ( You thall behold all human events, our griefs and our joys; our love and our hatred, our chara6ter and memory, absorbed in the ocean of eternity; and no trace of'our present exiftence left, except its being for ever well with the righteous, and ill with the wicked."

It is only in retreat, where those false femblances disappear, and those flattering voices are silent, that a man can learn to think soberly of him  and as he ought to think."
"It has been said, that there are three charaders which every man sustains; and these often extremely different front one anotherc One, which be poffefles in his own opinion; another, which he carties in the estimation of the world; and a third, which he bears in the judgment of God.

"Enqtlre, for this purpose, .whether you be not conscious, that the fair opinion which the world entertains of you, is founded on their partial knowledge, both of your abilities and your virtues ? Would you be willing that all your ations should be publickly canvassed?

Awe is the first sentiment that rises in the foul, at the view of his greatness.

But, considered in conjun&ion with the moral perfelions of the Divine Nature, it serves to heighten devotion. Goodness asse the heart with double energy, when residing in One so exalted. The goodness which we adore in him, is not like that which is commorn among men, a weak, mutable, undifcerning fondness, ill qualified to be the ground of assured trust. It is the goodness of a perfec Governour, aaing upon a regular extensive plan; a fleady principle of benevolence, conduaed by wisdom; which, fubjed to no variableness or *hadow of turning, free from all partiality and caprice, incapable of being either toothed by flattery, or ruffled by resentment, resembles, in its calm and equal lure, the eternal serenity of the highest heavens.

"SUCH in general are the dispositions that conflitute devotion. It is the union of veneration, gratitude, desire, and refignation. It expresses, not so much the performance of any particular duty, as the spirit which must animate all religious duties. It stands opposed, not merely downright vice; but to a heart whiph is cold, and insensible to sacred Ahiogs; which, from compulsion pqrhaps, no 5 4 2 and i  and'a sense of interest, preserves fomne rel XY gard to. the divine commands, but obeys them without ardour, love, 6r .
  To recommend this devout fpitr to your imitation. I begin with hbrejving, That it is of the utmroft confequerce'
to guard against extremes of every kinO in religion. We must beware, left, bI feekin to avoid one rock, we fplit~upon another, It has been long the fubje4 of remark, that superstition and enthufiafn are two capital sources of delusion; fuperflition, on the one hand, attaching men, with immoderate zeal, to the ritual and external part of religion; and enthufiafm, on the other; directing their whole attention to internal emotions, and myftical communications with' the spiritual world; while -neither the one, nor the other, has paid fufficient regaid to the great ioral duties of the. Christian life.
Biut, running' with intemperate eagerntefi from there two great abuses of religion, 

-ren foave negle&l6d to obrerve, tat there .

re extremes oppoi~te to each of them,., -
into which they are in hazard of precipitating themselves. Thus the horrour ot fuperflition has sometimes reached so far, as 1o produce contempt for all external Inlitutions; as if it were possible for religlon to subsist in the world, without forms of worship, or public acknow'edgmdnt of God. It has also happened, that some whcf in the main are well aseded 1i the aufe of goodness, obrervng tdi perfSns of a devout turn have at times teen'carrfed, by warm affetions, into unjustifiable excesses, have thence hallily concluded, that all devotion was ain tQoenthfiafthT; ana, separating relf'ion totals, from tie art and affeatons, lave reduced it to a frigid observance of 'what they call the rules of virtue. Thfs is the extreme which I purpose at present to combat, by showing you, first, That true devotion is rational, and well founded nbxt, That is of the highest importance tb every other part of religion  and virtue; and, lastly, That it is moa conducive to our happiness."
"IN the first place, True devotion Is ra:"
"tional, and well founded. It takes its ri from affetions, which are effentiaf to the human frame. We are formed by Nature, to admire what is great, and to love what is amiable. Even inanimate objeas have power to excite those emotions."
"The magnificent profpeds of the natural world, fill the mind with reverential awe."
"Its beautiful scenes create delight. When we survey the a&ions and behaviour of our fellow-creatures, the affections glow with greater ardour; and, if to be unmoved, in the former cafe, argues a aefe&"
"of sensibility in our powers, it discovers, in the latter, an odious hardness and depravity in the heart. The tenderness of an affedionate parent, the generosity of a forgiving enemy, the public spirit of a patriot or a hero, often fill the eyes with tears, and swell the breast with emotions too big for utterance.

The solid and material duties of a good life, they hold to be in a great measure independent,of devout affeaion; and think them fufi; ciently supported, by their necessary conpe&joa with out interest, both inr this an4 in a future world. They insist much upcn religion being a calm, a sober,- and r4tional principle .of condu&.--I admit -SE RM. that It is very lauda bl to ave a rltonal - .religion. Bus I muff admonish you, "
"it is both reproachful and criminal, to -have an insensible heart. - If we reduce reJigion into so cool 'a'fiate, as not to adtit love, affeCtion, and desire, 'we shall leave it in poffeffion of finall influence over human life.

'To dire6 their inci'iation and taste 'towards the highest oAje6ts; to florri a relish within them, for virtuous and .piritual enjoyment; to introduce religion Into the heart, is the provinzce of devotion ; and hence arises its importance to the interests of goodnefs.' SAgreeably to this doarine, the great Author of our religion, who welj knew what was in man, 'laid the foundation his whole fytfem in the regeneration o1 the heart. The change which 'was'to be accomplished on his followers, he did not purpote to effea, merely by regulating their external condu&; hut by forming within them . new fiature; by taking away the heart of lone, and giving then a heart of fieh, that is,'a heart relenting and tender, yielding to the Divine impulse, and readily susceptible of devout Impreffibns. Thou Jhalt love the Lord thy God, with al( thy heart, and mind, and foul, atd strength: This is the firfl and great commandment. Myfon, give me thy heart, is the call of God to each of us: And, indeed, if the heart be with-held, it is not easy to conceive what other offering we can present, that will be acceptable to hinm.

SOs what nature must that man religion be, who profeffes to worship God, and to believe in Christ; and yet raises his thoughts towards God, and his Saviour, without any warmth of gratitude or love? I speak not of those occasional desays of pious affecion, to which the best are fubje&, but of a total insensibility to MU this part of religion. Surely, let the ont.

, 'ward behaviour be ever  irreptoachablej there must be some effential-defe il i *
heart, which remains always unmoved at the view of infinite goodness. -The afu fetions cannot, in this cafe, be deemed to flow in their natural channel. Somd concealed malignity must have tainted the inward frame. This is not the riaar whom you would chufe for your bofoma friend; or whose heart you could expee to answer, with reciprocal warmth, to yours. His virtue, if it deserves, that name, is not of the moit amiable fortl and may, with reason, receive the appefI lation (often injudiciously bestowed) of cold and dry morality. Such a perfot must, as yet, be far from the kingdonr of Heavesi.I As devotion is thus essential to religlio ia.its principle, so it enters into the pmr per discharge of all its duties.

rfe&iomn cannot, therefore, but ennoble 4nd4 improve it. The pure love of God, paturally conneas itself with the love of man. Hence. devotion has been oftea found a powerful infirument, in huma, niting the manners of men, and tanming their sunruly pallions. It fmoothe what i rough, and softens what is fierce, in owr eature. It is the great purifier of the 4Iffeions. It inspires contempt of the low gratifications belonging to animal life It promotes a. humble and cheerful contentment with our lot; and subdues that eager desire of riches and of power, which has filled this unhappy world with orimes and misery. Finally, it beftows that enlargement of heart in the fervicd of God, which is the great principle, both of perseverance, and of progress in lirtue, He who, unacquainted with devout affections, ets himself to keep thd Diviue commandments, will advance in obedience with a low and languid pacf likU one who, carrying a. heavy burdtn, toils to m0unt the hill.. But he whore ^ heart devption has wartned,, will procee4 on his3way, 'cheerful and rejoicipg. The 'one performs his duty, only because it is commanded ; tbenother, because he loves it. The one is inclined to do no more than necessity requires; the'other seeks to excell. The- one looks for his reward in somewhat besides religioh; the other, finds it  religion itfelfi. It is hbs. meat and drink to do the will of, that heavenly Father, whom he loves and adores. Which of these two are likely to make the greateft improvemeqt in goodness, is easily difcerned. Let us now confider, 
SIN the third place, the influence of devotion on the happiness of life. Whatever promotes and strengthens virtue, whatever calms and regulates the temper, is a source of happiness. Devotion, as I have just pow flh9wn, produces those effeas in a remarkable: degree. It inspires compos sure of spirit, 'mildnefs, and benignity1 weakens the painful, and cherilhes thq tarries on the life of a pious man in a smooth and placid tenour.

Besides exerting this habitual influenc on the mind, devotion opens a field, of enjoyments, to which the viciotfs are entire strangers; knjoymeits tl4d more valua6fe, as .they' peculiarly belong io retirement wheh the world leaves us, and to adversity when it becomes our foe. The are the two feaforis, for which every wife man would moss wifl' to provide some lidden ftoie of comfort. Fdr let fiim be plac in the most favourable fituatiofi which the human slate admits, the world can neither always amtfe hint, hor always shield him ftomn distress. There will be many. houtrs of vacuify, and many of deje&ion, in hig life. IF he be a stranger to God, and) to devoti6n, hoi7 dreary will the' gloom of solitude ofteh prove?

"III. I ENDEAVOUR tO corre& some errors, into which men are apt to falk concerning devotion, For it is but too obvious, that errors are often committed in this part of religion. These frequently disfigure its appearance before the world, and subjeCt it to unjust reproach. Let us therefdre attend deliberately to its nature, "
"o as to diftinguilf pure 6and rational  "
"votion, of which- I have hitherto treated, ffom that which is, in any degree;, puril ous and adulterated.

In the fifii place, It is an error 'to place 8evotion in thd mere perfot-mance of any external ah of worship. Prayer and praife,' together itih the ordinancel peculiar to the Christian religion, are the agpoVited means of raifi'ng the heart towards the Supreme Being. They are th6 inhituted signs of devotin ; the language .in which it naturally expresses itself. But let us remember, that they' are signs and expreflons only; and we' all know, that, in various cares, thete may not correspond to the thing signified. It is  the difpofition of the heart, not in the motion of the lips, or in the posture of the bodr, that devotion copfifts. The heart .may pray or praise, when no words are uttere. But if the heart be unconcerned or ill affeated, 'all the words we can utter, how properly framed soever, are n6 other than empty and unacceptable founds in the ear of the Almighty.

the feond plaee, It is an err'or to -ai eonceive the pleaforts and advantaged of '.devotion, to be indiscriminately *open t9 -all. Dev6tion, like mapy parts of eligiop, may in some lights- boe confidred 'a privilege, ap4 in others 4s a duty, It is the duty of all, tQ love God, and to trefigq thermielyve tq his wilt, Biut; i the privilege of good WeA oply, It -rejoice in God, and to confide in 4is friendship. Hence a certain prepation is requisite, for the enjoyment 9f devotipa in its whole extent. Not qnly must ti life be reformed from, grol enprziitifs, but the heart must have undergop$ that change which the qofpel dqmands. A competent knowledge of God npuif b1 acquired. A proper fgundatiop must bI laid in faith and repentance, for Wtefourfe with Heaven.

They who would rush all at once from, the arms of the wqrld, inIto the sacre4 retreat of devotion; they who imagine that retreat to stand alwayq ready fr jh .reception of such as betake themfeh, lvto  fox no alpn,,bgbggcadu every qther .ir%, .

"apdn ;to consecrate their days entirely tot God, Situatitin sometimes occur, which both justify a great degree of retreat'from the world, and entitle it to refpea. But, wijh regard to ,the bulk of mankind, Chfiftian devotion neither requires nor imtolies anry such sequestration from the affairsa of men:- Nay, for the most partj it 'will be cultivated with greater ficcefs by those who mingle it with the acive employments of life. For the mind, wJhan entirely oicupied by any one objet4,i is in' hazard of viewing it at last through a false medium., Obje6s, efpeciily, so great and sublime as those of devdtion, when we attempt to fix upon SER1M. them unremitting 'attetion, *overketeh - and disorder oua feeble powers , The mind,, by being relaxed,- returns to them with more advantage, As none of our organs can bear intense sensations withbut injury; as the eye, when edzzled -with overpowering light, -beholds imaginary colours, and loses the real diftindkiot ofljobje ; so the mind, when Qverheated by perpetual contemplation of celcftial tdinag, has been sometimes found to.anjiftae dta Arong impressions of fancy, fgtfupernat,.

"Ements -of humana society. Itjchetksi io deed, that spirit of ,diffipatioq which too prevalent. It not only prohibits plea- "
"(uses which -are unlawful, but likewise -"
"that unlawful degree of attachment to pleasures in themselves innocent, which withdraws the attention of man from what is serious and important. But it brings amusement under due limitation, without ektirpating it. It forbids it as ,the bufinefa, but permits it as the re3axation, of life. For there is nothing ih, the spirit of true religion, which is hostile to a cheerful enjoyment of our- situation in the world, 1 They who look with a severe and iddignant eye, upon all the recreations by which the cares of men are relieved, and the union of society is cemented, are,in two refpes, injurious to religion. First, they exhibit it to others under a fotbidding form, by clothing it with the garb of so mitch unnecessary austerity. And next, they deprive the world of the betiefit which their exarpple might afford, iS drawing the line between innocent and'
dangerous pleasures. By a temperate participation of those which are innocent' , i-- they might fuccefsfully' exert that authority, which a virtuous and' refpetable chara&er always poffeffes, mn\efitrainng undue excess. They would' show the young and unwary, at what point they ought.
to flop. They would have it in their power, to regulate, in' some degree, public 'manners ; to check extravagance, to humble presumption, ~ put vice 
the blush. But, through injudicious teverity, they fall short of the good they might perform. By 'an indiscriminate censure of all anmufement, they detra from the weight of their reproof, when amusement becomes undoubtedly einfuT.
By totally withdrawing them'elves from the'circle of cheerful life, they deliver up the entertainments of society, into the hands of the loose, and the corrupted; and permit the bliad power of fashion, uncontrouled, to establish its own standards, and to exercife' its dangerous sway pver the world.

IN the fifth place, It is ah error to  


lieve, tha; devotion nourishes, a spirit of severity, in. judging of the manners and charaters bs6 others. Under this reproach, indeed, it has so long fuffered in the world; that. with too many, the appellation of devout, suggests no other tharafter, but that of a four and recluse bigot, who delights in censure. But the reproach is unjufi; for fueh a spirit is entirely opposite to the nature of true del votion. The very first traces which it imtprints on the mind, are candour and humility. Its principles atre libeal. Its'
genius is unaffuming' and mild. Severe only to itself, it makes every allowance for others which humanity can suggest tJ claims no privilege of looking into their hearts, or of deciding with refped to their eternal ftate.--I your supposed devotion produce contrary effedts; if it infuse harshness into your sentiments, and acrimony into your speech ; you may conclude, that under a serious appear-."

It were too much to expe that in the prefett state of human frailtyo those happy feelings should be uniform incd conflant. Opprefflon of worldly cares, languor of spirits, and infirmities of health, frequently indispose us for the enjoyment of devout affekions.- Pious men, on these occafrons, are in hazard of passing judgment on their own state with too much severity , as if, for some great iniquity, they were condemned by God to final hardness of heart. Hence arises that melancholy, which has been seen to overcloud them; and which has given occasion, to many contemptuous fcoffs of ungodly men. But it is a melancholy which deserves to be treated with eendern efs, not with contempt. It is-the excess of virtuous and pious sensibility. It is bt the  the overflowing of a heart affetedC int extreme degree, -with the humble feni of-its own failings, and withb ardent concern to attain the favour of God.-' A weakness, however, we' admitp it, tb bd though not a crime ; and hold it to be perfetly separable from the essence of devotion. For contrition, though it rhay melt, ought not to fink or overpowet thd heart of a Chritlian. The tear of repent-&
ance bririgs its own relief. Religion it a spring of consolation, not of terrour, to every well-informed mind, which, in 'a proper manner, rests its hope on the infinite goodness of God, and the all-fufficient merit of Christ.

To conclude, Let us remove from de5 .votion, all those mistakes, to which thd corruptions of men, -or their ignorance and prejudices, have given rife. With us let it be the worship of God, in spirit and in truth ; the elevation of the foul towards him, in simplicity and love. Let us pursue it as the principle of virtuous tondua, and of inward peace. By fre- I 
quent and serious meditation on the great objeas of religion, let us lay ourselves open to its influence. By means of the inflittitions of the Gospel, let us cherifi its impreflions. And, above all, let us pray to God, that he may eflablifh its power in our heart. For here, if any where, his assistance is requisite. The spirit of devotion is his gift. From his inspiration it proceeds. Towards him it tends; and in his presence hereafter, it thall attain its full perfetion.


# SERMON XI. On the Duties of the Young.

## TITUS  6. Young men likewife exhort, to be sober-minded.



On the DUTIES of the You roung men likewise exhort, to befober-minded.

OBRIETY of mind, is one of tiofr  virtues which the present condition of human life strongly inculcates. The uncertainty of its enjoyments, checks presumption ; the multiplicity of its dangers, demands perpetual caution. Moderation, vigilance, and felf-government, are duties incumbent on all; but efpecially on such as are beginning the journey of life. To them, therefore, the admonition in the Text is, with great propriety, direted; though there is reason to fear, that, by them it is in hazard of being least regarded. Experience enforces the  
admonition on the molt giddy, after they .
have advanced in years. But the whole slate of youthful views and passions, is adverse to sobriety of mind. The scenes which present themselves, at our entering upon the world, are commonly flattering.
Whatever they be in themselves, the lively spirits of the young gild every opening profpea. The field of hope appears to stretch wide before them. Pleasure seems to put forth its blossoms on every 
Impelled by desire, forward they ruif with inconfiderlte ardour : Prompt to decide, and to choose; averse to hesitate, or to enquire; credulous, because untaught by experience; rash, because unacquainted with danger; head-firongi because unfubdued by disappointment, Hence arise the perils, of which it is my design at present to warn them. I shall take sobriety of mind, in its most compre*
henfive sense, as including the whole of that discipline which religion and virtue prescribe to youth. Though the words ER  of the Text are direaly addressed to young % men, yet, as the fame admonition is givet in a preceding verse to theother sex, the infirudions which arise from, the .Text -ai to be considered as common to both, I intend, first, to show them the importance of beginning early to give serious atteqtiop to their condua; and, next, to poin out those virtues which they ought chiefly to cultivate.

/ As soon as you are capable of rfflection, you must perceive that there is right and a wrong, in human aations You fee, that those who are born with the fame advantages of fortune, are not all equally prosperous in the course of life.
While some of them, by wife and steady condua, attain diftinaion in the world, and pass their days with comfort and iotour; others of the fame rank, by mean and vicious behaviour, forfeit the advantages of their birth, involve 'themfelves in much misery, and end in being a dif.
grace to their friends, and a burden on facietyr krarly, then, you may learn, that it is knot -6n the. external condition in -
Awhich you find yourselves placed, but on the part which you are to at, that youi Xvelfare or unhappiness, your honour or infamy,, depend. Now, when beginning 4o a& that part, what can be of greater moment, than to regulate your plan of eondu& with the most serious attention, before you have yet committed any fatal or irretrievable errors ? If, initead of exkrting refleaion for this valuable purpose, you deliver yourselves up, at so critical a time, to sloth and pleasure; if you refuse to listen to any counsellor but humour, or to attend to any pursuit except that of amusement; if you allow yourselves to float loose and careless on the tide of life, ready to receive any direc. which the current of fashion may thance to give you; what can you expet to follow from such beginnings ? While many around you are undergoing the consequences of a like indiscretion, for what reason shall not those consequeiqces extend to you ? Shall you only , attain success without that preparation, and escape dangers without that precaution, which is required of others ? Shall -happiness grow up to you, of its own accord, and solicit your- acceptance, .when, to the reft ds mankind, it is the fruit of long cultivation, and the acquitfion of labour and care ?- Deceive riot yourselves with such arrogant hopes.' Whatever be your rank, Providence will not, for your fake, reverse its eftablilied' or * der. The Author of your being hith en joined you to take hebe to your taysj to ponder the paths of your feet; to retmcicr your-Creator in the days of your youth. TBe hath rdecreed, that they only whb tk aster wisdom, Jhall findt  that fidls fatll be iaffidled, because of their tranfgrefions; and that whoso refufetb infiruflion, fall deflroy his own foul. By listening to these admotiitfons, and tempering the vivatity of youth with a proper mixture of fefious thought, you may tenfure cheerfulnets for the reft of life; bat by delivering Your selves up at present to giddiness and levity, you lay the foundation of lalting XL.
heaviness of heart..

When you look forward to those plans of lifei which. either your circumfiances havq suggested, or your friends have proposed, yot will not hesitate to acknowledge, that in order to pursue them with advantage, some previous discipline is requifite. Be assured, that whatever is to be your profefflion, no education is' more .necef8ary to your success, than the acquirement of virtuous- dispositions and habits. This is the universal preparation for every chara&er, and every ftatiotr in life. Badas the world is, refpea is always paid to virtue. In the usual c6urse of human affairs, it will be found, that a plain understanding joined -wIth acknowledged worth, contribute more to prosperity, than the brightest partd without probity or fionour. Whether science, or business, or public life, be your aim, virtue still enters, for a prihoipal share, into all those great departments of society.

Whatever ornamental or engaging'ene dowments you now possess, virtue is A oeceffary requisite, in order to their bin. with proper lustre.

ps6 the mind. These are the qualities whose influence will last, when th6 luflre ofTall that once sparkled and dazzled has , paffd away Let not then the season of youth be barren of improvements, so essential to fyour future felicity and honour. NoW is th6 seed-time of life; and according to what youzow, you fJlall reap. Your charater is now' under Divine assistance, of your own forming; your fate is, in some measure, put into your own hands. Your nature is as yet pliant and soft. Habits ,iave not established their dominion. Prejudices have not pre-occupied your underflanding. The world has not had time to contrat and debase your affe&ions."
"All your powers are more vigorous, difembarrassed, and free, than they will be at any future period. Whatever impulse you now give to your desires and passions, the <liretion is likely to continue. It kill form the channel in which yout life is to run nay, it may determine its ever "
" lasting issue. Confider then the employ . ment of this important period, as the highest truss which shall ever be committed to you; as, in a great measure, decisive of your happiness, in time, and in eternity./ As in the succession of the seasons, each, by the invariable laws of Nature, affeas the produaions of what is next in course; so, in human. life, every period of our age, according as it is well or ill spent, influences the happiness of that which is to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accomplished and flourishing manhood; and such manhood passes of itself, without uneasiness, into. refpetable and tranquil old age."
"But when Natureis turned out of its regular course, disorder takes place in the moral, just as in the vegetable world. If the Spring put forth no blossoms in Summer there will be no beauty, and in Autumn, no fruit. Soeif youth be trifled away without improvement, manhood will be contemptible, and old age miserable. If the beginnings of life have been vanity, its latter end can be no other than vexation offpirit."
"'Having thus shown the importance of beginning early to give serious attention to conduct, I come, next, to point out the virtues which are most necessary to be cultivated in youth. What I shall, "
"1tXI. RECOMMEND, is piety to God. With this I begin, both as the foundatior of good morals, and as a disposition particularly graceful and becoming in youth, To be void of it, argues a cold heart, deftitute of some of the best affecions which belong to that age. Youth is the season of warm and generous emotions. The heart thould then, spontaneously, rife intq the admiration of what is' great, glow with *the love of what is fair and excellent, and melt at the discovery of tenderners and goodness. .JWhere can any object be found, so proper to kindle those affeaions, as the Father of the universe, and the Author of all felicity?"
"'tnmoved by veneration, can you con "
" template that grandeur and majesty, "
"XL. which his'works every where display?"
"Untouched by gratitude, can you 4view that profusion of good, which, in thii pleasing season of life, his beneficent hand pours around you ? Happy in the love and affetion of those with whom you are conneced, look up to the' Supreme Being, as the inspirer of all the friendship which has ever been lhown you bs others; himself, your best and your first friend; formerly, the supporter of your infancy, and the guide of yodt child, hood; now, the guardian of your youti, and the hope of your coming years."
"View religious homage, as a natural ex."
"pression of gratitude to him for all his goodness. Confider it as the service of the God ofyour fathers; of him, to whom your parents devoted you; of him, whom in former ages your ancestors honouredj and, by whom they are now rewardedi and blessed in heaven. Conneaed with so many tender sensibilities of foul, let religion be with you, not the cold and, "
"barren offspring of speculation, but the warm and vigorous diaate of the heart."
"But though piety chiefly belong to the heart, yet the aid of the underflanding is requisite, to give a proper dire&ion tcd the devout affections. You muff endeavour, therefore, to acquire jufft views, both of the great principles of natural religion, and of the peculiar doarines of the gospel."
"For this end, study the sacred scripfures. Consult the word of God, more than the systems of men, if you would know the truth in its native purity."
"When, upon rational and sober enquiry, you have eltablifhed your principles, susser them not to be ihaken, by the fcoffs ps the licentious, or the cavils of the fceptical. Remember, that in the examination of every great and comprehensive plan, such as that of Christianity, difficulties may be expeced to occur; and that reasonable evidence is not to be reje  because the nature of our present state allows us only to know in part, and to fee through a glass, darkly."
"Impress your minds with reverence soir all that is sacred. Let no wantonness oE youthful spirits, no compliance with the intemperate mirth of others, ever betray you into prophane sallies. Besides the guilt which is thereby incurred, nothing gives a more odious appearance of peti, lance and presumption to youth, than the affetation of treating religion with levi, ty. Instead of being an evidence of fupe riour understanding, it discovers a pert and shallow mind; which, v4in, of the first smatterings of knowlqdge, prefpmes to make light 6f what the reft of mankind At the fame time, you are not to ima gine, that when exhorted to be religious, you are called upon, to become more formal and solemn in your manners thaq others of the fame years, or to ered yourselves into supercilious reprovers of thofq around you. The spirit of true religion breathes gentleness and affability. It'"
"gives a native, unaffeaed ease to the behaviour. It is social, kind, and cheerm ful far removed from that gloomy and illiberal superstition which clouds the ."
"brow, iharpens the temper, dejeas the fpiritj and teaches'men to fit themfelvea for another world, by neglecting the concerns of this. Let your religion, on the contrary, connet preparation for heaven, with an honourable discharge of the duties of aaive life. Let it be associated in your imagination, with all that is manly and useful; with 'uhatfoever things are true, are jufA , are pure, are lovely, are of good report, wherever there is any virtue, and wherever there is any praire. Of fuch'"
"religion discover, on every proper occasion, that you are not ashamed; but avoid making any unnecessary ostentation of it before the world, ,"
"II. To piety, join modesty and docili ty, reverence of your parents, and submission to those whd are your fuperiourst in knowledge, in flation, and in years."
"Dependence and obedience belong to youth. Modesty is one of its chief ornaV1 ments; and has ever been efleemed a pted ., sage of rising merit. When entering on the career of life, it is your parti not to assume the reins as yet into your hands; but to commit yourselves to the guidancq of the more experienced, and to become wife by the wisdom of those who have gone before you."
", Of all the follies incident to youthl there are none which either deform its present appearance, or blast the profpe4 of its future prosperity, more than felfj conceit, presumption, and obstinacy. By checking its natural progress in improvement, they fix it in long. immaturity; and frequently produce mifchiefs, which can never be repaired. Yet these are vices too commonly found among the young, Big with enterprise, and elated by hope, they resolve to trust for success to none but themselves. Full of their own abilh ties, they deride the admonitions which are given them by their friends, as the timorous suggestions of age. Too wife to learn, too impatient to deliberate, too forward to be restrained, they plinge, "
"with precipitant indiscretion, into the midst of all the dangers with which life abounds. Seeft thou a young man wife ir his own conceit ? There is more hope of a fool, than of him.--Pofitive as you now are in your opinions, and confident in youx assertions, be assured, that the time approaches, when both men and things will appear to you in a different light. Many characters which you now admire, will, by and by, fink in your esteem; and many opinions, of which you are at present moit tenacious, will alter as you advance in years. Distrust, therefore, that glare of youthful presumption, which dazzles your eyes. Abound not in your own sense. Put not yourselves forwar4 with too much eagerness; nor imagines that by the impetuosity of juvenile ardour, you can overturn systems which have been long established, .and change the face of the world. Learn not to think more highly of yourselves than you ought to."
"Think, but to think soberly. By patient and gradual progression in improvementt yotl ' may, in due time, command lasting efteent."
"But by assuming at present, a tond of superiority, to which you have no title, you will disgust those whose approbatioh it is most important to gain. Forward vivacity may fit you to be the companions of an idle hour. More solid qualities must recommend you to the wife, and mark you out for importance and confideratiou ih subsequent life."
"IlI. IT is necessary to recommend to you, sincerity and truth. This is the basis of every virtue., That darkness of charater, where we can fee no heart; those boldings of art, through which no native affetion is allowed to penetrate, present an objea, unamiable in every season of life, but particularly odious in youth. If, at an age when the heart is warm, when the emotions are strong, and when nature is expeaed to show itself free and open, you can already smile and deceive, what are we to look for, "
"when you shall be longer hackneyed in the ways of men; when interest shall have ....i pleted the obduration of your heart, and experience shall have improved you in all the arts of guile ? Dissimulation in youth, is the fore-runner of perfidy in old age. Its frft appearance, is the fatal omen of growing depravity, and future fhamq. It degrades parts and learning; obscures the lustre of every accomplishment; and sinks you into contempt with God, and man."
"SAs you-value, therefore, the approbation of Heaven, or the efleem of the world, cultivate the love of truth. In all your proceedings, be direCt and consistent."
"Ingenuity and candour possess the most powerful charm; they bespeak universal favour, and carry an apology for almost every failing. The lip of truth, shall be eflabli/fed for ever ; but a lying tongue, is but for a moment *. The path of truth, is a plain and a safe path; that of falsehood, is a perplexing maze. After the first departure from sincerity, it is not in your  power to flop. One artifice unavoidably - leads on to another; till, as the intricacy of the labyrinth increases, you are leftentangled in your own snare. Deceitdif.-"
"covers a little mind, which flops at tem."
"porary expedients, without rising to comr prehenfive views of condut., It betrays, at the fame time, a dastardly spirit. It is the resource of one, who wants courageto avow his designs, or to reft upon himself. Whereas, openness of characer difplays that generous boldness, which ought to diftinguifll youth. To set out in thd world with no other principle than a crafty attention to interest, betokens one who is destined for creeping through the inferiour walks of life. But to give an early preference to honour above gain, when they fland in competition; to despise every advantage, which cannot be attained without dishonest arts; to brook no meanness, and to sloop to no dissimulation; are the indications of a great mind, the presages of future eminence and diftinaCion ir .life."
"At the fame time, this virtuous sincerity is perfealy consistent with the most pru- I.."
"dent vigilance and caution. It is opposed to cunning, not to true wisdom. It is not the simplicity of a weak and improvident, but the candour of an enlarged and noble mind; of one, who scorns deceit, because he accounts it both base and unprofitable; and who seeks no disguise, because he needs none to hide him. 'Lord! whoJjhall abide in thy tabernacle? Who hall ascend into thy holy hill? He that walketh uprightly, and wvorketh righteousness, and fpeaketh the truth in his heart.
  is the proper season of cultivating the benevolent and humane affe&ions. As a great part of your happinefs is to depend on the conne&ions which you form with others, it is of high importance that you acquire, betimes, the temper and the manners which will render such connetions comfortable. gLet a sense of justice be the foundation of all your social qualities. In your most early  intercourse with the world, and eveq fit _ your youthful amusements, let no unfairl ness be found. Engrave on your mind that sacred rule, of doing in all things So others, *qccording as you, wji that the4, Jhould do unto you./ For this end, inmpreft yourselves with a deep sense of the original, and natural, equality of men. What!
ever advantages of birth or fortune yot possess, never display them with an oftentatious superiority. Leave the fubordii nations of rank, to regulate the intercourse of more advanced years. At present, 4 becomes you to aat among your companions, as man with man. Remember how pnknown to you are the vicissitudes of the world; and how often they, on whom ignorant and contemptuous young men once looked down with scorn, have risen to. be their fuperiours in future years.
SCompaffion is an emotion, of which you ought never to be ashamed. Graceful in youth is the tear of sympathy, and the heart that melts at the tale of ypoe.
Let not ease and indulgence contrac your affe4ions, and wrap you up in felfifh en- ER 
joyimeat. But go sometimes to the house xI fmourning, as well as to the houfe'offeafling, Accustom yourselves to think of the distresses of human life;' of the solitary cottage, the dying parent, and the weeping orphan, Thou Jhalt not harden thy heart, nor jhut thy hand from thy poor brother ; but thou halt firely give unto him in the day of his need: And thine heart jhall not be grieved when thou gives/ unto him; because that for this thing, the Lord thy God jball bless thee in all thy works*. Never sport with pain and distress, in any of your amusements; nor treat even the meanest infea, with wanton cruelty.

In young minds, there is commonly a firong propensity to particular intimacies and friendships. Youth, indeed', is the season wheq friendships are sometimes formed, which not only continue through succeeding life, but which glow to the last, with a tendernels unknown to the connections begun in cooler years. The propensity therefore is not to be difcou, 




 raged; though at the fame time it (nuft XI _ be regulated with much circumfpe0ioa and care. Too many of the pretended friendships of youth, are mere combinae tiona in pleasure. They are often f0undr on capricious likings; suddenly 0on*
trated, and as suddenly dissolved. Sometimes they are the effea of interested comn plaifance and flattery on the one  and of credulous fondness on the other. Be, ware of such rash and dangerous cpnnections, which may afterwards load you with di(honour. Remember, that by thý charader of those whom you choose for your friends, your own is likely to be formed, and will certainly be judged of by the world. Be flowv, therefore, and cautious in contracing intimacy; but when a virtuous friendship is once eflablifhed, confider it as a sacred engagement, Expose not yourselves to the reproach of lightness and inconflancy, which alwayi bespeak, either a trifling, or a base mind.
Reveal none of the secrets of your friend.
Be faithful to his interests. Forsake hin tiot in dangei. Abhor the thought bs ac- SE IM.
quiring any advantage by his prejudice  
or hurt. There is a friend that loveth at all times, and a brother thdt is born for verfity. Thine own friend, and thyfather friend, forsake not '.

Finally, on this head; in order to ren dier yourselves amiable in society, correCt every appearance of harshness in behaviour. Let that courtesy distinguish your demeanour, which springs, not so much from fludied politeness, as from a mild and gentle heart. Follow the customs of the world in matters indifferent; but flop when they become sinful. Let your manners be simple and natural; and of course they will be engaging. Affe6tation is certain deformity. By forming themselves on fantastic models, and vying with one another in every reigning folly, the young begin with being ridiculous, and end in being vicious and immoral.
  LET Ite particularly exhort youth to temperance in pleasure: Let me * prov. xvii. 17.-xxvii. 1o.

\FR  monish them, to beware of that rock on  ' which thousands, from race to race, con tinue to split. The love of pleasure, natural to man in every period of his Jife, glows at this age with excessive ardour, Novelty adds fresh charms, as yet, to eve ry gratification. The world appears to spread a continual feast; and health, vigour, and high spirits, invite them tq partake of it without restraint. In vain we warn them of latent dangers. eligion is accused of infufferable severity, in prohibiting enjoyment; and the ol, when they offer their admonitions, arq, upbraided with having forgot that they once were young.-And yet, my friends, to what do the restraints of religion, and the counsels of age, with refpea to pleasure, amount ? They may all be comprized in few words, not to hurt yourselves, and not to hurt others, by your pursuit of pleasure, Within these bounds, pleasure is lawful; beyond them, it becomes criminal, because it is ruinous.
Are these restraInts any other, than what a wife man would choose to impose on him- sE .

self? We call you not to renounce pleasure, but to enjoy it in fafery. Instead of abridging it, we exhort you to pursue it on an extensive plan. We propose measures for securing its poffeffion, and for prolonging its duration.

Consult your whole nature. Confider yourselves not only as sensitive, but as rational beings; not only as rational, but social; not only as social, but immortal. Whatever violates your nature in any of these refpedts, cannot afford true pleasure; any more than that which undermines an essential part of the vital system, can promote health. For the truth of this conclusion, we appeal, not merely to the authority of religion, nor to the testimony of the aged, but to yourselves and your own experience.
We ask, Whether you have not found, that in a course of criminal excess, your pleasure was more than compensated by fucceeding pain ? Whether, if not from every particular inflance, yet from every habit, 
at least, of unlawful gratification, there did . .- not spring some thorn to wound you, there did not arise some consequence to make you repent of it in the issue ? How long then, yes mple ones! will ye love implicity ? How long repeat the fame round of pernicious folly, and tamely expose yourselves to be caught in the fame snare ? If you have any consideration, 'or any firmness left, avoid temptations, for which you have found yourselves unequal, with as much care, as you would fiun pestilential infeaion. Break off all connetions with the loose and proi fligate. When sinners entice thee, consent thou not. Look not on the wine when it is red, when it giveth its colour in the cup; for at the laJf, it biteth like a serpent, and fJingeth like an adder. Remove thy wiay from the frange woman, and come not *ear the door of her house. Let not thine heart decline to her ways,; for her house is the vway to hell. Thou goefJ after her as a bird bafleth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

By these unhappy excesses of irregular pleasure in youth, how many amiable -
positions are corrupted or destroyed! How many rising capacities and powers are sup.
pressed! How many flattering hopes of pa.
rents and friends, are totally extinguished !
Who but must drop a tear over human nature, when he beholds that morning which arose so bright, overcast with such untimely darkness; that good humour which once captivated all hearts, that vivacity which sparkled in every company, those abilities which were fitted for adorning the highest flation, all sacrificed at the thrine of low sensuality; and one who was formed for running the fair career of life in the midst of public efleem, cut off by his vices at the beginning of his course, or funk, for the whole of it, into infignificancy .and contempt !-These, 0 sinful Pleasure! are thy trophies. It is thus that, co-operating with the foe of God and man, thou degradeft human honour, and blafteft the opening profpe ts of human felicity.


SER * /  DILIGENCE, indufiry, and propet ~ improvement of time, are material dutiel of the young. To no purpose are they endowed with the best abilities, if they want aaivity for exerting them,,- Utp availing, in this cafe, will be every direcr that can be given them, either for their temporal or spiritual welfare, Ia youth, the habits of industry are moo easily acquired. In youth, the incept tives to it are firongeft, from ambitioc and from duty, from emulation and hope, from all the profpe 'which the pegin, ning of life affords. If, dead to these calls, you already languish in flotbfWl inaaion, what will be able to quicken the more sluggish current of advancing years ?

Industry is not only the instrument of improvement, but the foundation of pleasure. Nothiog is so opposite to the true enjoyment of life, as the relaxed and feeble slate of an indolent mind.
He who is a firanger to industry, mpq possess, but he cannot enjoy. For it is labour only which givei the relish to pleasure. It is the appointed vehicle bs every good to man. It is the indifpenfable condition of our poffefling a found mind, in a found body. Sloth is so inconsistent with both, that it is hard to determine whether it be a greater foe to virtue, or to health and happiness. Inactive as it is in itself, its effets are fatally powerful. Though it appear a slowly flowing stream, yet it undermines all that is flable and flouri(hing. It not only saps the foundation of every virtue, but pours upon you a deluge of crimes and evils. It is like water which first pu-»
trifies by stagnation; and then sends up noxious vapours, and fills the atmosphere with death.

Fly, therefore, from idleness, as the certain parent both of guilt and of ruin.
And under idleness I include, not mere inaaion only, but all that circle of trifling occupations, in which ' too many saunter away their youth; perpetually engaged in frivolous society, or public amusements, in the labours of dress, o4 »- the ostentation of their pqrfons.-I4 tbif the foundation which you lay son fture ufefulnefs and esteem ? By such pcPqm4 pljfhments, do you hope to recqnupend yourselves to the thinking part of the world, and to answer the expeSations of your friends, and your country ,    Amusements, youth requires. It were vain, it were cruel to proihiit themn But. though allowable as the relaxation, they are most culpable as the business, of the young, For they then become the gulf of time, and the poison of thd mind, They foment bad pafions. They weaken the manly powers. They fink the native vigour of youth, into con4 temptible effeminacy.

Redeeming your time from such, dan-q gerous wafite, seek to fill it with employments which you may review with fatiffadion./ The acquisition of knowledgeis one of the most honourable occupations of youth. The desire of it discoversa, liberal mind, and is conne6ted with many accomplishments, and many virtues. 

But though your train of life should not lead you to fludy, the course of education always furnishes proper employments to a well-difpofed mind. Whatever you pursue, be emulous to excel. Generous ambition, and sensibility to praise, are, efpecially at your age, among the marks of virtue. Think not, that any affluence of fortune, or any elevation of rank, exempts you from the duties of application and industry. Industry is the law of our.
being; it is the demand of Nature, of Reason, and God.l2Remember always, that the years which now pass over your heads, leave permanent memorials behind them. From your thoughtless minds they may escape; but they remain in the remembrance of God. They form an importarft part of the regiffer of your life.
They will hereafter bear teflimony, either for or against you, at that day, when, for all your aaions, but particularly for the employments of youth, you must give an account to God.


THUs I have set before you, some of  the chief qualifications which belong to that sober mind, that virtuous and religibus charaaer, which the Apostle in my Text recommends to youth i piety, mqdefty, truth, benevolence, tgmperapce, and industry. Whether your future courfp is defined to be long or flort, after thip manner it should commence; and, if,ý continue to be thus conduted, its Pon, clufion, at what time soever it arriveS will not be inglorious or unhappy. For, honourable age is not thatl which Jflandet4 in length of time, or that which is meat sured by number of years. But wisdom jthe gray hair to man, and an unspotted lifr is old age.
 me finish the fubjea, with recall-ý your attention to that dependence op the blessing of Heaven, which, amidst all your endeavours after improvement, you ought continually to preserve, It is too comatioa with the young, even when they resolve to tread the path of virtue and ho fidence' in themselves. Trusting to their own abilities for carrying them fucceflfully thlotugh fife, they are careless of applying to God, or of deriving any asfiflance from' what' they are apt to reckon the gloomy discipline of religion. Alas!
how littfe do thley know the dangers which await tiem ? Neither human wisdom, nor htman virtue, unsupported by religion, are equal' for the trying situations which often'occur in life. By the shock of temptation, how frequently have the most virtuous intentions been overthrown ? Unler the prffure of disaster, how often has the greatest conflancy funk ? Every good, and every perfeR gift, is from above. Wisdom and virtue, as' well as riches and honour, come from God. Deffitute of his favour, you are in no better situation, with all your boasted abilities, than orphans left to wander in a trackless desert, without any guide to conduc them, or any shelter to cover them from the gathering storm. Corret, then, this ill-founded ar 

 rogance. Expe& not, that your happiness '_ can be independent of him who made youth. By faith and repentapce, apply to the Redeemer of the world. By piety and prayer, seek the protetion of the God of heaven. I conclude with the folerni words, in which a great Prince delivered his dying charge to his son; words, which every young person ought to confider as addressed to himself, and to engrave deeply on his heart. Thou Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy fathers; and serve him with a perfeRl heart, andiwt-~
a willing mind. For the Lord fearcheth all hearts, and underfiandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou seek hbmw he will be found of thee; but if thou forAke him, he will carj thee offor ever*.

# SERMON XII. On the Duties and Consolations of the Aged.

## PROV. xvi. 31. The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.

 fear God, and to keep his command- 

ments, is the rule of our duty, in -

every period of life. But, as the light which guides our fleps, varies with the progress of the day, so the rule of religious condu& is diversified in its application, by the different stages of our present existence. To every age, there belongs a diftind propriety of behaviour.
There arises from it, a series of duties peculiar to itself.

Of those which are incumbent on . ,. youth, I have treated in. the preceding discourse. As,we advance from yputh to middle age, a new field of aaion opens, and a different charaaer is required. jThe flow of gay and impetuous spirits begins to subside: Life gradually assumes a graver cast; the mind, a more sedate and thoughtful turn. The -attention is now transferred from pleasure to interest; that is, to pleasure diffufed over a wider extent, and meafpre4 by a larger scale.. orner ly, the enjoytent of the present mopmnt occupied the whole attention. Now, no SaLion terminates ultimately in itself, but refers to some more distant aim. Wealth and power, the instruments of lfting gratification, are now coveted more than any single pleasure. Prudence and,forefight lay their plans. Industry carries on its, patient efforts. Acivity pushes forward; address winds around, Hereý aa_ enemy is to be overcome; there a rival to be displaced. Competitions warm; and thb firife of the world thickens on every  To guide men throbgh this busy SER MI.

SBut as this includes, in a great mea-1 fire, the whole compass of moral duty; as the general firain of religious exhortatign oi addressed to those who are in this'
feaifonrdf life; a idelineation of the virtlesf, properly belonging to middle age, may appear unnecessary, and would lead ut into too wide a field. Let us therefore tarrr our view to a bounded profpe&; afad contemplate a period of life, the duties of which are circumscribed within narrower limits. Old age is a stage of the human course, which every one hopes to reach4 and therefore the confideratiotf of'it, interests us alL It is a period justly entitled tuo general refpet. Even its failings 6ught to be touched with a gentle hand; and though the petulant, and the sb 4 vain, "
"19 JM. vainm, my defplfe'the h6aj head~ yeIthie eLj » wileft of men has asserted wint thP'Ot  "
"that when found in the -way bs tghieoiffness, it is a crown of glbry. 1 Ihill, 7i  offer, some counsels, concetanig the titdis which are most incident to ihe 6ged. Secondly, I shall suggest the- peculiar diutis they ought to praaife; and, thidly, p6ift anout the consolations they' may enjoy 1 1. As -the folliet and vices of yoth, 
are chiefly derived from inexperince 4ad presumption; so, almost all the errors of age, may be traced up to the feebleness -and diflrefs peculiar to that time of life.
Though, in every part of fifi, vexatiosn .occur, yet, in former years,? eithir bui.
ness, or pleasure, served to obliterate their impression, by supplying occupationlto the mind. Old age begins its adar~ges, With disqualifying men for Telilhing the Sone, and for takirg an a&ive partvin tlhe .6t1her. While it withdraws their ac4uitomed supports, it imposes, at. the, fame time, the additional burden ofi growing ,infirmities. In the former stages of their 9, jou1neyj hope continued to flatter thems =
.:bthAmany a fair and enticing profped.
Afut in proportion as old age increases, -thpfe pleasing illusions vanilh, Life is..antraeed within -a narrpw and barren zsir4oe. Year after year, fleals somewhat AtWay fromn their store of comfort, '"
"prives them of some of their ancient friends, blunts some of their'powers- of sensation, pr incapacitates them. for some bfdnajo of life."
"Io. Though, in the plan of Providence, ,it eis -wifely ordered, that before we are lled away from the world, our attachxment to it should be gradually loosened; though it be fit in, itself, that .as in the day of human life, there is a morning and a noon, so there should be an evening also, when the lengthefiing shadows ihall admonish us of approaching night; yet we have no ,eafon to be surprised, if they who are arrived at this dejeaing fao, feel and lament the chauge which they, fuffer. The complints, - therefore, "
"of the aged, Thould meettwith tenderness, "
"-.-uj rather .thain censure4 The burden under which they labouri ought to be viewed with sympathy, by those who must beat it in their turn, and who perhaps, here."
"after, an complain of it as bitterly. At the fame timee the old should confidet, that all the seasons of life have their feveral trials allotted to them; and that to bear the infirmities of age with becoming patience, is as much their duty, as it is that of the young to resist the temptations of youthful pleasure. By calmly enduring, for the fh6rt time that remains, what Providence is' pleased to inflit, they both exprefsr resignation most acceptable to .God, and recommend rthemfelveis io the efteenm and assistance of all who are mround them, - '"
"But though the cjuertilous temper im puted ito old age, is to be considered is natural infirinity, rather than as a vice the famd apology cannot be made foi* that peevith disgust at the manners, and that malignant censure of the enjoyihentsl of ;he young, which is sometimes found to 8 ER "
"accopmpany declining years. Nothing cad bA more 3njuft, than to take offence at others, on acpount of their partaking of pleafureq, which it is past your time to enjoy. By indulging this fretful temper, ypu both aggravate the uneasiness of age, aqd you alienate those on whose affeftiot'"
"much of your comfort depends. In ordef to make the two extremes of life UnitV in amicable society, it is greatly to, be vilhed, that the young would look forrward, and cpnfider that they shalL one?
day be old; and that the old w6uld lookr back, and remembering that they once'
were young, make proper allowances for the temper and the manners of youth.

But infl;ead of this, it is too common to find the aged at declared enmity witfh the whole.fyfiem of,prefent customs and magnnr§; perpetually complaining of the growipg depprvity of the world, and of the astonishing, vices and follies of the rising gneration. All thbngs, according to them,, are rufhipg fast into ruin. 
1 tint, ever since that happy discipline, 
under which they spent their youth, has passed away.---Part, at least, of this displeasure, ypu may fairly impute to the infirmity of age, which throws its own gloom on every surrounding oqbjec1. 'Si milar lamentations were, in the' days of your youth, poured forth by your fathers; and they who are now young, shall, when it comes to their turn, inveigh, in the like strain, againtf those who fucceea them. Great has been the corruption of the world in every age. Sufficient ground'
there is for the complaints made by ferious observers, at all times, of abounding iniquity and folly. But though particular modes of vice prevail in one agd, more than in'others, it does not follow, that dn that age all iniquity is accumulated.
It is -the form, perhaps, more than the quatity of corruption, which 'makes the diftintion. In the wdRfi of times, God hasaiffuredusr- that there shall be always a feed whoJhall serve hinm Say not thou, 
.ro * Pil. xxii. 30.

What is the caife hat the former days were  better thqn these ? for thou dofj not enquire -,

iely concerning this. Be not righteous over-much ; neither make thyself over- wis *,
Former follies pals away, and, are forgotten. Those which are present, firike -observation, and Iharpen censure. Had the depravation of the world continued to ian crease in proportion to those gloomy calY culations, which, for so many centuries paftG have estimated each race as worse than the precedipg; by this time, not one ray of, good sense, nor one spark of piety and vir.-1 tue, must have remained unextinguifhed among ipankind.

One of the vices of old age, which ap-"
"pears the most unaccountable, is that covetous attachment to worldly interest, with which it is often charged. But this too, can naturally be deduced from the sense of its Feebleness and decay. In proportion as the vigour both of body and mind declines, timidity may he expeaed to increase. With anxioup and fearful eye, the aged look fort  ward- to the evils which thfeater thent, "
"a' nd to the changes which nafay bedal."
"Hence, they are sometimes apt to o4rvalue riches, as the inftrunment of their defence agaiaft these dangers, and as thd most certain means of fecurfng them-' -"
"gainft solitude and difrefped. But though their dpprehenfions may justify a catitious frugality, they can by no means excute a sordid avarice. It is no less absurd, than it is culpable, in the old, from thd dread of uncertain futurity, to deny themselves the enjoyment of the present; and to increase in anxiety about their'"
"journey, in proportion as it draws nearer to its close. There are more effecual methods of commanding refpet from the world, than the mere poffeffion of wealth."
"Let them be charitable, and do good."
"Let them mix beneficence to their friends, witlh a cheerful enjoyment of' the comforts which befit their flate They 'will the rreceive the* returns off real refpd&"
"andl love. Whereas, I by their riches, they procure no more than pretended demonstrations of regard; while their ill- "
"judged parsimony occasions many secret '"
"wishes for their death."
"As increasing years debilitate the bo dy, so they weaken the force, and diminith the warmth of the affeaions. Chillpd by the hand of time, the heart loses that tender sensibility, with which it once entered into the concerns and forrows.of others. It is, in truth, a merciful appqintment of Providence, that as they who fee many days, muff behold many a.fad scene, the impressions of grief upon, their heart should be blunted by being often repeated; and that, in proportion, as their power of advancing the profperty of others decrease, their participation of the misfortupes of others should also lessen. However, as, in every period of life, humanity and friendship contribute to happiness, it is both the duty and the interest of the aged, to cherish the remains of the kind affections; and, from the days of former years, to recall such impressions as may  tend to soften their hearts. Let thenm .  not, from having' uffered much in thp course of their long pilgrimage, becomp callous to the fufferings of others. But, remembering that they flill are men, let them study to keep their heart open to the sense of human woe. Praiifed; in the ways of men, they are apt to be suspicious of. design and fraud; for the knowledge, and the distrust of mankind, too often go together. Let not, how*"
"ever, that wary caution, which is the fruit of their experience, degenerate into craft. Experience ought also to have taught them, that amidst all the falsehood of men, integrity is the best defence; and that he who continueth to the end to walk uprightly, shall continue to walk surely."
"Having thus offered some admonitions concerning the errors most incident to age, I proceed, "
"II. To point out the duties which pecu liarly belong to it."
"r The drft whleln I shall mention) is, a timely retreat from the worfd. In every _ akrt ot life, We are in hazard of being to6 deeply immersed in its cares. But, during  vigofous periods, the iropule of adive spirit, the necessary business of our ftatiori, fatd the affowable endeavours to advanoe Wr fortune by fair industry,* render it difficulo to pbferve due moderation; In old ig>, all the motives of eager pursuit diminilh, The voice of Nature then calls yot $4 leave to others the buffle and contest of the ~Prlds and gradually to disengage y04jffqyes fr a burden, which begins to eqeed, Xopf strength. Having born your jhare of the heat-and labour of the day, let the evening of life be passed in the cool and quiet shade. It is only in the shade, that the virtues of old age can flourish. There, its dutieý are discharged with most success; and here, its comforts are enjoyed with greatest fatisfadtion."
"By the retreat of old age, however, I do nbt mean a total ceffjtion from every worldly employment. There is an error - - in this, as well as in the opposite etreme."
"Persons who have been long harassed with business and care, sometimes imagine, that -when life declines, they cannot make their retirement from the world too complete."
"But where they expeded a delicious enjoyment of leisure and ease, they have often found a melancholy solitude. Few are able, "
"in any period of their days, to bear a f0al abftradion from the world. There remains a vacancy, which they cannot fill up."
"Incapable of being always employed in the exercises of religion, and often little qualified for the entertainments of the understanding, they are in hazard of becoming a burden to themselves, and to all With whom they are conne  It is, therefore, the duty of the aged, not so much to withdraw entirely from wdrldly bhfineis, as to contra& its circle; not so much to break off, as to loosen their communication with adive life. Cbntinuing that train of occupation to which they have been most accustomed, let them purrfue it with less intenseness; relaxing their efforts, as their powers decline- retiring more and more, froth publick 9bfervation, to domestic scenes, and serious thoughts,' till, as the decays - life advarce, the world ihall of itself withdraw to a greater diflance from their yiew-, its objeds ihall gradually yield their place to others of more importance; and its tumults shall found in their ears, -oply like a noise which is heard from afar."
"If it be the duty of the old, to retreat betimes from the fatigue of worldly care, jt is still more incumbent on them, to quit the pursuit of such pleasures as are unsuitable so their years. Cheerfulness, in old age, is graceful. It is the natural p9naomitant of virtue. But the cheerfulpefs of age is widely different from the levity of youth. Many things are allowable in that early period, which$ in maturer years, would deserve cerfure; but yich,, in old age, become both ridiculous and criminal. By awkwardly affeding XI. to imitate the manners, and to mingle in the vanities of the young, as the aged \depart from the dignity, so they forfeit."
"the privileges of gray hairs. But if, by follies of this kind, they are degradedf they are exposed to much deeper blamer by descending to vicious. pleasure, andcontinuing to hover round those sinful gratifications to which they were ohce addiced. Amusement and relaxation the aged require, and may'enjoy. But let them confider well, that by every infemperate indulgence, they accelerate decay; instead of enlivening, they oppress, and precipitate, their declining state. Ease, safety, and refpe&, are the proper enjoyments of age, Within these boinds let it remain, and not vainly attempt to break through that barrier, by which nature has separated the pleasures of youth, from the comforts left to the concluding years of life."
"A material part of the duty of the aged, consists, in fludying to be useful to thes race who are to succeed them. "
"Here opens to them an extensive field "
"in which they may so employ themselves, as considerably to advarice the interest of religion, and the happiness of mankind."
"To them it belongs, to impart to the young the fruit of their long experience; to inftru6t them in the proper condu6t, and to warn them of the various dangers, of life; by wife counsel, to temper their precipitate ardour; and, both by precept and example, to form them to piety and virtue."
"It is not by rigorous discipline, and unrelaxing austerity, that they can maintain an ascendant over youthful minds."
"The constraint which their presence will impose, and the aversion which their manners will create, if the one be conftantly awful, and the other severe, tend to frustrate the effect of all their wisdom."
"They muff assume the spirit of the companion, and the friend; and mix with the authority of age, a proper degree of indulgence to the manners of the young."
"Inflead of lessening the refpe due to  . their years by such condescension, they take the surest method to increase it. Old age never appears with greater dignity than, when tempered by mildness, and enlivened with good humour, itas as the guide and the patron of youth. Reti gion displayed in such a charater, frikes the beholders, as at once ,amiable and venerable. They revere its power, wvbea they fee it adding so much grace to the decays of nature, and shedding so pleating a lultre over the evening of life. The young wish to tread in the fame steps, and to arrive at the close of their days -with equal honour. They listen with attention to counsels, which are mingled with tenderness, and rendered refpetable by gray hairs. For, notwithstanding all its presumption, youth naturally bends before fuperiour knowledge and years."
"Aged wisdom, when joined with acknovledged virtue, exerts an authority over the human mind, greater even than that . hich arises from power and flation. I Jt can check the most forward, abash the most WI profligate, and itrike with awe the molt 1, giddy and unthinking."
"In the midst of their endeavours to be fifeful to others, let not the aged forget those religious employments,' which their own slate particularly requires. The first of these, is, refletion on their past beha-."
"viour, with a view to discover the errors which they have committed; and, as far as remaining life allows, to apply themselves to repentance and amendment.-"
"Long has the world bewildered you in its maze, and imposed upon you by its arts."
"The time is now come, when this great seducer should mislead you no more."
"From the calm station at which you are arrived, sequestered from the crowd of the deceiving and the deceived, review your condua, with the eye of Christians and immortal beings. After all the tumult of life is over, what now remains to afford you solid fatisfaaion ? 'Have you served God with fidelity, and discharged your part to your fellow-creatures with integrity- and a good conscience ? Cart - you look forward, without terrour, to that day which is to dissolve your connedion with this world, and to bring you into the presence of him who made you, in order to give account of your acions ?-The retrofpe& of life is seldom wholly unattended by uneasiness and shame. Though, to the gdod and the bad, it presents a very different scene; yet, to all men, it recalls much guilt incurred, and much time mifpent. It too much resembles the review, which a traveller takes from some eminence, of a barren country, through which he has passed, where the heath and the defar; form the chief profped; diversified only by a fevw scattered spots of imperfea cultivation."
"Turn then your thoughts, to the proper nethods of making your peace with God through Jesus Christ; and implore, from Divine grace, that new heart, and right spirit, which will fit you for 'a better world. Let devotion fill up many of those hours, which are now vacant from worldly business and care. Let your asfetions dwell among divine and immortal objets. In silent and thoughtful meditation, walk as on the shore of that vast ocean, upon which you are soon to embark. Summon up all the confiderations, which should reconcile you to your departure from life; and which may prepare you for going through its last scene, with firmness and decency. Often let your thanksgivings ascend to .God, for that watchful care with which he hath hitherto conduaed you, through the long journey of life. Often let your prayers be heard, that, in what remains of your pilgrimage, he may not forsake you; and that, when you enter into the 'valley of thejhadow of death, he may there support you with his flaf, and defend you with his rod.-Amidft such thoughts and cares, let old age find you employed; be'taking yourselves to a prudent and timely retreat; disengaged, both from the oppreffive load of business, and from the unseasonable pursuit of pleasure; apply, Sipg yourselves to form the succeeding race, by your counsels virtue and wis, dom; reviewing seriously your past life;by repentance and devotion, preparing yourfelves'for a better; and, with hum, ble and manly composure, expeting that hour, which Nature cannot now long des lay. It remains, "
"III. To suggest the consolations whicl belong to pld age, when thus fo4ld in tke way of righteousness."
"I must introduce them with observing, "
"That nothing is rpore reasonable in itself*"
"than to submit patiently to those infirmities of Nature, which are brought on by the increase of years. You knew before, hand what you had to expet, when you numbered the successive Summers and Winters which were passing over ypur ,heads. Old age did not attack you by surprise, nor was it forced upon you against your choice. Often, and earnestly, did you wiih to fee long lif, and many days. When arrived at the desired period, "
"have you any just cause to complain, on account of enduring what the conflitution of bur being imposes on all ? Did you expe6t, that,. for your fake, Providence wasto alter its eflablifhed order ? Throughout the whole vegetable, sensible, and rational world, whatever makes progress towards maturity, as soon as it has ,passed that point, begins to verge towards decay. It is as natural for old age to be frail, as for the corn to bend under the ripened ear, or for the autumnal leaf to change its hue. To this law, all who went before you, have submitted; and all who shall come after you, must yield. After they have flourished for a season, they Ihall fade, like you, when  period of decline arrives, and bow under the pressure of During the whole progress of the hu man course, the principal materials of our comfort, or uneasiness, lie within ourselves. Every age will prove burdensome, to those who have no fund of happiness sE  in their own breast. Preserve them, if you 'I. . could, from all infirmity of frame; begow upon them, if it were possible, perpetual youth; still they would be restless and miserable, through the influence of illgoverned passions. It is not surprising, that such persons are peevish, and querulous,,"
"when bid. Unjuffly they impute to their time of life, that. misery with which their vices and follies embitter every age, Whereas, to good men, no period of life is unsupportable, because they draw their chief happiness from sources which are independent of age or time. Wisdom, piety, and virtue, grow not old with our bodies, - They fuffer no decay from length of days."
"To them only belongs unalterable and unfading youth. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord, Jhall flourih in the courts of our God. They Jhall fill bring forth fruit in old age; theyJhall be fat and ]louri/hing *."
"You can now, it is true, no longer re lith many of those pleasures which once * Pfal. xii. 13, 14. amused amused you. Your sensations are less ."
"quick than formerly; your days more languishing. But if you have quitted the region of pleasure, in return, you possess that of tranquillity and repose. If you are strangers to the vivacity of enjoyment, you are free,' at the fame time, from the pain of violent and often disappointed desire. Much fatigue, much vexation, as well as vanity, attend that turbulence of life, in which the younger 'part of mankind are engaged. ' Amidst those keen pursuits, and seeming pleasures, for which you envy them, often they feel their own misery, and look forward with a wishful eye to the season of calmness and retreat."
"For, on all sides of human life, the balance of happiness is adjusted with more equality than at first appears; and if old age throws some new distresses into the scale, it lightens also the weight of others."
"Many passions, which formerly disturbed your tranquillity, have now subsided."
"Many competitions, which long filled your days with disquiet and frife, are now SER RM at an end. Many.afflidions, wiich once A;rL ^ rent yonr hearts with violent anguish are now softened into a tender emotion, on the remenmbuance of past woe. In the be.,"

From this inftruaive passage of hifto*

ry, the following observations naturally arise. I. That a sense of right and wrong in conduac, or of moral good and evil, belongs to human nature.  That it produces an apprehension, of merited pu.
nifhment, when we have committed evill IlL That although this .inward sentiment be stifled during the season of profperityi yet, in adversity, it will revive. Andi  That whent it revives, it determines us to confider every distress which we susser, from what cause soever it has arifenj as an adual infliaion of punishment by Ieaven. The consideration of these particulars, will lead us to a very serious view of the nature of man, and of the government of God.
 THERE belongs to human nature, at sense of moral good and evil, or a fa 
culty which difiinguifhes right from SE Wrong, in ation and condu&. Theyfaid, .
one to another, 'We are verily guilty.-In an age, when the law was not yet given, when no external revelation of the Divine will subsisted, except what had been banded down among the Patriarchs, from one generation to another; the brethren of Joseph reasoned concerning their condu&, upon the fame moral principles, and were affected by the fame feelings, of which we are conscious at this day.
Such sentiments are coeval with human nature; for they are the remainb of a law, which was originally written in our heart. In the darkest regions of the earth, and among the rudest tribes of men, a diflinaion has ever been made, between just and unjust, between a duty and a crime. Throughout all the intercourse of human beings, these diftinaions are supposed. They are the foundation of the mutual trust, which the tranfactions of life require; nay, the very entertainments of society constantly appeal to them. The Historian,, who fludies to I'. magnify his hero, by representing him as just and generous; the Poet/ who seeks to interest the world in his fitions, by engaging the heart in behalf of distressed virtue; are fufficient to confute the Sceptic, who denies any natural perception of a diftinaion in aaions."
"But though a sense of moral good and evil be deeply impressed on the heart of man, yet it is not of fufficient power to regulate his life. In his present corrupted state, it is both too general to afford him full direCtion in condua, and too feeble to withstand the opposition of contrary principles in his nature; It is ofted perverted, by ignorance and fuperfiition; it is too easily overcome, by passion and defire. Hence, the importance of that Divine revelation, which cbmmunicates both light and strength; which, by the inftrudive dift coveries if makes, and by the powerfiul assistance it fuppliesi it raises man to a fbation, infinitely fuperiour to that which ht poffeffes under the mere light of Nature."
"It is of consequence, however, to "
"nwark, That this revelation necessarily XI'."
"'supposes an antecedent sense bs right atid wrong to take place in the human mind."
"It addresses itself to men, as poffeffed of such a faculty; and, when it commands them, in general terms, to pursue whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are jzf, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, it plainly appeals to the native di&ates of their heart. Nay, unless men were endowed by Nature, with some sense of duty, or of moral obligation, they could reap no benefit from revelation; they would remain incapable of all religion whatever."
"For, in vain were a system of duty prefcribed to them by the word of God; allegiance were in vain required towards their Creator, or love and gratitude enjoined towards their Redeemer; if, previoufly, there was no principle in their nature, which made them feel the obli-."
"gations of duty, of allegiance, and of  gratitude. They could have no ideas cor."
"- responding to such terms; nor any conr viaion, that, independently of fear or interest, they were bound to regard, either him who made, or him who redeemed them.--This, therefore, is to be held as a principle fundamental to all religion, That there is in human nature, an approving or condemning sense of condut ; by means of which, they who have not the law, are a law unto themselves *. They who, from a mistaken zeal for the honour of Divine revelatiod,. either deny the existence, or vilify the authority, of natural religion, ire not aware, that, by disallowing the sense of obligation, they undermine the foundation, on which revelation builds its power of commanding the heart."
". The Text leads us to observe, That one of the cafes in which the natural sense of good and evil operates most forcibly, is, when men have been guilty of injustice or inhumanity. We fawr the angui of our brother foul when he besought us, and , we 'would nat hear, An' inward principle "
"prompts us to do good to. bthers; but sI with much greater authority, it checks and condemns us, when we have-done them injuries. Tbl part of the humar constitution deserves to be remarked, as a signal proof of the wisdom of its Author, and of the gracious provision which he rhas ,made for' the welfare of mankind."
"We are all committed, in some measure, to the care and assistance of one another."
"But ~ur mutual influence reaches much farther with refped to the evils, than with refpe to the enjoyments, of those around us. To advance their prosperity, ia,often beyond our ability; but to in, $fli injuries, is almost always within our power; And, at the fame time, felf-inte*"
"'eft yery frequently tempts us to commit them. With the utmost propriety, therefore, we are so framed, that the influence jos the moral principle should be most ,iuthoritative, in cafes. where its aid is onoft needed; that to promote the happiness of others, flould appear to us as praise-worthy, indeed,' and generousi; ,HL, but that, to abflain from injuring>thea,)"
"thould be felt as matter of the afri&efl duty,-Amidft the distress which thefta, triarchs fuffered in Egypt, had only this fuggeflion occurred,  We saw- our brof .ther beginning to prosper, and we sonq  tributed not to his advancement, tbei; minds would have been more easily quietl  But, when their refletion was, JV4 saw his anguish when he besought us, and we would not bear, then cofnpuntiop turned upon them its flarpeft edge. Iproceed to observe, "
"JI. A our natural sense of right and wrong, produces and apprehension of merited punishment when we have comrn mitted a crime. When it is employed in surveying the behaviour of others, it dif, linguifhes some aaions, as laudable and excellent; and disapproves of others, as evil and base. But when it is dire upon our own condua, it assumes a higher office, and exercises the authority of a2judge. It is then properly termed, . "
"Conscience; and the sentiments which \"
"itawakens, upon the perpetration of a erirhe, are tiled, Remorse. Therefore, said the brethren of Joseph, is this diflrefs come upon ujz behold also his blood is required."
"They acknowledged, not only that they had committed a wrong, but a wrong for which they were justly doomed to fuffer."
"Did not conscience suggest this natural lation between guilt and punishment, the mere principle of approbation, or difapprobation, with refpe& to moral condu&, would prove of small efficacy. For disapprobation attends, in some degree, every conviaion of impropriety of folly."
"When one has aded unsuitably to his interest, or has trespassed against the rules of prudence or decorum, he refleas upon his condud with pain, and acknowledges that he deserves blame, But the difference between the sense of mifcondua, and the sense of guilt, consists in this, That the latter penetrates.much deeper into the heart. It makes the criminal feel, "
"V-yt that he is not only blameable, but justly punishable, for the part which he has aded. With reference to this office of conscience, the inspired writers frequently speak of it, in terms borrowed foro the awful folemnities of judicial proce, dure; as, bearing -witnofs for or againfl ts-; aIccufug ar excfitmg, judging and coun demning. It will be found, that in the language of mOt nations, terms of thq fame import are applied to the operations of conscience; expressing the sense, which all mankind have) of its passing fentenrcq uipon them, and pronouncing rewards or puni'hments to be due to their adions."
"The sense of punishment merited, you?"
"are further to observe, can never be fepa, rated from the dread, that, at some time or other, punimiment shall be actually ini flided. This dread is not confined to the vengeance of man. For, let the fianer evil deeds be ever so thoroughly conceah from the knowledgq of the world, hia inward alarms are not quieted by that consideration. Now, puriffhment is the SERWf."
"faniton .of law. Every law supposes a rightful fuperiour: And therefore, wher cotncience threatens punilhment tb ferret crimes, it manifeflly recognizes a supreme Governour, from whom nothing is hidden. The belief of our being accountable to him, is what the most hardened wickedness has never been able to eradicate. It is a belief which arises, not merely from. reasoning, but from internal sentiment. Conscience is felt to a as the delegate of an invisible Ruler; both anticipating his sentence, and foreboding its execution."
"Hence arise the terrours, which so of ten haunt guilt, and rife in pioportion to its atrocity. In the history of all nations, the Tyrant and the Oppressor, the bloody and the flagitious, have been ever pointed out, as fearful, unquiet, and relless; fubjed to alarms and apprehensions of. an unaccountable Kind. And surely, io live under such disquietude, from lhe Idreadof merited punithment, is already  to undergo one of the most severe punifl I. -ments which human nature tan fuffer.

.When the world threatens us with aity -of its evils, we know the extent, trid-dif-cern the limits of the danger. We fee the -quarter, on which we are, expofed-to its attack. We measure our own strength with that of our adversary; and can .take precautions, either for making refiflance, or for contriving escape. But when an ,awakened conscience places before the inner, the just vengeance of the Almighty, the profped is confounding, because the Sdanger is boundless. It is a dark unknown which threatens him. The arm that is - stretched over him, he can neither fee nor resist. On every  he dreads it; and on every objec which surrounds him, he looks with terrour, because he is confciSous that every objet can be employed -against him as an instrument of wrath.
-No wonder that the lonesome solitude, or the midnight hour, should firike him with horrour. His troubled - mind beholds forms, which other men fee not; and hears voices, which found only in the ER 
igt of guilt. A hand appears to come (forthb and to write upon the wall ,over against him ; as it did of old, in the fight of an -impious monarch. He Jhall find no ease, nor reft. For the Lord Jhall give him a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, sand sorrow of mind: And his life /hall hang in doubt before him ; and he Jhall fear day and night, and have none assurance of his -ife: In the morning heJ 3allfay, Would to Go4 it were even; and at even heJhallfay, Would to God it were morning, for the fear of his heart wherewith he Jhall fear, and for the fight which his eyes Jhallfee, His lifeJhall be 'grievous unto him *.-Adverfity! how blunt are all the arrows of thy quiver, in comparison with those 'of guilt !-But if such be the power of cohscience, whence, it may be asked, comes it to pass, that its influence is not more genreral, either in restraining men from the commission of fin, or in leading them to a timely repentance ? This brings me to observe,; * Dpot. xxviii. '65,-66, 67. Ifa.  4.

  THAi , durifg a course ,of profpet i- I rity, the operations of conscience- are of1 ten suspended; and that adversity is the season which restores them to their pro per force. At the time when crimes ar
committed, the mind is too much heate&
by paflion, and engrossed by the object of its pursuit, to be capable of proper reflection. After this tumult of spirits haar subsided, if a train of new passions be at hand to employ its ,aivity, or a (uccefsion of pleasurable objeas occur to en--
gage its attention, it may for a while retnain, though not entirely free from inward misgivings, yet unconscious of the degree of its guilt. Dissipated among the amusements of life, the finner escapes, in some measure, from his own view. If he reflets upon himself at all, the continuance of prosperity seems to him a firong jtflification of his conduct. For it will be-found, that in the.hearts of all men, there is a natural propensity, to judge of the favour of the Supreme Being, from the course of external events. When they are born with a smooth gale along the flream of life, and behold every thing 1 proceeding according to their wish, hardly can they be brought to believe, that Providence is their enemy. Balking in the fun-Thine of prosperity, they suppose themselves to enjoy the smile bs indulgent Heaven; and fondly conclude, that they are on terms of friendflip, with all above, and with all below. Easy they find it, then, to spread over the grossest crimes, a covering, thin, indeed, and flight, yet fufficient to conceal them from a superficial 'view.

Of this we have a very remarkable in fiance, in those brethren of Joseph, whose history we now confider. Not only from the silence of the inspired writer, we have -ground to believe that their remorse was ftified, while their prosperity remained; but we are able to trace some of the presences, by which, during that period, they quieted their minds. For when they -were contriving the destruCtion of Joseph, we find Judah saying to his brethren,  ER1. What profit  it, if we flay our brotheA, - and conceal 1is blood? Let us fell him to the bmaelites; and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, and our fieh:
tAnd his brethren were content . Here you behold them justifying their drime, by a fort of pretended humanity , and making light of felling their brother for a slave, because they did not take away his life. How firangely are the dpinions of men altered, by a change in their cordition! How different is this sentiment of the Patriarchs, from that which they afterwards entertained of the fame ation, whed, as you fee in the Text, the remembrance of it wrung their hearts with ariguifh ? , 4 But men, in truth, differ as much from themselves, in prosperity, and in adverfity, as if they were different creatures.
In prosperity, every thing tends to flatter and deceive. In adversity, the illusions of life vanish. Its avocations, and its pleafures, no longer afford the finner that 'fhelter he was wont to find from confi * Gen. xxxrii. 26, 27.



ence, Formerly, he made a part of the crowd. He now feels himself a solitary individual, left alone with God, and with his own mind. His spirits are not supported, as before, by fallacious views of the favour of Heaven. The candle of the ,ord shines not on his head; his pride is humbled; and his affeaions are foftencd for -receiving every serious impression. In this situation, a man iniquity is sure to find him dut. Whatever has been notorioufly criminal in his former condu&,
rises as a fpetre, and places itself before him. The increased sensibility of his mind, renders him alive to feelings which lately were faint; and wounds which had been ill healed, bleed afresh. When men take the timbrel and the harp, and rejoice at the found of the organ, they fay, What is the Almighty that we fjouldferve him ? But when they are holden in the cords of afliEtion, then he Jfjeweth them their work, and their tranfgrefion, that they have exceeded. He openeth also their ears to discipline; and commandeth, that they return from iniquity.

Hence, we may perceive the great ufre XI fulness, and propriety, of that iritel change of conditions, which takes place'
in human life. By prosperity, Cod gives scope to our passions, and makeg trial of our dispositions. By adversity, he revives the serious principle within. Neither theone, nor the other, could be born entire and unmixed. Man, always profperouas would be giddy and insolent; always asflifted, would be sullen and despondent.
Hopes and fears, joy and fo:row; are, therefore, so blended in his life, as both to give room for worldly pursuits, and to recall, from time to time, the admonitions of conscience. Of the proportion in which they should be mixed for this purpose, we arevery incompetent judges.
From our ignorance of the degree of difcipline, which the spiritual tate of others requires, we often censure Providence unjustly, for its severity towards them:
And, from the vanity and rafhnets of our wishes,. we complain,' without reason, of Its rigour to ourselves. While we consult nothing but our ease, God attends to our spiritual improvement, ,
When we seek what is pleasing, he sends what is useful. When, by drinking too deep of worldly prosperity, we draw in a secret poison, he mercifully infuses a me-; dicine, at the time that he troubles and embitters the waters. It remains now observe,   THAT when conscience is though  
roughly awakened, it determines the finner, to confider every calamity which he fuffers, as a positive infliaion of pu, nifhment by Heaven. As it had before alarmed him with threatenings of Di.
vine displeasure, it tells him, when he falls under distress, that the threatened day of account is come. Affliaions, or some occasions, rife direaly out of our fins, Thus, diseases are brought on by intemperance; poverty - springs from idleness; and disgrace, from prefumption. In such cafes,. the punishment. is so closely conneded with the crime, that .SERM. it is imponfible to avoid difceroing the XIII. relation which the one bears to hIq other. But the appointment  Providence, which we now copfider, reaclhee farther than this. God has framed is so, that distresses, which have io perceivable connecion with our formecr crimesj are, nevertheless, interpreted Py conscience, to be infliaed on their account, They force themselves upon our apprehen}
sion, under this view. They are ,nade ýq carry, not only that degree of pain whichl properly belongs to themselves, but thaq additional torment also, which arises from the belief of their being the vengeance of the Almighty.

Let a man fall unexpeaedly into some deep calamity. Let that calamity be brought upon him, either by means which the world calls fortuitous; or by a train of incidents, in which his own mifconduQ, or guilt, has apparently had no part; yet one of the firfL queflionsi which, in such a situation, he puts t0 himself, is, What .have, I done to 

serve this ? His reflecion is, almost SE  
ffindively, drawn back upod his former -
life and if, in the course of that retrofpet, any flagrant guilty deed occur'
to, fmifd his conscience, on this he cannot avoid reffing with anxiety and terroui, and conneaing it in his imaginatIon with what he now fuffers. He fees, or thinks that he fees, a Divine arm lifted np , and what, in other circumflances, 
he would have called a reverse of fortune, he now views as a judgment of Heaven.

When the brethren of Joseph, confined in the Egyptian prison, were bewailing the distress into which they had fallen, there was no circumstance which pointed out any relation between their present misfortune, and their former cruelty to their brother. A long course of years had intervened, during which they flourished in wealth and ease. They were now far from the scene of their crime; in a foreign land, where they believed them*
selves utterly unknown, and where they  bad done nothing to offen4. cu Con science formed a connection betweeq events, -which, according to the. gr4ip nary apprehenfioan of men, were entirev ly independent,of each other.

Pious men, there is no doubt, are at all times disposed to look up to CJod, and to acknowledge his hand in every event of life. 'But what I now observe, is, That where no habitual acknowledgment of God takes place; nay, where a daring contempt of his authority has prevailed, conscience, nevertheless, constrains men, in the day of their distress, to recognize God, under the most hwful of all charaters, The avenger of past guilt.

Herein the wisdom of God appears -in such a light, as jufily to claim our highest admiration. The ordinary course of his Providence, is carried on by hu*
tnan means. He has fettled a train of events, which proceed in a regular fuc.

SS 0o the train of thought which the Text has suggested, several inferences naturally follow. But I shall confine myself to two, which claim your particular attention.

The first is, the clear evidence which the preceding observations afford, of a Divine government now exercised over mankind. This most important and awful of all truths, cannot be too often prefented to our view, or too strongly impressed on our mind. To the imperfet tonvi&ion of it, which obtains in the world, must be ascribed, in a great measurd, the& prevalence of fin. Did men firmly believe, that the Almighty Being, who formed them, is carrying on ax yfy ^ ., i - ter of adminifiration which wilt, po leave guilt unpunished, it is imppfibl8 that they could remain so jqattentiveSj we often behold them, to their moral condua. But the bulk of mankind are giddy and thoughtless. Struck by the superficial appearances of pleasure, AcI accompany licentiousness, they inquire no farther; and deliver themselves up to their senses, and their passions. Where3 as, were they to refled, but for a moment, upon that view which has now been given of human nature, they might focn be satisfied, that the moral govgrnment of God is no matter of douibtfuk difcufflon. It is a fad, no less obvious and incontestable, than the government exercised by those earthly rulers, whom we behold with the ensigns of their office before our eyes.

To govern, is to require a certait course of acion, or, to prescribe a law and to enforce that law, by a suitable diflribution of rewards and punishments.

Now,^ GSd has not only- invested SEB "
"fciehce, as we have seen, with authority to 1promulgate, but endowed it also with owwei~ io etforce, his law. By placing iitwarf approbation and peace on the of virtue, he gave it the fanaion of reward. But this was not enough. Pain is a more powertul principle, than pleasure. To escape misery, is a stronger motive for a&ion, than to obtain good."
"God, therefore,'fo framed human nature, that the painful sense of ill-defert thould attend the commission of crimes; that this sense of ill-defert should necessarily produce the dread of puni(hment; and that this dread should so operate on the mind, in the time of distress, as to make the finner conceive Providence to be erigaged against him, and to be concerned in nflicting the punishment which he fuffers. All these impressions he hath stamped upon the heart with his own hand. Ife hath made them constituent parti of our frame; on purpose, that by the union of so many strong and pungent fentinments, he might enforce repentaoce - ' and reformation, and publish to the hu man race his detestation of fin. Wete he to speak to us from the clouds, his voice could not be more decisive. What ve discern to be interwoven with the contexture of human nature, and to peryvde the whole course of human,affairs, carries an evidence not to be resifted. We might, with as much reason, doubt whether the fun was intended to enlighten the earth, or the rain, to fertilize it; as whether he,,"
"who thus framed the human mind, intended to announce righteousness to mankind, as his law."
"THE second inference which I make from the foregoing discourse, refpeds the intimate connecion, which those operations of corfcience have, with the peculiar. and diflinguifhing doarines of,'the Gospel of Christ. They will be found to accord with them so remarkably, as to furnilh an answer to some of those objetions, which superficial reafoners are ap -to raise against the Christian revela- SBaM.-"
"tion, In particular, they coincide with ._ that awful view which the Gospel gives us, of the future consequences of guilt."
"If the finner is now constrained by conscience, to view the Almighty as pursuing him with evil for long-forgotten crimes, how naturally must he conclude, that, in subsequent period of existence, the Divine administration will proceed ilpon the fame plan, and complete what hha been left imperfect here ? If, during this life, which is dnly the time of trial, the displeasure of Providence at fin is displayed by tokens so manifest, what may be apprehended to follow, when justice, which at present only begins to be executed, shall be carried to its consummation What conscience forebodes, revelation verifies; affuiring us, that a day is appointed, when God will render to every man according to his works; to them, who by patient continuance in welldoing, feekfor glory, honour, and immortality ; eternal lfe: But- unto them that'are SER I contentious, and obey not fh truth, bulýoble 11 unrighteoufnefi; indignation and- wra4h, "
"tribulation and anguijh, upon every fpu 6f man that doth evil, of the Jew frf ta4 also of the Gentile. For there is nq rfpfi of perons with God. For as Viany as hbqf , inned without the law, Jhall alIo perih - without the laei; and as many ps have finned in the law, jhall be judged by law *."
"While the threatenings of confcincc thus strengthen the evidence of the feri ture do&rine concerning future puqlihments, they likewise pave the way for the belief of what is revealed concerning the method of our deliverance by Christ."
"They suggest to the finner, fote deepl and dark malignity contained in guilt, which has drawn upon his head such high displeasure from Heaven. The
call forth his most anxious efforts, to avert the effeLs of that displeasure, ana to propitiate his offended judge. gom |

IHence mankind have constantly fled for refuge td such fubflitutions, as they could ife t6 placl in the room of the offenderi and, as by general consent, vitims have every here been Aain, and expiatory fa-'
renices have been offered up' on innumerable altars. 'Wherewith Jhall I come be fore the Lord, and bow myfIf before the mnof high God? Shall I come before him wiith burnt offerings, and calves of a year old?
Witl the Lord be pleased with thousand; of rams, or with ten thousand of rivers of oil?
10r, fJal[ give my fir-born for my tranfgreffon; the fruit of my body, for the jin of my foul*? There perplexities and agitations of a guilty conscience, may bj termed preludes, in some measure, to thq Gospel of Christ. They are the pointingg of unenlightened Nature, towards thai method of relief, which the grace Po God haa provided, Nature felt its inabi * Micah  6, 7-. I ERM. lity to extficate itself fromt the confe.
 quences of guilt: The Gospel reveals the plan of Divine interposition and aid.

Nature confeffed some atonement to be necessary: The Gospel discovers, that the necessary atonement is made. The remedy is no sooner presented, than i4 suitableness to the disease appears; and the great myflery of redemption, though it reaches, in its full extent, beyond our comprehension, yet, as far as it is revealed, holds a visible congruity with the sentiments of Conscience, and of Na 
Natural and revealed religion proceed from the fame Author; and, of course, are analogous and confiften. They are parts of the fame plan of Providence, They are conne&ted measures of the fame system of government. The serious belief of the one, is the best preparation for the reception of the other. Both concur in impressing our mind with a deep sense of one most important truth, 

which is the result of this whole 
course, That as we sow now, we mufl .XIII reap; that dnder the government of God, no one shall be permitted, with impunity, to gratify his criminal pas-,
fions, and to make light of the great duties of life.

# SERMON XIV. On the Mixture of Joy and Fear in Religion.

## PSAL.   Rejoice with trembling.



On ghe Mixture of Jo and FE , 4ti Rejoice with trembling.TO and Fear, are two great fpringi XIV. of human aaion. he mixed condition of this world, gives scope for both; and, according as the one or the other predominates, it influences the ge-.
neral tenour of our condua. Each of them poffeffes a proper place in religion.
To serve the Lord with gladness, is the exhortation of the Psalmist David*. To serve him with reverence and godly feaA, is the admonition of the Apostle Paul 
But, under the present, imperfetioti of SPfal.  2. $ Heb. xii. z8.

human nature, each of these principles may be carried to a dangerous extreme.
When the whole of religion is placed in joy, it is in hazard of rising into unwarxantable rapture. When it rests altogether on fear, it degenerates into fuperftitious servility. The Text enjoins a due mixture of both; and inculcates this important maxim, That joy, tempered with fear, is the proper disposition of a good man. In discoursing of this fubjet, I Thall endeavour to show, first, That joy is effentiaK to religipn; and next, That, for various reasons, this joy ought to be mixed with fear; whence we hiall be able t9 ascertain the nature of that steady and composed spirit, which is most suit, able to our present condition, and most acceptable to God.

I. Joy is essential to religion, in two refpeQsj; as religion inspires joy, and as it ;rquire§ it. In other words; To rejoice, iq both the privilege, and the duty, of good men.

IN the first place, Religion inspires joy.

XIV It affords just ground of gladness, to all who firmly believe its doarines, and fmn-cerely study to obey its laws: For it conw fers on them, the two most material re.
quifites of joy; a favourable situation of things without, and a proper ifpofitioi of mind within, to relish that favourable situation. '

When they examine their fituatiott without, they behold themselves placed in a' world, which is full of the iafluence of a gracious Providence; where beauty and good are every where predo, minant; where various comforts are beitowed; and where, if any be with-held, they have reason to believe, that theyare with-held by parental wisdom.. Among the crowd that encompass them, they may be at a loss to discern, who are their friends, and who their enemies.
But it is fufficients to know, that they are under the protection of. an invisible Guardian, whose power tan keep them from every evil. All the flops of his conduct, they may be unable to trace. 


Events may befall them, of which they can give no account. But as long as they are satisfied, that the system of Divine government is founded on mercy, rid present occurrences are able to defiroy their peace. For he who spared not his 6tin Son, but delivered him up for them, how Jhall he not with him freely give them all things? If their nature is frail, Divine affiflance is promised to strengthen it. If their virtue is imperfet, a difpenfation is opened, which gives them the hope of pardon. If their external circumftances be in any refpea unfavourable, it is because a higher interest is consulted. All things, they are assured, Jhall wbork together for their good. On their prosperity rests, the blessing; on their adversity, the fanaifying Spirit, of the Almighty. Old age may advance, and life decay; but beyond those boundaries of Nature, faith opens the profpe& of their lasting felicity. Without anxiety, they pass through the different periods of their present existence, becauf=
~ they know it to be no- more than an inotr plu&ion to immortality, * As such a situation of thintgs without lays a solid foundation for joy; tb the disposition which religion forms withiti promotes the relish of it. It is indeed from within, that the chief source .of enjoyment or trouble rife. The' tninds of bad men are always disorderly; hnd hence their lives are so generally uneasy.
In vain they take the timbrel and the harp, and endeavour to rejoice at the found afthe organ. Spleen and disgust pursue them, through all the haunts of amusement, Pride and ill humour torment- them.
Oppressed with discontent, their spirits flag; and their worn-out pleasures afford them entertainment no more. But religion subdues- those malignant passions, which are the troublers of human. repose i which either overcast the mind with the gloom of peevishness, or disquiet 'it-by the violence of agitation. It irifutes Ita -their roome those mild and gentle difpo.


fitiohs, whose natural effect is to smooth ER .
the tehour of the fouL Benevolence and candour, moderation and temperance, ,wherever they reign, produce cheerfulpefs and serenity. The confcioufuefs of integrity, gives ease and freedom to the Inied, Jt enables good men to extra&
from every objet, the whole fatisfadion which it is capable of yielding; and adds the flavour of innocence, to all their. external pleasures.

IN the -second place, As religion natu rally inspires joy; so, what it inspires, it commands us to cheriih. As a necessary proof of our sincerity, it requires cheer*
fulness in the performance of our duty ,because, if this be wanting, our religion discovers itself, not to be genuine in priaSiplei and in practice it cannot be fiable.

Religious obedience, destitute of joy, is mnot genuine in its principle. For, did either faith or hope, the love of God, or the love of goodness, rule the heart; they could not fail to produce fatisfadion   In piety and virtues I Allr those caufet _.., joy which I have dientioned, would, theb operate; and their native- effe& loti the mind, would follow. The profpeb which religion opens,'; would gladden, and the affetior whieh it inspires, would fobth the hearte. We serve, with pleasure, the benefactor' whoi ''ie love.
We rejoice in every fludy and purfui4, 'to which we are sincerely attached. If we serve not God with pleasure, i! is because we know him not, or lovq hii not. If we rejoice not in virtue, it is because our affeaior is alienated froih it, and our 'inclinations are depraved. 
give too evident proof, that either ,we believe not the principles of rHlgion, 'or that we feel 'hot theit power. ,Ettdude joy from religion; and you leave no>
other motives to it, except compulsion and interefbt But are these suitable grounds, on which to reft the whole'of our' obedience to the -Supreme Being .My son, give me thy heart' is the call of God. 'Surely if there be no pleasure in fulfilling hi I c6thnimndE, the heart is sot -given hiFMs athd, ith that cafe, the multi- .
fuderTof 3farifce., aHi burnt oferings, is brtought to his altar( in vain.

As religion, destitute bs joy, is imperfet in its prinaiple 1 fc, in praaice, it muft-be instable. In vain you endeavour to fix any -man to the regular performance of that, in whitch hd finds no pleasure. Bind him eVer so fast by interlft or fear, he will contrive some method of eluding the obligation.
Ingenuity is never so fertile of evasions, as *where pleasure is all on the one  and mere precept on the other. He may fludy to save appearances. He may dissemble Sand confirain hipTfelf. But his heart reVolts in secret; and the weight of inclination will, in the end, draw the practice * after it. If perfeveran is not to be expeded, fill tess can zeal be looked for, .from him, who, in his religious duties, trembles without rejoicing. Every attempt towards virtue -which he forms, will be feeble and awkward. He applies to it as a talk; he dreads the task-master; but Ee 2 Je he will labour no more than necetfy enjoins, To escape from punifhmept, his sole aim. He bargains for immunity, by ,every duty which he performs; and all beyond, he esteems superfluous toil.
-Such religion as this, can neither purify the heart, nor puepare for heavenly bliss. It is the refuge of an abje6t mind.
It may form the ritual of the monk, or prescribe the penance of the idolater; but has no concern with the homage of him, who 'worJhips the Father inspirit and in truth. His character is, that the jo es the Lord is his Jfrength *. It attaches his heart to religion. It inspires his zeal. It -supports his conflancy; and accelerates -his progress.

There is no man, but has some obje&

to which he cleaves for enjoyment; someiwhat that flatters him with distant hopi, or affords him present pleasure. Joy is the end towards wh)ch all rational beings tend. For the fake of it,: they live; it resembles the air they breath, which is necessary for the motion of the heart, 
Ind all the vital functions. But as the 4 breathing of infeaed air proves fatal to site; in the fame manner, joy drawn from a corrupted source, is deftruaive, both of virtue, and of true happiness, When you have no pleasure in goodftefs, you may with certainty conclude the reason to be, that your pleasure is all derived from an opposite quarter.
You have exhausted your affeaion upon the world. You have drunk too much of its poisoned waters, to have any relish for a. pure spring.
' Estimate, therefore, the genuineness of your religious principles; estimate the degree of your liability in religious practice, by the degree of your fatisfaaion in piety and virtue. Be allured, that where your treasure is, there will your delight be allo. The worldly man rejoices in his pofleffions; the voluptuous, in his pleafires; the, social, in his friends and companions. The truly good man rejoices in doing jufily, loving mercy, and walking 8 A  humly fuith the Lord his Cod. Hb haps i-..i py, when employed in the reghlat difr Charge of the great duties of life, poti taneous they flow from the affe&i6ris oefd pure heart. Not only from the keepieg'

Whom have I in heaven but thee? And-therd it none upon earth that I desire beides thee.
They did not receive the Jpirit of bondage but the sprit of adoption. They were filed *with peace and joy in believing. They re joiced in hope of the glory of God. As s6oo as the /Ethiopian eunuch received frotI Philip the light of the Gospel, that light revived and cheeredJhis heart. A new furn seemed to arise a new glory, to (hina around him. - Every objet brightened ;' 
and ha -went. on his way rejoicing *. After the fame manner should every good man, proceed in his journey through life, wit4, a, serene and cheerful spirit. Confl~rna-,
tioq and deje&ion let him leave to the slaves of guilt, who have every thing to dread, both from this world and the next. If he appear before others with adispirited afpea, he dishonours religion; and affords ground for suspicion, that he is either ignorant of its nature, or a firanger to its power.

Thus I have shown joy to be essential to religion. It is the spirit which it inSpires, and which it requires, in good men. But in our present slate, the best principles may be carried to a dangerous excess; and joy, like other things, has its due limits.. To serve God with unmixed delight, belongs to more advanced spirits in a happier world. In this region of imperfeaion, some infusions from a different cup, must of necessity tinaure our joy, Let ua then, 


 RRM.  TURN to the other of the argtr - --. -ment, and confider the reasons which ren, 
der it proper, that when -we rejoice, liould rejoice with trembling.

In the first place, because all the ob jeas of religipn, which afford ground for joy, tend to inspire, at the fame time, ix-verence and fear. We serve a Benefator, it is true, in whom we have reason to delight; whole purposes are gracious ; whose Jaw is the plan of our happiness. But this Benefacor, is the King eternal, immortil, and inv/fible; at whose presence, the hiourr.
tains shake, and Nature trembles. EVery good, and every perfel gift, come down from him. But the hand which confers them, -we cannot fee. Mysterious obscurity rests upon his essence. He dwelleth in thefecrtt place of thunder and clouds and darknkfs surround him. He is the Hearer ofprayer; but we lift our voice to him from afar.
Into his immediate presence no dcces' is permitted. Our warmest devotion admits no familiarity with him. God is in hewtu, qnd though up on earth ; therefore, let fby Jrordr be^fe ' If his omniscience admi- 
nifterf comfort in our secret distress, it -Jikewife fills with awe the heart that is conscious of guilt. For, if he knots our frame and remembers are durj; our ini ittiea, alfd, are ever before him our secret fins, in the light of his countenance.

Tfhroughout all his difpenfations, great sefs, in conjun6ion with goodness, strikes our view; and, wherever we behold the Parent, we behold the Legislator also. The death of Christ, in behalf of a guilty -world, is the chief ground of religious hope and joy. But it is no less the ground of reverepce; when, in this high tranfa.ion, weý-contemplate God, as at once firi6 in justice, and great in mercy. I the Lord keep mercy for thousands of them that fear me. Iforgive their iniquity, tranfgrejion, and fin; but I will by no means clear the guilty. When we open the book of the Law, we find promises and threatenings mingled in the fame page. On the ,bne  we fee Heaven displayed in all its glory: On the other, Hell opening 9 41, its terrours.- In short6 in whatever lighk we view religion, it appears folem~a a~4 venerable. It is a temple full of majetyL tp which the worshippers may 4pproachl wi comfort, irn the hope of optaixing.
grace, cMd fnding mercy; but where tley cannot enter, without being impreffe4 with awe. If we may be permitted to compare spiritual with natural .hings, religion resembles not those scenes of(
natural beauty, where every objea smiles, It cannot be likened to the gay landscape,,
or the flowery field. It resembles more the august and sublime appearances of Nature; the lofty mountain, the expanded ocean, and the tarry firmament; at the fight of which, the mind is- at once overawed and delighted; and, from the union of grandeur with beauty, derives a pleasing, but a serious, emotion.

IN the second place, As joy, tempered by fear, suits the nature of religion, so it is requisite for the proper regulation od the condu6t of man. Let his joy flow from the best and purest source; yet, if it 


remain long unmixed, it is apt to become dangerous to virtue. As waters which are never stirred, nor troubled, gather a sediment, which putrifies them; so the undisturbed continuance of placid sensations engenders disorders in the human foul. It is wifely ordered in our present slate, that joy and fear, hope and grief, should a6 alternately, as checks and balances upon each other, in order to prevent an excess in any of them, which our nature could not bear. If we were fubje6 to no alarms of danger, the wisest would soon become improvident; and the mQft humble, presumptuous.
Man is, a pilgrim on earth. Were his path to be always smooth and flowery, he would be tempted to relinquish his guide, and to forget the purpose of his journey. Caution and fear are the fthelds of happiness. Unguarded joy begets indolence; indolence produces fecurity; security leads to rashness; and rashness ends in ruin, In order to re $ ER  joice long, it is necessary that wS rejpice MXIV. with trembling. Had our first parents pbferved this rule, man might have been fill in paradise. He who faith in hip hearý, My mountain flandý Jtrong I hall never be moved; may be assured, that his slate already begins to totter. Religiq1q therefore, performs a kind qffice, iq giv, us the admonition of the Text. It inspires cheerfulness in the service of God. It proposes joy, as our chief spring of afion. But it supports joy, by guarding it with fear; not suppressing, but regulating its indulgence; requiring us to rejoice, like persons who have obtainea a treasure, which, through want of vigtlance, they are exposed to lose. Dependent beings are formed for fubmii-"
"'sion; and to submit, is to stand in awe."
"Because the Lord reigneth, let the earth be glad. We are the fubjeas of God; and therefore may juffly rejoice. But fill we are fubjeds; and,' therefore, trembling muff mix itself with our joy."
"I I the third place, The unstable condi- ERs XIV."
"tion of all human things, naturally inspires fear in the midst of joy. The spirit to which religion forms us, must undoubtedly correspond to the slate in :which we are placed, and to the part 'which is assigned us to a&. Now, the first view under which our present slate appears, is that of fallen creatures, who are undergoing, in this world, probation ýnd trial for their recovery; and are commanded to work out their salvation *withfedr and trembling. This view of our condition infers not habitual deje&ion of mind. It requires not melancholy abftradion from the affairs, or total contempt of the amusements, of life, But it inspires humility. It enforces dppendance on Divine aid; and calls forth the voice of supplication to Heaven. In a situation to critical, and where interests so important are at stake, every reasonable person must confess, that seriousness ought to temper rejoicing.- Weere there in human life any fixed -.- point of flability and reft, httainable by man; could we, at any one moment, tf.."
"'sure ourselves, that there remained ti6 latent source of danger, either to our temiporall or our spiritual state; then, I ad4 mit, we might lay trembling aide, anl rejoice in full security. 1ýBut; alas! no such safe station, no futh moment ps tonfidence, is allowed to mnan during liit warfare on earth. VicilHitudes of good and evil, of trials and cbnfolations, fill up his life. The best intentioned are sometimes betrayed into crimes; the most prudent, Overwhelmed with misfortines."
"The world *is like a -wheel incessantly "
"Volving, on which human things tlterL nately rife and fall. What is past of our life, has been a chequered scene. On its remaining periods, uncertainty and darkness reft. Futurity is an unknown atgion, into which no man tan look forward without awe, because he cannot'tell what forms of danger or trial tiay meet him there. This we know well, that, in tvery period ds our life, the path of hap- Sg rM -pinef'fhall be found steep and arduous; XIV."
"but swift and easy, the defcdnt to ruinm What,' with much exertion of care and ,igilance, we had built up, moe unwary a'ion may, in an evil hour, 'overthrow."
"The props of human donfidence are, irt rgeneral, insecure. The sphere of human .pleasures is narrow. i While we form ifchenmes for ftrengtheninge the one, and for enlargirg the other, death, mean- bhilei advances. Life, ewith a 4wiif, "
"though insensible course, glides awray; ,and, like a river hich andermines its banks, gradually impairs our slate. Year -after year fleals something from 'us; till the decaying fabric totter bs itself, and -crumble at length into duff. So that, -wfiether we confider life or death, time or eternity, all things appear to concur it giving to man the admonition of the Text, Rejoice with trembAni."
"SI HAVE niow thowni in what refpedas religion both promotes joy, and inspires 3 fcrioufnefs."
"S ERM. feriopfnefs. It places us in the most fa .vourable situation, whichq haman life if fords, for joy and it gives us every af-
fiftance, for relishing that joy. 'It renders it our duty, to cultivate the ftisfa6tion which it yields. It demaridq a cheerful spirit, in order to *ascertain the sincerity of our principles, aad to confirm us in good 'pracice. 'At. the fame' time, the jo5 which it inspires, is tempered with fear, by the genius of religion itself; by the dangers to which unguarded joy would expose us and by the impropriety 'of indulging it, in'a situation so mixed as the present. The trembling which is here -enjoined, is not to be understood as fignifying a pusillanimous dejeaion. It imports no more than that caution and to . briety, which prudence diaates, as 'be longing to our slate.- By conneeting such trembling with our joy, religion means to recommend to us, a' cheerful, but a composed, spirit, equally remote from the -humiliating depression of fear, andSthe xexlting levity of joy, Always, to re 
joice, is to be a fool. Always tQ tremble, 
is to be A slave. It is a modest cheerful- xlv.'
pefs, a chastened joy, a manly seriousness, which becomes the servant of God.

BUT is this, it may perhaps be said, 
the whole amount of that boasted fatiffation which religion beftows? Is this all the compensation which it makes, soS -those sacrifices it exacs ? Are not the terms which vice holds out, far more enticing, when it permits us to gratify every desire; and, in return for our furmounting the timorous scruples of conscience, promises us a life of gaiety, feftivity, and unrefraiaed joy ?----Such.
promises, vice may indeed make; but, how far it fulfils thems we may safely refer to the determination of the greatest sensualist, when he has finifled his career, and looks back on what he has en-*
joyed. Ask him, Whether he would recommend to his children, and his friends, . to hold the fame course; and whether, with his dying breath, he dare afflre them,. that the gratifications of lieritl.,- - oufnefs afford the greatest enjoyrnent of life'?. Whatever hopes vice mayat the beginnihg inspire, yet, after the trial Is made, it has been always found, tlat ,criminal pleafures' ate the' bane of happihenefs; the poison, not the cordial, of 'or 'pr6fent tate. They are pleasures, com-penfated riby 'an infinite overbalance pain.; Imoments of delight, succeeded bt years of, regret; purchased at the expece of injureed reputatioln, broken health, ano ruined peace. Even abstracting 'ronT their pernicious consequences, they are)
for most part, in themselves treacherous pleasures; urifound and diflurbed in the moments of enjoyment. In the midji offuch 'laughter, the heart isforrowful. 'Often is the smile of gaiety assumed, while the heart akes 'within: And though folly may taugIi, guilt will fling. Correcting this pernicious phrenzy of pleasure, and reducing it to a more sober and regulated slate, religioh is, in truth, no other than wisdom, introducing peace and order into the life of man."
"While religion condemns such plea- "
"Cures as are immoral, it is chargeable with no improper auflerity, in refpeat of those which are of an innocent kindT Think. not, that by the cautious difcipline which it prescribes, it excludes you from all gay enjoyment of life. Within the compass of that sedate spirit, to which it forms you, all that is innocently plea will be found to lie. It is a mistake to imagine, that, in constant esfusions of giddy mirth, or in that flutter of spirits which is excited by a round of diversions, the chief enjoyment of our slate consists. Were this the cafe, the vain and the frivolous would be on better terms for happiness, than the wife, the great, and the good. To arrange the plans of amusement, or to preside in the haunts of jollity, would be more defirable, than to exert the highest effort of mental powers for the benefit of na."
"tions. A consequence so absurd, is fufficient to explode the principle from which It flows. To the amusements and lesser  joys of the world, religion assigns their . proper place. It admits of them, ag iel laxations from care, as infiruments uof promoting the union of men, and of 61 livening their social intercourse. But though, as long as they are kept ithfitf due bounds, it does not censure nor cjndemn them; neither does it propose them, as rewards to the virtuous, or as the hflneipal objeas of their pursuit. To fitch, it points out nobler ends of a6ion. Thei felicity it engages them to seek, ini discharge of an useful, an upright, an&"
"honourable part in life; and, as the ha4 bitual tenour of their mind, it promotes cheerfulness, and discourages levity."

Passions, which had not been thoroughly subdued, struggle for their accustomed gratification. The pleasure which he expeAed to find in devotion, sometimes fails him; and the injustice of the world often fours and frets him. Friends prove ungrateful; enemies misrepresent, rivals supplant him; And part, at least, of the mortifications which he fuffers, he begins to ascribe to Virtue.-- Is this all the reward of my serving God, and renouncing the pleasures of fin ? Verily, in vain I have cleanjed my heart, and waJhed my hands in innocency. Behold, the ungodly prosper in the world, and have more than heart can wi/ ; while, all the day long, Jam plagued and chafned every morning.- -
To fueh persons as there, and to all who arp in hazard of being infeted with the*i fa  spirit, I now address myself. In reply to their complaints, I purpose to show, That in no slate they can choose on earth, ly no plan of condua they can form, it is possible for them to escape uneasiness and disappointment; that in a life of virtue, they will fuffer less uneasiness, and fewer disappointments, than in a course of vice;.
they will possess much higher resources and advantages; and they will. assured of cqmplete reward at the end. From these considerations, I hope to make it appear, that there is no fufficient reason.
for our being weary in well-doing; and that, taking human life upon the whole, Virtue is far the most eligible portion of I. UNEASINESS and disappointment are inseparable, in some degree, from every slate on earth, Were it in the power of the world, to render those who attach themselves to it, satisfied and lappy, you mnight then, I admit, have some title 
complain, if you found yourselves placed upon worse terms in the service of God. SE  But this is so far from being the cafe, _ that among the multitudes who devote'
themselves to earthly pleasure, you will'
not find a single person who has completely attained his aim. Enquire into the condition of the high and the low, of the gay and the serious, of the men of business and the men of. pleasure, and you thall behold them all occupied, in supplying some want, or in removing some diffrefs. No man is' pleased with'
being precisely what he is. Every-where.
there is a void; generally, even in the most prosperous life, there is some corner poffeffed by sorrow. He who is engaged in business, pines for leisure. He who enjoys leisure, languishes for want of employment. In a single, state, we envy the comforts of a family. In conjugal life, we are chagrined with domestic cares. In a safe flation, we regret the want of objetas for enterprise. In an enterprising life, we lament the want of f4fety. It is the doom of man, that his SER i  fly should never be free from all clouds, ^ 3 He is, at present, in an exiled and falUer slate. The. objeCs which surround, hwbin are beneath his native dignity. God.asa tinged them all with vanity, o4 purpofr to make him feel, that this is not hit reft that here he is not in his propetr place, nor arrived at his true home. I If, thlerefore, you aim at.'a condition'

'which. hall be exempted from every dii quiet, you pursue a phantom; yon increase the vanity and vexation of life,, by engaging in a chace so fruitless. If' yoti complain of virtue, because there is ina cident to it a portion of that uneafinefi which is found in every other state, yotie complaint is most unreasonable. You claim an immunity from evil, which belongs not to the lot of man. Recon-.
cile yourselves, then, to your condition i and, instead of looking for perfet 'hap-.

  THOUGH no condition of human life is, free from uneafdnefs, I contend, 
Thattlhe uneasiness belonging, to a sinful course, is far greater, than what attends a tdurfe of well-doing. If you be 'weary of the labdurs of virtue, be assured, that the world, whenever you try the ex*
change, will lay upon you a much heavier load. It is the outside, only, of a licentious life, which is gay and smiling.
Within, it conceals toil, and trouble, and deadly sorrow. For vice poisons human happiness in the spring, by introducing difbrdec into the heart. Those passions which it seems to indulge, it only feeds with, imperfec gratifications; and there.
by strengthens them for preying, in the endi on their unhappy victims'

It is a great mistake to imagine, that the pain of felf-denial is edhfined to virtue.
He who folltows the world, as much as he Whc follows Christ, must take up Kir icrqs and to- him, assuredly, it will prove a ore oppressive burden. Vice allows all our pallions to range uncon

No tnortifications' which 'virtue 'eexaas, ar4 mre 'fevere than thdfe, which ambitioa imposes upon the love of ease, pride upqn iatereft, and covetousness ! upon vanity, Selfi-dpial, therefore, -belongs, in come; moi, to. vice--and virtue; but with this remarkable difference, that the passions which virtue requires us -to mortify, it tends to weakren; whereas, 'thofe which vice obliges us to dehy',: it, at the fame time, strengthens. The one diminiihes the pain of felf-denial, by moderating the idemand of passion; the other increases it, . by' rendering those demands imperious and. violent.-What diffreffes, hbat oqcur in the Calm life of virtue, caa he compared tothofe tortures, which .re, ajorfe of conscience inflias on the wicked; to those -severe humiliations, arising from gilt cpmbined ,with misfortunes, which iak -.thiem to the dust; to those, iolgt agitations of shame and disappointment, which sometimes drive them to the mofR   .fatal extremities, and make them abhor their existence ? How,often, in the midst of thofl disastrous situations, into which their crimes have brought them, have they cursed the fedutions of vice; and, with bitter regret, looked back to the day on which they first forsook the path of innocence !

But; perhaps, you imagiqi, that to foch miseries as these, great, criminals only are exposed; and that,'by a wary and cautious management, it is possible to avoid them. Take vice and virtue, then, i& the -most general point of view.
Compare God and the world as two maf*
tet-, the one or other of whom you must obey; and cdnfider fairlyp in whose ferL vice there will be reafon for your being weary soonest, and .repenting moif frequently. The world is both a hard, and a capricious master. To fubmii to a long servitude, in the view of a recompense from which they are excluded in the end, "
"3 is known to be often the fate of those ,--- fwho are devoted to the world. They sacrifice their present ease, to their future profpedts. They court the great, and flatter the multitude. They prostitute their conscience, and difhofnour their charaater : And, aftet all their efforts, how uncertain is their fuceefs Competitors justle, and outstrip them. The more artful deceive, the more violent overthrow them. Fair profpefts orrce fmiiled; but clouds fooft gather; the sky is darkened; the scene changes; and that fickle world, whkch, a morent before, had flattered, the next momeiat, forgets them, "
"God is never mistaken in the charader of his servants ; for hefeeth their hearts, and jzdgeth aecording to the truth, But the world is often deceived in those who court its favour;. and, of course, is un*"
"just in the distribution of its rewards."
"Flattery gains the ear of power. Fraud supplants innocence and the pretending, and assuming, occupy the place of the worthy and the modest. In vain yot Flaim any inerit withl the world, on ac- ER "
"count of your good intentions. The - -"
"world knows them not; regards them .not. It judges of you, solely by yout acions; and, what is worse, by the suecess of your aaions, which often depends ,not on yourselves.

"The well-meant endeavours of the poor, find the fame acceptance with him, as the generous acions of the rich. The widow mite, is, in his eye, a costly offering; and even he who giveth to a difciple 4 cup of cold water, when he can give him no more, goeth not without his -reward."
"As the world is unjust in its judgments, "
"'so it is ungrateful in its requitals. Time speedily effaces the memory of the greateft services; and when we can repeat them no more, we are negleaed, and thrown aside.

"' he would not have cast me off in ny Al iold age. Unfaithfulnefs, and ingratitude, are unknown to God.

"How unjust are they, who become weary so much sooner in the service of God, than they do in that of the most severe and imperious of all maflers '"
"III. THE resources of virtue are mucl greater than those of the world; the compenfations which it makes for our diftrefles, far more valuable. Perpetual success belongs neither to the one, nor the other."
"But under disappointments, when they occur, virtue bears us up; the world allows us to fink. When the mind of a good man is hurt by misfortunes, religion adminiffers the cordial, and infuses the balm. Whereas the world inflids wounds, and then leaves them to fester."
"It brings sorrows, but it provides no confolation. Consolation is entirely the province of religion. Supposing religion to be inferiour to vice in external advantages, it must be allowed to possess internal peace, in a much higher degree. This is so certain, that almost all men, at some period or other of their life, look forward to it, as to a desirable retreat. When the ends of their present pursuit shall be accomplished, they propose to themselves much fatisfaaion, in an honourable difcharge of the duties of their flation, amidst those moderate passions, and temperate pleasures, which innocence allows."
"That which all men agree in holding to be second in importance to the pursuit which they folow, may be safely esteemed to be the first in real worth; and it - may be concluded, that if they were not blinded by forne prevailing passion, they would discern and adopt it as such."
"It is the peculiar effet of virtue, tp make a man chief happiness arise from himself and his own conduc. A bad man is wholly the creature of the world."
"He hangs upon its favour, lives by its smiles, and is happy or miserable, in proportion to his success. But to a virtuous man, success in worldly undertakings is but a secondary objea. To diicharge his own part with integrity and honourý is his chief aim. If he has done properly what was incumbent on him to do, his mind is at reft; to Providence he leaves the event. His witness is in heaven, and his record is on high. Satisfied with the approbation of God, and the testimony of a good conscience, he enjoys himself, .and despises the triumphs of guilt. In proportion as such manly principles rule your heart, you will become independent of the world; and will forbear complain of its difcouragements. It is the imperfeaion of your virtue, which occasions '--'"
"you to be weary in well-doing. It is because your hearts remain divided between God and the world, that you are so often discontented; partly wishing to discharge your duty, and partly seeking your happiness from somewhat that is repugnant to your duty. Study to be more consistent in principle, and more uniform in pratice, and your peace will be more unbroken."
"Though virtue may appear at first fight to contrat the bounds of enjoyment, you will find, upon reflecion, that, in truth, it enlarges them. If it restrains the excess of some pleasures, it favours and increases others. It precludes you from none, but such as are either fantaflick and imaginary, or pernicious and deftrucive."
"Whatever is truly valuable in human enjoyment, it allows to a good man, no less than to others. It not only allows him such pleasures, but heightens them, by that grateful relish which a good conscience gives to every pleasure. It nQt . only heightens them, but adds to them, "
"'-*A-' also, the peculiar fatisfadions which flow from virtuous sentiments, from devout affedions, and religious hopes. On how much worse terms is the finner placed, in the midst of his boasted gratifications?"
"His portion is confined to this w6rld."
"His good things are all of one fort only; She has neither knowledge, nor relish, of any thing beyond them. His enjoyment, therefore, refls on a much narrower basis, than that of the servants of God. Enlarge, as much as you please, the circle of worldly gratifications; yet, if nothing of the mind and the heart, nothing of a refined and moral nature, enter into that circle, and vary the enjoyment, languor and weariness soon succeed. Among whom do you hear more peevish expreffions of discontent, or more frequent complaints of low spirits, than among the prosessed votaries of worldly pleasure ?"
"Vice and virtue, in their progress, as in every other refpet, hold an opposite 'courfe. The beginnings of vice are en "
"ticing. The firft' feps of worldly  "
"Ivancement, are flattering and pleasing."
"But the continuance of fucceft blunts enjoyment, and flattens desire. Whereas the beginnings of virtue are laborious."
"'But, by perseverance, its labours diminiihb and its pleasures increase. As it ripeps into confirmed habit, it becomes both smoother in praaice, and more complete in its reward. In a worldly life, the termination of our hopes always meets our view. We fee a boundary before us, beyond which we cannot reach."
"But the profpeas of virtue are growing, and endless. The righteous Jhall hold on in his way; and he that hath clean hands, Jhall wax fronger and fronger. The path of the jizf is as the hining light, that Jhineth more and more unto the perfel7 day."
"This brings me to confider, "
"IV. THE assured hope, which good men enjoy, of a full reward at last. I hlave endeavoured, by several confiderations, to corret your impatience under  the. present difcouragements of virtue."
"XV, 6 -- I have shown many high advantages, "
"which it already poffeffes, But now, laying all these aside; supposing virtue to have brought you no advantage, but to have only engaged you in perpetual firuggles' with an evil world; the Text suggests what is fufficient to answer every objeCion, and to silence every complaint; In due season you fJJall reap, if you faint not. It is not a loose encouragement, or a dubious hope, which is held forth to us. A dire and explicit declaration is made by the Spirit of God, that piety and virtue, how discouraged soever, or oppressed, they may be for a while, shall not be frustrated of their reward'; but that in due season, when the period which is fixed by the Divine decree shall come, all who have not been weary in .well-doing, though they may havefown in tears,fhall reap injoy. As this great principle of faith is so essential to our present argument, and is indeed the foundation of all religion, will be proper that we aow take a view of the grounds on which it rests. By fixing our attention, both on the proofs which reason suggests, and on the discoveries which revelation has made, of a state of future retribution, we ihall take an effectual method of confirming our adherence to religion, and of baffling those temptations which might lead us to be weary in well-doing."
"T HE first, and most obvious prefump  which reason affords in behalf of future rewards to the righteous, arises from the imperfe& distribution of good and evil in our present state. Notwithtfanding what I have advanced concerning the pleasures and advantages of virtue, it cannot be denied, that the happiness of good men is often left incomplete."
"The vicious possess advantages, to which they have no right; while the confcientious fuffer for the fake of virtue, and groan under distresses which they have not merited from the world. Indeed, were the distribution of good and evil, in this life, altogether promiscuous; could --- it'be said, with truth, that thea moral condition of men had no influence whatever upon their happiness or misery I -admit, that from such a state of things, ano presumption would arise, of any future retribution being intended. . They who delight to aggravate the miseries of life, and the distresses of virtue, do no service to the argument in behalf of .
vidence. For, if total disorder be found to prevail now, suspicions may, too juftr ly, arise, of its prevailing for ever. If he who rules the universe, entirely ne, gleds virtue here, the probability must be small, of his rewarding it hereafter.
But this is far from being the true Rfate of the fa&. What human life presents to the view of an impartial observer, is by no means a scene of entire confusion; but a itate of order, begun, and carried on a certain length. Virtue is so far from being negleaed by the Governour of the world, that from many evident marks, it appears to be a chief objea of his care. In the conflitution of human nature, a foundation is laid, for comfort to the righteous, and for internal punishmeent to the wicked. Throughout the course of Divine government, tenden-ies towards the happiness of the one, and the misery of the other, conflantly appear. They are so conspicuous, as not to have escaped the notice of the rudest nations. -Over the whole earth, they have diffufed the belief, that Providence is propitious to virtue, and adverse to guilt. Yet these tendencies are, sometimes, disappointed of their effea; and that which Providence visibly favours, is left, at present% without an adequate re,ward.

From such an imperfea difiribution of happiness, what are we to conclude, but that this system is the beginning, not the whole of things; the opening only of a more extensive plan, whole confummation reaches into a future world ? If God has already et his throne for judgment; if he has visibly begun to reward and to . punish, in some degree, on earth, he canU-  not mean to leave the exercise of govern ment incomplete. Having laid the foundation of a great and noble ftruCiure, he will in due time rear it up to perfeaion.
The unfinished parts of the fabric evidently show, that a future building is intended. All his other works are conftruded according to the most full and exaa proportion. In the natural world, nothing is deficient, nothing redundant.
It is in the moral world, only, that we discover irregularity and defea. It falls short of that order and perfeaion, which appear in the reft of the creation. It exhibits not, in its present slate, the fame features of complete wisdom, justice, or goodness. But can we believe, that, under the government of the Supreme Being, those apparent disorders shall not be redified at the last ? Or, that from his conduct towards his rational creatures, the chief of his works, the sole objedcion against his perfecion ihall be allowed to rife, and ihall continue unremoved for ever.

On the supposition of future rewards xvM.

and 'punifhments, a satisfying account can b6 given, of all the disorders which at present take place on earth. Chriftianity explains their origin, and traces them to their iffle. Man, fallen from his primeval felicity, is now undergoing probation and discipline for his final date. Divine juflice remains, for a season, concealed; and allows men to at their parts with freedom on this theatre, that their charaaers may be formed and ascertained. Amidst difcouragements and afflitions, the righteous give proof of their fidelity, and acquire the habits of virtue. But, if you suppose the events of this life to have no reference to another, the whole slate of man becomes, not only inexplicable, but contradiatory, and inconsistent. The powers of the inferiour animals are perfedtly suited to their station. They know nothing higher than their present condition. In gratifying their appetites, they fulfill their deftityY-and pass away. Man, alone, comes SE  forth to at a part, which carries no  Smeaning, and tends to no end. Endowed with capacities, which extend far beyood his present Iphere; fitted by his ratioprn nature, for running the race of immorz tality, he is flopped short in the very en(
trance of his course. He squanders his activity on pursuits, which he discerns to be vain. He languishes for knowledge, which is placed beyond his reach. Hd thirts after a happiness, which heo is doomed never to enjoy. He fees, and laments, the disasters of his state; and yet, upon this supposition, can find nothing to remedy- them.-Has the eternal God any pleasure in sporting himself with such a scene of misery and folly, as this life, if it had no connetion with another, muff exhibit to his eye? Did he call into exiflence this magnificent uni*
verse, adorn it with so much beauty and splendour, and surround it with those glorious luminaries which we behold irn the heavens, only that some generations of mortal men might arise to behold these wonders, and then disappear for eve ti ME How unsuitable, in this cafe, were thd '
habitation to the wretched inhabitant!
How inconsistent the commencement of his -being, and the mighty preparation of his powers and faculties, with his defpieable end How contraditory, in fine, were every thing which concerns the slate of man, to, the wisdom and perfetion of hid Maker!

'Throughout all ages, and among all nations, the persuasion of a future life has prevailed. It sprung not from the refinements of science, or the speculations of philosophy; but from a deeper and stronger root, the natural sentiments of the human heart. Hence it is common to the philosopher and the savage; and is found in the most barbarous, as well as in the most civilized regions. Even the belief of the being of a God, is not more general on the earth, than the belief of immortality. Dark, indeed, and confitfed, were the notions which men entertained concerning a future state.

Yet itill, in ,that state, they looked for  retribution, both to the good, and the bad; and in the perfetion of such pleafures, as they knew best, and valued most highly, they placed the rewards of the virtuous. So universal a consent feems.plain*
ly to indicate, an original determination given to the foul by its Creator. It shows this great truth, to be native and congenial to man.

When we look into our own breasts, 
we find various anticipations and presages of future existence. Most of our great and high passions, extend beyond the limits of. this life. The ambitious and the felf-denied, the great, the good, and the wicked, all take interest, in what is to happen after they ihall have left the earth. That passion for fame, which inspires so much of the ativity of mankind, plainly is animated by the perfuasion, that consciousness is to survive the dissolution of the body. The virtuous are supported by the hope, the guilty tormented with the dread, of what is to alce place Atter death. As death Approaches, 


the hopes 6f the one, arid the fears of the other, are found to redouble. The foul$
when issuing henee feertms more clearly t6 diifern its future abode, All the operationd of eonfcietite, proceed upon the belief of inim ortality. The whole moral condua of ineh refers to it. All legislators have supposed it. All religions are built upon it.
It is so essential to the order of society, that were it erased, human laws would pro ineffe&ual' eftraints from evil, and a deluge of brimes arid miseries wpuid overflovt the earth. To suppose this universal and powerful belief to be without foundation in truth, iý to suppose, that a principle of delusion wA interwoven .ith the nature of man ; is .td suppose, that his Creator was teduced ;to ;the necessity of imprefling his heart with a falsehood, inr order to make him answer the ptrpofes of his being.

1UT though these arguments be firong,.

yet all argtments are liable to objedion.
Perhaps this general belief, of which I have spoken, has been owing to inclination and . desire, more than to evidence. Perhaps, in pur reasonings on this fubjet from the Divine perfedions, we flatter ourselves with being of more consequence, than we truly are, in the fyfiem of the universe. Hence the great importance of a discovery pr6ceeding from God himself, which gives full authority to all that reason had suggested, and places this capital truth beyond the'
reach of suspicion or distrust.

The method which Christianity has ta ken, to convey to us the evidence of a future slate, highly deserves our attention. Had the Gospel been addressed, like a system of philosophy, solely to the underflanding of men; had it aimed only at enlightening the fludious and refle  it would have confined itself to abftra& truth; it would have simply informed us, that the righteous are hereafter to be rewarded, and sinners to be punished. Such a declaration as that contained in the Text, would have been fufficient: Be not weary in well-doing; for in due season you hall reap, if you faint not. 


But the Gospel has not flopped, at barely announcing life and immortality to mankind. It was calculated for popular edification. It was intended to be the religion not merely of the few, whose underflanding was to be informed ; but of the many, also, whose imagination was to be impressed, and whose paflions were to be awakened, in order to give the truth its due influence over them. Upon this account it not only reveals the certainty of a future slate, but, in the person of the great Founder of our religion, exhibits a series of fads relating to it; by means of which, our senses, our imagination, and passions, all become interested in this great objet.

The refurreaion of Chrifi from the grave, 
was designed to be a sensible evidence, that death infers not a final extinction of the living principle. He rose, in order to show, that, in our name, he had conquered death, and was become the irftfruits of them that sleep. Nor did he only rife from the grave, but, by ascending to heaven in a visible form, before Tmany witnesses, gave an ocq 16-ý lar specimen of the transition from this world, into the region of the blessed. The employments which now occupy him there, are fully declared. As our fore-runner, he hath entered within the veil. He appears in the presence of God for us. ,He maketh perpetual interce/ion for bis people. I go, faith he,' to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God. In my Father house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself that where I am, there ye may be ao4o. The circumstances of his coming again, are diflindly foretold. The founding of the last trumpet, the refurreaion of the dead, the appearance of the Judge, and the solemnity with which he shall difcriminate the good from the bad, are all described.
The very words in which he shall pronounce the final sentence, are recited in our hearing: Come, ye blefed of my Father!
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Then shall the holy and the just be caught up in the tlouds, to meet the Lord in the air. They $  shall enter with him into the city of the   God. They shall possess the new earth and new heavens, wherein dwelleth righteoufnefs. God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes. They Jhall behold his face in righteousness, and be satisfied with hit likeness for ever.-By recording such a train of striking circumstances and fads, the Gof, pel familiarizes us in some measure with a future state. By accommodating this great discovery, in so useful a manner, to the conceptions of men, it furnishes a strong intrinsic evidence of its divine origin.

THUS, upon the whole, whether you consult your reason, or listen to the discoveries of revelation, you behold our argument confirmed; you behold a life of piety and virtue, issuing in immortal felicity, Of what worldly pursuit can it be pronounced, that its reward is certain? Look every where around you, and you shall fee, that the race is far from being always to the swift, or the battle to the fjrong. The  most diligent, the most wife, the most ao,   complifhed, may, after all their labouis, be disappointed in the end; and be left to susser the regret, of havingfpent their lrengtb for nought. But, for the righteous, is laid up the crown of life. Their final happiness is prepared in the eternal plan of Providence, and secured by the labours and susferings of the Saviour of the world.

Cease, then, from your unjust complaints against virtue and religion. Leave difcon, tent, and peevishness, to worldly men. In no period of distress, in no moment of difappointment, allow yourselves to fufpet, thaý piety and integrity are fruitless. In every slate of being, they lead to happiness.
If you enjoy not at present their full rewards, it is because the season of recompence is not yet come. For, in due season you fhallrepp.
There is a time which is proper for reward; and there is a period which belongs to trial.
How long the one should last, and when the other should arrive, belongs not to you tp determine. It is fixed by the wife, though unknown, decree of the Almighty.

But, be assured, that He that cometh, shall come, and will not tarry. He shall come in '
due season, to reRore perse& order among his works; to bring reft to the weary, comfort to the afflided, and just retribution to all men. Behold, faith the faithful and true Witness, I come quickly, and my reward is with me. To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midfl of the paradise of God. I will give him the morning far. I will make him a pillar in my temple. HeJhall be cloathed in white raiment; and shall it down with me, on my throne*.

"# SERMON I. On the TRUE HONOUR of MAN. PROVERBS,  8. Exalt her, and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee to honour. "
"On the TRUE HONOUR of MAN."
"PROVERBS,  8."
"Exalt her, and Jh Jall promote thee; /he fJall bring thee to bonour IHE love of honour is one of the "
"'strongest passions in the human ."
"heart. It ihows itself in our earliest years; and is coeval with the first exertions of reason. It accompanies us through all the itages of subsequent life; and in private stations discovers itself no less than in the higher ranks of society. In their ideas of what conflitutes honour, men Vo..

"SEn  greatly vary, and often grossly err. But I. of somewhat which they conceive to form pre-eminence and diltinclion, all are delirous. All with, by tome means or other, to acquire refipcl fiom those among whom they live; and to contempt andl liigracc, none are inlenfible."
"Among the advantages which attend religion and virtue, the honour which they confer on man is frequently mentioned in scripture as one of the moit considerable."
"71'fitom is the principal thing, lays Solomon in the passage where the text lies, therefore get wildom; and wibt all thy getting, get under/landing. Exalt her, and Jhc ball promote thee; jhe JIall bring thee to honour, when thou dofl embrace her. Sheb Jallgive to tl ne head an ornament of grace; a crown o5 glory Jhall/he deliver to thee. It is evident that throughout all the sacred writings, and particularly in this book of Proverbs, by fdon is to be underflood a principle of religion producing virtuous conduct. The fear of the Lord is said to be the beginning of wiridom: And by this fear of the Lord men men are aiid to dc  fr::' evil; to walk ' "
"i/ ihe iwa  good imen, and It ' the path 'of ribticoIs *. Man is  regulated by tlCh wIf.i/!: ic/'i/uJ is frcmi al'.ve, when hl is formed bh picty to the duties of virtue and morality; and of the wild!om which produces this elFect, it is afelrted in the text, that it brinrcrth us to bor.: "
"On this recommendation of religion it is the more neceflarv to fix our attention, because it is often refuft to it by men of the world. Their notions of honour are apt to run in a very different channel."
"Wherever religion is mentioned, they conn. with it ideas of melancholy and dejedion, or of mean and feeble spirits. They perhaps admit that it may be ufefull to the multitude, as a principle of reitraint from disorders and crimes; and that to persons of a peculiar turn of mind, it may afford consolation under the diltrecles of life. But from the acive scenes of the world, and from those vigorous exertions which difplay to advantage the human abilities, they Prov.  20."
" incline totally to exclude it. It may tooth a_, the timid, or the fad: But they confider it as having no connection with what is pro."
"per to raise men to honour and diftintion."
"I flall now endeavour to remove this reproach from religion; and to fiow that in every situation of human life, even in the highest stations, it forms the honour, as well as the happiness of man."
"But first, let us be careful to ascertain what true religion is. I admit that there is a certain species of religion (if we can give it that name) which has no claim to such high diftinicion; when it is placed wholly in speculation and belief, in the regularity of external homage, or in fiery zeal about contested opinions. From a fuperftition inherent in the human mind, the religion of the multitude has always been tinctured with too much of this spirit."
"They serve God as they would serve a proud master, who may be flattered by their prostrations, appeased by their gifts, and gained by loud protestations of attachment to his interests, and of enmity to all whom whom they suppose to be his foes. But this is not that wisdom to which Solomon '"
"ascribes, in the text, such high prerogatives. It is not the religion which we preach, nor the religion of Chrit. That religion consists in the love of God and the love of man, grounded on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Redeemer of the world, the Intercessor for the penitent, and the Patron of the virtuous; through whom we enjoy comfortable access to the Sovereign of the universe in the ads of worship and devotion. It consists in juftice, hutnanity, and mercy; in a fair and candid mild, a generous and affeCionate heart; accompanied with temperance, selfgovernment, and a perpetual regard in all our actions to conscience, and to the law of God. A religious, and a thoroughly virtuous characer, thercfore, I confider as the fame."
"BY the true honour of man is to be underftood, not what merely commands external refped, but what commands the reB 3 fpea  fpeca of the heart; what raises one to ac_ knowledged eminence above others of the %ltme fpecics; what always creates esteem, and in its highest degree, produces veneration. The queltion now before us is, from what caute this eminence arises ? By what means is it to be attained ?"
"I SAY, firfi, from riches it does not arise."
"These, we all know, may belong to the vilelt of mankind. Providence has fcattcrcd them among the crowd with an undiftinguilhing hand, as of purpote to show of what finall account they are in the fight of God. Experience every day proves that the possession of them is confiflent with the most general contempt. On this point therefore I conceive it not necessary to inlilt any longer."
"NEITHER does the honour of man arise from mere dignity of rank or office. Were uich dittincions alwa  or even generally, obtained in confc(luence of uncommon merit, they would indeed confer honour on tle characler. But, in the lpreient slate of ibciety, "
"On the True HoIlour of Mal. 7 society, it is too well known that this is not the ciall. They arc often the confe- ..."
"quence of birth alone. They are tometimes the fruit of mere dependence and afliduity. They may be the rccumpence of flattery, veriatility, and intrigue ; and so be conjoined with meanness and bafiness of character. To pcrfons graced with noble birth, or placed in high itations, much external honour is due. This is what the subordination of society neceilarily requires; and what every good member of it will chearfully yield. But how often has it happened that such persons, when externally respected, are, nevertheless, despised by men in their hearts; nay, sometimes execrated by the public ? Their elevation, if they have been unworthy of it, is so far from procuring them true honour, that it only renders their infignificance, perhaps their infamy, more confpicuous. By drawing attention to their conduct, it discovers in the most glaring light how little they deserved the itation which they poffcfs."
"B4 I  I MUST next observe, that the proper ho,_._ nour of man arises not from some of those lplendid actions and abilities which excite high admiration. Courage and prowess, military renown, frgnal vicories and conquefis, may render the name of a man famous, without rendering his character truly honourable. To many brave men, to many heroes renowned in dtory, we look up with wonder. Their exploits are recorded. Their praises are fiung. They fland as on an eminence above the reft of mankind. Their emirnence, nevertheless, may not be of that fort before which we bow with inward esteem and. refpeA. Something more is wanted for that purpose, than the conquering arm, ahnd the intrepid mind."
"The laurels of the warrior must at all times be dyed in blood, and bedewed' with the tears of the widow and the orphan. But if they have been stained by rapine and inhumanity; if fordid avarice has marked his charater; or low and gross sensuality has degraded his life; the great hero finks into a little man. What at a distance, or on a superficial superficial view, we admired, becomes mean, "
"perhaps odious, when we examine it more closely. It is like the Colossal statue, Whose; immense size struck the fpetator afar off with astonishment; but when nearly viewed, it appears disproportioned, unihapely, and rude."
"Observations of the fame kind may be applied to all the reputation derived from civil accomplishments; from the refined politics of the statesman; or the literary efforts of genius and erudition. These bestow, and, within certain bounds, ought to bestow, eminence and diftin&ion on men: They discover talents which in them."
"'selves are flining; and which become highly valuable, when employed in advancing the good of mankind. Hence, they frequently give rife to fame. But a diftinction is to be made between fame and true honour. The former.is a loud' and noisy applatfe: The latter, a more silent and internal homage. Fame floats on tie' breath of the multitude: Honour refts on the judgement of the thinking. Fame may give . give praise while it with-holds esteei:"
"True honour implies eftecm mingled with refped. The one regards particular diftinguifhed talents: the other looks up to the whole character. Hence the statesman, the orator, or the poet, may be famous; ile yet the man himself is far from being honoured. We envy his abilities. We with to rival them. But we would not chute to be clalfed with him who poifefled them."
"Instances of this fort arc too often found in every record of ancient or modern history."
"FROM all this it follows, that in order to discern where man true honour lies, we must look, not to any adventitious circumstance of fortune; not to any single sparkling quality; but to the whole of what forms a man; what intitles him, as such, to rank high among that class of beings to which he belongs; in a word, we must look to the mind and the foul.- A mind fuiperior to fear, to selfish interest and corruption; a mind governed by the principles of uniform reCtitude and integrity; the fame in prosperity prosperity and adversity; which no bribe "
"can seduce, nor terror overawe; neither by pleasure melted into effeminacy, nor by distress funk into dejection; such is the mind which forms the diflincion and eminence of man. One, who in no fituation of life is either ashamed or afraid of dilcharging his duty, and acting his proper part with firmnels and constancy; true to the God whom he worships, and true to the faith in which he professes to believe; full of affcction to his brethren of mankind; faithful to his friends, generous to his enemies, warm with compassion to the unfortunate; fclf-denying to little private interests and pleasures, but zealous for public interest and happiness; magnanimous, without being proud; humble, without being mean; jult, without being harsh; fimpie in his manners, but manly in his feelings; on whose word you can entirely rely; whose countenance never deceives you; whose profeifions of kindness are the effusions of his heart: one, in fine, whom independent of any views of advantage, you would *"
"ERM . Would chufe for a superior, could trust in as a friend, and could love as a brother:"
"- This is the man, whoil in your heart, above all others, you do, you must, hoflour."
"SucH a character, imperfc&ly as it has now been drawn, all must acknowledge to be formed solely by the influence of steady religion and virtue. It is the effect of principles which, operating on conscience, determine it uniformly to pursue wbatfoever things are true, wbatfoever things are bonfi, wbatfoever things are juJt, wbatfoever things are pure, whbafoever things are lovely, wbatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise *. By there means, wi/hom, as the text aflerts, bringetb us to bonour."
"IN confirmation of this doctrine it is to be observed, that the honour which man acquires by religion and virtue is more independent, and more complete, than what * Philip.  8."
"can Gan be acquired by any other means. It is sERM."
"independent of any thing foreign or exter- ._ na. It is not partial, but entire refpet, which it procures. Wherever fortune is concerned, it is the station or rank which commands our deference. Where some fhining quality attracts admiration, it is only to a part of the character that we pay homage. But when a person is diftinguiihed for eminent worth and goodness, it.is the man, the whole man, whom we refpe&"
"The honour which he pofeffes is intrinsic."
"Place him in any situation of life, even an obscure one; let room only be given for his virtues to come forth and lhow themselves, and you will revere him; as a private citizen; or as the father of a family."
"If in higher life he appear more illustrious, this is not owing merely to the refped created by rank. It is, because there a nobler sphere of action is opened to him; because his virtues are brought forth into more extended exertion; and placed in such confpicuous view, that he appears to grace and adorn the station which he fills. Even in  in the silence of retirement, or in the retreat of old age, filch a man finks not into forgotten obscurity. His remembered virtues continue to be honoured, when their active exertions arc over; and to the laif stage of life he is followed by public esteem ,and respect. Whereas, if genuine worth be wanting, the applause which may have attended a man for a while, by degrees dies away. Though, for a part of his life, he had dazzled the world, this was owing to his deficiency in the essential qualities having not been suspected. As soon as the imposture is discovered, the falling flar finks in darknefs.-There is therefore a flandard of independent, intrinsic worth, to which we must bring in the end whatever claims to be honourable among men."
"By this we muff measure it; and it will always be found, that nothing but what is essential to man has power to command the refpet of man heart."
"IT is to be farther observed, that the universal content of mankind in honouring real real virtue, is sufficient to show what the SERmu genuine sense of human nature is on this iubjed. All other claims of honour are ambulatory and changeable. The degrees of respect paid to external stations vary with forms of government, and faihions of the times. Qualities which in one country are highly honoured, in another are lightly esteemed. Nay, what in some regions of the earth distinguishes a man above others, might elsewhere expose him to contempt or ridicule. But where was ever the nation on the face of the globe, who did not honour unblemished worth, unaffeced piety, stedfast, humane, and regular virtue? To whom were altars ere in the Heathen world but to those who by their merits and heroic labours, by their invention of uffful arts, or by some signal ads of beneficence to their country, or to mankind, were found worthy, in their opinion, to be tranfferred from among men, and added to the number of the gods ? Even the counterfeited appearances of virtue, which are so often found in the world, are teflimo."
"nies AERM. nies to its praise. The hypocrite knows  that, without aftuning the garb of virtue, "
"every other advantage he can possess is insufficient to procure him esteem. Interference of intercft, or perversity of difpofi."
"tion, may occasionally lead individuals to oppose, even to hate, the upright and the good. But however the charadters of such persons may be mistaken, or misrepresented, yet, as far as they are acknowledged to be virtuous, the profligate dare not traduce them. Genuine virtue has a language that speaks to every heart throughout the world."
"It is a language which is underltod by all."
"In every region, every clime, the homage paid to it is the fame. In no one sentiment were ever mankind more generally agreed."
"FINALLY, the honour acquired by religion and virtue is honour divine and immortal. It is honour, not in the eftimation of men only, but in the fight of God; whose judgement is the standard of truth and right; whose approbation confers a Erowstn frown of glory that fadeth not away. All ."
"the honour we can gain among men is li- _ mited and confined. Its circle is narrow."
"Its duration is short and transitory. But the honour which is founded on true goodness, accompanies us through the whole progress of our existence. It enters with man into a future state; and continues to brighten throughout eternal ages. What procured him refped on earth, ilall render him estimable among the great affcmbly of angels, and firits of just men made perfect; where, we are assured, they who have been eminent in righteousness fllall ine as the brightnef of the firmament, and at the Jfars for ever and ever '.-Earthly honours are both shortlived in their continuance, and, while they last, tarnished with spots and Rfains. On some quarter or other, their brightness is obscured; their exaltation is humbled. But the honour which proceeds from God, and virtue, is unmixed and pure. It is a lustre which is * Daniel xii. 3."

Whereas the honours which the world confers resemble the feeble and twinkling flame of a taper; which is often clouded by the smoke it fends forth; is always wafting; and soon dies totally away."
"LET him, therefore, who retains any sense of human dignity; who feels within him that desire of honour which is congenial to man, aspire to the gratification of this passion by methods which are worthy of his nature. Let him not reft on any of those external diftin&ions which vanity has contrived to introduce. These can procure him no more than the semblance of refpedt.

"gious part of this character there is any thing which carts over it a gloomy ihade, or derogates from that esteem which men are generally disposed to yield to exemplary virtues.

"But to true religion there belongs no fulC 2 len BE RM. len gloom; no melancholy austerity, tend."
"-,_ - to withdraw men from human society, "
"or to diminith the exertions of active virtue. On the contrary, the religious principle, rightly understood, not only unites with all such virtues, but supports, fortifies, and confirms them. It is so far from obscuring the lustre of a character, that it heightens and ennobles it. It adds to all the moral virtues a venerable and authoritative dignity. It renders the virtuous characer more august. To the decorations of a palace, it joins the majesty of a temple."
"He who divides religion from virtue, "
"understands neither the one, nor the other."
"It is the union of the two which confummates the human character and state. It is their union which has distinguished those great and illustrious men, who have lhone with so much honour in former ages; and whose memory lives in the remembrance of succeeding generations. It is their union which forms that wisdom which is from above; that wisdom to which the text ascribes ascribes such high effects; and to which belongs the sublime encomium given of it _ by an author of one of the apocryphal books of Scripture; with whose beautiful and emphatical expreflions I conclude this discourse. bThe memorial of virtue is immortal. It is known with God, and with men."

"# SERMON  On SENSIBILITY. ROMANS, xii. 15. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
". HE amiable spirit of our holy reli. -, . gion appears in nothing more than in the care it hath taken to enforce on men the social duties of life. This is one of the clearef charateriftics of its being a reli."
"gion whose origin is divine: For every doctrine which proceeds from the Father of mercies will undoubtedly breathe benevolence and humanity. This is the scope of the two exhortations in the text, to rejoice with them that rejoice, and to weep with them that that weep; the one calculated to promote SER ."
"the happiness, the other, to alleviate the _ sorrows of our fellow-creatures; both concurring to form that temper which interests us in the concerns of our brethren; which disposes us to feel along with them, to take part in their joys, and in their sorrows."
"This temper is known by the name of Senfibility; a word, which in modern times we hear in the mouth of every one; a quality, which every one affects to poflefs; in itself, a most amiable and worthy difpofition of mind; but often mistaken and abused; employed as a cover, sometimes, to capricious humour; sometimes, to selfish passions. I {hall endeavour to explain the nature of true sensibility. I shall confider its effects: and after tiowing its advantages, liall point out the abuses, and miftaken forms of this virtue."
"THE original constitution of our nature with respect to the mixture of selfish and social affeiions, discovers in this, as in every other part of our frame, profound and 4 admirable  admirable wisdom. Each individual is, by ip__, his Creator, committed particularly to him."
"'self, and his own care. He has it more in his power to promote his own welfare, than any other person can possibly have to prolnote it. It was therefore fit, it was neceffary, that in each individual felf-love lhould be the strongest and most active inftint."
"This felf-love, if he had been a being who flood solitary and alone, might have proved sufficient for the purpose both of his preservation, and his welfare. But such is not the situation of man. He is mixed among multitudes of the fame nature. In these multitudes, the felf-love of one man, or attention to his particular interest, encountering the felf-love and the interests of another, could not but produce frequent opposition, and innumerable mischiefs. It was necessary, therefore, to provide a counterbalance to this part of his nature; which is accordingly done, by implanting in him those social and benevolent inftinds which lead him in some measure out of himself, to follow the interest of others. The strength of of these social inflincs is, in general, "
"portioned to their importance in human life. Hence that degree of sensibility which prompts us to weep with them that weep, is stronger than that which prompts us to rejoice with them that rejoice; for this reason, that the unhappy stand more in need of our fellow-feeling and affiltance than the prosperous. Still however it was requisite; that in each individual the quantity of self."
"love should remain in a large proportion, on account of its importance to the prefervation of his life and well-being. But as the quantity requisite for this purpose is apt both to ingrofs his attention, and to carry him into criminal excesses, the perfection of his nature is measured by the due counterpoise of those social principles which, tempering the force of the selfish affection, render man equally useful to himself, and to those with whom he is joined in society. Hence the use and the value of that sensibility of which we now treat THAT it constitutes an eflential part of a religious BERM. religious character, there can be no doubt."
"Not only are the words of the text express to this purpose, but the whole New Testament abounds with passages which enjoin the cultivation of this disposition. Being all one body, and members one of another, we are commanded to love our neighbour as ourself; to look every marn not on his own things only, but on those of others also; to be pitiful, to be courteou#, to be tender-hearted; to bear ne another burdens, and so to fkjil the law of Cbr/i *. The dispositions opposite to sensibility are, cruelty, hardness of heart, contrated attachment to worldly interests; which every one will admit to be directly opposite to the Christian charater. According to the different degrees of conftitutional warmth in men affecions, sensibility may, even among the virtuous, prevail in different proportions. For all derive not from nature the fame happy delicacy, and tenderness of feeling. With some, the heart * Lukr,  27.; Philip.  4.; 1 Peter, iii. 8.; Ephef."
"iiv. 3. Galat.  ,."
"melts, and relents, in kind emotions, much more easily than with others. But with ,_ every one who aspires to the charater of a good man, it is neceflary that the humane and compaflionate dispositions should be found. There must be that within him which shall form him to feel in some degree with the heart of a brother; and when he beholds others enjoying happiness, or fees them funk in sorrow, shall bring his asfecions to accord, and, if we -may speak so, to found a note unison to theirs. This is to rejoice with them that rejoice, and to weep with them that weep. How much this temper belongs to the perfection of our nature, we learn from one who exhibited that perfection in its highest degree."
"When our Lord Jesus, on a certain occasion, came to the grave of a beloved friend, and saw his relations mourning around it, he presently caught the impreflion of their sorrow; be groaned in ]firit, and was troubled. He knew that he was about to remove the cause of their distress, by recalling Lazarus to life: Yet, in the moment RM. ment of grief, his heart sympathised with I__ theirs; and, together with the weeping friends, Yefus wept *."
"LET us next proceed to confider the esfed of this virtuous sensibility on our charater, and our state. I shall confider it in two views; its influence on our moral conduat, and its influence on our happiness."
"FIRST, it powerfully influences the proper discharge of all the relative and social duties of life. Without some discharge of those duties there could be no comfort or security in human society. Men would become hordes of savages, perpetually haraffing one another. In one way or other, therefore, the great duties of social life must he performed. There muff be among mankind some reciprocal co-operation and aid."
"In this, all consent. But let us observe, that these duties may be performed from different principles, and in different ways."
"Sometimes they are performed merely from * John,  3."
"decency decency and regard to charadter; some- "
"times from fear, and even from felfifhnefs, ,__ which obliges men to ihow kindness, in order that they may receive returns of it. In such cafcs, the exterior of fair behaviour may be preserved. But all will admit, that when from constraint only, the offices of seeming kindness are performed, little dependance can be placed on them, and little value allowed to them."
"By others, these offices are discharged solely from a principle of duty. They are men of cold affections, and perhaps of an interested characer. But, overawed by a sense of religion, and convinced that they are bound to be beneficent, they fulfil the course of relative duties with regular tenor."
"Such men act from conscience and principle. So far they do well, and are worthy of praise. They assist their friends; they give to the poor; they do justice to all. But what a different complexion is given to the fame aftions, how much higher flavour do they acquire, when they floW from the sensibility of a feeling heart ? If one ERM. one be not moved by affection, even sup."
"-_. posing him influenced by principle, he will go no farther than ftrid principle appears to require. He will advance flowly, and reluctantly. As it is justice, not generosity, which impells him, he will often feel as a talk what he is required by conscience to perform. Whereas, to him who is prompted by virtuous sensibility, every office of beneficence and humanity is a pleasure. He gives, assists, and relieves, not merely because he is bound to do so, but because it would be painful for him to refrain. Hence, the smallest benefit he confers rifes in its value, on account of its carrying the affection of the giver impressed upon the gift. It speaks his heart; and the discovery of the heart is very frequently of greater consequence than all that liberality can beitow. How often will the affectionate smile of approbation gladden the humble, and raise the dejeted? How often will the look of tender sympathy, or the tear that involuntarily falls, impart confolaton to the unhappy ? By means of this correspondence correspondence of hearts, all the great du- SER ties which we owe to one another are both _ performed to more advantage, and endeared in the performance. From true fenfibility flow a thousand good offices, apparently small in themselves, but of high impor."
"tance to the felicity of others; offices which altogether escape the observation of the cold and unfeeling, who, by the hardness of their manner, render themselves unamiable, even when they mean to do good.-How happy then would it be for mankind, if this affeAionate disposition prevailed more go-, nerally in the world! How much would the fum of public virtue and public felicity be increased, if men were always inclined to rejoice with them that rejoice, and to weep witb them that weep !"
"BUT, besides the effeCt of such a temper on general virtue and happiness, let us confider its effect on the happiness of him who poffefles it, and the various pleasures to which it gives him access. If he be maftcr of riches or influence, it affords him the  the means of increasing his own enjoy,__,^ ment, by relieving the wants, or increasing the comforts of others. If he command not these advantages, yet all the comforts which he fees in the plofeiffion of the deserving become in some fort his, by his rejoicing in the good which they enjoy."
"Even the face of nature yields a fatisfaction to him which the insensible can never know. The profusion of goodness which he beholds poured forth on the universe, dilates his heart with the thought that innumerable multitudes around him are blest and happy. When he fees the labours of men appearing to prosper, and views a country flourilhing in wealth and industry ; when he beholds the spring coming forth in its beauty, and reviving the decayed face of nature; or in autumn beholds the fields loaded with plenty, and the year crowned with all its fruits; he lifts his affections with gratitude to the great Father of all, and rejoices in the general felicity and joy."
"It may indeed be objected, that the fame sensibility sensibility lays open the heart to be pier- "
"ced with many wounds from the distresses ,_ which abound in the world; exposes us to frequent fufering from the participation which it conmmunicates of the sorrows, as well as of the joys of friendihip. But let it be confidered, that the tender melancholy of sympathy is accompanied with a fenfation, which they who feel it would not exchange for the gratifications of the felfilhb When the heart is strongly moved by any of the kind affetions, even when it pours itself forth in virtuous sorrow, a secret attractive charm mingles with the painful emotion; there is a joy in the midst of grief. Let it be farther confidered, that the griefs which sensibility intro."
"duces are counterbalanced by pleasures which flow from the fame source. Senfibility heightens in general the human powers, and is conneced with acuteness in all our feelings. If it make us more alive to tome painful sensations, in return, it renders the pleaing ones more vivid and animated. The selfish man hanguiihes in  III. his  his narrow circle of pleasures. They are _^ confined to what affects his own interet."
"He is obliged to repeat the fame gratifications, till they become insipid. But the man of virtuous sensibility moves in a wider sphere of felicity. His powers arc much more frequently called forth into occupations of plcafing aCtivity. Numberlcfs occafions open to him of indulging his favourite taltc, by conveying fatisfation to others. Often it is in his power, in one way or other, to sooth the afflicted heart; to carry some consolation into the house of woe. In the scenes of ordinary life, in the domestic and social intercourses of men, the cordiality of his affections chears and gladdens him. Every appearance, every description of innocent happiness, is enjoyed by him. Every native expression of kindness and affection among others is felt by him, even though he be not the object of it. Among a circle of friends, enjoying one another, he is as happy as the happiest."
"In a word, he lives in a different fort of world from what the selfish man inhabits."
"He He posseses a new sense, which enables him to behold objecs which the felfifih cannot fee. At the fame time, his enjoyments are not of that kind which remain merely on the surface of the mind. They penetrate the heart. They enlarge and elevate, they refine and ennoble it. To all the pleasing emotions of affection, they add the dignified consciousness of virtue.Children of men ! Men formed by nature to live and to feel as brethren ! How long will ye continue to estrange yourselves from one another by competitions and jealoufies, when in cordial union ye might be so much more blest ? How long will ye seek your happiness in felfith gratifications alone, negleding those purer and better sources of joy, which flow from the assections and the heart ?"
"HAVING now explained the nature, and shown the value and high advantages of true sensibility, I proceed to point out some of the mistaken forms, and abuses of this virtue.-- In modern times, the chief imD 2 provement  provement of which we have to boast, is a __. _sense of humanity. This, notwithltanding the felfithnels that still prevails, is the favourite and distinguishing virtue of the age."
"On general manners, and on several departments of flciety, it has had considerable influence. It has abated the spirit of perfecution: It has even tempered the horrors of war; and man is now more ashamed than he was in some former ages, of acting as a savage to man. Hence, sensibility is become so reputable a quality, that the appearance of it is frequently assumed when the reality is wanting. Softness of manners must not be mistaken for true fenfibility. Sensibility indeed tends to produce gentlcnefs in behaviour; and when such behaviour flows from native affetion, it is valuable and amiable. Bur'the exterior manner alone may be learned in the school of the world; and often, too often, is found to cover much unfeeling hardncfs of heart."
"Professions of sensibility on every trifling occasion, joined with the appearance of exceffive softness, and a profusion of sentimental mental language, afford always much "
"ground for distrust They create the sus- _ _ picion of a studied charader. Frequently, under a negligent and seemingly rough manner, there lies a tender and feeling heart. Manlinefi and sensibility are so far from being incompatible, that the truly brave are, for the most part, generous and humane; while the soft and effeminate are hardly capable of any vigorous exertion of afferion."
"As sensibility supposes delicacy of feeling with refped to others, they who asfe& the highest fen4ibility are apt to carry this delicacy to excess. They are, perhaps, not incapable of the warmth of disinterested friendihip; but they are become so refined in all, their sensations; they entertain such high notions of what ought to correspond in the feelings of others to their own; they are so mightily hurt by every thing which comes not up to their ideal standard of reciprocal affe&ion, as to produce disquiet and uneasiness to all with 3 whom  whom they are connected. Hence, unjust suspicions of their friends; hence, groundless upbraidings, and complaints of unkindness; hence, a proneness to take violent oftence at trifles. In consequence of examining their friends with a microfcopic eye, what to an ordinary observer would not be unpleafing, to them is grating and disgusting. At the bottom of the charader of such pcrfons there always lie much pride, and attention to themselves."
"This is indeed a false species of sensibility."
"It is the fubltitution of a capricious and irritable delicacy, in the room of that plain and native tenderness of heart, which prompts men to view others with indulgent eye, and to make great allowances for the imperfections which are sometimes adherent to the most amiable qualities."
"THERE are others who affect not fenfibility to this extreme, but who found high claims to themselves upon the degree of intercft which they take in the concerns of others. Although their sensibility can produce produce no benefit to the person who is its object, they always conceive that it i."
"titles themselves to some profitable returns."
"These, often, are persons of refined and artful characer; who partly deceive themselves, and partly employ their icnfibility as a cover to interest. He who acs from genuine affection, when he is feeling along with others in their joys or sorrows, thinks not of any recompence to which this gives him a title. He follows the impulse of his heart. He obeys the dictate of his nature; just as the vine by its nature produces fruit, and the fountain pours forth its freams. Wherever views of interest, and profpeAs of return, mingle with the feelings of affection, sensibility ads an impersect part, and intitles us to small fliare of praise."
"BUT supposing it to be both complete and pure, I must caution you against refting the whole merit of your character on sensibility alone. It is indeed a happy conifitution of mind. It fits men for the proD 4 per  per discharge of many duties, and gives , them access to many virtuous pleasures."
"It is requisite for our acceptance either with God or man. At the fame time, if it remain an inftinivc feeling alone, it will form no more than an imperfec charader. Complete virtue is of a more exalted and dignified nature. It supposes sensibility, good temper, and benevolent affedions; it includes them as essential parts; but it reaches farther: It supposes them to be strengthened and confirmed by principle; it requires them to be supported by justice, temperance, fortitude, and all those other virtues which enable us to with propriety, in the trying situations of life."
"It is very pofflble for a man to poflefs the kind affedions in a high degree, while, at the fame time, he is carried away by paflion and pleasure into many criminal deeds. Almost every man values himself on possessing virtue in one or other of its forms. He wishes to lay claim to some quality which will render him estimable in in his own eye, as well as in that of the SERb!"
"IL public. Hence, it is common for many, , especially for those in the higher classes of life, to take much praise to themselves on account of their sensibility, though it be, in truth, a fcnfibility of very defective kind."
"They relent at the view of misery when it is strongly set before them. Often too, affe chiefly by the powers of description, it is at feigned and pictured distress, more than at real mifery,that they relent. The tears which they ihed upon these occasions they confider as undoubted proofs of virtue. They applaud themselves for the goodness of their hearts; and conclude, that with such feelings they cannot fail to be agreeable to Heaven. At the fame time, these transient relentings make flight impreflion on conduct They give rife to few, if any, good deeds; and soon after such persons have wept at some tragical tale, they are ready to stretch forth the hand of oppression, to grasp at the gain of injustice, or to plunge into the torrent of criminal pleasures. This fort of fenfibility affords no more than a fallacious claim BERM. claim to virtue, and gives men no ground to think highly of themselves. We must inquire not merely how they feel, but how their feelings prompt them to a&, in order to ascertain their real character."
"I SHALL conclude with observing, that sensibility, when genuine and pure, has a itrong connection with piety. That warmth of affection, and tendcrnefs of heart, which lead men to feel for their brethren, and to enter into their joys and sorrows, should naturally dispose them to melt at the remembrance of the divine goodness; to glow with admiration of the divine majefty; to fend up the voice of praise and adoration to that Supreme Being who makes his creatures happy. He who pretends to great sensibility towards men, and yet has no feeling for the high objecs of religion, no heart to admire and adore the great Father of the universe, has reason to diitruft the truth and delicacy of his fenfibility. He has reason to fufpet, that in some corner of his heart there lodges a fecret cret depravity, an unnatural hardness and callousness, which vitiates his character. _ - Let us study to join all the parts of virtue in proper union; to be consistently and uniformly good; just and upright, as well as pitiful and courteous; pious, as well as sympathising. Let us pray to him who made the heart, that he would fill it with all proper dispositions; rectify all its errors; and render it the happy abode of personal integrity and social tenderness, of purity, benevolence, and devotion."
"# SERMON III. On the IMPROVEMENT of TIME. GENESIS, xlvii. 8. And Pharoob said unto Jacob, How old art thou?"
"On the IMPROVEMENT of TIME."
"GENESIS, xlvii. 8."
".nd Pharob said unto Jaob, How old art tbou 'IME is of so great importance to man _ I. kind, that it cannot too often employ religious meditation. There is nothing in the management of which wisdom is more requisite, or where mankind display their inconsistency more. In its particular parcels, they appear entirely careless of it; and throw it away with thoughtless profusion."
"But, when colleted into some of its great portions, and viewed as the measure of their continuance in life, they become fenfible sibe of its value, and begin to regard it with a serious eye. While day after day is I wafted in a course of idleness or vicious pleasures, if some incident shall occur which leads the moit inconsiderate man to think of his age, or time of life; how much of it is gone; at what period of it he is now arrived; and to what proportion of it he can with any probability look forward, as yet to come; he can hardly avoid feeling some secret compunction, and reflieing seriously upon his state. Happy, if that virtuous imprefllon were not of momenary continuance, but retained its influence amidst the succeeding cares and pleasures of the world To the good old Patriarch mentioned in the text, we have reason to believe that such impreflions were habitual. The question put to him by the Egyptian monarch produced, in his answer, such refletions as were naturally suited to his time of life. And Vacob said unto Pharaoh, tbe days of the years of my pilXrimage are an hundred and thirty years:"
"few and evil have the dayo of the years of my Ife  life been, and have not attained unto the days a__, of the years of the life of my fathers, in the days of their pilgrimage. But the peculiar circumstances of the Patriarch, or the number of his years, are not to be the subjec of our present consideration. My purpose is, to show how we should be affected in every period of human life, by reflection upon our age, whether we be young, or advanced in years; in order that the question, How old art thou ? may never be put to any of us without some good effe&."
"There are three different portions of our life which such a quetion naturally calls to view; that part of it which is pall; that which is now present; and that to which we fondly look forward, as future. Let us confider in what manner we ought to be affected by attending to each of theft."
"1. LET us review that part of our time which is past. According to the progress which we have made in the journey of life, the, field which past years present to our review will be more or less extensive. But to to every one they will be found to afford hi sufficient matter of humiliation and regret."
"For where is the perbon, who having ated for any time in the world, remembers not many errors, and many follies, in his pas behaviour ? Who dares to fay, that he has improved, as he might have done, the various advantages which were afforded him; and that he recalls nothing for which he has reason either to grieve, or to bluih ?"
"When we recolled the several stages of life through which we have passed; the fucceflive occupations in which we have been engaged, the designs we have formed, and the hopes and fears which alternately have filled our breast; how barren for most part is the remembrance; and how few traces of any thing valuable or important remain? Like characters drawn on the sand, which the next wave washes totally away, so one trivial fuccefflon of events has effaced the memory of the preceding; and though we have seemed all along to be bufy, yet for much of what we have ated, we are neither wiser nor better than if such actions ER  actions had never been. Hence, let the re_it. trofpect of what is past produce, as its first effea, humiliation in our own eyes, and abasement before God. Much do human pride and felf-complacency require some correcion; and that correction is never more effecually administered, than by an impartial and serious review of former life."
"But though past time be gone, we are not to confider it as irredeemably loft To a very profitable purpose it may yet be applied, if we lay hold of it while it remains in remembrance, and oblige it to contribute to future improvement. If you have gained nothing more by the years that are past, you have at least gained experience; and experience is the mother of wisdom. You have seen the weak parts of your character; and may have discovered the chief sources of your mifcondud. To these let your attention be directed; on these, let the proper guards be set. If you have trifled long, resolve to trifle no more. If your paslions have often betrayed and degraded you, study how they may be kept, in future, "
"under under better discipline. Learn, at the fame sE time, never to truit presumptuously in your , own wisdom. Humbly apply to the Author of your being, and beseech his grace to guide you safely through those slippery and dangerous paths, in which experience has shown that you are so ready to err, and to fall."
"In reviewing past life, it cannot but occur, that many things now appear of inconsiderable importance, which once occupied and attached uss in the highest degree. Where ate those keen competitions, those mortifying disappointments, those violent enmities, those eager purfiits, which we once thought were to last for ever, and on which we confideted our whole happinefa or misery as ffpended ? We look back upon them now, as upon a dream which has pafied away. None of those mighty consequences have followed which we had predited. The airy fabric has vanilhed, and left no trace behind it. We fmine at our former violence; and wonder how such- things could have ever appeared  III. so  significant and great. We may reft ali a_. fured, that what hath been, shall again be."
"When Time fiall once have laid his lenient hand on the paflions and pursuits of the present moment, they too shall lore that imaginary value which heated fancy now bestows upon them. Hence, let them already begin to subside to their proper level Let wisdom infuse a tinture of moderation into the eagerness of contest, by anticipating that period of coolness, which the lapse of time will, of itself, certainly bring.When we look back on years that are past, how swiftly do they appear to have fleeted away ? How insensibly has one period of life stolen upon us after another, like the successive incidents in a tale that is told ?"
"Before we were aware, childhood had grown up into youth; youth had pafred into manhood; and manhood now, perhaps, begins to assume the gray hair, and to decline into old age. When we are carrying our views forward, months and years to come seem to stretch through a long and extenfive space. But when the time flall arrive of of our looking back, they fliall appear contraded within narrow bounds. Time, when _, yet before us, seems to advance with flow and tardy steps; no sooner is it past, than we discern its wings."
"It is a remarkable peculiarity in the retrofped of former life, that it is commonly attended with some measure of heaviness of heart. Even to the most prosperous, the memory of joys that are past is accompanied with secret sorrow. In the days of former years, many objeds arise to view, which make the most unthinking, grave; and render the serious, fad. The pleafurable scenes of youth, the objects on which our affetions had been early placed, the companions and friends with whom we had spent many happy days, even the places and the occupations to which we had been long accustomed, but to which we have now bid farewell, can hardly ever be recalled, without softening, nor sometimes, without piercing, the heart. Such sensations, to which few, if any, of my hearers, are wholly strangers, I now mention, as 2 affording  affording a strong proof of that vanity of III."
"__- -. the human slate, which is so often represented in the sacred writings: And vain indeed mhft that state be, where shades of grief tinge the recollection of its brightest scenes. But, at the fame time, though it be very proper that such meditations should sometimes enter the mind, yet on them I advise not the gentle and tender heart to dwell too long. They are apt to produce a fruitless melancholy; to deje  without bringing much improvement; to thicken the gloom which already hangs over human life, without furnishing proportionable affifance to virtue."
"Let me advise you, rather to recall to vitw such parts of former condud, if any such there be, as afford in the remembrance a rational fatisfadion. And what parts of conduc are these ? Are they the purfiits of sensual pleasure, the riots of jollity, or the displays of show and vanity ? No; I appeal to your hearts, my friends, if what you recolled with most pleasure be not the innocent, the virtuous, the honourable pars of of your past life; when you were employ- "
"ed in cultivating your minds, and impro-  ving them with useful knowledge; when, by regular application and persevering labour, you were laying the foundation of future reputation and advancement; when you were occupied in discharging with sidelity the duties of your station, and acquiring the'efteem of the worthy and the good; when in some trying situation you were enabled to your part with firmness and honour; or had seized the happy opportunity of assisting the deserving, of relieving the distressed, and bringing down upon your heads the blefngs of tbo that were ready to perijh.-Thefe, these are the parts of former life which are recalled with most fatisfacdion On them alone, no heaviness of heart attends. You enjoy them as a treasure which is now stored up, and put beyond all danger of being loft. These chear the hours of sadness, lighten the burden of old age, and, through the mortifying remembrance of much of the past, dart a ray of light and joy.-From the review E3 of  of thele, and the comparison of them with _I_ the deceitful pleasures of fin, let us learn how to form our estimate of happiness. Let us learn what is true, what is false, in human pleasures; and from experience of the past, judge of the quarter to which we mufl in future turn, if we would lay a foundation for permanent fatisfaaion. Aster having thus reviewed the former years of our life, let us confider, "
"II. WHAT attention is due to that period of age in which we are at present placed."
"Here lies the immediate and principal objet of our concern. For the recollection of the pals is only as far of moment, as it ats upon the present. The pald, to us now, is little; the future, as yet, is nothing. Between there two great gulphs of time subsists the present, as an isthmus or bridge, along which we are all palsing."
"With hasty and inconsiderate steps let us not pass along it; but remember well, how much depends upon our holding a steady, and properly conducted course. Whbatocver ever thine hand findeth to do, do it pow with "
"all thy miight; for now is the accepted time; now is the day of falvatien. Many directions might be given for the wife and religious improvement of the present; a few of which only I shall hint."
"Let us begin with excluding those superfluous avocations which unprofitably confume it. Life is fiort; much that is of real importance remains to be done. If we susser the present time to be wafted either in absolute idleness, or in frivolous employments, it will hereafter call for vengeance againif us. Removing therefore what is merely fupcrfluous, let us bethink ourselves of what is most material to be attended to at present: As, first and chief, the great work of our salvation; the difcharge of the religious duties which we owe to God our Creator, and to Christ our Redeemer. God waitetb as yet to be gracious; whether he will wait longer, none of us can tell. Now, therefore, feck the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while be is near. Our spiritual interests will be 4 belt BERM. best promoted by regular performance of ,__, all the duties of ordinary lfe. Let there, "
"therefore, occupy a great share of the present hour. Whatever our age, our character, our profeflion, or station in the world, requires us to do, in that let each revolving day find us busy. Never delay till to-morrow what reason and conscience tell you ought to be performed to-day. To-morrow is not yours; and though you should live to enjoy it, you must not overload it with a burden not its own. Suficient for the day will prove the duty thereof."
"The observance of order and method, is of high consequence for the improvement of present time. He who performs every employment in its due place and season, suffers no part of time to escape without profit. He multiplies his days; for he lives much in little space. Whereas he who neglefts order in the arrangement of his occupations, is always losing the present in returning upon the palt, and trying, in vain, to recover it when gone.-Let me advise you frequently to make the present employment employment of time an object of thought. ."
"Ask yourselves, about what are you now busied? What is the ultimate scope of your present pursuits and cares ?' Can you justify them to yourselves ? Are they likely to produce any thing that will survive the moment, and bring forth some fruit for futurity? He who can give no sati factory answer to such questions as these, has reason to fufpec that his employment of the present is not tending either to hit advantage, or his honour.- Finally let me admonish you, that while you study to improve, you should endeavour also to enjoy, the present hour. Let it not be difturbed with groundless discontents, or poiboned with foolifli anxieties about what is to come: But look up to Heaven, and acknowledge, with a grateful heart, the actual blessings you enjoy. If you muff admit, that you are now in health, peace, and safety; without any particular or uncommon evils to afflict your condition; what more can you reasonably look for in this vain and uncertain world ? How little can the  the greatest prosperity add to such a Rfate?"
"Will any future situation ever make you happy, if now, with so few causes of grief, you imagine yourselves miserable? The evil lies in the (tate of your mind, not in your condition of fortune; and by no alteration of circumstances is likely to be remedied. Let us now, "
"III. CONSIDER with what dispositions we ought to look forward to those years of our life that may yet be to come. Merely to look forward to them, is what requires no admonition. Futurity is the great objet on which the imaginations of men are employed; for the fake of which the past is forgotten, and the present too often negleded. All time is in a manner swallowed up by it. On futurity, men build their designs; on futurity, they reft their hopes; and though not happy at the present, they always reckon on becoming so, at some subsequent period of their lives. This propenfity to look forward, was for wife purpofcs implanted in the human breast. It serves serves to give proper occupation to the active ."
"powers of the mind, and to quicken all its itl exertions. But it is too often immoderately indulged, and grossly abused. The curiofity which sometimes prompts persons to inquire, by unlawful methods, into what is to come, is equally foolifi and sinful."
"Let us restrain all desire of penetrating farther than is allowed us, into that dark and unknown region. Futurity belongs to God:"
"and happy for us is that mysterious veil with which wisdom has covered it."
"Were it in our power to lift up the veil, and to behold what it conceals, many and many a thorn we would plant in our breasts. The proper and rational conduc of men with regard to futurity, is regulated by two considerations: First, that much of what it contains, must remain to us absolutely unknown; next, that there are also some events in it which may be certainly known and foreseen."
"First, much of futurity is, and mutt be, entirely unknown to us. When we fpeculate  late about the continuance of our life, and _._.~ the events which are to fill it, we behold a river which is always flowing; but which soon escapes out of our fight, and is covered with mists and darkness. Some of its windings we may endeavour to trace; but it is only for a very short way that we are able to pursue them. In endless conjectures we quickly find ourselves bewildered; and, often, the next event that happens baffles all the reasonings we had formed concerning the succession of events The consequence which follows from this is, that all the anxiety about futurity, which passes the bounds of reasonable precaution, is unprofitable and vain. Certain measures are indeed necessary to be taken for our safety. We are not to rulh forward inconsiderate and headlong. We must make, as far as we are able, provision for future welfare; and guard against dangers which apparently threaten. But having done this, we must stop; and leave the reft to Him who difpofeth of futurity at his will. He who fittetb in the heavens lalgbs at at the wifiom and the plans of worldly SER men. Wherefore, boafi not tbyfif of to-mor- row; for thobu kowe nrot what a day may kring forth. For the fame reason, despair not of to-morrow; for it may bring forth good as well as evil Vex not yourselves with imaginary fears. The impending black cloud, to which you look up with so much dread, may pass by harmless; or though it should discharge the storm, yet, before it breaks, you may be lodged in that lowly mansion which no storms ever touch."
"In the next place, there are in futurity some events which may be certainly foreseen by us, through all its darkness. Sirs, it may be confidently predited, that no situation into which it will bring us, mall ever answer fully to our hopes, or confer perfet happiness. This is as certain as if we already saw it, that life, in its future periods, will continue to be what it has heretofore been; that it will be a mixed and varied state; a checquered scene of pleafuros and pains, of fugitive joys and transient  transient griefs, succeeding in a round to one another. Whether we look forward to the years of youth, or to those of man."
"hood and advanced life, it is all the fame."
"The world will be to us, what it has been to generations pall. Set out, therefore, on what remains of your journey under this persuasion. According to this measure, eftitnate your future pleasures; and calculate your future gains. Carry always along with you a modest and a temperate mind."
"Let not your expectations from the years that are to come rife too high; and your disappointments will be fewer, and more easily supported."
"Farther; this may be reckoned upon as certain, that in every future situation of life, a good conscience, a well ordered mind, and a humble trust in the favour of Heaven, will prove the essential ingredients of your happiness. In reflecting upon the past, you have found this to hold. Assure yourselves that in future, the cafe will be the fame. The principal correfives of human vanity and distress, must be fought for in religion religion and virtue. Entering on paths SS "
"which to you are new and unknown, place _ yourselves under the conduct of a divine guide. Follow the great Shepherd of lirael, who, amidst the turmoil of this world, leads his flock into green pafltures, and by the Jlill waters. As you advance in life, study to improve both in good principles, and in good practice. You will be enabled to look to futurity without fear, if, whatever it brings, it flall find you regularly employed in doing jflly, loving mercy, and walking humbly with the Lord youzr God."
"Lastly, Whatever other things may be dubious in futurity, two great events are undoubtedly certain, death and judgement."
"These, we all know, are to terminate the whole course of time; and we know them to be not only certain, but to be approaching nearer to us, in consequence of every day that passes over our heads. To these, therefore, let us look foward, not with the dread of children, but with that manly ferioufnefs which belongs to men and Chritians. Let us not avert our view from them, "
" them, as if we could place them at some   greater distance by excluding them from our thoughts. This indeed is the refuge of too many; but it is the refuge of fools, ';ho aggravate thereby the terrors they mnut encounter. For be that cometb, all come, and will not tarry. To his coming, let us look with a steady eye; and as life advances through its progressive stages, prepare for its close, and for appearing before him who made us."
"THUS I have endeavoured to point out the reflections proper to be made, when the question is put to any of us, How old art thou? I have shown with what eye we should review the past years of our life; in what light we {hould confider the present; and with what dispositions look forward to the future: In order that such a question may always leave some serious impression behind it; and may dispose usfo to number the years of our life, that we tay apply our hearts inta witfdom."

is a season; and a time to every purpose _ under heaven *.

a__rJ Piety to God, and charity to men, are incumbent upon persons of every age, as soon as they can think and  Yet these virtues, in different stages of life, assume different forms; and when they appear in that form which is most suited to our age, they appear with peculiar gracefulpefs; they give propriety to conduct, and add dignity to character. In former discourses I have treated of the virtues which adorn youth, and of the duties which specially belong to old age  The circle of those duties which refpec middle age is indeed much larger. As that is the busy period in the life of man, it includes in effect the whole compass of religion, and therefore cannot have its peculiar characer so definitely marked and ascertained. At the fame time, during those years wherein one is sensible that he has advanced beyond the confines of youth, but has not yet passed into the region of old age, there are fe* Ecclcf. li. xi. See  I. Sermons I . and 12.

veral veral things which reflection on that por-  of human life suggests, or at least _ ought to suggest, to the mind. Inconfiderate must he be, who, in his gradual progress throughout middle age, pauses not, at times, to think, how far he is now receding from youth; how near he draws to the borders of declining age; what part it is now incumbent on him to act; what duties both God and the world have a title to expect from him. To these, I am at present to call your attention; as what materially concern the greatest part of those who are now my hearers.

1. I BEGIN with observing, that the sirs duty of those who are become men is, as the text expresses it, to put away cbildi tbingr. The season of youthful levities, follies, and pamilons, is now over. These have had their reign; a reign perhaps too long; and to which a termination is certainly proper at last Much indulgence is due to youth. Many things admit of excufe then, which afterwards become unpardonable. Some things may even be   graceful in youth, which, if not criminal, 
are at Icaft ridiculous, in persons of maturer years. It is a great trial of wisdom, to make our retreat from youth with propriety; to assume the character of manhood, without cxpofing ourselves to reproach, by an unflafonablc remainder of juvenility, on the one hand, or by precise and difgufling formality, on the other.
Nature has placed certain boundaries, by which she discriminates the pleasures, actions, and employments, that are suited to the different stages of human life. It becomes us, neither to overleap those boundaries by a transition too hafly and violent; nor to hover too long on one of the limit, when nature calls us to pass over to the other.

There are particularly two things in which middle age should preserve its diftinction and efparation from youth; these are, levities of behaviour, and intemperate indulgence of pleasure. The gay spirits of the young often prompt an inconsiderate degree degree of levity, Sometimes amusing, some- sE 
times offensive; but for which, though  traying them occasionally into serious dangers, their want of experience may plead excuse. A more composed, and manly behaviour is expected in riper years. The affecation of youthful vanities, degrades the dignity of manhood; even renders its manners less agreeable; and by aukward attempts to please, produces contempt.
Chearfulnefs is becoming in every age.
But the proper chearfulnefs of a man is as different from the levity of the boy, as the flight of the eagle is from the fluttering of a sparrow in the air.

As all unseasonable returns to the levity of youth ought to be laid afide,-an admonition whith equally belongs to both the fexes,-itill more are we to guard against those intemperate indulgences of pleasure, to which the young are unhappily prone.
From these we cannot too soon retreat.
They open the path to ruin, in every period of our days. As long, however, as these excesses are confined to the first stage 3 of  of life, hope is left, that when this fever of  the spirits shall abate, sobriety may gain the ascendant, and wiser counsels have power to influence conduct. But after the season of youth is palt, if its intemperate fpirit remain; if, inflead of listening to the calls of honour, and bending attention to the cares, and the business of men, the fame course of idleness and sensuality continue to be pursued, the cafe becomes more desperate. A fad presumption arifes, that long immaturity is to prevail; and that the pleasures and passions of the youth are to fink and overwhelm the man.
Difficult, I confess, it may prove to overcome the attachments which youthful habits had for a long while been forming. Hard, at the beginning, is the talk, to impose on our conduct restraints which are altogether unaccufRomed and new. But this is a trial which every one mull undergo, in entering on new fcencs of ation, and new periods of life. Let those who are in this situation bethink themfelvcs, that all is now at flake. Their character and honour, their future future fortune and success in the world, 
depend in a great measure on the fleps they 
take, when first they appear on the stage of adcive life. The world then looks to them with observing eye. It studies their behaviour; and interprets all their motions, as presages of the line of future conduc which they mean to hold. Now, therefore, put away cbildib Ibings; dismiss your former trifling anufements, and youthful pleasures; blast not the hopes which your friends are willing to conceive of you.
Higher occupations, more serious cares, await you. Turn your mind to the steady and vigorous discharge of the part you are called to a&. This leads me,   To point out the particular duties which open on those who are in the middle period of life. They are now come forward to that field of ation where they are to mix in all the stir and bustle of the world; where all the human powers are brought forth into full exercise; where all all that is conceived to be important in huF 4 man  man affairs is incessantly going on around ,.__ them. The time of youth was the prepation for future ation. In old age our active part is supposed to be finiihed, and reft is permitted. Middle age is the season when we are expected to display the fruits which education had prepared and ripened. In this world, all of us were formed to be asfiltants to one another. The wants of society call for every man labour, and require various departments to be filled up.
They require that some be appointed to rule, and others to obey; some, to defend the society from danger, others to maintain its internal order and peace; some, to provide the conveniencies of life, others to promote the improvement of the mind; many, to work; others to contrive and direA. In short, within the sphere of society there is employment for every one; and in the course of these employments, many a moral duty is to be performed; many a religious grace to be exercised. No one is permitted to be a mere blank in the world.
No rank, nor station, no dignity of birth, 
nor nor extent of possessions, exempt any man from contributing his mharc to public uti- _.
lity and good. This is the precept of God.
This is the voice of nature. This is the just demand of the human race upon one another.

One of the first questions, therefore, 
which every man who is in the vigour of his age should put to himself is,  What am I doing in this world ? What have I yet done, whereby I may glorify God,  and be useful to my fellows ? Do I pro perly fill up the place which belongs to ' my rank and station ? Will any memo' rial remain of my having existed on the  earth ? or are my days pafling fruitless away, now when I might be of some importance in the system of human affairs ?"
"-Let not any man imagine that he is of no importance, and has, upon that account, a privilege to trifle with his days at pleasure. Talents have been give to all; to some, ten; to others, five; to others, two. Occupy with tbefe * till I come, is the Luke, xix. 13."
"command MI. command of the great Master to all. Where  , fiuperior abilities are poffeflfd, or diftinguiflhed advantages of fortune are enjoyed, a wider range is afforded for useful exertion, and the world is intitled to expec it."
"But among those who fill up the inferior departments of society, though the sphere of usefulness be more contraced, no one is left entirely insignificant. Let us remember, that in all stations and conditions, the important relations take place, of mafiers or fcrvants, husbands and wives, parents and children, brothers and friends, citizens and fubjeAs. The discharge of the duties ariiing from those various relations, forms a great portion of the work assigned to the middle age of man. Though the part we have to aa may be confined within a humble line, yet if it be honourably a  it will be always found to carry its own reward."
"In fine, industry, in all its virtuous forms, ought to inspirit and invigorate manhood. This will add to it both satisfaction facion and dignity; will make the current ER "
"of our years, as they roll, flow along in a clear and equable fiream, without the putrid stagnation of sloth and idleness. Idleness is the great corrupter of youth; and the bane and dishonour of middle age. He who, in the prime of life, finds time to hang heavy on his hands, may with much reason suspect, that he has not consulted the duties which the consideration of his age imposed upon him; assuredly he has not consulted his own halpinefs. But amidst all the bustle of the world, let us not forget, "
"III. To guard with vigilance againrt the peculiar dangers which attend the period of middle life. It is much to be regretted, that in the present state of things there is no period of man age in which his virtue is not exposed to perils. Pleasure lays its snares for youth: and after the season of youthful follies is past, other temptations, no less formidable to virtue, presently arise."
"The  The love of pleasure is succeeded by the ,_. palion for interest. In this passion the whole mind is too often absorbed; and the change thereby induced on the character is of no amiable kind. Amidst the excesses of youth, virtuous affections often remain."
"The attachments of friendihip, the love of honour, and the warmth of sensibility, give a degree of lustre to the character, and cover many a failing. But interest, when it is become the ruling principle, both debases the mind, and hardens the heart. It deadens the feeling of every thing that is sublime or refined. It contracts the affections within a narrow circle; and extinguishes all those sparks of generosity and tenderness which once glowed in the breast."
"In proportion as worldly pursuits multiply, and competitions rife, ambition, jealoufy, and envy, combine with interest to excite bad passions, and to increase the corruption of the heart. At first, perhaps, it was a man intention to advance himself in the world by none but fair and laudable methods. He retained for some time an aver- "
"'sion to whatever appeared dithonourable.  "
"But here, he is encountered by the violence of an enemy. There, he is supplanted by the address of a rival. The pride of a fuperior insults him. The ingratitude of a friend provokes him. Animofities ruffle his temper. Suspicions poison his mind."
"He finds, or imagines that he finds, the artful and designing surrounding him on every hand. He views corruption and iniquity prevailing; the modest neglected; the forward and the crafty rising to diftinction. Too easily, from the example of others, he learns that mystery of vice, called the way of the world. What he has learned he fancies necessary to pracfife for his own defence; and of course assumes that fipple and versatile charader, which he observes to be frequent, and which often has appeared to him successful."
"To ihefe, and many more dangers of the fame kind, is the man exposed who is deeply engaged in ative life. No finall degree of  of firmness in religious principle, and of ,__ constancy in virtue, is requisite, in order to prevent his being aflimilated to the spirit of the world, and carried away by the multi."
"tude of evil doers. Let him therefore call to mind those principles which ought to fortify him against such temptations to vice."
"Let him often recollec that, whatever his station in life may be, he is a man; he is a Christian. These are the chief characters which he has to support; characters fuperior far, if they be supported with dignity, to any of the titles with which courts can decorate him; superior to all that can be acquired in the strife of a busy world. Let him think, that though it may be desireable to increase his opulence, or to advance his rank, yet what he ought to hold much more sacred is, to maintain his integrity and honour. If these be forfeited, wealth or station will have few charms left. They will not be able to protect him long from finking into contempt in the eye of an observing world. Even to his own eye he will will at last appear base and wretched.-  Let not the affairs of the world entirely 1V."
"gross his time and thoughts. From that contagious air which he breaths in the midit of it, let him sometimes retreat into the salutary shade consecrated to devotion and to wisdom. There, converting seriously with his own foul, and looking up to the Father of spirits, let him study to calm those unquiet passions, and to redify those internal disorders, which intercourse with the world had excited and increaied. In order to render this medicine of the mind more effectual, it will be highly proper, "
"IV. THAT as we advance in the course of years, we often attend to the lapse of time and life, and to the revolutions which these are ever effecting. In this meditation, one of the first reflections which should occur is, how much we owe to that God who hath hitherto helped us; who hath brought us on so far in life; hath guided BERM. guided us through the slippery paths of 1V. youth, and now enables us to flourifi in the strength of manhood. Look back, my friends, to those who started along with yourselves in the race of life. Think how many of them have fallen around you."
"Observe how many blank spaces you can number in the catalogue of those who were once your companions. If, in the midst of so much devastation, you have been preserved and blessed; confider seriously what returns you owe to the goodness of Heaven. Inquire whether your condua has corresponded to these obligations; whether, in public and in private, you have honoured, as became you, the God of your fathers; and whether, amidfl the unknown occurrences that are yet before you, you have ground to hopl for the continued protection of the Almighty."
"Bring to mind the various revolutions which you have beheld in human affairs, since you became acors on this busy theatre. Refle& on the changes which have taken place in men and manners, in.opinions nions and customs, in private fortunes, and  "
"in public conduct. By the observations _ you have made on these, and the experience you have gained, have you improved proportionably in wisdom ? Have the changes of the world which you have witneffed, loosened all unreasonable attachment to it? Have they taught you this great lesson, that, while the fahion of the world is ever pasing away, only in God and in virtue, stability is to be found ? Of great use, amidst the whirl of the world, are such pauses as these in life; such refting places of thought and reflection; whence we can calmly and deliberately look back on the past, and anticipate the future."
"To the future, we are often casting an eager eye, and fondly storing it, in our imagination, with nany a pleasing scene."
"But if we would look to it, like wife men, let it be under the persuasion that it is nearly to resemble the past, in bringing forward a mixture of alternate hopes and fears, of griefs and joys. In order to be Prepared for whatever it may bring, let us  III. cultivate GE RM. cultivate that manly fortitude of mind, ,_2^ which, supported by a pious trust in God, "
"will enable us to encounter properly the vicissitudes of our tlate. No quality is more necessary than this, to them who are pasing through that stormy season of life of which we now treat. Softness and esfeminacy, let them leave to the young and unexperienced, who are amusing themselves with florid profpeas of bli  But to those who are now engaged in the middle of their course, who are supposed to be well acquainted with the world, and to know that they have to struggle in it with va."
"rious hardIhips, firmness, vigour, and resolution, are dispositions more fuitabie."
"They must buckle on well this armour of the mind, if they would issue forth into the contest with any profpe of success.While we thus study to correC the errors, and to provide againit the dangers, which are peculiar to this stage of life, "
"V, LAY foundation for comfort in old age."
"age. That is a period which all expect and hope to fee; and to which, amidil the toils I_ of the world, men sometimes look forward, not without satisfaction, as to the period of retreat and reft. But let them not deceive themselves. A joyless and dreary season it will prove, if they arrive at it with an unimproved, or corrupted mind. For old age, as for every other thing, a certain preparation is requisite; and that preparation conifts chiefly in three particulars; in the acquisition of knowledge, of friends, of virtue. There is an acquisition of another kind, of which it is altogether needless for me to give any recommendation, that of riches. But though this, by many, will be esteemed a more material acquisition than all the three I have named, it be confidently pronounced, that, without these other requisites, all the wealth we can lay up in store will prove insufficient for making our latter days pais smoothly away."
"First, He who wishes to render his old age comfortable, should iudy betimes to 2 enlarge *"
" enlarge and improve his mind; and by »  thought and inquiry, by reading and reflecing, to acquire a taste for useful knowledge. This will provide for him a great and noble entertainment, when other entertainments leave him. If he bring into the solitary retreat of age a vacant, uninformed mind, where no knowledge dawns, where no ideas rile, which has nothing to feed upon within itself, many a heavy and comfortless day he must necessarily pass.Next, When a man declines into the vale of years, he depends more on the aid of his friends, than in any other period of his life. Then is the time, when he would especially with to find himself surrounded by some who love and respect him; who will bear with his infirmities, relieve him of his labours, and chear him with their society. Let him, therefore, now, in the 'Tummer of his days, while :yet active and fouriihing, by aCs of feafofable kindness and beneficence cnfure that love, and by -upright and honourable conduc lay fountlation for that reflecd, which in old age he 4 he would wiih to enjoy.-In the last place, "
"Let him confider a good conscience, peace ,__ with God, and the hope of heaven, as the molt effectual consolations he can possess, when the eil days thall come, wherein, otherwise, he is likely to find little pleasure. It is not merely by transient ats of devotion that such consolations are to be provided. The regular tenor of a virtuous and pious life, spent in the faithful discharge of all the duties of our ftation, will prove the best preparation for old age, for death, and for immortality."
"AMONG the measures thus taken for the latter scenes of lifei let me admonish every one not to forget to put his worldly affairs in order, in due time. This is a duty which he owes to his characer, to his family, or to those, whoever they be, that are to succeed him; but a duty too often unwisely delayed, from a childilh aversion to entertain any thoughts of quitting the world. Let him not trufi much to what he will do in his old age. Sufficient for  3 that  that day, if he shall live to fee it, will be _,_, the burden thereof. It has been remarked, that as men advance in years, they care less to think of death. Perhaps it occurs oftener to the thoughts of the young, than of the old. Feebleness of' spirit renders melancholy ideas more oppreflive; and after having been so long accustomed and inured to the world, men bear worse with any thing which reminds them that they must soon part with it.-However, as to part with it is the doom of all, let us take measures betimes for going off the flage, when it mhall be our turn to withdraw, with decency and propriety; leaving nothing unfulfilled which it is expedient to have done before we die. To live long, ought not to be our favourite wish, so much as to live well. By continuing too long on earth, we might only live to witness a greater number of melancholy scenes, and to expose ourfclves to a wider compass of human woe. He who has served his generation faithfully in the world, has duly honoured God, and been beneficent and useful useful to mankind; he who in his life has "
"been refpeted and beloved; whose death _ is accompanied with the sincere regret of all who knew him, and whose memory is honoured; that man has sufficiently fulfilled his course, whether it was appointed by Providence to be long or short. For honourable age is not that which flandetb in length of time, nor that which is measured by number of years; but wJfdom is the gray hair to man; and an unspotted life is old age *."

"# SERMON  On DEATH. ECCLESIASTES, xii. 5.  Man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets."
"ECCLESTASTES, Xii. 5."
"- Man goetb to bis long home, and the mourners go about the Jrceets."
"SEVRM. HIS is a fight which incessantly preI ents itself. Our eyes are so much accustomed to it, that it hardly makes any impression. Throughout every season of the year, and during the course of almost every day, the funerals which pals along the streets show us man going to bis long bone. Were death a rare and uncommon objeCt; were it only once in the course of a man life, that he beheld one of his fellow-creatures carried to the grave, a solemn awe awe would fill him; he would flop flort in SERM the midst of luis plcafures; he would even aV be chilled with fecrct horror. Such impref."
"'sions, however, would prove unsuitable to the nature of our preient flare. When they became so strong as to render men unfit for the ordinary business of life, they would in a great measure defeat the intention of our being placed in this world. It is better ordered by thc wisdom of Providence, that they lhould be weakened by the frequency of their recurrence; and so tempered by the mixture of other passions, as to allow us to go on freely in acting our parts on earth."
"Yet, familiar as death is now become, it is undoubtedly fit, that by an event of so important a nature, some imprelion should be made upon our minds. It ought not to pass over, as one of those common incidents which are beheld without concern, and a."
"waken no reflecion. There are many things which the funerals of our fellow-creatures are calculated to teach; and happy it were for the gay and dissipated, if they would liften rE RM. liften mote frequently to the inftrudions of so awful a monitor. In the context, the wife man had described, under a variety of images suited to the eastern style, the growing infirmities of old age, until they arrive it that period which concludes them all; when, as he beautifully expresses it, the filver cord being loosened, and the golden bowl broken, the pitcher being broken at the fountain, and the wheel at the cistern, man goeth to bis long home, and the mourners go about tbeJreett. In discoursing from these words, it is not my purpose to treat, at present, of the infiruaiona to be drawn from the prosped of our own death. I am to confine myself to the death of others; to confider death as one of the molt frequent and confiderable events that happen in the course of human: affairs; and to show in what manner.we ought to be affected, first, by the death of firangers, or indifferent persons; secondly, by the death of friends; and thirdly, by the death of enemies."
"I. BY the death of indifferent persons; "
"if if any can be called indifferent, to whom ."
"we are so nearly allied as brethren by nature, and brethren in mortality. When we observe the funerals that pars along the streets, or when we walk among the monuments of death, the first thing that naturally strikes us is the undiftinguifhing blow, with which that common enemy levels all. We behold a great promiscuous multitude all carried to the fame abode; all lodged in the fame dark and silent mansions. There, mingle persons of every age and character, of every rank and condition in life; the young and the old, the poor and the rich, the gay and the grave, the renowned and the ignoble. A few weeks ago, most of those whom we have seen carried to the grave, walked about as we do now on the earth; enjoyed their friends, beheld the light of the fun, and were forming designs for future days. Perhaps, it is not long since they were engaged in scenes of high festivity. For them, perhaps, the cheerful company assembled; and in the midst of the circle they shone with gay and pleasing  pleasing vivacity. But now-to them, all is ' finally closed. To them, no more flall the seasons return, or the fun arise. No more ihall thcy hear the voice of mirth, or behold the face of man. They are swept from the univcrfe, as though they had never been."
"They are carried away as with a flood: The wind has paged over them, and they are gone."
"When we contemplate this desolation of the human race; this final termination of fb many hopes; this silence that now reigns among those who, a little while ago, were to busy, or so gay; who can avoid being xouched with sensations at once awful and tender i What heart but then warms with the glow of humanity ? In whose eye does not the tear gather, on revolving the fate of passing and ihortlived man ? Such sensations are so congenial to human nature, that they are attended with a certain kind of sorrowful pleasure. Even voluptuaries themselves, sometimes indulge a taste for funereal melancholy. After the festive assembly is difmifTld, they chufe to walk retired in the shady grove, and to contemplate the venerable fcpulchrcs of their ancestors. This melancholy melancholy pleasure arises from two differ- "
"ent sentiments meeting at the fame time in  the breast; a sympathetic sense of the shortness and vanity of life, and a persuasion that something exists after death; sentiments, which unite at the view of the honfe appointed for all living. A tomb, it has been justly said, is a monument situated on the confines of both worlds. It, at once, presents to us the termination of the inquietudes of life, and sets before us the image of eternal reft bere, in the elegant expressions of Job, the wicked ce.fe from troubling; and there the weary be at ref. There the prisoners ref together; they hear not the voice ofthe opprefor. Thefmall and the great are there; and the servant is free from his mafler. It is very remarkable, that in all languages, and among all nations, death has been described in a style of this kind; expressed by figures of speech, which convey every where the fame idea of reft, or sleep, or retreat from the evils of life. Such a style perfestly agrees with the general belief of the foul inSmortality; but assuredly . conveys  conveys no high idea of the boasted pleaV. fures of the world. It. hows how much all mankind have felt this life to be a fccne of trouble and care; and have agreed in opinion, that perfect reft is to be expected only in the grave."
"There, fays Job, are the finall and the great. There, the poor man lays down at lat the burden of hiswearifome life. No more shall he groan under the load of poverty and toil. No more fall he hear the insolent calls of the master, from whom he received his scanty wages. No more shall he be raised from needful number on his bed of straw, nor be hurried away from his homely meal, to undergo the repeated labours of the day. While his humble grave is preparing, and a few poor and decayed neighbours are carrying him thither, it is good for us to think, that this man too was our brother; that for him the aged and deftitute wife, and the needy children now weep; that, neglected as he was by the world, he possessed perhaps both a found understanding, and a worthy heart; and is now now carried by angels to reft in Abraham "
"bofom.-At no great distance from him, the . grave is opened to receive the rich and proud man. For, as it is said with emphasis in the parable, the rich man al died, and war buried*. He a died. His riches prevented not his sharing the fame fate with the poor man; perhaps, through luxury, they accelerated his doom. Then, indeed, the mourners go about the Jreets; and while, in all the pomp and magnificence of woe, his funeral is prepared, his heirs, in the mean time, impatient to examine his will, are looking on one another with jealous eyes, and already beginning to quarrel about the division of his fubftance.-One day, we fee carried along the coffin of the frniling infant; the flower just nipped as it began to blossom in the parents view: and the next day, we behold the young man, or young woman, of blooming form and promising hopes, laid in an untimely grave. While the funeral is attended by a numerous, unconcerned  concerned company, who are discoursing  to one another about the news of the day, "
"or the ordinary affairs of life, let our thoughts rather follow to the house of mourning, and represent to themselves what is going on there. There, we would fee a disconsolate family, fitting in silent grief, thinking of the fad breach that is made in their little society; and, with tears in their eyes, looking to the chamber that is now left vacant, and to every memorial that presents itself of their departed friend. By such attention to the woes of others, the selfish hardness of our hearts will be gradually softened, and melted down into humanity."
"Another day, we follow to the grave one who, in old age, and after a long career of life, has in full maturity funk at last into reft. As we are going along to the mansion of the dead, it is natural for us to think, and to discourse, of all the changes which such a person has seen during the course of his life. He has pafled, it is likely, through varieties of fortune. He has has experienced prosperity, and adversity. "
"He has seen families and kindreds rife and fall. He has seen peace and war succeeding in their turns; the face of his country undergoing many alterations; and the very city in which he dwelt riling, in a manner, new around him. After all he has beheld, his eyes are now closed for ever."
"He was becoming a stranger in the midst of a new fucceflion of men. A race who knew him not, had arisen to fill the earth."
"Thus passes the world away. Throughout all ranks and conditions, one generation passeth, and another generation cometh; and this great inn is by turns evacuated, and replenished, by troops of succeeding pilgrims."
"--0 vain and inconflant world! 0 fleeting and transient life ! When will die sons of men learn to think of thee, as they ought? When will they learn humanity from the aflictions of their brethren; or moderation and wisdom, from the sense of their own fugitive state ?-But, now to come nearer to ourselves, let us, "
"VOL. III.  CON  CONSIDER the death of our friends."
"V. Want of reflection, or the long habits, either of a very busy, or a very dissipated life, may have rendered men insensible to all such objects as I have now described. The firanger, and the unknown, fall utterly unnoticed at their  Life proceeds with them in its usual train, without being asfe by events in which they take no personal concern. But the dissolution of those ties which had long bound men together, in intimate and familiar union, gives a painful thock to every heart. When a family, who, for years, had been living in comfort and peace, are suddenly flattered by some of their most beloved or refpe members being torn from them; when the hutband or the spouse are separated for ever from the companion who, amidst every viciflitude of fortune, solaced their life; ho had ihared all their joys, and participated in all their lorrows; when the weeping parent is folding in his arms the dying !:lid whom he tenderly loved; when he is giving his laht blessing, receiving the last lat fond adieu, looking for the last time SE "
"on that countenance, now wafting and fa- .ded, which he had once beheld with much delight; then is the time, when the heart is made to drink all the bitterness of human woe.-But I seek not to wound your feelings by dwelling on there fad defcrip."
"rions. Let us rather turn our thoughts to the manner in which such events ought to be received and improved, since happen they mult in the life of man."
"Then, indeed, is the time to weep. Let not a false idea of fortitude, or mistaken conceptions of religious duty, be employed to restrain the bursting emotion. Let the heart seek its relief, in the free effusion of just and natural sorrow. It is becoming in every one to show, on such occasions, that he feels, as a man ought to feel. At the fame time, let moderation temper the grief of a good man and a Christian. He mull not sorrow like tbofe who have no bhpe. As high elation of spirits befits not the joys, so continued and overwhelming dejection suits not the griefs of this tranitory world."
"E RM. Grief, when it goes beyond certain bounds, , becomes unmanly; when it lasts beyond a certain time, becomes unseasonable. Let him not reject the alleviation which time brings to all the wounds of the heart, but susser excessive grief to subside, by degrees, into a tender and affectionate remembrance. Let him confider, that it is in the power of Providence to raise him up other comforts in the place of those he has loft."
"Or, if his mind, at present, rejed the thoughts of fuicY consolation, let it turn for relief to the profpet of a future meeting in a happier world. This is indeed the chief soother of affliction; the most powerful balm of the bleeding heart. It affilts us to view death, as no more than a temporary separation of friends. They whom we have loved still live, though not present to us. They are only removed into a different mansion in the house of the common Father. The toils of their pilgrimage are finished; and they are gone to the land of reft and peace. They are gone from this dark and troubled world, "
"to to join the great aflcmbly of the just; and to dwell in the midst of everlasting light. _, In due time we hope to be associated with them in these blissful habitations. Until this season of re-union arrive, no principle of religion discourages our holding corre1pondence of affecion with them by means of faith and hope."
"Meanwhile, let us refpec the virtues, "
"and cherifl the memory, of the deceased."
"Let their little failings be now forgotten."
"Let us dwell on what waiamiable in their charater, imitate their worth, and trace their steps. By this means, the remembrance of those whom we loved shall become useful and improving to us, as well as sacred and dear; if we accustom ourselves to confider them as Rill speaking, and exhorting us to all that is good; if, in situations where our virtue is tried, we call up their refpe'ted idea to view, and, as placed in their presence, think of the part which we could ac before them without a blush."
"Moreover, let the remembrance of the 3 friends  friends whom we have loft, strengthen our  affection to those that remain. The narrower the circle becomes of those we love, let us draw the closer together. Let the heart that has been softened by sorrow, mellow into gentleness and kindness; make liberal allowance for the weaknesses of others; and divest itself of the little prejudices that may have formerly prepossessed it against them. The greater havock that death has made among our friends on earth, let us cultivate connecion more with God, and heaven, and virtue. Let those noble views which man immortal charaCter affords, fill and exalt our minds."
"Passengers only through this sublunary region, let our thoughts often ascend to that divine country, which we are taught to confider as the native feat of the foul."
"Thcre, we form conneCtions that are never broken. There, we meet with friends who never die. Among celestial things there is firm and lasting constancy, while all that is on earth changes and passes away.- Such are some of the fruits we should {hould reap from the tender feelings ex- "
"cited by the death of friends. But they  are not only our friends who die. Our enemies also must go to their long home."
"Let us, therefore, "
"III. CONSIDER how we ought to be asfe  when they from whom fulpicions have alienated, or rivalry has divided us; they with whom we have long contended, or by whom we imagine ourselves to have suffered wrong, are laid, or about to be laid, in the grave. How inconsiderable then appear those broils in which we had been long involved, those contefis and feuds which we thought were to last for ever ? The awful moment that now terminates them, makes us feel their vanity."
"If there be a spark of humanity left in the breast, the remembrance of our common fate then awakens it. Is there a man, who, if he were admitted to stand by the deathbed of his bitterest enemy, and beheld him enduring that conflic which human nature muf fuiffer at the last, would not be 4 inclini '"

Because topics of this nature are obvious, let it not be thought that they are without use. They require to be recalled, repeated, and enforced. Moral and religious inftrusion derives its efficacy, not so much from what men are taught to know, as from what they are brought to feel. It is not the dormant knowledge of any truths,. but the vivid impreflion of them, which has influence on practice."
"Neither let it be thought, that such meditations are unseasonable intrusions upon those who are living in health, in affluence, and ease. There is no hazard of their making too deep or painful an impression. The gloom which they occasion is transient; and will soon, too soon, it is probable, be difpelled by the succeeding affairs and pleafurcs of the world. To wisdom it certainly belongs, that men should be impresscd with just views of their nature, and their state: and the pleasures of life will always be be enjoyed to most advantage when they are tempered with serious thought.

"SERFR. HOUGH human nature be now fallen lT_ .
1 from its original honour, several good principles still remain in the hearts of men.
There are few, if any, on whose minds the reverence for a Supreme Being continues not, in some degree, impressed. In every breast, some benevolent affetions are found; and confciencc still retains a sense of the liftindion between moral good and evil.
These principles of virtue are always susceptible of improvement; and, in favourable able situations, might have a happy 
fluence on praceice. But filch is the frail- __ ty of our nature, and so numerous are the temptations to evil, that they are in perpetual hazard of being either totally effaced, or so far weakened as to produce no effect on conducd. They are good feeds originally sown in the heart; but which require culture, in order to make them rife to any maturity. If left without afliftance, they are likely to be stifled by that profusion of noxious weeds which the foil fends forth around them.

Among the numerous causes which introduce corruption into the heart, and accelerate its growth, none is more unhappily powerful than that which is pointed out in the text, under the description of evil communications; that is, the contagion which is diffused by bad examples, and heightened by particular connections with persons of loose principles, or dissolute morals. This, in a licentious slate of society, is the most common source of those vices and disorders which so much abound in great cities; 
and aE  and often proves, in particular manner, fa_ tal to the young; even to them whose beginnings were once auspicious and promising. It may therefore be an useful employment of attention, to trace the progreif of this principle of corruption; to examine the means by which evil communications gradually undermine, and at last destroy good manners, or (which here is the proper fignification of the original word) goad morals.
It is indeed disagreeable to contemplate human nature, in this downward course of its progress. But it is always profitable to know our own infirmities and dangers.
The consideration of them will lead me to suggest some of the means proper to be ufed, for preventing the mischiefs arising from evil communications.

AGREEABLY to what I observed of certain virtuous principles being inherent in human nature, there are few but who set out at first on the world with good difpofitions. The warmth which belongs to youth naturally exerts itself in generous feelings, 
and and sentiments of honour; in firong at- 


tachment to friends, and the other emo- _, tions of a kind and tender heart. Almost all the plans with which persons who have been liberally educated begin the world, are connected with honourable views. At that period, they repudiate whatever is mean or base. It is pleasing to them to think, of commanding the esteem of those among whom they live, and of acquiring a name among men. But alas! how soon does this flattering prafp begin to be overcast!
Desires of pleafire usher in temptation, and forward the growth of disorderly paflions.
Nlinifters of vice are seldom wanting to encourage, and flatter, the palfions of the young. Inferiors study to creep into favour, by servile obfequioufnefi to all their desires and humours. Glad to find any apology for the indulgences of which they are fond, the young too readily liften to the voice of those who suggest to them, that ftricl notions of religion, order, and virtue, are old faihioned and illiberal; that the restraints which they impose are only fit  fit to be prescribed to those who are in the  first stage of pupillage; or to be preached to the vulgar, who ought to be kept within the closest bounds of regularity and subjection. But the goodness of their hearts, it is insinuated to them, and the liberality of their views, will fully justify their emancipating themselves, in some degree, from the rigid discipline of parents and teachers.

Soothing as such infmuations are to the youthful, and inconsiderate, their first steps, however, in vice, are cautious and timid, and occasionally checked by remorse. As they begin to mingle more in the world, and emerge into the circles of gaiety and pleasure, finding these loose ideas countenanced by too general pratice, they gradually become bolder in the liberties they take. If they have been bred to business, they begin to tire of industry, and look with contempt on the plodding race of citizens. If they be of superior rank, they think it becomes them to resemble their equals; to assume that freedom of behaviour, that air of forwardness, that tone of dissipation, 
dissipation, that easy negligence of those with whom they converse, which appear ,1.
faihionable in high life. If affluence of fortune unhappily concur to favour their inclinations, amusements and diversions succeed in a perpetual round; night and day are confounded; gaming fills up their vacant intervals; they live wholly in public places; they run into many degrees of excess, disagreeable even to themselves, merely from weak complaisance, and the fear of being ridiculed by their loose associates.
Among these associates, the most hardened and determined always take the lead. The reft follow them with implicit submission; and make proficiency in this school of iniquity, in exa& proportion to the weakness of their understandings, and the strength of their passions.

How many pais away, after this manner, 
some of the most valuable years of their life, toft in a whirlpool of what cannot be called pleasure, so much as mere giddinefi and folly ? In the habits of perpetual connection with idle or licentious company,   III. I all  all reflection is loft; while, circulated fromt Vl.
 one empty head, and one thoughtlefit heart, 
to another, folly shoots up into all its molt ridiculous forms; prompts the extravagant, unmeaning frolic in private; or sallies forth in public into mad riot; impelled sometimes by intoxication, sometimes by mere levity of spirits..

All the while, amidst this whole course of juvenile infatuation, I readily admit, that much good nature may fill remain. Generofity and attachments may be found; nay, some awe of religion may lill subsist, and fime remains of those good imprefflons which were made upon the mind in early days. It might yet be very poflible to rcclaim such persons, and to form them for useful and refpecable flations in the world, if virtuous and improving focicty lhould happily 'ucceed to the place of that idle crew with whom they now associate; if important bufmefs should occur, to bring them into a different sphere of acion; or, if some fealbnable stroke of afflition should in mercy be sent, to recall them to themcelves, and to awaken fcrioui annl manly seReM.
thought. But, if youth and vigour, and _.
flowing fortune continue; if a similar sicceflion of companions go on to ainmfe them, to ingrofs their time, and to Flir up their passions; the day of ruin,-lct them take heed, and beware !-the day of irrecoverable ruin, begins to draw nigh. Fortune is squandered; health is broken; friends are offended, affronted, ellranged; aged parents, perhaps, sent afflicted and mourning, to the dust.

There are certain degrees of vice which arc chiefly stamped with the characer of the ridiculous, and the contemptible: and there are also certain limits, beyond which if it pass, it becomes odious and execrable. If, to other corruptions which the heart has already received, be added the infusion of sceptical principles, that worst of all the evil communicationm of finners, the whole of morals is then on the point of being overthrown. For, every crime can then be palliated to conscience; every'check and restraint which had hitherto remained, 
1 2 is  is taken away. He who, in the beginning _1 _ of his courte, soothed himself with the thought, that while he indulged his defires, he did hurt to no man; now, pressed by the neceflity of supplying those wants into which his expensive pleasures have brought him, goes on without remorse to defraud, and to oppress. The lover of pleasure, now becomes hardened and cruel; violates his trust, or betrays his friend; becomes a man of treachery, or a man of blood; satisfying, or at least endeavouring all the while to satisfy himfeif, that circumstances form his excuse; that by necessity he is impelled; and that, in gratifying the passions which nature had implanted within him, he does no more than follow nature.

Miserable and deluded man! to wi. art thou come at the last? Dost thou pretend to follow nature, when thou art contemning the laws of the God of nature?
when thou art Itifling his voice within thee, which remonltrates against thy crimes?
when thou art violating the belt part of thy nature, by counteracing the dicates of of justice and humanity? Dost thou fol- 
low nature, when thou rendereft thyself an _1 useless animal on the earth; and not useless only, but noxious to the society to which thou belongeft, and to which thou art a disgrace; noxious, by the bad example thou haft set; noxious, by the crimes thou haft committed; sacrificing innocence to thy guilty pleasures, and introducing flame and ruin into the habitations of peace; defrauding of their due the unfufpicious who have trusted thee; involving in the ruins of thy fortune many a worthy family; reducing the industrious and the aged to misery and want; by all which, if thou haft escaped the deserved sword ofjuftice, thou halt at least brought on thylelf the resentment, and the reproach of all the respectable and the worthy.-Tremble then at the view of the gulph which is opening before thee. Look with horror at the precipice, on the brink of which thou standeft: and if yet a moment be left for rctreat, think how thou mayst escape, and be saved.

I 3 Tils  Tins brings me to what I proposed 

- as the next head of discourse; to suggest some means that may be used for stopping in time the progress of such mischiefs; to point out some remedies against the fatal infection of evil communications.

THE first and most obvious is, to withdraw from all associations with bad men, with persons either of licentious principles, or of disorderly condut. I have shown to what ifue such dangerous connections are apt to bring men at lat. Nothing, therefore, is of more importance for the young, to whom I now chiefly address myself, than to be careful in the choice of their friends and companions. This choice is too frequently made without much thought, or is determined by some casual connection; and yet, very often, the whole fate of their future life depends upon it. The circumstances which chiefly attract the liking and the friendship of youth, are vivacity, good humour, engaging manners, and a cheerful or easy temper; qualities, I confess, ariabible miable in themselves, and useful and va- 


luable in their place. But I intreat you to , remember, that there are not all the qualities requisite to form an intimate companion or friend. Something more is still to he looked for; a found understanding, a steady mind, a firm attachment to principle, to virtue, and honour. As only solid bodies polish well, it is only on the subftantial ground of these manly endowments, that the other amiable qualities can receive their proper lustre. Destitute of these esfential requisites, they ihine with no more than a tinsel brilliancy. It may sparkle for a little, amidst a few circles of the frivolous, and superficial; but it imposes not on the discernment of the public. The world in general seldom, after a short trial, judges amiss of the characers of men. You may be assured, that its charater of you will be formed by the company you frequent; and how agreeable soever they may ieem to be, if nothing is to be found among them but hollow qualities, and external accomplifmments, they soon fall down into the class, 
I 4 at  at best, of the insignificant, perhaps of the .' worthless; and you fink of course, in the opinion of the public, into the fame defpicable rank.

Allow me to warn you, that the most gay and pleasing, are sometimes the most insidious and dangerous companions; an admonition which refpeds both the sexes.
Often they attach themselves to you from interested motives; and if any taint or fufpicion lie on their characer, under the cover of your rank, your fortune, or your good reputation, they seek protection for themselves. Look round you, then, with attentive eye, and weigh characters well before you conned yourselves too closely with any who court your society. He that walketb with wife men a/ll be wis ; but a companion of fools Jball be deflrored. Wherefore, enter not thou into the counsel of the scorner. Walk not in the way with evil men; avoid it; pafi not by it, turn from it, and pass away *.

*Prov. xiii. 20.; Prov . . 14.

IN IN order to prevent the influence of evil 
communications, it is farther needful, that aj_ you fix to yourselves certain principles of conduct, and be resolvcd and determined on no occasion to swerve from them. Setting the consideration of religion and virtue aside, and attending merely to interest and reputation, it will be found, that he who enters on active life without having ascertained some regular plan, according to which he is to guide himself, will be unprosperous in the whole of his subsequent progress. But when conduct is viewed in a moral and religious light, the effeft of having fixed no principles of action; of having formed no laudable standard of character, becomes more obviously fatal'
For hence it is, that the young and thoughtless imbibe so readily the poison of evil communications, and fall a prey to every feducer. They have no internal guide whom they are accustomed to follow and obey; nothing within themselves, that can give firmness to their condu They are of course the vicims of momentary inclination or caprice;    caprice ; religious and good by flarts, 
., when, during the absence of temptation and tempters, the virtuous principle stirs within them ; but never long the fame; changing and fluctuating according to the passion that chances to rife, or the inftigation of thole with whom they have connected themfclves. They are failing on a dangerous sea, which abounds with rocks; without compass, by which to direct their course, or helm, by which to guide the veffel. Whereas, if they acted on a system, if their behaviour made it appear that they were determined to conduct themselves by certain rules and principles, not only would they escape innumerable dangers, but they would command reljied from the licentious themfelvcs. Evil doers would cease to lay their fiares for one whom they saw moving above them, in a higher iphere, and with a more steady course.

As a farther corrective of evil communications, and as a foundation to those principles which you lay down for conduct, 
let let me advise you sometimes to think fe- 


rioufly, of what contlitutes real enjoyment _ and happiness. Your days cannot be entirely spent in company and pleasure.
How closely soever you are surrounded and besieged by evil companions, there must be some intervals, in which you are left by yourselves; when, after all the turbulence of amusement is over, your mind will naturally assume a graver and more pensive cast These are precious intervals to you, if you knew their value. Seize that fober hour of retirement and silence. Indulge the meditations which then begin to rife.
Cast your eye backwards on what is past of your life; look forward to what is probably to come. Think of the part you are now acting; and of what remains to be ated, perhaps to be suffered, before you die. Then is the time to form your plans of happiness, not merely for the next day, but for the general course of your life.
Remember, that what is pleasing to you at twenty, will not be equally so at forty or fifty years of age; and that what continues longef  longest pleasing, is always most valuable. a Recolled your own feelings in different fcenep of life. Inquire on what occasions you have felt the truest fatisfalion; whether days of sobriety, and rational employment, have not left behind them a more agreeable remembrance, than nights of licentioueiefs and riot. Look round you on the world; reflec on the different focieties which have fallen under your obfervation; and think who among them appear to enjoy life to most advantage; whether they who, encircled by gay companions, are constantly fatiguing themselves in quest of pleasure; or they to whom pleasure comes unsought, in the course of an ative, virtuous, and manly life. Compare together these two claffcs of mankind, and aik your own hearts, to which of them you would chufe to belong. If, in a happy moment, the light of truth begin to break in upon you, refuse not admittance to the ray. If your hearts lecretly reproach you for the wrong choice you have made, bethink yourselves that the evil is not not irreparable Srill llerc is time for 
pentance and retreat; and a return to wis- dom, is always honourable.

Were such meditations often indulged, 
the evil comalnications of finners would die away before the i; the force of their poison would evaporate; the world would begin to assume in your eyes a new form and shape. Disdain not, in these solitary hours, to recolled what the wisest have lsid, and have written, concerning human happincfs, and humarn vanity. Treat not theit opinions, as effusions merely of peeviihnefs or disappointment: but believe theni to be, What they truly are, the result of long experience, and thorough acquaintmace with the world. Confider that the leafon of youth is passing fait away. It is time for you to be taking measures for an establishment in life; nay, it were wife to be looking forward to a placid enjoyment of old age. That is a period you wish to fee; but how miserable when it arrives, if it yield you nothing but the dregs of life; and present no retrdfped, 
except  except that of a thoughtless, and difioVL__ noured youth!

LET me once more advise you, to look forward sometimes beyond old age; to look to a future world. Amidst evil communications, let your belief, and your character as Christians, arise to your view. Think of the sacred name in which you were baptized. Think of the God whom your fathers honoured and worihipped; of the religion in which they trained you up; of the venerable rites in which they brought you to partake. Their paternal cares have now ceased. They have finished their earthly course: and the time is coming when you must follow them. You know that you are not to live always here; and you surely do not believe that your existence is to end with this life. Into what world then are you next to go ? Whom will you meet with there ? Before whose tribunal are you to appear ? What account will you be able to give of your present trifling and irregular conduCt to him who made made you ?-Such thoughts may be treat-  as unseasonable intrusions. But intrude 
they sometimes will, whether you make them welcome or not. Better then, to allow them free reception when they come, and to confider fairly to what they lead.
You have seen persons die; at least, you have heard of your friends dying near you.
Did it never enter into your minds, to think what their last reflections probably were in their concluding moments; or what your own, in such a situation, would be ? What would be then your hopes and fears; what part you would then wish to have acted; in what light your closing eyes would then view this life, and this world ?

These are thoughts, my friends, too important to be always excluded. These are things too solemn and awful to be trifled with. They are superior to all the ridicule of fools. They come home to every man bosom; and are intitled to every man highest attention. Let us regard them as becomes reasonable and mortal creatures; 
and . and they will prove effectual antidotes to ^ the evil communications of petulant scoffers."
"When vice or folly arise to tempt us under flattering forms, let the serious character which we bear as men come also forward to view; and let the solemn admonitions, with which I conclude, found full in our ears: My Jon, if inners entice thee, consent tbou not. Come out from amongj)"

"In this situation, no quality is more requifite than constancy, or fortitude of mind; a quality which the Psalmist appears, from the sentiment in the text, to have pofirfcfe in an eminent degree. Fortitude was justly classed by the ancient philosophers, among the cardinal virtues."
"It is indeed essential to the support of them all; and is molt necessary to be acquired by every one who wifles to discharge with fidelity the duties of his tation. It is the armour of the mind, which will fit hin for encountering the trials, and surmounting the dangers, that are likely to occur in the course of his life. It may be thought, "

Though, partly, it is io, vet experience ihows that it may also be acquired by principle, and be fortified by realbn ; and it is only when thuls acquired, and thus fortitied, at it can be accounted to carry the characer of virtue. Fortitude is opposcd, as all know, to timidity, ilrcliolution, a feeble and a wavering spirit. It is placed, like other virtues, in the middle between two cxtrcmes ; tanding at an equal diltance from rallnelc on the one hand, and from puiillanimity on the other. In difiourfing on this fuljeict, I purlpolc, firl, to flow the importance of fortitude or conflancv; next, to afccrtain the grounds on which it mult reft; and, latl  to fuiggif ioime confidera tions for affiffing the exercile of it."
"I. THIE high importance of fortitude will cafily appear, if we coniider it as refpeting either the happinels of human life, or the proper :!ifch:rge of its dutics."
"K 2 Without  Without some degree of fortitude there ,VL. can be no happincs  bccanfe, amridft the thousand uncertainties of life, there can be no enjoyment of tranquillity. The man of feeble and timorous spirit, lives under perpetual alarms. He foresees every distant danger, and trembles. He explores the regions of pofTibility, to discover the dangers that may arilc. Often lie creates imaginary ones; always magnifies those that are real."
"Hence, like a person haunted by speares, he loies the free enjoyment even of a fife and 1rofpcrous tate. On the firflt hock of adversity, he dcifonds. Inltead of exerting himself to lay hold on the resources that remain, he gives up all for loft; and resigns himfclf to abject and broken spirits."
"-On the other hand, firmness of mind is the parent of tranquillity. It enables one to enjoy the prelent without dilturbance; and to look calmly on dangers that approach, or evils that threaten in future. It fuggeits good hopes. It supplies resources."
"It allows a man to retain the full poffefiion of himself, in every situation of fortune."
"Look into the heart of this man, and you will will find compofiure, cheerfulness, and mag- SS. RM."
"nanimity. Look into the heart of the other, "
"and you will fee nothing but confusion, anxiety, and trepidation. The one is the cattle built on a rock, which defies the attacks of surrounding waters. The other is a hut placed on the shore, which every wind lhakes, and every wave overflows."
"IF fortitude be thus essential to the enjoyment of life, it is equally so, to the proper diTcharge of all its most important duties."
"He who is of a cowardly mind is, and must be, a slave to the world. He fashions his whole conduc according to its hopes and fears. He smiles, and fawns, and betrays, from abjec considerations of personal safety. He is incapable of either conceiving, or executing, any great design. He can neither fland the clamour of the multitude, nor the frowns of the mighty. The wind of popular favour, or the threats of power, are sufficient to {hake his molt determined purpose. The world always knows where to find him. He may pretend 3 to  to have prinlciplcs; blit on every trying ocL^^_ claionl, it will he lCeen, that his pretended principles Iendl to convenience and fafcty."
"-hTc man of virtuous fortitude, again, follows the dictatcs of his heart, uncmbarrafled by those restraints which lie upon the timorous. I laving once detcrmined what is fit for him to do, no threatenings can flake, nor dangcrs appall him. He rclts upon himself, fipported by a conIcioulcfis of inward dignity.

After having long aaed as the apostle of the Gentiles, his miflion called him to go to Jerusalem, where he knew that he was to encounter the utmost violence of his enemies. Just before he set fail, he called together the elders of his favourite church at Ephesus, and in a pathetic speech, which does great honour to his characer, gave them his last farewel."

",pend its shafts in vain. All is found "
"within. There is no weak place, where we particularly dread a blow. There is no occalion for false colours to be hung out."
"No disguise is needed to cover us. We would be satisfied if all mankind could look into our hearts. What has he to fear, who not only ats on a plan which his conscience approves, but who knows that every good man, nay, the whole unbialfed world, if they could trace his intentions, would justify and approve his condut ?"
"1H knows, at the fame time, that he is ading under the immediate eye and protection of the Almighty. Behold my witness is in ceaven ; and my record is on high *. Here opens a new source of fortitude to every virtuous man. The consciousness of such an illutrious fpedator, invigorates and alimates him. He trults, that the eternal lover  ver of righteousness not only beholds and "
"a__ approves, but will strengthen and assist; "
"will not susser him to be unjustly oppressed, and will reward his constancy in the end, with glory, honour, and immortality. A good conscience, thus supported, bestows on the heart a much greater degree of intrepidity, than it could otherwise inspire. One who reils on an Almighty, though invisible, Protector, exerts his powers with double force; ads with vigour not his own. Accordingly, it was from this principle of trust in God, that the Psalmist derived that courage and boldness, which he expresses in the text. He had said immediately before, The Lord is my light and my salvation; the Lord it the Jretigth of my life. The consequence which diredly follows is, of whom jhall I be afraid ? Though an hoJt Jhould encamp againt me, my heart Jhall not frar. It remains, "
"III. THAT I fuggedt a few considerations which may prove auxiliary to the exercise of of virtuous fortitude, in the midst of dan- "
"gers. From what was just now said, it appears, "
"first, that it is of high importance to every one who wifles to aa his part with "
"coming resolution, to cultivate a religious principle, and to be inspired with trust in God. The imperfections of the best are indeed so numerous, as to give them no title to claim, on their own account, the protection of Heaven. But we are taught to believe, that the merciful God, who made us, and who knows our frame, favours the sincere and upright; that the supreme administration of the universe is always on the of truth and virtue; and, that, therefore, every worthy character, and every just and good cause, though for a while it mhould be depressed, is likely to receive countenance and proteCtion in the end."
"The more firmly this belief is rooted in the heart, its influence will be more powerful, in surmounting the fears which arise from a sense of our own weakness or danger. The records of all nations afford a thousand  thousand remarkable initances of the es. fed of this principle, both on individuals, "
"and on bodies of men. Animated by the strong belief of a just cause, and a protcding God, the feeble have waxed Jlrong, and have despised dangers, sufferings, and death. Handfuls of men have defied bojis that were encamped agaitql them ; and have gone forth, conquering and to conquer. The fuword of the Lord, and of Gideon, have called forth a valour which afionifhed the world; and which could have been exerted by none, but those who fought under a divine banner."
"IN the next place, let him who would preserve fortitude in difficult situations, fill his mind with a sense, of what constitutes the true honour of man. It consists not in the multitude of riches, or the elevation of rank; for experience Ihows, that these may be possessed by the worthless, as well as by the deserving. It consists, in being deterred by no danger when duty calls us forth; in fulfilling our allotted part, whatever it may be, "
"be, with faithfulness, bravery, and "
"ftancy of mind. These qualities never fail ."
"to stamp diftilnction on the character. They confer on him who discovers them, an honourable fuperlority, which all, even enemies, feel and revere. Let every man, therefore, when the hour of danger comes, bethink himself, that now is arrived the hour of trial; the hour which must determine whether he is to rife, or to fink for ever, in the eftcem of all around him. If, when put to the test, he discover no firmness to maintain his ground, no fortitude to stand a flock, he has forfeited every pretension to a manly mind. He mull reckon on being exposed to general contempt; and what is worse, he will feel that he deserves it. In his own eves he will be contemptible; than which, lurely, no mifery can be more severe."
"BUT in order to acquire habits of fortitude, what is of the highest consequence is, to have formed a just estimate of the goods and evils of life, and of the value of life BERM. life itself. For here lies the chief Iburce of »^_^ our weakness and pusillanimity. We overvalue the advantages of fortune; rank and riches, cafe and iifety. Deluded by vain opinions, we look to theye as our ultimate goods. We hang upon them with fond attachment; and to forfeit any hope of ancement, to incur the least discredit with the world, or to be brought down but one ftep from the fiation we possess, is regarded with consternation and dismay. Hence, a thousand weights hang upon the mind, which depress its courage, and bend it to mean and diflionourable compliances. What fortitude can he poffels, what worthy or generous purpose can he form, who conceives diminution of rank, or loss of fortune, to be the chief evils which man can susser? Put these into the balance with true honour, with conscious integrity, with the esteem of the virtuous and the wife, with the favour of Almighty God, with peace of mind, and hope of heaven; and then think, whether those dreaded evils are sufficient to intimidate you from doing your your duty. Look beyond external appear- "
"ances to the inside of things. Suffer not _ yourselves to be impoied by that glittering varnish, with which the surface of the world dazzles the vulgar. Confider how many are contented and happy without those advantages of fortune, on which you put so extravagant a value. Confider whether it is poifible for you to be happy with them, if, for their fake, you forfeit all that is effimabe in man. The favour of the great, perhaps, you think, is at flake; or that popularity with the multitude, on which you build plans of advancement."
"Alas! how precarious are the means which you employ in order to attain the end you have in view; and the end itself, how little is it worthy of your ambition ? That fa~"
"your which you pursue, of dubious advantage when gained, is frequently loft by servile compliance. The timid and abjeA are deteted, and despised even by those whom they court; while the firm and resolute rife in the end to those honours%"
"which the other pursued in vain."
" PUT the cafe at the wori. Suppose not _.~.2. your fortune only, but your safety, to be in hazard; your life itself to be endangered, by adhering to conscience and virtue. Think, what a creeping and ignominious state you would render life, if, when your duty calls, you would expose it to no danger; if by a dastardly behaviour, you would, at any expence, preserve it."
"That life, which you are so anxious to preserve, can at any rate be prolonged only for a few years more; and those years may be full of woe. He who will not rilk death when conscience requires him to face it, ought to be aihamed to live.- Confider, as a man and a Christian, for what purpose life was given thee by Heaven. Was it, that thou mighteft pass a few years in low pleasures, and ignoble sloth; flying into every corner to hide thyself, when the least danger rifes to view ? No: Life was given, that thou mighteft come forth to some useful and honourable part, on that theatre where thou haft been placed by Providence; mighteft glorify him that made thee; "
"thee; and by steady perseverance in virtue, "
"rife in the end to an immortal state. ,_ Son of man! Remember thine original honours. Aflert the dignity of thy nature."
"Shake off this pusillanimous dread of death; and seek to fulfil the ends for which thou wert sent forth by thy Creator.--The sentiment of a noble mind is, Icount not my life dear unto miyef, Jo that I may fini#"
"my courfi with joy. To the fini/bing of bi course, let every one direc his eye; and let him now appretiate life according to the value it will be found to have, when fummed up at the close. That is the period which brings every thing to the tet. Illusions may formerly have imposed on the world; may have imposed on the man himself. But all illusion then vanishes. The real characer comes forth. The estimate of happiness is fairly formed. Hence it has been justly said, that no man can be pronounced either great or happy, until his last hour come. To that last hour, what will bring such fatisfadion, or add so much dignity, as the refletion, on having furL 2 mounted mounted with firmness all the discourageVII."
"ments of the world, and having persevered to the end in one uniform course of fidelity and honour? We remarked before, the magnanimous behaviour of the Apostle Paul, when he had persecution and distress full in view. Hear now the sentiments of the fame great man, when the time of his last suffering approached; and remark the majesty, and the ease, with which he looked on death. I am now ready to be oered, and the time  my departure is at hand. I have fougbt the good jfgt. I have finihed my courie. I have kept the faith. Hencefortb tbher is laid up for me a crown of rightovfitJf *. How many years of life does such a dying moment overbalance ? Who would not chute, in this manner, to go off the stage, with such a song of triumph in his mouth, rather than prolong his existence through a wretched old age, stained with fin and hame ?"
"* Timothy,  6. 7."
"ANIMATED ANIMATED by these considerations, let SEP:."
"us nourish that fortitude of mind, which is  so essential to a man, and a Christian. Let no discouragement, nor danger, deter us from doing what is right. Through honour and dijonour, through good report and bad report, let us preserve fidelity to our God and our Saviour. hbough an hofiboutid encamp againfi us, let us not fear to difcharge our duty. God assists us in the virtuous conflid; and will crown the conqueror with eternal rewards. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. To kim that overcometb, faith our bless."

"# SERMON  On ENVY. 1 CORINTHIANS, xiii. 4. Charity envieth not. "
"I CORINTHIANS, xiu. 4, "
"Charity enviet not."
"BERM. NVY is a sensation of uneasiness  Jj and disquiet, arising from the advantages which others are supposed to possess above us, accompanied with malignity towards those who possess them."
"This is universally admitted to be one of the blackest paflions in the human heart."
"In this world, we depend much on on2 another; and were therefore formed by Cod to be mutually iufeful and afifting."
"The inftinds of kindness and compafion which belong to our frame, Ihow how much much it was the intention of our Creator, ."
"that we should be united in friendfliip. If vilI."
"any infringe this great law of nature, by ads of causeless hostility, resentment may justly arise. No one is to be condemned for defending his rights, and ihowing difpleasure against a malicious enemy. But to conceive ill-will at one who has attacked none of our rights, nor done us any injury, solely because he is more prosperous than we are, is a disposition altogether unnatural; it suits not the human conftitution, and partakes more of the rancour of an evil spirit. Hence, the charader of an envious man is universally odious. All difclaim it; and they who feel themselves under the influence of this paflion, carefully conceal it."
"But it is proper to confider, that among all our paflions, both good and bad, there are many different gradations. Sometimes they swim on the surface of the mind, without producing any internal agitation."
"They proceed no farther than the beginnings of passion. Allayed by our conftiE  tution, or tempered by the mixture of other  dispositions, they exert no considerable influence on the temper. Though the charater in which envy forms the ruling passion, and reigns in all its force, be one too odious, I hope, to be common; yet some shade, some tincture, of this evil difpofition, mixes with molf characters in the world. It is, perhaps, one of the mot prevailing infirmities to which we are subjeCt."
"There are few but who, at one time or other, have found somewhat of this nature stirring within them; some lurking uneafinest in their mind, when they looked up to others, who enjoyed a greater share than had fallen to their lot, of some advantages which they wilhed, and thought themselves intitled, to possess. Though this should not embitter their disposition; though it should create the uncafinefs only, without the malignity, of envy; yet still it is a difturbcd Itate of mind; and always borders upon, if it actually include not, some vicious affections. In order, as far as poffible, to remedy this evil, I hall now con."
"fider fider what are the most general grounds of SERM VIIL the envy which men are apt to bear to others; and shall examine what foundation they afford, for any degree of this troublesome and dangerous paffion.-The chief grounds of envy may be reduced to three:"
"Accomplihmnents of mind; advantages of birth, rank, and fortune; superior fuccefi in worldly pursuits."
"I. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, or endowments of the mind. The chief endowment for which man deserves to be valued, is virtue."
"This, unquestionably, forms the most effimable distinction among mankind. Yet this, which may appear surprising, never forms any ground of envy. No man is envied for being more just, more generous, more patient, or forgiving, than others."
"This may, in part, be owing to virtue producing in every one who beholds it, that high degree of refped and love, which extingnifhes envy. But probably, it is more owing to the good opinion which every one entertains of his own moral qualities."
"Some SE tM. Some virtues, or, at least, the feeds of them, "
"he finds within his breait. Others, he vainly attributes to himself. Those in which he is plainly deficient, he undervalues; as either not real virtues, or virtues of very inferior rank; and relts satisfied, that, on the whole, he is as worthy and refpedtable as his neighbour."
"The cafe is different, with regard to those mental abilities and powers which are afcribed to others. As long as these are exerted in a sphere of action remote from ours, and not brought into competition with talents of the fame kind, to which we have pretensions, they create no jealousy."
"They are viewed as distant objects, in which we have not any concern. It is not until they touch our own line, and appear to rival us in what we wish to excel, that they awaken envy. Even then, envy is, properly speaking, not grounded on the talents of others. For here, too, our selfcomplacency brings us relief; from the persuasion, that were we thoroughly known, and full justice done to us, our abilities would would be found not inferior to those of our rivals. What properly occasions envy, "
"is the fruit of the accomplishments of others; the pre-eminence which the opinion of the world bestows, or which we dread it will bestow, on their talents above ours. Hence, distinguished superiority in genius, learning, eloquence, or any other of those various arts that attract the notice of the world, often become painful grounds of envy; not indeed to all indifferently, but to those who follow the fame line of pursuit. Mere rivality, inspired by emulation, would carry no reproach; were not that rivality joined with obliquity, and a malignant spirit; did it not lead to fecret detraction, and unfair methods of diminifhing the reputation of others. Too frequently has such a spirit tarnished the charater of those who fought to shine in the elegant arts; and who, otherwise, had a just title to fame.-Let such as are addided to this infirmity confider, how much they degrade themselves. Superior merit, of any kind, always refts on itself. Confcious sERM. fciou of what it deserves, it disdains low  _, competitions and jealousies. They who are itung with envy, especially when they allow its malignity to appear, confess a sense of their own inferiority; and, in effec, pay homage to that merit from which they endeavour to detract But in order to eradicate the pafion, "
"and to cure the disquiet which it creates, let such persons farther confider, how inconsiderable the advantage is which their rivals have gained, by any superiority over them. They whom you envy, are themselves inferior to others who. follow the fame pursuits. For how few, how very few, have reached the summit of excellence, in the art or study which they cultivate? Even that degree of excellence which they have attained, how eldom is it allowed to them by the world, till after they die ? Public applause is the mot fluctuating, and uncertain, of all rewards. Admired, as they may be, by a circle of their friends, they have to look up to others, who (land above them in public opinion; "
"and and undergo the fame mortifications which ER "
"you susser in looking up to them. ."
"fider what labour it has cost them to arrive at that degree of eminence they have gained; and after all their labour, how imp perfect their recompence is at lait. Within what narrow bounds is their fame confined? With what a number of humiliations is it mixed ? To how many are they absolutely unknown? Among those who know them, how many cenfire and decry them ?- Attending fairly to these confi."
"derations, the envious might come in the end to discern, that the fame acquired by anv accompliihment of the mind, by all that {kill can contrive, or genius can execute, amounts to no more than a small elevation; raises the polfeffor to such an inconsiderable height above the crowd, that others may, without disquiet, fit down contented with their own mediocrity."
"II. ADVANTAGES of fortune, superiority in birth; rank and riches, even qualificaions of body and form, become grounds of  of envy. Among external advantages, "
"-vm. those which relate to the body ought certainly, in the comparative estimation of ourselves and others, to hold the lowest place; as in the acquisition of them we can claim no merit, but must ascribe them entirely to the gift of nature. Yet envy has often Ihowed itself here in full malignity; though a small measure of reflection might have discovered, that there was little or no ground for this paflion to arise. It would have proved a blessing to multitudes, to have wanted those advantages for which they are envied. How frequently, for instance, has Beauty betrayed the poffeffors of it into many a snare, and brought upon them many a disaster ? Beheld with spiteful eyes by those who are their rivals, they, in the mean time, glow with no less envy against others by whom they are furpassed; while, in the midst of their competitions, jealousies, and concealed enmities, the fading flower is easily blasted; Ihortlived at the best; and trifling, at any rate, "
"rate, in comparison with the higher, and  more lasting beauties of the mind. VIn."
"But of all the grounds of envy among men, superiority in rank and fortune is the most general. Hence, the malignity which the poor commonly bear to the rich, as ingroffing to themselves all the comforts of life. Hence, the evil eye with which pcrfons of inferior station scrutinise those who are above them in rank; and if they approach to that rank, their envy is generally strongest against such as are just one ftep higher than themfelves.-Alas ! my friends, all this envious disquietude, which agitates the world, arises from a deceitful figure which imposes on the public view."
"False colours are hung out: the real state of men is not, what it seems to be. The order of society requires a diftintion of ranks to take place; but in point of happiness, all men come much nearer to equality than is commonly imagined; and the circumstances, which form any material difference of happiness among them, are not of that nature which renders them grounds of BERM. of envy. The poor man polfetles not, it is true, some of the conveniencies and pleasures of the rich; but, in return, he is free of many embarrassments to which they are fubjeft. By the simplicity and uniformity of his life, he is delivered from that variety of cares, which perplex those who have great affairs to manage, intricate plans to pursue, many enemies, perhaps, to encounter in the pursuit. In the tranquillity of his small habitation, and private family, he enjoys a peace which is often unknown at courts. The gratifications of nature, which are always the most satisfafory, are possessed by him to their full extent; and if he be a firanger to the refined pleasures of the wealthy, he is unacquainted also with the desire of them, and by consequence, feels no want. His plain meal satisfies his appetite, with a relifh, probably, higher than that of the rich man, who fits down to his luxurious banquet. His sleep is more found; his health more firm; he knows not what spleen, languor, or liitleffnefs are, His accustomed employments or labours are not more oppressive to him, than the labour of at- __ tendance on courts and the great, the labours of dress, the fatigue of amusements, the very weight of idleness, frequently are to the rich. In the mean time, all the beauty of the face of nature, all the enjoyments of domestic society, all the gaiety and chearfulnefs of an easy mind, are as open to him as to those of the highest rank. The splendour of retinue, the found of titles, the appearances of high refpeA, are indeed soothing, for a short time, to the great. But become familiar, they are soon forgotten. Custom effaces their impreflion. They fink into the rank of those ordinary things, which daily recur, without raising any sensation of joy.-Ceafe, therefore, from looking up with discontent and envy to those whom birth or fortune have placed above you. Adjust the balance of happiness fairly. When you think of tie enjoyments you want, think also of the troubles from which you are free. Allow their just value to the comforts you pofVOL. III. fess; "

"III. SUPERIOR success in the course of worldly pursuits, is a frequent ground of envy. Among all ranks of men, competitions arise. Wherever any favourite objed is pursued in common, jealousies feldom fail to take place among those who are equally desirous of attaining it; as in that ancient instance of envy recorded of Jgfeph brethren, who bated their brather, because tbeir father loved him more than all te ref *. .

 him. It is natural for that man, to SER  command the refpeC to which he is .
 titled by his birth or his rank. But  when I, and another, have flarted in the  race of life, upon equal terms, and in the fame rank; that he, without any pretension to uncommon merit, should  have suddenly so far outfiripped me; "
"Ihould have ingroffed all that public fa· vour to which I am no less intitled than  he; this is, what I cannot bear; my  blood boils, my spirit swells with indignation, at this undeserved treatment I  have suffered from the world. Complaints of this nature are often made, by them who seek to juffify the envy which they bear to their more prosperous neighbours. But if such persons with not to be thought unjust, let me desire them to inquire, whether they have been altogether fair in the comparison they have made of their own merit with that of their rivals; and whether they have not themselves to blame, more than the world, for being left behind in the career of fortune. The world M2 is . is not always blind or unjust, in conferring V1_.
' its favours. InRances indeed, sometimes, 
occur, of deserving persons prevented, by a fuccellion of crois incidents, from rising into public acceptance. But, in the ordinary course of things, merit, sooner or later, receives a reward; while the greater part of men misfortunes and disappointments can, generally, be traced to some mifcondua of their own. Wldlom bringeth to honour:
The band of the diligent makctb rich; and, it has been said, not altogether without rcason, that, of his own fortune in life, every man is the chief artificer. If Joseph was preferred by the father to all his brethren, his subsequent condut ihowed how well he merited the preference.

Supposing, however, the world to have.

been unjust, in an uncommon degree, with regard to you, this will not vindicate malignity and envy towards a more profperous competitor. You may accuse the world; but what reason have you to bear ill-will to him, who has only improved the favour which the world lhowed him ? If, 
by by means that are unfair, he has risen; 
and, to advance himself, has ated inju-  
rioufly by you, resentment is justifiable; but if you cannot accuse him of any fucl improper conduct, his success alone gives no fandion to your envy. You, perhaps, preferred the enjoyment of your cafe, to the stir of a busy, or to the cares of a thoughtful life. Retired from the world, and following your favourite inclinations, you were not always attentive to seize the opportunities which offered, for doing justice to your character, and improving your fituation. Ought you then to complain, if the more active and laborious have acquired what you were negligent to gain ? Confider, that if you have obtained less preferment, you have possessed more indulgence and ease. Confider, moreover, that the rival to whom you look up with repining eyes, though more fortunate in the world, may perhaps, on the whole, not be more happy than you. He has all the viciffi.
tudes of the world before him. He may have much to encounter, much to susser,  3 fiuil RM. from which you are protected by the great . er obscurity of your station. Every fituation in life, has both a bright and a dark  Let not your attention dwell only on what is bright on the of those you envy, and dark on your own. But bringing into view both fides of your refpeftive conditions, estimate fairly the fum of felicity.

THUS I have suggested several confiderations, for evincing the unreasonableness of that disquietude which envy raises in our breasts; considerations, which tend at least to mitigate and allay the workings of this malignant passion, and which, in a fober mind, ought totally to extinguish it. The scope of the whole has been, to promote, in every one, contentment with his own irate. Many arguments of a different nature may be employed against envy; some taken from its sinful and criminal nature; some, from the mischiefs to which it gives rife in the world; others, from the misery which it produces to him who nouri/hes this this viper in his bosom. But, undoubted- 



ly, the most efficacious arguments, are such  as .how, that the circumstances of others, compared with our own, afford no ground for envy. The mistaken ideas which are entertained, of the high importance of certain worldly advantages and diffindtions, form the principal cause of our repining at our own lot, and envying that of others.
To things light in themselves, our imagination has added undue weight. Did we 1llow reflection and wisdom to correct the prejudices which we have imbibed, and to disperse those phantoms of our own creating, the gloom which overcasts us would gradually vanish. Together with returning contentment, the Iky would clear up, and every objec brighten around us. It is in ehp fullen and dark fiade of discontent, 
that noxious passions, like venomous animals, breed, and prey upon the heart.

ENVY is a paflion of so odious a nature, 
that not only it is concealed as much as possible from the world, but every man is 4 glad  glad to dissemble the appearances of it to  _- his own heart. Hence, it is apt to grow upon him unperceived. Let him who is desirous to keep his heart chaste and pure from its influence, examine himself ttriCtly on those dispositions which he bears towards his prosperous neighbours. Does he ever view, with secret uneasiness, the merit of others rising into notice and diftintion?
Does he hear their praises with unwilling ear ? Does he feel an inclination to depreciate, what he dares not openly blame ?
When obliged to commend, does his cold and aukward approbation, insinuate his belief of some unknown defects in the applauded character? From such symptoms as these, he may infer that the disease of envy is forming; that the poison is beginning to spread its infection over his heart.

THE causes that nourish envy are principally two; and two which, very frequently, operate in conjunction; these are, pride and indolence. The connecion of pride with with envy, is obvious and direct. The high 


value which the proud set on their own ,_ merit, the unreaibnable claims which they form on the world, and the injustice which they suppose to be done to them by any preserence given to others, are perpetual sources, ; it of discontent, and next of envy. When indolence is joined to pride, the disease of ¥  mind becomes more inveterate and incurable. Pride leads men to claim more than they deserve. Indolence prevents them from obtaining what they might justly claim. Disappointments follow; and spleen, malignity, and envy, rage within them.
The proud and indolent, are always envious. Wrapt up in their own importance, they fit ffill, and repine, because others are more prosperous than they; while, with all their high opinion of themselves, they have done nothing either to deserve, or to acquire, prosperity. As, therefore, we value our virtue, or our peace, let us guard against these two evil dispositions of mind.
Let us be modest in our own esteem, and, by diligence and indufiry, tfudy to acquire the  the esteem of others. So shall we shut up _. the avenues that lead to many a bad passion; and {hall learn, in whbateverflate we are, bterewitb to be content.

FINALLY, in order to subdue envy,  

us bring often into view those relig1ol, considerations which regard us particularly as Christians. Let us remember how ul; worthy we all are in the fight of God; and how much the bleflings which each of us enjoy, are beyond what we deserve. Let us nourifli reverence and submission to that Divine government, which has appointed to every one such a condition in the world as is fittest for him to poflfs. Let us recolled how opposite the Christian spirit is to envy; and what sacred obligations it lays upon us, to walk in love and charity towards one another. Indeed, when we reflect on the many miseries which abound in human life; on the scanty proportion of happiness which any man is here allowed to enjoy; on the small difference which the diversity of fortune makes on that scanty proportion; 
proportion; it is surprising, that envy should 
ever have been a prevalent passion among 
men, much more that it should have prevailed among Christians. Where so much is suffered in common, little room is left for envy. There is more occasion for pity and sympathy, and inclination to aflift each other. To our own good endeavours for rectifying our dispositions, let us not forget toadd serious prayers to the Author of our being, that he who made the heart of man, and knows all its infirmities, would thoroughly purify our hearts from a pailion so base, and so criminal, as envy. Create in me, 0 God, a clean beart; and renew a right pirit within me. Search me, and know heart. Try me, and ow my thoughts. See if there be any ticked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaflig *.

# SERMON IX. On IDLENESS. MATTHEW, xx. 6.  Why stand ye here all the day idle?

[ 72 3 SERMON IX.





- Why IJand ye here all the day idle ?

 IT is an observation which naturally ocIX . curs, and has been often made, that all the representations of the Chriflian life in scripture are taken from active scenes; from carrying on a warfare, running a race, striving to enter in at a strait gate, and, as in this context, labouring in a vineyard. Hence the conclusion plainly follows, that various active duties are required of the Christian; and that sloth and indolence are inconsistent with his hope of heaven.

But But it has been sometimes supposed, that industry, as far as it is matter of duty, iL gards our spiritual concerns and employments only; and that one might be very busy as a Christian, who was very idle as a man. Hence, among some denominations of Christians, an opinion has prevailed, that the perfection of religion was to be found in those monastic retreats, where every active function of civil life was totally excluded, and the whole time of men filled up with exercises of devotion. They who hold such opinions proceed on the supposition, that religion has little or no concern with the ordinary affairs of the world; that its duties stand apart by themselves; and mingle not in the intcrcourfe which men have with one another.

# SERMON IX. On IDLENESS. MATTHEW, xx. 6.  Why stand ye here all the day idle?

[ 372 3 SERMON IX.





- Why land ye bere all tbe day idle ?

 IT is an observation which naturally ocI. 1 curs, and has been often made, that all the representations of the Christian life in scripture are taken from aaive scenes; from carrying on a warfare, running a race, striving to enter in at a strait gate, and, as in this context, labouring in a vineyard. Hence the conclusion plainly follows, that various acive duties are required of the Christian; and that sloth and indolence are inconfiltent with his hope of heaven.

But But it has been sometimes supposed, that .

industry, as far as it is matter of duty, regards our spiritual concerns and employments only; and that one might be very busy as a Christian, who was very idle as a man. Hence, among some denominations of Christians, an opinion has prevailed, that the perfection of religion was to be found in those mohaftic retreats, where every active function of civil life was totally excluded, and the whole time of men filled up with exercises of devotion. They who hold such opinions proceed on the supposition, that religion has little or no concern with the ordinary affairs of the world; that its duties stand apart by themselves; and mingle not in the intcrcourfe which men have with one another. The perfec 'Christian was imagined to live a fort of angelic life, fequestered from the business or pleasures of this contemptible state. The gospel, on the contrary, represents the religion of Christ as intended for the benefit of human society. It assumes men as engaged in the business of a.tive life; and directs its exBERM. hortations, accordingly, to all ranks _  fiations; to the magistrate and the fubje&, 
to the matter and the servant, to the rich and the poor, to them that buy and them that fell, them that use and them that abuse the world. Some duties, indeed, require privacy and retreat. But the mot important must be performed in the midst of the world, where we are commanded to jbih as lights, and by our good works to glorif our Father which is in heaven. This world, as the context represents it, is God vineyard, where each of us has a talk assigned him to perform. In every tfation, and at every period of life, labour is required. At the third, the sixth, or the eleventh hour, we are commanded to work, if we would not incur, from the great Lord of the vineyard, this reproof, Why .Jand ye here all the day idle --We may, I confess, be 'busy about many things, and yet be found negligent of the One thing needful. We may be very active, and, withal, very ill employed. But though a person may be induftrious without being religious, I must at the the fame time admonish you, that no man .
can be idle without being sinful. This I I"
"Shall endeavour to show in the sequel of the discourse; wherein I purpose to reprove a vice which is too common among all ranks of men. Superiors admonilh their inferiors, and parents tell their children, that idleness is the mother of every fin; while, in their own pracice, they often set the example of what they reprobate severely in others. I shall study to ihow, that the idle man is, in every view, both foolish, and criminal; that he neither lives to God; nor lives to the world; nor lives to him.elf."
"1. HE lives not to God. The great and wife Creator certainly does nothing in vain."
"A finall measure of refledtion might convince every one, that for some useful purpose he was sent into the world. The nature of man bears no mark of infignificancy, or negle& He is placed at the head of all things here below. He is furniihed with a great preparation of faculties and powers."
"ZERM. powers. He is enlightened by reason with _ many important difloveries; even taught by revelation to confider himself as ranfomed, by the death of Christ, from misery; and intended to rife, by gradual advances, to a still higher rank in the universe of God. In such a situation, thus diffinguiihed, thus favoured and assisted by his Creator, can he hope to be forgiven, if he aim at no improvement, if he pursue no useful design, live for no other purpose but to indulge in sloth, to consume the fruits of the earth, and to spend his days in a dream of vanity? Existence is a sacred trult; and he who thus misemploys, and squanders it away, is treacherous to its Author.- Look around you, and you will behold the whole universe full of active powers. Action is, to speak so, the genius of nature. By motion and exertion, the fyftem of being is preserved in vigour. By its different parts always acting in fubordination one to another, the perfection of the whole is carried on. The heavenly bodies perpetually revolve. Day and night incefiintly fantly repeat their appointed course. £ "
"tinual operations are going on in the earth, ,_ and in the waters. Nothing stands still."
"All is alive, and stirring, throughout the univerfe.-In the midst of this animated and busy scene, is man alone to remain idle in his place ? Belongs it to him, to be the sole inactive and slothful being in the creation, when he has so much allotted him to do; when in so many various ways he might improve his own nature; might advance the glory of the God who made him; and contribute his part to the genes ral good ?"
"Hardly is there any feeling of the human heart more natural, or more univerfal, than that of our being accountable to God. It is, what the most profligate car never totally erase. Almost all nations have agreed in the belief, that there is to come some period, when the Almighty will at as the judge of his creatures. Prefentiments of this, work in every breat. Conscience has already erected a tribunal, on which it anticipates the sentence which at  III. that Sr  that period shall be palsed. Before this tri_ bunal let us sometimes place ourselves in serious thought, and confider what account we are prepared to give of our conduc to Him who made us.  I placed you, the great Judge may then be supposed to fay,  in a station where you had many occa' sions for acion, and many opportunities  of improvement. You were taught, and  you knew, your duty. Throughout a  course of years I continued your life. I surrounded you with friends, to whom you might be useful. I gave you health, "
" ease, leisure, and various advantages of  situation.- Where are the fruits of  those talents which you possessed ? What ' good have you done with them to your selves? what good, to others? How  have you filled up your place, or answer your deitination, in the world ? Produce some evidence, of your not having existed altogether in vain ?- Let such as are now mere blanks in the world, and a burden to the earth, think what answer they will give to those awful questions."
"II. Tli  THE idle live not to the world, and SET "
"their fellow-creatures around them, any _ more than they do to God. Had any man a title to stand alone, and to be independ.ent of his fellows, he might then confider himself as at liberty to indulge in solitary ease and sloth, without being responsible to others for the manner in which he chore to live. But, on the face of the earth, there is no such person, from the King on his throne, to the beggar in his cottage. We are all conneced with one another, by various relations; which create a chain of mutual dependence, reaching from the highest, to the lowest flation in society. The order and happiness of the world cannot be maintained, without a perpetual circulation of ative duties and ofsices, which all are called upon to perform in their turn. Superiors are no more independent of their inferiors, than these inferiors are of them. Each have demands and claims upon the other; and he, who in any situation of life, refuses to his part, and to contribute his flare to the geN 2 neral . neral flock of felicity, deserves to be proar-__ Icribed from society, as an unworthy member. Ifany man will not work, fays the Apoftle Paul, neither Jhould he eat *. If he will do nothing to advance the purposes of focicty, he has no title to enjoy the advantages of it."
"It is sometimes supposed, that industry and diligence are duties required of the poor alone, and that riches confer the privilege of being idle. This is so far from being justified by reason, how often soever it may obtain in fad, that the higher one is raised in the world, his obligation to be useful is proportionably increased. The claims upon him, from various quarters, multiply. The sphere of his acive duties widens on every hand. Even fuppofmg him exempted from exerting himself in behalf of his inferiors, supposing the relation between fuiperiors and inferiors abolished, the relation among equals must still subsist."
"If there be no man, however high in rank, who stands not frequently in need of the * 2 ef iii. Ic."
"good good offices of his friends, does he think "
"that le owes nothing to them in return ? __ Can he fold his arms in fdlfilh indolence, and expet to be servcd by others, if he will not exert himself, in doing service to any ?- Were there no other call to induftry, but the relation in which every one stands to his own family, the remembrance of this alone, mhould make the man of idleness blush. Pretends he to love those with whom he is connected by the dearest ties, and yet will he not bestir himself for their guidance, their support, or their advancement in the world? How immoral, and cruel, is the part he acs, who slumbers in sensual ease, while the wants and demands of a helpless family cry aloud, but cry in vain, for his vigorous exertions ? Is this a husband, is 'this a father, that deserves to be honoured with those sacred names ?"
"How many voices will be lifted up against him, at the last day ? Let such pcrfons remember the awful words of scripture, and tremble. It is written in the FIirif Epistle to Timothy, the fifth chapter, and eighth 3 verse, "
"8 RM. verse, if any proviae not for his own, and I. specially for thoSe of his own house, ht bath denied the faith, and is worfc than an infidel."
"III. THE idle man lives not to himself, "
"with any more advantage than he lives to the world. It is indeed on a supposition entirely opposite, that persons of this charafter proceed. They imagine that, how deficient soever they may be in point of duty, they at least consult their own satisfadion. They leave to others the drudgery of life; and betake themselves, as they think, to the quarter of enjoyment and ease. Now, in contradition to this, I asfert, and hope to prove, that the idle man, first, shuts the door against all improvement; next, that he opens it wide to every deftruCive folly; and, lastly, that he excludes himself from the true enjoyment of pleasure."
"FIRST, He shuts the door against improvement of every kind, whether of mind, "
"body, or fortune. The law of our nature, "
"the condition under which we were placed ,_ from our birth, is, that nothing good or great is to be acquired, without toil and in."
"duftry. A price is appointed by Providence to be paid for every thing; and the price of improvement, is labour. Induftry may, indeed, be Sometimes disappointed."
"The race may not be always to the fwifi, nor the battle to the flrong. But, at the fame time, it is certain that, in the ordinary course of things, without strength, the battle cannot be gained; without swiftness, the race cannot be run with success."
"In all labour, fays the wife man, there is prfit; but the foul of the Jluggard defireth, and bath nothing *. If we consult either the improvement of the mind, or the health of the body, it is well known that exercise is the great instrument of promoting both."
"Sloth enfeebles equally the bodily, and the mental powers. As in the animal system it engenders disease, so on the faculties of * Prov. xiv. 3.; xiii. 4."
"N 4 the  the foul it brings a fatal rust, which corIx."
"_ rodes and waftes them; which, in a ihort time, reduces the brightest genius to the fame level with the meanest underitanding."
"The great differences which take place among men, are not owing to a diflinftion that nature has made in their original powers, so much as to the superior diligence with which some have improved these powers beyond others. To no purpose do we possess the feeds of many. great abilities, if they are suffered to lie dormant within us. It is not the latent possession, but the active exertion of them, which gives them merit. Thousands whom indolence has funk into contemptible obfcurity, might have come forward to the highell diftinclion, if idleness had not fruftrated the effect of all their powers."
"Instead of going on to improvement, all things go to decline, with the idle man."
"His character falls into contempt. His fortune is consumed. Disorder, confusion, and embarraffmcnt, mark his whole fituation, Obfcrve in what lively colours the gtatc state of his affairs is described by Solomon. sE RMI I went by the field of the Jlothfil, and by the vineyard of the man void of nnderJlanding."
"And lo ! it was all grown over with thorns; and nettles bad covered the face thereof; and the flone wall thereof was broken down."
"Then I saw and confidered it well. I looked upon it, and received irnrtrution *. In the midst, too, of those distresses which idleness brings on its votaries, they must submit to innumerable mortifications, which never fail to attend their mhameful conduct They must reckon, on feeing themselves contemned by the virtuous and wife, and flighted by the thriving part of mankind."
"They mutt expeEt to be left behind by every competitor for rank or fortune. They will be obliged to humble themselves before persons, now far their superiors in the world, whom, once, they would have difdained to acknowledge as their equals.Is it in this manner, that a man lives to himself? Are these the advantages, which * Prov.  30. 31. 32."
"were  were expeced to be found in the lap of uL ease ? The down may at firif have appeared soft: But it will soon be found to cover thorns innumerable. How long wilt thou sleep, 0 Juggard ? When wilt tbou arif out es thyr jeep ? et a little Je+); yet a little Jlmdber, a little folding of the bands to jlep."
"S Jball thy poverty come as one that travelbtb; thy want ai an armed 7man *."
"But this is only a small part of the evils rhich persons of this description bring on themfelvea: For, "
". IN the second place, while in this manner they shut the door against every improvement4 they open it wide to the most deftrutive vices and follies. The human mind cannot remain always unemployed. Its paflions must have some exercife. If we supply them not with proper employment, they are sure to run loose into riot and disorder. While we are unoccupied by what is good, evil is coninu*Prov. xxiv. 33. 34."
"ally ally at hand; and hence it is said in Scrip- RM."
"ture, that as soon as Satan found the bouse IX."
"empty, he took pofreffion, and filled it witb evil. firits *. Every man who recollecs his conduA, may be satisfied, that his hours of idleness have always proved the hours most dangerous to virtue. It was then, that criminal desires arose; guilty pursuits were suggested; and deligns were formed, which, in their iflue, have difquitted and embittercd his whole life. If seasons of idleness be dangerous, what must a continued habit of it prove ? Habitual indolence, by a silent and secret progress, undermines every virtue in the foul. More violent passions run their course, and terminate. They are like rapid torrents, which foam, and swell, and bear down every thing before them. But after having overflowed their banks, their impetuosity subfdes. They return, by degrees, into their natural channel; and the damage which they have done, can be repaired. Sloth is Mtth. xii. 44."
"like SERI. like the flowly-flowing, putrid itream, %_A, which stagnates in the marsh, breeds venomous animals, and poisonous plants; and infects with pestilential vapours the whole country round it. Having once tainted the foul, it leaves no part of it found; and, at the fame time, gives not those alarms to conscience, which the eruptions of bolder and fiercer emotions often occasion. The disease which it brings on, is creeping and iniidious; and is, on that account, more certainly mortal."
"One constant effeca of idleness, is to nourifh the passions, and, of course, to heighten our demands for gratification; while it unhappily withdraws from us the proper means of gratifying these demands. If the desires of the industrious man be set upon opulence or rank, upon the conveniencies, or the splendour of life, he can accomplifi his desires, by methods which are fair and allowable. The idle man has the fame defires with the industrious, but not the fame resources for compafling his ends by honourable means. He must therefore turn himself himself to seek by fraud, or by violence, "
"what he cannot submit to acquire by _ dultry. Hence, the origin of those multiplied crimes to which idleness is daily giving birth in the world; and which contribute so much to violate the order, and to disturb the peace, of society.- In general, the children of idleness may be ranked under two denominations or classes of men; both of whom may, too justly, be termed, The children of the devil. Either, incapable of any effort, they are such as fink into absolute meanness of character, and contentedly wallow with the drunkard and debauchee, among the herd of the fcnfual; until poverty overtake them, or disease cut them off: Or, they are such as, retaining some remains of vigour, are impelled, by their passions, to venture on a desperate attempt for retrieving their ruined fortunes."
"In this cafe, they employ the art of the fraudulent gamester to ensnare the unwary. They issue forth with the highwayman to plunder on the road; or with the thief and the robber, they infest the city BERM. city by night. From this class, our prif_, sons are peopled; and by them the scaffold is furnished with those melancholy admonitions, which are so often delivered from it to the crowd. Such are frequently the tragical, but well known, consequences of the vice against which I now warn you."
"IN the third, and last place, how dangerous soever idleness may be to virtue, are there not pleasures, it may be said, which attend it ? Is there not ground to plead, that it brings a release from the op."
"preflive cares of the world; 4nd sooths the mind with a gentle fatisfa&ion, which is not to be found amidst the toils of a busy and active life --This is. an advantage which, least of all others, we admit it to possess. In behalf of incessant labour, no man contends. Occasional release from toil, and indulgence of ease, is what nature demands, and virtue allows. But what we assert is, that nothing is so great an enemy to the lively and spirited enjoyment of life, as a relaxed and indolent habit of mind."
"He He who knows not what it is to labour,  knows not what it is to enjoy. The feli- _ city of human life, depends on the regular prosecution of some laudable purpose or object, which keeps awake and enlivens all our powers. Our happiness consists in the pursuit, much more than in the attainment, of any temporal good. Reft is agreeable; but it is only from preceding labours, that reft acquires its true relish. When the mind is suffered to remain in continued inaction, all its powers decay. It soon languifhes and sickens; and the pleasures which it proposed to obtain from refit, end in tediousness and insipidity. To this, let that mifcrable set' of men bear witness, who, after spending great part of their life in active indutfry, have retired to what they fancied was to be a pleasing enjoyment of thtmfelves, in wealthy inactivity, and profound repose. Where they expeted to find an elysium, they have found nothing but a dreary and comfortlefs waste. Their days have dragged on, in uniform languor; with the melancholy  choly remembrance often returning, of the chearful hours they passed, when they were engaged in the honelt business, and labours of the world."
"We appeal to every one who has the least knowledge or observation of life, whether the busy, or the idle, have the mos agreeable enjoyment of themselves ? Compare them in their families. Compare them in the societies with which they mingle; and remark, which of them discover most chearfulnefs and gaiety; which possess the most regular flow of spirits; whose temper is most equal; whose good humour, most unclouded. While the active and diligent both enliven, and enjoy, society, the idle are not only a burden to themselves, but a burden to those with whom they are conneaed; a nuisance to all whom they oppress with their company. On whom does time hang so heavy, as on the slothful and lazy ? To whom are the hours so lingering? Who are so often devoured with spleen, and obliged to fly to every expedient which can help them to get rid of themselves ?"
"themselves ? Instead of producing tran- "
"quillity, indolence produces a fretful reft- _ leffnefs of mind; gives rife to cravings which are never satisfied; nourilhes a sickly effeminate delicacy, which fours and corrupts every pleasure."
"ENOUGH has now been said to convince every thinking person, of the folly, the guilt, and the misery, of an idle state. Let these admonitions stir us up, to exert ourfeyves in our different occupations, with that virtuous ativity which becomes men and Christians. Let us arise from the bed of sloth; distribute our time with attention and care; and improve to advantage the opportunities which Providence has bestowed. The material business in which our several stations engage us, may often prove not sufficient to occupy the whole of our time and attention. In the life even of busy men, there are frequent intervals of leisure. Let them take care, that into these, none of the vices of idleness creep."
"Let some secondary, some subsidiary emVOL. III. ployment, "
" ployment, of fair and laudable kind, be _ always at hand to fill up those vacant spaces of life, which too many aflign, either to corrupting amusements, or to mere inaction. We ought never to forget, that entire idleness always borders, either on mifery, or on guilt AT the fame time, let the course of our employments be ordered in such a manner, that in carrying them on, we may be also promoting our eternal interest. With the business of the world, let us properly intermix the exercises of devotion. By religious duties, and virtuous actions, let us fludy to prepare ourselves for a better world."
"In the midst of our labours for this life, it is jnver to be forgotten, that we must first seek the kingdom of God, and bis rigbteoufnefS; and give diligence to make our calling and eleclion sure. Otherwise, how ative soever we may seem to be, our whole activity will prove only a laborious idleness: We shall appear in the end, to have been busy to no purpose, or to a purpose worse than none."
"Then Then only we fulfil the proper character of RM."
"Christians, when we join that pious zeal which becomes us as the servants of God, with that industry which is required of tn, as good members of society; when, according to the exhortation of the Apostle, we are found not Jlothful in buftnefs, and, at the fame time, fervent in spirit, fJrving the '"

"On the SENSE of the DIVINE PRESENCI."
"PSALM Ixxiii. 23."
"_ I am continually with thbe -."
"tSRM. ive in a world which is full of the divine presence and power. We behold every where around us the traces of that supreme goodness, which enlivens and fipports the univerie. Day utteretb fpeccb of it to day; and night Jhowetb knowledge of it to night. Yet, surrounded as we are with the perfections of God, meeting him whereever we go, and called upon by a thousand objecs, to confess his presence, it is both the misfortune and the crime of a great part of of mankind, that they are strangers to Him in whose world they dwell. Occipied with  nothing but their purfuiits of inteteft and pleasure, they pass through this world, as though God were not theie. The virtuous and reflecting, are particularly diftinguifhed from the giddy and dissolute, by that habitual sense of the divine presence which charaderifes the formner. To them, nothing appears void of God. They contemplate his perfetions in the works of nature; and they trace his Providence in the incidents of life. When retired from the world, he often employs their meditation. When engaged in ation, he always influences their conducd Wherever a pious man is, or whatever he does, in ile style of the text, he is continually with Cad."
"The happy effedt of this sentiment on the heart, is fully displayed in the context."
"We fee it allaying all the disquiet which the Psalmist, in the preceding verses, describes himself to have suffered on account of the prosperity of the wicked. The sirs reflection *hich leftored tranquillity to his 0 3 mind, "
"SERK. mind, was the remembrance of the pre. _ fence of God. Neverthelefi, I am continually with thee; thou bast bolden me by my right hand. He became sensible, that whatever distresses the righteous might susser for a time, they could not fail of being compensated in the end, by that Almighty Protector, whose propitious presence ever continued to surround them. Whereupon follow those memorable expressions of his trult and joy in God. Thou faltguide me witb thy counsel; and afterwards receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth I defre chfbdes thee."
"THERE are principally two effects, which the.fenfe of the divine pretence is fitted to produce upon men. One is, to restrain them from vice; the other, to encourage their virtue. Its operation, as a check upon the finner, is obvious. The perpetual presence of so powerful and venerable a witness, is one of the most awful confideratio4 which can be addressed to the dif."
"'solute. It removes all the security which secrecy can be supposed to give to crimes..,_ ~"
"It aggravates the guilt of them, from being committed in face of the Almighty; and has power to strike terror into the heart of the greatest criminal, in the midst'"
"of his misdeeds. While this principle of religion thus checks and terrifies the fin ner, it produces also another effect, that oft flengthening and comforting the good man, in the pratice of his duty. It is the influence of the divine presence on good men, which, in consequence of the Psalmist sentiment, I purpose to confider. To their character, it belongs to be continually with God. I shall endeavour to show the high benefit and comfort which they derive from such a habit of mind; and shall, for this end, first confider their internal moral state; and next, view them as they are asfeted by several of the external accidents and situations of life."
"LET us begin with confidering them in their internal state. The belief of divine 0 4 presence  prefnce ads upon them here, firfl, as an ,, incitement to virtue. The presence of one whom we highly esteem and revere, of a sovereign, for initance, a father, or a friends whose approbation we are solicitous to gain, is always found to exalt the powers of men+"
"to refine, and improve their behaviour."
"Hence, .it has been given as a rule by ancient moralists, that, in order to excel in virtue, we should propound to ourselves some person of eminent and diftinguilhed worth; and should accustom ourselves to ac, as if he were standing by, and beholding us. To the esteem and approbation of their fellow creatures, none are insenfible. There are few who, in the confpicuous parts of their life, when they know the eyes of the public to be fixed on them,  not their part with propriety and decorum. But what is the observation of the public, what is the presence of the greatest or wifcft man on earth, to that pretence of the Divinity which conltantly surrounds us? The man who realises to his mind this august presence, feels a constant incentive tire for acquitting himself with dignity. "
"He views himself as placed on an illuftri- _ ous theatre. To have the Almighty for the fpeator and witness of his condut, is more to him than if the whole world were assembled to observe him. Men judge often falsely, always imperfectly, of what ptfics before them. They are imposed on by specious appearances; and the artful carry away the praise which is due to the deserving. Even fuppofmg them to judge fairly, we may want the opportunity of doing justice to our charaAer, by any proper display of it in the fight of the world."
"Our situation may bury in obscurity, those talents and virtues which were intitled to mminand the highest efteemn. But he, in whose preenrce the good man a  is both an impartial, and an unerring judge of worth. No fallacious appearances impose on him. No secret virtue is hidden from him. He is attentive equally to the meaneft and the greatest; and his approbation confers eternal rewards. The man, therefore, who sets the Lord always before him, "
"is sS  is prompted to excel in virtue by motives, "
"which are peculiar to himself, and which engage, on the of duty, both honour and interest. I have kept tby precepts, and thy teflimonies; for all my ways are before thee *."
"SUPPOSING, however, his virtubus endeavours to be faithful, many imperfections will attend them. A faultless tenor of unblemished life, is beyond the reach of man. Paflions will sometimes overcome him; and ambition or interest, in an unguarded hour, will turn him aside into evil. Hence, he will be aihamed of himself, and disquieted by a sense of guilt and folly. In this fRate, to which we are often reduced by the weakness of human nature, the belief of God continual pretence brings relief to the heart. It aced before as an animating principle. It now ats as a principle of comfort. In the midst of many imperfections, a virtuous man appeals to his divine witness, for the sincerity of his intentions."
"He can appeal to him who knows bis frame, that in the general train of his conduct, it is his study to keep the law of God."
"Mere law, among men, is rigid and inflexible. As no human lawgiver can look into the hearts of his fubjeets, he cannot, even though he were ever present with them, estimate their character exactly. He can make no allowance for particular situations. He mutt prescribe the fame terms to all whom he rules; and treat all alike, according to their outward actions. But every minute diversity of character, temper, and situation, is known to God. It is not only from what his servants do, but from what they seek to do, that he forms his judgement of them. He attends to all those circumstances which render the trial of their virtue, at any time, peculiarly hard. He hears the whisper of devotion as it rifes in the foul He beholds the tear of contrition which falls in secret."
"He fees the good intention struggling in its birth; and pursues it, in its progress, "
"through ft  thrdugh those various obstacles whtich ta  prevent it from ripehing into adion. Good mnn, therefore, Ih theit noll humbled and dejeded state, draw some consolation from his klowledge of their eattrt Though they iay sometimes hive erred from the right path, they can look up to hiih who is ever with them, and fay, as at apostle, wiho hli grievously offnded, oie said to his great Malfet; Lord, tboa itMstvOt all things; bou Inowefl that I ove thee *."
"Appealing thte to therr ofnnifcient withess, they are naturilly soothed and encouraged by the hope of his' clemency. At the fame time, it is the peculiar advantage of this fentimnent of the divine presence, that it prevents such hope from flattering them too much, or rising into undue pteflmtption. For while it encourages, it tends also fdt humble, a Fious man. If it encourage him, by the refedion on all his good dispositions being known and attended to by God, it humbles him, by the remembrance, that bis seret fins also are ever in the light of the divine countenance. So that, by ., dwelling under the sense of God being continually with us, we keep alive the proper temper of a Christian in the foul; humility, without dejection; fear, mingled with hope."
"We are cheared, without being lifted up."
"We feel ourselves obnoxious to the all-obferving eye ofjullice ; but are comforted with the thoughts qs that mercy which, through Jesus Christ, the Discerner of all hearts holds forth to the fncere and penitent."
"Such are the blessed effects which this principle of religion produces upon the inward moral itate of a good man. Let us now, "
"IN the second place, confider his external circumstances; and examine the influence which the fame principle has upon his happiness, in several different situations of life."
"LET us first view him in what the world calls prosperity; when his circumstances are easy or affluent, and his life flows in a smooth  smooth untroubled stream. Here, it might  be thought, that a sense of the divine prefence could operate upon him only, or chiefly, for promoting temperance, and re."
"ftraixiing the disorders incident to a profperous fate. Valuable effects, indeed, these are; and molt conducive to the true enjoyment of all that is agreeable in life. But though it, doubtless, does exert this falutary influence, yet it (tops not there. It not only preserves the virtue of a good man amidit the temptations of pleasure, but it gives to his prosperity a security, and a peculiar relish, which to others is unknown."
"He who is without a sense of God upon his mind, beholds in human affairs nothing but a perpetual fluctuation, and viciflitude of events. He is surrounded with unknown causes, which may be working his deftruction in secret. He cannot avoid perceiving, that there hangs over him the irresistible arm of that Providence, whose displeasure he has done nothing to flay or avert. But he who, in the day of prosperity, dwells with God, is delivered from those disquieting alarms. He dwells as with a friend and protetor, from whom he conceives his _ blessings to proceed. He can appeal to him for the thankfulness with which he receives them; and for his endeavours to employ them well. He trusts, that the God whom he serves will not forsake him; that the goodness which he has already experienced, will continue to bless him; and though he believes himself not exempted from the changes of the world, yet, in the midst of these, he has ground to hope, that sources of comfort and happiness ihall always be left open to him."
"Moreover, the pleasures of life, while they last, are unspeakably heightened by the presence of that Benefactor who bestows them. The pleasing emotion of gratitude to the giver, mingles with the enjoyment of the gift. While to the mere worldly man, the whole frame of nature is only a vast irregular fabric; and the course of human affairs no more than a confused fuc."
"cefllon of fortuitous events; all nature is beautified, and every agreeable incident is enlivened, "
" enlivened, to him who beholds God in all   things. Hence arise a variety of pleasing sensations, to fill up those solitary hours, in which external prosperity supplies him with no entertainment. In the smiling scenes of nature, he contemplates the benignity of its author. In its sublime objecs, he admires his majesty. In its awful and terrible ones, he adores his power. He dwells in this world as in a magnificent temple, which is full of the glory of its founder; and every where views nature offering up its incense to him, from a thousand altars."
"Such ideas exalt and ennoble the human mind; and refle an additional lustre on the brightness of prosperity."
"FROM the prosperous, let us next turn to the afflicted condition of a good man. For, as prosperity may, afflition certainly will, at one time or other, be his lot. It enters into the appointed trial of his virtue; and, in one degree or other, is the doom of all."
"Here we ihall find various situations occur, in which no relief is equal to what a virtuous ruous and holy man derives from a fcnfe of "
"the perpetual presence of God. Is he, for instance, thrown into an obfcure condition in the world, without friends to assist him, or any to regard and confider his itate? He enjoys the fatisfacion of thinking, that though he may be neglected by men, he is not forgotten by God. Inconsiderable as he is in himself, he knows, that he will not be overlooked by the Almighty, amidit the infinite variety of being, or loft in the immensity of his works."
"The poor man can, with as much encouragement as the rich or great, lift up his eyes to heaven, and fay, NAvertbeles, 0 Lord, lam continually with thee: Thou bold."
"efi me by my right hand. The gracious prefence of that Supreme Being is affected by no diversity of rank or fortune. It imparts itself alike to all the virtuous and upright; like its glorious image, the fun in the firmament, which iheds its rays equally upon the humble cottage, and upon the palace of Kings. In the presence of the great Lord of heaven and earth, all the diftindions  III. which GE RM. which vanity has contrived to make among . ' men, totally disappear. All ranks are on one level. The rich and the poor here indeed meet together; without any other diftindtion than what arises from the heart and the fouL The sense of this, lifts the poor man above contempt; supports his spirits when apt to be dejeced; and beitows dignity on the part which he ads. How inconsiderable soever that part may appear in the eftimation of an injudicious world, it is ennobled, when virtuously performed, by the approbation of his divine witness. He can bear with indifference the scorn of the proud, as long as he knows, that there is one higher than the highest to regard hin."
"He can enjoy himself with pleasure in his mean habitation, because he believes that God dwells with him there. The Divine presence chears to him the moit lonely retreat. It accompanies his steps to the most distant regions of the earth. If he should be driven into exile from all his friends, and obliged to dwell in the uttermol? parts of the sea, even there God band would would bold him, and his right band would ER "
"guide him. Though left without compa- _ nion or friend, he never thinks himself desolate, as long as he can fay, Iam Jfill with God."
"BUT though raised above obscurity or poverty, yet, in any situation of fortune, calumny and reproach may be the lot of the servant of God. His good intentions may be mifconftruced; his character unjustly traduced; and, to the open reviling of enemies, the more bitter unkindness of friends may Sometimes be joined. In this fituation, when wounded in spirit, and, perhaps, unable to make his innocence appear, to whom ihall he have recourse for defence, to whom make his last appeal, but to that God who is ever present with him, and who knoweth his heart How frequently, amidst the injustice and oppression of the world, has diftrefled innocence had no other relief but this ?  God is my witness. God is my avenger. He hath seen it; and he will repay. A good con8 ER  science, it is true, is, of itself, a powerful "
",__ support. But God is Lord of the conscience; and it is only when connected with a sense of divine pretence and approbation, that a good conscience becomes a steady principle of fortitude in the mind, under all discouragements. Hence, a virtuous man possesses a high degree of independence, both on the praise, and on the censure of the world. It is enough to him, if, when undergoing the fame reproaches which Job suffered from his mistaken friends, he can fay with him, Behold my witntefs is in heaven, and my record is on bigb *. He affecs not to divulge his good deeds to the world. He is without concern whether the world be acquainted with them, or not. He knoweth, that his Father which is in heaven Jeetb in secret; and that his prayers and his alms come up in grateful memorial before him. With me, it is a small thing to be judged of you, or of man judgement; be that judgetb me is the Lord  JIt * Job ri. 39. I Cor.  I. 4."
"Jhall Jball bring forth my rigbteoufnefs, at last, as SERtM the light, and my judgement as the noon day. In this consciousness of integrity, he looks down with indifference, as from a superior station, upon the harsh censures of a giddy and ignorant world. The sense of being continually with God diffuses over his foul a holy calm, which unjust reproach cannot disturb. In the presence of that august and venerable witness, all the noise and clamours of men, like the murmurings of a distant storm, die away."
"LASTLY, Supposing the character of a good man to be untainted by reproach, supposing also his external situation to be opulent or diftinguiihed, many, notWithstanding, and revere, are the diftreefes to which he may be exposed. Secret griefs may be preying upon him; and his heart left to feed in silence on its own bitterness."
"He may labour under fore disease, and difcern his earthly frame gradually mouldering into dust. He may be deprived of those friends and relatives who had been the 3 chief  chief comforts of his tfate; or may be obX."
"e* _ liged to prepare himself for taking farewel of them for ever. In the midst of these various afflicting scenes of human life, no consolation can be more powerful than what arises from the pretence of a divine protector and guardian, to whom our cafe, with all its sorrows, is perfectly known."
"To him, fays the Pfalnift, I poured out my complaint. IJb/hwed before him my trouble."
"I looked Gn my right band and viewed; but behold there was no man who caredfor my foul. I aid unto thee, 0 Lord, thou art my refuge. When my spirit wal overwhelmed within me, then thou knewejl my path *."
"We all know, that to communicate our gricf to a faithful friend, often gives ease and relief to the burdened heart Such communication we are encouraged to make, and such relief we may expecA to find, in pouring out our heart before that God in whom compaffons flow. We may have no earthly friend to whom we can with full confi."
"Psalm clii. 2. 3. 4."
"dence dence disclose all our sorrows; or we may "
"want words in which to express them. But __ God is the fearchcr of all hearts; and the hearer of all prayers. To the secret anguifh of the foul, he is no inattentive witness. Every groan which is heaved from the labouring bosom, though heard by no hnman car, reaches his throne. As he knows our frame, so he remembhers are duJf; and thence light arise to the upright in darknefi. For the hope naturally springs, that this beneficent being will pity them, as a father pitieth his children; and in the midst of those diftrefles which the present circumftances of man reider unavoidable, willfend them help from his fanfltary. Surrounded with this compassionate pretence of the Almighty, good men never view themselves as left in this vale of tears, to bear, solitary and alone, the whole weight of human woe. In their dark, as well as in their brighter hours, God is with them."
"Even in that valley of the shadow of death, where no friiend, no comforter, can go along to aid them, he is with them still. In 4 the 8ERM. the last extremity of nature, the rod and flaf of the Shepherd of Ifratd support them."
"THUS I have ihown, though in an imperfec manner, what benefits holy men derive from a habitual sense of the divine presence. It animates and strengthens their virtue. It enlivens and brightens their profperity. Under various forms of adversity, it affords them consolation and relief.Such considerations, undoubtedly, form a strong argument in favour of a devout fpirit, and a virtuous life. But they are confiderations which may, probably, be regarded by some, as ideal and visionary; requiring aid from a heated, or an enthusiastic fancy, in order to give them force. I readily admit, that amidst the hurry and turbulence of the world, it may be difficult to bring these religious sentiments as fully into view, as is necessary for their making a just impreflion on the foul. This requires the effort of an intelligent and feeling mind; and therefore cannot be expected to be commonly found. To the unreflecting crowd, nothing appears real, but what pR."
"is exposed to sense. What is invisible, is the fame to them, as if it had no existence."
"But by the grossness of their own conceptions, they have no title to measure those of others. While they asseE to treat all confiderations taken from the sense of the divine pretence, as visionary and enthufiaftic, it can, on the contrary, be clearly ihown, that they are founded on the most certain and unquestionable principles of reason. They essentially belong not to revealed only, but to natural, religion. Their reality can be denied by none, but those who deny that God exists, or that he governs the world. For, if he exist, he must undoubtedly pervade and infpet the world which he governs. He muit know what is going on throughout his own universe; and especially must know what passes within the hearts which he has made, and of which he is to judge. To be every where present, is the attribute of his nature, which, of all others, is the mods necessary to his admiiiftration of the universe. This, "
" accordingly, is an attribute which all _ ligions have ascribed to him. All nations have believed in it. All societies appeal to it, in the folemnities of an oath, by which they determine controversies. This attribute being once admitted to belong to the Deity, the consequences which I have deduced from it, plainly and naturally follow: And every good man has ground to fay, 0 Lord, Iam continually with thee."
"# SERMON XI. ON PATIENCE. LUKE, xxi. 19. In your Patience possess ye your souls."
"E 219 3 SERMON XI."
"In your Patience poefl  your fouls."
"rHE pfffoni of our ulh is a very em- "
"phatical expression. It describes that XI."
"fate in which a man has both the ful command, and the undisturbed enjoyment of himself; in opposition to his undergoing some inward agitation which difcomposes his powers. Upon the leat reflection, it mft appear, how essential such a slate of mind. is to happiness. He only who thns pei bi foul is capable of poffefling any other thing with advantage; and in order to attain and preserve this self felf-pofleffion, the most important requiiwt is, the habitual exercise of patience."
"I know that patience is apt to be ranked by many, among the more humble and obscure virtues; belonging chiefly to those who groan on a sick-bed, or who languish in a prison. If their situation be, happily, of a different kind, they imagine that there is no occasion for the dilcipline of patience being preached to them. But I hope to make it appear, that, in every circumstance of life, no virtue is more important, both to duty and to happiness; or more requisite for forming a manly and worthy cha."
"racer. It is not confined to a situation of continued adversity. It principally, indeed, regards the disagreeable circumstances which are apt to occur. But, in our present state, the occurrence of these is so frequent, that, in every condition of life, patience is incessantly called forth."
"Prosperity cannot be enjoyed, any more than adversity supported, without it. It must enter into the temper, and form the habit of the foul, if we would pafi through the the world with tranquillity and honour. "
"What I purpose is, to point out some of the chief occasions on which patience is required; and to recommend and enforce the exercise of it, in order to our pojing eur fouls."
"I. PATIENCE under provocations. The wide circle of human society is diversified by an endless variety of characters, difpofitions, and paflions. Uniformity is, in no refpea, the genius of the world. Every man is marked by some peculiarity which distinguishes him from another: and no where can two individuals be found who are exactly, and in all refpets, alike."
"Where so much diversity obtains, it cannot but happen, that, in the intercourse which men are obliged to maintain, their tempers {hall often be ill adjusted to that intercourse; {hall jar, and interfere with each other. Hence, in every fation, the highest as well as the lowest, and in every condition of life, public, private, and domeftic, occafions-of irritation frequently arise."
"We  We are provoked, sometimes, by the folly ,Xl. and levity of those with whom we are conneted; sometimes, by their indifference or neglec; by the incivility of a friend, the haughtiness of a superior, or the insolent behaviour of one in lower station. Hardly a day passes, without somewhat or other occurring,whichferves to ruffle the man of impatient spirit. Of course, such a man lives in a continual form. He knows not what it is to enjoy a train of good humour."
"Servants, neighbours, friends, spouse, and children, all, through the unrestrained violence of his temper, become sources of difturbance and vexation to him. In vain is affluence; in vain are health and profperity. The lealt trifle is sufficient to difcompose his mind, ana poitbn his pleafures. His very amusements are mixed with turbulence and passion."
"I would beseech this man to confider, of what small moment the provocations which he receives, or at least imagines himself to receive, are really in themselves; but of what great moment he makes them, by fullering faffering them to deprive him of the pof- "
"'session of himself. I would befcech him, I to confider, how many hours of happineis he throws away, which a little more patience would allow him to enjoy; and how much he puts it in the powcr of the moit insignificant persons to render lim miserable.  But who can expect, we hear him exclaim,  that he is to possess the infenfibility of a itone ? How is it possible for human nature to endure so many re peated provocations? or to bear calmly with such unreasonable behaviour?My brother ! if you can bear with no in."
"'stances of unreasonable behaviour, withdraw yourself from the world. You are no longer fit to live in it. Leave the intercourfe of men. Retreat to the mountain, and the desert; or fliut yourself up in a cell. For here, in the midst of society, of'nces mtl conic. You might as well expec, when you beheld a calm atmoi)here, and a clear Iky, that no clouds were ever to rife, and no winds to blow, as that your life was long to proceed, without receiving sr  ceiving provocations from human frailty."
"__, The careless and the imprudent, the giddy and the fickle, the ungrateful and the interested, every where meet us. They are the briars and the thorns, with which the paths of human life are beset. He only who can hold his course among them with patience and equanimity, he who is prepared to bear what he must expet to happen, is worthy of the name of a man."
"Did you only preserve yourself compofed for a moment, you would perceive the insignificancy of molt of those provocations which you magnify so highly. When a few funs more have rolled over your head, the storm will have, of itself, subsided; the cause of your present impatience and diturbance will be utterly forgotten. Can you not, then, anticipate this hour of calmness to yourself; and begin to enjoy the peace which it will certainly bring ? If others have behaved improperly, leave them to their own folly, without becoming the victim of their caprice, and punishing yourself on their account. Patience, in this exercise of it, "
"cannot cannot be too much studied by all who wish their life to flow in a smooth stream. "
"It is the reason of a man, in opposition to the passion of a child. It is the enjoyment of peace, in opposition to uproar and confusion. He that bath no rule over his own spirit, i like a city that is broken down, and withost walk *.-The next important exercife of patience is, "
"II. PATIENCE under disappointments."
"These will often happen to the best and wisest men; sometimes, to the wisest and best concerted plans. They may happen, too, not through any imprudence of thoe who have devised the plan, not even through the malice or ill design of others but merely in cenfequence of some of those croft incidents of life which could not be foreseen. On such occations, persons of a warm and sanguine temper are presently in a ferment. They had formed their hopes, as they think, upon the jufteft grounds."
"* Prr', lxv. 0t."
"Voi.. III. Q They aERM. They had waited long for success; and xl. xsL( borne with many delays. But when their designs are brought to so unexpected an issue; when, without any fault of their own, they find their hopes finally blasted, all patience forsakes them; they no longer possess their fouls; the molt passionate exclamations break forth.  To whom, ex cept to them, could such a disappoint ment have happened? Since the creation of the world, was such a combination of  disastrous incidents ever beheld? Why i are they doomed to be so unfortunate  beyond all others ?- Alas ! how unflilfully have you calculated the course of human events ? How raihly and prefumptuoufly had you trusted to success? To whom was it ever given, to guard against all the vicissitudes, which the fluctuating fajbion of the world is incessantly bringing about ? If one friend, to whom you looked up has died, or another has loft his influence and power; if the opinion of the public is changed, and its favour has been withdrawn; if some mistakes have occurred red to lessen the good will of a patron on ER "
"whom you depended; if, through the concurrence of these, or such like circumstances, a more fortunate rival has prevailed against you ; what is there in all this, that differs from the ordinary lot of man ?"
"Are we not, each in his turn, doomed to experience the uncertainty of worldly pursuits ? Why, then, aggravate our misfortunes by the unreasonable violence of an impatient spirit ? If our designs have failed through rashness or mifcondud, let us blame ourselves. If they have failed through circumstances which we could not prevent, let us submit to the fate of man; and wait, with patience, till a more favourable opportunity Ihall occur of regaining success."
"Meanwhile, let us turn to the other oT the profpecd; and calmly confider how dubious it was, whether the success which we longed for, would have proved a blefsing. Who knoweth what is good for man in this life ? Perhaps, the accomplishment of our designs might have been pregnant Q 2 with 8ERM. with misery. Perhaps, from our present tJ-_ isappointment, future prosperity may rife."
"Of such unlooked for iffucs, we all know there have been many examples. Who can tell, whether our cafe may not add one to the number ?-At any rate, let us recollet, that there is a Supreme Ruler, who disposes of the affairs of men; under whom, all fecond causes work only as subordinate agents. Looking up to that irresistible arm which is stretched over our heads, let us be calm; let us submit and adore. Either to despair, or to rage, under disappointments, is sinful. By the former, we injure outfelves. By the latter, we insult Providence, and provoke its displeasure to continue. To posess our foufi in patience is, at once, our wisdom as men, and our duty as Chriflians. The benefits of this virtue are so often reaped in this world, that good policy alone would recommend it to every thinking man. Disappointments derange, and overcome, vulgar minds. The patient and the wife, by a proper improvement, frequently make them contribute to their their high advantage.-Let me next recommend, "
"III. PATIENCE under relfraints. Numerous are the restraints imposed on us, by the nature of the human condition. To the restraints of authority and law, all must submit. The reitraints of education and discipline lie on the young. Conliderations of health reitrain the indulgence of pleasure. Attentions to fortune reitrain expence. Regard to friends, whom we are bound to please; refped to eftablifled cultoms, and to the opinions of society, impose restraints on our general behaviour."
"There is no man, in any rank of life, who is always at liberty to aft according as he would incline. In some quarter or other, he is limited by circumstances, that either actually confine, or that ought at least to confine and restrain him."
"These restraints, the impatient are apt to fcor. They will needs burst the barriers which reason had ereced, or their fituajion had formed; and without regard to Q 3 consequences, "
". conlleqlences, give free scope to their preX'i_. ent wish. Hence, many dangerous excedfes flow; much confusion and misery are produced in human life. Had men the patience to submit to their condition, and to wait till it thould allow them a freer indulgence of their desires, they might, in a short time, obtain the power of gratifying them with lafety. If the young, for instance, would undergo, with patience, the labours of education, they would rife, at a proper period, to honours, riches, or ease. If the infirm would, with patience, bear the regulations which their constitution demands, they might regain the comforts of health. If persons of firaitened fortune had patience to conform themselves to their circumstances, and to abridge their pleasures, they might, by degrees, improve and advance their tlate. Whereas, by eagerness of temper, and precipitancy of indulgence, they forfeit all the advantages which patience would have procured ; and incur the opposite evils to their full extent, "
"IN IN the present state of human affairs, "
"no leflbn is more necessary to be learned __."
"by all, to be inculcated on the young, and to be practised by the old, than that of patient fubmiflion to necessity. For under the law of necessity, we are all inevitably placed. No man is, or can be, always his own matter. We are obliged, in a thousand cafes, to submit and obey. The difcipline of patience preserves our minds eafy, by conforming them to our state. By the impetuosity of an impatient and unsubmitting temper, we fight against an unconquerable power; and aggravate the evil we muit endure.-Another important exerci of the virtue concerning which we discourse, is, "
"IV. PATIENCE under injuries and wrongs. To these, amidst the present confusion of the world, all are exposed. No itation is so high, no power so great, no charater so unblemiihed, as to exempt men from being attacked by ralhnefs, malice, or envy. To behave under such atQ 4 tacks ERM. tacks with due patience and moderation, _, is, it mutt be confcllcd, one of the molt trying exercises of virtue.-But, in order to prevent nlitakes on this fubjecc, it is necessary to observe, that a tame uibmifsion to wrongs is not required by religion.
We are, by no rmeang, to imagine, that religion tends. to extinguilh the sense of honour, or to fiuppirc the exertion of a manly pirit. It is under a falle apprehension of this kind, that Christian patience is sometimes ftigmatilfd in discourse, as no other than a different name for cowardice.
On the contrary, every man of virtue 6ught to feel what is due to his characer, and to support properly his own rights.
Resentment of wrong, is an useful principle in human nature; and for the wileft purposes, was implanted in our frame. It is the necessary guard of private rights; and the great restraint on the insolence of the violent, who, if no resistance were made, would trample on the gentle and peaceable.

Resentment, however, if not kept within in due bounds, is in hazard of rising into SERIB.
fierce and cruel revenge. It is the office of XL patience, to temper relfntment by reason.
In this view, it is moll properly described in the text, by a man pofierJig his Joul; acting the part which felf-defence, which juffice, or honour, require him to act, without being transported out of himself by the vehemence of anger; or insisting on such degrees of reparation as bear no proportion to the wrong that he has suffered. What proportion, for instance, is there between the life of a man, and an affront received by some rash expression in conversation, which the wife would have flighted; and which, in the course of a few weeks, would have been forgotten by every one ? How fantastic, then, how unjustifiable, are those supposed laws of modern honour, which for such an affront, require no less reparation than the death of a fellow-creature; and which, to obtain this reparation, require a man to endanger his own life?
Laws, which as they have no foundation in reason, never received the least fanAion from BERM. from any of the wife and polished nations XjI_ of antiquity; but were deviled in the darkcft ages of the world, and are derived to us from the ferocious barbarity of Gothic manners.

Nothing is so inconsistent with felf-pofsession as violent anger. It overpowers reason; confounds our ideas; distorts the appearance, and blackens the colour, of every object. By the storm which it raifcs within, and by the mischiefs which it occafions without, it generally brings on the pallionate and revengeful man, greater mifery than he can bring on his enemy. Patience allays this deftrufive tempest, by making room for the return of calm and fober thought. It suspends the blow which sudden resentment was ready to inflict. It disposes us to attend to the alleviating circumftances, which may be discovered in the midst of the wrongs we suppose ourselves to have suffered. Hence, it naturally inclines us to the moderate and gentle  and while it allows all proper meafures to be taken, both for safety, and for just just redress, it makes way for returning 

peace. Without some degree of patience exercised under injuries, human life would be rendered a state of perpetual hofility; offences and retaliations would succeed to one another in endless train; and the world would become a field of blood.-It now remains to recommend,   PATIENCE under adversity and asflition. This is the moil common sense in which this virtue is understood; as it refpeds difeaie, poverty, old age, loss of friends, and the other calamities which are incident to human life. Tbozgh a man live many years, and rejoice in them all, yet let him remember the days of darkncfs, for they shall be many *. The various duties to which patience, under this view, gives rife, afford a larger subjeC to discourse than I am at present to pursue. In general, there are two chief exercises of patience under adversity; one refpe God, and another rcfpeCing men.

Patience, with refped to God, must, in in the days of trouble, suppress the risings of a murmuring and rebellious spirit. It must appear in that calm resignation to the will of Heaven, which is expressed in those pious sentiments of ancient good men: I was dumb; I opened not my mouth, beerafe Ibou did it. It is the Lord, let him do what Jfemetb good in his eyes. Shall we receive good at the band of the Lord, and Jhall we not receive evil aljo ? This is loyalty to the great Governor of the universe. This is that reverence which so well becomes creatures who know they are dependent, and who must confess themlrlves to be linful.
Such a spirit is fitted to attract the favour of Heaven; and to bring the revere vifitation sooner to a close. Whereas the stubborn and impatient, who submit not themselves to the decrees of the Most High, require to be humbled and subdued by a continuance of chastisement.

Patience in adversity, with refped to men, mulf appear by the composure and tranquillity of our behavieor. The -loud complaint, 
complaint, the querulous temper, and fret- SER ful spirit, disgrace every character. They i._ [how a mind that is unmanned by misfortunes. We weaken thereby the sympathy of others; and estrange them from the ofsices of kindness and comfort. The exertions of pity will be feeble, when it is mingled with contempt. At the fame time, by thus weakly yielding to adversity, we allow its weight to bear us down with double pressure. Patience, by preserving composure within, refifis the impression which trouble makes from without. By leaving the mind open to every consolation, it naturally tends to alleviate our burden.
-To maintain a steady and unbroken mind, amidst all the hlocks of the world, forms the highest honour of a man. Pa.
tience, on such occations, rifes to magna.
nimity. It ihows a great and noble mind, which is able to reft on itself, on God, and a good conscience; which can enjoy itself amidst all evils; and would rather endure the greatest hardihips, than submit to what was diihonourable, in order to obtain re lief. This gives proof of a strength that is derived from Heaven. It is a beam of the Immortal Light, shining on the heart.
Such patience, is the most complete triumph of religion and virtue; and accordingly it has ever charaderifed those whole names have been tranfinitted with honour to pofterity. It has ennobled the hero, the faint, and the martyr. We arc troubled on tevry  yet not diflrejed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not fjrfaken; cafi down, but not deIlroyed *.

THUS I have traced Patience through several of its moft,important operations, in different circumstances of life; under provocations; under disappointments; under restraints; under injuries; and under asflictions. We now fee, that it is a virtue of universal use. No man, in any condition, can pass his days with tolerable comfort, who has not learned to practise it.
His prosperity will be continually disturb* Cor.  8. 9.

  and his adversity will be clouded with double darkness. He will be uneasy and _ troublesome to all with whom he is conneted ; and will be more troublesome to himself than to any other.- Let me particularly advise those who wiflh to cultivate so necessary a virtue, to begin their cultivation of it, on occasions when small offences and provocations arise. It is a great, but common, error to imagine, that we are at liberty to give loose reins to temper, among the trivial occurrences of life.
No excuse for irritation and impatience can be worse, than what is taken from the person being inconsiderable, or the incident being flight, which threw us off our guard.
With inconsiderable persons we are furrounded. Of flight incidents, the bulk of human life is composed. In the midst of there, the ruling temper of the mind is formed. It is only by moderation and selfcommand then acquired, that we can inure ourselves to patience, when the great conjunCtures of life shall put it to a feverer trial. If neglected then, we {hall afterwards SERM wards solicit its return in vain. If tbou _ bhaft run with footmen, and they have wearied tbce, bow cans thbou contend with borsei and if in the land of peace, wherein thou ruftedfq, they wearied thee, then bow wilt thou do in tbe swellings of ordan * ?

wI order to assist us in the acquisition of this grace, let us often contemplate that great model of it, which is displayed in the whole life of our Saviour Jesus Christ.
Whose temper was ever tried by more frequent provocations, more repeated difappointments, more flagrant injuries, or more severe distress ? Yet, amidst them all, we behold him patiently enduring the contradilion offinners; to their rudeness, opposing a mild and unruffled, though firm, spirit; and, in the cause of mankind, generoufly bearing with every indignity. Well might he fay, Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart  Having such a high example before our eyes, let us be afiamed Jer. iii 5. Matth. xi. 29.

Of of those sallies of impatience which we so SER often susser to break forth, in the midst of   prosperity. By a more manly tranquillity and felf-command, let us discover to the world, that, as men, and as Christians, we have learned in patience to pclefi our fouls.

# SERMON XII. On MODERATION. PHILLIPPIANS,  5. Let your Moderation be known unto all Men. 






PHILLIPPIANS,  
Let your Moderation be knuon unto all Men.
sERM. THE present slate of man is neither doomed to conltant misery, nor designed for complete happiness. It is, in general, a mixed state, of comfort and Torrow, of profpcrity and adversity; neither brightened by uninterrupted sunshine, nor overcatl with perpetual ihade; but subjet to alternate fucceilions of the one, and the other. While such a fate forbids despair, it also checks presumption. It is equally adverse to depondency of mind, and to high high elevation of spirits. The temper which best suits it, is expreffe4 ni the text by mao-  deration; which, as the habitual tenor of the foul, the apostle exhorts us to discover in our whole conduc; let it be known unto all men. This virtue consists in the equal balance of the fouL It imports such proper government of our pafions and pleafures, as {hall prevent us from running into extremes of any kind; and shall produce a calm and temperate frame of mind.
It chiefly refpets our conduct in that tate, which comes under the description of ease, or prosperity. Patience, of which I treated in the preceding discourse, direts the proper regulation of the mind, under the disagreeable incidents of life. Moderation determines the bounds within which it should remain, when circumitances are a.
greeable or promising. What I now purpose is, to point out some of the chief instances in which Moderation ought to take place, and to how the importance of preserving it.


 I. MODERATION in our wimtes. The XI. active mind of man seldom or never refts satisfied with its present condition, how prosperous soever. Originally formed for a wider range of objects, for a higher sphere of enjoyments, it finds itself, in every situation of fortune, straitened and confined. Sensible of deficiency in its state, it is ever fending forth the fond desire, the aspiring wish, after something beyond what is enjoyed at present. Hence, that restlessnefa which prevails so generally among mankind. Hence, that disgust of pleasures which they have tried; that palfion for novelty; that ambition of rising to some degree of eminence or felicity, of which they have formed to themselves an indiftin& idea. All which may be confidered as indications of a certain native, original greatness in the human foul, swelling beyond the limits of its present condition; and pointing at the higher objects for which it was made. Happy, if these latent remains of our primitive state served to dired our wishes towards their proper deftination, and to lead us into the path of true .


But in this dark and bewildered state, 
the aspiring tendency of our nature unfortunately takes an opposite direction, and feeds a very misplaced ambition. The flattering appearances which here present themselves to sense; the diftintions which fortune confers; the advantages and pleafures which we imagine the world to be capable of bestowing, fill up the ultimate with of molt men. These are the objets which ingrofs their solitary mulings, and ltimulate their active labours; which warm the brealts of the young, animate the induftry of the middle aged, and often keep alive the pallions of the old, until the very close of life. Assuredly, there is nothing unlawful in our wilhing to be freed from whatever is disagreeable, and to obtain a fuller enjoyment of the comforts of life.
But when there vwithes are not tempered by reason, they arc in danger of precipitating us into much extravagance and folly. Defires and willies are the first iirings of ac  When they become exorbitant, the Xll.
_ whole characer is likely to be tainted. If we susser our fancy to create to itself, worlds of ideal happiness; if we feed our imagination, with plans of opulence and splendor far beyond our rank; if we fix to our wishes certain stages of high advancement, or certain degrees of uncommon reputation or diftintion, as the sole stations of felicity; the assured consequence will be, that we shall become unhappy in our present state; unfit for a the part, and difcharging the duties that belong to it; we shall discompose the peace and order of our minds, and foment many hurtful paflions.
Here, then, let Moderation begin its reign; by bringing within reasonable bounds the withes that we form. As soon as they become extravagant, let us check them, by proper refleftions on the fallacious nature of those objecs, which the world hangs out to allure dcfire.

You have strayed, my friends, from the road which conducs to felicity; you have diffhontured the native dignity of your fouls, 
founls, in allowing your wishes to terminate . 
on nothing higher than worldly ideas of XIL grcatnefs or happiness. Your imagination roves in a land of lhadows. Unreal forms deceive you. It is no more than a phantom, an illusion of happiness, which attrats your fond admiration; nay, an illusion of happiness, which often conceals much real misery. Do you imagine, that all are happy, who have attained to thole summits of distinction, towards which your wishes aspire ? Alas ! how frequently has experience shewed, that where rotes were supposed to bloom, nothing but briars and thorns grew ? Reputation, beauty, riches, grandeur, nay, royalty itself, would, many a time, have been gladly exchanged by the polfeffors, for that more quiet and humble station, with which you are now diffatif.
sied. With all that is splendid and ihining in the world, it is decreed that there should mix many deep fiades of woe. On the elevated situations of fortune, the great calamities of life chiefly fall. There the Itorm spends its violence, and there the thunder 4 hreaks 6E  breaks; while safe and unhurt, the inhabitXII.

ant of the vale remains below.- Retreat, then, from those vain and pernicious excursions of extravagant desire. Satisfy yourselves with what is rational and attainable.
Train your minds to moderate views of human life, and human happiness. Remember, and admire, the wisdom of Agur with. Remove far from me vanity and lies.
Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me with food convenient for me: Left I be full, and deny thee, and fay, who is the Lord or leIf I be poor, and Jfeal, and take the name of my God in vain *.- Let me recommend,   MODERATION in our pursuits.

Wishes and desires reft within. If immoderate and improper, though they taint the heart, yet society may not be affeced by them. The obscure and harmless individual may indulge his dreams, without (lilhllbl the public peace. But when the active pursuits in which we engage, 
' Prov. xxi. 8. 9.

rife rife beyond moderation, they fill the world with great disorders; often with flagrant i.
crimes. This admonition chiefly relpects the ambitious men of the world. I fay not, that all ambition is to be condemned; or that high pursuits ought, on every occasion, to be checked. Some men are formed by nature, for rising into conspicuous stations of life. In following the impulse of their minds, and properly exerting the talents with which God has blessed them, there is room for ambition to in a laudable sphere, and to become the inltrument of much public good. But this may fafcly be pronounced, that the bulk of men are ready to over-rate their own abilities, and to imagine themselves equal to higher things than they were ever designed for by nature. Be fober, therefore, in fixing your aims, and planning your deftined pursuits. Beware of being led afide from the plain path of found and moderate conduct, by those false lights which felf-flattery is alwa ready to hang out.
1By aiming at a mark too high, you may fall  fall ihort of what it was within your  power to have reached. Instead of attaining to eminence, you may expose yourfelvcs to derision; nay, may bring upon your heads manifold disasters. Ifay to every man that it among you, not to tbink of himfeif more highly than be ought to think, but to think Joberly *.

Whatever your aims be, there is one exercife of moderation which must be enjoined to those of the greatest abilities, as well as to others; that is, never to tranfgrefs the bounds of moral duty. Amidst the warmth of pursuit, accustom yourselves to fuhmit to the retraints, which religion and virtue, which propriety and decency, which regard to reputation and charader, impose. Think not, that there are no barriers which ought to stop your progrefs. It is from a violent and impetuous spirit that all the evils spring, which are so often found to accompany ambition.
Hence, in private life, the laws of truth ' Rom. xii. 3.

and and honour are violated. Hence, in pu- 
blic contests, the peace and welfare of na- .^
tions have been so often sacrificed to the ambitious projects of the great. The man of moderation, as he is temperate in his wilhes, so in his pursuits he is regulated by virtue. A good conscience is to him more valuable than any success. He is not so much bent on the accomplithment of any design, as to take a dishonourable flep, in order to compass it. He can have patience. He can brook disappointments.
He can yield to unsurmountable obstacles; and, by gentle and gradual progress, is more likely to succeed in the end, than others are, by violence and impetuosity. In his highest enterprise, he wiflies not to have the appearance of a meteor, which fires the atmosphere; or, of a comet, which altonithes the public, by its blazing, eccentric course; but rather to resemble those steady luminaries of heaven, which advance in their orbits, with a silent and regular motion. He approves himself thereby to the virtuous, the wife, and discerning i BERM.  and, by a temperate and unexcep tionable condut, escapes those dangers which persons of an opposite deicription are perpetually ready to incur.

III. BE moderate in your expecations.

When your slate is flourilhing, and the courfc of events proceeds according to your wish, susser not your minds to be vainly lifted up. Flatter not yourselves with high profpeds of the increasing favours of the world, and the continuing applause of men.
Say not within your hearts, My mountain flands fprong, and Jhall never be moved. I Jhall never fee adversity. To-morrow Jhall be as this day, and more abundantly.-You are betraying yourselves; you are laying a sure foundation of disappointment and mifery, when you allow your fancy to soar to such lofty pinnacles of confident hope.
By building your house in this airy region, you are preparing for yourselves a great and cruel fall. Your truf/ is the Jbider twb. You may lean on your bouse; but it thall notjiand. You may bold it fai ; but it Jhall Jball not endure. For, to man on earth it 


was never granted, to gratify all his hopes; _ or to perfcvcre in one trad of uninterrupted profpcrity. Unpleafing viciflitudes never fail to succeed those that were grateful.
The fajhion of the world, how gay or fiiling soever, paf'ib, and often pafleth fuddenly, away.

By want of moderation in our hopes, 
we not only increase dejecaion, when difappointment comes, but we accelerate difappointment; we bring forward, with greater speed, disagreeable changes in our state.
For the natural consequence of prefumptuous expectation, is raihnefs in condut.
He who indulges confident security, of course neglects due precautions against the dangers that threaten him; and his fall will be foreseen, and predited. He not only exposes himself unguarded to dangers, but he multiplies them against himself. By presumption and vanity, he either provokes enmity, or incurs contempt.

The arrogant mind, and the proud hope, are equally contrary to religion, and to ERM. to prudence. The world cannot bear such XIL a spirit; and Providence seldom fails to check it. The Almighty beholds with difpleasure those who, intoxicated with profperity, forget their dependence on that Supreme Power which raised them up. His awful government of the world has been in nothing more conspicuous than in bringing low the lofty looks of man, and seatering the proud in the imaginations of their minds.
-Is not this the great Babylon which I have built by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majesty * ? Thus exclaimed the presumptuous monarch, in the pride of his heart. But, lo! when the word was yet in his mouth, the visitation from heaven came, and the voice was heard; 0, Nebuchadnezzar! to thee it is spoken; thy kingdom is departed from thee.-He that exaltetb bimfelf, Jhall be humbled; and be that humblethb imfef, Jball be exalted  A temperate spirit, and moderate expectations, are the best safeguard of the mind in this Danid,  3. 31.

uncertain uncertain and changing state. They en- SF.RM.
able us to pals through life with most XII.
comfort. When we rife in the world, they contribute to our elevation; and if we must fall, they render our fall the lighter.
  MODERATION in our pleasures is an important exercise of the virtue which we are now confidering. It is an invariable law of our present condition, that every pleasure which is pursued to excels, converts itself into poison. What was intended for the cordial and refreshment of human life, through want of moderation, we turn to its bane. In all the pleasures of sense, it is apparent, that only when indulged within certain limits, they confer fatisfation. No sooner do we pass the line which temperance has drawn, than pernicious effects come forward, and flow themselves. Could I lay open to your view the monuments of death, they would read a leture in favour of moderation, much more powerful than any that the most eloquent preacher can gie. You would behold BERM. hold the graves peopled with the victims   of intemperance. You would behold those chambers of darkness hung round, on every  with the trophies of luxury, drunkennefs, and sensuality. So numerous would you find those martyrs of iniquity, that it may safely be asserted, where war or peftilence have lain their thousands, intemperate pleasure has slain its ten thousands.

While the want of moderation in pleasure brings men to an untimely grave, at the fame time, until they arrive there, it pursues and afflicA them with evils innumerable. To what cause so much as to this, are owing, faded youth, and premature old age; an enervated body, and an enfeebled mind; together with all that long train of diseases, which the indulgence of appetite and sense have introduced into the world? Health, chearfulness, and vigour, are known to be the offspring of temperance. The man of moderation brings to all the natural and innocent pleasures of life, that found uncorrupted relili, which gives him a much fuller fullzr enjoyment of them, than the pallcd qs .RM.


and vitiated appetite of the voluptuary al- _, lows him to know. He culls the flower of every allowable gratification, without dwell upon it until the flavour be loft He taftes the ifvezt of every pleaflre, without pursuing it till the bitter dregs rife. Whereas the man of opposite charaacr dips so deep, that he never fails to stir an impure and noxious sediment, which lies at the bottom of the cup. -In the plcafures, besides, which are regulated by moderation, there is always that dignity which goes along with innocence. No man needs to be alhamed of them. They are confitent with honour; with the favour of God, and of man. But the sensualist, who difdains all restraint in his pleasures, is odious in the public eye. His vices become gross; his charader, contemptible; and he ends in being a burden both to himself and to society. Let me exhort you, once more,   To moderation in all your passions.
This exercise of the virtue is the more re4  III. guifite, 
 quifite, because there is no passion in hu-Lvj man nature but what has, of itself, a tendency to run into excess. For all passion implies a violent emotion of mind.. Of course, it is apt to derange the regular course of our ideas; and to produce confusion within. Nothing, at the fame time, is more seducing than paflion. During the time when it grows and swells, it constantly justifies, to our apprehenlion, the tumult which it creates, by means of a thousand false arguments which it forms, and brings to its aid. Of some passions, such as anger and resentment, the excess is so obviously dangerous, as loudly to call for moderation. He who gives himself up to thl impetuofty of such passions, without retraint, is universally condemned by the world; and hardly accounted a man of found mnind. But, what is less apt to be attended to, some even of those passions which arc reckoned innocent, or whose tendency to disorder and evil is not apparent, fland, nevertheless, in need of moderation and refwaint, as well as others. For, such is the ,  .*~~ ~feeblenelf feebleness of our nature, that every padfion which has for its object any worldly good, XIL is in hazard of attaching us too strongly, and of transporting us beyond the bounds of reason. If allowed to acquire the full and unrestrained dominion of the heart, it is futdicient, in various situations, to render us miserable; and almost in every fituation, by its ingrofling power, to render us negligent of dutes which, as men or Chriltians, we are bound to perform.

Of the insidious growth of passion, theiefore, we have great reason to beware. We ought always to have at hand confiderations, which may ailift us in tempering its warmth, and in regaining poffeflion of our fouls. Let us be persuaded, that moments of paflion are always moments of delusion; that nothing truly is, what it then seems to be.; that all the opinions which we then form, are erroneous; and all the judgements which we pass, are extravagant. Let moderation accustom us to wait until the fumes of pafflion be spent; until the milt which it has raised begin to be diipatcd.
 2 We  We lhall then be able to fee where truth XI aand right lie; and reason shall, by degrees, 
resume the ascendant. On no occasion let us imagine, that strength of mind is shown by violence of paflion. This is not the strength of men, but the impetuosity of children. It is the strength of one who is in the delirium of a fever, or under the disease of madness. The strength of such a person is indeed increased. But it is an unnatural strength; which being under no proper guidance, is direced towards objeas that occasion his deftruifon. True strength of mind is 1hown in governing and refiffing passion, not in giving it scope; in restraining the wild beast within; and a  on the most trying occasions, according to the dictates of conscience, and temperate reason.

THUS I have pointed out, in several instances, how moderation ought to be difplayed: Moderation in our withes; moderation in our pursuits; moderation in our hopes; moderation in our pleasures; 
moderation moderation in our passions. It is a prin- 

XYrI ciple which should habitually influence our Lx.
conduct, and form the reigning temperature of the obul.

TlHE great motive to this virtue is suggested by the words immediately following the text; the Lord is at band. The Judge is coming, who is to close this temporary scene of things, and to introduce a higher slate of exitence. The day is at hand, which will place the great concerns of men in a point of view very different from that in which they are at present beheld; will itrip the world of its false glory; will detect the vanity of earthltr pursuits; and disclose objecs which have the proper title to interest a rational mind. Objeds acquire power to engage our paflions, only in proportion as they arc conceived to be great. But great, or little, are no more than terms of conlparifon. Those things which appear great to one who knows nothing greater, will fink into a diminutive size, when he becomes acquainted with objects of a highS 3 er Rk  er nature. Were it oftener in our thoughts, 11I that the Lord is at hand, none ot thoie things which now difcorlmofe and agitacc worldly men, would appear of sufficient magnitude to raise commotion in our breasts. Enlarged views of the future deftination of man, and of the place which he may hope to possess in an eternal world, naturally give birth to moderation of mind. They tend to cool all mifplaced ardour about the advantages of this Rate; and to produce that calm and temperate frame of spirit, which becomes men and Christians. They give no ground for entire disregard of earthly concerns. While we are men, we must feel and aat as such.
But they afford a good reason why they who believe the Lord to be at band, Should let their moderation appear, and be known unto all men.

On the JoY, and the BITTERNESS of the HEART.

PROVERBS, xiv. 1o.

rbe heart knowctb his own bitrcn:cfs, and a Jlranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.
 is well known, that men have always been much inclined to place their hap- _piness in the advantages of fortune, and the diftintions of rank. Hence these have been pursued by the multitude with such avidity, that every principle of honour, probity, and virtue, have been sacrificed to the attainment of them. At the fame time, many circumitances might have convinced men, that supposing them to be fucS 4 ccfsful BERM. celsful in the pursuit, it by no means followed, that happinels was to be the reward. For if happiness be, in truth, esfentially conneced with splendid fortune, or exalted rank, how comes it to pass, that many in the inferior stations of life, visibly spend their days with more comfort, than they who occupy the higher departments of the world ? Why does the beggar ting, while the King is fad ? A small meature of refiection on our nature might latist- us, that there are other principles of happiness or miftry, too often overlooked by the world, which immediately affect the heart, and operate there with greater force and power, than any circumitances of rank or fortune. This is the oblervation of the wile man in the text; and what I now purpose to illulrate. I ilall take a view of the chief fourccs of that biJttrnefi which the I,'rt niwetlh, and of that joy with uhicb I IJrainger diIilh nlt inlermcdd ; and then lhall point out the proper improvements to be made of the subject.

IF IF we inquire carefully into the sources 
of the joy or bitterness of the heart, we ,i., Ihall find, that they are chiefly two; that they arise either from a man own mind and temper; or, from the connection in which he stands with tome of his fellowcreatures. In other words, the circumstances which molt essentially affect every man happiness are, his peribnal character, and his iocial feelings.

I. EVERY man own mind and temper is, necessarily, to himself a iource of much inward joy or bitterness. For every man, if we may be allowed the exprelfion, is more connected with himself, than with any external object. He is constantly a companion to hitnilf in his own thoughts; and what he meets with there, must, of all things, contribute most to his happiness or his difiluiet. Whatever his condition in the world be, whether high or low, if he find no cauie to upbraid himlelf for his bchaviour; if he be satisfied that his conducl procecds upon a rational plan; if, 
amidst  amidt the failings incident to humanity, xM. his confiience be, in the main, free from reproach, and his mind undilturbed by any dilmal presages of futurity; the foundation is laid for a placid and agreeable tenor of life. If to this you add a calm and chearful temper, not easily fretted or difturbed, not lubjed to envy, nor prone to violent pallion, much of that joy will be produced, which it is said in the text, a flranger intermeddleth not with. For this is an intrinsic joy, independent of all foreign causes. The upright man, as it is written, is fatisid from hbnimlf. Undisturbed by the vexations of folly, or the remorse of guilt, his nights will be peaceful, and his days serene. His mind is a kingdom to itself. A good conscience, and good temper, prepare, even in the midlft of poverty, a contiwnalfeqft.

But how sadly will the scene be reversed, 
if the firit thoughts which occur to a man concerning himself, shall be of a gloomy and threatening kind; if his tcmptr, infead of calmness and felf-enjoyment, shall yield yield him nothing but disquiet and painful 
agitation ? In any situation of fortune, is _, it possible for him to be happy, whose mind is in this troubled state ? The spirit of a man will fiflain his ifirmities; but a wounded Jpirit, who can bear ? Vigour of mind, may enable a man to sustain many shocks of adversity. In his spirit, as long as it is found, he can find a resource, when other auxiliaries fail. But if that which should sustain him be enfeebled and broken; if that to which he has recourse for the cure of other sorrows, become itself the wounded part; to what quarter can he turn for relief?

The wounds which the spirit suffers are owing chiefly to three causes; to folly, to paflion, or to guilt. They frequently originate from folly; that is, from vain, and improper pursuits, which, though not dire&ly criminal, are unsuitable to a man age, character, or condition, in the world.
In consequence of these, he beholds himself degraded and exposed; and suffers the pain of many a mortifying refletion, and many ERM . many a humbling comparison of himself XslL. with others. The dittrels occalioncd by a sense of folly, is aggravated by any violent pailon being allowed to take policlion of the heart. Even though it be of the class of those which are reckoned innocent, yet, if it have entirely leizcl and overpowered ; man, it deltroys his tranquillity, and brings his mind into a perturbed state.
But if it be a passion of the black and vicious kind, it is futficient to blast the most flouriihing condition, and to poison all his joys. If to thole wounds infliced by folly, or by passion, you add the wound of guilt, the remorie and fear produced by criminal deeds, you fill up the measure of pain, and bitterness of heart. Often have the terrors of conscience occasioned inward paroxyfins, or violent agitations of mind.
A dark a nd threatening cloud teems, to the conicious linner, to be hanging over his head. He who believes himself despised, or hated, by men, and who dreads, at the fane time, an avenging God, can derive little pleasure from the external comforts of life.

life. The bitterness of his heart infufcs itself into every draught which pleaiure of- i sers to his lips.

The external misfortunes of life, difapi pointments, poverty, and sickness, are nothing in comparison of those inward difireffes of mind, occasioncd by folly, by pallion, and by guilt. They may indeed prevail in different degrees, according as one or other of those principles of bitternets is predominant. But they are seldom parted far asunder from one another; and when, as it too often happens, all the three are complicated, they complete the misery of man. The disorders of the mind, having then arisen to their height, become of all things the moll dreadful. The ihame of folly, the violence of passion, and the remorse of guilt, acting in conjunction, have too frequently driven men to the last and abhorred refuge, of seeking relief in death from a life too embittered to be any longer endured. I proceed to confider  OTHER troubles, and other joys of the  the heart, arising from Iburces different . . from those that I have now described; 
founded in the relations or connecdions which we have with others, and springing from the feelings which there occifion.
Such causes of sorrow or joy are of an external nature. Religion does not teach, that all the Iburces of inward pleasure or pain are derived from our temper, and moral behaviour. These are indeed the principal springs of bitterness or joy. In one way or other, they asset all the pleasures and pains of life; but they include not, within themselves, the whole of them. Our Creator did not intend, that the happinels of each individual should have no dependence on those who are around him. Having connected us in society by many ties, it is his decree, that there ties should prove, both during their subsistence, and in their dissolution, causes of pleasure or pain, immediately, and often deeply, affecting the human heart. My dotrine, therefore, is not, that the bitternef wubicb the heart knoweth as it: own, and the joy with which a ralnger 5franger intermeddkflh *ot, is independent of  1 every thing external. What I assert is, .
that this bitternefi, and this jy', depend much more on other causes, than on riches or poverty, on high or low itations in the world; that, equally in the conditions of elevated fortune, and of private life, the moOt material circumstances of tronble or felicity, next to the [Fate of our own mind and temper, are the ienfations and assections which arise from the connetions we have with others.

IN order to make this appear, let us sup.

pose a man, in any rank or condition of life, happy in his family and his friends; soothed by the cordial intercourse of kind affections, which he partakes with them; enjoying the comfort of doing them good offices, and receiving in return their sincereft gratitude; experiencing no jealousy nor envy, no disquiet or alienation of asfction, among those with whom he is connected ;- how many, and how copious sources of invward joy open to such a man How RM. How finooth is the tenor of a life that proI__I ceeds in such a course! What a smiling asped does the love of parents and children, of brothers and fillers, of friends and relations, give to every surrounding objet, and every returning day ! With what a lutfre does it gild even the small habitation where such placid intercourse dwells; where such scenes of heartfelt satisfaction succeed uninterruptedly to one another!

But let us suppose this joyful intercourse to be broken off, in an untimely hour, by the cruel hand of the last foe; let us imagine the family, once so happy among themselves, to behold the parent, the child, or the spouse, to whom their hearts were attached by the tendereft ties, stretched on the cold bed of death; then, what bitterness does the heart know ! This, in the ftri'teft sense, is its own bitterness; from which it is not in the power of any external circumstance whatever to afford it relief. Amidst those piercing griefs of the heart, all ranks of life are levelled; all diftin&tions of fortune are forgotten. Unavailing availing arc the trophies of splendid woe, 
with which riches deck the fatal couch, to _ _'
give the leaf comfort to the mourner. The prince, and the peasant, then equally feel their own bitterness. Dwelling on the melancholy remembrance of joys that arc past and gone, the one forgets his poverty; the other despises the gilded trappings of his ltate. Both, in that fad hour, are fully lenfble, that on the favours of fortune it depends not to make man happy in this world.

But it is not only the death of friends, 
which, in the midst of a seemingly profperous state, is able to bring diitrefs home to the heart. From various failures in their conduct when living, arises much of the inward uneasiness we susser. It will, in general, be found, that the behaviour of those among whom we live in near connection, is, next to personal charater and temper, the chief source, either of the pleafures, or of the disquietudes, of every man life. As, when their behaviour is cordial and fatisfacory, it is of all external things  ll. the  the inof soothing to the mind ; so, on the XIII.
Lry-- other hand, their levity, their inattention, 
or occasional harllnefs, even though it proceed to no deciled breach of fricndflip, yet ruffles and sirets the temper. Social life, harassed with those petty vexations, resembles a road which a man is doomed daily to travel; but finds it rugged, and flony, and painful to be trod.

The cafe becomes much worst, if the base and criminal conduc of perfins whom we have once loved, dissolve all the bonds of amity, and flow that our confidence has been abused. Then are opened, some of the dccpelt springs of bitterness in the human heart. - Behold the heart of the parent, torn by the unworthy behaviour, and cruel ingratitude of the child, whom lie had trained up with the fondest hopes; on whom he had laviflied his whole assection ; and for whoe fake lie had laboured and toiled, through the course of a long life.
Behold the endearments of the conjugal slate changed into black suspicion, and miftrust; the affeclionate spouse, or the virtuous tuous husband, left to mourn, with a bro- 
ken heart, the infidelity of the once-beloved  
partner of their life. Behold the unfifpecing fiiend betrayed, in the hour of danger, by the friend in whom he trulted; or, in the midst of severe misfortune, meeting nothing but cold indifference, perhaps scorn and contempt, where he had expeted to find the kindest fvmpathy.- Are these, let me ask, uncommon scenes in the world ? Are such distresses peculiar to any rank or station ? Do they chiefly befall persons in humble life, and have the great any prerogative which affords them exemption ? When the heart is sorely wounded by the ingratitude or faithleffilefs of those on whom it had leaned with the whole'
weight of affection, where shall it turn for relief? Will it find comfort in the recollection of honours and titles, or in the contemplation of surrounding treafurcs ?-.Talk not of the honours of a court. Talk not of the wealth of the east. These, in the hours of hcart-bitternefs, are spurned, as contemptible and vile; perhaps cursed,  2 as  as indireA causes of the present difrefi.
Xli. The dart has made its way to the heart.

There, there, it is fixed. The very feat of feeling is assailed; and in proportion to the sensibility of the sufferer heart, and the tenderness of his affecions, such, unfortunately, will be his degree of anguiih.
A good conscience, and hope in God, may indeed bring him consolation. But under such distresses of the heart, as I have described, fortune, be it as flourishing as you will, is no more than an empty pageant. It is a feeble reed, which affords no support. It is a house of straw, which is scattered before the wind.

THUS you fee this dodrine meeting us from many quarters, that the heart knows a bitterness and a joy of its own, altogether diffind from tie uneasiness or the pleasure that is produced by the circumstances of external fortune; arising either from perfonal character, and the state of a. man own mind; or from the affecions excited by the relations in which he stands to others.

This This joy, and this bitterness, are, each of 
them, of so much greater consequence than _ any diftintions of fortune, that blessed with the former, one may be happy, as far as human happiness goes, in a cottage; and afflided with the latter, he must be miserable in a palace.- Let us now proceed to an important part of the subject, the practical improvement to which this doctrine leads.

FIRST, Let it serve to moderate our passion for riches, and high situations in the world. It is wel known, that the eager pursuit of these is the chief incentive to the crimes that fill the world. Hence, among the middle and lower ranks of men, all the fraud, falsehood, and treachery, with which the competition for gain infeCts society.
Hence, in the higher stations of the world, all the atrocious crimes flowing fiom ambition, and the love of power, by which the peace of mankind has so often been broken, and the earth stained with blood.
Had tlhee coveted advantages the power,  3 when  when obtained, of ensuring joy to the XIII  heart, and rendering it a stranger to bitterness, some apology might be offered for the violence to which they have given occafion. The prize might be supposed worthy of being acquired at a high expence, when so much depended on the attainment. But I have Ihown, I hope with fatisfaAory evidence, that the contrary is the truth. I fay not, that the advantages of fortune deserve no regard from a wife or a good man. Poverty is always distressing.
Opulence and rank are both attended with many comforts, and may be rendered subservient to the most valuable purposes. But what I fay is, that it is a great error to rate them beyond their just value. Secondary advantages, inferior afliftances to felicity, they are; and no more. They rank below every thing that immediately assets the heart; and that is a native source of joy or bitterness there. If a man be either unhappy in his dispositions, or unhappy in all his connecions, you heap upon him in vain, all the treaiures, and all the honours, 
which which kings can bcetow. Divest thef ERM.
things, then, of that fallc glare which the i opinions of the multitude throw around them. Contemplate them with a more impartial eye. Iurlle them with less cagernels. Above all, never sacrifice to the pursuit any degree of probity or moral worth, of candour or good affetion; if you would not lay a foundation for that bitterness of heart, which none of the goods of fortune can either compensate or cure.

SECONDLY, Let the observations which have been made, correct our mistakes, and check our complaints, concerning a fuppoled promiscuous diltribution of happiness in this world. The charge of injustice, which lb often, on this account, bath been brought againit Providence, refts entirely on this ground, that the happiness and mifery of men may be eflimated by the degree of their external proiperity. This is the delusion under which the multitude have always laboured; but which a just consideration of the invisible springs of hapT 4 piness SER piness that affcl the heart, is sufficient to xii. cjrrc. If you would judge whether a man be really happy, it is not solely to bi1 houses and his lands, to his equipage and lus retinue, you are to look. Unless you could fee farther, and discern what joy, or what bitterness, his heart feels, you can pronounce nothing concerning him. That proud and wicked man, whom you behold lurrounded with Uate and splendour, and upon whom you think the favours of Heaven so improperly lavilhed, may be a wretch, pining away in lecret, with a thousand griefs unknown to the world. That poor man, who appears negleted and overlooked, may, in his humble station, be partaking of all the moral, and all the social joys, that exhilarate the heart; may be living chearful, contented, and happy.
Cease, then, to murmur against difpenfations of Providence, which are, to us, tb imperfedly known. Envy not the prosperity of finners. Judge not of the real condition of men, from what floats. merely on the surface of their state. Let  rather, 

THIRDLY, Turn our attention to those 
internal sources of happiness or misery, on XII.
which it hath been Ihown that fb much depends. As far as the bitterness or joy of the heart arises from the first of thoie great springs which I assigned to it, our own conduct and temper, so far our happiness is placed, in some measure, in our own hands. What is amiss or disordered within, in consequence of folly, of pailion, or guilt, may be rectified by due care, under the afliftance of divine grace. He who thereby attains to a tranquil and composed state of heart, free from ill humour and disgust, from violent passions, and from vexing remorse, is laying a foundation for enjoyment of himself, much furer and broader, than if he were amafing thousands to increase his estate.

With regard to the other spring of joy or bitterness of heart, arising from our connections with others, here indeed, we are more dependent on things not within our power. These connections are not always of our own forming; and even when they  they have been formed by choice, the wisest JXII. are liable to be disappointed in their expectations. Yet here too it will be found, that the proper regulation of the heart is of the utmost importance, both for improving the joys which our situation affords, and for mitigating the griefs which our connections may render unavoidable. As far as the choice of friends or relatives depends on ourselves, let their virtue and worth ever dire& that choice, if we look for any lasting felicity from it. In all the habits and attachments of bfcial life, after they are formed, let it be our study, to fulfil properly our own part. Let nothing be wanting on our  to nourith that mutual harmony and affectionate friendship which, in every situation of life, as has been Ihown, is of so great consequence to our peace and satisfaction. It is not, indeed, in our power to preserve always alive those friends, in whom our hearts delight. It is often not in our power to prevent the ingratitude and unworthy behaviour of other friends, from whom we once expected comfort. But under under those afflicting incidents of life, ER 
much may be done by proper employment xtI.
of the thoughts, and direction of the assections, for obtaining relief. To a purified and well-regulated heart, reason and religion can bring many aids for healing its wounds, and rctoring its peace; aids which, to the negligent and vicious, are wholly unknown. The greater experience we have of the viciflitudes of human life, with more weight will that precept of the wife man always come home to our remembrance; Keep thy heart with all diligence; for ut of it are te iues of lfe *.- Hence arises, 
IN the fourth and last place, another initruction, that it is of the utmost importance to us all, frequently to look up to Him who made the human heart; and to implore his afliftance in the regulation and government of it. Known to him, are all the sources of bitterness and joy by which it is affected. On him it depends, to let Prov. ;>. 23.

them  them forth, or to ihut them up; to inA . crease, or to diminith them, at his pleasure. In a study so infinitely important to happiness, as that of the preservation of inward peace, we cannot be too earnest in beseeching aid from the great Father of Spirits, to enable us to keep our hearts free from distress and trouble.- Besides the assistance which we may hope to derive from divine grace, the employments of devotion tbemfclves, form one of the most powerful means of composing, and tranquillifing the heart. On various occasions, when the sources of heart-bitternefs have been most overflowing, devotion has been found the only refuge of the sufferer. Devotion opens a fanduary, to which they, whose hearts have been most deeply wounded, can always fly. Within that quiet and sacred retreat, they have often found a healing balsam prepared. When grieved by men, they have derived, from the ascent of the mind towards God and celestial objecs, much to tooth them at present, and much to hope for in future. Let us, therefore, neglect no mean with which religion .



can furnith us, for promoting the joys, and afluaging the bitterness of the heart. Amidst the frailties of our nature, the inconftancy of men, and the frequent changes of human life, we shall find every assistance that can be procured, little enough, for enabling us to pass our few days with tolerable comfort and peace.

# SERMON XIV. On CHARACTERS of IMPERFECT GOODNESS. MARK,  21. Then Jesus, beholding him, loved him. 




On CHARACTERS of IMPERFECT GOOD
Then Jesu, beholding him, loved him. . characters of men which the world __ presents to us are infinitely diversificd.

In some, either the good or the bad qualities are so predominant, as firongly to mark the character; to discriminate one person as a virtuous, another as a vicious man.
In others, these qualities are so mixed together, as to leave the character doubtful.
The light and the shade are so much blended, the colours of virtue and vice run in such a manner into one another, that we can can hardly distinguish where the one ends, 


and the other begins; and we remain in __ fufpence, whether to blame or to praise.
While we admire those who are thoroughly good, and detest the grossly wicked, it is proper also to bestow attention on those imperfect characters, where there may be much to praise, and somewhat to blame; and where regard to the commendable part, shall not hinder us from remarking what is defective or faulty. Such attentions will be found the more useful, as characters of this mixed fort are, more frequently than any other, exhibited to us in the commerce of society.

It was one of this fort, which gave occasion to the incident recorded in the text. The incident seems to have been confidered as remarkable, since it is recounted by three of the evangelical writers; and by them all, with nearly the fame circumstances. The person to whom the history relates was a ruler; one of higher rank and station than those who usually resorted to Jesus. He was a rich man: He was a young man. His whole  whole behaviour was prepoflefling and en.
XlV, gaging. He appears to have conceived a high opinion of our Lord. He addrefled him with the utmft refpe and the question which he put to him was proper and importnt. He kneeld to him; andfaid, Good Ma/or, What Jball I do that I may inherit eternal lft His conduct in the world had been regular and decent He could protft, that he had hitherto kept himfeif free from any gross vice; and in his dealings with others, had observed the precepts of God. Our Lord, beholding him, is said to have loved him; whence we have reason to conclude, that he was not hypocritical in his professions; and that his countenance carried the expression of good dispositions, as his speech, and his manners, were altogether complacent and gentle. Yet this person, amiable as he was, when his virtue was put to the test, disappointed the hopes which he had given reason to form. Attached, in all probability, to the indulgence of cafe and pleasure, he wanted fortitude of mind to part with the advantages of the world, 
world, for the fake of reliion. When our sr. 
Lord required him to tultil his good intelltions, by riliinquillling his fortule, becoinig one of his follovcrs, and preparing himllff to encounter uilriilngs, the lacrilice alpcarcd to Iilm too great. Imprclhous of virtue, however, llill remained on his mind. Ile was lenfible of what he ought to have done; and regretted his want of courage to do it. He w7s rJlrro.fil: He war grieved: Yet he wZLnt away.

PERSONS of a character fomcwhat refeinbling this, all of us may have met with; eliecially, among the young; among those who have been liberally educated, and polilhed by good society. They abhor open vice, and crimes that ditlurb the world. They have a refipec for religion.
They are willing to receive initrucion for their conduc. They are modelt and unassuming; rclipcctthl to their superiors in age or station; gentle in their address; inoffenfivc and courteous in their whole behaviour. They are fond of obliging every  III. one;   one; unwilling to hurt or dilpleafe any.
Such persons we cannot but love. We gladly promise well of them; and are difposed to forward and affilt them. Yet such is the weakness of our nature, that at the bottom of this character there may lie, as we fee exemplified in the inttance before us, some secret and material defects. That vigour of mind, that firmness of principle, may be wanting, which is requisite for enabling them to with propriety, when their virtue is put to a decisive trial. The softness of their nature is unfavourable to a feady perseverance in the course of integrity. They possess the amiable qualities; but there is ground to fufped, that in the estimable ones they are deficient. While, therefore, we by no means class them among the bad, we dare not give them the full praiIe of virtue. When they set out in the workl, we cannot pronounce with confidence, what confirmed features their characer will aflume; nor how far they can be depended upon, in future life. Allow me now to point out the dangers which such iuch persons are mos likely to incur; and 8E RM.
to ihow what is requisite for them farther to study, in order to their fulfilling the part of good men and true Christians.

I. PERSONS of this description are not qualified for discharging aright many duties, to which their Sitnation in life may call them. In certain circumstances, they behave with abundance of propriety. When all is calm and smooth around them; when nothing occurs to agitate the mind, or to disturb the tenor of placid life, none of their defects come forward. They are beloved; and they are useful. They promote the comfort of human society; and, by gentleness, and courtesy of manners, serve to cement men together in agreeable union.
But to fail on the tranquil surface of an unruffled lake, and to steer a safe course through a troubled and stormy ocean, require different talents: and alas! human life oftener refernbles the flormy ocean, than the unruffled lake. We shall not have been long embarked, without findU 2  the resemblance to hold too clofcXIV.

Amidst the bustle of the world, amidst the open contentions, and secret enmities, which prevail in every society, mildness and gentleness alone, are not iufficient to carry us, with honour, through the duties of our different stations; as heads of families, citizens, fabjets, magistrates, or as engaged in the pursuits of our several callings. Disturbances and trials arise, which demand vigorous exertions of all the moral powers; of patience, vigilance, and selfdenial; of constancy and fortitude, to support us under danger and reproach; of temperance, to restrain us from being carried away by pleasure; of firm and determined principle, to make us dcfpile the bribes of fin. These manly dispositions of mind are indifpcnfably necessary to prepare one, for surmounting the discouragements of virtue; and for firuggling honourably through the hardships of life. Unless he be thus armed and fortified, whatever good intentions have been in his heart, they are likely likely to be frustrated in ac'ion. Nothing 
that is great, can be undertaken. Nothing *.
that is dificult or hazardous, can be accomplilhed. Nor arc we to imagine, that it is only in times of perlrcution, or war, or civil commotions, that there is occasion for thoie ilronger efforts, tholfe malculine virtues of the ioul, to be displayed. The private, and seemingly quiet, stations of life, often call men forth, in the days of peace, to severe trials of firmness and conflancy.
The life of very few proceeds in so uniform a train, as not to oblige them to discover, in tome situation or other, what portion they possess of the cftimable qualities of man. Hence it lometimes happens, that perlons, whole manners were much less promising and cngaging than thole of others, have, neverthelels, when brought to ac a part in critical circumstances, performed that part with more untillhed honour, and firmer integrity, than they.
  I'ERSONS of the character I have dccribed are ill fitted, not only for dilcharging the higher duties of life, but allb for 3 rcfilting . refiting the common temptations to vice.
X1V. With good dispositions in their mind, with a desire, like the young ruler in the text, to know what they shall do, in order to in.
berit eternal life; yet, when the terms required of them interfere with any favourite enjoyment, like him, they are sorrow.
.fl; and go away. The particular trial to which he was put, may appear to be a hard one, and to exceed the ordinary rate of virtue. Our Lord, who discerned his heart, saw it to be necessary, in his cafe, for bringing his character to the tell. But in cafes, where trials of much less difficulty present themselves, they who partake of a charaCter funilar to his, are often found to give way. The good qualities which they possess, border on certain weaknesses of the mind; and these weaknesses are apt to betray them insensibly into vices, with which they are connected.

Good nature, for instance, is in danger of running into that unlimited complaifance, which assimilates men to the loose manners of those whom they find around them. Pliant, and yielding in their their temper, they have not force to fiand 



by the decisions of their own minds, with regard to right and wrong. Like the animal which is said to assume the colour of every objeft to whlich it is applied, they lose all proper character of their own; and are formed by the characters of those with whom they chance to aflociate.-The mild are apt to fink into habits of indolence and sloth. The chearful and gay, whae warmed by pleasure and mirth, lo that Iobriety and felf-denial, which is elcential to the support of virtue.-Even nodefty and fubmiiion, qualities so valuable in themselves, and so higlly ornamcntal to youth, sometimes 4egenerate into a vicious timidity; a timidity which refirains men from doing their duty with firmness; which cannot stand the frown of tle great, the reproach of the multitude, or even the ridicule and fncer of the icorner.

Nothing can be more amiable than a constant desire to please; and an unwillingness to offend or hurt. Yet in characcrs where this is a predominant feature, fecls are often found. Fond always to obxlv lige, and afraid to utter any disagreeable - truth, fluch persons are lometimes led to dissemble. Their love of truth is lacrificed to their love of pleating. Their speech, and their manners, allune a tfhdied coultefy.
You cannot always depend on their finile; nor, when they promile, be ;ure of the performance. 'They mean and intend well.
But the good intention is tempolrary. Like wax, they yield cafily to every inpreffion; and the transient friendihip contracted with one person, is efli;ccd by the next. Undiftinguilhing dclirc to oblige, often proves, in the pr' lcnt fate of human things, a dangerous: haliit. hey who cannot, on many occalions, give a lirn and steady denial, or who cannot break olf a connecion, which lias i)en hallily and improperly formed, itand on the brink of many mischiefs.
Thec will be ieduced by the corrupting, cnlill'cd by the artful, betrayed by thole iii whom tlhey had placed their trult. UnI'lfpicious thcrnlfilves, they were flattered 'irh the i)licn of havilng many friends around round them. Elated with fmtluine hopes, SERiM.
and chearful fpilits, the, reckoned, that to-  morrow wldi be a this dai), and mnre abunldant. Injudicious liberality, and thoughtlels profulion, are the coniequence; until, in the end, the Illaits to which they are reduced, bring them into mean or diihonourable courses. Through innocent, hut unguarded weakness, and fiom want of the leverer virtues, they are, in proceis of time, betrayed into downright crimes. Such may be the conclusion of those, who, like the young ruler before us, with many amiable and promising dispositions, had begun their career in life.

III. Sucn persons are not prepared for sustaining, with propriety and dignity, the difireflcs to which our (late is liable. They were equipped for the ibafon' of tiinflinc and tl renity ; but whcn the iky is overcall, .nd the days of darkness come, their feeble minds are destitute of Ihclter, and ill provided for defence. Then is the time, when more hardy qualities are required; when courage 8ER  courage must face danger, constancy sup  port pain, patience possess itself in the midst of discouragements, magnanimity dilplay its contempt of threatenings. If those high virtues be altogether llrangers to the mind, the mild and gentle will certainly fink under the torrent of difafters.-The ruler in the text could plead, that his behaviour to others, in the course of social life, had been unexceptionable. So far, the reflection on his conduct would afford him comfort amidst adversity. But no man is without failings. In the dejecting season of trouble, it will occur to every one, that he has been guilty of frequent tranfgreflion; that much of what ought to have been done, was neglected; and that much of what has been done, had better have been omitted. In such situations, when a thousand apprehensions arise to alarm conscience, nothing is able to quiet its uneasiness, except a well-grounded trust in the mercy and acceptance of Heaven. It is firm religious principle, acting upon a manly and enlightened mind, that gives dignity to the character, and composure to the heart, under all the troubles of the world. This enables the brave and virtuous man, with success to buffet the storm. While he, who had once sparkled in society with all the charms of gay vivacity, and had been the delight of every circle in which he was engaged, remains dispirited, overwhelmed, and annihilated, in the evil day.

SUCH are the failings incident to persons of mixed and imperfet goodness: such the defects of a character formed merely of the amiable, without the cftimable qualities of man.

It appears from this, that we must not place too much trust in the fair appearances, which a charater may at first exhibit. In judging of others, let us always think the best, and employ the spirit of charity and candour. But in judging of ourselves, we ought to be more severe. Let us remember him whom our Lord beheld, and lkved; and who yet fell short of the kingdom of heaven. Let us not forget, that loimetllinqg more tlian gentleness and XIV   _, modelty, than complacency of temper and altli'iiity of mantlcr  is requisite to form a worthv man, or a true Chritian. To a hilgh place in our eftecm, these qualities are jultly intitled. They enter cifeitiiall into every good man characfer. They form some of its moll favourable diltinctions.
But they constitutc a part of it; not the whole. Let us not, therefore, rcll on them entirely, when we conceive an idea of what manner of persons we ought to be.

LET piety form the basis of firm and established virtue. If this be wanting, the character cannot be found and entire. Moral virtue will always be endangered, often be overthrown, when it is separated from its lilrelt filpport. Confidence in God, lrcnthlened by faith in the great Redeemer of mankind, not only, amidst the ieverer trials of virtue, gives conitancy to the min  but, by nourilhing the hope of immortality, adds warmth and elevation to the aflec'ions. They whose conduct is not animated animated by religious principle, are deprived of the molt powerful incentive to wor- _ thy and honourable deeds.

Let fich difciplinc, next, be studied, as may form us to the active and manly virtues. To natural good affcctions, we can never entirely trull our conduct. These, as has been llown, may Ibmctimes be warped into what is wrong; and often will prove insufficient, for carrying us rightly through all the duties of life. Good assections are highly valuable; but they mult he flipportcd bv fixed principles, cultivated in the underlianding, and rooted in the heart. lHabits nufi be acquired of temperance and felf-denial, that we may be able to refill pleasure, and endure pain, when either of them interfere with our duty; that we may be prepared to make a facrifice of any worldly interest, when the voice of God and conscience demand it. Let us always remember, that without fortitude of mind, there is no manhood; there can be no perseverance in virtue. Let a tcred and inviolable regard for truth reign in our  our whole behaviour. Let us be diftinxlVJ guilhed for fidelity to every promise we have made; and for constancy in every worthy friendihip we have formed. Let no weak conplailance, no undue regard to the opinions of men, ever make us betray the rights of confcicnce. What we have once, upon due consideration, adopted as rules of conduct, to these let us adhere unlhaken. However the world may change around us, let it find us the fame in profperity and adversity; faithful to God and virtue; faithful to the convidions of our own heart. What our lot in the world may be, is not ours to foresee or determine.
But it is ours to resolve, that whatever it Ihall be, it ihall find us persevering in one line of uprightness and honour.

BY such discipline, such attentions as these, we are to guard against those fail.
ings, which are fibmetimes found to stain the molt engaging characers. Joining in proper union the amiable and the estimable qualities, by the one we fliall attract the good; and by the other, command rcfpec from the bad. We shall both secure our _ own integrity, and fihall exhibit to others a proper view of what virtue is, in its native grace and majesty. In one part of our character, we lhall resemble the flower that smiles in spring; in another, the firmlyrooted tree, that braves the winter storm.
For, remember we mult, that there is a feablo of winter, as well as of spring and summer, in human life; and it concerns us to be equally prepared for both.

A higher and more perfect example of such a character as I now recommend, cannot be found, than what is presented to us in the life of Jesus Christ. In him, we behold all that is gentle, united with all that is refpeftable. It is a remarkable expression, which the Apostle Paul employs concerning him; I befeecb you by the meeknesS and gentlenefi of Chril *. Well might these qualities be singled out, as those for which he was known and diftinguiihed.



We RM. We fee him in his whole behaviour affable, .__, courteous, and ealy or access. He converted familiarly with all who preflnted themselves; and defpiled not the meanett.
With all the infirmities of his disciples he calmly bore; and his rebukes were mild, when their provocations were great. He wept over the calamities of his country, which persecuted him; and apologised and prayed for them who put him to death.
Yet the fame Jesus we behold, awful in the ftridtnefs of his virtue; inflexible in the cause of truth; uncomplying with prevailing manners, when he found them corrupt; setting his face boldly against the hypocritical leaders of the people; overawed by none of their threatenings; in the molt indignant terms, reproving their vices, and itigmatizing their characters.
We behold him gentle, without being tame; firm, without being stern; courageous, without being violent. Let this mind be in us wbich was alo in JeJus Cbrif; and we shall attain to honour, both with God and with man.

# SERMON  On the SACRAMENT of the LORD SUPPER, as a PREPARATION for DEATH. Preached at the Celebration of the Sacrament of the Lord Supper. MATTHEW, xxvi. 29. But I say unto you, I will not drink ...


On the SACRAMENT of the LORD SUPPER, as a PREPARATION for DEATH.
Preched at the Celebration of the Sacrment of the Lord Supper.

MATTHEW, xxvi. 29.

But Ifay unto you, I will not drilk henceforth of tbi fruit of the vine, until that day vwen I. drink it new with you in my Fatber kingdom.
WITH these words of our blesed Lord, the Evangelist concludes his account of the institution of the sacrament of the Supper. It is an institution which, solemn and venerable in itself, is rendered still more so, by the circumstances which accompanied  III. it,   it. Our Lord had now, for about three iL_-_ years, continued 1' appear in his public character, in the land of Judea. He had, all along, been watched with a jealous eye, by his enemies; and tie time was come, when they were to prevail against him. A few friends he had, from lhe, beginning, flec'led, who, in every vicillitude of his tdttc, remained faithfully attached to him.
Witl thele friends he was now meeting for the lail time, on the very evening in which he was betrayed and seized. He perfetly knew all that was to befal him. He knew that this was the last meal in which he was to join with those, who had been the companions of all his labours, the confidedt of all his griefs; among whom he had passed all the quiet and private moments of his life.
He knew, that within a few hours, he was to be torn from this loved society, by a band of ruffians; and by to-morrow, was to be publicly arraigned, as a malefactor With a heart melting with tenderneif, he said to the twelve Apostles, as he fat down with them at table, With defre I have deired te Is eat this pafover with ;'9 befire ftier. 


And then, having gratified himself for the lall time in their fociery, and having inftituted that commemoration of his death which was to continue in the Christian church until the end of ages, he took a solemn and affetionate farewel of his friends, in the words of the text, Ifay unto you, tbat I will not drink bencefirtb of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father kingdom.

As these words were uttered by our Lord, in the profped of his sufferings'; when preparing himself for death, and looking forward to a future meeting with his ends in heaven; let us, under this view; confider the sacrament, which he then intituted, as a preparation for all the sufferings of life, and especially, a preparation for death. It is fit and proper, that such folernn profpeds should enter into the service which we are this day to perform.
We have no reason to imagine, that they * Luik, mii. 15.
 will  will render it a gloomy service. A good _--^_ and wife man is often disposed to look forward to the termination of life. The number of our days is determined by God; and certainly it will not tend to Ihorten their number, that we employ ourselves in preparing for death. On the contrary, while our days last, it will tend to make us pass them more comfortably, and more wifely.
Let us now then, as if for the last time we were to partake of this sacrament, confider how it may serve to prepare us for the dying hour.

I. IT is a high exercise of all those difpofitions and affections, in which a good man would wish to die. He would surely wish to leave this world, in the spirit of devotion towards God, and of fellowflip and charity with all his brethren on earth.
Now, these are the very sentiments, which the sacrament of the Lord Supper inspires into the heart of every pious communicant. It includes the higher ats of devotion of which human nature is capable. It imports, a lively fcnfe of the 
finite mercies ot Heaven; of the gratitude _ .
we owe to that God, who, by the death of his Son, hath reltored the forfeited happiness and hopes of the humlan ce. It imports, the consecration of the foul to Lod; the entire rcfignation of ourlilvcs, and all our concerns, into his hands; as to the God whom we serve and love; the guardian in whom we confide. To thee, 0 Lord, do lift up njmyfol. I willgo to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy. I will come into thy booke in the multitude of thy mercy; and in thy fear, I will worJhip towards thy hol/ temple *.

These devout affecions towards GCod are, 
on this occasion, necetlarily accompanied with benevolent dilpofitions towards men.
Our communion is not only with God, but with one another. In this solemn service, the diitinction of ranks is abolilhcd. We assemble in common before our great Lord, professing ourselves to be all members of his family, and children of the fame Father. No feud, nor strife, nor enrtity, is permitted to approach the sacred table. All within that hallowed space breathes peace, and concord, and love. If thou bring thy gif? to the altar, and Btre rememberrcf that thy brother bath ought agai thee; leav there ehy gift bfore the altar, and go thy way; firfi be reconciled to tby brother; and then come and offer thy gift *. What can be more becoming men and Christians, than such sentiments of piety to the great Father of the univcrfe; gratitude to the merciful Redeemer of mankind; and charity and forgivcnefs towards all our brethren? Is not this the temper in which a good man would wish to live? more especially, is not this the frame of mind which will give both dignity and peace to his last moments? How discomposed and embittered will these important moments prove, if, with a mind toured by the remembrance of unforgiven injuries, with a breast rankled by enmity, with a heart alienated from God, and insensible to devotion, one be forced away from life?


Contemplate Contemplate the manner in which our blessed Lord died; which the lervice of this  day brings particularly into your view.
You behold him, amidit the extremity of pain, calm and collected within himself; poffefiing his spirit with all the fcrenity which sublime devotion, and exalted benevolence inspire. You hear him, first, lamenting the fate of his unhappy country; next, when he was fastened to die cross, addressing words of consolation to his asslided parent; and lastly, fending up prayers, mixed with compaifionate apologies, for those who were Ihedding his blood.
After all those exercises of charity, you behold him in an of devout adoration and trust, resigning his breath; Father, into thy hands I commend myJpirit.- Can any death be pronounced unhappy, how distressful soever its circumstances may be, which is thus supported, and dignified ? What could we wifl for more in our last moments, than with this peaceful frame of mind, this calm of all the afficions, this exaltation of heart 4 towards 8E RM. towards God, this diffusion of benevolence XVY · , towards men, to bid adieu to the world?

If, in such a spirit as this, we would all wish to die, let us think, that now is the time to prepare for it, by seasonably cultivating this spirit while we live; by imbibing, in particular, from the holy sacrament, those dispositions and affecions which we would with to possess at our latest period. It is altogether vain to imagine, that when the hour of death approaches, we ihall be able to form ourselves into the frame of mind which is then mofl proper and decent. Amidit the ftruggles of nature, and under the load of sickness or pain, it is not time for unaccuftomed exertions to be made, or for new reformations to be begun. Suficient, and more than sufficient, for that day is the evil thereof. It will be too late to assume then the hero, or the faint, if we have been totally unacquainted with the character before.
The sentiments we would display, and the language we would utter, will be alien and firange to us. They will be forced, and soreign reign to the heart. It is only in confe- 


quence of habits acquired in former and better days, that a temper of piety and charity can grow up into such strength, as to confer peace and magnanimity on the concluding hours of life. Peculiarly favourable to the acquisition of such a temper, are the devotions of this day. In this view, let us perform them; and study to be at the table of the Lord, what we would with to be when the summons of death fhal come.
  Tin sacrament becomes a preparatnl. ,. leath, by laying a foundation for iJ,,ac with God. What is important at the close of life, is not only the temper in which we leave tie world, but the fituarion in which we stand with refpet to that great Judge, before whom we are about to appear. This view of our situation is apt to escape us, during the ordinary course of life. Occupied with the affairs and concerns of this world; flattered by those illufive colours of innocence and virtue, in which 8ERM. which felf-love dresses up our character,  apprehenfiQns of guilt create little unearlnefi to the multitude of men. But, on the approach of death, their ideas change. As the inquisition of the supreme Judge draws nigh, remembered transgressions crowd upon the mind. Guilt becomes strongly realifed to the imagination; and alarms, before unknown, begin to arise. Hence that anxiety, in the profpet of a future invifible world, which is so often seen to attend the bed of death. Hence those various methods, which fuperltition has devised for quieting this anxiety; the trembling mind eagerly grasping every feeble plank on which it can lay hold; and flying for protection to the most unavailing aid. The stoutest spirits have been then known to bend; the proudest hearts, to be humbled.
They who are now most thoughtless about their spiritual concerns, may, perhaps, be in this state before they die.

The dispensation of grace, discovered in the gospel, affords the only remedy against those terrors, by the promise of pardon, extended tended to the penitent, through the merits 

of our Lord Jesus Christ It is the very ,_ offence of this sacrament, to exhibit this promised grace to mankind; My body wbicb was broken for you; my blood Jbed for many, for the remijon of fins. Here, iines from above, the ray of hope. Divine juffice, we are assured, is not inexorable. Divine mercy is accessible, to all who believe and repent. The participation of this sacrament, therefore, naturally imparts comfort to the worthy communicant; as it supposes, on his part, a cordial compliance with those terms, on which pardon is offered by the gospel to mankind.

I mean not to fay, that the participation of this sacrament, how pious and proper soever our difpofitons at the time may be, is, of itself, sufficient to ensure us of comfort at death. It were unwarrantable to flatter Christians, with hopes to this extent.
No single act of the mos fervent devotion can afford assured hopes of peace with Heaven, until these hopes be confirmed by the succeeding tenor of a good life. But what may 8ERM. may safely be asserted is, that communica*. ting in a proper manner, makes way for such hopes. It is an introduction to that Rate of reconciliation with God, which will give you peace in death. It is the beginning of a good course, which, if duly pursued, will make your latter end blefied. It is the entrance of the path of the juJ ; the morning of that light, which fhinetb more and more unto the perfeft day. For this holy sacrament is a professed renunciation of the vices and corruptions of the world. It is a professed dereliction of former evil habits; a solemn return, on our part, to God and virtue, under the firm trust, that God will, through Jesus Christ, show mercy to the frailties of the penitent. If you continue to support the character which you this day assume, the invisible world will no longer present to you a scene of terrors.
You will be comforted with the view of goodness and compafion, as predominant in the administration of the universe. Aster having finiihed a virtuous course, you will be able to look up to that God whom you you have worshipped, and to fay, I know RM.
in wbom I have trufied. Though I walk xY through the valley of the Jhadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me. Tay rod and thy fJiffl all comfort me.

III. THis sacrament prepares us for a happy death, by strengthening the connection between Christians, and Christ their Saviour. This is a connection which, in various ways, redounds to their benefit; and will be found particularly consolatory at the hourfof death. The awful majesty of Heaven is in danger of overwhelming the mind, in the feeble moments of depart. life. The reverence it inspires is mingled with fenlitions of dread, which might be too strong for us then to bear. When we look up to it, through a Mediator and Intercessor, that Majesty assumes a milder aspet, and appears to invite our approach.
Whatever, therefore, forms a connection with this great Mediator, this powerful friend and patron of the human race, must be most desirable to every one, especially to the BERM. the dying man. Now, this sacrament uxv. _-. nites us closely with him. It is the oath of our allegiance. It is the act of enlisting ourselves under the banner. of this divine Leader. Of course, it ftrcngthens our faith in him, as our guide through life, and our guardian and protector in death. It gives us a title to look up to him, under the confidence of that reciprocal engagement, which fidelity on the one hand is always understood to imply, of protection on the other.

His participation of our nature conveys a degree of encouragement, which we could derive from no being altogether celeflial, how gracious or benign soever. In our utmost extremity, we can have recourse to his sympathizing aid, who had experience both of the distresses of life, and of the terrors of death. We behold, in the text, with what firm tranquillity he looked forward to his approaching sufferings. Sincere attachment to our great Master, may be expected to infuse into us some degree of the fame happy composure of mind. It is is owing to our losing out of view this perftt model; to our following the crowd, and adopting the common spirit of the world, that we become mean-fpirited and base; servilely attached to life, and afraid to die. Did we, according to our engagements at the Lord table, keep our eye fixed on our divine Leader, and itudy to follow his steps, a portion of his spirit would descend upon us at the hour of death. It would be as the mantle of Elijah, falling on a chosen disciple; and would enable us, as it did Eliiha of old, to finite, and divide the waters. We believe our Saviour now to rule in the world of fpirita The grave, therefore, bars not his followers from access to him. In the grave, for our fake, he once lay down, that he might dispel the gloom which appears to us to cover that formidable mansion. In a short time he arose from it, in order to assure us, that the dark and narrow house was not to confine his followers for ever. By his death, he conquered death; and him that had the power of it; and his voice to us is, Because I live, ye /ball live alo. Hence, -__ as long as we preserve that attachment to him which we this day profess, we are furnifted with a variety of canfiderations proper for supporting us in the profpec of our difolution.-This leads me to observe,   THAT the sacrament of which we are to partake, prepares us for death, by confirming and enlivening our hope of immortality. In this sacrament, my friends, you a& for both worlds. As inhabitants of the earth, you are on this day to look forward, with care, to your future behaviour in it. For you are not, by any means, disengaging yourselves totally from this life, and its concerns. On the contrary, you are forming, and even strengthening, those connecions, which virtue requires you to maintain with your friends, and fellowcreatures around yoL.--At the ifme time, you are not to confider yourselves as citizens of earth only; but also as citizens of heaven. You are to recogniLe, on this occafion, your relation to a higher and better country, 
country, with which you are connected by the most sacred ties; and from which you derive those comforts and hopes, that will both purify your life, and render your death happy. The sacrament of the supper is, in this view, an ascent of the mind above terrestrial things. At the Lord table, we associate ourselves, in rome degree, with spirits of a more exalted order. We declare, that we are tending towards their society; and have fixed our final reft within the veil. This view of the inflitution, so comfortable to the last period of life, is plainly given us in the words of the text.
For it is worthy of particular observation, that, as soon as our Lord had instituted this sacrament, he straightway leads the thoughts of his disciples to a state of future existence. Employing that metaphorical Rfyle, which the occasion naturally suggested, he tells them, that though he was not henceforth to drink of the fruit of the vine on earth, yet a day was coming, when he was again to' drink it with them; to drink it, in bis Father kiigdom. Two diftint  III. ideas ERM. ideas are, in these words, presented to us.  One is, the abode into which our Saviour was to remove; bis Father kingdom. The other, the iociety which he was there to enjoy; with you, in my Father kingdom. These correspond to the two views, under which death is most formidable to men; both of which he intended to banish, by the infitution of this sacrament: firll, that death is a transition to a new and unknown world; and next, that it is a final feparation from all the friends whom we have loved on earth.

FIRST; if death terminates our existence here, the abode to which it translates the faithful followers of Christ, is the kingdom of his Father. The inflitution of this facrament dispels all the gloomy ideas of annihilation, of non-exiftcnce, of total darkness, which our imagination is ready to asfociate with the grave. We are here affured, that, to good men, death is not the close of being, but a change of slate; a removal, from a distant and obscure province of of the universe, into the city of God, 
the chief feat of their Father kingdom. _ They have every reason to believe, that the objects which are to meet them there, how new and unknown soever, lhall all be propitious and friendly. For into the kingdom of his Father, their Lord has declared, that he is entered as their forerunner.
I go to my Father, and your Fabter; to my God, and your God. In my Father house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you. I will come again, and receive you to myself, that where I am, there ye may be alo.
What reasonings, what speculations, can have power to impart so much peace to the dying man, as a promise so direct and explicit, coming from him who is truth itself, and cannot lie ? If it were not Jo, I would have told you *. The profpet becomes still more chearing and relieving, when we include, 
THE other circumstance mentioned in John, xiv. 2.
  the  the text; the society to be enjoyed in that  future itate of being. With you, I Jball drink of the fruit of the vine in my Father kinr,  Inl how amiable a light does our Saviour here appear, looking forward to a future reunion with those beloved friends, whom he was now leaving, as to a circumstance which should increase both his own felicity and theirs, when they met again in a happier world ! Thus, in the molt assectionate manner, chearing their drooping and dejected ipirits; and, by a similar profpee, providing for the comfort of his followers in future generations, when they should be about to leave the world.

The exprelfions in the text plainly suggest a joyful intercourse among friends, who had been separated by death: and therefore seem to give much confirmation, to what has always been a favourite hope of good men; that friends stall know and recognife each other, and renew their former connecions, in a future state of existence.
How many pleating proiiects, does such an intimation open to tile mind! How much does does it tend to compensate the vanity of life, 


and to mitigate the sorrows of death ! For _ it is not to be denied, that one of the molt bitter circumstances attending death, is the final keparation from beloved friends. This is apt equally to wring the hearts of the dying, and the iurviving; and it is an anguilh of that fort, which dellcends most deeply into the virtuous and worthy breadt.
When, surrounded with an affcCtionate family, and weeping friends, a good man is taking his last adieu of all whom he held molt dear on earth; when, with a feeble voice, he is giving them his blessing, before he leaves them for ever; when, for the last time, he beholds the countenance, he touches the hand, he hears the voice, of the person nearefl his heart; who could bear this bitterness of grief, if no fiipport were to be minifecred by religious hope ? if there were no voice to whisper to our spirits, that hereafter we, and those whom we love, ihall meet again in a more blissful land?
--What higher view can possibly be given, of the benefit redounding from this 3 divine . divine intfitution, than its affording us conXV_ folation in fich situations of extreme distress, by realising to our fouls the belief of an immortal irate, in which all the virtuous and worthy ihall be reunited in the presence of their common Lord ?

Tllus I have set before you many confiderations, arising from the sacrament of our Lord flupper, which render it a proper preparation, not only for a good life, but for a comfortable and happy death.
The great improvement to be made of the subjea is, to bring to the altar of God such dispositions of heart, as may give us ground to hope for this blessed effect. Let us approach to the sacrament with the fame fcrioufnefs of frame, as if it were the last time we were ever to partake of it; as if we were now making provision for a journey to that land whence none return; as if we were never to drink, in this manner, of the fruit of the viln, urltil that day when we drink it, with thol whom we hIve loved, in our Father kiingtdom. -God only knows to whom whom this may be truly spoken! God knows who, of this assembly, ihall never  
have opportunity to approach again to the sacred table, and to meet with their brethren, on such an occasion, in the courts of the Lord house !-\VWhatever our doom is to be, whether we are appointed for life or for death, fich is the frame of mind which now best becomes, and will molt improve us, in partaking of the holy sacrament.

LET me caution you, before I conclude, 
against judging of the propriety of your disposition in this solemn of worihip, solely by the warmth of your affections, and the fervour of your devotion. This slate of heart, how desirable soever it may be, cannot be at all times poflcffed. It depends, in some measure, on natural fcnfibility. All are not equally endowed with warm and tender feelings. Even they who are susceptible of the highest degrees of pious and virtuous sensibility, cannot, on every occasion, command that happy temY 4 perature  perature of mind. We are not, therefore,  _ to judge unfavourably of ourfilves, if this be not always the privilege of our devotions. It is chiefly a sedate and compofed frame of spirit, that we mult tludy to cultivate; arising from grave and fober thoughts; from serious and penitent recolledtlon of past errors; from good purposes for the future; and from a deep fcnfe of the approaching events of death and immortality. Penetrated with filch difpofitions, you have ground to come to the altar of God with humble trust and joy; under the belief, that you are approaching, through the great Redeemer, to that merciful Creator, to whom, in the bigb and boly place of eternity, the devout aspirations of his servants on earth, are ever acceptable and pleating.


# SERMON XVI. On the USE and ABUSE of the WORLD. 1 CORINTHIANS,  31.  They that use this world, as not abusing it. 


On the UsE and ABUSE of the WORLD.

I CORINTHIANS,  31.

-They that its this wgrld, as ntr abotfing it.THE world is always represented in 
Scripture as the great scene of trial to a Christian. It sets before him a variety of duties, which are incumbent on him to perform; and, at the fame time, surrounds him with many dangers, against which he has to guard. The part which is proper for him to aCt, may be comprised in these two expressive words of the text; uJing the world, and not albnTig it; the significancy and extent of which, I purpose now to explain. The subjed is of the higher imSBR  portance, as in the world we must live; 
and according as we uie, or abuse it, it will prove either our fi'icnd, or our greatclt foe.

It is natural to begin with observing, 
that the Chrillian is here supposed to ife the world; by which we must certainly underftand the Apoitle to mean, maintaining intercourfi .ld connection with the world; living in it, as one of the members of human ocicty; assuming that rank which belongs to his station. No one can be said to ufc' the world who lives not thus. Hence it follows, that sequestration from the world is no part of Chriltian duty; and it appears ftrangc, that even among those who approve not of monaftick confinement, feclufion from the pleafurcs of society should have been sometimes confidered, as bclonging to the character of a religious man.
They have been supposed to be the best fcrvants of God, who, consecrating their time to the exercifcs of (dvotion, mingle least in the ordinary commerce of the world; and cfpccially who abstain most rigidly rigidly from all that has the appearance of 
amusement. But how pious and sincere  soever the intentions of such persons may be, they certainly take not the propereft method, either for improving themselves, or for advancing religion among others. For this is not using the world, but relinquilhing it. Instead of making the light of a good example shine with useful splendour throughout the circle of society, they confine it within a narrow compass. According to the metaphor employed by our Saviour, after the candle is lighted, they put it under a bujhel. Instead of recommending religion to the world, they exhibit it under the forbidding aspect of unnecessary aufterity. Instead of employing their influence, to regulate and temper the pleasures of the world, by a moderate participation of those that are innocent, they deliver up all the entertainments of society, into the hands of the loose and giddy.

The various dangers which the world presents to one who is desirous of maintaining his piety and integrity, have given rife  rife to this scrupulous caution concerning xvI. the use of the world; and so far, the principle is commendable. But we must remember, that the virtue of a Christian is to be shown, in surmounting dangers which he is called to encounter. Into the post of danger we were ordered by Providence, when we were brought into this world.
We were placed as soldiers, on the field of battle. It is there, that our fidelity to our great Commander must appear. The most signal virtues which adorn and improve the human character, are displayed in a&ive life. There, the strength of the mind is brought forth, and put to the test. There, all the amiable dispositions of the heart find their proper exercise: humanity is cultivated; patience, fortitude, and felf-denial, come forward in all their forms; and the light of good men works so shines before others, as to lead them to glorify their Father wvhicb is in heaven.

It may be assumed, therefore, as a principle justified by the text, and by the whole strain of Scripture, that to use, and in a certain tain degree to enjoy, the world, is altoge- 
ther confifent with religion. According  to the rank which men possess in society, according to their age, their employment and connections, their intercourse with the world will be more or less extended. In private life, they use the world with propriety, who are ative and industrious in their callings; just and upright in their dealings; fober, contented, and chearful in their station. When the circumstances of men allow them a wider command of the enjoyments of the world, of those enjoyments they may freely partake, within the bounds of temperance, moderation, and decency. The highest situations of rank and opulence, ought to be distinguished by dignity of charader; by extensive beneficence, usefulness, and public spirit; by magnificence, without ostentation; and generous hospitality, without profuiion.

We shall have a clearer view of the proper use of the world, when we contrast it with that abuse of the world, which we too often oblerve. Those abuses manifest themselves in various forms; but in general may be classed under three great heads.

I. They are abusers of the world, who intemperately give themselves up to its pleafures, and lead a life of licentioufnefi, riot, and dissipation. Amidlt the wealth and luxury of the present age, it will be admitted, that persons of this description are not unfrequent, who, being opulent in fortune, and perhaps high in rank, think themselves intitled to pass their days in a careless manner, without any other objec in view, than the gratification of their senses and paflions. It shall be granted, that they are not obliged to that exat oeconomy and attention in their manner of living, which the state of fortune may require of others.
Gaiety shall be permitted to them; change of scene, and variety of amusements. But let them not forget, that as men and members of society, not to fay professors of the Christian faith, they are bound to flop (hort in their career of pleasure, as soon as it becomes disgraceful to themselves, and hurtful ful to the world. By the train of life which they lead, they defeat every purpose for which Providence beflowed on them the blessings of prolperitv. They fink every talent which they poilefs, into useless infignificancy. They corrupt the public manners by their example; and diiiule among others the spirit of extravagance and folly.
They behave in a manner altogether unsuitable to the condition of the world in which we live; where we are exposed to so much change, firrounded with so much distress, and daily behold ib many asseting scenes, as ought to awaken serious rellection, and chailen dirfolute mirth.

With indignant eves, the fober and tllinking part of mankind, view the luxury anl riot of those abulkrs of the world. To them are owing the discontents of the poor, their difaffecion to their fupcriors, their proneness to disturb the peace of the world.
When the poor behold wealth properly used, they look up with refped to them who poflefs it. They reft contented in their llation; and bless the just and the ge nerous, from whose munificence they reXV. ceive employment and reward. But when they behold those men of pleasure diffipating, in vice and folly, the fortune which their forefathers had honourably earned; when they behold them opprefling all their dependents, merely that they may revel in luxurious extravagance, then their hearts swell within them; with murmurs of fullen grief, they eye their Own mean habitation, and needy family; and become prepared for robbery, tumult, sedition, and every evil work.

The conduct of such abusers of the world, is not only pernicious to the welfare of society, and to the interests of virtue; it is equally ruinous to themselves.
I ihall not insist on the loss of reputation, the waste of fortune, the broken health, and debilitated frame, which are the wellknown consequences of a life of intemperate pleasure. I shall not recount all the better and more substantial enjoyments which they forfeit. Amidit the turbulence of riot, and the fumes of intoxication, unknown known to them are the rational entertain- 

XVL ments of regular life; the enjoyment of the _ face of nature; the pieafures of knowledge, and an improved mind; the pleafilres of private friendlhip, and domestic society; the conlcious litisfadion which accompanies honourable labours, and the jully acquired efleem of those who surround diem.
All theie they have thrown away; and in their room have substituted, what they think more high and vivid pleasures. But of what nature are those pleasures ? Even in liaghter the heart is frrowuyl; and the end of that mirth is heavinei +.

At the bottom of the hearts of all men, 
there lies a secret sense of propriety, virtue, and honour. This sense may be ob far blunted, as to lose its influence in guiding men to what is right, while yet it retains its power of making them feel that they are. acting wrong. Hence remorse often gnaws the heart, which affeas to appear light, and gay, before the world. Among the crowd of aVol. III. mufements,   mufements, the voluptuary may endea_  deavour to ltifle his uncafinels; but through all his defences it will penetrate. A confcious lense of his own insignificance, when he fees others diftinguilhed for atilng a manly and worthy part; reflection on the time he has wafted, and the contempt he has incurred; the galling remembrance of his earlier and better days, when he gave the fair promise of accomplilhmcnts, which now are blasted, have frequently been found to fadden the fcftive hour. The noie' of merriment may be heard; but hcavincfs lies at the heart. While the tabret and the viol play, a melancholy voice founds in his ears. The wafted estate, the neglected halls, and ruined mansion of his fathers, rife to view. The angry countenances of his friends, seem to flare him in the fice. A hand appears to come forth on the wall, and to write his doom.

Retreat then, from your dishonourable courses, ye who by licentioufnefl, extravagance, and vice, are abusers of the world!
you are degrading, you are ruining yourselves. You are grossly miremploving the gifts of God; and the giver will not fail to XVI punilh. Awake to the pursuits of men of virtue, and honour. Break loose from that magic circle, within which you are at present held. Reje& the poisoned cup which the enchantress Pleasure holds up to your lips. Draw aside the veil which ihe throws over your eyes. You will then fee other objets than you now behold. You will fee a dark abyss opening below your feet.
You will fee virtue and temperance marking out the road, which conducts to true felicity. You will be enabled to discern, that the world is enjoyed to advantage, by none but such as follow those divine guides; and who confider pleasure as the seasoning, but not as the business of life.
  THE world is abused, not only by an intemperate pursuit of its pleasures, but by a fordid attachment to its gains. This respeds a set of men of very different description from the former; more decent in their carriage, and less flagrant in their . 2 vices; 
BERM. vices; but corrupted by the world in no xvL less a degree. For the world is often abused by the men of butinefs, as much as by the men of pleasure. When worldly success becomes the sole object of their life; when the accumulation of fortune so engrolfes them, as to harden their heart against every feeling of moral obligation; when it renders them insensible to the calls of asfecion, and to the impressions ox piety and religion; they then come under the class of the covetous, whom, it is said, the Lord abborretb *.

The world, with its advantages, is a lawful object of pursuit to a Christian.
He may seek, by fair industry, to render his circumitances affluent. Without reproof, he may aim at distinction and consideration in the world. He may beRtow a considerable portion of his time and attention, on the successful management of his worldly interests. All this is within the limits of that allowable use of the world, to which religion gives its sanction. But to Psalm  3.

a a wife and good man, the world is only a .


secondary object. He remembers there is  an eternity beyond it. His care is, not merely to amass and possess, but to use his poffeiffons well, as one who is accountable to God. He is not a save, either to the hopes, or the fears of the world. He would rather forfeit any present advantage, than obtain it at the expencc of violating the divine  or neglecting his duty. This is using the world like a good man. This is living in it, as a subjed of God, and a member of the great community of mankind. To such a man, riches are a blefsing. He may enjoy them with magnificence; but he will use them with liberality. They open a wide field to the exercif:
of his virtuc, and allow it to shine with diffilfive lufire.

Very opposite to this, is the character of the worldly-minded. To them, the mere attainment of earthly poffefions, is an ultimate aim. They cannot be said to tfe the world; for to posess,, not to use or enjoy, is their object. They are emphatically said 3 in  il Scripture, to /lad enflvc wilb thick   `'. Some fort of apology imav hb framed for them who seek to extract from the world, pleafurc of one kind or other. But for thole who know no ple:afurc, farther than adding boise to bore, and field to field, and calling them their own, it is hardly possible to frame any apology. Such persons are idolaters of the worst kind; for they have made the world their God.

Under this class are included, the worst and most criminal abufcrs of the world; who turn a^ainft their fellow - crcatures, those advantages with which it has pleased Heaven to diflinguilh them. It is a class which comprehends, the sovereign who tyrannises over his people; the great man who oppreffcs his dependents; the master who is cruel to his servants; every one, in fine, who renders his superiority of any kind, whether of wealth or power, unnecessarily grievous to those who are his inferiors: Whose supercilioufnefs dejeas the modest; whose infolence tramples on the poor; whose rigour makes the widow and the orphan weep.

But let them not think, their'triumph is always to latl Their turn Ihall come, to be humbled as low as those whom they now opprcfs.

Within these limits, we may safely enjoy all the comforts which the world affords, and our station allows. But if we pass beyond these boundaries, into the regions of disorderly and vicious pleasure, of debasing covetousness, or of oppressive insolence, the world will then serve only to corrupt our minds, and to accelerate our ruin. The licentious, the avaricious, and the insolent, form the three great classes of abusers of the world.

Let not thote who are in wealthy and flourifling circumstances, complain of the restraints which religious doctrine attempts to impose on their enjoyments. For, to what do there refiraints amount ? To no more than this, that, by their pleasures, they would neither injure themselves, nor injure others. We call not on the young, to relinquifli their gaiety; nor on the rich, 
to to forego their opulence; nor on the great, to lay alide their slate. We only call on them, not to convert gaiety into licentiousness; not to employ opulence in mere extravagance; nor to abuse greatness for the oppression of their inferiors: While they enjoy the world, not to forget that they are the fubjeds of God, and are loon to pass into another state. Let the motive by which the Apostle enforces the exhortation in the text, present itself to their thought; Lie this world as not abusing it; for the faJhion of the world paetbh away. Its pomp and its pleasures, its riches, magnificence, and glory, are no more than a transient show. Every thing that we here enjoy, changes, decays, and comes to an end. All floats on the surface of a river, which, with swift current, is running towards a boundless ocean. Beyond this present scene of things, above these sublunary regions, we are to look for what is permanent and stable. The world pafles away; but God, and heaven, and virtue, continue unchangeably the fame. We ate soon to enter into eternal  eternal habitations: and into these, oui _Vl works {hall follow us.

On EXTREMES in RELIGIOUS and MORAL CONDUCT.

PROVERBS,  27.
Turn not to the right band, nor to the left. Will behave mfff wisej , said the Pfallnit 
David, in a perfrc way . Wildom is 

no less necessary in religious, and moral, than in civil conduct. Unless there be a proper degree of light in the understanding, it will not be enough, that there are good dispositions in the heart. Without regular guidance, they will often err fiom the right scope. They will be always wavering  vering and unfleady; nay, on some occaxvnl sions, they may betray us into evil. This is too much verified by that propensity to run into extremes, which so often appears in the behaviour of men. How many have originally set out with good principles, and intentions, who, through want of difcretion in the application of their principles, have in the end injured themselves, and brought discredit on religion ? There is a certain temperate mean, in the observance of which, piety and virtue consist. On each there lies a dangerous extreme.
Bewildering paths open; by deviating into which, men are apt to forfeit all the praise of their good intentions; and to finifl with reproach, what they had begun with honour. This is the ground of the wife man exhortation in the text. Iet thine eyes look right on, and let thine eye-lids look flraight before thee. .Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be eftablified. Turn not to the right hand, nor to the left; remove tbyfootfrom evil. In discoursing from these words, I purpose to point out some of the extremes extremes into which men are apt to run in religion and morals; and to suggest dircc- _XVI tions for guarding against them.

WITH regard to religious principle in general, it may perhaps be expeced, that I should warn you of the danger of being, on one hand, too rigid in adhering to it, and, on the other hand, too easy in relaxing it. But the diftindion between these supposed extremes, I conceive to have no foundation. No man can be too ftrid, in his adherence to a principle of duty. Here, there is no extreme. All relaxation of principle, is criminal. What conscience ditates is to be ever obeyed. Its commands are universally sacred. Even though it should be misled, yet, as long as we conceive it to utter the voice of God, in disobeying it we fin. The error, therefore, to be here avoided is, not too scrupulous or tender regard to conscience, but too little care to have conscience properly enlightened, with refpet to what is matter of duty and of fin. - Recive not, without examination,   III. A a whatever  whatever human tradition has consecrated XVII.

, as sacred. Recur, on every occasion, to those great fountains of light and knowledge, which are opened to you in the pure word of God. Diftinguiih, with care, between the superstitious fancies of men, and the everlasting commandments of God.
Exhaust not on trifles that zeal, which ought to be reserved for the weightier matters of the law. Overload not confcicnce, with what is frivolous and unnecessary.
But when you have once drawn the line, with intelligence and precision, between dnty and fin, that line you ought on no occasion to transgress.

THOUGH there is no extreme in the reverence due to conscience, there may undoubtedly be an extreme, in laying too much stress, either on mere principle, or on mere practice. Here we must take particular care, not to turn to the right band, nor to the left; but to bold faith and a good csfrience united, as the Scripture, with great propriety, 
propriety, exhorts ns *. The error of reft- FR 


 wholly on faith, or wholly on works,  i is one of those fedudions, which most eafily mislead men; under the semblance of piety on the one hand, and of virtue on the other. This is not an error peculiar to our times. It has obtained in every age of the Christian church. It has run through all the different modes of false religion. It forms the chief diftinftion of all the various fedts which have divided, and which ltill continue to divide the church; according as they have leaned most to the of belief, or to the of morality.

Did we liften candidly to the voice of Scripture,it would guard us against either extreme.
The Apostle Paul every where testifies, that by no works of our own we can be juftifled; and that vitxhut faith it is impofible to please God. The Apostle James as clearly shows, that faith, if it be unproductive of good works, justifies no man. Between thole sentiments, there is no opposition.

' Tirothy, i. 19.

A a 2 Faith  Faith without works, is nugatory and inxvH_, significant. It is a foundation, without any fuperftrucdre raised upon it. It is a fountain which fends forth no stream; a tree which neither bears fruit, nor affords (hade.
Good works, again, without good principles, are a fair, but airy ftrudure; without firmness or stability. They resemble the house built on the sand; the reed which shakes with every wind. You must join the two in full union, if you would exhibit the character of a real Christian. He who sets faith in opposition to morals, or morals in opposition to faith, is equally an enemy to the interests of religion. He holds up to view an imperfect and disfigured form; in the room of what ought to command refpet from all beholders. By leaning to one extreme, he is in danger of falling into vice; by the other, of running into impiety.

WHATEVER the belief of men be, they generally pride themselves, in the possession of obme good moral qualities. The sense of of duty is deeply rooted in the human 


heart. Without some pretence to virtue, _ there is no felf-efleem; and no man wishes to appear in his own view, as entirely worthless. But as there is a constant strife between the lower and higher parts of our nature, between inclination and principle, this produces much contradition and inconsistency in conduc. Hence arise most of the extremes, into which men run in their moral behaviour; refting their whole worth on that good quality, to which, by constitution or temper, they are most inclined.

ONE of the firfi and most common of those extremes, is that of placing all virtue, either in justice, on the one hand; or in generosity, on the other. The opposition between these, is most discernible among two different classes of men in focicty.
They who have earned their fortune by a laborious and industrious life, are naturally tenacious of what they have painfully acquired. To justice, they confider themA a selves  eflves as obliged; but to go beyond it ia  , aCcas of kindness, they confider as superfluous and extravagant. They will not take any advantage of others, which conscience tells them is iniquitous; but neither will they make any allowance for their neccffities and wants. They contend, with rigorous exadnefs, for what is due to themselves. They are satisfied, if no man susser unjustly by them. That no one is benefited by them, gives them little concern.
- Another set of men place their whole merit in generosity and mercy; while to justice and integrity they pay small regard.
These are persons generally of higher rank, and of easy fortune. To them, juffice appears a fort of vulgar virtue, requisite chiefly in the petty tranfadtions, which those of inferior fation carry on with one another.
But humanity and liberality, they confider as more refined virtues, which dignify their characer, and cover all their failings. They can relent at reprcfentations of distress; can bellow with ostentatious generosity; can even occaionally {hare their wealth with a companion companion of whom they are fond; while, SERK at the fame time, they with-hold from XVII others what is due to them; are negligent of their family and their relations; and to the just demands of their creditors give no attention.

Both these classes of men run to a faulty extreme. They aivide moral virtue between them. Each takes that part of it only, which suits his temper. Without juffice, there is no virtue. But without humanity and mercy, no virtuous charaCter is complete. The one man leans to the extreme of parsimony. The other, to that of profusion. The temper of the one is unfeeling. The sensibility of the other is thoughtless. The one you may in some degree refpea; but you cannot love. The other may be loved; but cannot be refpeated: and it is difficult to   which characer is most defetive.-We must undoubtedly begin with being jurt, before we attempt to be generous. At the fame time, he who goes no farther than bare justice, flops at the beginning of virtue. We are A a 4 ; omn  commanded to do jutly; but, to love mercy.

-~, The one virtue, regulates our actions. The other, improves our heart and affecions.
Each is equally necessary to the happiness of the world. Justice is the pillar, that upholds the whole fabric of human focietv.
Mercy is the genial ray, which chears and warms the habitations of men. The perfedion of our social characterconfifts, in properly tempering the two with one another; in holding that middle course, which admits of our being just, without being rigid; and allows us to be generous, without being unjust.

WE muff next guard against either too great severity, or too great facility of manners. These are extremes, of which we every day behold instances in the world.
He who leans to the of severity, is harfl in his censures, and narrow in his opinions. He cannot condescend to others in things indifferent. He has no allowance to make for human frailty; or for the difference of age, rank, or temper, among mankind.

mankind. With him, all gaiety is sinful 


levity; and every amusement is a crime. '-;vTo this extreme, the admonition of Solomon may be understood to belong; Be not righteous over much; neither make tbyelf over wis. Why /houldft thou dtflroy thyself *
When this severity of manners is hypocritical, and assumed as a cloak to secret indulgence, it is one of the worst proftitutions of religion. But I now confider it, not as the effec of design, but of natural austerity of temper, and of contrated maxims of conduct. Its influence upon the person himself, is to render him gloomy and four; upon others, to alienate them both from his society, and his counsels; upon religion, to set it forth as a morose and forbidding principle.-The opposite extreme to'this is, perhaps, still more dangerous; that of too great facility, and accommodation to the ways of others. The man of this character, partly from indolent weakness, and partly from softness of tem*Ecccf.  16.


r8El per, is disposed to a tame and universal as. I, sent. Averse either to contradic or to blance, he goes along with the manners that prevail. He views every character with indulgent eye; and with good dispositions in his breat, and a natural relutance to profligacy and vice, he is enticed to the conmillion of evils which he condemns, merely through want of fortitude to oppose others.

Nothing, it must be confessed. in moral conduct, is more difficult, than to avoid turning here, either to the right band or to the left. One of the grtateft trials both of wisdom and virtue is, to preserve a just medium, between that harshness of aufterity, which disgusts and alienates mankind, and that weakness of good-nature, which opens the door to sinful excefi. The one separates us too much from the world. The other connects us too cloely with it; and reduces us to follow the multitude in doing evil. One who is of the former character, studies too little to be agreeable, in order to render himself useful. He who is of the latter, 
latter, by studying too much to be agree- stitU able, forfeits his innocence. If the one a_ hurt religion, by cloathing it in the garb of unnecessary ftridnefs; the other, by unwarrantable compliance, strengthens the power of corruption in the world. The one borders on the character of the Phirifee; the other, on that of the Sadducee.
True religion enjoins us to stand at an equal distance from both; and to pursue the difficult, but honourable aim, of uniting good nature with fixed religious principle; affable manners, with untainted virtue.

FARTHER ; we run to one extreme, when we contemn altogether the opinions of man.
kind; to another, when we court their praise too eagerly. The former discovers a high degree of pride and felf-conceit.
The latter betrays servility of spirit. We are formed by nature and Providence, to be connected with one another. No man can stand entirely alone, and independent of all his fellow-creaturcs. A reasonable re.


gE  gard, therefore, for their esteem and good -,, opinion, is a commendable principle. It flows from humanity; and coincides with the desire of being mutually useful. But, if that regard be carried too tar, it becomes the-fource of much corruption. For in the present slate of mankind, the praise of the world often interferes with our acting that steady and conscientious part, which gains the approbation of God. Hence arises the difficulty of drawing a proper line, between the allowable regard for reputation, and the exceflive dcfire of praise. On the one  and on the other, dangers meet us; and either extreme will be pernicious to virtue.
 who extinguishes all regard to the frntiments of mankind, suppresses one incentive to honourable deeds; nay, he removes one of the lIrongefi checks on vice.
For, where there is no desire of praifc, there will be also no sense of reproach and si ame; and when this sense is destroyed, the way is paved to open profligacy. On the other hand, he who is acuated solely by the love of human praise, incroaches on the the higher refpe& which he owes to SERX XVIL science, and to God. Hence, virtue ist often counterfeited; and many a fplendid appearance has been exhibited to the world, which had no basis in real prin.
ciple, or inward affection. Hence, religious truths have been disguised, or unfairly represented, in order to be suited to popular taste. Hence the Scribes and Pharilees rejeted our blessed Lord, becanfi they loved the prafi of men more than the praise of God.-Turn, therefore, neither to the right hand, nor to the left. Assed not to despise what the world thinks of your condud and characer; and yet, let not the sentiments of the world entirely rule you.
Let a desire of esteem be one motive of your condut; but let it hold a fubordinate place. Measure the regard that is due to the opinions of men, by the degree in which these coincide with the law of God.

ALLOW me next to suggest, the danger of running to the extreme of anxiety about worldly interests on the one hand, and of negligence SERAM. negligence on the other. It is hard to sty _,_, which of these extremes is fraught with mot vice, and most misery. Industry and diligence are unquestionable duties, ftrici ly enforced on all Chriltians; and he who fails in making suitable provision for his household and family, is pronounced to be rorfe than an infidel. But there are bounds, within which our concern for worldly fuccess mufl be confined. For anxiety is the certain poison of human life. It debases the mind; and iharpens all the paflions.
It involves men in perpetual diftraCfions, and tormenting cares; and leads them aside from what ought to be the great scope of human afion. Anxiety is, in general, the effeA of a covetous temper. Negligence is commonly, the offspring of licentiousness, and always, the parent of universal difor.
der. By anxiety, you render yourselves miserable. By negligence, you too often occasion the ruin of others. The anxious man is the votary of riches; the negligent man, the votary of pleasure. Each offers his mistaken worihip, at the llrine of a false false deity; and each ihall reap only such rewards as an idol can bellow; the one fa.
crificing the enjoyment and improvement of the present, to vain cares about futurity; the other so totally taken up in enjoying the present, as to ore the future with certain miseries. -True virtue holds a temperate course between these extremes; neither careless of to-morrow, nor taking too much thought for it; diligent, but not anxious; prudent, but not covetous; attentive to provide comfortable accommodation on earth, but chiefly concerned to lay up treafitrec in Heaven.

I {hall only warn you farther against the extreme, of engaging in a courle ot hte too busy and hurned, or of devoting yourselves to one too retired and unemployed.
We are formed for a mixture ot acton, and retreat. Our connections with society, and the performance of the duties which we owe to one another, necessarily engage us in active life. What we owe to ourselves, requires occasional retirement For he wlho lives GERM. lives always in the buffle of the world canxvsl. not, it is to be feared, always prcferve his virtue pure. Sentiments of piety will be deprived of that nourilhment and support, which they would derive from meditation and devotion. His temper will be often ruffled and disturbed. His passions will be kept too much on the stretch. From the contagious manners which every where abound, he will not be able to avoid contracqing some dangerous infection.- On the other hand, he who flies to total retreat, in order either to enjoy ease, or to escape from the temptations of the world, will often find disquiet meeting him in solitude, and the worst temptations arising from within himself. Unoccupied by acive and honourable pursuits, unable to devote his whole time to improving thoughts, many an evil pafilon will start up, and occupy the vacant hour. Sullenness and gloom will be in danger of overwhelming him. Peevish displeasure, and suspicions of mankind, are apt to persecute those who withdraw themselves altogether from the haunts of men.

-Steer Steer therefore a middle course, SEB .

tween a life oppressed with bufnefs on the one hand; and burdened, for the burden is no less, with idleness on the other. Provide for yourselves matter of fair and honest pursuit, to afford a proper obje& to the aAtive powers of the mind. Temper business with serious meditation; and enliven retreat by returns of action and induftry.

THUS I have pointed out some of those extremes into which men are apt to run, by forsaking the line which religion and wisdom have drawn. Many more, I am sensible, might be suggested; for the field is wide, and hardly is there any appearance of piety, virtue, or good conduct, but what the folly of men is apt to push into undue excels, on one or other  What I have mentioned, will be sufficient to ihow the necessity of prudent circumfpeieon, in order to escape the dangers which beset us in this state of trial.

Thus, turning neither to the right band nor to the left, we Ihall, as far as our frailty permits, approach to the perfecion of the human character; and ihall have reason not to be ajbamed when we have equal refpcct to all God commandments.


# SERMON XVIII. On SCOFFING at RELIGION. 2 Peter, iii. 3.  There shall come in the last days Scoffers. 




On SCOPPING at RELIGION.

2 Peter, iii. 3.

 herejball come i the lajI days Soffcrs.-A the Christian religion is adverse to the 

inchnauons and paihons ot the corrupt- xvIII.
 part ot manund, it has been its tate, every age, to encounter the oppolition of various foes. Sometimes, it has undergone the storms of violence and persecution. Sometimes, it has been attacked by the arms of false reasoning, and sophistry. When these have failed of success, it has at other times been exposed to the scoffs of the petulant. Men of light and frivolous minds, who had no comprehtainio of thought for discerning , b 2 'hat EZ . what is great, and no solidity of judgeXVIII. ment for deciding on what is true, have taken upon them to treat religion with contempt, as if it were of no consequence to the world. They have asseted to represent the whole of that venerable fabric, which has so long commanded the refpet of mankind; which, for ages, the learned have supported, and the wife have admired, as having no better foundation than the gloomy imagination of fanatics and vifionaries. Of this charaer were those fcofsers, predicted by the Apostle to arise ix the lta days a predicion which we have seen too often fulfilled As the falie colours which such men throw on religion, are apt to impose on the wek and unwary, let us now examine, whether religion affords any jift grounds for the contempt or ridicule of the scoffer. They must be either the dotrines, or the precepts of religion, which he endeavours to hold forth to contempt.

Tab doctrines of the Chriflian religion are ratiorn pure. All tht it has revealed wealed concerning the perfetlions of God, s3 It his moral government and laws, the deftination of man, and the rewards and punithments of a future state, is perfettly con, sonant to the most enlightened reason. In some articles which transcend the limits of our present faculties, as in what relates to the eflence of the Godhead, the fallen state of mankind, and their redemption by Jesus Christ, its do&trines may appear mysterious and dark. Against these, the scoffer has often directed his attacks; as if whatever could not be explained by us, ought upon that account to be exploded as absurd.

It is unnecessary to enter,at prefent,on any particular defence of these ditrines, as there is one observation which, if duly weighed, is fuffident to silence the cavils of the rcofser. Is he not compelled to admit, that the whole system of nature around him is full of myfery? What reason, then, had he to suppose, that the do&rines of revelation, proceeding from the fame author, were to contain no myfterios obscurity ? All that is requifie for the condu& of life, both b 3 nature . nature and in religion, divine wisdom has _XVI_. rendered obvious to all. As nature has asforded us fuilicient information concerning what is necetfary for our tood, our accommodation, and our safety; so religion has plainly inltructcd us in our duty towards God, and our neighbour. But as lion as we attempt to rile towards objects that lie beyond our immediate sphere of aCtion, our curiolity is checked; and darkness meets us on every  What the essence is of those material bodies which we fee and handle; how a feed grows up into a tree; how man is formed in the womb; or how the mind ads upon the body, after it is formed; are mysteries of which we can give no more account, than of the most obscure and difficult parts of revelation. We are obliged to admit the existence of the fad, though the explanation of it exceeds our faculties.

After the fame manner, in natural religion, questions arise concerning the creation of the world from nothing, the origin of evil under the government of a per,  Being, 
Being, and the consistency of human liber- 
ty with divine prescience, which are of as xi intricate nature, and of as difficult solution, as any queftlons in Christian theology. We may plainly fee, that we are not admitted into the secrets of Providence, any more than into the mysteries of the Godhead. In all his ways, the Almighty is a God that bidetb himsef He makctb darkness hit pavilion. He boldeth back thee face of bi throne; and fpreadeth a thick cloud upon it.-InRead of its being any objection to revelation, that some of its dotrines are myfterious, it would be much more ifrange and unaccountable, if no such dodrines were found in it. Had every thing in the Chriftian system been perfectly level to our capacities, this might rather have given ground to a suspicion, of its not proceeding from God; since it would have been then so unlike to what we find, both in the system of the universe, and in the system of natural religion. Whereas, according as matters now stand, the gospel has the fame seatures, the fame general characer, with the b 4 other SERtB. other two, which are acknowledged to be of ~^ divine origin; plain and comprchenfible, in what relates to pracice; dark and myfterious, in what relates to speculation and belief *. The cavils of the scoffer, therefore, on this head, are so far from having any jus foundation, that they only discover his ignorance, and the narrowness of his views.

LET us next proceed to what relates to prafice, or the preceptive part of religion.
-The duties which religion enjoins us to perform towards God, are those which have ofteneft furnished matter to the fcoft of the licentious. They attempt to represent thef: as so idle and superfluous, that they could owe their birth to nothing but en.
thufidia.-For, is not the Deity so far exalhd above us, as to receive neither advantage nor pleasure, from our worship ? What are our prayers,or our praifes,to that infinite Sec this argument fully pursued, and placed in a sfg light, by tim mdekry hand of BiRop Butler, in hi; dots/ A A 4RAw4a R4 0iw.


mind, who, refting in the full enjoyment SErtM of his own beatitude, beholds all his crea- xvIt.
tures palling before him, only as the infects of a day ? What but superstitious terrors, could have dictated those forms of homage, and those diftintions of sacred days, in which vulgar minds delight, but which the liberal and enlarged look upon with scorn?

Now, in return to such insults of the scoffer, it might be sufficient to observe, that the united sentiments of mankind, in every age and nation, are against him.
Thoughtless as the bulk of men are, and attached only to objects which they fee around them; this principle has never been extinguished in their breasts, that to the great Parent of the human race, the universal, though invisible, benefactor of the world, not only internal reverence, but external homage is due. Whether he need that homage or not, is not the queRfion. It is what, on our part, we undoubtedly owe; and the heart is, with reason, held to be bate, which tfifles the emotions of gratitude to a benefaaor, how independent soever SE tR ever he may be of any returns. True virXVIII. XVI__ tue, always prompts a public declaration of the grateful sentiments which it feels; and glories in exprefling them. Accordingly, over all the earth, crowds of worshippers have aflembled to adore, in various forins, the Ruler of the world. In these adorations, the philosopher, the savage, and the faints have equally joined. None but the cold and unfeeling can look up to that beneficent Being, who is at the head of the universe, without some inclination to pray, or to praise. In vain, therefore, would the scoffer deride, what the loud voice of nature demands andjuftifies. He ere himself againit the general, and declared sense of the human race.

But apart from this consideration, I must call on him to attend to one of a still more serious and awful nature. By his licentious ridicule of the duties of piety, and of the institutions of divine worship, he is weakening the power of conscience over men; he is undermining the great pillars of socicty; he is giving a mortal blow to public order, 
order, and public happineis. All there reft on nothing so much, as on the general xvL.
lief of an all-feeing witness, and the general veneration of an Almighty Governor, On this belief, and this veneration, is found. the whole obligation of an oath; without which, government could not be adminiftered, nor courts of justice at; contro.
verfies could not be determined, nor private property be preserved safe. Our only fecurity againit innumerable crimes, to which the refiraints of human laws cannot reach, is the dread of an invisible avenger, and of those future punishments which he hath prepared for the guilty. Remove this dread from the minds of men; and you firengthen the hands of the wicked, and endanger the safety of human society.

But how could impressions so neceflary to the public welfare be preierved, if there were no religious assemblies, no sacred inftitutions, no days set apart for divine worihip, in order to be solemn remembrancers to men of the existence, and the dominion of God; and of the future account they have to Ste to give of their actions to him ? To all rtnke xvxIL of men, the fentimente which public religion tends to awaken, are salutary and beneficial. But with refpet to the inferior classes, it ie well known, that the only principles which restrain them from evil, are acquired in the religious assemblies which they frequent. Destitute of the advantages of regular education; ignorant, in great measure, of public laws; unacquainted with those refined ideas of honour and propriety, to which other of more knowledge have been trained; were those sacred temples deserted to which they now resort, they would be in danger of degenerating into a ferocious race, from whom lawlefi violence was perpetually to be dreaded.

He, therefore, who treats sacred things with any degree of levity and scorn, is ading the part, perhaps without his feeing or Inowing it, of a public enemy to society.
He is preeifely the madma described in the book of Proverbs, * who caqthb frramnr, 
* Pror. uri. if&


arrow:, and death; and faith, am I not in SElIt fpert? We ihall hear him, at times, vl_ plain loudly of the undutifulness of children, of the dishonesty of servants, of the tumults and insolence of the lower ranks; while he himself is, in a great measure, rtfponfible for the disorders of which he complains. By the example which he sets of contempt for religion, he becomes accefiry to the manifold crimes, which tat contempt occasions among others. By his feoffing at sacred institutions, he is encouraging the rabble to uproar and violence; he is emboldening the false witness to take the name of God in vain; he is, in cffet, putting arms into the hands of the highwayman, and letting loose the robber on the streets by night.

WE came next to confider that great class of duties, which refpet our conduA towards our fellow-creaturs. The obfolute nece~iy of thefc to general welfare is so apparent, as to have secured them, in a reat degree, from the attacks of the fcofSItM. ser. He who mhould attempt to turn jumi fice, truth, or honesty, into ridicule, would be avoided by every one. To those who had any remains of principle, he would be odious. To thoie who attended only to their interest, he would appear a dangerous man. But though the fbcial virtues are treated in general as refpedable and lared, there are certain forms and degrees of them, which have not been exempted from the scorn of the unthinking. That extensive generosity, and high public spirit, which prompt a man to iacrifice his own interelt, in order to promote some great general good; and that ftrid and scrupulous integrity, which will not allow one, on any occasion, to depart from the truth; have often been treated with contempt by those who are called men of the world. They wh ,will not sloop to flatter the great; who diidain to comply with prevailing manners, when 4heyijudge them t9 be evil; who refuli to take the fiuallll adva.gepf.others, in order tq.procure the. glreief:benefit.for ttemuelvea; are repref~ert ;as.pearn ,of romantic romantic characer, and visionary notions,  unacquainted with the world, and unfit XVIII."
"Such persons are so far from being liable to any just ridicule, that they are intitled to a degree of refpet, which approaches to veneration. For they are, in truth, the great supporters and guardians of public order. The authority of their characer overawes the giddy multitude. The weight of their example retards the progress of corruption; checks that relaxation of morals, which is always too apt to gain ground insensibly, and to make incroachments on every department of society. Accordingly, it is this high generosity of spirit, this inflexible virtue, this regard to principle, fuperior to all opinion, which has ever marked the characters of those who have eminently distinguished themselves in public life; who have patronised the cause of juslice against powerful oppressors; who, in critical times, have supported the falling rights and liberties of men; and have refleded honour on their nation and country."
"Such ER Such persons may have been scoffed at by  . fIome among whom they lived; but pofterity has done them ample justice; and they are the persons, whose names are recorded to future ages, and who are thought and spoken of with admiration."
"The mere temporizer, the man of accommodating principles, and inferior virtue, may support a plausible character for a while among his friends and followers; but as soon as the hollowness of his principles is detected, he finks into contempt."
"They who are prone to deride men of inflexible integrity, only betray the littlenef of their minds. They ihow that they underftand not the sublime of virtue; that thev have no discernment of the true excellence of man, By asseting to throw any discouragement on purity and strisnels of morals, they not only expose themselves to just contempt, but propagate fentiments very dangerous to society. For, if we loosen the regard due to virtue in any cf its parts, we begin to sap the whole of it. No man, as it has been often said, becomes comes entirely profligate at once. He deo viates, ftep by ftep, from conscience. If i_."
"the loose caluiftry of the scoffer were to prevail, open difhonelty, falsehood, and treachery, would speedily grow out of thoft complying principles, those relaxations of virtue, which he would reprelent to be neceflary for every man who knows the world."
"THs lift class of virtues I am to men."
"tion, are those which are of a personal nature, and which refped the government to be exercised over our pleasures and passions."
"Here, the scoffer has always confidered himself as having an ample field. Often, and often, have such virtues as fobriet, temperance, modesty, and chastity, been made the subject of ridicule, as monkish habits, which exclude men from the company of the faihionable and the gay; ha."
"bits, which are the cffcd of low education, or of mean spirits, or of mere feebleness of constitUtion; while (coflrs, walking, as it is too truly said of then by the Apoltle, after  Ill. c /I,.;:"
"SERM their luJft, boast of their own manners as XVII. liberal and free, as manly and spirited."
"They fancy themselves raised thereby much above the crowd; and hold all those in contempt, who confine themselves within the vulgar bounds of regular and orderly life."
"Infatuated men! who fee not that the virtues of which they make sport, not only derive their authority from the laws of God, but are moreover essentially requisite both to public, and to private happiness."
"By the indulgence of their licentious pleafures for a.while, as long as youth and vigour remain, a few pairing gratifications may be obtained. But what are the confequences ? Suppose any individual to persevere unrestrained in this course, it is certainly to be followed by disrepute in his charader, and disorder in his affairs; by a wafted and broken conflitution; and a speedy and miserable old age. Suppose a society to be wholly formed of such persons as the scoffers applaud; suppose it to be filled with none but those whom they call the sons of pleasure; that is, with the intemperate, the riotous, and diflilute, among "
"whom all regard to lobriety, decency, and xvIII."
"private virtue, was aboli:hd,; what an odious fceine would such a iociety exhibit ? How unluie any civilised or well-ordered state, in wiich mankind have chosen to dwell What turbulence and uproar, what contests and quarrels, would perpetually reign in it ? What man of common underltanding would not rather chufe to dwell in a "
"fert, than to be alrociated for life with such companions ? Shall, then, the scoffer prefume to make light of those virtues, without which there could be neither peace, nor comfort, nor good order, among mankind ?"
"Let him be desired to think, of his do."
"meltic situation and connections. Is he a father, a husband, or a brother ? Has he any friend or relation, male or female, in whose happiness he is intereited ?- Let us put the question to him, whether he be willing that intemperance, unchastity, or dilfipation of any kind, flould mark their charafter ? Would he recommend to them c 2 such  such excesses ? Would he chufe, in their tI_ ,presence, openly, and without disguise, to scoff at the opposite virtues, as of no consequence to their welfare ?- If even the most licentious lmudders at the thought; if, in the midst of his loo pleafuires, he be desirous that his own family lhould remain untainted; let this teach him the valuc of those private virtues, which, in the hours of dissipation, in the giddiness of his mind, he is ready to contemn. Baniih sobriety, temperance, and purity, and you tear up the foundations of all public order, and all domestic quiet. You render every house a divided and miserable abode, refounding with terms of ihame, and mutual reproaches of infamy. You leave nothing refpecable in the human charader. You change the man into a brute."
"THE conclusion from all the reasonings which we have now pursued is, that religion and virtue, in all their forms, either of doctrine or of precept; of piety towards God, integrity towards men, or regularity in in private conduct; are so far from afford- ER any grounds of ridicule to the petulant,  that they are intitled to our highest veneration; they are names, which should never be mentioned, but with the utmost honour. It is said in Scripture, Fools make a mock at fin *. They had better make a mock at pestilence, at war, or famine."
"With one, who should chufe these public calamities for the fubjedt of his sport, you would not be inclined to associate. You would fly from him, as worse than a fool; as a man of distempered mind, from whom you might be in hazard of receiving a fudden blow. Yet certain it is, that, to the great fbciety of mankind, fin is a greater calamity, than either pestilence, or famine, or war. These operate, only as occasional causes of misery. But the fins and vices of men, are perpetual scourges of the world, Impiety and injustice, fraud and falsehood, intemperance and profligacy, are daily producing mischief and disorder; bringing * rov. xiv. 9."
"C ruin GERM ruin on individuals; tearing families and XVIII."
"communities in pieces; giving rife to a thousand tragical kcenes on this unhappy theatre. In proportion as manners are vicious, mankind are unhappy, The perfedion of virtue which reigns in the world above, is the chief source of the perfeca blessedness which prevails there."
"When, therefore, we observe any tendency to treat religion or morals with difresped and levity, let us hold it to be a sure indication of a perverted understanding, or a depraved heart. In the feat of the scorner let us never fit. Let us account that wit contaminated, which attempts to sport itself on sacred fubjces. When the scoffer arifis, let us rraintain the honour of our God, and our Redeemer; and resolutely adhere to the cause of virtue and goodness. The rlps of the uwif utter knowledge; but the mouth of the foolfh iJ near to delruilion. Him that bonoureth God, God will honour. Thefear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom : and be that keepeth the commandment, keepctt his tWnI foul."
"# SERMON XIX. On the CREATION of the WORLD. GENESIS, i. 1. In the beginning God created the heaven, and the earth."
"On the CREATION of the WORLD."
"In the beginning God created the heaven, and the earth."
"SUCH is the commencement of the his- "
"tory of mankind; an aera, to which we __ must ever look back with solemn awe and veneration. Before the fun and the moon had begun their course; before the found of the human voice was heard, or the name of man was known; in the beginning God created the heaven, and the earth.To a beginning of the world, we are led back by every thing that now exists; by all history, all records, all monuments of c 4 antiquity."
"SFR  antiquity. In tracing the tranfadions of XLX."
"_LLf, pafl ages, we arrive at a period, which clearly indicates the infancy of the human race."
"W behold the world peopled by degrees."
"We ascend to the origin of all those useful and necefiary arts, without the knowledge of which, mankind could hardly subsist."
"We discern society and civilization arising from rude beginnings, in every corner of the earth; and gradually advancing to the ftatc in which we now find them: All which afford plain evidence, that there was a period, when mankind began to inhabit and cultivate the earth. What is very rewarkable, the moll authentic chronology aid hitory of molt nations, coincides with the account of Scripture; and makes the period during which the world has been inhabited by the race of men, not to ex;end beyond fix thousand years."
"To the ancient philosophers, creation from nothing appearod aa unintelligible idea. They maintained the eternal existence.of matter, which they supposed to be modelled by the Ibvcreign mind of the universe, into the form which the earth now exhibits. But there is nothing in this opi- xlx."
"nion which gives it any title to be opposed to the authority of revelation. The doctrine of two felf-exiftent, independent principles, God and matter, the one active, the other passive, is a hypothesis which presents difficulties to human rcafon, at leait as great as the creation of matter from nothing. Adhering then to the testimony of Scripture, we believe, that in the beginning God created, or from non-existence brought into being, she heaven and the earth."
"But though there was a period when this globe, with all that we fee upon it, did not exist, we have no reason to think, that the wisdom and power of the Almighty were then without exercise or employment."
"Bouudlels is the extent of his dominion."
"Other globes and worlds, enlightened by other funs, may then have occupied, as they still appear to occupy, the immense regions of space. Numberless orders of beings, to us unknown, people the wide extent of the universe; and afford an endless variety 6  variety of objects to the ruling care of the .lx great Father of all. At length, in the course and progress of his government, there arrived a period, when this earth was to be called into existence. When the fignal moment, predestined from all eternity, was come, the Deity arose in his might; and with a word created the world. What an illustrious moment was that, when, from non-existence, there sprang at once into being, this mighty globe, on which so many millions of creatures now dwell!-No preparatory measures were required. No long circuit of means was employed. He fpak; and it was done: He commanded; and it fJood faf. The earth was at first, without form, and void; and darkntja was on theface of the deep. The Almighty surveyed the dark abyss; and fixed bounds to the several divisions of nature. He siid, Let there be light; and there was light. Then appeared the sea, and the dry land. The mountains rose; and the rivers flowed. The fun and moon began their course in the ikies. Herbs and plants cloathed cloathed the ground. The air, the earth, "
"and the waters, were storcd with their Xt._ fpecive inhabitants. At last, man was made after the image of God. He appeared, walking with countenance erea; and received his Creator benediction, as the Lord of this new world. The Almighty beheld his work when it was finished; and pronounced it good. Superior beings saw with wonder this new acceflion to existence."
"The morning fars fang together; and all the sons of God Jhoutedfor joy *."
"But, on this great work of creation, let us not merely gaze with astonishment. Let us confider how it fliould affect our condud, by presenting the divine perfections in a light which is at once edifying, and comforting, to man. It displays the Creator as supreme in power, in wisdom, and in goodness."
"I. As supreme in power. When we confider with how much labour and difficulty * Job xiviii. 7."
"human  human power performs its inconsiderable .a works; what time it cofis to rear them; "
"and how easily, when reared, they are destroyed; the very idea of creating power overwhelms the mind with awe. Let us look around, and survey this stupendous edifice, which we have been admitted to inhabit. Let us think of the extent of the different climates and regions of the earth; of the magnitude of the mountains, and of the expanse of the ocean. Let us conceive that immense globe which contains them, launched at once from the hand of the Almighty; made to revolve incessantly on its axis, that it might produce the vicissitudes of day and night; thrown forth, at the fame time, to run its annual course in perpetual circuit through the heavens; after such a meditation, where is the greatness, where is the pride of man ? Into what total annihilation do we fink, before an omnipotent Being ? Who is not disposed to exclaim, Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him ; or the son ns man, that tboujhouldf it him When compared wtitb thee, all men are vanity ; "
"vanity; tbhir works arc nothing.-- Reve- SE, Ml rence, and humble adoration, ought 1potl- taneouly to arise. He who feels no propenfity to worship and adore, is dead to all sense of grandeur and majesty; has extinguiihed one of the nmof natural feelings of the human heart. Kn the Lord, that he is God, we are all his people; thb workmanjhip of his bands. Let ts worJhip and bow down. Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker."
"Of all titles to legislation and rule, none is so evident and direct as that of a Creator. The convicion is felt in every breast, that he who gave us being, hath an abfolute right to regulate our conduct This gives a fanCion to the precepts of God, which the most hardened dare not controvert. When it is a Creator and a Father that speaks, who would not liften and obey? Are justice and humanity his declared laws; and fliall we, whom but yefterday he called from the dust, and whom to-morrow he can reduce into dust again, presume, in contempt of him, to be unjust or BERM. or inhuman? Are there any little interelts Ms_ of our own which we dare to erect, in opposition to the pleasure of him who made us? Fear ye not me, faitb the Lord; will ye not tremble at my prefnce, who have placed the Sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pss it; who firetch Jortb my band over the earth, and none binderethb At the fame time, the power of a Creator is encouraging, as well as awful. While it enforces duty, it inspires confidence under alHiction. It brings to view a relation, which imports tenderness and comfort; for it suggests the compassion of a father. In the time of trouble, mankind are led by natural impulle, to fly for aid to Him, who knows the weakness of the frame which he has made; who remembers we are dufl; and fees the dangers with which we are environed.  I am thine; for thou haft made  me; Forsake not the work of tlline own hands, is one of the molt natural ejaculations of the distressed mind.- How bleffed are the virtuous, who can reft under the protection proteftion of that powerful arm, which "
"made the earth and the heaven? The omnipotence which renders God so awful, is to them a source of joy. In the whole compass of nature, nothing is formidable to them, who firmly repose their trust in the Creator. To them, every noxious power can be rendered harmless; every threatened evil, if not averted, can be transformed into good. In the Author of nature, they find not only the author of their being; but their protector and defender, the lifter up of their heads. Happy is he that bath the God of Jacob for bis help; wbofe bope is in the Lord his God; which made heaven and earth, the fa, and all that therein is; 'which keepeth truth for ever ."
"II. THE work of creation is the display of supreme wisdom. It carries no character more conspicuous than this. If, from the firudture and mechanism of some of the mofi complicated works of human art, we are led Psalm cxlvi. 5. 6."
"to  to high admiration of the wisdom of the __ contriver, what aftoniflunent may fill our minds, when we think of the ftrucure of the univere ! It is not only the stupendous building itself, which excites admiration; but the exquisite skill, with which the endless variety of its parts are adapted to their refpetive purposes. Insomuch, that the study of nature, which, for ages, has employed the lives of Ib many learned men, and which is still Ib far from being exhaufted, is no other than the Rtudy of divine wisdom displayed in the creation. The farther our researches are carried, more striking proofs of it every where meet us."
"The provision made for the constant regularity of the universe, in the disposition of the heavenly bodies, so that in the course of several thousand years, nature should ever exhibit the fame useful and grateful variety, in the returns of light and darkness, of summer and winter; and ever furnifh food and habitation to all the animals that people the earth; must be a lalling theme of wonder to every refleting mind."
"But But they are not oniy the heavens that "
"decltarr the glory of God, and the finnament  that Jsiewetb forth his bandy wor. In the most inconiiderable, as well as in the most illuitrious works of the Creator, confunmmate art and design appear. There is not a creature that moves, nor a vegetable that grows, but, when minutely examined, furnihes materials of the highest admiration. The lame wisdom that placed the fun in the centre of the system, and arranged the feveral planets around him in their order, has no less Thown itself, in the provision made for the food and dwelling of every bird that roams the air, and every beat that wanders in the desert; equally great, in the smallest, and in the most magnificent objects; in the star, and in the inset; in the elephant, and in the fly; in the beam that thines from heaven, and in the grass that cloaths the ground. Nothing is overlooked. Nothing is carelessly performed."
"Every thing that exists, is adapted with perfef symmetry to the end for which it was designed. All this infinite variety of parVOL. 11. d ticular ticulars must have been prefcnt to the mind XIX."
"a-  of the Creator; all beheld with one glance of hit eye; all fixed and arranged, from the beginning, in his great design, when he formed the heavens and the earth. Justly may we exclaim with the Pfalmint, How excellent, 0 Lord, is /hy name in all the earbth How manifold are thy works ! In i/dom Lfi tbou made them all. A man can Jind out the work that God maketb, from the beginning to the end. Sucb knowledge is too wonderjiul for ur. It is bigb; we cannot attain unto it."
"This wisdom displayed by the Almighty in the creation, was not intended merely to gratify curiosity, and to raise wonder. It ought to beget profound fubmiflion, and pious trust, in every heart. It is not uncomalon for many who speak with rapture of creating wisdom, to be guilty, at the fame time, of arraigning the conduc of Providence. In the ftrufture of the universe, they confers that all is goodly and beautiful. But in the government of human asfairs, they can fee nothing but diobrder and confufion,-Have they forgotten, that both both the one, and the other, proceed from "
"the fame author ? Have they forgotten, that _ he who balanced all the heavenly bodies, and adjusted the proportions and limits of nature, is the fame who hath allotted them their condition in the world, who diftributes the measures of their prosperity and adversity, and fixes the bounds of their habitation ? If their lot appear to them ill forted, and their condition hard and unequal, let them only put the question to their own minds, Whether it be most probable, that the great and wife Creator hath erred in his distribution of human things, or that they have erred, in the judgement which they form concerning the lot afflgned to them? Can they believe, that the divine Artist, after he had contrived and frnished this earth, the habitation of men, with such admirable wisdom, would then throw it out of his hands as a neglected work; would fulffer the affairs of its inhabitants to proceed by chance; and would behold them without concern, running into mifnile and disorder? Where were then that consistenD d2 cy RM. cy of conduct, which we discover in all the ' works of nature, and which we cannot but ascribe to a perfect Being ?- My brother!"
"when thy plans are disappointed, and thy heart is ready to despair; when virtue is oppressed, and the wicked prosper around thee; in those moments of disturbance, look up to him who created the heaven and the earth; and confide, that he who made light to spring from primaval darkness, will make order at last to arise from the seeming confulion of the world."
"Had any one beheld the earth in its state of chaos; when the elements lay mixed and confused; when the earth was withoutform and void, and darknlef wa on the face of the deep; would he have believed, that it was presently to become so fair and well ordered a globe as we now behold; illumined with the splendor of the fun, and decorated with all the beauty of nature? The fame powerful hand, which perse the work of creation, (hall, in due time, disembroil the plans of Providence. Of creation, we can judge more clearly, because it Rood forth at at once; it was perse& from the beginning. "
"But the course of Providence is progreflive. "
"Time is required for the progression to advnnee; and before it is finiihed, we can form no judgement, or at least a very imperset one, concerning it. We must wait until the great :ra arrive, when the secrets of the universe shall be unfolded; when the divine designs {hall be consummated; when Providence shalt be brought to the fame completion which creation has already attained. Then, we have every reason to believe, that the wife Crector {hall apper in the end, to have been the wife and jtft tuler of the world. Until that period come, let us be conrented and patient; let uis rubmit and adore. Although tbou fayeft tbou Jba fotfte him, yet judgement i before bim; tberefore, ttarf tou in him*, This exhortation will receive more force, when we, "

" power. It is the communication of numXIX  berlefs benefits to all who live, together with existence. Justly is the earth said to befull of the goodness of the Lord. Throughout the whole system of things, we behold a manifest tendency to promote the benefit either of the rational, or the animal creation. In some parts of nature, this tendency may be less obvious than in others. Objests, which to us seem useless, or hurtful, may sometimes occur; and strange it were, if in so vast and complicated a system, difficulties of this kind lhould not occasionally present themselves to beings, whose views are so narrow and limited as ours. It is well known, that in proportion as the knowledge of nature has increased among men, there difficulties have diminished. Satisfactory accounts have been given of many perplexing appearances. Useful and proper purposes have been found to be promoted, by objects which were, at first, thought unprofitable or noxious."
"Malignant must be the mind of that person; with a distorted eye he must have contemplated templated creation, who can fufpet, that RM."
"it is not the production of infinite benignity and goodness. How many clear marks of benevolent intention appear, every where around us ? What a profusion of beauty and ornament is poured forth on the face of nature? What a magnificent spectacle presented to the view of man? What supply contrived for his wants ? What a variety of objects let before him, to gratify his senses, to employ his understanding, to entertain his imagination, to cheer and gladden his heart? Indeed, the very exiltence ,of;the universe is a flanding memorial qs the goodness of the Creator. For nothing exr cept goodaefs could originally prompt creation. The supreme Being, felf-exitent and all-fuflicient, had no wants which he could seek to supply. No new acceflion of felicity or glory was to result to him, from creatures whom he made. It was goodness communicating and pouring itself forth, goodness delighting to impart happiness in all its forms, which in the beginning created die heaven and the earth. Hence, "

Whereever there is lite, there is foine degree of happiness; there are enjoyments suited to the different powers of feeling; and earth, and air, and water, are, with magnificent liberality, made to teem with life."
"Let those fttriking displays of creating goodness call forth, on our part, responsive love, gratitude, and veneration. To this great Father of all existence and life, to Him who hath raised us up to behold the light of day, and to enjoy all the comforts which his world prefeats, let our hearts fend forth a perpetual hymn of praise."
"Evening and morning let us celebrate Him, who maketh the morning and the evening to rejoice over our heads; who openethb bi hand, and /atisfitb the desire of every living thing. Let us rejoice, that we are brought into a world, which is the production of infinite goodness; over which a supreme intelligence presides; and where nothing happens, "

"ged, from the beginning, in his decree. X1X."
"vinced that he hateth not the works which he hath made, nor hath brought creatures into existence, merely to susser unnecessary pain, let us, even in the midit of sorrow, receive, with calm fubmiTlion, whatever he is pleased to fend; thankful for what he betlows; and satisfied, that, without good reason, he takes nothing away."
"SUCH, in general, are the effects which meditation on the creation of the world ought to produce. It presents such an atonilhing conjunction of power, wisdom, and goodness, as cannot be beheld without religious veneration Accordingly, among all nations of the earth, it has given rife to religious belief and worfiip. The most ignorant and savage tribes, when they looked round on the earth and the heavens, could not avoid ascribing their origin to some invisible designing cause, and feeling a propensity to adore. They are, indeed, the awful appearances of the Cretoi power, "
"by ERM, by which, chiefly, they have been impreirf X1X  and which have introduced into their worship so many rites of dark superitltion."
"When the usual course of nature leemuid to be interrupted; when loud thunder rolled above them in the clouds, or earthquakes shook the ground, the multitude fell on their knees, and, with trembling horror, brought forth the bloody sacrifice to appease the angry divinity. But it is not in those tremendous appearances of power merely, that a good and well-inftruced man beholds the Creator of the world. In the constant and regular working of his hands, in the silent operations of his wisdom and goodness, ever going on throughout nature, he delights to contemplate and adore him."
"This is one of the chief fruits to be derived from that more perfec knowledge of the Creator, which is imparted to us by the Christian revelation. Impressing our minds with a just sense of all his attributes, as not wife and great only, but as gracious and merciful, let it lead us to view every object of of calm and undisturbed nature, with a perpetual reference to its author. We {hall  then behold all the tcenes which the heavens and the earth present, with more refined feelings, and sublimer emotions than they who regard them solely as objects of curiosity, or amutfement. Nature will appear animated, and enlivened, by the prefence of its author. When the fun rife#"
"or sets in the heavens; when spring paints the earth, when summer shines in its glory, when autumn pours forth its fruits, or winter returns in its awful forms, we shall view the Creator manifesting himself in his works. We shall meet his presence in the fields. We shall feel his influence in the cheering beam. We hall hear his voice in the wind. We hall behold ourselves every where surrounded with the glory of that universal spirit, who fills, pervades, and upholds all. We hall live in the world as in a great and august temple; where the presence of the divinity, who inhabits it, inspires devotion."
"Magnificent as the fabric of the world is, "
"BERM. is, it was not, however, intended for per][IX. ,_-' petual duration. It was erected as a temporary habitation for a race of beings, who, after acting there a probationary part, were to be removed into a higher state of existence. As there was an hour fixed from all eternity for its creation, so there is an hour fixed for its dissolution; when the heavens and the earth shall pass away, and their place {hall know them no more. The confideration of this great event, as the counterpart to the work of creation, ihall be the fubje& of the following Discourse."

"THESE words present to us an awful SERl'"
"view of the final catastrophe of the ._ world. Having treated, in the preceding Discourse, of the commencement, let us now contemplate the close, of all human things. The dissolution of the material fyfltem is an article of our faith, often alluded   ded to in the Old Testament, clearly prexx. diced in the New. It is an article of faith so far from being incredible, that many appearances in nature lead to the belief of it. We fee all terrestrial substances changing their form. Nothing that conflits of matter, is formed for perpetual duration."
"Every thing around us, is impaired and consumcd by time; waxes old by degrees, and tends to decay. There is rcalbn, therefore, to believe, that a Itrudure lo complex as the world mutt be liable to the fame law; and lhall, at some period, undergo the fame fate. Through many changes, the earth has already passed; many thocks it has received, and fill is often receiving. A great portion of what is now dry land appears, from various tokens, to have been once covered with water. Continents bear the marks of having been violently rent, and torn asunder from one another. New islands have risen from the bottom of the ocean; thrown up by the force of fubterraneous fire. Formidable earthquakes have, in divers quarters, lhaken the globe; and at at this hour terrify, with their alarms, ma- ."
"xx ny parts of it. Burning mountains have, _ for awes, been difchargine torrents of flame; and from time to time renew their explosions, in various regions. All these circumstances lhow, that in the bowels of the earth, the instruments of its dissolution are formed. To our view, who behold only its surface, it may appear firm and unihaken; while its defiruclion is preparing in secret. The ground on which we tread is undermined. Combuflible materials are stored. The train is laid. When the mine is to spring, none of us can foresee."
"Accustomed to behold the course of nature proceeding in regular order, we indulge, meanwhile, our pleasures and pursuits with tull ecurity; and such awful scenes as the convulsion of the elements, and the dissolution of the world, are soreign to our thoughts. Yet, as it is certain that some generation of men mull witness this great catastrophe, it is fit and proper that we should sometimes look forward to it. Such prolpets may not, indeed, be al."

"a grandeur and lolemnity, which are congenial to some of the most dignified feelings in our nature; and tend to produce elevation of thought. Amidt the circle of levities and follies, of little pleasures and little cares, which fill up the ordinary round of life, it is necessary that we be occasionally excited to attend to what is serious and great. Such events as are now to be the subjec of our meditation, awake the slumbering mind; check the licentioufnefi of idle thought, and bring home our recollection to what most concerns us, as men and Christians."
"Let us think what astonishment would have filled our minds, and what devout etotions would have swelled our hearts, if we could have been fpecators of the creation of the world; if we had seen the earth when it arose at first withoetform and eid, and beheld its parts arranged by the divine word; if we had heard the voice of the Almighty, calling light to spring forth from the darkns that was on face of the deep; if if we had seen the fun arising, for the first time, in the east with majestic glory; and all nature instantly beginning to teem with life. This wonderful scene, it was impoffible that any human eye could behold. It was a fpedacle afforded only to angels, and superior spirits. But to a fpeAacle no less aftonilhing, the final dissolution of the world, we know there {hall be many human witnesses. The race of men living in that last age, shall fee the presages of the approaching fatal day.

"SERMI. I. CONTEMPLATE the Supreme Being -_.. directing the diliblution, as he directed the original formation, of the world. He is the great agent in this wonderful tranfaction. It was by him foreicen. It was by him intendedl; it entered into his plan from the moment of creation. This world was dettined from the beginning to fulfil a certain period; and then its duration was to terminate. Not that it is any pleasure to the Almighty, to di(play his omnipotence in destroying the works which he has made; but as for wile and good purposes the earth was formed, so for wile and good ends it is dilrolved, when the time most proper for its termination is come.

"their present habitation thould be made to xx."
"pafls away. Of the seasonableness of the period when this change should take place, no being can judge, except the Lord of the universe. These are counsels, into which it is not ours to penetrate. But amidst this great revolution of nature, our comfort is, that it is a revolution brought about by Him, the measures of whose government are all founded in goodness."
"It is called in the text, the day of te Lord; "
"a day peculiarly his, as known to lhim only; a day in which he ihall appear with uncommon and tremendous majesty. But though it be the day of the terrors of the Lord, yet from theft terrors, his upright and faithful fubjeds liall have nothing to apprehend. They may remain safe and quiet fpedtators of the threatening scene."
"For it is not to be a scene of blind confu, sion; of universal ruin, brought about by undesigning chance. Over the ihock of the elements, and the wreck of nature, Eternal Wisdom presides. According to its 2 direction, "
" direction, the conflagration advances which XX_ is to consume the earth. Amidst every convulsion of the world, God shall continue to be, as he was from the beginning, the dwelling-place of bis servants to all generations.

The righteous Lord lovetb rigbteoufness; and under every period of his government, bis countenance beholdeth the upright."
"II. LET us contemplate the dissolution of the world, as the end of all human glory."
"This earth has been the theatre of many a great fpeaacle, and many a high atchievement. There, the wife have ruled, the mighty have fought, and conquerors have triumphed. Its surface has been covered with proud and stately cities. Its temples and palaces have raised their heads to the skies. Its kings and potentates, glorying in their magnificence, have ereced pyramids, conftruted towers, founded monuments, which they imagined were to defy  xx."
"all the alfaults of time. Their inward _ tbought was, that their bouses were to continu for ever, and their dwellig-places to all generations. Its philosophers have explored the secrets of nature; and flattered themselves, that the fame of their discoveries was to be immortal. Alas ! all this was no more than a transient ihow. Not only the faJbion of the world, but the world itself, pajfeth away. The day cometh, when all the glory of this world shall be remembered, only as a dream when one awaketh."
"No longer shall the earth exhibit any of those scenes which now delight our eyes."
"The whole beautiful fabric is thrown down, never more to arise. As soon as the destroying angel has founded the last trumpet, the everlasting mountains fall; the foundations of the world are ihaken; the beauties of nature, the decorations of art, the labours of induilry, periih in one common flame, The globe itself ihall either return into its ancient chaos, without form and void; or, like a star fallen from the e 3 heavens, "
" hcavcns, shall be effaced from the universe, "
"and its plare shall know it no more."
"THIS day of the Lord, it is foretold in the text, will come as a thief in the night; that is, sudden and unexpected. Mankind, notwithstanding the presages given them, ihall continue to the last in their wonted security. Our Saviour tells us, that as in the days of Noah before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, Yntil the flood came, and took them all away; foJhall also the coming of the Son of tan be .- How many projeits and designs shall that day iuddenly confound?"
"What long-contrived schemes of pleasure ihall it overthrow? What plans of cunning and ambition shall it utterly blast? How iiferable they, whom it shall overtake in the midst of dark conspiracies, of criminal deeds, or profligate pleasures? In what firong colours is their dismay painted, when they are represented in the book of Revelations, as calling to the bills and mountains to fall on them and cver them? --Such  _ scriptions are apt to be confidered as exaggerated. The imprellion of those awful events is weakened by the great diftancc of time, at which our imagination places them. But have not we had a striking image set before us, in our own age, of the terrors which the day of the Lord ihall produce, by those partial ruins of the world, which the vlfitation of God has brought on countries well known, and not removed very far froth ourselves ? When in the midst of peace, opulence, aid security, suddenly the earth was felt by the terrified inhabitants to tremble, with violent agitation, below them; when their houses began to shake over their heads, and to overwhelm them with ruins; the flood, at the fame time, to rife from its bed, and to swell around them; when encompassed with universal desolation, no friend could aid another; no prospect of escape appeared; no place of refuge remained; how similar were such scenes of defiruntion to the terrors of the lat day?"
"E 4 What  What finilar sensations of dread, and rexx. -,._ morse, and too late repentance, must they have excited among the guilty and profane ?"
"To such formidable convulsions  nature, we, in these happy islands, through the blessing of Heaven, are strangers; and strangers to them may we long continue!"
"But however we may escape partial ruins of the globe, in its general and final ruin, we also muff be involved. To us must come at last that awful day, when the fun shall for the last time arise, to perform his concluding circuit round the world. They how blest, whom that day ihall find employed in religious aAs, or virtuous deeds; in the conscientious discharge of the duties of life; in the exercise of due preparation for the conclusion of human things, and for appearing before the great Judge of the world! Let us now, "
"III. CONTEMPLATE the foul of man, as remaining unhurt in the midst of this general desolation, when the whole animal crea."
"tion perishes, and the whole frame of na- "
"ture falls into ruins. What a high idea xx does this present, of the dignity pertaining to the rational spirit! The world may fall back into chaos; but, superior to matter, and independent of all the changes of material things, the foul continues the fame."
"When the heavens pass away with a great noir, and the klement melt with fervent beat, the foul of man, stamped for immortality, retains its state unimpaired; and is capable offlourishing in undecaying youth and vigour. Very different indeed the condition of human spirits is to be, according as their different qualities have marked, and prepared them, for different future mansions. But for futurity, they are all deftined. Existence, still, is theirs. The capacity of permanent felicity they all pof fess; and, if they enjoy it not, it is owing to themselves."
"Here then, let us behold what is the true honour and excellence of man. It confifls not in his body; which, beautiful or vigorous as it may now seem, is no other than a SE kM. a fabrick of dust, quicklyto return to;dmft ,__ again. Iris not derived ftom any connection he can form with earthly things; which, as we have seen, are all doomed to perilh."
"It c6lofifts in that thinking part, which is ffffcepfible of intellecdual improvetent and moral worth; which was fortned after the image of God; which is capable of peretual progress in drawing nearer to his hature; and shall partalke of the divine eternity, when time and the world shall be no'
more. This is all that is refpetable in man.'
By this alone, he is raised above perishable substances, and allied to those that are celeftial and immortal. This part of our na; ture, then, let us cultivate with care; andi on its improvement, reft our felf-eftimatirn.
If, on the contrary, fufifring ourfeltes to be wholly immersed in matter, plunged in the dregs of fenfualiky we behhve as if we were only made for the body and its anim real pleasures, how degenerate and bas edo we become ? Destined to fhrvire this whole material system, sent forth to rin the race of immortality and glory, shall we thus'abnfe our our Maker goodness, degrade our origi- 
nal honour, and fink ourselves into defer- _XX ved misery? It remains, that,   WE contemplate the dissolution of the world, as the introducion to a greater and nobler lyfttm, in the government of God. We, acrording to bis promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth rightrofteSfi *. Temporal things are now to give place to things eternal. To this earthly habitation is to succeed the city of the living God. The earth had completed the purpose for which it was created.
It had been employed as a theatre, on which the human generations were successively to come forth, and to fulfil their term of trial.
As long as the period of trial continued, much obscurity was of course to cover the counrels of Providence. It was appointed, that all things should appear as coming alike to all; that the righteous should seem often neglected by Heaven, and the wicked be * a Peter, iii. 1.

allowed allowed externally to profpcr; in order that As_, virtue and piety might undergo a proper tef; that it might be ihown who were fincere adherents to conscience, and who were mere followers of fortune. The day which terminates the duration of the world, terminates all those teeming disorders. The time of trial is concluded. The final difcrimination of characers is made. When the righteous go to everlasting happiness, and the wicked are dismissed into the regions of puniihment, the whole mystery of human affairs is unravelled; and the condut of Providence is jultified to man.

Suited to a condition of trial was the state and form of the world, which we now in.
habit. It was not designed to be a mansion for innocent and happy spirits; but a dwelling for creatures of fallen nature, and of mixed characters. Hence, those mixtures of pleasure and pain, of disorder and beauty, with which it abounds. Hence, some regions of the earth, prefentinggay and pleasing scenes; others, exhibiting nothing but ruggcdnefs and deformity; the face of nature, 
nature, sometimes brightened by a serene atmosphere, and a splendid fun; sometimes XX.
disfigured by jarring elements, and overcast with troubled skies. But far unlike shall be the everlasting habitations of the just: Though how they are formed, or what objects they contain, is not given us now to conceive; nor, in all probability, would our faculties be equal to the conception. The emblematical descriptions of them in Scripture, are calculated to excite high ideas of magnificence and glory. This one particular we know with certainty, that therein dwelletb righteousness; that is, complete virtue and eternal order; and whereever there are found, the molt perfec sources are opened of joy and bliss. This earth was never intended for more than the outer court, the porch, through which the righteous were to pass into the temple and fanduary of the Divinity. When that which is perfct is come, that which is in partJhall be done away.

THE inference which follows from what has  has been said on this subjet, cannot be so Xx.  well exprcffcd as in the words of the Apostle, 
in the verse immediately following the text; feeing that all theft things Jball be dirolved, what manner of person ought we to be in all holy conversation and godlinefi? Ought not the important discoveries which have been made to us, of the designs of the Almighty, and of the destiny of man, to exalt our feno timents, and to purify our life from what is vitious or vain? While we purlfu the bufinefa and cares of our present station, and partake of the innocent pleasures which the world affords, let us maintain that dignity of charader, which becomes immortal beings; let us as with that circumfpeclion, which becomes those who know they are soon to stand before the judgement-feat of the Son of God: In a word, let us study to be what we would wish to be found, if to us the day of the Lord should come.

I KNOW it will occur, that the profped of that day cannot be expe to have much influence on the present age. The events of of which I have treated, must needs, it will 
be said, belong to fume future race of men. _ Many prophecies yet remain to be fulfilled.
Many preparatory events must take place, before the world is ripe for final judgement.
-Whether this be the cafe or not, none of us with certainty know.-But allow me to remind you, that to each of us, an event is approaching, and not far distant, which liall prove of the fame effeA, with the coming of the day of the Lord. The day of death is, to every individual, the fame as the day of the dissolution of the world.
The fun may continue to shine; but to them who are laid in the grave, his light is finally extiguiflied. The world may remain active, busy, and noisy; but to them, all is silence. The voice which gives the mandate, Return again to your duJf, is the fame with the found of the last trumpet.
Death fixes the doom of every one, finally and irrevocably. This surely is an event which none of us can remove in our thoughts to a remote age. To-morrow, to-day, the fatal mandate may be if sued.
  sued. Watch therefore; be fober and vigi_ _· lant; ye know not at what hour the Son of Man cometb.

HAVING now treated both of the creation and dissolution of the world, I cannot conclude, without calling your thoughts to the magnificent view, which these events give us, of the kingdom and dominion of the Almighty. With reverence we contemplate his hand in the signal difpenfations of Providence among men; deciding the fate of battles; raising up, or overthrowing empires; calling down the proud, and lifting the low from the dust. But what are such occurrences to the power and wisdom, which He displays in the higher revolutions of the universe; by his word, forming, or dissolving worlds; at his pleasure, transplanting his creatures from one world to another; that he may carry on new plans of wisdom and goodness, and fill all space with the wonders of creation !
Successive generations of men have arisen to possess the earth. By turns they have pased passed away, and gone into regions un- 
known. Us he hath raised up, to occupy - 
their room. We too shall shortly disappear.
But human existence never perifies. Life only changes its form, and is renewed.
Creation is ever filling, but never full.
When the whole intended course of the generations of men shall be finished, then, as a shepherd leads his flock from one pasture to another, so the great Creator leads forth the fouls which he has made, into new and prepared abodes of life. They go from this earth to a new earth, and new heavens; and still they remove, only from one province of the divine dominion to another.
Amidst all those changes of nature, the great Ruler himself remains, without variableneJf ,,rbhadow of turning. To him, these fucceflive revolutions of being are but as yesterday when it is pqft. From his eternal throne, he beholds worlds rising and passing away; measures out, to the creatures who inhabit them, powers and faculties suited to their state; and distributes among them rewards and punishments, proportioned to their acVOL.

"JEREMIAH xlix. 11. Leave thy fatherless children; I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me."
"NO subject is more open to general observation, or more confirmed by manifold experience, than the goodness of God. The contemplation of the uni­verse in which we dwell presentsit per­petually to our view. Amidst the vast  extent of creation, we discover no in­stance of mere pomp, or useless grandeur, but behold every thing contributing to the general good, and rendered subser­vient to the welfare of the rational or sensible world. In the administration of Providence, the same principle of bene­ficence is conspicuous. The seasons are made regularly to return, and the earth to flourish; supply is bountifully provi­ded for the wants of all creatures; and numberless comforts are prepared to sweet­en human life. Most justly is he who hath established, and who upholds, this admirable order of things, to be esteemed the Father of mercies: and, accordingly, in this view, he is often celebrated in scrip­ture. The earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. His tender mercies are over all his works. His mercy is great unto the heavens; and it endureth for ever."
"It appears worthy of particular obser­vation that there is one light, in which  more frequently than in any other, the goodness of God is presented to us in the sacred writings, namely, the light of com­passion to the distresses of mankind. Most of the situations are mentioned in which men are considered as most forlorn; and in some passage of scripture, God is re­presented as interesting himself, in a pe­culiar manner, for those who are in such situations. Particular emphasis is always laid upon this circumstance, in the gene­ral views which are given of his goodness. He is the Hearer of prayer, unto whom all flesh shall come. But he is describ as listening with particular attention to the cry of the poor; and regarding the prayer of the destitute: He will prepare their heart, and cause his ear to hear. All creatures are the objects of his providen­tial care. But the widow and the father­less, the bowed down and the broken in heart, are particularly attended to, and commi­serated by him. The Lord executeth judgement  for the oppressed; the Lord preserv­eth the stranger; he looseth the prisoner, and giveth food to the hungry. He hath not despised nor abborred the affliction of the afflicted; nor hides he his face from them, but hears when they cry unto him *. In short, when we are deprived of all hu­man consolation and aid, the Almighty is represented as then most accessible to our prayers, and most disposed to help and relieve us."
"The words which I have chosen for the text afford a very amiable view of that compassion which scripture so often ascribes to the Supreme Being. The con­text in which they stand contains much dark and mysterious prophecy relating to nations in the neighbourhood of Ju­dea, but leads to no particular illustration of the text. The words of it, taken by  themselves, are plainly to be understood as spoken by God to an aged parent, who in the view of approaching dissolution, is anxious about the future condition of his family in the world; and they present a most affecting display of God compas­sionate regard to the children of those who have been his faithful servants on earth. Leave thy fatherless children; I will preserve them alive; and let thy wi­dows trust in me. ”It will be worthy of our attention at present, to enquire into the reasons why the Almighty is pleased to represent himself so often to us under this view; not only as the just and good Ruler of the universe, which is the first and leading idea we naturally form of him, but as the Patron and Friend of the distressed part of mankind."
"It will be found that there are two ve­ry important purposes which such disco­veries of the divine nature serve. First, they furnish particular ground for trust  in God, amidst all the vicissitudes of hu­man life; and next, they exhibit the pat­tern of that disposition, which we ought, in our measure, humbly to follow and i­mitate."
"I. THE discoveries of divine compassion were purposely intended to furnish to us particular ground for trust in God, amidst all the vicissitudes of human life. Man, during his abode on earth, is exposed to various distresses. Even in his most flou­rishing state, his condition is extremely precarious. Prosperous as he may at one time seem to be, he cannot tell how soon, by some unforeseen vicissitude, he may be humbled to the dust; and still less can he tell what may in future befal his chil­dren, to whose fortunes he often looks with anxious solicitude. In the moments when his mind is oppressed, either by the immediate feeling of sorrows or by the dread of impending evils, it is natural  for him to fly to that Supreme Being, under whose direction all human events are placed, and earnestly to implore pro­tection, from him. ”But though he hold the belief that justice and goodness are ver to be found at the throne of the Al­mighty, yet, even there, particular dis­couragements meet him. For that Su­preme Being to whom he looks up is a great and an awful Being. His nature is, to us, unknown. He dwells in the secret place of Eternity; and is surrounded with clouds and darkness. We hear his tre­mendous voice in the thunder; and in very commotion of the elements we be­hold the irresistible hand of his power. A nature so infinitely superior to our own cannot be looked up to without some mea­sure of dismay. It is overwhelming to the timid apprehension of the distressed. It is contemplated with that awful and mysterious reverence which overpowers confidence and trust."
" It is for this reason that, in condescen­sion to human weakness, God has been pleased so often to represent himself as ac­tuated by a principle of compassion and pity. This gives a shade and soften to the awful greatness of the Divinity. It brings down his goodness to the level of our conception, and fits it to be the object of our trust. Compassion is a principle which we all feel and know. We know that it is the strongest of all the be­nevolent instincts in our nature, and that it tends directly to interest us in behalf of those who need our aid. We are taught to believe that a similar attribute belongs to the divine nature; in order that, from that species of goodness which we are best acquainted with, and which we can most rely upon, we may be trained both to love our almighty Benefactor, and as long as we are in the practice of our duty, to trust to his protection, amidst every distress.  When we hear such a voice of ten­derness, as that which my text utters, pro­ceeding from the Almighty, our hearts are comforted. Distrust and dismay are re­moved. We are no longer oppressed by his greatness. We can draw near to him as to a Father in heaven, before whom we can, with humble confidence, pour out our sorrows; and can trust that, though all our earthly friends should neglect us, our prayers will attract his compassionate re­gard."
"Compassion, to the unfortunate, as it is exerted among men, is indeed accompa­nied with certain disturbed and painful feelings, arising from sympathy with those whom we pity. But every such feeling we must remove from our thoughts, when we ascribe an affection of this nature to the Deity. It is true, that, in scripture language, the divine compassion is some­times figured by strong allusions to the relenting struggles and passionate meltings  of the human heart. But we easily per­ceive that such representations are to be understood with the allowances which fi­gurative language requires. All that is amiable in compassion belongs to God; but all that is imperfect in it must be left to man. In the Supreme Being there can be no perturbation or uneasiness; no con­trast of feelings, nor fluctuation of pur­pose. His compassion imports a kind re­gard to the circumstances of the unhappy. But still it is such a regard as suits the perfection of the great Governor of the universe; whose benignity, undisturbed by any violent emotion, ever maintains the same tranquil tenor, like the unruffled and uninterrupted serenity of the highest heavens."
"It is important to observe, that this pity and compassion of our heavenly Fa­ther extends itself to our moral and spiri­tual concerns, in like manner as to our natural and external distresses. In that  great dispensation of the redemption of the world by his Son Jesus Christ, he is al­ways represented in scripture as moved by pity for our fallen and wretched estate. The same principle which leads him to regard with compassion the widow and the fatherless, led him to look down with compassion on an helpless and forlorn race, degraded from their original honour. From infinite mercy he sent his Son to seek and to save that which was lost. According to the prophetical language of the Old Testament, He looked upon us; and his time was a time of love. He saw that there was no man; He be­held that there was no intercessor, and his own arm brought salvation. He laid his help on one who was mighty to save. He saw us in our blood, and said, Live ”Agreeable to this spirit of compassion, dis­played in our redemption, is the whole dispensation  of divine grace towards man in his present state of infirmity. It speaks continually the doctrine of consolation and merciful aid; grace to be sufficient for us, and strength to be made perfect in our weakness. As a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him; for he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust *."
"I cannot conclude this head without observing how much it adds to the value of the Christian religion, that it hath dis­covered the Deity to us in a light so amia­ble. When the nations of the earth wor­shipped a God unknown, or one whom they arrayed in nothing but vengeful thunders, the true God hath come forth from behind the cloud, and made him­self known to us; known, not only as a just and good Ruler, but as a compassion­ate Father, in whom, amidst all their distresses,  the virtuous may trust and hope. I now proceed to observe,"
"II. THAT such discoveries of the di­vine nature were designed, not only to minister encouragement and consolation, but also to exhibit the pattern of that dis­position which we are bound, in our mea­sure, to imitate and follow. To this pur­pose tend the repeated exhortations of scripture, to be followers of God, as dear children; to be merciful as our Father in heaven is merciful. That hardness of heart which renders men insensible to the dis­tresses of their brethren, that insolence of prosperity which inspires them with con­tempt of those who are fallen below them, are always represented in scripture as dis­positions most opposite to the nature of God, and most hateful in his sight. In order to make this appear in the strongest light, he hath turned his goodness chiefly into the channel of compassionate regard  to those whom the selfish and the proud despise. He hath avowedly taken up their cause, that he might state himself as an antagonist to such as would bear them down; that he might confound and put to the blush that arrogance of men which makes them slight any of their own bre­thren. For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord, to set them in safety from him that puffeth at them *. Lord, says the Psalmist, thou hast heard the desire of the humble; thou wilt arise to judge the father­less, and the oppressed, that the man of earth may oppress no more   ."
"Consider, I beseech you, whether any virtue can admit of a higher recommenda than its being that disposition under the character of which the Almighty chu­ses to be peculiarly known to us? How can we claim any relation to the Father of  mercies, or how look up to him for com­passion and grace, if we show no bowels of mercy, gentleness, and kindness, to one another? ”The whole plan, indeed, on which he hath formed human nature, and all the circumstances in which he hath placed us on earth, are plainly contrived to excite affections of benevolence, and to enforce works of mercy. Not only hath he planted compassion in the human breast, as one of the strongest instincts there, but he hath so connected us in society, as ne­cessarily to require that our benevolent in­stincts should be brought into exercise. For it is apparent that no man, in any rank of life, even the highest, is sufficient for his own well-being. He can neither supply his own wants, nor provide for his own comforts, without the co-operation of others. The dependence here is mu­tual between the high and the low, the rich and the poor. Each, in one way or other, calls on each for aid. All are so  linked together, as to be impelled by a thousand motives to assist one another in the time of need. This is what nature, what society, what providence, all speak with a loud voice; a voice which may be said to have gone forth even to the ends of the earth, and to have been heard and un­derstood by the most barbarous tribes of men. For among savage and uncultivat nations, no less than among the most civilized and polished, the energy of com­passion is felt, and its claims are recognis and obeyed."
"In the course of human life, innumera­ble occasions present themselves for all the exercises of that humanity and benignity, to which we are so powerfully prompted. The diversities of rank among men, the changes of fortune to which all, in every rank, are liable, the necessities of the poor, the wants of helpless youth, the infirmi­ties of declining age, are always giving op­portunities for the display of humane affections.  There is perhaps no form in which benevolence appears more interest  than when it is employed in providing relief for the families and children of those who stand in need of aid, in order that the young may be trained up by proper edu­cation for acting an useful part in the world. Benefits conveyed by this chan­nel are often more important than any ther acts of liberality. Besides the great advantage which they bring to society, they have the pleasing effect of awakening all the virtuous sensibilities of the heart, both in those who confer, and in those who receive them. They are often felt with a warmer relish by a family in distress, and productive of more tender gratitude, than could have been raised by any other mode of beneficence. This is rendered sensible to every heart by that beautiful ex­pression of the divine compassion in the text; Leave thy fatherless children; I will  preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me."
"BY the train of sentiment we have pur­sued, your thoughts, my brethren, will now be naturally led to the consideration of that institution which has given occa­sion to the meeting of this day; The Society formed for the benefit of the Sons of the Clergy of the Established church of Scotland."
"In entering on this part of the subject, I trust that I may be permitted to say a few words concerning that order of men, in behalf of whose descendents the favour of the public is now requested. Though belonging myself to that order, yet as my advanced age and long experience may reasonably be supposed to have corrected the prejudices and cooled the ardour of partiality, some weight, I hope, will be al­lowed to my testimony; when now, in the fifty-fourth year of my ministry, after hav seen successions of ministers, in various  parts of the country rise and fall, and af­ter long acquaintance with many, of di­vided sentiments, among my brethren, I can with confidence declare it as my opi­nion, that there exists not any where a more respectable and useful class of men than the Clergy of the Church of Scot­land. Among such a numerous body, I readily admit that some exceptions will be found to the character which I now give of them. Considering human frailty, this is no more than was naturally to be expected. But, taking the ministers of this church in general, I can venture to as­sert that they are a well-informed and en­lightened set of men; decent and irre­proachable in their behaviour, conscien­tious in the discharge of their pastoral du­ties, and very generally esteemed by the people under their care. There was a time, when the Presbyterian clergy lay un­der the imputation of being sour in their tempers, narrow in their opinions, severe  and intolerant in their principles. But as, together with the diffusion of know­ledge, a more liberal spirit has pervaded the clerical order in this part of Britain, it will be found that their manners now are conciliating; that they study to pro­mote harmony and good order in their parishes; that they have shown themselves addicted to useful literature, and in several branches of it have eminently distinguish themselves; and that while they are difying and consolatory to the lowest, they have acquired just respect from the higher classes of men."
"As long, therefore, as this country shall be preserved from the contagion of that false philosophy which, by overthrowing all religious establishments, has engender so much impiety, and wrought so much mischief, in a neighbouring land; as long as the existence of Christian faith, and of religious principles, shall be considered as essential to the welfare of a nation, it may  reasonably, I think, be expected, that such a body of men as I have mentioned shall be held entitled to the regard and good will of their fellow citizens and country­men."
"Circumstances there are, which give par­ticular occasion for this regard and good will to be called forth. You all know the nature of that provision which is made by the public for the established clergy of this country. It is such as is suited to that so­ber and frugal manner of living which is expected from ministers of the gospel. Though, in consideration of the growing prosperity of the country, and of its natu­ral consequence, the increased rate of every expence, it has been found reasonable that, of late years, some addition should be made to the provision of many of the mi­nisters, yet still their condition approaches not to what can be termed opulence in any degree. It is such as to raise them a­bove contempt; such as to afford a decent  subsistence for themselves and their fami­milies; but such as seldom or never can enable them, without some other sources of revenue, to make provision for their children when going forth into the world, especially if their family be numerous."
"It was the consideration of this circum­stance that lately gave rise to the Society in favour of the Sons of the Clergy. Ma­ny a minister who, for a tract of years, has faithfully laboured in the discharge of every duty to his flock, has felt, towards the close of his days, what a blessing it would have proved to him, if such a so­ciety had existed in his time, to which he could have looked for aid ”Represent to yourselves, my friends, one of this cha­racter, ”and the representation which I am now to give is not the work of fancy, but founded upon what often in fact takes place. ”Figure, I say, a worthy clergy­man, now in the decline of life, foreseeing the end of his labours drawing near, surrounded  with a family of children, to whom his chief care had been devoted, and and in whom his heart had long been bound up. Their education, from their earliest years, he had conducted, or at least superintended himself, with paternal fond­ness. Whatever his scanty stores could afford he had cheerfully expended, in giv all the advantage to their education which his own village, or which the near­est county town could yield. He had made every preparation that was in his power to make, for their acting a proper part in future life. But the time of pre­paration is finished. The gay season of childhood is over. The period is arrived when they must go forth; must leave that paternal mansion where, in the midst of their youthful companions, they had spent many happy days; must go to provide for themselves, the best they can, in a world which to them is unknown. And whether are they to go? ”Of the few  friends their father ever had, some are now gone gone down to the dust. Others, with whom he once lived in familiar inti­macy, lifted up now with the pride of pulence, have forgotten him and his fa­mily. One of his sons, at least, he fondly wished to have educated for that profession to which he himself had been so long at­tached. But, living at a distance from a­ny of the seats of learning, and having no protector to whose assistance he could look, he feels with regret that he is unable for the attempt. Some of his children he must send away to seek their fortune in a distant land. Others must be consigned to the dangers of the ocean, or be reduced to gain their bread by following some of the mean and laborious occupations of life. Viewing the dark and discouraging pro­spect that is before them, the father heart is sore, when he bids adieu to his children. With tears in his eyes, he gives them his blessing as they depart. Little more it is in  his power to give them; but he commits them to the protection of their Father God. ”How happy, if, in these mourn­ful moments, a voice of such a nature as this could reach his ears; Leave thy fa­therless children; I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me!"
"ANIMATED by the desire of imitating that spirit of divine compassion which breathes in these words, a few respectable gentlemen in this city formed, six years ago, the plan of a Society for assisting the Sons of the Clergy. The institution, as soon as it was known, met with public approbation and favour. It was early distinguished, and amply assisted by Roy­al munificence. It was incorporated by Royal charter; and through the genero­sity of the public, has prospered so far, that the Society has already been enabled to give aid to a considerable number of the sons of clergymen of this church.  The aid which the Society, in an infant state, could as yet give, has been small; as it is confined to what the interest of their capital allows them to bestow. They ear­nestly wish to become more effectually useful, by enlarging their provi [...]ion for the education of Sons; and hope to be ena­bled, in due time, to give assistance to the Daughters as well as to the Sons of mini­sters; so as to afford comfort to a widowed mother, and to the whole of a disconsolate family. For, it is to be observed, that it is not merely to a literary education, or to preparation for the church, that the in­tentions of the Society are directed. They mean so to apply their beneficence, that the families of ministers may be assisted to ac­quire the necessary qualifications for pur­suing any useful employment in the world, for which they appear to be most fitted."
"Among other inducements which may encourage the public to promote this bene­ficent plan, there is one which I cannot, on  this occasion, omit to mention; that is, the signal success with which many sons of Scots clergymen have been blessed, in fill with honour several of the important departments of Society. As I have not myself the honour of belonging to that class, I can speak with more freedom on this topic than some other of my brethren. Not to mention the well known and dis­tinguished names of several who at pre­sent possess, with much dignity, stations in the church, and chairs in the universi­ties, and some, now gone, who will be long remembered as having done no small ho­nour, by their literary productions, to this part of the island; let me desire you to look round on the most respectable stations of busy life, and to consider how many of those who now make a high figure at the bar, some on the bench, many in the commer­cial, the military, and the naval professions, were born and bred under the humble roof of a minister. ”Nor is this success  to be ascribed to any favourable coinci­dence of circumstances at this time more than any other. It is the natural result of the manner in which they were brought up. Educated in good principles, and formed to sober manners, by pious and vir­tuous parents, they enter on the world less tainted than others by fashionable vices and follies. By the situation of their pa­rents they were inured, from their earliest youth, to temperance and habits of appli­cation. They come forward, not altoge­ther ignorant and unlettered, like the chil­dren of the meaner classes of men, but with the foundations of good education and useful knowledge. At the same time, they see and know that it is not to fortune and to friends, but to their own industry and exertions, they must trust for future success; and that only according to the opinion entertained of their merit, they can hope to be patronized by others. Hence it comes to pass that young persons  of this description often advance them­selves more quickly, and act their part more successfully than others who, from their birth and fortune, have enjoyed the benefits of a more improved and orna­mented education; but whose opulence sometimes supersedes labour, encourages indolence, and perhaps fosters dissipation and love of pleasure."
"These are considerations which tend to bespeak public favour in behalf of the in­stitution which I now recommend. Con­sider, my friends, that by befriending and assisting it, you contribute to bring for­ward a new race, who, like those of the same rank that have gone before them, may come, in their day, to be beneficial to their country and to the world. It must not be forgotten, that assistance to bring them forward becomes now more neces­sary than it was to the former race, in consequence of the great additional ex­pence which is well known now to attend  every part of education. By seasonable generosity, on this occasion, you may be ripening in secret the seeds of future ge­nius; you may be bringing forward to maturity those young plants which shall flourish hereafter in the land; and which may perhaps attain such strength, and rise to such a height, as to protect others under their shade."
"To the honour of the present age, it must be acknowledged not to be deficient in a spirit of humanity. Frequent instan­ces both of public and private beneficence come forth on every proper occasion. In this city, many a noble monument appears of charitable foundations and institutions; some destined to educate the children of the needy; others to furnish maintenance for the poor, to provide for the aged, or to receive and relieve the sick and the dis­tressed. By their means much timely succour is given, and many a distress is mi­tigated. The institution for the sake of  which we are now assembled, partaking of the same benevolent spirit with the others, reaches to a more respectable class of men, and aims at a more extensive object. Its purpose is, to prevent those evils which would arise to the public, from the children of worthy parents being left to languish in that hopeless indigence which throws them first as a burden on society, and may afterwards render them a dangerous nu­sance to it. Instead of this, it aims at bringing them into such a state as affords a reasonable prospect of their proving use­ful members of the community, and per­haps of their ranking among its ornaments and supports."
"So good a design Providence has alrea­dy begun to favour, and we hope will continue to bless. After we are laid in the dust, the generation that succeeds us may experience its happy effects. They who now contribute by their generosity to carry it forward will, in the mean time,  enjoy the satisfaction of having adopted the benevolent spirit of the Christian reli­gion. They will enjoy the satisfaction of having imitated, as they could, that com­passion of our heavenly Father which, in so affecting a manner, is expressed by the words of the text; words, which I hope will continue to dwell, with a lasting and tender impression, on all our hearts; Leave thy fatherless children; I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows trust in me!"
"FINIS."
"The Importance of RELIGIOUS KNOW­LEDGE to the Happiness of Mankind. A SERMON PREACHED BEFORE The SOCIETY for propagating CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE: At their Anniversary Meeting IN The HIGH CHURCH of Edinburgh, ON Monday, January 1. 1750. And published at their DESIRE."
"By HUGH BLAIR A  One of the Ministers of Canongate."
"EDINBURGH, Printed by  FLEMING, for A. KINCAID, DCC "
"A SERMON PREACHED IN The HIGH-CHURCH of Edinburgh, BEFORE The SOCIETY for propagating CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE."
"ISAIAH xi. 9. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Mountain: For the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea."
"THIS Passage of Scripture is understood, by all Christian Interpreters, to refer to the Days of the Gospel. The Prophet is describing in the Context the Influence of the Messiah Reign, extending through  all Nature, and producing universal Happiness. This, in its full Accomplishment, doubtless, is yet fu­ture, and respects some more advanced Period  of the Kingdom of God, foretold in other Pas­sages of the prophetick Writings; when true Religion shall universally prevail, and the na­tive Tendency of the Gospel attain its entire Effect. In the Prospect of this, the Prophet seems to rise above himself, and celebrates those happy Days in the most sublime, figurative Strain of Eastern Poetry. He opens a beau­tiful View of the State of the World, as a State of returning Innocence. He represents all Na­ture flourishing in Peace; Discord and Guile abolished; the most hostile Natures reconciled, and the most savage tamed and reformed. The Wolf also shall dwell with the Lamb; and the Leopard shall ly down with the Kid: And the Calf and the young Lion, and the Fatling toge­ther, and a little Child shall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear shall feed, their young Ones shall ly down together; and the Lion shall eat Straw like the Ox; and the sucking Child shall play on the Hole of the Asp, and the weaned Child shall put his Hand on the Cockatrice Den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy Moun­tain: For (assigning in the Text the Cause of this great and happy Revolution) the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Wa­ters cover the Sea."
" UPON reading these Words, we must imme­diately perceive the great Encouragement they give to all good Designs, for promoting Reli­gion in the World. When we engage in this Cause, we have the Comfort, not only of be engaged in a good Cause, but also in one that will undoubtedly be successful. For we are here assured, by the Divine Promise, that Truth and Goodness shall at length prevail, and the increasing Light and Influence of Religion prove the Cause of general Order and Happiness. It is a noble and animating Thought, that, in such Designs, we co-ope­rate with God for advancing the Kingdom of the Messiah, and work upon his Plan with all the Force of eternal Providence on our Side. Nor ought we to be discouraged by those un­favourable Circumstances, which at present seem to make against us. though  the Ignorance, Superstition and Corruption that now fill so much of the World, have a dark and mysterious Aspect, it is not beyond the Power of that su­preme Being, who brings Light out of Dark­ness, to unravel all those perplexed Appearan­ces, and gradually to extricate Mankind from the Labyrinth of Vice and Error. From the  present State of the World, it is not more un­likely, that the Gospel shall one Day be univer­sally received, and exert its entire Influence on the Hearts of Men; than once it was, that it should reach so far, and demolish so much stablished Superstition as it has already done. At the Rise of Christianity, there was as great a Disproportion between the apparent human Causes, and the Effect which has been actually produced, as there is, in our Times, between the Circumstances of Religion in the World, and the Effect which we farther expect. The Sun of Righteousness having exerted its Influence so far, in breaking through  the thickest Darkness, we may justly hope, that it is powerful enough to dispel all remaining Obscurity, and that it will ascend by Degrees to that perfect Day, when Healing shall be under its Wings to all the Nations. A little One shall become a Thousand, and a small One a strong Nation: I the Lord will hasten it in its Time *."
"BESIDES this Encouragement to our Endea­vours for advancing Religion, there is to be observed in the Text, a precise Connection mark  between the Increase of religious Knowledge and the Happiness of Mankind. The Know­ledge of the Lord filling the Earth, is distinctly assigned as the Cause, why they shall not hurt nor destroy in all God holy Mountain. To this I am principally to lead your Thoughts; as a Sub­ject properly suited to the Occasion of our Meet  and peculiarly necessary, as I conceive, to be inculcated, in the present Times, which seem to be waxing indifferent, more and more, to all religious Principles. Whether Christianity shall be propagated further or not, is treated as a Matter of no great Concern to Mankind. pinions prevail, that moral Virtue may subsist, with equal Advantage, independent of Religi­on. For moral Principles great Regard is pre­tended: But Articles of religious Belief are thought abstract Things; remote from Life; Points of mere Speculation and Debate; of very inconsiderable Influence on the Actions of Men. The general Conduct of Mankind, it is argued, will always proceed upon Principles and Views of another Nature; and therefore, religious Knowledge stands in no necessary Connection with their Improvement or Hap­piness. Fact and Experience is alledged for  this. Even amongst many, who would not be ranged on the Side of Unbelief, this loose and indifferent Spirit too much prevails; and hence, the Profession of Religion amongst us is too visibly sinking into Disrepute. How adverse all this is to the Design which the present Dis­course is intended to recommend, needs not be said. How adverse it is to the general Welfare and most real Interests of Mankind, I hope, shall be made evident to candid Minds."
"BY the Knowledge of the Lord, is not to be understood the natural Knowledge of God only. It is plain, the Prophet speaks of those Times of the Messiah, when more enlarged Discoveries should be made to Mankind of the Divine Per­fections, and of the Measures of the Divine ministration, than mere unassisted Reason could reach. Our natural Notices of God and Re­ligion are not laid aside by Christianity, but cleared from Error, confirmed by higher Evi­dence, and carried into a wider Field. In this enlarged Sense of religious Knowledge, to make its Importance to the Happiness of Mankind appear, let us consider Man,"
"    I. As an Individual,"
"    AND  As a Member of Society."
"I. CONSIDERING Man, in his single Capa­city, as an Individual, our Inquiry shall here begin, of what Importance it is to him to have just and true Principles of religious Belief. This divides itself unto two grand Branches: With respect, first, to his Improvement; and next, to his Consolation."
"1. As to the real Improvement of Man; the Advancement of his Nature in what is morally valuable and useful; the Acquisition of such Dispositions and Habits, as fit him for acting his Part well on this Stage, and prepare him for a higher State of Life and Action hereaf­ter: What Benefit does he receive, in these Respects, from religious Knowledge and Belief? It must be obvious, that all Increase of Know­ledge is Improvement to the Understanding. The further its Sphere extends, the more Ob­jects that are submitted to its View and Con­templation, especially when those Objects are of intrinsick Excellence, the more that under­standing Power, which is the Glory of Man,  is in the Course of attaining its proper Strength and Maturity. Hence Truth is justly said to be the Food of the Soul. But were the Knowledge of Religion merely speculative, though  the Specu­lation must be allowed to be noble, yet less could be said of its Importance. We recom­mend it to Mankind, as forming their Hearts. Pure and exalted Conceptions of the Deity, such as Religion gives us; ”The universal Fa­ther and righteous Governor of the Universe; ”the Author of every good and perfect Gift; him­self the Standard of unspotted Perfection and Goodness; ”conducting his whole Administra with an eternal Regard to Order, Virtue and Truth; ”ever favouring the Cause, and supporting the Interests of Righteousness, and righteous Men; ”and applying to this the whole Force of Omnipotence, and the whole Art of unerring Wisdom, from the Beginning to the End of Things: ”Such Conceptions of the Dei­ty naturally descend into the Heart; kindle in it the Love of Goodness, and establish a Persua­sion of its being our highest Interest. They give a peculiar Strength and Fortitude to the Mind in the Practice of Virtue; and they pro­mote a chearful Acquiescence in this supremely  wise and righteous Administration, whatever Trials and Sufferings may arise."
"ALL the Doctrines peculiar to Christian Re­velation are great Improvements of what the Light of Nature imperfectly suggests. A Dis­pensation of Providence is made known to us, particularly suited to the Exigencies of Man: Calculated for recovering him from that cor­rupt and guilty State, into which, Experience bears Witness that he is fallen, and restoring him to a State of Integrity and Favour with his Creator. The Method of carrying on this great Plan is such as gives us the most affecting Views of the Importance of Holiness and Good­ness, and of the high Account in which it stands with God. The Son of God appearing on the Earth, and dying as a Propitiation for the Sins of the World, that he might bring in everlasting Righteousness *; that he might purge our Con­sciences from dead Works, to serve the living God   ; that he might redeem us from all Ini­quity, and purify unto himself a peculiar People, zealous of good Works  –. Such a gracious and merciful Interposition of the Creator of the  World, so distinguishing a Proof of his Con­cern for the moral Interests of Mankind, is most proper to warm the Heart with Devoti­on; and adds to the Cause of Goodness the Force of every Motive from Gratitude and in­genuous Affection. These Discoveries of the Gospel have this further Effect, to establish an unshaken Confidence in God. They afford something to the Mind, on which it can lay hold as the Security of its Hope; when, with a Certainty far beyond that of mere abstract Argument, it appeals to Matter of Fact; and is taught to say, He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all Things *? Hence the great Encouragement to the Repentance and Reformation of Sinners, from the Hope of Acceptance with God through  JESUS CHRIST, and from the Belief of a Divine Assistance communicated to the Upright in Heart. Whilst the Government of God is thus rendered most amiable, placed in a Light most encouraging to every virtuous Mind; there is, at the same Time, something extremely awful and solemn in the whole Doctrine of the Redemption. It  naturally strikes the Mind with Reverence for the Divine Law; pointing at some deep Malig­nity in Sin, some dreadful Consequences flow from it, unknown perhaps in their Causes, and in their whole Extent, to the human Mind, which moved the Creator of the World to part from the ordinary Laws of Providence, and to undertake the Restoration of guilty Crea­tures, by a Method so astonishing. Hence, Mankind are awakened to serious Reflection. Hence, such Views arise of the Laws under which they are placed, and of the Ends of Be they are bound to fulfil, as give Solemnity to Virtue, and restrain them from trifling with Life: Especially, when to this is joined the Dis­covery of Life and Immortality by the Gospel; the Connection in which this Life stands with a future eternal State, for which we are now under Probation; in a Course of Discipline; which, according as by Divine Assistance it terminates in our Improvement in Virtue, or, through  our own Misconduct, leaves us in a cor­rupt unimproved State, will dismiss us to lasting Abodes either of Punishment or Reward. This is far above those faint interrupted Hopes, those feeble ineffectual Reasonings, which mere na­tural  Light suggests, concerning the future Con­dition of Mankind. Here we find, what alone can be of any considerable Weight with Men in Practice, ”direct Promise and Threatning, ”an authoritative Sanction given to a Law, ”the Governor revealed, ”and the Motives addressed to Hope and Fear, urged home on the Mind by, Thus saith the Lord of Hosts. Nor are Cir­cumstances wanting to impress the Imagination in the liveliest Manner. The Resurrection of the Body, the Solemnity of a future Judgment, the decisive Sentence, the final Separation, and the everlasting Mansions of the Good and the Bad, are all set forth in strong and affecting Co­lours. In short, a great and magnificent Plan of Divine Administration is in Part opened; and nothing is omitted that may give Mankind the deepest Sense of their being all the Subjects of the moral Government of God."
"THE Bounds of this Discourse have allowed me to give but an imperfect View of the great Principles of Religion. From these Hints, how­ever, we may recollect so much of the Christi­an Doctrine, as will be a sufficient Foundation for an Appeal to every impartial Mind, whether  the Knowledge, the real and firm Belief of these Principles of Religion, be not strictly connected with the Improvement of Man; and thereby of the highest Importance to his Happiness. I rea­son now with those who admit, that to be vir­tuous and good is real Improvement and Hap­piness. Let them lay what Stress they will upon Conscience, upon its natural Authority within, and the Force and Evidence of its Dic­tates: Obstinate sure they must be, who will not grant, that the natural Tendency of these religious Principles is to support the Dictates, and confirm the Authority of Conscience; to awaken, on various Occasions, the most useful Feelings; to provide additional Restraints from Vice, and additional Motives to every Virtue. Who dares say, that there is no Case in which Conscience stands in real Need of such Assist­ance, to direct, where there is so much Uncer­tainty and Darkness; and to prompt, where there is so much Feebleness and Irresolution, and such a fatal Proneness to Vice and Folly?"
"BUT how good soever the Tendency of reli­gious Principles may be, their actual Significan­cy and Influence on Life will still be called in  Question. This Tendency is by various Causes defeated: between the Belief of religious Prin­ciples, and correspondent Practice, it will be said, that Experience shows there is no neces­sary Connection; nor can the Propagation of the one at all assure us, that proportionable Im­provements will follow in the other. ”This is in Part allowed: As we allow, that Knowledge and Belief admit of various Degrees, before they arrive at that Christian Faith, which the Scrip­ture represents as certainly purifying the Heart. But, though  the Connection be not necessary be­twixt Knowledge and Practice, I hope it will not be denied, that some Connection there is. Here there is one Avenue to the Heart. If the Tendency of religious Knowledge be good, Wisdom must direct, and Duty oblige us to cul­tivate it. For Tendency will, at least in some Cases, become effectual; in more Cases, proba­bly, than are taken notice of amidst the Hurry of the World. Besides the known and distin­guished Examples of true Religion and Virtue, which, in every Age of Christianity, have shone, more or less, as Lights of the World: How ma­ny may there be, in the more silent Scenes of Life, overlooked by superficial Observers of  Mankind, on whose Hearts and Lives religious Principles have a great and happy Influence? Even on loose and giddy Minds, where they are far from operating their full Effect, their Influence is not altogether lost. Religious Prin­ciples are at least a Clog on Vice in its Career; they stop it from going its full Length; and, though  they do not entirely reform the Mind, are however the Means of preserving external Or­der, and giving a Check to open Profligateness and Dissolution of Manners. Men, that are now bad, might probably have been worse without them; and the World have suffered more from their Licentiousness. Besides, they often sow latent Seeds of Goodness in the Heart, which proper Circumstances and Occa­sions ripen; when the Reformation of the Of­fender, perhaps, is not so conspicuous to the World, as his former bad Manners have been. From the native Tendency of religious Know­ledge there is Reason to believe, that those good Effects of it are not so rare, as some would persuade us; especially, when we consider it as accompanied with a Divine Blessing. By the Nature and plain Tendency of a Thing, it is more reasonable to judge of it, than to lay the  whole Stress on Observations drawn from a sup­posed Experience, which often is narrow in its Compass, and fallacious in its Conclusions. One great Cause of the Tendency of Religion being often defeated, certainly is, that the Knowledge of Divine Things is not thoroughly imbibed, nor the Belief of them fully received. Were a just Sense and a firm Persuasion of them more general amongst Men, we may rationally hope their good Effects would more extensively appear."
"I ADMIT indeed, that mere Knowledge will prove unavailing against the Power of Temper and settled Habits: These,  it is said, govern the Life of Men far more than religious Belief, and will be too hard for all Principles whatever. Perhaps this is said with Truth. But then we ought to consider, that it is the Nature of Re­ligion to work itself gradually into the Affecti­ons, to acquire the Dominion of the Temper, and so to give Rise to Habits of acting. Hence the Perfection of religious Influence is, with great Justice and Propriety, described in Scrip­ture, by a new Heart and a new Spirit; when the Mind is not involuntarily constrained by  Principle, but Principle forms the inward Con­stitution, and becomes, in a Manner, the same with Temper and Affection."
"BUT the actual Influence of Principle and Belief on Mankind admits of further Illustra  from uncontested Matter of Fact. They who hold the good Influence of Christian Prin­ciples to be so inconsiderable, as to render the Propagation of them of no great Importance, will be at no Loss to give us Instances of cor­rupt and wrong Principles having had a great Influence on the World. Loud Complaints we hear from this Quarter, of the direful Ef­fects which Superstition and Enthusiasm have produced; how they have poisoned the Tempers, and transformed the Manners of Men; and have overcome the strongest Restraints of Law, of Reason and Humanity. ”Is this then the Case, that all Principles, except good ones, are supposed to be of such mighty Energy? Strange! that false Religion should do so much, and true Religion so little. ”No impartial Inquirer, sure, can be of such an absurd Opinion. The whole History of Mankind shows, that religi­ous Belief is no inconsiderable Principle of  Action. The Mischief such Belief has done, when misled, is indeed a good Argument to be on our Guard against Error: But, as it is a Proof of what Belief can do, it is an Argument to hope the more from it, when rightly direct  The same Torrent that overflows and lays waste a Country, when put out of its natural Course, enriches the Soil, when it runs in its proper Bed. If it be alledged, that Superstition is the more powerful Principle, by falling in with the weak and corrupt Propensities of Mankind; it may be opposed to this, that Truth has the Divine Blessing, and the Coun­tenance of Heaven, on its Side. Let us always hope well of a Cause that is good in itself, and beneficial to Mankind. Truth is mighty, and will prevail. Let us spread the incorruptible Seed as widely as we can, and trust in God, that he will give the Increase. So much for the Im­portance of religious Knowledge to every In­dividual, in the Way of Improvement. Let us next consider,"
"2. WHAT it promises in the Way of Con­solation, of Aid and Relief to Man, amidst the Distresses of Life. Here it must be allowed by  all, that Religion triumphs; and its valuable Influence in this Respect, must be a strong Argument to every benevolent Mind, for wish that Influence to be further spread through  the World. For, without religious Principle and Hope, Man is a Creature miserable and forlorn. He finds himself here a Stranger in a wide World, where the Powers and Operations of Nature are very imperfectly known; where both the Causes and the Issues of Things are wrapt up in much Darkness; where he is quite at a Loss, or at best can form only an uncer­tain Guess, whence he comes; for what Pur­pose he was brought unto this State of Being; and whither he is to go, when he departs from hence. What a disconsolate Situation is this to a serious inquiring Mind! Even though  it were in a Man Power to fill up the Hours of Life with perpetual Amusement, void of Care; Life, enjoyed on such Terms, would, upon Reflec  appear poor and trifling: But how much worse, when we consider the real Condition of Man; a Being frail and feeble, beset with vari­ous Dangers and Ills, and exposed to many a melancholy Reflection, when he sees all Things around him so transitory and decaying, and  meets with Disappointment and Sorrow, with Vanity and Vexation, in all the Paths of Life! In this distressed Condition, to reveal to him such Discoveries of God, and his Administra  as the Christian Religion affords, is to re­veal to him a Father and a Friend; is to let in a Ray of most comforting Light upon the Darkness of human Estate. He who was be­fore a destitute Orphan, wandering in the in­hospitable Desart, has now gained a Shelter from the bitter and inclement Blast. He now knows to whom to pray, and in whom to trust; where to unbosom his Sorrows; from what Hand to look for Relief. Certain it is, that when the Heart bleeds, from some Wound of recent Misfortune, there is nothing of equal Efficacy with religious Comfort. It is of Power to chear the darkest Hours, and to asswage the deepest Woe, by the Belief of Divine Favour, and the Prospect of happy Immortality. Here the Mind expatiates with Joy; and, when be­reaved of all its earthly Friends, solaces itself with the Thoughts of One Friend that will never forsake it. These Views have a greater and better Effect on the Heart of a plain, but sin­cere Christian, than all the Refinements of Phi­losophy  have on the Learned. Refined Reason­ings may please and amuse the Mind when it is at Ease; may, perhaps, help to relieve it, when slightly touched with Sorrow; but when it is torn with any sore Distress, they are cold and feeble, compared with a direct Promise from the Word of God. This is an Anchor to the Soul both sure and stedfast. This has given Refuge and strong Consolation to many a pious and virtuous Soul, at a Time when mere Reasonings would have proved utterly unavailing. Besides, that they can never be so accommodated to the Bulk of Mankind, as to be generally useful; this great Disadvantage attends them, that they raise more Perplexities in an inquiring Mind than it is in their Power to resolve. Upon the Approach of Death, especially, this will be felt; when, if a Man thinks at all, his Anxiety must naturally increase about the future Concerns of his Soul. Then it is, that the great Importance of the Discoveries of the Gospel will appear: Not only Life and Immortality brought to Light, but the Path opened that leads to Life: A Me­diator discovered: Mercy proclaimed by the Go­vernor of the World, through  this Mediator, to the Frailties and Errors of those who are peni­tent,  humble and sincere in Heart; and the Presence of their Redeemer promised to con­duct them through  the Valley of the Shadow of Death, to unseen Habitations of Rest and Glory, where he hath prepared their Place. Here is Ground for good Men leaving the World with Comfort and Peace. But in this severe and trying Period, this labouring Hour of Nature, how shall the wretched Man sup­port himself, who believes not, or knows not the Hope of Religion? ”Secretly conscious to himself, that he has not acted the Part he ought, the Failings and Vices of his past Life arise be­fore him in sad Remembrance. He wishes to exist after Death; and yet is afraid of that Ex­istence. The Governor of the World is un­known. His Mercy, for any thing that he can tell, may be implored in vain; all is mysterious Obscurity: And in the midst of endless Per­plexities and Doubts, the trembling Soul is for­ced away from the Body. ”As the Misfortunes of Life must have been insupportable to such a Man, so its End is bitter. His setting Sun goes down in a dark Cloud; and the Night of Death closes over his Head, full of Misery. Having no Hope, and being without God, that  is, without the Knowledge of God in the World, are two Things most justly connected by the Apostle, when he is describing the Misery of the Heathen Nations*. Thus, by Means of the Knowledge of the Lord, Man, considered as an Individual, is both improved and comforted. We are next to show,"
"II. WHAT Benefit he receives from this Knowledge, as a Member of Society. This Branch of the Subject is in Part anticipated, by what has been already said. For all the Im­provement that Man, as an Individual, receives from religious Knowledge, redounds to the Be­nefit of the Publick. Society reaps the Fruits of the Virtue of all its Members; and as each, apart, is made better, the whole must propor­tionably flourish. But, besides this, religious Knowledge has a direct Tendency to improve the social Intercourses of Men, and to assist them in co-operating for common Good."
"FOR, first of all, it forms them for Society. It civilizes Mankind. It tames the Fierceness of their Passions, and wears off the Barbarity of their Manners. Without some Notions of Re­ligion,  it is much to be questioned, whether any regular Society ever subsisted, or could subsist, in the World. All those who, in early Times, attempted to reduce wandering and scattered Men unto Society, found it necessary to begin with some Institution of Religion: And the wisest Legislators of old, through  the whole Pro­gress of their Systems of Government, treated it as necessary and essential to Civil Polity. If even those imperfect Forms of Religion, mixed with so much Error, were important to Socie­ty; how much more, that reasonable and true Worship of God which the Gospel teaches? True Religion introduces the Idea of regular Subjection, by accustoming Mankind to the Awe of superior Power, in the Deity, joined with the Esteem of superior Wisdom and Good­ness. It is, by its Natnre, an associating Prin­ciple, creating new and sacred Bonds of Union amongst Men. Common Assemblies for reli­gious Worship, and the joint Veneration of one God; the Sense of being all, in common, dependent on the same supreme Protection, and bound by the same Ties to Duty, Sharers of the same Benefits of Religion, and Expec­tants of the same Reward; all this has a Ten­dency  to awaken the Sense of our friendly Re­lation, to knit us together, and strengthen our mutual Connection."
"FURTHER, religious Knowledge assists in preparing the Way for all useful and ornamen­tal Improvements in Society. It has, in Fact, been found, that, along with the Increase of religious Light, Learning has flourished, and useful Arts have been cultivated and advanced. The true Knowledge of the Lord promotes a free and manly Spirit. It teaches Men to think for themselves, to form their Principles upon a a fair Inquiry unto the Word of God; and not to resign their Consciences implicitely to Men. Hence, it is strongly connected with a Detesta of Oppression of every kind; and forms a Taste for Liberty and Laws. We see that ty­rannical Governments have taken the firmest Root, in Nations blinded by Mahometan and Pagan Darkness, where the Throne of Vio­lence is supported by Ignorance and Error. In the Christian World, as long as Popish Supersti reigned undisturbed, Darkness, Oppression and Slavery were in its Train. For some Cen­turies, the Cloud sat thick and deep over all Eu­rope,  and threatned a Relapse unto ancient Bar­barity: Till, at the auspicious Aera of the Refor­mation, together with the true Knowledge of the Lord, Learning, Liberty and Arts, began to shine forth, and resume their Lustre. At this Day, the Protestant Religion is, in our own, and some other States, the great Bulwark of Liberty. The Promoters of arbitrary Power know this well; and hence, it has been their constant Aim to bear it down; and in place of the Knowledge of the Lord, to establish an im­plicit Submission to the Dictates of Men, in Matters of Religion."
"BUT this is not the whole of that happy In­fluence which religious Knowledge hath on Society. It is not only subsidiary to its Im­provement, but necessary to its Preservation. It is the very Basis on which it rests. For re­ligious Principle is what gives Mankind the surest Hold of one another. That last and greatest Pledge of Veracity, an Oath, without which no Society can subsist, derives its whole Authority from the Reverence of God, to whom it is a solemn Appeal. Banish religious Principle, and you loosen all the Bonds of So­ciety:  You shake the fundamental Pillar of all mutual Trust and Confidence amongst Men; nay, you destroy the Security arising from Laws themselves. For human Laws and hu­man Sanctions cannot extend to numberless Cases, in which the Safety of Mankind is high­ly concerned. They would be very ineffectual Means of maintaining the Order and Peace of Society, if there were no Checks upon Men, from the Sense of Divine Legislation; if no Be­lief of Divine Rewards and Punishments were to come in Aid, of what human Rewards and Punishments so imperfectly provide for."
"INDEED, the Belief of Religion is of such Importance to publick Welfare, that the most expressive Description we could give of a Soci­ety, in the utmost Circumstances of Disorder, would be to say, There was no Fear of God left amongst them. ”Our Imagination would immediately conceive of them as loose and law­less; abandoned to Rapine and Violence, to Perfidy and Treachery; deceiving and deceived; oppressing and opprest; consumed by intestine Broils, and ripe for becoming a Prey to the first Invader. ”On the other hand, in order to any  Society flourishing in its highest Perfection and Glory, we need only suppose the Belief of Christian Principles prevailing in such a gree, as to exert their entire Influence on the Hearts and Lives of all its Members. Then would the most amiable Scene open. We would see the Causes of publick Disunion instantly re­moved, when Men were once formed to the Pursuit of those higher Interests, which give no Occasion to Competitions and Jealousies; and warmed in Heart with that noble Spirit of Love which our holy Religion breathes; and of which it hath set before us such illustrious Ex­amples in Almighty God, and our blessed Re­deemer. We would see the Principles of Chri­stian Faith shedding over Families, Neighbour­hoods and Communities; the comfortable In­fluences of Unity and Peace, like the Dew of Hermon, and the Dew that descendeth upon the Mountains of Zion, where the Lord commandeth the Blessing, even Life for evermore *. We would see them inspiring private Faith and pub­lick Loyalty; restoring Sobriety of Manners and Simplicity of Life; promoting in every Man Contentment with his Lot, Resignation  to Divine Appointment, continual Regard to the Blessing of Heaven. ”We may extol Riches and Traffick; but, in Truth, the Prevalency of such Principles of publick Virtue and Con­cord, forms the real Strength and Glory of a Nation. In Proportion as these prevail, they give us the Prospect of human Society rising from that sad Degeneracy into which it is at present sunk, and advancing, under the Bles­sing of Heaven, towards that happy Period, when Nation shall not lift up their Sword against Nation, nor War be learned any more *; when there shall be nothing to hurt nor destroy in all the holy Mountain of God."
"To convince us yet further of the Impor­tance of religious Knowledge to the Welfare of Society, there is one Consideration which deserves particular Attention. It is this; That if good Seed be not sown in the Field, Tares will infallibly arise. There is a strong Propen­sion in human Nature to Religion: A natural Preparation of the Mind for receiving some Impressions of religious Belief. In ignorant and uncultivated Minds, Superstition or Enthu­siasm  never fail to graft themselves upon this Root. Into what monstrous Forms these have shot forth, and what various Mischiefs they have produced in Society, is too well known. But this is not the whole of the Danger. For designing Men are seldom wanting to take vantage of popular Weakness; and to improve a superstitious Biass to their own ambitious and interested Ends. Hence Superstition, in itself a formidable Evil, threatens Consequences still more formidable, when it is made the Tool of Ambition and Interest. In this Way Popery has become the Means of enslaving the People, and exalting the Church to exorbitant Power; and, like some baneful Planet, has shed most malignant Influences both on the civil and re­ligious Interests of Christian Society."
"As it is the Ignorance of true Religion which gives Rise to those Evils, this furnishes us with one strong Argument, for promoting the Know­ledge of it in the World; that just and rational Principles of Religion may fill up the Room in Mens Minds, which Superstition will otherwise usurp; and the Enemies of Society will make their Advantage of. This brings the Case near­er  to ourselves, by suggesting to us the Condi of that Part of our own Country, upon which the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have chiefly bestowed their Care. A Part of the Country, which may be consi­dered as yet rude and uncivilized; where Society has scarcely got beyond its Infant State; and whither the Influence of Government and Or­der has very imperfectly reached: Where the Inhabitants, hitherto accustomed to no Subjec  except a slavish Dependence on their Chief­tains, are inured to Rapine, totally negligent of the Arts of Peace, and Strangers to cultivated Life: Where the grossest Ignorance and Su­perstition have remarkably reigned, and have nourished, as their proper Offspring, a blind At­tachment to some pernicious Notions of Go­vernment, artfully instilled into their Minds. If ever the Aid of religious Knowledge was ne­cessary to establish and assist Society, it must be allowed to be necessary here: Especially, as we know Popish Emissaries have not been want among them, to sow their poisonous Prin­ciples; and to foment that disaffected Spirit, the violent Effects of which were felt a few Years ago; when we saw them rushing, like a Torrent  from their own bleak Mountains, to spread Confusion and Terror through a peaceful Land. ”If so many of our Countrymen have hitherto been not only useless, but even danger­ous to the rest of the Society, ought not all wise and good Men to encourage the Design of pro­pagating among them those Principles of true religious Knowledge, which may reform them from Barbarity, and unite them to the rest of the Society? Regard to our own Safety and Tranquility might alone recommend this sign, though  no higher Motive were applied to. The Method, that is employed in carrying it on, must be allowed to be incontestably proper; the Establishment of Schools for the religious Education of Youth, who must otherwise have been void of all moral Culture, and of Course have been the prepared Instruments of Vio­lence and Cruelty. The good Designs of the Legislature for introducing regular Govern­ment, Industry and Arts, into those Parts of the Country, can never be pursued with Success, if Endeavours be not early used, to root out bad Principles, both of Religion and Government, from their Minds, and to plant right ones in their stead. The more directly to co-operate  with the Legislature for civil Good, the Society have not confined themselves to the Care of religious Education; but make it their Endea­vour to banish Idleness, and to instruct Youth in such Arts as may qualify them to be useful Members of Civil Society  ."
"THESE Considerations directly respect the Good of Society. But, when we take the Ar­gument that has been treated, in its full Extent; when we consider the Importance of religious Knowledge, to the Improvement and the Conso­lation of every Individual, to their present Happi­ness, and their Preparation for future Glory, the Motive for spreading that Knowledge through the World receives a great Addition of Strength. Is it not an affecting Thought, that there should be so many of our Fellow-creatures, nay of our Countrymen, destitute of all those Bless­ings which Man may receive from the Disco­veries of the Gospel; Strangers from the Cove­nant of Promise, having no Hope, and without  God in the World *? What a melancholy View does it give us of human Nature, to think of so many dark Places of the Earth that are full of the Habitations of Cruelty; where, either sunk in total Darkness, or enslaved to wild Super­stition, Mankind pass their wretched Days, scarcely raised a Degree above the Beasts that perish! It is noble and generous, to engage in a Design for retrieving Mankind from so much Misery; for advancing at once their temporal and eternal Interests; for bringing so many Souls into the Way of Life, and acquainting them with Him, whom to know is Life eternal   . Such a Design calls upon every Lover of Mankind for Encouragement and Support. As it was un­dertaken from pious and benevolent Views, by the Society erected for this Purpose amongst ourselves, so, by the Progress they have made, we have great Reason to believe it has been car­ried on with Fidelity and Zeal  ¡. Their Con­cern for the Advancement of Religion has not been confined to our native Country. They have sent Missionaries among the Heathen Indians  in our American Colonies, not without Success. In an Undertaking of this Nature, where the Field is so wide, and where so much yet remains to be done, the charitable Assistance of all is most necessary. Those especially who are rich in this World have here an Opportunity put into their Hands by Providence of employing, to the best Advantage, some of that Wealth which they may well spare from the Pomp and Superfluities of Life. This will be laying up in Store for themselves a good Foundation against the Time to come *. This will be the Means of making the Blessings of those, who are now rea­dy to perish through lack of Knowledge, descend at the last upon their Heads. This will be the Ground of joyful and comforting Reflections, when all the Pleasures of Life can please no more. What a Reproach is it to this Age of Va­nity and Pleasure, that no Assistance is denied, and no Expence is spared, to carry on every fa­vourite Scheme of Diversion and Amusement; and only pious and Publick-spirited Undertak­ings are neglected and suffered to languish!"
"I must mention one Consideration more, which render these Associations of good Men,  to promote Christian Knowledge, the more im­portant, and the more deserving of our Assist­ance at this Day. They are not only the Means of extending Christianity further than it has already reached, but likewise of support the Regard for it at Home. They preserve, at least, the Face of Seriousness amongst us, and contribute to recall something of that Zeal which has so much decayed. This renders them pecu­liarly seasonable now, when a Horror at Super­stition and Enthusiasm seems to have made us in­sensible to the Dangers of Irreligion, and of In­difference about all that is sacred: though  this last is certainly much more the general Characte­ristick of the present Times than the former; and threatens that Dissolution of Manners, which, if it become universal, must inevitably carry us with swift Steps to Ruin. As there­fore we have any Regard for the most valuable publick Interests, let us withstand the Torrent of Profanity, by giving all publick Testimonies of a just Concern for the Knowledge and Prin­ciples of our holy Religion. Let us both give them all the Countenance we can at home; and embrace every Occasion Providence gives us of extending their Influence further through the  World. Thus, whilst we act a Part which it is decent and becoming in Christians to act, we shall enjoy the Pleasure of having contributed our Endeavours for bringing about that happy Re­volution foretold by ancient Prophecy: When, in the Stile of Scripture, There shall be one Lord over all the Earth, and his Name, One *. ”When his Name shall be great from the rising to the setting Sun   ; when there shall be nothing to hurt nor destroy in all his holy Mountain; ”but Judgment shall dwell in the Wilderness, and Righteousness remain in the fruitful Field  ¡. ”The Desart shall rejoice and blossom as the Rose *. and The Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord as the Waters cover the Sea."

"PREFACE."
"THE following LECTURES were read in the University of Edin­burgh, for Twenty-four years. The publication of them, at present, was not altogether a matter of choice. Imperfect Copies of them, in Manu­script, from notes taken by Students who heard them read, were first pri­vately handed about; and afterwards frequently exposed to public sale. When the Author saw them circulate so currently, as even to be quoted in print*, and found himself often threatened with surreptitious publi­cations of them, he judged it to be high time that they should proceed from his own hand, rather than come into public view under some very defective and erroneous form."
"[Page  THEY were originally designed for the initiation of Youth into the stu­dy of Belles Lettres, and of Compo­sition. With the same intention they are now published; and, therefore, the form of Lectures, in which they were at first composed, is still retain  The Author gives them to the world, neither as a Work wholly ori­ginal, nor as a Compilation from the Writings of others. On every sub­ject contained in them, he has thought for himself. He consulted his own ideas and reflections: and a great part of what will be found in these Lec­tures is entirely his own. At the same time, he availed himself of the ideas and reflections of others, as far as he thought them proper to be adopted. To proceed in this man­ner, was his duty as a Public Professor. It was incumbent on him, to convey to his Pupils all the knowledge that could improve them; to deliver not merely what was new, but what might be useful, from whatever quarter it came. He hopes, that to such as are [Page  studying to cultivate their Taste, to form their Style, or to prepare them­selves for Public Speaking or Compo­sition, his Lectures will afford a more comprehensive view of what relates to these subjects, than, as far as he knows, is to be received from any one Book in our Language."
"IN order to render his Work of greater service, he has generally refer­red to the Books which he consulted, as far as he remembers them; that the Readers might be directed to any far­ther illustration which they afford. But, as such a length of time has elapsed since the first Composition of his Lectures, he may, perhaps, have adopted the sentiments of some Au­thor into whose Writings he had then looked, without now remembering whence he derived them."
"IN the opinions which he has deli­vered concerning such a variety of Authors, and of literary matters, as come under his consideration, he [Page  cannot expect that all his Readers will concur with him. The subjects are of such a nature; as allow room for much diversity of taste and senti­ment: and the Author will respect­fully submit to the judgment of the Public."
"RETAINING the simplicity of the Lecturing Style, as best fitted for conveying instruction, he has aimed, in his Language, at no more than perspicuity. If, after the liberties which it was necessary for him to take, in criticising the Style of the most eminent Writers in our lan­guage, his own Style shall be thought open to reprehension, all that he can say, is, that his Book will add one to the many proofs already afforded to the world, of its being much easier to give instruction, than to set exam­ple."

"LECTURE I. INTRODUCTION."
"ONE of the most distinguished privileges which Providence has conferred upon mankind, is the power of communicating their thoughts to one another. Destitute of this power, Reason would be a solitary, and, in some measure, an unavailing principle. Speech is the great instrument by which man becomes beneficial to man: and it is to the intercourse and transmission of thought, by means of speech, that we are chiefly indebt for the improvement of thought itself. Small are the advances which a single unas­sisted individual can make towards perfect any of his powers. What we call hu­man reason, is not the effort or ability of one, so much as it is the result of the reason of many, arising from lights mutually com­municated, in consequence of discourse and writing."
" IT is obvious, then, that writing and dis­course are objects intitled to the highest atten  Whether the influence of the speaker, or the entertainment of the hearer, be con­sulted; whether utility or pleasure be the principal aim in view, we are prompted, by the strongest motives, to study how we may communicate our thoughts to one another with most advantage. Accordingly we find, that in almost every nation, as soon as lan­guage had extended itself beyond that scanty communication which was requisite for the supply of men necessities, the improvement of discourse began to attract regard. In the language even of rude uncultivated tribes, we can trace some attention to the grace and force of those expressions which they used, when they sought to persuade or to affect. They were early sensible of a beauty in dis­course, and endeavoured to give it certain decorations which experience had taught them it was capable of receiving, long before the study of those decorations was formed in­to a regular art."
"BUT, among nations in a civilized state, no art has been cultivated with more care, than that of language, style, and composition. The attention paid to it may, indeed, be as­sumed as one mark of the progress of society towards its most improved period. For, ac­cording as society improves and flourishes, men acquire more influence over one ano­ther by means of reasoning and discourse;  and in proportion as that influence is felt to enlarge, it must follow, as a natural conse­quence, that they will bestow more care up­on the methods of expressing their concepti­ons with propriety and eloquence. Hence we find, that in all the polished nations of Eu­rope, this study has been treated as highly important, and has possessed a considerable place in every plan of liberal education."
"INDEED, when the arts of speech and writ are mentioned, I am sensible that preju­dices against them are apt to rise in the minds of many. A sort of art is immediately thought of, that is ostentatious and deceitful; the minute and trifling study of words alone; the pomp of expression; the studied fallacies of rhetoric; ornament substituted in the room of use. We need not wonder, that under such imputations, all study of dis­course as an art, should have suffered in the opinion of men of understanding: and I am far from denying, that rhetoric and criticism have sometimes been so managed as to tend to the corruption, rather than to the im­provement, of good taste and true eloquence. But sure it is equally possible to apply the principles of reason and good sense to this art, as to any other that is cultivated among men. If the following Lectures have any merit, it will consist in an endeavour to sub­stitute the application of these principles in the place of artificial and scholastic rhetoric; in an endeavour to explode false ornament,  to direct attention more towards substance than show, to recommend good sense as the foundation of all good composition, and sim­plicity as essential to all true ornament."
"WHEN entering on the subject, I may be allowed, on this occasion, to suggest a few thoughts concerning the importance and vantages of such studies, and the rank they are intitled to possess in academical educa . I am under no temptation, for this purpose, of extolling their importance at the expence of any other department of science. On the contrary, the study of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres supposes and requires a proper acquaintance with the rest of the liberal arts. It embraces them all within its circle, and recommends them to the highest regard. The first care of all such as wish either to write with reputation, or to speak in public so as to command attention, must be, to ex­tend their knowledge; to lay in a rich store of ideas relating to those subjects of which the occasions of life may call them to dis­course or to write. Hence, among the an­cients, it was a fundamental principle, and frequently inculcated, Quod omnibus dis­ciplinis  et artibus debet esse instructus ora­tor; that the orator ought to be an ac­complished scholar, and conversant in every part of learning. It is indeed impossible to contrive an art, and very pernicious it were if it could be contrived, which should give the stamp of merit to any composition rich or splendid in expression, but barren or er­roneous in thought. They are the wretch attempts towards an art of this kind which have so often disgraced oratory, and debased it below its true standard. The graces of composition have been em­ployed to disguise or to supply the want of matter; and the temporary applause of the ignorant has been courted, instead of the lasting approbation of the discerning. But such imposture can never maintain its ground long. Knowledge and science must furnish the materials that form the body and sub­stance of any valuable composition. Rhe­toric serves to add the polish; and we know that none but firm and solid bodies can be polished well."
"OF those who peruse the following Lec­tures, some, by the profession to which they addict themselves, or in consequence of their prevailing inclination, may have the view of being employed in composition, or in public speaking. Others, without any prospect of this kind, may wish only to improve their taste with respect to writing and discourse, and to acquire principles which will enable  them to judge for themselves in that part of literature called the Belles Lettres."
"WITH respect to the former, such as may have occasion to communicate their senti­ments to the Public, it is abundantly clear that some preparation of study is requisite for the end which they have in view. To speak or to write perspicuously and agreea­bly, with purity, with grace and strength, are attainments of the utmost consequence to all who purpose, either by speech or writing, to address the Public. For without being master of those attainments, no man can do justice to his own conceptions; but how rich soever he may be in knowledge and in good sense, will be able to avail himself less of those treasures, than such as possess not half his store, but who can display what they possess with more propriety. Neither are these attainments of that kind for which we are indebted to nature merely. Nature has, indeed, conferred upon some a very favour­able distinction in this respect, beyond others. But in these, as in most other talents she bestows, she has left much to be wrought out by every man own industry. So conspicu­ous have been the effects of study and im­provement in every part of eloquence; such remarkable examples have appeared of per­sons surmounting, by their diligence, the dis­advantages of the most untoward nature, that among the learned it has long been a con­tested, and remains still an undecided point,  whether nature or art confer most towards excelling in writing and discourse."
"WITH respect to the manner in which art can most effectually furnish assistance for such a purpose, there may be diversity of opinions. I by no means pretend to say that mere rhetorical rules, how just soever, are sufficient to form an orator. Supposing natural genius to be favourable, more by a great deal will depend upon private applica and study, than upon any system of in­struction that is capable of being publicly communicated. But at the same time, though rules and instructions cannot do all that is requisite, they may, however, do much that is of real use. They cannot, it is true, inspire genius; but they can direct and assist it. They cannot remedy barren­ness; but they may correct redundancy. They point out proper models for imitation. They bring into view the chief beauties that ought to be studied, and the principal faults that ought to be avoided; and thereby tend to enlighten taste, and to lead genius from unnatural deviations, into its proper chan­nel. What would not avail for the produc of great excellencies, may at least serve to prevent the commission of considerable errors."
"ALL that regards the study of eloquence and composition, merits the higher attention upon this account, that it is intimately con­nected  with the improvement of our intel­lectual powers. For I must be allowed to say, that when we are employed, after a proper manner, in the study of composition, we are cultivating reason itself. True rhe­toric and sound logic are very nearly allied. The study of arranging and expressing our thoughts with propriety, teaches to think, as well as to speak, accurately. By putting our sentiments into words, we always con­ceive them more distinctly. Every one who has the slightest acquaintance with composi knows, that when he expresses himself ill on any subject, when his arrangement becomes loose, and his sentences turn feeble, the defects of his style can, almost on every occasion, be traced back to his indistinct conception of the subject: so close is the connection between thoughts and the words in which they are clothed."
"THE study of composition, important in itself at all times, has acquired additional importance from the taste and manners of the present age. It is an age wherein im­provements, in every part of science, have been prosecuted with ardour. To all the liberal arts much attention has been paid; and to none more than to the beauty of lan­guage, and the grace and elegance of every kind of writing. The public ear is become refined. It will not easily bear what is slo­venly and incorrect. Every author must aspire to some merit in expression, as well  as in sentiment, if he would not incur the danger of being neglected and despised."
"I WILL not deny that the love of minute elegance, and attention to inferior ornaments of composition, may at present have en­grossed too great a degree of the public re­gard. It is indeed my opinion, that we lean to this extreme; often more careful of po­lishing style, than of storing it with thought. Yet hence arises a new reason for the study of just and proper composition. If it be re­quisite not to be deficient in elegance or or­nament in times when they are in such high estimation, it is still more requisite to attain the power of distinguishing false ornament from true, in order to prevent our being carried away by that torrent of false and fri­volous taste, which never fails, when it is prevalent, to sweep along with it the raw and the ignorant. They who have never studied eloquence in its principles, nor have been trained to attend to the genuine and manly beauties of good writing, are always ready to be caught by the mere glare of lan­guage; and when they come to speak in public, or to compose, have no other stan­dard on which to form themselves, except what chances to be fashionable and popular, how corrupted soever, or erroneous, that may be."
"BUT as there are many who have no such objects as either composition or public speak  in view, let us next consider what vantages may be derived by them, from such studies as form the subject of these Lectures. To them, rhetoric is not so much a practical art as a speculative science; and the same instructions which assist others in composing, will assist them in judging of, and relishing, the beauties of composition. Whatever en­ables genius to execute well, will enable taste to criticise justly."
"WHEN we name criticising, prejudices may perhaps arise, of the same kind with those which I mentioned before with respect to rhetoric. As rhetoric has been sometimes thought to signify nothing more than the scholastic study of words, and phrases, and tropes, so criticism has been considered as merely the art of finding faults; as the fri­gid application of certain technical terms, by means of which persons are taught to cavil and censure in a learned manner. But this is the criticism of pedants only. True criti­cism is a liberal and humane art. It is the offspring of good sense and refined taste. It aims at acquiring a just discernment of the real merit of authors. It promotes a lively relish of their beauties, while it preserves us from that blind and implicit veneration which would confound their beauties and faults in our esteem. It teaches us, in a word, to mire and to blame with judgment, and not to follow the crowd blindly."
" IN an age when works of genius and lite­rature are so frequently the subjects of dis­course, when every one erects himself into a judge, and when we can hardly mingle in po­lite society without bearing some share in such discussions; studies of this kind, it is not to be doubted, will appear to derive part of their importance from the use to which they may be applied in furnishing materials for those fashionable topics of discourse, and thereby enabling us to support a proper rank in social life."
"BUT I should be sorry if we could not rest the merit of such studies on somewhat of so­lid and intrinsical use independent of appear­ance and show. The exercise of taste and of sound criticism, is in truth one of the most improving employments of the understanding. To apply the principles of good sense to com­position and discourse; to examine what is beautiful, and why it is so; to employ our­selves in distinguishing accurately between the specious and the solid, between affected and natural ornament, must certainly im­prove us not a little in the most valuable part of all philosophy, the philosophy of human nature. For such disquisitions are very inti­mately connected with the knowledge of our­selves. They necessarily lead us to reflect on the operations of the imagination, and the movements of the heart; and increase our acquaintance with some of the most refined feelings which belong to our frame."
" LOGICAL and Ethical disquisitions move in a higher sphere; and are conversant with objects of a more severe kind; the progress of the understanding in its search after know­ledge, and the direction of the will in the proper pursuit of good. In these they point out to man the improvement of his nature as an intelligent being; and his duties as the subject of moral obligation. Belles Lettres and criticism chiefly consider him as a Being endowed with those powers of taste and ima­gination, which were intended to embellish his mind, and to supply him with rational and useful entertainment. They open a field of investigation peculiar to themselves. All that relates to beauty, harmony, gran­deur, and elegance; all that can sooth the mind, gratify the fancy, or move the affecti­ons, belongs to their province. They pre­sent human nature under a different aspect from that which it assumes to the view of other sciences. They bring to light various springs of action which without their aid might have passed unobserved; and which, though of a delicate nature, frequently exert a powerful influence on several departments of human life."
"SUCH studies have also this peculiar advan­tage, that they exercise our reason without fatiguing it. They lead to enquiries acute, but not painful; profound, but not dry nor abstruse. They strew flowers in the path of science; and while they keep the mind bent,  in some degree, and active, they relieve it at the same time from that more toilsome labour to which it must submit in the acquisition of necessary erudition, or the investigation of abstract truth."
"THE cultivation of taste is farther recom­mended by the happy effects which it natu­rally tends to produce on human life. The most busy man, in the most active sphere, cannot be always occupied by business. Men of serious professions cannot always be on the stretch of serious thought. Neither can the most gay and flourishing situations of fortune afford any man the power of filling all his hours with pleasure. Life must al­ways languish in the hands of the idle. It will frequently languish even in the hands of the busy, if they have not some employment subsidiary to that which forms their main pursuit. How then shall these vacant spaces, those unemployed intervals, which, more or less, occur in the life of every one, be filled up? How can we contrive to dispose of them in any way that shall be more agreeable in itself, or more consonant to the dignity of the human mind, than in the entertainments of taste, and the study of polite literature? He who is so happy as to have acquired a re­lish for these, has always at hand an inno­cent and irreproachable amusement for his leisure hours, to save him from the danger of many a pernicious passion. He is not in ha­zard of being a burden to himself. He is not  obliged to fly to low company, or to court the riot of loose pleasures, in order to cure the tediousness of existence."
"PROVIDENCE seems plainly to have point out this useful purpose to which the plea­sures of taste may be applied, by interposing them in a middle station between the plea­sures of sense, and those of pure intellect. We were not designed to grovel always among objects so low as the former; nor are we capable of dwelling constantly in so high a region as the latter. The pleasures of taste refresh the mind after the toils of the intel­lect, and the labours of abstract study; and they gradually raise it above the attachments of sense, and prepare it for the enjoyments of virtue."
"SO consonant is this to experience, that in the education of youth, no object has in every age appeared more important to wise men, than to tincture them early with a re­lish for the entertainments of taste. The transition is commonly made with ease from these to the discharge of the higher and more important duties of life. Good hopes may be entertained of those whose minds have this liberal and elegant turn. Many virtues may be grafted upon it. Whereas to be en­tirely devoid of relish for eloquence, poetry, or any of the fine arts, is justly constructed to be an unpromising symptom of youth; and raises suspicions of their being prone to  low gratifications, or destined to drudge in the more vulgar and illiberal pursuits of life."
"THERE are indeed few good dispositions of any kind with which the improvement of taste is not more or less connected. A cul­tivated taste increases sensibility to all the tender and humane passions, by giving them frequent exercise; while it tends to weaken the more violent and fierce emotions."
" ”Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes"
"Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros*."
"The elevated sentiments and high examples which poetry, eloquence and history are often bringing under our view, naturally tend to nourish in our minds public spirit, the love of glory, contempt of external fortune, and the admiration of what is truly illustrious and great."
"I WILL not go so far as to say that the improvement of taste and of virtue is the same; or that they may always be expected to coexist in an equal degree. More power­ful correctives than taste can apply, are ne­cessary for reforming the corrupt propensi­ties which too frequently prevail among man­kind. Elegant speculations are sometimes  found to float on the surface of the mind, while bad passions possess the interior regi­ons of the heart. At the same time this cannot but be admitted, that the exercise of taste is, in its native tendency, moral and purifying. From reading the most admired productions of genius, whether in poetry or prose, almost every one rises with some good impressions left on his mind; and though these may not always be durable, they are at least to be ranked among the means of dis­posing the heart to virtue. One thing is certain, and I shall hereafter have occasion to illustrate it more fully, that without pos­sessing the virtuous affections in a strong gree, no man can attain eminence in the sublime parts of eloquence. He must feel what a good man feels, if he expects greatly to move or to interest mankind. They are the ardent sentiments of honour, virtue, magnanimity, and publick spirit, that only can kindle that fire of genius, and call up into the mind those high ideas, which attract the admiration of ages; and if this spirit be necessary to produce the most distinguished efforts of eloquence, it must be necessary also to our relishing them with proper taste and feeling."
"ON these general topics I shall dwell no longer; but proceed directly to the conside­ration of the subjects which are to employ the following Lectures. They divide them­selves into five parts. First, some introduc­tory  dissertations on the nature of taste, and upon the sources of its pleasures. Second­ly, the consideration of language: Thirdly, of style: Fourthly, of eloquence properly so called, or publick speaking in its different kinds. Lastly, a critical examination of the most distinguished species of composition, both in prose and verse."
"LECTURE  TASTE."
"THE nature of the present undertaking leads me to begin with some enquiries concerning Taste, as it is this faculty which is always appealed to in disquisitions concern the merit of discourse and writing."
"THERE are few subjects on which men talk more loosely and indistinctly than on Taste; few which it is more difficult to ex­plain with precision; and none which in this Course of Lectures will appear more dry or abstract. What I have to say on the subject shall be in the following order. I shall first explain the Nature of Taste as a power or faculty in the human mind. I shall next consider how far it is an improveable faculty. I shall shew the sources of its improvement, and the characters of taste in its most perfect state. I shall then examine the various fluc­tuations to which it is liable, and enquire  whether there be any standard to which we can bring the different tastes of men, in or­der to distinguish the corrupted from the true."
"TASTE may be defined The power of receiving pleasure from the beauties of na­ture and of art. The first question that occurs concerning it is, whether it is to be considered as an internal sense, or as an exer of reason? Reason is a very general term; but if we understand by it, that pow­er of the mind which in speculative matters discovers truth, and in practical matters judges of the fitness of means to an end, I apprehend the question may be easily an­swered. For nothing can be more clear, than that taste is not resolveable into any such operation of Reason. It is not merely through a discovery of the understanding or a deduc of argument, that the mind receives plea­sure from a beautiful prospect or a fine poem. Such objects often strike us intuitively, and make a strong impression when we are un­able to assign the reasons of our being pleas  They sometimes strike in the same man­ner the philosopher and the peasant; the boy and the man. Hence the faculty by which we relish such beauties, seems more a-kin to a feeling of sense, than to a process of the understanding: and accordingly from an ex­ternal sense it has borrowed its name; that sense by which we receive and distinguish the pleasures of food having, in several lan­guages,  given rise to the word Taste in the metaphorical meaning under which we now consider it. However, as in all subjects which regard the operations of the mind, the inac­curate use of words is to be carefully avoid  it must not be inferred from what I have said, that reason is excluded from the exer­tions of taste. Though taste, beyond doubt, be ultimately founded on a certain natural and instinctive sensibility to beauty, yet rea­son, as I shall shew hereafter, assists Taste in many of its operations, and serves to enlarge its power*."
"TASTE, in the sense in which I have ex­plained it, is a faculty common in some gree to all men. Nothing that belongs to human nature is more universal than the re­lish of beauty of one kind or other; of what is orderly, proportioned, grand, harmonious, new, or sprightly. In children, the rudiments of Taste discover themselves very early in a thousand instances; in their fondness for re­gular bodies, their admiration of pictures and statues, and imitations of all kinds; and their strong attachment to whatever is new or marvellous. The most ignorant peasants are delighted with ballads and tales, and are  struck with the beautiful appearances of na­ture in the earth and heavens. Even in the desarts of America, where human nature shews itself in its most uncultivated state, the sa­vages have their ornaments of dress, their war and their death songs, their harangues, and their orators. We must therefore conclude the principles of Taste to be deeply founded in the human mind. It is no less essential to man to have some discernment of beauty, than it is to possess the attributes of reason and of speech*."
" BUT although none be wholly devoid of this faculty, yet the degrees in which it is possessed are widely different. In some men only the feeble glimmerings of Taste appear; the beauties which they relish are of the coarsest kind; and of these they have but a weak and confused impression: while in others, Taste rises to an acute discernment, and a lively enjoyment of the most refined beauties. In general, we may observe, that in the powers and pleasures of Taste, there is a more remarkable inequality among men than is usually found in point of common sense, reason, and judgment. The constitu of our nature in this, as in all other res­pects, discovers admirable wisdom. In the distribution of those talents which are neces­sary for man well-being, Nature hath made less distinction among her children. But in the distribution of those which belong only to the ornamental part of life, she hath bestow her favours with more frugality. She hath both sown the seeds more sparingly; and rendered a higher culture requisite for bringing them to perfection."
"THIS inequality of Taste among men is owing, without doubt, in part, to the differ­ent frame of their natures; to nicer organs, and finer internal powers, with which some are endowed beyond others. But, if it be owing in part to nature, it is owing to edu­cation and culture still more. The illustra of this leads to my next remark on this  subject, that Taste is a most improveable fa­culty, if there be any such in human nature; a remark which gives great encouragement to such a course of study as we are now pro­posing to pursue. Of the truth of this asser we may easily be convinced, by only reflecting on that immense superiority which education and improvement give to civilized, above barbarous nations, in refinement of Taste; and on the superiority which they give in the same nation to those who have studied the liberal arts, above the rude and untaught vulgar. The difference is so great, that there is perhaps no one particular in which these two classes of men are so far removed from each other, as in respect of the powers and the pleasures of Taste: and assuredly for this difference no other general cause can be assigned, but culture and edu­cation. ”I shall now proceed to shew what the means are, by which Taste becomes so remarkably susceptible of cultivation and progress."
"REFLECT first upon that great law of our nature, that exercise is the chief source of improvement in all our faculties. This holds both in our bodily, and in our mental powers. It holds even in our external senses; although these be less the subject of cultivation than any of our other faculties. We see how acute the senses become in per­sons whose trade or business leads to nice ex­ertions of them. Touch, for instance, be­comes  infinitely more exquisite in men whose employment requires them to examine the polish of bodies, than it is in others. They who deal in microscopical observations, or are accustomed to engrave on precious stones, acquire surprising accuracy of sight in dis­cerning the minutest objects; and practice in attending to different flavours and tastes of liquors, wonderfully improves the power of distinguishing them, and of tracing their composition. Placing internal Taste there­fore on the footing of a simple sense, it can­not be doubted that frequent exercise, and curious attention to its proper objects, must greatly heighten its power. Of this we have one clear proof in that part of Taste, which is called an ear for music. Experience every days shews, that nothing is more improvea­ble. Only the simplest and plainest compo­sitions are relished at first; use and practice extend our pleasure; teach us to relish finer melody, and by degrees enable us to enter into the intricate and compounded pleasures of harmony. So an eye for the beauties of painting is never all at once acquired. It is gradually formed by being conversant among pictures, and studying the works of the best masters."
"PRECISELY in the same manner, with re­spect to the beauty of composition and dis­course, attention to the most approved mo­dels, study of the best authors, comparisons of lower and higher degrees of the same  beauties, operate towards the refinement of Taste. When one is only beginning his ac­quaintance with works of genius, the senti­ment which attends them is obscure and con­fused. He cannot point out the several ex­cellencies or blemishes of a performance which he peruses; he is at a loss on what to rest his judgment; all that can be expected is, that he should tell in general whether he be pleased or not. But allow him more ex­perience in works of this kind, and his Taste becomes by degrees more exact and enlight­ened. He begins to perceive not only the character of the whole, but the beauties and defects of each part; and is able to describe the peculiar qualities which he praises or blames. The mist dissipates which seemed formerly to hang over the object; and he can at length pronounce firmly, and without hesitation, concerning it. Thus in Taste, considered as mere sensibility, exercise opens a great source of improvement."
"BUT although Taste be ultimately found on sensibility, it must not be considered as instinctive sensibility alone. Reason and good sense, as I before hinted, have so ex­tensive an influence on all the operations and decisions of Taste, that a thorough good Taste may well be considered as a power compounded of natural sensibility to beauty, and of improved understanding. In order to be satisfied of this, let us observe, that the greater part of the productions of ge­nius  are no other than imitations of nature; representations of the characters, actions, or manners of men. The pleasure we receive from such imitations or representations is founded on mere Taste: but to judge whe­ther they be properly executed, belongs to the understanding, which compares the copy with the original."
"IN reading, for instance, such a poem as the Aeneid, a great part of our pleasure arises from the plan or story being well conducted, and all the parts joined together with proba­bility and due connection  from the charac­ters being taken from nature, the sentiments being suited to the characters, and the style to the sentiments. The pleasure which arises from a poem so conducted, is felt or enjoyed by Taste as an internal sense; but the disco­very of this conduct in the poem is owing to reason; and the more that reason enables us to discover such propriety in the conduct, the greater will be our pleasure. We are pleased, through our natural sense of beau­ty. Reason shews us why, and upon what grounds, we are pleased. Wherever in works of Taste, any resemblance to nature is aimed at; wherever there is any reference of parts to a whole, or of means to an end, as there is indeed in almost every writing and discourse, there the understanding must al­ways have a great part to act."
" HERE then is a wide field for reason ex­erting its powers in relation to the objects of Taste, particularly with respect to composi  and works of genius; and hence arises a second and a very considerable source of the improvement of Taste, from the appli­cation of reason and good sense to such pro­ductions of genius. Spurious beauties, such as unnatural characters, forced sentiments, affected style, may please for a little; but they please only because their opposition to nature and to good sense has not been exa­mined, or attended to. Once shew how na­ture might have been more justly imitated or represented: how the writer might have ma­naged his subject to greater advantage; the illusion will presently be dissipated, and those false beauties will please no more."
"FROM these two sources then, first, the frequent exercise of Taste, and next the ap­plication of good sense and reason to the ob­jects of Taste, Taste as a power of the mind receives its improvement. In its perfect state, it is undoubtedly the result both of nature and of art. It supposes our natural sense of beauty to be refined by frequent attention to the most beautiful objects, and at the same time to be guided and improved by the light of the understanding."
"I MUST be allowed to add, that as a sound head, so likewise a good heart, is a very ma­terial requisite to just Taste. The moral  beauties are not only in themselves superiour to all others, but they exert an influence, either more near or more remote, on a great variety of other objects of Taste. Wherever the affections, characters, or actions of men are concerned (and these certainly afford the noblest subjects to genius), there can be nei­ther any just or affecting description of them, nor any thorough feeling of the beauty of that description, without our possessing the virtuous affections. He whose heart is in­delicate or hard, he who has no admiration of what is truly noble or praiseworthy, nor the proper sympathetic sense of what is soft and tender, must have a very imperfect re­lish of the highest beauties of eloquence and poetry."
"THE characters of Taste when brought to its most perfect state are all reducible to two, Delicacy and Correctness."
"DELICACY of Taste respects principally the perfection of that natural sensibility on which Taste is founded. It implies those finer organs or powers which enable us to discover beauties that lie hid from a vulgar eye. One may have strong sensibility, and yet be deficient in delicate Taste. He may be deeply impressed by such beauties as he perceives; but he perceives only what is in some degree coarse, what is bold and palpa­ble; while chaster and simpler ornaments escape his notice. In this state Taste gene­rally  exists among rude and unrefined nati­ons. But a person of delicate Taste both feels strongly, and feels accurately. He sees distinctions and differences where others see none; the most latent beauty does not escape him, and he is sensible of the smallest ble­mish. Delicacy of Taste is judged of by the same marks that we use in judging of the delicacy of an external sense. As the good­ness of the palate is not tried by strong fla­vours, but by a mixture of ingredients, where, notwithstanding the confusion, we remain sensible of each; in like manner licacy of internal Taste appears, by a quick and lively sensibility to its finest, most com­pounded, or most latent objects."
"CORRECTNESS of Taste respects chiefly the improvement which that faculty receives through its connection with the understand  A man of correct Taste is one who is never imposed on by counterfeit beauties; who carries always in his mind that standard of good sense which he employs in judging of every thing. He estimates with propriety the comparative merit of the several beauties which he meets with in any work of genius; refers them to their proper classes; assigns the principles, as far as they can be traced, whence their power of pleasing us flows; and is pleased himself precisely in that gree in which he ought, and no more."
" IT is true that these two qualities of Taste, Delicacy and Correctness, mutually imply each other. No Taste can be exquisitely licate without being correct; nor can be though roughly correct without being delicate. But still a predominancy of one or other quality in the mixture is often visible. The power of Delicacy is chiefly seen in discerning the true merit of a work; the power of Correct­ness, in rejecting false pretensions to merit. Delicacy leans more to feeling; Correctness more to reason and judgment. The former is more the gift of nature; the latter, more the product of culture and art. Among the ancient critics, Longinus possessed most Deli­cacy; Aristotle, most Correctness. Among the moderns, Mr. Addison is a high example of delicate Taste; Dean Swift, had he writ­ten on the subject of criticism, would per­haps have afforded the example of a correct one."
"HAVING viewed Taste in its most improv and perfect state, I come next to consider its deviations from that state, the fluctuati­ons and changes to which it is liable; and to enquire whether, in the midst of these, there be any means of distinguishing a true from a corrupted Taste. This brings us to the most difficult part of our task. For it must be acknowledged, that no principle of the human mind is, in its operations, more fluc­tuating and capricious than Taste. Its vari­ations have been so great and frequent, as to  create a suspicion with some, of its being merely arbitrary; grounded on no founda  ascertainable by no standard, but wholly dependent on changing fancy; the conse­quence of which would be, that all studies or regular enquiries concerning the objects of Taste were vain. In architecture, the Grecian models were long esteemed the most perfect. In succeeding ages, the Gothic architecture alone prevailed, and afterwards the Grecian Taste revived in all its vigour, and engrossed the public admiration. In elo­quence and poetry, the Asiatics at no time relished any thing but what was full of orna­ment, and splendid in a degree that we would denominate gawdy; whilst the Greeks mired only chaste and simple beauties, and despised the Asiatic ostentation. In our own country, how many writings that were great­ly extolled two or three centuries ago, are now fallen into entire disrepute and oblivi­on? Without going back to remote instances, how very different is the taste of poetry which prevails in Great Britain now, from what pre­vailed there no longer ago than the reign of king Charles  which the authors too of that time deemed an Augustan age: when nothing was in vogue but an affected bril­liancy of wit; when the simple majesty of Milton was overlooked, and Paradise Lost almost entirely unknown; when Cowley laboured and unnatural conceits were mired as the very quintessence of genius; Waller gay sprightliness was mistaken for  the tender spirit of Love poetry; and such writers as Suckling and Etheridge were held in esteem for dramatic composition?"
"THE question is, what conclusion we are to form from such instances as these? Is there any thing that can be called a standard of Taste, by appealing to which we may distin­guish between a good and a bad Taste? Or, is there in truth no such distinction; and are we to hold that, according to the proverb, there is no disputing of Tastes; but that whatever pleases is right, for that reason that it does please? This is the question, and a very nice and subtile one it is, which we are now to discuss."
"I BEGIN by observing, that if there be no such thing as any standard of Taste, this consequence must immediately follow, that all Tastes are equally good; a position, which though it may pass unnoticed in slight mat­ters, and when we speak of the lesser differ­ences among the Tastes of men, yet when we apply it to the extremes, its absurdity presently becomes glaring. For is there any one who will seriously maintain that the Taste of a Hottentot or a Laplander is as delicate and as correct as that of a Longinus or an Addison? or, that he can be charged with no defect or incapacity who thinks a common news-writer as excellent an Histo­rian as Tacitus? As it would be held down­right extravagance to talk in this manner, we  are led unavoidably to this conclusion, that there is some foundation for the preference of one man Taste to that of another; or, that there is a good and a bad, right and a wrong in Taste, as in other things."
"BUT to prevent mistakes on this subject, it is necessary to observe next, that the di­versity of Tastes which prevails among man­kind, does not in every case infer corrup of Taste, or oblige us to seek for some standard in order to determine who are in the right. The Tastes of men may differ very considerably as to their object, and yet none of them be wrong. One man relishes Poetry most; another takes pleasure in no­thing but History. One prefers Comedy; another, Tragedy. One admires the simple; another, the ornamented style. The young are amused with gay and sprightly composi­tions. The elderly are more entertained with those of a graver cast. Some nations delight in bold pictures of manners, and strong representations of passion. Others incline to more correct and regular elegance both in description and sentiment. Though all differ, yet all pitch upon some one beau­ty which peculiarly suits their turn of mind; and therefore no one has a title to condemn the rest. It is not in matters of Taste, as in questions of mere reason, where there is but one conclusion that can be true, and all the rest are erroneous. Truth, which is the object of reason, is one; Beauty, which is  the object of Taste, is manifold. Taste therefore admits of latitude and diversity of objects, in sufficient consistency with good­ness or justness of Taste."
"BUT then, to explain this matter though roughly, I must observe farther, that this admissible diversity of Tastes can only have place where the objects of Taste are differ­ent. Where it is with respect to the same object that men disagree, when one con­demns that as ugly, which another admires as highly beautiful; then it is no longer di­versity, but direct opposition of Taste that takes place; and therefore one must be in the right, and another in the wrong, unless that absurd paradox were allowed to hold, that all Tastes are equally good and true. One man prefers Virgil to Homer. Suppose that I, on the other hand, admire Homer more than Virgil. I have as yet no reason to say that our Tastes are contradictory. The other person is most struck with the elegance and tenderness which are the cha­racteristics of Virgil; I, with the simplicity and fire of Homer. As long as neither of us deny that both Homer and Virgil have great beauties, our difference falls within the compass of that diversity of Tastes, which I have shewed to be natural and allowable. But if the other man shall assert that Ho­mer has no beauties whatever; that he holds him to be a dull and spiritless writer, and that he would as soon peruse any old legend  of Knight-Errantry as the Iliad; then I ex­claim, that my antagonist either is void of all Taste, or that his Taste is corrupted in a miserable degree; and I appeal to whatever I think the standard of Taste, to shew him that he is in the wrong."
"WHAT that standard is, to which, in such opposition of Tastes, we are obliged to have recourse, remains to be traced. A standard properly signifies, that which is of such un­doubted authority as to be the test of other things of the same kind. Thus a standard weight or measure, is that which is appoint by law to regulate all other measures and weights. Thus the court is said to be the standard of good breeding; and the scrip­ture, of theological truth."
"WHEN we say that nature is the standard of Taste, we lay down a principle very true and just, as far as it can be applied. There is no doubt, that in all cases where an imita is intended of some object that exists in nature, as in representing human characters or actions, conformity to nature affords a full and distinct criterion of what is truly beautiful. Reason hath in such cases full scope for exerting its authority; for approv or condemning; by comparing the copy with the original. But there are innumera­ble cases in which this rule cannot be at all applied; and conformity to nature, is an expression frequently used, without any dis­tinct  or determinate meaning. We must therefore search for somewhat that can be rendered more clear and precise, to be the standard of Taste."
"TASTE, as I before explained it, is ulti­mately founded on an internal sense of beau­ty, which is natural to men, and which, in its application to particular objects, is capa­ble of being guided and enlightened by rea­son. Now, were there any one person who possessed in full perfection all the powers of human nature, whose internal senses were in every instance exquisite and just, and whose reason was unerring and sure, the determinations of such a person concerning beauty, would, beyond doubt, be a perfect standard for the Taste of all others. Where­ever their Taste differed from his, it could be imputed only to some imperfection in their natural powers. But as there is no such living standard, no one person to whom all mankind will allow such submission to be due, what is there of sufficient authority to be the standard of the various and opposite Tastes of men? Most certainly there is no­thing but the Taste, as far as it can be ga­thered, of human nature. That which men concur the most in admiring, must be held to be beautiful. His Taste must be esteem just and true, which coincides with the general sentiments of men. In this standard we must rest. To the sense of mankind the ultimate appeal must ever lie, in all works  of Taste. If any one should maintain that sugar was bitter and tobacco was sweet, no reasonings could avail to prove it. The Taste of such a person would infallibly be held to be diseased, merely because it differed so widely from the Taste of the species to which he belongs. In like manner, with re­gard to the objects of sentiment or internal Taste, the common feelings of men carry the same authority, and have a title to regulate the Taste of every individual."
"BUT have we then, it will be said, no other criterion of what is beautiful, than the appro­bation of the majority? Must we collect the voices of others, before we form any judg­ment for ourselves, of what deserves applause in Eloquence or Poetry? By no means; there are principles of reason and sound judgment which can be applied to matters of Taste, as well as to the subjects of sci­ence and philosophy. He who admires or censures any work of genius, is always rea­dy, if his Taste be in any degree improved, to assign some reasons of his decision. He appeals to principles, and points out the grounds on which he proceeds. Taste is a sort of compound power, in which the light of the understanding always mingles, more or less, with the feelings of sentiment."
"BUT, though reason can carry us a cer­tain length in judging concerning works of Taste, it is not to be forgotten that the ulti­mate  conclusions to which our reasonings lead, refer at last to sense and perception. We may speculate and argue concerning pro­priety of conduct in a Tragedy, or an Epic Poem. Just reasonings on the subject will correct the caprice of unenlightened Taste, and establish principles for judging of what deserves praise. But, at the same time, these reasonings appeal always, in the last resort, to feeling. The foundation upon which they rest, is what has been found from experience to please mankind most universally. Upon this ground we prefer a simple and natural, to an artificial and affected style; a regular and well-connected story, to loose and scat­tered narratives; a catastrophe which is ten­der and pathetic, to one which leaves us un­moved. It is from consulting our own ima­gination and heart, and from attending to the feelings of others, that any principles are formed which acquire authority in mat­ters of Taste*."
" WHEN we refer to the concurring senti­ments of men as the ultimate test of what is to be accounted beautiful in the arts, this is to be always understood of men placed in such situations as are favourable to the pro­per exertions of Taste. Every one must perceive, that among rude and uncivilized nations, and during the ages of ignorance and darkness, any loose notions that are en­tertained concerning such subjects carry no authority. In those states of society, Taste has no materials on which to operate. It is either totally suppressed, or appears in its lowest and most imperfect form. We refer to the sentiments of mankind in polished and flourishing nations; when arts are cul­tivated and manners refined; when works of genius are subjected to free discussion, and Taste is improved by Science and phi­losophy."
"EVEN among nations, at such a period of society, I admit, that accidental causes may occasionally warp the proper operations of Taste; sometimes the state of religion, some­times  the form of government, may for a while pervert it; a licentious court may in­troduce a taste for false ornaments, and dis­solute writings. The usage of one admired genius may procure approbation for his faults, and even render them fashionable. Some­times envy may have power to bear down, for a little, productions of great merit; while popular humour, or party spirit, may, at other times, exalt to a high, though short-lived, re­putation, what little deserved it. But though such casual circumstances give the appear­ance of caprice to the judgments of Taste, that appearance is easily corrected. In the course of time, the genuine taste of human nature never fails to disclose itself, and to gain the ascendant over any fantastic and corrupt modes of Taste which may chance to have been introduced. These may have currency for a while, and mislead superficial judges; but being subjected to examination, by grees they pass away; while that alone re­mains which is founded on sound reason, and tha native feelings of men."
"I BY no means pretend, that there is any standard of Taste, to which, in every parti­cular instance, we can resort for clear and immediate determination. Where, indeed, is such a standard to be found for deciding any of those great controversies in reason and philosophy, which perpetually divide mankind? In the present case, there was plainly no occasion for any such strict and  absolute provision to be made. In order to judge of what is morally good or evil, of what man ought, or ought not in duty to do, it was fit that the means of clear and precise determination should be afforded us. But to ascertain in every case with the utmost exact­ness what is beautiful or elegant, was not at all necessary to the happiness of man. And therefore some diversity in feeling was here allowed to take place; and room was left for discussion and debate, concerning the degree of approbation to which any work of genius is entitled."
"THE conclusion, which it is sufficient for us to rest upon, is, that Taste is far from be an arbitrary principle, which is subject to the fancy of every individual, and which mits of no criterion for determining whether it be false or true. Its foundation is the same in all human minds. It is built upon sentiments and perceptions which belong to our nature; and which, in general, operate with the same uniformity as our other intel­lectual principles. When these sentiments are perverted by ignorance and prejudice, they are capable of being rectified by reason. Their sound and natural state is ultimately determined, by comparing them with the general Taste of mankind. Let men declaim as much as they please, concerning the ca­price and the uncertainty of Taste, it is found, by experience, that there are beauties, which, if they be displayed in a proper light, have  power to command lasting and general admi­ration. In every composition, what interests the imagination, and touches the heart, pleases all ages and all nations. There is a certain string, which, being properly struck, the hu­man heart is so made as to answer to it."
"HENCE the universal testimony which the most improved nations of the earth have conspired, throughout a long tract of ages, to give to some few works of genius; such as the Iliad of Homer, and the Aeneid of Virgil. Hence the authority which such works have acquired, as standards in some degree of po­etical composition; since from them we are enabled to collect what the sense of mankind is, concerning those beauties which give them the highest pleasure, and which therefore po­etry ought to exhibit. Authority or preju­dice may, in one age or country, give a tem­porary reputation to an indifferent poet, or a bad artist; but when foreigners, or when posterity examine his works, his faults are discerned, and the genuine Taste of human nature appears. Opinionum commenta let dies; naturae judicia confirmat. Time overthrows the illusions of opinion, but esta­blishes the decisions of nature."
"LECTURE III. CRITICISM. ”GENIUS. ”PLEASURES OF TASTE. ”SUBLIMITY IN OBJECTS."
"TASTE, Criticism, and Genius, are words currently employed, without distinct ideas annexed to them. In begin­ning a course of Lectures where such words must often occur, it is necessary to ascertain their meaning with some precision. Having in the last Lecture treated of Taste, I pro­ceed to explain the nature and foundation of Criticism. True Criticism is the applica of Taste and of good sense to the seve­ral fine arts. The object which it proposes is, to distinguish what is beautiful and what is faulty in every performance; from parti­cular instances to ascend to general princi­ples; and so to form rules or conclusions concerning the several kinds of beauty in works of Genius."
" THE rules of Criticism are not formed by any induction, Ã  priori, as it is called; that is, they are not formed by a train of abstract reasoning, independent of facts and observa­tions. Criticism is an art founded wholly on experience; on the observation of such beau­ties as have come nearest to the standard which I before established: that is, of such beauties as have been found to please man­kind most generally. For example; Aris­totle rules concerning the unity of action in dramatic and epic composition, were not rules first discovered by logical reasoning, and then applied to poetry; but they were drawn from the practice of Homer and So­phocles: they were founded upon observing the superior pleasure which we receive from the relation of an action which is one and entire, beyond what we receive from the re­lation of scattered and unconnected facts. Such observations taking their rise at first from feeling and experience, were found on examination to be so consonant to reason, and to the principles of human nature, as to pass into established rules, and to be conve­niently applied for judging of the excellency of any performance. This is the most natu­ral account of the origin of Criticism."
"A MASTERLY genius, it is true, will of himself, untaught, compose in such a manner as shall be agreeable to the most material rules of Criticism; for as these rules are founded in nature, nature will often suggest  them in practice. Homer, it is more than probable, was acquainted with no systems of the art of poetry. Guided by genius alone, he composed in verse a regular story, which all posterity has admired. But this is no argument against the usefulness of Criti­cism as an art. For as no human genius is perfect, there is no writer but may receive assistance from critical observations upon the beauties and faults of those who have gone before him. No observations or rules can indeed supply the defect of genius, or in­spire it where it is wanting. But they may often direct it into its proper channell; they may correct its extravagancies, and point out to it the most just and proper imitation of nature. Critical rules are designed chiefly to shew the faults that ought to be avoided. To nature we must be indebted for the pro­duction of eminent beauties."
"FROM what has been said, we are enabled to form a judgment concerning those com­plaints which it has long been fashionable for petty authors to make against Critics and Criticism. Critics have been represented as the great abridgers of the native liberty of genius; as the imposers of unnatural shackles and bonds upon writers, from whose cruel persecution they must fly to the Public, and implore its protection. Such supplicatory prefaces are not calculated to give very fa­vourable ideas of the genius of the author. For every good writer will be pleased to have  his work examined by the principles of sound understanding, and true Taste. The decla­mations against Criticism commonly proceed upon this supposition, that Critics are such as judge by rule, not by feeling; which is so far from being true, that they who judge after this manner are pedants, not Critics. For all the rules of genuine Criticism I have shewn to be ultimately founded on feeling; and Taste and Feeling are necessary to guide us in the application of these rules to every particular instance. As there is nothing in which all sorts of persons more readily affect to be judges than in works of Taste, there is no doubt that the number of incompetent Critics will always be great. But this affords no more foundation for a general invective against Criticism, than the number of bad philosophers or reasoners affords against rea­son and philosophy."
"AN objection more plausible may be form against Criticism, from the applause that some performances have received from the Public, which, when accurately considered, are found to contradict the rules established by Criticism. Now, according to the princi­ples laid down in the last Lecture, the Public is the supreme judge to whom the last appeal must be made in every work of Taste; as the standard of Taste is founded on the senti­ments that are natural and common to all men. But with respect to this we are to ob­serve, that the sense of the Public is often  too hastily judged of. The genuine public Taste does not always appear in the first ap­plause given upon the publication of any new work. There are both a great vulgar and a small, apt to be catched and dazzled by very superficial beauties, the admiration of which in a little time passes away: and sometimes a writer may acquire great tem­porary reputation merely by his compliance with the passions or prejudices, with the party-spirit or superstitious notions, that may chance to rule for a time almost a whole nation. In such cases, though the Public may seem to praise, true Criticism may with reason condemn; and it will in progress of time gain the ascendant: for the judgment of true Criticism, and the voice of the Pub­lic, when once become unprejudiced and dis­passionate, will ever coincide at last."
"INSTANCES, I admit, there are, of some works that contain gross transgressions of the laws of Criticism, acquiring, nevertheless, a general, and even a lasting admiration. Such are the plays of Shakespeare, which, con­sidered as dramatic poems, are irregular in the highest degree. But then we are to re­mark, that they have gained the public miration, not by their being irregular, not by their transgressions of the rules of art, but in spite of such transgressions. They possess other beauties which are conformable to just rules; and the force of these beau­ties has been so great as to overpower all cen­sure,  and to give the Public a degree of sa­tisfaction superior to the disgust arising from their blemishes. Shakespeare pleases, not by his bringing the transactions of many years into one play; not by his grotesque mixtures of Tragedy and Comedy in one piece, nor by the strained thoughts, and affected witti­cisms, which he sometimes employs. These we consider as blemishes, and impute them to the grossness of the age in which he lived. But he pleases by his animated and masterly representations of characters, by the liveli­ness of his descriptions, the force of his sen­timents, and his possessing, beyond all wri­ters, the natural language of passion: Beau­ties which true Criticism no less teaches us to place in the highest rank, than nature teaches us to feel. ”This much it may suffice to have said concerning the origin, office, and im­portance of Criticism."
"I PROCEED next to explain the meaning of another term, which there will be fre­quent occasion to employ in these Lectures; that is, Genius."
"TASTE and Genius are two words fre­quently joined together; and therefore, by innaccurate thinkers, confounded. They signify however two quite different things. The difference between them can be clearly pointed out; and it is of importance to re­member it. Taste consists in the power of judging: Genius, in the power of executing.  One may have a considerable degree of Taste in Poetry, Eloquence, or any of the fine arts, who has little or hardly any Genius for com­position or execution in any of these arts: But Genius cannot be found without includ Taste also. Genius, therefore, deserves to be considered as a higher power of the mind than Taste. Genius always imports something inventive or creative; which does not rest in mere sensibility to beauty where it is perceived, but which can, moreover, produce new beauties, and exhibit them in such a manner as strongly to impress the minds of others. Refined Taste forms a good critic; but Genius is farther necessary to form the poet, or the orator."
"IT is proper also to observe, that Genius is a word, which, in common acceptation, extends much farther than to the objects of Taste. It is used to signify that talent or ap­titude which we receive from nature, for ex­celling in any one thing whatever. Thus we speak of a Genius for mathematics, as well as a Genius for poetry; of a Genius for war, for politics, or for any mechanical employment."
"THIS talent or aptitude for excelling in some one particular, is, I have said, what we receive from nature. By art and study, no doubt, it may be greatly improved; but by them alone it cannot be acquired. As Ge­nius is a higher faculty than Taste, it is ever,  according to the usual frugality of nature, more limited in the sphere of its operations. It is not uncommon to meet with persons who have an excellent Taste in several of the po­lite arts, such as music, poetry, painting, and eloquence, altogether: But, to find one who is an excellent performer in all these arts, is much more rare; or rather, indeed, such an one is not to be looked for. A fort of Uni­versal Genius, or one who is equally and in­differently turned towards several different professions and arts, is not likely to excel in any. Although there may be some few ex­ceptions, yet in general it holds, that when the bent of the mind is wholly directed to­wards some one object, exclusive, in a man­ner, of others, there is the fairest prospect of eminence in that, whatever it be. The rays must converge to a point, in order to glow intensely. This remark I here chuse to make, on account of its great importance to young people; in leading them to examine with care, and to pursue with ardour, the current and pointing of nature towards those exer­tions of Genius in which they are most likely to excel."
"A GENIUS for any of the fine arts, as I before observed, always supposes Taste; and it is clear, that the improvement of Taste will serve both to forward and to correct the ope­rations of Genius. In proportion as the Taste of a poet, or orator, becomes more refined with respect to the beauties of composition,  it will certainly assist him to produce the more finished beauties in his work. Genius, how­ever, in a Poet or Orator, may sometimes exist in a higher degree than Taste; that is, Genius may be bold and strong, when Taste is neither very delicate, nor very correct. This is often the case in the infancy of arts; a period, when Genius frequently exerts itself with great vigour, and executes with much warmth; while Taste, which requires expe­rience, and improves by slower degrees, hath not yet attained its full growth. Homer and Shakespear are proofs of what I now assert; in whose admirable writings are found in­stances of rudeness and indelicacy, which the more refined Taste of later writers, who had far inferior Genius to them, would have taught them to avoid. As all human perfec is limited, this may very probably be the law of our nature, that it is not given to one man to execute with vigour and fire, and, at the same time, to attend to all the lesser and more refined graces that belong to the exact perfection of his work: While, on the other hand, a thorough Taste for those inferior graces, is, for the most part, accompanied with a diminution of sublimity and force."
"HAVING thus explained the nature of Taste, the nature and importance of Criti­cism, and the distinction between Taste and Genius; I am now to enter on considering the sources of the Pleasures of Taste. Here opens a very extensive field; no less than all  the pleasures of the imagination, as they are commonly called, whether afforded us by na­tural objects, or by the imitations and scriptions of them. But it is not necessary to the purpose of my Lectures, that all these should be examined fully; the pleasure which we receive from discourse, or writing, being the main object of them. All that I purpose is, to give some openings into the Pleasures of Taste in general; and to insist, more par­ticularly, upon Sublimity and Beauty."
"WE are far from having yet attained to any system concerning this subject. Mr. dison was the first who attempted a regular enquiry, in his Essay on the Pleasures of the Imagination, published in the sixth volume of the Spectator. He has reduced these Plea­sures under three heads; Beauty, Grandeur, and Novelty. His speculations on this sub­ject, if not exceedingly profound, are, how­ever, very beautiful and entertaining; and he has the merit of having opened a tract, which was before unbeaten. The advances made since his time in this curious part of philosophical Criticism, are not very consi­derable; though some ingenious writers have pursued the subject. This is owing, doubt­less, to that thinness and subtility which are found to be properties of all the feelings of Taste. They are engaging objects; but when we would lay firm hold of them, and subject them to a regular discussion, they are always ready to elude our grasp. It is difficult to  make a full enumeration of the several ob­jects that give pleasure to Taste; it is more difficult to define all those which have been discovered, and to reduce them under proper classes; and, when we would go farther, and investigate the efficient causes of the pleasure which we receive from such objects, here, above all, we find ourselves at a loss. For instance; we all learn by experience, that certain figures of bodies appear to us more beautiful than others. On enquiring farther, we find that the regularity of some figures, and the graceful variety of others, are the foundation of the beauty which we discern in them; but when we attempt to go a step beyond this, and enquire what is the cause of regularity and variety producing in our minds the sensation of Beauty, any reason we can assign is extremely imperfect. Those first principles of internal sensation, nature seems to have covered with an impenetrable veil."
"IT is some comfort, however, that although the efficient cause be obscure, the final cause of those sensations lies in many cases more open: And, in entering on this subject, we cannot avoid taking notice of the strong im­pression which the powers of Taste and Ima­gination are calculated to give us of the be­nignity of our Creator. By endowing us with such powers, he hath widely enlarged the sphere of the pleasures of human life; and those, too, of a kind the most pure and  innocent. The necessary purposes of life might have been abundantly answered, though our senses of seeing and hearing had only served to distinguish external objects, without conveying to us any of those refined and licate sensations of Beauty and Grandeur, with which we are now so much delighted. This additional embellishment and glory, which, for promoting our entertainment, the Author of nature hath poured forth upon his works, is one striking testimony, among many others, of benevolence and goodness. This thought, which Mr. Addison first start  Dr. Akenside, in his Poem on the Plea­sures of the Imagination, has happily pur­sued."
" ”Not content"
"With every food of life to nourish man,"
"By kind illusions of the wondering sense,"
"Thou mak'st all nature, Beauty to his eye,"
"Or Music to his ear. ”"
"I SHALL begin with considering the Plea­sure which arises from Sublimity or Gran­deur, of which I propose to treat at some length; both, as this has a character more precise and distinctly marked, than any other, of the Pleasures of the Imagination, and as it coincides more directly with our main subject. For the greater distinctness I shall, first, treat of the Grandeur or Sublimity of external objects themselves, which will em­ploy the rest of this Lecture; and, after­wards,  of the description of such objects, or, of what is called the Sublime in Writing, which shall be the subject of a following Lec­ture. I distinguish these two things from one another, the Grandeur of the objects them­selves when they are presented to the eye, and the description of that Grandeur in dis­course or writing; though most Critics, inac­curately I think, blend them together; and I consider Grandeur and Sublimity as terms synonymous, or nearly so. If there be any distinction between them, it arises from Su­blimity expressing Grandeur in its highest degree*."
"IT is not easy to describe, in words, the precise impression which great and sublime objects make upon us, when we behold them; but every one has a conception of it. It consists in a kind of admiration and expan­sion of the mind; it raises the mind much above its ordinary state; and fills it with a degree of wonder and astonishment, which it cannot well express. The emotion is cer­tainly delightful; but it is altogether of the serious kind: a degree of awfulness and so­lemnity, even approaching to severity, com­monly attends it when at its height; very distinguishable from the more gay and brisk emotion raised by beautiful objects."
" THE simplest form of external Grandeur appears in the vast and boundless prospects presented to us by nature; such as wide ex­tended plains, to which the eye can see no limits; the firmament of Heaven; or the boundless expanse of the Ocean. All vast­ness produces the impression of Sublimity. It is to be remarked, however, that space, extended in length, makes not so strong an impression as height or depth. Though a boundless plain be a grand object, yet a high mountain, to which we look up, or an awful precipice or tower whence we look down on the objects which lie below, is still more so. The excessive Grandeur of the firmament arises from its height, joined to its boundless extent; and that of the ocean, not from its extent alone, but from the perpetual motion and irresistible force of that mass of waters. Wherever space is concerned, it is clear, that amplitude or greatness of extent, in one di­mension or other, is necessary to Grandeur. Remove all bounds from any object, and you presently render it sublime. Hence infinite space, endless numbers, and eternal duration, fill the mind with great ideas."
"FROM this some have imagined, that vast­ness, or amplitude of extent, is the founda of all Sublimity. But I cannot be of this opinion, because many objects appear sublime which have no relation to space at all. Such, for instance, is great loudness of sound. The burst of thunder or of cannon,  the roaring of winds, the shouting of multi­tudes, the sound of vast cataracts of water, are all incontestibly grand objects. I heard the voice of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters, and of mighty thunderings, saying Allelujah. In general we may ob­serve, that great power and force exerted, always raise sublime ideas: and perhaps the most copious source of these is derived from this quarter. Hence the grandeur of earth­quakes and burning mountains; of great conflagrations; of the stormy ocean, and overflowing waters; of tempests of wind; of thunder and lightning; and of all the un­common violence of the elements. Nothing is more sublime than mighty power and strength. A stream that runs within its banks, is a beautiful object; but when it rushes down with the impetuosity and noise of a torrent, it presently becomes a sublime one. From lions, and other animals of strength, are drawn sublime comparisons in poets. A race horse is looked upon with pleasure; but it is the war-horse, whose neck is clothed with thunder, that carries grandeur in its idea. The engagement of two great armies, as it is the highest exertion of human might, combines a variety of sources of the Sublime; and has accordingly been always considered as one of the most striking and magnificent spectacles that can be either presented to the eye, or exhibited to the imagination in description."
" FOR the farther illustration of this subject, it is proper to remark, that all ideas of the solemn and awful kind, and even bordering on the terrible, tend greatly to assist the Su­blime; such as darkness, solitude, and silence. What are the scenes of nature that elevate the mind in the highest degree, and produce the sublime sensation? Not the gay land­scape, the flowery field, or the flourishing city; but the hoary mountain, and the solita­ry lake; the aged forest, and the torrent fall over the rock. Hence too, night-scenes are commonly the most sublime. The fir­mament when filled with stars, scattered in such vast numbers, and with such magnifi­cent profusion, strikes the imagination with a more awful grandeur, than when we view it enlightened by all the splendour of the Sun. The deep sound of a great bell, or the strik of a great clock, are at any time grand; but, when heard amid the silence and stillness of the night, they become doubly so. Dark­ness is very commonly applied for adding su­blimity to all our ideas of the Deity. He maketh darkness his pavilion; he dwelleth in the thick cloud. So Milton"
" ”How oft, amidst"
"Thick clouds and dark, does Heav'ns all-ruling Sire"

" Observe, with how much art Virgil has in­troduced all those ideas of silence, vacuity, and darkness, when he is going to introduce his Hero to the infernal regions, and to dis­close the secrets of the great deep."
"Dii quibus imperium est animarum, umbraeque silentes,"
"Et Chaos, et Phlegethon, loca nocte silentia latÃ¨,"
"Sit mihi fas audita loqui; sit numine vestro"
"Pandere res altÃ¢ terrÃ¢, & caligine mersas."
"Ibant obscuri, solÃ¢ sub nocte, per umbram,"
"Perque domos Ditis vacuos, et inania regna;"
"Quale per incertam lunam, sub luce maligna"

"These passages I quote at present, not so much as instances of Sublime Writing, though in themselves they truly are so, as to shew, by the effect of them, that the objects which they present to us, belong to the class of su­blime ones."
" OBSCURITY, we are farther to remark, is not unfavourable to the Sublime. Though it render the object indistinct, the impressi­on, however, may be great; for, as an inge­nious Author has well observed, it is one thing to make an idea clear, and another to make it affecting to the imagination; and the imagination may be strongly affected; and, in fact, often is so, by objects of which we have no clear conception. Thus we see, that almost all the descriptions given us of the appearances of supernatural Beings, car­ry some Sublimity, though the conceptions which they afford us be confused and indis­tinct. Their Sublimity arises from the ideas, which they always convey, of superior power and might, joined with an awful obscurity. We may see this fully exemplified in the fol­lowing noble passage of the book of Job. In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. Then a spirit pass before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: it stood still; but I could not discern the form thereof; an image was before mine eyes; there was silence; and I heard a voice ”Shall mortal man be more just than God*? (Job,  15.) No  ideas, it is plain, as are so sublime as those taken from the Supreme Being; the most un­known, but the greatest of all objects; the infinity of whose nature, and the eternity of whose duration, joined with the omnipotence of his power, though they surpass our con­ceptions, yet exalt them to the highest. In general, all objects that are greatly raised above us, or far removed from us, either in space or in time, are apt to strike us as great. Our viewing them, as through the mist of distance or antiquity, is favourable to the impressions of their Sublimity."
"AS obscurity, so disorder too, is very com­patible with grandeur; nay, frequently heightens it. Few things that are strictly regular, and methodical, appear sublime. We see the limits on every side; we feel ourselves confined; there is no room for the mind exerting any great effort. Exact pro­portion of parts, though it enters often into the beautiful, is much disregarded in the Sublime. A great mass of rocks, thrown together by the hand of nature with wild­ness and confusion, strike the mind with  more grandeur, than if they had been justed to each other with the most accurate symmetry."
"IN the feeble attempts, which human art can make towards producing grand objects (feeble, I mean, in comparison with the pow­ers of nature), greatness of dimensions al­ways constitutes a principal part. No pile of building can convey any idea of Sublimity, unless it be ample and lofty. There is, too, in architecture, what is called Greatness of manner; which seems chiefly to arise, from presenting the object to us in one full point of view; so that it shall make its impression whole, entire, and undivided, upon the mind. A Gothic cathedral raises ideas of grandeur in our minds, by its size, its height, its aw­ful obscurity, its strength, its antiquity, and its durability."
"THERE still remains to be mentioned one class of Sublime objects; what may be called the moral, or sentimental Sublime; arising from certain exertions of the human mind; from certain affections, and actions, of our fellow-creatures. These will be found to be all, or chiefly, of that class, which comes under the name of Magnanimity or Hero­ism; and they produce an effect extremely similar to what is produced by the view of grand objects in nature; filling the mind with admiration, and elevating it above it­self. A noted instance of this, quoted by  all the French Critics, is the celebrated Qu'il Mourut of Corneille, in the Tragedy of Ho­race. In the famous combat between the Horatii and the Curiatii, the old Horatius, being informed, that two of his sons are slain, and that the third had betaken himself to flight, at first will not believe the report; but being thoroughly assured of the fact, is fired with all the sentiments of high honour and indignation at this supposed unworthy behaviour of his surviving son. He is re­minded, that his son stood alone against three, and asked what he would have had him to have done? ”To have died, ”he answers. In the same manner Porus, taken prisoner by Alexander, after a gallant defence, and asked in what manner he would be treated? answering, Like a king; and Caesar chid the pilot who was afraid to set out with him in a storm, Quid times? Caesarem ve­his; are good instances of this sentimen­tal sublime. Wherever, in some critical and high situation, we behold a man uncommon­ly intrepid, and resting upon himself; supe­rior to passion and to fear; animated by some great principle to the contempt of popular opinion, of selfish interest, of dangers, or of death; there we are struck with a sense of the Sublime*."
" HIGH virtue is the most natural and fer­tile source of this moral Sublimity. How­ever, on some occasions, where Virtue either has no place, or is but imperfectly displayed, yet if extraordinary vigour and force of mind be discovered, we are not insensible to a gree of grandeur in the character; and from the splendid conqueror, or the daring conspi­rator, whom we are far from approving, we cannot with-hold our admiration*."
" I HAVE now enumerated a variety of in­stances, both in inanimate objects and in hu­man life, wherein the Sublime appears. In all these instances, the emotion raised in us is of the same kind, although the objects that produce the emotion be of widely different kinds. A question next arises, whether we are able to discover some one fundamental quality in which all these different objects agree, and which is the cause of their pro­ducing an emotion of the same nature in our minds? Various hypotheses have been formed concerning this; but, as far as appears to me, hitherto unsatisfactory. Some have imagined that amplitude, or great extent, joined with simplicity, is either immediately, or remotely, the fundamental quality of what­ever is sublime; but we have seen that am­plitude is confined to one species of Sublime Objects; and cannot, without violent strain  be applied to them all. The Author of a Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, to whom we are indebted for several inge­nious and original thoughts upon this subject, proposes a formal theory upon this founda  That terror is the source of the Su­blime, and that no objects have this charac­ter, but such as produce impressions of pain  and danger. It is indeed true, that many terrible objects are highly sublime; and that grandeur does not refuse an alliance with the idea of danger. But though this is very pro­perly illustrated by the Author (many of whose sentiments on that head I have adopt , yet he seems to stretch his theory too far, when he represents the Sublime as con­sisting wholly in modes of danger, or of pain. For the proper sensation of Sublimity, ap­pears to be very distinguishable from the sen­sation of either of those; and, on several oc­casions, to be entirely separated from them. In many grand objects, there is no coincid­ence with terror at all; as in the magnificent prospect of wide extended plains, and of the starry firmament; or in the moral dispositi­ons and sentiments, which we view with high admiration; and in many painful and terrible objects also, it is clear, there is no sort of grandeur. The amputation of a limb, or the bite of a snake, are exceedingly terrible; but are destitute of all claim what­ever to Sublimity. I am inclined to think, that mighty force or power, whether accom­panied with terror or not, whether employed in protecting, or in alarming us, has a bet­ter title, than any thing that has yet been mentioned, to be the fundamental quality of the Sublime; as, after the review which we have taken, there does not occur to me any Sublime Object, into the idea of which, power, strength, and force, either enter not directly, or are not, at least, intimately asso­ciated  with the idea, by leading our thoughts to some astonishing power, as concerned in the production of the object. However, I do not insist upon this as sufficient to found a general theory: It is enough, now, to have given this view of the nature and different kinds of Sublime Objects; by which I hope to have laid a proper foundation for discus­sing, with greater accuracy, the Sublime in Writing and Composition."
"LECTURE  THE SUBLIME IN WRITING."
"HAVING treated of Grandeur or Subli­mity in external objects, the way seems now to be cleared, for treating, with more advantage, of the description of such ob­jects; or, of what is called the Sublime in Writing. Though it may appear early to enter on the consideration of this subject; yet, as the Sublime is a species of Writing which depends less than any other on the ar­tificial embellishments of rhetoric, it may be examined with as much propriety here, as in any subsequent part of the Lectures."
"MANY critical terms have unfortunately been employed, in a sense too loose and vague; none more so, than that of the Su­blime. Every one is acquainted with the character of Caesar Commentaries, and of the style in which they are written; a style remarkably pure, simple, and elegant; but  the most remote from the Sublime, of any of the classical authors. Yet this author has a German critic, Johannes Gulielmus Ber­gerus, who wrote no longer ago than the year 1720, pitched upon as the perfect model of the Sublime, and has composed a quarto volume, entitled, naturali pulchritudine Orationis; the express intention of which, is to shew, that Caesar Commentaries con­tain the most complete exemplification of all Longinus rules relating to Sublime Writing. This I mention as a strong proof of the con­fused ideas which have prevailed, concern this subject. The true sense of Sublime Writing, undoubtedly, is such a description of objects, or exhibition of sentiments, which are in themselves of a Sublime nature, as shall give us strong impressions of them. But there is another very indefinite, and there­fore very improper, sense, which has been too often put upon it; when it is applied to fignify any remarkable and distinguishing ex­cellency of composition; whether it raise in us the ideas of grandeur, or those of gentle­ness, elegance, or any other sort of beauty. In this sense, Caesar Commentaries may, in­deed, be termed Sublime, and so may many Sonnets, Pastorals, and Love Elegies, as well as Homer Iliad. But this evidently con­founds the use of words; and marks no one species, or character, of composition what­ever."
" I AM sorry to be obliged to observe, that the Sublime is too often used in this last and improper sense, by the celebrated critic Lon­ginus, in his treatise on this subject. He sets out, indeed, with describing it in its just and proper meaning; as something that elevates the mind above itself, and fills it with high conceptions, and a noble pride. But from this view of it he frequently departs; and substitutes in the place of it, whatever, in any strain of composition, pleases highly. Thus, many of the passages which he pro­duces as instances of the Sublime, are mere­ly elegant, without having the most distant relation to proper Sublimity; witness Sap­pho famous Ode, on which he descants at considerable length. He points out five sources of the Sublime. The first is, Bold­ness or Grandeur in the Thoughts; the se­cond is, the Pathetic; the third, the proper application of Figures; the fourth, the use of Tropes and beautiful Expressions; the fifth, Musical Structure and Arrangement of Words. This is the plan of one who was writing a treatise of rhetoric, or of the beau­ties of Writing in general; not of the Su­blime in particular. For of these five heads, only the two first have any peculiar relation to the Sublime; Boldness and Grandeur in the Thoughts, and, in some instances, the Pathetic, or strong exertions of Passion: The other three, Tropes, Figures, and Musical Arrangement, have no more relation to the Sublime, than to other kinds of good Writ   perhaps less to the Sublime than to any other species whatever; because it requires less the assistance of ornament. From this it appears, that clear and precise ideas on this head are not to be expected from that writer. I would not, however, be under­stood, as if I meant, by this censure, to re­present his treatise as of small value. I know no critic, ancient or modern, that discovers a more lively relish of the beauties of fine writing, than Longinus; and he has also the merit of being himself an excellent, and, in several passages, a truly Sublime, writer. But, as his work has been generally consider as a standard on this subject, it was in­cumbent on me to give my opinion concern the benefit to be derived from it. It serves to be consulted, not so much for dis­tinct instruction concerning the Sublime, as for excellent general ideas concerning beauty in writing."
"I RETURN now to the proper and natural idea of the Sublime in composition. The foundation of it must always be laid in the nature of the object described. Unless it be such an object as, if presented to our eyes, if exhibited to us in reality, would raise ideas of that elevating, that awful, and magnifi­cent kind, which we call Sublime; the scription, however finely drawn, is not en­titled to come under this class. This ex­cludes all objects that are merely beautiful, gay, or elegant. In the next place, the ob­ject  must not only, in itself, be Sublime, but it must be set before us in such a light as is most proper to give us a clear and full im­pression of it; it must be described with strength, with conciseness, and simplicity. This depends, principally, upon the lively impression which the poet, or orator has of the object which he exhibits; and upon his being deeply affected, and warmed, by the Sublime idea which he would convey. If his own feeling be languid, he can never in­spire us with any strong emotion. Instances, which are extremely necessary on this sub­ject, will clearly show the importance of all those requisites which I have just now men­tioned."
"IT is, generally speaking, among the most ancient authors, that we are to look for the most striking instances of the Sublime, I am inclined to think, that the early ages of the world, and the rude unimproved state of so­ciety, are peculiarly favourable to the strong emotions of Sublimity. The genius of men is then much turned to admiration and asto­nishment. Meeting with many objects, to them new and strange, their imagination is kept glowing, and their passions are often raised to the utmost. They think, and ex­press themselves boldly, and without re­straint. In the progress of society, the ge­nius and manners of men undergo a change more favourable to accuracy, than to strength or Sublimity."
" OF all writings, ancient or modern, the Sacred Scriptures afford us the highest in­stances of the Sublime. The descriptions of the Deity, in them, are wonderfully noble; both from the grandeur of the object, and the manner of representing it. What an as­semblage, for instance, of awful and sublime ideas is presented to us, in that passage of the XVIIIth Psalm, where an appearance of the Almighty is described? In my distress I called upon the Lord; he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him. Then, the earth shook and trem­bled; the foundations also of the hills were moved; because he was wroth. He bow the heavens, and came down, and dark­ness was under his feet; and he did ride upon a Cherub, and did fly; yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind. He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters, and thick clouds of the sky. Here, agreea­bly to the principles established in the last Lecture, we see, with what propriety and success the circumstances of darkness and terror are applied for heightening the Su­blime. So, also, the prophet Habakkuk, in a similar passage: He stood, and measured the earth; he beheld, and drove asunder the nations. The everlasting mountains were scattered; the perpetual hills did bow; his ways are everlasting. The moun­tains saw thee; and they trembled. The overflowing of the water passed by. The  deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high."
"THE noted instance, given by Longinus, from Moses, God said, let there be light; and there was light, is not liable to the censure which I passed on some of his in­stances, of being foreign to the subject. It belongs to the true Sublime; and the Su­blimity of it arises from the strong concep it gives, of an exertion of power, pro­ducing its effect with the utmost speed and facility. A thought of the same kind is magnificently amplified in the following pas­sage of Isaiah   xxiv. 24. 27. 28.): Thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb: I am the Lord that maketh all things, that stretcheth forth the heavens alone, that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself ”that saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers; that saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure; even, saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the Temple, Thy foundation shall be laid. There is a passage in the Psalms, which deserves to be mentioned un­der this head; God, says the Psalmist, stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumults of the peo­ple. The joining together two such grand objects, as the ragings of the waters, and the tumults of the people, between which there is so much resemblance as to form a very na­tural  association in the fancy, and the repre­senting them both as subject, at one mo­ment, to the command of God, produces a noble effect."
"HOMER is a poet, who, in all ages, and by all critics, has been greatly admired for Sublimity; and he owes much of his gran­deur to that native and unaffected simplicity which characterises his manner. His descrip­tions of hosts engaging; the animation, the fire, and rapidity, which he throws into his battles, present to every reader of the Iliad, frequent instances of Sublime Writing. His introduction of the Gods, tends often to heighten, in a high degree, the majesty of his warlike scenes. Hence Longinus bestows such high and just commendations on that passage, in the XVth book of the Iliad, where Neptune, when preparing to issue forth into the engagement, is described as shaking the mountains with his steps, and driving his chariot along the ocean. Minerva, arming herself for fight in the Vth book; and Apol­lo, in the XVth, leading on the Trojans, and flashing terror with his Aegis on the face of the Greeks, are similar instances of great Sublimity added to the description of battles, by the appearances of those celestial beings. In the XXth book, where all the Gods take part in the engagement, according as they severally favour either the Grecians, or the Trojans, the poet seems to put forth one of his highest efforts, and the description rises  into the most awful magnificence. All na­ture is represented as in commotion. Jupiter thunders in the heavens; Neptune strikes the earth with his Trident; the ships, the city, and the mountains shake; the earth trembles to its centre; Pluto starts from his throne, in dread lest the secrets of the infer­nal region should be laid open to the view of mortals. The passage is worthy of be inserted."

"Iliad, 20. 47.  "
" THE works of Ossian (as I have elsewhere shewn) abound with examples of the Su­blime. The subjects of that Author, and the manner in which he writes, are particu­larly favourable to it. He possesses all the plain and venerable manner of the ancient times. He deals in no superfluous or gaudy ornaments; but throws forth his images with a rapid conciseness, which enable them to strike the mind with the greatest force. Among poets of more polished times, we are to look for the graces of correct writing, for just proportion of parts, and skilfully con­ducted narration. In the midst of smiling scenery and pleasurable themes, the gay and the beautiful will appear, undoubtedly, to more advantage. But amidst the rude scenes of nature and of society, such as Ossian scribes; amidst rocks, and torrents, and whirlwinds, and battles, dwells the Sublime; and naturally associates itself with that grave  and solemn spirit which distinguishes the Au­thor of Fingal. As autumn dark storms pour from two echoing hills, so toward each other approached the heroes. As two dark streams from high rocks meet and mix, and roar on the plain; loud, rough, and dark, in battle, met Lochlin and Inisfail: chief mixed his strokes with chief, and man with man. Steel clanging sounded on steel. Helmets are cleft on high; blood bursts, and smokes around. As the troubled noise of the ocean when roll the waves on high; as the last peal of the thunder of heaven; such is the noise of battle. The groan of the people spread over the hills. It was like the thunder of night, when the cloud bursts on Cona, and a thousand ghosts shriek at once on the hollow wind. Ne­ver were images of more awful Sublimity em­ployed to heighten the terror of battle."
"I HAVE produced these instances, in order to demonstrate how essential conciseness and simplicity are to Sublime Writing. Simpli­city, I place in opposition to studied and pro­fuse ornament; and conciseness, to super­fluous expression. The reason why a defect, either in conciseness or simplicity, is hurtful in a peculiar manner to the Sublime, I shall endeavour to explain. The emotion occasi­oned in the mind by some great or noble ob­ject, raises it considerably above its ordinary pitch. A sort of enthusiasm is produced, extremely agreeable while it lasts; but from  which the mind is tending every moment to fall down into its ordinary situation. Now, when an author has brought us, or is at­tempting to bring us, into this state; if he multiplies words unnecessarily, if he decks the Sublime object which he presents to us, round and round, with glittering ornaments; nay, if he throws in any one decoration that sinks in the least below the capital image, that moment he alters the key; he relaxes the tension of the mind; the strength of the feeling is emasculated; the Beautiful may remain, but the Sublime is gone. ”When Ju­lius Caesar said to the Pilot who was afraid to put to sea with him in a storm, Quid times? Caesarem vehis; we are struck with the daring magnanimity of one relying with such confidence on his cause and his fortune. These few words convey every thing neces­sary to give us the impression full. Lucan resolved to amplify and adorn the thought. Observe how every time he twists it round, it departs farther from the Sublime, till it end at last in tumid declamation."
"Sperne minas, inquit, pelagi, ventoque furenti"
"Trade sinum: Italiam, si, coelo auctore, recusas,"
"Me, pete. Sola tibi causa haec est justa timoris"
"Victorem non nosse tuum; quem numina nunquam"
"Destituunt; quo male tunc Fortuna meretur"
"Cum post vota venit. Medias perrumpe procellas"
"TutelÃ¢ secure meÃ¢. Coeli isti fretique"
"Non puppis nostrae labor est. Hanc Caesare pressam"
"A fluctu defendet onus; nam proderit undis"
"Iste ratis. ”Quid tanta strage paratur"
" Ignoras? quaerit pelagi coelique tumultu"
"Quid praestet fortuna mihi*. ”"
"PHARS.  578."
"ON account of the great importance of simplicity and conciseness, I conceive rhyme, in English verse, to be, if not inconsistent with the Sublime, at least very unfavourable to it. The constrained elegance of this kind of verse, and studied smoothness of the sounds, answering regularly to each other at the end of the line, though they be quite consistent with gentle emotions, yet weaken the native force of Sublimity; besides, that the superfluous words which the poet is often obliged to introduce, in order to fill up the  rhyme, tend farther to enfeeble it. Homer description of the nod of Jupiter, as shaking the heavens, has been admired, in all ages, as highly Sublime. Literally translated, it runs thus: He spoke, and bending his sa­ble brows, gave the awful nod; while he shook the celestial locks of his immortal head, all Olympus was shaken. Mr. Pope translates it thus:"
"He spoke; and awful bends his sable brows,"
"Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,"
"The stamp of fate, and sanction of a God."
"High Heaven with trembling the dread signal took,"
"And all Olympus to its centre shook."
"THE image is spread out, and attempted to be beautified; but it is, in truth, weak­ened. The third line ”The stamp of fate, and sanction of a God, is merely exple­tive; and introduced for no other reason but to fill up the rhyme; for it interrupts the scription, and clogs the image. For the same reason, out of mere compliance with the rhyme, Jupiter is represented as shaking his locks before he gives the nod, ”Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod, which is trifling, and without meaning. Whereas, in the original, the hair of his head shaken, is the effect of his nod, and makes a happy picturesque circumstance in the descrip .

 THE boldness, freedom, and variety of our blank verse, is infinitely more favoura­ble than rhyme, to all kinds of Sublime poe­try. The fullest proof of this is afforded by Milton; an author, whose genius led him eminently to the Sublime. The whole first and second books of Paradise Lost, are con­tinued instances of it. Take only, for an example, the following noted description of Satan, after his fall, appearing at the head of the infernal hosts:
 ”He, above the rest,
In shape and gesture proudly eminent,
Stood like a tower: his form had not yet lost
All her original brightness, nor appeared
Less than archangel ruined; and the excess
Of glory obscured: As when the sun, new risen,
Looks through the horizontal misty air,
Shorn of his beams; or, from behind, the moon,
In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds
On half the nations, and with fear of change
Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone
Above them all  Archangel. ”

Here concur a variety of sources of the Su­blime: The principal object eminently great; a high superior nature, fallen indeed, but erecting itself against distress; the grandeur of the principal object heightened, by asso­ciating it with so noble an idea as that of the sun suffering an eclipse; this picture shaded with all those images of change and trouble, of darkness and terror, which coincide so finely with the Sublime emotion; and the  whole expressed in a style and versification, easy, natural, and simple, but magnificent.

I HAVE spoken of simplicity and concise­ness, as essential to Sublime Writing. In my general description of it, I mentioned Strength, as another necessary requisite. The Strength of description arises, in a great measure, from a simple conciseness; but, it supposes also something more; namely, a proper choice of circumstances in the description, so as to ex­hibit the object in its full and most striking point of view. For every object has several faces, so to speak, by which it may be presented to us, according to the circum­stances with which we surround it; and it will appear eminently Sublime, or not, in proportion as all these circumstances are hap­pily chosen, and of a Sublime kind. Here lies the great art of the writer; and indeed, the great difficulty of Sublime description. If the description be too general, and divest of circumstances, the object appears in a faint light; it makes a feeble impression, or no impression at all, on the reader. At the same time, if any trivial or improper circum­stances are mingled, the whole is degraded.

A STORM or tempest, for instance, is a Su­blime object in nature. But, to render it Sublime in description, it is not enough, ei­ther to give us mere general expressions con­cerning the violence of the tempest, or to describe its common, vulgar effects, in over­throwing  trees and houses. It must be paint with such circumstances as fill the mind with great and awful ideas. This is very happily done by Virgil, in the following passage:
Ipse Pater, media nimborum in nocte, coruscÃ¢
Fulmina molitur dextrÃ¢; quo maxima motu
Terra tremit; fugere ferae; & mortalia corda,
Per gentes humilis stravit pavor: Ille, flagranti
Aut Atho, aut Rhodopen, aut alta Ceraunia telo
Dejicit*. ”
GEORG. I.

EVERY circumstance in this noble descrip is the production of an imagination heated and astonished with the grandeur of the object. If there be any defect, it is in the words immediately following those I have quoted; Ingeminant Austri, et den­sissimus imber; where the transition is made too hastily, I am afraid, from the pre­ceding Sublime images, to a thick shower, and the blowing of the south wind; and  shews how difficult it frequently is, to descend with grace, without seeming to fall.

THE high importance of the rule which I have been now giving, concerning the pro­per choice of circumstances, when descrip is meant to be Sublime, seems to me not to have been sufficiently attended to. It has, however, such a foundation in nature, as ren­ders the least deflexion from it fatal. When a writer is aiming at the beautiful only, his descriptions may have improprieties in them, and yet be beautiful still. Some trivial, or misjudged circumstances, can be overlooked by the reader; they make only the difference of more or less; the gay, or pleasing emo  which he has raised, subsists still. But the case is quite different with the Sublime. There, one trifling circumstance, one mean idea, is sufficient to destroy the whole charm. This is owing to the nature of the emotion aimed at by Sublime description, which mits of no mediocrity, and cannot subsist in a middle state; but must either highly tran­sport us, or, if unsuccessful in the execution, leave us greatly disgusted, and displeased. We attempt to rise along with the writer; the imagination is awakened, and put upon the stretch; but it requires to be supported; and if, in the midst of its effort, you desert it unexpectedly, down it comes with a pain­ful shock. When Milton, in his battle of the angels, describes them as tearing up the mountains, and throwing them at one ano­ther;  there are, in his description, as Mr. dison has observed, no circumstances but what are properly Sublime:
From their foundations loos'ning to and fro,
They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,
Rocks, waters, woods; and by the shaggy tops
Uplifting, bore them in their hands. ”

Whereas Claudian, in a fragment upon the war of the giants, has contrived to render this idea of their throwing the mountains, which is in itself so grand, burlesque and ri­diculous; by this single circumstance, of one of his giants with the mountain Ida upon his shoulders, and a river, which flowed from the mountain, running down along the gi­ant back, as he held it up in that posture. There is a description too in Virgil, which, I think, is censurable, though more slightly, in this respect. It is that of the burning moun­tain Aetna; a subject certainly very proper to be worked up by a poet into a Sublime description:
 ”Horrificis juxta tonat Aetna ruinis.
Interdumque atram prorumpit aethera nubem,
Turbine fumantem piceo, & candente favilla;
Attollitque globos flammarum, & sidera lambit.
Interdum scopulos, avulsaque viscera montis
Erigit eructans, liquefactaque saxa sub auras
Cum gemitu glomerat, fundoque exaestuat imo*.
AEN. III. 571.

 Here, after several magnificent images, the Poet concludes with personifying the moun­tain under this figure, eructans viscera cum gemitu, belching up its bowels with a groan; which, by likening the mountain to a sick, or drunk person, degrades the ma­jesty of the description. It is to no purpose to tell us, that the Poet here alludes to the fable of the giant Enceladus lying under mount Aetna; and that he supposes his mo­tions and tossings to have occasioned the fiery eruptions. He intended the description of a Sublime object; and the natural ideas, raised by a burning mountain, are infinitely more lofty, than the belchings of any giant, how huge soever. The debasing effect of the idea which is here presented, will appear in a stronger light, by seeing what figure it makes in a poem of Sir Richard Blackmore  who, through a monstrous perversity of taste, had chosen this for the capital circumstance in his description, and thereby (as Dr. Arbuthnot humourously observes, in his Treatise on the Art of Sinking) had represented the moun­tain as in a fit of the cholic.

Aetna, and all the burning mountains find
Their kindled stores with inbred storms of wind
Blown up to rage, and roaring out complain,
As torn with inward gripes and torturing pain;
Labouring, they cast their dreadful vomit round,
And with their melted bowels spread the ground.

Such instances shew how much the Sublime depends upon a just selection of circum­stances; and with how great care every cir­cumstance must be avoided, which, by bor­dering in the least upon the mean, or even upon the gay or the trifling, alters the tone of the emotion.

IF it shall now be enquired, What are the proper sources of the Sublime? My answer is, That they are to be looked for every where in nature. It is not by hunting after tropes, and figures, and rhetorical assistances, that we can expect to produce it. No: it stands clear, for the most part, of these boured refinements of art. It must come unsought, if it come at all; and be the na­tural offspring of a strong imagination.
Est Deus in nobis; agitante calescimus illo.

Wherever a great and awful object is pre­sented in nature, or a very magnanimous and exalted affection of the human mind is displayed; thence, if you can catch the im­pression strongly, and exhibit it warm and glowing, you may draw the Sublime. These are its only proper sources. In judging of  any striking beauty in composition, whether it is, or is not, to be referred to this class, we must attend to the nature of the emotion which it raises; and only, if it be of that elevating, solemn, and awful kind, which distinguishes this feeling, we can pronounce it Sublime.

FROM the account which I have given of the nature of the Sublime, it clearly follows, that it is an emotion which can never be long protracted. The mind, by no force of genius, can be kept, for any considerable time, so far raised above its common tone; but will, of course, relax into its ordinary situation. Neither are the abilities of any human writer sufficient to supply a continued run of unmixed Sublime conceptions. The utmost we can expect is, that this fire of imagination should sometimes flash upon us like lightning from heaven, and then disap­pear. In Homer and Milton, this effulgence of genius breaks forth more frequently, and with greater lustre than in most authors. Shakespeare also rises often into the true Sublime. But no author whatever is Sublime throughout. Some, indeed, there are, who, by a strength and dignity in their concepti­ons, and a current of high ideas that runs through their whole composition, preserve the reader mind always in a tone nearly allied to the Sublime; for which reason they may, in a limited sense, merit the name of continued Sublime writers; and, in this  class, we may justly place Demosthenes and Plato.

As for what is called the Sublime style, it is, for the most part, a very bad one; and has no relation whatever to the real Sublime. Persons are apt to imagine, that magnificent words, accumulated epithets, and a certain swelling kind of expression, by rising above what is usual or vulgar, contributes to, or even forms, the Sublime. Nothing can be more false. In all the instances of Sublime Writing, which I have given, nothing of this kind appears. God said, Let there be light, and there was light. This is striking and Sublime. But put it into what is commonly called the Sublime style: The Sovereign Arbiter of nature, by the potent energy of a single word, commanded the light to ex­ist: and, as Boileau has well observed, the style indeed is raised, but the thought is fall­en. In general, in all good writing, the Su­blime lies in the thought, not in the words; and when the thought is truly noble, it will, for the most part, clothe itself in a native dig­nity of language. The Sublime, indeed, re­jects mean, low, or trivial expressions; but it is equally an enemy to such as are turgid. The main secret of being Sublime, is to say great things in few and plain words. It will be found to hold, without exception, that the most Sublime authors are the simplest in their style; and wherever you find a writer, who affects a more than ordinary pomp and parade  of words, and is always endeavouring to magnify his subject by epithets, there you may immediately suspect, that, feeble in sen­timent, he is studying to support himself by mere expression.

THE same unfavourable judgment we must pass, on all that laboured apparatus with which some writers introduce a passage, or description, which they intend shall be Su­blime; calling on their readers to attend, in­voking their Muse, or breaking forth into general, unmeaning exclamations, concern the greatness, terribleness, or majesty of the object, which they are to describe. Mr. Addison, in his Campaign, has fallen into an error of this kind, when about to describe the battle of Blenheim.
But  my Muse! what numbers wilt thou find
To sing the furious troops in battle joined?
Methinks, I hear the drum tumultuous sound,
The victor shouts, and dying groans, confound;  

Introductions of this kind, are a forced at­tempt in a writer, to spur up himself, and his reader, when he finds his imagination flagging in vigour. It is like taking artificial spirits in order to supply the want of such as are natural. By this observation, however, I do not mean to pass a general censure on Mr. Addison Campaign, which, in several places, is far from wanting merit; and in particular, the noted comparison of his hero  to the angel who rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm, is a truly Sublime image.

THE faults opposite to the Sublime are chiefly two; the Frigid, and the Bombast. The Frigid consists, in degrading an object, or sentiment, which is Sublime in itself, by our mean conception of it; or by our weak, low, and childish description of it. This betrays entire absence, or at least great po­verty of genius. Of this, there are abun­dance of examples, and these commented upon with much humour, in the Treatise on the Art of Sinking, in Dean Swift works; the instances taken chiefly from Sir Richard Blackmore. One of these, I had occasion already to give, in relation to mount Aetna, and it were needless to produce any more. The Bombast lies, in forcing an ordinary or trivial object out of its rank, and endeavour to raise it into the Sublime; or, in at­tempting to exalt a Sublime object beyond all natural and reasonable bounds. Into this error, which is but too common, writers of genius may sometimes fall, by unluckily los sight of the true point of the Sublime. This is also called Fustian, or Rant. Shakes­peare, a great, but incorrect genius, is not unexceptionable here. Dryden and Lee, in their tragedies, abound with it.

THUS far of the Sublime; of which I have treated fully, because it is so capital an excel­lency in fine writing, and because clear and  precise ideas on this head are, as far as I know, not to be met with in critical writers.

BEFORE concluding this Lecture, there is one observation which I chuse to make at this time; I shall make it once for all, and hope it will be afterwards remembered. It is with respect to the instances of faults, or ra­ther blemishes and imperfections, which, as I have done in this Lecture, I shall hereafter continue to take, when I can, from writers of reputation. I have not the least inten thereby to disparage their character in the general. I shall have other occasions of doing equal justice to their beauties. But it is no reflection on any human performance, that it is not absolutely perfect. The task would be much easier for me, to collect in­stances of faults from bad writers. But they would draw no attention, when quoted from books which nobody reads. And I conceive, that the method which I follow, will contri­bute more to make the best authors be read with pleasure, when one properly distin­guishes their beauties from their faults; and is led to imitate and admire only what is worthy of imitation and admiration.

LECTURE  BEAUTY, AND OTHER PLEASURES OF TASTE.

AS Sublimity constitutes a particular cha­racter of composition, and forms one of the highest excellencies of eloquence and of poetry, it was proper to treat of it at some length. It will not be necessary to discuss so particularly all the other pleasures that arise from Taste, as some of them have less relation to our main subject. On Beauty only I shall make several observations, both as the subject is curious, and as it tends to improve Taste, and to discover the founda of several of the graces of description and of poetry*.

 BEAUTY, next to Sublimity, affords, be­yond doubt, the highest pleasure to the ima­gination. The emotion which it raises, is very distinguishable from that of Sublimity. It is of a calmer kind; more gentle and sooth  does not elevate the mind so much, but produces an agreeable serenity. Sublimity raises a feeling, too violent, as I showed, to be lasting; the pleasure arising from Beauty admits of longer continuance. It extends also to a much greater variety of objects than Sublimity; to a variety indeed so great, that the feelings which Beautiful objects pro­duce, differ considerably, not in degree only, but also in kind, from one another. Hence, no word in the language is used in a more vague signification than Beauty. It is ap­plied to almost every external object that pleases the eye, or the ear; to a great num­ber of the graces of writing; to many dis­positions of the mind; nay, to several ob­jects of mere abstract science. We talk cur­rently of a beautiful tree or flower; a beau­tiful poem; a beautiful character; and a beautiful theorem in mathematics.

HENCE we may easily perceive, that, among so great a variety of objects, to find out some one quality in which they all agree, and which is the foundation of that agreea­ble sensation they all raise, must be a very difficult, if not, more probably, a vain at­tempt. Objects, denominated Beautiful, are so different, as to please, not in virtue of any  one quality common to them all, but by means of several different principles in hu­man nature. The agreeable emotion which they all raise, is somewhat of the same na­ture; and therefore, has the common name of Beauty given to it; but it is raised by dif­ferent causes.

HYPOTHESES, however, have been framed by ingenious men, for assigning the funda­mental quality of Beauty in all objects. In particular, Uniformity amidst Variety, has been insisted on as this fundamental quality. For the Beauty of many figures, I admit that this accounts in a satisfying manner. But when we endeavour to apply this prin­ciple to Beautiful objects of some other kind, as to Colour for instance, or Motion, we shall soon find that it has no place. And even in external figured objects, it does not hold, that their Beauty is in proportion to their mixture of Variety with Uniformity; seeing many please us as highly beautiful, which have al­most no variety at all; and others, which are various to a degree of intricacy. Laying systems of this kind, therefore, aside, what I now propose is, to give an enumeration of several of those classes of objects in which Beauty most remarkably appears; and to point out, as far as I can, the separate prin­ciples of Beauty in each of them.

COLOUR affords, perhaps, the simplest in­stance of Beauty, and therefore the fittest to  begin with. Here, neither Variety, nor niformity, nor any other principle that I know, can be assigned, as the foundation of Beauty. We can refer it to no other cause but the structure of the eye, which deter­mines us to receive certain modifications of the rays of light with more pleasure than others. And we see accordingly, that, as the organ of sensation varies in different per­sons, they have their different favourite co­lours. It is probable, that association of ideas has influence, in some cases, on the pleasure which we receive from colours. Green, for instance, may appear more beau­tiful, by being connected in our ideas with rural prospects and scenes; white, with in­nocence; blue, with the serenity of the sky. Independent of associations of this kind, all that we can farther observe concerning co­lours is, that those chosen for Beauty are, generally, delicate, rather than glaring. Such are those paintings with which nature hath ornamented some of her works, and which art strives in vain to imitate; as the feathers of several kinds of birds, the leaves of flow­ers, and the fine variation of colours exhi­bited by the sky at the rising and setting of the sun. These present to us the highest in­stances of the Beauty of colouring; and have accordingly been the favourite subjects of poetical description in all countries.

FROM Colour we proceed to Figure, which opens to us forms of Beauty more complex  and diversified. Regularity first occurs to be noticed as a source of Beauty. By a regular figure, is meant, one which we perceive to be formed according to some certain rule, and not left arbitrary, or loose, in the construc of its parts. Thus, a circle, a square, a triangle, or a hexagon, please the eye, by their regularity, as beautiful figures. We must not, however, conclude, that all figures please in proportion to their regularity; or that regularity is the sole, or the chief, foun­dation of Beauty in figure. On the contra­ry, a certain graceful variety is found to be a much more powerful principle of Beauty; and is therefore studied a great deal more than regularity, in all works that are designed merely to please the eye. I am, indeed, in­clined to think, that regularity appears beau­tiful to us, chiefly, if not only, on account of its suggesting the ideas of fitness, propri­ety, and use, which have always a greater connection with orderly and proportioned forms, than with those which appear not constructed according to any certain rule. It is clear, that nature, who is undoubtedly the most graceful artist, hath, in all her orna­mental works, pursued variety, with an ap­parent neglect of regularity. Cabinets, doors, and windows, are made after a regular form, in cubes and parallelograms, with exact pro­portion of parts; and by being so formed they please the eye; for this good reason, that, being works of use, they are, by such figures, the better suited to the ends for which they  were designed. But plants, flowers, and leaves are full of variety and diversity. A straight canal is an insipid figure, in compa­rison of the maeanders of rivers. Cones and pyramids are beautiful; but trees growing in their natural wildness, are infinitely more beautiful than when trimmed into pyramids and cones. The apartments of a house must be regular in their disposition, for the conve­niency of its inhabitants; but a garden, which is designed merely for Beauty, would be ex­ceedingly disgusting, if it had as much uni­formity and order in its parts as a dwelling­house.

MR. HOGARTH, in his Analysis of Beauty, has observed, that figures bounded by curve lines are, in general, more beautiful than those bounded by straight lines and angles. He pitches upon two lines, on which, according to him, the Beauty of figure principally pends; and he has illustrated, and supported his doctrine, by a surprising number of in­stances. The one is the Waving Line, or a curve bending backwards and forwards, some­what in the form of the letter  This he calls the Line of Beauty; and shews how often it is found in shells, flowers, and such other ornamental works of nature; as is common also in the figures designed by paint­ers and sculptors, for the purpose of decora  The other Line, which he calls the Line of Grace, is the former waving curve, twisted round some solid body. The curling  worm of a common jack is one of the in­stances he gives of it. Twisted pillars, and twisted horns, also exhibit it. In all the in­stances which he mentions, Variety plainly appears to be so material a principle of Beau­ty, that he seems not to err much when he defines the art of drawing pleasing forms, to be the art of varying well. For the curve line, so much the favourite of painters, rives, according to him, its chief advantage, from its perpetual bending and variation from the stiff regularity of the straight line.

MOTION furnishes another source of Beau­ty, distinct from Figure. Motion of itself is pleasing; and bodies in motion are, caete­ris paribus, preferred to those in rest. It is, however, only gentle motion that belongs to the Beautiful; for when it is very swift, or very forcible, such as that of a torrent, it partakes of the Sublime. The motion of a bird gliding through the air, is extremely Beautiful; the swiftness with which light­ning darts through the heavens, is magnifi­cent and astonishing. And here, it is proper to observe, that the sensations of Sublime and Beautiful are not always distinguished by very distant boundaries; but are capable, in several instances, of approaching towards each other. Thus, a smooth running stream, is one of the most beautiful objects in na­ture: as it swells gradually into a great river, the beautiful, by degrees, is lost in the Su­blime. A young tree is a beautiful object;  a spreading ancient oak, is a venerable and a grand one. The calmness of a fine morn is beautiful; the universal stillness of the evening is highly Sublime. But to return to the Beauty of motion, it will be found, I think, to hold very generally, that motion in a straight line is not so beautiful as in an un­dulating waving direction; and motion up­wards is, commonly too, more agreeable than motion downwards. The easy curling mo of flame and smoke to be instanced, as an object singularly agreeable: and here Mr. Hogarth waving line recurs upon us as a principle of Beauty. That artist observes very ingeniously, that all the common and necessary motions for the business of life, are performed by men in straight or plain lines; but that all the graceful and ornamental movements are made in waving lines: an observation not unworthy of being attended to, by all who study the grace of gesture and action.

THOUGH Colour, Figure, and Motion, be separate principles of Beauty; yet in many beautiful objects they all meet, and thereby render the Beauty both greater, and more complex. Thus, in flowers, trees, animals, we are entertained at once with the delicacy of the colour, with the gracefulness of the figure, and sometimes also with the motion of the object. Although each of these pro­duce a separate agreeable sensation, yet they are of such a similar nature, as readily to  mix and blend in one general perception of Beauty, which we ascribe to the whole ob­ject as its cause: For Beauty is always con­ceived by us, as something residing in the object which raises the pleasant sensation; a sort of glory which dwells upon, and invests it. Perhaps the most complete assemblage of beautiful objects that can any where be found, is presented by a rich natural land­scape, where there is a sufficient variety of objects: fields in verdure, scattered trees and flowers, running water, and animals graz  If to these be joined, some of the pro­ductions of art, which suit such a scene; as a bridge with arches over a river, smoke ris from cottages in the midst of trees, and the distant view of a fine building seen by the rising sun; we then enjoy, in the high­est perfection, that gay, cheerful, and placid sensation which characterises Beauty. To have an eye and a taste formed for catching the peculiar Beauties of such scenes as these, is a necessary requisite for all who attempt poetical description.

THE Beauty of the human countenance is more complex than any that we have yet considered. It includes the Beauty of co­lour, arising from the delicate shades of the complexion; and the Beauty of figure, aris from the lines which form the different features of the face. But the chief Beauty of the countenance depends upon a myste­rious expression, which it conveys of the  qualities of the mind; of good sense, or good humour; of sprightliness, candour, benevo­lence, sensibility, or other amiable dispositi­ons. How it comes to pass, that a certain conformation of features is connected in our idea with certain moral qualities; whether we are taught by instinct, or by experience, to form this connection, and to read the mind in the countenance; belongs not to us now to enquire, nor is indeed easy to resolve. The fact is certain, and acknowledged, that what gives the human countenance its most distinguishing Beauty, is what is called its expression; or an image, which it is conceiv to shew of internal moral dispositions.

THIS leads to observe, that there are cer­tain qualities of the mind which, whether expressed in the countenance, or by words, or by actions, always raise in us a feeling si­milar to that of Beauty. There are two great classes of moral qualities; one is of the high and the great virtues, which require extraor­dinary efforts, and turn upon dangers and sufferings; as heroism, magnanimity, con­tempt of pleasures, and contempt of death. These, as I have observed in a former Lec­ture, excite in the spectator an emotion of Sublimity and Grandeur. The other class is generally of the social virtues, and such as are of a softer and gentler kind; as compas­sion, mildness, friendship, and generosity. These raise in the beholder a sensation of pleasure, so much akin to that produced by  Beautiful external objects, that, though of a more dignified nature, it may, without im­propriety, be classed under the same head.

A SPECIES of Beauty, distinct from any I have yet mentioned, arises from design or art; or, in other words, from the perception of means being adapted to an end; or the parts of any thing being well fitted to answer the design of the whole. When, in consi­dering the structure of a tree or a plant, we observe, how all the parts, the roots, the stem, the bark, and the leaves, are suited to the growth and nutriment of the whole: much more when we survey all the parts and members of a living animal; or when we examine any of the curious works of art; such as a clock, a ship, or any nice machine; the pleasure which we have in the survey, is wholly founded on this sense of Beauty. It is altogether different from the perception of Beauty produced by colour, figure, variety, or any of the causes formerly mentioned. When I look at a watch, for instance, the case of it, if finely engraved, and of curious workmanship, strikes me as beautiful in the former sense; bright colour, exquisite polish, figures finely raised and turned. But when I examine the construction of the spring and the wheels, and praise the Beauty of the in­ternal machinery; my pleasure then arises wholly from the view of that admirable art, with which so many various and complicated parts are made to unite for one purpose.

 THIS sense of Beauty, in fitness and sign, has an extensive influence over many of our ideas. It is the foundation of the Beauty which we discover in the proportion of doors, windows, arches, pillars, and all the orders of architecture. Let the orna­ments of a building be ever so fine and ele­gant in themselves, yet if they interfere with this sense of fitness and design, they lose their Beauty, and hurt the eye, like disagreeable objects. Twisted columns, for instance, are undoubtedly ornamental; but as they have an appearance of weakness, they always dis­please when they are made use of to support any part of a building that is massy, and that seemed to require a more substantial prop. We cannot look upon any work whatever, without being led, by a natural association of ideas, to think of its end and design, and of course to examine the propriety of its parts, in relation to this design and end. When their propriety is clearly discerned, the work seems always to have some Beauty; but when there is a total want of propriety, it never fails of appearing deformed. Our sense of fitness and design, therefore, is so powerful, and holds so high a rank among our perceptions, as to regulate, in a great measure, our other ideas of Beauty: An ob­servation which I the rather make, as it is of the utmost importance, that all who study composition should carefully attend to it. For, in an epic poem, a history, an oration, or any work of genius, we always require, as we do  in other works, a fitness, or adjustment of means, to the end which the author is sup­posed to have in view. Let his description be ever so rich, or his figures ever so elegant, yet, if they are out of place, if they are not proper parts of that whole, if they suit not the main design, they lose all their Beauty; nay, from Beauties they are converted ino Deformities. Such power has our sense of fitness and congruity, to produce a total transformation of an object whose appear­ance otherwise would have been Beautiful.

AFTER having mentioned so many various species of Beauty, it now only remains to take notice of Beauty as it is applied to writing or discourse; a term commonly used in a sense altogether loose and undetermined. For it is applied to all that pleases, either in style or in sentiment, from whatever principle that pleasure flows; and a Beautiful poem or ora means, in common language, no other than a good one, or one well composed. In this sense, it is plain, the word is altogether indefinite, and points at no particular species or kind of Beauty. There is, however, ano­ther sense, somewhat more definite, in which Beauty of writing characterises a particular manner; when it is used to signify a certain grace and amaenity in the turn either of style or sentiment, for which some authors have been peculiarly distinguished. In this sense, it denotes a manner neither remarkably su­blime, nor vehemently passionate, nor un­commonly  sparkling; but such as raises in the reader an emotion of the gentle placid kind, similar to what is raised by the con­templation of beautiful objects in nature; which neither lifts the mind very high, nor agitates it very much, but diffuses over the imagination an agreeable and pleasing sere­nity. Mr. Addison is a writer altogether of this character; and is one of the most pro­per and precise examples that can be given of it. Fenelon, the author of the Adven­tures of Telemachus, may be given as ano­ther example. Virgil too, though very ca­pable of rising on occasions into the Sublime, yet, in his general manner, is distinguished by the character of Beauty and Grace rather than of Sublimity. Among orators, Cicero has more of the Beautiful than Demosthenes, whose genius led him wholly towards vehe­mence and strength.

THIS much it is sufficient to have said up­on the subject of Beauty. We have traced it through a variety of forms; as next to Su­blimity, it is the most copious source of the Pleasures of Taste; and as the consideration of the different appearances, and principles of Beauty, tends to the improvement of Taste in many subjects.

BUT it is not only by appearing under the forms of Sublime or Beautiful, that objects delight the imagination. From several other  principles also, they derive their power of giving it pleasure.

NOVELTY, for instance, has been menti­oned by Mr. Addison, and by every writer on this subject. An object which has no merit to recommend it, except its being un­common or new, by means of this quality alone, produces in the mind a vivid and an agreeable emotion. Hence that passion of curiosity, which prevails so generally among mankind. Objects and ideas which have been long familiar, make too faint an impres­sion to give an agreeable exercise to our facul­ties. New and strange objects rouse the mind from its dormant state, by giving it a quick and pleasing impulse. Hence, in a great measure, the entertainment afforded us by fiction and romance. The emotion raised by Novelty is of a more lively and pun­gent nature, than that produced by Beauty; but much shorter in its continuance. For if the object have in itself no charms to hold our attention, the shining gloss thrown upon it by Novelty soon wears off.

BESIDES Novelty, Imitation is another source of Pleasure to Taste. This gives rise to what Mr. Addison terms, the Secondary Pleasures of Imagination; which form, doubt­less, a very extensive class. For all Imitation affords some pleasure; not only the Imitation of beautiful or great objects, by recalling the original ideas of Beauty or Grandeur which  such objects themselves exhibited; but even objects which have neither Beauty nor Gran­deur, nay, some which are terrible or deform  please us in a secondary or represented view.

THE Pleasures of Melody and Harmony belong also to Taste. There is no agreeable sensation we receive, either from Beauty or Snblimity, but what is capable of being heightened by the power of musical sound. Whence the delight of poetical numbers; and even of the more concealed and looser measures of prose. Wit, Humour, and Ri­dicule likewise open a variety of pleasures to Taste, quite distinct from any that we have yet considered.

AT present it is not necessary to pursue any farther the subject of the Pleasures of Taste. I have opened some of the general principles; it is time now to make the appli­cation to our chief subject. If the question be put, To what class of those Pleasures of Taste which I have enumerated, that Plea­sure is to be referred, which we receive from poetry, eloquence, or fine writing? My an­swer is, Not to any one, but to them all. This singular advantage, writing and dis­course possess, that they encompass so large and rich a field on all sides, and have power to exhibit, in great perfection, not a single set of objects only, but almost the whole of those which give Pleasure to Taste and Ima­gination;  whether that Pleasure arise from Su­blimity, from Beauty in its different forms, from Design and Art, from Moral Sentiment, from Novelty, from Harmony, from Wit, Humour and Ridicule. To whichsoever of these the peculiar bent of a person Taste lies, from some writer or other, he has it al­ways in his power to receive the gratification of it.

NOW this high power which eloquence and poetry possess, of supplying Taste and Imagination with such a wide circle of plea­sures, they derive altogether from their hav a greater capacity of Imitation and scription than is possessed by any other art. Of all the means which human ingenuity has contrived for recalling the images of real ob­jects, and awakening, by representation, si­milar emotions to those which are raised by the original, none is so full and extensive as that which is executed by words and writing. Through the assistance of this happy inven  there is nothing, either in the natural or moral world, but what can be represented and set before the mind, in colours very strong and lively. Hence it is usual among critical writers, to speak of Discourse as the chief of all the imitative or mimetic arts; they compare it with painting and with sculp­ture, and in many respects prefer it justly be­fore them.

 THIS style was first introduced by Aristotle in his Poetics; and since his time, has acquir a general currency among modern authors. But, as it is of consequence to introduce as much precision as possible into critical lan­guage, I must observe, that this manner of speaking is not accurate. Neither discourse in general, nor poetry in particular, can be called altogether imitative arts. We must distinguish between Imitation and Description, which are ideas that should not be confound  Imitation is performed by means of somewhat that has a natural likeness and re­semblance to the thing imitated, and of con­sequence is understood by all; such are sta­tues and pictures. Description, again, is the raising in the mind the conception of an ob­ject by means of some arbitrary or instituted symbols, understood only by those who agree in the institution of them; such are words and writing. Words have no natural resem­blance to the ideas or objects which they are employed to signify; but a statue or a picture has a natural likeness to the original. And therefore Imitation and Description differ considerably in their nature from each other.

AS far, indeed, as a poet or a historian in­troduces into his work persons actually speak  and by the words which he puts into their mouths, represents the discourse which they might be supposed to hold; so far his art may more accurately be called Imitative: and this is the case in all dramatic compositi­on.  But in Narrative or Descriptive works, it can with no propriety be called so. Who, for instance, would call Virgil Description of a tempest, in the first Aeneid, an Imitation of a storm? If we heard of the Imitation of a battle, we might naturally think of some mock fight, or representation of a battle on the stage, but would never apprehend, that it meant one of Homer Descriptions in the Iliad. I admit, at the same time, that Imita and Description agree in their principal effect, of recalling by external signs, the ideas of things which we do not see. But though in this they coincide, yet it should not be forgotten, that the terms themselves are not synonymous; that they import different means of effecting the same end; and of course make different impressions on the mind*.

 WHETHER we consider Poetry in particu­lar, and Discourse in general, as Imitative or Descriptive; it is evident, that their whole power, in recalling the impressions of real objects, is derived from the significancy of words. As their excellency flows altogether from this source, we must, in order to make way for further enquiries, begin at this foun­tain head. I shall, therefore, in the next Lec­ture, enter upon the consideration of Lan­guage: of the origin, the progress, and con­struction of which, I purpose to treat at some length.

LECTURE  RISE AND PROGRESS OF LANGUAGE.

HAVING finished my observations on the Pleasures of Taste, which were meant to be introductory to the principal subject of these Lectures, I now begin to treat of Lan­guage; which is the foundation of the whole power of eloquence. This will lead to a considerable discussion; and there are few subjects belonging to polite literature, which more merit such a discussion. I shall first give a History of the Rise and Progress of Language in several particulars, from its early to its more advanced periods; which shall be followed by a similar History of the Rise and Progress of Writing. I shall next give some account of the Construction of Language, or the Principles of Universal Grammar; and shall, lastly, apply these observations more particularly to the English Tongue*.

 LANGUAGE, in general, signifies the ex­pression of our ideas by certain articulate sounds, which are used as the signs of those ideas. By articulate sounds, are meant those modulations of simple voice, or of sound emitted from the thorax, which are formed by means of the mouth and its several organs, the teeth, the tongue, the lips, and the pa­late. How far there is any natural connex­ion between the ideas of the mind and the sounds emitted, will appear from what I am afterwards to offer. But as the natural con­nexion can, upon any system, affect only a small part of the fabric of Language; the connection between words and ideas may, in general, be considered as arbitrary and con­ventional, owing to the agreement of men among themselves; the clear proof of which is, that different nations have different Lan­guages, or a different set of articulate sounds, which they have chosen for communicating their ideas.

THIS artificial method of communicating thought, we now behold carried to the high­est  perfection. Language is become a vehi­cle by which the most delicate and refined emotions of one mind can be transmitted, or, if we may so speak, transfused into another. Not only are names given to all objects around us, by which means an easy and speedy intercourse is carried on for provid the necessaries of life, but all the relati­ons and differences among these objects are minutely marked, the invisible sentiments of the mind are described, the most abstract notions and conceptions are rendered intelli­gible; and all the ideas which science can discover, or imagination create, are known by their proper names. Nay, Language has been carried so far, as to be made an instru­ment of the most refined luxury. Not rest in mere perspicuity, we require orna­ment also; not satisfied with having the conceptions of others made known to us, we make a farther demand, to have them so decked and adorned as to entertain our fan­cy; and this demand, it is found very possi­ble to gratify. In this state, we now find Language. In this state, it has been found among many nations for some thousand years. The object is become familiar; and, like the expanse of the firmament, and other great objects, which we are accustomed to behold, we behold it without wonder.

BUT carry your thoughts back to the first dawn of Language among men. Reflect upon the feeble beginnings from which it  must have arisen, and upon the many and great obstacles which it must have encoun­tered in its progress; and you will find rea­son for the highest astonishment, on viewing the height which it has now attained. We admire several of the inventions of art; we plume ourselves on some discoveries which have been made in latter ages, serving to vance knowledge, and to render life com­fortable; we speak of them as the boast of human reason. But certainly no invention is entitled to any such degree of admiration as that of Language; which, too must have been the product of the first and rudest ages, if indeed it can be considered as a human in­vention at all.

THINK of the circumstances of mankind when Languages began to be formed. They were a wandering scattered race; no society among them except families; and the family society too very imperfect, as their method of living by hunting or pasturage must have se­parated them frequently from one another. In this situation, when so much divided, and their intercourse so rare, How could any one set of sounds, or words, be generally agreed on as the signs of their ideas? Supposing that a few, whom chance or necessity threw to­gether, agreed by some means upon certain signs, yet by what authority could these be propagated among other tribes or families, so as to spread and grow up into a Language? One would think, that in order to any Lan­guage  fixing and extending itself, men must have been previously gathered together in considerable numbers; society must have been already far advanced; and yet, on the other hand, there seems to have been an absolute necessity for Speech, previous to the forma of Society. For, by what bond could any multitude of men be kept together, or be made to join in the prosecution of any common interest, until once, by the inter­vention of Speech, they could communicate their wants and intentions to each other? So that, either how Society could form itself, previously to Language; or how words could rise into a Language, previously to Society formed, seem to be points attended with equal difficulty. And when we consider farther, that curious analogy which prevails in the construction of almost all Languages, and that deep and subtile logic on which they are founded, difficulties increase so much upon us, on all hands, that there seems to be no small reason for referring the first origin of all Language to divine teaching or inspira 

BUT supposing Language to have a Divine original, we cannot, however, suppose, that a perfect system of it was all at once given to man. It is much more natural to think, that God taught our first parents only such Language as suited their present occasions; leaving them, as he did in other things, to enlarge and improve it as their future neces­sities  should require. Consequently, those first rudiments of Speech must have been poor and narrow; and we are at full liberty to enquire in what manner, and by what steps, Language advanced to the state in which we now find it. The history which I am to give of this progress, will suggest se­veral things, both curious in themselves, and useful in our future disquisitions.

IF we should suppose a period before any words were invented or known, it is clear, that men could have no other method of communicating to others what they felt, than by the cries of passion, accompanied with such motions and gestures as were farther expressive of passion. For these are the only signs which nature teaches all men, and which are understood by all. One who saw another going into some place where he himself had been frightened, or exposed to danger, and who sought to warn his neighbour of the danger, could contrive no other way of do so, than by uttering those cries, and mak those gestures, which are the signs of fear: just as two men, at this day, would endeavour to make themselves be understood by each other, who should be thrown toge­ther on a desolate island, ignorant of one an­other Language. Those exclamations, there­fore, which by Grammarians are called Inter­jections, uttered in a strong and passionate manner, were, beyond doubt, the first ele­ments or beginnings of Speech.

 WHEN more enlarged communication be­came necessary, and names began to be as­signed to objects, in what manner can we suppose men to have proceeded in this assign­ation of names, or invention of words? Un­doubtedly, by imitating, as much as they could, the nature of the object which they named, by the sound of the name which they gave to it. As a Painter, who would repre­sent grass, must employ a green colour; so, in the beginnings of Language, one giving a name to any thing harsh or boisterous, would of course employ a harsh or boisterous sound. He could not do otherwise, if he meant to excite in the hearer the idea of that thing which he sought to name. To suppose words invented, or names given, to things, in a manner purely arbitrary, without any ground or reason, is to suppose an effect without a cause. There must have always been some motive which led to the assignation of one name rather than another; and we can con­ceive no motive which would more univer­sally operate upon men in their first efforts towards Language, than a desire to paint by Speech, the objects which they named, in a manner more or less complete, according as the vocal organs had it in their power to ef­fect this imitation.

WHEREVER objects were to be named, in which sound, noise, or motion were concern  the imitation by words was abundantly obvious. Nothing was more natural, than  to imitate, by the sound of the voice, the quality of the sound or noise which any ex­ternal object made; and to form its name accordingly. Thus, in all Languages, we find a multitude of words that are evidently constructed upon this principle. A certain bird is termed the Cuckoo, from the sound which it emits. When one sort of wind is said to whistle, and another to roar; when a serpent is said to hiss; a fly to buz, and fall timber to crash; when a stream is said to flow, and hail to rattle; the analogy between the word and the thing signified is plainly dis­cernible.

IN the names of objects which address the sight only, where neither noise nor motion are concerned, and still more in the terms appropriated to moral ideas, this analogy ap­pears to fail. Many learned men, however, have been of opinion, that though, in such cases, it becomes more obscure, yet it is not altogether lost; but that throughout the ra­dical words of all Languages, there may be traced some degree of correspondence with the object signified. Witn regard to moral and intellectual ideas, they remark, that, in every Language, the terms significant of them, are derived from the names of sensi­ble objects to which they are conceived to be analogous; and with regard to sensible ob­jects pertaining merely to sight, they remark, that their most distinguishing qualities have certain radical sounds appropriated to the  expression of them, in a great variety of Languages. Stability, for instance, fluidity, hollowness, smoothness, gentleness, violence,   they imagine to be painted by the sound of certain letters or syllables, which have some relation to those different states of visi­ble objects, on account of an obscure resem­blance which the organs of voice are capa­ble of assuming to such external qualities. By this natural mechanism, they imagine all Languages to have been at first constructed, and the roots of their capital words formed*.

 AS far as this system is founded in truth, Language appears to be not altogether arbi­trary in its origin. Among the ancient Stoic and Platonic Philosophers, it was a question much agitated, Utrum nomina rerum sint naturÃ¢, an impositione? [...]; by which they meant, Whether words were merely conventional symbols; of the rise of which no account could be given, except the plea­sure of the first inventors of Language? or, Whether there was some principle in nature that led to the assignation of particular names to particular objects; and those of the Plato­nic school favoured the latter opinion*?

 THIS principle, however, of a natural re­lation between words and objects, can only be applied to Language in its most simple and primitive state. Though, in every Tongue, some remains of it, as I have shewn above, can be traced, it were utterly in vain to search for it throughout the whole construction of any modern Language. As the multitude of terms increase in every nation, and the im­mense field of Language is filled up, words, by a thousand fanciful and irregular methods of derivation and composition, come to viate widely from the primitive character of their roots, and to lose all analogy or resem­blance in sound to the things signified. In this state we now find Language. Words, as we now employ them, taken in the gene­ral, may be considered as symbols, not as imitations; as arbitrary, or instituted, not natural signs of ideas. But there can be no doubt, I think, that Language, the nearer we remount to its rise among men, will be found to partake more of a natural expressi­on. As it could be originally formed on no­thing but imitation, it would, in its primi­tive state, be more picturesque; much more barren indeed, and narrow in the circle of its terms, than now; but so far as it went, more expressive by sound of the thing signi­fied. This, then, may be assumed as one  character of the first state, or beginnings, of Language, among every savage tribe.

A SECOND character of Language, in its early state, is drawn from the manner in which words were at first pronounced, or ut­tered, by men. Interjections, I showed, or passionate exclamations, were the first ele­ments of Speech. Men laboured to com­municate their feelings to one another, by those expressive cries and gestures which na­ture taught them. After words, or names of objects, began to be invented, this mode of speaking, by natural signs, could not be all at once disused. For Language, in its in­fancy, must have been extremely barren; and there certainly was a period, among all rude nations, when conversation was carried on by a very few words, intermixed with many exclamations and earnest gestures. The small stock of words which men as yet pos­sessed, rendered those helps absolutely neces­sary for explaining their conceptions; and rude, uncultivated men, not having always at hand even the few words which they knew, would naturally labour to make themselves understood, by varying their tones of voice, and accompanying their tones with the most significant gesticulations they could make. At this day, when persons attempt to speak in any Language which they possess imper­fectly, they have recourse to all these supple­mental methods, in order to render them­selves more intelligible. The plan too, ac­cording  to which I have shown, that Lan­guage was originally constructed, upon re­semblance or analogy, as far as was possible, to the thing signified, would naturally lead men to utter their words with more emphasis and force, as long as Language was a sort of painting by means of sound. For all those reasons this may be assumed as a principle, that the pronunciation of the earliest Lan­guages was accompanied with more gesticu­lation, and with more and greater inflexions of voice, than what we now use; there was more action in it; and it was more upon a crying or singing tone.

To this manner of speaking, necessity first gave rise. But we must observe, that, after this necessity had, in a great measure, ceased, by Language becoming, in process of time, more extensive and copious, the ancient man­ner of Speech still subsisted among many na­tions; and what had arisen from necessity, continued to be used for ornament. Where­ver there was much fire and vivacity in the genius of nations, they were naturally inclin to a mode of conversation which gratified the imagination so much; for, an imaginati­on which is warm, is always prone to throw both a great deal of action, and a variety of tones, into discourse. Upon this princi­ple, Dr. Warburton accounts for so much speaking by action, as we find among the Old Testament Prophets; as when Jeremiah breaks the potter vessel, in sight of the peo­ple;  throws a book into the Euphrates; puts on bonds and yokes; and carries out his household stuff; all which, he imagines, might be significant modes of expression, very na­tural in those ages, when men were accustom to explain themselves so much by actions and gestures. In like manner, among the Northern American tribes, certain motions and actions were found to be much used as explanatory of their meaning, on all their great occasions of intercourse with each other; and by the belts and strings of wampum, which they gave and received, they were ac­customed to declare their meaning, as much as by their discourses.

WITH regard to inflexions of voice, these are so natural, that, to some nations, it has appeared easier to express different ideas, by varying the tone with which they pronounced the same word, than to contrive words for all their ideas. This is the practice of the Chinese in particular. The number of words in their Language is said not to be great; but, in speaking, they vary each of their words on no less than five different tones, by which they make the same word signify five different things. This must give a great appearance of music or singing to their Speech. For those inflexions of voice which, in the infancy of Language, were no more than harsh or dissonant cries, must, as Language gradually polishes, pass into more smooth and  musical sounds; and hence is formed, what we call, the Prosody of a Language.

IT is remarkable, and deserves attention, that, both in the Greek and Roman Lan­guages, this musical and gesticulating pro­nunciation was retained in a very high gree. Without having attended to this, we will be at a loss in understanding several pas­sages of the Classics, which relate to the pub­lic speaking, and the theatrical entertain­ments, of the antients. It appears, from many circumstances, that the prosody both of the Greeks and Romans, was carried much farther than ours; or that they spoke with more, and stronger, inflexions of voice than we use. The quantity of their sylla­bles was much more fixed than in any of the modern Languages, and rendered much more sensible to the ear in pronouncing them. Besides quantities, or the difference of short and long, accents were placed upon most of their syllables, the acute, grave, and circum­flex; the use of which accents we have now entirely lost, but which, we know, determi­ned the speaker voice to rise or fall. Our modern pronunciation must have appeared to them a lifeless monotony. The declamation of their orators, and the pronunciation of their actors upon the stage, approached to the nature of recitative in music; was capable of being marked in notes, and supported with instruments; as several learned men have fully proved. And if this was the case, as  they have shown, among the Romans, the Greeks, it is well known, were still a more musical people than the Romans, and carried their attention to tone and pronunciation much farther in every public exhibition. A­ristotle, in his PoÃ«tics, considers the music of Tragedy as one of its chief and most es­sential parts.

THE case was parallel with regard to ges­tures: for strong tones, and animated ges­tures, we may observe, always go together. Action is treated of by all the ancient critics, as the chief quality in every public speaker. The action, both of the orators and the players in Greece and Rome, was far more vehement than what we are accustomed to. Roscius would have seemed a madman to us. Gesture was of such consequence upon the ancient stage, that there is reason for believ  that, on some occasions, the speaking and the acting part were divided, which, ac­cording to our ideas, would form a strange exhibition; one player spoke the words in the proper tones, while another performed the corresponding motions and gestures. We learn from Cicero, that it was a contest be­tween him and Roscius, whether he could express a sentiment in a greater variety of phrases, or Roscius in a greater variety of in­telligible significant gestures. At last, ges­ture came to engross the stage wholly; for, under the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, the favourite entertainment of the Public  was the pantomime, which was carried on entirely by mute gesticulation. The people were moved, and wept at it, as much as at tragedies; and the passion for it became so strong, that laws were obliged to be made, for restraining the Senators from studying the pantomime art. Now, though in declama­tions and theatrical exhibitions, both tone and gesture were, doubtless, carried much farther than in common discourse; yet pub­lic speaking, of any kind, must, in every country, bear some proportion to the man­ner that is used in conversation; and such public entertainments as I have now menti­oned, could never have been relished by a nation, whose tones and gestures, in dis­course, were as languid as ours.

WHEN the Barbarians spread themselves over the Roman Empire, these more phleg­matic nations did not retain the accents, the tones and gestures, which necessity at first introduced, and custom and fancy afterwards so long supported, in the Greek and Roman Languages. As the Latin Tongue was lost in their idioms, so the character of speech and pronunciation began to be changed throughout Europe. Nothing of the same attention was paid to the music of Language, or to the pomp of declamation, and theatri­cal action. Both conversation and public speaking became more simple and plain, such as we now find it; without that enthusiastic mixture of tones and gestures, which distin­guished  the ancient nations. At the restora of letters, the genius of Language was so much altered, and the manners of the people become so different, that it was no easy matter to understand what the Antients had said, concerning their declamations and public spectacles. Our plain manner of speak  in these northern countries, expresses the passions with sufficient energy, to move those who are not accustomed to any more vehement manner. But, undoubtedly, more varied tones, and more animated motions, carry a natural expression of warmer feel­ings. Accordingly, in different modern Lan­guages, the prosody of Speech partakes more of music, in proportion to the liveliness and sensibility of the people. A Frenchman both varies his accents, and gesticulates while he speaks, much more than an Englishman. An Italian, a great deal more than either. Mu­sical pronunciation and expressive gesture are, to this day, the distinction of Italy.

FROM the pronunciation of Language, let us proceed, in the third place, to consider of the Style of Language in its most early state, and of its progress in this respect also. As the manner in which men at first uttered their words, and maintained conversation, was strong and expressive, enforcing their imper­fectly expressed ideas by cries and gestures; so the Language which they used, could be no other than full of figures and meta­phors,  not correct indeed, but forcible and picturesque.

WE are apt, upon a superficial view, to imagine, that those modes of expression which are called Figures of Speech, are among the chief refinements of Speech, not invented till after Language had advanced to its later pe­riods, and mankind were brought into a po­lished state; and that, then, they were vised by Orators and Rhetoricians. The quite contrary of this is the truth. Mankind ne­ver employed so many figures of Speech, as when they had hardly any words for expres­sing their meaning.

FOR first, the want of proper names for every object, obliged them to use one name for many; and, of course, to express them­selves by comparisons, metaphors, allusions, and all those substituted forms of Speech which render Language figurative. Next, as the objects with which they were most con­versant, were the sensible, material objects around them, names would be given to those objects long before words were invented for signifying the dispositions of the mind, or any sort of moral and intellectual ideas. Hence, the early Language of men being entirely made up of words descriptive of sensible ob­jects, it became, of necessity, extremely me­taphorical. For, to signify any desire or pas­sion, or any act or feeling of the mind, they had no precise expression which was appro­priated  to that purpose, but were under a necessity of painting the emotion, or passion, which they felt, by allusion to those sensible objects which had most relation to it, and which could render it, in some sort, visible to others.

BUT it was not necessity alone, that gave rise to this figured style. Other circumstances also, at the commencement of Language, contributed to it. In the infancy of all so­cieties, men are much under the dominion of imagination and passion. They live scat­tered and dispersed; they are unacquainted with the course of things; they are, every day, meeting with new and strange objects. Fear and surprise, wonder and astonishment, are their most frequent passions. Their Lan­guage will necessarily partake of this cha­racter of their minds. They will be prone to exaggeration and hyperbole. They will be given to describe every thing with the strongest colours, and most vehement expres­sions; infinitely more than men living in the advanced and cultivated periods of Society, when their imagination is more chastened, their passions are more tamed, and a wider experience has rendered the objects of life more familiar to them. Even the manner in which I before showed that the first tribes of men uttered their words, would have con­siderable influence on their style. Wherever strong exclamations, tones, and gestures, en­ter much into conversation, the imagination  is always more exercised; a greater effort of fancy and passion is excited. Consequently, the fancy kept awake, and rendered more sprightly by this mode of utterance, operates upon style, and enlivens it more.

THESE reasonings are confirmed by un­doubted facts. The style of all the most early Languages, among nations who are in the first and rude periods of Society, is found, without exception, to be full of figures; hy­perbolical and picturesque in a high degree. We have a striking instance of this in the American Languages, which are known, by the most authentic accounts, to be figurative to excess. The Iroquois and Illinois, carry on their treaties and public transactions with bolder metaphors, and greater pomp of style, than we use in our poetical productions*.

 ANOTHER remarkable instance is, the style of the Old Testament, which is carried on by constant allusions to sensible objects. In­iquity, or guilt, is expressed by a spotted garment; misery, by drinking the cup of astonishment; vain pursuits, by feed on ashes; a sinful life, by a crooked path; prosperity, by the candle of the Lord shining on our head; and the like, in innumerable instances. Hence, we have been accustomed to call this sort of style, the Oriental Style; as fancying it to be peculiar to the nations of the East: Whereas, from the American Style, and from many other instances, it plainly appears not to have been peculiar to any one region or climate; but to have been common to all nations, in certain periods of Society and Language.

HENCE, we may receive some light con­cerning that seeming paradox, that Poetry is more ancient than Prose. I shall have occa­sion to discuss this point fully hereafter, when I come to treat of the Nature and Origin of Poetry. At present, it is sufficient to ob­serve, that, from what has been said it plain­ly  appears, that the style of all Language must have been originally poetical; strongly tinctured with that enthusiasm, and that scriptive, metaphorical expression, which dis­tinguishes Poetry.

AS Language, in its progress, began to grow more copious, it gradually lost that fi­gurative style, which was its early character. When men were furnished with proper and familiar names for every object, both sensible and moral, they were not obliged to use so many circumlocutions. Style became more precise, and, of course, more simple. Ima­gination too, in proportion as Society vanced, had less influence over mankind. The vehement manner of speaking by tones and gestures, became not so universal. The understanding was more exercised; the fan­cy, less. Intercourse among mankind be­coming more extensive and frequent, clear­ness of style, in signifying their meaning to each other, was the chief object of atten  In place of Poets, Philosophers became the instructors of men; and, in their reason­ings on all different subjects, introduced that plainer and simpler style of composition, which we now call Prose. Among the Greeks, Pherecydes of Scyros, the master of Pythagoras, is recorded to have been the first, who, in this sense, composed any writing in prose. The ancient metaphorical and poeti­cal dress of Language, was now laid aside from the intercourse of men, and reserved  for those occasions only, on which ornament was professedly studied.

THUS I have pursued the History of Lan­guage through some of the variations it has undergone: I have considered it, in the first structure, and composition, of words; in the manner of uttering or pronouncing words; and in the style and character of Speech. I have yet to consider it in another view, re­specting the order and arrangement of words; when we shall find a progress to have taken place, similar to what I have been now il­lustrating.

LECTURE  RISE AND PROGRESS OF LANGUAGE, AND of WRITING.

WHEN we attend to the order in which words are arranged in a sentence, or significant proposition, we find a very re­markable difference between the ancient and the modern Tongues. The consideration of this will serve to unfold farther the genius of Language, and to show the causes of those alterations, which it has undergone, in the progress of Society.

IN order to conceive distinctly the nature of that alteration of which I now speak, let us go back, as we did formerly, to the most early period of Language. Let us figure to ourselves a Savage, who beholds some ob­ject, such as fruit, which raises his desire, and who requests another to give it to him. Supposing our Savage to be unacquainted with words, he would, in that case, labour to  make himself be understood, by pointing earnestly at the object which he desired, and uttering at the same time a passionate cry. Supposing him to have acquired words, the first word which he uttered would, of course, be the name of that object. He would not express himself, according to our English or­der of construction, Give me fruit; but according to the Latin order, Fruit give me; Fructum da mihi: For this plain reason, that his attention was wholly directed towards fruit, the desired object. This was the exciting idea; the object which moved him to speak; and, of course, would be the first named. Such an arrangement is pre­cisely putting into words the gesture which nature taught the Savage to make, before he was acquainted with words; and therefore it may be depended upon as certain, that he would fall most readily into this arrange­ment.

ACCUSTOMED now to a different method of ordering our words, we call this an inver­sion, and consider it as a forced and unnatu­ral order of Speech. But though not the most logical, it is, however, in one view, the most natural order; because, it is the order suggested by imagination and desire, which always impel us to mention their object in the first place. We might therefore con­clude, a priori, that this would be the order in which words were most commonly ar­ranged at the beginnings of Language; and  accordingly we find, in fact, that, in this or­der, words are arranged in most of the anti­ent Tongues; as in the Greek and the tin; and it is said also, in the Russian, the the Sclavonic, the GaÃ«lic, and several of the American Tongues.

IN the Latin Language, the arrangement which most commonly obtains, is, to place first, in the sentence, that word which ex­presses the principal object of the discourse, together with its circumstances; and after­wards, the person, or the thing, that acts upon it. Thus Sallust, comparing together the mind and the body; Animi imperio, corporis servitio, magis utimur; which order certainly renders the sentence more live­ly and striking, than when it is arranged ac­cording to our English construction; We make most use of the direction of the soul, and of the service of the body. The tin order gratifies more the rapidity of the imagination, which naturally runs first to that which is its chief object; and having once named it, carries it in view throughout the rest of the sentence. In the same man­ner in poetry:
Justum & tenacem propositi virum,
Non civium ardor prava jubentium,
Non vultus instantis tyranni,
Mente quatit solida. ”

Every person of taste must be sensible, that here the words are arranged with a much  greater regard to the figure which the several objects make in the fancy, than our English construction admits; which would require the Justum & tenacem propositi virum, though, undoubtedly, the capital object in the sentence, to be thrown into the last place.

I HAVE said, that, in the Greek and Ro­man Languages, the most common arrange­ment is, to place that first which strikes the imagination of the speaker most. I do not, however, pretend, that this holds without exception. Sometimes regard to the har­mony of the period requires a different order; and in Languages susceptible of so much mu­sical beauty, and pronounced with so much tone and modulation as were used by those nations, the harmony of periods was an ob­ject carefully studied. Sometimes too, at­tention to the perspicuity, to the force, or to the artful suspension of the speaker mean  alter this order; and produce such va­rieties in the arrangement, that it is not easy to reduce them to any one principle. But, in general, this was the genius and character of most of the ancient Languages, to give such full liberty to the collocation of words, as allowed them to assume whatever order was most agreeable to the speaker imagina  The Hebrew is, indeed, an excepti­on: which, though not altogether without inversions, yet employs them less frequently, and approaches nearer to the English con­struction,  than either the Greek or the tin.

ALL the modern Languages of Europe have adopted a different arrangement from the ancient  In their prose compositions, very little variety is admitted in the colloca of words; they are mostly fixed to one order; and that order is, what may be called, the Order of the Understanding. They place first in the sentence, the person or thing which speaks or acts; next, its action; and lastly, the object of its action. So that the ideas are made to succeed to one another, not according to the degree of importance which the several objects carry in the imagination, but according to the order of nature and of time.

AN English writer, paying a compliment to a great man, would say thus: It is im­possible for me to pass over, in silence, such remarkable mildness, such singular and un­heard of clemency, and such unusual mo­deration, in the exercise of supreme pow­er. Here we have, first presented to us, the person who speaks. It is impossible for me; next, what that person is to do, impossible for him to pass over in silence; and lastly, the object which moves him so to do, the mildness, clemency, and modera of his patron. Cicero, from whom I have translated these words, just reverses this order; beginning with the object, plac  that first which was the exciting idea in the speaker mind, and ending with the speaker and his action. Tantam mansue­tudinem, tam inusitatam inauditamque cle­mentiam, tantumque in summa potestate rerum omnium modum, tacitus multo modo praeterire possum. (Orat. pro Mar­cell.)

THE Latin order is more animated; the English, more clear and distinct. The Ro­mans generally arranged their words accord to the order in which the ideas rose in the speaker imagination. We arrange them according to the order in which the under­standing directs those ideas to be exhibited, in succession, to the view of another. Our arrangement, therefore, appears to be the consequence of greater refinement in the art of Speech; as far as clearness in communi­cation is understood to be the end of Speech.

IN poetry, where we are supposed to rise above the ordinary style, and to speak the Language of fancy and passion, our arrange­ment is not altogether so limited; but some greater liberty is allowed for transposition, and inversion. Even there, however, that liberty is confined within narrow bounds, in comparison of the ancient Languages. The different modern Tongues vary from one another, in this respect. The French Lan­guage is, of them all, the most determinate in the order of its words, and admits the  least of inversion, either in prose or poetry The English admits it more. But the Itali­an retains the most of the ancient transposi­tive character; though one is apt to think, at the expence of a little obscurity in the style of some of their authors, who deal most in these transpositions.

IT is proper, next, to observe, that there is one circumstance in the structure of all the modern Tongues, which, of necessity, limits their arrangement, in a great measure, to one fixed and determinate train. We have disused those differences of termination, which, in the Greek and Latin, distinguished the several cases of nouns, and tenses of verbs; and which, thereby, pointed out the mutual relation of the several words in a sen­tence to one another, though the related words were disjoined, and placed in different parts of the sentence. This is an alteration in the structure of Language, of which I shall have occasion to say more in the next Lecture. One obvious effect of it is, that we have now, for the most part, no way left us to shew the close relation of any two words to one another in meaning, but by placing them close to one another in the pe­riod. For instance; the Romans could, with propriety, express themselves thus;
Extinctum nymphae crudeli funere Daphnim
Flebant. ”

 Because Extinctum & Daphnim, being both in the accusative case, this showed, that the adjective and the substantive were related to each other, though placed at the two ex­tremities of the line; and that both were governed by the active verb Flebant, to which nymphae plainly appeared to be the nominative. The different terminations here reduced all into order, and made the connec of the several words perfectly clear. But let us translate these words literally into English, according to the Latin arrange­ment; Dead the nymphs by a cruel fate Daphnis lamented; and they become a perfect riddle, in which it is impossible to find any meaning.

IT was by means of this contrivance, which obtained in almost all the ancient Lan­guages, of varying the termination of nouns and verbs, and thereby pointing out the con­cordance and the government of the words, in a sentence, that they enjoyed so much liberty of transposition, and could marshal and arrange their words in any way that gra­tified the imagination, or pleased the ear. When Language came to be modelled by the northern nations who overran the empire, they dropped the cases of nouns, and the different termination of verbs, with the more ease, because they placed no great value upon the advantages arising from such a structure of Language. They were attentive only to clearness, and copiousness of expression. They  neither regarded much the harmony of sound, nor sought to gratify the imagination by the collocation of words. They studied solely to express themselves in such a manner as should exhibit their ideas to others in the most distinct and intelligible order. And hence, if our Language, by reason of the simple ar­rangement of its words, possesses less har­mony, less beauty, and less force, than the Greek or Latin; it is, however, in its mean  more obvious and plain.

THUS I have shewn what the natural Pro­gress of Language has been, in several mate­rial articles; and this account of the Genius and Progress of Language, lays a foundation for many observations, both curious and use­ful. From what has been said, in this, and the preceding Lecture, it appears, that Lan­guage was, at first, barren in words, but scriptive by the sound of these words; and expressive in the manner of uttering them, by the aid of significant tones and gestures: Style was figurative and poetical: arrange­ment was fanciful and lively. It appears, that, in all the successive changes which Lan­guage has undergone, as the world advanced, the understanding has gained ground on the fancy and imagination. The Progress of Language, in this respect, resembles the pro­gress of age in man. The imagination is most vigorous and predominant in youth; with advancing years, the imagination cools, and the understanding ripens. Thus Lan­guage,  proceeding from sterility to copious­ness, hath, at the same time, proceeded from vivacity to accuracy; from fire and enthusi­asm, to coolness and precision. Those cha­racters of early Language, descriptive sound, vehement tones and gestures, figurative style, and inverted arrangement, all hang together, have a mutual influence on each other; and have all gradually given place, to arbitrary sounds, calm pronunciation, simple style, plain arrangement. Language is become, in modern times, more correct, indeed, and ac­curate; but, however, less striking and ani­mated: In its ancient state, more favourable to poetry and oratory; in its present, to rea­son and philosophy.

HAVING finished my account of the Pro­gress of Speech, I proceed to give an account of the Progress of Writing, which next mands our notice; though it will not require so full a discussion as the former subject.

NEXT to Speech, Writing is, beyond doubt, the most useful art of which men are possess  It is plainly an improvement upon Speech, and therefore must have been poste­rior to it in order of time. At first, men thought of nothing more than communicat their thoughts to one another, when pre­sent, by means of words, or sounds, which they uttered. Afterwards, they devised this further method, of mutual communication with one another, when absent, by means of  marks or characters presented to the eye, which we call Writing.

WRITTEN characters are of two sorts. They are either signs for things, or signs for words. Of the former sort, signs of things, are the pictures, hieroglyphics, and symbols, employed by the ancient nations; of the lat­ter sort, signs for words, are the alphabetical characters, now employed by all Europeans. These two kinds of Writing are generically, and essentially, distinct.

PICTURES were, undoubtedly, the first essay towards Writing. Imitation is so natu­ral to man, that, in all ages, and among all nations, some methods have obtained, of co­pying or tracing the likeness of sensible ob­jects. Those methods would soon be em­ployed by men for giving some imperfect in­formation to others, at a distance, of what had happened; or, for preserving the memo­ry of facts which they sought to record. Thus, to signify that one man had killed an­other, they drew the figure of one man stretched upon the earth, and of another standing by him with a deadly weapon in his hand. We find, in fact, that, when Ame­rica was first discovered, this was the only sort of Writing known in the kingdom of Mexico. By historical pictures, the Mexi­cans are said to have transmitted the memory of the most important transactions of their em­pire. These, however, must have been ex­tremely  imperfect records; and the nations who had no other, must have been very gross and rude. Pictures could do no more than delineate external events. They could nei­ther exhibit the connections of them, nor describe such qualities as were not visible to the eye, nor convey any idea of the disposi­tions, or words, of men.

TO supply, in some degree, this defect, there arose, in process of time, the invention of what are called, Hieroglyphical Charac­ters; which may be considered as the second stage of the Art of Writing. Hieroglyphics consist in certain symbols, which are made to stand for invisible objects, on account of an analogy or resemblance which such symbols were supposed to bear to the objects. Thus, an eye, was the hieroglyphical symbol of knowledge; a circle, of eternity, which has neither beginning, nor end. Hieroglyphics, therefore, were a more refined and extensive species of painting. Pictures delineated the resemblance of external visible objects. Hie­roglyphics painted invisible objects, by analo­gies taken from the external world.

AMONG the Mexicans, were found some traces of hieroglyphical characters, intermix with their historical pictures. But Egypt was the country where this sort of Writing was most studied, and brought into a regular art. In hieroglyphics, was conveyed all the boasted wisdom of their priests. According  to the properties which they ascribed to ani­mals, or the qualities with which they sup­posed natural objects to be endowed, they pitched upon them to be the emblems, or hieroglyphics, of moral objects; and em­ployed them in their Writing for that end. Thus, ingratitude was denominated by a viper; imprudence, by a fly; wisdom, by an ant; victory, by a hawk; a dutiful child, by a stork; a man universally shunned, by an eel, which they supposed to be found in company with no other fish. Sometimes they joined together two or more of these hieroglyphical characters; as, a serpent with a hawk head; to denote nature, with God presiding over it. But, as many of those properties of objects which they assumed for the foundation of their hieroglyphics, were merely imaginary, and the allusions drawn from them were forced and ambiguous; as the conjunction of their characters rendered them still more obscure, and must have ex­pressed very indistinctly the connections and relations of things; this sort of Writing could be no other than aenigmatical, and confused, in the highest degree; and must have been a very imperfect vehicle of knowledge of any kind.

IT has been imagined, that hieroglyphics were an invention of the Egyptian priests, for concealing their learning from common view; and that, upon this account, it was preferred by them to the alphabetical me­thod  of Writing. But this is certainly a mistake. Hieroglyphics were, undoubtedly, employed, at first, from necessity, not from choice or refinement; and would never have been thought of, if alphabetical characters had been known. The nature of the in­vention plainly shows it to have been one of those gross and rude essays towards Writing, which were adopted in the early ages of the world; in order to extend some farther the first method which they had employed of simple pictures, or representations of visible objects. Indeed, in after-times, when alpha­betical Writing was introduced into Egypt, and the hieroglyphical was, of course, fallen into disuse, it is known, that the priests still employed the hieroglyphical characters, as a sacred kind of Writing, now become peculiar to themselves, and serving to give an air of mystery to their learning and religion. In this state, the Greeks found hieroglyphical Writing, when they began to have inter­course with Egypt; and some of their writers mistook this use, to which they found it ap­plied, for the cause that had given rise to the invention.

AS Writing advanced, from pictures of visible objects, to hieroglyphics, or symbols of things invisible; from these latter, it vanced, among some nations, to simple ar­bitrary marks which stood for objects, though without any resemblance or analogy to the objects signified. Of this nature was the  method of Writing practised among the Pe­ruvians. They made use of small cords, of different colours; and by knots upon these, of various sizes, and differently ranged, they contrived signs for giving information, and communicating their thoughts to one ano­ther.

OF this nature also, are the written cha­racters, which are used to this day, through­out the great empire of China. The Chinese have no alphabet of letters, or simple sounds, which compose their words. But every sin­gle character which they use in Writing, is significant of an idea; it is a mark which stands for some one thing, or object. By consequence, the number of these characters must be immense. It must correspond to the whole number of objects, or ideas, which they have occasion to express; that is, to the whole number of words which they employ in Speech: nay, it must be greater than the number of words; one word, by varying the tone, with which it is spoken, may be made to signify several different things. They are said to have seventy thousand of those writ­ten characters. To read and write them to perfection, is the study of a whole life; which subjects learning, among them, to infinite disadvantage; and must have greatly retard the progress of all science.

CONCERNING the origin of these Chinese characters, there have been different opini­ons,  and much controversy. According to the most probable accounts, the Chinese Wri­ting began, like the Egyptian, with pictures, and hieroglyphical figures. These figures being, in progress, abbreviated in their form, for the sake of writing them easily, and great­ly enlarged in their number, passed, at length, into those marks or characters which they now use, and which have spread themselves through several nations of the East. For we are informed, that the Japanese, the Tonqui­nese, and the Coroeans, who speak different languages from one another, and from the inhabitants of China, use, however, the same written characters with them; and, by this means, correspond intelligibly with each other in Writing, though ignorant of the Language spoken in their several countries; a plain proof, that the Chinese characters are, like hieroglyphics, independent of Language; are signs of things, not of words.

WE have one instance of this sort of Wri­ting in Europe. Our cyphers, as they are called, or arithmetical figures, 1, 2, 3, 4,   which we have derived from the Arabi­ans, are significant marks, precisely of the same nature with the Chinese characters. They have no dependence on words; but each figure represents an object; represents the number for which it stands; and, ac­cordingly, on being presented to the eye, is equally understood by all the nations who have agreed in the use of these cyphers; by  Italians, Spaniards, French, and English, however different the Languages of those nations are from one another, and whatever different names they give, in their respective Languages, to each numerical cypher.

AS far, then, as we have yet advanced, nothing has appeared which resembles our letters, or which can be called Writing, in the sense we now give to that term. What we have hitherto seen, were all direct signs for things, and made no use of the medium of sound, or words; either signs by repre­sentation, as the Mexican pictures; or signs by analogy, as the Egyptian hieroglyphics; or signs by institution, as the Peruvian knots, the Chinese characters, and the A­rabian cyphers.

AT length, in different nations, men be­came sensible of the imperfection, the ambi­guity, and the tediousness of each of these methods of communication with one ano­ther. They began to consider, that by em­ploying signs which should stand not directly for things, but for the words which they used in Speech for naming these things, a consi­derable advantage would be gained. For they reflected farther, that though the num­ber of words in every Language be, indeed, very great, yet the number of articulate sounds, which are used in composing these words, is comparatively small. The same simple sounds are continually recurring and  repeated; and are combined together, in va­rious ways, for forming all the variety of words which we utter. They bethought themselves, therefore, of inventing signs, not for each word, by itself, but for each of those simple sounds which we employ in forming our words; and, by joining together a few of those signs, they saw that it would be practi­cable to express, in Writing, the whole com­binations of sounds which our words re­quire.

THE first step, in this new progress, was the invention of an alphabet of syllables, which probably preceded the invention of an alphabet of letters, among some of the an­tient nations; and which is said to be retain  to this day, in Aethiopia, and some coun­tries of India. By fixing upon a particular mark, or character, for every syllable in the Language, the number of characters, neces­sary to be used in Writing, was reduced within a much smaller compass than the number of words in the Language. Still, however, the number of characters was great; and must have continued to render both reading and writing very laborious arts. Till, at last, some happy genius arose; and tracing the sounds made by the human voice, to their most simple elements, reduced them to a very few vowels and consonants; and, by affixing to each of these the signs which we now call Letters, taught men how, by their combinations, to put into Writing all  the different words, or combinations of sound, which they employed in Speech. By being reduced to this simplicity, the art of Writing was brought to its highest state of perfection; and, in this state, we now enjoy it in all the countries of Europe.

TO whom we are indebted for this sublime and refined discovery, does not appear. Con­cealed by the darkness of remote antiquity, the great inventor is deprived of those ho­nours which would still be paid to his me­mory, by all the lovers of knowledge and learning. It appears from the books which Moses has written, that, among the Jews, and probably among the Egyptians, letters had been invented prior to his age. The uni­versal tradition among the antients is, that they were first imported into Greece by Cad­mus the Phoenician; who, according to the common system of chronology, was contem­porary with Joshua; according to Sir Isaac Newton system, contemporary with King David. As the Phoenicians are not known to have been the inventors of any art or sci­ence, though, by means of their extensive commerce, they propagated the discoveries made by other nations, the most probable and natural account of the origin of alpha­betical characters is, that they took rise in Egypt, the first civilized kingdom of which we have any authentic accounts, and the great source of arts and polity among the ancients. In that country, the favourite study  of hieroglyphical characters, had directed much attention to the art of Writing. Their hieroglyphics are known to have been inter­mixed with abbreviated symbols, and arbi­trary marks; whence, at last, they caught the idea of contriving marks, not for things merely, but for sounds. Accordingly, Plato (in Phoedro) expressly attributes the invention of letters to Theuth, the Egyptian, who is supposed to have been the Hermes, or Mer­cury, of the Greeks. Cadmus himself, though he passed from Phoenicia to Greece, yet is affirmed, by several of the antients, to have been originally of Thebes in Egypt. Most probably, Moses carried with him the Egyp­tian letters into the land of Canaan; and there being adopted by the Phoenicians, who inhabited part of that country, they were transmitted into Greece.

THE alphabet which Cadmus brought into Greece was imperfect, and is said to have contained only sixteen letters. The rest were afterwards added, according as signs for pro­per sounds were found to be wanting. It is curious to observe, that the letters which we use at this day, can be traced back to this very alphabet of Cadmus. The Roman al­phabet, which obtains with us, and with most of the European nations, is plainly formed on the Greek, with a few variations. And all learned men observe, that the Greek cha­racters, especially according to the manner in which they are formed in the oldest inscrip­tions,  have a remarkable conformity with the Hebrew or Samaritan characters, which, it is agreed, are the same with the Phoenician, or the alphabet of Cadmus. Invert the Greek characters from left to right, according to the Phoenician and Hebrew manner of Writing, and they are nearly the same. Besides the conformity of figure, the names or denomi­nations of the letters, alpha, beta, gamma,   and the order in which the letters are arranged, in all the several alphabets, Phoe­nician, Hebrew, Greek, and Roman, agree so much, as amounts to a demonstration, that they were all derived originally from the same source. An invention so useful and simple, was greedily received by mankind, and pro­pagated with speed and facility through many different nations.

THE letters were, originally, written from the right hand towards the left; that is, in a contrary order to what we now practise. This manner of Writing obtained among the Assy­rians, Phoenicians, Arabians, and Hebrews; and from some very old inscriptions, appears to have obtained also among the Greeks. Afterwards, the Greeks adopted a new me­thod, writing their lines alternately from the right to the left, and from the left to the right, which was called Boustrophedon; or, writing after the manner in which oxen plow the ground. Of this, several specimens still remain; particularly, the inscription on the famous Sigaean monument; and down to the  days of Solon, the legislator of Athens, this continued to be the common method of Wri­ting. At length, the motion from the left hand to the right being found more natural and commodious, the practice of Writing, in this direction, prevailed throughout all the countries of Europe.

WRITING was long a kind of engraving. Pillars, and tables of stone, were first em­ployed for this purpose, and afterwards, plates of the softer metals, such as lead. In pro­portion as Writing became more common, lighter and more portable substances were employed. The leaves, and the bark of cer­tain trees, were used in some countries; and in others, tablets of wood, covered with a thin coat of soft wax, on which the impres­sion was made with a stylus of iron. In later times, the hides of animals, properly prepared and polished into parchment, were the most common materials. Our present method of writing on paper, is an invention of no great­er antiquity than the fourteenth century.

THUS I have given some account of the Progress of these two great arts, Speech and Writing; by which men thoughts are com­municated, and the foundation laid for all knowledge and improvement. Let us con­clude the subject, with comparing, in a few words, spoken Language, and written Lan­guage; or words uttered in our hearing, with words represented to the eye; where we shall  find several advantages and disadvantages to be balanced on both sides.

THE advantages of Writing above Speech are, that Writing is both a more extensive, and a more permanent method of communi­cation. More extensive; as it is not con­fined within the narrow circle of those who hear our words, but, by means of written characters, we can send our thoughts abroad, and propagate them through the world; we can lift our voice, so as to speak to the most distant regions of the earth. More perma­nent also; as it prolongs this voice to the most distant ages; it gives us the means of record our sentiments to futurity, and of perpe­tuating the instructive memory of past tran­sactions. It likewise affords this advantage to such as read, above such as hear, that, having the written characters before their eyes, they can arrest the sense of the writer. They can pause, and revolve, and compare, at their leisure, one passage with another; whereas, the voice is fugitive and passing; you must catch the words the moment they are uttered, or you lose them for ever.

BUT, although these be so great advan­tages of written Language, that Speech, with­out Writing, would have been very inade­quate for the instruction of mankind; yet we must not forget to observe, that spoken Language has a great superiority over written Language, in point of energy or force. The  voice of the living Speaker, makes an im­pression on the mind, much stronger than can be made by the perusal of any Writing. The tones of voice, the looks and gesture, which accompany discourse, and which no Writing can convey, render discourse, when it is well managed, infinitely more clear, and more expressive, than the most accurate Writing. For tones, looks, and gestures, are natural interpreters of the sentiments of the mind. They remove ambiguities; they enforce im­pressions; they operate on us by means of sympathy, which is one of the most power­ful instruments of persuasion. Our sympa­thy is always awakened more, by hearing the Speaker, than by reading his works in our closet. Hence, though Writing may answer the purposes of mere instruction, yet all the great and high efforts of eloquence must be made, by means of spoken, not of written, Language.

LECTURE  STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE.

AFTER having given an account of the Rise and Progress of Language, I pro­ceed to treat of its Structure, or of General Grammar. The Structure of Language is extremely artificial; and there are few sci­ences, in which a deeper, or more refined lo­gic, is employed, than in Grammar. It is apt to be slighted by superficial thinkers, as be­longing to those rudiments of knowledge, which were inculcated upon us in our earliest youth. But what was then inculcated before we could comprehend its principles, would abundantly repay our study in maturer years; and to the ignorance of it, must be attribut many of those fundamental defects which appear in writing.

FEW authors have written with philoso­phical accuracy on the principles of General Grammar; and, what is more to be regret­ted,  fewer still have thought of applying those principles to the English Language. While the French Tongue has long been an object of attention to many able and ingenious wri­ters of that nation, who have considered its construction, and determined its propriety with great accuracy, the Genius and Gram­mar of the English, to the reproach of the country, have not been studied with equal care, or ascertained with the same precision. Attempts have been made, indeed, of late, towards supplying this defect; and some able writers have entered on the subject; but much remains yet to be done.

I DO not propose to give any system, either of Grammar in general, or of English Gram­mar in particular. A minute discussion of the niceties of Language would carry us too much off from other objects, which demand our attention in this course of Lectures. But I propose to give a general view of the chief principles relating to this subject, in observa­tions on the several parts of which Speech or Language is composed; remarking, as I go along, the peculiarities of our own Tongue. After which, I shall make some more particu­lar remarks on the Genius of the English Language.

THE first thing to be considered, is, the division of the several parts of Speech. The essential parts of Speech are the same in all Languages. There must always be some  words which denote the names of objects, or mark the subject of discourse; other words, which denote the qualities of those objects, and express what we affirm concern them; and other words, which point out their connections and relations. Hence, sub­stantives, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, prepo­sitions, and conjunctions, must necessarily be found in all Languages. The most simple and comprehensive division of the parts of Speech is, into substantives, attributives, and connectives*. Substantives, are all the words which express the names of objects, or the subjects of discourse; attributives, are all the words which express any attribute, property, or action of the former; connectives, are what express the connections, relations, and dependencies, which take place among them. The common grammatical division of Speech into eight parts; nouns, pronouns, verbs, par­ticiples, adverbs, prepositions, interjections, and conjunctions, is not very logical, as might be easily shewn; as it comprehends,  under the general term of nouns, both sub­stantives and adjectives, which are parts of Speech generically and essentially distinct; while it makes a separate part of speech of participles, which are no other than verbal adjectives. However, as these are the terms to which our ears have been most familiaris  and, as an exact logical division is of no great consequence to our present purpose, it will be better to make use of these known terms than of any other.

WE are naturally led to begin with the consideration of substantive nouns, which are the foundation of all Grammar, and may be considered as the most ancient part of Speech. For, assuredly, as soon as men had got beyond simple interjections, or exclama­tions of passion, and began to communicate themselves by discourse, they would be under a necessity of assigning names to the objects they saw around them; which, in Grammati­cal Language, is called, the Invention of substantive nouns*. And here, at our first  setting out, somewhat curious occurs. The individual objects which surround us, are infinite in number. A savage, wherever he looked, beheld forests and trees. To give separate names to every one of these trees, would have been an endless and impractica­ble undertaking. His first object was, to give a name to that particular tree, whose fruit relieved his hunger, or whose shade protected him from the sun. But observing, that though other trees were distinguished from this by peculiar qualities of size or ap­pearance, yet, that they also agreed and re­sembled one another, in certain common qualities, such as springing from a root, and bearing branches and leaves, he formed, in his mind, some general idea of those common qualities, and ranging all that possessed them under one class of objects, he called that whole class, a tree. Longer experience  taught him to subdivide this genus into the several species of oak, pine, ash, and the rest, according as his observation extended to the several qualities in which these trees agreed or differed.

BUT, still, he made use only of general terms in Speech. For the oak, the pine, and the ash, were names of whole classes of ob­jects; each of which included an immense number of undistinguished individuals. Here then, it appears, that though the formation of abstract, or general conceptions, is sup­posed to be a difficult operation of the mind; such conceptions must have entered into the very first formation of Language. For, if we except only the proper names of persons, such as Caesar, John, Peter, all the other sub­stantive nouns which we employ in discourse, are the names, not of individual objects, but of very extensive genera, or species of ob­jects; as, man, lion, house, river,   We are not, however, to imagine, that this in­vention of general, or abstract terms, re­quires any great exertion of metaphysical capacity: For, by whatever steps the mind proceeds in it, it is certain, that, when men have once observed resemblances among ob­jects, they are naturally inclined to call all those which resemble one another, by one common name; and of course, to class them under one species. We may daily observe this practised by children, in their first at­tempts towards acquiring Language.

 BUT now, after Language had proceeded as far as I have described, the notification which it made of objects was still very im­perfect: For, when one mentioned to ano­ther, in discourse, any substantive noun; such as, man, lion, or tree, how was it to be known which man, which lion, or which tree he meant, among the many comprehend under one name? Here occurs a very curious, and a very useful contrivance for specifying the individual object intended, by means of that part of Speech called, the Ar­ticle.

THE force of the Article consists, in point  or singling out from the common mass, the individual of which we mean to speak. In English, we have two Articles, a and the; a is more general and unlimited; the more definite and special. A is much the same with one, and marks only any one individual of a species; that individual being either un­known, or left undertermined; as, a lion, a king. The, which possesses more properly the force of the Article, ascertains some known or determined individual of the spe­cies; as, the lion, the king.

ARTICLES are words of great use in Speech. In some Languages, however, they are not found. The Greeks have but one Article, [...] which answers to our definite, or pro­per Article, the. They have no word which answers to our Article a; but they supply its  place by the absence of their Article: Thus, [...] signifies, a king; [...], the king The Latins have no Article. In the room of it, they employ pronouns, as, hic, ille, iste, for pointing out the objects which they want to distinguish. Noster sermo, says Quinc­tilian, articulos non desiderat, ideoque in alias partes orationis sparguntur. This, however, appears to me a defect in the Latin tongue; as Articles contribute much to the clearness and precision of Language.

IN order to illustrate this, remark, what difference there is in the meaning of the fol­lowing expressions in English, depending wholly on the different employment of the Articles: The son of a king. ”The son of the king ”A son of the king Each of these three phrases has an entirely different meaning, which I need not explain, because any one who understands the Language, con­ceives it clearly at first hearing, through the different application of the Articles, a and the. Whereas, in Latin, Filius regis, is wholly undetermined; and to explain, in which of these three senses it is to be under­stood, for it may bear any of them, a cir­cumlocution of several words must be used. In the same manner, Are you a king? Are you the king? are questions of quite separate import; which, however, are con­founded together in the Latin phrase, esne tu rex? Thou art a man, is a very general and harmless position; but, thou  art the man, is an assertion, capable, we know, of striking terror and remorse into the heart. These observations illustrate the force and importance of Articles: And, at the same time, I gladly lay hold of any opportu­nity of shewing the advantages of our own Language.

BESIDES this quality of being particularised by the Articie, three affections belong to sub­stantive nouns, number, gender, and case, which require our consideration.

NUMBER distinguishes them as one, or many, of the same kind, called the Singular and Plural; a distinction found in all Lan­guages, and which must, indeed, have been coÃ«val with the very infancy of Language; as there were few things which men had more frequent occasion to express, than the differ­ence between one and many. For the grea­ter facility of expressing it, it has, in all Lan­guages, been marked by some variation made upon the substantive noun; as we see, in English, our plural is commonly formed by the addition of the letter  In the Hebrew, Greek, and some other ancient Languages, we find, not only a plural, but a dual num­ber; the rise of which may very naturally be accounted for, from separate terms of num­bering not being yet invented, and one, two, and many, being all, or, at least, the chief numeral distinctions which men, at first, had any occasion to take notice of.

 GENDER, is an affection of substantive nouns, which will lead us into more discus­sion than number. Gender, being founded on the distinction of the two sexes, it is plain, that, in a proper sense, it can only find place in the names of living creatures, which admit the distinction of male and fe­male; and, therefore, can be ranged under the masculine or feminine genders. All other substantive nouns ought to belong, to what grammarians call, the Neuter Gender, which is meant to imply the negation of either sex. But, with respect to this distribution, some­what singular hath obtained in the structure of Language. For, in correspondence to that distinction of male and female sex, which runs through all the classes of animals, men have, in most Languages, ranked a great number of inaminate objects also, under the like distinctions of masculine and feminine. Thus we find it, both in the Greek and tin Tongues. Gladius, a sword, for instance, is masculine; sagitta, an arrow, is feminine; and this assignation of sex to inanimate ob­jects, this distinction of them into masculine and feminine, appears often to be entirely capricious; derived from no other principle than the casual structure of the Language, which refers to a certain gender, words of a certain termination. In the Greek and tin, however, all inanimate objects are not distributed into masculine and feminine; but many of them are also classed, where all of  them ought to have been, under the neuter gender; as, templum, a church; sedile, a seat.

BUT the genius of the French and Italian Tongues differs, in this respect, from the Greek and Latin. In the French and Italian, from whatever cause it has happened, so it is, that the neuter gender is wholly unknown, and that all their names of inanimate objects are put upon the same footing with living creatures; and distributed, without excepti­on, into masculine and feminine. The French have two articles, the masculine le, and the feminine  and one or other of these is prefixed to all substantive nouns in the Lan­guage, to denote their gender. The Italians make the same universal use of their articles il and lo, for the masculine; and  for the feminine.

IN the English Language, it is remarkable that there obtains a peculiarity quite oppo­site. In the French and Italian, there is no neuter gender. In the English, when we use common discourse, all substantive nouns, that are not names of living creatures, are neuter, without exception. He, she, and it, are the marks of the three genders; and we always use it, in speaking of any object where there is no sex, or where the sex is not known. The English is, perhaps, the only Language in the known world (except the Chinese, which is said to agree with it in this parti­cular), where the distinction of gender is pro­perly  and philosophically applied in the use of words, and confined, as it ought to be, to mark the real distinctions of male and fe­male.

HENCE arises a very great and signal vantage of the English Tongue, which it is of consequence to remark*. Though in common discourse, as I have already observ  we employ only the proper and literal distinction of sexes; yet the genius of the Language permits us, whenever it will add beauty to our discourse, to make the names of inanimate objects masculine or feminine in a metaphorical sense; and when we do so, we are understood to quit the literal style, and to use one of the figures of discourse.

FOR instance; if I am speaking of virtue, in the course of ordinary conversation, or of strict reasoning, I refer the word to no sex or gender; I say, Virtue is its own reward; or, it is the law of our nature. But if I chuse to rise into a higher tone; if I seek to embellish and animate my discourse, I give a sex to virtue; I say, She descends from Heaven; she alone confers true honour upon man; her gifts are the only dura­ble rewards. By this means, we have it in our power to vary our style at pleasure.  By making a very slight alteration, we can personify any object that we chuse to intro­duce with dignity; and by this change of manner, we give warning, that we are pas­sing from the strict and logical, to the orna­mented and rhetorical style.

THIS is an advantage which, not only every poet, but every good writer and speak­er in prose, is, on many occasions, glad to lay hold of, and improve: and it is an advantage peculiar to our Tongue; no other Language possesses it. For, in other Languages, every word has one fixed gender, masculine, femi­mine, or neuter, which can, upon no occa­sion, be changed; [...] for instance, in Greek, virtus in Latin, and vertu in French, are uniformly feminine. She, must always be the pronoun answering to the word, whether you be writing in poetry or prose, whether you be using the style of reasoning, or that of declamation: whereas, in English, we can either express ourselves with the philosophical accuracy of giving no gender to things inani­mate; or by giving them gender, and trans­forming them into persons, we adapt them to the style of poetry, and, when it is proper, we enliven prose.

IT deserves to be further remarked on this subject, that, when we employ that liberty which our Language allows, of ascribing sex to any inanimate object, we have not, how­ever, the liberty of making it of what gender  we please, masculine or feminine; but are, in general, subjected to some rule of gender which the currency of Language has fixed to that object. The foundation of that rule is imagined, by Mr. Harris, in his Philoso­phical Enquiry into the Principles of Gram­mar, to be laid in a certain distant resem­blance, or analogy, to the natural distinction of the two sexes.

THUS, according to him, we commonly give the masculine gender to those substan­tive nouns used figuratively, which are con­spicuous for the attributes of imparting, or communicating; which are by nature strong and efficacious, either to good or evil; or which have a claim to some eminence, whe­ther laudable or not. Those again, he ima­gines, to be generally made feminine, which are conspicuous for the attributes of contain  and of bringing forth; which have more of the passive in their nature, than the ac­tive; which are peculiarly beautiful, or amia­ble; or which have respect to such excesses as are rather feminine than masculine. Upon these principles he takes notice, that the sun is always put in the masculine gender with us; the moon in the feminine, as being the receptacle of the sun light. The earth is, universally, feminine. A ship, a country, a city, are likewise made feminine, as receiv­ers, or containers. God, in all Languages, is masculine. Time, we make masculine, on account of its mighty efficacy; virtue, femi­nine,  from its beauty, and its being the ob­ject of love. Fortune is always feminine. Mr. Harris imagines, that the reasons which determine the gender of such capital words as these, hold in most other Languages, as well as the English. This, however, appears doubtful. A variety of circumstances, which seem casual to us, because we cannot reduce them to principles, must, unquestionably, have influenced the original formation of Languages; and in no article whatever does Language appear to have been more capri­cious, and to have proceeded less according to fixed rule, than in the imposition of gen­der upon things inanimate; especially among such nations as have applied the distinction of masculine and feminine to all substantive nouns.

HAVING discussed gender, I proceed, next, to another remarkable peculiarity of substan­tive nouns, which, in the style of grammar, is called, their declension by cases. Let us, first, consider what cases signify. In order to understand this, it is necessary to observe, that, after men had given names to external objects, had particularised them by means of the article, and distinguished them by num­ber and gender, still their Language remain extremely imperfect, till they had devised some method of expressing the relations which those objects bore, one towards another. They would find it of little use to have a name for man, lion, tree, river, without be  able, at the same time, to signify how these stood with respect to each other; whe­ther, as approaching to, receding from, join with, and the like. Indeed, the relations which objects bear to one another, are im­mensely numerous; and therefore, to devise names for them all, must have been among the last and most difficult refinements of Language. But, in its most early periods, it was absolutely necessary to express, in some way or other, such relations as were most important, and as occurred most frequently in common Speech. Hence the genitive, da­tive, and ablative cases of nouns, which ex­press the noun itself, together with those re­lations, of, to, from, with, and by; the rela­tions which, of all others, we have the most frequent occasion to mention. The proper idea then of cases in declension, is no other than an expression of the state, or relation, which one object bears to another, denoted by some variation made upon the name of that object; most commonly in the final let­ters, and by some Languages, in the initial.

ALL Languages, however, do not agree in this mode of expression. The Greek, tin, and several other Languages, use declen­sion. The English, French, and Italian, do not; or, at most, use it very imperfectly. In place of the variations of cases, these modern Tongues express the relations of objects, by means of the words called Prepositions, which are the names of those relations, prefixed to  the name of the object. English nouns have no case whatever, except a sort of genitive, commonly formed by the addition of the let­ter to the noun; as when we say Dryden Poems, meaning the Poems of Dryden. Our personal pronouns have also a case, which answers to the accusative of the Latin, I, me, ”he, him, ”who, whom. There is nothing, then, or at least very little, in the Grammar of our Language, which corresponds to clension in the ancient Languages.

TWO questions, respecting this subject, may be put. First, Which of these methods of expressing relations, whether that by clension, or that by prepositions, was the most ancient usage in Language? And next, Which of them has the best effect? Both methods, it is plain, are the same as to the sense, and differ only in form. For the sig­nificancy of the Roman Language would not have been altered, though the nouns, like ours, had been without cases, provided they had employed prepositions; and though, to express a disciple of Plato, they had said, Discipulus Plato, like the modern Ita­lians, in place of Discipulus Platonis.

NOW, with respect to the antiquity of cases, although they may, on first view, seem to constitute a more artificial method than the other, of denoting relations, yet there are strong reasons for thinking that this was the earliest method practised by men. We find,  in fact, that declensions and cases are used in most of what are called the Mother Tongues, or Original Languages, as well as in the Greek and Latin. And a very natural and satis­fying account can be given why this usage should have early obtained. Relations are the most abstract and metaphysical ideas of any which men have occasion to form, when they are considered by themselves, and se­parated from the related object. It would puzzle any man, as has been well observed by an Author on this subject, to give a dis­tinct account of what is meant by such a word as of, or from, when it stands by itself, and to explain all that may be included under it. The first rude inventors of Language, therefore, would be long of arriving at such general terms. In place of considering any relation in the abstract, and devising a name for it, they would much more easily conceive it in conjunction with a particular object; and they would express their conceptions of it, by varying the name of that object through all the different cases; hominis, of a man; ho­mini, to a man; homine, with a man,  

BUT, though this method of declension was, probably, the only method which men employed, at first, for denoting relations, yet, in progress of time, many other relations be observed, besides those which are signi­fied by the cases of nouns, and men also be­coming more capable of general and meta­physical ideas, separate names were gradually  invented for all the relations which occurred, forming that part of Speech which we now call Prepositions. Prepositions being once introduced, they were found to be capable of supplying the place of cases, by being prefix to the nominative of the noun. Hence, it came to pass, that, as nations were inter­mixed by migrations and conquests, and were obliged to learn, and adopt the Languages of one another, prepositions supplanted the use of cases and declensions. When the Italian Tongue, for instance, sprung out of the Ro­man, it was found more easy and simple, by the Gothic nations, to accommodate a few prepositions to the nominative of every noun, and to say, di Roma, al Roma, di Carthago, al Carthago, than to remember all the variety of terminations, Romae, Romam, Carthaginis, Carthaginem, which the use of declensions required in the ancient nouns. By this pro­gress we can give a natural account how nouns, in our modern Tongues, come to be so void of declension: A progress which is fully illustrated in Dr. Adam Smith ingeni­ous Dissertation on the Formation of Lan­guages.

WITH regard to the other question on this subject, Which of these two methods is of the greatest utility and beauty? we shall find advantages and disadvantages to be ba­lanced on both sides. There is no doubt that, by abolishing cases, we have rendered the structure of modern Languages more simple.  We have disembarrassed it of all the intricacy which arose from the different forms of clension, of which the Romans had no fewer than five; and from all the irregularities in these several declensions. We have thereby rendered our Languages more easy to be ac­quired, and less subject to the perplexity of rules. But, though the simplicity and ease of Language be great and estimable advan­tages, yet there are also such disadvantages attending the modern method, as leave the balance, on the whole, doubtful, or rather incline it to the side of antiquity.

FOR, in the first place, by our constant use of prepositions for expressing the relations of things, we have filled Language with a mul­titude of those little words, which are eter­nally occurring in every sentence, and may be thought thereby to have encumbered Speech, by an addition of terms; and by rendering it more prolix, to have enervated its force. In the second place, we have cer­tainly rendered the sound of Languge less agreeable to the ear, by depriving it of that variety and sweetness, which arose from the length of words, and the change of termina­tions, occasioned by the cases in the Greek and Latin. But, in the third place, the most material disadvantage is, that, by this aboli of cases, and by a similar alteration, of which I am to speak in the next Lecture, in he conjugation of verbs, we have deprived  ourselves of that liberty of transposition in the arrangement of words, which the Anti­ent Languages enjoyed.

IN the ancient Tongues, as I formerly ob­served, the different terminations, produced by declension and conjugation, pointed out the reference of the several words of a sentence to one another, without the aid of juxtapositi­on; suffered them to be placed, without am­biguity, in whatever order was most suited to give emphasis to the meaning, or harmo­ny to the sound. But now, having none of those marks of relation incorporated with the words themselves, we have no other way left us, of showing what words in a sentence are most closely connected in meaning, than that of placing them close by one another in thepe­riod. The meaning of the sentence is brought out in separate members and portions; it is broken down and divided. Whereas the structure of the Greek and Roman sentences, by the government of their nouns and verbs, presented the meaning so interwoven and compounded in all its parts, as to make us perceive it in one united view. The closing words of the period ascertained the relation of each member to another; and all that ought to be connected in our idea, appeared connected in the expression. Hence, more brevity, more vivacity, more force. That luggage of particles (as an ingenious Author happily expresses it), which we are obliged  always to carry along with us, both clogs style, and enfeebles sentiment*.

PRONOUNS are the class of words most nearly related to substantive nouns; being, as the name imports, representatives, or sub­stitutes, of nouns. I, thou, he, she, and it, are no other than an abridged way of nam the persons, or objects, with which we have immediate intercourse, or to which we are obliged frequently to refer in discourse. Accordingly, they are subject to the same modifications with substantive nouns, of number, gender, and case. Only, with re­spect to gender, we may observe, that the pronouns of the first and second person, as  they are called, I and thou, do not appear to have had the distinctions of gender given them in any Language; for this plain reason, that, as they always refer to persons who are present to each other, when they speak, their sex must appear, and therefore needs not be marked by a masculine or feminine pronoun. But, as the third person may be absent, or unknown, the distinction of gender there becomes necessary; and accordingly, in En­glish, it hath all the three genders belonging to it; he, she, it. As to cases; even those Languages which have dropped them in sub­stantive nouns, sometimes retain more of them in pronouns, for the sake of the greater readiness in expressing relations; as pronouns are words of such frequent occurrence in dis­course. In English, most of our grammari­ans hold the personal pronouns to have two cases, besides the nominative; a genitive, and an accusative, ”I, mine, me; ”thou, thine, thee; ”he, his, him; ”who, whose, whom.

IN the first stage of Speech, it is probable that the places of those pronouns were sup­plied, by pointing to the object when pre­sent, and naming it when absent. For one can hardly think that pronouns were of early invention; as they are words of such a par­ticular and artificial nature. I, thou, he, it, it is to be observed, are not names peculiar to any single object, but so very general, that they may be applied to all persons, or objects, whatever, in certain circumstances. It, is  the most general term that can possibly be conceived, as it may stand for any one thing in the universe, of which we speak. At the same time, these pronouns have this quality, that, in the circumstances in which they are applied, they never denote more than one precise individual; which they ascertain, and specify, much in the same manner as is done by the article. So that pronous are, at once, the most general, and the most particular words in Language. They are commonly the most irregular and troublesome words to the learner, in the Grammar of all Tongues; as being the words most in common use, and subjected thereby to the greatest varieties.

ADJECTIVES, or terms of quality, such as, great, little, black, white, yours, ours, are the plainest and simplest of all that class of words which are termed attributive. They are found in all Languages; and, in all Lan­guages, must have been very early invented; as objects could not be distinguished from each other, nor any intercourse be carried on concerning them, till once names were given to their different qualities.

I HAVE nothing to observe in relation to them, except that singularity which attends them in the Greek and Latin, of having the same form given them with substantive nouns; being declined, like them, by cases, and sub­jected to the like distinctions of number and gender. Whence it has happened, that gram­marians  have made them to belong to the same part of Speech, and divided the noun into substantive and adjective; an arrange­ment, founded more on attention to the ex­ternal form of words, than to their nature and force. For adjectives, or terms of qua­lity, have not, by their nature, the least re­semblance to substantive nouns, as they never express any thing which can possibly subsist by itself; which is the very essence of the substantive noun. They are, indeed, more a-kin to verbs, which, like them, express the attribute of some substance.

IT may, at first view, appear somewhat odd and fantastic, that adjectives should, in these ancient Languages, have assumed so much the form of substantives; since neither number, nor gender, nor cases, nor relations, have any thing to do, in a proper sense, with mere qualities, such as, good or great, soft or hard. And yet bonus, and magnus, and tener, have their singular and plural, their masculine and feminine, their genitives and datives, like any of the names of substances, or per­sons. But this can be accounted for, from the genius of those Tongues. They avoided, as much as possible, considering qualities se­parately, or in the abstract. They made them a part, or appendage, of the substance which they served to distinguish; they made the adjective depend on its substantive, and re­semble it in termination, in number, and gender, in order that the two might coalesce  the more intimately, and be joined in the form of expression, as they were in the na­ture of things. The liberty of transposition, too, which those Languages indulged, requir such a method as this to be followed. For, allowing the related words of a sentence to be placed at a distance from each other, it re­quired the relation of adjectives to their pro­per substantives to be pointed out, by such similar circumstances of form and termina  as, according to the grammatical style, should show their concordance. When I say, in English, the Beautiful wife of a brave man, the juxtaposition of the words pre­vents all ambiguity. But when I say, in tin, Formosa fortis viri uxor; it is only the agreement, in gender, number, and case, of the adjective formosa, which is the first word of the sentence, with the substantive uxor, which is the last word that declares the meaning.

LECTURE IX. STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE. ENGLISH TONGUE.

OF the whole class of words that are call attributive, indeed, of all the parts of Speech, the most complex, by far, is the verb. It is chiefly in this part of Speech, that the subtile and profound metaphysic of Language appears; and, therefore, in exa­mining the nature and different variations of the verb, there might be room for ample dis­cussion. But as I am sensible that such gram­matical discussions, when they are pursued far, become intricate and obscure, I shall avoid dwelling any longer on this subject, than seems absolutely necessary.

THE verb is so far of the same nature with the adjective, that it expresses, like it, an attribute, or propriety, of some person or thing. But it does more than this. For, in all verbs, in every Language, there are no  less than three things implied at once; the attribute of some substantive, an affirmation concerning that attribute, and time. Thus, when I say, the sun shineth. Shining, is the attribute ascribed to the sun; the present time is marked; and an affirmation is in­cluded, that this property of shining belongs, at that time, to the sun. The participle, shining, is merely an adjective, which notes an attribute, or property, and also ex­presses time; but carries no affirmation. The infinitive mood, to shine, may be called the name of the verb; it carries neither time nor affirmation; but simply expresses that attribute, action, or state of things, which is to be the subject of the other moods and tenses. Hence the infinitive is often a-kin to a substantive noun; and, both in English and Latin, is sometimes constructed as such. As, Scire tuum nihil est. Dulce et deco­rum est pro patria mori. And, in English, in the same manner. To write well is difficult; to speak eloquently is still more difficult. But as, through all the other tenses and moods, the affirmation runs, and is essential to them; the sun shineth, was shining, shone, will shine, would have shone,   the affirmation seems to be that which chiefly distinguishes the verb from the other parts of Speech, and gives it its most conspicuous power. Hence there can be no sentence or complete proposition, with­out a verb either expressed or implied. For, whenever we speak, we always mean to assert,  that something is, or is not; and the word which carries this assertion, or affirmation, is a verb. From this sort of eminence belonging to it, this part of Speech hath received its name; verb, from the Latin, verbum, or the word, by way of distinction."
"VERBS, therefore, from their importance and necessity in Speech, must have been coÃ«­val with men first attempts towards the formation of Language: Though, indeed, it must have been the work of long time, to rear them up to that accurate and complex structure, which they now possess. It seems very probable, as Dr. Smith hath suggested, that the radical verb, or the first form of it, in most Languages, would be, what we now call, the Impersonal Verb. It rains; it thunders; it is light; it is agreeable; and the like; as this is the very simplest form of the verb, and merely affirms the existence of an event, or of a state of things. By grees, after pronouns were invented, such verbs became personal, and were branched out into all the variety of tenses and moods."
"THE tenses of the verb are contrived to imply the several distinctions of time. Of these, I must take some notice, in order to show the admirable accuracy with which Language is constructed. We think, com­monly, of no more than the three great di­visions of time, into the past, the present, and the future: and we might imagine, that  if verbs had been so contrived, as simply to express these, no more was needful. But Language proceeds with much greater sub­tilty. It splits time into its several moments. It considers time as never standing still, but always flowing; things past, as more or less perfectly completed; and things future, as more or less remote, by different gradations. Hence the great variety of tenses in most Tongues."
"THE present may, indeed, be always con­sidered as one indivisible point, susceptible of no variety. I write, or, I am writing; scribo. But it is not so with the past. There is no Language so poor, but it hath two or three tenses to express the varieties of it. Ours hath no fewer than four. 1. A past action may be considered as left unfi­nished; which makes the imperfect tense, I was writing; scribebam. 2. As just now finished. This makes the proper perfect tense, which, in English, is always expressed by the help of the auxiliary verb, I have written. 3. It may be considered as fi­nished some time ago; the particular time left indefinite. I wrote; scripsi; which may either signify, I wrote yesterday, or I wrote a twelvemonth ago. This is what grammarians call an aÃ¶rist, or indefinite past. 4. It may be considered as finished before something else, which is also past. This is the plusquamperfect. I had written; scrip­seram.  I had written before I received his letter."
"HERE we observe, with some pleasure, that we have an advantage over the Latins, who have only three varieties upon the past time. They have no proper perfect tense, or one which distinguishes an action just now finished, from an action that was finished some time ago. In both these cases, they must say, scripsi. Though there be a ma­nifest difference in the tenses, which our Language expresses, by this variation, I have written, meaning, I have just now finished writing; and, I wrote, meaning at some former time, since which, other things have intervened. This difference the Ro­mans have no tense to express; and, there­fore, can only do it by a circumlocution."
"THE chief varieties in the future time are two; a simple or indefinite future: I shall write; scribam: And a future, relating to something else, which is also future. I shall have written; scripsero. I shall have written before he arrives*."
"BESIDES tenses, or the power of expres­sing time, verbs admit the distinction of Voices, as they are called, the active and  the passive; according as the affirmation re­spects something that is done, or something that is suffered; I love, or I am loved. They admit also the distinction of moods, which are designed to express the affirma  whether active or passive, under differ­ent forms. The indicative mood, for in­stance, simply declares a proposition, I write; I have written; the imperative re­quires, commands, threatens, write thou; let him write. The subjunctive expresses the proposition under the form of a condi  or in subordination to some other thing, to which a reference is made, I might write, I could write, I should write, if the case were so and so. This manner of expres­sing an affirmation, under so many different forms, together also with the distinction of the three persons, I, thou, and he, constitutes what is called, the conjugation of verbs, which makes so great a part of the grammar of all Languages."
"IT now clearly appears, as I before observ  that, of all the parts of Speech, verbs are, by far, the most artificial and complex. Consider only, how many things are denoted by this single Latin word amavissem, I would have loved. First, The person who speaks, I. Secondly, An attribute, or action of that person, loving. Thirdly, An affir­mation concerning that action. Fourthly, The past time denoted in that affirmation, have loved: and, Fifthly, A condition on  which the action is suspended, would have loved. It appears curious and remarkable, that words of this complex import, and with more or less of this artifical structure, are to be found, as far as we know, in all Languages of the world."
"INDEED, the form of conjugation, or the manner of expressing all these varieties in the verb, differs greatly in different Tongues. Conjugation is esteemed most perfect in those Languages, which, by varying either the ter­mination or the initial syllable of the verb, express the greatest number of important cir­cumstances, without the help of auxiliary words. In the Oriental Tongues, the verbs are said to have few tenses, or expressions of time; but then their moods are so con­trived, as to express a great variety of cir­cumstances and relations. In the Hebrew, for instance, they say, in one word, without the help of any auxiliary, not only I have taught, but, I have taught exactly, or often; I have been commanded to teach; I have taught myself. The Greek, which is the most perfect of all the known Tongues, is very regular and complete in all the tenses and moods. The Latin is formed on the same model, but more imperfect; especially in the passive voice, which forms most of the tenses by the help of the auxiliary sum."
"IN all the modern European Tongues, con­jugation is very defective. They admit few  varieties in the termination of the verb itself; but have almost constant recourse to their auxiliary verbs, throughout all the moods and tenses, both active and passive. Lan­guage has undergone a change in conjugation, perfectly similar to that which, I showed in the last Lecture, it underwent with respect to declension. As prepositions, prefixed to the noun, superseded the use of cases; so the two great auxiliary verbs, to have, and to be, with those other auxiliaries which we use in English, do, shall, will, may, and can, pre­fixed to the participle, supersede, in a great measure, the different terminations of moods and tenses, which formed the ancient conju­gations."
"THE alteration, in both cases, was owing to the same cause, and will be easily under­stood, from reflecting on what was formerly observed. The auxiliary verbs are like pre­positions, words of a very general and ab­stract nature. They imply the different mo­difications of simple existence, considered alone, and without reference to any parti­cular thing. In the early state of Speech, the import of them would be incorporated, so to speak, with every particular verb in its tenses and moods, long before words were invented for denoting such abstract concep­tions of existence, alone, and by themselves. But after those auxiliary verbs came, in the progress of Language, to be invented and known, and to have tenses and moods given  to them like other verbs; it was found, that as they carried in their nature the force of that affirmation which distinguishes the verb, they might, by being joined with the parti­ciple which gives the meaning of the verb, supply the place of most of the moods and tenses. Hence, as the modern Tongues be­gan to rise out of the ruins of the ancient  this method established itself in the new form­ation of Speech. Such words, for instance; as, am, was, have, shall, being once familiar, it appeared more easy to apply these to any verb whatever; as, I am loved; I was loved; I have loved; than to remember that variety of terminations which were requisite in con­jugating the ancient verbs, amor, amabar, amavi,   Two or three varieties only, in the termination of the verb, were retained, as, love, loved, loving; and all the rest were dropt. The consequence, however, of this practice, was the same as that of abolishing declensions. It rendered Language more simple and easy in its structure; but withal, more prolix, and less graceful. This finishes all that seemed most necessary to be observed with respect to verbs."
"THE remaining parts of Speech, which are called the indeclinable parts, or that admit of no variations, will not detain as long."
"ADVERBS are the first that occur. These form a very numerous class of words in eve­ry Language, reducible, in general, to the  head of attributives; as they serve to modi­fy, or to denote some circumstance of an action, or of a quality, relative to its time, place, order, degree, and the other proper­ties of it, which we have occasion to specify. They are, for the most part, no more than an abridged mode of Speech, expressing, by one word, what might, by a circumlocution, be resolved into two or more words belong to the other parts of Speech. Exceed­ingly, for instance, is the same as, in a high degree; bravely, the same as, with bravery or valour; here, the same as, in this place; often, and seldom, the same as, for many and for few times: and so of the rest. Hence, adverbs may be conceived as of less necessity, and of later introduction into the system of Speech, than many other classes of words; and, accord­ingly, the great body of them are derived from other words formerly established in the Language."
"PREPOSITIONS and conjunctions, are words more essential to discourse than the greatest part of adverbs. They form that class of words, called Connectives, without which there could be no Language; serving to ex­press the relations which things bear to one another, their mutual influence, dependen­cies, and coherence; thereby joining words together into intelligible and significant pro­positions. Conjunctions are generally em­ployed for connecting sentences, or members  of sentences; as, and, because, although, and the like. Prepositions are employed for con­necting words, by showing the relation which one substantive noun bears to another; as, of, from, to, above, below,   Of the force of these I had occasion to speak before, when treating of the cases and declensions of sub­stantive nouns."
"IT is abundantly evident, that all these connective particles must be of the greatest use in Speech; seeing they point out the re­lations and transitions by which the mind passes from one idea to another. They are the foundation of all reasoning, which is no other thing than the connection of thoughts. And, therefore, though among barbarous nations, and in the rude uncivilised ages of the world, the stock of these words might be small, it must always have increased, as man­kind advanced in the arts of reasoning and reflection. The more any nation is improv by science, and the more perfect their Language becomes, we may naturally expect, that it will abound the more with connec­tive particles; expressing relations of things, and transitions of thought, which had escaped a grosser view. Accordingly, no Tongue is so full of them as the Greek, in consequence of the acute and subtile genius of that re­fined people. In every Language, much of the beauty and strength of it depends on the proper use of conjunctions, prepositions, and those relative pronouns, which also serve the  same purpose of connecting the different parts of discourse. It is the right, or wrong management of these, which chiefly makes discourse appear firm and compacted, or dis­jointed and loose; which causes it to march with a smooth and even pace, or with gouty and hobbling steps."
"I SHALL dwell no longer on the general construction of Language. Allow me, only, before I dismiss the subject, to observe, that dry and intricate as it may seem to some, it is, however, of great importance, and very nearly connected with the philosophy of the human mind. For, if Speech be the vehicle, or interpreter of the conceptions of our minds, an examination of its Structure and Progress cannot but unfold many things concerning the nature and progress of our conceptions themselves, and the operations of our facul­ties; a subject that is always instructive to man, Nequis, says Quinctilian, an au­thor of excellent judgment, nequis tan­quam parva fastidiat grammatices elementa. Non quia magnae sit operae consonantes a vocalibus discernere, easque in semivoca­lium numerum, mutarumque partiri, sed quia interiora velut sacri hujus adeuntibus, apparebit multa rerum subtilitas, quae non modo acuere ingenia puerilia, sed exercere altissimam quoque eruditionem ac scientiam possit*. 1. 4."
" LET us now come nearer to our own Lan­guage. In this, and the preceding Lecture, some observations have already been made on its Structure. But it is proper, that we should be a little more particular in the exa­mination of it."
"THE Language which is, at present, spoken throughout Great Britain, is neither the an­tient primitive Speech of the island, nor rived from it; but is altogether of foreign origin. The Language of the first inhabi­tants of our island, beyond doubt, was the Celtic, or Gaelic, common to them with Gaul; from which country, it appears, by many circumstances, that Great Britain was peopled. This Celtic Tongue, which is said to be very expressive and copious, and is, pro­bably, one of the most ancient Languages in the world, obtained once in most of the west­ern regions of Europe. It was the Language of Gaul, of Great Britain, of Ireland, and, very probably, of Spain also; till, in the course of those revolutions, which, by means of the conquests, first, of the Romans, and afterwards, of the northern nations, changed the government, speech, and, in a manner,  the whole face of Europe, this Tongue was gradually obliterated; and now subsists only in the mountains of Wales, in the Highlands of Scotland, and among the wild Irish. For the Irish, the Welch, and the Erse, are no other than different dialects of the same Tongue, the ancient Celtic."
"THIS, then, was the Language of the pri­mitive Britons, the first inhabitants, that we know of, in our island; and continued so till the arrival of the Saxons in England, in the year of our Lord 450; who, having conquer the Britons, did not intermix with them, but expelled them from their habitations, and drove them, together with their Language, into the mountains of Wales. The Saxons were one of those northern nations that over­ran Europe; and their Tongue, a dialect of the Gothic or Teutonic, altogether distinct from the Celtic, laid the foundation of the present English Tongue. With some inter­mixture of Danish, a Language, probably, from the same root with the Saxon, it con­tinued to be spoken throughout the southern part of the Island, till the time of William the Conqueror. He introduced his Norman or French as the Language of the court, which made a considerable change in the Speech of the nation; and the English, which was spoken afterwards, and continues to be spoken now, is a mixture of the ancient Saxon, and this Norman French, together with such new and foreign words as com­merce  and learning have, in progress of time, gradually introduced."
"THE history of the English Language can, in this manner, be clearly traced. The Lan­guage spoken in the low countries of Scot­land, is now, and has been for many centu­ries, no other than a dialect of the English. How, indeed, or by what steps, the ancient Celtic Tongue came to be banished from the Low Country in Scotland, and to make its retreat into the Highlands and Islands, can­not be so well pointed out, as how the like revolution was brought about in England. Whether the southernmost part of Scotland was once subject to the Saxons, and formed a part of the kingdom of Northumberland; or, whether the great number of English exiles that retreated into Scotland, upon the Norman conquest, and upon other occasions, introduced into that country their own Lan­guage, which afterwards, by the mutual in­tercourse of the two nations, prevailed over the Celtic, are uncertain and contested points, the discussion of which would lead us too far from our subject."
"FROM what has been said, it appears, that the Teutonic dialect is the basis of our pre­sent Speech. It has been imported among us in three different forms, the Saxon, the Danish, and the Norman; all which have mingled together in our Language. A very great number of our words too, are plainly  derived from the Latin. These, we had not directly from the Latin, but most of them, it is probable, entered into our Tongue through the channel of that Norman French, which William the Conqueror introduced. For, as the Romans had long been in full possession of Gaul, the Language spoken in that country, when it was invaded by the Franks and Normans, was a sort of corrupt Latin, mingled with Celtic, to which was given the name of Romanshe: and as the Franks and Normans did not, like the Saxons in England, expel the inhabitants, but, after their victories, mingled with them; the Lan­guage of the country became a compound of the Teutonic dialect imported by these con­querors, and of the former corrupted Latin. Hence, the French Language has always continued to have a very considerable affi­nity with the Latin; and hence, a great number of words of Latin origin, which were in use among the Normans in France, were introduced into our Tongue at the conquest; to which, indeed, many have since been ded, directly from the Latin, in consequence of the great diffusion of Roman literature throughout all Europe."
"FROM the influx of so many streams, from the junction of so many dissimilar parts, it naturally follows, that the English, like every compounded Language, must needs be some­what irregular. We cannot expect from it that correspondence of parts, that complete  analogy in structure, which may be found in those simpler Languages, which have been formed in a manner within themselves, and built on one foundation. Hence, as I before showed, it has but small remains of conju­gation or declension; and its syntax is nar­row, as there are few marks in the words themselves that can show their relation to each other, or, in the grammatical style, point out either their concordance, or their government, in the sentence. Our words having been brought to us from several dif­ferent regions, straggle, if we may so speak, asunder from each other; and do not coalesce so naturally in the structure of a sentence, as the words in the Greek and Roman Tongues."
"BUT these disadvantages, if they be such, of a compound Language, are balanced by other advantages that attend it; particularly, by the number and variety of words with which such a Language is likely to be en­riched. Few Languages are, in fact, more copious than the English. In all grave sub­jects especially, historical, critical, political, and moral, no writer has the least reason to complain of the barrenness of our Tongue. The studious reflecting genius of the people, has brought together great store of expressi­ons, on such subjects, from every quarter. We are rich too in the Language of poetry. Our poetical style differs widely from prose, not in point of numbers only, but in the ve­ry  words themselves; which shows what a stock and compass of words we have it in our power to select and employ, suited to those different occasions. Herein we are in­finitely superior to the French, whose poeti­cal Language, if it were not distinguished by rhyme, would not be known to differ from their ordinary prose."
"IT is chiefly, indeed, on grave subjects, and with respect to the stronger emotions of the mind, that our Language displays its power of expression. We are said to have thirty words, at least, for denoting all the va­rieties of the passion of anger*. But, in scribing the more delicate sentiments and emotions, our Tongue is not so fertile. It must be confessed, that the French Lan­guage surpasses ours, by far, in expressing the nicer shades of character; especially those varieties of manner, temper, and behaviour, which are displayed in our social intercourse with one another. Let any one attempt to translate, into English, only a few pages of one of Marivaux Novels, and he will soon be sensible of our deficiency of expression on these subjects. Indeed, no Language is so copious as the French for whatever is licate,  gay, and amusing. It is, perhaps, the happiest Language for conversation in the known world; but, on the higher subjects of composition, the English may be justly esteemed to excel it considerably."
"LANGUAGE is generally understood to re­ceive its predominant tincture from the na­tional character of the people who speak it. We must not, indeed, expect, that it will carry an exact and full impression of their genius and manners; for, among all nations, the original stock of words which they re­ceived from their ancestors, remain as the foundation of their Speech throughout many ages, while their manners undergo, perhaps, very great alterations. National character will, however, always have some perceptible influence on the turn of Language; and the gaiety and vivacity of the French, and the gravity and thoughtfulness of the English, are sufficiently impressed on their respective Tongues."
"FROM the genius of our Language, and the character of those who speak it, it may be expected to have strength and energy. It is, indeed, naturally prolix; owing to the great number of particles and auxiliary verbs which we are obliged constantly to employ; and this prolixity must, in some degree, en­feeble it. We seldom can express so much by one word as was done by the verbs, and by the nouns, in the Greek and Roman Lan­guages.  Our style is less compact; our con­ceptions being spread out among more words, and split, as it were, into more parts, make a fainter impression when we utter them. Notwithstanding this defect, by our abound in terms for expressing all the strong emo­tions of the mind, and by the liberty which we enjoy, in a greater degree than most na­tions, of compounding words, our Language may be esteemed to possess considerable force of expression; comparatively, at least, with the other modern Tongues, though much below the ancient  The Style of Milton alone, both in poetry and prose, is a suffici­ent proof, that the English Tongue is far from being destitute of nerves and energy."
"THE flexibility of a Language, or its pow­er of accommodation to different styles and manners, so as to be either grave and strong, or easy and flowing, or tender and gentle, or pompous and magnificent, as occasions re­quire, or as an author genius prompts, is a quality of great importance in speaking and writing. It seems to depend upon three things; the copiousness of a Language; the different arrangements of which its words are susceptible; and the variety and beauty of the sound of those words, so as to correspond to many different subjects. Never did any Tongue possess this quality so eminently as the Greek, which every writer of genius could so mould, as to make the style perfectly ex­pressive of his own manner and peculiar  turn. It had all the three requisites, which I have mentioned, as necessary for this pur­pose. It joined to these the graceful variety of its different dialects; and thereby readily assumed every sort of character which an au­thor could wish, from the most simple and most familiar, up to the most majestic. The Latin, though a very beautiful Language, is inferior, in this respect, to the Greek. It has more of a fixed character of stateliness and gravity. It is always firm and masculine in the tenor of its sound; and is supported by a certain senatorial dignity, of which it is difficult for a writer to divest it wholly, on any occasion. Among the modern Tongues, the Italian possesses a great deal more of this flexibility than the French. By its copious­ness, its freedom of arrangement, and the great beauty and harmony of its sounds, it suits itself very happily to most subjects, either in prose or in poetry; is capable of the au­gust and the strong, as well as the tender; and seems to be, on the whole, the most per­fect of all the modern dialects which have arisen out of the ruins of the ancient  Our own Language, though not equal to the Ita­lian in flexibility, yet is not destitute of a considerable degree of this quality. If any one will consider the diversity of style which appears in some of our classics; that great difference of manner, for instance, which is marked by the Style of Lord Shaftsbury, and that of Dean Swift; he will see, in our Tongue, such a circle of expression, such a  power of accommodation to the different taste of writers, as redounds not a little to its honour."
"WHAT the English has been most taxed with, is its deficiency in harmony of sound. But though every native is apt to be partial to the sounds of his own Language, and may, therefore, be suspected of not being a fair judge in this point; yet, I imagine, there are evident grounds on which it may be shown, that this charge against our Tongue has been carried too far. The melody of our versification, its power of supporting poeti­cal numbers, without any assistance from rhyme, is alone a sufficient proof that our Lan­guage is far from being unmusical. Our verse is, after the Italian, the most diversified and harmonious of any of the modern dialects; unquestionably far beyond the French verse, in variety, sweetness, and melody. Mr. She­ridan has shown, in his Lectures, that we abound more in vowel and diphthong sounds, than most Languages; and these too, so di­vided into long and short, as to afford a pro­per diversity in the quantity of our syllables. Our consonants, he observes, which appear so crowded to the eye on paper, often form combinations not disagreeable to the ear in pronouncing; and, in particular, the objec which has been made to the frequent recurrence of the hissing consonant in our Language, is unjust and ill-founded. For, it has not been attended to, that very common­ly,  and in the final syllables especially, this letter loses altogether the hissing sound, and is transformed into a  which is one of the sounds on which the ear rests with pleasure; as in has, these, those, loves, hears, and innu­merable more, where, though the letter be retained in writing, it has really the power of  not of the common "
"AFTER all, however, it must be admitted, that smoothness, or beauty of sound, is none of the distinguishing properties of the English Tongue. Though not incapable of being formed into melodious arrangements, yet strength and expressiveness, more than grace, form its character. We incline, in general, to a short pronunciation of our words, and have shortened the quantity of most of those which we borrow from the Latin, as orator, spectacle, theatre, liberty, and such like. A­greeable to this, is a remarkable peculiarity of English pronunciation, the throwing the accent farther back, that is, nearer the be­ginning of the word, than is done by any other nation. In Greek and Latin, no word is accented farther back than the third sylla­ble from the end, or what is called the ante­penult. But, in English, we have many words accented on the fourth, some on the fifth syllable from the end, as, mÃªmorable, con­vÃªniency, Ã¢mbulatory, prÃ´fitableness. The ge­neral effect of this practice of hastening the accent, or placing it so near the beginning of a word, is to give a brisk and a spirited, but  at the same time, a rapid and hurried, and not very musical, tone to the whole pronun­ciation of a people."
"THE English Tongue possesses, undoubt­edly, this property, of being the most sim­ple in its form and construction, of all the European dialects. It is free from all intricacy of cases, declensions, moods and tenses. Its words are subject to fewer variations from their original form than those of any other Language. Its substantives have no distinc of gender, except what nature has made, and but one variation in case. Its adjectives admit of no change at all, except what ex­presses the degree of comparison. Its verbs, instead of running through all the varieties of ancient conjugation, suffer no more than four or five changes in termination. By the help of a few prepositions and auxiliary verbs, all the purposes of significancy in meaning are accomplished; while the words, for the most part, preserve their form unchanged. The disadvantages in point of elegance, bre­vity, and force, which follow from this struc­ture of our Language, I have before pointed out. But, at the same time, it must be mitted, that such a structure contributes to facility. It renders the acquisition of our Language less laborious, the arrangement of our words more plain and obvious, the rules of our syntax fewer and more simple."
" I AGREE, indeed, with Dr. Lowth (pre­face to his Grammar), in thinking that this very simplicity and facility of our Language proves a cause of its being frequently writ­ten and spoken with less accuracy. It was necessary to study Languages, which were of a more complex and artificial form, with greater care. The marks of gender and case, the varieties of conjugation and declension, the multiplied rules of syntax, were all to be attended to in Speech. Hence Language be­came more an object of art. It was reduced into form; a standard was established; and any departures from the standard became conspicuous. Whereas, among us, Language is hardly considered as an object of gramma­tical rule. We take it for granted, that a competent skill in it may be acquired without any study; and that, in a syntax so narrow and confined as ours, there is nothing which demands attention. Hence arises the habit of writing in a loose and inaccurate manner."
"I ADMIT, that no grammatical rules have sufficient authority to controul the firm and established usage of Language. Established custom in speaking and writing, is the stand­ard to which we must at last resort for deter­mining every controverted point in Language and Style. But it will not follow from this, that grammatical rules are superseded as useless. In every Language, which has been in any degree cultivated, there prevails a cer­tain  structure and analogy of parts, which is understood to give foundation to the most re­putable usage of Speech; and which, in all cases, when usage is loose or dubious, pos­sesses considerable authority. In every Lan­guage, there are rules of syntax which must be inviolably observed by all who would ei­ther write or speak with any propriety. For syntax is no other than that arrangement of words, in a sentence, which renders the meaning of each word, and the relation of all the words to one another, most clear and intelligible."
"ALL the rules of Latin syntax, it is true, cannot be applied to our Language. Many of those rules arose from the particular form of their Language, which occasioned verbs or prepositions to govern, some the genitive, some the dative, some the accusative or abla­tive case. But, abstracting from these pecu­liarities, it is to be always remembered, that the chief and fundamental rules of syntax are common to the English as well as the tin Tongue; and, indeed, belong equally to all Languages. For, in all Languages, the parts which compose Speech are essentially the same; substantives, adjectives, verbs, and connecting particles: And wherever these parts of Speech are found, there are certain necessary relations among them, which regu­late their syntax, or the place which they ought to possess in a sentence. Thus, in En­glish,  just as much as in Latin, the adjective must, by position, be made to agree with its substantive; and the verb must agree with its nominative in person and number; because, from the nature of things, a word, which expresses either a quality or an action, must correspond as closely as possible with the name of that thing whose quality, or whose action, it expresses. Two or more substan­tives, joined by a copulative, must always require the verbs or pronouns, to which they refer, to be placed in the plural number; otherwise, their common relation to these verbs or pronouns is not pointed out. An active verb must, in every Language, govern the accusative; that is, clearly point out some substantive noun, as the object to which its action is directed. A relative pronoun must, in every form of Speech, agree with its an­tecedent in gender, number, and person; and conjunctions, or connecting particles, ought always to couple like cases and moods; that is, ought to join together words which are of the same form and state with each other. I mention these, as a few exempli­fications of that fundamental regard to syn­tax, which, even in such a Language as ours, is absolutely requisite for writing or speaking with any propriety."
"WHATEVER the advantages, or defects of the English Language be, as it is our own Language, it deserves a high degree of our  study and attention, both with regard to the choice of words which we employ, and with regard to the syntax, or the arrangement of these words in a sentence. We know how much the Greeks and the Romans, in their most polished and flourishing times, cultivat their own Tongues. We know how much study both the French, and the Itali­ans, have bestowed upon theirs. Whatever knowledge may be acquired by the study of other Languages, it can never be communi­cated with advantage, unless by such as can write and speak their own Language well. Let the matter of an author be ever so good and useful, his compositions will always suf­fer in the public esteem, if his expression be deficient in purity and propriety. At the same time, the attainment of a correct and elegant style, is an object which demands application and labour. If any imagine they can catch it merely by the ear, or acquire it by a slight perusal of some of our good authors, they will find themselves much disappointed. The many errors, even in point of grammer, the many offences against purity of Language, which are committed by writers who are far from being contemptible, demonstrate, that a careful study of the Language is previously requisite, in all who aim at writing it pro­perly*."
"LECTURE  STYLE ”PERSPICUITY AND PRECISION."
"HAVING finished the subject of Lan­guage, I now enter on the consideration of Style, and the rules that relate to it."
"IT is not easy to give a precise idea of what is meant by Style. The best definition I can give of it, is, the peculiar manner in which a man expresses his conceptions, by means of Language. It is different from mere Language or words. The words, which an author employs, may be proper and fault­less; and his Style may, nevertheless, have great faults; it may be dry, or stiff, or fee­ble, or affected. Style has always some re­ference to an author manner of thinking. It is a picture of the ideas which rise in his mind, and of the manner in which they rise there; and, hence, when we are examining an author composition, it is, in many cases,  extremely difficult to separate the Style from the sentiment. No wonder these two should be so intimately connected, as Style is no­thing else, than that sort of expression which our thoughts most readily assume. Hence, different countries have been noted for pecu­liarities of Style, suited to their different temper and genius. The eastern nations animated their Style with the most strong and hyperbolical figures. The Athenians, a po­lished and acute people, formed a Style ac­curate, clear, and neat. The Asiatics, gay and loose in their manners, affected a Style florid and diffuse. The like sort of charac­teristical differences are commonly remarked in the Style of the French, the English, and the Spaniards. In giving the general charac­ters of Style, it is usual to talk of a nervous, a feeble, or a spirited Style; which are plain­ly the characters of a writer manner of thinking, as well as of expressing himself: So difficult it is to separate these two things from one another. Of the general characters of Style, I am afterwards to discourse; but it will be necessary to begin with examining the more simple qualities of it; from the as­semblage of which, its more complex deno­minations, in a great measure, result."
"ALL the qualities of a good Style may be ranged under two heads, Perspicuity and Or­nament. For all that can possibly be requir of Language, is, to convey our ideas clearly to the minds of others, and, at the  same time, in such a dress, as by pleasing and interesting them, shall most effectually strengthen the impressions which we seek to make. When both these ends are answered, we certainly accomplish every purpose for which we use Writing and Discourse."
"PERSPICUITY, it will be readily admitted, is the fundamental quality of Style*; a qua­lity so essential in every kind of writing, that, for the want of it, nothing can atone. With­out this, the richest ornaments of Style only glimmer through the dark; and puzzle, in­stead of pleasing, the reader. This, there­fore, must be our first object, to make our meaning clearly and fully understood, and understood without the least difficulty. ratio, says Quinctilian, debet negligenter quoque audientibus esse aperta; ut in ani­mum audientis, sicut sol in oculos, etiamsi in eum non intendatur, occurrat. Quare, non solum ut intelligere possit, sed ne om­nino possit non intelligere curandum  . If we are obliged to follow a writer with much care, to pause, and to read over his sentences a second time, in order to compre­hend  them fully, he will never please us long. Mankind are too indolent to relish so much labour. They may pretend to admire the author depth, after they have discovered his meaning; but they will seldom be inclin to take up his work a second time."
"AUTHORS sometimes plead the difficulty of their subject, as an excuse for the want of Perspicuity. But the excuse can rarely, if ever, be sustained. For whatever a man conceives clearly, that, it is in his power, if he will be at the trouble, to put into distinct propositions, or to express clearly to others: and upon no subject ought any man to write, where he cannot think clearly. His ideas, indeed, may, very excusably, be on some subjects incomplete or inadequate; but still, as far as they go, they ought to be clear; and, wherever this is the case, Perspicuity, in expressing them, is always attainable. The obscurity which reigns so much among many metaphysical writers, is, for the most part, owing to the indistinctness of their own con­ceptions. They see the object but in a con­fused light; and, of course, can never exhi­bit it in a clear one to others."
"PERSPICUITY in writing, is not to be con­sidered as only a sort of negative virtue, or freedom from defect. It has higher merit: It is a degree of positive beauty. We are pleased with an author, we consider him as deserving praise, who frees us from all fatigue  of searching for his meaning; who carries us through his subject without any embarrass­ment or confusion; whose style flows always like a limpid stream, where we see to the very bottom."
"THE study of Perspicuity requires atten  first, to single words and phrases, and then to the construction of sentences. I be­gin with treating of the first, and shall con­fine myself to it in this Lecture."
"PERSPICUITY, considered with respect to words and phrases, requires these three qua­lities in them; Purity, Propriety, and Preci­sion."
"PURITY and Propriety of Language, are often used indiscriminately for each other; and, indeed, they are very nearly allied. A distinction, however, obtains between them. Purity, is the use of such words, and such constructions, as belong to the idiom of the Language which we speak; in opposition to words and phrases that are imported from other Languages, or that are obsolete, or new coined, or used without proper autho­rity. Propriety, is the selection of such words in the Language, as the best and most established usage has appropriated to those ideas which we intend to express by them. It implies the correct and happy application of them, according to that usage, in opposition  to vulgarisms, or low expressions; and to words and phrases, which would be less sig­nificant of the ideas that we mean to convey. Style may be pure, that is, it may all be strict­ly English, without Scotticisms or Galli­cisms, or ungrammatical irregular expressions of any kind, and may, nevertheless, be defi­cient in Propriety. The words may be ill chosen; not adapted to the subject, nor fully expressive of the author sense. He has taken all his words and phrases from the ge­neral mass of English Language; but he has made his selection among these words unhap­pily. Whereas, Style cannot be proper with­out being also pure; and where both Purity and Propriety meet, besides making Style perspicuous, they also render it graceful. There is no standard, either of Purity or of Propriety, but the practice of the best writers and speakers in the country."
"WHEN I mentioned obsolete or new-coin words as incongruous with Purity of Style, it will be easily understood, that some excep­tions are to be made. On certain occasions, they may have grace. Poetry admits of greater latitude than prose, with respect to coining, or, at least, new-compounding words; yet, even here, this liberty should be used with a sparing hand. In prose, such innovations are more hazardous, and have a worse effect. They are apt to give Style an affected and conceited air; and should never  be ventured upon, except by such, whose established reputation gives them some degree of dictatorial power over Language."
"THE introduction of foreign and learned words, unless where necessity requires them, should always be avoided. Barren Lan­guages may need such assistances; but ours is not one of these. Dean Swift, one of our most correct writers, valued himself much on using no words but such as were of native growth: and his Language may, indeed, be considered as a standard of the strictest Pu­rity and Propriety in the choice of words. At present, we seem to be departing from this standard. A multitude of Latin words have, of late, been poured in upon us. On some occasions, they give an appearance of elevation and dignity to Style. But often also, they render it stiff and forced: And, in general, a plain native Style, as it is more intelligible to all readers, so, by a proper ma­nagement of words, it can be made equally strong and expressive with this Latinised English."
"LET us now consider the import of Pre­cision in Language, which, as it is the high­est part of the quality denoted by Perspi­cuity, merits a full explication; and the more, because distinct ideas are, perhaps, not com­monly formed about it."
" THE exact import of Precision may be drawn from the etymology of the word. It comes from precidere, to cut off: It im­ports retrenching all superfluities, and prun the expression so, as to exhibit neither more nor less than an exact copy of his idea who uses it. I observed before, that it is often difficult to separate the qualities of Style from the qualities of Thought; and it is found so in this instance. For, in order to write with Precision, though this be properly a quality of Style, one must possess a very considerable degree of distinctness and accu­racy in his manner of thinking."
"THE words, which a man uses to express his ideas, may be faulty in three respects: They may either not express that idea which the author intends, but some other which only resembles, or is akin to it; or, they may express that idea, but not quite fully and completely; or, they may express it, to­gether with something more than he intends. Precision stands opposed to all these three faults; but chiefly to the last. In an author writing with Propriety, his being free of the two former faults seems implied. The words which he uses are proper; that is, they ex­press that idea which he intends, and they express it fully; but to be Precise, signifies, that they express that idea, and no more. There is nothing in his words which intro­duces any foreign idea, any superfluous un­seasonable accessory, so as to mix it con­fusedly  with the principal object, and there­by to render our conception of that object loose and indistinct. This requires a writer to have, himself, a very clear apprehension of the object he means to present to us; to have laid fast hold of it in his mind; and never to waver in any one view he takes of it: a perfection to which, indeed, few wri­ters attain."
"THE use and importance of Precision, may be deduced from the nature of the human mind. It never can view, clearly and di­stinctly, above one object at a time. If it must look at two or three together, especially objects among which there is resemblance or connection, it finds itself confused and em­barrassed. It cannot clearly perceive in what they agree, and in what they differ. Thus, were any object, suppose some animal, to be presented to me, of whose structure I wanted to form a distinct notion, I would desire all its trappings to be taken off, I would require it to be brought before me by itself, and to stand alone, that there might be nothing to distract my attention. The same is the case with words. If, when you would inform me of your meaning, you also tell me more than what conveys it; if you join foreign circum­stances to the principal object; if, by unne­cessarily varying the expression, you shift the point of view, and make me see sometimes the object itself, and sometimes another thing that is connected with it; you thereby oblige  me to look on several objects at once, and I lose sight of the principal. You load the animal, you are showing me, with so many trappings and collars, and bring so many of the same species before me, somewhat re­sembling, and yet somewhat differing, that I see none of them clearly."
"This forms what is called a Loose Style; and is the proper opposite to Precision. It generally arises from using a superfluity of words. Feeble writers employ a multitude of words to make themselves understood, as they think, more distinctly; and they only confound the reader. They are sensible of not having caught the precise expression, to convey what they would signify; they do not, indeed, conceive their own meaning very precisely themselves; and, therefore, help it out, as they can, by this and the other word, which may, as they suppose, supply the defect, and bring you somewhat nearer to their idea: They are always going about it, and about it, but never just hit the thing. The image as they set it before you, is al­ways seen double; and no double image is distinct. When an author tells me of his he­ro courage in the day of battle, the expres­sion is precise, and I understand it fully. But if, from the desire of multiplying words, he will needs praise his courage and fortitude; at the moment he joins these words together, my idea begins to waver. He means to ex­press one quality more strongly; but he is, in  truth, expressing two. Courage resists dan­ger; fortitude supports pain. The occasion of exerting each of these qualities is differ­ent; and being led to think of both together, when only one of them should be in my view, my view is rendered unsteady, and my conception of the object indistinct."
"FROM what I have said, it appears that an author may, in a qualified sense, be perspi­cuous, while yet he is far from being precise. He uses proper words, and proper arrange­ment; he gives you the idea as clear as he conceives it himself; and so far he is perspi­cuous: but the ideas are not very clear in his own mind; they are loose and general; and, therefore, cannot be expressed with Precision. All subjects do not equally require Precision. It is sufficient, on many occasions, that we have a general view of the meaning. The subject, perhaps, is of the known and fami­liar kind; and we are in no hazard of mis­taking the sense of the author, though every word which he uses be not precise and exact."
"FEW authors, for instance, in the English Language, are more clear and perspicuous, on the whole, than Archbishop Tillotson, and Sir William Temple; yet neither of them are remarkable for Precision. They are loose and diffuse; and accustomed to ex­press their meaning by several words, which shew you fully whereabouts it lies, rather than to single out those expressions, which  would convey clearly the idea they have in view, and no more. Neither, indeed, is Precision the prevailing character of Mr. dison Style; although he is not so deficient in this respect as the other two authors."
"LORD SHAFTSBURY faults, in point of Precision, are much greater than Mr. Addi­son  and the more unpardonable, because he is a professed philosophical writer; who, as such, ought, above all things, to have stu­died Precision. His Style has both great beauties, and great faults; and, on the whole, is by no means a safe model for imitation. Lord Shaftsbury was well acquainted with the power of words; those which he employs are generally proper and well sounding; he has great variety of them; and his arrange­ment, as shall be afterwards shown, is com­monly beautiful. His defect, in Precision, is not owing so much to indistinct or confused ideas, as to perpetual affectation. He is fond, to excess, of the pomp and parade of Language; he is never satisfied with expres­sing any thing clearly and simply; he must always give it the dress of state and majesty. Hence perpetual circumlocutions, and many words and phrases employed to describe some­what, that would have been described much better by one of them. If he has occasion to mention any person or author, he very rarely mentions him by his proper name. In the treatise, entitled, Advice to an Author, he descants for two or three pages together  upon Aristotle, without once naming him in any other way, than the Master Critic, the Mighty Genius and Judge of Art, the Prince of Critics, the Grand Master of Art, and Consummate Philologist. In the same way, the Grand Poetic Sire, the Philosophical Pa­triarch, and his Disciple of Noble Birth, and lofty Genius, are the only names by which he condescends to distinguish Homer, So­crates, and Plato, in another passage of the same treatise. This method of distinguish persons is extremely affected; but it is not so contrary to Precision, as the frequent circumlocutions he employs for all moral ideas; attentive, on every occasion, more to the pomp of Language, than to the clear­ness which he ought to have studied as a philosopher. The moral sense, for instance, after he had once defined it, was a clear term; but, how vague becomes the idea, when, in the next page, he calls it, That natural affection, and anticipating fancy, which makes the sense of right and wrong? Self examination, or reflection on our own conduct, is an idea conceived with ease; but when it is wrought into all the forms of, A man dividing himself into two parties, becoming a self-dialogist, entering into part­nership with himself, forming the dual number practically within himself; we hardly know what to make of it. On some occasions, he so adorns, or rather loads with words, the plainest and simplest propositions,  as, if not to obscure, at least, to enfeeble them."
"IN the following paragraph, for example, of the Inquiry concerning Virtue, he means to show, that, by every ill action we hurt our mind, as much as one who should swallow poison, or give himself a wound, would hurt his body. Observe what a redundancy of words he pours forth: Now, if the fabrick of the mind or temper appeared to us, such as it really is; if we saw it impossible to remove hence any one good or orderly af­fection, or to introduce any ill or disorderly one, without drawing on, in some degree, that dissolute state which, at its height, is confessed to be so miserable; it would then, undoubtedly, be confessed, that since no ill, immoral, or unjust action, can be com­mitted, without either a new inroad and breach on the temper and passions, or a further advancing of that execution already done; whoever did ill, or acted in preju­dice of his integrity, good-nature, or worth, would of necessity, act with greater cru­elty towards himself, than he who scrupled not to swallow what was poisonous, or who, with his own hands, should voluntarily mangle or wound his outward form or con­stitution, natural limbs or body*. Here, to commit a bad action, is, first, To re­move a good and orderly affection, and to  introduce an ill or disorderly one; next, it is, To commit an action that is ill, immo­ral, and unjust; and in the next line, it is, To do ill, or to act in prejudice of in­tegrity, good-nature, and worth; nay, so very simple a thing as a man wounding him­self, is, To mangle, or wound, his out­ward form and constitution, his natural limbs or body. Such superfluity of words is disgustful to every reader of correct taste; and serves no purpose but to embarrass and perplex the sense. This sort of Style is ele­gantly described by Quinctilian, Est in qui­busdam turba inanium verborum, qui dum communem loquendi morem reformidant, ducti specie nitoris, circumeunt omnia co­piosa loquacitate quae dicere volunt*.   cap. 2."
"THE great source of a loose Style, in op­position to Precision, is the injudicious use of those words termed Synonymous. They are called Synonymous, because they agree in expressing one principal idea; but, for the most part, if not always, they express it with some diversity in the circumstances. They are varied by some accessory idea which eve­ry word introduces, and which forms the distinction between them. Hardly, in any  Language, are there two words that convey precisely the same idea; a person thoroughly conversant in the propriety of the Language, will always be able to observe something that distinguishes them. As they are like different shades of the same colour, an ac­curate writer can employ them to great vantage, by using them, so as to heighten and to finish the picture which he gives us. He supplies by one, what was wanting in the other, to the force, or to the lustre of the image which he means to exhibit. But, in order to this end, he must be extremely at­tentive to the choice which he makes of them. For the bulk of writers are very apt to confound them with each other; and to employ them carelessly, merely for the sake of filling up a period, or of rounding and di­versifying the Language, as if their significa were exactly the same, while, in truth, it is not. Hence a certain mist, and indis­tinctness, is unwarily thrown over Style."
"IN the Latin Language, there are no two words we would more readily take to be sy­nonymous, than amare and diligere. Cicero, however, has shewn us, that there is a very clear distinction between them, Quid ergo, says he, in one of his epistles, tibi com­mendem eum quem tu ipse diligis? Sed tamen ut scires eum non a me diligi solum, verum etiam amari, ob eam rem tibi haec scribo*. In the same manner tutus and  securus, are words which we would readily confound; yet their meaning is different. Tutus, signifies out of danger; securus, free from the dread of it. Seneca has elegantly marked this distinction; Tuta scelera esse possunt, secura non possunt  . In our own Language, very many instances might be given of a difference in meaning among words reputed Synonymous; and, as the sub­ject is of importance, I shall now point out some of these. The instances which I am to give, may themselves be of use; and they will serve to shew the necessity of attending, with care and strictness, to the exact import of words, if ever we would write with Pro­priety or Precision."
"Austerity, Severity, Rigour. Austerity, re­lates to the manner of living; Severity, of thinking; Rigour, of punishing. To Au­sterity, is opposed Effeminacy; to Severity, Relaxation; to Rigour, Clemency. A Her­mit, is austere in his life; a Casuist, severe in his application of religion or law; a Judge, rigorous in his sentences."
"Custom, Habit. Custom, respects the ac  Habit, the actor. By Custom, we mean the frequent repetition of the same act; by Habit, the effect which that repe­tition produces on the mind or body. By the Custom of walking often on the streets, one acquires a Habit of idleness."
" Surprised, astonished, amazed, confounded. I am surprised with what is new or unex­pected; I am astonished, at what is vast or great; I am amazed, with what is incompre­hensible; I am confounded, by what is shock or terrible."
"Desist, renounce, quit, leave off. Each of these words imply some pursuit or object re­linquished; but from different motives. We desist, from the difficulty of accomplishing. We renounce, on account of the disagreea­bleness of the object, or pursuit. We quit, for the sake of some other thing which in­terests us more; and we leave off, because we are weary of the design. A Politician desists from his designs, when he finds they are impracticable; he renounces the court, because he has been affronted by it; he quits ambition for study or retirement; and leaves off his attendance on the great, as he be­comes old and weary of it."
"Pride, Vanity. Pride, makes us esteem ourselves; Vanity, makes us desire the esteem of others. It is just to say, as Dean Swift has done, that a man is too proud to be vain."
"Haughtiness, Disdain. Haughtiness, is founded on the high opinion we entertain of ourselves; Disdain, on the low opinion we have of others."
" To distinguish, to separate. We distinguish, what we want not to confound with another thing; we separate, what we want to re­move from it. Objects are distinguished from one another, by their qualities. They are separated, by the distance of time or place."
"To weary, to fatigue. The continuance of the same thing wearies us; labour fatigues us. I am weary with standing; I am fatigued with walking. A suitor wearies us by his per­severance; fatigues us by his importunity."
"To abhor, to detest. To abhor, imports, simply, strong dislike; to detest, imports also strong disapprobation. One abhors being in debt; he detests treachery."
"To invent, to discover. We invent things that are new; we discover what was before hidden. Galileo invented the telescope; Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood."
"Only, alone. Only, imports that there is no other of the same kind; alone, imports being accompanied by no other. An only child, is one who has neither brother nor sister; a child alone, is one who is left by it­self. There is a difference, therefore, in pre­cise Language, between these two phrases, Virtue only makes us happy; and, Vir­tue alone makes us happy. Virtue only makes us happy, imports, that nothing else  can do it. Virtue alone makes us happy, imports, that virtue, by itself, or unaccom­panied with other advantages, is sufficient to do it."
"Entire, Complete. A thing is entire, by wanting none of its parts; complete, by wanting none of the appendages that belong to it. A man may have an entire house to himself; and yet not have one complete apartment."
"Tranquillity, Peace, Calm. Tranquillity, respects a situation free from trouble, consi­dered in itself; Peace, the same situation with respect to any causes that might inter­rupt it; Calm, with regard to a disturbed situation going before, or following it. A good man enjoys Tranquillity, in himself; Peace, with others; and Calm, after the storm."
"A Difficulty, an Obstacle. A Difficulty, embarrasses; an Obstacle, stops us. We re­move the one; we surmount the other. Generally, the first, expresses somewhat aris from the nature and circumstances of the affair; the second, somewhat arising from a foreign cause. Philip found Difficulty in ma­naging the Athenians from the nature of their dispositions; but the eloquence of mosthenes was the greatest obstacle to his designs."
" Wisdom, Prudence, Wisdom, leads us to speak and act what is most proper. Pru­dence, prevents our speaking or acting im­properly. A wise man, employs the most proper means for success; a prudent man, the safest means for not being brought into danger."
"Enough, Sufficient. Enough, relates to the quantity which one wishes to have of any thing. Sufficient, relates to the use that is to be made of it. Hence, Enough, general­ly imports a greater quantity than Sufficient does. The covetous man never has enough; although he has what is sufficient for nature."
"To avow, to acknowledge, to confess. Each of these words imports the affirmation of a fact, but in very different circumstances. To avow, supposes the person to glory in it; to acknowledge, supposes a small degree of faultiness, which the acknowledgment com­pensates; to confess, supposes a higher gree of crime. A patriot avows his opposi to a bad minister, and is applauded; a gentleman acknowledges his mistake, and is forgiven; a prisoner confesses the crime he is accused of, and is punished."
"To remark, to observe. We remark, in the way of attention, in order to remember; we observe, in the way of examination, in or­der to judge. A traveller remarks the most  striking object he sees; a general observes all the motions of his enemy."
"Equivocal, Ambiguous. An Equivocal Ex­pression is, one which has one sense open, and designed to be understood; another sense concealed, and understood only by the per­son who uses it. An Ambiguous Expression is, one which has apparently two senses, and leaves us at a loss which of them to give it. An equivocal expression is used with an in­tention to deceive; an ambiguous one, when it is used with design, is, with an intention not to give full information. An honest man will never employ an equivocal expres­sion; a confused man may often utter ambi­guous ones, without any design. I shall give only one instance more."
"With, By. Both these particles express the connection between some instrument, or means of effecting an end, and the agent who employs it: but with, expresses a more close and immediate connection; by, a more remote one. We kill a man with a sword; he dies by violence. The criminal is bound with ropes by the executioner. The proper distinction in the use of these particles, is elegantly marked in a passage of Dr. Robert­son History of Scotland. When one of the old Scottish kings was making an enquiry in­to the tenure by which his nobles held their lands, they started up, and drew their swords: By these, said they, we acquired our  lands, and with these, we will defend them. By these we acquired our lands; signifies the more remote means of acquisition by force and martial deeds; and, with these we will defend them; signifies the imme­diate direct instrument, the sword, which they would employ in their defence."
"THESE are instances of words, in our Language, which, by careless writers, are apt to be employed as perfectly synonymous, and yet are not so. Their significations ap­proach, but are not precisely the same. The more the distinction in the meaning of such words is weighed, and attended to, the more clearly and forcibly shall we speak or write*."
"FROM all that has been said on this head, it will now appear, that, in order to write or speak with Precision, two things are especi­ally requisite; one, that an author own ideas be clear and distinct; and the other, that he have an exact and full comprehen­sion  of the force of those words which he employs. Natural genius is here required; labour and attention still more. Dean Swift is one of the authors, in our Language, most distinguished for Precision of Style. In his writings, we seldom or never find vague ex­pressions, and synonymous words, carelesly thrown together. His meaning is always clear, and strongly marked."
"I HAD occasion to observe before, that though all subjects of writing or discourse demand Perspicuity, yet all do not require the same degree of that exact Precision, which I have endeavoured to explain. It is, indeed, in every sort of writing, a great beauty to have, at least, some measure of Precision, in distinction from that loose profusion of words which imprints no clear idea on the reader mind. But we must, at the same time, be on our guard, lest too great a study of Pre­cision, especially in subjects where it is not strictly requisite, betray us into a dry and barren Style; lest, from the desire of prun too closely, we retrench all copiousness and ornament. Some degree of this failing may, perhaps, be remarked in Dean Swift serious works. Attentive only to exhibit his ideas clear and exact, resting wholly on his sense and distinctness, he appears to reject, disdainfully, all embellishment which, on some occasions, may be thought to render his manner somewhat hard and dry. To unite together Copiousness and Precision, to  be flowing and graceful, and, at the same time, correct and exact in the choice of every word, is, no doubt, one of the highest and most difficult attainments in writing. Some kinds of composition may require more of Copiousness and Ornament; others, more of Precision and Accuracy; nay, in the same composition, the different parts of it may mand a proper variation of manner. But we must study never to sacrifice, totally, any one of these qualities to the other; and, by a proper management, both of them may be made fully consistent, if our own ideas be precise, and our knowledge and stock of words be, at the same time, extensive."
"LECTURE XI. STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES."
"HAVING begun to treat of Style, in the last Lecture I considered its fundamen­tal quality, Perspicuity. What I have said of this, relates chiefly to the choice of Words. From words I proceed to Sentences; and as, in all writing and discourse, the proper com­position and structure of Sentences is of the highest importance, I shall treat of this fully. Though Perspicuity be the general head un­der which I, at present, consider Language, I shall not confine myself to this quality alone, in Sentences, but shall enquire also, what is requisite for their Grace and Beau­ty: that I may bring together, under one view, all that seems necessary to be attended to in the construction and arrangement of words in a Sentence."
"IT is not easy to give an exact definition of a Sentence, or Period, farther, than as it  always implies some one complete proposition or enunciation of thought. Aristotle defi­nition is, in the main, a good one:  [...]: A form of Speech which hath a beginning and an end within itself, and is of such a length as to be easily comprehended at once. This, however, admits of great latitude. For a Sentence, or Period, consists always of component parts, which are called its mem­bers; and as these members may be either few or many, and may be connected in seve­ral different ways, the same thought, or men­tal proposition, may often be either brought into one Sentence, or split into two or three, without the material breach of any rule."
"THE first variety that occurs in the consi­deration of Sentences, is, the distinction of long and short ones. The precise length of Sentences, as to the number of words, or the number of members, which may enter into them, cannot be ascertained by any definite measure. Only, it is obvious, there may be an extreme on either side. Sentences, im­moderately long, and consisting of too many members, always transgress some one or other of the rules which I shall mention soon, as necessary to be observed in every good Sen­tence. In discourses that are to be spoken, regard must be had to the easiness of pronun­ciation, which is not consistent with too long periods. In compositions where pronuncia has no place, still, however, by using  long periods too frequently, an author over­loads the reader ear, and fatigues his at­tention. For long Periods require, evident­ly, more attention than short ones, in order to perceive clearly the connection of the se­veral parts, and to take in the whole at one view. At the same time, there may be an excess in too many short Sentences also; by which the sense is split and broken, the con­nexion of thought weakened, and the me­mory burdened, by presenting to it a long succession of minute objects."
"WITH regard to the length and constructi­on of Sentences, the French critics make a very just distinction of Style, into Style Pe­riodique, and Style CoupÃ©. The Style Periodi­que is, where the sentences are composed of several members linked together, and hang upon one another, so that the sense of the whole is not brought out till the close. This is the most pompous, musical, and ora­torical manner of composing; as in the fol­lowing sentence of Sir William Temple: If you look about you, and consider the lives of others as well as your own; if you think how few are born with honour, and how many die without name or children; how little beauty we see, and how few friends we hear of; how many diseases, and how much poverty there is in the world; you will fall down upon your knees, and, instead of repining at one affliction, will admire so many blessings which you have  received from the hand of God. (Letter to Lady Essex.) Cicero abounds with Sen­tences constructed after this manner."
"THE Style CoupÃ© is, where the sense is form into short independent propositions, each complete within itself; as in the following of Mr. Pope: I confess, it was want of con­sideration that made me an author. I writ, because it amused me. I corrected, because it was as pleasant to me to correct as to write. I published, because, I was told, I might please such as it was a credit to please. (Preface to his works.) This is very much the French method of writing; and always suits gay and easy subjects. The Style Periodique, gives an air of gravity and dignity to composition. The Style CoupÃ©, is more lively and striking. According to the nature of the composition, therefore, and the general character it ought to bear, the one or other may be predominant. But, in almost every kind of composition, the great rule is to intermix them. For the ear tires of either of them when too long continued: Whereas, by a proper mixture of long and short Periods, the ear is gratified, and a cer­tain sprightliness is joined with majesty in our style. Non semper, says Cicero  scribing very expressively, these two differ­ent kinds of Styles, of which I have been speaking,) non semper utendum est perpe­tuitate, & quasi conversione verborum;  sed saepe carpenda membris minutioribus oratio est*.

THIS variety is of so great consequence, that it must be studied, not only in the suc­cession of long and short Sentences, but in the structure of our Sentences also. A train of Sentences, constructed in the same man­ner, and with the same number of members, whether long or short, should never be al­lowed to succeed one another. However musical each of them may be, it has a bet­ter effect to introduce even a discord, than to cloy the ear with the repetition of similar sounds: For, nothing is so tiresome as per­petual uniformity. In this article of the construction and distribution of his Sentences, Lord Shaftsbury has shown great art. In the last Lecture, I observed, that he is often guil­ty of sacrificing precision of style to pomp of expression; and that there runs through his whole manner, a stiffness and affectation, which render him very unfit to be considered as a general model. But, as his ear was fine, and as he was extremely attentive to every thing that is elegant, he has studied the pro­per intermixture of long and short Sentences, with variety and harmony in their structure, more than any other English author; and for this part of composition he deserves at­tention.

 FROM these general observations, let us now descend to a more particular considera of the qualities that are required to make a Sentence perfect. So much depends upon the proper construction of Sentences, that, in every sort of composition, we cannot be too strict in our attentions to it. For, be the subject what it will, if the Sentences be con­structed in a clumsy, perplexed, or feeble manner, it is impossible that a work, com­posed of such Sentences, can be read with pleasure, or even with profit. Whereas, by giving attention to the rules which relate to this part of style, we acquire the habit of ex­pressing ourselves with Perspicuity and Ele­gance; and, if a disorder chance to arise in some of our Sentences, we immediately see where it lies, and are able to rectify it*.

THE properties most essential to a perfect Sentence, seem to me, the four following: 1. Clearness and Precision. 2. Unity. 3. Strength. 4. Harmony. Each of these I shall illustrate separately, and at some length.

 THE first is, Clearness and Precision. The least failure here, the least degree of ambi­guity, which leaves the mind in any sort of suspence as to the meaning, ought to be avoided with the greatest care; nor is it so easy a matter to keep always clear of this, as one might, at first, imagine. Ambiguity arises from two causes: either from a wrong choice of words, or a wrong collocation of them. Of the choice of words, as far as re­gards Perspicuity, I treated fully in the last Lecture. Of the collocation of them, I am now to treat. The first thing to be studied here, is, to observe exactly the rules of gram­mar, as far as these can guide us. But as the grammar of our Language is not exten­sive, there may often be an ambiguous col­location of words, where there is no trans­gression of any grammatical rule. The re­lations which the words, or members of a period, bear to one another, cannot be point out in English, as in the Greek or Latin, by means of termination; it is ascertained only by the position in which they stand. Hence a capital rule in the arrangement of Sentences is, that the words or members most nearly related, should be placed in the Sen­tence, as near to each other as possible; so as to make their mutual relation clearly ap­pear. This is a rule not always observed, even by good writers, as strictly as it ought to be. It will be necessary to produce some instances, which will both show the import­ance  of this rule, and make the application of it be understood.

FIRST, In the position of adverbs, which are used to qualify the signification of some­thing which either precedes or follows them, there is often a good deal of nicety. By greatness, says Mr. Addison, in the Spec­tator, No. 412. I do not only mean the bulk of any single object, but the largeness of a whole view. Here the place of the adverb only, renders it a limitation of the following word, mean. I do not only mean. The question may then be put, What does he more than mean? Had he placed it after bulk, still it would have been wrong. I do not mean the bulk only of any single object. For we might then ask, What does he mean more than the bulk? Is it the colour? Or any other property? Its proper place, undoubtedly, is, after the word object. By greatness, I do not mean the bulk of any single object only; for then, when we put the question, What more does he mean than the bulk of a single object? The answer comes out exactly as the author intends, and gives it; The largeness of a whole view. ” Theism, says Lord Shaftsbury, can only be opposed to poly­theism, or atheism. Does he mean that theism is capable of nothing else, except be opposed to polytheism or atheism? This is what his words literally import, through the wrong collocation of only. He should  have said, Theism can be opposed only to polytheism or atheism. ”In like manner, Dean Swift (Project for the advancement of Religion), The Romans understood liberty, at least, as well as we. These words are capable of two different senses, according as the emphasis, in reading them, is laid upon liberty, or upon at least. In the first case, they will signify, that whatever other things we may understand better than the Romans, liberty, at least, was one thing which they understood as well as we. In the second case, they will import, that liberty was un­derstood, at least as well by them as by us; meaning, that by them it was better under­stood. If this last, as I make no doubt, was Dean Swift own meaning, the ambiguity would have been avoided, and the sense ren­dered independent of the manner of pro­nouncing, by arranging the words thus: The Romans understood liberty as well, at least, as we. The fact is, with respect to such adverbs, as, only, wholly, at least, and the rest of that tribe, that in common dis­course, the tone and emphasis we use in pro­nouncing them, generally serves to show their reference, and to make the meaning clear; and hence, we acquire a habit of throwing them in loosely in the course of a period. But, in writing, where a man speaks to the eye, and not to the ear, he ought to be more accurate; and so to connect those adverbs with the words which they qualify,  as to put his meaning out of doubt upon the first inspection."
"SECONDLY, When a circumstance is inter­posed in the middle of a Sentence, it some­times requires attention how to place it, so as to divest it of all ambiguity. For instance: Are these designs (says Lord Bolingbroke, Disser. on Parties, Dedicat.) Are these signs which any man, who is born a Bri­ton, in any circumstances, in any situation, ought to be ashamed or afraid to avow? Here we are left at a loss, whether these words, in any circumstance, in any situation, are connected with, a man born in Britain, in any circumstances, or situation, or with that man avowing his designs, in any cir­cumstances, or situation, into which he may be brought? If the latter, as seems most probable, was intended to be the mean  the arrangement ought to have been conducted thus: Are these designs, which any man who is born a Briton, ought to be ashamed or afraid, in any circumstances, in any situation, to avow? But,"
"THIRDLY, Still more attention is required to the proper disposition of the relative pro­nouns, who, which, what, whose, and of all those particles which express the connection of the parts of Speech with one another. As all reasoning depends upon this connec  we cannot be too accurate and precise here. A small error may overcloud the  meaning of the whole Sentence; and even, where the meaning is intelligible, yet where these relative particles are out of their pro­per place, we always find something awk­ward and disjointed in the Structure of the Sentence. Thus, in the Spectator (No. 54.) This kind of wit, says Mr. Addison, was very much in vogue among our country­men, about an age or two ago, who did not practise it for any oblique reason, but purely for the sake of being witty. We are at no loss about the meaning here; but the construction would evidently be mended by disposing of the circumstance, about an age or two ago, in such a manner as not to separate the relative who, from its antece­dent our countrymen; in this way: About an age or two ago, this kind of wit was very much in vogue among our country­men, who did not practise it for any ob­lique reason, but purely for the sake of being witty. Spectator, No. 412. We no where meet with a more glorious and pleasing show in nature, than what ap­pears in the heavens at the rising and set­ting of the sun, which is wholly made up of these different stains of light, that show themselves in clouds of a different situa  Which is here designed to connect with the word show, as its antecedent; but it stands so wide from it, that without a careful attention to the sense, we would be naturally led, by the rules of syntax, to re­fer it to the rising and setting of the sun, or  to the sun itself; and, hence, an indistinct­ness is thrown over the whole Sentence. The following passage in Bishop Sherlock Ser­mons    Serm. 15.) is still more cen­surable: It is folly to pretend to arm our­selves against the accidents of life, by heap up treasures, which nothing can pro­tect us against, but the good providence of our Heavenly Father. Which, always re­fers grammatically to the immediately pre­ceding substantive, which here is, trea­sures; and this would make nonsense of the whole Period. Every one feels this im­propriety. The Sentence ought to have stood thus: It is folly to pretend, by heaping up treasures, to arm ourselves against the ac­cidents of life, which nothing can protect us against but the good providence of our Heavenly Father."
"OF the like nature is the following inac­curacy of Dean Swift  He is recommend to young clergymen, to write their ser­mons fully and distinctly. Many, says he, act so directly contrary to this method, that, from a habit of saving time and paper, which they acquired at the university, they write in so diminutive a manner, that they can hardly read what they have writ­ten. He certainly does not mean, that they had acquired time and paper at the uni­versity, but that they had acquired this habit there; and therefore his words ought to have run thus: from a habit which they have  acquired at the university of saving time and paper, they write in so diminutive a manner. In another passage, the same author has left his meaning altogether uncer­tain, by misplacing a relative. It is in the conclusion of his letter to a member of par­liament, concerning the Sacramental Test: Thus I have fairly given you, Sir, my own opinion, as well as that of a great majority of both houses here, relating to this weigh­ty affair; upon which I am confident you may securely reckon. Now I ask, what it is he would have his correspondent to reckon upon, securely? The natural con­struction leads to these words, this weighty affair. But, as it would be difficult to make any sense of this, it is more probable he meant that the majority of both houses might be securely reckoned upon; though certainly this meaning, as the words are arranged, is obscurely expressed. The sen­tence would be amended by arranging thus: Thus, Sir, I have given you my own opi­nion, relating to this weighty affair, as well as that of a great majerity of both houses here; upon which I am confident you may securely reckon."
"Several other instances might be given; but I reckon those which I have produced sufficient to make the rule understood; that, in the construction of sentences, one of the first things to be attended to, is, the mar­shalling of the words in such order as shall  most clearly mark the relation of the several parts of the sentence to one another; parti­cularly, that adverbs shall always be made to adhere closely to the words which they are intended to qualify; that, where a circum­stance is thrown in, it shall never hang loose in the midst of a period, but be determined by its place to one or other member of it; and that every relative word which is used, shall instantly present its antecedent to the mind of the reader, without the least obscu­rity. I have mentioned these three cases, because I think they are the most frequent occasions of ambiguity creeping into sen­tences."
"WITH regard to Relatives, I must farther observe, that obscurity often arises from the too frequent repetition of them, particularly of the pronouns who, and they, and them, and theirs, when we have occasion to refer to different persons; as, in the following sen­tence of archbishop Tillotson   I. serm. 42.): Men look with an evil eye upon the good that is in others; and think that their reputation obscures them, and their com­mendable qualities stand in their light; and therefore they do what they can to cast a cloud over them, that the bright shining of their virtues may not obscure them. This is altogether careless writ  It renders style often obscure, always embarrassed and inelegant. When we find these personal pronouns crowding too fast  upon us, we have often no method left, but to throw the whole sentence into some other form, which may avoid those frequent refer­ences to persons who have before been men­tioned."
"ALL languages are liable to ambiguities. Quinctilian gives us some instances in the Latin, arising from faulty arrangement. A man, he tells us, ordered, by his will, to have erected for him, after his death, Statuam auream hastam tenentem; upon which arose a dispute at law, whether the whole statue, or the spear only, was to be of gold? The same author observes, very properly, that a sentence is always faulty, when the collocation of the words is ambiguous, though the sense can be gathered. If any one should say, Chremetem audivi percussisse Demeam, this is ambiguous both in sense and structure, whether Chremes or Demea gave the blow. But if this expression were used, Se vidisse hominem librum scribentem, although the meaning be clear, yet Quinctilian insists that the arrangement is wrong. Nam, says he, etiamsi librum ab homine scribi pateat, non certÃ¨ hominem a libro, malÃ¨ tamen compo­suerat, feceratque ambiguum quantum in ipso fuit. Indeed, to have the relation of every word and member of a sentence mark in the most proper and distinct manner, gives not clearness only, but grace and beau­ty to a sentence, making the mind pass  smoothly and agreeably along all the parts of it."
"I PROCEED now to the second quality of a well-arranged sentence, which I termed its Unity. This is a capital property. In eve­ry composition, of whatever kind, some gree of unity is required, in order to render it beautiful. There must be always some connecting principle among the parts. Some one object must reign and be predominant. This, as I shall hereafter shew, holds in His­tory, in Epic and Dramatic Poetry, and in all orations. But most of all, in a single sen­tence, is required the strictest unity. For the very nature of a sentence implies one propo­sition to be expressed. It may consist of parts, indeed; but these parts must be so closely bound together, as to make the impression upon the mind, of one object, not of many. Now, in order to preserve this unity of a sen­tence, the following rules must be observed:"
"IN the first place, during the course of the sentence, the scene should be changed as lit­tle as possible. We should not be hurried by sudden transitions from person to person, nor from subject to subject. There is com­monly, in every sentence, some person or thing, which is the governing word. This should be continued so, if possible, from the beginning to the end of it. Should I express myself thus: After we came to anchor, they put me on shore, where I was wel­comed  by all my friends, who received me with the greatest kindness. In this sen­tence, though the objects contained in it have a sufficient connection with each other, yet, by this manner of representing them, by shifting so often both the place and the person, we, and they, and I, and who, they appear in such a disunited view, that the sense of connection is almost lost. The sen­tence is restored to its proper unity, by turn it after the following manner: Having come to an anchor, I was put on shore, where I was welcomed by all my friends, and received with the greatest kindness. Writers who transgress this rule, for the most part transgress, at the same time."
"A SECOND rule; never to crowd into one sentence, things which have so little connec  that they could bear to be divided into two or three sentences. The violation of this rule never fails to hurt, and displease a reader. Its effect, indeed, is so bad, that, of the two, it is the safest extreme, to err rather by too many short sentences, than by one that is overloaded and embarrassed. Ex­amples abound in authors. I shall produce some, to justify what I now say. Arch­bishop Tillotson, says an Author of the History of England, died in this year. He was exceedingly beloved both by King William and Queen Mary, who nominated Dr. Tennison, Bishop of Lincoln, to suc­ceed him. Who would expect the latter  part of this sentence to follow, in conse­quence of the former? He was exceedingly beloved by both King and Queen, is the proposition of the sentence: we look for some proof of this, or at least something re­lated to it, to follow; when we are on a sudden carried off to a new proposition, who nominated Dr. Tennison to succeed him. The following is from Middleton Life of Cicero: In this uneasy state, both of his public and private life, Cicero was oppressed by a new and cruel affliction, the death of his beloved daughter Tullia; which happened soon after her divorce from Dolabella; whose manners and hu­mours were entirely disagreeable to her. The principal object in this sentence is, the death of Tullia, which was the cause of her father affliction; the date of it, as happen soon after her divorce from Dolabella, may enter into the sentence with propriety; but the subjunction of Dolabella character is foreign to the main object; and breaks the unity and compactness of the sentence total­ly, by setting a new picture before the reader. The following sentence, from a translation of Plutarch, is still worse: Their march, says the Author, speaking of the Greeks un­der Alexander, their march was through an uncultivated country, whose savage inha­bitants fared hardly, having no other riches than a breed of lean sheep, whose flesh was rank and unsavoury, by reason of their continual feeding upon sea-fish. Here  the scene is changed upon us again and again. The march of the Greeks, the description of the inhabitants through whose country they travelled, the account of their sheep, and the cause of their sheep being ill-tasted food, form a jumble of objects, slightly related to each other, which the reader cannot, with­out much difficulty, comprehend under one view."
"THESE examples have been taken from sentences of no great length, yet over-crowd  Authors who deal in long sentences, are very apt to be faulty in this article. One need only open Lord Clarendon History, to find examples every where. The long, in­volved, and intricate sentences of that Au­thor, are the greatest blemish of his compo­sition; though, in other respects, as a Histo­rian, he has considerable merit. In later, and more correct writers than Lord Claren­don, we find a period sometimes running out so far, and comprehending so many particu­lars, as to be more properly a discourse than a sentence. Take, for an instance, the fol­lowing from Sir William Temple, in his Es­say upon Poetry: The usual acceptation takes Profit and Pleasure for two different things; and not only calls the followers or votaries of them by the several names of Busy and Idle Men; but distinguishes the faculties of the mind, that are conversant about them, calling the operations of the first, Wisdom; and of the other, Wit;  which is a Saxon word, used to express what the Spaniards and Italians call Inge­nio, and the French, Esprit, both from the Latin; though I think Wit more particu­larly signifies that of Poetry, as may occur in Remarks on the Runic Language. When one arrives at the end of such a puz­zled sentence, he is surprised to find himself got to so great a distance from the object with which he at first set out."
"LORD SHAFTSBURY, often betrayed into faults by his love of magnificence, shall afford us the next example. It is in his Rhapsody, where he is describing the cold regions: At length, says he, the Sun approaching, melts the snow, sets longing men at liber­ty, and affords them means and time to make provision against the next return of Cold. This first sentence is correct enough; but he goes on: It breaks the icy fetters of the main, where vast sea-monsters pierce through floating islands, with arms which can withstand the crystal rock; whilst others, who of themselves seem great as islands, are by their bulk alone armed against all but Man, whose superi­ority over creatures of such stupendous size and force, should make him mindful of his privilege of Reason, and force him humbly to adore the great Composer of these wondrous frames, and the Author of his own superior wisdom. Nothing can be more unhappy or embarrassed than this  sentence; the worse too, as it is intended to be descriptive, where every thing should be clear. It forms no distinct image whatever. The It, at the beginning, is ambiguous, whe­ther it mean the Sun or the Cold. The ob­ject is changed three times in the sentence; beginning with the Sun, which breaks the icy fetters of the main; then the Sea-mon­sters become the principal personages; and lastly, by a very unexpected transition, Man is brought into view, and receives a long and serious admonition before the sentence closes. I do not at present insist on the impropriety of such expressions as, God being the Com­poser of Frames; and the Sea-monsters hav arms that withstand rocks. Shaftsbury strength lay in reasoning and sentiment, more than in description; however much his descriptions have been sometimes admired."
"I SHALL only give one instance more on this head, from Dean Swift; in his proposal, too, for correcting the English Language: where, in place of a sentence, he has given a loose dissertation upon several subjects. Speaking of the progress of our language, after the time of Cromwell: To this suc­ceeded, says he, that licentiousness, which entered with the Restoration, and, from infecting our religion and morals, fell to corrupt our language; which last was not like to be much improved by those, who at that time made up the court of King Charles the Second; either such as  had followed him in his banishment, or who had been altogether conversant in the dialect of these fanatic times; or young men, who had been educated in the same country: so that the Court, which used to be the standard of correctness and pro­priety of speech, was then, and I think has ever since continued, the worst school in England for that accomplishment; and so will remain, till better care be taken in the education of our nobility, that they may set out into the world with some foun­dation of literature, in order to qualify them for patterns of politeness. How many different facts, reasonings, and observa­tions, are here presented to the mind at once! and yet so linked together by the Author, that they all make parts of a sentence, which admits of no greater division in pointing, than a semicolon between any of its members? Having mentioned pointing, I shall here take notice, that it is in vain to propose, by arbi­trary punctuation, to amend the defects of a Sentence, to correct its ambiguity, or to pre­vent its confusion. For commas, colons, and points, do not make the proper divisions of thought; but only serve to mark those which arise from the tenor of the Author expres­sion: and, therefore, they are proper or not, just according as they correspond to the na­tural divisions of the sense. When they are inserted in wrong places, they deserve, and will meet with, no regard."
" I PROCEED to a third rule, for preserving the Unity of Sentences; which is, to keep clear of all Parentheses in the middle of them. On some occasions, these may have a spirited appearance; as prompted by a certain viva­city of thought, which can glance happily aside, as it is going along. But, for the most part, their effect is extremely bad; being a sort of wheels within wheels; sentences in the midst of sentences; the perplexed me­thod of disposing of some thought, which a writer wants art to introduce in its proper place. It were needless to give many in­stances, as they occur so often among incor­rect writers. I shall produce one from Lord Bolingbroke, the rapidity of whose genius, and manner of writing, betrays him frequent­ly into inaccuracies of this sort. It is in the Introduction to his Idea of a Patriot King, where he writes thus: It seems to me, that, in order to maintain the system of the world, at a certain point, far below that of ideal perfection (for we are made capa­ble of conceiving what we are incapable of attaining), but, however, sufficient, up­on the whole, to constitute a state easy and happy, or at the worst, tolerable; I say, it seems to me, that the Author of Nature has thought fit to mingle, from time to time, among the societies of men, a few, and but a few, of those on whom he is graciously pleased to bestow a larger portion of the Ethereal Spirit, than is giv­en, in the ordinary course of his govern­ment,  to the sons of men. A very bad Sentence this; into which, by the help of a Parenthesis, and other interjected circum­stances, his Lordship had contrived to thrust so many things, that he is forced to begin the construction again with the phrase I say; which, whenever it occurs, may be always assumed as a sure mark of a clumsy ill-con­structed Sentence; excusable in speaking, where the greatest accuracy is not expected, but in polished writing, unpardonable."
"I SHALL add only one rule more for the Unity of a Sentence, which is, to bring it always to a full and perfect close. Every thing that is one, should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. I need not take notice, that an unfinished Sentence is no Sentence at all, according to any grammatical rule. But very often we meet with Sentences that are, so to speak, more than finished. When we have arrived at what we expected was to be the conclusion, when we have come to the word on which the mind is naturally led, by what went before, to rest; unexpectedly, some circumstance pops out, which ought to have been omitted, or to have been disposed of elsewhere; but which is left lagging be­hind, like a tail adjected to the Sentence; somewhat that, as Mr. Pope describes the Alexandrine line,"
"Like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along."
" All these adjections to the proper close, dis­figure a Sentence extremely. They give it a lame ungraceful air, and, in particular, they break its Unity. Dean Swift, for instance, in his Letter to a Young Clergyman, speak of Cicero writings, expresses himself thus: With these writings, young divines are more conversant, than with those of Demosthenes, who, by many degrees, ex­celled the other; at least, as an orator. Here the natural close of the Sentence is at these words, excelled the other. These words conclude the proposition; we look for no more; and the circumstance added, at least, as an orator, comes in with a very halting pace. How much more compact would the Sentence have been, if turned thus: With these writings, young divines are more conversant, than with those of Demosthenes, who, by many degrees, as an orator at least, excelled the other. In the following Sentence, from Sir William Temple, the adjection to the Sentence is al­together foreign to it. Speaking of Burnet Theory of the Earth, and Fontenelle Plu­rality of Worlds, The first, says he, could not end his learned treatise, without a panegyric of modern learning, in com­parison of the ancient  and the other, falls so grossly into the censure of the old poe­try, and preference of the new, that I could not read either of these strains without some indignation; which no quality among  men is so apt to raise in me as self-suffici­ency. The word indignation, con­cluded the Sentence; the last member, which no quality among men is so apt to raise in me as self-sufficiency, is a pro­position altogether new, added after the proper close."
"LECTURE XII. STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES."
"HAVING treated of Perspicuity and Uni­ty, as necessary to be studied in the Structure of Sentences, I proceed to the third quality of a correct Sentence, which I termed Strength. By this, I mean, such a disposi of the several words and members, as shall bring out the sense to the best advant­age; as shall render the impression, which the Period is designed to make, most full and complete; and give every word, and every member, its due weight and force. The two former qualities of Perspicuity and Unity, are, no doubt, absolutely necessary to the production of this effect; but more is still requisite. For a Sentence may be clear enough; it may also be compact enough, in all its parts, or have the requisite unity; and yet, by some unfavourable circumstance in the structure, it may fail in that strength or  liveliness of impression, which a more happy arrangement would have produced."
"THE first rule which I shall give, for pro­moting the Strength of a Sentence, is, to prune it of all redundant words. These may, sometimes, be consistent with a consi­derable degree both of Clearness and Unity; but they are always enfeebling. They make the Sentence move along tardy and encum­bered;"
"Est brevitate opus, ut currat sententia, neu se"
"Impediat verbis, lassas onerantibus aures*."
"It is a general maxim, that any words, which do not add some importance to the meaning of a Sentence, always spoil it. They cannot be superfluous, without being hurtful. Ob­stat, says Quinctilian, quicquid non juvat. All that can be easily supplied in the mind, is better left out in the expression. Thus: Content with deserving a triumph, he refused the honour of it, is better Lan­guage than to say, Being content with serving a triumph, he refused the honour of it. I consider it, therefore, as one of the most useful exercises of correction, upon reviewing what we have written or compos  to contract that round-about method of expression, and to lop off those useless ex­crescences  which are commonly found in a first draught. Here a severe eye should be employed; and we shall always find our Sentences acquire more vigour and energy when thus retrenched; provided always, that we run not into the extreme of pruning so very close, as to give a hardness and dryness to style. For here, as in all other things, there is a due medium. Some regard, though not the principal, must be had to fullness and swelling of sound. Some leaves must be left to shelter and surround the fruit."
"AS Sentences should be cleared of redun­dant words, so also of redundant members. As every word ought to present a new idea, so every member ought to contain a new thought. Opposed to this, stands the fault we sometimes meet with, of the last member of a period, being no other than the echo of the former, or the repetition of it in some­what a different form. For example; speak of Beauty, The very first discovery of it, says Mr. Addison, strikes the mind with inward joy, and spreads delight through all its faculties. (No. 412) And elsewhere, It is impossible for us to behold the divine works with coldness or indifference, or to survey so many beauties, without a secret satisfaction and complacency. (No. 413) In both these instances, little or nothing is added by the second member of the Sentence to what was already expressed in the first:  And though the free and flowing manner of such an author as Mr. Addison, and the graceful harmony of his period, may palliate such negligences; yet, in general, it holds, that style, freed from this prolixity, appears both more strong, and more beautiful. The attention becomes remiss, the mind falls into inaction, when words are multiplied without a corresponding multiplication of ideas."
"AFTER removing superfluities, the second direction I give, for promoting the Strength of a Sentence, is, to attend particularly to the use of copulatives, relatives, and all the particles employed for transition and connec  These little words, but, and, which, whose, where,   are frequently the most important words of any; they are the joints or hinges upon which all Sentences turn, and, of course, much, both of their gracefulness and strength, must depend upon such parti­cles. The varieties in using them are, in­deed, so infinite, that no particular system of rules, respecting them, can be given. At­tention to the practice of the most accurate writers, joined with frequent trials of the different effects, produced by a different usage of those particles, must here direct us*. Some observations, I shall mention, which have occurred to me as useful, without pre­tending to exhaust the subject."
" WHAT is called splitting of particles, or separating a preposition from the noun which it governs, is always to be avoided. As if I should say, Though virtue borrows no as­sistance from, yet it may often be accom­panied by, the advantages of fortune. In such instances, we feel a sort of pain, from the revulsion, or violent separation of two things, which, by their nature, should be closely united. We are put to a stand be closely united. We are put to a stand in thought; being obliged to rest for a little on the preposition by itself, which, at the same time, carries no significancy, till it is joined to its proper substantive noun."
"SOME writers needlessly multiply demon­strative and relative particles, by the frequent use of such phraseology as this: There is nothing which disgusts us sooner than the empty pomp of Language. In introduc a subject, or laying down a proposition, to which we demand particular attention, this sort of style is very proper; but, in the ordinary current of discourse, it is better to express ourselves more simply and shortly: Nothing disgusts us sooner than the empty pomp of Language."
"OTHER writers make a practice of omit­ting the Relative, in a phrase of a different kind from the former, where they think the meaning can be understood without it. As, The man I love. ” The dominions we possessed, and the conquests we made.  But though this elliptical style be intelligible, and is allowable in conversation and episto­lary writing, yet, in all writings of a serious or dignified kind, it is ungraceful. There, the Relative should always be inserted in its proper place, and the construction filled up: The man whom I love. ” The dominions which we possessed, and the conquests which we made."
"WITH regard to the Copulative particle, and, which occurs so frequently in all kinds of composition, several observations are to be made. First, It is evident, that the un­necessary repetition of it enfeebles style. It has the same sort of effect, as the frequent use of the vulgar phrase, and so, when one is telling a story in common conversation. We shall take a Sentence from Sir William Temple, for an instance. He is speaking of the refinement of the French Language: The academy set up by Cardinal Richlieu, to amuse the wits of that age and country, and divert them from raking into his poli­tics and ministry, brought this into vogue; and the French wits have, for this last age, been wholly turned to the refinement of their Style and Language; and, indeed, with such success, that it can hardly be equalled, and runs equally through their verse and their prose. Here are no fewer than eight ands in one sentence. This agree­able writer too often makes his sentences drag in this manner, by a careless multiplication  of Copulatives. It is strange how a writer, so accurate as Dean Swift, should have stum­bled on so improper an application of this particle, as he has made in the following sen­tence; Essay on the Fates of Clergymen. There is no talent so useful towards rising in the world, or which puts men more out of the reach of fortune, than that quality generally possest by the dullest sort of peo­ple, and is, in common language, called Discretion; a species of lower prudence, by the assistance of which,   By the insertion of, and is, in place of, which is, he has not only clogged the Sentence, but even made it ungrammatical."
"BUT, in the next place, it is worthy of observation, that though the natural use of the conjunction, and, be to join objects to­gether, and thereby, as one would think, to make their connection more close; yet, in fact, by dropping the conjunction, we often mark a closer connection  a quicker successi­on of objects, than when it is inserted be­tween them. Longinus makes this remark; which from many instances, appears to be just: Veni, vidi, vici*, expresses with more spirit, the rapidity and quick succession of conquest, than if connecting particles had been used. So, in the following description of a rout in Caesar Commentaries: Nos­tri, emissis pilis, gladiis rem gerunt; re­pente  post tergum equitatus cernitur; co­hortes aliae appropinquant. Hostes terga vertunt; fugientibus equites occurrunt; sit magna caedes. Bell. Gall.  7*."
"HENCE, it follows, that when, on the other hand, we seek to prevent a quick transition from one object to another, when we are making some enumeration, in which we wish that the objects should appear as distinct from each other as possible, and that the mind should rest, for a moment, on each object by itself; in this case, Copulatives may be mul­tiplied with peculiar advantage and grace. As when Lord Bolingbroke says, Such a man might fall a victim to power; but truth, and reason, and liberty, would fall with him. In the same manner, Caesar describes an engagement with the Nervii: His equitibus facile pulsis ac proturbatis, incredibile celeritate flumen decurre­runt; ut pene uno tempore, et silvas, et in flumine, et jam in manibus nostris, hostes viderentur. Bell. Gall.  2  . Here, although he is describing a quick suc­cession  of events, yet, as it is his intention to show in how many places the enemy seem to be at one time, the Copulative is very happily redoubled, in order to paint more strongly the distinction of these several places."
"THIS attention to the several cases, when it is proper to emit, and when to redouble the Copulative, is of considerable importance to all who study eloquence. For, it is a re­markable particularity in Language, that the omission of a connecting particle should some­times serve to make objects appear more close­ly connected; and that the repetition of it should distinguish and separate them, in some measure, from each other. Hence, the omis­sion of it is used to denote rapidity; and the repetition of it is designed to retard and to aggravate. The reason seems to be, that, in the former case, the mind is supposed to be hurried so fast through a quick succession of objects, that it has not leisure to point out their connection  it drops the Copulatives in its hurry; and crowds the whole series toge­ther, as if it were but one object. Whereas, when we enumerate, with a view to aggra­vate, the mind is supposed to proceed with a more slow and solemn pace; it marks fully the relation of each object to that which succeeds it; and, by joining them together with several Copulatives, makes you attend, that the objects, though connected, are yet, in themselves, distinct; that they are many,  not one. Observe, for instance, in the fol­lowing enumeration, made by the Apostle Paul, what additional weight and distinctness is given to each particular, by the repetition of a conjunction. I am perswaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre­sent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God. Rom.  38, 39. So much with regard to the use of Copulatives."
"I PROCEED to a third rule, for promoting the strength of a Sentence, which is, to dis­pose of the capital word, or words, in that place of the Sentence, where they will make the fullest impression. That such capital words there are in every Sentence, on which the meaning principally rests, every one must see; and that these words should possess a conspicuous and distinguished place, is equal­ly plain. Indeed, that place of the Sentence where they will make the best figure, whe­ther the beginning, or the end, or, some­times, even the middle, cannot, as far as I know, be ascertained by any precise rule. This must vary with the nature of the Sen­tence. Perspicuity must ever be studied in the first place; and the nature of our Lan­guage allows no great liberty in the choice of collocation. For the most part, with us, the important words are placed in the beginning of the Sentence. So Mr. Addison: The  pleasures of the imagination, taken in their full extent, are not so gross as those of sense, nor so refined as those of the understand  And this, indeed, seems the most plain and natural order, to place that in the front which is the chief object of the propo­sition we are laying down. Sometimes, how­ever, when we intend to give weight to a Sentence, it is of advantage to suspend the meaning for a little, and then bring it out full at the close: Thus, says Mr. Pope, on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us, is, his wonder­ful invention. (Pref. to Homer.)"
"THE Greek and Latin writers had a con­siderable advantage above us, in this part of style. By the great liberty of inversion, which their Languages permitted, they could chuse the most advantageous situation for every word; and had it thereby in their pow­er to give their Sentences more force. Mil­ton, in his prose works, and some other of our old English writers, endeavoured to imi­tate them in this. But the forced construc­tions, which they employed, produced ob­scurity; and the genius of our Language, as it is now written and spoken, will not admit such liberties. Mr. Gordon, who followed this inverted style in his Translation of Ta­citus, has, sometimes, done such violence to the Language, as even to appear ridiculous; as in this expression: Into this hole thrust themselves three Roman senators He has  translated so simple a phrase as, Nullum eÃ¢ tempestate bellum, by, War at that time there was none. However, within certain bounds, and to a limited degree, our Language does admit of inversions; and they are practised with success by the best writers. So Mr. Pope, speaking of Homer, The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with him, but his invention remains yet unrival­led. It is evident, that, in order to give the Sentence its due force, by contrasting properly the two capital words, judgment and invention, this is a happier arrange­ment than if he had followed the natural order, which was, Virgil has justly contest with him the praise of judgment, but his invention remains yet unrivalled."
"SOME writers practise this degree of inver­sion, which our Language bears, much more than others; Lord Shaftsbury, for instance, much more than Mr. Addison; and to this sort of arrangement is owing, in a great mea­sure, that appearance of strength, dignity, and varied harmony, which Lord Shaftsbu­ry style possesses. This will appear from the following Sentences of his Enquiry into Virtue; where all the words are placed, not strictly in the natural order, but with that artificial construction, which may give the period most emphasis and grace. He is speak of the misery of vice: This, as to the complete immoral state, is, what of their own accord, men readily remark. Where  there is this absolute degeneracy, this total apostacy from all candor, trust, or equity, there are few who do not see and acknow­ledge the misery which is consequent. Seldom is the case misconstrued, when at worst. The misfortune is, that we look not on this depravity, nor consider how it stands, in less degrees. As if, to be abso­lutely immoral, were, indeed, the greatest misery; but, to be so in a little degree, should be no misery or harm at all. Which, to allow, is just as reasonable as to own, that  it is the greatest ill of a body to be in the utmost manner maimed or distorted; but that, to lose the use only of one limb, or to be impaired in some single organ or member, is no ill worthy the least notice.     [...].) Here is no violence done to the Language, though there are many inver­sions. All is stately, and arranged with art; which is the great characteristic of this au­thor Style."
"WE need only open any page of Mr. dison, to see quite a different order in the construction of Sentences. Our sight is the most perfect, and most delightful of all our senses. It fills the mind with the largest variety of ideas, converses with its objects at the greatest distance, and conti­nues the longest in action, without being tired, or satiated with its proper enjoy­ments. The sense of feeling can, indeed, give us a notion of extension, shape, and  all other ideas that enter at the eye, except colours; but, at the same time, it is very much straitened and confined in its opera­tions,   (Spectator, No. 411.) In this strain, he always proceeds, following the most natural and obvious order of the Language: and if, by this means, he has less pomp and majesty than Shaftsbury, he has, in return, more nature, more ease and simplicity; which are beauties of a higher order."
"BUT whether we practise inversion or not, and in whatever part of the sentence we dis­pose of the capital words, it is always a point of great moment, that these capital words shall stand clear and disentangled from any other words that would clog them. Thus, when there are any circumstances of time, place, or other limitations, which the prin­cipal object of our Sentence requires to have connected with it, we must take especial care to dispose of them, so as not to cloud that principal object, nor to bury it under a load of circumstances. This will be made clearer by an example. Observe the arrangement of the following Sentence, in Lord Shaftsbury Advice to an Author. He is speaking of modern poets, as compared with the anti­ent: If, whilst they profess only to please, they secretly advise, and give instruction, they may now, perhaps, as well as former­ly, be esteemed, with justice, the best and most honourable among authors. This is a well-constructed Sentence. It contains a  great many circumstances and adverbs, ne­cessary to qualify the meaning; only, secretly, as well, perhaps, now, with justice, formerly; yet these are placed with so much art, as neither to embarrass, nor weaken the Sen­tence; while that which is the capital object in it, viz. Poets being justly esteemed the best and most honourable among authors, comes out in the conclusion clear and detach  and possesses its proper place. See, now, what would have been the effect of a differ­ent arrangement. Suppose him to have placed the members of the Sentence thus: If, whilst they profess to please only, they advise and give instruction secretly, they may be esteemed the best and most ho­nourable among authors, with justice, per­haps, now, as well as formerly. Here we have precisely the same words, and the same sense; but, by means of the circumstances being so intermingled as to clog the capital words, the whole becomes perplexed, with­out grace, and without strength."
"A FOURTH rule, for constructing Sentences with proper strength, is, to make the mem­bers of them go on rising and growing in their importance above one another. This sort of arrangement is called a Climax, and is always considered as a beauty in composition. From what cause it pleases, is abundantly evident. In all things, we naturally love to ascend to what is more and more beautiful, rather than to follow the retrograde order. Having had  once some considerable object set before us, it is, with pain, we are pulled back to attend to an inferior circumstance. Cavendum est, says Quinctilian, whose authority I always willingly quote, ne decrescat oratio, & fortiori subjungatur aliquid infirmius; sicut, sacrilego, fur; aut latroni petulans. Augeri enim debent sententiae & insur­gere*. Of this beauty, in the construc of Sentences, the orations of Cicero fur­nish many examples. His pompous manner naturally led him to study it; and, generally, in order to render the climax perfect, he makes both the sense and the sound rise to­gether, with a very magnificent swell. So in his oration for Milo, speaking of a design of Clodius for assassinating Pompey: Atqui si res, si vir, si tempus ullum dignum fuit, certÃ¨ haec in illÃ¢ causÃ¢ summa omnia fue­runt. Insidiator erat in Foro collocatus, atque in Vestibulo ipso SenatÃ  ei' viro autem mors parabatur, cujus in vitÃ¢ nite­batur salus civitatis; eo porrÃ² reipublicae tempore, quo si unus ille occidisset, non haec solÃ civitas, sed gentes omnes con­cidissent. The following instance, from Lord Bolingbroke, is also beautiful: This decency, this grace, this propriety of man­ners to character, is so essential to princes  in particular, that, whenever it is neglect  their virtues lose a great degree of lus­tre, and their defects acquire much aggra­vation. Nay more; by neglecting this cency and this grace, and for want of a sufficient regard to appearances, even their virtues may betray them into failings, their failings into vices, and their vices into ha­bits unworthy of princes, and unworthy of men. (Idea of a Patriot King.)

I MUST observe, however, that this sort of full and oratorial climax, can neither be always obtained, nor ought to be always sought after. Only some kinds of writing admit such sentences; and, to study them too frequently, especially if the subject require not so much pomp, is affected and disagree­able. But there is something approaching to a climax, which it is a general rule to study, ne decrescat oratio, as Quinctilian speaks, et ne fortiori subjungatur aliquid infirmi­us. A weaker assertion or proposition should never come after a stronger one; and when our sentence consists of two members, the longest should, generally, be the con­cluding one. There is a twofold reason for this last direction. Periods, thus divided, are pronounced more easily; and the shortest member being placed first, we carry it more readily in our memory as we proceed to the second, and see the connection of the two more clearly. Thus, to say, when our passions have forsaken us, we flatter our­selves  with the belief that we have forsaken them, is both more graceful and more clear, than to begin with the longest part of the proposition: We flatter ourselves with the belief that we have forsaken our passions, when they have forsaken us. In general, it is always agreeable to find a sentence rising upon us, and growing in its importance to the very last word, when this construction can be managed without affec­tation, or unseasonable pomp. If we rise yet higher, says Mr. Addison, very beautifully, and consider the fixed stars as so many oceans of flame, that are each of them attended with a different set of pla­nets; and still discover new firmaments and new lights, that are sunk farther in those unfathomable depths of aether; we are lost in such a labyrinth of suns and worlds, and confounded with the magni­ficence and immensity of Nature (Spect. No. 420). Hence follows clearly,

A FIFTH rule for the strength of sentences; which is, to avoid concluding them with an adverb, a preposition, or any inconsiderable word. Such conclusions are always enfee­bling and degrading. There are sentences, indeed, where the stress and significancy rest chiefly upon some words of this kind. In this case, they are not to be considered as cir­cumstances, but as the capital figures; and ought, in propriety, to have the principal place allotted them. No fault, for instance,  can be found with this sentence of Boling­broke  In their prosperity, my friends shall never hear of me; in their adversity, always. Where never, and always, being emphatical words, were to be so placed, as to make a strong impression. But I speak now of those inferior parts of speech, when introduced as circumstances, or as qualifica­tions of more important words. In such case, they should always be disposed of in the least conspicuous parts of the period; and so classed with other words of greater dignity, as to be kept in their proper second­ary station.

AGREEABLY to this rule, we should al­ways avoid concluding with any of those particles, which mark the cases of nouns, ”of, to, from, with, by. For instance, it is a great deal better to say, Avarice is a crime of which wise men are often guilty, than to say, Avarice is a crime which wise men are often guilty of. This is a phraseology which all correct writers shun; and with reason. For, besides the want of dignity which arises from those monosyllables at the end, the imagination cannot avoid resting, for a little, on the import of the word which closes the sentence. And, as those prepo­sitions have no import of their own, but on­ly serve to point out the relations of other words, it is disagreeable for the mind to be left pausing on a word, which does not, by  itself, produce any idea, nor form any picture in the fancy.

FOR the same reason, verbs which are used in a compound sense, with some of these prepositions, are, though not so bad, yet still not so beautiful conclusions of a period; such as, bring about, lay hold of, come over to, clear up, and many other of this kind: in­stead of which, if we can employ a simple verb, it always terminates the sentence with more strength. Even the pronoun, It, though it has the import of a substantive noun, and indeed often forces itself upon us unavoida­bly, yet, when we want to give dignity to a sentence, should, if possible, be avoided in the conclusion; more especially, when it is joined with some of the prepositions, as, with it, in it, to it. In the following sen­tence of the Spectator, which otherwise is abundantly noble, the bad effect of this close is sensible: There is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and triumphant considera in religion, than this, of the perpetual progress which the soul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever ar­riving at a period in it. (No. III.) How much more graceful the sentence, if it had been so constructed as to close with the word, period!

BESIDES particles and pronouns, any phrase, which expresses a circumstance on­ly, always brings up the rear of a sentence  with a bad grace. We may judge of this, by the following sentence from Lord Boling­broke (Letter on the State of Parties at the Accession of King George I.): Let me therefore conclude by repeating, that di­vision has caused all the mischief we ment; that union alone can retrieve it; and that a great advance towards this uni­on, was the coalition of parties, so hap­pily begun, so successfully carried on, and of late so unaccountably neglected; to say no worse. This last phrase, to say no worse, occasions a sad falling off at the end; so much the more unhappy, as the rest of the period is conducted after the manner of a climax, which we expect to find growing to the last.

THE proper disposition of such circum­stances in a sentence, is often attended with considerable trouble, in order to adjust them so, as shall consist equally with the perspi­cuity and the grace of the period. Though necessary parts, they are, however, like un­shapely stones in a building, which try the skill of an artist, where to place them with the least offence. Jungantur, says Quinc­tilian, quo congruunt maximÃ¨; sicut in structurÃ¢ saxorum rudium, etiam ipsa enor­mitas invenit cui applicari, et in quo possit insistere*.

 THE close is always an unsuitable place for them. When the sense admits it, the sooner they are dispatched, generally speaking, the better; that the more important and signifi­cant words may possess the last place, quite disencumbered. It is a rule, too, never to crowd too many circumstances together, but rather to intersperse them in different parts of the sentence, joined with the capital words on which they depend; provided that care be taken, as I before directed, not to clog those capital words with them. For instance, when Dean Swift says, What I had the honour of mentioning to your Lordship, some time ago, in conversation, was not a new thought. (Letter to the Earl of Oxford.) These two circumstances, sometime ago, and in conversation, which are here put together, would have had a better effect disjoined, thus: What I had the honour, sometime ago, of mentioning to your Lordship in conversation. And in the following sen­tence of Lord Bolingbroke (Remarks on the History of England): A monarchy, limited like ours, may be placed, for aught I know, as it has been often represented, just in the middle point, from whence a deviation leads, on the one hand, to tyranny, and on the other, to anarchy. The arrange­ment would have been happier thus: A  monarchy, limited like ours, may, for aught I know, be placed, as it has often been represented, just in the middle point,  

I SHALL give only one rule more, relating to the strength of a sentence, which is, that in the members of a sentence, where two things are compared or contrasted to one an­other; where either a resemblance or an op­position is intended to be expressed; some resemblance, in the language and construc  should be preserved. For when the things themselves correspond to each other, we naturally expect to find the words corre­sponding too. We are disappointed when it is otherwise; and the comparison, or con­trast, appears more imperfect. Thus, when Lord Bolingbroke says, The laughers will be for those who have most wit; the seri­ous part of mankind, for those who have most reason on their side; (Dissert. on Parties, Pref.) the opposition would have been more complete, if he had said, The laughers will be for those who have most wit; the serious, for those who have most reason on their side. The following pas­sage from Mr. Pope Preface to his Homer, fully exemplifies the rule I am now giving: Homer was the greater genius; Virgil, the better artist: in the one, we most admire the man; in the other, the work. Homer hurries us with a commanding impetuo­sity; Virgil leads us with an attractive  majesty. Homer scatters with a generous profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence. Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches with a sudden overflow; Vir­gil, like a river in its banks, with a constant stream. ”And when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Ju­piter in his terrors, shaking Olympus, scat­tering the lightnings, and firing the hea­vens; Virgil, like the same Power, in his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans for empires, and ordering his whole creation. ”Periods thus construct  when introduced with propriety, and not returning too often, have a sensible beauty. But we must beware of carrying our atten to this beauty too far. It ought only to be occasionally studied, when comparison or opposition of objects naturally leads to it. If such a construction as this be aimed at in all our sentences, it betrays into a disagreeable uniformity; produces a regularly returning clink in the period, which tires the ear; and plainly discovers affectation. Among the an­cients, the style of Isocrates is faulty in this respect; and, on that account, by some of their best critics, particularly by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, he is severely censured.

THIS finishes what I had to say concern Sentences, considered, with respect to their meaning, under the three heads of Per­spicuity, Unity, and Strength. It is a sub­ject on which I have insisted fully, for two  reasons: First, because it is a subject, which, by its nature, can be rendered more didactic, and subjected more to precise rule, than many other subjects of criticism; and next, because it appears to me of considerable im­portance and use.

FOR, though many of those attentions, which I have been recommending, may ap­pear minute, yet their effect, upon writing and style, is much greater than might, at first, be imagined. A sentiment which is expressed in a period, clearly, neatly, and happily ar­ranged, makes always a stronger impression on the mind, than one that is any how fee­ble or embarrassed. Every one feels this upon a comparison: and if the effect be sen­sible in one sentence, how much more in a whole discourse, or composition, that is made up of such Sentences?

THE fundamental rule of the construction of Sentences, and into which all others might be resolved, undoubtedly is, to communi­cate, in the clearest and most natural order, the ideas which we mean to transfuse into the minds of others. Every arrangement that does most justice to the sense, and expresses it to most advantage, strikes us as beautiful. To this point have tended all the rules I have given. And, indeed, did men always think clearly, and were they, at the same time, fully masters of the Language in which they write, there would be occasion for few rules.  Their Sentences would then, of course, ac­quire all those properties of Precision, Unity, and Strength, which I have recommended. For we may rest assured, that, whenever we express ourselves ill, there is, besides the mis­management of Language, for the most part, some mistake in our manner of conceiving the subject. Embarrassed, obscure, and fee­ble Sentences, are generally, if not always, the result of embarrassed, obscure, and fee­ble thought. Thought and Language act and re-act upon each other mutually. Logic and Rhetoric have here, as in many other cases, a strict connection; and he that is learning to arrange his sentences with accuracy and or­der, is learning, at the same time, to think with accuracy and order; an observation which alone will justify all the care and at­tention we have bestowed on this subject.

LECTURE XIII. STRUCTURE OF SENTENCES. ”HARMONY.

HITHERTO we have considered Sen­tences, with respect to their meaning, under the heads of Perspicuity, Unity, and Strength. We are now to consider them, with respect to their sound, their harmony, or agreeableness to the ear; which was the last quality belonging to them that I proposed to treat of.

SOUND is a quality much inferior to sense; yet such as must not be disregarded. For, as long as sounds are the vehicle of convey­ance for our ideas, there will be always a very considerable connection between the idea which is conveyed, and the nature of the sound which conveys it. Pleasing ideas can hardly be transmitted to the mind, by means of harsh and disagreeable sounds. The imagination revolts as soon as it hears them  uttered. Nihil, says Quinctilian, potest intrare in affectum quod in aure, velut quodam vestibulo statim offendit*. Mu­sic has naturally a great power over all men to prompt and facilitate certain emotions: insomuch, that there are hardly any dispositi­ons which we wish to raise in others, but cer­tain sounds may be found concordant to those dispositions, and tending to promote them. Now, Language can, in some gree, be rendered capable of this power of music; a circumstance which must needs heighten our idea of Language as a wonder­ful invention. Not content with simply in­terpreting our ideas to others, it can give them those ideas enforced by corresponding sounds; and to the pleasure of communicated thought, can add the new and separate pleasure of me­lody.

IN the Harmony of Periods, two things may be considered. First, Agreeable sound, or modulation in general, without any parti­cular expression: Next, The sound so order  as to become expressive of the sense. The first is the more common; the second, the higher beauty.

FIRST, Let us consider agreeable sound, in general, as the property of a well-con­structed Sentence: and, as it was of prose  Sentences we have hitherto treated, we shall confine ourselves to them under this head. This beauty of musical construction in prose, it is plain will depend upon two things; the choice of words, and the arrangement of them.

I BEGIN with the choice of words; on which head, there is not much to be said, unless I were to descend into a tedious and frivolous detail concerning the powers of the several letters, or simple sounds, of which speech is composed. It is evident, that words are most agreeable to the ear which are com­posed of smooth and liquid sounds, where there is a proper intermixture of vowels and consonants; without too many harsh con­sonants rubbing against each other; or too many open vowels in succession, to cause a hiatus, or disagreeable aperture of the mouth. It may always be assumed as a principle, that, whatever sounds are difficult in pronunciati­on, are, in the same proportion, harsh and painful to the ear. Vowels give softness; consonants, strength to the sound of words. The music of Language requires a just pro­portion of both; and will be hurt, will be rendered either grating or effeminate, by an excess of either. Long words are commonly more agreeable to the ear than monosylla­bles. They please it by the composition, or succession of sounds which they present to it; and, accordingly, the most musical Lan­guages abound most in them. Among words  of any length, those are the most musical, which do not run wholly either upon long or short syllables, but are composed of an inter­mixture of them; such as, repent, produce, velocity, celerity, independent, impetuosity.

THE next head, respecting the Harmony which results from a proper arrangement of the words and members of a period, is more complex, and of greater nicety. For, let the words themselves be ever so well chosen, and well sounding, yet, if they be ill disposed, the music of the Sentence is utterly lost. In the harmonious structure and disposition of periods, no writer whatever, ancient or mo­dern, equals Cicero. He had studied this with care; and was fond, perhaps to excess, of what he calls, the Plena ac numerosa oratio. We need only open his writings, to find instances that will render the effect of musical Language sensible to every ear. What, for example, can be more full, round, and swelling, than the following sentence of the 4th Oration against Catiline? Cogi­tate quantis laboribus fundatum imperium, quantÃ¢ virtute stabilitam libertatem, quan­tÃ¢ Deorum benignitate auctas exaggeratas­que fortunas, una nox pene delerit. In English, we may take, for an instance of a musical Sentence, the following from Milton, in his Treatise on Education: We shall conduct you to a hill-side, laborious, in­deed, at the first ascent; but else, so smooth, so green, so full of goodly prospects, and  melodious sounds on every side, that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming. Every thing in this sentence conspires to pro­mote the harmony. The words are happily chosen; full of liquids and soft sounds; borious, smooth, green, goodly, melodious, charm  and these words so artfully arranged, that, were we to alter the collocation of any one of them, we should, presently, be sensible of the melody suffering. For, let us observe, how finely the members of the period swell one above another. So smooth, so green, ” so full of goodly prospects, ”and melodi­ous sounds on every side; ”till the ear, prepared by this gradual rise, is conducted to that full close on which it rests with plea­sure; ”that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming.

THE structure of periods, then, being sus­ceptible of a melody very sensible to the ear, our next enquiry should be, How this melo­dious structure is formed, what are the prin­ciples of it, and by what laws is it regulated? And, upon this subject, were I to follow the ancient rhetoricians, it would be easy to give a great variety of rules. For here they have entered into a minute and particular detail; more particular, indeed, than on any other head that regards Language. They hold, that to prose as well as to verse, there belong certain numbers, less strict, indeed, yet such as can be ascertained by rule. They go so far as to specify the feet, as they are called,  that is, the succession of long and short syl­lables, which should enter into the different members of a Sentence, and to show what the effect of each of these will be. Where­ever they treat of the Structure of Sentences, it is always the music of them that makes the principal object. Cicero and Quinctilian are full of this. The other qualities of Precisi­on, Unity, and Strength, which we consider as of chief importance, they handle slightly; but when they come to the junctura et nu­merus, the modulation and harmony, there they are copious. Dionysius of Halicarnas­sus, one of the most judicious critics of an­tiquity, has written a treatise on the Compo­sition of words in a Sentence, which is altoge­ther confined to their musical effect. He makes the excellency of a Sentence to consist in four things; first, in the sweetness of sin­gle sounds; secondly, in the composition of sounds, that is, the numbers or feet; thirdly, in change or variety of sound; and fourthly, in sound suited to the sense. On all these points he writes with great accuracy and re­finement; and is very worthy of being con­sulted; though, were one now to write a book on the Structure of Sentences, we should ex­pect to find the subject treated of in a more extensive manner.

IN modern times, this whole subject of the musical structure of discourse, it is plain, has been much less studied; and, indeed, for se­veral reasons, can be much less subjected to  rule. The reasons, it will be necessary to give, both to justify my not following the tract of the ancient rhetoricians on this sub­ject, and to show how it has come to pass, that a part of composition, which once made so conspicuous a figure, now draws much less attention.

IN the first place, the ancient Languages, I mean the Greek and the Roman, were much more susceptible than ours, of the graces and the powers of melody. The quan­tities of their syllables were more fixed and determined; their words were longer, and more sonorous; their method of varying the terminations of nouns and verbs, both in­troduced a greater variety of liquid sounds, and freed them from that multiplicity of lit­tle auxiliary words which we are obliged to employ; and, what is of the greatest conse­quence, the inversions which their Languages allowed, gave them the power of placing their words in whatever order was most suit to a musical arrangement. All these were great advantages which they enjoyed above us, for Harmony of Period.

IN the next place, the Greeks and Romans, the former especially, were, in truth, much more musical nations than we; their genius was more turned to delight in the melody of speech. Music is known to have been a more extensive art among them than it is with us, more universally studied, and ap­plied  to a greater variety of objects. Se­veral learned men, particularly the AbbÃ© du Bos, in his Reflections on Poetry and Paint  have clearly proved, that the theatrical compositions of the antients, both their tra­gedies and comedies, were set to a kind of music. Whence, the modos fecit, and the Tibiis dextris et sinistris, prefixed to the edi­tions of Terence Plays. All sort of decla­mation and public speaking, was carried on by them in a much more musical tone than it is among us. It approached to a kind of chanting or recitative. Among the Atheni­ans, there was what was called the Nomic Melody; or a particular measure prescribed to the public officers, in which they were to promulgate the laws to the people; lest, by reading them with improper tones, the laws might be exposed to contempt. Among the Romans, there is a noted story of  Grac­chus, when he was declaiming in public, having a musician standing at his back, in order to give him the proper tones with a pipe or flute. Even when pronouncing those terrible tribunitial harangues, by which he inflamed the one half of the citizens of Rome against the other, this attention to the music of Speech was, in those times, it seems, thought necessary to success. Quinctilian, though he condemns the excess of this sort of pronunciation, yet allows a cantus ob­scurior to be a beauty in a public speaker. Hence, that variety of accents, acute, grave, and circumflex, which we find marked upon  the Greek syllables, to express, not the quan­tity of them, but the tone in which they were to be spoken: the application of which is now wholly unknown to us. And though the Romans did not mark those accents in their writing, yet it appears, from Quincti­lian, that they used them in pronunciation: Quantum, quale, says he, comparantes gravi, interrogantes acuto tenore conclu­dunt. As music then, was an object much more attended to in Speech, among the Greeks and Romans, than it is with us; as, in all kinds of public speaking, they employed a much greater variety of notes, of tones, or inflexions of voice, than we use; this is one clear reason of their paying a greater atten to that construction of Sentences, which might best suit this musical pronunciation.

IT is farther known, that, in consequence of the genius of their Languages, and of their manner of pronouncing them, the mu­sical arrangement of Sentences, did, in fact, produce a greater effect in publick speaking among them, than it could possibly do in any modern oration; another reason why it served to be more studied. Cicero, in his treatise, intitled, Orator, tells us, Conciones saepe exclamare vidi, cum verba aptÃ¨ ceci­dissent. enim expectant aures*. And  he gives a remarkable instance of the effect of a harmonious period upon a whole assem­bly, from a Sentence of one of Carbo Ora­tions, spoken in his hearing. The Sentence was, Patris dictum sapiens temeritas filii comprobavit. By means of the sound of which, alone, he tells us, Tantus clamor concionis excitatus est, ut prorsus admira­bile esset. He makes us remark the feet of which these words consist, to which he ascribes the power of the melody; and shows how, by altering the collocation, the whole effect would be lost; as thus: Patris dic­tum sapiens comprobravit temeritas filii. Now, though it be true that Carbo Sen­tence is extremely musical, and would be agreeable, at this day, to any audience, yet I cannot believe that an English Sentence, equally harmonious, would, by its harmony alone, produce any such effect on a British audience, or excite any such wonderful ap­plause and admiration, as Cicero informs us this of Carbo produced. Our northern ears are too coarse and obtuse. The melody of Speech has less power over us; and by our simpler and plainer method of uttering words, Speech is, in truth, accompanied with less melody than it was among the Greeks and Romans*.

 FOR these reasons, I am of opinion, that it is in vain to think of bestowing the same attention upon the harmonious structure of our Sentences, that was bestowed by these ancient nations. The doctrine of the Greek and Roman critics, on this head, has misled some to imagine, that it might be equally applied to our Tongue; and that our prose writing might be regulated by Spondees and Trochees, and Iambus and Poeons, and other metrical feet. But, first, our words cannot be measured, or, at least, can be measured very imperfectly by any feet of this kind. For, the quantity, the length and shortness of our syllables, is not, by any means, so fixed and subjected to rule, as in the Greek and Roman Tongues; but very often left arbitrary, and determined by the emphasis, and the sense. Next, though our prose could admit of such metrical regulation, yet, from our plainer method of pronouncing all sort of discourse, the effect would not be at all so sensible to the ear, nor be relished with so much pleasure, as among the Greeks and Romans: And, lastly, This whole doctrine about the measures and numbers of prose, even as it is delivered by the ancient rheto­ricians themselves, is, in truth, in a great measure loose and uncertain. It appears, in­deed, that the melody of discourse was a  matter of infinitely more attention to them, than ever it has been to the moderns. But, though they write a great deal about it, they have never been able to reduce it to any rules which could be of real use in practice. If we consult Cicero Orator, where this point is discussed with the most minuteness, we will see how much these ancient critics dif­fered from one another, about the feet pro­per for the conclusion, and other parts of a Sentence; and how much, after all, was left to the judgment of the ear. Nor, indeed, is it possible to give precise rules concerning this matter, in any Language; as all prose composition must be allowed to run loose in its numbers; and, according as the tenor of a discourse varies, the modulation of Sentences must vary infinitely.

BUT, although I apprehend, that this mu­sical arrangement cannot be reduced into a system, I am far from thinking, that it is a quality to be neglected in composition. On the contrary, I hold its effect to be very con­siderable; and that every one who studies to write with grace, much more, who seeks to pronounce in public, with success, will be obliged to attend to it not a little. But it is his ear, cultivated by attention and practice, that must chiefly direct him. For any rules that can be given, on this subject, are very general. Some rules, however, there are, which may be of use to form the ear to the proper harmony of discourse. I proceed  to mention such as appear to me most mate­rial.

THERE are two things on which the mu­sic of a Sentence chiefly depends. These are, the proper distribution of the several members of it; and, the close or cadence of the whole.

FIRST, I say, the distribution of the se­veral members is to be carefully attended to. It is of importance to observe, that, whatever is easy and agreeable to the organs of Speech. always sounds grateful to the ear. While a period is going on, the termination of each of its members forms a pause, or rest, in pronouncing: and these rests should be so distributed, as to make the course of the breathing easy, and, at the same time, should fall at such distances, as to bear a certain musical proportion to each other. This will be best illustrated by examples. The follow Sentence is from Archbishop Tillotson; This discourse concerning the easiness of God commands does, all along, suppose and acknowledge the difficulties of the first entrance upon a religious course; ex­cept, only in those persons who have had the happiness to be trained up to religion by the easy and insensible degrees of a pi­ous and virtuous education. Here there is no harmony; nay, there is some degree of harshness and unpleasantness; owing princi­pally to this, that there is, properly, no more  than one pause or rest in the Sentence, fall between the two members into which it is divided; each of which is so long as to oc­casion a considerable stretch of the breath in pronouncing it.

OBSERVE, now, on the other hand, the ease with which the following Sentence, from Sir William Temple, glides along, and the graceful intervals at which the pauses are placed. He is speaking sarcastically of man: But God be thanked, his pride is greater than his ignorance, and what he wants in knowledge, he supplies by sufficiency. When he has looked about him, as far as he can, he concludes, there is no more to be seen; when he is at the end of his line, he is at the bottom of the ocean; when he has shot his best, he is sure none ever did, or ever can, shoot better, or beyond it. His own reason he holds to be the certain measure of truth; and his own knowledge, of what is possible in nature*. Here every thing is, at once,  easy to the breath, and grateful to the ear; and, it is this sort of flowing measure, this regular and proportional division of the mem­bers of his Sentences, which renders Sir William Temple style always agreeable. I must observe, at the same time, that a Sen­tence, with too many rests, and these placed at intervals too apparently measured and re­gular, is apt to savour of affectation.

THE next thing to be attended to, is, the close or cadence of the whole Sentence, which, as it is always the part most sensible to the ear, demands the greatest care. So Quinctilian: Non igitur durum sit, neque abruptum, quo animi, velut respirant ac reficiuntur. Haec est sedes orationis; hoc auditor expectat; his laus omnis decla­mat*. The only important rule that can be given here, is, that when we aim at dig­nity or elevation, the sound should be made to grow to the last; the longest members of the period, and the fullest and most sonorous words, should be reserved to the conclusion. As an example of this, the following sentence of Mr. Addison may be given: It fills  the mind (speaking of sight) with the largest variety of ideas; converses with its objects at the greatest distance; and con­tinues the longest in action, without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoy­ments. Every reader must be sensible of a beauty here, both in the proper division of the members and pauses, and the manner in which the Sentence is rounded, and conduct to a full and harmonious close.

THE same holds in melody, that I observ to take place with respect to significancy; that a falling off at the end, always hurts greatly. For this reason, particles, pronouns, and little words, are as ungracious to the ear, at the conclusion, as I formerly shewed they were inconsistent with strength of expression. It is more than probable, that the sense and the sound have here a mutual influence on each other. That which hurts the ear, seems to mar the strength of the meaning; and that which really degrades the sense, in con­sequence of this primary effect, appears also to have a bad sound. How disagreeable is the following sentence of an Author, speak of the Trinity! It is a mystery which we firmly believe the truth of, and hum­bly adore the depth of. And how easily could it have been mended by this transposi  It is a mystery, the truth of which we firmly believe, and the depth of which we humbly adore. In general it seems to hold, that a musical close, in our language,  requires either the last syllable, or the penult, that is, the last but one, to be a long syllable. Words which consist mostly of short syllables, as, contrary, particular, retrospect, seldom conclude a sentence harmoniously, unless a run of long syllables, before, has rendered them agreeable to the ear.

IT is necessary, however, to observe, that Sentences, so constructed as to make the sound always swell and grow towards the end, and to rest either on a long or a penult long syllable, give a discourse the tone of decla­mation. The ear soon becomes acquainted with the melody, and is apt to be cloyed with it. If we would keep up the attention of the reader or hearer, if we would preserve vivacity and strength in our composition, we must be very attentive to vary our measures. This regards the distribution of the members, as well as the cadence of the period. Sen­tences constructed in a similar manner, with the pauses falling at equal intervals, should never follow one another. Short Sentences should be intermixed with long and swelling ones, to render discourse sprightly, as well as magnificent. Even discords, properly in­troduced, abrupt sounds, departures from re­gular cadence, have sometimes a good effect. Monotony is the great fault into which wri­ters are apt to fall, who are fond of harmo­nious arrangement: and to have only one tune, or measure, is not much better than having none at all. A very vulgar ear will  enable a writer to catch some one melody, and to form the run of his Sentences accord to it; which soon proves disgusting. But a just and correct ear is requisite for varying and diversifying the melody: and hence we so seldom meet with authors, who are re­markably happy in this respect.

THOUGH attention to the music of Sen­tences must not be neglected, yet it must also be kept within proper bounds: for all appearances of an author affecting harmony, are disagreeable; especially when the love of it betrays him so far, as to sacrifice, in any instance, perspicuity, precision, or strength of sentiment, to sound. All unmeaning words, introduced merely to round the period, or fill up the melody, complementa numerorum, as Cicero calls them, are great blemishes in writ  They are childish and puerile orna­ments, by which a Sentence always loses more in point of weight, than it can gain by such additions to the beauty of its sound Sense has its own harmony, as well as sound; and, where the sense of a period is expressed with clearness, force, and dignity, it will seldom happen but the words will strike the ear agreeably; at least, a very moderate atten is all that is requisite for making the ca­dence of such a period pleasing: and the ef­fect of greater attention is often no other, than to render composition languid and ener­vated. After all the labour which Quinctilian bestows on regulating the measures of prose,  he comes at last, with his usual good sense, to this conclusion: In universum, si sit necesse, duram potiÃ atque asperam com­positionem malim esse, quam effeminatam ac enervem, qualis apud multos. IdeÃ²que, vincta quaedam industria sunt solvenda, ne laborata videantur; neque ullum ido­neum aut aptum verbum praetermittamus, gratiÃ¢ lenitatis*.   ix.  4.)

CICERO, as I before observed, is one of the most remarkable patterns of a harmoni­ous style. His love of it, however, is too visible; and the pomp of his numbers some­times detracts from his strength. That noted close of his, esse videatur, which, in the Ora Pro Lege Manilia, occurs eleven times, exposed him to censure among his cotempora­ries. We must observe, hewever, in defence of this great Orator, that there is a remarka­ble union in his style, of harmony with ease, which is always a great beauty; and if his harmony be sometimes thought studied, that study appears to have cost him little trou­ble.

 AMONG our English classics, not many are distinguished for musical arrangement. Mil­ton, in some of his prose works, has very finely turned periods; but the writers of his age indulged a liberty of inversion, which now would be reckoned contrary to purity of style: and though this allowed their Sen­tences to be more stately and sonorous, yet it gave them too much of a Latinized con­struction and order. Of later writers, Shafts­bury is, upon the whole, the most correct in his numbers. As his ear was delicate, he has attended to music in all his Sentences; and he is peculiarly happy in this respect, that he has avoided the monotony into which writ­ers, who study the grace of sound, are very apt to fall: having diversified his periods with great variety. Mr. Addison has also much harmony in his style; more easy and smooth, but less varied, than Lord Shaftsbu­ry. Sir William Temple is, in general, very flowing and agreeable. Archbishop Tillotson is too often careless and languid; and is much outdone by Bishop Atterbury in the music of his periods. Dean Swift despised musical ar­rangement altogether.

HITHER TO I have discoursed of agreeable sound, or modulation, in general. It yet re­mains to treat of a higher beauty of this kind; the sound adapted to the sense. The former was no more than a simple accom­paniment, to please the ear; the latter sup­poses a peculiar expression given to the mu­sic.  We may remark two degrees of it: First, the current of sound, adapted to the tenor of a discourse; next, a particular resemblance effected between some object, and the sounds that are employed in describing it.

FIRST, I say, the current of sound may be adapted to the tenor of a discourse. Sounds have, in many respects, a correspondence with our ideas; partly natural, partly the effect of artificial associations. Hence it hap­pens, that any one modulation of sound con­tinued, imprints on our Style a certain cha­racter and expression. Sentences construct with the Ciceronian fulness and swell, pro­duce the impression of what is important, magnificent, sedate. For this is the natural tone which such a course of sentiment as­sumes. But they suit no violent passion, no eager reasoning, no familiar address. These always require measures brisker, easier, and often more abrupt. And, therefore, to swell, or to let down the periods, as the subject mands, is a very important rule in oratory. No one tenor whatever, supposing it to pro­duce no bad effect from satiety, will answer to all different compositions; nor even to all the parts of the same composition. It were as absurd to write a panegyric, and an invec­tive, in a Style of the same cadence, as to set the words of a tender love-song to the air of a warlike march.

 OBSERVE how finely the following sen­tence of Cicero is adapted, to represent the tranquillity and ease of a satisfied state: Etsi homini nihil est magis optandum quam prospera, aequabilis, perpetuaque fortuna, secundo vitae sine ulla offensione cursu; tamen, si mihi tranquilla et placata omnia fuissent, incredibili quÃ¢dam et pene divinÃ¢, quÃ¢ nunc vestro beneficio fruor, laetitiae vo­luptate caruissem*. Nothing was ever more perfect in its kind: it paints, if we may so speak, to the ear. But, who would not have laughed, if Cicero had employed such periods, or such a cadence as this, in inveighing against Mark Antony, or Cati­line? What is requisite, therefore, is, that we previously fix, in our mind, a just idea of the general tone of sound which suits our subject; that is, which the sentiments we are to express, most naturally assume, and in which they most commonly vent them­selves; whether round and smooth, or state­ly and solemn, or brisk and quick, or inter­rupted and abrupt. This general idea must direct the run of our composition; to speak in the style of music, must give us the key note, must form the ground of the melody; varied and diversified in parts, according as either our sentiments are diversified, or as is requisite for producing a suitable variety to gratify the car.

 IT may be proper to remark, that our translators of the Bible have often been hap­py in suiting their numbers to the subject. Grave, solemn, and majestic subjects un­doubtedly require such an arrangement of words as runs much on long syllables; and, particularly, they require the close to rest upon such. The very first verses of the Bi­ble, are remarkable for this melody: In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth; and the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God moved on the face of the waters. Several other passages, particularly some of the Psalms, afford striking examples of this sort of grave, melodious construction. Any composition that rises considerably above the ordinary tone of prose, such as monumental inscripti­ons, and panegyrical characters, naturally runs into numbers of this kind.

BUT, in the next place, besides the gene­ral correspondence of the current of sound with the current of thought, there may be a more particular expression attempted, of certain objects, by means of resembling sounds. This can be, sometimes, accom­plished in prose composition; but there only in a more faint degree; nor is it so much ex­pected there. In poetry, chiefly, it is look for; where attention to sound is more demanded, and where the inversions and li­berties of poetical style give us a greater  command of sound; assisted, too, by the ver­sification, and that cantus obscurior, to which we are naturally led in reading poetry. This requires a little more illustration.

THE sounds of words may be employed for representing, chiefly, three classes of ob­jects; first, other sounds; secondly, motion; and, thirdly, the emotions and passions of the mind.

FIRST, I say, by a proper choice of words, we may produce a resemblance of other sounds which we mean to describe, such as, the noise of waters, the roaring of winds, or the murmuring of streams. This is the simplest instance of this sort of beauty. For the medium through which we imitate, here, is a natural one; sounds represented by other sounds; and between ideas of the same sense, it is easy to form a connection. No very great art is required in a poet, when he is describing sweet and soft sounds, to make use of such words as have most liquids and vowels, and glide the softest; or, when he is describing harsh sounds, to throw together a number of harsh syllables which are of difficult pronunciation. Here the common structure of Language assists him; for, it will be found, that, in most Languages, the names of many particular sounds are so form  as to carry some affinity to the sound which they signify; as with us, the whistling of winds, the buz and hum of insects, the  hiss of serpents, the crash of falling timber; and many other instances, where the word has been plainly framed upon the sound it represents. I shall produce a remarkable example of this beauty from Milton, taken from two passages in Paradise Lost, describ the sound made, in the one, by the open of the gates of Hell; in the other, by the opening of those of Heaven. The contrast between the two, displays, to great advan­tage, the poet art. The first is the open of Hell gates:
 ”On a sudden, open fly,
With impetuous recoil, and jarring sound,  infernal doors; and on their hinges grate
Harsh thunder. ”  I.

Observe, now, the smoothness of the other:
 ”Heaven opened wide
Her ever-during gates, harmonious [...]ound,
On golden hinges turning. ”  

The following beautiful passage from Tasso Gierusalemme, has been often admired, on account of the imitation effected by sound of the thing represented:
Chiama gli habitator ombre eterne
Il rauco suon Tartarea tromba:
Treman le spaciose atre caverne,
Et aer cieco a quel rumor rimbomba;
Ni stridendo cosi superne.
Regioni dele cielo, il folgor piomba;
 Ne si scossa giammai terra,
Quand i vapori in sen gravida serra.
CANT.  Stanz. 4.

THE second class of objects, which the sound of words is often employed to imitate, is, Motion; as it is swift or slow, violent or gentle, equable or interrupted, easy or ac­companied with effort. Though there be no natural affinity between sound, of any kind, and motion, yet, in the imagination, there is a strong one; as appears from the connection between music and dancing. And, there­fore, here it is in the poet power to give us a lively idea of the kind of motion he would describe, by means of sounds which correspond, in our imagination, with that motion. Long syllables naturally give the impression of slow motion; as in this line of Virgil:
Olli inter sese magna brachia tollunt.

A succession of short syllables presents quick motion to the mind; as,
Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.

BOTH Homer and Virgil are great masters of this beauty; and their works abound with instances of it; most of them, indeed, so often quoted, and so well known, that it is needless to produce them. I shall give one instance, in English, which seems happy. It  is the description of a sudden calm on the seas, in a Poem, entitled, The Fleece.
 ”With easy course
The vessels glide; unless their speed be stopped
By dead calms, that often lie on these smooth seas
When ev'ry zephyr sleeps; then the shrouds drop;
The downy feather, on the cordage hung,
Moves not; the flat sea shines like yellow gold
Fused in the fire, or like the marble floor
Of some old temple wide. ”

THE third set of objects, which I menti­oned the sound of words as capable of re­presenting, consists of the passions and emo­tions of the mind. Sound may, at first view, appear foreign to these; but, that here, also, there is some sort of connection, is sufficient­ly proved by the power which music has to awaken, or to assist certain passions, and, according as its strain is varied, to introduce one train of ideas, rather than another. This, indeed, logically speaking, cannot be called a resemblance between the sense and the sound, seeing long or short syllables have no natural resemblance to any thought or pas­sion. But if the arrangement of syllables, by their sound alone, recal one set of ideas more readily than another, and dispose the mind for entering into that affection which the poet means to raise, such arrangement may, justly enough, be said to resemble the sense, or be similar and correspondent to it. I admit, that, in many instances, which are supposed to display this beauty of accommo­dation  of sound to the sense, there is much room for imagination to work; and, accord as a reader is struck by a passage, he will often fancy a resemblance between the sound and the sense, which others cannot discover. He modulates the numbers to his own dispo­sition of mind; and, in effect, makes the music which he imagines himself to hear. However, that there are real instances of this kind, and that poetry is capable of some such expression, cannot be doubted. Dryden Ode on St. Cecilia Day, affords a very beau­tiful exemplification of it, in the English Lan­guage. Without much study or reflection, a poet describing pleasure, joy, and agreeable objects, from the feeling of his subject, na­turally runs into smooth, liquid, and flow numbers.
 ”Namque ipsa decoram
Caesariem nato genetrix, lumenque juventae
Purpureum, et laetos oculis afflarat honores.
AEN. I.

Or,
DevenÃªre locos laetos & amaena vireta,
Fortunatorum nemorum, sedesque beatas;
Largior hic campos aether, & lumine vestit
Purpureo, solemque suum, sua sidera norant.
AEN. 

Brisk and lively sensations, exact quicker and more animated numbers.
 ”Juvenum manus emicat ardens
Littus in Hesperium.
AEN. 

 Melancholy and gloomy subjects, naturally express themselves in slow measures, and long words:
In those deep solitudes and awful cells,
Where heavenly pensive contemplation dwells.

Et caligantem nigrÃ¢ formidine lucum.

I HAVE now given sufficient openings into this subject: a moderate acquaintance with the good poets, either ancient or modern, will suggest many instances of the same kind. And with this, I finish the discussion of the Structure of Sentences; having fully consi­dered them under all the heads I mentioned; of Perspicuity, Unity, Strength, and Musi­cal Arrangement.

LECTURE XIV. ORIGIN AND NATURE OF FIGURA­TIVE LANGUAGE.

HAVING now finished what related to the construction of sentences, I proceed to other rules concerning Style. My gene­ral division of the qualities of Style, was in­to Perspicuity and Ornament. Perspicuity, both in single words and in sentences, I have considered. Ornament, as far as it arises from a graceful, strong, or melodious con­struction of words, has also been treated of. Another, and a great branch of the orna­ment of Style, is, Figurative Language; which is now to be the subject of our consi­deration, and will require a full discussion.

Our first enquiry must be, What is meant by Figures of Speech*?

 IN general, they always imply some depar­ture from simplicity of expression; the idea which we intend to convey, not only enun­ciated to others, but enunciated, in a parti­cular manner, and with some circumstance, added, which is designed to render the im­pression more strong and vivid. When I say, for instance, That a good man enjoys com­fort in the midst of adversity; I just ex­press my thought in the simplest manner pos­sible. But when I say, To the upright there ariseth light in darkness; the same sentiment is expressed in a figurative Style; a new circumstance is introduced; light is put in the place of comfort, and darkness is used to suggest the idea of adversity. In the same manner, to say, It is impossible, by any search we can make, to explore the divine nature fully, is, to make a simple proposition. But when we say, Canst thou, by searching, find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection? It is high as Heaven, what canst thou do? deeper than Hell, what canst thou know? This introduces a figure into Style; the pro­position being not only expressed, but admi­ration  and astonishment being expressed to­gether with it.

BUT, though Figures imply a deviation from what may be reckoned the most simple form of Speech, we are not thence to con­clude, that they imply any thing uncommon, or unnatural. This is so far from being the case, that, on very many occasions, they are both the most natural, and the most common method of uttering our sentiments. It is impossible to compose any discourse without using them often; nay, there are few Sen­tences of any length, in which some expres­sion or other, that may be termed a Figure, does not occur. From what causes this hap­pens, shall be afterwards explained. The fact, in the mean time, shows, that they are to be accounted part of that Language which nature dictates to men. They are not the invention of the schools, nor the mere pro­duct of study: on the contrary, the most il­literate speak in figures, as often as the most learned. Whenever the imaginations of the vulgar are much awakened, or their passions inflamed against one another, they will pour forth a torrent of Figurative Language, as forcible as could be employed by the most artifical declaimer.

WHAT then is it, which has drawn the attention of critics and rhetoricians so much to these forms of Speech? It is this: They remarked, that in them consists much of the  beauty and the force of Language; and found them always to bear some characters, or distinguishing marks, by the help of which they could reduce them under separate classes and heads. To this, perhaps, they owe their name of Figures. As the figure, or shape of one body, distinguishes it from another, so these forms of Speech have, each of them, a cast or turn peculiar to itself, which both distinguishes it from the rest, and distinguishes it from Simple Expression. Simple Expression just makes our idea known to others; but Figurative Language, over and above, be­stows a particular dress upon that idea; a dress, which both makes it be remarked, and adorns it. Hence, this sort of Language be­came early a capital object of attention to those who studied the powers of Speech.

FIGURES, in general, may be described to be that Language, which is prompted either by the imagination, or by the passions. The justness of this description will appear, from the more particular account I am afterwards to give of them. Rhetoricians commonly divide them into two great classes; Figures of Words, and Figures of Thought. The former, Figures of Words, are commonly called Tropes, and consist in a word being employed to signify something that is differ­ent from its original and primitive meaning; so that if you alter the word, you destroy the Figure. Thus, in the instance I gave before; Light ariseth to the upright, in darkness.  The Trope consists, in light and darkness being not meant literally, but substituted for comfort and adversity, on account of some resemblance or analogy, which they are sup­posed to bear to these conditions of life. The other class, termed Figures of Thought, sup­poses the words to be used in their proper and literal meaning, and the figure to consist in the turn of the thought; as is the case in exclamations, interrogations, apostrophes, and comparisons; where, though you vary the words that are used, or translate them from one Language into another, you may, never­theless, still preserve the same Figure in the thought. This distinction, however, is of no great use; as nothing can be built upon it in practice; neither is it always very clear. It is of little importance, whether we give to some particular mode of expression the name of a Trope, or of a Figure; provided we remember, that Figurative Language always imports some colouring of the imagination, or some emotion of passion, expressed in our Style: And, perhaps, figures of imagination, and figures of passion, might be a more use­ful distribution of the subject. But without insisting on any artificial divisions, it will be more useful, that I enquire into the Origin and the Nature of Figures. Only, before proceeding to this, there are two general observations which it may be proper to pre­mise.

 THE first is, concerning the use of rules with respect to Figurative Language. I mit, that persons may both speak and write with propriety, who know not the names of any of the Figures of Speech, nor ever stu­died any rules relating to them. Nature, as was before observed, dictates the use of Fi­gures; and, like Mons. Jourdain, in Moliere, who had spoken for forty years in prose, without ever knowing it, many a one uses metaphorical expressions to good purpose, without any idea of what a metaphor is. It will not, however, follow thence, that rules are of no service. All science arises from observations on practice. Practice has al­ways gone before method and rule; but me­thod and rule have afterwards improved and perfected practice, in every art. We, every day, meet with persons who sing agreeably, without knowing one note of the gamut. Yet, it has been found of importance to re­duce these notes to a scale, and to form an art of music; and it would be ridiculous to pretend, that the art is of no advantage, be­cause the practice is founded in nature. Propriety and beauty of Speech, are certain­ly as improveable as the ear or the voice; and to know the principles of this beauty, or the reasons which render one Figure, or one manner of Speech preferable to another, can­not fail to assist and direct a proper choice.

BUT I must observe, in the next place, that, although this part of style merit atten   and be a very proper object of science and rule; although much of the beauty of composition depends on figurative language; yet we must beware of imagining that it pends solely, or even chiefly, upon such lan­guage. It is not so. The great place which the doctrine of tropes and figures has occu­pied in systems of rhetoric; the over-anxi­ous care which has been shewn in giving names to a vast variety of them, and in ranging them under different classes, has often led persons to imagine, that, if their compo­sition was well bespangled with a number of these ornaments of speech, it wanted no other beauty; whence has arisen much stiff­ness and affectation. For it is, in truth, the sentiment or passion, which lies under the figured expression, that gives it any merit. The figure is only the dress; the sentiment is the body and the substance. No figures will render a cold or an empty composition interesting; whereas, if a sentiment be su­blime or pathetic, it can support itself per­fectly well, without any borrowed assistance. Hence several of the most affecting and mired passages of the best authors, are ex­pressed in the simplest language. The fol­lowing sentiment from Virgil, for instance, makes its way at once to the heart, without the help of any figure whatever. He is scribing an Argive, who falls in battle, in Italy, at a great distance from his native country:

Sternitur, infelix, alieno vulnere, coelumque
Aspicit, et dulces moriens reminiscitur Argos*.
Aen.  781.

A single stroke of this kind, drawn as by the very pencil of Nature, is worth a thousand figures. In the same manner, the simple style of Scripture: He spoke, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. ” God said, let there be light; and there was light, imports a lofty conception to  much greater advantage, than if it had been decorated by the most pompous metaphors. The fact is, that the strong pathetic, and the pure sublime, not only have little dependance on figures of speech, but, generally, reject them. The proper region of these orna­ments is, where a moderate degree of eleva and passion is predominant; and there they contribute to the embellishment of dis­course, only, when there is a basis of solid thought and natural sentiment; when they are inserted in their proper place; and when they rise, of themselves, from the subject, without being sought after.

HAVING premised these observations, I proceed to give an account of the origin and nature of Figures; principally of such as have their dependance on language; including that numerous tribe, which the rhetoricians call Tropes.

AT the first rise of language, men would begin with giving names to the different ob­jects which they discerned, or thought of. This nomenclature would, at the beginning, be very narrow. According as men ideas multiplied, and their acquaintance with ob­jects increased, their stock of names and words would increase also. But to the infinite variety of objects and ideas, no language is adequate. No language is so copious, as to have a separate word for every separate idea. Men naturally sought to abridge this labour of multiplying  words in infinitum; and, in order to lay less bur­den on their memories, made one word, which they had already appropriated to a certain idea or object, stand also for some other idea or object; between which and the primary one, they found, or fancied, some relation. Thus, the preposition, in, was originally in­vented to express the circumstance of place: The man was killed in the wood. In pro­gress of time, words were wanted to express men being connected with certain conditi­ons of fortune, or certain situations of mind; and some resemblance, or analogy, being fancied between these, and the place of bo­dies, the word, in, was employed to express men being so circumstanced; as, one be in health, or in sickness, in prosperity or in adversity, in joy or in grief, in doubt, or in danger, or in safety. Here we see this preposition, in, plainly assuming a tropical signification, or carried off from its original meaning, to signify something else, which relates to, or resembles it.

TROPES of this kind abound in all lan­guages, and are plainly owing to the want of proper words. The operations of the mind and affections, in particular, are, in most languages, described by words taken from sensible objects. The reason is plain. The names of sensible objects, were, in all lan­guages, the words most early introduced; and were, by degrees, extended to those mental objects, of which men had more ob­scure  conceptions, and to which they found it more difficult to assign distinct names. They borrowed, therefore, the name of some sensible idea, where their imagination found some affinity. Thus, we speak of, a piercing judgment, and a clear head; a soft or a hard heart; a rough or a smooth behaviour. We say, inflamed by anger, warmed by love, swell with pride, melted into grief; and these are almost the only significant words which we have for such ideas.

BUT, although the barrenness of language, and the want of words, be doubtless one cause of the invention of tropes; yet it is not the only, nor, perhaps, even the princi­pal source of this form of speech. Tropes have arisen more frequently, and spread them­selves wider, from the influence which Ima­gination possesses over all language. The train on which this has proceeded among all nations, I shall endeavour to explain.

EVERY object which makes any impression on the human mind, is constantly accompani with certain circumstances and relations, that strike us at the same time. It never presents itself to our view, isolÃ©, as the French express it; that is, independent on, and se­parated from, every other thing; but always occurs as somehow related to other objects; going before them, or following after them; their effect or their cause; resembling them, or opposed to them; distinguished by certain  qualities, or surrounded with certain circum­stances. By this means, every idea or ob­ject carries in its train some other ideas, which may be considered as its accessories. These accessories often strike the imagination more than the principal idea itself. They are, perhaps, more agreeable ideas; or they are more familiar to our conceptions; or they recal to our memory a greater variety of im­portant circumstances. The imagination is more disposed to rest upon some of them; and therefore, instead of using the proper name of the principal idea which it means to express, it employs, in its place, the name of the accessory or correspondent idea; al­though the principal have a proper and well­known name of its own. Hence a vast va­riety of tropical or figurative words obtain currency in all languages, through choice, not necessity; and men of lively imagina­tions are every day adding to their number.

THUS, when we design to intimate the pe­riod, at which a state enjoyed most reputation [...] glory, it were easy to employ the proper words for expressing this; but as this readily connects, in our imagination, with the flou­rishing period of a plant or a tree, we lay hold of this correspondent idea, and say, The Roman empire flourished most under Au­gustus. The leader of a faction, is plain language; but, because the head is the prin­cipal part of the human body, and is sup­posed to direct all the animal operations, rest  upon this resemblance, we say, Cati­line was the head of the party. The word, Voice, was originally invented to sig­nify the articulate sound, formed by the or­gans of the mouth; but, as by means of it men signify their ideas and their intentions to each other, Voice soon assumed a great ma­ny other meanings, all derived from this pri­mary effect. To give our Voice for any thing, signified, to give our sentiment in fa­vour of it. Not only so; but Voice was trans­ferred to signify any intimation of will or judgment, though given without the least in­terposition of Voice in its literal sense, or any sound uttered at all. Thus we speak of lis­tening to the Voice of Conscience, the Voice of Nature, the Voice of God. This usage takes place, not so much from barrenness of language, or want of a proper word, as from an allusion which we choose to make to Voice, in its primary sense, in order to convey our idea, connected with a circumstance which appears to the fancy to give it more spright­liness and force.

THE account which I have now given, and which seems to be a full and fair one, of the introduction of Tropes into all Languages, coincides with what Cicero shortly hints, in his third book Oratore. Modus trans­ferendi verba latÃ¨ patet; quam necessitas primum genuit, coacta inopia et angustias; post autem delectatio, jucunditasque cele­bravit. Nam ut vestis, frigoris depellendi  causÃ¢ reperta primo, post adhiberi caepta est ornatum etiam corporis et dignita­tem, sic verbi translatio instituta est ino­piae causÃ¢, frequentata, delectationis*.

FROM what has been said, it clearly ap­pears, how that must come to pass, which I had occasion to mention in a former Lecture, that all Languages are most figurative in their early state. Both the causes to which I ascrib the origin of Figures, concur in produc this effect at the beginnings of society. Language is then most barren; the stock of proper names, which have been invented for things, is small; and, at the same time, ima­gination exerts great influence over the con­ceptions of men, and their method of utter them; so that, both from necessity and from choice, their Speech will, at that period, abound in Tropes. For the savage tribes of men are always much given to wonder and astonishment. Every new object surprises, terrifies, and makes a strong impression on their mind; they are governed by imagina and passion, more than by reason; and, of course, their speech must be deeply tinc­tured by their genius. In fact, we find, that  this is the character of the American and In­dian Languages; bold, picturesque, and me­taphorical; full of strong allusions to sensible qualities, and to such objects as struck them most in their wild and solitary life. An In­dian chief makes a harangue to his tribe, in a style full of stronger metaphors than a Eu­ropean would use in an epic poem.

AS Language makes gradual progress to­wards refinement, almost every object comes to have a proper name given to it, and Per­spicuity and Precision are more studied. But still, for the reasons before given, borrowed words, or as rhetoricians call them, Tropes, must continue to occupy a considerable place. In every Language, too, there are a multi­tude of words, which, though they were Figurative in their first application to certain objects, yet, by long use, lose that figurative power wholly, and come to be considered as simple and literal expressions. In this case, are the terms which I remarked before, as transferred from sensible qualities to the ope­rations or qualities of the mind, a piercing judgment, a clear head, a hard heart, and the like. There are other words which re­main in a sort of middle state; which have neither lost wholly their figurative applicati­on, nor yet retain so much of it, as to im­print any remarkable character of figured Lauguage on our style; such as these phrases, apprehend one meaning; enter on a subject; follow out an argument;  stir up strife; and a great many more, of which our Language is full. In the use of such phrases, correct writers will always pre­serve a regard to the figure or allusion on which they are founded, and will be careful not to apply them in any way that is incon­sistent with it. One may be sheltered un­der the patronage of a great man; but it were wrong to say, sheltered under the masque of dissimulation, as a masque conceals, but does not shelter. An object, in description, may be clothed, if you will, with epithets; but it is not so pro­per to speak of its being clothed with cir­cumstances; as the word circumstances, alludes to standing round, not to clothing. Such attentions as these are requisite in the common run of Style.

WHAT has been said on this subject, tends to throw light on the nature of Language in general; and will lead to the reasons, Why Tropes or Figures contribute to the beauty and grace of Style.

FIRST, They enrich Language, and ren­der it more copious. By their means, words and phrases are multiplied for expressing all sorts of ideas; for describing even the minutest differences; the nicest shades and colours of thought; which no Language could possibly do by proper words alone, without assistance from Tropes.

 SECONDLY, They bestow dignity upon Style. The familiarity of common words, to which our ears are much accustomed, tends to degrade Style. When we want to adapt our Language to the tone of an elevated sub­ject, we would be greatly at a loss, if we could not borrow assistance from Figures; which, properly employed, have a similar effect on Language, with what is produced by the rich and splendid dress of a person of rank; to create respect, and to give an air of mag­nificence to him who wears it. Assistance of this kind, is often needed in prose compositi­ons; but poetry could not subsist without it. Hence Figures form the constant Language of poetry. To say, that the sun rises, is trite and common; but it becomes a magni­ficent image when expressed, as Mr. Thom­son has done:
But yonder comes the powerful king of day
Rejoicing in the east. ”

To say, that all men are subject alike to death, presents only a vulgar idea; but it rises and fills the imagination, when paint thus by Horace:
Pallida mors aequo pulsat pede, pauperum tabernas Regumque turres.

Or,
Omnes eodem cogimur; omnium,
Versatur urna, serius, ocyus,
 Sors exitura, & nos in eternum
Exilium impositura cymbae*.

IN the third place, Figures give us the pleasure of enjoying two objects presented together to our view, without confusion; the principal idea, which is the subject of the discourse, along with its accessory, which gives it the figurative dress. We see one thing in another, as Aristotle expresses it; which is always agreeable to the mind. For there is nothing with which the fancy is more delighted, than with comparisons, and re­semblances of objects; and all Tropes are founded upon some relation or analogy be­tween one thing and another. When, for instance, in place of youth, I say, the morning of life; the fancy is immediately entertained with all the resembling circum­stances which presently occur between these two objects. At one moment, I have in my eye a certain period of human life, and a certain time of the day, so related to each other, that the imagination plays between them with pleasure, and contemplates two similar objects, in one view, without em­barrassment or confusion. Not only so, but,

 IN the fourth place, Figures are attended with this farther advantage, of giving us fre­quently a much clearer and more striking view of the principal object, than we could have if it were expressed in simple terms, and divested of its accessory idea. This is, in­deed, their principal advantage, in virtue of which, they are very properly said to illus­trate a subject, or to throw light upon it. For they exhibit the object, on which they are employed, in a picturesque form; they can render an abstract conception, in some degree, an object of sense; they surround it with such circumstances, as enable the mind to lay hold of it steadily, and to contemplate it fully. Those persons, says one, who gain the hearts of most people, who are chosen as the companions of their softer hours, and their reliefs from anxiety and care, are seldom persons of shining quali­ties, or strong virtues: it is rather the soft green of the soul, on which we rest our eyes, that are fatigued with beholding more glaring objects. Here, by a happy allusi­on to a colour, the whole conception is con­veyed clear and strong to the mind in one word. By a well chosen Figure, even convic is assisted, and the impression of a truth upon the mind, made more lively and forci­ble than it would otherwise be. As in the following illustration of Dr. Young  When we dip too deep in pleasure, we always stir a sediment that renders it impure and noxi­ous; or in this, A heart boiling with  violent passions, will always send up infa­tuating fumes to the head. An image that presents so much congruity between a moral and a sensible idea, serves like an argument from analogy, to enforce what the author asserts, and to induce belief.

BESIDES, whether we are endeavouring to raise sentiments of pleasure or aversion, we can always heighten the emotion by the figures which we introduce; leading the ima­gination to a train, either of agreeable or dis­agreeable, of exalting or debasing ideas, cor­respondent to the impression which we seek to make. When we want to render an ob­ject beautiful, or magnificent, we borrow images from all the most beautiful or splen­did scenes of nature; we thereby, naturally, throw a lustre over our object; we enliven the reader mind; and dispose him to go along with us, in the gay and pleasing im­pressions which we give him of the subject. This effect of Figures is happily touched in the following lines of Dr. Akenside, and il­lustrated by a very sublime figure:
 ”Then the inexpressive strain,
Diffuses its enchantment. Fancy dreams
Of sacred fountains and Elysian groves,
And vales of bliss. The intellectual power
Bends from his awful throne a wond'ring ear,
And smiles. ”
Pleas. of Imaginat. I. 124.

 WHAT I have now explained, concerning the use and effects of Figures, naturally leads us to reflect on the wonderful power of Lan­guage; and, indeed, we cannot reflect on it without the highest admiration. What a fine vehicle is it now become for all the con­ceptions of the human mind; even for the most subtile and delicate workings of the imagination! What a pliant and flexible in­strument in the hand of one who can em­ploy it skilfully; prepared to take every form which he chuses to give it! Not content with a simple communication of ideas and thoughts, it paints those ideas to the eye; it gives co­louring and relievo, even to the most ab­stract conceptions. In the figures which it uses, it sets mirrors before us, where we may behold objects, a second time, in their like­ness. It entertains us, as with a succession of the most splendid pictures; disposes, in the most artificial manner, of the light and shade, for viewing every thing to the best advantage; in fine, from being a rude and imperfect interpreter of men wants and ne­cessities, it has now passed into an instrument of the most delicate and refined luxury.

To make these effects of Figurative Lan­guage sensible, there are few authors in the English Language, whom I can refer to with more advantage than Mr. Addison, whose imagination is, at once, remarkably rich, and remarkably correct and chaste. When he is treating, for instance, of the effect which  light and colours have to entertain the fancy, considered in Mr. Locke view of them as secondary qualities, which have no real exist­ence in matter, but are only ideas in the mind, with what beautiful painting has he adorned this philosophic speculation? Things, says he, would make but a poor appearance to the eye, if we saw them only in their proper figures and mo­tions. Now, we are every where enter­tained with pleasing shows and apparitions; we discover imaginary glories in the hea­vens, and in the earth, and see some of this visionary beauty poured out upon the whole creation. But what a rough un­sightly sketch of nature should we be en­tertained with, did all her colouring disap­pear, and the several distinctions of light and shade vanish? In short, our souls are, at present, delightfully lost, and bewilder in a pleasing delusion; and we walk about, like the enchanted hero of a ro­mance, who sees beautiful castles, woods, and meadows; and, at the same time, hears the warbling of birds, and the purling of streams; but, upon the finishing of some secret spell, the fantastic scene breaks up, and the disconsolate knight finds himself on a barren heath, or in a solitary desert. It is not improbable, that something like this may be the state of the soul after its first separation, in respect of the images it will receive from matter. No. 413. Spec.

 HAVING thus explained, at sufficient length, the Origin, the Nature, and the Effects of Tropes, I should proceed next to the several kinds and divisions of them. But, in treat of these, were I to follow the common tract of the scholastic writers on Rhetoric, I should soon become tedious, and, I appre­hend, useless, at the same time. Their great business has been, with a most patient and frivolous industry, to branch them out under a vast number of divisions, according to all the several modes in which a word may be carried from its literal meaning, into one that is Figurative, without doing any more; as if the mere knowledge of the names and classes of all the Tropes that can be formed, could be of any advantage towards the proper, or graceful use of Language. All that I pur­pose is, to give, in a few words, before finish this Lecture, a general view of the seve­ral sources whence the tropical meaning of words is derived: after which I shall, in sub­sequent Lectures, descend to a more particu­lar consideration of some of the most consi­derable Figures of Speech, and such as are in most frequent use; by treating of which, I shall give all the instruction I can, concern the proper employment of Figurative Language, and point out the errors and abuses which are apt to be committed in this part of style.

ALL Tropes, as I before observed, are founded on the relation which one object  bears to another; in virtue of which, the name of the one can be substituted instead of the name of the other; and by such a substitution, the vivacity of the idea is com­monly meant to be increased. These relati­ons, some more, some less intimate, may all give rise to Tropes. One of the first and most obvious relations is, that between a cause and its effect. Hence, in Figurative Language, the cause is, sometimes, put for the effect. Thus, Mr. Addison, writing of Italy:
Blossoms, and fruits, and flowers, together rise,
And the whole year in gay confusion lies.

Where the whole year is plainly intended, to signify the effects or productions of all the seasons of the year. At other times, again, the effect is put for the cause; as, grey hairs frequently for old age, which causes grey hairs; and shade, for trees that produce the shade. The relation between the container and the thing contained, is also so intimate and obvious, as naturally to give rise to Tropes:
 ”Ille impiger hausit
Spumantem pateram & pleno se proluit auro.

Where every one sees, that the cup and the gold are put for the liquor that was contained in the golden cup. In the same manner, the name of any country, is often used to note  the inhabitants of that country; and Heaven, very commonly employed to signi­fy God, because he is conceived as dwelling in Heaven. To implore the assistance of Heaven, is the same as to implore the assist­ance of God. The relation between any established sign and the thing signified, is a further source of Tropes. Hence,
Cedant arma togae; concedat laurea linguae.

The toga, being the badge of the civil professions, and the laurel, of military ho­nours, the badge of each is put for the civil and military characters themselves. To as­sume the sceptre, is a common phrase for entering on royal authority. To Tropes, founded on these several relations, of cause and effect, container and contained, sign and thing signified, is given the name of Metonymy.

WHEN the Trope is founded on the rela between an antecedent and a consequent, or what goes before, and immediately follows after, it is then called a Metalepsis; as in the Roman phrase of Fuit, or Vixit, to express that one was dead. Fuit Ilium et ingens gloria Dardanidum, signifies, that the glory of Troy is now no more.

WHEN the whole is put for a part, or a part for the whole; a genus for a species, or a species for a genus; the singular for the  plural, or the plural for the singular num­ber; in general, when any thing less, or any thing more, is put for the precise object meant; the figure is then called a Synec­doche. It is very common, for instance, to describe a whole object by some remarkable part of it; as when we say, A fleet of so many sail, in the place of ships; when we use the head for the person, the pole for the earth, the waves for the sea. In like manner, an attribute may be put for a subject; as, Youth and Beauty, for the young and beautiful; and some­times a subject for the attribute. But it is needless to insist longer on this enumeration, which serves little purpose. I have said enough, to give an opening into that great variety of relations between objects, by means of which, the mind is assisted to pass easily from one to another; and, by the name of the one, understands the other to be meant. It is always some accessory idea, which recals the principal to the imagina  and commonly recals it with more force, than if the principal idea had been expressed.

THE relation which, of all others, is by far the most fruitful of Tropes, I have not yet mentioned; that is, the relation of Similitude and Resemblance. On this is founded what is called the Metaphor: when, in place of using the proper name of any object, we em­ploy, in its place, the name of some other  which is like it; which is a sort of picture of it, and which thereby awakens the concep of it with more force or grace. This figure is more frequent than all the rest put toge­ther; and the language, both of prose and verse, owes to it much of its elegance and grace. This, therefore, deserves very full and particular consideration; and shall be the subject of the next Lecture.

LECTURE  METAPHOR.

AFTER the preliminary observations I have made, relating to Figurative Lan­guage in general, I come now to treat sepa­rately of such Figures of Speech, as occur most frequently, and require particular at­tention: and I begin with Metaphor. This is a figure founded entirely on the resemblance which one object bears to another. Hence, it is much allied to Simile, or Comparison; and is indeed no other than a comparison, expressed in an abridged form. When I say of some great minister, that he upholds the state, like a pillar which supports the weight of a whole edifice, I fairly make a com­parison; but when I say of such a minister, that he is the Pillar of the state, it is now beeome a Metaphor. The comparison be­twixt the Minister and a Pillar, is made in the mind; but is expressed without any of the words that denote comparison. The  comparison is only insinuated, not expressed: the one object is supposed to be so like the other, that, without formally drawing the comparison, the name of the one may be put in the place of the name of the other. The minister is the Pillar of the state. This, therefore, is a more lively and ani­mated manner of expressing the resemblances which imagination traces among objects. There is nothing which delights the fancy more, than this act of comparing things to­gether, discovering resemblances between them, and describing them by their likeness. The mind thus employed, is exercised with­out being fatigued; and is gratified with the consciousness of its own ingenuity. We need not be surprised, therefore, at finding all Language tinctured strongly with Meta­phor. It insinuates itself even into familiar conversation; and, unsought, rises up of its own accord in the mind. The very words which I have casually employed in describing this, are a proof of what I say; tinctured, insinuates, rises up, are all of them metapho­rical expressions, borrowed from some re­semblance which fancy forms between sen­sible objects, and the internal operations of the mind; and yet the terms are no less clear, and, perhaps, more expressive, than if words had been used, which were to be taken in the strict and literal sense.

THOUGH all Metaphor imports compari­son, and, therefore, is, in that respect, a  figure of thought; yet, as the words in a Metaphor are not taken literally, but chang from their proper to a Figurative sense, the Metaphor is commonly ranked among Tropes or Figures of words. But, provided the nature of it be well understood, it signi­fies very little whether we call it a Figure or a Trope. I have confined it to the expression of resemblance between two objects. I must remark, however, that the word Metaphor is sometimes used in a looser and more extend sense; for the application of a term in any figurative signification, whether the figure be founded on resemblance, or on some other relation, which two objects bear to one ano­ther. For instance; when grey hairs are put for old age, as, to bring one grey hairs with sorrow to the grave; some writers would call this a Metaphor, though it is not properly one, but what rhetoricians call a Metonymy; that is, the effect put for the cause; grey hairs being the effect of old age, but not bearing any sort of resemblance to it. Aristotle, in his Poetics, uses Meta­phor in this extended sense, for any figura­tive meaning imposed upon a word; as a whole put for the part, or a part for the whole; a species for the genus, or a genus for the species. But it would be unjust to tax this most acute writer with any inaccu­racy on this account; the minute subdivisi­ons, and various names of Tropes, being un­known in his days, and the invention of later rhetoricians. Now, however, when these  divisions are established, it is inaccurate to call every figurative use of terms, promis­cuously, a Metaphor.

OF all the figures of Speech, none comes so near to painting as Metaphor. Its pecu­liar effect is to give light and strength to scription; to make intellectual ideas, in some sort, visible to the eye, by giving them co­lour, and substance, and sensible qualities. In order to produce this effect, however, a delicate hand is required; for, by a very lit­tle inaccuracy, we are in hazard of intro­ducing confusion, in place of promoting Per­spicuity. Several rules, therefore, are neces­sary to be given for the proper management of Metaphors. But, before entering on these, I shall give one instance of a very beautiful Metaphor, that I may show the figure to full advantage. I shall take my instance from Lord Bolingbroke Remarks on the History of England. Just at the conclusion of his work, he is speaking of the behaviour of Charles I. to his last parliament: In a word, says he, about a month after their meeting, he dissolved them; he repented; but he re­pented too late of his rashness. Well might he repent; for the vessel was now full, and this last drop made the waters of bitterness overflow. Here, he adds, we draw the curtain, and put an end to our remarks. Nothing could be more happily thrown off. The Metaphor, we see,  is continued through several expressions. The vessel is put for the state, or temper of the nation already full, that is, provoked to the highest by former oppressions and wrongs; this last drop, stands for the provocation re­cently received by the abrupt dissolution of the parliament; and the overflowing of the waters of bitterness, beautifully expresses all the effects of resentment let loose by an ex­asperated people.

ON this passage, we may make two remarks in passing. The one, that nothing forms a more spirited and dignified conclusion of a subject, than a figure of this kind happily placed at the close. We see the effect of it, in this instance. The author goes off with a good grace; and leaves a strong and full impression of his subject on the reader mind. My other remark is, the advantage which a Metaphor frequently has above a formal comparison. How much would the sentiment here have been enfeebled, if it had been expressed in the style of a regular si­mile, thus: Well might he repent; for the state of the nation, loaded with griev­ances and provocations, resembled a ves­sel that was now full, and this superadded provocation, like the last drop infused, made their rage and resentment, as wa­ters of bitterness, overflow. It has infi­nitely more spirit and force as it now stands, in the form of a Metaphor. Well might he repent; for the vessel was now full; and  this last drop made the waters of bitter­ness overflow.

HAVING mentioned, with applause, this instance from Lord Bolingbroke, I think it incumbent on me here to take notice, that, though I may have recourse to this author, sometimes, for examples of style, it is his style only, and not his sentiments, that serve praise. It is, indeed, my opinion, that there are few writings in the English Lan­guage, which, for the matter contained in them, can be read with less profit or fruit, than Lord Bolingbroke works. His politi­cal writings have the merit of a very lively and eloquent style; but they have no other; being, as to the substance, the mere tempo­rary productions of faction and party; no better, indeed, than pamphlets written for the day. His Posthumous, or, as they are called, his Philosophical Works, wherein he attacks religion, have still less merit; for they are as loose in the style as they are flimsy in the reasoning. An unhappy instance, this author is, of parts and genius so miserably perverted by faction and passion, that, as his memory will descend to posterity with little honour, so his productions will soon pass, and are, indeed, already passing into neglect and oblivion.

RETURNING from this digression to the subject before us, I proceed to lay down the rules to be observed in the conduct of Meta­phors;  and which are much the same for Tropes of every kind.

THE first which I shall mention, is, that they be suited to the nature of the subject of which we treat; neither too many, nor too gay, nor too elevated for it; that we neither attempt to force the subject, by means of them, into a degree of elevation which is not congruous to it; nor, on the other hand, al­low it to sink below its proper dignity. This is a direction which belongs to all Figurative Language, and should be ever kept in view. Some Metaphors are allowable, nay beauti­ful, in poetry, which it would be absurd and unnatural to employ in prose; some may be graceful in orations, which would be very improper in historical, or philosophical com­position. We must remember, that figures are the dress of our sentiments. As there is a natural congruity between dress, and the character or rank of the person who wears it, a violation of which congruity never fails to hurt; the same holds precisely as to the ap­plication of figures to sentiment. The ex­cessive, or unseasonable employment of them, is mere foppery in writing. It gives a boyish air to composition; and, instead of raising a subject, in fact, diminishes its dignity. For, as in life, true dignity must be founded on character, not on dress and appearance, so the dignity of composition must arise from sentiment and thought, not from ornament. The affectation and parade of ornament, tract  as much from an author, as they do from a man. Figures and Metaphors, there­fore, should, on no occasion, be stuck on too profusely; and never should, be such as re­fuse to accord with the strain of our senti­ment. Nothing can be more unnatural, than for a writer to carry on a train of reasoning, in the same sort of Figurative Language, which he would use in description. When he reasons, we look only for perspicuity; when he describes, we expect embellishment; when he divides, or relates, we desire plain­ness and simplicity. One of the greatest se­crets in composition is, to know when to be simple. This always gives a heightening to ornament, in its proper place. The right disposition of the shade, makes the light and colouring strike the more: Is enim est elo­quens, says Cicero, qui et humilia sub­tiliter, et magna graviter, et mediocria temperatÃ¨ potest dicere. ”Nam qui nihil potest tranquillÃ¨, nihil leniter, nihil defi­nitÃ¨, distinctÃ¨, potest dicere, is, cum non praeparatis auribus inflammare rem caepit, furere apud sanos, et quasi inter sobrios bacchari temulentus videtur*. This monition should be particularly attended to  by young practitioners in the art of writing, who are apt to be carried away by an undis­tinguishing admiration of what is showy and florid, whether in its place or not*.

THE second rule, which I give, respects the choice of objects, from whence Meta­phors, and other Figures, are to be drawn. The field for Figurative Language is very wide. All nature, to speak in the style of fi­gures, opens its stores to us, and admits us to gather, from all sensible objects, whatever can illustrate intellectual or moral ideas. Not only the gay and splendid objects of sense, but the grave, the terrifying, and even the gloomy and dismal, can, on different occasi­ons, be introduced into figures with proprie­ty. But we must beware of ever using such allusions as raise in the mind disagreeable, mean, vulgar, or dirty ideas. Even, when Metaphors are chosen in order to vilify and degrade any object, an author should study  never to be nauseous in his allusions, Cicero blames an orator of his time, for terming his enemy Stercus Curiae; quamvis sit si­mile, says he, tamen est deformis cogi­tatio similitudinis. But, in subjects of dignity, it is an unpardonable fault to intro­duce mean and vulgar Metaphors. In the treatise on the Art of Sinking, in Dean Swift works, there is a full and humourous collec of instances of this kind, wherein au­thors, instead of exalting, have contrived to degrade, their subjects by the figures they employed. Authors of greater note than those which are there quoted, have, at times, fallen into this error. Archbishop Tillotson, for instance, is sometimes negligent in his choice of Metaphors; as, when speaking of the day of judgment, he describes the world, as cracking about the sinners ears. Shake­speare, whose imagination was rich and bold, in a much greater degree than it was deli­cate, often fails here. The following, for ex­ample, is a gross transgression; in his Henry  having mentioned a dunghill, he present­ly raises a Metaphor from the steam of it; and on a subject too, that naturally led to much nobler ideas:
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills
They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven.
Act.  Sc. 8.

 IN the third place, as Metaphors should be drawn from objects of some dignity, so particular care should be taken that the re­semblance, which is the foundation of the Metaphor, be clear and perspicuous, not far-fetched, nor difficult to discover. The transgression of this rule makes, what are called harsh or forced Metaphors, which are always displeasing, because they puzzle the reader, and, instead of illustrating the thought, render it perplexed and intricate. With Me­taphors of this kind, Cowley abounds. He, and some of the writers of his age, seem to have considered it as the perfection of wit, to hit upon likenesses between objects which no other person could have discovered; and, at the same time, to pursue those Metaphors so far, that it requires some ingenuity to fol­low them out, and comprehend them. This makes a Metaphor resemble an aenigma; and is the very reverse of Cicero rule on this head: Verecunda debet esse translatio; ut deducta esse in alienum locum non irruisse, atque ut voluntario non venisse videa­tur*. How forced and obscure, for in­stance, are the following verses of Cowley, speaking of his mistress:
Wo to her stubborn heart, if once mine come
Into the self-same room,
 it will tear and blow up all within,
Like a Granada, shot into a magazine.
Then shall love keep the ashes and torn parts,
Of both our broken hearts;
Shall out of both one new one make;
From her  alloy, from mine the metal take;
For of her heart, he from the flames will find
But little left behind;
Mine only will remain entire,
No dross was there to perish in the fire.

In this manner he addresses sleep:
In vain, thou drowsy God, I thee invoke,
For thou who dost from fumes arise,
Thou who man soul dost overshade,
With a thick cloud by vapours made;
Canst have no power to shut his eyes,
Whose flame so pure, that it sends up no smoke.
Yet how do tears but from some vapours rise?
Tears that bewinter all my year;
The fate of Egypt I sustain,
And never feel the dew of rain,
From clouds which in the head appear:
But all my too much moisture owe
To overflowings of the heart below*.

Trite and common resemblances should in­deed be avoided in our Metaphors. To be new, and not vulgar, is a beauty. But when they are fetched from some likeness too re­mote, and lying too far out of the road of ordinary thought, then, besides their obscu­rity, they have also the disadvantage of ap­pearing  laboured, and, as the French call it, recherchÃ©: whereas Metaphor, like every other ornament, loses its whole grace, when it does not seem natural and easy.

IT is but a bad and ungraceful softening, which writers sometimes use for a harsh me­taphor, when they palliate it with the ex­pression, as it were. This is but an awkward parenthesis; and Metaphors, which need this apology of an as it were, had, generally, be better omitted. Metaphors, too, borrow from any of the sciences, especially such of them as belong to particular professions, are almost always faulty by their obscu­rity.

IN the fourth place, it must be carefully attended to, in the conduct of Metaphors, never to jumble metaphorical and plain lan­guage together; never to construct a period so, that part of it must be understood meta­phorically, part literally: which always pro­duces a most disagreeable confusion. In­stances, which are but too frequent, even in good authors, will make this rule, and the reason of it, be clearly understood. In Mr. Pope translation of the Odyssey, Penelope, bewailing the abrupt departure of her son Telemachus, is made to speak thus:
Long to my joys my dearest Lord is lost,
His country buckler, and the Grecian boast;
 Now from my fond embrace by tempests torn,
Our other column of the state is borne,
Nor took a kind adieu, nor sought consent*.  962.

Here, in one line, her son is figured as a co­lumn; and in the next, he returns to be a person, to whom it belongs to take adieu, and to ask consent. This is inconsistent. The Poet should either have kept himself to to the idea of a Man, in the literal sense; or, if he figured him by a Column, he should have ascribed nothing to him but what be­longed to it. He was not at liberty to ascribe to that Column the actions and properties of a Man. Such unnatural mixtures render the image indistinct; leaving it to waver, in our conception, between the figurative and the literal sense. Horace rule, which he applies to Characters, should be observed by all wri­ters who deal in Figures:
 ”Servetur imum,
Qualis ab incepto processerit, et sibi constet.

Mr. Pope, elsewhere, addressing himself to the King, says,

To thee the World its present homage pays,
The harvest early, but mature the praise.

This, though not so gross, is a fault, how­ever, of the same kind. It is plain, that, had not the rhyme misled him to the choice of an improper phrase, he would have said,
The Harvest early, but mature the crop:

And so would have continued the figure which he had begun. Whereas, by drop­ping it unfinished, and by employing the li­teral word, praise, when we were expecting something that related to the Harvest, the figure is broken, and the two members of the sentence have no proper correspondent with each other:
The Harvest early, but mature the Praise.

THE Works of Ossian abound with beau­tiful and correct Metaphors; such as that on a Hero: In peace, thou art the Gate of Spring; in war, the Mountain Storm. Or this, on a Woman: She was covered with the Light of Beauty; but her heart was the House of Pride. They afford, however, one instance of the fault we are now censuring: Trothal went forth with the Stream of his people, but they met a Rock: for Fingal stood unmoved; broken they rolled back from his side. Nor did they roll in safety; the spear of the King  pursued their flight. At the beginning, the Metaphor is very beautiful. The Stream, the unmoved Rock, the Waves rolling back broken, are expressions employed in the pro­per and consistent language of Figure; but, in the end, when we are told, they did not roll in safety, because the spear of the King pursued their flight, the literal mean is improperly mixed with the Meta­phor: they are, at one and the same time, presented to us as waves that roll, and men that may be pursued and wounded with a spear. If it be faulty to jumble together, in this manner, metaphorical and plain language, it is still more so,

IN the fifth place, to make two different Metaphors meet on one object. This is what is called mixed Metaphor, and is indeed one of the grossest abuses of this figure; such as Shakespeare expression, to take arms against a sea of troubles. This makes a most unnatural medley, and confounds the imagination entirely. Quinctilian has suffi­ciently guarded us against it. imprimis est custodiendum, ut quo genere coeperis translationis, hoc finias. Multi autem cÃ initium a tempestate sumserunt, incendio aut ruina finiunt; quae est inconsequentia rerum foedissima*. Observe, for instance,  what an inconsistent groupe of objects is brought together by Shakespeare, in the fol­lowing passage of the Tempest; speaking of persons recovering their judgment after the enchantment, which held them, was dissol­ved:
 ”The charm dissolves apace,
And as the morning steals upon the night
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Their clearer reason. ”

So many ill-sorted things are here joined, that the mind can see nothing clearly; the morn stealing upon the darkness, and at the same time melting it; the senses of men chasing fumes, ignorant fumes, and fumes that mantle. So again in Romeo and Juliet:
 ”as glorious,
As is a winged messenger from heaven,
Unto the white upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals, that fall back to gaze on him,
When he bestrides the lazy pacing clouds,
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

Here, the Angel is represented, as, at one moment, bestriding the clouds, and sailing upon the air; and upon the bosom of the air too; which forms such a confused picture, that it is impossible for any imagination to comprehend it.

MORE correct writers than Shakespeare, sometimes fall into this error of mixing Me­taphors.  It is surprising how the following inaccuracy should have escaped Mr. Addison, in his Letter from Italy:
I bridle in my struggling muse with pain,
That longs to launch into a bolder strain*.

The muse, figured as a horse, may be bri­dled; but when we speak of launching, we make it a ship; and, by no force of imagina  can it be supposed both a horse and a ship at one moment; bridled, to hinder it from launching. The same Author, in one of his numbers in the Spectator, says, There is not a single view of human nature, which is not sufficient to extinguish the seeds of pride. Observe the incoherence of the things here joined together, making a view extinguish, and extinguish seeds.

HORACE also, is incorrect, in the follow passage:
Urit enim fulgore suo qui pregravat artes
Infra se positas. ”

Urit qui pregravat. ”He dazzles who bears down with his weight; makes plainly an in­consistent mixture of metaphorical ideas. Neither can this other passage be altogether vindicated:

Ah! quantÃ¢ laboras in Charybdi,
Digne puer, meliore flammÃ¢!

Where a whirlpool of water, Charybdis, is said to be a flame, not good enough for this young man; meaning, that he was unfortu­nate in the object of his passion. Flame is, indeed, become almost a literal word for the passion of love; but as it still retains, in some degree, its figurative power, it should never have been used as synonymous with water, and mixed with it in the same Metaphor. When Mr. Pope (Eloisa to Abelard) says,
All then is full, possessing and possest,
No craving void left aking in the breast;

A void may, metaphorically, be said to crave; but can a void be said to ake?

A GOOD rule has been given for examin the propriety of Metaphors, when we doubt whether or not they be of the mixed kind; namely, that we should try to form a picture upon them, and consider how the parts would agree, and what sort of figure the whole would present, when delineated with a pencil. By this means, we should become sensible, whether inconsistent circum­stances were mixed, and a monstrous image thereby produced, as in all those faulty in­stances, I have now been giving; or whether the object was, all along, presented in one natural and consistent point of view.

 As Metaphors ought never to be mixed, so, in the sixth place, we should avoid crowd them together on the same object. Sup­posing each of the Metaphors to be preserv distinct, yet, if they be heaped on one another, they produce a confusion somewhat of the same kind with the mixed Metaphor. We may judge of this by the following pas­sage from Horace:
Motum ex Metello consule civicum,
Bellique causas, et vitia, et modos,
Ludumque fortunae, gravesque
Principum amicitias, & arma
Nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus,
Periculosae plenum opus aleae,
Tractas, et incedis per ignes
Suppositos cineri doloso*.  2. I.

This passage, though very poetical, is, how­ever, harsh and obscure; owing to no other cause but this, that three distinct Metaphors are crowded together, to describe the difficul­ty of Pollio writing a history of the civil  wars. First, Tractas arma uncta cruoribus nondum expiatis; next, Opus plenum periculosae aleae; and then; Incedis per ignes suppositos doloso cineri. The mind has difficulty in passing readily through so many different views given it, in quick suc­cession, of the same object.

THE only other rule concerning Metaphors which I shall add, in the seventh place, is, that they be not too far pursued. If the re­semblance, on which the figure is founded, be long dwelt upon, and carried into all its minute circumstances, we make an allegory instead of a metaphor; we tire the reader, who soon wearies of this play of fancy; and we render our discourse obscure. This is call  straining a Metaphor. Cowley deals in this to excess; and to this error is owing, in a great measure, that intricacy and harshness, in his figurative Language, which I before remarked. Lord Shaftsbury, is sometimes guilty of pursuing his Metaphors too far. Fond, to a high degree, of every decoration of style, when once he had hit upon a figure that pleased him, he was extremely loth to part with it. Thus, in his advice to an au­thor, having taken up soliloquy, or medita  under the Metaphor of a proper me­thod of evacuation for an author, he pursues this Metaphor through several pages, under all the forms of discharging crudities, throw off froth and scum, bodily operation, taking physic, curing indigestion, giving  vent to choler, bile, flatulencies, and tu­mours; till at last, the idea becomes nau­seous. Dr. Young also often trespasses in the same way. The merit, however, of this writer, in figurative Language, is great, and deserves to be remarked. No writer, anti­ent or modern, had a stronger imagination than Dr. Young, or one more fertile in figures of every kind. His Metaphors are often new, and often natural and beautiful. But, as his imagination was strong and rich, rather than delicate and correct, he sometimes gives it too loose reins. Hence, in his Night Thoughts, there prevails an obscurity, and a hardness in his style. The Metaphors are frequently too bold, and frequently too far pursued; the reader is dazzled rather than enlightened; and kept constantly on the stretch to com­prehend, and keep pace with, the author. We may observe, for instance, how the fol­lowing Metaphor is spun out:
Thy thoughts are vagabonds; all outward bound,
Midst sands and rocks, and storms, to cruise for pleasure,
If gained, dear bought; and better missed than gained.
Fancy and sense, from an infected shore,
Thy cargo brings; and pestilence the prize;
Then such the thirst, insatiable thirst,
By fond indulgence but inflamed the more,
Fancy still cruizes, when poor sense is tired.

 Speaking of old age, he says, it should
Walk thoughtful on the silent solemn shore
Of that vast ocean, it must sail so soon;
And put good works on board; and wait the wind
That shortly blows us into worlds unknown.

THE two first lines are uncommonly beau­tiful; walk thoughtful on the silent,   but when he continues the Metaphor, to putting good works on board, and waiting the wind, it plainly becomes strained, and sinks in dignity. Of all the English authors, I know none so happy in his Metaphors as Mr. Addison. His imagination was neither so rich nor so strong as Dr. Young  but far more chaste and delicate. Perspicuity, na­tural grace and ease, always distinguish his figures. They are neither harsh nor strain  they never appear to have been studied or sought after; but seem to rise of their own accord from the subject, and constantly embellish it.

I HAVE now treated fully of the Metaphor, and the rules that should govern it, a part of the doctrine of style so important, that it required particular illustration. I have only to add a few words concerning Allegory.

AN Allegory may be regarded as a conti­nued Metaphor; as it is the representation of some one thing by another that resembles it, and that is made to stand for it. Thus,  in Prior Henry and Emma, Emma in the following allegorical manner describes her constancy to Henry:
Did I but purpose to embark with thee
On the smooth surface of a summer sea,
While gentle zephyrs play with prosperous gales,
And fortune favour fills the swelling sails;
But would forsake the ship, and make the shore,
When the winds whistle, and the tempests roar?

WE may take also from the Scriptures a very fine example of an Allegory, in the 80th Psalm; where the people of Israel are repre­sented under the image of a vine, and the figure is supported throughout with great correctness and beauty; Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt, thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. Thou pre­paredst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with the shadow of it; and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. She sent out her boughs into the sea, and her branches into the river. Why hast thou broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? The boar out of the wood doth waste it; and the wild beast of the field doth devour it. Return, we be­seech thee, God of Hosts, look down from Heaven, and behold, and visit this vine! Here there is no circumstance (ex­cept perhaps one phrase at the beginning, thou hast cast out the heathen,) that does  not strictly agree to a vine, whilst, at the same time, the whole quadrates happily with the Jewish state represented by this figure. This is the first and principal requisite in the con­duct of an Allegory, that the figurative and the literal meaning be not mixed inconsist­ently together. For instance, instead of scribing the vine, as wasted by the boar from the wood, and devoured by the wild beast of the field, had the Psalmist said, it was afflict by heathens, or overcome by enemies (which is the real meaning), this would have ruined the Allegory, and produced the same confusion, of which I gave examples in Me­taphors, when the figurative and literal sense are mixed and jumbled together. Indeed, the same rules that were given for Meta­phors, may also be applied to Allegories, on account of the affinity they bear to each other. The only material difference between them, besides the one being short, and the other being prolonged, is, that a Metaphor always explains itself by the words that are connected with it in their proper and natural meaning; as when I say, Achilles was a Lion; an able Minister is the Pillar of the State. My Lion and my Pillar are sufficiently interpreted by the mention of Achilles and the Minister, which I join to them; but an Allegory is, or may be, allow to stand more disconnected with the literal meaning; the interpretation not so directly pointed out, but left to our own reflection.

 ALLEGORIES were a favourite method of delivering instructions in ancient times; for what we call Fables or Parables are no other than Allegories; where, by words and acti­ons attributed to beasts or inanimate objects, the dispositions of men are figured; and what we call the moral, is the unfigured sense or meaning of the Allegory. An Aenigma or Riddle is also a species of Allegory; one thing represented or imaged by another; but pur­posely wrapt up under so many circumstances, as to be rendered obscure. Where a riddle is not intended, it is always a fault in Alle­gory to be too dark. The meaning should be easily seen through the figure employed to shadow it. However the proper mixture of light and shade in such compositions, the exact adjustment of all the figurative circum­stances with the literal sense, so as neither to lay the meaning too bare and open, nor to cover and wrap it up too much, has ever been found an affair of great nicety; and there are few species of composition in which it is more difficult to write so as to please and command attention, than in Allegories. In some of the visions of the Spectator, we have examples of Allegories very happily executed.

LECTURE XVI. HYPERBOLE ”PERSONIFICATION ”APOSTROPHE.

THE next figure concerning which I am to treat, is called Hyperbole, or Exag­geration. It consists in magnifying an object beyond its natural bounds. It may be con­sidered sometimes as a trope, and sometimes as a figure of thought: and here indeed the distinction between these two classes begins not to be clear, nor is it of any importance that we should have recourse to metaphysi­cal subtilties, in order to keep them distinct. Whether we call it trope or figure, it is plain that it is a mode of speech which hath some foundation in nature. For in all languages, even in common conversation, hyperbolical expressions very frequently occur; as swift as the wind; as white as the snow, and the like; and our common forms of compliment are almost all of them extravagant Hyper­boles. If any thing be remarkably good or  great in its kind, we are instantly ready to add to it some exaggerating epithet; and to make it the greatest or best we ever saw. The imagination has always a tendency to gratify itself, by magnifying its present ob­ject, and carrying it to excess. More or less of this hyperbolical turn will prevail in lan­guage, according to the liveliness of imagina among the people who speak it. Hence young people deal always much in Hyper­boles. Hence the language of the Orientals was far more hyperbolical than that of the Europeans, who are of more phlegmatic, or, if you please, of more correct imagination. Hence, among all writers in early times, and in the rude periods of society, we may expect this figure to abound. Greater experience, and more cultivated society, abate the warmth of imagination, and chasten the manner of expression.

THE exaggerated expressions to which our ears are accustomed in conversation, scarcely strike us as Hyperboles. In an instant we make the proper abatement, and understand them according to their just value. But when there is something striking and unusual in the form of a hyperbolical expression, it then rises into a figure of speech which draws our attention: and here it is necessary to ob­serve, that unless the reader imagination be in such a state as disposes it to rise and swell along with the hyperbolical expression, he is always hurt and offended by it. For a sort  of disagreeable force is put upon him; he is required to strain and exert his fancy, when he feels no inclination to make any such ef­fort. Hence the Hyperbole is a figure of difficult management; and ought neither to be frequently used, nor long dwelt upon. On some occasions, it is undoubtedly pro­per; being, as was before observed, the na­tural style of a sprightly and heated imagin­ation, but when Hyperboles are unseasona­ble, or too frequent, they render a composi frigid and unaffecting. They are the resource of an author of feeble imagination; of one, describing objects which either want native dignity in themselves; or whose dig­nity he cannot show by describing them sim­ply, and in their just proportions, and is therefore obliged to rest upon tumid and ex­aggerated expressions.

HYPERBOLES are of two kinds; either such as are employed in description, or such as are suggested by the warmth of passion. The best by far, are those which are the ef­fect of passion: for if the imagination has a tendency to magnify its objects beyond their natural proportion, passion possesses this ten­dency in a vastly stronger degree; and there­fore not only excuses the most daring figures, but very often renders them natural and just. All passions, without exception, love, terror, amazement, indignation, anger, and even grief, throw the mind into confusion, aggra­vate their objects, and of course prompt a  hyperbolical style. Hence the following sen­timents of Satan in Milton, as strongly as they are described, contain nothing but what is natural and proper; exhibiting the picture of a mind agitated with rage and despair:
Me miserable! which way shall I flie
Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
Which way I flie is Hell, myself am Hell;
And in the lowest depth, a lower deep
Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide,
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.    73.

IN simple description, though Hyperboles are not excluded, yet they must be used with more caution, and require more preparation, in order to make the mind relish them. Ei­ther the object described must be of that kind, which of itself seizes the fancy strong­ly, and disposes it to run beyond bounds; something vast, surprising, and new; or the writer art must be exerted in heating the fancy gradually, and preparing it to think highly of the object which he intends to ex­aggerate. When a Poet is describing an earthquake or a storm, or when he has brought us into the midst of a battle, we can bear strong Hyperboles without displeasure. But when he is describing only a woman in grief, it is impossible not to be disgusted with such wild exaggeration as the following, in one of our dramatic Poets:

 ”I found her on the floor
In all the storm of grief, yet beautiful;
Pouring forth tears at such a lavish rate,
That were the world on fire, they might have drowned
The wrath of Heaven, and quenched the migh­ty ruin.
LEE.

THIS is mere bombast. The person herself who was under the distracting agitations of grief, might be permitted to hyperbolize strongly; but the spectator describing her, cannot be allowed an equal liberty: for this plain reason, that the one is supposed to ut­ter the sentiments of passion, the other speaks only the language of description, which is al­ways, according to the dictates of nature, on a lower tone: a distinction, which how­ever obvious, has not been attended to by many writers.

HOW far a Hyperbole, supposing it pro­perly introduced, may be safely carried with­out overstretching it; what is the proper measure and boundary of this figure, cannot, as far as I know, be ascertained by any pre­cise rule. Good sense and just taste must determine the point, beyond which, if we pass, we become extravagant. Lucan may be pointed out as an author apt to be exces­sive in his Hyperboles. Among the compli­ments paid by the Roman Poets to their Em­perors, it had become fashionable to ask them, what part of the heavens they would chuse  for their habitation, after they should have become Gods? Virgil had already carried this sufficiently far in his address to Augustus:
 ”Tibi brachia contrahit ingens
Scorpius, & Coeli justa plus parte relinquit*."
"Georg. I."
"But this did not suffice Lucan. Resolved to outdo all his predecessors, in a like address to Nero, he very gravely beseeches him not to choose his place near either of the poles, but to be sure to occupy just the middle of the heavens, lest, by going either to one side or other, his weight should overset the uni­verse:"
"Sed neque in Arctoo sedem tibi legeris orbe"
"Nec polus adversi calidus qua mergitur austri;"
"Aetheris immensi partem si presseris unam"
"Sentiet axis onus. Librati pondera Coeli"
"Orbe tene medio  . ”"
"PHARS. I. 53."
" Such thoughts as these, are what the French call outrÃ  and always proceed from a false fire of genius. The Spanish and African writers, as Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustin, are remarked for being fond of them. As in that epitaph on Charles  by a Spanish writer:"
"Pro tumulo ponas orbem, pro tegmine coelum,"
"Sidera pro facibus, pro lacrymis maria."
"Sometimes they dazzle and impose by their boldness; but wherever reason and good sense are so much violated, there can be no true beauty. Epigrammatic writers are frequent­ly guilty in this respect; resting the whole merit of their epigrams on some extravagant hyperbolical turn; such as the following of Dr. Pitcairn  upon Holland being gained from the ocean:"
"Tellurem fecere Dii; sua littora Belgae;"
"Immensaeque molis opus utrumque fuit;"
"Dii vacuo sparsas glomerarunt aethere terras,"
"Nil ibi quod operi possit obesse fuit."
"At Belgis, maria & coeli naturaque rerum"
"Obstitit; obstantes hi domuÃªre Deos."
"So much for the Hyperbole. We proceed now to those figures which lie altogether in the thought; where the words are taken in their common and literal sense."
"Among these, the first place is unquesti­onably due to Personification, or that figure  by which we attribute life and action to ina­nimate objects. The technical term for this is Prosopopoia; but as Personification is of the same import, and more allied to our own language, it will be better to use this word."
"IT is a figure, the use of which is very extensive, and its foundation laid deep in human nature. At first view, and when considered abstractly, it would appear to be a figure of the utmost boldness, and to bor­der on the extravagant and ridiculous. For what can seem more remote from the tract of reasonable thought, than to speak of stones and trees, and fields and rivers, as if they were living creatures, and to attribute to them thought and sensation, affections and actions? One might imagine this to be no more than childish conceit, which no person of taste could relish. In fact, however, the case is very different. No such ridiculous effect is produced by Personification, when properly employed; on the contrary, it is found to be natural and agreeable; nor is any very uncommon degree of passion required, in order to make us relish it. All poetry, even in its most gentle and humble forms, abounds with it. From prose, it is far from being excluded; nay, in common conversa  very frequent approaches are made to it. When we say, the ground thirsts for rain, or the earth smiles with plenty; when we speak of ambitions being restless, or a disease being deceitful, such expressions show the  facility with which the mind can accommo­date the properties of living creatures to things that are inanimate, or to abstract con­ceptions of its own forming."
"INDEED, it is very remarkable, that there is a wonderful proneness in human nature to animate all objects. Whether this arises from a sort of assimilating principle, from a pro­pension to spread a resemblance of ourselves over all other things, or from whatever other cause it arises, so it is, that almost every emotion, which in the least agitates the mind, bestows upon its object a momentary idea of life. Let a man, by an unwary step, sprain his ankle, or hurt his foot upon a stone, and, in the ruffled discomposed moment, he will, sometimes, feel himself disposed to break the stone in pieces, or to utter passionate expres­sions against it, as if it had done him an in­jury. If one has been long accustomed to a certain set of objects, which have made a strong impression on his imagination; as to a house, where he has passed many agreeable years; or to fields, and trees, and mountains, among which he has often walked with the greatest delight; when he is obliged to part with them, especially if he has no prospect of ever seeing them again, he can scarce avoid having somewhat of the same feeling as when he is leaving old friends. They seem endow with life. They become objects of his affection; and, in the moment of his part  it scarce seems absurd to him, to give  vent to his feeling in words, and to take a formal adieu."
"So strong is that impression of life which is made upon us, by the more magnificent and striking objects of nature especially, that I doubt not, in the least, of this having been one cause of the multiplication of divinities in the Heathen world. Dryads and Naiads, the Genius of the wood, and the God of the river, were, in men of lively imaginations, in the early ages of the world, easily grafted upon this turn of mind. When their favou­rite rural objects had often been animated in their fancy, it was an easy transition to at­tribute to them some real divinity, some un­seen power or genius which inhabited them, or in some peculiar manner belonged to them. Imagination was highly gratified, by thus gaining somewhat to rest upon with more sta­bility; and when belief coincided so much with imagination, very slight causes would be sufficient to establish it."
"FROM this deduction, may be easily seen how it comes to pass, that personification makes so great a figure in all compositions, where imagination or passion have any con­cern. On innumerable occasions, it is the very Language of imagination and passion, and, therefore, deserves to be attended to, and examined with peculiar care. There are three different degrees of this figure; which it is necessary to remark and distinguish, in  order to determine the propriety of its use. The first is, when some of the properties or qualities of living creatures are ascribed to in­animate objects; the second, when those in­animate objects are introduced as acting like such as have life; and the third, when they are represented, either as speaking to us, or as listening to what we say to them."
"THE first, and lowest degree of this figure, consists in ascribing to inanimate objects some of the qualities of living creatures. Where this is done, as is most commonly the case, in a word, or two, and by way of an epi­thet added to the object, as, a raging storm, a deceitful disease, a cruel disaster,   it raises the style so little, that the hum­blest discourse will admit it without any force. This, indeed, is such an obscure gree of Personification, that one may doubt whether it deserves the name, and might not be classed with simple Metaphors, which escape in a manner unnoticed. Happily em­ployed, however, it sometimes adds beauty and sprightliness to an expression; as in this line of Virgil:"
"Aut conjurato descendens Dacus ab Istro."
"Geor.  474."
"Where the personal epithet, conjurato, applied to the river Istro, is infinitely more poetical than if it had been applied to the person, thus:"
"Aut conjuratus descendens Dacus ab Istro."
"A very little taste will make any one feel the difference between these two lines."
"THE next degree of this figure is, when we introduce inanimate objects acting like those that have life. Here we rise a step higher, and the Personification becomes sen­sible. According to the nature of the action, which we attribute to those inanimate ob­jects, and the particularity with which we describe it, such is the strength of the figure. When pursued to any length, it belongs only to studied harangues, to highly figured and eloquent discourse; when slightly touched, it may be admitted into subjects of less eleva  Cicero, for instance, speaking of the cases where killing another is lawful in self­defence, uses the following words: Aliquan­do nobis gladius occidendum hominem ab ipsis porrigitur legibus. (Orat. pro Milone.) The expression is happy. The laws are personified, as reaching forth their hand to give us a sword for putting one to death. Such short personifications as these may be admitted, even into moral treatises, or works of cool reasoning; and, provided they be easy and not strained, and that we be not cloyed with too frequent returns of them, they have a good effect on style, and render it both strong and lively."
" THE genius of our Language gives us an advantage in the use of this figure. As, with us, no substantive nouns have gender, or are masculine and feminine, except the proper names of male and female creatures; by giving a gender to any inanimate object, or abstract idea, that is, in place of the pronoun it, using the personal pronouns, he or she, we presently raise the style, and begin per­sonification. In solemn discourse, this can often be done to good purpose, when speak of religion, or virtue, or our country, or any such object of dignity. I shall give a remarkably fine example, from a sermon of Bishop Sherlock  where we shall see natu­ral religion beautifully personified, and be able to judge from it, of the spirit and grace which this figure, when well conducted, be­stows on a discourse. I must take notice, at the same time, that it is an instance of this figure, carried as far as prose, even in its highest elevation, will admit, and, there­fore, suited only to compositions where the great efforts of eloquence are allowed. The Author is comparing together our Saviour and Mahomet: Go, says he, to your natural Religion; lay before her Mahomet, and his disciples, arrayed in armour and blood, riding in triumph over the spoils of thousands who fell by his victorious sword. Shew her the cities which he set in flames, the countries which he ravaged and stroyed, and the miserable distress of all the inhabitants of the earth. When she  has viewed him in this scene, carry her in­to his retirement; shew her the Prophet chamber; his concubines and his wives; and let her hear him allege revelation, and a divine commission, to justify his adultery and lust. When she is tired with this pro­spect, then shew her the blessed Jesus, humble and meek, doing good to all the sons of men. Let her see him in his most retired privacies; let her follow him to the mount, and hear his devotions and sup­plications to God. Carry her to his table, to view his poor fare; and hear his heaven­ly discourse. Let her attend him to the tribunal, and consider the patience with which he endured the scoffs and reproaches of his enemies. Lead her to his cross; let her view him in the agony of death, and hear his last prayer for his persecutors; Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do! ”When Natural Religion has thus viewed both, ask, her, Which is the Prophet of God? But her answer we have already had, when she saw part of this scene, through the eyes of the Centu­rion, who attended at the cross. By him she spoke, and said, Truly, this man was the Son of God *. This is more than ele­gant; it is truly sublime. The whole pas­sage is animated; and the figure rises at the conclusion, when Natural Religion, who, before was only a spectator, is introduced as  speaking by the Centurion voice. It has the better effect too, that it occurs at the conclusion of a discourse, where we natural­ly look for most warmth and dignity. Did Bishop Sherlock sermons, or, indeed, any English sermons whatever, afford us many passages equal to this, we should oftner have recourse to them for instances of the beauty of Composition."
"HITHER TO we have spoken of prose; in poetry, Personifications of this kind are ex­tremely frequent, and are, indeed, the life and soul of it. We expect to find every thing animated in the descriptions of a poet who has a lively fancy. Accordingly Homer, the father and prince of poets, is remarkable for the use of this figure. War, peace, darts, spears, towns, rivers, every thing, in short, is alive in his writings. The same is the case with Milton and Shakespeare. No Personi­fication, in any author, is more striking, or introduced on a more proper occasion, than the following of Milton  on occasion of Eve eating the forbidden fruit:"
"So saying, her rash hand, in evil hour"
"Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat;"
"Earth felt the wound; and nature, from her seat"
"Sighing, through all her works, gave signs of woe,"
"That all was lost. ”"
"ix. 780."
"All the circumstances and ages of men, po­verty, riches, youth, old age, all the disposi­tions  and passions, melancholy, love, grief, contentment, are capable of being personifi in poetry, with great propriety. Of this, we meet with frequent examples in Milton Allegro and Penseroso, Parnell Hymn to Contentment, Thomson Seasons, and all the good poets: nor, indeed, is it easy to set any bounds to Personifications of this kind, in poetry."
"ONE of the greatest pleasures we receive from poetry, is, to find ourselves always in the midst of our fellows; and to see every thing thinking, feeling, and acting, as we ourselves do. This is, perhaps, the principal charm of this sort of figured style, that it in­troduces us into society with all nature, and interests us, even in inanimate objects, by forming a connection between them and us, through that sensibility which it ascribes to them. This is exemplified in the following beautiful passage of Thomson Summer, wherein the life which he bestows upon all nature, when describing the effects of the rising sun, renders the scenery uncommonly gay and interesting:"
"But yonder comes the powerful king of day"
"Rejoicing in the east. The lessening cloud,"
"The kindling azure and the mountain brim"
"Tipt with aethereal gold, his near approach"
"Betoken glad. ”"
" ”By thee refined,"
"In brisker measures, the relucent stream"
"Frisks er the mead. The precipice abrupt,"
" Projecting horror on the blackened flood,"
"Softens at thy return. The desart joys,"
"Wildly, through all his melancholy bounds."
"Rude ruins glitter; and the briny deep,"
"Seen from some pointed promontory top,"
"Reflects from every fluctuating wave,"
"A glance extensive as the day. ”"
"The same effect is remarkable in that fine passage of Milton:"
" ”To the nuptial bower,"
"I led her blushing like the morn. All heaven"
"And happy constellations, on that hour,"
"Shed their selectest influence. The earth"
"Gave signs of gratulation, and each hill."
"Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs"
"Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings"
"Flung rose, flung odour from the spicy shrub,"
"Disporting. ”"
"THE third and highest degree of this fi­gure remains to be mentioned, when inani­mate objects are introduced, not only as feeling and acting, but as speaking to us, or hearing and listening when we address our­selves to them. This, though on several oc­casions far from being unnatural, is, how­ever, more difficult in the execution, than the other kinds of Personification. For this is plainly the boldest of all rhetorical figures; it is the style of a strong passion only; and, therefore, never to be attempted, unless when the mind is considerably heated and agitated. A slight Personification of some inanimate thing, acting as if it had life, can be relished  by the mind, in the midst of cool description, and when its ideas are going on in the ordi­nary train. But it must be in a state of vio­lent emotion, and have departed considera­bly from its common tract of thought, be­fore it can so far realise the Personification of an insensible object, as to conceive it listen to what we say, or making any return to us. All strong passions, however, have a tendency to use this figure; not only love, anger, and indignation, but even those which are seemingly more dispiriting, such as, grief, remorse, and melancholy. For all passions struggle for vent, and if they can find no other object, will, rather than be silent, pour themselves forth to woods, and rocks, and the most insensible things; especially, if these be any how connected with the causes and objects that have thrown the mind into this agitation. Hence, in poetry, where the great­est liberty is allowed to the Language of pas­sion, it is easy to produce many beautiful examples of this figure. Milton affords us an extremely fine one, in that moving and ten­der address which Eve makes to Paradise, just before she is compelled to leave it."
"Oh! unexpected stroke, worse than of death!"
"Must I thus leave thee, Paradise! thus leave"
"Thee, native soil, these happy walks, and shades,"
"Fit haunt of Gods! where I had hope to spend"
"Quiet, though sad, the respite of that day,"
"Which must be mortal to us both. flowers!"
"That never will in other climate grow,"
"My early visitation, and my last"
" At ev  which I bred up with tender hand,"
"From your first op'ning buds, and gave you names!"
"Who now shall rear you to the sun, or rank"
"Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?"
"Book   268."
"This is altogether the language of nature, and of female passion. It is observable, that all plaintive passions are peculiarly prone to the use of this figure. The complaints which Philoctetes, in Sophocles, pours out to the rocks and caves of Lemnos, amidst the ex­cess of his grief and despair, are remarkably fine examples of it*. And there are fre­quent examples, not in poetry only, but in real life, of persons, when just about to suf­fer death, taking a passionate farewell of the sun, moon, and stars, or other sensible ob­jects around them."
"THERE are two great rules for the manage­ment of this sort of Personification. The first rule is, never to attempt it, unless when prompted by strong passion, and never to con­tinue it when the passion begins to flag. It is one of those high ornaments, which can  only find place in the most warm and spirited parts of composition; and there, too, must be employed with moderation."
"THE second rule is, never to personify any object in this way, but such as has some dig­nity in itself, and can make a proper figure in this elevation to which we raise it. The ob­servance of this rule is required, even in the lower degrees of Personification; but still more, when an address is made to the personified object. To address the corpse of a deceased friend, is natural; but to address the clothes which he wore, introduces mean and degrad ideas. So also, addressing the several parts of one body, as if they were animat  is not congruous to the dignity of passi­on. For this reason, I must condemn the following passage, in a very beautiful Poem of Mr. Pope  Eloisa to Abelard."
"Dear fatal name! rest ever unrevealed,"
"Nor pass these lips in holy silence sealed."
"Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise,"
"Where, mixed with Gods, his loved idea lies:"
"Oh! write it not, my hand! ”his name appears"
"Already written ”Blot it out, my tears!"
"Here are several different objects and parts of the body personified; and each of them are addressed or spoken to; let us consider with what propriety. The first is, the name of Abelard: Dear fatal name! rest ever,   To this, no reasonable objection can be made. For, as the name of a person often stands  for the person himself, and suggests the same ideas, it can bear this Personification with sufficient dignity. Next, Eloisa speaks to herself; and personifies her heart for this pur­pose: Hide it, my heart, within that close,   As the heart is a dignified part of the human frame, and is often put for the mind, or affections, this also may pass without blame. But, when from her heart she passes to her hand, and tells her hand not to write his name, this is forced and unnatural; a per­sonified hand is low, and not in the style of true passion: and the figure becomes still worse, when, in the last place, she exhorts her tears to blot out what her hand had written: Oh! write it not,   There is, in these two lines, an air of epigrammatic conceit, which native passion never suggests; and which is altogether unsuitable to the tender­ness which breathes through the rest of that exellent Poem."
"IN prose compositions, this figure requires to be used with still greater moderation and delicacy. The same liberty is not allowed to the imagination there, as in poetry. The same assistances cannot be obtained for raising passion to its proper height by the force of numbers, and the glow of style. However, addresses to inanimate objects are not ex­cluded from prose; but have their place only in the higher species of oratory. A public Speaker may on some occasions very properly address religion or virtue; or his native coun­try,  or some city or province, which has suf­fered perhaps great calamities, or been the scene of some memorable action. But we must remember, that as such addresses are among the highest efforts of eloquence, they should never be attempted, unless by persons of more than ordinary genius. For if the orator fails in his design of moving our pas­sions by them, he is sure of being laughed at. Of all frigid things, the most frigid, are the awkward and unseasonable attempts some­times made towards such kinds of Personifi­cation, especially if they be long continued. We see the writer or speaker toiling and bouring, to express the language of some pas­sion, which he neither feels himself, nor can make us feel. We remain not only cold, but frozen; and are at full leisure to criticise on the ridiculous figure which the personified object makes, when we ought to have been transported with a glow of enthusiasm. Some of the French writers, particularly Bossuet and Flechier, in their sermons and funeral orations, have attempted and executed this figure, not without warmth and dignity. Their works are exceedingly worthy of being consulted, for instances of this, and of several other ornaments of style. Indeed the viva­city and ardour of the French genius is more suited to this animated kind of oratory, than the more correct but more phlegmatic genius of the British, who in their prose works very rarely attempt any of the high figures of elo­quence*.  So much for Personifications or Prosopopoeia, in all its different forms."
" APOSTROPHE is a figure so much of the same kind, that it will not require many words. It is an address to a real person; but one who is either absent or dead, as if he were present, and listening to us. It is so much allied to an address to inanimate objects per­sonified, that both these figures are sometimes called apostrophes. However, the proper Apostrophe is in boldness one degree lower than the address to personified objects; for it certainly requires a less effort of imagina to suppose persons present who are dead or absent, than to animate insensible beings, and direct our discourse to them. Both fi­gures are subject to the same rule of being prompted by passion, in order to render them natural; for both are the language of passion or strong emotions only. Among the poets Apostrophe is frequent; as in Virgil:"
" ”Pereunt Hypanisque Dymasque"
"Confixi a sociis; nec te, tua plurima, Pantheu"
"Labentem pietas, nec Apollinis infula texit*!"
"The poems of Ossian are full of the most beautiful instances of this figure: Weep on the rocks of roaring winds, maid of Inistore! bend thy fair head over the waves, thou fairer than the ghost of the hills, when it moves in a sunbeam at noon over the silence of Morven! He is fallen! Thy youth is low; pale beneath the sword of  Cuchullin!* Quinctilian affords us a ve­ry fine example in prose; when in the be­ginning of his sixth book, deploring the un­timely death of his son, which had happened during the course of the work, he makes a very moving and tender Apostrophe to him. Nam quo ille animo, qua medicorum miratione, mensium octo valetudinem tulit? ut me in supremis consolatus est? quam etiam jam deficiens, jamque non noster, ipsum illum alienatae mentis errorem circa solas literas habuit? Tuosne ergo, meae spes inanes! labentes oculos, tuum fugien­tem spiritum vidi? Tuum corpus frigidum, exangue complexus, animam recipere, au­ramque communem haurire amplius potui? Tene, consulari nuper adoptione om­nium spes honorum patris admotum, te, avunculo praetori generum destinatum; te, omnium spe Atticae eloquentiae candida­tum, parens superstes tantum poenas amisi  ! In this passage, Quinctilian shews  the true genius of an orator, as much as he does elsewhere that of the critic."
"FOR such bold figures of discourse as strong Personifications, addresses to personified ob­jects, and Apostrophes, the glowing imagi­nation of the ancient Oriental nations was particularly fitted. Hence, in the sacred scriptures, we find some very remarkable in­stances: thou sword of the Lord! how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put thy­self up into thy scabbard, rest and be still! How can it be quiet, seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore? there hath he ap­pointed it*. There is one passage in par­ticular, which I must not omit to mention, because it contains a greater assemblage of sublime ideas, of bold and daring figures, than is perhaps any where to be met with. It is in the fourteenth chapter of Isaiah, where the prophet thus describes the fall of the As­syrian empire: Thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, how hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased! The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre of the rulers. He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke: he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted,  and none hindereth. The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing. Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us. Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stir­reth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth: it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. All they shall speak, and say unto thee, art thou also become weak as we? art thou be­come like unto us? Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. How art thou fallen from Heaven, Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into Heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to Hell, to the sides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly look up­on thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms? That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof? that opened not the house of his prisoners? All the Kings of the na­tions,  even all of them lie in glory, every one in his own house. But thou art cast out of thy grave, like an abominable branch: and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit, as a carcase trodden under feet. This whole passage is full of sublimity. Every object is animated; a va­riety of personages are introduced: we hear the Jews, the fir-trees, and cedars of Leba­non, the ghosts of departed Kings, the King of Babylon himself, and those who look upon his body, all speaking in their order, and act their different parts without confusion."
"LECTURE XVII. COMPARISON, ANTITHESIS, INTER­ROGATION, EXCLAMATION, AND OTHER FIGURES OF SPEECH."
"WE are still engaged in the consideration of figures of speech; which, as they add much to the beauty of style when pro­perly employed, and are at the same time liable to be greatly abused, require a careful discussion. As it would be tedious to dwell on all the variety of figurative expressions which rhetoricians have enumerated, I chose to select the capital figures, such as occur most frequently, and to make my remarks on these; the principles and rules laid down con­cerning them, will sufficiently direct as to the use of the rest, either in prose or poetry. Of Metaphor, which is the most common of them all, I treated fully; and in the last Lecture I discoursed of Hyperbole, Personification, and Apostrophe. This Lecture will nearly finish what remains on the head of Figures."
" COMPARISON, or simile, is what I am to treat of first: a Figure frequently employed both by Poets and Prose writers, for the or­nament of Composition. In a former Lec­ture, I explained fully the difference between this and Metaphor. A Metaphor is a com­parised implied, but not expressed as such; as when I say, Achilles is a Lion, mean  that he resembles one in courage or strength. A Comparison is, when the re­semblance between two objects is expressed in form, and generally pursued more fully than the nature of a Metaphor admits; as when I say, The actions of princes are like those great rivers, the course of which eve­ry one beholds, but their springs have been seen by few. This slight instance will show, that a happy Comparison is a kind of sparkling ornament, which adds not a little lustre and beauty to discourse; and hence such figures are termed by Cicero, Oratio­nis lumina."
"THE pleasure we take in comparisons is just and natural. We may remark three dif­ferent sources whence it arises. First, from the pleasure which nature has annexed to that act of the mind by which we compare any two objects together, trace resemblances among those that are different, and differ­ences among those that resemble each other; a pleasure, the final cause of which is, to prompt us to remark and observe, and there­by  to make us advance in useful knowledge. This operation of the mind is naturally and universally agreeable; as appears from the delight which even children have in compar things together, as soon as they are ca­pable of attending to the objects that sur­round them. Secondly, The pleasure of Com­parison arises from the illustration which the simile employed gives to the principal object; from the clearer view of it which it presents; or the more strong impression of it which it stamps upon the mind: and, thirdly, It arises from the introduction of a new, and com­monly a splendid object, associated to the principal one of which we treat; and from the agreeable picture which that object pre­sents to the fancy; new scenes being there­by brought into view, which, without the assistance of this figure, we could not have enjoyed."
"ALL Comparisons whatever may be re­duced under two heads, Explaining and Em­bellishing Comparisons. For when a writer likens the object of which he treats to any other thing, it always is, or at least always should be, with a view either to make us un­derstand that object more distinctly, or to dress it up, and adorn it. All manner of subjects admit of Explaining Comparisons. Let an author be reasoning ever so strictly, or treating the most abstruse point in philo­sophy, he may very properly introduce a  Comparison, merely with a view to make his subject be better understood. Of this nature, is the following in Mr. Harris Hermes, employed to explain a very abstract point, the distinction between the powers of sense and imagination in the human mind. As wax, says he, would not be adequate to the purpose of signatures, if it had not the power to retain as well as to receive the impression, the same holds of the soul with respect to sense and imagination. Sense is its receptive power; imagination its retentive. Had it sense without ima­gination, it would not be as wax, but as water, where, though all impressions be instantly made, yet as soon as they are made, they are instantly lost. In Com­parisons of this nature, the understanding is concerned much more than the fancy: and therefore the only rules to be observed, with respect to them, are, that they be clear, and that they be useful; that they tend to ren­der our conception of the principal object more distinct; and that they do not lead our view aside, and bewilder it with any false light."
"BUT embellishing Comparisons, introduced not so much with a view to inform and in­struct, as to adorn the subject of which we treat, are those with which we are chiefly concerned at present, as figures of speech; and those, indeed, which most frequently  occur. Resemblance, as I before mentioned, is the foundation of this Figure. We must not, however, take Resemblance, in too strict a sense, for actual similitude or likeness of appearance. Two objects may sometimes be very happily compared to one another, though they resemble each other, strictly speaking, in nothing; only, because they agree in the effects which they produce upon the mind; because they raise a train of similar, or, what may be called, concordant ideas; so that the remembrance of the one, when recalled, serves to strengthen the impression made by the other. For example, to describe the na­ture of soft and melancholy music, Ossian says, The music of Carryl was, like the memory of joys that are past, pleasant and mournful to the soul. This is happy and delicate. Yet, surely, no kind of music has any resemblance to a feeling of the mind, such as the memory of past joys. Had it been compared to the voice of the nightin­gale, or the murmur of the stream, as it would have been by some ordinary poet, the likeness would have been more strict; but, by founding his simile upon the effect which Carryl music produced, the Poet, while he conveys a very tender image, gives us, at the same time, a much stronger impression of the nature and strain of that music: Like the memory of joys that are past, pleasant and mournful to the soul."
" IN general, whether Comparisons be found on the similitude of the two objects com­pared, or on some analogy and agreement in their effects, the fundamental requisite of a comparison is, that it shall serve to illustrate the object, for the sake of which it is intro­duced, and to give us a stronger conception of it. Some little excursions of Fancy may be permitted, in pursuing the simile; but they must never deviate far from the princi­pal object. If it be a great and noble one, every circumstance in the comparison must tend to aggrandise it; if it be a beautiful one, to render it more amiable; if terrible, to fill us with more awe. But to be a little more particular: The rules to be given con­cerning Comparisons, respect chiefly two ar­ticles; the propriety of their introduction, and the nature of the objects whence they are taken."
"FIRST, the propriety of their introduction. From what has been already said of Compa­risons, it appears, that they are not, like the Figures of which I treated in the last Lec­ture, the language of strong passion. No; they are the language of imagination rather than of passion; of an imagination sprightly, indeed, and warmed; but undisturbed by any violent or agitating emotion. Strong passion is too severe to admit this play of Fancy. It has no leisure to cast about for resembling objects; it dwells on that object  which has seized and taken possession of the soul. It is too much occupied and filled by it, to turn its view aside, or to fix its atten on any other thing. An author, there­fore, can scarcely commit a greater fault, than, in the midst of passion, to introduce a Simile. Metaphorical expression may be al­lowable in such a situation; though even this may be carried too far: but the pomp and solemnity of a formal Comparison is altoge­ther a stranger to passion. It changes the key in a moment; relaxes and brings down the mind; and shews us a writer perfectly at his ease, while he is personating some other, who is supposed to be under the torment of agi­tation. Our writers of tragedies are very apt to err here. In some of Mr. Rowe plays, these flowers of similes have been strewed unseasonably. Mr. Addison Cato, too, is justly censurable in this respect; as, when Portius, just after Lucia had bid him farewel for ever, and when he should naturally have been represented as in the most violent an­guish, makes his reply in a studied and af­fected comparison:"
"Thus er the dying lamp  unsteady flame"
"Hangs quiv'ring on a point, leaps off by fits,"
"And falls again, as loth to quit its hold."
"Thou must not go; my soul still hovers er thee,"
"And can get loose."
" Every one must be sensible, that this is quite remote from the language of Nature on such occasions."
"HOWEVER, as Comparison is not the style of strong passion, so neither, when employed for embellishment, is it the language of a mind wholly unmoved. It is a figure of dig­nity, and always requires some elevation in the subject, in order to make it proper: for it supposes the imagination to be uncom­monly enlivened, though the heart be not agitated by passion. In a word, the proper place of comparisons lies in the middle re­gion between the highly pathetic, and the very humble style. This is a wide field, and gives ample range to the Figure. But even this field we must take care not to overstock with it. For, as was before said, it is a sparkling ornament; and all things that spar­kle, dazzle and fatigue, if they recur too often. Similies should, even in poetry, be used with moderation; but, in prose writ­ings, much more: otherwise, the style will become disgustingly luscious, and the orna­ment lose its virtue and effect."
"I PROCEED, next, to the rules that relate to objects, whence Comparisons should be drawn; supposing them introduced in their proper place."
" IN the first place, they must not be drawn from things, which have too near and obvi­ous a resemblance to the object with which we compare them. The great pleasure of the act of comparing lies, in discovering likenesses among things of different species, where we would not, at the first glance, ex­pect a resemblance. There is little art or in­genuity in pointing out the resemblance of two objects, that are so much a-kin, or lie so near to one another in nature, that every one sees they must be like. When Milton compares Satan appearance, after his fall, to that of the Sun suffering an eclipse, and affrighting the nations with portentous dark­ness, we are struck with the happiness and the dignity of the similitude. But, when he compares Eve bower in Paradise, to the arbour of Pomona; or Eve herself, to a Dryad, or Wood-nymph, we receive little entertainment: as every one sees, that one arbour must, of course, in several respects, resemble another arbour, and one beautiful woman another beautiful woman."
"AMONG Similies faulty through too great obviousness of the likeness, we must like­wise rank those which are taken from objects become trite and familiar in poetical Lan­guage. Such are the Similies of a hero to a lion, of a person in sorrow to a flower droop its head, of violent passion to a tempest, of chastity to snow, of virtue to the sun or  the stars, and many more of this kind, with which we are sure to find modern writers, of second rate genius, abounding plentifully; handed down from every writer of verses to another, as by hereditary right. These com­parisons were, at first, perhaps, very proper for the purposes to which they are applied. In the ancient original poets, who took them directly from nature, not from their prede­cessors, they had beauty. But they are now beaten; our ears are so accustomed to them, that they give no amusement to the fancy. There is, indeed, no mark by which we can more readily distinguish a poet of true geni­us, from one of a barren imagination, than by the strain of their comparisons. All who call themselves poets affect them: but, where­as a mere versifier copies no new image from nature, which appears, to his uninventive genius, exhausted by those who have gone before him, and, therefore, contents himself with humbly following their tract; to an author of real fancy, nature seems to un­lock, spontaneously, her hidden stores; and the eye quick glancing from earth to hea­ven, discovers new shapes and forms, new likenesses between objects unobserved before, which render his Similies original, expressive, and lively."
"BUT, in the second place, as Comparisons ought not to be founded on likenesses too ob­vious, still less ought they to be founded on  those which are too faint and remote. For these, in place of assisting, strain the fancy to comprehend them, and throw no light upon the subject. It is also to be observed, that a Comparison which, in the principal circumstances, carries a sufficiently near re­semblance, may become unnatural and ob­scure, if pushed too far. Nothing is more opposite to the design of this figure, than to hunt after a great number of coincidences in minute points, merely to show how far the poet wit can stretch the resemblance. This is Mr. Cowley common fault; whose com­parisons generally run out so far, as to become rather a studied exercise of wit, than an illus­tration of the principal object. We need only open his works, his odes especially, to find instances every where."
"IN the third place, the object from which a Comparison is drawn, should never be an unknown object, or one of which few people can form clear ideas: inferendam rebus lucem, says Quinctilian, repertae sunt similitudines. PraecipuÃ¨, igitur, est cus­todiendum ne quod similitudinis gratiÃ¢ ascivimus, aut obscurum sit, aut ignotum. Debet enim quod illustrandae alterius rei gratiÃ¢ assumitur, ipsum esse clarius eo quod illuminatur*. Comparisons, therefore,  founded on philosophical discoveries, or on any thing which persons of a certain trade only, or a certain profession, are conversant, at­tain not their proper effect. They should be taken from those illustrious, noted objects, which most of the readers either have seen, or can strongly conceive. This leads me to remark a fault of which modern poets are very apt to be guilty. The antients took their similies from that face of nature, and that class of objects, with which they and their readers were acquainted. Hence lions, and wolves, and serpents, were fruitful, and very proper sources of Similies amongst them; and these having become a sort of consecrat  classical images, are very commonly adopt by the moderns; injudiciously however, for the propriety of them is now in a great measure lost. It is only at second hand, and by description, that we are acquainted with many of those objects; and, to most readers of poetry, it were more to the purpose, to describe lions, or serpents, by Similies taken from men, than to describe men by lions. Now-a-days, we can much easier form the conception of a fierce combat between two men, than between a bull and a tyger. Eve­ry country has a scenery peculiar to itself; and the imagery of every good poet will ex­hibit  it. The introduction of unknown ob­jects, or of a foreign scenery, betrays a poet copying, not after nature, but from other writers. I have only to observe further,"
"IN the fourth place, that, in compositions of a serious or elevated kind, Similies should never be taken from low or mean objects. These are degrading; whereas, Similies are commonly intended to embellish, and to dig­nify: and, therefore, unless in burlesque writ­ings, or where Similies are introduced pur­posely to vilify and diminish an object, mean ideas should never be presented to us. Some of Homer Comparisons have been taxed without reason, on this account. For it is to be remembered, that the meanness or dignity of objects, depends, in a great degree, on the ideas and manners of the age wherein we live. Many Similies, therefore, drawn from the in­cidents of rural life, which appear low to us, had abundance of dignity in those simpler ages of antiquity."
"I HAVE now considered such of the figures of Speech as seemed most to merit a full and particular discussion: Metaphor, Hyperbole, Personification, Apostrophe, and Comparison. A few more yet remain to be mentioned; the proper use and conduct of which will be easily understood from the principles already laid down."
" AS Comparison is founded on the resem­blance, so Antithesis on the contrast or oppo­sition of two objects. Contrast has always this effect, to make each of the contrasted ob­jects appear in the stronger light. White, for instance, never appears so bright as when it is opposed to black; and when both are viewed together. Antithesis, therefore, may, on many occasions, be employed to advan­tage, in order to strengthen the impression which we intend that any object should make. Thus Cicero, in his oration for Milo, representing the improbability of Milo form a design to take away the life of Clodius, at a time when all circumstances were unfa­vourable to such a design, and after he had let other opp [...]unities slip when he could have executed the same design, if he had formed it, with much more ease and safety, heightens our conviction of this improbability by a skilful use of this figure: Quem igitur cum omnium gratiÃ¢ interficere noluit, hunc voluit cum aliquorum querelÃ¢? Quem jure, quem loco, quem tempore, quem impune, non est ausus, hunc injuriÃ¢, iniquo loco, alieno tempore, periculo capitis, non dubi­tavit occidere*? In order to render an  Antithesis more complete, it is always of vantage, that the words and members of the sentence, expressing the contrasted objects, be, as in this instance of Cicero  similarly con­structed, and made to correspond to each other. This leads us to remark the contrast more, by setting the things which we oppose more clearly over against each other; in the same manner as when we contrast a black and a white object, in order to perceive the full difference of their colour, we would chuse to have both objects of the same bulk, and placed in the same light. Their resemblance to each other, in certain circumstances, makes their disagreement in others more palpable."
"AT the same time, I must observe, that the frequent use of Antithesis, [...]pecially where the opposition in the words is nice and quaint, is apt to render style disagreeable. Such a sentence as the following, from Seneca, does very well, where it stands alone: Si quem volueris esse divitem, non est quod augeas divitias, sed minuas cupiditates*. Or this: Si naturam vives, nunquam eris pauper; si opinionem, nunquam dives  . A max­im, or moral saying, properly enough receives this form; both because it is supposed to be the fruit of meditation, and because it is signed to be engraven on the memory, which recalls it more easily by the help of such con­trasted  expressions. But where a string of such sentences succeed each other; where this be­comes an author favourite and prevailing manner of expressing himself, his style is faul­ty; and it is upon this account Seneca has been often, and justly, censured. Such a style appears too studied and laboured; it gives us the impression of an author attending more to his manner of saying things, than to the things themselves which he says. Dr. Young, though a writer of real genius, was too fond of Antitheses. In his Estimate of Human Life, we find whole pages that run in such a strain as this: The peasant complains aloud; the courtier in secret repines. In want, what distress? in affluence, what satiety? The great are under as much difficulty to expend with pleasure, as the mean to labour with success. The ignorant, through ill­grounded hope, are disappointed; the knowing, through knowledge, despond. Ig­norance, occasions mistake; mistake, disap­pointment; and disappointment is misery. Knowledge, on the other hand, gives true judgment; and true judgment of human things, gives a demonstration of their insuf­ficiency to our peace. There is too much glitter in such a style as this to please long. We are fatigued, by attending to such quaint and artificial sentences often repeated."
"THERE is another sort of Antithesis, the beauty of which consists, in surprising us by  the unexpected contrasts of things which it brings together. Much wit may be shewn in this; but it belongs wholly to pieces of professed wit and humour, and can find no place in grave compositions. Mr. Pope, who is remarkably fond of Antithesis, is often happy in this use of the figure. So, in his Rape of the Lock:"
"Whether the nymph shall break Diana law,"
"Or some frail china jar receive a flaw;"
"Or stain her honour, or her new brocade;"
"Forget her prayers, or miss a masquerade;"
"Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball,"
"Or whether heaven has doomed that Shock must fall."
"What is called the point of an epigram, con­sists, for most part, in some Antithesis of this kind; surprising us with the smart and un­expected turn, which it gives to the thought; and in the fewer words it is brought out, it is always the happier."
"COMPARISONS and Antitheses are figures of a cool nature; the productions of imagi­nation, not of passion. Interrogations and Exclamations, of which I am next to speak, are passionate figures. They are, indeed, on so many occasions, the native language of passion, that their use is extremely frequent; and, in ordinary conversation, when men are heated, they prevail as much as in the most sublime oratory. The unfigured, lite­ral  use of Interrogation, is, to ask a question; but when men are prompted by passion, whatever they would affirm, or deny, with great vehemence, they naturally put in the form of a question; expressing thereby the strongest confidence of the truth of their own sentiment, and appealing to their hear­ers for the impossibility of the contrary. Thus, in Scripture: God is not a man that he should lie, neither the son of man that he should repent. Hath he said it? And shall he not do it? Hath he spoken it? and shall he not make it good*? So Demost­henes, addressing himself to the Athenians: Tell me, will you still go about and ask one another, what news? What can be more astonishing news than this, that the man of Macedon makes war upon the Athenians, and disposes of the affairs of Greece? ”Is Philip dead? No, but he is sick. What signifies it to you whether he be dead or alive? For, if any thing hap­pens to this Philip, you will immediately raise up another. All this delivered with­out interrogation, had been faint and ineffec­tual; but the warmth and eagerness which this questioning method expresses, awakens the hearers, and strikes them with much greater force."
" INTERROGATIONS may often be employ with propriety, in the course of no higher emotions than naturally arise in pursuing some close and earnest reasoning. But Ex­clamations belong only to stronger emotions of the mind; to surprise, admiration, anger, joy, grief, and the like:"
"Heu pietas! heu prisca fides! invictaque bello"
"Dextera!"
"Both Interrogation and Exclamation, and, indeed, all passionate figures of speech, ope­rate upon us by means of sympathy. Sym­pathy is a very powerful and extensive prin­ciple in our nature, disposing us to enter in­to every feeling and passion, which we be­hold expressed by others. Hence, a single person coming into company with strong marks, either of melancholy or joy, upon his countenance, will diffuse that passion, in a moment, through the whole circle. Hence, in a great crowd, passions are so easily caught, and so fast spread, by that powerful conta­gion which the animated looks, cries, and gestures of a multitude never fail to carry. Now, Interrogations and Exclamations, be natural signs of a moved and agitated mind, always, when they are properly used, dispose us to sympathise with the dispositions of those who use them, and to feel as they feel."
" FROM this it follows, that the great rule with regard to the conduct of such figures is, that the writer attend to the manner in which nature dictates to us to express any emotion or passion, and that he give his lan­guage that turn, and no other; above all, that he never affect the style of a passion which he does not feel. With Interrogations he may use a good deal of freedom; these, as above observed, falling in so much with the ordinary course of language and reason  even when no great vehemence is sup­posed to have place in the mind. But, with respect to Exclamations, he must be more reserved. Nothing has a worse effect than the frequent and unseasonable use of them. Raw, juvenile writers imagine, that, by pouring them forth often, they render their compositions warm and animated. Whereas quite the contrary follows. They render it frigid to excess. When an author is always calling upon us to enter into transports which he has said nothing to inspire, we are both disgusted and enraged at him. He raises no sympathy, for he gives us no passion of his own, in which we can take part. He gives us words, and not passion; and of course, can raise no passion, unless that of indigna  Hence, I incline to think, he was not much mistaken, who said, that when, on looking into a book, he found the pages thick bespangled with the point which is call  Punctum admirationis, he judged this  to be a sufficient reason for his laying it aside. And, indeed, were it not for the help of this punctum admirationis, with which many writers of the rapturous kind so much abound, one would be often at a loss to discover, whe­ther or not it was Exclamation which they aimed at. For, it has now become a fashion, among these writers, to subjoin points of miration to sentences, which contain nothing but simple affirmations, or propositions; as if, by an affected method of pointing, they could transform them in the reader mind into high figures of eloquence. Much a-kin to this, is another contrivance practised by some writers, of separating, almost all the members of their sentences from each other, by blank lines; as if, by setting them thus asunder, they bestowed some special import­ance upon them; and required us, in going along, to make a pause at every other word, and weigh it well. This, I think, may be called a Typographical Figure of Speech. Neither, indeed, since we have been led to mention the arts of writers for increasing the importance of their words, does another custom, which prevailed very much some time ago, seem worthy of imitation; I mean that of distinguishing the significant words, in every sentence, by Italick characters. On some occasions, it is very proper to use such distinctions. But when we carry them so far, as to mark with them every supposed em­phatical word, these words are apt to mul­tiply  so fast in the author imagination, that every page is crowded with Italicks; which can produce no effect whatever, but to hurt the eye, and create confusion. Indeed, if the sense point out the most emphatical ex­pressions, a variation in the type, especially when occurring so frequently, will give small aid. And, accordingly, the most masterly writers, of late, have, with good reason, laid aside all those feeble props of significancy, and trusted wholly to the weight of their sentiments for commanding attention. But to return from this digression:"
"ANOTHER Figure of Speech, proper only to animated and warm Composition, is what some critical writers call Vision; when, in place of relating something that is past, we use the present tense, and describe it as actu­ally passing before our eyes. Thus Cicero, in his fourth oration against Catiline: deor enim mihi hanc urbem videre, lucem orbis terrarum atque arcem omnium gen­tium, subito uno incendio concidentem; cerno animo sepulta in patria miseros at­que insepultos acervos civium; versatur mihi ante oculos aspectus Cethegi, et furor, in vestra caede bacchantis*. This man­ner  of description supposes a sort of enthu­siasm, which carries the person who describes in some measure out of himself; and, when well executed, must needs impress the reader or hearer strongly, by the force of that sym­pathy which I have before explained. But, in order to a successful execution, it requires an uncommonly warm imagination, and such a happy selection of circumstances, as shall make us think we see before our eyes the scene that is described. Otherwise, it shares the same fate with all feeble attempts towards passionate figures; that of throwing ridicule upon the author, and leaving the reader more cool and uninterested than he was before. The same observations are to be applied to Repetition, Suspension, Correction, and ma­ny more of those figurative forms of Speech, which rhetoricians have enumerated among the Beauties of Eloquence. They are beau­tiful, or not, exactly in proportion as they are native expressions of the sentiment or passion intended to be heightened by them. Let nature and passion always speak their own language, and they will suggest figures in abundance. But when we seek to coun­terfeit a warmth which we do not feel, no figures will either supply the defect, or con­ceal the imposture."
" THERE is one Figure (and I shall mention no more) of frequent use among all public speakers, particularly at the bar, which Quinc­tilian insists upon considerably, and calls Am­plification. It consists in an artful exagge­ration of all the circumstances of some ob­ject or action which we want to place in a strong light, either a good or a bad one. It is not so properly one Figure, as the skilful management of several which we make to tend to one point. It may be carried on by a proper use of magnifying or extenuating terms, by a regular enumeration of particu­lars, or by throwing together, as into one mass, a crowd of circumstances; by suggest comparisons also with things of a like na­ture. But the principal instrument by which it works, is by a Climax, or a gradual rise of one circumstance above another, till our idea be raised to the utmost. I spoke formerly of a Climax in sound; a Climax in sense, when well carried on, is a figure which never fails to amplify strongly. The common example of this, is that noted passage in Cicero which every schoolboy knows: Facinus est vincire civem Romanum; scelus verberare, prope parricidium, necare; quid dicam in cru­cem tollere*? I shall give an instance from a printed pleading of a famous Scotch  Lawyer, Sir George Kenzie. It is in a charge to the jury, in the case of a woman accused of murdering her own child. Gen­tlemen, if one man had any how slain an­other, if an adversary had killed his op­poser, or a woman occasioned the death of her enemy, even these criminals would have been capitally punished by the Cor­nelian law: but, if this guiltless infant, who could make no enemy, had been mur­dered by its own nurse, What punishments would not then the mother have demand  With what cries and exclamations would she have stunned your ears? What shall we say then, when a woman, guilty of homicide, a mother, of the murder of her innocent child, hath comprised all those misdeeds in one single crime; a crime, in its own nature, detestable; in a woman, prodigious; in a mother, incredible; and perpetrated against one whose age called for compassion, whose near relation claim affection, and whose innocence deserv the highest favour? I must take notice, however, that such regular Climaxes as these, though they have considerable beauty, have, at the same time, no small appearance of art and study; and, therefore, though they may be admitted into formal harangues, yet they speak not the language of great earnestness and passion, which seldom proceed by steps so regular. Nor, indeed, for the purposes of effectual persuasion, are they likely to be  so successful, as an arrangement of circum­stances in a less artificial order. For, when much art appears, we are always put on our guard against the deceits of eloquence; but when a speaker has reasoned strongly, and, by force of argument, has made good his main point, he may then, taking advantage of the favourable bent of our minds, make use of such artificial figures to confirm our belief, and to warm our minds."

"OBSERVATIONS UPON A PAMPHLET, INTITLED, An Analysis of the Moral and Religious Sentiments contained in the Writings OF SOPHO, and DAVID HUME, Esq;  "
"A PAMPHLET having made its appearance lately, intitled, An Analysis of the Moral and Religious Sentiments contained in the Writings of SOPHO , and DAVID HUME, Esq, Addressed to the consideration of the Reverend and Honourable Members of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland; a few observations, which have occurred upon it, are here submitted to the public. The author zeal for religion would deserve the highest commendation, if, in some instances, it did not seem to be misguided, in others to exceed the bounds of true piety."
"T HE freedom of inquiry and debate, though  it may have published some errors to the world, has undoubtedly been the source from whence many blessings have flowed upon mankind. As free inquiry alone could at first have been made for Christianity, and have borne down the opposition of synagogues, senates and schools; it is to the same noble principle we owe the Reformation, and are enabled to set at defiance the tyrannical decisions of Popes and Councils. By means of free inquiry, the church of Scotland was originally established. In this country, therefore, all attempts to infringe so valuable a privilege in cases where the peace of society is not concerned, must ever be regarded with concern by all reasonable men."
"The proper objects of censure and reproof are not freedom of thought, but licentiousness of action; not erroneous speculations, but crimes pernicious to society. Against these ought the Clergy to exert their utmost efforts; and by such a conduct they will more advance the cause of religion, than by engaging in metaphysical disputes, which may perplex the understandings, but never can impair the morals of men."
"THE intention of the following observations is by no means to enter into any controversy, but solely to examine, whether the Author of the Analysis has not, in many instances, misrepresented the meaning, and quoted unfairly the words of those books he would expose to censure. It will be admitted without dispute, that, to cite one part of a paragraph, and omit the other, which  clares or explains the meaning of the author, is no less culpable than to falsify the words."
"THE first Proposition of the Analysis is,—"
"There is no necessary relation between cause and effect."
"T prove this to be the doctrine of the Author of the Essays on the Principles of Morality, several passages are adduced; two from  274. and 275. and one from  296. These passages, though  they do not directly prove the proposition, yet it must be owned, that, as they stand in the Analysis, they have a great tendency towards it; but when those which immediately follow them are added, the direct contrary proposition appears evidently to be maintained. Thus the Analysis quotes,  5. "
"THE last citation is so unfairly culled from a page where both what goes before, and what follows it, contradict the proposition of the Analysis, that it is but fair to transcribe it entire. "
"The second proposition of the Analysis is—"
"Matter is possessed of a power of self-motion."
"H the Analysis said endued instead of possessed, the proposition had been fairly stated, or if citation from  12. of the Essay on motion had been continued, and those sentences in the middle which are purposely omitted, inserted; the doctrine would have appeared to be the same in this point with that which is maintained by the best and most orthodox philosophers."
"The paragraph immediately following the quotation is  14. "
"The third proposition of the Analysis is —"
"Nothing appears from reason that can induce us to think that the world is not eternal."
"NOTHING can be more remote from the doctrine of the Essays than the eternity of the world. The context of the three citations from  317, 318, and 319. which is purposely omitted, would sufficiently prove this to any man of candour. But the passage in  344. must remove all dispute upon this point."
"TO follow the Analysis through  every article, would be tedious and disagreeable: one other instance shall only be adduced of this species of false quotation. The 5th Proposition is, The perfections of God are either such as we cannot prove, or cannot comprehend."
"T HE first citation is picked out from the midst of a paragraph, where the preceding and following passages are in direct contradiction to the proposition. The whole stands thus: "
"the passage cited in the Analysis. "
"I imagine it will scarcely be denied, that to quote thus, is to quote falsely, since, by the same method, any author might be made to speak things the most opposite to his sentiment. But, should there be any hesitation upon this point, it is undoubted, That when a treatise professes to give "
"IF there should be found passages which are neither the words, nor the meaning of the author, the falsehood cannot be palliated, nor excused."
"An instance of this method of citation occurs in  23. Art. 5. of the Analysis."
"The words quoted are, "
"page there is no such sentence, neither is there any such sentiment to be found. The passage from the beginning in  139, is as follows."
"THAT the words quoted in the Analysis are not to be found here is evident; it is almost as clear, that the sentiment contained in them is very different from the passage in the Essays. A very common observation is there advanced, viz. That the vulgar are more swayed by passion than principle, and not much influenced by general ideas. No man of candour can imagine this to be synonymous to the sentence quoted in the Analysis."
"A NOTHER instance of the same kind occurs in  15. of the Analysis. The words quoted are, "
"THE page from which they are cited is the 164. The passage is no where to be found in the page. It must indeed be acknowledged, that in the 7th line of the page, the 1st sentence of this passage is to be found. Some imperfect traces of the 2d sentence may be observed in the 20th line of the same page, and in the 8th line of the subsequent one, something like the last sentence may also be discovered."
"A ND I here ask, If it be candid or honest to cite an author in this manner, and to aver that the very expressions are quoted? To glean disunited sentences, to patch them together arbitrarily, to omit the limitations or remarks with which a proposition is delivered; can this be stiled exhibiting the sentiments of an author? I hope I shall not be thought to  viate into anything ludicrous, when I refer the Reader to a well known treatise of the Dean of St. Patrick  in which the inquisitorial method of interpretation used in the church of Rome is by so just and so severe raillery rendered detestable."
"Si non totidemsententiis, asttotidemverbis; si non totidemverbis, asttotidemsyllabis, si non totidemsyllabis, asttotidemliteris. This is the genuine logic of persecution. From arts such as these have the unhappy divisions which so long distracted the church been derived. At a period when mankind are fully sensible of the blessings they enjoy, and liberty both civil and ecclesiastical is become the dearest possession of the people, and the favourite care of the Prince; what sentiments ought the revival of those insidious and Jesuitical principles to excite in every sincere friend to our present constitution in Church and State! Most of the members of the Church of Scotland are, I dare say, animated with a fervent zeal for religion: But, knowing that the perfection of religion is the spirit of moderation, they prize too highly the good of the church to give ear to the counsels of a violent and unchristian zeal, which, by adopting the arts, may justly be thought to pursue the ends of persecution. More has perhaps been said upon those instances of (what must be called) direct falsehood in the author of the Analysis, than was at first proposed. But it cannot be surprising, that they should excite some indignation. To affect a zeal against heresy, and at the same time to disregard truth, must appear to every one highly culpable and very unchristian."
"I now only remains to quote those passages in which the Author of the Analysis seems to have wilfully mistaken the meaning of the Essays. It is but fair to suppose, that he has read the whole of the book before he would pretend to censure it. The only proof therefore of his misrepresentations shall be to cite those passages, which, upon this supposition, he could not be ignorant of."
"The fourth Proposition of the Analysis is, The powers of reason can give us no satisfying evidence of the being of a God."
"THE misrepresentation here consists chiefly in the query subjoined, which would induce us to believe, that the Author of the Essays disputed the Being of a God. The falsehood of this will appear from the following passages,  320. Ess. "
"The sixth Proposition of the Analysis is, It is whimsical and absurd to pretend, that the material world is subject to the providence of God."
"THE passages already quoted from Mr. Boyle are sufficient to set this in its true light."
"THE 7th Proposition being obviously true, if fairly understood, needs no comment."
"The eighth Proposition deserves some more attention. It is, Man is a mere machine, under an irresistible necessity in all his actions."
"IT is clear, from many passages in the Essays, that the Author no where meant to inculcate physical necessity.  172. "
"IT is clear also from the passage preceding that which is cited in the Analysis, from  163. that it is not a blind fatal necessity that is argued for, but a necessity derived from the will of the Deity."
"IF we insert into this quotation the sentence which is omitted in the Analysis, we shall have a very compleat instance of the unfair proceedings of its author: after he has a power of beginning motion, these words are omitted; "
"THAT man is under a moral necessity arising from the will of the Deity, is therefore the position of the Essays. It will scarcely be denied, that the doctrine of this church is the same, and that Calvin, Beza, Turretin, have all maintained it in their several systems. This subject is fully treated in the accurate Treatise lately published by the Reverend Mr. Edwards of New-England."
"THE 9th and 10th Propositions may be considered together, since unfairness of the Analysis here consists of imputing to an Author consequences which he refuses to admit."
"THE opinion of deceitful feelings we may justly call new and singular."
"We may hold it to be unphilosophical, or deny it to be true. But, I confess, I do not see how it can be stated as heretical, with regard to the consequence attempted to be deduced from it, "
"in the Analysis prove his opinion."
"Analysis,  21. cites a passage from  209. of the Essays: the sentence which begins the paragraph is as follows, "
"IN  20th of the Analysis, the passage cited from  63. of the Essays is, "
"follows is,) "
"The eleventh Proposition is—"
"That since man is thus necessarily determined in all his actions, and can have nothing more than a deceitful feeling of liberty, it follows as a necessary consequence, that there can be no sin or moral evil in the world."
"A passage, which could not have escaped the observation of the author of the Analysis, will best explain this proposition. It is a note on  182. "
"WERE the author of the Analysis to meet with no greater degree of candour than he has shewn to others; it were not unnatural to conclude, from his extracts from Mr. UME , that his zeal for religion was more affected than real. Every fair reader must admit, and regret, that there are to be found in the writings of this elegant Author some principles by no means consistent with sound doctrine. There was therefore no necessity for ascribing to him positions which he does not advance, in order to support the charge of irreligion against him. This conduct of the author of the Analysis can scarcely be accounted for; as it manifestly leads to do harm rather than good to the cause he pretends to support. But as it is more charitable to impute it to error than to evil intention, a very few observations upon it will suffice."
"THE first Proposition of the Analysis is,—"
"All distinction between virtue and vice is merely imaginary."
"E VERY one who has the most superficial knowledge of Mr. UME  writings must know, that he is very far from denying the reality of moral distinctions. The passages quoted by no means prove the proposition, neither are they fairly cited."
"THE first citation from  239. is the conclusion of a paragraph; the beginning of which is as follows; "
"THE second citation from  235. is as unfairly stated. The words which follow those quoted are; "
"THE third citation from  99.  2. ought to have been explained by what went before it, which is, "
"IT is by no means candid in the author of the Analysis to quote the passage from  29.  4. ‡ singly; because, as it stands in the Essay, it makes part of a reasoning, the tendency of which is by no means immoral, as the passage going before it clearly shews. "
"IN  31. of the Analysis, we find the following sentence cited from the Essays,  I .  163. "
"passage, which must be sought for in  162. is followed by "
"find the conclusion in these words, "
"WITH regard to the other propositions, it is sufficient to observe, that Mr."
"HUME ’ writings, to any candid reader, exhibit no defence of adultery; and are very far from containing any principles of licentiousness. Justice demands this acknowledgment as due to an elegant and agreeable writer, even though a Free-Thinker; and it must at the same time be observed, that it appears very like a contradiction to accuse a man in one page of scepticism and infidelity, and in the following page to tax him with an attachment to Popery and superstition."
"FROM the whole survey of this Analysis, the misrepresentations and false quotations contained in it are evident. It may now, therefore, be not improper to inquire a little into the scope of it."
"A number of the most horrible propositions are published in large letters, as extracted from the writings of two Gentlemen; and mangled perverted passages are produced, in order to prove so dreadful a charge. Many persons, it may be thought, will never go farther than the Propositions themselves, which are certainly sufficient to excite detestation in every sober Christian. Very few, it may be presumed, will look beyond the passages by which the Propositions seem to be supported, or consult the books from which these passages are extracted: and still fewer are capable of discernment on so delicate a subject. By arts such as these, are the characters of two Gentlemen attacked and defamed. The public will judge with how little justice, and how little candour this attack has been carried on. It is unnecessary to add any thing further. The Observations have been confined mostly to matters of fact. All reflexions upon the author of the Analysis, even after so full a detection, have, it is hoped, been avoided. As in common life, the habit of a clergyman ought to secure a regard to the wearer, even though it should happen to cover envy, malice, and falsehood; so ought a zeal for religion, whether real or affected, to be always treated with proper respect."
